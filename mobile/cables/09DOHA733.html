<br>SUBJECT: VISIT OF QATAR'S PRIME MINISTER TO WASHINGTON 
<br>JANUARY 4-5 
<br> 
<br>DOHA 00000733  001.2 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Joseph E. LeBaron, for reasons 1.4 (b, d) 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (S) Prime Minister Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani (who serves 
<br>concurrently as Foreign Minister) of Qatar will visit 
<br>Washington beginning January 4 to continue the strategic 
<br>consultations that Qatar and the USG have pursued since June, 
<br>when Near Eastern Affairs Assistant Secretary Feltman first 
<br>proposed them in Doha.  As part of those consultations, 
<br>Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Ahmed Al-Mahmoud and 
<br>Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs Mohamad Al-Rumaihi 
<br>visited Washington last fall. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S) The Prime Minister travels to Washington with the aim 
<br>of laying the groundwork for visits in the first half of 2010 
<br>by Qatar's Heir Apparent and the Amir.  We believe he will be 
<br>prepared to discuss the gaps between the USG and GOQ on 
<br>Middle East peace and counterterrorism cooperation, as well 
<br>as to discuss setting  the stage for joint cooperation on 
<br>Iran, Iraq and other regional issues. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S) Suggested talking points for meetings with the PM: 
<br> 
<br>-- We thank you for bringing with you to Washington a 
<br>commitment to fund the PA.  Your decision to do so is 
<br>extremely important to us.  We view it as a clear gesture of 
<br>friendship to us and of a commitment to partner with us on 
<br>Fatah-Hamas reconciliation, just as the United States and 
<br>Qatar have partnered on Darfur. 
<br> 
<br>-- As your ally and friend, we hope we can look to you to 
<br>increase your cooperation with us on counterterrorism.  We 
<br>want to work particularly closely with you and enacting 
<br>policies and programs that deter financial flows to Hamas and 
<br>the Taliban. 
<br> 
<br>-- In this context, we applaud your work with the IMF on 
<br>making needed legal and procedural changes to curtail 
<br>financing to terrorists.  We are ready to help you with 
<br>technical support and training once the IMF and Qatar have 
<br>worked out an action plan. 
<br> 
<br>-- We especially value consultations with you on Iran.  We 
<br>recognize your national need for a working relationship with 
<br>Iran, given the natural gas reserves you share with Iran. 
<br>How best do you think we can persuade Iran to give up its 
<br>military nuclear aims without military confrontation? 
<br> 
<br>-- We understand that you are close to announcing a decision 
<br>to open an Embassy in Baghdad, but that much depends on 
<br>resolving the issue of Iraq's debts to Qatar.  Is there 
<br>anything we can do to help? 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>-- We encourage you to recognize an independent Kosovo, as 
<br>Saudi Arabia and others have now done.  We certainly 
<br>appreciate your votes in favor of Kosovo in the IMF and World 
<br>Bank.  They are important precursors to formal recognition, 
<br>but when will you take that final step? 
<br> 
<br>-- On Yemen, we know that President Saleh asked Qatar to stop 
<br>its mediation between the central government and Huthi 
<br>rebels.  Given your past involvement there, what thoughts do 
<br>you have on bringing about stability on the Arabian 
<br>Peninsula? 
<br> 
<br>-- We applaud Qatar's decision to make food security a 
<br>priority, not just for itself but for the entire Arab world. 
<br>Food security is a priority for the USG, as well, and we 
<br>share Qatar's view that it must be addressed through a 
<br>combination of commerce, investment, technical assistance, 
<br>technology transfer, and direct aid. 
<br> 
<br>Addressing the Fatah-Hamas Split and Funding the PA 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (S) Prime Minister Hamad bin Jassim (HBJ) has told NEA A/S 
<br>Feltman that he will come with a financial commitment to fund 
<br>the Palestinian Authority.  This is an extremely important 
<br>gesture by Qatar to the United States.  He will also be 
<br>prepared to discuss with Secretary Clinton and others Qatar's 
<br>view of Hamas, continued contacts with whose leaders it sees 
<br>as key to bringing about a stable and enduring Middle East 
<br>peace.  We expect HBJ to share what other steps Qatar is 
<br>prepared to take in support of the Palestinian Authority (PA) 
<br>and, in particular, Mahmoud Abbas, whose continued leadership 
<br> 
<br>DOHA 00000733  002.2 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>of the PA Qatar's leaders support.  HBJ is likely to bring 
<br>with him new ideas to reconcile Hamas and Fatah.  Given 
<br>Qatar's history of mediation efforts HBJ will no doubt 
<br>suggest that Qatar can play a helpful role.  Qatar's 
<br>restoration of normal operations of the Israeli Trade Office 
<br>in Doha would also give testimony to Qatar's willingness to 
<br>help achieve U.S. objectives, but we do not expect the 
<br>Qataris to take this step absent some significant gesture 
<br>from the Israelis, such as much less restricted access to 
<br>Gaza for Qatar's humanitarian efforts. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (S) Qatar almost certainly will not be willing to break 
<br>off ties or dialogue with Hamas.  If asked to do so, we think 
<br>HBJ will explain that the Amir gave his word to both Hamas 
<br>and Fatah that he would financially support the winner of 
<br>democratic elections in Palestine.  Hamas won those 
<br>elections, which the Bush Administration pressed the Amir to 
<br>support actively.  The Amir believes that it would be 
<br>dishonorable to isolate Hamas after he convinced its leaders 
<br>to participate in elections that were backed by the United 
<br>States. 
<br> 
<br>Greater Cooperation on Counterterrorism Needed 
<br>--------------------------------------------- - 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (S) It is important to make clear to HBJ that cooperation 
<br>between the United States and Qatar on counterterrorism 
<br>issues in general needs to be greatly improved.  Officials 
<br>should make known USG concerns about the financial support to 
<br>Hamas by Qatari charitable organizations and our concerns 
<br>about the moral support Hamas receives from Yousef 
<br>Al-Qaradawi.  It is also essential to stress that high-level 
<br>Qatari political support is needed, if financial flows to 
<br>terrorists are to stop. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (S) An International Monetary Fund (IMF) employee began 
<br>advising Qatar's Financial Intelligence Unit in October (in a 
<br>relationship expected to last three full years) on making the 
<br>necessary legal and procedural changes to address the 49 
<br>areas in which international experts have recommended changes 
<br>to Qatar's procedures.  We assess that the FIU is serious 
<br>about making technical changes that will enhance Qatar's 
<br>reputation as a global financial center, but we project that, 
<br>absent political support from the top, the IMF/Qatari 
<br>partnership will fall short in achieving its goals. 
<br> 
<br>Need for Close Consultations on Iran 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (S) Qatar shares a mammoth natural gas field with Iran. 
<br>As a result, Qatar carefully maintains with Iran a high tempo 
<br>of top-level contacts , which have increased since the 
<br>protests following Iranian presidential elections).  Qatar 
<br>does this because it is convinced that such a close 
<br>relationship with Iran is key to safeguarding trillions of 
<br>dollars in potential wealth.  We are convinced that Qatar 
<br>will not be dissuaded from maintaining those ties. 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (S) That said, Qatar's leaders -- while careful not to say 
<br>it publicly -- do not trust Iran; and Qatar does not want 
<br>Iran to have nuclear weapons. 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (S) Qatar's relationship with Iran is important to us 
<br>for another reason.  Qatar hosts the forward headquarters of 
<br>CENTCOM and allows us to use Al-Udaid Air Base for 
<br>unrestricted air operations over Iraq and Afghanistan.  We 
<br>pay no rent for these facilities, and the Qataris have funded 
<br>about 60 percent of the improvements to Al-Udaid since our 
<br>partnership on that base began.  While few, least of all 
<br>Qatar, want a military confrontation with Iran, the USG no 
<br>doubt would want to use these Qatari facilities in any 
<br>kinetic operations against Iran.  Right now, we anticipate 
<br>that Qatar would refuse to allow Qatari soil to be used to 
<br>attack Iran, short of some sort of permanent USG security 
<br>guarantee to Qatar, to include its offshore natural gas field 
<br>shared with Iran. 
<br> 
<br>Finding a Way Forward on Iraq 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (S) For several months, Qatar has expressed frustration 
<br>with the current government of Iraq, which it views as too 
<br>Shi'a in orientation for its liking, but appears now to be 
<br>prepared to consider investment offsets, provided by the 
<br>Government of Iraq, but owned by Qatar, as a means for Iraq 
<br> 
<br>DOHA 00000733  003.2 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>to repay the GOI's debt owed Qatar.  That would be an avenue 
<br>for the resumption of a political relationship, to include an 
<br>HBJ visit to Baghdad and the opening of a Qatari Embassy in 
<br>Iraq.  We should encourage Qatar's outreach to Baghdad and 
<br>also encourage Iraq's government to shore up its relations 
<br>with Doha. 
<br> 
<br>Recognizing Kosovo 
<br>------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (C) MFA Assistant Minister Mohamad Al-Rumaihi told 
<br>Ambassador December 20 that Qatar's IMF and World Bank votes 
<br>in favor of Kosovo show Qatar's true sympathies on 
<br>recognizing Kosovo.  The Russian President, however, has 
<br>asked Qatar to "go slow" in announcing recognition, he said. 
<br>Out of sensitivity to Russian concerns, Al-Rumaihi said, 
<br>Qatar has done so.  He encouraged Secretary Clinton to ask 
<br>HBJ about the timing of Qatar's eventual recognition, noting 
<br>that that Qatar had been approached by organizers of a UK 
<br>project about using its good offices with the Government of 
<br>Kosovo to protect Kosovo's Christian heritage once Qatar 
<br>formally recognizes its independence. 
<br> 
<br>Cool to Yemen's Approach on the Huthi 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (S) Having attempted to mediate between Huthi rebels in 
<br>Yemen and the central government there (before President 
<br>Saleh put an end to Qatar's involvement), Qatar believes the 
<br>Huthi tribes have legitimate grievances that the central 
<br>government must address in dialogue and negotiations.  It can 
<br>be expected that HBJ will discourage a military approach to 
<br>solving the Huthi problem and claim that the role of Huthi 
<br>elements in supporting terrorism in the guise of Al-Qaida is 
<br>overstated. 
<br> 
<br>Food Security 
<br>------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶14. (U) Qatar will host March 3-4, 2010 an international 
<br>conference focused on food security in the Arab World.  IFAD 
<br>(International Fund for Agricultural Development) is a 
<br>co-host, as is the Islamic Development Bank.  The conference 
<br>will have a set of ambitious goals, to include a conference 
<br>declaration establishing a permanent secretariat to address 
<br>the food security issues of the poorer states of the Arab 
<br>League.  According to officials of Texas A&M's Borlaug 
<br>Institute, this will be the first such conference on regional 
<br>food security issues hosted by an Arab government in the 50 
<br>years the institute has been active in the Middle East and 
<br>North Africa. 
<br> 
<br>¶15. (SBU) In Embassy Doha's judgment, Qatar's food security 
<br>policies and strategies reflect the rapidly growing intent by 
<br>the Amir and Crown Prince to make food security a key 
<br>national priority for Qatar, not just in terms of Qatar's own 
<br>food security needs, but in terms of the food security needs 
<br>of the Arab region. (HBJ supports having an active food 
<br>security policy, as long as it has a strong commercial focus.) 
<br> 
<br>¶16. (SBU) That judgment stems from our conversations with 
<br>Qatar government officials: 
<br> 
<br>-- While QNFSP's short-term focus is on the State of Qatar 
<br>and building the domestic agricultural sector to diminish 
<br>reliance on imports, the strategic goal of QNFSP is to export 
<br>the technologies developed in Qatar to countries throughout 
<br>the MENA region, and other areas with arid climates. 
<br> 
<br>-- Toward that end, some research results will be part of the 
<br>public domain and available to everyone.  Some technology 
<br>transfer to poorer MENA nations will be donor-based, through 
<br>the activities of the offices of the State Minister for 
<br>International Cooperation.  The third component of Qatar's 
<br>strategic goal of exporting QNFSP technology will be more 
<br>commercially based, and will employ public/private 
<br>partnerships.
