<br>
<br>Classified By: Amb. Eduardo A. Aguirre Jr. for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: During his trip to Ronda in southern
<br>Spain's Andalucia region, Ambassador Aguirre spent the
<br>afternoon and evening of September 9 with Foreign Minister
<br>Miguel Angel Moratinos. Ambassador pressed Moratinos on
<br>recent incendiary comments from President Zapatero regarding
<br>Iraq, and he raised the pending sale of patrol boats to
<br>Venezuela. Outside the confines of the capital, Moratinos
<br>spoke candidly about several issues, voicing pessimism about
<br>progress on Iran and Syria and expressing confidence in his
<br>position within the GOS. He indicated that Spain's top
<br>foreign policy priorities are the Middle East, North Africa
<br>(Western Sahara and the Moroccan bilateral relationship), and
<br>the continuing issue of illegal immigration from Sub-Saharan
<br>Africa. Moratinos also touched on the recent shakeup in his
<br>ministry with the addition of Trini Jimenez at the deputy
<br>minister level, saying that he expected Deputy FM Bernardino
<br>Leon's influence would not be adversely impacted and Leon
<br>would retain direct control of relations with the U.S., Cuba
<br>and Bolivia, three key foreign policy issues for Spain. In a
<br>September 11 telcon with Ambassador, Leon expressed the same
<br>sentiment. END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>//IRAN, SYRIA, LEBANON//
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Moratinos asked whether Ambassador had seen his
<br>letter to Secretary Rice on the Middle East/Iran (faxed from
<br>Spanish Embassy Washington to EUR/WE on September 8) and said
<br>he hoped he would have the chance to follow up with the
<br>Secretary at UNGA. Ambassador promised to check on the
<br>
<br>SIPDIS
<br>Secretary's reply.
<br>
<br>SIPDIS
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Moratinos expressed pessimism on Iran, and he is
<br>increasingly inclined to view the issue as a global crisis.
<br>He said that a solution to Iran's nuclear ambitions may be
<br>beyond reach. Moratinos told Ambassador that the recent
<br>visit by Iranian nuclear negotiator Ali Lariyani came at
<br>Iran's request. According to Moratinos, President Zapatero
<br>agreed to the visit warily, and his meeting with Lariyani was
<br>nothing more than an exchange of pleasantries. NOTE:
<br>Embassy will report septel on Spain's Iran activism. END
<br>NOTE.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Regarding the recent trip to Iran of former Spanish
<br>President Felipe Gonzalez, Moratinos said that no one in the
<br>GOS had asked him to go, although they did not object when
<br>Gonzalez notified them of his intended travel. Moratinos
<br>expressed disappointment in Gonzalez' comments in Iran,
<br>saying that there was no value added, but perhaps some value
<br>lost. NOTE: In his remarks, Gonzalez went well beyond the
<br>current Western position on Iran, stating that the current
<br>crisis was an opportunity for engagement and defending Iran's
<br>right to nonmilitary nuclear development. END NOTE.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Ambassador, drawing on ref points, asked Moratinos
<br>for Spain's help in ensuring that Hizbollah not be allowed to
<br>rearm, that the Syrian-Lebanese border be tightly monitored,
<br>and that Syria be held accountable for any re-supply of
<br>Hizbollah. Moratinos said that he was of the same mind.
<br>Moratinos also noted that Spain's presence in Lebanon was
<br>critical and was evidence of their unwavering commitment to a
<br>solution in the Middle East.
<br>
<br>//ZAPATERO OFF MESSAGE//
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Ambassador took the opportunity to raise the recent
<br>controversial comments made by President Zapatero in a
<br>September 8 interview in Germany, in which the Spanish
<br>President seemed to go out of his way to blame international
<br>terrorism on the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Ambassador told
<br>Moratinos that his understanding was that the GOS was going
<br>to put Iraq in the past in the interest of the bilateral
<br>relationship. Ambassador said that he had chosen not to
<br>respond to these particular remarks, part of what has been an
<br>ongoing nuisance. However, if the Government of Spain wished
<br>to continue with its rhetorical barbs, then the Ambassador
<br>would oblige. Moratinos responded that he too was perturbed
<br>by Zapatero's comments and spoke with the President after the
<br>interview. He stated his belief that Zapatero would refrain
<br>from such statements in the future. NOTE: In his September
<br>
<br>MADRID 00002281 002 OF 002
<br>
<br>
<br>11 address at the ASEM summit in Helsinki, Zapatero took a
<br>more restrained approach and focused not on the United States
<br>but on the global crisis of international terrorism. END NOTE.
<br>
<br>//MIGRATION: NO HELP FROM WEST AFRICA//
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) On illegal immigration, Moratinos expressed great
<br>frustration. He noted that Spain's diplomatic efforts in
<br>West Africa are yielding little tangible results, and he
<br>singled out Senegal in particular as a country that agreed to
<br>cooperate (after a visit by VP Fernandez de la Vega) but has
<br>done little. Ambassador only half-jokingly noted that there
<br>are four warships currently under construction in Spain that
<br>could be used for patrolling the West African coast if the
<br>sale to Venezuela were to be canceled. COMMENT: A recent
<br>poll showed a four percent drop in President Zapatero's
<br>approval rating since July, with illegal immigration as the
<br>leading issue of concern. The Zapatero government appears to
<br>be at somewhat of a loss for how to handle the situation, and
<br>it is having difficulty making the issue a top priority in
<br>the European Union. END COMMENT.
<br>
<br>//BOLIVIA AND CUBA//
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Moratinos opined that Evo Morales was not fully in
<br>charge in Bolivia and that he was saying one thing and doing
<br>another. Moratinos said Spain is having minimal success
<br>establishing credibility and traction with the Morales
<br>government, noting that while Morales has tried to assuage
<br>Spanish concerns about their hydrocarbon interests, people in
<br>his own government do not appear to be under his control.
<br>Moratinos views Bolivian Vice President Alvaro Marcelo Garcia
<br>Linera as the real power in La Paz.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) On Cuba, Moratinos said that Deputy Minister
<br>Bernardino Leon is in Cuba now and could provide Ambassador
<br>with a readout upon his return. Ambassador reminded
<br>Moratinos that the United States is still interested in a
<br>joint statement on Cuba. Moratinos replied that the planned
<br>meeting in New York with A/S Shannon will be a good
<br>opportunity to discuss the situation frankly.
<br>
<br>//FEELING GOOD//
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Moratinos told the Ambassador that he feels very
<br>confident about his position in the GOS and that what he
<br>called recent Spanish foreign policy "successes" have
<br>empowered him to continue pursuing an aggressive agenda. He
<br>also told Ambassador that the recent addition of PSOE foreign
<br>policy advisor Trinidad Jimenez as Secretary of State for
<br>Iberoamerica was not intended to reduce the influence of
<br>current Secretary of State for Foreign Policy Bernardino
<br>Leon. Rather, the move frees up Leon to truly act as a
<br>deputy with oversight throughout the ministry, and Leon will
<br>still hold the Bolivia, Cuba and United States accounts.
<br>During a September 11 telcon, Leon told Ambassador much the
<br>same. Leon said his travel load will likely not change in
<br>the immediate future, though presumably Jimenez will do more
<br>traveling once she is up to speed.
