<br>TAGS: ASEC
<br>SUBJECT: January 2010 Caracas CIWG 
<br>
<br>CLASSIFIED BY: Andres Barcenas, ARSO, Dept. of State, RSO Caracas; 
<br>REASON: 1.4(G) 
<br>
<br>(SBU) On January 5, 2010 Caracas held its bi-annual 
<br>Counterintelligence Working Group (CIWG) meeting to review current 
<br>threat levels and countermeasures, to discuss recent CI activity 
<br>and establish post policy on use of FOBs and Opennet Blackberries. 
<br>In attendance for the meeting were representatives from MSG, POL, 
<br>MGT, RSO, DHS, LEGAT, DEA, CONS, ESO, ECON, DAO/Milgroup, ORA and 
<br>IMO. The DCM chaired the meeting. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>(S/NF) RSO stated the current threat levels for post and stressed 
<br>that Caracas is critical and high in 4 of the 6 threat categories. 
<br>RSO and other sections confirmed that Venezuelan Intelligence 
<br>Services (Directorate of Military Intelligence-DIM and the 
<br>Bolivarian Intelligence Service-SEBIN formerly DISIP) are 
<br>conducting HUMINT and TECH operations against Embassy staff, as 
<br>well as political opposition leaders and are controlled by the 
<br>Cuban Intelligence Service operating in Venezuela. While the 
<br>collection priority appears to be for political opposition leaders, 
<br>RSO reminded everyone that the VIS have the capability, means and 
<br>desire to monitor and target Embassy staff. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>(SBU) During a review of the current threat levels RSO and SEO 
<br>stressed the requirement that locally engaged staff without 
<br>security clearances must be escorted at all times in the CAA. This 
<br>includes the front entrance of the 5th floor area near the 
<br>elevators. LE Staff must not be left unattended in that area. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>(SBU) RSO reminded Section heads when having staff meetings with 
<br>local employees (non-cleared Americans) inside CAA locations the 
<br>Section Head MUST compartmentalize all information and only discuss 
<br>unclassified information in their presence. In addition SEO 
<br>explained the standards for introducing electronic or new items 
<br>into CAA locations and reiterated that no computers or other 
<br>electronic items are allowed in CAA unless they have been sent 
<br>securely to Post through the classified pouch system and controlled 
<br>at all times. Personal items must be screened and tagged by the 
<br>SEO before entering the CAA areas. This standard applies to all 
<br>agencies and staff, PSC or TDY. SEO is working with MGT to send 
<br>out a management notice to all staff reminding them of proper 
<br>procurement procedures for CAA locations. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>(SBU) RSO reiterated to all Section heads the Department policy and 
<br>guidelines for Foreign Contact Reporting and encouraged all Section 
<br>Heads to review the contact reporting policy with all Cleared 
<br>Americans in their sections. In addition RSO reminded staff that 
<br>contact reporting is required for all personal social engagements 
<br>with locally engaged staff from the Embassy. RSO will resubmit the 
<br>Mission Security Notice on Foreign Contact Reporting next week as a 
<br>reminder to all staff. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>(SBU) As part of Post Debriefing Program, RSO expects DS TDY 
<br>support from Washington in March/April to assist with the Annual 
<br>Security Briefings for all Embassy staff. RSO will hold another 
<br>debriefing review this month for all cleared-American staff 
<br>arriving at post over the last 90 to 120 days. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>(S) RSO stressed the need to establish a clear post policy on the 
<br>issuance of FOBs and Opennet Blackberries. IMO stated that 
<br>currently only cleared American staff have been issued FOBs and 
<br>Blackberries, but a few sections have stated the need for a FSN to 
<br>carry Blackberries. It was agreed that the CIWG will review all 
<br>requests for FOBS and Blackberries and will determine if the need 
<br>and stated justification should be approved or denied. The CIWG 
<br>discussed the pros and cons of FOB use within Venezuela and on home 
<br>computers. The CIWG affirmed that FOBs should remain issued only 
<br>to cleared American staff (Further review of the Department 
<br>guidelines and requirements states that based on Caracas' threat 
<br>level cleared American staff must only use the FOBS on computers 
<br>that meet all the Department required security guidelines.) The 
<br>CIWG determined that individuals assigned FOBs should evaluate 
<br>their need and use discretion of the FOB only when the work cannot 
<br>be completed at the Embassy (perhaps only Unclass and not SBU). 
<br>Cleared Americans issued FOBs should receive an additional briefing 
<br>from the ISSO and the RSO to discourage frivolous use of the FOB, 
<br>with a review of what constitutes SBU, especially for non-State 
<br>Agencies.
