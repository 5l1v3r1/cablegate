<br> 
<br>¶1. (S/NF)  Summary:  Interior Minister Jaber Al-Khaled Al 
<br>Sabah told Ambassador February 16 that he is deeply concerned 
<br>about Iranian actions, particularly in Yemen with the 
<br>Houthis.  A security hard-liner whose views do not always 
<br>reflect those of the rest of the GoK, Shaykh Jaber suggested 
<br>Iran is intent upon exporting its revolution and can only be 
<br>deterred by force from achieving its nuclear ambitions; he 
<br>characterized Iran as the "beating heart" of Islamic 
<br>extremism, adding that even Palestinians now aspire to be 
<br>Shi'a because they have bought Iranian "stories" about Shi'a 
<br>being more prepared to "fight to the end" and stand up to 
<br>Israel.  Now Iran is trying to infiltrate Egypt, exploiting 
<br>poverty there.  Ambassador emphasized USG effort to pursue a 
<br>"pressure track" with Iran; on Yemen she suggested many of 
<br>Yemen's problems were home-grown and required economic and 
<br>social solutions at least as much as military ones.  Shaykh 
<br>Jaber concurred, calling President Saleh "a leader with an 
<br>NCO mentality who thinks he can buy loyalty" when what is 
<br>needed is strong, honest government and firmer security 
<br>measures.  Ambassador sought GoK assurances on legality and 
<br>intent to ensure monitoring and withholding of travel 
<br>documents for any future GTMO returnees, noting that without 
<br>those firm commitments the cases of the remaining two 
<br>Kuwaitis in GTMO may prove difficult to resolve.  The 
<br>Minister promised a more formal response but offered his 
<br>personal assurances that travel documents would not be 
<br>issued, and said monitoring of the last two returnees was 
<br>constant and ongoing.  Ambassador also raised the need for 
<br>GoK outreach to the Parliament to prioritize passage of 
<br>pending legislation to criminalize terror financing; Shaykh 
<br>Jaber said politics was hindering progress on this issue and 
<br>on many other important bills, including one to criminalize 
<br>cyber crimes, but said his Ministry was committed to pursuing 
<br>radical extremists and ensuring the safety of Americans in 
<br>Kuwait, with or without new laws.  End Summary. 
<br> 
<br>Iran on my mind 
<br>---------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S/NF)  The blunt and outspoken Minister of Interior, 
<br>Shaykh Jaber Al-Khaled Al Sabah, told Ambassador and DCM 
<br>February 16 that Iran is his major concern.  Iran is intent 
<br>upon exporting its revolution and Shi'ism, has a gameplan, 
<br>and will only be deterred from achieving its objectives - 
<br>including a nuclear weapons capability - by force.  The U.S. 
<br>will not be able to avoid a military conflict with Iran, if 
<br>it is serious in its intention to prevent Tehran from 
<br>achieving a nuclear weapons capability.  In Yemen, the 
<br>Houthis have shown remarkable resilience - where is their 
<br>power coming from?  Yemeni extremists are making money from 
<br>the drug trade, moving narcotics into Saudi Arabia.  The GoK 
<br>has been able to block some of the flow of these drugs from 
<br>Saudi into Kuwait, but remains very concerned about this. 
<br>Iran is involved, clearly, as a producer of drugs and a 
<br>facilitator of transit along the 
<br>Afghanistan-Iran-Somalia-Yemen pipeline.  Now Iran is trying 
<br>to expand its influence in Egypt, seeking to exploit poverty 
<br>there and infiltrate the security services. 
<br> 
<br>Iranian Mythology Resonates 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S/NF)  Shaykh Jaber said that the Sunni-Shi'a balance in 
<br>the region is at risk and chaos could ensue.  Iran is 
<br>"calling the shots" in Iraq, and has so convinced the region 
<br>of its stories - that Shi'a and Iran will "fight to the end" 
<br>where others will not, that only the Shi'a and Iran really 
<br>stand up to Israel - that now many Palestinians want to 
<br>convert to Shi'ism.  As a consequence, Iran has become "the 
<br>beating heart of Islamic extremism."  The Minister apologized 
<br>for speaking so frankly, but said he wanted to clearly convey 
<br>what is of greatest concern to the GoK. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (S/NF) Note: The Interior Minister's concern about Iran 
<br>may have been informed by a couple of recent incidents 
<br>briefed February 17 to the US Navy LNO at the Kuwait Navy 
<br>Base (see IIR septel for details).  In one incident, on 
<br>February 6, IRGC Navy speedboats harassed Kuwaiti fishermen; 
<br>in a more serious incident on February 15 and again on 
<br>February 16, three IRGC Navy speedboats approached a joint 
<br>Kuwait/Saudi oil terminal in international waters (located in 
<br>the Al-Hout field off Mina Az-Zour), approached as close as 
<br>fifty meters and lingered for forty-five minutes on the first 
<br>occasion, but only fifteen minutes the second time (perhaps 
<br> 
<br>KUWAIT 00000142  002 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>as a result of the presence of the Kuwaiti patrol boat 
<br>Istiqlal that was dispatched to the terminal to hold station 
<br>after the first incident).  End Note. 
<br> 
<br>Pressure Track and Yemen Clarification 
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (S/NF)  Ambassador took issue with the Minister's 
<br>characterization of Iran's role in Iraq and then moved to 
<br>review U.S. efforts along the "pressure track" with Iran.  In 
<br>Yemen, Iran may no doubt try to exploit the situation with 
<br>the Houthis, but the causes of the conflict were largely 
<br>internal and would require Yemeni President Saleh to pursue a 
<br>political and social effort as well as a military campaign - 
<br>as was noted in the recent London conference, many of Yemen's 
<br>challenges are ones of governance.  Shaykh Jaber agreed, 
<br>characterizing Saleh as having "an NCO's mentality that you 
<br>can win everything with money" when what is needed is less 
<br>corruption and a more proactive security posture.  The 
<br>Minister noted that Kuwaiti Salafists are sympathetic to the 
<br>cause of the southern secessionists in Yemen and are being 
<br>watched by the GoK; he stated, however, that no Kuwaitis are 
<br>actively involved in the fighting.  Ambassador noted that 
<br>some in the U.S. intelligence community believe that a 
<br>considerable number of Kuwaitis are involved with Al-Qaeda, 
<br>particularly in the AFPAK theater; Shaykh Jaber said Kuwaitis 
<br>tend more to be sympathizers than practitioners, but said 
<br>they all were being watched closely. 
<br> 
<br>GTMO Assurances/Clarifications Needed 
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (S/NF)  The Ambassador raised the issue of the remaining 
<br>two Kuwaiti GTMO detainees, and sought the Minister's 
<br>confirmation that the commitments outlined in the latest 
<br>draft diplomatic note on oversight of returnees - 
<br>particularly with reference to constant monitoring and 
<br>withholding of passports - were both legal and accurately 
<br>reflected GoK intent.  Clarification of the pending 
<br>assurances would likely be necessary given the greater 
<br>seriousness of the cases against the remaining two.  The 
<br>Minister promised a more formal response later, and made 
<br>clear that he could not interfere with the activities of the 
<br>judiciary, but said he was sure the two most recent returnees 
<br>did not have passports, and characterized their level of 
<br>monitoring by the security service as "so close they can 
<br>smell us and feel our breath on the back of their necks." 
<br> 
<br>Need for Passage of AML law 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (S/NF)  The Ambassador - as she had earlier with the 
<br>Foreign Minister (reftel) - noted that Kuwait is now the only 
<br>country on the Arabian Peninsula not to have criminalized 
<br>terror financing.  A pending law is before parliament, but 
<br>Speaker Jassem Al-Khorafi had commented privately to the 
<br>Ambassador that the government had not made its passage a 
<br>priority for the current legislative session.  Shaykh Jaber 
<br>responded that politics was getting in the way of much needed 
<br>legislation, not just TF, but also a bill to define cyber 
<br>crime.  The Minister offered his assurances that the GoK is 
<br>very serious on the matter of terror financing and 
<br>facilitation, with or without the law, and was committed to 
<br>this and to protecting Americans in Kuwait.  At the close of 
<br>the meeting, the Ambassador provided Shaykh Jaber with drop 
<br>copies of two previous requests for information on alleged 
<br>anti-American plotters in Kuwait, acknowledging that these 
<br>could be "poison pen" cases, but requesting a formal response 
<br>from the Ministry to ensure appropriate due diligence had 
<br>been done. 
<br> 
<br>Comment 
<br>-------- 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (S/NF)  Shaykh Jaber survived a no-confidence vote in 
<br>Parliament late last Fall, but the GoK expended only enough 
<br>effort to ensure his victory by a relatively narrow margin. 
<br>The reported cost of that governmental support (arranged by a 
<br>Prime Minister from whom Shaykh Jaber is estranged) was 
<br>Shaykh Jaber's acceptance that KSS Chief 'Athbi Al-Fahad Al 
<br>Sabah would report directly to the PM, not to the Interior 
<br>Minister as has traditionally been the case.  The Interior 
<br>Minister's tough and candid talk on Iran, consequently, while 
<br>it offers useful insight into the private worries likely 
<br>shared by many of Kuwait's seniormost leadership, should not 
<br>necessarily be seen as an articulation likely to result in 
<br>any meaningful GoK policy initiatives.
