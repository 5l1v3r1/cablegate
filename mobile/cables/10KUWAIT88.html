<br> 
<br>Classified By: Political Counselor Pete O'Donohue for reasons 1.4 b and 
<br> d 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) Ambassador, during a January 31 luncheon in honor of 
<br>Tony Blair at the residence of Prime Minister Shaykh Nasser 
<br>Al Sabah, pulled aside Foreign Minister Shaykh Dr. Mohammed 
<br>Al Sabah and raised ref A points concerning Iran's nuclear 
<br>program, continuing USG concerns, and our efforts to address 
<br>Tehran's intransigence, which now require greater application 
<br>of international pressure.  Ambassador also noted Washington 
<br>interest in Kuwait's recent high-level diplomatic engagement 
<br>with Iran (PM's visit in November -- ref B), Iranian 
<br>Parliamentary Speaker Larijani's visit in January (Ref C and 
<br>septel), and reports of a possible Amiri visit later this 
<br>Spring, as well as efforts to expand commercial ties, 
<br>including oil/gas deals on the continental shelf (septel) -- 
<br>and said that enhanced bilateral cooperation to align our 
<br>strategies would be welcome.  The FM took the points on 
<br>board, but declined to be drawn out further on Kuwait's 
<br>strategy for dealing with Iran. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) Earlier at the same event, Ambassador raised reftel 
<br>points with the FM's Office Director, Shaykh Dr. Ahmad Naser 
<br>Al Sabah (Note: also the Prime Minister's son.  End Note), 
<br>who asked whether the Iranian side had committed "in writing" 
<br>to the Tehran reactor fuel swap, the Qom facility inspection 
<br>and the follow-on meeting of P5 1.  Shaykh Dr. Ahmed 
<br>suggested that the two critical issues are whether Iran's 
<br>nuclear program is now so widespread as to be for practical 
<br>purposes unstoppable -- and whether Tehran has or is close to 
<br>having the actual wherewithal to construct a nuclear device. 
<br>Ambassador replied that we are aware of at least three 
<br>reactors, but said the issue of capability was more difficult 
<br>to judge -- technical know-how had to be combined with all 
<br>the various necessary physical components, and there would 
<br>need to be a political decision to proceed.  She emphasized 
<br>that the President's hand is still outstretched to Iran, but 
<br>at some point Iran will have to face the consequences of its 
<br>recalcitrance; moreover, the President was walking a 
<br>carefully considered fine line in dealing with others who 
<br>wished to take actions we hoped to avoid. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) Dr. Ahmad took Ambassador's point and noted that a 
<br>year or two ago, many in Kuwait hoped a silent, targeted 
<br>strike would take out the troublesome reactor and leave the 
<br>region more relaxed.  He suggested that now, however, Iran 
<br>might have multiple reactors and was so intent on achieving 
<br>its nuclear goal that no matter what the West did, Iran would 
<br>get the bomb, and any attempt to disrupt it militarily or 
<br>through tough sanctions would go badly for the West.  He 
<br>offered his analysis that "Iran is very different from Iraq; 
<br>if the "Murshid" orders his people to do something (like 
<br>revenge attacks across the Gulf, striking 
<br>American interests as well as Arab), they will do it, to a 
<br>person." 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) Polcounselor separately alluded to USG concerns raised 
<br>reftel during a January 31 meeting with MFA Asia Department 
<br>Counselor Rashid Al-Hajri during a January read-out on 
<br>Iranian Speaker Ali Larijani's visit last week to Kuwait (Ref 
<br>C and septel).  Al-Hajri, in response, delivered the GoK's 
<br>standard (and not particularly convincing) talking points on 
<br>this issue, emphasizing the GOK's "clear and unchanging 
<br>position" that Iran must abide by UN and IAEA safeguards on 
<br>its nuclear program and opposes any military options in the 
<br>Gulf.  Al-Hajri said GOK officials invariably stress these 
<br>points in meetings with Iranian counterparts; at the same 
<br>time, Kuwait is obliged to conduct bilateral relations on a 
<br>variety of issues with its larger neighbor. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) Comment:  Kuwaitis at all levels are deeply worried 
<br>about the nuclear ambitions of their much larger neighbor, 
<br>but are unsure how to respond.  They worry that an Iran 
<br>emboldened by a nuclear arsenal would assert greater regional 
<br>hegemony at the expense of Kuwaiti interests, and would be 
<br>more inclined to meddle in Kuwaiti internal affairs given the 
<br>thirty percent of the nation that is Shi'a.  However, 
<br>Kuwaitis are equally concerned about military pre-emption, 
<br>which they believe would not prove decisive and would lead 
<br>Iran to lash out at US interests in the Gulf (including US 
<br>military facilities in Kuwait), and against those states in 
<br>the region seen as allied with the US.  Kuwait's current 
<br>limited engagement with Iran appears to be motivated by a 
<br>desire to try to lower regional tensions (particularly 
<br>between Iran and Saudi Arabia), with Kuwait able to distance 
<br> 
<br>itself from the message by emphasizing that it is speaking on 
<br>behalf of the GCC in its capacity as GCC chair for 2010. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (U) Comment continued:  At the same time, Kuwait more 
<br>parochially is seeking a way forward to secure Iranian 
<br>agreement to tap gas reserves in the disputed continental 
<br>shelf (Kuwait needs the gas, which it has little of 
<br>domestically, to fuel more and cleaner power plants to meet 
<br>growing electricity demand).  The careful balancing act 
<br>Kuwait is playing was perhaps best exemplified during the 
<br>visit last week of Iranian parliamentary Speaker Larijani -- 
<br>his warning that GCC states should not allow their territory 
<br>to be used by the US to launch attacks against Iran was 
<br>carried in most local papers on the front page, above the 
<br>fold, with prominent coverage given below the fold to 
<br>comprehensive coverage (including photos) of the US-Kuwait 
<br>military exercise "Eager Mace."  Kuwait's nuanced approach 
<br>requires careful footwork, but PM Nasser Mohammed Al Sabah, 
<br>former dean of Tehran's diplomatic corps and self-described 
<br>Iran expert, apparently feels confident he is up to the task 
<br>-- and doesn't need much help from the US with the 
<br>choreography.  End Comment.
