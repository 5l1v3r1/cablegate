<br>
<br>Classified By: POLITICAL MINISTER COUNSELOR JOSIAH ROSENBLATT, FOR REAS 
<br>ONS 1.4 B/D 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Interior Minister Dominique de Villepin's 
<br>cabinet advisor on the police said March 15 that the French 
<br>security establishment is going through a period of 
<br>"synthesis," in which reforms proposed over the past decades 
<br>are gradually finding their place within standard operating 
<br>procedure. He said France remains as focused "as ever" on 
<br>combating terrorism, but that the latitude offered terrorism 
<br>investigating judges in the 1980s and 1990s may be waning due 
<br>to the country's increasing distance from periods when 
<br>terrorists repeatedly struck on French soil. Regarding 
<br>violence in French society, he said virtually all acts of 
<br>violence and criminality were on the decrease, except for 
<br>troubling increases in the amount of rapes and "gratuitous 
<br>violence." End summary. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) On March 15, Poloff met with Jerome Leonnet, the 
<br>"technical counselor" in Interior Minister Villepin's cabinet 
<br>in charge of "the organization and administration of 
<br>police/terrorism/relations with Renseignements Generaux" 
<br>(France's police intelligence agency). Leonnet has been in 
<br>Villepin's cabinet since summer 2004. He said he previously 
<br>worked for seven years with the DST (France's internal 
<br>security service), seven years with Renseignements Generaux, 
<br>and a number of years with the Prefecture of Police in Paris. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Leonnet described the 1980s and 1990s as decades of 
<br>great turmoil within the security establishment. He said 
<br>that terrorism attacks during that period, especially in 
<br>Paris during the mid-1980s, fed a perception among French 
<br>citizens that the security establishment was relatively 
<br>helpless to stop terrorism. In addition, in the late 1990s, 
<br>France underwent a significant rise in violent crimes, 
<br>something it had not experienced before. In response, the 
<br>GOF instituted a number of different laws, including the 
<br>famous "terrorist conspiracy" law, to give more freedom of 
<br>action to its security services. This period of reform 
<br>lasted through 2004, said Leonnet, with the passage of Perben 
<br>II, an omnibus legal reform bill (reftel). Pointing to two 
<br>thick red books of criminal law on his shelf, Leonnet said 
<br>that France had no more need of new laws; what was needed now 
<br>was bureaucratic implementation, streamlining and 
<br>coordination. Leonnet expected this period of "synthesis" to 
<br>continue for the next few years, with a particular focus on 
<br>training and crisis-response. He also addressed the 
<br>oft-debated idea to combine the DST and RG intelligence 
<br>services. It was a bad idea, said Leonnet, because each 
<br>service had different goals and competencies, and when any 
<br>mixing of dossiers occurred, it was quickly ironed out 
<br>through the interagency process. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Turning to terrorism, Leonnet said he expected that 
<br>getting convictions with the "terrorist conspiracy" charge 
<br>(used to great effect from the 1980s onward) will become more 
<br>difficult for France's terrorism investigating judges. 
<br>Initially, said Leonnet, investigating judges like Jean-Louis 
<br>Bruguiere were given enormous leeway in the conduct of their 
<br>investigations. Standards of proof for "terrorist 
<br>conspiracy" were much lower than standards in other criminal 
<br>cases. However, said Leonnet, the level of evidence required 
<br>for "terrorist conspiracy" convictions is on the increase. 
<br>Terrorism investigating judges will need more evidence than 
<br>was necessary before. Leonnet described this evolution as a 
<br>natural progression away from the reactive policies of the 
<br>1980s and 1990s that takes into account current realities, in 
<br>which the memory of actual terrorist acts has grown distant 
<br>and the demand for civil liberties has become stronger. 
<br>Still, he considered French citizens sensitized to terrorism 
<br>and aware that France remained a prime target for terrorists. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Asked to comment on a newspaper article in early 
<br>February drawing on Renseignement Generaux sources that 
<br>reported Islamist radicals controlled approximately 40 
<br>mosques/prayer halls in France and numbered approximately 500 
<br>militants and 5000 sympathizers, Leonnet said the estimates 
<br>were correct. There had clearly been an increase in radical 
<br>Islam in France over the past few years, said Leonnet. 
<br>Nonetheless, he was optimistic that the long-term trend 
<br>towards radical Islam would begin to decline. Citing efforts 
<br>by the GOF such as ensuring that all imams spoke French, 
<br>close surveillance of mosques and troubled neighborhoods by 
<br>police and security services, the "veil" law, and a 
<br>determination from President Chirac on down to foster 
<br>integration, Leonnet said the GOF was well aware of its 
<br>challenges regarding the spread of radical Islam, and it was 
<br>taking the necessary steps. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) In any case, said Leonnet, the issues of integration 
<br>and immigration had no effect on criminal violence. He said 
<br>that over the past few years, incidents of violence and 
<br>criminality have been on the decrease. Violence perpetrated 
<br>by immigrants usually has a financial or social goal, said 
<br>Leonnet, and those types of crimes have gone down. The two 
<br>exceptions were cases of rape and "gratuitous violence." On 
<br>the increase in rapes, Leonnet speculated that the wide 
<br>diffusion of pornographic films on cable television was an 
<br>important contributing factor. Regarding "gratuitous 
<br>violence," or violence committed with no goal in mind, 
<br>Leonnet said that societal structures that previously weeded 
<br>out and controlled such behavior no longer played the same 
<br>role. Mandatory military service was gone, as was full 
<br>employment and cohesive family structures, all of which 
<br>contributed to identifying individuals with a propensity 
<br>towards gratuitous violent acts.
