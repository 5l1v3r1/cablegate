<br>
<br>-------
<br>SUMMARY
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Your visit to Madrid comes after a difficult year in
<br>our bilateral relationship but also at a time when we are
<br>gradually moving relations to a more positive track. The
<br>Madrid train bombings in March 2004 came as a terrible shock
<br>to a country that felt it was accustomed to dealing with
<br>terrorism (in the form of its 30-year conflict with ETA) and
<br>considered itself a bridge between the Islamic world and the
<br>West. Voters punished the then-ruling Popular Party after
<br>the attacks out of resentment over President Aznar's decision
<br>to ignore strong public opposition to the deployment of
<br>Spanish forces to Iraq, and for the government's mishandling
<br>of the investigation into the train bombings. A year later,
<br>President Zapatero's Socialist Party has consolidated its
<br>control at the national level and the Popular Party remains
<br>very much on the defensive.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) At the international level, Zapatero is working to
<br>repair relations with the USG damaged by Spain's sudden and
<br>poorly coordinated pullout from Iraq and by the Spanish
<br>government's sharp rhetoric against U.S. policy in Iraq.
<br>While the public strongly supported Zapatero's withdrawal of
<br>troops from Iraq, the Socialists' mishandling of relations
<br>with the U.S. exposed the GOS to media and opposition
<br>attacks. We are slowly putting relations back on track,
<br>though differences remain on some issues, such as Spain's
<br>unwillingness to permit the deployment of Spanish NATO
<br>officers to support NATO operations in Iraq. Our objective
<br>is to work with Spain on issues of importance to us and,
<br>where possible, to steer the Zapatero government away from
<br>actions that undermine USG policy objectives. Bilateral
<br>cooperation against terrorism remained strong despite
<br>turbulence in other aspects of the relationship, as did
<br>military to military relations. Spain continues to provide
<br>U.S. forces full access to its naval base at Rota and its air
<br>base at Moron, as well as providing blanket flight clearances
<br>for U.S. forces moving to and from Iraq and Afghanistan.
<br>Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos and Minister
<br>of Defense Jose Bono are scheduled to visit Washington this
<br>spring for meetings with Secretary Rice and Secretary
<br>Rumsfeld, and the Ministers of Interior and Justice are
<br>arranging meetings in Washington as well. End Summary.
<br>
<br>------------------------
<br>A YEAR AFTER THE ATTACKS
<br>------------------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) You arrive in Spain just over a year after the Madrid
<br>train bombings of March 11, 2004 killed 191 people and
<br>wounded over 1600. It was the worst terrorist attack ever in
<br>an EU country and shook a nation that felt it was accustomed
<br>to dealing with terrorism as a result of its 30-year conflict
<br>with ETA. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales's attendance at
<br>the one-year commemoration of the bombings symbolized USG
<br>support for the victims of the attack and our respect for the
<br>Spanish people. Secretary Powell's visit to Spain in the
<br>wake of the 3/11 attacks was appreciated as a positive
<br>gesture, but bilateral friction between the USG and the
<br>Zapatero government since that time has generated a public
<br>perception that the USG is punishing Spain for Zapatero's
<br>actions. Both the USG and the Zapatero government have an
<br>interest in putting relations on a more positive track and
<br>your visit is a signal that despite our differences we value
<br>Spain as an ally.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------
<br>SOCIALISTS IN CONTROL OF NATIONAL GOVERNMENT
<br>--------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) The 3/11 attacks and their aftermath were a turning
<br>point in modern Spanish politics. After taking office in
<br>1996, President Aznar led his center-right Popular Party (PP)
<br>to unprecedented power at the national and regional level.
<br>Although he was not a candidate in 2004, the PP was poised to
<br>win its third national election in a row, despite widespread
<br>dissatisfaction with Aznar's decision to contribute forces to
<br>U.S.-led operations in Iraq. The Madrid train attacks
<br>shocked the Spanish public and triggered an outpouring of
<br>grief and sadness, but then anger when the PP government
<br>continued to blame ETA for the bombings after evidence arose
<br>pointing to Islamic radicals as authors of the attacks. The
<br>bombings allowed the Socialists to capitalize on simmering
<br>resentment of Aznar's decision to send troops to Iraq,
<br>leading to a huge voter turnout and a Socialist victory.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Zapatero moved quickly on his pre-election promise to
<br>withdraw Spanish forces from Iraq, a move widely supported by
<br>the Spanish public. He then pressed forward on a social
<br>agenda that appealed to Spain's center-left electorate (gay
<br>rights, curbing the power of the Catholic Church, better
<br>relations with regional governments in Catalonia and the
<br>Basque Region) further broadening the Socialists' appeal.
<br>Aznar and the PP, meanwhile, remained unapologetic for their
<br>handling of the 3/11 bombings and declined to sideline
<br>leaders discredited by their actions in the wake of the
<br>bombings, further eroding their public support. Zapatero's
<br>main internal challenge is an effort by the Basque Regional
<br>Government (comprised of moderate Basque nationalists opposed
<br>to ETA violence) to increase its autonomy from Spain's
<br>central government. This is a potential powder keg since
<br>most other regions of Spain strongly oppose increasing the
<br>Basque Region's already considerable independence, unless
<br>they too are given greater independence. Zapatero now enjoys
<br>an approval rating of over 60 percent and, barring a major
<br>setback, is likely to remain in power for at least one term
<br>(until 2008). The Socialist Party (PSOE) as a whole also
<br>gets much higher marks today than the PP opposition.
<br>
<br>----------------------------
<br>STRAINED BILATERAL RELATIONS
<br>----------------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) The first eleven months of the Zapatero administration
<br>have proven among the most difficult in recent U.S.-Spanish
<br>history. Throughout the most frustrating episodes, the USG
<br>won points for sticking to the high road and refusing to be
<br>baited into public disputes with the GOS. Despite our
<br>efforts, senior GOS officials continued to make unhelpful
<br>remarks throughout 2004, particularly regarding the U.S. role
<br>in Iraq. Spain has also irritated us by leading an effort to
<br>ease EU pressure on Cuba and engaging the Chavez government
<br>in Venezuela, mainly to satisfy leftist supporters and to
<br>contrast Zapatero's emphasis on "dialogue" with Aznar's
<br>tougher line.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) The turning point in Zapatero's approach to the U.S.
<br>came when former Ambassador Argyros declined to attend
<br>Spain's October 12 national day parade, putting the public
<br>spotlight on our disappointment with the tone and direction
<br>of Spanish foreign policy. This episode undermined Spanish
<br>government assertions in the press that Zapatero's policies
<br>had not strained ties with Washington. This exposed Zapatero
<br>to withering opposition criticism that he had scuttled one of
<br>Spain's most important bilateral relationships and relegated
<br>Spain to second-class status. While polls consistently
<br>demonstrate widespread hostility among Spaniards to USG
<br>foreign policy, the public still expects the GOS to maintain
<br>healthy working relations with the U.S. Zapatero has
<br>responded accordingly and has initiated moves to repair ties
<br>with the USG.
<br>
<br>------------------------
<br>RECENT POSITIVE GESTURES
<br>------------------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Since November, Spanish officials at all levels have
<br>made clear their desire to restore strong bilateral ties,
<br>with the Foreign Ministry's Director General for Foreign
<br>Policy (under secretary equivalent) telling us bluntly, "We
<br>want back in." In response, we've told our Spanish contacts
<br>that we are prepared to move forward on issues of bilateral
<br>importance and that unambiguous, positive steps by Spain
<br>would be the best signal to the USG that they too were ready
<br>to move forward. Spain subsequently agreed to USG requests
<br>that it lead a Provincial Reconstruction Team and a Forward
<br>Support Base in western Afghanistan as part of NATO's mission
<br>in that country, issued positive statements regarding the
<br>Iraq elections, and contributed $20 million to the Iraq
<br>elections fund. Spain also continues to disburse $300
<br>million in assistance to Iraq pledged during the 2003 Iraq
<br>Donors Conference in Madrid, and has agreed to train Iraqi
<br>security forces in Spain. We expect Foreign Minister
<br>Moratinos to highlight these moves during his April 15
<br>meeting with Secretary Rice.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) The USG has welcomed these steps, while making clear
<br>that we remain troubled by mixed signals from Spain, such as
<br>continued characterizations of the conflict in Iraq as "an
<br>illegal war" by senior Spanish officials. Separately, we
<br>want Spain to lift its caveats on the deployment of Spanish
<br>NATO officers to participate in NATO missions, including in
<br>Iraq. Also, Zapatero is negotiating to sell naval vessels to
<br>Venezuela to support Spain's troubled shipbuilding industry
<br>and Spain continues to press for closer EU ties with Castro.
<br>Despite these differences, we believe relations are moving in
<br>a positive direction and we want to move ahead in our
<br>significant bilateral agenda with Spain.
<br>
<br>-----------------------------
<br>COUNTER-TERRORISM COOPERATION
<br>-----------------------------
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) A critical element in our bilateral relationship is
<br>our high level of cooperation on law enforcement and
<br>counter-terrorism issues. Spain remains an active front in
<br>the War on Terror. Investigations since the 3/11 attack have
<br>confirmed suspicions that there is a large pool of Islamic
<br>extremists throughout the country, including one cell that
<br>plotted attacks against Spain's High Court and other targets
<br>during the latter half of 2004. ETA also continues to carry
<br>out small-scale bombings, though it has been greatly weakened
<br>in the last year by arrests of key leaders in Spain and
<br>France. Spanish authorities arrested 117 suspected Islamic
<br>terrorists during the year, routinely sharing with USG
<br>officials information derived from those arrests. A DOJ team
<br>met with Spanish counterparts in December to identify
<br>mechanisms for improving information sharing and judicial
<br>cooperation, particularly on counter-terrorism
<br>investigations. Attorney General Gonzales and Minister of
<br>Justice Aguilar issued a joint statement on March 11, 2005
<br>committing the USG and GOS to closer cooperation on
<br>counter-terrorism investigations. Aguilar and Minister of
<br>Interior Jose Antonio Alonso had excellent meetings with
<br>Attorney General Gonzales. Alonso will travel to Washington
<br>April 18 and Aguilar will visit May 5.
<br>
<br>--------------------
<br>MILITARY COOPERATION
<br>--------------------
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Military to military relations remain very strong
<br>despite the change in government; the Zapatero government has
<br>continued to provide broad access for U.S. forces to Rota
<br>Naval Base (on Spain's southern coast) and Moron Air Base
<br>(southwest Spain). There are currently over 2500 active duty
<br>U.S. military stationed at the two bases, the vast majority
<br>at Rota. The American presence at the bases tops 5,000 when
<br>U.S. civilians and dependents are included. Zapatero has
<br>also left untouched Spain's practice of providing blanket
<br>flight clearances for U.S. military aircraft, including in
<br>support of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Spanish
<br>military is still smarting from its ignominious withdrawal
<br>from Iraq and, largely as a result of the Iraq withdrawal, is
<br>very unhappy with the Socialist government. The Spanish
<br>armed forces strongly support close relations with the U.S.
<br>and consider Zapatero's distancing from the U.S. a profound
<br>error. Minister of Defense Bono will meet with Secretary
<br>Rumsfeld May 3 in Washington.
<br>
<br>-------------------
<br>BROADER MIDDLE EAST
<br>-------------------
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) The Zapatero government may tell you it has much to
<br>offer in finding solutions to the issues that face the
<br>Broader Middle East because of Spain's proximity to the area
<br>and its experience with Islamic immigrants. FM Moratinos in
<br>particular touts his experience as the EU's Middle East
<br>envoy. The Spanish speak frequently of the 10-year
<br>commemoration of the EU's Barcelona Process, which will be
<br>held in Barcelona this October. In his speech at the 2004
<br>UNGA, Zapatero announced a concept he called "The Alliance of
<br>Civilizations," a sketchy plan dealing with relations between
<br>the Islamic world and the West that remains very much
<br>undefined. We have told the Zapatero government that while
<br>we look forward to learning more about the Alliance of
<br>Civilizations, it is important that proposals for greater
<br>understanding and spreading democracy in the region are
<br>consistent with other initiatives, such as the G-8's Broader
<br>Middle East and North Africa Initiative.
<br>
<br>---------------------------------
<br>ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL RELATIONS
<br>---------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) We have important commercial interests in Spain as
<br>well, with a business community that is staunchly supportive
<br>of U.S. investment and concerned that Zapatero's policies
<br>will lead to a decrease in U.S. business involvement. At
<br>every opportunity, we work to encourage a business-friendly
<br>environment in Spain.
<br>
<br>¶14. (U) The GOS cooperates with the U.S. on terrorism finance
<br>issues. Working-level contacts have repeatedly sought
<br>information on pre-notifications. The GOS checks for assets
<br>upon receiving information from us, but to date has not found
<br>such assets. The Interior Ministry is working on
<br>implementing regulations to a terrorism finance law that will
<br>enhance the government,s ability to freeze assets.
<br>
<br>¶15. (U) Spain is an Airbus stakeholder. Recently, Iberia
<br>chose Airbus to replace a number of medium-sized jets despite
<br>extensive lobbying by the Embassy on Boeing,s behalf. With
<br>respect to the Airbus-Boeing subsidies dispute, Spanish
<br>interlocutors indicate that Spain lets the Commission
<br>formulate policy. Spain was pleased that the rice issue was
<br>recently satisfactorily resolved as the retaliation
<br>contemplated by the U.S. would have struck Spanish olive,
<br>clementine, and saffron exports particularly hard. Spain
<br>voted in favor of extending the reprieve on implementing the
<br>EU,s wood packing directive.
<br>
<br>¶16. (U) Spain is not on the Special 301 list. However, we
<br>are working to improve respect for IPR in Spain. The GOS has
<br>agreed to participate in a U.S.-Spain IPR roundtable
<br>scheduled for the end of June or September. Commerce
<br>Assistant Secretary Lash will lead the U.S. delegation at
<br>this event. We are also working on agricultural
<br>biotechnology issues in Spain. The previous government was
<br>largely positive with respect to the technology. The current
<br>government,s environment minister is opposed. In particular,
<br>we are seeking to obtain approval for Monsanto's NK 603
<br>variety, favorable Spanish votes on Commission proposals for
<br>biotechnology approvals (the Zapatero government has
<br>abstained on four important votes) and a rational
<br>co-existence decree.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---------
<br>YOUR VISIT WILL HELP KEEP RELATIONS ON POSITIVE COURSE
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---------
<br>
<br>¶17. (C) The USG will not re-establish with Zapatero the deep
<br>and close relationship we had with the Aznar administration.
<br>However, we are currently moving towards a more productive
<br>course that achieves USG interests in Spain and in other
<br>regions. Your visit will help us emphasize to the Zapatero
<br>government and the Spanish people that despite our
<br>differences with the Zapatero administration, we continue to
<br>consider Spain a close and important ally and, provided Spain
<br>works with us, we can move ahead together on robust bilateral
<br>and multilateral agendas.
