<br>
<br>Classified By: Political Minister-Counselor Kathleen Allegrone for reas 
<br>ons 1.4 (B & D). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: On August 21, French Elysee Advisor Boris 
<br>Boillon and MFA A/S for Eurasia Roland Galharague, who 
<br>traveled with FM Kouchner to the region, provided us with a 
<br>consistent interpretation of the arrival of OSCE monitors: 
<br>the new monitors are responding to the emergency situation; 
<br>they are not the new international mechanism referred to in 
<br>point 5 and do not prejudge the eventual international 
<br>arrangements. Galharague welcomed reftel demarche. Pol M-C 
<br>emphasized the need for Russia to respect its commitments to 
<br>retreat, and encouraged active consideration of what will 
<br>happen on August 22 if Russian forces have not fully 
<br>withdrawn. Post will remain seized of these and related 
<br>questions in the days to come. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) On August 21, French Elysee Advisor Boris Boillon 
<br>(Middle East advisor with acting responsibility for this 
<br>portfolio) explained that the arrival of the OSCE monitors in 
<br>the coming days are part of the security measures mentioned 
<br>in point 5 of the six point document, but only in the sense 
<br>of meeting the immediate emergency. The 500 Russians who 
<br>will continue their patrols will be in contact with (work 
<br>with) the OSCE monitors and others, undefined, in the zone. 
<br>But this is just a preliminary measure to meet the urgent 
<br>conditions. There still needs to be an international 
<br>discussion to find an international mechanism to put in 
<br>place. Until then, these other temporary measures will be 
<br>needed to meet the emergency. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Later on August 21, MFA A/S-equivalent for Eurasia 
<br>and the Balkans Roland Galharague described the coming days 
<br>as critical and decisive for the situation in Georgia as well 
<br>as relations with Russia. Whether this crisis is a "one-off" 
<br>for Russia or the beginning of a new dynamic is not yet fully 
<br>clear. France's current goal is to advance the political 
<br>process for implementation of the Sarkozy-brokered six-point 
<br>plan. He said that beyond a long-term stop to hostilities 
<br>and a Russian retreat, the key priority is establishing 
<br>international arrangements as soon as possible to deny Russia 
<br>a pretext for maintaining its presence in Georgia. 
<br>Galharague stated that the EU GAERC conclusions created a 
<br>mandate to pursue a UN Security Council Resolution, but that 
<br>France is further motivated to pursue one due to the belief 
<br>that it would create the best basis for protecting Georgian 
<br>interests. In order to implement point 5 of the cease-fire, 
<br>one and only one "international mechanism" is needed, and one 
<br>to which Russia is not a third party. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Galharague said the French Mission to the UN is 
<br>working on a revised draft UNSCR today that would cite in 
<br>extenso the six-point plan and refer to an international 
<br>mechanism. To establish more clarity on the ground in 
<br>Georgia as quickly as possible, existing mandates such as the 
<br>OSCE monitoring one should be taken advantage of, and can be 
<br>followed by missions that first require new mandates. Both 
<br>our current ground information and the signs coming from the 
<br>Russian government are contradictory and often unverifiable. 
<br>It is not clear whether they are taking steps to withdraw by 
<br>the 22nd. He said the primary European and Allied interest 
<br>is to establish a new international dynamic permitting the 
<br>rest of the international community to regain some control 
<br>over Russia's actions. He said France had not established 
<br>any concrete benchmarks for Russia's retreat from Georgia, in 
<br>the belief that more flexibility meant more opportunity to 
<br>exert political pressure on Russia. He noted that Russia's 
<br>goal would be to consolidate their positions while changing 
<br>their force posture to "peacekeeping" mode. Regarding 
<br>France's definition of point 5, he referred us to President 
<br>Sarkozy's letter stating that while awaiting an international 
<br>mechanism, Russian forces can remain in the immediate 
<br>proximity of South Ossetia. He reiterated the need for a 
<br>UNSCR, this time to replace the 1992 cease-fire agreement 
<br>(and a 1999 understanding) that Russia currently uses as its 
<br>point of reference for "500 troops" and to give the 
<br>international community more flexibility. He pointed out 
<br>that the same 1990,s agreements posit a similar number of 
<br>Georgian and South Ossetian patrols, and noted that,s 
<br>obviously a mandate Georgia can,t fulfill now and another 
<br>reason to supercede it. He said that a strengthened OSCE 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00001616 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>monitoring mission would be due to urgency only, and would 
<br>not prejudge the political process or the eventual 
<br>international arrangements for long-term resolution. 
<br>COMMENT: Galharague's interpretation was fully consistent 
<br>with what we heard from Boillon shortly beforehand. END 
<br>COMMENT. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Regarding the EU's role, Galharague said that whether 
<br>a European Council might be convened would depend on 
<br>developments. He said there was more consensus than expected 
<br>at the GAERC, as France had not planned to issue conclusions. 
<br>He said the EU has a consistent objective to gain more 
<br>control of Russia's actions in the international arena, and 
<br>that that shared basis for action would remain unanimous. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Galharague hypothesized that Russia's strategy for 
<br>Georgia was to produce "Kosovo in reverse," only accelerated, 
<br>with Saakashvili in the role of Milosevic, Russia in the role 
<br>of NATO, etc. However, he said it was too early to speculate 
<br>about whether the crisis in Georgia was just "tit for tat" 
<br>for Kosovo. He said in his view, Russia viewed the situation 
<br>as a "win-win" - regardless of the outcome of the status of 
<br>South Ossetia and Abkhazia, Russia has had its revenge for 
<br>Kosovo. He noted that Russia will have more presence and 
<br>operate "more easily" in a more tense international climate. 
<br>Galharague welcomed reftel demarche, while expressing 
<br>interest in further information regarding U.S. strategy in 
<br>the crisis, including at the UN. Pol M-C emphasized the need 
<br>for Russia to respect its commitments to retreat, and 
<br>encouraged active consideration of what will happen on August 
<br>22 if Russian forces have not fully withdrawn.
