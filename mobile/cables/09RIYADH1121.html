<br>SUMMARY AND COMMENT 
<br>-------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (C) In the aftermath of the failed assassination attempt 
<br>targeting Assistant Interior Minister Prince Mohammed bin 
<br>Naif (MbN) (ref A), King Abdullah and other officials 
<br>responded swiftly and decisively to reassure the public that 
<br>the Prince was well, and reaffirm the Kingdom's commitment to 
<br>combating terrorism.  The press and the public universally 
<br>condemned the attack, characterizing it as a direct assault 
<br>against the Saudi state and Islam.  A more measured reaction 
<br>in the blogosphere hints at how this most recent incident 
<br>might affect domestic debate on the proper approach to 
<br>dealing with domestic terrorism, with some calling for 
<br>continued leniency and emphasis on reform and others arguing 
<br>the Saudi government is being too lax.  The attack seems to 
<br>have strengthened the already positive public reputation of 
<br>Prince Mohammed bin Naif, and many religious-minded Saudis 
<br>will see his miraculous survival, almost unscathed, as a sign 
<br>of Divine protection and blessing for his efforts against 
<br>Al-Qaeda and other extremists.  For his part, Prince Mohammed 
<br>has told us the attack has only strengthened his resolve, and 
<br>convinced him that the Kingdom's counter-terrorism strategy, 
<br>combining firmness with understanding, is effective and 
<br>should continue.  End Summary and Comment. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>OFFICIAL REACTION SWIFT AND DECISIVE 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (U) Official condemnation came from all quarters 
<br>immediately following the attack.  The Saudi Press Agency 
<br>published photographs of King Abdullah and MbN, wearing a 
<br>bandage on his left middle finger, meeting at the hospital in 
<br>Jeddah.  News channel Al-Arabiya played a tape of the visit 
<br>throughout the day in which the visibly concerned King 
<br>praised Allah for the Prince's safety and described the 
<br>attack as an attack against both Islam and the country: 
<br>"Thanks be to God that you are safe and nothing has happened 
<br>to you.  Everything you might have suffered in the service of 
<br>your religion and homeland will not be for nothing, God 
<br>willing."  MbN responded that this attack "would only 
<br>strengthen our resolve to root out the terrorists," and 
<br>admitted that he was at fault for failing to require a full 
<br>search of the bomber.  Official reports note that the 
<br>would-be assassin was on a list of 85 wanted terrorists, that 
<br>MbN was aware of his planned attendance, and that he had been 
<br>expected to turn himself in at the event. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (U) Other prominent religious and political figures were 
<br>widely quoted in the press the day after the incident.  The 
<br>Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia told Okaz newspaper the attack 
<br>was "not unexpected," and called the assailant "deviant" and 
<br>"corrupt to the core."  Justice Minister Mohammed Al-Issa 
<br>"thanked Allah" for keeping the Prince safe.  Interior 
<br>Ministry Spokesman Major General Mansour Al-Turki reaffirmed 
<br>the Ministry's commitment to fighting terrorism, 
<br>characterizing the attack as "an isolated incident" and 
<br>adding "those who think the war on terror is over in the 
<br>Kingdom are mistaken." 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>PRINCE FETED IN PAPERS, PUBLIC SHOCKED BY ATTACK 
<br>--------------------------------------------- --- 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (U) All major Arabic and English dailies led with the 
<br>story, focusing prominently on MbN himself and his role in 
<br>the Kingdom's war on terror.  Al-Sharq Al-Awsat dedicated the 
<br>first three pages of the August 29 edition solely to the 
<br>attack on the Prince and related subjects.  Other papers 
<br>included lengthy biographical profiles of the Prince, 
<br>editorial cartoons dealing with the event, and even poems in 
<br>his honor. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (U) The articles and editorials show broad support for 
<br>MbN and, more generally, the fight against terrorism.  Many 
<br>depicted the event as an assault on the Saudi state that 
<br>called for a patriotic response.  Saudi journalist Dawood 
<br>Al-Shiryan wrote in Al-Hayat that the attack was "terrorism 
<br>as a political rebellion attempting to undermine the 
<br>authority of the state."  Okaz called the attack "an attack 
<br>on the security of the nation...that should make everyone 
<br>alert and ready to fight."  The August 29 editorial cartoon 
<br>in Al-Watan depicted a prone terrorist, wearing an explosive 
<br>belt and holding a detonator in each hand, dead and bleeding 
<br> 
<br>RIYADH 00001121  002 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>from a wound caused by the Saudi flag planted in his back. 
<br>In the same paper, a caricature accompanying a poem 
<br>celebrating the Prince as "Engineer of Love and War" shows 
<br>him carrying a shield resembling the Saudi flag. 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (U) The public's reaction as portrayed in an Arab News 
<br>article was of "shock, disgust, and dismay," noting that the 
<br>timing of the attack during the holy month of Ramadan was a 
<br>particular source of ire.  One student in Jeddah said "Yes, 
<br>there is frustration among a section of people regarding our 
<br>foreign policy, but what happened...is deplorable and utterly 
<br>un-Islamic."  A Riyadh-based professional questioned whether 
<br>the Kingdom should continue with its rehabilitation programs, 
<br>saying these efforts had been "nullified" by the attack and 
<br>that the perpetrator had "betrayed our leaders."  Others 
<br>called the attack "evidence that the government's anti-terror 
<br>tactics have been largely successful," and observed "panic in 
<br>the terror camp" and "frustration with the government's 
<br>continued success of hitting (terrorists) hard." 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>DIVERSE REACTION IN THE BLOGOSPHERE 
<br>----------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (U) On his Saudi Jeans blog, Ahmed Al-Omran expressed 
<br>relief that the Prince was not seriously injured and hope 
<br>that the incident would not "add fuel to the fire" of the 
<br>debate between liberals and conservatives.  He added, "this 
<br>is a time for solidarity and national unity, let us not ruin 
<br>it."  A contributor to blog Al-Saha encouraged MbN to 
<br>continue to demonstrate openness and patience with 
<br>terrorists, not revert to iron-fisted policies.  An informal 
<br>poll on the same website indicated strong support for the 
<br>Prince, with 58% of voters suggesting MbN should replace his 
<br>father as Interior Minister.  Liberal blog Al-Tomaar said the 
<br>attack was the result of "spoiling terrorists and treating 
<br>them leniently," referring to the SAG's widely-touted 
<br>terrorist rehabilitation scheme (ref B). 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>CONTACTS RESERVE COMMENT 
<br>------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (C) Post contacts were reluctant to comment substantively 
<br>on the attack over the phone, telling us that it was common 
<br>for royals to welcome well-wishers during Ramadan, that they 
<br>were relieved MbN was not injured, and that they wondered why 
<br>the man was not checked.  When the subject was broached at a 
<br>meeting between PAS officers and Deputy Minister of Higher 
<br>Education Mohammed Alohali on August 29, however, he went 
<br>somewhat beyond the fulsome praise of MbN as "Qahir al 
<br>Erhaby" (conqueror of terrorism) that is the stuff of most 
<br>media commentary.  "We know what we,re up against," said 
<br>Alohali, adding that dangerous extremists were still a threat 
<br>to the country.  This, he said, was the reason the SAG was 
<br>pushing educational reform so hard. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>TERROR, YEMEN ALREADY HOT TOPICS 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (U) Saudi soul-searching about the root causes and extent 
<br>of domestic terrorism has been evident since 2003, and the 
<br>August 20 announcement that 44 suspected Al-Qaeda militants 
<br>had been arrested in the Kingdom injected it with new vigor. 
<br>On August 22, Al-Sharq Al-Awsat columnist Husayn Al-Shubakshi 
<br>praised the Saudi security forces for their "pre-emptive, 
<br>focused, professional, and secret blows," and credited MbN 
<br>directly for the Ministry's success. 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (U) In an August 27 piece in the same paper, columnist 
<br>Mshari Al-Zaydi also considered the arrests a success, while 
<br>citing the need to confront terrorism as an ideological 
<br>issue.  That this new batch of terrorists was predominantly 
<br>Saudi, middle-aged, and well-educated challenged previous 
<br>assumptions that economic deprivation and youthful religious 
<br>zealotry were responsible for domestic terrorism, and 
<br>indicated that the government needed to rethink its approach. 
<br> "Saudi Arabia is now confronting a new virus that is 
<br>constantly evolving," he writes, adding "the ideological 
<br>doctor who is holding on to the surgeon's scalpel...is yet to 
<br>enter the operating theater." 
<br> 
<br>¶11.  (C) Although unvoiced in the gushing media paeans to 
<br>MbN, ordinary Saudis are wondering how this assassination 
<br>attempt came so close to fruition.  According to today,s 
<br>edition of "Okaz," the suspect managed to make his way from 
<br>Yemen into Saudi Arabia some weeks ago, and finally rented a 
<br>furnished apartment in Jeddah.  We anticipate that such 
<br>reports will inevitably spur some introspection into how well 
<br>the security services are patrolling the Asir region.
