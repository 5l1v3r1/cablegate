<br>TAGS: EFIN EINV KTFN PREL AF
<br>SUBJECT: FOLLOW-UP REQUEST -- RESOURCING EFFORTS TO DISMANTLE THE NEW
<br>ANSARI HAWALA NETWORK AND OTHER ILLICIT FINANCING THREATS
<br>
<br>REF: KABUL 2791
<br>
<br>Classified By: CDDEA Ambassador E. Anthony Wayne for reasons 1.4 (b)
<br>and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) As discussed in reftel, information strongly suggests
<br>Afghanistan's New Ansari hawala network is facilitating bribes and
<br>other wide-scale illicit cash transfers for corrupt Afghan officials
<br>and is providing illicit financial services for narco-traffickers,
<br>insurgents, and criminals through an array of front companies in
<br>Afghanistan and the UAE.
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) Headquartered in Kabul, the New Ansari hawala network has
<br>connections to Dubai and other global financial markets.  Law
<br>enforcement and other components in Mission Afghanistan and ISAF have
<br>been investigating New Ansari and briefed Washington agencies in a
<br>September 8 SVTC.  As noted in ref, moving forward against New Ansari
<br>requires an interagency approach here in country as well as in
<br>Washington.  Such efforts will need to include better organizing and
<br>resourcing USG efforts to identify and disrupt financial linkages in
<br>Afghanistan and in key regional financial hubs.
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) Embassy would appreciate a response to the requests for
<br>additional resources/support contained in reftel.  These include the
<br>need to fully staff the Afghan Threat Finance Cell (ATFC) -- the
<br>total number of positions required is 49, but only 22 of those
<br>positions are filled.  Moreover, a higher percentage of those slots
<br>should be filled with more senior and experienced interagency
<br>analysts and at least one public corruption prosecutor.  The ATFC
<br>also urgently requires access to translators who can accurately and
<br>quickly process an increasing amount of wire intercept information,
<br>including complex technical and financial records.  In addition, the
<br>current split in the ATFC between Bagram Airfield and Kabul should be
<br>minimized.  To integrate the ATFC better into broader intelligence
<br>analysis efforts, it would be advisable to establish a lead base of
<br>operations in Kabul.  The ATFC would continue to forward deploy
<br>liaison staff at each regional command to ensure country-wide
<br>coverage.
<br>
<br>¶4.  (C) Mission appreciates Washington agencies' consideration and
<br>support of these requests.  We look forward to a rapid response.
