<br>REF: A. MEXICO 3076 
<br>¶B. MEXICO 2154 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Charge d' Affaires John Feeley. 
<br>Reason: 1.4 (b),(d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) Summary. Defense Secretary Galvan raised recently 
<br>the possibility of invoking Article 29 of the constitution to 
<br>declare a state of exception in certain areas of the country 
<br>that would provide more solid legal grounds for the 
<br>military's role in the domestic counternarcotics (CN) fight. 
<br>Secretary of Government Gomez Mont has alternately provided a 
<br>different view, citing a Supreme Court decision as sufficient 
<br>precedent for providing the military the legal basis for its 
<br>domestic CN activities. Our analysis suggests that the legal 
<br>benefits to invoking a state of exception are uncertain at 
<br>best, and the political costs appear high. While the 
<br>possibility of such a declaration cannot be discounted at 
<br>some future date, the GOM seems far from settled on the 
<br>efficacy or need for such an immediate move. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>Background and Context 
<br>---------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) In an October 19 meeting with Director for 
<br>National Intelligence Dennis Blair (ref a), Secretary of 
<br>Defense (SEDENA) General Guillermo Galvan Galvan lamented the 
<br>lack of legal basis for the military's domestic 
<br>counternarcotics deployment as key to shaping the public's 
<br>perception that the Armed Forces lack the appropriate 
<br>authorities to conduct such operations. He noted that SEDENA 
<br>is working to pass the National Security law (ref b), 
<br>proposed by President Calderon in the final days of the last 
<br>congressional session, to help shore up these legal 
<br>foundations. Additionally, he mentioned that Article 29 of 
<br>the Mexican constitution would permit the President to 
<br>declare a state of exception in specific areas of crisis and 
<br>give the military greater juridical scope to maneuver. In a 
<br>later meeting, Secretary of Government Fernando Francisco 
<br>Gomez Mont responded to questions by U.S. officials on the 
<br>Article 29 issue. He contradicted Galvan's view that the 
<br>military does not have legal basis for its domestic CN 
<br>activities and cited a Supreme Court decision as having 
<br>already set precedent (Note: Gomez Mont is almost certainly 
<br>referring to a 1996 Supreme Court decision that ruled the 
<br>military has the authority to operate at the request of local 
<br>authorities in support of policing operations. End note.) He 
<br>implied that the invocation of Article 29 does not have the 
<br>legal urgency or necessity Galvan suggested, but did admit 
<br>that the state of exception in places such as Ciudad Juarez 
<br>"had been discussed." He said that no decision had been 
<br>reached. 
<br>
<br>Article 29 Text 
<br>--------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) The translated text of Article 29 of the 
<br>constitution reads: "In the event of invasion, serious 
<br>disturbance, or any other event which may place society in 
<br>great danger or conflict, only the President of the Mexican 
<br>Republic, with the consent of the Council of Ministers and 
<br>with the approval of the Federal Congress, and during 
<br>adjournments of the latter, of the Permanent Committee, may 
<br>suspend throughout the country or in a determined place the 
<br>guarantees which present an obstacle to a rapid and ready 
<br>combating of the situation; but he must do so for a limited 
<br>time, by means of general preventive measures without such 
<br>suspensions being limited to a specified individual. If the 
<br>suspension should occur while the Congress is in session, the 
<br>latter shall grant such authorizations that it deems 
<br>necessary to enable the Executive to meet the situation. If 
<br>the suspension occurs during a period of adjournment, the 
<br>Congress shall be convoked without delay in order to grant 
<br>them." 
<br>
<br>What Would Article 29 Look Like? 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) The terms of the state of exception detailed in 
<br>Article 29 are vague and offer little insight into how its 
<br>
<br>MEXICO 00003101 002 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>invocation would play out on the ground. There appears to be 
<br>a great deal of leeway for the President -- with the approval 
<br>of Congress -- to determine what kinds of guarantees to 
<br>suspend given the nature of the emergency at hand. To paint 
<br>a scenario: the GOM could elect to apply the article in a 
<br>zone of perceived crisis, such as Ciudad Juarez, for the 
<br>period of one year. The decree could potentially suspend 
<br>rights guaranteed in the first chapter of the constitution, 
<br>including freedom of expression, freedom of press, freedom of 
<br>assembly, freedom of passage, or some tenets of legal due 
<br>process. The military, for example, might be granted broader 
<br>detention authorities. The law does not explicitly call for 
<br>greater military involvement, and Gomez Mont told US 
<br>officials that it is not martial law "in the way that you 
<br>know it." Galvan's interest in the state of exception 
<br>suggests two possibilities: that he envisions a potentially 
<br>broader role for the military (at the expense, perhaps, of 
<br>cooperation with other insitutions), or that he is seeking a 
<br>stronger legal framework and additional legal protections to 
<br>back up the military's current domestic operations. Calderon 
<br>has already put the military in charge of municipal police in 
<br>Ciudad Juarez and other areas in Chihuahua State. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) The discussion of Article 29's application is 
<br>highly theoretical. Gomez Mont, when asked whether a state 
<br>of exception would imply the federalization of municipal 
<br>authorities, acknowledged a "constitutional gray area." He 
<br>admitted that municipal governments could "be limited," but 
<br>said that Mexico's signature to the UN Human Rights Charter 
<br>limits how far the GOM could go in suspending rights. 
<br>
<br>The Limits 
<br>---------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) The GOM does not take lightly its use of Article 29. 
<br>The GOM has not, in fact, invoked it since when it declared 
<br>war on Italy, Germany, and Japan during World War II. The 
<br>GOM has even abstained from employing the measure during 
<br>times of cataclysmic internal strife such as the 1968 student 
<br>protests, the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, the 1990s fight 
<br>against armed uprisings in Chiapas, or the 2006 Oaxaca 
<br>protests. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) The GOM's hesitation so far to invoke the article is 
<br>due to a number of factors, which are particularly relevant 
<br>given the democratic context in which Mexico now operates. 
<br>Perhaps most critical, the article clearly stipulates that 
<br>Congress -- meaning both Chambers -- must approve the measure 
<br>and its various permissions, circumvention of rights, 
<br>geographic application, and time frame, suggesting that the 
<br>President's ability to achieve a state of exception under his 
<br>terms would be uncertain, at best. Such a move would not be 
<br>seen solely as a law enforcement procedure but as a carefully 
<br>calculated move with significant political implications. 
<br>President Calderon lacks an absolute majority in either the 
<br>Chamber of Deputies or the Senate, and it is unlikely that 
<br>his opponents would approve carte blanche significantly 
<br>expanded authorities for the military or federal government. 
<br>Indeed, Calderon instead might run the risk of having his 
<br>hands tied by Congress, depending on the vote and final 
<br>details of how Article 29 would be invoked. For example, the 
<br>legislature might vote to allow the federal government to 
<br>declare a limited state of exception in a crisis zone for a 
<br>short period of time, asking that Calderon then return to 
<br>Congress to renew the mandate. This would give Congress at 
<br>least nominal oversight over the military's counternarcotics 
<br>operations, a role it has sought but not had up to this 
<br>point. Congress could also reject wholesale the article's 
<br>invocation, which would be an embarrassing public blow to the 
<br>GOM. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Moreover, Calderon is negotiating with Congress on 
<br>other legislation that will better serve his counternarcotics 
<br>goals. Proposed in late April, reforms to the National 
<br>Security Act would provide a firmer legal framework for the 
<br>military's domestic counterdrug fight, give the President the 
<br>power to declare a threat to domestic security and deploy the 
<br>military without congressional approval. It would also 
<br>provide the military with greater intelligence authorities 
<br>and powers over the state and local forces in the area. 
<br>
<br>MEXICO 00003101 003 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) contacts have 
<br>indicated that they would prefer to limit presidential 
<br>authority than expand it, and PRD Senator and member of the 
<br>Justice Committee, Tomas Torres, has told Poloff that the 
<br>reform as written is unlikely to pass. Nevertheless, such 
<br>legislation permanently codifying the military's role and the 
<br>President's authority to deploy it would certainly be of 
<br>greater use to Calderon than would be a watered down state of 
<br>exception. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (S/NF) Gomez Mont told U.S. officials during the October 
<br>19 exchange that the invocation of Article 29 would be 
<br>"highly controversial," and downplayed its immediate 
<br>necessity. The public relations cost of declaring a state of 
<br>exception in places like Ciudad Juarez would likely be high, 
<br>and almost certainly would draw increased scrutiny from the 
<br>international and domestic human rights community. Moreover, 
<br>a defeat by Congress of an Article 29 proposal would be seen 
<br>as a public rejection of Calderon's counternarcotics strategy. 
<br>
<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Benefits to an Article 29 strategy would be limited. 
<br>If written correctly and approved by Congress, it could give 
<br>the military a temporary legal cover for its activities and 
<br>perhaps allow it to focus more on operations and less on its 
<br>critics. Notable Mexico legal experts have envisioned the 
<br>employment of Article 29 only in the case of a "firestorm," 
<br>such as local or state governments rejecting military 
<br>assistance in areas where the GOM sees it as badly needed. 
<br>Galvan's views are more reflective of the military's desire 
<br>for legal protections on human rights and other grounds, than 
<br>of any imminent legal or political challenges to the 
<br>military's current domestic counternarcotics role. Clearly, 
<br>Calderon is looking for new tools with which to fight 
<br>increased levels of violence in places like Ciudad Juarez, 
<br>but any benefits he would gain with an Article 29 state of 
<br>exception would be undermined by the high political costs of 
<br>such an approach. With questionable support in Congress and 
<br>limited political capital, he would put at risk popular and 
<br>congressional support that has given the military broad room 
<br>to maneuver in the current legal framework. While the 
<br>possibility of the declaration of a state of exception cannot 
<br>be discounted at some future date, the GOM seems far from 
<br>settled on the efficacy or need for such an immediate move.
