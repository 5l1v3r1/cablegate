<br>
<br>SUMMARY 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) While there is no open diplomacy being conducted, it 
<br>appears the Saudis and the Houthis may be seeking to 
<br>disengage from their fighting. Prince Khalid's announcement 
<br>on December 23 that major military operations had ended was 
<br>followed by a Houthi statement that offered withdrawal from 
<br>all positions on the border in return for a cessation of 
<br>Saudi attacks. Saudi Land Forces have reportedly ceased 
<br>offensive activities, although significant Saudi air strikes 
<br>and artillery shelling have continued. It may be that the 
<br>Saudis are now starting to turn the fight over to Yemeni 
<br>government forces; Yemeni military sources reported today 
<br>that they launched several attacks on Houthi positions on 
<br>December 28 (Reuters, 12/29). End summary. 
<br>
<br>SHRINKING MEDIA COVERAGE 
<br>------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Reporting in national Saudi media about the Houthi 
<br>fighting has decreased substantially in recent days, with 
<br>news about Yemen focusing mostly on the attacks against 
<br>Al-Qaida targets. Saudi media reports from the battlefront 
<br>say that the Saudi military continues "clearing operations" 
<br>and air strikes while insisting that these operations have 
<br>not and will not cross into Yemeni territory. Houthi-sourced 
<br>reports claim daily air attacks by Saudi and U.S. aircraft. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) After Prince Khalid's 12/23 announcement of Saudi 
<br>casualties and his 48-hour ultimatum for the Houthis to 
<br>withdraw from Al-Jabri, the Houthis released an official 
<br>statement to Al-Quds Al-Arabi. Muhammad Abd-al-Salam, 
<br>official spokesman for the Houthis, said: "There is no 
<br>objection to our withdrawal from the positions in Saudi 
<br>Arabia on the condition that the Saudis stop the aggression 
<br>and not allow the use of their territories against us. ... 
<br>The crux of the problem with the Saudi regime is not the 
<br>territory or the border but because we faced Yemeni 
<br>aggression from its territories." 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) This possible olive branch offered by the Houthis was 
<br>apparently not accepted by the Saudis, as the next day the 
<br>Saudi newspaper Al-Yawm reported that Saudi tanks, heavy 
<br>artillery and planes "pounded the stronghold of the 
<br>infiltrators fortified in Al-Jabri inflicting heavy losses 
<br>including the deaths of 340 infiltrators and the destruction 
<br>of the deserted houses where the enemies were taking refuge." 
<br>The actual number of Houthi deaths has not been confirmed, 
<br>but both Al-Riyadh and Al-Watan reported on 12/28 that the 
<br>village of Al-Jabri was recaptured by Saudi forces. For 
<br>their part, the Houthis say there were 31 air strikes on 
<br>Al-Jabri. 
<br>
<br>PRINCE KHALID'S REPUTATION: 
<br>ANOTHER CASUALTY OF THE WAR? 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Embassy contacts in the Saudi Ministry of Defense 
<br>suggest that the Saudi Land Forces have largely ended 
<br>offensive actions since Dec, 23 when Prince Khalid declared 
<br>victory and an end to the main Saudi military campaign. 
<br>Prince Khalid's decision to stop ground operations probably 
<br>means that the Saudi military has been able to clear the 
<br>border area of Houthi insurgents. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) We have also heard that Prince Khalid was pressed 
<br>to stand down the ground forces because of King Abdullah's 
<br>growing ire over three particular issues: 1) why it has taken 
<br>so long to expel the ragtag Houthi fighters, 2) how there 
<br>
<br>RIYADH 00001687 002.2 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>could be so many Saudi casualties, and 3) why the Saudi 
<br>military has not proven more capable, given the billions 
<br>invested in modernization over recent decades. Some military 
<br>officers have speculated that Prince Khalid may have been 
<br>removed from his position by the King if not for the return 
<br>and protection of his father Prince Sultan. At minimum, 
<br>within the Saudi leadership Prince Khalid's reputation as a 
<br>military leader appears to have been damaged, perhaps ruling 
<br>him out as an eventual successor to his father as Defense 
<br>Minister. 
<br>
<br>COMMENT - FINGER-POINTING TIME APPROACHES 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) For the last two months, the Saudi military has 
<br>employed massively disproportionate force in its effort to 
<br>repel and clear the lightly armed Houthi guerillas from the 
<br>border area. Day and night aerial bombardment and artillery 
<br>shelling have been the main instruments of what is 
<br>increasingly regarded within the Saudi military as an 
<br>embarrassingly long campaign that was poorly planned and 
<br>executed that brought unexpectedly high Saudi casualties 
<br>(exact number not known - officially 73 deaths), many 
<br>apparently from friendly fire. Nonetheless, the conflict has 
<br>been carefully spun as a heroic and successful struggle to 
<br>protect Saudi sovereignty. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) During the campaign, the Saudi military turned to the 
<br>U.S. for emergency provision of munitions, imagery and 
<br>intelligence to assist them to operate with greater 
<br>precision. The U.S. military responded with alacrity to the 
<br>extent possible, primarily by flying in stocks of ammunition 
<br>for small weapons and artillery. However, the great majority 
<br>of Saudi requests remain bogged down in the FMS contacting 
<br>process or in interagency reviews. Prince Khalid and several 
<br>senior Saudi Air Force officers have complained that the U.S. 
<br>has not rallied to support Saudi Arabia during its hour of 
<br>greatest need. As the Saudi military services seek to divert 
<br>blame for the poor management of the Houthi operations in the 
<br>weeks ahead, it can be expected that such criticism of U.S. 
<br>support will continue, if not sharpen.
