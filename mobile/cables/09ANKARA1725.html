<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary. During an October 19-20 visit to Ankara,
<br>Treasury Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing and
<br>Financial Crimes David Cohen cautioned government and banking
<br>officials about doing business with Iranian banks. GOT
<br>officials insisted they will comply with all UNSC
<br>obligations, but are unwilling unilaterally to sever trade
<br>with their neighbor Iran. A/S Cohen also discussed a pending
<br>review of Turkey by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).
<br>Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek said he has created a task
<br>force to consider broadening Turkey's narrow definition of
<br>terrorism, but cautioned that the parliament would not be
<br>able to consider new legislation until it completes budget
<br>deliberations in December. A/S Cohen expressed appreciation
<br>for the creation of the task force, but emphasized that only
<br>actions completed before February 2010 would be factored into
<br>the FATF report. GOT officials expressed appreciation for
<br>the USG's designation of three PKK terrorist financiers.
<br>Treasury's delegation also included Senior Advisor Elizabeth
<br>Rosenberg and Policy Advisor Christopher Burdick. End
<br>summary.
<br>
<br>First Opening on Amending the Definition of Terrorism
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) On October 19, A/S Cohen met with Finance Minister
<br>Simsek and representatives of the Financial Crimes
<br>Investigation Board (MASAK). Simsek began the meeting by
<br>commending the USG's decision to name three PKK terrorist
<br>financiers to the list of significant narcotics traffickers.
<br>A/S Cohen and Simsek discussed the FATF's decision to
<br>undertake a "targeted review" of Turkey that will consider
<br>Turkey's compliance with the FATF's Anti-Money Laundering and
<br>Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) standards.
<br>The G-20 Leaders have given the FATF a firm deadline of
<br>February 2010 for reporting on this stage of the review
<br>process.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) A/S Cohen explained the work of the FATF's
<br>International Cooperation Review Group (ICRG). In April
<br>2009, G-20 Leaders tasked the FATF to assess jurisdictions'
<br>compliance with internationally-agreed standards on AML/CFT
<br>and name jurisdictions that do not have adequate
<br>jurisdictions. After preliminary assessments, Turkey is
<br>being considered for failure properly to implement an AML/CFT
<br>regime that meets international standards. A/S Cohen
<br>detailed the timeline for the FATF review: by mid-November
<br>the GOT will receive a draft "targeted review" paper
<br>describing Turkey's key strategic deficiencies written by an
<br>unnamed member of the FATF. In December, Turkey will meet
<br>with the ICRG's Europe and Eurasian Regional Review Group in
<br>Strasbourg to discuss the paper and the action plan proposed
<br>by the review group. In mid-February, the FATF plenary will
<br>assess Turkey's key strategic AML/CFT deficiencies and any
<br>progress on addressing them. At that time, the FATF will
<br>decide whether Turkey's AML/CFT deficiencies represent a
<br>threat to the international financial system and should be
<br>publicly identified. Simsek said Turkey would cooperate
<br>fully with the process and would continue its reform efforts,
<br>but cautioned that the parliament will be fully occupied with
<br>review of the Turkish budget until late December and would
<br>not have time or manpower available until then to work
<br>closely on terrorism financing.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Simsek said Turkey was one of the first countries to
<br>adopt an Anti-Terror Law and, as a long-time victim of
<br>domestic and international terror attacks, Turkey recognizes
<br>the importance of having the right framework in place to deal
<br>with terror. Simsek said Turkey does not, in practice, have
<br>a narrow view of terrorism and would not ignore terror
<br>attacks against foreign entities or businesses in Turkey and
<br>would treat perpetrators severely. A/S Cohen noted the need
<br>to amend Turkey's narrow legal definition of terrorism, which
<br>covers only attacks against the Turkish state or Turkish
<br>national interests, in order to be compliant with
<br>international standards. Simsek advised that he has named a
<br>task force with representatives from the Prime Ministry,
<br>Foreign, Finance, and Justice Ministries, chaired by MASAK to
<br>prepare a report on Turkey's definition of terrorism and
<br>action against terrorist financing. The report will be given
<br>to the respective ministers, who will decide whether a change
<br>is possible. A/S Cohen expressed appreciation for the
<br>creation of the task force, but emphasized that only actions
<br>completed before February 2010 would be factored in to the
<br>
<br>FATF's decision.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Cohen expressed concern about delays in Turkey's
<br>compliance with the UNSC 1267 and 1373 designation process
<br>and the low level of money laundering or terror finance
<br>prosecutions. A/S Cohen noted Turkey's progress on reforming
<br>its customer due diligence, but said Turkey must strengthen
<br>its efforts to fight terrorism finance.
<br>
<br>Turkey Must Do Business with Neighbor Iran
<br>------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (S) A/S Cohen made Reftel D points on Iran's efforts to
<br>circumvent UNSC and international sanctions with Turkish
<br>financial institutions to Simsek, MASAK, xxxxxxxxxxxx, and the Banking
<br>Regulation and Supervision Agency in separate meetings.
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) A/S Cohen reminded Simsek of FATF's repeated warnings
<br>about doing business with Iranian banks and individuals.
<br>Simsek was aware of these warnings and said Turkey would
<br>uphold international law and comply with all UN Security
<br>Council Resolutions. He said Turkish financial institutions
<br>would continue to apply extreme due diligence and special
<br>vigilance when dealing with Iran, but noted that Turkey has
<br>the geographic reality of a long border and trading history
<br>with Iran. He noted this trade must be financed on an
<br>ongoing basis and insisted the U.S. must keep this in mind.
<br>Simsek said Turkey would welcome any specific intelligence
<br>the USG can share about Iranian entities supporting
<br>terrorism. In response to downgraded intelligence
<br>information on Iranian mis-use of the Turkish financial
<br>system that A/S Cohen passed, Simsek noted Turkey wants all
<br>its neighbors to be free of nuclear weapons. Simsek pledged
<br>to instruct Turkish financial institutions to increase
<br>vigilance against Iranians who might use deceptive methods to
<br>circumvent international sanctions.
<br>
<br>¶8. (S) On October 20, xxxxxxxxxxxx also expressed
<br>appreciation for the USG's "courageous" designation of the
<br>three PKK terrorist financiers and the hope that Turkey's
<br>European partners will follow the U.S. example. He said
<br>terrorists are not using weapons or components made or sold
<br>in Turkey; instead, they are buying 90 percent of these
<br>products from the EU. xxxxxxxxxxxx said pressure should be
<br>brought against the EU to stop selling arms to Iran, rather
<br>than just asking Turkey to stop the flow after the weapons
<br>are sold.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx noted that Turkey has been suffering from
<br>terrorism for decades and had an Anti-Terror Law in place
<br>before the September 11, 2001 terror attacks. He mentioned
<br>the 2006 law criminalizing money laundering and GOT efforts
<br>to enhance customer due diligence and suspicious transaction
<br>reporting regimes. xxxxxxxxxxxx noted that Turkey follows
<br>both domestic law and sanctions under its international
<br>obligations when fighting terror finance, including the UN's
<br>Terrorism Finance Convention, UNSCR 1267 and 1373, and the
<br>Counter Terrorism Committee, which Turkey will chair in 2010.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx said Turkey enforces all UNSCR sanctions
<br>against Iran, despite a shared border and an
<br>admittedly-difficult history, but cannot do anything beyond
<br>UNSCRs and existing law. He added his hope that Europe will
<br>follow the USG's PKK designation example and noted that the
<br>EU could and should do more against terrorist financing.
<br>
<br>Aid to Gaza
<br>-----------
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) On Gaza, xxxxxxxxxxxx said Turkey's interest is in
<br>providing humanitarian assistance to Gaza directly without
<br>providing support to Hamas. A/S Cohen encouraged the GOT and
<br>private Turks to use UN mechanisms to give aid in ways that
<br>keep money out of Hamas's hands. He said "we sympathize with
<br>the needs of people in Gaza" and will send money directly to
<br>the people and work to "convince our Israeli friends to send
<br>help also." xxxxxxxxxxxx noted that the Israeli Government
<br>has prohibited the movement of aid to Gaza. A/S Cohen raised
<br>concerns about IHH, the Turkish Humanitarian Relief
<br>Foundation, which was a large NGO providing material
<br>assistance to Hamas. (See Reftel C.) xxxxxxxxxxxx said he
<br>was not familiar with the NGO but would look into the matter.
<br>
<br>
<br>Halkbank Cautious on Trade Finance with Iran
<br>--------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶12. (S) A/S Cohen met with xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx to discuss concerns about Halkbank's involvement with
<br>Iran and possible Iranian efforts to circumvent sanctions by
<br>disguising the real origins and sources of transactions.
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx said Halkbank complies with all UN sanctions and will
<br>remain alert and extra vigilant against these efforts. He
<br>noted that Halkbank has a representative office in Tehran,
<br>left over from its 2004 merger with Pamuk Bank. He noted
<br>that after the 2004 merger, Halkbank ended its correspondent
<br>banking relationship, but not its business development,
<br>maintaining a representative in Tehran. He acknowledged
<br>Halkbank has a long-inactive correspondent account with Bank
<br>Sepah, which it can close. xxxxxxxxxxxx emphasized that Halkbank
<br>provides financial services and products for trade, but does
<br>not undertake third party or transit transactions. All of
<br>its trade finance is done on a documentary basis with strict
<br>customs controls and inspections. He added that no deals are
<br>financed on a cash-for-goods basis. xxxxxxxxxxxx said Turkey has
<br>"many millions of Euros" in trade with Iran, but apart from
<br>oil purchases, the total is only 10-15 million Euro. A/S
<br>Cohen warned that the USG has evidence of Iran falsifying
<br>documents to push through transactions. xxxxxxxxxxxx said
<br>they would remain vigilant and would welcome any specific
<br>details.
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx noted that 25 percent of Halkbank's equity
<br>floats on the Istanbul Stock Exchange and 90 percent of that
<br>total is foreign owned. He said Halkbank is careful to
<br>consult and be alert to all names on the Office of Foreign
<br>Assets Control list and all circulars and information from
<br>MASAK. A/S Cohen discussed the need to broaden the Turkish
<br>definition of terrorism and further criminalize terrorist
<br>financing. The Halkbank officials agreed and said the AKP
<br>has the votes needed to push this through the parliament.
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx asked A/S Cohen how the USG's relationship with Iran
<br>will develop over time. A/S Cohen responded that the USG
<br>wants to work with the international community to prevent
<br>Iran from developing nuclear weapons. We want to keep
<br>communication lines open but also to hold Iran to UNSC
<br>sanctions and obligations, he added. Halkbank closed by
<br>noting that there was a sensitive balance that Turkey had to
<br>play, noting the large numbers of unemployed youth in Iran
<br>and the need for Turkey to offer legitimate help to the
<br>Iranian economy.
<br>
<br>¶14. (SBU) A/S Cohen met with representatives of the Banking
<br>Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA) to discuss points
<br>mentioned above. BRSA noted Turkey's progress in complying
<br>with FATF regulations and efforts to expand that work. They
<br>outlined the bank examination and auditing process and the
<br>collection of data on all banks in Turkey. The officials
<br>made note of all A/S Cohen's points and pledged to share the
<br>information with xxxxxxxxxxxx. In response
<br>to specific instances of illicit Iranian activities, the BRSA
<br>officials pledged to pass this information to the BRSA's
<br>Enforcement Division and reply with any information that they
<br>found. Regarding the activities of Bank Mellat, BRSA
<br>officials noted that the bank has a negligible share of the
<br>banking sector. Mellat conducts mainly trade transactions
<br>through its Turkish branches, and the bank is audited four
<br>times per year by external auditors.
<br>
<br>¶15. (U) A/S Cohen has cleared on this report.
