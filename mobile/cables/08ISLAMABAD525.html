<br>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR CJCS ADMIRAL MULLEN 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Anne W. Patterson, for reasons 1.4 (b)(d) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) Summary. We look forward to your visit to begin the 
<br>process of strengthening and refocusing our military to 
<br>military relations with Pakistan's CJCS General Majid and 
<br>COAS Kayani. This has become increasingly urgent because of 
<br>the expanding insurgency in the tribal areas and attacks 
<br>against GOP targets. We need to bring more discipline to the 
<br>Coalition Support Funds (CSF), FMF and IMET programs we 
<br>established in the wake of September 11 so they better 
<br>support our counter-terrorism objectives. You may wish to 
<br>follow up on the visit of the DNI and the DCIA to push 
<br>Musharraf and Kayani on our objectives, including pressing 
<br>all of them on expanded U.S. training and mil-mil and 
<br>intelligence cooperation If you can set the scene for needed 
<br>reforms, we can follow up during the annual bilateral 
<br>Consultative Defense Group meeting in the spring. Although 
<br>they are concerned about the 2009 expiration of the 
<br>President's financial commitment to Pakistan, the military is 
<br>reluctant to make necessary reforms. Your visit will help 
<br>change their attitude. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) At the same time, I would like to discuss with you 
<br>the assignment of more American officers in ODRP. We cannot 
<br>have more effective military to military relations until we 
<br>have more American officers on the ground. It will still be 
<br>a long and painful struggle to improve relations, but the 
<br>presence of more American officers is a minimal condition. 
<br>End Summary. 
<br>
<br>Political Uncertainty 
<br>--------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) A year ago, Musharraf's popularity was high; we were 
<br>working together to support a smooth transition to a civilian 
<br>government. Beginning with his decision to fire the Chief 
<br>Justice in March 2007, Musharraf has made repeated political 
<br>blunders culminating in a state of emergency (SOE) and 
<br>temporary suspension of the constitution. He is increasingly 
<br>isolated after firing long-time advisors who disagreed with 
<br>some of these decisions. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) The February 18 elections are too close to call. No 
<br>party will win enough votes to form a government alone, and 
<br>the current game is one of coalition building. Musharraf's 
<br>party remains well organized in the critical Punjab, but the 
<br>state of emergency, Bhutto's assassination, rising food 
<br>prices and electricity outages have cut his job approval 
<br>rating to 15% in the latest polls. Most analysts predict a 
<br>surge in sympathy votes for Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party 
<br>(PPP), but security concerns and a PPP leadership struggle 
<br>could reduce turnout and undercut this surge. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) If street expectations for a PPP victory are 
<br>disappointed, many are predicting violence, especially in 
<br>Bhutto's home province of Sindh. We can work with any of the 
<br>likely candidates for Prime Minister. But it may take weeks 
<br>or even months after the election before a new Prime Minister 
<br>is chosen and Pakistan again has a functional government that 
<br>can focus on tackling extremism and necessary economic 
<br>reform. 
<br>
<br>Security Concerns/Army Challenges 
<br>--------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) The January/February bombings in Lahore, Karachi, 
<br>Peshawar and Rawalpindi have further raised security 
<br>concerns, especially for political candidates. Suicide 
<br>bombings were practically unheard of in Pakistan two years 
<br>ago; in 2007, over 600 people died in suicide attacks 
<br>attributed to Baitullah Mehsud and other militants. 
<br>Militants have become increasingly emboldened, attacking 
<br>police, Army and intelligence targets. The Army was called 
<br>out to provide additional security during the Islamic month 
<br>of Muharram and will be deployed in sensitive polling areas 
<br>during the elections. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Neither the Army nor the security services would 
<br>relish the prospect of adding post-election riot control in 
<br>Sindh to their currently full plate. Military operations in 
<br>Swat have been reasonably successful, but the Army will 
<br>likely have to maintain a significant presence there into the 
<br>spring. In the Federally Administered Tribal Area (FATA), 
<br>the Army has been working to prevent Sunni-Shia' violence, 
<br>exacerbated this year by militant involvement. In the 
<br>Waziristans, the government is encouraging rival tribes to 
<br>counter the influence of Baitullah Mehsud and his Uzbek 
<br>recruits. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) The militants continue to control the agenda; the 
<br>Army's currently limited strategy is one of containment 
<br>rather than pro-active engagement. Since they cannot defeat 
<br>
<br>ISLAMABAD 00000525 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>Mehsud with military action alone, they are renewing 
<br>negotiations, hoping this time to deal from a greater ground 
<br>position of strength. Attacks on the Pak-Afghan border are 
<br>significantly lower than they have been in the past two 
<br>years, but we are seeing signs that militants are moving back 
<br>into Afghanistan ahead of the annual spring offensive. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) We are making progress on the Security Development 
<br>Plan (SDP) for the Frontier Corps, although Musharraf may 
<br>complain about aid levels. Progress on the tripartite Border 
<br>Coordination Centers (BCC) has not been quick enough. We 
<br>will brief you on our FATA development strategy and how the 
<br>SDP supports livelihood and other programs now being 
<br>implemented in FATA. 
<br>
<br>Nuclear Weapons 
<br>--------------- 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Pakistan's leadership is increasingly frustrated 
<br>over media reports that its nuclear weapons are about to fall 
<br>into extremist hands. In January, both the Foreign Secretary 
<br>and General Majid called me in to protest U.S. reports 
<br>questioning the security of the GOP's nuclear weapons. You 
<br>will meet with the Director of the Special Plans Division 
<br>LtGen (ret) Kidwai who, at the Embassy's urging, recently 
<br>provided briefings to the diplomatic corps and the 
<br>international press on the organizational structure and 
<br>personnel controls that safeguard Pakistan's nuclear weapons. 
<br>As demonstrated by the February 1 test of its Ghauri/Hatf V 
<br>missile, Pakistan continues development of its missile and 
<br>nuclear programs as a deterrent to India's conventional force 
<br>capability. 
<br>
<br>Meeting Agendas 
<br>--------------- 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Separately, we are providing briefing papers 
<br>covering our proposals to bring better discipline to CSF, 
<br>regularize FMF based on a mutual needs assessment, increase 
<br>IMET opportunities, and launch SOFA negotiations and MOA 
<br>talks on improving transshipment of fuel and cargo to support 
<br>U.S. forces in Afghanistan. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) General Majid: You will find Pakistan's Joint 
<br>Staff a young and weak organization, but CJCS Majid is an 
<br>excellent interlocutor. The lunch he is hosting will provide 
<br>an opportunity to deliver our messages on the need for CSF 
<br>and FMF discipline. 
<br>
<br>¶13. (S) General Kayani: As expected, Kayani is taking slow 
<br>but deliberate steps to distance the Army from now civilian 
<br>President Musharraf. Kayani announced that generals would 
<br>need his permission to meet the President, issued public 
<br>statements distancing the Army from civilian politics and is 
<br>rumored to be considering a decision to remove active duty 
<br>Army officers from civilian GOP jobs. Kayani also has 
<br>declared 2008 as the "Year of the Soldier" in an attempt to 
<br>improve morale. Privately, he has discouraged ISI 
<br>interference in elections. With Kayani, you should stress 
<br>the importance of accepting U.S. COIN training and building 
<br>Pakistani CI capabilities. 
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) President Musharraf: You will find Musharraf 
<br>increasingly defensive and unsure of how to reverse his 
<br>growing unpopularity ahead of parliamentary elections. In 
<br>your meeting, I would recommend that you ask him to appoint a 
<br>Pakistani "czar" to coordinate security and development 
<br>projects in the tribal areas. This coordination will be 
<br>critical in implementing the USG's $750 million FATA program 
<br>and supporting DOD's strategy in the tribal areas. Musharraf 
<br>and Kayani will likely raise slow CSF reimbursement because 
<br>an economic cash crunch has heightened the GOP's need for CSF 
<br>payments. The latest $282 million payment should be released 
<br>in mid-February. He will raise slow delivery of training and 
<br>equipment to the Frontier Corps. You will want to follow up 
<br>on some of the specific issues raised by the DNI and the DCIA.<br>
