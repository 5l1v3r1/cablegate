<br>SUBJECT: TURKMENISTAN/IRAN: WEAPONS FOUND HIDDEN IN IRANIAN 
<br>EMBASSY SHIPMENT 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Charge Richard Miles, reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (S/NF)  A Turkmen customs official told an Embassy LES on 
<br>February 13 that an Iranian Embassy diplomatic container with 
<br>AK-47's, sniper rifles and ammunition hidden in it had been 
<br>discovered one week earlier at the Serdar Uli (Gaudan) 
<br>customs point in Ashgabat, where vehicles and containers 
<br>arriving from or bound for Iran are inspected.  The weapons 
<br>were reportedly hidden underneath two Turkmen carpets that 
<br>the Iranian Embassy was shipping to Iran. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S/NF) The LES went to the Ashgabat Customs Point (a 
<br>different location) to inquire about an Embassy pouch 
<br>shipment arriving by truck, and an issue arose about opening 
<br>the Embassy's container for inspection.  The customs 
<br>official, who is a close friend of LES, then brought up the 
<br>Iranian container incident.  He said that a local shipping 
<br>employee of the Iranian Embassy had been present when another 
<br>official, acting on a "hunch that something was not right," 
<br>opened the Iranian Embassy container.  The customs official 
<br>told LES that the official who discovered the cache was 
<br>honored for his actions and received a promotion. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S/NF) COMMENT:  Turkmenistan imposes stringent controls 
<br>on the importation of any type of firearm, and Chiefs of 
<br>Missions' security detail are all unarmed.  Even assuming 
<br>that the weapons in question were intended for the Iranian 
<br>Embassy's internal security, this would not explain the 
<br>presence of offensive weapons such as sniper rifles, in the 
<br>cache.  The Embassy has no official confirmation about the 
<br>incident, which was, we note, relayed second-hand to our LES. 
<br> END COMMENT.
