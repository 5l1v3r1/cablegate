<br>reasons 1.4(b) and (d).
<br>
<br>-------
<br>SUMMARY
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) The Zapatero government believes it has taken
<br>significant steps to put relations with the U.S. back on
<br>track, such as agreeing to lead both a PRT and an FSB in
<br>western Afghanistan. Military-to-military relations between
<br>Spain and the U.S. have remained strong over the past 14
<br>months despite the change in government, as has bilateral
<br>cooperation against terrorism. Spain continues to provide
<br>U.S. forces full access to its naval base at Rota and its air
<br>base at Moron, as well as providing blanket flight clearances
<br>for U.S. forces moving to and from Iraq and Afghanistan.
<br>Defense Minister Bono will acknowledge that the U.S. and
<br>Spain still have differences over issues such as Venezuela
<br>but will ask that the U.S. focus on areas of cooperation, and
<br>not only on areas of disagreement. Your meeting with Bono
<br>can be an opportunity to send a clear message to the Spanish
<br>government that while the U.S. appreciates Spain's
<br>cooperation in Afghanistan and other areas, the U.S. remains
<br>concerned about Spanish actions that negatively affect our
<br>interests, such as Zapatero's Venezuela policy. End Summary.
<br>
<br>--------------------
<br>MILITARY COOPERATION
<br>--------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Military to military relations between Spain and the
<br>U.S. remain very strong despite the change to a Socialist
<br>government; the Zapatero government has continued to provide
<br>broad access for U.S. forces at Rota Naval Base and Moron Air
<br>Base. There are currently over 2500 active duty U.S.
<br>military stationed at the two bases, the vast majority at
<br>Rota. Including U.S. civilians and dependents, the American
<br>presence at the Spanish bases tops 5,000. Zapatero has also
<br>left untouched Spain's practice of providing blanket flight
<br>clearances for U.S. military aircraft, including in support
<br>of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Spanish military
<br>is still smarting from its ignominious withdrawal from Iraq
<br>and, largely as a result of the Iraq withdrawal, is
<br>displeased with the Socialist government. The Spanish armed
<br>forces strongly support close relations with the U.S. and
<br>consider Zapatero's distancing from the U.S. a profound
<br>error.
<br>
<br>-----------------------------
<br>COUNTER-TERRORISM COOPERATION
<br>-----------------------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) A critical element in our bilateral relationship is
<br>our high level of cooperation on law enforcement and
<br>counter-terrorism issues. Spain remains an active front in
<br>the War on Terror. Investigations since the 3/11 attack have
<br>confirmed suspicions that there is a large pool of Islamic
<br>extremists throughout the country, including one cell that
<br>plotted attacks against Spain's High Court and other targets
<br>during the latter half of 2004. ETA also continues to carry
<br>out small-scale bombings, though it has been greatly weakened
<br>in the last year by arrests of key leaders in Spain and
<br>France. Spanish authorities arrested 117 suspected Islamic
<br>terrorists during 2004, routinely sharing with USG officials
<br>information derived from those arrests. Attorney General
<br>Gonzales and Minister of Justice Aguilar issued a joint
<br>statement on March 11, 2005 committing the USG and GOS to
<br>closer cooperation on counter-terrorism investigations.
<br>
<br>-----------------------------
<br>ISSUES BONO WILL LIKELY RAISE
<br>-----------------------------
<br>
<br>Venezuela
<br>---------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) While he hopes Venezuela will not be the focus of
<br>your meeting with him, Bono will come prepared to discuss
<br>Spain's outreach to Venezuela, including its planned sale of
<br>military ships and planes. Bono has told us the reason Spain
<br>is selling the ships to Venezuela is to save ailing
<br>state-owned shipyard Izar (reftel). This is probably partly
<br>true -- it is also clear President Zapatero believes he can
<br>influence Chavez and restrain his anti-democratic tendencies
<br>by engaging him. Nonetheless, Bono will point out that the
<br>sale amounts to USD 1.7 billion in equipment and will provide
<br>Izar with 600 jobs over a 4-5 year period. He will also
<br>insist that neither the ships nor the planes will have
<br>offensive capability, and that Chavez has agreed not to use
<br>the equipment for offensive purposes.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Embassy and other USG officials have made clear many
<br>times to high-level GOS officials (including to President
<br>Zapatero himself by Deputy Secretary of State Zoellick) that
<br>the U.S. believes the sale would bolster Chavez' military
<br>capabilities and thus his capacity to cause instability in
<br>the region, and would also lend him political credibility
<br>when he is taking steps to curb democracy in his own country.
<br>In addition, we have told Spanish officials that given that
<br>Spain-U.S. relations were slowly improving, now was not the
<br>time to make a major military sale to Venezuela.
<br>
<br>
<br>S-80 Submarine Program
<br>----------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) The Spanish Navy plans to procure 4 new diesel
<br>submarines of Spanish design, called the S-80A. Izar will be
<br>the prime contractor for the vessel's construction. Izar has
<br>put out for competition a contract to assist in the building
<br>of the sub's combat system. Two American companies, Raytheon
<br>and Lockheed Martin, are competing with each other and
<br>against a French and German company for the $115 million
<br>deal. The Spanish government has been mulling the
<br>competitors' submissions for nearly a year and has yet to
<br>reach a decision. The Spanish Navy has made clear its
<br>support for a U.S. solution for the combat system, arguing a
<br>U.S. system will provide critical interoperability with the
<br>U.S. Navy. The Zapatero government, however, has told us
<br>they have received significant pressure from the French
<br>government to award the contract to the French competitor.
<br>Embassy has advocated tirelessly on behalf of the U.S.
<br>companies.
<br>
<br>
<br>Tomahawk Missile
<br>----------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Bono has said that if the U.S. government releases
<br>the Tomahawk missile to Spain, Spain will purchase the
<br>missile. We understand the release of the missile has
<br>cleared a number of hurdles in Washington. He may well
<br>express the Spanish government's interest in purchasing the
<br>Tomahawk missile to you and his hope that the release will be
<br>approved.
<br>
<br>-------------------------------------
<br>BACKGROUND: SOCIALISTS REMAIN POPULAR
<br>-------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) One year after taking over the presidency, President
<br>Zapatero enjoys an approval rating of over 60 percent and,
<br>barring a major setback, is likely to remain in power for at
<br>least one term (until 2008). The Socialist Party (PSOE) as a
<br>whole also gets much higher marks today than the PP
<br>opposition. Zapatero's withdrawal of Spanish troops from
<br>Iraq was wildly popular with the Spanish public and the
<br>social agenda he has pushed appeals to Spain's center-left
<br>electorate (gay rights, curbing the power of the Catholic
<br>Church, better relations with regional governments in
<br>Catalonia and the Basque Region) further broadening the
<br>Socialists' appeal. Aznar and the PP, meanwhile, remain
<br>unapologetic for their handling of the 3/11 bombings and
<br>declined to sideline leaders discredited by their actions in
<br>the wake of the bombings, further eroding their public
<br>support. Zapatero's main internal challenge is an effort by
<br>the Basque Regional Government (comprised of moderate Basque
<br>nationalists opposed to ETA violence) to increase its
<br>autonomy from Spain's central government. This is a
<br>potential powder keg since most other regions of Spain
<br>strongly oppose increasing the Basque Region's already
<br>considerable independence, unless they too are given greater
<br>independence.
<br>
<br>------------------------
<br>RECENT POSITIVE GESTURES
<br>------------------------
<br>¶9. (C) Since November 2004, Spanish officials at all levels
<br>have made clear their desire to restore strong bilateral
<br>ties, with the Foreign Ministry's Director General for
<br>Foreign Policy (under secretary equivalent) telling us
<br>bluntly, "We want back in." In response, we've told our
<br>Spanish contacts that we are prepared to move forward on
<br>issues of bilateral importance and that unambiguous, positive
<br>steps by Spain would be the best signal to the USG that they
<br>too were ready to move forward. Spain subsequently agreed to
<br>USG requests that it lead a Provincial Reconstruction Team
<br>and a Forward Support Base in western Afghanistan as part of
<br>NATO's mission in that country, issued positive statements
<br>regarding the Iraq elections, and contributed $20 million to
<br>the Iraq elections fund. Spain also continues to disburse
<br>$300 million in assistance to Iraq pledged during the 2003
<br>Iraq Donors Conference in Madrid, and has agreed to train
<br>Iraqi security forces in Spain. We fully expect Minister
<br>Bono to highlight these moves to you as evidence that Spain
<br>has taken significant steps to demonstrate its interest in
<br>improving relations with the U.S.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) The USG has welcomed these steps, while making clear
<br>that we remain troubled by mixed signals from Spain, such
<br>as that sent by Spain's policy of engagement with Hugo
<br>Chavez. We also want Spain to lift its caveats on the
<br>deployment of Spanish NATO officers to participate in NATO
<br>missions, and lift the caveats on its national forces'
<br>actions in Afghanistan.
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Some in the Spanish government, including Bono, have
<br>expressed the belief that Spain is getting little in return
<br>for these positive steps. Bono has said that at times it
<br>appears the U.S. focuses only the on the problems in
<br>U.S.-Spain relations, not the positives (reftel).
<br>
<br>--------------------------------
<br>COMMENT: SENDING A CLEAR MESSAGE
<br>--------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) The USG will not re-establish with the Zapatero
<br>government the deep and close relationship we had with the
<br>Aznar administration. Nonetheless, the U.S. has key
<br>interests in Spain we are working hard to promote and secure,
<br>not the least of which are continued access to Spanish
<br>military bases (including flight clearances) and
<br>counterterrorism cooperation. Spanish officials -- including
<br>Zapatero and Bono -- have expressed surprise that their
<br>Venezuela policy could derail recent improvements in
<br>U.S.-Spain relations. This is despite that fact that this
<br>embassy and various U.S. officials, including Deputy
<br>Secretary Zoellick, have told the Spanish that engaging
<br>
<br>SIPDIS
<br>Chavez and selling him military hardware could hurt relations
<br>at this sensitive time. Bono and others have also said they
<br>feel that the U.S. does not sufficiently recognize the
<br>positive steps Spain has taken to improve relations with the
<br>U.S. Your meeting with Bono can be an opportunity to make
<br>clear that while the U.S. appreciates Spain's cooperation in
<br>Afghanistan, the full access Spain has granted U.S. forces to
<br>its military bases, its continued monetary contributions to
<br>Iraq reconstruction and other positive steps, the U.S.
<br>remains concerned about Spanish actions that negatively
<br>affect our interests, such as Zapatero's Venezuela policy.
