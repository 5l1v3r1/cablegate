<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary. The DCM on January 16 met with Angel Acebes,
<br>Secretary General of the opposition Popular Party (PP) and
<br>
<br>SIPDIS
<br>Minister of Interior under former President Aznar. The
<br>meeting covered a myriad of foreign policy issues. Acebes
<br>reiterated his party's strong disagreement with the
<br>anti-terrorism policies of President Zapatero and the PP's
<br>belief that there is absolutely nothing to negotiate with
<br>ETA. Acebes also professed his party's strong support for
<br>much of President Bush's foreign policy agenda. On Cuba, the
<br>DCM thanked the PP for raising a Parliamentary motion on
<br>December 19 calling for unity among Spanish political parties
<br>in supporting a democratic transition in Cuba. Although
<br>Zapatero's far-left allies in Parliament scuttled the effort,
<br>Acebes said his party will bring this resolution up again in
<br>the coming weeks. End Summary.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) In a January 16 introductory courtesy call on Angel
<br>Acebes, Secretary General of the opposition Popular Party
<br>(PP), the DCM reviewed the current areas of close cooperation
<br>between the U.S. and Spain in NATO, Afghanistan, and Lebanon.
<br>The DCM discussed our close cooperation now and particularly
<br>in the past with the PP and the Aznar government, but said
<br>that it was important for us to now work with the current GOS
<br>on a variety of issues. Acebes replied that he understood
<br>this perfectly, indeed it was good for him as a Spaniard that
<br>the U.S. and Spain have good working relations, but believed
<br>that bilateral relations would improve even more in the
<br>future when the PP returns to power. The DCM noted the
<br>continued range and frequency of high-level contacts between
<br>the Embassy and the PP, including at the Ambassadorial level.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) The DCM asked Acebes for his thoughts on the
<br>contentious debate between President Zapatero and PP leader
<br>Mariano Rajoy that had taken place in Spanish Parliament the
<br>day before (reported separately in REFTEL A), and what has
<br>become the defining political issue of the day in Spain, the
<br>GOS' policies towards the terrorist group ETA. Acebes stated
<br>that Rajoy had indeed been very severe in his criticisms of
<br>the President, because this issue was of the most severe
<br>importance to the Spanish people. Acebes then added that
<br>Rajoy had criticized Zapatero's anti-terrorism policy, "not
<br>for the mere purpose of Parliamentary debate or to win
<br>elections, but because of the party's strongly-held
<br>principles." Despite Zapatero's calls for all of Spain's
<br>democratic political parties to join a united anti-terrorist
<br>pact, Acebes said that the PP would not join in any coalition
<br>with parties that support continued dialogue with ETA or
<br>political participation with ETA's outlawed political wing
<br>Batasuna. Acebes said his party fears that a broad pact
<br>would also broaden and weaken its terms to accommodate
<br>Zapatero,s left-wing coalition partners and ultimately give
<br>him the wiggle room for a future negotiated settlement.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Acebes and the DCM then touched on a full range of
<br>foreign policy issues related to Iraq, Iran, and Cuba. The
<br>DCM briefed Acebes on the impetus behind President Bush's new
<br>strategy for the way forward in Iraq that will include
<br>increases in the number of U.S. troops in Baghdad and U.S.
<br>economic assistance. The DCM said that the U.S. and the
<br>Zapatero Government have agreed to move beyond past
<br>disagreements over the war and we continue to appreciate
<br>Spain's continued economic assistance to the country. Acebes
<br>agreed that the Coalition cannot afford to fail in Iraq and
<br>expressed his hope that this change in strategy will serve to
<br>get a handle on security in Baghdad and al-Anbar Province.
<br>On Iran, Acebes was in agreement on the importance of the
<br>U.S. and the E.U. maintaining a united front against that
<br>country's nuclear ambitions, and posited that Iran likely
<br>represented the "crisis to come." Acebes said that Spain
<br>should work within the E.U. to ensure that a hard line is
<br>maintained. Acebes expressed his concern with the antics of
<br>Iranian President Ahmadinejad during his recent visit to
<br>Nicaragua.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) A discussion of the current situation in Cuba wrapped
<br>up the meeting, and Acebes stated that Fidel Castro's health
<br>prognosis is likely very bad. Whatever the truth behind
<br>recent conflicting reports in Spanish newspapers on the
<br>status of Castro's health (REFTEL B), Acebes believes that we
<br>are already in a "post-Fidel era," and agreed with the DCM
<br>that Raul Castro and other senior regime figures are right
<br>now gauging the international community's reaction to events
<br>in the country before deciding how to proceed. Acebes stated
<br>that for this reason, it is vital for the U.S. and E.U. to
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000116 002 OF 002
<br>
<br>
<br>speak with one voice. The DCM reiterated the importance of
<br>the E.U. making a statement of strong support for a
<br>democratic Cuba, even if this statement is not made jointly
<br>with the U.S., and Acebes agreed. The DCM thanked the PP for
<br>raising a Parliamentary motion December 19 calling for unity
<br>among Spanish political parties in supporting a democratic
<br>transition in Cuba (REFTEL C). Although Foreign Minister
<br>Moratinos had signaled to PP Parliamentarians that a common
<br>position on Cuba could be negotiated, the PP measure was
<br>defeated by the Socialist Party (PSOE) and its far left
<br>coalition partners. Acebes told the DCM that the PP intends
<br>to bring this resolution up again in the coming weeks and
<br>will probably propose a similar motion in the European
<br>Parliament, where it expects greater success. (Note:
<br>Following this meeting, the DCM met with PP foreign policy
<br>advisor Moragas and with the leadership of President Aznar's
<br>think tank, FAES, to suggest FAES and the Embassy coordinate
<br>on a major seminar on Cuba in Madrid in the coming months.
<br>FAES officials were receptive to the idea and undertook to
<br>give a definitive answer to the DCM soon.)
