<br>SUBJECT: SVETLANA MEDVEDEVA STEPS INTO THE SPOTLIGHT 
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) Summary: Since Dmitriy Medvedev's election to the 
<br>post of president, a degree of uncertainty permeated the 
<br>press as the public tried to figure out what role his wife, 
<br>Svetlana Medvedeva, would play in the new administration. 
<br>The role of First Ladies in Russia and the Soviet Union has 
<br>often been a contentious issue. Some, such as Raisa 
<br>Gorbacheva, were quite active and frequently seen in public, 
<br>while others, such as Lyudmila Putina, were more reclusive 
<br>and less involved in state affairs. Due to her recent 
<br>involvement in the planning for the "Day of Family, Love, and 
<br>Fidelity," many have compared Medvedeva to Gorbacheva, but 
<br>that analogy seems less apt; instead she seems to be 
<br>altogether a new type of Russian First Lady, one who is more 
<br>active than Putina, but -- for now -- less flashy than 
<br>Gorbacheva. 
<br>
<br>Previous First Ladies 
<br>--------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) In a May 14 article, Georgiy Zotov of the Moscow 
<br>daily Argumenty i Fakty attempted to compare the roles of 
<br>several Russian first ladies to set-up a context for 
<br>Medvedeva's recent activities. While Naina Khrushcheva did 
<br>travel with her husband to the U.S., she was not involved in 
<br>his decision making. Viktoriya Brezhneva was not involved in 
<br>her husband's public life. Raisa Gorbacheva was perhaps the 
<br>most controversial; the public saw her as being overly active 
<br>and her stylish dress provoked much criticism as the Soviet 
<br>Union teetered economically. Yet Zotov asserted that Mikhail 
<br>Gorbachev would not make any decisions without first 
<br>consulting her. Naina Yeltsina always traveled with her 
<br>husband but spent her time smoothing his increasingly erratic 
<br>edges, while devoting her many energies to philanthropy. 
<br>Then there was Lyudmila Putina, the least active publicly of 
<br>all First Ladies. Putina typically appeared at those events 
<br>required by protocol and avoided making public statements. 
<br>Over time, as rumors started over her health and the 
<br>extramarital pursuits of her husband, she became increasingly 
<br>remote, frumpy (to a condescending Moscow elite), and distant 
<br>from public life. She even chose not to accompany her 
<br>husband to Sochi for his farewell meeting as president with 
<br>President Bush. 
<br>
<br>Svetlana Medvedeva as First Lady 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) Svetlana Medvedeva does not fit neatly into any of 
<br>these roles. After graduating from the Leningrad 
<br>Financial-Economic Institute in 1987, she worked for several 
<br>years but gave up her job at the behest of her husband when 
<br>their son was born in 1995. Yet many have characterized her 
<br>as the driving force both in the family and in Dmitriy 
<br>Medvedev's career. Sources close to the couple describe 
<br>Medvedeva as charismatic, and as having opened up doors for 
<br>her husband, then a non-important law school professor in the 
<br>early 90's when they lived in St. Petersburg. Recently, she 
<br>has worked almost exclusively on a variety of cultural and 
<br>philanthropic initiatives and has a strong connection with 
<br>the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC). Some of her activities 
<br>include the Festival of Russian Art and the Council for the 
<br>Spiritual-Moral Culture of the Rising Generation of Russia 
<br>that was founded by Aleksey II. 
<br>
<br>Criticisms of Medvedeva 
<br>----------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) Few have directly criticized Medvedeva in the 
<br>media -- a taboo set by Putin as president -- most simply 
<br>have noted her previous social habits. When the couple moved 
<br>to Moscow as Medvedev's governmental career took off in the 
<br>mid-1990's, Medvedeva was known to frequent elite parties, 
<br>fashion shows, and the circles of high society. Many have 
<br>noted her penchant for high fashion, just like Gorbacheva, 
<br>which is why the two are often compared. However, on 
<br>becoming First Lady, Medvedeva took a half-step back from 
<br>public view, most likely once again at Medvedev's behest. 
<br>She and the Kremlin seem cognizant of the attention that is 
<br>being placed on her and are trying to find a balance between 
<br>the reclusiveness of Putina and the perceived 
<br>ostentatiousness of Gorbacheva. XXXXXXXXXXXX attributed
<br>his inability to interview  Medvedeva in person as "over
<br>cautiousness" by Medvedev's  handlers, fearful of inciting
<br>public opinion against an  "overly ambitious" Kremlin spouse. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) Most recently, Medvedeva took the national stage 
<br>with planning for the new Russian holiday, the "Day of 
<br>Family, Love, and Fidelity." Medvedeva was at the forefront 
<br>of this project's spiritual and moral realm because of her 
<br>links with the ROC. The holiday was celebrated on July 8 
<br>
<br>MOSCOW 00002306 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>because, according to the Orthodox Church's calendar, this is 
<br>the holy day for the patron saints of families. According to 
<br>a Russian legend, a Ryazan peasant's daughter named Fevroniy 
<br>cured a prince Peter from Murom, who then married her against 
<br>the wishes of his family. They lived a long and happy life 
<br>together, died within hours of each other, and in 1547, were 
<br>canonized. While festivals have been held in Murom on this 
<br>date for centuries to celebrate the two saints, some 
<br>political observers noted to us the irony of this childless 
<br>couple being chosen to headline Russia's pro-family message. 
<br>While discussing the holiday with the media, Medvedeva summed 
<br>up her role in the initiative, saying "A woman should by her 
<br>nature strive for humility. Her mission is to keep peace and 
<br>love in the family. Of course, today's couples are more 
<br>inclined to a balanced relationship." 
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) While there has been no direct criticism of 
<br>Medvedeva and this recent family-based initiative, the 
<br>government's policies towards the demographic problem 
<br>continue to be criticized for not effectively addressing the 
<br>political, cultural, and economic causes of the problem. 
<br>Olga Vorobyeva, chair of Social Statistics and Demography at 
<br>Russian State Social University, said that initiatives 
<br>addressing the demographic problem need a two-pronged 
<br>approach, improving family-life values and the public 
<br>mentality. She also cited housing problems and access to 
<br>education as contributing factors. Mikhail Nikolayev, Deputy 
<br>Speaker of the Federation Council, said that the economic 
<br>problems of families are not being adequately addressed by 
<br>the government. Nikolayev also stressed the need for 
<br>spiritual and moral education. 
<br>
<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) As president, Medvedev has said that he wants 
<br>Russians to be optimistic about their country's future, and 
<br>Medvedeva has carefully chosen to spearhead an issue that 
<br>clearly conforms to his priorities. While she took an active 
<br>role in planning the "Day of Family, Love, and Fidelity," she 
<br>has been careful not to attract too much attention to 
<br>herself. Despite Medvedeva's fascination with high fashion, 
<br>she -- or her handlers -- has made an apparent conscious 
<br>decision to avoid unflattering references to Gorbacheva; 
<br>instead she has chosen to chart her own path, publicly 
<br>engaging in philanthropy and work with the ROC, while 
<br>purportedly exerting influence on Medvedev behind the scenes.
