<br>Subject: spanish metal merchant supplies syrian entities
<br>of proliferation concern (s)
<br>
<br>Classified By: ISN/MTR DIRECTOR PAM DURHAM FOR REASONS
<br>1.4 (b), (c), and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (U) This is an action request. Embassy Madrid
<br>please see paragraph 4.
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) Background: The U.S. has information indicating
<br>that since at least 2003, the Spanish firm Aceros IMS
<br>has maintained a business relationship with the Syrian
<br>firms xxxxxxxxxxxx - firms we believe could be
<br>acting on behalf of the Scientific Studies and Research
<br>Center (SSRC), the entity responsible for overseeing
<br>Syria's WMD and missile programs. Aceros has been
<br>involved with xxxxxxxxxxxx, and xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>in negotiations for the supply of a variety of steels
<br>and aluminum alloys, xxxxxxxxxxxx. Both of these materials can be used in structural support components in ballistic missiles
<br>and in some forms are controlled by the Nuclear
<br>Suppliers Group and Wassenaar Arrangement. xxxxxxxxxxxx, 
<br>Aceros supplied xxxxxxxxxxxx with over
<br>two metric tons of aluminum and steel. This
<br>consignment was shipped from the Spanish port of
<br>Castillon to Lattakia, Syria aboard the M/V Fast
<br>Independence.
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) Objectives: We want to share this information
<br>with Spanish officials and urge them to take all
<br>appropriate measures to ensure that Aceros is not
<br>acting as a supplier to Syrian entities of
<br>proliferation concern. We also want to advise the GOS
<br>that sanctions pursuant to U.S. law could be imposed on
<br>Aceros if the firm is found to have supplied Syria with
<br>regime-controlled items.
<br>
<br>¶4. (U) Action Request: Request Embassy Madrid approach
<br>appropriate Spanish government officials to deliver
<br>talking points/non-paper in paragraph 5 below and
<br>report response. Talking points also may be provided
<br>as a non-paper.
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) Begin talking points/non-paper:
<br>
<br>(secret//rel spain)
<br>
<br>-- We would like to raise with you a matter of
<br>proliferation concern and request your government's
<br>assistance in investigating this activity.
<br>
<br>-- We have information indicating that the Spanish firm
<br>Aceros IMS has, since at least 2003, maintained a
<br>business relationship with several Syrian entities that
<br>have sought materials that may be diverted to Syria's
<br>weapons development programs, possibly via the
<br>Scientific Studies and Research Center (SSRC).
<br>
<br>-- As you will recall from Missile Technology Control
<br>Regime (MTCR) Information Exchange meetings, the SSRC
<br>is the agency responsible for overseeing Syria's WMD
<br>and missile programs.
<br>
<br>-- Aceros has been involved in negotiations for the
<br>supply of a variety of steels and aluminum alloys with
<br>the following companies: xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>
<br>-- We do not know the quantity of material supplied by
<br>Aceros to Syria, but believe that at least some of it
<br>was specifically intended for use in Syria's ballistic
<br>missile program.
<br>
<br>-- Among the materials Aceros and the companies were
<br>discussing werexxxxxxxxxxxx. Both of
<br>these materials are suitable for use in structural
<br>components in ballistic missiles and in some forms are
<br>controlled by the Nuclear Suppliers Group and Wassenaar
<br>Arrangement.
<br>
<br>-- In addition, as recently as early November 2008,
<br>Aceros shipped a consignment of over two metric tons of
<br>aluminum and steel aboard the M/V Fast Independence
<br>from Castillon, Spain, for eventual discharge in
<br>Lattakia, Syria, where the end-user was xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>
<br>-- We encourage you to investigate this information and
<br>take appropriate measures to ensure that Aceros is not
<br>acting as a source of supply to Syria's weapons
<br>development programs.
<br>
<br>-- We also want to advise you that sanctions pursuant
<br>to the U.S. Iran, North Korea, and Syria
<br>Nonproliferation Act could be imposed on Aceros if the
<br>firm is found to have supplied Syria with regime-
<br>controlled materials.
<br>
<br>-- We appreciate your cooperation on nonproliferation
<br>matters and look forward to hearing the results of your
<br>investigation.
<br>
<br>End talking points/nonpaper.
<br>
<br>¶6. xxxxxxxxxxxx
