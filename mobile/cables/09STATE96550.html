<br>provided to Posts septel.  Posts please notify the Department 
<br>regarding date of delivery, recipients, and reaction, if any. 
<br> END ACTION REQUEST. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (U) BEGIN TEXT OF TALKING POINTS: 
<br> 
<br>U.S. MISSILE DEFENSE POLICY - EUROPEAN DECISION 
<br> 
<br>- The White House announced that the President has approved 
<br>Secretary Gates and the Joint Chiefs of Staff's unanimous 
<br>recommendation for improved missile defenses in Europe 
<br>against the threat from Iran to our forces and families 
<br>deployed to the region and to our Allies. 
<br> 
<br>- Iran already has hundreds of ballistic missiles that can 
<br>threaten its neighbors in the Middle East, Turkey, and the 
<br>Caucasus and it is actively developing and testing ballistic 
<br>missiles that can reach more and more of Europe. 
<br>-- Our concern regarding Iranian missile capabilities is 
<br>further increased by the fact that our Intelligence Community 
<br>continues to assess that Iran, at a minimum, is keeping open 
<br>the option to develop nuclear weapons. 
<br> 
<br>- The new "Phased, Adaptive Approach" recommended by 
<br>Secretary Gates updates and revises the previous program for 
<br>missile defense in Europe based on two key findings of the 
<br>DoD review: 
<br>-- First, the threat from Iran's regional ballistic missiles 
<br>has developed more rapidly than previously expected.  At the 
<br>same time, the threat from potential Iranian intercontinental 
<br>ballistic missiles (ICBMs) has been slower to develop than we 
<br> 
<br>STATE 00096550  002 OF 006 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>previously expected. 
<br>-- Second, our missile defense capabilities and technologies 
<br>have advanced significantly.  Improved interceptor 
<br>capabilities, such as the currently deployed Standard 
<br>Missile-3 (SM-3) interceptor and advanced variants that are 
<br>already in development, permit a more flexible and capable 
<br>architecture. 
<br> 
<br>- Therefore, the President has approved a Phased, Adaptive 
<br>Approach that is responsive to the current threat, but also 
<br>can incorporate new technologies quickly and cost-effectively 
<br>to adapt as the threat and our technologies continue to 
<br>change.  It will unfold in phases: 
<br>-- The first phase will speed protection of U.S. deployed 
<br>forces, civilians, and families and our Allies in Europe 
<br>against the current threat from Iran by deploying proven 
<br>systems by 2011 ) about six or seven years earlier than the 
<br>previous program. 
<br>-- Subsequent phases will add advanced variant sea- and 
<br>land-based versions of the SM-3 and cover additional 
<br>territory in Europe should the Iranian threat expand. 
<br>-- In the fourth and final phase we will anticipate 
<br>augmenting our existing capabilities to defend the United 
<br>States against potential advances in Iran's ICBM capability 
<br>with advanced versions of the SM-3.  This would be a similar 
<br>capability to that provided in the program of record. 
<br> 
<br>- This improved approach removes the need for a Ground Based 
<br>Interceptor field in Poland and features a distributed 
<br>interceptor and sensor architecture that does not require the 
<br>single large, fixed radar originally planned to be located in 
<br>the Czech Republic. 
<br>-- Under the new approach, land- and sea-based missile 
<br>defense interceptors and sensors offer some flexibility to be 
<br>redeployed as the regional ballistic missile threat dictates. 
<br> This distributed network approach also will increase the 
<br>survivability of the system and provide more opportunities 
<br>for collaboration with Allies and partners. 
<br>-- We are beginning consultations with Poland, the Czech 
<br>Republic, and other Allies on the new approach, and will work 
<br>with our NATO Allies on determining locations for the sensors 
<br>and interceptors, and on integrating the Phased, Adaptive 
<br>Approach with their missile defense capabilities and with the 
<br>emerging NATO command and control network. 
<br> 
<br>- Strong missile defenses will strengthen our efforts to find 
<br>a solution that brings Iran into compliance with its 
<br>international obligations: the more we can diminish the 
<br>coercive value of Iran's missiles, the less Iran stands to 
<br>gain by continuing to develop these destabilizing 
<br>capabilities. 
<br> 
<br>- This set of recommendations comes from an ongoing 
<br>Congressionally-mandated review that is taking a 
<br>comprehensive examination of our global approach to missile 
<br>defense and is consistent with the Defense Department's 
<br>budget choices for fiscal year 2010: 
<br>-- For example, we added additional funding to field more 
<br>systems such as Aegis BMD ships and SM-3 interceptors.

<br>¶5. (S/REL NATO) BEGIN TEXT OF TALKING POINTS FOR USNATO AND 
<br>EMBASSIES IN NATO CAPITALS (TALKING POINTS BELOW SHOULD BE 
<br>USED FOR ALL NATO CAPITALS EXCEPT FOR POLAND AND THE CZECH 
<br>REPUBLIC; WARSAW AND PRAGUE WILL RECEIVE SEPARATE TAILORED 
<br>TALKING POINTS TO BE DELIVERED ON SEPTEMBER 17 BY THE 
<br>FLOURNOY-TAUSCHER DELEGATION): 
<br> 
<br>GENERAL 
<br> 
<br>- NATO leaders have all agreed that ballistic missile 
<br>proliferation poses an increasing threat to Allies' forces, 
<br>territory, and populations. 
<br> 
<br>- As a result, NATO has noted the significant contribution to 
<br>Alliance security by those Allies who possess, or are 
<br> 
<br>STATE 00096550  003 OF 006 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>acquiring, missile defense capabilities. 
<br> 
<br>- At the 2008 Summit, NATO leaders agreed to consider options 
<br>for a NATO missile defense system that would cover all 
<br>remaining areas of Allied populations and territory.  To 
<br>date, those efforts have focused on missile defense systems 
<br>to protect deployed forces from shorter-range ballistic 
<br>missile threats. 
<br> 
<br>- At the 2009 NATO summit, Heads of State and Government 
<br>tasked experts to examine the potential expansion of the 
<br>ALTBMD program ) which is designed to be the command and 
<br>control "backbone" for theater missile defense for deployed 
<br>forces. 
<br> 
<br>- The United States now proposes a "Phased Adaptive 
<br>Approach," which will reinforce and strengthen on-going NATO 
<br>efforts.  Specifically, we believe that the Phased Adaptive 
<br>Approach is fully supportive of the decision to pursue 
<br>options for a complementary NATO-wide multi-layered BMD 
<br>architecture, which currently is envisioned to use NATO's 
<br>command and control backbone architecture.  This is a 
<br>flexible and cost-effective approach that leverages proven 
<br>technologies against a known threat. 
<br> 
<br>- Most importantly, the Phased Adaptive Approach is designed 
<br>to work in concert with Allied efforts to provide protection 
<br>against ballistic missile attack for all NATO Allies, 
<br>reflecting the Alliance principle of indivisibility of 
<br>security. 
<br> 
<br>- The Phased Adaptive Approach will provide our most proven 
<br>and operational missile defense capabilities in the 
<br>near-term, defending Allied territory sooner against the 
<br>current Iranian threat. 
<br> 
<br>- U.S. missile defense efforts will of course be fully 
<br>interoperable with those of NATO. 
<br> 
<br>- We propose that -- subsequent to Alliance discussions and 
<br>follow-on briefings in greater detail -- the Alliance examine 
<br>how we can integrate the U.S. Phased Adaptive Approach with 
<br>NATO missile defense.  This can be discussed further at the 
<br>upcoming defense ministerial in Bratislava. 
<br> 
<br>- The Phased Adaptive Approach would serve to greatly 
<br>strengthen NATO's missile defense capabilities in the face of 
<br>a growing threat to Alliance security. 
<br> 
<br>- We look forward to engaging the Alliance in political and 
<br>technical discussions in the weeks ahead. 
<br> 
<br>FINANCING (if raised) 
<br>- We will work closely with Allies to examine broader 
<br>resourcing requirements for defense of Allied forces, 
<br>territories and populations, including the integration of our 
<br>Phased Adaptive Approach. 
<br> 
<br>ROLE FOR NATO MEMBERS 
<br>- We have already consulted with the two Allies that had 
<br>agreed to host missile defense assets under the previous 
<br>plan.  I want to reiterate that we are deeply appreciative of 
<br>their readiness to take difficult political decisions to 
<br>respond to the need to better protect allied territories and 
<br>populations against the threat of ballistic missiles. 
<br> 
<br>- We intend to engage in active consultations at NATO on the 
<br>best way forward. 
<br> 
<br>- The "Phased Adaptive Approach" is flexible and could be 
<br>integrated into a NATO territorial missile defense system. 
<br>There will be a requirement for Allies to host the sensors 
<br>and interceptors to be included in the Phased Adaptive 
<br>Approach.   There are many possibilities, and we look forward 
<br>to continuing our NATO consultations. 
<br> 
<br>- If pressed:  At this time, I would prefer not to get into 
<br> 
<br>STATE 00096550  004 OF 006 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>specific issues related to potential Host Nations.    We have 
<br>many options in this flexible architecture ) sea- and 
<br>land-based, northern and southern Europe.  We intend to 
<br>engage soon at NATO with Allies on those questions. 
<br> 
<br>- We expect that Allied national systems or current NATO 
<br>systems will be able to integrate well with the overall 
<br>phased approach. 
<br> 
<br>- Allied contributions can be interoperable with the Phased 
<br>Approach missile defense architecture to ensure they form a 
<br>cost-effective and comprehensive architecture. 
<br> 
<br>GROUND BASED INTERCEPTORS 
<br>- If needed:  The U.S. will continue to develop the GBI 
<br>technology for CONUS defense because domestically it remains 
<br>a cost-effective option. However, we have no plans to pursue 
<br>GBIs in Europe given the promise and track record of SM-3 
<br>technology. 
<br> 
<br>END TEXT OF TALKING POINTS FOR NATO. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C/REL RUSSIA)  BEGIN TEXT OF TALKING POINTS FOR RUSSIA: 
<br> 
<br>- The President's missile defense in Europe decision will 
<br>publicly be announced at 10:00 a.m. Washington, D.C. time. 
<br>The  National Security Advisor, General Jones, will be 
<br>delivering a similar message to Ambassador Kislyak before the 
<br>announcement. 
<br> 
<br>- The decision is the result of a long review process; new 
<br>information on the Iranian ballistic missile program drove 
<br>the decision. 
<br> 
<br>- Iran has made more progress on short-range and medium-range 
<br>ballistic missiles, and less progress on ICBMs than 
<br>anticipated. Now the threat is greater to the Middle East and 
<br>to Europe, with a less immediate threat to the United States. 
<br> 
<br>- We do not plan to deploy GBIs in Poland and we will not 
<br>base the European Mid-Course radar in the Czech Republic. 
<br>Instead, there will be an adaptive, phased approach. 
<br> 
<br>- We believe that Iran plans to deploy hundreds of these 
<br>short-range and medium-range ballistic missiles.  Our old 
<br>plan was designed to intercept only small numbers of ICBMs. 
<br> 
<br>- There is no doubt that Iran is developing these missiles to 
<br>arm them with a nuclear warhead.  There is NO OTHER REASON to 
<br>spend so much time and effort into developing these missiles. 
<br> They are not useful weapons if only armed with a 
<br>conventional warhead. 
<br> 
<br>- The new plan for European missile defense is better 
<br>designed to protect Europe from this Iranian threat that is 
<br>emerging.  We intend to deploy the SM-3 interceptor which is 
<br>what we are deploying in the Middle East as well.  SM-3s do 
<br>not have the capability to threaten Russian ICBMs. 
<br> 
<br>- In the first stages of deployment, we also are seeking to 
<br>place these interceptors closer to Iran (from what I 
<br>understand, this is exactly the idea that President Putin 
<br>proposed to President Bush during their July 2007 meeting at 
<br>Kennebunkport, Maine). 
<br> 
<br>- The new plan calls for radars and detection systems to be 
<br>deployed closer to Iran.  These radars will not have the 
<br>capacity to track Russian ICBMs. 
<br> 
<br>- With this decision behind us, we now want to move 
<br>aggressively to launch serious cooperation on missile defense 
<br>with Russia. 
<br> 
<br>- As the President said during his meeting with President 
<br>Medvedev in April, we want to begin by standing up the Joint 
<br>Data Exchange Center (JDEC).  The hope is to share data from 
<br>our respective early-warning systems. 
<br>

<br> 
<br>END TEXT OF TALKING POINTS FOR RUSSIA. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C/REL JAPAN) BEGIN TEXT OF TALKING POINTS FOR JAPAN: 
<br> 
<br>- The U.S. greatly appreciates Japan's partnership in BMD; we 
<br>remain deeply committed to strengthening regional BMD 
<br>capabilities including operational cooperation, joint 
<br>research, and co-development. 
<br> 
<br>- Recent North Korean provocations serve as a reminder of the 
<br>importance of our cooperative missile defense efforts, which 
<br>help underpin a strong U.S.-Japan Alliance and contribute to 
<br>regional stability. 
<br> 
<br>- We remain committed to an effective defense of the U.S. and 
<br>our Allies against rogue ballistic missile threats, including 
<br>North Korea and, if it continues down its current path, Iran. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>- As you are aware, the BMD Review has undertaken a 
<br>comprehensive examination of our approach to missile 
<br>defenses, including an in-depth look at our approach to 
<br>European missile defense and in other regions around the 
<br>world. 
<br>-- USG discussions with the MOD and MOFA over the last 
<br>several months made clear that you have particular interest 
<br>in the European missile defense analysis -- we understand 
<br>these strategic decisions have an impact in the Asia-Pacific 
<br>region and want to make sure you are fully informed of our 
<br>results. 
<br>-- Throughout the review process the U.S. recognized and 
<br>factored in Japanese concerns/equities especially those 
<br>related to our on-going discussions with the Russian 
<br>Federation. 
<br> 
<br>- Although the BMD Review report is not due to Congress until 
<br>this January, we have already reached some important 
<br>conclusions.  We have decided to move forward with discussing 
<br>results now so we do not delay deploying improved defenses 
<br>for ourselves or our allies. 
<br> 
<br>OTHER CONSULTATIONS 
<br> 
<br>- We would like to explain the President's decision to you 
<br>before our public announcement and before we speak with 
<br>Russia.  We are discussing this new European approach with 
<br>Poland, the Czech Republic, and NATO, as we speak. 
<br>-- As a close and trusted ally, we consider it important to 
<br>share this information with you.  However, in light of past 
<br>problems with information security, we must insist that you 
<br>take every precaution to ensure that this information will 
<br>not be leaked.  Any leaks would have significant implications 
<br>for our European missile defense approach, and would be 
<br>damaging to our bilateral relationship.  Should there be a 
<br>security breach elsewhere, it is important that our 
<br>governments not officially confirm leaked information if it 
<br>appears in the media before official release by the U.S. 
<br>Government. 
<br> 
<br>THE PHASED ADAPTIVE APPROACH 
<br> 
<br>- As you have seen, the new plan for European missile defense 
<br>will use the SM-3 interceptor, both land- and sea-based, 
<br>rather than GBIs included in the previous program. 
<br> 
<br>- In many ways, your leadership and partnership in the 
<br>development of the SM-3 and in operational coordination have 
<br>been critical to our development of this new approach to 
<br>Europe.  Just as we have cooperatively deployed proven and 
<br>transportable missile defenses to help defend against 
<br>ballistic missile threats in the Asia-Pacific region, we will 
<br>deploy those same technologies and capabilities in Europe. 
<br> 
<br>- At this time, the new European approach is based on 
<br>U.S.-owned SM-3s.  However, we will want to look at future 
<br>missile defense opportunities with NATO and our European 
<br> 
<br>STATE 00096550  006 OF 006 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>allies that could include potential sales of a number of 
<br>missile defense capabilities.  We would very much like to 
<br>work with Japan to make strategic decisions about whether and 
<br>how our jointly developed missile (i.e., the SM-3 Block IIA) 
<br>could be part of that future, and perhaps part of a future 
<br>networked global system of regional missile defense 
<br>architectures. 
<br> 
<br>- We look forward to continuing our strong partnership on 
<br>missile defense and growing our cooperative activities. 
<br> 
<br>BMD FOR JAPAN AND EAST ASIA 
<br> 
<br>- As mentioned previously, the phased approach in Europe is 
<br>in many ways similar to the approach we have taken with you. 
<br>We believe that our current approach in the Asia- Pacific 
<br>region is sound and forms a model that we can draw upon 
<br>elsewhere.  Naturally, we will re-engage with you soon on the 
<br>full findings of our BMD Review. 
<br> 
<br>IF ASKED ABOUT BURDEN SHARING AT NATO: 
<br> 
<br>- As you well know, this type of approach creates 
<br>opportunities for participation ) for example, in command 
<br>and control, sensors, and interceptors ) and enhanced 
<br>cooperation, similar to the type that we already enjoy.  We 
<br>look forward to engaging with NATO soon about how our new 
<br>approach contributes to common defenses and how we can share 
<br>responsibilities in that effort.

<br>¶8. (U) BEGIN TEXT OF TALKING POINTS FOR GULF COOPERATION 
<br>COUNCIL STATES (BAHRAIN, KUWAIT, OMAN, QATAR, SAUDI ARABIA, 
<br>UNITED ARAB EMIRATES): 
<br> 
<br>- The USG has adopted a phased adaptive approach for the 
<br>ballistic missile defense (BMD) of Europe.  The approach in 
<br>Europe complements the emerging BMD architecture in the Gulf, 
<br>which is currently defending against potential Iranian air 
<br>and missile threats to our partners and U.S. forces in the 
<br>Gulf region. 
<br>-- We are working to optimize limited assets to ensure that 
<br>programs in Europe will not be executed at the expense of our 
<br>friends and commitment to the defense of the Gulf Cooperation 
<br>Council. 
<br>-- BMD programs in Europe will not require a diversion of 
<br>U.S. assets from the Gulf. 
<br> 
<br>- The United States has deployed BMD systems to the Middle 
<br>East to protect against the Iranian missile threat, including 
<br>AEGIS BMD presence in the Persian Gulf and two PATRIOT 
<br>batteries each in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and the UAE. 
<br>-- These U.S. systems complement the indigenous BMD systems 
<br>in the region including PAC-II capability in Saudi Arabia and 
<br>Kuwait, and Shared Early Warning capability with the UAE. 
<br>-- The USG is exploring the possibility of providing 
<br>additional BMD coverage to Gulf Cooperation Council nations 
<br>if the circumstances warrant. 
<br>-- The USG will continue to work with its Gulf partners to 
<br>develop regional, integrated air and missile defense systems.
