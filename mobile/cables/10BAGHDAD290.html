<br>TENDENCIES AND DENOUNCES IRANIAN INTERFERENCE 
<br>
<br>REF: A. BAGHDAD 278 
<br>¶B. BAGHDAD 285 
<br>¶C. BAGHDAD 153 
<br>
<br>Classified By: MINISTER-COUNSELOR FOR POLITICAL AFFAIRS GARY A. GRAPPO 
<br>FOR REASONS 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY AND COMMENT: Iraqiyya coalition leader Ayad 
<br>Allawi told A/DCM on February 2 that the Accountability and 
<br>Justice Commission's (AJC) effort to eliminate candidates on 
<br>de-Ba'athification grounds was symptomatic of a broader 
<br>problem of intimidation in the Iraqi political system. He 
<br>attributed this intimidation to PM Maliki's "centralizing, 
<br>authoritarian" tendencies, citing as proof the PM's recent 
<br>intervention in the Salah ad-Din provincial dispute and 
<br>widespread arrests of political rivals over the last year. 
<br>Allawi shared details of his recent meeting with Iran's 
<br>ambassador to Baghdad and worried about the impact of an 
<br>Iranian-sponsored "resistance" conference in Lebanon in late 
<br>January on Iraqi and broader regional stability. In light of 
<br>recent polls that show Allawi and Maliki as top contenders 
<br>for the premiership, we anticipate that they will use the 
<br>upcoming campaign to attack each other's track records. END 
<br>SUMMARY AND COMMENT. 
<br>
<br>DE-BA'ATH PART OF A BROADER INTIMIDATION CAMPAIGN 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Former PM and Iraqiyya coalition head Ayad Allawi told 
<br>A/DCM on February 2 that the de-Ba'athification process was 
<br>destabilizing Iraq. He claimed this was part and parcel of 
<br>PM Maliki's "campaign of intimidation" to alter the political 
<br>atmosphere in his favor, including by targeting political 
<br>rivals in widespread arrest operations. Allawi underscored 
<br>the "irrationality" of the Accountability and Justice 
<br>Commission's (AJC) list of disqualified candidates, pointing 
<br>to the inclusion of Iskander Witwit, deputy governor of Babil 
<br>and one of Iraqiyya's candidates, as a particularly egregious 
<br>example. Allawi's ally, MP Maysoon al-Damlougi, explained 
<br>that Witwit was a leader of the Shi'a Shaabaniya uprising 
<br>against Saddam Hussein in 1991 and had lost several brothers 
<br>who opposed the previous regime. (NOTE: A complete readout on 
<br>the de-Ba'athification discussion from this meeting was 
<br>provided in ref A. END NOTE.) 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Allawi thanked the USG for staying engaged on the 
<br>de-Ba'athification issue, and encouraged the Embassy and 
<br>Washington to underscore the repercussions of an illegitimate 
<br>election. Although the United States was "losing muscle" 
<br>with the drawdown of military forces, he commented, it should 
<br>still act firmly to uphold democratic principles so as not to 
<br>allow Iran to capitalize on its diminished presence. A/DCM 
<br>emphasized that the United States would push the Independent 
<br>High Electoral Commission (IHEC) to ensure that the ballot 
<br>printed on February 6 did not exclude candidates who had not 
<br>had their legal appeals finalized by the Cassation Chamber. 
<br>(NOTE: Per ref B, the Cassation Chamber issued a legal 
<br>decision February 3 ordering IHEC to allow all candidates who 
<br>had appealed their de-Ba'athification disqualifications to 
<br>run in the elections. Details septel. END NOTE.) 
<br>
<br>MALIKI AS "AUTHORITARIAN CENTRALIZER" 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Allawi faulted PM Maliki for his tendency to "overly 
<br>centralize" power in Baghdad, either in his own hands or 
<br>those of his allies, comparing it to Saddam's heavy-handed 
<br>tactics. He told A/DCM that the PM's direct intervention in 
<br>the conflict between the Provincial Council and the ousted 
<br>Qthe conflict between the Provincial Council and the ousted 
<br>governor of Salah ad-Din was tied to his deal with Parliament 
<br>Speaker Sammarrai'e to attain the Iraqi Islamic Party's (IIP) 
<br>support in government formation. (NOTE: Details septel. END 
<br>NOTE.) Allawi asserted that Maliki's efforts to concentrate 
<br>power would have wide-reaching implications for national 
<br>security, due to the PM's patronage appointments in the 
<br>intelligence services. (NOTE: This subject will be addressed 
<br>septel. END NOTE.) 
<br>
<br>PRESSURE ENGULFS IRAQI-IRANIAN RELATIONS 
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Allawi shared that, at President Talabani's behest, 
<br>Iraqiyya's leaders, including Iraqi Front for National 
<br>Dialogue (IFND) head Saleh al-Mutlaq, met with Iranian 
<br>Ambassador Qomi in late January to discuss the 
<br>de-Ba'athification situation. Allawi reportedly challenged 
<br>Qomi to prove Iran's good intentions in Iraq by making a 
<br>public statement calling for fair, transparent elections in 
<br>Iraq and by telling his "friends" in Iraq, including senior 
<br>
<br>officials in Shi'a-dominated Iraqi National Alliance (INA) 
<br>and State of Law coalitions, to respect the democratic 
<br>process and not violate the Iraqi Constitution in order to 
<br>promote their own electoral chances. He said that the 
<br>Iranian Ambassador did not respond to these suggestions. 
<br>Allawi noted that he stressed the danger of disproportionate 
<br>Iranian interference and influence in Iraq during his recent 
<br>meetings with Egyptian, Saudi and Emirati leaders, and asked 
<br>those Arab states to engage more closely with Iraq. 
<br>President Mubarak reportedly promised Allawi that he would 
<br>raise this issue with a high-level UK and U.S. delegation 
<br>visiting Egypt. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Expressing his concern about a late January 
<br>"resistance conference" organized by Iran in Lebanon, Allawi 
<br>told A/DCM that it brought together Lebanese Hezbollah, 
<br>Hamas, other terrorist organizations with a number of 
<br>legitimate political actors like Ammar al-Hakim (ISCI 
<br>chairman) from across the region. Characterizing Hakim as 
<br>"stupid" for attending the conference, Allawi said that Hakim 
<br>was pressured at the meeting to drop the political solution 
<br>he and INA partner Badr chief Hadi al-Amiri had developed to 
<br>resolve the de-Ba'ath crisis (ref B). Allawi confided that 
<br>Nabih Berri, Lebanon's speaker of parliament, asked him to 
<br>make a brief trip to Lebanon in late January to discuss the 
<br>conference. Berri's representative reportedly told Allawi 
<br>that Iran had spent USD 70 million on the conference and used 
<br>the event to direct proxy groups in Lebanon to "cause 
<br>trouble" between the Israelis and Egyptians by provoking 
<br>actions on the Sinai or along the Gaza border.
