<br>SUBJECT: NEW SARKOZY-MEDVEDEV AGREEMENT: QUESTIONS REMAIN 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Alice G. Wells for reasons 
<br>1.4(b) and (d) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) Summary: While achieving some key concessions 
<br>from Russia on next steps in the Georgia conflict, the 
<br>Sarkozy-Medvedev agreement from September 8 still leaves open 
<br>questions about the nature and size of Russian troops, role 
<br>of EU observers, and the format of October security talks. 
<br>After contentious talks lasting four hours, the two sides 
<br>reached agreement on the timing of the withdrawal of Russian 
<br>forces from Georgia, international observer mechanisms, and 
<br>the convening of an international conference on security and 
<br>refugees for October 15 in Geneva. FM Lavrov called for 
<br>South Ossetia and Abkhazia to participate in the security 
<br>conference, and announced Russian troops would remain in 
<br>those areas. Medvedev made clear that Russia would not 
<br>reverse its recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. 
<br>Medvedev and especially Putin remain defiant toward the U.S., 
<br>with Deputy Chief of General Staff General Nogovitsyn 
<br>alleging U.S. "complicity" in the armed conflict. Pundits 
<br>claim the September 8 Sarkozy visit a victory for Russia, 
<br>with the Sarkozy follow-on agreement likely to produce the 
<br>Cyprus scenario the Russians say they are comfortable with. 
<br>End Summary 
<br>
<br>------------------ 
<br>Tense negotiations 
<br>------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) In their meeting September 8, Presidents Sarkozy and 
<br>Medvedev discussed their August 12 six-point ceasefire 
<br>agreement and agreed upon additional points in three areas. 
<br>
<br>-- Withdrawal of troops. Within seven days, Russia will 
<br>withdraw its troops from the observation posts between Poti 
<br>and Senaki, while Russia will within 10 days following the 
<br>deployment of "international mechanisms" withdraw its 
<br>peacekeepers from the zones adjacent to South Ossetia and 
<br>Abkhazia to pre-war positions. The document also calls for 
<br>the complete return of Georgian armed forces to their bases 
<br>by October 1, 2008. 
<br>
<br>-- International observation mechanisms. Both the existing 
<br>UN and OSCE observer missions will remain, while "at least 
<br>200" EU monitors will be deployed by October 1, 2008 in the 
<br>zones adjacent to South Ossetia and Abkhazia. 
<br>
<br>-- International discussions. An international conference on 
<br>Caucasus security will begin on October 15, 2008 in Geneva, 
<br>devoted principally to security, refugees and internally 
<br>displaced persons (IDPs). The GOR considers that this 
<br>conference fulfills the requirements of point six of the 
<br>Medvedev-Sarkozy plan of August 12, 2008, which calls for 
<br>international discussions on security and stability 
<br>arrangements. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) XXXXXXXXXXXX  told DCM that the  atmosphere
<br>during the negotiations was quite charged and at  times became
<br>openly hostile. Sarkozy at one point grabbed FM Lavrov by
<br>the lapels and called him a liar in very strong  terms, reacting
<br>to Lavrov's denial that Russia had failed to comply with its
<br>previous withdrawal commitments.XXXXXXXXXX said that
<br>Sarkozy had arrived with a "take it or leave it attitude, very
<br>American in style and very confrontational,"  and the Russians
<br>Had responded icily. Levitte played a central role in negotiating
<br>the text with Prikhodko, who seemed to be under a lot of pressure
<br>and in fairly bad  spirits. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) In the end, the French believe they got the best 
<br>agreement that could be hoped for. XXXXXXXXXXXX said they 
<br>attribute their success primarily to the Russians being ready 
<br>to reach such a deal -- and in fact anxious to have it as a 
<br>way of withdrawing their forces. EU unity and harmony 
<br>between the U.S. and the EU also played a role;
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX  observed that the Russians were
<br>clearly conscious that they  were facing a united front. 
<br>Sarkozy reportedly warned  Medvedev that Russia's standing
<br>as a "serious power" had been  severely harmed and failure
<br>to meet the obligations Russia is  assuming under this agreement
<br>could do a great deal of  further damage. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) XXXXXXXXXXXX added that the Russians
<br>treated Barroso  harshly and condescendingly, and tried to exclude
<br> him from  many of the sessions. The French attributed this to the 
<br>Russian view that Barroso is basically a glorified  international
<br>civil servant "not worthy to be in the Czar's  XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>confirmed that Putin was nowhere to be seen during the visit. 
<br>
<br>MOSCOW 00002701 002 OF 004 
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) In their joint press conference after the meeting, 
<br>Medvedev contrasted the EU and U.S. roles, calling the EU 
<br>"our natural partner, our key partner," and welcoming the EU 
<br>approach as "balanced," while contrasting it to "exotic or 
<br>extremist" positions calling for sanctions. He again accused 
<br>the U.S. of blessing Georgia's desire to use force in the 
<br>conflict, whether by "direct order or silent approval," and 
<br>used this purported U.S. behavior as a reason to call for a 
<br>new world order. Medvedev made clear that Russia would not 
<br>reverse its recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) Sarkozy in turn renewed the EU's rejection of 
<br>Russia's recognition of South Ossetian and Abkhazian 
<br>independence, and at times seemed amused when he thanked 
<br>Medvedev for speaking as the "representative of the European 
<br>position" on Georgia, and again later when he questioned 
<br>Russia's right to "determine Georgia's borders." 
<br>
<br>------------------ 
<br>Ambiguities remain 
<br>------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) By fixing a timeline for withdrawal, the agreement 
<br>succeeds in rendering obsolete Sarkozy's August 14 
<br>clarifications to the August 12 points, to which the GOR 
<br>maintained it had never agreed. However, the September 8 
<br>agreement leaves open several points that are unclear or 
<br>contentious. The number and nature of Russian troops 
<br>remaining in South Ossetia and Abkhazia is not specified. 
<br>Late September 9, Medvedev declared that Russia would keep 
<br>7,600 troops in the two zones; 3,800 in each area. The 
<br>Sarkozy agreement appears to accept Russian conditionality 
<br>that EU observers be limited to the areas "adjacent" to the 
<br>conflict zones. The nature of the international discussions 
<br>leaves the precise format of the talks open, not clarifying 
<br>if Russia will participate as a mediator or as one of the 
<br>conflict parties, whether and in what capacity Abkhazia and 
<br>South Ossetia will participate, and what the precise goals of 
<br>the talks are. Finally, while Sarkozy gave Medvedev a 
<br>non-use of force statement signed by Saakashvili, the 
<br>document has no legally binding effect, and it is unclear 
<br>whether there will be an effort to make it legally binding. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Following Sarkozy's departure, FM Lavrov used a press 
<br>conference on September 9 to clarify that Russian troops (not 
<br>peacekeepers) would remain in South Ossetia "for a long 
<br>time," ostensibly to protect the residents there from 
<br>Georgian aggression. On the EU observers, he said their role 
<br>would be to guarantee that Georgia would not use force 
<br>against South Ossetia and Abkhazia. On the international 
<br>discussions, he demanded that South Ossetia and Abkhazia be 
<br>given a seat at the table as full-fledged participants. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (U) Ambassadors and Defense Attaches were invited to a 
<br>briefing by Ministry of Defense spokesman General Anatoliy 
<br>Nogovitsyn September 9. Despite a standing-room only 
<br>attendance Nogovitsyn disappointed the diplomatic corps by 
<br>simply rehashing Russian arguments used to justify Russia's 
<br>actions in Georgia, highlighting the history of the 
<br>agreements authorizing Russian peacekeeping forces and the 
<br>chronology of events from August 6-10. He noted that in 
<br>response to a Georgian request, the U.S. had quickly helped 
<br>withdraw Georgian troops from Iraq and transported them to 
<br>Georgia. By helping Georgia, the U.S. had "set a precedent 
<br>of complicity" in the armed conflict, he claimed. Nogovitsyn 
<br>also showed alleged Georgian plans of attack for Abkhazia 
<br>which Russian forces had "recovered," arguing that they 
<br>showed that Georgia had planned to occupy all of Abkhazia, 
<br>target hospitals and civilian infrastructure, prevent 
<br>refugees from fleeing, etc. He claimed they showed an 
<br>"explicit manifestation of genocide." He said that as of 
<br>September 9, Russia had 2452 peacekeepers in the conflict 
<br>zone. He summarized the plan agreed by Sarkozy and Medvedev 
<br>September 8, only noting that Russia expected the EU to send 
<br>"at least 250" observers. 
<br>
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br>Russia defiant; Tandemocracy watch 
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX claimed  that the EU observer mission,
<br>limited to Georgia proper, was  a diplomatic success for Russia,
<br>even though the GOR on the  eve of the Sarkozy-Medvedev meeting
<br>had categorically refused to allow EU observers to participate in the
<br>post-crisis  management. XXXXXXXXXXXX considered the
<br>Sarkozy-Medvedev deal the most likely  compromise, and the
<br>maximum that either side could expect. He  called the agreement
<br>on Russian troop withdrawal something 
<br>
<br>MOSCOW 00002701 003 OF 004 
<br>
<br>that Moscow needed, in order to escape continued 
<br>international pressure for not honoring its commitments. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Well-connected editors tell us that the mood within 
<br>the ruling circles remains defiant. XXXXXXXXXXXX both 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXX separately
<br>told us September 8 that  they had seen Putin "at his toughest."
<br>Putin brushed aside  the significance of any Western backlash
<br>to Georgia: on the  Sochi Olympics, "let them cancel it: we'll
<br>build one stadium  instead of two;" on energy, "we'll sell Central
<br>Asian gas to  those who want it, including Asia;" on estrangement
<br>with  Europe, "don't worry, European leaders tell me that 
<br>everything will be normal." If the West did not want Russia, 
<br>Russia did not need the West, Putin repeated. "They cannot 
<br>intimidate us." At the same time, XXXXXXXXXXXX stressed
<br>that  Putin did not advocate a preemptively punitive response
<br>and  specifically demurred from pulling Russian investments from 
<br>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, arguing that the markets needed 
<br>more, not less, predictability. Putin maintained that 
<br>Russia wanted to be like China -- to "sit under the roots of 
<br>the tree" and build its power quietly -- but that immediate 
<br>global responsibilities forced it to act. "When Russia is 
<br>challenged, it must respond: we cannot just concede." 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX told us that the leadership continued to
<br>brush  aside the market's punishment of Russian policies,
<br>arguing  that they believe the public line that America's
<br>downturn --  and not Georgia -- has precipitated Russia's beating. 
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) The public allegations made by Medvedev and Putin 
<br>that the U.S. turned a blind eye to, or encouraged, Georgia's 
<br>August 7 attack on Tskhinvali continue to be reinforced in 
<br>private. Putin told the editors that the U.S. was engaged in 
<br>cynical electoral politics and needed to create an "enemy" to 
<br>combat, and received no push back in his description of a 
<br>one-sided U.S. policy aimed at shoring up the "puppet," 
<br>Saakashvili. There was also no argument with Putin's 
<br>assessment that the Georgian leader was politically "dead," 
<br>likely insane, and irrelevant to Russia's decision to 
<br>recognize South Ossetia and Abkhazia. XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br> marveled at  Putin's posture, noting the Prime Minister was 
<br>"convinced that right was on his side," and authoritarian in tone. 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX,  warned us that Russian actions were
<br>animated by a wave of  patriotism and anti-American sentiment.
<br>"Never have Russians been so united behind Putin and Medvedev" 
<br>a stance made easier, he noted, by the public revulsion towards 
<br>Saakashvili, which he shared. 
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) In assessing the ruling tandem, XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br> stressed that "Putin had proved himself" in the crisis; while
<br>discounting  the theory that the Prime Minister intended to return
<br>to the  Kremlin soon, XXXXXXXXXXXX said the war in Georgia
<br>made it  absolutely clear that Putin did not intend to leave
<br>Medvedev  alone. While XXXXXXXXXXXX downplayed the
<br>demise of Medvedev's  reform agenda, he agreed that it had been
<br>put to the side. XXXXXXXXXXXX struck a more pessimistic
<br>note, arguing that the war played to the strengths of the anti-war
<br>camp. Russians looked at U.S. statements and concluded that
<br>America was uncomfortable with Russian independence and
<br>hostile to  Russian strategic interests. XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br> argued that having "surrounded" Russia, the U.S. should
<br>understand the backlash  that it produced. 
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX told us on  September 9 that
<br>the President had emerged stronger because  of the
<br>Georgian crisis. Whereas Putin appeared to take the 
<br>lead during the fight, Medvedev showed his mettle by 
<br>arranging the terms to stop the conflict. The decision to 
<br>recognize the separatist regions was "unavoidable" after the 
<br>leadership had decided to go beyond the borders of South 
<br>Ossetia (a decision that XXXXXXXXXXXX linked to Putin's
<br>personal  enmity for Saakashvilli) and underscored that
<br>Moscow could  not backtrack on that decision. Medvedev was
<br>apparently  comfortable with the state of affairs
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX noted that Medvedev looked "relaxed"
<br>during a private dinner at Sochi on  September 2. For the time being,
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX sawMedvedev as  somewhat boxed in and
<br>forced to take a more aggressive,  "emotional" public stance than his
<br>usual lawyerly approach to policy. In the current Russian political
<br>environment, any effort at taking a "softer approach" would only
<br>make him  appear weak. 
<br>
<br>------- 
<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) The September 8 Sarkozy-Medvedev document is a step 
<br>
<br>MOSCOW 00002701 004 OF 004 
<br>
<br>forward in setting clear deadlines for Russian troop 
<br>withdrawal. However, the limits on the EU observer mission, 
<br>as well as questions about the October 15 security 
<br>conference, and Medvedev's insistence that Russia will not 
<br>reverse its decision on recognition, presage the likelihood 
<br>of a new "Cyprus-like" frozen conflict in the Caucasus.
