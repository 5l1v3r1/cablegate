<br>
<br>REF: LA PAZ 1589 
<br>
<br>¶1. 1. Summary and comment: Bolivian Counternarcotics (CN) 
<br>officials have voiced public concern over a number of negative 
<br>trends, including a sharp rise in the number of cocaine 
<br>laboratories seized, the GOB's inability to track the rising number 
<br>of small aircraft used to transport drugs to neighboring countries, 
<br>the increasing presence of foreign drug cartels, and increased coca 
<br>cultivation. Despite positive interdiction and eradication 
<br>statistics (septel), local contacts believe these trends will 
<br>worsen without immediate GOB attention. GOB officials recognize 
<br>the problems, and the overwhelming victory of the ruling Movement 
<br>Toward Socialism (MAS) party (reftel) will give President Morales 
<br>additional power to shape CN policy. Still, he will face 
<br>challenges in stepping up eradication and interdiction efforts, 
<br>risking the anger of coca farmers, the core of his political base. 
<br>This is the first in a series of NAS reports on counternarcotics 
<br>trends and policy in Bolivia. End summary and comment. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Proliferation Of Cocaine Laboratories 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶2. 2. The Department of Cochabamba has become a center for the 
<br>production of cocaine base, according to statements made by FELCN 
<br>commanders to Bolivian press. FELCN Cochabamba Director Colonel 
<br>Elvin Baptista told reporters November 30 that FELCN destroyed 600 
<br>cocaine factories in Cochabamba during 2009. Baptista explained 
<br>that most were found in rural areas, close to rivers or other 
<br>sources of water, and used Colombian methods, which consist of 
<br>grinding up coca using electric motors, and then mixing it with 
<br>precursor chemicals in rigid plastic containers. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶3. 3. FELCN director Colonel Oscar Nina said on November 12 
<br>that the Department of Santa Cruz has become a major center for 
<br>crystallization (purification) of cocaine that is processed in 
<br>other regions of Bolivia. He explained that FELCN had discovered 
<br>16 cocaine crystallization labs during recent operations, one of 
<br>which had the capacity to produce 100 kilos per day of high purity 
<br>cocaine. The cocaine is produced in Santa Cruz, and the drug is 
<br>then exported to Europe and the United States through ports in 
<br>Chile and Brazil, according to Nina. (Note: DEA estimates less than 
<br>one percent of cocaine seized in the U.S. can be chemically traced 
<br>back to Bolivia. End Note). 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶4. 4. FELCN reported that it destroyed an average of two labs 
<br>per day in the Department of La Paz in 2009. El Alto, the 
<br>sprawling city of mostly poor immigrants that sits on the high 
<br>plain above the city of La Paz, has become a major center of lab 
<br>activity. FELCN La Paz commander Colonel Fernando Amurrio reported 
<br>that FELCN destroyed 133 factories in El Alto during the first 10 
<br>months of the year. Many of these labs are small Colombian-style 
<br>labs hidden inside houses, making them difficult to detect. La Paz 
<br>
<br>is considered a transit point where coca is converted into cocaine 
<br>base paste and cocaine and then shipped to Santa Cruz or other 
<br>areas of Bolivia to be exported. During a series of coordinated 
<br>operations in the Department of La Paz November 20-26, FELCN seized 
<br>93 kilos of cocaine and five tons of marijuana, detained 17 people, 
<br>and seized five vehicles. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. 5. FELCN destroyed two large-scale cocaine factories on 
<br>November 25 in the Sicaya municipality in the Department of 
<br>Cochabamba. FELCN estimated that during their three months of 
<br>operation the factories had produced 180 kilos of cocaine base 
<br>paste, and estimated that they could have produced one ton per year 
<br>if they had remained in operation. The seizures brought the total 
<br>number of seized factories in the region to 12 during the month. 
<br>Cochabamba and MAS deputy Edmundo Novillo noted that increasing 
<br>middle class involvement in coca production and ancillary 
<br>activities, in Cochabamba and Santa Cruz, will require greater GOB 
<br>response. 
<br>
<br>¶6. 
<br>
<br>Growing Community Involvement in Production and Trafficking 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶7. 6. The current rise in the net amount of coca grown and 
<br>cocaine produced in Bolivia has deepened rural community 
<br>involvement in the drug trade, according to numerous NAS contacts 
<br>in FELCN and the GOB's Directorate of Coca Production (DIGPRO 
<br>COCA). Contacts report that drug traffickers pay between $8,000 to 
<br>$10,000 to small rural communities, to buy their cooperation in 
<br>establishing cocaine factories, and then share profits with the 
<br>community to retain acceptance and trust. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶8. 7. In a November 26 operation in the indigenous community 
<br>of Machak Marca de Pocona (in Cochabamba Department), FELCN 
<br>destroyed 32 Colombian-style labs but was able to make only one 
<br>arrest because the entire community fled when tipped off about the 
<br>raid. (Note: Locals in such remote areas can often easily spot 
<br>official vehicles from miles away, due to the lack of vegetation 
<br>and building development. End note.) The local FELCN commander 
<br>expressed his amazement to Bolivian reporters at the degree of 
<br>involvement of the entire community in the production activities. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>CN Police Concerned About Trafficking Via Small Aircraft 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶9. 8. FELCN Director Colonel Oscar Nina told reporters 
<br>November 1 that Bolivia CN forces lack the capacity to detect the 
<br>high and rising number of small aircraft that transport drugs to 
<br>neighboring countries. Nina explained that FELCN lacks radar or 
<br>other technological equipment to confront the problem. Vice 
<br>Minister of Social Defense Felipe Caceres told reporters November 9 
<br>that the GOB's "weakness" in its war against drugs was on the 
<br>country's borders. Caceres noted that President Morales had 
<br>instructed the Defense Minister to work on acquiring additional 
<br>
<br>planes, helicopters and radars to close this gap. (Many of our 
<br>Bolivian CN contacts in the Department of Santa Cruz have told us 
<br>frequently that Bolivia's lack of control over its airspace results 
<br>in near free rein for air trafficking. Sources tell us that 175 
<br>suspicious flights were tracked by Brazilian government mobile 
<br>radar on the border between Bolivia and Brazil in a two-month 
<br>period last fall.) 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Involvement of Foreign Drug Cartels 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶10. 9. Bolivian press reported extensively on FELCN Commander 
<br>General Oscar Nina's October 28 statement that Mexican drug cartels 
<br>are investing in cocaine manufacturing in Bolivia to secure 
<br>sufficient supply to satisfy market demand. Nina stated that 
<br>Mexicans employ Colombian drug mafias, which in turn hire local 
<br>drug gangs. He also stated that Colombians have taken the place of 
<br>Peruvians, who until recently dominated the Bolivian cocaine 
<br>market. 
<br>
<br>¶11. 
<br>
<br>¶12. 10. The District Prosecutor's Office in Santa Cruz recently 
<br>expressed concern about the presence of foreign assassins who are 
<br>hired by drug traffickers to commit murders in Bolivia. 
<br>Anti-corruption Special Prosecutor Alex Oswaldo Cespedes told 
<br>reporters November 16 that seven people had been killed in Santa 
<br>Cruz over the preceding 59 days, and that he believed foreign 
<br>assassins ("sicarios") bore responsibility. Cespedes said that a 
<br>major increase in drug trafficking activities in the city had made 
<br>conditions ripe for the creation of drug trafficking organizations. 
<br>The commander of Bolivia's Special Anti-Crime Police Force, Colonel 
<br>Miguel Gonzalez, said it is too early to conclude that foreign 
<br>assassins were involved. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Increase in Coca Cultivation 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶13. 11. The GOB announced December 9 that coca cultivation had 
<br>increased 6% in 2009 compared to the prior year, or by roughly 
<br>1,830 hectares. Vice Minister of Social Defense Felipe Caceres 
<br>told NAS Director that the two main national parks have more than 
<br>2,000 hectares of illegal coca - 1,081 hectares in Isiboro-Secure 
<br>and 972 hectares in Carrasco. He said the GOB knows it will have 
<br>to resort to forced eradication in 2010, noting that many cocaleros 
<br>do not respect the limits on cultivation set by the GOB. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Coca Union Says Much Coca Circumvents Legal Markets 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶14. 12. The Yungas Coca Producers' Association (ADEPCOCA), the 
<br>union formed by 30,000 coca growers from twelve provinces of Los 
<br>Yungas, released a report on November 10 that stated that of the 
<br>16,127 metric tons of coca leaf grown annually in the Yungas, only 
<br>
<br>4,887 metric tons (30 percent) arrives at the legal coca market in 
<br>Villa Fatima in La Paz. The destination of the remaining 11,240 
<br>metric tons is unknown, according to the report. The ADEPCOCA 
<br>report also stated that of the 54,000 metric tons of coca grown 
<br>nationwide each year, only 21,778 metric tons (40 percent) reaches 
<br>the two legally sanctioned markets -- Villa Fatima in La Paz and 
<br>Sacaba in Cochabamba. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Lobbying For A New Legal Coca Marketplace 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶15. 13. Coca growers of the Munecas Province in the Department of 
<br>La Paz presented to Congress a draft bill to create a new legal 
<br>coca market in the city of El Alto, next to La Paz, and branches in 
<br>La Paz and Cochabamba. Currently, there are two legal markets - 
<br>Villa Fatima in Los Yungas and Sacaba in Cochabamba. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Bolivians Polled On Views Of Coca Situation 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶16. 14. Equipos Mori conducted a November poll in Bolivia's nine 
<br>departments that found: 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>* 60% of Bolivians believe that coca cultivation has 
<br>increased since Evo Morales became President; 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>* 75% believe coca eradication should continue; 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>* 61% believe that there should be additional government 
<br>control over coca production; and 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>* 55% believe the state should control production and 
<br>commercialization of coca. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶17. 15. Comment: It may not be surprising that many Bolivians are 
<br>concerned about coca expansion and support eradication. Those 
<br>directly involved in coca production are a relatively small, but 
<br>influential, percentage of the overall Bolivian population. There 
<br>are approximately 44,000 families in the Chapare (an average of 
<br>five people per family) that are directly involved in growing coca, 
<br>and 26,000 families in the Yungas (an average of four people per 
<br>family). The total Bolivian population is approximately 9 million.
