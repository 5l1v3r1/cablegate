<br>
<br>
<br>Classified By: Charge d'Affaires Todd Chapman for reasons 1.4 (b+d) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) SUMMARY: The Charge recently met with XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>--("the source") who described his frustrations with FRELIMO, President
<br>Guebuza, and Mohamed Bashir Suleiman (MBS). He complained that
<br>they exercise  complete control over the licit and illicit economy of 
<br>Mozambique. The source, who has excellent connections within 
<br>the Government of Mozambique (GRM), including the private  number
<br>of the President, as well as a personal relationship  with MBS,
<br>said "I do not want to do business anymore in Mozambique
<br>“ because of this triumverate of control. He is liquidating his
<br>assets and leaving Mozambique, and says that he now sees
<br>the "malaise" in Mozambique as if "he had cataracts
<br> but now see it all." 
<br>¶2. (S/NF) The source describes President Guebuza, who he 
<br>has known and befriended for the past twenty years as a 
<br>"vicious scorpion who will sting you," and has an even more 
<br>grav assessment of MBS. He cautions that FRELIMO is not 
<br>interested in bettering the life of Mozambique's citizens, 
<br>but rather its self-enrichment. In the licit economy, the 
<br>ruling party, FRELIMO, and MBS work in tandem to control the 
<br>legal and illegal economies and restrict the space for 
<br>private sector growth by demanding a cut of all significant 
<br>business transactions. In the illicit economy, MBS dominates 
<br>money laundering and drug transshipment, providing kickbacks 
<br>to FRELIMO. Other key players involved in pressuring the 
<br>business community for bribes or percentage stakes, according 
<br>to the source, are Domingos Tivane, head of Customs, and 
<br>former Prime Minister Luisa Diogo. END SUMMARY. 
<br>----------------------------------- 
<br>MOHAMED BASHIR SULEIMAN AND GUEBUZA 
<br>----------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) The source XXXXXXXXXXXX. He speculated that 
<br>over the next  term Guebuza would use his business proxies
<br>to amass a still larger personal fortune. Guebuza manages his 
<br>business interests through several front companies, including 
<br>Celso Ismael Correia's Insitec and Salimo Abdullah's Intelec 
<br>Holdings. The source said that MBS meets directly with 
<br>President Guebuza, who has direct knowledge of MBS' funding 
<br>to both the FRELIMO party (underwriting the recent election 
<br>campaign) and Guebuza's front companies. The source, who 
<br>described Correia as a "30 year-old pipsqueak," stated that 
<br>Correia has no business experience or university degree, but 
<br>shows great loyalty to Guebuza. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Guebuza's business interests in Mozambique are 
<br>legion. They include stakes in Mocambique Gestores (MG), 
<br>Maputo Port Development Company (MPDC) which runs Maputo 
<br>Port, Focus 21, Navique, Vodacom, and SASOL. Guebuza also 
<br>has a share in Maputo Corridor Logistics Initiative (MCLI) 
<br>which controls the toll road from Maputo to South Africa, 
<br>according to the source. Guebuza has shares in a significant 
<br>number of banks, including BCI Fomento (where Correia is 
<br>Chairman), Mocambique Capitais, Moza Banco, and Geocapital. 
<br>Through family members, Guebuza also controls Intelec 
<br>Business Advisory and Consulting, Beira Grain Terminal, MBT 
<br>Construction Ltd, Englob Consultants Ltd, Mozambique Power 
<br>Industries, Macequece Ltd, and Mozambique Natural Resources 
<br>Corp. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) One new area that Guebuza appears to be 
<br>interested in is the gaming industry. The source says that 
<br>Guebuza forced the Constitutional Council (CC) to review and 
<br>declare a recent law liberalizing the gaming industry as 
<br>"constitutional" even though it calls for all casino assets 
<br>to revert to the state after a defined period of time, in 
<br>direct contravention of private property laws enshrined in 
<br>the Constitution. The judges of the CC, who also ruled in 
<br>favor of decisions during the elections to invalidate large 
<br>numbers of opposition candidates in the legislative and 
<br>presidential races, complained of the unconstitutionality of 
<br>the new law, but were told to give it a favorable ruling, 
<br>which they did. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) The source elaborated on the depth of Guebuza's 
<br>business interests, which range across the economy. He said 
<br>
<br>MAPUTO 00000086 002.2 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>that Guebuza is in on almost all of the "mega-project" 
<br>multi-million dollar deals via contractual stipulations to 
<br>work with the Mozambican private sector. One example is 
<br>Guebuza's involvement in the 2007 purchase of Cahora Bassa 
<br>Hydroelectric Dam (HCB) from the Portuguese Government for 
<br>$950 million. $700 million of this was paid by a private 
<br>consortium of banks, which was arranged by a Guebuza proxy, 
<br>for which Guebuza received, while he was a sitting president, 
<br>an estimated commission of between $35 and $50 million. The 
<br>Portuguese bank which arranged the financing turned over its 
<br>shares in BCI Fomento, one of the largest Mozambican 
<br>commercial banks, to a Guebuza-controlled company. 
<br>
<br>--------------- 
<br>MBS AND FRELIMO 
<br>--------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S/NF) The source, says that FRELIMO brazenly squeezes 
<br>the business community for kickbacks. As an example, the 
<br>source said that he has personally seen Manuel Tome, former 
<br>FRELIMO Secretary General, senior member of the National 
<br>Assembly, and relative of President Chissano, in MBS' office 
<br>receiving pay-offs quite openly. Head of Customs Domingos 
<br>Tivane openly demands and receives payoffs from importers, 
<br>including MBS. The source stated that one business contact 
<br>remarked to him that when visiting Tivane's expansive home to 
<br>deliver a bribe he noticed that the bureaucrat had solid gold 
<br>fixtures in his bathroom. The source also stated that former 
<br>Prime Minister Luisa Diogo, until she was removed from the 
<br>Cabinet (septel), was heavily involved in taking bribes for 
<br>FRELIMO, of which she kept a percentage. Similar allegations 
<br>were raised in the 21 January issue of Zambeze, regarding 
<br>soft loans paid to Diogo's husband Albano Silva, purchases of 
<br>houses and buildings for a fraction of their value, as well 
<br>as Diogo's close ties to officials such as Diodino Cambaza, 
<br>whose corruption trial is ongoing. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (S/NF) At the ports, the source commented that FRELIMO 
<br>has its own clearing agent that handles FRELIMO and MBS 
<br>business. The clearing agent chronically under-invoices 
<br>items, avoids the 17% VAT, and also has an arrangement with 
<br>Tivane's Customs authorities to bypass the ports' mandatory 
<br>scanning. The source has documentary proof of the 
<br>under-invoicing by MBS, and poloff has seen MBS' trucks drive 
<br>through the port without being scanned. Nonetheless, the 
<br>source said that Government of Mozambique (GRM) officials 
<br>routinely describe MBS as an "untouchable" due to his 
<br>connections to Tivane and Guebuza, a situation which is 
<br>reported to irk a cash-strapped Tax Authority (AT) President 
<br>Rosario Fernandes. 
<br>
<br>------------------------- 
<br>MBS AND OTHER BUSINESSMEN 
<br>------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶9. (S/NF) Regarding MBS' retail operation, the source 
<br>states that MBS does not tolerate competition. The source's 
<br>milk processing facility was threatened by MBS who used 
<br>VAT-avoidance and under-invoicing to dump vast quantities of 
<br>imported condensed milk on the market in order to put the 
<br>source out of business. Only after the source made an 
<br>agreement with MBS for exclusive distribution of his milk 
<br>products, with a 10% kickback on all sales to MBS, did MBS 
<br>stop his dumping practices. Other businessmen have 
<br>complained about similar practices in other commodities to 
<br>include edible oil. The source complained that "even those 
<br>who bribe" MBS or FRELIMO cannot make a profit under such 
<br>conditions. 
<br>
<br>------------------------------ 
<br>NARCOTICS AND MONEY LAUNDERING 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶10. (S/NF) The source says he only has second hand 
<br>knowledge of drug trafficking and money laundering in 
<br>Mozambique. He said that "MBS and the 'Nacala dealers' all 
<br>have offices in Dubai" to facilitate money laundering 
<br>operations in Mozambique. It is through these operations 
<br>that after 15 years in business in Mozambique, MBS was able 
<br>to pay $30 million in cash to establish his shopping plaza 
<br>downtown, Maputo Shopping, which opened in 2007. The source 
<br>said that he asked prominent Ismaili/Aga Khan businessman 
<br>Mustaque Ali how MBS became so rich so fast, and Ali's wry 
<br>answer was "Johnson's baby powder," a euphemism for drugs. 
<br>The source noted that the sometimes erratic changes in 
<br>
<br>MAPUTO 00000086 003.2 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>Mozambique's foreign exchange position are due to sudden 
<br>multi-million dollar transfers of cash overseas tied to money 
<br>laundering. The source commented that in the past few years 
<br>there have been several embarrassing situations in which 
<br>shiploads of drugs, primarily hashish and heroin have washed 
<br>ashore; however, the media is usually afraid to report on 
<br>such incidents because no one wants to become another Carlos 
<br>Cardoso, the courageous Mozambican journalist who was 
<br>murdered in 2000 while investigating a massive bank fraud 
<br>tied to then-President Chissano's family. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br>COMMENT: CANDID COMMENTS FROM A CONNECTED MAN 
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶11. (S/NF) The source, XXXXXXXXXXXX While he has an axe to 
<br>grind because he is frustrated with the scope and depth of 
<br>corruption in Mozambique, his statements corroborate what we 
<br>have learned from other sources (Ref A). Ties with MBS and 
<br>other known money launders and narcotraffickers by senior GRM 
<br>officials are disturbing and demonstrate a short-sighted 
<br>focus on self-enrichment. The source cautions against 
<br>building long term relationships with FRELIMO, and fears 
<br>that, having allowed the illicit economy to prosper, and 
<br>having advertised Mozambique as a money laundering 
<br>destination and drug transshipment hotspot, the ruling party 
<br>will no longer be able to control the nefarious activities 
<br>within its borders. Rumors and stories of corruption abound 
<br>in Mozambique, but rarely will a successful well-connected 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX be willing to share specific practices based 
<br>on first-hand knowledge and participation in these practices.
