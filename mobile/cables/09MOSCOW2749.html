<br>E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/05/2019
<br>TAGS: KJUS PINS PREL PTER SOCI RS
<br>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR VISIT OF FBI DIRECTOR MUELLER TO
<br>MOSCOW, NOVEMBER 15-17, 2009
<br>
<br>Classified By: AMBASSADOR JOHN BEYRLE, REASONS 1.4 (B), (C), (D), AND (
<br>F)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary. Director Mueller: Your engagement with
<br>Russia's top law enforcement and security service officials
<br>is a tangible sign that U.S.-Russian relations are improving
<br>markedly after hitting bottom in the summer of 2008. Recent
<br>visits by President Obama and Secretary Clinton have
<br>demonstrated to the Russians that we take their concerns
<br>seriously and have produced more positive momentum in our
<br>bilateral ties than I have seen in over a decade. The
<br>Bilateral Presidential Commission (BPC) will play a key role
<br>in building confidence and giving us regular contact with key
<br>elements of the GOR bureaucracy, including the often
<br>obstructionist law-enforcement organs. The BPC can
<br>strengthen joint efforts to combat terrorism, organized crime
<br>and other shared concerns.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Summary continued. You should harbor no illusions
<br>about your counterparts: FSB Director Aleksandr Bortnikov,
<br>SVR Director Mikhail Fradkov, and Internal Affairs Minister
<br>Rashid Nurgaliyev represent institutions that feel threatened
<br>-- ideologically and materially -- by the "reset" in our
<br>relations. At the same time, they appreciate the benefits
<br>that cooperation with the U.S. provides, not only in
<br>achieving their assigned missions, but also in enhancing
<br>their country's position internationally. End Summary.
<br>
<br>Domestic Political Context
<br>--------------------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) After almost two years of tandem leadership, President
<br>Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin govern based on a
<br>still-evolving division of labor. Medvedev, the junior
<br>partner, has been a steady advocate of modernization --
<br>economic, political and technological. Constitutionally, he
<br>has the lead in foreign policy, but makes no major decisions
<br>without some form of consultation with Putin, most of which
<br>is obscure to the outside world. In addition to governing
<br>behind the scenes, Putin has been visible in tackling recent
<br>crises such as the conflict with Georgia, gas supply
<br>negotiations with Ukraine, and localized unrest due to the
<br>economic crisis. Although there is evidence that their
<br>closest advisors spar privately over policies and personnel
<br>matters, the two leaders appear united and project complete
<br>ease with one another in the media. Medvedev has yet to make
<br>major changes to the senior staff he inherited from Putin.
<br>Putin remains more popular than Medvedev.
<br>
<br>Three Skeptics
<br>--------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Russia's recent economic problems and uncertainty
<br>about the future of the Medvedev-Putin "tandem" have
<br>reinforced long-standing elite divisions between the
<br>"siloviki" (officials from the security and intelligence
<br>services) and the modernizers. Your interlocutors are leading
<br>representatives of the siloviki; they are Putin proteges who
<br>believe a strong state exercising effective political and
<br>economic control is the answer to most problems. They
<br>advocate tightening the screws against domestic opposition
<br>and their alleged external supporters -- principally the U.S.
<br>and its Western allies. The modernizers recognize that
<br>Russia's future depends on integration with the world economy
<br>and that confronting some of the country's most stubborn
<br>problems -- such as corruption -- requires transparency and
<br>the impartial application of the law.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) The security services are skeptical about the West's
<br>motivations and are the most influential opponents of the
<br>engagement agenda. Bortnikov, Fradkov, and Nurgaliyev tend
<br>toward a Cold War mentality, which sees the U.S. and its
<br>allies intent on undermining Russia -- and they have made
<br>public accusations to that effect. None of them is within the
<br>"inner circle" of Kremlin decision-making, but instead enjoy
<br>the reflected power of their sponsors and allies. According
<br>to one expert, Fradkov and Bortnikov share a background in
<br>dealing with economic issues -- working behind the scenes to
<br>check the influence of Russia's powerful business magnates
<br>and advance the interests of their allies. Fradkov, a former
<br>prime minister under Putin who allegedly worked for Soviet
<br>intelligence in the 1970s in brokering arms sales to India,
<br>has a mandate to protect the interests of Russian companies
<br>abroad. Fradkov works closely with the powerful state
<br>corporations and has ties to the influential First Deputy
<br>Prime Minister Igor Sechin. Bortnikov spent his entire career
<br>in the FSB working on economic issues, including a stint as
<br>head of the FSB Economic Security Service. In that role
<br>
<br>Bortnikov worked on the government's campaign against the
<br>oligarchs. Many consider Bortnikov as the protege of his
<br>predecessor, Nikolay Patrushev, now the Secretary of the
<br>Security Council, and also indirectly allied with Sechin. Of
<br>the three, only Fradkov has any real experience in foreign
<br>relations gained during his tenure as Russian Ambassador to
<br>the EU from 2003-2004 and his work in the Ministry of Foreign
<br>Trade during the 1990s.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Nevertheless, there are indications that they value
<br>work with other services on specific issues of mutual
<br>interest. Perhaps most telling, Nurgaliyev has supported
<br>cooperative relationships with his counterparts around the
<br>globe, demonstrated by his personal efforts to secure an
<br>INTERPOL training center in Moscow, and he has been a good
<br>partner for the U.S. in its efforts to protect intellectual
<br>property rights. Moreover, Nurgaliyev has openly lamented the
<br>culture of corruption with Russia's law enforcement system
<br>and has been a strong supporter of Medvedev's well-publicized
<br>campaign against corruption.
<br>
<br>State Security
<br>--------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Despite the changes since the collapse of the Soviet
<br>Union, Russia's security services more closely resemble the
<br>model of the Czarist-era Okhrana (secret police) than Western
<br>law-enforcement institutions. State security remains the
<br>services' primary responsibility and all three organizations
<br>devote considerable attention and resources to
<br>counter-intelligence and domestic intelligence work. While
<br>the FSB and MVD nominally share the FBI's responsibilities --
<br>criminal prosecution, organized crime, and counter-terrorism
<br>-- they are also fully immersed in Russia's political
<br>battles. Political factors determine the services'
<br>enthusiasm for pursuing investigations and independent
<br>analysts believe individuals within the security services are
<br>linked with organized crime.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Russian security service leaders play a far more open
<br>political role than their counterparts in the West. Your
<br>three interlocutors accrue political power in the Russian
<br>system by using the legal system against political enemies --
<br>turning the courts into weapons of political warfare rather
<br>than independent arbiters. They control large numbers of men
<br>and resources -- the MVD alone has more than 190,000 soldiers
<br>in its internal security divisions. Despite their similar
<br>outlook and background, they are often competitors for
<br>influence against each other -- with shadowy conflicts
<br>occasionally bubbling to the surface.
<br>
<br>Regional Unrest
<br>---------------
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) After the "color" revolutions in Georgia and Ukraine,
<br>Russian security services stepped up their efforts against
<br>the U.S. and other Western powers, whom they blame for
<br>inciting the protests and overthrowing the governments in
<br>Tbilisi and Kyiv. Their officers maintain constant vigilance
<br>against the U.S. government representatives through active
<br>surveillance and they have sought to stifle U.S. humanitarian
<br>programs in the North Caucasus. MVD forces harass and
<br>intimidate political opposition protests while
<br>"investigations" against Western-supported NGOs for trumped
<br>up charges (like using pirated software) have hindered the
<br>work that those organizations seek to accomplish.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Concern about potential social unrest associated with
<br>the recent economic crisis provided justification for the
<br>security services' push earlier this year to eliminate jury
<br>trials and to broaden the definition of "treason" to include
<br>the organization of protests against the government; the
<br>former became a law, while Medvedev withdrew the treason law
<br>for revision. In December, the MVD deployed special "OMON"
<br>forces in Vladivostok against demonstrators protesting new
<br>taxes on imported automobiles, key economic sector in that
<br>region. They have shelved plans to reduce the number of MVD
<br>internal troops, ostensibly to retain a security force for
<br>the 2014 Olympic Games in Sochi.
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) The marked deterioration of security in the North
<br>Caucasus over the past three months has alarmed regional and
<br>national leaders. The car bomb that nearly killed Yunus-bek
<br>Yevkurov, President of the Republic of Ingushetia, has
<br>dampened the initial optimism that Yevkurov could bring
<br>ethnic and religious groups together. The continued threat of
<br>separatism, extremism, and terrorism -- particularly in the
<br>North Caucasus -- is a priority issue for the security
<br>
<br>services. Ethnic conflict and social unrest continue to
<br>simmer in Ingushetia, Dagestan, and other republics in the
<br>troubled Caucasus region. The MVD has more than 15,000
<br>soldiers stationed in Chechnya, an additional regiment in
<br>Ingushetia, and has created three "special forces" (spetznaz)
<br>counter-terrorism units in Moscow, Smolensk, and Chelyabinsk.
<br>
<br>A Challenging Relationship
<br>--------------------------
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) While portions of the FSB are working cooperatively
<br>with US law enforcement, some sections, particularly those
<br>dealing with counterintelligence, are not. Harassing
<br>activity against all embassy personnel has spiked in the past
<br>several months to a level not seen in many years. Embassy
<br>personnel have suffered personally slanderous and falsely
<br>prurient attacks in the media. Family members have been the
<br>victims of psychologically terrifying assertions that their
<br>USG employee spouses had met accidental deaths. Home
<br>intrusions have become far more commonplace and bold, and
<br>activity against our locally engaged Russian staff continues
<br>at a record pace. We have no doubt that this activity
<br>originates in the FSB. Counterintelligence challenges remain
<br>a hallmark of service at Embassy Moscow. This fact is
<br>unlikely to change in the medium term.
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Despite the challenges of working with our Russian
<br>counterparts, your visit takes place in the context of strong
<br>Kremlin backing and a climate of renewed opportunity. Since
<br>your 2004 trip to Russia, the success of joint investigation
<br>programs with the MVD and FSB on organized crime,
<br>counter-terrorism, and cybercrime has demonstrated the
<br>potential gains that a cooperative relationship can provide.
<br>It is premature to say we have reached a turning point in
<br>overcoming security service suspicions about U.S. intentions,
<br>but the vigor in which the FSB has pursued your visit
<br>(including covering the cost of the over flight and airport
<br>landing fees) shows a definite thaw after last year's war in
<br>Georgia. At a minimum, we can expect the Russian side to
<br>welcome your continued advocacy for the Joint FBI-MVD working
<br>group on organized crime, efforts to work together to fight
<br>cybercrime, and other cooperative projects. We also expect
<br>them to be receptive to a renewed invitation for a law
<br>enforcement officer to attend the FBI's National Academy at
<br>Quantico.
