<br>
<br>
<br>Classified By: Charge d'Affaires Hugo Llorens for Reasons 1.4 (B) and (
<br>D)
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) SUMMARY. In order to confront the sustained
<br>terrorist threat to the United States and our European
<br>allies, we must find innovative, flexible and proactive
<br>approaches to strengthen the effectiveness of international
<br>cooperation in the fight against terrorism. My Mission
<br>inter-agency team has held extensive discussions of
<br>prevailing threat levels in Europe and Spain's role in the
<br>collective security scheme of Europe and the western
<br>Mediterranean and believes that the creation of a
<br>counterterrorism and law enforcement hub in Barcelona would
<br>significantly bolster US regional capabilities.
<br>Specifically, we propose that our Consulate General in
<br>Barcelona become the platform for a multi-agency,
<br>jointly-coordinated counterterrorism, anti-crime, and
<br>intelligence center to work with our Spanish hosts in
<br>combating the target-rich environment of terrorist and
<br>criminal activities centered in the region. END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) Spain is a past and current al-Qaeda target and a
<br>critical player in US-EU counterterrorism efforts, due to its
<br>close proximity to the Maghreb and the presence of over 1
<br>million Muslims. Mission Spain's Country Team strategy has
<br>been to develop a two-nation, multi-agency approach to
<br>confront the terrorist threat in all its aspects. We
<br>leverage the human and organizational resources, in addition
<br>to intelligence capabilities, of relevant US and Spanish law
<br>enforcement agencies as we increasingly recognize and combat
<br>the links between terrorist networks and criminals involved
<br>in the contraband of goods, drug trafficking, money
<br>laundering, human smuggling, and document falsification. Our
<br>approach is to maximize our resource allocation by ensuring
<br>that all Mission elements have a role to play in working with
<br>our Spanish hosts in the fight against terror and crime.
<br>
<br>¶3. (U) Barcelona is the capital of the region Catalonia and a
<br>city of approximately 1.6 million people located on the
<br>Mediterranean Sea in northeastern Spain. Situated just below
<br>France's southern border, the inhabitants of Spain's second
<br>city have historically believed themselves to be different
<br>culturally from the rest of Spain; a crossroads of languages,
<br>cultures, and history. Barcelona has become one of Europe's
<br>premier cities (sealed during its successful hosting of the
<br>1992 Summer Olympic Games), but also a haven for illicit
<br>activities that threaten our interests.
<br>
<br>//BARCELONA: PROFILE OF THE RISING THREAT//
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Large Muslim Population Susceptible to Jihadist
<br>Recruitment: As a result of increased monitoring of radical
<br>Islamist activity since the March 11, 2004 train bombings in
<br>Madrid perpetrated by al-Qaeda affiliates in Spain and the
<br>Maghreb, Spanish and US authorities have identified Catalonia
<br>as a major Mediterranean center of radical Islamist activity.
<br>In February 2007, a suspected al-Qaeda operative was
<br>arrested near Barcelona and charged with recruiting new
<br>members for a terrorist cell based in North Africa. Three
<br>months later, authorities detained 11 more suspected Islamist
<br>extremist terrorists in and around Barcelona, including at
<br>least one purported imam. These individuals had false
<br>documents, large sums of cash, and multiple mobile phones,
<br>and Spanish police say their aim was to recruit terrorists
<br>for attacks in Iraq and Afghanistan. Spanish media reported
<br>in July 2007 that the Iraqi terrorist group Ansar al-Islam
<br>had established a recruiting cell in Catalonia to route
<br>would-be suicide bombers through a terrorist pipeline to Iraq.
<br>
<br>
<br>MADRID 00001914 002.2 OF 005
<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Heavy immigration - both legal and illegal - from
<br>North Africa (Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria) and Southeast
<br>Asia (Pakistan and Bangladesh) has made this region a magnet
<br>for terrorist recruiters. The Spanish National Police
<br>estimates that there may be upwards of 60,000 Pakistanis
<br>living in Barcelona and the surrounding area; the vast
<br>majority are male, unmarried or unaccompanied, and without
<br>legal documentation. There are even more such immigrants
<br>from North Africa. Once here, they share a similar fate:
<br>they live on the edges of Spanish society, they do not speak
<br>the language, they are often unemployed, and they have very
<br>few places to practice their religion with dignity.
<br>Individually, these circumstances would provide fertile
<br>ground for terrorist recruitment; taken together, the threat
<br>is clear. In light of recent suspected activity, there is
<br>little doubt that the autonomous region of Catalonia has
<br>become a prime base of operations for terrorist activity.
<br>Spanish authorities tell us they fear the threat from these
<br>atomized immigrant communities prone to radicalism, but they
<br>have very little intelligence on or ability to penetrate
<br>these groups.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Drug Traffickers, Money Launders Gravitate to the
<br>Region: Drug use is on the rise all across Spain, but
<br>particularly in Catalonia. Spain remains the principal entry
<br>and transshipment zone for the large quantities of South
<br>American cocaine, Moroccan cannabis, and Afghan heroin
<br>destined for Spanish and European Union consumer markets.
<br>Spain is also a major source and transit location for drug
<br>proceeds returning to South and Central America. A recent
<br>report by the US Department of the Treasury notes that Spain
<br>is the European base where drug traffickers start the process
<br>of cleansing their cash proceeds. US and Spanish officials
<br>consider Barcelona to be a key operational base for
<br>distribution and financing for Colombia's cocaine cartels.
<br>These drug traffickers view the region as a hospitable
<br>environment and increasingly ply their trade in and around
<br>Barcelona. Spanish authorities are having trouble following
<br>the flow of illegal drugs and laundered money through this
<br>region, but believe that cartels have established
<br>interconnected groups of front companies and continuously
<br>changing bank accounts to pass of drug money as legitimate
<br>earnings. ICE Madrid has conducted several recent
<br>investigations involving money launderers who are conducting
<br>business for the purpose of laundering illicit proceeds in
<br>Catalonia. These individuals represent various ethnic groups
<br>and nationalities, reinforcing the region's magnetic effect
<br>on nefarious activity.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Trafficking in Persons and Illegal Smuggling: Spain
<br>remains both a transit and destination country for
<br>internationally trafficked persons, primarily women
<br>trafficked for prostitution, and we are seeing increasing
<br>incidences of trafficking based in Catalonia. The Department
<br>of Homeland Security reported that the Barcelona airport has
<br>seen an increase in the number of trafficking victims passing
<br>through in recent months. Spanish authorities tell us that
<br>Chinese, Romanian, and Kosovar-Albanian mafias have settled
<br>in Catalonia and spread down the Mediterranean coast in
<br>recent years, and continue to gain strength. These groups
<br>use their military training and criminal expertise to run
<br>prostitution rings, and Spanish authorities do not have a
<br>complete grasp of the entire spectrum of the mafias'
<br>activities. ICE Madrid has worked closely with the Spanish
<br>National Police to disrupt a child pornography ring run by a
<br>Russian criminal organization based in Catalonia.
<br>
<br>¶8. (S/NF) Organized Crime and Counterfeiting: The Spanish
<br>government is at the forefront of European and global efforts
<br>
<br>MADRID 00001914 003.2 OF 005
<br>
<br>
<br>to combat organized crime. Major crime groups made up of
<br>Russians, Ukrainians, and Lithuanians have set up shop along
<br>Spain's eastern coast; including Barcelona, Tarragona, and
<br>Valencia. Most Chinese organized crime is located in
<br>Barcelona, and to a lesser extent Valencia. Spanish
<br>authorities have had a string of operational successes
<br>against some of these groups, but remain challenged to cope
<br>with the magnitude of the problem, and key organized crime
<br>figures and groups continue to operate in Spain. Counterfeit
<br>euro and US dollar bills are increasingly manufactured in and
<br>passed through Spain. Catalonia, the Balearic Islands, and
<br>nearby Andorra are prime areas for this illicit movement.
<br>More than 25% of the EU's 500-euro notes are found along
<br>Spain's eastern coast, where they are presumably used in
<br>large-scale drug and money transactions. In addition, our
<br>Mission agencies have to focus more on credit card fraud
<br>perpetrated by a web of diversified criminal organizations,
<br>often comprised of immigrant communities in Catalonia.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Port Security: The Container Security Initiative
<br>(CSI) team is at full strength and working with Port of
<br>Barcelona officials to screen US-bound shipments before they
<br>leave port. The port is one of Europe's busiest,
<br>facilitating shipping throughout the Mediterranean. In June
<br>2007, CSI Algeciras seized a large shipment of weapons (many
<br>of them stolen and with their serial numbers scratched off),
<br>reportedly destined for Nicaragua by way of Puerto Rico.
<br>Spanish authorities recently have seized many cocaine-laden
<br>containers in the Port of Barcelona. Our CSI colleagues
<br>believe the seaports along Spain's eastern Mediterranean
<br>coastline will see an increase in the amount of cargo passing
<br>through, and US and Spanish authorities will be further
<br>challenged to detect illegal contraband.
<br>
<br>//LEVERAGING SUBSTANTIAL SPANISH ASSETS//
<br>
<br>¶10. (S/NF) The presence of a highly professional inter-agency
<br>team working out of our Consulate General in Barcelona would
<br>help leverage the substantial resources and expertise of
<br>Spanish and regional authorities in a more focused campaign,
<br>and serve as a force multiplier for our joint fight. The hub
<br>concept can also serve as a potential model of how we can
<br>work with our European allies in common purpose on law
<br>enforcement, security, and intelligence initiatives away from
<br>the more bureaucratic and politicized world of capital
<br>cities. Certainly, the Spanish government has been focused
<br>on terrorism for almost 40 years due to its struggles against
<br>the Basque terrorist group ETA. Since March 11, 2004, Spain
<br>has also actively worked to counter the threat from Islamic
<br>extremism. The Spanish political class is gradually waking
<br>up to the amorphous threat represented by the nexus of
<br>terrorism, crime, and drug trafficking, and would likely look
<br>favorably on our proposal. On a regional and local level,
<br>Catalan security forces have substantial capabilities and
<br>would welcome the opportunity to increase the depth and
<br>breadth of CT and law enforcement cooperation with the US.
<br>However, we would have to carefully broach this hub concept
<br>with the central Spanish government, who may be wary of
<br>ceding more authority and responsibility to Catalonia. CG
<br>Barcelona has maintained excellent contacts with the Spanish
<br>National Police, Civil Guard, Mossos d'Esquadra (Catalan
<br>security force) and Barcelona Police, but these contacts
<br>could and should be put to better use by the on-the-ground
<br>presence of the agencies with greater experience that could
<br>dedicate more focused day-to-day interaction with the key
<br>players in the region. Embassy Madrid has established
<br>extensive bilateral contact with the Spanish government on
<br>issues of counterterrorism and law enforcement, but the USG
<br>now needs a regional approach that extends our focus and
<br>
<br>MADRID 00001914 004.2 OF 005
<br>
<br>
<br>reach into the entire western Mediterranean.
<br>
<br>
<br>//OUR PROPOSAL//
<br>
<br>¶11. (S/NF) Under the direction of the Deputy Chief of
<br>Mission and co-coordinated with the CG Barcelona, we reached
<br>out to the relevant agencies and sections in Mission Spain
<br>and came to agreement on the minimal structure and level of
<br>resources needed to get the hub up and running and provide
<br>the basis of an effective multi-agency and
<br>jointly-coordinated center. As this concept moves forward,
<br>we will fine tune staffing as required. We also will analyze
<br>ways to pool ICASS resources between the USG agencies
<br>represented to minimize the number of support staff needed.
<br>The Principal Officer in Barcelona would lead the center and
<br>would report to the Ambassador through the DCM. Each
<br>Assistant Attache would also report to their respective
<br>agency and section heads in Madrid, who would maintain
<br>traditional contact with their home agency headquarters in
<br>Washington.
<br>
<br>LEGAT - Assistant Legal Attache and one OMS support staff.
<br>The ALAT would focus liaison efforts with the Mossos
<br>d'Esquadra, who have the most significant law enforcement
<br>presence in the region. This ALAT would enhance the
<br>effectiveness of the Madrid LEGAT office, coordinating
<br>operations in the Catalonia region. The FBI's regional
<br>responsibilities would include counterterrorism, cyber-based
<br>attacks and high technology crimes, transnational organized
<br>crime as well as law enforcement training.
<br>
<br>ICE/CBP/CSI - Assistant ICE/CBP Attache, who would serve as
<br>the senior DHS representative in the consular district and
<br>would supervise CSI operations in Barcelona and Valencia. In
<br>addition, the representative would work with TSA to monitor
<br>flights departing Barcelona for the US.
<br>
<br>GRPO - One senior officer to work directly with Spanish
<br>counterparts in Barcelona and the surrounding area, and
<br>possibly one additional officer in a support capacity.
<br>
<br>DEA - A Regional Agent in Charge (RAC) plus one special agent
<br>to provide expertise and assistance to foreign agencies on
<br>narcotics and dangerous drug enforcement and control
<br>programs. The RAC would also participate in investigations
<br>of international illicit drug trafficking and would develop
<br>and report on tactical and strategic intelligence.
<br>
<br>USSS - Assistant Attache to work counterfeit US currency,
<br>credit card fraud, cyber crimes and traditional protective
<br>duties. Additionally, the Attache would assist other law
<br>enforcement agencies by coordinating financial crimes
<br>intelligence information available to them through our
<br>relationships with local and regional financial institutions.
<br>
<br>ICASS/Management/PAO - One associate management officer, one
<br>communications officer, and one LES support. The Public
<br>Affairs Officer in Barcelona would deal primarily with
<br>hub-related activities and strengthen our engagement with
<br>local Muslim communities to help counter the extremist
<br>messages reaching susceptible audiences.
<br>
<br>RSO - One RSO, one OMS, and one LES investigator to work as
<br>senior security staff for the consulate, represent the lead
<br>agency on visa and passport fraud, and assist the American
<br>Citizen Services unit with US victims of crime. The RSO
<br>would also direct residential security, law enforcement
<br>liaison, and local guard programs in Barcelona and monitor
<br>
<br>MADRID 00001914 005.2 OF 005
<br>
<br>
<br>the proper storage of classified information. The LES
<br>investigator would maintain liaison with all local and
<br>regional forces on matters related to Mission security.
<br>
<br>
<br>//WHY THE CONSULATE?//
<br>
<br>¶12. (S/NF) The threat in Catalonia is clear. Barcelona has
<br>become a crossroads of worrisome activities, a natural
<br>meeting place and transit point of people and goods moving to
<br>and through the region from all countries bordering the
<br>western Mediterranean. The US needs an on-site ability to
<br>quickly see who and what is passing through the area from
<br>places such as Algiers, Tunis, Rabat, and the south of
<br>France. The Consulate General in Barcelona would be the
<br>ideal platform for the hub because it has the space
<br>available, secure communications and a prime location.
<br>
<br>¶13. (S/NF) COMMENT: The hub concept is a field-driven
<br>strategic proposal to counter, disrupt, and eliminate
<br>terrorist and organized crime networks that cross national
<br>borders by breaking down regional stovepipes within USG
<br>departments and agencies. This center would also build host
<br>nation cooperation and capacity to address transnational
<br>threats, focusing on the entire western Mediterranean region.
<br>Catalonia has become a key theater of operation for those
<br>who would threaten our interests and national security, and
<br>the complex and evolving threat requires flexible interaction
<br>among the entire Country Team; a challenge that the hub would
<br>meet head-on. END COMMENT.
