<br>SUMMARY 
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) Secretary of State for Telecommunications and the 
<br>Information Society Francisco Ros told Econoffs at an October 
<br>6 AmCham breakfast that "within a matter of days," the GOS 
<br>will announce a series of measures designed to tackle 
<br>Internet piracy. The President of the Coalition of Creators 
<br>and Content Industries reported separately that the Coalition 
<br>may reach a "de minimis" agreement with the association of 
<br>Internet Service Providers (Redtel) in the next week or two, 
<br>leading to a government initiative. In his formal remarks at 
<br>the breakfast, Ros briefly addressed IPR issues, 
<br>characterizing the assertion by copyright-dependent 
<br>industries that Spain has one of the highest Internet piracy 
<br>rates in the world as an "urban legend." USG officials and 
<br>U.S.-based industry representatives will have an opportunity 
<br>during Ros's October 19-22 visit to Washington to challenge 
<br>this view. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) On October 6, State Secretary (Under Secretary 
<br>equivalent) Francisco Ros addressed an audience of about 80 
<br>at an AmCham-hosted breakfast, speaking on "The Development 
<br>of the Information Society in Boosting U.S.-Spain relations." 
<br>Following that event, he met with the AmCham's Intellectual 
<br>Property Committee, composed of representatives of the 
<br>software, film, music, and video games industries. 
<br>
<br>A DEAL IMMINENT? 
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) In a conversation with Econoffs before the event 
<br>began, State Secretary Ros, who is scheduled to visit 
<br>Washington November 19-22, said that the government will 
<br>announce a new initiative related to IPR protection and 
<br>Internet piracy "in a matter of days." Econoffs later spoke 
<br>to Aldo Olcese, President of the Coalition of Creators and 
<br>Content Providers, who confirmed that the government was 
<br>putting considerable pressure on Redtel, the ISP association, 
<br>to agree to what Olcese characterized as a "de minimis" 
<br>anti-piracy agreement. The Coalition is not enthusiastic 
<br>about the proposed agreement but intends to accept it as a 
<br>way to get the government more actively engaged in finding 
<br>and implementing solutions. Olcese estimated that the first 
<br>part of the agreement, establishing a government authority 
<br>that would take action against a number of high-profile 
<br>websites known to make pirated content available, could be 
<br>ready by the end of this week. The second part, on making 
<br>legal content available online, could, if accepted by Redtel, 
<br>be ready by October 16, he said. 
<br>
<br>REMARKS 
<br>
<br>¶4. (U) In his formal remarks, State Secretary Ros provided 
<br>statistics on the impressive growth in Internet penetration 
<br>in Spain and as well as the strong performance of the IT 
<br>sector in the face of the economic downturn. A major focus 
<br>of his remarks was promotion of the 3rd International Frum on 
<br>Digital Content (FICOD 2009) to be held in Madrid, November 
<br>17-19. The GOS has invited the U.S. to participate in FICOD 
<br>as the featured country ("invitado de honor") and is seeking 
<br>USG and private-sector participation. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (U) Towards the end of his speech, Ros turned briefly to 
<br>IPR issues, commenting that "there are no objective data 
<br>provided by any entity that shows that Spain has more 
<br>Internet piracy than its neighboring countries." He 
<br>characterized assertions by industry that Spain has one of 
<br>the highest Internet piracy rates in the world as an "urban 
<br>legend." He referred to Eurostat figures that he said show 
<br>that Spanish youth share files at about the same volume as 
<br>their peers in the UK, France, and Germany. Nevertheless, he 
<br>said, Spain takes IPR protection seriously and is among the 
<br>first countries to promote collaborative international 
<br>actions to combat the phenomenon. Ros argued that no country 
<br>can solve the piracy problem on its own and that a global 
<br>approach is needed. Spain hopes to develop such an approach 
<br>during its January-June 2010 Presidency of the European 
<br>Union. Meanwhile, he stressed that "putting into place 
<br>measures that don't work" only serves to create false 
<br>expectations that lead to disappointment and frustration. 
<br>
<br>METING WITH AMCHAM IP COMMITTEE 
<br>
<br>¶6. (U) In his subsequent meeting with the AmCham's 
<br>Intellectual Property committee, Ros returned to these 
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000982 002.3 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>themes, averring that Spain's "bad reputation" for piracy 
<br>predates the era of illicit downloads and file-sharing, and 
<br>derives from the street piracy practice known as "top manta," 
<br>in which infringing goods are sold at informal street 
<br>markets, and hidden under blankets when police appear. 
<br>(Note: "Top manta" is still widespread in Spain, but police 
<br>have been increasingly effective in combating it in recent 
<br>years, though there have been calls to decriminalize the 
<br>practice since it is allegedly practiced by impoverished 
<br>immigrants. End Note.) He insisted that the practices and 
<br>habits of Spanish Internet users are no different than those 
<br>of people in other, similar countries. In this context, he 
<br>insinuated that Spain's placement on the Special 301 Watch 
<br>List in 2008 and 2009 was arbitrary and unfair. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (U) Ros said any attempt to reduce online piracy should 
<br>have three components: repression, education, and the 
<br>exploitation of new models to make content legally available 
<br>online. He added that the Spanish government is seeking 
<br>ways, under existing authority, to pursue and take out of 
<br>commission some 100 websites that are responsible for perhaps 
<br>as much as 80 percent of infringing content. Defending the 
<br>Spanish government's IPR performance, he cited figures 
<br>showing the number of cases of Internet piracy pursued by 
<br>police and prosecutors over the past four years, even while 
<br>recognizing that many judges in Spain are not well equipped 
<br>to understand or dispose correctly of intellectual property 
<br>cases. Ros also mentioned public education campaigns Spain 
<br>has undertaking, while noting that content providers needed 
<br>to offer an alternative to illegal downloading and 
<br>file-sharing, using new forms of distribution to make quality 
<br>products available on the Internet at attractive prices. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (U) Ros told the rights-holders' representatives that 
<br>"very soon," Spain's Council of Ministers will receive for 
<br>its approval a proposal for regulatory reform to address 
<br>digital piracy. While not ruling out new legislation to 
<br>strengthen the government's authority, Ros lamented that 
<br>getting a law through Congress could take years and would 
<br>likely arouse bitter opposition. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (U) AmCham President Jaime Malet and various of those 
<br>present told State Secretary Ros that the important point was 
<br>not whether piracy in Spain was worse than in other 
<br>countries, but rather that it was clearly bad enough to merit 
<br>and require forceful government action. In order for content 
<br>providers to invest more in the Spanish market, there needs 
<br>to be an adequate legal and regulatory framework to support 
<br>quality content and make possible a decent return on 
<br>investment. The film and music industries have seen marked 
<br>declines in sales over the past several years, attributable 
<br>to the growth of Internet piracy. Ros claimed that Spain's 
<br>legal and regulatory framework was on a par with those of 
<br>France, Germany, and the UK. 
<br>
<br>COMMENT 
<br>
<br>¶10. (SBU) While not challenging to his face Ros's assertions 
<br>that industry has wrongly stigmatized Spain, a number of 
<br>industry representatives present were clearly incensed with 
<br>his "urban legend" remark and the argument behind it. A 
<br>representative of a local Disney affiliate told Econoff 
<br>afterwards that his company take serious issue with Ros's 
<br>claim that there are no objective data showing Spain's piracy 
<br>problem to be worse than other countries'. Aldo Olcese cited 
<br>the attitude behind Ros's assertions as illustrative of the 
<br>difficulties the Coalition has encountered in trying to get 
<br>the government to act more vigorously against Internet 
<br>piracy. During his visit to Washington, Ros will meet with 
<br>the International Intellectual Proerty Alliance (IIPA) and 
<br>the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), among 
<br>others. These groups will no doubt challenge his denigration 
<br>of their data and his complacent assessment of Spain's 
<br>Internet piracy situation and legal regime. USTR will also 
<br>have the opportunity to help him understand why Spain is on 
<br>the Watch List and what it must do to get off it. The news 
<br>from both Olcese and Ros that an agreement and a government 
<br>initiative are close to fruition is certainly welcome, and 
<br>such an agreement, however modest, would be an important step 
<br>in the right direction.. End Comment.
