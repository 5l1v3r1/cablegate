<br>SUMMARY 
<br>-------- 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) As part of Director of Foreign Assistance and USAID 
<br>Administrator Randall Tobias' visit to Bolivia, President 
<br>Morales met with Tobias, WHA PDAS Charles Shapiro, and 
<br>Ambassador Goldberg early March 2. Morales thanked 
<br>Ambassador Tobias for U.S. natural disaster assistance, 
<br>saying that this year's flooding is the worst Bolivia has 
<br>seen in 60 years. On the bilateral relationship in general, 
<br>Morales said Bolivia wants an "excellent relationship" with 
<br>the United States. Ambassadors Tobias and Shapiro offered 
<br>support for Bolivia's goal of a more inclusive society, but 
<br>Tobias noted that the goal should be placed in the context of 
<br>a democracy that includes all Bolivians. Morales asked for 
<br>aid in creating jobs and improving infrastructure and said he 
<br>has "great interest" in the Millennium Challenge Account 
<br>(MCA) and in an additional ATPDEA extension. Morales 
<br>described Bolivia's many marches and blockades as largely 
<br>local problems and accused opposition party Podemos of 
<br>organizing them and plotting against his government. Morales 
<br>thanked Ambassador Tobias for USAID assistance, highlighting 
<br>alternative development and infrastructure programs in 
<br>particular. Ambassador Tobias noted both countries' interest 
<br>in close counternarcotics cooperation and acknowledged the 
<br>GOB's interdiction efforts; Morales responded by saying his 
<br>government is serious about fighting narcotics trafficking. 
<br>Morales spoke in terms of a net reduction of coca and said 
<br>his government plans to work harder in the Yungas; he also 
<br>stressed the GOB's desire for closer counternarcotics 
<br>cooperation with the United States. In an unprecedented move, 
<br>Morales joined Tobias for a joint press conference following 
<br>the meeting and publicly thanked the USG for disaster 
<br>assistance and general cooperation. In perhaps the Embassy's 
<br>most positive meeting with Morales to date, the president 
<br>repeatedly thanked Tobias (both privately and publicly) for 
<br>U.S. assistance and seemed to appreciate the finer points of 
<br>USAID operations in Bolivia. End summary. 
<br>
<br>------------------- 
<br>DISASTER ASSISTANCE 
<br>------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) As part of Director of Foreign Assistance and USAID 
<br>Administrator Randall Tobias' visit to Bolivia, President 
<br>Morales (along with Amcit MFA trade advisor Tom Kruse) met 
<br>with Tobias, WHA PDAS Charles Shapiro, and Ambassador 
<br>Goldberg early March 2. Morales thanked Ambassador Tobias 
<br>for U.S. natural disaster assistance, saying that this year's 
<br>flooding is the worst Bolivia has seen in 60 years. Morales 
<br>said he is "very grateful" for the international cooperation 
<br>Bolivia has received. Ambassador Tobias conveyed the 
<br>sympathy of the American people for Bolivia's flooding 
<br>victims and informed Morales that two relief planes will 
<br>arrive March 5 to provide additional assistance. Tobias said 
<br>the USG is glad to have the opportunity to help Bolivia in 
<br>its time of need. Morales thanked Tobias for two additional 
<br>plane loads of assistance and said food rations and donations 
<br>will be needed for approximately six months in some areas, 
<br>until Bolivians can begin to recover from the disasters. 
<br>
<br>------------------------- 
<br>BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP 
<br>------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) On the bilateral relationship in general, Morales said 
<br>he wants an "excellent relationship" with the United States. 
<br>He explained that Bolivia has a culture of dialogue and that 
<br>debate is welcome. Morales said that while sometimes the 
<br>press wants to generate conflict between us, he wants the 
<br>"maximum level of cooperation with the USG." He acknowledged 
<br>that the United States is the most developed country in the 
<br>world, but noted that the United States faces environmental 
<br>challenges, implying that the United States could learn from 
<br>the Bolivians about how to live at peace with nature. 
<br>Ambassadors Tobias and Shapiro offered support for Bolivia's 
<br>goal of a more inclusive society, but Tobias noted that the 
<br>goal should be placed in the context of a democracy that 
<br>includes all Bolivians. Ambassador Tobias emphasized the 
<br>long relationship between Bolivia and the United States, 
<br>which he said the United States values and wants to continue. 
<br>Tobias told Morales that the United States and Bolivia have 
<br>many things in common, and that they should continue to work 
<br>to find common interests. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Morales asked for aid in creating jobs and improving 
<br>infrastructure and said he has "great interest" in the 
<br>Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) (particularly for a 
<br>highway from La Paz to Pando via Beni) and in an additional 
<br>ATPDEA extension. Morales thanked Tobias for Congress' 
<br>extension of ATPDEA benefits and said Bolivia wants commerce 
<br>with the United States so it can export goods to the U.S. 
<br>market. He noted that as developed and developing countries, 
<br>the United States and Bolivia complement each other well. 
<br>Morales also acknowledged the United States' prominent role 
<br>in international institutions including the World Bank and 
<br>the IDB, and said he was grateful for that assistance. 
<br>Morales said Bolivia's macroeconomic stability has improved 
<br>overall, largely due to increased hydrocarbons revenues, but 
<br>not enough to create sufficient jobs. He also pointed out 
<br>that his government's hydrocarbons' nationalization did not 
<br>include expropriation of property or assets. Ambassador 
<br>Tobias responded by saying that the USG is working hard to 
<br>improve lives, create jobs and increase investment in 
<br>Bolivia. We recognize that a stable economy is key to those 
<br>goals, he said. Tobias also encouraged Morales to 
<br>aggressively pursue a MCC proprosal. He emphasized that his 
<br>visit should be read as a strong signal that the United 
<br>States wants to work with Bolivia toward these goals. 
<br>
<br>------------- 
<br>SOCIAL UNREST 
<br>------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Morales described Bolivia's many marches and blockades 
<br>as largely local problems and accused opposition party 
<br>Podemos of organizing them and plotting against his 
<br>government. He said that in contrast to protests over the 
<br>past year, the marches he led prior to becoming president 
<br>were "apolitical"-- in support of human rights, coca, and 
<br>other causes. He said the Bolivian people received his 
<br>marches warmly by supporting the marchers and providing them 
<br>with food. Morales lamented the most violent conflict in his 
<br>administration to date-- the October 2006 conflict between 
<br>miners in Huanuni. Before the conflict, Morales said he 
<br>personally met with miners more than 15 times. He said he 
<br>told both sides that he would work to help them but that they 
<br>would have to work together. Morales regretted that they 
<br>couldn't, calling the violence the "worst moment" in his 
<br>administration. 
<br>
<br>-------------- 
<br>USAID SUPPORT 
<br>-------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Morales thanked Ambassador Tobias for USAID 
<br>assistance, highlighting alternative development programs in 
<br>particular. He noted the current high prices for 
<br>Chapare-produced palm hearts, as well as the GOB's desire to 
<br>export more bananas. Morales said Bolivia wants to export 
<br>alternative development products, as successes in alternative 
<br>development reduce coca cultivation. He mentioned the 
<br>importance of a good infrastructure for alternative 
<br>development projects, and thanked Tobias for USAID assistance 
<br>in constructing a road in the Chapare. While stating that 
<br>the GOB "wants to maximize U.S. cooperation," Morales 
<br>suggested that USAID assistance could be more efficient. He 
<br>said that for the cost of one USAID-constructed soccer field, 
<br>the GOB could have built three. (NOTE: Morales made this 
<br>argument previously and Ambassador Goldberg responded via 
<br>letter to explain that our numbers indicated otherwise). 
<br>Morales also mentioned health and education as critical areas 
<br>for international cooperation in Bolivia. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) After expressing gratitude for USAID assistance, 
<br>Morales indicated that he would prefer that international 
<br>assistance be donated to the central government, not 
<br>Bolivia's prefects or mayors. He said he would like to 
<br>establish a type of open registry to monitor aid, not for 
<br>purposes of controlling it but for the benefit of Bolivia's 
<br>development process. He said it would be useful to know the 
<br>amount of USAID assistance in Bolivia and what the money is 
<br>spent on. 
<br>
<br>-------------------- 
<br>COCA: MORE IS LESS? 
<br>-------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Ambassador Tobias highlighted both countries' interest 
<br>in close counternarcotics cooperation and acknowledged the 
<br>GOB's interdiction efforts. He said that while the United 
<br>States remains concerned that any increase in coca 
<br>cultivation will go to the illegal drug trade, he looked 
<br>forward to continuing to work through those issues with the 
<br>GOB. Morales responded by saying his government is serious 
<br>about fighting narcotics trafficking. He said that although 
<br>he has been accused of being a narcotrafficker, the GOB 
<br>policy is "zero cocaine, zero drugs." He said in Bolivia, 
<br>"one can't talk about zero coca." At the same time, he said, 
<br>his government's respect for the traditional use of coca does 
<br>not imply unrestricted growth. Morales also explained that 
<br>cocaine is not part of Bolivia's indigenous culture. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) In giving Ambassador Tobias some of his personal 
<br>history, Morales said he was not born a cocalero but moved to 
<br>Chapare in 1979-80 after completing his mandatory military 
<br>service. His family, he said, focused on rice production but 
<br>also grew a few catos of coca on the side. Because of 
<br>globalization and increased international trade in the 
<br>1980's, Brazilian rice became cheaper than Bolivian rice, 
<br>thus damaging his family's business. He recounted that in 
<br>those years of hyperinflation, people had to sell large 
<br>bundles of bananas to buy a coke or a beer. Morales said 
<br>eradication with government compensation failed because 
<br>people became accustomed to being paid large sums of money, 
<br>"like by a bank." In Morales' opinion, militarization also 
<br>failed, as it led to permanent confrontation without results. 
<br>These failures, Morales said, led him to suggest one cato of 
<br>coca per affiliate to limit production of coca and to prevent 
<br>conflict. He said that when he speaks to the Six Federations 
<br>(the main coca labor organization in the Chapare), he tells 
<br>them if they fail to respect the cato of coca, the GOB will 
<br>have to return to militarization. He said this serves as a 
<br>strong deterrent. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Regarding the GOB's future plans, Morales spoke in 
<br>terms of a net reduction of coca and said his government 
<br>plans to work harder in the Yungas (particularly in La Asunta 
<br>and in Caranavi). He also stressed the GOB's desire for 
<br>closer counternarcotics cooperation with the United States. 
<br>Morales lamented a lack of progress in the Yungas but said he 
<br>hoped the situation would improve. He thanked the USG for 
<br>its help eradicating in Bolivia's national parks, calling 
<br>counternarcotics a "shared responsibility." Morales, 
<br>however, also defended the GOB's proposal to raise the legal 
<br>limits of coca production to 20,000 hectares, saying it is 
<br>"impossible to guarantee 10,000- 12,000 hectares of coca" but 
<br>that 20,000 hectares is a more realistic goal. Likewise, he 
<br>defended the GOB's human rights-conscious policy of 
<br>"rationalization," or voluntary eradication, stating that 
<br>statistics show that the process is more effective if it is 
<br>voluntary. While Morales admitted increased coca cultivation 
<br>in some areas, he maintained those cases are the exception 
<br>and not the rule. Morales said he knows if he fails, the 
<br>United Nations and United States will be watching. In 
<br>response to Ambassador Tobias' inquiry about how much coca 
<br>should be approved for traditional uses under ideal 
<br>circumstances, Morales replied "less than 20,000 hectares." 
<br>He admitted, however, that the European Union's legal demand 
<br>study was "stuck." Overall, Morales said, he is optimistic 
<br>about the GOB's ability to fight narcotics trafficking, 
<br>having met its obligations in 2006. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br>A FIRST JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE WITH MORALES 
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶10. (SBU) In an unprecedented move, Morales joined Tobias for 
<br>a joint press conference following the meeting. Morales 
<br>stated publicly that he was "very happy" with the meeting, 
<br>and publicly thanked the USG for disaster assistance (noting 
<br>that more would arrive next week) and general cooperation. 
<br>Morales said the GOB's dialogue with the United States was 
<br>important to Bolivia and that it would continue. Morales 
<br>emphasized the GOB's "culture of dialogue" and its respect 
<br>for differences with other countries. Additionally, in 
<br>response to questions about the release of the INCSR report 
<br>March 1, Morales said that he respected the report as an 
<br>internal evaluation of our government, but that GOB 
<br>statistics on counternarcotics progress were very different. 
<br>
<br>--------- 
<br>COMMENT 
<br>--------- 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) In perhaps the Embassy's most positive meeting with 
<br>Morales to date, the president repeatedly thanked Tobias 
<br>privately and publicly for U.S. assistance. Morales seemed 
<br>to appreciate the finer points of USAID operations in Bolivia 
<br>and to have a superficial understanding of U.S. concerns on 
<br>counternarcotics (as reflected by his discussion of a net 
<br>reduction of coca). On trade, Morales clearly wants an 
<br>ATPDEA extension, as further evidenced by Foreign Minister 
<br>Choquehuanca's late February trip to Washington, but again 
<br>made no mention of a concrete free trade proposal. While it 
<br>seems that Morales may be warming to the benefits of a good 
<br>bilateral relationship, his willingness to cooperate on the 
<br>more difficult issues and to deliver solid political, 
<br>economic, and counternarcotics policies may still be another 
<br>matter. End comment. 
<br>
<br>This cable has been cleared by Ambassadors Tobias and Shapiro.
