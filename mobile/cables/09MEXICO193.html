<br>------- 
<br>Summary 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) 2008 set a new record for organized crime-related 
<br>homicides with more than 6000 killings. Violence in Mexico 
<br>suddenly provided fodder for U.S. and international media 
<br>with commentators suggesting worse to come. While the death 
<br>toll is already at disturbing levels, and there are no signs 
<br>violence will taper off anytime soon, we will continue to 
<br>evaluate information or evidence that would suggest the 
<br>cartels have decided to up the ante significantly by 
<br>undertaking mass-casualty attacks on civilians, 
<br>systematically attacking GOM officials or institutions or 
<br>targeting USG personnel. Internecine struggles among the 
<br>cartels and GOM counter narcotic successes have increased the 
<br>costs of doing business and account for most of the up-tick 
<br>last year. Frustrated traffickers, seeking to diversify 
<br>profit-making activities through kidnappings and extortion, 
<br>account for more. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br>Drug-Related Homicides on the Rise 
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Few killings in Mexico are thoroughly investigated, 
<br>and determining which are truly related to organized crime 
<br>remains an inexact science, but Mexico's Attorney General's 
<br>office's year-end estimate stands at 6262. Other GOM 
<br>authorities put the toll from organized crime slightly 
<br>higher. SEDENA reports that drug-related killings 
<br>represented roughly 17% of all homicides last year, while the 
<br>National System of Public Security (SNSP -- part of the 
<br>Public Security Secretariat (SSP)) estimates a total of 
<br>approximately 10,700 intentional homicides.

<br>Spike in Violence Concentrated at the Border 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Violence continued to be concentrated in a few key 
<br>states, and in 2008 there was a spike in drug-related 
<br>killings in the northern border territories. An estimated 41 
<br>percent of these homicides took place in Chihuahua and Baja 
<br>California states and largely in two urban areas, Ciudad 
<br>Juarez and Tijuana. (see MEXICO 3586). Sinaloa continued to 
<br>rank among the most violent states with approximately 1048 
<br>(or 18%) of these killings. The surge in violence along the 
<br>border stems largely from the intensified struggle among 
<br>cartels over a few lucrative land crossings to the U.S. In 
<br>particular, the January 2008 arrest of cartel leader Alfredo 
<br>Beltran Leyva sparked a serious rift among the Gulf, Juarez 
<br>and Sinaloa (Pacific) cartels, which is being played out 
<br>viciously in Ciudad Juarez. (See MEXICO 1766) In Tijuana, 
<br>rival factions of the weakened Arellano Felix Organization, 
<br>one of which is backed by the Sinaloa cartel, are battling 
<br>for control. 
<br>
<br>-------------------------- 
<br>Changes In Cartel Behavior 
<br>-------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) Beyond its broadened scope, the nature of cartel 
<br>violence changed in 2008: organized violence was 
<br>characterized by significantly increased brutality, a callous 
<br>disregard for the potential for collateral damage and more 
<br>frequent targeting of soldiers and police. Mexico's drug 
<br>trafficking organizations (DTOs) have also more frequently 
<br>orchestrated violence to send intimidating messages to 
<br>security forces, the Mexican public and the body politic. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) Incidents, such as the August beheadings of 12 in 
<br>Yucatan, the execution style killing of 24 on the outskirts 
<br>of Mexico City in September, late fall killings of soldiers 
<br>in Monterrey and Guerrero in late December contributed to 
<br>growing public unease here and garnered media attention 
<br>abroad. Several first-time-ever incidents involving grenades 
<br>and improvised explosive devices (such as the notorious 
<br>Independence Day grenade attack in Morelia, the shooting and 
<br>undetonated grenade attack on the US Consulate in Monterrey, 
<br>the use of improvised explosive devices in downtown Mexico 
<br>City and Sinaloa, and a grenade attack on police cadets in 
<br>Jalisco) demonstrate that not only have the cartels 
<br>successfully expanded their arsenals, but at least some 
<br>elements have developed a tolerance for inflicting civilian 
<br>casualties. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) Cartels have also expanded their use of violence to 
<br>intimidate. Beheadings and the prominent placement of 
<br>dismembered bodies in public places, relatively rare two 
<br>years ago are now common throughout the country. The late 
<br>night grenade/shooting attack on our consulate in Monterrey 
<br>was obviously designed to send a message, although no 
<br>individual or group has ever claimed responsibility. More 
<br>explicit was the January assault on the Monterrey offices of 
<br>Televisa, accompanied by a message telling the broadcaster to 
<br>do a better job reporting on corrupt public officials. 
<br>Attacks such as these remain sporadic so far, and we have 
<br>insufficient indications whether they mark a new trend or 
<br>not. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) Despite these sporadic attacks, Mexico's drug war 
<br>continues to primarily impact security forces and those 
<br>linked directly or indirectly to the drug trade. The 
<br>civilian population in some urban areas along the border 
<br>remains bunkered down with some of those who have the money 
<br>either sending their children to school in the U.S. or 
<br>relocating entirely to minimize risk. In much of the rest of 
<br>the country, though, the civilian population not involved in 
<br>the drug trade remains essentially insulated from the 
<br>violence, though not from its effects. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------- 
<br>Police Killings Increase Along With Overall Death Toll 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------- 
<br>¶8. (SBU) SEDENA estimates that at least 522 civilian law 
<br>enforcement and military personnel were murdered last year, 
<br>compared to 315 in 2007.

<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Increased confrontations between security forces and 
<br>criminals is one explanation for the increasing killing of 
<br>security forces personnel. GOM authorities argue that 
<br>killings are no longer just score-settling among bad cops, 
<br>but increasingly the consequence of the government's 
<br>aggressive fight against the cartels. Some analysts we have 
<br>spoken to agree. However, they also note that with few 
<br>exceptions the majority of deaths are not the result of 
<br>direct confrontations. They argue that the crackdown on 
<br>police corruption has put compromised police officials in the 
<br>position of either being prosecuted or breaking their 
<br>established agreements/arrangements with the cartels. Hence, 
<br>some of those who presumably choose the latter course are 
<br>being punished brutally. (See MEXICO 2371, 3498) 
<br>
<br>¶10. (SBU) It is worth noting that police victims (at all 
<br>levels of government) represented eight percent of all 2008 
<br>killings believed to be drug-related, a figure slightly lower 
<br>than the percentage in 2007. The vast majority of victims 
<br>continue to be state and municipal law enforcement officers. 
<br>Senior level, federal police killings were still rare 
<br>occurrences in 2008. The most high-profile death remains the 
<br>May killing of Edgar Millan Gomez, the country's 
<br>highest-ranking federal police officer. 
<br>
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br>Targeting of Soldiers An Ominous Sign 
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br>¶11. (S/NF) There have been notable incidents of horrific 
<br>violence against soldiers, including a string of slayings of 
<br>enlisted men in Monterrey in October and the systematic 
<br>decapitation of seven troops in Guerrero (see MEXICO 3779). 
<br>The theory that those killed in Guerrero were rogue soldiers 
<br>involved in drug trafficking has been discounted, suggesting 
<br>the cartels have begun to target soldiers to exact revenge 
<br>for successes registered by the military and attempt to 
<br>undermine the institution's resolve. The Monterrey and 
<br>Guerrero killings immediately followed successful military 
<br>operations in the respective regions resulting in seizures 
<br>and arrests. Whether such tactics will have a chilling 
<br>effect remains to be seen. Sources tell us that while some 
<br>soldiers are more fearful, many others are keen to strike 
<br>back at the cartels with greater resolve. SEDENA and SEMAR 
<br>have instructed regional commanders to implement force 
<br>protection counter-measures to reduce the risk of future 
<br>incidents. 
<br>
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br>U.S. Personnel and Institutions Targets? 
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) We have observed a significant up-tick in threats, 
<br>as well as incidents of surveillance, against USG personnel 
<br>and properties over the last three months. All threats are 
<br>treated seriously and precautions taken; fortunately, none 
<br>has come to fruition. 
<br>
<br>¶13. (S/NF) On October 12, unknown persons fired gunshots and 
<br>tossed an un-detonated grenade at the U.S. Consulate in 
<br>Monterrey. The attack occurred after hours, no one was 
<br>injured, and little damage occurred. No message was left and 
<br>we have uncovered no useful intelligence regarding the 
<br>authors or their motives. One unsubstantiated report cited a 
<br>source claiming a senior Gulf cartel leader ordered the 
<br>attack. However, with little hard evidence, no attempt to 
<br>claim credit and no follow on incident to date, the 
<br>possibility remains that this was an isolated, possibly even 
<br>impulsive, attack not likely undertaken at the behest of 
<br>senior cartel leaders. 
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) While the cartels have not yet directly targeted USG 
<br>law enforcement or other personnel, they have shown little 
<br>reticence about going after some of our most reliable 
<br>partners in Mexican law enforcement agencies. Ten close DEA 
<br>law enforcement liaison officers have been killed since 2007, 
<br>seven of whom were members of Special Vetted Units. 
<br>Similarly, within the past two years 51 close FBI contacts 
<br>have been murdered. More than sixty of Mexico's best law 
<br>enforcement officers in whom we have placed our trust and 
<br>with whom we have collaborated on sensitive investigations, 
<br>shared intelligence and in many cases trained and vetted have 
<br>been murdered by the cartels. We do know from sources that 
<br>cartel members have at least contemplated the possibility of 
<br>doing harm to both our personnel and institutions, but we 
<br>frankly don't know enough about how DTO members think and 
<br>operate to know what factors might trigger a decision to 
<br>mount such an attack, but the potential threat is very real. 
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) We assess that the threat to U.S. personnel could 
<br>increase if the violence continues to escalate and more 
<br>high-level government officials and political leaders are 
<br>targeted. Also, a reaction may be triggered if traffickers 
<br>perceive their losses are due to U.S. support to the GOM's 
<br>counter-narcotics efforts. We will continue to monitor 
<br>potential threats to U.S. personnel from organized criminal 
<br>gangs and be alert to information that suggests drug 
<br>traffickers increasingly see the U.S. hand as responsible for 
<br>their losses. 
<br>
<br>--------------------- 
<br>A Measure of Success? 
<br>--------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) While attributing last year's significant spike in 
<br>violence to its own successes marks an effort by the Calderon 
<br>administration to put the best face possible on a grim 
<br>situation, there is also considerable truth to the assertion. 
<br>President Calderon's counter-narcotics team has scored 
<br>significant successes, particularly in the last 12 months. 
<br>Record numbers of weapons and drugs have been seized, key 
<br>members of drug cartels have been arrested and/or extradited, 
<br>cartel sources inside government institutions have been 
<br>arrested ) including a former Deputy Attorney General and 
<br>the head of Interpol in Mexico. The GOM has disrupted cartel 
<br>operations in meaningful ways; in year-end reports SEDENA and 
<br>SEMAR reported that together they have reduced the maritime 
<br>trafficking of illicit drugs by 65 percent and cut direct air 
<br>transit of illegal drugs from Colombia by 90 percent. 
<br>According to collaborative sensitive reporting, the January 
<br>2008 arrest of Alfredo Beltran Leyva split the Pacific 
<br>Cartel, and accentuated antagonism between that DTO and the 
<br>Gulf organization which caused the spike in violence in 
<br>Chihuahua, Sinaloa, and Baja California (see also MEXICO 
<br>1766). In addition to these rifts, frustrated traffickers 
<br>have turned to kidnappings and extortion to compensate for 
<br>the loss in drug-trafficking revenue, expanding their reach 
<br>and impacting a greater number of bystanders who have no 
<br>involvement in DTO activities. These kinds of impacts bring 
<br>home to ordinary Mexicans the nature of the struggle here. 
<br>
<br>------- 
<br>Outlook 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶17. (C) Mexican authorities and law enforcement analysts 
<br>predict that violence will likely get worse before it gets 
<br>better. Recent truce rumors notwithstanding, there is 
<br>currently no indication that the violence will soon abate; 
<br>CENAPI reports 280 killings for the first 20 days of January. 
<br>The cartels have shown themselves to be remarkably 
<br>innovative, vicious, and resilient when aggressively 
<br>confronted. Given their powerful weaponry and deep 
<br>penetration of the country's security institutions, further 
<br>attacks against security forces and government officials seem 
<br>all but inevitable. However, while violence remains at 
<br>unacceptably high levels here, we have no reason to believe 
<br>at this point that it will escalate either quantitatively or 
<br>qualitatively.
