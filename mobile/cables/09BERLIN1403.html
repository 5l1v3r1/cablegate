<br>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR SECRETARY CLINTON'S VISIT TO
<br>BERLIN, NOVEMBER 8-10 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Phillip Murphy for reasons 1.4 (b,d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Embassy Berlin warmly welcomes you to
<br>Germany for the historic 20th Anniversary of the Fall of the
<br>Berlin Wall. Berlin is hosting all four-powers and EU
<br>leaders at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate to mark this occasion.
<br>Your visit includes meetings with Chancellor Merkel and
<br>Foreign Minister Westerwelle. Chancellor Merkel will likely
<br>raise concern about General Motors' November 3 decision to
<br>keep its German subsidiary, Opel, and Westerwelle may likely
<br>raise his interest in removal of nuclear weapons from
<br>Germany. You may wish to encourage from them:
<br>
<br>-- Assurances that the proposed Afghanistan conference will
<br>not slip past January and that Germany will go immediately to
<br>the Bundestag if increases in contributions are warranted;
<br>-- Support for including banking and insurance relations with
<br>Iran in calculations for possible new sanctions, and no
<br>backsliding on export controls;
<br>-- Assurances that Germany and the EU will work with the U.S.
<br>at Copenhagen and not seek to isolate;
<br>-- Agreement to tone down the public rhetoric on Opel;
<br>-- German prodding of Russia to engage constructively on
<br>security issues and human rights.
<br>
<br>Recognizing Germany's prominent and international role on
<br>this occasion is important to Merkel. She is still trying to
<br>get a sense of working with the new Washington Administration
<br>and seems uncertain at times. Of course, Westerwelle is
<br>learning the ropes and being watched by Merkel to see if he
<br>can be an effective FM for her. Alternatively, Merkel may
<br>look to new Defense Minister zu Guttenberg (CSU) to play an
<br>alternative role on foreign policy. End summary.
<br>
<br>Political Climate
<br>-----------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) The political divisions that marked the recent
<br>election campaign, culminating in the October 28 swearing-in
<br>of a center-right coalition led by Chancellor Merkel, will be
<br>swept aside for your celebratory visit. Merkel just returned
<br>from what she considers an exceptional visit to Washington,
<br>which front-paged her address to Congress in every
<br>publication. Merkel will be focused on setting her
<br>priorities for the next legislative term -- she gives a major
<br>state of the union-like address on November 10 on all issues
<br>-- and will seek U.S. cooperation in promoting economic
<br>recovery and growth (Opel, regulation), progress in
<br>addressing climate change (Copenhagen), and strengthening
<br>Germany's international profile (Afghanistan). Westerwelle
<br>will have spent a total of some two days work in the foreign
<br>ministry by the time your arrive. His ministry is not sure
<br>what he wants yet.
<br>
<br>Economic Climate
<br>----------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Germany's export-driven economy is showing initial
<br>signs of recovery from its deepest recession since WW II.
<br>For the full year 2009, GDP will shrink around 5%, but should
<br>show modest growth of 1% next year. Unemployment has
<br>remained relatively low thanks to government-subsidized
<br>programs, but is expected to rise next year. Given the
<br>government's record budget deficit, there is heated debate
<br>over the wisdom of the new coalition's proposed tax cuts,
<br>intended to boost growth. Germany was pleased with the
<br>outcome of the G-20 Summit in Pittsburgh, but is keener on
<br>the G-20's regulatory agenda than addressing global
<br>imbalances.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) GM's sudden decision on November 3 to cancel the sale
<br>of its European subsidiary Opel in a deal underwritten by the
<br>German government shocked and angered Germans. Merkel's
<br>chief economic advisor told the Ambassador November 4 that
<br>Merkel was so furious at GM's about-face that she refused to
<br>take a call from GM CEO Fritz Henderson. Merkel subsequently
<br>called the President. Federal and state governments are
<br>demanding that GM immediately pay back 1.2 billion Euros in
<br>bridge loans they had extended to the car maker. What
<br>particularly irked the Germans was that GM had failed to
<br>forewarn them of their latest flip-flop after months of
<br>laborious negotiations and a total of 4.5 billion Euros in
<br>loans/guarantees in exchange for promises to retain most Opel
<br>jobs and plants in Germany. (Merkel found out about the GM
<br>decision just hours after delivering her address before
<br>Congress.) The Opel story has dominated the news November
<br>4-5. Opel workers are likely to strike in the next few days,
<br>and politicians and others are citing the GM action as
<br>another example of American "turbo-capitalism."

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Iran/Export Controls
<br>-----------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) You should express appreciation for Merkel's strong
<br>statement during her speech to Congress that there should be
<br>"zero tolerance" for Iranian acquisition of weapons of mass
<br>destruction. You should stress the importance of German
<br>support for EU measures or measures taken by "like-minded"
<br>countries should a UNSCR be unattainable due to a possible
<br>Iranian rejection of the engagement track. With Westerwelle,
<br>it remains imperative that you raise the importance of P5 1
<br>unity again. In addition, you should stress the particular
<br>importance of continued German leadership on export control,
<br>particularly in light of recent interdictions of Iranian arms
<br>shipments. The new German coalition seeks to expand exports
<br>by normalizing German export control policy (of arms and
<br>dual-use items) with the EU. Germany contends that its
<br>intention is to raise the EU to the German standard, but the
<br>danger is that German standards could be watered down to an
<br>EU lowest common denominator.
<br>
<br>Arms Control/Disarmament
<br>------------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Westerwelle is on a bit of a tangent by publicly
<br>calling for removal of nuclear weapons from Germany, although
<br>he insists that Berlin will not act unilaterally. This gets
<br>him attention and he then offers assurances that everything
<br>must be done in the NATO context, but it distracts from other
<br>issues. This is one of the few foreign policy positions that
<br>distinguishes his FDP from Chancellor Merkel's CDU, and
<br>Westerwelle may feel pressed to mention this. The MFA
<br>emphasizes that Westerwelle's position does not necessarily
<br>mean that Germany intends to cease participation in the NATO
<br>nuclear share. Germany may be willing to maintain its fleet
<br>of dual-capable aircraft, but have the applicable nuclear
<br>weapons stored in the U.S. or elsewhere. Westerwelle also
<br>understands that some Allies may want to maintain their
<br>current stock of NATO nuclear weapons. Your meeting with
<br>Westerwelle is a good opportunity to emphasize any red lines
<br>or concerns we have before this effort gets too far down the
<br>road. For its part, the Chancellery, MFA and MOD are
<br>uncomfortable with Westerwelle's push and sees no reason to
<br>tackle this issue right now.
<br>
<br>Afghanistan: Small Window for More Troops
<br>-----------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) FM Westerwelle has strongly defended German
<br>engagement in Afghanistan, both military and civilian, as
<br>vital to German national security interests. However, he
<br>supports the Chancellor's recent decision to put off any
<br>consideration of deploying additional German soldiers until
<br>after the proposed international conference on Afghanistan
<br>early next year, notwithstanding the significantly
<br>deteriorated security situation in the north. The new
<br>government sees the
<br>conference as critical for setting a new framework and
<br>benchmarks for the international engagement in Afghanistan,
<br>as well as for prescribing what is expected of the Afghan
<br>government in return. It is in our interest to capitalize on
<br>the Germans' sense of "ownership" of the north in getting a
<br>commitment from Westerwelle to seriously re-consider a troop
<br>increase after the Afghanistan conference early next year,
<br>if, in fact, he and Merkel rule out any increase before then.
<br>Within this context, it would be important to acknowledge
<br>that Germany is the fourth largest provider of civilian
<br>development assistance in Afghanistan and is an enthusiastic
<br>supporter of the U.S. Focused District Development (FDD)
<br>civilian police training program, which it joined in January
<br>of this year.
<br>
<br>Middle East
<br>-----------
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) You should thank Merkel for her strong statements
<br>before Congress where she stressed the overarching importance
<br>of Israel's security and a two-state solution. In general,
<br>Merkel has been very supportive of U.S. efforts in the Middle
<br>East. She is now planning the second round of German-Israeli
<br>government consultations, likely before the end of the year.
<br>She may raise this with you and seek your advice on messages
<br>to Netanyahu. We understand that Westerwelle may also be
<br>planning to visit Israel. The MFA said that Westerwelle may
<br>seek a greater German role to promote peace, for example to
<br>offer German support in coordinating Middle East policy with
<br>the EU. According to the MFA, Westerwelle may also raise the
<br>concept of creating some type of OSCE-like security structure
<br>
<br>BERLIN 00001403 003 of 003
<br>
<br>
<br>for the Middle East.
<br>
<br>Reluctance with Overseas Deployments
<br>------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Germany continues to wrestle with the issue of
<br>overseas deployments. Westerwelle, and the FDP in general,
<br>tend to be more skeptical than Merkel's CDU on this topic and
<br>this is reflected in the government coalition agreement. The
<br>coalition agreement calls for a "gradual reduction" of German
<br>participation in UNIFIL "with the perspective of bringing it
<br>to an end." Similarly, the agreement calls for a "critical
<br>review" of the "multitude" of parliamentary mandates for the
<br>Bundeswehr to participate in counterterrorism and piracy
<br>operations off the Horn of Africa, again with a view toward
<br>reducing them. It would be helpful for you to emphasize how
<br>important we view Germany's contributions to these
<br>international operations.
<br>
<br>Russia/Energy Security
<br>----------------------
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) We expect Germany to be less forgiving of Russian
<br>bullying of its eastern European neighbors through cut-offs
<br>of natural gas supplies, especially given the departure of
<br>former Foreign Minister Steinmeier -- known for his
<br>relatively pro-Russian views. Still, we expect Germany to
<br>continue to place a heavy emphasis on maintaining good
<br>relations with Russia, believing that constructive engagement
<br>and assistance with modernization are the best way to deal
<br>with this difficult "strategic partner." Germany is Europe's
<br>largest energy user and is highly dependent on Russia for
<br>energy supplies, but Berlin does not view this as a
<br>vulnerability, believing that Moscow is equally dependent on
<br>Germany as a consumer. Germany nevertheless recognizes that
<br>it must diversify its sources of supply, routes, and means of
<br>energy generation to gain greater energy security.
<br>
<br>Climate Change
<br>--------------
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) As the Chancellor's remarks underline, German
<br>officials want strong U.S. leadership going into the
<br>Copenhagen Summit. They are advocating for a unified US/EU
<br>position towards the major emerging economies, particularly
<br>China and India, to urge them to commit to ambitious national
<br>actions at Copenhagen. They are looking for signals of our
<br>commitment to domestic and international actions that will
<br>allow us to collectively meet science-based targets. German
<br>leaders recognize the challenge of passing climate change
<br>legislation in the U.S. and have lowered their expectations
<br>for the possibility of reaching a legally binding agreement
<br>next month at Copenhagen. They have begun to describe the
<br>Summit as one step in a larger process -- a politically
<br>binding framework -- and may be preparing the German public
<br>for a less ambitious outcome.
<br>
<br>Mission Germany
<br>---------------
<br>
<br>¶12. (SBU) Madam Secretary, the U.S. government presence in
<br>Germany currently numbers 744 US direct-hire (USDH)
<br>employees, 683 locally engaged (LE) staff, and 951 USG EFMs
<br>and a State operating budget of $153 million annually. This
<br>includes a Frankfurt cohort of over 500 USDH employees whose
<br>responsibilities support USG operations globally. Berlin's
<br>USG presence -- over 500 USDHs and LE staff -- is centered in
<br>the new Chancery next to the Brandenburg Gate. The LE staff
<br>includes many employees who have worked for the USG for over
<br>30 years. Mission Germany is on the cutting edge of using IT
<br>solutions xxxxx.
