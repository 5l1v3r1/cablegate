<br>E.O. 12958: DECLl: 10/29/2018
<br>TAGS: PGOV PK PTER PREL TFIN ETRD
<br>Subject: ambassador convoked over u.s. Attacks
<br>
<br>Classified By: Anne W. Patterson for reasons 1.4 (b), (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: On October 29, Pakistani xxxxxxxxxxxx 
<br>convoked Ambassador to raise several
<br>recent hot-button issues. In response to a Pakistani Senate
<br>resolution, xxxxxxxxxxxx raised protests against alleged
<br>U.S. attacks inside Pakistani territory. He reiterated MFA
<br>requests to repatriate Aafia Siddiqi and pushed back on
<br>pending 1267 cases. The protests were largely pro forma but
<br>the meeting is already being reported in Pakistani press as
<br>MFA's "strong protest" against U.S. violations of
<br>sovereignty. End Summary.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) On October 27, the Pakistani Senate passed a
<br>resolution strongly condemning alleged attacks by U.S. drones
<br>in Pakistani territory. The Senators called upon the GOP to
<br>convey this protest to U.S. and NATO/ISAF authorities. In
<br>response, Acting xxxxxxxxxxxx convoked
<br>Ambassador to register their ongoing complaints. xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>repeated previous GOP statements condemning the violation of
<br>territorial integrity and also reiterated that such attacks
<br>undermine political solutions in the tribal areas of
<br>Pakistan. Ambassador noted the ongoing and successful
<br>military cooperation between the U.S. and Pakistan.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx also raised concern about Dr. Aafia Siddiqi's
<br>repatriation and the whereabouts of her two young children.
<br>Ambassador made it clear that U.S. authorities do not know
<br>the whereabouts of the children, who have never been in U.S.
<br>custody, and noted that the Pakistani Embassy has been given
<br>full consular access to Siddiqi. xxxxxxxxxxxx was aware that
<br>Siddiqi is currently being assessed for mental fitness to
<br>stand trial in the U.S., but noted that the MFA had been
<br>required to report to the Islamabad High Court on a case
<br>demanding that the GOP repatriate Siddiqi.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx lastly raised the issue of 1267 case statements,
<br>particularly four new cases including that of former Director
<br>General of ISI Hamid Gul. xxxxxxxxxxxx requested that the case
<br>statements include more verifiable evidence so that the GOP
<br>would not block them. He suggested that more intelligence
<br>sharing early in the process would expedite these cases and
<br>highlighted cases regarding terrorism financing where
<br>technical evidence might be shared. Additionally, he
<br>suggested that the cases be disaggregated to allow the easy
<br>one to go forward faster. By submitting the 1267 cases in a
<br>block, the GOP refuses them in a block as well even if some
<br>would pass independently.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Comment: Despite the MFA's media statement, xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>delivered his concerns in a pro forma manner. We have told
<br>the MFA repeatedly that there currently is no legal basis to
<br>repatriate Siddiqi, and we have no idea on the location of
<br>her other two children.
