<br>SUBJECT: 40TH JOINT POLITICAL-MILITARY GROUP: EXECUTIVE 
<br>SESSION (PART 1 OF 4) 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: A/DCM Marc Sievers, reasons 1.4 (b,d) 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (S) Summary:  During the Executive Session of the 40th 
<br>Joint Political Military Group (JPMG), U.S. and Israeli 
<br>counterparts continued discussion on the creation of four new 
<br>Qualitative Military Edge (QME) working groups.  GOI 
<br>interlocutors continued to raise concerns regarding the F-15 
<br>sale to Saudi Arabia.  Both sides agreed that continued 
<br>pressure be applied to Iran, especially following the 
<br>disclosure of the nuclear facility in Qom.  GOI participants 
<br>expressed concern regarding Chinese and Russian cooperation 
<br>with respect to enhanced Iranian sanctions.  The GOI also 
<br>raised dual citizenship concerns with respect to access to 
<br>sensitive technology, and noted from its perspective Turkey's 
<br>disturbing change of course toward Syria and Iran -- and away 
<br>from Israel.  This is the first in four cables (septels) 
<br>reporting on the JPMG.  End summary.

<br> 
<br>Qualitative Military Edge 
<br>------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S) The Executive Session continued discussion from the 
<br>September 30 Qualitative Military Edge (QME) meeting in 
<br>Washington.  Both sides presented their primary points of 
<br>contact for the four newly proposed working groups focusing 
<br>on previous agreements, mitigation measures for the F-15 sale 
<br>to Saudi Arabia, technical mitigation issues, and 
<br>intelligence/policy.  Agreement was reached to begin working 
<br>on the details of each working group's meeting schedule and 
<br>timeline. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (S) The GOI continued to express concern over the F-15 
<br>sale to Saudi Arabia.  U.S. participants noted that the USG 
<br>is unable to provide more detailed information about the sale 
<br>until Saudi Arabia officially sends a Letter of Request 
<br>(LOR).  The GOI expressed additional concerns about 
<br>stationing these new aircraft at Tabuk airfield in the 
<br>northwest corner of Saudi Arabia -- close to the Israeli 
<br>border.  U.S. participants stated the USG understanding that 
<br>this should not be an issue, as the Saudis are considering 
<br>stationing new Typhoon aircraft at Tabuk.  The GOI also 
<br>raised AMRAAM sales to Jordan; U.S. participants explained 
<br>that the new C-7 AMRAAM is an export version with 
<br>capabilities similar to the C-5 version -- and therefore 
<br>provides little to no increase in capabilities. 
<br> 
<br>Iran, China and Russia 
<br>---------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (S) Both sides expressed concern over the recent 
<br>revelation regarding Iran's nuclear facility at Qom, and 
<br>agreed that increased pressure should be applied directly and 
<br>internationally against Iran in order to better determine 
<br>Tehran's motives and next steps.  Both sides agreed that the 
<br>facility at Qom should be inspected immediately.  One member 
<br>of the Israeli delegation expressed the opinion that some 
<br>consideration be given to "shutting Qom operations down 
<br>completely" to prevent further progress on obtaining a 
<br>nuclear weapon.  That said, the GOI argued that the 
<br>international community not become bogged down on the Tehran 
<br>Research Reactor (TRR) and Qom, thereby diverting focus from 
<br> 
<br>TEL AVIV 00002500  002 OF 002 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>the bigger issue of Iran's nuclear program. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (S) Several questions were raised about China's position 
<br>on Iran's efforts to acquire a nuclear weapon.  Both sides 
<br>agreed that continued engagement with China and Russia is 
<br>needed -- as well as building a consensus in Europe.  The USG 
<br>speculated, and the GOI concurred, that China will follow 
<br>Moscow's lead.  USG participants argued that China would seek 
<br>to avoid an international confrontation over Iran. The GOI 
<br>described 2010 as a critical year -- if the Iranians continue 
<br>to protect and harden their nuclear sites, it will be more 
<br>difficult to target and damage them.  Both sides then 
<br>discussed the upcoming delivery of GBU-28 bunker busting 
<br>bombs to Israel, noting that the transfer should be handled 
<br>quietly to avoid any allegations that the USG is helping 
<br>Israel prepare for a strike against Iran. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (S) The GOI made the case for "crippling sanctions"; 
<br>cooperation between the United States, Europe, Russia and 
<br>China will be necessary in order for these sanctions to be 
<br>effective.  U.S. participants stressed the USG position that 
<br>any discussions with Iran on this subject be finite; the USG 
<br>will continue to monitor whether negotiations are making 
<br>progress.  The GOI stated that it is not convinced the 
<br>Iranians will negotiate in good faith unless there are 
<br>visible and clear threats.  U.S. delegation members described 
<br>eight lanes of sanctions, and outlined a plan to "pivot to 
<br>apply appropriate pressure" on those points and tracks that 
<br>have the most impact.  U.S. participants concurred that 2010 
<br>is a critical year -- but the continued application of 
<br>pressure is vital. 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (S) Regarding Russia, the GOI was not confident that 
<br>Moscow will be helpful in any Iranian sanctions effort -- GOI 
<br>participants opined that Russia is considered a "mystery" 
<br>with respect to their views on Iran.  The GOI raised the 
<br>Russian S-300 sale to Iran, noting that the transfer is still 
<br>pending.  GOI participants argued that Moscow seeks a return 
<br>to superpower status, but there are contradictory trends 
<br>regarding Russia's internal condition. 
<br> 
<br>Dual Citizenship Issues 
<br>----------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (S) The GOI raised the issue of dual citizenship within 
<br>the context of access to sensitive technology.  U.S. 
<br>participants acknowledged Israeli concerns, noting that the 
<br>issue is being worked at the highest levels of the USG to 
<br>reach consensus on how to proceed.  The GOI recommended 
<br>obtaining a waiver similar to the relationship from which 
<br>Canada or Australia benefit. 
<br> 
<br>Turkey 
<br>------ 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (S) The GOI raised the current direction the Government 
<br>of Turkey has taken toward Syria and Iran -- and away from 
<br>Israel.  Israeli participants argued that Turkey has been 
<br>supportive of Hamas in Gaza while pursuing a more "Islamic" 
<br>direction with the goal of becoming a regional superpower. 
<br>The GOI argued that the Turkish military is losing its 
<br>ability to influence government decisions and strategic 
<br>direction.  After this past year, GOI participants said they 
<br>have a "bad feeling" about Turkey.  The GOI noted that the 
<br>Israel Air Force (IAF) Commander in the past wanted to speak 
<br>to the Turkish Air Force Commander, but his Turkish 
<br>counterpart declined. 
<br> 
<br>¶11.  (U) A/S Shapiro has cleared on this cable.
