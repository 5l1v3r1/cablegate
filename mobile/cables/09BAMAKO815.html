<br>SUBJECT: CLOSING CEREMONY OF JCET TRAINING OF MALIAN ARMY 
<br>ETIA 4 IN GAO 
<br>
<br>REF: BAMAKO 813 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Gillian A. Milovanovic, for reasons 1.4 (b) ( 
<br>d). 
<br>
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) On December 11 the DCM and DATT participated in the 
<br>graduation ceremony of a Joint Combined Exchange Training 
<br>(JCET) exercise of the Malian Army Echelon Tactique Interarme 
<br>(ETIA) 4, in Gao. ETIA 4 is based in Timbuktu. The 10th 
<br>Army Special Forces Group out of Fort Carson, Colorado, and 
<br>led by Captain XXXXXXXXXXXX and Master Sergeant 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX, conducted the JCET. Overall,
<br> XXXXXXXXXXXX said the  approximately 160 
<br>men learned a lot over the five week 
<br>training exercise. The exercise was shorter than planned in 
<br>the wake of a hostage taking incident in Mali which led to a 
<br>change in THREATCON and the US military-ordered temporary 
<br>suspension of training while the JCET team was temporarily 
<br>restricted to its quarters. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) The Governor of Gao region, Colonel XXXXXXXXXXXX, 
<br>presided over the JCET graduation and thanked the U.S. 
<br>Government for its commitment to helping Mali defend itself. 
<br>Noting that he had served as military commander of the 
<br>Timbuktu region during the time of the Tuareg rebellion, he 
<br>exhorted ETIA 4 to apply what it had learned in the course of 
<br>the training. A product of numerous IMET training 
<br>opportunities in the United States and recently returned from 
<br>a five year tour in Addis Ababa as Mali,s military attach, 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX displayed an unfortunate lack of respect for the 
<br>common soldiers who are being asked to lead the fight against 
<br>AQIM. He distractedly waved on the many troops who stood at 
<br>attention before him after receiving their graduation 
<br>certificates, leaving the DATT to return their salutes. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) When the DCM asked him about the security 
<br>situation in Gao, XXXXXXXXXXXX said
<br> he viewed the kidnapping of  French citizen
<br> Pierre Cammatte as a worrisome escalation, as 
<br>AQIM had until now refrained from taking hostages on Malian 
<br>soil. Nevertheless, he minimized the risk, saying that 
<br>although many had left, there were still quite a few French 
<br>and other European nationals working in Gao Region. He did 
<br>not reiterate his September 23 request to the Ambassador for 
<br>more development assistance. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) After the ceremony XXXXXXXXXXXX called over one, 
<br>rather unimpressive soldier, an older, rail thin man with a 
<br>scraggly beard and bloodshot eyes who had been lounging 
<br>against a motorbike in a dirty T-shirt inside of a warehouse. 
<br>He explained that in spite of appearances, this was one of 
<br>the ETIA's best men, noting that he had been one of the few 
<br>survivors of a July 4 ambush of a Malian Army patrol by Al 
<br>Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (see IIR 6 958 0087 09). When 
<br>asked how the training had gone, the soldier said if he had 
<br>known at the time of the ambush what he had learned over the 
<br>course of the JCET, it never would have happened. He cited 
<br>in particular learning why and how to establish a mobile 
<br>patrol post, digging and manning foxholes which afford 360 
<br>degree, round-the-clock protection from potential assailants. 
<br>The soldier said the Salafists would never confront the Army 
<br>head-on, and if the Army engaged, they would flee, but if 
<br>there is not proper security, they will creep back and murder 
<br>you in the most cruel, unimaginable ways. 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX noted that the ETIA had done 
<br>simulation exercises to defend, for 
<br>example, the recovery of a broken down vehicle. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) The commander of ETIA 4, a major, also spoke 
<br>highly of the training. He noted that he had already reached 
<br>the end of his six month rotation, but had been extended so 
<br>as to be able to lead participation in the JCET. He said he 
<br>does not want to leave his men, and spoke about the logic of 
<br>having a longer tour so as to develop skills over time and to 
<br>build on training rather than starting from the beginning 
<br>each time there is an opportunity for a JCET or other 
<br>training. Nevertheless, it was evident from the preponderant 
<br>number of black African faces in the ranks that most of ETIA 
<br>4 was not from the North, and service in the North will 
<br>clearly be a significant hardship on them and their families, 
<br>most of whom live in the South. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S) XXXXXXXXXXXX said that each soldier had expended some 
<br>1,000 rounds of ammunition during the course of the training. 
<br>Although a U.S. Special Forces soldier might expend that 
<br>
<br>much in a day of training, he noted that a number of the 
<br>Malian soldiers said it was probably more than they had used 
<br>in their entire careers. He said the JCET had revealed, and 
<br>made an effort to correct, some simple lacunae. For example, 
<br>when the survivors of the July 4 ambush were asked why they 
<br>had left behind so many vehicles to be captured by AQIM, they 
<br>said the drivers had been killed and no one else in the unit 
<br>knew how to drive. When asked why they had not used a heavy 
<br>machine gun, they answered that the gunner who knew how to 
<br>operate the weapon had also been killed, and he was the only 
<br>one who knew what to do. Although it detracted from their 
<br>initial training objective, the U.S. trainers taught everyone 
<br>in the ETIA to drive and to fire and maintain all of their 
<br>weapons systems. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) When asked from a non-scientific perspective to 
<br>rate ETIA 4 with other comparable army units,
<br> XXXXXXXXXXXX said that, based on 
<br>conversations with the Officer in Charge of 
<br>the September 2009 training of ETIA 1 (Bamako 538), he 
<br>believes that ETIA 4's capabilities are better overall. On a 
<br>scale of 1 to 10 compared to other forces in Africa and the 
<br>Middle East, including Iraqi Army regulars, ETIA 4 ranks 
<br>about 6 out of 10. This compares to Algerian Army regulars 
<br>that he ranked about 7 or 8. XXXXXXXXXXXX said that, with 
<br>maintenance of the skills they had learned during the JCET 
<br>and additional, follow-up training, ETIA 4 could easily 
<br>improve. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (S) The JCET moved on December 7-8 to Amakouladji, a 
<br>town approximately 35 kilometers north of Gao on the road to 
<br>Bourem. There, they conducted a live fire exercise with 
<br>rocket-propelled grenades and mortars at a firing range 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX said was safe and well-suited to simulate geographic 
<br>conditions in the North. In the town itself, they 
<br>distributed supplies to some 240 grateful primary school 
<br>students and vaccinated 250 farm animals. 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX and several of his men said they
<br> had seen no/no evidence of AQIM 
<br>surveillance or activity during the course of the five week 
<br>JCET. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (S) Although the JCET was an overall success, it was 
<br>not without problems. The 14 Landcruisers designated for 
<br>ETIA 4, that were part of the 37 the Ambassador handed over 
<br>to the Minister of Defense on October 20, did not show up in 
<br>Gao until the last week of the training. While the vehicles, 
<br>five equipped with Harris HF radios, are with the unit now, 
<br>and will move with the ETIA 4 back to Timbuktu, the hand held 
<br>radios that should also have been part of the ETIA 4 vehicle 
<br>allocation had not yet arrived. Only about two thirds of 
<br>the 160-strong unit were wearing the boots and desert 
<br>fatigues provided by the United States, but additional boots 
<br>and other equipment arrived on the CASA 212 flight from 
<br>Bamako the day of the ceremony. XXXXXXXXXXXX also said that the 
<br>Gao base commander had initially tried to keep him out of a 
<br>warehouse which stored replacement gun barrels and other 
<br>parts. He was told that the materiel was being held in 
<br>reserve, but he overcame the base commander's objections and 
<br>succeeded in procuring what was needed to replace broken or 
<br>missing equipment held by the ETIA. 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX was asked to make that part of his 
<br>report, as the Ambassador had raised 
<br>the problem with President Amadou Toumani Toure in September 
<br>(Bamako 619).
