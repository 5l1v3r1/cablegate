<br>CONFIDENCE IN ELECTION OUTCOME 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: DCM Nancy McEldowney for reasons 1.4 (b,d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Experts on civil-military relations in Ankara 
<br>contend the Turkish General Staff (TGS) is satisfied with the 
<br>process set in motion by its April 27 warning and the 
<br>Constitutional Court's subsequent decision on the presidency 
<br>vote which brought Turkey to early elections.  Analysts claim 
<br>that the military and pro-secular opposition parties, buoyed 
<br>by mass pro-secular demonstrations in May and June, believe 
<br>that even if the AKP emerges from July 22 elections able to 
<br>form a single-party government, it will be forced to accept a 
<br>consensus candidate for the presidency.  Despite these claims 
<br>of confidence, the military continues to work to exploit 
<br>debate over a cross-border operation against PKK terrorists, 
<br>as well as press allegations that the US is either directly 
<br>or indirectly providing weapons to the PKK, to make the AKP 
<br>government appear weak on security.  And of course there is 
<br>the possibility of a last ditch attempt by the military -- 
<br>via public statements, policy maneuvering, or partisan 
<br>manipulation -- to sway undecided voters towards secular 
<br>opposition parties.  Military reaction to the elections may 
<br>be affected by the TGS's all-consuming annual exercise of the 
<br>Supreme Military Council, which starts August 1.  End Summary 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) The crisis atmosphere following the TGS's April 27 
<br>warning, which led many to fear some kind of military 
<br>intervention, has been replaced by more traditional 
<br>politicking in the final stretch to July 22 national 
<br>elections.  After public sparring with the government in May 
<br>and June over who would take responsibility for a 
<br>cross-border operation against PKK terrorists in northern 
<br>Iraq -- designed to show the AKP government as soft on 
<br>terrorism -- the TGS has refrained from public statements on 
<br>domestic political issues for the past two weeks.  Chief of 
<br>Defense Gen Buyukanit and Deputy CHOD Saygun enjoyed 
<br>scheduled vacations on the coast in late June and early July. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) According to Ankara University professor Tanel 
<br>Demirel, the TGS achieved its primary short-term objective 
<br>via the April 27 announcement: preventing Abdullah Gul from 
<br>becoming president and ensuring a Constitutional Court ruling 
<br>raising the vote threshold for president to 367.  The head of 
<br>the secular and nationalist Ataturk Thought Association 
<br>(ADD), retired General Sener Eruygur, pointed to the large 
<br>turn-out at pro-secular rallies in Istanbul, Izmir and other 
<br>cities as proof pro-secular forces are rising to challenge 
<br>the AKP. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) Several observers, such as Bilkent University 
<br>professor and military analyst Umit Cizre, identify the 
<br>pivotal moment in the AKP's relations with the military as 
<br>the private May 4 meeting between PM Erdogan and CHOD 
<br>Buyukanit at the Dolmabahce palace in Istanbul.  Although 
<br>Cizre and other analysts are not sure what happened during 
<br>the 2.5 hour session, they conclude that Buyukanit and 
<br>Erdogan reached some understanding.  Ankara University 
<br>professor Nuran Yildiz believes Buyukanit made military "red 
<br>lines" over the presidency clear to Erdogan at that 
<br>encounter.  All agree that the situation relaxed considerably 
<br>after that. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) Analysts' views vary widely on the significance of the 
<br>military's April 27 internet warning that it was ready to 
<br>intervene to protect Turkey's secular democracy.  Cizre and 
<br>Demirel believe the April 27 statement was both harmful and 
<br>unnecessary since the Constitutional Court was poised anyway 
<br>to affirm a 367 quorum requirement for the presidency and 
<br>thus defeat Gul's candidacy, precipitating early elections. 
<br>Yildiz and others, including retired general Riza Kucukoglu 
<br>at Ankara's Eurasian Studies Institute (ASAM), assert the 
<br>military has played its role correctly in counterbalancing 
<br>AKP attempts to monopolize all major power centers.  Even 
<br>critics of the military's announcement, such as Ankara 
<br>University professor Bedriye Poyraz, believe that the AKP 
<br>provoked military intervention by blatant attempts to fill 
<br> 
<br>ANKARA 00001842  002 OF 002 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>the government bureaucracy with its supporters and its 
<br>ill-considered nomination of Gul for president.  They 
<br>acknowledge that, despite criticism of the military's 
<br>intervention by some intellectuals and pundits, most Turks 
<br>see it as natural, if not appropriate, for the generals to 
<br>make their political views known. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) Looking at post-election scenarios, most observers 
<br>with whom we have spoken tell us the military can live with 
<br>another AKP government, as long as the president is a secular 
<br>figure selected by consensus.  The prospect of the AKP 
<br>cooperating with independent Kurdish deputies in order to 
<br>form a government is more controversial, as this would bring 
<br>together the military and secular establishment's two 
<br>archenemies: "Islamists and separatists."  While Cizre 
<br>believes the generals could tolerate an alliance of AKP and 
<br>Kurdish independents as long as the president is secular, 
<br>ADD's Eruygur termed such an alliance a "nightmare" for 
<br>Turkey.  ASAM's Kucukoglu asserted that the military would be 
<br>uncomfortable with independent Kurdish MPs, citing their past 
<br>behavior (in the early 1990s, the previous iteration of 
<br>pro-Kurdish MPs attempted to take the parliamentary oath in 
<br>Turkish and made statements that triggered the lifting of 
<br>their parliamentary immunity and eventual prosecution).  He 
<br>claimed, however, that military coups are no longer 
<br>necessary, now that the majority of Turks who favor 
<br>secularism have found their voice. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) Comment: Despite analysts' claims of military 
<br>confidence, the generals are clearly working behind the 
<br>scenes, using ongoing PKK terrorism and the debate over the 
<br>necessity of a cross-border operation into northern Iraq to 
<br>portray the AKP as weak on terrorism.  We also detect the 
<br>military's hand behind recent allegations that the U.S. has, 
<br>either directly or indirectly, provided weapons to the PKK in 
<br>northern Iraq.   This is also designed to weaken AKP's 
<br>national security credentials and encourage undecided voters 
<br>to turn to "tougher" pro-secular parties.  While the military 
<br>could roil the waters and make a public statement on the 
<br>elections at any time, its post-election reaction may be 
<br>delayed by the August 1 start of annual, and all-consuming, 
<br>Supreme Military Council (YAS) promotions and assignments 
<br>deliberations.  End Comment.
