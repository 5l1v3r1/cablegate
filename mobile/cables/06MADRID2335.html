<br>TAGS: PREL MARR SP LE AF
<br>SUBJECT: SPAIN: MOD POLICY DIRECTOR ON NCIS/OSI,
<br>AFGHANISTAN, AND LEBANON
<br>
<br>Classified By: Charge Hugo Llorens for reasons 1.4 (b) & (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C/NF) Charge paid an introductory call on MOD Secretary
<br>General for Policy Admiral Francisco Torrente on September
<br>¶15. Charge told Torrente that the US deeply appreciates the
<br>hospitality and use of Spanish bases, as well as the strong
<br>foundation that the military-military relationship provides
<br>to the overall bilateral relationship. Torrente said that
<br>Spain is well aware that it is not the military equal of the
<br>US and that, because the relationship is necessarily unequal,
<br>Spain appreciates being acknowledged for its basing and other
<br>contributions to the defense relationship with close
<br>attention to form and public appearances.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C/NF) On the NCIS/OSI issue, Torrente emphasized that the
<br>GOS doesn't disagree with the DOD concept of force protection
<br>and doesn't want to restrict NCIS/OSI activities - it just
<br>wants to be involved in these activities from the start. He
<br>said that he believes that NCIS/OSI is not carrying out
<br>illegal activities, so there would be no reason for the GOS
<br>to prohibit any activity. Torrente said that NCIS/OSI is a
<br>tricky issue for the GOS, particularly because the press has
<br>mixed up NCIS/OSI with the CIA flights issues, and because
<br>radical parties that are the governing Socialist party's
<br>legislative partners in Parliament can be hard to control.
<br>Torrente acknowledged that the US may think that he is being
<br>stubborn on this issue, but they have to understand that he
<br>represents the GOS position. He said that he is glad that
<br>the USG has finally settled on an appropriate interlocutor
<br>(NOTE: DASD Dan Fata recently met with Torrente) and that he
<br>looks forward to seeing the small changes that OSD will
<br>propose to the current negotiating draft.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C/NF) In response to Charge's questions about the
<br>possibility that Spain could do more to support the NATO
<br>mission in Afghanistan, Torrente listed a number of the
<br>projects that Spain is working on in the area of its
<br>Provincial Reconstruction Team, including road building,
<br>paving the runway, distributing radios and broadcasting
<br>programs to the local population, and providing medical care.
<br>He said that he agreed with General Jones that more troops
<br>are needed but said that the ISAF mission can't be
<br>accomplished by eight nations alone, so other European
<br>countries need to contribute. Torrente agreed with Secretary
<br>Rice's call to attack drug production at its roots, noting
<br>that it would be a long-term project. He expects Spanish
<br>troops to be in Afghanistan for 15-20 years.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C/NF) Similarly, Torrente said that Spain expects to be
<br>in Lebanon for a long time, and therefore other European
<br>allies would need to rotate their troops in to support the
<br>UNIFIL mission. He specifically mentioned the Poles and
<br>their prior UNIFIL experience. Torrente also mentioned that
<br>while UNSCR 1701 is important, it doesn't fully address the
<br>issue of Hizballah, which is both a terrorist organization
<br>and part of the government. Torrente also talked about
<br>Spain's engagement with Syria, with whom he said Spain has
<br>good relations, and Iran, with which he said that relations
<br>were better under previous President Khatami.
