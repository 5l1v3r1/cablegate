<br>
<br>¶1. (U) Repsol and Shell will sell their joint 50% stake in
<br>natural gas development in Iran's South Pars block 14,
<br>according to reports in the Spanish business press. The two
<br>firms are reported to be negotiating an agreement with the
<br>GOI in which they would give up their concession in exchange
<br>for an agreement that would allow them to obtain concessions
<br>on other blocks that they could develop once the political
<br>situation is more stable. One article said Repsol and Shell
<br>were seeking concessions for blocks 23 and 24, which would be
<br>developed in the next decade. The firms also are reported to
<br>be working with the GOI to seek a partner -- possibly
<br>Russia's Gazprom, India's IOC, or a Chinese firm -- to take
<br>over the block 14 concession.
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) The press reports cited USG pressure and also
<br>technical/economic factors as having contributed to the
<br>decision. The GOI reportedly wants to develop block 14 as
<br>soon as possible, because it is near the border with Qatar
<br>and the GOI fears that the Qataris will extract most of the
<br>gas if Iranian development is delayed. Repsol and Shell
<br>reportedly did not want to begin the project in June, because
<br>the increase in construction costs of gas liquefication (LNG)
<br>plants would mean that they would want to renegotiate their
<br>existing contracts. One article said that the production
<br>from block 14 would now be used for the Iranian domestic
<br>market or for export by pipeline, rather than LNG export.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Comment: Repsol CEO Antonio Brufau had told the
<br>Ambassador April 28 that Repsol had decided to sell its
<br>concession options and that its board would vote that week to
<br>do so. Post has repeatedly emphasized to Repsol and to the
<br>GOS the USG's concerns about this project (reftels), and the
<br>decision is a sign that the pressure has paid off.
<br>Nonetheless, with Repsol reported not willing to completely
<br>cut ties to the GOI, we do not expect that this decision,
<br>however welcome, will lead to a major change in GOS views on
<br>hydrocarbons investment in Iran.
