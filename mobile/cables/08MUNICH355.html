<br>SUBJECT: GERMANY/BAVARIA: CSU HOPES FOR FRESH START WITH NEW AND
<br>YOUNGER FACES IN CABINETAND A DYNAMIC SECRETARY GENERAL 
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) Newly-elected Bavarian Minister-President Horst Seehofer
<br>(Christian Social Union - CSU) elevated youthful, female, and fresh
<br>faces in the presentation of his surprising cabinet choices on
<br>October 30. In a canny move, he also chose 36-year-old Bundestag
<br>member Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg as CSU Secretary General. This
<br>makes zu Guttenberg effectively the spokesman, television
<br>personality, and advisor to the CSU leadership. He is also a Berlin
<br>player, serving as the CSU's main foreign policy expert and member
<br>of the Bundestag Foreign Affairs Committee. (Note: While zu
<br>Guttenberg likely will choose to retain his Bundestag seat, his
<br>office at CSU headquarters in Munich told us said it is not clear
<br>whether he will remain on the Foreign Affairs Committee or switch to
<br>a committee oriented toward domestic affairs. End note.)
<br>Seehofer's choice underlines the CSU's claim to be more than just a
<br>regional party, particularly in view of the 2009 European Parliament
<br>and federal elections. The group (para 4 below) needs to appeal to
<br>skeptical citizenry if the CSU hopes to do better in European and
<br>Bundestag elections in 2009.
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) Complicating Seehofer's and the new cabinet's task is the
<br>new presence of three members of the coalition member Free
<br>Democratic Party (FDP) (one is a State Secretary), who will make
<br>their own attempts to strike a favorable profile. In all, Seehofer
<br>replaced sixteen of the eighteen cabinet positions with eight
<br>newcomers. He could be accused of ageism since he dismissed all CSU
<br>cabinet members over 60 years old, thus drastically reducing the
<br>government's age average below 50. Five cabinet members are women.
<br>Notably, the Landtag also elected its first female President, the
<br>64-year-old Barbara Stamm.
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) The new Bavarian cabinet will consist of the following
<br>members, all CSU unless otherwise noted as FDP:
<br>
<br>-Minister President: Horst Seehofer, 59, Upper Bavaria, elected on
<br>October 27 (new);
<br>-Minister of Economics and Deputy Minister President: Martin Zeil
<br>(FDP), 52, Upper Bavaria (new);
<br>--MOE State Secretary: Katja Hessel (FDP), 36, Middle Franconia
<br>(new);
<br>-Minister of Interior: Joachim Herrmann, 52, Middle Franconia (the
<br>incumbent);
<br>-MOI State Secretary: Bernd Weiss, 40, Lower Franconia (new);
<br>-Minister for Labor and Social Affairs: Christine Haderthauer, 47,
<br>Upper Bavaria (new, formerly General Secretary of the CSU);
<br>--State Secretary: Markus Sackmann, 47, Upper Palatinate (new);
<br>-Minister at the Bavarian State Chancery: Siegfried Schneider, 52,
<br>Upper Bavaria (new);
<br>-Minister for European and Federal Affairs: Emilia Mueller, 56,
<br>Upper Palatinate (new);
<br>-Minister of Finance: Georg Fahrenschon, 40, Upper Bavaria (new);
<br>--MOF State Secretary: Franz Josef Pschierer, 52, Suabia (new);
<br>-Minister of Environment: Markus Soeder, 41, Middle Franconia
<br>(new);
<br>--MOEnv State Secretary: Melanie Huml, 33, Upper Franconia (new);
<br>-Minister of Agriculture: Helmut Brunner, 54, Lower Bavaria (new);
<br>
<br>-Minister of Justice: Dr. Beate Merk, 51, Suabia;
<br>-Minister of Science: Dr. Wolfgang Heubisch (FDP), 62, Upper Bavaria
<br>(new);
<br>-Minister of Culture and Education: Ludwig Spaenle, 47, Upper
<br>Bavaria;
<br>--MOC&Ed State Secretary: Dr. Marcel Huber, 50, Upper Bavaria
<br>(new).

<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) Comment: Seehofer's cabinet is mainly remarkable for its
<br>youthful representation. We view the surprise nomination of
<br>Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg as Secretary General as a clever move,
<br>particularly in view of the CSU's claim of being more than just a
<br>regional Bavarian party. Zu Guttenberg is a foreign policy expert,
<br>a transatlanticist and a close and well-known friend to the United
<br>States and Mission Germany.
