<br>Classified By: P/E CHIEF SHUBLER, REASONS 1.4 (b) & (d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C/REL NATO) SUMMARY: Macedonia is in its 7th MAP cycle 
<br>and has made significant progress in meeting its defense 
<br>reform goals, but still falls short in terms of meeting 
<br>political and economic MAP criteria. To be considered a 
<br>strong candidate for NATO membership by mid-2007, with a view 
<br>to receiving an invitation in 2008, we believe Macedonia 
<br>should meet the following key criteria: 
<br>
<br>Strengthen democracy and the rule of law, and combat 
<br>corruption by : 
<br>
<br>--conducting free and fair parliamentary elections in 2006 
<br>that meet internationally-accepted standards; 
<br>
<br>--fully implementing the judicial reforms package to 
<br>strengthen the independence and efficiency of the judiciary; 
<br>and, 
<br>
<br>--showing significant progress in aggressively prosecuting 
<br>high-profile corruption cases. 
<br>
<br>Create a better business environment by: 
<br>
<br>--meeting the milestones established for World Bank-financed 
<br>projects on real estate and cadastre registration, and 
<br>implementing judicial reforms regarding contract enforcement; 
<br>and, 
<br>
<br>--completing in a transparent manner the privatization of the 
<br>state energy distribution and generation companies, with full 
<br>accountability for the use of funds derived from that action. 
<br>
<br>Continue defense reforms by: 
<br>
<br>--pursuing defense personnel downsizing while ensuring 
<br>equitable representation of ethnic minorities in the Armed 
<br>Forces, but in a manner that ensures qualified personnel are 
<br>selected and that training and promotion standards are not 
<br>lowered. 
<br>
<br>This message develops these key criteria further and 
<br>addresses additional political, economic, and defense issues 
<br>and goals. 
<br>
<br>End Summary. 
<br>
<br>KEY POLITICAL CRITERIA: 
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU/REL NATO) Electoral Reform: The 2005 local elections, 
<br>as noted by OSCE and other international and domestic 
<br>observers, were marred by serious electoral irregularities in 
<br>some areas, including ballot-stuffing, group voting, and some 
<br>election-day violence. Since then, the GOM has worked with 
<br>OSCE experts to draft an electoral code that addresses 
<br>electoral system concerns raised by the International 
<br>Community (IC) in relation to the 2005 and other past 
<br>elections. The electoral code is in the parliamentary review 
<br>process, and Parliament is expected to pass it by mid-March. 
<br>
<br>--Electoral Bodies: In addition to revising the electoral 
<br>code to strengthen administration of upcoming parliamentary 
<br>elections in summer 2006, the government recently addressed 
<br>long-held IC concerns regarding inadequate funding, housing, 
<br>equipment, and staffing for the State Electoral 
<br>Administration (SEC), which is responsible for administering 
<br>the elections. The SEC now has an adequate budget; initial 
<br>staffing; new offices; and sufficient equipment to allow it 
<br>to perform its core functions. The SEC Secretariat already 
<br>is undertaking planning and initial steps to prepare for the 
<br>2006 parliamentary elections. 
<br>
<br>--Parliamentary Elections: The key test of the strength of 
<br>Macedonia,s democratic system will be the 2006 parliamentary 
<br>elections. The IC is working with the government, political 
<br>party leaders and party cadres, and the state electoral 
<br>
<br>SKOPJE 00000105 002 OF 007 
<br>
<br>
<br>bodies to help ensure free and fair elections, as judged by 
<br>OSCE/ODIHR and other international and domestic monitors. 
<br>Key Message: Should Macedonia fail this task, it would call 
<br>into question the country,s readiness to present itself as a 
<br>strong candidate for a NATO membership invitation in 2008. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C/REL NATO) Judicial Reform: The Parliament in December 
<br>2005 passed a package of 11 constitutional amendments 
<br>strengthening the independence and efficiency of the 
<br>judiciary. The amendments sharply curtail the role of 
<br>Parliament in selecting judges, who will now be selected and 
<br>dismissed by an independent State Judicial Council. The 
<br>Parliament is expected to pass bylaws to implement the 
<br>amendments in the first half of 2006. Key Message: By 
<br>mid-2007, the government should have passed and implemented 
<br>the draft Law on Courts to allow trials of serious crimes and 
<br>organized crime cases, and should implement a court case 
<br>management system assigning cases to judges on a random 
<br>basis; implement and use the Law on Witness Protection as 
<br>appropriate in prosecuting organized crime cases; and enforce 
<br>asset forfeitures in money-laundering or other serious crime 
<br>cases. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C/REL NATO) Corruption: Macedonia was ranked 104 of 159 
<br>countries in the 2005 Transparency International annual 
<br>corruption perception index (CPI) report. It dropped several 
<br>places compared to 2004, although its overall score remained 
<br>the same, at 2.7 out of a possible 10 (10 being least 
<br>corrupt.). Combating corruption is one of the government,s 
<br>most daunting challenges; very few high-profile corruption 
<br>cases have been successfully prosecuted, with even fewer 
<br>cases involving a significant sentence as a sanction. Key 
<br>Message: To enhance Macedonia,s competitiveness as a NATO 
<br>candidate, the Macedonian Public Prosecutor,s office should 
<br>successfully prosecute 3-5 high-profile corruption cases by 
<br>mid-2007. In addition, the Macedonian courts should 
<br>demonstrate that they can try those high-profile corruption 
<br>cases in a fair and transparent fashion, as judged by 
<br>independent observers (local NGOs, OSCE Rule of Law experts), 
<br>and any guilty verdicts should be accompanied by sanctions 
<br>that will have a deterrent effect. 
<br>
<br>OTHER POLITICAL ISSUES AND GOALS 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C/REL NATO) Rule of Law: General rule of law weaknesses 
<br>hamper Macedonia,s ability to demonstrate progress in 
<br>meeting the political criteria of the NATO MAP process. The 
<br>Ministry of Interior,s Professional Standards Unit (PSU) has 
<br>investigated a number of allegations of police abuse, and has 
<br>sanctioned such abuse when it occurred. However, the PSU,s 
<br>record is inconsistent, and systems to ensure transparency in 
<br>the MOI are inadequate. Similarly, Macedonia,s fall from 
<br>Tier 1 to Tier 2 in the State Department,s annual 
<br>Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report for 2005 reflected lack 
<br>of political commitment to combat aggressively lucrative 
<br>organized crime activities, which was also reflected in the 
<br>GOM,s continuing lack of a National Action Plan for 
<br>combating TIP. The ability of defendants in civil lawsuits 
<br>to file interminable, frivolous appeals prevents the 
<br>Macedonian courts from enforcing valid judgments -- for 
<br>example, ordering the owner of Macedonian TV station &A-18 
<br>to repay debts owed to the U.S.-based non-profit Media Loan 
<br>Development Fund. By mid-2007, the MOI,s PSU should have 
<br>fully investigated and pressed charges, as applicable, in the 
<br>majority of alleged police abuse cases alleged to have 
<br>occurred in 2006; Macedonian authorities should ensure the 
<br>anti-TIP National Action Plan has been approved and 
<br>implemented, and Macedonia should demonstrate progress in 
<br>moving toward a Tier 1 rating in the annual TIP report for 
<br>¶2006. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU/REL NATO) Minority Rights: The final legislative 
<br>requirement of the 2001 Ohrid Framework Agreement (FWA) was 
<br>met in 2005, but implementation of FWA-mandated measures to 
<br>improve minority rights has been uneven. The government needs 
<br>to continue steady efforts to implement equitable 
<br>representation of minorities in public administration. At 
<br>the same time, the government (across ethnic lines) should 
<br>guard against fulfilling quotas at the expense of individual 
<br>
<br>SKOPJE 00000105 003 OF 007 
<br>
<br>
<br>capacity to perform a job. The GOM also should continue to 
<br>implement decentralization that empowers minorities at the 
<br>local level, and in a manner that presents Macedonia as a 
<br>regional model for consolidating stability through 
<br>strengthening inter-ethnic cooperation. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C/REL NATO) Neighborly Relations: Macedonia collaborates 
<br>actively with its neighbors and other countries in the 
<br>region, and should strive to export its experience as a 
<br>positive example of best practices in that regard. It is 
<br>working on resolving several outstanding bilateral issues, 
<br>including the name dispute with Greece (through talks under 
<br>UN auspices), and the question of demarcating its border with 
<br>Kosovo. The dispute between the Serbian Orthodox Church 
<br>(SOC) and the Macedonian Orthodox Church (MOC) over which 
<br>should enjoy primacy among orthodox Christian believers in 
<br>Macedonia remains a challenge for the government, which is 
<br>working on a draft law on religious communities that would 
<br>make it possible for the SOC to officially register as a 
<br>religious group in Macedonia. The imprisonment last year of 
<br>a SOC Bishop (&Bishop Jovan8) on grounds of inciting 
<br>religious hatred for publishing a calendar was roundly 
<br>criticized by the international community and many human 
<br>rights NGOs. The government should work to ensure passage of 
<br>the draft Law on Religious Communities that would help ease 
<br>tensions between the MOC and the SOC by allowing an 
<br>SOC-affiliated group to receive legal protection as a 
<br>recognized religious group in Macedonia. The government also 
<br>should continue to work on resolving the name dispute with 
<br>Greece through the talks being held under UN auspices. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU/REL NATO) Border Issues: The only remaining 
<br>contentious border issue is, as mentioned above, the 
<br>unresolved demarcation of Macedonia,s boundary with Kosovo, 
<br>which was delineated in a 2001 agreement between Belgrade and 
<br>Skopje. Pristina does not recognize the 2001 agreement, and 
<br>is unwilling to consider demarcating the border with 
<br>Macedonia until after final status is resolved. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C/REL NATO) POW and Holocaust Issues: There are no 
<br>unresolved POW issues. The government receives high marks 
<br>from the Israeli government and in the State Department,s 
<br>International Religious Freedom report for handling Jewish 
<br>community restitution issues. Ground-breaking for a 
<br>Holocaust memorial site in downtown Skopje took place in 
<br>2005, and Jewish community representatives generally express 
<br>satisfaction with the government,s actions to resolve 
<br>outstanding property claims. 
<br>
<br>KEY ECONOMIC CRITERIA: 
<br>
<br>¶10. (SBU/REL NATO) Business Climate: The government has made 
<br>significant economic reform progress in a number of areas, 
<br>including recent implementation of a &one-stop shop window8 
<br>that has significantly reduced the time required for 
<br>registering a new business. However, more needs to be done 
<br>to create an economic climate that will attract increased 
<br>investment (FDI was slightly lower in 2005 than in the 
<br>previous year) and bring official unemployment figures down 
<br>from their current high of 37 percent (taking the grey 
<br>economy into account, the actual rate is closer to 25 
<br>percent). 
<br>
<br>¶11. (SBU/REL NATO) Macro-Economic Achievements: The 
<br>government,s most significant economic achievement has been 
<br>the maintenance of fiscal discipline, combined with 
<br>consistent macroeconomic stability. The economy has grown at 
<br>a consistent rate of 2 to 4 percent from 2002 to 2005. The 
<br>government budget deficit is low (-0.6% in 2005), inflation 
<br>minimal (0.5% in 2005), the currency is stable, and the level 
<br>of debt-to-GDP (40%) is manageable. In 2005, the Government 
<br>signed agreements for three-year programs with both the 
<br>International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank. Both 
<br>Standard & Poor,s and Fitch Rating Service rated Macedonia 
<br>at or near investment grade for sovereign debt. In December 
<br>2005, Macedonia successfully sold 150 million euros worth of 
<br>euro bonds and used the proceeds to purchase its London Club 
<br>debt in order to lower its debt servicing costs. 
<br>
<br>
<br>SKOPJE 00000105 004 OF 007 
<br>
<br>
<br>¶12. (SBU/REL NATO) Foreign Investment & Economic Freedom: 
<br>Despite significant progress, business investment, both 
<br>domestic and foreign, is low; the current account deficit is 
<br>relatively high; and GDP growth rate is not strong enough to 
<br>significantly lower unemployment or the poverty rate. 
<br>Macedonia ranks 57th in the Heritage Foundation,s 2005 Index 
<br>of Economic Freedom, behind A-3 partners Albania (52nd) and 
<br>Croatia (55th). If the government fails to take the 
<br>following steps, among others, to enhance the business 
<br>climate, FDI levels and economic growth will remain anemic: 
<br>
<br>--Key Message: Business environment ) the government should 
<br>meet the milestones for World Bank-financed project on real 
<br>estate and cadastre registration, and implement judicial 
<br>reforms regarding contract enforcement. 
<br>
<br>--Key Message: Privatization ) the GOM should privatize the 
<br>energy distribution (ESM) and generation (ELEM) companies in 
<br>a transparent manner and should fully account for the use of 
<br>funds derived from that action. It also should sell its 
<br>remaining shares in the privatized Macedonian 
<br>Telecommunication company. 
<br>
<br>KEY DEFENSE CRITERIA: 
<br>
<br>¶13. (C/REL NATO) Overall Progress. Macedonia continues to 
<br>progress well on defense reforms. In 2005, Macedonia met its 
<br>goal of restructuring 60% of the Army of the Republic of 
<br>Macedonia's (ARM's) units in accordance with their Strategic 
<br>Defense Review (SDR). By the end of 2006, the GOM expects 
<br>90% of the ARM,s units will have been restructured. 
<br>
<br>¶14. (C/REL NATO) Additional defense reform milestones 
<br>completed under a dynamic and proactive CHOD include: 
<br>reorganization of the General Staff and 1st Mechanized 
<br>Infantry Brigade; transfer of the Air Force to the ARM's Air 
<br>Wing; and establishment of the Joint Operations Command as 
<br>the ARM's Maneuver Force Headquarters. The ARM also took the 
<br>first steps in 2005 toward assuming full host nation support 
<br>responsibilities by assigning officers and Non-Commissioned 
<br>Officers (NCOs) to NATO Headquarters-Skopje. The MOD will 
<br>establish a Host Nation Coordination Center by mid-2006. 
<br>
<br>¶15. (C/REL NATO) Personnel Reductions: The Ministry of 
<br>Defense (MOD) and ARM have been less successful in carrying 
<br>out the personnel reductions called for in the SDR. To date, 
<br>they have made the easy cuts, mostly personnel transfers. 
<br>For example, the MOD gave up the border security mission to 
<br>the new Border Police. It also divested itself of the people 
<br>and offices that are now independent governmental agencies, 
<br>such as the Rescue and Protection Directorate and the Crisis 
<br>Management Center. The MOD must cut approximately 1,200 
<br>military and civilian personnel to complete its personnel 
<br>reductions plan. The new draft Law on Defense will open up 
<br>the possibility of retiring excess officers with 25 years of 
<br>service, but that measure does not apply to the civilians at 
<br>the Ministry. 
<br>
<br>¶16. (C/REL NATO) Equitable Representation: Equitable 
<br>representation of minorities in the armed forces continues to 
<br>increase. Ethnic Albanians, for example, now constitute 
<br>nearly 12 percent of the total force; the percentage is 
<br>higher among the NCOs (15 percent) and soldiers (16 percent). 
<br>However, there is clear evidence that the coalition ethnic 
<br>Albanian governing party (DUI) is pressuring the military to 
<br>accelerate the pace of integration, especially within the 
<br>officer and NCO ranks, even if that means lowering standards 
<br>for promotions and professional development courses. Key 
<br>Message: The government, including its ethnic Albanian 
<br>coalition partners, should be reminded that equitable 
<br>representation, which we support, nevertheless must not be 
<br>implemented by placing unqualified personnel in positions of 
<br>responsibility. 
<br>
<br>¶17. (C/REL NATO) Defense Spending. Macedonia continues to 
<br>devote between 2.2-2.4 percent of its GDP to defense 
<br>spending. This year the defense budget is 6.201 billion 
<br>Macedonian denars (approximately 124 million USD), about 2.25 
<br>percent of GDP. Although that figure is two million dollars 
<br>
<br>SKOPJE 00000105 005 OF 007 
<br>
<br>
<br>less than in 2005, it represents a net increase, since 
<br>spending on functions such as border security and crisis 
<br>management are no longer part of the MOD 's budget. Defense 
<br>spending is expected to remain consistent in the near to 
<br>mid-term; this predictability is assisting the MOD in 
<br>managing its defense modernization programs for at least the 
<br>next five years. 
<br>
<br>¶18. (C/REL NATO) Modernization. Macedonia has offered NATO 
<br>eleven (11) units under the NATO Operational Capabilities 
<br>Concept, ranging from an infantry company to a special forces 
<br>company, helicopter detachment, engineer platoon, and 
<br>demining squad. Some of these units are ready now; others 
<br>will not be fully operational until the end of 2007. The ARM 
<br>is rightly focusing its resources, both domestic and 
<br>international, on getting these units fully operational, both 
<br>in terms of equipment and training. The U.S. will provide $5 
<br>million in Foreign Military Funding in FY06, most of which is 
<br>also being targeted for these "declared" units. One million 
<br>U.S. dollars in Global Peace Operations Initiative funds have 
<br>also become available, which the ARM would like to spend on 
<br>readying their military police battalion for deployment. 
<br>Macedonia also is an active participant in the Partnership 
<br>for Peace (PfP), participating in over 15 different exercises 
<br>in 2005, including hosting NATO's "Cooperative Associate" 
<br>Exercise in Skopje last November. 
<br>
<br>¶19. (C/REL NATO) Global War on Terrorism (GWOT). Macedonia 
<br>continues to be a net contributor to security, its armed 
<br>forces earning high marks for their performance in GWOT 
<br>operations. Macedonia,s troop contributions to the GWOT 
<br>demonstrate that it can be a meaningful contributor as a 
<br>future NATO member country as well. In December 2005, 
<br>Macedonia increased its participation in Iraq by deploying 
<br>five more staff officers above its normal 35-man rotation. 
<br>In Afghanistan, it is deploying eleven officers/NCOs with the 
<br>Headquarters of the Southeastern Europe Brigade (SEEBRIG), 
<br>rotating its four medical personnel with the Adriatic 
<br>Charter's Joint Medical Team, and increasing from 19 to 21 
<br>the personnel it has attached to the German Battle Group in 
<br>Kabul. By the end of February, Macedonia will have increased 
<br>its contribution to NATO Operations in Afghanistan from 23 
<br>personnel to 36. Including the personnel assigned to Iraq 
<br>and U.S. Central Command Headquarters, it will soon have a 
<br>total of 78 personnel deployed overseas. That figure 
<br>represents a considerable commitment for Macedonia. While we 
<br>expect the GOM to remain committed to participating in 
<br>international military operations, the ARM will continue in 
<br>the future to have to rely on other countries for strategic 
<br>transport and logistical support in-theater. 
<br>
<br>¶20. (C/REL NATO) Interoperability with NATO. The combined 
<br>effect of six ARM rotations in Iraq, eight ARM rotations in 
<br>Afghanistan, PfP exercises, and U.S. FMF/IMET support has 
<br>directly improved the ARM's capabilities and interoperability 
<br>with NATO. Not every unit of the ARM has benefited from this 
<br>exposure, however. Many conscript units focus mainly on 
<br>fulfilling garrison duties. Nevertheless, the performance of 
<br>Macedonian units in Iraq and Afghanistan has been exemplary, 
<br>and should be taken as a demonstration of the ARM's potential 
<br>as a future NATO member. 
<br>
<br>¶21. (C/REL NATO) Crisis Management Center: To get the MOD out 
<br>of direct involvement in managing crisis management 
<br>operations, the government created the civilian-run Crisis 
<br>Management Center (CMC) in 2005. The CMC received an 
<br>independent budget in January 2006, but squabbles between the 
<br>ethnic Albanian CMC Director and the government over 
<br>equitable representation in staffing the center have 
<br>prevented it from becoming fully operational. In a region 
<br>plagued by frequent floods and occasional earthquakes, the 
<br>country,s lack of effective crisis management capacity is 
<br>unacceptable. Key Message: The CMC should be adequately 
<br>staffed, fully operational, and capable of responding to 
<br>disasters by mid-2007. Although equitable representation 
<br>should be considered in deciding on personnel, the Center 
<br>should be staffed by qualified personnel. 
<br>
<br>LEGAL ISSUES: 
<br>
<br>SKOPJE 00000105 006 OF 007 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶22. (SBU/REL NATO) There are no significant constitutional or 
<br>legal barriers that would prevent Macedonia,s accession to 
<br>NATO or its participation in NATO operations. The Macedonian 
<br>constitution provides that the Parliament can approve 
<br>proposals to join international organizations by a majority 
<br>vote. Participation in peacekeeping operations outside the 
<br>country requires the approval of a majority in Parliament, 
<br>and the government can decide to participate in exercises or 
<br>humanitarian operations without Parliament,s approval. Upon 
<br>ratification of an accession agreement, the Law on Defense 
<br>would have to be amended to harmonize Macedonian law with 
<br>NATO,s collective defense provisions, according to 
<br>Macedonia,s ANP. 
<br>
<br>SECURITY/INTELLIGENCE ISSUES: 
<br>
<br>¶23. (C/REL NATO) The Law on Classified Information was passed 
<br>in March 2005, expanding the responsibilities of the 
<br>Directorate for Security of Classified Information to include 
<br>all classified information exchanged between the Republic of 
<br>Macedonia and foreign countries or international 
<br>organizations. According to the government, the provisions 
<br>of the Law on Classified Information are consistent with NATO 
<br>Security Policy requirements. In addition, the government is 
<br>drafting guidelines for Security Officers charged by various 
<br>state institutions to ensure the bylaws of the Law on 
<br>Classified Information are implemented within those 
<br>institutions. In practice, however, political control over 
<br>Macedonian intelligence and security agencies results in 
<br>occasional leaks of sensitive information to political 
<br>parties. 
<br>
<br>¶24. (C/REL NATO) Macedonia,s three intelligence services 
<br>(Macedonian Intelligence Agency, subordinate to the 
<br>President; military intelligence; and the MOI,s 
<br>counter-intelligence agency) do not cooperate closely and are 
<br>hampered by outmoded missions. 
<br>
<br>PUBLIC SUPPORT: 
<br>
<br>¶25. (SBU/REL NATO) Public support for NATO membership is 
<br>strong ) 90 percent in a poll conducted in January (among 
<br>ethnic Albanians, that figure reaches 96 percent.) No 
<br>government or opposition Member of Parliament has voted 
<br>against a deployment of Macedonian troops overseas to support 
<br>alliance operations in Iraq or Afghanistan. Prudent 
<br>expectations management -- on the part of the government, 
<br>USG, and NATO -- will help ensure strong public support 
<br>through the Riga Summit and well into 2007. 
<br>
<br>WATCH OUT FORS: 
<br>
<br>¶26. (C) The case of Khalid el-Masri, a German citizen of 
<br>Lebanese descent who claims he was flow by the CIA from 
<br>Macedonia to Afghanistan for interrogation, has generated 
<br>intense press commentary here, most of it negative, over the 
<br>past several months. Opposition parties and opinion-shapers 
<br>accuse the government of jeopardizing Macedonia,s EU 
<br>accession chances by refusing to comprehensively answer 
<br>Council of Europe and European Parliament requests for a full 
<br>accounting in the case. Relevant government authorities have 
<br>responded carefully to COE and EU requests for information, 
<br>consistently explaining that they have little information to 
<br>provide on el-Masri and his allegations. There has been some 
<br>mention in the press of alleged secret CIA prisons on 
<br>Macedonian soil, but those stories have not had the same 
<br>staying power as the el-Masri case. 
<br>
<br>¶27. (C/NOFORN) Macedonia signed an Article 98 agreement with 
<br>us in 2003, and the government has expressed concern that it 
<br>eventually will come under strong EU pressure to abrogate 
<br>that agreement as it works on bring its legislation into 
<br>compliance with the EU acquis communautaire. The matter is 
<br>treated as a mid-to-long term issue in Macedonia,s EU 
<br>membership action plan, but could come up in the course of 
<br>future discussions. 
<br>
<br>¶28. (C/REL NATO) The government will press for a positive 
<br>
<br>SKOPJE 00000105 007 OF 007 
<br>
<br>
<br>statement at the Riga Summit, possibly singling out Macedonia 
<br>as a leading NATO membership candidate due to its defense and 
<br>political reform achievements, and assuring aspirants that 
<br>enlargement will be on the agenda in 2008.
