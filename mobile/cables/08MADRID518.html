<br>Classified By: CHARGE D'AFFAIRES HUGO LLORENS, REASONS 1.4(B) AND (D).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) WHA Assistant Secretary Tom Shannon visited Madrid
<br>April 30-May 1, 2008. He met with Secretary General of the
<br>Presidency Bernardino Leon and former President Jose Maria
<br>Aznar. He also attended a lunch in his honor hosted by
<br>Charge d' Affaires Hugo Llorens with Spanish private sector,
<br>media, and government experts on Latin America and gave
<br>interviews to daily El Pais and with Antena 3 TV. Leon
<br>stressed the need for the U.S. and Spain to work together in
<br>Latin America. Aznar emphasized the importance of Colombia
<br>and Mexico and urged the U.S. to maintain strong support for
<br>both. Both Leon and Aznar expressed concerns about Argentina.
<br>
<br>Leon Stresses Desire to Work with U.S. in Latin America
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) A/S Shannon and CDA Llorens met April 30 with newly
<br>installed Secretary General of the Presidency (and former MFA
<br>number two) Bernardino Leon. A/S Shannon told Leon the U.S.
<br>wanted to maintain continuity in policy towards Latin America
<br>through the next Administration. He emphasized the
<br>importance of strategic partners such as Spain, and thanked
<br>Leon for the effort he and MFA Secretary of State Trinidad
<br>Jimenez had made to work with the U.S. Leon said President
<br>Zapatero would need to make Latin America a foreign policy
<br>priority and work it intensively. He suggested this was an
<br>area where Spain and the U.S. should coordinate closely and
<br>at the most senior levels. He said the strategic effort
<br>should be to work closely with countries such as Brazil,
<br>Chile, Colombia, and Mexico. Looking ahead to the new
<br>Zapatero administration, Leon predicted the opposition
<br>Popular Party (PP) might be more conciliatory than in the
<br>past. He said Zapatero would put more emphasis on foreign
<br>policy, and he stressed that good relations with the U.S.
<br>would be a priority. Leon mentioned he had met recently with
<br>foreign policy advisors to all three U.S. Presidential
<br>candidates. He suggested both governments should begin
<br>thinking about a meeting between Presidents Bush and Zapatero
<br>in September at the UNGA. Leon noted that this meeting with
<br>A/S Shannon was the first he had held with anyone outside the
<br>Spanish Government since assuming his new post.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) A/S Shannon explained the U.S. was looking forward to
<br>two key events: the OAS General Assembly (OASGA) in Medellin
<br>in June 2008 where the Deputy Secretary would lead the U.S.
<br>delegation and the Summit of the Americas in Trinidad and
<br>Tobago in April 2009. He noted Mexico and others were
<br>working to reduce tensions between Colombia and Ecuador in
<br>advance of the OASGA as well as to avoid disruptions by
<br>Venezuelan President Chavez. A/S Shannon said the Summit of
<br>the Americas would be the new U.S. President's first
<br>multilateral event with Latin America, and a major goal would
<br>be to put the summit process back on a positive track after
<br>the Mar de Plata experience. He indicated the Administration
<br>would continue to push its free trade agenda.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Leon said Argentina was very worrisome. Spanish
<br>companies in Argentina were concerned by the populist tone of
<br>the government, political polarization, and the level of
<br>corruption. There were "complicated" people and movements
<br>around the presidency. He suggested some lived by the old
<br>adage that "a politician who is poor is a poor politician."
<br>He said there was much work for Spain and the U.S. to do with
<br>respect to Argentina and complemented President Bush for
<br>setting a positive tone with President Cristina Fernandez
<br>Kirchner. A/S Shannon mentioned that he had recently visited
<br>Argentina and that in June a USG team would visit Buenos
<br>Aires to reinitiate the lapsed high-level dialogue. The goal
<br>was to define the bilateral relationship by shared interests
<br>rather than by differences. He predicted strife between
<br>various Argentine sectors was just beginning; the
<br>agricultural strike was merely the first round. He said the
<br>Peronist tendency once a crisis was past was to look for
<br>wealth and figure out how to spend it. Ironically, the more
<br>complicated internal situation might lead the government to
<br>seek to mend fences internationally. He said the costs of
<br>too close association with Chavez were now clear to the GOA,
<br>as evidenced by Chavez's recent decision to nationalize the
<br>Argentine firm SIDOR.
<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Leon said Spain hoped to use the EU-Latin America and
<br>the Caribbean summit in Lima in May to seek a trade pact
<br>where those Latin American countries who wanted in could be
<br>in and those who wanted out could stay out. The goal was to
<br>keep a country like Bolivia or Ecuador from dragging down the
<br>others. A/S Shannon noted this might help with the U.S.
<br>Congress on the free trade issue.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Leon said a post-Uribe Colombia raised concerns,
<br>although there were sensible people on the left (e.g., Polo
<br>Democratico leader Gaviria). He noted that post-Uribe,
<br>especially if the situation in Peru deteriorated, the Andean
<br>region would be even more problematic. He said Peru was a
<br>very key country.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Leon said he was worried about Bolivia and the threat
<br>to Spanish business interests there. He predicted Morales
<br>would lose the May 4 referendum. A/S Shannon said the U.S.
<br>was looking past May 4 and talking to the group of friends
<br>(Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia) as well as the Vatican. He
<br>predicted the referendum results would provide greater
<br>legitimacy to the state governors and blunt the GOB's
<br>criticism of the opposition and the U.S. (he noted wryly that
<br>the GOB had blasted the U.S. Ambassador at the same time the
<br>Bolivian FM was in the U.S. seeking USG assistance). A/S
<br>Shannon said the governors needed to exercise caution and not
<br>be overly aggressive. The U.S. message was that we supported
<br>dialogue but not secession. He doubted secession would come
<br>to pass. He said the U.S. was also talking to the armed
<br>forces and urging them to work within the constitution. He
<br>noted the military understood the risk to it as an
<br>institution. Leon asked if the GOB was arming civilians.
<br>A/S Shannon replied that some such activity was possible, but
<br>he doubted it was on a large scale. He said some Morales
<br>advisors might be pushing confrontation in order to paint the
<br>provinces as rebellious, but the U.S. message was that the
<br>provinces had to work within the confines of the law. He
<br>noted the Bolivian FM was in Washington recently and tried
<br>without success to interest the OAS Permanent Council in a
<br>resolution condemning the provinces. Leon said Spain's
<br>message was complimentary: territorial integrity but respect
<br>for the provinces as political units.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) A/S Shannon noted New Mexico Governor Richardson had
<br>recently visited Caracas in connection with the three
<br>Americans in the hands of the FARC. Chavez told him the U.S.
<br>should help Morales and work with the governors to make sure
<br>Morales was not backed into a corner. This was unusual given
<br>Venezuela had in the past urged on Morales. It appeared
<br>Chavez might be genuinely worried about the turn matters
<br>could take in Bolivia. Leon said he too was nervous about
<br>the situation. He noted Spain would regard a deployment of
<br>troops or police to the oil installations as a very bad sign.
<br>
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Leon said it was essential that the next Iberoamerican
<br>summit (El Salvador in November 2008) move beyond the famous
<br>incident in Chile between King Juan Carlos and Chavez. He
<br>mentioned Zapatero would see Chavez in Lima to try and set
<br>the stage for a more positive summit. Regardless, there were
<br>no guarantees someone would not seek confrontation in El
<br>Salvador.
<br>
<br>Aznar Looks to Colombia and Mexico
<br>----------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) A/S Shannon and CDA Llorens also met April 30 with
<br>former President Jose Maria Aznar. Aznar said he was worried
<br>about Latin America. He described what he called an
<br>anti-NAFTA, anti-Colombia FTA theme in the U.S. Presidential
<br>primaries. At the same time, he criticized an excessive
<br>emphasis on free trade and open markets in dealing with Latin
<br>America. Both were fundamental, but the U.S. also needed to
<br>focus on how it could isolate Chavez and also should keep a
<br>wary eye on Chinese and Muslim influence in Venezuela. He
<br>argued the U.S. and the EU needed to articulate a policy more
<br>understandable to the common people and more comprehensive.
<br>A/S Shannon agreed on the need to support civil society and
<br>NGOs in Latin America. He said many people in the U.S. had a
<br>
<br>view of Latin America frozen in the 1990s, but the region was
<br>changing rapidly. The U.S. and Spain should be looking for
<br>catalytic ways of supporting democratic governance, civil
<br>society, and economic development. He noted that in the past
<br>the U.S. had sometimes ignored Latin America until a crisis
<br>arose; in contrast, President Bush had a record of solid
<br>engagement in the region.
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Aznar mentioned he had spoken with Mexican President
<br>Calderon before the New Orleans summit and Calderon had
<br>expressed concern about waning Congressional support for
<br>NAFTA and the Merida initiative. Aznar said failure of the
<br>Colombia FTA would be catastrophic. He said Uribe was the
<br>best friend the U.S. had in Latin America, and the end of the
<br>FARC was in sight. He noted both Chavez and Ecuadorian
<br>President Correa were implicated by information obtained as a
<br>result of the GOC operation against Raul Reyes. It was more
<br>important now than ever for the U.S. to support Colombia.
<br>Aznar said Colombia and Mexico were the key countries in the
<br>region. Aznar said the U.S. and Spain should be working
<br>together to get Mexico to be more active regionally.
<br>Although Brazilian regional engagement was positive, it
<br>needed to be complemented by more Mexican engagement. He
<br>urged the U.S. to continue supporting both Colombia and
<br>Mexico, saying that if Calderon and Uribe were successful, it
<br>would shift the entire region in a positive direction. A/S
<br>Shannon briefed Aznar on the Administration's continuing
<br>efforts to win approval for the FTA with Colombia as well as
<br>the Merida initiative, which represented a very constructive
<br>U.S. response to the concerns of Mexico and Central America
<br>regarding security and law enforcement. He also briefed
<br>Aznar on the New Orleans meetings and the emphasis Presidents
<br>Bush and Calderon and PM Harper put on a common vision for
<br>trade, security, and border management.
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Despite his worries for the region, Aznar noted many
<br>countries were doing well. He cited Chile, Panama, and Peru.
<br>Aznar said the electoral results in Paraguay were a good
<br>step; the ideological leanings of the new government would
<br>not make much of a difference. Aznar said Brazil appeared to
<br>have put populism firmly behind it. He described Lula as a
<br>mainstream figure, albeit one who presented a friendlier face
<br>to the disadvantaged. He urged that the U.S. and Spain
<br>support good governance regardless of whether it came from
<br>the left or the right.
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Aznar said the situation in Argentina was very
<br>complicated. They appeared to be reverting to the vicious
<br>cycles of Peronism in which sectors with money were shaken
<br>down by the government. One interesting sign was the
<br>emergence of a more critical middle class, but Cristina
<br>Fernandez Kirchner was a disappointment. He had once hoped
<br>she would conduct a more sophisticated foreign policy, but
<br>she appeared now to be a puppet of her husband. A/S Shannon
<br>said Argentina was underperforming in terms of attracting
<br>foreign investment and was conducting an erroneous foreign
<br>policy. The last six years had seen economic improvement,
<br>but the Peronists again seemed to be looking for the money.
<br>Aznar agreed the growth had been notable, sustained in large
<br>part by favorable international commodity prices, but he said
<br>the recovery remained fragile. The GOA lacked credibility
<br>with the international business community, and the Argentine
<br>banking sector was weak. A/S Shannon hoped Argentina had
<br>learned a lesson from Venezuela's nationalization of the
<br>steel company SIDOR. Playing with Chavez was a good way to
<br>get burned. Nevertheless, he noted the GOA, for all its
<br>faults, was not in the same camp as Chavez. A/S Shannon and
<br>Aznar agreed it was important for the U.S. and Spain to
<br>remain actively engaged with the GOA and maintain a dialogue
<br>with it. A/S Shannon noted his recent visit there and the
<br>resumption of a regular, formal dialogue between the USG and
<br>GOA. Aznar applauded the initiative.
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) Aznar praised President Bush's strong stance in
<br>support of a democratic transition in Cuba and his most
<br>recent speech on the subject. He said we needed to monitor
<br>carefully the steps Raul Castro was taking, some of which
<br>were in the right direction. Nevertheless, both the U.S. and
<br>the EU needed to stay on the record as promoting democratic
<br>transition and openly supporting civil society and the
<br>
<br>dissidents. A/S Shannon noted the GOC was attempting to
<br>isolate the U.S. Aznar said anything the U.S., EU, and Spain
<br>could do to publicize the truth on Cuba would help. He cited
<br>the recent crackdown on the Damas de Blanco, noting the news
<br>in Cuba was more than just cell phones and computers. The
<br>public needed to know what was really happening. He said
<br>that was the way to keep the pressure on Raul Castro, whom he
<br>said should not be allowed to consolidate power. Fidel would
<br>continue to be an immobilizing element as long as he lived,
<br>but when he died, it might set in motion events Raul could
<br>not control.
<br>
<br>Experts' Lunch
<br>--------------
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) Lunch at the CDA's residence brought together a
<br>variety of Latin America experts: Roman Escolano of BBVA;
<br>Jaime Malet of the Amcham; Alberto Carnero of FAES; Asis
<br>Martin de Cabiedes of Europa Press, Juan Luis Cebrian of
<br>Grupo Prisa, and Eduardo San Martin of ABC; and Javier
<br>Sandomingo, MFA Director General for Iberoamerica. The
<br>discussion was off the record and vigorous. Topics included
<br>Cuba, Venezuela, Mexico, the Colombia FTA, and Argentina.
<br>Sandomingo made a point of saying during the lunch and again
<br>afterwards in private that Spain would strongly prefer the
<br>U.S. did not try to split EU opinion on Cuba. A/S Shannon
<br>emphasized the need for the international community to work
<br>together for meaningful democratic change and to continue to
<br>reach out to civil society and the dissidents. Several of
<br>the guests unconsciously echoed Leon's and Aznar's concerns
<br>about Argentina. Views on Venezuela were negative,
<br>especially on the economic situation. A/S Shannon used the
<br>opportunity to describe the Merida initiative, and he heard
<br>strong expressions of support for a U.S. FTA with Colombia.
<br>
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) We were especially struck by the emphasis Bernardino
<br>Leon laid on cooperation with the U.S. in Latin America. His
<br>move from MFA to the Presidency is rumored to have been
<br>prompted by Zapatero's dissatisfaction with the functioning
<br>of his first-term foreign policy apparatus. Reportedly his
<br>"odd man out" experience at the NATO Summit in Bucharest was
<br>the last straw. Leon is a credible player on foreign affairs
<br>and well-disposed towards the U.S. Having him in a key
<br>position at the Presidency bodes well as does the resonance
<br>of Spanish views with our own on most things Latin American.
<br>Cuba will continue to be the exception, at least when it
<br>comes to tactics, but on a great many other important issues
<br>in the Western Hemisphere we believe Spain is genuinely
<br>interested in working with the U.S. and highly values A/S
<br>Shannon's continuing attention. Aznar remains well-briefed
<br>on Latin America, knows the players, and frequently travels
<br>to the region, all good reasons for U.S. officials to stay in
<br>touch with him.
