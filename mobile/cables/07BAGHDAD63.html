<br>¶C. C) 2006 BAGHDAD 4763 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) Summary: In a January 4 meeting with Iraq's Sunni Vice 
<br>President Tariq al-Hashemi (Iraqi Islamic Party ) IIP), the 
<br>Ambassador briefed him on the new Baghdad security plan and 
<br>solicited the VP's support. Al-Hashemi welcomed a new plan 
<br>to curb Baghdad violence, requested Shia and Sunni balance 
<br>within the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) manning checkpoints, 
<br>and agreed that an increased number of MNF-I troops are 
<br>needed in order for the plan to succeed. Discussing a 
<br>possible cabinet change, the VP said that Prime Minister 
<br>Maliki has not approached him about changing any of Tawafuq's 
<br>(Sunni Coalition) Ministers or their Deputy Prime Minister. 
<br>Al-Hashemi stressed that before Tawafuq agrees to change its 
<br>Ministers, the Minister of Defense, Abdul Qadir Mohammed 
<br>al-Mufriji, (Sunni ) Independent ) Tawafuq) must be 
<br>replaced with another Tawafuq candidate. The VP criticized 
<br>the way the GOI executed Saddam and expressed concern that 
<br>because of their actions the reconciliation project is now 
<br>"dead." On the moderate front, al-Hashemi said that during 
<br>his recent trip to Sulaymaniyah with President Talabani he 
<br>had agreed to change IIP's conditions (reftel) to a program 
<br>for the coalition to address. However, the VP warned, the PM 
<br>has been unable to convince Dawa to support the coalition. 
<br>The Ambassador and VP discussed how to address the issue of 
<br>GOI officials with close ties to foreign countries, such as 
<br>Iran, with the VP recommending that the GOI "start from 
<br>scratch" and hold new elections. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------- 
<br>The Baghdad Security Plan: Al-Hashemi Offers Support 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) The Ambassador outlined the chief components of the 
<br>new Baghdad Security Plan and called on the VP to support the 
<br>PM and this plan. First, Coalition Forces (CF) and Iraqi 
<br>Security Forces (ISF) will pursue anyone who breaks the law. 
<br>There will be no sanctuary anywhere in greater Baghdad, the 
<br>Ambassador emphasized. Second, Baghdad will be divided into 
<br>nine districts overseen by two deputy commanders reporting 
<br>directly to a military commander with full authority 
<br>operating independently of political pressures. Finally, the 
<br>security plan will be accompanied by economic and services 
<br>plan. In order to secure Baghdad, the Ambassador said, the 
<br>Iraqi Army (IA) will bring three extra brigades to Baghdad, 
<br>two from northern Iraq and one from the South, working 
<br>alongside an extra US brigade. The coalition will support by 
<br>bringing more forces into Iraq and committing additional 
<br>forces to be brought in if needed. The details will be 
<br>worked out in the coming days. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) The VP responded that National Security Advisor 
<br>Muwafuq Rubai'e had already presented the plan to him. "I 
<br>gave him four pages of comments," the VP said, and also "sent 
<br>a copy to General Casey." He reiterated previous concerns 
<br>about Shia-Sunni balance within the ISF, especially at 
<br>checkpoints. The Deputy Commander in Karkh should be from 
<br>the Ministry of Defense, al-Hashemi stated, and the Deputy 
<br>Commander in Rasafa should be from Ministry of Interior. The 
<br>VP agreed that more forces, both Coalition and Iraqi, would 
<br>be needed to solve Baghdad's security crisis. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
<br>Cabinet Reshuffle: Minister of Defense Needs to Be Replaced 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) The Ambassador asked about the proposed cabinet 
<br>change, noting that the PM said Tawafuq wants to change three 
<br>ministries but has not provided any substitutions. The VP 
<br>scoffed, saying that the PM wants those changes, not Tawafuq. 
<br>The PM will not tell us who he wants changed, al-Hashemi 
<br>complained, and is choosing to form a committee to review the 
<br>issue. One of the changes the PM wants to make, he 
<br>continued, is to move Tawafuq's Minister of State for Foreign 
<br>Affairs, Rafi'a al-Issawi, to Minister of Health (MoH). The 
<br>Ambassador noted that this is a great opportunity for 
<br>Tawafuq, since that ministry has been "destroyed" by its 
<br>current Sadrist Minister and al-Issawi will be "a hero" for 
<br>fixing it. The VP commented that there are "too many guns 
<br>and killers" at the MoH and that key people need to be 
<br>removed or else al-Issawi "will be killed" by the Jaysh 
<br>al-Mahdi (JAM) and Moqtada al-Sadr supporters working there. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) The VP noted that before Tawafuq agrees to any 
<br>ministerial changes, Minister of Defense Abdul Qadir 
<br>al-Mufriji must be replaced. Tawafuq has sent a clear 
<br>
<br>BAGHDAD 00000063 002 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>message to al-Mufirji, al-Hashemi said, that he should 
<br>resign. "We were forced by the Shia coalition" to place an 
<br>independent Sunni in this position, the VP lamented. 
<br>However, al-Hashemi said, the PM is the boss, the 
<br>Commander-in-Chief, and he is not independent. The Minister 
<br>of Defense makes sectarian issues worse by "simply 
<br>implementing the PM's ideas," al-Hashemi stressed. His 
<br>replacement, therefore, should come from Tawafuq. The 
<br>Ambassador noted that the PM has not decided the extent of 
<br>his cabinet change and that the Minister of Defense might not 
<br>be replaced. Besides, the Ambassador noted, our military 
<br>colleagues say al-Mufriji has a good reputation as an honest 
<br>and non-sectarian minister. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
<br>Saddam's Execution: Reconciliation "Dead" VP Warns 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S) Turning to Saddam's execution, the VP stated that 
<br>nobody had consulted with President Talabani, although he 
<br>noted that he had sent Rubaie a letter prior to the 
<br>execution. Al-Hashemi commented that Talabani believed his 
<br>signature was not required because of a legal statute which 
<br>states high tribunal sentences cannot be changed. The 
<br>Ambassador noted he had been told the same thing, and that he 
<br>had recommended that the PM press the Chief Justice for a 
<br>written opinion concurring with this assessment. Al-Hashemi 
<br>said he had also suggested that a judge put in writing his 
<br>opinion that a Presidential decree was unnecessary. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) The Ambassador then asked the VP whether the PM or his 
<br>advisors had approached him before the execution. The VP 
<br>said that he had not been consulted, although prior to the 
<br>execution he sent a letter to both the PM and Rubai'e sharing 
<br>concerns raised by Salah ad Din (SaD) officials during a 
<br>December 28 meeting (Ref A). The letter, the VP continued, 
<br>requested three days notice to address security issues in 
<br>SaD, Saddam's home province, and recommended that the GOI 
<br>release Saddam's remains to the SaD Governor for burial. 
<br>According to the VP, Rubai'e responded that it would not be 
<br>possible to provide three days notice since the PM is keeping 
<br>all details "a secret until the last minute." Rubai'e 
<br>further stated, al-Hashemi said, that he would try to give 
<br>notice at least one hour before the event. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (S) In addition to the legal issues and returning Saddam's 
<br>remains to SaD, the VP said he also spoke to the PM about 
<br>rushing through the execution during Eid. According to 
<br>al-Hashemi, the PM responded that it was "your Eid, not 
<br>mine," and noted that the religious leaders had confirmed 
<br>that if Saddam was executed before sunrise it would not occur 
<br>during Eid. (Note: Saddam was executed approximately one 
<br>hour before sunrise on December 30, the day which Sunni 
<br>Muslims began celebrating Eid al-Adha. End Note). The VP 
<br>noted that Saddam was executed "as a Sunni, not as a 
<br>dictator," and called the execution "the revenge of the Dawa 
<br>party." He further commented that reconciliation "was dead" 
<br>because of how the execution occurred. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (S) The Ambassador agreed that many people are upset with 
<br>how the execution occurred. When asked why the USG had 
<br>released Saddam Hussein when the GOI had not resolved some of 
<br>these issues, the Ambassador responded that Iraq had legal 
<br>custody of Saddam, although at GOI's request we had physical 
<br>custody. "We voiced our concerns," the Ambassador said, but 
<br>in the end the PM made the final decision. Based on Saddam's 
<br>execution, the VP suggested that MNF-I encourage the PM to 
<br>postpone the remaining two executions until reconciliation 
<br>has concluded. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---------------- 
<br>Moderate Front: IIP Relents on Conditions; Dawa will not join 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---------------- 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) The Ambassador noted that efforts to form a moderate 
<br>front have stalled and asked the VP where IIP stands on their 
<br>list of demands which must be met before joining the 
<br>coalition. The VP replied that while visiting Sulaymaniyah 
<br>with President Talabani, IIP agreed to change their 
<br>conditions (Ref B) to an agenda the moderate front would 
<br>address. In fact, al-Hashemi said, IIP had issued an amended 
<br>statement to this effect and had passed it to Rowsch Shaways 
<br>(former Iraqi Vice President and Deputy Prime Minister ) 
<br>Kurd ) KDP) and current Vice President Adil Abdul Mehdi 
<br>(SCIRI). They took the amended statement to the PM, 
<br>al-Hashemi said. The problem, the VP continued, is that the 
<br>PM has been unable to convince Dawa to join the coalition. 
<br>According to the VP, the PM has said that as a political 
<br>party leader he cannot join the coalition, but as the PM he 
<br>could form a group with the Presidency Council (the President 
<br>
<br>BAGHDAD 00000063 003 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>and two VPs) and the Council of Representatives (CoR) 
<br>speaker, Mahmoud Mashadani. The Ambassador responded that it 
<br>would be better if the coalition formed around political bloc 
<br>leaders. There could be constitutional concerns if a new 
<br>alliance between official positions forms, the Ambassador 
<br>cautioned. The VP said that once Abdul Mehdi returns to 
<br>Baghdad he is willing to discuss the issue again. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
<br>On Iranian Influence in the GOI: VP suggests new elections 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
<br>
<br>¶11. (S) On the Iranian detainees, the Ambassador commented 
<br>that President Talabani called these people his "guests," but 
<br>he did not even know who they are, the Ambassador said. The 
<br>VP responded that Iran's activities within Iraq and their 
<br>connections to GOI officials have not been a secret. "I have 
<br>been warning about Iran's influence for some time," he said. 
<br>The VP offered his appreciation for General Caldwell's 
<br>presentation (Ref C), but noted the General only shared 
<br>"things I already knew." The Ambassador asked the VP what 
<br>should be done with GOI leaders who are working with Quds 
<br>Force operatives. The VP replied that the GOI needs "to 
<br>start from scratch," with new elections and needs to 
<br>strengthen a weak central government. While affirming his 
<br>commitment to democracy and rule of law, the VP noted that 
<br>there are "problems" with some of the political partners. 
<br>The VP further commented that Iran's reach extends beyond 
<br>SCIRI, Badr and the Sadrists. He explained his belief that 
<br>CoR Speaker Mahmoud Mashadani (Tawafuq) is also influenced by 
<br>the Iranians and noted that several Sunni insurgent and 
<br>resistance groups have received Iranian support. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (S) Al-Hashemi asked the Ambassador about the GOI's 
<br>actions once MNF-I released the detainees. The Ambassador 
<br>commented that while he shares concerns about Iranian 
<br>influence, the GOI took some positive steps during this 
<br>incident. First, he said, once MNF-I released the detainees, 
<br>the GOI ordered them to leave Iraq and escorted them to the 
<br>Iranian border. Second, the MFA issued a statement 
<br>announcing their departure and stated publicly that "their 
<br>activities had been inconsistent with their diplomatic 
<br>status." Third, the GOI has requested an updated list of 
<br>Iranian diplomats in Iraq so that in the future it will be 
<br>easier to verify diplomatic status. Finally, the GOI is 
<br>sending a delegation to Iran, most likely led by Deputy Prime 
<br>Minister Barham Salih, to discuss the incident and its 
<br>implications. The Ambassador asked why the VP and IIP have 
<br>not made a bigger deal about the issue. The VP responded 
<br>that IIP is more concerned about reconciliation and that he 
<br>fears making a big deal about the Iranians and their ties 
<br>with other GOI leaders will hinder the reconciliation effort.
