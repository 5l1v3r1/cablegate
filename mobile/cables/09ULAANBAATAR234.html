<br>Classified By: Political Counselor Andrew K. Covington, Reasons 1.4 (b)
<br>and (d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) Summary: xxxxx. MFAT xxxxx led the Mongolian side, and the North
<br>Koreans met with President Elbegdorj on the sidelines of the
<br>consultation. xxxxx
<br>little on the bilateral relationship with Mongolia. Key
<br>themes on the part of the DPRK were the lack of criticism of
<br>the United States, indications that the DPRK is seeking
<br>bilateral talks with the USG on normalization of relations,
<br>that the recent travel of former President Clinton to
<br>Pyongyang has greatly improved the prospects for such talks,
<br>that Mongolia would be an appropriate venue for these talks,
<br>and that the Six Party Talks are no longer an option. End
<br>Summary.
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) xxxxx discuss Mongolia's annual bilateral
<br>consultations with the DPRK. xxxxx was present at the
<br>consultations and has been involved with Korean affairs as a
<br>diplomat since 1985. xxxxx was candid in his meetings with
<br>poloff, referring repeatedly and xxxxx the DPRK consultations.
<br>
<br>-------------------------------------------
<br>dprk delegation offers no criticism of u.s.
<br>-------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) xxxxx indicated that VFM Kim met with MFAT State
<br>Secretary Tsogtbaatar for the consultations and also held a
<br>separate meeting with President Elbegdorj on the margins
<br>Monday. The Mongolian Deputy Foreign Minister was to lead
<br>this latter meeting but was unable due to an obligation.
<br>xxxxx said the meetings were notable for several reasons:
<br>the DPRK delegation did not read from a prepared script, they
<br>were not aggressive and made no criticism of the United
<br>States, and they criticized China and Russia "three or four
<br>times" for supporting recent UN Resolutions aimed at the
<br>DPRK. What follows in paras 4 through 12 xxxxx
<br>description to poloff of the DPRK's statements during the
<br>course of the consultations:
<br>
<br>----------------------------
<br>dprk vfm on denuclearization
<br>----------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (S)xxxxx 
<br>said the DPRK is not a threat and was only interested in
<br>self-protection. The Mongolian side expressed concern that a
<br>nuclear DPRK could lead to a nuclear ROK, Japan, Syria, and
<br>Iran, and urged that the Mongolian nuclear-free model could
<br>serve as an example. xxxxx stated the United States would not
<br>allow Japan or the ROK to go nuclear and that the DPRK is
<br>committed to peace and denuclearization.
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) The Mongolians offered the example of the Soviet Union
<br>and the United States during the Reagan-Gorbachev era, when
<br>the two allowed for nuclear inspections, leading to improved
<br>trust and a reduction in the number of warheads. The
<br>Mongolians stated that if they were in the DPRK's place now,
<br>they would allow inspections, which would lead to mutual
<br>confidence and improved relations. The DPRK side offered no
<br>reaction to the suggestion.
<br>
<br>¶6. (S) The DPRK side said what is most important is for the
<br>United States and the DPRK to come up with a "common
<br>language," a "non-aggression agreement," and establishment of
<br>diplomatic relations. xxxxx stated if the sides can take such
<br>measures, then denuclearization will be possible and easy,
<br>and that relations with Japan and the ROK will normalize
<br>thereafter.
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) The Mongolian side counseled that recent
<br>"provocations"xxxxx; another word
<br>may have been used in the consultations) such as the missile
<br>test meant that the present situation was very fragile, and
<br>that the DPRK should be careful not to present the wrong
<br>signal. xxxxx The Mongolians stated that even if one has
<br>peaceful intentions, one can be seen as provocative.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------
<br>on bilateral talks with the u.s.
<br>--------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (S) Regarding former President Clinton's recent travel to
<br>the DPRK to secure of the release of the two journalists, Kim
<br>said this action had been prepared for a long time, meaning
<br>the groundwork for such a visit was already in place because
<br>of the progress the United States and the DPRK made during
<br>the Clinton presidency. Kim said forward motion stopped
<br>during the Bush Administration but was now able to proceed
<br>because of President Clinton's recent involvement in a
<br>personal capacity, because President Obama is of the same
<br>party, and because former First Lady Clinton is now the
<br>Secretary of State. The North Koreans were expecting a
<br>dialogue with the United States to start soon as an extension
<br>of President Clinton's visit.
<br>
<br>¶9. (S) Kim asked the Mongolians to support a U.S.-DPRK
<br>dialogue xxxxx stated "there are no eternal enemies in this
<br>world."
<br>
<br>----------------------
<br>on the six party talks
<br>----------------------
<br>
<br>¶10. (S) Kim took a "very hard line" on the Six Party Talks
<br>according to xxxxx stating that the DPRK will never return
<br>to the talks, that the talks were dead, but that the door has
<br>not closed on an opportunity for negotiations. During
<br>discussion of the Six Party Talks, Kim criticized Russia and
<br>China for their support of recent UN resolutions aimed at the
<br>DPRK. Kim said Japan and the ROK were natural allies of the
<br>United States during the talks, and that Russia and China
<br>ended up supporting the other three, so that the DPRK felt it
<br>was five against one. Kim stated the real intention of the
<br>Six Party Talks was to destroy the DPRK regime, and that at
<br>present the DPRK wants to talk only to the United States.
<br>
<br>------------------------------------------
<br>vfm kim's meeting with president elbegdorj
<br>------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶11. (S) xxxxx provided insight into Kim's meeting with
<br>Elbegdorj on August 10: Kim refrained from criticizing the
<br>United States and stated the DPRK would be happy if the GOM
<br>could support a U.S.-DPRK dialogue "in the international
<br>arena." Kim said to Elbegdorj, "We are telling you all this
<br>because Mongolia understand us." Kim reiterated the notion
<br>that there is a "good personal understanding" between former
<br>President Clinton and DPRK leader Kim Jong-Il.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------
<br>how about u.s.-dprk talks in mongolia?
<br>--------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶12. (S) xxxxx further noted that a xxxxx in Ulaanbaatar xxxxx on the way to the
<br>airport on August 11 that he had suggested to VFM Kim that it
<br>would be good to host U.S.-DPRK talks in Mongolia, but that
<br>Kim offered no reaction.xxxxx that the
<br>timing was right to establish a regional security mechanism
<br>whose organization the Mongols should spearhead.
