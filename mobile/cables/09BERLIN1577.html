<br>SUBJECT: NOW FOR THE HARD PART: MERKEL,S TEAM EXAMINES NEXT 
<br>STEPS IN IRAN 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Philip D. Murphy for reasons 1.4 b/d. 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (C) SUMMARY.  Chancellor Merkel set the German agenda on 
<br>Iran with her early November statement before the U.S. 
<br>Congress on "zero tolerance" for a nuclear armed Iran and the 
<br>need for tougher sanctions should engagement not work. 
<br>During a private roundtable hosted by Ambassador Murphy, 
<br>however, members of Germany's Iran "brain-trust" from the 
<br>German Parliament, MFA, Ministry of Economics and top 
<br>government funded think tank welcomed the President's 
<br>engagement policy, recommended broadening the dialogue to 
<br>areas of cooperation (drugs, Afghanistan, diplomatic 
<br>relations), betrayed little beyond a superficial knowledge of 
<br>the nuclear program, argued that Germany took the largest 
<br>economic hit from recent sanctions, and expressed doubts as 
<br>to the efficacy of sanctions, giving us a window into the 
<br>difficult task Chancellor Merkel will have in keeping her 
<br>government on her page.  In the end, we assess that Merkel 
<br>will have her way. END SUMMARY. 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (C) The November 24 event at the Embassy included members 
<br>of Parliament from the four main German political parties: 
<br>FDP Elke Hoff, CDU Andreas Schockenhoff, Greens Kerstin 
<br>Mueller, and SPD Rolf Muetzenich.  From the MFA, Policy 
<br>Planner Markus Ederer, DG for Economics Ruediger von Fritsch, 
<br>DG for Disarmament and Nonproliferation Amb. Peter Gottwald, 
<br>and Iran Task Force Director Andreas Krueger attended. 
<br>Ministry of Economics DG for External Economic Policy 
<br>Karl-Ernst Brauner and the Director of the German government 
<br>funded research institute Stiftung fuer Wissenschaft und 
<br>Politik (SWP, or Institute for Science and Politics) Volker 
<br>Perthes also attended. 
<br> 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br>MFA: TRR Not Dead Yet; But Not Well Either 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C) The Ambassador opened the discussion by thanking the 
<br>German government for its excellent cooperation on Iran and 
<br>asked his guests to share their thoughts on the Iranian 
<br>internal situation, especially given recent reports of the 
<br>expanded role of the IRGC in the cultural/educational spheres 
<br>of life, and how that might affect Iran's external policy. 
<br>MFA DG for Disarmament Gottwald stated that if we were 
<br>correct in assessing the Iranian regime's primary goal to be 
<br>survival, then we still had a chance with a negotiated 
<br>solution.  He said that while the Tehran Research Reactor 
<br>(TRR) deal was not "well," Germany wasn't ready to pronounce 
<br>it "dead" quite yet.  He concluded with a strong statement 
<br>saying that a nuclear armed Iran would be a nightmare in and 
<br>of itself and a disastrous blow to the NPT regime which was 
<br>why Germany would be a strong partner in support of further 
<br>sanctions. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (C) MFA Policy Planer Ederer said he thought Iran was 
<br>confused about what it wants and that the West might be even 
<br>more confused about how to get what we want.  He said we want 
<br>Iranian behavior change, but we don't agree yet what will get 
<br>us there.  He said UN sponsored sanctions would isolate Iran 
<br>and limit its capacity, but questioned whether they would 
<br>change Tehran's behavior.  He said he realized sanctions 
<br>remained a good alternative to military action, but 
<br>questioned whether they were really capable of anything other 
<br>than just buying time. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br>More Carrots before we Reach for the Sticks 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (C) SWP's Perthes argued Iranian Supreme Leader 
<br>Khamenei's primary interest was to maintain the security of 
<br>the system and prevent regime change.  Perthes said Khamenei 
<br>feared a velvet revolution over all else, though regional 
<br>instability was a close second.  He noted Iran remained 
<br>besieged by problems of drug smuggling, piracy, and 
<br>instability in Pakistan.  He recommended more emphasis be 
<br>placed on trying to find an incentive for the regime to 
<br>cooperate on the regional track, which had already shown some 
<br>progress.  He said the April 2009, 300 million dollar Iranian 
<br>pledge at the Pakistan donor's conference was an important 
<br>symbol of the value the regime placed on regional security. 
<br>He suggested the West "broaden" relations with Iran to areas 
<br>where cooperation could be had: drugs, Afghanistan, and 
<br>diplomatic (especially Consular) ties.  POL M/C noted this 
<br>was fine, but ignored the fact that time was not on our side. 
<br> Rather, Iran was installing new centrifuges each week.  If 
<br>Iran wanted to build confidence or "broaden" relations, it 
<br>could modulate that pace, but time was not a luxury we had. 
<br>Gottwald agreed emphatically. 
<br> 
<br>BERLIN 00001577  002 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (C) Changing course, Perthes said that if "sticks" had to 
<br>be used, he suggested more focus on "export-control" and less 
<br>on sanctions. He noted evidence suggested export control 
<br>regimes had already worked in slowing down centrifuge 
<br>progress.  He concluded by saying that if sanctions must be 
<br>used, we should avoid all use of the word "crippling" and 
<br>instead focus on "targeted" sanctions in order not to turn 
<br>the Iranian masses against us and right back into 
<br>Ahmadinejad's hands.  He also suggested that "unofficial" 
<br>sanctions such as Russia's decision not to sell the S300s 
<br>were more effective than most formal sanctions.  If formal 
<br>sanctions had to be pursued he said only global sanctions 
<br>would be effective, and therefore advocated UNSC action. 
<br>Perthes said he saw readiness in the German business 
<br>community to accept financial loss if sanctions were truly 
<br>global, but they don't want to see business opportunities 
<br>being lost to China or India. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br>Green Party : Too Late to Prevent, Need To Contain 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (C) From the opposition, Green Party Foreign Policy 
<br>Spokesperson Kerstin Mueller said she was glad that the new 
<br>U.S. administration no longer talked about a threat of a 
<br>military option.  But she also said she was skeptical that 
<br>Iran can be prevented from obtaining a nuclear capability 
<br>without a military option, and that it might even be too late 
<br>for a military option to be effective.  She said she didn't 
<br>see compromise within the interests of the regime and thought 
<br>the West should focus more attention on how to "control" a 
<br>nuclear-armed Iran. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------------------- 
<br>FDP: Rank and File Grudging Partner on Iran? 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (C) FDP Spokeswoman on Defense Policy, Elke Hoff opened 
<br>her remarks with a grudging acknowledgment of the coalition 
<br>agreement in which her party agreed that if engagement with 
<br>Iran on the nuclear dossier failed, sanctions would be 
<br>implemented.  She added that she remained personally 
<br>skeptical as to their efficacy.  She said additional 
<br>sanctions would serve the unintended consequence of rallying 
<br>the masses around Ahmadinejad. 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (C) Hoff said she often hears from constituents in the 
<br>business community that German companies are getting 
<br>pressured from their American counterparts not to do business 
<br>in Iran, and yet they see plenty of U.S. products for sale in 
<br>Iran. Econ M/C intervened and stressed that the U.S. was 
<br>ready to prosecute any U.S. businesses in violation of U.S. 
<br>sanctions and had already done so.  Hoff also suggested 
<br>offering German businesses financial compensation should new 
<br>sanctions come into play.  In response to a criticism from 
<br>Hoff on whether the U.S. deadline created for engagement on 
<br>Iran reflected Obama's domestic political agenda, the 
<br>Ambassador emphasized the deep commitment of the 
<br>administration to engagement. 
<br> 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>Germany is the Largest Loser 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (C) MFA DG for Economics Von Fritsch agreed with 
<br>Perthes' suggestion to focus more on the carrots and not the 
<br>sticks.  He noted that no single country has (recently) 
<br>sacrificed as much financially as Germany has, not just in 
<br>existing trade, but also in long term future contracts.  Econ 
<br>M/C noted that U.S. business had also suffered enormous trade 
<br>and investment losses after 1979.  Von Fritsch said if 
<br>sanctions were inevitable, German business preferred global 
<br>and clear sanctions as opposed to vague wording that can be 
<br>left open to differing interpretations.  On correspondent 
<br>banking relations, Von Fritsch said the German government was 
<br>still examining the issue but that a complete severance of 
<br>correspondent banking relations including with Iran's central 
<br>bank would not be possible since it would amount to a total 
<br>trade embargo. 
<br> 
<br>¶11.  (C) Ministry of Economics DG for External Policy Brauner 
<br>referenced the inclusion in German law of the presumptive 
<br>right to trade, and said that he was concerned that what the 
<br>German Customs and BAFA (export control agency under the 
<br>Ministry of Economics) were doing to encourage "Nullbescheid" 
<br>(pre-certification that specific trade with Iran is not 
<br>illicit) might actually be illegal, as German business had 
<br>complained.  He said one important consideration for Germany 
<br> 
<br>BERLIN 00001577  003 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>was that a further crackdown on trade with Iran could 
<br>endanger repayment of the 4.5 billion Euros in outstanding 
<br>credits that Iran owed Germany. Germany had agreed not to 
<br>issue any new credit under its Hermes (OPIC-like) program, 
<br>but expected to be able to collect on outstanding credits. 
<br>Nonetheless, both Brauner and Von Fritsch emphasized that in 
<br>the event of no progress in negotiations with Iran, Germany 
<br>was ready to enter a new round of stronger sanctions, and 
<br>that we should look to Chancellor Merkel's statements in the 
<br>U.S. Congress and FM Westerwelle's reiterations of her strong 
<br>policy as the final say on which direction Germany would go 
<br>on Iran. 
<br> 
<br>¶12.  (C) CONCLUSION.  The majority of the guests at the table 
<br>distinctly deferred to Perthes for guidance on where the Iran 
<br>issue might be headed or should be headed.  This was striking 
<br>amongst such a high ranking group of people operationally 
<br>involved with the Iran issue.  Also illuminating was the 
<br>variety of talking points employed by the participants to 
<br>define hurdles for sanction until debunked one at a time by 
<br>Embassy officers.  The candor with which even some MFA and 
<br>Ministry of Economics officials expressed their skepticism on 
<br>the efficacy of pursuing tougher sanctions on Iran may mean 
<br>that Merkel will have to press hard within her own government 
<br>to deliver on her promise of implementing tougher sanctions 
<br>should engagement with Iran fail.  None of our interlocutors, 
<br>however, questioned whether Merkel would, at the end of the 
<br>day, be able to "deliver" on her promises.  If and when we 
<br>decide to go forward on the pressure track on Iran, the USG 
<br>may wish to reinforce Merkel's position by showing 
<br>appreciation for Germany's strong continuing support.  END 
<br>CONCLUSION.
