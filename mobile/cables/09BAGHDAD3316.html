<br>
<br>Classified By: A/DCM Gary A. Grappo for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: In a wide-ranging discussion with visiting 
<br>NEA A/S Feltman on December 14, President Talabani 
<br>underscored the importance for Kurds of the POTUS/VPOTUS 
<br>telephone calls with Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) 
<br>President Barzani, the December 7 White House statement on 
<br>Iraq's election law and the message conveyed by Secretary 
<br>of Defense Gates. He predicted a tough government 
<br>coalition process in Iraq after the March elections, 
<br>dismissed the significance of the Kurdish Goran ("Change") 
<br>Movement and said the PUK and KDP - which will again run on 
<br>a united Kurdish list - had agreed with PM Maliki's State 
<br>of Law coalition to try to form a front as part of a 
<br>government coalition after elections. On Iran ("a very 
<br>difficult country"), Talabani said the domestic political 
<br>situation is highly unstable and the regime's leadership 
<br>paralyzed: Supreme Leader Khamenei fears further alienating 
<br>the Iranian street, but is hemmed in by regime hardliners 
<br>and cannot afford to appease the opposition, either. Iran's 
<br>multi-ethnic population and the Islamic Revolutionary 
<br>Guard Corps' (IRGC) efforts to expand its writ posed 
<br>additional challenges for the regime. While Syria and Iran 
<br>agreed on much, Syria's attempts to resuscitate Iraq's 
<br>Ba'th Party (a mistake, in Talabani's view) worried 
<br>Tehran. Talabani said Saudi Arabia's effort to re-tether 
<br>Syria to the broader Arab community had prompted closer 
<br>Egyptian-Iraqi ties. The Saudi effort to isolate Iraq from 
<br>its regional neighbors was "misguided", but given the 
<br>personal enmity between King Abdullah and PM Maliki, 
<br>Saudi-Iraqi rapprochement was unlikely if Maliki won 
<br>another term as PM. Talabani said Iraq's second oil bid 
<br>round helped allay concerns about Iraq's credit worthiness, 
<br>highlighted its potential to become a wealthy country and 
<br>gave Iraq a chance to rival Saudi Arabia's oil production 
<br>in 10-15 years. End summary. 
<br>
<br>ELECTION LAW AND SECRETARY OF DEFENSE GATES' VISIT 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Talabani said KRG President Masoud Barzani was "very 
<br>pleased and satisfied" with the recent visit of Secretary 
<br>of Defense Gates (ref A) and his reiteration of the 
<br>December 7 White House statement on the U.S. commitment to 
<br>Iraq's constitution (including Article 140), support for a 
<br>census and pledge to help resolve outstanding Arab-Kurd 
<br>issues. Talabani said that while some actors in the Iraqi 
<br>Kurdistan Region (IKR) claimed the Kurds were "deceived" 
<br>into settling for 43 parliamentary seats as part of the 
<br>recently-completed election law deal (ref B), he and 
<br>Barzani believed long-term relations with the U.S., as 
<br>manifested in the White House statement and the SecDef's 
<br>message, were more important than an additional 2-3 
<br>parliamentary seats. A/S Feltman underscored the U.S. 
<br>commitment to resolve outstanding Arab-Kurd issues in 
<br>accordance with Iraq's constitution and Article 140. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Talabani noted that "some Kurds" failed to 
<br>understand that Article 142 stipulates that any proposed 
<br>changes to the constitution cannot impinge on rights 
<br>otherwise guaranteed to the provinces. (Comment: Mentioned 
<br>in the White House statement of December 7, Article 142 
<br>provides a mechanism for amending the constitution. In 
<br>Qprovides a mechanism for amending the constitution. In 
<br>mentioning it, Talabani likely intended to caution that any 
<br>attempt to amend the constitution in a way that limited 
<br>Kurds' rights to resolve DIBs issues under Article 140 
<br>would be unacceptable. End comment.) While the Bush 
<br>administration had been "very friendly" toward the Kurds, 
<br>it had never publicly expressed support for Kurdish 
<br>interests, Talabani said. (Note: He claimed former VP 
<br>Cheney committed to doing so after Iraq adopted 
<br>hydrocarbons legislation, which has still not occurred. 
<br>End note). Kurds were "very glad" about the 
<br>POTUS/VPOTUS-Barzani calls and December 7 White House 
<br>statement, which represented a commitment by the U.S. to 
<br>them. (Note: As reported ref C, Kurdish, Arab and Turkoman 
<br>interlocutors have publicly and privately expressed the 
<br>fears that the POTUS/VPOTUS calls, together with the 
<br>December 7 statement, represent a deal by which the KRG 
<br>agreed to accept a consensus election law agreement in 
<br>exchange for U.S. support of a process that would lead to 
<br>the eventual annexation of Kirkuk into the IKR. End note.) 
<br>
<br>
<br>BAGHDAD 00003316 002 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>GOVERNMENT FORMATION - "THEN WE'LL HAVE PROBLEMS" 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) While the negotiating for a consensus agreement on 
<br>an election law compromise had been difficult, Talabani 
<br>claimed delaying the election until March would mitigate 
<br>weather-related complications during the polling. After 
<br>that would come the effort to form a coalition government. 
<br>"Then we will have problems", Talabani predicted. (Note: 
<br>Responding to Ambassador Hill's question about whether 
<br>Iraqi Kurdistan Parliament Speaker Dr. Kamal Kirkuki would 
<br>participate in the Kurdish Alliance List's negotiating 
<br>team, Talabani characterized Kirkuki as "a foolish man" and 
<br>joked that he was not really a doctor, not really named 
<br>Kamal and was not actually from Kirkuk, as his surname 
<br>suggested. End note.) Responding to A/S Feltman's question 
<br>about whether government formation negotiations would be 
<br>over the position of the president or the presidency 
<br>(encompassing the president and two vice-presidents), 
<br>Talabani said that in accordance with the Iraqi constitution, 
<br>they would only pertain to the office of the 
<br>president. Referring to VP al-Hashimi's unhelpful veto of 
<br>the November 8 election law, Talabani noted that the 
<br>current arrangement by which the president and two vice 
<br>presidents may veto legislation had benefits and drawbacks. 
<br>(Note: It is unclear whether parliament will approve 
<br>holding a constitutional referendum to extend the current 
<br>arrangement by which the president and two vice presidents 
<br>have a veto. End note.) 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Talabani said in recent negotiations the PUK and KDP 
<br>reached agreement with PM Maliki's Shi'a-led State of Law 
<br>Alliance (SLA) to form a front as part of a coalition 
<br>government after elections. The bloc with the largest 
<br>number of seats would nominate a candidate for PM. 
<br>(Comment: Consummation of the proposed deal will likely 
<br>depend on how many seats SLA is able to win. End comment.) 
<br>Talabani said the KDP and PUK will again run together on a 
<br>united Kurdish Alliance List (KAL). Nawshirwan Mustafa's 
<br>Goran (aka, "Change") Movement would run on a separate 
<br>list, as would the Kurdish Islamic Union and League of 
<br>Muslims of Kurdistan. 
<br>
<br>
<br>TALABANI DISMISSES GORAN MOVEMENT'S SIGNIFICANCE 
<br>--------------------------------------------- --- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Responding to A/S Feltman's question about what 
<br>Goran meant for Kurdish internal politics, Talabani 
<br>characterized the movement as an expression of 
<br>dissatisfaction with the status quo. Criticizing Goran's 
<br>"negative agenda", he claimed the movement lacked an 
<br>organized party structure, a program and leadership. 
<br>(Comment: As reported ref D, Goran largely agrees with the 
<br>PUK/KDP's "national" Kurdish agenda; however, unlike the 
<br>PUK/KDP, Goran believes implementation of Article 140 and 
<br>progress on resolving Kirkuk should be the first among 
<br>them. End comment.) Talabani complained that although 
<br>Goran members were part of a group of IKG parliamentarians 
<br>that participated in election law negotiations in Baghdad, 
<br>they later claimed they had been deceived into backing the 
<br>compromise agreement. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Sharply criticizing Goran, he claimed its members 
<br>were "politically immature" and did not understand politics 
<br>outside the IKR. Dismissing Goran's significance for 
<br>internal Kurdish politics, Talabani claimed "thousands" who 
<br>had supported the party in July's KRG parliamentary 
<br>elections had been disappointed by it and were now 
<br>Qelections had been disappointed by it and were now 
<br>leaving. Talabani claimed many of those were joining 
<br>Kurdish Islamic parties, whose ranks were swelling, to 
<br>register opposition to the existing PUK-KDP bipolar order. 
<br>
<br>IRAN: "NO SECURITY AND NO STABILITY" 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) A/S Feltman gave the U.S. assessment that the 
<br>Iranian regime's failure to respond positively to elements 
<br>of the October 1 proposal reflected divisions within the 
<br>regime's leadership and an inability to reach a decision on 
<br>its nuclear aspirations. Talabani cautioned against 
<br>ignoring "the real crisis" Iran's regime now faced. 
<br>Opposition born of the regime's heavy-handed response to 
<br>election protests had clearly demonstrated that the regime 
<br>lacked the support of a majority of Iranians. Supreme 
<br>Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei does not want to lose the 
<br>sympathy of the Iranian street, but "cannot afford to 
<br>appease it, either." Talabani expressed his view that 
<br>recent remarks by Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani decrying 
<br>
<br>BAGHDAD 00003316 003 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>"plots" against Iran's nuclear program also constrained 
<br>Khamenei's room for maneuver and threw into stark relief 
<br>the internal political crisis the regime faces. There is 
<br>"no security and no stability in Iran now", Talabani said. 
<br>
<br>MULTI-ETHNIC POPULATION CHALLENGES IRAN'S REGIME 
<br>--------------------------------------------- --- 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Compounding longstanding fissures in the political 
<br>landscape is Iran's multi-ethnic population, which had 
<br>become an increasingly prominent source of friction, 
<br>according to Talabani. Noting 14 Kurdish intellectuals 
<br>were recently sentenced to death for peacefully opposing 
<br>the Iranian regime, Talabani highlighted what he termed the 
<br>emerging "partisan war" between the regime and ethnic 
<br>Azeris. Talabani flatly said there had been "interference 
<br>in and falsification of" election results by the regime. 
<br>He agreed with A/S Feltman's assessment that it was 
<br>unlikely reformist Mir Hossein Mousavi had legitimately 
<br>lost in his predominantly Azeri home province. Stressing 
<br>the key role Mousavi played during his tenure as Iranian 
<br>Prime Minister in developing ethnically Azeri areas of 
<br>Iran, Talabani said he was genuinely popular and enjoyed 
<br>wide support. Describing the current struggle between 
<br>reformists and the regime, Talabani said Mousavi is "now 
<br>engaged in a fight from which he cannot retreat". 
<br>
<br>IRGC ANTAGONIZING IRANIAN ARMY AND BAZAARIS 
<br>------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) A/S Feltman observed that Iran,s Islamic 
<br>Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) was taking advantage of 
<br>political instability and the leadership's paralysis to 
<br>expand its writ. Talabani agreed, but noted that while the 
<br>IRGC's leadership is united at the senior levels, 
<br>divisions exist among the rank and file. The IRGC was not 
<br>popular, he said: Iranian Army leaders were unhappy that 
<br>the IRGC, a rival for resources and influence, was 
<br>expanding its domain and Iranian merchants were unhappy 
<br>about the IRGC's increasing involvement in economic 
<br>activities. A/S Feltman underscored potential short-term 
<br>dangers stemming from increased IRGC influence. An example 
<br>was the increased IRGC naval presence in the Persian Gulf, 
<br>where the U.S. and Iranian navies had longstanding 
<br>experience with each other's operations and established 
<br>bridge-to-bridge communication protocols to mitigate 
<br>potential miscommunication. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Agreeing that the IRGC was trying to extend its 
<br>influence, Talabani said the IRGC had to approve the 
<br>appointments of most Iranian ambassadors, including all 
<br>those appointed to "important states". He stressed the 
<br>importance of differentiating between "what they (IRGC 
<br>leaders) say and what is in their hearts". In their 
<br>hearts, IRGC leaders are afraid; however, they adopt a 
<br>maximalist public line in the belief it will help the 
<br>regime reach the best possible deal with the U.S. and 
<br>Europe on the nuclear program and other issues. Talabani 
<br>attributed significant changes in the IRGC's leadership 
<br>cadre to concerns about loyalty stemming from the 
<br>widely-repeated view that 70 percent of IRGC officers 
<br>voted for reformist former Iranian President Mohammad 
<br>Khatami in 1997, and presumably remain sympathetic to the 
<br>reform movement. 
<br>
<br>IRAN "A VERY DIFFICULT COUNTRY" 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Noting that the U.S. had pursued bilateral and 
<br>multilateral approaches, but had not been able to prompt 
<br>Iran's regime to respond, A/S Feltman asked Talabani what 
<br>QIran's regime to respond, A/S Feltman asked Talabani what 
<br>advice he might offer. After a long pause, Talabani sighed 
<br>and conceded that Iran is "a very difficult country". 
<br>While some Iranians claimed nuclear weapons were 
<br>un-Islamic, the regime was making "quick progress" towards 
<br>acquiring nuclear weapons capability. Talabani said he 
<br>believed there were more secret sites than the recently 
<br>disclosed one at Qom, and assessed that the Iranian regime 
<br>sought to approach turn-key status with respect to its ability 
<br>to initiate production of nuclear weapons. He noted the 
<br>potency 
<br>of the nuclear program as a "national issue" with which the 
<br>regime could rally the Iranian people and deflect attention 
<br>from shortcomings in domestic programs. Citing increased 
<br>Russian pressure on Iran, Talabani said he thought U.S. 
<br>policies had been "wise." He offered that it would be 
<br>helpful if China reached a similar decision with respect to 
<br>its willingness to further pressure Iran, and suggested 
<br>that increased Iraqi oil production could help mitigate 
<br>
<br>BAGHDAD 00003316 004 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>China's dependence on Iranian oil, potentially freeing 
<br>China to pursue a harder policy on Iran's nuclear program. 
<br>
<br>IRAN-IRAQ-SYRIA RELATIONS 
<br>------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) While Iranian leaders' views on individual Shi'a 
<br>Iraqi leaders were "not homogeneous" (some supported former 
<br>PM Jaafari, others supported PM Maliki), they are united in 
<br>their desire for a Shi'a-led government and fear of a 
<br>resurgent Ba'th Party. Talabani said a contact told him 
<br>during his last visit to Iran that Muhammad Nassif 
<br>Khayrbek, the former head of Syria's General Intelligence 
<br>Directorate and a senior advisor to President Bashar 
<br>al-Asad recently visited Tehran and proposed that Iran and 
<br>Syria cooperate to bring Iraq's Ba'th Party back to power 
<br>as "a bridge between Iran and Syria". (Note: Talabani flew 
<br>to Iran on/about November 22 to appeal for the lives of 
<br>Iranian Kurds sentenced to death. End note.) A/S Feltman 
<br>noted that while Iran and Syria agree on much, a major 
<br>point of divergence is Iraq. Talabani agreed, noting that 
<br>Syria heavily supported Iraqi Ba'thists, while Iran opposed 
<br>them. Syria is actively working to change Iranian leaders' 
<br>minds; however, Syria's support for the Iraqi National 
<br>Movement coalition that includes, among others, former PM 
<br>Ayad Allawi (secular Shi'a) and Saleh al-Mutlaq (Sunni with 
<br>Ba'thist ties) "worried Iran." 
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) Talabani said the Syrian regime approached him one 
<br>month ago through a friend to ask that he help mediate 
<br>between Syria and Iraq to reduce tensions stoked by PM 
<br>Maliki's accusation of Syrian complicity in recent bomb 
<br>attacks against GOI facilities in Baghdad. The emissary 
<br>said Talabani should contact President Bashar al-Asad 
<br>directly, and that Syria was willing to "cease all support 
<br>for action against Iraq" if an accommodation could be 
<br>reached. A/S Feltman noted that the U.S. was trying to 
<br>identify ways to improve relations with Syria. Talabani 
<br>stressed that if there were any improvement on the 
<br>Israeli-Palestinian track, better U.S.-Syria relations 
<br>could be possible. Recalling an exchange several years ago 
<br>with Bashar in which he asked what Syria wanted from the 
<br>U.S., Talabani said Bashar answered that he wanted the 
<br>Golan back and a stable Iraq that would not work against 
<br>Syria, in that order. Talabani said he asked Bashar if the 
<br>order could be reversed, pointing out that strong 
<br>Syria-Iraq ties could help Damascus with respect to Israel. 
<br>
<br>SYRIA ERRS IN TRYING TO RESTORE IRAQ'S BA'TH PARTY 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----- 
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) On Syria's support for those conducting attacks in 
<br>Iraq, Talabani said Syria made "a big mistake" in thinking 
<br>it could return the Ba'th Party to power in Iraq, which was 
<br>their ultimate goal. The nadir of Syrian-Iraqi relations 
<br>coincided with the period in which the Ba'th ruled Damascus 
<br>and Baghdad. Syrian leaders wanted to play the role of 
<br>"fraternal helpers" in restoring Iraqi Ba'thists to power. 
<br>Baghdad's offer to reopen pipelines, supply gas and open 
<br>points of entry on the Syria-Iraq border had been viewed 
<br>suspiciously by Damascus, which did not believe a 
<br>Maliki-led government would honor such commitments. 
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) A/S Feltman noted that in conversations with Syria, 
<br>the SARG always raised Iraq. The U.S. recently asked Syria 
<br>to stop broadcasts from Damascus of Ba'thist-backed 
<br>satellite channels glorifying terrorism and violence, but 
<br>had not seen any action. Talabani offered that Syria was 
<br>Qhad not seen any action. Talabani offered that Syria was 
<br>waiting for the results of Iraq's upcoming elections, in 
<br>which they hoped a strong Sunni bloc would emerge, before 
<br>making any decisions on its Iraq policy. Noting that the 
<br>SARG was good at collecting cards, A/S Feltman asked 
<br>Talabani when they might actually play their hand. 
<br>Talabani replied that while Hafez al-Asad had been an 
<br>excellent player, Bashar was still young. Referring to 
<br>Bashar's leadership style, he said Arabs jokingly described 
<br>Syria as a "Jamluka", a play on the Arabic words 
<br>"Jamahuriya" (Libya's "state of the masses") and "mamluka" 
<br>("monarchy"). 
<br>
<br>SAUDI-SYRIA THAW PROMPTS CLOSER EGYPTIAN-IRAQI TIES 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
<br>
<br>¶17. (C) A/S Feltman asked Talabani what the visit to 
<br>Damascus in October by Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah after a 
<br>five-year hiatus in Saudi-Syrian relations meant for Iraq. 
<br>Talabani laughingly said King Abdullah told him "You and 
<br>Iraq are in my hearts, but that man (Maliki) is not". 
<br>Citing Maliki's "failed promises" to Saudi leaders, 
<br>
<br>BAGHDAD 00003316 005 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>Talabani said Abdullah and the Saudis refused to deal with 
<br>the PM, despite U.S. attempts to mediate. Syria, too, 
<br>blamed Maliki for Iraq's anti-Syria policies and found it 
<br>difficult to work with him. According to Talabani, Syrian 
<br>officials told Maliki during the latter's most recent visit 
<br>to Damascus (shortly before the August 19 bombings in 
<br>Baghdad) that they were supporting Iraq's Ba'th Party, 
<br>further stoking Maliki's fear of Ba'thist conspiracies 
<br>against him. 
<br>
<br>¶18. (C) Talabani said King Abdullah is trying to re-tether 
<br>Syria to the broader Arab community, an initiative Egypt 
<br>opposes. Partly as a consequence, Egyptian-Iraqi relations 
<br>had improved. Riyadh tried to pressure Cairo not to 
<br>facilitate Maliki's recent visit to Egypt, but the visit 
<br>had come off. A/S Feltman offered that King Abdullah's 
<br>visit to Damascus and the possibility of warming ties 
<br>between Saudi Arabia and Syria was likely a factor in 
<br>encouraging Egyptian ties with Iraq, to help counterbalance 
<br>the Saudi effort. Noting 
<br>Riyadh's important regional role, Talabani said Saudi 
<br>Arabia was actively working to prevent Iraq from developing 
<br>relationships with its regional neighbors, and claimed it 
<br>had pressured Kuwait to backtrack on initial agreements 
<br>with Iraq on issues dating to the Saddam-era. Despite 
<br>Saudi opposition, though, Qatar and Bahrain were seeking 
<br>improved relations with Iraq. 
<br>
<br>SAUDI-IRAQI RAPPROCHEMENT UNLIKELY IF MALIKI PM AGAIN 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------- 
<br>
<br>19.(C) Talabani characterized the Saudi policy as 
<br>misguided, noting that Iraq could play a positive role in 
<br>attenuating tension between the Saudi government and its 
<br>largely Shi'a opposition. A/S Feltman said the U.S. would 
<br>encourage the Saudis to revisit their Iraq policy after 
<br>upcoming 
<br>Iraqi elections in March. Talabani offered that if Maliki 
<br>remained PM, things would likely remain as is since the 
<br>enmity was personal; however, with a different PM - even 
<br>another Shi'ite like ISCI's Ammar al-Hakim or Allawi - 
<br>there was a chance for positive change. He cautioned that 
<br>such an effort could be hurt if the Saudis' efforts to 
<br>support the emergence of a strong Sunni bloc in the Iraqi 
<br>parliament failed, which he thought likely. 
<br>
<br>¶20. (C) Talabani assessed Turkey's role with respect to 
<br>Iraq as generally good and said his relations with Turkey 
<br>were "excellent". Noting improved relations between Ankara 
<br>and the KRG, he pointed to Turkish FM Gul's recent visit to 
<br>Erbil. Turkey could play a positive role in the region and 
<br>Ankara's policy towards Kurds (Iraq) and Alawites (Syria) 
<br>was generally positive, despite opposition from the Turkish 
<br>General Staff and some quarters of Turkey's parliament. He 
<br>offered that Turkey could play a positive role with respect 
<br>to Syria. 
<br>
<br>SECOND OIL BID ROUND 
<br>-------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶21. (C) Talabani expressed surprise that companies from the 
<br>U.S., which "liberated Iraq and therefore earned the 
<br>right", had not won more contracts during Iraq's 
<br>recently-concluded Second Petroleum Licensing Round ("bid 
<br>round"), held December 11-12 in Baghdad. (Note: As reported 
<br>ref E, only three of the seven pre-qualified U.S. companies 
<br>attended the bid round and only one (Occidental Petroleum) 
<br>submitted a bid. No U.S. companies were awarded contracts 
<br>during the second bid round; however, ExxonMobil and 
<br>Occidental won contracts in the first round potentially
