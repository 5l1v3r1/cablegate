<br> 
<br>Classified By: DCM Luis G. Moreno, reasons 1.4 (b),(d) 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (S) Summary:  Assistant Secretary for Political-Military 
<br>Affairs Andrew Shapiro met with a number of GOI officials on 
<br>July 22-23 to stress the importance of the U.S.-Israeli 
<br>political-military relationship, and to discuss among other 
<br>issues Israel's Qualitative Military Edge (QME).  GOI 
<br>interlocutors continued to press for the opportunity to 
<br>review the QME report prior to its submission to Congress, 
<br>and presented an official response to a U.S. non-paper on 
<br>potential arms transfers to Arab countries.  In that respect, 
<br>the MOD proposed technical discussions in Washington on 
<br>August 3 to further discuss GOI concerns over the potential 
<br>F-15SA transfer to Saudi Arabia.  GOI officials continued to 
<br>express reservations regarding U.S. arms transfers to 
<br>Lebanon, and requested the opportunity to further discuss 
<br>U.S. strategy and intentions with respect to the Lebanese 
<br>Armed Forces.  GOI interlocutors raised continued concerns 
<br>over the Iranian nuclear weapons program, noting that any 
<br>policy of engagement be done in conjunction with tougher 
<br>sanctions and for a finite period of time before turning to 
<br>other "options on the table."  Other issues raised by GOI 
<br>officials included the Peace Process, Israel's export control 
<br>system, and potential Israeli exports to China.  Both sides 
<br>agreed in principle to the next session of the Joint 
<br>Political Military Group (JPMG) in October or early November 
<br>in Israel. End summary. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (SBU)  On July 22, A/S Shapiro met with MOD Director 
<br>General Pinchas Buchris, MOD Political-Military Director Amos 
<br>Gilad, Defense Export Control Directorate Chief Eli Pincu, 
<br>and participated in a roundtable discussion led by J5 
<br>Strategic Division Chief Brigadier General Yossi Heymann.  At 
<br>the MFA on July 23, A/S Shapiro met with Director General 
<br>Yossi Gal and participated in a roundtable discussion led by 
<br>Deputy Director General for Strategic Affairs Alon Bar and 
<br>Export Control Director Roey Gilad.  A/S Shapiro also 
<br>participated in a strategic tour of Israel, and visited 
<br>Israeli defense company Plasan-Sasa. 
<br> 
<br>U.S.-Israeli Relationship 
<br>------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (SBU) A/S Shapiro stressed the importance of the 
<br>U.S-Israeli political-military relationship, noting the 
<br>significance of visiting Israel on his first overseas trip in 
<br>his capacity as Assistant Secretary for the 
<br>Political-Military Affairs Bureau.  GOI interlocutors 
<br>appreciated the opportunity to resume dialogue on this 
<br>important aspect of the U.S.-Israeli relationship.  MOD DG 
<br>Buchris noted the two still relatively new administrations in 
<br>the United States and Israel, and the importance of limiting 
<br>the number of misunderstandings in the future. 
<br> 
<br>Qualitative Military Edge 
<br>------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (S) GOI officials reiterated the importance of maintaining 
<br>Israel's Qualitative Military Edge (QME).  They said that 
<br>Israel understands U.S. policy intentions to arm moderate 
<br>Arab states in the region to counter the Iranian threat, and 
<br>prefers such sales originate from the United States instead 
<br>of other countries like Russia or China.  However, Israel 
<br>continues to stress the importance of identifying potential 
<br>risks that may become future threats or adversaries, and for 
<br>this reason maintains several objections as indicated in the 
<br>official GOI response to the QME non-paper on potential U.S. 
<br>arms sales to the region (ref e-mail to PM/RSAT separately). 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (S) GOI officials also expressed continued interest in 
<br>reviewing the QME report prior to its submission to Congress. 
<br> A/S Shapiro reiterated that the report was based on an 
<br>assessment from the intelligence community, and therefore not 
<br>releasable to the GOI.  He referenced previous points made to 
<br>the Israeli embassy in Washington regarding the report, and 
<br>welcomed any comments the GOI might have -- although such 
<br>comments should be delivered as soon as possible as the 
<br>report is already overdue.  Israeli interlocutors appreciated 
<br>the classified nature of the report, but also made clear it 
<br>was difficult to comment on the report's results without 
<br>reviewing its content or intelligence assessment.  In that 
<br>respect, Buchris and other GOI officials requested that the 
<br>QME process be reviewed in light of future QME reports. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (S) GOI interlocutors attempted to make the argument that 
<br>moderate Arab countries could in the future become 
<br>adversaries -- and that this should be taken into account in 
<br>the QME process.  During a roundtable discussion led by the 
<br>MFA's Deputy Director General for Strategic Affairs Alon Bar, 
<br>the MFA's Center for Policy Research gave intelligence briefs 
<br>on Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Lebanon to further support the 
<br>argument that these countries could become future foes. 
<br>Policy Research Center interlocutors reviewed succession 
<br>concerns in both Saudi Arabia and Egypt.  Bar argued that a 
<br>perceived closure in the capability gap between Israel and 
<br>Arab states, coupled with a nuclear-armed Iran, could compel 
<br>moderate Arab states to reassess the notion that Israel was a 
<br>fixture in the region. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (S) Typically frank, MOD Political-Military Chief Amos 
<br>Gilad was not certain how much longer Egyptian President 
<br>Mubarak would live, and questioned whether his son Gamal was 
<br>ready to assume command.  Gilad said the Egyptian military 
<br>led by Defense Minister Tantawi continues to train and 
<br>exercise as if "Israel was its only enemy."  He added that 
<br>there were disturbing signs on the Egyptian streets, as women 
<br>are dressed more conservatively, and that peace with Israel 
<br>"is too thin, too superficial."  On Saudi Arabia, Gilad said 
<br>that King Abdullah does not hate Israel, but his chief 
<br>priority is the survival of the regime. 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (S) The GOI official response to the arms transfer 
<br>non-paper includes several objections, such as the potential 
<br>transfer of systems for the F-15SA to Saudi Arabia, including 
<br>the Enhanced Paveway II, Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System, 
<br>and AESA radar.  Buchris said the GOI is ready to establish a 
<br>working group to discuss the F-15SA transfer, and proposed an 
<br>Israeli technical team accompany BG Heymann to Washington (in 
<br>town for a missile defense meeting) on August 3 to discuss 
<br>the issue further.  Buchris said the sale of the F-15SA was 
<br>not the problem, but rather the weapons systems included on 
<br>the planes and the location of the planes in Saudi Arabia. 
<br> 
<br>Lebanon 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (S) The GOI remains concerned about U.S. arms transfers to 
<br>the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF), and has requested the 
<br>opportunity to discuss further U.S. intentions regarding the 
<br>LAF.  A/S Shapiro said the results of the Lebanese elections 
<br>represented a turning point, and rejection of Hizballah and 
<br>its Iranian sponsors.  The need to build up Lebanese 
<br>institutions, including the army, was now more important than 
<br>ever, he argued.  A/S Shapiro said the LAF has thus far 
<br>demonstrated a solid record of accounting for U.S. systems 
<br>transferred to Lebanon. 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (S) Buchris acknowledged that the elections in Lebanon 
<br>were positive, but countered that Hizballah's influence 
<br>remains strong.  He argued that items such as the Cessna 
<br>Caravan and the Raven unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) lack 
<br>sufficient mitigation measures, which creates the potential 
<br>for an incident along the Israel-Lebanese border.  Amos Gilad 
<br>said the GOI does not believe the LAF will attack Israel. 
<br>However, given the ties between Hizballah and the LAF, he was 
<br>certain the IDF would eventually face the LAF in any conflict 
<br>with Hizballah. 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (S) Analysts from the MFA's Center for Policy Research 
<br>argued there has been no dramatic change in the political 
<br>arena despite the March 14 coalition's significant victory in 
<br>the elections.  They said the fragile political situation in 
<br>Lebanon is currently stable, but Hizballah still possesses an 
<br>unofficial veto over policy.  Long term prospects will be 
<br>tested by the Hariri Tribunal and Hizballah's desire for a 
<br>reprisal to the 2008 Mughniyeh assassination.  MFA Policy 
<br>Research analysts further argued that the LAF faces 
<br>tremendous pressure following the recent explosion of a 
<br>Hizballah arms cache near the Lebanese-Israeli border.  MFA 
<br>DG Yossi Gal noted that UNIFIL had been prevented from 
<br>investigating the explosion, and raised the recent crossing 
<br>by Lebanese citizens into Israeli territory to plant Lebanese 
<br>and Hizballah flags.  He said French and Italian delegations 
<br>had praised the GOI's restraint in these cases. 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (S) A/S Shapiro asked if the election results might be 
<br>the result in part of a backlash in the Christian community 
<br>against Hizballah; the Policy Research analysts countered 
<br>that the results were indicative of several factors, 
<br>including the influx of Saudi money and an unstable 
<br>opposition camp.  They agreed that Hizballah leader Nasrallah 
<br>might be a bit chastened following the elections, as 
<br>suggested by A/S Shapiro, but that Hizballah continues to try 
<br>and undermine the March 14 coalition. 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (S) During the MOD roundtable discussion, BG Heymann also 
<br>acknowledged the positive results of the elections.  However, 
<br>he feared the outcome did not represent the real power of the 
<br>Shi'ites in Lebanon.  He agreed that moderates and the LAF 
<br>must be strengthened, but expressed deep concerns about 
<br>ongoing cooperation between Hizballah and the LAF.  He also 
<br>said that such aid to Lebanon be paired with efforts to halt 
<br>smuggling and directly weaken Hizballah. 
<br> 
<br>¶14. (S) BG Heymann also cited concerns regarding mitigation 
<br>measures for the Caravan and Raven in order to prevent an 
<br>"accidental engagement" by the IAF.  Overall, he was 
<br>skeptical that these systems would benefit the LAF, and said 
<br>the GOI would appreciate a more in-depth conversation 
<br>regarding U.S. intentions and overarching strategy with 
<br>respect to the LAF.  Heymann suggested further talks to 
<br>coincide with the August 3rd F-15 technical discussion in 
<br>Washington; MFA DDG Bar echoed this request.  A/S Shapiro 
<br>offered to take that back to Washington for review.  If it 
<br>proved too difficult on short notice to bring together 
<br>interagency experts to discuss US intentions with the LAF, 
<br>A/S Shapiro suggested it be included in the Joint Political 
<br>Military Group talks later in the fall. 
<br> 
<br>Iran 
<br>---- 
<br> 
<br>¶15. (S) Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons remains the GOI's 
<br>primary focus.  Buchris stated bluntly that it was not clear 
<br>to him where U.S. policy was heading with regard to Iran.  In 
<br>separate meetings, Buchris and Amos Gilad said that Israel's 
<br>preeminent priority is to prevent Iran's nuclear weapons 
<br>program, which if realized would cause a nuclear arms race 
<br>across the Middle East as Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Egypt 
<br>pursue similar programs in response.  Gilad was skeptical 
<br> 
<br>that engagement would work, noting Iranian desires to 
<br>"establish a new empire" and pointing to Iranian support for 
<br>Hizballah and "Hamastan." Buchris added that the United 
<br>States' desire to engage with Iran should be accompanied by 
<br>tough sanctions, and only pursued for a finite period of 
<br>time; MFA DG Gal concurred.  Alluding to a potential military 
<br>strike, Buchris said "all options must remain on the table," 
<br>and acknowledged that part of his job was insuring Israel was 
<br>ready to employ such an option, no matter how undesirable it 
<br>may be. 
<br> 
<br>¶16. (S) A/S Shapiro made clear that a nuclear armed Iran was 
<br>unacceptable to the United States.  He referenced Secretary 
<br>Clinton's July 15 foreign policy address at the Council on 
<br>Foreign Relations, noting the offer of engagement with Iran 
<br>-- but reinforcing that such an offer is not indefinite.  A/S 
<br>Shapiro argued that an Iranian rejection of our offer to 
<br>engage will only help bolster international support for 
<br>increased sanctions.  He also pointed to the uncertain 
<br>situation following the Iranian elections -- it was unclear 
<br>at this point how the regime in Tehran will react to our 
<br>offer of engagement.  That said, he repeated that the 
<br>engagement offer was not unlimited, noting that the United 
<br>States will reassess its engagement strategy with Iran later 
<br>this fall. 
<br> 
<br>¶17. (S) A/S Shapiro cited a commonality of interests with the 
<br>Gulf States, which also view Iran as the preeminent threat -- 
<br>we should take advantage of this commonality, he said. 
<br>During the J5 roundtable discussion, IDF interlocutors 
<br>expressed skepticism that proposed military assistance to the 
<br>Gulf would help against Iran, as some of the systems slated 
<br>for delivery are not designed to counter the threats, nuclear 
<br>and asymmetrical, posed by Iran.  A/S Shapiro agreed that 
<br>assistance to Gulf states should not diminish Israel's QME, 
<br>but argued that it sends a signal to those countries (as well 
<br>as Iran) that they have strong allies in the West.  It also 
<br>helps convince these regimes that their best interests lie 
<br>with the moderate camp rather than with Iran. 
<br> 
<br>¶18. (S) Buchris said the lack of an appointed U.S. special 
<br>envoy focusing on Iran suggested the United States did not 
<br>believe Iran was a priority.  A/S Shapiro reassured Buchris 
<br>that Iran was a top priority as President Obama and Secretary 
<br>Clinton are intensely focused on Iran.  The fact that Tehran 
<br>has not responded to our offer of engagement makes a special 
<br>envoy responsible for negotiations not as important, A/S 
<br>Shapiro said -- in any case, much of the discussion will be 
<br>behind the scenes. 
<br> 
<br>¶19. (S) Buchris referenced a press report from Secretary 
<br>Clinton's trip to Jakarta in which she said the United States 
<br>would consider providing a defense umbrella for moderate Arab 
<br>countries in the Middle East should Iran acquire a nuclear 
<br>weapon.  Buchris argued that such a statement already 
<br>conceded the idea of a nuclear-armed Iran.  MFA Deputy 
<br>Director General for Strategic Affairs Alon Bar also raised 
<br>the Secretary's Jakarta statement; A/S Shapiro stated that 
<br>the Secretary's comments did not indicate a new policy 
<br>approach, but were meant as a deterrent factor toward Iran's 
<br>nuclear weapons ambitions -- not as a concession -- and that 
<br>journalists covering the trip attempted to make more out of 
<br>the statement than was intended. 
<br> 
<br>¶20. (S) Amos Gilad referenced Russia's potential sale of the 
<br>S-300 missile system to Iran, noting that Russian 
<br>interlocutors initially denied the S-300 contract with Iran, 
<br>and then later admitted it had been signed but added that the 
<br>system would not be delivered for political reasons. 
<br>However, Gilad said the Russians would reassess this 
<br>political calculation should the United States continue to 
<br>pursue missile defense plans in Poland and the Czech 
<br>Republic.  He speculated that the Iranians would continue to 
<br>put pressure on Russia to sell the system rather than pursue 
<br>alternative Chinese systems.  He said the Russians appear 
<br>committed to preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, 
<br>but he personally had doubts about their intelligence 
<br>capabilities following their lack of knowledge regarding the 
<br>Syrian nuclear project. 
<br> 
<br>Peace Process 
<br>------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶21. (S) Buchris acknowledged that the Palestinian Authority 
<br>was doing a "good job" in the West Bank, noting respect for 
<br>Palestinian Security Forces (PASF) as they take more control 
<br>of security -- giving them the chance to succeed was 
<br>important, Buchris said.  He also commended the work of 
<br>United States Security Coordinator Gen. Dayton in training 
<br>the PASF.  That said, Buchris argued the way ahead would be 
<br>difficult, given the divide between Hamas and Fatah. 
<br>Reconciliation talks between the two have stalled -- Amos 
<br>Gilad said both sides are "more interested in swallowing one 
<br>another" than negotiating.  Behind the scenes discussions 
<br>with Hamas by European countries and even U.S. visitors have 
<br>not helped the situation, Buchris said.  A/S Shapiro deferred 
<br>to Special Envoy Sen. George Mitchell's efforts, but noted 
<br>Secretary Clinton's point that a stronger PA will offer an 
<br>alternative to Hamas.  He also stressed Secretary Clinton's 
<br>remarks during her July 15 speech that the United States will 
<br>not engage with Hamas unless it has accepted the Quartet 
<br>principles. 
<br> 
<br>Export Control 
<br>-------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶22. (C) MOD Defense Export Control Directorate (DECD) Chief 
<br>Eli Pincu reviewed the export control system, emphasizing an 
<br>improved process, but also acknowledging the potential for 
<br>improvement.  He gave a brief presentation regarding Israeli 
<br>export controls, including enhanced legislation, 
<br>cross-ministry coordination, enhanced enforcement, and 
<br>increased industry outreach and training.  He noted 780 
<br>registered exporters in Israel; for 2009, 31,373 marketing 
<br>licenses had thus far been issued, with 1,198 denials and 219 
<br>returned without action.  MFA Export Control Director Roey 
<br>Gilad stressed the partnership between the MOD and MFA on 
<br>export licenses, and explained the system's dispute 
<br>resolution mechanism in the event the MFA and MOD disagree on 
<br>a particular case. 
<br> 
<br>¶23. (C) Both Pincu and Roey Gilad noted that the GOI 
<br>continues to seek assistance in closing export control 
<br>loopholes, including brokering.  Pincu noted that brokering 
<br>had been included in the Defense Export Control Act, but that 
<br>accompanying implementation legislation had not yet entered 
<br>in to force.  Pincu said the GOI had consulted with Germany, 
<br>the United Kingdom, France, and Japan on its brokering laws, 
<br>and planned to raise it during the annual defense export 
<br>control working group to be held in Washington in October. 
<br>Roey Gilad and other DECD officials also hope to travel to 
<br>Washington in the near future to further discuss brokering 
<br>issues. 
<br> 
<br>China 
<br>----- 
<br> 
<br>¶24. (C) MFA Export Control Director Roey Gilad reiterated 
<br>that the GOI in no way desires to compromise U.S. national 
<br>interests with respect to exports to China.  He noted, 
<br>however, that the U.S. Department of Commerce created in 2007 
<br>a list of exemptions for certain items if sent to validated 
<br>end users in China.  Gilad questioned whether the same 
<br>exemptions might be possible for Israel.  As it currently 
<br>stands, the GOI must pursue any export to China through the 
<br>bilateral statement of understanding with the United States. 
<br>While the statement calls for expeditious resolution of any 
<br>requests to export to China, it often takes up to 80 days to 
<br>obtain approval.  By that time, Gilad said, China has often 
<br>found the item through another supplier.  Moreover, the 
<br>Israeli export control system requires a 20-working day 
<br>turn-around on all export license requests -- which is not 
<br>possible, given the length of time required to obtain an 
<br>answer from the United States.  A/S Shapiro offered to raise 
<br>the issue in Washington. 
<br> 
<br>JPMG 
<br>---- 
<br> 
<br>¶25. (SBU) A/S Shapiro suggested the next session of the Joint 
<br>Political Military Group (JPMG) convene shortly after the 
<br>Jewish holidays, most likely in October or early November. 
<br>GOI officials agreed in principle, and will look at the 
<br>calendar and propose dates. 
<br> 
<br>¶26.  (U) A/S Shapiro has cleared this cable.
