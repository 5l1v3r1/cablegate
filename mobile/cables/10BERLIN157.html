<br>SUBJECT: DEFENSE MINISTER ZU GUTTENBERG REVEALS STRUGGLE 
<br>WITH FM WESTERWELLE ON TROOP INCREASE FOR AFGHANISTAN 
<br> 
<br>REF: A. BERLIN 138 
<br>     ¶B. BERLIN 112 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: AMBASSADOR PHILIP D. MURPHY. REASONS: 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (C) SUMMARY.  Defense Minister zu Guttenberg revealed in 
<br>a February 3 meeting with Ambassador Murphy that coalition 
<br>partner FM Westerwelle -- not the opposition Social 
<br>Democratic Party (SPD) -- had been the single biggest 
<br>obstacle 
<br>to the government seeking a bigger increase in German 
<br>troops for Afghanistan.  But even with the modest planned 
<br>troop increase of 500 (with 350 more in reserve), zu 
<br>Guttenberg said a restructuring of the current Bundeswehr 
<br>presence would allow Germany to increase the number of 
<br>soldiers involved in the training of Afghan National Army 
<br>(ANA) by more than 1,000.  While Westerwelle has portrayed 
<br>his skepticism about additional troops as principled, it 
<br>was also motivated by a desire to put zu Guttenberg "in his 
<br>place."  While the size of the troop increase is settled, 
<br>the length of the new ISAF mandate remains open.  The 
<br>government is hoping to have the new mandate approved by 
<br>the Bundestag before the end of February, with significant 
<br>(if not majority) support from the opposition SPD and 
<br>Greens.  END SUMMARY. 
<br> 
<br>WESTERWELLE: BIGGEST OBSTACLE 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) In explaining the lower-than-expected planned 
<br>increase in the number of German troops for Afghanistan, zu 
<br>Guttenberg told the Ambassador that Westerwelle's opening 
<br>position in the coalition negotiations on the new mandate 
<br>had been "not one additional soldier."  In that context, it 
<br>had been difficult to get agreement on any increase at 
<br>all.  (Comment: Zu Guttenberg proposed 1,500 additional 
<br>troops at the initial January 4 mini-cabinet meeting on 
<br>this issue.  End Comment.) 
<br> 
<br>DOING A LOT MORE WITH A LITTLE MORE 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) To help justify the need for more troops, zu 
<br>Guttenberg said he had forced the Bundeswehr to do a 
<br>complete review of all the existing positions in 
<br>Afghanistan, which had confirmed that some could be 
<br>eliminated in light of the new ISAF counterinsurgency 
<br>strategy.  He said a restructuring of the current 
<br>Bundeswehr presence, combined with the troop increase, 
<br>would boost the number of soldiers involved in the training 
<br>of the Afghan National Army (ANA) from 280 to 1,400.  The 
<br>restructuring includes turning the battalion-size quick 
<br>reaction force based in Mazar into a "protection and 
<br>training" battalion.  A second such battalion will be 
<br>created in Kunduz by augmenting the existing infantry 
<br>company there with new troops.  Zu Guttenberg reiterated 
<br>that Germany strongly supports COMISAF's focus on 
<br>protection of the population and partnering with the Afghan 
<br>national security forces (ANSF), and that the German 
<br>"trainers" (i.e., the two new maneuver battalions) will 
<br>operate in the field with the ANSF. 
<br> 
<br>PUTTING ZU GUTTENBERG IN HIS PLACE 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) While zu Guttenberg said he is avoiding public 
<br>comment on whether the outcome of the coalition talks on 
<br>the new mandate is a "victory" for him or Westerwelle, FDP 
<br>Defense Policy Spokesman Elke Hoff told poloff separately 
<br>that Westerwelle's hard line against additional troops had 
<br>been motivated in part to "teach zu Guttenberg a lesson." 
<br>She claimed that zu Guttenberg had been too presumptuous 
<br>last fall in making speeches in Canada and the U.S. about 
<br>how Germany would significantly increase its troop 
<br>contribution to ISAF.  He might have been able to get 
<br>agreement on a higher ceiling had he engaged 
<br>parliamentarians first and showed "greater respect for the 
<br>political process." 
<br> 
<br>OPEN QUESTION: LENGTH OF THE MANDATE 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) Zu Guttenberg confirmed that the cabinet would 
<br>formally agree on the proposed new ISAF mandate February 9 
<br>and that the first reading in the Bundestag would be 
<br>February 10.  FM Westerwelle is scheduled to speak on 
<br>behalf of the government in introducing the proposed 
<br>mandate.  The government is aiming to hold the final 
<br>Bundestag vote on the mandate -- following two weeks of 
<br>committee hearings -- on February 26.  Zu Guttenberg was 
<br> 
<br>BERLIN 00000157  002 OF 002 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>confident that a large number (if not a majority) of 
<br>opposition politicians from the SPD and Greens would vote 
<br>in favor of the new mandate. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) A February 2 meeting of state secretaries 
<br>tentatively agreed that the new mandate should run, as is 
<br>the custom, for one year, expiring in February 2011.  Zu 
<br>Guttenberg indicated, however, that it might be preferable to 
<br>stick to the length of the current mandate, which expires 
<br>in December 2010.  He expressed concern that having the 
<br>mandate lap over into early 2011 could lead to a premature 
<br>debate on withdrawal, before the new strategy really had a 
<br>chance to work.  (Comment: Another option under 
<br>consideration -- and favored by some in the Chancellery -- 
<br>is a 18-month mandate, so that any debate on the future of 
<br>the troop presence would be put off until the fall of 
<br>¶2011.  But the MFA objects that this would only raise the 
<br>ire of the opposition and give them an excuse to oppose the 
<br>mandate.  End Comment.) 
<br> 
<br>REASSURING THE GERMANS ON COMMAND OF THE NORTH 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) Zu Guttenberg confirmed that Germany very much 
<br>welcomed the planned inflow of U.S. forces into the north, 
<br>especially the helicopter assets, which filled a 
<br>long-standing shortfall.  He noted, however, that many in 
<br>Germany question whether the U.S. will be willing to accept 
<br>continued German leadership of RC-North in view of the 
<br>increased U.S. presence.  Ambassador Murphy assured him 
<br>that the U.S. had no issues working for the German command in 
<br>the North.
