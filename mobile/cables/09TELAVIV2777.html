<br>SUBJECT: CODEL SKELTON'S MEETING WITH PRIME MINISTER 
<br>NETANYAHU 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: DCM Luis G. Moreno, Reason 1.4 (b) (d) 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (C) Summary.  CODEL Skelton met with Prime Minister 
<br>Netanyahu November 16 at the Prime Minister's office in 
<br>Jerusalem.  Their discussion covered Netanyahu's meeting with 
<br>President Obama the previous week, Netanyahu's interest in 
<br>resuming negotiations with the Palestinians, the Iranian 
<br>nuclear program and options for tougher sanctions, possible 
<br>negotiations with Syria, U.S.-Israeli cooperation on missile 
<br>defense, and Israel's objections to the Goldstone Report. 
<br>Netanyahu said his meeting with the President was the best 
<br>meeting that they have had.  He stressed that he had told the 
<br>President that he is ready to negotiate with Abu Mazen now, 
<br>and contrasted Israel's position with the PA's setting of 
<br>preconditions for negotiations.  Netanyahu listed steps the 
<br>GOI has taken to support Abu Mazen, noting that the PA is 
<br>"doing a good job" on security.  A nuclear Iran, however, 
<br>would "wash away" all progress as well as undermining 
<br>Israel's peace agreements with Egypt and Jordan.  Netanyahu 
<br>said that Iran is vulnerable to sanctions and urged the U.S. 
<br>to increase the pressure on Iran, with likeminded countries 
<br>if Russia and China will not support new sanctions in the 
<br>Security Council.  Netanyahu commented that there is broader 
<br>Arab and European support for tough sanctions than in the 
<br>past, although the Arabs may not say so publicly.  Netanyahu 
<br>praised President Obama's commitment to missile defense, and 
<br>commented that U.S.-Israeli cooperation on missile defense 
<br>sends a strong signal to Israel's enemies.  He thanked the 
<br>CODEL for the Congress' support.  Netanyahu said Israel faces 
<br>three main threats:  Iran's nuclear program, the build-up of 
<br>rockets and missiles in Lebanon, Syria and Gaza, and the 
<br>Goldstone Report, which condemned Israel for defending its 
<br>civilian population from years of rocket attacks.  Netanyahu 
<br>said Israel will need to ensure that a future Palestinian 
<br>state cannot launch rockets at Israel's international airport 
<br>or critical facilities.  End Summary. 
<br> 
<br>Let's Get on with Negotiations 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (U) CODEL Skelton, consisting of House Armed Services 
<br>Committee Chairman Ike Skelton (D, MO) and Mrs. Skelton, 
<br>Representative Steve Israel (D-NY), Representative Tim Murphy 
<br>(R, PA), Congressional Staff members Phil McNaughton, Michael 
<br>Casey, and John Wason, Military aides Colonel Jeff Koch and 
<br>PolCouns met with Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu November 
<br>¶16.  Netanyahu was joined by Deputy National Security Adviser 
<br>Rear Admiral (reserve) Avriel Bar Josef, media adviser Mark 
<br>Regev, policy adviser Ari Harrow, and a Congressional liaison 
<br>officer from the Israeli Embassy in Washington. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C) Netanyahu began the meeting by noting his 
<br>appreciation for his meeting with President Obama at the 
<br>White House the previous week.  Netanyahu described his 
<br>conversation with the President as "the best we've had so 
<br>far."  He said that regarding negotiations with the 
<br>Palestinians, he told the President, "let's get on with it." 
<br>Netanyahu stated that his government had removed hundreds of 
<br>obstacles and roadblocks in the West Bank, helping the West 
<br>Bank economy achieve a seven percent growth rate, adding "and 
<br>we can kick it up to ten percent growth."  Netanyahu said his 
<br>Bar Ilan address last June had been difficult for him, but it 
<br>had united Israelis in support of accepting a demilitarized 
<br>Palestinian state.  The current GOI had also restrainted 
<br>construction in settlements more than its past several 
<br>predecessors. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (C) Netanyahu then contrasted his efforts with the PA, 
<br>which he said is maintaining a "political and economic 
<br>boycott" of Israel, setting preconditions for negotiations, 
<br>supporting the Goldstone Report in the UN, and is now talking 
<br>about a unilateral declaration of independence.  Israel wants 
<br>to engage, but the Palestinians do not.  Netanyahu quoted a 
<br>Palestinian official as saying that the PA had "exhausted the 
<br>negotiating process," then noted that the Palestinians have 
<br>not even started to talk to his government.  The real 
<br>difference, he pointed out, is that Abu Mazen is facing 
<br>elections, while Israel has already conducted its elections. 
<br>Netanyahu also commented that the Palestinians had initially 
<br>expected the U.S. to "deliver Israel" on all of their 
<br>demands, but are now realizing that this will not happen. 
<br>President Obama understands, he stated, that Israel is ready 
<br>to move forward.  The alternatives to negotiations are bad 
<br>for everyone.  Netanyahu said that if Abu Mazen would engage, 
<br>they would confront all the issues.  The process would not be 
<br>easy, but it has to get started. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (C) Netanyahu said the West Bank had remained quiet 
<br>during Operation Cast Lead because the Palestinians do not 
<br> 
<br>TEL AVIV 00002777  002 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>want to live under Hamas' rule.  He asserted that according 
<br>to recent polls, Abu Mazen and Fatah would easily win an 
<br>election, even in Gaza.  Netanyahu stressed that he was not 
<br>pushing for the Palestinians to hold elections, but was 
<br>instead focused on promoting the expansion of the West Bank 
<br>economy by removing both physical and bureaucratic obstacles. 
<br> He acknowledged that the PA is "doing a good job" on 
<br>security, though he added that PA leaders are not aware of 
<br>everything Israel is doing to support the PA's security.  If 
<br>we could add a political process to the cooperation that 
<br>currently exists, we could get security, economic 
<br>development, and peace.  Netanyahu warned, however, that if 
<br>Iran gets a nuclear bomb, the peace process would be "washed 
<br>away."  Even Israel's peace agreements with Egypt and Jordan 
<br>would come under enormous pressure. 
<br> 
<br>Iran Sanctions 
<br>-------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (C) Chairman Skelton noted that his Committee is 
<br>following Iran closely.  Netanyahu said he had advised the 
<br>President to stick to the deadline on the TRR offer, adding 
<br>that it is also important to ask Iran to stop its enrichment 
<br>activities.  Netanyahu commented that there is a new mood in 
<br>the major European capitals in support of sanctions.  The 
<br>U.S. does not need to depend on the Security Council, but can 
<br>work with likeminded countries.  Sanctions should focus on 
<br>Iran's importation of gasoline, while also focusing on 
<br>opening up the information networks.  The U.S. should lead 
<br>the world toward tougher sanctions, or more of the Arab 
<br>states will start appeasing Iran, as Qatar is doing. 
<br>Netanyahu summed up his advice as:  "stick to the deadline, 
<br>be firm on the terms, and apply sanctions" if Iran does not 
<br>comply.  He thought Russia may be more inclined than in the 
<br>past, but it would be best not to count on the Security 
<br>Council.  Having set a deadline, the P5 1 should stick to it. 
<br> The Western powers at least will go along.  We should close 
<br>the gap between understanding the problem and acting on it, 
<br>he said.  Netanyahu said Israel's problems with Iran are not 
<br>limited to its nuclear program.  Even without a nuclear 
<br>umbrella, Iran is sending hundreds of tons of weapons to 
<br>Syria, Hamas and Hizballah.  The ship seized November 3 by 
<br>the Israeli Navy had on board two thirds of the amount of 
<br>rockets fired at Israel during the 2006 Lebanon War. 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (C) Representative Israel asked Netanyahu about the 
<br>timetable for Iran to achieve a nuclear weapon.  Netanyahu 
<br>responded that Iran has the capability now to make one bomb 
<br>or they could wait and make several bombs in a year or two. 
<br>It is important to bear in mind that the Iranian regime was 
<br>exposed as a fraud during their presidential elections.  The 
<br>Iranian people detest the regime and have shown great courage 
<br>in the streets.  The exposure of the Qom facility also helped 
<br>convince doubters in the international community that Iran 
<br>has a weapons program.  Iran has a weak economy and a 
<br>fractured political system, so it is vulnerable to sanctions. 
<br> The time to act diplomatically is now, Netanyahu     said, 
<br>adding that we still have a year or two to stop the Iranian 
<br>program.  Netanyahu said he thought President Obama 
<br>understands Iran perfectly.  The Arab leaders hope Iran will 
<br>be stopped, there is broad Arab and European support for 
<br>"vigorous steps."  Chairman Skelton asked whether the Arabs 
<br>would state their support publicly.  Netanyahu replied they 
<br>might not, but it would not make a large difference since the 
<br>Arab "street" will not rise up in support of the Iranian 
<br>regime. 
<br> 
<br>Ready to Talk to Syria 
<br>---------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (C) Regarding Syria, Netanyahu urged the U.S. to press 
<br>Damascus to stop supplying arms to Hizballah.  Noting that he 
<br>had stopped in Paris to meet President Sarkozy on his way 
<br>back to Israel from Washington, Netanyahu confirmed media 
<br>reports that Sarkozy had offered to mediate between Israel 
<br>and Syria.  Netanyahu said he would prefer direct 
<br>negotiations with the Syrians, but added that he would accept 
<br>France as a mediator.  President Asad, however, still wants 
<br>Turkey as the mediator.  Noting that Turkish PM Erdogan had 
<br>recently stated that he would prefer to meet with Sudanese 
<br>President Omar Bashir than with Netanyahu, Netanyahu asked 
<br>how the Turks could be fair mediators. 
<br> 
<br>Working Together on Missile Defense 
<br>----------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (C) Netanyahu said that in addition to peace with the 
<br>Palestinians and Iran, he and the President had discussed 
<br>joint U.S.-Israeli efforts on missile defense.  Netanyahu 
<br> 
<br>TEL AVIV 00002777  003 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>commented that he had personally visited the Juniper Cobra 
<br>joint military exercise.  The program has reached a phase at 
<br>which it is possible to monitor incoming missiles with a good 
<br>lead-time, but it is still very expensive to intercept "crude 
<br>rockets" such as those fired from Gaza.  The information 
<br>shield is moving ahead nicely, but the physical shield is 
<br>lagging behind.  Netanyahu observed that it is very important 
<br>for the U.S. and its allies to be able to defend themselves 
<br>against missile attack.  Chairman Skelton noted that U.S. 
<br>personnel who briefed the CODEL were very optimistic about 
<br>the program.  Netanyahu said only the U.S. and Israel are 
<br>currently working on missile defense.  This cooperation sends 
<br>a powerful message to Israel's enemies he noted, and thanked 
<br>the CODEL and the Congress for their support. 
<br> 
<br>Goldstone Report a Key Threat 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (C) Netanyahu commented that Israel currently faces 
<br>three principal threats:  Iran's nuclear program, missile 
<br>proliferation and the Goldstone Report.  Goldstone gave 
<br>terrorists immunity to attack Israel if they fire from 
<br>populated areas.  During Cast Lead the IDF send thousands and 
<br>flyers, text messages and phone calls to civilians, warning 
<br>them to get out of the way, yet Israel was accused of war 
<br>crimes.  Hamas and other terrorists fired 12.000 rockets into 
<br>Israel from Gaza, Netanyahu said, noting that Israel is the 
<br>only country in the world faced with threats to annihilate 
<br>it.  Netanyahu asked the CODEL to imagine a situation in 
<br>which Israeli Air Force pilots must consult with lawyers 
<br>before they can travel abroad.  Former PM Olmert, former 
<br>FonMin Livni and DefMin Barak could be hauled before the 
<br>International Criminal Court.  Netanyahu said he could not 
<br>accept that IDF soldiers could be charged with war crimes for 
<br>protecting their country from constant attack.  The deaths of 
<br>several hundred civilians in Gaza was "tragic," Netanyahu 
<br>said, but there was no deliberate targeting of civilians by 
<br>Israel.  Deliberate targeting of civilians is a war crime, 
<br>but what should Israel do when terrorists deliberately target 
<br>Israeli civilians and then hide within their civilian 
<br>population? 
<br> 
<br>¶11.  (U) CODEL Skelton did not clear this cable.
