<br>nd (d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Current polling data suggest that the 
<br>Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) and the Free Democratic Party 
<br>(FDP) could receive sufficient votes in the September 27 
<br>national elections to form a governing coalition.  The FDP 
<br>are strong defenders of citizens' privacy rights and these 
<br>views have led the FDP to oppose all of Germany's recent 
<br>counterterrorism legislative proposals, as well as voice 
<br>concerns about U.S.-German and U.S.-EU information sharing 
<br>initiatives.  Throughout these debates, the FDP has favored 
<br>data protection measures over the need for governments to 
<br>strengthen security-related information sharing for 
<br>counterterrorism purposes.  The FDP's strong views on 
<br>individual liberties and personal privacy could lead to 
<br>complications concerning law enforcement security cooperation 
<br>and data sharing.  Were the FDP to join the government, we 
<br>expect they would closely scrutinize any proposals for 
<br>security officials to access and/or share information 
<br>concerning private persons with international partners, 
<br>including the USG.  End Summary. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>THE FDP AND DATA PRIVACY 
<br>------------------------ 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) The FDP defines itself as a independent pro-business 
<br>party, advocating low taxes, open trade, and minimal 
<br>government intervention in business and private life.  The 
<br>party promotes European liberalism, championing freedom and 
<br>individual responsibility under a government "as extensive as 
<br>necessary, and as limited as possible."  The FDP's limited 
<br>government viewpoint shapes their views on counterterrorism 
<br>policy.  Following the September 11 terrorist attacks and in 
<br>reaction to a number of terrorist plots uncovered in Germany, 
<br>successive German governments have passed a series of 
<br>legislative packages that have strengthened Germany's 
<br>counterterrorism legal frameworks and broadened the 
<br>investigative powers of law enforcement agencies.  The FDP, 
<br>which was not a member of these post-9/11 governing 
<br>coalitions, regularly criticized these amendments for 
<br>infringing on citizens' personal privacy rights.  The FDP's 
<br>criticisms of security-related data sharing agreements have 
<br>also extended to the U.S.-Germany bilateral "Pruem-like" 
<br>agreement to share personal information on serious crime and 
<br>terrorism suspects (ref C), the U.S.-EU Passenger Name 
<br>Recognition (PNR) initiative, and elements of the Visa Waiver 
<br>Program that involve sharing information on travelers. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>FDP Objections to Counterterrorism Laws 
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) FDP parliamentarians and party leaders were strong 
<br>critics of the CDU/CSU - SPD government's introduction of two 
<br>new counterterrorism legislative proposals, the BKA Law and 
<br>the Terror Camp Law.  Passed in 2008 and enacted at the 
<br>beginning of 2009, the BKA Law increased the investigative 
<br>powers of the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation (BKA). 
<br> The most controversial aspect of the BKA Law was that it 
<br>permitted security officials to use a variety of technical 
<br>surveillance measures in terrorism investigations (Ref B). 
<br>Specifically, the law provides the BKA with the power to 
<br>conduct remote, on-line investigations of the computers of 
<br>terrorism and serious crime suspects.  The FDP strongly 
<br>opposed these measures as an unnecessary invasion of privacy, 
<br>despite the limitation of on-line searches to only 
<br>life-threatening situations (or threats to the constitutional 
<br>order of the German state).  These cases would require a 
<br>judge's advance approval and are expected to number just a 
<br>dozen cases per year.  Nevertheless, FDP parliamentarian Max 
<br>Stadler called the measures "constitutionally questionable," 
<br>and in a meeting with EMIN, Stadler feared that authorities 
<br>would carry out surveillance without sufficient evidence of 
<br>wrongdoing.  FDP parliamentarian Gisela Piltz warned that the 
<br>law would turn the BKA into a "super spy agency resembling 
<br>the FBI."  Former FDP Federal Interior Minister, Gerhart 
<br>Baum, blasted the law, saying it violated privacy rights, 
<br>freedom of the press, and the inviolability of private 
<br>residences. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) Earlier this summer, the government passed legislation 
<br>developed by the Justice Ministry that criminalized a range 
<br>of terrorism-related preparatory actions such as distributing 
<br>information on bomb-making and participating in para-military 
<br>training overseas (ref A).  The law was developed in response 
<br>to the September 2007 arrests in Germany of three homegrown 
<br>terrorists who had attended an Islamic Jihad Union terrorism 
<br>training camp in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region. 
<br>Justice Ministry officials and prosecutors have told EconOffs 
<br>that the new law has closed gaps in Germany's legal framework 
<br>that had previously prevented German prosecutors from 
<br>charging German citizens and residents with activities that 
<br>directly or indirectly supported terrorist groups.  Prior to 
<br>the passage of the law, the FDP criticized the draft as 
<br>unnecessary, claiming that existing legislation was 
<br>sufficient to arrest and prosecute potential terrorists in 
<br>Germany.  The FDP also criticized that law for allegedly 
<br>requiring prosecutors to be able to prove that individuals 
<br>who participate in training at overseas terrorist camps 
<br>actually intend to carry out attacks; that the law would 
<br>thereby permit the punishment for thoughts, rather than for 
<br>actions.  Justice Ministry officials have indicated to 
<br>EconOffs that these criticisms are unfounded hyperbole and 
<br>that prosecutors will be able to build strong cases against 
<br>those who undergo training at foreign terrorist training 
<br>sites. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>FDP Objects to U.S.-German Data Sharing Agreement 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) Immediately following the March 2008 completion of the 
<br>U.S.-German data sharing agreement to enhance cooperation in 
<br>preventing and combating terrorism and other serious crime 
<br>(aka, the Pruem-like agreement, Ref C), FDP parliamentarians 
<br>began to express concerns regarding the agreement.  FDP 
<br>members took particular aim at an article in the agreement 
<br>that calls for additional data protection measures to be 
<br>taken if special categories of personal data (such as ethnic 
<br>origin, political opinion, religion, trade union membership, 
<br>and sexual orientation) are transferred among law enforcement 
<br>agencies.  (Comment: In our discussions with FDP 
<br>parliamentarians, we explained that negotiators did not 
<br>foresee that such information would need to be transferred 
<br>regularly and that the article was inserted as a means of 
<br>providing extra data privacy protections in the rare 
<br>occurrence that such information was pertinent to an 
<br>investigation.  End Comment.)  In meetings with EMIN, Stadler 
<br>and Piltz also expressed objections to the data retention 
<br>periods of the agreement, questioned which USG law 
<br>enforcement agencies would have access to the information, 
<br>and voiced a general concern about potential misuse of the 
<br>personal information (names, DOBs, addresses, passport 
<br>numbers, etc.) that would be shared by the agreement.  Piltz 
<br>further claimed that the U.S. government as a whole lacked 
<br>effective data protection measures in comparison to Germany 
<br>and questioned why the USG does not have a overall federal 
<br>data protection commissioner as Germany does.  (Comment: 
<br>Piltz' remark underscores the importance of ensuring German 
<br>officials receive information about USG data protection 
<br>policy.  The April visit to Berlin by DHS Chief Privacy 
<br>Officer Callahan was useful in this regard, but more needs to 
<br>be done to ensure German officials understand U.S. data 
<br>protection policy.  End Comment.) 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) FDP leaders have also taken aim at U.S.-EU agreements 
<br>that include data sharing elements.  Following the July EU 
<br>GAERC decision to give the Swedish EU Presidency a mandate to 
<br>begin negotiating a successor agreement governing USG access 
<br>to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial 
<br>Telecommunications (SWIFT) database of financial 
<br>transactions, FDP head Guido Westerwelle called the plan 
<br>"totally unacceptable" and said that the "plan must be 
<br>stopped."  Parliamentarian Piltz, who is a member of the 
<br>Bundestag Interior Committee, has criticized the U.S.-EU 
<br>Passenger Name Record (PNR) data transfer agreement for 
<br>collecting "pointless" information on travelers and she 
<br>doubts whether the information collected under PNR would be 
<br>of any value to law enforcement officials.  In meetings with 
<br>EconOffs, Piltz broadly spoke of governments, particularly 
<br>that of the U.S., accumulating large amounts of data on their 
<br>(mostly) innocent citizens.  Piltz expressed concerns that 
<br>German commercial interests could be damaged when U.S. 
<br>authorities obtained PNR data on German business travelers 
<br>that might somehow be shared with American competitors. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Would the FDP be a reliable security partner? 
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) The FDP's voting record on counterterrorism 
<br>legislation and the views of leading FDP security policy 
<br>figures described here suggest that cooperation on security 
<br>matters, particularly those involving information sharing, 
<br>with a future German government that includes the FDP could 
<br>be problematic.  At times, the FDP's fixation on data privacy 
<br>and protection issues looks to have come at the expense of 
<br>the party forming responsible views on security policy.  The 
<br>FDP has been out of power for over 10 years and lack 
<br>experience tackling security issues in the Internet age.  The 
<br>FDP appears not to fully grasp the transnational character of 
<br>terrorism today and terrorists' increasing use of the 
<br>Internet and related technology to recruit, train and 
<br>organize.  Current Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble (CDU) 
<br>has repeatedly drawn attention to terrorist use of the 
<br>Internet, which he calls the "main medium of holy war against 
<br>the West - it is the communication platform, advertising 
<br>medium, distance university, training camp, think tank and 
<br>recruiting instrument for terrorists."  Schaeuble understands 
<br>that combating terrorism in a globalized world requires 
<br>international cooperation and for security officials to use 
<br>modern technology.  No FDP leader has displayed a similar 
<br>understanding of the need to find a proper balance between 
<br>personal freedoms and security measures; the FDP has all too 
<br>often found it politically expedient to cast these goals as 
<br>mutually exclusive. 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (C) At election campaign rallies last week FDP Chairman 
<br>Guido Westerwelle criticized the on-line surveillance 
<br>measures contained in the BKA law and championed the FDP as 
<br>the sole party committed to data privacy and protection 
<br>issues.  FDP parliamentarian Sabine 
<br>Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger has been suggested as a possible 
<br>Justice Minister in a CDU/CSU - FDP government, a job she 
<br>previously held under Chancellor Helmut Kohl (CDU).  Given 
<br>that she resigned as Justice Minister in 1996 after failing 
<br>to obtain support for her rejection of a CDU proposal to 
<br>expand the state's right to monitor private citizens, we 
<br>would expect her to closely scrutinize all bilateral and 
<br>U.S.-EU information sharing proposals.  In particular, a 
<br>FDP-led Justice Ministry could well complicate implementation 
<br>of the bilateral Pruem-like agreement, prevent negotiations 
<br>on a HSPD-6 terrorist screening data sharing arrangement, and 
<br>raise objections to U.S.-EU information sharing initiatives. 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C) An MFA official working in the counterterrorism office 
<br>noted that one reason the FDP has been so vocal in opposing 
<br>Germany's counterterrorism legislative drafts, bilateral and 
<br>U.S.-EU security initiatives is due to the fact that they are 
<br>in the opposition.  Pure political considerations dictate 
<br>that the role of the opposition is to oppose the governing 
<br>coalition's proposals.  Following this line of reasoning, 
<br>were the FDP to join the CDU/CSU in a governing coalition, 
<br>the responsibilities of power would perhaps convince them to 
<br>take a more constructive approach to counterterrorism and 
<br>security issues.  Furthermore, given that the FDP would be 
<br>the junior partner in the coalition, we hope that CDU/CSU 
<br>leadership would ensure that German legal frameworks are 
<br>adequate and that law enforcement and security officials 
<br>continue our current close cooperation and robust information 
<br>sharing on operational matters.
