<br>¶3. (C) Summary: During a bilateral meeting on the margins
<br>of the Progressive Governance Leaders Summit in Chile, Vice
<br>President Joseph Biden and Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis
<br>Rodriguez Zapatero discussed the need for a strengthened
<br>relationship and greater collaboration between Europe and the
<br>United States. Vice President Biden pledged increased
<br>consultation with Europe and called on Spain and other
<br>European nations to follow through on commitments with
<br>action. He also criticized the lack of consultation prior to
<br>Spain's withdrawal from Kosovo and requested Spain consult
<br>the United States earlier and in a more transparent fashion
<br>in the future. Zapatero defended the decision to withdraw
<br>but allowed that Spain could have consulted earlier with the
<br>United States. End Summary.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------
<br>Expectations and New U.S. Approach to Foreign Policy
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) PM Zapatero opened the meeting by congratulating Vice
<br>President Biden on the election victory and saying it had
<br>raised expectations in Spain and throughout Europe for a new
<br>relationship with the United States. Vice President Biden
<br>thanked Zapatero and added that expectations may be too high,
<br>and President Obama knows that high expectations have more to
<br>do with the failures of the previous administration than with
<br>his new administration.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Vice President Biden added that we want to change our
<br>foreign policy paradigm. We know that most of our challenges
<br>lie beyond the scope of the United States to confront alone
<br>and that President Obama genuinely wants engage in dialogue
<br>with partners around the world to develop consensus around
<br>solutions. We know what the pillars of our policy are, but
<br>unless we listen and work with our partners, it will not
<br>matter much.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Vice President Biden went on to say that Spain and
<br>the United States have worked as great partners in Iraq and
<br>we need to enhance the cooperation between our two countries.
<br>The relationship has not been all positive in recent years
<br>but there was no reason why it could not change instantly.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Zapatero responded that managing the relationship
<br>between the United States and Spain under the Bush
<br>administration was easy for him. Whatever position the Bush
<br>Administration took, he would take the opposite and see his
<br>domestic poll numbers increase. Sarcastically, Zapatero said
<br>"for that I will always be grateful to the Bush
<br>Administration." Now, however, Spain, and Europe in general,
<br>want a change in the relationship with the United States.
<br>Europe is a group of countries that the United States can
<br>trust. We share the same general outlook and, to a great
<br>extent, the same strategic interests. Europe wants to see a
<br>United States that shares decision making on global issues
<br>and listens to everyone, rather than pushing a single
<br>dogmatic view as with the Bush administration. Europe is the
<br>world's greatest debating club which--despite numerous
<br>cultures, 27 countries, and 20 languages--can still reach
<br>consensus. Were Europeans to be a little bolder, they would
<br>have a great impact on world affairs. Now Europeans want to
<br>
<br>contribute to reinvigorated U.S. leadership by helping to
<br>contribute the best ideas and principles to help solve global
<br>challenges.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Vice President Biden said that for eight years the
<br>doctrine of "my way or the high way" had been ascendant in
<br>American foreign policy and that he had long spoken against
<br>this in the Senate. In his recent speeches at the Munich
<br>Security Conference and at the North Atlantic Council he had
<br>been a consistent proponent of collaboration and consensus
<br>building. However, consensus building can have the drawback
<br>of leading to the lowest common denominator. Working
<br>together, Europe and the United States must reach agreement,
<br>then implement plans and enforce the rules of the road.
<br>Despite being an ardent Atlanticist, Vice President Biden
<br>noted that Europe has been reluctant to act to enforce the
<br>rules to which Europeans have ascribed. The Obama
<br>administration brings good news and bad news for Europeans.
<br>Unlike the Bush administration, the Obama administration will
<br>genuinely consult and listen to its European partners.
<br>However, once a decision is reached, the Obama administration
<br>will be more aggressive in asking Europeans to follow through
<br>on its commitments.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Vice President Biden said regular Americans in places
<br>like Peoria and Albuquerque do not like being a superpower,
<br>they want others, such as Europe to help lead. When the idea
<br>of a European military force separate from the NATO command
<br>structure emerged, many in the Bush administration railed
<br>against it. However, Vice President Biden said he had been
<br>supportive of the idea and did not view it as a threat. In a
<br>light moment, when Zapatero said that the European Defense
<br>Force would happen, Vice President Biden extended his hand
<br>and said "I bet it won't." Vice President Biden said we
<br>view the U.S.-European relationship as an axis of world
<br>stability and we need to work together to strengthen it.
<br>
<br>------
<br>Kosovo
<br>------
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Vice President Biden said that we want to genuinely
<br>collaborate with Spain, but changing a relationship was
<br>difficult, and required reciprocal changes. For example,
<br>when Spain unilaterally withdrew its mission to Kosovo, we
<br>would have appreciated advanced warning and collaboration.
<br>The decision is a sovereign one for Spain to make and one
<br>that the United States respects, but we should discuss it in
<br>advance.
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Zapatero responded that there must have been a
<br>misunderstanding. Spain made the decision to withdraw a year
<br>ago and could not maintain participation in the mission once
<br>Kosovo declared its independence and was recognized by
<br>numerous nations. Spain is a fractious country with Basque
<br>(ETA) terrorist organization that has killed over 900
<br>Spaniards in an effort to split from Spain. Any hint that
<br>the Spanish government would support the dissolution of a
<br>country into regional components would be sensitive
<br>politically and could embolden separatists. Therefore, Spain
<br>could not continue to support a mission to Kosovo. However,
<br>Zapatero allowed, Spain could have conducted more
<br>comprehensive consultations with the United States ahead of
<br>its withdrawal.
<br>
<br>¶12. (U) The Office of the Vice President has cleared this
<br>message.
