<br>France ) 2004 
<br>
<br>OVERVIEW 
<br>
<br>In 2004, France made progress in a number of areas that 
<br>enhanced its already robust counter-terrorism capability. 
<br>The Perben II law entered into force on October 1, ensuring 
<br>domestic implementation of the European Arrest Warrant and 
<br>expanding the tools police, security and judiciary officials 
<br>can use to combat terrorism. In April, French authorities 
<br>discovered and shut down a network of the Moroccan Islamic 
<br>Combatant Group that was considered to be extremely 
<br>dangerous. In July, it took custody of four former detainees 
<br>at Guantanamo Bay and charged them with terrorist conspiracy. 
<br>All four of the detainees remain in pretrial detention and 
<br>trials are expected to begin in 2005. In October, French and 
<br>Spanish authorities struck a significant blow to ETA 
<br>terrorism in their arrest in France of two top ETA leaders 
<br>and in the seizure of significant arms and materials caches. 
<br>With these and a number of other high profile arrests and 
<br>convictions in 2004, it is clear that France continues its 
<br>aggressive and effective anti-terrorist policies. Despite 
<br>robust U.S.-French cooperation on counter-terrorism, French 
<br>officials continue to differ with the U.S. on the impact of 
<br>Operation Iraqi Freedom on international terrorism, with 
<br>French officials suggesting that Iraq,s liberation has made 
<br>the world less safe and increased international terrorism. 
<br>In 2004, four French nationals were identified as having been 
<br>killed while fighting Coalition and Iraqi forces in Iraq. 
<br>
<br>INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES 
<br>
<br>France continues to be an active and engaged participant in 
<br>the international war against terrorism. On the military 
<br>front, its special forces participate in counter-terrorist 
<br>operations in Afghanistan and a French admiral commands Task 
<br>Force 150, a multinational naval force that patrols the Red 
<br>Sea and the Persian Gulf to interdict the movement of 
<br>suspected terrorists from Afghanistan to the Arabian 
<br>Peninsula. At the political and diplomatic level, France 
<br>continues its engagement within the UN,s Counter-Terrorism 
<br>Committee and the G-8,s Counter-Terrorism Action Group. 
<br>France is a party to all 12 international conventions and 
<br>protocols relating to terrorism. 
<br>
<br>In 2004, France expanded its cooperation in international 
<br>judicial cooperation. With the entry into force of the 
<br>Perben II law, France incorporated into its domestic 
<br>legislation the provisions of the European Arrest Warrant and 
<br>strengthened its already extensive judicial and police powers 
<br>to combat terrorism. For example, the law outlaws websites 
<br>that post bomb-making instructions. In September, police 
<br>shut down three such websites and arrested a computer science 
<br>student for building one of them. In addition, France signed 
<br>with the United States on September 2 two new agreements that 
<br>updated a bilateral extradition treaty and improved overall 
<br>counter-terrorism cooperation. France and the Netherlands 
<br>were among the first European countries to sign such 
<br>agreements with the United States. 
<br>
<br>France and the United States continue to cooperate closely on 
<br>border security issues, including airplane safety and the 
<br>Container Security Initiative. Possible threats to airplane 
<br>flights during the 2003-2004 holiday season were investigated 
<br>jointly by US and French authorities. French police and 
<br>security services have been very responsive to US requests. 
<br>In addition, France is active internationally in proposing 
<br>bioterrorism safeguards and nuclear facility safeguards. In 
<br>March, the Paris Prefecture of Police announced the formation 
<br>of a specialized, 90-person firefighting unit that would 
<br>focus on combating nuclear, radiological, biological and 
<br>chemical terrorist attacks. Also, in May, the French 
<br>government simulated a bomb attack on the Paris metro to test 
<br>the ability of emergency services to respond. 
<br>
<br>On terrorism financing, France continues to develop the 
<br>competencies and capabilities of TRACFIN, the Ministry of 
<br>Finance,s terrorism financing coordination and investigation 
<br>unit. TRACFIN has expanded the number of economic sectors it 
<br>monitors within the French economy, with a particular 
<br>emphasis on institutions, non-governmental organizations and 
<br>small enterprises suspected of having ties to Islamic 
<br>terrorism. At the level of the European Union, France plays 
<br>an active role in the Clearinghouse, the Union,s terrorism 
<br>financing coordination body. France has designated as 
<br>terrorist groups those that appear on the EU list of 
<br>terrorist organizations. As of yet, it has not designated 
<br>Hamas-affiliated charities, arguing that they have no links 
<br>to terrorism. It also, along with its EU partners, has not 
<br>designated Lebanese Hizballah as a terrorist organization. 
<br>
<br>French authorities consistently condemn terrorist acts and 
<br>have made no public statements in support of a 
<br>terrorist-supporting country on a terrorism issue. 
<br>Nevertheless, France, along with its EU partners, retains 
<br>diplomatic relations with all of the governments designated 
<br>as state sponsors of terrorism, with the exception of North 
<br>Korea. In 2004 it cosponsored with the United States UN 
<br>Security Council Resolution 1559, which targeted Syrian 
<br>domination of Lebanon and called for dismantlement of armed 
<br>groups and militias in Lebanon and extension of Lebanese 
<br>government control throughout Lebanese territory, to include 
<br>areas under the de facto control of Hizballah. 
<br>
<br>DOMESTIC ACTIVITIES 
<br>
<br>France is perhaps best known for its seasoned and aggressive 
<br>counter-terrorism police forces and judiciary. Within the 
<br>Ministry of Interior, the DST (internal security service), RG 
<br>(police intelligence), DNAT (counter-terrorism brigade) and 
<br>Brigade Criminelle (criminal investigations) all play 
<br>important roles in French counter-terrorism work. In 2004, 
<br>as part of a move to improve cooperation among France,s 
<br>security services, a new terrorism coordination cell was 
<br>created that will be based in the headquarters of the DGSE, 
<br>France,s external intelligence service and part of the 
<br>Ministry of Defense. Personnel from the RG and the DST will 
<br>be part of the coordination unit. This new initiative adds 
<br>another coordination body to an already crowded field. Other 
<br>coordination mechanisms include UCLAT (a counter-terrorism 
<br>coordination unit with the Ministry of Interior), the SGDN 
<br>(attached to the office of the Prime Minister), the 
<br>Intelligence Council and the Council for Internal Security 
<br>(attached to the office of the President.) There is 
<br>virtually no legislative oversight of intelligence and 
<br>security agencies. 
<br>
<br>Terrorism investigations that may lead to criminal charges 
<br>are handled by the counter-terrorism section of the Paris 
<br>Prosecutor,s office. Investigative judges, who in the 
<br>French system combine prosecutorial and judicial powers, 
<br>concentrate on Islamic/international terrorism, Basque/ETA 
<br>terrorism and terrorism linked to Corsican separatist groups. 
<br>Their mandate is extensive, and includes terrorist acts on 
<br>French soil and acts abroad that affect French citizens. 
<br>Their powers are substantial and they are given wide freedom 
<br>to investigate. They cooperate closely with French police 
<br>and security services. 
<br>
<br>Under French law, terrorism suspects may be detained for up 
<br>to 96 hours before charges are filed. In addition, suspects 
<br>can be held for up to three and a half years in pretrial 
<br>detention while the investigation against them continues. 
<br>There is general public acceptance of these measures. 
<br>Olivier Roy, a French terrorism expert, told the Associated 
<br>Press on December 7 that &there,s a tradition in France of 
<br>a strong state and people want to have a strong state.8 
<br>Barring the revelation of serious abuses, there is little 
<br>indication that French citizens would want to decrease the 
<br>extensive powers given to French investigating judges, police 
<br>and security services. 
<br>
<br>French police and intelligence services within the Interior 
<br>Ministry have extensive powers of surveillance, monitoring 
<br>and administrative detention. These powers were enhanced 
<br>with the March 9 passage of Perben II (with entry into force 
<br>on October 1) and include expanded detention (up to four days 
<br>before charges must be brought), more authority for police to 
<br>go undercover, warrants for searches at night, more leeway in 
<br>granting document searches, and increased authority to 
<br>wiretap. These expanded powers are to be used only in cases 
<br>that involve investigation of organizations &that imperil 
<br>society,8 such as the mafia, drug traffickers and terrorist 
<br>organizations. Even if government authorities are found to 
<br>have misused their new powers, any evidence they have found 
<br>would still be accepted in court. 
<br>
<br>Judicial and police investigations following the high-profile 
<br>arrests in 2003 of German national Christian Ganczarski and 
<br>Moroccan national Karim Mehdi continued in 2004. Ganczarski 
<br>and Mehdi, who are suspected of ties to al-Qaida, remain in 
<br>pretrial detention in France. 
<br>
<br>The investigation into the activities of suspected terrorist 
<br>Djamel Beghal concluded in late 2004. His trial, as well as 
<br>the trials of seven associates, will begin January 3, 2005. 
<br>The Beghal network is suspected of planning to commit a 
<br>number of terrorist acts, including an attack on the US 
<br>Embassy in Paris. 
<br>
<br>French police and judicial authorities arrested six suspected 
<br>members of the Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group (GICM) on 
<br>April 5. An investigation into their activities is ongoing. 
<br>The six suspects are being held in pretrial detention. The 
<br>GICM cell is thought to have provided logistical support to 
<br>those who committed the attacks against Madrid trains on 
<br>March 11. French authorities also arrested five individuals 
<br>in mid-November on charges of stealing one million euros from 
<br>a Brinks delivery truck that restocked ATM machines. These 
<br>individuals are suspected of having links with the GICM cell. 
<br>
<br>Judicial and police investigations are also continuing in the 
<br>&Chechen network,8 a loose grouping that is reported to 
<br>have links with the Beghal network and the Frankfurt network 
<br>(which attempted in 2000 to attack cultural sites in 
<br>Strasbourg, including the cathedral). Members of the Chechen 
<br>network reportedly were interested in using chemical agents 
<br>to commit terrorist attacks. French authorities arrested 
<br>Zinnedine Khalid on June 14, one of the suspected members of 
<br>the Chechen network. They also suspect that the Chechen 
<br>network may have links with a possible Asian network that 
<br>included Lionel Dumont, a French citizen in custody who had 
<br>lived previously in Japan. The trial of ten suspected 
<br>members of the Frankfurt network began in Paris on September 
<br>29 and is expected to last three months. 
<br>
<br>In May, a Paris court convicted two French citizens, Ahmed 
<br>Laidouni and David Courtailler, and an Algerian citizen, 
<br>Mohamed Baadache, for organizing recruitment networks for 
<br>terrorist training camps in Afghanistan. Baadache received 
<br>the maximum sentence of 10 years under terrorist conspiracy 
<br>laws. Laidouni was given 7 years, while Courtailler was 
<br>given two years in jail along with a suspended two-year 
<br>sentence. 
<br>
<br>Following the July 27 transfer of four French citizens 
<br>detained at Guantanamo Bay, French authorities successfully 
<br>argued in favor of their pretrial detention while judicial 
<br>authorities are preparing cases that charge them with 
<br>terrorist conspiracy. These arguments have withstood 
<br>multiple appeals by defense lawyers and the detainees remain 
<br>in pretrial detention. France has been one of the most 
<br>aggressive and proactive countries in prosecuting its 
<br>citizens formerly held by the U.S. at Guantanamo. 
<br>
<br>The French government publicly condemned acts of terrorism 
<br>targeting civilians in Iraq on multiple occasions in 2004. 
<br>Nevertheless, throughout the year, French government 
<br>officials, including President Chirac, continued to assert 
<br>publicly that the liberation of Iraq had made the world less 
<br>safe and increased international terrorism. These criticisms 
<br>reflect broader U.S.-French divergences on Iraq policy in 
<br>general. 
<br>
<br>Four French citizens have been identified in 2004 as killed 
<br>while fighting in Iraq. Amidst concerns that radical 
<br>Islamists with French citizenship were beginning to enter 
<br>Iraq to fight Multinational and Iraqi forces and commit 
<br>terrorist acts in Iraq, the Paris Prosecutor,s office opened 
<br>an investigation into a possible network of Islamists 
<br>recruiting French citizens to fight in Iraq. That 
<br>investigation is ongoing. 
<br>
<br>On October 8, an early morning bomb exploded in front of the 
<br>Indonesian Embassy in Paris. No one was killed, although the 
<br>bomb caused significant damage. French authorities continue 
<br>to investigate the bombing. However, responsibility for the 
<br>investigation was transferred to the counter-terrorism 
<br>section of the Paris Prosecutor,s office, signifying that 
<br>the French government suspects terrorism as a motive. 
<br>
<br>French and Spanish authorities have jointly made significant 
<br>progress in combating Basque separatist groups, including the 
<br>ETA. In early October, French police arrested Mikel Albizu 
<br>Iriarte and Soledad Iparraguirre, two suspected ETA leaders. 
<br>They also arrested at least sixteen other suspects, and 
<br>seized money and hundreds of pounds of explosives. In 2004, 
<br>the French and Spanish governments have formed two joint 
<br>investigative teams, one focusing on al-Qaida-related groups 
<br>and the second focusing on Basque separatist groups. 
<br>
<br>Despite a truce announced in November 2003 by the main 
<br>Corsican separatist movements ) the FLNC Union of Combatants 
<br>) the island continues to experience low-level terrorist 
<br>activities. Examples include the bombing of selected 
<br>commercial and symbolic sites, the machine-gunning of a local 
<br>gendarmerie post in October, and a rocket attack against 
<br>another gendarmerie post in May. No one was killed in these 
<br>attacks, most of which occurred at night. According to 
<br>French authorities, there have been 76 explosions at police 
<br>stations in Corsica over the last three years. French police 
<br>arrested in November twelve of 14 suspected members of the 
<br>&Clandestini Corsi8 group, which claimed responsibility for 
<br>seven recent attacks targeting Corsican residents of north 
<br>African ancestry. 
<br>
<br>At the administrative level, France continued its policy of 
<br>expulsions for non-French citizens engaged in what the French 
<br>government considered activities that promote hate. In 
<br>response to sermons from several Muslim clerics determined to 
<br>have threatened public order by calling for jihad, Parliament 
<br>passed a law in July stating that a foreigner can be deported 
<br>for publicly supporting acts of hatred, discrimination or 
<br>violence against any specific person or group of persons. 
<br>The highest profile expulsion in 2004 was that of Muslim 
<br>prayer leader Abdelkader Bouziane, who was first expelled to 
<br>Algeria in April, then returned to France after an 
<br>administrative court suspended that ruling. Bouziane, who 
<br>had made widely publicized statements condoning wife beating, 
<br>was expelled a second time on October 5. In addition, Midhat 
<br>Guler, a Turkish mosque leader and accused leader of the 
<br>extremist group &Kaplan,8 was expelled on April 29. 
<br>Although expulsions have long been a favorite tool used by 
<br>French authorities, in 2004 they gained more prominence. 
<br>Interior Minister de Villepin publicly stated he would make 
<br>expulsion procedures faster and easier. 
<br>
<br>In June, following the passage of a law giving new regulatory 
<br>powers to the Conseil Superieur d,Audiovisuel (CSA), 
<br>France,s FCC-equivalent, the CSA began sanctions proceedings 
<br>against al-Manar, a Hezbollah-affiliated satellite television 
<br>station, and al-Alam, a satellite television station based in 
<br>Iran. The CSA accused both stations of anti-Semitic 
<br>programming, propaganda in favor of suicide bombings, and the 
<br>diffusion of hate. The subsequent granting of a limited 
<br>broadcast license to al-Manar on November 19 was 
<br>controversial, and prompted Prime Minister Raffarin to 
<br>declare that al-Manar was &incompatible with French 
<br>values.8 After reviewing al-Manar programming after it 
<br>received its broadcast license, the CSA again petitioned the 
<br>Conseil d,Etat, France,s highest administrative court, to 
<br>ban the station. On December 13, the Conseil d,Etat agreed 
<br>with the CSA, and ordered al-Manar off French airwaves. In 
<br>addition, Raffarin has asked the European Union to weigh in 
<br>on the issue of &non-European8 media and their broadcasting 
<br>of programs that are incompatible with European values 
<br>concerning hate and anti-Semitism. It is clear that for many 
<br>inside and outside the government, stations such as al-Manar 
<br>and al-Alam pose a direct threat to French values, and in 
<br>addition, serve as a rear-guard action fighting the 
<br>government,s efforts to disseminate these values. 
<br>
<br>In February, the French government banned satellite 
<br>television station Medya TV from broadcasting in France. 
<br>Medya TV is affiliated with PKK/Kongra Gel, which is listed 
<br>as a terrorist organization by the European Union. 
<br>
<br>Worries over the rise of radical Islam in France have 
<br>prompted Interior Minister Sarkozy, followed by his 
<br>successor, Interior Minister de Villepin, to propose a number 
<br>of steps to combat this threat. Some, mentioned earlier, 
<br>focus on better coordination between the many French services 
<br>that deal with terrorism. Other steps focus on the need to 
<br>better integrate France,s minority Muslim population. 
<br>Villepin stated December 7 that it was unacceptable that &of 
<br>the 1200 imams who practice in our country, 75 percent are 
<br>not French and one-third do not speak our language.8 He 
<br>proposed, among other things, the creation of a foundation to 
<br>manage money destined for Muslim groups in France and offer 
<br>greater transparency and oversight of overseas fundraising 
<br>for Muslim institutions in France. According to the Ministry 
<br>of Interior, approximately 50 of 1,685 Muslim places of 
<br>worship are considered to have ties to radical Islam.
