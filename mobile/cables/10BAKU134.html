<br>SUBJECT: AZERBAIJANI PRESIDENT TO U/S BURNS:  "YOU CAN'T 
<br>BOIL TWO HEADS IN ONE POT" 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Charge Donald Lu, for reasons 1.4 (b,d). 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> ¶1.  (C) Summary:  President Aliyev used this coarse street 
<br>slang to describe the relationship between Russian President 
<br>Medvedev and PM Putin, but he might well have used the same 
<br>idiom to describe his concerns about Turkey-Armenia 
<br>reconciliation and the Nagorno-Karabakh (NK) Peace Process. 
<br>He told U/S Burns that the "Sword of Damocles" of the April 
<br>24 Armenian Remembrance Day is hanging over the NK Process, 
<br>as well as the Turkey-Armenia normalization process.  He 
<br>suggested that it would be easier if the Turkey-Armenia 
<br>normalization could be considered after April in order to 
<br>allow more time for progress on NK.  He also took the 
<br>opportunity to press the USG to apply maximum pressure on 
<br>Yerevan to make concessions on NK.  He stressed, "Now we are 
<br>trying to be even more flexible." 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (C) Summary Continued:  On Iran, President Aliyev said he 
<br>supported economic isolation and believed it could be 
<br>effective if enforced by a broad coalition.  He complained 
<br>about Iranian security provocations.  On a proposed 
<br>battalion-sized Afghanistan contribution, Aliyev said that he 
<br>would support sending a team to Georgia to observe the 
<br>training being provided by EUCOM to Georgian troops headed 
<br>for Afghanistan.  On energy cooperation, President Aliyev 
<br>said that if the Turks demonstrate "constructive behavior" 
<br>this year that a gas transit deal can happen.  Finally, on 
<br>the jailed youth activists, though he made no firm 
<br>commitments regarding their release, he said, "I think (a 
<br>pardon or amnesty) can be done.  I had no intention to hurt 
<br>anyone."  End Summary. 
<br> 
<br>Seeks Pressure on Yerevan to Resolve NK 
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C) Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Bill 
<br>Burns began his hour-long meeting with President Ilham Aliyev 
<br>by stressing that he was sent with the simple message that 
<br>Washington wants to build our bilateral relations and create 
<br>a stronger partnership.  He then offered his condolences for 
<br>the three Azeri soldiers killed on the Line of Contact on 
<br>February 18.  Aliyev responded that such events show that 
<br>there is no peace, no peace treaty and no peacekeepers 
<br>enforcing the cease-fire.  He worried more such incidents 
<br>could happen.  Burns commented that such incidents 
<br>underscored the urgency of finding a political solution on 
<br>Nagorno-Karabakh. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (C) The balance of Aliyev,s comments sought to convey 
<br>that he was ready to move forward in the Minsk Group Process, 
<br>but that international pressure would be needed if Armenia 
<br>was to move forward.  He said that it is now time to find a 
<br>final resolution, but Armenian President Sargsian wants to 
<br>walk away from the process.  "I told the co-chairs that 
<br>Armenia wants to delay as long as possible and escape at the 
<br>end.""  He said that Azerbaijan was prepared to do its part 
<br>to propel the talks forward.  "Now we will try to be even 
<br>more flexible." 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (C) Aliyev outlined several steps to persuade Armenia to 
<br>agree to the Minsk Group Basic Principles: 
<br> 
<br>-- the three co-chair countries should consolidate their 
<br>efforts at a senior-level, 
<br> 
<br>-- (C) the three co-chair countries should send a strong 
<br>message that the independence of NK is not under review, and 
<br> 
<br>-- (C) if these new proposals are not accepted, there should 
<br>be consequences in terms of international isolation, 
<br>especially in the form of Russia,s curtailing some of its 
<br>economic support for Armenia. 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (C) Aliyev noted that at Sochi, President Sargsian had 
<br>inserted a proposal for specifying a definite date for a 
<br>referendum or plebiscite on NK final status.  This, Aliyev 
<br>argued, undermined the entire framework of the agreement, 
<br>which is premised on an eventual referendum ) with no 
<br>definite timeframe ) in exchange for legalizing "the 
<br>illegally established regime in NK.""  He also noted that 
<br>Armenia is vulnerable to isolation because it is dependent 
<br>upon remittances from its diaspora, as well as imports of gas 
<br>and electricity.  "After 18 years of negotiation, we have 
<br>tested all options.  If this phase (of Minsk Group talks) 
<br>ends, what is next?" the President asked aloud.

<br>The Russian Role in NK and Russian Succession 
<br> 
<br>BAKU 00000134  002 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (C) In response to U/S Burns' question about the Russian 
<br>role in the NK talks, Aliyev responded that he was convinced 
<br>that Medvedev's efforts have been sincere.  He said that 
<br>Medvedev has personally met with the Azerbaijani and Armenian 
<br>presidents five times.  Thus any failure to make progress on 
<br>this issue will damage Medvedev's credibility.  He said that 
<br>at Sochi, Medvedev tried to persuade Sargsian to achieve a 
<br>breakthrough.  He added, however, that it was strange that 
<br>with so much pressure from Moscow and Lavrov's visit to 
<br>Yeveran, the Armenians not only resisted progress, but 
<br>actually backtracked on previously-agreed items.  In response 
<br>to a question, Aliyev said that he believes that PM Putin has 
<br>his own separate opinion about the desirability of an NK 
<br>resolution.  "I have no evidence, but I can feel this," 
<br>Aliyev remarked. 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (C) Aliyev said that he considers Medvedev "a modern, 
<br>new-generation intellectual," surrounded by people whom he 
<br>does not control.  He said that he has personally witnessed 
<br>Medvedev taking decisions that then required further approval 
<br>before they were implemented, referring specifically to a 
<br>border demarcation agreement that he had agreed with Medvedev 
<br>only to have it stymied by ""others,"" presumably in the 
<br>prime ministerial office.  He added, "Many high-ranking 
<br>officials don't recognize (Medvedev) as a leader."  He said 
<br>that there are signs of a strong confrontation between the 
<br>teams of the two men, although not yet between Putin and 
<br>Medvedev personally.  "We have a saying in Azeri, 'Two heads 
<br>cannot be boiled in one pot'" (crude street slang suggesting 
<br>that two leaders are spoiling for a fight). 
<br> 
<br>Strong Pushback on the Turkey-Armenia Normalization 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------- 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (C) U/S Burns stressed that the U.S. believes that 
<br>progress on the Turkey-Armenia protocols could create 
<br>political space for Sargsian to be more flexible on NK.  He 
<br>continued that the reverse was also true, that a failure of 
<br>the Turkey-Armenia process would almost certainly result in 
<br>serious negative consequences for the NK process.  Aliyev 
<br>said that NK progress would require a minimum of five or six 
<br>months.  He suggested that the entire Turkey-Armenia protocol 
<br>ratification process be delayed until after April 24.  He 
<br>said that the "Sword of Damocles" of Armenian Remembrance Day 
<br>is hanging unhelpfully not only over the Turkey-Armenia 
<br>process, but also now the NK progress.  "If there were no 
<br>deadline, maybe we could see how to combine our efforts (to 
<br>resolve NK)." 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (C) Aliyev pushed back with his usual warnings about the 
<br>negative effects of Turkey-Armenia protocol ratification 
<br>without being proceeded by NK progress.  He darkly predicted 
<br>postponement of any NK settlement; no comprehensive regional 
<br>security improvement; damage to Turkey-Azerbaijani relations; 
<br>no real partnership between Turkey and Armenia; further 
<br>isolation of Central Asia; the undermining of energy 
<br>projects; and damage to Georgia, both in lost transit income, 
<br>but also in its role as the sole land corridor between Russia 
<br>and Armenia. 
<br> 
<br>Relations with Iran Described as Tense and Unstable 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
<br> 
<br>¶11.  (C) U/S Burns explained in detail the steps the U.S. had 
<br>taken to initiate dialogue with Tehran and support the Tehran 
<br>Research Reactor initiative.  He ended by noting that, given 
<br>the rejection of these overtures, the U.S. would move forward 
<br>with another UNSC resolution that included new sanctions 
<br>targeting the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.  Aliyev 
<br>responded that although the visible side of Azerbaijan's 
<br>relations with Iran appears normal, the substance was very 
<br>different.  "I do not exclude that relations will be become 
<br>more difficult," the President added. 
<br> 
<br>¶12.  (C) "(German Chancellor) Merkel was very firm with me on 
<br>Iran, trying to persuade me.  I told her, 'No need,'" the 
<br>President recalled.  He said that he was supportive of Iran's 
<br>economic isolation and believed it could work if the 
<br>international community worked together.  He said that 
<br>earlier sanctions observance had been spotty with many 
<br>European energy companies working in Iran.  "Statoil supports 
<br>Iran more than it supports us!" he complained.  He noted that 
<br>Russian President Medvedev once told him that Russia did not 
<br>want the Americans to squeeze Iran, but also did not want a 
<br>nuclear Iran. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>BAKU 00000134  003 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶13.  (C) Aliyev said that Iranian provocations in Azerbaijan 
<br>were on the rise.  He specifically cited not only the 
<br>financing of radical Islamic groups and Hezbollah terrorists, 
<br>but also: 
<br> 
<br>-- the Iranian financing of violent Ashura ceremonies in 
<br>Nakhchivan, 
<br> 
<br>-- the organization of demonstrations in front of the Azeri 
<br>consulates in Tabriz and Istanbul, 
<br> 
<br>-- a violent religious procession recently in Baku, 
<br> 
<br>-- the use of the President's photo alongside the Star of 
<br>David on the Azeri-language Seher TV broadcast into 
<br>Azerbaijan, and 
<br> 
<br>-- conflict in the Caspian. 
<br> 
<br>¶14.  (C) The President added that Azerbaijan will not 
<br>reciprocate on the liberalization of the visa regime with 
<br>Iran.  He also noted that Azerbaijan is planning to create a 
<br>TV channel in Persian that will broadcast into Iran.  He said 
<br>that he did not understand why the Supreme Religious Leader 
<br>chose Ahmadinejad over former President Moussavi.  He joked 
<br>that perhaps it was too dangerous to have two ethnic Azeris 
<br>at the head of the Iranian state.  He said that the election 
<br>fraud was outrageous, with Ahmadinejad winning in 
<br>Azeri-dominated Tabriz and Moussavi winning in Tehran, where 
<br>it was harder to falsify the vote.  He viewed the situation 
<br>as very tense within Iran and believed it could erupt at any 
<br>time. 
<br> 
<br>Supports Afghanistan Troop Contribution, with Conditions 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
<br> 
<br>¶15.  (C) U/S Burns asked for the President's support to 
<br>continue our discussions about a battalion-sized contribution 
<br>of troops to Afghanistan that would include a U.S. train and 
<br>equip program.  The President said that he is aware of this 
<br>initiative and his foreign and defense ministries are working 
<br>on it.  He said that the fundamental problem is one of 
<br>""optics,""  claiming it was difficult for him politically if 
<br>it looks like the Americans are only training Azeri troops to 
<br>send them off to Afghanistan.  He said that it would be 
<br>easier if half of those trained would be sent to Afghanistan, 
<br>while the second half would remain in Azerbaijan or be used 
<br>for other purposes.  U/S Burns noted that the President's 
<br>suggestion would create problems involving the U.S. funding 
<br>of the training.  The Charge proposed that as an initial 
<br>step, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Defense Ministry staff 
<br>observe the training of Georgian troops headed to Afghanistan 
<br>by U.S. Marines.  The President thought this was a good idea 
<br>and instructed his aide to look at this suggestion. 
<br> 
<br>Pardon or Amnesty of the Youth Activists "Can be Done" 
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------- 
<br> 
<br>¶16.  (C) U/S Burns said that one of the ways Azerbaijan could 
<br>show leadership as a tolerant and secular country was in 
<br>advancing democracy and human rights.  He specifically asked 
<br>that, following the appeal process of the two youth 
<br>activists, the President find a way on humanitarian grounds 
<br>to release the two men.  Aliyev made no firm commitment, but 
<br>responded, "I think this can be done.  I had no intention to 
<br>hurt anyone."  When U/S Burns expressed the hope that the 
<br>government could quietly take this step, the President said, 
<br>"Okay." 
<br> 
<br>Russians are a Factor in Turkish Gas Transit 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶17.  (C) On energy cooperation, President Aliyev said that if 
<br>the Turks demonstrate "constructive behavior" this year that 
<br>a gas transit deal can happen.  He was clear, however, that 
<br>nothing would be signed before April 24.  He also professed 
<br>to be worried that active Turkish-Russian cooperation could 
<br>be one of the impediments to progress.  He confided that 
<br>Turkish Energy Minister Yildiz recently told the head the 
<br>Azerbaijani State Oil Company, "Why do you want to ruin our 
<br>relations with Russia?  Do you really need Nabucco?" 
<br> 
<br>¶18.  (C) The President continued that it is imperative for 
<br>Azerbaijan that formalities for the commencement of Shah 
<br>Deniz Phase II gas development begin this year.  This project 
<br>will bring $20 billion in much-needed investment to 
<br>Azerbaijan and potentially develop Azerbaijan into a major 
<br>source of new gas, as much as 50 billion cubic meters. 
<br> 
<br>BAKU 00000134  004 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶19.  (C) Unprompted by U/S Burns, Aliyev spelled out the 
<br>reasons Azerbaijan decided to sell gas to Russia last year, 
<br>noting that ""Moscow had asked" and offered a good price for 
<br>gas that was surplus anyway.  But the real reason, Aliyev 
<br>confided, was that the sale illustrated to "our Turkish 
<br>friends" that they will not be allowed to create a gas 
<br>distribution hub.  "Aliyev made clear his distaste for the 
<br>Erdogan government in Turkey, underscoring the "naivete" of 
<br>their foreign policy and the failure of their initiatives, 
<br>including the loss of support for Turkey among traditional 
<br>international friends because of Ankara,s hostility to 
<br>Israel.  He noted that in his view, there had never been any 
<br>merit to the notion of a "moderate Islamist" government in 
<br>Turkey, and that Erdogan,s insistence on promoting Hamas and 
<br>Gaza ) when other Arab countries were notably silent on 
<br>these issues ) had brought Turkey no benefits. 
<br> 
<br>¶20.  (U) Lastly, U/S Burns asked for the President's 
<br>assistance in resolving the long-standing difficulties in 
<br>finalizing the lease for the new Embassy compound.  The 
<br>President responded positively that he thought this could be 
<br>done. 
<br> 
<br>¶21.  (U) U/S Burns was accompanied by EUR Deputy Assistant 
<br>Secretary Amb. Tina Kaidanow, NSC Director Bridget Brink, and 
<br>Charge.  President Aliyev was joined by his Foreign Policy 
<br>Advisor Novruz Mammadov. 
<br> 
<br>¶22.  (U) This message has been cleared by U/S Burns.
