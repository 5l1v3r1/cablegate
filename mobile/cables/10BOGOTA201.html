<br>
<br>¶3. (C) SUMMARY: Deputy Secretary Steinberg met with President
<br>Uribe and his key ministers for nearly three hours, discussing a
<br>range of bilateral and regional issues. Uribe detailed the
<br>advances in security, education, economic and social indicators,
<br>and trade during his administration but said that Colombia could
<br>not finish the job without continued strong U.S. support. He hoped
<br>to bring an end to the armed conflict in Colombia through
<br>demobilization and social programs, but judged that the
<br>Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) would never negotiate
<br>as long as it enjoyed a safe haven in Venezuela coupled with a
<br>steady income from drug trafficking. Deputy Steinberg reassured
<br>Uribe that U.S. counter-narcotics efforts would remain a core
<br>element of assistance, noting that it was essential to address
<br>Colombia's broader problems. Uribe agreed on the need for prudence
<br>in dealing with the bellicose statements of President Hugo Chavez
<br>but asked for intelligence-sharing on Colombian terrorist groups
<br>hiding-out in Venezuela. Uribe said that coca cultivation results
<br>in the destruction of Colombian rainforests and thus climate
<br>change, and sought support for his Forest Ranger Family program to
<br>protect rainforests. The Deputy noted concerns about impunity and
<br>
<br>
<br>human rights. He reiterated U.S. support for moving forward with
<br>the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement (FTA) at an appropriate
<br>time, and urged continued work on sensitive labor issues for when
<br>the U.S. Congress is ready to vote. END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>-------------------
<br>
<br>Ending the Conflict
<br>
<br>-------------------
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) After a 20-minute one-on-one meeting with President Uribe,
<br>the Deputy Secretary opened the larger meeting by praising the
<br>"great partnership" between the United States and Colombia. He
<br>cited Plan Colombia's "positive but incomplete" results, calling
<br>for more effort to consolidate Colombia's security gains through
<br>reduced poverty and more equitable income distribution. The Deputy
<br>asked Uribe his views for ending the 45-year-old conflict with the
<br>FARC and National Liberation Army (ELN).
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Uribe recounted his and his predecessors' attempts to
<br>initiate peace processes with both terrorist organizations. He
<br>cited the GOC's success in facilitating the demobilization of more
<br>than 52,000 guerrillas and paramilitaries during his presidency.
<br>He outlined the GOC's poverty-reduction and land restitution
<br>programs aimed at increasing social cohesion and thereby
<br>undermining the terrorists' appeal. Uribe lamented that the
<br>Constitution of 1991 prohibited amnesty for perpetrators of crimes
<br>against humanity, which he claimed greatly restricted the GOC's
<br>ability to negotiate a peace agreement like that reached with M-19
<br>in the late 1980s. He also lamented that the GOC had failed to
<br>prevent the assassination of the Governor of Caqueta by the FARC in
<br>December.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Uribe concluded that the FARC and ELN's willingness to talk
<br>were hampered by the fountain of wealth from narco-trafficking
<br>(which makes them self-sufficient, unlike the past conflict in El
<br>Salvador) and the prospect of safe haven in Venezuela. Uribe said
<br>Chavez' support of the guerrillas had frustrated further GOC
<br>military progress against them. The President accepted that U.S.
<br>security assistance had decreased in recent years, but urged the
<br>United States not to back down in what was a "winnable battle."
<br>Deputy Steinberg reassured Uribe that U.S. counter-narcotics
<br>efforts would remain a core element of assistance, noting that it
<br>was essential to address Colombia's broader problems.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>----------------------------
<br>
<br>Paramilitaries & Reparations
<br>
<br>----------------------------
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Deputy Steinberg asked how the GOC was addressing the
<br>growing threat of criminal groups whose membership includes former
<br>paramilitaries. Uribe said the state had successfully recovered
<br>the monopolies on justice and security once held by the
<br>paramilitary and guerrilla groups, noting significant reductions in
<br>terrorist attacks, murders and kidnappings. Commissioner Pearl
<br>downplayed the role of paramilitaries in emerging criminal groups,
<br>citing a Colombian National Police (CNP) estimate that former
<br>paramilitaries comprised just 12% of the new groups' memberships.
<br>Pearl explained that this means there is a recidivism rate of only
<br>7.4% among the demobilized paramilitaries.
<br>
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Asked about the backlog of reparations for victims, Uribe
<br>declared that the most effective reparation was ending violence.
<br>Molano offered that the GOC budget for administrative reparations
<br>was increasing to $150 million in 2010 and would benefit 15,000 of
<br>the 275,000 victims currently registered under the Justice and
<br>Peace Law (JPL). Uribe reported that the GOC had just made a
<br>decision to confiscate more assets from former paramilitaries for
<br>use in reparations.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>-----------------
<br>
<br>Reducing Impunity
<br>
<br>-----------------
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Deputy Steinberg expressed concern over the persistently
<br>high rates of impunity, noting especially the release just days
<br>earlier of several soldiers accused of extrajudicial executions
<br>(EJEs, presenting murders by state security forces as deaths in
<br>combat). He also asked about a backlog of human rights cases
<br>waiting to be transferred from military to civilian courts. Uribe
<br>said the GOC had made the decision in 2005 to transfer
<br>automatically all human rights cases involving the military to the
<br>civilian justice system, where prosecutors decide whether to
<br>investigate the case further or refer it back to the military
<br>justice system. Minister of Defense Silva asserted that due to
<br>military reforms, EJE complaints had declined from 143 in 2006 to 2
<br>in 2009, according to a leading Colombian NGO. While Uribe assured
<br>the Deputy Secretary of his commitment to eliminate EJEs, he also
<br>vowed to defend the military against "false allegations" of
<br>wrongdoing. The Deputy Secretary urged Colombia to follow through
<br>on the Universal Performance Review initiated in 2008 at the UN
<br>Human Rights Council as a means of developing international and
<br>domestic confidence in its commitment to human rights.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>----------------------
<br>
<br>Working with Neighbors
<br>
<br>----------------------
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶10. (S/NF) Turning to Ecuador, the Deputy solicited ideas for how
<br>the United States could support further rapprochement between the
<br>two countries. Uribe raised the sensitivities caused by Ecuadorian
<br>legal indictments of former Minister of Defense Juan Manuel Santos
<br>and Colombian military commanders over the March 1, 2008, bombing
<br>of a FARC camp in Ecuador. Foreign Minister Bermudez said the GOC
<br>was trying to build confidence with Ecuador through social projects
<br>along the border. On Venezuela, Uribe advised "verbal prudence,"
<br>publicly ignoring Chavez to minimize the justification for his
<br>attacks. Uribe cautioned, however, that Chavez was "dangerous" in
<br>that he might seek to distract attention from Venezuela's growing
<br>social and economic problems by fighting with Colombia. Uribe
<br>thanked the United States for sharing intelligence on the
<br>activities of terrorist groups in Venezuela and urged continued
<br>cooperation.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) The Deputy Secretary commended Colombia for building
<br>security partnerships with Mexico and others in the region
<br>(reftel). He viewed this type of cooperation as an alternative to
<br>Venezuela's ALBA agreement and called for more positive
<br>opportunities for working with other like-minded countries in the
<br>region. He cited the Pathways to Prosperity initiative as a more
<br>hopeful model for cooperation.
<br>
<br>
<br>---------------------------------
<br>
<br>Coca Cultivation & Climate Change
<br>
<br>---------------------------------
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶12. (SBU) Echoing his statements at the UN General Assembly and the
<br>Copenhagen climate change summit, President Uribe linked cocaine
<br>production and drug trafficking with deforestation. Replacing
<br>rainforest with coca crops harms the environment, and
<br>narco-trafficking is not only a problem for Colombia but for its
<br>neighbors as well. Uribe highlighted Colombia's "Family Forest
<br>Warden" program, which pays approximately 90,000 families not to
<br>cultivate coca and to supervise the recuperation of destroyed
<br>forest. The President suggested that a variation of the program
<br>could be launched with U.S. cooperation and become an essential
<br>tool for protecting Colombia's jungles and forests.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>--------------------
<br>
<br>Free Trade Agreement
<br>
<br>--------------------
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Trade Minister Plata pressed the Deputy Secretary on
<br>passage of the FTA. He noted that several of Colombia's neighbors
<br>that produce the same types of products now enjoy FTAs (NAFTA,
<br>Chile, Peru) with the United States, placing Colombia at a
<br>disadvantage. Furthermore, he said non-passage of the
<br>U.S.-Colombia FTA had blocked completion of FTAs with Canada and
<br>the European Union because others were waiting to see how the
<br>sensitive labor and human rights issues would be resolved. Plata
<br>argued that the embargo imposed by Venezuela had already caused a
<br>30% drop in Colombian exports in 2009 and would probably deepen to
<br>50% in 2010. He concluded that Colombia cannot win with soldiers
<br>alone; Colombia needs economic opportunities to advance. Uribe
<br>added that many investors are awaiting FTA approval before
<br>committing to Colombia. He said in past years Colombia could
<br>afford to wait on the additional economic activity that the FTA
<br>would generate given the GOC budget surplus. He lamented that
<br>Colombia would have "much narrower fiscal room" in 2010.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) Deputy Steinberg responded that President Obama and the
<br>Secretary were aware of the need to pass the FTA, and further
<br>explained the problems posed by the U.S. Congress' legislative
<br>calendar and elections cycle. He noted that health care reform has
<br>taken longer than expected. He urged the GOC to continue working
<br>with the USG on labor violence issues and working conditions to
<br>"have everything lined up" when Congress is prepared to take up the
<br>FTA. He acknowledged that the goal should not be unanimous
<br>support, but that both governments must present the best case
<br>possible to maximize the chance for success.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶15. (U) Deputy Secretary Steinberg cleared this cable.
