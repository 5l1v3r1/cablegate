<br>SUBJECT: Bachelet Shares Views on South American Leaders with A/S
<br>Valenzuela
<br>
<br>CLASSIFIED BY: Paul Simons, Ambassador, Department of State, EXEC;
<br>REASON: 1.4(B), (D)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: President Bachelet emphasized the need to
<br>understand the nuances of Latin America's leaders and their
<br>countries rather than lumping them into populist and pro-western
<br>camps. During a January 12 lunch with A/S Valenzuela, Bachelet was
<br>relatively upbeat on Bolivia, reserving particular praise for
<br>Foreign Minister Choquehuanca and highlighting the many politically
<br>moderate Bolivians. She frankly described the challenges facing
<br>Argentina, from its weak institutions and lack of robust democracy
<br>to its unsteady president. Bachelet holds Lula in high esteem and
<br>feels that Brazil's leading presidential candidates are less
<br>impressive than their current leader. End Summary.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) President Bachelet hosted a small lunch for A/S Valenzuela
<br>at the La Moneda presidential palace on January 12. Foreign
<br>Minister Mariano Fernandez, Under Secretary Angel Flisfisch,
<br>Foreign Affairs Director General Roberto Ibarra, Chilean Ambassador
<br>to the U.S. Jose Goni, and presidential advisors Francisco Diaz and
<br>Marcos Robledo accompanied President Bachelet, while A/S Valenzuela
<br>was joined by the Ambassador, DCM, and Poloff (notetaker).

<br>
<br>Bolivia: More Moderate than Many Realize
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------------
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Consolidating the worldwide sense of hope inspired by
<br>President Obama will be the U.S.'s big challenge going forward,
<br>President Bachelet told A/S Valenzuela. Some leaders, including
<br>Bolivia's Evo Morales get caught in a trap of opposing individual
<br>U.S. officials and agencies. Similarly, there are many moderates
<br>in Bolivia, she said, implying that some in the U.S. don't realize
<br>this. Bachelet cautioned against lumping all of Latin America's
<br>populist-leaning leaders together, emphasizing that Morales was
<br>very different from Venezuela's Hugo Chavez, and that Morales had
<br>been fairly elected. Foreign Minister Fernandez and Deputy Foreign
<br>Minister Flisfisch added that Morales' MAS party was likely to do
<br>well in April's local elections, further consolidating Morales'
<br>power.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Bachelet had high praise for Bolivian Foreign Minister
<br>David Choquehuanca, who she said is more sophisticated than some
<br>other Bolivian leaders, and is "serene and capable." Cultural
<br>differences are important in understanding Bolivia and its leaders,
<br>Bachelet emphasized, saying that while she had discussed economic
<br>growth with Choquehuanca, he has a different mindset and is more
<br>focused on quality of life than economic development for its own
<br>sake.

<br>
<br>Argentina: A Challenged Country with an Unsteady President
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----------------------
<br>---------------------
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Bachelet was frank about her view of Argentina, saying that
<br>Chile's neighbor has problems with credibility as a country -- its
<br>democracy is not robust, and its institutions are not strong.
<br>Flisfisch added that Argentina's unusual federal system and
<br>Peronist ideology--which can lead to political paranoia--are
<br>additional obstacles to political and economic stability.
<br>Argentines tend to live from crisis to crisis, the President added,
<br>rather than pursuing stable, long-term policies.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner is emblematic of
<br>Argentina's problems, the Chileans agreed. Kirchner is not
<br>anti-U.S. by nature, Bachelet asserted, but is convinced that the
<br>2007 "maletinazo" incident was a plot against her and will not
<br>listen to contradictory evidence. (Note: "Maletinazo" refers to
<br>an incident in which Venezuelan officials found nearly US $800,000
<br>in cash the suitcase of a U.S. citizen at a Buenos Aires airport.

<br>
<br>
<br>A U.S. assistant attorney alleged that the money was illegal
<br>contributions for Kirchner's campaign. End Note.) In general,
<br>Kirchner is prone to believing rumors and scurrilous press articles
<br>and has a tendency to make unfortunate public comments, Bachelet
<br>noted, recalling Kirchner's negative comments after A/S
<br>Valenzuela's recent trip to that country.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) President Bachelet highlighted that Chile had achieved a
<br>very positive relationship with Argentina despite the challenging
<br>political situation there and Kirchner's shortcomings. Chile and
<br>Argentina have a number of bilateral agreements in place and during
<br>Kirchner's October visit to Santiago the two presidents shared the
<br>now-famous "Maipu hug" after recalling the historic friendship and
<br>heroism of both countries.

<br>
<br>Brazil: Presidential Candidates Can't Hold a Candle to Lula
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----------------------
<br>---------
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Describing Lula as a "political fox," President Bachelet
<br>asserted that Brazil does not play a major role in most regional
<br>issues, despite press reports that consistently portray the country
<br>as an important regional mediator. Bachelet views Brazil as more
<br>interested in playing on the world stage on issues including
<br>climate change and nuclear non-proliferation. On the other hand,
<br>Brazil has consistently been a good ally to Chile, she asserted,
<br>describing President Lula as intelligent and charming. Bachelet
<br>also offered her opinion of the leading Brazilian presidential
<br>candidates, neither of whom she believes share Lula's outstanding
<br>qualities. She described opposition candidate Jose Serra as
<br>arrogant and Lula's favorite, cabinet chief Dilma Roussef, as
<br>distant and formal.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Chile's Presidential Election: Worries about a Pinera Presidency
<br>and Press Bias
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----------------------
<br>------------------------------------
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Turning to Chile's fast-approaching presidential election,
<br>Bachelet proffered the widely-held belief that there is general
<br>agreement about policy among the leading candidates, and so the
<br>candidates' behavior and personalities are more important than
<br>policy differences. Nonetheless, she said that she was worried
<br>about a potential Pinera presidency, particularly because it would
<br>create a tremendous concentration of power (Note: Pinera is a
<br>wealthy businessman and a number of his key advisors will likely
<br>come from the business community. End Note.)
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Bachelet expressed frustration over the Chilean press'
<br>sensationalism and anti-Concertacion bias. Every time the Frei
<br>campaign raises questions about conflict of interest questions
<br>surrounding Pinera's very large stock portfolio, the effort is
<br>painted as a "dirty war" by the largely right-leaning press, which
<br>tends to ignore the right's missteps.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶11. (U) The Assistant Secretary cleared this cable.
