<br>SUBJECT: NEA A/S WELCH,S MEETINGS WITH KING MOHAMMED VI AND 
<br>MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS TAIEB FASSI FIHRI 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Thomas T. Riley for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: King Mohammed VI received NEA A/S Welch for 
<br>an hour on February 25. The wide-ranging exchange of views 
<br>focused on bilateral cooperation, the Middle East Peace 
<br>Process (MEPP), Iran, Kosovo, Lebanon, Mauritania, Syria, 
<br>Algeria and Western Sahara. In most respects, the audience 
<br>mirrored the meeting that preceded it with Minister of 
<br>Foreign Affairs Fassi Fihri and MFA Director General for 
<br>Multilateral Affairs Mohamed Azeroual. However, we heard 
<br>that Amr Moussa,s latest visit to Beirut had been "a 
<br>catastrophe;" the Emir of Kuwait did not plan to attend the 
<br>Arab summit in Damascus; and Morocco was looking at other 
<br>Arab countries' reaction to Kosovo's declaration of 
<br>independence. The King asked us to assist Mauritania and 
<br>warned that the POLISARIO must not attempt to occupy the area 
<br>east of the berm in Western Sahara. In his meeting with the 
<br>Foreign Minister, Ambassador Welch pressed for an agreement 
<br>on the status of the American schools in Morocco and informed 
<br>the Minister of a planned accord with the U.S. Holocaust 
<br>Memorial Museum. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>BILATERAL COOPERATION 
<br>--------------------- 
<br>¶2. (C) Receiving NEA A/S Welch, the Ambassador, DCM and Erin 
<br>Yerger, the Executive Assistant to Deputy Assistant to the 
<br>President for National Security Affairs Elliot Abrams, at the 
<br>royal palace in Marrakech on February 25, the King thanked 
<br>the United States for the excellent cooperation on 
<br>counterterrorism, the Millennium Challenge Account and the 
<br>Free Trade Agreement. Foreign Minister Fassi Fihri also 
<br>attended the audience. 
<br>
<br>KOSOVO 
<br>------ 
<br>¶3. (C) The King noted that he had just met with the Greek 
<br>Foreign Minister, who urged him not to recognize Kosovo. The 
<br>King and the Foreign Minister indicated that they intended to 
<br>discuss recognition with other Arab leaders at the 
<br>Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) Summit in Dakar 
<br>in March. Fassi Fihri said the Serbian Foreign Minister has 
<br>also requested a meeting. 
<br>
<br>MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS 
<br>---- 
<br>¶4. (C) Ambassador Welch began by underscoring that this is 
<br>an important year for the region and that the President is 
<br>determined to make progress on the MEPP. Welch briefed the 
<br>King and the Minister on the process and assured them that 
<br>the Israelis and the Palestinians are making progress, but 
<br>the public is unaware of it. On Gaza, Welch averred that 
<br>Israeli Prime Minister Olmert is focused on the least bad 
<br>option. For his part, the King expressed deep concern about 
<br>the humanitarian situation in Gaza. 
<br>
<br>LEBANON 
<br>------- 
<br>¶5. (C) Turning to the continuing leadership vacuum in 
<br>Lebanon, A/S Welch said that we see three options: 1) to 
<br>continue efforts to elect a President by consensus; 2) to 
<br>elect a President with 50 percent of the vote plus one; or 3) 
<br>to support the Siniora government. Welch indicated that we 
<br>increasingly believe the third option affords the best means 
<br>to support Lebanon,s institutions. Asked about Arab League 
<br>Secretary General Amr Moussa's visit to Beirut, Fassi Fihri 
<br>
<br>SIPDIS 
<br>characterized it as 'a catastrophe.' 
<br>
<br>SYRIA AND THE ARAB LEAGUE SUMMIT 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>¶6. (C) Noting that Kings Mohammed VI and Abdullah II of 
<br>Jordan had come to power at approximately the same time as 
<br>
<br>RABAT 00000185 002 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>President Bashar al-Assad, Welch decried Syria,s lost 
<br>opportunities. Welch said that he understood that the Syrian 
<br>Foreign Minister would be in Marrakech on February 26 to 
<br>deliver an invitation to the Arab Summit in Damascus, and 
<br>Welch predicted that attendance would be poor. The King said 
<br>he understood that the Emir of Kuwait did not plan to attend, 
<br>implying that Morocco would be represented at the ministerial 
<br>level at best. 
<br>
<br>IRAN 
<br>---- 
<br>¶7. (C) Ambassador Welch asked if he might say a few words 
<br>about Iran and its pursuit of nuclear weapons. The King 
<br>responded that he understood that Iran had suspended its 
<br>nuclear weapons program. Welch thanked the King for the 
<br>opportunity to clarify, declaring that the U.S. intelligence 
<br>estimate had been misunderstood and that the reporting on 
<br>this issue has been unclear. Welch said that we continued to 
<br>believe that Iran was pursuing nuclear weapons; so President 
<br>Bush was seeking a middle ground "between the bomb and 
<br>bombing," without giving up any option. Diplomatic pressure 
<br>is best for now. When the King asked what that middle ground 
<br>might look like, Welch said that more Security 
<br>Council-approved sanctions loom and that Iran must accept a 
<br>diplomatic solution. 
<br>
<br>ALGERIA 
<br>------- 
<br>¶8. (C) The conversation then turned to Algeria, and Welch 
<br>asked if the GOM had any views on President Abdelaziz 
<br>Bouteflika,s plans. The King said he understood that 
<br>Bouteflika was amending the Constitution to permit a third 
<br>term, and Welch noted wryly that Bouteflika was doing so 
<br>without Syrian assistance. The King praised the "frustrated" 
<br>Algerian Ambassador in Rabat for his tireless efforts to 
<br>improve bilateral relations, stating, &We have no relations 
<br>with Algeria, except for limited cooperation on security 
<br>issues." In spite of obvious opportunities for cooperation 
<br>in agriculture, energy and a host of other areas, President 
<br>Bouteflika and his government clearly prefer the status quo. 
<br>The King noted that he had even traveled to Algiers to try to 
<br>break the impasse, but the GOA continues to insist on the 
<br>Western Sahara issue being resolved before proceeding with 
<br>other bilateral or regional initiatives. 
<br>
<br>WESTERN SAHARA 
<br>-------------- 
<br>¶9. (C) The King and Fassi Fihri expressed grave concern 
<br>about the POLISARIO's stated plans to move people into the 
<br>area east of the berm. The King said bluntly that Morocco 
<br>could not allow that. Praising the King,s autonomy 
<br>initiative, Welch urged the GOM to press ahead with the 
<br>Manhasset talks. He said support for Morocco,s position is 
<br>growing ever so slowly. Separately, Welch cautioned the 
<br>King's intelligence chief against militarization of the 
<br>dispute. 
<br>
<br>MAURITANIA 
<br>---------- 
<br>¶10. (C) Looking at Western Sahara's neighbor Mauritania, the 
<br>King stressed that Mauritania needs help and that he will see 
<br>the Mauritanian President in Dakar. 
<br>
<br>AMERICAN SCHOOLS 
<br>---------------- 
<br>¶11. (U) Welch took advantage of a few private minutes with 
<br>Fassi Fihri to underscore the need for an agreement on the 
<br>status of the American schools in Morocco. Noting that he 
<br>had attended the Rabat American School (RAS)as a child, Welch 
<br>said if a solution is not found soon that RAS could not 
<br>produce more David Welches. Fassi Fihri replied that he had 
<br>
<br>RABAT 00000185 003 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>been in contact with Prime Minister Abbas El Fassi and 
<br>Director General of Taxation Nouredine Bensouda about our 
<br>proposal. 
<br>
<br>U.S. HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL MUSEUM 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br>¶12. (U) Welch also raised made the Minister aware of the 
<br>planned signing of an accord between the U.S. Holocaust 
<br>Memorial Museum and the Moroccan National Archives. Welch 
<br>also mentioned that the Museum still planned to host a 
<br>conference on the Holocaust in Arab lands. 
<br>
<br>COMMENT 
<br>------- 
<br>¶13. (C) Although his face looked puffy, the King appeared 
<br>relaxed and rested after four weeks in France. The meeting 
<br>itself underscored how much U.S. and Moroccan views coincide. 
<br>END COMMENT. 
<br>
<br>¶14. (U) NEA A/S Welch has cleared this message.
