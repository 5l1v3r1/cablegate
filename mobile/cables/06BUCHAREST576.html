<br>TAGS: CASC PREL PGOV PHUM RO
<br>SUBJECT: ADOPTIONS: ROMANIA OFFICIALLY REJECTS ALL PENDING 
<br>INTERCOUNTRY ADOPTION CASES 
<br>
<br>REF: A) BUCHAREST 0536 B) 2005 BUCHAREST 2550 
<br>
<br>Classified By: DCM Mark Taplin, Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (U) On April 5, Embassy received by mail a letter from 
<br>Theodora Bertzi, Secretary of State for the Government of 
<br>Romania,s (GOR) Romanian Office for Adoptions (ROA), dated 
<br>March 29 and including the final report of the GOR Working 
<br>Group established in June 2005 to audit pending petitions by 
<br>foreign families to adopt Romanian orphans and abandoned 
<br>children. Post has faxed the letter to EUR/NCE and CA/OCS/CI. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) The report shows that none of the 1,092 children 
<br>identified in the pending petitions will be available for 
<br>inter-country adoption, ostensibly for the following reasons: 
<br>
<br>-- 41 reintegrated into biological family 
<br>
<br>-- 12 integrated within extended family 
<br>
<br>-- 227 adopted by Romanian families 
<br>
<br>-- 17 adopted by other foreign families by the rules of the 
<br>adoption moratorium (2001-04) 
<br>
<br>-- 8 under legal guardianship in Romania 
<br>
<br>-- 12 reached or will soon reach age 18 
<br>
<br>-- 47 petitioned after a February 6, 2004 emergency ordinance 
<br>suspended even exceptional approval of intercountry adoptions 
<br>during the moratorium 
<br>
<br>-- 2 died 
<br>
<br>-- 6 not found in GOR,s database of orphans or abandoned 
<br>children 
<br>
<br>-- 90 had petitions withdrawn by the foreign families (1 from 
<br>the U.S.) 
<br>
<br>-- 132 in process of final domestic adoption 
<br>
<br>-- 415 not adoptable, protected within substitutive (sic) 
<br>families 
<br>
<br>-- 83 not adoptable, placed in the protection system (their 
<br>biological family did not consent to adoption before Court or 
<br>the Court did not approve the opening of the domestic 
<br>adoption procedure). 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Comment: The Working Group had been expected to issue 
<br>its report by the end of March, and Bertzi had announced 
<br>publicly in December 2005 that none of the cases would be 
<br>approved for inter-country adoption. However, the utterly 
<br>non-transparent process of the Working Group and the opaque 
<br>quality of the report suggest some of the children may in 
<br>fact remain in non-permanent situations in which their 
<br>welfare is not being adequately protected. Post believes we 
<br>should continue to press the GOR to open up the Working 
<br>Group,s "conclusions" for a transparent, objective 
<br>international review and to establish a legal framework that 
<br>would allow inter-country adoption for appropriate pending 
<br>cases. We will provide Department with our updated 
<br>recommendations soon. End comment.
