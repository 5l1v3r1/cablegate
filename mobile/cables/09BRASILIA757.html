<br>SUBJECT: BRAZIL: BILATERAL ACCORDS A KEY COMPONENT IN 
<br>COUNTERNARCOTICS APPROACH 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Acting Deputy Chief of Mission Marie Damour, Reason 1.4 
<br>(b) and (d) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Brazil,s strategy for dealing with the 
<br>trafficking of illegal drugs has focused in part on creating 
<br>a robust diplomatic framework in recognition that the 
<br>"illegal traffic of narcotics represents a grave threat to 
<br>the health and well-being of populations as well as a problem 
<br>that affects their political, economic, social, and cultural 
<br>structures of Brazil and its bilateral partners." As a 
<br>result, Brazil has signed dozens of bilateral accords focused 
<br>on achieving more effective cooperation with both regional 
<br>partners and countries outside the region in the area of 
<br>countering the trafficking and consumption of illegal 
<br>narcotics. The agreements evince a flexible approach *- 
<br>varying lines of authority, use of either structured or 
<br>ad-hoc frameworks, etc -* and willingness to tackle the 
<br>broad spectrum of complex issues involved in combating 
<br>narcotrafficking and transnational crime that could be useful 
<br>if Washington decided to enhance bilateral or regional 
<br>cooperation with Brazil on these issues, although it is not 
<br>clear that the GOB would consider its existing bilateral 
<br>accords to be a sufficient basis for a similar bilateral 
<br>arrangement with the United States or for regional 
<br>cooperation with the United States in the areas where it has 
<br>agreed to work bilaterally. End summary. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) This cable analyzes a sample of 21 bilateral accords 
<br>signed by Brazil between 1988 and 2005 (see appendix for a 
<br>list of the accords). While Post focused primarily on 
<br>accords signed with countries within South America, we also 
<br>looked at a small cross section of non-contiguous countries 
<br>in different regions around the world to identify patterns 
<br>and compare approaches. A subsequent cable will seek to 
<br>evaluate the extent to which the provisions of these have 
<br>been put into effect. 
<br>
<br>------------------------- 
<br>Categorizing the accords 
<br>------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (U) Brazil has signed bilateral counternarcotics accords 
<br>with every country in the region. Of these, Post examined 17 
<br>Brazil signed between 1988 and 2005. In addition, Brazil has 
<br>signed numerous accords on counternarcotics with countries 
<br>outside the region. For purposes of this cable, Post looked 
<br>at accords Brazil signed with Lebanon, Mexico, Portugal, and 
<br>Spain, which represent a cross-section of countries from 
<br>North and Central America, Europe, and the Middle East with 
<br>which Brazil maintains good-to-excellent relations. (Note: A 
<br>list of the accords examined is at para 21. End note.) 
<br>
<br>¶4. (U) These accords can be divided broadly into three 
<br>categories areas: 
<br>
<br>-- Cooperation accords to prevent use of and to combat 
<br>illegal drugs and psychotropic substances; 
<br>-- Accords that have an explicit or implicit counternarcotics 
<br>component, but are not exclusively focused on them; and 
<br>-- Accords to create permanent bilateral joint committees on 
<br>variety of topics, some of which have been created to 
<br>coordinate counternarcotics policies and actions. 
<br>
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br>Category 1: Counternarcotics accords 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (U) In general, these accords tend to contain components 
<br>found throughout all agreements and almost invariably are 
<br>motivated by the parties, recognition that the "illegal 
<br>traffic of narcotics represents a grave threat to the health 
<br>and well-being of populations as well as a problem that 
<br>
<br>BRASILIA 00000757 002 OF 007 
<br>
<br>
<br>affects their political, economic, social, and cultural 
<br>structures of Brazil and its bilateral partners." The 
<br>accords with Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, and 
<br>countries outside the region, such as Spain, Lebanon, and 
<br>Mexico share much of the same language. In the accords, the 
<br>parties generally are called to: 
<br>
<br>-- Exchange police and judicial information about persons 
<br>involved in the production and trafficking of illegal 
<br>narcotics, as well as illicit activities tied drug 
<br>trafficking; 
<br>-- Coordinate strategies for the prevention of use of illegal 
<br>drugs, for the rehabilitation of addicts, for the control of 
<br>precursor substances use to produce illegal narcotics, and 
<br>for the combat of drug trafficking. 
<br>-- Establish technical and scientific cooperation to identify 
<br>and intensify measures to detect, control, and eradicate 
<br>plantations for the production of illegal drugs; 
<br>-- Exchange information on legislation in the area of illegal 
<br>narcotics, psychotropic substances, and precursors and 
<br>chemicals used in the production of illegal drugs; 
<br>-- Exchange information on imports and exports of precursor 
<br>chemicals that could be used in the production of illegal 
<br>drugs 
<br>
<br>¶6. (U) Other accords have additional levels of specificity. 
<br>For example, Brazil,s 1999 accord with Spain has provisions 
<br>for exchange of information on rehabilitation programs; 
<br>exchange of information on transportation, cargo, mail, and 
<br>other means used to transport illegal drugs, as well as on 
<br>routes; and exchange of personnel to improve information flow 
<br>and enhance expertise. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (U) In most cases, exchanges are to be led by each 
<br>country,s respective foreign relations ministry--in the case 
<br>of Brazil, the Ministry of External Relations 
<br>(Itamaraty)--and are conducted on an ad-hoc basis at the 
<br>request of either of the parties to the accord. In some 
<br>cases, implementation of the accords are to be carried out by 
<br>comistas, (see more below) and on a few occasions the 
<br>comistas, are to be presided by Itamaraty jointly with the 
<br>National Anti-Drug Secretariat (SENAD), which is run of the 
<br>Office of the Presidency,s Cabinet for Institutional 
<br>Security (GSI). 
<br>
<br>¶8. (U) In the case of Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay, 
<br>Brazil has signed amendments to the accords that provide for 
<br>cooperation between the parties specifically in border 
<br>regions. Under these amendments, both parties agree to 
<br>develop coordinated strategies for the prevention of illegal 
<br>drug use and for rehabilitation of drug users in cities along 
<br>their shared borders. Implementation of these amendments 
<br>tends to be delegated to SENAD. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (U) Some accords, but not all, have provisions requiring 
<br>information shared under the authority of the accord to be 
<br>kept confidential according to each country,s laws and to 
<br>only be used for the purposes outlined in the accord. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br>Category 1: Exceptions in the case of source countries 
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶10. (U) Source countries, such as Bolivia and Colombia, tend 
<br>to break the pattern, and have more detailed agreements that 
<br>mandate each country,s main counternarcotics authority as 
<br>the principal go-between in the implementation of the 
<br>accords, instead of each country,s foreign ministry. This 
<br>deviation from the norm in the 1999 accords with both 
<br>Colombia and Bolivia is justified by the need for direct 
<br>communications between counterdrug authorities, instead of 
<br>through the foreign ministries, in order to make 
<br>
<br>BRASILIA 00000757 003.2 OF 007 
<br>
<br>
<br>&cooperation more efficient8. In the case of the Colombia 
<br>accord, implementation of the accord on the Brazilian side is 
<br>delegated to the Ministry of Justice and in the case of the 
<br>accord with Bolivia to both the Ministry of Justice and 
<br>SENAD. The accords with Colombia and Bolivia also include a 
<br>more extensive set of areas in which the two countries pledge 
<br>to work together. Both in the case of Colombia and Bolivia, 
<br>the countries pledge to share information on where precursors 
<br>are grown, to jointly establish lists of precursors and 
<br>chemicals substances, and to put into place a more extensive 
<br>and rigorous system of controls on the legal and illegal 
<br>movement of these precursors across their borders. Some of 
<br>these provisions include: 
<br>
<br>-- Both parties will cooperate to ensure the control and 
<br>oversight of commercial, customs, and distribution operations 
<br>of precursors and chemical substances included in the list of 
<br>substances and will share information on operations suspected 
<br>of involvement in illegal use of such substances; 
<br>-- Both parties will ensure that all import, export, 
<br>re-exportation, transit, and distribution of precursors will 
<br>have all relevant documentation; 
<br>-- In the case of suspected illicit activity, both parties 
<br>will share information on the type of precursor or chemical 
<br>substance, name, address, telephone and fax, and clients of 
<br>the vendor of the substances; will share information on 
<br>routes vendors reported they will use; statistical data 
<br>related to the supply and demand of precursors and chemical 
<br>substances in each country; 
<br>-- Requires the central authority in each country, upon being 
<br>provided with a request based on credible information from 
<br>the other party, to investigate either recipient of the 
<br>precursors or chemical substances; 
<br>-- The central authority of one of the parties can request 
<br>from the other party information on the individuals or 
<br>organizations that carry out the sale, importation, 
<br>exportation, re-exportation, distribution, transportation or 
<br>storage in order to initiate investigations. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
<br>Category 2: Accords related to, but not exclusively 
<br>drug-focused 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
<br>
<br>¶11. (U) Brazil has also signed more general accords that 
<br>impact Brazil,s ability to effectively counter the 
<br>trafficking of illegal drugs, although these are not 
<br>exclusively drug-focused. 
<br>
<br>TRANSNATIONAL CRIME 
<br>
<br>¶12. (U) For example, a type of accord that Brazil has signed, 
<br>although infrequently, is police cooperation accords focused 
<br>on transnational criminal activity. In 2005, Brazil and 
<br>Colombia agreed to one, although it has yet to be ratified in 
<br>Brazil. The agreement recognizes the threats to regional 
<br>stability and security posed by drug and arms trafficking and 
<br>money laundering and the relevance of law enforcement 
<br>cooperation to maintain internal security and effectively 
<br>combat organized transnational criminal activity. The 
<br>agreement calls for cooperation in the following areas: 
<br>
<br>-- Drug trafficking; 
<br>-- Arms trafficking; 
<br>-- Trafficking in persons; 
<br>-- Child sexual exploitation; 
<br>-- Environment crimes; 
<br>-- Money laundering; 
<br>-- Contraband; 
<br>-- Counterfeiting 
<br>-- Intellectual property 
<br>-- Cybercrimes 
<br>
<br>BRASILIA 00000757 004 OF 007 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶13. (U) Under the accord, the parties agree to share 
<br>intelligence information related to the crimes outlined 
<br>above, share database information, and undertake joint 
<br>operations. In addition, the accord calls for cooperation 
<br>and &sharing of experiences8 in the area of public 
<br>security, particularly in the areas of community policing, 
<br>security at sporting events, protection of visiting 
<br>dignitaries, kidnapping prevention, public order, and 
<br>protection of civil and human rights, among others. The 
<br>agreement also calls for the creation of Bilateral Working 
<br>Group on Police Matters (GTBP) to be run on the Brazilian 
<br>side by the Ministry of Justice and the Brazilian Federal 
<br>Police (DPF) that will meet annually, or more frequently on 
<br>an extraordinary basis, and will develop a joint action plan 
<br>to implement the accord. Finally, the accord calls for the 
<br>police chiefs of the border areas to meet at least every two 
<br>months for the purpose of evaluating the progress of the 
<br>accord and making any necessary adjustments to its 
<br>implementation. 
<br>
<br>CONTROL OF AIRSPACE 
<br>
<br>¶14. (U) Brazil has signed accords related to the control and 
<br>combat the transit of aircraft involved in illicit activity 
<br>with several countries, including Argentina, Colombia, 
<br>Paraguay, and Uruguay. These types of accords generally call 
<br>for the combating of the transit of irregular aircraft 
<br>through the parties, territory, implementation of an 
<br>information exchange system, technical and operational 
<br>training, and regular evaluations of the efficiency of the 
<br>programs. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- - 
<br>Category 3: Comista,, or joint permanent committee 
<br>--------------------------------------------- - 
<br>
<br>¶15. (U) The third category of accords Brazil has signed 
<br>involve the establishment of joint permanent committees or 
<br>'comistas,. Brazil has signed agreements to create these 
<br>bodies with about 40 countries, including most, but not all, 
<br>South American countries, and with countries in every region 
<br>of the world, to include Canada, South Korea, China, Iran, 
<br>Egypt, France, India, Japan, Nigeria. Brazil has sometimes 
<br>signed accords to establish a single comista, focused on 
<br>multiple themes, with various subcomistas established to deal 
<br>with more specific subjects. For example, the Bolivian 
<br>comista, has a subcomittee on counternarcotics issues. 
<br>Brazil has also created single-issue comistas,. For 
<br>example, the counternarcotics accords Brazil signed with 
<br>Mexico, Paraguay, Spain, Venezuela, Peru all provide for the 
<br>creation of a comista, focused exclusively on 
<br>counternarcotics. 
<br>
<br>¶16. (U) These single-issue comistas, are generally 
<br>established to implement the bilateral counternarcotics 
<br>accords, and are empowered to come up with recommendations of 
<br>measures to implement the accords, as well as evaluate the 
<br>effectiveness of the measures undertaking by each country to 
<br>implement the accords. They are also, for the most part, 
<br>presided by the ministries of foreign relations of each 
<br>country and are supposed to meet at least once a year, 
<br>alternating hosting duties. They can also meet more 
<br>frequently on an extraordinary basis, but not without at 
<br>least two months notice. Some comistas, can also 
<br>establish &working groups8 and others can establish 
<br>&subcommittees8 that can meet more frequently and focus on 
<br>specific areas. The Brazil-Paraguayan comista,, uniquely, 
<br>can create either or both sub-mechanisms. 
<br>
<br>¶17. (U) There are exceptions to the rule that comistas, 
<br>are presided by the respective foreign ministries. The 
<br>
<br>BRASILIA 00000757 005 OF 007 
<br>
<br>
<br>Brazil-Mexico comista', on the Brazilian side is hosted 
<br>jointly by Itamaraty with the Brazilian Federal Police; and 
<br>both the Brazil-Peru and Brazil-Spain comistas, are 
<br>presided on the Brazilian side by both Itamaraty and SENAD. 
<br>
<br>--------- 
<br>Comment: 
<br>--------- 
<br>
<br>¶18. (C) Itamaraty has a robust multi-layered diplomatic 
<br>framework that enables Brazil to work bilaterally with 
<br>countries both in the region and outside of it. Although it 
<br>is hard to gage how effective these accords are at enhancing 
<br>the effectiveness of counternarcotics cooperation, at a 
<br>minimum the accords serve to establish counternarcotics 
<br>cooperation as an important and priority goal for both 
<br>countries. As seen by the variations found within the 
<br>accords, Brazil also has shown that it is willing and capable 
<br>of maintaining a flexible approach that adapts itself to the 
<br>circumstances each country presents. Itamaraty has ceded the 
<br>leading role to other agencies in some cases, such as with 
<br>Bolivia and Colombia, and has shared the lead in others with 
<br>the Presidency through SENAD. Although the existence of such 
<br>arrangements could be exploited as a means of moving forward 
<br>with a bilateral accord, it is not clear why they were made 
<br>or that the GOB would consider them as the basis for a 
<br>similar bilateral arrangement with the United States. 
<br>
<br>¶19. (C) With regard to South American regional initiatives, 
<br>these bilateral accords suggest the scope of activities that 
<br>might be broadly acceptable within the region. However, 
<br>three notes of caution: first, it is important to note that 
<br>GOB officials are often unwilling to cooperate in broader 
<br>fora on matters that they consider to be of strictly 
<br>bilateral interest (e.g., border controls). Second, by 
<br>defining problems narrowly, policymakers often reject 
<br>potential areas for cooperation as not being of legitimate 
<br>interest to other countries. For example, Brazilian 
<br>policymakers tend to minimize the legitimacy of U.S. interest 
<br>in drug trafficking through Brazil by noting that the drugs 
<br>are destined for Europe and Africa. Third, senior GOB 
<br>officials tend to address drug trafficking in a reactive 
<br>manner, rather than with a goal of putting a halt to emerging 
<br>trends. They have rebuffed some proposals to cooperate in 
<br>targeting drug traffickers by dismissing the regionalization 
<br>of criminal gangs and questioning evidence suggesting the 
<br>spread of Mexican and Colombian drug cartels into other South 
<br>American countries. 
<br>
<br>¶20. (C) Finally, Itamaraty does not enter into agreements 
<br>with the United States without considering their broader 
<br>significance for the bilateral relationship, for Brazil,s 
<br>leadership in the region, and for Brazil,s global standing. 
<br>The GOB has been most willing to engage with us in areas that 
<br>appear to confirm Brazilian equality with the United States 
<br>(e.g., in trilateral cooperation), while resisting 
<br>cooperation with us in areas where the United States will be, 
<br>or will be seen to be, the dominant partner. Within that 
<br>framework, Brazil has been willing to cooperate with us in 
<br>global fora and in joint activities with extra-regional 
<br>developing countries, but has steadfastly resisted 
<br>cooperating with the United States within South America or in 
<br>South American regional fora. End comment.
