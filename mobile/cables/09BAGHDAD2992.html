<br>SUBJECT: IRAN'S EFFORTS IN IRAQI ELECTORAL POLITICS 
<br> 
<br>REF: BAGHDAD 2288 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Political M/C Gary A. Grappo for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (S) SUMMARY: Iran is a dominant player in Iraq's 
<br>electoral politics, and is using its close ties to Shia, 
<br>Kurdish, and select Sunni figures to shape the political 
<br>landscape in favor of a united Shia victory in the January 
<br>election.  A pro-Iran, Shia-dominated, and preferably 
<br>Islamist government, led by a united Shia alliance remains 
<br>Iran's top priority.  Toward that end, Iran is seeking to 
<br>increase pressure on Maliki to join forces with the other 
<br>prominent Shia coalition (Iraqi National Alliance) led by the 
<br>Sadrists and the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq (ISCI).  END 
<br>SUMMARY 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S) Iran is arguably the most influential regional power 
<br>seeking to shape and influence the outcome of Iraq's 
<br>election.  This message offers an assessment of Iran's 
<br>efforts to shape Iraq's electoral politics in anticipation of 
<br>the national election in January. 
<br> 
<br>Iran's Policy Goals and Tools 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (S) Iran's over-arching political objective for Iraq's 
<br>January election is the re-election of a Shia-dominated, 
<br>preferably Islamist, coalition led by Tehran's closest 
<br>allies, notably ISCI and the Sadrist Trend under the rubric 
<br>of the Iraqi National Alliance coalition (INA) (reftel). 
<br>Iraq, given its proximity to Iran and its shared Shia 
<br>heritage, represents a vital foreign policy priority for the 
<br>Iranian government's (IRIG) efforts to project its ideology 
<br>and influence in the region.  An economically dependent and 
<br>politically subservient Iraq would foster greater strategic 
<br>depth for Tehran. Iranian president Ahmadinejad has referred 
<br>to Iraq in recent press statements as "a Shia base" 
<br>confronting the broader menace perpetrated by those opposed 
<br>to Iraq's identity and stability (i.e., Sunni states, the 
<br>West). 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (S) Iran's approach to its bilateral relationship with 
<br>Iraq ranges from political micro-management to broad 
<br>strategic guidance emanating directly from Supreme Leader 
<br>Khamenei in Tehran. The IRIG recognizes that influence in 
<br>Iraq requires operational (and at times ideological) 
<br>flexibility.  As a result, it is not uncommon for the IRIG to 
<br>finance and support competing Shia, Kurdish, and to some 
<br>extent, Sunni entities, with the aim of developing the Iraqi 
<br>body politic's dependency on Tehran's largesse.  While exact 
<br>figures are unknown, Tehran's financial assistance to Iraqi 
<br>surrogates is estimated at USD 100-200 million  annually, 
<br>with USD 70 million going to ISCI/Badr coffers. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (S) Since at least 2003, Brigadier General Qasem 
<br>Soleimani, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards 
<br>Corps-Qods Force (IRGC-QF), has been the point main directing 
<br>the formulation and implementation of the IRIG's Iraq policy, 
<br>with authority second only to Supreme Leader Khamenei. 
<br>Through his IRGC-QF officers and Iraqi proxies in Iraq, 
<br>notably Iranian Ambassador and IRGC-QF associate Hassan 
<br>Kazemi-Qomi, Soleimani employs the full range of diplomatic, 
<br>security, intelligence, and economic tools to influence Iraqi 
<br>allies and detractors in order to shape a more pro-Iran 
<br>regime in Baghdad and the provinces. 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (S) Soleimani enjoys long-standing close ties with 
<br>several prominent GOI officials, including President 
<br>Talabani, Vice-President Adel Abdal-Mahdi (ISCI), Prime 
<br>Minister Maliki (Da'wa), former PM Jaafari, and more 
<br>recently, Speaker Samarra'i (Septel reports Iranian Speaker 
<br>Qrecently, Speaker Samarra'i (Septel reports Iranian Speaker 
<br>Larijani's November 4-7 visit to Iraq at Samarra'i's 
<br>invitation.).  Khamenei, President Ahmadinejad, Speaker 
<br>Larijani, and former president Rafsanjani consult regularly 
<br>with visiting GOI officials as part of the IRIG's broader 
<br>"strategic" council of advisers seeking to influence the GOI. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (S) Iran's tools of influence include financial support 
<br>to (and pressure on) a cross-spectrum of Iraqi parties and 
<br>officials; economic development assistance, notably to 
<br>religious organizations; lethal aid to select militant Shia 
<br>proxies; and sanctuary to Iraqi figures fearful of USG 
<br>targeting or those seeking to revitalize their 
<br>political/religious credentials, most notably Moqtada 
<br>al-Sadr.  This leverage also extends, to a lesser extent, to 
<br>select Sunni actors, including such public figures as Iraqi 
<br>Speaker Samarra'i, whose September visit to Tehran included 
<br> 
<br>BAGHDAD 00002992  002 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>meetings with several senior IRIG officials. 
<br> 
<br>Pre-Election Jockeying 
<br>---------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (S) Predictably, Iran is actively lobbying and recruiting 
<br>Iraqis of various political stripes and affiliations, 
<br>including Sunnis, in the run-up to the election to ensure a 
<br>united Shia-led coalition government.  Given the likelihood 
<br>of a Shia-led victory in the election, Iran appears more 
<br>concerned about the strength of a united Shia bloc in the 
<br>post-election phase of government formation.  For Iran, a 
<br>"rebellious" Maliki pursuing a more nationalist vs. sectarian 
<br>agenda risks splitting the Shia vote, which in turn weakens 
<br>the Shia political bloc's negotiating strength during the 
<br>government formation period post-election.  Iran's greatest 
<br>fear for the upcoming election is a fractured Shia coalition 
<br>that is unable to coalesce and thereby dominate the next 
<br>government.  Iran's worst-case election scenario 
<br>(increasingly unrealistic) is a coup d'etat of former regime 
<br>elements hostile to Tehran. 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (S) A weak Shia coalition before or after the election 
<br>would further undermine the INA and their pro-Iranian 
<br>entities, notably ISCI and the Sadrist Trend.  The Kurds, 
<br>historically closer to ISCI, remain the important swing vote 
<br>and are unlikely to reveal their true coalition intentions 
<br>until after the election.  As seasoned masters of the Iraqi 
<br>political chessboard, Kurdish leaders such as Talabani and 
<br>Barzani will likely exploit their political strength among 
<br>Shia/Sunni counterparts to protect and expand Kurdish 
<br>influence in a future government. Iran's historic ties to the 
<br>PUK, and to a lesser extent KDP officials, make the Kurds an 
<br>important element in ensuring a pro-Iranian Shia victory in 
<br>the election.  INA officials are confident that the Kurds 
<br>will join their coalition, all but guaranteeing an election 
<br>victory.  An unknown factor in national elections is the 
<br>Kurdish opposition party, Goran List, under the leadership of 
<br>former PUK Secretary General Nawshirwan Mustafa.  Goran is 
<br>committed to unseating the PUK (and Talabani) in Suleymaniyah 
<br>province but needs financial backing to ensure its long-term 
<br>viability in the KRG and national politics.  Iran could 
<br>conceivably alleviate Goran's financial woes, particularly 
<br>through its close ties with the Kurdish Jaff tribe, some of 
<br>whom are Goran members.  However, doing so would undermine 
<br>the IRIG's valued relationship with Talabani, while also 
<br>proving exceedingly duplicitous, even by IRIG and KRG 
<br>standards. 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (S) It is important to note that Iran's power in Iraq, 
<br>although extensive, is not without limitations.  The IRIG's 
<br>greatest political roadblock remains the domineering 
<br>authority and religious credibility embodied in Grand 
<br>Ayatollah Ali Sistani. Despite his Iranian heritage, Sistani 
<br>is Iraq's most revered Shia religious (and political) 
<br>authority.  A critic of Iran's "Velayet-e-Faqih" (rule of the 
<br>jurisprudent) system of theocratic governance, Sistani's 
<br>abstemious (aka Quietest school) approach to Shia politics 
<br>has kept him well above the political fray while at the same 
<br>time ensuring him significant impact on those rare occasions 
<br>when he pronounces on politics.  For example, Sistani's 
<br>public support for an open list ballot was instrumental in 
<br>prompting ISCI, Sadrist Trend, Maliki's State of Law, and 
<br>other Shia parties to follow suit, despite Tehran's 
<br>preference for a closed list.  Domestic political realities 
<br>will continue to force Shia political parties like ISCI, Dawa 
<br>Qwill continue to force Shia political parties like ISCI, Dawa 
<br>and Sadr Trend, with close historic ties to Iran, to balance 
<br>between support for a broader Iraqi-Shia agenda, as 
<br>championed by Sistani, and the alternative, championed by 
<br>Iran, that would subordinate Iraqi interests to Iran's 
<br>broader objectives (septel). 
<br> 
<br>Soft vs. Hard Power 
<br>------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶11.  (S) Following the GOI's crackdown on Iranian-supported 
<br>Sadrist militias in Basrah during the "Charge of the Knights" 
<br>operation in March 2008, Iran has calibrated its operations 
<br>in Iraq to encompass more "soft power" (economic, religious, 
<br>educational) support and investment as part of a broader 
<br>"hearts and minds" campaign. (NOTE: Iranian lethal aid to 
<br>militant proxies continues; however, on a less visible scale. 
<br> END NOTE).  With annual bilateral trade estimated at USD 4 
<br>billion (up 30 percent since 2008) and comprised mostly of 
<br>Iranian imports (approximately 48 percent of Iraq's imports 
<br>are Iranian goods), the IRIG continues to jockey for economic 
<br>domination in Iraq through targeted development assistance, 
<br>focused largely on refurbishment of Shia religious shrines, 
<br> 
<br>BAGHDAD 00002992  003 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>and trade deals and bilateral agreements aimed at fostering 
<br>greater Iraqi economic dependency on Iran.  This measure has 
<br>been successful, largely because of Iran's geographic 
<br>proximity and access to Iraqi markets that are otherwise 
<br>financially or politically less appealing to other states, 
<br>notably the United States, Europe, and other industrialized 
<br>nations.  Turkey, on the other hand, remains Iran's biggest 
<br>economic competitor, particularly in the Kurdistan Regional 
<br>Government (KRG). 
<br> 
<br>Implications for U.S. Policy 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶12.  (S) COMMENT:  Concerns about long-term U.S. influence, 
<br>albeit tempered by the withdrawal deadline, continue to 
<br>inform IRIG decision-making to ensure its strategic foothold 
<br>in Iraq.  Iran views Iraq as a natural (and more junior) 
<br>strategic partner.  As a result, Iran will continue to flex 
<br>its muscles to ensure it's strategic outcomes are met.  This 
<br>should not lead to alarmist tendencies or reactions on our 
<br>part.  The next Iraqi government will continue to cultivate 
<br>close ties with Iran given long-standing historical realities 
<br>that precede Iraq's ties with the United States.  On the 
<br>other hand, Iran's influence in Iraq should not be 
<br>overestimated.  As the GOI continues to gain its footing, 
<br>points of divergence between Tehran and Baghdad become 
<br>increasingly evident on such sensitive bilateral issues as 
<br>water, hydrocarbons, maritime borders, and political parity. 
<br>Some prominent Iraqi leaders, including those with close ties 
<br>to Iran (i.e., Maliki, Ammar al-Hakim) are increasingly 
<br>sensitive to being labeled Iranian lackeys. 
<br> 
<br>¶13.  (S)  COMMENT CONT'D:  Our objective in Iraq should be 
<br>less about countering all-things Iranian, and more about 
<br>developing viable alternatives and approaches that gradually 
<br>alter the GOI's political, economic, and social worldview. 
<br>Development of viable international alternatives in Iraq is 
<br>one of the most effective measures of countering Iranian 
<br>ambitions and, ultimately, integrating Iraq as a constructive 
<br>member of the international community.  Specifically, our 
<br>ongoing efforts to bolster the GOI through capacity-building 
<br>and assistance within the Strategic Framework Agreement (SFA) 
<br>and to remove Iraq from Chapter VII remain our most valuable 
<br>tools in this regard. Given the value placed on the SFA by 
<br>the GOI and the Iraqi public, our ability to recognize, 
<br>enhance, and exploit the value of the partnership will 
<br>constitute an essential element of any effort to counter 
<br>"malign" Iranian influence.
