<br>SUBJECT: FOREIGN SECRETARY MILIBAND SUBMITS RENDITION 
<br>STATEMENT TO PARLIAMENT 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Richard LeBaron for 
<br>reasons 1.4 (b,d) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) Foreign Office Director for Defence and Strategic 
<br>Threats Simon Manley informed Poloff July 2 that the Foreign 
<br>Office would submit Foreign Secretary Miliband's written 
<br>statement on rendition to Parliament July 2, for entry into 
<br>Parliamentary records July 3. Manley said the statement (see 
<br>Para 2) had been cleared by "State and (GPRO)." There are no 
<br>plans for an oral statement, but questions from MP's are 
<br>likely over the next week and the statement will likely 
<br>attract considerable press attention as well as skepticism 
<br>from NGOs and op-ed writers.

<br>FS Miliband's Written Statement on Rendition 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) Begin Statement: Terrorist Suspects (Rendition) 
<br>
<br>On 21 February I made a statement to the House regarding new 
<br>information we had been passed by the US Government regarding 
<br>rendition. Contrary to earlier assurances that Diego Garcia 
<br>had not been used for rendition flights, US investigations 
<br>had revealed two occasions, both in 2002, when this had in 
<br>fact occurred. Since February, I have corresponded with 
<br>Secretary Rice on this issue and our officials have continued 
<br>to work through the details and implications of the new 
<br>information. 
<br>
<br>I promised the House that, as part of this of this (sic) 
<br>process, my officials would compile a list of flights where 
<br>we had been alerted to concern about rendition through the UK 
<br>or our Overseas Territories. The list which they have 
<br>compiled, containing 391 flights, reflects concerns put to us 
<br>by hon. Members, members of the public, multilateral 
<br>organisations and non-governmental organisations. Inclusion 
<br>on this list does not represent an official endorsement of 
<br>any allegations about a particular flight. On the contrary, 
<br>US government flights as with other government flights occur 
<br>regularly for a variety of purposes. Our intention was to 
<br>collate in one place those concerns that had been put to us 
<br>directly. The list was passed to the US on 15 May. I 
<br>undertook in February to publish the list and have today 
<br>placed a copy in the library of the House and published it on 
<br>the FCO website (www.fco.gov.uk). 
<br>
<br>The United States Government received the list of flights 
<br>from the UK Government. The United States Government 
<br>confirmed that, with the exception of two cases related to 
<br>Diego Garcia in 2002, there have been no other instances in 
<br>which US intelligence flights landed in the United Kingdom, 
<br>its Overseas Territories, or the Crown Dependencies, with a 
<br>detainee on board since September 11, 2001. 
<br>
<br>Our US allies are agreed on the need to seek our permission 
<br>for any future renditions through UK territory. Secretary 
<br>Rice has underlined to me the firm US understanding that 
<br>there will be no rendition through the UK, our Overseas 
<br>Territories and Crown Dependencies, with a detainee on board 
<br>since September 11, 2001. 
<br>
<br>Our US Allies are agreed on the need to seek our permission 
<br>for any future renditions through UK territory. Secretary 
<br>Rice has underlined to me the firm US understanding that 
<br>there will be no rendition through the UK, our Overseas 
<br>Territories and Crown Dependencies or Airspace without first 
<br>receiving our express permission. We have made clear that we 
<br>would only grant such permission if we were satisfied that 
<br>the rendition would accord with UK law and our international 
<br>obligations. The circumstances of any such request would be 
<br>carefully examined on a case-by-case basis. 
<br>
<br>Our intelligence and counter-terrorism relationship with the 
<br>US is vital to the national security of the United Kingdom. 
<br>There must and will continue to be the strongest possible 
<br>intelligence and counter-terrorism relationship between our 
<br>two countries, consistent with UK law and our international 
<br>obligations. (End Text)
