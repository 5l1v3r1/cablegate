<br>
<br>REF: RABAT 0988 
<br>
<br>RABAT 00001009 001.2 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>Classified By: Charge d'Affaires, a.i., Robert P. Jackson for reasons 1 
<br>.4 (b) and (d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) Summary: Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs Chief 
<br>of Staff and Director General of Multilateral Relations 
<br>Nasser Bourita told the Charge on December 28 that the health 
<br>of wounded Guinean junta leader Captain Moussa Dadis Camara 
<br>has improved and that he has sought to leave Morocco. 
<br>Bourita reiterated that Dadis Camara arrived without prior 
<br>consultation with the GOM, but he was allowed into Morocco 
<br>for treatment of his wounds. Charge noted that Guinea seems 
<br>to have become calmer in Camara's absence and stressed that 
<br>it would be helpful if he were to remain out of the country. 
<br>Bourita stated that the GOM shared U.S. concerns about the 
<br>stability of Guinea and the region and wished to help find a 
<br>solution, but he added that there are no grounds upon which 
<br>to keep Camara any longer. He urged the U.S. and France to 
<br>avoid making any public request that Morocco keep Dadis 
<br>Camara. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) In a meeting on December 28, Moroccan MFA Chief of 
<br>Staff Nasser Bourita told Charge and A/PolCouns that Dadis 
<br>Camara had wanted to leave Morocco last week but that the GOM 
<br>decided to keep him here until the end of the month for 
<br>continuing medical treatment. He added that Guinean Minister 
<br>of National Defense Sekouba Konate is due to arrive about 
<br>20:30 GMT on December 28 to visit Dadis, who is still the 
<br>leader of Guinea. Bourita suggested that Konate was not 
<br>preparing to take over that role. Konate has wanted to see 
<br>Dadis for some time, presumably to make his own assessment of 
<br>Dadis, health. XXXXXXXXXXXX  corroborates that a plane carrying Konate has left Conakry. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) In explaining the GOM's desire to help find a 
<br>peaceful solution to the problems in Guinea, Bourita said 
<br>Morocco's relations with Guinea and other countries must be 
<br>taken into consideration. It is not for Morocco, he said, to 
<br>turn Dadis Camara over to the ICC. He added that were a 
<br>Security Council resolution forthcoming, it would put the GOM 
<br>in a difficult position but would, of course, be binding. 
<br>Bourita asked rhetorically whether "out of Guinea" meant "in 
<br>Morocco" or that Morocco should help find a third-country 
<br>location for Dadis Camara. Bourita stressed that the U.S. 
<br>and France should avoid any public request for Morocco to 
<br>keep Dadis. Bourita further urged that the U.S. and France 
<br>should maintain contact with Foreign Minister Taieb Fassi 
<br>Fihri while the Minister is in Tripoli, Libya, for the Arab 
<br>Maghreb Union Ministerial, December 28 to 30. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Echoing comments made to A/PolCouns several weeks ago 
<br>by the MFA Director of African Affairs, Bourita went on to 
<br>say that it would be better to find a way to deal with Dadis 
<br>Camara in Guinea. He noted that Dadis still enjoyed 
<br>considerable support in the country and stressed the need to 
<br>keep Dadis calm and confident about his future. To do 
<br>otherwise, he said, risked more violence and more bloodshed. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) XXXXXXXXXXXX  declared that Dadis'  return to Guinea would lead to significant problems. He said  he learned from doctors attending to Dadis that he was doing  quite well, and he confirmed that Konate was on his way to  Rabat to meet with the junta leader and perhaps return with  him to Guinea. XXXXXXXXXXXX  said he had contacted General Mamadouba  Toto Camara in Conakry and was told Dadis' imminent return to  Guinea "was a lie." 
<br>
<br>
<br>RABAT 00001009 002.2 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Comment: While we understand both from Bourita and 
<br>from French Ambassador Joubert that French President Sarkozy 
<br>planned to discuss Guinea with King Mohammed VI during their 
<br>&family dinner8 on December 27, there do not appear to have 
<br>been any breakthroughs. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S/NF) We believe Bourita is sincere in expressing the 
<br>GOM's desire to help Guinea. However, with no legal or 
<br>medical basis to keep Dadis here and without any country 
<br>other than Libya prepared to accept him on a legal or medical 
<br>basis, Bourita's suggestion that Dadis be dealt with in 
<br>Guinea may be the only viable option. End Comment. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (U) Tripoli minimize considered.
