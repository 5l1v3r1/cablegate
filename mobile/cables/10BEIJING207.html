<br>Classified By: DCM Robert Goldberg.  Reasons 1.4 (b), (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) Summary:  A well-placed contact claims that the
<br>Chinese government coordinated the recent intrusions of
<br>Google systems.  According to our contact, the closely held
<br>operations were directed at the Politburo Standing Committee
<br>level.
<br>
<br>-- Another contact claimed a top PRC leader was actively
<br>working with Google competitor Baidu against Google.
<br>
<br>-- Chinese concerns over the recent Google threat to take
<br>down the company's Chinese-language search engine google.cn
<br>over censorship and hacking allegations were focused on the
<br>service's growing popularity among Chinese Internet users and
<br>a perception that the USG and Google were working in concert.
<br>
<br>-- An appeal to nationalism seems to be the Chinese
<br>government's chosen option to counter Google's demand to
<br>provide unfiltered web content.
<br>
<br>-- Contacts in the technology industry tell us that Chinese
<br>interference in the operations of foreign businesses is
<br>widespread and often underreported to U.S. parent companies.
<br>End Summary.
<br>
<br>Attacks Directed at High Level
<br>------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>
<br>PRC Sees USG and Google Working Together
<br>----------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX told PolOff XXXXXXXXXXXX that
<br>Google's recent move presented a major dilemma (maodun) for
<br>the Chinese government, not because of the cyber-security
<br>aspect but because of Google's direct challenge to China's
<br>legal restrictions on Internet content.  The immediate
<br>strategy, XXXXXXXXXXXX said, seemed to be to appeal to Chinese
<br>nationalism by accusing Google and the U.S. government of
<br>working together to force China to accept "Western values"
<br>and undermine China's rule of law.  The problem the censors
<br>were facing, however, was that Google's demand to deliver
<br>uncensored search results was very difficult to spin as an
<br>attack on China, and the entire episode had made Google more
<br>interesting and attractive to Chinese Internet users.  All of
<br>a sudden, XXXXXXXXXXXX continued, Baidu looked like a boring
<br>state-owned enterprise while Google "seems very attractive,
<br>like the forbidden fruit."  He said it "seems clear" to the
<br>Chinese people that Google and the U.S. government were
<br>working together on Internet freedom and to undermine Chinese
<br>government controls on the Internet.  That made some
<br>intellectuals happy, XXXXXXXXXXXX said, but "some others" regarded it
<br>as interference in China's internal affairs.
<br>
<br>Industry: Interference Common, Paranoia Driving PRC Policy
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------------
<br>
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX  002 OF 002
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX (please protect) noted the
<br>pronounced disconnect between views of U.S. parent companies
<br>and local subsidiaries.  PRC-based company officials often
<br>downplayed the extent of PRC government interference in their
<br>operations for fear of consequences for their local markets.
<br>Our contact emphasized that Google and other U.S. companies
<br>in China were struggling with the stated Chinese goal of
<br>technology transfer for the purpose of excluding foreign
<br>competition.  This consultant noted the Chinese were
<br>exploiting the global economic downturn to enact increasingly
<br>draconian product certification and government procurement
<br>regulations to force foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs) to
<br>transfer intellectual property and to carve away the market
<br>share of foreign companies.
<br>
<br>Chinese Media:  American Hypocrisy and Cultural Hegemony
<br>--------------------------------------------- -----------
<br>
<br>¶5. (U) The Secretary's speech continued to dominate headlines
<br>January 25-26, with the official People's Daily (circ 2.2
<br>million) alleging collusion between U.S. officials and the
<br>business community as evidenced by the propinquity of
<br>Google's rethink of its China business and the Secretary's
<br>speech.  Chinese media again accused the U.S. of "cultural
<br>hegemony" for setting the standards for "so-called Internet
<br>freedom8 and of hypocrisy for calling for the free flow of
<br>information while using the Internet as a political and
<br>military tool.  People's Daily-affiliated Global Times
<br>English (circ 150,000) called the speech a "milestone"
<br>showing that U.S. and Western political interests were
<br>"taking over every dimension" of cyberspace.
<br>
<br>¶6. (U) The Party-affiliated Beijing News (circ 530,000)
<br>opined that the speech showed "a huge gap between Chinese and
<br>American information industries, which may lead to a trade
<br>war strategy."  In an article headlined "China Intensifies
<br>Counterattack on Internet Accusation," Global Times Chinese
<br>(circ 1.3 million) quoted Chinese scholar Niu Xinchun as
<br>rejecting the theory that U.S.-China conflict would replace
<br>the "G2" cooperation model, noting that U.S. attacks usually
<br>ended "poorly" when the U.S. considered its practical
<br>interests.  Many papers quoted statements from the State
<br>Council Information Office and Ministry of Industry and
<br>Information Technology calling Chinese Internet controls
<br>"legitimate" and saying they should not be subject to
<br>"unjustifiable interference."  Papers continued to conflate
<br>Google's China business strategy with the Secretary's speech.
<br>
<br>Blogging Circumscribed
<br>----------------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) Anecdotally, censors appear to have cracked down on
<br>blogging about the Secretary's speech.  XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX  Secretary Clinton's speech is currently blocked
<br>in Chinese on state.gov but remains accessible on the U.S.
<br>Embassy website in both English and Chinese.
