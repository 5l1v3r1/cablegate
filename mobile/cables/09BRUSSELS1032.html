<br>SUBJECT: IN A REPEAT OF 2008, DIVISIONS EXIST BETWEEN EU
<br>MEMBER STATES ON CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY
<br>
<br>Classified By: Charge d'Affaires Peter Chase, Reasons: 1.4 (b) and (d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary. As it prepares for Copenhagen, the EU is
<br>reliving many of the arguments that plagued it during
<br>negotiations of the Climate and Energy Package last year. At
<br>a recent EU Energy and Environment Ministers meeting, Poland
<br>is leading what appears to be the same group of Central and
<br>Eastern European Member States in opposing the concept that
<br>they should pay for reducing carbon emissions in developing
<br>countries with much larger GDPs, notably China. Despite
<br>indications that internal questions had been settled, the
<br>economic recession is exacerbating the divisions among Member
<br>States. Additionally, in working toward the EU,s emissions
<br>reduction target, now 20% from 1990 levels in 2020 but with
<br>the possibility of going to 30% with "comparable" efforts
<br>from other developed countries, the EU has painted itself
<br>into a corner, both potentially forcing it to make
<br>increasingly painful reductions and making it next to
<br>impossible for the EU to commit to anything more than 30%.
<br>It will use its offer to go to 30% as a negotiating tactic so
<br>it can justify its actions to its citizens and its companies.
<br>End summary.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) During negotiations in 2008 on the EU,s Climate and
<br>Energy Package, Poland formed a coalition with eight other
<br>new Member States to gain concessions during the final
<br>drafting to account for emissions reductions during the 1990s
<br>and the possible threats to economic growth. Now, in
<br>debating how the EU will approach the UN climate change
<br>negotiations, Europe is seeing a repeat of the 2008
<br>divisions. A Finnish delegate indicated to USEU EconOff on
<br>the margins of the July 23-25 informal Energy and Climate
<br>Ministers meeting in Are, Sweden that the EU,s effort is
<br>suffering from a repeat of last year, and several Member
<br>States are very upset that the actions of some are "holding
<br>the EU hostage." Germany is concerned that a lack of
<br>internal solidarity is leading to problems with the EU,s
<br>position and leadership internationally. A German delegate
<br>stated that Poland,s argument thus far can be summed up to
<br>"give us two billion euros for technology."
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) The main issue is that some Member States have a
<br>problem with the increased burden placed upon them in
<br>addition to that of the Climate and Energy Package. A Polish
<br>delegate argued that the new Member States are at a
<br>disadvantage and to catch up with the rest of the EU, they
<br>will need to move faster than anyone globally, simply under
<br>the terms of the Climate and Energy Package. A Latvian
<br>delegate explained that even in Latvia, with its high
<br>proportion of renewable energy and its effort to move
<br>farther, it is not a wealthy country and should not be asked
<br>to pay for China and India. As a result, during the internal
<br>discussion on how to share the burden of EU mitigation and
<br>financing efforts, a Slovakian official explained that the
<br>coalition formed during the Climate and Energy Package is
<br>forming an alternative position to the major Western European
<br>Member States. According to the Polish delegate, this will
<br>allow a real discussion as to how to address historical
<br>responsibility, in which early efforts by the new Member
<br>States--beyond post-Soviet deindustrialization--can be taken
<br>into account. This will also allow Poland and others to
<br>defend their use of coal, expected to be for the long-term
<br>and not accepted by many in the EU, on energy security
<br>grounds.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Beyond the formation of the opposition bloc, few other
<br>decisions have been made, most notably on the move from 20%
<br>to 30%. Swedish Environment Minister Andreas Carlgren,
<br>supported by Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas, publicly
<br>stated in re that there is "broad agreement" in the EU to
<br>push towards an ambitious Copenhagen agreement that allows
<br>for the EU to move to 30%. However, internally, there are
<br>divisions, including how to define comparability. A
<br>Slovakian delegate argued that 20% is still the current
<br>formal position, and divisions remain as to if and how to
<br>move to 30% and under what conditions. A French delegate was
<br>more subtle and explained that moving from 20% to 30% is not
<br>a fundamental problem, but the EU will not make the decision
<br>until Copenhagen. By contrast, a Norwegian delegate
<br>explained that the EU has positioned itself politically based
<br>on the "inevitable" move to 30%, that it would be impossible
<br>to avoid its commitment to 30%. The EU will thus use 30% as
<br>a negotiating tactic to move others to stronger commitments,
<br>so that it can justify its own decision to move to 30% to its
<br>citizens and companies, who are arguing that the EU should
<br>not go farther until other developed countries follow.
<br>(Note: Norway, while not a member of the EU, is a part of the
<br>Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), and is thus privy to internal
<br>discussions. End note.)

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) The EU has made few other decisions related to
<br>financing. Poland and Latvia, among others, continue to
<br>argue that the GDP per capita of many Member States is less
<br>than that of China, and thus they should not be asked to pay.
<br>However, Western European Member States are more concerned
<br>at the moment as to how to develop a framework for financing.
<br>A German delegate explained that Germany would like the EU
<br>to be more concrete on a financing framework, but should not
<br>present a concrete number until much later. According to the
<br>delegate, this framework should be based on efforts by
<br>developing countries, a sentiment echoed by Carlgren when
<br>during a press conference, he repeated the EU mantra of "no
<br>money, no deal," adding to it "no actions, no money."
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Comment. Unsurprisingly, the EU remains undecided,
<br>and in some cases, divided, as to how it will approach the
<br>final months of the UN negotiations. The Swedish Presidency
<br>claims these issues will be worked out by the end of October,
<br>when Finance and Environment Ministers meet back to back in
<br>Brussels on October 20-21, followed by the European Coucil
<br>of Heads of State on October 29-30. It i likely that
<br>Poland, using its bloc of EasternMember States, will
<br>continue to press for conessions internally, much as it did
<br>during negotiations last year. While it is not yet clear how
<br>these internal debates will play out, it is likely some
<br>concessions will be made so the EU can present a unified
<br>position in the international negotiations. The EU is so
<br>concerned that it maintain its leadership position, it will
<br>likely work rapidly to address the concerns of these Member
<br>States, although doing so will either raise the pain for the
<br>Western EU members or dilute the EU,s claim to lead
<br>internationally. End comment.
