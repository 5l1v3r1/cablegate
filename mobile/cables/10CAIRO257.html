<br>SUBJECT: DASD Kahl Meeting with Egyptian Military Officials 
<br>
<br>CLASSIFIED BY: Donald A. Blome, Minister Counselor, DOS, ECPO; 
<br>REASON: 1.4(B), (D) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Key Points: 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>-- On January 31, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for the 
<br>Middle East Dr. Colin Kahl met with Major General Mohammad 
<br>al-Assar, Assistant to the Minister of Defense, Major General Ahmad 
<br>Moataz, Chief of the American Relations Branch, and Major General 
<br>Fouad Arafa, Consultant to the Military Intelligence Department. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>-- During the meeting, Kahl discussed the need to incorporate a 
<br>military strategy that included symmetrical and asymmetrical 
<br>capabilities, pursuing a capabilities-based approach to security 
<br>assistance, FMF issues, balance of power in the region, nuclear 
<br>weapons in the Middle East, current U.S. policy towards Iran, 
<br>Egyptian efforts to counter-smuggling and interdict illicit weapons 
<br>destined for Gaza, and the release of advanced weapons systems. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>-- The Egyptian defense officials continued to stress that the 
<br>threats facing the United States were different from Egypt's, and 
<br>Egypt needs to maintain a strong conventional military to counter 
<br>other armies in the region. 
<br>

<br>
<br>Egypt's Current Security Concerns and National Defense Policy 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---------------------- 
<br>--------------- 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) During the 31 January 2010 meeting, al-Assar 
<br>constantly referred to the numerous unstable security situations in 
<br>the Middle East that influenced Egyptian military doctrine to 
<br>include: Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon/Hezbollah, 
<br>Palestine/HAMAS, Yemen, Sudan/Darfur, Somalia, Eritrea, Piracy 
<br>issues, Algeria, and al-Qaida. Al-Assar emphasized that ethnic 
<br>conflict throughout the region and border issues could have a 
<br>negative impact on Egyptian sovereignty at any time. al-Assar 
<br>commented that he did not expect any of these security situations 
<br>to resolve in the near future; instead, he believed the list would 
<br>grow even larger. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) al-Assar outlined Egypt's National Defense Policy 
<br>which he stated was based on a defensive, capabilities-based 
<br>strategy instead of threat-based. The number one priority is the 
<br>defense of Egyptian land and the Suez Canal. Other goals include: 
<br>preparedness for unexpected threats such as terrorism; the 
<br>achievement of regional stability; interoperability with Egypt's 
<br>military partners; and a leading role for Egypt in the region. 
<br>Al-Assar provided the Egyptian military's list of regional 
<br>threats/concerns such as Nile Basin water rights and the conflicts 
<br>in Darfur and southern Sudan. He commented that one never knows 
<br>what Libya might do and that it was essential that Egypt maintain 
<br>the balance of power on its eastern border. He reiterated the fact 
<br>that Israel possesses unconventional weapons and sophisticated 
<br>conventional weapons, which creates a regional imbalance and 
<br>contributes to instability. He noted that stability in the region 
<br>cannot be attained without balance of power. He stated that the 
<br>Egyptian military doctrine did not intend to gain an edge on any 
<br>other country in the region or cause offense to anyone. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Al-Assar complained that the Egyptian military 
<br>sometimes felt pressured by the United States to reform its 
<br>doctrine and capabilities to counter asymmetric threats. He 
<br>emphasized that the threats faced by the United States were 
<br>different from Egypt's. He commented that tanks and aircraft were 
<br>necessary to fight asymmetrical threats as well. He referred to 
<br>General Patreaus' Sadr City battle plan against extremists and 
<br>noted that this plan depended on the use of tanks and aircraft in 
<br>Iraq. He called on Dr. Kahl to educate Congress about Egypt's 
<br>military needs and not put limits on the numbers of aircraft and 
<br>tanks. He noted that the Egyptian military preferred to purchase 
<br>
<br>its weapons and armaments from the United States, but that Egypt's 
<br>national security was a red line and they could go elsewhere if 
<br>they had to. 
<br>

<br>
<br>Security Assistance and Modernization 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Dr. Kahl commented that the U.S. military had learned 
<br>some hard lessons about the promises and limits of technology 
<br>during the first years of the war in Iraq. Kahl stated that there 
<br>are no longer any purely conventional military conflicts in the 
<br>world and the last large conventional war was the First Gulf War. 
<br>The current challenge for modern armies is to find the right 
<br>balance between conventional and irregular forces and doctrines to 
<br>fight what Secretary Gates refers to as "hybrid wars." Kahl 
<br>commented that the U.S. lost more tanks in Iraq to roadside bombs 
<br>than in battles with Iraqi tanks. He also noted that information 
<br>technology in the modern war was just as valuable as military 
<br>equipment in order to have the ability to rapidly communicate and 
<br>assess the environment. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Dr. Kahl reiterated that a modern military should rely 
<br>on quality equipment rather than a large quantity of outdated 
<br>armaments, and should place a greater emphasis on the scope of its 
<br>aggregate capabilities vice number of high-end weapons platforms. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Major General Fouad Arafa interjected during the 
<br>discussion to note that the spirit of the Camp David accord was 
<br>that there would be a 2:3 balance between Egypt and Israel's 
<br>security assistance. Egypt's role was to keep a certain balance of 
<br>power in the region that would not allow other parties to go to 
<br>war. Egypt had fulfilled this role faithfully for the last 30 
<br>years. al-Assar added that the current ratio of 2:5 was a 
<br>violation of the Camp David ratio. 
<br>

<br>Yemen, Iran, and the Weapons Free Zone 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------- 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) al-Assar noted that Iran effectively interfered in 
<br>the internal affairs of Lebanon, Palestine, and Iraq. He commented 
<br>that Iran's nuclear ambitions would significantly change the 
<br>balance of power in the region and was contributing to further 
<br>regional instability and intensifying the conflicts. Al-Assar 
<br>stated that Egypt views Iran as a threat to the region and its 
<br>conventional and unconventional weapons would only increase the 
<br>instability in the region. Al-Assar commented that if Iran was 
<br>successful in obtaining nuclear weapons, it would only encourage 
<br>other countries in the Middle East to pursue the same path. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Al-Assar brought up President Obama's pledge to 
<br>pursue a Nuclear Weapons Free Zone (NWFZ) in the Middle East. He 
<br>called on the United States to not ignore the Israeli nuclear 
<br>program. He stated that Israel's nuclear program only gave Iran 
<br>justification for creating its own nuclear weapons. If Iran 
<br>obtained nuclear weapons, it would only embolden Iran to use 
<br>Hezbollah and HAMAS with impunity. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Dr. Kahl stated that ultimate goal for the United States 
<br>was the creation of a NWFZ in the Middle East. However, it was not 
<br>possible to draw strict parallels between Iran's acquisition of 
<br>nuclear weapons and other Middle Eastern countries. Iran is the 
<br>
<br>only country in the world that was currently threatening to wipe an 
<br>entire country off the map, and Tehran reinforced this message 
<br>through destabilizing activities pursued by its proxies in the 
<br>region. The goal of a NWFZ in the Middle East could take 10-20 
<br>years to achieve; however, the international community could not 
<br>wait 20 years to address Iran's nuclear program and needed to 
<br>figure out ways to slow down the clock on the Iran's nuclear 
<br>ambitions. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Major General Fouad Arafa joined the conversation stating 
<br>that Iran was using the various Middle East conflicts for its own 
<br>ambitions and was gaining power because of its interference in the 
<br>internal affairs of the Middle Eastern countries. It was essential 
<br>to cut Iran's connections and influence in the regional conflicts 
<br>in Lebanon, Israel, and Palestine in order to decrease the level of 
<br>influence Iran enjoyed in the region. Iran was effectively using 
<br>Arab public opinion to advance its goals. Dr. Kahl agreed and 
<br>reinforced the need for continued Arab engagement on this issue to 
<br>ensure a "unified front" on the part of the international 
<br>community. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Kahl stated that the United States had reached out to 
<br>Iran in 2009 through unconditional talks and that this was meant as 
<br>a test of Iran's willingness to prove that its nuclear program was 
<br>for peaceful civilian use. Iran, however, had not seized this 
<br>opportunity to resolve international concerns. Kahl speculated 
<br>that European countries and even Russia, which would not have 
<br>supported the sanctions in the past, were now ready to increase 
<br>pressure on Iran. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>------------------------- 
<br>
<br>Counter-smuggling 
<br>
<br>------------------------- 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Dr. Kahl extended his appreciation for Egypt's enhanced 
<br>counter-smuggling efforts in the past year, but expressed concern 
<br>over recent increases in smuggling activity into the Gaza strip and 
<br>HAMAS' efforts to rearm. Dr. Kahl emphasized that the United 
<br>States understands that this is an especially sensitive political 
<br>issue internally in Egypt, as well as in the region. Dr. Kahl 
<br>noted that the United States was looking forward to the positive 
<br>completion of the BTADs project and thanked the Egyptian Military 
<br>for its agreement-in-principle to sign a follow -on statement for 
<br>future BTADs support as this provided an opportunity for further 
<br>cooperation on counter-smuggling and border security. He also 
<br>underscored the importance of targeting smuggling networks and 
<br>their financiers in Sudan and the Sinai-not just their activities. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) Dr. Kahl renewed Secretary of Defense Gate's offer to 
<br>assist the Egyptian military in expanding its counter-smuggling 
<br>efforts on the Sudanese border and the Red Sea region. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) Al-Assar stated that the smuggling tunnels threatened the 
<br>national security of Egypt (highlighting HAMAS specifically) and 
<br>that "terror" could come to Egypt via these tunnels. Egypt has 
<br>spent approximately $40 million to purchase the steel for the 
<br>underground wall on the Gaza border, and Egypt was paying the cost 
<br>of this wall in terms of public opinion both within Egypt and the 
<br>region. He noted that once the wall was in place, the time would 
<br>come to pressure Israel to take responsibility for the humanitarian 
<br>situation in Gaza. Dr. Kahl reaffirmed that in all of engagements 
<br>with Israel, the U.S. officials strongly encourage Israel to open 
<br>crossings into Gaza to allow humanitarian goods to cross, and that 
<br>Egypt's focus must be affixed on thwarting the movement of illicit 
<br>weapons into the strip. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>------------- 
<br>
<br>Homework 
<br>
<br>------------- 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) Dr. Kahl encouraged Egypt to sign a Communications 
<br>Electronics Security Agreement (CESA aka CISMOA) with the Unites 
<br>States, which would pave the way for the transfer of advanced 
<br>technology to Egypt and greatly increase interoperability. 
<br>Al-Assar stated that Egypt had "its reasons to delay a decision on 
<br>a CISMOA." He noted that thousands of Egyptian military officers 
<br>have participated in training and education programs in the United 
<br>States and learned about U.S. technology and strategy. He 
<br>commented that the younger officers are frustrated with the delay 
<br>in obtaining political release for more advanced U.S. technology. 
<br>Specifically, al-Assar referred to TOW2B and JAVELIN, which he 
<br>commented had already been released to other countries. Al-Assar 
<br>noted that a CISMOA was not a condition for obtaining these 
<br>systems, but instead they were held up due to a "third party". 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶17. (C) Al-Assar commented that Egypt was in negotiations with 
<br>Iraq to supply the Iraqi military with approximately 140 tanks, 
<br>which are manufactured at the FMF tank facility. He noted that the 
<br>Egyptian Ministry of Defense was awaiting the United States 
<br>positive response to its request for approval of the transfer. Dr. 
<br>Kahl noted that the U.S. was considering this request and would 
<br>provide a response soon. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶18. (C) Al-Assar encouraged Dr. Kahl to convince the U.S. 
<br>Congress that Egypt was worth more than $1.3 billion a year. Dr. 
<br>Kahl mentioned that Egypt receives the second largest amount of 
<br>assistance in the world, and that during these difficult financial 
<br>times in the United States, it was unlikely that annual flow of FMF 
<br>would increase. He did however reassure the Egyptian officials 
<br>that the USG would continue to advocate for current levels of FMF 
<br>and push back on any attempts to condition those funds.
