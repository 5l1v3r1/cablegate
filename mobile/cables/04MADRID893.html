<br>SUBJECT: MADRID MARCH 11 BOMB ATTACKS: STATUS OF
<br>INVESTIGATION
<br>
<br>Classified By: Carol Urban, Acting Deputy Chief of Mission, for Reasons
<br>1.4 (b) and (d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) The investigation into who perpetrated the March 11
<br>attacks in Madrid continues, with an Al Qaeda link looking
<br>increasingly likely. While authorities cannot completely
<br>rule out responsibility by the terrorist group ETA, or a
<br>possible ETA role in coordination with an Islamic terrorist
<br>group, the current major line of investigation is Al Qaeda.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Spanish authorities have detained five suspects, three
<br>Moroccan and two Indian citizens. All three Moroccans are
<br>said to have links to Imad Eddin Barakat Yarkas, who was
<br>indicted for his role as an alleged ringleader in Al Qaeda's
<br>organization in Spain. Authorities have reportedly linked
<br>the three to the attacks as a result of tracing the cell
<br>phone (the method used for detonation in the attacks) from
<br>one of the sportsbag bombs that did not detonate. The three
<br>Moroccans are Kamal ZOUGAM (other reported spelling: Kamal
<br>ZOUGAN)(DPOB: 05-OCT-1973, Tangiers, Morocco); Mohamed EL
<br>BEKKALI BOUTALIHA (DPOB: 05-JUN-1969, Achouta, Morocco); and
<br>Mohamed CHAQUI (other reported spelling: Mohamed
<br>CHAOUI)(DPOB: 26-JUN-1969, Tangiers, Morocco). All
<br>reportedly have police records and Zougam was named in
<br>Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon's September 2003 indictment of
<br>Barakat Yarkas, though not indicted himself. Zougam
<br>reportedly ran an internet cafe with Chaqui, his half-brother.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) The two Indians arrested are Vinay KHOLY (other
<br>reported spelling: Vinay KOHLY)(DPOB: 11-JUN-1976, Jalandhar,
<br>India) and Suresh KAMAR (DPOB: 27-JAN-1972, Hoshiarpur,
<br>India). Press sources say they sold the telephones to the
<br>detained Moroccans.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) On March 13, Spanish authorities were advised of a
<br>videotape placed in a trash container near a prominent
<br>mosque, located near the major M-30 roadway in Madrid. The
<br>tape purportedly shows a masked spokesman, going by the name
<br>of Abu Dujan AL AFGANI, who claims responsibility for the
<br>attacks on behalf of Al Qaeda's military group in Europe.
<br>The man reportedly speaks Arabic with a Moroccan accent.
<br>Newspaper accounts state that high-level Moroccan security
<br>officials will travel to Spain to aid in the investigation.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) The Madrid Community Government reports that as of
<br>today, the death toll from the attacks stands at 200. They
<br>also list a total of 1,647 people treated for injuries, with
<br>243 victims still hospitalized.
