<br>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR'S MEETING WITH FM MORATINOS ON
<br>BILATERAL RELATIONS
<br>
<br>REF: A. MADRID 3974
<br>¶B. MADRID 3929
<br>
<br>Classified By: DCM Bob Manzanares; reasons 1.4 (B) and (D).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary. The Ambassador called on FM Miguel Angel
<br>Moratinos on December 22 to review the progress made in
<br>U.S.-Spain relations over the last six months and to identify
<br>areas that remained problematic. He said the Spanish
<br>ship/plane sale to Venezuela had undermined progress in other
<br>areas, particularly given the mixed messages we received from
<br>the Spanish government in the runup to the conclusion of the
<br>deal. Moratinos acknowledged the damage inflicted by the
<br>episode, but insisted that he remained in charge of Spain's
<br>foreign relations and wanted to find areas to work more
<br>closely with the USG, particularly in Latin America. He
<br>complained that the USG seemed to hold Spain to a different
<br>standard than other EU countries and allowed disagreements on
<br>some issues to overshadow Spanish contributions on others,
<br>such as Afghanistan and BMENA. He expressed disappointment
<br>that Secretary Rice had been unable to attend the Euro
<br>Mediterranean Summit in November and noted the strong
<br>interest of Vice President Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega
<br>in visiting the U.S. in the near future. End Summary.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) The Ambassador noted that bilateral relations had
<br>improved substantially over the last six months, and there
<br>would have been even more progress had it not been for
<br>Spain's sale of ships and planes to Venezuela. He assured
<br>Moratinos that the USG knew that the Spanish MFA had made a
<br>good faith effort to derail the weapons deal, but had been
<br>outflanked by MOD Jose Bono. Moratinos acknowledged the
<br>basic facts of the issue and said that both he and Deputy FM
<br>Bernardino Leon had believed they had successfully turned off
<br>the aircraft component of the sale at the time they
<br>approached the Ambassador. However, MOD Bono did eventually
<br>win the internal debate and proceed with the sale.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) The Ambassador said it had been disconcerting for the
<br>USG to have such differing messages from the Spanish
<br>government regarding Venezuela (REF A). The Ambassador
<br>underscored his need to be certain that his primarily Spanish
<br>interlocutor (whom he understood to be Moratinos) could speak
<br>for the government on the most critical and sensitive issues.
<br>Otherwise, the Embassy's credibility in Washington would be
<br>eroded, to the detriment of all. Moratinos insisted that he
<br>spoke for the government on foreign affairs and, press
<br>reports to the contrary, had the full confidence of President
<br>Zapatero (COMMENT: Spanish media reported rumors that
<br>Zapatero had been displeased with the limited attendance and
<br>impact of the Euro Mediterranean Summit in Barcelona in
<br>November and was considering replacing Moratinos. Some in
<br>the diplomatic corps have also speculated on no Moratinos'
<br>eventual replacement, but we have reason to place much stock
<br>in this latest version. END COMMENT).
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Continuing on Venezuela, Moratinos said that there was
<br>much the USG and Spain could still do together despite
<br>friction over the sales, and that such cooperation fell
<br>squarely within the purview of the MFA. He said the Spanish
<br>government was concerned about the continuing anti-democratic
<br>drift of the Chavez government and understands that
<br>organizations such as the NGO "Sumate" need outside support.
<br>Moratinos said Spain would continue to monitor democratic
<br>conditions in Venezuela and lend its support whenever
<br>possible to steer events in a positive direction.
<br>
<br>//SPANISH ANGST OVER BILATERAL "VISUALS"//
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Adopting a more severe tone and saying he was
<br>delivering a message as Foreign Minister, Moratinos
<br>complained that the USG treated Spain differently than other
<br>EU countries, for example "singling out" Spain on weapons
<br>sales to Venezuela when other European countries were
<br>undertaking similar sales with no impact on their bilateral
<br>relations with the U.S. He wondered when the USG's goalposts
<br>for improved relations with Spain would remain constant. "We
<br>do so much with you on Afghanistan, Pakistan, and BMENA, yet
<br>one misstep and we're back starting over," he lamented.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Moratinos asked whether it would be reasonable to
<br>expect improved visuals in the bilateral relationship. The
<br>Ambassador noted that Secretary Rice did not have a visit to
<br>Madrid on her agenda and would probably not visit in the
<br>first part of 2006. The Ambassador said that if we had seen
<br>greater progress on issues such as Venezuela, we may have
<br>been able to envision higher-level contacts, but at this
<br>point such meetings seem doubtful. He noted that comments
<br>such as those made December 18 by President Zapatero taunting
<br>
<br>the Popular Party for its close relations with the U.S. were
<br>not helpful and undermined those who said that the Spanish
<br>government had moved away from using anti-Americanism for
<br>domestic political gain.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Returning to Latin America, Moratinos reiterated
<br>Spain's readiness to work with the USG on issues of mutual
<br>concern. He said democracy promotion and dealing with
<br>populist leaders such as Evo Morales posed a serious
<br>challenge to all of us. The Ambassador agreed, noting that
<br>we had congratulated Morales on his victory and hoped that he
<br>would govern democratically. Moratinos said Spain could work
<br>with the USG on Cuba (he did not elaborate). He noted
<br>Deputy FM Leon's good meetings with USG counterparts during
<br>his recent visit to Washington and said he looked forward to
<br>furthering our joint agenda during the upcoming visit of WHA
<br>A/S Tom Shannon.
<br>
<br>//SPANISH VP WANTS TO VISIT U.S.//
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Moratinos resurfaced the idea of having Vice President
<br>Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega visit the U.S. soon (REF
<br>B), saying he believed it was important for both our
<br>leaderships to understand where our common interests lie. He
<br>said the Vice President is very interested in making this
<br>visit and hoped the Embassy could work with the Spanish
<br>government to support the visit and arrange a strong agenda.
<br>Moratinos reiterated his disappointment that Secretary Rice
<br>had been unable to attend the Euro Mediterranean Summit,
<br>noting that he had worked hard to get the invitation for her
<br>despite UK resistance to the idea.
