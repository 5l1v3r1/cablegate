<br>Classified By: Ambassador James F. Jeffrey, Reasons 1.4 (b,d) 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) Summary:  On February 22 police detained 47 retired 
<br>and active-duty military officers, including 17 flag-grade 
<br>officers for -- according to press reports -- their alleged 
<br>involvement in coup plots dating back to 2003-2004.  Although 
<br>coverage of the detentions blanketed the press, neither the 
<br>Turkish General Staff (TGS) nor the government appear 
<br>publicly outraged (in the case of TGS) or congratulatory (the 
<br>governing Justice and Development Party) by the actions. 
<br>There has been no official statement from the TGS, and PM 
<br>Ergodan took a back seat by stating that the police were 
<br>simply acting on order from the judiciary.  (His attack dog 
<br>Deputy PM Arinc was more polemical.)  CHOD GEN Basbug 
<br>announced that he has postponed imminent travel to Egypt, and 
<br>late on February 23 called an emergency meeting with his 
<br>four-star generals and admirals.  Prosecutors have now 
<br>detained all of the force commanders from the 2003-2004 
<br>period with the exception of former CHOD Hilmi Ozkok and 
<br>former Turkish Land Forces Commander Aytac Yalman.  End 
<br>summary. 
<br> 
<br>Unprecedented Arrests... 
<br>------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (SBU) On February 22 nearly 50 retired and current 
<br>military officers (and one NCO) were detained, likely for 
<br>their alleged connections to the "Sledgehammer" (Balyoz) 
<br>investigations.  The homes and offices of many retired flag 
<br>officers were also searched and police seized and removed 
<br>documents for further inspection.  Among those detained were 
<br>four active duty admirals and 17 retired generals, including: 
<br> 
<br>--Ergin Saygun:  Former Deputy CHOD (2006-2008) and 1st Army 
<br>Commander (2008-2009).  Saygun is very well-known to the 
<br>U.S.; he was our primary coordinator on anti-terrorism issues 
<br>for many years, and had accompanied PM Erdogan during his 
<br>November 2007 visit to Washington. 
<br> 
<br>--Ibrahim Firtina:  Former Air Force Chief from 2003-2005. 
<br>Firtina was questioned in December 2009 by the Ergenekon 
<br>prosecutors and has been implicated in the press for his role 
<br>in the Sledgehammer Operation. 
<br> 
<br>--Cetin Dogan: Former 1st Army Commander (2002-2004). 
<br> 
<br>--Ozden Ornek:  Former Navy Chief (2003 - 2005).  Ornek's 
<br>diary, which allegedly details discussions among senior 
<br>military officers to start a coup between 2003-2005, is being 
<br>used by prosecutors as their primary source of evidence. 
<br>Ornek was also questioned by Ergenekon prosecutors in 
<br>December 2009. 
<br> 
<br>--Engin Alan:  LtG (retired). 
<br> 
<br>--Suha Tanyeli:  BG (retired). Tanyeli was head of the TGS 
<br>Strategic Research Center (SAREM). 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C) The operation itself appears to have been well 
<br>coordinated, as detentions and searches took place 
<br>simultaneously in Ankara, Istanbul, Izmir, Bursa, Diyarbakir, 
<br>Hatay, Kocaeli, and Bodrum.  There have been no official 
<br>pronouncements regarding the reasons for the operation, 
<br>although the press widely suspects that the arrests are in 
<br>connection with the 2003 Sledgehammer plan (which allegedly 
<br>included a plan to overthrow the AKP government (ref B) and a 
<br>separate plot known as "Operation Cage" (ref A)).  Press 
<br>reports state that many of the detained individuals' 
<br>signatures were found on "Sledgehammer" documents.  The 
<br>majority of individuals, according to the press, are being 
<br>interrogated in Istanbul. 
<br> 
<br>...But So What? 
<br>---------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) Despite the press fury, reaction from TGS and the 
<br>government has been minimal.  TGS has yet to make a official 
<br>statement.  However, TGS CHOD General Ilker Basbug postponed 
<br>his official travel to Egypt -- an extraordinary and 
<br> 
<br>ANKARA 00000294  002 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>unprecedented step -- and late on February 23 called an 
<br>emergency meeting with his four-star generals and admirals. 
<br>When asked about the arrests PM Erdogan, in Spain for a state 
<br>visit, told reporters that the police were acting on the 
<br>order of the judiciary.  Although a few "usual suspects" 
<br>inflammatory statements from the opposition -- such as 
<br>Republican Peoples' Party (CHP) Chairman Deniz Baykal's 
<br>statement that the arrests made it feel was "as if Turkey was 
<br>under occupation" -- made it into the press initially, 
<br>overall press reactions were overshadowed the following day 
<br>by other news stories.  Markets opened up this morning, and 
<br>business continues as usual. 
<br> 
<br>Bad for TGS?  Good for AKP? 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) This is the largest "round-up" of military officers to 
<br>date; the lack of an immediate reaction from TGS may suggest 
<br>that the (current) military leadership is either fully 
<br>willing to allow this investigation and the democratic 
<br>process to continue unimpeded, or is waiting for AKP to hang 
<br>itself on unfounded allegations.  The military remains deeply 
<br>unhappy about AKP's governance and is enraged at the steady 
<br>campaign to erode the military's standing in Turkish society. 
<br> To date, prosecutors have now detained all of the senior 
<br>military commanders from the 2003-2004 period with the 
<br>exception of former CHOD Hilmi Ozkok and former Land Forces 
<br>Commander Aytac Yalman.  And although the TGS seemed to be 
<br>caught off balance and therefore was unwilling to speak up 
<br>yesterday in strong opposition to these ongoing 
<br>investigations, it seems unlikely that it will remain silent. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) AKP appears to have concluded that it gains 
<br>politically from the arrest of military officers.  Having 
<br>perhaps nevertheless learned from past experiences, PM 
<br>Erdogan was shielded from what could have been outraged 
<br>criticism by secularists by conveniently being outside of the 
<br>country.  His absence also did not allow for any publicized 
<br>"urgent" meeting with CHOD Basbug, as has happened in the 
<br>past.  Deputy PM Bulent Arinc's statements appeared designed 
<br>to spin these developments as yet another example of how 
<br>"times have changed" in Turkey and how the country is merely 
<br>going through a "normalization" period. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) The next few days will prove interesting and possibly 
<br>pivotal.  The judiciary has four days to either turn the 
<br>detentions into formal arrests or release the individuals. 
<br>If formal charges are brought, TGS will be forced to respond. 
<br> Likewise, a lack of substantive evidence will rebound on the 
<br>Government, and will give credence to accusations that the 
<br>long-running Ergenekon investigation has a deeper and more 
<br>insidious design:  to undermine AKP's secular opposition. 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (C) Some knowledgeable embassy officers see this latest 
<br>step as a more serious provocation that could trigger some 
<br>type of unpredictable military reaction.  We will see. 
<br> 
<br>COMMENT 
<br>-------- 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (C) To repeat the facts on this whole "Ergenekon" set of 
<br>events: 
<br> 
<br>a.  There is some "fire" behind the smoke.  The military 
<br>obviously has plans to intervene if necessary in political 
<br>affairs and can cite the 1982 constitution, endorsed by the 
<br>population per referendum, which gives the military a key 
<br>role in "overseeing" democratic governments' adherence to 
<br>Ataturkist principles -- largely defined as by the military 
<br>and its friends in the bureaucracy and judiciary. 
<br> 
<br>b.  PM Erdogan (supported by the EU and even many 
<br>anti-Erdogan Turkes who want to see the military out of 
<br>politics) legitimately wants to rein in this "droit de 
<br>regard" status. 
<br> 
<br>c.  But PM Erdogan realizes that elections are coming up, and 
<br>that he did relatively poorly in last year's elections (38%) 
<br>but brilliantly in 2007 (47% AKP win) when he played off the 
<br>military's counter-productive threats. 
<br> 
<br>d.  Thus much of this is electoral poiltics, albeit of a 
<br> 
<br>ANKARA 00000294  003 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>"below the belt" contact sport variety. 
<br> 
<br>e.  All this is exacerbated by the thuggish authoritarian 
<br>behavior of the police and judiciary (reflecting prevailing 
<br>tendencies in this society, including in the military).  In 
<br>the U.S. a prosecutor or detective would simply have visited 
<br>the generals in question to post questions.  "Invites" to the 
<br>precinct, reading of rights, indictments, arrests, and 
<br>detentions follow only after the amassing of evidence and 
<br>clear indications of a case winnable in court.  Not here. 
<br>Anyone even suspected of "having information" is hauled 
<br>before the police (armed with automatic weapons), and 
<br>humiliated before the press.  It's always been that way; now 
<br>it's happening also to the top brass and their friends. 
<br> 
<br>f.  Up to now, however, most of those so publicly humiliated 
<br>are eventually released due to patent innocence,a lack of 
<br>evidence (as in the recent "Special Forces officers planning 
<br>Arinc's assassination" caper -- ref A) or because the 
<br>judiciary throws the whole process out (i.e. the law making 
<br>military officers subject to civilian courts -- ref C). 
<br> 
<br>g.  But every day is a new one here, and no one can be 
<br>certain where this whole choreography will fall out of whack. 
<br> Then, look out.
