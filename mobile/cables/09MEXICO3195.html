<br>TAGS: PREL PGOV PINR MX
<br>SUBJECT: MEXICO: MORE INTERAGENCY COOPERATION NEEDED ON 
<br>INTELLIGENCE ISSUES 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Gustavo Delgado. 
<br>Reason: 1.4 (b),(d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) Summary. President Calderon's security strategy 
<br>lacks an effective intelligence apparatus to produce high 
<br>quality information and targeted operations. Embassy 
<br>officers working with the GOM report that Mexico's use of 
<br>strategic and tactical intelligence is fractured, ad hoc, and 
<br>reliant on U.S. support. Despite their myriad inefficiencies 
<br>and deficiencies, Mexican security services broadly recognize 
<br>the need for improvement. Sustained U.S. assistance can help 
<br>shape and fortify the technical capacity of institutions and 
<br>can also create a more reliable, collegial inter-agency 
<br>environment. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>GOM Intel Strategy Criticized 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Recent criticism of President Calderon's security 
<br>strategy cites a poorly utilized and underdeveloped 
<br>intelligence apparatus as a key obstacle to greater 
<br>improvements in the country's security environment. 
<br>Calderon's political opponents from both the Institutional 
<br>Revolutionary Party (PRI) and the Revolutionary Democratic 
<br>Party (PRD) have told Poloff that large-scale joint 
<br>military-police counterdrug deployments, notably Joint 
<br>Operation Chihuahua, have failed to make real gains in the 
<br>war against organized crime due to a reliance on overwhelming 
<br>numerical superiority of troops absent the strategic and 
<br>operational use of intelligence. Critics argue that the more 
<br>effective use of intelligence would help the security 
<br>services better cooperate on counterdrug issues, wrap-up more 
<br>high-level traffickers, and, eventually, curb the country's 
<br>escalating rates of narco-related violence. Emboffs working 
<br>with the GOM in counter-narcotics and intelligence matters 
<br>similarly note that Mexico's use of strategic and tactical 
<br>intelligence is often fractured, ad hoc, and heavily reliant 
<br>on the United States for leads and operations. 
<br>
<br>The Players 
<br>----------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) A myriad of GOM agencies have a stake in 
<br>counternarcotics intel issues, including the Secretariats of 
<br>Defense (SEDENA) and Marines (SEMAR), the Mexican National 
<br>Intelligence Center (CISEN), the Public Security Secretariat 
<br>(SSP), which includes the federal police, and the Attorney 
<br>General's Office (PGR). Each has a different intelligence 
<br>mission and varying levels of development and 
<br>professionalism. As Mexico's primary intelligence agency, 
<br>CISEN is the natural choice to be the GOM's coordinator of 
<br>intelligence and analytic efforts. Indeed, it technically 
<br>has the lead on encouraging interagency coordination and is 
<br>developing mechanisms to facilitate such endeavors. For the 
<br>most part, however, CISEN lacks the capacity to effectively 
<br>direct the inter-agency process, particularly when it 
<br>includes such institutional giants as SSP, which 
<br>bureaucratically overshadows CISEN in budget, personnel, and 
<br>other resource issues. CISEN's inability thus far to serve 
<br>as a real leader on intelligence operations and analysis has 
<br>effectively left Mexico without an effective interagency 
<br>coordinator. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) SSP is increasingly becoming a major player on the 
<br>intel block. It is exploring ways to take advantage of new 
<br>authorities granted under the Federal Police reform 
<br>legislation passed last year to develop its intelligence 
<br>capabilities. SSP can now directly solicit telephonic 
<br>information from phone companies with a judicial order, 
<br>bypassing the PGR entirely. It is also interested in 
<br>building its own complete telecommunications intercept 
<br>capability, the implementation of which has stalled over the 
<br>past two years because of turf disputes between SSP and the 
<br>Attorney General's Office. Moreover, as the keeper of 
<br>Plataforma Mexico -- the massive new criminal database -- the 
<br>SSP oversees one of the GOM's cornerstone and resource-heavy 
<br>information-sharing projects. 
<br>
<br>
<br>MEXICO 00003195 002 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>The Challenges 
<br>-------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) The GOM faces a number of institutional challenges 
<br>to more effectively develop, analyze, and use information for 
<br>intelligence-based operations. One of the most critical of 
<br>these is the lack of trust between and within GOM 
<br>institutions. Emboffs report that SEDENA, for example, has 
<br>well-established intel units that develop targeting packages 
<br>on cartel kingpins. In general, they do not share 
<br>information or analysis with forces on the ground deployed to 
<br>fight counternarcotics, like in Ciudad Juarez. These units 
<br>will share threat information against military components, 
<br>but also see local military commands as often penetrated by 
<br>organized crime. Locally deployed SEDENA forces rarely 
<br>develop or utilize tactical intelligence. In fact, they have 
<br>no true intel units that collect information, nor do they 
<br>have professional intel corps. Military units deployed to 
<br>hotspots operate virtually blind except for anonymous tips. 
<br>Particularly given the fallout from the high-level corruption 
<br>cases uncovered last year, PGR and SSP suffer from similar 
<br>internal suspicions as SEDENA. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) Institutions are fiercely protective of their own 
<br>information and equities and are reluctant to share 
<br>information with outsiders, in part because of corruption 
<br>fears, but also because they would rather hoard intelligence 
<br>than allow a rival agency to succeed. They are under 
<br>enormous pressure to produce results. Moreover, bureaucratic 
<br>culture in Mexico is generally risk averse, so intelligence 
<br>entities would rather do nothing than do something wrong. 
<br>Corruption fears are well-founded given the number of 
<br>operations that have been compromised or foiled because of 
<br>leaks. Emboffs note that constructing an effective 
<br>intelligence structure in Mexico's northern border area is 
<br>particularly difficult, as many of the region's security 
<br>forces are compromised. The rivalry between Attorney General 
<br>Medina Mora -- recently replaced by Arturo Chavez Chavez -- 
<br>and SSP,s Genaro Garcia Luna dramatically diminished 
<br>cooperation and information-sharing between the two services. 
<br>Leadership and personality conflicts may, in fact, be one of 
<br>the most significant drivers of whether or not agencies set 
<br>themselves up as rivals or allies in sharing important 
<br>information. Some observers see the new federal police and 
<br>PGR reforms as unlikely to resolve the zero sum competition, 
<br>and it is too early to know whether the Chavez appointment 
<br>will mitigate the specific PGR-SSP problem. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S/NF) There are also some legal and institutional 
<br>unknowns: SSP, which receives the bulk of the GOM's security 
<br>budget, now has the legal backing it needs to allow Garcia 
<br>Luna to move ahead in building a large new intelligence and 
<br>investigative program. With such indigenous capabilities, 
<br>SSP probably would have even less incentive to cooperate with 
<br>PGR. SEDENA, meanwhile, tends to work better with PGR than 
<br>with SSP, but the Army's efforts are still highly limited and 
<br>compartmentalized and it remains to be seen how better 
<br>vetting practices and a stronger SSP will impact those 
<br>relations. Secretary of Defense Galvan Galvan in a recent 
<br>meeting with U.S. officials expressed little interest in 
<br>bolstering cooperation with other agencies. Because of 
<br>internal strife and mistrust in GOM institutions, Mission law 
<br>enforcement agencies say that USG elements tend to work with 
<br>GOM counterparts separately, which may end up indirectly 
<br>contributing to stovepiping. 
<br>
<br>Taking Steps to Get Smart 
<br>------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (S/NF) There is broad recognition among Mexican security 
<br>and intelligence agencies, as well as political leadership, 
<br>that they must do better in developing sources, analyzing 
<br>information, and using it operationally. They also know that 
<br>the effective use of intelligence requires more complete 
<br>collaboration between involved bureaucracies. Despite its 
<br>deficiencies, the GOM does have some intelligence 
<br>capabilities, and Emboffs note that when they are deployed in 
<br>full force, as in Michoacan, they can do good work. 
<br>
<br>MEXICO 00003195 003 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶9. (S/NF) The GOM is working hard to improve communication 
<br>among agencies with a stake in intelligence. CISEN is trying 
<br>to develop mechanisms to facilitate coordination. For 
<br>example, CISEN has established at its Mexico City 
<br>headquarters a fusion center that has representatives from 
<br>every involved agency, including the Finance Secretariat, 
<br>SSP, PGR, SEMAR, SEDENA, and state and local investigators 
<br>when they can be trusted. Mexico is also in the process of 
<br>establishing a series of Tactical Operations Intelligence 
<br>Units (UNITOS) at military bases in each state throughout the 
<br>country. The GOM has established a number of units (reports 
<br>range from 9 to 27) with participation from the Army, Navy, 
<br>SSP, PGR, and CISEN, comprising a command section, tactical 
<br>analysis group, investigations group, operations sector, and 
<br>a cadre of judicial experts. When properly functioning, the 
<br>UNITOs provides a centralizing platform for federal forces to 
<br>work together, share information, and plan operations. It is 
<br>still unclear as to whether these would be short or long term 
<br>units, but if implemented correctly, they might serve as a 
<br>key piece of a revamped GOM intel and operational 
<br>architecture. So far, the UNITOs are plagued by the same 
<br>interagency rivals and mistrust that characterize the broader 
<br>institutional relationships and have not yet reached the 
<br>point of being effective. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) The state-level C-4 centers (command, control, 
<br>communications, and coordination) are, at the low end, 
<br>glorified emergency call centers. At the high end, they 
<br>include more professional analytic cells that produce useful 
<br>analysis and planning documents and also have a quick 
<br>response time. The more complete C-4s include 
<br>representatives from national and regional entities, and are 
<br>the nerve centers for day-to-day information flow, 
<br>intelligence, and directing operations in the state. They 
<br>are often also the link to national databases, such as 
<br>Plataforma Mexico. Huge disparities between state C-4s 
<br>exist, but many states are working to move their units from 
<br>merely housing emergency dispatchers to being functional hubs 
<br>of operations and intelligence. The UNITOs often rely on 
<br>information fed from good C-4s, in addition to federal 
<br>databases and platforms. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Plataforma Mexico is another important piece of the 
<br>intel puzzle and continues to expand its presence throughout 
<br>the country. The mega-criminal database has a wide array of 
<br>information-sharing and analytical tools that 
<br>help to track and share information on individuals and 
<br>organized crime cells, vehicles, air movements, and is linked 
<br>with an increasing number of surveillance and security 
<br>cameras. The database is housed at SSP and is being deployed 
<br>to an increasing number of states, with different tiers of 
<br>access that are controlled through the vetting system. Not 
<br>all states have access, mostly because they have yet to 
<br>comply with federal standards in order to be connected, and 
<br>some states with access have complained that the system is 
<br>too slow to be of any use to them. Additionally, Project 
<br>Constanza is PGR's new case tracking system for the judicial 
<br>system, and will include all data related to individual cases 
<br>of persons apprehended and later charged. Some pieces may be 
<br>made available to Plataforma Mexico, and PGR would like to 
<br>have a system for tracking detentions that can be made 
<br>available to police units when apprehending a suspect. The 
<br>Mission is actively engaged in trying to plug E-Trace, ATF's 
<br>powerful arms tracing software, into both systems. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (S/NF) Despite myriad challengece, cooperation with the 
<br>USG on intelligence and counternarcotics issues has never 
<br>been better. Indeed, Embassy experts say that Mexican 
<br>authorities often rely on tips from U.S. law enforcement and 
<br>intelligence organizations, and that many successful captures 
<br>of important cartel figures are often backed by U.S. 
<br>assistance. Mexico has indicated interest in improving its 
<br>collection and use of intelligence with additional U.S. help. 
<br>For example, in early 2009 the director of the National 
<br>Security Information Center came to Mexico to, among other 
<br>things, meet with CISEN Director Valdez (NSIC runs the Merida 
<br>Culture of Lawfulness project but also works in the field of 
<br>
<br>MEXICO 00003195 004 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>intelligence structures in democratic societies). He pitched 
<br>to Valdez a program developed by NSIC to divide a hostile 
<br>zone into a series of quadrants and assign a team to each 
<br>that contains four specialties - interviewers (Humint), 
<br>signals interceptors (Sigint), analysts, and operators - as 
<br>well as an adequate security contingent to keep the members 
<br>secure in their safe area and during movement. The teams 
<br>take up residence in the area, as clandestinely as possible, 
<br>and begin to develop sources and information that is used to 
<br>make arrests. At 
<br>the same time, the team filters raw and semi-processed 
<br>information to the next level, which has a parallel 
<br>structure, but more robust operations capabilities and higher 
<br>level skill sets, especially for analyzing the information. 
<br>The ideas is to develop strategic, as opposed to tactical, 
<br>information that can be used to take apart whole networks. 
<br>Valdez was impressed by the concept, and directed his deputy, 
<br>Gustavo Mohar, to meet with the Embassy's NAS Director to 
<br>discuss its viability in U.S. programming. NAS Director and 
<br>Legatt met with Mohar and suggested that in the training line 
<br>of Merida it would be possible to pursue such a program. 
<br>
<br>COMMENT 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶13. (S/NF) Mexico is a long way from developing a 
<br>self-sufficient and expert intelligence apparatus, but the 
<br>creation of a coherent system is critical for the sustained 
<br>success of its anti-organized crime efforts. USG-GOM 
<br>cooperation, while not flawless, has never been better. 
<br>Close collaboration and assistance in training and improving 
<br>Mexican security agencies' ability to produce and use 
<br>intelligence in key counterdrug operations undoubtedly is 
<br>critical and will pay dividends over time. Perhaps the 
<br>greatest challenge to lasting progress on intelligence 
<br>matters is cultivating an environment of trust -- based on 
<br>high standards of security -- among Mexico's law enforcement, 
<br>military, and intelligence agencies to ensure that 
<br>information is appropriately collected, shared, protected, 
<br>and acted upon. Reducing institutional rivalries and 
<br>encouraging agencies to move past the zero-sum mindset that 
<br>one entity's success in catching a high-value target is 
<br>another's loss is also critical to reducing rivalries and 
<br>distrust on intelligence issues. The growing SSP footprint 
<br>on intelligence matters has the potential to seriously impact 
<br>the information-sharing dynamic, a factor that will have to 
<br>be integrated into our assistance programs to ensure that we 
<br>do not exacerbate existing institutional tensions, 
<br>particularly with the PGR. While our Mexican interlocutors 
<br>recognize the need for greater interagency cooperation, they 
<br>are reluctant to address the problem: the solution will 
<br>require sustained U.S. help in fortifying institutions 
<br>against the corruption, inefficiencies and backbiting that 
<br>have bred distrust amongst GOM partners. 
<br>
<br>¶14. (S/NF) The USG can help Mexico develop inter-agency 
<br>capabilities, and there are a number of line items in the 
<br>Merida Initiative that can be employed in this effort. For 
<br>example: the polygraph program properly pushed out to the 
<br>states and consistently applied to special units could help 
<br>produce the core integrity and trust that all good 
<br>intelligence will depend on; the state-level law enforcement 
<br>C-4 coordination centers, when done right, can bring all 
<br>agencies and information together; Plataforma Mexico, the 
<br>core database for law enforcement information-sharing, is 
<br>rolling out across Mexico with new resources in 2009 that 
<br>will enhance its capabilities and accessibility; through law 
<br>enforcement professionalization, we are training 
<br>investigators who will be a key piece of the intelligence 
<br>puzzle as they serve as front-line collectors; we will be 
<br>supporting vetted units -- among the highest yielding 
<br>entities in the GOM for intelligence -- with USD 5 million of 
<br>FY2009 funding. Perhaps most importantly, these programs can 
<br>serve as effective carrots to resolve the entrenched mistrust 
<br>and parochialism of Mexican institutions by ensuring that 
<br>organizations come to the table together when necessary to 
<br>support the GOM's efforts to combat rife corruption within 
<br>its institutions.
