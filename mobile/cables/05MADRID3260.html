<br>
<br>Classified By: Polcouns Kathy Fitzpatrick; reason 1.5 (B) and (D).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary. Spain is both a significant target of
<br>Islamic terrorist groups and a major logistical hub for
<br>Islamic extremist groups operating across the globe. The
<br>March 11, 2004 train bombings made Madrid the site of the
<br>worst terrorist attack in the history of the EU and triggered
<br>the second major crackdown in three years against Spain-based
<br>Islamic terrorist groups. Historically, Spain-based
<br>extremists have tended to be older (30-40 years),
<br>first-generation immigrants with a history of militant
<br>activity in their home countries. The first Islamists did
<br>not establish themselves in Spain until the late 1980s and
<br>early 1990s, coming mainly from Syria and Algeria. The
<br>influx of large numbers of North African immigrants is
<br>changing the profile of Spain-based Islamic extremists,
<br>creating a large pool of young, alienated men available for
<br>recruitment.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Extremist groups active in Spain tend to be
<br>decentralized, collaborating on an ad hoc basis and united
<br>more by friendships, family ties, and loyalty to the global
<br>jihadist cause than by membership in any given terrorist
<br>organization. While Spain-based groups at first focused on
<br>organizing themselves and providing logistical support to
<br>extremists in other countries, they became increasingly
<br>aggressive after the September 11 attacks and the subsequent
<br>GOS crackdown on Islamist terrorist cells in Spain. Spain's
<br>withdrawal of troops from Iraq does not appear to have
<br>reduced the desire of extremists to strike at Spanish targets
<br>and Spanish authorities, long focused on Basque terrorism,
<br>have shifted gears to deal with the growing threat posed by
<br>Islamic extremists. Police have disrupted multiple terrorist
<br>networks over the last year, including a group that funneled
<br>suicide bombers from Spain to Iraq, and are currently holding
<br>approximately 130 suspects in connection with Islamic
<br>terrorist activities. In July, the GOS concluded a four-year
<br>investigation and trial of 24 members of a local al-Qa'ida
<br>cell; the Court is expected to render a decision September
<br>¶20. There are at least 300 suspected Islamist terrorists or
<br>logistical operatives in Spain and the Ministry of Interior's
<br>senior terrorism adviser believes there may be as many as
<br>1,000. Spain-based terrorists are believed to target local
<br>USG interests; for example, one of the Madrid train bombers
<br>was spotted conducting surveillance of the Embassy building
<br>one year prior to the train attacks. The rapid growth of the
<br>Moroccan immigrant community, combined with worrisome trends
<br>among Spain-based extremist groups, suggest that Spain is
<br>likely to remain an active front in the war on terror for
<br>many years to come. End Summary.
<br>
<br>//THE ISLAMIC COMMUNITY IN SPAIN//
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) There are an estimated 600,000-800,000 Muslims in
<br>Spain, and possibly up to one million, the majority of them
<br>recent immigrants from Morocco. The recent upsurge in
<br>illegal immigration makes a more accurate figure difficult to
<br>establish. Not surprisingly, the growth of Spain's Islamic
<br>population has been especially robust in its North African
<br>enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, where a GOS report forecast
<br>that Muslims would become a majority within the next several
<br>years (and warned that only 40 percent of residents
<br>considered themselves "pro-Spanish.") Prior to the arrival
<br>of large numbers of North African immigrants in the late
<br>1990s, Spain's Muslim population was comprised of immigrants
<br>from Pakistan and the Middle East, as well as a growing
<br>number of Spanish-born converts to Islam. Spanish converts,
<br>numbering some 20,000, tend to gather and to worship at their
<br>own institutions. Converts are well represented in Spain's
<br>leading Islamic institutions including the Islamic Commision
<br>of Spain (CIE), which serves as the official interface
<br>between the Islamic community and the Spanish government.
<br>The CIE includes major organizations such as the Islamic
<br>Federation of Spain and the Union of Islamic Communities in
<br>Spain. Over 240 mosques and 64 religious communities are
<br>officially registered with the CIE; approximately 160 mosques
<br>in Spain do not belong to the CIE. Immigrants rights
<br>organization "ATIME" is not a religious group, but most of
<br>its members are Moroccan Muslims. ATIME recently angered CIE
<br>leaders by proposing the creation of a new Islamic council to
<br>incorporate the views of more recent arrivals in Spain and
<br>establish controls to monitor against the teaching of
<br>extremist ideologies by imams (implying that the CIE does not
<br>adequately represent the views of the growing Moroccan
<br>community or police its own members). Observers believe that
<br>no more than 15 percent of Spanish Muslims regularly attend
<br>religious services, though many likely attend services at
<br>informal houses of worship, known as "oratorios."
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) Until now, the broader Muslim community in Spain has
<br>been of little importance to the activities of local
<br>extremist groups. During the 1990s, the vast majority of
<br>Spain-based Islamist radicals were recent immigrants with a
<br>history of militant activity in their home countries. Very
<br>few were second-generation immigrants or Spanish converts to
<br>Islam. Islamic extremists coalesced in Spanish mosques and
<br>continue to use them to distribute propaganda and scout for
<br>new recruits, but they have had only limited success in using
<br>mosques to tap into the broader Muslim community.
<br>Authorities believe Islamist radicals prefer informal
<br>religious instruction groups as a way to attract new members
<br>and maintain group cohesion rather than working in mosques
<br>where they are vulnerable to surveillance by police and other
<br>mosque members.
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) Spain's largest mosque is co-located with the Islamic
<br>Cultural Center in Madrid and is popularly known as the "M-30
<br>Mosque" because of its proximity to the M-30 highway, a
<br>principal artery through Madrid. The M-30 Mosque is funded
<br>by the Government of Saudi Arabia. Though the imams at the
<br>M-30 Mosque are considered moderate by Spanish authorities,
<br>suspected extremists are known to attend services there.
<br>Prosecutors are investigating the former director of M-30
<br>Mosque for his alleged role in transferring funds to a
<br>suspicious NGO; the USG is assisting with this investigation.
<br>Separately, three imams from the Catalan region were the key
<br>figures in a network that facilitated the movement of
<br>jihadists from Spain to Iraq to undertake terrorist acts
<br>against Coalition and Iraqi Government targets. Their
<br>mosques served as recruitment and indoctrination centers for
<br>terrorist volunteers. This network was dismantled by police
<br>in June, 2005. In addition to recruiting through mosques,
<br>Islamist radicals distribute propaganda at Koranic schools,
<br>halal butcher shops, and Islamic centers.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Islamic extremists are not connected to any political
<br>organization in Spain. There are no Islamist (or even
<br>Islamic) political parties that could be used as a cover for
<br>jihadist activities. This may begin to change as the
<br>burgeoning population of North African immigrants, especially
<br>Moroccans, begins to establish its own institutions in Spain.
<br>There are no significant Spain-based Islamic extremist
<br>publications, though many Spanish extremists have connections
<br>to publications elsewhere in Europe, such as London.
<br>
<br>//ISLAMIC TERRORISM - A RECENT ARRIVAL IN SPAIN//
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Though Spain was the site of several Islamic terrorist
<br>attacks during the 1980s, including a 1985 bombing by Islamic
<br>Jihad near Torrejon Air Base outside of Madrid that killed 18
<br>and wounded 82, there are few indications of extremist groups
<br>operating from Spain prior to the mid 1990s. The first
<br>Islamic terrorist organizations were formed by Syrian members
<br>of the Muslim Brotherhood who had fled repression by the Asad
<br>regime and settled in Spain in the late 1980s. Police
<br>believe Palestinian radical Anwar Adnan Mohamed Salah, AKA
<br>"Chej Salah," and Syrian al-Qa'ida member and propagandist
<br>Mustafa Setmarian, AKA "Abu Mus'ab al-Suri," played a
<br>critical role in organizing Syrian exiles in Spain to support
<br>the international jihadist movement. In 1994, Setmarian
<br>moved to London to work with the Algerian Armed Islamic Group
<br>(GIA) publication "al-Ansar" and Salah went to Pakistan to
<br>work with al-Qa'ida leader Abu Zubaydah in funneling recruits
<br>to terrorist training camps in Afghanistan. From 1995 until
<br>his 2001 arrest, Imad Eddin Barakat Yarkas led the Syrian
<br>group in Spain, during which period this cell expanded its
<br>activities and aided the development of other Islamist
<br>extremist groups. Yarkas and many of the other Syrian
<br>extremists were relatively educated, prosperous, and
<br>projected the appearance of being well established in Spain.
<br>They reportedly raised terrorism funds by working with
<br>Moroccan criminals engaged in fraud, robbery, and theft of
<br>mobile phones.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) As Syrian extremists were becoming more organized to
<br>lend support to international jihadist movements, Algerian
<br>GIA members began arriving in Spain in significant numbers,
<br>fleeing capture by the Algerian authorities. GIA members
<br>settled in eastern Spain, mostly near Alicante and Valencia,
<br>which have ferry connections to Algerian ports. Many GIA
<br>members in Spain acted in a support capacity for GIA fighters
<br>in Algeria, though some moved on to work for international
<br>jihadist causes. The Salafist Group for Call and Combat
<br>(GSPC), which eclipsed the GIA in Spain as elsewhere, was
<br>detected by 2001 and in June of that year Spanish police
<br>arrested GSPC member Mohamed Benshakria, who had fled Germany
<br>to avoid arrest in connection with the "Meliani cell" that
<br>had planned terrorist attacks in Strasbourg.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) South Asian extremists also arrived in Spain, with
<br>most settling in the large Pakistani communities in
<br>Barcelona, Bibao, Santander, and Logrono. Pakistani Islamist
<br>radicals appear to play a mainly logistical role,
<br>particularly in providing false documents and in transferring
<br>funds. Spanish authorities are concerned that extremist
<br>elements may have insinuated themselves into Pakistani
<br>communities in the Catalan and La Rioja regions in order to
<br>provide support and raise funds for militant
<br>Pakistani/Kashmiri organizations such as Lashkar-i-Taiba,
<br>Harakat-ul Mujahideen, Jaish-e Mohammad, Lashkar-e Jangvi,
<br>and Jihad-e-Islami al-Alami. Recent reports indicate that
<br>Dubai is a key financial hub for Spain-based Pakistani hawala
<br>organizations, including those hawalas with links to crime
<br>and/or terrorism. Police arrested 10 Pakistani nationals on
<br>fraud charges in Barcelona in September 2004 and subsequently
<br>discovered indications that the group had apparently funneled
<br>money to senior al-Qa'ida figures in Pakistan and had made
<br>suspicious videos of Barcelona landmarks. The group remains
<br>in detention.
<br>
<br>//MOROCCANS ARRIVE//
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) The most important recent development in the local
<br>Islamic extremist community has been the influx of Moroccan
<br>radicals. They arrived in the 1990s along with tens of
<br>thousands of Moroccan economic migrants, who have become by
<br>far the largest Muslim immigrant community in Spain (500,000
<br>Moroccans compared to approximately 40,000 Algerians, the
<br>next-largest group). While some of the more important
<br>Moroccan extremists matched their Syrian and Algerian
<br>counterparts in terms of first-hand experience operating
<br>against their government, many low-level supporters were only
<br>recruited after their arrival in Spain. Moroccan extremists
<br>tend to be less well off and most are involved in criminal
<br>activity, such as drug trafficking (primarily hashish) and/or
<br>fraud. Since the September 11 attacks in the U.S., the
<br>Casablanca bombings in Morocco, the interventions in
<br>Afghanistan and Iraq, and the dismantlement of the Barakat
<br>Yarkas network, Moroccan extremists appear to have moved to
<br>the forefront of the jihadist community in Spain, at least in
<br>numerical terms. The large and growing Moroccan community
<br>provides Islamic extremist recruiters in Spain with an ample
<br>supply of poor, alienated young men and access to funds from
<br>drug trafficking and other illegal activities.
<br>
<br>//TERRORIST GROUPS ACTIVE IN SPAIN//
<br>
<br>¶11. (S) The extremist community in Spain is decentralized,
<br>with few national or institutional barriers and frequent ad
<br>hoc collaboration among radicals from different
<br>organizations. Few local organizations emphasize themselves
<br>as a unit and organization names appear to be unimportant.
<br>However, many extremists in Spain are affiliated to some
<br>degree with organized jihadist groups in other countries. In
<br>total, police believe there are at least 300 Islamic radicals
<br>active in Spain and Ministry of Interior Senior Adviser on
<br>Terrorism Professor Fernando Reinares estimates there may be
<br>as many as 1,000 such extremists. Islamic terrorist
<br>organizations with a presence in Spain include:
<br>
<br>-- al-Qa'ida: Barakat Yarkas and other members of the Syrian
<br>group had direct links to al-Qa'ida. Barakat Yarkas is
<br>charged with murder for allegedly organizing Mohamed Atta's
<br>crucial meeting with Ramzi Binalshibh during Atta's final
<br>preparations for the September 11 attacks. A decision is
<br>expected in his case on September 20. Other extremist
<br>organizations in Spain draw inspiration from al-Qa'ida, but
<br>there is no clear indication that they act under instruction
<br>from the leadership of the organization.
<br>
<br>-- Moroccan Islamic Combat Group (GICM): Police have drawn
<br>connections between terrorists involved in the Madrid train
<br>bombings and the GICM figures that carried out the 2003
<br>Casablanca attacks, but it appears that the Madrid bombings
<br>were organized and executed at the local level rather than
<br>under instruction from the GICM leadership. Senior GICM
<br>figure Hassan al-Haski was arrested in the Canary Islands in
<br>December 2004 for his alleged role in the March 11 train
<br>bombings.
<br>
<br>-- Salafist Group for Call and Combat (GSPC): According to
<br>Spanish authorities, GSPC members in Spain appear to act with
<br>a high degree of autonomy from their leadership in Algeria.
<br>Many suspected GSPC members seem to be acting in support of
<br>local and global jihadist causes rather than being dedicated
<br>to the conflict in Algeria.
<br>
<br>-- Armed Islamic Group (GIA): GIA was an important force
<br>during the formative period of Islamist extremist groups in
<br>Spain in the early 1990s, but no longer maintains a
<br>significant presence in the country, since many GIA members
<br>have been arrested, abandoned the GIA to join the GSPC, or
<br>joined other local Islamist causes. March 11 train bombing
<br>suspect Allekema Lamari served five years in a Spanish prison
<br>on charges of being a GIA member.
<br>
<br>-- Ansar-al-Islam: Ansar-al-Islam does not have a formal
<br>presence in Spain, but a Spain-based organization affiliated
<br>with the group was responsible for recruiting suicide bombers
<br>to attack coalition forces in Iraq. Spanish authorities
<br>dismantled the cell in June, 2005, jailing eight and holding
<br>seven for deportation proceedings. Three of those detained
<br>were imams at Barcelona-area mosques. The cell reportedly
<br>succeeded in sending Mohamed Afalah, an extremist involved in
<br>the Madrid train bombings, to Iraq where he may have carried
<br>out a suicide attack against Iraqi government or Coalition
<br>forces in May, 2005.
<br>
<br>-- Salafiya Jihadiya: Formed in the early 1990s by Moroccan
<br>veterans of the anti-Soviet struggle in Afghanistan, Salafiya
<br>Jihadiya supported or inspired many Moroccan jihadists,
<br>including several that worked with the organization in
<br>Morocco and later moved to Spain.
<br>
<br>-- Hizballah: Hizballah (which is not officially recognized
<br>as a terrorist organization by EU countries but is monitored
<br>by the Spanish security services) is believed to have a small
<br>presence in Spain in a fund-raising and logistical capacity.
<br>Spanish officials judge the risk of a Hizballah attack in
<br>Spain to be very low.
<br>
<br>//SHIFTING FACE OF EXTREMISM IN SPAIN//
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Nearly all known or suspected Islamic extremists in
<br>Spain are first-generation immigrants, most of whom have a
<br>history of religious fanaticism in their home countries or a
<br>close personal connection to a Muslim extremist. They are
<br>typically older than extremists in other countries, with the
<br>majority aged 30-40 and very few below the age of 25. As
<br>noted above, many of the first Islamists to take up
<br>activities in Spain had a good education and many had good
<br>jobs and were considered well integrated into Spanish
<br>society. That remains true for many among the second wave of
<br>Spain-based extremists, including Moroccans involved in the
<br>March 11 attacks. However, among North Africans suspected of
<br>involvement in terrorist activity there also many who are
<br>poor or unemployed and many have criminal records for drug
<br>trafficking, robbery, or fraud. The growing pool of
<br>disaffected young North Africans is likely to become the
<br>major recruiting pool for extremist organizers over the
<br>coming years.
<br>
<br>//IDEOLOGY ERASES ORGANIZATIONAL BOUNDARIES//
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Spain-based Islamist extremists are strongly
<br>influenced by the "Takfir Wal Hijra" doctrine, which
<br>justifies the use of illegal proceeds to fund jihadist
<br>operations and accepts non-Muslim practices such as drinking
<br>alcohol and drug trafficking as a cover for extremist
<br>activities. Several of the Madrid train bombers reportedly
<br>followed this doctrine, engaging in drug trafficking and
<br>other criminal activity to finance the March 11, 2004
<br>attacks. At an ideological level, the cells that carried out
<br>the train bombings and other groups seem driven by general
<br>support for the global jihadist cause and by their Salafist
<br>religious beliefs rather than focused on a particular theater
<br>of that struggle.
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) Broad acceptance of these operational and
<br>ideological doctrines among Spain-based extremists promotes a
<br>high degree of cross-fertilization and ad hoc cooperation,
<br>with most organizational, ethnic, and regional differences
<br>subordinated to greater ideological objectives. Family
<br>relationships and friendships are key to recruitment efforts.
<br>Many senior extremist figures are also bound by shared
<br>experience in terrorist training camps in Afghanistan or
<br>elsewhere, or by shared association with highly-regarded
<br>jihadist veterans. Organization names appear unimportant,
<br>with shifting groups of Islamic extremist collaborators
<br>adopting different names for different projects. For
<br>example, members of Barakat Yarkas' Syrian network called
<br>themselves the "Islamic Alliance" and then "Soldiers of
<br>Allah," but never displayed much interest in a particular
<br>name.
<br>
<br>¶15. (S) The decentralization of Spanish Islamic extremists
<br>was clearly seen in the network that carried out the Madrid
<br>train bombings. The group included mainly Moroccans, but
<br>also Algerians, Egyptians, Tunisians and other nationalities
<br>from a variety of extremist organizations. Police believe
<br>that at least three distinct groups came together to carry
<br>out the attacks. One group, based in the Madrid district of
<br>Lavapies, was led by Jamal Zougam, a Moroccan national
<br>resident in Spain and an associate of jailed al-Qa'ida figure
<br>Barakat Yarkas. A second group was directed by Moroccan
<br>national Jamal Ahmidan (AKA "El Chino") from Madrid's
<br>Villaverde district. The third group was led by Sarhane Ben
<br>Abdelmajid Fakhet (AKA Sarhane "The Tunisian") and contained
<br>members of various nationalities. Other actors included
<br>Barakat Yarkas associate Amer Azizi, who remains at large and
<br>is believed to have established the link between the Serhane
<br>and Zougam cells. The various conspirators were brought
<br>together by common associations with Islamic extremist
<br>organizers, intermarriage among their families, and worship
<br>at centers such as Madrid's Villaverde Mosque. The mix of
<br>associations has slowed the progress of the investigation
<br>into the train bombings. Despite having accumulated a mass
<br>of information regarding planning for the bombings, police
<br>remain unable to pinpoint precisely who led the attacks. It
<br>appears likely that there was no single leader, but a
<br>consortium of central actors who organized the plot and
<br>sought specialized assistance as required (for example, for
<br>manufacturing the bombs used in the attacks).
<br>
<br>//DRUG TRAFFICKING - LOW-TECH TERRORIST FINANCING//
<br>
<br>¶16. (S) The March 11, 2004 Madrid train bombings were
<br>financed with the proceeds from drug sales carried out by
<br>Jamal Ahmidan (El Chino) and others. Investigators found
<br>substantial quantities of drug money during searches of the
<br>properties of March 11 plotters and ample evidence linking
<br>low-level drug dealers to the cell that planned and executed
<br>the train bombings. The subsequent arrest of a separate
<br>extremist cell comprised primarily of Moroccans imprisoned on
<br>drug charges, as well as the substantial criminal records of
<br>North African immigrants detained in connection with yet
<br>another network that sent suicide bombers to Iraq, suggest
<br>that drug trafficking has become the primary financing
<br>vehicle for Spain-based jihadists. This trend substantially
<br>expands the pool of persons with possible involvement in
<br>support of Islamic extremist activities and diminishes the
<br>capacity of Spain's financial intelligence unit to use the
<br>formal banking system to track the activities of suspected
<br>jihadists. Mission elements are aware of this danger and
<br>work with police to track drug arrests of North African
<br>suspects. In just the period between April 1 and July 31 of
<br>2005, Spanish police reported 246 arrests of Moroccan
<br>nationals on drug charges, mostly hashish trafficking. Once
<br>in the Spanish prison system, these detainees become a
<br>priority target for Islamic extremist recruiters. With Spain
<br>as the major portal for cocaine and hashish bound for the
<br>Western European market, drug trafficking will likely remain
<br>a lucrative source of funds (and recruits) over the long term
<br>for terrorist groups operating in the country and/or
<br>supporting jihadist causes overseas.
<br>
<br>//THREAT TO U.S. INTERESTS IN SPAIN//
<br>
<br>¶17. (S) Spain-based Islamic terrorist groups target U.S.
<br>interests in the country, at least for surveillance purposes.
<br>The sizable extremist community and insular nature of large
<br>segments of the Muslim immigrant population make it difficult
<br>to monitor against such threats and/or detect them in the
<br>planning stages, but specific threats have been identified in
<br>recent years. Approximately one year before the 2004 Madrid
<br>train bombings, the RSO Surveillance Detection Team
<br>photographed an unidentified subject conducting surveillance
<br>of the Embassy (REF I). During the course of the train
<br>bombing investigation, RSO discovered that the subject
<br>photographed by the detection team was Said Berraj, a key
<br>planner of the train bombings who escaped the Spanish police
<br>sweep and remains at large. Separately, RSO blocked an
<br>attempt by Al-Jazeera journalist Taysir Alouny, who is on
<br>trial for alleged membership in the Barakat Yarkas al-Qa'ida
<br>cell, to enter the November 2004 Embassy election night party
<br>at a Madrid hotel, ostensibly to cover the event as a
<br>journalist. Alouny was out on bail at the time, but was
<br>subsequently re-arrested by Spanish authorities. Mission
<br>personnel believe that the U.S. Embassy likely is a prime
<br>target for Spain-based Islamic terrorists.
<br>
<br>//SPANISH RESPONSE TO ISLAMIC EXTREMISM//
<br>
<br>¶18. (C) Despite Spain's long experience with radical Basque
<br>terrorism and years of monitoring and disrupting Islamic
<br>radical organizations, the March 11, 2004 Madrid train
<br>attacks came as a shock to Spanish security officials. The
<br>GOS has since tripled the number of officials charged with
<br>tracking Islamic extremist activity and ramped up police
<br>operations aimed at disrupting the operations of suspected
<br>terrorist cells. Successes in 2004/2005 include:
<br>
<br>-- "Operation NOVA," October 2004 - Police dismantled a
<br>terrorist ring that was planning to purchase explosives in
<br>order to attack Spain's High Court with a 500 kilogram bomb
<br>(specifically to kill anti-terrorism magistrates) and to bomb
<br>other Madrid landmarks. The group consisted mainly of
<br>Moroccans recruited in Spanish prisons by Algerian national
<br>Abderrahmane Tahiri (better known as "Mohamed Achraf").
<br>
<br>-- Continuing arrests related to the Madrid train bombings,
<br>such as the December 2004 detention of GICM figure Hassan el
<br>Haski and the June 2005 detention of five Moroccan nationals
<br>linked to train bombing conspirator Mohamed Afalah.
<br>
<br>-- "Operation Tigris," June 2005 - The National Police
<br>dismantled a jihadist facilitator network organized to funnel
<br>suicide bombers from Spain to Iraq to undertake actions
<br>against Coalition and Iraqi Government targets. Eight of the
<br>39 suspects detained during the operation were remanded to
<br>prison on terrorism charges, while seven others were
<br>processed for deportation to their countries of origin.
<br>
<br>-- Trial of 24 members of the Barakat Yarkas al-Qa'ida cell,
<br>Spring 2005. A verdict is expected September 20. Spanish
<br>media closely followed the three-month trial and GOS
<br>officials have cited the importance of the prosecution of so
<br>many suspected terrorists. Trial observers note that while
<br>prosecutors provided ample evidence that several of the cell
<br>members had participated in terrorist training activity, they
<br>did not clearly establish a link between the Barakat Yarkas
<br>cell and the 9/11 attacks, as alleged in the indictment.
<br>
<br>¶19. (C) The GOS has worked closely with the USG in improving
<br>its ability to identify, arrest, and prosecute suspected
<br>Islamic extremists. Counterterrorism cooperation is one of
<br>the cornerstones of the bilateral relationship. Attorney
<br>General Gonzales and Justice Minister Aguilar announced the
<br>formation of a Counter Terrorism Experts Working Group in
<br>March 2005 comprised of USG and GOS security officials and
<br>prosecutors. The group met in Madrid in May and will meet in
<br>Washington in late October. Spain's highly-competent
<br>financial intelligence unit, SEPLAC, works very well with the
<br>USG at the bilateral and multilateral level.
<br>
<br>//LINGERING PROBLEMS HINDER CT EFFORTS//
<br>
<br>¶20. (S) There are several continuing problems that undermine
<br>Spain's counterterrorism capabilities. The most troublesome
<br>impediment is strong inter-service rivalry, which blocks the
<br>free flow of information among the Civil Guard, the National
<br>Police (SNP), and the National Center for Intelligence (CNI),
<br>each of which plays a counterterrorism role. By all
<br>accounts, a national counterterrorism center created in 2004
<br>to improve coordination among the services has thus far
<br>failed to achieve its purpose. As a result, there does not
<br>appear to be a consolidated terrorist lookout list shared
<br>among the services. A related problem is the lack of an
<br>electronic namecheck system for customs/immigration officials
<br>to help them identify out persons of interest. Separately,
<br>recent press reports indicate internal frustration with the
<br>head of the SNP's intelligence branch, Telesforo Rubio, whose
<br>leadership style has allegedly led key figures in the SNP
<br>counterterrorism unit to retire or transfer to other units.
<br>
<br>¶21. (C) There are also structural differences between the
<br>U.S. and Spanish legal systems that sometimes interfere with
<br>information sharing, though both sides continue working to
<br>minimize disruption to police investigations. In particular,
<br>the central role of investigating magistrates, such as
<br>Baltasar Garzon and Juan del Olmo, in the Spanish system and
<br>the lack of protections for intelligence information have
<br>complicated the USG's ability to share relevant information
<br>with Spanish authorities. For their part, Spanish
<br>magistrates have sometimes been loathe to share information
<br>controlled under strict judicial secrecy rules.
<br>
<br>//SPAIN FACING LONG STRUGGLE AGAINST ISLAMIC MILITANTS//
<br>
<br>¶22. (C) The combination of an established and growing pool of
<br>extremist sympathizers and Spain's continued identification
<br>with "the West" on the part of those extremists makes it very
<br>likely that Spain will be the target of future terrorist
<br>attacks. The head of the MFA's Bureau of Analysis, Fidel
<br>Sendagorta, expressed concern in a recent article that such
<br>attacks would increase public rejection of North African
<br>immigrants and stir nativist sentiment, which could in turn
<br>alienate young Moroccan immigrants and make them easy targets
<br>for terrorist recruiters. Sendagorta pointed to the problems
<br>faced by the UK, France, and the Netherlands with Islamic
<br>radicalism in their large Muslim immigrant communities as
<br>forerunners of the problems Spain will face over the next ten
<br>to twenty years. Unfortunately, it appears that Spain will
<br>remain an active front in the War on Terror for some time to
<br>come.
