<br>SUBJECT: DEMARCHE ON DEMOCRACY IN VENEZUELA
<br>
<br>REF: A. STATE 154674
<br>¶B. MADRID 2123
<br>¶C. MADRID 2077
<br>
<br>Classified By: CHARGE D'AFFAIRES HUGO LLORENS, REASONS 1.4B AND D.
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Charge d'Affaires delivered ref a demarche November 23
<br>to MFA Secretary of State for Iberoamerica Trinidad Jimenez
<br>and the Director General for Iberoamerica Javier Sandomingo.
<br>Drawing also on information provided by WHA/AND concerning
<br>Chavez' ties to Iran and increased narcotics trafficking from
<br>Venezuela, the Charge urged that Spain continue to speak out
<br>publicly in support of democracy in Venezuela, as FM
<br>Moratinos did when Chavez threatened RCTV.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Jimenez demurred, saying Spain was trying to avoid
<br>being drawn into more public controversy with Chavez
<br>following the King's rebuke (ref b) and despite Chavez'
<br>continued rhetorical provocation. Jimenez said public
<br>opposition from Spain would only help Chavez whip up his
<br>supporters for the constitutional referendum. Pressed by the
<br>Charge to help the EU develop a constructive position,
<br>Jimenez said that Spain would try to do something, but would
<br>want to avoid an appearance of directly interfering in
<br>Venezuela's internal affairs. She said a possibility was to
<br>get a statement at the EU or European Parliament level.
<br>Jimenez also said the Spanish Government was working behind
<br>the scenes, feeding information to journalists on the threat
<br>to democracy in Venezuela.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Jimenez noted that post-Santiago Spain had received
<br>messages of solidarity from virtually every government in
<br>Latin America. She said Chavez (whom she described as a
<br>"clown") was isolated. Alluding to the "Kings' Club" Jimenez
<br>said the Saudis had given Chavez the cold shoulder at the
<br>recent OPEC meeting because of his rudeness to Juan Carlos.
<br>She said even Evo Morales was signaling by his body language
<br>in Santiago that Chavez was embarrassing him.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Jimenez agreed the proposed constitutional reforms
<br>would be a severe setback for democracy and noted that recent
<br>polls suggested that opposition was growing in Venezuelan
<br>society against the proposed changes to the constitution.
<br>She added, however, that it was tough for a government to
<br>lose a referendum and predicted a close vote. Sandomingo
<br>said fraud was a real possibility. Jimenez mentioned she had
<br>met with the opposition during her recent visit to Caracas
<br>(ref c), and although disorganized it was getting better and
<br>finally trying to articulate a position. She also said even
<br>high oil prices could not sustain Chavez' fiscal
<br>irresponsibility; Spanish businessmen and independent
<br>analysts told her an economic collapse was a high possibility
<br>with 24 months.
