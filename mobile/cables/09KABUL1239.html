<br>Valerie C. Fowler for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (U) Summary: A recent trip to the northeast by a
<br>representative of the Embassy's Provincial Reconstruction
<br>Team-Sub-National Governance team confirmed the presence
<br>there of a number of the same challenges thwarting progress
<br>elsewhere in Afghanistan. It also served to dispel a few
<br>misconceptions about the region. Among the challenges are
<br>poor governance and corruption. Among the misconceptions
<br>dispelled are the notions that there are only negligible
<br>security issues in the northeast and that development
<br>assistance, particularly from the Germans, is readily
<br>available to address the most pressing needs. In fact, there
<br>appears to be a genuine threat to future ISAF resupply
<br>convoys through Kunduz. As far as development aid is
<br>concerned, Germans on the ground are frustrated by the limits
<br>and constraints under which they have to operate; and funds
<br>available from the Hungarians in Baghlan province provide
<br>only a drop of help in a desert of need. End Summary.
<br>
<br>Security: More Dangers than Sometimes Assumed
<br>--------------------------------------------- -
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) The fact that the PRT came under RPG attack
<br>during Emboff's visit risked coloring his impressions
<br>regarding security in the northeast; but in fact, there do
<br>appear to be some serious security issues needing to be
<br>addressed. Clearly the most compelling is the festering
<br>situation in Chahar Darrah district in Kunduz. It is a bit
<br>unnerving to realize that villages literally a stone's throw
<br>from the main north-south road linking Kabul to the border
<br>crossing with Tajikistan at Sherkan-Bandar are in a security
<br>no-go area owing to the presence there of insurgent elements.
<br>This is hardly an abstract concern, given increased
<br>prospects of ISAF using the road as an important resupply
<br>route. A joint ANSF/German operation in the district from
<br>late December to mid-January managed to expel mid-level
<br>insurgent commanders and suppress low-level fighters. Key
<br>leaders, however, have been moving back into the district and
<br>the PRT in Kunduz is expecting the worst this summer. As the
<br>then-PRT commander reasoned in late March, the Taliban feel a
<br>need to surge in order to demonstrate their reach, especially
<br>in light of the influx of additional U.S. troops to
<br>Afghanistan.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Rocket attacks on the PRT and a rise in IED
<br>incidents in the area are seen as a harbinger of things to
<br>come. The same German commander (the position shifts every
<br>six months) was more rigorous than some of his predecessors
<br>in addressing the insurgent threat, sending his soldiers to
<br>patrol in Chahar Darrah even at night. But he expressed
<br>frustration at the unwieldiness of the German interagency
<br>bureaucracy in Berlin that left the PRT unable to move
<br>forward quickly with job- and income-generating projects in
<br>Chahar Darrah at a time when, he felt, such activities could
<br>have helped cement gains made in the December-January
<br>operation. The increased pace of insurgent attacks in and
<br>around Kunduz since that commander's departure have confirmed
<br>his worrying predictions. Whether more PRT projects could
<br>have prevented the ongoing security downturn in Chahar Darrah
<br>is hard to say. The commander himself noted the embarrassed
<br>reaction of local residents there at the time of the earlier
<br>operation over the New Year period. People told the Germans
<br>they were ashamed that international forces had had to come
<br>to help -- that Afghan authorities were not paying heed to
<br>their calls for help and that Afghans themselves should have
<br>been able to address the situation.
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) Kunduz Governor Omar shares the former PRT
<br>commander's view on the fundamental source of the security
<br>problem, namely the lack of jobs. Equally important in his
<br>view, however, is the absence of a functioning legal system
<br>capable of dispensing real punishment to malefactors. He
<br>estimates the number of active insurgents in the province as
<br>between 150-200 and also anticipates an upsurge in attacks
<br>this year, as both Taliban and Hizb-e Islami seek to increase
<br>instability for the elections and demonstrate they can and do
<br>remain an active threat in the North. The governor further
<br>shares the assessment that insurgents are likely to target
<br>the expected increase in ISAF resupply convoys transiting the
<br>province. He bemoans what he sees as the squandering of
<br>earlier popular support for the government as a result of the
<br>government's own inability/failure to act decisively in the
<br>area. He suggests poppy cultivation was left unchallenged
<br>for too long, the disbandment of illegal armed groups was not
<br>pursued with enough vigor and ministries have failed to
<br>coordinate among themselves or mount effective programs.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Further to the south, ostensibly peaceful Baghlan
<br>
<br>Kabul 00001239 002.5 of 005
<br>
<br>
<br>Province faces a different set of security challenges. As
<br>the head of the UNAMA office for the region tells it, even
<br>though Baghlan generally flies under the national radar, it
<br>actually deserves to be labeled "the wild, wild west."
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx, behind-the-scenes
<br>contests for power (including on the part of the provincial
<br>chief of police); the influence of local strongmen and former
<br>mujahedeen (particularly in northern Baghlan); unchecked
<br>poppy cultivation in Andarab district; underlying
<br>Tajik-Pashtun tensions; and criminality all combine to
<br>undermine stability. Direct insurgent activity appears
<br>limited, but criminal elements have fashioned links to the
<br>Taliban. Locals have also made themselves available to
<br>execute for-hire insurgent missions. The Hungarian PRT does
<br>little to address any of these problems. They are not
<br>permitted to fire their weapons except in self-defense, do
<br>little more than patrol the main roads and undertake no
<br>counter-narcotics activities. When two Hungarian de-miners
<br>were killed doing their work, Budapest stopped sending mine
<br>clearers to the PRT. When the security situation in
<br>northeastern Bamyan Province was threatened by Baghlan-based
<br>malefactors, it was the New Zealanders who had to cross into
<br>Baghlan to address the problem. The PRT sees itself as
<br>focused on humanitarian assistance and small-scale
<br>development work. Again xxxxxxxxxxxx,
<br>his nation's troops are looking to do their short stints in
<br>Afghanistan and get back home unscathed.
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) The head of the Provincial Council (PC) in
<br>Baghlan sees one of the same factors cited by Governor Omar
<br>in Kunduz as undermining stability in his province too )
<br>namely the inability of the nascent formal legal system to
<br>address people,s need for justice. In fact, he claims as
<br>one of his PC's singular achievements its intervention to
<br>settle legal disputes that the formal legal system failed to
<br>resolve in a timely manner. According to the PC chairman,
<br>one dispute over a murder had languished for 10 years but was
<br>settled in two days once a Council member from the affected
<br>district mediated. Another case involving a tribal killing
<br>had been with prosecutors and the court for 18 months but was
<br>settled in two hours with the Provincial Council's help. It
<br>is questionable whether these cases were in fact "resolved"
<br>in a way that met formal justice standards, but it is
<br>noteworthy that these elected sub-national governance
<br>officials clearly believe they have done a service to their
<br>constituents and thereby brought the government and people
<br>closer by their actions.
<br>
<br>Governance ) A Weak Reed
<br>-------------------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) The governors in Kunduz and Takhar provinces are
<br>hardly among the country's strongest. While Kunduz Governor
<br>Omar certainly talks a good game, the Germans see him as so
<br>thoroughly corrupt that they avoid all contact with him to
<br>the furthest extent possible. This can hardly make for
<br>optimal synchronization of security, governance and
<br>development efforts. The PRT insists, however, that to be
<br>seen working with the governor would seriously taint them in
<br>the eyes of local residents. As a case in point, they
<br>suggest their efforts to construct a bridge across the Kunduz
<br>River into Chahar Darrah district (an obvious security
<br>priority) have been stalled not least because of the
<br>governor's shady dealings with the government land needed for
<br>access to the site of the bridge crossing (the Germans also
<br>say they had to re-bid the construction contract for the
<br>bridge to enable a firm favored by a deputy minister at the
<br>Ministry of Reconstruction and Development (MRRD) to come out
<br>the winner). Governor Omar himself places a finger of blame
<br>on the poor quality of some of his district administrators.
<br>In other instance, however, he suggests the Independent
<br>Director of Local Governance,s (IDLG) emphasis on education
<br>qualifications has saddled districts with officials ignorant
<br>of the important local social networks and power
<br>relationships. He complains as well about his lack of funds
<br>and argues that the inability of some line ministries in
<br>Kunduz to spend their full allocations from Kabul exacerbates
<br>the problem. The Kunduz PRT's German development advisor had
<br>high praise for the activities of USAID's Local Governance
<br>and Community Development (LGCD) program in the province but
<br>noted the lack of a civil service training institute in
<br>Kunduz, the most important city in the northeast.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) While Takhar Governor Ibrahimi may check the Uzbek
<br>ethnic box, he appears to have little else going for him, at
<br>least judging by a desultory 90-minute meeting he gave to
<br>Emboff. Despite evidence to the contrary, according to the
<br>governor his province has virtually no major challenges,
<br>aside from the inadequacy of international development
<br>
<br>Kabul 00001239 003.2 of 005
<br>
<br>
<br>assistance. He suggested that, thanks to his own efforts as
<br>well as those of NDS and ANP and the cooperation of local
<br>elders and religious leaders, security in the province is
<br>good and insurgents are "under control;" weapons have been
<br>surrendered in fully half of the province's districts; women
<br>play an active role, including in government service; the
<br>Governor makes special efforts to press district
<br>administrators working under him to respect human rights; and
<br>anti-corruption efforts are underway. He dismissed reports
<br>of weapons smuggling through the province as inaccurate and
<br>blamed what he admitted is some heroin and opium smuggling on
<br>the existence of an active drug market across Takhar's border
<br>in Tajikistan. According to the German PRT in Kunduz,
<br>Ibrahimi's extortion schemes are netting him $40,000 a month
<br>from Takhar residents.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) If there is a bright spot in governance in the
<br>northeast, it may be Governor Barakzai in Baghlan. While it
<br>is still early days, xxxxxxxxxxxx sees Barakzai as a breath of fresh air. While the
<br>provincial chief of police reportedly ran roughshod over
<br>Barakzai's predecessor, the new governor has put the ANP
<br>chief off balance (it may help that Barakzai brought with him
<br>to Baglan his own bodyguard force). For the moment, the
<br>governor appears to have co-opted the police chief as well as
<br>the local NDS head, is gaining in prestige among the local
<br>movers and shakers and has even gone some distance in
<br>quieting unease among the province's large Tajik population
<br>over his appointment (he is a Pashtun).
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Comments by some key international stakeholders
<br>raise doubts that UNAMA's local operations are likely to
<br>contribute much to turning around the situation on governance
<br>in the region. The German PRT in Kunduz reports that the
<br>local UNAMA office has little to offer, in contrast to
<br>UNAMA's facility in Maza-I Sharif. As the PRT sees it,
<br>UNAMA's Kunduz office does not coordinate or align donors,
<br>has no humanitarian assistance officer and has failed so far
<br>to provide much needed district mapping for Chahar Darrah
<br>district. In Baghlan, where UNAMA placed three people late
<br>last year, xxxxxxxxxxxx goes so far as to label
<br>UNAMA's role in the province "just a joke." He takes aim
<br>particularly at what he suggests is a failure by local UNAMA
<br>staff to exercise a coordinating role. In UNAMA's defense,
<br>the head of UNAMA's regional office in Kunduz notes that
<br>personnel reinforcements are in the pipeline. She points in
<br>particular to the upcoming addition of a governance unit,
<br>with two additional international staffers.
<br>
<br>Development: No Pockets are Deep Enough
<br>-----------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶11. (U) Three of the four provinces of the northeast enjoy
<br>something of an advantage in having as their "patron" the
<br>Germans, who see their mission as development-focused.
<br>Germany currently channels 130 million euros a year in
<br>assistance to Afghanistan, with 60 percent of this going to
<br>the three provinces of Kunduz, Takhar and Badakhshan, as well
<br>as to Balkh (home of the German-led Regional Command North).
<br>Of those three northeastern provinces, Badakhshan receives
<br>the largest share because of its greater needs. The Kunduz
<br>corridor also comes in for a fair share of the funding, with
<br>Takhar receiving the least. The German Development Agency
<br>(GTZ) does, however, maintain an office in Taloqan, Takhar's
<br>capital. The Germans are seriously considering
<br>rehabilitating and paving the direct road link between Kunduz
<br>and Mazar-e Sharif over the next few years, at an estimated
<br>cost of 54 million euros for the 60-mile stretch. They were
<br>instrumental in getting EC funding for the rehabilitation of
<br>the major irrigation system along the Taloqan River in Takhar
<br>and are putting 1.6 million euros into repairing the adjacent
<br>Khanabad I power station (damaged in the war).
<br>
<br>¶12. (U) Such large-scale projects, rather than the quick
<br>impact projects that were once a staple of the German PRT in
<br>Kunduz, are sought increasingly by the local population. But
<br>even for smaller projects, the PRT has tried to better target
<br>local desires and needs by establishing a special Provincial
<br>Development Fund (PDF). Each of the three provinces in the
<br>PRT's area of responsibility is awarded 800,000 euros a year
<br>in projects approved by an eight-member panel composed of
<br>four Germans and four Afghans, including representative from
<br>the respective Provincial Councils and governors' offices.
<br>
<br>¶13. (SBU) Despite their best efforts, the Germans in the
<br>field in the northeast are frustrated by the cumbersomeness
<br>of their own government bureaucracy. As the Kunduz DEVAD
<br>explains it, back in 2003 the Berlin ministries with a stake
<br>in development assistance worked out an agreement defining
<br>the specific sectors to which assistance would be directed.
<br>
<br>Kabul 00001239 004.4 of 005
<br>
<br>
<br>These include such areas as drinking water supply, basic
<br>education, gender, renewable energy and provision of
<br>technical cooperation and advice. The list did not include a
<br>sector that is key in this relatively well-watered region,
<br>namely agriculture; and this has come to hamper the
<br>effectiveness of the overall effort of the PRT. It appears
<br>all but impossible to have the basic list of priority sectors
<br>reexamined, given the existing balance of interests between
<br>the various German ministries. This makes it extremely
<br>difficult for the PRT to respond to evolving, sometimes
<br>pressing needs. This year, in what they consider a major
<br>victory, the PRT managed to extract 500,000 euros in extra
<br>funding from the German Foreign Ministry and the German Bank
<br>for Reconstruction and Development (KFW) for urgently needed
<br>projects in Chahar Darrah. None of this assistance, however,
<br>keeps local authorities from complaining, sometimes bitterly,
<br>about their neglect ) particularly relative to what they see
<br>as truly massive aid being channeled to the country,s east
<br>and south.
<br>
<br>¶14. (U) Baghlan falls into that unfortunate category of
<br>provinces stuck with the fatal combination of a fairly benign
<br>environment and a fairly indigent PRT. The result is minimal
<br>international development assistance. The Hungarians spend
<br>about $30 million a year to maintain their PRT outpost. They
<br>invest another $3 million a year in development assistance,
<br>with $300,000 directed at infrastructure improvements (the
<br>section of the Ring Road in the province south of Pol-i
<br>Khumri is still unpaved). The PRT has a budget of $500,000
<br>for civ-mil quick impact projects. The NGO Hungarian
<br>Interchurch Aid (HIA) serves as implementer for much of
<br>Hungary's aid.
<br>
<br>Self-Sacrifice a Lost Virtue? Yes and No
<br>-------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶15. (U) A visit to the Baghlan sugar refinery just north
<br>of the provincial capital provided a window on the challenges
<br>of reviving what little industry or processing capabilities
<br>the country still possesses. The mill, which ran from 1929
<br>until 1976 as a private concern, suffered like the rest of
<br>the country from decades of war but was reopened in 2005
<br>after being reborn as a private-public partnership. The
<br>enterprise was capitalized at 15.6 million euros, with the
<br>Afghan government holding a 30 percent stake and the
<br>remainder in the hands of two German companies and four local
<br>Afghans. The refinery first produced sugar again in 2006,
<br>but its potential has been difficult to realize because of a
<br>local roundworm infestation that originated in the former
<br>Soviet Union and now covers all of Baghlan. In that year
<br>fully 70 percent of the harvest was lost to the infestation.
<br>The following year no beets were grown, and in 2008 only 40
<br>hectares of the 260 hectares planted survived. And this was
<br>only due to some farmers having planted beets as their second
<br>crop ) the worms did not have the entire season to do their
<br>damage. xxxxxxxxxxxx this is a tragedy for the country since it is
<br>currently importing sugar at a cost of $450 million a year.
<br>A possible solution would be to allow fields to lie fallow
<br>for a time, but xxxxxxxxxxxx has been unable to convince farmers to
<br>follow his advice.
<br>
<br>¶16. (SBU) Roundworm is not the only challenge facing he
<br>refinery. It was, notoriously, the site of an explosive
<br>attack in November 2007 that resulted in death and injury to
<br>as many as 75 people, including women and children. A
<br>six-member delegation from the Wolesi Jirga's economics
<br>committee died in the incident. Although the German
<br>development agency (GTZ) does not generally support
<br>agricultural projects in Afghanistan, it did come up with the
<br>funds to make extensive security improvements to the
<br>office/residence complex at the mill. xxxxxxxxxxxx a
<br>continuing threat of kidnapping. xxxxxxxxxxxx has also had to hire
<br>a local strongman as his assistant to run interference for
<br>him with locals seeking to extort this or that advantage for
<br>themselves from the plant.
<br>
<br>¶17. (U) The problem of locals seeking immediate, personal
<br>gain is not confined to the mill. xxxxxxxxxxxx recounts it, the
<br>well-known cheese factory across the street from his mill
<br>gave local farmers dairy cows to help ensure the factory
<br>would have a steady supply of milk. Much to the annoyance of
<br>the managers of that plant, many of the farmers instead sold
<br>the animals. xxxxxxxxxxxx complains further that farmers have
<br>demanded $4000 from the mill to clear their own irrigation
<br>canals, something they traditionally have done for
<br>themselves. xxxxxxxxxxxx suggests a simple assessment of $2 per
<br>head among the farmers would get the job done.
<br>
<br>¶18. (U) Elsewhere enlightened self-interest still has a
<br>
<br>Kabul 00001239 005.2 of 005
<br>
<br>
<br>place. At least this is what is reported by the Louis Berger
<br>Group (LBG) project managers guiding the USAID-funded
<br>construction of the 60-mile engineering marvel that is the
<br>Feyzabad-to-Kishim highway through the Hindu Kush in
<br>Badakhshan Province. This massive $120-130 million
<br>undertaking is forcing a 30-meter wide highway alongside the
<br>Mashhad River by means of major hill-leveling and blasting
<br>works. If the Germans ultimately do decide to rebuild the
<br>direct road between Kunduz and Mazar-e Sharif, then an
<br>improved asphalt band will link people and commerce across
<br>the entire north of Afghanistan, from Feyzabad in the east to
<br>Sherberghan and Meymaneh in the west. While government and
<br>security officials at all levels in Badakhshan have been
<br>quite supportive of USAID,s project, the LBG engineers are
<br>especially impressed by the readiness of farmers along the
<br>route to give up a significant part of their extremely
<br>limited mountainside acreage for the sake of the road.
<br>Although GIRoA is supposed to pay compensation, project
<br>managers doubt this is actually happening. The company
<br>maintains two community development offices to work as
<br>liaisons with local residents and has tried to be
<br>accommodating, for example by allowing time for harvesting of
<br>targeted fields and by rerouting of affected irrigation
<br>channels. They marvel nonetheless at the goodwill they have
<br>encountered despite the destruction of 400-500 houses, many
<br>of which have been dismantled by the residents themselves.
<br>
<br>¶19. (U) The on-site project managers point to one other
<br>important advantage they enjoy ) good security. They had
<br>some IEDs and rockets to deal with last year, but things are
<br>going well now. Without good security, they say, it would be
<br>impossible to build the road through the area's mountainous
<br>terrain where they and their crews are often dwarfed by still
<br>higher ground above them. The NDS licenses their protection
<br>teams, who are made up basically of the troops of local
<br>commanders. Another advantage of good security is their
<br>ability to find willing Afghan subcontractors. Some of these
<br>firms once worked in the southeast and reinvested their
<br>earnings in the purchase of expensive road construction
<br>equipment. Those Afghan businessmen are reluctant to work
<br>again in those now more insecure areas for fear of losing
<br>their equipment to insurgent attack.
