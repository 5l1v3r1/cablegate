<br>4(b) and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: A/S Shannon's January 8-9 Madrid program
<br>and subsequent media play were characterized by bilateral
<br>goodwill and Spanish optimism for a new phase in U.S.-Spanish
<br>cooperation in Latin America despite significant challenges
<br>in the region. He highlighted U.S. engagement in the
<br>Americas, shared interests with Spain, and our outreach in
<br>Europe and Asia to countries with strategic interests in
<br>Latin America and the Caribbean. The Spanish also raised
<br>Gaza and the High-Level Meeting on Food Security taking place
<br>in Madrid later this month. END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>U.S., Spain, and Europe in Latin America
<br>----------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Spanish Secretary of State for Iberoamerica Trinidad
<br>Jimenez hosted a lunch for A/S Shannon January 8. The
<br>conversational tour of the region set the stage for the
<br>remainder of A/S Shannon's interactions, notably the
<br>breakfast colloquium January 9 at Casa de America and a
<br>90-minute meeting with Secretary General of the Presidency
<br>Bernardino Leon, also January 9. At lunch and again before a
<br>public audience, Jimenez asserted that no two countries were
<br>more important to the future success of Latin America than
<br>the U.S. and Spain. She reviewed recent Spanish involvement
<br>in the region (Note: In what the press has called an effort
<br>to promote a closer relationship between Europe and Latin
<br>America, Jimenez traveled to Lisbon on January 13 and met
<br>with Portuguese FM Amado and the Secretary of State for
<br>Foreign Affairs and Cooperation. She also received her
<br>Italian counterpart in Madrid on January 14. End note.)
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) During his meeting with A/S Shannon, Leon suggested
<br>the Western Hemisphere was becoming more "global." Leon
<br>cited the expulsion of Israel's ambassador by Venezuelan
<br>President Chavez and Nicaragua's September 2008 recognition
<br>of the breakaway Georgian republics of South Ossetia and
<br>Abkhazia. Leon also expressed interest in the approach the
<br>new U.S. Administration would take to the region and offered
<br>GOS assistance during the transition. Leon said
<br>President-elect Obama had expressed his desire to consult
<br>with Spanish President Zapatero before making any big
<br>decisions on Latin America policy. (Note: In a January 13
<br>radio interview Zapatero said he "hoped to have a deep
<br>conversation (with Obama) as soon as possible about conflict
<br>areas, as well as about Latin America, including Cuba," but
<br>that the contacts would start after January 20. End note.)
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) A/S Shannon told Leon that during the Secretary's
<br>December 2008 trip to Panama for the first Pathways to
<br>Prosperity plenary, the U.S. had made efforts to engage with
<br>all countries in the region that had expressed interest in
<br>free trade. Leon raised the EU accords with Central America
<br>and Colombia. He lamented that Bolivia would likely be
<br>excluded due to the negative influence of Venezuela.
<br>Ecuador, he surmised, would want in on any trade agreement in
<br>order to protect banana exports.
<br>
<br>MEXICO AND BRAZIL
<br>-----------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Jimenez praised the U.S. for focusing attention on
<br>Mexico's border with Guatemala. Hearing that President-elect
<br>Obama would meet with Mexican President Calderon January 12,
<br>she called it a good initiative to form new institutional
<br>relationships. She expressed concern about Calderon's
<br>capacity to fight corruption within his government but noted
<br>
<br>the widespread respect he commanded in the region.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Leon and Jimenez were very upbeat about Brazil.
<br>Regarding Lula's efforts on behalf of regional integration,
<br>
<br>Jimenez assured Shannon, "if it is good for Latin America, it
<br>is good for Spain." She suggested Spain and the U.S. should
<br>see each other and also Brazil and Mexico as partners rather
<br>than rivals. Discarding the idea that the U.S. had been
<br>excluded from December meetings in Sauipe, Shannon praised
<br>Lula's leadership and quoted the Secretary as calling Brazil
<br>"a regional power and a global partner." Jimenez was also
<br>supportive of "a strong Brazil and an involved Mexico."
<br>
<br>CENTRAL AMERCIA
<br>---------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) On Guatemala, both Jimenez and Leon expressed
<br>disappointment with Colom's slowness in recognizing and
<br>confronting the problems of corruption and organized crime.
<br>Jimenez told A/S Shannon she would travel to Guatemala soon
<br>to address concerns over insecurity and drug violence. She
<br>said Spain would also add an Interior Ministry representative
<br>to its embassy in Guatemala to support the Spanish Civil
<br>Guard's work in training Guatemalan national police. Leon
<br>noted the Guatemalan President had invited two Spanish
<br>advisors from the Office of the Presidency and suggested they
<br>should make contact with the U.S. Embassy there to exchange
<br>views. Leon was generally optimistic about Costa Rica, and
<br>opined that El Salvador would be okay following March 15
<br>presidential elections, but noted it would be better if ARENA
<br>won. Leon described Nicaraguan President Ortega as a "lost
<br>cause." He said Zapatero had refused to meet with Ortega
<br>during the October 2008 Latin American Summit in El Salvador.
<br>Jimenez called Ortega the worst of all the leaders with whom
<br>she works.
<br>
<br>SOUTHERN CONE
<br>-------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Leon told Shannon the GOS supports the Marsans Group
<br>in its dispute with Aerolineas Argentinas but said Spain
<br>would take measures to improve the climate before the
<br>February 8 visit to Madrid of Argentine President Fernandez
<br>de Kirchner. Shannon said the U.S. had made enormous efforts
<br>to maintain a good relationship with Argentina, with mixed
<br>results. Leon agreed the Kirchner team was "lamentable," and
<br>doubted Argentina's "perverse system" could be fixed, yet he
<br>expressed hope that Argentines would one day reclaim their
<br>political space. He offered to deliver any messages the U.S.
<br>might wish during Fernandez Kirchner's February visit. Leon
<br>said Spain was not worried about the outcome of Chilean
<br>elections, but expressed disappointment in Paraguayan
<br>President Lugo.
<br>
<br>ANDES
<br>-----
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Leon noted Ecuador's need to be more competitive to
<br>make up for the loss of its oil income. Saying he was
<br>hopeful about Ecuadorian President Correa, he conceded his
<br>first impression, at the time of Ecuador's expropriation of
<br>foreign oil companies, had been decidedly negative. He
<br>observed Correa continued to manipulate debt and market
<br>access issues for his own political gain, and he opined the
<br>Ecuadorian President needed a positive "mentor" in the
<br>region.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Referring to Ecuador's March 2008 border conflict
<br>with Colombia and Correa's subsequent European tour, Leon
<br>expressed lingering frustration with Correa's propensity to
<br>express "barbarities" after a carefully managed and very
<br>moderate joint statement with President Zapatero. In the
<br>context of balancing Colombian concerns, Leon mentioned
<br>Ecuador's request for assistance with air traffic control
<br>radar. Leon and A/S Shannon agreed that improved civil
<br>aviation control was essential to ensure regional stability
<br>in the Andean corridor. Jimenez deemed Venezuelan President
<br>Chavez to be weakened, as evidenced by moving up the
<br>Venezuelan referendum.
<br>
<br>CUBA
<br>
<br>----
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) In his conversations with both Jimenez and Leon, A/S
<br>Shannon noted Cuba's long resistance to democratic change,
<br>and said the U.S., Spain, and other countries must continue
<br>to promote such change, pressing consistently for freedom for
<br>political prisoners and political space for a democratic
<br>opposition. Jimenez mentioned the difficulties of
<br>negotiating with the GOC, as in the case of humanitarian aid
<br>offers in the wake of hurricanes Ike and Gustav, but insisted
<br>it was important to make such gestures even if Cuba
<br>ultimately refused them. Anticipating the third round of
<br>EU-Cuba human rights talks January 15-16, Jimenez said the
<br>Czechs (holding the EU Presidency) did not appear interested
<br>in sending messages. Spain, on the other hand, wanted to
<br>find the "right formula," presumably not a public one, to
<br>speak of pluralism and to visit dissidents. Jimenez said she
<br>might travel to Cuba in May 2009 and joked that, looking to
<br>the June review of the EU's common position on Cuba, the U.S.
<br>ought to give the Czechs instructions that would be helpful
<br>to Spain's efforts. Jimenez expounded on what she called the
<br>discrepancies between Miami and Washington approaches to Cuba
<br>and argued that the U.S. transition was "the best excuse" for
<br>a change in U.S. policy.
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Leon asked A/S Shannon to convey Spain's intention to
<br>work closely with the U.S. on any possible Spanish
<br>presidential visit to Cuba. He did not discard the
<br>possibility Zapatero could travel to Cuba in 2009, but he
<br>noted Zapatero had backtracked following conflicting public
<br>statements by GOS officials. Jimenez retreated further,
<br>saying perhaps Zapatero would not visit in 2009 but that a
<br>visit would be reasonable during this legislature (which ends
<br>in 2012) if it could help promote change in Cuba.
<br>
<br>AREAS FOR COOPERATION
<br>--------------------
<br>
<br>¶13. (SBU) Leon asked about the prospects for extending the
<br>Merida Initiative to Central America. A/S Shannon said that
<br>$60 million in funding from the first tranche of $465 million
<br>was slated for Central America. An additional $150 million
<br>was requested for Central America in the FY-2009 budget
<br>request. Director General of Cooperation with Iberoamerica
<br>Consuelo Femenia joined Jimenez' lunch for A/S Shannon and
<br>briefed on Spain's assistance programs in the hemisphere.
<br>Femenia spoke of Spanish emphasis on governability, gender
<br>issues, and the health sector and noted the importance of
<br>continuity of development aid in countries like Bolivia,
<br>where Spain's bilateral plans are in limbo. While Jimenez
<br>said Spain had not restricted cooperation to Bolivia, the GOS
<br>was conscious of the need to make assistance more
<br>"efficient." To that end, lunch attendees espoused the
<br>benefits of triangular cooperation. A/S Shannon called for
<br>increased coherence among assistance programs. He suggested
<br>the U.S. and Spain review opportunities for triangular
<br>cooperation.
<br>
<br>GAZA AND FOOD SECURITY
<br>----------------------
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) Gaza crept into discussions of Latin America. Leon
<br>described FM Moratinos's planned trip the week of January 12
<br>to Egypt, Israel, Syria, and the West Bank. A/S Shannon
<br>encouraged Leon to stay in touch with U.S. officials on the
<br>Middle East to maintain an exchange of views (Note:
<br>Moratinos reached out the Secretary by telephone January 15
<br>to describe his trip. End note). Leon also pulled A/S
<br>Shannon aside to stress the importance to the GOS attaches to
<br>the UN High-Level Meeting on Food Security in Madrid January
<br>26-27.
<br>
<br>CASA DE AMERICA
<br>---------------
<br>
<br>¶15. (U) A/S Shannon and Jimenez drew a standing-room only
<br>crowd for an on the record breakfast colloquium January 9 at
<br>
<br>Casa de America (the Spanish Government's influential
<br>cultural institute for Latin America). A/S Shannon spoke of
<br>seeking new partners and opening new space for democracy and
<br>economic opportunity in Latin America. He noted the U.S. and
<br>Spain shared a strategic vision in the region. He
<br>acknowledged that Spain and the U.S. might differ on tactics
<br>in some cases but emphasized shared goals. He stressed the
<br>need to work not just with Latin American countries but with
<br>all countries who have strategic interests in the region.
<br>Asked whether 2009 would be the year of Cuba, Jimenez
<br>expressed hope for a change of U.S. attitude but commented
<br>the future of the embargo depended on gestures from both
<br>sides. A/S Shannon in turn insisted on the importance of the
<br>international community actively promoting democratic change.
<br>He emphasized it was more than just meeting dissidents
<br>during visits to the island, important though that was.
<br>Countries needed to work collaboratively and consistently
<br>with the dissidents to help them create space for a
<br>democratic opposition.
<br>
<br>MEDIA HOMERUNS
<br>--------------
<br>
<br>¶16. (U) A/S Shannon granted interviews to the three leading
<br>media outlets. Left-of-center daily El Pais (circulation 2.2
<br>million), published a full page interview January 11. A/S
<br>Shannon participated in the live broadcast Cadena Ser Radio
<br>program "La Ventana" (average listenership 750,000).
<br>Number-one ranked Television Espanola (TVE) recorded an
<br>interview with A/S Shannon for its regular program "Barrio
<br>Latino." The show will air January 20 and will reach
<br>audiences throughout Spain and Latin America on January 20.
<br>In each interview, A/S Shannon laid out U.S. policy in Latin
<br>America and strongly defended the USG's engagement with the
<br>region in recent years. Topics of particular interest to the
<br>media included U.S. policy towards Cuba and Venezuela,
<br>prospects for trade and investment in the region given the
<br>economic crisis, drug trafficking and the Merida Initiative,
<br>and the perceived rise of leftist/populist leaders in several
<br>Latin American countries. Leading journalists and directors
<br>of Spanish news wire service EFE also participated in the
<br>colloquium January 9.
<br>
<br>COMMENT
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶17. (C) Spanish views continue to resonate with our own on
<br>most things Latin American. The GOS expresses frustration
<br>with the same leaders and situations that are of greatest
<br>concern to us. On Cuba, where we have our greatest tactical
<br>differences, Spain is watching closely for signals from the
<br>new U.S. Administration and hopes to consult closely on the
<br>issue. Throughout the Western Hemisphere, Spain seems
<br>genuinely interested in working with the U.S., and the Merida
<br>Initiative may present a unique opportunity to do so if we
<br>can move beyond Spanish good intentions to concrete actions.
<br>The Spanish are increasingly aware that many of Latin
<br>America's ills, such as narcotics trafficking, impact them as
<br>much or more than the U.S. A/S Shannon's visit was an
<br>extremely well-timed and typically effective push in the
<br>right direction. For historical and cultural reasons, Spain
<br>likes to regard Latin America as something of a special
<br>preserve and itself as the opinion leader within Europe.
<br>Nevertheless, Spanish officials such as Leon and Jimenez are
<br>keenly aware of the preponderant U.S. influence in the region
<br>and are anxious to maintain the fluid dialogue that has been
<br>established in recent years. The Zapatero Administration is
<br>likely to maintain its preference for low key diplomacy in
<br>dealing with problem countries in Latin America, but that is
<br>not say we cannot have a mutually-beneficial partnership in
<br>the region.
<br>
<br>¶18. (U) A/S Shannon cleared this cable.
