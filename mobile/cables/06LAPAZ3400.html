<br>------- 
<br>SUMMARY 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Evo Morales' election in December 2005 was a political 
<br>earthquake in Bolivia, sweeping aside political expectations 
<br>that have defined Bolivian politics for generations and at 
<br>the same time breaking open fissures and offering up new 
<br>possibilities. While President Morales' popularity has risen 
<br>and fallen since his election, his popularity has surged 
<br>since the hydrocarbons nationalization and his successful use 
<br>of political hardball tactics to overcome an 
<br>opposition-imposed blockade of the senate. For now, the 
<br>traditional opposition appears to be crumbling under the 
<br>GOB's pressure. While it is too early to discern the final 
<br>shifts of Bolivia's political tectonic plates this cable is 
<br>an effort to explore the new political geography of current 
<br>and potentially future leaders of the country. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>----------------------------- 
<br>INDIGENOUS & REGIONAL LEADERS 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) RENE JOAQUINO CABRERA: A mason by trade, Potosi Mayor 
<br>Rene Joaquino Cabrera is an emerging politician known for 
<br>competent management, reported honesty, and efforts to govern 
<br>transparently. Despite a low public profile, Joaquino has 
<br>been involved in politics since 1993 and has twice been 
<br>elected mayor of Potosi. His political group, the Social 
<br>Alliance of the People, has earned a reputation of acting 
<br>independently and moderately to build consensus within 
<br>Bolivia's Constituent Assembly (CA). However, Joaquino does 
<br>not have the name recognition or funding necessary for a 
<br>national campaign. Given the number of potential candidates 
<br>for the next presidential race, there may not be enough 
<br>political space for Joaquino to make a convincing bid for 
<br>national office. Despite these challenges to Joaquino's 
<br>emergence nationally, his indigenous background and personal 
<br>biography as a former child laborer in the country's mines 
<br>could galvanize popular support. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) OSCAR GERARDO MONTES: A member of the Movement of the 
<br>Revolutionary Left (MIR) party, Tarija Mayor Oscar Montes is 
<br>an intelligent strategist who understands the realities that 
<br>the political opposition faces in Bolivia's current political 
<br>climate. With a wealth of political experience that includes 
<br>positions within national and local government, Montes has 
<br>regional name recognition within Tarija and enjoys a good 
<br>reputation. Understanding the political chasm that separates 
<br>the country's eastern and western regions, Montes has 
<br>expressed interest in creating a politically viable 
<br>alternative to the MAS that includes an alliance among 
<br>Bolivia's southern-most departments (Chuquisaca, Potosi, 
<br>Ouro, and Tarija). He is politically aligned with Joaquino 
<br>(see above). Poloffs believe a national ticket featuring 
<br>Joaquino as the presidential candidate and Montes as the 
<br>candidate for vice-president could empower Bolivia's southern 
<br>departments and garner wide national support. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) PEDRO TICANA: Former minister of indigenous affairs 
<br>under the Mesa and Rodriguez governments, Pedro Ticana is 
<br>unaffiliated with a particular political party and is an 
<br>effective political operator with a diverse political 
<br>background. A former adviser to Movement Towards Socialism 
<br>(MAS), Ticana is now closely aligned with Potosi Mayor 
<br>Joaquino and eastern Bolivia. Helping Joaquino organize a 
<br>new political party, Ticana could help establish a political 
<br>block comprising the country's southern and eastern 
<br>departments. Ticana's political experience with three 
<br>
<br>LA PAZ 00003400 002 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>different governments demonstrates his ability to work beyond 
<br>party lines to establish effective political connections and 
<br>build consensus. As a Quechua, Ticana has the ability to 
<br>take advantage of the political prominence indigenous groups 
<br>now enjoy. Political analysts, however, note Ticana prefers 
<br>to remain behind the scenes rather than seek a national 
<br>leadership position. At a November 2006 indigenous 
<br>roundtable with Ambassadors Goldberg and Shapiro, Ticana 
<br>presented himself as a moderate political thinker who seeks 
<br>to establish a political environment that values inclusion 
<br>and dialogue. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) MARIO COSSIO CEJAS: Touting a wide range of 
<br>experience in academia and politics, Tarija Prefect Mario 
<br>Cossio's potential as a rising opposition leader is aided by 
<br>his hydrocarbons-rich prefecture. Given Tarija's 
<br>hydrocarbons revenues, Cossio is well-equipped to advance the 
<br>agenda of the media luna (Pando, Beni, Tarija, and Santa Cruz 
<br>departments), especially on regional autonomy. A member of 
<br>Camino al Cambio, a civic political group, Cossio enjoys 
<br>broad public support and is viewed positively by the Bolivian 
<br>national media. His ability to rise as a national opposition 
<br>leader may also be aided by his discreet role in the highly 
<br>publicized divide between the media luna and the GOB, which 
<br>could help Cossio attract more wide-ranging political 
<br>support. Physically mestizo, Cossio can tap into the support 
<br>President Morales now enjoys by Bolivians who identify with 
<br>him and his background. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) RUBEN COSTAS: The public face of the media luna and a 
<br>member of Autonomia Por Bolivia, Ruben Costas' position as 
<br>prefect of the economic powerhouse Santa Cruz department 
<br>gives him a natural edge in establishing himself as a 
<br>regional opposition leader. Costas' willingness to work with 
<br>the United States would make him a solid democratic partner. 
<br>His politically savvy use of the media to advance the 
<br>interests of the media luna have helped establish Costas as 
<br>one of the primary political opposition leaders. His public 
<br>confrontations with the Morales administration, the latest 
<br>bringing a public retraction by Morales of his accusations 
<br>that Costas was involved in a plot against him, have helped 
<br>Costas score public victories against the GOB. Given his 
<br>close relationship with other prefects in eastern Bolivia and 
<br>his leadership on regional autonomy, Costas is well-known and 
<br>respected in the east. However, his close association with 
<br>eastern Bolivia may limit him to a regional leadership 
<br>position, as the Altiplano has historically opposed 
<br>candidates hailing from the east, especially the Santa Cruz 
<br>department. 
<br>
<br>------------- 
<br>THE DINOSAURS 
<br>------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) JOSE LUIS PAREDES MUNOZ: A member of PODEMOS who 
<br>values U.S. assistance in Bolivia, La Paz prefect Jose Luis 
<br>Paredes stands out as a potential national opposition leader. 
<br>In an October 11 meeting with ECOPOL, Paredes privately 
<br>expressed his interest in obtaining U.S. support to run for 
<br>the presidency (poloff explained that we do not intervene in 
<br>Bolivia's internal affairs). As the former mayor of El Alto, 
<br>Paredes has a strong base of support in the Altiplano, 
<br>despite the efforts of several MAS-controlled social sector 
<br>groups to drive him from office. With a history of 
<br>demonstrating an ability to govern, Paredes has responded 
<br>well to the enormous pressure he is under from his 
<br>constituency and from the central government. With an eye 
<br>towards his political future, Paredes is attempting to shore 
<br>up support through a public relations campaign highlighting 
<br>his accomplishments as prefect. However, Paredes remains 
<br>very vulnerable to allegations of corruption in regard to 
<br>charges filed against him on October 16 for actions allegedly 
<br>committed while he was mayor of El Alto. 
<br>
<br>LA PAZ 00003400 003 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) MANFRED REYES VILLA: A former presidential candidate, 
<br>Cochabamba Prefect and Agrupacion Unidad por Cochabamba (AUC) 
<br>leader Manfred Reyes Villa has a wealth of political 
<br>experience and broad name recognition although whispers of 
<br>corruption haunt him. Known for delivering on his promises, 
<br>Reyes is popular among his constituents, which is 
<br>particularly challenging given his position in an otherwise 
<br>MAS-dominated prefecture. Despite his political experience, 
<br>Reyes' political potential may have peaked during his 2002 
<br>presidential campaign, when he garnered approximately 22 
<br>percent of the national vote. Lacking a politically relevant 
<br>party, Reyes ties to Bolivia's old guard politicians will 
<br>likely keep him from regaining a national position. Although 
<br>Reyes may be unable to assume a national role, he will likely 
<br>remain an important player regionally. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) SAMUEL DORIA MEDINA: A wealthy prominent businessman 
<br>and national political figure (since his third place finish 
<br>in Bolivia's December 2005 national elections) Samuel Doria 
<br>Medina is the head of the National Unity (UN) party and a 
<br>delegate in the CA. An entrepreneur and former minister 
<br>under ex-President Jaime Paz Zamora, Medina's financial 
<br>resources and position within the CA enable him to coordinate 
<br>a national opposition movement. Known for having political 
<br>ambitions, Medina may try to thrust himself into the next 
<br>presidential race without regard for his realistic chances of 
<br>winning it. Medina's chances to run for the presidency, 
<br>however, have been reportedly neutralized by his willingness 
<br>to broker deals with the MAS in the CA and threats by the GOB 
<br>to nationalize his businesses. While the impact of these 
<br>reports are unknown, Medina would still have to find support 
<br>outside his party and overcome the leftist, indigenous trend 
<br>in Bolivian politics if he were to attempt a presidential 
<br>campaign. In the meantime, Medina will likely continue to 
<br>play a key role building consensus in the CA. 
<br>
<br>---------- 
<br>IRRELEVANT 
<br>---------- 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) JORGE "TUTO" QUIROGA RAMIREZ: The recognized leader 
<br>of PODEMOS, Jorge "Tuto" Quiroga is considered the glue that 
<br>binds his party in the CA and in Bolivia's congress. 
<br>Unfortunately, he seems tone-deaf to Bolivia's radically 
<br>changed political environment, and has been unable to strike 
<br>a chord with the population. As the leader of the largest 
<br>opposition group in the CA and a former president, Quiroga 
<br>remains Bolivia's primary opposition leader. Like Ortiz, 
<br>Quiroga's leadership of PODEMOS may undermine his ability to 
<br>win national office. Beginning late-November 2006, Quiroga 
<br>has started to take a more public stance on divisive issues 
<br>between his party and the GOB to build pressure and support 
<br>for a two-thirds vote in the CA. While effective as a party 
<br>leader, most political analysts concede Quiroga would not 
<br>fare well in a future presidential race. In a recent meeting 
<br>with the Ambassador, Quiroga appeared less interested in 
<br>Bolivian politics than discussing foreign policy -- that of 
<br>Bolivia as well as the U.S. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) OSCAR ORTIZ: An influential and well-known 
<br>opposition senator from Santa Cruz, Oscar Ortiz has made a 
<br>name for himself by using his political position to publicly 
<br>criticize the GOB. A member of PODEMOS, with a background in 
<br>business, Ortiz understands the intricacies of economics and 
<br>can use his experience to communicate policies that would 
<br>resonate with a Bolivian electorate that is increasingly 
<br>focused on employment. Like Costas, his ties to eastern 
<br>Bolivia and his pro-business outlook may diminish his ability 
<br>to rise through the political ranks, particularly in light of 
<br>GOB rhetoric against free market economics. Ortiz's 
<br>affiliation with the PODEMOS party may also prevent his 
<br>
<br>LA PAZ 00003400 004 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>emergence as an opposition leader that can gain broad 
<br>political appeal. 
<br>
<br>------------- 
<br>LEFT FIELDERS 
<br>------------- 
<br>
<br>¶12. (S/NF) SANTOS RAMIREZ: The president of Bolivia's senate, 
<br>Movement Towards Socialism (MAS) senator Santos Ramirez is 
<br>considered the political confidant of President Morales. A 
<br>lawyer by education and a teacher by training, Ramirez has an 
<br>extensive history in politics as a member of congress before 
<br>being elected to the senate in 2006. Born in the Potosi 
<br>department, Ramirez is well-known in Potosi and serves as the 
<br>head of the MAS party there. With a political career closely 
<br>aligned to President Morales' legislative agenda, Ramirez' 
<br>political future is considered heavily dependent on the 
<br>political successes of the GOB. Rumored to be a major player 
<br>in the MAS' political playbook, Ramirez is in a position to 
<br>assume a leadership position in the event President Morales 
<br>stumbles (reftel A). Ramirez' role in railroading 
<br>controversial legislative measures supported by President 
<br>Morales confirms the opinions of many political analysts who 
<br>consider him a radical. Emboldened by the newfound wave of 
<br>popularity President Morales is enjoying, Ramirez may shed 
<br>his politically adept style for a more radical approach. 
<br>With his strong alliances with the GOB, Ramirez may ride out 
<br>the wave of President Morales' strong popularity before 
<br>revealing his personal aspirations to emerge on Bolivia's 
<br>national stage. Sensitive reporting indicates that Ramirez 
<br>may be very vulnerable on corruption and human smuggling 
<br>charges. 
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) FERNANDO HUANACUNI: A relative unknown in Bolivia's 
<br>political sphere, professor, lawyer, and Aymara writer 
<br>Fernando Huanacuni has raised the eyebrows of political 
<br>analysts convinced President Morales' successor will hail 
<br>from the country's indigenous community. Relatively young in 
<br>political terms at thirty-nine years old, Huanacuni may 
<br>present a fresh perspective that would be welcomed by a 
<br>growing population of young Bolivians frustrated with a 
<br>government they view as unresponsive. A resident of El Alto 
<br>and born in the La Paz department, Huanacuni's ability to 
<br>galvanize support for a national run would directly challenge 
<br>President Morales' base of support. Despite his lack of name 
<br>recognition, Huanacuni's television show on social pressures 
<br>is helping him gain wider recognition if he uses it as a 
<br>method to raise his political profile. Similar to the 
<br>assessments made for other indigenous politicians, 
<br>Huanacuni's indigenous background could help him galvanize 
<br>greater support. 
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) JUAN DEL GRANADO: Known as the "the Gardener" for his 
<br>passionate support for environmentally-friendly public works, 
<br>La Paz Mayor Juan del Granado is popular among his 
<br>constituency for his efforts to reform La Paz and fight 
<br>corruption. He stands as a likely candidate to emerge 
<br>nationally from the MAS' rank-and-file if the opportunity 
<br>presented itself. A former member of the MIR and the 
<br>Movimiento Bolivia Libre (MBL), Granado is the founder and 
<br>current leader of the Movimiento Sin Miedo (MSM), a political 
<br>party he started when he ran for mayor that is now allied 
<br>with the MAS. In addition to the publicity Granado enjoys 
<br>from his position, his skillful use of radio and television 
<br>for constituent outreach help him raise his profile among the 
<br>electorate while highlighting his accomplishments in office. 
<br>Despite his alliances with MAS, however, Granado political 
<br>viability remains murky at best. Considered a member of the 
<br>middle class, Granado would likely have to counter negative 
<br>perceptions of the middle class among the indigenous 
<br>community and traditionally marginalized groups to court 
<br>their vote. A former minister in the Gonzalo Sanchez de 
<br>Lozada administration, Granado would be an easy target for 
<br>
<br>LA PAZ 00003400 005 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>this past association and this would present a high hurdle 
<br>for Granado to clear in a national run for office. 
<br>
<br>------- 
<br>COMMENT 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) The December 2005 and July 2006 national elections 
<br>exposed what turned out to be a hollow center of leadership 
<br>in Bolivia's political traditional political classes. It was 
<br>in this vacuum that Evo Morales took the presidency; 
<br>Bolivia's traditional leaders are still reacting to the 
<br>earthquake his victory represented. The rough-and-tumble 
<br>politics favored by Morales have further exposed the many 
<br>weaknesses of the traditional opposition. Most recently, the 
<br>emergence of divisive issues within the CA has spurred some 
<br>political leaders to action, and offered tentative clues to 
<br>possible alternative opposition leadership. While a 
<br>resurgence of the old opposition is possible, it is unlikely 
<br>that Bolivia's future leader will be one of the political 
<br>dinosaurs and irrelevant leaders of the past. Bolivia 
<br>remains an overwhelmingly poor country. Given the leftward 
<br>shift of rhetoric among many voters, a post-Morales 
<br>environment would likely offer serious electoral advantages 
<br>to a leader emerging from Evo's indigenous supporters. If 
<br>Morales were to exit unexpectedly, an indigenous or strong 
<br>regional leader would be the most likely candidate to fill 
<br>his position. This year, President Morales has had a lucky 
<br>run, with high hydrocarbons and other commodity revenues 
<br>leaving him abundant room to maneuver. That situation will 
<br>change dramatically, however, when his economic luck runs 
<br>out. End Comment.
