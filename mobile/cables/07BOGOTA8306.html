<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador William R. Brownfield
<br>Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)
<br>
<br>---------
<br>SUMMARY
<br>-------
<br>¶1. (C) GOC Peace Commissioner Luis Carlos Restrepo told the
<br>Ambassador that Venezuelan President Chavez' repeated
<br>violation of the rules set by President Uribe for Hugo
<br>Chavez' effort to promote a humanitarian accord with the
<br>Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) had forced
<br>Uribe to suspend Chavez' involvement. He conceded the GOC has
<br>paid a political cost for its decision, but said delay would
<br>have resulted in an even higher political price. Uribe has
<br>reached out to key Latin American presidents who have shown
<br>no desire to become involved in the issue. Restrepo said the
<br>GOC recognizes that France remains &obsessed8 with
<br>obtaining proof of life for Ingrid Betancourt and prefers to
<br>keep the French engaged with the GOC on ways to obtain the
<br>hostages' release. He spoke with French National Security
<br>Advisor Levitte on November 28, and the two agreed to work
<br>together to achieve the hostages' release. Restrepo noted
<br>that the GOC has already said it would welcome a unilateral
<br>FARC hostage release and would also provide legal benefits to
<br>any FARC member who freed some of the group's kidnap victims.
<br>END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) GOC Peace Commissioner Luis Carlos Restrepo told the
<br>Ambassador November 29 that the GOC did not seek the problems
<br>with Chavez over a humanitarian accord, but that Chavez had
<br>forced the GOC to act by repeatedly violating the rules set
<br>by President Uribe for Chavez, facilitation effort. Chavez
<br>had revealed confidential presidential conversations to the
<br>press, violated Colombia's "institutional hierarchy" by
<br>speaking directly to Colombian Army Commander Mario Montoya,
<br>and tried to marginalize the GOC by planning a meeting with a
<br>range of Colombian political figures, such as former
<br>President Ernesto Samper, in Caracas.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Restrepo said that the Caracas meeting formed part of
<br>a plan by Senator Piedad Cordoba and Chavez to create a type
<br>of "alternative" or transitional Colombian government. He
<br>acknowledged that the GOC has paid a political cost for
<br>suspending Chavez, facilitation role, but said such a
<br>development was inevitable. Restrepo compared Chavez to the
<br>FARC and other illegal armed group negotiators who constantly
<br>test the GOC limits. If the GOC had not pushed back, Chavez
<br>would have continued to assume a larger and large role. The
<br>GOC ended Chavez' role now to avoid paying a higher political
<br>cost later.
<br>
<br>-------------------------------------
<br>SHAPING DOMESTIC AND REGIONAL OPINION
<br>-------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Restrepo said that the GOC is trying to shape domestic
<br>and regional opinion to support its decision to suspend
<br>Chavez' facilitation effort. The GOC has explained that
<br>Chavez and Cordoba had made little concrete progress, noting
<br>that other countries had taken steps to advance the process
<br>but that the FARC had done nothing. Moreover, the breakdown
<br>of the process reflected the debate in Latin America over two
<br>different models of democracy. Chavez favors an
<br>authoritarian, statist model while Uribe advocates a
<br>representational democracy rooted in civil liberties, open
<br>markets, and independent institutions.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) He said Uribe had reached out to other Latin
<br>leaders*including Brazilian President Lula da Silva, Costa
<br>Rican President Oscar Arias, Peruvian President Alan Garcia,
<br>Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa, Uruguayan President
<br>Tabare Vazquez, and Argentine president-elect Cristina
<br>Kirchner*to explain his stance. At Correa's urging, he will
<br>attend the ceremony inaugurating Ecuador's constituent
<br>assembly. None of the leaders had voiced a desire to become
<br>involved in the issue.
<br>
<br>------------------------
<br>MANAGING FRENCH CONCERNS
<br>
<br>------------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Restrepo said the GOC recognizes that the French are
<br>"obsessed" with obtaining the FARC's release of
<br>French-Colombian dual national Ingrid Betancourt and that it
<br>needs to manage French concerns in a constructive fashion.
<br>French President Sarkozy had sent Uribe a letter on November
<br>22-the day after the suspension announcement--urging him to
<br>extend Chavez' role until December 31. Uribe had responded
<br>immediately on November 23, publicly stating that the GOC
<br>would welcome a unilateral FARC hand-over of proof of life or
<br>of Ingrid to Chavez. Restrepo said the GOC wants to keep the
<br>French engaged with the GOC on ways to obtain the hostages'
<br>release. Through the French, the GOC would also control the
<br>efforts of the Swiss and Spanish to achieve a humanitarian
<br>accord. Excluding the French would only encourage them to
<br>pursue unilateral options.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Restrepo said he spoke with French National Security
<br>Advisor Levitte, whom he considers to be a pragmatic,
<br>credible interlocutor, on November 28 to discuss a possible
<br>Uribe-Sarkozy phone call on November 29. Levitte said Uribe's
<br>decision to suspend Chavez' facilitation effort had surprised
<br>the French, creating a perception of failure. Sarkozy
<br>considered himself a friend of Uribe and Colombia, but faced
<br>substantial domestic pressure to produce results such as
<br>proof of life for Ingrid. The GOC and GOF need to work
<br>together to obtain the hostages' freedom.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Restrepo told Levitte the GOC remains committed to
<br>obtaining the hostages' release. The GOC has already stated
<br>that it would not stand in the way of unilateral FARC actions
<br>leading to the hostages' release and has also voiced its
<br>willingness to extend legal benefits, such as suspended
<br>sentences or reduced jail time under the Justice and Peace
<br>Law, to any FARC front commanders or other leaders who free
<br>some hostages. Such benefits would apply to the release of
<br>any of the 45 hostages being considered under the
<br>humanitarian accord, as well as the hundreds of "economic"
<br>victims held by the group. Restrepo added that the GOC
<br>remained interested in discussing a humanitarian accord with
<br>the FARC, but that any future effort should be discreet with
<br>limited international facilitation.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Levitte agreed to defer a Sarkozy-Uribe call until the
<br>week of December 3 to give the GOC time to develop possible
<br>mechanisms to obtain the hostages' release. Restrepo said he
<br>had also urged Levitte to serve as his contact on this issue,
<br>observing that it is important to reduce the role of the
<br>French Foreign Ministry. Restrepo said Inter-American
<br>Development Bank President and former Colombian Ambassador to
<br>Washington Luis Alberto Moreno is in Paris and would reach
<br>out to Levitte to brief him in greater detail on the reasons
<br>behind the GOC's decision to suspend Chavez' role.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Asked by the Ambassador if a joint French-USG
<br>demarche would be useful, Restrepo said such a message would
<br>be harmful at this time. It would generate false expectations
<br>and put additional pressure on the GOC. The GOC believes it
<br>currently works well with the French. Restrepo said that if
<br>he needs USG help in dealing with the French in the future,
<br>he will not hesitate to ask.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------------
<br>GOC WOULD EMBRACE FARC PROVISION OF PROOF OF LIFE TO CHAVEZ
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------------
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Restrepo reiterated that if the FARC provides proof
<br>of life to Chavez or Cordoba, the GOC will publicly embrace
<br>such a move. (Note: On November 29, Colombian security forces
<br>detained three FARC militia in Bogota who possessed five
<br>video tapes, as well as letters, providing proof of life for
<br>sixteen FARC hostages. These included Ingrid Betancourt and
<br>the three U.S. citizens.) The Ambassador noted that if the
<br>FARC gives Chavez proof of life, several U.S. Congressmen
<br>might travel to Caracas to meet with the Venezuelan
<br>President. Restrepo cautioned that this would not be useful
<br>since it would inflate Chavez' importance and encourage him
<br>to seek a renewed role in a humanitarian accord.
