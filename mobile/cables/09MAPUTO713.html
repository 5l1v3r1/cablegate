<br>REF: A. 08 MAPUTO 1228 
<br>¶B. 08 MAPUTO 1098 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Charge d'Affaires Todd C.Chapman, Reasons 1.4(b+d) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) Summary: Large-scale narcotics shipments pass 
<br>through Mozambique, taking advantage of a vast and lightly 
<br>guarded coastline. Money laundering may be increasing. 
<br>Narcotraffickers in the country have connections to South 
<br>Asia, and some appear to have links to the ruling Frelimo 
<br>party and the GRM. Using Department of State INL funds, the 
<br>Embassy has led a successful border security program with the 
<br>Portuguese Embassy that has resulted in the seizure of 
<br>narcotics. The mission has also provided support via DoD and 
<br>Treasury, and directed counternarcotic assessments by the 
<br>Africa Command, LegAtt, and DEA. While not a 
<br>thoroughly-corrupted narco-state, the trends in Mozambique 
<br>suggest cause for concern unless the GRM takes quick action 
<br>to address these growing problems. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>Large Scale Narcotics Shipments 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) In a series of investigative reports late last 
<br>year, Mozambique newsweekly Zambeze claimed Mozambique was 
<br>considered by some estimates to be the second largest drug 
<br>transit country in Africa after Guinea-Bissau. XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>Recent incidents suggest that larger amounts of 
<br>narcotics are indeed passing through the country, taking 
<br>advantage of a coastline twice the length of California's 
<br>with minimal control. Long-time commentator on Mozambique 
<br>Joseph Hanlon publicly declared in May that the value of 
<br>illicit drugs passing through the country probably surpasses 
<br>combined legal external trade. In mid-May, police seized $5 
<br>million in heroin at the Ressano Garcia-Lebombo border with 
<br>South Africa. In mid-June, police destroyed 7,000 liters of 
<br>precursor chemicals discovered at the port of Maputo from 
<br>China en route to South Africa; the United Nations Office of 
<br>Drug Control indicates that this port is heavily used to 
<br>import chemicals used for meth production. XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br> have described to P/E chief how 
<br>Pakistani-owned trucking companies based in Sofala province 
<br>over-declare imports at the Beira port as one way to hide the 
<br>quantities of drugs coming into the country. Early on June 
<br>20, police discovered about one ton of hashish at Chongouene 
<br>beach in Gaza province after receiving calls from local 
<br>fishermen about suspicious vehicle movements in the area. 
<br>
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br>Signs of Money Laundering Proliferate 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) A source inside the Frelimo party recently told 
<br>the Embassy that Mozambique, with ten banks and thirty 
<br>legally-registered exchange houses, has significantly more 
<br>financial institutions than the market in such an 
<br>impoverished country should be able to support with 
<br>legitimate business. He also observed that 1500 construction 
<br>projects are currently underway in Maputo--most financed with 
<br>cash and mostly in real estate, and noted that it was unusual 
<br>that housing prices in Maputo are increasing in spite of the 
<br>world financial crisis. Separately, Hanlon indicates that 
<br>the rapid growth in Mozambique's stock market is suspect, as 
<br>the value of stocks listed on the exchange is predicted to 
<br>reach $100 million within two years of opening. Finally, lax 
<br>regulation of casinos has raised concern by local radio and 
<br>TV commentators about that sector's role in money laundering. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>Criminal Ties to South Asia 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) A USAID report issued in 2006 notes that commerce 
<br>in Maputo depends on the financial acumen of a small number 
<br>of Muslims of South Asian-descent who contribute generously 
<br>to the FRELIMO party. A major contributor to former 
<br>President Chissano and President Guebuza from this community, 
<br>who resides less than a hundred meters from the Presidential 
<br>Compound, Mohamed Bashir Suleman (MBS), is the owner of the 
<br>
<br>MAPUTO 00000713 002 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>commercial MBS Group. Contacts at all levels have advised 
<br>Emboffs that MBS is a known large-scale narco-trafficker. 
<br>They indicate that MBS uses his FRELIMO party connections, as 
<br>well as his shopping mall, supermarkets, and hotels to import 
<br>narcotics and launder money without official scrutiny. Other 
<br>South Asian businessmen with ties to FRELIMO also operate a 
<br>vast network of loosely-regulated money changing houses, 
<br>which reportedly maintain financial ties with more radical 
<br>organizations in 
<br>Pakistan and elsewhere. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) A business contact recently shared with P/E chief 
<br>a copy of a letter from Mozambique's Chamber of Business 
<br>Associations (CTA) to the Prime Minister, expressing concern 
<br>about one company selling imported vegetable oils at prices 
<br>clearly below cost, noting that this type of price dumping 
<br>could result in the withdrawal from the market of other 
<br>companies and ultimately a monopoly to form. The contact 
<br>said that the letter was in response to efforts by the MBS 
<br>Group to consolidate control of this sector--but in reality 
<br>the message had nothing to do with vegetable oil--rather, it 
<br>was a veiled warning from the 
<br>business community to the government that MBS Group's use of 
<br>vegetable oil to cover the import of illicit drugs was so 
<br>brazen that it was no longer tolerable. 
<br>
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br>Narcotrafficking Connections in GRM? 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) The Frelimo source also told the Charge that MBS 
<br>Group regularly uses phantom imports to launder money, and 
<br>indicated that MBS and another immigrant, Ahmed Gassan (owner 
<br>of the Home Center Furniture store) collude with the GRM's 
<br>head of customs (who he called "the King of Corruption") 
<br>to reduce scrutiny on imports. The source also indicated 
<br>that Gassan's business interests are personally protected by 
<br>Minister of Planning and Development Aiuba Cuereneia. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
<br>USG Border Security, OTA, DoD Support, Other Assessments 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Using Department of State INL bureau funds, the 
<br>Embassy has a highly-successful joint project with the 
<br>Embassy of Portugal to provide training for GRM border 
<br>guards. With a very small investment of less than $200,000, 
<br>this program has led to the seizure of $2.5 million in cash 
<br>and the arrest of two Pakistani smugglers (ref B). While the 
<br>program was denied funding in FY09, it may receive support 
<br>again in FY10. Mozambique's Tax Authority (AT) has garnered 
<br>a reputation for honesty and transparency, and the AT's 
<br>director has publicly criticized the head of Customs about 
<br>smuggling concerns. Via the Department of Treasury's Office 
<br>of Technical Assistance, the USG is providing training and 
<br>capacity building to the AT, and is reviewing ways to 
<br>specifically support the AT's Financial Intelligence Unit. 
<br>DoD provided maritime training, small boats , and coastal 
<br>monitoring systems to the FADM and more of this type of 
<br>support is programmed for the future. Finally, at the 
<br>request of the Embassy, Africa Command, DEA, Treasury and 
<br>LegAtt representatives visited Maputo in early June to 
<br>conduct a joint assessment of the drug trafficking problem 
<br>and the GRM's capabilities. Initial findings validated the 
<br>pervasiveness of the problem and identified the institutional 
<br>weakness and level of corruption of Mozambican law 
<br>enforcement agencies as core problems inhibiting a coherent 
<br>government response. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU) At the most recent mini-Dublin meeting chaired in 
<br>late-May by the Portuguese Embassy, representatives from the 
<br>Dutch, British and German embassies specifically pointed out 
<br>weaknesses in the GRM's enforcement activities, highlighting 
<br>that concerns are widespread in the international community. 
<br>These concerns were quickly borne out, as in a presentation 
<br>at the meeting, a representative of the GRM's Inter-agency 
<br>Working Group on Narcotrafficking focused entirely on 
<br>domestic consumption and addressing the health needs of local 
<br>drug addicts. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
<br>Comment: Not Thoroughly-Corrupted, but Cause for Concern 
<br>
<br>MAPUTO 00000713 003 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
<br>
<br>¶9. (S/NF) Mozambique most certainly is not yet a 
<br>thoroughly-corrupted narco-state. However, it is becoming 
<br>increasingly clear that the magnitude of the drug shipments 
<br>passing through Mozambique may be on a much larger scale than 
<br>previously understood, taking advantage of the country's long 
<br>and unprotected coast and the facility with which port and 
<br>customs officials can be bribed. Money laundering, related 
<br>government corruption (possibly even official support), and 
<br>ties to South Asia mean that the problem has the potential to 
<br>get much worse. While the mission has made initial steps to 
<br>bring USG resources to bear, the road ahead will require a 
<br>comprehensive and coordinated effort by the international 
<br>community to staunch the flow of drugs, not to mention 
<br>strengthen the political will of the GRM to take concrete 
<br>action.
