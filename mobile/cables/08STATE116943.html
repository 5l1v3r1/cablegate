<br>¶7. (U) Significant Events
<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU) EUR - Ireland - Emergency Action Committee (EAC)
<br>Belfast met October 31 to discuss the armed forces homecoming
<br>parade scheduled for November 2 and the planned simultaneous
<br>counter-demonstrations by Sinn Fein and the dissident
<br>republican group Eirigi. Discussions centered on the parade
<br>route and the possibility of confrontations and violence in
<br>different areas, as well as the presence of AmCits along the
<br>parade and demonstration routes. The EAC decided the U.S.
<br>Consulate General should release a Warden Message to warn
<br>AmCits in Belfast. (Belfast 0137)
<br>
<br>¶9. (SBU) Sweden - Approximately 12 to 15 protesters, carrying
<br>banners and flags requesting fair treatment for the &Cuban
<br>Five8 in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, made an unscheduled
<br>appearance at U.S. Embassy Stockholm November 1. The group
<br>emerged from the nearby German Embassy and stopped briefly in
<br>front of Post. The RSO monitored the group; they did not
<br>attempt to contact Embassy officials, but appeared more
<br>interested in photographing the front of Post. The protesters
<br>departed within a few minutes before Embassy police could
<br>respond. No damages or injuries were reported. (RSO Stockholm
<br>Spot Report)
<br>
<br>¶10. (S//NF) NEA - Egypt - EAC Cairo convened October 20 to
<br>review recent threat reporting and access any threats
<br>specific to the planned visit by U.S. Secretary of State
<br>Condoleezza Rice on November 8 and 9. The EAC agreed there is
<br>no new, specific, and/or credible threat to U.S. interests in
<br>Egypt, but also assessed that Egypt remains a very tempting
<br>target for both indigenous and transnational terrorist
<br>elements. EAC members also agreed to enhance security
<br>measures at the American Presence Post in Alexandria. The EAC
<br>continues to assess the Government of Egypt,s (GoE)
<br>counterterrorism efforts as effective, and Post has a close
<br>relationship with the GoE on security matters. (Appendix 1)
<br>
<br>¶11. (S//NF) Kuwait - EAC Kuwait City convened November 2 to
<br>discuss the security impact of recent threat reporting,
<br>Embassy Kuwait election coverage, U.S. Marine Corps Birthday
<br>Ball, and the upcoming visit of the former U.S. President
<br>William J. Clinton. The EAC was briefed on the recent
<br>reporting of possible terrorist surveillance of housing areas
<br>within Kuwait City. Post is coordinating the release of this
<br>information to the Kuwait Security Service for further
<br>action. The RSO stated the Local Guard Force (LGF) Mobile
<br>Patrol unit will increase coverage in the housing occupied by
<br>Chief of Mission personnel within the named areas, defensive
<br>counterintelligence training with be given to locally
<br>employed staff, and a Security Notice reminding personnel to
<br>remain vigilant in their personal security procedures will be
<br>released. The EAC concluded that Post,s current security
<br>posture is appropriate for the planned events. (Appendix 2)
<br>
<br>¶12. (S//NF) EAP - Indonesia - EAC Jakarta convened October 30
<br>to discuss the security implications of the anticipated
<br>execution of the Bali bombers. The Government of Indonesia
<br>(GoI) recently announced they would be executed during the
<br>first week of November. Rumors are circulating around Jakarta
<br>that retaliatory attacks and demonstrations by those who
<br>support the bombers are possible. However, there is no
<br>specific or credible information regarding the planning of
<br>these types of attacks. One report mentioned possible suicide
<br>bomber attacks on shopping malls in Jakarta, specifically the
<br>Kelapa Gading mall in northern Jakarta, but without details.
<br>The U.S. Embassy assesses the likelihood of a terrorist
<br>attack conducted against U.S. or other Western interests in
<br>direct response to the executions is low. (Appendix source 3)
<br>
<br>¶13. (SBU) SCA - Pakistan - A motorcade carrying Pakistani
<br>Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Akhtar Ali Shah was
<br>targeted by a suicide vehicle-borne improvised explosive
<br>device (IED) attack in Marden Province on October 31 at
<br>around 2:30 p.m. Ali Shah and 20 others were wounded, and
<br>nine police officers were killed in the attack. On November
<br>1, at approximately 2:33 a.m., an explosion occurred at a
<br>police substation approximately 2,000 meters from the U.S.
<br>Consulate Peshawar residential area and official annexes. One
<br>police officer was killed and several other individuals were
<br>badly wounded. It is undetermined at this time whether the
<br>explosion was from a rocket or an explosion charge placed at
<br>the structure. The RSO will monitor these attacks. (RSO
<br>Peshawar Spot Report)
<br>
<br>¶14. (U) Key Concerns
<br>
<br>¶15. (S//FGI//NF) NEA - Lebanon - Al-Qa,ida affiliate to
<br>attack U.S. Embassy motorcade: According to a source of the
<br>Jordanian General Intelligence Directorate, as of
<br>mid-October, al-Qa,ida-affiliated elements in the Ayn
<br>al-Hilwah Palestinian refugee camp plan to attack a U.S.
<br>Embassy motorcade in Beirut. The men planning the operation
<br>had already collected an unspecified amount of explosives and
<br>a white 1983 Mercedes, which was currently inside the Shatila
<br>Palestinian refugee camp. The Mercedes was to be rigged with
<br>the explosives. (Appendix source 4)
<br>
<br>¶16. (S//FGI//NF) SCA - Maldives - Continued monitoring of
<br>al-Qa,ida associates: The Maldives Police Service continued
<br>to investigate and monitor the activities of Maldives-based
<br>al-Qa,ida associates Yoosuf Izadhy, Easa Ali, and Hasnain
<br>Abdullah Hameedh (a.k.a. Hameed). Izadhy was reportedly in
<br>contact with a militant group in Waziristan, which allegedly
<br>maintained unspecified links to al-Qa,ida. Izadhy was
<br>clandestinely working to recruit others into his
<br>organization, specifically seeking individuals who had
<br>undergone basic terrorism training in Pakistan. Izadhy
<br>planned to create a terrorist group in the Maldives with the
<br>assistance of the Waziristan-based group. Izadhy planned to
<br>send his members to Waziristan for training. Hameedh was in
<br>close contact with a number of individuals who had undergone
<br>training in Pakistan, including individuals who were members
<br>of Jamaat-ul Muslimeen and completed basic and advanced
<br>training by Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LT) in Pakistan. They followed
<br>the ideology of Abu Easa.
<br>
<br>¶17. (S//FGI//NF) DS/TIA/ITA notes, while the operational
<br>aspirations of Yoosuf Izadhy (Terrorist Identities Datamart
<br>Environment (TIDE) number 17312323), Easa Ali (TIDE number
<br>17312652), and Hasnain Abdullah Hameedh (TIDE number
<br>20686145) are unclear; past reporting suggests Maldivian
<br>extremists have demonstrated interest in actively
<br>participating in global jihadi activities by attempting to
<br>arrange travel and terrorist training in Pakistan. While many
<br>Maldivian participants of extremist online forums aimed to
<br>ultimately fight Coalition forces in Iraq and Afghanistan,
<br>mid-October 2007 debrief information following the September
<br>29 bombing in Male that targeted tourists indicates at least
<br>two of the operatives participated in the attack in exchange
<br>for travel from the islands after the operation and arranged
<br>study at a madrassa in Pakistan.
<br>
<br>¶18. (S//NF) Specific links to al-Qa,ida remain unclear;
<br>although, reporting from May detailed recruitment activity by
<br>Maldivian national Ahmed Zaki of Maldivians into the Kashmiri
<br>extremist group LT madrassas and training camps in Pakistan.
<br>A variety of reports from 2006 details linkages between
<br>Maldivians belonging to a group known as
<br>Jama-ah-tul-Muslimeen (JTM) and individuals participating in
<br>an anti-American Islamic extremist online forum called Tibyan
<br>Publications. JTM is an extremist group based in the UK that
<br>follows an extremist ideology known as Takfiir that actively
<br>encourages violent jihad and supports criminality against
<br>apostate states. (Appendix sources 5-18)
<br>
<br>¶19. (U) Threats & Analysis
<br>
<br>¶20. (S//NF) WHA - Mexico - Violence spikes again in Tijuana:
<br>According to a mid-level Baja California state police
<br>official, a turf war between the Arellano Felix Organization
<br>(AFO) and the Sinaloa Cartel has caused another increase in
<br>violence in Tijuana. The Mexican Government,s
<br>counternarcotics efforts -- in the form of 3,300 military and
<br>police assets patrolling the area under Operation Tijuana --
<br>have severely weakened the AFO,s operations. The Sinaloa
<br>Cartel, hoping to capitalize on the AFO,s weaknesses, is
<br>battling for control of Tijuana,s drug plaza. While the AFO
<br>assassins are skilled, Sinaloa Cartel hit men are poorly
<br>trained and have no aversion to public shootings; however, if
<br>the Sinaloa Cartel successfully ousts the AFO from Tijuana,
<br>DS/TIA/ITA notes the levels of violence should decrease.
<br>While residents and visitors are not being targeted, the
<br>likelihood of being in the wrong place at the wrong time is
<br>of increasing concern. Cartel targets are being killed during
<br>daytime hours in public areas of Tijuana, including
<br>restaurants, shopping centers, and near school buildings. The
<br>DoS, Travel Alert for Mexico was extended for six months on
<br>October 14 to reflect the current and widely reported crime
<br>and violence occurring throughout Mexico. (Open sources;
<br>Appendix sources 19-20)
<br>
<br>¶21. (U) AF - Cameroon - An examination of the background,
<br>goals, and tactics of the Niger Delta Defense and Security
<br>Council and the Bakassi Freedom Fighters: (S//NF) The October
<br>31 kidnapping of approximately 10 hostages off the shores of
<br>the Bakassi Peninsula has magnified the role of two groups --
<br>the Bakassi Freedom Fighters (BFF) and the Niger Delta
<br>Defense and Security Council (NDDSC) -- in the increasing
<br>insecurity in the Bakassi. The kidnappings, an overview of
<br>the NDDSC,s and BFF,s background, and an examination of
<br>their past operations, highlight the groups, possible intent
<br>to use novel, deadly, and unprecedented tactics to achieve
<br>their goals.
<br>
<br>¶22. (SBU) In the early morning of October 31, a group of
<br>armed men in three boats attacked a French Total vessel named
<br>Bourbon Sagita, which was located off the Cameroonian shore
<br>between Bakassi and Limbe. Although no Americans were
<br>directly impacted, at least seven French citizens, one
<br>Tunisian, one Senegalese, and several Cameroonian nationals
<br>were kidnapped; five remaining oil workers were left on the
<br>boat. Nobody was injured in the attack.
<br>
<br>¶23. (SBU) According to unconfirmed media reports, shortly
<br>after the raid, the BFF, part of a larger and shadowy
<br>alliance of the NDDSC, claimed responsibility for the attacks
<br>and threatened to kill the hostages, stating, &The 10 are in
<br>our hands. If you don,t tell the government of Cameroon to
<br>come here and discuss with us, we will kill them all in three
<br>days.8 On November 1, the NDDSC/BFF withdrew the threat, but
<br>stated it would hold the hostages until the government opened
<br>negotiations with them.
<br>
<br>¶24. (S//NF) The NDDSC/BFF is likely referring to discussions
<br>over the status of the Bakassi Peninsula in its statement.
<br>The region was transferred from Nigeria to Cameroon on August
<br>14, per an International Court of Justice ruling. According
<br>to e-mails it sent to media outlets, the NDDSC/BFF merged
<br>into an official alliance at the end of July in an attempt to
<br>forestall the hand over. Led by Commander Ebi Dari and
<br>General A.G. Dasuo, who claim they are fighting for
<br>&self-determination and freedom8 of the Bakassi Peninsula
<br>which contains a majority of Nigerian citizens. They are also
<br>demanding that two of their fighters captured in July be
<br>released and that Nigerians on the Bakassi Peninsula be
<br>compensated.
<br>
<br>¶25. (S//NF) An intelligence and open media search of the BFF
<br>provided negligible results. Meanwhile, although little
<br>background information is known about the NDDSC, it claims to
<br>have approximately 1,050 fighters. It has been in existence
<br>since at least 2002 and previously conducted low-level
<br>attacks against Cameroonian troops on the Bakassi. It can
<br>also be linked to three deadly operations prior to the hand
<br>over of the controversial region. In the most macabre raid,
<br>on June 9, the NDDSC allegedly killed and mutilated six
<br>members of a Cameroonian delegation visiting the Peninsula,
<br>including the deputy subregional commander. It also claimed
<br>responsibility for a November 2007 raid on a Cameroonian
<br>military outpost which killed 21 soldiers; this claim remains
<br>unconfirmed. (Please see the July 26 DS Daily for further
<br>information on the pre-hand over security incidents in the
<br>Bakassi.)
<br>
<br>¶26. (S//NF) Although the post-hand over period has been
<br>defined by a series of attacks, the NDDSC/BFF has released
<br>statements denying culpability in some of those operations.
<br>These include a September 28 bank robbery in Limbe and a
<br>September 13 attack against a trawler off the Bakassi
<br>Peninsula. The NDDSC/BFF may be responsible for some
<br>post-hand over operations, while others may have been
<br>conducted by different militants in the region, including in
<br>the Niger Delta. Despite similar tactics in all these
<br>operations, including the use of speedboats carrying heavily
<br>armed masked men, at this time, there are no clear
<br>indications the NDDSC/BFF has a defined relationship with the
<br>Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) or
<br>any other prominent Niger Delta group.
<br>
<br>¶27. (S//NF) Instead, the series of raids by the NDDSC/BFF may
<br>possibly signify new tactics being pursued in the Bakassi
<br>region. In its early raids, the NDDSC/BFF primarily used
<br>deadly and brutal force against the Cameroonian military, but
<br>often spared expatriates and civilians. Two recent attacks,
<br>however -- the June 9 attack and the October 31
<br>hostage-taking operation -- have demonstrated its desire to
<br>expand its targets. In the June 6 raid, the NDDSC targeted a
<br>political delegation and mutilated a deputy subregional
<br>commander, the equivalent of a governor. It is unclear if the
<br>NDDSC was directly targeting the governor; but, nevertheless,
<br>the group demonstrated its desire to also kill politicians.
<br>For its part, the October 31 attacks was the first kidnapping
<br>of expatriates off the coast of Cameroon.
<br>
<br>¶28. (S//NF) Also of concern is the NDDSC/BFF,s intent to
<br>hold hostages indefinitely after initially threatening to
<br>kill them. Whereas MEND and other Delta groups kidnapped
<br>hostages primarily to garner ransom money or to force oil
<br>companies to scale back operations, they had seldom directly
<br>harmed or threatened to kill hostages. They also often
<br>released hostages shortly after their capture. Moreover,
<br>given its intent to hold the hostages for a political
<br>objective, the NDDSC/BFF may find it convenient to continue
<br>operations against expatriates in the region to pressure the
<br>Cameroonian Government and to ensure that its political
<br>demands are met. (Open sources; Yaound 1071; 0754; 0706;
<br>Appendix sources 21-28)
<br>
<br>¶29. (S//FGI//NF) SCA - Bangladesh - Rejection of IDP to
<br>register for December elections: As of late October, the
<br>Bangladeshi Election Commission was set to reject the Islamic
<br>Democratic Party,s (IDP,s) attempt to register for the
<br>December parliamentary elections. The IDP is a nascent
<br>political party formed by senior members of the Islamic
<br>terrorist group Harakat-ul-Jihad-i-Islami Bangladesh
<br>(HUJI-B). Bangladesh,s Directorate General of Forces
<br>Intelligence (DGFI) supported the formation of the IDP as a
<br>way to bring HUJI-B into the mainstream and reported it
<br>tightly monitored the group,s activities; although, HUJI-B
<br>has never renounced the use of violence to implement its
<br>vision of transforming Bangladesh into a Muslim theocracy.
<br>According to U.S. Embassy Dhaka, which strongly opposed the
<br>creation of the IDP, the party and its leadership will likely
<br>be angered by the decision and may respond with violence
<br>possibly against the commission or the U.S. Mission or
<br>interests.
<br>
<br>¶30. (S//NF) Arrests and monitoring have undoubtedly hindered
<br>HUJI-B,s capabilities in recent years, and it is entirely
<br>plausible the group is pursuing the creation of a political
<br>wing to improve its ability to support and carry out
<br>terrorist activity. A late-September assessment from
<br>Bangladesh,s National Security Intelligence Organization
<br>(NSI) voiced concern that the party,s creation would free
<br>extremists to pursue extremist activity under the cover of a
<br>moderate front organization. Indeed, there are no indications
<br>IDP would garner a significant number of votes. Analysis from
<br>the DoS, Office of Research noted the majority of
<br>Bangladeshis want Awami League and Bangladesh National Party
<br>leaders Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia to participate in the
<br>December elections. Interestingly, 80 percent stated they
<br>would ignore a call by either party to boycott the vote.
<br>One-third further stated they would join street protests in
<br>the face of a cancellation of elections.
<br>
<br>¶31. (S//FGI//NF) Although there is little information
<br>available regarding HUJI-B,s current capabilities, its
<br>membership likely does retain the ability to manufacture and
<br>use explosives and has previously favored targeting
<br>high-profile individuals for attack. While there is no
<br>specific reporting at the present time detailing plots
<br>against U.S. interests in Bangladesh, the group has publicly
<br>articulated its anti-Western and -Indian stance, including
<br>signing Usama Bin Ladin,s 1998 fatwa against the West. In
<br>regards to HUJI-B,s capabilities, DGFI,s, Rapid Action
<br>Battalion,s (RAB,s), and NSI,s assessments vary
<br>significantly. Following the early-March U.S. designation of
<br>HUJI-B as a foreign terrorist organization, RAB assessed
<br>HUJI-B would not respond with violence due to the severe
<br>degradation of the group,s capability and leadership
<br>structure from arrests and active surveillance. Some member
<br>who wanted to independently attack Western interests,
<br>however, remained technically capable of carrying out
<br>low-level attacks using small arms, grenades, and IEDs. DGFI
<br>likewise reported HUJI-B was &an organization on the run8
<br>and that it did not pose a threat to U.S. interests in
<br>Bangladesh. NSI conversely assessed HUJI-B would react
<br>violently to the designation and would attempt to conduct an
<br>attack against the U.S. official presence in Dhaka; although,
<br>there was no information available detailing such an
<br>operation. Thus far, HUJI-B has not carried out an attack
<br>against American interests in Bangladesh, but the group has
<br>been linked to assassination attempts on intellectuals,
<br>journalists, and politicians, including two thwarted attempts
<br>on the life of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina during public
<br>addresses and a grenade attack that injured the British high
<br>commissioner in May 2004. (&Bangladeshis have high hopes for
<br>national elections,8 DoS Office of Research; Appendix
<br>sources 29-40)
<br>
<br>¶32. (U) Cyber Threats
<br>
<br>¶33. (S//REL TO USA, FVEY) WHA - CTAD comment: On October 16,
<br>at least one e-mail account within the Government of Canada
<br>received a Trojanized message from a Yahoo account claiming
<br>to represent a U.S. embassy. The bogus subject line was an
<br>invitation for a private meeting with a named DoS employee.
<br>The attached Microsoft Word document was a malicious
<br>&invitation8 file that, when opened, attempts to beacon and
<br>create a connection to &jingl.cable.nu8 via port 8080. The
<br>&cable.nu8 domain remains one of concern, as it has
<br>historically been associated with activity from Chinese
<br>hacker organizations.
<br>
<br>¶34. (U) EUR - CTAD comment: The European Commission (EC) this
<br>week proposed legislation to establish a Critical
<br>Infrastructure Warning Information Network (CIWIN) to improve
<br>information sharing among European Union (EU) member nations.
<br>The proposed legislation would enable the EC to launch and
<br>manage the CIWIN, a secure information technology (IT) system
<br>aimed at sharing knowledge on threats, vulnerabilities, and
<br>protection of critical infrastructures. The CIWIN would be a
<br>voluntary tool for transmitting sensitive information and
<br>would also include a rapid alert system for critical
<br>infrastructure, allowing EU nations to post alerts on
<br>immediate threats.
<br>
<br>¶35. (U) AF - CTAD comment: Sudanese law enforcement recently
<br>reported the arrest of three hackers who have allegedly
<br>attacked more than 300 government and public websites during
<br>the last few months. Among the hacked sites was that of the
<br>National Telecommunication Corporation, which is responsible
<br>for oversight of telecommunication service providers as well
<br>as many other aspects of Sudanese IT and network stability.
<br>The three highly skilled hackers, all of whom are Sudanese,
<br>reportedly caused significant damage to their targets, but
<br>their motivation for the attacks and any potential group
<br>affiliations are yet undetermined.
<br>
<br>¶36. (C) NEA - CTAD comment: On October 21, officials from the
<br>Kuwaiti Central Agency for Information (CAIT) and the
<br>National Security Bureau (NSB) expressed concerns for foreign
<br>and domestic threats to Kuwaiti information systems.
<br>According to these organizations, some of the issues plaguing
<br>Government of Kuwait (GoK) networks are suspected attacks
<br>from Iranian hackers, insider corruption and misuse of
<br>resources, and a lack of sufficient interagency coordination
<br>and guidance for monitoring users, activities and
<br>investigating incidents. For example, the groups, inability
<br>to adequately examine malicious software (malware) injections
<br>or internal abuse of system access continues to hinder the
<br>GoK,s capacity to ensure the protection of sensitive
<br>information. Therefore, the CAIT and NSB are interested in
<br>learning more about U.S. cyber security programs as well as
<br>receiving additional training and support.
<br>
<br>¶37. (S//NF) EAP - CTAD comment: Between September 29 and
<br>October 2, a conference was held by the German Federal Office
<br>for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV). During this
<br>conference, the BfV delivered a briefing on its analysis of
<br>the cyber threat posed by the People,s Republic of China
<br>(PRC), which appears to mirror conclusions drawn by the U.S.
<br>Intelligence Community. The BfV surmises the intention of PRC
<br>actors is espionage, and the primary attack vector used in
<br>their malicious activity is socially engineered e-mail
<br>messages containing malware attachments and/or embedded links
<br>to hostile websites. According to reporting, &from October
<br>2006 to October 2007, 500 such e-mail operations were
<br>conducted against a wide range of German organizations,8 and
<br>the attacks appear to be increasing in scope and
<br>sophistication. The socially engineered e-mail messages
<br>delivered to German computer systems were spoofed to appear
<br>to come from trusted sources and contain information
<br>&targeted specifically to the recipient,s interests,
<br>duties, or current events.8 This malicious activity has
<br>targeted a wide variety of German organizational levels to
<br>include &German military, economic, science and technology,
<br>commercial, diplomatic, research and development, as well as
<br>high-level government (ministry and chancellery) systems.8
<br>In addition, German intelligence reporting indicates an
<br>increase in activity was detected immediately preceding
<br>events such as German Government, or commercial, negotiations
<br>involving Chinese interests.

<br>¶38. (U) SCA - CTAD comment: The National Science Foundation
<br>and the Pakistan Higher Education Commission recently
<br>announced the establishment of a Pakistan extension to an
<br>international high-speed network already connecting U.S. and
<br>EC systems. The new portion of the network links Pakistani
<br>scientists and students to facilities in the U.S. through
<br>additional connections to Singapore and Japan. This project
<br>emerged from February 2007 discussions of the U.S.-Pakistan
<br>Joint Committee on Science and Technology that sought to
<br>promote cooperation and innovation among education and
<br>business sectors. (Open sources; Appendix sources 41-43)

<br>¶39. (S//NF) Worldwide - BC conducting CNE on USG systems:
<br>
<br>¶40. (S//NF) Key highlights:
<br>BC actively targets USG and other organizations via
<br>socially engineered e-mail messages.
<br>BC actors recently compromised the systems of a U.S. ISP
<br>to carry out CNE on a USG network.
<br>Additional IP addresses were identified this month as
<br>compromised and used for BC activity.
<br>BC has targeted DoS networks in the past and may again in
<br>the future via spoofed e-mail.
<br>
<br>¶41. (S//REL TO USA, FVEY) Source paragraph: &Byzantine
<br>Candor (BC) actors have compromised multiple systems located
<br>at a U.S. Internet service provider (ISP) and have used the
<br>systems as part of BC,s U.S.-based attack infrastructure
<br>since at least March, targeting multiple victims including at
<br>least one USG agency.8
<br>
<br>¶42. (S//NF) CTAD comment: Since late 2002, USG organizations
<br>have been targeted with social-engineering online attacks by
<br>BC actors. BC, an intrusion subset of Byzantine Hades
<br>activity, is a series of related computer network intrusions
<br>affecting U.S. and foreign systems and is believed to
<br>originate from the PRC. BC intruders have relied on
<br>techniques including exploiting Windows system
<br>vulnerabilities and stealing login credentials to gain access
<br>to hundreds of USG and cleared defense contractor systems
<br>over the years. In the U.S., the majority of the systems BC
<br>actors have targeted belong to the U.S. Army, but targets
<br>also include other DoD services as well as DoS, Department of
<br>Energy, additional USG entities, and commercial systems and
<br>networks. BC actors typically gain initial access with the
<br>use of highly targeted socially engineered e-mail messages,
<br>which fool recipients into inadvertently compromising their
<br>systems. The intruders then install malware such as
<br>customized keystroke-logging software and command-and-control
<br>(C&C) utilities onto the compromised systems and exfiltrate
<br>massive amounts of sensitive data from the networks. This
<br>month, BC actors attempted to compromise the network of a
<br>U.S. political organization via socially engineered e-mail
<br>messages (see CTAD Daily Read File dated October 16).
<br>
<br>¶43. (S//REL TO USA, ACGU) CTAD comment: Also discovered this
<br>month by USG analysts was the compromise of several computer
<br>systems located at a commercial ISP within the United States.
<br>According to Air Force Office of Special Investigations
<br>(AFOSI) reporting, hackers based in Shanghai and linked to
<br>the PRC,s People,s Liberation Army (PLA) Third Department
<br>have been using these compromised systems as part of the
<br>larger BC attack infrastructure to facilitate computer
<br>network exploitation (CNE) of U.S. and foreign information
<br>systems. Since March, the responsible actors have used at
<br>least three separate systems at the unnamed ISP in multiple
<br>network intrusions and have exfiltrated data via these
<br>systems, including data from at least one USG agency. AFOSI
<br>reporting indicates, on March 11, BC actors gained access to
<br>one system at the ISP, onto which the actors transferred
<br>multiple files, including several C&C tools. From here, the
<br>intruders used the tools to obtain a list of usernames and
<br>password hashes for the system. Next, on April 22, BC actors
<br>accessed a second system at the ISP, where they transferred
<br>additional software tools. From April through October 13, the
<br>BC actors used this computer system to conduct CNE on
<br>multiple victims. During this time period, the actors
<br>exfiltrated at least 50 megabytes of e-mail messages and
<br>attached documents, as well as a complete list of usernames
<br>and passwords from an unspecified USG agency. Additionally,
<br>multiple files were transferred to the compromised ISP system
<br>from other BC-associated systems that have been previously
<br>identified collecting e-mail messages from additional
<br>victims. The third system at the U.S. ISP was identified as
<br>compromised on August 14, when BC actors transferred a
<br>malicious file onto it named
<br>&salaryincrease-surveyandforecast.zip.8 According to AFOSI
<br>analysis, BC actors use this system to host multiple webpages
<br>that allow other BC-compromised systems to download malicious
<br>files or be redirected to BC C&C servers.
<br>
<br>¶44. (S//REL TO USA, FVEY) CTAD comment: Additional DoD
<br>reporting this month indicates BC actors have used multiple
<br>other systems to conduct CNE against U.S. and foreign systems
<br>from February through September. A October 23 DoD cable
<br>states Shanghai-based hackers associated with BC activity and
<br>linked to the PLA have successfully targeted multiple U.S.
<br>entities during this time period. The cable details dozens of
<br>identified Internet Protocol (IP) addresses associated with
<br>BC activity as well as the dates of their activity. All of
<br>the IP addresses listed resolve to the CNC Group Shanghai
<br>Province Network in Shanghai, and all the host names of the
<br>addresses contained Asian keyboard settings as well as China
<br>time zone settings. Most of these IP addresses were
<br>identified as responsible for direct CNE of U.S. entities,
<br>including unspecified USG organizations, systems and
<br>networks. Interestingly, although the actors using each IP
<br>address practiced some degree of operational security to
<br>obfuscate their identities, one particular actor was
<br>identified as lacking in these security measures. On June 7,
<br>the BC actor, using an identified IP address, was observed
<br>using a Taiwan-based online bulletin board service for
<br>personal use.
<br>
<br>¶45. (S//NF) CTAD comment: BC actors have targeted the DoS in
<br>the past on multiple occasions with socially engineered
<br>e-mail messages containing malicious attached files and have
<br>successfully exfiltrated sensitive information from DoS
<br>unclassified networks. As such, it is possible these actors
<br>will attempt to compromise DoS networks in the future. As BC
<br>activity continues across the DoD and U.S., DoS personnel
<br>should practice conscientious Internet and e-mail use and
<br>should remain informed on BH activity. (Appendix sources
