<br>SUBJECT: QUESTIONING PUTIN'S WORK ETHIC
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador John Beyrle.  Reason:  1.4 (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary. Rumors about Prime Minister Putin's
<br>disengagement from his duties have proliferated in Moscow,
<br>suggesting that he has lost his "edge" in making critical
<br>decisions on measures linked to the economic crisis. Putin
<br>has reportedly been "working from home" on many issues,
<br>leaving much of the running of the government to his
<br>deputies, particularly First Deputy Prime Minister Igor
<br>Shuvalov. While some here see Putin's withdrawal as
<br>increasing the odds that he might step down from office, most
<br>continue to emphasize his centrality in the political
<br>constellation, with his hands-off behavior reflecting the
<br>lack of an acceptable compromise amongst the Kremlin elite on
<br>difficult economic issues. End Summary.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) There are consistent reports that Putin resents or
<br>resists the workload he carries as Prime Minister to
<br>galvanize the Russian bureaucracy. Well-connected XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX told us that Putin is
<br>said to be "distracted" and "disinterested," leaving
<br>day-to-day management of the GOR to Shuvalov.  XXXXXXXXXXXX, who
<br>was a member of XXXXXXXXXXXX,
<br>said that only Putin has the authority to lead the GOR and,
<br>in his absence, economic policy responses to the crisis have
<br>been entirely ad hoc. XXXXXXXXXXXX saw the ongoing budget revision
<br>process as further evidence of Putin's fatigue; in more
<br>resolute times, Putin would have ended the fiscal haggling
<br>quickly. Instead, it has dragged on for two months during the
<br>worst financial crisis in a decade. Prominent XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX agreed about Putin's isolation, saying
<br>that the PM is increasingly isolated and has regular contact
<br>only with Shuvalov and Kudrin.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Similarly, XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX told us that Putin has
<br>not been on a regular schedule at the Russian White House,
<br>preferring to leave the day-to-day operations of government
<br>in the hands of the "actual Prime Minister" Shuvalov, an
<br>assessment shared by XXXXXXXXXXXX.
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX alleged that there are a number of documents waiting
<br>for Putin's signature, several of which are linked to the
<br>government's anti-crisis package, that are creating backups
<br>in the implementation of important projects. XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX told us it is well known
<br>that Putin did not like coming to the Russian White House,
<br>where he was confronted with stacks of papers on issues of
<br>minuscule importance, on which he did not want to expend his
<br>energy. The problem, XXXXXXXXXXXX noted, was that the Russian
<br>system was geared to top-down decisions and paralysis was
<br>often the result of Putin's inaction.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) The rise of rumors such as these suggest that Putin
<br>may be losing some of his Teflon persona under the pressures
<br>of Russia's economic woes, at least among the elite. However,
<br>recent Levada surveys reinforce that most Russians continue
<br>to see Putin as "running" the country (87 percent of
<br>respondents saw him holding his power, up from 74 percent a
<br>year ago). While some speculate that Putin's disengagement
<br>may presage a readiness to step down from office, most
<br>continue to stress his centrality in the ruling structure and
<br>his personal sense as the "savior" of Russia. Indeed, his
<br>disengagement reflects his long-standing predilection to
<br>prevaricate on difficult issues and his recognition that a
<br>sharp reduction in resources limits his ability to find
<br>workable compromises among the Kremlin elite.
