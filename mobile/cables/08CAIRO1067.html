<br>OF WEF 
<br> 
<br>Classified by DCM Stuart Jones for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Codel Baird discussed Egyptian and regional 
<br>issues with Egypt's political and business leaders on the 
<br>margins of the May 18 - 20 World Economic Forum (WEF) in 
<br>Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt.  President Mubarak, Intelligence 
<br>Chief Omar Soliman, and presidential son Gamal Mubarak 
<br>focused on the need for deep engagement to resolve the 
<br>Israeli/Palestinian crisis and to hinder Iran's growing 
<br>influence in the region.  On Iraq, Mubarak said "you cannot 
<br>leave" but advised strengthening the military and allowing a 
<br>"fair" dictator to come to power via a coup.  "Forget 
<br>democracy," he opined, "the Iraqis are too tough by nature." 
<br> On the economic side, Egypt's business leaders regretted the 
<br>lack of a U.S.-Egypt free trade agreement and asked the U.S. 
<br>to push Egypt harder on good governance and democratic 
<br>reform.  Codel Baird consisted of Representatives Brian Baird 
<br>(D-WA), Christopher Shays (R-CT), Peter DeFazio (D-OR), Jeff 
<br>Fortenberry (R-NE), and Jim Cooper (D-TN); Representative 
<br>Jane Harman (D-CA) joined the codel briefly on May 18.  End 
<br>summary. 
<br> 
<br>President Mubarak 
<br>----------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) The codel began by thanking Mubarak for his positive 
<br>leadership on regional issues.  Mubarak said that he had 
<br>advised Vice President Cheney and other U.S. officials not to 
<br>invade Iraq and that "no one listened," but that now "it 
<br>would be a mistake" to withdraw forces immediately because it 
<br>would further open the door for Iran.  Asked about U.S.-Egypt 
<br>relations, Mubarak confirmed that "we have very good 
<br>relations with the U.S.," but "your administration is not 
<br>well-informed."  However, "I am patient by nature," he said, 
<br>in apparent reference to U.S. criticisms over human rights 
<br>and democratization.   Congressman Shays encouraged Mubarak 
<br>to engage with Iraq as much as possible and asked if Egypt 
<br>would send an ambassador, to which Mubarak replied "no, I 
<br>cannot do it.  When there is stability I am willing, but I 
<br>cannot force civilians to go." 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) Asked about Egypt's reaction if Iran developed nuclear 
<br>weapons capability, Mubarak said that none will accept a 
<br>nuclear Iran, "we are all terrified."  Mubarak said that when 
<br>he spoke with former Iranian President Khatami he told him to 
<br>tell current President Ahmedinejad "not to provoke the 
<br>Americans" on the nuclear issue so that the U.S. is not 
<br>forced to strike.  Mubarak said that Egypt might be forced to 
<br>begin its own nuclear weapons program if Iran succeeds in 
<br>those efforts. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) Asked about whether the U.S. should set a timeline for 
<br>withdrawal from Iraq, Mubarak said "you cannot leave" because 
<br>"you would leave Iran in control."  Mubarak explained his 
<br>recipe for a way forward: "strengthen the armed forces, relax 
<br>your hold, and then you will have a coup.  Then we will have 
<br>a dictator, but a fair one.  Forget democracy, the Iraqis are 
<br>by their nature too tough." 
<br> 
<br>Omar Soliman 
<br>------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) Egyptian General Intelligence Service (EGIS) chief 
<br>Omar Soliman gave the codel an expansive evaluation of the 
<br>key issues in the region.  He focused on Iran's growing 
<br>influence in Iraq, with Hamas, with Hizballah in Lebanon, and 
<br>with Shia communities in the Gulf.  To solve regional 
<br>problems Egypt is working on three tracks - Palestine, 
<br>Lebanon, and Iraq. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) Egypt hopes to achieve something soon on the 
<br>Palestinian track, he said, but neither side is ready to stop 
<br>the vicious circle of violence, although most on both sides 
<br>want "quiet."  Soliman's job now, he said, is to bridge the 
<br>gaps on specific issues like border crossings, prisoner 
<br>exchange, and bringing Hamas and the PA back together.  He 
<br>hoped to see an agreement on borders for a Palestinian state 
<br>by the end of 2008, and noted that as a practical matter very 
<br>few Palestinian refugees would seek right of return. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) On Lebanon, speaking a week before the Doha agreement 
<br>was penned, Soliman said the three problems are Syria's large 
<br>influence, lack of power of the majority over militia forces, 
<br>and weak Arab support for the government.  Syria is seeking a 
<br>deal with Israel and the U.S. over returning the Golan and 
<br>canceling the Hariri tribunal to lessen its meddling and 
<br>Lebanon needs a strong, nationalist army.  Soliman bemoaned 
<br>that the Arab states have too poor relations with Syria to 
<br> 
<br>CAIRO 00001067  002 OF 002 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>push them effectively. 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (C) On Iraq, Egypt meets regularly with Jordan, Saudi 
<br>Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, and Turkey to discuss reducing Iranian 
<br>influence.  The GOI must understand it has support from the 
<br>Arabs and the U.S., not just Iran, he said.  Soliman 
<br>advocated making Iran suffer economically to be "too busy 
<br>with its people" to make problems in Iraq.  Reducing Iranian 
<br>influence will help the Iraqi government become one, and not 
<br>a competition between Sunni and Shi'a. he said. 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C) Asked about the consequences of any U.S. strike on 
<br>Iranian nuclear capabilities, Soliman said such an attack 
<br>would not destroy Iran's nuclear capabilities and would only 
<br>unite Iranians with their leadership and against the U.S.  He 
<br>repeated the need to make Iran "busy with its people" by 
<br>effective sanctions, citing the successful example of Libya. 
<br>Asked about Sudan, he said that Egypt is still working to 
<br>make north-south unity attractive, and to encourage talks 
<br>between the GOS and rebels and between Bashir and Deby. 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (C) Asked what it means when Arabs say that the U.S. 
<br>"should listen to us," Soliman gave the example that 
<br>President Mubarak warned Vice President Cheney about the 
<br>consequences of the U.S. invading Iraq.  Additionally, "your 
<br>unilateral positions on economic aid are difficult." 
<br>However, Soliman emphasized that Egypt is keen to continue to 
<br>have a "very close" relationship with the U.S. 
<br> 
<br>Gamal Mubarak 
<br>------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (C) Gamal opined that the "battle lines are clearer for 
<br>Egypt than ever before" on regional issues.  The region "will 
<br>not realize its full potential as long as geopolitical 
<br>problems continue," he said.  With the Israeli/Palestinian 
<br>problem in particular, "we are racing against time."  Gamal 
<br>advocated close engagement by the U.S., Egypt, and other 
<br>countries (NFI) in order to make practical improvements in 
<br>the every day lives of Palestinians and develop a framework 
<br>for a final deal, with borders as the key issue.  Other 
<br>regional issues such as Iran and Lebanon are "much more 
<br>complicated," he said; "the picture is not that rosy." 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (C) Representative Baird raised the issue of USAID 
<br>efforts to assist conservation of Red Sea reefs, which Gamal 
<br>agreed was an important issue.  Representative Shays asked 
<br>Gamal's opinion of Syria President Bashar Al Assad, to which 
<br>Gamal replied that "he understands the world better than his 
<br>father," but that he is worried that opening up politically 
<br>or economically could result in a loss of control. 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (C) Representative Harman asked for Egypt to do more to 
<br>fight smuggling to Gaza through tunnels, perhaps by setting 
<br>up roadblocks a few miles before the border to intercept 
<br>contraband.  Gamal said that the border is a "shared concern" 
<br>and Egypt is doing what it can to address smuggling. 
<br> 
<br>¶14. (C) Representative Fortenberry asked about how to counter 
<br>a developing Iranian nuclear program.  Egypt and Saudi 
<br>Arabia, as well as Jordan, are the "heavyweights" that can 
<br>counter Iran, Gamal said, but he advocated movement on the 
<br>Israeli/Palestinian track to remove a prime issue that Iran 
<br>can use as a pretext. 
<br> 
<br>American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶15. (SBU) The AmCham group led by President Omar Mohanna 
<br>(Suez Cement) lamented that the lack of a U.S.-Egypt FTA 
<br>continues to push Egypt's trade towards Europe and away from 
<br>the U.S.  They praised the Qualified Industrial Zones (QIZ) 
<br>program and advocated expanding it to upper Egypt, though 
<br>they acknowledged that increasing Egyptian textile exports to 
<br>the U.S. would be a sensitive issue in the U.S. textile 
<br>lobby.  Karim Ramadan (Microsoft) praised the historic role 
<br>of USAID in Egypt and asked that it continue with a focus on 
<br>education and health, areas in particular need of development 
<br>in Egypt.
