<br>Classified By: CDA Angie Bryan for reasons 1.4(b) and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: President Saleh believes the Saudi
<br>Government's military actions in Sa'ada will alleviate
<br>mounting domestic political pressure on him to demonstrate
<br>progress against the Houthi rebels, according toxxxxx 
<br>with close personal ties to
<br>Saleh and his inner circle. xxxxx told EconOff that Saleh
<br>views Saudi involvement in the war, and the concomitant
<br>increase in direct Saudi budget support to the ROYG, as an
<br>incentive to prolong the ROYG's campaign in Sa'ada. xxxxx
<br>also claimed that members of the Saudi Special Office for
<br>Yemen Affairs, in contrast to the Saudi Government's official
<br>support for the ROYG, are privately very skeptical of Saleh's
<br>claims regarding Iranian assistance for the Houthi rebels.
<br>The long absence from Saudi Arabia of Crown Prince Sultan, a
<br>Saleh skeptic who normally heads the Special Office, has
<br>meant that the Yemen file has largely been in the hands of
<br>King Abdullah, a firm supporter of Saleh, according to xxxxx
<br>End summary.
<br>
<br>Saleh relieved by saudi involvement, but still overwhelmed
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) In the past month, President Saleh has told a number
<br>of his top advisors that continued direct Saudi involvement
<br>in the Houthi conflict will alleviate domestic political
<br>pressure on the ROYG to produce tangible gains against the
<br>Houthis, according to xxxxx with close
<br>personal ties to Saleh. Saleh also views continued Saudi
<br>involvement as the key to keeping the tap of Saudi budget
<br>support open (Saudi monetary support for ROYG military
<br>operations will be reported septel). The greater financial
<br>incentives attached to direct Saudi participation in the
<br>conflict mean Saleh now has an incentive to prolong the
<br>conflict rather than seek a mediated solution. (Comment:
<br>xxxxx comments on Saleh's thinking support similar accounts
<br>from other Post contacts reported in REF B. xxxxx speaks
<br>frequently with Saleh, xxxxx. The chummy relationship between
<br>xxxxx that EconOff also attended. End
<br>Comment.)
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Like other Saleh watchers (REF C), xxxxx characterizes
<br>the multitude of threats facing Saleh as qualitatively
<br>different and more threatening to the regime's stability than
<br>those during any other time in Yemen's history. "Saleh is
<br>overwhelmed, exhausted by the war, and more and more
<br>intolerant of internal criticism. Saudi involvement comes at
<br>just the right time for him" xxxxx said. Largely
<br>unprecedented criticism of Saleh's leadership within the
<br>rarified circle of Saleh's closest advisors has increased in
<br>recent months, even including longtime Saleh loyalists such
<br>as Office of the Presidency aides xxxxx, according to xxxxx
<br>These names add to the growing chorus of Saleh loyalists that have shed their
<br>traditional aversion to disparaging the man they call "The
<br>Boss" (REF D).
<br>
<br>Saudis divided on confidence in saleh's sa'ada claims
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Members of the Saudi Government's Special Office for
<br>Yemen Affairs, a committee normally headed by Crown Prince
<br>Sultan, are privately skeptical of Saleh's claims of Iranian
<br>involvement and of his desire to regionalize the Sa'ada
<br>conflict, according to xxxxx told
<br>EconOff on December 14 xxxxx that Saleh was providing false or exaggerated
<br>information on Iranian assistance to the Houthis in order to
<br>enlist direct Saudi involvement and regionalize the conflict.
<br>xxxxx said that xxxxx told him that "we know
<br>Saleh is lying about Iran, but there's nothing we can do
<br>about it now."
<br>
<br>
<br>Sanaa 00002279 002 of 002
<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) The prolonged absence from Saudi Arabia of Special
<br>Office chairman Crown Prince Sultan (REF A), who xxxxx claims
<br>is also highly skeptical of Saleh, left the Yemen file in the
<br>hands of King Abdullah, who has greater confidence in Saleh's
<br>motives and leadership abilities. Committee members have
<br>kept their doubts about Saleh's leadership abilities private
<br>since the departure of Crown Prince Sultan, creating a vacuum
<br>of Yemen policy advice in the Saudi Government that resulted
<br>in the decision to intervene directly in the Houthi conflict,
<br>xxxxx. King Abdullah was much more receptive to
<br>Saleh's entreaties for direct Saudi involvement than Crown
<br>Prince Sultan ever would have been, xxxxx.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) RIYADH COMMENT: We agree with xxxxx observation that
<br>Saudi support is enabling Saleh to weather increased domestic
<br>political pressure and continue his campaign against the
<br>Houthis. However, xxxxx assumption that King Abdullah's
<br>"greater confidence" in Saleh is driving this support may be
<br>flawed. We have seen no evidence that the King has any
<br>particular regard for Saleh beyond exasperation that borders
<br>on disgust. Senior Saudi officials make no secret of their
<br>distaste for Saleh, but see him as the "devil they know."
<br>Aware of his growing weakness, they view their support as
<br>essential to keeping Yemen's problems contained. Further,
<br>contacts say Second Deputy PM and Minister of Interior Prince
<br>Nayif, widely believed to advocate a tougher approach to the
<br>Yemen problem, has been heavily involved in the Yemen file in
<br>Sultan,s absence. Some suggest that the border actions --
<br>while temporarily propping up Saleh -- may be indicative of
<br>Saudi plans to take a harder line towards Yemen in the longer
<br>term. END RIYADH COMMENT.
