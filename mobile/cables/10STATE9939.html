<br> 
<br>Classified By: (U) CLASSIFIED BY EAP DAS DAVID B. SHEAR, 
<br>REASON: 1.4 (C). 
<br> 
<br> ¶1. (U) This is an action request.  Embassy Beijing, please 
<br>see paragraph 3. 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (S) Background/Objective: The U.S. has information 
<br>indicating that in December 2009, the Chinese company Hong 
<br>Kong 4 Star Electronics Ltd. offered to sell gyroscopes 
<br>produced by a Russian company to Iran's Isfahan Optics 
<br>Industries.  Our information indicates that these gyroscopes 
<br>could be delivered to Iran in early February 2010 and that 
<br>Isfahan Optics Industries was coordinating this transaction 
<br>through an intermediary named Iran Business (IBco).  Because 
<br>key missile development organizations in Iran previously have 
<br>attempted to procure similar gyroscopes, we are concerned 
<br>this equipment potentially could be diverted to 
<br>missile-related end-users.  We therefore want to alert 
<br>Chinese officials to this information and ask that they 
<br>investigate this activity with a view to preventing Hong Kong 
<br>4 Star Electronics Ltd. from facilitating missile-related 
<br>exports to Iran. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (S) Action Request:  Request Embassy Beijing approach 
<br>appropriate host government officials to deliver talking 
<br>points/non-paper in paragraph 4 below and report response. 
<br>Talking points also may be provided as a non-paper. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (S) Begin talking points/non-paper: 
<br> 
<br>(SECRET//REL CHINA) 
<br> 
<br>--We would like to alert you to information of proliferation 
<br>concern and request your government's assistance in 
<br>investigating this activity. 
<br> 
<br>--The U.S. has information indicating that in December 2009, 
<br>Hong Kong 4 Star Electronics Ltd., a Chinese company based in 
<br>Futian, China, had offered to sell Iran's Isfahan Optics 
<br>Industries gyroscopes produced by a Russian company. 
<br> 
<br>--Our information indicates that these gyroscopes could be 
<br>delivered to Iran in early February 2010 and that Isfahan 
<br>Optics Industries was coordinating this transaction through 
<br>an intermediary named Iran Business (IBco). 
<br> 
<br>--We are bringing this matter to your attention to support 
<br>your export control efforts as we are concerned this 
<br>equipment potentially could be diverted to missile-related 
<br>end-users in Iran. 
<br> 
<br>--We understand that the Aerospace Industries Organization 
<br>(AIO), which is responsible for overseeing all of Iran's 
<br>missile programs, has previously attempted to procure similar 
<br>gyroscopes. 
<br> 
<br>--We hope you will use this information to investigate this 
<br>activity and take all appropriate measures to ensure that 
<br>Hong Kong 4 Star Electronics Ltd. is not facilitating 
<br>unauthorized exports of missile technology to Iran. 
<br> 
<br>--We believe taking such action would be consistent with 
<br>United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1737 and 1803, 
<br>which require countries to prevent transfers of items to and 
<br>from Iran that could contribute to the development of nuclear 
<br>weapons delivery systems. 
<br> 
<br>--We look forward to continued cooperation on missile 
<br>nonproliferation issues and to hearing of any actions your 
<br>government takes in response to this information. 
<br> 
<br>End talking points/non-paper 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (U) Washington POC is ISN/MTR James Mayes (Phone: 
<br>202-647-3185).  Please slug any reporting on this issue for 
<br>ISN/MTR and EAP/CM. 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (U) A word version of this document will be posted at
