<br>SUBJECT: PRC DEMARCHE ON AMBASSADOR'S LIU XIAOBO LETTER, 
<br>RIGHTS LAWYERS 
<br>
<br>REF: BEIJING 3321 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Acting Political Minister Counselor Eric Barboriak. 
<br>Reasons: 1.4 (b), (d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) On December 21, MFA Americas Department Deputy 
<br>Director General Ding Xiaowen summoned Acting PolMinCouns to 
<br>receive a formal response to a December 10 letter from 
<br>Ambassador Huntsman to Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi raising 
<br>USG concerns about the detention of Charter 08 drafter Liu 
<br>Xiaobo and other human rights issues. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Noting that he would attempt to refrain from "becoming 
<br>emotional," Deputy Director General Ding Xiaowen told Acting 
<br>PolMinCouns that China was strongly dissatisfied and 
<br>registered its firm opposition to Ambassador Huntsman's 
<br>letter and to his December 9 meeting with human rights 
<br>lawyers (reftel). DDG Ding asserted that, during his meeting 
<br>with Jiang Tianyong and four other rights lawyers, Ambassador 
<br>Huntsman had said he would make representations to China to 
<br>safeguard the freedom of religion and legal rights of Chinese 
<br>citizens. In addition, the Ambassador had made inappropriate 
<br>comments in his letter to FM Yang on the handling of specific 
<br>human rights cases including those of Liu Xiaobo and Huang 
<br>Qi. China was firmly opposed to these actions, DDG Ding 
<br>said. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) DDG Ding said that in recent years China had made 
<br>"huge progress on human rights" and that all its citizens 
<br>were equal before the law. In that context, if persons 
<br>violated the law they should be brought to justice, no matter 
<br>who they were or what the situation. Certain "so-called" 
<br>human rights lawyers and dissidents had sought to advance 
<br>their "selfish interests" by attacking the Chinese 
<br>government. It was inappropriate and unacceptable for the 
<br>Ambassador to meet with these types of people, Ding said. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) China was a country "ruled by law" and the cases in 
<br>question would be handled according to law, DDG Ding 
<br>continued. The United States had no right to "point fingers" 
<br>at China and interfere in its internal affairs. The 
<br>bilateral human rights dialogue would take place in February 
<br>and would serve to deepen mutual understanding and reduce 
<br>differences between the United States and China on the basis 
<br>of equality, mutual trust and noninterference in internal 
<br>affairs, DDG said. In order to avoid harm to bilateral 
<br>relations, China called on the United States to respect 
<br>China's judicial sovereignty and to cease using human rights 
<br>as an excuse to "meddle" in China's internal affairs. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Acting PolMinCouns noted that the Ambassador's letter 
<br>reflected the degree of USG concern over the cases of Liu 
<br>Xiaobo, Huang Qi and others. He further noted that, as the 
<br>Secretary had made clear in her December 14 speech, human 
<br>rights remained a key component of U.S. foreign policy. 
<br>Human rights had also been addressed in the joint statement 
<br>by President Obama and President Hu with both sides 
<br>acknowledging internationally recognized rights. The cases 
<br>of Liu Xiaobo and Huang Qi were clear violations of those 
<br>internationally recognized norms. While the U.S. was willing 
<br>to address these issues quietly through diplomatic channels, 
<br>little progress had been achieved and China had not 
<br>acknowledged U.S. concerns. A/PolMinCouns affirmed that the 
<br>Ambassador would continue to meet freely with a range of 
<br>Chinese citizens. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) In a lengthy and disjointed digression, DDG Ding noted 
<br>that he had formerly been Ambassador to Botswana and 
<br>recounted his conversations with the Botswana Foreign 
<br>Minister who told him that the most fundamental human rights 
<br>were the right to food and shelter. While it was true that 
<br>there are fundamental rights of religion, speech and 
<br>assembly, Ding said, "we must not forget the right of human 
<br>dignity and the pursuit of happiness." In this area it was 
<br>"a basic fact" that the PRC had made huge progress in the 
<br>basic welfare of the Chinese people. DDG Ding suggested that 
<br>the United States had not come to China's aid in this respect 
<br>when it had declined to provide spare parts for Blackhawk 
<br>helicopters to assist with relief efforts in the aftermath of 
<br>the Sichuan earthquake. Repeating that human rights cases 
<br>could be "emotional," DDG Ding said the U.S. should seek to 
<br>understand China's position through dialogue. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) A/PolMinCouns replied that the United States agreed 
<br>that dialogue was important and would continue to address 
<br>human rights issue through bilateral consultations. However, 
<br>U.S. concerns over abuses of internally recognized human 
<br>rights norms remained. A/PolMinCouns also pointed out that 
<br>during relief efforts after the Sichuan earthquake, the 
<br>United States, in addition to the other relief assistance it 
<br>
<br>BEIJING 00003416 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>had provided, had offered to arrange airlift support for 
<br>China, an offer which China had rejected.
