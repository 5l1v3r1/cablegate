<br>SUMMARY 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (SBU) The Christian Social Union (CSU) in Bavaria has 
<br>celebrated the outcome of the federal coalition negotiations, 
<br>which awarded the party with three ministries and several 
<br>state secretary positions. The outcome appears to have 
<br>reinvigorated Horst Seehofer, Bavarian Minister President and 
<br>head of the CSU, recovering from a bout with the flu and 
<br>worse-than-expected results in the September 27 national 
<br>elections.  Singling out newly sworn-in Defense Minister zu 
<br>Guttenberg for praise, Seehofer expects him to compete 
<br>successfully for world attention with new Foreign Minister 
<br>and FDP chairman Westerwelle.  Seehofer has signaled that he 
<br>expects to be working with the FDP for a long time.  End 
<br>Summary. 
<br> 
<br>CSU Thrilled with Coalition Negotiations Results 
<br>--------------------------------------------- --- 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (SBU) "We could not be more satisfied with the outcome," 
<br>Michael Hohenberger, a senior State Chancery contact told us 
<br>October 28, adding that "even with a better election result 
<br>the CSU could hardly have emerged stronger in the new 
<br>cabinet."  Although some Bavarian observers have deplored the 
<br>fact that the CSU lost ministerial posts in financial and 
<br>economic affairs at the Federal level, all agree that having 
<br>Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg as Defense Minister is a very 
<br>positive development.  A CSU party senior advisor, Christian 
<br>Kattner, told us privately on the same day that he could 
<br>"understand Chancellor Merkel's point in giving the Finance 
<br>Ministry at this difficult time to an experienced man like 
<br>(former Interior Minister) Wolfgang Schaeuble (Christian 
<br>Democratic Union ) CDU) rather than to a young man at the 
<br>beginning of his political career." 
<br>¶3.  (C) Kattner insisted that the CSU had left its mark with 
<br>regard to substance.  M-P Seehofer had promised tax cuts, 
<br>which are now in the works, and aid measures for farmers, for 
<br>which he obtained an agreement on public aid amounting to 700 
<br>million Euros.  The CDU/CSU stood united in rejecting FDP 
<br>demands they considered too business friendly at the expense 
<br>of social justice concerns, he said.  Bavarian Justice 
<br>Minister Merk, who at the beginning of the coalition 
<br>negotiations expressed concerns about FDP "weaknesses" on 
<br>internal security and counterterrorism, told the CG October 
<br>27 that "she was very comfortable with the results." 
<br>Strong CSU Bavarian Line-Up in Berlin 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (SBU) As for the Cabinet, in addition to zu Guttenberg at 
<br>Defense, there is Peter Ramsauer heading the Transportation 
<br>Ministry, where he will have national influence and a huge 
<br>budget.  Ilse Aigner (CSU) remains Minister of Agriculture. 
<br>Five of the the parliamentarian State Secretaries are 
<br>Bavarian, four from the CSU r and one from the FDP.  This 
<br>gives the CSU and Bavaria generally important influence at 
<br>the sub-Cabinet level and sets up influential and direct 
<br>Bavarian connections between the Bundestag and Cabinet.  In 
<br>the Defense Ministry, well-respected Christian Schmidt 
<br>retained his position, as did Gerd Mueller in Agriculture. 
<br>Hartmut Koschyk moves to the Finance Ministry, providing the 
<br>CSU with important direct influence with Minister Schaeuble. 
<br>The 35-year old Andreas Scheuer from Passau will assist Peter 
<br>Ramsauer at the Transportation Ministry.  The fifth Bavarian 
<br>is Max Stadler (FDP), who will support Sabine 
<br>Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger (FDP) at the Justice Ministry.  A 
<br>well-respected lawyer from Passau, Stadler is an excellent 
<br>choice and a real legal expert with American experience as a 
<br>1993 International Visitor Program alumnus. 
<br>Seehofer Expects Long-Term Cooperation with FDP 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -- 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (SBU) At the CSU party convention on October 26, where 
<br>the coalition agreement was approved, MP Seehofer made clear 
<br>that the CSU,s main rival will now be the FDP, "which no 
<br>longer is a small party but clearly intends to become a 
<br>people,s party," he said, predicting "they will be targeting 
<br>the same voters as the CSU."  The CSU, he added, will have to 
<br>act as the guardian of the little people "to ensure that 
<br> 
<br>MUNICH 00000273  002 OF 002 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>social justice prevails."  Later, upon signing the coalition 
<br>agreement in Berlin, Seehofer indicated that he intends to 
<br>remain in the CSU leadership.  Noting that this was the 
<br>second time he had signed an agreement with the FDP, 
<br>following the agreement in Bavaria one year earlier, he said 
<br>he might be able to do the same again for the third and 
<br>fourth time in 2013.  The media jumped on this statement 
<br>since it insinuated that Seehofer had given up hope of  the 
<br>CSU regaining its absolute majority in the 2013 Bavarian 
<br>state elections.  "This statement might come back to haunt 
<br>him," one journalist commented. 
<br> 
<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (C) Bavarian leaders are strong at home and in Berlin. 
<br>Contrary to media speculation, Horst Seehofer remains 
<br>uncontested as CSU chairman and Bavarian Minister-President. 
<br>Our contacts in the party, State Chancery and CSU caucus 
<br>unanimously rejected speculation about an imminent revolt 
<br>against his leadership, although several acknowledge there 
<br>will be discussions of a possible change in 2011 in 
<br>preparation for the next Bavarian election in 2013.  In the 
<br>capital, Defense Minister zu Guttenberg will be a serious 
<br>competitor to Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle on the 
<br>diplomatic parquet.  In foreign and security affairs, zu 
<br>Guttenberg is better connected in Washington, fluent in 
<br>English, and more experienced in the key issues.  Moreover, 
<br>his good relations with the USG, which started in Bavaria, 
<br>extend beyond the Department of State to the Department of 
<br>Defense and Congress, notably through the vehicle of the 
<br>annual Munich Security Conference (next iteration February 
<br>5-7, 2010), where he is a regular and prominent organizer and 
<br>participant.
