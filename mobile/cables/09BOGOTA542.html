<br>
<br>SUMMARY 
<br>-------- 
<br>¶1. (C) The Defense Ministry (MOD) continues to step up 
<br>investigations into reports of murders committed by Army 
<br>personnel, and has fired fifty-one officers and enlisted men 
<br>implicated in the incidents--including 27 dismissed as a 
<br>result of the Soacha murders. The MOD is also working to fix 
<br>breakdowns in intelligence, operational planning and 
<br>logistics that contribute to human rights abuses, as well as 
<br>to implement clearer rules of engagement. Still, some senior 
<br>military officials continue to resist the MOD's efforts, 
<br>arguing that human rights concerns are overstated and that 
<br>the new policies are harming the war effort. Army Commander 
<br>General Oscar Gonzalez has impeded investigations of abuses 
<br>by limiting the mandate of the Army Inspector General. With 
<br>Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos likely to depart soon to 
<br>launch his presidential campaign, senior military and 
<br>civilian officials say it is key that President Uribe appoint 
<br>a Minister equally committed to human rights if the current 
<br>progress is to be maintained. End Summary 
<br>
<br>MOD IMPLEMENTS CORRECTIVE MEASURES 
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br>¶2. (C) Since October 2008, the MOD has dismissed fifty-one 
<br>officers and enlisted men implicated in extrajudicial 
<br>killings: 27 Army personnel were fired in October 2008 for 
<br>the Soacha killings; 13 more were dismissed in November 2008 
<br>for murders in Cordoba; and 11 others were dismissed from La 
<br>Popa Battalion in January 2009 for killings in Cesar. In 
<br>addition to the investigations, the MOD is implementing the 
<br>15-point plan announced by MOD Santos in November 2008 to 
<br>improve the military's human rights record and deter abuses 
<br>(see reftel A). The MOD is developing clearer rules of 
<br>military engagement and is designating those criminal bands 
<br>that are legitimate military targets and those that should be 
<br>subject to law enforcement action. The GOC also modified an 
<br>internal directive regulating rewards payments to informants 
<br>to avoid situations such as the "Rojas" case where the GOC 
<br>paid for FARC Secretariat member Ivan Rios' hand (and later 
<br>his corpse). 
<br>
<br>IG'S MANDATE LIMITED 
<br>-------------------- 
<br>¶3. (C) Army Inspector General (IG) Major General Carlos 
<br>Suarez, who was made IG by MOD Santos with the specific 
<br>mandate to investigate extrajudicial killings, told us on 
<br>February 13 that he and two trusted members of his team are 
<br>the only personnel who investigate alleged murders committed 
<br>killings by Army personnel. The investigations follow the 
<br>model used by Suarez in investigating the Soacha murders, and 
<br>examine the operational, intelligence, logistical and 
<br>administrative components of supposed military operations. 
<br>Suarez clarified that his role is not criminal or 
<br>disciplinary, but rather administrative. He cannot dismiss 
<br>any personnel on his own, and can only make recommendations 
<br>to the Army Commander, Armed Forces Commander, or the MOD. 
<br>For example, he recommended that 28 Army officers and other 
<br>personnel be dismissed from the Popa Battalion due to their 
<br>alleged roles in killings in Cesar, but Army Commander Oscar 
<br>Gonzalez approved the removal of only 11 officers. 
<br>
<br>PROBLEM WIDESPREAD AND BAD TACTICS 
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br>¶4. (C) Suarez said the extrajudicial execution problem was 
<br>widespread. He stated that the Soacha phenomenon originated 
<br>in the 4th Brigade in Medellin (commanded at one time by both 
<br>former Army Commander Mario Montoya and current Army 
<br>Commander Oscar Gonzalez). The practice later spread to 
<br>other brigades and commands in the region, including the 
<br>Joint Caribbean Command. Suarez said the insistence by some 
<br>military commanders on body counts as a measure of success 
<br>despite MOD directives to the contrary--coupled with some 
<br>commanders' ties to criminals and narcotraffickers--led to 
<br>the specific pattern of murders committed in the Soacha and 
<br>other cases. He noted that the body count system--and the 
<br>resulting murders--not only undermined the Army's legitimacy, 
<br>but also created a false illusion of success. As a result, 
<br>the "false positives" diverted resources and attention away 
<br>from the main fight against the FARC. 
<br>
<br>SENIOR LEVEL RESISTANCE TO CHANGE 
<br>--------------------------------- 
<br>¶5. (C) Suarez said he continues to enjoy the support of MOD 
<br>Santos, Vice Minister of Defense Sergio Jaramillo, and Armed 
<br>Forces Commander Freddy Padilla. Still, he faces resistance 
<br>from some active duty officers supported by a group of 
<br>retired generals and right-wing politicians. Suarez noted 
<br>that he was imposed on Army Commander Gonzalez by Padilla, 
<br>and that Gonzalez opposes his work. He acknowledged that 
<br>Gonzalez tried to intimidate witnesses not to testify about 
<br>murders committed by the 11th Brigade in Sucre, and said 
<br>Gonzalez tries to limit his office's resources.
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX echoed Suarez's comments, 
<br>noting that Gonzalez has transferred personnel from Suarez's 
<br>office, reduced his bodyguard contingent, and tried to 
<br>restrict the IG's mandate. Suarez added that his family has 
<br>received indirect threats due to his work. His staff is 
<br>searching for an email allegedly circulating within the 
<br>military which shows photos of the members of the MOD 
<br>Commission that investigated the Soacha murders with X's 
<br>drawn through them. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Beyond the military, Suarez said retired generals such 
<br>as Montoya and former 17th Brigade Commander Rito Alejo del 
<br>Rio are working with right-wing politicians like former 
<br>Minister Fernando Londono to undercut Santos' human rights 
<br>initiatives. He cited a February 12 "El Tiempo" Op-ed in 
<br>which Londono complained that the dismissals over the 
<br>so-called "false positives" had emasculated the military, 
<br>leaving officers too scared to conduct operations and 
<br>returning the tactical initiative to the FARC. Jaramillo 
<br>told us that some officers are mounting a campaign involving 
<br>legal action, intimidation, and slander to harass those 
<br>officers and civilians committed to cleaning up the Army. 
<br>Jaramillo noted that former Colonel Mejia--who faces criminal 
<br>charges for his role in the La Popa murders--has filed 
<br>complaints with the Inspector General's Office (Procuraduria) 
<br>against him and Prosecutor General Human Rights Office 
<br>director Sandra Castro for allegedly forcing witnesses to 
<br>testify against him. 
<br>
<br>BATTLE OVER URIBE'S EAR 
<br>----------------------- 
<br>¶7. (C) Suarez observed that President Uribe continues to view 
<br>military success in terms of kills, leaving him susceptible 
<br>to the arguments of some military officers and politicians 
<br>that the MOD's emphasis on human rights is overstated and is 
<br>harming the war effort against the FARC. Jaramillo confirmed 
<br>that the group's arguments are gaining some traction with 
<br>Uribe. Suarez said the President needs to understand that 
<br>the previous enemy combat death reports included many 
<br>non-FARC, creating a misleading view of progress and 
<br>promoting both bad tactics and officers. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Suarez and Jaramillo discounted charges that the 
<br>Soacha investigations and other MOD human rights initiatives 
<br>are discouraging military operations against the FARC, noting 
<br>that the Army units which have achieved the greatest results 
<br>against the terrorist group were not involved in the murders. 
<br>Suarez said Army Operations Chief Major General Carlos 
<br>Saavedra agrees that the human rights impact on operations 
<br>has been minimal (Embassy's own analysis supports Suarez and 
<br>Saavedra's conclusions. See reftel B). Still, Suarez and 
<br>Jaramillo said that with MOD Santos likely to depart soon to 
<br>launch his presidential campaign, President Uribe's choice of 
<br>the next MOD will be key. If the next MOD does not share 
<br>Santos' strong human rights commitment, the progress achieved 
<br>to date could be reversed.
