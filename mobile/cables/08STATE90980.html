<br>SUBJECT: GEORGIA: REBUTTING SPURIOUS RUSSIAN CLAIMS 
<br>REGARDING THE CEASEFIRE AGREEMENT 
<br>
<br>Classified by EUR A/S Daniel Fried; reason: 1.4 (b) and 
<br>(d). 
<br>
<br>Ref: Moscow 2522 (NOTAL) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (U) This is an action request for all posts, see end 
<br>of para 2. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Reftel lays out Russian efforts to misinterpret 
<br>the August 12 Georgia ceasefire agreement mediated by 
<br>French President Sarkozy. Among other things, Russia is 
<br>claiming that the ceasefire allows for creation of a 
<br>?buffer zone? around South Ossetia, gives Russian forces 
<br>unlimited rights to "implement additional security 
<br>measures" in and outside of South Ossetia, and allows 
<br>Russia to "blue helmet" an unlimited number of forces to 
<br>implement these additional security measures. ACTION 
<br>REQUEST: These Russian assertions are blatantly false, 
<br>and posts should strongly rebut them with host country 
<br>officials and media, using the facts laid out in the 
<br>following paragraphs. As the French negotiated these 
<br>documents and are in the lead in ensuring that they are 
<br>being carried out, Posts should not take the initiative 
<br>in deploying these points (i.e. public releases, opeds, 
<br>other press, diplomatic demarches), but rather draw on 
<br>them immediately if/when issues related to Georgia are 
<br>raised by host governments, media, etc., as well as in 
<br>explaining our larger Georgia policies. END ACTION 
<br>REQUEST. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) Posts should be careful not to openly 
<br>characterize President Sarkozy’s or other French 
<br>positions, but rather provide factual information. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) Sarkozy made clear in his August 14 letter to 
<br>Georgian President Saakashvili and in supplementary 
<br>paragraphs attached to that letter that "?additional 
<br>security measures" are limited to "patrols" (not a 
<br>?buffer zone? or even checkpoints) by Russian 
<br>peacekeeping forces that were in South Ossetia prior to 
<br>the outbreak of hostilities on August 7, and that these 
<br>patrols are limited to an area "not further than a few 
<br>kilometers" outside of South Ossetia, excluding other 
<br>parts of Georgia, the city of Gori and other significant 
<br>urban zones, and must not impede freedom of movement on 
<br>major highways and railways. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) Russia?s actions and statements in recent days 
<br>raises suspicions that it does not intend to respect 
<br>these restrictions on its forces in Georgia, and is in 
<br>fact angling to retain a larger zone of control than 
<br>held prior to the invasion. These actions include 
<br>Russian forces -- not peacekeepers from pre-August 7 -- 
<br>digging into positions in and around Poti (200 
<br>kilometers from South Ossetia), north of Gori and other 
<br>locations outside the zone prescribed for patrols; 
<br>Russian military checkpoints impeding movements at the 
<br>port of Poti, near the main East-West highway, and near 
<br>Gori and other urban areas; and continued Russian 
<br>destruction of civilian and military infrastructure. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (U) Posts are encouraged to review the following 
<br>documents: the August 12 ceasefire agreement, the August 
<br>14 letter from Sarkozy to Saakashvili, and the 
<br>supplemental paragraphs attached to the August 14 
<br>letter. All of these documents are now in the public 
<br>domain. These documents are also available at 
<br>www.intelink.sgov.gov/wiki/Portal:Crisis_Geor gia . 
<br>
<br>¶7. (U) Begin text of August 12 ceasefire agreement: 
<br>
<br>Agreed Protocol 
<br>
<br>(1) No resort to force. 
<br>
<br>(2) A definitive halt to hostilities. 
<br>
<br>(3) Provision of free access for humanitarian 
<br>assistance. 
<br>
<br>(4) Georgian military forces must withdraw to the 
<br>places they are usually stationed. 
<br>
<br>(5) Russian forces must withdraw to their positions 
<br>prior to the outbreak of hostilities. While awaiting an 
<br>international mechanism, Russian peacekeeping forces 
<br>will implement additional security measures. 
<br>
<br>(6) Opening of international discussions on security 
<br>and stability modalities in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. 
<br>
<br>For the European Union, 
<br>The French Presidency

<br>¶8. (U) Begin text of Sarkozy letter to Saakashvili: 
<br>
<br>Paris, 14 August 2008 
<br>
<br>Mister President: 
<br>
<br>Regarding point 5 of the six-point accord to which you ? 
<br>after President Medvedev ? gave your approval 12 August 
<br>during our meeting in Tbilisi, and which states that 
<br>"Russian military forces should withdraw to positions 
<br>prior to the outbreak of hostilities"? and that "while 
<br>waiting for an international mechanism, Russian forces 
<br>will implement additional security measures," I wish to 
<br>share with you the following points for the sake of 
<br>precision: 
<br>
<br>-- As I made clear at our joint press conference in 
<br>Tbilisi, these "additional security measures" may only 
<br>be implemented in the immediate proximity of South 
<br>Ossetia to the exclusion of any other part of Georgian 
<br>territory. 
<br>
<br>-- More precisely, these "measures"? may only be 
<br>implemented inside a zone of a depth of a few kilometers 
<br>from the administrative limit between South Ossetia and 
<br>the rest of Georgia in a manner such that no significant 
<br>urban zone would be included ? I am thinking in 
<br>particular of the city of Gori. Special arrangements 
<br>must be defined to guarantee the liberty of movement and 
<br>traffic along the length of the major highways and 
<br>railways of Georgia. 
<br>
<br>-- These "additional security measures"? will take the 
<br>form of patrols undertaken solely by Russian 
<br>peacekeeping forces at a level authorized by existing 
<br>agreements, with other Russian forces withdrawing to 
<br>their positions prior to 7 August in conformity with the 
<br>agreed protocol; 
<br>
<br>-- These "measures" will have a provisional character 
<br>while awaiting the establishment as quickly as possible 
<br>of the ?international mechanism? whose nature and 
<br>mandate are still the subject of discussion by different 
<br>international entities, in particular the OSCE, the 
<br>European Union, and the United Nations. 
<br>
<br>Armed with these points of precision, I ask that you 
<br>confirm the agreement that you gave me and that you 
<br>announced publicly in Tbilisi while affixing your 
<br>signature at the bottom of the six-point agreed protocol 
<br>that I had myself signed as a witness and guarantor in 
<br>the name of the European Union. President Medvedev 
<br>yesterday assured me that your signature would lead to 
<br>the withdrawal of Russian forces pursuant to the accord 
<br>concluded. 
<br>
<br>I ask that you accept, Mister President, the assurance 
<br>of my highest consideration. 
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>¶9. (U) Begin text of supplementary paragraphs attached 
<br>to August 14 Sarkozy letter to Saakashvili: 
<br>
<br>-- In the letter accompanying the cease-fire document, 
<br>the mentioned territory is defined as in the immediate 
<br>proximity of the zone of conflict, as defined by 
<br>previous agreements, to the exclusion of any other part 
<br>of Georgian territory. Any measure referred to in this 
<br>document shall be implemented within an area not further 
<br>than a few kilometers, around Tskhinvali within the zone 
<br>of conflict. 
<br>
<br>-- In no way can these measures limit or jeopardize 
<br>freedom of movement and traffic along the length of the 
<br>major highways and railways of Georgia. 
<br>
<br>-- Other aspects of the conflict resolution process will 
<br>be discussed in the near future.
