<br> 
<br>------- 
<br>SUMMARY 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>1.(S) In a visit to Israel on 16-17 November, Treasury Under 
<br>Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Stuart A. 
<br>Levey, reassured GOI officials that no momentum would be lost 
<br>in USG efforts to combat terrorist financing or to pressure 
<br>Iran during the transition to a new US administration in 
<br>January. In meetings with Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, 
<br>Mossad Director Meir Dagan, National Security Council 
<br>Chairman Dani Arditi, and others, U/S Levey emphasized recent 
<br>U.S. designations against the Union of Good, the Islamic 
<br>Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL), and the recent 
<br>revocation of Iran's "U-Turn" license. In response to GOI 
<br>officials' pressure to have the U.S. designate the Central 
<br>Bank of Iran (CBI), Levey underscored the importance of 
<br>international, multilateral concurrence for such an effort to 
<br>be a success. 
<br> 
<br>2.(S) Israeli officials were keen to outline an "escalation" 
<br>in CBI programs that they believed pose a danger to the 
<br>international financial system. Several key Israeli officials 
<br>identified Reza Raei, Vice Governor of the CBI, as a key 
<br>figure in masterminding new ways to help the Iranian 
<br>commercial and banking sectors circumvent sanctions. Levey 
<br>promised to continue pushing the Gulf states on adopting 
<br>stronger regulation until the last day of his appointment. 
<br> 
<br>3.(S) Mossad Chief Meir Dagan informed Levey that sanctions 
<br>were beginning to have a negative effect on Iran's regime. 
<br>NSC Chairman Arditi also told him that the PA was performing 
<br>well in its renewed fight against terror finance in the West 
<br>Bank. END SUMMARY. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----- 
<br>GOI CONCERNED ABOUT COUNTER TERROR FINANCE POLICY CONTINUITY 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----- 
<br> 
<br>4.(S) National Security Council (NCS) Chairman, Dani Arditi, 
<br>in a November 16 meeting with U/S Stuart Levey, asked whether 
<br>Levey thought his efforts would continue into the next U.S. 
<br>administration. Even though he said he planned to resign as 
<br>required in January, Levey told Arditi that he believed the 
<br>Obama team would be committed to continuing the ambitious 
<br>program against terrorism finance that he has shepherded over 
<br>the last several years. Saying counter- terrorism finance was 
<br>not a partisan issue in the U.S., Levey subsequently 
<br>confirmed these sentiments to Foreign Minister (FM) Tzipi 
<br>Livni and Mossad Director Meir Dagan in separate meetings 
<br>that occurred on the following day, November 17. 
<br> 
<br>---------------------- 
<br>IRAN/NON-PROLIFERATION 
<br>---------------------- 
<br> 
<br>5.(S) On November 16, Levey outlined for Ministry of Foreign 
<br>Affairs Deputy Director General for Strategic Affairs Alon 
<br>Bar, and Senior Deputy Director General Yossi Gal positive 
<br>developments in the Iran effort. He told them that Treasury 
<br>had been very successful in curtailing business with Iran by 
<br>most "major players". Levey said that expanding the 
<br>non-proliferation strategy into insurance, and putting 
<br>pressure on Iran's oil refining capacity and Liquid Natural 
<br>Gas (LNG) industry were next steps being pursued. He also 
<br>reported that the recent IRISL designation has been unusually 
<br>effective. 
<br> 
<br>CBI's Reza Raei Masterminds New Methods 
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>6.(S) During their November 16 meeting, Arditi told Levey 
<br>that the Israeli intelligence community has continued to see 
<br>an escalation in CBI efforts to help designated Iranian 
<br>commercial banks circumvent international and U.S. sanctions. 
<br> The NSC Chairman presented several recent examples of CBI 
<br>behavior that he characterized as unusual for a central bank. 
<br>Arditi identified Reza Raei, Vice Governor of the CBI for 
<br>Foreign Exchange Affairs, as the mastermind of these new 
<br> 
<br>TEL AVIV 00002760  002 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>efforts. 
<br> 
<br>7.(S) Meir Dagan subsequently told Levey that the CBI had 
<br>engineered a way for the UN-designated Iranian bank Sepah to 
<br>conduct foreign business transactions through use of the 
<br>Iranian Postal Bank. Bank Melli, a USG-designated bank, had 
<br>also purchased shares in investment funds as a way to escape 
<br>the effects of the sanctions, according to Dagan. Using these 
<br>methods, Melli and Sepah have been able to fabricate a method 
<br>of providing correspondent-like banking services to 
<br>designated Iranian banks that find it increasingly difficult 
<br>to deal in foreign currency. Arditi named the "Persia Equity 
<br>Fund" as one such financial instrument being used by Melli. 
<br>Levey commented that any such investment fund or financial 
<br>instrument could be listed as a derivative designation of 
<br>Melli if enough evidence could be shown linking the two 
<br>organizations. Levey told Meir Dagan that he was in favor of 
<br>pursuing a designation of Raei if GOI allegations were 
<br>accurate. 
<br> 
<br>No International Support for Designation of the CBI 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
<br> 
<br>8.(S) Arditi and subsequently, Dagan, asked Levey whether the 
<br>USG was considering a designation of the CBI. Although 
<br>Treasury had looked into the possibility, said Levey, a 
<br>designation of the CBI would be ineffective without a 
<br>multilateral effort. International support for such an effort 
<br>simply did not yet exist, Levey explained. He told Dagan that 
<br>we need to build support by sharing info about the CBI's 
<br>illicit conduct, similar to the support we built for cutting 
<br>off the U-turn license. Levey said that it would be better to 
<br>focus on limiting other central and commercial banks' 
<br>business with the CBI. Noting that the banking industry 
<br>relies heavily on reputation, Levey told Arditi that the 
<br>right strategy is to continue exposing the illicit activities 
<br>of Iranian banks and banking officials. 
<br> 
<br>European Banks' Business with Iran 
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>9.(S) MFA interlocutors revisited the progress of European 
<br>banks in non-proliferation efforts. In a November 16 meeting 
<br>with Yossi Gal, Senior Deputy Director General, and Alon Bar, 
<br>Deputy Director General for Strategic Affairs, Gal raised 
<br>concerns that Italy and Germany were falling short in their 
<br>commitment to enforce sanctions within their banking sectors. 
<br>Gal told Levey that the MFA was planning a visit to Italy in 
<br>December, but was unsure whether its attempt to persuade the 
<br>politicians would filter down to action within the 
<br>bureaucracy. Gal expressed the same concern about the banking 
<br>sector in Germany, saying that resistance from the 
<br>bureaucracy and the private sector often undermined attempts 
<br>by political figures to improve German regulation. Bar and 
<br>Gal encouraged Levey to join the GOI in pressing the 
<br>governments and banking sectors of Germany and Italy to do 
<br>more. 
<br> 
<br>Cautious Optimism on Gulf States 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>10.(S) On the status of UAE efforts to stem Iranian finance, 
<br>Levey told Gal and Bar that he was optimistic about the 
<br>country's efforts. Among other examples, he mentioned that 
<br>the UAE had decreased the number of visas it was issuing to 
<br>Iranian nationals and that Emirati ministers were receptive 
<br>to his requests for increased banking regulation. 
<br> 
<br>11.(S) FM Livni told Levey that Israel continues to encourage 
<br>the Gulf states to more publicly outline their actions 
<br>against Iranian finance within their banking sectors despite 
<br>the countries' reasons for keeping such actions secretive. 
<br>She asked Levey to join in this effort. Levey affirmed that 
<br>the USG was encouraging sanctions in all sectors and posited 
<br>that the Iranians were beginning to feel the pressure. Livni 
<br>asked if the declining price of oil was becoming leverage in 
<br>the efforts to thwart Iranian financial efforts. Levey said 
<br>that it was and that the Iranian private sector was becoming 
<br>more vocal in its criticisms of the government. 
<br> 
<br>12.(S) Levey outlined for his GOI interlocutors recent 
<br> 
<br>TEL AVIV 00002760  003 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>efforts by Treasury to broaden its sanctioning of Iran to the 
<br>shipping, insurance, and reinsurance industries. He cited the 
<br>designation of IRISL as a positive first step and mentioned 
<br>that Treasury had found willing partners in Europe and the UK 
<br>to further efforts in this area. 
<br> 
<br>Effect of Sanctions on Iran 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>13.(S) Dagan told Levey that the economic problems Iran is 
<br>experiencing as a result of sanctions are encouraging debate 
<br>within the regime. He said that in order to preserve the 
<br>revolution, some key figures have begun to consider the need 
<br>for change. The pressure is on, Dagan said, but he could not 
<br>estimate when Iran would hit the brink. He noted that the 
<br>lower cost of oil at the moment would likely prompt Iran to 
<br>increase its production, thereby encouraging more business 
<br>through the CBI. With oil prices low everywhere, however, 
<br>Dagan and Levey agreed that Iran was a less attractive place 
<br>for investment. Levey told Dagan that the present low oil 
<br>prices provide a critical opportunity to convince other 
<br>members of the international community to apply more 
<br>pressure. 
<br> 
<br>14.(S) Livni asked Levey if there was a risk of Iran 
<br>regaining a foothold in certain markets as a result of the 
<br>world financial crisis. Levey said that the market turmoil 
<br>has worked to the USG's advantage: the crisis has made 
<br>financial institutions even more risk-averse, thereby 
<br>lessening Iran's attractiveness even further. Additionally, 
<br>while Iran's banks are isolated, its economy is not. 
<br> 
<br>U.S. Engagement with Iran 
<br>------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>15.(S) FM Livni asked Levey during their November 17 meeting 
<br>why the USG was considering a rapprochement with Iran through 
<br>a U.S. Interests section in Tehran. She questioned whether 
<br>the tactic would have a net positive outcome when measured 
<br>against the negative perceptions such a move would be bound 
<br>to create. Levey told Livni that this was a question better 
<br>posed to the State Department, but that her concern was the 
<br>central issue being debated by policy makers in Washington. 
<br>In Levey's previous meeting with MFA officials Bar and Gal, 
<br>he said that engagement with Iran would not work without 
<br>leverage, indicating that sanctions would need to be in place 
<br>no matter what the USG decides to do. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
<br>STEMMING PALESTINIAN TERROR FINANCE: GOI PLEASED WITH PA'S 
<br>PROGRESS 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
<br> 
<br>16.(S) Levey told Arditi that Treasury's recent designation 
<br>of the "Union of Good" was proof of the USG's commitment to 
<br>continue to work against Hamas and Palestinian terrorists. 
<br>Levey said, however, that while the USG supported efforts at 
<br>thwarting terrorism in the territories, the USG wished to 
<br>keep humanitarian goods flowing to the needy within the 
<br>population. 
<br> 
<br>17.(S) Arditi told Levey that Palestinian Authority (PA) 
<br>efforts at stemming terrorism within the territories were 
<br>going quite well. He said the PA's positive efforts 
<br>"surprised" his staff and that he "never thought" the PA 
<br>would do so well. Levey said that Treasury coordinated with 
<br>Prime Minister Fayyad on the Union of Good designation and 
<br>was pleased to hear that PA efforts were held in high regard 
<br>by the GOI. 
<br> 
<br>18.(S) When Levey inquired about efforts to prevent 
<br>correspondent banking relations in Gaza from being severed, 
<br>Arditi said that the Postal Bank "was on the agenda". Arditi 
<br>lamented that the services provided by the Postal Bank would 
<br>not be as good because of its small size and limited 
<br>capacity. He expressed his hope that the central bank 
<br>governor would be able to delay the commercial banks' 
<br>decision to end their relationship with the Palestinians 
<br>until a permanent solution was ensured. 
<br> 
<br>19.(S) This cable has been cleared by Under Secretary Stuart 
<br> 
<br>TEL AVIV 00002760  004 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Levey.
