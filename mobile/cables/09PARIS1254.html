<br>SUBJECT: A/S GORDON'S MEETINGS WITH POLICY-MAKERS IN PARIS: 
<br>A TOUR D'HORIZON OF EUROPE AND AFGHANISTAN 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Charles Rivkin, for reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (S) Summary.  During Assistant Secretary Gordon's visit 
<br>to Paris on September 11, he met with a number of French 
<br>policy-makers including: Elysee Diplomatic Advisors 
<br>Jean-David Levitte, Damien Loras, and Francois Richier, 
<br>Assistant Secretary equivalent for Continental Europe Roland 
<br>Galharague, and Acting Director of MFA Strategic Affairs 
<br>bureau Jean-Hugues Simon-Michel.  Discussions focused on 
<br>Russia, upcoming developments in the Balkans (Bosnia, 
<br>Croatia, Macedonia and Kosovo), elections in Germany and 
<br>Afghanistan, Turkey's EU Accession, NATO Enlargement and 
<br>Strategic Concept, and Georgia and Ukraine.  End Summary. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br>AFGHANISTAN: A MAJOR PRIORITY 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (C) Jean-David Levitte noted that while public opinion in 
<br>France is opposed to the war in Afghanistan, the situation 
<br>here is much calmer than in the UK, Germany, or Italy. 
<br>Angela Merkel's domestic political situation after the 
<br>incident in Kunduz was particularly fragile, so that was part 
<br>of the rationale behind the recent German-French-UK letter to 
<br>UN SYG Ban Ki Moon to propose an international conference on 
<br>Afghanistan by the end of the year.  Levitte said that the 
<br>goal of the conference would be to accelerate and improve the 
<br>training of Afghan troops and police and to strengthen Afghan 
<br>state institutions, which will help reinforce the importance 
<br>of the international effort to skeptical publics.  They are 
<br>now waiting for Ban Ki Moon's response.  Levitte emphasized 
<br>that France remains "totally engaged" in Afghanistan with no 
<br>limits or caveats on its troops.  This autumn, France will 
<br>complete a transfer of troops from Kabul to Kapisa and Surobi 
<br>provinces (a presence that will be reinforced on the ground 
<br>as France reassigns some sailors to other regional activities 
<br>and replaces them with ground troops).  A/S Gordon assured 
<br>Levitte that the U.S. would soon be able to share the 
<br>elements of the McChrystal military review with Allies. 
<br>Levitte responded by praising General McChrystal and saying 
<br>that French forces have an excellent dialogue with him on the 
<br>ground.  He added that Germany and the UK are determined to 
<br>stay in Afghanistan as needed, but we may need to convince 
<br>the Netherlands to remain, and that President Sarkozy had 
<br>recently reinforced this message in a meeting with Dutch PM 
<br>Balkenende. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------------------- 
<br>BOSNIA: FRENCH URGE TRANFER TO EU AUTHORITY 
<br>------------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C) Levitte noted that of the five major conditions 
<br>required to transfer authority in Bosnia from the UN High 
<br>Representative to an EU High Representative, four have been 
<br>fulfilled, and only the question of division of state 
<br>property remains.  This final condition should not alone 
<br>"block all progress," especially as the current UN team in 
<br>Bosnia is no longer effective.  France wants to see the 
<br>transfer of authority to a new EU team in November, as the 
<br>rapprochement to Europe is an effective "carrot" to encourage 
<br>the Bosniaks to continue progress in necessary reforms.  A/S 
<br>Gordon agreed that the current system is not working well, 
<br>but noted that the international community will lose 
<br>credibility if we move forward before all the necessary 
<br>pre-conditions have been fulfilled.  He added that the U.S. 
<br>agrees that some form of carrot is necessary to urge Bosnian 
<br>compliance.  Levitte noted that they still have two months to 
<br>urge Bosnian progress before a final decision is made.  In a 
<br>separate meeting, Assistant Secretary equivalent for 
<br>Continental Europe Roland Galharague said that "transition is 
<br>the number one objective," suggested the division of state 
<br>property will take much time to resolve, and urged the U.S. 
<br>to support early transfer of authority that would open the 
<br>door to Bosnian aspirations for greater integration into EU 
<br>institutions.  He noted that the growing perception of 
<br>divisions between the US and Bosniaks on one side who favored 
<br>retaining the UN role and the EU and Serbs on the other 
<br>created unhelpful opportunities for manipulation.  A/S Gordon 
<br>said this perception was inaccurate, but noted the U.S. is 
<br>sensitive to the political need for Bosniak leaders to sell 
<br>this decision to their publics.  The USG needs to see a clear 
<br>path ahead for transition in order to support it. 
<br> 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br>KOSOVO AND SERBIA 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (C) Levitte noted that the EULEX mission is having 
<br>diplomatic problems with the Kosovar government and public 
<br> 
<br>PARIS 00001254  002 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>after signing two technical protocols with Serbia.  They are 
<br>hoping to ensure continued calm as Kosovo heads into 
<br>municipal elections.  A/S Gordon stated that the Kosovars 
<br>will have to accept the protocols but that it should be 
<br>clearly explained that these are technical agreements that 
<br>have no impact on Kosovo's independent status.  Levitte also 
<br>criticized Serbian FM Jeremic, saying that he is doing 
<br>nothing to encourage Serb return or participation in Kosovo's 
<br>government.  Levitte noted that Jeremic "makes big promises" 
<br>every time he comes to France, but doesn't follow through. 
<br>Levitte no longer meets with him and does not consider him to 
<br>be the "modern face of Belgrade" that he purports to be. 
<br> 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br>MACEDONIA AND CROATIA 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (C) Levitte expressed optimism that a new Greek 
<br>government would be "more solid" and allow greater 
<br>flexibility for progress in the Greek-Macedonian name 
<br>dispute.  A/S Gordon agreed that either a more solid 
<br>Conservative government or a Socialist government would be a 
<br>stronger, more flexible partner in the negotiations.  He 
<br>expressed hope that if the international community could 
<br>convince Macedonia to abandon the idea of a referendum and 
<br>get Greece to abandon the necessity of changing passports, 
<br>then progress could be made.  On Croatia, Levitte observed 
<br>that the border issue with Slovenia is making progress.  He 
<br>hoped that the upcoming September elections in Germany would 
<br>also allow the new German government to be more open to EU 
<br>enlargement to include the Balkan countries.  Paris wants the 
<br>door to enlargement to remain open, even if the accession 
<br>process takes time. 
<br> 
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br>CONCERNS ABOUT TURKEY 
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (C) Levitte informed A/S Gordon that there had been no 
<br>change in the French position advocating a "privileged 
<br>partnership" between the European Union and Turkey, in lieu 
<br>of EU membership.  However, he emphasized that France was not 
<br>preventing accession negotiations from progressing on all the 
<br>EU chapters that do not pre-suppose membership.  There remain 
<br>plenty of chapters of the acquis to open, so if progress is 
<br>not being made, the fault lies with Turkish intransigence on 
<br>Cyprus.  Unfortunately, Ankara is not completing the required 
<br>necessary reforms and progress has stalled.  Levitte 
<br>anticipated a negative report this fall on Turkey's failure 
<br>to fulfill the Ankara Protocol.  A/S Gordon said that Turkey 
<br>was caught in a vicious cycle and it is not completing 
<br>necessary reforms because the Turks do not believe that their 
<br>EU candidacy will be allowed to progress, and at the same 
<br>time, their negotiations are not progressing because they 
<br>aren't completing the required reforms.  He noted that in the 
<br>latest German Marshall Fund polls in Turkey, fewer that 30% 
<br>of the Turkish public believes they will succeed in getting 
<br>EU membership. 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (C) Levitte agreed, but noted that Paris hopes that it 
<br>will be the Turks themselves who realize that their role is 
<br>best played as a bridge between the two worlds of Europe and 
<br>Asia, rather than anchored in Europe itself.  He stated that 
<br>Turkey is in a difficult position as it wants to enter the EU 
<br>but has refused to accept one of the other EU member states. 
<br>Levitte predicted that a worse case scenario would be if 
<br>Turkey finally manages to complete the acquis and end 
<br>negotiations and a public referendum is held in France which 
<br>is finally opposed to their membership.  Despite all of these 
<br>problems, Levitte claimed that President Sarkozy is a friend 
<br>of Turkey and has visited the country at least 10 times in 
<br>his life. 
<br> 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br>RUSSIA AND GEORGIA 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (C)  A/S Gordon described the challenges and frustrations 
<br>of the U.S.- Russia relationship, which is based on finding 
<br>areas where we can work together on our common interest.  He 
<br>noted progress at the July summit meeting on such issues as 
<br>START talks and transfer of lethal material through Russia to 
<br>Afghanistan.  Galharague described Russia as a state with the 
<br>trappings of democracy but without any mechanisms for the 
<br>public to influence government decision-making.  "The root of 
<br>the problem is the regime," he said.  Presidential advisor 
<br>Loras added Russian leaders lacked sufficient, long-range 
<br>vision for their country and instead, focused on a six-month 
<br>time horizon and their business interests.  Galharague 
<br> 
<br>PARIS 00001254  003 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>described the French strategy as finding a balance between 
<br>treating Russia as if it is too important or treating it like 
<br>an enemy. The French observed that some in Russia have 
<br>concluded their interests are served by keeping the west 
<br>"tied down in an Afghanistan quagmire" and by sustaining the 
<br>status quo in Iran.  He elaborated that a solution that 
<br>thwarts Iran's nuclear weapons ambitions and restores Iran as 
<br>a normal member of the international community could 
<br>undermine Russian regional and energy interests.  Loras noted 
<br>of late the Russians have been unhelpful on Iran.   Moreover, 
<br>they appear to have concluded they can pocket a projected 
<br>U.S. decision to scale back or abandon the Bush 
<br>administration's Missile Defense initiative without paying 
<br>any cost. 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (C) Looking ahead on the energy front, Loras predicted 
<br>that substantial Russian under-investment in energy 
<br>extraction infrastructure was such that Russia would not be 
<br>able to meet European demand in four or five years.  He 
<br>observed this created an opportunity for Russia to have even 
<br>more leverage over a Europe that has not prepared to 
<br>diversify its energy supplies. In response to a question on 
<br>Russia's decision to suspend negotiations on World Trade 
<br>Organization membership in favor of a customs union with 
<br>Kazakhstan and Belarus,  A/S Gordon replied the U.S. would 
<br>continue a policy review on Missile Defense to take the right 
<br>decision based on the merits.   On Russian actions regarding 
<br>the WTO, he said that Moscow's decision was likely supported 
<br>by Russians whose interests were not advanced by opening 
<br>markets.  Galharague observed that failure to advance WTO 
<br>membership for Russia had negative implications for 
<br>EU-Russian trade relations as progress in this EU effort 
<br>pre-supposed progress on Russian accession to the WTO. Loras 
<br>reported the coming year will involve substantial 
<br>Franco-Russian interactions.  This engagement would include a 
<br>visit by French Prime Minister Fillon to Russia in September, 
<br>a visit to France by Putin in November, a state visit to 
<br>France by Medvedev in March, and a Sarkozy visit to Russia in 
<br>2010 on the margins of the St. Petersburg forum.  These 
<br>visits would occur under the auspices of reciprocal "Year of 
<br>France" events in Russia and "Year of Russia" events in 
<br>France. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (C) Levitte and A/S Gordon discussed the "dangerous" 
<br>precedent of ships being intercepted in Georgian waters. 
<br>Sarkozy Advisor Damien Loras noted that President Saakashvili 
<br>has a French advisor who has informed Paris that Georgian 
<br>ships have orders to respond if fired upon.  This can 
<br>escalate and the French message has been to emphasize that 
<br>Georgia must not respond to provocation, as that would only 
<br>play into Russia's hands.  Levitte stressed the importance of 
<br>maintaining the Geneva process, while noting that it may take 
<br>a generation before the Russian public will be able to accept 
<br>their loss of influence, from Poland and the Baltics to 
<br>Ukraine and Georgia.  Unfortunately, the Russian tendency is 
<br>to view "good neighbors" as totally submissive subordinates. 
<br>On the other hand, Paris is closely watching Medvedev, who is 
<br>more frequently taking public stances in opposition to Putin. 
<br> Medvedev is more open to the occidental powers and more open 
<br>to modernization and rule of law issues that Russia must 
<br>face.  A/S Gordon observed that President Obama had spent a 
<br>good deal of time with Medvedev on his trip to Russia, and 
<br>had specifically targeted Russian youth in his public 
<br>outreach event.  In his meeting with Galharague and others, 
<br>A/S Gordon noted that the U.S. pursues a policy to support 
<br>Georgia in the face of Russian pressure without encouraging 
<br>President Saakashvili to act in ways that are unhelpful. 
<br> 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br>IRAN: NEXT STEPS 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶11.  (S/NF)  Levitte noted that the Iranian response to the 
<br>overture of President Obama and the West was "a farce," 
<br>although Russia had received it as a real initiative.  The 
<br>current Iranian regime is effectively a fascist state and the 
<br>time has come to decide on next steps.  Levitte stated that 
<br>this is why Paris is advocating a meeting of the EU3 PLUS 3 
<br>on the margins of the Pittsburgh G20 meeting.  The French 
<br>hope to approve a two-paragraph statement laying out next 
<br>steps on negotiations or sanctions.  He noted that German 
<br>Chancellor Angela Merkel shares the view of the French 
<br>President and is willing to be firm on sanctions, but that FM 
<br>Steinmeier was more cautious.  The Iranian regime must 
<br>understand that it will be more threatened by economic harm 
<br>and the attendant social unrest than it would be by 
<br>negotiating with the West.  Unfortunately, the P-3 cannot 
<br>remain passive until Russia and China finally lose patience; 
<br> 
<br>PARIS 00001254  004 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>this is why a high-level political meeting is important to 
<br>advance this discussion (and Levitte cited President 
<br>Sarkozy's frank and direct style, saying that he would 
<br>pinpoint Medvedev to explain his position).  Levitte said 
<br>that he informed the Chinese FM that if they delay until a 
<br>possible Israeli raid, then the world will have to deal with 
<br>a catastrophic energy crisis as well.  At the same time, the 
<br>debate over stopping the flow of gasoline into Iran will be 
<br>very sensitive and would have to take into account which 
<br>countries would be only too willing to step in and replace 
<br>European companies.  Levitte informed us that they would like 
<br>President Sarkozy to talk to President Obama by telephone in 
<br>the coming days to discuss the G20 and Iran.  The French are 
<br>proposing two possible windows to schedule the call. 
<br> 
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br>NATO'S ENLARGEMENT AND STRATEGIC CONCEPT 
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶12.  (C) Levitte said that France was very pleased with the 
<br>selection of Madeleine Albright to chair the "Group of 12," 
<br>which will launch the process of reviewing NATO's Strategic 
<br>Concept.  Bruno Racine will be the French participant on the 
<br>panel, and Levitte stressed that there is already strong 
<br>agreement between France and the United States on the basis 
<br>of exchanges that he has had with NSA General Jim Jones. 
<br>Levitte noted that Paris agreed with Jones on suppressing the 
<br>Membership Action Plan (MAP), which had become an obstacle 
<br>rather than an incentive.  A/S Gordon responded that we must 
<br>not change the process in a way that would be interpreted as 
<br>suggesting an end to NATO enlargement and eliminating MAP 
<br>might do that.  Levitte agreed and added that French 
<br>President Sarkozy was "convinced" that Ukraine would one day 
<br>be a member of NATO, but that there was no point in rushing 
<br>the process and antagonizing Russia, particularly if the 
<br>Ukrainian public was largely against membership.  The 
<br>Bucharest summit declaration was very clear that NATO has an 
<br>open door and Ukraine and Georgia have a vocation in NATO 
<br>(even if Georgia remains very unstable at the moment). 
<br>Levitte added that Paris was very pleased with the ceremony 
<br>on September 9 transferring the Allied Command Transformation 
<br>(ACT) to French General Stephane Abrial. 
<br> 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>VENEZUELA 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶13.  (C) Levitte observed that Venezuelan President Hugo 
<br>Chavez is "crazy" and said that even Brazil wasn't able to 
<br>support him anymore.  Unfortunately, Chavez is taking one of 
<br>the richest countries in Latin America and turning it into 
<br>another Zimbabwe. 
<br> 
<br>¶14.  (U) Assistant Secretary Gordon has cleared this message.
