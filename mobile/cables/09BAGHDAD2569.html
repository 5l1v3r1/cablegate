<br>
<br>SUBJ: Prime Minister Accuses Iran of Trying to Destabilize 
<br>Iraq 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) In a September 22 meeting, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri 
<br>al-Maliki told the Ambassador that Iran is intervening 
<br>increasingly boldly in the Iraqi political process in a bid 
<br>to "control the COR" (the Council of Representatives, the 
<br>Iraqi Parliament). Iran has not discarded use of military 
<br>means to attain its objectives, Maliki said, but for now it 
<br>is focusing on political means. If Iran does not succeed in 
<br>influencing the upcoming Iraqi national elections, Maliki 
<br>said, he expects to see them return to military actions. 
<br>Maliki said that the Iranian initiative was thwarted -- dealt 
<br>a "fatal blow" -- by Dawa's refusal to join the Shi,a 
<br>alliance being forged for the elections (the Iraqi National 
<br>Alliance). Iran, he said, is trying to rally the Shi'a to 
<br>counter the "Saudi project" to align the Sunni states. But 
<br>if Dawa had joined the Shi'a alliance, he said, that "could 
<br>have led to sectarian strife." 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) Maliki said that Iran is using the Saudi efforts as 
<br>pretext to continue its intervention in Iraq. On September 
<br>21, for example, the Saudis sponsored a meeting in Amman at 
<br>which at least ten senior Iraqi Sunnis attended, including 
<br>Rafi al-Issawi. While in Washington, Maliki said, he asked 
<br>POTUS to intervene with Saudi Arabia to ask them to stop 
<br>their efforts at rallying the Sunni, in part precisely to 
<br>avoid inflaming sectarianism and to deny Iran that pretext 
<br>for similarly seeking to rally the Shi,a. Maliki's concerns 
<br>in this regard have not abated, he said. He chose not to 
<br>press this issue again with VPOTUS during his September 18 
<br>visit to Baghdad because he felt he had expressed his 
<br>concerns once and it was not necessary to continue to raise 
<br>the same issue. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) Turning to the Mujahedin el Khalkh (MEK), the 
<br>Ambassador urged Maliki not to take any provocative actions 
<br>prior to the elections. Maliki took this point on board, but 
<br>replied by asking what outcome the USG sees, and how long 
<br>this situation can go on. Ambassador stressed that a.) the 
<br>situation "won't go on forever," b.) the USG has sent a 
<br>"stern message" to the MEK that they must deal directly with 
<br>the GOI, not the USG, and c.) the U.S. base near the MEK camp 
<br>will eventually be closing. The USG has urged the Europeans 
<br>to take a similar stance, and is seeking greater United 
<br>Nations involvement in treating the MEK as refugees. Maliki 
<br>replied that the GOI "has to do something" so that it can say 
<br>it has started the process. Otherwise, he said, this issue 
<br>will be used against him in the elections. In Maliki's view, 
<br>"whoever wants to return to their country can do so." The 
<br>rest, he said, should be relocated away from the Iranian 
<br>border, to protect them and Iraq from Iranian pressure. 
<br>Iran, Maliki said, at one time was even contemplating a 
<br>long-range missile strike on the camp, and even today is 
<br>considering filing a case against Iraq for "harboring a 
<br>terrorist organization." The GOI must try to relocate "at 
<br>least 1,000" members before the end of the year, Maliki said, 
<br>returning to his theme that the GOI must do something prior 
<br>to the elections. Ambassador emphasized that any attempt to 
<br>forcibly remove members could lead to bloodshed and crisis, 
<br>and again urged Maliki not to do so. Maliki said he felt 
<br>most members would willingly relocate. Only the leadership 
<br>of the group objects, and they are "criminals." 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) Comment: Maliki,s comments regarding Iranian 
<br>Q4. (S) Comment: Maliki,s comments regarding Iranian 
<br>involvement in internal Iraqi affairs are the strongest we 
<br>have heard. The Shi,a alliance INA is under considerable 
<br>pressure from the Iranians to persuade or even threaten 
<br>Maliki,s Dawa party to join the alliance, but on terms 
<br>unfavorable or unsatisfactory to either Dawa or Maliki. He 
<br>anticipates that if he pursues his non-sectarian State of Law 
<br>alliance, he will encounter not only stiff resistance from 
<br>the INA but also heavy and active opposition from the 
<br>Iranians. Regarding MEK, while it appears that the GOI will 
<br>not move immediately after Ramadan against the camp,s 
<br>residents, the eventual transfer operation will likely occur 
<br>before the end of the year. We will continue to advocate 
<br>patience, direct GOI-MEK negotiation for a peaceful transfer 
<br>and involvement of an international organization. End 
<br>Comment.
