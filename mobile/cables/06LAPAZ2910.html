<br>SUBJECT: VP, AMBASSADOR DISCUSS WAYS TO IMPROVE BILATERAL 
<br>TIES 
<br>
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Philip S. Goldberg for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d 
<br>). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: In their first meeting since the Ambassador 
<br>presented his credentials October 13, the Ambassador and Vice 
<br>President Alvaro Garcia Linera engaged in a cordial exchange 
<br>October 26 on U.S. assistance, extension of ATPDEA benefits, 
<br>Morales' anti-American discourse, military relations and 
<br>counternarcotics. The vice president opened the meeting 
<br>warmly, saying that his recent visit to a USAID fair had 
<br>provided him with a valuable education about U.S. assistance 
<br>in Bolivia. With respect to President Bush's announcement in 
<br>support of an ATPDEA extension for the region, the vice 
<br>president said the GOB is "very happy and grateful" for this 
<br>"friendly sign" from the United States. The Ambassador told 
<br>Garcia Linera that the best way forward for the GOB would be 
<br>to not only lower, but to improve, its public discourse 
<br>toward the United States. The Ambassador also cautioned 
<br>Garcia Linera that Bolivia's relationships with other 
<br>countries have consequences. The vice president said he 
<br>hoped the Ambassador would rely on him as an "instant 
<br>messenger" for any communications with the GOB in order to 
<br>avoid missteps in the relationship. On mil-mil relations, 
<br>Garcia Linera said he hoped to remove the F-10 
<br>counterterrorism matter and the MANPADS issue from the 
<br>bilateral agenda, although he said the missiles transfer 
<br>would continue to be an internal issue. On counternarcotics, 
<br>the Ambassador said that voluntary eradication is ideal, but 
<br>said that the GOB would have to show quick results. 
<br>Following the meeting, the Ambassador and the vice president 
<br>held a joint press conference, the first of its kind since 
<br>Morales took office in January. Despite the recent ups and 
<br>downs in the bilateral relationship, Garcia Linera appeared 
<br>to be putting on his best face for the Ambassador. End 
<br>summary. 
<br>
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br>U.S. ASSISTANCE: A PLEASANT SURPRISE 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) The vice president opened the meeting warmly, saying 
<br>that while he had been familiar with the amount of U.S. 
<br>assistance, his visit to a recent USAID fair had provided him 
<br>with a valuable education about its "characteristics." 
<br>Garcia Linera was particularly impressed with USAID's 
<br>microenterprise and agricultural assistance, which he said 
<br>directly help many poor Bolivians. Garcia Linera also noted 
<br>the Ambassador's October 25 book and equipment donations in 
<br>the Altiplano. The Ambassador said he hopes to continue 
<br>traveling in order to demonstrate our desire to assist 
<br>Bolivians with their development efforts, as well as to 
<br>improve Bolivians' understanding of the United States. He 
<br>expressed concern that many Bolivians' image of the United 
<br>States is outdated, and that we are in fact a very dynamic 
<br>country that understands well the struggle to overcome 
<br>social, political and economic exclusion. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
<br>U.S. EXECUTIVE BRANCH SUPPORT FOR ATPDEA EXTENSION 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) With respect to President Bush's announcement in 
<br>support of an ATPDEA extension for the region, the vice 
<br>president said the GOB is "very happy and grateful" for this 
<br>"friendly sign" from the United States. The Ambassador 
<br>complimented the vice president's October 25 comments on 
<br>ATPDEA, saying that he was prudent to caution the Bolivian 
<br>people that the matter will be decided by the U.S. Congress. 
<br>The Ambassador told the vice president that President Bush's 
<br>support is an example of our desire to improve relations with 
<br>Bolivia. Garcia Linera stressed that in the absence of free 
<br>trade negotiations, ATPDEA is of critical importance to 
<br>Bolivia. The vice president acknowledged former Ambassador 
<br>
<br>LA PAZ 00002910 002 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>Greenlee's advice to the GOB on ATPDEA, saying that he hoped 
<br>that the Ambassador would continue in the same vein. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br>REINFORCING THE MESSAGE: PLEASE LOWER THE TONE 
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) The Ambassador told Garcia Linera that the best way 
<br>forward for the GOB would be to not only lower, but to 
<br>improve, its public discourse toward the United States. He 
<br>cautioned that President Morales' anti-American remarks may 
<br>damage Bolivia's chances for an ATPDEA extension. The 
<br>Ambassador explained that before his arrival at post, he 
<br>participated in counternarcotics certification conversations, 
<br>in which he said there were serious questions about 
<br>recertifying Bolivia. If we hadn't certified, the Ambassador 
<br>said, we wouldn't be talking about an ATPDEA extension now. 
<br>The Ambassador told the vice president that he offered the 
<br>president, the minister of the presidency and the foreign 
<br>minister the same counsel-- that the GOB needs to lower its 
<br>tone. He said the USG cannot compartmentalize its foreign 
<br>policy, but looks at the overall relationship. The 
<br>Ambassador said that by accusing the USG and the Embassy of 
<br>conspiracy and assassination attempts, the GOB had fallen 
<br>well below the accepted norms of diplomatic and political 
<br>discourse. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Garcia Linera attempted to defend Morales' 
<br>anti-American rhetoric, saying that the president's history 
<br>with the United States was one of "distance and conflict." 
<br>He said the GOB wants to turn the page but that "the history 
<br>is still there," although "each time less." The vice 
<br>president said the GOB wants to close the era of mistrust 
<br>definitively, saying that Morales' trip to the United States 
<br>for the United Nations General Assembly was a big step 
<br>forward in this regard. He said the trip enabled Morales to 
<br>see the "human" side of our country, and that it was 
<br>important for Morales to see the United States as an open, 
<br>pluralistic society. He said the president was "excited" 
<br>when he returned, energized by the personal contact with 
<br>Americans he had had in the United States. The vice 
<br>president said he "celebrated" Morales' trip and described 
<br>the bilateral relationship following it as "closer, 
<br>friendlier." Garcia Linera said he hopes that Morales will 
<br>visit the United States again soon. The visit aside, Garcia 
<br>Linera said he could not "guarantee" that Morales would not 
<br>suffer a rhetorical relapse, but promised to try. He said 
<br>that he had asked Ambassador Greenlee for a "good dose of 
<br>patience" and asked Ambassador Goldberg for the same as a 
<br>"very personal request." Garcia Linera said the GOB is "not 
<br>looking for confrontation or tension." He said that once in 
<br>a while, "fissures will open, things surface, but we want to 
<br>expand and improve relations." 
<br>
<br>------------------------------ 
<br>CHOOSE YOUR FRIENDS CAREFULLY 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Along the same lines, the Ambassador cautioned Garcia 
<br>Linera that Bolivia's relationship with other countries may 
<br>have consequences. He said Bolivia's relations are Bolivia's 
<br>business, but that the GOB should be aware that they can 
<br>impact its relations with other countries, including the 
<br>United States. The Ambassador offered the example of a 
<br>recent anti-American speech by the Venezuelan ambassador, 
<br>with Morales at his side. The Ambassador added that no one in 
<br>the diplomatic corps seems to have met the Venezuelan 
<br>ambassador, a signal that raises questions about the 
<br>Venezuelan's activities here. Garcia Linera said he 
<br>understood and said "we don't need" those consequences. 
<br>Likewise, the Ambassador suggested that the GOB be careful 
<br>not to interfere in the democratic processes of neighboring 
<br>countries, citing a press report that Morales and Ecuador's 
<br>
<br>LA PAZ 00002910 003 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>"legitimate president" Rafael Correa would speak at an 
<br>October 26 event supporting Bolivia's "revolution" (septel). 
<br>The Ambassador said respect for Ecuador's democratic process 
<br>could only help Bolivia's international image. Garcia Linera 
<br>appeared to take the Ambassador's comment on board, 
<br>responding that the GOB was not funding the conference. 
<br>
<br>------------------- 
<br>YOU CAN TALK TO ME 
<br>------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) The vice president said he hoped the Ambassador would 
<br>rely on him as an "instant messenger" for any communications 
<br>with the GOB in order to avoid missteps in the relationship. 
<br>Garcia Linera said, "Don't doubt me as a channel for 
<br>anything." He encouraged the Ambassador to pass him 
<br>criticisms and observations, and to call him at any hour or 
<br>to ask for a meeting with him or the president on short 
<br>notice. Garcia Linera referred to a recent GOB experience 
<br>with bad intelligence (presumably on the subject of U.S. 
<br>students in Bolivia whom the GOB alleged were undercover U.S. 
<br>military operatives), saying that if a similar situation 
<br>presents itself, the president would like to call the 
<br>Ambassador to confirm the information. Garcia Linera 
<br>lamented that at the time of that incident, the GOB "didn't 
<br>have a bridge" to the Embassy, leading the president to keep 
<br>the information to himself and then to speak about it 
<br>publicly. Garcia Linera admitted that was "their mistake" and 
<br>that they have to work against susceptibility to certain 
<br>types of information. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) The Ambassador thanked the vice president for his 
<br>offer and agreed to contact him with any questions or 
<br>concerns. He also encouraged Garcia Linera to call him, 
<br>particularly before publicly accusing the USG of any 
<br>wrongdoing. The Ambassador stressed that the USG has not 
<br>reacted publicly to Morales' accusations because of our 
<br>desire to improve relations. In turn, Garcia Linera said he 
<br>would welcome the Ambassador's counsel on how the GOB could 
<br>improve the bilateral relationship. The vice president 
<br>admitted the GOB had been skeptical about former Ambassador 
<br>Greenlee's advice in this regard--and had even debated about 
<br>whether Greenlee's advice was good. Garcia Linera said in 
<br>the end, they had accepted the Embassy's advice in good faith 
<br>and had been pleasantly surprised. 
<br>
<br>------------------------------------------- 
<br>MILITARY RELATIONS: VP WANTS TO STRENGTHEN 
<br>------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) In response to the Ambassador's stated desire to 
<br>improve mil-mil relations (despite Article 98 restrictions), 
<br>Garcia Linera said he hoped to remove the F-10 
<br>counterterrorism matter and the MANPADS issue from the 
<br>bilateral agenda, although he said the missiles transfer 
<br>would continue to be an internal issue. Garcia Linera said 
<br>Bolivian forces are no longer using the F-10 arms and that 
<br>plans are underway to transfer them to permit U.S access. 
<br>The Ambassador said he was optimistic about resolving that 
<br>issue and hoped that we could do the same with the missiles 
<br>transfer, despite the political complexities of that issue. 
<br>Garcia Linera said that while he understands the U.S. 
<br>position, the pending "internal investigation" of President 
<br>Rodriguez and other GOB officials would not be resolved 
<br>quickly. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) The Ambassador also said that we would like to do 
<br>more in the area of military education and exchanges. Garcia 
<br>Linera welcomed the overture, adding that he would like to 
<br>take up the full range of military cooperation prohibited by 
<br>Article 98 later. The Ambassador gently reminded Garcia 
<br>Linera that the GOB should ratify the agreement so they could 
<br>give him access. Finally, Garcia Linera expressed great 
<br>
<br>LA PAZ 00002910 004 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>interest in the milgroup's New Horizons exercise planned for 
<br>2007, as well as other civil works. The Ambassador explained 
<br>that we are asking the GOB to sign a new Status of Forces 
<br>Agreement to make such projects possible, and that we have 
<br>already raised the subject with the ministries of defense, 
<br>presidency and foreign relations. 
<br>
<br>------------------------------------------- 
<br>COUNTERNARCOTICS: AN INITIAL CONVERSATION 
<br>------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) On counternarcotics, the Ambassador said of course 
<br>the USG would like to see the GOB's voluntary eradication 
<br>program work, but said the GOB would have to show quick 
<br>results. The Ambassador said that while he realized coca is 
<br>a sensitive topic domestically, it is in both countries' 
<br>interest to work together to fight drug trafficking. He told 
<br>Garcia Linera that it would be impossible for the USG to 
<br>support the GOB's coca ideology (e.g. industrialization and 
<br>legalization), suggesting instead that the two governments 
<br>focus on their common interest in stopping the flow of drugs. 
<br>He also told the vice president that President Morales' 
<br>ill-informed statements on U.S. drug use were not helpful. 
<br>The Ambassador told Garcia Linera that the United States has 
<br>worked hard to lower drug consumption, but that consumption 
<br>is up in Europe and is a growing problem in Brazil and 
<br>Bolivia. Garcia Linera described eradication as 
<br>"complicated," but noted that the Morales government is 
<br>eradicating in many new areas. Garcia Linera made a subtle 
<br>pitch for increased U.S. counternarcotics assistance, saying 
<br>the GOB needs additional eradicators. If not, he said, we 
<br>will see an increase in narcotrafficking. The Ambassador 
<br>suggested they discuss counternarcotics strategies in depth 
<br>soon, and noted that the October 28 arrival of INL Deputy 
<br>Assistant Secretary Christy McCampbell would present an 
<br>immediate opportunity for further dialogue. 
<br>
<br>----------------------- 
<br>A UNITED PUBLIC FRONT 
<br>----------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Following the meeting, the Ambassador and the vice 
<br>president held a joint press conference at the Ambassador's 
<br>urging, the first of its kind since Morales took office in 
<br>January. Like the meeting, the tone of the press conference 
<br>was warm. The vice president publicly thanked the Ambassador 
<br>for his visit, describing it as "cordial." Garcia Linera 
<br>said he and the Ambassador had discussed "steps forward" on 
<br>many issues of mutual interest, and cited the GOB's will and 
<br>his own personal commitment to "expand and improve" relations 
<br>with the United States, particularly in order to promote 
<br>democracy and fight poverty and drug trafficking. 
<br>
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>COMMENT: STARTING A NEW CHAPTER 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Despite the recent ups and downs in the bilateral 
<br>relationship, Garcia Linera appeared to be putting on his 
<br>best face for the Ambassador. During the hour-long meeting, 
<br>the two talked about the president's birthday (October 26), 
<br>which a crowd of supporters commemorated with fireworks 
<br>(causing an occasional noisy interruption to the otherwise 
<br>smooth conversation) and a toy donation ceremony for Bolivian 
<br>children. (Note: Garcia Linera said the president was 
<br>delighted to give the children toys because he had played 
<br>with sheep bones as a child in eocnomically-depressed Oruro. 
<br>End note). Garcia Linera seemed relaxed and pleased to start 
<br>anew with the USG, even responding to the Ambassador's 
<br>invitation to use first names by telling the Ambassador to 
<br>"call me Alvaro." Garcia Linera said he had been very 
<br>attentive to Ambassador Goldberg's words and gestures since 
<br>he arrived, implying his approval of his new interlocutor. 
<br>
<br>LA PAZ 00002910 005 OF 005
