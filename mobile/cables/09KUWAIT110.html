<br>
<br>REF: KUWAIT 0095
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) SUMMARY:  During a February 3 meeting in their
<br>ongoing dialog on US-Kuwait CT cooperation, Kuwaiti Minister
<br>of Interior Shaykh Jaber al-Khalid Al Sabah discussed with
<br>Ambassador US and Kuwaiti efforts to locate and apprehend
<br>terror financiers (including Mohammed Sultan Ibrahim Sultan
<br>Al-Ali, aka Jawad/Abu Umar), applauded improved liaison
<br>information exchange, expressed skepticism Kuwait would ever
<br>develop a rehabilitation center for former GTMO detainees and
<br>other extremists supporting jihad, and suggested the US
<br>should release current GTMO detainees back into Afghanistan,
<br>where they could be killed in combat.  He sardonically
<br>questioned why US NAVCENT forces had gone to the trouble of
<br>rescuing foundering Iranian hashish smugglers two weeks
<br>earlier, saying "God meant to punish them with death and you
<br>saved them.  Why?"  Characterizing the previous Saturday's
<br>provincial elections as a "huge success," Shaykh Jaber
<br>expressed his belief that President Obama and the US had the
<br>tools necessary to successfully confront all challenges.  END
<br>SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) Ambassador called on Shaykh Jaber February 3 to
<br>review progress on our CT liaison relationship and to seek
<br>the Interior Minister's support for operational concepts
<br>aimed at intercepting individuals involved in the
<br>exploitation of traditional smuggling routes in the northern
<br>Gulf to move would-be jihadists and their
<br>financier/facilitators between Kuwait and Iran, Pakistan and
<br>Afghanistan.  Shaykh Jaber began the meeting by applauding
<br>the "huge success" of the provincial elections in Iraq and
<br>expressing his confidence in the ability of President Obama
<br>and the "super power" US to address current challenges.
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) Ambassador noted she'd met recently with VADM
<br>McCraven, now JSOC commander for this region, and that they'd
<br>discussed alternative approaches to staunching the flows of
<br>terror financing, given the constraints of Kuwait's current
<br>legal and political systems.  Offering his support for these
<br>approaches ) and underscoring that he was as concerned about
<br>terrorist influences from Saudi Arabia as from Iran, given
<br>the loose border controls -- the Minister expressed his
<br>understanding of what he characterized (fairly) as improved
<br>information exchange between our services, while
<br>acknowledging the ongoing deficiencies in Kuwait's legal
<br>system that stymie effective prosecution and restraint of
<br>these individuals once captured.
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) Ambassador noted recent press reports that
<br>self-confessed jihadi recruiter and financier Mohammed
<br>al-Bathali had been released on a 500 dinar bond after being
<br>sentenced to three of a possible five years imprisonment for
<br>"inciting jihad against a friendly state."  (Reftel)  At the
<br>same time, Kuwait's Ambassador to the US, Shaykh Salem Al
<br>Sabah, had approached S/WCI Ambassador Clint Williamson to
<br>inquire after the status of Kuwait's four remaining GTMO
<br>detainees.  Ambassador clarified that President Obama's
<br>announcement of our determination to close the detention
<br>center at Guantanamo did not mean we no longer had security
<br>concerns which would be factored into any release scenarios;
<br>the Kuwaiti detainees were nasty, unrepentant individuals and
<br>Kuwait's record had been tarnished by the example of former
<br>GTMO detainee al-Ajmi, who'd allegedly blown himself up in
<br>Mosul following his release to the Kuwaiti authorities.
<br>Ambassador asked the Interior Minister the status of the
<br>rehabilitation center Prime Minister Shaykh Nasser Mohammed
<br>Al Sabah had mentioned in his September 18th conversation
<br>with then-Secretary Rice in Washington.  Ambassador noted
<br>that we were aware of the stories of Saudis who'd gone
<br>through SAG rehabilitation centers only to re-emerge with Al
<br>Qaeda in Yemen; nonetheless, the GOK had to take steps to
<br>show its seriousness in changing and controlling the
<br>behaviors of extremists within its society.
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) Shaykh Jaber replied with an anecdote:  Following
<br>the 1990 invasion of Kuwait and Desert Storm, General
<br>Schwarzkopf had raised the issue of "rehabilitating" Kuwaitis
<br>who'd been exposed to the brutality of war so that they could
<br>re-integrate into society.  Shaykh (Ret,d General) Jaber had
<br>replied:  "But you are thinking of the Vietnam model, where
<br>young war veterans came home to empty apartments or anonymous
<br>urban environments.  That is not who we are.  We are a small,
<br>close-knit society and everyone knows each other.  No one
<br>will feel alienated: those who can heal will heal naturally
<br>with family; those who cannot heal in that environment will
<br>never heal."  Relating this to the current topic, Shaykh
<br>
<br>KUWAIT 00000110  002 OF 002
<br>
<br>Jaber told the Ambassador:  "You know better than I that we
<br>cannot deal with these people (i.e. the GTMO detainees).  I
<br>can't detain them.  If I take their passports, they will sue
<br>to get them back (Note:  as happened with Al-Ajmi.  End
<br>note.)  I can talk to you into next week about building a
<br>rehabilitation center, but it won't happen.  We are not Saudi
<br>Arabia; we cannot isolate these people in desert camps or
<br>somewhere on an island.  We cannot compel them to stay.  If
<br>they are rotten, they are rotten and the best thing to do is
<br>get rid of them.  You picked them up in Afghanistan; you
<br>should drop them off in Afghanistan, in the middle of the war
<br>zone."
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) Ambassador then raised with the Minister developing
<br>an SOP for dealing with incidents such as the recent rescue
<br>by US NAVCENT forces in the northern Gulf of seven Iranian
<br>smugglers whose boat was foundering while engaged in
<br>smuggling hashish.  In the event, the Omanis had agreed to
<br>repatriate the Iranians but we nonetheless needed to think
<br>about dealing with similar episodes in future in expeditious
<br>fashion.  The initial response of the Kuwaiti Coast Guard had
<br>been to refer the matter to the Minister of Interior, via the
<br>Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  The Ambassador noted our
<br>supposition that the Kuwaiti Coast Guard must have had
<br>similar experiences with Iranian smugglers who needed
<br>repatriation to Iran.  Smiling broadly, the Interior Minister
<br>deflected the question, saying "God wished to punish them for
<br>smuggling drugs by drowning them, and then you saved them.
<br>So they're your problem!  You should have let them drown."
<br>In any case, he added, the Kuwaitis generally sent the
<br>Iranians back to Iran in their own boats so there had not
<br>been a question of physically handing them over.
<br>
<br>¶7. (S/NF) In closing, Ambassador noted that the Minister had
<br>created the position of Special Advisor to Shaykh Jaber for
<br>Kuwait Security Services (our GRPO liaison counterpart) and
<br>assigned Shaykh Salman Sabah al-Salem al-Humoud Al Sabah to
<br>that role.  Ambassador asked whether the Minister believed
<br>there was any appropriate liaison relationship between the
<br>Embassy and Shaykh Salman, to which the Minister replied in
<br>the negative.  Finally, the Ambassador invited the Minister
<br>to join her in attending the US Ambassador's reception
<br>February 24 at the IDEX event in Abu Dhabi, as part of our
<br>efforts to boost the relationship.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) COMMENT:  The Minister was as frank and pessimistic as
<br>ever when it came to the subject of apprehending and
<br>detaining terror financiers and facilitators under Kuwait's
<br>current legal and political framework.  Ongoing tensions
<br>between parliament and the PM and his cabinet make any
<br>changes highly unlikely any time soon.  The remaining GTMO
<br>detainees remain a particularly thorny issue for the
<br>leadership here, who privately recognize the downsides of
<br>taking custody and readily acknowledge their inability to
<br>manage them but who remain under strong domestic political
<br>pressure to "bring their boys home."  Telling was the fact
<br>that press accounts of the Ambassador's February 3 meeting
<br>with the Minister (which was one-on-one with a notetaker) and
<br>her meeting two days earlier with the MFA U/S focused solely
<br>on the GTMO issue, although it was discussed only marginally.
<br>END COMMENT.
