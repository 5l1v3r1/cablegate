<br> 
<br>¶1. (U) This is an action request.  Embassy Berlin, please see 
<br>paragraph 4. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S) Background and Objective:  We want to advise German 
<br>officials of information indicating that as of June 2009, two 
<br>Iranian intermediary firms offered test equipment manufactured 
<br>by the German firms Rohde & Schwarz and Hottinger Baldwin 
<br>Messtechnik (HBM) to Iran's primary developer of liquid-fueled 
<br>ballistic missiles, the Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group 
<br>(SHIG). 
<br>While this equipment is not controlled by the Missile 
<br>Technology Control Regime (MTCR), it could be used in 
<br>ballistic missile testing applications.  Moreover, SHIG made 
<br>specific requests for items manufactured by Rohde & Schwarz 
<br>and HBM, and goods produced by the two firms were the targets 
<br>of previous, long-running procurement efforts by SHIG and the 
<br>Iranian procurement network Farazeh Equipment Distributor 
<br>Company (FEDCO, which may have been acting on behalf of SHIG) 
<br>(Refs).  In both cases, German officials investigated the 
<br>information we provided and sensitized the firms to their 
<br>concerns.  (Note: In the HBM case, the company reported that 
<br>it did receive a request from Evertop Services (a FEDCO 
<br>affiliate), but that the request was rejected.  End note.)  We 
<br>want to share this new information with German officials and 
<br>encourage them to continue their efforts to prevent SHIG or 
<br>other Iranian entities of proliferation concern from procuring 
<br>sensitive items from Rohde & Schwarz and HBM. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  Action Request: Request Embassy Berlin approach 
<br>appropriate host government officials to deliver talking 
<br>points/non-paper in paragraph 4 below and report response. 
<br>Talking points also may be provided as a non-paper. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (S) Begin talking points/non-paper: 
<br> 
<br>(SECRET//REL GERMANY) 
<br> 
<br>-- We would like to alert you to information of proliferation 
<br>concern and request your assistance in investigating this 
<br>activity. 
<br> 
<br>-- Between 2007 and 2009, we discussed with you on numerous 
<br>occasions information indicating that Iranian entities of 
<br>proliferation concern were seeking equipment manufactured by 
<br>the German firms Rohde & Schwarz and Hottinger Baldwin 
<br>Messtechnik (HBM). 
<br> 
<br>-- Specifically, we advised you that the Shahid Hemmat 
<br>Industrial Group (SHIG, Iran's primary developer of liquid 
<br>fueled ballistic missiles) and entities affiliated with the 
<br>Farazeh Equipment Distributor Company (FEDCO) were engaged in 
<br>efforts to procure Rohde & Schwarz and HBM equipment. 
<br> 
<br>-- We were pleased to subsequently hear that German officials 
<br>had sensitized representatives of both firms to proliferation 
<br>concerns related to SHIG and FEDCO, and that HBM had rejected 
<br>a request from Evertop Services, an entity affiliated with 
<br>FEDCO. 
<br> 
<br>-- We now want to share with you related information 
<br>indicating that as of June 2009, SHIG was seeking test 
<br>equipment via Iranian intermediaries from both Rohde & Schwarz 
<br>and HBM. 
<br> 
<br>-- Specifically, we understand that the Tehran-based Heydari 
<br>Ofogh Sanat Anvar Company offered SHIG an ESIB model 
<br>electromagnetic interference test receiver and spectrum 
<br>analyzer manufactured by Rohde & Schwarz. 
<br> 
<br>-- We also understand that the Iranian company Hamim 
<br>Commercial offered SHIG pressure transducers and other 
<br>equipment produced by HBM. 
<br> 
<br>-- While this equipment is not controlled by the Missile 
<br>Technology Control Regime (MTCR), it could be used in 
<br>ballistic missile testing applications. 
<br> 
<br>-- We do not know if the Iranian intermediaries are already in 
<br>possession of the Rohde & Schwarz and HBM equipment, but 
<br>wanted to make you aware of the fact that Iran's missile 
<br>program made specific requests for items manufactured by these 
<br>German firms. 
<br> 
<br>-- We also want to reiterate that SHIG often conducts its 
<br>business through front companies and middlemen posing as end 
<br>users. 
<br> 
<br>-- Given SHIG's interest in this equipment and the previous 
<br>Iranian efforts to acquire Rohde & Schwarz and HBM equipment, 
<br>we wanted to share this latest information with you, and urge 
<br>you to continue your work to prevent these firms from acting, 
<br>even unwittingly, as suppliers to SHIG and other Iranian 
<br>entities of proliferation concern. 
<br> 
<br>-- We look forward to continuing our excellent cooperation on 
<br>nonproliferation matters and to hearing of any updates related 
<br>to this case.
