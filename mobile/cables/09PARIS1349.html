<br>SUBJECT: RWANDA: FRENCH JUDGE ENDS QUESTIONING OF ROSE 
<br>KABUYE 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Andrew Young, Political Counselor, 1.4 (b/d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: The French judge investigating events 
<br>concerning the 1994 Rwandan genocide has dismissed the first 
<br>Rwandan official questioned in the case. Rose Kabuye was 
<br>granted freedom of movement when the judge on September 25 
<br>lifted the international arrest warrant that was used to 
<br>compel her testimony. She has reportedly agreed to cooperate 
<br>with the investigation and may be subject to recall by the 
<br>judge. In an effort to determine if there is a case to 
<br>pursue, the judge in principle should interview the other 
<br>eight Rwandans subject to the original arrest warrant, 
<br>although this may take place in Rwanda. One MFA contact 
<br>views this development as a positive step towards resolving 
<br>the case and for improving broken French-Rwandan relations, 
<br>although resolving the cases involving the other eight is 
<br>likely to take time. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Charlotte Montel (AF-advisor in FM Kouchner's 
<br>cabinet) on September 30 provided an update in the Rose 
<br>Kabuye case, calling recent developments an important step in 
<br>the complex legal matter involving nine senior Rwandans, 
<br>which arose when then-terrorism judge Bruguiere in November 
<br>2006 issued his report on the events of 1994 that led to the 
<br>Rwandan genocide. Bruguiere's report contained warrants 
<br>against the nine and also recommended prosecution of Rwanda's 
<br>President Kagame for their alleged involvement in the 
<br>airplane shoot-down deaths of the Rwandan and Burundian 
<br>presidents that sparked the genocide. The legal case in 
<br>France was initiated in response to a complaint by the family 
<br>of the plane's French pilot. Bruguiere's report caused 
<br>Rwanda to sever relations with France, which remain severed. 
<br>Kabuye was arrested in Germany earlier this year pursuant to 
<br>the French warrant and has been questioned several times by 
<br>the investigating judge ("juge d'instruction"), who 
<br>nonetheless granted her liberal travel privileges provided 
<br>she comply with court orders, which she has done. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Montel said that on September 25, the investigating 
<br>judge informed Kabuye that he was finished questioning her 
<br>and that she was free to go, subject to the court's recall 
<br>for further testimony. Montel said that Kabuye agreed to 
<br>cooperate with the judge's investigation. Montel explained 
<br>that the warrants Bruguiere had issued were in effect arrest 
<br>warrants that would allow the investigating judge to question 
<br>the nine Rwandans pursuant to the judge's inquiry into the 
<br>1994 events. The warrants were not indictments but more in 
<br>the nature of subpoenas for detailed depositions. One reason 
<br>Rwanda reacted so strongly to the warrants was the fact that 
<br>the French investigating judge, if he had wanted, could have 
<br>gone to Rwanda and asked to interview the nine, rather than 
<br>making them the objects of international arrest warrants. 
<br>
<br>4 (C) Montel said that the September 25 ruling was an 
<br>important step because in releasing Kabuye (subject to her 
<br>cooperation and possible further testimony), the judge was 
<br>implicitly not moving towards indicting her. Also, in 
<br>response to the judge's ruling, Kabuye's lawyers offered 
<br>motions that further investigations be carried out in Rwanda, 
<br>which Montel thought likely. Montel cautioned, however, that 
<br>while this development in Kabuye's case was positive and 
<br>could ease France-Rwanda tensions, there were still eight 
<br>others whose cases needed resolution. Montel said that 
<br>Kabuye all along firmly denied that she had deliberately 
<br>allowed herself to be arrested, as a test case," as had been 
<br>reported by French daily Le Monde and other observers. 
<br>Montel conceded that several GOF officials had quietly 
<br>suggested to the Rwandans that one of the nine agree to be 
<br>arrested, which would allow the Rwandans to see what kind of 
<br>case the French had against the nine. She repeated, however, 
<br>that Kabuye consistently maintained that she never intended 
<br>to be arrested in Germany to test France's case against her 
<br>and her compatriots. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) COMMENT: Montel was notably upbeat in providing her 
<br>analysis of developments in the Kabuye case. We expect, 
<br>however, that the rest of the case, involving the other 
<br>eight, could require considerable time to resolve and that, 
<br>consequently, there will likely be no change in the status of 
<br>relations, unless Rwanda were to alter its position, which 
<br>does not appear likely. Montel did mention that the current 
<br>investigative judge could, on his own motion, annul 
<br>Bruguiere's warrants and carry out the investigation in 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00001349 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>another manner, which might perhaps be the best course in 
<br>terms of improving relations. However, given the vaunted 
<br>independence of the French judiciary, we are not confident 
<br>that the judge will choose that course of action. END 
<br>COMMENT.
