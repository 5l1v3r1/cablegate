<br>IRAN, PERCEPTION OF ISRAELI INFLUENCE IN WASHINGTON

<br>REF: TEL AVIV 605

<br>Classified By: DCM Luis G. Moreno, Reason 1.4 (b) (d) 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (S) Summary.  MFA Deputy Director General for the Middle 
<br>East Yacov Hadas provided PolCouns March 16 with an overview 
<br>of Israel's relations with several of the Gulf states.  Hadas 
<br>described Israel's relations with the Gulf as a function of 
<br>the Gulf Arabs' fear of Iran, but also as due to the Arabs' 
<br>belief in Israeli influence in Washington.  Fleshing out some 
<br>of the points he had made earlier to NEA Acting A/S Feltman 
<br>(reftel), Hadas described Qatar's shift toward the radical 
<br>camp in the region as a "game" linked to Qatari rivalry with 
<br>Saudi Arabia.  Hadas believes Qatar is feeling pressure from 
<br>Israel, Egypt and the Saudis, adding that he has been invited 
<br>to visit Doha for talks about how to resume normal 
<br>Qatari-Israeli ties.  Hadas noted that while the Omanis are 
<br>generally correct in their dealings with Israel, they appear 
<br>not to recognize the seriousness of the threat from Iran.  He 
<br>said that while the UAE is increasingly hostile to Iran, it 
<br>remains unclear how far they are willing to go in terms of 
<br>increasing financial pressures on Tehran.  Hadas said the 
<br>Gulf Arabs feel that the U.S. does not listen to them and 
<br>therefore sometimes try to pass messages through Israel. 
<br>While he agreed that progress on the Palestinian track would 
<br>make it easier for the Gulf states to be open about their 
<br>ties to Israel, he cautioned that the Gulf states use the 
<br>peace process as an "excuse not to take action" against Iran 
<br>or in support of the PA.  End Summary. 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (C) PolCouns called on Deputy Director General for the 
<br>Middle East Yacov Hadas March 16 to follow up on Hadas' March 
<br>4 discussion with Acting A/S Feltman of Israeli-Gulf 
<br>relations.  Beginning with Qatar, Hadas said there were signs 
<br>that various pressures on the Qataris were starting to have 
<br>an effect.  Hadas noted that Qatar could only get its 
<br>humanitarian relief supplies into Gaza through Israel. 
<br>Qatari diplomats assigned to their Gaza consulate also had to 
<br>cross through Israel since Egypt would not allow them to 
<br>enter Gaza from Rafah.  For now, the Israelis are not 
<br>allowing either Qatari assistance or personnel to cross into 
<br>Gaza.  Hadas noted that he had been invited to visit Doha to 
<br>discuss reopening the Israeli trade office, which he saw as a 
<br>positive sign.  He added that the Qataris needed to 
<br>understand that they could not expect to restore cooperative 
<br>relations with Israel without agreeing to reopen the trade 
<br>office. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (S) While Hadas was critical of the Qataris' treatment of 
<br>Israel since the Gaza operation, he stressed that he thought 
<br>Qatar's policies were not a matter of a shift in ideology 
<br>toward the radical camp, but linked to their rivalry with the 
<br>Saudis and, by extension, with Egypt.  In private settings, 
<br>Hadas noted that the Qatari leadership harbored "no 
<br>illusions" about Iran.  Prince Hamad had told the Israelis in 
<br>October 2006 that he believed Iran was determined to develop 
<br>a nuclear bomb no matter the cost.  According to Hadas, Hamad 
<br>complained at the time that he felt the U.S. would not listen 
<br>to him and tended to believe what it heard from Iran. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (S) Hadas reiterated the point he had made to Feltman 
<br>regarding Oman, calling the Omanis the "most problematic" of 
<br>the Gulf states in terms of their view of Iran.  With regard 
<br>to Omani contacts with Israel, Hadas said they were 
<br>"correct," but the Omanis never fulfilled their commitment to 
<br>open an Israeli office in Muscat.  He said Oman has "its own 
<br>definition" of what poses a threat to the Gulf, partly due to 
<br>Oman's geographical location.  He did not think Oman would be 
<br>willing to join the rest of the GCC against Iran. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (S) Hadas agreed that the UAE was increasingly hostile to 
<br>Iran, but there remained a question as to how far they were 
<br>prepared to go.  The UAE has extensive trade and financial 
<br>relations with Iran, including money laundering, and it was 
<br>unclear whether they were ready to use these relations as 
<br>leverage.  Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdallah has developed 
<br>good personal relations with Foreign Minister Livni, but the 
<br>Emiratis are "not ready to do publicly what they say in 
<br>private."  (Note:  It was clear from Hadas' remarks that 
<br>Israel's channel to Saudi Arabia does not run through the 
<br>Foreign Ministry.) 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (S) Hadas said the Gulf Arabs believe in Israel's role 
<br>because of their perception of Israel's close relationship 
<br>with the U.S. but also due to their sense that they can count 
<br>on Israel against Iran.  "They believe Israel can work 
<br>magic," Hadas commented.  When considering a trilateral 
<br>U.S.-Israel-GCC partnership, Hadas suggested we bear in mind 
<br>that Iran's nuclear program is the primary source of concern 
<br>to the U.S. and Israel, while the Gulf Arabs also worry about 
<br>Iran for a host of historic and sectarian reasons. 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (C) PolCouns noted that Arabs say that progress on the 
<br>Palestinian track would make it easier for them to publicly 
<br>engage Israel.  Hadas countered that while peace with the 
<br>Palestinians is an Israeli interest and important in its own 
<br>right, it should not be the sum total of Israel's relations 
<br>with the Arab World.  Arab League Secretary General Amre 
<br>Moussa had invented the "never-ending hurdle race" in which 
<br>Israel could never do enough to deserve a positive response. 
<br>The Israeli-Palestinian track should not serve as an excuse 
<br>for the Gulf to avoid action, whether against Iran or through 
<br>practical steps to support the Palestinian Authority.
