<br>SUBJECT: PROVOCATIONS FROM RUSSIAN SECURITY SERVICES 
<br>
<br>REF: MOSCOW 00202 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador John Beyrle. Reason: 1.4 (d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) Summary. With their usual light touch and unique sense 
<br>of timing, the security services appear to be tightening the 
<br>screws on what they see as Russia's internal and foreign 
<br>enemies along three fronts. First was a confidential letter 
<br>from the Federal Security Service (FSB) demanding that USAID 
<br>stop funding NGOs in the North Caucasus. Second, the Interior 
<br>Ministry has brought pressure on the liberal Higher School of 
<br>Economics to expel students who took part in anti-government 
<br>demonstrations in December. Third, and most disturbing, we 
<br>believe the FSB is behind a personal smear attack
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX the National Democratic Institute's Moscow
<br>office (NDI) that was emailed to NDI and USAID staff this week.
<br>The second provocation has become a public issue, with 
<br>critical articles even in the popular tabloid, Moskovskiy 
<br>Komsomolets, on Ren TV, and commentary on prominent blog 
<br>sites. Taken together, we assess that hard-line silovik 
<br>elements are testing the political waters at home and 
<br>potentially making waves at a time of otherwise positive 
<br>signals of interest in improving US-Russian relations. End 
<br>Summary. 
<br>
<br>Warning to USAID 
<br>---------------- 
<br>¶2. (S) A January 17 letter from the FSB, sent through liaison 
<br>channels, explicitly warned against continued USAID funding 
<br>for NGOs in the North Caucasus. Citing a November trip by a 
<br>named USAID officer, the FSB alleged that US funding to the 
<br>region was "incompetent" and that USAID was not in a position 
<br>to guarantee that funds provided for humanitarian programs 
<br>did not fall into the hands of illegal armed groups. Given 
<br>the tensions in South Ossetia, as well as the conflict in the 
<br>Middle East, the FSB gave notice that "it is necessary to 
<br>refrain from financing any NGO in the North Caucasus, 
<br>regardless of USAID's goals." The letter closed with an 
<br>ominous admonition that unless USAID stops its "incompetent 
<br>actions," the FSB would implement strict preventative 
<br>measures, including the denial of visas. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) The FSB letter attempted to justify its position by 
<br>highlighting the complexity of nationalities and religions in 
<br>the North Caucasus, the prevalence of extremist movements, 
<br>and the predominant role played by family loyalties as 
<br>factors that made funding of NGOs in the region dangerous. 
<br>The FSB made implicit threats that information about US 
<br>funding of illegal groups would likely be made public through 
<br>the media, damaging US-Russian counterterrorism efforts. 
<br>Further, the letter noted that "incompetent actions" on the 
<br>part of the "Embassy sections, like USAID" could escalate 
<br>tensions in regions beyond the borders of the North Caucasus 
<br>to the detriment of US and Russian interests. When the 
<br>Ambassador protested this FSB salvo, Deputy Foreign Minister 
<br>Ryabkov claimed (credibly) that the security service 
<br>complaints had not been coordinated with the MFA. 
<br>
<br>Warning to Students 
<br>------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) In mid-January, the Moscow branch of the MVD issued 
<br>a letter to the Higher School of Economics, raising the issue 
<br>of four students (possibly six) who participated in December 
<br>opposition marches with the veiled recommendation that they 
<br>be expelled. According to press reports, the letter warned 
<br>"implementation of un-sanctioned mass acts was one of the 
<br>forms of extremist activity, carrying a high level of 
<br>societal danger, and demands adequate reactive measures on 
<br>the part of the law enforcement organs." The MVD called on 
<br>the institute to look into the circumstance of the students' 
<br>participation in the opposition protests and to consider the 
<br>efficacy of continuing their education. Further, the letter 
<br>sought comments from the heads of the Politics and Economics 
<br>departments about extremism, as well as personal statements 
<br>from the four students. MVD sources told the newspaper 
<br>Moskovskiy Komsomolets (MK) that they were "legally required" 
<br>to inform the place of employment or school of any citizens 
<br>violating social stability. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) The institute will hold a meeting on February 4 to 
<br>consider its response, but public comments by the director 
<br>and rector suggest that the school considers such political 
<br>activity to be a "personal" decision, beyond the scope of 
<br>institute censure. XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>"no way" that the institute would adhere to the 
<br>recommendations of the MVD and underscored the unanimity
<br>of  the faculty and student body on this issue. Nezavisimaya 
<br>Gazeta criticized the letter, seeing it as a demonstration of 
<br>the government's "panic" after the anti-tariff protests and 
<br>highlighting the "Soviet" aspect of going after politically 
<br>"unreliable" students. Besides the usual lineup of opposition 
<br>newspapers and websites, the MK article ensures that a 
<br>broader swath of society will learn about this incident -- 
<br>already it has spawned a sharp reaction of support for the 
<br>students and condemnation of the MVD in Russia's blogosphere. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX said that XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>was sure that other institutes and universities had received
<br>similar letters, but had chosen not to make the silovik
<br>demands public or had quietly capitulated. Our consulate
<br>in St. Petersburg noted last year's closing of the European
<br>University, ostensibly for "fire safety" issues, because of
<br>the Political Science department had taken a grant to do
<br>research on electoral politics in Russia. 
<br>
<br>Getting Ugly and Personal with NDI 
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) On January 29, USAID FSNs received an email from 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX with a photoshopped image of 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX reclining with an underage 
<br>child. The picture was attached to a message, ostensibly from 
<br>a Russian citizen, which accused XXXXXXXXXXXX of raping
<br>her  9-year old daughter. This latest provocation falls on the 
<br>heels of a scandal in Murmansk alleging NDI interference in 
<br>local elections and harassment of NDI staff XXXXXXXXXXXX. 
<br>The Ambassador met with representatives from NDI on January 
<br>30 on harassment of the NGO, reported septel. 
<br>
<br>Panic or Provocation 
<br>-------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Emboldened by the economic crisis, the silovik forces 
<br>have taken the initiative to stir the waters of Russian 
<br>politics, not only with those letters, but also with the 
<br>proposed revision of the law on treason, on jury trials, and 
<br>the heavy-handed response to the protests in Vladivostok. 
<br>Some of those initiatives have been blunted directly, such as 
<br>Medvedev's decision to revise the proposed law on treason, 
<br>others by publicizing the issue (the letter to the Higher 
<br>School of Economics, for example, received coverage in the 
<br>popular tabloid MK and on Ren TV) -- suggesting an 
<br>intensification of inter-elite conflict. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Comment. We cannot rule out that those provocations 
<br>may in part be directed at complicating efforts to improve 
<br>US-Russian relations. At a time when both Putin and Medvedev 
<br>have indicated the potential for starting with a clean slate 
<br>in relations with the new Obama administration, those within 
<br>the security services who see value (including to their 
<br>budgets) from continued tensions or whose world view is 
<br>predicated on US-Russia conflict are likely under pressure to 
<br>play a spoiler role. Ambassador plans to raise all of those 
<br>incidents forcefully in high-level meetings next week to send 
<br>a message back flagging the risks inherent in allowing rogue 
<br>elements to run amok in the relationship. End Comment.
