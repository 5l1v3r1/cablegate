<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: Opponents of a new bill before Italian
<br>parliament that would further regulate the Internet say it
<br>endangers free speech and is a threat to Italian democracy.
<br>The bill also appears to favor PM Berlusconi's Mediaset
<br>television service while disadvantaging Sky, one of its major
<br>competitors. The GOI says the bill is intended to implement
<br>an EU directive that harmonizes media regulation and that the
<br>provisions being criticised are designed to establish greater
<br>protection of copyrighted material, to protect children from
<br>inappropriate broadcasts, and to keep consumers from paying
<br>twice by being subjected to excessive advertising on pay-TV
<br>channels. Opponents say the law far exceeds the scope and
<br>spirit of the EU law and severely restricts free expression
<br>on the Internet. Due to advertising and content regulation
<br>in the bill, some have read it as an effort to give
<br>Berlusconi greater control over communication and to drive
<br>out Mediaset's competitors. Implementation of the bill has
<br>been postponed from its original date of January 27 and
<br>parliament is holding hearings on the matter. The GOI
<br>appears open to discussion of the bill's text. While
<br>reaction to the bill has been strong among opposition
<br>politicians and telecom professionals, the issue has not made
<br>it to the front pages of newspapers so there has been no
<br>strong public reation. Despite GOI protestations, the bill
<br>is troubling as it appears to have been written to give the
<br>government enough leeway to block or censor any Internet
<br>content. END SUMMARY
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) According to the GOI, the Romani Bill (named for
<br>Paolo Romani, Deputy Economic Development Minister, who
<br>covers communications issues) is designed to implement EU
<br>Directive 2007/65CE, which aims to harmonize media regulation
<br>in the EU. Many telecom sector professionals, however,
<br>believe that the bill vastly exceeds the scope and spirit of
<br>the EU law. The bill is complex, but there are three primary
<br>areas of concern: limits to uploading on the Interet,
<br>television advertising ceilings, and limits to content aimed
<br>for adults, which would also restrict films judged by the
<br>Italian rating system as being for those 14 and older. This
<br>would likely include the vast majority if not all
<br>U.S.-produced PG-13 movies.

<br>
<br>¶3. (U) Provisions contained in the bill would make Internet
<br>service providers (ISPs), and hosting sites such as Blogspot
<br>and YouTube, liable for content in the same way a television
<br>station is. In the strictest interpretation of the law, the
<br>sites and ISPs would have to monitor all content on their
<br>sites, content which is uploaded by millions of individual
<br>users. This is widely viewed as impossible both in practical
<br>and economic terms. The Italian Communications Authority
<br>(AGCOM) would be responsible for oversight of the law, and
<br>some have interpreted the bill as requiring government
<br>permission before a video could be uploaded.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Antonello Busetto, director of institutional relations
<br>for Confindustria Servizi Innovativi e Tecnologici, a
<br>business association representing the interests of IT
<br>companies, said the measure would mean "the death of the
<br>Internet in Italy."
<br>
<br>¶5. (U) Italian communications commissioner Nicola D'Angelo
<br>was quoted in the press as saying, "Italy will be the only
<br>Western country in which it is necessary to have prior
<br>government permission to operate this kind of service...This
<br>aspect reveals a democratic risk, regardless of who happens
<br>to be in power." Likewise, AGCOM president Corrado Calabro
<br>has said that Italy would be unique in the West as imposing
<br>Internet restrictions until now only imposed by authoritarian
<br>governments.
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) The GOI says the measure is aimed at protecting
<br>copyrighted material from being uploaded and downloaded
<br>
<br>ROME 00000125 002 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>illegally, as well as at monitoring other potentially illegal
<br>activity on the Internet. The copyright industry has
<br>expressed some limited approval of the bill. Enzo Mazza,
<br>president of the Italian Music Federation, said the music
<br>industry is generally in favor of making ISPs and sites more
<br>responsible for protecting copyrighted material, though, he
<br>added that his industry's analysis of the bill was focused on
<br>this aspect and not other implications.
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) Because this could make ISPs and opinion sites
<br>liable for defamation in the way television broadcasts are,
<br>some see this as an effort to control political discourse on
<br>the Internet. Others see a commercial angle aimed at limiting
<br>the video and TV available on the Internet as Mediaset moves
<br>into the Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) market.
<br>Alessandro Gilioli, who writes a blog for the liberal weekly
<br>magazine Espresso wrote "It's the Berlusconi method: Kill
<br>your potential enemies while they are small. That's why
<br>anyone doing Web TV -- even from their attic at home -- must
<br>get ministerial approval and fulfill a host of other
<br>bureaucratic obligations."
<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU) AGCOM would have the authority to enforce the law.
<br>Among the authority's powers would be the ability to block
<br>traffic into Italy of sites whose content did not meet the
<br>requirements of the law. For example, YouTube could be
<br>blocked because the content was not uploaded with government
<br>approval. AGCOM would also be able to levy fines of up to
<br>150,000 euros against foreign companies violating the law.
<br>Though AGCOM is theoretically an independent agency, many
<br>fear that it may not be strong enough to resist political
<br>pressure.

<br>ADVERTISING CEILINGS
<br>- - - - - - - - - - -
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) The bill would place limits on advertising on pay-TV
<br>channels that exceed the EU directive. It would reduce the
<br>EU ceiling of 20% to 12% in Italy by 2012. The provision
<br>would penalize Sky in particular. Some argue that the
<br>measure is designed to favor PM Berlusconi's free-to-air
<br>Mediaset channels, which would not be subject to the limit.
<br>Mediaset's pay channels would be subject to the advertising
<br>ceiling, but Mediaset's channels currently have less than 12%
<br>each hour dedicated to ads. In addition, reducing the
<br>overall possibility to advertise on pay-TV would push
<br>advertising towards free channels operated by Mediaset and by
<br>the Italian state network RAI. Busetto said this would allow
<br>Berlusconi to earn more money and also to exercise greater
<br>control of public information.
<br>
<br>- - - - - - - - -
<br>ADULT CONTENT
<br>- - - - - - - - -
<br>
<br>¶10. (SBU) The bill places stringent time restrictions on
<br>broadcasting of so-called "adult content," virtually
<br>prohibiting it between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. Pay channels such
<br>as those offered by Sky would be subject to the restrictions;
<br>it appears pay-per-view content would be as well. Because
<br>they obtain a significant part of their income from pay adult
<br>content, pay-TV would suffer financially from this
<br>restriction. The bill would limit broadcast of any film
<br>rated for viewers above age 14 to after 10:30 p.m. One press
<br>report said this would make films such as Saturday Night
<br>Fever unavailable until late-night. Again, some opponents
<br>worry that the objective is to hurt Mediaset's competition.
<br>

<br>EU OPINION
<br>- - - - - - - -
<br>
<br>¶11. (U) Opinion at the EU appears to be conflicting.
<br>According to press reports, the EU is threatening to start an
<br>infraction procedure against Italy for failing to swiftly
<br>implement the media directive. At the same time, other press
<br>reports say the restrictions in the Italian bill would
<br>likely violate the EU e-commerce directive.

<br>COMMENT
<br>- - - - - - -
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) In official statements the government insists the
<br>bill is in no way intended to stifle free speech. Opponents
<br>are vocal and using alarmist language, but outside of telecom
<br>industries their numbers appear to be small. There has been
<br>no visible public outrage, and even Beppe Grillo, a public
<br>personality usually outspoken about government regulation,
<br>especially that involving the Internet, has said very little.
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) After Berlusconi was attacked in Milan in December
<br>and a Facebook fan page for his attacker quickly amassed
<br>fans, the GOI expressed the need for regulation of social
<br>networking sites. At that time, Romani said the government
<br>would work with ISPs and sites to develop a method of
<br>self-regulation and that there would be no attempt to
<br>legislate internet content. Despite Romani's prior
<br>statements, this bill appears to have been written to give
<br>the government enough leeway to block or censor any Internet
<br>content it deems defamatory or to be encouraging criminal
<br>activity.
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) For years, the USG has urged the GOI to take action
<br>to protect copyrighted material on the Internet, in
<br>particular encouraging the establishment of clear
<br>notice-and-takedown procedures and cooperation among rights
<br>holders and ISPs to prevent illegal filesharing. Italy has
<br>done very little. Now, this bill skips over collaboration,
<br>and suddenly moves directly to very stern regulation. In
<br>light of its reluctance to take action on this issue in the
<br>past, and also given the many commercial advantages that this
<br>law appears to give Mediaset and state TV, the GOI claim that
<br>Internet provisions of this law are aimed at copyright
<br>protection alone are suspect.
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) In all liklihood, if this bill were to become law as
<br>it is currently written, little would change immediately in
<br>the way Internet sites operate in Italy, and the average 11th
<br>grader uploading video to his blog would never be targeted
<br>for legal action. It would, however, provide a basis for
<br>legal actions against media operators that proved to be
<br>commercial or political competition for government figures.
<br>Over the last three years we have seen several GOI efforts to
<br>exert control over the Internet, including one infamous
<br>effort to require bloggers to obtain GOI journalism licenses.
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) Advocates of Internet freedom have repeatedly warned
<br>us that Italy's traditional elites -- on both sides of the
<br>political spectrum -- are very uncomfortable with the
<br>Internet's ability to bypass the traditional media that they
<br>control. Becasue this new bill seems to address these kinds
<br>of concerns, and because it also serves Berlusconi's business
<br>interests, it is conceivable that this seemingly improbable
<br>legislation might actually come into force in Italy. We note
<br>that officers from SKY have told us that Deputy GOI Minister
<br>Romani (for whom the new bill is named) has been leading
<br>efforts within the GOI to help Berlusconi's Mediaset and to
<br>put SKY at a disadvantage. This represents a familiar
<br>pattern: Berslusoni and Mediaset have been using government
<br>power in this way ever since the days of Prime Minister
<br>Bettino Craxi. In addition, this bill would set precidents
<br>that nations such as china could copy or cite as
<br>justification for their own crackdowns on free speech.
