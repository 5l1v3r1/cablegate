<br>E.O. 11652: GDS 
<br>TAGS: PINT IR
<br>SUBJECT: IRANIAN RESURGENCE PARTY CREATED BY SHAH 
<br>
<br>SUMMARY: CREATION OF IRANIAN RESURGENCE PARTY ANNOUNCED BY SHAH 
<br>MARCH 2 IS MOVE TO SEEK BROADER SUPPORT FOR MONARCHY AND THE SHAHPEOPLE 
<br>REVOLUTION. ALL IRANIANS OF VOTING AGE ARE EXPECTED TO 
<br>EXPRESS ALLEGIANCE TO NEW PARTY OR RISK BEING VIEWED AS OPPONENTS 
<br>OF SHAH AND EVEN TRAITORS WHO SHOULD LEAVE IRAN OR GO TO PRISON. 
<br>SHAH EXPLAINED IRAN'S RETURN TO SINGLE PARTY SYSTEM AS NECESSARY 
<br>BECAUSE QTE SHAMEFUL UTTERANCES UNQTE BY SOME IRANIANS SHOWED NEED 
<br>FOR IRANIANS TO CLOSE RANKS IN EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE QTE GREAT 
<br>CIVILIZATION, UNQTE AND BECAUSE OPPOSITION PARTIES HAD FAILED. 
<br>ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR SUMMER WILL APPARENTLY BE HELD, BUT IT IS 
<br>NOT CLEAR HOW THEY WILL BE ORGANIZED. NET RESULT IS TO MAKE 
<br>IRANIAN POLITICAL SYSTEM LESS FLEXIBLE. INTERNATIONAL REACTION 
<br>WILL PROBABLY RANGE FROM INDIFFERENCE TO CHARGES OF INCREASED 
<br>TOTALITARIANISM. SHAH APPARENTLY PLANS TO CONTINUE ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT 
<br>IN DAILY POLITICAL AFFAIRS. THIS IS CONTRARY TO EARLIER SUGGESTIONS 
<br>THAT HE MIGHT BE MOVING GRADUALLY TO CONFINE HIMSELF TO 
<br>BROAD POLICY GUIDANCE AND LEAVE IMPLEMENTATION TO GOVERNMENT. END 
<br>SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>¶1. SHAH'S LENGTHY STATEMENT AT HIS MARCH 2 PRESS CONFERENCE, FROM 
<br>WITH CORRESPONDENTS FOR FOREIGN MEDIA WERE EXCLUDED, (TEXT SENT BY 
<br>AIRGRAM) ESTABLISHED IRANIAN RESURGENCE PARTY. NEW PARTY WILL 
<br>ABSORB RULING IRAN NOVIN PARTY, LOYAL OPPOSITION MARDOM PARTY, 
<br>AND THE ULTRA-NATIONALIST PAN IRANIST PARTY AND ITS SPLINTER 
<br>GROUP THE IRANIANS PARTY. PRIME MINISTER HOVEYDA IS TO BE SECRETARY 
<br>GENERAL FOR A PERIOD OF AT LEAST TWO YEARS. SHAH WILL LATER 
<br>PROPOSE CHAIRMAN OF NEW PARTY'S EXECUTIVE BOARD AND PRESIDENT FOR 
<br>ITS POLITICAL BUREAU. A PARTY CONGRESS WILL BE HELD, PERHAPS 
<br>WITHIN TWO MONTHS. GENERAL ELECTIONS WILL BE HELD THIS SUMMER 
<br>UNDER AUSPICES OF NEW PARTY. 
<br>
<br>¶2. SHAH'S STATEMENT BEGAN WITH FAMILIAR RECITATION OF IRAN'S 
<br>GROWING SELF-RELIANCE AND ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE CONTRASTING SHARPLY 
<br>WITH ITS RELATIVE WEAKNESS IN FIRST HALF OF CENTURY. HE NOTED THAT 
<br>OPPOSITION PARTIES WERE CREATED IN RESPONSE TO HIS OWN WISHES 
<br>AND COMMENTED THAT THEY HAD BEEN FACED WITH A DIFFICULT TASK. 
<br>SHAH OBSERVED THAT THEY HAD FAILED TO FULFILL THEIR PROPER ROLE. HE 
<br>COMMENTED THAT SOME IRANIANS HAD MADE QTE SHAMEFUL UTTERANCES 
<br>UNQTE WHICH REFLECTED A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF IRAN' GOALS. IN 
<br>ORDER TO WELD ALL IRANIANS TOGETHER IN PURSUIT OF GOALS OF THE 
<br>SHAH-PEOPLE REVOLUTION, HE HAD, THEREFORE, DECIDED TO CREATE NEW 
<br>ORGANIZATION WHICH WOULD SUPPRESS PARTY DIFFERENCES. ONLY REQUIREMENTS 
<br>FOR MEMBERSHIP IN NEW ORGANIZATION WOULD BE LOYALTY TO (1) 
<br>MONARCHY, (2) IRAN'S CONSTITUTION, AND (3) SIXTH OF BAHMAN (SHAHPEOPLE) 
<br>REVOLUTION. HE SPECIFICALLY SAID NEW PARTY WOULD FOSTER 
<br>CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM, AND HE PREDICTED THAT POLITICAL WINGS 
<br>WOULD EVOLVE WITHIN NEW PARTY. HE URGED ALL IRANIANS ELIGIBLE TO 
<br>VOTE TO ENTER INTO NEW POLITICAL STRUCTURE OR CLARIFY THEIR POSITION. 
<br>BY THIS HE MEANT THAT THOSE WHO COULD NOT AGREE WITH THE 
<br>THREE PRINCIPLES SHOULD LEAVE IRAN OR GO TO PRISON AS TRAITORS 
<br>UNLESS THEY OPENLY EXPRESSED THEIR DISAPPROVAL AND WERE NOT ANTINATIONAL. 
<br>IF DISAPPROVAL IS IDEOLOGICAL, PERSON WOULD REMAIN FREE 
<br>IN IRAN BUT QTE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY EXPECTATIONS UNQTE. FULL 
<br>PARTICIPATION IN IRAN'S PROGRESS WOULD OBVIOUSLY REQUIRE MEMBERSHIP 
<br>IN THE IRAN RESURGENCE PARTY. HE SAID IT WAS HIS EXPECTATION 
<br>THAT WORKERS, FARMERS, AND TEACHERS WOULD BE THE FIRST GROUPS TO 
<br>ANNOUNCE THEIR LOYALTY TO THE NEW PARTY. 
<br>
<br>¶3. COMMENT: ABOVE ALL, SHAH'S ACTION IN RETURNING TO SINGLE PARTY 
<br>SYSTEM OF 1964-67 PERIOD SHOWS HIS EXTREME SENSITIVITY TO CRITICISM 
<br>AND STRONG DESIRE TO RECEIVE OVERT EVIDENCE OF POPULAR SUPPORT. 
<br>AFTER HE EXPERIMENTED WITH TAME OPPOSITION PARTIES IN 
<br>1956-64 PERIOD WITH POOR RESULTS, SHAH THEN TURNED TO HASSAN ALI 
<br>MANSUR'S PROGRESSIVE SOCIETY TO CREATE IRAN NOVIN PARTY AS INSTRUMENT 
<br>TO IMPLEMENT HIS SIXTH OF BAHMAN REVOLUTION. MARDOM PARTY 
<br>WAS SUBSEQUENTLY REJUVENATED TO STIMULATE IRAN NOVIN TO PERFORM 
<br>MORE EFFECTIVELY. DESPITE CONSTANT STATEMENTS OF LOYALTY TO SHAH 
<br>AND HIS PLANS FOR IRAN, PARTIES HAVE APPARENTLY NOT PLEASED HIM. 
<br>AS INDICATED BY FAILURES OF FORMER MARDOM PARTY SECRETARIES 
<br>GENERAL ALI NAQI AND NASSER AMERI, EVEN ACTIVITIES OF GELDED 
<br>OPPOSITION HAD PROVED TOO CRITICAL FOR SHAH'S TASTE. NEVERTHELESS 
<br>HIS PAST STATEMENTS INDICATED CONTINUING SUPPORT FOR COCCEPT OF 
<br>MULTI-PARTY SYSTEM IN IRAN, AND IMPERIAL DECISION TO INSTITUTE ONEPARTY 
<br>STATE REPRESENTS 180-DEGREE SHIFT IN POLICY WHICH ALSO 
<br>APPEARS TO NEGATE EARLIER PROMISES OF FREER ELECTIONS LATER THIS 
<br>YEAR. KEY SECTION OF SPEECH IS COMMENT THAT HE HAD HEARD QTE SOME 
<br>REALLY SHAMEFUL UTTERANCES, WHICH IN NOW WAY SHOULD BE EXPECTED 
<br>FROM AN IRANIAN. THIS SCENE, OF COURSE, HAS ALWAYS RECURRED WHEN 
<br>IRAN HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN THE DEFENCE OF ITS RIGHTS AT A HISTORIC 
<br>JUNCTURE. THIS SITUATION IS INTOLERABLE, UNQTE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES 
<br>WE DOUBT THAT MUCH CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM WILL EMERGE 
<br>FROM THE IRANIAN RESURGENCE PARTY. 
<br>
<br>¶4. IN OPERATIONAL TERMS LITTLE HAS CHANGED, FOR DESPITE FACADE OF 
<br>QTE ME-TOO UNQTE OPPOSITION PARTIES SHAH HAS ALWAYS CALLED THE 
<br>TUNE AND ONLY RULING IRAN NOVIN PARTY HAD ANY IMPORTANCE. PRIME 
<br>MINISTER HAS BEEN LEAD DANCER, AND HIS SELECTION AS SECGEN AT 
<br>JANUARY PARTY CONGRESS HAD TIED IRAN NOVIN PARTY EVEN CLOSER TO 
<br>SHAH. IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCE OF NEW MOVE HAS BEEN FLOOD OF STATEMENTS 
<br>OF LOYALTY TO SHAH, CONSTITUTION AND REVOLUTION, BOTH BY 
<br>GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS. THERE IS CLEARLY NO VIABLE ALTERNATIVE FOR 
<br>IRANIANS WHO WANT TO PARTICIPATE ACTIVELY IN IRAN'S DEVELOPMENT 
<br>AND SHARE ITS PROSPERITY. ALL DIFFERENCES OF VIEW ON HOW TO IMPLEMENT 
<br>SHAH'S PLAN FOR IRAN WILL BE SUPPRESSED UNTIL NEW PARTY 
<br>DEVELOPS AN IDEOLOGY AND ITS LEADERSHIP IS CONSTITUTED. 
<br>
<br>¶5. SHAH'S SPEECH IS VAGUE ON GOALS OF IRANIAN RESURGENCE PARTY AND 
<br>MANY OTHER POINTS. IT IS NOT CLEAR, FOR EXAMPLE, HOW CANDIDATES 
<br>WILL BE SELECTED FOR SUMMER ELECTIONS AND ON WHAT PLATFORMS THEY 
<br>WILL RUN. SPEECH SHOWS SIGNS OF HURRIED PREPARATION FOR ISSUANCE 
<br>PRIOR TO HIS DEPARTURE FOR ALGIERS. WHILE MOST IRANIANS WILL 
<br>ACCEPT NEW CHANGE WITH TYPICAL CYNICISM, IMPLIED CRITICISM OF ALL 
<br>PARTIES FOR FAILING TO GET BEHIND SHAH'S PUSH FOR REVOLUTION FROM 
<br>THE TOP MAY ALIENATE SOME PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO HAVE 
<br>WORKED HARD FOR IRAN NOVIN PARTY ON ASSUMPTION THEY WERE CARRYING 
<br>OUT SHAH'S WISHES. 
<br>
<br>¶6. INTERNATIONAL REACTION WILL PROBABLY VARY FROM INDIFFERENCE TO 
<br>INCREASINGLY SHRILL CHARGES OF TOTALITARIANISM. IRAN'S IMAGE AS 
<br>COUNTRY IN WHICH ALL ELEMENTS WERE BEING TAPPED IN DEVELOPMENT 
<br>PROCESS MAY SUFFER UNLESS NEW PARTY'S MEMBERSHIP COMES FROM BROAD 
<br>SPECTRUM. IT APPEARS THAT EARLIER SUCCESSFUL IRANIAN POLICY OF 
<br>COMPROMISE AND COOPERATION HAS BEEN REPLACED BY QTE TAKE IT OR 
<br>LEAVE IT UNQTE STANCE IN DEALING WITH OPPOSITION. 
<br>
<br>¶7. IN A-19 EMBASSY NOTED THAT SHAH HOPES TO MOVE TOWARD SITUATION 
<br>IN WHICH HE GIVES POLICY GUIDANCE BUT KEEPS HIS DISTANCE FROM 
<br>DAILY ACTIVITIES OF GOVERNMENT. INITAL IMPRESSION OF HIS ACTION IN 
<br>CREATING NEW POLITICAL PARTY AND FORECASTING HIS PERSONAL SELECTION 
<br>OF SOME OF ITS LEADERS IS THAT HE HAS RETURNED TO MORE DIRECT 
<br>INVOLVEMENT IN THE BUSINESS OF GOVERNMENT. BETTER JUDGMENT ON THIS 
<br>POINT CAN BE MADE WHEN FUNCTION OF NEW PARTY BECOME CLEAR. 
<br>
<br>¶8. IN SUM, GIVEN EXISTING STRICT DEGREE OF POLITICAL CONTROLS, 
<br>SHAH'S DECISION TO MELD ALL POLITICAL PARTIES INTO ONE APPEARS TO 
<br>OFFER LITTLE IN WAY OF IMPROVEMENTS TO IRANIAN POLITICAL SYSTEM 
<br>WHILE ADDING SEVERAL DISADVANTAGES BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY.
