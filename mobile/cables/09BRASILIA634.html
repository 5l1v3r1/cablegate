<br>
<br>Classified By: Charge d'Affaires Lisa Kubiske. Reason: 1.4(d) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST. With two months 
<br>remaining before the Government of Brazil decides on a next 
<br>generation fighter aircraft, the U.S. competitor, Boeing's 
<br>F18 Super Hornet is still perceived by many Brazilians in and 
<br>outside the GOB as a likely second or even third-place 
<br>finisher, despite having the best aircraft and best offset 
<br>package. Most Brazilian contacts tell us that they do not 
<br>believe the USG is supporting the sale strongly, raising 
<br>doubts in their minds about our long term reliability as a 
<br>partner. Between now and July, there will be several 
<br>opportunities to assure the Brazilians at senior levels that 
<br>the USG will be behind the sale. Paragraphs 3-7 below 
<br>contain proposed steps to address key Brazilian concerns and 
<br>maximize chances for selection of the U.S. competitor. Among 
<br>these steps, high level contacts, especially by the President 
<br>and Secretary will be critical to overcome the perception of 
<br>a lack of U.S. support. We also need to underscore our 
<br>assurances that technology transfer has been approved and 
<br>highlight the superiority of Boeing's proposal to that of its 
<br>French competitor. As noted reftels, Embassy believes State 
<br>will play a critical role in roviding assurances that will be 
<br>essential to a winning bid. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) As the FX2 competition moves into its final 
<br>stages, the U.S. has a strong offer from Boeing for the F18 
<br>Super Hornet that comes with a huge package of industrial 
<br>cooperation and a competitive overall cost. While we can be 
<br>confident that the Super Hornet would be Brazil,s choice 
<br>based on its superior capabilities and attractive offset 
<br>package, it still has no better than a fifty/fifty chance of 
<br>success because of political support for the French 
<br>competitor and a lingering belief among some Brazilian 
<br>leaders that a close relationship with the U.S. may not be to 
<br>Brazil,s advantage. Winning the FX2 endgame, therefore, 
<br>will depend on an effective strategy to overcome our 
<br>political disadvantages and allow the Super Hornet,s 
<br>superiority be the deciding factor. Such a strategy must 
<br>address several key issues: 
<br>
<br>Perception of a lack of USG support 
<br>----------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) With the French sale effort being managed directly 
<br>from President Sarkozy,s cabinet and ongoing Swedish 
<br>engagement on the Ministerial level, the USG is perceived by 
<br>most Brazilians as lukewarm at best in its support for the 
<br>FX2 sale. This is a critical disadvantage in a Brazilian 
<br>society that depends on personal relationships as a 
<br>foundation for business. The difficulty is exacerbated by 
<br>the separation between government and industry in the United 
<br>States. We cannot, for example, offer government financing 
<br>to support a state owned company as can our competitors. To 
<br>address this problem, high level contacts will be essential, 
<br>particularly from the Department of State which is assumed by 
<br>the Brazilian Air Force to be restrictive of mil-mil 
<br>ooperation. In such contacts, U.S. officials will need to 
<br>highlight expanding U.S.-Brazil partnership and how 
<br>cooperation with the United States as Brazil modernizes its 
<br>obsolescent military will not only provide the best 
<br>operational capabilities, but will enhance our overall 
<br>cooperation. This is why we have been forward leaning in 
<br>approving transfers of technology in support of this sale. 
<br>In addition to taking advantage of the near-term 
<br>opportunities for high level contacts presented by MOD 
<br>Jobim,s May 20 visit to Washington And Secretary Clinton,s 
<br>possible visit to Brazil in late May, Embassy believes that 
<br>phone calls between Presidents Obama and Lula, between NSA 
<br>Jones and Presidential Foreign Affairs Advisor Marco Aurelio 
<br>Garcia, and between SecDef Gates and MOD Jobim, would boost 
<br>our case significantly. 
<br>
<br>Tech Transfer 
<br>------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) Although the major decisions to approve the 
<br>
<br>BRASILIA 00000634 002 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>transfer of technology for the FX2 sale have been made, 
<br>Brazilian leaders continue to doubt U.S. ability to follow 
<br>through. While the problem has been mitigated by an 
<br>effective public affairs strategy, we still hear that, absent 
<br>specific high level State Department assurances, the 
<br>Brazilians cannot be sure. It may well be that the 
<br>Brazilians want to keep tech transfer doubts alive in order 
<br>to have a ready-made excuse for buying an inferior plane, 
<br>should political leaders decide to do so. Repeated concerns 
<br>about unreleasable source code could have a similar basis. 
<br>Finally, we have heard that there are concerns on Capitol 
<br>Hill about the possibility of a South American arms race. 
<br>Should these reach Brazilian ears, there will be additional 
<br>worries that Congress will intervene to block the sale. 
<br>Embassy recommends the following as next steps to strengthen 
<br>our case on tech transfer: 
<br>
<br>-- An advocacy letter from President Obama to President Lula 
<br>-- A letter from Secretary Clinton to MOD Jobim stating that 
<br>the USG has approved the transfer of all appropriate 
<br>technology. 
<br>-- Interagency guidance on source code (cleared for April 
<br>Revista Forca Area article) should be disseminated for use. 
<br>-- All high-level contacts, including by Secretaries of 
<br>State and Defense and POTUS should include reassurance that 
<br>tech transfer has been approved. 
<br>-- Washington agencies should begin consultations with 
<br>appropriate Hill staff as early as possible to overcome 
<br>misperceptions that arms sales to Brazil could be 
<br>destabilizing. 
<br>
<br>Financing 
<br>--------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) U.S. inability to offer government financing or 
<br>guarantees puts the Super Hornet at a significant 
<br>disadvantage to its competitors. EXIM is prohibited from 
<br>engaging in sales of defense articles, leaving Brazil to 
<br>depend on commercial financing at higher rates. According to 
<br>Washington agencies, it would be possible to seek 
<br>Congressional relief for EXIM to support the sale. This has 
<br>been done in the past on rare occasions. The Brazilian Air 
<br>Force finance office has told us that even a statement that 
<br>we are willing to seek such legislative action would be 
<br>considered a positive sign. Embassy recommends that 
<br>Washington explore the possibility of legislative action to 
<br>allow EXIM Financing and respond by the May 29 deadline to 
<br>the GOB request to provide information on government 
<br>financing options. 
<br>
<br>Making the Case 
<br>--------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) We have been successful in getting across the 
<br>points that the Super Hornet is a highly capable aircraft, 
<br>and now need to focus on the broader picture -- how 
<br>partnership on the fighter sale will yield benefits for both 
<br>sides both in military terms and in economic benefits. As 
<br>the world,s largest aerospace company, Boeing is able to 
<br>offer a much greater scope of opportunities for Brazilian 
<br>industry, including some outside of the FX2 offset program. 
<br>The early June visit of Brazilian legislators to Washington 
<br>will be an opportunity to get the message to political 
<br>leaders. By focusing on key Senators, we have the 
<br>opportunity to bring on board individuals who can influence 
<br>the decision makers and ensure that the people who will have 
<br>to approve spending Brazilian government money understand 
<br>that the F18 offers them the best value. Embassy will 
<br>continue to highlight tech transfer and Expand our message 
<br>to include economic benefits to Brazil of the Boeing 
<br>proposal. We also recommend the following: 
<br>
<br>-- Make an expert on the aerospace industry available for 
<br>interview to highlight economic health of Boeing compared to 
<br>its competitors. 
<br>-- Use visit of Brazilian Congress to drive home message 
<br>that partnership with the U.S. entails benefits to both sides 
<br>that go well beyond offset program. Ensure that Brazilian 
<br>Senators understand significantly lower life 
<br>cycle costs of the Super Hornet. 
<br>
<br>BRASILIA 00000634 003 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>-- Arrange for an interview of the SecDef, or other senior 
<br>Administration representative, with a prominent Brazilian 
<br>journalist to underline importance of U.S.-Brazilian 
<br>partnership and how the FX2 sale will help. 
<br>
<br>Attack the French Bid 
<br>--------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S/NF) Although the French offer a less capable fighter 
<br>at a higher cost, the Rafale has been the presumptive winner 
<br>since the inception of the FX2 competition. While the 
<br>technical evaluations of the aircraft should result in a 
<br>significant advantage for the Super Hornet, we need to take 
<br>steps to erode the French political edge. While a major 
<br>element of this will be highlighting Boeing,s lower cost, 
<br>there are several other measures that can make a case against 
<br>the French. The first step will be to remind the Brazilians 
<br>that their interest in the Rafale was driven by an assumption 
<br>that the United States would not release technology. Since 
<br>we have approved release of the relevant technology, we 
<br>should ask if Brazil still needs the French as a safety. 
<br>Over the last few months, the French sales effort has been 
<br>based on a misleading, if not fraudulent, claim that their 
<br>plane involves only French content (rendering it free of 
<br>meddlesome U.S. export controls). This is not the case. A 
<br>DTSA analysis found a high level of U.S. content, including 
<br>targeting systems, radar components and safety systems that 
<br>will require U.S. licenses. Next steps: 
<br>
<br>-- Although it does not appear that the tech data provided 
<br>with the French bid violated ITAR regs, PM/DDTC and DTSA 
<br>should continue to monitor French marketing to ensure 
<br>Dassault does not skirt ITAR restrictions. 
<br>-- Investigate India,s decision to drop the Rafale from its 
<br>fighter competition to see if there is a reason that would 
<br>make the aircraft less attractive to Brazil. 
<br>-- Ensure the Brazilians are aware that we expect to be 
<br>issuing retransfer licenses for U.S.-origin components on the 
<br>French plane and have already approved transfer of some 
<br>technical data.
