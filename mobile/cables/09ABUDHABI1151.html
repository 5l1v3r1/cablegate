<br>SUBJECT: ABU DHABI CROWN PRINCE WARNS DOE DEPSEC PONEMAN ABOUT IRAN 
<br> 
<br>CLASSIFIED BY: Richard G. Olson, Ambassador, State, US Embassy Abu 
<br>Dhabi, UAE; REASON: 1.4(B), (D) 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (S/NF) Summary: During a December 9 meeting in Abu Dhabi (other 
<br>meetings reported septel), Deputy Secretary of Energy Daniel 
<br>Poneman told Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed (MbZ) that 
<br>the USG shared many energy policy priorities with the UAE, 
<br>including renewable energy development and the importance of 
<br>critical energy infrastructure protection.  Poneman briefed MbZ on 
<br>the Teheran Research Reactor (TRR) proposal and Vienna talks.  MbZ 
<br>said he would be surprised if Iran accepted the P5+1/IAEA proposal 
<br>and warned that Iran was already acting like a nuclear power. 
<br>Further, and more dangerously, Iran is establishing "emirates" 
<br>across the Muslim world, including South Lebanon and Gaza, sleeper 
<br>"emirates" in Kuwait, Bahrain, and the Eastern Province of Saudi 
<br>Arabia, the mother of all "emirates" in Southern Iraq, and now 
<br>Saada in Yemen.  MbZ suggested that the U.S. is misreading the 
<br>situation in Yemen and failing to recognize strong evidence of 
<br>Iranian support.  End Summary. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>POTENTIAL COOPERATION: 
<br> 
<br>RENEWABLES, INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (SBU) The Crown Prince asked DepSec Poneman several questions 
<br>about U.S. energy development plans, including the outlook for the 
<br>next 25 years.  Poneman explained President Obama and Secretary Chu 
<br>have a strategic vision of a new energy economy with a low carbon 
<br>profile.  In the short term, Poneman said DOE is investing Recovery 
<br>Act funds to improve efficiency and support new technologies, but 
<br>that the USG seeks to facilitate energy development through a 
<br>portfolio approach, not dictate what the market should pursue. On 
<br>nuclear, MbZ specifically asked what progress could be expected 
<br>within the next three years.  Poneman said there are a number of 
<br>active deals under development, and strong public support for 
<br>nuclear power, but that capital costs continue to be a challenge. 
<br>(Comment:  MbZ pressed hard on US plans for a nuclear renaissance, 
<br>suggesting to us that he is worried we may compete with his program 
<br>in the hunt for nuclear engineering and technical talent. End 
<br>Comment.) Turning to renewable energy and efficiency, the DepSec 
<br>noted that USG goals are very much in line with Abu Dhabi's own 
<br>Masdar (Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company) and that he looked forward 
<br>to greater DOE-Masdar cooperation (septel). 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (SBU) Poneman also told MbZ that the USG is interested in 
<br>supporting Abu Dhabi's critical energy infrastructure protection 
<br>(CEIP) plans and said a DOE team was discussing cooperation 
<br>potential with the Critical National Infrastructure Authority 
<br>(CNIA, reported septel).  Learning from Hurricane Katrina, DOE was 
<br>focused on survivability of assets, resiliency and recovery.  MbZ 
<br>said he was personally very interested in greater cooperation with 
<br>the U.S. on CEIP, through DOE, other USG entities and/or the 
<br>private sector.  He stressed that citizens' confidence in their 
<br>government was very important, noting "We're doing our best to make 
<br>them feel secure."  MbZ added that while UAE is a small country, it 
<br>has the resources to protect itself, and is willing to invest in 
<br>top-quality infrastructure protection. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>IRAN 
<br> 
<br>---- 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (S/NF) DepSec Poneman briefed MbZ on the international proposal 
<br>for Iran to ship 1,200 kg of Low Enriched Uranium produced at 
<br>Natanz to a location outside Iran and where it would be enriched to 
<br>20 percent for use to produce medical radioisotopes at the Tehran 
<br>Research Reactor.  Poneman stressed that the IAEA, the Russians, 
<br>and the U.S. had all taken every possible step to address stated 
<br>Iranian concerns, including a first-ever official USG statement of 
<br>support for the proposal.  He stressed that the offer would not 
<br>remain open indefinitely; as DG El Baradei had said, this is a 
<br>"fleeting" opportunity.  He also explained that the extra effort 
<br>had strengthened international cooperation, with Russia and China 
<br>supportive of the recent IAEA Board of Governors resolution. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Poneman stressed that the deal was not offered out of naivete, but 
<br>rather out of the view that if Iran agreed it would remove a 
<br>significant amount of LEU from Natanz and if Iran refused it would 
<br>help build international support - beginning with Russia and China 
<br>- for tougher sanctions. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (S/NF) The Crown Prince said he would be "very surprised" if a 
<br>deal was possible, as Iran's nuclear program is not an issue of 
<br>internal conflict but rather one of national pride for the vast 
<br>majority of Iranians.  He stressed that Iran is not North Korea, 
<br>because 1) it is looking to reestablish a Persian empire in the 
<br>21st century, 2) Iran has resources and lacks neighbors, including 
<br>the UAE, who can pressure it, 3) the leadership has not changed (it 
<br>is the same people who seized Embassy Tehran in 1979) , and 4) Iran 
<br>believes itself to be a superpower.  Poneman said the USG does not 
<br>disagree with MbZ's analysis, but believes pride makes the Iranian 
<br>leadership more susceptible to the pressure of the world community 
<br>uniting against them, whereas North Korea revels in its own 
<br>isolation.  MbZ agreed, and emphasized the strategic importance of 
<br>creating a Palestinian State (i.e., resolving the 
<br>Israeli-Palestinian conflict) as the way to create genuine Middle 
<br>Eastern unity on the question of Iran's nuclear program and 
<br>regional ambitions. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>YEMEN 
<br> 
<br>----- 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (S/NF) MbZ said Iran already acts like a superpower and 
<br>explained that, while the UAE is a federation of emirates, Iran's 
<br>"emirates" have a larger army and budget that the UAE.  In addition 
<br>to Iran's established emirates in South Lebanon and Gaza, sleeper 
<br>emirates in Kuwait, Bahrain, the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, 
<br>and the mother of all emirates in Southern Iraq.  Now Iran has an 
<br>emirate in Saada.  MbZ told Poneman, "We believe you don't want us 
<br>to believe" the mounting evidence of Iranian involvement in Yemen. 
<br>He stressed that he doesn't believe Ali Abdullah Saleh either, but 
<br>this is "not like cracking the enigma code" (in World War II), 
<br>there are Iranian ships unloading weapons for the Houthis, and "you 
<br>have the capability to track this."  He warned, "We know your 
<br>priority is Al-Qaeda, but don't forget Iran. Al-Qaeda is not going 
<br>to get a nuclear bomb; Iran is a matter of time." 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (SBU) DepSec Poneman has cleared this cable.
