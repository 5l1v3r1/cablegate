<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Michele J. Sison for reasons 1.4 (b and d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Post has worked with the UAEG to have it
<br>focus on the issue of bulk cash smuggling. DHS/ICE has twice
<br>provided training to customs officials and DOJ/OPDAT will be
<br>providing money laundering prosecutorial training this
<br>December (which will have a bulk cash smuggling component).
<br>The USG proposed conducting a joint DHS/ICE - Dubai Customs
<br>cash courier operation in April 2006. This October, the UAE
<br>Central Bank Governor, who serves as the UAE's Chairman for
<br>the Joint Terror Finance Coordinating Committee, informed us
<br>that the UAEG did not wish to participate. (Note: Post still
<br>understands that the Central Bank Governor will be replaced
<br>and will raise this with his successor. End Note.) The UAE
<br>has regulations requiring declarations for cash imports of
<br>over USD 10,800, but no regulations covering cash exports.
<br>End Summary
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Post appreciates the opportunity to provide an update
<br>on our efforts to focus the UAEG on addressing the issue of
<br>bulk cash smuggling. DHS/ICE provided training to Dubai
<br>police and customs officials on detecting and investigating
<br>bulk cash smuggling cases in September 2005, and the issue
<br>has been raised at each of the U.S. - UAE Joint Terror
<br>Finance Coordinating Committee (JTFCC) meetings since their
<br>inception in January 2006. In the April 2006 JTFCC meeting,
<br>the U.S. side proposed holding a joint DHS/ICE - Dubai
<br>Customs cash courier operation. UAE Central Bank Governor
<br>Sultan Nasser Al-Suwaidi requested training before moving
<br>forward with any operation. That training was provided in
<br>June 2006 (ref c).
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) Al-Suwaidi then requested that post work with the
<br>UAE Central Bank and Customs to provide a "gap analysis" of
<br>the relevant U.S. and UAE regulations. In post's initial
<br>draft of a gap analysis, we determined that the UAE has no
<br>regulations on declaring cash exports, only on cash imports
<br>(ref b). We continued working with the Central Bank and with
<br>other members of the UAEG to address the UAE's stated and
<br>unstated concerns about a joint cash courier operation. Based
<br>on concerns the UAEG stated about having non-UAE nationals
<br>publicly involved in the operation, DHS/ICE revised the
<br>proposal and Ambassador passed it to Al-Suwaidi on August 1,
<br>¶2007. Al-Suwaidi promised to have the UAE's JTFCC review it.
<br>In October, during his visit to the U.S., Al-Suwaidi told
<br>Treasury U/S for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Stuart
<br>Levey that the UAE did not wish to pursue the proposed
<br>DHS/ICE - Dubai Customs cash courier operation with the USG,
<br>arguing that having U.S. DHS/ICE officials visible in UAE
<br>airports would not be acceptable. He did agree to continue a
<br>two-way discussion about certain at-risk flights and
<br>suggested the December meeting of the UAE's National
<br>Anti-Money Laundering Committee. Post still understands that
<br>the UAEG plans to change the Governor of the Central Bank.
<br>We will raise this issue again with the new governor,
<br>whenever that person comes on board.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Specific responses to questions follow (see 05 Abu
<br>Dhabi 4592 and 06 Abu Dhabi 3872 for more details).
<br>
<br>(U) Status of Host Nation Laws:
<br>---------------------------
<br>
<br>-- UAE Federal Law 4 of 2002 is the relevant law
<br>
<br>(SBU) Key Elements of UAE Federal Law 4 (2002) with regard to
<br>bulk cash smuggling):
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----------
<br>
<br>-- The law permits the import and export of any amount of
<br>currency. It requires, however, that cash and travelers
<br>checks worth 40,000 dirhams (USD 10,800) be declared. There
<br>are no requirements to declare exports of cash or to declare
<br>other bearer negotiable instruments such as bearer bonds, 3rd
<br>party endorsed checks, etc.
<br>
<br>-- Although there is a requirement to declare cash imports,
<br>the UAE does not provide customs declaration forms to
<br>airlines, etc (as does the U.S.). While there may be signs
<br>
<br>ABU DHABI 00001838 002 OF 002
<br>
<br>
<br>at some ports of entry laying out these requirements, it is
<br>not clear that they are at all points of entry.
<br>
<br>-- Although UAEG officials have the authority to seize
<br>undeclared cash, they do not have an administrative procedure
<br>for asset forfeiture. All cases must be brought to the
<br>courts. UAE officials have requested assistance in training
<br>prosecutors and judges in the understanding the importance of
<br>these cases and in how to make the case.
<br>
<br>-- The UAE Central Bank Governor has stated that the UAE
<br>would need to revise its regulations to deal with
<br>declarations on cash exports. As far as we are aware, these
<br>regulations have not yet been amended.
<br>
<br>(C) Status of investigations into bulk cash smuggling:
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---------
<br>
<br>-- The UAE is still largely a cash based society and Emiratis
<br>are used to carrying large amounts of cash. It is not clear
<br>that customs officials always initiate action against
<br>undeclared cash, nor is it clear how aggressively these cases
<br>are investigated or prosecuted. UAE officials have told us
<br>that they have investigated these cases and brought them to
<br>prosecution, but post has no independent access to records to
<br>determine the number of these cases, nor the success rate.
<br>
<br>(SBU) Mission Efforts
<br>---------------------
<br>
<br>-- In addition to the efforts briefly described in paras 1-2
<br>above, DOJ/OPDAT will be delivering training on December
<br>10-11 on prosecuting money laundering and financial crimes
<br>cases to prosecutors from the UAE. DHS/ICE will be
<br>delivering a presentation on bulk cash smuggling.
<br>
<br>-- Embassy will continue to engage the UAEG and Emirate level
<br>governments on the problem of cash couriers and the need to
<br>develop a plan to address the issue.
