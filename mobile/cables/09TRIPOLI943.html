<br>SUBJECT: LIBYAN MFA BRIEFED ON HEU SECURITY CONCERNS 
<br>
<br>REF: A) TRIPOLI 938, B) TRIPOLI 941 
<br>
<br>CLASSIFIED BY: Joan A. Polaschik, Charge d'Affaires, U.S. 
<br>Embassy Tripoli, Department of State. 
<br>REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 
<br>¶1. (S/NF) Pol/Econ Chief met MFA Americas Acting A/S-equivalent 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX December 1 to convey our serious 
<br>concerns about the security of the seven HEU-filled casks 
<br>at the Tajoura  Nuclear Facility. XXXXXXXXXXXX 
<br>dismissed U.S. concerns, stating there 
<br>was "no one sophisticated enough" in Libya to be able to do 
<br>anything with the casks and that the chances of anything 
<br>happening were very low. He mentioned the IAEA seals as 
<br>evidence that the fuel was protected (Ref A). Pol/Econ Chief 
<br>underscored that the GOL should be concerned about the 
<br>situation, as the casks were easily transportable and Tajoura 
<br>was a poorly protected facility. U.S. DOE specialists had 
<br>recommended an increased security guard presence -- armed if 
<br>possible -- around Tajoura and the disengagement of the crane 
<br>inside the facility. Pol/Econ Chief emphasized that the casks 
<br>were easily transportable, and advised him not to be too 
<br>dismissive of the security risks involved in keeping the casks 
<br>unprotected. XXXXXXXXXXXX said that he would meet with Foreign 
<br>Minister Musa Kusa today to relay our concerns. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) Pol/Econ Chief also described the environmental 
<br>disaster that could take place if we did not ship the casks to 
<br>Russia for disposal within a month. The U.S. needed a decision 
<br>from the Libyan side as soon as possible on the shipment, as it 
<br>would take time to reschedule the travel of the specialized 
<br>Russian plane, including overflight permits, landing permits, 
<br>and negotiating with the Russian MFA to cancel other scheduled 
<br>stops. XXXXXXXXXXXX was not aware of how complicated
<br> it would be to schedule a return visit of the plane, although he understood 
<br>that only a few such planes exist in the world. He said he 
<br>agreed that a decision needed to be passed to us within a few 
<br>weeks. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) XXXXXXXXXXXX was not aware that Dr. Gashut claimed to have 
<br>prepared a document for senior regime officials listing all of 
<br>the environmental dangers associated with holding the shipment 
<br>back. XXXXXXXXXXXX said that Gashut probably gave the paper to Prime 
<br>Mininster-equivalent al-Baghdad al-Mahmoudi (Gashut's boss) but 
<br>did not think it had been passed to the MFA. (XXXXXXXXXXXX may well 
<br>have been unaware of any communications between Gashut and Kusa 
<br>on this issue.) XXXXXXXXXXXX promised to call us after he had briefed 
<br>Kusa. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) We also are seeking a meeting with Saif al-Islam 
<br>al-Qadhaif's aide Mohamed Ismail Ahmed to relay the same 
<br>information, in hopes of ensuring that senior Libyan officials 
<br>understand the grave security and safety risks posed by the 
<br>halted shipment.
