<br>Summary
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Venezuelan Archbishop Baltazar Porras, head of the
<br>council of Catholic bishops of Venezuela, told Ambassador
<br>January 6 the USG ought to be more outspoken in its criticism
<br>of Hugo Chavez. Porras urged more international community
<br>involvement to contain Chavez's regional aspirations, though
<br>he admitted that political will to do so is minimal. He
<br>asserted that Chavez will continue to dismantle democratic
<br>civil society such as organized labor, the business sector,
<br>and the church. The Archbishop lamented the GOV's subtle
<br>campaign to sideline the church from its traditional work in
<br>poor neighborhoods, the educational system, and the military.
<br>End Summary.

<br>Senior Church Leader Urges Engagement, Containment
<br>--------------------------------------------- -----
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) At the invitation of the Papal Nuncio, the Ambassador
<br>attended a lunch on January 6 with Baltazar Porras,
<br>Archbishop of Merida and head of the Venezuela Council of
<br>Bishops (CEV). Porras, one of President Hugo Chavez's
<br>strongest public critics, told the Ambassador that there is
<br>widespread perception among the opposition that the USG
<br>softened its message against Chavez after the August 2004
<br>referendum because of energy interests. Porras suggested
<br>that the USG be more clear and public in its criticism of the
<br>Chavez administration.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Porras said the international community also needs to
<br>work and speak out more to contain Chavez and the export of
<br>his revolution. Porras said most regional governments have
<br>deferred to Brazilian President Ignacio "Lula" da Silva to
<br>handle Chavez because the two share leftist ideologies. Lula
<br>has been unwilling to engage, however, which has stymied
<br>regional efforts to contain Chavez, the Archbishop asserted.
<br>Porras said the Europeans have been just as weak on Chavez,
<br>especially since the departure of Spanish President Jose
<br>Maria Aznar. The Archbishop said that both Latin America and
<br>Europe need strong leadership from the USG.
<br>
<br>-------------------------
<br>Fighting Chavez Long Term
<br>-------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Porras described Chavez as a "long-term problem." He
<br>said Chavez will continue to dismantle civil society groups
<br>necessary to foster democratic rule: organized labor, the
<br>independent press, the business community, and the church.
<br>The Archbishop cited as an example the GOV efforts to
<br>penetrate the Catholic school system in Merida. GOV
<br>officials insisted that the Catholics accept "community
<br>representatives" on their school boards, and once accepted
<br>these individuals began to push revolutionary "reforms."
<br>Porras also noted reduced contacts with the military, which
<br>had traditionally invited him to change of command ceremonies
<br>but had not done so in more than three years.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Porras offered to facilitate any USG efforts at the
<br>community level to demonstrate that non-GOV entities -- the
<br>church, the private sector, etc. -- can have a positive
<br>impact on Venezuela's poor. He welcomed USG visits to church
<br>social programs in poor neighborhoods. Porras warned that
<br>the longer the USG waits, the more successful GOV will be at
<br>undermining traditional democratic organizations. He
<br>acknowledged an inherent conflict in his own analysis:
<br>Chavez is a long-term problem but the longer it takes to
<br>address, the stronger he becomes.
<br>

<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Porras and the rest of the Catholic leadership have
<br>kept low profiles since the referendum, the results of which
<br>they grudgingly accepted. Chavez has targeted the church,
<br>especially its leadership, which he sees as an ally of the
<br>previous political regime. Chavez has a long-running
<br>conflict as well with Porras, who was among the first to
<br>accuse Chavez of authoritarian tendencies. Rivalries aside,
<br>Porras is in touch with current domestic and international
<br>thought on Venezuela. The Catholic social projects Porras
<br>seeks to promote, while not on the scale of the GOV's
<br>"missions," do have a history of solidarity with Venezuela's
<br>poor that is not so easily undone, despite Chavez's efforts.
