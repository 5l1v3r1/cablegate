<br>SUBJECT: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE GATES'S MEETING WITH FRENCH FOREIGN 
<br>MINISTER KOUCHNER, FEBRUARY 8, 2010 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Alexander Vershbow, ASD/ISA.  Reasons 1.4 (b/d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (S/NF)  SUMMARY: At the request of the French Ministry of Foreign 
<br>Affairs, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates (SecDef) met with French FM 
<br>Bernard Kouchner in Paris on February 8, 2010.  Discussions included 
<br>how to persuade the Chinese and others to support sanctions against 
<br>Iran, and the importance of targeting the Iranian government rather 
<br>than the people. On Afghanistan, Kouchner confirmed that France would 
<br>maintain its position that it could not add additional combat troops 
<br>for the time being but was open to the possibility of sending 
<br>additional trainers.  Both Kouchner and SecDef lauded recent progress 
<br>in Pakistan.  Discussing NATO, Kouchner argued for a stronger European 
<br>pillar, which SecDef supported with the caution that pursuit of an 
<br>independent European security role risked reducing the already limited 
<br>capabilities available to the Alliance.  SecDef also raised the need 
<br>for reform and for examination of future NATO missions, which he would 
<br>define narrowly rather than broadly. END SUMMARY 
<br> 
<br>---- 
<br>Iran 
<br>---- 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (S/NF)  Kouchner said that the U.S. and France were working well 
<br>together in New York on an Iran sanctions resolution - all the problems 
<br>now are with the Chinese.  Kouchner had met Chinese FM Yang twice the 
<br>previous week, but said that right now it was difficult to predict 
<br>whether the Chinese would veto or abstain.  He noted that the Chinese 
<br>were furious over the U.S.-Taiwan arms deal, which would make it 
<br>difficult to get a resolution passed in February. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (S/NF) SecDef observed that Russia usually followed China's lead on 
<br>North Korea, whereas China usually followed Russia on Iran. Therefore 
<br>we should try to get the Russians to persuade the Chinese to support 
<br>the Iran sanctions resolution.  MFA political director Jacques Audibert 
<br>remarked that the Russians had been helpful during the last P5-plus-one 
<br>teleconference, but he worried that the Russians would water down the 
<br>content of the resolution. Kouchner said that President Medvedev seemed 
<br>strongly on board, and there was daylight between his position and that 
<br>of Foreign Minister Lavrov.  SecDef said he suspected that China 
<br>ultimately would not want to be isolated and would abstain. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (S/NF) SecDef urged Kouchner not to exaggerate the Chinese concern 
<br>over Taiwan - they would need a little more time and, in the end, an 
<br>abstention might be a good enough result for us.  He added that we 
<br>should urge the Saudis to weigh in with Beijing since China has more at 
<br>stake in its relations with Saudi Arabia than Iran.  He commented that 
<br>the Saudis always want to "fight the Iranians to the last American," 
<br>but that now it is time for them to get into the game. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (S/NF) Raising his concerns about bringing non-permanent UNSC 
<br>members on board, SecDef reported that in Ankara he had impressed upon 
<br>PM Erdogan the dangers of proliferation to other Middle East countries 
<br>or an Israeli strike if the Iranian nuclear program couldn't be 
<br>stopped.  Kouchner expressed his doubts about Turkey's desire for a 
<br>constructive role in region, describing Erdogan's comments to 
<br>Ahmadinejad defending the Iranian nuclear program as dangerous. 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (S/NF) Kouchner then asked SecDef for his perspectives on the 
<br>popular protests in Iran.  In the French view, the internal 
<br>developments were very important - the most significant change in 
<br>decades.  He urged careful thought about how to avoid discouraging the 
<br>protesters with sanctions, bearing in mind that the protesters did not 
<br>support Tehran's ambitions for nuclear weapons.  He further emphasized 
<br>his belief that human rights issues should receive attention as well. 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (S/NF) SecDef said that Kouchner's argument underscored the need to 
<br>focus sanctions on the IRGC and companies it owns, in order to minimize 
<br>the hardship for the Iranian people.  He remarked that Iranians across 
<br>the political spectrum support a peaceful nuclear program, but it was 
<br>not clear whether they favored acquisition of nuclear weapons. 
<br>Therefore, our political strategy should reaffirm Iran's right to have 
<br>a civilian nuclear program as long as it is safeguarded and in 
<br>compliance with the Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (S/NF) Further explaining the U.S. position, SecDef said that while 
<br>our understanding of the Iranian leadership was opaque, we do know that 
<br>they do not like to be isolated.  The USG would soon be designating 
<br>several IRGC companies under the Iran Sanctions Act.  His own view was 
<br>that it was important to get the UNSCR passed quickly, even if it were 
<br>not as harsh as we might wish.  Once a resolution is passed, he 
<br>explained, it will offer a legal platform on which the EU and 
<br>individual states can impose harsher sanctions. 
<br> 
<br>PARIS 00000174  002 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (S/NF) Kouchner agreed, but added that another problem was to get 
<br>the nine votes needed in the UNSC.  He said that Lebanon was one of 
<br>France's prime targets in this respect, but he doubted that France 
<br>would be able to bring the resolution to a vote during its presidency, 
<br>as February is a very short month.  Gabon, which takes the chair in 
<br>March, is a "good asset for France," he commented.  Audibert 
<br>interjected that the Russians had supported deleting some sections of 
<br>the draft UNSCR, but had approved including sanctions on the IRGC. 
<br>Kouchner said that France had to proceed carefully since a French woman 
<br>had been taken hostage in Tehran.  He disparaged FM Mottaki's 
<br>duplicitous performance in Munich. 
<br> 
<br>----------- 
<br>Afghanistan 
<br>----------- 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (S/NF) On Afghanistan, Kouchner confirmed that France would 
<br>maintain its position that it could not add additional combat troops 
<br>for the time being.  Pledging that France would stay "until the very 
<br>end," he said that the French would send 80 French trainers to Kabul on 
<br>their own, but were also looking into joint training opportunities with 
<br>Germany - possibly an OMLT. 
<br> 
<br>¶11.  (S/NF) Kouchner solicited SecDef's reaction to Karzai's idea of 
<br>local non-combat zones.  Gates said that he was not familiar with this 
<br>proposal but was skeptical about declaring zones where the government 
<br>could not use force since we could not enforce similar restraint on the 
<br>Taliban. 
<br> 
<br>¶12.  (S/NF) The U.S., SecDef said, supports reintegration and has money 
<br>in its military budget to support short-term efforts at integration 
<br>similar to the Sons of Iraq initiative in Anbar province.  Kouchner 
<br>commented that a key was to provide higher salaries to the ANA and ANP. 
<br> SecDef agreed, noting that salary increases in late 2009 had led to an 
<br>increase in recruits.  Kouchner said that this made sense as we were 
<br>fighting misery as well as terrorism. 
<br> 
<br>-------- 
<br>Pakistan 
<br>-------- 
<br> 
<br>¶13.  (S/NF) Turning to Pakistan, SecDef described the dramatic changes 
<br>that had taken place over the past year.  It was astonishing that 
<br>President Zadari had remained in power and that the Pakistanis had 
<br>conducted such effective COIN operations.  He noted that coordination 
<br>between ISAF and Pakistan's armed forces was improving - and this was 
<br>creating a more difficult situation for the Taliban along the border. 
<br>The Pakistan operation in South Waziristan had flushed out Taliban and 
<br>Al Qaeda elements; they were more vulnerable on the move.  Moreover, 
<br>Pakistan's aggressive campaign against the insurgency had won broad 
<br>political support among all political parties.  Operations in the West 
<br>and North-West had begun to accrue respect for Pakistan Army that 
<br>Musharraf had squandered.  It is important for all of us to talk to the 
<br>Pakistanis and provide economic assistance.  SecDef commented that one 
<br>can never be an optimist about Pakistan, but that the changes had been 
<br>striking.  Kouchner agreed with SecDef's analysis that the changes in 
<br>both the political and military spheres were "nothing short of a 
<br>miracle." 
<br> 
<br>----- 
<br>NATO 
<br>----- 
<br> 
<br>¶14.  (C) Kouchner then raised NATO, declaring that France was ready to 
<br>play its role in defining the Alliance's future strategy.  He said that 
<br>General Abrial (Supreme Allied Commander - Transformation) has offered 
<br>input, but emphasized that it was critical to come up with real 
<br>strategy that we could explain in debates in Parliament.  Kouchner 
<br>stressed that we needed to clarify NATO's roles and missions, as well 
<br>as its role in combating the threats of terrorism, poverty and 
<br>oppression.  SecDef agreed that the Strategic Concept should deal with 
<br>21st century security threats Q with an emphasis on the word 
<br>"security."   He said the Strategic Concept should also incorporate 
<br>lessons learned from Afghanistan - particularly the need for 
<br>comprehensive civil-military strategies and better partnership between 
<br>NATO and the EU and UN. 
<br> 
<br>¶15.  (C) SecDef said that NATO reform should proceed hand-in-hand with 
<br>an examination of Alliance threats and missions, either as a parallel 
<br>process or as a part of the Strategic Concept itself.  In this regard, 
<br>the Alliance cannot afford so many headquarters and needs to take steps 
<br> 
<br>PARIS 00000174  003 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>to reduce overhead. 
<br> 
<br>¶16.  (C) SecDef also stated that the Alliance should be clear as to 
<br>what NATO's limits are -- for example, it does not have role in the 
<br>Pacific.  We should adhere to the basic principle that NATO is about 
<br>the security of its member states.  We all face terrorist risks, and 
<br>there are many other new threats, but SecDef would be inclined to 
<br>define future missions narrowly rather than broadly. 
<br> 
<br>¶17. (S/NF) Kouchner highlighted piracy as an emerging issue on which 
<br>the EU and NATO were working together, although the real problem was 
<br>inside Somalia.  As an aside, he mentioned that France was willing to 
<br>support the training of additional troops for the TFG. 
<br> 
<br>¶18. (C) Kouchner argued that strengthening the European pillar in NATO 
<br>was necessary: the EU cannot exist without defense, the U.S. needs 
<br>strong European Allies, and a strong European pillar was not in 
<br>contradiction with NATO.  SecDef replied that during his time as 
<br>SecDef, he has felt the need for a better way for EU and NATO to work 
<br>together.  While NATO is primarily a security alliance, it can't do its 
<br>job without a civilian component.  The EU is primarily a 
<br>political-economic organization, but he was willing to acknowledge that 
<br>it had some security role -- such as counterpiracy or peacekeeping in 
<br>Chad.  SecDef said that while each organization might have its primary 
<br>role and mission, they could both perform both functions. 
<br> 
<br>¶19. (C) Interpreting SecDef's latter comment as prohibiting an EU 
<br>security role, Kouchner dissented and said that since 500 million 
<br>people live in the European Union, the EU needed to be able to 
<br>adequately protect them.  Gates observed that France was just one of 5 
<br>or 6 nations that spent more than 2 percent of GDP on defense, and that 
<br>if the EU decided it needed an independent security role, it could 
<br>reduce number of forces available to NATO and cripple the Alliance. 
<br>Even now, NATO had insufficient resources. Kouchner said that we needed 
<br>to share burdens among all nations, and that it was hard to make people 
<br>spend more on defense in the midst of an economic crisis. 
<br>
