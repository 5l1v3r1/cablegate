<br>
<br>REF: 07 ALGIERS 1069 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Robert S. Ford; reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) SUMMARY: In February 26 and 27 meetings with NEA 
<br>Assistant Secretary C. David Welch, President Abdelaziz 
<br>Bouteflika and Prime Minister Abdelaziz Belkhadem emphasized 
<br>their familiar line on self-determination for Western Sahara, 
<br>as well as the need to find a way out that would allow 
<br>Algeria to "save face." Bouteflika said that relations with 
<br>Morocco were "brotherly" and that Western Sahara was the only 
<br>issue standing between them. Because the U.S. was unburdened 
<br>by the colonial past of France in the region, Bouteflika felt 
<br>it was ideally placed to serve as an informal referee in 
<br>resolving the dispute. Although he said he understood 
<br>Morocco felt threatened by the prospect of Western Saharan 
<br>independence, Bouteflika said that Morocco only had itself to 
<br>blame for the current situation, as it had proceeded in a 
<br>"clumsy" manner. With a more "elegant" touch, he said, 
<br>Morocco could have encouraged "a Puerto Rico" outcome, where 
<br>Sahrawis would happily choose to remain a part of Morocco in 
<br>some form. Welch underlined to the Algerian officials that 
<br>the U.S. sought a practical approach that could help the 
<br>current negotiations make progress, and the Moroccan autonomy 
<br>proposal offered such a possibility. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>LOVE FOR BAKER PLAN DIES HARD 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) In response to A/S Welch's assertion that the Moroccan 
<br>plan served to move a frozen situation forward in the absence 
<br>of any alternative, Bouteflika asserted that the plan of 
<br>former Secretary of State James Baker was such an 
<br>alternative. He told A/S Welch that if another option was 
<br>necessary, "self-determination is that alternative" and the 
<br>Baker Plan should be discussed. A/S Welch replied that the 
<br>Baker plan is dead because it, too, failed to generate 
<br>progress. In Bouteflika's view, Baker failed because it was 
<br>not given a chance, and he blamed the U.S. for "not taking 
<br>its UN Security Council responsibilities seriously." 
<br>Bouteflika said the Moroccan plan offered less autonomy for 
<br>Western Sahara than an Algerian province currently enjoys 
<br>(reftel). He conceded that Algeria does have influence in 
<br>Western Sahara, but swore he would not use it to violate what 
<br>he sees as international law. 
<br>
<br>MOROCCAN "CLUMSINESS" TO BLAME 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) Prime Minister Abdelaziz Belkhadem told A/S Welch on 
<br>February 26 that the stability of Morocco was in Algeria's 
<br>interest, and that attempting "to transform an anti-colonial 
<br>issue" was not the right path to take and was potentially 
<br>destabilizing to the region. Bouteflika, meanwhile, said 
<br>that he understood Morocco felt threatened by the prospect of 
<br>independence for Western Sahara, but stressed that the 
<br>Moroccans only had themselves to blame for current Sahrawi 
<br>determination. Bouteflika explained, saying that Morocco 
<br>could have easily used a more "elegant" approach to produce a 
<br>Western Sahara independence that could be controlled or 
<br>supervised. Instead, he said, "they want Anschluss like 
<br>Saddam Hussein with Kuwait." Bouteflika said he easily could 
<br>have imagined an outcome in which Western Sahara chose to 
<br>remain a part of Morocco after seeing the benefits of 
<br>Moroccan rule, in much the same way "as Puerto Rico chose to 
<br>remain part of the U.S." According to Bouteflika, Morocco 
<br>needs to offer the Polisario something, since "you cannot ask 
<br>concessions from people who have nothing in their pockets." 
<br>Had it not been for Morocco's "clumsy" approach, Bouteflika 
<br>said "they could have gotten what they wanted." 
<br>
<br>ON FRANCE AND U.S. 
<br>------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) Burdened by its colonial history in the Maghreb, 
<br>France is unable to play a constructive role in resolving the 
<br>Western Sahara dispute, according to Bouteflika. France "has 
<br>never really accepted Algerian independence," Bouteflika 
<br>said, and he claimed that France was trying to settle scores 
<br>with Algeria by interfering in Western Sahara in support of 
<br>Morocco. In contrast, Bouteflika said the U.S. was an ideal 
<br>counterweight to balance Morocco, as none of the parties 
<br>
<br>ALGIERS 00000261 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>involved had any bone of contention with the U.S. Bouteflika 
<br>complained that the U.S. treats Algeria as "second class" 
<br>compared to the preferential treatment it gives to Tunisia 
<br>and Morocco. He said the U.S. should understand Algeria 
<br>better, as "you also paid a price for your independence." 
<br>Belkhadem told A/S Welch of Algeria's admiration for U.S. 
<br>positions on the independence of East Timor and Kosovo. "Why 
<br>don't you share the same views on Western Sahara?" asked 
<br>Belkhadem, "it leaves us wondering what our U.S. friends 
<br>want." With both Algerians, A/S Welch underlined that the 
<br>U.S. sought practical approaches that would advance the 
<br>Western Sahara negotiations forward. The Moroccan proposal, 
<br>he noted, offered a possibility. He urged the Algerians to 
<br>consider what they could do to help the current negotiations 
<br>make concrete progress. 
<br>
<br>COMMENT: NEED TO SAVE FACE 
<br>-------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) Bouteflika repeated to A/S Welch several times the 
<br>need for Algeria to get itself out of the Western Sahara 
<br>dispute in a way that allowed it to "save face." He 
<br>reiterated that Algeria "has no claim" at stake, and spoke of 
<br>looking towards positive future relations with Morocco, as 
<br>"one day we will need to get beyond this." In a February 27 
<br>meeting with Foreign Minister Mourad Medelci, A/S Welch 
<br>invited the Algerian delegation to visit Washington 
<br>immediately following the next round of negotiations at 
<br>Manhasset, to continue the discussions. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (U) This cable has not been cleared by A/S Welch.
