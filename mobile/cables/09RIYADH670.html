<br>ASSISTANT INTERIOR MINISTER PRINCE MOHAMMED BIN NAYEF 
<br>
<br>Classified By: CDA DAVID RUNDELL, 1.4(b),(d) 
<br>
<br>¶1. KEY POINTS: 
<br>
<br>-- (C) Ambassador Richard Holbrooke met in Riyadh May 16 with 
<br>HRH Prince Mohammed bin Nayef (MbN), Saudi Assistant Minister 
<br>of the Interior. 
<br>
<br>-- (C) Holbrooke emphasized that Afghanistan and Pakistan 
<br>should be treated as a closely inter-related problem. He 
<br>stressed U.S. desire for stronger cooperation and a common 
<br>U.S./Saudi approach to Pakistan based on economic assistance, 
<br>encouraging cooperation between Pakistani political factions, 
<br>and transforming the Pakistani army to fight a 
<br>counterinsurgency war. 
<br>
<br>-- (C) MbN noted the Saudis viewed the Pakistan army as the 
<br>strongest element for stability in the country. In reply 
<br>Holbrooke emphasized U.S. support for Pakistan's democracy 
<br>and said the U.S. opposed a military coup. MbN said he 
<br>agreed. 
<br>
<br>-- (C) MbN described Yemen as a dangerous failed state and a 
<br>growing threat to Saudi Arabia because it attracts Al-Qaeda 
<br>(AQ), said Yemeni President Saleh is losing control, and 
<br>outlined a Saudi strategy of co-opting Yemeni tribes with 
<br>assistance projects. 
<br>
<br>-- (C) MbN strongly supported President Obama's decision to 
<br>oppose release of photographs of U.S. detainee 
<br>interrogations, saying release would provide a boon to AQ, 
<br>and would be "the favor of their life." 
<br>
<br>PAKISTAN MUST NOT FAIL 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Holbrooke thanked the Prince for Saudi Arabia's $700 
<br>million pledge at the April 17 Pakistan donors' 
<br>conference in Japan. He said he had not come to make demands 
<br>or requests but simply to begin a consultative process. The 
<br>fact that three U.S. special envoys (Senator Mitchell, Dennis 
<br>Ross, and now Holbrooke) have visited Saudi Arabia 
<br>demonstrates the importance President Obama places on 
<br>U.S./Saudi relations and the Saudi role in the region. 
<br>Afghanistan and Pakistan were a major problem the new U.S. 
<br>administration had inherited. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Success in Afghanistan was essential for U.S. 
<br>security as well as security in Europe and the Middle East, 
<br>Holbrooke continued. The U.S. might be able to live with 
<br>some degree of instability in Afghanistan, but not with an 
<br>unstable Pakistan, because of Pakistan's nuclear arms, 
<br>fragile politics, and relationship with India. He asked if 
<br>Saudi Arabia shared this conclusion. MbN said "Absolutely," 
<br>a comment echoed precisely in Holbrooke's subsequent meetings 
<br>with King Abdullah and Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal 
<br>(septels). It's clear that Saudi Arabia has a "unique" 
<br>relationship with Pakistan, Holbrooke said. He noted that 
<br>over 800,000 Pakistanis live and work in Saudi Arabia. Saudi 
<br>Arabia was especially important to Nawaz Sharif, the most 
<br>popular politician in Pakistan. These were reasons why what 
<br>happened in Pakistan was of direct concern to both the U.S. 
<br>and Saudi Arabia. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Holbrooke said the U.S. and Saudi Arabia shared a 
<br>common purpose on Pakistan but not yet a "common 
<br>collaboration." The purpose of his visit was thus to begin a 
<br>dialogue on Pakistan and seek a common policy. Neither the 
<br>U.S. nor Saudi Arabia could afford to let Pakistan fall 
<br>apart. There were three important issues to address: 
<br>
<br>-- Pakistan desperately needs economic assistance; 
<br>-- Even though the Saudis preferred Nawaz Sharif, Sharif and 
<br>Zardari need to be persuaded to work together; 
<br>-- The Pakistan army needs to restructure itself to fight 
<br>today's war against the Taliban rather than yesterday's war 
<br>against India. 
<br>
<br>If Pakistan fell apart, Holbrooke said, the consequences for 
<br>Saudi Arabia would be "unimaginable," 
<br>especially if Pakistan's nuclear weapons fell into unfriendly 
<br>hands. ("God forbid!" interjected the Prince.) 
<br>"Under your leadership," Holbrooke told the Prince "Saudi 
<br>Arabia has defeated terror, but if Pakistan falls apart, the 
<br>result would be catastrophe." 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Holbrooke said the U.S. wanted to expand the 
<br>U.S./Saudi relationship concerning Pakistan. Saudi Arabia 
<br>could do a lot for Pakistan, he added, noting that economic 
<br>
<br>and social conditions in Pakistan created fertile ground for 
<br>extremism. Zardari had many faults but he was democratically 
<br>elected, so the U.S. tries to get him and Sharif to work 
<br>together. Meanwhile, Holbrooke said, money for the Taliban 
<br>flows in from the region. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) MbN said a vacuum in Islamabad would be dangerous. 
<br>He described Pakistan army Chief of Staff General Kayani as a 
<br>"decent man" who wanted to restore dignity to the army, and 
<br>sought consensus support of all the civilian factions. The 
<br>army was the Saudis' "winning horse," MbN said, but it needed 
<br>to prepare to fight the current war against terror. 
<br>Pakistani soldiers needed to be proud of their service, and 
<br>not hide their identity as soldiers when they were off duty, 
<br>MbN said. He had told Kayani that Pakistani troops needed to 
<br>feel they were fighting for Pakistan and not the U.S. The 
<br>Pakistani army had a "golden opportunity" because now 
<br>Pakistan faced an external enemy. MbN emphasized that the 
<br>army was Pakistan's "best bet" for stability. There were 
<br>800,000 Pakistanis and over one million Indians living in 
<br>Saudi Arabia, MbN said, and millions more visited the 
<br>Kingdom to make the Hajj pilgrimage, so anything that 
<br>happened in Pakistan, or between Pakistan and India, was a 
<br>threat to stability in Saudi Arabia. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Holbrooke said he knew Kayani, with the Director of 
<br>Pakistan's intelligence service (ISI), and 
<br>General Pasha, and also Musharraf. He recalled the U.S. and 
<br>Saudi Arabia had decided to support Musharraf in 
<br>the aftermath of 9/11. This had been the right decision at 
<br>the time but Musharraf had been a disappointment. The U.S. 
<br>supported democracy in Pakistan, not any individual leader. 
<br>Holbrooke repeated that the U.S. supported Zardari because he 
<br>was elected, and emphasized that the U.S. was "100 percent 
<br>opposed" to a military coup in Pakistan. MbN assured that 
<br>Saudi Arabia would not support a coup either. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) He noted the U.S. agreed that corruption in Pakistan 
<br>was an issue, but the U.S. had decided it was more 
<br>important to help Pakistan. Attaching onerous conditions to 
<br>assistance was a mistake, Holbrooke said. Since the U.S. and 
<br>Saudi Arabia agreed on Pakistan's importance, the question 
<br>was how to start working together. MbN answered that 
<br>U.S./Saudi security cooperation should stay as it is, since 
<br>it had "never been better" despite past tensions. Each side 
<br>knew its own business best, and the focus should be on 
<br>obtaining results. MbN characterized Saudi cooperation with 
<br>U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies as "one team." 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Holbrooke reiterated that terrorists in Pakistan were 
<br>not under enough pressure and pressed the point that 
<br>U.S./Saudi cooperation on Pakistan needed to rise to a higher 
<br>level. MbN replied that he had asked King Abdullah 
<br>for permission to maintain a "security channel" with the U.S. 
<br>to remain open at all times to facilitate information 
<br>exchange regardless of other issues in bilateral relations. 
<br>The Prince added that the King despised the corruption he saw 
<br>in Pakistan and this colored his views toward that country. 
<br>
<br>"WE HAVE A PROBLEM CALLED YEMEN" 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Moving to a new subject, the Prince said "We have a 
<br>problem called Yemen." AQ has found fertile ground 
<br>there, he said. The geography was similar to Afghanistan, 
<br>and many Yemenis were more sympathetic to AQ's goals than 
<br>were the Afghans. Yemen is also closer to AQ targets and 
<br>recruiting grounds in Saudi Arabia. The Saudis had detected 
<br>a pattern of individuals coming to the Kingdom for Hajj or 
<br>Umrah and then traveling south to Yemen ("it's only 400 
<br>miles," he noted) for training before returning to their home 
<br>countries. Saudi forces have arrested Egyptians and 
<br>Algerians, among others, who were attempting to do this. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) MbN described Yemen as a failed state that is "very, 
<br>very, extremely dangerous," and required focus. The Huthi 
<br>tribes were Takfiri and Shi'a "like Hizballah South," he 
<br>said. This was a threat forming around Saudi Arabia that 
<br>required action now. The Saudis would like Saleh to be a 
<br>strong leader, MbN said, but "his vision of Yemen has shrunk 
<br>to Sana'a," and he was losing control over the rest of the 
<br>country. Saleh's old advisors were gone and now he relied on 
<br>his son and other younger men who did not have good 
<br>connections with the Yemeni tribes. In contrast, Saudi 
<br>Arabia had good connections with the tribes, MbN said. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) MbN said the Saudis had established a bilateral 
<br>council with Yemen that met twice a year to consider 
<br>assistance projects. The Saudi representatives were the 
<br>
<br>
<br>Crown prince and the oil minister (Note: Crown Prince 
<br>Sultan has been incapacitated by illness for at least he past 
<br>year; it is not clear whether the bilateral council 
<br>has continued to meet in his absence.) Saudi assistance to 
<br>Yemen was not in the form of cash payments, MbN said, since 
<br>cash tended to end up in Swiss banks. Instead the Saudis 
<br>backed projects in the tribal areas of Yemen where AQ was 
<br>hiding. The idea was that when Yemenis saw the concrete 
<br>benefits of these projects they would push their leaders to 
<br>eject the extremists. Saudi Arabia was counting on this 
<br>strategy, MbN said, to persuade Yemenis to see extremists as 
<br>criminals rather than heroes. Holbrooke replied that the 
<br>U.S. understood Saudi concerns about Yemen, and would work 
<br>with the Saudis to address the problem there. 
<br>
<br>TERRORISTS STOLE OUR FAITH 
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Turning to another issue, MbN recalled that the day 
<br>following President Obama's inauguration, White House 
<br>counterterrorism advisor Brennan had telephoned to assure him 
<br>the new president was committed to continuing the war on 
<br>terror. "Terrorists stole the most valuable things we have," 
<br>said the Prince. "They took our faith and our children and 
<br>used them to attack us." It had not been easy to see Saudi 
<br>involvement in 9/11 and other terrorist incidents, he said. 
<br>AQ was smart in wanting to hit both the U.S. and Saudi 
<br>Arabia. AQ's strategic goal was to hurt the U.S. and to take 
<br>control of the Holy Cities of Mecca and Medina. 
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) MbN claimed that in 2003 radicals were present in 
<br>"90 percent" of Saudi mosques. The current Saudi leadership 
<br>had decided it needed to be on the front lines of the 
<br>struggle against terrorism, that the task could not be left 
<br>to the next generation, since AQ gained momentum every time 
<br>it succeeded. The Saudis realized they could not fight back 
<br>without public support, he said, and developed a strategy of 
<br>working with families of suicide bombers and other extremists 
<br>who had been killed. This approach involved providing 
<br>support to the families and telling them their sons had been 
<br>"victims" and not "criminals." This gave the families "a way 
<br>out" and 
<br>provided a public relations advantage to the government. "If 
<br>you stop five but create fifty" new radicals, "that's dumb." 
<br>MbN said. The Saudis measure their success against extremism 
<br>by looking at levels of terrorist recruitment the number of 
<br>successful operations, and they see a growing rejection of 
<br>extremist violence. The Prince related an anecdote about an 
<br>anti-terrorist operation in which the officer commanding 
<br>Interior Ministry forces had discovered his cousin was the 
<br>leader of the terrorists inside a surrounded building. MbN 
<br>said he had offered to relieve the officer, but the latter 
<br>had refused, and had insisted on leading the attack. The 
<br>officer succeeded in defeating the terrorists while capturing 
<br>his cousin alive. 
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) Saudi Arabia was not yet free of terrorism, MbN 
<br>said. Thus it remained important to defeat the terrorists on 
<br>the ground, in the media, and ideologically. The Saudis 
<br>wanted to do this in cooperation with the U.S., the Prince 
<br>said. Time was the key, and it was "not in our favor," he 
<br>added, so "we need to work fast." 
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) On terrorist financing, MbN said "We are trying to 
<br>do our best." Saudi Arabia has millions of visitors, 
<br>especially during Hajj. The Saudis are making arrests, but 
<br>are not making this public. Instead, the Saudi goal is to 
<br>make the public aware that donations could go to the wrong 
<br>places. MbN said that "if money wants to go" to terrorist 
<br>causes, "it will go," and that terrorist attacks were 
<br>inexpensive, "but let's make it harder." Holbrooke asked 
<br>what the Saudis would do with Pakistanis in Saudi Arabia who 
<br>financed terrorism. The Prince replied the suspects would be 
<br>tried in Shari'a courts with Wahhabi judges so that the 
<br>results of the judicial process could be used to condemn 
<br>extremist ideology. 
<br>
<br>A BIG FAVOR TO AL-QAEDA 
<br>
<br>¶17. (C) Holbrooke explained that President Obama had decided 
<br>to oppose release of 2000 photographs of U.S. 
<br>interrogations of terrorist suspects on grounds of national 
<br>security, and asked what the Saudi public reaction would be 
<br>to publication of these photos. MbN responded "You bet!" it 
<br>would be bad for security, and noted that following 
<br>publication of the first Abu Ghraib photos, Saudi authorities 
<br>had arrested 250 individuals trying to leave Saudi Arabia to 
<br>join extremist groups in Afghanistan. Release of more 
<br>pictures would give AQ "the favor of their life," said the 
<br>
<br>Prince. Saudi Arabia had fought very hard to defeat AQ on 
<br>the Internet, but he couldn,t see how to fight 2000 new 
<br>photos.
