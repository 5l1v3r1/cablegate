<br>
<br>-------
<br>Summary
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) Interior Minister Perez Yoma told the Ambassador
<br>February 6 that he is concerned about the potential
<br>radicalization of Chile's indigenous population, including
<br>funding from foreign terrorist groups and/or Venezuela. The
<br>GOC would like to draw on U.S. experience in addressing
<br>indigenous issues. Perez Yoma said U.S.-Chile cooperation on
<br>security matters is excellent but would like his Ministry to
<br>serve as a central clearinghouse for coordination between the
<br>various USG and GOC agencies, including training and
<br>information sharing. End summary.
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) Ambassador Simons paid a courtesy call February 6 on
<br>new Minister of Interior Edmundo Perez Yoma, who took office
<br>January 6, as part of President Bachelet's third cabinet
<br>change (ref C). The Ambassador was accompanied by E/Pol
<br>Counselor, RAO Chief, Legatt, and Acting DEA Chief.
<br>
<br>-------------
<br>I'm In Charge
<br>-------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) After exchange of pleasantries - Perez Yoma was
<br>curious about the previous day's U.S. "Super Tuesday"
<br>electoral results and appreciated the Ambassador's readout -
<br>the Minister agreed with Ambassador's assessment that the
<br>bilateral security relationship is excellent. He preferred,
<br>however, to have his Ministry "more fully informed"
<br>concerning the nature and scope of programs offered to
<br>Chilean police and security organs by individual USG
<br>agencies. Perez Yoma stressed he did not seek to impede
<br>direct contacts between USG agencies and the national police
<br>(Carabineros) or investigative police (Policia de
<br>Investigaciones de Chile), both of which fall under
<br>Interior's operative and administrative control, but that top
<br>levels of Interior should be apprised to better ensure GOC
<br>coordination. The Carabineros, for example, will sometimes
<br>"act independently," Perez Yoma said, implying that if
<br>Interior has a global view of USG programming with the
<br>Carabineros and other GOC security organs, he would be better
<br>able to ensure all are working from the same page. He
<br>suggested he and the Ambassador talk regularly; "our
<br>objectives are 100 percent the same as yours." The
<br>Ambassador agreed, adding that USG training programs,
<br>coordination with GOC security organs, and sharing of
<br>information are both effective and purposefully low-key.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------
<br>Indigenous Radicals Funded Externally?
<br>--------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) As had Secretariat General of the Presidency Minister
<br>Viera-Gallo the week before (ref A), Perez Yoma raised with
<br>the Ambassador GOC concern with the "Mapuche issue," Chile's
<br>largest indigenous group and one that has over the past
<br>several months seemingly taken a turn to radical and
<br>sometimes violent action (ref B). While intelligence is
<br>unclear, funding of the Mapuche by the FARC "and Chavez" is
<br>possible although, he noted, he wasn't sure some of the
<br>monies aren't being funneled off to other activities since
<br>Mapuche radicals remain "weak and disorganized." Potential
<br>Mapuche ties to ETA are also possible. "I would like," he
<br>said, "your help in following the money." RAO Chief noted
<br>his agency is working with Chilean colleagues to identify
<br>FARC and ETA actors outside Chile who might have potential
<br>links to Mapuche radicals. Legatt added that the FBI is
<br>
<br>
<br>coordinating with the Carabineros to assist in identification
<br>and potential prosecution of actors within Chile.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Perez Yoma said he would appreciate drawing on the
<br>broader experience of USG experts on indigenous issues.
<br>E/Pol Counselor replied the Embassy is currently coordinating
<br>internally on how to best provide assistance to the GOC.
<br>Besides intelligence sharing, we are considering how to use
<br>public diplomacy assets. The U.S. has experience at both
<br>national and state levels on the integration of indigenous
<br>peoples into the broader U.S. society. We want to identify
<br>and share with the GOC what has and hasn't worked for us.
<br>Perez Yoma suggested the Embassy work closely with Deputy
<br>Secretary Felipe Harboe on this issue. (Note: Embassy has
<br>
<br>SIPDIS
<br>an excellent working relationship with Harboe on other law
<br>enforcement issues.)
<br>
<br>-------
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Perez Yoma was reportedly brought on as seasoned
<br>political operator intended to bring discipline and focus to
<br>Bachelet's sometimes unruly administration. As Interior
<br>Minister he directs cabinet meetings when Bachelet is not
<br>present; press reports suggest he used his first meeting to
<br>hammer home the message he is in charge. He was all business
<br>in this initial call and very clearly concerned that the
<br>Mapuche issue has the potential to underscore Bachelet's
<br>perceived weakness on public security, an issue that falls
<br>squarely within his bailiwick. End comment.
