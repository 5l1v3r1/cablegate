<br> 
<br>SUMMARY 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C/NF) This is not a "change" election.  The German public 
<br>does not see the September 27 parliamentary elections as 
<br>decisive, and on many foreign policy fronts, including 
<br>Afghanistan, arms control, and Russia, we do not foresee 
<br>significant or distinct policy differences between the two 
<br>most feasible coalition options.  The most likely results of 
<br>the elections are a CDU/CSU-FDP (black-yellow) coalition or a 
<br>continued CDU/CSU-SPD Grand Coalition.  However, in some 
<br>areas there may be changes, including on Iran, tax policy, 
<br>and nuclear energy.  More importantly, there may be a new 
<br>foreign minister who will likely need to get up to speed 
<br>quickly on such crucial issues as Iran, Afghanistan, and 
<br>NATO's strategic posture.  Leaders from the CDU/CSU and FDP 
<br>promise a government more friendly toward the United States. 
<br>The near certainty that Angela Merkel will remain chancellor 
<br>argues for this, but the unpredictability of Foreign 
<br>Minister-aspirant and FDP Chairman Guido Westerwelle may call 
<br>for focused diplomatic engagement with the new FDP political 
<br>actors (see REFTEL E for Post's comprehensive expose of 
<br>Westerwelle).  END SUMMARY. 
<br> 
<br>BLACK-YELLOW (CDU/CSU-FDP)? 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (C/NF) It is virtually certain that Angela Merkel will 
<br>retain her position as Chancellor after this Sunday's 
<br>elections.  But it is impossible to predict the final 
<br>composition of the next coalition given that about a third of 
<br>the electorate is still undecided and the polls show only a 
<br>narrow parliamentary majority for black-yellow.  Chancellor 
<br>Merkel has repeatedly voiced her preference for a 
<br>black-yellow coalition and has promised to form one even with 
<br>a one-vote parliamentary majority.  The FDP's Westerwelle has 
<br>echoed this sentiment as its first choice as well. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C/NF) The SPD has almost no prospect of leading a 
<br>government and is only likely to remain in power as a 
<br>weakened junior partner in another Grand Coalition, should 
<br>the CDU/CSU-FDP come up short of a parliamentary majority. 
<br>The SPD has failed to gain much momentum, although it has 
<br>more recently risen a couple of points in the polls.  It 
<br>continues to suffer from an inability to profile itself 
<br>against the CDU (or even a lack of desire to break with the 
<br>CDU in any significant way), with which it has been in 
<br>government for the past four years.  Also unhelpful have been 
<br>a string of losses in local, state, and the June European 
<br>Parliament elections. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (C/NF) U.S. interests will not only be affected by the 
<br>composition of the next coalition but also which parties are 
<br>in the opposition.  A CDU/CSU-FDP coalition would bring to 
<br>power a new set of top players at the Ministry of Foreign 
<br>Affairs, Justice, Environment, and at either Economics or 
<br>Finance (as well as probably at least one other FDP-led 
<br>ministry with some turnover in CDU/CSU ministries as well). 
<br>The extent to which policy will change is less obvious, 
<br>however, because FDP Chairman and Foreign Minister aspirant 
<br>Guido Westerwelle has promised considerable continuity with 
<br>Steinmeier's approach to foreign policy.  In addition, the 
<br>FDP's economic reform goals will face considerable resistance 
<br>from the Bavarian CSU as well as parts of the CDU.  The lack 
<br>of coordination and consistency, including between the 
<br>Chancellery and MFA, that often occurs in German policy 
<br>making will continue to be a challenge for the United States. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (C/NF) A black-yellow coalition will face a more united 
<br>opposition led by an SPD that is likely to move left if it 
<br>leaves government and seeks to profile itself against the 
<br>Greens and the Left Party, based on the profiles of SPD 
<br>leaders waiting in the wings for Steinmeier and SPD Chairman 
<br> 
<br>BERLIN 00001176  002 OF 006 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Franz Muentefering to leave.  German governments can operate 
<br>with narrow majorities due to strict party discipline (which 
<br>gets stricter the narrower the majority), but Merkel has not 
<br>shown much courage in using her considerable personal 
<br>popularity to push through policies that lack public support. 
<br> On Afghanistan, in particular, a black-yellow coalition may 
<br>seek to simply roll over the ISAF mandate unchanged when it 
<br>comes up for renewal in December, rather than risk a row in 
<br>the Bundestag over an increase in the troop ceiling, which 
<br>the Defense Ministry has concluded is necessary to deal with 
<br>the growing insurgency in the German north. 
<br> 
<br>OR GRAND COALITION (CDU/CSU-SPD)? 
<br>--------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (C/NF) However, another Grand Coalition cannot be 
<br>discounted, even though nobody professes to want it.  It is a 
<br>historical fact that the center-right parties have not won a 
<br>parliamentary majority since 1994.  Another Grand Coalition 
<br>would almost certainly be even more difficult for the CDU/CSU 
<br>and the SPD than the current one since both parties would be 
<br>eyeing each other with distrust and the expectation that the 
<br>government may not last an entire term.  Further, Merkel's 
<br>position within her party would be weakened by what would be 
<br>viewed as her failure to achieve a coalition with the FDP 
<br>while the Free Democrats would continue to take advantage of 
<br>conservative dissatisfaction with the Grand Coalition's 
<br>disgruntled CDU voters. 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (C/NF) The SPD leadership might be secretly relieved not 
<br>to lose their government posts, but its continued partnership 
<br>with the CDU/CSU would likely cause further bleeding of the 
<br>party's more leftist supporters to the Greens and Left Party, 
<br>further weakening its base.  In addition, the SPD left-right 
<br>split might be exacerbated, with leftists tempted to 
<br>prematurely rupture the Grand Coalition to build a majority 
<br>red-red-green government where the SPD would hold the 
<br>chancellorship.  CDU officials certainly believe -- and have 
<br>told the Embassy -- that they expect the SPD would seek to 
<br>replace a Grand Coalition with a red-red-green one some time 
<br>during the term.  Even though Steinmeier has insisted that 
<br>any coalition agreement would be for the entire legislative 
<br>period, the distrust between the parties would remain.  Plus, 
<br>if the SPD performs badly in the election, Steinmeier 
<br>literally may no longer be in a position to keep his word. 
<br> 
<br>GERMANY'S NEXT FOREIGN MINISTER - WESTERWELLE OR STEINMEIER? 
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (C/NF) The election's most obvious impact on bilateral 
<br>relations will be in terms of a potential change in foreign 
<br>ministers.  Our extensive experience with Steinmeier allows 
<br>us to comfortably predict how a Steinmeier-led MFA would 
<br>pursue German interests globally, and vis-a-vis the United 
<br>States.  On the other hand, Westerwelle continues to remain 
<br>an enigma who has been unable to establish himself as a 
<br>significant voice on foreign affairs.  The FDP's foreign 
<br>policy spokesman Werner Hoyer -- a well known foreign policy 
<br>analyst in Germany and internationally, including in the 
<br>United States -- has taken the lead here.  When we asked 
<br>Hoyer this week what would change with Westerwelle, he 
<br>struggled to say anything.  Westerwelle is a domestic 
<br>political animal with little appetite for foreign policy and 
<br>international affairs.  He will, therefore, continue to be 
<br>dependent for foreign policy advice on his mentor, former 
<br>Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher as well as on Hoyer 
<br>and whichever Ministry diplomats gain his trust (REFTEL E). 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (C/NF) Westerwelle's attempt to position himself among 
<br>Germany's foreign policy elite with a speech in May at the 
<br>German Foreign Relations Council (DGAP) did not produce the 
<br>intended results and instead revealed his limitations on such 
<br>major issues as Middle East peace.  If Westerwelle becomes 
<br>Germany's next foreign minister, his learning curve will be 
<br>steep.  Germany's small foreign and security policy elite -- 
<br>already skeptical of Westerwelle -- will resent his rise into 
<br>the second most powerful political office of the land.  And 
<br>we will be faced with the question of how best to approach 
<br>someone who has clearly had a mixed relationship with the 
<br>United States.  Despite Westerwelle's praise and respect for 
<br>the current Obama Administration, we should not forget that, 
<br>as part of the opposition, he has criticized the United 
<br>States for the last eight years, while at the same time 
<br> 
<br>BERLIN 00001176  003 OF 006 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>offering very few ideas of his own on how to solve 
<br>international problems (see REFTEL E). 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (C/NF) If Steinmeier is able to lead the SPD to a strong 
<br>enough showing to force a Grand Coalition, he certainly could 
<br>maintain his position as Foreign Minister.  He would also 
<br>have the increased political clout provided by a mandate in 
<br>the Bundestag and his success in blocking a CDU/CSU-FDP 
<br>coalition.  Obviously, there would be a high degree of 
<br>foreign policy continuity.  Unlike Westerwelle, Steinmeier is 
<br>already on board with both sides of the U.S. approach to 
<br>Iran, and he has told the Ambassador that he supports 
<br>additional sanctions should Tehran fail to respond to U.S. 
<br>overtures.  However, competition between Steinmeier and 
<br>Merkel over control of foreign policy will not end with the 
<br>election, and Steinmeier would likely try to focus on a few 
<br>key issues where he could differentiate himself and his party 
<br>from Merkel and the CDU, with arms control, Afghanistan, and 
<br>Russian relations being likely choices.  Steinmeier wants to 
<br>work closely with Washington on these issues and is less 
<br>likely to surprise Washington than the Chancellery would be. 
<br> 
<br>¶11.  (C/NF) The goodwill that marked the first year of the 
<br>Grand Coalition is unlikely to be repeated in a second term, 
<br>particularly as Steinmeier contends with those in his own 
<br>party who would prefer a leftist coalition.  If there is not 
<br>enough support for a CDU/CSU-FDP coalition, then there would 
<br>likely be a numerical red-red-green majority in the 
<br>Bundestag.  The strained communication that currently marks 
<br>Chancellery-MFA relations is likely to continue.  Both 
<br>Steinmeier and Merkel are responsible realists, however, who 
<br>understand the need to work together on the big issues, as 
<br>was evident during the Russian invasion of Georgia, their 
<br>approach to the Middle East, and their reaction to the 
<br>international financial melt down.  If new crises arise, the 
<br>two are likely to continue to put their own interests aside 
<br>long enough to speak with a single voice. 
<br> 
<br>FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES IN BLACK-YELLOW AND GRAND COALITIONS 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶12.  (C/NF) AFGHANISTAN (Some Change): Westerwelle is one of 
<br>the few German politicians who justifies the Afghanistan 
<br>deployment on the basis of "German national security 
<br>interests" and the FDP as a whole has been a consistent 
<br>supporter of the ISAF mandate.  But with only a narrow 
<br>majority in the Bundestag and facing an SPD opposition ready 
<br>to accuse them of militarizing the German mission, a 
<br>CDU-CSU/FDP coalition ironically might be less willing (and 
<br>able) to push through necessary troop increases than a Grand 
<br>Coalition.  On the other hand, there is likely to be no 
<br>difference between the two on the support for police 
<br>training, economic assistance and other civilian aid. 
<br> 
<br>¶13.  (SBU) ARMS CONTROL/NONPROLIFERATION (Little change): 
<br>Westerwelle proudly says that the motto of the MFA under his 
<br>leadership will be "peace through disarmament," thereby 
<br>seeking to be even more pro-arms control than Steinmeier. 
<br>Although Westerwelle has called for the removal of all U.S. 
<br>tactical nuclear weapons from German soil by 2013, it is 
<br>questionable whether he will manage to include this in a 
<br>coalition agreement with the CDU/CSU given their likely 
<br>resistance. 
<br> 
<br>¶14. (C/NF) RUSSIA (No change): Like the SPD, the FDP sees 
<br>Russia as a "strategic partner" in addressing issues such as 
<br>Iran, energy, and Afghanistan and believes engagement and 
<br>assistance with modernization is the best way to address 
<br>Russia's democratic deficits.  Like Merkel and Steinmeier, 
<br>Westerwelle has pursued close ties to Russian leaders, 
<br>including Foreign Minister Lavrov and Defense Minister 
<br>Ivanov, both of whom gave him high-profile meetings in Moscow 
<br>this past spring. 
<br> 
<br>¶15. (C/NF) IRAN (Some change): Steinmeier has been a steady 
<br>supporter of US policy toward Iran -- both in terms of 
<br>dialogue and the need for increased sanctions if necessary, 
<br>while Westerwelle has spoken almost exclusively about the 
<br>need for dialogue.  In addition, Westerwelle's FDP's 
<br>pro-business orientation makes it particularly skeptical of 
<br>sanctions and is also resistant to unilateral efforts to cut 
<br>back trade.  Merkel will likely have to take a stronger role 
<br>in this issue to keep Germany's position from falling back to 
<br> 
<br>BERLIN 00001176  004 OF 006 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>the least common denominator. 
<br> 
<br>¶16.  (C/NF) TURKEY (Some change): A black-yellow coalition 
<br>may result in a subtle, less favorable, shift in Germany's 
<br>policy towards Turkey with the exit of the SPD -- Turkey's 
<br>staunchest supporter -- from the government.  Although FDP 
<br>foreign policy experts recognize that EU membership is an 
<br>important factor in encouraging additional domestic reforms 
<br>in Turkey, it has kept an open mind on the issue.  However, 
<br>the FDP is more vocal than the SPD in its criticism of 
<br>Turkey. 
<br> 
<br>¶17.  (C/NF) MIDDLE EAST (Little change): Westerwelle's views 
<br>on Israel and Middle East peace may stem more from his past 
<br>experience in addressing criticism against Israel and his 
<br>interpretation of Germany's historical role toward Israel 
<br>than from his own Middle East policy or strategic 
<br>calculations.  Some attribute Westerwelle's current 
<br>pro-Israel stance as the result of his having been burned 
<br>politically both domestically and in Israel in 2002.  At that 
<br>time, Westerwelle defended an FDP politician, Juergen 
<br>Moellemann, who had published a brochure strongly critical of 
<br>then Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's actions towards 
<br>the Palestinians.  Some claimed the brochure was 
<br>anti-Semitic.  While in Israel shortly thereafter, 
<br>Westerwelle was questioned by then-PM Sharon about what 
<br>Sharon referred to as a growing anti-Semitism in Germany and 
<br>Europe.  In an August 2009 interview with "Der Spiegel," 
<br>Westerwelle explained his decision to vote against Germany's 
<br>participation in UNIFIL with his view that Germany cannot 
<br>take a neutral position in the Middle East because of its 
<br>past.  He noted that he had visited the Golan Heights in 
<br>Israel as a young man and was impressed with the 
<br>vulnerability of the country.  Even more so than Steinmeier, 
<br>however, Westerwelle may seek a greater role for Germany and 
<br>the EU in the Middle East.  In the "Spiegel" interview, he 
<br>called for the EU to launch an initiative to establish a 
<br>conference for security and cooperation in the Middle East. 
<br>We could expect both Steinmeier and Westerwelle to hold to 
<br>U.S. messages on the Middle East, with both competing with 
<br>the Chancellery for the lead on this issue. 
<br> 
<br>¶18. (C/NF) GUANTANAMO (No change): Steinmeier would likely 
<br>take a more accommodating approach toward Germany accepting 
<br>some of the Guantanamo detainees than would Westerwelle, but 
<br>the key ministry in deciding this issue will continue to be 
<br>Interior.  In either a black-yellow or another Grand 
<br>Coalition, Wolfgang Schaeuble (CDU) could continue on as 
<br>Interior Minister, although there is some talk of his being 
<br>named as EU commissioner.  Schaeuble has been very skeptical 
<br>of accepting detainees from a security standpoint.  More 
<br>recently, he told the Ambassador that Germany would only take 
<br>detainees who will require no surveillance. 
<br> 
<br>¶19. (SBU) ECONOMIC CRISIS/INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REGULATION 
<br>(Little Change): All potential government parties share a 
<br>similar strategy; increase regulation and supervision of the 
<br>financial sector with differences at the margin.  The SPD 
<br>advocates taxing share trades over 1000 euros and monitoring 
<br>private equity funds more closely, while the CDU/CSU and FDP 
<br>propose concentrating financial supervision under the 
<br>Bundesbank.  A black-yellow government would result in a new 
<br>Finance Minister; if Karl Theodor zu Guttenberg remains at 
<br>the Economics Ministry, then the FDP might be given the 
<br>Finance Minister, with Hans-Otto Solms, an experienced and 
<br>cautious financial policy expert, the most likely replacement. 
<br> 
<br>¶20. (C) CLIMATE CHANGE (No Change): There is little 
<br>difference between the parties on issues in play at the 
<br>upcoming UNFCCC's COP-15 in Copenhagen, and Merkel maintains 
<br>strong control over German policy in this area.  There will 
<br>be a new Environment Minister should a black-yellow 
<br>government be formed, however, and it is unclear which party 
<br>would then control the Ministry.  In previous CDU/CSU-FDP 
<br>coalitions, the CDU ran it but if the FDP does as well as 
<br>current polls suggest, it might make a play for the Ministry. 
<br> Current SPD Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel has had a 
<br>high profile in his party's Bundestag campaign and could 
<br>remain in place in a Grand Coalition. 
<br> 
<br>¶21. (C) ENERGY (Some Change): The SPD insisted on 
<br>continuation of the previous government's plan to phase out 
<br>nuclear power plants during the last coalition negotiations 
<br> 
<br>BERLIN 00001176  005 OF 006 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>and would stick to this position again.  In contrast, the FDP 
<br>has been the party most open to nuclear energy, insisting 
<br>that the phase-out itself should be at least slowed down to 
<br>protect Germany's supply of energy.  The CSU/CSU also wants 
<br>to extend the possible life of existing nuclear power plants, 
<br>provided they are safe, during a "transitional" period to 
<br>provide time for Germany to switch to greater reliance on 
<br>renewable sources.  Recent controversies over the safety of 
<br>some nuclear power plants have made Merkel and even the FDP 
<br>less willing to press for reliance on nuclear energy. 
<br> 
<br>¶22. (C/NF) DATA PROTECTION (Little Change): Data privacy has 
<br>been a second-tier campaign issue but does arise in debates 
<br>on domestic security policy.  Another Grand Coalition could 
<br>leave Justice Minister Brigitte Zypries (SPD) in place; she 
<br>reluctantly agreed to the landmark data sharing initiative on 
<br>serious crime and terrorism suspects (the Pruem-like 
<br>agreement) due to privacy concerns.  A CDU/CSU-FDP coalition 
<br>might return Sabine Leutheusser-Scharrenberger to the Justice 
<br>Ministry, which she headed from 1992-96 in the last 
<br>black-yellow coalition (she resigned her office after the her 
<br>party agreed to wiretapping legislation proposed by the 
<br>CDU/CSU).  She or any FDP Justice Minister would likely 
<br>continue to see their role as the protector of civil 
<br>liberties and therefore they would carefully scrutinize all 
<br>bilateral and U.S.-EU data sharing initiatives. 
<br> 
<br>¶23. (C/NF) COUNTER-TERRORISM/LAW ENFORCEMENT (Little change): 
<br>The CDU will likely remain in control of the Interior 
<br>Ministry regardless of the coalition, and Schaeuble, although 
<br>67, is likely but not certain to stay on for another term. 
<br>He has brought U.S.-German CT cooperation to an unprecedented 
<br>level, and no other German official has offered as much 
<br>cooperation (except on the issue of resettling Guantanamo 
<br>detainees where the focus on internal German security 
<br>supersedes his desire to work with Washington).  Any possible 
<br>replacement -- Chancellery Chief Thomas de Maiziere has been 
<br>mentioned in the press -- is unlikely to have his authority 
<br>or expertise but will likely continue his policies. 
<br> 
<br>¶24. (U) TRADE (No change): All five parties are committed to 
<br>open market but the SPD, Greens, and The Left Party want 
<br>environmental and social standards included while the CDU/CSU 
<br>stresses the need for protection of intellectual property and 
<br>the FDP worries about domestic subsidies and market access. 
<br>None of the parties wants to restructure the German economy 
<br>to reduce export-dependency and address global imbalances. 
<br>Other U.S. interests, such as concluding the Doha round of 
<br>trade negotiations, would not likely be affected by a change 
<br>in coalition. 
<br> 
<br>¶25. (U) TAX POLICY (Some change): Tax policy is often cited 
<br>as the area where a black-yellow government would produce 
<br>change.  The FDP proposes a radical overhaul of the tax 
<br>system to simplify the tax code and stagger the corporate 
<br>rate.  CSU leader and Bavaria Minister-President Horst 
<br>Seehofer has been critical of the FDP plan, which he says 
<br>will run up the deficit and impose an excessive burden on the 
<br>public budget.  Neither the CDU/CSU's nor FDP's tax proposals 
<br>are realistic, however, in light of budget deficits that are 
<br>expected to be more than 2 percent this year and 4 percent in 
<br>2010, just as mid-term targets for Germany's balanced budget 
<br>amendment kick in.  Some sort of tax increase therefore is a 
<br>near certainty, perhaps in the form of an increase in the 
<br>value-added tax. 
<br> 
<br>COMMENT 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶26. (C/NF) Chancellor Merkel will continue to exert strong 
<br>influence on German foreign policy in an attempt to create a 
<br>political legacy in international affairs.  This will be true 
<br>whether the MFA is led by Steinmeier or Westerwelle.  We can 
<br>also predict that tensions between the Chancellery and MFA 
<br>will remain based on different coalition partners controlling 
<br>them.  If Steinmeier returns to office, he will be a reliable 
<br>partner.  Westerwelle is a wild card; his exuberant 
<br>personality does not lend itself to taking a back seat to 
<br>Chancellor Merkel on any issue.  If he becomes foreign 
<br>minister, there is the possibility of higher profile discord 
<br>between the Chancellery and MFA.  This may demand focused 
<br>diplomatic engagement by the USG with the new FDP political 
<br>actors.  END COMMENT.
