<br>OPTIMISTIC ABOUT RUSSIAN JEWISH COMMUNITY
<br>
<br>REF: MOSCOW 02696 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador John Beyrle for reason 1.4 (d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: The Ambassador met separately with xxxxx during the week of September 15.
<br>xxxxx probed for potential U.S. sanctions against
<br>investors in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and flagged concern
<br>over Iran's nuclear program. Both xxxxx agreed that
<br>manifestations of anti-Semitism in Russia had fallen in
<br>recent years, but xxxxx attributed Putin's relatively
<br>pro-Jewish stance to his need to not appear anti-Semitic
<br>during his campaign against the oligarchs. Regarding the
<br>Jewish community, xxxxx praised the positive effects of
<br>Russia's explosion of wealth, while xxxxx linked economic
<br>expansion to a negative shift in the occupational and
<br>educational interests of the Russian Jewry. Both xxxxx
<br>added that immigration from Israel to Russia vastly exceeded
<br>Russian emigration to Israel, but xxxxx noted the
<br>reduced Israeli financial support because of the falling
<br>dollar. End Summary.
<br>
<br>Anti-Semitism: Muted Compared to Soviet Era
<br>-------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) xxxxx told the
<br>Ambassador on September 16 that anti-Semitism in Russia has
<br>declined in recent years, and that Russian Jews faced fewer
<br>problems today than in Soviet times. xxxxx noted that
<br>the chance for a reversal of fortune for Russian Jews
<br>existed, characterizing Russia as a country of extremes. He
<br>drew an analogy to Gorbachev's prohibition of alcohol and the
<br>Russian penchant to drink excessively as a manifestation of
<br>these extremes. xxxxx more cautiously agreed that
<br>anti-Semitism was not widespread -- especially in Russia's
<br>political sphere -- as it had been in past years. However, he
<br>attributed this change, in part, to Putin's conscious desire
<br>to appear unbiased in his campaign against Russia's
<br>predominately Jewish oligarchs. xxxxx added that
<br>economic prosperity brought tolerance and reduced the need
<br>for scapegoats, noting that Russia's newfound wealth softened
<br>a principal grievance of Russian society. He also applauded
<br>the Russian government's efforts to punish those that
<br>committed racially-motivated crimes, saying that the 16-year
<br>imprisonment of Aleksandr Koptsov for stabbing 11 people in a
<br>Moscow synagogue in 2006 left an indelible impression on
<br>society. xxxxx also explained the role of numerous
<br>Jewish organizations in Russia and Eastern Europe, referred
<br>specifically to the increasing prominence of the Russian
<br>Jewish community in Germany, and he said that Russian Jews
<br>wQl eventually assume leadership of the Jewish community
<br>there.
<br>
<br>
<br>Political Jockeying, Georgia, Iran
<br>----------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) xxxxx admitted that he did not have the same
<br>level of contact with the Kremlin as xxxxx, Chief
<br>Rabbi of Russia Berel Lazar (Note: Along with Chief Rabbi of
<br>Russia Berel Lazar, xxxxx Calling himself an old man, he claimed to have
<br>little interest in attending official functions, and he
<br>appreciated the fact that he was no longer "bothered" by the
<br>ruling elite. He singled out the Kremlin's disapproval of
<br>Russian oligarch Vladimir Gusinsky, xxxxx as the chief reason for his past and current
<br>political "suffering."
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) xxxxx in his meeting, probed for information
<br>about potential U.S. crackdowns against any oligarchs for
<br>investing in South Ossetia or Abkhazia, curious about the
<br>future funding for the Jewish community. He specifically
<br>mentioned diamond magnate Lev Leviev's rumored financial
<br>problems stemming from some bad investments, and added that
<br>the current financial crisis damaged the Russian elite.
<br>xxxxx expressed concern over Iran, noting to his recent
<br>travel to Brussels for the European Jewish Congress (EJC)
<br>annual meeting, chaired by EJC President and Russian
<br>billionaire Vyacheslav Moshe Kantor. Kantor called for
<br>strong, legal, multilateral measures against Iran for their
<br>development of a nuclear weapons program in a May 2008 press
<br>conference, then subsequently traveled to Tehran for
<br>meetings, according to xxxxx He spoke about Kantor's
<br>work on Holocaust issues, specifically drawing on Kantor's
<br>work with the government of Poland on the 65th anniversary of
<br>the liberation of Auschwitz, as well as his cooperation with
<br>the government of Ukraine in 2006 on remembering the 65th
<br>
<br>anniversary of the executions at Babi Yar. xxxxx
<br>estimated that Kantor had dedicated approximately 30-40
<br>million dollars to his work in Eastern Europe, but did not
<br>specifically say if Kantor drew on his own funds for this
<br>purpose.
<br>
<br>Jewish Community Relations
<br>--------------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) While xxxxx gave a mixed assessment on the future
<br>of Russia's Jewish community, xxxxx saw Russia's
<br>economic growth as positive for the Jewish middle class.
<br>While naming the Georgian and Azeri Jewish communities in
<br>Moscow as strong and calling the entire Jewish community more
<br>stable, xxxxx criticized the motivations of Russia's
<br>Jewish youth, saying they no longer strove for prestigious
<br>careers in science, teaching, or theology as in Soviet times.
<br>xxxxx placed importance on current youth projects,
<br>pointing to the need for a more robust Jewish upbringing in
<br>contemporary society considering that many young Jews pursued
<br>business careers. xxxxx on the other hand, saw
<br>Russia's newfound wealth as a positive factor for the Jewish
<br>community since it has enabled the formerly lower class
<br>citizens to reach a middle class status. Community members
<br>have earned the ability to buy cars and real estate, travel
<br>once a year, and even provide donations for community
<br>projects. He also relayed the fact that the Moscow Jewish
<br>community had taken control of its financial situation, no
<br>longer relying on help from abroad.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) While the number of Jews in Russia remained low, the
<br>community retained strong support. xxxxx could not give
<br>an exact number for Russia's Jewish population, estimating
<br>the community's number at 500,000 with only 1,500 Jews left
<br>in his birthplace of Birobidzhan, Jewish Autonomous District
<br>(Note: 2008 International Religious Freedom Report estimated
<br>Russia's Jewish population at 250,000). xxxxx blamed the
<br>decline of the Jewish Autonomous District on a lack of
<br>leadership. He tallied 112 Jewish communities in Russia and
<br>added that new synagogues had been built in Petrogorsk,
<br>Tomsk, Tula, and in the northern Caucasus. xxxxx told
<br>the Ambassador that the Congress of the Jewish Religious
<br>Organizations and Associations of Russia (KEROOR) had over
<br>100 communities in Russia, predominantly based in St.
<br>Petersburg, Moscow, and the Golden Ring outside of Moscow.
<br>Those communities outside of these three regions typically
<br>depended on financial support from Moscow.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) xxxxx for a
<br>Jewish museum failed to bear fruit. While Lazar's Museum of
<br>Tolerance (reftel) received high-level support from Putin and
<br>Luzhkov, his past efforts to create a non-denominational
<br>Jewish museum never took off. xxxxx saw the Museum of
<br>Tolerance as a Chabad project, one that will present Lazar's
<br>perception of Jewish history and culture and confirmed that
<br>Leviev financed Lazar's project, along with Roman Abramovich.
<br>
<br>
<br>Israel
<br>------
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) xxxxx indicated that Jewish immigration from
<br>Israel to Russia greatly exceeded that of emigration from
<br>Russia to Israel. xxxxx appeared impressed by the level
<br>of reverse immigration from Israel to Russia, saying that
<br>only approximately 1,000 Russians emigrated to Israel over
<br>the past year. xxxxx 
<br>impressions, saying that approximately 2,000 Jews in the
<br>entire former Soviet Union moved to Israel in the past year.
<br>Both regarded the figures as the product of Russia's growing
<br>stability and wealth. Adding greater depth on
<br>Russian-Israeli relations, xxxxx blamed the falling
<br>dollar for the reduction of Israeli support to the Russian
<br>Jewish educational system. xxxxx lauded the
<br>recently signed visa-free travel agreement between Russia and
<br>Israel since it would mean less work for him, no longer
<br>needing to help his community members receive visas.
