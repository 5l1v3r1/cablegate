<br>SUBJECT: CODEL GREGG'S DECEMBER 30 MEETING WITH PRESIDENT 
<br>ASAD 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: CDA Charles Hunter for reasons 1.4 b and d. 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (S) Summary:  In a frank one-hour meeting with Syrian 
<br>President Bashar al-Asad, Senators Gregg, Bayh, Specter, 
<br>Enzi, Cornyn, and Klobuchar affirmed Washington's interest in 
<br>better U.S.-Syrian relations and pushed Asad to take positive 
<br>steps as well.  The senators urged Syria to move forward on 
<br>security cooperation with the U.S. on Iraq, facilitating the 
<br>release of three detained Americans in Iran, and re-opening 
<br>the Damascus Community School.  Asad welcomed the prospect of 
<br>more Congressional visits and candid exchanges, saying 
<br>diplomacy had failed to solve the region's problems during 
<br>the last two decades. 
<br> 
<br>--  On comprehensive peace, Asad reiterated Syria's strong 
<br>desire to return to Turkish-facilitated indirect talks with 
<br>Israel as a means to establish agreed terms of reference for 
<br>direct negotiations.  Syria's relations with Iran should not 
<br>be linked to Israeli-Syrian peace negotiations.  Syria's ties 
<br>to Hamas, Hizballah, and other groups could be satisfactorily 
<br>resolved only after the achievement of a comprehensive 
<br>regional peace, Asad maintained. 
<br> 
<br>--  The U.S. and Syria should use the next several months to 
<br>improve bilateral relations so that both sides could overcome 
<br>mutual distrust that would hinder U.S. credibility as an 
<br>honest broker, Asad told the senators.  Later in the 
<br>discussion, FM Muallim argued the onus for taking the next 
<br>positive step lay with the U.S.  Syria could not move on 
<br>issues such as the American school or the Cultural Center 
<br>unless Washington lifted its ban on the sale of new 
<br>commercial aircraft to Syria. 
<br> 
<br>--   Calling Iran the region's most important country, Asad 
<br>said the West could improve the prospects for peace by 
<br>acknowledging Iran's NPT-protected right to enrich uranium 
<br>under IAEA monitoring.  Asad argued the West should accept 
<br>Iran's "reasonable" counter-offer to ship several batches of 
<br>low-enriched uranium (LEU) abroad for enrichment by other 
<br>countries, instead of insisting Iran ship all of its LEU at 
<br>once.  Asad said he believed Iran was not interested in 
<br>pursuing a nuclear weapon, but warned that an Israeli 
<br>military strike on Iran's nuclear infrastructure would fail 
<br>to disable the program and would only increase Iran's 
<br>determination.  End Summary. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -- 
<br>Doctor Asad:  Treat, Don't Condemn, the Illness 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -- 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (S)  A confident President Asad greeted the six visiting 
<br>senators and accompanying staff of CODEL Gregg on December 30 
<br>with a call for frank discussion of "the facts" rather than 
<br>an exchange of opinions.  Only the facts, he said, would 
<br>enable both sides to focus on the critical issues of common 
<br>interest and lead to a process of identifying solutions to 
<br>shared challenges.  The international community had failed 
<br>for two decades to solve the region's problems.  Now, there 
<br>were new challenges on top of these that required direct, not 
<br>diplomatic, solutions.  He welcomed the delegation, saying he 
<br>hoped for more meetings with Congressional groups. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (S) Senator Specter expressed the delegation's 
<br>condolences after the death of the President's younger 
<br>brother Majd and recalled his numerous meetings with 
<br>President Asad since their first meeting in 2000 at the 
<br>funeral of former Syrian President Hafez al-Asad.  Senator 
<br>Specter referred to his earlier discussions with Syrian 
<br>officials about Israeli-Syrian peace talks and suggested 
<br> 
<br>DAMASCUS 00000008  002 OF 006 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Israel would benefit from peace with Syria.  The U.S. 
<br>recognized Syria's deep and long-standing ties to Iran, but 
<br>it also saw dangers if Iran acquired nuclear weapons. 
<br>Stipulating that the Israeli government would have to make 
<br>its own decisions on how to proceed in peace talks with Syria 
<br>without U.S. pressure, Specter suggested the U.S. would 
<br>positively view Syrian efforts to use its influence to alter 
<br>Iranian policies.  Iranian policies currently opposed the 
<br>achievement of peace between Syria and Israel, even as Syria 
<br>recognized such a development would have a positive impact on 
<br>defusing other regional tensions. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (S)  Asad asserted he wanted peace with Israel, but the 
<br>issues were complex and required an organized frame of 
<br>reference.  Both sides might agree on the shared objective of 
<br>peace, but they differed on preferred approaches.  Calling 
<br>for a fact-based approach to identifying the obstacles to 
<br>peace, Asad likened the process to how a doctor should treat 
<br>cancer.  Condemnations and mutual recriminations might be 
<br>self-satisfying, but the cancer still grows unless the doctor 
<br>is able to treat the root illness.  Syria, Asad continued, 
<br>had begun indirect peace talks with Israel in May 2008 under 
<br>Turkish auspices.  In roughly eight months, these talks had 
<br>achieved more than several years of direct negotiations with 
<br>Israel in the 1990s.  The U.S. and Europeans needed to 
<br>support the Turkish track, argued Asad.  They also should 
<br>convince Israel that only peace will protect Israel. 
<br>Israel's military superiority would not secure it from attack 
<br>against missiles and other technologies.  President Obama's 
<br>tenure might represent the last opportunity for peace, Asad 
<br>told the senators. 
<br> 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br>Asad on Necessity of Indirect Peace Talks 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (S)  Senator Gregg asked why Syria insisted on pursuing 
<br>indirect peace talks via the Turks.  Why couldn't Syria and 
<br>Israel move to direct talks brokered by the U.S., while Syria 
<br>helped on issues important to the U.S., such as Hizballah, 
<br>Hamas, and relations with Iran?  Asad replied Hamas and 
<br>Hizballah should be a part of the peace, but not organizing 
<br>principles for conducting peace discussions.  Syria, as 
<br>demonstrated by then-lead negotiator Muallim's efforts in the 
<br>1990s, had no problems with direct negotiations.  But those 
<br>negotiations failed; failing again might foreclose future 
<br>opportunities.  U.S. ambitions to push the peace process 
<br>forward only resulted in spoiling the process because of the 
<br>lack of "rules of negotiation."  Indirect talks represent the 
<br>best way to establish terms of reference similar to those 
<br>reached by Secretary Baker during his intense shuttle 
<br>diplomacy in 1991.  While no one called these talks indirect 
<br>negotiations, they functioned comparably to Syria's indirect 
<br>talks under Turkish auspices. 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (S)  Syria, Asad continued, saw the indirect talks as a 
<br>way to institutionalize the process and reach agreed terms of 
<br>reference on which to base direct negotiations.  This basis 
<br>was absent in the 1990s and explained why the direct 
<br>negotiations ultimately failed.  Referring to the "elephant 
<br>in the room," Gregg asked whether it would be possible to 
<br>reach peace with Israel without first resolving the Iranian 
<br>nuclear issue.  Asad cautioned against linking Iran's nuclear 
<br>program to an Israeli-Syrian peace deal, arguing such a link 
<br>would only complicate both sets of issues.  "Too many cooks 
<br>spoil the meal," he said.  Later in the conversation, however 
<br>(in the context of a request for Syrian intervention with 
<br>Iran to free detained American hikers), Asad noted every 
<br>person and nation was key in bilateral and regional dynamics. 
<br> 
<br>DAMASCUS 00000008  003 OF 006 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> Syria had cut relations with the U.S. after the 1967 
<br>Arab-Israeli conflict, but bilateral relations had improved 
<br>markedly after President Nixon visited Syria in 1974 to 
<br>discuss peace with Israel.  "That's our issue," he stressed, 
<br>noting that the Golan track had been active under President 
<br>Carter but then dormant through most of the 1980s and the 
<br>early part of the current decade. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------- 
<br>Iraq: Political Cooperation, Then Security Cooperation 
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------- 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (S)  Senator Bayh observed that many things in Syria had 
<br>changed for the better since his 2002 visit.  Now, there were 
<br>positive indicators that bilateral relations might be on the 
<br>upswing as well.  One area, however, in which relations had 
<br>not improved was intelligence cooperation.  The U.S. and 
<br>Syria appeared to have common interests in seeing a stable 
<br>Iraq, not dominated by Iran.  Yet, foreign extremists 
<br>continued to travel through Syria into Iraq.  The U.S. had 
<br>provided information regarding four named individuals to the 
<br>Syrian government, but nothing had happened.  Perhaps now was 
<br>a propitious moment to consider re-establishing intelligence 
<br>ties, Bayh suggested.  Asad concurred with the idea of 
<br>overlapping U.S.-Syrian interests in Iraq.  He noted, 
<br>however, that the main obstacle to increased U.S.-Syrian 
<br>security cooperation stemmed from the absence of political 
<br>cooperation.  The U.S. possessed a "huge information 
<br>apparatus" but lacked the ability to analyze this information 
<br>successfully, maintained Asad.  "You're failing in the fight 
<br>against extremism.  While we lack your intelligence 
<br>capabilities, we succeed in fighting extremists because we 
<br>have better analysts," he claimed, attributing the superior 
<br>analysis to living in and understanding the region. 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (S)  Syria, Asad explained, had refused to cooperate with 
<br>President Bush because it did not trust him and because the 
<br>Bush Administration had wrongfully accused Syria of 
<br>supporting foreign fighters.  When President Obama assumed 
<br>office, Syria tried to be positive.  Asad he had proposed to 
<br>Special Envoy Mitchell the idea of a border security 
<br>cooperation initiative with Iraq as a first step.  (Post 
<br>Comment: Asad's recollection is both selective and 
<br>inaccurate.  U.S. officials first proposed a border security 
<br>cooperation initiative to a reluctant FM Muallim in May 2009. 
<br> President Asad agreed to participate after meeting S/E 
<br>Mitchell in late July 2009.)  "This was a small step for me, 
<br>but big for you," Asad argued.  Citing the U.S. inability to 
<br>control its long border with Mexico, Asad said the border was 
<br>not the major challenge.  Syria's close intelligence 
<br>cooperation with Turkey enabled both countries to prevent 
<br>terrorists from crossing their 860-kilometer border without 
<br>relying on a huge border security presence.  This 
<br>intelligence cooperation enabled Syria to "suffocate" 
<br>logistical networks critical to the movement of terrorists. 
<br>"In the U.S., you like to shoot (terrorists).  Suffocating 
<br>their networks is far more effective," said Asad. 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (S)  Asad said Syria required a positive first step prior 
<br>to resuming intelligence cooperation, a position that Senator 
<br>Mitchell had accepted.  Syria had succeeded in convincing 
<br>Iraqi PM Maliki on August 18 to reverse its opposition to the 
<br>trilateral border security initiative and was ready to 
<br>participate.  After the August 19 bombings and Iraqi 
<br>accusations against Syria for facilitating the terrorist 
<br>attacks, Syria remained willing to participate in the border 
<br>assessments.  It was the U.S., Asad insisted, that had backed 
<br>away.  Syria had no interest in supporting extremists, who 
<br>weren't killing Americans but rather Iraqi civilians.  "That 
<br> 
<br>DAMASCUS 00000008  004 OF 006 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>hurts us," Asad claimed.  U.S. "mistakes in Iraq" had cost 
<br>Syria and the region a great deal.  Syria had out of 
<br>self-interest sought to deter terrorists who popped up. 
<br>Still, despite a shared interest with the U.S. in ensuring 
<br>Iraqi stability, Syria would not immediately jump to 
<br>intelligence cooperation without ensuring its own interests 
<br>would be respected.  "I won't give it (intelligence 
<br>cooperation) to you for free," he said.  Senator Bayh replied 
<br>that the U.S. was working to normalize relations and 
<br>considering positive steps to take along the way.  Syria, 
<br>Asad commented, had been clear on how to start rebuilding 
<br>relations.  "We didn't say no," he said, "but we have to 
<br>build from an absence of trust." 
<br> 
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br>Asad:  Door Open to Iranian Nuclear Deal 
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (S)  Senator Cornyn commented the most dire threat to 
<br>regional peace stemmed from Iran's nuclear aspirations. 
<br>Syrian interests could well suffer if there were a conflict 
<br>between Israel and Iran and possibly others.  Asad replied no 
<br>one could predict the course of a conflict; therefore, it was 
<br>better to avoid one.  The Bush Administration took a 
<br>political approach to Iran instead of dealing with the 
<br>nuclear issue in the context of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
<br> Under the NPT, Iran enjoys the right to enrich uranium, 
<br>provided there is IAEA monitoring.  Instead of trying to stop 
<br>Iran's program, the international emphasis should shift to 
<br>ensuring proper monitoring.  Iran had accepted the principle 
<br>of enriching uranium outside of its borders.  Now the 
<br>challenge was how to meet Iran's concern that shipping all of 
<br>its LEU at once would risk not receiving any in return.  Asad 
<br>claimed Iran sought only to enrich its uranium to 20 percent, 
<br>well bellow the 95 percent threshold necessary for 
<br>weapons-grade material.  If the international community 
<br>agreed to divide Iran's shipments into four or five parts, 
<br>Iran would be flexible, Asad argued.  In the meantime, Israel 
<br>had to forget about attacking Iran.  Such a move would only 
<br>encourage Iran to follow the path of India, Pakistan, and 
<br>others in seeking a nuclear weapon.  Syria opposed this 
<br>outcome, but viewed the only solution was to recognize Iran's 
<br>rights and demonstrate flexibility in foreign enrichment, 
<br>Asad said. 
<br> 
<br>¶11.  (S)  Later in the conversation, Senator Specter argued 
<br>Iran appeared to be blocking a deal.  Asad claimed Iranian 
<br>diplomacy was now more flexible because the government was 
<br>stronger and more confident after the 2009 elections.  Noting 
<br>he had shared this assessment with French President Sarkozy, 
<br>Asad said he judged Iran to be looking for cooperative signs. 
<br> Iran represented the most important country in the region, 
<br>Asad assessed, ranking Turkey second and Syria third.  The 
<br>U.S. had troops in Afghanistan and needed better relations 
<br>with Iran.  Specter agreed the enrichment issue could be 
<br>solved; Russia had offered to enrich Iranian uranium several 
<br>years ago, subject to international monitoring.  Iran had 
<br>answered yes, replied Asad, but the issue was how to proceed. 
<br> Iran's desire to divide the uranium shipments represented 
<br>the only difference: if the West agreed, the issue would be 
<br>solved.  There was an open door; if the nuclear issue could 
<br>be solved, the peace process would proceed more easily.  But 
<br>if conflict erupted, the regional context would become 
<br>extremely complicated. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br>Discussion of Detained Amcits in Iran 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>DAMASCUS 00000008  005 OF 006 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶12.  (S)  Senator Klobuchar commented that she had supported 
<br>Barak Obama because of his promise to advance a new approach 
<br>to international relations.  While there were no easy 
<br>solutions in the region, the U.S. and Syria appeared to have 
<br>overlapping interests in avoiding war and in ensuring a 
<br>strong and stable Iraq.  From the U.S. perspective, Syria 
<br>might demonstrate as a goodwill gesture its interest in 
<br>better relations by helping obtain the release of three 
<br>American citizens -- Joshua Fattal, Shane Bauer and Sarah 
<br>Shourd -- who apparrently crossed into Iran while hiking in 
<br>northeastern Iraq.  Swiss officials had visited them, but 
<br>they were isolated and the U.S. lacked information on their 
<br>whereabouts and any pending charges. 
<br> 
<br>¶13.  (S)  Asad replied he was unfamiliar with their case and 
<br>requested that the Embassy send more information.  Senator 
<br>Specter interjected later in the conversation that the 
<br>Embassy had delivered a letter to the MFA that week from the 
<br>Secretary.  Specter added he had personally raised the matter 
<br>in Washington with Syrian Ambassador Imad Mustafa.  The U.S. 
<br>would view positively Syrian efforts to secure the three 
<br>Americans' release, Specter said, comparing the case to the 
<br>Iranian detention of UK sailors whom Syria helped to free. 
<br>"We'll try our best," replied Asad, saying it would be 
<br>necessary to ask about the legal aspects of the case. 
<br>Specter clarified there had been no charges filed.  It had 
<br>started as a trespassing case, but U.S.-Iranian relations 
<br>were so poor it was impossible to resolve. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- --- 
<br>Re-Opening DCS:  Syria Awaiting U.S. Steps First 
<br>--------------------------------------------- --- 
<br> 
<br>¶13.  (S)  Senator Klobuchar and Senator Enzi argued Syria 
<br>might demonstrate good will by re-opening the Damascus 
<br>Community School (DCS), whose closure had hurt not just 
<br>American students, but also many foreigners and Syrians. 
<br>Senator Enzi said his committee's purview on education 
<br>created a personal interest in seeing the DCS re-opened; the 
<br>school's closure represented a step away from moving towards 
<br>positive relations.  Asad replied he wanted to open Syria to 
<br>the rest of the world.  In September 2008, for example, the 
<br>French Embassy opened a new international school.  Asad 
<br>explained he had ordered DCS's closure after a U.S. military 
<br>attack on Syrian soil had killed seven innocent civilians in 
<br>late October 2008.  "We had to respond," he argued, saying 
<br>the school's closure "was the only step we could take" in 
<br>response to the Bush Administration.  President Carter, Asad 
<br>continued, had urged the reopening of DCS during his December 
<br>2008 visit.  "I told Carter that we are ready," said Asad, 
<br>who noted the Syrian government wanted to send positive 
<br>signals to the Obama administration and had done so by 
<br>re-opening the American Cultural Center (ACC). 
<br> 
<br>¶14. (S) FM Muallim noted that only part of the American 
<br>Language Center portion of ACC had been allowed to re-open. 
<br>He argued that he and other Syrian officials had told State 
<br>Department officials that steps by Syria to improve relations 
<br>first required U.S. steps.  "We can't move without a waiver 
<br>for Syrian Airlines," he argued, citing the threat to Syrian 
<br>civilians posed a U.S. ban on the sale of civilian aircraft 
<br>and spare parts.  Asad noted that a good friend who ran a 
<br>medical laboratory was similarly unable to import U.S. lab 
<br>technology.  The bigger issue, Asad said, was about bilateral 
<br>relations.  Syria's intent was to re-open the DCS.  Asad said 
<br>he trusted President Carter and supported President Obama. 
<br>"We know he has other problems and priorities, but there must 
<br>be U.S. steps," Asad insisted.
