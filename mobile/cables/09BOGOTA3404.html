<br>SUBJECT: Colombian MFA Sounds Alarm about Citizenship Fraud
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: On October 15, 2009 AmEmb Bogota's consular
<br>Fraud Prevention Unit (FPU) met with the head of the passport
<br>office at the Colombian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), Mauricio
<br>Acero. Acero requested the meeting to alert FPU to a fraud trend
<br>whereby foreign nationals fraudulently obtain Colombian civil
<br>documents which are then used to request passports. Investigations
<br>by the MFA have led to the revocation of fraudulently-obtained
<br>passports of 24 individuals, while 340 cases remain under
<br>investigation. The cases most frequently involve people of
<br>Lebanese descent, but also Syrians, Palestinians, Jordanians,
<br>Venezuelans, and Cubans. END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>---------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>Citizenship fraud begins with civil documents
<br>
<br>---------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) Acero highlighted that Colombia's civil documents system
<br>is ripe for fraud as the requirements for obtaining birth
<br>certificates are lenient. Once an individual is in possession of a
<br>Colombian birth certificate they can obtain a national
<br>identification number, which is then used to get a passport. With
<br>a valid national ID, the MFA is required by law to issue a
<br>passport. Acero requested that Embassy personnel voice concern
<br>about gaps in citizenship procedures in the course of high-level
<br>contacts with the Colombian government.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>----------------
<br>
<br>Fraud indicators
<br>
<br>----------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) The perpetrators of citizenship fraud, according to Acero,
<br>tend to be male and between the ages of 20-25. They often use a
<br>baptism certificate to establish their place of birth (instead of
<br>the customary hospital certification of birth) and claim to have
<br>been born at home. Often the two mandatory witnesses of the birth
<br>will be indigenous. The birth certificate, national identification
<br>card and passport will often have issuance dates in close
<br>proximity. In the case of Lebanese, Syrians, Palestinians, and
<br>Jordanians the subject's first (paternal) last name will be Arab
<br>and the second (maternal) last name will be Spanish. Through a
<br>series of legal procedures, the paternal last name is dropped over
<br>time. The cases tend to come from Maicao, San Andres,
<br>Barranquilla, and Ipiales.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>
<br>Motivations to commit citizenship fraud
<br>
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) Acero told FPU that Lebanese, Syrians, Palestinians, and
<br>Jordanians are motivated to obtain Colombian citizenship to hide
<br>criminal records, avoid military service in their home country,
<br>provide a better future for their children, and for ease in
<br>international travel. The motivations for Cubans and Venezuelans,
<br>on the other hand, are less clear. Acero hypothesized that some
<br>Cubans might wish to escape the regime while others might be using
<br>
<br>
<br>BOGOTA 00003404 002 OF 002
<br>
<br>
<br>a Colombian identity as a cover for Cuban intelligence operations.
<br>As for Venezuelans, he said that the motivations are still unclear.

<br>Comment

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) FPU spoke with other agencies at Post about the trend.
<br>They noted that this is an on-going issue and concurred that the
<br>motives tend to be to hide criminal backgrounds.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) While Acero did not point to specific malfeasance
<br>involving U.S. visas, FPU appreciated the information and is on the
<br>look-out for the fraud indicators highlighted. FPU requested the
<br>names of the 340 individuals under investigation for citizenship
<br>fraud. The request is under consideration by the MFA.
