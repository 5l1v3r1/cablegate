<br>
<br>Classified By: ISN/MTR DIRECTOR PAM DURHAM FOR REASONS
<br>1.4 (b), (c), and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (U) This is an action request. Embassy Berlin

<br>has information indicating that the Chinese subsidiary
<br>of the German firm xxxxxxxxxxxx test chamber to Iran's Defense Industries
<br>
<br>Organization (DIO), an entity sanctioned under United

<br>understand that as of mid-May 2009, Chinese national
<br>and known proliferator xxxxxxxxxxxx was working to arrange
<br>training on the test chamber for DIO representatives -
<br>likely on the premises of xxxxxxxxxxxx China. Although this
<br>particular test chamber is not controlled by the
<br>Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), it is
<br>suitable for subjecting missile components and systems
<br>to the harsh environmental conditions experienced by
<br>missiles during launch, flight, and reentry. We want
<br>to ask German officials to investigate this information
<br>and ensure that xxxxxxxxxxxx is taking all measures
<br>necessary to prevent unauthorized retransfers of its
<br>goods by foreign-based subsidiaries - especially to
<br>entities of proliferation concern.
