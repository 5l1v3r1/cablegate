<br>SUBJECT: MEDVEDEV'S CALL FOR REFORM: ANYONE LISTENING? 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador John R. Beyrle; reasons 1.4(b/d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: President Medvedev's article "Russia 
<br>Forward," released on the Internet with little fanfare 
<br>September 10, launched a vociferous debate among politicians 
<br>and analysts about the feasibility and probability of the 
<br>kinds of reforms needed to implement his vision for a more 
<br>diverse economy, healthier population and engaged citizenry. 
<br>It also launched the fall political season, fueling 
<br>speculation of divisions within the tandem and jockeying for 
<br>position before 2012 elections. The article is not so much a 
<br>break with the Putin past, as an attempt to moderate its 
<br>excesses. Regardless of who wrote it, Medvedev has now 
<br>linked his political fortunes to realizing its vision. End 
<br>Summary. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) In a lengthy essay entitled "Russia Forward," first 
<br>released mid-day September 10 on the liberal Gazeta.ru 
<br>Internet website, and later posted to the Kremlin's website, 
<br>President Medvedev described a litany of ills that plague 
<br>Russia: reliance on the export of raw materials as the 
<br>primary source of national income; the decrepit state of 
<br>infrastructure; the cancer of corruption; and the weaknesses 
<br>of civil society and the institutions meant to channel 
<br>citizen participation in government. It is a bluntly 
<br>pessimistic assessment, combined with a vague call to action 
<br>and an appeal to the public to support him in combating these 
<br>ills and to rally, as they did in World War II, to defeat 
<br>these new enemies that threaten their country's and 
<br>children's future. Medvedev focuses on the imperatives of 
<br>modernization, of economic diversification and of the 
<br>involvement of an active, engaged citizenry, in fighting 
<br>corruption. He is unusually pointed in identifying an 
<br>"ensconced group of corrupt officials and do-nothing 
<br>entrepreneurs" as the chief source of these problems. The 
<br>article presents no solutions to the maladies outlined. 
<br>Medvedev is fact eschews the more liberal path of the 1990's, 
<br>repeating oft-used complaints against the "liberals" who 
<br>brought political chaos and economic and financial 
<br>destitution to Russia by the end of that decade. 
<br>
<br>Reactions - Call for Action? Plea for Sympathy? 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Medvedev succeeded, if in doing nothing else, in 
<br>giving political commentators ample material for policy - and 
<br>political analysis. His manifesto answered the call of many 
<br>elites who had been demanding a strong declaration of 
<br>presidential views on the present situation. Others are 
<br>connecting this article with his previous declarations, 
<br>noting that, as in the past, the rhetoric comes without any 
<br>concrete proposals for resolving these issues. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Speculation began immediately as to the author of the 
<br>text. Some credit Medvedev with writing much of the article 
<br>himself, noting that it elaborates on themes he has been 
<br>publicly stressing during his presidency - his famous (if 
<br>dormant) four "I's," the fight against corruption, poor 
<br>infrastructure (roads, health care, etc.), demographic 
<br>problems and the need for citizen participation. Some have 
<br>focused on this exposition as a not-so-veiled critique of the 
<br>Putin years - building on Medvedev's earlier comments after 
<br>the dam disaster about the country lagging technologically. 
<br>However, others see in the text the hand of Vladislav Surkov, 
<br>Kremlin architect of Russia's "sovereign" democracy. Most of 
<br>the article's main themes - Russia's backwardness, the 
<br>do-nothing entrepreneurs, high-tech as an economic salvation 
<br>- were previewed by Surkov in a July 28 discussion with 
<br>Ambassador. The appeal for greater public involvement in the 
<br>managed, strictly-defined institutions created by Surkov 
<br>could only have been promoted by the "Grey Cardinal" himself. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) For the most part reaction among leading political 
<br>commentators - on editorial pages of major newspapers, on the 
<br>radio talk show circuit and on the plethora of 
<br>politically-oriented blogs - has been politely welcoming of 
<br>Medvedev's intentions, but critical of the clear disconnect 
<br>between his stated ideals, and the very different reality 
<br>which he plays a role in sustaining. XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>described Medvedev's perspective as a "Soviet way of looking
<br>at things;" the reality, and what those in power paint as the
<br>reality, do not correspond. XXXXXXXXXXXX argued
<br>that it was hypocritical of Medvedev to talk about political
<br>competition when in Moscow opposition parties are denied
<br>the right to participate in elections. He belittled the calls for 
<br>political engagement by citizens in the current Putin-made 
<br>
<br>MOSCOW 00002354 002 OF 003 
<br>
<br>system - of which Medvedev is a direct beneficiary - a system 
<br>that has in fact dismantled pluralism and restricted 
<br>political involvement. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX emphasized that the article is a trial
<br>balloon for  Medvedev's annual address to the nation (poslanie),
<br>planned  for late October or early November. It was reported weeks 
<br>ago that Medvedev and a team of consultants had already begun 
<br>work on a draft during summer holidays in Sochi. While his 
<br>2008 poslanie centered on political reform, his 2009 address 
<br>is said to focus on economic reforms. XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>charged that  the article - perhaps one basis for the poslanie - is an 
<br>appeal for ideas, but not a clear call to liberals trumpeting 
<br>their goals and aspirations. Rather, it charts a middle 
<br>course, and will be used by both liberals and conservatives 
<br>for their own purposes. It is a political document, intended 
<br>not to advance the goals he speaks of, but to bolster his 
<br>position among both camps. XXXXXXXXXXXX criticized the
<br>article  for not having outlined solutions and for its sharp
<br>rejection  of any constructive lessons that could be gleaned
<br>from the  so-called liberal ways of the 1990's and be applied to 
<br>address Russia's problems of today. 
<br>
<br>Medvedev in 2012? Tandem Tensions? 
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX has warmed to giving him the benefit
<br>of the  doubt in recent months, told us that he appreciated the 
<br>sentiments that motivated the article, but was frustrated 
<br>that there was no plan outlined for action. XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>argued that the kind of development envisioned by Medvedev
<br>is hindered by an alliance between business and government
<br>bureaucracy -  business pays off the bureaucracy and bureaucracy
<br>defends  business from real competition. Until that bond is broken, 
<br>real economic reform based on innovation will be impossible. 
<br>Medvedev's indictment of the judicial system was also on 
<br>target, he told us, but would require a long-term commitment 
<br>to fighting entrenched interests if it is to be reformed. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX called the article's ideas "Putin 2.0," 
<br>modifications to the general principles that have guided Russia
<br>over the past decade, but  not a rejection of them. Combined
<br>with Putin once again  publicly toying with the idea of running
<br>for president in  2012, Medvedev's article revives speculation
<br> that the two  leaders do not see eye-to-eye on major issues,
<br>and that  should Medvedev not build momentum for the
<br>changes he  espouses, Putin may step forward to present a status
<br>quo  platform more to the liking of the oligarchs and possibly 
<br>more appealing to average citizens. While the Internet is 
<br>abuzz with commentary on the article, state-run television 
<br>has accorded it minimal coverage, focusing more on Putin's 
<br>annual performance before the Valdai Group. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Kremlin-sanctioned opposition political parties (KPRF, 
<br>LDPR, Just Russia and Right Cause) issued mildly supportive 
<br>statements about the President's appeal for national 
<br>dialogue, though KPRF Deputy Chairman Melnikov argued that 
<br>the call will fall on deaf ears given that "the state has 
<br>worked hard to switch off the peoples' minds in recent 
<br>years." Yabloko leadership issued a scathing rebuke, calling 
<br>the article nothing but empty words when judged against 
<br>Medvedev's ineffectiveness in defending basic freedoms and 
<br>democracy during his presidency. 
<br>
<br>Where to from Here? 
<br>------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) While the initial disappointment over the absence of 
<br>concrete proposals may be understandable, Medvedev himself 
<br>cautioned that change would be evolutionary, not 
<br>revolutionary. Taken with the results of a recent Levada 
<br>poll that shows regional leaders more disposed toward Putin, 
<br>Medvedev may be taking a slow approach, connecting with his 
<br>"base" - urbanites, better-educated elites and the 
<br>Internet-connected middle class - seeking their support for 
<br>processes which will have benefits not for them, but for 
<br>their children. Having responded to the growing uneasiness 
<br>among his "base" that he had not yet used his "bully pulpit" 
<br>enough to put forward an agenda to correct the political 
<br>deterioration and economically-myopic policies of the Putin 
<br>years (fixated on the export of raw materials), Medvedev has 
<br>sparked a national debate - at least among those with access 
<br>
<br>MOSCOW 00002354 003 OF 003 
<br>
<br>to the Internet (33 percent of Russians). Given that Putin's 
<br>support is the main source of Medvedev's hold on power, it is 
<br>hard to imagine that the article could have been released 
<br>without general agreement with its content by Putin himself. 
<br>Whoever wrote the actual article, it is a first-person 
<br>Medvedev document, and his political credibility depends on 
<br>follow-through -- with citizens, in his poslanie and in 
<br>taking on entrenched bureaucratic and business interests.
