<br>SUBJECT: ELECTIONS IN COTE D'IVOIRE: THE MYTH AND THE 
<br>REALITY 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Wanda L. Nesbitt for Reasons 1.4 (b/d) 
<br>
<br>¶1. C) Summary: Although key figures in the Ivorian government 
<br>and opposition continue to insist publicly that elections 
<br>must be held as scheduled on November 29, resident diplomats 
<br>are highly skeptical, as are most politically-savvy Ivorians. 
<br>The gap between public pronouncements and the 
<br>behind-the-scenes reality has become so clear, in fact, that 
<br>UN SRSG Choi has started referring in private conversations 
<br>to the "myth and reality" of elections in Cote d'Ivoire. This 
<br>message describes the key myths and realities as we see them. 
<br>End Summary 
<br>
<br>MYTH #1: Cote d'Ivoire Will Hold Elections in November 2009 
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) The Ivorian government, Independent Electoral 
<br>Commission(CEI), and opposition candidates have not deviated 
<br>in public from the commitment to hold elections this year. 
<br>But the date was set in response to international pressure 
<br>(predominantly from the French and the UN) and a key 
<br>motivation of each of the central actors is to avoid being 
<br>fingered as being responsible for the delay. Continuing to 
<br>pay tribute to the 'myth' that elections will take place as 
<br>scheduled is viewed as necessary to demonstrate a commitment 
<br>to the process. The truth, however, is that electoral 
<br>preparations are already lagging behind schedule and deep 
<br>doubts persist about the willingness of those currently in 
<br>power to risk losing office. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) The Reality: There will not be an election unless 
<br>President Gbagbo is confident that he will win it -- and he 
<br>is not yet confident of the outcome. This has been the 
<br>assessment of some analysts since 2005 and the political 
<br>landscape in Cote d'Ivoire helps to explain why. Gbagbo's 
<br>political party, the FPI (Front Populaire Ivoirien), 
<br>consistently comes in at third place is still associated with 
<br>a minority ethnic group (the Bete). To win a presidential 
<br>election, the FPI needs an alliance with one of the larger 
<br>parties - either the PDCI (Parti Democratique de Cote 
<br>d'Ivoire) or the RDR (Rassemblement des Republicains), but 
<br>the latter have remained remarkably united in an alliance 
<br>against the FPI, known as the RHDP (Rassemblement des 
<br>Houphouetistes). Reliable sources indicate that Gbagbo has 
<br>tried since at least 2007 to cut a deal with Alassane 
<br>Ouattara, president of the RDR, but has not succeeded. 
<br>Ambassador was told just last week that having failed yet 
<br>again to co-opt Ouattara, Gbagbo is now focused on promoting 
<br>a rift within the PDCI by helping to finance and support 
<br>former-Prime Minister Charles Banny's efforts to replace 
<br>aging former-President Henri Konan Bedie as the PDCI's 
<br>candidate for president. Whether or not Banny succeeds is 
<br>irrelevant from the FPI's perspective, as long as the 
<br>internal struggle induces a certain percentage of PDCI voters 
<br>to go elsewhere. Gbagbo recently told a well-placed source 
<br>that he wants to face Alassane Ouattara in the second round 
<br>(no one expects a winner to emerge from the first round) 
<br>because he (Gbagbo) believes that the ethnic groups who 
<br>traditionally support the PDCI will vote FPI, rather that 
<br>support an RDR leader who has links to the rebellion. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) In addition to these calculations, there are other 
<br>reasons for the governing coalition to want to hang on for as 
<br>long as they can. Cote d'Ivoire will celebrate the 50th 
<br>anniversary of its independence in August 2010. Savvy 
<br>observers do not believe that President Gbagbo (who savors 
<br>the role of Le Grand Chef) will risk losing the prestige and 
<br>celebrity that goes with hosting such an historic event. 
<br>Also, the GOCI lobbied successfully to host the spring 2010 
<br>meeting of the African Development Bank's general assembly, 
<br>an event that we believe Gbagbo will use to declare that Cote 
<br>d'Ivoire's crisis has been resolved and the country has 
<br>returned to normal, even if elections have not been held. 
<br>Thus the fall of 2010 currently appears to be the most 
<br>realistic potential timeframe for elections. President Gbagbo 
<br>will been in office for ten years (the equivalent of two 
<br>terms) and although he has stated publicly that he considers 
<br>himself to be in an extended first mandate,remaining in 
<br>office without a new mandate will become harder to justify 
<br>after 2010. The financial benefits of the status quo are, of 
<br>course, a prime consideration and not just for the FPI but 
<br>for individuals such as the PM Soro (Secretary General of the 
<br>Forces Nouvelles) as well. 
<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Embassy will be sending septel a detailed report on 
<br>the status of the voter registration process and logistical 
<br>preparations for the elections. While progress is being made, 
<br>the picture is not encouraging in terms of a vote this year. 
<br>
<br>For despite months of dedicated work and millions of dollars 
<br>worth of expenditures, not a single voter registration or 
<br>national ID card has been produced. Data collected partly by 
<br>hand on over 6 million individuals must be computerized, 
<br>linked up with fingerprints and vaQed before cards can be 
<br>produced and distributed. The likelihood that this will be 
<br>accomplished before November is slim, and there is no 
<br>indication that either the President or the Prime Minister's 
<br>office is pushing for rapid action. 
<br>
<br>MYTH #2: The Forces Nouvelles Are Disarming; 
<br>Cote d'Ivoire Is Being Reunified 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) Cote d'Ivoire has held a number of symbolic 
<br>ceremonies to mark advances in the sortie de crise (crisis 
<br>recovery) program, such as the Flame of Peace cermony in 
<br>2007, numerous demobilization ceremonies in 2008, and most 
<br>recently on May 26, a ceremony to launch the handing over of 
<br>power from rebel zone commanders (comzones) to civilian 
<br>authorities. Genuine progress has indeed been made: 
<br>thousands of young men have abandoned the rebellion and 
<br>civilian authorities have returned to every major city in the 
<br>north, if not every district. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) The Reality: The progress that has been made is, 
<br>unfortunately, only superficial, for it now appears that the 
<br>Ouaga IV agreement (the fourth agreement to the Ouagadougou 
<br>Political Agreement) is fundamentally an agreement between 
<br>Blaise Compaore and Laurent Gbagbo to share control of the 
<br>north until after the presidential election, despite the fact 
<br>that the text calls for the Forces Nouvelles to return 
<br>control of the north to the government and complete 
<br>disarmament two months before the election. Ambassador 
<br>Badini (Facilitator Blaise Compaore's representative in 
<br>Abidjan) confirmed to Ambassador on June 26, the 
<br>power-sharing nature (but not the details) of the accord. 
<br>Badini acknowledged that the mixed brigades (joint FAFN-FDS 
<br>units) slated to provide security for the elections are 
<br>intended in part to give both sides a window onto what is 
<br>happening in the north, and increase confidence that massive 
<br>fraud will not take place. But the 5,000 Forces Nouvelles 
<br>soldiers who are to be "disarmed" and regrouped into barracks 
<br>in four key cities in the north and west until a new national 
<br>army is created, represent a serious military capability that 
<br>the FAFN intends to keep well-trained and in reserve until 
<br>after the election. The hand-over of administrative power 
<br>from the FAFN to civilian government authorities is a 
<br>pre-requisite for elections but, as travelers to the north 
<br>(including Embassy personnel) confirm: the FAFN retain 
<br>de-facto control of the region, especially when it comes to 
<br>finances. Disarmament and reunification are not separate 
<br>processes. They are intertwined. As long as the confidence 
<br>needed to effect disarmament is lacking, reunification will 
<br>prove elusive. 
<br>
<br>Implications 
<br>------------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) There is a silver lining to this cloud, and it is the 
<br>fact that Compaore (perceived as the benefactor of the FAFN) 
<br>and Gbagbo are engaged in a direct dialogue designed to put 
<br>an end to the conflict that erupted with the failed coup 
<br>d'etat in 2002. They have taken ownership of the problem and 
<br>while this has effectively reduced the role the international 
<br>community can play, their apparent willingness to resolve 
<br>their differences peacefully has led to distinct 
<br>improvements. Tensions have been reduced as the relationship 
<br>between the President Gbagbo and PM Soro has improved, and no 
<br>one expQ a full-scale civil war to resume although there 
<br>is still a potential for clashes between rival elements. Our 
<br>posture as an interested and active member of the 
<br>international community has been the most effective stance we 
<br>have taken and we will continue to play that role unless the 
<br>situation changes.
