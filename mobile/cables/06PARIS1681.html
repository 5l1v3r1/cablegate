<br>OF VILLEPIN'S PRESIDENTIAL CHANCES 
<br>
<br>REF: PARIS 953 
<br>
<br>Classified By: PolMC Josiah Rosenblatt for reasons 1.4 (B & D). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Former Industry Minister and close Sarkozy 
<br>advisor Patrick Devedjian predicted March 15 that student and 
<br>labor union opposition to the First Employment Contract (CPE) 
<br>was spreading and might yet become a major test for the 
<br>government. In any event, he believed that PM de Villepin 
<br>was finished as a potential presidential candidate. 
<br>Devedjian blamed the current impasse squarely on Villepin's 
<br>impetuousness and autocratic methods, which, while leaving 
<br>the governing party (and Sarkozy) no choice but to support 
<br>him publicly, had given the opposition Socialist Party a 
<br>potent rallying call for coalescing against the government. 
<br>He thought it possible but not likely that Villepin would be 
<br>replaced, but ruled out a Sarkozy prime ministership as 
<br>"suicidal." Devedjian nonetheless judged that knowledge of 
<br>Sarkozy's "differences" with President Chirac and Villepin, 
<br>despite his official support for the government, would spare 
<br>him most of the electorate's wrath and leave him well 
<br>positioned to win the 2007 party nomination and presidential 
<br>elections. Devedjian saw Segolene Royal as the opponent to 
<br>be most feared on the left, although he thought she might 
<br>self-destruct if nominated by the PS, and believed that the 
<br>PS would probably prevent her from winning its nomination in 
<br>any case. Comment: Devedjian's views, reported here, are 
<br>four parts hard analysis, one part wishful thinking. End 
<br>comment and summary. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) Patrick Devedjian, former Industry Minister and close 
<br>advisor to Interior Minister and UMP President Nicolas 
<br>Sarkozy, met March 15 with Embassy reps from the U.S., the 
<br>UK, Austria, Germany, Italy, Spain and Russia to discuss the 
<br>state of play with respect to the First Employment Contract 
<br>(CPE) and its impact on the current government under PM de 
<br>Villepin, as well as the line-up for the 2007 presidential 
<br>elections. 
<br>
<br>CPE and spreading unrest 
<br>------------------------ 
<br>¶3. (C) Devedjian described growing public opposition to the 
<br>First Employment Contract (CPE) and declared he "was not 
<br>optimistic" for the future, even if there was some hope that 
<br>unemployment figures would begin to improve again. He 
<br>predicted a turbulent period ahead -- beginning with the 
<br>large demonstration planned for March 18 -- which would last 
<br>at least one and one-half to two months, and judged that the 
<br>government's only real option would be to try to ride out the 
<br>storm in the hope that public opinion would eventually turn 
<br>against the protesters. Although the government had promised 
<br>a few amendments to the law to appease public opinion and was 
<br>now expressing a willingness to engage in dialogue, Devedjian 
<br>expressed concern that the manner in which the government had 
<br>proceeded had resulted in uniting, or in his word, 
<br>"coagulating," its adversaries. He concluded that 
<br>developments had now moved "beyond the CPE." 
<br>
<br>More important than unrest in suburbs 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br>¶4. (C) Devedjian noted ironically that the students 
<br>currently protesting against the CPE were relatively 
<br>privileged and much more likely to find jobs than the 
<br>uneducated and unemployed youths in the suburbs whom the CPE 
<br>was intended to help. He saw nothing particularly unusual 
<br>about this state of affairs, saying this was what always 
<br>happened in France. He termed the November unrest in the 
<br>suburbs "a revolt without a message" (sans discours), 
<br>concluding that it was primarily a cultural revolt by 
<br>third-generation immigrants. At the same time, he argued 
<br>against multiculturalism, saying that the real problem lay in 
<br>France's failure to inculcate adequately French culture and 
<br>values into these unemployed youths and in the government's 
<br>long-time policy of effectively ghettoizing immigrant 
<br>populations in lieu of dispersing them throughout French 
<br>society. He called for some kind of affirmative action and 
<br>stressed the importance of demonstrating visibly that members 
<br>of a minority can make it to the top. In sum, he did not 
<br>appear to take last fall's suburban violence all that 
<br>seriously. While the images of the unrest were spectacular, 
<br>he said, they had little real (political) import. 
<br>
<br>Villepin to blame 
<br>----------------- 
<br>¶5. (C) Devedjian viewed Villepin's impetuous personality and 
<br>autocratic style as largely responsible for the current 
<br>impasse. Villepin's decision, during the recent debate in 
<br>the National Assembly, to let other ministers respond to 
<br>hostile questioning and distance himself personally from the 
<br>CPE would not succeed in attenuating this perception. 
<br>Devedjian blamed Villepin for his refusal to engage in 
<br>dialogue with the labor unions before proceeding -- in 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00001681 002 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>particular with the generally pro-reform-minded CFDT that had 
<br>supported Raffarin's pension reforms, and which had now 
<br>turned against him. He criticized Villepin for repeating 
<br>Balladur's mistake of 1994 of singling out one specific 
<br>segment of the French public for reform, which to the French 
<br>electorate smacked of discrimination and violated the 
<br>principle of equality. Devedjian especially castigated 
<br>Villepin's recourse to article 49.3 of the constitution to 
<br>put a stop to parliamentary debate as "very dangerous" and a 
<br>blow to the strength of democratic institutions. He decried 
<br>France's "monarchical mentality," which viewed decisions in 
<br>terms of decrees and offered solutions before discussing the 
<br>questions. 
<br>
<br>UMP trapped, but Villepin finished 
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br>¶6. (C) Devedjian described a UMP trapped by Villepin -- 
<br>forced to support him on the CPE without enthusiasm because 
<br>it was obligated to support the government. He believed that 
<br>the government, having closed the doors to dialogue, no 
<br>longer had any escape paths. Villepin's decision not to 
<br>allow the opposition to debate the issue in parliament, if 
<br>only as a venting exercise, had ineluctably moved the debate 
<br>into the streets. Devedjian judged that the current unrest 
<br>would spell the death knell for Villepin's presidential 
<br>aspirations. If things got bad enough, he held out the 
<br>possibility that Chirac would have to appoint a new prime 
<br>minister, probably either Defense Minister Michele 
<br>Alliot-Marie or Employment and Social Cohesion Minister 
<br>Jean-Louis Borloo, while judging in the end that Chirac would 
<br>probably stick with Villepin. Devedjian firmly ruled out the 
<br>possibility of Sarkozy accepting the job as prime minister, 
<br>which he said would be "suicidal." He did not believe that 
<br>President Chirac would withdraw the law and suffer yet 
<br>another loss of face. But whether the CPE remains or is 
<br>jettisoned, Devedjian concluded, this would be the last 
<br>reform pushed through by the current government. 
<br>
<br>Socialists smell blood 
<br>---------------------- 
<br>¶7. (C) Devedjian said that the Socialist Party (PS) had now 
<br>smelled blood and had come to the conclusion that its views, 
<br>and not those of the governing party, were more 
<br>representative of a majority of the French electorate. 
<br>Moreover, this was the latest in a string of setbacks that 
<br>included, inter alia, the failed referendum on the EU 
<br>constitutional treaty, growing opprobrium directed against 
<br>Chirac, and the recent wave of social unrest in the suburbs. 
<br>Sarkozy, he asserted, was the best positioned to overcome 
<br>this alienation, since the public and press largely 
<br>understood that he supported the government but was different 
<br>from it (solidaire mais different). This would remain so 
<br>despite efforts by PS presidential hopeful Dominique 
<br>Strauss-Kahn to paint Villepin and Sarkozy with the same 
<br>brush. 
<br>
<br>Sarkozy still the one to beat 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br>¶8. (C) Devedjian expressed certainty that Sarkozy would be 
<br>nominated to represent the governing party during the first 
<br>round of the 2007 presidential elections, and that he would 
<br>fare well enough to be one of two candidates in the second 
<br>round. He judged that Sarkozy's law-and-order reputation 
<br>would ensure that most far-right National Front (FN) 
<br>supporters would vote for Sarkozy in the second round, adding 
<br>that the FN would die out with the passing from the scene of 
<br>Le Pen. Devedjian acknowledged that Sarkozy, having first 
<br>consolidated his right wing, would need to do more to attract 
<br>centrist voters. He argued there was still time for this, 
<br>noting that Sarkozy had already come up with a number of 
<br>proposals that one normally would have expected to originate 
<br>on the left, for instance that immigrant permanent residents 
<br>be allowed to vote in municipal elections. 
<br>
<br>Segolene Royal the best on the left 
<br>----------------------------------- 
<br>¶9. (C) Asked whom he feared most among the Socialist 
<br>candidates, Devedjian named Segolene Royal, citing the 
<br>difficulty of running against an "image". (Comment: 
<br>Throughout the discussion, Devedjian stressed the importance 
<br>of running on projects for the future rather than past 
<br>accomplishments; no one, he said, won elections out of 
<br>gratitude for what they had done. Jospin, despite his record 
<br>of reducing unemployment, was proof of that. End comment.) 
<br>Fortunately, he said only half in jest, the PS would likely 
<br>refuse her the nomination and thereby spare Sarkozy the need 
<br>to defeat her himself ("they will take care of her for us"). 
<br>Devedjian said her candidacy could fall apart if she 
<br>continued to commit gaffes such as calling on regional 
<br>leaders to block government subsidies to mayors who apply the 
<br>CPE, which was against the law. Also making fun of her 
<br>repeatedly expressed admiration for British PM Tony Blair, 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00001681 003 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>Devedjian judged that Royal, known for her support for family 
<br>values and the work ethic, tended "to demobilize" the 
<br>far-left, which would hurt her chances in the second round, 
<br>since Communist Party supporters would not vote for her. 
<br>(Note: Devedjian said that, to win, a party has to mobilize 
<br>its own voters and demobilize those of the opposition.) 
<br>Asked who would be the candidate if Royal did not run, 
<br>Devedjian named former PM Lionel Jospin. But he predicted 
<br>that Jospin's age and history would tend to work against him. 
<br>(Comment: By contrast, Socialists often predict that voters 
<br>will react "with nervousness" to the super-charged Sarkozy 
<br>and gravitate toward a more reassuring figure. End comment.) 
<br>
<br>Sarkozy's plans if elected 
<br>-------------------------- 
<br>¶10. (C) Asked whether Sarkozy, if elected, would attempt to 
<br>push through a whole series of ambitious reforms in the early 
<br>months of his office, before French opposition to change 
<br>blocks further reforms, Devedjian said this would not be the 
<br>case. The one exception would be the judiciary, where he saw 
<br>a need for deep-reaching changes. He said he was also 
<br>interested in changing the constitution to abolish article 
<br>49.3 and reduce or abolish the possibilities for censure of 
<br>dissolution or the parliament. He believed a move to either 
<br>a more presidential (with the U.S. as model) or parliamentary 
<br>system (as in the UK) could be accomplished by amending the 
<br>existing constitution. 
<br>
<br>Devedjian's plans 
<br>----------------- 
<br>¶11. (SBU) Devedjian said he would expect to be a part of a 
<br>Sarkozy government, but he refused to speculate in what 
<br>capacity, although he subsequently launched into a discussion 
<br>of needed judicial reforms. (Note: Pundits predict Sarkozy 
<br>would name him as Justice Minister.) In departing, he 
<br>recalled warmly his February 3 meeting with EUR PDAS Volker 
<br>and Pol M/C (reftel). 
<br>
<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br>¶12. (C) Devedjian was friendly and animated, and in no hurry 
<br>to leave. Sarkozy's circle has come to the conclusion that 
<br>Villepin is now effectively finished as a potential 
<br>presidential candidate, even though this clearly also 
<br>represents wishful thinking on their part. Noteworthy was 
<br>Devedjian's judgment that the CPE may yet prove to be a major 
<br>test for the government, which contradicts the perception of 
<br>many that opposition to the CPE has not reached crisis 
<br>proportions. We'll know more following the March 18 
<br>demonstrations.
