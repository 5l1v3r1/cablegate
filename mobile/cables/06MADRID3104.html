<br>Classified By: DCM Hugo Llorens; reason 1.4 (D)
<br>
<br>¶1. (U) The Mallorcan "Free Association of Attorneys" and a
<br>group of Mallorcan professionals filed a motion calling upon
<br>National Court Judge Ismael Moreno to name 13 presumed USG
<br>officials as suspects in connection with the transit of a CIA
<br>flight that stopped in Palma de Mallorca in January 2004.
<br>The attorney's association and the Mallorcan professionals
<br>are the plaintiffs in a suit alleging torture, kidnapping,
<br>and illegal detention on the part of the CIA (Refs A, B, and
<br>C). (NOTE: Under Spanish law, an association of individuals
<br>can file charges against a defendant in a criminal case even
<br>if they were not directly affected by the actions of the
<br>defendant. For example, the "Association of Victims of
<br>Terrorism" has routinely used this mechanism to press charges
<br>against figures connected to ETA terrorist acts. END NOTE).
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) The plaintiffs drew the names from a report prepared
<br>by Spain's Civil Guard in 2005 regarding the occupants of a
<br>Boeing 737 with tail number N313P. The Civil Guard
<br>investigation was requested by the local court in Mallorca
<br>where the plaintiffs originally filed their case. The
<br>plaintiffs claim that this particular aircraft participated
<br>in the extraordinary rendition of German national Khaled el
<br>Masri in Macedonia after departing from Spanish territory.
<br>The names of the alleged occupants include:
<br>
<br>- James Fairing
<br>- Jason Franklin
<br>- Michael Grady
<br>- Lyle Edgard Lumsden III
<br>- Eric Fair
<br>- Bryam Charles
<br>- Kirk James Bird
<br>- Walter Richard Gressbore
<br>- Patricia Rilroy
<br>- Jane Payne
<br>- James O'Hale
<br>- John Decker
<br>- Hector Lorenzo
<br>
<br>¶3. (U) Press reports indicate that at least five of the
<br>persons named in the suit held U.S. diplomatic passports. In
<br>order for the plaintiff's demand to proceed, it must be
<br>supported by National Court Prosecutor Vicente Gonzalez Mota
<br>and approved by Judge Moreno. Gonzalez has not yet indicated
<br>whether he will support the plaintiff's request. He and
<br>Judge Moreno previously denied plaintiff's demands that the
<br>National Court request a report on the CIA flights from the
<br>U.S. Embassy in Madrid or other USG authorities. However,
<br>Judge Moreno has already entered into evidence the October 9
<br>testimony of Khaled el Masri as well as telephone logs from
<br>the Gran Melia Victoria hotel and the Marriot Son Antem in
<br>Palma de Mallorca where the crew of the aircraft in question
<br>stayed during their stopovers in Mallorca. (NOTE: el Masri
<br>testified before the National Court that he was kidnapped and
<br>tortured by the CIA for five months in 2004, but acknowledged
<br>that could not identify the individuals who transported him
<br>from Macedonia to Afghanistan, nor could he demonstrate that
<br>the aircraft that transported him was the same the same
<br>aircraft identified in the Mallorca suit. END NOTE). The
<br>National Court has also requested the testimony of
<br>prosecutors from Milan and Munich regarding the kidnapping of
<br>el Masri in Macedonia and Egyptian national Abu Omar in
<br>Italy.
<br>
<br>//COMMENT//
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) It is possible that this case could eventually result
<br>in an official request to the USG by the National Court for
<br>information related to this aircraft and the personnel on the
<br>aircraft. While the Spanish Government has maintained that
<br>no crimes were committed in Spanish territory, the Spanish
<br>courts, including Judge Moreno, have asserted universal
<br>jurisdiction in cases involving torture, including in third
<br>countries. The National Court Prosecutor in this case,
<br>Vicente Gonzalez, is well known to us as Spain's liaison to
<br>the Embassy for the work of the Bilateral Counter Terrorism
<br>Experts Working Group. We find him to be an engaging and
<br>helpful colleague and anticipate that he will be sensitive to
<br>the Spanish Government's preference that this case not
<br>proceed. However, we have already seen in similar cases that
<br>Spanish judges fiercely guard their independence and are
<br>willing to break new ground on issues of jurisdiction. If
<br>Judge Moreno were to determine that there was sufficient
<br>
<br>MADRID 00003104 002.2 OF 002
<br>
<br>
<br>evidence that a crime had been committed and that
<br>perpetrators could be identified, he would forward the case
<br>to a panel of trial judges. We will continue to track and
<br>report on developments in this case.
