<br>SUBJECT: SPAIN: CHIEF PROSECUTOR FORCED TO QUIT 
<br>
<br>¶1. (U) Attorney General Candido Conde Pumpido forced the 
<br>Chief Prosecutor of Spain's National Court, Eduardo 
<br>Fungairino, to step down for alleged mismanagement of 
<br>terrorism cases under his supervision. Fungairino, a 
<br>highly-respected 26-year veteran of the National Court, will 
<br>move to a position with the Supreme Court and retain a role 
<br>in terrorism cases. Fungairino's deputy, Jesus Santos, will 
<br>take over duties as Chief Prosecutor, at least on until a 
<br>successor is named. Conde Pumpido remonstrated Fungairino 
<br>for failing to secure Supreme Court confirmation of the 
<br>sentences of al-Qa'ida members convicted in September 2005 
<br>(thus allowing two terrorists to exit prison after having 
<br>served only half of their sentences) and for failing to push 
<br>for the completion of the 2004 Madrid train bombing 
<br>investigation. However, Fungairino's supporters claim that 
<br>the Zapatero government removed Fungairino because of his 
<br>strong opposition to a negotiated settlement with ETA, 
<br>negotiations that may require the cooperation of the National 
<br>Prosecutor's office. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) The story immediately developed political overtones, 
<br>with the Socialist-leaning "El Pais" running lengthy 
<br>descriptions of Fungairino's failings and incompetence and 
<br>serving as a platform for Conde Pumpido's version of events. 
<br>Conde Pumpido accused Fungairino of failing to consult with 
<br>colleagues and of dominating judicial relations with the U.S. 
<br>Department of Justice and with EU counterparts. The centrist 
<br>"El Mundo," which is strongly anti-ETA, ran a headline 
<br>declaring that Fungairino was a removed for impeding 
<br>government negotiations with ETA. "El Mundo" suggested that 
<br>Conde Pumpido decided to dismiss Fungairino because he had 
<br>blocked the banned ETA front group Batasuna from holding a 
<br>public meeting, despite hints from Zapatero that such a 
<br>meeting might be allowed in the interest of steering ETA 
<br>towards the political arena. The opposition Popular Party 
<br>and center-right judicial organizations rose to Fungairino's 
<br>defense, while center-left groups and Basque nationalist 
<br>organizations hailed the dismissal. 
<br>
<br>//EARLY RELEASE OF CONVICTED TERRORISTS// 
<br>
<br>¶3. (U) The main failure cited by Conde Pumpido - the early 
<br>release of convicted terrorists - is troubling, but 
<br>responsibility for the issue rests with several actors. 
<br>Under Spanish law, a detainee must be released after serving 
<br>half their maximum prison term if the sentences have not been 
<br>confirmed by the Supreme Court. The problem in this instance 
<br>is that many of the detainees in the Barakat Yarkas case were 
<br>held in pre-trial detention for nearly four years, time that 
<br>counts towards their sentences. Since many of those 
<br>convicted received jail terms of eight or fewer years (see 
<br>full listing in para 5), the half-way point came nearly 
<br>immediately after their September 2005 convictions, giving 
<br>the notoriously slow Spanish legal system little time to win 
<br>confirmation of the convictions by the Supreme Court. It was 
<br>up to both the Prosecutor's office and the Supreme Court to 
<br>shuttle the cases through, and they failed to do so in time 
<br>to prevent the release of two al-Qa'ida cell members. The 
<br>government is expected to move quickly now to prevent further 
<br>releases. 
<br>
<br>//COMMENT// 
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) The Embassy has enjoyed a close, collaborative 
<br>relationship with Fungairino for many years. While it is 
<br>true that he sometimes seemed to have difficulty delegating 
<br>responsibility, he was also seen as a key leader by many 
<br>Spanish prosecutors and a brilliant legal strategist. It 
<br>appears that his personal and political differences with 
<br>Conde Pumpido were the main cause of his removal, though the 
<br>inability to prevent the early release of the terrorist 
<br>convicts is difficult to defend. Regardless of the political 
<br>motives surrounding Fungairino's removal, his departure will 
<br>hurt U.S.-Spain judicial cooperation, at least in the short 
<br>term. Fungairino was a devoted anti-terrorism activist who 
<br>pursued close cooperation with the USG and with EU allies in 
<br>terrorism cases. One piece of good news is that Fungairino 
<br>will reportedly remain a member of the U.S.-Spain Bilateral 
<br>Counterterrorism Experts Working Group, where he has played a 
<br>positive role in smoothing over conflicts generated by 
<br>differences in the U.S. and Spanish judicial systems. Also, 
<br>Jesus Santos, Fungairino's temporary replacement, is well and 
<br>favorably known to the Embassy. However, this does not 
<br>outweigh the loss of so valuable an interlocutor in the 
<br>National Prosecutor's office.
