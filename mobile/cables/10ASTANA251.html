<br>general petraeus
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Richard E. Hoagland, 1.4 (b), (d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) General Petraeus, on behalf of Ambassador
<br>Hoagland, and the Department of Defense and Embassy Astana
<br>country teams, we extend a warm welcome on the occasion of
<br>your upcoming visit to Astana, Kazakhstan.
<br>
<br>Visit overview
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) The Office of the Defense Attache and your staff are
<br>working toward finalizing your visit itinerary. You are
<br>scheduled to arrive in Astana the evening of March 9, and are
<br>scheduled to depart the morning of March 10. This visit will
<br>further strengthen an already strong bilateral relationship
<br>in support of our strategic interests. On March 10, we are
<br>working to schedule meetings with the President, Minister of
<br>Defense, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the National
<br>Security Council.
<br>
<br>Domestic political perspective
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) While the Government of Kazakhstan articulates a
<br>strategic vision of a democratic society, it has lagged on
<br>the implementation front. The leadership remains resistant
<br>to competitive political processes, and the situation is
<br>complicated by the fact that President Nazarbayev is
<br>extraordinarily popular, while the opposition is weak,
<br>fractured, and comprised principally of former Nazarbayev
<br>loyalists who fell out of favor. In May 2007, significant
<br>amendments were adopted to Kazakhstan's constitution which
<br>were touted as strengthening parliament, but also removed
<br>terms limits on Nazarbayev. In parliamentary elections held
<br>in August 2007, Nazarbayev's Nur Otan party officially
<br>received 88 percent of the vote and took all the seats in
<br>parliament, which OSCE observers concluded did not meet OSCE
<br>standards. On a positive note, President Nazarbayev has
<br>taken positive steps that could facilitate a transition to a
<br>more democratic system in the long term. His Bolashak
<br>program provides scholarships for several thousand
<br>Kazakhstanis to receive higher education abroad, mostly in
<br>the West, where they absorb Western ideas and values.
<br>Additionally, Nazarbayev has brought into government service
<br>a new generation of young, ambitious bureaucrats ) many of
<br>whom studied in the West through Bolashak or U.S.
<br>Government-sponsored programs.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) When Kazakhstan was selected as 2010 OSCE chairman at
<br>the November 2007 OSCE Madrid OSCE Ministerial meeting,
<br>Foreign Minister Tazhin publicly committed that his
<br>government would amend Kazakhstan,s election, political
<br>party, and media laws in accordance with OSCE and Office of
<br>Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR)
<br>recommendations. (NOTE: Tazhin also promised that as OSCE
<br>chairman, Kazakhstan would support the OSCE's "human
<br>dimension" and preserve ODIHR,s mandate. END NOTE). The
<br>amendments were finally signed into law in February 2009.
<br>While key civil society leaders were disappointed that the
<br>new legislation did not go further, we consider them to be
<br>steps in the right direction, and will continue pressing for
<br>further reforms. While Kazakhstan prides itself on its
<br>religious tolerance, parliament passed legislation in late
<br>2008 which would have restricted the religious freedom of
<br>minority religious groups not traditional to Kazakhstan.
<br>Rather than sign the legislation, President Nazarbayev sent
<br>it for review to the Constitutional Council (Court), which
<br>ultimately declared the legislation to be unconstitutional.
<br>On July 10, Nazarbayev signed into law Internet legislation
<br>that provides a legal basis for the government to shut down
<br>and block websites whose content allegedly violates the
<br>country,s laws. This appears to be a step in the wrong
<br>direction at a time when the Kazakhstan,s record on
<br>democracy and human rights is in the spotlight because of its
<br>impending OSCE chairmanship. The legislation likely
<br>originated from the government,s desire to be able to
<br>
<br>Astana 00000251 002 of 014
<br>
<br>
<br>readily block access to web postings from Rakhat Aliyev,
<br>Nazarbayev,s ex-son-in-law, who, from his self-imposed exile
<br>in Austria, has put embarrassing materials and articles about
<br>Nazarbayev on various Internet sites. We have expressed our
<br>disappointment that the legislation was enacted, and have
<br>urged the government to implement it in a manner consistent
<br>with Kazakhstan,s OSCE commitments on freedom of speech and
<br>freedom of the press.
<br>
<br>International political perspective
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) President Nazarbayev carefully balances Kazakhstan,s
<br>relations with Russia, China, the United States and the EU )
<br>what is termed a &multi-vector8 foreign policy. The
<br>Kazakhstanis consider Russia their most important
<br>international partner, and Russia,s influence is
<br>unparalleled in Kazakhstan due to long historical ties,
<br>Kazakhstan,s large ethnic Russian population, and the
<br>predominance here of the Russian language ) which means most
<br>Kazakhstanis obtain their news from Russian,s broadcast and
<br>print media. Kazakhstan,s close relationship with the
<br>United States serves as an essential counterweight,
<br>reinforcing Kazakhstan,s sovereignty and independence and
<br>helping it stave off pressure from both its giant neighbors
<br>) Russia to the north and China to the east. For the
<br>Kazakhstanis, high-level interactions with the United States
<br>are not only substantively important, but also symbolically
<br>important, sending a signal to Moscow that we remain closely
<br>engaged despite Moscow,s assertion that Central Asia is its
<br>&privileged sphere of influence.8
<br>
<br>Economic perspective
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Kazakhstan is the region's economic powerhouse, with
<br>an economy larger than that of all the other Central Asian
<br>states combined. Economic growth averaged over 9% a year
<br>during 2005-07, before dropping to 3% in 2008 with the onset
<br>of the global financial crisis. The contracted by about 2%
<br>in 2009, but positive growth is again expected in 2010.
<br>While the country's economic success is partly due to its
<br>fortuitous natural resource deposits, astute macroeconomic
<br>policies and extensive economic reforms have also played an
<br>important role. Kazakhstan has a modern banking and
<br>financial system, a well-endowed pension fund, and a
<br>transparent sovereign wealth fund with approximately $20
<br>billion in assets. The government has taken aggressive steps
<br>to tackle the domestic reverberations of the world economic
<br>crisis, allocating $21 billion to take equity stakes in
<br>private banks, prop up the construction and real-estate
<br>sectors, and support small- and medium-sized enterprises and
<br>agriculture. Kazakhstan,s long-run economic challenge is to
<br>diversify its economy away from reliance on the energy
<br>sector. In 2008, we launched a bilateral Private-Private
<br>Economic Partnership Initiative (PPEPI), which brings
<br>together the U.S. and Kazakhstani public and private sectors
<br>to make policy recommendations on improving the country,s
<br>business climate and reducing other barriers to non-energy
<br>investment. On a less promising note, the Kazakhstanis
<br>announced in June that they would suspend their bilateral
<br>negotiations to accede to the World Trade Organization (WTO)
<br>and on January 1, Kazakhstan joined a customs union with
<br>Russia and Belarus. We have informed Kazakhstan that there
<br>is, in fact, no mechanism allowing a customs union to accede
<br>to the WTO without its member states doing so individually.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) U.S. and Kazakhstani strategic interests are largely
<br>aligned on the development of Kazakhstan,s vast energy
<br>resources. Both sides agree that U.S. and other Western
<br>companies must continue playing a lead role in Kazakhstan,s
<br>energy exploration and production projects, and that
<br>diversification of transport routes will bolster
<br>Kazakhstan,s sovereignty and enable it to capture the
<br>maximum benefits of its energy and wealth. Kazakhstan
<br>produced 88 million tons of oil in 2009 (approximately 1.5
<br>
<br>Astana 00000251 003 of 014
<br>
<br>
<br>million barrels per day), and is expected to become one of
<br>the world,s top ten crude exporters soon after 2015. While
<br>the country also has significant gas reserves (1.5 trillion
<br>cubic meters is a low-end estimate), current gas exports are
<br>very limited for now, in part because gas is being reinjected
<br>to maximize crude output. U.S. companies (ExxonMobil,
<br>Chevron, and ConocoPhillips) have significant ownership
<br>stakes in Kazakhstan,s three major hydrocarbon projects,
<br>including Kashagan, the world,s largest oil field discovery
<br>since Alaska,s North Slope. In June 2009, ConocoPhillips
<br>signed a contract to explore and develop the offshore N
<br>Block, estimated to contain 2.13 billion recoverable barrels
<br>of oil. China has recently increased its investment in
<br>Kazakhstan,s energy sector, and through the state-owned
<br>China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) now controls
<br>approximately 20% of Kazakhstan,s total oil production.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) With major crude production increases on the horizon,
<br>Kazakhstan must develop additional transport routes to bring
<br>its crude to market. Currently, most of Kazakhstan,s crude
<br>is exported via Russia, though some exports flow east to
<br>China, west across the Caspian through Azerbaijan, and south
<br>across the Caspian to Iran. We are focused on helping the
<br>Kazakhstanis implement the Kazakhstan-Caspian Transportation
<br>System (KCTS), which envisions a &virtual pipeline8 of
<br>tankers transporting large volumes of crude from
<br>Kazakhstan,s Caspian coast to Baku, from where it will flow
<br>onward to market through Georgia, including through the
<br>Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline. While a trans-Caspian
<br>crude pipeline might be a cheaper long-term transport option,
<br>the Kazakhstanis maintain that an agreement on Caspian
<br>delimitation among the five Caspian littoral states is a
<br>prerequisite, politically if not legally, for moving forward
<br>on the construction of such a pipeline.
<br>
<br>¶9. (SBU) One issue that is certain to be at the center of
<br>discussion for years to come is water management. Reviving
<br>the northern portion of the Aral Sea, which Kazakhstan
<br>controls, has been a resounding success. A greater priority
<br>is ensuring continued access to water for public and
<br>agricultural use. As most of Kazakhstan's rivers have
<br>headwaters outside of the country, Kazakhstan remains
<br>somewhat vulnerable to developments in upstream countries.
<br>For the moment this is not a problem as glacial melt has made
<br>up the distance in quantity versus demand. But the long-term
<br>issue is that Kazakhstan is drawing against a bank account
<br>that cannot be easily replenished. Anecdotally we have been
<br>told that the Ishim River (the river that flows through
<br>Astana has its headwaters in China) has decreased by one
<br>meter over the past few years due to increased upstream use
<br>in China. In addition to securing an adequate quantity of
<br>water, Kazakhstan also remains concerned about water quality.
<br>There is also concern that Lake Balkash, the 16th largest
<br>lake in the world, might be endangered by China,s up-stream
<br>water usage.
<br>
<br>Regional influence and support
<br>
<br>¶10. (SBU) Kazakhstan has also expressed its eagerness to
<br>play an enhanced role in achieving regional integration.
<br>President Nazarbayev continues to raise the subject of a
<br>Central Asian union with a common market. Kazakhstan is
<br>already a significant economic force in the region ) it is
<br>the largest foreign investor in Kyrgyzstan and in Georgia,
<br>for example. While progress has been slow, the Kazakhstanis
<br>are continuing to seek opportunities for investment in
<br>Afghanistan.
<br>
<br>Csto and sco
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Kazakhstan's involvement in the Russian-led
<br>Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) is a natural
<br>extension of its historical relationship with Russia, as well
<br>as its current Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)
<br>
<br>Astana 00000251 004 of 014
<br>
<br>
<br>involvement and mutual security ties with Former Soviet Union
<br>(FSU) nations. Its membership in the Shanghai Cooperation
<br>Organization (SCO) provides a means to balance its foreign
<br>policy and not show favoritism unless absolutely necessary.
<br>CSTO participation penetrates the political, economic and
<br>military spheres, but actual contributions to the CSTO appear
<br>to be more political than substantive. The CSTO mechanism
<br>provides a means for Kazakhstan to stay connected to Russia
<br>on issues of mutual concern (air defense, counter-terrorism,
<br>etc...), but without the danger of getting too close. At the
<br>CSTO,s 2008 summit in Moscow, the Government of Russia
<br>pressured the CSTO partners to recognize South Ossetian and
<br>Abkhazian independence and to make strong statements about
<br>Georgia,s responsibility for the current conflict, however,
<br>Kazakhstan and the other CSTO members did not cede to Russian
<br>pressure. With regard to the SCO, Kazakhstan was surprised
<br>at the vehemence of Russia and China in insisting upon an
<br>anti-U.S. in Central Asia statement in the 2006 summit joint
<br>statement. Kazakhstan remains "proud" of the fact that they
<br>prevented a similar clause from appearing again. SCO
<br>activity remains minimal in Kazakhstan with the government
<br>remaining leery of its eastern neighbor.
<br>
<br>Military/defense perspective
<br>
<br>Ministry of defense
<br>
<br>¶12. (S) Minister of Defense: Kazakhstan,s former
<br>Ambassador to Russia, Adilbek Dzhaksybekov, was appointed as
<br>the new Defense Minister on 24 June 2009. All indications
<br>appear that Minister Dzhaksybekov is a pragmatist and
<br>supports cooperation with a variety of nations that is in the
<br>best interests of the Ministry of Defense and the
<br>modernization and transformation of the Kazakhstan Armed
<br>Forces.
<br>
<br>¶13. (S) Chief of Defense: First Deputy Minister General
<br>Mukhtar Altynbayev, previously Minister of Defense, thrice
<br>removed, continues to serve as Kazakhstan,s Chief of
<br>Defense. Relatively inconsequential as the Chief of Defense
<br>and generally a neutral party who has neither a positive nor
<br>negative impact on our bilateral relationship, he is reported
<br>to oppose the deployment of forces to Afghanistan.
<br>
<br>¶14. (S) Component Commanders: The Ground Forces Chief,
<br>General-Lieutenant Saken Zhasuzakov; Air Forces Chief,
<br>General-Major Alexandr Sorokin; and Chief of Naval Forces,
<br>Captain Zhandarbek Zhanzakov. Generally, the Component
<br>Commanders have so far proven to be inconsequential, as they
<br>remain relatively uninvolved in the sphere of U.S.-Kazakhstan
<br>security cooperation ) this is because the majority of our
<br>security cooperation does not impact forces under the
<br>component commanders, direct control.
<br>
<br>¶15. (S) Unequal Partnership: The MOD remains an
<br>under-funded ministry that has no policy-making authority.
<br>The simple fact is that the U.S. DOD-KZ MOD relationship is
<br>not one of equals. DOD has significant policy input in the
<br>USG, while the MOD appears to have almost none. In short,
<br>the KZ MOD is a supporting ministry, taking its direction
<br>from higher levels within the government. The U.S. has, on a
<br>number of occasions, successfully achieved its bilateral and
<br>regional goals by appealing to those closer to the center of
<br>power and using them to provide the MOD with marching orders.
<br>
<br>Military operations/support
<br>
<br>Iraq
<br>
<br>¶16. (SBU) Kazakhstan directly supported coalition efforts in
<br>Iraq from August 2003 through October 2008, most
<br>significantly by deploying a military engineering/explosive
<br>ordinance disposal (EOD) unit which cumulatively disposed of
<br>over 5 million pieces of unexploded ordnance. With the
<br>
<br>Astana 00000251 005 of 014
<br>
<br>
<br>reorganization of the coalition in Iraq, Kazakhstan completed
<br>its tenth rotation and redeployed its forces in their
<br>entirety in late October 2008.
<br>
<br>Afghanistan
<br>
<br>¶17. (S) The USG continues to solicit support for increased
<br>participation in international operations, and it appears
<br>that Kazakhstan may, in the near-term, deploy four to six
<br>staff officers to support ISAF HQ in Afghanistan, however,
<br>internal political discussions are ongoing and a decision has
<br>yet to be made. Of great concern to the Government is public
<br>opinion, which in general is opposed to a deployment to
<br>Afghanistan primarily because of misconceptions fostered by
<br>the Kazakh experience in Afghanistan during the 1980s Soviet
<br>occupation. Supporters of a deployment to Afghanistan within
<br>the Ministry of Defense look to increase Kazakhstan,s ISAF
<br>coalition contributions over time, specifically the future
<br>deployment of military medical personnel and EOD/Engineer
<br>assets, very possibly in support of the Afghan Engineer
<br>School located in Mazar-e-Sharif. These supporters consist
<br>primarily of the pro-western faction within the Ministry of
<br>Defense, xxxxxxxxxxxx, and understand the
<br>value of conducting real-world operations in terms of
<br>building political capital and capitalizing on deploying and
<br>training the force. Additionally, in 2008 the Government of
<br>Kazakhstan provided almost $3 million to Afghanistan
<br>primarily for infrastructure improvement and development, and
<br>is looking to provide additional funding. During a November
<br>22 visit to Kabul, State Secretary-Foreign Minister Kanat
<br>Saudabayev unveiled an assistance package, which included a
<br>proposal to provide free university education in Kazakhstan
<br>for up to 1,000 Afghan students over the period from
<br>2010-2018. The government has also offered to provide
<br>training to Afghan law enforcement officers at law
<br>enforcement training institutes in Kazakhstan. The
<br>Kazakhstanis hope to make Afghanistan a focus of their 2010
<br>OSCE chairmanship.
<br>
<br>Issues influencing expansion of kazakhstan's support for
<br>afghanistan
<br>
<br>Overflight expansion
<br>
<br>¶18. (S) In November 2009 we requested the expansion of the
<br>overflight agreement to include two North-South polar routes
<br>to/from Russia through Kazakhstan and eventually to
<br>Afghanistan via Diplomatic Note. This request has been
<br>unofficially declined and stated that a new agreement must be
<br>negotiated then ratified by parliament prior to entry into
<br>force. This process could take well over a year from
<br>negotiation to ratification, as exemplified by the German
<br>transit agreement which was negotiated from 2004-2007, signed
<br>in 2007, then ratified in 2008. This current impasse may
<br>very be the result of several influencing factors. It
<br>appears the Kazakhs are unhappy with being approached by the
<br>USG requesting additional air corridors after the USG
<br>negotiated an air transit agreement with Russia. The Kazakhs
<br>have told us in the past that they do not appreciate being
<br>treated like the little brother to Russia, and that the USG
<br>needs to notify the Government of Kazakhstan in good faith at
<br>the same time as discussions are ongoing with Russia. It is
<br>our belief the Government of Kazakhstan has been unwilling to
<br>approve additional overflight corridors as an addendum to our
<br>current overflight agreement via Diplomatic Note exchange
<br>because the USG negotiated with Russia prior to consulting
<br>with Kazakhstan. Further exacerbating this issue is likely
<br>the press coverage emphasizing the significance of Russia
<br>assisting U.S. efforts in Afghanistan, when the Kazakhs have
<br>been quietly doing so since 2001. The Kazakhs also likely
<br>consider the U.S. request as a fait accompli ) something
<br>that further aggravates the government.
<br>
<br>Transit of m-atvs and other wheeled vehicles
<br>
<br>Astana 00000251 006 of 014
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶19. (S) In October 2009 we requested the authorization to
<br>ship military and civilian wheeled vehicles to include MRAPs
<br>and M-ATVS along the NDN via Diplomatic Note. This request
<br>has also been unofficially declined and is likely tied to the
<br>issues outlined in this section of the scenesetter as well as
<br>the following. Information indicates that the National
<br>Security Committee (KNB) does not support the transit of
<br>M-ATVS or lethal cargo ) the excuse we have been given is
<br>that it exposes the Kazakhs to potential terrorist reprisals
<br>for supporting lethal cargo transit. This appears to be the
<br>top cover for declining the U.S. request and frankly a flimsy
<br>excuse given that the Germany-Kazakhstan air and ground
<br>bilateral transit agreement for lethal and non-lethal goods
<br>was ratified by the Kazakhstan Parliament in 2008. How does
<br>this not expose Kazakhstan to the same risks?
<br>
<br>Local procurement
<br>
<br>¶20. (S) The Government of Kazakhstan has become extremely
<br>frustrated at the perceived lack of U.S. forward movement to
<br>date in local procurement in over 13 months since the NDN
<br>informal agreement was approved by President Nazarbayev in
<br>December 2008. Local procurement provides the U.S. the
<br>opportunity to strengthen our strategic partnership and to
<br>capitalize on providing domestically-produced items for U.S.
<br>forces in Afghanistan. Opportunities abound for promoting
<br>the benefits associated with supporting the U.S. goals and
<br>specifically the NDN, while offering the cost-savings
<br>associated with the procurement of locally-produced products
<br>that meet and/or exceed our requirements. Local procurement
<br>was a major selling point for the Kazakhs, however, since the
<br>Government of Kazakhstan considers little to have so far been
<br>accomplished in this respect, it is likely that this is also
<br>a factor retarding the positive movement forward on securing
<br>an agreement for the transshipment of M-ATVs as well as the
<br>expansion of OEF overflight corridors. Additionally, the
<br>disparate nature of our logistics system is making this a
<br>challenging enterprise ) the responsibility for procuring
<br>various classes of supplies is dispersed amongst different
<br>government organizations. Although GSA and DLA have stepped
<br>up to the plate and are beginning to capitalize on local
<br>procurement opportunities, it would be in our best interests
<br>to coordinate all procurement efforts to maximize our
<br>effectiveness and efficiency to support this extremely
<br>important mission.
<br>
<br>Logistics hub/transit center offer
<br>
<br>¶21. (S) In March 2008 President Nazarbayev extended an offer
<br>of a logistics hub/transit center in Kazakhstan to the U.S.
<br>Ambassador to Kazakhstan. Since then the Government of
<br>Kazakhstan has been asking for a written request from the USG
<br>outlining our requirements. A written USG request is
<br>considered by the Kazakhs as the starting point for
<br>determining exactly what level of logistic hub/transit center
<br>the Kazakhs would possibly be willing to support. We have
<br>yet to submit a request or to officially take this offer off
<br>the table, and are periodically asked about our response to
<br>the offer. It appears to the Government of Kazakhstan that
<br>we are ignoring their offer, thereby, further aggravating the
<br>issues outlined in this section of the scenesetter.
<br>
<br>Cooperation with uzbekistan
<br>
<br>¶22. (S) The Government of Kazakhstan has stated with concern
<br>that our cooperation with Uzbekistan has increased while our
<br>cooperation with Kazakhstan, in their view, remains stagnant
<br>or is decreasing. The government has also indicated its
<br>frustration and lack of understanding why this would be the
<br>case since Kazakhstan has been and continues to be a reliable
<br>partner, both now and into the future. Whether or not this
<br>is the case, perception is reality, and the examples that are
<br>routinely mentioned are that Kazakhstan has been the first
<br>
<br>Astana 00000251 007 of 014
<br>
<br>
<br>Central Asian nation to authorize cost-free unlimited and
<br>unfettered overflights in support of OEF (2001), as well as
<br>an expansion to this agreement an opening of additional air
<br>corridors (2005); the first Central Asian nation to authorize
<br>aircraft diverts into Almaty airport in the event of an
<br>emergency; the first and only Central Asian nation to deploy
<br>forces to Iraq in support of OIF (2003-2008); the first
<br>Central Asian nation to authorize the shipment of non-lethal
<br>goods along the NDN (Dec 2008), little more than one month
<br>following General McNabb,s visit and official request; and
<br>the first Central Asian nation, and most likely the only,
<br>that will deploy forces into Afghanistan in support of ISAF
<br>sometime this year (most likely by June 2010).
<br>
<br>Overflight agreement
<br>
<br>¶23. (SBU) In support of OEF, the Government of Kazakhstan
<br>has granted more than 9,000 cost-free overflights since the
<br>agreement,s entry into force in 2001 and eventual
<br>parliamentary ratification in December 2008 ) this equates
<br>to an annual average of over 1000 U.S. military and DOD
<br>charter aircraft overflights per year. This agreement does
<br>not differentiate between types of cargo, allowing it to be
<br>used for the transport of lethal goods.
<br>
<br>Emergency divert agreement
<br>
<br>¶24. (SBU) In 2002, an emergency divert agreement with the
<br>Kazakhstan entered into force that allows aircraft bound for
<br>Manas the option of landing at Almaty or Astana International
<br>Airports in case of bad weather or emergency ) in excess of
<br>85 diverts have been supported under this agreement. In
<br>every case Kazakhstan has exceeded the expectations of the
<br>original agreement, however one of the limiting factors under
<br>the provisions of this agreement is the restriction which
<br>does not allow disembarkation of troops from the diverted
<br>aircraft. U.S. forces traveling on deployment orders usually
<br>do not have passports or visas and, therefore, cannot legally
<br>enter the country to stay at a hotel or be transported by
<br>alternate ground means to Manas. Should the Kazakhstani
<br>Government allow U.S. forces entry into Kazakhstan, USDAO has
<br>no mechanism in place to fund costs associated with
<br>transportation or lodging. Since the agreement,s entry into
<br>force, the USDAO has relocated from Almaty over 600 miles
<br>north to Astana and cannot react quickly to support incoming
<br>diverted aircraft.
<br>
<br>Northern distribution network (ndn)
<br>
<br>¶25. (SBU) As you are aware, President Nazarbayev approved
<br>the use of Kazakhstan,s commercial transport infrastructure
<br>to support the U.S. NDN for resupplying our forces in
<br>Afghanistan on 30 December 2008.
<br>
<br>¶26. (C) As background to previous non-U.S. transit
<br>agreements, NATO has been limited to one option ) the
<br>transport of non-lethal supplies through Russia, Kazakhstan
<br>and Uzbekistan ) and finally secured a written agreement to
<br>resupply forces in Afghanistan in late January 2010. Of note
<br>is that the Government of Kazakhstan was extremely unhappy
<br>that NATO sought permission of its big brother, to the
<br>north before opening discussions with the Kazakhstanis ) the
<br>government indicated negotiations should have occurred in
<br>parallel rather than in serial. The German Government
<br>negotiated an official government-to-government agreement
<br>with Kazakhstan for the ground and air transit of both lethal
<br>and non-lethal supplies destined for Afghanistan, which took
<br>3 years to negotiate (2004-2007) and one year for
<br>parliamentary ratification before the agreement entered into
<br>force in 2008 ) a four year process. The Germans have yet
<br>to execute the transit of lethal goods via ground means,
<br>something we will monitor in the event the U.S. decides to
<br>expand its current agreement to include the transit of lethal
<br>supplies.
<br>
<br>Astana 00000251 008 of 014
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶27. (S) Additionally, it continues to be in our best
<br>interests to use all available transit routes, to include
<br>Russia. Should we purposely choose to bypass Russia, then it
<br>is likely that Russia would pressure the Government of
<br>Kazakhstan to not allow supplies to transit Kazakhstan. It
<br>is our strong belief that including Russia as part of the NDN
<br>is a win-win situation and provides the U.S. an alternate
<br>route to resupply our forces in Afghanistan, however, we must
<br>remain aware that Russia could attempt to manipulate and gain
<br>exclusive control of the flow of supplies across its
<br>territory by undermining our efforts to expand our options
<br>with other nations.
<br>
<br>Aviation fuel
<br>
<br>¶28. (C) Since Kazakhstan has a limited refining capability,
<br>it imports most of its aviation fuel from Russia. Some of
<br>this fuel is in turn sold to Manas Transit Center,
<br>Kyrgyzstan. In this way, Russia indirectly provides fuel for
<br>Manas Transit Center and OEF operations.
<br>
<br>¶29. (SBU) In response to the Georgian-Russian conflict,
<br>Kazakhstan provided 165 tons of humanitarian aid to the
<br>Government of Georgia consisting of food, medicine and
<br>medical equipment worth approximately $460K. The Kazakhstani
<br>government has also made strong statements in support of UN
<br>resolutions sanctioning Iran and North Korea.
<br>
<br>Non-proliferation issues
<br>
<br>¶30. (SBU) Kazakhstan sees itself as a strong partner in
<br>non-proliferation. Non-proliferation has been a cornerstone
<br>of the bilateral relationship since Kazakhstan's
<br>independence. With the collapse of the Soviet Union,
<br>Kazakhstan was left with the world's fourth largest nuclear
<br>arsenal. Nazarbayev's 1991 decision to give up Kazakhstan's
<br>nuclear arsenal was groundbreaking. Kazakhstan returned all
<br>tactical nuclear warheads to Russia by January 1992, and all
<br>strategic nuclear warheads by April 1995. Through the
<br>Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Program the
<br>U.S. assisted Kazakhstan with the destruction of bombers,
<br>silos, and related ICBM infrastructure and delivery systems.
<br>
<br>¶31. (S) While the U.S.-Kazakhstan non-proliferation
<br>relationship seems to be solid on the surface, at working
<br>levels, the U.S. and Kazakhstani governments have encountered
<br>continuous implementation issues. The Umbrella Agreement
<br>amendment governing the CTR program, signed in December 2007,
<br>was finally ratified on 2 June 2009. Ratification is the
<br>first step to provide Kazakhstan with a legal basis to
<br>establish a mechanism to implement value added tax (VAT) and
<br>duty exemptions for imported equipment and services contracts
<br>through the CTR program. Taxation issues have festered
<br>unresolved since 2004, leading to frustration at high levels
<br>in Washington, both in the Executive and Legislative
<br>branches. There has, however, been a renewed commitment at
<br>the senior levels of the Government of Kazakhstan to resolve
<br>the taxation issues, yet we await the commitment to translate
<br>into reality.
<br>
<br>¶32. (S) Of all of the projects funded by the CTR
<br>appropriation, the most critical is a classified project to
<br>secure weapons-grade materials at the former Soviet nuclear
<br>weapons test site in Semipalatinsk. The project is
<br>tri-lateral, between Russia, Kazakhstan, and the United
<br>States, with the Russians providing the necessary data
<br>regarding material location and the United States providing
<br>funding to repatriate the material to Russia or secure it in
<br>situ. In addition to securing the materials at the site, DOD
<br>is pressing the Government of Kazakhstan to increase its
<br>security presence at the site (Ministry of Internal Affairs
<br>Special Troops), and has provided ground sensor and UAV
<br>technology that is used to assist Kazakhstan monitor the site
<br>
<br>Astana 00000251 009 of 014
<br>
<br>
<br>for trespassers.
<br>
<br>¶33. (SBU) In addition to the classified trilateral project
<br>in Semipalatinsk, the Department of Defense is currently
<br>implementing the Biological Threat Reduction Program, which
<br>supports Kazakhstan,s efforts to combat bioterrorism and
<br>prevent the proliferation of biological weapons technology,
<br>pathogens and expertise by strengthening its outbreak
<br>response and monitoring capabilities.
<br>
<br>¶34. (SBU) The Department of Energy also has several projects
<br>that are focused on securing nuclear materials, including a
<br>major project to decommission and store spent fuel from
<br>Kazakhstan,s BN-350 fast breeder reactor. Currently, OSD
<br>(NCB) has offered assistance in the form security and
<br>consequence management seminars, a table top exercise and of
<br>a field exercise to test the readiness incident response
<br>forces and Ministry of Internal Affairs Special Troops,
<br>which provides security escort for fuel shipments between
<br>Aktau (where the reactor is located) and the Semipalatinsk
<br>Test Site, where the fuel will be kept in long-term storage.
<br>The Special Troops also have a rapid response force at the
<br>storage site. The Government of Kazakhstan is considering
<br>the offered exercise assistance.
<br>
<br>¶35. (SBU) The Department of State funds additional
<br>nonproliferation projects implemented by the International
<br>Science and Technology Center (ISTC). State also takes a
<br>leading role in the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear
<br>Weapons Terrorism, in which Kazakhstan participates.
<br>
<br>Security assistance and engagement overview
<br>
<br>¶36. (S) We harbor no illusions to the contrary ) Russia is
<br>and will remain Kazakhstan's number one security partner.
<br>Kazakhstan MoD will partner with the U.S. to modernize, but
<br>we will need your help in rebuilding trust in the US Security
<br>Assistance (SA) apparatus. We have the long-term goal of
<br>transforming the Kazakhstan Armed Forces into a deployable
<br>force which not only can adequately protect national
<br>sovereignty, but also becomes an agent of democratic reform
<br>and rule of law within Kazakhstan. We have identified three
<br>areas where U.S.-Kazakh interests overlap: Defense Reform
<br>(both doctrine and equipment), security of the ungoverned
<br>spaces of the Caspian Sea Basin and Southern Kazakhstan, and
<br>the development of a deployable Peace Support Operations
<br>(PSO) capability to support multilateral UN-sanctioned
<br>operations. We have seen progress over the past few years,
<br>but lack of fiscal commitment, especially in the Huey II
<br>helicopter program, continues to undermine U.S. credibility,
<br>resulting in Kazakhstan,s lack of enthusiasm to commit
<br>national funds to modernization and transformation. We
<br>continue to work with OSD, CENTCOM, DSCA and the Military
<br>Services Security Assistance Commands to overcome these
<br>obstacles and to develop and execute solutions to the myriad
<br>of problems on the Huey II. The bottom line is that the
<br>United States, credibility and reliability are at stake with
<br>regard to our SA endeavors.
<br>
<br>Hmmwvs
<br>
<br>¶37. (SBU) Kazakhstan HMMWV fleet currently includes 114
<br>vehicles (45 up-armored vehicles, the rest being primarily
<br>unarmored or ambulances). KAZBRIG uses the HMMWVs for
<br>training peacekeepers and is expected to deploy with them as
<br>part of a future PSO. MOD has made a commitment to the
<br>sustainment of the HMMWVs through the development of the
<br>&Asia HMMWV Center8 and a Unit Maintenance facility at
<br>KAZBRIG. The initial success of the HMMWV program in
<br>Kazakhstan led to the MOD requesting eight Huey II
<br>helicopters (highly modified UH-1Hs) through the FMF program.
<br>
<br>
<br>Huey ii helicopters
<br>
<br>Astana 00000251 010 of 014
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶38. (SBU) This program failed to meet the original goal of
<br>achieving full operational capability with an eight-aircraft
<br>unit by 2010, primarily due to underfunding. Movement
<br>forward will require over $55M in funding and more deliberate
<br>attention from U.S. Army Security Assistance Command
<br>responsible for the program. The U.S. delivered the first
<br>two of eight Excess Defense Article (EDA) Huey IIs in
<br>November 2007, and an agreement for a third has been signed
<br>lat this year due to Kazakhstan,s FMF funding being
<br>decreased while refurbishment costs continue to rise.
<br>Currently, at over $8M per aircraft for refurbishment and
<br>delivery alone, plus the additional resources needed for
<br>associated support equipment and training, Kazakhstan needs
<br>over $55M to provide the remaining five aircraft. In
<br>addition to the funding issue, the Huey II operational
<br>readiness rates have hovered at zero since in July 2008 due
<br>to shortages of ground maintenance equipment, adequate spare
<br>parts and publications. A prime example of the issues at
<br>hand - when the Huey II s required routine 150 flight hour
<br>service, the initial parts package did not include all needed
<br>parts for the service, but did include over $160K in
<br>non-required or non-Huey II parts. As a short-term fix, we
<br>are working with the Kazakhstani MOD and U.S. Army case
<br>managers to coordinate contractor maintenance oversight and
<br>provide the parts and equipment necessary to complete these
<br>basic periodic inspections, while concurrently staffing
<br>U.S.-required airworthiness release to allow U.S. maintainers
<br>and pilots to train MOD personnel onboard their aircraft. We
<br>are working to find alternative means to fund the Huey II
<br>program including an FY09 1206 proposal which was disapproved
<br>within DOD and a recent CENTCOM initiated supplemental
<br>funding request which is currently making its way through the
<br>DOD pipeline. CENTCOM and US Embassy staffs have developed a
<br>supplemental funding request for $60 million to complete the
<br>Kazakhstan Huey-II helicopter program. This request is
<br>currently stalled at OSD due to OSD Comptroller
<br>non-concurrence. The delivery of the two helicopters was a
<br>major news item in Kazakhstan that reached the attention of
<br>President Nazarbayev - the death of this program will surely
<br>reach him as well. Additionally, should we prove unreliable
<br>then there exists little reason for Kazakhstan to commit
<br>national funds for the procurement/refurbishment of C130s )
<br>the third pillar of the HMMWV- Huey II -C130 triad.
<br>
<br>¶39. (C) The reduction in funding combined with an unreliable
<br>and unresponsive SA system damage U.S. reliability and
<br>credibility, as well as the credibility of pro-U.S./Western
<br>allies within the MOD. The anti-U.S./pro-Russian faction
<br>within MOD will use this to undercut our supporters within
<br>the government ) and do not require an active role but
<br>passively point to the unreliability of the U.S. as a
<br>security partner. xxxxxxxxxxxx in order to show the
<br>skeptics that the U.S. is a credible and reliable partner,
<br>U.S./Western technology is superior and Kazakhstan,s
<br>soldiers can be trained to use and sustain U.S./Western
<br>equipment.
<br>
<br>Defense transportation system (dts)
<br>
<br>¶40. (SBU) FMS and 1206 equipment and spare parts shipments
<br>are routinely delayed due to shortfalls or inaccuracies in
<br>transport documentation. Lack of documentation from shippers
<br>has contributed not only to significant delays in equipment
<br>delivery, but has cost the Kazakhstani MOD over $50K in
<br>unprogrammed impound storage fees in the last 18 months.
<br>Kazakhstan does not have its own freight forwarder, and is
<br>solely reliant on FMF-funded DTS for equipment delivery )
<br>the negative impact on our credibility is further exacerbated
<br>when we cannot deliver U.S. equipment using our own
<br>transportation system in an efficient and timely manner. We
<br>still encourage Kazakhstan to hire a freight forwarder, but
<br>
<br>Astana 00000251 011 of 014
<br>
<br>
<br>even if it did so, we are required to use DTS for U.S.
<br>equipment delivered under some special programs like 1206 )
<br>so a fix to DTS is still essential. We are working with
<br>DSCA, TRANSCOM and the military services, security
<br>assistance organizations to address these systemic shortfalls.
<br>
<br>C-130s
<br>
<br>¶41. (SBU) The Ministry of Defense requested six EDA C-130s
<br>in 2006, but Congress only recently released EDA C-130s. The
<br>C-130s could provide a valuable capstone for our bilateral
<br>security cooperation, should we be able to overcome systemic
<br>shortcomings. xxxxxxxxxxxx USAF (Jun 09) and USN (Dec 09) provided
<br>the Kazakh MOD with Pricing and Availability (P&A) data for
<br>the procurement/refurbishment of six EDA C-130. Current
<br>estimates for this program are between $210 and $265M )
<br>purchase will require the commitment of Kazakh national
<br>funds, since this far exceeds available or anticipated FMF.
<br>While the Ministry of Defense indicated national funds are
<br>available in 2011, it must soon refine its request to start
<br>long lead processes such as congressional notification, spare
<br>parts procurement, and the scheduling of training. This may
<br>allow the U.S. system the opportunity to meet the MOD
<br>requested initial operational capability date of 2013.
<br>Kazakhstan currently has a C- rating under the Interagency
<br>Country Risk Assessment methodology, which does not allow DOD
<br>to schedule a payment plan with Kazakhstan. The Department
<br>of Treasury and the Department of State have expressed
<br>opposition to an improvement in the rating, for reasons
<br>related to risk in the financial sector.
<br>
<br>Military-to-military (m2m) cooperation
<br>
<br>¶42. (SBU) The CENTCOM M2M contact plan has grown to 145
<br>events in FY09 (this figure does not include FMF, IMET,
<br>Peacekeeping or 1206 projects), and we expect to conduct
<br>approximately 130 events in FY10. Despite the slight
<br>decrease in quantity, there has also been a significant
<br>increase in the quality of events ) the subject matter is
<br>increasingly complex and comprehensive, and event
<br>preparations are more professionally planned, coordinated and
<br>executed. Kazakhstan has asked for U.S. assistance through
<br>M2M activities in a number of key areas that stand to have a
<br>long-term impact on the modernization and transformation of
<br>their military, to include the development of national
<br>military doctrine, curriculum and faculty development for
<br>their Professional Military Education (PME) institutions, and
<br>interoperability through acquisition of equipment and TTP
<br>implementation.
<br>
<br>Kazbrig evolution
<br>
<br>¶43. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx Originally,
<br>plans were to have most of KAZBRIG professionally-manned,
<br>equipped, and trained by the end of 2009, however, little to
<br>no progress in the sphere of professionalization has occurred
<br>with KAZBRIG since late 2003 ) the same time that KAZBRIG
<br>became a priority focus of U.S. Security Cooperation efforts.
<br>Obstacles KAZBRIG must overcome include a variety of
<br>manning, equipping and training obstacles, but by far the
<br>most serious obstacle is the lack of professionalization.
<br>Professionalization is the only means for KAZBRIG to become a
<br>fully mission capable and deployable peace-keeping force.
<br>The Kazakhs committed to accomplishing this objective by
<br>2010, as well as obtaining NATO level-2 certification. The
<br>Kazakhs, however, have continued to slide these objectives to
<br>
<br>Astana 00000251 012 of 014
<br>
<br>
<br>the right, with the endstate and intermediate steps to
<br>reaching an endstate remaining undefined.
<br>Professionalization has simply not occurred, and with 70
<br>percent of the force still being conscripted, KAZBRIG
<br>continues to remain non-deployable and non-mission capable )
<br>by Kazakhstan law conscripts cannot deploy outside of
<br>Kazakhstan. This non-deployable non-mission capable status
<br>will continue until there is a serious commitment on behalf
<br>of the Kazakhstan MOD and Government to professionalize. The
<br>limited professionalization of KAZBRIG resembles a shotgun
<br>pattern, spread throughout the officer and NCO cadre in 1st
<br>and 2nd Battalions and KAZBRIG HQ. In light of a shifting
<br>target and the Kazakhstan MOD demand for U.S. assistance, the
<br>U.S. has remained committed and continues to train and equip
<br>KAZBRIG for a deployment that remains undefined and
<br>unobtainable in current circumstances. One battalion is
<br>currently manned, albeit at a 70 percent conscript rate, and
<br>trained for PSO, with the 2d Battalion continuing to undergo
<br>transformation, and conversion of KAZBRIG,s third combat
<br>battalion being indefinitely postponed. A result of the
<br>predominance of conscripts, with losses caused by draftees
<br>demobilizing annually at the rate of 70 percent, as well as
<br>the loss of NCOs/officers disillusioned by the lack of a
<br>meaningful deployment and substandard pay and benefits.
<br>KAZBRIG officers tend to attribute recruitment and retention
<br>problems to this lack of deployment. The NATO evaluation
<br>from the 2008 Steppe Eagle exercise, a U.S./UK/KZ exercise,
<br>indicated the one operational battalion of KAZBRIG is NATO
<br>interoperable with limitations. MOD conducted an internal
<br>evaluation of 2d Battalion during Steppe Eagle 2009, and
<br>plans to conduct another assessment of 2d Battalion and
<br>KAZBRIG staff during Steppe Eagle 2010 ) deferring further
<br>NATO interoperability and capabilities assessments of two
<br>battalions and the Brigade staff until 2011-2012.
<br>
<br>¶44. (S) Recent information indicates the UK MOD is seriously
<br>considering the termination of all security assistance with
<br>Kazakhstan due to the lack of progress with KAZBRIG. It also
<br>appears that the UK MOD will most likely provide the
<br>Kazakhstan MOD with the ultimatum of professionalizing
<br>KAZBRIG according to a strict timeline with the requirement
<br>of deploying and sustaining a platoon-size element as part of
<br>ISAF within the RC-South area to conduct base security/force
<br>protection operations. It also appears that if the Kazakhs
<br>do not commit to this request that all security cooperation
<br>will cease. Additionally, the UK would like our support for
<br>establishing strict professionalization and deployment
<br>requirements and timeline, otherwise the concern is that the
<br>Kazakhs will ignore the UK request and continue to rely on
<br>U.S. Security Cooperation to bridge the gap should the UK
<br>terminate its support.
<br>
<br>Kazbrig deployment
<br>
<br>¶45. (C) The Steppe Eagle exercise and NATO evaluation were
<br>critical to a potential deployment announcement for the
<br>KAZBRIG. A successful evaluation of the KAZBRIG is a
<br>necessary, but not sufficient condition for a deployment
<br>announcement. Given that the only deployable unit of KAZBRIG
<br>is a single battalion, then to sustain operations over the
<br>long-term the largest deployable unit is a company-size
<br>element inherent to the 3:1 deploy-reset-train force
<br>generation model. The past deployment of a platoon-size
<br>element in support of OIF did not meet the 3:1 ratio,
<br>however, future plans to deploy up to a company-size element
<br>match current capacity. Since Kazakhstani law allows only
<br>professional soldiers to participate in international
<br>operations, and since currently only KAZBRIG officer and NCO
<br>cadre are professional, MOD must also commit to full KAZBRIG
<br>professionalization to provide a deployable unit. Lack of a
<br>professionalized unit also undercuts effectiveness of
<br>combined exercises and training ) over 70 percent of KAZBRIG
<br>personnel participating in Steppe Eagle 2009 were conscripts
<br>who will be demobilized prior to Steppe Eagle 2010. Our
<br>
<br>Astana 00000251 013 of 014
<br>
<br>
<br>general belief, following a deployment announcement, is that
<br>manning problems would evaporate, training focus and
<br>assistance would increase, and KAZBRIG would be ready to
<br>conduct basic peace support operations in a low to medium
<br>threat environment under the command of a lead nation.
<br>
<br>Caspian response force development
<br>
<br>¶46. (S) The FY 2008 1206 train and equip program has focused
<br>on the development of a KAZ MOD special operations force
<br>(SOF) element to respond to threats to critical energy
<br>infrastructure and other vital sites in the Caspian region.
<br>Equipment delivered includes four 7-meter rigid-hull
<br>inflatable assault boats, and pending shipments include open-
<br>and closed-circuit SCUBA equipment, HMMWVs, and additional
<br>support items. 1206-funded contract basic SCUBA training was
<br>completed in Jul 09, and SOCCENT and the US Navy conducted
<br>Counter-NarcoTerrorism Training 2009 to assist KAZ SOF in
<br>building effective capabilities for maritime operations.
<br>While most equipment has not yet been delivered, KAZ SOF
<br>units have undergone several resubordinations and
<br>reorganizations in the interim ) our relationship with KAZ
<br>SOF is still evolving. We are maintaining planned current
<br>activities, but monitoring this relationship to ensure it
<br>remains focused in line with agreed bilateral goals.
<br>
<br>Civilian-to-military (c2m) cooperation
<br>
<br>¶47. (U) The CENTCOM C2M contact plan has also seen great
<br>growth over the past two years, primarily due to the interest
<br>of the Minister of Emergency Situations (MES), Valdimir
<br>Bozhko. Minister Bozhko has shown a personal interest in
<br>working with U.S. Agencies. The C2M programs are mainly
<br>conducted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE),
<br>Arizona National Guard (AZNG), and local Arizona emergency
<br>response agencies via the National Guard Bureau (NGB) State
<br>Partnership Program. MES interest was highlighted by a visit
<br>to Arizona and Washington, DC by the MES Minister, Vladimir
<br>Bozhko, in July 2008 to discuss the C2M program and set the
<br>stage for future C2M cooperation. Minister Bozhko was
<br>engaged and extremely pleased with his visit, and clearly
<br>outlined the areas he would like assistance from Arizona and
<br>the Corps of Engineers. The FY09 cooperation plan with MES
<br>marked a sizable expansion in the number and type of
<br>engagement activities with MES. This included exchange
<br>visits in Arizona and Kazakhstan of firefighting and 911
<br>operations. Additionally, the USACE laid the ground work for
<br>future training workshops for MES, and already held a
<br>Regional Geographical Information Systems (GIS) Workshop in
<br>Astana, Water and Levee Management Workshop in the U.S., as
<br>well as an MES visit to Washington DC to discuss future
<br>engagements in the areas of industrial safety, including oil
<br>spills, GIS and others. Our FY10 cooperation plan envisages
<br>a continuation of FY09 engagement, as well as an MES Senior
<br>Representatives visit to AZNG and USNORTHCOM. Minister
<br>Bozhko has currently expressed particular interest in the
<br>interagency and local/state/federal coordination process
<br>within the National Response Framework and the National
<br>Incident Management System. Unfortunately, the NGB State
<br>Partnership Program was only allocated $2.2M for C2M programs
<br>in FY09 to distribute amongst 48 states with programs in 63
<br>countries. Arizona received a relatively sizable $200K of
<br>available funds, but will only be able to execute 3 of the 11
<br>planned events with MES in FY10. OMC has asked the AZNG for
<br>additional NGB funding for C2M programs.
<br>
<br>Counter-narcotics (cn) programs
<br>
<br>¶48. (S) In November 2007 OMC added the new position of CN
<br>Program Coordinator. This expansion highlighted the growth
<br>of CENTCOM CN programs in Kazakhstan in cooperation with the
<br>Kazakh Border Guard Service (BGS). Since that time OMC has
<br>worked closely within the Country Team, particularly INL and
<br>EXBS, on CN and border security exchange, training, and
<br>
<br>Astana 00000251 014 of 014
<br>
<br>
<br>equipment programs aimed at helping Kazakhstan secure its
<br>borders. CENTCOM funding has delivered night-vision and
<br>avionics upgrades for three Mi-8MT helicopters ($7.9M), five
<br>Sabre 4000 hand held detectors for use at border check points
<br>($500K), and 10 UAZ 4x4 vehicles for the BGS quick response
<br>forces ($500K). OMC is currently working with the BGS on a
<br>ground-surveillance radar (GSR) program. FY09 CENTCOM
<br>funding is projected at $10M and is scheduled for upgrading
<br>one additional Mi-8MT, additional GSRs, mobile checkpoint
<br>shelters, and remote sensor systems. The CN programs also
<br>include training programs such as checkpoint inspection
<br>training. Finally, the CN exchange program has facilitated
<br>solid events such as visits to the USCG training center and
<br>the U.S.-Mexico border. These exchanges have fostered a
<br>closer relationship with the BGS and a greater interest in
<br>working with the U.S. The BGS is organized under
<br>Kazakhstan,s Intelligence Service, the Committee for State
<br>Security (KNB), an unreformed former Soviet intelligence
<br>service with close ties to the FSB and suspicious of U.S.
<br>interaction. The KNB has recently asserted itself as
<br>oversight for our cooperation with the BGS and begun to
<br>severely limit the scope and participation in engagement
<br>activities. In coordination with INL, OMC is starting to
<br>develop cooperative training, equipment and construction
<br>programs with the interagency Counternarcotics Committee,
<br>under the Ministry for Internal Affairs, and the Customs
<br>Committee, under the Finance Ministry.
<br>
<br>Final words
<br>
<br>¶49. (SBU) In conclusion, we are very much looking forward to
<br>your upcoming visit. The entire Embassy team looks forward
<br>to providing you with a rewarding and productive visit with a
<br>valuable strategic partner who is vital to our national
<br>strategic interests. We remain ready to answer any of your
<br>questions.
