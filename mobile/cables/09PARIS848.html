<br>LEADING TO ELECTIONS 
<br>
<br>REF: A. EMBASSY ANTANANARIVO-KANEDA E-MAIL (JUNE 23) 
<br>¶B. PARIS 815 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Acting Minister Counselor for Political Affairs Andrew Y 
<br>oung, 1.4 (b/d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C/NF) SUMMARY: France continues to favor a political 
<br>consensus among contending parties that would lead to 
<br>credible elections, Presidential AF-advisor Remi Marechaux 
<br>said on June 23. However, neither Rajoelina, Ravalomanana 
<br>(who is recruiting mercenaries in France), nor Ratsiraka are 
<br>making any conciliatory gestures. The international 
<br>community needs to continue pressuring them. SADC's recent 
<br>policy shift is helpful, as is its naming of Joaquim Chissano 
<br>as SADC mediator for Madagascar; the next International 
<br>Contact Meeting should take place in Antananarivo. Marechaux 
<br>denied rumors indicating that France was providing a military 
<br>plane to the HAT; he said that bilateral relations were in a 
<br>"gray zone," with the new French Ambassador not yet having 
<br>presented his credentials. Marechaux said that France was 
<br>abiding by the EU's strictures against "no new 
<br>non-humanitarian assistance," which the EU was enforcing 
<br>strictly. The GOF is trying its best not to embroil itself 
<br>in the dispute over control over Madagascar's embassy in 
<br>Paris. Marechaux labeled French businessman and 
<br>behind-the-scenes fixer Robert Bourgi as an opportunist with 
<br>little experience in Madagascar, who was asked to involve 
<br>himself by Franco-Malgache insider Patrick Lelu (phonetic). 
<br>END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>CONSENSUS LEADING TO ELECTIONS IS NECESSARY 
<br>
<br>¶2. XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>
<br>¶11. (C/NF) As had his colleague Romain Serman (ref B, paras 
<br>7-11), Marechaux expressed discomfort with private 
<br>businessman and behind-the-scenes fixer Robert Bourgi's 
<br>apparent involvement in Madagascar. He said that Bourgi had 
<br>no prior experience with Madagascar but had been asked to get 
<br>involved by Patrick Lelu (phonetic), a Franco-Malgache 
<br>businessman and advisor to several leading Malgache figures. 
<br>Marechaux said that Bourgi, looking for new business after 
<br>the death of Gabon's President Bongo, was eager to seek new 
<br>opportunities in Madagascar. Marechaux repeated that Bourgi 
<br>was not in any way associated with the GOF and was interested 
<br>only in exploiting his own opportunities.
