<br>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR CODEL BERMAN'S VISIT TO KOREA
<br>
<br>Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Mark A. Tokola.
<br>Reasons 1.4 (b),
<br>(d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY:  CODEL Berman, welcome to Korea.  The
<br>alliance between the U.S. and the Republic of Korea (ROK) is
<br>strong, enduring, and strategically important.  Your visit
<br>follows the successful June 16 U.S.-ROK Presidential Summit
<br>and adoption of the Joint Vision Statement.  The Joint Vision
<br>Statement was well-received here, both for its recommitment
<br>to a continued strengthening of our security relationship
<br>(including its affirmation of the U.S. nuclear umbrella and
<br>extended deterrence to the ROK), and for outlining what a
<br>21st century U.S.-ROK relationship entails.  To realize this
<br>vision, we will need to continue to expand our cooperation,
<br>both regionally and globally.  Security in the region,
<br>particularly in view of North Korea,s continued belligerent
<br>posture and Kim Jong-Il,s declining health, is important to
<br>Korean officials.  Like us, the ROK supports the Six Party
<br>Talks and remains adamant that we should not recognize North
<br>Korea as a nuclear state.  Your South Korean interlocutors
<br>are very interested in how you view the proposed North Korean
<br>contingency plan, and prospects for denuclearizing North
<br>Korea.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) President Lee has faced criticism from his opponents
<br>for his inability to generate momentum for the Korea-U.S.
<br>(KORUS) FTA in Washington.  Ratification of the FTA is seen
<br>as a sign of America's strategic commitment in northeast
<br>Asia.  President Obama's statement at the April G20 meeting
<br>with Lee, that the U.S. wanted to find a way forward on the
<br>KORUS FTA, allayed some of the anxiety in Seoul, and enabled
<br>Lee to push the FTA through the committee of jurisdiction in
<br>Korea,s National Assembly in late April.  A full plenary
<br>vote in the National Assembly has not been scheduled; while
<br>opponents are vocal, the KORUS FTA continues to receive about
<br>a 60 percent approval Korean public opinion polls, is
<br>strongly supported by the majority GNP party, and is expected
<br>to pass once there is some sign of movement in Washington.
<br>The Obama Administration is conducting a thorough review of
<br>the KORUS FTA and consulting closely with all stakeholders to
<br>understand the exact nature of their concerns, and to develop
<br>recommendations for addressing them.  To assist with this
<br>review, and to ensure that all who may have an interest in
<br>this free trade agreement are able to fully express their
<br>views, we issued a Federal Register Notice on July 27, 2009,
<br>requesting comments on the KORUS FTA.  End Summary.
<br>
<br>----------
<br>BACKGROUND
<br>----------
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) The ROK, with its vibrant democracy, free market,
<br>high-tech economy, highly educated population, free press,
<br>and ever-deepening people-to-people ties with the United
<br>States, is a striking success story, including for U.S.
<br>foreign policy.  Our intensive engagement with the ROK since
<br>its founding in 1948 exemplifies the importance of all three
<br>pillars Secretary Clinton has outlined describing U.S.
<br>foreign policy:  defense, diplomacy, and development.  South
<br>Korea's success is based on a shared commitment to defense,
<br>as shown by the 28,500 U.S. troops still on the Peninsula,
<br>the substantial development assistance the U.S. provided
<br>after the Korean War, and our close diplomatic cooperation to
<br>achieve a denuclearized North Korea and a more secure and
<br>prosperous future for the region.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Now a developed country with a tested democratic
<br>system, South Korea increasingly has the capability as well
<br>as the political will to assume larger regional and global
<br>roles.  Your visit will encourage your interlocutors to
<br>become even more active partners with us on issues ranging
<br>from human rights promotion to climate change to sea piracy
<br>to counter-terrorism.  We share values and strategic goals
<br>with this highly capable ally; we need to give substance to
<br>our shared aspiration to upgrade our bilateral relationship,
<br>making it a global partnership.
<br>
<br>----------------------
<br>The Domestic Situation
<br>----------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) President Lee, of the center-right Grand National
<br>Party (GNP), began his single five-year term in February
<br>2008, ending ten years of center-left control of the
<br>Presidency.  In April 2008 the GNP won a solid majority over
<br>the main opposition Democratic Party (DP) in the unicameral
<br>National Assembly.  The GNP's success at the polls, however,
<br>belied the lack of consensus among the South Korean public on
<br>domestic political issues like media law reform, labor relations,
<br>tax policy, and education.  President Lee has
<br>struggled with low approval ratings -- about 30 percent --
<br>since taking office, especially following his decision to
<br>re-open the Korean market to U.S. beef last year.  In the
<br>National Assembly, the GNP and DP have even lower approval
<br>ratings than President Lee, resulting in a virtually
<br>deadlocked domestic agenda.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) President Lee has remained publicly disengaged from
<br>the squabbling in the National Assembly and is focusing
<br>instead on foreign policy, resource diplomacy, and
<br>international cooperative efforts on green growth, climate
<br>change, and overcoming the economic crisis.  He campaigned on
<br>a pledge to strengthen the U.S.-ROK alliance, and is widely
<br>seen as having been successful.  With China and Russia, he
<br>has substantially expanded the ROK's economic and political
<br>ties.  He has attempted to overcome historical animosities
<br>with Japan to advance Korea-Japan ties based on Korea's
<br>pragmatic interests, but sensitivities to Japan's
<br>colonization of Korea run deep.  Looking wider, President Lee
<br>is actively cultivating new ties with Southeast Asia, Central
<br>Asia, and Europe.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Former President Kim Dae-jung's health has been
<br>failing and he is currently hospitalized in Seoul in
<br>intensive care.  The prognosis for President Kim, who was in
<br>office 1998-2003 and who is 84, is not good.
<br>
<br>------------
<br>The Alliance
<br>------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) For over half a century the U.S.-ROK alliance has
<br>provided the foundation for peace and prosperity in Northeast
<br>Asia.  The ROK has benefitted greatly; neither the economic
<br>"Miracle on the Han" nor Korea,s democratic flowering would
<br>have been possible absent a U.S. defense shield and economic
<br>assistance and support.  The U.S. too has benefited.  USFK
<br>(U.S. Forces in Korea) is our only troop presence in mainland
<br>East Asia, and South Korea contributes billions of dollars to
<br>USFK operating expenses.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) The Summit Joint Vision Statement offers a compelling
<br>vision of expanding the role of the U.S.-ROK alliance
<br>regionally and globally.  On the Korean Peninsula, we are
<br>also working to strengthen, further broaden, and
<br>appropriately evolve the security relationship by
<br>implementing three key bilateral transformation agreements
<br>known as YRP, LPP and STP.
<br>
<br>-- YRP:  The Yongsan Relocation Plan will relocate the
<br>headquarters of U.S. Forces (USFK) from the middle of Seoul
<br>to a new, purpose-built war-fighting headquarters south of
<br>the city, thereby giving back to the Koreans a large tract of
<br>land historically associated with Japanese occupation which
<br>they plan to turn into a central park.  Progress on the
<br>implementation of YRP continues but construction to prepare
<br>U.S. Army Garrison ) Humphreys, the hub for the relocation,
<br>continues on schedule but faces obstacles that require
<br>President Lee,s and his administration,s support if we are
<br>to meet the agreed 2014 completion date.
<br>
<br>-- LPP:  The Land Partnership Plan will consolidate over 100
<br>U.S. military bases spread all across Korea into two key
<br>strategic hubs south of the Han River, replacing an outdated
<br>military footprint from the end of the Korean War with a
<br>modern and better-positioned force posture.  The ROK Ministry
<br>of National Defense (MND) seeks to complete the LPP by the
<br>end of 2015.
<br>
<br>-- STP: The Strategic Transition Plan is the process under
<br>which we are transferring wartime operational control (OPCON)
<br>of South Korean forces from the U.S. military to the ROK
<br>military by April 17, 2012.  President Lee has emphasized the
<br>need to keep the spotlight off of wartime OPCON transition
<br>due to increased scrutiny by ROK domestic opposition groups
<br>regarding the April 17, 2012 transition date (in the wake of
<br>North Korea,s recent claimed nuclear test).  We are
<br>continuing to emphasize the process for close cooperation in
<br>reviewing OPCON transition progress through the SCM and
<br>management of messaging and public perceptions to highlight
<br>the value of the restructuring.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) We must continue to emphasize the importance of
<br>completing the two relocation elements of USFK
<br>transformation, YRP and LPP.  Those agreements, signed in
<br>2004, did not come with appropriated funds.  The Master Plan,
<br>finished in 2007, lays out the cost and timeline but the ROKG
<br>has yet to request funding from the National Assembly.  Other
<br>U.S. and ROK private sector initiatives are failing to fill
<br>the funding gap.  As a result, alliance transformation, which
<br>was originally scheduled for completion in 2008, is facing a
<br>delay of many more years.  To avoid further delays, the ROKG
<br>must make implementation of these moves a priority.  For our
<br>part, we must be clear and consistent in identifying our own
<br>top priorities .
<br>
<br>¶11. (C).  The time is right to expand the areas in which the
<br>U.S. and the ROK cooperate on global security issues.  You
<br>may want to raise the following areas where the ROK may be
<br>ready to increase its global security role:
<br>
<br>-- Afghanistan:  The ROKG is planning to provide more
<br>assistance and training in Afghanistan, including building a
<br>new hospital and a training center in Bagram, and
<br>contributing ambulances, motorcycles, and police trainers.
<br>However, we need a lot more from the ROK, especially
<br>financial support for the Afghan Army, for which we have
<br>requested USD 100 million a year for five years, which is the
<br>USG primary request of the ROK.  The ROKG also is considering
<br>sending a Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) to
<br>Afghanistan, which we would welcome, but we also have
<br>insisted that any such PRT include a military unit to provide
<br>for its own security.  Such a deployment (the PRT as well as
<br>any other military assets, such as an ISR unit )
<br>intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) will need
<br>National Assembly approval, which will pose difficult, but
<br>not insurmountable, political problems for President Lee.
<br>
<br>-- UN Peacekeeping Operations:  The National Assembly is
<br>deliberating on a bill that will allow the ROK military to be
<br>deployed for peacekeeping missions without prior legislative
<br>approval.  In the meantime, the National Assembly in July
<br>approved extending the ROK,s PKO deployment in Lebanon until
<br>the end of December 2010.  The ROK has contributed 367
<br>soldiers for peacekeeping in Lebanon since 2007 and is
<br>participating in eight other PKO operations around the world.
<br>As of January 1, 2008 the ROK was the 10th largest provider
<br>of assessed contributions to the UN PKO budget.
<br>
<br>-- Combating Piracy off Somalia:  The ROK is a member of the
<br>Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia.
<br>Additionally, the ROKG deployed a 4,500 ton class destroyer
<br>equipped with a Lynx helicopter and rigid inflatable craft to
<br>the Gulf of Aden to be part of the maritime security
<br>operations of the combined maritime forces.  The destroyer
<br>carries up to 310 personnel.
<br>
<br>-- Proliferation Security Initiative:  In response to the
<br>DPRK,s May rocket launch and nuclear test, the ROK on May 26
<br>joined the U.S.-initiated Proliferation Security Initiative
<br>(PSI).   In June the ROK participated in a PSI meeting in
<br>Poland, and held a workshop in Seoul in July.  The ROKG plans
<br>to attend the next workshop in Sydney in September, and has
<br>expressed interest in attending the interdiction exercises in
<br>Singapore in October.  PSI is an international, interagency
<br>effort aimed at preventing or interdicting the proliferation
<br>of weapons of mass destruction using existing domestic laws
<br>and established international agreements.  The ROKG currently
<br>is formulating an interagency strategy for its effective PSI
<br>participation.
<br>
<br>---------------------------
<br>U.S.-ROK Global Partnership
<br>---------------------------
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) The ROK also wants to play a bigger role on other
<br>global issues and the following are good areas for increased
<br>cooperation:
<br>
<br>-- Democracy and Human Rights: The ROK has demonstrated a new
<br>readiness to address human rights concerns in the DPRK,
<br>co-sponsoring the annual UNGA North Korea human rights
<br>resolution in 2008 for the first time.  In October 2008 the
<br>ROK agreed to chair the first Senior Officials' Meeting of
<br>the Asia-Pacific Democracy Partnership, a U.S.-supported
<br>regional subset of the Community of Democracies.
<br>
<br>-- Climate Change:  Korea, the 13th largest per capita
<br>emitter of greenhouse gases and the world,s 15th largest
<br>economy in terms of GDP, is playing a constructive role in
<br>discussions on global climate change.  The ROKG shares the
<br>U.S. view that that investment in new and renewable energy
<br>sources not only can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but
<br>also can create jobs, spur economic growth, and enhance
<br>energy security. The U.S. Department of Energy is engaged in
<br>a variety of collaborative R&D activities with Korea,
<br>including in nuclear energy, fusion, gas hydrates,
<br>"smart grids," and other new and renewable energy technologies, but
<br>there is room to expand and strengthen our cooperation.
<br>
<br>-- Development Assistance:  Korea's overseas development
<br>assistance program currently includes nearly USD 500 million
<br>in Official Development Assistance (ODA), as well as a
<br>roughly similar figure for North Korea (suspended).  The ROKG
<br>target is to triple ODA (as a percentage of GDP) by 2015.
<br>With limited functional and regional capacity, Korea should
<br>be receptive to policy discussions on ODA coordination.
<br>
<br>-- Counter-Proliferation:  The ROKG has told Iranian
<br>counterparts at every opportunity that Tehran's uranium
<br>enrichment activities are unacceptable and has supported the
<br>P5-plus-1 incentives package.
<br>
<br>-----------------------
<br>FTA and Economic Issues
<br>-----------------------
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) President Lee has faced criticism from his opponents
<br>for his inability to generate momentum for the Korea-U.S.
<br>(KORUS) FTA in Washington.  President Obama's statement at
<br>the April G20 meeting with Lee, that the U.S. wanted to find
<br>a way forward on the KORUS FTA, allayed some of the anxiety
<br>in Seoul, and enabled Lee to push the FTA through the
<br>committee of jurisdiction in Korea,s National Assembly in
<br>late April.  A full plenary vote in the National Assembly has
<br>not been scheduled; while opponents are vocal, the KORUS FTA
<br>continues to receive about a 60 percent approval Korean
<br>public opinion polls, is strongly supported by the majority
<br>GNP party, and is expected to pass once there is some sign of
<br>movement in Washington.  The Obama Administration is
<br>conducting a thorough review of the KORUS FTA and consulting
<br>closely with all stakeholders to understand the exact nature
<br>of their concerns, to develop recommendations for addressing
<br>them.  To assist with this review, and to ensure that all who
<br>may have an interest in this free trade agreement are able to
<br>fully express their views, we issued a Federal Register
<br>Notice on July 27, 2009, requesting comments on the KORUS FTA.
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) Korea is our seventh largest trading partner, with
<br>total merchandise trade in 2008 of over USD 82 billion (and
<br>more than USD 100 billion if services are included).  The
<br>U.S. International Trade Commission estimated in September
<br>2007 that U.S. merchandise exports to Korea would expand by
<br>USD 10-12 billion on an annual basis as a result of the FTA
<br>and that services exports would also expand.  The United
<br>States has traditionally been the ROK's biggest trading
<br>partner in the post-WWII era.  One tangible sign of China's
<br>growing importance in Asia and in Korea, however, is that
<br>China displaced the United States as Korea's top trading
<br>partner in 2004.  By 2008, China-ROK merchandise trade
<br>reached USD 168 billion, doubling the U.S.-ROK total.  With
<br>respect to North Korea, China accounts for nearly 50 percent
<br>of that country's total trade.  The growing economic and
<br>political role of China on the Korean peninsula is one of the
<br>most important motivations for Korea to enter into FTA
<br>negotiations with the United States.  Successive ROK
<br>Governments have seen the ratification and implementation of
<br>the KORUS FTA as symbolic of the U.S. will to remain fully
<br>engaged in Northeast Asia in the face of increasing Chinese
<br>influence.
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) Korea also wants to conclude an FTA with the United
<br>States because Korean economic reformers recognize that the
<br>Korean economy needs to liberalize and open in order to
<br>promote greater competitiveness vis--vis China and Japan.
<br>South Korea has concluded a number of FTAs and launched
<br>negotiations on others since the signing of the KORUS FTA
<br>negotiations on June 30, 2007.  The ROK has implemented FTAs
<br>with Chile, Singapore, EFTA, and ASEAN (except investment).
<br>The ROK has concluded negotiations with India and signing is
<br>reportedly imminent.  Negotiations are underway with Canada,
<br>Mexico, the Gulf Cooperation Council, Australia, New Zealand,
<br>and Peru.  In July, the ROKG announced that negotiations on
<br>the EU-Korea FTA were concluded (but the agreement is not yet
<br>signed).  ROK media have been filled with stories of the
<br>increasing economic weight of Europe in Korea as a result of
<br>the FTA.  The Board of Governors of the American Chamber of
<br>Commerce has expressed concern that the EU-Korea FTA will
<br>disadvantage the competitiveness of U.S. firms vis--vis
<br>their European competitors in Korea.
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) The reopening of the beef market was accomplished in
<br>an April 2008 agreement separate from the FTA.  Under this
<br>agreement, the United States and Korea agreed to reopen
<br>Korea,s market to U.S. beef and beef products in a manner
<br>fully consistent with international standards and science.
<br>In June 2008, following massive street protests in Seoul,
<br>U.S. beef exporters and Korean beef importers reached a
<br>temporary commercial agreement to only export beef and beef
<br>products from cattle under 30 months of age, as a
<br>transitional measure, until Korean consumer confidence
<br>improves.  While beef sales have not yet returned to past
<br>levels due to Korea,s currency exchange fluctuations,
<br>increased competition from Australian beef, and lingering
<br>public concerns about the safety of U.S. beef, the market is
<br>open and we expect increased sales over the medium term.
<br>Korea is also watching closely our ongoing negotiations with
<br>other countries that have stricter restrictions on U.S. beef.
<br>
<br>¶17. (C) On the global financial reform discussions, Korea is
<br>a strong ally in the G-20 process (which it will chair in
<br>2010).  Korea is enthusiastic about the G20 as the global
<br>forum for action on the global financial system.  The ROKG is
<br>concerned that European countries are advocating other
<br>formulas for such discussions that would exclude Korea.
<br>Within the G20, President Lee has called for a strong fiscal
<br>response and refraining from protectionism as well as
<br>necessary regulatory improvements.  President Lee Myung-bak
<br>has strongly argued that it would be premature to withdraw
<br>the national fiscal stimulus packages at this juncture.
<br>Korea sees itself as lining up on the U.S. side on almost all
<br>G20 debates.
<br>
<br>¶18. (C) The Korean economy is looking better and is
<br>increasingly forecast to be one of the first major economies
<br>to emerge from recession.  The benchmark KOSPI stock index in
<br>early August reached the highest level since mid-August 2008
<br>and the won, the Korean currency, closed at 1218 per dollar
<br>on August 4, the strongest level since October 14, 2008.
<br>Most analysts foresee further strengthening of the won in the
<br>months ahead.  The picture looked far different last fall,
<br>when the financial crisis hit Korea hard.  A USD 30 billion
<br>swap line extended by the U.S. Federal Reserve in October, as
<br>the Korean won was plummeting and Korea looked to be on the
<br>brink of a financial panic, helped Korea weather the worst of
<br>the storm, and gained tremendous gratitude.  The later
<br>Japanese and Chinese swap mechanisms did not have the same
<br>impact.  In the closing months of 2008 Korea experienced
<br>dramatic contraction of demand for its exports.  The ROKG's
<br>stabilization and stimulus packages mitigated the impact and
<br>the weakened currency has generated a significant current
<br>account surplus in recent months.  Sectors of the Korean
<br>economy facing restructuring challenges include construction,
<br>shipbuilding, shipping and automotive.  GM Daewoo, GM,s
<br>Korean subsidiary, is negotiating with the Korea Development
<br>Bank for a sizeable loanto restructure its operations.
<br>
<br>-----------
<br>North Korea
<br>-----------
<br>
<br>¶19. (C) Presidents Obama and Lee agreed to send a clear
<br>message to North Korea that its provocations come at a price.
<br>They also agreed on principles to deal with North Korea's
<br>nuclear and missile threats, including commitments to
<br>achieving the "complete and verifiable elimination" of North
<br>Korea's nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs as well
<br>as the ballistic missile program.  Korean officials continue
<br>to seek assurances that the United States will consult
<br>closely with the ROK on its North Korea policy and that the
<br>United States will not recognize North Korea as a nuclear
<br>state.
<br>
<br>¶20. (C) North Korea policy is almost always the most
<br>sensitive issue on the South Korean agenda.  Fifty-five years
<br>of alliance notwithstanding, the ROKG still fears being left
<br>out or surprised by Washington's initiatives or policy
<br>changes on North Korea.  Simply put, the ROKG must be seen by
<br>South Koreans as being informed and consulted on all USG
<br>moves on North Korea.  Korean officials see Washington and
<br>Seoul as partners in forming and implementing policies toward
<br>the North and consistently seek affirmation that Washington
<br>will not allow Pyongyang to drive a wedge between us.
<br>
<br>¶21. (C) There is virtually no chance of early improvement in
<br>South-North relations; President Lee is determined to stick
<br>to principle and to insist on a more reciprocal relationship
<br>with the North, and Kim Jong-il will not give in for his own
<br>domestic reasons.  Importantly, South Koreans appear tired
<br>of, but not particularly bothered by, the continuing
<br>threatening rhetoric from the North, and therefore seem
<br>largely comfortable with their government's stance.
<br>Heightening tensions in the West Sea and missile launches
<br>have created less public anxiety than might be expected.  The
<br>ROKG will welcome the opportunity to present with you a
<br>united front of calm and determination toward the North,
<br>combined with a call to return to the Six- Party Talks.
<br>
<br>¶22. (SBU) The Kaesong Industrial Complex (KIC) is the only
<br>remaining joint economic project between North and South
<br>Korea.   (The other joint venture, Mt. Kumkang tours, was
<br>closed on July 11, 2008, after North Korean security forces
<br>shot a South Korean tourist to death.)  Located in North
<br>Korea, six miles north of the DMZ, the KIC opened in December
<br>2004 and is home to 106 ROK-owned factories employing
<br>approximately 40,000 North Korean workers (84 percent are
<br>women age 20-39).  Since late 2008, North-South tensions
<br>regarding the KIC have increased.  The DPRK closed the border
<br>temporarily on multiple occasions, and has placed limits on
<br>the number of South Korean employees allowed in the KIC.  The
<br>DPRK is demanding drastically higher wages for employees (up
<br>from USD 55 to USD 300 per month), construction of additional
<br>dormitories and an additional fee of USD 500 million for land
<br>usage.
<br>
<br>¶23. (SBU) North Koreans detained a South Korean Hyundai Asan
<br>employee working at KIC on March 30, accusing him of defaming
<br>North Korea and attempting to suborn a North Korean female
<br>worker.  In addition to securing the release of the ROK
<br>citizen, South Korea's priorities at the KIC include
<br>guaranteeing employee safety, freedom of access and
<br>border-crossing, and increasing the number of North Korean
<br>workers brought in from outside the Kaesong area.  Although
<br>the South Korean firms at KIC are concerned about the current
<br>tension and complain of financial losses, only one company
<br>has withdrawn from KIC to date.
<br>
<br>¶24. (SBU) The DPRK and the ROK have held four rounds of
<br>negotiations between April and July 2009 without any
<br>breakthrough, with the most recent session taking place on
<br>July 2.  Both sides appear to be committed to continuing KIC
<br>operations.  The United States has consistently supported
<br>North-South dialogue and expressed hope that the two sides
<br>will resolve their disputes over the KIC.
<br>

<br>VWP/WEST
<br>--------
<br>
<br>¶25. (U)  The ROK was included in the the Visa Waiver Program
<br>(VWP) in October 2008. This step has been a success in
<br>facilitating travel and improving people-to-people ties
<br>between nations.  As of the beginning of July, approximately
<br>200,000 Koreans had applied for VWP approval using the ESTA
<br>(Electronic Approval for Travel Authorization).  More than 99
<br>percent of the ESTA applications have been approved and we
<br>continue to see an upward trend in ESTA usage.
<br>
<br>¶26. (U)  The WEST (Work, English Study, and Travel) program,
<br>inaugurated in March 2009, allows qualifying college students
<br>and recent graduates to enter the U.S. for up to 18 months on
<br>J-1 exchange visitor visas that allow them to study English,
<br>participate in professional-level internships and travel
<br>independently.  A group of 185 Korean students have already
<br>travelled to the U.S. on the WEST program and a second wave
<br>of 159 is preparing to depart.  As of December 2008, there
<br>were 110,000 South Koreans studying in the U.S. at all
<br>levels, from elementary to graduate school.  According to
<br>Korean Ministry of Education data for 2007, 27% of all
<br>post-graduate students choosing to study abroad chose to
<br>study in the U.S.
<br>
<br>---------------
<br>The Bottom Line
<br>---------------
<br>
<br>¶27. (C) South Korea is a like-minded, energetic partner that
<br>is ready, prepared, and wants to have a broader and deeper
<br>alliance with the United States.  Koreans would like the
<br>alliance to be a lot more than a security arrangement.  Yes,
<br>they want more say, even a more equal relationship, but this
<br>is only part of their motivation.  Rather, they see that
<br>their ties with the U.S. are deeper now than ever; witness,
<br>for example, the two million-strong Korean American
<br>community, and the enormous numbers of Koreans studying in
<br>the United States.  Above all, however, a very large majority
<br>of South Koreans are convinced that the ROK and the United
<br>States have shared values and shared strategic interests.
<br>It's time to take the relationship to a new level of global
<br>partnership, even as we deepen our cooperation on the Korean
<br>peninsula.

<br>Your Meetings
<br>-------------
<br>
<br>¶28. (C) You are scheduled to meet with President Lee
<br>Myung-bak, National security Advisor Kim Sung-hwan, Foreign
<br>Minister Yu Myung-hwan, Trade Minister Kim Jong-hoon, Speaker
<br>of the National Assembly Kim Hyong-o, and Chairman of the
<br>National Assembly Foreign Affairs, Trade and Unification
<br>Committee Park Jin.  Likely topics of discussion include:
<br>
<br>-- North Korea: Your interlocutors may seek assurances that
<br>the U.S. will consult closely with the ROK on its North Korea
<br>policy and that the U.S. will not recognize North Korea as a
<br>nuclear state.
<br>
<br>-- U.S.-ROK Alliance: Your interlocutors may stress the
<br>importance of the U.S. commitment to the defense of the
<br>Korean peninsula.
<br>
<br>-- Global Partnership: Your interlocutors may gauge your
<br>level of interest in ROK contributions to reconstruction and
<br>stabilization of vital countries such as Afghanistan and
<br>Pakistan; ROK peacekeeping in Lebanon; and anti-piracy
<br>efforts off the coast of Somalia.
<br>
<br>-- FTA: Your interlocutors will seek your views on the
<br>prospects for Congressional approval of the agreement.  The
<br>Trade Minister will stress that the FTA represents a balance
<br>of American and Korean interests and that the ROKG cannot
<br>re-negotiate the text of the FTA.
