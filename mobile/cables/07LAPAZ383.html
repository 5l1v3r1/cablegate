<br>SUMMARY 
<br>----------- 
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) Embassy La Paz warmly welcomes CODEL Nelson to Bolivia 
<br>February 21. Shortly after indigenous coca leader Evo Morales' 
<br>one-year anniversary as president, Bolivians find themselves again 
<br>facing the social unrest that has plagued their country since 2003, 
<br>but which had subsided after Morales took office. The fourth 
<br>president in as many years, Morales rose to power promising a 
<br>"revolution" that would deliver a more inclusive society, a new 
<br>constitution, nationalization of natural resources, and land reform. 
<br>Morales has delivered on some of his promises, but is facing 
<br>increasing difficulties governing Bolivia, which he himself has 
<br>exacerbated this year by condoning and even encouraging street 
<br>protests against those who oppose him. While we support Morales' 
<br>stated goal of social inclusion, serious questions exist about his 
<br>commitment to democracy and to the rule of law--our top priorities 
<br>here-- particularly given his demonstrated impatience with 
<br>compromise. Cuban and Venezuelan advice, interference, and 
<br>assistance are an additional area of concern. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) Summary continued: Although Bolivia's macro-economic 
<br>outlook remains strong in the short term, Morales' nationalization 
<br>of hydrocarbons and the February 9 move against non-U.S. interests 
<br>in the mining sector will threaten new investment. Trade should be 
<br>key to Bolivia's future, and Congress' extension of ATPDEA benefits 
<br>was well-received here. The GOB has shown little real interest in a 
<br>long-term trade agreement. On counter-narcotics, the Morales 
<br>government's mixed results on counter-narcotics reflect its confused 
<br>strategy -- encouragement of coca cultivation (and thus, more 
<br>cocaine) coupled with increased interdiction efforts. Your visit 
<br>provides an opportunity to encourage Morales to follow a democratic 
<br>path and to respect U.S. mining interests; to take counter-narcotics 
<br>issues more seriously and to become a true partner in fighting the 
<br>flow of illegal drugs; and to take advantage of free trade and other 
<br>opportunities, including the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA). 
<br>End summary. 
<br>
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>BOLIVIA: BACKGROUND NOTES 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) Landlocked Bolivia is the highest and most isolated of the 
<br>Latin American republics. Once over 780,000 square miles, Bolivia 
<br>lost large chunks of its land to Chile and Paraguay, leaving it with 
<br>some 424,000 square miles, roughly three times the size of Nevada. 
<br>Aymara indigenous groups dominate La Paz and the highlands; the 
<br>Quechuas populate the cities of Sucre and Cochabamba and surrounding 
<br>areas. The rich lowlands, known as the "half-moon" states, tend to 
<br>be less influenced by indigenous cultures. The government 
<br>recognizes 38 different indigenous groups and over 60 percent of 
<br>Bolivians identify themselves as indigenous, making Bolivia the most 
<br>indigenous country in Latin America. Bolivia is a country of 
<br>contrast, with a small prosperous minority of its population 
<br>immersed in modern business and technology and the overwhelming poor 
<br>majority still mired in poverty and living relatively unchanged by 
<br>progress. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) Rapidly urbanizing Bolivia is the second poorest country in 
<br>Latin America, with poverty afflicting two-thirds of its population. 
<br>In 2005, its GDP was approximately USD 8.5 billion. Agriculture 
<br>accounts for roughly 14.5 percent of Bolivia's GDP, and soybeans 
<br>grown in eastern Bolivia are the major cash crop. Extraction of 
<br>minerals and hydrocarbons make up an estimated 10 percent of GDP, 
<br>with manufacturing accounting for another 12 percent. Lack of 
<br>economic opportunities has fueled mass migration to Argentina, 
<br>Brazil, Spain, and the United States, as well as rural-to-urban and 
<br>western-to-eastern migration within the country. 
<br>
<br>-------------- 
<br>SOCIAL UNREST 
<br>-------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) Shortly after indigenous coca leader Evo Morales' one-year 
<br>anniversary as president, Bolivians find themselves again facing the 
<br>social unrest that has plagued their country since 2003, but which 
<br>had subsided after Morales took office. The fourth president in as 
<br>many years, Morales rose to power promising a "revolution" that 
<br>would deliver a more inclusive society, a new constitution, 
<br>nationalization of natural resources, and land reform. A sharp 
<br>political strategist, Morales has delivered on some of his promises, 
<br>and has maintained high popularity rates. However, his first year 
<br>in office has brought Morales to terms with the difficulties of 
<br>governing Bolivia. He has exacerbated the challenge by condoning 
<br>street protests against those who opposed him. A cocalero ambush of 
<br>Bolivian anti-drug forces in the Chapare, a mining clash in Huanuni, 
<br>a 500,000-person strong demonstration in favor of regional autonomy 
<br>in eastern Bolivia, January riots in Cochabamba, and a February 7 
<br>protest by miners in La Paz have presented Morales with serious 
<br>challenges. 
<br>
<br>----------------------- 
<br>DEFENDING DEMOCRACY 
<br>----------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) While we support Morales' stated goal of social inclusion, 
<br>serious questions exist about his commitment to 
<br>democracy and to the rule of law--our top priorities here-- 
<br>particularly given his demonstrated impatience with democratic rules 
<br>and compromise. Bolivia convened a constitutional convention in 
<br>August 2006, which to date has failed to make any progress, largely 
<br>due to executive branch interference and Morales' opposition to 
<br>Bolivian constitutional norms and traditions. Before the convention 
<br>may begin its work, it must decide what vote will be required to 
<br>approve constitutional changes. The GOB has taken a hard-line 
<br>approach, repeatedly refusing to compromise with the opposition. 
<br>Morales has packed the Supreme Court using recess appointments, 
<br>instructed his party to pass a questionable land reform law and a 
<br>military treaty with Venezuela in a late-night senate session 
<br>November 28, and permitted violence against opposition hunger 
<br>strikers, as well as the kidnapping of an opposition prefect. Most 
<br>recently, the GOB is widely thought to have instigated the January 
<br>protests in Cochabamba aimed at sacking an opposition prefect. 
<br>(Despite GOB denials, evidence exists that the administration paid, 
<br>transported and fed armed cocaleros who were bussed to Cochabamba to 
<br>riot against an opposition-led local government). In addition to 
<br>frequent public attacks on the opposition, Morales also has targeted 
<br>Bolivia's prefects (governors), eastern Bolivia (because it seeks 
<br>regional autonomy), the judiciary, and the press. 
<br>
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br>ONE PLACE WHERE WE'RE NOT BIG BROTHER 
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) In addition to internal pressures, Cuban and Venezuelan 
<br>advice, interference, and assistance continue to be a serious 
<br>concern. Cuban doctors and newly-inaugurated hospitals bring 
<br>medical care to isolated communities. Venezuela has agreed to 
<br>purchase Bolivian soy, has provided micro credit financing to small 
<br>businesses, has donated tractors to Bolivian farmers, and has funded 
<br>community radio stations to broadcast the GOB's messages. Most 
<br>recently, the Venezuelan government has agreed to buy essentially 
<br>all of Bolivia's tainted beef, otherwise quarantined by an outbreak 
<br>of hoof-and-mouth disease, as well as its industrialized coca. 
<br>These Venezuelan programs receive frequent public acclaim from 
<br>Bolivia's poor. On the other hand, middle class Bolivians resent 
<br>Venezuela's growing presence and influence, and have balked at the 
<br>Bolivian military singing the Venezuelan national anthem and 
<br>depending on Venezuelan-donated helicopters to transport their 
<br>president. Regionally, Bolivia has strengthened ties with Chile, but 
<br>has alienated Brazil and Argentina at various points over the past 
<br>year, largely because of its nationalistic but incoherent 
<br>hydrocarbons policy. 
<br>
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br>NATIONALIZATION OF RESOURCES AND TRADE 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU) Although Bolivia's macro-economic outlook remains strong in 
<br>the short term, Morales' nationalization of hydrocarbons and moves 
<br>against non-U.S. interests in the mining sector (where the bulk of 
<br>U.S. investments lie) threaten new investment. On May 1, 2006, 
<br>Morales announced GOB nationalization of the hydrocarbons sector. 
<br>Despite the presence of Bolivian troops in hydrocarbons fields, the 
<br>reality was less dramatic. Instead of a traditional 
<br>nationalization, the GOB required companies to sign new contracts 
<br>under duress and gave Bolivia's state oil company YPFB control over 
<br>the entire hydrocarbons chain. The main impact has been to halt new 
<br>investment in the sector, which Bolivia needs to meet domestic 
<br>demand and fulfill contractual obligations to Brazil and Argentina. 
<br>As a political measure, however, the "nationalization" remains 
<br>wildly popular. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (SBU) With respect to the mining sector, high-level GOB officials 
<br>have given repeated assurances that the Morales administration will 
<br>respect existing U.S. mining interests. However, the GOB has 
<br>reiterated threats to nationalize the mining industry, and on 
<br>February 9 took over a smelter owned by Swiss company Glencore 
<br>(which had been sold by ex-President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada). We 
<br>continue to urge the GOB to respect existing mining concessions and 
<br>to limit tax and royalty hikes. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (SBU) Trade is the key to Bolivia's future. Congress' extension 
<br>of Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA) benefits 
<br>was well-received here, ensuring the continuity of thousands of 
<br>jobs. However, high-level GOB officials refuse to take serious 
<br>steps toward a free trade agreement, instead advocating the 
<br>extension of the unilateral trade preferences. We have explained 
<br>that "fast track" trade promotion authority expires in June, and 
<br>that the new U.S. Congress is not likely to extend it. The Morales 
<br>administration, however, continues to want something for nothing. 
<br>
<br>--------------------- 
<br>COCA CASTS SHADOW 
<br>--------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶11. (SBU) The Morales government's mixed results on 
<br>counter-narcotics reflect its confused strategy-encouragement of 
<br>coca cultivation coupled with increased interdiction efforts. 
<br>Despite the Embassy's attempts to focus the relationship elsewhere, 
<br>counter-narcotics is often the negative focal point of the bilateral 
<br>relationship. Given President Morales' leadership of the 
<br>Chapare-based coca federations, this is not surprising. Morales 
<br>repeatedly called for "zero cocaine, not zero coca," drawing a 
<br>distinction between illegal drugs and legal use of coca leaf, which 
<br>is also chewed or brewed as tea. It should be noted that Bolivian 
<br>coca production vastly exceeds licit demand, as the GOB tacitly 
<br>accepts, having refused to proceed with a market study funded by the 
<br>EU which would show just that. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (SBU) Per capita rates of illegal drug use in urban Bolivia 
<br>approach U.S. levels, confirming that Bolivia is a consumer country 
<br>and not merely a producer. Narcotics Affairs Section 
<br>(NAS)-supported demand reduction efforts focus on local and regional 
<br>partners due to central government indifference. NAS- and 
<br>DEA-supported interdiction programs have been successful under the 
<br>Morales government. Comparing 2006 to 2005, cocaine seizures were 
<br>up 23 percent. Destruction of base labs and maceration pits were up 
<br>55 and 54 percent respectively. While Bolivian CN forces have 
<br>improved coordination and efficiency, the increased seizures are due 
<br>in part to increased supply. 
<br>
<br>¶13. (SBU) Anecdotal evidence suggests that coca plantings have grown 
<br>dramatically since Morales' election, edging out other licit and 
<br>less-profitable crops. And just as coca planting has increased, 
<br>eradication is down. The GOB achieved its goal of eradicating 5,000 
<br>hectares in 2006, but has gotten off to a slow start in 2007. The 
<br>Morales government has been unwilling to enforce Bolivian law (or 
<br>informal agreements limiting coca cultivation), has stalled the 
<br>launch of the licit demand study required by Bolivian law, and now 
<br>is considering raising legal limits from 12,000 to 20,000 hectares 
<br>nationwide (to include the Chapare). This increase would place 
<br>Bolivia in violation of its own law and treaty obligations. In an 
<br>attempt to justify increased coca growth, the GOB has announced 
<br>plans to legalize and industrialize coca for use in products such as 
<br>toothpaste, demand for which is notional, at best. 
<br>
<br>---------- 
<br>COMMENT 
<br>---------- 
<br>
<br>¶14. (SBU) Your visit presents an opportunity to further our strategy 
<br>of engagement with the GOB. We have expressed serious concerns 
<br>about the Morales government's commitment to a democracy that 
<br>includes separation of powers, checks and balances, an active 
<br>political opposition and a free press. We continue to emphasize 
<br>that what Morales says matters as much as what he does in terms of 
<br>his attacks on the United States. On counter-narcotics, we have 
<br>continued to support interdiction and eradication efforts, demand 
<br>reduction programs, and capacity building, while engaging in frank 
<br>discussions about the GOB's shortcomings and redirecting our support 
<br>where it has greatest impact, i.e., to interdiction. Via USAID, 
<br>we're spending about $90 million annually to further social and 
<br>economic inclusion of Bolivia's historically marginalized indigenous 
<br>groups and to support democratic institutions and processes, 
<br>including decentralized governance. In addition, USAID encourages 
<br>economic growth for the poor through exports and trade, and also 
<br>provides assistance in the areas of health, alternative development, 
<br>and environmental protection. Your visit provides an additional 
<br>opportunity to encourage Morales to follow a democratic path and to 
<br>respect U.S. mining interests; to take counter-narcotics issues 
<br>seriously and to become a true partner in fighting the flow of 
<br>illegal drugs; and to take advantage of free trade and other 
<br>opportunities, including the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA).
