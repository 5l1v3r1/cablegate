<br>SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED -- HANDLE ACCORDINGLY 
<br>
<br>SUMMARY 
<br>------- 
<br>¶1. (SBU) Nicolas Sarkozy has won France's presidency by a 
<br>clear cut, 53 percent majority. Official results -- 53 
<br>percent of the vote for Sarkozy and 47 percent for Socialist 
<br>Segolene Royal -- were announced by France's Interior 
<br>Ministry 8 P.M. Paris time on Sunday May 6. President Bush 
<br>called president-elect Sarkozy at 8:05 P.M. Paris time to 
<br>congratulate him. A record turn-out of 85 percent of 
<br>registered voters confirms the intense interest this election 
<br>has generated among the French, just as Sarkozy's convincing 
<br>victory confirms their collective decision to endorse the 
<br>market-oriented reform platform that he ran on. END SUMMARY 
<br>
<br>A CLEAR-CUT, CONVINCING VICTORY 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>¶2. Former Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy's second-round 
<br>win over Socialist Party candidate Segolene Royal in France's 
<br>2007 presidential election is, by any measure, a clear-cut, 
<br>convincing victory. Official, if preliminary, results 
<br>announced by France's Interior Ministry at 8 P.M. Paris time 
<br>on Sunday May 6 show that Sarkozy got 53 percent of the 38 
<br>million votes cast and Royal got 47 percent. Final, official 
<br>vote tallies will be posted as they come in on the French 
<br>Interior Ministry's website at http://www.interieur.gouv.fr. 
<br>The participation rate in this election is the highest for a 
<br>second-round presidential contest in France since the 
<br>election of 1981. Of France's 44.5 million registered 
<br>voters, 85.5 percent cast ballots on May 6 for either Sarkozy 
<br>or Royal, or cast null ballots. 
<br>
<br>THAT GIVES SARKOZY A MANDATE 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>¶3. (U) In electing -- by a clear-cut majority -- the 
<br>activist, mold-breaking Sarkozy the French have clearly 
<br>endorsed the largely market-oriented reform agenda that 
<br>Sarkozy ran on. They have also given him a vote of 
<br>confidence, betting that he will grow in office -- and that 
<br>his unsettling, often divisive, personality traits that put 
<br>off so many will be attenuated by the responsibilities of 
<br>office. 
<br>
<br>WHAT HAPPENS NEXT 
<br>----------------- 
<br>¶4. (U) Sarkozy has said that he expects to be inaugurated 
<br>shortly before the end of President Chirac's term, probably 
<br>on Wednesday May 16 (Chirac's five-year term ends at midnight 
<br>on the 16). Sarkozy and Chirac might agree to transfer power 
<br>earlier, possibly as early as May 14. In the interim, 
<br>between his election and inauguration, Sarkozy has promised 
<br>that, accompanied by a small group of advisors, he will take 
<br>some days off to "reflect on the heavy responsibilities 
<br>ahead." Something more than speculation about who will head 
<br>the Sarkozy administration's first government should emerge 
<br>from this "retreat" led by the president-elect. Sarkozy has 
<br>promised that he will try to achieve gender parity in his 
<br>administration's first cabinet. Former Education Minister 
<br>Francois Fillon and current Minister of Social Solidarity 
<br>Jean-Louis Borloo are generally viewed as the two leading 
<br>candidates for the prime minister's slot. In coming days 
<br>president-elect Sarkozy's statements should confirm how, and 
<br>how quickly, he plans to proceed with his reform agenda, and 
<br>we will report accordingly.
