<br>Classified By: EcoPol Chief Mike Hammer for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: The Bolivian government attempted to renew 
<br>and, in some cases, repackage old allegations against the 
<br>U.S. February 16-18. Bolivian President Evo Morales 
<br>threatened to show USAID the door if it continues undermining 
<br>his administration. As proof, Morales provided the example 
<br>of a political organization that was allegedly turned down 
<br>for USAID assistance due to its pro-Morales stance. He also 
<br>cited unnamed groups that were asked to work against the 
<br>government as a condition for assistance. Morales also 
<br>argued against a free trade agreement with the U.S. and 
<br>charged the U.S. of involvement in the disappearances of 
<br>Bolivians during drug-related conflicts in the region of 
<br>Chapare. Morales' assertion that pro-government groups were 
<br>prepared to take up arms to defend his agenda were rebuffed 
<br>by a wide-range of social and labor groups. Government 
<br>Minister Alfredo Rada continues to accuse the U.S. of 
<br>involvement in a police "spying" scandal to deflect from his 
<br>role in the unauthorized surveillance of opposition 
<br>politicians and reporters. The Bolivian government's refusal 
<br>to sign a cooperation agreement concerning U.S. military aid 
<br>and the impact of that refusal on disaster assistance was 
<br>made public February 18. Foreign Minister David Choquehuanca 
<br>explained the government did not want to sign an agreement 
<br>"with its eyes closed" and was only reviewing the agreement. 
<br>Despite public assurances that they want better relations 
<br>with the U.S., the relentless public spinning of the Bolivian 
<br>government's complaints against the U.S. at the expense of 
<br>diplomatic channels suggest the BOG has another agenda: 
<br>discredit the U.S. and distract the Bolivian public. End 
<br>Summary. 
<br>
<br>Lights, Camera, Allegations 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) Bolivian President Evo Morales made several references 
<br>to ongoing "political problems" with the U.S. February 15, 
<br>although he clarified diplomatic and commercial relations 
<br>would be maintained. Morales rehashed the argument that 
<br>USAID is supporting opposition groups and that the U.S. 
<br>Embassy is "making politics" at the expense of diplomatic 
<br>work, such as advancing commercial ties. Morales asserted 
<br>during recent months USAID has been convoking groups through 
<br>implementing NGOs and offering them money with the 
<br>stipulation that they work "against the Bolivian government." 
<br>Morales claimed leaders from the Federation of Ayllus 
<br>(indigenous local government units) of Potosi told him an 
<br>USAID-supported NGO denied their group's request for $20,000 
<br>because the organization "supports Evo Morales." Morales 
<br>urged citizens to report NGOs that are "bought by USAID to 
<br>distribute funds to make politics against the government." 
<br>He added, "The government will not allow NGOs to work against 
<br>the executive power. Faced with these provocations from 
<br>USAID, we will ask them to go home." Morales saluted U.S. 
<br>citizens that are denouncing both USAID and the Embassy for 
<br>practicing "politics," but offered no details on who he was 
<br>referring to. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (U) Although most of his criticisms were respun from old 
<br>charges, Morales added a new spin on some existing 
<br>allegations. Morales asserted Embassy Bolivian police guards 
<br>act "like embassy workers ... at the side of the U.S. 
<br>government." Morales claimed he learned of this "strange" 
<br>police arrangement through Fulbrighter van Schaick, who 
<br>accused Assistant Regional Security Officer Vincent Cooper of 
<br>asking him to "spy" on Cubans and Venezuelans in Bolivia last 
<br>week (Reftels a and b). Though not directly associated with 
<br>recent charges the U.S. is behind Bolivian police "spying" on 
<br>politicians and reporters, this mischaracterization of our 
<br>Bolivian guard force feeds into the Morales administration's 
<br>allegations of undue U.S. influence on Bolivian police units. 
<br>
<br>Evo on FTA, Drugs, and Cooper "Expulsion" 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Morales rejected a free trade agreement with the U.S. 
<br>as a return to the days of former-president Gonzalo Sanchez 
<br>de Lozada, when Morales alleges the government made deals 
<br>with U.S. businesses at the expense of Bolivians. Morales 
<br>characterized the Embassy's decision that ARSO Vincent Cooper 
<br>would not return to Bolivia as the "expulsion" of a "man who 
<br>conducted North American espionage." Morales repeated his 
<br>opinion that the war on drugs has been a failure because it 
<br>targeted coca leaf instead of cocaine. He alleged the DEA, 
<br>U.S. military, and Bolivian national police headed Bolivian 
<br>anti-narcotics efforts "from a U.S. military base" in 
<br>Cochabamba Department when there were "demonstrations and 
<br>disappearances," implying U.S. involvement. (Note: The U.S. 
<br>supports Bolivian anti-narcotics efforts at the Chimore 
<br>Airport and has offices there, but there are no U.S. military 
<br>bases per se in Bolivia. Despite Morales' intermittent calls 
<br>to dismantle such non-existent bases, this issue is a 
<br>misunderstanding or a straw man. End Note.) 
<br>
<br>Call to Arms Disconnected 
<br>------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (U) While railing against "oligarchic groups," and 
<br>particularly efforts to convoke an autonomy referendum in the 
<br>opposition-led Department (state) of Santa Cruz, Morales 
<br>claimed pro-government groups would defend his administration 
<br>"with arms." Morales said February 14 that sympathizers in 
<br>Santa Cruz had told him they would take up arms to ensure the 
<br>opposition showed Morales the proper "respect." However, 
<br>leaders from MAS-aligned social and union groups rejected any 
<br>attempt to resort to arms February 16, calling instead for an 
<br>electoral solution to settle Bolivian differences. 
<br>
<br>
<br>Spin Doctor Rada's Dizzying "Spy" Accusations 
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (U) On February 15, the Ambassador met with Government 
<br>Minister Alfredo Rada to discuss the USG's support to the 
<br>Police's Special Operations Command (COPES) police unit, a 
<br>unit that Rada has stated was likely behind a growing 
<br>domestic surveillance scandal. Following their meeting, the 
<br>Ambassador issued a public statement which re-iterated that 
<br>the USG was never involved in domestic spying and explained 
<br>that USG would no longer fund COPES because the unit had been 
<br>disbanded on January 29. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (U) In an interview with the La Paz newspaper La Prensa 
<br>following the February 15 meeting Rada continued to insinuate 
<br>)- as he has done publicly on various occasions -- that 
<br>COPES was responsible for internal surveillance against 
<br>political officials and journalists. Rada once again called 
<br>COPES a parallel intelligence organization that conducted 
<br>"political intelligence," argued it reported directly to the 
<br>USG and not to the National Intelligence Directorate (DNI), 
<br>and that it exceeded the scope of its mandate. Rada 
<br>explained that since September 11, 2001 the U.S. government 
<br>had directed COPES to gather intelligence on terrorist 
<br>organizations which violated COPES' mission to conduct 
<br>surveillance only on narco-trafficking organizations. Rada 
<br>stated, that "terrorism is a fundamentally political 
<br>phenomenon . . . therefore COPES . . . conducted political 
<br>intelligence . . . All of this a function of the State 
<br>Department's priorities." (Note: According to the COPES' 
<br>memorandum of understanding between the Bolivian and U.S. 
<br>governments, conducting surveillance on both illegal 
<br>narcotics and terrorist targets is part of its mission. End 
<br>Note.) 
<br>
<br>¶8. (U) Throughout the interview Minister Rada engaged in 
<br>double speak, at times strongly insinuating the USG was 
<br>behind the domestic spying scandal, at other times 
<br>acknowledging there was little information tying the USG to 
<br>the case. "It would be irresponsible to affirm they (the 
<br>Embassy) were behind these (domestic spying) operations," 
<br>Rada stated. He followed with, "The fact that intelligence 
<br>personnel from the Embassy received reports from ODEP (COPES' 
<br>official name since 2001) makes us believe that they were 
<br>aware of these things (domestic spying). Despite earlier 
<br>statements in the interview that COPES responded to the USG, 
<br>Rada closed the interview with the statement, "That 
<br>ODEP-COPES followed direct orders from the Embassy, we cannot 
<br>yet demonstrate, but we are investigating. But there was a 
<br>direct economic link, and it has been demonstrated that they 
<br>worked on priorities designed by Washington." Rada also 
<br>tried to link Fulbrighter Van Schaick case to the domestic 
<br>spy scandal. Arguing his Van Schaick's sworn statement is 
<br>the first piece of concrete evidence that links the USG to 
<br>espionage within Bolivia. 
<br>
<br>Eyes Wide Shut on MILGP Assistance 
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) The Bolivian press reported February 19 that the 
<br>Bolivian government had frozen military humanitarian 
<br>assistance, by not renewing our humanitarian assistance 
<br>diplomatic note (which acts as a SOFA, or status of forces 
<br>agreement, for U.S. military personnel in Bolivia). The 
<br>article stressed that non-military aid (USD) 600,000 to flood 
<br>victims is not affected. However, it highlighted that our 
<br>MILGRP has provided humanitarian assistance (include medical, 
<br>dental and eye treatment) since 1996 and has already 
<br>prevented aid from arriving for flooding victims. Foreign 
<br>Minister David Choquehuanca responded that the government had 
<br>not canceled any agreement, but was simply reviewing it. 
<br>Choquehuanca stated, "We now do not sign agreements with the 
<br>United States with our eyes closed, like what happened in the 
<br>past, especially with anti-drug assistance." (Note: The 
<br>humanitarian assistance agreement has nothing to do with our 
<br>counter-narcotics aid. A Bolivian diplomatic note suspended 
<br>renewal of the assistance agreement January 29, citing the 
<br>need for a dialogue to bridge a "gap of understanding." 
<br>((Reftel C)) End Note). 
<br>
<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Although charges that USAID is undermining the 
<br>Bolivian government are nothing new (Minister of the 
<br>Presidency Juan Quintana originally laid out the charges in 
<br>August and officials have drummed them up periodically 
<br>since), Morales' call for Bolivians to help the government 
<br>"identify these NGOs" ostensibly working to undermine his 
<br>administration is a troubling development. Using Morales' 
<br>example of the Potosi group that was "denied" $20,000, any 
<br>person or organization that asks for USAID funding and does 
<br>not receive it could allege a political motive. We will 
<br>continue to counter misunderstandings about USAID's 
<br>transparency and apolitical nature with reality. However, 
<br>the Bolivian government is unlikely to back off from its 
<br>USAID assault any time soon, as it enjoys the propaganda 
<br>value of creating an external enemy to distract from domestic 
<br>problems. Likewise, although government officials have 
<br>privately admitted to us they do not believe the U.S. was 
<br>involved in the police "spying" scandal, they are not 
<br>disengaging from insinuations of U.S. involvement. Rada's 
<br>accusations are designed not to lead to a formal process that 
<br>would prove or disprove them, but rather to create the 
<br>appearance of U.S. impropriety to distract the Bolivian 
<br>public from very real and potentially damaging charges 
<br>against him. As such, they are a success. The incongruity 
<br>of the government accusing us of being in cahoots with the 
<br>opposition and, at the same time, spying on them seems 
<br>largely overlooked in the public discourse. Unfortunately, 
<br>the Bolivian press does not consistently apply critical 
<br>analysis to these incoherent, vague, and sometimes 
<br>contradictory charges before distributing them to the 
<br>Bolivian and international public. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Comment Continued. Although they may not always 
<br>believe in the merits of some of their specific accusations, 
<br>government leaders from Evo down appear to genuinely believe 
<br>the Embassy is working to undermine the Morales 
<br>administration. Given his proclivity to view the Embassy as 
<br>separate from the U.S. government and people, we expect 
<br>Morales to bring the GOB's vague litany of accusations 
<br>against the Embassy to both the visiting Congressional 
<br>delegation and to the U.S. public during his planned February 
<br>25-27 speaking tour in the U.S. End Comment.
