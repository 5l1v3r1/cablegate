<br>SUBJECT: REQUEST TO BRAZIL TO RESETTLE CUBAN MIGRANTS PROTECTED ON GUANTANAMO 
<br>
<br>REF: A. A. SECSTATE 103585 
<br>¶B. B. 2008 BRASILIA 775 
<br>
<br>¶1. On October 16, Poloff delivered reftel demarche and left nonpapers in English and Portuguese with Gilda Mattos Santos Neves, head of the United Nations Division of the Ministry of External Relations (MRE), who promised to shepherd our request through the GOB. Neves said she would check with the National Committee for Refugees (CONARE), under the Ministry of Justice but with MRE representation, which she believed would have the lead. She was concerned, however, that the migrants did not fall neatly into any Brazilian legal category and were not being handled with the intermediation of the UNHCR. Poloff stressed UNHCR support for the resettlement program and the active involvement of IOM. 
<br>
<br>¶2. Neves did not raise any political or diplomatic issues with regard to resettling Cubans in Brazil, and she said she would report back to us after she received the views of CONARE and others in the GOB. 
<br>
<br>¶3. On October 28, Poloff revisited Neves to check on progress with regard to the Cuban migrants. Neves apparently had not received a positive reaction within the GOB and had nothing to report. Based on previous efforts to engage the GOB on this issue (ref B), we do not expect a definitive response. Nonetheless, we will check back periodically. KUBISKE<br>
