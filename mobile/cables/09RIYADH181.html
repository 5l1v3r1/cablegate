<br>SUBJECT: SAUDI EXCHANGE WITH RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR ON IRAN'S 
<br>NUCLEAR PLANS 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: P/M COUNSELOR SCOTT MCGEHEE 
<br>REASONS 1.4 (b) (d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY & COMMENT:  Netherlands Ambassador Ron 
<br>Strikker, Russian Ambassador Victor Gibinvish, and Embassy 
<br>Riyadh Pol/Mil Counselor Scott McGehee met on January 25 with 
<br>Dr. Prince Turki Al-Kabeer, Undersecretary for Multilateral 
<br>Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to deliver a 
<br>joint demarche on the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear 
<br>Terrorism (GICNT).  The meeting evolved into a pointed 
<br>exchange between the Russian Ambassador and Dr. Prince Turki 
<br>on Iran's nuclear ambitions.  Prince Turki warned that if 
<br>Iran tried to produce nuclear weapons, other countries in the 
<br>Gulf region would be compelled to do the same, or to permit 
<br>the stationing of nuclear weapons in the Gulf to serve as a 
<br>deterrent to the Iranians.  Turki then pointedly demanded 
<br>that the US keep Saudi officials informed about US plans for 
<br>Iran. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) Dr. Prince Turki is not a decision-maker, but he is a 
<br>reliable transmitter of official Saudi thinking.  Most of 
<br>what he said is not new, although this is the most explicit 
<br>mention we have heard of Saudi willingness to see nuclear 
<br>weapons deployed in the GCC as a deterrent to Iran.  His 
<br>concern that the United States will negotiate a "grand 
<br>bargain" with Iran without consulting Saudi Arabia is a 
<br>concern we have heard often in recent weeks. End summary & 
<br>comment. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) After hearing a brief verbal demarche from Ambassador 
<br>Strikker on the upcoming June Plenary of the GICNT, Dr. Turki 
<br>turned to Ambassador Gibinvish, saying, "On this issue, what 
<br>concerns us most is how to get our neighbor to change its 
<br>policy on enrichment." Iran needs to be convinced to enter a 
<br>dialogue on this matter, he continued, noting that Saudi 
<br>Arabia is also concerned about the Russian-built reactor at 
<br>Bushehr.  A leakage from a plant at that location could bring 
<br>an environmental catastrophe to Saudi Arabia, pointing out 
<br>that it is located less than 300 kilometers away from Saudi 
<br>shores, across open water. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) Ambassador Gibinvish was able to say only "Sure, I 
<br>agree!" before Prince continued, "The location is so 
<br>dangerous! Not just to us, but to the world economy!"  He 
<br>urged that Russia use its influence to have the reactor moved 
<br>north, suggesting that a location on the shore of the Caspian 
<br>Sea would be much better, where there is water available for 
<br>reactor cooling, and where mountains rise behind to contain 
<br>any possible leakage from moving south.  Perhaps more 
<br>troubling, he said, is Iran's pursuit of nuclear enrichment. 
<br>He explained that if Iran tries to produce nuclear weapons, 
<br>other countries in the Gulf region would be compelled to do 
<br>the same, or to permit the stationing of nuclear weapons in 
<br>the Gulf to serve as a deterrent to the Iranians. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) Amb. Gibinvish responded that Iran's desire to enrich 
<br>uranium reflected its fears that it will someday be attacked 
<br>by Israel or the United States and also a sign of Iran's 
<br>desire to establish its "supremacy" in the region.  Prince 
<br>Turki interjected:  "And we cannot accept Iranian supremacy 
<br>in the region.  We are okay with nuclear electrical power and 
<br>desalination, but not with enrichment."  He said that the 
<br>prospect of Iranian enrichment raises troubling questions 
<br>about their motivations for doing so: "they do not need it!" 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (S) Amb. Gibinvish noted that "some experts in Russia 
<br>believe that Iran will have a bomb in 10 to 15 years." 
<br>Russia, he said, is concerned about this matter as well, and 
<br>has "put forward initiatives" with Iran.  Russia hopes to 
<br>discuss this further with Saudi Arabia in the near future, 
<br>and he said that an "important delegation" would be coming to 
<br>Riyadh in about two months to discuss this with the Saudi 
<br>leadership.  Prince Turki said that the Russian delegation 
<br>would be welcomed, stressing that "we must work together to 
<br>get them to abandon their effort to acquire nuclear weapons. 
<br>Israel too, he said, must be convinced to surrender its 
<br>nuclear arsenal.  But you deal with them, you have influence, 
<br>that is why I raise this with you."  Amb. Gibinvish pledged 
<br>that "we will do what we can.  But the Iranians are difficult 
<br>partners."  At this point, Prince Turki turned to Pol/Mil 
<br>Counselor who had momentarily stopped taking notes.  Prince 
<br>Turki said "Please write this down. Whatever is discussed 
<br>with the Iranians, we must be kept informed!  Any 
<br> 
<br>RIYADH 00000181  002 OF 002 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>negotiations with the Iranians must take into account the 
<br>interests of Saudi Arabia, otherwise, we will not accept it! 
<br>We should be told -- in advance! -- of what you plan to say."
