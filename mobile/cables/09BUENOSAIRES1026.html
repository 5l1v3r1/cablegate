<br>SUBJECT: ARGENTINA: THERE'S LIFE AFTER THE CASA ROSADA FOR
<br>CFK'S FORMER CABINET CHIEF
<br>
<br>REF: BUENOS AIRES 0802
<br>
<br>Classified By: CDA Tom Kelly for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Eight weeks after leaving Argentine President
<br>Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's (CFK) administration, former
<br>Cabinet Chief Sergio Massa told Polcouns that he parted on
<br>good terms with CFK and "not so good terms" with CFK's
<br>husband and power behind the throne, former president Nestor
<br>Kirchner (NK). Massa said that CFK deferred to her husband
<br>on all matters, and that in practice she only took orders,
<br>showing no inclination to overrule her husband's policy
<br>decisions or countermand his orders to government ministers
<br>and their staffs. He said he expected NK to run for
<br>president in 2011. Massa conveyed his own intention to run
<br>for governor in 2011 and indicated he was already building a
<br>team to help him run the province. End summary.
<br>
<br>Back to Running Tigre
<br>---------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Argentine former Cabinet Chief Sergio Massa looked
<br>tanned and well-rested when he met with Polcouns September 4,
<br>a little over a month after returning to Tigre, the
<br>medium-sized city in suburban Buenos Aires where he was
<br>elected mayor in 2007 but took a leave of absence to work one
<br>year for President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner (CFK).
<br>Massa served as Cabinet Chief from July 24, 2008, through
<br>July 8, 2009, and returned to his mayor's office in Tigre two
<br>weeks later. Although the media had reported that Massa took
<br>his family skiing at the southern resort of Bariloche, Massa
<br>grinned when Polcouns asked him about the slopes and
<br>confessed that he had actually taken his family to a beach
<br>resort in northeastern Brazil. He was clearly pleased that
<br>he had pulled a fast one on the media.
<br>
<br>Greatly Relieved
<br>----------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Massa stressed that he did not miss his highly visible
<br>Casa Rosada position one bit. The polls, he said, indicated
<br>he had left the Kirchner administration with his reputation
<br>and popularity intact. Tensions between Massa and former
<br>President Nestor Kirchner were rumored to be high, and Massa
<br>confirmed that to us in private. He claimed he parted on
<br>good terms with CFK and "not so good terms" with CFK's
<br>husband and power behind the throne, former president Nestor
<br>Kirchner (NK). Massa said that CFK deferred to her husband
<br>on all matters, and that in practice she had become nothing
<br>more than a subaltern who took orders and had no ability or
<br>inclination to overrule her husband's policy decisions or
<br>countermand his orders to government ministers and their
<br>staffs. He also said that his replacement as Cabinet Chief,
<br>Anibal Fernandez, 52, seemed to be making more enemies than
<br>allies, and that Interior Minister Florencio Randazzo, 45,
<br>who a year earlier shared the limelight with Massa as one of
<br>CFK's most visible spokesmen, was a spent force in the
<br>administration.
<br>
<br>Kirchner Gearing Up for 2011
<br>----------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Massa described NK as a master tactician who enjoyed a
<br>good fight and was ultimately seized with acquiring and
<br>asserting power for its own sake but did not have a vision
<br>nor the coalition-building skills needed to carry out an
<br>agenda. Massa said he believed NK was intent on running for
<br>president in 2011, and that Daniel Scioli, 52, would run for
<br>re-election as governor of the province of Buenos Aires on
<br>the Kirchner ticket. Asked about rumors that NK and Scioli
<br>might switch -- i.e., Scioli for president, and NK for
<br>governor -- Massa said that might be a fallback plan. He
<br>said Scioli was stuck between a rock and a hard place,
<br>expressing some pity for Scioli's inability to extricate
<br>himself from Kirchner's grasp, particularly as the province
<br>is headed toward a severe fiscal crunch that will require a
<br>bailout from the national government.
<br>
<br>Massa's Plans for 2011
<br>----------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Massa was emphatic that he would not take the
<br>congressional seat he won in the June 28 elections,
<br>preferring instead to establish a strong record as mayor of
<br>Tigre as a launching pad for his own gubernatorial bid in
<br>¶2011. He spoke at length about the need to build a capable
<br>team that he could take with him to govern the province. He
<br>noted that CFK's new minister of economy, Amado Boudou,
<br>seemed to be doomed for disaster because he did not have even
<br>a small team of trusted advisers to help him develop policy
<br>and run that portfolio.
<br>
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) In that connection, Massa said he had hired Santiago
<br>Montoya, the well-regarded former head of the provincial
<br>revenue service (ARBA) who lost his job when he incurred
<br>Kirchner's wrath by refusing to run as a candidate on the
<br>Kirchner slate in the June 28 congressional midterm
<br>elections. Massa also made a point of picking up his cell
<br>phone and calling Emilio Monzo, the provincial agriculture
<br>secretary whom Scioli had fired the week before, also at
<br>Kirchner's behest. Massa's end of the phone conversation
<br>made it clear he and Monzo were on good terms, and at the end
<br>of the conversation, Massa said he was looking to find a
<br>place for Monzo in his city administration.
<br>
<br>Labor Problems in Tigre
<br>-----------------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Polcouns asked Massa about intractable labor problems
<br>at a food processing plant in Tigre owned by Kraft. Massa
<br>said three times that he believed the company had been in the
<br>right when it dismissed 155 workers for failing to show up to
<br>work in July and then taking plant managers hostage in July.
<br>He implied that the labor leaders at the plant were
<br>extortionist and unreasonable. He made clear that he did not
<br>see a useful role for himself in resolving the standoff, and
<br>he was at a loss for predicting how it might end.
<br>
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) As noted reftel, Massa, 37, is smart, charismatic, and
<br>well-liked, with an open, inclusive style that did not fit
<br>well with the paranoid, combative Kirchners. He is generally
<br>pro-American and, unlike others in the GOA, did not resort to
<br>any cheap shots against the United States. Like his
<br>predecessor, Alberto Fernandez, he emerged relatively
<br>unscathed from his service in the Kirchner administration.
<br>He is focused now on positioning himself for the governor's
<br>race in 2011. In the interim, he clearly enjoys his job as
<br>mayor and is highly popular in Tigre. Ambitious and young,
<br>he already has an impressive record of public service (five
<br>years as head of ANSES, the Argentine social security
<br>administration; a year as mayor of Tigre; and a year as
<br>Cabinet Chief). Most likely, he sees himself as a long-term
<br>presidential contender, and we would put him in the same
<br>generational league as other promising presidential prospects
<br>such as Salta governor Manuel Urtubey, 40, and Chaco governor
<br>Jorge Capitanich, 44.
