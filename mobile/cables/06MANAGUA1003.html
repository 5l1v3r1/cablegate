<br>
<br>REF: MANAGUA 1002 
<br>
<br>(SBU) This is the second in a series of three cables 
<br>summarizing the crimes and abuses of power committed by 
<br>Nicaragua's corrupt party bosses and their associates. The 
<br>first cable focused on Daniel Ortega and his family, while 
<br>this one centers on the abuses of the Sandinistas more 
<br>broadly, both when they were in power during the 1980s and 
<br>subsequently. The third and final cable will focus on 
<br>Arnoldo Aleman and his family. As noted in reftel, post 
<br>intends to use the information from these "rap sheets" in 
<br>discussions with domestic and international interlocutors as 
<br>a means of reminding Nicaraguan voters and others of the true 
<br>character of Aleman, Ortega, and the Sandinistas. While the 
<br>summaries themselves are unclassified, some of the sources of 
<br>information are SBU. Post will distribute the summaries to 
<br>appropriate contacts, but not the sources. Post is sending 
<br>both the summaries and the sources to the Department and 
<br>other Washington agencies for similar uses. 
<br>
<br>THE RECORD OF THE 1980S FLSN REGIME AND SUBSEQUENT SANDINISTA 
<br>ABUSES OF POWER 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>Rampant FSLN Human Rights Abuses, including Torture, 
<br>Disappearances, and Murder 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) The FSLN regime declared a permanent "state of 
<br>emergency" and interned and tortured thousands of people at 
<br>prisons and camps scattered all over Nicaragua. The 
<br>Sandinista State Security Directorate operated a network of 
<br>special prisons where those held had no legal rights or 
<br>protections whatsoever. In the mid-1980s, the regime had 
<br>over 6500 political prisoners, the largest number in the 
<br>entire hemisphere. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (U) Many prisoners were held for up to two years without 
<br>ever being charged or facing a judge. The largest torture 
<br>camp for political prisoners was in what is now the free 
<br>trade zone near Managua's airport. The regime also ordered 
<br>numerous murders and disappearances, including the killings 
<br>of hundreds of Miskitos on the Atlantic coast and the 
<br>internment of thousands more in concentration camps in 1981 
<br>and 1982. These crimes against humanity were ordered by 
<br>Daniel Ortega, Humberto Ortega, Tomas Borge, Lenin Cerna, and 
<br>Omar Cabezas, among others. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) Sources: Sandinista declarations on the "state of 
<br>emergency" and their incarcerations of political prisoners 
<br>are a matter of public record; the CPDH human rights 
<br>organization also has tens of thousands of complaints of 
<br>1980s rights abuses and on the imprisonment of political 
<br>prisoners. This information was published in regular reports 
<br>by the CPDH throughout the 1980s and remains documented in 
<br>the organization's archives. The State Department's annual 
<br>Human Rights Reports also documented many of the worst 
<br>abuses. Many victims remain alive to this day and continue to 
<br>testify regarding the abuses they suffered. 
<br>
<br>FSLN Wrecks Economy and Sets it back 50 years 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶5. (U) By the 1970s, Nicaragua had developed one of the most 
<br>advanced economies in Central America, with so many jobs 
<br>being created that workers from other Central American 
<br>countries came to Nicaragua seeking employment. Nicaragua 
<br>was known as the bread basket of the region. When the FSLN 
<br>came to power in 1979 and began confiscating property (over 
<br>170,000 total properties), driving out investors, and setting 
<br>up a state-run soviet-style economy, it destroyed all the 
<br>progress that had been made, setting the national economy 
<br>back at least fifty years. GDP per person declined an 
<br>average of 5.7 percent per year, exports declined 3 percent 
<br>per year, and the Sandinistas ran up Nicaragua's external 
<br>debt to over 10 billion dollars (more than seven times GDP). 
<br>For comparison's sake, external debt in 1979, when the 
<br>Sandinistas took power, was only 1.5 billion dollars (97 
<br>percent of GDP). 
<br>
<br>¶6. (U) Under the Sandinistas, the currency was constantly 
<br>devalued, hyperinflation reached 33,500 percent in 1988, and 
<br>production plummeted, forcing Nicaraguans to suffer shortages 
<br>and rationing of even the most basic goods. Although 
<br>
<br>progress has been made since 1990, the economy has still not 
<br>fully recovered from FSLN mismanagement. Because of the 
<br>FSLN, instead of other Central Americans coming to Nicaragua 
<br>to seek jobs, the country now faces a situation in which 
<br>hundreds of thousands of its people have had to leave their 
<br>country to seek jobs elsewhere. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) Sources: Detailed documentation on the decline of 
<br>the Nicaraguan economy is a matter of public record; all of 
<br>the information is available in the records of the Nicaraguan 
<br>Central Bank. Nicaraguans old enough to remember both the 
<br>pre-Sandinista and the Sandinista economies can also bear 
<br>witness to the economic devastation caused by the FSLN. Based 
<br>on analysis of records from numerous government ministries, 
<br>President Bolanos and his government estimated that the FSLN 
<br>regime set the Nicaraguan economy back at least 50 years. 
<br>
<br>Censorship and Harassment of the Media 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶8. (U) The FSLN regime eliminated nearly all independent 
<br>media in Nicaragua, censored all sensitive information, and 
<br>constantly harassed La Prensa and the two main independent 
<br>radio stations that survived. Journalists were regularly 
<br>arrested and held without charge, La Prensa was shut down on 
<br>numerous occasions, and many journalists and editors were 
<br>forced into exile. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (U) On one occasion, Interior Minister Tomas Borge 
<br>summoned journalist Jose Castillo Osejo to his home and then 
<br>personally physically assaulted him. Castillo, currently a 
<br>National Assembly deputy, was one of the owners of the 
<br>independent Radio Corporacion, and had often used the station 
<br>to criticize the FSLN. At the same time, the regime 
<br>monitored phone calls, opened private mail, and used its 
<br>control of the media, and its famous literacy campaign, to 
<br>bombard the Nicaraguan people with communist propaganda. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (U) FSLN efforts to harass the media have continued even 
<br>since the party left power in 1990. In 2006 the Sandinista 
<br>caucus in the National Assembly rammed through the new Arce 
<br>Law, named for FSLN National Assembly member Bayardo Arce, 
<br>its chief advocate. The law significantly reduced the tax 
<br>exonerations that media outlets may obtain for imported 
<br>materials and equipment. These tax exonerations helped the 
<br>print and other media to keep prices low to enable wide 
<br>access to information. Media outlets reported that the law 
<br>resulted in significant bureaucratic delays that slowed the 
<br>importation of needed printing supplies and equipment. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (SBU) Sources: Any journalist who lived through this 
<br>period in Nicaragua or was forced into exile can testify to 
<br>the effect of FSLN media policies, as Jose Castillo Osejo has 
<br>done. Police records also document the arrest of journalists, 
<br>and La Prensa has reported widely on the constant harassment 
<br>it suffered. The State Department's annual Human Rights 
<br>Report and complaints filed with the CPDH human rights 
<br>organization also document FSLN abuses of the media. 
<br>
<br>Promotion of Terrorism and Efforts to Destabilize Neighboring 
<br>Countries 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶12. (U) The FSLN regime was not content to run Nicaragua 
<br>into the ground, and sought to export its failed communist 
<br>revolution to all of Nicaragua's neighbors and countries as 
<br>far away as Argentina. The regime smuggled weapons to 
<br>leftist guerrillas in El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and 
<br>elsewhere. At the same time, terrorists from all over the 
<br>world found a safe haven in Nicaragua, and many obtaind 
<br>Ncragancitizenship. 
<br>
<br>¶13. (U) FSLN leaders, including Humberto Ortega, have 
<br>admitted publicly that leaders of the Argentine leftist 
<br>terrorist group "Los Montoneros" resided in Nicaragua and 
<br>engaged in military activities with the FSLN for an extended 
<br>period in 1979-1981. Humberto Ortega admitted that Fernando 
<br>Vaca Narvaja, the leader of the group, resided in his house 
<br>in Managua. 
<br>
<br>¶14. (SBU) Sources: Daniel Ortega has publicly admitted many 
<br>of his terrorist connections, including the fact that he has 
<br>received elections money from the government of Libya. Many 
<br>1980s terrorists still live in Nicaragua and have acquired 
<br>
<br>Nicaraguan citizenship (including at least one prominent 
<br>member of the Italian Red Brigades). Daniel Ortega publicly 
<br>associated with many of these individuals in Nicaragua 
<br>throughout the 1980s. 
<br>
<br>Harassment of the Roman Catholic Church and Civil Society 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶15. (U) The FSLN regularly harassed, arrested, and abused 
<br>the Catholic Church and civil society. In August 1982 the 
<br>FSLN set a trap for Monsignor Bismarck Carballo, who ran the 
<br>Church's independent Radio Corporation by luring him to the 
<br>home of a woman who claimed to be having domestic problems 
<br>and needed his help. FSLN thugs assaulted Caballo, stripped 
<br>him naked and then trotted him in front of the national media 
<br>waiting outside in a disgusting effort to discredit the 
<br>priest. In 1983 the FSLN even went so far as to harass Pope 
<br>John Paul II when he visited Nicaragua. The regime tried to 
<br>prevent people from coming to Managua to hear the Pope speak, 
<br>shut off the lights and sound during his public address, and 
<br>placed FSLN agitators at the front of the crowd to shout at 
<br>the Pope throughout his speech. 
<br>
<br>¶16. (SBU) Sources: The harassment and abuse of Monsignor 
<br>Carballo was filmed by the Sandinista media and broadcast 
<br>countrywide. The harassment of Pope John Paul II was also 
<br>filmed and videotapes showing the harassment are now widely 
<br>available. Among other locations, they are sold in stands at 
<br>Managua's airport. 
<br>
<br>Rampant Sandinista Anti-Semitism and Anti-Semitic Violence 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶17. (U) The Nicaraguan Jewish community, which numbered 200 
<br>in the early 1970s, was reduced to approximately 50 
<br>individuals after the Sandinista takeover in July 1979. With 
<br>the support of the Palestine Liberation Organization, an 
<br>anti-Semitic campaign began in 1977 when Sandinistas defaced 
<br>Managua's synagogue with anti-Jewish and anti-Israel slogans. 
<br>In 1978, the same synagogue was firebombed during Saturday 
<br>religious services. Younger members of the congregation were 
<br>forced to evacuate elderly Holocaust survivors while the 
<br>synagogue burned and the Sandinista bombers tried to force 
<br>them all to remain inside the burning building. Many of the 
<br>elderly Holocaust survivors had also lived through the 
<br>November 1938 "Night of Broken Glass" (Kristallnacht), during 
<br>which the Nazi regime orchestrated attacks on Jews, 
<br>Jewish-owned businesses, and Synagogues all across Germany 
<br>and Austria. 
<br>
<br>¶18. (U) After the triumph of the Sandinista revolution in 
<br>1979, Jews who had been residing temporarily outside 
<br>Nicaragua were not permitted to return. When 70-year-old 
<br>Abraham Gorn was identified as the president of the 
<br>Nicaraguan Jewish community, he was jailed for two weeks and 
<br>forced to sweep streets. His factory was expropriated, his 
<br>bank account seized and he was evicted from his home. 
<br>Numerous other members of the Jewish community suffered 
<br>similar forms of harassment. The July 15 and 17, 1982 
<br>editions of the government-controlled newspaper El Nuevo 
<br>Diario denounced Jews. The Sandinista regime labeled Jewish 
<br>houses of worship "Synagogues of Satan." The Sandinistas 
<br>converted Managua's synagogue (the same one they firebombed 
<br>in 1978) into an elite social club for the children of 
<br>high-ranking Sandinista officials. 
<br>
<br>¶19. (SBU) Sources: Testimony of leaders of the Jewish 
<br>community who experienced the Sandinista firebombing of the 
<br>Managua synagogue and other anti-Semitic FSLN acts, State 
<br>Department Human Rights Reports, 1986 Special State 
<br>Department Report: "Human Rights in Nicaragua under the 
<br>Sandinistas", 1986 State Department Publication: "In Their 
<br>Own Words: Testimony of Nicaraguan Exiles." 
<br>
<br>Rigging of Elections 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶20. (U) In 1984 the FSLN held rigged national elections in 
<br>which all other parties withdrew because of blatant 
<br>Sandinista efforts to manipulate and control the outcome. 
<br>Because of the FSLN's "state of emergency" no other party 
<br>was allowed to organize or campaign. Opposition parties were 
<br>censored and subjected to constant harassment, while the FSLN 
<br>subjected the Nicaraguan people to a constant barrage of 
<br>
<br>pro-Sandinista propaganda using all of the state-controlled 
<br>media. FSLN comandante Bayardo Arce, who oversaw the 
<br>fraudulent elections, admitted that they were only held in 
<br>the first place because of pressure from the United States. 
<br>
<br>¶21. (SBU) Sources: The content of the Sandinista "emergency 
<br>decrees" is a matter of public record and was widely reported 
<br>in the media even at the time. Specific abuses and efforts to 
<br>manipulate the outcome of the elections were reported by the 
<br>CPDH human rights organization and the State Department's 
<br>annual Human Rights Report for 1984. 
<br>
<br>Murder of Contras After they Disarm 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶22. (U) After the signing of the 1988-1989 peace accords and 
<br>the holding of free elections in 1990, the fighters of the 
<br>armed resistance ("Contras") to the FSLN regime disarmed as 
<br>the peace accords required. However, the FSLN leadership saw 
<br>this as an opportunity for revenge, and had its assassins 
<br>kill hundreds of Contras, including ordering the murder of 
<br>ex-Contra commander Enrique Bermudez in the parking lot of 
<br>the intercontinental hotel (today's Hotel Crowne Plaza) in 
<br>¶1990. 
<br>
<br>¶23. (SBU) Sources: Such killings are widely documented in 
<br>Nicaraguan police and court records. No one was ever brought 
<br>to justice in the crimes. Right down to the present day, 
<br>friends and family members of Bermudez continue to call for a 
<br>full investigation of his murder. 
<br>
<br>Banning of Independent Unions and Violations of Right to 
<br>Organize and Strike 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶24. (U) Although they proclaimed themselves to be the 
<br>champions of working people, the Sandinistas banned any form 
<br>of union organization or exercise of labor rights that they 
<br>could not control. Those who tried to organize independent 
<br>unions were regularly arrested and beaten, such as Carlos 
<br>Huembes who was severely beaten by FSLN thugs at the Managua 
<br>airport in February 1981, at the same time the FSLN 
<br>vandalized his residence. In September 1981, the FSLN banned 
<br>all strikes. 
<br>
<br>¶25. (SBU) Sources: Many of the FSLN's "emergency decrees" 
<br>specifically restricted the right of people to organize and 
<br>freely express their views, on labor matters or anything 
<br>else. The FSLN's banning of all strikes is thus a matter of 
<br>public record. Carlos Huembes has regularly and personally 
<br>testified as to the abuses he suffered, as have many other 
<br>independent labor leaders. 
<br>
<br>Sandinistas Look out for Themselves and the Wealthy, While 
<br>the Poor Suffer 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶26. (U) Throughout the 1980s Sandinista military 
<br>"recruiters" traveled throughout Nicaragua forcing boys and 
<br>girls as young as twelve years of age to join the Sandinista 
<br>military, often effectively kidnapping them from their 
<br>families and then sending them into combat with minimal 
<br>training. However, only the poor were the victims of such 
<br>FSLN press gangs, as the children of the Sandinista elite and 
<br>the wealthy were largely exempt. 
<br>
<br>¶27. (U) While Sandinista economic mismanagement and 
<br>draconian state controls wrecked the economy and forced most 
<br>Nicaraguans to live in abject poverty and survive on 
<br>extremely limited food rations, the Sandinista elite lived in 
<br>luxury, enjoying the fruits of the property, businesses and 
<br>other economic resources that they had seized when they took 
<br>power. Today, while Ortega and the rest of the Sandinista 
<br>elite reside in mansions and are chauffeured around in 
<br>Mercedes Benzes and other luxury vehicle, this same 
<br>Sandinista leadership promotes strikes that prevent the poor 
<br>from receiving medical care and from having access to public 
<br>transportation. 
<br>
<br>¶28. (U) In October 2005 Sandinista members of the Managua 
<br>city council cut a deal with their PLC colleagues to build 
<br>two expensive monuments to their respective historical 
<br>"heroes" (Jose Santos Zelaya for the PLC and Rigoberto Lopez 
<br>Perez--the assassin who killed the first Somoza in 1956--for 
<br>
<br>the FSLN) at a total cost of 3 million cordobas (USD 175,000) 
<br>in taxpayer money from the city budget, more than the PLC and 
<br>FSLN councilors assigned to all city social programs combined. 
<br>
<br>¶29. (SBU) Sources: Any Nicaraguan old enough to remember the 
<br>1980s can testify about the FSLN "press gangs" that tore 
<br>minors away from their families and forced them to serve in 
<br>the Sandinista army. Thousands of young people fled Nicaragua 
<br>and went into exile to avoid such forced military service. To 
<br>see the current lifestyle of the FSLN elite, one need only 
<br>look at the homes they live in, the cars they drive, and the 
<br>opulence of their lifestyle and travels. It is also widely 
<br>known and reported in the media that Ortega and the FSLN 
<br>control all of the unions and the politically-motivated 
<br>strikes that often make life miserable for ordinary 
<br>Nicaraguans, preventing them from getting to work or 
<br>receiving medical care. 
<br>
<br>Involvement with Drug Traffickers and use of Drug Money for 
<br>Campaign Finance 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶30. (U) Daniel Ortega and the Sandinista have regularly 
<br>received money to finance FSLN electoral campaigns from 
<br>international drug traffickers, usually in return for 
<br>ordering Sandinista judges to allow traffickers caught by the 
<br>police and military to go free. Most of these schemes are 
<br>orchestrated by Lenin Cerna, the former Director of State 
<br>Security, and are supervised by Sandinista Supreme Court 
<br>judges such as Rafael Solis and Roger Camillo Arguello. 
<br>Non-drug traffickers, including corrupt associates of Arnoldo 
<br>Aleman such as Byron Jerez, have also paid bribes to the FSLN 
<br>judicial "campaign finance" machine in return for not guilty 
<br>verdicts. 
<br>
<br>¶31. (U) In one notorious case in 2005 widely reported in the 
<br>media, Supreme Court magistrate Arguello coordinated a 
<br>complicated scheme to make 609,000 dollars in drug money 
<br>seized from two Colombians "disappear" from a Supreme Court 
<br>account. There are credible reports that some of the money 
<br>went to fund upcoming FSLN electoral campaigns, while the 
<br>rest went to individual Sandinista judges, including Solis 
<br>and Arguello. 
<br>
<br>¶32. (U) In another one of many examples, prosecutors have 
<br>accused Rigoberto Gonzalez Garbach, a Sandinista candidate 
<br>for elected office in Puerto Cabezas in the March 2006 
<br>Atlantic Coast regional elections, of attempting to bribe a 
<br>judge with 108,500 dollars in return for freeing convicted 
<br>drug trafficker Marvin Funez. According to prosecutors, this 
<br>was not the first time that Rigoberto Gonzalez Garbach had 
<br>tried to bribe judges to free drug traffickers. 
<br>
<br>¶33. (U) In 1984 Daniel Ortega negotiated a deal with 
<br>Colombian drug kingpin Pablo Escobar whereby Escobar received 
<br>refuge for several months in Nicaragua after he had ordered 
<br>the killing of the Colombian Minister of Justice. At the 
<br>same time, Escobar's drug trafficking operation received 
<br>Ortega's approval to land and load airplanes in Nicaragua as 
<br>they sought to ship cocaine to the United States. In return, 
<br>Ortega and the FSLN received large cash payments from 
<br>Escobar. Interior Minister Tomas Borge and his subordinates 
<br>went so far as to assist Escobar with the loading and 
<br>unloading of drugs onto his airplanes in Nicaragua. The Drug 
<br>Enforcement Agency (DEA) managed to place a hidden camera on 
<br>one of Escobar's airplanes and obtained film of Escobar and 
<br>Ministry of the Interior officials loading cocaine onto one 
<br>of Escobar's planes at Managua's international airport. CBS 
<br>news later broadcast the film and the entire story of 
<br>Escobar-Ortega-FSLN collaboration is related in detail in a 
<br>2005 book by Astrid Legarda Martinez: El Verdadero Pablo: 
<br>Sangre, Traicion y Muerte (Colombia, Ediciones Dipon). 
<br>
<br>¶34. (SBU) Sources: Everyone in Nicaragua knows that Ortega 
<br>and the FSLN control the judiciary, with at least 75 percent 
<br>of all judges being self-described Sandinista militants. The 
<br>specific cases described above have all been widely reported 
<br>by media all across the political spectrum. Although his name 
<br>does not often appear in the media, everyone in Nicaragua's 
<br>political circles knows that Lenin Cerna remains Daniel 
<br>Ortega's chief political "fixer." The Pablo Escobar footage 
<br>was filmed June 24, 1984. The media have widely reported on 
<br>the FSLN's use of the judiciary for campaign finance purposes 
<br>and credible confidential sources have confirmed the practice 
<br>
<br>on numerous occasions. 
<br>
<br>FSLN Condones and Supports Domestic and Sexual Violence 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶35. (U) In 1998 Zoilamerica Narvaez, the daughter of Rosario 
<br>Murillo and the step-daughter of Daniel Ortega, made 
<br>allegations that Ortega had raped and sexually abused her 
<br>over a period of many years. However, Ortega used his 
<br>immunity as a National Assembly deputy and his control of the 
<br>courts to ensure that the case never went to trial. Having 
<br>ensured he would never face trial, Ortega then actively 
<br>sabotaged all efforts by the Nicaraguan government to provide 
<br>justice to Narvaez and used his mother and Rosario Murillo in 
<br>a public relations campaign intended to bury the allegations. 
<br>
<br>¶36. (U) In September 2004, boxer Ricardo Mayorga allegedly 
<br>raped a young woman in a Managua hotel. Sensing an 
<br>opportunity to blackmail Mayorga, Ortega and the FSLN agreed 
<br>to protect the boxer in the courts if he would give the party 
<br>a large portion of his international boxing winnings and 
<br>"advertise" for Daniel in public. Mayorga agreed, and an 
<br>FSLN judge found him not guilty in December. Much of 
<br>Mayorga's winnings now reportedly go to Ortega, and when 
<br>Mayorga fought in Chicago in August 2005, he dedicated the 
<br>fight to Daniel, wore the FSLN colors, and flashed the number 
<br>of the FSLN slot on the electoral ballot ("casilla") to the 
<br>international media. 
<br>
<br>¶37. (U) Such misogynistic attitudes are common in the FSLN, 
<br>as is the tolerance of domestic and sexual violence. When 
<br>FSLN National Assembly deputies voted to lower the criminal 
<br>penalties for statutory rape in March 2006, FSLN deputy 
<br>Nathan Sevilla justified the vote by stating that sex with 
<br>minors was "normal" in rural Nicaragua and thus should not be 
<br>considered a serious crime. 
<br>
<br>¶38. (SBU) Sources: personal testimony of Zoilamerica, legal 
<br>documents filed by Zoilamerica in Nicaraguan institutions 
<br>(including the courts, the police and the office of the Human 
<br>Rights Ombudsman) and the IACHR, media records of Ortega's 
<br>"public relations" campaign using Rosario Murillo and his own 
<br>mother. Sources for the Mayorga case include media accounts 
<br>of Mayorga's arrest, trial, his public "pro-Daniel" comments 
<br>and his August 2005 fight, private testimony offered by 
<br>lawyers involved in the case, and the testimony of the rape 
<br>victim. Sevilla's comments were widely reported in the media.

<br>FSLN Continues to Use Land and Property "Pinatas" for 
<br>Campaign Finance

<br>
<br>¶39. (U) As has been widely reported in the Nicaraguan media, 
<br>in addition to using its control of the judiciary to campaign 
<br>finance from drug traffickers, the FSLN is still involved in 
<br>numerous land and property "pi$atas" that bring huge amounts 
<br>of money into party coffers. Although the FSLN uses a 
<br>variety of scams to rob both domestic and foreign property 
<br>owners and investors, the most common technique seems to be 
<br>to have FSLN lawyers bring spurious charges of violations of 
<br>oral labor "contracts" against property owners and companies. 
<br>FSLN judges then rule in favor of the lawyer making the 
<br>complaint, and issue huge judgments for damages against the 
<br>property owner, or simply seize the property in question and 
<br>hand it to the Sandinista lawyer for use or sale. The 
<br>resulting profits go straight to FSLN coffers. In other 
<br>cases seized properties have been spuriously "auctioned" to 
<br>the FSLN at no cost. 
<br>
<br>¶40. (U) Among those attacked by the FSLN money-making 
<br>machine in this manner have been international investors from 
<br>Spain and the United States, as well as government entities 
<br>such as the Nicaraguan Basic Foodstuffs Company (Enabas). In 
<br>some cases, such as that of the Spanish investors, the 
<br>properties in question have been worth over one and a half 
<br>million dollars. In another case involving Sandinista judges 
<br>in Catarina, the FSLN acquired buildings and property worth 
<br>700,000 dollars in the same manner. 
<br>
<br>¶41. (SBU) Sources: These cases have been widely reported in 
<br>all of the Nicaraguan media since they became public 
<br>knowledge in February 2006. The victims in the various cases 
<br>have all publicly testified regarding the FSLN legal 
<br>shenanigans to defraud them.
