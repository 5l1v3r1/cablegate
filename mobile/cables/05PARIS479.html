<br>INVESTIGATION

<br>
<br>Classified By: POLITICAL MINISTER COUNSELOR JOSIAH ROSENBLATT, FOR REAS 
<br>ONS 1.4 B/D 
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) Summary: French media reported on January 26 the 
<br>arrest two days prior of seven people suspected of 
<br>involvement in recruiting and sending French residents to 
<br>fight Coalition forces in Iraq. The Embassy also learned 
<br>that an additional four suspects were arrested in the morning 
<br>of January 26. These are the first arrests since the 
<br>investigation of French jihadists going to Iraq was begun in 
<br>September 2004. End summary. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) After French officials spent most of 2004 publicly 
<br>denying that French citizens might be going to Iraq, the 
<br>Paris Prosecutor's office ordered the opening of an 
<br>investigation in September 2004. Investigating judges 
<br>Jean-Louis Bruguiere and Jean-Francois Ricard were given 
<br>investigative authority. As reported reftel, the judges were 
<br>initially cautioned to be circumspect in their investigations 
<br>because of GOF fear that the investigation might harm two 
<br>French journalists held hostage in Iraq. The hostages were 
<br>released December 21, 2004. When last queried about the 
<br>investigation in early January, Ricard told Poloff that the 
<br>investigation was progressing, although authorities had no 
<br>indication of a distinct "network" sending Islamic radicals 
<br>to Iraq. Rather, they believed that the jihadists to Iraq 
<br>benefited from more informal support through local mosques 
<br>and families. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) In a lunch hosted by the Ambassador on January 24 
<br>(reported septel), Bruguiere revealed that several suspects 
<br>had been arrested that morning in connection with the 
<br>investigation. He added that in examining the case, he had 
<br>come across reports of the involvement of minors as young as 
<br>13-years-old. Two days later, the French press reported 
<br>these arrests and added additional detail. According to the 
<br>press reports, the DST (France's internal security service) 
<br>arrested seven people on January 24, three who were planning 
<br>to go fight in Iraq and four suspected of recruitment and 
<br>fundraising. Two of the seven are reported to be women. The 
<br>press reported that those arrested were affiliated with the 
<br>Adda'wa mosque in Paris' 19th arrondisement. Four French 
<br>citizens reported killed in Iraq had ties with mosques in the 
<br>19th arrondisement, and three of them had frequented the 
<br>Adda'wa mosque. An unnamed "high-level" Interior Ministry 
<br>official quoted in the reporting said police and security 
<br>services benefited from increased surveillance powers 
<br>included in the recently enacted Perben II law. (Comment: 
<br>This unnamed offical, probably a member of Interior Minister 
<br>Villepin's Cabinet, also lauded the counter-terrorism 
<br>policies enacted by Villepin as being instrumental in the 
<br>arrests. That is a stretch, given that Villepin did not 
<br>figure in the passing of Perben II or the assigning of the 
<br>case to the counter-terrorism investigating judges. End 
<br>comment.) 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) Ricard (strictly protect) told Poloff January 26 that, 
<br>in addition to the seven arrested on January 24, an 
<br>additional four were arrested on January 26. He said that 
<br>none of those arrested was under 18, although some would 
<br>probably be implicated in recruiting minors for jihad in 
<br>Iraq. Of the eleven arrested, he said 3-4 were of "special 
<br>interest" to French authorities. Depending on the results of 
<br>the DST's interrogations, the others would either be released 
<br>or charged with relatively minor crimes. Ricard said the 
<br>investigation was ongoing and could involve additional 
<br>arrests. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (U) Minimize considered.
