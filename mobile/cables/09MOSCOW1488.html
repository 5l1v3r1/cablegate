<br>SUBJECT: ISRAELI FM LIEBERMAN IN MOSCOW 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Political M/C Alice G. Wells for reasons 1.4 (b/d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Israeli FM Lieberman's June 2-3 visit to 
<br>Russia appears not to have broken new ground diplomatically, 
<br>but cemented Moscow's impression that the Russian-speaking 
<br>Lieberman is one of their own.  The trip included meetings 
<br>with Medvedev and Putin, as well as a lengthy discussion with 
<br>FM Lavrov, during which Lieberman indicated that Israel was 
<br>not considering a military strike on Iran.  Both sides agreed 
<br>to hold off on scheduling the Moscow ME conference until 
<br>after President Obama's visit to Moscow, and Lavrov quizzed 
<br>Lieberman on a possible U.S. plan to bring together Israeli 
<br>and Palestinian leaders.  Lieberman rebuffed Lavrov's calls 
<br>for Israel to ease the pressure on Gaza and halt settlement 
<br>expansion, while Lavrov agreed to consider Lieberman's 
<br>request for Russian officials to visit the Israeli soldier 
<br>held by Hamas.  Lavrov said that "nothing new" could happen 
<br>on Iran until the U.S. opened its dialogue with Tehran, and 
<br>repeated Russian concerns about the need to reach a 
<br>negotiated settlement with this "important neighbor."  He 
<br>reiterated that Russia had not transferred S-300s to Iran, 
<br>but also had to consider its contract to provide the missiles 
<br>to Tehran.  Lavrov thanked Israel for limiting military sales 
<br>to Georgia, but thought other countries were supplying 
<br>offensive weapons to Tiblisi, which could be emboldened to 
<br>start "another adventure."  The FMs discussed expanding 
<br>bilateral economic ties, and Lavrov raised Russian concern 
<br>that Israel was partaking in "historical revisionism" that 
<br>sought to blame Russia for the Ukrainian famine of the 1930s. 
<br> End summary. 
<br> 
<br>Behaved Like an Old Friend 
<br>-------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) Israeli DCM Yuval Fuchs told us that FM Lieberman's 
<br>June 2-3 visit to Russia ran the gamut of international and 
<br>bilateral issues, from the peace process to the payment of 
<br>Soviet-era pensions to Russian speakers living in Israel. 
<br>His visit centered upon a two-hour June 2 meeting with FM 
<br>Lavrov that Fuchs characterized as a standard presentation of 
<br>views, during which "nothing breathtaking" was said. 
<br>Lieberman had a hectic day that began with a meeting at 
<br>Medvedev's home on the outskirts of Moscow, then the Lavrov 
<br>meeting at the MFA, a flight to St. Petersburg on a chartered 
<br>plane to see Putin, and dinner with Lavrov upon returning to 
<br>Moscow.  On June 3, Lieberman had breakfast with former FM 
<br>Igor Ivanov (a personal friend), meetings with the heads of 
<br>the Duma and Federation Council international affairs 
<br>committees, discussions with Russian Jewish leaders, and a 
<br>press conference.  He then departed Moscow for Minsk. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) Fuchs explained that Lieberman conducted his meetings 
<br>in Russian, shared stories about Moscow, and smoked, creating 
<br>a comfortable atmosphere with his Russian interlocutors.  The 
<br>Israeli FM "behaved like an old friend" commented Fuchs, who 
<br>thought that the Russians acted as if they already knew him, 
<br>although it was too early to say whether this personal 
<br>diplomacy would have a measurable effect on already strong 
<br>Russia-Israel relations. 
<br> 
<br>Lavrov-Lieberman 
<br>---------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) Fuchs said that during the meeting with Lavrov, the 
<br>GOR's planned Moscow ME conference was not a central topic 
<br>for either side.  Lieberman stressed the importance of 
<br>coordinating such efforts with the U.S., and said it would 
<br>not be appropriate to set the timing of a conference until 
<br>after President Obama's visit to Moscow.  Lavrov agreed, and 
<br>said that Moscow did not want to hold a conference that would 
<br>not produce results.  Lavrov asked Lieberman if Israel was 
<br>aware of an idea supposedly floated by S/E Mitchell to bring 
<br>together Israeli and Palestinian leaders; Lieberman said no. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) Lavrov pressed Israel to open checkpoints into Gaza, 
<br>and suggested posting international monitors to allay Israeli 
<br>concerns regarding smuggling.  When Lavrov argued that Hamas 
<br>had stuck by the Gaza cease-fire, Lieberman retorted that 
<br>Hamas would break the cease-fire when it believed doing so 
<br>suited its needs.  Lavrov also pressed Israel to freeze the 
<br>settlements, leading Lieberman to respond that "life goes on" 
<br>and settlement expansion was necessary to accommodate growing 
<br>communities. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) Fuchs said that Lavrov criticized the U.S. on several 
<br>fronts, telling Lieberman that the U.S. invasion of Iraq was 
<br>a "present" to Iran, and the U.S. decision to isolate Syria 
<br>was a "setback" for a comprehensive ME settlement. 
<br>Furthermore, the U.S. failure to "listen" to Russia, which 
<br> 
<br>MOSCOW 00001488  002 OF 002 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>advised against Palestinian elections, had allowed Hamas to 
<br>come to power and eventually take over Gaza, thereby 
<br>strengthening Iran's position in the region. 
<br> 
<br>Syria 
<br>----- 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) Lavrov thought that the Turkish-led negotiations 
<br>between Israel and Syria had been positive, and said that 
<br>during his recent visit to Damascus, the Syrians indicated 
<br>that they were ready to renew talks either through Turkey or 
<br>Russia so long as they would include the future of the Golan 
<br>Heights.  Lavrov said that he raised with Hamas leaders the 
<br>need to allow visits to captured IDF soldier Gilad Shalit. 
<br>Lieberman asked if Russian officials could visit Shalit, and 
<br>Lavrov directed DFM Saltanov to explore this possibility. 
<br> 
<br>Iran 
<br>---- 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (C) Lavrov predicted that "nothing new" would happen with 
<br>Iran until after the U.S. began its dialogue with Tehran, 
<br>although he thought there was a better chance to get a "clear 
<br>answer" from Iran on P5 1 proposals under the current U.S. 
<br>Administration.  He reiterated that Russia did not believe 
<br>there existed hard evidence that Iran's nuclear program had a 
<br>military dimension, and thought it transparent enough to 
<br>detect whether resources were directed to military uses. 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C) Lavrov expressed Russian interest in reaching a 
<br>negotiated solution to the crisis surrounding Iran's nuclear 
<br>program, and the need for the West to normalize relations 
<br>with Tehran, a close Russian neighbor with which it shared 
<br>the Caspian and its resources.  He raised Russian concern 
<br>that an Israeli attack on Iran would cause instability in the 
<br>region and an influx of refugees into the Caucasus.  Fuchs 
<br>said that Lieberman responded that Israel "was not talking 
<br>about such a response" and understood that an attack would 
<br>cause a "chain reaction" within the region.  Lieberman made 
<br>similar statements suggesting that Israel was not considering 
<br>attacking Iran during his press conference. 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (C) Lavrov reiterated that Russia and Iran had signed a 
<br>deal to provide S-300s, but that Russia had not transferred 
<br>any weapons.  The GOR did not intend to provide regionally 
<br>destabilizing weapons, but also had to take into account how 
<br>it would be perceived by others if Moscow failed to fulfill 
<br>its contract with Tehran. 
<br> 
<br>Georgia 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (C) Lavrov expressed Russian appreciation for Israeli 
<br>steps to limit arms sales to Georgia to defensive weapons, 
<br>but raised concern that other countries were supplying 
<br>offensive weapons.  He was also concerned that the recent 
<br>military exercises Georgia conducted with NATO might push 
<br>Tiblisi to undertake "another adventure". 
<br> 
<br>Bilateral Issues 
<br>---------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (C) Fuchs said that much of the discussion between Lavrov 
<br>and Lieberman focused on expanding bilateral ties, especially 
<br>in the economic sphere.  They also touched upon parochial 
<br>issues of concern to Lieberman and his constituents, such as 
<br>the payment of pensions owed by the Soviet Union and Russia 
<br>to Russian-speaking Israelis. 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (C) Lavrov raised Russian concern with "historical 
<br>revisionism" regarding the Soviet Era and Second World War, 
<br>which, he said, was particularly acute in Eastern Europe but 
<br>was also present in Israel.  He cited Israel's official 
<br>recognition of the Holodomor, the 1930s famine that occurred 
<br>in Ukraine.  Lieberman explained that by recognizing this 
<br>tragedy, Israel had not said Russia was guilty of causing it, 
<br>nor that it was an act of genocide.
