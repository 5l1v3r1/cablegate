<br>
<br>Classified By: CHARGE d'AFFAIRES JOHN P. CAULFIELD, REASONS 1.4 (B) AND
<br>(D)
<br>
<br>¶1. This message is the end of tour analysis of the political
<br>situation in Venezuela by Embassy Deputy Political Counselor
<br>Dan Lawton.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Summary. Despite President Chavez's professed
<br>allegiance to socialism, his political project lacks any
<br>consistent ideology. Instead, the Venezuelan president
<br>exercises an increasingly authoritarian playbook that ensures
<br>his unquestioned, indefinite leadership and concentrates more
<br>and more power in his hands. The Government of the
<br>Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (GBRV) aggressively defends
<br>its democratic legitimacy at the same time that it targets
<br>key opposition leaders, polarizes society along political and
<br>class lines, and hypes the existence of external and internal
<br>enemies to justify repressive measures. Chavez's preference
<br>for loyalty over competence, creation of parallel Bolivarian
<br>institutions, efforts to forge a one-party state, and
<br>chest-thumping nationalism also smack of creeping
<br>totalitarianism. Overall, Chavismo poses a serious threat to
<br>democracy not just in Venezuela but throughout the region,
<br>and it directly competes against U.S. influence in Latin
<br>America. Moreover, it is becoming ever more difficult to
<br>begin any dialogue with a GBRV increasingly consumed by its
<br>own solipsistic "revolutionary" fervor and outsized ambition.
<br>End Summary.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------
<br>One - There Is Only One Great, Indispensable Leader
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) President Chavez has carefully cultivated his own
<br>personality cult, such that for most Venezuelan voters,
<br>President Chavez embodies Chavismo. Outsized billboards and
<br>posters of Chavez dominate public buildings as well as the
<br>rallies and campaigns of his United Socialist Party of
<br>Venezuela (PSUV). Venezuelans can buy a wide range of Chavez
<br>paraphernalia from Chavez action figures to Chavez watches to
<br>a compact disc of Chavez singing Venezuelan folk songs. He
<br>dominates all state media, which also broadcast his Sunday
<br>"Alo, Presidente" talk show. Chavez regularly requires all
<br>local television and radio networks to carry his speeches
<br>("cadenas"); he has wracked up over 1200 such hours (50 days)
<br>on the air. He has not groomed any successor and he
<br>frequently rebukes even his most trusted advisors publicly.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) In pursuing the elimination of presidential term
<br>limits, Chavez declared publicly numerous times that he is
<br>indispensable to his Bolivarian Revolution. While voters
<br>rejected his constitutional reform package in December 2007,
<br>he succeeded in winning public approval of the elimination of
<br>term limits for all elected offices in the February 2009
<br>referendum. Chavez has repeatedly stated that he plans to
<br>govern at least until 2020. A corollary to the Venezuelan
<br>president's protagonism is that there can be no Chavismo
<br>without Chavez. No Chavez supporter who has broken with
<br>Chavez has prospered politically. The formerly pro-Chavez
<br>Podemos party is all but broken after opposing Chavez's 2007
<br>constitutional reform package. Former Defense Minister Raul
<br>Baduel also spoke against indefinite reelection; he is
<br>currently sitting in a Caracas military prison awaiting trial
<br>on corruption charges.
<br>
<br>----------------------
<br>Two - Centralize Power
<br>----------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Chavez's "Socialism of the 21st Century" exalts the
<br>government's active role in the economy and vilifies
<br>capitalism, but in the minds of most Venezuelans, it remains
<br>a vague notion of a state bearing benefits. The thread that
<br>most consistently ties together Chavez's political project is
<br>the increasing concentration of power in his hands. Chavez
<br>has firm control over all the other branches of government.
<br>The opposition foolishly boycotted National Assembly
<br>elections in 2005, and currently only approximately 15 former
<br>government supporters do not automatically support Chavez in
<br>the 167-seat unicameral legislature. With few exceptions,
<br>the judiciary rules in favor of the executive branch, even in
<br>civil cases bereft of political implications.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Chavez is also squeezing state and local governments
<br>from above and below. He recently promulgated a law that
<br>allows the central government to take state control over
<br>ports, airports, and highways. The central government has
<br>done just that in states run by opposition governors.
<br>
<br>CARACAS 00000750 002 OF 004
<br>
<br>
<br>Moreover, Chavez created an appointed position to take over
<br>virtually all the functions and budget of the opposition
<br>mayor of Caracas. The National Assembly is considering
<br>creating presidentially appointed regional vice presidencies
<br>that would undermine elected governors. The Venezuelan
<br>president also created community councils nationwide which
<br>are registered by and report directly to the Office of the
<br>Presidency. Chavez diverted 30 percent of state and local
<br>discretionary development funds to these community councils.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------
<br>Three - Hype External and Internal "Enemies"
<br>--------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Chavez insists on depicting the United States (which
<br>he habitually refers to as "The Empire") as Venezuela's
<br>enemy. Although most Venezuelans are not anti-American,
<br>Chavez's radical foreign policy plays to his base of firm
<br>supporters and serves as a convenient rallying cry during
<br>Venezuela's frequent elections. Although he holds virtually
<br>absolute power in Venezuela, Chavez tries to reframe public
<br>perceptions by depicting himself as David fighting Goliath,
<br>usually the United States, but also occasionally Spain,
<br>Colombia, or Israel. Chavez and other senior GBRV leaders
<br>have tempered this script somewhat since the election of
<br>President Obama. They tend to praise the President and
<br>Secretary personally, while quickly adding that "imperial"
<br>political power continues to be exercised in the United
<br>States by big business, the military establishment, and the
<br>CIA.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Although domestic opposition to Chavez is weak and
<br>disunited, Chavez and senior GBRV officials regularly accuse
<br>it of plotting to overthrow or assassinate the Venezuelan
<br>president in coordination with the United States. The GBRV
<br>does not produce proof or in most cases actually pursue
<br>charges; such allegations conveniently serve to circle the
<br>wagons within Chavismo, to prevent across-the-aisle political
<br>dialogue, and to discredit the opposition. The GBRV
<br>regularly reminds voters that large sectors of the opposition
<br>participated in the short-lived 2002 coup to give greater
<br>credence to current "threats." Chavez also accuses the
<br>opposition of doing the USG's bidding, calling them
<br>"pitiyanquis." Moreover, government supporters regularly
<br>accuse opposition-oriented press outlets of "media
<br>terrorism," essentially building the case for continued
<br>government harassment of the vestiges of independent media.
<br>
<br>---------------
<br>Four - Polarize
<br>---------------
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Railing against the "oligarchs," Chavez exploits class
<br>divisions in stratified Venezuela for political gain. By
<br>playing almost exclusively to the over 70% of Venezuelans who
<br>are poor, Chavez has maintained a reliable electoral majority
<br>(with the exception of the 2007 constitutional referendum
<br>vote when many Chavistas abstained). He is not only
<br>channeling government resources to the economically
<br>disadvantaged, but also prioritizing the GBRV's role in the
<br>economy at the expense of the private sector. Such policies
<br>squeeze the middle class and are feeding a growing brain
<br>drain of professionals, sectors of society traditionally
<br>associated with the opposition. They also increase citizens'
<br>economic dependence on the GBRV.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Politically, Chavez tolerates no middle ground.
<br>Although increasingly large numbers of voters consider
<br>themselves politically neutral, most Venezuelans still
<br>habitually self-identify themselves as either with "the
<br>process" or against. Moreover, the GBRV has a good idea
<br>where most voters stand. Those that signed the 2004 recall
<br>referendum soon found themselves on the infamous "Tascon
<br>List" by which the GBRV discriminated in terms of government
<br>jobs, contracts, and other benefits. In his speeches, Chavez
<br>frequently cites mentor Fidel Castro, bellowing in stark
<br>terms, "With the revolution, everything; outside, nothing."
<br>After its most recent registration drive, the PSUV claims
<br>over seven million members. Local analysts believe the PSUV
<br>party list is becoming the "reverse Tascon List" -- if your
<br>name is not on it, you cannot expect to get government
<br>services (at least not without paying intermediaries).
<br>
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>Five - Insist on Democratic Credentials
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Senior GBRV leaders insist that "participatory"
<br>
<br>CARACAS 00000750 003 OF 004
<br>
<br>
<br>democracy is superior to "representative" democracy. They
<br>contend that real democracies give priority to "social
<br>rights" and argue that concepts such as checks and balances
<br>and institutional autonomy are discredited "bourgeois"
<br>concepts. Chavez also regularly stresses that he has held
<br>national elections almost yearly since he was first elected
<br>in 1998, blurring any distinction between being elected
<br>democratically and governing democratically. Anxious to
<br>preserve their democratic legitimacy at home and abroad,
<br>Chavez and senior GBRV officials lash out immediately and
<br>disproportionately to any criticism of GBRV abuses. They
<br>traditionally dismiss any criticism as interference in
<br>Venezuela's domestic affairs and insult or try to discredit
<br>any government or organization that faults the GBRV (without
<br>ever engaging on the substance of the critique). The GBRV
<br>forcibly expelled a Human Rights Watch leader and a member of
<br>the European Parliament when they publicly took issue with
<br>the GBRV's human rights record while in Caracas.
<br>
<br>
<br>------------------------------------
<br>Six - Reward Loyalty Over Competence
<br>------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) The single most important common characteristic of
<br>Chavez's ministers and other senior officials is their
<br>unquestioning loyalty to the Venezuelan president. He tends
<br>to rotate a small coterie of firm supporters through senior
<br>positions, simultaneously rewarding his inner circle while
<br>preventing them from accruing either real expertise or an
<br>independent power base. A substantial portion of Chavez's
<br>appointed officials participated in his failed 1992 military
<br>coup. Moreover, Chavez retains loyalists despite their poor
<br>administrative or electoral track records. He named
<br>Diosadado Cabello, who last year lost his re-election for the
<br>Miranda Governorship, to be Minister of Infrastructure and
<br>Telecommunications. Chavez appointed Jessie Chacon
<br>Information Minister after he lost the mayoral race in the
<br>Sucre borough of Caracas. By contrast, Chavez's PSUV
<br>temporarily expelled Henri Falcon, the then widely hailed
<br>competent mayor of Barquisimeto, only to quickly reinstate
<br>him after it became obvious that Falcon would win the
<br>governorship of Lara State in 2008 with or without the PSUV's
<br>endorsement.
<br>
<br>---------------------------
<br>Seven - Repress Selectively
<br>---------------------------
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) The GBRV picks its political victims carefully,
<br>making examples of sector leaders. Such calibrated
<br>repression has so far avoided any significant public backlash
<br>while at the same time created a climate of fear in civil
<br>society and fostered self-censorship in the media. Examples
<br>abound. The GBRV recently pressed corruption charges against
<br>Maracaibo Mayor and 2006 consensus opposition presidential
<br>candidate Manuel Rosales; Rosales fled to Peru where he was
<br>granted asylum. The GBRV jailed Carlos Ortega, the leader of
<br>the largest opposition trade union confederation. He escaped
<br>from military prison in 2006 and was also granted asylum in
<br>Peru. The GBRV closed the only critical free-to-air
<br>television network in 2007 and is threatening to do the same
<br>to opposition-oriented cable news network Globovision.
<br>Prominent electoral NGO Sumate has been subject to numerous
<br>government investigations. Chavez and other senior GBRV
<br>officials have blasted prominent Catholic Church officials
<br>for defending democracy, and pro-Chavez thugs briefly
<br>occupied the Cardinal's residence in downtown Caracas.
<br>
<br>----------------------------------
<br>Eight - Create Parallel Structures
<br>----------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) Over the last ten years, the GBRV and its supporters
<br>and allies have created new bodies and institutions in an
<br>effort to undermine and outflank organizations that it could
<br>neither control nor co-opt. Domestically, the GBRV and its
<br>adherents have spawned pro-government NGOs, business groups,
<br>labor unions, television and radio networks, and even a
<br>socialist spin-off of the Catholic Church. Chavez's social
<br>programs ("misiones") generally sidestep and starve long
<br>established government ministries of resources.
<br>Internationally, Chavez is endeavoring to establish
<br>multilateral organizations that both magnify Venezuela's
<br>influence and combat purported "U.S. imperialism." From the
<br>GBRV's perspective, ALBA, Petrocaribe, UNASUR, and the Bank
<br>of the South are tools with which to supplant or weaken the
<br>OAS, IMF, and the World Bank.
<br>
<br>CARACAS 00000750 004 OF 004
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>-------------------------
<br>Nine - Party Equals State
<br>-------------------------
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) Since creating the United Socialist Party of
<br>Venezuela (PSUV) in 2007, President Chavez has been trying to
<br>forge a one-party state. Chavez uses government resources,
<br>especially state media, and pressures the over two million
<br>government employees to support the Venezuelan president,
<br>PSUV candidates, and his referendum proposals during
<br>elections. The National Electoral Council (CNE) staffs PSUV
<br>registration drives. Chavez demanded that all pro-government
<br>parties join the PSUV, but three parties, the Communist Party
<br>(PCV), Patria Para Todos (PPT), and the Podemos party,
<br>declined. Podemos later joined the opposition in 2007. The
<br>PSUV declined to support any PPT or PCV gubernatorial and
<br>mayoral candidates in the 2008 state and local elections and
<br>neither party now exercises any meaningful local power.
<br>Moreover, the National Assembly is seriously considering an
<br>electoral law that would almost certainly expand the PSUV's
<br>absolute legislative majority and diminish the influence of
<br>the PPT and PCV after the 2010 parliamentary elections.
<br>
<br>----------------------------
<br>Ten - Monopolize Nationalism
<br>----------------------------
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) Calling himself the heir to Venezuelan founder Simon
<br>Bolivar, Chavez asserts exclusive claim to Venezuela's
<br>forefathers and national symbols. He regularly cites Bolivar
<br>and other national heroes out of context, insisting that they
<br>were early socialists. One of Chavez's stock stump speech
<br>messages is that his Bolivarian Revolution liberated
<br>Venezuela from being an American colony and will make
<br>Venezuela a world power in coming decades. In contrast,
<br>Chavez and his supporters depict the opposition as
<br>unpatriotic, stateless, or paid U.S. agents. Chavez's own
<br>exaggerated demonstrations of patriotism conveniently
<br>distract public attention from local problems or demonstrate
<br>incontrovertibly that he can do what he wants. In 2006,
<br>Chavez added a star to the Venezuelan flag and flipped the
<br>horse on the national seal to make it run left, not right.
<br>In 2007, he eliminated three zeros from the currency and
<br>changed its name from "bolivars" to "strong bolivars." He
<br>also added the prefix "People's Power" to all ministries and
<br>ordered all Venezuelan clocks changed by thirty minutes to
<br>create a unique Venezuelan time zone. In 2008, he suggested
<br>that he would exhume Bolivar's body to prove that he was
<br>poisoned (He has not done so yet).
<br>
<br>-------
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶17. (C) The increasingly authoritarian nature of Chavismo,
<br>not to mention its habitual and politically convenient
<br>vilification of the United States, pose considerable
<br>challenges to any effort to improve bilateral ties. Chavez
<br>and other senior GBRV officials publicly express interest in
<br>greater dialogue with the USG, but the reality is that to
<br>date, the GBRV has been reluctant to create meaningful and
<br>easily accessible channels of communication, let alone engage
<br>substantively on issues that should be of common interest.
<br>The GBRV also makes it clear that it will not accept or look
<br>past any USG criticism, however well-founded or required by
<br>congressionally-mandated reports or testimony. Facing no
<br>checks on his power at home, Chavez craves international
<br>attention and influence abroad. Whether it is funneling arms
<br>and money to the FARC, sending suitcases of money to the
<br>Kirchner campaign in Argentina, or exporting elements of
<br>Chavismo to ALBA countries, to name just a few prominent
<br>examples, Chavez's outsized ambition backed by petrodollars
<br>makes Venezuela an active and intractable U.S. competitor in
<br>the region.
