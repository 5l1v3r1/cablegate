<br>-------
<br>Summary
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) President Hugo Chavez currently faces the conundrum of
<br>whether he can maintain a leadership style of exploiting
<br>resentment among Venezuela's poor while extolling the
<br>benefits of a seven-year revolution, according to anti-Chavez
<br>psychiatrist Roberto de Vries. De Vries describes
<br>Venezuelans' emotional states as two minority extremes --
<br>revenge for Chavistas and desperation for the opposition --
<br>that ride herd on a disappointed and depressed majority.
<br>Chavez easily drives the Venezuelan political and social
<br>scene with his messianic tendencies and mastery of emotional
<br>manipulation. Despite this, de Vries believes Chavez'
<br>charisma is starting to wane, both for lack of a genuine
<br>opponent and growing expectations among his traditional
<br>constituency. We present this as one person's analysis of
<br>developments in Venezuela, though de Vries is clearly
<br>tailoring his psycho-political theories for desperate
<br>opposition audiences. Post has noticed, however, that Chavez
<br>has seemed off his game of late, appearing more irritable and
<br>explosive. End summary.
<br>
<br>------------------------------------
<br>The Psycho-Social State of Venezuela
<br>------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Dr. Roberto de Vries is a psychiatrist and public
<br>commentator who has written extensively on the psychological
<br>aspects of Venezuelan life, including politics. He told
<br>Poloff March 3 that, prior to the rise of Bolivarianism,
<br>Venezuelans were, in psychological terms, "happy" to the
<br>point that they ignored the decaying social environment
<br>around them. Candidate Hugo Chavez was able, however, to
<br>whip up latent resentment and frustration among the poor to
<br>achieve a remarkable electoral victory. After seven years of
<br>political turmoil, he said, society is fragmented with
<br>radical minorities (about 10 percent each) occupying the
<br>extremes of the political spectrum dominating the debate.
<br>The pro-Chavez extremists he describes as having "happiness
<br>in anger," or revenge, those who enjoy watching Chavez stick
<br>it to the former ruling class. On the opposition side, de
<br>Vries said, are those who experience "sadness with fear,"
<br>which translates to desperation and often leads to
<br>politically imprudent actions. This is why Chavez routinely
<br>takes actions that heighten their fears, such as threatening
<br>to prosecute various members of the opposition.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) The majority of Venezuelans, de Vries said, experience
<br>"sadness with anger." These people feel disappointment,
<br>whether in the failed promise of Chavez to deliver or for
<br>opposition leaders to find a way to rid Venezuela of Chavez.
<br>This explains, he argued, why most Venezuelans seem to have
<br>no reaction to often outrageous statements and actions by
<br>both sides in the political fight. This behavior leads to
<br>depression and, in the case of individuals, could suggest
<br>suicidal tendencies. In the case of a large population, de
<br>Vries said, it could cause instability and unexpected
<br>outbreaks of violence.

<br>-------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) De Vries described "image of power" that he emits to
<br>the public. (Note: Obviously, de Vries has never examined
<br>Chavez directly, which limits his analysis to secondhand
<br>accounts.) Chavez' physical appearance, the "first
<br>impression," allows him to relate simultaneously to white,
<br>indigenous, and African Venezuelans. His style of speech is
<br>
<br>CARACAS 00000751 002.2 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>hard and fast, which de Vries said comes from Chavez' desire
<br>to be perceived as an ardent revolutionary. Chavez likes
<br>being seen as a "victimario," loosely translated as the one
<br>who exacts revenge on behalf of others, like an executioner.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) De Vries emphasized Chavez' "emotional intelligence"
<br>as his greatest strength -- and weakness. Chavez can
<br>instinctively read and manipulate the emotions of individuals
<br>and groups. Chavez, de Vries said, can also make people feel
<br>like they are in the majority or the minority, as
<br>appropriate, which affects their self-perception. (De Vries
<br>noted the irony that Chavez is actually speaking from the
<br>elite minority of a new ruling class when he pitches his
<br>message to the poor masses.) The catch is that Chavez lacks
<br>maturity and often cannot control his own emotions, which
<br>explains his tendency to spout off the moment he feels his
<br>authority challenged. De Vries said Chavez will even become
<br>depressed himself if his emotions get the best of him, like
<br>when his own constituency rejects his more outlandish
<br>statements.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Ideologically, Chavez wants to project an image of a
<br>"utopian socialist," which de Vries described as someone who
<br>is revolutionary, collectivist, and dogmatic. In reality, de
<br>Vries argues, Chavez is an absolute pragmatist when it comes
<br>to maintaining power, which makes him a conservative.
<br>Coupled with Chavez' self-love (narcissism), sense of
<br>destiny, and obsession with Venezuelan symbolism, this
<br>pragmatism makes Chavez look more like fascist, however,
<br>rather than a socialist. Morally, Chavez combines a sense of
<br>tragedy and romanticism (a desire for an idyllic world) to
<br>project a messianic image. De Vries, however, said Chavez is
<br>a realist who uses morals and ethics to fit the situation.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) De Vries said that Chavez has two principal fears:
<br>rejection and anonymity. His fear of rejection comes, said
<br>de Vries, from Chavez' early childhood in which he was
<br>reportedly rejected by his father (and with whom he is
<br>reportedly not close today). Chavez also suffered
<br>humiliation and rejection as a child from degrading jobs like
<br>having to sell candy on the street. His related fear of
<br>anonymity is a fear that he will prove to be irrelevant to
<br>history. De Vries said this explains why Chavez has
<br>established a leadership structure in which he is the final
<br>decisionmaker, and even micro-manager.
<br>
<br>-----------------
<br>Falling Charisma?
<br>-----------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) De Vries argued that Chavez' domination of the
<br>Venezuelan state is making it more difficult to use
<br>resentment and revenge to motivate core supporters. Poor
<br>Venezuelans, de Vries claimed, are not seeing the results of
<br>Chavez' promised revolution and are starting to slip into the
<br>"disappointed" majority, where loyalty is gained with
<br>deliverables. But Chavez cannot satisfy their needs, de
<br>Vries contended, because it would require him to act as a
<br>conciliator and governor, taking him away from the
<br>revolutionary image from which he draws strength. De Vries
<br>said this contradiction, made manifest by the meager voter
<br>turnout in last December's legislative elections, is taking
<br>its toll on Chavez. He opined that Chavez has limited his
<br>public appearances since December and has lashed out publicly
<br>against criticism from his own supporters.

<br>
<br>¶9. (C) De Vries caters his analysis to the opposition crowd,
<br>a fact which should be taken into account in assessing his
<br>observations. But we have noticed of late some new
<br>irritability in Chavez, including publicly lashing out at
<br>
<br>CARACAS 00000751 003 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>supporters who are not showing him the respect he thinks he
<br>deserves. Chavez has also given some of the shortest
<br>speeches of his life in recent months. We are in no
<br>position, however, to assess his state of mental health.
<br>Generally speaking, however, de Vries' analysis is compelling
<br>because Chavez is seeking, with some success, to re-found
<br>Venezuelan society into one that increasingly revolves around
<br>him. His personality quirks, therefore, will no doubt play
<br>an increasing role in how the Bolivarian Republic of
<br>Venezuela is governed.
