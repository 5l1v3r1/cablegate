<br>SUBJECT: (S/NF) FUNES'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FMLN 
<br>(C-AL9-01786) 
<br>
<br>REF: A. STATE 93069 
<br>¶B. SAN SALVADOR 789 
<br>Classified By: Charge d'Affaires, for reasons 1.4 (b), (c), and (d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) Embassy San Salvador provides the following 
<br>responses to Reftel queries. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) DOES MINISTER OF DEFENSE PAYES HAVE CLOSE RELATIONS 
<br>WITH FMLN HARDLINERS? IF SO, WITH WHOM? No. Munguia Payes, 
<br>both during the campaign and since becoming Minister of 
<br>Defense, has been quick to point out to Embassy interlocutors 
<br>that he fought against the guerrilla forces that later formed 
<br>the FMLN during his time in the Salvadoran Armed Forces. 
<br>Indeed, Munguia Payes seems to see himself as the sole 
<br>cabinet-level official in a security position without divided 
<br>loyalties between Funes and the FMLN. However, he has a 
<br>cordial/correct relationship with the FMLN hardliners in the 
<br>GOES. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) WHAT IS VICE PRESIDENT SALVADOR SANCHEZ CEREN'S 
<br>CURRENT RELATIONSHIP WITH FMLN HARDLINERS? We have no 
<br>evidence to suggest that longstanding ties between Sanchez 
<br>Ceren and FMLN Coordinator General (and head of legislative 
<br>bloc) Medardo Gonzalez, Jose Luis Merino, Sigfrido Reyes, and 
<br>other hard-line elements of the FMLN have changed. However, 
<br>the heavy schedule Sanchez Ceren keeps as Minister of 
<br>Education and Vice President, along with persistent rumors of 
<br>health problems, suggest he has less time to devote to party 
<br>business than when he was head of the FMLN's bloc in the 
<br>Legislative Assembly. It is very troubling that on September 
<br>26 Sanchez Ceren made anti-American statements at an FMLN 
<br>rally in support of Manuel Zelaya. The GOES is wrestling 
<br>with Sanchez Ceren's inconsistency when wearing his VP hat as 
<br>opposed to his FMLN hat. HOW DOES HE GET ALONG WITH FUNES? 
<br>Sanchez Ceren's relationship with Funes grew from nearly 
<br>non-existent to a working relationship during the campaign. 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX recently told PolCouns that Funes and Sanchez
<br>Ceren did not talk "as much as I would like" but  that when they 
<br>did talk, it was productive and that the two  seemed to get along
<br>well together. The two almost never  appear together in public. 
<br>Also, in early September, Funes  countermanded a decision by
<br>Sanchez Ceren regarding  agriculture subsidies. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) IS FUNES CONSIDERING CONFRONTING FMLN HARDLINERS 
<br>WHOM HE BELIEVES ARE UNDERMINING HIM? HOW IS FUNES COPING 
<br>UNDER STRESS? XXXXXXXXXXXX  told PolCouns 
<br>September 22 that the divorce between Funes and the FMLN wa
<br> final,  pointing to the lack of public conflict as convincing 
<br>evidence: the two sides are no longer even trying to work 
<br>together. XXXXXXXXXXXX  is convinced FMLN hard-liners
<br>smuggled  Honduran President Zelaya into Tegucigalpa
<br>September 21  without the knowledge of Funes and in direct
<br>defiance of his  efforts to keep the Honduras conflict from playing
<br>out on  Salvadoran soil. XXXXXXXXXXXX believes the relationship
<br>is beyond  repair. We believe that Funes distrusts the orthodox
<br>FMLN,  but is not able to break with the party at this time. He has 
<br>some valuable FMLN "lite" members of his cabinet, and would 
<br>risk more active subversion and street protests if he broke 
<br>with the party. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) WHO ARE CURRENTLY THE MOST INFLUENTIAL FMLN 
<br>LEADERS? HOW DO THEY VIEW FUNES? HOW DOES FUNES VIEW THEM? 
<br>WHAT PLANS DO THEY HAVE, IF ANY, TO STRENGTHEN THE FMLN'S 
<br>INFLUENCE? FMLN General Coordinator Medardo Gonzalez, 
<br>PARLACEN Deputies Jose Luis Merino and Nidia Diaz, and 
<br>Salvadoran Assembly Deputy Sigfrido Reyes continue to hold 
<br>significant power within the FMLN. Hato Hasbun, now 
<br>Secretary for Strategic Affairs in the presidential staff, 
<br>straddles both worlds as an FMLN insider and Funes 
<br>confidante. Within the hard-line faction of the FMLN, it 
<br>appears the influence of the BRV and Hugo Chavez is on the 
<br>rise, with some in the FMLN capitalizing on the crisis in 
<br>Honduras to widen the breach between Funes and party 
<br>hard-liners. Samayoa was recently introduced (by phone) to 
<br>Havana's new Charge d'Affaires and believes the Cubans are 
<br>planning to raise their profile in El Salvador. FMLN 
<br>hard-liners engineered Funes' selection as a pragmatic step 
<br>to gain power, expecting they would eventually govern through 
<br>Funes as their puppet. Funes made a pragmatic decision to 
<br>run for President on the FMLN ticket, expecting to govern 
<br>despite the opposition he expected would emerge from radical 
<br>elements of the party. San Salvador's political pundits 
<br>continue to speculate that the Friends of Mauricio (now being 
<br>rebranded the Citizen Movement for Change) will soon merge 
<br>with the FMLN's smaller ally CD (Democratic Change) giving 
<br>them a base to win seats in 2012 legislative elections and a 
<br>power base from which to negotiate. El Salvador's 
<br>conservative business class continues to assess that working 
<br>with Funes is the best avenue for protecting Salvadoran 
<br>democracy and their own business interests in the long run. 
<br>A senior executive XXXXXXXXXXXX told PolCouns September
<br>22 he thought Funes  would wind up governing with the support of
<br>ARENA and other  conservative parties before his term was up. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) HAVE KEY SECURITY ORGANIZATION BUDGETS
<br>CHANGED? IF  SO, TO WHAT EXTENT? Funes' Private Secretar
<br> told us (Ref  (B)) the President was disappointed in Eduardo Linares,
<br>new  Director of the Salvadoran State Intelligence Organization 
<br>(OIE). In fact, Funes has privately commented on his 
<br>complete lack of faith with Linares and the OIE, whom Funes 
<br>believes to be beholden to the hard-line factions of the 
<br>FMLN. Given Funes' disappointment in and distrust of 
<br>Linares, Funes has decided to shift a significant part of 
<br>OIE's intelligence collection duties to the El Salvador Armed 
<br>Forces (ESAF). Even so, the CY2010 budget for the ESAF was 
<br>reduced USD 6 million from its CY2009 level of USD 132 
<br>million, a significant decrease considering over 90 percent 
<br>of the budget is directed to salaries. Accordingly, Funes 
<br>plans to also gradually reduce OIE's budget to further 
<br>marginalize the Agency's ability to operate effectively. 
<br>Hato Hasbun has told us he envisages OIE evolving into a more 
<br>analytical than operational organization. Other sensitive 
<br>reporting suggests a pending realignment of the GOES 
<br>intelligence apparatus. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S/NF) HOW DO AVERAGE SALVADORANS SEE FUNES'S ACTIONS TO 
<br>REDUCE CRIME, SPECIFICALLY THE MURDER RATE, IN THE COUNTRY? 
<br>DO FMLN HARDLINERS IN GOVERNMENT VIEW THE ISSUE AS A KEY 
<br>PRIORITY? WHAT IS THE MOST RECENT OFFICIAL HOMICIDE RATE? 
<br>Salvadoran press reported September 29 that as of September 
<br>28, the number of murders in 2009 (3,182) had already 
<br>exceeded the 2008 total (3,179). This represents an 
<br>annualized total of 4,286 killings if the current rate holds, 
<br>or almost 12 per day in 2009 compared to a rate of nearly 9 
<br>per day in 2008. This uptick in the homicide rate seems to 
<br>have shocked even those Salvadorans who had grown numb to the 
<br>persistently high levels of violence in their country. 
<br>September polling numbers from the University of Central 
<br>America's IUDOP polling institute suggest a majority of 
<br>Salvadorans are concerned about public security but remain 
<br>willing to give the Funes Administration time to address the 
<br>problem. 58.6 percent of respondents believe crime is 
<br>growing worse since Funes took office, while 26.5 percent 
<br>believe it is about the same and only 14.9 percent believe it 
<br>is improving. Respondents were almost evenly split as to 
<br>whether Funes' public security policies represent more of the 
<br>same (48.9 percent) or a change (49.9 percent) from policies 
<br>of the Saca administration. 67.8 percent of respondents 
<br>believe Funes' security policies will have some or a 
<br>significant effect on crime, while 32.3 percent believe they 
<br>will have little or no effect. However, 51.9 percent of 
<br>respondents thought Funes' public security policies were 
<br>having little to no effect while 48.0 percent believed they 
<br>were, in fact, showing results already. FMLN hardliners are 
<br>concerned more with obtaining operational control over the 
<br>PNC than they are with reducing the crime rate. The 
<br>biographies of some of these hardliners include involvement 
<br>in murder (Melgar, Sanchez Ceren, Nidia Diaz), kidnapping 
<br>(Sanchez Ceren), and arms trafficking (Merino), so their 
<br>commitment to law and order cannot be easily assumed.
