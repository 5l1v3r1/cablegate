<br>SUMMARY 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) The CEO of a British mining company described to us 
<br>how high-ranking Zimbabwean government officials and 
<br>well-connected elites are generating millions of dollars in 
<br>personal income by hiring teams of diggers to hand-extract 
<br>diamonds from the Chiadzwa mine in eastern Zimbabwe. They 
<br>are selling the undocumented diamonds to a mix of foreign 
<br>buyers including Belgians, Israelis, Lebanese, Russians and 
<br>South Africans who smuggle them out of the country for 
<br>cutting and resale elsewhere. Despite efforts to control the 
<br>diamond site with police, the prospect of accessible diamonds 
<br>lying just beneath the soil's surface has attracted a swarm 
<br>of several thousand local and foreign diggers. The police 
<br>response has been violent, with a handful of homicides 
<br>reported each week, though that number could grow as diggers 
<br>arm themselves and attract police and army deserters to their 
<br>ranks. END SUMMARY 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br>High-Ranking Officials Trading Diamonds 
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) On November 6, poloff met with Andrew Cranswick, the 
<br>CEO of African Consolidated Resources (ACR), the 
<br>publicly-traded British firm that had its Chiadzwa diamond 
<br>claim in the Marange district of Manicaland seized by the 
<br>government parastatal Minerals Marketing Corporation of 
<br>Zimbabwe (MMCZ) in 2006 (reftel). According to Cranswick, 
<br>there is a small group of high-ranking Zimbabwean officials 
<br>who have been extracting tremendous diamond profits from 
<br>Chiadzwa. Cranswick said that RBZ Governor Gideon Gono, 
<br>Grace Mugabe, wife of President Robert Mugabe, Vice President 
<br>Joyce Mujuru, Mines and Mining Development Minister Amos 
<br>Midzi, General Constantine Chiwenga and wife Jocelyn, CIO 
<br>Director Happyton Bonyongwe, Manicaland Governor Chris 
<br>Mushowe, and several white Zimbabweans, including Ken Sharpe, 
<br>Greg Scott, and Hendrik O,Neill, are all involved in the 
<br>Marange diamond trade. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) On October 14, econ specialist traveled to the 
<br>periphery of the no-go area around the Chiadzwa diamond site 
<br>located about 60 km southwest of Mutare in Manicaland. 
<br>Repeated inquiries about who was involved in the diamond 
<br>trade elicited many of the same names mentioned by Cranswick. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Econ specialist also met with Manatsawani Mutasa, a 
<br>ZANU-PF Central Committee member and Manicaland resident, who 
<br>added that Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa, Women's 
<br>Affairs Minister Oppah Muchinguri, and Sabina Mugabe--sister 
<br>of President Mugabe--have also been profiting from the 
<br>purchase and sale of Chiadzwa diamonds. 
<br>
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br>How the Chiadzwa Diamond Trade Works 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) The GOZ possesses the diamond mining rights to 
<br>Chiadzwa, but the Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation 
<br>(ZMDC) does not do any extraction itself. The ZMDC brought 
<br>in some mining equipment in 2006 after seizing the mining 
<br>rights from ACR, but their efforts were minimal and soon 
<br>halted altogether. According to Cranswick, all extraction is 
<br>now being done by hand panners who merely sift the top meter 
<br>of soil. Some of these panners operate in teams that sell 
<br>
<br>HARARE 00001016 002 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>their diamonds to representatives of the above-named 
<br>officials and connected elites. Other panners are individual 
<br>operators who merely sell to the highest bidder. Often the 
<br>panners who are affiliated with a particular regime buyer, 
<br>will only sell a portion of their diamonds to that person's 
<br>representative, holding back the remainder to sell for higher 
<br>prices to foreign buyers offering hard currency. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) The diamonds that are sold to regime members and 
<br>elites are sold for freshly printed Zimbabwean notes issued 
<br>by the RBZ. These diamonds are aggregated and resold to 
<br>foreign buyers for US dollars or rand in nearby Mutare, in 
<br>Harare, over the border in the Mozambican towns of Manica and 
<br>Chimoio, or even in South Africa. (NOTE: Econ specialist 
<br>reported that Mutare was awash with diamond money. The 
<br>Holiday Inn was booked with guests checking in for weeks at a 
<br>time. Food prices in shops near Marange were exorbitant, with 
<br>meat prices four times higher than in Harare. END NOTE.) 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) The diamonds that are not sold to regime members and 
<br>elites, but instead are sold directly to foreign buyers, 
<br>actually constitute the majority of the diamond trade in 
<br>Chiadzwa. Cranswick said that around 85 percent of the 
<br>diamonds extracted from Chiadzwa are sold directly to foreign 
<br>buyers. Even so, he conservatively estimated that Mujuru, 
<br>Gono and the rest were probably each making several hundred 
<br>thousand dollars a month. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Whether bought first by regime members or not, 
<br>eventually the diamonds are sold to a mix of Belgians, 
<br>Israelis, Lebanese (the largest contingent), Russians, and 
<br>South Africans. A well-known buyer named Gonyeti fronts for 
<br>Gono, as do two other buyers named Tendai Makurumidze and 
<br>Takunda Nyaguze, according to Mutasa. Once sold to 
<br>foreigners, the majority of the diamonds are smuggled to 
<br>Dubai and sold at the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre 
<br>Authority, a dedicated economic free-trade zone created in 
<br>2002 for the exchange of metals and commodities, most notably 
<br>gold and diamonds. Although Zimbabwe is a participant in the 
<br>Kimberley process, the diamonds from Chiadzwa are 
<br>undocumented and therefore are not in compliance with 
<br>Kimberley, which requires loose uncut diamonds to be 
<br>certified. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) The highest quality diamonds are not sent to Dubai, 
<br>but are shipped to Belgium, Israel, or South Africa for 
<br>cutting. Despite this wide dispersal, Chiadzwa diamonds are 
<br>very distinctive because of their age, color, and clarity and 
<br>can easily be traced back to the Marange mine, according to 
<br>Cranswick. He implicated Ernie Blom, president of South 
<br>Africa's Diamond Merchants Association in the illicit trade 
<br>of Chiadzwa diamonds, and said that Blom had been known to 
<br>boast of his involvement in illegal Zimbabwean diamonds. 
<br>When asked why purportedly reputable diamond dealers would 
<br>involve themselves in Chiadzwa, Cranswick said that the site 
<br>was "massive" with tremendous profit potential that was 
<br>attracting numerous buyers. One such group consisted of 
<br>Russians who had recently bought US$500,000 worth of diamonds 
<br>at an MMCZ auction, paying US$29/carat. They bought eight to 
<br>ten carat rough diamonds, five to ten percent of which were 
<br>gem quality. 
<br>
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>Diamond Trade a Violent Business 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) The diamond frenzy in Chiadzwa has led to hundreds 
<br>and possibly thousands of homicides. Word of easy diamonds 
<br>spurred a rush of Zimbabwean and foreign diggers to the area 
<br>including Angolans, Congolese, Mozambicans, South Africans 
<br>and Zambians, as well as diggers from as far away as Sierra 
<br>
<br>HARARE 00001016 003 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>Leone and Cote D'Ivoire Cranswick estimated there are 
<br>currently around three or four thousand diggers swarming over 
<br>the 70 hectare Chiadzwa site. The police have unsuccessfully 
<br>tried to prevent the site from becoming overrun, and 
<br>routinely use live fire to chase away diggers. Anyone trying 
<br>to enter the area has to present a Zimbabwean national 
<br>identification card with a registration number that ends in 
<br>"75", signifying the person is a resident of the Mutare 
<br>region of Manicaland. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) During the first weekend of November, police killed 
<br>at least five panners in Chiadzwa, according to the on-line 
<br>newspaper Zimbabwe Times. While usually operating on foot 
<br>with attack dogs, this time the police used a helicopter to 
<br>shoot at panners. Passmore Nyakureba, a lawyer with the 
<br>Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights said, "This has become an 
<br>everyday scenario. Up to five people die every week as a 
<br>result of being shot at by police or after being bitten by 
<br>dogs." Cranswick said that at the peak of the frenzy in 
<br>2007, up to a hundred panners were shot in a week. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) In response to aggressive police action, diggers 
<br>began arming themselves with handguns and in some cases 
<br>automatic weapons. They also formed loose gangs in an 
<br>attempt to protect themselves as well as "claimed" areas. 
<br>Cranswick said that some members of the police and army have 
<br>deserted in order to join the digging, and they typically 
<br>brought their firearms with them. Some former police even 
<br>still wear their uniforms as they search for diamonds. 
<br>
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br>Police Corrupted; Community Destroyed 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Cranswick said that the police were rotated into the 
<br>area on two-week shifts to control the mining and keep 
<br>unauthorized diggers out, but they were immediately 
<br>corrupted. Police officers routinely charged 100 rand or 
<br>US$10 a person for a day's digging in Chiadzwa. The military 
<br>has largely avoided the area out of fear that commanding 
<br>officers would lose control of their troops, according to 
<br>Cranswick. 
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) Cranswick maintained that local chiefs were on ACR's 
<br>side in its pending court battle to win back its claim. They 
<br>realized that the "curse" of diamonds had wreaked havoc in 
<br>the community. Children were no longer attending school, the 
<br>environmental degradation was severe, lawlessness and 
<br>violence reigned, and the community was not benefiting from 
<br>the resource. According to an independent weekly newspaper, 
<br>three quarters of the schools in Marange, Buhera, and 
<br>Chimanimani districts failed to open this term because 
<br>teachers and students alike were digging for diamonds. 
<br>
<br>---------------- 
<br>What's At Stake? 
<br>---------------- 
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) Chiadzwa has the potential of being a major source 
<br>of industrial and gem quality diamonds. What makes it so 
<br>commercially valuable is that it possesses a diverse mix of 
<br>different size and color stones, all within just a few meters 
<br>of the surface. It also has a high carat per hundred tons 
<br>(CPHT) ratio, a measure the industry uses to characterize the 
<br>diamond concentration. Cranswick told us he was 
<br>confidentially shown a report prepared for the De Beers 
<br>Corporation by noted geologist John Ward. The report 
<br>estimated that Chiadzwa had a CPHT of over 1,000. By 
<br>comparison, the Rio Tinto/Rio Zimbabwe-owned Murowa diamond 
<br>mine near Zvishavane in Midlands province has a CPHT of 120. 
<br>
<br>
<br>HARARE 00001016 004 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) Eye witnesses and panners told us that they were 
<br>extracting both industrial and gem quality stones, but 
<br>predominantly the former. Cranswick believed that the site 
<br>had 30 to 40 percent industrial diamonds and the rest gem 
<br>quality, including very good quality five to 30 carat colored 
<br>diamonds. In his view, the area could be commercially 
<br>exploited for five to 25 years, including excavation of 
<br>diamond yielding hard rock that ran deeper than the one meter 
<br>depth currently being worked. Econ specialist also was told 
<br>that another diamond field was discovered this year within 
<br>five km of Chiadzwa at the village of Chirasika. Panners had 
<br>begun working the site and it had not yet become a 
<br>police-restricted area. We have no estimates for the 
<br>potential of this new diamond discovery. 
<br>
<br>¶17. (C) On October 27, Gono publicly declared that the 
<br>Zimbabwean economy could be turned around by stemming losses 
<br>caused by illegal mining at Chiadzwa. According to Gono, "A 
<br>reliable estimate shows that US$1.2 billion per month would 
<br>be realized from diamond sales in the country, enough to 
<br>solve the economic challenges the country is currently 
<br>facing." Cranswick said that while the estimate is probably 
<br>exaggerated, Gono may be looking for a large one time 
<br>dividend by selling a share of the mine or the mining rights 
<br>to an outside investor. This would dwarf the relatively 
<br>small profits he is now accruing from the mine. 
<br>
<br>¶18. (C) ACR has offered the government a deal in which ACR 
<br>would take a 49 percent share of all diamond proceeds and 
<br>give the rest to the GOZ, but Cranswick did not seem 
<br>optimistic that the government would accept the deal. 
<br>
<br>----------------------------- 
<br>Two Other Major Diamond Mines 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶19. (U) Murowa is a well-regulated mine operated by the 
<br>British multinational mining giant Rio Tinto, which since 
<br>2004 has held a 78 percent share in the open-pit Murowa 
<br>diamond mine in Zvishavane district, in southern Masvingo 
<br>province. Murowa is a deep kimberlitic deposit that requires 
<br>heavy machinery to extract the soil and rock. 
<br>
<br>¶20. (U) River Ranch is partially owned by retired General 
<br>Solomon Mujuru (husband of Vice President Joyce Mujuru) and 
<br>is located in Beitbridge in Matabeleland South. Mujuru 
<br>gained a 20 percent stake in the mine at the expense of a 
<br>local company, Bubye Minerals, which was pushed out to 
<br>Mujuru's benefit. Bubye Minerals contested the ownership 
<br>change, but was thwarted by the Zimbabwean courts. It is 
<br>unclear if Mujuru purchased his stake. 
<br>
<br>------- 
<br>COMMENT 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶21. (C) In a country filled with corrupt schemes, the 
<br>diamond business in Zimbabwe is one of the dirtiest. Mining 
<br>in general remains the largest single source of foreign 
<br>exchange, but the potential of Chiadzwa is being lost to 
<br>Zimbabwean corruption. While Gono talks about using diamonds 
<br>to stabilize the Zimbabwean economy, he would only do so if 
<br>he thought he could personally make more in the process. At 
<br>present, police trying to bring order to Chiadzwa are 
<br>benefiting Zimbabwean officials who see the diamond field as 
<br>a new source of illegitimate income; the people of Zimbabwe 
<br>are seeing little return. 
<br>
<br>¶22. (C) It is also clear that Cranswick is a businessman 
<br>trying to find any pressure point he can through which to 
<br>leverage his own claim. At the same time, he sheds light on 
<br>
<br>HARARE 00001016 005 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>an industry that is enriching many of the same old corrupt 
<br>Zimbabwean elite--and causing violence and deaths that so far 
<br>have received little attention. END COMMENT.
