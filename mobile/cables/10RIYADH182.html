<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador James B. Smith for reasons 1.4 (B) and (D)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Ambassador Holbrooke, Embassy Riyadh warmly welcomes
<br>you to Saudi Arabia, which, by virtue of its historical and
<br>cultural ties to Central Asia; personal relationships between
<br>Saudi, Afghani and Pakistani leaders; financial power; and
<br>leadership of the Muslim world, can play a central role in
<br>implementing the President's strategy for Afghanistan and
<br>Pakistan. Your visit comes at a time of great potential but
<br>great uncertainty: the Saudi-Afghan relationship appears to
<br>be warming up, while the traditionally close Saudi-Pakistani
<br>relationship has grown increasingly strained. The Saudis are
<br>broadly supportive of our approach to Afghanistan and
<br>Pakistan, but occasionally express skepticism about our
<br>timing or our approach. Your visit provides an opportunity
<br>to mine the Saudis' wealth of experience in dealing with
<br>Afghanistan, Pakistan, and extremism, and further explore
<br>ways to translate our shared goals into action in the unique
<br>Saudi context. We have requested meetings with xxxxxxxxxxxx.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) SAUDI-AFGHAN RELATIONS WARMING: President Karzai's
<br>February 2-3 visit to the Kingdom, although richer in
<br>symbolism than substance, was a sign that lukewarm
<br>Saudi-Afghan relations may finally be warming up. In his
<br>official statement at the London Conference, FM Saud
<br>announced a $150 million pledge of additional financial
<br>support for Afghan reconstruction. He expressed broad Saudi
<br>support for reconciliation, adding that they would be willing
<br>to assist at the request of President Karzai-- on the
<br>condition that the Taliban sever its relationship with
<br>Al-Qaeda and cease providing refuge to its leaders. While
<br>not as forward leaning as we may have liked, FM Saud's
<br>statement put the Saudis on the record and created an
<br>opportunity to put reconciliation talks back in
<br>motion--eventually. Saudi participation at the Turkish-led
<br>regional conference on Afghanistan on January 26 was further
<br>evidence of the Saudi commitment to engagement. Karzai's
<br>visit showed that the King was ready to deal with Karzai as a
<br>legitimate, Muslim head of state. However, the Saudis
<br>continue to have concerns about Afghan corruption and believe
<br>greater political incorporation of the Pashtun community is
<br>essential. Their apparent wish to downplay Karzai's
<br>visit--as compared to the Afghans (reftel)--may also indicate
<br>the King's desire to keep some distance and maintain his
<br>credibility as a potential reconciliation mediator.
<br>
<br>¶3. (s/nf) but mediation not ready for prime time:
<br>Privately, the Saudis tell us it's still "too soon" to be
<br>publicly discussing technical and financial aspects of
<br>reintegration efforts. xxxxxxxxxxxx has made
<br>clear that his marching orders are to work through
<br>intelligence channels only until progress becomes
<br>sustainable, at which point foreign ministries will be
<br>brought in. In a recent meeting with the Ambassador, xxxxxxxxxxxx 
<br>hinted at but did not provide details about what
<br>appears to be significant movement on the Saudi mediation
<br>effort, with visits by high-level Taliban and Afghan
<br>officials, since the Hajj. We surmise that xxxxxxxxxxxx is
<br>reluctant to share information because the talks remain
<br>delicate and he fears U.S. involvement could derail progress.
<br>He has also voiced concern about how to address UNSCR 1267
<br>prohibitions on dealing with various Taliban members.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) ZARDARI STILL THE PROBLEM IN PAKISTAN: The Saudis
<br>generally agree that there is a need to deny terrorists
<br>safehavens in Pakistan, but question whether the methods we
<br>have outlined will be effective. Despite tense relations
<br>with the Zardari government, close military and intelligence
<br>cooperation continues between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The
<br>Saudis believe opposition leader Nawaz Sharif can play a
<br>"great role" in working with tribal chiefs and that "money is
<br>better than bullets" in the fight against the Taliban. They
<br>have started to fulfill their pledge from the Tokyo donor,s
<br>conference (over half of the $700 million pledged has been
<br>disbursed) and have expressed a willingness to continue with
<br>financial support for a stable Pakistan. Saudi interlocutors
<br>stress the importance of remembering that Pakistan remains
<br>
<br>Riyadh 00000182 002.2 of 003
<br>
<br>
<br>pre-occupied with issues on its Indian border, coloring its
<br>ability to deal with the Taliban.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) IN THE ARMY WE TRUST: The tumultuous democratic
<br>process in Pakistan makes the Saudis nervous, and they appear
<br>to be looking for "another Musharraf": a strong, forceful
<br>leader they know they can trust. In his January meeting with
<br>General Jones, the King cited President Zardari as an
<br>impediment to denying terrorist safehavens, calling him an
<br>"obstacle" and "a rotten head" that was infecting the whole
<br>body. He maintained that the Pakistani Army was capable of
<br>being a strong partner for the U.S., and opined that U.S.
<br>development assistance would rebuild trust. He asserted that
<br>that the Army was staying out of Pakistani politics in
<br>deference to U.S. wishes, rather than doing what it "should."
<br>FM Saud told General Jones that we must reach out to tribal
<br>leaders and separate "those we could work with" from "those
<br>we must fight." He believed that using the military to fight
<br>extremists posed certain dangers, and that the credibility of
<br>the army must be maintained. The Saudis were pushing
<br>Pakistan's civilian leaders to work together, but "compromise
<br>seemed alien to Pakistani politicians."
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) TURKI'S TAKE: During a recent meeting with
<br>Ambassador, former GIP Director Prince Turki Al-Faisal called
<br>Afghanistan a "puzzle," where establishing trust with Afghan
<br>leaders, and recognizing the links between Pakistan and the
<br>Taliban, were keys to success. All financial aid to the
<br>Afghan government should be conditional: benchmarks must be
<br>set for the leadership, and aid must be withheld until these
<br>are met. Recent Saudi efforts to assist in Taliban mediation
<br>had failed, he said, when "both sides fell short." He
<br>described the Taliban leadership as "fractured," and
<br>suggested the U.S. and NATO needed to target criminal
<br>elements more vociferously and re-focus our attention on
<br>capturing Osama Bin Laden and Ayman Al-Zawahiri. He
<br>suggested Saudi Arabia, the U.S., China, Russia, Afghanistan
<br>and Pakistan could join forces and share assets in order to
<br>capture or kill bin Laden and Al-Zawahiri. This would break
<br>the terrorists' "aura of invincibility" and allow the U.S. to
<br>"declare victory" and move on.
<br>
<br>¶7. (S/NF) TERRORISM FINANCE: Terrorist funding emanating
<br>from Saudi Arabia remains a serious concern. Over the last
<br>year, however, Saudi Arabia has made important progress in
<br>combating al-Qaida financing emanating from the country.
<br>Sensitive reporting indicates that al-Qaida's ability to
<br>raise funds has deteriorated substantially, and that it is
<br>now in its weakest state since 9/11. The Kingdom is also
<br>cooperating more actively than at any previous point to
<br>respond to terrorist financing concerns raised by the United
<br>States, and to investigate and detain financial facilitators
<br>of concern. Nonetheless, sustained engagement is required to
<br>maintain the current momentum, particularly in providing the
<br>Saudis with specific details and actionable information.
<br>Your visit provides another opportunity to welcome the
<br>progress Saudi Arabia has made, and reiterate the importance
<br>that President Obama and the USG place on curtailing
<br>fundraising activity by global terrorist groups in Saudi
<br>Arabia, particularly those that undermine the stability of
<br>Afghanistan and Pakistan.
<br>
<br>¶8. (S/NF) TERRORISM FINANCE, CONTINUED: While in the past
<br>the KSA stood reluctant to pursue Saudi donors who backed
<br>groups that did not directly threaten the Kingdom, the Saudi
<br>Ministry of Interior (MOI) has now demonstrated willingness
<br>to take action, and has begun to detain individuals involved
<br>in funding networks for groups such as Lashkar e-Tayyiba
<br>(LeT), the Taliban, and in some cases even Hamas. Our TF
<br>cooperation with the MOI is of utmost strategic importance to
<br>U.S. national security as donors in Saudi Arabia continue to
<br>constitute a source of funding to Sunni extremist groups
<br>worldwide. Available intelligence reflects that the Kingdom
<br>remains an important fundraising locale-especially during the
<br>Hajj and Ramadan-for the Taliban, LeT, and other terrorist
<br>groups based in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The MOI remains
<br>almost completely dependent on the CIA to provide analytic
<br>support and direction for its counterterrorism operations. As
<br>such, our success against terrorist financing in the Kingdom
<br>remains directly tied to our ability to provide actionable
<br>intelligence to our Saudi counterparts. In order to enhance
<br>the USG's ability to influence and direct Saudi efforts to
<br>
<br>Riyadh 00000182 003.2 of 003
<br>
<br>
<br>disrupt terrorist financing, in 2008 we stood up a Treasury
<br>attach office in Embassy Riyadh. This office actively
<br>contributes to the daily intelligence sharing process that
<br>is led by CIA.
<br>
<br>¶9. (S/NF) TERRORISM FINANCE, CONTINUED: Saudi Arabia has
<br>taken increasingly aggressive efforts to disrupt al-Qaida's
<br>access to funding from Saudi sources. An example of recent
<br>progress by the KSA is the conviction of over 300 people for
<br>involvement in terrorism, including some for providing
<br>financial support. News reports suggest that appeals may be
<br>opened to the media in order to enhance the deterrent effects
<br>of such prosecutions. In addition, Assistant Interior
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx stated that
<br>the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) deliberately timed its
<br>August 19, 2009 press release regarding the arrest of 44
<br>terrorist supporters to deter potential donors from giving
<br>money to suspected terrorist groups during Ramadan. Although
<br>a great deal of work remains to be done,xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>has given his commitment to work with the United States on
<br>Taliban finance, and has said that the MOI will arrest
<br>individuals involved in Saudi-based Taliban fundraising
<br>activities - even if involved in the reconciliation process -
<br>when provided with actionable intelligence.
<br>
<br>¶10. (S/NF) IDENTIFYING OPPORTUNITIES: The Saudis have
<br>expressed broad support for the President's strategy on
<br>Afghanistan and Pakistan, but often balk when asked to
<br>designate an SRAP to coordinate policy with the USG and
<br>others. In part, this reflects the centralized Saudi
<br>decision-making process and the reality that issues related
<br>to Afghanistan and Pakistan policy are not delegated, but
<br>rather dealt with directly by the King and members of the
<br>intelligence community. While the Saudis are hesitant to
<br>delegate authority and tend to make only broad-based
<br>commitments to high-profile, multilateral initiatives, they
<br>appear ready, willing and eager to share their experiences
<br>with us and identify greater opportunities for cooperation on
<br>a bilateral basis. Your visit provides an opportunity to
<br>further explore how we can best translate our shared goals
<br>into action in the unique Saudi context.
