<br>
<br>Summary
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) On the same week as the successful U.S.-Russia
<br>Presidential Summit in Moscow, the United States and Russia
<br>held their sixth Experts Meeting under their bilateral
<br>Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) Arrangement July
<br>9-10 in Washington. Several items of interest were covered,
<br>including: 1. a framework for the exchange of information on
<br>domestic MANPADS destruction; 2. the risk of diversion of
<br>MANPADS from Venezuela to the FARC; 3. illicit MANPADS
<br>proliferation from Eritrea; 4. potential cooperation on
<br>MANPADS destruction projects with other states; and 5. next
<br>steps to facilitate the transfer of Russian-made Finnish
<br>MANPADS to the U.S. for countermeasures testing. The Russian
<br>side again requested U.S. help preventing the spread of
<br>MANPADS in the Caucasus, in particular information on
<br>Polish-supplied MANPADS to Georgia that were discovered in
<br>Chechnya following the August 2008 conflict. In response to
<br>our non-paper on the subject, the Russian MFA informed us it
<br>had begun a dialogue with the Polish government. The next
<br>Experts Meeting was tentatively scheduled for fall 2010 in
<br>Moscow, at the earliest. The U.S. delegation was co-chaired
<br>by Steven Costner (Deputy Director of PM/WRA) and Anita
<br>Friedt (Director of EUR/PRA). The Russian delegation was
<br>chaired by Col. Oleg Skabara from the MOD. See para 31 for a
<br>full delegation list. End Summary.
<br>
<br>Information Exchanges
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) Both sides provided the details of their quarterly
<br>MANPADS transfers. The U.S. submitted its first quarter
<br>report, which reported no transfers from January 1-March 31,
<br>prior to the meeting. The U.S. provided its second quarter
<br>report (due by September 30), which covered April 1 through
<br>June 30, during the meeting, which also reported no
<br>transfers. The Russians provided their first quarter
<br>exchange prior to the meeting, which reported the transfer of
<br>100 IGLA-S missiles and 90 associated gripstocks to
<br>Venezuela. (see below para for more details on the Venezuela
<br>discussion).
<br>
<br>Destruction Information Exchange
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) The U.S. side raised the issue of the exchange of
<br>information on the destruction of obsolete MANPADS,
<br>referencing the U.S. non-paper which detailed our proposal
<br>for the exchange that was provided to the GOR in advance of
<br>the meeting. The Russian delegation acknowledged receiving
<br>the U.S. non-paper and expressed gratitude for starting a
<br>dialogue on this topic. The sides agreed in principle that
<br>the exchange should take place on an annual basis, that both
<br>sides would consider reporting information starting with
<br>2005, and that information on the quantity and type of
<br>missiles and gripstocks destroyed should be included. The
<br>sides also agreed that the quantities - but not types - of
<br>batteries should be reported in this exchange.
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) The Russian delegation expressed a willingness to
<br>discuss the issue further, but insisted that they needed more
<br>time to clear the U.S. proposal with other executive agencies
<br>within the Russian government. The Russians recognized the
<br>U.S. has taken serious steps on this issue and suggested that
<br>the sides continue this dialogue through diplomatic channels.
<br>
<br>
<br>Venezuela MANPADS transfers
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) In response to the U.S. paper outlining U.S. concerns
<br>about the possibility of diversion to non state actors of
<br>IGLA-S systems being delivered to the Government of Venezuela
<br>(GOV), the Russian delegation stated that they understood the
<br>concerns raised at high levels between our Secretary of State
<br>and the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs as well as
<br>between Russian Ambassador Kislyak and WHA A/S Shannon.
<br>Skabara assured the U.S. delegation that Russian law provides
<br>specific measures to prevent illegal transfers to third
<br>parties. He then stated that the issues raised in the paper
<br>were reflected in end user checks as well as in the contract
<br>between the GOR and GOV, and that the GOR has required an
<br>end-user regime that guarantees that transfers to third
<br>parties will not take place. Skabara said that the U.S.
<br>delegation had seen how well the Russians secure their
<br>stockpiles and assured the U.S. that these same controls were
<br>written into the contract with Venezuela. Along with this,
<br>the GOR has had dialogue with the GOV evaluating the GOV's
<br>physical security of the systems, which specifically featured
<br>a discussion about the FARC. GOR assured the U.S. side that
<br>transfers from Venezuela to the FARC cannot take place.
<br>
<br>¶6. (S) Questions and comparisons were raised by the U.S.
<br>side about Russian ammunition, sold to Venezuela, and found
<br>in possession of the FARC. Skabara first suggested that the
<br>ammunition did not come from Russia, but was probably a sale
<br>from "unlicensed production" a suggestion that it was
<br>manufactured in a third country without appropriate permits
<br>from Russia. When the U.S. side pointed out that the
<br>ammunition carried factory stamps, and that we provided this
<br>information, the Russians responded that the meeting was to
<br>discuss MANPADS, not ammunition, and that these are different
<br>weapons and the approach, scale, and control applied to them
<br>are different. He said the U.S. did not provide enough
<br>information to the Russians on the confiscated ammunition for
<br>them to fully investigate the discovery; however Russia is
<br>carrying out an investigation. He added that it would be
<br>"impossible" for a similar scenario to take place with
<br>MANPADS, as they have an ongoing dialogue with Venezuela that
<br>allows them to evaluate the security and use of these
<br>MANPADS, and thus none of these MANPADS can be transferred to
<br>the FARC.
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) Giovanni Snidle from WHA/FO said that he was pleased
<br>to be able to report to Ambassador Shannon that an
<br>investigation is ongoing into the Russian cartridges found
<br>with the FARC and that the U.S. would appreciate if the
<br>Russians shared the findings. Snidle expressed that the
<br>concerns were not Venezuela-specific, but a concern with the
<br>Western Hemisphere as a whole, noting that when new MANPADS
<br>were provided to the Venezuelans, it was possible that the
<br>older, excess MANPADS could be transferred to others in the
<br>region. He asked the Russians to consider the following
<br>parameters (also outlined in a non-paper provided in advance
<br>of the meeting) when signing MANPADS contracts with western
<br>hemisphere countries:
<br>
<br>--Vehicle-mounted variants as opposed to shoulder-fired.
<br>--Limited numbers.
<br>--One-for-one replacement of old/outdated MANPADS.
<br>--Destruction of old stockpiles.
<br>
<br>He stated that he was pleased to hear of the level of
<br>accountability and encouraged them to continue end-use
<br>assurances in future transfers.
<br>
<br>The Russians noted that Venezuela didn't want vehicle mounted
<br>systems, it only requested shoulder-fired systems, and that
<br>the two systems are not interchangeable. Skabara agreed to
<br>take the suggestions on one-for-one replacement and stockpile
<br>destruction back to Moscow for consideration.
<br>
<br>¶8. (S) ISN's Ann Ganzer asked about the "surprise
<br>inspections," mentioned to Secretary Clinton by Minister
<br>Lavrov. Skabara stated that these were not exactly surprise
<br>inspections. He explained that an inspection would be
<br>triggered if the GOR believed the contract had been violated
<br>or had information that indicated an inspection was
<br>necessary. (Comment: This is consistent with what the
<br>Russians have told us in previous MANPADS meetings. End
<br>Comment) He added that, to date, no inspections have been
<br>conducted and that no future inspections are scheduled. He
<br>did not consider the ammunition transferred to the FARC to be
<br>an indication that an inspection was warranted, as ammunition
<br>is not the same as MANPADS. He assured the U.S. side that
<br>the contract endowed the GOR with the right to perform a
<br>spontaneous inspection at any time. Costner noted that, if
<br>fully implemented, the surprise inspections would lessen the
<br>likelihood of a diversion and urged the GOR to perform these
<br>inspections regardless of the presence of a "triggering
<br>event."
<br>
<br>¶9. (S) Skabara was receptive to U.S. inquiries on the
<br>exchange and its end-user controls and stated that if
<br>provided with specific questions, through diplomatic
<br>channels, they will be able to respond. The U.S. pointed out
<br>that it had already provided detailed questions in the
<br>non-paper, passed to the GOR in advance of the meeting, and
<br>that a written response to these inquiries would be
<br>appreciated. Skabara said that there had not been enough
<br>time to prepare a response to the paper, but that the answers
<br>could be provided in written form once they get back to
<br>Moscow. He sought a U.S. briefing on end-user controls in
<br>response. Skabara said that every state has a right to self
<br>defense under the United Nations Charter; however, the GOR is
<br>aware of the strategic, practical, and technical norms. He
<br>added that there is a line that should not be crossed, but
<br>that the MANPADS provided to Venezuela would not destabilize
<br>the region. He finished by stating that he could not get into
<br>details about any future shipments and highlighted that
<br>Russia is willing to engage in an open dialogue on this
<br>issue.
<br>
<br>Horn Of Africa/Eritrea
<br>
<br>¶10. (S) The U.S. delegation then raised the issue of
<br>Russian-made Eritrean MANPADS discovered in Somalia which was
<br>discussed at the Experts Meeting in 2008 (ref F). The
<br>Russian delegation confirmed that the MFA raised this issue
<br>with the Government of Eritrea (GOE), and had not revealed
<br>the U.S. as the source of the allegation. According to the
<br>Russian MFA representative the GOE denied that the transfer
<br>took place, accusing "enemies," namely Ethiopia, of
<br>fabricating the accusation. The GOE demanded further
<br>information on the transfer including the source and other
<br>supporting information (i.e. photographs). The U.S.
<br>delegation offered to discuss the question of photographs
<br>with relevant U.S. agencies and report back to the GOR
<br>through diplomatic channels. The Russian side then stated
<br>that its relationship with Eritrea is not strong, thus Russia
<br>cannot guarantee any further useful information on this
<br>issue.
<br>
<br>¶11. (S) The U.S. delegation then reiterated a request from
<br>the 2008 Meeting for a detailed list of all Soviet and
<br>Russian MANPADS transfers to Eritrea and the HOA in general.
<br>The Russian delegation responded that this was impossible, as
<br>all records of MANPADS transfers prior to the year 2000 were
<br>destroyed in accordance with Russian laws governing
<br>classified information. Further questioning by the U.S.
<br>delegation on this issue raised a series of translation
<br>problems. The Russian side did not understand requests from
<br>the U.S. delegation for "records" of these transfers. The
<br>Russian delegation stated that records of MANPADS transfers
<br>(but not serial numbers) after 2000 (possibly from 2003) may
<br>be available and offered to investigate the issue and report
<br>back via diplomatic channels. The Russians asked for a
<br>formal, written request on this issue. (Comment:
<br>Misunderstandings related to translation errors during this
<br>discussion may warrant a follow up with the GOR to confirm
<br>Skabara's statements. End Comment.)
<br>
<br>Georgia
<br>
<br>¶12. (S) The Russian delegation then raised the question of
<br>Georgian MANPADS proliferation. Skabara first outlined the
<br>GOR's concerns about the build-up of weapons in Georgia and
<br>potential "Georgian aggression" in the Caucasus. Skabara
<br>continued by invoking Section 5 of the Bilateral Arrangement
<br>where Russia and the U.S. are bound to the obligation of
<br>preventing the transfer of Polish MANPADS to Georgia. The
<br>Russian delegation acknowledged receipt of our non-paper in
<br>response to Russia's concerns and confirmed that the Russian
<br>MFA had begun a dialogue with the Polish government on this
<br>issue.
<br>
<br>¶13. (S) Costner acknowledged the mutual interests the U.S.
<br>and Russian sides have, and the connection that exists
<br>between stemming MANPADS proliferation in Venezuela/Horn of
<br>Africa and the Caucasus, respectively. He noted the U.S. has
<br>raised concerns with the Georgian government on stockpile
<br>security and controls of excess munitions. He emphasized
<br>that the key difference lies in the fact that the U.S. has
<br>never transferred MANPADS to Georgia.
<br>
<br>¶14. (S) Following Costner's remarks, EUR/PRA Office Director
<br>Anita Friedt added that the U.S. deeply regrets the loss of
<br>life on both the Georgian and Russian sides resulting from
<br>the August conflict. She underscored that the U.S. has not
<br>transferred MANPADS systems to Georgia and affirmed the USG
<br>policy of non-lethal weapon assistance to Georgia. She said
<br>the U.S. and Georgia had a strong nonproliferation
<br>partnership and expressed appreciation for Russian efforts to
<br>reach out to Poland on this issue. The Russian delegation
<br>reiterated its concerns on this issue, the importance of not
<br>blaming each other by continuing this dialogue, and requested
<br>that the U.S continue to work with both Georgia and Poland.
<br>
<br>¶15. (S) Skabara thanked the U.S. side for working with
<br>Poland and Georgia on this issue and stated that the GOR has
<br>had a pragmatic and active dialogue with Poland and hopes
<br>that in the future this dialogue will generate specific
<br>results on this question. Russia would continue to share
<br>the outcome of this dialogue with the U.S. in the future.
<br>
<br>Black Markets in Latin America
<br>
<br>¶16. (S/NF) The U.S. side then gave a briefing on the MANPADS
<br>black market in Latin America. The MANPADS black market in
<br>the region is small, the number of potential users is low,
<br>and prices are high compared to other regions such as the
<br>Middle East, South Asia, and Africa. Central American
<br>countries historically have posed the largest proliferation
<br>risk because of the availability of systems unrecovered after
<br>civil conflicts in the 1980s. The U.S. side stated concerns
<br>about the FARC's apparent desire to obtain MANPADS, but said
<br>that the likelihood that they have already is very low.
<br>Specific instances where there would be heightened risk of
<br>proliferation could include when MANPADS are deployed to
<br>forward operating bases (as in the case of Venezuela).
<br>MANPADS are generally secure when they are in central
<br>stockpiles; however, when they are deployed they may be lost
<br>in combat, corruption, or to the black market. The U.S. side
<br>reiterated that any proliferation to the FARC is important
<br>and is likely to lead to a significant increase in the air
<br>defense threat to Colombian and US aircraft operating in the
<br>region.
<br>
<br>¶17. (S/NF) The U.S. briefing laid out possible steps to
<br>limiting illicit proliferation of MANPADS, including:
<br>inventory of existing stockpiles, avoidance of
<br>destabilizing-sized sales, destruction of old stockpiles, and
<br>limitations to the portability of systems. This complemented
<br>directly the U.S. requests for curbing the threat posed by
<br>sales to Venezuela, including offering vehicle- or pedestal-
<br>mounted variants rather than shoulder-fired systems.
<br>
<br>¶18. (S/REL RUSSIA) The Russian side responded positively to
<br>the brief and asked if the U.S. exports MANPADS to South
<br>America. The U.S. side responded that the U.S. exports very
<br>few MANPADS anywhere and since at least 2005 (i.e., when the
<br>Arrangement was signed and quarterly transfer exchanges
<br>began) there has not been a single MANPADS transferred to
<br>South America. There are no STINGER MANPADS in South America
<br>and that obsolete, U.S. REDEYE MANPADS would have been pulled
<br>out years ago.
<br>
<br>Regional Cooperation Efforts
<br>
<br>¶19. (S) Snidle then gave a brief presentation on U.S.
<br>efforts with the OAS to provide for the security of MANPADS
<br>in Latin America. Snidle explained that the International
<br>Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) had urged the region in
<br>2004 to take concrete steps to protect themselves against
<br>MANPADS threats. The OAS states have since signed Resolution
<br>2145 which urged them to adopt strict national MANPADS
<br>controls, ban transfers to non-state actors, destroy excess
<br>and unsecured weapons, and recommended physical security and
<br>stockpile management guidelines. The OAS produced a set of
<br>MANPADS regulations, originally written in four languages, to
<br>adhere to the resolution. Snidle urged the Russians to
<br>adhere to these guidelines when selling/transferring MANPADS
<br>to the region.
<br>
<br>¶20. (S) For the final item of the first day, the Russian
<br>delegation responded by outlining its cooperation with CIS
<br>member states. According to the Russian delegation, the GOR
<br>has recently concluded frameworks for information exchange on
<br>MANPADS stockpile security measures in Uzbekistan and
<br>Ukraine, and is working to establish similar agreements in
<br>Moldova and Azerbaijan. The agreement with the Uzbeks has
<br>entered into force; the agreement with the Ukrainians was
<br>signed in May 2009 and is expected to enter into force this
<br>year. The GOR sought a similar arrangement with Georgia, but
<br>has not received a Georgian reply on this question since
<br>April 2008.
<br>
<br>¶21. (SBU) On the second day of talks, Louis Ganem from
<br>ISN/CATR briefed on regional security seminars hosted by the
<br>U.S. for several regional partners. He provided information
<br>on how the United States coordinates and implements
<br>multinational conferences and seminars on small arms and
<br>light weapons, with a focus on MANPADS proliferation. Ganem
<br>explained that the seminars are designed to identify regional
<br>threats, common security goals, exchange information on
<br>security programs and training, identify requirements, and
<br>provide program assistance. He added that regional partners,
<br>sharing the same security goals, are invited to discuss how
<br>to improve existing and implement new regional security
<br>capabilities. The focus of such seminars is on identifying
<br>preventive security measures, such as export controls and
<br>border security programs and training to eliminate the risks
<br>of illicit proliferation. The intent is to improve regional
<br>security capabilities by promoting partnership and
<br>cooperation among partner nations. Ganem concluded
<br>contemplating the possibility of future events in South and
<br>Central Asia and Latin America, and asked the Russians to
<br>consider participation.
<br>
<br>¶22. (S) The Russian delegation responded to this
<br>presentation positively, stating that they had sent
<br>representatives, including Col. Kuts, to similar multilateral
<br>seminars in the CIS region. The Russians also agreed in
<br>principle that the U.S. and the GOR could potentially
<br>collaborate on future regional seminars. Skabara invited the
<br>U.S. to send proposals for future MANPADS seminars or similar
<br>events to the GOR for consideration.
<br>
<br>Destruction Cooperation
<br>
<br>¶23. (S) Costner then provided an update about U.S.
<br>destruction cooperation efforts with other states. Since
<br>2003, the U.S. has helped destroy over 30,000 MANPADS
<br>missiles in 27 states, with approximately 4,000 destroyed
<br>since the last update provided at the 2008 meeting. The
<br>Russian delegation praised these efforts, and proposed that
<br>the U.S. and Russia collaborate on joint destruction projects
<br>in the future under the auspices of the Arrangement. The
<br>U.S. agreed that such efforts would be worthwhile, and
<br>expressed a willingness to look for opportunities for
<br>collaboration.
<br>
<br>FINNPADS
<br>
<br>¶24. (S) The U.S. delegation then followed-up with the
<br>Russian delegation about the transfer of Russian-made Finnish
<br>MANPADS to the U.S. for countermeasures testing. The Russian
<br>delegation stated that the GOR would agree to the transfer
<br>under two conditions: 1. that Russian experts be present for
<br>the tests, and 2. that the results of the tests be shared in
<br>writing with the GOR. This offer, and its decision to allow
<br>the transfer, had not yet been presented to the Finnish
<br>Government, as it represents a change in Russian policy on
<br>this question. Skabara highlighted the fact that the "new
<br>relationship" between the U.S. and Russia had inspired this
<br>change in policy. The Russian delegation was unable to
<br>provide further detail about the specifics of this proposal,
<br>such as how many Russian visits would be required or how
<br>thorough the report to the GOR would need to be. The U.S.
<br>requested that the GOR formally submit its decision,
<br>including its two conditions in writing. Both sides agreed
<br>to discuss further the details of the conditions and then
<br>inform the Finnish Government about the decision. (Comment:
<br>The Finns have almost 2,000 SA-16s and SA-18s to dispose of
<br>because of shelf life issues. This dialogue has been going
<br>on sporadically for almost two years; the first Russian
<br>response cited almost the same conditions as Skabara
<br>presented on July 10. End Comment.)
<br>
<br>VERBA MANPADS
<br>
<br>¶25. (S) The U.S. side provided the Russians with an
<br>open-source (2007) article that described a new Russian
<br>MANPADS system called the VERBA. Costner read key passages
<br>in the article to the Russian side, pointing out that the
<br>article suggests the VERBA would enter into service in 2008.
<br>The article also states that the VERBA will replace the
<br>STRELA and IGLA family of systems and have a payload twenty
<br>percent larger than either of its predecessors. Costner
<br>asked the Russian delegation to provide additional
<br>information on the VERBA, including if it was operational,
<br>and if it would be marketed.
<br>
<br>¶26. (S) The Russian side responded that they had no further
<br>information. Skabara questioned the legitimacy of the
<br>article saying that scientists can "write whatever they want"
<br>and stated that there was no official position on the system.
<br>Skabara stated that if the U.S. wanted more information on
<br>this system, it would have to forward a written request
<br>through diplomatic channels with its questions. The U.S.
<br>agreed to do this.
<br>
<br>Legislative updates
<br>
<br>¶27. (S) Neither side had anything to report. Skabara
<br>stated that the GOR is on track to implement all of its legal
<br>mechanisms and before it develops new ones, wants to make
<br>sure they implement those they have.
<br>
<br>Conclusion
<br>
<br>¶28. (S) Costner summarized the meeting and noted the
<br>following action items and "due-outs" by both sides ahead of
<br>the next meeting:
<br>
<br>U.S. side:
<br>
<br>¶1. On Eritrea/Somalia, the U.S. will seek authorization to
<br>release photographic evidence of Russian MANPADS diversion to
<br>Somalia for the purpose of Russia following up with the
<br>Eritrean government.
<br>¶2. On Finland, the U.S. will respond to Russia's
<br>conditions on participating in MANPADS destruction and
<br>countermeasure testing.
<br>¶3. The U.S. will follow up on the open source article
<br>handed over and produce an official request for information
<br>regarding the VERBA MANPADS system.
<br>
<br>Russian side:
<br>¶1. Official comments regarding U.S. proposal in the
<br>non-paper passed regarding exchange of destruction
<br>information, in particular our clarification on quantity and
<br>types of items to be reported.
<br>¶2. On Venezuela, the Russian side promised to provide a
<br>written response to questions and recommendations made in our
<br>non-paper handed over prior to the meeting.
<br>¶3. On VERBA MANPADS, written response to our official
<br>request for additional information, once it is received by
<br>the Russian side.
<br>¶4. The Russian side will detail in writing its conditions,
<br>as described by the MFA during the meeting, regarding
<br>authorization for Finland to transfer Russian-origin MANPADS
<br>to the U.S. for countermeasure testing.
<br>¶5. The transfer notice by the end of September covering
<br>the time period of April through June.
<br>
<br>Both sides:
<br>¶1. The U.S. side will look into the possibility of having
<br>both sides brief each other on the conduct of our respective
<br>inspection regimes (derived from our discussion on Venezuela).
<br>¶2. The delegations agreed that more work and dialogue
<br>needs to take place between the annual meetings and proposed
<br>a date of September 30, 2009 as a target date for having the
<br>due outs complete.
<br>¶3. Propose dates for the next MANPADS Experts meeting,
<br>possibly to be held in Moscow in the fall of 2010.
<br>
<br>The Russian side did not have anything to add regarding these
<br>due-outs. Skabara promised the Russian side would look into
<br>the matter of diverted ammunition to the FARC. He then
<br>requested that the U.S. provide pictures and cartridges found
<br>for technical analysis.
<br>
<br>Comment:
<br>
<br>¶29. (S/NF) Both sides agreed the July 9-10 meeting was a
<br>success; the tone of the meeting was more positive than in
<br>previous years, consistent with the "reset" of U.S.-Russia
<br>relations. Two potentially unsettling differences from years
<br>past was the reduced size of the Russian delegation (only 2
<br>from MOD, 1 from MFA) and a desire on the Russian side to
<br>extend the time before the next meeting to eighteen months or
<br>even two years. Both sides have settled on the routine and
<br>relatively less controversial elements of the Arrangement
<br>(such as information exchanges), but challenges remain on
<br>transparency over the more controversial issues we discussed,
<br>such as on Venezuela.
<br>
<br>¶30. (S/NF) Comment continued: Both sides recognized the
<br>utility of holding a continuous dialogue on MANPADS issues
<br>through diplomatic channels and along the sidelines of other
<br>SA/LW meetings, such as the UN Biennial Meetings of States on
<br>SA/LW in New York in June of 2010. The Counter Terrorism
<br>Working Group (CTWG) would also present another opportunity
<br>for follow-up. Additionally, both sides indicated a
<br>willingness to deepen cooperation on MANPADS issues to
<br>include potential joint destruction programs, regional
<br>seminars, and other bilateral efforts. These more robust
<br>programs would likely increase the utility of the
<br>Arrangement, as the sides broaden their MANPADS cooperation
<br>beyond the scope of info exchanges and an annual meeting.
<br>Yet, as Costner summed up in response to the Russian proposal
<br>to hold these meetings less frequently, it is much harder to
<br>play a game of chess by mail than in person. End comment.
