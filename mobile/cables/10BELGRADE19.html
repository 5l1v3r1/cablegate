<br>SUBJECT: Serbia: Ambassador's First Meeting with President Tadic 
<br>
<br>CLASSIFIED BY: Mary Warlick, Ambassador, State, EXEC; REASON: 1.4(B), 
<br>(D) 
<br>
<br>Summary 
<br>
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) In a January 28 meeting with Serbian President Tadic, the 
<br>Ambassador emphasized her desire to expand bilateral cooperation on 
<br>defense and economic issues, as well as to increase high-level 
<br>contacts between our governments. Tadic welcomed the intent but 
<br>expressed frustration that he had not been able to visit Washington 
<br>for over four years. Echoing comments made in his public remarks 
<br>during the Ambassador's credentialing ceremony (para. 12), Tadic 
<br>warned that U.S. policy toward Kosovo threatened democracy in 
<br>Serbia by strengthening the nationalist opposition. The Ambassador 
<br>reiterated U.S. support for Serbia's EU aspirations and urged 
<br>continued strong cooperation with the ICTY. Tadic expressed 
<br>appreciation for U.S. support on EU integration and explained that 
<br>Serbia was pursuing the remaining ICTY indictees because it was in 
<br>its own interest to do so. Similarly, as a Dayton guarantor Serbia 
<br>would continue to support the territorial integrity of 
<br>Bosnia-Herzegovina, Tadic said. He told the Ambassador that he 
<br>would work with Croatian President-elect Josipovic, an old 
<br>acquaintance, to address the many difficult issues dividing Serbia 
<br>and Croatia. On Kosovo, Tadic emphatically stated that Serbia 
<br>would not change its position on its own territorial integrity. He 
<br>expressed the desire to pursue a dialogue after the International 
<br>Court of Justice renders its advisory opinion, as the current 
<br>situation was untenable. The Ambassador responded that the 
<br>dialogue should begin now in order to find the best way to manage 
<br>reaction to the ICJ's opinion and move forward on the many pressing 
<br>issues related to Kosovo. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) After presenting her credentials on January 28, the 
<br>Ambassador had a 45 minute working meeting with President Boris 
<br>Tadic. Tadic was accompanied by his foreign policy advisor Jovan 
<br>Ratkovic and MFA State Secretary Mirko Stefanovic. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Bilateral 
<br>
<br>--------- 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) The Ambassador told Tadic that she was eager to work with 
<br>him to build on the strong foundation created by her predecessors, 
<br>noting that Vice President Biden's May 2009 visit to Belgrade had 
<br>opened a new chapter in our bilateral relations. She said that the 
<br>military-to-military relationship was strong, but it was time to 
<br>take it to the next level through increased joint training and 
<br>exchanges, Serbian contributions to peacekeeping missions, and 
<br>participation in NATO Partnership for Peace (PfP) activities. The 
<br>Ambassador also told Tadic that she would focus on expanding 
<br>economic and business ties, including new investments, and 
<br>supporting the completion of Serbia's WTO accession. She also 
<br>emphasized her commitment to seek opportunities for additional 
<br>high-level contacts between our governments. She noted President 
<br>Tadic's visit to UNGA last fall, the recent visits of Defense 
<br>Minister Sutanovac and Foreign Minister Jeremic to Washington, and 
<br>Interior Minister Dacic's meetings this week. The Ambassador 
<br>pointed to two upcoming congressional delegations to Serbia and the 
<br>February 10 groundbreaking for the New Embassy Compound (NEC) in 
<br>Belgrade as early opportunities to continue our engagement and 
<br>further highlight the relationship publicly. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Tadic said he was pleasantly surprised to hear about the 
<br>scheduled groundbreaking event, as he had worked with four 
<br>different U.S. ambassadors going back to his tenure as Minister of 
<br>Defense to identify a suitable location for the new U.S. Embassy 
<br>
<br>BELGRADE 00000019 002 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>and facilitate the sale. He commented that he was encouraged to 
<br>see countries such as the U.S. and China investing in modern 
<br>diplomatic facilities in Belgrade. He also stated that it was time 
<br>for the Serbian government to reconstruct its own buildings damaged 
<br>during the 1999 NATO intervention. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Shifting topics abruptly, Tadic voiced a complaint that 
<br>despite all the talk of expanding the bilateral relations and the 
<br>strong ties between Serbia and the U.S., he himself had not visited 
<br>Washington in over four years. (Note: To our knowledge this is 
<br>the first time that Tadic has expressed an interest in doing so in 
<br>several years.) He commented that concrete results of high-level 
<br>engagement were lacking, and cautioned that U.S. policy toward the 
<br>Balkans, in particular on Kosovo, had implications for democracy in 
<br>Serbia. Recalling his own early involvement in the democracy 
<br>movement and the month he had spent in jail for his activism, Tadic 
<br>said that his government was committed to continued democratic 
<br>reform; it had to contend with a significant nationalist 
<br>opposition, however. The Ambassador reiterated the USG's 
<br>commitment, following on the Vice President's May 2009 visit, to 
<br>sustained bilateral engagement with Serbia on all issues, including 
<br>those areas where we do not agree. She offered to continue to 
<br>explore possibilities for high-level visits on both sides to keep 
<br>our bilateral channels open. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>European Integration and ICTY Cooperation 
<br>
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) The Ambassador recalled Vice President Biden's expression 
<br>of support for Serbia's European aspirations and congratulated 
<br>Tadic on his government's recent achievements with the EU, 
<br>including visa liberalization, implementation of the Interim Trade 
<br>Agreement, and submission of its membership application. The U.S. 
<br>saw the integration of the Western Balkans into the European Union 
<br>as a key priority and remained prepared, working with the EU, to 
<br>support this process. She underscored the importance of continued 
<br>engagement with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former 
<br>Yugoslavia (ICTY) and U.S. readiness to support the hunt for Ratko 
<br>Mladic and Goran Hadzic. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) Tadic expressed appreciation for U.S. help with the EU 
<br>accession process. On ICTY cooperation, he explained that Serbia 
<br>was working intensively to capture Ratko Mladic "for our own 
<br>reasons," not due to pressure from the international community or 
<br>the ICTY, but to demonstrate its own resolve to capture war 
<br>criminals. He emphasized Serbia's commitment to reconciliation in 
<br>the region, pointing to its responsibilities as a guarantor of 
<br>Dayton. He also underscored Serbia's commitment to cooperation 
<br>with the U.S. on a range of threats, including organized crime, 
<br>corruption, terrorism, and narcotics, pointing to the success of 
<br>several recent joint counternarcotics operations. Tadic stated 
<br>that undertaking such sensitive operations was politically risky 
<br>and Serbia would continue to do the right thing; in return, 
<br>however, Serbia hoped for similarly strong bilateral engagement in 
<br>other areas and expected support from the U.S. on these efforts 
<br>with other countries in the region. The Ambassador expressed U.S. 
<br>appreciation for Serbia's strong cooperation in these important 
<br>areas and said she would be glad to discuss any areas of specific 
<br>concern. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Regional Cooperation 
<br>
<br>-------------------- 
<br>
<br>BELGRADE 00000019 003 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) The Ambassador noted the important role that Serbia can and 
<br>needs to play on regional relations and stability, particularly 
<br>with regard to Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. She conveyed 
<br>appreciation for the Serbian government's constructive support of 
<br>the Butmir process and urged Tadic to remain engaged with the 
<br>parties, including RS leader Milorad Dodik, in particular. She 
<br>expressed USG concern about the prospect of any referendum moving 
<br>forward in the Republika Srpska. Tadic said that Serbia believed 
<br>the preservation of BiH's territorial integrity was paramount; as a 
<br>guarantor of the Dayton Accords, Serbia sought a peaceful solution 
<br>on constitutional reform that would be consistent with Dayton 
<br>principles and preserve the model of two entities, three 
<br>constituent peoples. Tadic noted that he was seeking a 
<br>parliamentary resolution on Srebrenica to recognize the gravity of 
<br>the crimes committed there. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) With regard to Croatia, Tadic said that he had known 
<br>President-elect Ivo Josipovic for a long time and wanted to work 
<br>with him to address the many different open issues such as the 
<br>"huge problem" of refugees and property rights. He said he 
<br>expected the U.S. to support Serbian efforts to improve that 
<br>relationship and address the outstanding issues. Tadic told the 
<br>Ambassador that he would soon visit Albania and commented on the 
<br>enormous organized crime problem facing Montenegro, where he also 
<br>requested U.S. support. He emphasized that Serbia supported the 
<br>independence and territorial integrity of its neighbors in the 
<br>region, but many issues needed to be addressed. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Turning to Kosovo, Tadic told the Ambassador "I must be as 
<br>clear as possible with you - Serbia will not change its views on 
<br>its territorial integrity. I want to be direct with you, as I have 
<br>with your other colleagues. After the International Court of 
<br>Justice (ICJ) issues its advisory opinion, we want to pursue 
<br>dialogue and find a way to address the issues related to Kosovo, as 
<br>the current situation is untenable." The Ambassador responded that 
<br>despite our clear differences, the U.S. and Serbia needed to keep 
<br>the channels of communication on Kosovo open. While the Vice 
<br>President had conveyed our agreement to disagree on Kosovo, it was 
<br>important for Serbia to focus on practical ways to improve the 
<br>lives of Serbs in Kosovo and on resolving outstanding issues. She 
<br>emphasized the need for Serbia to take a responsible and forward 
<br>looking approach after the ICJ opinion, consistent with President 
<br>Tadic's own forward looking approach toward European integration, 
<br>that would not do harm to stability in the region nor to the other 
<br>important work on our bilateral agenda. She recommended both sides 
<br>begin a dialogue now about how to manage the way forward and said 
<br>she hoped to continue discussions with Tadic's foreign policy 
<br>advisor, Jovan Ratkovic, on this subject as early as next week. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Comment 
<br>
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶11. (S) Comment: President Tadic made clear during the meeting 
<br>and in his public statement that he does not intend to back down on 
<br>Kosovo. At the same time, he demonstrated that he is open to 
<br>dialogue and told us what he wants: a warm reception in Washington 
<br>and continued high level engagement across the U.S. interagency, 
<br>cooperation on sensitive security issues, public support for 
<br>Serbia's efforts to improve regional relations, and sensitivity to 
<br>the domestic political constraints he faces on Kosovo policy. Now 
<br>is the opportune moment to lay out for Tadic and his key foreign 
<br>policy advisors what we expect of him, namely a constructive and 
<br>coordinated response to the ICJ's upcoming advisory opinion 
<br>accompanied by increased pragmatism in establishing a modus vivendi 
<br>
<br>BELGRADE 00000019 004 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>with Kosovo, and continued forceful engagement with Milorad Dodik 
<br>to preserve stability in BiH. In the coming months, high-level 
<br>Washington engagement with Tadic will be essential to drive these 
<br>messages home. The other sine qua non is a strong, consistent 
<br>message from the European Union that continued antagonism and 
<br>inflexibility on Kosovo after the ICJ opinion will hamper Serbia's 
<br>progress toward membership. End Comment.

<br>the Presidency):

<br>
<br>
<br>ADDRESS BY 
<br>
<br>HIS EXCELLENCY MR. BORIS TADIC, PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF 
<br>SERBIA, ON THE 
<br>
<br>OCCASSION OF THE PRESENT A TION OF THE LETTERS OF CREDENCE BY HER 
<br>
<br>EXCELLENCY MRS. MARY WARLICK, AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND 
<br>
<br>PLENIPOTENTIARY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO 
<br>
<br>THE REPUBLIC OF SERBIA 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Belgrade, 28 January 2010 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Excellency, 
<br>
<br>It is my great pleasure to receive the Letters by which the 
<br>Honorable Barack Obama, President of the United States of America 
<br>is accrediting you as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary 
<br>to the Republic of Serbia. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>May I ask you, Excellency, to convey to President Obama my cordial 
<br>greetings and the assurances of my highest consideration. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>The relationship with the United States of America is one of the 
<br>pillars of the foreign policy of the Republic of Serbia. Ever since 
<br>the times when the interests of our country in the United States of 
<br>America were represented by the diplomat and the well-known 
<br>scientist of Serbian origin Mihailo Pupin, the bilateral relations 
<br>between our two countries have been characterized by friendship and 
<br>alliance at all turning points in the world's history of the 
<br>twentieth century. Such relations and all-round cooperation were 
<br>damaged at the time of the regime of Slobodan Milosevic. Following 
<br>the democratic changed in Serbia, we have restored our close 
<br>cooperation which entered a new quality phase after the visit of 
<br>Vice-President Biden. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Today, Serbia is a truly democratic country. In the past ten years 
<br>of the democratic transition we have successfully implemented many 
<br>reforms guaranteeing the respect of human rights, minority rights, 
<br>media freedoms and free elections. We are very grateful for the 
<br>assistance by the United States of America in this democratization 
<br>process in Serbia. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>We are particularly satisfied with the successful cooperation that 
<br>we established with the United States of America in combating 
<br>international terrorism and organized crime. 
<br>
<br>BELGRADE 00000019 005 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>Excellency, 
<br>
<br>Large Serbian community in America has for centuries provided a 
<br>link between our two countries and contributed to the creation of 
<br>American society. Serbia is a sister state with the State of 
<br>Illinois and the main partner of the Army of Serbia is the National 
<br>Guard of Ohio. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>We are particularly pleased with the fact that American companies 
<br>are among the biggest foreign investors in Serbia. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Madam Ambassador, 
<br>
<br>Becoming a full member of the European Union is the strategic goal 
<br>of the Republic of Serbia. We are convinced that the European Union 
<br>will not be complete until Serbia and other Western Balkan 
<br>countries are integrated into it. The support of the United States 
<br>of America in that regard is of exceptional importance. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Madam Ambassador, 
<br>
<br>Serbia will continue to defend its sovereignty and territorial 
<br>integrity in Kosovo by political and diplomatic means. We would 
<br>like 2010 to be the year of peaceful, compromise and realistic 
<br>solution of this issue, after the International Court of Justice 
<br>renders its advisory opinion. Despite different positions that we 
<br>have regarding the status of Kosovo, we hope that American policy 
<br>will respect legitimate Serbian interests and that it will not 
<br>jeopardize democracy in Serbia. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>At the same time, Serbia is very much concerned about the plans of 
<br>Pristina to forcefully establish its rule over the majority-Serb 
<br>northern Kosovo. If this strategy were to be implemented it would 
<br>have unforeseen consequences for the stability of the region. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Excellency, 
<br>
<br>Serbia is strongly committed to strengthening the regional 
<br>cooperation and good-neighbourly relations. Without a stable, 
<br>democratic Serbia it is not possible to imagine the stable and 
<br>prosperous Western Balkans. Serbia respects the sovereignty and 
<br>territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, its internal 
<br>arrangements defined by the Dayton Accords as well as the European 
<br>and Euro-Atlantic integration of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Excellency, 
<br>
<br>You begin your mission at the very important time for the Republic 
<br>of Serbia but also for the further development of the relations 
<br>between our two countries. I wish you every success in the 
<br>discharge of your responsible duties. l am convinced that with your 
<br>knowledge and experience you will make an important contribution to 
<br>the development of the overall cooperation between our two 
<br>countries.
