<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) Summary: Indigenous conflict -- particularly between
<br>Mapuche and non-indigenous land owners in southern Chile -- has
<br>forced itself prominently on to President Bachelet's political
<br>agenda following the August 12 police killing of a Mapuche
<br>activist. Over the past 20 years, relations between the government
<br>and Mapuche communities have been characterized by half-hearted
<br>attempts by the government and fractious organization and demands
<br>by the Mapuche, creating disappointment and frustration that
<br>perpetuate tension. Mapuche demands center on land, economic
<br>opportunity, and societal inclusion, but are poorly defined and
<br>vary greatly from community to community. End Summary.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) Poloff and Pol Specialist travelled to the heart of Chile's
<br>Mapuche territory, the regions of Araucania and Los Rios, August
<br>10-14. Reftel described the reality of tense, but generally
<br>non-violent, relations in contrast to the sensationalized images of
<br>the region. Septel will describe human right concerns and the
<br>justice process.

<br>
<br>After Mapuche Death, Indigenous Issues Claim Center Stage
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------------
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶3. (U) The August 12 police killing of Mapuche activist Jaime
<br>Mendoza -- and the subsequent reaction from indigenous communities
<br>-- has catapulted indigenous demands to the front of President
<br>Bachelet's political agenda once again. Mapuche activists held
<br>protests and blockaded a highway, while more than 3,000 mourners
<br>packed Mendoza's funeral. When President Bachelet sent a
<br>government delegation, led by the Under Secretary of the
<br>Presidency, to meet with all parties in Araucania, the Mapuche
<br>community refused to meet with the group. Bachelet subsequently
<br>named a cabinet minister, Jose Antonio Viera-Gallo, as the
<br>government's new indigenous policy coordinator, effectively
<br>capitulating to a long-standing Mapuche demand for higher-level
<br>government attention. Meanwhile, another indigenous group --
<br>Easter Islanders -- seem to have been inspired by Mapuche activism,
<br>recently occupying the island's only airport for 24 hours in a
<br>
<br>successful effort to gain government attention to their demands.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Dashed Hopes: Concertacion's Failed Indigenous Policies
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- -----------
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) Chile's return to democracy seemed to be a promising
<br>beginning for relations between the state and the Mapuche community
<br>after a history of conflict (reftel). The 1993 Indigenous Law
<br>legally recognized ethnic communities for the first time; protected
<br>current indigenous lands; created a fund to secure additional lands
<br>claimed by indigenous communities; established an indigenous
<br>development fund; and formed the National Corporation for
<br>Indigenous Development (CONADI), a new government body charged with
<br>implementing indigenous policy.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) Despite this encouraging start, indigenous Chileans have
<br>become frustrated with the Concertacion's broken promises,
<br>government inaction, and inefficient administration. Under Ricardo
<br>Lagos (1998-2004), the government approved the construction of a
<br>hydroelectric dam in Mapuche areas, despite more than a decade of
<br>strenuous objections from Mapuche activists. He later issued a
<br>last minute and poorly explained cancellation to what would have
<br>been the largest ever meeting between the Mapuche community and the
<br>Chilean President, angering thousands who had travelled from across
<br>the country for the dialogue.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) For her part, President Bachelet has been slow to focus
<br>on indigenous issues. She announced her indigenous policy,
<br>Re-Conocer, more than half way through her four-year term and in
<br>response to the outcry over the police shooting death of a Mapuche
<br>activist in January 2008. Critics charge (and privately some
<br>CONADI officials agree) that Re-Conocer is just re-packaging
<br>previous policies and creating more bureaucracy. Bachelet's
<br>presidential commissioner for indigenous affairs, Rodrigo Egana,
<br>
<br>was described by a prominent civic leader and close friend as
<br>"focused elsewhere."
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) Moreover, the very organization that was meant to assist
<br>indigenous Chileans, CONADI, has become a lightning rod for native
<br>criticism. CONADI is decried as a bureaucratic and lethargic
<br>organization which, by looking to hire talented indigenous
<br>professionals, has co-opted many of the indigenous communities'
<br>best leaders. More than 90% of the agency's budget is dedicated to
<br>purchasing ancestral lands, yet land disputes appear to be
<br>worsening rather than subsiding. CONADI aims to boost
<br>opportunities for indigenous Chileans through scholarships and
<br>micro-enterprise support, but these grants are small (average USD
<br>6,000 for micro-enterprises), short-term, and labor-intensive to
<br>administer, further eating up resources. Several Mapuche and
<br>non-indigenous sources told us that only 30% of CONADI's budget
<br>actually reaches the communities it intends to serve, with the rest
<br>being lost to bureaucracy, waste, and inflated land prices.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Land, Opportunity, and Respect: Mapuche Demands
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶8. (U) The recovery of traditional Mapuche lands is the most
<br>common trigger for violent conflict and property destruction.
<br>Mapuche communities now live on just 6% of the territory they once
<br>controlled -- an unsettling situation for a people whose name means
<br>"people of the land." Activists are quick to point out that some
<br>wealthy white Chilean individuals -- such as forestry magnate
<br>Roberto Angelini -- own more land in traditional Mapuche areas than
<br>the entire Mapuche population combined. On the other hand,
<br>non-indigenous Chileans often have strong ties to the formerly
<br>Mapuche land they now own. Due to government colonization
<br>policies, some non-indigenous Chileans have lived on traditional
<br>Mapuche lands for generations, while many prominent businessmen
<br>have made substantial investments in land that they bought legally.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶9. (SBU) The 1993 Indigenous Law, while designed to address these
<br>land concerns, has in some ways exacerbated the situation. The law
<br>provided a mechanism and funding to buy back traditional Mapuche
<br>land, but failed to set expectations about how much land would be
<br>recovered. The resulting process has been expensive, extremely
<br>slow, and resulted in less new land for Mapuches than they
<br>expected. Non-indigenous land owners often engage in price
<br>gouging, raising prices for disputed land to ridiculous levels,
<br>limiting the amount of land that can be purchased with budgeted
<br>funds. While the Chilean government has transferred more than
<br>650,000 hectares for Mapuche use, the vast majority of this land
<br>was already de facto Mapuche territory -- the purchase simply
<br>regularized the facts on the ground. Human rights campaigner Jose
<br>Aylwin told poloffs that only about 100,000 hectares of new land
<br>has been turned over to Mapuches since 1993.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶10. (SBU) Aside from land disputes, poverty, lack of opportunity,
<br>and discrimination by majority Chilean culture are all underlying
<br>causes of conflict. The poverty rate for indigenous people is 12
<br>percentage points higher than for non-indigenous populations.
<br>Araucania -- the region with the highest percentage of Mapuche
<br>residents -- has the country's highest unemployment rate, nearly 11
<br>percent. And Mapuches face widespread discrimination.
<br>Multiculturalism is an uncommon term in a country that takes pride
<br>in its unitary "Chileanness," which is enshrined in the
<br>constitution. Mapuche academics in Temuco and Valdivia told
<br>Poloffs of experiences demonstrating how anti-Mapuche racism is
<br>acceptable even among well-educated Chileans. Typical Chilean
<br>attitudes toward Mapuches range from ignorance to distrust.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Who Speaks for the Mapuche?
<br>
<br>---------------------------
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶11. (SBU) The decentralized hierarchy and diffuse leadership that
<br>characterize Mapuche culture (described as a "multi-headed hydra"
<br>by one academic) impede community efforts to organize and
<br>complicate Chilean government efforts to find a valid negotiating
<br>
<br>partner. Mapuche villages are traditionally quite independent from
<br>one another, and are led by lonkos, or tribal chiefs.
<br>Traditionally, no authority exists beyond the lonko, meaning that
<br>no single person or organization speaks for the Mapuche. Because
<br>each lonko is viewed as the ultimate authority for his, admittedly
<br>very small, group of Mapuches, slights are inevitable as some
<br>Mapuches claim that each lonko should have access directly to the
<br>President, who represents the ultimate authority in majoritarian
<br>Chilean culture. Even more realistic Mapuche activists bristle
<br>when lonkos can not get meetings with the regional intendente
<br>(centrally appointed governor) and instead deal with lower-ranking
<br>civil servants.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶12. (SBU) The on-going conflict with the government has led to the
<br>creation of new leadership structures across and within
<br>communities, from the sometimes violent Coordinadora Arauco Malleco
<br>(CAM) to the more pacifist Council of All Lands, to
<br>community-specific organizations with elected leadership. The
<br>newly created Mapuche Territorial Alliance aims to unite disparate
<br>Mapuche communities in a peaceful struggle for land rights. Within
<br>communities, the Chilean government has dictated that it will work
<br>only with elected representative Mapuche councils, leading to the
<br>creation of new bodies which supporters say are an effective way to
<br>make decisions and interact with the government, while detractors
<br>lament the loss of lonko authority and say that the council members
<br>have been co-opted.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶13. (SBU) These new organizations, and the positions that some of
<br>them take, reflect the deep divisions in the Mapuche community.
<br>There is no consensus on what approach to take in seeking redress,
<br>or even on what the community's issues and goals are. In meetings
<br>with two lonkos in neighboring communities, one described his
<br>efforts to promote community-based tourism, gain access to CONADI
<br>resources and grants, and share traditional knowledge about local
<br>wildlife. In contrast, another lonko described his work on a
<br>proposal that would demand the return of all land from the Biobio
<br>river to the city of Palena -- an area compromising the majority of
<br>four of Chile's 15 regions -- end all major investment projects in
<br>the region, and dismantle CONADI.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) Comment: There is plenty of blame in Chile's
<br>long-standing Mapuche conflict to spread to all parties. Mapuche
<br>communities are disorganized and incoherent, offering up a range of
<br>demands from the logical to the fanciful, and rarely coordinating
<br>their efforts. A small number of violent actors discredit those
<br>who work in good faith to advance legitimate grievances. On the
<br>other hand, successive Concertacion governments have bungled
<br>indigenous policy, perpetually making it a low priority and failing
<br>to set and meet realistic expectations. Even with Bachelet's
<br>decision to designate a new, and higher-ranking indigenous policy
<br>coordinator, it is difficult to envision substantial progress in
<br>resolving this complex, long-standing issue. End Comment.
