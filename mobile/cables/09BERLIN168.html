<br>BERLIN 00000168  001.2 OF 002 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: CHARGE D'AFFAIRES JOHN KOENIG. REASONS: 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY.  The sudden resignation of Economics Minister 
<br>Michael Glos (CSU) on February 7 caught Chancellor Angela 
<br>Merkel (CDU) and her party off guard at a time when 
<br>addressing Germany's economic downturn is paramount.  To 
<br>minimize damage, the CSU quickly replaced Glos with its 
<br>Secretary General Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, a decision 
<br>which continues to draw criticism from other parties as well 
<br>as from within the CDU due to thirty-seven-year-old,s 
<br>minimal background in economic policy.  The shuffle reveals 
<br>strains between the CDU and CSU, and presents an opportunity 
<br>for Merkel's political foes to portray her as lacking control 
<br>as the country tries to deal with its worst economic crisis 
<br>since World War II.  END SUMMARY. 
<br> 
<br>INITIAL CONFUSION OVER RESIGNATION 
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) Citing his age and intention to leave the cabinet 
<br>after the September 2009 elections, the sixty-four-year-old 
<br>Glos submitted his resignation as Minister for Economics and 
<br>Technology on February 7.  Chairman of the Christian Social 
<br>Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party of Chancellor Merkel's 
<br>Christian Democratic Union (CDU), and Bavarian Minister 
<br>President Horst Seehofer named Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, 
<br>37, as his successor.  Zu Guttenberg had been CSU Secretary 
<br>General for only three months following a major party 
<br>reshuffle.  Glos explained his departure would allow the CSU 
<br>to campaign with a new minister in place, and help restore 
<br>trust in the CSU following its poor showing in the Bavarian 
<br>regional elections in September 2008.  The timing of his 
<br>departure -- during the financial and economic crises -- 
<br>however, was awkward.  In addition, Glos submitted his 
<br>resignation to Seehofer instead of Merkel, which the media 
<br>has portrayed as a snub to the Chancellor.  (NOTE: Bavarian 
<br>political reactions to be reported in ConGen Munich SEPTEL.) 
<br> 
<br>ENTER THE YOUNG TURK 
<br>-------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (SBU) Under pressure to resolve an apparent power vacuum 
<br>at a key ministry, Seehofer, who as CSU Party Chairman had 
<br>the right to fill the slot, had to find a replacement for 
<br>Glos quickly.  At a February 9 press conference announcing 
<br>the choice of zu Guttenberg, Seehofer said that he chose the 
<br>rising CSU star partly in order to have a minister 
<br>representing the northern region of Bavaria.  He lauded zu 
<br>Guttenberg's international contacts and his presumed ability 
<br>to promote German exports.  Seehofer denied reports that 
<br>before accepting the new post, zu Guttenberg had demanded the 
<br>high-level position of CSU Bundestag Spokesman and CDU/CSU 
<br>Caucus Chief in case the CDU/CSU lost the September 
<br>elections.  For his part, zu Guttenberg welcomed the 
<br>opportunity to take on the economics portfolio.  He described 
<br>Germany's "social market economy" as the "guiding principle" 
<br>of his economic thinking, and underscored the importance of 
<br>free trade.  Zu Guttenberg also said he would work to lower 
<br>taxes for small- and medium-sized companies. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>GLOS'S ROUGH RIDE 
<br>----------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) Glos had always been an awkward fit for the Economics 
<br>Ministry job, which he took on in November 2005.  Glos did 
<br>bring intimate knowledge of federal politics to the job, but 
<br>was not an economist and had never shown strong interest in 
<br>the Economics Ministry's portfolio.  Chancellor Merkel 
<br>instinctively turned to her Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck 
<br>(SPD) to coordinate the response to the financial crisis, 
<br>sidelining Glos.  Glos's inability to overcome CDU and SPD 
<br>objectives and get additional tax cuts into the stimulus plan 
<br>may have cost the CSU the recent Bavarian elections, to the 
<br>dismay of Seehofer and others in the CSU. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) A devastating profile of Glos a few months ago in "Der 
<br>Spiegel," whose main points Ministry contacts did not 
<br>contadict, portrayed him as weak, out of touch with the 
<br>bureaucracy, bored with his job, and looking forward to a 
<br>nice sinecure for himself after retirement.  In a farewell 
<br> 
<br>BERLIN 00000168  002.2 OF 002 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>meeting with former Ambassador Timken in late November 2008, 
<br>Glos appeared under great strain and confessed to tremendous 
<br>frustration over his inability to influence Merkel on tax 
<br>cuts as part of the stimulus package. 
<br> 
<br>NO LOVE LOST 
<br>------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) SPD party stalwarts are giddy over perceived turmoil 
<br>in the CSU and the perception that Merkel is not in control 
<br>of developments.  Chancellor-candidate Frank-Walter 
<br>Steinmeier (SPD) said the CDU/CSU lacked "orientation" in 
<br>their management of the economic crisis and called for "party 
<br>order and discipline."  A CDU staffer expressed irritation 
<br>over Seehofer's handling of the shuffle, but she shed no 
<br>tears over Glos's departure.  On zu Guttenberg, FDP economics 
<br>expert Rainer Bruederle commented to us that "as far as 
<br>economics is concerned, it seems to be enough these days for 
<br>the CSU to find someone who can read and write." 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) The business community has mixed views.  An IBM 
<br>lobbyist told Econoff that she regarded Glos as the only 
<br>"counterweight to Steinbrueck" on economic policymaking in 
<br>the Germany government.  A contact from the German industry 
<br>association (BDI) conceded that Glos was "not the strongest 
<br>Minister in the Cabinet," adding that BDI had often wished 
<br>for someone in the position who was "more outspoken."  On zu 
<br>Guttenberg, he conceded the new Minister was well-versed in 
<br>foreign policy and transatlantic issues, though young and 
<br>inexperienced. 
<br> 
<br>COMMENT 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (C) Glos's resignation caught the CDU/CSU party hierarchy 
<br>off-guard at a time when everyone in Berlin and Munich was 
<br>concentrating on the Munich Security Conference.  This 
<br>high-profile resignation opens the door to criticism of 
<br>Merkel,s handling of the economic and financial crises, as 
<br>well as Seehofer's leadership style.  Zu Guttenberg's first 
<br>challenge will be to help resolve the debate between the 
<br>CDU/CSU and SPD over the stimulus package.  His appointment 
<br>has been heavily criticized within the CDU, with some calling 
<br>him a mere "place holder" until the September elections, 
<br>raising questions about Merkel,s ability to steer her party 
<br>effectively through a long &super8 election year. If not 
<br>addressed, the SPD and the opposition FDP could emerge 
<br>strengthened by the affair, which has come at a very 
<br>inopportune time for Chancellor Merkel,s CDU and its sister 
<br>party, the CSU. END COMMENT.
