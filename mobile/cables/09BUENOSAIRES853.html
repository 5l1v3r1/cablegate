<br>¶1. (S/NF) Summary/Introduction. The devastating setback
<br>dealt by Argentine voters to the government in the June 28
<br>mid-term elections has restored to respectability last year's
<br>fashionable political forecast -- that Cristina Fernandez de
<br>Kirchner (CFK) will not reach the end of her term as
<br>President in 2011. Like last year, some of this conjecture
<br>is little more than wishful thinking by the government's
<br>opponents, but not all of it. The ruling couple's political
<br>weakness, erratic behavior, looming economic challenges, and
<br>Argentina's history of truncated presidential terms lead some
<br>serious observers to worry about the government's staying
<br>power. A larger group of observers, this Mission included,
<br>believe that CFK will probably make it to the end of her
<br>term, if only by muddling through (reftel). In this report,
<br>we evaluate the main arguments behind the proposition that
<br>the Fernandez de Kirchner government will fall and explain
<br>why we and others think that, at present, that scenario
<br>remains unlikely. End Summary/Introduction.
<br>
<br>Kirchner Vulnerability: A New Phenomenon
<br>-----------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) The Kirchners' political weakness is still a
<br>relatively new phenomenon, dating back to their mishandling
<br>of last year's farm protests. In the run-up to the October
<br>2007 presidential elections, public approval ratings for
<br>outgoing President Nestor Kirchner (NK) went as high as 77%,
<br>as Argentines credited him for the country's remarkable
<br>economic recovery after its 2001-02 economic meltdown.
<br>Buoyed by her husband's popularity, Cristina Fernandez de
<br>Kirchner (CFK) easily won the presidency in the first round
<br>of the 2007 election. With 45% of the vote, she outdistanced
<br>her nearest opponent by more than twenty percentage points
<br>and doubled the vote received in 2003 by NK, who was then the
<br>little-known governor of remote Santa Cruz. The ruling
<br>couple's considerable political capital dissipated last year
<br>as a consequence of their confrontation with the farm sector.
<br>CFK and NK's plummeting poll numbers, their sudden inability
<br>to stay ahead of the curve, and their abandonment by many of
<br>their allies set the stage for a humiliating Senate defeat of
<br>government legislation that would have ratified the export
<br>tax increase at the heart of the controversy one year ago.
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) This political rout led to speculation in 2008
<br>that CFK might fail to reach the end of her term -- which
<br>would make her the first elected Peronist president since the
<br>restoration of democracy in 1983 to meet that ignominious
<br>fate. We even spotted the graffitied question "Se Kae?"
<br>(roughly translated, "Kollapsing?") on a few Buenos Aires
<br>walls last year. Much of the speculation was fed by the
<br>government's most bitter opponents. Diego Guelar, a foreign
<br>policy advisor to Buenos Aires Mayor Mauricio Macri, told a
<br>visiting congressional staffer last August that "this
<br>government won't last 60 days" -- just minutes after his boss
<br>had said that it would. But there was concern within
<br>government circles. A former aide to Buenos Aires Province
<br>Governor Daniel Scioli confided to us recently that he and
<br>other colleagues had urged Scioli to break ranks with the
<br>Kirchners last year over the farm controversy. Scioli said
<br>he wouldn't because "If I do, they'll fall, and I'm no coup
<br>monger." During the farm crisis, the MFA even took the
<br>unusual step of registering its concern with the Embassy.
<br>Foreign Minister Taiana's Chief of Staff Alberto D'Alotto
<br>(protect) told a Mission contact in May 2008 that the MFA was
<br>"very concerned" about the government's staying power.
<br>
<br>The Prophets of Doom
<br>--------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) In the end, the Kirchner government survived the
<br>farm crisis and made it into 2009. With its defeat in the
<br>June 28 mid-term election, the speculation has returned,
<br>though it has not reached last year's fever pitch. (A large
<br>majority of analysts do not/not feel that it is the most
<br>likely scenario.) Those who predict an early exit for the
<br>Kirchners tend to stress to varying degrees the following
<br>factors that, in their view, make a Kirchner collapse more
<br>likely:
<br>
<br>-- Political: The Kirchners' opponents smell blood after the
<br>June 28 election and are waiting for the right moment to
<br>remove them, abetted by a public that abhors weak leaders;
<br>
<br>-- Psychological: The Kirchner psychodrama is contributing to
<br>a series of bad decisions that will lead to the first
<br>couple's political demise; and
<br>
<br>BUENOS AIR 00000853 002 OF 005
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>-- Economic: The ruling couple's post-election turn to the
<br>left dooms them to botch an increasingly difficult economic
<br>situation, sweeping CFK from office.
<br>
<br>Se Kae: Political Arguments and Scenarios
<br>-----------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) There are some influential political analysts
<br>(Rosendo Fraga, and with less certainty, Manuel Mora y
<br>Araujo) who believe that this country's political volatility
<br>will cause CFK's fall from power. Mora y Araujo argues that
<br>Argentine society abhors weak political leadership. If
<br>Argentines sense that their ruler is enfeebled, he argues,
<br>they tend to collectively say "that's enough." The
<br>consequent withdrawal of support makes the damaged ruler
<br>vulnerable to overthrow by the scheming political class. The
<br>governor of Tierra del Fuego told the CDA that Argentines
<br>were "absolutists" in how they viewed politicians as either
<br>winners or losers, with no gray areas in between.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Echoing a commonly heard refrain, pollster Doris
<br>Capurro adds that the Argentine press, particularly the
<br>dominant Clarin media group, often serves as "Coup Central."
<br>Clarin, she said, fomented Fernando de la Rua's departure
<br>from power in 2001, and its owners are fierce critics of the
<br>Kirchners. For their part, most politicians have focused on
<br>jockeying for future position, but a few important ones
<br>sometimes seem to be circling prey. Civic Coalition leader
<br>Elisa Carrio said soon after the GOA's mid-term loss that "if
<br>Cristina doesn't react within a week, she's going to have
<br>problems governing." Along the same lines, Radical leader
<br>Gerardo Morales said a few days ago that "if the (current)
<br>dialogue falls apart, the Government will have so little
<br>margin for error that anything could happen." Over the
<br>weekend, dissident labor leader Luis Barrionuevo said plainly
<br>that "I see Julio Cobos finishing Cristina's term."
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) Fraga argues that the history of Argentina's
<br>post-dictatorship democracy does not bode well for the
<br>Kirchners. Over that 25-year period, three elected
<br>governments lost mid-terms. The two that were led by
<br>Radicals (Alfonsin in 1987 and de la Rua in 2001) did not
<br>survive; the one headed by a Peronist (Menem in 1997) made it
<br>to the term's end. But Fraga thinks that the Kirchners
<br>should take little comfort from Menem's survival. Unlike the
<br>Kirchners, Menem never lost control of the Congress nor his
<br>hold over the Peronist party. Economist Carlos Melconian
<br>adds that in 1997 "the economy was doing fine, and economic
<br>policy remained on autopilot until the presidential elections
<br>two years later."
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Fraga thinks that the Kirchners will fail to change
<br>course, leading to the gradual deterioration of their already
<br>dire political situation. He pointed out that with Manuel
<br>Zelaya's overthrow in Honduras, CFK (with approval ratings
<br>around 28%) is now the elected Latin American president with
<br>the lowest popularity rating in her country. According to
<br>Fraga, the December 10 seating of the victors of the June 28
<br>election will create a Congress with the power to remove CFK
<br>from office. (Note: Impeachment and removal from
<br>presidential office would actually require two-thirds support
<br>in each chamber of Congress, which the opposition -- even
<br>after December 10 -- will not have.) Fraga believes that
<br>Peronists and forces close to Vice President Julio Cobos will
<br>conspire to remove CFK from office to replace her with Cobos.
<br>Fraga describes the scenario as perfect for Peronists -- it
<br>removes the Kirchners from the scene, follows the
<br>Constitutional line of succession, and saddles Radical Cobos
<br>with the burden of taking the tough political decisions
<br>needed to govern Argentina in an economic downturn. For the
<br>non-Peronist opposition, the scenario seems less attractive
<br>-- a senior Radical politician has described it to us as a
<br>trap -- but Fraga maintains that the ambitious Vice President
<br>has already decided to accept power in such a circumstance.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) As for the Kirchners, Fraga claims that they
<br>(especially Nestor) may see this scenario as their best
<br>long-term bet if their political situation deteriorates
<br>further. They would portray CFK's forced removal from
<br>office, in this view, as an illegitimate usurpation of the
<br>democratic order, enabling them to escape to a sympathetic
<br>foreign country as democratic martyrs. They would then hope
<br>that the situation under Cobos would degenerate into
<br>political and economic chaos, helping to set the stage for
<br>their eventual political comeback. For Fraga, this strategy
<br>explains CFK's deep interest in the coup against Manuel
<br>Zelaya, which took place on the same weekend as her electoral
<br>setback. It also, he says, means that she will not resign,
<br>regardless of how bad the political situation.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Psychodrama: Behavioral Arguments
<br>----------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶10. (S/NF) Other observers stress psychological factors in
<br>their prediction of an impending democratic crisis. This
<br>school of thought has two variants: that strongman NK is too
<br>set in his uncompromising ways to adapt, or that he (or he
<br>and CFK) are becoming increasingly erratic and incapable of
<br>governing. As a well-connected banker told us, the Kirchners
<br>could recover by altering course and embracing a more
<br>moderate and consensus-driven course, but NK in particular is
<br>incapable of change. Instead, in this view, he will embark
<br>on a disastrous jeremiad against internal "traitors" whom he
<br>blames for the electoral defeat, leading the government off a
<br>cliff. In support of this view, Fraga argues that Nestor's
<br>personality "cannot change," but that Argentine public
<br>opinion has. It no longer wants an obdurate fighter as it
<br>did when NK took office in 2003; these days, Argentines want
<br>consensual leadership that the Kirchners cannot and will not
<br>provide.
<br>
<br>¶11. (S/NF) According to the second variant, Nestor has
<br>indeed changed. In fact, he's gone crazy. Jorge Brito, once
<br>known as "Nestor's banker," seems to believe this theory,
<br>confiding to the CDA that NK appears increasingly obsessive
<br>and disinclined to listen to advice. "He used to listen to
<br>me," Brito recalled, "but now he doesn't bother." Another
<br>banker told us that "Nestor has basically had a nervous
<br>breakdown."
<br>
<br>Economic Arguments: Surf's Up
<br>-----------------------------
<br>
<br>¶12. (SBU) Some economists and financial market participants
<br>stress that economic factors are most likely to lead to the
<br>Kirchners' downfall. In the words of economist Carlos
<br>Melconian (a Macri ally), "whenever Argentine governments
<br>that came out weakened from mid-term elections faced a
<br>deteriorating economic situation, the result was an economic
<br>policy that aimed at 'surfing' the economic waves. However,
<br>the surfing strategy may have to be aborted halfway: the
<br>economy may collapse before the date of the presidential
<br>elections, as was the case in the Alfonsin-Menem transition
<br>between 1987 and 1989." In other words, unless CFK's
<br>government raises its economic policy game, it may face the
<br>same bleak fate as the Alfonsin and de la Rua governments.
<br>
<br>¶13. (C/NF) But the prospects for more sensible economic
<br>policies seem slim, prompting some to suggest that the GOA
<br>will be overwhelmed by the economy's many problems. The
<br>GOA's economic policy team is an object of derision among
<br>serious economists here. Miguel Broda complains that
<br>"there's not a single serious macroeconomist on the whole
<br>Economy Ministry staff." Banker Brito described the GOA to
<br>us as "made up of people who can't even add or subtract." He
<br>was particularly scathing about Guillermo Moreno, the
<br>Internal Commerce Secretary who serves as NK's
<br>Interventionist in Chief, whom he called a "psychopath" who
<br>"thinks he's a genius" but "is as dumb as the rest of them."
<br>Mario Blejer, a former Central Bank chief and IMF Officer who
<br>reportedly turned down an offer to take over the Economy
<br>Ministry a few weeks ago, told the CDA that the problem is
<br>Nestor's control over GOA economic policy. According to
<br>Blejer, "Nestor knows nothing about economics, and to make
<br>matters worse, he thinks he does, so he doesn't listen to
<br>advice." This leads to an economic policy framework
<br>described by another former Central Bank president as
<br>"autistic."
<br>
<br>¶14. (C/NF) These economy-focused pessimists disagree on what
<br>the precipitating cause of a government collapse might be.
<br>The financial community's leading bear, Deutsche Bank
<br>Argentina's president Marcelo Blanco, focuses on the
<br>possibility of another sovereign default, noting that the GOA
<br>faces several challenging payments in the near-term future,
<br>starting with more than US$ two billion in "Boden 2012"
<br>payments that come due in August. (According to Blejer,
<br>another US$10.5 billion in debt payments awaits the GOA in
<br>2010.) Blanco told econoff that he thought there was a "high
<br>probability" that the economy will spin out of control
<br>post-election and the Kirchners will ultimately be unable to
<br>govern.
<br>
<br>¶15. (C/NF) Political analyst Jorge Castro stresses the
<br>government's fiscal situation as the Kirchners' Achilles
<br>heel. The GOA, he argues, is ungovernable without a fiscal
<br>surplus. If the central government's fiscal accounts fall
<br>into deficit, he said, the government could collapse. The
<br>Kirchners, in particular, have relied on their discretionary
<br>
<br>BUENOS AIR 00000853 004 OF 005
<br>
<br>
<br>control of federal revenue sharing to keep governors and
<br>mayors in line. If the GOA starts suffering cash flow
<br>problems, it could encounter political turbulence and have to
<br>contend with rebellious governors. Brito worries that
<br>radicalization of the regime's economic agenda could be the
<br>straw that breaks the camel's back. If NK pursues more
<br>radical economic measures, such as pursuing new
<br>nationalizations, he told us, the GOA's core of support would
<br>shrink from 30 to 15% percent of the population, setting the
<br>stage for its abrupt demise. Another economist, Orlando
<br>Ferreres, suggests that in such a scenario the Peronists
<br>would be the ones who depose CFK, reasoning that "no one is
<br>more conservative than a frightened Peronist."
<br>
<br>Why We Think CFK Will Make It to 2011
<br>-------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶16. (C/NF) This recompilation of many arguments making the
<br>rounds about the durability of CFK's regime is not intended
<br>to create the impression that the government is doomed. At
<br>the Mission, we believe that CFK will remain president until
<br>December 2011, and that remains the opinion of most of our
<br>interlocutors here -- a motley crew that includes
<br>anti-Kirchneristas like Eduardo Duhalde and Mauricio Macri,
<br>press moguls like Clarin managing director Jose Aranda, and
<br>former Kirchner Cabinet chief Alberto Fernandez. We recently
<br>wrote a cable (reftel) on the reasons why we thought that a
<br>muddling-through scenario was most likely. Rather than
<br>recapitulating all of those arguments here, we outline the
<br>main political and economic factors supporting the contention
<br>that CFK will remain president until 2011.
<br>
<br>¶17. (C/NF) Our best-connected contacts in the political
<br>establishment tell us that the focus is on the 2011
<br>presidential election, not coup plotting. A key Macri aide
<br>tells us that the main contenders for the 2011 election --
<br>his boss, Carlos Reutemann, and Hermes Binner, to name a few
<br>-- have predicated their planning on CFK making it to the end
<br>of her term. None find taking the reins at a time of
<br>economic crisis particularly appealing, and CFK's premature
<br>departure could undermine their respective strategies for
<br>making it to the Casa Rosada in 2011, when the economy should
<br>be stronger. The preferences of these frontrunners are
<br>critical, because in the wake of the June 28 elections, they
<br>influence other political actors.
<br>
<br>¶18. (C/NF) To further complicate the lives of would-be coup
<br>plotters, CFK is a Peronist. The fractious Peronist
<br>establishment, though undoubtedly disgruntled with the
<br>Kirchners, is unlikely to end CFK's term if those efforts
<br>could redound to the benefit of non-Peronist politicians.
<br>Political analyst Mora y Araujo notes that, since 1983,
<br>Peronist presidents have proven far harder to dislodge from
<br>office before the end of their term than non-Peronists. We
<br>would also point out that the Kirchners' forte is tactical --
<br>they are generally more nimble and adroit than their rivals
<br>and opponents. That said, NK is also a high-stakes gambler,
<br>often betting heavily on the element of surprise in dealing
<br>with his adversaries. Given his penchant for
<br>unpredictability, he could easily over-play his hand one of
<br>these days, and one of his "surprise" moves may backfire on
<br>him.
<br>
<br>¶19. (C/NF) The fear factor also plays in CFK's favor.
<br>Opposition politicians from both the right (Mauricio Macri)
<br>and center-left (Radical leader Oscar Aguad) tell us that
<br>Argentines remember the chaos that followed Fernando de la
<br>Rua's departure from office in December 2001, and are not
<br>anxious to repeat the experience. Macri told a visiting U.S.
<br>Senate staffer last year that Argentines would be "happy" for
<br>the Kirchners to fall ("if this glass of water was the
<br>Kirchners, everyone would fight to push it over") except for
<br>one thing -- they fear that the government's collapse would
<br>risk a return to bedlam. Argentines also seem impassive or
<br>unmoved by outrageous cases of corruption or other
<br>developments that elsewhere would have caused major scandals
<br>("valijagate" comes to mind), making us wonder what it would
<br>take to get people into the streets.
<br>
<br>Most Think that the Economy Won't Push CFK from Office
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---------
<br>
<br>¶20. (C) Most of Argentina's best economists think that the
<br>economic situation will not force the Kirchners from office.
<br>Many post contacts believe that the peso exchange rate is a
<br>barometer for popular confidence in the government. The fact
<br>that the GOA has been able to manage a deliberate, controlled
<br>devaluation of the peso for over eight months without a major
<br>run on the dollar, even after the June 28 electoral setback,
<br>argues for a stable outlook. The notion that the economy
<br>
<br>BUENOS AIR 00000853 005 OF 005
<br>
<br>
<br>will bring the Kirchners down ultimately rests on the premise
<br>that the government will lack the funds to meet its internal
<br>and external obligations. For over two years we have been
<br>hearing dire forecasts of an impending, overwhelming fiscal
<br>crunch just around the corner. However, two of our best
<br>contacts -- Javier Alvaredo, General Manager of BICE Bank,
<br>and Juan Carlos Barboza, the Central Bank's foreign exchange
<br>chief -- tell us with some confidence that the GOA will be
<br>able to meet its obligations. On the external debt payments
<br>front, both of them said independently that the GOA will have
<br>enough funds to meet debt payments in 2009 and 2010. They
<br>argue that 2010 will be easier than 2009 because no GDP
<br>warrant payment will come due (there is a big one in December
<br>2009). The market, as measured by country risk ratings and
<br>bond indices, does not seem spooked.
<br>
<br>¶21. (SBU) Our contacts also tell us that the GOA is unlikely
<br>to run out of money before CFK's term ends. A contact in the
<br>Economy Ministry's Finance Secretariat insists that the GOA
<br>will meet its 2009 financing needs from public sector
<br>resources (e.g., the recent nationalization of private
<br>pension funds, which gives the GOA a huge pile of money to
<br>work with); inflows from International Financial Institutions
<br>like the World Bank and IDB; and liability management
<br>(buybacks, exchanges, etc.).
<br>
<br>¶22. (SBU) There is also room for adjustment on the
<br>expenditure side. Economist Daniel Marx notes that the
<br>government's decision to move the mid-term election to June
<br>28 means that its pre-electoral spending spree was relatively
<br>brief this year, which will make it easier for the new
<br>Economy Minister Amado Boudou to reduce outlays for the
<br>balance of this year and next. Marx thinks that social
<br>spending and subsidies will plummet now that the election is
<br>over, easing fiscal pressure on the government (though he
<br>admits that other pressures, such as transfer payments to the
<br>provinces demanded by increasingly assertive and desperate
<br>governors, will increase).
<br>
<br>¶23. (C/NF) Ultimately, popular support for, or tolerance of,
<br>the Kirchners rides on Argentines' relative sense of
<br>well-being. Barring another bout of hyper-inflation or
<br>government confiscation of savings or sudden uptick in
<br>unemployment, many Argentines are disinclined to rock the
<br>boat for now. Argentina is no stranger to nationwide general
<br>strikes that have paralyzed the country; it is a huge boon
<br>for the Kirchners that, for now, the bulk of organized labor
<br>(historically co-dependent on the Peronists) remains in their
<br>pockets.
<br>
<br>¶24. (C/NF) Finally, time is probably on the Kirchners' side.
<br>Though the economy is currently in bad shape, Argentina's
<br>impressive human capital and natural resources will drive an
<br>eventual rebound. Argentina's debt levels are manageable,
<br>its return on capital high, and it enjoys several strong
<br>sectors (agriculture, mining, high tech) as well as a
<br>relatively competitive industrial sector and decent market
<br>size. This means that if the Kirchners make it to the middle
<br>of next year, with the external environment improving and
<br>some attractive presidential candidates in the mix for the
<br>2011 race, the proximity of the post-Kirchner era may by
<br>itself reverse capital inflows and jump-start a robust
<br>recovery -- which paradoxically could significantly reduce
<br>the chances that CFK will be removed from office prematurely.
<br>
<br>
<br>A Word on the Psychological Theory
<br>----------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶25. (C/NF) As for the argument that the ruling couple's
<br>precarious psyches will lead to their fall from power,
<br>suffice it to say that this argument is highly speculative
<br>and anecdotal. Few people maintain that the president and
<br>her husband, both well into their fifties, have changed much
<br>over the past two years. As Fraga notes, it is Argentina
<br>that has changed, not them. That seems like a good (partial)
<br>explanation for why the Kirchners fared poorly and misplayed
<br>their hand in the mid-terms, but it does not necessarily mean
<br>that it will prevent CFK from reaching the end of her term.
<br>After all, the Kirchners have been abrasive, impervious to
<br>outside advice, and even paranoid through more than six years
<br>of presidential power, and they're still in the Casa Rosada.
<br>As long as the political establishment remains focused on the
<br>next presidential race and the economy doesn't suffer a
<br>meltdown, we expect that's where the Kirchners will stay
<br>until December 2011.
