<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: The Socialist Workers Party of Spain
<br>(PSOE), surprise victor in March 14 elections, is a
<br>center-left party in the European social democrat tradition.
<br>Since the end of the Franco regime and the beginning of
<br>Spain's modern democracy in 1977, PSOE has generally
<br>advocated comprehensive social programs and limited defense
<br>spending, as well as a reduced domestic role for the armed
<br>forces. In practical terms, members of Zapatero's inner
<br>circle have been careful to say PSOE will make no significant
<br>changes to the Aznar government's successful economic
<br>policies. We expect static or reduced defense spending under
<br>PSOE, increased social welfare programs, more "green"
<br>environment policies, a greater focus on Spain's role in the
<br>EU (including increased adherence to French and German
<br>leadership), and distancing from the Spain's close
<br>relationship with the United States that Aznar fostered. End
<br>summary.

<br>Mainstream Socialists
<br>---------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) Founded more than 120 years ago, the PSOE espouses
<br>as its main goals liberty, equality, solidarity and social
<br>justice. Communists broke with the Socialists after the 1917
<br>Russian revolution and formed their own party (now the United
<br>Left, or IU). PSOE renounced any connection with Marxism in
<br>1979, reaffirming the democratic and federal nature of the
<br>party. Since the end of the Franco regime and the beginning
<br>of modern Spanish democracy in 1977, PSOE has advocated
<br>comprehensive social programs, limited defense spending and a
<br>reduced role for the military in Spanish life.
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) The Socialists governed Spain with Felipe Gonzalez
<br>as President from 1982-1996. Though the Socialists lost power
<br>in 1996 amidst a swirl of corruption scandals, Gonzalez is
<br>credited with having strengthened the foundations of Spanish
<br>democracy and governmental institutions during his time as
<br>head of government. Spain joined the European Community and,
<br>in a national referendum, reaffirmed its membership in NATO
<br>under Gonzalez, a position PSOE had originally opposed.
<br>Gonzalez called the latter a "triumph of the people of
<br>Spain." The Socialist government under Gonzalez also updated
<br>Spain's agreement with the United States for American use of
<br>Spanish military bases.
<br>
<br>---------------
<br>Zapatero's PSOE
<br>---------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) President-elect Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero took
<br>over as PSOE's secretary general in 2000, narrowly edging out
<br>party "baron" Jose Bono. In 2003 the party issued a
<br>resolution outlining its political program designed "to
<br>increase freedom and the decision-making power of ordinary
<br>citizens over their own lives; to reduce crime; to allow
<br>citizens to develop their talents and abilities to the
<br>fullest; and to ensure individuals are not abandoned to their
<br>own fate." Following is a summary of PSOE positions in major
<br>issue areas:
<br>
<br>-- Foreign Policy: See Ref A for a discussion of PSOE's
<br>likely foreign policy goals. PSOE's general foreign policy
<br>outlook was summarized well by Manuel Marin, the party's
<br>international affairs spokesman in Congress: "Aznar wanted
<br>to make Spain a great nation among the great nations, but
<br>Spain lacks the means and capacity for that role. Spain
<br>cannot be a determinative force in great international
<br>conflicts. We do not have the political or economic weight
<br>for that, nor the internal security and defense capabilities
<br>that would be necessary." In general, we expect PSOE to
<br>conduct more of its foreign policy via Brussels and to hew
<br>closer to Franco-German positions. Zapatero's comments have
<br>also indicated he plans to distance Spain from the close
<br>relations the U.S. enjoyed under the Aznar government.
<br>
<br>-- Economy: The outlines of PSOE's economic platform are in
<br>Ref C. Close associates of Zapatero have been careful to say
<br>that the incoming PSOE government will not make significant
<br>changes to the PP's successful economic policies. Some
<br>business leaders have voiced the same expectations with us.
<br>PSOE will work to decrease unemployment (currently over 11
<br>percent and one of the highest in the EU) and convert jobs on
<br>temporary contracts (currently one-third of new jobs created)
<br>into permanent positions which carry full benefits.
<br>President-elect Zapatero has stated his government will focus
<br>significant attention on calming the rapid rise in housing
<br>prices and has already announced the creation of a Ministry
<br>of Housing. The PSOE also advocates more investment in R&D
<br>and training for workers. They have promised to simplify the
<br>tax system, resulting in decreased taxes for many Spaniards,
<br>while maintaining a balanced budget and fiscal discipline.
<br>
<br>-- Social Programs and Issues: PSOE has pledged to: include
<br>more health services in the nation's health plan and reduce
<br>the maximum wait time for operations; increase pensions and
<br>improve health care for the aged; raise the minimum wage;
<br>lengthen legally mandated paternity leave; change the civil
<br>code to allow gay marriages; mandate gender-based affirmative
<br>action for government jobs; and devote more attention to the
<br>problem of domestic violence.
<br>
<br>-- Education: Zapatero has said PSOE will lengthen the
<br>school day, increase bilingual education (one-third of
<br>classes will be taught in English), improve computer access,
<br>and increase grants for students who go on to higher
<br>education.
<br>
<br>-- Environment: We can anticipate more "green" environment
<br>policies. PSOE officials have made clear they plan to scrap
<br>the PP's hugely controversial north-south water transfer
<br>plan, replacing it with a new water policy to be based on
<br>better water management, increased reliance on underground
<br>water supplies and greater investment in desalination. PSOE
<br>has pledged Spain's complete compliance with the Kyoto
<br>Protocol, despite rumblings from Spanish industry that
<br>emissions cuts agreed under the EU umbrella will severely and
<br>negatively affect competitiveness. PSOE's campaign platform
<br>called for a formal moratorium on nuclear power within five
<br>years, but recent pronouncements have indicated that the
<br>party might simply deny renewal of current licenses.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Zapatero has not explained how he plans to pay for
<br>increased social programs while cutting taxes at the same
<br>time, except to suggest he may trim defense spending to pay
<br>part of the bill. His inner circle have suggested some
<br>revenues may come through greater government efficiencies,
<br>without specifying programs or jobs that would be eliminated.
<br>
<br>-------
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) PSOE is a mainstream European socialist party.
<br>Although Zapatero has led PSOE for four years, he has never
<br>held a government position, and since PSOE has been out of
<br>power for eight years, neither have many of those around him
<br>(see Ref B for a discussion those surrounding Zapatero).
<br>PSOE and Zapatero will have a steep learning curve to climb
<br>upon taking power. Given the need to appeal to his large
<br>anti-war constituency, Zapatero will distance Spanish foreign
<br>policy from Aznar's close relations with the U.S.
<br>Nonetheless, we are hopeful that once PSOE grasps that it has
<br>won and Zapatero is in office, Zapatero will come to realize
<br>that while he may have differences with the U.S., it is still
<br>in Spain's interest to cooperate with us on a number of
<br>issues.
