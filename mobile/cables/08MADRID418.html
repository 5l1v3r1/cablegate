<br>TAGS: EFIN IR KTFN SP
<br>SUBJECT: BANCO SABADELL SUSPENDS IRAN REPRESENTATIONAL
<br>OFFICE AFTER TREASURY, POST ENGAGEMENT
<br>
<br>REF: A. MADRID 308
<br>¶B. MADRID 286
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre for Reasons 1.4(d) and (e)
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) On April 14, post received a letter from Banco
<br>Sabadell President Jose Oliu announcing that Sabadell had
<br>decided on March 31 to suspend all activities of its Iran
<br>representational office. Para 3 contains an informal
<br>translation of the letter, which responded to a letter post
<br>had sent Oliu the previous week containing information from
<br>Treasury about certain Iranian banks.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Comment: The suspension follows active USG engagement
<br>on the issue. Ref B reported visiting Treasury Deputy
<br>Secretary Kimmitt's March 6 conversation with Oliu about
<br>
<br>SIPDIS
<br>Iran. It also reported that the Central Bank had discussed
<br>Iran with Sabadell after the Deputy Secretary's Central Bank
<br>meeting the previous day. Ref A contains information
<br>provided at that time by Sabadell to the Central Bank about
<br>its ties with Iran. Sabadell later provided additional
<br>information (emailed to Treasury) about its ties to Iran as a
<br>result of post's followup inquiries. End Comment.
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) Informal translation of text of letter:
<br>
<br>Having received your letter this past April 8 via fax, I
<br>would like to ask you to pass on my appreciation to Deputy
<br>Secretary of the Treasury Robert Kimmitt for the information
<br>
<br>SIPDIS
<br>submitted.
<br>
<br>As we had the opportunity to discuss, Banco Sabadell has
<br>followed to the letter all of the designations that the UN,
<br>the European Union, the (FATF), and the U.S. have been
<br>establishing in the field of terrorism. In following them,
<br>the bank has also implemented all the controls and
<br>precautions necessary for compliance: cancellation of
<br>operations with persons and entities included in the
<br>published lists, among others Bank Melli and Bank Mellat in
<br>which we blocked their operations as of the beginning of the
<br>last quarter of 2007, additionally, establishment of
<br>reinforced controls of our knowledge of clients, special
<br>monitoring of operations with Iran, to the point of limiting
<br>operations to transactions with only those Banco Sabadell
<br>clients who were extremely well-known and that (Note: the
<br>transactions) were subjected to special scrutiny in terms of
<br>the Iranian party, knowledge of the commercial relations and
<br>the affected goods.
<br>
<br>In addition to the above, I request that you inform Mr.
<br>Kimmitt that on March 31, Banco Sabadell decided to suspend
<br>all activities of the Iran representational office, and as a
<br>consequence, any transaction or operation with the Iranian
<br>banking system (maintaining open only those obligations
<br>previously contracted by Banco Sabadell, which once expired
<br>will not be renewed). To this effect, all of the SWIFT codes
<br>and correspondent accounts with Iranian financial entities
<br>have been annulled, thereby blocking the emission and receipt
<br>of transfers.
<br>
<br>I remain at your service and take this opportunity to send
<br>you my attentive regards,
<br>
<br>Jose Oliu Creus
<br>President
<br>Banco Sabadell
<br>AGUIRRE<br>
