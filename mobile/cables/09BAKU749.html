<br>
<br>Classified By: Charge Donald Lu, Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) Summary:  Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev
<br>utilizes distinctly different approaches to foreign and
<br>domestic policies.  He typically devises the former with
<br>pragmatism, restraint and a helpful bias toward integration
<br>with the West, yet at home his policies have become
<br>increasingly authoritarian and hostile to diversity of
<br>political views.  This divergence of approaches, combined
<br>with his father's continuing omnipresence, has led some
<br>observers to compare the Aliyevs with the fictional
<br>"Corleones" of Godfather fame, with the current president
<br>described alternately as a mix of "Michael" and "Sonny."
<br>Either way, this Michael/Sonny dichotomy complicates our
<br>approach to Baku and has the unfortunate effect of framing
<br>what should be a strategically valuable relationship as a
<br>choice between U.S. interests and U.S. values.  End Summary.
<br>
<br>¶2.  (S/NF) This striking aspect of President Ilham Aliyev's
<br>governing style was very neatly summed up recently by the
<br>witty, but somewhat past-his-prime XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX (protect).  Commenting
<br>on the GOAJ's harsh reaction to the YouTube "donkey video"
<br>(Reftel A), XXXXXXXXXXXX quipped to the Charge that what one must
<br>understand about Aliyev, "He's not Michael Corleone, he's
<br>Sonny."  To some in Baku, XXXXXXXXXXXX Godfather analogy seems
<br>apt - capturing essential truths not only about Ilham Aliyev,
<br>but his father Heydar, who becomes by implication the "Vito
<br>Corleone" of Azerbaijan.  With that in mind, this cable
<br>attempts to explain who Ilham Aliyev is and why he does what
<br>h does.  Aside from XXXXXXXXXXXX analogy, it also owe much to
<br>the appraisals of Michael and Sonny from "The Godfather
<br>Doctrine (2008)," by John Hulsman and A. Wess Mitchell.
<br>
<br>"That's my family, Kay.  It's not me."
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶3.  (C) Ilham Aliyev inherited a newly independent,
<br>resource-rich state, brought to order in the post-Soviet era
<br>by this father, Heydar Aliyev, scarred by a catastrophic war
<br>with Armenia that resulted in occupation of the
<br>Nagorno-Karabakh enclave and seven surrounding Azerbaijani
<br>regions.  He assumed the presidency in 2003, concurrent with
<br>his father's death, in an election marked by a lack of
<br>competition and debate, at a time when Azerbaijan's
<br>re-developed oil and gas resources were being brought on line
<br>for export.  Dogged by widespread doubts about his
<br>suitability for leadership based on his age (then 41), lack
<br>of achievements and a "playboy" image, he oversaw the launch
<br>of a one million-barrels-per-day oil pipeline, which has
<br>flooded official and unofficial coffers in Baku and serves as
<br>the financial backbone of the country.
<br>
<br>¶4.  (C) The President and his cohorts, who largely were
<br>carried over from his father's administration, now seek
<br>predictability, stability and continuity to preserve and
<br>protect public and private fortunes.  Ilham Aliyev's
<br>landslide 2008 re-election was followed by a hastily-called
<br>March 2009 referendum, which among other things removed term
<br>limits for the President.  Aliyev's cabinet has changed very
<br>little over the years, with few "reformers" brought in or
<br>remaining in power.  The Prime Minister position is largely
<br>ceremonial and weak.  Because of family connections, dynastic
<br>succession, the strong arming of the opposition and the
<br>creation of an elaborate patronage/protection network, the
<br>Aliyev Administration has developed an "organized crime"
<br>image in some quarters, leading some analysts to see Ilham
<br>Aliyev at times in a mafia-like role.
<br>
<br>"Never hate your enemies.  It affects your judgment."
<br>
<br>BAKU 00000749  002 OF 004
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------
<br>
<br>¶5.  (C) In their short study "The Godfather Doctrine,"
<br>Hulsman and Mitchell present brothers Sonny and Michael
<br>Corleone from "The Godfather" as exemplars of two out of
<br>three schools of U.S. foreign policy thought (with
<br>consigliere Tom Hagen representing the third.)  However,
<br>there are important points they raise about the two that
<br>apply well to Aliyev and his policies abroad and at home.
<br>Michael, they write, is a talented balancer of alliances,
<br>aware of limitations on his own power who, importantly, knows
<br>when something isn't personal, but only business.  Sonny, by
<br>contrast, is brash, impulsive, and puts blind faith in force
<br>to address affronts to the Corleone family.  For him,
<br>business is personal.  Finally, Sonny refuses to contemplate
<br>a present or a future in which the Corleone family does not
<br>dominate New York, despite obvious and growing portents to
<br>the contrary.
<br>
<br>"This is business, not personal" - Balanced Foreign Policy
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------------
<br>
<br>¶6.  (S) President Aliyev inherited from his father a clever,
<br>realistic foreign policy that he has largely maintained.
<br>With the overarching goal of maintaining and increasing
<br>Azerbaijan's independence and sovereignty, he encourages
<br>involvement with NATO and Euro-Atlantic security and
<br>political structures and supports a policy of westward
<br>transit of Azerbaijani oil and gas through non-Russian
<br>channels.  Otherwise, though, he alternates between
<br>assertiveness and appeasement where his powerful neighbors
<br>Russia and Iran are concerned.  For example, Azerbaijan
<br>routinely accuses Russia of supplying Armenia with weapons
<br>and pointedly absents itself from the Collective Security
<br>Treaty Organization (CSTO), while participating in GUAM.  At
<br>the same time, Aliyev constantly plays up his relations with
<br>President Medvedev with frequent visits and has kept open the
<br>channels of negotiation on energy issues, concluding a small
<br>but symbolically important agreement with Gazprom to supply
<br>gas to Dagestan (Reftel B).  He is assertive enough to defend
<br>Azerbaijan's prerogative for an independent policy, but
<br>discreet enough that he is in no danger of joining
<br>Saakashvili on Moscow's hit list.
<br>
<br>¶7.  (S) In foreign policy, Aliyev has also been able to
<br>maintain generally the distinction between "business and
<br>personal."  For all his bluster about Azerbaijan's legal
<br>right to liberate the Armenian-occupied territories by force,
<br>Aliyev has worked constructively on the Minsk Group-proposed
<br>Basic Principles and developed a reportedly good rapport with
<br>Armenian President Sargsian - in contrast to the much more
<br>confrontational relationship between the countries' foreign
<br>ministers.  Similarly, even as Aliyev regards with horror the
<br>prospect of Turkey-Armenia rapprochement ahead of
<br>Nagorno-Karabakh resolution, the President has instructed
<br>SOCAR to continue gas transit and supply talks with Turkey,
<br>and no one in Baku has dared to consider a cut in oil exports
<br>through the BTC pipeline.  The gas transit talks are a
<br>hardball affair to be sure, but Aliyev surely recognizes that
<br>Azerbaijan cannot really afford a total rupture with Turkey
<br>and certainly is not going to go so far as to foreclose on
<br>options out of pique while the Turkey-Armenia question
<br>remains open.
<br>
<br>"You touch my sister again and I'll kill you." - The Hardliner
<br>--------------------------------------------- -----------------
<br>
<br>¶8.  (S) For all of the cool-headed calculation that generally
<br>influences Aliyev's foreign policy, his domestic policies are
<br>another matter.  As Aliyev perceives a challenge to his
<br>authority or affronts to his family dignity, even minor ones,
<br>he and his inner circle are apt to react (or overreact), much
<br>to the detriment of the country's democratic development and
<br>movement toward Western alliances.  The example of the crude
<br>retaliation against the young bloggers Emin Milli and Adnan
<br>Hajizade is the most recent and public example (Reftel A).
<br>Earlier, defending his decision to rescind licenses for
<br>foreign broadcasters, Aliyev expressed his anger that Radio
<br>
<br>BAKU 00000749  003 OF 004
<br>
<br>Liberty had mocked his plan to build the world's tallest
<br>flagpole in the Baku port area, demonstrating exceedingly
<br>thin skin (Reftel C).
<br>
<br>¶9.  (S/NF) It is examples like these that inspired XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>quip to the Charge about Sonny and Michael.  XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>elaborated on the point in that conversation, recalling times
<br>when he was an XXXXXXXXXXXX and similar
<br>situations arose.  Heydar would never have allowed himself to
<br>be goaded into ridiculous reactions, he said.  (Note:
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX memory on this might be a little selective, but he
<br>has a point that the space for opinion was wider under the
<br>last President, a view often echoed by journalists who look
<br>back to the 1990s nostalgically.  End Note.)  Ilham Aliyev,
<br>in XXXXXXXXXXXX view, is not inclined to subtlety or
<br>deliberation in his response to these kinds of issues.
<br>
<br>"I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out.  Just my enemies."Q----------------------------------- --------------------------
<br>
<br>¶10.  (S) Aliyev takes the actions he does in order to
<br>eliminate even the semblance of risk to his political
<br>prominence.  His goal appears to be a political environment
<br>in which the Aliyev dynasty is unchallenged, which was
<br>demonstrated by the hastily organized March 2009
<br>constitutional referendum removing presidential term limits.
<br>This strangled the hopes of any and all pretenders to
<br>succession, including his wife (who in Azeri politics is
<br>thought of as a rival Pashayev, not an Aliyev).
<br>
<br>¶11.  (S) The dissonance between Aliyev's sensible approach to
<br>foreign affairs, manifested by the cosmopolitan image he
<br>presents to Western visitors, with his tailored suits and
<br>flawless English, and the unpleasant reality of his approach
<br>to domestic issues raises the obvious question of how these
<br>two realities coexist.  One explanation is that Aliyev is
<br>insecure in domestic politics and relies heavily on the
<br>advice of old-line Soviet-style political figures carried
<br>forward from his father's administration, such as
<br>Presidential Chief of Staff Ramiz Mehdiyev.  Alternatively,
<br>Aliyev's domestic actions are free choices made in accordance
<br>with his instincts, with Mehdiyev and others playing the
<br>"heavy.".
<br>
<br>¶12.  (S) Occasionally, Aliyev's confident tough-guy image
<br>gives way to an impression that he is yielding on domestic
<br>issues.  Outside pressure does not always fail.  A recent
<br>positive example was the outcome of the parliament's
<br>initiative to ram through a Russian-style law on NGOs.  In
<br>the face of a domestic outcry - including from
<br>government-supported NGOs, the Presidential Administration
<br>intervened to prevent the law as drafted from passing (Reftel
<br>D).  Likewise, the President recently rejected a bill from
<br>parliament that would have required foreign-based entities to
<br>hire vetted Azerbaijanis citizens as deputy directors.  The
<br>business community strongly opposed this bill (Reftel E).
<br>Also, the government earlier this year released one of the
<br>prominent journalists whose imprisonment was widely believed
<br>to have been politically motivated (Reftel F).
<br>
<br>"Keep your friends close and your enemies closer."
<br>--------------------------------------------- -----
<br>
<br>¶13.  (S) Comment:  It is clear that Azerbaijan's future
<br>development would better suit United States policy goals if
<br>Aliyev pursued his domestic policies in a manner that
<br>resembled his foreign policy methods, however imperfect they
<br>may be.  A full-scale democratic conversion, however, is an
<br>unlikely outcome, and the record of presidents in this region
<br>leaving office voluntarily is rather thin.  What is desirable
<br>and perhaps achievable, however, is that Aliyev would govern
<br>as a manager of alliances, viewing the political space
<br>occupied by dissents as a source of ideas and a warning
<br>system for when policies are hurting the national interest;
<br>and ceasing to feel that he should strike hard at every
<br>criticism that arises, or that he can do so without
<br>consequences.  At least this type of evolution would better
<br>prepare Azerbaijan for the post-Ilham Aliyev era, whenever
<br>
<br>BAKU 00000749  004 OF 004
<br>
<br>that begins.
<br>
<br>¶14.  (S) Comment Continued:  Here is where the Godfather
<br>analogy begins to break down.  In Azerbaijan the role of
<br>loyal consigliere to the father and the son is played by the
<br>long-time head of Presidential Administration Ramiz Mehdiyev.
<br>Mehdiyev is no calm, conciliating Tom Hagen.  We do not know
<br>if President Aliyev personally ordered the many iron-fisted
<br>domestic initiatives, although he almost certainly approved
<br>them, even if after-the-fact.  We do see Mehdiyev's
<br>fingerprints all over the arrests of journalists, the
<br>stifling of opposition leaders, the closure of mosques, the
<br>restrictions on the media and the general law-and-order
<br>approach to governance.  Is he the puppet or the
<br>puppet-master?  At age 71 and often seen in frail health,
<br>this is an increasingly important question.  While the rule
<br>of 47-year old Ilham Aliyev could continue for decades, it
<br>would be most likely without the benefit of his consigliere.
<br>Without Mehdiyev, it is not clear whom Aliyev will turn to
<br>for help in maintaining the same firm grip on the instruments
<br>of power.
<br>
<br>¶15.  (U) "Don Corleone, I need a man with powerful friends .
<br>. . I need all of those policians you carry around in your
<br>pocket, like so many nickels and dimes."
