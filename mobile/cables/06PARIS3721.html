<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary and comment: Pierre Moscovici, the Socialist 
<br>Party's National Secretary for International Relations, met 
<br>May 29 with visiting Ambassador to NATO Nuland to discuss 
<br>transatlantic relations in the context of France's 2007 
<br>presidential elections. Moscovici insisted that a PS 
<br>Administration -- under a candidate yet to be selected -- 
<br>would be more U.S.-friendly than Chirac, notwithstanding the 
<br>greater emphasis the PS would place on "Europeanizing" French 
<br>foreign policy. France and the U.S. should strive for 
<br>agreement whenever possible, he asserted, even if France can 
<br>never be like the UK -- what he described as "neither Chirac 
<br>nor Blair" -- and should continue talking even when they 
<br>don't agree. He welcomed the warming in transatlantic 
<br>relations since President Bush's visit to Brussels in 2005 
<br>but insisted that divisions between the U.S. and Europe would 
<br>remain, given continuing French concerns about U.S. 
<br>"unilateralist tendencies." The meeting sent a useful signal 
<br>that the U.S. is eager to engage both sides of the political 
<br>aisle on NATO issues, even if Moscovici tended to see the 
<br>transatlantic relationship in terms of the U.S. and the EU. 
<br>End summary and comment. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) In a May 29 meeting with visiting Ambassador to NATO 
<br>Victoria Nuland, Socialist Party (PS) National Secretary for 
<br>International Affairs Pierre Moscovici discussed the likely 
<br>positions of a PS administration on transatlantic relations 
<br>if the Socialist candidate wins the 2007 presidential 
<br>elections, while making clear that he could not speak 
<br>authoritatively for the eventual PS presidential candidate. 
<br>Acknowledging at the outset that he was personally close to 
<br>former Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Moscovici 
<br>described the candidate selection in November -- to be 
<br>determined through a vote among the party's rank and file -- 
<br>as a contest between a popular front-runner (Segolene Royal), 
<br>an outsider (former prime minister Lionel Jospin) and two 
<br>insiders (in particular Strauss-Kahn and former Prime 
<br>Minister Laurent Fabius). Moscovici judged that the PS had a 
<br>50-50 chance of winning the elections. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Moscovici noted the first anniversary of France's 
<br>rejection of the EU constitutional treaty. While he rejected 
<br>the notion that the French "no" was the cause of the current 
<br>crisis in Europe, it had nonetheless deepened an already 
<br>existing crisis. He did not expect a renegotiation of the 
<br>treaty until after the 2007 elections, explaining that 
<br>President Chirac's lame-duck status and damaged credibility 
<br>precluded meaningful initiatives in the interim. Moscovici 
<br>attributed French unease with EU enlargement as perhaps the 
<br>major factor in the treaty's rejection, saying that 
<br>enlargement had proceeded too quickly and without sufficient 
<br>debate. Even if one argued that enlargement was "good," it 
<br>could not substitute for the absence of a tangible "project." 
<br>As a vice-president in the European Parliament, he felt he 
<br>could nonetheless state with relative certainty that Romania 
<br>and Bulgaria would join the EU in 2007, although this would 
<br>not occur without some difficult debate. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Turning to U.S.-EU relations, Moscovici regretted 
<br>what he called a wrong U.S. decision to invade Iraq, but he 
<br>welcomed the U.S. stress on renewed partnership since 2005. 
<br>That said, he believed that "unilateral" strains in U.S. 
<br>thinking, combined with divisiveness among the Europeans, 
<br>meant that some frictions in the transatlantic relationship 
<br>would continue. The EU was more regionally focused, he 
<br>judged, as compared with the more global vision of the U.S. 
<br>All that said, it was important for all to understand that 
<br>the U.S. and Europe had no better allies than each other, so 
<br>it was important to make the best of the relationship. There 
<br>was no other real choice. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Moscovici asserted that the PS leadership was 
<br>favorably disposed toward the U.S. and described the PS as 
<br>ultimately less anti-American than Chirac. While it was 
<br>likely to be tougher on questions of principle, he judged 
<br>that the PS would be more flexible in practice. He described 
<br>Chirac as a dogmatist who had pandered too much to domestic 
<br>opinion, and accused Chirac of actively working against the 
<br>U.S. in the run-up to the Iraq war and threatening a veto 
<br>"too early," before the UN had had an opportunity to explore 
<br>all possible avenues. Although the PS was also opposed to 
<br>the Iraq war, he contended that, unlike Chirac, it also would 
<br>not have broken off dialogue with the U.S. Moscovici claimed 
<br>that, historically, French-U.S. relations had been strongest 
<br>when the left was in power, primarily because the PS did not 
<br>hold certain negative attitudes toward the U.S. The PS, he 
<br>said, would base its relations with the U.S. on cool-headed 
<br>analysis rather than emotion, taking into account the bedrock 
<br>values the Europe and America share.

<br>
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Moscovici asserted that France under a PS 
<br>administration would be "neither Blair nor Chirac." France 
<br>viewed itself as fully European, and, unlike the UK, not as a 
<br>bridge between the U.S. and Europe. But it was incumbent on 
<br>the U.S. and France despite certain differences to maintain 
<br>at all times a constructive dialogue. They should strive to 
<br>find agreement whenever possible, he continued, citing 
<br>specifically Darfur, Iran, Afghanistan, and Kosovo, as well 
<br>as France's membership in NATO. Of course, France would 
<br>sometimes oppose U.S. policy, such as on Iraq. Even then, 
<br>however, it would be important to keep talking, without lies 
<br>and dissimulation. The U.S. should also understand that a PS 
<br>administration would want more than the center-right to 
<br>"Europeanize" France's foreign policy. While proud of 
<br>France's status as a UNSC permanent member, the PS understood 
<br>that it could not act on its own and therefore needed ESDP. 
<br>In that regard, speaking personally, Moscovici said he hoped 
<br>France would not only maintain, but increase current defense 
<br>expenditure levels. Ambassador Nuland welcomed French 
<br>leadership in that regard, adding that Europe also needed 
<br>French leadership. She urged Moscovici to view NATO not as a 
<br>U.S.-owned vehicle, but one in which France was also a large 
<br>stakeholder. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Asked about the weight of security policy issues in 
<br>the upcoming elections, Moscovici said that French voters 
<br>were more motivated by domestic concerns. He noted that that 
<br>U.S. emphasis on anti-terrorism was not shared by the French 
<br>public, which did not view itself as a target. Moreover, 
<br>there was currently great skepticism toward the EU as well as 
<br>the U.S., whereby PS voters were generally much more negative 
<br>than the party leadership and would need to be led toward 
<br>more positive attitudes toward the EU and the U.S. Moscovici 
<br>assured Ambassador Nuland that all the main Socialist 
<br>candidates -- Jospin, Strauss-Kahn, and even former Culture 
<br>Minister Jack Lang -- were reasonable and realistic on this 
<br>count. He indicated, however, that he could not speak for 
<br>Segolene Royal, given that her positions on the issues were 
<br>still largely unknown. (Comment: Moscovici is not a 
<br>Segolene Royal supporter. End comment.) 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Ambassador Nuland concluded the meeting by extending 
<br>an invitation to the PS presidential candidate's foreign 
<br>policy advisor to visit Brussels and become more personally 
<br>familiar with NATO. Moscovici pledged to remain in touch, 
<br>cautioning that an election team probably would not be formed 
<br>until the end of the year, after the selection of the party's 
<br>candidate. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Comment: In discussing transatlantic relations, 
<br>Moscovici tended to speak in terms of the U.S. and the 
<br>Europe. The meeting nonetheless served a useful purpose in 
<br>sensitizing PS officials to NATO issues and, through 
<br>Ambassador Nuland's active pursuit of a meeting with party 
<br>officials on both sides of the aisle, demonstrated U.S. 
<br>willingness to engage them on NATO in the run-up to the 
<br>presidential elections and beyond. End comment. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (U) This message was cleared by Ambassador Nuland.
