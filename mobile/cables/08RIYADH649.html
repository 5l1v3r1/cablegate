<br> 
<br>¶1. (S) Summary: US Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker and 
<br>General David Petraeus met with Saudi King Abdullah bin Abd 
<br>al-Aziz, Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal, General 
<br>Presidency of Intelligence Chief Prince Muqrin bin Abd 
<br>al-Aziz, and Interior Minister Nayif bin Abd al-Aziz during 
<br>their April 14-15 visit to Riyadh.  The Saudi King and senior 
<br>Princes reviewed Saudi policy toward Iraq in detail, all 
<br>making essentially the same points.  They said that the 
<br>Kingdom will not send an ambassador to Baghdad or open an 
<br>embassy until the King and senior Saudi officials are 
<br>satisfied that the security situation has improved and the 
<br>Iraqi government has implemented policies that benefit all 
<br>Iraqis, reinforce Iraq's Arab identity, and resist Iranian 
<br>influence.  The Saudis evinced somewhat greater flexibility 
<br>regarding the issues of economic and humanitarian assistance 
<br>for Iraq and debt forgiveness.  In a conversation with the 
<br>Charge' on April 17, Saudi Ambassador to the US Adel 
<br>al-Jubeir indicated that the King had been very impressed by 
<br>the visit of Ambassador Crocker and General Petraeus, and 
<br>al-Jubeir hinted that the Saudi government might announce 
<br>changes to its Iraq policy before the President's visit to 
<br>Riyadh in mid-May.  End Summary. 
<br> 
<br>Positive Signs in Iraq 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S) In all their meetings with the Saudi royals, both 
<br>Ambassador Crocker and General Petraeus conveyed the progress 
<br>in Iraq and confirmed the negative role Iran is playing in 
<br>Iraq.  They characterized the recent ISF-led operations in 
<br>Basra and Baghdad as having a striking effect against the 
<br>Shia militias, most importantly turning Iraqi public opinion 
<br>away from the militias.  While Prime Minister Nuri 
<br>al-Maliki's decision to take action against the militias was 
<br>described as hasty and not well-planned, Ambassador Crocker 
<br>and General Petraeus emphasized that any tactical shortfalls 
<br>were overshadowed by the greater positive effect of unifying 
<br>Iraq and demonstrating the GOI's, and most specifically 
<br>al-Maliki's, determined resolve to take on the Shia militias, 
<br>especially Jaysh al-Madhi.  Concurrently, these operations 
<br>unequivocally demonstrated Iran's subversive activities in 
<br>Iraq and its broader regional ambitions.  Throughout all 
<br>their discussions, Ambassador Crocker and General Petraeus 
<br>stressed the importance and urgent need for the Saudis to 
<br>join us in supporting Iraq. 
<br> 
<br>The Saudi Embassy Issue 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (S) King Abdullah, the Foreign Minister, and Prince 
<br>Muqrin all stated that the Saudi government would not send an 
<br>ambassador to Baghdad or open an embassy there in the near 
<br>future, citing both security and political grounds in support 
<br>of this position.  The Foreign Minister stated that he had 
<br>considered dispatching an ambassador and had sent Saudi 
<br>diplomats to Baghdad to identify a site for the Saudi 
<br>embassy.  However, he said. "the King simply forbade us to go 
<br>any farther."  King Abdullah confirmed this account in a 
<br>separate meeting with Ambassador Crocker and General 
<br>Petraeus.  The King asserted that the security situation in 
<br>Baghdad was too dangerous for him to risk sending a Saudi 
<br>ambassador there.  "He would immediately become a target for 
<br>the terrorists and the militias," he said. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (S) The King also rejected the suggestion that by sending 
<br>a Saudi ambassador to Baghdad he could give essential 
<br>political support to the Iraqi government as it struggles to 
<br>resist Iranian influence and subversion.  He expressed 
<br>lingering doubt on the Iraqi government's willingness to 
<br>resist Iran.  He also repeated his frequently voiced doubts 
<br>about Iraqi Prime Minister al-Maliki himself by alluding to 
<br>his "Iranian connections."  The Saudi monarch stated that he 
<br>does not trust al-Maliki because the Iraqi Prime Minister had 
<br>"lied" to him in the past by promising to take certain 
<br>actions and then failing to do so.  The King did not say 
<br>precisely what these allegedly broken promises might have 
<br>been.  He repeated his oft heard view that al-Maliki rules 
<br>Iraq on behalf of his Shiite sect instead of all Iraqis. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (S) However, in a potentially significant move, the King 
<br>did not reject the idea of dispatching a Saudi ambassador to 
<br>Baghdad completely.  Instead, he said that he would consider 
<br> 
<br>RIYADH 00000649  002 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>doing so after the Iraqi provincial elections are held in the 
<br>autumn.  The conduct of these elections would indicate 
<br>whether or not the Iraqi government is truly interested in 
<br>ruling on behalf of all Iraqis or merely in support of the 
<br>Shia, King Abdullah asserted. 
<br> 
<br>Grudging Acknowledgment of Change in Iraq 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (S) The Foreign Minister signaled another potential 
<br>softening in Saudi policy by saying that the Kingdom's 
<br>problem was not with al-Maliki as a person but rather with 
<br>the conduct of the Iraqi government.  The King himself 
<br>admitted that the Iraqi government's performance has improved 
<br>in recent months and grudgingly accepted the point that 
<br>al-Maliki and his security forces have indeed been fighting 
<br>extremists, specifically Shia extremists in both Basra and 
<br>Baghdad and Sunni extremists and Al Qaeda in Mosul.  However, 
<br>the King and the senior Princes argued that more time would 
<br>be required to judge whether the recent change in Iraqi 
<br>behavior was lasting and sincere.  The King suggested that 
<br>much of the Iraqi government's improved performance is 
<br>attributable to US prodding rather than change in Iraqi 
<br>attitudes. 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (S) The Foreign Minister also suggested that the USG 
<br>should prod Ayatollah Sistani to speak out in favor of a 
<br>unified Iraq and national reconciliation among different 
<br>Iraqi sects and groups.  "You have paid a heavy price in 
<br>blood and treasure, and Sistani and his people have benefited 
<br>directly.  You have every right to ask this of him," Prince 
<br>Saud al-Faisal said. 
<br> 
<br>Possible Saudi Economic Assistance 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (S) The King, Prince Muqrin, and the Foreign Minister all 
<br>suggested that the Saudi government might be willing to 
<br>consider the provision of economic and humanitarian 
<br>assistance to Iraq. Prince Muqrin asked Ambassador Crocker 
<br>and General Petraeus to send him a list of the kinds of 
<br>assistance that the US government would like to see the 
<br>Kingdom provide Iraq.  Al-Jubeir later told the Charge' that 
<br>this assistance would be separate from the USD 1 billion in 
<br>aid that the Saudi government had promised at the Madrid 
<br>Conference but still not delivered due to security worries. 
<br>He said that the Madrid commitment consisted of $500 million 
<br>in trade credits and $500 million in project assistance with 
<br>strict conditionally, along the lines of what the World Bank 
<br>would require.  Al-Jubeir added that the assistance the Saudi 
<br>government might provide via Prince Muqrin would initially be 
<br>in the range of $75-$300 million. 
<br> 
<br>Possible Debt Relief 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (S) The King noted that Saudi debt relief for Iraq "will 
<br>come at some point," although he did not say when. Al-Jubeir 
<br>told the Charge' that debt relief is a real possibility. He 
<br>also noted that the Saudi government might make changes to 
<br>its Iraq policy, perhaps including both assistance and debt 
<br>relief, prior to the President's visit to Riyadh. 
<br> 
<br>The Need to Resist Iran 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (S) The King, Foreign Minister, Prince Muqrin, and 
<br>Prince Nayif all agreed that the Kingdom needs to cooperate 
<br>with the US on resisting and rolling back Iranian influence 
<br>and subversion in Iraq.  The King was particularly adamant on 
<br>this point, and it was echoed by the senior princes as well. 
<br>Al-Jubeir recalled the King's frequent exhortations to the US 
<br>to attack Iran and so put an end to its nuclear weapons 
<br>program.  "He told you to cut off the head of the snake," he 
<br>recalled to the Charge', adding that working with the US to 
<br>roll back Iranian influence in Iraq is a strategic priority 
<br>for the King and his government. 
<br> 
<br>¶11.  (S) The Foreign Minister, on the other hand, called 
<br>instead for much more severe US and international sanctions 
<br>on Iran, including a travel ban and further restrictions on 
<br>bank lending.  Prince Muqrin echoed these views, emphasizing 
<br>that some sanctions could be implemented without UN approval. 
<br> The Foreign Minister also stated that the use of military 
<br>pressure against Iran should not be ruled out. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>RIYADH 00000649  003 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶12.  (S) Comment: Saudi attitudes toward Iraq, from the King 
<br>on down, remain marked by skepticism and suspicion.  That 
<br>said, the Saudis have noticed recent events in Iraq and are 
<br>eager to work with the US to resist and reverse Iranian 
<br>encroachment in Iraq.  The King was impressed by Ambassador 
<br>Crocker's and General Petraeus' visit, as were the Foreign 
<br>Minister, GPI Chief, and Interior Minister. Cautious as ever, 
<br>the Saudis may nevertheless be willing to consider new 
<br>measures in the areas of assistance and debt relief, although 
<br>further discussions will be required to make these ideas a 
<br>reality.  End Comment. 
<br>¶13.  (U) This cable was reviewed and cleared by Ambassador 
<br>Crocker and General Petraeus.
