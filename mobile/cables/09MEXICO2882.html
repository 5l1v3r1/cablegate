<br>SUBJECT: ELEMENTS OF GOM POLICY TEAM INTERESTED IN FOCUSING 
<br>TOGETHER ON IMPROVING SECURITY IN A FEW KEY CITIES 
<br>
<br>Classified By: NAS Director Keith Mines, reasons 1.5 (b) (d) 
<br>
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: At a dinner hosted by PGR for a visiting DOJ 
<br>delegation, National Security Coordinator Tello Peon and 
<br>Undersecretary for Governance Gutierrez Fernandez told the 
<br>delegation they would like to explore seriously focusing our 
<br>joint efforts on two or three key cities to reverse the 
<br>current wave of violence and instability and show success in 
<br>the fight against the DTOs in the next 18 months. They 
<br>suggested starting in Ciudad Juarez, Tijuana, and one other 
<br>city with a joint planning cell to review what resources we 
<br>could collectively bring to bear. They believe the symbolism 
<br>of turning several of the most violent cities would be 
<br>potent, sending a signal to the rest of the country that the 
<br>fight against organized crime can be won, and combating the 
<br>current sense of impotence felt by many Mexicans. They 
<br>believe it would also go a long way toward stitching up the 
<br>country,s damaged international reputation. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) Acting Attorney General Alcantara hosted a dinner for 
<br>Deputy Attorney General for the Criminal Division Lanny 
<br>Breuer September 21 in Mexico City. Other attendees 
<br>included: 
<br>
<br>GOM 
<br>National Security System Coordinator Jorge Tello Peon 
<br>Undersecretary for Governance (SEGOB) Geronimo Gutierrez 
<br>Fernandez 
<br>PGR DAG (SIEDO) Marisela Morales 
<br>PGR DAG Victor Emilio Corzo Cabanas 
<br>PGR Director for Analysis and Strategic Information Oscar 
<br>Rocha Dobrowski 
<br>
<br>US 
<br>Deputy Assistant AG Bruce Swartz 
<br>Deputy Assistant AG for Criminal Division Kenneth Blanco 
<br>Special Assistant to the AG Paul Rosen 
<br>DOJ Attache Tony Garcia 
<br>NAS Director Keith Mines 
<br>
<br>GOM WANTS FULL TRANSFER OF INTEL TECHNOLOGY AND TRAINING 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Alcantara opened the meeting with two requests from 
<br>Oscar Rocha. First, he said PGR would like to develop a more 
<br>general exchange of intelligence information and capacity, 
<br>not the case-by-case exchange we now have. Second, they 
<br>would like for us to provide a full exchange of technology 
<br>for use in intelligence gathering, not just the loan of 
<br>equipment for specific cases, but the transfer of the 
<br>know-how and training as well. Morales added that the FBI is 
<br>helping to create a cyber-unit in Mexico but it would be 
<br>beneficial if it were expanded and replicated more broadly. 
<br>The SSP, she said, already has a cyber-unit but the real 
<br>mandate rests with PGR-SIEDO. The U.S. side offered that 
<br>there is great capacity in CCIPS in the Criminal Division and 
<br>they would be happy to find ways to offer training and 
<br>capacity building to their Mexican counterparts. We would be 
<br>pleased, Breuer said, in the effort to press High Value 
<br>Targets, to get our Mexican counterparts to the point where 
<br>they can do these things themselves. It will take the 
<br>development of strong trust through proper vetting and good 
<br>training but it would be excellent to get to the point where 
<br>there is no longer impunity for a Chapo Guzman because his 
<br>operating space has been eliminated. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Rocha then spoke of the technological leap about to 
<br>take place in the coming years in the intelligence field. He 
<br>cited the target-finding equipment used by the USMS with 
<br>Mexican counterparts but asked if it would be possible to 
<br>acquire not only such equipment for GOM officials, but also 
<br>the training and full technology transfer that would go with 
<br>it. He suggested we work with vetted units first to provide 
<br>such equipment and training, and then move it out more 
<br>broadly, both to PGR and CISEN. The U.S. side suggested 
<br>getting together in the appropriate working group to see what 
<br>could be done. Rocha reiterated that his intent would be to 
<br>develop indigenous to the PGR all the capacity they currently 
<br>have only in conjunction with the USMS. 
<br>
<br>STRATEGIC MISCALCULATIONS IN MERIDA 
<br>----------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Gutierrez Fernandez then turned to the Merida 
<br>Initiative, saying that in retrospect he and other GOM 
<br>officials realize that not enough strategic thought went into 
<br>Merida in the early phase. There was too much emphasis in 
<br>the initial planning on equipment, which they now know is 
<br>slow to arrive and even slower to be of direct utility in the 
<br>fight against the DTOs. Of more immediate importance is 
<br>building institutions that can effectively use the equipment. 
<br>He was careful to point out that all the equipment is needed 
<br>and will be put to good use, but wishes that there had been a 
<br>more direct focus on institution building, and supported the 
<br>current shift in Merida focus to capacity building and 
<br>creating more effective institutions. 
<br>
<br>"WE HAVE EIGHTEEN MONTHS" 
<br>------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Gutierrez went on to say, however, that he now 
<br>realizes there is not even time for the institution building 
<br>to take hold in the remaining years of the Calderon 
<br>administration. "We have 18 months," he said, "and if we 
<br>do not produce a tangible success that is recognizable to the 
<br>Mexican people, it will be difficult to sustain the 
<br>confrontation into the next administration." He lamented 
<br>the pervasive, debilitating fear that is so much a part of 
<br>contemporary Mexican society, where even people in the 
<br>Yucatan, with "European levels of security" are afraid 
<br>because of the instability in a few distant cities. He 
<br>expressed a real concern with "losing" certain regions. It 
<br>is damaging Mexico's international reputation, hurting 
<br>foreign investment, and leading to a sense of government 
<br>impotence, Gutierrez said. 
<br>
<br>DON,T SHY AWAY FROM THE HARDEST CHALLENGES 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Gutierrez believes what is needed is a clear roadmap 
<br>for the remaining years of security cooperation between the 
<br>U.S. and Mexico under President Calderon that targets a few 
<br>joint projects in a few cities, rather than doing a little of 
<br>everything. Tello Peon agreed, suggesting that there is not 
<br>time for pilot projects, and certainly not time to work in a 
<br>few relatively safe cities such as Nuevo Laredo as has been 
<br>suggested, in order to develop the experience to take on the 
<br>real challenges. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Instead, he believes, we need to confront the cities 
<br>with the largest insecurity and fix them. If we could turn 
<br>around Tijuana, Ciudad Juarez, and one other city such as 
<br>Culiacan, it would solve 60% of the violence, and send a 
<br>signal to the Mexican people that the war can be won. 
<br>Politically, he and Gutierrez said, Mexico must succeed in 
<br>Juarez because Calderon has staked so much of his reputation 
<br>there, with a major show of force that, to date, has not 
<br>panned out. Even if it is not completely solved by the time 
<br>Calderon leaves office, if they can get things moving in the 
<br>right direction, setting the conditions for ultimate success, 
<br>it will be enough. There was a brief &chicken and egg8 
<br>discussion, with one side suggesting that well-placed and 
<br>effective federal forces could push back the DTOs 
<br>sufficiently for the state and local forces to function, 
<br>while others believed that well-functioning state and local 
<br>forces will be a precondition for the federal forces to 
<br>produce stability. 
<br>
<br>MOVING FORWARD TOGETHER 
<br>----------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Gutierrez thought that to start we need a good joint 
<br>assessment of organized criminal groups that makes explicit 
<br>their vulnerabilities. We have, he said, five things to put 
<br>into the fight: resources, training, joint operations, 
<br>technology, and cooperation, and we need to mobilize 
<br>effectively all of them. He especially mentioned the need to 
<br>synchronize our joint efforts, citing the recent show of 
<br>force the U.S. promised on our side of the border that could 
<br>not be matched by anything on the Mexican side, leaving it 
<br>hollow. Tello Peon suggested we form a planning cell, a few 
<br>experts on each side, who could focus on a few programs in a 
<br>few places for the next 2 years. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) In addition to the intelligence and operational 
<br>cooperation that would be at the heart of the new approach, 
<br>Gutierrez and Tello Peon mentioned the importance of cultural 
<br>and political factors. Politically, Mexico may have a 
<br>federal system, Gutierrez said, but historically it has been 
<br>more centralized like Colombia or France. The federal 
<br>government, however, no longer has the ability to manage the 
<br>system from top to bottom. He suggested it would be 
<br>necessary for success to break through the impasse produced 
<br>by Mexico,s currently dysfunctional federal system and 
<br>ensure programs can be synchronized with the states. Tello 
<br>Peon also said there will be a need to work on the cultural 
<br>factors required to produce a &culture of lawfulness8 that 
<br>would mobilize the societal support necessary for success. 
<br>Culture and politics will be very complex, he said, but can 
<br>be made to work. A clearly articulated and strong doctrine 
<br>will help get people behind the strategy. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Tello Peon ended the discussion by saying he arrived 
<br>at the dinner somewhat fatigued but would leave energized. 
<br>He thought it was an excellent mix of people and welcomed the 
<br>honest exchange of new ideas. Mexico, he summarized, is 
<br>committed to staying the course, which is sustainable with a 
<br>few clear successes. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Comment: We will follow up with Tello Peon and 
<br>Gutierrez in the coming weeks to see how committed the GOM is 
<br>to the strategy of selecting a few key cities and working to 
<br>turn security. If it is their strategy and they plan to 
<br>execute it, we should get behind it, using the new strategic 
<br>framework to build a regional program to take on the biggest 
<br>challenges in key border cities. A considerable amount could 
<br>be done with existing funding and a marginal increase in 
<br>staffing. We would use the remainder of the calendar year 
<br>for planning, and have a new series of programs ready to roll 
<br>out in the new year.
