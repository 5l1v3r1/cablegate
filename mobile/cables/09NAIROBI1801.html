<br>SUBJECT: SOMALIA - CODEL MARSHALL SCENESETTER: HOW 
<br>IRAQ/AFGHANISTAN RELATE TO SOMALIA 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Ranneberger for reasons 1.4(b) and 
<br>(d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S//NF) Summary: U.S. Embassy Nairobi warmly welcomes 
<br>CODEL Marshall and looks forward to your September 1-3 visit. 
<br>We note your questions regarding media reports that pressure 
<br>in Iraq/Afghanistan has prompted al-Qa,ida to shift some of 
<br>its operations/efforts to Somalia (ref A). To address this 
<br>question, we have reviewed a body of available information 
<br>from press, embassy, and other reporting. The rise of 
<br>al-Shabaab and the increase in foreign fighters operating in 
<br>Somalia warrants significant concern; several al-Qa,ida 
<br>operatives, most notably Saleh Nabhan, have a history of 
<br>involvement in East Africa and are currently cooperating with 
<br>al-Shabaab leaders and involved in training foreign fighters 
<br>in Somalia. We speculate that, due to pressure especially in 
<br>Afghanistan, al-Qa,ida could consider Somalia a safer 
<br>training ground for foreign fighters, some of whom may intend 
<br>subsequently to travel to Afghanistan or Iraq. However, 
<br>based on a review of foreign fighter trends and 
<br>al-Qa,ida/al-Shabaab operations, we are unable to establish 
<br>a strong correlation between recent military pressure on 
<br>al-Qa,ida in Iraq and Afghanistan and increased al-Qa,ida 
<br>influence/efforts in Somalia. Nonetheless, there is a clear 
<br>threat from al-Qaida linked extremists and growing numbers of 
<br>foreign fighters in Somalia over the past several years, 
<br>which are directly challenging the efforts of the 
<br>Transitional Federal Government (TFG) to establish itself. 
<br>End Summary. 
<br>
<br>Foreign Fighters: Origins and Motivations 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S//NF) Many of the foreign fighters currently operating 
<br>in Somalia, particularly those who entered to fight the 
<br>Ethiopians from 2006-2008, are ethnic Somalis, recruited from 
<br>either neighboring countries or diasporas overseas and 
<br>motivated in the past by a sense of Somali nationalism, 
<br>jihadist propaganda, and the presence of foreign troops in 
<br>the country. As widely covered in the press, this includes 
<br>North Americans, including at least 20 young men who were 
<br>recruited from Minneapolis alone, and recruits from European 
<br>countries with large Somali diasporas. Fighters have also 
<br>come from within East Africa, most notably Kenya and Sudan. 
<br>In addition, press reports and our conversations with Somali 
<br>government officials note the presence of an unknown number 
<br>of non-Somali fighters from South Asia and the Middle East, 
<br>including Pakistanis, Yemenis, and other unidentified 
<br>&Arabs8. We speculate some of these fighters may have 
<br>chosen, or been directed to, Somalia for training and to gain 
<br>jihadist experiences because Somalia currently affords 
<br>comparatively greater safety for camps and other sites than 
<br>South Asia or Iraq. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S//NF) Neither we nor the Somali government knows 
<br>exactly how many foreign fighters are in Somalia, as 
<br>reporting varies widely. Statements by Somali government 
<br>officials mention several thousand foreigners, which we 
<br>believe are exaggerations, or at best estimations based on 
<br>fighter sightings and rumors. During the intense May and 
<br>June fighting in Mogadishu, there were numerous reports of 
<br>foreign fighters interspersed with al-Shabaab, likely 
<br>directed from camps in Southern Somalia as reinforcements. 
<br>Conversations with Somali political leaders, suggest that as 
<br>of mid-August, significant numbers of al-Shabaab forces have 
<br>left Mogadishu and dispersed across southern and central 
<br>regions of Somalia. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S//NF) The timing and motivation of foreign fighters 
<br>arriving in Somalia appears tied to perceptions of internal 
<br>Somali dynamics. Our conversations with Somali political 
<br>leaders highlight that some foreigners were already present 
<br>during the Council of Islamic Courts period, and that the 
<br>Ethiopian intervention in 2006 both prompted some foreigners 
<br>to flee, and provided motivation for a new influx of foreign 
<br>fighters, including ethnic Somalis determined to drive 
<br>Ethiopia out of Somalia. Al-Shabaab,s territorial gains in 
<br>2008, and the subsequent Ethiopian withdrawal from Somalia in 
<br>January 2009, prompted additional foreign fighters to join 
<br>what was seen as a successful struggle. Regardless of their 
<br>initial motivations, these young recruits are subject to 
<br>indoctrination and use by violent, often foreign, extremists, 
<br>
<br>NAIROBI 00001801 002 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>as demonstrated by Shirwa Ahmed, an ethnic Somali from 
<br>Minneapolis who became one of the suicide-bombers 
<br>perpetrating multiple attacks in Puntland and Somaliland on 
<br>October 29, 2009. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S//NF) Al-Qa,ida leaders in early 2009 publicly 
<br>endorsed the Somalia &jihad,8 capitalizing on al-Shabaab,s 
<br>gains by launching a rhetoric campaign designed to encourage 
<br>aspiring jihadis to travel to Somalia, and portraying Somali 
<br>President Sharif as illegitimate. In the first half of 2009, 
<br>Al-Qa'ida issued several videos praising al-Shabaab, 
<br>denouncing President Sharif,s government, and urging 
<br>fighters to travel to Somalia. Most notable among these 
<br>propaganda efforts was a statement attributed to Usama Bin 
<br>Laden titled &Fight on Champions of Somalia,8 and similar 
<br>videos by senior al-Qa,ida leaders, including Aymen 
<br>al-Zawahiri and Abu-Yahya al-Libi(Ref B). 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S//NF) Beyond the public support from al-Qa,ida videos 
<br>encouraging foreign fighters to travel to Somalia, there is 
<br>scant evidence of significant direct al-Qa,ida financial or 
<br>military support for extremists in Somalia, or a foreign 
<br>fighter pipeline from Iraq or Afghanistan. Other support for 
<br>Somali militants, largely in the form of financing and 
<br>smuggled weapons, comes from a variety of sources including 
<br>Eritrea and conduits through Eritrea, diaspora remittances, 
<br>smuggling from Yemen, and likely business donors in the Gulf 
<br>States. These appear to be important external sources of 
<br>support for anti-TFG militants in Somalia. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S//NF) Within Somalia, al-Shabaab,s core leaders 
<br>cooperate with several al-Qa,ida operatives with a long 
<br>history in the region. Most notably, Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, 
<br>who was active during the 2006 Council of Islamic Courts, and 
<br>currently remains in Somalia, has made a concerted effort to 
<br>cooperate with key al-Shabaab leaders, and is actively 
<br>recruiting and training foreign fighters. These senior level 
<br>extremists are long-time operatives in East Africa, rather 
<br>than new arrivals from Iraq or Afghanistan, although the new 
<br>influx of foreign jihadis likely contains individuals with 
<br>agenda's beyond the Somali insurgency. Nabhan, with his 
<br>transnational agenda and involvement in training foreigners, 
<br>makes the situation even more dangerous. 
<br>
<br>Kenyan CT Efforts 
<br>----------------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (S//NF) Kenyan security officials have worked to address 
<br>the threat of terrorism in Kenya, and are aware of the trend 
<br>in foreign fighters and the smuggling of support to 
<br>al-Shabaab, some of which transits Kenya. Kenya fears that 
<br>al-Shabaab will begin conducting cross border attacks, and 
<br>has deployed military forces to positions in eastern and 
<br>northern Kenya near the Somali border. Kenya has attempted to 
<br>close this border, but the consistent flow of Somali refugees 
<br>demonstrates the difficulties inherent to controlling this 
<br>long, porous, and largely unregulated border region. In 
<br>addition, the TFG and the Government of Kenya are secretly 
<br>considering an offensive in the Juba region of Somalia, aimed 
<br>at pushing al-Shabaab out of the key port of Kismayo and 
<br>neighboring areas in Southern Somalia (reftel C). 
<br>
<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶9. (S//NF) While we speculate that al-Qa,ida may consider 
<br>Somalia a relatively safer location for foreign fighter 
<br>training camps, at this point, al-Qa,ida,s efforts to 
<br>&shift8 focus towards Somalia appear to have consisted 
<br>primarily of the aforementioned publicity campaign. There is 
<br>some indication that vigorous effort by the U.S. and the 
<br>Kenyans may have disrupted efforts by al-Qa'ida and the 
<br>al-Shabaab to work more closely together. Even as a degree of 
<br>increased stability in Iraq, and military pressure in 
<br>Afghanistan may have encouraged a small number of foreign 
<br>fighters to choose Somalia as an alternate venue for jihad, 
<br>we lack evidence of significant numbers of fighters 
<br>previously engaged in Iraq and Afghanistan diverting to 
<br>Somalia. Likewise, while there are widespread reports of 
<br>Pakistani and Arab fighters in Somalia, the timing and influx 
<br>of these fighters appear primarily tied to developments in 
<br>Somalia and perceptions of Somalia as a suitable location for 
<br>
<br>NAIROBI 00001801 003 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>jihad. Nevertheless, al-Qa,ida operatives coordinate with 
<br>al-Shabaab,s core leaders, and continue to use Somalia as a 
<br>staging and training base.
