<br>TO CONTROL MUCH OF SOUTH OSSETIA, FIGHTING CONTINUES
<br>
<br>REF: TBILISI 1337
<br>
<br>Classified By: AMBASSADOR JOHN F. TEFFT FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D)
<br>
<br>¶1.  (C)  Summary: President Saakashvili in an August 8
<br>conversation with the Ambassador, and Foreign Minister Eka
<br>Tkeshelashvili in a briefing to the diplomatic corps, claimed
<br>that Georgia now controlled most of South Ossetia, including
<br>Tskhinvali, although fighting was continuing near the
<br>northern town of Dzhava.  They also reported that Russian
<br>aircraft had dropped bombs on several targets in Georgia,
<br>outside of the conflict zone, at two locations in the center
<br>of Gori and dropped ordnance on a radar installation near
<br>Gori and a police station in Kareli.  There are uncofirmed
<br>Georgian claims that they downed a Russian aircraft; in a
<br>statement, the Russian MFA denied this.  Fighting had
<br>continued throughout the night of August 7, resuming four
<br>hours after President Saakashvili unilaterally declared a
<br>cease-fire at 1900.  In a second address August 8, he called
<br>on the international community to help repel this "open
<br>Russian aggression" and announced a general mobilization of
<br>reserves.  Meanwhile, Russian statements have accused the
<br>Georgians of targeting Russian peacekeepers; the Georgians
<br>argue that the South Ossetians are firing on the Russian
<br>peacekeepers as a provocation.  The Georgians have announced
<br>that a safe corridor and ceasefire will be established from 3
<br>to 6 pm local time for all civilians interested in leaving
<br>Tskhinvali to do so.  During the night of August 8, four
<br>short range ballistic missiles were fired from within Russia
<br>toward Tskhinvali.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) We understand that at this point the Georgians control
<br>75 percent of Tskhinvali and 11 villages around it.
<br>Journalists report that Georgian forces are moving toward the
<br>Roki tunnel.  That road has been cratered by Georgian
<br>aircraft to make it difficult.  We are told fighting
<br>continues with Russian fighters north of Tskhinvali; it is
<br>not clear if they are regular army or North Caucasian
<br>irregulars.  Saakashvili has said that Georgia had no
<br>intention of getting into this fight, but was provoked by the
<br>South Ossetians and had to respond to protect Georgian
<br>citizens and territory.  Meanwhile, the Georgian National
<br>Security Council (NSC) has formally requested 1,000 of its
<br>combat troops in Iraq be returned to Georgia within 72 hours.
<br>End Summary.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Comment: All the evidence available to the country
<br>team supports Saakashvili's statement that this fight was not
<br>Georgia's original intention.  Key Georgian officials who
<br>would have had responsibility for an attack on South Ossetia
<br>have been on leave, and the Georgians only began mobilizing
<br>August 7 once the attack was well underway.  As late as 2230
<br>last night Georgian MOD and MFA officials were still hopeful
<br>that the unilateral cease-fire announced by President
<br>Saakashvili would hold.  Only when the South Ossetians opened
<br>up with artillery on Georgian villages, did the offensive to
<br>take Tskhinvali begin.  Post has eyes on the ground at the
<br>Ministry of Interior command post in Tbilisi and will
<br>continue to provide updates.  The Embassy held an EAC and
<br>will hold another to reasses the situation by COB.  We have
<br>issued a warden message and are looking at the situation very
<br>carefully.  If the Georgians are right, and the fighting is
<br>mainly over, the real unknown is what the Russian role will
<br>be and whether there is potential for the conflict to expand.
<br>End comment.
<br>
<br>Current Situation
<br>-----------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C)  Saakashvili, who told the Ambassador that he was in
<br>Gori when a Russian bomb fell in the city center, confirmed
<br>that the Georgians had not decided to move ahead until the
<br>shelling intensified and the Russians were seen to be
<br>amassing forces on the northern side of the Roki Tunnel.  He
<br>said that the Georgian military action had been successful,
<br>Tskhinvali was mainly under Georgian control and that
<br>reservists would be brought in to defend the city while armed
<br>forces were moved further north to continue the fighting.
<br>According to Saakashvili, the EU was sending in Carl Bildt
<br>and the Lithuanian Foreign Minister to Tbilisi.  Although
<br>most in the Georgian government believed that the fighting
<br>had started as a ploy of de facto leader Kokoity, Saakashvili
<br>was now concerned that this might have been a Russian pretext
<br>and a further attack could be expected.  The Foreign Minister
<br>briefed the diplomatic corps on the situation, noting that
<br>"all red lines had been crossed," but expressing hope that
<br>negotiations could take place and noting that a full amnesty
<br>would be offered to anyone involved in the fighting.  She
<br>called on the international community to put pressure on the
<br>Russian Government to take no action.

<br>
<br>¶5. (C) The battle in South Ossetia took place throughout the
<br>night of August 7.   During the night, four short range
<br>ballistic missiles were fired from within Russia toward
<br>Tskhinvali.  On August 8, Russian aircraft flew into Georgian
<br>airspace in central Georgia and dropped ordnance on a radar
<br>installation near Gori and a police station in Kareli.  Post
<br>understands that at this point the Georgians control 75
<br>percent of Tskhinvali and 11 villages around it.  Journalists
<br>report that Georgian forces are moving toward the Roki
<br>tunnel.  That road has been cratered by Georgian aircraft to
<br>make it difficult to navigate with vehicles.  We are told
<br>fighting continues with Russian fighters north of Tskhinvali.
<br>It is not clear if they are regular army or North Caucasian
<br>irregulars, as an MOIA spokesman said that approximately 1500
<br>uniformed, unidentified forces with tanks and artillery
<br>entered South Ossetia via the Roki tunnel on August 8 at
<br>¶0200. Reports indicate many casualties, but none are reliably
<br>accurate.  State Minister of Conflict Settlement and
<br>Reintegration Temuri Yakobashvili said again on August 8 that
<br>Georgia will grant amnesty to all Ossetian fighters.
<br>
<br>Chronology of Events
<br>--------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) On August 7 at 1925 Yakobashvili returned from the
<br>conflict zone and the Ambassador that the South Ossetians
<br>continued to shoot at the Georgian villages despite the
<br>announcement of the cease-fire.  Yakobashvili said that he
<br>waited with General Kulakhmetov, the Head of the Russian
<br>peacekeepers in Tskhinvali for some time for the South
<br>Ossetians to show up.  Kulakhmetov tried to call Chochiev,
<br>and other South Ossetians to get them together with
<br>Yakobashvili, but they did not respond.  Kulakhmetov said, he
<br>"does not control anything" and that the South Ossetians were
<br>"shooting at the Georgians behind my back."  Yakobashvili
<br>said that the Russians originally agreed to host a bilateral
<br>meeting with the Ossetians and the Georgians outside the JCC.
<br>Popov came to Georgia for this purpose and announced
<br>publicly it was his intention to do so.  Then, the Russians
<br>flipped and said the meeting should be under the JCC.
<br>Yakobashvili said it was the JCC system that had caused the
<br>mess and it was time for real face to face talks.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) OSCE observers on the ground in Tskhinvali told Poloff
<br>that Georgia's attack on Tskhinvali began at 2335 on August 7
<br>despite the cease-fire declared at 1900.  The shelling
<br>intensified at 2345, with the Georgians possibly using large
<br>caliber mortars and GRAD artillery, with impacts every 15-20
<br>seconds, and the South Ossetians returning fire.  By
<br>observers' calculations, by 0035 there were at least 100 hits
<br>on the city of Tskhinvali, some of them damaging the OSCE
<br>field office there.  Currently, the OSCE has electricity, but
<br>part of the building has sustained damage and the internet is
<br>down.  There was a lull in the activity between 0145 and
<br>0415, when the situation began to re-intensify, and by 0615
<br>loud explosions could be heard.  The number of casualties are
<br>unknown as emergency services are unable to move freely on
<br>the ground due to firing.  Most local residents are confined
<br>to cellars and basements waiting for calm to return.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) At approximately 0400 on August 8, the Georgian
<br>National Security Council asked the U.S. for the return of
<br>1,000 of its troops from Iraq, 500 within the next 24 hours,
<br>and the remainder within 48 hours.  A regularly scheduled
<br>rotator flight may return up to 250 troops to Georgia by this
<br>afternoon.  (Note: USG agreement with the GOG provides for
<br>emergency return of 1,000 troops within 96 hours.  End note.)
<br>Later, Saakashvili announced a general mobilization of all
<br>reserves.  In a second address, he called Russia's actions
<br>"open aggression" and called on the international community
<br>to help repel it.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Conversely, the Russians have said they believe
<br>Georgian forces are targeting Russian peacekeepers.  They
<br>have told the Georgians that in view of these attacks Georgia
<br>bears responsibility for anything that might follow.  The
<br>Georgians have replied that they are avoiding any conflict
<br>with the peacekeepers as well as civilians.  The Georgians
<br>believe the South Ossetians are targeting the Russians to
<br>provoke a bigger Georgian-Russian conflict.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) The South Ossetians are reportedly now accusing the
<br>Russians of betraying them.  One plausible explanation for
<br>all this is that de facto leader Kokoity decided to roll the
<br>dice and stimulate a conflict with the Georgians in hopes of
<br>bringing in the Russians and thereby saving himself or
<br>enhancing his position.  Reports that Kokoity has left
<br>Tskhinvali remain unconfirmed.
