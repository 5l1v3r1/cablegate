<br>SUBJECT: NICARAGUA'S MOST WANTED PART I: THE CRIMES OF 
<br>DANIEL ORTEGA AND HIS FAMILY 
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) In preparation for the November 2006 national 
<br>elections in Nicaragua, post has developed three "rap sheets" 
<br>on the records of Daniel Ortega, the Sandinista party (FSLN) 
<br>and Arnoldo Aleman, highlighting their systematic crimes and 
<br>abuses. The rap sheets contain short summaries of the crimes 
<br>and abuses committed, as well as details on the sources of 
<br>the information. Post intends to use the information from 
<br>these rap sheets in discussions with domestic and 
<br>international interlocutors as a means of reminding 
<br>Nicaraguan voters and others of the true character of Aleman, 
<br>Ortega, and the Sandinistas. While the summaries themselves 
<br>are unclassified, some of the sources of information are SBU. 
<br>Post will distribute the summaries to appropriate contacts, 
<br>but not the sources. Post is sending both the summaries and 
<br>
<br>the sources to the Department and other Washington agencies 
<br>for similar uses. This cable focuses on the crimes of Daniel 
<br>Ortega and his family. Septels will cover the FSLN and 
<br>Aleman. 
<br>
<br>CRIMES OF DANIEL ORTEGA AND HIS FAMILY 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>The Murder of Jean-Paul Genie by the bodyguards of Humberto 
<br>Ortega 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) In October 1990, security guards working for Humberto 
<br>Ortega, Daniel,s brother and the former FSLN Army Commander, 
<br>used automatic weapons to kill Jean-Paul Genie (age 16) when 
<br>Genie tried to pass Humberto,s convoy on what is now the 
<br>Masaya Highway. The FSLN used its control of the judiciary 
<br>and the police to cover up the crime, and no one was ever 
<br>held accountable for Genie,s murder. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) Sources: media accounts of the 1990 shooting of 
<br>Jean Paul Genie, personal testimony by Raymond Genie (the 
<br>father of Jean Paul), legal documents filed by the Genie 
<br>family in Nicaragua and with the Inter-American Commission on 
<br>Human Rights (IACHR). 
<br>
<br>Ordering of Torture, Killings, and Mass Murder 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶4. (U) Daniel and Humberto Ortega participated in the FSLN 
<br>leadership council that collectively ordered the arrest and 
<br>torture of thousands of people at prisons and prison camps 
<br>all over Nicaragua. The largest torture camp for political 
<br>prisoners was in what is now the free trade zone near 
<br>Managua,s airport. The Ortega brothers and their FSLN 
<br>associates also ordered numerous murders and disappearances, 
<br>including the killings of hundreds of Miskitos on the 
<br>Atlantic coast and the internment of thousands more in 
<br>concentration camps in 1981 and 1982. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) Sources: thousands of complaints filed with the 
<br>CPDH human rights organization throughout the 1980s, 
<br>testimony of Miskito survivors and torture victims, annual 
<br>State Department Human Rights reports, documents on 
<br>investigations carried out by the IACHR during the 1980s. 
<br>
<br>Rape and Sexual Abuse of Step-daughter 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶6. (U) In 1998 Zoilamerica Narvaez, the daughter of Rosario 
<br>Murillo and the step-daughter of Daniel Ortega, made 
<br>allegations that Ortega had raped and sexually abused her 
<br>over a period of many years. However, Ortega used his 
<br>immunity as a National Assembly deputy and his control of the 
<br>courts to ensure that the case never went to trial. Having 
<br>ensured he would never face trial, Ortega then actively 
<br>sabotaged all efforts by the Nicaraguan government to provide 
<br>justice to Narvaez and used his mother and Rosario Murillo in 
<br>a public relations campaign intended to bury the allegations. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (U) Such misogynistic attitudes are common in the FSLN, 
<br>as is the tolerance of domestic and sexual violence. When 
<br>FSLN National Assembly deputies voted to lower the criminal 
<br>penalties for statutory rape in March 2006, FSLN deputy 
<br>Nathan Sevilla justified the vote by stating that sex with 
<br>minors was "normal" in rural Nicaragua and thus should not be 
<br>considered a serious crime. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU) Sources: personal testimony of Zoilamerica, legal 
<br>documents filed by Zoilamerica in Nicaraguan institutions 
<br>
<br>(including the courts, the police and the office of the Human 
<br>Rights Ombudsman) and the IACHR, media records of Ortega's 
<br>"public relations" campaign using Rosario Murillo and his own 
<br>mother. 
<br>
<br>Protection and Blackmail of Fellow Alleged Rapist Ricardo 
<br>Mayorga 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶9. (U) In September 2004, boxer Ricardo Mayorga allegedly 
<br>raped a young woman in a Managua hotel. Sensing an 
<br>opportunity to blackmail Mayorga, Ortega and the FSLN agreed 
<br>to protect the boxer in the courts if he would give the party 
<br>a large portion of his international boxing winnings and 
<br>"advertise" for Daniel in public. Mayorga agreed, and an 
<br>FSLN judge found him not guilty in December. Much of 
<br>Mayorga,s winnings now reportedly go to Ortega, and when 
<br>Mayorga fought in Chicago in August 2005, he dedicated the 
<br>fight to Daniel, wore the FSLN colors, and flashed the number 
<br>of the FSLN slot on the Nicaraguan electoral ballot 
<br>("casilla") to the international media. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (SBU) Sources: media accounts of Mayorga,s arrest, 
<br>trial, his public "pro-Daniel" comments and his August 2005 
<br>fight, private testimony offered by lawyers involved in the 
<br>case, testimony of the rape victim. 
<br>
<br>Daniel Ortega a Thief like Aleman 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶11. (U) Property Confiscations: After the victory of the 
<br>revolution in 1979, Daniel immediately confiscated the 
<br>Managua residence of current National Assembly deputy Jaime 
<br>Morales. Ortega subsequently stole other houses and property 
<br>surrounding the Morales residence and created his own private 
<br>compound on an entire block in downtown Managua. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (U) The Pinata Phenomenon: After the FSLN lost the 
<br>election in 1990 but before it handed over power to Dona 
<br>Violeta, Ortega supervised the theft of billions of dollars 
<br>worth of land and state-owned companies that went to his 
<br>immediate family, Humberto Ortega and other prominent 
<br>Sandinistas. Other companies involved in transportation, 
<br>lumber, sugar mills, and slaughterhouses nominally went to 
<br>the FSLN, but effectively ended up in the hands of Ortega, 
<br>his family, and their closest associates. 
<br>
<br>¶13. (SBU) Sources: Nicaraguan government property records 
<br>document the Pinata and the 1980s confiscations in great 
<br>detail. Ortega still lives in the Morales house and occupies 
<br>the entire block to this day. Testimony of those whose 
<br>property was seized is also widely available and hundreds are 
<br>registered with the U.S. Embassy. Other sources include 
<br>State Department annual Human Rights Reports and complaints 
<br>filed with the CPDH human rights organization. 
<br>
<br>Cover-up of Daniel,s Son,s Involvement in Fatal Car Accident 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶14. (U) On December 11, 2005, a vehicle owned by the FSLN 
<br>struck another vehicle and killed two young men in the early 
<br>morning hours. Eyewitnesses reported that the person driving 
<br>the FSLN vehicle was Rafael Ortega, Daniel,s son and the 
<br>director of FSLN-owned Channel 4, but, in order to protect 
<br>the Ortega family, the FSLN pulled a switch and claimed that 
<br>another driver was behind the wheel. Police and Prosecutors, 
<br>fearing Ortega,s power, refused to investigate the switch, 
<br>denying justice to the families of the two victims using 
<br>familiar Sandinista cover-up methods. 
<br>
<br>¶15. (SBU) Sources: media accounts of the accident and 
<br>subsequent Sandinista cover-up efforts; the trial in which 
<br>the FSLN and its judges covered up the issue of the real 
<br>driver is also a matter of public record. 
<br>
<br>Ortega and Associates Suspected of Ordering Murder of Carlos 
<br>Guadamuz 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶16. (U) In February 2004, William Hurtado, an FSLN militant 
<br>and former member of the Sandinista state security apparatus, 
<br>shot and killed journalist and radio personality Carlos 
<br>Guadamuz in Managua. A former Sandinista himself, Guadamuz 
<br>had broken with Daniel Ortega and used his radio program to 
<br>
<br>criticize Ortega, &Nicho8 Marenco, and other FSLN leaders 
<br>on a wide range of issues, including Zoilamerica,s rape 
<br>allegations against Ortega. Although the involvement of 
<br>Daniel Ortega and Nicho Marenco in the Guadamuz murder was 
<br>never proven in court, the killing was carried out in classic 
<br>FSLN assassination-style and removed a thorn in the side of 
<br>both men at a time when Marenco was running for Mayor of 
<br>Managua. 
<br>
<br>¶17. (SBU) Sources: The falling out between Guadamuz and the 
<br>FSLN and his media attacks on Ortega and Marenco are a matter 
<br>of public record, as is Guadamuz,s complaint to the police 
<br>that he believed the FSLN planned to murder him. It is also a 
<br>known fact that Hurtado was a former member of the Sandinista 
<br>State Security Directorate. 
<br>
<br>Contacts with Terrorists 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶18. (U) Daniel Ortega has had close relations with numerous 
<br>international terrorist groups for decades. During the 
<br>1980s, he invited international terrorists from Italy, 
<br>Lebanon, Libya, the Palestinian territories, and Spain to 
<br>come to Nicaragua to find safe haven and plan future 
<br>terrorist operations. Many of these persons became 
<br>Nicaraguan citizens. Since losing power in 1990, Ortega has 
<br>continued to maintain his terrorist ties, and has publicly 
<br>admitted receiving money from the government of Libya and 
<br>other dubious sources for his subsequent presidential 
<br>campaigns. 
<br>
<br>¶19. (U) In 1984 Daniel Ortega negotiated a deal with 
<br>Colombian drug kingpin Pablo Escobar whereby Escobar received 
<br>refuge for several months in Nicaragua after he had ordered 
<br>the killing of the Colombian Minister of Justice. At the 
<br>same time, Escobar,s drug trafficking operation received 
<br>Ortega,s approval to land and load airplanes in Nicaragua as 
<br>they sought to ship cocaine to the United States. In return, 
<br>Ortega and the FSLN received large cash payments from 
<br>Escobar. Interior Minister Tomas Borge and his subordinates 
<br>went so far as to assist Escobar with the loading and 
<br>unloading of drugs onto his airplanes in Nicaragua. The Drug 
<br>Enforcement Agency (DEA) managed to place a hidden camera on 
<br>one of Escobar,s airplanes and obtained film of Escobar and 
<br>Ministry of the Interior officials loading cocaine onto one 
<br>of Escobar,s planes at Managua,s international airport. CBS 
<br>news later broadcast the film and the entire story of 
<br>Escobar-Ortega-FSLN collaboration is related in detail in a 
<br>2005 book by Astrid Legarda Martinez: El Verdadero Pablo: 
<br>Sangre, Traicion y Muerte (Colombia, Ediciones Dipon). 
<br>
<br>¶20. (U) FSLN leaders, including Humberto Ortega, have 
<br>admitted publicly that leaders of the Argentine leftist 
<br>terrorist group "Los Montoneros" resided in Nicaragua and 
<br>engaged in military activities with the FSLN for an extended 
<br>period in 1979-1981. Humberto Ortega admitted that Fernando 
<br>Vaca Narvaja, the leader of the group, resided in his house 
<br>in Managua. 
<br>
<br>¶21. (SBU) Sources: Ortega has publicly admitted many of his 
<br>terrorist connections, including the fact that he has 
<br>received elections money from the government of Libya. Many 
<br>1980s terrorists still live in Nicaragua and have acquired 
<br>Nicaraguan citizenship (including at least one prominent 
<br>member of the Italian Red Brigades), Ortega publicly 
<br>associated with many of these individuals in Nicaragua 
<br>throughout the 1980s. The Pablo Escobar footage was filmed 
<br>June 24, 1984.
