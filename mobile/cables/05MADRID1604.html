<br>SUBJECT: SPANISH DEFENSE MINISTER: VENEZUELA DEAL DESIGNED
<br>TO SAVE SHIPYARD
<br>
<br>Classified By: Charge d,Affaires J. Robert Manzanares,
<br>reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).
<br>
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: In a meeting with Charge April 22,
<br>Minister of Defense Jose Bono said the only reason Spain was
<br>selling military ships to Venezuela was to help troubled Izar
<br>shipyard. Protesting Izar workers had put a lot of pressure
<br>on the Zapatero government, said Bono. He assured Charge
<br>that none of the ships would have offensive capabilities. He
<br>said Spain "is with the U.S." on international security
<br>issues, such as Afghanistan, but it seems the U.S. only
<br>focuses on the problems in the Spain-U.S. relationship. Bono
<br>hopes his May 3 meeting with SecDef Rumsfeld is very positive
<br>and shows Spanish voters the countries' defense relations are
<br>excellent. End summary.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) On the sale to Venezuela, Bono asked Charge not to
<br>pay attention to press accounts of the sale because "every
<br>time the press talks about it we're selling something
<br>different." The opposition Popular Party is interested in
<br>ruining relations between the Zapatero and Bush
<br>administrations and so fuels inaccurate media accounts of the
<br>sale. Spain, said Bono, is selling a total of eight patrol
<br>ships to the Chavez government and 12 transport planes. The
<br>planes will have no armaments and the patrol ships will have
<br>only machine guns. Neither the planes nor the ships will be
<br>used offensively. Charge countered the notion that the USG's
<br>concern about the sale was related to U.S. commercial
<br>interests. The U.S. believed the sale would contribute to
<br>Chavez' military might and political credibility and would
<br>make him more able to destabilize the region and continue his
<br>anti-democratic maneuvers in his own country.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Bono said that if he spoke English he would have
<br>called Rumsfeld himself to explain why Spain was making this
<br>sale. He said it boiled down to saving the ailing
<br>state-owned shipyard Izar. Izar's workers have been
<br>protesting against Zapatero government, clamoring for a fix
<br>for the company's financial woes. Bono said the Venezuela
<br>sale was one way the Zapatero government could significantly
<br>help Izar. The sale would be Izar's biggest in the last 10
<br>years. Bono added that he had informed Colombian president
<br>Uribe of the sale, and he raised no objections.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) In addition, said Bono, other European countries with
<br>good relations with the U.S. sell military equipment to
<br>Venezuela, such as Sweden. Also, the U.S. does not limit
<br>military sales only to democratic countries -- the U.S. sells
<br>military equipment to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Morocco and
<br>Pakistan.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Bono said Spain is "with the United States," and has
<br>demonstrated this by deciding to lead a provincial
<br>reconstruction team and forward support base in western
<br>Afghanistan. He noted that even though the Aznar government
<br>wanted to take Spanish troops out of Kosovo, the Zapatero
<br>government has decided to leave them there. He also cited
<br>Spain's troop presence in Haiti as another example of Spain's
<br>willingness to cooperate with the U.S. on international
<br>security matters. When considering how loyal Spain has been
<br>as an ally, the U.S. should also look at the access Spain has
<br>continued to give U.S. troops at Rota and Moron military
<br>bases. "It seems," Bono said, "that we are doing everything
<br>the U.S. wants, but the U.S. still doesn't like what we're
<br>doing."
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Bono said he hopes his visit to Washington will show
<br>the Spanish public that relations with the U.S. are
<br>excellent. "I have to show my clients the trip was worth it,
<br>was very productive" commented Bono. Bono reminded Charge
<br>that he was the only minister to attend the Embassy's
<br>election night party in November. "We would like to be
<br>rewarded for our cooperation with the U.S., not required to
<br>pay a toll," said the minister.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Turning to the S-80 submarine weapons system
<br>contract, Bono said the Spanish government is nearing a
<br>decision on the deal. He said the two American companies
<br>vying for the deal are well positioned, but French president
<br>Chirac has asked Zapatero to give the contract to a French
<br>company. Bono intimated that the S-80 contract had the
<br>potential to improve U.S.-Spain relations and is "not just a
<br>project to build four submarines," said Bono, "but will
<br>involve future contracts for 35-40 years." If awarded to an
<br>American company, the contract would also increase
<br>interoperability between the Spanish and U.S. navies.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Bono also said he hoped he could get closure from
<br>Secretary Rumsfeld on the releasability to Spain of the
<br>
<br>SIPDIS
<br>Tomahawk missile. Charge mentioned that Embassy had the
<br>impression based on meetings with high-ranking members of the
<br>Spanish military that Spain was undecided about purchasing
<br>the missile if it were made available. "We want the
<br>Tomahawk," said Bono, "I want to be clear on that."
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Comment: Bono is a Socialist Party "baron" whom
<br>Zapatero narrowly beat out in 2000 to lead the party. He is
<br>one of the Socialists' main Catholic conservatives and
<br>remains one of the most popular political figures in Spain.
<br>He thus has considerable influence and popularity if not
<br>lengthy experience with substantive defense issues. And
<br>while the chief of defense is well respected, he defers to
<br>Bono, as do the services.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Comment continued: Bono took pains to convince us
<br>the only reason Spain was selling military equipment to the
<br>Chavez government was to help ailing Izar. Although saving
<br>Izar is likely the principal reason for the sale, Zapatero's
<br>interest in engaging Chavez is no doubt another goal.
<br>Zapatero believes that by engaging Chavez, he can gain some
<br>influence over him. Bono's remarks also show he believes
<br>Spain has not gotten enough credit from the U.S. for its
<br>cooperation in Afghanistan and other areas, and that the U.S.
<br>government is focusing only on the problem areas in our
<br>relations with Spain, not on the positives.
