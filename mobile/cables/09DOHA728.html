<br>SUBJECT: QATAR,S PRIME MINISTER ON IRAN: "THEY LIE TO US; 
<br>WE LIE TO THEM." 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Joseph E. LeBaron, for reasons 1.4 (b, d). 
<br> 
<br>-- Deputy Secretary of Energy Poneman and Ambassador met 
<br>December 10 with Prime Minister Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani 
<br>(HBJ) to discuss energy research and development, critical 
<br>infrastructure protection, and Iran. 
<br> 
<br>-- HBJ indicated Qatar,s interest in a bilateral critical 
<br>infrastructure protection partnership. 
<br> 
<br>-- The PM was skeptical about the plausibility of Iranian 
<br>acceptance of a nuclear compromise, saying he would be 
<br>shocked if Iran abided by a deal to ship Low-Enriched Uranium 
<br>(LEU) out of Iran. 
<br> 
<br>-- The best way to deal with the Iranians, he said, is to get 
<br>them to dictate the terms of any such deal. The U.S. and its 
<br>partners should strive to get the Iranians to put the details 
<br>in writing, including timetables for implementation. 
<br> 
<br>-- HBJ characterized Qatar,s relationship with Iran as one 
<br>in which "they lie to us, and we lie to them." 
<br> 
<br>-- According to HBJ, the GOQ tells Iran that it should 
<br>"listen to the West,s proposal or there will be military 
<br>action. If not by the U.S., then by the Israelis by the 
<br>middle of next year." 
<br> 
<br>End Key Points. 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) Deputy Secretary of Energy Daniel Poneman and 
<br>Ambassador met December 10 with Prime Minister Hamad bin 
<br>Jassim Al Thani. Also present on the American side was State 
<br>Department Coordinator for International Energy Affairs, 
<br>David Goldwyn.  DepSec Poneman thanked the Prime Minister for 
<br>the meeting and expressed his hope that the U.S. and Qatar 
<br>could strengthen their bilateral and investment ties. 
<br> 
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br>(C) CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION 
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) The Deputy Secretary extended USG appreciation to the 
<br>Prime Minister for Qatar,s support for the victims of 
<br>Hurricane Katrina. The PM observed in response that "We might 
<br>have our own Katrina," an apparent reference to security 
<br>concerns arising from Qatar,s relationship with Iran. Deputy 
<br>Secretary offered U.S. help to Qatar in protecting its 
<br>critical infrastructure and in addressing its broader 
<br>security concerns. Expressing interest in critical 
<br>infrastructure protection, HBJ said he would talk to the 
<br>Ministries of Energy and Interior on how best to take 
<br>advantage of U.S. assistance. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------- 
<br>SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT 
<br>--------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) The Deputy Secretary raised science and technology 
<br>investment, noting DoE interest in partnering with the GOQ on 
<br>energy-related research and development projects. As an 
<br>example of possible cooperation, DepSec Poneman cited 
<br>computer simulation, emphasizing that the DOE national 
<br>laboratories are international leaders in the field. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) The Deputy Secretary reported that DoE had recently 
<br>invested in a nanotechnology program and cited this as 
<br>another possible area of cooperation, telling the PM there 
<br>are additional opportunities for GOQ partnerships with 
<br>private labs. Shaykh Hamad immediately expressed strong 
<br>interest in nanotechnology, and asked the DepSec to provide 
<br>him with a paper on that subject. The DepSec agreed, and 
<br>added that he would be pleased to host Shaykh Hamad at the 
<br>Sandia nanotechnology facility or another national lab. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) Turning to genomics and solar technology as they 
<br>relate to food production and Qatar,s National Food Security 
<br>Program, Shaykh Hamad told the Deputy Secretary that he 
<br>supported research in those fields, but expressed his opinion 
<br>that Qatar,s investment in food and solar technology must be 
<br>done on a commercial basis. 
<br> 
<br>-------------------------- 
<br>(S) IRAN,S NUCLEAR PROGRAM 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (S) DepSec Poneman asked HBJ for his views on Iran,s 
<br>nuclear program. The Deputy Secretary noted that the USG had 
<br>entered into recent discussions with Iran not out of naivet, 
<br>but as an effort to address a humanitarian concern (the need 
<br>for medical isotopes) while also attempting to remove a 
<br> 
<br>meaningful amount of special nuclear material. Even though 
<br>the effort had not to date resulted in Iranian agreement, it 
<br>had borne fruit in the form of Russian and Chinese support 
<br>for the most recent resolution of the IAEA Board of Governors 
<br>in Vienna. The PM expressed his skepticism that the West 
<br>would be able to reach a deal with Iran,s leaders, saying 
<br>"I,d be surprised and shocked if the Iranians do a deal. You 
<br>always think you have a deal with them and then you don,t." 
<br>He continued, "The EU, Chirac, and Solana...they all thought 
<br>they had a deal... Solana said two weeks; I advised him it 
<br>would take two years." 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (S) Asked for his advice on how best to approach the 
<br>Iranians, HBJ said it is imperative that the Iranians commit 
<br>to draft any deal, including a timetable. He reiterated that 
<br>it is important to "make them tell you (what they will do). 
<br>Otherwise they will say 'yes, but...' and the 'but' will be 
<br>worse than a 'no.'" The Deputy Secretary countered that, 
<br>"They don,t want to make a proposal." To which HBJ 
<br>responded, "You don,t understand. Even Mousavi can,t make a 
<br>deal!" Poneman pressed the issue, saying the U.S. would not 
<br>be offering a better deal than what is currently on the 
<br>table. The Prime Minster said, "I know, but this is the way 
<br>they are." 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (S) Referring to the current proposal on the Tehran 
<br>Research Reactor (TRR), Deputy Secretary Poneman stressed: 
<br>"This is a fleeting opportunity. If they don,t take this 
<br>deal, what comes next is worse." The PM noted that the 
<br>Iranians frequently press the Qataris to have dialogue on 
<br>their shared natural gas field and attempt to expand the 
<br>dialogue to include other subjects.  HBJ said that the 
<br>Qataris "are always throwing cold water on their ideas." 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (S) On Qatar,s close ties with Iran, the PM added that he 
<br>knows the U.S. becomes upset at times by what it hears about 
<br>the Qatar/Iran relationship. However he characterized the 
<br>relationship as one in which "They lie to us, and we lie to 
<br>them." Poneman replied by underscoring that "It would be 
<br>helpful if everywhere they went, they (the Iranians) heard 
<br>the same thing."  The PM said for Qatar,s part, he  had told 
<br>Iran that it should "listen to the West, s proposal or there 
<br>will be military action. If not by the U.S., then by the 
<br>Israelis by the middle of next year." Poneman observed that 
<br>the Russians had pressed the Iranians hard during the Vienna 
<br>negotiations, reinforcing the view that Iranian failure to 
<br>accept the Tehran Research Reactor deal would lead back to 
<br>the UN Security Council.  The PM asked if the U.S. believes 
<br>the Russians were in agreement with the U.S. on the 
<br>possibility of harsher measures. Poneman replied that, for 
<br>now, the Russians appear to be holding a similar line to the 
<br>USG on the TRR deal and we remain in close contact with 
<br>Moscow. 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (U) This cable has been cleared by DepSec Poneman at 
<br>Department of Energy.
