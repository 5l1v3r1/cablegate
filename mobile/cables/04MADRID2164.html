<br>
<br>Summary
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) During the Ambassador's June 3 visit to Seville,
<br>Andalusia Region President Manuel Chaves told him that
<br>Spanish President Zapatero seeks "normal, strong" relations
<br>with the US despite Zapatero's rapid withdrawal of Spanish
<br>troops from Iraq. Chaves, a long-time Socialist party
<br>"boss," stressed that the Popular Party had lost the March 14
<br>general election because of Aznar's commitment of troops to
<br>Iraq, not because of the March 11 Madrid terrorist attacks.
<br>Looking ahead to the June 13 EU Parliament elections, Chaves
<br>said that while the Socialists are favored to win, the public
<br>is apathetic. A low turnout would boost the Popular Party's
<br>chances. The Ambassador also met in Seville with Jose
<br>Antonio Viera, central government delegate to Andalusia.
<br>Viera expressed concerns that Islamist terrorists might hide
<br>among the 2.7 million Moroccans expected to travel through
<br>Andalusia in July and August. Andalusian business leaders
<br>expressed high regard for Second VP and Economy Minister
<br>Solbes, but were worried that the Zapatero government, as a
<br>whole, might be bad for business. End Summary.
<br>
<br>Reaching out to the Regions
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) The Ambassador made a one-day visit June 3 to
<br>Seville, the capital of Andalusia, as part of his program of
<br>regular travel to Spain's 17 regions. Andalusia has long
<br>been a Socialist stronghold, and Socialist former President
<br>Felipe Gonzalez hails from there. Andalusia is Spain's
<br>largest region, both geographically and in population, with
<br>over 7.4 million inhabitants. It is also one of Spain's
<br>poorest regions. Tens of thousands of rural residents live
<br>on welfare payments (known as PER) targeted at seasonal
<br>agricultural workers. The Socialist government distributes
<br>the benefits at the local level and this patronage provides
<br>them with a solid bloc of voters.
<br>
<br>Chaves Adamant on Iraq
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) The Ambassador began his visit to Seville with a
<br>call on Socialist "Baron," Manuel Chaves. Chaves, President
<br>of Andalusia since 1990, won re-election to a fourth term on
<br>March 14 regaining an absolute majority for the Socialists in
<br>the regional parliament. The Ambassador congratulated
<br>Chaves on his victory. Chaves responded with a commentary
<br>on Iraq. He said the withdrawal of Spanish troops from Iraq
<br>was a political necessity for Zapatero. Aznar's commitment
<br>of the troops went against the overwhelming sentiment of
<br>Spanish society. The US resort to force in Iraq was a
<br>mistake. Zapatero had to withdraw the troops from "Aznar's
<br>war" since they should never have been there in the first
<br>place, Chaves said.
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) Chaves stressed to the Ambassador that Zapatero's
<br>March 14 election victory was due not to the March 11 Madrid
<br>terrorist train attacks, but to Aznar's involvement in Iraq.
<br>If Aznar had not committed Spanish troops to Iraq, the PP
<br>would likely have won nationally on March 14. The terrorist
<br>attacks drew attention to the Iraq commitment, but the
<br>Spanish public did not vote for Zapatero on the basis of the
<br>terrorist attacks, Chaves maintained. What brought the PP
<br>down was Aznar's decision to implicate Spain in the Iraq war,
<br>he reiterated.
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) Underlining that he holds the position of national
<br>President of the Socialist Party (PSOE), Chaves affirmed that
<br>the Zapatero government wants "normal, strong" relations with
<br>the US. He noted that despite the differences on Iraq,
<br>Spain remains a US ally. The transatlantic link is vital;
<br>indeed it is the linchpin of the world order, Chaves stated.
<br>He added that both Zapatero and FM Moratinos are committed
<br>to forging positive relations with the US and were pleased by
<br>their meeting with Secretary Powell in Madrid in March.
<br>
<br>Rota and Moron
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) The Ambassador expressed thanks for the assistance
<br>the USG receives from the Andalusian government for the bases
<br>in Rota and Moron. Chaves raised the issue of the taxation
<br>of Spanish worker salaries, which the GOS instituted several
<br>years ago and has resulted in a substantial drop in workers'
<br>take home pay. Chaves expressed the hope that the US
<br>military and the GOS taxation authorities could work out "a
<br>reasonable solution that is fair to the workers."
<br>
<br>Investor Concerns
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) The Ambassador told Chaves he wanted to pass along
<br>that some business leaders he had spoken with are concerned
<br>about the economic outlook under the Zapatero government.
<br>The Ambassador noted that US companies had invested over $50
<br>billion in Spain in the previous five years and that investor
<br>confidence was key to keeping that trend going. Chaves said
<br>he would pass those concerns on to VP/Economy Minister Solbes
<br>when they meet the next week. Chaves stressed that the
<br>Zapatero government would not change the fundamental
<br>direction of Spain's recent economic policy and that there
<br>was no reason for businessmen to be concerned. The
<br>appointment of Solbes as Economy Minister was a deliberate
<br>signal of the commitment of the Zapatero government to a
<br>responsible economic policy, Chaves said.
<br>
<br>June 13 EU Parliament Election: Turnout Key
<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU) Regarding the outlook for the June 13 EU
<br>parliamentary election, Chaves said he was uncertain. Voter
<br>interest in the EU election is low. Turnout is likely to be
<br>especially low since the EU vote comes only three months
<br>after the intense national elections of March 14. In
<br>addition, previous EU parliamentary elections had been held
<br>in conjunction with other Spanish elections, while this one
<br>is stand-alone. Popular Party voters may be more motivated
<br>than PSOE voters. The PP certainly hopes this is the case,
<br>and is working hard to turn its voters out. On the positive
<br>side for PSOE, Chaves said, Zapatero is enjoying a honeymoon.
<br>The decision to pull the troops from Iraq was highly
<br>popular.
<br>
<br>2.7 Million Moroccans Crossing the Strait This Summer
<br>
<br>¶9. (SBU) The Ambassador also met with the central
<br>government's delegate to the Andalusia, Jose Antonio Viera.
<br>(One of the delegate's primary functions is to coordinate the
<br>activities of the national police and Guardia Civil in the
<br>region.) Viera, who until March was Employment and
<br>Technology Counselor in Chaves' pre-March 14 government,
<br>agreed that the June 13 EU parliament election would have
<br>much lower turnout than the March 14 general election. He
<br>added that this was unfortunate, since EU issues directly
<br>affect Andalusia. Labor costs in Andalusia have been
<br>relatively low by EU standards. However, the expansion of
<br>the EU largely eliminates the cost advantage of Andalusian
<br>labor and may encourage some investors to locate in Eastern
<br>Europe instead. As a result, Andalusian businessmen must
<br>now focus on Andalusia becoming a higher value investment
<br>location, not just a low labor cost location.
<br>
<br>¶10. (SBU) Viera also discussed Morocco. He noted that
<br>during July and August about 2.7 million Moroccans would
<br>drive through Spain on their way across the Strait of
<br>Gibraltar to spend the summer vacation with their families.
<br>Many come from France, Belgium or elsewhere in the EU.
<br>Viera expressed concerns about the ability of terrorists to
<br>mix among the travelers. He said police would step up
<br>their presence to monitor the Moroccan travelers. He
<br>commented that Spain, as Europe's frontier state with
<br>Morocco, was bearing the brunt of such travel. Viera said
<br>the EU must do more to reach out to the Maghreb to fight
<br>organized crime, terrorism, drug running and immigrant
<br>smuggling. Broadening the system for legal guest workers
<br>is another goal.
<br>
<br>¶11. (SBU) Regarding the flow of illegal immigrants across
<br>the Strait of Gibraltar, Viera said that Spain's electronic
<br>monitoring system was highly effective and enabled Spanish
<br>police to see the entire coast. Spain will be adding more
<br>air patrols to the mix in the next few months to improve
<br>efficiency. This is important to cut down on the many
<br>immigrant deaths that occur in the crossing of the Strait, he
<br>said.
<br>
<br>Businessmen: Respect for Solbes, But Still Concern
<br>
<br>¶12. (SBU) The Ambassador also addressed the Andalusian
<br>Business Confederation. In the lunch that followed, the
<br>Andalusian business leaders conveyed a cautious attitude
<br>toward the Zapatero government's economic policy and the
<br>potential for a loss of budget discipline. They also
<br>expressed worries that, in the wake of the Spanish pullout
<br>from Iraq, Spanish products might face a backlash by US
<br>consumers. Nonetheless, they had high regard for Economy
<br>Minister Solbes. Some credited Solbes as being the one who
<br>started Spain on the path to economic growth when he was in
<br>Felipe Gonzalez's last cabinet in the mid 1990's. The
<br>question, they said, is not Solbes, but whether Solbes can
<br>prevail over others in the Socialist government who do not
<br>share his philosophy.
<br>¶13. (U) In addition to meetings, the Ambassador was
<br>interviewed by various regional media. Press coverage was
<br>favorable.
