<br>
<br>CLASSIFIED BY: Gene A. Cretz, Ambassador, U.S. Embassy Tripoli,
<br>Department of State.
<br>REASON: 1.4 (b), (d)
<br>¶1. (S/NF) Summary:  Following a four-day standoff, the Russian
<br>plane scheduled to remove Libya's last remaining HEU spent fuel
<br>stores departed Libya without its cargo.  Despite bilateral
<br>agreements with the U.S. and Russia -- and intensive outreach
<br>efforts by the U.S. and Russian Ambassadors -- Libyan officials
<br>unexpectedly refused to allow the HEU to leave the country.  DOE
<br>experts are deeply concerned by the safety and security risks
<br>posed by the Libyans' decision.  The seven five-ton casks, each
<br>closed with two IAEA seals, remain at the lightly-guarded
<br>Tajoura Nuclear Facility.  DOE experts requested that the GOL
<br>disengage the loading crane and provide extra armed guards, but
<br>are not confident that the GOL will take the requisite security
<br>measures.  The DOE experts will brief the IAEA of their
<br>concerns, and said the IAEA could provide additional seals
<br>appropriate for long-term storage and cameras.
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) Summary continued: According to the DOE experts, we
<br>have one month to resolve the situation before the safety and
<br>security concerns become a crisis.  They believe Russia could
<br>provide another plane to remove the HEU in late December, at
<br>which point the casks must be moved to their next location.  If
<br>the HEU is not removed from the casks within three months, its
<br>rising temperature could cause the casks to crack and to release
<br>radioactive nuclear material.  If the HEU is not sent to Russia,
<br>the Russians would be required to develop entirely new
<br>technology to remove the spent fuel from the casks in Libya.
<br>Security concerns alone dictate that we must employ all of our
<br>resources to find a timely solution to this problem, and to keep
<br>any mention of it out of the press. End summary.
<br>
<br>GOL UNEXPECTEDLY HALTS HEU FUEL SHIPMENT
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) On November 20 the GOL unexpectedly ordered a team of
<br>visiting Department of Energy and Russian (from Rostom Kirienko)
<br>officials to halt preparations of Libya's 5.2 kilograms of
<br>highly enriched uranium (HEU) fuel to ship to Russia for
<br>treatment and disposal, in spite of the government-to-government
<br>agreement signed by Libya and the United States on October 28
<br>and a parallel agreement with the Russian government (reftel).
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX  The plane, a Russian Antonov 124-100, was scheduled
<br>to arrive on November 21, with loading to take place during the
<br>night of November 21, for shipment on November 22.  Although the
<br>Russian crew already had official Libyan permission to land on
<br>November 21, XXXXXXXXXXXX told the DOE and Russian teams, via his
<br>staff, that the Libyan government did not approve the landing
<br>and asked that the plane be delayed.  The teams delayed arrival
<br>of the plane until November 23.  After several days on the
<br>ground without a change in the GOL's position, the Russian plane
<br>and team from Rostom Kirienko departed early in the morning of
<br>November 25 without the shipment.
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) Since November 20, the Ambassador and emboffs have
<br>engaged Foreign Ministry officials, the National Security
<br>Advisor's (NSA) office, the PM's office, Saif al-Islam
<br>al-Qadhafi's staff, and Muammar al-Qadhafi's staff, seeking an
<br>explanation and reversal of the GOL's last-minute decision to
<br>halt the shipment.  Foreign Ministry and NSA officials pledged
<br>to communicate the problems to Foreign Minister Musa Kusa and
<br>National Security Advisor, Mutassim al-Qadhafi, respectively.
<br>The Ambassador has also maintained close communication with the
<br>Russian Ambassador on the situation.  One official insisted to
<br>the Ambassador that the Foreign Ministry had done everything "by
<br>the book" to prepare for the fuel transfer to move forward on
<br>November 21 and could not imagine what could have gone wrong.
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX he did not know what was holding up the program.
<br>
<br>SECURITY CONCERNS
<br>
<br>TRIPOLI 00000938  002.2 OF 003
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) On November 25, the DOE team briefed the Ambassador
<br>and emboffs on their concerns about the security of the HEU in
<br>its present state and next steps.  The 5.2 kilograms of HEU are
<br>stored in seven five-ton casks, which the DOE experts said are
<br>"highly transportable."  The casks currently are at the
<br>lightly-guarded Tajoura Nuclear Facility, closed with two IAEA
<br>seals that are adequate only for transportation, not storage.
<br>The team asked the Director of the Tajoura facility to disengage
<br>the site's loading crane, in order to prevent an intruder from
<br>using it to move the casks.  They also asked that extra human
<br>security be added onsite, stating that the last time they were
<br>at Tajoura, on November 24,  they only saw one security guard
<br>with a gun (although they did not know if it was loaded).  The
<br>team plans to brief the IAEA about the situation and to express
<br>concern about the security of the fuel. They said it was
<br>possible that the IAEA would provide additional seals and/or
<br>cameras to increase the casks' security.
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) According to the DOE experts, we have approximately
<br>one month to resolve the situation, before the safety and
<br>security concerns posed by the delayed shipment reach the level
<br>of a crisis.  The casks in which the Libyan HEU is stored must
<br>be moved to their next location at the end of December.  The DOE
<br>experts believe that the Russians could provide another plane to
<br>transport that shipment during that timeframe.  However, if the
<br>Libyans refuse to allow the shipment to go forward, the Russian
<br>experts would be required to design new technology to remove the
<br>spent fuel from the casks and put it back into the ponds at
<br>Tajoura.  DOE experts stressed that this would be an
<br>unprecedented operation.  They also stated that the spent fuel
<br>must be either shipped to Russia or removed from the casks in
<br>the next three months.  At that point, the temperature of the
<br>HEU fuel, which is radioactive, could reach such a level to
<br>cause cracking on the casks and release of radioactive nuclear
<br>material.  The team stated that their Russian counterparts are
<br>deeply concerned about liability if the radioactive material
<br>leaks from the transportation casks.
<br>
<br>NEXT STEPS
<br>
<br>¶7. (S/NF) If the Libyans can be persuaded to allow the transfer
<br>to proceed, the DOE team will work with Russian counterparts to
<br>schedule another visit by the Russian plane for transportation
<br>of the fuel, which the team estimated could take up to a month
<br>(that will require the reissuance of overflight and entry
<br>permits for Turkey, Greece, and Libya, as well as cancellation
<br>of other transport contracts that the plane already has
<br>scheduled).  Absent Libya's agreement to allow the shipment to
<br>move forward, the DOE and Russian team will resort to designing
<br>and manufacturing the technology that would be necessary to
<br>unload the fuel casks remotely at the Tajoura facility.
<br>
<br>COMMENT
<br>
<br>¶8. (S/NF) Security concerns dictate that we must deploy all of
<br>our resources to find a solution to this problem.  The
<br>Ambassador continues to seek an urgent meeting with the Libyan
<br>Foreign Minister and other senior officials to press for a
<br>resolution and to obtain information about what instigated the
<br>Libyan decision to halt progress on the fuel shipment.  The
<br>Russian Ambassador has also been trying to meet with any of
<br>several high-level officials, but has been ignored.  The
<br>situation has been complicated by a state visit by the Turkish
<br>PM as well as other visits, and the onset of the Eid al-Adha
<br>holiday, which began here today and extends for four days.  The
<br>Russians did manage to convey a letter from Vice FM Sultanov on
<br>November 24, urging the GOL to let the shipment take place.  If
<br>further efforts fail over the next few days, it may be necessary
<br>to consider a senior-level official call to Muammar al-Qadhafi
<br>to stress the urgency of the situation and the high degree of
<br>concern about the possibility of Libya's backtracking on its
<br>nuclear nonproliferation commitments.  Lacking any other
<br>information, we have to assume that the Libyan leader is the
<br>source of the problem at this point
<br>
<br>¶9. (S/NF) Security concerns also dictate that we handle this
<br>issue with the utmost discretion.  Given the highly
<br>transportable nature of the HEU and the shoddy security at
<br>
<br>TRIPOLI 00000938  003.2 OF 003
<br>
<br>Tajoura, any mention of this issue in the press could pose
<br>serious security concerns.  We strongly urge that any press
<br>inquiries be addressed with a no comment -- or a more general
<br>reply along the lines of:  The U.S. and the international
<br>community continue to work with the Government of Libya to
<br>address its WMD commitments.  End comment.
