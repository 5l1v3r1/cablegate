<br>REF: A. PARIS 777 
<br>¶B. PARIS POINTS OF 3/6 
<br>
<br>Classified By: PolMC Josiah Rosenblatt for reasons 1.4 (B & D). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: Foreign policy has not and probably will not 
<br>play a prominent role in the French presidential election 
<br>campaign, and neither Nicolas Sarkozy nor Segolene Royal has 
<br>enunciated a fleshed out foreign policy vision. (This 
<br>message does not discuss emerging "third man" centrist 
<br>Francois Bayrou, whose views fall somewhere between those of 
<br>Sarkozy and Royal.) While it is likely that French policy 
<br>overall under a Sarkozy or Royal presidency would be largely 
<br>marked by continuity, signs are already emerging that the two 
<br>candidates would -- initially at least -- adopt somewhat 
<br>different approaches to the U.S., the Transatlantic 
<br>relationship, and Europe. Sarkozy favors a relationship of 
<br>confidence with the U.S. based on trust and with each side 
<br>free to disagree (a position which is hurting him with 
<br>voters), whereas Royal's natural reflex is to adopt a more 
<br>distant and critical approach. If both worry that a NATO 
<br>built on global partnerships risks undermining the UN, 
<br>Sarkozy at least explicitly endorses a transatlantic alliance 
<br>built on shared values and emphasizes the complementarity of 
<br>NATO and the EU. If not inherently more pro-European than 
<br>his counterpart, Sarkozy's prescription for moving Europe 
<br>forward on the basis of a simplified treaty is generally 
<br>considered as more realistic (i.e., attuned to European 
<br>realities) than Royal's for a new treaty with an enhanced 
<br>"social(ist)" dimension. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) SUMMARY CONT'D: Both candidates favor restoring the 
<br>place of human rights and democratization as a foreign policy 
<br>standard, although it is not clear to what extent this would 
<br>mean increased criticism of Russia or China in practice. 
<br>Sarkozy is more openly supportive of Israel than Royal (which 
<br>could make a difference with respect to current GOF 
<br>consideration of contacts with a Palestinian NUG), but both 
<br>see resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as the key 
<br>to increased stability across the Middle East. Both 
<br>candidates are committed to France's current policy on 
<br>Lebanon, although without the intensive personal engagement 
<br>of Chirac. Sarkozy is tough on Iran, and Royal was initially 
<br>tougher -- but she has moderated her tone of late, perhaps 
<br>under the influence of new advisors. Chirac's departure 
<br>might open the way for either Sarkozy or Royal to engage more 
<br>positively on Iraq reconstruction. We would expect both to 
<br>remain serious about NATO's engagement in Afghanistan. On 
<br>Africa, while Sarkozy and Royal alike would put an end to the 
<br>Chirac model of personal diplomacy with his counterparts, it 
<br>is not clear what this would mean in practice. Chirac's 
<br>departure will offer a welcome opportunity to reevaluate 
<br>French policy in Africa in particular, including current 
<br>troop deployments. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>INTRODUCTION -- IT'S ABOUT THE DOMESTIC AGENDA 
<br>--------------------------------------------- - 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Foreign policy issues so far have not played a 
<br>prominent role in the French presidential election campaign, 
<br>and there is little chance this will change substantially in 
<br>coming weeks. French voters are focused primarily on whether 
<br>and to what extent France needs to reform in order better to 
<br>adapt to globalization, particularly with respect to the 
<br>price to be paid in lost jobs and social protections. From a 
<br>U.S. perspective, of course, what counts most will be the 
<br>foreign policy orientation of the new president. Both the 
<br>leading candidates -- Nicolas Sarkozy of the Union for a 
<br>Popular Movement (UMP) and Segolene Royal of the Socialist 
<br>Party (PS) -- have in recent weeks outlined views on foreign 
<br>policy and defense issues (refs A and B) and offer some clear 
<br>indications of what can be expected. (This message does not 
<br>discuss centrist Francois Bayrou, the "third man" 
<br>neither-Sarkozy nor-Royal candidate whose views fall 
<br>somewhere between those of Sarkozy and Royal, although he is 
<br>widely regarded as the most pro-European of the three.) 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Sarkozy is above all a pragmatist (witness his recent 
<br>reversal on Airbus, where he originally favored a business 
<br>approach to the issue that he quickly dropped for more state 
<br>intervention in response to popular pressures). In contrast, 
<br>Royal leaves an impression of greater rigidity and 
<br>ideological orthodoxy. This said, neither Sarkozy (although 
<br>he came close in his recent press conference, ref A) nor 
<br>Royal (despite her remarks on defense, ref B) has delivered a 
<br>formal address on foreign and security policy, and it also 
<br>bears repeating that what the candidates say in the heat of 
<br>an election campaign may differ substantially from what they 
<br>might actually do or not do once elected. It is likely that 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00000921 002 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>French policy under a Sarkozy or Royal administration would 
<br>largely be marked by continuity. We believe nonetheless that 
<br>it is possible to draw a few preliminary conclusions about 
<br>each candidate's leanings or "reflexes," particularly with 
<br>respect to the U.S. and the transatlantic relationship; 
<br>market liberalization; Europe, human rights and 
<br>democratization; and Africa. 
<br>
<br>FRENCH-U.S. AND TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONS 
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) As their public positioning makes clear, Sarkozy and 
<br>Royal differ perhaps most in their approaches to the United 
<br>States, primarily in tone if not substance, although the one 
<br>invariably bleeds into the other. Beginning with his 
<br>September 2006 visit to the U.S., Sarkozy has deliberately 
<br>and systematically spoken in favor of putting the U.S.-France 
<br>relationship on a new footing based on mutual confidence and 
<br>trust. Not only in response to (demagogic) accusations from 
<br>the left that this shift risked turning him into an American 
<br>"poodle," Sarkozy at the same time has made clear that the 
<br>relationship would have to be based on equality, with France 
<br>also free to differ with the U.S. -- he cited his opposition 
<br>to Turkey's EU accession as one salient example. Significant 
<br>is not that Sarkozy has abandoned Gaullism -- he has not -- 
<br>but that he has attempted to define it in a way that is more 
<br>explicitly America-friendly or at least America-compatible. 
<br>Above all, he has spelled out the need for active engagement 
<br>with the U.S. at all times; the assumption is that France 
<br>should be able to work together with the U.S. unless, in a 
<br>given situation, our views are fundamentally incompatible. 
<br>In cases of disagreement (e.g., Iraq), the clear implication 
<br>is that France would stand aside rather than actively seek, 
<br>as Chirac did in 2003, to marshal a coalition against the 
<br>United States. Sarkozy's pro-Americanism is an electoral 
<br>liability for him, and his opponents, Royal foremost among 
<br>them, are using it as a campaign issue against him. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Royal has yet to enunciate with anything approaching 
<br>the same degree of clarity the kind of relationship she would 
<br>seek with the U.S., owing at least partly to her relative 
<br>inexperience. But she leaves the lingering impression of 
<br>someone who reflexively wants to keep her distance from the 
<br>U.S. In part this is the product of a lack of direct and 
<br>personal experience with the United States. It also reflects 
<br>the accumulated weight of traditional leftist preconceptions 
<br>-- not to say prejudices -- of the U.S. as a hegemonic and 
<br>unilateral power (leaving aside hot-button and publicly 
<br>popular issues such as environmentalism, climate warming, 
<br>globalization, and our more limited social safety net). 
<br>Emblematic of this distancing has been the relatively greater 
<br>difficulty we have had in setting up meetings with her and 
<br>her staff, or her initial inclination -- before she abandoned 
<br>the idea altogether -- to travel to the U.S. and meet only 
<br>with certain members from the Democratic Party and none from 
<br>the Administration. Moreover, in her public utterances, 
<br>Royal has explicitly accused the U.S. for contributing to 
<br>global instability. The clear implication is that the French 
<br>role in international affairs, more than working with the 
<br>U.S., should consist of presenting alternatives to our vision. 
<br>
<br>NATO AND THE EU 
<br>--------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) These differences of approach are well illustrated in 
<br>the candidates' attitudes toward the NATO Alliance and 
<br>European Security (ESDP). As Chirac before them, Sarkozy and 
<br>Royal alike object to NATO's evolving global role, and both 
<br>cite the argument that the U.S. vision for NATO, through 
<br>global partnerships and assuming out-of-theatre missions that 
<br>go beyond its traditional military role, could lead NATO to 
<br>become a competitor for the UN. Both candidates also insist 
<br>on the importance of increased EU autonomy and cooperation on 
<br>defense (ESDP), as well as on the capability of taking 
<br>independent action outside NATO. But they appear to differ 
<br>significantly in their basic attitudes toward the Alliance. 
<br>Sarkozy explicitly referred to the transatlantic relationship 
<br>as indispensable for being based on common values; he also 
<br>called for retiring old arguments over the pre-eminence of 
<br>the one the other, calling them mutually complementary and 
<br>noting that not all EU member states are NATO Allies and vice 
<br>versa (which may also be convenient in the case of Turkey). 
<br>Although committed to the idea of a political Europe as 
<br>independent actor, Sarkozy's envisions Europe acting jointly 
<br>with or in parallel with the U.S., but not as an alternative 
<br>or counterweight to the U.S. Royal's departure point is that 
<br>Europe needs to evolve and to reinforce its security 
<br>capabilities in order to present an potential alternative to 
<br>the U.S., although beyond her distaste for the use of 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00000921 003 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>military force, she has offered few prescriptions as to how 
<br>that would occur. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) The two candidates also differ with respect to the 
<br>importance of defense. While Royal and Sarkozy have voiced 
<br>support for maintaining defense expenditures at two percent 
<br>of GDP, Sarkozy insisted that it should be "at least" two 
<br>percent. In public debates and discussions, Royal has 
<br>moreover indicated a willingness to reassess France's defense 
<br>budget and programs, most notably questioning the need for 
<br>the construction of a second aircraft carrier. Sarkozy, for 
<br>his part, has made it clear he supports a strong defense and 
<br>that the planned construction of a second carrier must go 
<br>forward. 
<br>
<br>FRANCE AND EUROPE 
<br>----------------- 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Sarkozy does not have a reputation as an avid 
<br>pro-Europeanist, and he has not hesitated on occasion, like 
<br>Chirac, to blame the EU for some of France's problems, mainly 
<br>in connection with trying to prevent the migration of money 
<br>and jobs to the newer member states with fewer social 
<br>protections, or promoting a level of political control over 
<br>European monetary policy. He has criticized "fiscal dumping" 
<br>by newer member states with lower cost and other barriers to 
<br>investment. Sarkozy has also advocated EU-wide coordination 
<br>on domestically sensitive issues such as immigration. Royal 
<br>represents a party that traditionally is viewed as more 
<br>pro-European, although many of her positions do not differ 
<br>dramatically from Sarkozy's on the surface (although Sarkozy 
<br>has been much more strident in calling for a coordinated EU 
<br>immigration policy). However, mainly to satisfy that part of 
<br>her electorate which voted against the EU constitutional 
<br>treaty despite its pro-European tradition, Royal has put more 
<br>stress on promoting a more "social" Europe that would adopt 
<br>EU-wide standards for social protections and labor rights. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Indeed, where the candidates diverge most is in the 
<br>remedies they would prescribe for overcoming the current 
<br>impasse on the EU constitutional treaty. There is already 
<br>evidence that Sarkozy's pragmatic proposal for a "simplified 
<br>treaty" (formerly referred to as a mini-Treaty) that would 
<br>focus on institutional reforms and not require ratification 
<br>through popular referendum has made inroads even with the 
<br>Germans, notwithstanding the official German position on 
<br>retaining the existing draft constitutional treaty. By 
<br>contrast, the Germans have privately expressed to us, and 
<br>French press reports corroborate this view, considerable 
<br>concern over Royal's calls for a new referendum on an 
<br>improved treaty, which they see as a recipe for another 
<br>French rejection. Royal has argued that a referendum could 
<br>be successful if a revised treaty were to include additional 
<br>social protections, but it seems likely that this would make 
<br>the treaty unacceptable to a number of other European 
<br>partners (in particular the UK), and would lengthen the 
<br>negotiating process in any case. In sum, although Royal may 
<br>be more pro-European in theory, in practice Sarkozy seems 
<br>more likely to move the European project forward over the 
<br>short term. 
<br>
<br>FREE MARKET LIBERALISM 
<br>---------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Although Sarkozy is viewed by many French voters as 
<br>a radical free-market "liberal," in fact his differences with 
<br>Royal may be less significant than labels would indicate. As 
<br>the Airbus controversy has shown, Sarkozy does not hesitate 
<br>to shed his free-market rhetoric when he believes the market 
<br>is not looking after France's interests. Both Sarkozy and 
<br>Royal support "economic patriotism," even if Sarkozy 
<br>rhetorically speaks more of European than strictly French 
<br>champions. That said, partly out of necessity in order to 
<br>help reduce France's high debt, Sarkozy would remain more 
<br>interested than his Socialist counterpart in privatization of 
<br>state-owned enterprises. Unlike Royal, he also supports 
<br>cutting corporate tax rates, cutting all payroll taxes on 
<br>overtime beyond the statutory limit of 35 hours, and ending 
<br>France's two-tiered labor market as a means of tackling 
<br>France's chronic unemployment. As noted earlier, however, 
<br>Sarkozy's "liberalism" has often in the past been trumped by 
<br>political expediency -- which would likely be the hallmark of 
<br>a Sarkozy presidency. His demand for more European-wide 
<br>coordination on fiscal policy as a means of reducing 
<br>relocation of French jobs to other EU member countries is 
<br>emblematic of bending liberal principle to accommodate French 
<br>interests. 
<br>
<br>HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEMOCRATIZATION 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00000921 004 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Both Sarkozy and Royal have called for restoring 
<br>more prominence to human rights and democratization as a 
<br>means of remaining true to France's heritage and its 
<br>universal mission. How far either candidate would be 
<br>prepared to make transformational diplomacy a cornerstone of 
<br>his or her foreign policy in reality remains an open 
<br>question, however. It is likely that Royal would take a more 
<br>principled approach to human rights questions than her 
<br>counterpart, and it is telling that Sarkozy justified his 
<br>criticism of Russia's human rights record in Chechnya 
<br>primarily by arguing that, in the modern media age, it is no 
<br>longer possible to hide human rights violations as before, 
<br>which in turns creates public pressures that cannot be 
<br>ignored. At this stage of the campaign, the jury is still 
<br>out on whether human rights considerations would become a 
<br>main driver of French foreign policy. What seems certain is 
<br>that neither Sarkozy nor Royal will be driven by the 
<br>sometimes sentimental approach of Chirac, whose admiration 
<br>for countries with their own long histories and traditions 
<br>(e.g., Russia and China) with a skepticism of the 
<br>applicability of Western notions of democracy and human 
<br>rights to other countries and civilizations. 
<br>
<br>THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFGHANISTAN 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Similar considerations also apply toward both 
<br>candidates' likely approaches to the Middle East and Africa. 
<br>Sarkozy differs dramatically from Royal in his insistent 
<br>emphasis on the need to take Israeli security interests into 
<br>account. This might eventually affect Sarkozy's policy on 
<br>dealing with a Palestinian national unity government, where 
<br>the GOF of late has argued that it would be a mistake to 
<br>isolate Hamas completely if it fails to explicitly accept the 
<br>Quartet conditions. Sarkozy has indirectly criticized Chirac 
<br>for his overriding attachment to maintaining stability for 
<br>its own sake, which encourages authoritarian rule. That 
<br>said, both candidates accept the conventional wisdom that the 
<br>key to resolving the range of conflicts and tensions in the 
<br>Middle East is to find a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian 
<br>conflict. 
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) Both candidates are also committed to maintaining 
<br>current French policy toward Lebanon, although neither will 
<br>be driven by Chirac's loyalty to the memory of former PM 
<br>Rafic Hariri -- both in terms of personal involvement, and 
<br>Lebanon's centrality to French policy on the Middle East. 
<br>Sarkozy and his foreign policy advisors are tough-minded on 
<br>Iran. Royal initially was tougher, demanding that Iran be 
<br>prevented from developing a civilian nuclear capacity, as 
<br>permitted under the NPT. This demand was notably absent from 
<br>her most recent foreign policy remarks. (This may reflect 
<br>increasing influence of former Foreign Minister Hubert 
<br>Vedrine, who is far more dovish with regard to an Iranian 
<br>nuclear capability, including military.) We would expect 
<br>Sarkozy or Royal to maintain France's commitment to NATO's 
<br>engagement in Afghanistan. Finally, Chirac's departure from 
<br>the scene should result in greater openness to opportunities 
<br>to assist in Iraq's reconstruction. 
<br>
<br>AFRICA 
<br>------ 
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) On Africa, both candidates have indicated that they 
<br>would like above all to change the manner in which France 
<br>does business in Africa, with Sarkozy going so far as to 
<br>stress France's desire to reduce its military footprint 
<br>(except in coordination with the AU or under the authority of 
<br>the UN). But this does not mean withdrawal, and France will 
<br>continue to want to leverage its influence to the greatest 
<br>extent possible -- perhaps through an increased EU role -- 
<br>even as it competes with the growing influence of the U.S. 
<br>and China. But both candidates understand they will no 
<br>longer be able to rely (nor do they appear to want to) on the 
<br>kinds of personal relationships that Chirac developed over 
<br>many years with a number of African leaders. The departure 
<br>of Chirac will allow the French foreign policy establishment 
<br>a welcome opportunity to reevaluate French policy toward Cote 
<br>d'Ivoire, Chad, and the Central African Republic. 
<br>Inevitably, troop redeployments across Africa will come under 
<br>consideration. 
<br>
<br>NEITHER QUITE WHAT HE/SHE SEEMS 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) Whoever is finally elected, we believe that the 
<br>bilateral U.S.-France relationship will eventually settle 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00000921 005 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>into a kind of normal balance based on our enduring shared 
<br>interests and values and the intertwined nature of our 
<br>economies on the one hand, and the requirement of a distinct 
<br>French voice and authentically independent positions in the 
<br>international arena, on the other. In the case of Sarkozy, 
<br>we believe it will be important not to set our expectations 
<br>too high, since even his pragmatism will always be tempered 
<br>by the Gaullist imperative of a French "difference," in 
<br>particular vis-a-vis the U.S. As for Royal, although we 
<br>would expect her, at least initially, to maintain more of a 
<br>distanced approach to the U.S., there is no reason to believe 
<br>that she would be anything but pragmatic over the longer 
<br>term. In all likelihood, her personal comfort level would 
<br>rise with increased contact and experience, and foreign 
<br>policy under a Royal presidency would be characterized by the 
<br>signature French mix of strategic convergence with the U.S., 
<br>heavily marked by strategic differences and tactical 
<br>disagreements.
