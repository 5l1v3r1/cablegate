<br>SUBJECT: MOSCOW'S INCREASING FRUSTRATION WITH TEHRAN 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Acting Political M/C David Kostelancik for reasons 1.4 ( 
<br>b) and (d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (C)  Summary:  Official GOR reports and media have 
<br>pronounced the Russian-Iranian relationship healthy and 
<br>Minister of Energy's Shmatko's recent visit to Tehran as a 
<br>success.  Privately, GOR officials and Russian analysts agree 
<br>that there are serious tensions in the bilateral relationship 
<br>such as the S-300s issue, the Bushehr project and the 
<br>possibility of Russia's support of sanctions.  They downplay 
<br>Moscow's ability to influence Iran, noting competing 
<br>interests within Russia that complicate Russian policy 
<br>decisions.  Iran policy remains a sensitive domestic 
<br>question.  End Summary 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>Signaling Iran on Sanctions 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (C) Italian Embassy interlocutors in Moscow reported 
<br>that, during his recent visit to Rome, President Medvedev 
<br>confided to PM Berlusconi that dealing with Iran lately had 
<br>been "frustrating."  Medvedev said he was bothered by Iran's 
<br>refusal to accept the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR) proposal 
<br>and that Iran's reaction showed a lack of trust for Russia. 
<br>While Russia did not necessarily agree that sanctions would 
<br>be effective, he said, the threat of sanctions could signal 
<br>Iran that it was time to change course.  Medvedev admitted 
<br>that he did not know who was making decisions in Tehran now, 
<br>but he was nevertheless optimistic that there was still some 
<br>room for negotiation on the TRR proposal. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C) Ali Mustafabeily, Deputy for Iran and Afghanistan in 
<br>the MFA's Second Asia Department who accompanied Shmatko to 
<br>Iran, told us that it was time to pressure Iran.  The TRR 
<br>proposal was a fair offer, but there was also a deadline that 
<br>Iran had missed.  Commenting that the Iranians were "sly" and 
<br>knew how to negotiate, he said that just last week Saeed 
<br>Jalili, Secretary of the Islamic Republic of Iran's Supreme 
<br>National Security Council, had informed the Russian 
<br>Ambassador in Tehran of Iran's new thinking on the TRR 
<br>proposal.  If the West, including Russia, did not agree to a 
<br>plan in which the IAEA would take "possession" of the low 
<br>enriched uranium (LEU) while it remained on Iranian soil, it 
<br>meant the West did not trust the IAEA.  Mustafabeily seemed 
<br>exasperated by this thinking.  He also reported that Iran had 
<br>conferred with (unnamed) other countries and determined that 
<br>the enrichment proposed in the TRR proposal could be 
<br>completed in five months rather than one year.  Mustafabeily 
<br>said that Russia could not accomplish this process in five 
<br>months, but said it was possible that others could. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (C) Mustafabeily also remarked that he had met many 
<br>members of the Iranian diaspora living in France.  Most were 
<br>involved in business and kept one foot in France and the 
<br>other in Iran.  While uniformly critical of the current 
<br>Iranian regime, they also unanimously opposed sanctions as a 
<br>way to influence Iran.  They believed sanctions would only 
<br>harm average Iranians, not the elites.  Mustafabeily reported 
<br>his own private conversations with businessmen in Tehran that 
<br>confirmed this opinion. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br>S-300s:  Still Yellow Light on Transfer 
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (C) On the issue of the S-300s, Mustafabeily reported 
<br>that the Iranians had strongly criticized delays in the sale. 
<br> Specifically, the Iranian Ministers of Trade and Economic 
<br>Development summoned Shmatko to discuss the S-300s and 
<br>threatened legal action against the GOR to resolve the issue. 
<br> According to Mustafabeily, the Iranians reminded Shmatko 
<br>that they had already paid a considerable amount towards 
<br>delivery of the system and they expected fulfillment of the 
<br>contract.  While Moscow was not considering a refund, GOR 
<br>officials recognized the gravity of the issue and that Tehran 
<br>was likely waiting for Russia's decision on sanctions before 
<br>carrying out its threat of legal action.  Baranov said the 
<br>decision on the Russian side would be made at the 
<br>Presidential level, implying that the MFA was not involved in 
<br>the discussions.  He did note that some in the GOR believed 
<br>transferring the S-300s to Iran would increase stability in 
<br>the region because Iran would feel more secure without 
<br>developing nuclear weapons.

<br>Anti-Russian Mood Grows

<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (C) Interestingly, Mustafabeily noticed an anti-Russian 
<br>feeling in Iran, even to include unorchestrated 
<br>demonstrations in front of their embassy in Tehran.  He 
<br>commented that Russia was being criticized by the government 
<br>and the elites for being too close to the West and for voting 
<br>with Western countries in the IAEA.  Simultaneously, the 
<br>Iranian opposition was also condemning Russia for working 
<br>with the Iranian government.  Mustafabeily complained that 
<br>the propaganda machine was working at full-speed in Iran. 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (C) Maxim Baranov, Director of the MFA's Iran Desk, said 
<br>that Minister of Energy Shmatko's visit to Tehran was a 
<br>chance to calm Iran's concerns about delays at the Bushehr 
<br>facility and reduce rising tensions in the relationship.  He 
<br>said that Russia planned to open the Bushehr reactor as soon 
<br>as technical tests were completed and that confusion over 
<br>dates had led to misstatements in the press.  Baranov claimed 
<br>that Russia was continuing with technical testing and did not 
<br>truly have an expected opening date.  Baranov acknowledged 
<br>that Shmatko's visit came at a difficult time in the 
<br>bilateral relationship, given Russia's recent vote at the 
<br>IAEA.  He noted that, although Iran was upset about Russia's 
<br>decision, Iranians would not directly "criticize a guest in 
<br>their home."  As could be expected, Iranian officials instead 
<br>expressed their disappointment through the media.  Baranov 
<br>explained Russia's IAEA vote as an effort to signal Iran that 
<br>Russia would no longer remain its unconditional supporter. 
<br>He indicated that Moscow felt deceived by the Qom site. 
<br>Baranov also took the opportunity to call for the U.S. to 
<br>consult more closely with Russia on Iran and not limit 
<br>discussions to like-minded countries. 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (C) Baranov claimed there was no clear signal coming from 
<br>Tehran about if or when Iran would negotiate and who was in 
<br>charge.  According to Baranov, Russia wanted Iran to 
<br>understand that, while IAEA Director El Baradei had always 
<br>tried to remain objective, there was no guarantee that the 
<br>incoming director would follow this path.  El Baradei's 
<br>proposal was a favorable deal that might not be available 
<br>after he leaves his position.  Therefore, Russia was urging 
<br>Iran to begin cooperation with the IAEA now on the TRR 
<br>proposal.  When asked about Prime Minister Putin's recent 
<br>statement that Russia had no information about a military 
<br>dimension to Iran's nuclear program, Baranov seemed caught 
<br>off guard.  He confided that backing up such a comment would 
<br>be "complicated work." 
<br> 
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br>Iran's Goal--Capability or Production? 
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (C) Russian Academy of Sciences Vladimir Yevseyev claimed 
<br>that Russia's red line with Iran would be if/when Iran 
<br>withdrew from the IAEA because this would demonstrate that 
<br>Iran's intention was to build a nuclear weapon.  He believed 
<br>that, because Iran was hoping to keep the LEU on its 
<br>territory and needed an excuse to back away from the IAEA, 
<br>its reaction to the vote was calculated and exaggerated. 
<br>Nina Mamedova of the Oriental Studies Institute and Zhigun 
<br>Yefim of the Middle East Institute agreed that Iran's 
<br>reaction was overly emotional.  Mamedova claimed that Iran's 
<br>reaction and subsequent announcement of plans to build 10 
<br>enrichment sites was meant to leave room for bargaining in 
<br>the world community.  Iran was well known, according to 
<br>Mamedova, for adopting harsh positions so there would be room 
<br>for retreat.  She recalled that six years ago Iran reacted in 
<br>the same way to an unfavorable IAEA resolution and threatened 
<br>to build 20 nuclear power plants.  Then, when Iran realized 
<br>that the isolation this decision produced was not helpful, it 
<br>renewed cooperation.  She predicted that Iran would likely 
<br>return to negotiations by early next year but did not know 
<br>when exactly. 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (C) Vladimir Sazhin of the Oriental Studies Institute 
<br>and commentator for the Voice of Russia claimed that Tehran's 
<br>overall goal was completion of the fuel cycle and 
<br>infrastructure to produce a nuclear weapon when they needed 
<br>it.  He did not believe Tehran intended to assemble a weapon. 
<br> Merely having the capacity would be enough to satisfy its 
<br>need for security and self-aggrandizement.  Conversely, both 
<br>Mamedova and Yefim believed Iran's goal was to build a 
<br>nuclear weapon rather than just develop the capability.  They 
<br>believed Iran would not feel secure until it had a small 
<br>number of nuclear weapons to defend itself against the 
<br>"threat" from Israel. 
<br> 
<br>----------------- 
<br>Influencing Iran 
<br>----------------- 
<br> 
<br>MOSCOW 00003010  003 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶11.  (C) Although Russia had long considered Iran as a key 
<br>element of regional stability, most Russian officials and 
<br>analysts agreed that its ability to influence Iran was 
<br>minimal and quickly decreasing.  Yevseyev pointed out that 
<br>Italy and Germany had far greater trade turnover with Iran 
<br>than Russia did.  Similarly, Mamedova lamented that the 
<br>bilateral economic relationship was small, even speculating 
<br>that rumors circulating about Iran's readiness to start joint 
<br>new exploration efforts with Gazprom of possible gas fields 
<br>were more likely empty promises meant to convince Russia to 
<br>defend Iran's position in the international community. 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (C) A carrot/stick approach was recommended by some 
<br>observers.  Vladimir Sazhin said that any use of military 
<br>force against Iran would cause catastrophe in the region or 
<br>even globally.  He advocated balanced measures which included 
<br>financial support to the oil and gas sector, a treaty between 
<br>the P5 1 and Iran on security guarantees, and recognition of 
<br>Iran's prominent role in the region.  If these failed to 
<br>produce positive results, he believed sanctions against the 
<br>banking and oil and gas sectors might be effective.  Yevseyev 
<br>said the international community should remain flexible and 
<br>strive for Iran's integration in to the global economic and 
<br>political system when Iran demonstrates behaviors that are 
<br>more positive.  Mamedova said it was critical that sanctions 
<br>avoid inflicting suffering on average Iranians because this 
<br>would only increase support for Iran's current behavior. 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (C) Comment:  The varying perspectives within the Russian 
<br>foreign policy establishment reflect competing interests. 
<br>From a purely mercantilist standpoint, sanctions against 
<br>Iran, particularly its energy sector, would likely translate 
<br>into a bump in world oil prices, which would boost annual 
<br>revenues for Russia's state-connected energy companies and 
<br>the state budget by billions of dollars annually.  If 
<br>sanctions harm Iran's burgeoning economic relationship with 
<br>China, some in Russia might also regard that as a plus.  On 
<br>the other hand, sanctions could damage Russia's own trade 
<br>with Iran, which is modest (Russia currently has a bilateral 
<br>trade surplus of about USD 3 billion) but concentrated in the 
<br>politically-influential defense and atomic-energy sectors. 
<br>Since many high-ranking officials in these agencies also 
<br>favor a more adversarial policy towards the West, an 
<br>anti-sanctions posture serves them both economically and 
<br>ideologically.  The status quo is preferable for Russia and 
<br>as the decision point approaches Moscow will probably search 
<br>for an outcome that changes as little as possible.  Given the 
<br>stakes for Russia's economy and its relations with the U.S., 
<br>Israel and the EU, this decision will be made by both 
<br>Medvedev and Putin, with implications for the domestic and 
<br>foreign influence each exerts.  End Comment.
