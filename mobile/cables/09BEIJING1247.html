<br> 
<br>Summary 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) At the regular meeting of G-5 Ambassadors in Beijing 
<br>May 8, French DCM Nicholas Chapuis reported that State 
<br>Councilor Dai Bingguo told visiting former French President 
<br>Chirac that the West would not gain from more sanctions on 
<br>North Korea.  Dai reportedly said that "the lever of economic 
<br>development" had not been used effectively in Six-Party Talks 
<br>and that a U.S.-DPRK dialogue was "the only way to make 
<br>progress."  German Ambassador Michael Schaefer reported that 
<br>Germany had informed China of the U.S. request to accept some 
<br>Uighur detainees held at Guantanamo and had been subsequently 
<br>warned by China of "a heavy burden on bilateral relations" if 
<br>Germany were to accept any detainees.  Japanese DCM Kunio 
<br>Umeda reported that Premier Wen Jiabao was "tired and seemed 
<br>under a lot of pressure" during his meeting with visiting 
<br>Prime Minister Taro Aso, while President Hu Jintao was 
<br>"relaxed and confident."  According to UK DCM Chris Wood, 
<br>China had requested the UK not allow the Dalai Lama to 
<br>transit London or meet with any government officials.  Wood 
<br>reported that local authorities in Gansu Province had 
<br>detained a British Consul, reflecting the authorities' angst 
<br>over foreigners traveling to the Tibetan regions of the 
<br>province.  End Summary. 
<br> 
<br>Participants 
<br>------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) French DCM Nicholas Chapuis hosted German Ambassador 
<br>Dr. Michael Schaefer, Japanese DCM Kunio Umeda, UK DCM Chris 
<br>Wood and Acting DCM May 8 for the regular gathering of 
<br>Beijing-based G-5 Chiefs of Mission. 
<br> 
<br>Chirac's Visit to China, DPRK, Africa 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) French DCM Nicholas Chapuis reported that President Hu 
<br>had not mentioned Tibet in his meeting with visiting former 
<br>French President Jacques Chirac.  State Councilor Dai Bingguo 
<br>had told Chirac that the West would not gain from more 
<br>sanctions on North Korea and that a U.S.-DPRK dialogue was 
<br>"the only way to make progress" in Six-Party Talks.  Dai 
<br>reportedly said that North Korea wanted to open up 
<br>economically and that the "lever of economic development" had 
<br>not been used effectively in Six-Party Talks.  Dai suggested 
<br>to Chirac that, given China and France's "conflict of 
<br>interests" in Africa, the two countries should have a 
<br>dialogue on Africa. 
<br> 
<br>Germany and Guantanamo Uighurs 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) German Ambassador Schaefer said the German State 
<br>Secretary had informed China of the U.S. request to accept 
<br>some Uighur detainees held at Guantanamo, noting that Germany 
<br>had not made a decision regarding the Uighurs.  He noted that 
<br>no German state had yet agreed to accept the detainees. 
<br>Ambassador Schaefer said China had not officially demarched 
<br>Germany but had warned Germany that accepting any Uighur 
<br>detainees would "put enormous pressure on Beijing and a heavy 
<br>burden on bilateral relations." 
<br> 
<br>Sino-Japanese Relations 
<br>----------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) Japanese DCM Kunio Umeda reported that PM Taro Aso, 
<br>who had visited Beijing April 29-30, had said Premier Wen 
<br>Jiabao was "very tired and seemed under a lot of pressure" 
<br>from dealing with the economic crisis, while President Hu 
<br>Jintao had seemed "confident and relaxed."  PM Aso had 
<br>requested China not implement its planned compulsory 
<br>certification of IT products in China, while Premier Wen had 
<br>insisted the law was consistent with China's WTO commitments. 
<br> 
<br>Dalai Lama 
<br>---------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) UK DCM Chris Wood reported that China had requested 
<br>the UK not allow the Dalai Lama to transit London but 
<br>softened the demarche by requesting that government officials 
<br>not meet the Dalai Lama if he were to transit the country. 
<br>French DCM Nicholas Chapuis said China's demarche was part of 
<br> 
<br>BEIJING 00001247  002 OF 002 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>a campaign to limit the Dalai Lama's travel and noted that 
<br>the Beijing city government had threatened to break its 
<br>sister-city relationship with Paris if the Dalai Lama were to 
<br>receive an honorary citizen award from the French capital. 
<br>Ambassador Schaefer said Germany had not received such 
<br>demands from the Chinese, in spite of the Dalai Lama's 
<br>frequent trips to Germany. 
<br> 
<br>Harassment of UK Embassy Staff in Gansu 
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) UK DCM Wood said UK Energy and Climate Change 
<br>Secretary Ed Miliband had recently visited Gansu Province and 
<br>had been accompanied by a British journalist from "The 
<br>Guardian."  According to Woodward, local Chinese authorities 
<br>had briefly detained a British Consul to express displeasure 
<br>with the accompanying journalist, who had stayed in Gansu 
<br>without the authorities' permission after Secretary Miliband 
<br>had departed.  "Local goons" had come to the traveling 
<br>delegation's hotel and threatened to follow a UK Embassy 
<br>female staffer (but did not).  In addition, a British 
<br>"Financial Times" reporter in Sichuan had been harassed by 
<br>local authorities who were apparently upset by the 
<br>journalist's interest in reporting on schools destroyed 
<br>during the Sichuan earthquake. 
<br> 
<br>Climate Change 
<br>-------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (C) UK DCM Wood said the UK Environment and Science 
<br>Minister had recently had talks with Chinese officials on 
<br>climate change.  In the lead up to Copenhagen, China would 
<br>not agree to targets on emissions but was willing to be 
<br>constructive and would come to Copenhagen with a package of 
<br>action items related to nuclear power, renewable energy and 
<br>reforestation.  Wood said his impression was that China could 
<br>be induced to do more on climate change. 
<br> 
<br>Rule of Law 
<br>----------- 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C) Ambassador Schaefer reported that German Minister of 
<br>Justice Brigitte Zypries recently had visited China to attend 
<br>a three-day rule of law dialogue on social security and 
<br>pensions that was attended by 45 Chinese lawyers and judges. 
<br>Schaefer said Germany and China would have another dialogue 
<br>on a proposed law on regulating lawyers, noting that the 
<br>Chinese Government was looking to give lawyers "more space" 
<br>without giving up control.
