<br>Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli for reasons 1.4 b & d. 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) Summary and Background: Fifteen months into his 
<br>second administration, Ortega continues to skillfully use his 
<br>political pact with former President and convicted felon, 
<br>Arnoldo Aleman to keep pro-democracy forces divided, 
<br>vulnerable to coercion, and unable to mount sustained 
<br>opposition. Ortega continues to allow U.S. and other donor 
<br>assistance programs to operate, though he regularly attacks 
<br>the evils of "savage capitalist imperialism." Our 
<br>cooperation with the Police and Military remains good, both 
<br>for training and in fighting narcotics and other forms of 
<br>trafficking--but Ortega continues his quest to bring both 
<br>institutions under his direct control. Ortega's has 
<br>strengthened ties with Iran and Venezuela, and become openly 
<br>sympathetic to the FARC. Our access to the government has 
<br>decreased dramatically, with even routine items requiring 
<br>Ambassadorial intervention. Civil Society and the media are 
<br>under attack. Elections on the Atlantic Coast remain 
<br>suspended. Underlying the political and policy turmoil, 
<br>Nicaragua's economic indicators are not encouraging. This 
<br>message provides an assessment of some of the trends we 
<br>observe from Ortega and his government after fifteen months. 
<br>End Summary. 
<br>
<br>Ortega's Faltering Economy 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) In 2007, the Ortega Administration coasted on the 
<br>achievements of the Bolanos government, but that ride is 
<br>about to end. The government essentially adopted Bolanos' 
<br>2007 and 2008 budgets, and used them as the basis for 
<br>negotiating a new Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility 
<br>Agreement with the IMF. Foreign investment remained stable 
<br>in 2007 thanks to commitments made during the Bolanos years. 
<br>Exports are up this year by 21% over 2007 levels. In most 
<br>other respects, however, the Ortega government is not faring 
<br>well. Growth expectations have fallen while inflation 
<br>expectations have risen. In 2007, inflation reached 17% and 
<br>annualized inflation is running at 22% for 2008, the second 
<br>highest rate in Latin America. The lack of a strong policy 
<br>response to rising oil and food prices worries independent 
<br>economists, some of whom suspect that hidden foreign 
<br>assistance from Hugo Chavez has created excess liquidity. 
<br>Minimum wages rose 30% in the last year, but still do not 
<br>cover the soaring cost of food and transportation. To quell 
<br>demand and keep prices down, the government removed import 
<br>tariffs on basic food items through December 2008, made 
<br>documenting export shipments more difficult, and instructed 
<br>the state-owned grain storage company to intervene in local 
<br>markets. So far in 2008, the Agricultural Ministry has 
<br>failed to deliver needed seeds to farmers in time for 
<br>planting, although it has become aware of the urgency need to 
<br>do so. More radical measures related to food supply may be 
<br>coming, as President Ortega has just concluded a regional 
<br>
<br>MANAGUA 00000573 002 OF 008 
<br>
<br>
<br>"food sovereignty" summit in Managua on May 7. In other 
<br>areas, line ministries continue to fall short of spending 
<br>targets, leaving needed infrastructure and other capital 
<br>projects on the drawing board and causing the construction 
<br>sector to suffer. Tourism and power sectors, both key to 
<br>national economic development plans, limp along as the result 
<br>of government mismanagement. While the economic slowdown in 
<br>the United States, Nicaragua's largest export market and 
<br>source of investment, has attracted political rhetoric, the 
<br>government has no clear policy response. The Central Bank 
<br>has lowered its expectations for economic growth in 2008 to 
<br>3.8% from 4.5% in January, but most economists believe that 
<br>the figure will be closer to 3.0%. 
<br>
<br>Manipulating Economics for Political Ends: CENIs 
<br>- - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) In December 2006, we identified several key 
<br>indicators (REF L) that would guide our assessment of how 
<br>well Ortega was fulfilling his campaign promises to the 
<br>Nicaraguan people, including adherence to fiscally 
<br>responsible, sound macroeconomic, free market policies. 
<br>Fifteen months later the results are disturbing. On April 
<br>15, the government failed to pay on a set of government bonds 
<br>(CENIs) that it has issued to compensate healthy banks for 
<br>absorbing the assets and liabilities of insolvent banks at 
<br>the beginning of the decade (REF C) . The bond issue was 
<br>originally politicized in 2006 by Arnoldo Aleman, but 
<br>resurrected by President Ortega to investigate the leading 
<br>opposition figure, Eduardo Montealegre, who is running for 
<br>Managua Mayor against the FSLN candidate, former three-time 
<br>world champion boxer, Alexis Arguello. Nonpayment on the 
<br>bonds may damage Nicaragua's relationship with the IMF and 
<br>other international financial institutions, and already 
<br>caused credit rating agencies to put two Nicaraguan banks on 
<br>a ratings watch. As a consequence, since April 15, the 
<br>government has been unable sell public debt instruments--no 
<br>one is buying. Nevertheless, key government officials are 
<br>seemingly convinced that they can navigate this slippery 
<br>slope to their political advantage, much as they did when 
<br>they deployed Sandinista judges and government institutions 
<br>to force ExxonMobil to buy Venezuelan oil. 
<br>
<br>(C) U.S. Citizen Property Claims ) A meltdown in the works? 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Another of the vital markers we identified in 2006 
<br>was government progress on resolving outstanding U.S. citizen 
<br>property claims (REF L). Here again the trend is worrisome. 
<br>As of May 1, 2008, the Ortega Administration had resolved 
<br>just 12 Embassy-registered claims for the 2007-2008 waiver 
<br>year; significantly fewer than the 86 resolved during the 
<br>last full year of the Bolanos Administration. We have 
<br>continued to press for the resolution of the remaining 657 
<br>U.S. citizen claims, which include some of the most difficult 
<br>and complex. Our efforts have been frustrated by the decided 
<br>lack of cooperation on the part of the government. The 
<br>Property Superintendent limits her agency's contact with 
<br>Embassy staff to just one meeting per month and no longer 
<br>allows Embassy staff to accompany U.S. claimants to 
<br>individual meetings with the government. The Attorney 
<br>General requires that all communications on property be 
<br>directed to him via Ambassadorial letter. In the meantime, 
<br>the Attorney General has administratively dismissed 54 U.S. 
<br>citizen claims; then categorized them as having been 
<br>"resolved." He recently passed to us a list of an additional 
<br>88 claims that he dismissed because the claimants were 
<br>somehow connected to the Somoza regime. If the situation 
<br>
<br>MANAGUA 00000573 003 OF 008 
<br>
<br>
<br>fails to improve, we may need to consider implementation of 
<br>Section 527 sanctions. While implementing Section 527 
<br>sanctions would conflict with the January 2007 Deputies 
<br>Committee-approved strategy of "positive engagement" with the 
<br>Ortega Administration, we fear that taking no action would 
<br>undercut the credibility of Section 527 as a tool to pressure 
<br>action on outstanding claims. For this reason, we suggest as 
<br>third way, such as a letter from the Secretary putting the 
<br>government on notice. 
<br>
<br>(C) Security Forces: Still Independent, for the time being 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C/NF) The security forces continue to be a bright spot. 
<br>The Nicaraguan Army and the Nicaraguan National Police (NNP) 
<br>remain two of the few independent, apolitical forces in 
<br>Nicaragua despite the Ortega Administration's clear goal of 
<br>reverting both the NNP and the Nicaraguan Army back into 
<br>completely subsidiary organs of the Sandinista Front, as they 
<br>once were during the days of the Sandinista Revolution (REF 
<br>G). The continued institutional independence and 
<br>professionalism of the NNP and the Nicaraguan Army has been 
<br>one of the few positive indicators remaining under Ortega's 
<br>increasingly authoritarian regime and has been the foundation 
<br>of our strongest remaining areas of cooperation with the 
<br>current administration. However, Ortega's continued attacks 
<br>against the NNP, in general, and against popular NNP Chief 
<br>Aminta Granera, in particular, have taken their toll. Most 
<br>notably, since Ortega's dismissal of several high-level NNP 
<br>officials in March 2008 (REF F), Granera has shied away from 
<br>the public spotlight and avoided even the appearance of 
<br>acting against Ortega's interests. The NNP's failure to 
<br>intervene in the violent protests that recently erupted in 
<br>the RAAN have cost both the organization, and Granera 
<br>herself, credibility in the eyes of the Nicaraguan public and 
<br>is a clear indication of Ortega's success in his drive to 
<br>reassert personal control over the organization (REF A). A 
<br>recent spike in crime rates has further damaged the NNP's 
<br>image, especially a worrisome increase in brazen, 
<br>foreigner-targeted crimes. Granera's long term prospects as 
<br>police chief are uncertain at best. If the FSLN does well in 
<br>November's municipal elections, most observers of the NNP 
<br>believe that Granera will retire and make way for her current 
<br>second in command, Carlos Palacios. Palacios is an Ortega 
<br>loyalist who has alleged, albeit unproven, ties to organized 
<br>crime and corruption in Nicaragua. Despite this, we believe 
<br>that he will still be a cooperative, if difficult, partner to 
<br>work with on future law enforcement assistance efforts. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) One of Ortega's first efforts in 2007 was an 
<br>attempt to bring the military under his direct control. 
<br>After the National Assembly forced him to abandon two 
<br>separate candidates for Defense Minister, he chose to leave 
<br>the top two seats at Defense vacant and bestow the "rank of 
<br>minister" on a weak, but personally loyal Secretary General 
<br>with no relevant experience. The Ministry has since been 
<br>purged of all professional-level technocrats, with all key 
<br>positions now staffed by FSLN ideologues. The 
<br>marginalization of the Defense Ministry has allowed the 
<br>uniformed military to largely retain its professional and 
<br>apolitical stance, but has left no civilian buffer between 
<br>Ortega and Chief of Defense General Omar Halleslevens. Thus 
<br>far, the popularity and sheer personality of Halleslevens, as 
<br>well as the personal relationship between the General and the 
<br>President, have prevented Ortega from asserting direct 
<br>control. However, beginning last July, Ortega has used his 
<br>speeches at all military events and venues as a platform to 
<br>attack the U.S. and our "interventionist policies." On 
<br>
<br>MANAGUA 00000573 004 OF 008 
<br>
<br>
<br>multiple occasions Ortega has singled out U.S. military 
<br>personnel in attendance to receive his verbal lashings. 
<br>Halleslevens has been careful to avoid public disputes with 
<br>Ortega, but has also repeatedly and firmly asserted the 
<br>military's apolitical stance and its obligation to defend the 
<br>Constitution, not a particular political party. We have not 
<br>observed the political interference in military promotions 
<br>and assignments that we have witnessed with the National 
<br>Police. In fact, most military observers believe that 
<br>Halleslevens will complete his full term through 2010, though 
<br>they predict Ortega will move to install a more malleable 
<br>figure to replace him. This appears to be borne out by 
<br>recent sensitive reporting. 
<br>
<br>(S) Ortega Foreign Policy: Petulant Teen or Axis of Evil 
<br>Wannabe? 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S/NF) As expected, Ortega's foreign policy shifted 
<br>substantially to the left after January 2007 (REF L). 
<br>Despite Ortega's early and reassuring move to name moderate 
<br>Sandinista Samuel Santos as foreign minister, over the last 
<br>fifteen months Ortega's infatuation with Venezuela and Iran, 
<br>and the promotion of the ardent U.S.-hater Miguel d'Escoto 
<br>for UNGA president (REF B), would indicate that Ortega's 
<br>guiding principle in foreign relations seems to be, "Will 
<br>this annoy the U.S.?" Over time, Santos and the ministry 
<br>have played an increasingly ceremonial role. Routine tasks 
<br>normally be handled at the working-level require 
<br>Ambassadorial advocacy and, despite Santos's assurances to 
<br>the contrary, almost never seem to gain traction. Recently, 
<br>we were advised that Ortega sought a meeting with Embassy TDY 
<br>visitors. We found the Ministry had no knowledge of the 
<br>meeting nor the means to obtain any details. We were only 
<br>able to confirm the details after sending an email directly 
<br>to First Lady Rosario Murillo. We agree with our diplomatic 
<br>circuit colleagues that the Ministry has virtually ceased to 
<br>function. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (S/NF) Chavez "Mini-Me": With respect to Venezuela, 
<br>Ortega is a willing follower of Chavez who has replaced 
<br>Castro as Ortega's mentor. Initially the relationship seemed 
<br>largely a mutual admiration society with Chavez slow to send 
<br>assistance; however, the ALBA alliance has finally begun to 
<br>produce monetary benefit for Ortega and the FSLN. We have 
<br>first-hand reports that GON officials receive suitcases full 
<br>of cash from Venezuelan officials during official trips to 
<br>Caracas. We also believe that Ortega's retreat last year 
<br>from his demand that the Citizens Power Councils (CPCs) be 
<br>publicly funded was due in part to the fact that the 
<br>Venezuelan cash pipeline had come on-line. Multiple contacts 
<br>have told us that Ortega uses Venezuelan oil cash to fund the 
<br>CPCs and FSLN municipal election campaigns. Several 
<br>unconfirmed reports indicate that Ortega will have as much as 
<br>500 million dollars at his disposal over the course of 2008. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (S/NF) Unrequited Love for Iran: Regarding Iran, Ortega 
<br>had earnestly hoped to improve relations with Iran, which he 
<br>views as Nicaragua's revolutionary soul mate, both having 
<br>toppled authoritarian regimes in the same year, 1979. But 
<br>Ortega's early flurry of activity that re-established formal 
<br>relations and saw reciprocal state visits appears to be a 
<br>case of unrequited love. Iran has sent multiple "private 
<br>investment delegations" (REF E), but to date, Tehran has 
<br>signed no investment deals nor responded to Ortega's request 
<br>to forgive Nicaraguan sovereign debt held by Iran. In fact, 
<br>Taiwan has been more forthcoming with direct assistance than 
<br>Iran. 
<br>
<br>MANAGUA 00000573 005 OF 008 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶10. (S/NF) "What the FARC?" Perhaps the most disturbing 
<br>recent development in Ortega's foreign policy relates to his 
<br>increasingly public support for the FARC. Ortega and the 
<br>FSLN have a long-standing, clandestine relationship with 
<br>Manuel Mirulanda and the FARC, but which publicly had seemed 
<br>dormant until five months ago when Ortega initiated 
<br>saber-rattling against Colombia over the San Andres 
<br>archipelago during an ALBA meeting in Caracas. Tensions 
<br>reached a peak in March when Ortega, at the behest of Chavez, 
<br>broke diplomatic relations with Colombia, following its 
<br>strike into Ecuador against FARC leader Raul Reyes, only to 
<br>restore them a day later after a tempestuous Rio Group 
<br>meeting. Since that point, Ortega has come perilously close 
<br>to declaring open support for the FARC. In late April, 
<br>Ortega appeared at the airport to greet Lucia Morett, a 
<br>Mexican student and alleged FARC supporter who survived the 
<br>March attack. Media reports persist that Ortega offered 
<br>asylum and citizenship to Morett. The Foreign Ministry's 
<br>reply to our direct questions on the topic was "nothing was 
<br>requested, nothing was offered," insisting that media usage 
<br>of the terms "asylum" and "refugee" are incorrect. Sensitive 
<br>reporting indicates that recently the Government of Ecuador 
<br>rebuffed Ortega's request, through intermediaries, that Quito 
<br>send two additional Colombian survivors to Managua. 
<br>
<br>(C) The Opposition and Municipal Elections: Quixotic Errand? 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) The most important event on Nicaragua's political 
<br>horizon is the November municipal election. Given Ortega's 
<br>unpopularity, the current economic decline, and several 
<br>political factors, one would expect Ortega opponents to hold 
<br>excellent odds at the ballot box. Even so, opposition 
<br>parties have fumbled about without setting a clear direction. 
<br>Confusion reigns in the Liberal camp. The Supreme Electoral 
<br>Council (CSE) decision in February to remove Eduardo 
<br>Montealegre as leader of the Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance 
<br>(ALN) party -- forcing him to re-activate his Vamos Con 
<br>Eduardo (VCE) political movement -- followed quickly by 
<br>Eduardo's decision to run for mayor under a PLC-VCE alliance 
<br>banner, left many in the Liberal rank-and-file feeling angry, 
<br>betrayed and confused. Polling shows that many Liberals 
<br>still believe a vote for the ALN is a vote for Eduardo. The 
<br>shortened electoral calendar forced parties to set up party 
<br>machinery and identify candidates more rapidly than in past 
<br>years. As a result, candidate selection was rushed, with 
<br>many choices made based more on personal connections than on 
<br>electoral viability. The presence of "the Pacto," the 
<br>de-facto power-sharing alliance between Ortega and former 
<br>President Aleman, was felt as well, perhaps most strongly in 
<br>Matagalpa. In February nine opposition parties, including 
<br>the ALN, MRS and a PLC that had rejected Aleman, banded 
<br>together to select consensus candidates. A unity slate was 
<br>announced, but only days later cast aside when Aleman 
<br>insisted on picking the mayoral candidate for Matagalpa under 
<br>the new PLC-VCE alliance. The nine-party unity evaporated 
<br>with each party now putting forward its own individual slate. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) The Liberal unity of the PLC-VCE alliance is 
<br>tenuous. We see parallel, rather than complementary 
<br>structures for policy formulation, strategy, voter outreach, 
<br>fundraising, etc. Guidance and funding from National-level 
<br>leadership is almost non-existent, with many candidates 
<br>unclear how to proceed. We often come away bemused from 
<br>meetings with rural mayoral candidates who appear oblivious 
<br>of the need to develop platforms and campaigns. Many such 
<br>candidates, several of whom could be described as 
<br>
<br>MANAGUA 00000573 006 OF 008 
<br>
<br>
<br>"charisma-challenged," seem to believe that simply being 
<br>non-FSLN will be enough to get them elected. The perennial 
<br>problem of funding persists. Several times a week we are 
<br>approached by local candidates for campaign financing, voter 
<br>registration support and the like. Even with the 
<br>environmental advantages enjoyed by opposition candidates and 
<br>parties, training and clear direction by opposition parties 
<br>will be essential to seriously challenge Ortega's 
<br>well-organized, highly-disciplined, and apparently 
<br>Venezuelan-financed FSLN/CPC election machine. 
<br>
<br>What About the Atlantic Coast? 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) On April 4 the Supreme Electoral Council (CSE) voted 
<br>to delay elections in three communities on the Atlantic Coast 
<br>for six months. The CSE, whose magistrates owe their loyalty 
<br>to President Daniel Ortega and Aleman, ignored widespread 
<br>support from hurricane-affected communities in the RAAN to 
<br>proceed with elections as scheduled. In the weeks leading up 
<br>to ) and since ) the CSE decision, tensions between pro- 
<br>and anti-election supporters have run high, causing violence 
<br>and bloodshed on at least one occasion. Liberal leaders in 
<br>surrounding municipalities are convinced the government will 
<br>use the delay to manipulate voter registries by moving 
<br>pro-FSLN voters from the affected coastal municipalities to 
<br>Liberal-dominated interior municipalities thus tipping the 
<br>vote towards FSLN candidates. 
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) On April 24, the National Assembly -- on its second 
<br>try -- issued a non-binding resolution overturning the CSE's 
<br>decision. On April 25, the Assembly's Justice Commission 
<br>voted out two decrees, one formalizing the Assembly's 
<br>decision of the day before, and the second calling for an 
<br>authentic interpretation of electoral law to prevent the CSE 
<br>from exercising such authority in the future. Both decrees 
<br>will face serious challenges as the FSLN will use its control 
<br>of the Supreme Court and CSE to nullify these measures. As 
<br>the legal struggle plays out in the legislative, judicial, 
<br>and electoral branches of government, pro- and anti-vote 
<br>supporters in the RAAN are preparing for a possible struggle 
<br>of their own, including the use of violence, even armed 
<br>tactics. 
<br>
<br>Un-unified Civil Society Concerned By Diminishing Democratic 
<br>Space 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) Across the political spectrum Nicaraguan civil 
<br>society actors are concerned about the anti-democratic 
<br>tendencies of the Ortega Administration and see an 
<br>increasingly hostile environment for organizations seeking to 
<br>operate freely and independently. Since Ortega assumed 
<br>office in January 2007, many NGOs, particularly those openly 
<br>critical of the government, have experienced various forms of 
<br>harassment, interference, intimidation, financial pressure, 
<br>and threats both from the government and FSLN loyalists. 
<br>Although some actions appear to be innocuous on their 
<br>surface, e.g. unannounced audits by tax authorities and 
<br>related financial penalties, the overall cumulative effect 
<br>appears to be part of a slow, deliberate effort by the 
<br>government to discourage and undermine the independence, 
<br>credibility, and operations of these groups and their 
<br>advocacy of citizen rights and freedom. NGOs, including the 
<br>traditionally left-leaning Office of the Civil Coordinator, 
<br>often have been targeted based on an arbitrary application of 
<br>the law or trumped up charges. Others, such as the 
<br>center-right Permanent Commission for Human Rights (CPDH),

<br>have received death threats against members of their staffs 
<br>and families. Most civil society groups regard the 
<br>establishment of the Citizen Power Councils (CPCs) under the 
<br>central control of the FSLN's executive branch as a direct 
<br>attempt to sideline and ultimately supplant the work of civil 
<br>society. 
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) These organizations, which represent diverse 
<br>elements of Nicaraguan society, share a common conviction 
<br>that civil society is the only viable sector that can keep 
<br>Nicaragua on a democratic path and stop Ortega's 
<br>authoritarian aspirations. Unfortunately, they lack clear 
<br>direction on how to reach their destination and have missed 
<br>many opportunities to really make their mark. Although they 
<br>mounted a successful protest against the CPCs in September, 
<br>they were unable to produce a ripple effect that inspired a 
<br>wider pro-democratic movement. Initially galvanized to come 
<br>together to oppose the government's encroachment on citizen 
<br>rights and freedoms, civil society has not yet demonstrated a 
<br>capacity or commitment to building any sort of unified 
<br>alliance or response to the challenges facing the country. 
<br>Some organizations, led by the Movimiento por Nicaragua 
<br>(MpN), have pledged to unite as a coalition, but to little 
<br>avail. Most NGOs suffer from a shortage of resources and 
<br>lack of a long-term vision to work proactively on concrete, 
<br>sustainable projects. Internal divisions, egos, leadership 
<br>rivalries, and competition for donor resources and 
<br>international cooperation also present impediments to 
<br>building a long-term civic alliance. Despite the weaknesses 
<br>of Nicaraguan civil society organizations, however, they 
<br>remain one of the strongest forces working in defense of the 
<br>country's democratic spaces. Support from the international 
<br>community will be crucial if they are to make an impact, 
<br>given the pressures they face. On our part, we have begun a 
<br>USD 1 million small grants program for our democratic civil 
<br>society friends.

<br>Shut Them Up: Independent Media Being Squeezed Too

<br>¶17. (SBU) In the first few months of 2008, there has been a 
<br>marked decline in press freedom in Nicaragua. Recent threats 
<br>to press include the politicized use of the judicial system 
<br>to convict a prominent local newspaper owner and editor of 
<br>libel, and the mounting of a dubious public radio and TV 
<br>campaign against the same media owner and an opposition 
<br>leader, Montealegre, for alleged public theft. Journalists 
<br>continue to report that only "official Sandinista" media 
<br>outlets, often those owned and operated by children of the 
<br>President and First Lady, have access to government 
<br>information. The Ministry of Health has selectively banned a 
<br>reporter from its premises for reporting that was not in its 
<br>favor. In a space of two weeks in April, four national radio 
<br>stations (3 independent and 1 Sandinista) reported serious 
<br>equipment theft at their transmission towers which knocked 
<br>them off the air for 8-12 hours each. To date, there are no 
<br>convictions for any of these crimes. A few months ago, 
<br>private, apparently partisan security forces surrounding the 
<br>president handcuffed a local reporter when he tried to 
<br>approach the Ambassador to tape public comments at an outdoor 
<br>event.

<br>¶18. (S/NF) Our bilateral interests and commitment to the 
<br>Nicaraguan people remain unchanged. Our goals are to keep 
<br>Nicaragua on the democratic path; to combat corruption, 
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>terrorism and all forms of trafficking; to promote private 
<br>sector-led development and to protect the interests of U.S. 
<br>citizens residing in Nicaragua. Though our interests remain 
<br>unchanged, Ortega has made it increasingly difficult for us 
<br>to work towards these goals, by restricting our access and 
<br>pressuring our partners. He has scrupulously avoided either 
<br>an outright rejection of U.S. assistance or a direct policy 
<br>confrontation with Washington. However, he has worked 
<br>assiduously to undermine any domestic opposition, and thus 
<br>our ability to find partners capable of imposing pressure for 
<br>meaningful change. The Ortega-Aleman political pact remains 
<br>active, and the single greatest, though not the only, 
<br>obstacle to a more open, transparent Nicaragua. Ortega has 
<br>mis-managed the economy and has repeatedly permitted, if not 
<br>instigated, government intervention in the energy and finance 
<br>sectors for clearly political ends. Ortega continues to 
<br>close the space in which independent voices of civil society 
<br>and media can educate and defend the rights of Nicaraguans. 
<br>Though he has not publicly abandoned his post-election 
<br>commitments to keep the country on a democratic path and 
<br>maintain responsible free market policies, there are multiple 
<br>signs that Ortega seeks only one goal ) consolidation of 
<br>power to perpetuate his rule.
