<br>
<br>¶1. (U) SUMMARY. President Zapatero's center-left Spanish
<br>Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) was the victor in the March 9
<br>general election. This cable gives brief biographies for the
<br>cabinet members in Zapatero's second administration.
<br>Overall, the cabinet reflects Zapatero's campaign promises to
<br>focus on innovation, equality and the environment. This is
<br>the first Spanish cabinet with more women than men. Several
<br>key players from the first Zapatero administration will keep
<br>their jobs, including Vice Presidents de la Vega and Solbes,
<br>Foreign Minister Moratinos, and Interior Minister Rubalcaba.
<br>An important change is the shift of Carme Chacon from
<br>Minister of Housing to Minister of Defense. Two new
<br>Ministries have been added: a Ministry of Equality and a
<br>Ministry of Science and Innovation. Other Ministries were
<br>restructured. For example, The Ministries of Environment and
<br>Agriculture merged. The Ministry of Education, Social
<br>Affairs and Sports restructured to include social affairs,
<br>but gave up its science portfolio. The Labor Ministry
<br>assumed responsibility for immigration affairs. Biographies
<br>will be posted to the Embassy Madrid Intellipedia page for
<br>future reference and periodic updates. END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) Zapatero's new cabinet is:
<br>First Vice President for the Presidency Maria Teresa
<br>Fernandez de la Vega;
<br>Second Vice President for Economy and Finance Pedro Solbes;
<br>Minister of Foreign Affairs Miguel Angel Moratinos;
<br>Minister of Justice Mariano Fernandez Bermejo;
<br>Minister of Defense Carme Chacon;
<br>Minister of Interior Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba;
<br>Minster of Public Administration Elena Salgado;
<br>Minister of Public Works (Fomento) Magdalena Alvarez;
<br>Minister of Environment and Marine and Rural Environs
<br>(Agriculture) Elena Espinosa;
<br>Minister of Equality Bibiana Aido;
<br>Minister of Education, Social Affairs and Sport Mercedes
<br>Cabrera;
<br>Minister of Labor and Immigration Celestino Corbacho;
<br>Minister of Industry, Tourism and Commerce Miguel Sebastian;

<br>Minister of Housing Beatriz Corredor; and
<br>Minister of Health Bernat Soria;
<br>Minister of Culture Cesar Antonio Molina.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----
<br>Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega
<br>First Vice President, Minister of the Presidency,
<br>and Spokesperson of the Government
<br>--------------------------------------------- -----
<br>
<br>¶3. (U) Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega continues as First
<br>Vice President for a second term. In 2004, she became the
<br>first woman to occupy a Vice Presidency in Spain. As Vice
<br>President and Minister of the Presidency, de la Vega
<br>coordinates the "political" ministries with a primary focus
<br>on Justice, Defense, Equality, Education and Foreign Affairs.
<br>
<br>¶4. (U) During the 2000-2004 legislature, de la Vega served as
<br>PSOE Secretary General in Congress and led the opposition
<br>party's attacks against the PP's Aznar administration. In
<br>this position, she also coordinated the PSOE members in
<br>Congress to achieve a unified legislative program. She has
<br>been elected as Congresswoman three times: in 1996 for Jaen,
<br>in 2000 for Segovia, and in 2004 for Madrid.
<br>
<br>¶5. (U) From 1994-96 de la Vega served as Secretary of State
<br>for Justice with Justice Minister Alberto Belloch, a position
<br>she held until 1996. During that time she managed the
<br>reform of the Penal Code. De la Vega promoted the active
<br>participation of State prosecutors in criminal investigation,
<br>while maintaining the ultimate control of magistrates in the
<br>judicial process.
<br>
<br>¶6. (U) De la Vega began her political career with the Catalan
<br>Socialist Party, but in 1979 moved her affiliation to a
<br>political movement called "Justicia Democratica", a group of
<br>judges, prosecutors, and lawyers that played an important
<br>role in Spain's transition to democracy after Franco's
<br>regime. When the Socialist Party (PSOE) won its first
<br>national elections in 1982, de la Vega served as Chief of
<br>Cabinet to Socialist Minister of Justice Fernando Ledesma.
<br>In 1985 she was appointed Director General of Services in the
<br>Justice Ministry and under her leadership the number of
<br>judges doubled. From 1988 to 1990 she worked in the
<br>Secretariat of Labor Magistrates and in 1990 she was
<br>appointed spokesperson of the General Council of Judicial
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000552 002.2 OF 011
<br>
<br>
<br>Authority.
<br>
<br>¶7. (U) She was born in Valencia in 1949. She studied Law and
<br>received her PhD from the University of Barcelona. She
<br>taught Labor Law at the University of Barcelona. She is a
<br>specialist in Human Rights and International Juridical
<br>Cooperation with additional training from the University of
<br>Strasbourg.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- -----
<br>Pedro Solbes
<br>Second Vice President and Minister of Economy and Finance
<br>--------------------------------------------- -----
<br>
<br>¶8. (U) As Vice President for Economic Affairs, Solbes is
<br>supposed to exercise control over all the economic decisions
<br>of the GOS, except foreign and domestic trade, tourism, and
<br>energy, which fall to the Ministry of Industry, Tourism, and
<br>Commerce.
<br>
<br>¶9. (SBU) Solbes had reportedly seriously considered leaving
<br>the government at the end of Zapatero's previous term. He is
<br>65, and his wife wanted him to retire. Zapatero convinced
<br>him to stay, and his presence on the ticket was considered to
<br>be an important appeal to the business community, some of
<br>whose members have portrayed Solbes as the only bulwark
<br>preventing Socialist ministers from overspending. Zapatero
<br>is reported to have promised Solbes increased authority.
<br>
<br>¶10. (SBU) In Zapatero's first term, Solbes often was at odds
<br>with the economic office of the presidency, which tended to
<br>favor more interventionist policies. Sebastian has now been
<br>named Minister of Industry, Tourism, and Commerce, and
<br>individuals linked to Sebastian have been named to other
<br>ministries. After Sebastian's appointment was announced,
<br>Solbes told the press, "I am the Economic Vice President. I
<br>am the one who makes decisions on economic policy. I am the
<br>one who signs the economic draft laws. This is a coalition
<br>government between me and the rest." Solbes had clashed with
<br>Sebastian in 2005-06 over the German company E.ON's bid to
<br>acquire Spain's Endesa; Solbes had not objected to the bid,
<br>while Sebastian influenced GOS attempts to block the bid and
<br>later helped broker the eventually successful purchase by
<br>Italy's Acciona and Spain's Acciona. After Zapatero was
<br>re-elected, Solbes had reportedly asked Zapatero to give him
<br>the energy portfolio as well, but the portfolio remained in
<br>Sebastian's ministry.
<br>
<br>¶11. (U) Solbes has traditionally emphasized the importance
<br>of fiscal responsibility and maintaining Spain's budget
<br>surplus. With the economy expected to grow much more slowly
<br>in 2008, unemployment rising, and inflation relatively high,
<br>he will face pressure to spend more, and he has emphasized
<br>for months that the budget surpluses of Zapatero's first four
<br>years have given the GOS more margin to maneuver in the
<br>difficult times expected ahead. He already has announced 10
<br>billion euros in tax cuts and spending increases for 2008,
<br>with about 8 billion expected for 2009. He also will be
<br>expected to address the housing slowdown, which has increased
<br>unemployment and caused serious difficulties for construction
<br>and real estate firms, along with their creditors.
<br>
<br>¶12. (U) A civil servant since 1968, Solbes, in 1982 as
<br>Technical Secretary General, was one of the seven people who
<br>negotiated Spanish accession to the European Community. He
<br>was Secretary General of Economy and Finance from 1982 to
<br>1985 and Secretary of State for European Community Relations
<br>starting in 1985. He was named Minister of Agriculture, Food
<br>and Fisheries in 1991 and Minister of Economy and Finance in
<br>¶1993. In September 1999, Solbes became the European
<br>Commissioner responsible for Economic and Monetary Affairs.
<br>He earned praise for his sense of duty and his courage for
<br>denouncing the institutional rupture that occurred when the
<br>Council of Ministers refused to sanction France and Germany
<br>for exceeding European Stability & Growth Pact budget deficit
<br>limits.
<br>
<br>¶13. (U) Pedro Solbes was born in Pinoso (Alicante province)
<br>in 1942. He graduated in European economy from the
<br>Universite Libre de Bruxelles and earned a degree in law and
<br>a doctoral degree in Political Science from the Complutense
<br>University of Madrid. He is married to Pilar Castro
<br>Rodriguez and has three children (Teresa, Miguel and Lucia).
<br>He speaks French and English.
<br>
<br>---------------------------
<br>Miguel Angel Moratinos
<br>Ministry of Foreign Affairs
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000552 003.2 OF 011
<br>
<br>
<br>---------------------------
<br>
<br>¶14. (U) Moratinos begins his second term in the Cabinet as
<br>the Spanish democracy's second-longest serving Foreign
<br>Minister. In the presidential investiture debate, Zapatero
<br>said that one of his priorities will be the Sub-Saharan
<br>Africa and in next few months, Moratinos is tasked with
<br>arranging high-level summits with Morocco and Algeria.
<br>Moratinos traveled to several Latin America countries in
<br>April to forge ties in advance of the May EU-Latin America
<br>Summit. Some of the pending issues Moratinos faces from the
<br>last legislature are Spanish foreign service reform,
<br>development assistance credits reform, and construction of a
<br>new building to house his Ministry, which is currently in
<br>leased spaces.
<br>
<br>¶15. (SBU) Moratinos was one of the key players behind the
<br>Madrid 1991 Peace Conference and considers himself an expert
<br>in Middle East policy. From 1991 to 1993, he was Director
<br>General of the Institute for Cooperation with the Arab World.
<br>From 1993 to 1996 he was Director General of Foreign Policy
<br>for North Africa and the Middle East. During the 1995
<br>Spanish EU Presidency, Moratinos managed all Middle East
<br>policy issues and was a frequent interlocutor with
<br>Washington. In June 1996, he was appointed Ambassador to
<br>Israel, a position he held for only six months. In December
<br>1996, he was appointed Special Representative of the European
<br>Union (EUSR) for the Middle East Peace Process. Moratinos
<br>managed the EU's relationship with Israel and Palestine, as
<br>well as other states in the region like Syria, Lebanon,
<br>Jordan, and Egypt. However, he created a perception that he
<br>maintained closer ties with Yassar Arafat than with Prime
<br>Minister Sharon. While Moratinos participated in the MEPP
<br>Quartet meetings, Israelis reportedly considered Moratinos
<br>excessively favorable to the Palestinian cause. Moratinos
<br>left the EUSR position in July 2003. His name was mentioned
<br>as a possible candidate for the UN High Commission for Human
<br>Rights following the death of Sergio Vieria de Mello.
<br>However, in October 2003 Moratinos returned to the Ministry
<br>of Foreign Affairs.
<br>
<br>¶16. (U) Moratinos began his diplomatic career as Spain's
<br>Chief Director for the Eastern European Coordination Desk in
<br>1974-1979. He was First Secretary at the Spanish Embassy in
<br>Yugoslavia, where he later served as Charge d'Affaires from
<br>1980-1984. He was Political Advisor in Rabat (1984-1987) and
<br>Deputy Director General of North African Affairs in the
<br>Ministry of Foreign Affairs (1987-1991).
<br>
<br>¶17. (U) Moratinos joined the Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE)
<br>in 2000 and in 2004 and 2008 won election as a Congressional
<br>delegate representing his hometown of Cordoba.
<br>
<br>¶18. (U) Miguel Angel Moratinos was born in 1951. Moratinos
<br>holds a degree in law and political science and a diploma in
<br>international studies from the Spanish Diplomatic School. He
<br>is fluent in English and French. He understands Russian and
<br>Serbo-Croatian.
<br>
<br>--------------------------
<br>Mariano Fernandez Bermejo
<br>Minister of Justice
<br>--------------------------
<br>
<br>¶19. (U) Mariano Fernandez Bermejo was appointed Minister of
<br>Justice in February 9, 2007, and is retained as a member of
<br>the new cabinet. The strong recommendation of Vice
<br>President Fernandez de la Vega ensured Fernandez Bermejo's
<br>appointment and he is expected to strengthen rapport and
<br>cooperation between the Ministry, the Prosecutor's Office and
<br>the Interior Ministry. He is reported to have a good working
<br>relationship with Interior Minister Rubalcaba and Secretary
<br>of State for Security Antonio Camacho.
<br>
<br>¶20. (SBU) As a founding member of the Progressive Union of
<br>Public Prosecutors, Fernandez Bermejo is considered to be the
<br>guardian of the PSOE's judicial policy. Fernandez Bermejo
<br>will manage and attempt to inject change into a judicial
<br>system in which some "conservative" judges have not been
<br>supportive of GOS-sponsored initiatives, including homosexual
<br>marriage and autonomous community statutes.
<br>
<br>¶21. (U) First-ranked in his professional certification exams,
<br>he began his career as a prosecutor in 1974 in Santa Cruz de
<br>Tenerife, then worked in territorial courts in Caceres and
<br>Segovia. From 1986 to 1989 he was Advisor to Minister of
<br>Justice Fernando Ledesma. In 1989, he was appointed
<br>Prosecutor of the Supreme Court. From 1992-2003, Fernandez
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000552 004.2 OF 011
<br>
<br>
<br>Bermejo served as Chief Prosecutor of the Madrid High Court
<br>of Justice. In 2004, he became Prosecutor of the Supreme
<br>Court.
<br>
<br>¶22. (SBU) Fernandez Bermejo is known for taking tough stands
<br>and speaking out on issues. He is the only prosecutor who
<br>has taken a Minister to Court. In another example, when he
<br>led opposition to the Rapid Justice Law, the PP-led
<br>government retaliated by passing a law limiting prosecutors
<br>to five-year terms instead of lifetime appointments
<br>(effectively moving Fernandez Bermejo along in the system).
<br>Expressing his unhappiness with the PP maneuver at the time,
<br>Fernandez Bermejo said, referring to the Spanish Civil War
<br>and Franco's regime, "we fought against the parents, and now
<br>we have to fight against their children."
<br>
<br>¶23. (SBU) He is considered to be a strong personality, not
<br>given to conciliation, and with a tendency to harsh
<br>assessments. "I am a leftist, and I behave like one," he
<br>admits. Perhaps due to these traits, Fernandez Bermejo has
<br>not received the support of the Concejo Fiscal, the advisory
<br>body that reviews judicial appointments, in either of his
<br>positions at the High Court or Supreme Court. According to
<br>the media, many Ministry of Justice civil servants, the
<br>judicial secretaries, and the judges believe that Fernandez
<br>Bermejo, while focused on policy matters, has not fulfilled
<br>his promises on wages or work conditions.
<br>
<br>¶24. (U) Born in 1948 in Avila, Fernandez Bermejo received a
<br>Doctorate in Law from the Complutense University in 1969,
<br>followed by an advanced degree in Community Law in 1998. A
<br>Public Prosecutor since 1974, he is an expert on Penal Law.
<br>Fernandez Bermejo does not speak English.
<br>
<br>----------------------------------
<br>Carme Chacon (new in this Ministry)
<br>Minister of Defense
<br>----------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶25. (U) Carme Chacon is the first woman Minister of Defense
<br>in Spanish history. She served as Housing Minister from 2007
<br>to 2008 and also was First Vice President of Congress from
<br>2004-2007. Her cabinet appointment was the surprise in
<br>Zapatero's second administration amidst widely varying
<br>speculation regarding who might be awarded the plum job.
<br>Zapatero made it clear he intended to put in place a broadly
<br>representative cabinet and Chacon brings ties to the Catalan
<br>constituency as well her deep-rooted PSOE political
<br>credentials. Jose Montilla, Secretary General of the Catalan
<br>Socialist Party (PSC) has been one of Chacon's strongest
<br>supporters. Chacon was one of the PSC members of Zapatero's
<br>"new team" after he won the PSOE party congress in 2000.
<br>
<br>¶26. (SBU) Chacon lacks experience in military affairs (the
<br>same could be said of most of her predecessors), but she is
<br>reportedly viewed by Zapatero as a strong manager. Chacon
<br>was quick to visit Spanish troops deployed in Afghanistan and
<br>Lebanon and she is expected to visit Kosovo in the near
<br>future. Chacon served as an OSCE international observer in
<br>Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1996 and Albania in 1997. Her other
<br>credentials include representing the Socialist delegation in
<br>Spain's bipartisan Anti-terrorism Pact. She reportedly has a
<br>strong rapport with Interior Minister Rubalcaba.
<br>
<br>¶27. (SBU) There was some buzz in conservative circles about
<br>Zapatero choosing a MOD who was a "pacifist." Asked about
<br>the label in a recent newspaper interview, Chacon said, in
<br>essence, that if being a pacifist meant valuing peace, then
<br>she was a pacifist. She went on to express her admiration
<br>for the Spanish troops she had just visited in Afghanistan.
<br>
<br>¶28. (SBU) Chacon's priorities will reportedly be the
<br>Spanish military missions abroad, modernization, and
<br>personnel restructuring. The personnel restructuring will be
<br>a particular challenge as some senior officials disagree with
<br>plans to reduce the number of generals and there is
<br>controversy over proposals to adjust Spanish troop levels in
<br>Ceuta and Melilla.
<br>
<br>¶29. (U) Carme Chacon was born in Espulgues de Llobregat,
<br>Barcelona, in 1971. She has a Law Degree from the University
<br>of Barcelona (1994) and a PhD Cum Laude for a thesis on
<br>federalism and human rights. Her post-graduate studies
<br>include: Victoria Manchester University (UK), Instituto de
<br>Federalismo de Friburgo (Switzerland), Osgoode Hall Law
<br>School of Toronto, University of Kingston, and the Universite
<br>Laval of Montreal (Canada). She has been professor of
<br>Constitutional Law at the University of Girona, Spain. She is
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000552 005.2 OF 011
<br>
<br>
<br>an expert in federalism and Quebec's status within Canada.
<br>She is married to Miguel Barroso, the Director of Casa
<br>America and himself a Zapatero insider. They are expecting
<br>their first child in June. Chacon speaks English.
<br>
<br>-----------------------
<br>Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba
<br>Minister of Interior
<br>-----------------------
<br>
<br>¶30. (SBU) Interior Minister since 2006, Alfredo Perez
<br>Rubalcaba is Zapatero's main advisor on terrorism issues. He
<br>is also one of the six members of Zapatero's core team (the
<br>others are de la Vega, Solbes, Deputy Chief of Cabinet
<br>Jose-Enrique Serrano, Cabinet Aide Vidal Zapatero (a cousin),
<br>and PSOE campaign manager, Jose "Pepe" Blanco) that meets
<br>once a week to formulate policy. Rubalcaba is regarded as a
<br>skilled negotiator and parliamentarian. Beside the fight
<br>against ETA and Islamic terrorism, his other challenges will
<br>include perceptions that common crime is on the rise,
<br>continuing efforts to reduce traffic deaths and long-standing
<br>wage and work status disputes in the police forces.
<br>
<br>¶31. (SBU) One of Rubalcaba's toughest jobs will continue to
<br>be overcoming the historic rivalry between Spain's principal
<br>police forces, the Civil Guard and National Police, both of
<br>which fall under his direction. Rubalcaba reportedly tried
<br>but failed to bring the Spanish intelligence service DNI
<br>under his control (it is currently in the MOD).
<br>
<br>¶32. (SBU) Rubalcaba has played influential roles in PSOE
<br>internal operations and he directed electoral strategy for
<br>the PSOE's 2004 campaign. After the March 2004 elections,
<br>Rubalcaba was appointed PSOE's overall spokesman in Congress
<br>and maintained good personal rapport with his PP-counterpart
<br>Eduardo Zaplana despite many harsh political confrontations,
<br>a testament to his equanimity. Within the PSOE party
<br>structure, Rubalcaba is not close to Zapatero insider Pepe
<br>Blanco, and their relations can be tense. Some say Rubalcaba
<br>is the "Lord of the Government," and Blanco is the "Lord of
<br>the Party."
<br>
<br>¶33. (SBU) During the Aznar administration, Rubalcaba
<br>served as PSOE's Media Relations Secretary and was lead
<br>negotiator on the bipartisan anti-terrorist pact and the
<br>political parties law. He served as Education Minister from
<br>1992 to 1993 after several years in key advisory roles. In
<br>1993 he was promoted to Minister of the Presidency and of
<br>Relations with the Parliament, in addition to being
<br>Government Spokesman (a period he describes as "the three
<br>worst years of my life."
<br>
<br>¶34. (U) A member of Congress since 1993, Rubalcaba is
<br>reputed to have a good sense of humor. The media also notes
<br>Rubalcaba's strong work ethic, willingness to undertake
<br>additional assignments, and negotiation skills. According to
<br>the press, his friends praise his ability to resolve
<br>contentious issues and calm excited colleagues. His enemies
<br>describe Rubalcaba as manipulative and quick to exploit the
<br>weaknesses of others.
<br>
<br>¶35. (U) Rubalcaba was born in Solares (Santander) in 1951.
<br>He joined the Madrid Socialist Federation in 1974 and became
<br>interested in politics near the end of the Franco regime.
<br>With his Doctorate in Chemistry from the Complutense
<br>University of Madrid, he taught Organic Chemistry there, as
<br>well as at the University of Contanza (Germany), and the
<br>University of Montpellier (France).
<br>
<br>--------------------------------
<br>Elena Salgado
<br>Ministry of Public Administration
<br>--------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶36. (U) Appointed Minister of Public Administration on July
<br>6, 2007, Elena Salgado brings breadth and depth of experience
<br>to her portfolio. Enjoying a reputation for sound fiscal
<br>management, in this legislature she will have to deal with
<br>the extremely complicated local corporation funding law,
<br>facilitating an accord between the PSOE-led government and
<br>the PP-led opposition, and then negotiating its
<br>implementation between the national government, the
<br>autonomous communities, and the local governments. Salgado
<br>will also be charged with implementing Zapatero's announced
<br>reform of State Administration.
<br>
<br>¶37. (U) Salgado served as Health Minister of Health from
<br>2004 to 2007, tasked with managing federal health and
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000552 006.2 OF 011
<br>
<br>
<br>pharmaceutical spending and expanding public health services.
<br>Salgado's efforts were deemed responsible for the unanimous
<br>passage of the smoking ban in workplaces and public spaces in
<br>¶2005. During her stint at the Health Ministry, the press
<br>termed Salgado, "Minister Anti", referring to her positions
<br>against alcohol, smoking, and obesity. The Spanish
<br>Government presented Salgado as a candidate for the World
<br>Health Organization Presidency in September 2006, but she was
<br>not elected.
<br>
<br>¶38. (U) Elena Salgado served as Secretary General for
<br>Communications in the Ministry of Public Works, Transport and
<br>Environment with Minister Jose Borrell in President Felipe
<br>Gonzalez's administration. She helped transform the National
<br>Postal Office and participated in the telecommunications
<br>liberalization process. She served as a member of the Board
<br>of Telefonica Hispasat, Retevision and Correos. She also
<br>approved the Sogecable (Prisa) and Telefonica merger to
<br>create Cablevision, although the proposal was rejected by the
<br>European Commission, leading to Cablevision's eventual
<br>dissolution.
<br>
<br>¶39. (U) Her other public service credentials include
<br>Director General for Personnel Costs and Public Pensions in
<br>the Economy Ministry and Finance and Director of Studies in
<br>the Small and Medium Business Institute in the Industry
<br>Ministry. In 1996 she was President of the Lyric Theatre
<br>Foundation that manages the Royal Opera House. While she is
<br>not a PSOE member, Salgado does have close ties with party
<br>loyalists including Interior Minister Rubalcaba and her
<br>former boss Jose Borrell.
<br>
<br>¶40. (U) In the private sector, Salgado served in advisory
<br>capacities with Arthur Andersen (1999-2000), Lenci Consulting
<br>SL (1997-2000), and the Social Council of the Universidad
<br>Politecnica (1999-2002). In 2002, Salgado was appointed CEO
<br>of Vallehermoso Telecom, but the press reported she was let
<br>go because she was too intransigent. In September 2003,
<br>Salgado was named President of 11811 Nueva Informacion
<br>Telefonica, the Spanish branch of the German multinational
<br>Telegate AG.
<br>
<br>¶41. (U) Elena Salgado was born in Orense in 1949. She has
<br>a degree in industrial engineering with a specialization in
<br>Energy from the Universidad Politecnica, and another in
<br>economics from the Complutense University. Most of her
<br>professional life has been in the telecommunications world.
<br>She speaks English and French.

<br>Magdalena Alvarez Arza
<br>Minister of Public Works (Fomento - also translated as
<br>Development)
<br>--------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶42. (SBU) Returning for her second cabinet term, Minister
<br>Alvarez is responsible for the government's 15-year,
<br>250-billion euro plan to expand the high-speed rail (AVE) and
<br>road networks, which the GOS says will give Spain more
<br>kilometers of high speed rail lines than any other country.
<br>She was widely criticized in 2007 after prolonged delays in
<br>the construction of the AVE line between Madrid and
<br>Barcelona, with the deaths of construction workers and
<br>construction accidents that interrupted service on several of
<br>Barcelona's commuter lines for six weeks. In November 2007,
<br>the Catalan legislature approved a motion calling for her
<br>resignation, and the national Senate approved such a motion
<br>in December. A similar motion in the national Congress (the
<br>more influential lower house) failed by only three votes in
<br>November. In addition to difficult relations with Catalonia,
<br>she also has had a tense relationship with Madrid Autonomous
<br>Community President Esperanza Aguirre. Many observers had
<br>thought it likely that Zapatero would replace Alvarez after
<br>the election. While she is known for her loyalty to
<br>Zapatero, some local press posit that the powerful President
<br>of Andalucia, Manuel Chaves, played a role in maintaining
<br>Alvarez's cabinet position. Wags claim Chaves recommended
<br>her to Zapatero years ago to get her out of Andalucia and he
<br>insisted Zapatero keep her in the cabinet (and in Madrid) in
<br>his second term. The eventual opening of the
<br>Madrid-Barcelona line just before the election, along with
<br>the opening in late 2007 of AVE lines to Malaga and
<br>Valladolid may have reduced the pressure on Alvarez.
<br>
<br>¶43. (SBU) Alvarez, who joined the PSOE in 1997, served as a
<br>key advisor as Zapatero prepared his 2004 election bid. She
<br>has worked as a university economics lecturer and at
<br>positions in the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000552 007.2 OF 011
<br>
<br>
<br>state agency of tax administration. She was councilor for
<br>economy and finance in the Andalucia Autonomous Community
<br>government from 1994 to 2004, developing a reputation for
<br>expertise on regional finance issues. According to the
<br>press, her husband, Juan Manuel Gonzalez-Aurioles, is
<br>director general of Emgrisa, a business related to the
<br>uranium enrichment and nuclear energy sector. Alvarez was
<br>born in San Fernando, Cadiz in 1952. She has an
<br>undergraduate degree and a PhD. in economic and business
<br>sciences, the former from the Complutense University of
<br>Madrid and the latter from the University of Malaga. She
<br>understands and speaks some English but prefers not to use it
<br>in meetings.

<br>Elena Espinosa
<br>Minister of Environment, Rural, and Maritime Issues (merger
<br>of Environment and Agriculture)
<br>-------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶44. (SBU) Elena Espinosa was named Minister of Agriculture,
<br>Fisheries and Food when Zapatero took office in 2004. Most
<br>recently, she was voted a deputy in the National Congress in
<br>the 2008 election.
<br>At the start of Zapatero's second administration, Espinosa's
<br>ministry absorbs the functions of the former Environment
<br>ministry. The Agriculture Ministry, under her leadership,
<br>had been generally supportive of agricultural biotechnology,
<br>while the former Environment Ministry had generally opposed
<br>it. Espinosa takes on responsibility for Spain's drought and
<br>related water issues. She also gains responsibility for
<br>climate change, which has been elevated to having a separate
<br>secretary of state (deputy minister). She may have a role in
<br>deciding next steps as Spain's nuclear power plants approach
<br>the end of their scheduled operation; Zapatero has said that
<br>Spain will close the plants, but in recent weeks he has
<br>appeared to leave the door open for reconsideration.
<br>Espinosa has not taken anti-nuclear positions.
<br>
<br>¶45. (U) Espinosa's public service began in 1985 in Vigo,
<br>Galicia under Felipe Gonzalez's PSOE-led government. From
<br>1988 through 1996, Espinosa was president of the Port
<br>Authority of Vigo, an active port that is the home to Spain's
<br>largest fishing fleet. Espinosa introduced port reforms
<br>that set her against the local PSOE party leadership. In
<br>1996, Espinosa served as labor advisor at the Galician
<br>Institute of Technical Medicine. She returned to the private
<br>sector and was the number two at the Rodman shipbuilding
<br>group from 1998 to 2004.
<br>
<br>¶45. (U) Born in March 1960 in Galicia, Espinosa holds a
<br>degree in business and economics from the University of
<br>Santiago de Compostela. She is married. She does not speak
<br>English.

<br>Bibiana Aido (new)
<br>Minister of Equality (new Ministry)
<br>---------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶47. (U) A new face in the Spanish cabinet, as head of a
<br>newly created Ministry, Bibiana Aido's challenges include
<br>establishing the new equality law, developing the dependent's
<br>law, and expanding social coverage for legal immigrants. The
<br>new ministry will incorporate the government's Youth
<br>Institute and the Women's Institute along with existing
<br>programs geared at ending violence, increasing the presence
<br>of women in the public life and the private sector workplace.
<br>
<br>¶48. (U) Bibiana Aido will resign from the Andalucian
<br>Parliament seat she won in the March 2008 elections. A PSOE
<br>card holder since 1995, she is Secretary of Equality of the
<br>PSOE's Executive Commission of Cadiz. From February 2003 to
<br>July 2006 Aido served in the Andalucian regional Ministry of
<br>Culture and from July 2006 to March 2008 she directed the
<br>Andalucian Agency for the Development of Flamenco. According
<br>to the media, Andalucian President Manuel Chaves considers
<br>Aido as one of his potential successors. For that reason,
<br>Chaves supported her candidacy for a national-level political
<br>position that would bring her additional public recognition.
<br>Interior Minister Rubalcaba is also one of her mentors.
<br>
<br>¶49. (U) Born in Cadiz in 1977 to a politically active
<br>family, she has degrees in Business Administration from the
<br>University of Cadiz and in International Business
<br>Administration from the University of Northumbria in
<br>Newcastle (UK). Aido speaks English.

<br>Mercedes Cabrera Calvo-Sotelo
<br>Minister of Education, Social Policy, and Sports (Ministry
<br>reorganized)
<br>----------------------------
<br>
<br>Mercedes Cabrera was appointed Minister of Science and
<br>Education in 2006 and will continue her work in the
<br>re-organized Ministry during Zapatero's second term. This
<br>Ministry now manages social policy that was previously
<br>directed in the former Labor Ministry (now Labor and
<br>Immigration Ministry). Cabrera will have to implement the
<br>Law of Dependence and Law against Gender Violence passed
<br>during the last legislature in coordination with her
<br>colleague, Equality Minister Aido. The Ministry lost its
<br>control over Spanish universities, which are now transferred
<br>to the newly created Ministry of Science and Innovation.
<br>
<br>In addition to her work reorganizing the Ministry's scope of
<br>work, Cabrera faces many of the same challenges including
<br>implementing the controversial "Citizens Education
<br>Curriculum," that is viewed by the opposition party as an
<br>"indoctrination" program and that has been contested in
<br>Courts by parents and parent associations. Cabrera will
<br>also manage efforts to minimize the Catholic Church's
<br>unhappiness for taking "catholic religion" out of the
<br>national curriculum.
<br>
<br>A long-time Zapatero confident, Cabrera helped write the PSOE
<br>2000 electoral program. She attended Colegio Estudio of
<br>Madrid. She received a doctorate in 1977. She became a
<br>university professor in 1996 and currently teaches at the
<br>University of Complutense. She has written a number of
<br>articles on business, politics, and economics, and has
<br>participated in an important number of conferences about
<br>history and economic in Spanish and foreign universities.
<br>Mercedes Cabrera Calvo-Sotelo was born in Madrid in 1951.
<br>She is married to Carlos Arenillas. She was the niece of
<br>Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo, the recently deceased former President
<br>of Spain.

<br>Celestino Corbacho Chaves (new)
<br>Minister of Labor and Immigration (Ministry reorganized)
<br>----------------------------------
<br>
<br>A new member of Zapatero's cabinet, Celestino Chaves adds
<br>value with his close ties to the Catalan Autonomous
<br>Community. Active in national PSOE political structures
<br>since 2000, from 2004 to 2008, he headed the Barcelona
<br>provincial government. Celestino Corbacho is the longtime
<br>mayor of the municipality of L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, a
<br>Barcelona suburb that has one of the highest concentrations
<br>of immigrants in Spain, with a reported 22.7 percent in 2006.
<br>He has been a member of the Socialist Party of Catalonia
<br>(PSC) since 1976 and has held several leadership positions in
<br>the PSC. He was elected a L'Hospitalet city councilor in
<br>1983 and was mayor from 1994 until 2008, being re-elected
<br>most recently in 2007. He served in the Catalan autonomous
<br>community legislature from 1992 to 1999 and was a member of
<br>the board of directors of the Federation of Municipalities of
<br>Catalonia from 1995 to 2004. Between 1999 and 2003 he was
<br>the President of the Metropolitan (Barcelona) Transportation
<br>Entity. Corbacho was born in Valverde de Leganes, Badajoz,
<br>on November 14, 1949. He is married with no children.
<br>
<br>------------------------------------------
<br>Miguel Sebastian Gascon
<br>Minister of Industry, Tourism, and Commerce
<br>------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>Miguel Sebastian is a Zapatero loyalist who was Director of
<br>the Economic Office of the President, with rank of Secretary
<br>of State (vice-minister), from 2004 until late 2006. He left
<br>that position when he accepted Zapatero's request to be the
<br>PSOE's candidate for mayor of Madrid in the 2007 election.
<br>He was not expected to defeat the popular PP incumbent
<br>Alberto Ruiz-Gallardon, and his clear defeat does not seem to
<br>have damaged his influence over policy within the PSOE. In
<br>his Presidency position, Sebastian clashed with Second Vice
<br>President and Finance and Economy Minister Pedro Solbes,
<br>generally taking more interventionist positions than Solbes.
<br>Sebastian was closely involved in the GOS' efforts to prevent
<br>the German electric utility E.ON from purchasing Spanish
<br>utility Endesa, and he was reported to have helped broker the
<br>eventually successful bid by the Italian company Enel and
<br>Spain's Acciona to acquire Endesa. In the weeks after the
<br>March 9 election, he has been reported to be encouraging
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000552 009.2 OF 011
<br>
<br>
<br>deals among Spain's energy companies that would prevent
<br>France's EDF from taking over Spain's Iberdrola. As Minister
<br>of Industry, Tourism, and Commerce, he has formal
<br>responsibility for energy regulation, and he has named a
<br>former subordinate at the Economic Office of the President,
<br>Pedro Marin, to be Secretary General of Energy. (Solbes had
<br>reportedly sought to gain responsibility for energy in this
<br>government.) Two of the new ministers, Science and
<br>Innovation Minister Cristina Garmendia and Housing Minister
<br>Beatriz Corredor, are said to be Sebastian allies.
<br>
<br>Sebastian was born on May 13, 1957. He has a degree in
<br>Economic and Business Sciences from Madrid's Complutense
<br>University and a PhD. in economics from the University of
<br>Minnesota. His doctoral studies were partially financed by a
<br>Fulbright Scholarship. He has worked in the planning office
<br>of the Economy and Finance Ministry and the Central Bank's
<br>economic studies office. In the private sector, he was
<br>Director of Studies (chief economist) for Banco Bilbao
<br>Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA) and its predecessor. He is viewed
<br>as a competent and pragmatic economist who is also a PSOE
<br>partisan and is likely to take political considerations into
<br>account in setting policy. He speaks English and has
<br>emphasized the importance of encouraging Spaniards to learn
<br>English.

<br>Cristina Garmendia Mendizabal (new)
<br>Minister of Science and Innovation (new Ministry)
<br>-----------------------------------------
<br>
<br>Cristina Garmendia is a biotechnology business executive who
<br>is connected to new Minister of Industry, Tourism, and
<br>Commerce Miguel Sebastian. From 2005 through 2008 she was in
<br>the science and technology office within the Office for
<br>Economic Affairs of the President that was headed by
<br>Sebastian from 2005 through 2007. Sebastian is reported to
<br>have recommended her selection to President Zapatero. Some
<br>political analysts have speculated that her selection is also
<br>a reward for the excellent results the PSOE obtained in the
<br>Basque Country in the 2008 elections; Zapatero's previous
<br>Cabinet did not include any Basque ministers. According to
<br>press reports, she is not a member of the PSOE. Garmendia's
<br>ministry is a new one that has taken portfolios from several
<br>other ministries, including the Ministries of Health and
<br>Education. Press reports have described its creation as a
<br>sign of Zapatero's emphasis on encouraging research and
<br>development in order to boost Spain's productivity over the
<br>long term and contribute to economic growth. After being
<br>named Minister, Garmendia told a reporter that her ministry
<br>would work with the business sector, universities, and the
<br>public sector to take full advantage of scientific knowledge.
<br>
<br>
<br>Garmendia is from San Sebastian in the Basque Country. In
<br>1985 she received an undergraduate degree in biology with a
<br>specialization in genetics from the University of Seville.
<br>She obtained a PhD. in molecular biology from the Autonomous
<br>University of Madrid. In 1992 she received an Executive MBA
<br>from the University of Navarre's Institute for Higher
<br>Business Studies (IESE). From 1992 to 2001, she worked in
<br>the business development area of the Group Amasua, a fishing
<br>industry group, leaving as executive vice president and
<br>financial director. In 2000 she was a co-founder of the
<br>medical biotechnology company Genetrix, the first company
<br>hat emerged from research work conducted by Spain's National
<br>Center for Biotechnology. She was president and CEO of
<br>Genetrix from 2000 to 2008. She has been president of
<br>several other biotechnology companies and is president of the
<br>board of the Inbiomed Foundation, which has the first bank of
<br>adult stem cells in Spain. From 2005 to 2008, she was
<br>president of the Association of Biotechnological Enterprises
<br>(ASEBIO). Since 2006, she has been a member of the board of
<br>directors of the Confederation of Business Organizations
<br>(CEOE) umbrella business chamber. She has served on several
<br>academic, hospital, and foundation boards, professional
<br>bodies, and prize juries. She serves on the board of the
<br>foundation of the Botin banking family, members of which
<br>control San Sebastian-based Banco Santander and Madrid-based
<br>Bankinter. In January 2008, she was awarded the "Golden
<br>Drum," San Sebastian's highest honor, for the positive
<br>contribution she has made to the image of the city.
<br>Garmendia was born February 21, 1962. She is married with
<br>four children. She has traveled to the U.S. on business
<br>frequently and speaks English.

<br>Beatriz Corredor (new)
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000552 010.2 OF 011
<br>
<br>
<br>Minister of Housing
<br>-----------------------------
<br>
<br>Beatriz Corredor replaces now-Defense Minister Carme Chacon
<br>as Housing Minister. Corredor is reported to be a political
<br>ally of new Minister of Industry, Tourism, and Commerce
<br>Miguel Sebastian. She obtained a law degree from the
<br>Autonomous University of Madrid in 1991 and passed the
<br>examinations to become a member of the Body of Registrars at
<br>a relatively young age in 1993. She has held office at land
<br>registries in Valencia de Alcantara, Caceres; Campillos,
<br>Malaga; and Lillo, Toledo. She has lectured on law at the
<br>Universities of Castile-La Mancha and Ciudad Real and has
<br>spoken at seminars on issues such as mortgage clauses and
<br>secondary mortgage markets. She was the first woman board
<br>member for the examination to become a Registrar. She joined
<br>the PSOE in 2003 and became the Madrid City Councilor for
<br>Housing in September 2007.
<br>
<br>As Housing Minister, Corredor will have to address the
<br>aftereffects of Spain's multi-year housing boom and its
<br>sudden end in 2007; both the high prices that have made
<br>housing expensive for many Spaniards and the rapid decline in
<br>housing construction. She will seek to implement efforts
<br>begun by Chacon -- who was only Minister for nine months --
<br>to make housing more affordable by providing income-tested
<br>subsidies to young renters by making it easier for property
<br>owners to evict tenants for nonpayment of rent. Corredor
<br>also will seek to increase the amount of housing built with
<br>public subsidies, which may be a way to help the many real
<br>estate and construction companies that are in financial
<br>difficulties.
<br>
<br>Corredor was born in Madrid in July 1968. She is married and
<br>has three daughters. She speaks and understands basic
<br>English but needs an interpreter for nearly all purposes.

<br>Bernat Soria Escoms
<br>Minister of Health and Consumption
<br>--------------------------
<br>
<br>Minister of Health since July 2007, Soria emphasized the
<br>importance of increasing Spanish research and development in
<br>his first term. Press reports indicate that in Zapatero's
<br>second administration, this aspect of his ministry's
<br>portfolio has been shifted to the new Ministry of Innovation
<br>and Technology.
<br>
<br>Soria is a medical doctor (University of Valencia) and a
<br>leading expert on stem cells. He has worked extensively in
<br>the U.S. and has a very positive image of the U.S. He

<br>physiology at Pablo de Olvide University in Alicante, and
<br>directed the Andalucian Center of Molecular Biology and
<br>Regenerative Medicine in Seville. From 2001-05, he conducted
<br>research in Singapore after the Health Ministry (during the
<br>Aznar government) opened a case against him for conducting
<br>research on stem cells acquired in the U.S. in apparent
<br>violation of Spanish law. He also has worked in laboratories
<br>in the UK, Belgium, Germany, and Switzerland, as well as the
<br>U.S. He has received many professional awards and presided
<br>over several professional societies. Born in Carlet,
