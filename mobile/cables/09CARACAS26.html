<br>POLITICAL HOT AIR 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Economic Counselor Darnall Steuart for reasons 1.4 
<br>(b) and (d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: In late 2008, Chavez once again made 
<br>statements regarding his plans to develop a nuclear power 
<br>program in Venezuela and went so far as to sign an agreement 
<br>with Russia's Rosatom on nuclear energy cooperation. Several 
<br>local nuclear physicists are skeptical arguing that nothing 
<br>came of the Venezuelan government's interest in nuclear power 
<br>in the 70's and nothing will come of it today. The 
<br>scientists argued the government has demonstrated little 
<br>interest in domestic nuclear research and the result has been 
<br>antiquated labs with only a handful of Venezuelan experts in 
<br>the field. Nevertheless, they did not discount the Chavez 
<br>Government's willingness to purchase a nuclear power plant 
<br>lock, stock and barrel from Russia if it could get the 
<br>financing, although they believe this unlikely given 
<br>Venezuela's looming economic crisis. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- -- 
<br>RUSSIAN CONSTRUCTION OF NUCLEAR PLANTS UNLIKELY 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) In November 2008, Chavez trumpeted that he had high 
<br>hopes for a nuclear reactor constructed with Russian 
<br>technology in the Venezuelan state of Zulia to be called the 
<br>"Huberto Fernandez Moran Nuclear Complex". On December 2, 
<br>Econoffs met with three scientists from Venezuela's only 
<br>fully functional nuclear physics research lab at public 
<br>University Simon Bolivar (USB). XXXXXXXXXXXX (strictly 
<br>protect throughout,) noted Chavez' recent statements on 
<br>nuclear power were reminiscent of those he made in 2005. 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX speculated that if Russia would offer Venezuela 
<br>enough credit for plant construction, Venezuela would be 
<br>happy to accept. XXXXXXXXXXXX, who after the 
<br>meeting identified himself as a Russian-educated scientist of 
<br>Cuban origin, added that the Russians are fully capable of 
<br>building adequate plants but they would take five to eight 
<br>years to complete and would cost billions of dollars. (Note: 
<br>Although the Director General of Rosatom State Nuclear 
<br>Energy Corporation signed an agreement to cooperate with 
<br>Venezuela on nuclear energy on November 26, international 
<br>press reports on December 8 indicated no Russian loans or 
<br>credits will be forthcoming for costly nuclear power projects 
<br>in part due to Venezuela's uncertain financial future. End 
<br>Note.) 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------- 
<br>VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT NOT SERIOUS ABOUT NUCLEAR POWER 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) The second in command at the lab, XXXXXXXXXXXX (strictly protect throughout,) said he has "heard this talk before in the 70's" when the government 
<br>was much more serious about developing a nuclear power 
<br>program and even went so far as to identify several potential 
<br>sites for hypothetical reactors. XXXXXXXXXXXX was adamant that 
<br>"nothing came of it then, and nothing will come of it now." 
<br>There is only sporadic interest in nuclear power in 
<br>Venezuela, which, he noted, is rational given that Venezuela 
<br>is a petroleum rich state. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX added that behind every nuclear power 
<br>project is a team of strong scientists. Unfortunately, he 
<br>said, Venezuelan politicians are not talking to the 
<br>scientists. He agreed that the current discussion of 
<br>developing a domestic nuclear energy program in Venezuela is 
<br>only talk, as there are no serious scientists involved and no 
<br>project is underway. Even if the government of the 
<br>Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (GBRV) were serious, he 
<br>said, it would take 10 to 15 years to make substantial 
<br>progress towards developing a nuclear energy program using 
<br>domestic resources. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX asserted that his lab at USB has the most 
<br>domestic expertise and would be the most likely talent pool 
<br>if the GBRV was in the market for government advisors or 
<br>program heads. He added that the GBRV had recently 
<br>approached him about serving as a government advisor on 
<br>nuclear power, but he had declined citing his workload. 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX said he hopes the government will tap the USB lab at 
<br>
<br>CARACAS 00000026 002 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>some point to spearhead nuclear power research, with the 
<br>accompanying funding, as he agrees with President Chavez on 
<br>Venezuela's need to diversify its energy sources. He noted 
<br>that his scientists are currently collaborating with the 
<br>National Experimental Politech University of the Bolivarian 
<br>Armed Forces, UNEFA, on developing a course, as the military 
<br>seems to have a new interest in giving its cadets a nuclear 
<br>physics background. (Note: XXXXXXXXXXXX is hopeful this 
<br>collaboration might translate into more funding for his lab, 
<br>which currently looks more like a museum than a functioning 
<br>research center. End Note.) 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- - 
<br>BARRIERS TO DEVELOPING A NUCLEAR POWER PROGRAM 
<br>--------------------------------------------- - 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) The scientists argued that the GBRV's failure to 
<br>support serious nuclear research has resulted in antiquated 
<br>labs, restrictive policies that inhibit academic research, 
<br>and a dearth of experts in the field. They also noted lack 
<br>of uranium as another limiting factor. In May 2005 when 
<br>Chavez announced his plans to start a nuclear energy program, 
<br>media reports at that time indicated that according to 
<br>government research in the 70's, there might be three 
<br>substantial uranium deposits in Venezuela. XXXXXXXXXXXX, however, 
<br>was firm in his assertion that Venezuela has little uranium. 
<br>His friend, respected Venezuelan geologist, often jokes with 
<br>him that "yes there is a uranium mine, but no one knows where 
<br>it is." XXXXXXXXXXXX added that Venezuela has thorium which can 
<br>be mixed with other radioactive materials and might someday 
<br>replace uranium in nuclear reactions. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) In addition to a lack of natural resources, XXXXXXXXXXXX said 
<br>there is also a severe deficiency in "manpower". He claimed 
<br>that all of the scientists in Venezuela capable of running or 
<br>even assisting with a nuclear power program were in the room. 
<br>(Three scientists were present). He said he knew perhaps 
<br>130 former students that had the academic credentials, but 
<br>almost all of them were "either selling shoes or building 
<br>shopping malls." He said the USB lab is now focusing more on 
<br>health diagnostics as there is a commercial interest in such 
<br>research. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX also implied he was not impressed with the 
<br>quality of the government's staff in the sector. XXXXXXXXXXXX is his 
<br>former student. XXXXXXXXXXXX. While 
<br>the Directorate has its own lab, XXXXXXXXXXXX said he has personally 
<br>verified that none of its equipment works. He noted that the 
<br>Directorate is a purely bureaucratic operation where 
<br>scientists do not conduct research but rather attend numerous 
<br>conferences abroad. When work needs done, the Directorate 
<br>will occasionally bring in experts and contract out research 
<br>projects. As an additional example of the government's 
<br>failures in the sector, he cited Venezuela's sole, and now 
<br>defunct, reactor at the GBRV's Venezuelan Institute for 
<br>Scientific Research (IVIC). USB, he said, carried off pieces 
<br>of the 1950's era reactor several years ago for student 
<br>experiments. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX finished his list of serious challenges facing 
<br>the development of a Venezuelan nuclear power program by 
<br>complaining about his inability to get permission from the 
<br>USG to obtain equipment or even data from the US. He said 
<br>the Venezuelan government is even more difficult to work with 
<br>as it will not give him licenses to import any radioactive 
<br>material. XXXXXXXXXXXX has consequently taken to bringing in 
<br>undeclared material in his pocket. He stated he flew in with 
<br>a "source" from California in this manner even though the 
<br>University warned him he could end up in jail. He ignored 
<br>the warning saying the Venezuelan government does not seem to 
<br>be particularly interested in the fact that all of the 
<br>radioactive material in the USB lab is currently illegal 
<br>under Venezuelan law. XXXXXXXXXXXX added that anything students 
<br>or professors do with the radioactive material is also 
<br>illegal. After 20 years of his best efforts, XXXXXXXXXXXX has yet 
<br>to get GBRV approval for radioactive material handling 
<br>regulations he wrote himself based on manuals he obtained 
<br>from the Imperial College of London and a US university. In 
<br>another "illegal" practice, XXXXXXXXXXXX said that his scientists 
<br>regularly go scavenging for radium from old Venezuelan 
<br>hospitals that they store on the USB campus.

<br>COMMENT 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) In spite of Chavez' grand public statements, the 
<br>academic community believes the GBRV continues to demonstrate 
<br>that it is uninterested in, or unable to develop a domestic 
<br>nuclear energy program. It has instead hamstrung the efforts 
<br>of the handful of its scientists with an interest in the 
<br>area. Scientists seem inclined to agree with a member of 
<br>Argentina's National Atomic Energy Commission who in 2005 was 
<br>quoted as saying "on a scale of zero to five, nuclear power 
<br>development within Venezuela does not reach one. It is not 
<br>only behind Brazil and Argentina, it is also behind Chile, 
<br>Mexico and Peru." Nevertheless, the USB scientists seemed 
<br>confident that if Venezuela one day finds a country willing 
<br>to sell its technology on credit, however unlikely given 
<br>Venezuela's looming financial trouble, the GBRV would be more 
<br>than willing to buy. Regardless of whether or not nuclear 
<br>power plants make sense in a petroleum rich country, high 
<br>profile projects that give the rest of the world cause for 
<br>concern hold a certain appeal for Chavez.
