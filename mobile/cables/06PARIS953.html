<br>
<br>Classified By: Political Minister-Counselor Josiah Rosenblatt for reaso 
<br>ns 1.4 (b) and (d) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: EUR Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary 
<br>Kurt Volker reviewed on February 3 with Patrick Devedjian, a 
<br>former industry minister and key advisor to Interior Minister 
<br>Sarkozy, how a possible Sarkozy administration would likely 
<br>approach relations with the U.S. Devedjian said a Sarkozy 
<br>administration would make "economic gestures" in connection 
<br>with the reconstruction of Iraq to signal -- as much as 
<br>domestic French opinion would allow -- France's more active 
<br>association with U.S. goals in the region. Devedjian 
<br>acknowledged that a Sarkozy victory in 2007 is far from a 
<br>sure thing, while discounting Prime Minister de Villepin's 
<br>chances of pushing Sarkozy aside as leader of the 
<br>center-right governing party. Devedjian acknowledged that 
<br>the unexpectedly persistent popularity of Socialist Party 
<br>(PS) dark horse Segolene Royal (ref A) was an unforeseen 
<br>development that is forcing contenders of both left and right 
<br>to revisit their electoral calculations, even if he did not 
<br>believe she could win in the end. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>WHAT TO EXPECT FROM A SARKOZY ADMINISTRATION 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br>¶2. (C) "We will make economic gestures with regard to the 
<br>Iraq situation" is how Devedjian expressed what would be a 
<br>new French willingness, under a Sarkozy administration, to 
<br>more actively support U.S. goals in Iraq. Devedjian, evoking 
<br>the strand of anti-Americanism that persists in France and 
<br>the widespread public hostility to the U.S.-led invasion of 
<br>Iraq, cautioned however that how much France might be able to 
<br>do along these lines depended on what would be "politically 
<br>possible" at the time. Devedjian did not specify what those 
<br>"economic gestures" might be. Comment: Increases in 
<br>development aid and, possibly further debt forgiveness, could 
<br>be what he had in mind. End Commentg. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Devedjian used the phrase "Atlanticist and 
<br>communitarian" to describe Sarkozy's overall outlook, and to 
<br>distinguish it from that of Villepin, which is often 
<br>described as "nationalist and Republican." Devedjian 
<br>underlined that "we will not be ceding to an anti-American 
<br>campaign," notwithstanding the efforts of Sarkozy's opponents 
<br>to try and tar Sarkozy as pro-American. Devedjian made clear 
<br>that not only would the Sarkozy campaign not engage in any 
<br>outbidding of the opposition in anti-Americanism, but that it 
<br>would also make every effort to avoid "bringing the U.S. into 
<br>our domestic politics." 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) In response to PDAS Volker's hope that, at NATO, a 
<br>Sarkozy victory might result in useful, operationally 
<br>consequential changes in French behavior, Devedjian lamented 
<br>that the French press and public "are not interested in 
<br>NATO." This has permitted President Chirac, he said, to 
<br>conduct French policy in NATO beyond public scrutiny, without 
<br>accountability for the consequences. Devedjian suggested 
<br>that French institutional reforms proposed by Sarkozy, 
<br>specifically, an NSC-like coordinating mechanism for foreign 
<br>policy and periodic reports by the president to the 
<br>parliament on current issues, could have the effect of 
<br>bringing France's NATO policy out of the shadows. This might 
<br>eventually lead to a more positive appreciation of NATO's 
<br>role by the French public. 
<br>
<br>LONG, UNCERTAIN ROAD TO 2007 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>¶5. (C) Getting to a Sarkozy administration in 2007, as 
<br>Devedjian soberly acknowledged, was far from a foregone 
<br>conclusion. Devedjian believed that Sarkozy's "type of 
<br>leadership" -- "the hands-on leadership" seen in Sarkozy's 
<br>successful, personal management of the security response to 
<br>the urban unrest that swept France last fall, along with the 
<br>"rupture" with past practice advocated by Sarkozy -- are what 
<br>the French people truly want. Devedjian specified that by 
<br>"rupture with the past," Sarkozy primarily means slimming 
<br>down a bloated and pervasive state that stifles growth by 
<br>taking too big a share of national wealth and which 
<br>undermines individual initiative and commercial innovation by 
<br>over-regulation of business activity. Devedjian underlined 
<br>that voters want "renewal," and he musingly volunteered that 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00000953 002 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>"Sarkozy on the right, and Segolene (Royal) on the left" were 
<br>"the two candidates that would most respond to this desire 
<br>for change." 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Devedjian confidently dismissed the possibility of 
<br>Prime Minister de Villepin mounting a successful campaign to 
<br>replace Sarkozy as the candidate of the center-right in 2007. 
<br>Devedjian said that "Villepin and Sarkozy are in agreement" 
<br>that some sort of primary process should decide a single 
<br>nominee for their party, the UMP. Devedjian observed that 
<br>Villepin won't challenge Sarkozy for control of the party so 
<br>long as Sarkozy clearly benefits from both firm command of 
<br>the party and a healthy public image. He added that Villepin 
<br>"has always counted on Sarkozy's self-destruction -- which 
<br>he's been counting on in vain since 2002." Devedjian alluded 
<br>to Villepin's view that Sarkozy's personality -- somehow, not 
<br>presidential -- would in the long run work to shift the 
<br>support of the center-right to Villepin. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Turning to the potential opposition to Sarkozy on the 
<br>center-left, Devedjian clucked at the long-running, confused 
<br>contentiousness in the Socialist Party (PS) over both who 
<br>will lead the party and what the party will stand for in 
<br>¶2007. In Devedjian's view, neither Party First Secretary 
<br>Francois Hollande nor any of the party's mainstream figures 
<br>are likely to make compelling candidates. Asked to assess 
<br>the option for the socialists of "bringing back Jospin" -- 
<br>that is, unifying the divided PS under former Prime Minister 
<br>Lionel Jospin -- Devedjian declared that "Jospin isn't the 
<br>future, he's the past -- and that's not what voters are 
<br>looking for." As for the popular President of the 
<br>Poitou-Charentes Region, Segolene Royal, Devedjian said that, 
<br>despite her appeal to voters wanting change, "Segolene has no 
<br>chance" of winning the PS nomination. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Devedjian pointed out that Royal had in preceding 
<br>days made statements in support of "Blairist" policies to 
<br>address some of France's economic problems. "The only other 
<br>Blairists in the PS are Kouchner and Bockel," Devedjian 
<br>summed up. (Note and comment: Former Health Minster Bernard 
<br>Kouchner and Mayor of Mulhouse Jean-Marie Bockel are the PS's 
<br>most outspoken "liberals." Adoption of anything resembling 
<br>their views is out of the question for the vast majority of 
<br>PS party members. Even so, Devedjian's inference is 
<br>disingenuous -- Royal is exceedingly popular among party 
<br>members. End note and comment.) Reflecting on how Royal's 
<br>popularity -- the emergence of her candidacy as a potentially 
<br>serious one -- has upset the calculations of contenders on 
<br>both left and right, Devedjian joked, "Now that she's wound 
<br>up and going, even Francois Hollande must realize she's not 
<br>going to quit at his, or anybody else's say so." (Note: 
<br>Royal and Hollande have been domestic partners for over 20 
<br>years. End Note.) Devedjian reprised the familiar refrain 
<br>that Royal's personality, allegedly both disagreeable and 
<br>brittle, is not up to carrying the weight of the presidency. 
<br>Implying that this unfitness for the job would become evident 
<br>in due time, Devedjian said that "Everybody who knows her 
<br>knows it, Francois Hollande most of all." 
<br>
<br>PARTICIPANTS 
<br>------------ 
<br>¶9. (SBU) Devejian was accompanied by the UMP's Director for 
<br>International Affairs, Pascal Drouhaut and a staff assistant, 
<br>Marie-Celie Guillaume. PDAS Volker was accompanied by POl 
<br>M-C and PolOff. Devedjian and Volker parted agreeing to stay 
<br>in touch -- in particular, should Devedjian, Drouhaut or 
<br>other Sarkozy advisors travel to Washington in the near 
<br>future. 
<br>
<br>SARKOZY'S ADVISORS 
<br>------------------ 
<br>¶10. (C) Sarkozy's inner circle of political allies and 
<br>advisors consists of Francois Fillon, Brice Hortefeux and 
<br>Patrick Devedjian. Hortefeux is currently Junior Minister 
<br>(for Territorial Collectivities) under Sarkozy at the 
<br>Interior Ministry. Fillon and Devedjian, who were members of 
<br>the government of Jean-Pierre Rafferin, were excluded from 
<br>the current Villepin government precisely because of their 
<br>closeness to Sarkozy. Under Rafferin, Fillon was Minister of 
<br>Education and Devedjian was Junior Minister for Industry. 
<br>Both now have positions in the UMP, and devote themselves 
<br>full-time to making Nicholas Sarkozy the next president of 
<br>France. Fillon tends to take the lead in the fashioning of 
<br>Sarkozy's policy proposals, while Devedjian tends to focus on 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00000953 003 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>tactics for countering other contenders and on strategy for 
<br>getting the votes to win. Fillon is considered a likely 
<br>candidate for prime minister, with Devedjian at Justice or 
<br>Interior, should Sarkozy win in 2007.
