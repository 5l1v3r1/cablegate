<br>SUBJECT: Morales Continues to Attempt to Derail Copenhagen Accord
<br>
<br>CLASSIFIED BY: John S. Creamer, Charge d'Affaires, DOS, La Paz;
<br>REASON: 1.4(B), (D)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Declaring the Copenhagen UN
<br>climate change summit a failure, Bolivian President Morales
<br>announced he will convoke the first "People's World Conference on
<br>Climate Change and the Mother Earth" in Cochabamba April 20-22 --
<br>coinciding with Earth Day. The conference's stated objective is to
<br>improve the position of social movements in the climate change
<br>process and develop an alternative work plan to take to the United
<br>Nations. As one of only five countries that did not sign the
<br>Copenhagen Accord (besides Tuvalu, Venezuela, Sudan, and Cuba), the
<br>Bolivian government hopes to raise doubts about the ability of the
<br>UN process to advance the climate change agenda and address the
<br>concerns of the world's poorest nations. More fundamentally,
<br>Morales views climate change as a vehicle for raising his and
<br>Bolivia's international political stature, especially among
<br>sympathetic anti-globalization groups. End summary.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) President Morales seemed to revel in his
<br>high-profile opposition to the UN process at the Copenhagen summit,
<br>ridiculing developed nations' proposals, making extraordinary
<br>demands for reparations and aid, and alienating the conference
<br>organizers and most delegations. Danish Ambassador to Bolivia
<br>Morten Elkjaer told us Morales canceled most of his bilateral
<br>program at the last moment, including meetings with clean energy
<br>firms, sustainable energy experts, and leading Danish businesses
<br>and labor federations. Danish Prime Minister Rasmussen spent an
<br>unpleasant 30 minutes with Morales, Ambassador Elkjaer said, during
<br>which Morales thanked him for bilateral aid (Denmark provides
<br>Bolivia approximately $30 million a year in aid), but refused to
<br>engage on climate change issues. The Danes said they are "fed up"
<br>with Bolivia and the ALBA countries, who continue to mount legal
<br>and propaganda arguments against the Copenhagen Accord, but that
<br>they will continue to consult with their European Union partners on
<br>ways to influence the GOB position.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Chinese DCM in La Paz, Huang Yazhong,
<br>told the Charge that he has raised the Copenhagen Accord twice with
<br>Bolivian MFA Multilateral Affairs director MarC-a Cecilia ChacC3n,
<br>urging the GOB to rethink its radical opposition to the deal.
<br>Noting he had made little progress, the Chinese diplomat suggested
<br>that further engagement was pointless and argued that it is up to
<br>Brazil to bring around Bolivia and the other ALBA countries.
<br>Brazilian officials told us Bolivia refused to adopt Brazil's
<br>position on Copenhagen at a November 26 meeting in Manaus organized
<br>by President Lula da Silva. Still, Itamaraty official Marcel Biato
<br>(and future Brazilian Ambassador to La Paz) said Brazil will
<br>continue to press Bolivia on Copenhagen, hoping that Bolivia's
<br>isolation on this issue will eventually bring it around.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Gisela Ulloa, a member of Bolivian
<br>delegations to earlier COP meetings (but not COP-15, where she
<br>represented Papua New Guinea and the Coalition for First Nations)
<br>told us the GOB's position is aimed at creating an alternative
<br>development model consistent with Morales's anti-capitalist
<br>philosophy. In addition to demanding enormous reparations from
<br>developed nations, the GOB opposes using markets as a mechanism to
<br>reduce emissions. Ulloa suggested that Morales recognizes Bolivia
<br>will not be included in the deliberations of the major players and
<br>is keen to create an alternative forum where he can style himself
<br>as the leader of anti-globalization groups and other social
<br>movements MAS Senator Ana Maria Romero added that Morales sees
<br>environmental issues as one area where he can carve out an
<br>international identity independent from that of his close ally,
<br>President Hugo Chavez. She recounted to us that an animated
<br>Morales told her he was surrounded by well-wishers in Copenhagen
<br>urging him "not to abandon them," while Chavez was alone in the
<br>corner.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Many Bolivians are quick to observe that
<br>Morales's climate change campaign is about enhancing his global
<br>stature, not about the environment. Former Morales Production
<br>Minister and MAS replacement (suplente) Senator Javier Hurtado said
<br>there is a huge gap between Morales' strident, pro-environmental
<br>rhetoric in international fora and his domestic emphasis on
<br>industrialization as they key to development. The foundation of
<br>this effort is large-scale natural gas, iron, and lithium
<br>production projects, enterprises that have historically proven
<br>extremely damaging to the environment. In fact, the Inter-American
<br>
<br>Development Bank has presented a report to the GOB that details the
<br>serious potential for environmental damage in extracting lithium.
<br>
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Comment: Bolivia is already suffering
<br>real damage from the effects of global warming, but Morales seems
<br>to prefer to score rhetorical points rather than contribute to a
<br>solution. This radical position won him plaudits from
<br>anti-globalization groups, but has alienated many developed nations
<br>and most of Bolivia's neighbors .. Our assessment is that Bolivia
<br>remains beyond reach on Copenhagen, at least until Morales sees the
<br>limits of his approach. End comment.
