<br> 
<br>Classified By: Classified by Political M-C George Glass for reasons 1.4 
<br> (b,d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (C) German FM Westerwelle told Amb February 5 that it was 
<br>important to refocus Afghanistan efforts on civilian 
<br>reconstruction; that we needed to avoid suggesting German 
<br>troops engaged in less risk than other countries; that he did 
<br>not invite Iranian FM Mottaki to Germany or seek a meeting 
<br>with him; that any discussion of non-strategic nuclear 
<br>weapons needed to be conducted at 28 at NATO; and that he 
<br>could not influence any decision by the European Parliament 
<br>on the SWIFT agreement.  END SUMMARY. 
<br>¶2.  (C) The Ambassador asked about Westerwelle's first 100 
<br>days in office.  Though in an ebullient mood, Westerwelle 
<br>said things were very difficult (FDP slipped another 
<br>percentage point in the polls hours before the meeting).  He 
<br>said he had been in France February 4 for a joint cabinet 
<br>meeting, but that nothing substantive came of it.  He 
<br>observed that one never really knew what was going to happen 
<br>with Sarkozy involved. 
<br> 
<br>-------------- 
<br>AFGHANISTAN 
<br>------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C) The Ambassador reviewed his own recent trip to 
<br>Afghanistan.  He shared his impression that the Germans were 
<br>doing a superb job at all levels from the RC-North commander 
<br>on down.  He learned how critical mentoring and partnering 
<br>with Afghan security forces had become.  He noted that the 
<br>U.S. was sending substantial forces to RC-North, where they 
<br>would conduct training and be under German command. 
<br>Westerwelle responded that this was important for Germany and 
<br>for international cooperation.  The Ambassador added that the 
<br>U.S. was sending substantial helicopter support as well.  He 
<br>said that Germans could be proud of their troops in 
<br>Afghanistan.  Westerwelle responded that this was good news. 
<br>He said that the London Conference bore an excellent 
<br>conclusion, and was particularly useful for its focus on 
<br>civilian progress.  He emphasized the importance of 
<br>underscoring civilian reconstruction. 
<br>¶4.  (C) With a request for confidentiality, Westerwelle 
<br>referred to the January 20 "Bild Zeitung" interview with 
<br>General McChrystal, in which the general is quoted as urging 
<br>the Germans to take more risks.  Westerwelle recounted that 
<br>he himself had had to answer questions about this article for 
<br>ten days, explaining that the Germans were not "peace 
<br>soldiers" while  other countries provided the combat troops. 
<br>He said it was important that German troops not be 
<br>"relativized" and cast as second-class troops.  He observed 
<br>that Germany had originally deployed 3,500 troops, increased 
<br>that mandate to 4,500, and was now planning an increase of 
<br>another 500 plus a reserve.  He emphasized that this was a 
<br>major contribution compared with other European countries. 
<br>¶5.  (C) The Ambassador noted that he had gained the 
<br>impression in Afghanistan that police training was more 
<br>challenging than he had originally understood.  Troops were 
<br>usually required to provide force protection.  But German 
<br>police training was the best. 
<br>¶6.  (C) The Ambassador asked how the prospective February 26 
<br>Bundestag debate to extend the Bundeswehr mandate in 
<br>Afghanistan would play out.  Westerwelle said the question 
<br>was how large a majority would approve the new mandate.  He 
<br>said that SPD caucus chief Steinmeier displayed good will on 
<br>this issue.  However, SPD chairman Gabriel wanted to 
<br>politicize the issue for domestic political gain. 
<br>Nevertheless, he thought some in the SPD would support the 
<br>new mandate.  However, Westerwelle expected no support from 
<br>the Greens.  Westerwelle noted that the May NRW state 
<br>elections were also affecting the issue in a negative way. 
<br>That said, he said he could not see Steinmeier opposing the 
<br>larger mandate.  He hoped the Ambassador would speak with 
<br>Steinmeier. 
<br> 
<br>------ 
<br>IRAN 
<br>------ 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (C) Asked about the February 5 visit of Iranian FM 
<br>Mottaki to the Munich Security Conference, Westerwelle 
<br>emphasized that he (Westerwelle) had not invited Mottaki to 
<br>come to Germany, and Westerwelle had also not requested a 
<br>meeting with Mottaki.  Rather, it was Mottaki who was asking 
<br>to see Westerwelle.  Westerwelle said he had still not 
<br>decided whether he would talk to Mottaki or not.  He 
<br>reflected concern that Tehran might try to exploit Mottaki's 
<br>visit to Germany as a distraction, and continue executing 
<br>people during the visit.  In any case, Westerwelle said his 
<br>position was exactly the same as the U.S. on Iran, and he 
<br>would share the results of any meeting with Mottaki, if it 
<br>took place. 
<br> 
<br>BERLIN 00000164  002 OF 002 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (C) Westerwelle said he would meet Russian FM Lavrov and 
<br>(separately) Chinese FM Yang February 5.  He suggested that 
<br>Moscow had been changing course on Iran sanctions since the 
<br>Qom revelations.  The Russians now saw Iran as playing games 
<br>on the nuclear issue.  However, he observed that China was 
<br>"hesitant," or even in opposition to sanctions.  Reflecting 
<br>on his recent visit to China, Westerwelle said he had not 
<br>perceived any "good will" there at present.  He said he would 
<br>ask Yang again about Iran and then share the results with the 
<br>U.S.  Westerwelle opined that it was important also to focus 
<br>on Brazil as an opinion leader in the Third World.  He noted 
<br>that President Lula had received Ahmadinejad warmly several 
<br>months ago.  He added that he was uncertain what the Saudis 
<br>thought, but that the other Persian Gulf countries seemed to 
<br>be in an existential panic about the Iranian nuclear program. 
<br> 
<br>----------- 
<br>TAC NUKES 
<br>----------- 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (C) Touching briefly on arms control, Westerwelle stated 
<br>unequivocally that tactical nuclear weapons was an issue for 
<br>NATO.  He said that when he had received Kissinger, Schulz, 
<br>Perry and Nunn on February 3 to talk about their global zero 
<br>proposal, tactical nuclear weapons was not discussed.  He 
<br>said that the four statesmen were very supportive of 
<br>President Obama. 
<br> 
<br>---------- 
<br>TFTP 
<br>--------- 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (C) The Ambassador raised the challenge of getting the 
<br>European Parliament to approve an agreement to share data 
<br>with the U.S. on tracking terrorist finance.  The Ambassador 
<br>noted the extensive efforts of the Treasury Department and 
<br>other U.S. agencies to explain the importance of the program 
<br>to our common security.  He asked how one could get better 
<br>support for the program.  Westerwelle replied that the German 
<br>government had been able to come up with a solution for 
<br>itself a few months ago when the issue first surfaced. 
<br>(Comment: In fact, German Interior Minister de Maziere's vote 
<br>to abstain in the EU Council vote on TFTP on November 30 
<br>reflected the complete deadlock within the Coalition 
<br>Government between TFTP advocates in the CDU-controlled 
<br>Interior Ministry and TFTP opponents in the FDP-controlled 
<br>Justice Ministery. End Comment.) However, Westerwelle said 
<br>that now that the issue was in the European Parliament, he 
<br>had no ability to influence it.  He said that he was very, 
<br>very aware of the Secretary's interest in this issue. 
<br>Nevertheless, he had a sense that almost all groups in the 
<br>European Parliament had concerns with the proposed agreement. 
<br> He emphasized that this was not an issue that only concerned 
<br>his party, the FDP, but rather many others as well. 
<br>¶11. (C) Westerwelle shared that he had not yet appointed a 
<br>new Coordinator for German-American cooperation. 
<br> 
<br>---------- 
<br>COMMENT 
<br>--------- 
<br> 
<br>¶12.  (C) Westerwelle (who spoke with ease in English) was in 
<br>a buoyant mood and more confident on his issues than we have 
<br>seen him so far.  He seemed ready to defend any intimation 
<br>that he was less than supportive of a troop surge (Defense 
<br>Minister zu Guttenberg told the Ambassador two days ago that 
<br>Westerwelle had worked for no increase of German troops for 
<br>Afghanistan, see Berlin 157) with invocations of the 
<br>importance of civilian reconstruction.  On Iran, he leapt at 
<br>the chance to tell us he had not invited Mottaki.  His dodges 
<br>on both tactical nuclear weapons and terrorist finance were 
<br>all but practiced.  His comment that he was unable to affect 
<br>the vote in the EU Parliament on TFTP was a bit disingenuous; 
<br>on February 4, an MFA official acknowledged to visiting 
<br>Treasury officials in Berlin that German MEPs were in fact 
<br>leading the charge against TFTP in the EU Parliament with the 
<br>tacit support of the FDP, if not of specialists in the 
<br>Justice Ministry and MFA themselves. Westerwelle still cuts a 
<br>good image in meetings and in the press here, even though his 
<br>party continues a bout of free fall in the polls.  His 
<br>ministry, though, still wonders (privately to us) where he 
<br>gets his policy direction from.  END COMMENT. 
<br>¶13.  (U) The Ambassador did not have the chance to clear this 
<br>cable before departing Berlin.
