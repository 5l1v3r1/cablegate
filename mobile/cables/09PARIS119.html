<br>SUBJECT: FRANCE SEEKING COORDINATED EU POSITION AS 
<br>PREREQUISITE TO ACCEPTANCE OF GUANTANAMO DETAINEES ON A 
<br>"CASE BY CASE" BASIS 
<br>
<br>REF: A. SECSTATE 6516 
<br>¶B. BRUSSELS 79 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Political Counselor Andrew R. Young for reasons 1.4 (B & 
<br>D). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C/NF) Summary: In response to President Obama's January 
<br>22 Executive Order to close detention facilities at 
<br>Guantanamo Bay Naval Base (ref a), the French have publicly 
<br>given their support to at least review the idea of accepting 
<br>detainees deemed not to be a security risk. Foreign Minister 
<br>Bernard Kouchner said on January 20 and again on January 26 
<br>that France "would consider positively" requests from 
<br>Washington to accept detainees from Guantanamo who wish to 
<br>come to France, on a "case-by-case basis, with a specific and 
<br>careful assessment of legal implications and security risks." 
<br>Philippe Errera, Advisor to Foreign Minister Kouchner, and 
<br>French Foreign Ministry DAS-equivalent for security issues 
<br>Martin Juillard said France prefers to have a coordinated EU 
<br>position before moving forward on the issue. Errera said the 
<br>goal is to bring the discussion to a political level, perhaps 
<br>headed by EU Counterterrorism Coordinator Gilles de Kerchove, 
<br>in an effort to give broad political and legal cover to those 
<br>states wishing to accept detainees. Juillard said it is 
<br>unlikely the EU will provide a plan or a framework for 
<br>accepting detainees unless the USG makes an official request 
<br>to the EU presidency, now led by the Czech Republic. While 
<br>the French are eager to improve relations with the U.S. on 
<br>counter-terrorism, Juillard said the GOF wants two conditions 
<br>met: first, the U.S. must agree to resettle some of these 
<br>same low-risk detainees in the U.S., and; second, any 
<br>detainee being considered for resettlement in France must 
<br>express an explicit desire to be resettled in France. 
<br>Julliard noted a final decision on the matter would 
<br>ultimately rest with President Sarkozy. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) Pol MC met with Philippe Errera, Strategic Affairs 
<br>Advisor to FM Kouchner, on January 26. Poloffs met with 
<br>French MFA DAS-equivalent for security issues Martin Juillard 
<br>on January 27. MFA security directorate officers 
<br>Jean-Mathieu Bonnel and Caroline Monvoisin, as well as North 
<br>America desk officer Bruno Asseray joined Juillard.

<br>
<br>Common EU Position Sought That Would Permit Decisions by 
<br>Individual Member States

<br>
<br>¶3. (C/NF) In response to President Obama's January 22 
<br>Executive Order to close detention facilities at Guantanamo 
<br>Bay Naval Base (ref a), the French have publicly given their 
<br>support to at least review the idea of accepting detainees 
<br>deemed not to be a security risk. Foreign Minister Bernard 
<br>Kouchner said on January 20 and again on January 26 that 
<br>France "would consider positively" requests from Washington 
<br>to accept detainees from Guantanamo who wish to come to 
<br>France, on a "case-by-case basis, with a specific and careful 
<br>assessment of legal implications and security risks." 
<br>Philippe Errera, Advisor to Foreign Minister Kouchner, and 
<br>Foreign Affairs DAS-equivalent for security issues Martin 
<br>Juillard said France is working to obtain a common EU 
<br>position on Guantanamo, although decisions about accepting 
<br>detainees would remain with the individual member states. 
<br>Errera said the goal is to bring the discussion to a 
<br>political level, perhaps headed by EU Counterterrorism 
<br>Coordinator Gilles de Kerchove, in an effort to give broad 
<br>political and legal cover to those states wishing to accept 
<br>detainees. Errera noted that this was also necessary on a 
<br>practical level because members of the Schengen group of 
<br>countries must coordinate any such decision inasmuch as any 
<br>individual within their borders would be able to travel 
<br>freely to all of the other participating states. Errera said 
<br>that FM Kouchner was "more forward-leaning" on this issue, 
<br>but that they had been surprised by the harsh public reaction 
<br>across Europe to the idea of accepting "terrorists" on their 
<br>soil. Paris believes that a common EU position would provide 
<br>a broad framework for individual country action, just as it 
<br>did in an earlier case involving the relocation of 
<br>Palestinian fighters who had taken over the Church of the 
<br>Nativity in Bethlehem. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C/NF) Furthering Errera's point from January 26, 
<br>Juillard noted that while the French believe it is necessary 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00000119 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>to have a common EU clearing house to accept detainees, they 
<br>do not want to create a large bureaucracy that will prevent 
<br>flexibility in the process. Poloffs emphasized that 
<br>flexibility was a key factor and hoped France and the EU 
<br>would not support a process that would prevent interested 
<br>countries from taking detainees. Juillard said it is 
<br>unlikely that France would make a final determination on 
<br>their ability to accept detainees without some type of 
<br>process in place at the EU level. He also noted it is 
<br>unlikely the EU would provide a plan or a framework for 
<br>accepting detainees unless the USG makes an official request 
<br>to the EU presidency, now led by the Czech Republic. 
<br>
<br>
<br>EU Acceptance Conditional 
<br>------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C/NF) While the French are open to the idea of accepting 
<br>those detainees who, according to U.S. authorities, do not 
<br>pose a security risk, the French believe it is necessary for 
<br>two requirements to be met: first, the U.S. must agree to 
<br>resettle some of these same low-risk detainees in the U.S., 
<br>and; second, any detainee being considered for resettlement 
<br>in France must express an explicit desire to be resettled in 
<br>France. Julliard noted that a final decision on the matter 
<br>rests at the presidential level with the advice of the 
<br>Ministers of Foreign affairs and the interior. 
<br>
<br>
<br>No EU States Opposed, But Still No Consensus 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C/NF) Juillard said there were no indications that EU 
<br>members were blocking the idea of taking former detainees. 
<br>However, some countries have stated flatly they would not be 
<br>taking any Guantanamo detainees. 
<br>
<br>
<br>Desire to Improve Franco-American Relations 
<br>------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C/NF) Juillard noted on three separate occasions that 
<br>part of France's calculation on the detainee issue is how 
<br>they can support the Obama Administration in a hope of 
<br>improving Franco-American relations. He continued that the 
<br>Franco-American counter-terrorism relationship was so far 
<br>good, but there was vast room for improvement and he hoped we 
<br>would work more closely in the coming months. Juillard was 
<br>quick to point out that at the end of their EU presidency in 
<br>December of last year, the French put forth the idea that the 
<br>EU should be considering the detainee issue which finally 
<br>took place on January 26.
