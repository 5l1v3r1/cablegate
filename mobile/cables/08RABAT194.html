<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Thomas T. Riley for reason 1.4 (b, c, and d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) SUMMARY: On February 25, Director General for 
<br>Studies and Documentation (DGED) Mohamed Yassine Mansouri 
<br>(the Moroccan equivalent of the Director of the Central 
<br>Intelligence Agency) and NEA Assistant Secretary David Welch 
<br>and his party had a cordial and frank two-hour exchange on 
<br>regional issues, working their way from east to west. Welch 
<br>explained U.S. plans to maintain and strengthen Lebanese 
<br>institutions. He described Syria's unhelpful role in both 
<br>Lebanon and in the Middle East Peace Process (MEPP), with 
<br>Mansouri noting that Syria has begun to realize that the 
<br>foreign fighters might threaten its own internal security. 
<br>Welch updated Mansouri on the MEPP, and Mansouri replied that 
<br>he and Foreign Minister Fassi Fihri had met Israeli Foreign 
<br>Minister Livni. Mansouri predicted a "monarchical 
<br>succession" in Egypt. He said Libya continued to blame Saudi 
<br>Wahabism for the region's terrorism problem. He expressed 
<br>concern about rapacity and brittleness in Tunisia. Mansouri 
<br>said that Algeria's terrorism problem was returning as 
<br>Al-Qaeda focused more on North Africa; yet Bouteflika flatly 
<br>refused to participate in an AMU security summit. 
<br>Ambassadors Welch and Riley urged Morocco to stick with the 
<br>diplomatic track to resolve the Western Sahara dispute and 
<br>said diplomatic support for Morocco's autonomy proposal was 
<br>growing. Mansouri ended the tour with a plea for greater 
<br>U.S. assistance to Mauritania. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>SYRIA AND LEBANON 
<br>----------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) With the Syrian Foreign Minister coming to Morocco on 
<br>February 26, Ambassador Welch inquired about Syria's 
<br>cooperation with Morocco. Mansouri said that while it was 
<br>not all that Morocco desired, it has improved in the last few 
<br>months. Welch said the Syrians have recognized that the 
<br>foreign fighter pipeline may pose a risk to their own 
<br>country. However, Syria continued to exert a great deal of 
<br>pressure on Lebanon and appeared determined to maintain its 
<br>interests in Lebanon at any cost. Prior to the Annapolis 
<br>conference, Syria had been relatively quiet vis-a-vis the 
<br>Palestinians. However, three or four weeks ago, it hosted 
<br>the conference of rejectionists. Damascus has lost the 
<br>support of many Arab friends, and the Arab League Summit is 
<br>insufficient incentive to achieve better behavior. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) A/S Welch asked how Lebanon could be a threat to 
<br>Syria; yet Syria is bent on destroying Lebanese institutions, 
<br>i.e., the government, the army, and the central bank. As a 
<br>result, the United States was increasing its assistance to 
<br>Lebanon, working in tandem with Germany, France, the United 
<br>Kingdom, and other friends. Mansouri interjected that Saudi 
<br>Arabia, Jordan and Egypt's positions had evolved. Welch 
<br>noted that family, intelligence, and business are all one in 
<br>Syria. He ended that portion of the discussion by stressing 
<br>U.S. support for a political solution and a short-term focus 
<br>on maintaining and strengthening Lebanese institutions. 
<br>
<br>ISRAEL AND THE MEPP 
<br>------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) Turning to Israel, Welch said that the good news was 
<br>real albeit unseen. He assured Mansouri that the 
<br>Israeli-Palestinian talks were addressing all issues and were 
<br>making progress. He told Mansouri that the Secretary and 
<br>then the President intend to return to the region. More Arab 
<br>financial assistance to the Palestinian Authority would be 
<br>helpful. Mansouri said that he and Foreign Minister Taieb 
<br>Fassi Fihri had met Israeli Foreign Minister Livni and found 
<br>
<br>RABAT 00000194 002 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>her serious. 
<br>
<br>GAZA AND EGYPT 
<br>-------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) The conversation then turned to Gaza and Egypt. 
<br>Ambassador Welch noted that the GOE had contained 300,000 
<br>Palestinians within the Sinai after they spilled across the 
<br>frontier. Meanwhile, Hamas was not using funds it received 
<br>from Iran to improve the humanitarian situation. Asked about 
<br>the expected transition in Egypt, Mansouri agreed that the 
<br>army would not control the next transition. He nonetheless 
<br>expected a "monarchical succession." 
<br>
<br>THE MAGHREB 
<br>----------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Moving west, Mansouri said Morocco and Libya enjoyed 
<br>very good relations and agreed on many regional issues. 
<br>Mansouri noted that Libya continues to believe that Saudi 
<br>Wahabism is the source of terrorism in the region. Welch 
<br>acknowledged that Libyan-U.S. relations are currently 
<br>strained due to historical disputes. Mansouri was surprised 
<br>when Welch expressed concern about Tunisia. Mansouri said 
<br>Morocco is quite concerned about the greed and brittleness of 
<br>the Ben Ali regime. Mansouri added that the December 
<br>2006/January 2007 events had scared the GOT. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Continuing the westward progression, Mansouri 
<br>declared that Algeria's terror problem was returning, as 
<br>Al-Qaeda focused on North Africa to offset reverses in Iraq 
<br>and Afghanistan. He said that even though senior Algerians 
<br>refuse to come to Rabat, Moroccans go there. Mansouri said 
<br>that Morocco has tried everything to improve bilateral 
<br>relations. He noted that while counterterrorism cooperation 
<br>must work, President Abdelaziz Bouteflika had recently 
<br>completely rejected a Tunisian initiative to organize a 
<br>security summit of Arab Maghreb Union (AMU) members. 
<br>
<br>WESTERN SAHARA 
<br>-------------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Mansouri told Welch and party that Algeria's internal 
<br>problems did not prevent a solution to the Western Sahara 
<br>dispute. He expressed some concern that generational change 
<br>in Algiers might complicate a solution, declaring that the 
<br>older generation had created the problem and was best placed 
<br>to solve it. Mansouri said the GOM is "very worried about 
<br>the POLISARIO moving into the area east of the berm." 
<br>Ambassador Welch then launched into a long discussion of U.S. 
<br>support for Morocco,s autonomy proposal and for a diplomatic 
<br>solution. Both he and Ambassador Riley cautioned against 
<br>military action. Welch said that while nine UNSC members 
<br>still do not back Morocco's position, international support 
<br>was growing. Mansouri then explained that UN Special Envoy 
<br>Peter Van Walsum had expressed some disappointment with U.S. 
<br>and international support. Welch said we would look at ways 
<br>to publicly support Van Walsum's efforts to achieve a 
<br>solution. He added that the POLISARIO would never have an 
<br>independent state. 
<br>
<br>MAURITANIA 
<br>---------- 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Last but not least, Mansouri expressed deep concern 
<br>about the deteriorating security situation in Mauritania and 
<br>requested that the USG consider enhanced assistance to 
<br>support the new democratic government. Welch said that the 
<br>U.S. is providing more assistance both through the Middle 
<br>East Partnership Initiative and the Trans-Saharan 
<br>Counterterrorism Partnership.

<br>RABAT 00000194 003 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Director General Mansouri, who is very close to King 
<br>Mohammed VI, clearly enjoyed his three hours with Ambassador 
<br>Welch and party. The exchange was frank and collegial as one 
<br>might expect with an ally who shares similar interests and 
<br>perspectives on many regional and international issues. END 
<br>COMMENT.
