<br>SUBJECT: SPAIN/COUSO CASE: JUDGE REJECTS CHIEF PROSECUTOR'S
<br>APPEAL; CASE MOVES ON TO APPEALS TRIBUNAL
<br>
<br>REF: A. MADRID 910
<br>¶B. MADRID 899
<br>¶C. MADRID 800 AND OTHERS
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) On May 24 Spanish investigative magistrate Judge
<br>Santiago Pedraz rejected the appeal of National Court Chief
<br>Prosecutor Javier Zaragoza to drop the charges against three
<br>U.S. servicemen accused of killing Spanish television
<br>cameraman Jose Couso during a firefight in Baghdad in April
<br>¶2003. Despite the rejection by Judge Pedraz, this case will
<br>proceed to the National Court appeals tribunal, which will
<br>rule on the merits of the arguments put forth by Pedraz and
<br>by the National Court prosecutors. As we reported in REFTEL
<br>A, Zaragoza contacted us on May 14 to report that he had
<br>appealed the Pedraz decision to file formal charges against
<br>the three servicemen, saying that his technical and legal
<br>review of the facts led him to conclude that the killing of
<br>Couso was not intentional, and therefore the soldiers could
<br>not be charged with war crimes or murder. In today's ruling
<br>Judge Pedraz claimed to be surprised by Zaragoza's appeal, as
<br>the National Prosecutors Office did not oppose his initial
<br>ruling to reactivate arrest warrants for the servicemen and
<br>therefore tacitly agreed with the case.
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) Comment. Today's ruling by Pedraz was not a
<br>surprise as judges do not normally change their original
<br>ruling after an appeal based on the technical or legal review
<br>of the National Court Prosecutors Office. This case, as we
<br>expected, will now be forwarded to the Criminal Division of
<br>the National Court. Post will continue to report on this
<br>case as it develops.
