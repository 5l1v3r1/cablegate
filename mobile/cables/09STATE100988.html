<br>a date for a second round of talks in Washington in the first 
<br>half of October. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br>BILATERAL DIALOGUE: SLOW AND DIFFICULT 
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Under Secretary Otero opened the meeting by 
<br>reaffirming Secretary Clinton,s commitment to improve 
<br>relations with Bolivia and noting her own interest in finding 
<br>ways to be helpful to the bilateral dialogue process, given 
<br>her Bolivian background. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Foreign Minister Choquehuanca stressed the importance 
<br>of building mutual trust and said Bolivia would always be 
<br>open to dialogue. He appreciated our first round of talks 
<br>(held in May, in La Paz) as a first step in overcoming 
<br>differences and establishing a relationship of mutual 
<br>respect. He did complain there had been no progress since 
<br>then, and that the decisions to remove Bolivia from the 
<br>Andean Trade Preference program (ATPA) and to flunk Bolivia 
<br>in the narcotics certification were not constructive. He 
<br>noted Bolivia,s new alliances with Brazil, Argentina, and 
<br>Paraguay to combat drug trafficking and affirmed that, 
<br>despite difficulties, they are ready for a second round of 
<br>talks. Choquehuanca said the Bolivian government cancelled 
<br>USAID democracy programs &en el marco del dialogo8 and that 
<br>they look forward to discussing pending assistance issues and 
<br>finalizing a bilateral framework agreement. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) U/S Otero welcomed their commitment to advancing the 
<br>dialogue as &good news8 but expressed disappointment in 
<br>Bolivia,s decision to terminate USAID democracy programs. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Charge Solon said they feared a new &golpe8 to the 
<br>dialogue process in December when ATPA legislation is 
<br>renewed. He warned the consequences for the bilateral 
<br>relashionship would be grave if Bolivia is not included. 
<br>Solon said the clock is ticking, and if we do not move fast 
<br>the dialogue will become increasingly difficult and the U.S. 
<br>Congress will eventually put Bolivia in a category where it 
<br>doesn,t belong. He said what they need from us is a 
<br>concrete proposal on what steps we will take to advance the 
<br>dialogue process. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Solon recalled the advances of the first round of 
<br>talks, especially how close we were in reaching agreement on 
<br>principles to guide our development cooperation. Yet, from 
<br>the four elements of their framework agreement proposal 
<br>(political relations, development cooperation, 
<br>counternarcotics, and trade) our counter-proposal was weakest 
<br>in the area of development cooperation, a step backward. 
<br>
<br>-------------- 
<br>MOVING FORWARD 
<br>-------------- 
<br>
<br>
<br>STATE 00100988 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) A/S Shannon noted that although we understand there 
<br>may be another &golpe8 to the dialogue process in December, 
<br>we are working with Congress to look at trade preferences 
<br>more broadly. Noting that we face obstacles on both sides, 
<br>A/S Shannon pointed out that our Congress sees the Bolivian 
<br>government,s decision to expel parts of our mission and to 
<br>terminate USAID democracy programs as punitive actions, and 
<br>justifying engagement becomes an obstacle for us. To that 
<br>end, it would be useful for us to know if we should expect 
<br>further measures before December. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Choquehuanca said what we need is to set a date and 
<br>focus on it. Choquehuanca said the first half of October is 
<br>preferable because Bolivia is hosting the ALBA summit October 
<br>16-17. A/S Shannon said we would present them with a set of 
<br>potential dates by next week. 
<br>
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>WTO Health Services Commitments 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Finally, Charge Solon raised the WTO health services 
<br>commitments issue pending in Geneva. He said no one opposes 
<br>Bolivia,s withdrawal from the commitments except the United 
<br>States. He asked for our assistance in resolving this issue 
<br>in a satisfactory manner and avoiding arbitration.
