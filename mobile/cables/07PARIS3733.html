<br> 
<br>REF: PARIS 3668 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Classified by Polmincouns Josiah Rosenblatt for reasons 
<br>1.4.(b), (d) 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (C)  Following up on reftel, Polmincouns and poloff asked 
<br>French presidential adviser for NEA issues Boris Boillon 
<br>September 6 about the visit to Tehran by French Presidency 
<br>official Richier and MFA DAS Gellet.  Polmincouns noted the 
<br>stark phrasing in President Sarkozy's speech to French 
<br>ambassadors (indicating the world faced the choice between 
<br>Iran with a bomb or bombing Iran) and wondered what it meant 
<br>in the context of the visit.  Boillon was glad we raised the 
<br>subject and stated that Sarkozy had wanted to warn Iran in a 
<br>dramatic and public way that it must cooperate with the 
<br>international community with respect to its nuclear program 
<br>or face potential catastrophe in the form of military action. 
<br> This did not mean, as some media were misinterpreting the 
<br>statement, that France would be ready to participate in such 
<br>action.  Far from it, Boillon continued; France vigorously 
<br>opposed a resort to force and preferred to resolve the 
<br>ongoing dispute diplomatically. 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (C)  Boillon echoed much of what MFA DAS Gellet had 
<br>related in reftel when he observed that the Iranians do not 
<br>seem to understand the gravity of the situation or France's 
<br>position.  They suffer, he complained, from a closed mindset 
<br>that he later termed "autistic."  Boillon recounted in the 
<br>same terms as Gellet the origin of the Iranian initiative 
<br>from Ali Akbar Velayati, foreign affairs adviser to supreme 
<br>leader Khamenei, to establish a special dialogue between 
<br>Tehran and Paris.  Even before Richier and Gellet traveled, 
<br>the GOF told the Iranians to "forget it" if their intention 
<br>was to split France away from the P-5 plus one.  Richier and 
<br>Gellet repeated this message in Tehran and indicated that 
<br>France might be willing to speak of other subjects (NFI). 
<br>Boillon believed the level was perfect in that the French 
<br>sent senior working level officials well below the "political 
<br>level," whereas Velayati clearly was at the political level. 
<br>This disparity gave the French considerable leeway in terms 
<br>of the frankness with which they could speak. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C)  Boillon repeated that it was clear the Iranians did 
<br>not understand or accept the blunt message they heard.  In 
<br>his characteristic candor, Richier told Velayati and other 
<br>Iranian officials that, absent full compliance, sanctions 
<br>against Iran will only ratchet up.  As he previewed the tough 
<br>line that Sarkozy would express in his speech, Richier added 
<br>that France wants to avoid military action against Iran but 
<br>might eventually have to accept it as the only recourse left 
<br>to the international community to prevent a nuclear-armed 
<br>Iran. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (C)  Boillon stated that the GOF had not decided whether 
<br>to continue the dialogue that Richier and Gellet had started. 
<br> Diplomatic contacts, nevertheless, continue apace, and he 
<br>pointed to a then current visit to Paris by Iranian Deputy 
<br>Foreign Minister for European and American Affairs Jalili. 
<br>(Note:  As reported by a staffer of KM Kouchner September 7, 
<br>Jalili had inexplicably not been briefed on Richier's and 
<br>Gellet's message to Velayati.  End note)  Boillon contended 
<br>that France had no problem pursuing a diplomatic dialogue per 
<br>se and kept its embassy in Tehran for just such a reason.  As 
<br>Richier told the Iranians, however, there was no need for a 
<br>special channel if the Iranian aim was to pry France away 
<br>from the P-5 plus one.  Richier was very direct that France 
<br>had no intention to deviate from the line it was on with its 
<br>partners.  Boillon expanded his assessment of the Iranians as 
<br>"autistic like the Syrians.  As with the Syrians, one must be 
<br>direct and not always 'diplomatic.'"
