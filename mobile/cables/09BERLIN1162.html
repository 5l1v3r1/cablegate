<br> 
<br>SUMMARY 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (C//NF) Free Democratic Party (FDP) Chairman Guido 
<br>Westerwelle may be on the verge of becoming Foreign Minister 
<br>and Vice-Chancellor in a Christian Democratic Union 
<br>(CDU)/Christian Social Union (CSU)-FDP government after the 
<br>parliamentary elections on September 27.  He has a strong 
<br>craving for political power and recognition after spending 
<br>eleven years in opposition.  Westerwelle previewed his 
<br>foreign and security policy objectives and views in a major 
<br>speech at the German Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP) on 
<br>May 4, a speech for which the media nicknamed him "Guido 
<br>Genscher," playing on Westerwelle's ideological leanings and 
<br>close relationship with former FDP Foreign Minister 
<br>Hans-Dietrich Genscher. 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (C//NF) Westerwelle's DGAP remarks provided us with a 
<br>glimpse of Westerwellian thought.  They were short on 
<br>substance, suggesting that Westerwelle's command of complex 
<br>foreign and security policy issues still requires deepening 
<br>if he is to successfully represent German interests on the 
<br>world stage (see REFTEL).  While he is a Transatlanticist, 
<br>Westerwelle questions the breadth of U.S. power and U.S. 
<br>calls for stronger German engagement.  He also harbors 
<br>resentment that he has not been taken more seriously by the 
<br>Washington political establishment.  (NOTE: Embassy will 
<br>report SEPTEL on more detailed foreign policy implications 
<br>for the U.S. of a Westerwelle-led MFA).  END SUMMARY. 
<br> 
<br>WESTERWELLE'S FOREIGN POLICY PRIORITIES 
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C) Westerwelle's most important foreign policy 
<br>priorities will be focused on global disarmament and arms 
<br>control.  In remarks in Schwerin on September 17, Westerwelle 
<br>called again for the removal of all U.S. tactical nuclear 
<br>weapons -- within the context of negotiations with NATO -- 
<br>from German soil.  He was very critical of the Bush 
<br>Administration's Missile Defense plans but was quick to 
<br>praise President Obama's recent announcement on Missile 
<br>Defense, saying "this move created additional international 
<br>confidence."  Westerwelle remains a committed 
<br>Transatlanticist but he has been consistently cautious of 
<br>committing German troops to out-of-area deployments. 
<br>Afghanistan was the exception.  Westerwelle continues to 
<br>support Germany's ISAF mandate, but he has also indicated 
<br>that the FDP wants to bring German troops home from 
<br>Afghanistan as soon as possible provided the mission has been 
<br>successfully completed.  Westerwelle and the FDP support 
<br>close engagement with Russia and see it as a "strategic 
<br>partner.  Westerwelle has pursued close ties with Russia's 
<br>leadership during his eleven years in opposition.  On Iran, 
<br>Westerwelle has talked about the need for dialogue but his 
<br>party's pro-business orientation makes him particularly 
<br>skeptical of sanctions and resistant to unilateral efforts to 
<br>cut back trade. 
<br> 
<br>THE UNLIKELY FOREIGN MINISTER 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (C//NF) By his own admission, Westerwelle has never 
<br>seriously harbored a fascination for international affairs. 
<br>FDP Bundestag member Marina Schuster told PolOff recently 
<br>that foreign policy is not Westerwelle's "true love," but 
<br>that he will take this position due to its high profile and 
<br>as it is tied to the position of Vice-Chancellor.  FDP 
<br>contacts tell us that he plans to remain a foreign policy 
<br>generalist, which suggests he will have plenty of time to wax 
<br>lyrical on domestic politics - to the potential detriment of 
<br>political harmony in a possible future CDU/CSU-FDP coalition. 
<br> He also finds very appealing the prospect of being one of 
<br>the only cabinet members besides the chancellor who can 
<br>choose his media advisors, which suggests that Westerwelle 
<br>will continue to place great emphasis on cultivating his 
<br>public image. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (C//NF) There is a contrast between Westerwelle's 
<br>increased public support and successful leadership of the FDP 
<br>versus the continued skepticism, often bordering on contempt, 
<br>shown by much of the German foreign policy elite toward him. 
<br>Opinion polls show that Westerwelle's public image has 
<br>improved substantially in the last year in particular. But, 
<br>as one well known foreign policy analyst in Berlin told 
<br>PolOff, he lacks the gravitas and is seen as too 
<br> 
<br>BERLIN 00001162  002 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>opportunistic to be trusted as foreign minister.  At the 
<br>conclusion of his DGAP speech, several MFA desk officers 
<br>remarked to PolOff that they were not yet persuaded that 
<br>Westerwelle had the "foreign and security policy expertise 
<br>necessary" to become a successful Foreign Minister, although 
<br>they had no doubts about his ability to get up to speed 
<br>quickly.  There was a consensus among desk officers -- 
<br>driven, perhaps, by political bias -- that Westerwelle was 
<br>arrogant and too fixated on maintaining his "cult of 
<br>personality."  Negative reaction to his DGAP speech reflects 
<br>the foreign policy community's skepticism of Westerwelle. 
<br> 
<br>HE'S NO GENSCHER 
<br>---------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (C//NF) Like Dan Quayle in 1992, Westerwelle wants to 
<br>compare himself to his mentor, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, but in 
<br>the eyes of the foreign policy community, he is no Genscher. 
<br>Nevertheless, Westerwelle's world-views have to a large 
<br>extent been shaped by "Genscherism."  British academic 
<br>Timothy Garton Ash described "Genscherism" as an attempt "to 
<br>maintain and improve Germany's ties with a wide range of 
<br>states, which were themselves pursuing quite different and 
<br>quite contrary objectives.  This complex balancing act 
<br>involved saying somewhat different things in different 
<br>places."  Genscherism also embraced a foreign policy "culture 
<br>of restraint," while emphasizing the models of "cooperation" 
<br>and "continuity" in German foreign policy, which Westerwelle 
<br>discussed in his May 4 speech at the DGAP.  Genscher's 
<br>"culture of restraint" had a profound influence on 
<br>Westerwelle's thinking, thus making him very skeptical about 
<br>committing Germany's armed forces to overseas military 
<br>operations  (NOTE: Afghanistan was an exception, although 
<br>with the caveat that Germany's area of responsibility there 
<br>would remain limited to the north and would concentrate on 
<br>police training and civil reconstruction efforts (SEPTEL). 
<br>END NOTE). 
<br> 
<br>A TRANSATLANTICIST WITH A TWIST 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (C//NF) At the June 30 meeting, Westerwelle quickly 
<br>confirmed his Transatlanticist credentials.  Westerwelle's 
<br>views on the United States' role in the world, however, also 
<br>defines his brand of Transatlanticism.  According to 
<br>Westerwelle's political biographer Majid Sattar, Westerwelle 
<br>has never been able to shake his skepticism about how the 
<br>United States wields power in the world.  Citing an exchange 
<br>with former U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Burt 
<br>(1985-1989), Sattar recalls how Westerwelle forcefully 
<br>intervened in a discussion the Ambassador was having on U.S. 
<br>foreign policy during the Cold War to say: "But you are not 
<br>the police of the world."  Sattar comments further that 
<br>Westerwelle was immune to any "transatlantic brainwashing." 
<br>Although Westerwelle used his DGAP speech to criticize the 
<br>United States under the Bush Administration for its excessive 
<br>focus on the War on Terror and unilateralism, saying that the 
<br>United States had lost its compass more than once, 
<br>Westerwelle quickly changed his tune when he talked about the 
<br>positive impact that President Obama has had on U.S. foreign 
<br>policy since his election. 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (C//NF) Westerwelle also made clear that he believes 
<br>Germany needs to be more engaged in U.S. policy-making.  He 
<br>criticized Chancellor Merkel for not having been more engaged 
<br>with Washington on issues of mutual interest, especially arms 
<br>control, when Washington has been engaged in extensive policy 
<br>reviews.  He suggested that the FDP would quickly fill the 
<br>vacuum should they enter government. 
<br> 
<br>WESTERWELLE TO WASHINGTON: WHAT ABOUT ME? 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (C//NF) Westerwelle has found it hard to conceal his 
<br>resentment toward Washington based on his feeling that 
<br>neither its top leadership nor the Embassy in Berlin had 
<br>courted him during his time in opposition.  At a June 30 
<br>meeting between the former CDA and Westerwelle, he criticized 
<br>the Bush Administration for its failure to seek a political 
<br>dialogue with him.  Also revealing was Westerwelle's slight 
<br>edge on his sense of humor, first charming us by inquiring 
<br>about Secretary Clinton's health after her elbow injury and 
<br>next joking that he would ask the Secretary if the Embassy 
<br>had conveyed his best wishes. 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (C//NF) Partially due to his insistence on only 
<br>high-level meetings in Washington (and therefore limited 
<br>contact), Westerwelle remains a relatively unknown political 
<br>figure in the U.S., although he has traveled there many 
<br>times.  Unlike his future potential cabinet colleague, 
<br> 
<br>BERLIN 00001162  003 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Christian Social Union (CSU) Economics Minister Karl-Theodor 
<br>zu Guttenberg, Westerwelle has little professional experience 
<br>in the United States since he never made extensive efforts to 
<br>introduce himself to the Washington policy community. 
<br>Unfortunately, our attempts to reach out to Westerwelle were 
<br>often rebuffed with the excuse that he would only meet the 
<br>Ambassador.  Only after extensive Embassy negotiations with 
<br>Westerwelle's staff were former CDA and PolOff able to secure 
<br>the June 30 meeting. 
<br> 
<br>COMMENT 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶11.  (C//NF) One week before the parliamentary elections, 
<br>polls indicate that Westerwelle stands a good chance of 
<br>becoming Germany's next foreign minister, a position he has 
<br>been preparing for since 2002.  If Westerwelle becomes 
<br>Foreign Minister, we can expect tough love diplomacy from 
<br>someone who prides himself in being our "close" friend, but 
<br>who in reality remains skeptical about the U.S. and its 
<br>foreign policy objectives.  Westerwelle will be a friend, but 
<br>he will not hesitate to criticize us if vital German 
<br>interests are at stake or being challenged.  Westerwelle's 
<br>prickliness toward the United States would likely be 
<br>neutralized by the long-sought attention from Washington he 
<br>would receive if he becomes foreign minister.  Germany's 
<br>foreign policy elite will continue to view him with 
<br>skepticism.  The factor that assuages some of this concern, 
<br>however, is that no one expects him to be able to match 
<br>Chancellor Merkel if he does become Foreign Minister, and 
<br>policy experts tell us that foreign policy influence is 
<br>likely to shift even further to the Chancellery.  END COMMENT. 
<br> 
<br>BIO NOTES 
<br>--------- 
<br> 
<br>¶12.  (U) Dr. Guido Westerwelle was born on December 27, 1961 
<br>in Bad Honnef (near Bonn) to Dr. Heinrich and Erika 
<br>Westerwelle.  Family members note that Westerwelle inherited 
<br>the unbridled, aggressive temperament of his father and the 
<br>calculated, deliberate, and hesitant cleverness of his 
<br>mother.  His parents divorced when he was 8 years old, which 
<br>according to Westerwelle himself, left a scar on his 
<br>educational and physical development.  After the divorce, 
<br>Westerwelle was raised by his father -- a lawyer -- and he 
<br>maintained a close relationship with his mother, also a 
<br>career lawyer, who lived nearby.  Stefan and Henrik, Guido's 
<br>half brothers, one from each of his parents' previous 
<br>relationships, were older and soon left the house to live on 
<br>their own.  Westerwelle grew up with his younger brother Kai; 
<br>they were very similar and both were considered active 
<br>extroverts who enjoyed debates.  Westerwelle enjoys horses 
<br>and to this day he is an avid equestrian. 
<br> 
<br>¶13.  (SBU) Westerwelle is openly gay.  He has said that this 
<br>was not a problem at home since he was raised to be 
<br>self-confident and his family was very liberal.  In addition, 
<br>Bonn, where Westerwelle went to university was a liberal 
<br>town.  Westerwelle officially came out rather quietly in the 
<br>political world in 2005 at Merkel's 50th birthday party when 
<br>he brought his partner, Michael Mronz, a sports manager, to 
<br>the party.  Mronz is currently a steering board member of the 
<br>2009 Berlin World Track and Field World Championships. 
<br>Ironically, Westerwelle is conservative on gay rights.  He is 
<br>keen to protect the special status of marriages and families 
<br>under German law.  He opposes adoption by same sex couples 
<br>but says that he wishes he could have children. 
<br> 
<br>¶14.  (U) Westerwelle developed an early taste for politics, 
<br>being the editor of his high school newspaper.  He caused a 
<br>school controversy when he named teachers who he felt did not 
<br>respect students who had transferred into the secondary high 
<br>school system from the grammar school system.  As a result of 
<br>his story, many teachers developed a dislike for Westerwelle. 
<br> He further developed his political thinking when he attended 
<br>an event with Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Otto Graf Lambsdorff 
<br>during the 1980 parliamentary elections.  It was at that time 
<br>that he decided to join the FDP and form an FDP youth group 
<br>in Bonn.  Westerwelle eventually became a lawyer but his 
<br>younger brother Kai once said he had the impression that 
<br>being a lawyer was never his brother's real goal.  His 
<br>understanding of the media and their use for his own 
<br>political purposes is envied by many politicians.  He takes a 
<br>pro-active approach to overseeing his party's media 
<br>operations.  In front of the camera, Westerwelle comes across 
<br>as serious, sharp, and calculating, and almost comical at 
<br>times with what is perceived as a very exaggerated presence. 
<br>In person, people say Westerwelle is very gallant, funny, and 
<br>sarcastic. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>BERLIN 00001162  004 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶15.  (U)  In his free time, Westerwelle enjoys attending 
<br>concerts and reading.  He enjoys running, beach volleyball, 
<br>sailing, horseback riding, and mountain biking.  He collects 
<br>paintings from New Leipzig School artists such as Neo Rauch 
<br>and Tim Eitel and is a fond collector of works by Norbert 
<br>Bisky and Joerg Immendorff.  He enjoys vacationing in Italy 
<br>and Spain.
