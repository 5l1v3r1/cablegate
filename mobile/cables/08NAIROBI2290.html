<br>------- 
<br>Summary 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S-NF) A shipment of 33 Ukrainian T-72 tanks and other 
<br>ammunition and equipment aboard the M/V Faina, currently 
<br>under the control of pirates off the coast of Somalia, has 
<br>raised questions and controversy in Kenya about their final 
<br>destination. It is a poorly kept secret that the tanks are 
<br>bound for the Government of South Sudan -- and that the 
<br>Government of Kenya has been facilitating shipments from 
<br>Ukraine to the Government of South Sudan since 2007. Since 
<br>the world's eyes are now on the M/V Faina, it is unlikely 
<br>that the tanks, if released, would go immediately to their 
<br>intended destination. Instead, they are likely to sit in a 
<br>Kenyan military depot until the world's attention shifts 
<br>elsewhere. In the meantime, the Kenyan military is in an 
<br>uncomfortable spot. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>--------------------- 
<br>Kenya Claims T-72s... 
<br>--------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) The hijacking of the Ukrainian-owned, Belize-flagged 
<br>merchant vessel (M/V) Faina -- and subsequent confimation by 
<br>the government of Ukraine that there are 33 T-72 tanks and 
<br>other ammunition and equipment onboard -- has raised 
<br>questions about the cargo's ultimate destination. In a move 
<br>likely aimed at stemming controversy, the Government of Kenya 
<br>has claimed that the ultimate destination for the shipment is 
<br>the Kenyan Armed Forces. It is a poorly-kept secret, 
<br>however, that the shipment was originally bound for South 
<br>Sudan. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S-NF) The contradictions have already been highlighted in 
<br>the press. Kenyan Government spokesman Alfred Mutua and 
<br>Kenyan Defense spokesman Bogita Ongeri have both insisted 
<br>that the tanks belong to Kenya. East Africa Seafarers' 
<br>Assistance Program spokesman Andrew Mwangura told a different 
<br>story: that the shipment ultimately was bound for the 
<br>Government of South Sudan. (Note: Intelligence reporting 
<br>(refs A-C) confirms Mwangura's story -- not the official GOK 
<br>stance. After reporting that he was warned by Kenyan 
<br>government officials to stop talking about the shipment, 
<br>Mwangura was arrested on October 1. End Note.) 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) MFA Director of Political Affairs Ambassador Ben Ogutu 
<br>maintained the party line to PolOff on September 30, but 
<br>expressed relief that the Ministry of Defense has the lead on 
<br>the issue. "e are just repeating the information that the 
<br>Ministry has provided to us," Ogutu said. (Note: Ogutu also 
<br>expressed great interest in what U.S. officials in Washington 
<br>would say about the arms' ultimate destination. End Note.) 
<br>
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>...Although They Were Juba-Bound 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S-NF) Since last year, Kenya's Ministry of Defense has 
<br>indeed played a major role in assisting the Government of 
<br>South Sudan receive arms shipments from the Government of 
<br>Ukraine. When the shipments are off-loaded at the port of 
<br>Mombasa, they are transported via rail to Uganda and then 
<br>onward to Southern Sudan (ref C). Military officials have 
<br>expressed discomfort with this arrangement, however, and have 
<br>made it clear to us that the orders come "from the top." 
<br>(i.e., President Kibaki) 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S-NF) Given the extensive local and international media 
<br>attention, it is unlikely that the shipment will go directly 
<br>to Sudan should the cargo be offloaded in Mombasa as 
<br>originally planned. A high-level military official has 
<br>indicated to us that if received, the cargo will be offloaded 
<br>and delivered to a military depot in Kenya, where it will 
<br>likely sit for a few months before risking the overland 
<br>shipment to Sudan. 
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>Not the First Time 
<br>------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S-NF) This is not the first time a T-72 shipment to South 
<br>Sudan has been publicly diverted. In mid-February, the 
<br>Government of Kenya was reported as "seizing" a shipment of 
<br>tanks bound for the Sudan People's Liberation Army as it 
<br>violated the 2003 Comprehensive Peace Agreement to end 
<br>Sudan's civil war. The "seizure" occurred when Kenya's own 
<br>security situation was still precarious given the 
<br>post-election crisis. The tanks were ultimately released and 
<br>proceeded to Sudan, and the cargo currently aboard the M/V 
<br>Faina was meant to complete the tank sale. (Note: Although 
<br>there is no arms embargo against Southern Sudan, the CPA does 
<br>say that the parties "agree in principle to proportional 
<br>downsizing of the forces on both sides" following the cease 
<br>fire. The CPA permits the resupply of lethal military items 
<br>on approval by the Joint Defense Board and UN mission. End 
<br>Note.) 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Comment: While Kenya does see itself as a guarantor of 
<br>the 2003 Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which was signed in 
<br>Nairobi, the highest levels of government have nevertheless 
<br>allowed previous arms shipments to proceed. Kenya's 
<br>political leadership has thereby put the Kenyan military in a 
<br>in an uncomfortable spot. Some Kenyan military officials 
<br>have been questioning whether Kenya should be facilitating 
<br>arms deliveries since well before the M/V Faina made 
<br>headlines. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Comment, cont: While no one is talking about why Kenya 
<br>is in this position, we can think of a few reasons. First, 
<br>it is possible that Kenya's political leadership wants to 
<br>support the Government of South Sudan but not in a way that 
<br>will openly provoke Khartoum or potentially threaten South 
<br>Sudan's eventual independence. Vice President Musyoka's 
<br>public opposition to the International Criminal Court's 
<br>indictment of President Bashir (because it could threaten the 
<br>CPA) illustrates this point. Second, the government appears 
<br>genuinely sensitive to charges that major arms shipments 
<br>would be in violation of the spirit of the CPA. Third, given 
<br>Kenya's track record on corruption, it is always possible 
<br>that there is a financial benefit for a senior Kenyan 
<br>official (or two, or more) in return for facilitating the 
<br>arms shipments. As such, the question of "Who owns the 
<br>tanks?" will remain a touchy side issue for Kenya in the 
<br>piracy of the M/V Faina.
