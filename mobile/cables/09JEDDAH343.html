<br>SUMMARY 
<br>-------- 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (S/NF) During CDA Richard Erdman's September 5 meeting 
<br>with Saudi Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
<br>Interior Prince Nayif bin Abdulaziz (reftel), John Brennan, 
<br>Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and 
<br>Counterterrorism, stressed USG condemnation of the August 28 
<br>terrorist attack on Assistant Interior Minister Prince 
<br>Mohammed bin Nayif (MbN) and strong USG support for Saudi 
<br>Arabia in combating violent extremism.  Nayif emphasized that 
<br>the attack had in no way diminished the SAG's resolve to 
<br>eliminate terrorism -- despite the danger -- and described 
<br>SAG's multifaceted approach, which combines refuting 
<br>terrorist ideology, security operations, and rehabilitation. 
<br>The Prince also complained that Iran had breached its 2001 
<br>security agreement with KSA and was supporting aggression 
<br>against the kingdom; expressed frustration with European 
<br>nations for allowing terrorists to operate against KSA rather 
<br>than handing them over, and requested US intercession to 
<br>change this European policy.  Both parties reaffirmed their 
<br>commitment to the US-Saudi relationship begun by FDR and King 
<br>Abdulaziz, especially the partnership between security 
<br>channels.  End summary. 
<br> 
<br>USG SUPPORT FOR SAUDI ARABIA 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S/NF) At a previously scheduled September 5 farewell call 
<br>on Prince Nayif, Charge introduced Mr. Brennan and asked him 
<br>to brief on Washington perspectives on current 
<br>counterterrorism challenges and efforts.  Brennan opened by 
<br>conveying U.S. condemnation and concern over the August 27 
<br>attack on Assistant Interior Minister Mohammed bin Nayif as 
<br>well as our great relief that he had survived the cowardly 
<br>attack.  In this regard, he said he had brought a personal 
<br>letter from President Obama to Prince Mohammed expressing our 
<br>concern and best wishes.  The U.S., he continued, greatly 
<br>admired and appreciated the courageous work being done by the 
<br>Ministry of Interior and the Mabahith against violent 
<br>extremism and terrorism. 
<br> 
<br>SHARED CONCERNS ABOUT YEMEN 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S/NF) President Obama felt personally outraged by the 
<br>attack, Brennan said, and emphasized that it was critically 
<br>important that the U.S. and Saudi Arabia went forward in the 
<br>fight against violent extremism.  Noting that he would be 
<br>visiting Yemen the following day, Brennan said he would 
<br>stress to President Saleh, in the strongest possible terms, 
<br>the importance of combating terrorism and resolving the 
<br>serious problems facing his country.  Brennan also confirmed 
<br>to Prince Nayif that the USG was working very closely with 
<br>the Mabahith and would be discussing in the coming days how 
<br>to approach the threat coming from Yemen. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>NAYIF: NO WEAKENING OF SAUDI RESOLVE AGAINST TERRORISM 
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------- 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (S/NF) Thanking Brennan for USG support, Nayif emphasized 
<br>that the attack had not weakened SAG's resolve to eliminate 
<br>terrorism.  Following the incident, he said, the King met 
<br>with MbN, who stressed that acts of terror "would not keep us 
<br>from working and doing our job."  At the same time, the door 
<br>must always remain open to those militants who wanted to 
<br>return to society.  These terrorists were attacking the 
<br>country as a whole and would not hesitate to attack anyone to 
<br>reach their goals. "Every Saudi official is at risk of 
<br>attack," he said.  "Despite this, we are still willing to put 
<br>forth more effort against terrorism, which is more dangerous 
<br>than any illness."  Fear of losing one's life was not a 
<br>reason to stop working. We had a duty to defend the country, 
<br>and it was preferable to die doing one's duty.  "God 
<br>determined a person's fate and everyone will go back to God." 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (S/NF) Nayif then described SAG's approach to terrorism as 
<br>including countering terrorist ideology, armed 
<br>counterterrorism operations, and a rehabilitation program for 
<br>militants who surrendered. The SAG has created a strategic 
<br>communications center where intellectuals and imams worked to 
<br>explain to the public that terrorists were working against 
<br>the true ways of Islam and attacking Saudi society.  In 
<br>countering the spread of jihadist ideology, Nayif added, the 
<br>Friday mosque sermons -- delivered four times a month in the 
<br>country's more than 15,000 mosques -- were one of the most 
<br>effective vehicles. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (S/NF) Asked about the economic impact of the recent 
<br>attack, Nayif asserted that Saudi Arabia was better off than 
<br>any country in the region and among the best-situated 
<br>globally in terms of economic activity.  Using a favorite 
<br>line, he said:  "We know that capital is a coward and wants a 
<br>safe place."  For this reason, people could invest with 
<br>confidence in the Kingdom, the economy was growing, and the 
<br>government was continuing its development plans.  The economy 
<br>was thriving and the security situation was good despite 
<br>being among the countries most subject to terrorist attacks. 
<br>Saudi Arabia had thwarted more than 200 terrorist operations, 
<br>he said, and only 5 percent of planned attacks had actually 
<br>occurred.  "We've achieved many things in protecting the 
<br>country and, God willing, we will achieve many more things 
<br>with our friends."  Brennan praised SAG efforts to combat 
<br>terrorism: "I wish other countries in the world were as 
<br>willing and capable." Saudi Arabia, he stated, was on the 
<br>front line of terrorism, a model in preventing individuals 
<br>from being corrupted by the propaganda of Al Qaeda, and thus 
<br>instrumental in demonstrating to the West and the U.S. that 
<br>Al Qaeda was a perversion of Islam and did not represent the 
<br>true faith. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>IRAN PROMOTING TERRORISM 
<br>------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (S/NF) Nayif complained that over the past two years Iran 
<br>has hosted Saudis (all Sunnis) -- including Osama bin Laden's 
<br>son Ibrahim -- who had contacts with terrorists and worked 
<br>against the Kingdom.  SAG considered this aggressive action a 
<br>breach of the 2001 security agreement between the two 
<br>nations.  The SAG has informed Iran through its ambassador 
<br>and the MFA, asking the GOI to hand over these Saudis.  Nayif 
<br>recalled that after the operations in Khobar in 1996, the SAG 
<br>tried to open channels with Iran and tried to improve 
<br>relations during Khatami's presidency.  He himself had met 
<br>personally with Iranian National Security Secretary General 
<br>Dr. Hassan Rohani (Iran's Supreme Council on National 
<br>Security) and had signed a security agreement in which Iran 
<br>promised to show respect and not take any actions inside or 
<br>outside Iran against the Kingdom.  Brennan agreed that Iran 
<br>had the capacity to cause trouble, and assured the Prince 
<br>that the USG was very concerned and looking carefully at the 
<br>situation.  President Obama's willingness to talk to the 
<br>Iranians did not mean he did not understand the problem. 
<br>Brennan emphasized the SAG's strong friends in the White 
<br>House, including President Obama, wanted to work very closely 
<br>with Saudi Arabia on this front. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>FRUSTRATION WITH EUROPE 
<br>----------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (S/NF) Nayif expressed frustration with the limited 
<br>cooperation of friendly European nations with whom the 
<br>Kingdom has security agreements.  The governments, he 
<br>complained, shared information but did not take any action. 
<br>As a result, "terrorists roam around freely in their 
<br>countries," and the Europeans have not handed over 
<br>terrorists.  For example, Ibrahim (Salih Mohammed Al-Yacoub), 
<br>a very important suspect involved in the Khobar bombing, was 
<br>in Europe.  Saudi Arabia asked several nations to hand him 
<br>over as a terrorist who had acted against the Kingdom and the 
<br>United States.  Nayif complained that while these European 
<br>countries were friendly, had good relations, and shared 
<br>interests with the Kingdom, he failed to understand why 
<br>Europeans harbored terrorists working against Saudi Arabia in 
<br>their countries.  If there were people in Saudi Arabia 
<br>working against friendly countries, the SAG would intervene. 
<br>Nayif requested USG help in convincing Europe to work more 
<br>cooperatively.  Brennan commented that we had similar 
<br>frustrations with some countries. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>USG-SAUDI SECURITY TIES STRONGER THAN EVER 
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (S/NF) Throughout the two-hour meeting, Nayif highlighted 
<br>the importance of bilateral security cooperation, noting that 
<br>the level of professional exchange has been excellent.  Nayif 
<br>commented that there has been success in exchanging 
<br>information, procuring the best, newest, most updated 
<br>technology and in finding and preventing terrorist acts 
<br>before they happen.  The final goal, he stressed, was to stop 
<br>terrorists and "dry out their resources."  Asked by Charge if 
<br>he meant terrorist financing, Nayif replied:  "Yes. When we 
<br>say 'resources' we mean people, training, and money.  We have 
<br>found huge sums of money on many terrorists we have caught." 
<br>Nayif expressed the hope that through joint cooperation Al 
<br>Qaeda as the source of terrorism in the Kingdom and 
<br>throughout the world could be destroyed. He added that the 
<br>support from U.S.-Saudi leadership in this area was 
<br>critically important to reach the goal.  Nayif thanked 
<br>President Obama for supporting strengthened security ties 
<br>between the two countries and said that King Abdullah was 
<br>strongly committed to cooperating with the United States 
<br>against terrorism.  Recalling the 1945 visit between FDR and 
<br>King Abdulaziz, Nayif declared, "We're acting upon what they 
<br>decided."  Brennan responded that President Obama would be 
<br>pleased to hear that the Saudi commitment to our special 
<br>relationship remained stronger than ever. 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (U) This message was cleared by Assistant to the 
<br>President John Brennan.
