<br>SUBJECT: DEPUTY PROSECUTOR DESCRIBES TO AMBASSADOR SADDAM'S 
<br>EXECUTION, CONTROVERSIES 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: In a January 6 meeting with the Ambassador, 
<br>Deputy Prosecutor Monqith Al-Faroun described Saddam's 
<br>execution, including the people present, the cell phone video 
<br>and the verbal taunts from guards at the scene. He stated 
<br>that he saw two Iraqi officials using their phones and that 
<br>once the taunting began he admonished the crowd to stay 
<br>silent. The Ambassador questioned the execution's timing - 
<br>one hour before Sunni Eid began - to which al-Faroun replied 
<br>that religious scholars concluded Eid did not start until 
<br>sunrise and therefore the execution could proceed. He 
<br>attributed international condemnation for the execution's 
<br>timing to the fact that many countries are against the death 
<br>penalty. He said that President Talabani did not have the 
<br>authority to change a sentence handed down from the Iraqi 
<br>High Tribunal which is why he was not asked to sign a decree. 
<br>When asked what would be different about the two remaining 
<br>executions, al-Faroun replied that only required witnesses - 
<br>a prosecutor, judge, a religious leader and the prison 
<br>director - would be allowed inside. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
<br>HOW IT HAPPENED: LAST MINUTE PLANS, GATHERING THE WITNESSES 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) The Ambassador began the meeting thanking Al-Faroun 
<br>for his courage, noting that it was not a risk-free endeavor 
<br>"bringing Saddam to justice." He noted that what happened 
<br>during the execution "tainted" the entire episode and asked 
<br>for the prosecutor's perspective. "We need to look back in 
<br>order to look forward," the Ambassador said, referencing the 
<br>two other executions still scheduled to occur in January. 
<br>Al-Faroun described arriving at the Prime Minister's 
<br>Residence on December 29 after he was informed the execution 
<br>would occur early the next morning. Included in the planning 
<br>and discussions were a group of Iraqi advisors from the PM's 
<br>office and other GOI officials, including National Security 
<br>Advisor Muwafuq Rubaie. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Following this meeting, al-Faroun said, the fourteen 
<br>officials went directly to the helicopter landing zone, LZ 
<br>Washington located in the International Zone adjacent to the 
<br>Embassy Annex, for travel aboard a MNF-I helicopter to the 
<br>execution site. At LZ Washington American personnel searched 
<br>everyone and took the passengers' cell phones, al-Faroun 
<br>explained. It was a very "thorough" search, he said. (Note: 
<br>The Iraqi officials were searched by U.S. Marshals, who took 
<br>the cell phones for operational security reasons and returned 
<br>the cell phones once the 14 passengers landed in LZ 
<br>Washington following the execution. They also checked to 
<br>ensure that no weapons were carried on the aircraft. End 
<br>Note). The fourteen officials then boarded two helicopters 
<br>for the flight to northeastern Baghdad where the execution 
<br>occurred. The Ambassador asked if al-Faroun knew about a van 
<br>that allegedly arrived at the execution site with additional 
<br>people wanting to witness the execution. Al-Faroun did not 
<br>know about the van, but said the only witnesses to the actual 
<br>execution were the fourteen that arrived via helicopter and 
<br>the guards already at the location. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) Comment: During a final, hasty meeting the evening of 
<br>29 December, Dr. Rubaie stated to Ambassador Scobey and MG 
<br>Gardner that the GOI had developed a plan for the remaining 
<br>logistical details and accepted the responsibility for the 
<br>execution. The US would securely transport Saddam to the 
<br>site, transfer custody, and potentially help with the 
<br>transportation of remains. No US personnel would be present 
<br>at the execution or in the adjacent courtyard. The GOI 
<br>witness list changed several times prior to the execution and 
<br>at one point included 20-30 personnel. MNF-I agreed to fly 
<br>14 witnesses from LZ Washington. The GOI ultimately decided 
<br>that other witnesses would travel by car. About one hour 
<br>prior to the execution an SUV arrived at the base. The 
<br>guards manning the base entry point searched the vehicle for 
<br>weapons and explosives and then allowed the vehicle to 
<br>proceed to the execution building. The vehicle included six 
<br>personnel identified by the GOI as their video personnel and 
<br>PSD. We do not know if this group was searched by Iraqi 
<br>guards at the execution site. It is also unknown which of 
<br>the 6 actually entered the execution building as no US 
<br>personnel were in the courtyard or building. After the 
<br>transfer of physical custody of Saddam inside the holding 
<br>cell building, MNF-I personnel moved away from the execution 
<br>site to positions around the small MOJ compound. The GOI was 
<br>responsible for the execution building, access to the 
<br>building and courtyard, and the conduct of the execution. 
<br>The GOI's lack of a clear and coordinated plan to control the 
<br>witnesses and conduct the execution resulted in a hastily run 
<br>and confusing event. End Comment

<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
<br>FINAL PLANS: UNTIL THIS POINT, NOTHING IMPROPER OCCURRED 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Al-Faroun and the judge immediately separated from the 
<br>group to meet with Saddam, read the verdict and escort him to 
<br>the execution room. Al-Faroun said he "sympathized" with 
<br>Saddam who entered with his covered head, hands tied and 
<br>shaking involuntarily. The judge then read the verdict and 
<br>the death sentence. At that point Al-Faroun said, Saddam 
<br>became more animated and began speaking, "as if he were still 
<br>the President." Once the readings had finished, al-Faroun 
<br>explained, the three men, accompanied by four prison guards, 
<br>walked down a long corridor lined with the fourteen witnesses 
<br>to the room where the execution would occur. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S) The Ambassador asked whether this was the same site 
<br>Saddam used to execute Dawa party members. Al-Faroun 
<br>affirmed that it was the same place, but noted that it had 
<br>also been used for other executions as well. EmbOff 
<br>confirmed the location has been used previously and that 
<br>Americans constructed the execution platform. Al-Faroun 
<br>interjected that the original platform was not built to 
<br>proper standards, and that as a result criminals were 
<br>suffering during execution. The new platform requires 
<br>prisoners to climb a flight of stairs and ensures less 
<br>suffering, al-Faroun said. The Ambassador then asked whether 
<br>the four guards were members of Jaysh al-Mahdi (JAM), the 
<br>militia loyal to Shia extremist Moqtada al-Sadr. Al-Faroun 
<br>replied that as far as he knew they were official prison 
<br>guards. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Rubaie then approached Saddam and asked him if he was 
<br>afraid. Saddam responded that he was not afraid, that he had 
<br>been "anticipating this moment" since he first came to power, 
<br>knowing that as President he had many enemies. Saddam had 
<br>been holding a Koran and asked who among the witnesses would 
<br>ensure Awad al-Bandar's son received it. Al-Faroun agreed to 
<br>take the book and after Saddam handed it to him the guards 
<br>retied his hands. Al-Faroun emphasized that up until this 
<br>point nothing "improper" had occurred. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
<br>...AND THEN THE TAUNTING, THE YELLING, THE PHOTOS BEGIN 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (S) The guards then began to tie Saddam's feet at which 
<br>point he asked who would help him climb the stairs. It was 
<br>at this moment, al-Faroun said, that a guard told Saddam to 
<br>"go to hell." Al-Faroun raised his voice immediately and 
<br>warned people that "he would not allow the guards or 
<br>witnesses to speak" to Saddam. He turned around, he said, to 
<br>further admonish the witnesses and saw two government 
<br>officials openly taking photos with their mobile phones. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (S) Two guards escorted Saddam upstairs and offered to 
<br>cover his head with a hood. Saddam refused. The executioner 
<br>explained that the noose could cut his neck and offered him a 
<br>cloth to prevent any pain. The prison guards, standing below 
<br>the platform watched Saddam as he prayed. Before Saddam 
<br>finished, al-Faroun said, one person shouted "Moqtada, 
<br>Moqtada, Moqtada." The prosecutor claimed that he again 
<br>raised his voice to silence the witnesses. This disruption, 
<br>he said, occurred only once and did not delay the execution. 
<br>Saddam Hussein died instantaneously. He was removed from the 
<br>platform and placed in a bag. A religious leader later 
<br>ensured that Saddam's body had been washed according to 
<br>Islamic custom. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---------------- 
<br>CONTROVERSIES - TIMING AND LEGAL ISSUES - AND LESSONS LEARNED 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---------------- 
<br>
<br>¶10. (S) Al-Faroun told the Ambassador that despite the 
<br>controversies, he witnessed "a condemned person convicted in 
<br>a legal trial" which had proven Saddam "killed thousands." 
<br>The Ambassador agreed that Saddam's supporters would use the 
<br>execution as an excuse to condemn what had been a fair and 
<br>just trial. However, he continued, there were many people 
<br>who had been happy to see Saddam brought to justice who were 
<br>now upset by how the execution occurred. The Ambassador 
<br>asked about the execution's timing, commenting that having 
<br>the execution one hour before Sunni's celebrated Eid has 
<br>angered some people. Al-Faroun replied that there are both 
<br>social and legal opinions about implementing the death 
<br>penalty during holidays. The legal opinion, he said, states 
<br>that criminals cannot be executed on a holiday. The GOI 
<br>examined the timing, he said, and experts concluded that if 
<br>
<br>BAGHDAD 00000146 003 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>it finished before sunrise it would not coincide with Eid. 
<br>The social opinion shared by some members of the 
<br>international community, he continued, is that the death 
<br>penalty should not be used at any time regardless of whether 
<br>it occurs during a holiday. Al-Faroun disregarded this 
<br>argument, noting that law "does not take into account 
<br>people's feelings." 
<br>
<br>¶11. (S) The Ambassador stated that some have questioned the 
<br>execution's legality given the absence of an "administrative 
<br>affirmation" from President Talabani. The Ambassador noted 
<br>that if the PM did not believe an affirmation was necessary, 
<br>they should have asked Iraqi Chief Justice Medhat to declare 
<br>this in writing. The prosecutor responded that under Iraqi 
<br>law the President has the ability to reduce sentences for 
<br>normal crimes. Saddam's sentence was not presented to the 
<br>President because in this instance he had no authority to 
<br>commute the sentence. Article 27 of the Iraqi Criminal 
<br>Courts law, al-Faroun said, states that sentences issued from 
<br>the Iraqi High Tribunal cannot be reduced. The reason for 
<br>this, he explained, is because cases prosecuted here are 
<br>crimes against humanity instead of crimes against Iraq. An 
<br>Iraqi leader, therefore, does not have the authority to 
<br>reduce these sentences. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) The Ambassador asked al-Faroun what the GOI will 
<br>change in the next two upcoming executions. Al-Faroun 
<br>responded emphatically that the only witnesses who will be 
<br>permitted are those required by law: a public prosecutor, a 
<br>judge, a religious leader and the prison director. This, he 
<br>concluded, will prevent unacceptable behavior and unnecessary 
<br>controversy.
