<br>SUBJECT: WHEN WILL ODYSSEY SHIPS SAIL OUT?
<br>
<br>REF: MADRID 1191 AND PREVIOUS
<br>
<br>Classified By: Deputy Cheif of Mission Hugo Llorens for reasons 1.4 (b)
<br>and (d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Odyssey Marine Exploration representatives Marie
<br>Rogers and Ali Nasser requested a meeting with EconOff June
<br>26 to informally update the Embassy on the American company's
<br>plans to sail out from Gibraltar. Despite assurances that the
<br>Spanish would indeed attempt to execute the warrant against
<br>Odyssey, possibly leading to the detention of its vessel/s in
<br>disputed international waters, Nasser said the company had
<br>decided nonetheless to leave port as soon as possible.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) The Odyssey representatives outlined a 3-step timeline
<br>for one or both vessels' departure from port which could
<br>occur as early as next week. The first step would be the
<br>drafting of an "Affidavit of Events" leading up to Odyssey's
<br>"Black Swan" find (reftel). US Odyssey lawyers are currently
<br>drafting that affidavit which will include a declaration that
<br>in Fall 2006, Odyssey head Greg Stemm met with the Ministry
<br>of Culture on what eventually turned out to be the "Black
<br>Swan" find. Once this affidavit is complete, the second step
<br>is for Odyssey representatives to once more approach the
<br>Ministry of Culture, affidavit in hand, to attempt to reach a
<br>compromise. From the date of this meeting, Odyssey employees
<br>will begin the third step of divesting its vessels of the
<br>expensive exploration equipment currently onboard. Once this
<br>divestment is complete, the Odyssey vessels will set sail
<br>with an American master, with representatives Ali Nasser and
<br>Marie Rogers, and with a filming crew on board.
<br>
<br>3.(C) Nasser said that in the interests of transparency,
<br>Odyssey will notify the Spanish Guardia Civil the night
<br>before of their intentions to set sail. If the Spanish do
<br>not detain the ships, then they will sail on to Great
<br>Britain. Nasser also indicated that should the Ministry of
<br>Culture be receptive to compromise, Odyssey representatives
<br>would offer to sail their vessels into Spanish waters to
<br>allow a search while avoiding an international dispute over
<br>the waters around Gibraltar. Nasser said that Odyssey was
<br>also prepared to invite GoS along on its next salvaging trip
<br>to the Black Swan site. However, Nasser caveated, these
<br>offers would only be given if the Spanish guarantee that they
<br>will not detain Odyssey ships. Econoff expressed
<br>appreciation for Odyssey efforts towards compromise, and
<br>encouraged continued flexibility in reaching a solution that
<br>would avert contestation in international waters where all
<br>parties, including Odyssey, would lose.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Comment: Odyssey's current strategy is to provide a
<br>"face saving" way out for Spain that would also allow the
<br>Odyssey to regain the use of their ships. The Ministry of
<br>Culture and its corresponding Andalucian stakeholders will be
<br>the key to how this issue proceeds. Though the offer to allow
<br>a Spanish representative to be on board when the Odyssey
<br>returns to the Black Swan site may be tempting to MoC, it is
<br>difficult to predict how emotions or local political
<br>gamesmanship will affect the outcome. Ultimately, the larger
<br>issue for both parties is ownership of the coins, a theme
<br>where neither Odyssey nor the different Spanish factions have
<br>expressed a willingness to budge. Odyssey's thoughts on how
<br>to approach this dispute are ever changing, and hence there
<br>is always a possibility that their course of action may
<br>change. Nonetheless, Odyssey representatives advised Post
<br>that they would continue to keep us in the loop of
<br>developments.
