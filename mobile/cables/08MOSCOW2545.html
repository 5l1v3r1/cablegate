<br>
<br>Classified By: Minister Counselor for Political Affairs Alice G. Wells; 
<br>reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: In a solid show of support, both the 
<br>Federation Council and the Duma voted unanimously to urge 
<br>that President Medvedev recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia 
<br>as independent states. Parliamentarians blasted Georgia for 
<br>having launched a military campaign against South Ossetia, 
<br>and pointed the finger at the U.S. as having planted the 
<br>seeds for the aggression by arming and training the Georgian 
<br>military. Having ratcheted up expectations of imminent 
<br>Russian action, some observers now believe Medvedev and Putin 
<br>will wait to see if the international community meets 
<br>Russia's demands: UN confirmation of Russia's peacekeeping 
<br>role and condemnation of Saakashvili. Medvedev can be 
<br>expected to proceed cautiously, taking advantage of a 
<br>situation that, at the moment, he perceives to be in Russia's 
<br>favor. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) The Federation Council, meeting August 25, 
<br>unanimously approved an appeal to President Medvedev that he 
<br>immediately recognize the independence of Abkhazia and South 
<br>Ossetia. In a remarkably organized and disciplined one-hour 
<br>session, Council leaders and 45 members quickly delivered 
<br>statements pillorying Georgia for having attacked Tskhinvali 
<br>August 7. Abkhaz and South Ossetian leaders Bagapsh and 
<br>Kokoity also addressed the session, proclaiming the support 
<br>of residents of those territories for independence from 
<br>Georgia. The Abkhaz leader also confirmed his readiness to 
<br>sign a agreement on military cooperation with Russia. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) Following smartly on the heels of that session, the 
<br>Duma convened to consider a similar appeal to Medvedev. In 
<br>that larger body, popularly elected legislators took their 
<br>time to score rhetorical points. The resolution calling for 
<br>recognition was introduced by CIS Committee Chairman 
<br>Ostrovskiy. International relations Committee Chairman 
<br>Kosachev introduced a companion appeal to the UN and to 
<br>parliaments of UN member states urging them also to recognize 
<br>the two entities. Once again, Bagapsh and Kokoity led off 
<br>discussion of the appeal, charging that steps by "western 
<br>states" to arm Georgia emboldened leaders in Tbilisi to 
<br>launch its attack against South Ossetia. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) Speeches by Duma party faction leaders took on a 
<br>very anti-Georgian and anti-American tone. Communist leader 
<br>Zyuganov and LDPR leader Zhirinovskiy specifically accused 
<br>the U.S. of having precipitated the attack on South Ossetia 
<br>by arming and training Georgian military forces, and that 
<br>U.S. motives included destabilizing Russia and controlling 
<br>energy transit routes from the Caucasus and the Caspian 
<br>regions. Vice President Cheney was accused of coordinating 
<br>the anti-Russian, pro-Georgian campaign. Zhirinovskiy 
<br>alleged that Israel had intended to attack Iran just prior to 
<br>the U.S. elections, and that the Georgian military strike now 
<br>disrupted that plan. In the end, the lower house also 
<br>adopted the appeals to Medvedev (for Russian recognition) and 
<br>to the UN and UN member states unanimously. 
<br>
<br>Not So Fast 
<br>----------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) In the days just prior to the special session of 
<br>Parliament, experts and academicians filled newspapers and 
<br>airwaves with concern for the political consequences of 
<br>recognition. While conceding that public sentiment has been 
<br>affected by the events in South Ossetia, esteemed figures 
<br>including former Ambassadors Adamishin and Lukin urged 
<br>Medvedev to hold off on recognition. They argued that 
<br>Moscow's diplomatic hand has been strengthened as a result of 
<br>"Georgian aggression" and Russia's decisive victory in the 
<br>war, and that now was not the time to consign the two 
<br>entities to the same fate as Northern Cyprus, i.e. to being 
<br>recognized by only one other country. 
<br>
<br>Now What? 
<br>--------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) There was little doubt that the legislative moves were 
<br>coordinated by the Kremlin. The question remains, though, 
<br>for what purpose? XXXXXXXXXXXX that the same Duma 
<br>that had said nothing during the war, and had also not been 
<br>called back earlier from its August recess, was now being 
<br>used by the Kremlin to further muddy international waters and 
<br>to give the Kremlin another card to play with European 
<br>mediators. The Federation Council and Duma were already on 
<br>
<br>record (as of March, 2008) as supporting independence for 
<br>Abkhazia and South Ossetia. By orchestrating a solid show of 
<br>support for independence from the parliament, she contended, 
<br>the Kremlin can take a tougher line with respect to drawing 
<br>back Russian forces to pre-August 7 lines of demarcation. 
<br>Expecting that disputes over interpretation and 
<br>implementation of Point 6 of the Medvedev-Sarkozy cease-fire 
<br>agreement will continue with Europe and the U.S., the Kremlin 
<br>can now either move to recognize, declaring that it cannot 
<br>stand in the way of strong public sentiment, or it can argue 
<br>for acceptance of its interpretation of Point 6. In either 
<br>case, Medvedev will be able to demonstrate to the world and 
<br>to the Russian public that, having weathered the storm of 
<br>world criticism, he took quick action before opportunities 
<br>created by military action faded away.  XXXXXXXXXXXX suggested that 
<br>factors that might restrain Medvedev from immediately 
<br>recognizing included positive signals from Europe, and a 
<br>desire to await the outcome of U.S. presidential elections. 
<br>Even if he chooses to wait, the parliamentary show will still 
<br>give Russian diplomats enough cover to take tough positions 
<br>on the future of Abkhazia and South Ossetia at the OSCE and 
<br>the UN for months to come. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C)  XXXXXXXXXXXX did not anticipate Medvedev approving recognition in the immediate term. Acknowledging that supporting independence 
<br>was not in Russia's objective interests, XXXXXXXXXXXX said 
<br>Medvedev's decision would be driven by other factors. 
<br>Medvedev, he argued, would use the vote to build pressure for 
<br>an international mechanism that met Russia's bottom line. In 
<br>particular, he argued that Russia sought a UNSCR confirming 
<br>its status as peacekeeper in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and 
<br>expected the international community to halt its unqualified 
<br>support for President Saakashvili. Otherwise, he intimated, 
<br>recognition of the two entities might be expedited. He cited 
<br>an interview given by Saakashvili in recent days in which the 
<br>Georgian leader reportedly declared that he would strive not 
<br>to convince South Ossetians to "come back to Georgia," but 
<br>that "Georgia would come to them (e.g., militarily)."  XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>charged that this only further confirmed Saakashvili's future 
<br>military intentions against South Ossetia and the need to 
<br>ensure that the Georgian military never launches a military 
<br>attack against the region again. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Comment: The Duma and Federation Council's actions 
<br>will be used by the Kremlin and the MFA in dealings with 
<br>foreign intermediaries to demonstrate strong broad support 
<br>for even tougher measures regarding the two regions, and to 
<br>further ratchet up pressure against the Saakashvili 
<br>government. Despite the unanimous votes, Medvedev and Putin 
<br>can play the recognition game out further, increasing 
<br>pressure on European allies to compromise on a 
<br>Russian-preferred UNSC draft resolution while avoiding a step 
<br>that -  XXXXXXXXXXXX's bravado aside - could have unpredictable 
<br>consequences in Russian domestic terms.
