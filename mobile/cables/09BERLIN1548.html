<br>SUBJECT: GERMANY RENEWS CONSIDERATION OF GUANTANAMO 
<br>DETAINEES FOR RESETTLEMENT 
<br> 
<br>REF: A. STATE 50242 
<br>     ¶B. BERLIN 600 
<br>     ¶C. BERLIN 625 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Philip D. Murphy for reasons 1.4 (b,d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (C/NF) Summary: In separate December 1 meetings with 
<br>Ambassador Dan Fried, Special Envoy for Closure of the 
<br>Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility (S/GC), the Ministry of the 
<br>Interior, Foreign Ministry and Chancellery expressed a 
<br>willingness to consider seven new cases of Guantanamo 
<br>detainees for resettlement as well as three cases that had 
<br>already been provided to the former government last spring. 
<br>All interlocutors stressed that the MOI is the competent 
<br>ministry handling this issue.  They also expressed the desire 
<br>to be helpful in the spirit of the strong U.S.-German 
<br>bilateral relationship.  Interior Ministry State Secretary 
<br>Beus said that any decision on the cases would likely take up 
<br>to two months and agreed with S/E Fried on the following way 
<br>forward: 
<br> 
<br>-- the Interior Ministry would be the only ministry 
<br>addressing this issue, especially in regard to sharing 
<br>information on the detainees; 
<br>-- the U.S. and Germany will uphold strict confidentiality 
<br>during this review phase and coordinate timing and content of 
<br>any public messages; 
<br>-- while Germany prefers non-Uighur cases because of expected 
<br>tension with China, it will consider the cases of two Uighurs 
<br>based on humanitarian grounds; 
<br>-- Germany prefers to accept detainees with a connection to 
<br>Germany, which S/E Fried explained to be the case with only 
<br>one detainee, a Tunisian whose file was previously provided; 
<br>-- the German MOI will maintain direct communication with 
<br>S/GC at this stage in the process; 
<br>-- Germany will decide on the need to interview any 
<br>candidates at the end of its review process. 
<br> 
<br>In a later meeting, Chancellery Security Advisor Christoph 
<br>Heusgen stressed his confidence in Interior Minister Thomas 
<br>de Maiziere to handle this issue, noting de Maiziere's close 
<br>relationship with Chancellor Merkel.  End summary. 
<br> 
<br>Interior Ministry is Key 
<br>------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (C/NF) Based on a schedule recommended by the 
<br>Chancellery, S/E Fried and Ambassador Murphy met first with 
<br>Interior Ministry State Secretary Beus and expressed 
<br>appreciation for the new government's willingness to consider 
<br>resettling detainees.  S/E Fried reviewed the numerous 
<br>European countries which had accepted or pledged to resettle 
<br>detainees at this point, noting that progress has been made 
<br>but more is needed.  He noted he would only be passing along 
<br>detainee dossiers to the MOI and discussing case specifics 
<br>with the MOI, and not with other Government ministries, per 
<br>earlier requests from the government.  S/E Fried handed over 
<br>the dossiers of seven detainees: two Egyptians, two Syrians, 
<br>a Libyan, and two Palestinians.  He explained that if the MOI 
<br>has questions or requires additional information, it can do 
<br>so through established liaison channels and additionally 
<br>offered for a German team to visit Guantanamo to conduct 
<br>interviews with detainees under consideration.  While 
<br>recognizing Germany's preference for non-Uighur detainees, 
<br>S/E Fried raised two Uighur cases for consideration based on 
<br>humanitarian grounds, one who has psychological problems and 
<br>the other, his brother, who serves as a caregiver.  He also 
<br>acknowledged the German interest in detainees who have some 
<br>connection to Germany, noting the one Tunisian case whose 
<br>file had been conveyed last spring as the single detainee 
<br>with those ties to Germany.  In total, S/E Fried requested 
<br>that Germany consider 10 detainee cases for resettlement, 
<br>three cases already conveyed and seven new cases. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C/NF) State Secretary Beus expressed his ministry's 
<br>willingness to consider all the cases, including the Uighurs, 
<br>and said that his experts would review the files as soon as 
<br>possible.  Shortly after he began, Interior Minister Thomas 
<br>de Maiziere dropped in to stress his desire to be of help. 
<br>Continuing, Beus underlined the importance of keeping the 
<br>current discussions and review of the detainees confidential, 
<br>to which S/E Fried strongly agreed.  Beus underlined 
<br>Germany's preference for detainees who have some ties to 
<br>Germany, noting that this connection would provide the 
<br>government with a "plausible" explanation for accepting 
<br>certain detainees when faced with the argument that the U.S. 
<br>should be resettling them.  Beus said that he would be 
<br>willing to consider the two Uighur cases on humanitarian 
<br>grounds, but noted that they would present special 
<br>difficulties because of the diplomatic row which would likely 
<br> 
<br>ensue.  Beus also highlighted that even if the federal 
<br>government agrees to accept any detainees, it must then find 
<br>a German state willing to accept them.  He also said that 
<br>German services would naturally keep an eye on any resettle 
<br>detainees within reasonable resource means. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (C/NF) Beus also expressed strong interest in 
<br>coordinating the timing and content of any public message on 
<br>Germany's consideration of and decision on resettling 
<br>detainees to prevent political pressure from those who oppose 
<br>the move, but regardless the government will advocate in 
<br>public in favor of taking detainees if they come to a 
<br>positive decision.  He added that being able to say to the 
<br>public that the U.S. has also accepted detainees or otherwise 
<br>explain why the U.S. is not doing so would also be helpful. 
<br>S/E Fried expressed his readiness to coordinate and noted 
<br>that the U.S. has admitted and plans to admit the more 
<br>dangerous detainees for legal proceedings. 
<br> 
<br>Process and Timeframe 
<br>--------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (C/NF) Beus said that he and his experts would review the 
<br>files and determine if additional information is needed.  He 
<br>agreed that additional information would go through 
<br>intelligence channels and expressed his preference to 
<br>communicate directly with S/E Fried on any matters at this 
<br>stage of the process.  He said that they would decide whether 
<br>interviews are necessary when the experts have completed 
<br>their review of the information.  He estimated that a 
<br>decision on taking detainees would take one-to-two months. 
<br> 
<br>MFA Plays Peripheral Role 
<br>------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (C/NF) It was clear from the later meeting with MFA State 
<br>Secretary Wolf Born that the Foreign Office would not be a 
<br>major decision-maker as on this issue.  S/E Fried reviewed in 
<br>general terms the cases of detainees that we are asking the 
<br>MOI to consider and also highlighted the humanitarian nature 
<br>of the two Uighur cases, which Born noted.  Born said that 
<br>Foreign Minister Westerwelle wants to be "positive," but 
<br>added that it is the MOI which is the "competent" ministry on 
<br>this issue.  Born mainly asked questions about the numbers of 
<br>detainees still at Guantanamo, U.S. plans for addressing the 
<br>various groups, and the possible closing date, all of which 
<br>S/E Fried discussed with him. 
<br> 
<br>Chancellery Confirms Reticence about Uighurs 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (C/NF) In the last meeting, Chancellery Security and 
<br>Foreign Policy Advisor Christoph Heusgen expressed 
<br>appreciation that S/E Fried had proceeded along the lines 
<br>that the MOI and Chancellery had requested through Ambassador 
<br>Murphy.  Heusgen appeared to be already fully briefed on S/E 
<br>Fried's earlier meeting that day with Beus.  He told S/E 
<br>Fried that if Germany were to take any Uighurs, it would be 
<br>best to do so in combination with other European countries to 
<br>prevent China from focusing its opposition on any one 
<br>country.  Heusgen was not optimistic that China would 
<br>demonstrate any understanding for the two humanitarian cases. 
<br> Heusgen inquired as to whether any alternatives for the 
<br>Uighurs exists.  S/E Fried explained possible options, while 
<br>highlighting the difficulty of resettling the two individuals 
<br>he is asking Germany to consider. 
<br> 
<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (C/NF) The new government, now in place since October 29, 
<br>appears willing to renew consideration of resettling GTMO 
<br>detainees and has expressed a clear desire to be of help.  In 
<br>contrast to former Interior Minister Schaeuble, current MOI 
<br>de Maiziere has not (and is unlikely to) flouted security 
<br>concerns about cases in the press, nor indicated that Germany 
<br>would be hardpressed to accept any detainees put forth for 
<br>security reasons.  Nor has de Maiziere indicated that the 
<br>fact that the U.S. itself has not resettled detainees 
<br>presents an insurmountable roadblock, although Beus indicated 
<br>that U.S. resettlement would help Germany's PR efforts to 
<br>resettle.  All interlocutors expressed a strong interest in 
<br>keeping the matter confidential and coordinating the timing 
<br>and content of any public message.  Beus projected sincerity 
<br>and realism, noting that even if the federal government 
<br>agrees, it must still identify a state that is willing to 
<br>resettle the detainees.  While all interlocutors did not 
<br>outright reject the two Uighur cases, Heusgen made clear that 
<br>the prospect of being the only European country to irritate 
<br>China by accepting Uighurs would make it difficult, although 
<br> 
<br>it is unclear whether Germany would take part in any broader 
<br>European decision to resettle Uighurs. 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (SBU) There has to date been no mention in the press of 
<br>S/E Fried's visit. 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (U) This cable has been cleared by S/E Dan Fried.
