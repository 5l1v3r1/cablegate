<br>
<br>SUMMARY 
<br>-------- 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) Ambassador met with Assistant Minister of Defense 
<br>and Aviation Prince Khaled bin Sultan to relay U.S. concerns 
<br>about sharing USG imagery with Saudi Arabia in light of 
<br>evidence that Saudi aircraft may have struck civilian targets 
<br>during its fighting with the Houthis in northern Yemen. 
<br>Prince Khaled described the targeting decision-making process 
<br>and while not denying that civilian targets might have been 
<br>hit, gave unequivocal assurances that Saudi Arabia considered 
<br>it a priority to avoid strikes against civilian targets. 
<br>Based on the assurances received from Prince Khaled, the 
<br>Ambassador has approved, as authorized in reftel, the 
<br>provision of USG imagery of the Yemeni border area to the 
<br>Saudi Government. End summary. 
<br>
<br>USG CONCERNS ABOUT POSSIBLE STRIKES ON CIVILIAN TARGETS 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) Ambassador Smith delivered points in reftel to 
<br>Prince Khaled on February 6, 2010. The Ambassador 
<br>highlighted USG concerns about providing Saudi Arabia with 
<br>satellite imagery of the Yemen border area absent greater 
<br>certainty that Saudi Arabia was and would remain fully in 
<br>compliance with the laws of armed conflict during the conduct 
<br>of military operations, particularly regarding attacks on 
<br>civilian targets. The Ambassador noted the USG's specific 
<br>concern about an apparent Saudi air strike on a building that 
<br>the U.S. believed to be a Yemeni medical clinic. The 
<br>Ambassador showed Prince Khaled a satellite image of the 
<br>bomb-damaged building in question. 
<br>
<br>IF WE HAD THE PREDATOR, THIS MIGHT NOT HAVE HAPPENED 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) Upon seeing the photograph, Prince Khalid remarked, 
<br>"This looks familiar," and added, "if we had the Predator, 
<br>maybe we would not have this problem." He noted that Saudi 
<br>Air Force operations were necessarily being conducted without 
<br>the desired degree of precision, and recalled that a clinic 
<br>had been struck, based on information received from Yemen 
<br>that it was being used as an operational base by the Houthis. 
<br>Prince Khalid explained the Saudi approach to its fight with 
<br>the Houthis, emphasizing that the Saudis had to hit the 
<br>Houthis very hard in order to "bring them to their knees" and 
<br>compel them to come to terms with the Yemeni government. 
<br>"However," he said, "we tried very hard not to hit civilian 
<br>targets." The Saudis had 130 deaths and the Yemenis lost as 
<br>many as one thousand. "Obviously," Prince Khaled observed, 
<br>"some civilians died, though we wish that this did not 
<br>happen." 
<br>
<br>HOW THE TARGETS WERE SELECTED 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) Prince Khaled gave the Ambassador further 
<br>background, explaining that the targets given to the Saudi 
<br>Air Force were studied and recommended by a Saudi-Yemeni 
<br>joint committee headed by Saudi and Yemeni general officers. 
<br>That joint committee reported to him, and no targets were 
<br>struck unless they had clearance from this joint committee. 
<br>"Did they make mistakes? Possibly." Prince Khaled also 
<br>reported that the Saudis had problems with some of the 
<br>targeting recommendations received from the Yemeni side. For 
<br>instance, there was one occasion when Saudi pilots aborted a 
<br>strike, when they sensed something was wrong about the 
<br>information they received from the Yemenis. It turned out 
<br>that the site recommended to be hit was the headquarters of 
<br>General Ali Mohsen Al-Ahmar, the Yemeni northern area 
<br>military commander, who is regarded as a political opponent 
<br>to President Saleh. This incident prompted the Saudis to be 
<br>more cautious about targeting recommendations from the Yemeni 
<br>government. 
<br>
<br>CEASEFIRE COMING SOON 
<br>--------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) The Ambassador told Prince Khaled that the USG is 
<br>looking to Saudi Arabia to help bring an end to the Houthi 
<br>fighting soon. Prince Khaled responded that Saudi Arabia is 
<br>"looking for ways to end this conflict in a way that fosters 
<br>good relations." He said that he met with President Saleh 
<br>last Wednesday to discuss Houthi ceasefire terms, and they 
<br>agreed that, so long as the Houthis deliver on the terms they 
<br>offered, there should be news about a ceasefire "within a 
<br>
<br>week." As part of the ceasefire arrangements the Yemeni 
<br>military will be deployed on the Yemeni side of the border to 
<br>prevent future Houthi incursions into Saudi Arabia. "Then," 
<br>Prince Khaled noted, "we can concentrate on Al-Qaida." 
<br>
<br>COMMENT 
<br>------ 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) Prince Khaled, in addressing the Ambassador's 
<br>concerns about possible targeting of civilian sites appeared 
<br>neither defensive nor evasive. He was unequivocal in his 
<br>assurance that Saudi military operations had been and would 
<br>continue to be conducted with priority to avoiding civilian 
<br>casualties. The Ambassador found this assurance credible, 
<br>all the more so in light of Prince Khaled's acknowledgment 
<br>that mistakes likely happened during the strikes against 
<br>Houthi targets, of the inability of the Saudi Air Force to 
<br>operate with adequate precision, and the unreliability of 
<br>Yemeni targeting recommendations. Based on these assurances, 
<br>the Ambassador has approved, as authorized in reftel, the 
<br>provision of USG imagery of the Yemeni border area to the 
<br>Saudi Government. While the fighting with the Houthis 
<br>appears to be drawing to a close, the imagery will be of 
<br>continuing value to the Saudi military to monitor and prevent 
<br>Houthi incursions across the border as well as enhancing 
<br>Saudi capabilities against Al-Qaeda activities in this area.
