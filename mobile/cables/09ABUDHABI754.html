<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (S) Summary: Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed (MbZ, also 
<br>Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces and de facto defense 
<br>chief) hosted a July 19 executive session of the Gulf Security 
<br>Dialogue in Abu Dhabi (July 20 plenary with UAE uniformed officers 
<br>reported septel).  The U.S. delegation was led by Assistant Secretary 
<br>of Defense for International Security Affairs Alexander Vershbow and 
<br>Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs Andrew 
<br>Shapiro.  MbZ called for advanced U.S.-UAE joint military 
<br>coordination and faster delivery of FMS items to respond to a 
<br>worst-case scenario in Iran.  As with other senior U.S. officials 
<br>(but with increasing alarm and a shortening time frame), MbZ focused 
<br>on the Iranian threat and his belief that an Israeli pre-emptive 
<br>strike on Iran is likely in a matter of months.  ASD Vershbow assured 
<br>MbZ of the U.S. commitment to UAE security; A/S Shapiro relayed that 
<br>this visit was his first since taking his new position - reflecting 
<br>the importance we place on the relationship.  Discussions also 
<br>centered on UAE military and humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan 
<br>and Pakistan and the peace process.   End summary. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (SBU) Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed (MbZ) hosted a 
<br>working dinner with U.S. Gulf Security Dialogue delegation the 
<br>evening of July 19.  The U.S. Delegation was led by Assistant 
<br>Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs Andrew Shapiro and 
<br>Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs 
<br>Alexander Vershbow and included RADM William Payne, Ambassador, and 
<br>DCM.  The UAE was represented by Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces 
<br>Hamad Thani al-Rumaithi, Ambassador to the U.S. Yousef al-Otaiba, 
<br>Under Secretary of the Crown Prince's Court Mohamed al-Mazrouei, 
<br>Deputy Chief of Staff Ali Hamad al-Kaabi and Air Force Chief Mohammed 
<br>Swaidan al-Qamzi. 
<br> 
<br>Joint Planning for Worst-Case Scenario in Iran 
<br>--------------------------------------------- - 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S) In a three-hour working dinner, MbZ focused primarily on his 
<br>overarching concern -- the threat from Iran, stressing as he has with 
<br>other senior U.S. officials that U.S. engagement with Iran will 
<br>ultimately fail and that he fears a surprise (Israeli pre-emptive 
<br>strike on Iran) in a shorter timeframe than USG estimates (he fears 
<br>it could happen this year).  ASD Vershbow assured MbZ of the U.S. 
<br>commitment to UAE security; A/S Shapiro relayed that his trip to the 
<br>UAE was his first since taking on his new position, reflecting the 
<br>importance we place on the relationship. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (S/NF) MbZ reiterated his belief that an Israeli pre-emptive 
<br>strike against Iran was increasingly likely, saying he was convinced 
<br>the Netanyahu government was prepared to act against Iran, and that 
<br>he agreed with Israeli intelligence assessments regarding how close 
<br>Tehran is to achieving its nuclear ambitions.  The Iranian response 
<br>to a pre-emptive strike, predicted MbZ, would be attacks on U.S. 
<br>allies in the region, foremost among them the UAE; Iran may also 
<br>unleash terrorist cells against western interests around the world. 
<br>ASD Vershbow explained that the USG assessment differed in timeframe 
<br>-- we do not anticipate military confrontation with Iran before the 
<br>end of 2009 -- stressing, however, that denying Iran's nuclear 
<br>ambitions and stemming its efforts to achieve regional hegemony were 
<br>foremost among U.S. international security concerns. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (S) In response to MbZ's position that ultimately engagement 
<br>efforts with Iran would fail, both ASD and A/S  made clear than while 
<br>the USG continues to press for a diplomatic solution, the offer of 
<br>engagement is not opened-ended and will not come at the expense of 
<br>Gulf security. 
<br> 
<br>ABU DHABI 00000754  002 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (S) Referring to the Iran Region Presence Office (IRPO) in Dubai, 
<br>MbZ asked "how's that office doing?"  He did not demonstrate any 
<br>particular concern or sensitivity regarding IRPO activities in UAE. 
<br>MbZ said that the Iranian regime was in trouble internally and would 
<br>move swiftly to oppress post-election opposition.  As for Rafsanjani, 
<br>MbZ said he was a "survivor" who would not succeed in a leadership 
<br>bid because he will not act unless he is one-hundred percent sure he 
<br>will win.  Again turning to his primary security concern, MbZ 
<br>suggested that Tehran would likely accelerate its nuclear program to 
<br>draw attention away from its internal weakness and to foment 
<br>nationalism among its citizenry.  "Time is not on our side", he said, 
<br>hinting that a move should be made against Iran and "the sooner the 
<br>better." 
<br> 
<br>Russia 
<br>------ 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C)ASD Vershbow briefed MbZ on the positive outcome of POTUS's 
<br>recent talks in Moscow.  MbZ said that he had met with Putin in June 
<br>and he did not believe Russia saw a nuclearized Iran as a challenge 
<br>to its interests, nor did Putin appreciate the threat of regional 
<br>proliferation in response to an Iranian bomb.  He encouraged the U.S. 
<br>to continue to press the Russians saying he believed if the Russians 
<br>came over to our side, (with regard to tougher sanctions), the 
<br>Chinese would follow.  MbZ said his he would travel in late July to 
<br>Beijing, where he will surely press the Chinese on Iran.  ASD 
<br>Vershbow suggested he urge the Chinese to send Iran a message by 
<br>diversifying its oil imports away from Iran. 
<br> 
<br>Afghanistan - Neighbors Not Doing Enough 
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (S/NF) MbZ complained that Arab regimes are not doing enough to 
<br>help in Afghanistan.  He said that as of one month ago, he surveyed 
<br>the region and found that only Oman had funded its Tokyo conference 
<br>pledge of $2 million.  He singled out Saudi Arabia and Qatar in 
<br>particular for not doing their part, saying that the Saudis clearly 
<br>did not see how important it was to their own interests. 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (S/NF) MbZ criticized other regional leaders for playing both 
<br>sides and for "dating" Iran.  MbZ compared the current situation to 
<br>pre-WWII Europe saying, "Ahmedinejad is Hitler," and neighboring 
<br>capitals believe erroneously that they can prevent Iranian 
<br>retaliation by playing nice or signing agreements with Tehran.  "They 
<br>think the are backing the winning horse," MbZ explained, emphasizing 
<br>that if they think that by appeasing Iran they will avoid Iranian 
<br>retaliation "then they are seriously mistaken, Sir." 
<br> 
<br>National Defense Strategy 
<br>------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (S) Throughout the discussions, MbZ repeatedly called for 
<br>coordinated military planning for the worst-case scenario of an 
<br>unpredictable Iranian response to an Israeli strike, stressing that 
<br>U.S.-UAE preparations must begin now well before commencement of 
<br>hostilities.  Both sides agreed that improved coordination was a good 
<br>idea, with ASD Vershbow utilizing the opportunity to push for a UAE 
<br>national defense strategy.  (Note: GSD July 20 plenary meeting 
<br>reported septel.  End Note.) 
<br> 
<br>Pakistan - 14 Additional PUMAs 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (C) Passing a letter from Secretary Clinton thanking the UAE for 
<br>its transfer of 14 U.S.-origin PUMA helicopters to Pakistan, A/S 
<br>Shapiro thanked MbZ for the UAEG's partnership and regional 
<br>leadership in providing assistance to Pakistan as well as its 
<br>long-term participation in the coalition in Afghanistan.  MbZ updated 
<br>the delegation on delivery status, saying that 10 of the promised 14 
<br> 
<br>ABU DHABI 00000754  003 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>had been delivered and the remaining 4 would shortly follow.  He 
<br>added that efforts were underway to find and purchase additional 
<br>helicopters, announcing (for the first time that we have heard this) 
<br>the UAE's intentions to provide Pakistan with an additional 14 PUMAs. 
<br> 
<br>Humanitarian Aid for CT 
<br>----------------------- 
<br>¶12. (C) In the context of defeating AQ in Afghanistan and Pakistan, 
<br>MbZ called for Arab and Muslim regimes to do more to stem terrorist 
<br>financing, whether it means closing down charities, business 
<br>interests, "whatever is necessary."  He also pointed to the 
<br>zealousness of Arab fighters vice Afghani nationals.  Nine-five 
<br>percent of Arab fighters go to Afghanistan knowing they are going to 
<br>die for ideological reasons.  Afghan nationals, on the other hand, 
<br>are more practical.  "This makes one of them [Arabs] more valuable to 
<br>AQ than ten or more Afghan fighters."  Afghanis, MbZ pointed out, 
<br>have tribes, families, homes -- therefore the best way to counter 
<br>local extremism in Afghanistan, and to a lesser extent Pakistan, is 
<br>to improve the quality of life. 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (SBU) MbZ described UAE humanitarian commitments of $300 million 
<br>to build "model villages" in Afghanistan, complete with housing, 
<br>hospitals and schools.  He invited the USG to join the UAE, Germany 
<br>and France in this effort.  A/S Shapiro stressed the urgency of the 
<br>displaced persons crisis in the Swat region of Pakistan, suggesting 
<br>the UAE consider housing aid in this region.  MbZ replied "Why not? 
<br>We will try to help wherever needed." 
<br> 
<br>MbZ on Pakistani Leadership 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶14. (S/NF) MbZ shared his assessment of the current Pakistani 
<br>leadership saying President "Zardarni is dirty but not dangerous," 
<br>while Prime Minister Sharif is "dangerous but not dirty -- this is 
<br>Pakistan.  Sharif cannot be trusted to honor his promises.  MbZ 
<br>continued that a new personality may emerge but for the time being 
<br>the UAE position was to play a helpful role by supporting the PM. 
<br> 
<br>Lebanon - Support for LAF and PM Hariri 
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶15. (C) ASD Vershbow reiterated our request that the UAEG assist the 
<br>Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) by funding the purchase and transfer of 
<br>some of 56 U.S.-origin tanks from Jordan to Lebanon, noting our 
<br>appreciation of the UAE's earlier funding of the first 10 tanks. 
<br>This would help capitalize on the positive outcome of the elections 
<br>and help reduce Hezbollah's (and Iran's) influence in Lebanon. 
<br>Promising to look into what the UAE could do to help with this 
<br>matter, MbZ asked if we had made the same request to Doha.  ASD 
<br>replied that we had and that he would do so again when he arrived in 
<br>Qatar July 20. 
<br> 
<br>¶16. (C) Reiterating his favored theme of the generation gap in 
<br>regional leadership (UAE having already passed the baton to the 
<br>younger generation), MbZ praised Lebanese PM Saad Hariri, saying he 
<br>was a good man.  "He feels very threatened at the moment (presumably 
<br>by the Syrian regime), and it is important we do not lose him."  A/S 
<br>Shapiro agreed, pointing to U.S. security assistance as proof of our 
<br>concern and suggested that the UAE support U.S. efforts to strengthen 
<br>Lebanese government institutions as the best opportunity to build GOL 
<br>stability and security. 
<br> 
<br>July 18 Nasrallah Speech 
<br>------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶17. (S) MbZ pointed to Hezbollah SYG Hassan Nasrallah's July 18 
<br>speech, saying he believed it reflected a change in Hezbollah's tone 
<br>due to calculations that its Iranian backers were currently in a 
<br>weakened state post-Presidential elections.  MbZ said that Nasrallah 
<br>is likely suffering from decreased financial support, at least for 
<br> 
<br>ABU DHABI 00000754  004 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>the next six months. 
<br> 
<br>Behavior Change in Syria - I Think Not 
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶18. (S/NF) Vershbow pointed to recent progress with Syria on border 
<br>control issues to stem the flow of foreign fighters to Iraq as a 
<br>small step forward in effort at eliciting behavioral change from 
<br>Damascus.  MbZ showed no confidence that Syria could be separated 
<br>from the Iranian camp.  "If you want my opinion," replied MbZ, "I 
<br>think not."  He advised that Syria had a lot of options and that, 
<br>judging from past behavior, the regime would continue hedging on key 
<br>regional issues (Iran, support for Hezbollah, peace process) for the 
<br>foreseeable future. 
<br> 
<br>Praise for Bahraini Crown Prince 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶19. (C) MbZ said that a two-state solution was the only option for 
<br>solving the Israeli-Palestinian issue.  MbZ praised the Bahraini 
<br>Crown Prince Sheikh Salman bin Hamad al Khalifa for his "courageous" 
<br>(July 17) editorial in the Washington Post (ref B), commenting that 
<br>not enough Arab countries we on the right side of this issue. 
<br> 
<br>¶20. (U) ASD Vershbow and A/S Shapiro cleared this message.<br>
