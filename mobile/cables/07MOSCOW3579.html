<br>Summary
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Ramzan Kadyrov recently celebrated his 100th day as
<br>President of Chechnya. Characteristics of the new order are
<br>already visible:
<br>
<br>-- The appointment of personnel who have no loyalties except
<br>to Kadyrov, and the steady elimination of those with
<br>independent ties to Moscow or independent bases of support
<br>there.
<br>
<br>-- An improvement in the economic situation, as well as in
<br>human rights (marginally), as Kadyrov centralizes power and
<br>independent actors (read: rent-seekers and kidnappers) are
<br>reined in and franchised by his administration.
<br>
<br>-- Kadyrov's "extraterritorial" efforts to speak for Chechens
<br>everywhere, not just in Chechnya.
<br>
<br>-- Regional power aspirations, focusing first on
<br>re-integrating Ingushetia.
<br>
<br>Kadyrov faces hurdles on the way to these goals, including
<br>both dissension within Chechnya's ruling elite and the
<br>uncertainties in the run-up to the 2008 Russian presidential
<br>transition. Without buying into either Kadyrov or his motives
<br>(or dealing with him personally), the U.S. should seek ways
<br>to engage the people of Chechnya, who lack exposure to the
<br>outside world.
<br>
<br>End Summary.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Ramzan Kadyrov celebrated his hundredth day as
<br>President of Chechnya on July 14. For three years before
<br>that he had been the Republic's strongman, with backing from
<br>President Putin that has seen no limits. Putin promoted
<br>Kadyrov shortly after the latter gunned down rival Movladi
<br>Baysarov -- an FSB lieutenant colonel -- in broad daylight on
<br>a major Moscow street. According to a Presidential
<br>Administration staffer, Putin ascribes the success of his
<br>Chechnya policies to his unlimited backing of Kadyrov.
<br>Assumption of the Chechen presidency should just have been a
<br>bonus. Nonetheless, tendencies visible before Kadyrov became
<br>president have become concrete.
<br>
<br>Cutting Out the Competition
<br>---------------------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Chechnya has been a mass of federal structures, each
<br>representing its own institutional interests and, often,
<br>competing clans within those institutions. For the three
<br>years before Kadyrov became president, President Alkhanov
<br>and, until his resignation, Prime Minister Abramov, each had
<br>independent ties to Moscow and bases of support there. The
<br>"siloviki," or "power ministries" -- FSB, MVD, MOD -- hate
<br>Kadyrov,xxxxx told us, and
<br>representatives of each try to work with Chechen factions not
<br>loyal to Kadyrov. A good example is ORB-2, the descendant
<br>of the RUBOP, the directorate designed to fight organized
<br>crime. When RUBOP was broken up (it had itself become an
<br>organized crime family) it was integrated into local MVD
<br>offices -- but not in Chechnya. There it was subordinated to
<br>the Southern District MVD in Rostov, to ensure an MVD
<br>presence outside Kadyrov's control.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) All that is changing. When Kadyrov assumed the
<br>presidency there was speculation that Putin would insist on
<br>the appointment of a Prime Minister with a independent power
<br>base, such as Federation Council member Umar Dzhabrailov.
<br>Instead, Kadyrov promoted his maternal cousin Odes
<br>Baysultanov to the job (he had been First Deputy). Kadyrov
<br>named his chief enforcer and right-hand man, Adam
<br>Delimkhanov, as First Deputy Prime Minister. It was
<br>Delimkhanov who traveled to Moscow to pull the trigger on
<br>Baysarov.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Kadyrov has accused ORB-2 of involvement in kidnapping
<br>and torture, and is militating for the group's withdrawal
<br>from Chechnya. ORB-2 certainly carries out some of these
<br>crimes, but by accusing them Kadyrov is trying both to
<br>exculpate himself and rid Chechnya of a structure not under
<br>his control. According to Presidential Administration
<br>staffer Aleksandr Machevskiy, overall force levels in
<br>Chechnya now stand at 35,000, about half of whom are local
<br>Chechens -- most of whom are under Kadyrov's personal
<br>control. Trouble is already brewing between Kadyrov and two
<br>of Chechnya's most powerful warlords, Sulim Yamadayev of the
<br>
<br>Moscow 00003579 002 of 005
<br>
<br>
<br>"East" Battalion (see below) and Said-Magomad Kakiyev of the
<br>"West" battalion, four of whose men were killed in a recent
<br>shoot-out with Kadyrov's security forces.
<br>
<br>Rebuilding Chechnya
<br>-------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) The centralization of presidential power under Kadyrov
<br>has had positive effects on Chechnya's economic and human
<br>rights situation, as we have reported (reftels). The human
<br>rights watchdog Memorial has documented an 80 percent drop in
<br>abductions over the last year, as Kadyrov, exercising the
<br>"state monopoly on violence," eliminates or neutralizes
<br>kidnappers not working under his direct sanction -- and he
<br>now rarely feels the need to kidnap for either economic or
<br>political reasons. Human rights improvement has its limits,
<br>however. Kadyrov's own "vertical of power," together with
<br>his cult of personality, mean that freedom of the Chechen
<br>media is not likely anytime soon.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Chechnya's economy also owes its renewal to Kadyrov's
<br>monopoly on violence. In the past, government subsidies were
<br>basically bribes to keep Chechnya quiet, given on the
<br>understanding that that Kadyrov would pocket any funds that
<br>made it to Chechnya past the trough of officials through
<br>which it had to flow after leaving the Treasury. The
<br>economies of Dagestan and Ingushetia still run more or less
<br>on these lines, the latter almost exclusively so. Kadyrov
<br>still keeps the subsidies, but now forces other Chechens to
<br>contribute to rebuilding infrastructure. Derided as the
<br>grand projects are for their facade-deep garishness, they are
<br>still an improvement over the vast desolation that the
<br>Russians made and called "peace."
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Chechnya is still a profit center for the federal
<br>government, despite the missing subsidies. A Chechen
<br>xxxxx told us
<br>that Chechnya pays more income tax into the federal treasury
<br>than neighboring Dagestan, which has nearly three times the
<br>population (a tribute to Kadyrov's persuasiveness?). One
<br>federal moneymaker that Kadyrov is trying to "devolve" is
<br>oil. At present, the Chechen xxxxx told us, Rosneft
<br>spends Rs 800-900 million per year in Chechnya to produce oil
<br>it sells for Rs 30 billion. The xxxxx suggested that it
<br>might be advantageous to end subsidies and create a
<br>"Chechneft" analogous to the autonomous subsidiaries of
<br>Rosneft that exist in republics such as Dagestan and
<br>Tatarstan. Kadyrov has put a toe in this pond by contracting
<br>with an American company to recover crude oil from a "lake"
<br>of petroleum runoffs near Groznyy, cleaning up the
<br>environment in the process.
<br>
<br>The Godfather of All the Chechens
<br>---------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Kadyrov is starting to act as the arbiter of disputes
<br>among Chechens outside Chechnya. The prime example is his
<br>intervention in a mafia-style dispute involving his chief
<br>subordinate Sulim Yamadayev, commander of the "East"
<br>Battalion. Yamadayev and some of his men raided the Samson
<br>Meat Factory in St. Petersburg on September 15, 2006
<br>(interesting to speculate how they got there from Chechnya,
<br>fully armed). Yamadayev was apparently acting as enforcer
<br>for a Chechen from Kazakhstan who had an ownership claim that
<br>put him at odds with the factory's manager, also a Chechen.
<br>Charges were pressed by the visibly battered manager, but he
<br>dropped them after two of his brothers were abducted in
<br>Chechnya. This would not have been considered unusual if the
<br>manager were not a well-connected Chechen, but Samson's owner
<br>is the Moscow Industrial Bank, whose president, Abubakar
<br>Arsamakov, is a relative of the plant's manager, and has
<br>clout in the Moscow Chechen community. Perhaps as a result
<br>of his intervention, in late April Kadyrov ordered Yamadayev
<br>to return the missing brothers. Yamadayev protested that he
<br>was not holding them or involved in their disappearance. Our
<br>sources tell us the two brothers are probably sleeping with
<br>the fishes.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) The incident illustrates not only the Russia-wide
<br>reach of Kadyrov; it also fits into his drive to eliminate
<br>potential rivals. Tensions have been close to boiling with
<br>Yamadayev since April. Kadyrov has told a friendly Duma
<br>member that he will not allow Yamadayev's brother Ruslan
<br>"Khalit" Yamadayev to run for re-election as Duma member for
<br>Chechnya. At that point there will be a confrontation.
<br>
<br>Ingathering of Lands
<br>--------------------
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Kadyrov is clearly the strongest figure in the
<br>Caucasus. When earlier this month his 10-year old nephew
<br>crashed a car he was driving (!) and lay in a coma, notables
<br>
<br>Moscow 00003579 003 of 005
<br>
<br>
<br>from all over felt it necessary to make the pilgrimage to
<br>Groznyy to condole with Kadyrov. Like his influence,
<br>Kadyrov's ambitions extend well beyond Chechnya's borders, in
<br>the first instance to its neighbors. Chechen Parliament
<br>Speaker Dukvakha Abdurakhmanov floated the idea of uniting
<br>the three republics of the Northeast Caucasus (Ingushetia,
<br>Chechnya and Dagestan) into one larger unit, in which
<br>Chechens would form the largest single ethnic group. In
<br>addition, Chechen officials sometimes recall longstanding
<br>claims to the Novolak district of Dagestan, which was part of
<br>Chechnya before the 1944 deportations. After the Chechens
<br>were moved out, the Soviets gave the land to ethnic Laks and
<br>changed the borders to keep the Laks (a high percentage of
<br>whom were members of the Communist Party) within Dagestan.
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) The most likely annexation, however, is the
<br>recreation of the pre-Dudayev Checheno-Ingush Republic.
<br>Well-placed sources have told us Kadyrov is moving towards
<br>this goal, and that it solves a few of Moscow's problems, as
<br>well. Ingushetia still has an intractable dispute with North
<br>Ossetia over the Prigorodnyy Rayon, and any leader of
<br>Ingushetia is forced to sound the drums about the issue at
<br>every available opportunity. It would not be so high a
<br>priority on Kadyrov's agenda.
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Reintegration is also a way of getting rid of Ingush
<br>leader Zyazikov, with whom the Kremlin is intensely
<br>dissatisfied, according to xxxxxxxxxxxx. Zyazikov has failed to deal
<br>with the Islamist insurgents -- who, it is well known, have
<br>thoroughly penetrated Ingushetia's security organs. In
<br>addition, his level of corruption, and his shamelessness in
<br>flaunting it, is embarrassing even when compared to other
<br>provincial leaders in the Caucasus.xxxxx told us that Zyazikov recently
<br>hosted xxxxx at dinner in his palace, built by his
<br>predecessor. During the dinner, whose conversation focused
<br>on Ingushetia's dire need for outside humanitarian aid,
<br>Zyazikov mentioned that he was not fond of the palace, and
<br>was going to build another one not far away.
<br>
<br>The Challenges Ahead
<br>--------------------
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) Despite his successes to date in consolidating power,
<br>Kadyrov's path is not strewn with roses. Kadyrov's
<br>neutralization of potential rivals is not cost-free.
<br>Chechens are notoriously independent, and when conditions are
<br>not to their liking, or they are treated with less than the
<br>respect they think is their due, they have an easy place of
<br>refuge: the mountains, with the fighters. Rumor has it that
<br>already 100 of Yamadayev's followers have taken to the hills
<br>with their weapons. As we have reported, the
<br>nationalist-separatist insurgency is nearly dead -- most
<br>fighters were co-opted by Kadyrov and his father; the
<br>remainder scattered and without much capacity to strike. The
<br>Islamist insurgency is thriving, but it is outside Chechnya,
<br>in Dagestan, Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria. But a new,
<br>large injection of disaffected gunmen could breathe new life
<br>into one of these groups, or sweep them up within themselves.
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) Another immediate challenge is the Russian
<br>presidential transition of 2008. Kadyrov's deal with Putin
<br>is a highly personal one. Putin allows, supports and
<br>finances Kadyrov's power and scope of activity in Chechnya,
<br>and agrees to abide by the guarantees of immunity and
<br>impunity Kadyrov has given his 10,000-15,000 fighters, mostly
<br>former rebels like Kadyrov himself. In return, Kadyrov is
<br>personally loyal to Putin and ensures that his fighters turn
<br>their guns on separatists, Islamists and other enemies of the
<br>Russian state. Kadyrov is happy with this arrangement, and
<br>was among the first and loudest to support a third term for
<br>Putin.
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) The succession unleashes unknowns into this cozy
<br>deal. On the most basic level, the chemistry might just not
<br>be right between Kadyrov and Putin's successor. In such an
<br>exceptionally personal deal inside a Russian system already
<br>much more personal and less institutional than its western
<br>counterparts, that lack of personal rapport can have
<br>significant effects. Perhaps for that reason Kadyrov in
<br>April hosted one of the two leading candidates, Dmitriy
<br>Medvedev, on a tour of Groznyy (Presidential Administration
<br>staffer Machevskiy, who was in Chechnya with Medvedev, said
<br>the discussions focused only on the National Projects).
<br>
<br>¶17. (C) Another unknown is what policies the successor will
<br>follow. Most Russian officials we have spoken to tell us
<br>that Kadyrov is a necessity "for now." What happens if the
<br>next Russian president decides he can dispense with Kadyrov
<br>and slowly begins to move against him? Aleksey Malashenko of
<br>Carnegie pointed out to us that the investigation into the
<br>
<br>Moscow 00003579 004 of 005
<br>
<br>
<br>Politkovskaya murder can be used as a "card" to play against
<br>Kadyrov when the time is right -- since Kadyrov's actual
<br>guilt or innocence will have no bearing on whether he is
<br>accused of the murder. To prevent such action, Malashenko
<br>believes, Kadyrov is busy demonstrating how essential he is
<br>to keeping the peace in Chechnya; Malashenko even suggested
<br>to us that there might be collusion between Kadyrov and the
<br>separatist forces of Doku Umarov to keep up a regular stream
<br>of armed incidents and attacks. According to Presidential
<br>Administration staffer Machevskiy, however, continuity will
<br>be provided by Presidential Administration deputy Vladimir
<br>Surkov. Surkov, whose father was a Chechen, has developed
<br>close ties with Kadyrov.
<br>
<br>¶18. (C) A third unknown about the succession is whether
<br>Kadyrov will try to over-reach and renegotiate the current
<br>deal to get even better terms. Kadyrov's rejection of a
<br>treaty officially setting out the power-sharing arrangement
<br>between Moscow and Groznyy was seen as a demonstration of
<br>loyalty, in that any such document would have to retain a
<br>mention of Chechnya's sovereignty. Two other factors may be
<br>at work, however. First, Caucasians prefer to deal orally
<br>rather than set conditions down in black and white, according
<br>to xxxxx, who contrasts this
<br>characteristic with the legalism of the Tatars (whose own
<br>treaty was recently adopted). Second, Kadyrov might see such
<br>a document as limiting, rather than confirming, his rights,
<br>especially when he starts dealing with Putin's successor.
<br>Kadyrov sees Putin as a father, according to all accounts; he
<br>will scarcely view the successor with the same deference.
<br>
<br>Implications For Governance
<br>---------------------------
<br>
<br>¶19. (C) We should not have any delusions that Kadyrov's
<br>political achievements or economic successes or even the
<br>amelioration of Chechnya's human rights situation herald an
<br>era of justice and rule of law. His style of governance
<br>implies regulation of violence, but not reluctance to use it;
<br>organization of corruption, but not its overall reduction;
<br>and recognition of property and other rights of Chechens when
<br>outsiders try to violate them, but not with relation to the
<br>Chechen elite itself. At the same time, we should place this
<br>governance in the context of governance in the Russian
<br>regions: as former Parliament Speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov
<br>told us, "it is only a radical form of what is found in all
<br>the regions," with the exception of the application of
<br>violence -- which Russians and Chechens justify by the
<br>insurgent and Islamist threat, and which is common to all
<br>parts of the North Caucasus. The other characteristics -- of
<br>institutionalized corruption, dubious property rights, and
<br>general impunity of officials -- are present to a greater or
<br>lesser degree in many Russian regions.
<br>
<br>Implications for the U.S.
<br>-------------------------
<br>
<br>¶20. (C) U.S. engagement with Chechnya will be limited not by
<br>Kadyrov but by Moscow, at least until after next year's
<br>presidential transition. We have been told bluntly that
<br>Russia wants to reduce international presence in the North
<br>Caucasus, convinced that "Western" powers will use that
<br>presence to destabilize the transition. Given those
<br>suspicions and parameters, our most thoughtful interlocutors
<br>believe that "limited engagement" is the best policy. A
<br>number of them have cited conferences (in Chechnya) and
<br>exchanges as the best programs to implement that engagement.
<br>
<br>¶21. (C) Even that approach presents difficulties.
<br>Presidential Administration staffer Machevskiy discussed with
<br>us the possibility of holding a model UN at Groznyy
<br>University, with U.S. and other western participants and
<br>advisors. He promised to draft a proposal, but after it went
<br>through his administration's vetting process it came back as
<br>a Model EU, to be held not in Groznyy but in Rostov. There
<br>is clearly no appetite in the Kremlin for ending the
<br>Chechens' isolation.
<br>
<br>¶22. (C) Exchanges remain as the best vehicle for U.S.
<br>interests. Up to now, programs such as the Young Leadership
<br>Program and Open World have been hampered by security
<br>concerns from making the visits necessary to select qualified
<br>candidates from Chechnya. The U.S. should place priority on
<br>making such recruitment possible.
<br>
<br>Coming to Terms with Ground Facts
<br>---------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶23. (C) Beyond the technical aspects of how best to engage,
<br>we need to review the context in which we have placed
<br>Chechnya. Previous conceptions of the Chechen tragedy, still
<br>current in certain think-tank circles, simply do not apply --
<br>
<br>Moscow 00003579 005 of 005
<br>
<br>
<br>the thesis that there is a real government up in the hills,
<br>deriving its legitimacy from the electoral mandate Aslan
<br>Maskhadov won ten years ago, that is still locked in battle
<br>with the Russian invaders and their usurping compradors.
<br>That situation ended years ago, with the execution of the
<br>deal between Putin and Kadyrov senior: the insurgents won,
<br>just a different set of insurgents; those still in the hills
<br>no longer represent any more of a moral authority or
<br>commitment to democracy than does Kadyrov.
<br>
<br>¶24. (C) This is sad for those who were outraged by Russian
<br>atrocities in the first two wars and hopeful for the success
<br>of the Maskhadov government between them. Sad, but true.
<br>Attempts to portray Doku Umarov as a fighter for democracy,
<br>or even a fighter against Russian misrule, simply do not
<br>correspond with reality. This does not mean we can accept
<br>the Russian version that all opponents of Kadyrov are
<br>international terrorists, or that flaws in Umarov's behavior
<br>in any way justify Kadyrov's. But it does mean that we need
<br>to engage with the Chechen government, at an appropriate
<br>non-Kadyrov level, as a prerequisite for engagement with the
<br>Chechen people -- and Chechen welfare, so bound up with the
<br>stability of the North Caucasus, the containment of Islamic
<br>extremism, and the direction that Russia ultimately takes, is
<br>a major U.S. interest.
