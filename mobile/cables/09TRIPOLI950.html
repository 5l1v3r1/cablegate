<br>SUBJECT: LIBYAN HEU SHIPMENT SECURE; NO DECISION YET REGARDING NEXT
<br>STEPS
<br>
<br>REF: A) TRIPOLI 938; B) TRIPOLI 941
<br>
<br>CLASSIFIED BY: Joan A. Polaschik, Charge d'Affaires, U.S.
<br>Embassy Tripoli, Department of State.
<br>REASON: 1.4 (b), (d)
<br>¶1.  (S/NF) Summary:  Visiting DOE experts confirmed December 6
<br>that the Libyan Government had taken the requisite steps to
<br>increase the security of the seven casks of HEU, and that the
<br>contents -- and IAEA seals -- remained unchanged since the
<br>shipment was halted November 25.  The Libyan Government has not
<br>yet provided guidance to its nuclear scientists regarding next
<br>steps on the shipment, but Libyan scientists are developing
<br>contingency plans to remove the HEU from the casks in Libya in
<br>the event the casks must be returned empty to Russia.  DOE
<br>experts estimate that Libyan approval must be received by
<br>December 10 in order for the shipment to be completed by the end
<br>of December.  XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX  We continue to underscore with Libyan officials the
<br>need to resolve this issue.  End summary.
<br>
<br>HEU CASKS SECURE, UNCHANGED
<br>
<br>¶2.  (S/NF) Visiting DOE experts confirmed December 6 that the
<br>Libyan Government had taken the requisite steps to increase
<br>security at the Tajura Nuclear Facility, and that the seven
<br>casks of highly enriched uranium (HEU) appeared to have remained
<br>unchanged since the planned shipment to Russia was halted on
<br>November 25 (ref a).  The DOE experts reported a visible
<br>increase in the number of armed guards surrounding the facility.
<br>They also confirmed that Tajura staff had disengaged the crane
<br>within the facility and had assured the team that a new,
<br>unassembled crane would not be built until after the shipment
<br>had taken place.  DOE's measurements of the spent fuel within
<br>the casks determined that the content had remained unchanged.
<br>Likewise, the IAEA seals on each cask remained in place and
<br>uncompromised.
<br>
<br>NO DECISIONS
<br>
<br>¶3.  (S/NF) The DOE team also reported that Libyan technical
<br>specialists at Tajura had not yet received guidance from the
<br>Libyan Government on next steps regarding the shipment.  XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX  The
<br>team also reported that although the Libyan Government had sent
<br>the Russian Government a diplomatic note confirming that the GOL
<br>would complete its contract to return the casks to Russia by the
<br>end of the calendar year, the note did not specify whether the
<br>casks would be returned empty or with the HEU spent fuel
<br>shipment.  The DOE team assessed the diplomatic note as an
<br>attempt to mollify Russian demands that the casks be returned.
<br>
<br>POSSIBLE NEXT STEPS
<br>
<br>¶4.  (S/NF) The DOE team estimated that the GOL must give its
<br>approval to move forward on the shipment by December 10 in order
<br>for the shipment to take place by the end of December.  The DOE
<br>experts emphasized that significant lead time is required in
<br>order set up the necessary logistical arrangements, permits and
<br>overflight clearances for the specialized Russian plane to
<br>return to Tripoli and transport the HEU to Russia.
<br>
<br>¶5.  (S/NF) The DOE team reported that Russian engineers had
<br>begun to design a remote-controlled grapple to be used in the
<br>event that the HEU spent fuel must be off-loaded from the casks
<br>in Libya. XXXXXXXXXXXXtold the DOE experts that, if GOL
<br>approval for the shipment was not forthcoming by December 10,
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX planned to start training on how to use the
<br>grapple to off-load the casks.  (According to DOE experts, spent
<br>nuclear fuel has never been removed from casks for restorage;
<br>the removal of the spent fuel in Libya would be an unprecedented
<br>initiative.)  DOE experts also commented that the return of the
<br>empty casks to Russia, if necessary, would be best done by boat
<br>and said they are developing contingency plans for that
<br>scenario.
<br>
<br>POSITIVE FEEDBACK FROM THE SECRETARY'S CALL
<br>
<br>¶6.  (S/NF) Separately, emboffs have attempted to seek
<br>clarification of the Libyan Government's next steps regarding
<br>the HEU shipment.  XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX told Pol/Econ Chief that the Secretary's
<br>December 3 call to Libyan Foreign Minister Musa Kusa had
<br>expressed the statement of commitment requested by Saif during
<br>
<br>TRIPOLI 00000950  002 OF 002
<br>
<br>his recent meeting with the Ambassador (ref b), and that Kusa
<br>had passed the message to the "highest levels" of the Libyan
<br>Government. XXXXXXXXXXXX emphasized that Saif had made a "commitment"
<br>to the Ambassador to ensure that the HEU shipment would be
<br>approved by the Libyan Government, and "Saif will follow-through
<br>on that commitment." XXXXXXXXXXXX said Kusa intended to call the
<br>Secretary within the "coming days" in order to personally assure
<br>her that the GOL had approved the shipment.  Emboffs also
<br>briefed Ahmed and MFA officials on the requisite timeline and
<br>lengthy logistical preparations needed to ensure the spent
<br>fuel's transfer to Russia by the end of the year.
<br>
<br>COMMENT
<br>
<br>¶7.  (S/NF) XXXXXXXXXXXX comments indicate that the Secretary's
<br>message to Kusa was positively received.  A flurry of phone
<br>calls between DOE and Libyan experts today also indicated that
<br>working-level Libyan officials are seeking more time to resolve
<br>the issue, as the Libyans successfully convinced the DOE experts
<br>to extend the deadline for a Libyan decision by two days, to
<br>December 10 (the initial deadline proposed by DOE was December
<br>8).  At this point, we are interpreting the Libyan experts'
<br>technical preparations for a possible unloading of the casks in
<br>Libya as the contingency planning required to address the very
<br>real safety and security concerns raised by the halted shipment.
<br>We will reassess that view on December 10, and will continue to
<br>underscore with Libyan officials the need for a resolution of
<br>the issue this week.
