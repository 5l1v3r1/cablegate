<br>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR'S MEETING WITH MICHEL ROCARD 
<br>
<br>REF: PARIS 7195 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Craig R. Stapleton for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d 
<br>). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: Former prime minister Michel Rocard received 
<br>Ambassador Stapleton October 24. Fresh off the early-October 
<br>publication of his new book, "If the Left Had Known," and a 
<br>recent trip to China, Rocard sees the November congress of 
<br>his Socialist Party (PS) as a historic opportunity. Offering 
<br>a historical perspective, Rocard stated that the PS, unlike 
<br>its main counterparts in Europe, has never cut itself off 
<br>completely with the ideology and politics of "rupture with 
<br>capitalism." When in power, dealing with the world as it is, 
<br>the PS has been forced to modernize. This was particularly 
<br>true during the five years (1997-2002) Lionel Jospin led the 
<br>party and government. When out of power, it is pulled back 
<br>by the romanticism of its Marxist roots. Rocard described 
<br>his historic role in the party as that of the leader of the 
<br>modernizers -- in the tradition of Jean Jaures, Leon Blum and 
<br>Pierre Mendes-France. He was hopeful that at the Le Mans 
<br>Congress in November, the Socialists would make the final 
<br>break from the past and emerge as a unified Social Democratic 
<br>Party. Rocard was reluctant to pronounce on the Socialists' 
<br>stable of presidential contenders, but was skeptical that 
<br>Jospin would emerge to rally the party to victory; too many 
<br>can not forgive him for having deserted the ship when he 
<br>abruptly announced his retirement the morning after his 
<br>defeat in the first round of the 2002 Presidential elections. 
<br>Rocard expressed the fear and loathing of Nicolas Sarkozy 
<br>that is common currency on the left. Dominique de Villepin 
<br>is a more acceptable alternative on the right -- even if he 
<br>mistakes himself for Napoleon when he is in fact Cyrano de 
<br>Bergerac. Rocard, who did not support the war in Iraq, said 
<br>that if he had been President, he would have privately 
<br>explained his views to President Bush, but then would have 
<br>remained with the U.S. Rocard, long chastised by some as "the 
<br>American in the party," pronounced anti-Americanism a 
<br>minority sentiment historically linked to the Communists and 
<br>Gaullists. He advocated a joint effort, in the form of a 
<br>European/American think-tank, to identify and address common, 
<br>emerging challenges. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Rocard, like former president Valery Giscard d'Estaing 
<br>(reftel), believes that French history provides the keys for 
<br>understanding French politics and France's policies. 
<br>Rocard's point of departure is France's emergence as a 
<br>nation-state. The history of other European nation-states is 
<br>that of linguistic communities serving their trade needs. 
<br>France created itself by destroying five cultures -- Breton, 
<br>Occitan, Alsatian, Corsican, and Flemish. "We are the only 
<br>European nation which is the military creation of a 
<br>non-homogeneous State. This makes France difficult to govern 
<br>to this day. This explains our difficulty in reforming, our 
<br>slowness," he said. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) The Socialist Party -- and its historic resistance to 
<br>embrace Social Democracy -- is a case in point. Rocard 
<br>contrasted the PS with European counterpart parties, noting 
<br>that in most countries, a Social Democratic party can expect 
<br>about 35 to 42 percent of the national vote. In France, 
<br>however, the PS can only count on about 18 to 22 percent, 
<br>with the Communists taking about 7 to 8 percent, and parties 
<br>of the extreme left a roughly equal number. The need to work 
<br>with the Communists, the far left -- and the unformed wing of 
<br>the PS, makes it difficult to have "feasible, realistic" 
<br>economic policies. Rocard pointed out that in the 25 EU 
<br>member states, only the PS, among the main parties of the 
<br>European left, had split (and a majority of its electorate 
<br>opposed) over the proposed Constitutional Treaty. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Rocard stressed the importance of the upcoming 
<br>November party congress. The French media insist on focusing 
<br>on it only as it pertains to the fortunes of the would-be 
<br>Presidential candidates. While the Congress will have an 
<br>impact on individual candidacies, its significance will 
<br>depend on its success in defining the program, even the 
<br>identity of the party -- amidst debate and soul-searching 
<br>stirred up by the referendum. Rocard listed three important 
<br>questions for the party to resolve: Are we Social Democrats? 
<br>Are we Europeans? Do we admit at last that the market 
<br>economy is not only a reality, but a necessity? While he 
<br>thought it possible (and in his view essential) that the 
<br>Congress will answer each question in the affirmative, this 
<br>is not a foregone conclusion. The party leadership had taken 
<br>the right approach in deciding to address the policy issues 
<br>before proceeding to the selection of a candidate. It has 
<br>created an opportunity for the Socialist Party to finally 
<br>emerge as a modern Social Democratic Party comparable to the 
<br>SPD in Germany or Labor in Britain. Such a "clarifying 
<br>result" would represent the break from the past that Rocard 
<br>has long sought. That said, a more tepid result was possible 
<br>given the strength of the traditionalists, including those 
<br>now centered around Laurent Fabius. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Rocard clearly did not wish to be drawn out on the 
<br>merits or demerits of the possible Socialist candidates for 
<br>the Presidency in 2007. Replying to the Ambassador's 
<br>question on how the PS could transcend its normal 
<br>18-to-22-percent electoral take (in the first round of 
<br>Presidential elections) and furnish a winning presidential 
<br>candidate, Rocard cited the need for a charismatic candidate 
<br>and an attractive platform. This winning combination would 
<br>produce a sufficiently strong showing in the first round so 
<br>as to obviate the need to negotiate with the Communists and 
<br>far left -- thereby increasing its appeal to the moderate 
<br>center in the second round. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Noting a media effort by allies of Lionel Jospin to 
<br>position the former Prime Minister as the only figure who 
<br>could rally the fissiporous left, Rocard was skeptical. 
<br>Rocard, in a fair-minded assessment of Jospin, cited his 
<br>historic contribution of opening up the party in the 
<br>post-Mitterrand period, a modernization that was cut short by 
<br>the defeat in 2002. He cited Jospin's honesty, but saw it as 
<br>a political liability: "Jospin can't bear lying. He is a 
<br>straight and honest man -- to the point of rigidity. He 
<br>refuses to make unfillable promises to the electorate." 
<br>Despite Jospin's virtues, his abrupt departure after his 
<br>defeat in the first round of the 2002 elections was viewed by 
<br>too many in the party and among its supporters as an act of 
<br>desertion in the hour of the party's -- and country's -- 
<br>greatest need. This would likely disqualify him for another 
<br>run at the Presidency. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Rocard was more voluble when discussing the two 
<br>Presidential rivals on the right. He compared Prime Minister 
<br>Villepin favorably to Interior Minister and Union for a 
<br>Popular Movement (UMP) President Nicolas Sarkozy. Even if 
<br>Villepin had gained notice by his 2003 speech before the UN 
<br>Security Council, not a pleasant association for the U.S. it 
<br>is Sarkozy whom we should fear. Villepin "knows the limits 
<br>of power." Sarkozy, by contrast, has traveled little, has 
<br>minimal foreign language ability, and only a meager interest 
<br>in international issues. He employs a language when 
<br>addressing illegal immigrants that Rocard characterized as 
<br>'borderline racist." In short, "Sarkozy is not safe in his 
<br>respect for human rights. He's not Le Pen, but he's a danger 
<br>to the balance of the French Republic in its practice of 
<br>human rights." By contrast, Villepin shares our common 
<br>values concerning human right. In addition, "he is someone 
<br>who would never mistake those who are allies with those who 
<br>are not" (sic). 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Rocard, however, also expressed his "anger" at 
<br>Villepin for the 2003 UNSC speech, which he thought had been 
<br>counter-productive, particularly with respect to 
<br>then-Secretary Powell. "We should have been supporting 
<br>Powell; instead, Villepin pushed him into a corner." Rocard 
<br>said that if he had been President of France at the time, he 
<br>would have written a four or five page letter to President 
<br>Bush at the outset, setting forth his misgivings over a 
<br>military solution. The letter would have remained 
<br>confidential. Once the U.S. decided to proceed against Iraq, 
<br>
<br>SIPDIS 
<br>however, he would have remained silent, and not led 
<br>international opposition as Chirac and Villepin had done. 
<br>Rocard joked that Villepin identifies with Napoleon, whereas 
<br>he is in fact more a Cyrano de Bergerac character. He is the 
<br>inheritor of a proud French oral tradition: "We like to 
<br>talk; if you want a silent partner, you should be dealing 
<br>with the Finns instead." 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Rocard emphasized to the Ambassador the importance of 
<br>not conflating the loud French anti-Americanism espoused by 
<br>the Communists and Gaullists with the pro-American sentiment 
<br>felt by most French people. "Please don't forget," he said, 
<br>"that anti-Americanism has never won a majority here." He 
<br>criticized the U.S., however, for not having listened to 
<br>"friendly" advice in the lead-up to the Iraq war. The 
<br>French, who lost two colonial wars, in Indochina and Algeria, 
<br>he said, tried to warn the U.S. that it would be unavoidable 
<br>-- "sociologically predictable" -- that the Iraqi factions 
<br>would unite against the USG. He emphasized, however, the 
<br>necessity for the U.S. to stay the course, warning that Iraq 
<br>would descend into civil war if the U.S. left before 
<br>2010-2012. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) In response to the Ambassador's question on the 
<br>consequences for Europe of the failure of the constitutional 
<br>treaty, Rocard said he thought it "less important than many 
<br>believe, and not too important to the U.S." There is indeed 
<br>a resultant paralysis, but not of the functioning of the EU. 
<br>Rather, it has incapacitated the creative energy and 
<br>enthusiasm for the European project. "It kills the idea of a 
<br>political Europe which you (the U.S.) were afraid of, and 
<br>does not change a thing in the integrated market." He 
<br>provided his assessment that the current Administration's 
<br>support for Europe had been hesitant, and for two reasons: 
<br>concern over the possible emergence of Europe as a military 
<br>power separate from NATO/US; and, increasing conflict over 
<br>economic and commercial issues, which was an unavoidable 
<br>result of Europe's development as strong, unitary player in 
<br>the international economy. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Rocard proposed a joint European/American think-tank, 
<br>which might fill a current gap -- a place where Europeans and 
<br>Americans can together consider the challenges of tomorrow. 
<br>Speaking of the growth of India and China, along with all the 
<br>other challenges confronting both of us, he said, "We need a 
<br>vehicle where we can find solutions for these challenges 
<br>together -- so when these monsters arrive in 10 years, we 
<br>will be able to deal with them."
