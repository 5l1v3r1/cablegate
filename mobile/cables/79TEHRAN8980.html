<br>E.O. 12065: GDS 8/12/85 (TOMSETH, VICTOR L.) OR-P 
<br>TAGS: PEPR IR
<br>SUBJECT: NEGOTIATIONS 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C - ENTIRE TEXT). 
<br> 
<br>¶2. INTRODUCTION: RECENT NEGOTIATIONS IN WHICH THE 
<br>EMBASSY HAS BEEN INVOLVED HERE, RANGING FROM COMPOUND 
<br>SECURITY TO VISA OPERATIONS TO GTE TO THE SHERRY CASE, 
<br>HIGHLIGHT SEVERAL SPECIAL FEATURES OF CONDUCTING 
<br>BUSINESS IN THE PERSIAN ENVIRONMENT. IN SOME INSTANCES 
<br>THE DIFFICULTIES WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED ARE A PARTIAL 
<br>REFLECTION ON THE EFFECTS OF THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION, 
<br>BUT WE BELIEVE THE UNDERLYING CULTURAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL 
<br>QUALITIES THAT ACCOUNT FOR THE NATURE OF THESE DIFFICULTIES 
<br>ARE AND WILL REMAIN RELATIVELY CONSTANT. THEREFORE, 
<br>WE SUGGEST THAT THE FOLLOWING ANALYSIS BE USED TO BRIEF 
<br>BOTH USG PERSONNEL AND PRIVATE SECTOR REPRESENTATIVES 
<br>WHO ARE REQUIRED TO DO BUSINESS WITH AND IN THIS 
<br>COUNTRY. END INTRODUCTION. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. PERHAPS THE SINGLE DOMINANT ASPECT OF THE PERSIAN 
<br>PSYCHE IS AN OVERRIDING EGOISM. ITS ANTECEDENTS LIE 
<br>IN THE LONG IRANIAN HISTORY OF INSTABILITY AND INSECURITY 
<br>WHICH PUT A PREMIUM ON SELF-PRESERVATION. THE PRACTICAL 
<br>EFFECT OF IT IS AN ALMOST TOTAL PERSIAN PREOCCUPATION 
<br>WITH SELF AND LEAVES LITTLE ROOM FOR UNDERSTANDING POINTS 
<br>OF VIEW OTHER THAN ONE'S OWN. THUS, FOR EXAMPLE, IT 
<br>IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO AN IRANIAN THAT U.S. IMMIGRATION 
<br>LAW MAY PROHIBIT ISSUING HIM A TOURIST VISA WHEN HE HAS 
<br>DETERMINED THAT HE WANTS TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. 
<br>SIMILARLY, THE IRANIAN CENTRAL BANK SEES NO INCONSISTENCY 
<br>IN CLAIMING FORCE MAJEURE TO AVOID PENALTIES FOR LATE 
<br>PAYMENT OF INTEREST DUE ON OUTSTANDING LOANS WHILE THE 
<br>GOVERNMENT OF WHICH IT IS A PART IS DENYING THE VAILIDITY 
<br>OF THE VERY GROUNDS UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS MADE WHEN 
<br>CONFRONTED BY SIMILAR CLAIMS FROM FOREIGN FIRMS FORCED 
<br>TO CEASE OPERATIONS DURING THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. THE REVERSE OF THIS PARTICULAR PSYCHOLOGICAL COIN, 
<br>AND HAVING THE SAME HISTORICAL ROOTS AS PERSIAN EGOISM, 
<br>IS A PERVASIVE UNEASE ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE WORLD IN 
<br>WHICH ONE LIVES. THE PERSIAN EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT 
<br>NOTHING IS PERMANENT AND IT IS COMMONLY PERCEIVED THAT 
<br>HOSTILE FORCES ABOUND. IN SUCH AN ENVIRONMENT EACH 
<br>INDIVIDUAL MUST BE CONSTANTLY ALERT FOR OPPORTUNITIES 
<br>TO PROTECT HIMSELF AGAINST THE MALEVOLENT FORCES THAT 
<br>WOULD OTHERWISE BE HIS UNDOING. HE IS OBVIOUSLY 
<br>JUSTIFIED IN USING ALMOST ANY MEANS AVAILABLE TO EXPLOIT 
<br>SUCH OPPORTUNITIES. THIS APPROACH UNDERLIES THE SOCALLED 
<br>"BAZAAR MENTALITY" SO COMMON AMONG PERSIANS, A 
<br>MIND-SET THAT OFTEN IGNORES LONGER TERM INTERESTS IN 
<br>FAVOR OF IMMEDIATELY OBTAINABLE ADVANTAGES AND COUNTENANCES 
<br>PRACTICES THAT ARE REGARDED AS UNETHICAL BY OTHER 
<br>NORMS. AN EXAMPLE IS THE SEEMINGLY SHORTSIGHTED AND 
<br>HARASSING TACTICS EMPLOYED BY THE PGOI IN ITS NEGOTIATIONS 
<br>WITH GTE. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. COUPLED WITH THESE PSYCHOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS IS A 
<br>GENERAL INCOMPREHENSION OF CASUALITY. ISLAM, WITH ITS 
<br>EMPHASIS ON THE OMNIPOTENCE OF GOD, APPEARS TO ACCOUNT 
<br>AT LEAST IN MAJOR PART FOR THIS PHENOMENON. SOMEWHAT 
<br>SURPRISINGLY, EVEN THOSE IRANIANS EDUCATED IN THE 
<br>WESTERN STYLE AND PERHAPS WITH LONG EXPERIENCE OUTSIDE 
<br>IRAN ITSELF FREQUENTLY HAVE DIFFICULTY GRASPING THE 
<br>INTER-RELATIONSHIP OF EVENTS. WITNESS A YAZDI RESISTING 
<br>THE IDEA THAT IRANIAN BEHAVIOR HAS CONSEQUENCES ON THE 
<br>PERCEPTION OF IRAN IN THE U.S. OR THAT THIS PERCEPTION 
<br>IS SOMEHOW RELATED TO AMERICAN POLICIES REGARDING 
<br>IRAN. THIS SAME QUALITY ALSO HELPS EXPLAIN PERSIAN 
<br>AVERSION TO ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY FOR ONE'S OWN 
<br>ACTIONS. THE DEUS EX MACHINA IS ALWAYS AT WORK. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. THE PERSIAN PROCLIVITY FOR ASSUMING THAT TO SAY 
<br>SOMETHING IS TO DO IT FURTHER COMPLICATES MATTERS. 
<br>AGAIN, YAZDI CAN EXPRESS SURPRISE WHEN INFORMED THAT THE 
<br>IRREGULAR SECURITY FORCES ASSIGNED TO THE EMBASSY REMAIN 
<br>IN PLACE. "BUT THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE TOLD ME THEY 
<br>WOULD GO BY MONDAY," HE SAYS. AN MFA OFFICIAL REPORTS 
<br>THAT THE SHERRY CASE IS "90 PERCENT SOLVED," BUT WHEN 
<br>A CONSULAR OFFICER INVESTIGATES HE DISCOVERS THAT NOTHING 
<br>HAS CHANGED. THERE IS NO RECOGNITION THAT INSTRUCTIONS 
<br>MUST BE FOLLOWED UP, THAT COMMITMENTS MUST BE ACCOMPANIED 
<br>BY ACTION AND RESULTS. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. FINALLY, THERE ARE THE PERSIAN CONCEPTS OF INFLUENCE 
<br>AND OBLIGATION. EVERYONE PAYS OBEISANCE TO THE FORMER 
<br>AND THE LATTER IS USUALLY HONORED IN THE BREACH. 
<br>PERSIANS ARE CONSUMED WITH DEVELOPING PARTI BAZI--THE 
<br>INFLUENCE THAT WILL HELP GET THINGS DONE--WHILE FAVORS 
<br>ARE ONLY GRUDGINGLY BESTOWED AND THEN JUST TO THE 
<br>EXTENT THAT A TANGIBLE QUID PRO QUO IS IMMEDIATELY 
<br>PRECEPTIBLE. FORGET ABOUT ASSISTANCE PROFERRED LAST 
<br>YEAR OR EVEN LAST WEEK; WHAT CAN BE OFFERED TODAY? 
<br> 
<br>¶7. THERE ARE SEVERAL LESSONS FOR THOSE WHO WOULD NEGOTIATE 
<br>WITH PERSIANS IN ALL THIS: 
<br> 
<br>- --FIRST, ONE SHOULD NEVER ASSUME THAT HIS SIDE OF 
<br>THE ISSUE WILL BE RECOGNIZED, LET ALONE THAT IT WILL 
<br>BE CONCEDED TO HAVE MERITS. PERSIAN PREOCCUPATION WITH 
<br>SELF PRECLUDES THIS. A NEGOTIATOR MUST FORCE RECOGNITION 
<br>OF HIS POSITION UPON HIS PERSIAN OPPOSITE NUMBER. 
<br> 
<br>- --SECOND, ONE SHOULD NOT EXPECT AN IRANIAN READILY 
<br>TO PERCEIVE THE ADVANTAGES OF A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP 
<br>BASED ON TRUST. HE WILL ASSUME THAT HIS OPPOSITE 
<br>NUMBER IS ESSENTIALLY AN ADVERSARY. IN DEALING WITH 
<br>HIM HE WILL ATTEMPT TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS TO HIMSELF 
<br>THAT ARE IMMEDIATELY OBTAINABLE. HE WILL BE PREPARED 
<br>TO GO TO GREAT LENGTHS TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, INCLUDING 
<br>RUNNING THE RISK OF SO ALIENATING WHOEVER HE IS DEALING 
<br>WITH THAT FUTURE BUSINESS WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE, AT 
<br>LEAST TO THE LATTER. 
<br> 
<br>- --THIRD, INTERLOCKING RELATIONSHIPS OF ALL ASPECTS 
<br>OF AN ISSUE MUST BE PAINSTAKINGLY, FORECEFULLY AND 
<br>REPEATEDLY DEVELOPED. LINKAGES WILL BE NEITHER READILY 
<br>COMPREHENDED NOR ACCEPTED BY PERSIAN NEGOTIATORS. 
<br> 
<br>- --FOURTH, ONE SHOULD INSIST ON PERFORMANCE AS THE 
<br>SINE QUA NON AT ESH STAGE OF NEGOTIATIONS. STATEMENTS 
<br>OF INTENTION COUNT FOR ALMOST NOTHING. 
<br> 
<br>- --FIFTH, CULTIVATION OF GOODWILL FOR GOODWILL'S SAKE 
<br>IS A WASTE OF EFFORT. THE OVERRIDING OBJECTIVE AT ALL 
<br>TIMES SHOULD BE IMPRESSING UPON THE PERSIAN ACROSS THE 
<br>TABLE THE MUTUALITY OF THE PROPOSED UNDERTAKINGS, HE 
<br>MUST BE MADE TO KNOW THAT A QUID PRO QUO IS INVOLVED 
<br>ON BOTH SIDES. 
<br> 
<br>- --FINALLY, ONE SHOULD BE PREPARED FOR THE THREAT 
<br>OF BREAKDOWN IN NEGOTIATIONS AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT AND NOT 
<br>BE COWED BY THE POSSIBLITY. GIVEN THE PERSIAN 
<br>NEGOTIATOR'S CULTURAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS, HE 
<br>IS GOING TO RESIST THE VERY CONCEPT OF A RATIONAL 
<br>(FROM THE WESTERN POINT OF VIEW) NEGOTIATING PROCESS.
