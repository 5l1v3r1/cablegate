<br>Summary
<br>
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Pope Benedict XVI promoted traditional Catholic
<br>doctrine on the family and bioethics during his recent visit to
<br>Spain, but opted for respectful dialogue over open attacks
<br>against the Spanish government's policies on gay marriage,
<br>divorce and abortion. The pope aimed to pitch his message to
<br>the entire Western world and not just the Spanish.
<br>Vatican-based media and others commented on Spanish PM
<br>Zapatero's "snub" of a papal mass, but the Holy See took no
<br>offense at his absence. Holy See officials told us that from
<br>their perspective the visit was a success, even if challenges
<br>remain in Vatican - Spain relations. End Summary.

<br>Calls to Strengthen Family and Morals
<br>
<br>-------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) Pope Benedict XVI traveled to Spain in early July
<br>for the Vatican's World Meeting of Families, setting the stage
<br>for potential conflict between the Holy See and a Spanish
<br>government that has irritated the Vatican with its positions on
<br>some "life and family issues" (reftel). In the event, Benedict
<br>did not shy away from comments on same-sex marriage, abortion,
<br>and genetic research, but the comments were not so much
<br>finger-wagging at the Spanish government, as a message aimed at
<br>the Western world in general. Benedict has prioritized a battle
<br>against what he sees as the Western world's embrace of
<br>relativism and radical secularism, charging that the West has
<br>forgotten the social adhesion provided by traditional
<br>Christian/moral values.

<br>New Compendium
<br>
<br>--------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) The pope's visit coincided with the release of a new
<br>compendium of Catholic doctrine on the family. Issued by the
<br>Pontifical Council for the Family (this year celebrating its
<br>25th anniversary), the document encourages traditional family
<br>life centered on a married heterosexual couple and their
<br>children, and condemns same-sex marriage, divorce, abortion and
<br>artificial contraception.
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) More aggressive proponents of the lines reinforced by
<br>the document include Council for the Family President Cardinal
<br>Alfonso Lopez Trujillo, who recently sounded off against
<br>embryonic stem-cell research, threatening excommunication for
<br>the researchers, health professionals and women involved.
<br>American Cardinal William Levada, Prefect of the Vatican's
<br>theological body, has urged lawmakers to stand firm on issues
<br>such as same-sex marriage and the liberalization of legislation
<br>on abortion and divorce.

<br>Pope Tries to Persuade - Not Confront
<br>
<br>-------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) In this context, the pope's tack in Spain was milder
<br>than some expected. While making his points on the relevant
<br>"family" issues clear, Benedict himself was keen to accent the
<br>positive during the conference. When asked by reporters about
<br>the legalization of gay marriage in Spain, the pontiff said he
<br>preferred to encourage heterosexual families, while at the same
<br>time offering help and respect to homosexuals. Monsignor Paolo
<br>Gualtieri (protect throughout), Vatican MFA Country Director for
<br>Spain, told us Benedict wanted to avoid direct criticism of the
<br>Spanish government. In addition, he addressed, but did not
<br>emphasize the hot-button family issues in his private meeting
<br>with Spanish PM Zapatero. The pope asked for greater
<br>cooperation on those issues (and the teaching of religion in
<br>schools), Gualtieri said, but put more emphasis on issues such
<br>as immigration, international conflicts and Africa.

<br>
<br>Is Spain Worth a Mass?
<br>
<br>----------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Vatican-based media and others reported "controversy"
<br>over PM Zapatero's decision not to attend the conference's
<br>concluding mass celebrated by the pope. Gualtieri told us that
<br>the pope was not miffed by Zapatero's absence. If anything,
<br>Gualtieri said, Zapatero stayed home to "save the Holy Father
<br>potential embarrassment" due to protests or other controversy
<br>that may well have occurred had he attended the mass. The
<br>conference as a whole had the fingerprints of conservative
<br>Catholic group Opus Dei and several right-leaning Spanish
<br>politicians - few of whom, our contacts emphasized to us, could
<br>be counted among Zapatero's greatest admirers.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Media contacts told us privately that outgoing Vatican
<br>press office chief Joaquin Navarro-Valls (septel) purposely
<br>played up the "snub" angle. Vatican officials confirmed that
<br>Navarro-Valls was on his own on this one, and hinted that as a
<br>Spaniard and Opus Dei member himself, he had become too
<br>personally involved in the story. Gualtieri noted that the
<br>government was in fact represented by two cabinet ministers.
<br>"There really was no problem [regarding the mass]," he concluded.

<br>Comment
<br>
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU) Continuing to surprise those who expected him to be a
<br>heavy-handed enforcer in the papacy, Benedict has used tact and
<br>persuasion rather than fire and brimstone in his battle against
<br>relativism and secularism. This may not be a fight that the
<br>pope can win in Spain or the rest of Western Europe, but his
<br>current approach may have greater long-term impact than the
<br>alternative.
