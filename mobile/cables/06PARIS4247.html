<br>
<br>SUMMARY 
<br>------- 
<br>¶1. (C) Socialist Party (PS) First Secretary Francois 
<br>Hollande and PS National Secretary for International Affairs 
<br>Pierre Moscovici briefed the Ambassador June 8 on the 
<br>turbulent race for the presidential nomination within the PS 
<br>and the hurdles facing the party as it looks to next year's 
<br>presidential and legislative elections. Hollande underlined 
<br>that, notwithstanding Poitou-Charentes Region President 
<br>Segolene Royal's commanding lead today in polls, both among 
<br>the public at large and among PS members, PS members' 
<br>convictions as to which PS leader "is best placed to beat 
<br>Sarkozy" could well change between now and the PS's 
<br>presidential primary in November. Hollande nonetheless 
<br>believed the primary would produce a clear cut result, 
<br>"probably in just one round." Asked what might be expected 
<br>from French foreign policy under a socialist government, 
<br>Hollande used the phrase "neither Blair and Chirac" to 
<br>characterize an overall stance towards the U.S. that would 
<br>not be uncritically supportive, but also not be gratuitously 
<br>obstructionist. On Europe, Moscovici stressed that a 
<br>Socialist president and government would be much more 
<br>pro-Europe than President Chirac and the government of Prime 
<br>Minister Dominique de Villepin. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>ATMOSPHERICS 
<br>------------- 
<br>¶2. (C) Over breakfast with the Ambassador at the residence 
<br>on June 8, Socialist Party (PS) First Secretary Francois 
<br>Hollande and PS National Secretary for International Affairs 
<br>Pierre Moscovici were confident, optimistic and dismissive of 
<br>the drumbeat of media reports that insist that frictions and 
<br>divisions within the PS will make it difficult for the party 
<br>to close ranks behind a single candidate for the 2007 
<br>presidential race even after the party primary next November. 
<br>
<br>UPCOMING ELECTIONS WILL BE HARD FOUGHT 
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br>¶3. (C) Hollande and Moscovici predicted that the 2007 
<br>presidential and legislative elections would be particularly 
<br>hard fought because neither of the two major parties "can 
<br>count on more than 30 percent of the electorate." (Note: The 
<br>center-left PS and the center-right Union for a Popular 
<br>Movement (UMP) are the preponderant parties in a political 
<br>spectrum that includes the small, centrist Union for French 
<br>Democracy (UDF) party along with a range of micro parties. 
<br>Indeed, if the pattern of past presidential elections holds 
<br>in 2007, there will be over a dozen candidates competing in 
<br>the first round of the election. End note.) Hollande 
<br>suggested that, since neither of the major parties can aspire 
<br>to majority status, the UDF might well find itself with 
<br>leverage beyond its size, particularly if in the legislative 
<br>elections that follow the presidential election, neither the 
<br>PS nor the UMP win a near majority of seats. Hollande added 
<br>that, in both the presidential and legislative elections, the 
<br>Communist Party (PC) and other far-left parties "would vote 
<br>against the right," but not join in any socialist government 
<br>in the event of a PS-led legislature. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Hollande expressed his firm conviction that the PS 
<br>was well-positioned to win both the presidential and 
<br>legislative contests, but that both elections will be 
<br>extremely close. Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy, barring 
<br>an unexpected reverse, would be the center-right's candidate, 
<br>and -- according to Hollande -- will benefit from the active 
<br>support of President Chirac, "if Sarkozy is nice to him." 
<br>That is, according to Hollande, if Sarkozy agrees to look 
<br>after Chirac loyalists and, by implication, Chirac himself. 
<br>(Note: Chirac will lose his immunity from prosecution upon 
<br>leaving office; corruption charges for political financing 
<br>activities dating from before he became president remain 
<br>pending against him. End note.) Hollande said that he did 
<br>not believe that Chirac would prefer to see the PS candidate 
<br>take the presidency rather than see Sarkozy become his 
<br>successor. Even so, Hollande also spoke of the bitterly 
<br>personal, "fratricidal" rivalries on the center-right, 
<br>comparing them to the less personal, more ideological 
<br>rivalries in his center-left, PS. 
<br>
<br>THE CHALLENGE OF REFORM WITHOUT A MANDATE 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br>¶5. (C) Hollande said that whoever wins the presidency in 
<br>2007, the electoral system and divisions in the electorate 
<br>are such that the victor will not have a "mandate for 
<br>reform," and certainly not a mandate in the majority 
<br>rule/winner-takes-all "American" sense of the term. This 
<br>meant that reforms would come slowly, if at all. However, 
<br>Hollande also ruled out the possibility of a president from 
<br>one party and a parliamentary majority from another, saying 
<br>that he believed the back-to-back presidential and 
<br>legislative elections would both reflect the voters' decision 
<br>for change. This would help, Hollande said, to bring about 
<br>some significant reforms, albeit slowly. 
<br>
<br>UPBEAT ABOUT THE STATE OF THE PS 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>¶6. (C) Hollande was bullish and buoyant about the state of 
<br>the PS. He pointed to the party's recent consensus on its 
<br>"project for 2007" -- a platform statement that all the 
<br>party's presidential hopefuls agreed to with little argument 
<br>-- as evidence of the party's stability and unity, even as he 
<br>allowed that it would not be binding on the various 
<br>candidates. Hollande and Moscovici agreed that recent 
<br>meetings to hammer out the platform were, by PS standards, 
<br>rather non-eventful, and the press coverage of rejection of 
<br>proposals by Royal and others "highly exaggerated." 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Hollande proudly underlined the policy statement's 
<br>call for enhanced social programs, while admitting, when 
<br>pressed, that implementing everything it calls for might 
<br>prove a little "expensive." (Comment: Indeed, differences 
<br>over the likely cost of the PS's electoral program (Hollande 
<br>cites the figure of 30 billion Euros, whereas Strauss-Kahn 
<br>has said the price tag is closer to 50 billion) are sure to 
<br>fuel controversy over the proposal and PS candidate's 
<br>commitment to implementing it if elected. End Comment.) 
<br>Hollande added that the electoral program's "social 
<br>dimension" could help the PS attract center-right "Gaullist 
<br>voters" disaffected with the UMP's free-market liberalism. 
<br>
<br>PREDICTS A ONE-ROUND PRIMARY 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>¶8. (C) Hollande confidently predicted that the PS would 
<br>unify behind whoever wins the primary in the interest of 
<br>victory -- though he conceded that primaries can sometimes 
<br>weaken rather than strengthen a candidate. He defended the 
<br>November date for party's choosing of a candidate, saying 
<br>that, had the candidate been chosen now, he/she would have 
<br>been subjected to a potentially crippling drumbeat of 
<br>criticism from the right. Hollande also confidently 
<br>predicted that the PS's November primary would produce a 
<br>clear cut winner, "probably in just one round." Hollande 
<br>said that, above all, party members "want a winner" and will 
<br>therefore support the candidate most likely to beat Sarkozy 
<br>in a putative, second round run-off. 
<br>
<br>ROYAL 
<br>----- 
<br>¶9. (C) Hollande strongly implied that that candidate could 
<br>easily be Royal, saying that if the primary were held today, 
<br>"she will win and be the candidate," barring a sharp downturn 
<br>in her popularity in the pitiless triage of an intensifying 
<br>presidential campaign. 
<br>Hollande noted that Royal is not part of the traditional 
<br>party establishment, and commented that the attacks against 
<br>her have only served to make her all the more popular. 
<br>Referring to her opponents among the socialists, Hollande 
<br>said that those who resented her sudden success, and took 
<br>cheap shots at her, were as a practical matter, "acting as 
<br>her allies." Hollande wondered out loud if her popularity 
<br>would last, accurately identifying that as the key question 
<br>about her candidacy. Several times he mentioned the 
<br>unpredictability of politics, making clear that he believed 
<br>much could happen between now and next May's first round of 
<br>the presidential election that could turn upside down "the 
<br>givens of today." In particular, Hollande evoked how a major 
<br>international crisis -- he gave Iran as an example -- might 
<br>completely change the dynamics of the upcoming elections. 
<br>
<br>CAREFUL NOT TO RULE OUT HIS OWN CANDIDACY 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br>¶10. (C) Hollande was careful to make clear that he too was 
<br>prepared to run as a unifying candidate, but only if it 
<br>seemed to him he would be likely to win the party primary -- 
<br>hands down in the first round. He was categorical in ruling 
<br>out that that he would not/not run "out of pride" or "to get 
<br>10 percent of the vote." (Comment: Clearly, the only 
<br>circumstances under which Hollande would be likely to win big 
<br>in the primary, is if Royal for some reason drops out. End 
<br>Comment.) 
<br>
<br>FABIUS 
<br>------ 
<br>¶11. (C) Hollande contrasted his "team player" attitude with 
<br>what he dismissively called former prime minister Laurent 
<br>Fabius' "accountant" mentality, saying, "just because 20 
<br>percent of the party supports him, he thinks that entitles 
<br>him to 20 percent of whatever the party does." Almost as an 
<br>afterthought, Hollande added "no matter what, Fabius will 
<br>run." 
<br>
<br>
<br>EUROPE 
<br>------ 
<br>¶12. (C) Moscovici said that a PS administration would be much 
<br>more pro-Europe than President Chirac and Prime Minister de 
<br>Villepin (see also reftel). Both Hollande and Moscovici saw 
<br>a need to use Europe to consolidate defense industries and 
<br>reduce defense expenditures through economies of scale. 
<br>Hollande noted sardonically that France was unable to sell 
<br>its fighters and tanks to anyone. Moscovici saw a need for 
<br>an increased parliamentary role in policy-making related to 
<br>Europe, complaining that there was currently too much power 
<br>concentrated in the presidency. Hollande described the 
<br>absurd situation where the prime minister, who does not 
<br>participate in European Council meetings, represents the 
<br>government during the question-and-answer sessions in the 
<br>National Assembly to defend policies set by the President. 
<br>Hollande did not disagree with timeline set by Chirac and 
<br>German Chancellor Merkel for getting Europe back on its feet 
<br>in 2007-2008, noting the importance of the Franco-German 
<br>tandem and saying that, if the effort failed, it would take 
<br>another 4-5 years to come up with something new. 
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Both Hollande and Moscovici made clear they that they 
<br>believed Chirac had no credibility for proposing anything now 
<br>to advance the European project, and both dismissed the idea 
<br>that the rejected constitution could be subjected to a second 
<br>referendum or, worse in their view, passed through 
<br>parliament. Holland and Moscovici agreed something new would 
<br>be required "to get Europe moving again," but they had 
<br>nothing specific to suggest. In the interim, Moscovici 
<br>suggested, it might be possible to use Croatian accession to 
<br>introduce a few institutional reforms that could be approved 
<br>by the parliaments of member states. Hollande dismissed 
<br>Sarkozy's ideas for having the six largest EU members states 
<br>play a leading role in setting policy, saying they were based 
<br>on outmoded ideas of "great powers" setting policy for 
<br>"little powers.". 
<br>
<br>FRANCE ) U.S. RELATIONS 
<br>----------------------- 
<br>¶14. (C) Hollande gave a slightly different version of the 
<br>argument we usually hear that, while the French at a large 
<br>disagree with the U.S. intervention in Iraq, Chirac and 
<br>Villepin should nonetheless not have confronted the U.S. so 
<br>openly. Hollande argued that Chirac erred by not making it 
<br>clear from the beginning how far he was prepared to go to 
<br>oppose the U.S. If Chirac had communicated more clearly how 
<br>strongly he felt about the matter, it would not have led to 
<br>the false impression that France might come along in the end. 
<br>Moscovici repeated his calls for dialogue aimed at 
<br>attempting to find agreement when the U.S. and France should 
<br>differ, adding that differences should be the exception and 
<br>not the rule. Hollande said he wanted a French foreign 
<br>policy more firmly rooted in universal values, such as 
<br>support for democracy, rather than the highly personalized 
<br>approach which characterized the Chirac years. 
<br>
<br>COMMENT 
<br>------- 
<br>¶15. (C) The are those among the PS's heavyweights, -- 
<br>Strauss-Kahn, Fabius and their supporters -- who believe that 
<br>Hollande is subtly, successfully shaping developments so that 
<br>the PS candidate will wind up being either Royal or himself. 
<br>Commentators and party insiders refer to this pair of 
<br>possible outcomes as the "popularity" and "institutional" 
<br>options. In the case of the first, Royal successfully uses 
<br>her popularity with the public to impose herself on the party 
<br>as its candidate. If, however, Royal and her popularity 
<br>should for some reason falter, revealing a deeply splintered 
<br>party with no attractive candidates (the situation before her 
<br>emergence as the clear front-runner), then the 
<br>"institutional" option -- turning to the party leader to lead 
<br>the party in the election -- could become a viable one.
