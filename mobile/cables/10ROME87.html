<br> SUMMARY 
<br>  ------- 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (C)  Staff Director of the House Foreign Affairs 
<br>Committee (HCFA) Dr. Richard Kessler and HCFA staff members 
<br>probed senior MFA and energy and gas parastatal Eni officials 
<br>on Italy's intentions concerning Iran sanctions and prospects 
<br>for effective multilateral action to curb Iran's nuclear 
<br>program.  Opposition Democratic Party (PD) officials 
<br>discussed Iran, Italy's role in Afghanistan, the MEPP, Iraq, 
<br>and nonproliferation with the Staffdel.  End Summary. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>IRAN DOMINATES MFA TALKS 
<br>------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (C)  A January 8 roundtable discussion with Dr. Kessler 
<br>and three HCFA staff members at the Ministry of Foreign 
<br>Affairs (MFA) included MFA Director General for Multilateral 
<br>Political Cooperation Stefano Ronca, Ronca's Deputy Filippo 
<br>Formica, and  Deputy DG for Economic Cooperation Claudio 
<br>Spinedi.  Office Directors Massimo Marotti 
<br>(Political-Military Security and NATO Affairs); Diego 
<br>Brasioli (G8 Issues and Global Challenges); and Giovanni 
<br>Pugliese (Arms Control and Nonproliferation) also 
<br>participated. After the roundtable the Staffdel had a meeting 
<br>with MFA Deputy SecGen and Political Director Sandro De 
<br>Bernardin.  Post was represented by the Charge, Pol-Mil 
<br>Counselor and Poloff (notetaker). 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C)  Ronca believes the deteriorating situation in Iran 
<br>will soon come to a head and that the UNSC should convey to 
<br>Iran that delay tactics will not work and support this 
<br>position by readiness to adopt further pressure.  Ronca and 
<br>Spinedi told the Staffdel Italy is ready to explore, with its 
<br>EU colleagues, the possibility of further sanctions, which, 
<br>however, must conform to EU regulations, and not affect the 
<br>legal rights of European companies.  Ronca suggested that the 
<br>Iranian financial, oil and gas, and insurance sectors (but 
<br>not the Central Bank) could be targeted and that the list 
<br>sensitive products on the export ban list could be expanded. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (C)  Spinedi, who (with Formica) attended the October 7 
<br>Washington meeting of "Likeminded States on Iran," started by 
<br>briefly alluding to Italy's longstanding complaint of 
<br>exclusion from P5 1.  Spinedi pointed out we needed to 
<br>determine what kind of sanctions would be acceptable to China 
<br>and Russia, adding that even at the beginning of January, 
<br>China's UN ambassador said that China "needed more time," 
<br>which, Spinedi noted, was not a total rejection of tougher 
<br>sanctions.  Spinedi advocated strengthening what already 
<br>exists and deciding where we are willing to exert additional 
<br>pressure (especially in the oil and gas sector).  It would be 
<br>important to determine which technologies others (e.g., China 
<br>and India) are willing to provide and embargo those which 
<br>they cannot.  Spinedi acknowledged that Italy had not yet 
<br>imposed legally binding sanctions, but that the GOI had 
<br>successfully used "moral suasion." 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (C)  Spinedi noted that sanctions proposed by the U.S. at 
<br>the October 7 Likeminded meeting included targeting the 
<br>Iranian Revolutionary Guard Command (IRGC), but did not 
<br>include an embargo of refined oil and gas products.  Spinedi 
<br>echoed Ronca in saying that in the coming months Italy will 
<br>need to see how the rest of the Europe will approach new 
<br>sanctions. 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (C)  MFA Deputy SecGen Sandro De Bernardin told the 
<br>Staffdel that Italy was well aware of the danger posed by 
<br>Iran and supported a "firm line."  De Bernardin noted Eni's 
<br>considerable investments in Iran and characterized Italy's 
<br>"moral suasion" efforts to wean Iran away from its nuclear 
<br>ambitions as a "significant success."  On sanctions, De 
<br>Bernardin stated that Italy was prepared to assume its "share 
<br>of responsibility," but that sanctions are a means of 
<br>pressure, not a goal; effective ones must be found. In De 
<br>Bernardin's view, U.S.domestic legislation should not 
<br>negatively affect other countries and the presidential waiver 
<br>has been useful in the past; he hoped it will still figure in 
<br>the future. 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (C)  Kessler encouraged Italy to continue and reinforce 
<br> 
<br>ROME 00000087  002.2 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>their past efforts.  De Bernardin agreed that if Iran gets 
<br>the bomb, then others will seek to acquire nuclear weapons 
<br>too and that the Iranian regime must realize there is a heavy 
<br>price to be paid for persisting in non-compliance. "  De 
<br>Bernardin reiterated Italy's support for openess to dialogue 
<br>in addition to pressure, or the dual-track approach, and that 
<br>"putting Iran in a corner" is not the same as "cutting it 
<br>off" and characterized Italy as a "crucial player," essential 
<br>to catalyzing consensus in Europe. He added that, given 
<br>Iran's critical domestic situation, the regime was not in a 
<br>position to decide anything. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>KEY TO SUCCESS IN AFGHANISTAN 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (C)  With regard to the critical situation in 
<br>Afghanistan, Ronca acknowledged that we must strengthen the 
<br>military aspect of the campaign, but that institution 
<br>building and engaging President Karzai on fighting corruption 
<br>must not be neglected. On the security side, Ronca said that 
<br>Italy will increase its force by 1000 men during the first 
<br>half of 2010 and that its Afghan National Police (ANP) 
<br>training program is a first priority.  As for civilian 
<br>engagement, Italy has committed 465 million euros in various 
<br>civilian sectors, including health, education, and justice. 
<br>Ronca and Marotti stressed the need for better coordination 
<br>of civilian and military activities as an issue that should 
<br>be on the agenda of the January 28 London NATO conference. 
<br>Ronca noted that reaching out to insurgents was a task that 
<br>should also be pursued. The Italians stressed the need for a 
<br>long-term development strategy based on Afghan priorities, 
<br>but which would also include private sector involvement and 
<br>the development of good governance. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>CENTER LEFT PD AIRS FOREIGN POLICY POSITIONS 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C)  Head of the opposition Partito Democratico's (PD) 
<br>Foreign Policy Department Piero Fassino told the Staffdel the 
<br>PD supports President Obama's initiative  to dialogue and 
<br>build bridges with the Islamic world, but is very concerned 
<br>about the blocked MEPP and the "new wave of terror" in 
<br>Afghanistan.  As for Iran, the PD supports pursuing a 
<br>negotiated solution, but Fassino questioned whether the 
<br>current leadership is in a position to negotiate credibly. 
<br>He suggested it could be useful to change the order of 
<br>priorities in Iran; that is, be more flexible on the nuclear 
<br>issue, but harder on human rights.  According to Fassino, the 
<br>greatest risk with nuclear proliferation is that 
<br>irresponsible governments like the one in Iran could gain 
<br>access to nuclear arms, adding that the PD assessed that 
<br>there was little to fear with nations such as India, Britain, 
<br>and France having nuclear weapons.  He asked whether a 
<br>democratic government in Iran might not have a different 
<br>position on the nuclear program. 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (C)  Fassino said the PD supports the GOI's increased 
<br>(military) support for Afghanistan, but stressed that 
<br>strengthening civil and governmental institutions and 
<br>economic development are equally important.  On the MEPP, 
<br>Fassino characterized Netanyahu's proposed 10-month 
<br>settlement freeze "a little window of opportunity," but 
<br>questioned whether it was enough, given the Israelis' refusal 
<br>to discuss (the status of) Jerusalem.  As for Iraq, Fassino 
<br>said the stabilization process must be supported; there was 
<br>no alternative. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>ENI JUSTIFIES IRAN ACTIVITIES 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶11.  ( C ) Energy and gas parastatal Eni (Ente Nazionale 
<br>Idrocarburi) officials told the Congressional delegation that 
<br>it is cooperating to address USG concerns over the company,s 
<br>Iran activities, but insisted that it will continue to 
<br>fulfill its contractual obligations there. The company 
<br>officials said that Eni has understood the USG message to 
<br>reduce its presence in Iran, and as a result it has already 
<br>decreased its Iran activities to a minimum level. The Eni 
<br>officials provided the Staffdel with a copy of the November 
<br>16, 2009 CEO Scaroni letter to Ambassador Thorne that states 
<br>the company,s position (A copy of Eni's letter was provided 
<br>to EEB in November). Referencing this letter, the officials 
<br>pointed out that Eni will not undertake new activities in 
<br>Iran, including no new activities by its subsidiaries, Saipem 
<br> 
<br>ROME 00000087  003.2 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>and Polimeri Europa. They added that following Scaroni,s 
<br>September 16 meetings in Washington the company also gave up 
<br>plans for an MOU with Iran for development of the phase III 
<br>of the Darquain oil field. The officials stated that while EU 
<br>law prevents the Eni from responding to official requests for 
<br>information on its Iran operations, it has been transparent 
<br>in informing the USG on a voluntary basis. 
<br> 
<br>¶12.  ( C ) The Eni officials stated, however, that Eni 
<br>intends to carry out exploration and development activities 
<br>in Iran that fall under its contractual obligations there. 
<br>The officials acknowledged that this is a &gray area8 due 
<br>to the differences of opinion between the company and the USG 
<br>over what is &new8 activity and what is &old.8 The 
<br>company officials said that they hope to clarify this issue 
<br>with Washington during separate meetings in January with 
<br>senior officials from the State Department and Department of 
<br>Treasury. Pressed for details over the company,s existing 
<br>obligations, the officials said that it is under contract to 
<br>meet certain targets of (oil) production in order to 
<br>guarantee defined levels of production within a given time 
<br>frame. They added that Eni must keep a certain threshold of 
<br>production in order to recover its investments in Iran. They 
<br>also explained that Eni receives periodic (possibly 
<br>scheduled) payments by Iran in oil equivalent amounts that 
<br>correspond to the attained target levels of production. 
<br> 
<br>¶13.  ( C ) The Eni officials admitted the frustrating 
<br>difficulties of operating in Iran, but stated that Eni's 
<br>priority is to recover its investments there while meeting EU 
<br>laws. The officials estimated Eni's total Iran investments at 
<br>around $3 billion dollars, of which they said Eni has already 
<br>recovered already about 60 percent (or about $1.7 billion 
<br>according to one Eni representative). The company officials 
<br>said Eni still needs to recover about $1.4 billion from its 
<br>Iran operations. They added that &if all goes as planned8 
<br>Eni will recover this remainder of its investments by the end 
<br>of 2013 or early in 2014. They further explained that Eni's 
<br>Iran contracts provide the possibility of extensions if the 
<br>company is not able to recover its investments within the 
<br>stipulated time frame. The Eni officials cautioned that the 
<br>company may face EU sanctions if it withdraws from Iran due 
<br>to pressure from USG unilateral sanctions.
