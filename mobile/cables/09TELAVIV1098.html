<br>
<br>Summary
<br>---------
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) Organized crime (OC) has longstanding roots in Israel, but
<br>in recent years there has been a sharp increase in the reach and
<br>impact of OC networks. In seeking a competitive advantage in such
<br>lucrative trades as narcotics and prostitution, Israeli crime groups
<br>have demonstrated their ability and willingness to engage in violent
<br>attacks on each other with little regard for innocent bystanders.
<br>The Israeli National Police (INP) and the courts have engaged in a
<br>vigorous campaign against organized crime leaders, including the
<br>creation of a new specialized anti-OC unit, but they remain unable
<br>to cope with the full scope of the problem. Organized crime in
<br>Israel now has global reach, with direct impact inside the United
<br>States. Post is currently utilizing all available tools to deny
<br>Israeli OC figures access to the United States in order to prevent
<br>them from furthering their criminal activities on U.S. soil. End
<br>Summary.
<br>
<br>Crime War Hits the Streets of Israel
<br>-------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) In November 2008, Israeli crime boss Yaakov Alperon was
<br>assassinated in broad daylight in a gruesome attack on the streets
<br>of Tel Aviv, only about a mile away from the Embassy. According to
<br>several media accounts, a motor scooter pulled up alongside
<br>Alperon's car and the rider attached a sophisticated explosive
<br>device with a remote detonator to the car door. The bomb killed
<br>Alperon and his driver, and injured two innocent pedestrians. The
<br>hit was the latest in a series of violent attacks and reprisals, and
<br>indicated a widening crime war in Israel.
<br>
<br>¶3. In July 2008, a 31-year-old Israeli woman was killed by a stray
<br>bullet on the beach in Bat Yam in front of her husband and two
<br>children during a failed assassination attempt on noted crime figure
<br>Rami Amira. In a feud between the Abutbul and Shirazi clans, crime
<br>boss Shalom "Charlie" Abutbul was shot by two gunmen in September
<br>2008, an attack that also wounded three bystanders. In December
<br>2008, Charlie Abutbul's son-in-law, Nati Ohayon, was gunned down in
<br>his car in Netanya. Before the fatal bombing of his car, Alperon
<br>himself had survived at least three previous attempts on his life
<br>before his assassination, and was engaged in an ongoing feud with
<br>the rival Abergil clan (although there are numerous suspects in
<br>Alperon's murder). The day after Alperon's death, two members of
<br>the Abergil syndicate were sentenced for conspiring to kill
<br>Alperon's brother, Nissim, in May 2008.
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) In response to rising concerns for public safety, former
<br>Prime Minister Olmert convened an emergency meeting of top law
<br>enforcement officials, cabinet members, and prosecutors in December
<br>¶2008. He promised to add 1,000 officers to the INP and to allocate
<br>approximately NIS 340 million (USD 81 million) to improve the INP's
<br>technical capabilities. In general, the rise in OC-related violence
<br>has led some public figures to call for emergency state powers to
<br>attack criminal organizations, and OC became a minor but important
<br>issue in the February 2009 Knesset elections. Former Labor Party MK
<br>Ephraim Sneh publicly decried criminal extortion in his campaign
<br>ads, only to have his car torched in apparent retaliation outside
<br>his home in Herzliya.
<br>
<br>Background
<br>------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) Organized criminal activity is not a new phenomenon in
<br>Israel, and major crime families are well known to the Israeli
<br>public (the Alperons even featured in a recent reality television
<br>program). Five or six crime families have traditionally dominated
<br>OC in Israel, although the names and makeup of these syndicates have
<br>fluctuated in recent years. The Abergil, Abutbul, Alperon, and
<br>Rosenstein organizations are among the most well known, but recent
<br>arrests and assassinations have created a power vacuum at the top.
<br>New names such as Mulner, Shirazi, Cohen and Domrani have moved
<br>quickly to fill the gap. Other up-and-coming groups include the
<br>Harari, Ohana, and Kdoshim families. There are also a number of
<br>rival families active in the underworld of Israel's Arab sector.
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) Traditional OC activities in Israel include illegal
<br>neighborhood casinos, prostitution rings, extortion, and loan
<br>sharking, with each family controlling a different geographic
<br>region. The Alperon family, for instance, dominates the Sharon
<br>region, while the Abutbul operation is based in the coastal city of
<br>Netanya. The focus is largely on easy money guaranteed by the
<br>limited use of violence. Criminal involvement in the recycling
<br>business, for example, has been well covered in the press. OC
<br>
<br>families collect bottles illegally from municipal recycling bins and
<br>restaurants, return them at the collection centers claiming twice
<br>the actual numbers, and pocket the change for millions in profits.
<br>
<br>Not Your Grandfather's Mob
<br>---------------------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) Despite their notoriety, OC figures have generally been
<br>viewed as a nuisance to be handled by local police. Law enforcement
<br>resources were directed to more existential security threats from
<br>terrorists and enemy states. In recent years, however, the rules of
<br>the game have changed. According to xxxxx, the old school of Israel 
<br>OC is giving way to a new, more violent, breed of crime. xxxxx told conoffs that the new style of
<br>crime features knowledge of hi-tech explosives acquired from service
<br>in the Israeli Defense Forces, and a willingness to use
<br>indiscriminate violence, at least against rival gang leaders. New
<br>OC business also includes technology-related crimes, such as stock
<br>market and credit card fraud, and operates on a global scale.
<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU) As the reach of Israeli OC has grown, so have the stakes.
<br>Crime families are working further from home and exporting violence
<br>abroad. Older gambling schemes have grown to include sprawling
<br>casino franchises in Eastern Europe. The Abutbul family began its
<br>gambling business in Romania over a decade ago, and now owns the
<br>Europe-wide Casino Royale network. In 2002, Israeli OC turf wars
<br>spilled into Europe when Yaakov Abergil and Felix Abutbul were
<br>killed two months apart. Abutbul was gunned down in front of his
<br>casino in Prague in a show of force by the Abergils as they
<br>attempted to capture a portion of the European gambling market.
<br>
<br>¶9. (SBU) Israeli OC now plays a significant role in the global drug
<br>trade, providing both a local consumer market and an important
<br>transit point to Europe and the United States. In 2004, Zeev
<br>Rosenstein was arrested in Israel for possession of 700,000 ecstasy
<br>tablets in his New York apartment, destined for distribution in the
<br>U.S. market. He was ultimately extradited to the United States in
<br>2006, where he is currently serving a 12-year prison sentence. Two
<br>other crime figures, Meir Abergil and Israel Ozifa, are also facing
<br>U.S. extradition charges on charges that include smuggling 100,000
<br>ecstasy tablets into the United States.
<br>
<br>¶10. (SBU) The prostitution business has also grown beyond the
<br>neighborhood brothel. In March 2009, the INP arrested twelve
<br>suspects in what is believed to be the largest Israeli-led human
<br>trafficking network unearthed to date. Ring leader Rami Saban and
<br>his associates were charged with smuggling thousands of women from
<br>the former Soviet Union and forcing them to work as prostitutes in
<br>Israel, Cyprus, Belgium, and Great Britain. Some women were flown
<br>to Egypt and smuggled across the Sinai border by Bedouins.
<br>
<br>Law Enforcement Steps up the Pressure
<br>-------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶11. (SBU) After years of perceived inaction, in 2008 the INP
<br>created a new unit called Lahav 433. The elite unit operates under
<br>the direct command of the police commissioner, and is charged
<br>specifically with infiltrating and eliminating Israel's major crime
<br>syndicates. Lahav 433 also cooperates closely with district
<br>investigative units to combat smaller criminal organizations, many
<br>of which are aligned with the larger crime families.
<br>
<br>¶12. (SBU) Following Alperon's assassination, the INP initiated a
<br>series of raids that led to the arrests of a number of leading crime
<br>figures. Among their targets were Aviv and Adam Abutbul, sons of
<br>crime-family head Charlie Abutbul, both charged with possession of
<br>illegal weapons. (A third brother, Francois, is already facing
<br>murder charges for a nightclub killing in 2004.) Police also
<br>arrested gangland figure Amir Mulner for weapons possession and
<br>conspiracy to commit a crime. Mulner is known to be an explosives
<br>expert by army training, and is a suspect in Yaakov Alperon's
<br>murder. He is also believed to be managing affairs for Rosenstein
<br>while the latter serves his sentence in the United States.
<br>
<br>¶13. (SBU) Yaakov Alperon's brother Nissim was arrested with 18
<br>others in December 2008, in what was reported to be a "mafia
<br>meeting" in a Tel Aviv-area caf. According to the Jerusalem Post,
<br>the group may have been planning a revenge attack for his brother's
<br>recent assassination. Alperon's son Dror, recently dismissed from
<br>his army service for disorderly behavior, also faces several counts
<br>of assault and was convicted on extortion charges. Also in
<br>December, police in Netanya launched several raids on illegal
<br>gambling houses and the homes of suspected money launderers with
<br>ties to the crime families. In Ashdod, brothers Roni and David
<br>Harari were arrested on charges of extortion. Regional police stuck
<br>a blow against the Jerusalem Gang, and convicted its leader Itzik
<br>Bar Muha.
<br>
<br>Skepticism Hovers Over GOI Efforts
<br>----------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶14. (SBU)xxxxx told conoffs that
<br>"thousands of foot soldiers" remain active on the streets despite
<br>these aggressive anti-OC operations. He noted that approximately
<br>2,000 people attended Alperon's very public funeral. xxxxx
<br>expressed skepticism that recent arrests will bear fruit in the long
<br>term without a sustained commitment to enforcement. He noted that
<br>many of the crime leaders remain active while in prison and their
<br>operations are not hampered significantly even when they are
<br>convicted and jailed.
<br>
<br>¶15. (SBU) In December 2008, former Prime Minister Olmert himself
<br>admitted that efforts to combat OC have long been diluted among
<br>different agencies, and that INP technology lags far behind that
<br>allocated to security services for counterterrorism. Given the
<br>recent change in government and the current economic crisis, there
<br>is public skepticism as to whether GOI promises to remedy the
<br>situation will be fulfilled. In 2003, following a failed
<br>assassination attempt on Rosenstein, then Prime Minister Ariel
<br>Sharon made similar promises to commit manpower and resources to
<br>combating the problem.
<br>
<br>¶16. (SBU) It is not entirely clear to what extent OC elements have
<br>penetrated the Israeli establishment and corrupted public officials.
<br>The INP insists that such instances are rare, despite the
<br>occasional revelation of crooked police officers in the press.
<br>Nevertheless, there have been several dramatic revelations in recent
<br>years that indicate a growing problem. In 2004, former government
<br>minister Gonen Segev was arrested for trying to smuggle thousands of
<br>ecstasy pills into Israel, a case that produced considerable
<br>circumstantial evidence of his involvement in OC. The election of
<br>Inbal Gavrieli to the Knesset in 2003 as a member of Likud raised
<br>concerns about OC influence in the party's Central Committee.
<br>Gavrieli is the daughter of a suspected crime boss, and she
<br>attempted to use her parliamentary immunity to block investigations
<br>into her father's business. (Gavrieli is no longer a member of the
<br>Knesset.) Just last month, Israeli politicos and OC figures came
<br>together for the funeral of Likud party activist Shlomi Oz, who
<br>served time in prison in the 1990s for extortion on behalf of the
<br>Alperon family. Among those in attendance was Omri Sharon, son of
<br>former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who was himself convicted in
<br>2006 on illegal fundraising charges unrelated to OC.
<br>
<br>Courts Testing New Powers
<br>--------------------------
<br>
<br>¶17. (SBU) In 2003, the GOI passed anti-OC legislation that carries
<br>a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment for heading a criminal
<br>organization and three years for working in such an organization.
<br>The law defines such a body as a group of people working in an
<br>"organized, methodical and ongoing pattern to commit offenses that
<br>are defined by the laws of Israel as crimes." The law also allows
<br>for property forfeiture, both in the wake of conviction and in cases
<br>where it is proven to belong to a criminal organization.
<br>
<br>¶18. (SBU) Until recently, xxxxx, judges and lawyers have been
<br>slow to make use of this authority, and are hampered by a lack of
<br>resources, insufficient understanding of the tools at their
<br>disposal, and reticence to mete out tough sentences. A witness
<br>protection program for those who testify against OC is just now
<br>getting off the ground, and is not backed by any specific
<br>legislation. Nevertheless, on March 16th, a Tel Aviv district court
<br>took the important step of sentencing 14 convicted criminals
<br>belonging to two mob organizations in Ramle and Jaffa to up to 27
<br>years in prison.
<br>
<br>¶19. (SBU) Increased efforts by Israeli authorities to combat OC
<br>have engendered retaliatory threats of violence. Recent press
<br>reports indicate that as many as 10 Israeli judges are currently
<br>receiving 24-hour protection by the police against the threat of
<br>violence from members of crime organizations. Israeli OC appears to
<br>be intent on intimidating judges personally, as a way of influencing
<br>the legal process. Judges in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and Haifa have
<br>been assigned police protection, underscoring the depth of the
<br>problem.
<br>
<br>Israeli Crime Reaches American Shores
<br>--------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶20. (SBU) Israel's multi-ethnic population provides a deep well of
<br>opportunity for Israeli OC to expand into new territory. Most
<br>Israeli crime families trace their roots to North Africa or Eastern
<br>Europe, and many of their Israeli operatives hold foreign passports
<br>allowing them to move freely in European countries, most of which
<br>participate in the visa waiver program with the United States.
<br>Approximately one million Russians moved to Israel following the
<br>dissolution of the Soviet Union, and Russian citizens no longer
<br>require visas to enter Israel. Many Russian oligarchs of Jewish
<br>origin and Jewish members of OC groups have received Israeli
<br>citizenship, or at least maintain residences in the country. Little
<br>is known about the full extent of Russian criminal activity in
<br>Israel, but sources in the police estimate that Russian OC has
<br>laundered as much as USD 10 billion through Israeli holdings. While
<br>most Israeli OC families are native-born and the stereotype that
<br>Russian immigrants tend to be mobsters is greatly overblown,
<br>indigenous OC groups routinely employ "muscle" from the former
<br>Soviet Union.
<br>
<br>¶21. (SBU) The profit motive serves as a great unifier among
<br>Israel's diverse demographic groups. According to xxxxx, some
<br>Amsterdam-based Hasidic groups allegedly are implicated in
<br>international drug smuggling through links to Israeli OC. Arab and
<br>Jewish Israeli criminals routinely cooperate and form alliances to
<br>expand control of lucrative drug, car theft and extortion rackets.
<br>Even hostile and closed borders pose few obstacles to OC groups.
<br>According to the INP, 43% of intercepted heroin in 2008 was smuggled
<br>from Lebanon, 37% from Jordan, and 12% from Egypt.
<br>
<br>Israeli OC Operating Freely in United States
<br>---------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶22. (SBU) Given the volume of travel and trade between the United
<br>States and Israel, it is not surprising that Israeli OC has also
<br>gained a foothold in America. Over the last decade, media reports
<br>have detailed a number of high-profile cases involving Israeli OC,
<br>ranging from large-scale drug deals to murder. The ongoing Central
<br>District of California grand jury investigation against the Abergil
<br>family, where a RICO conspiracy case was initiated in December 2007,
<br>best demonstrates the full extent of such criminal activity.
<br>Investigators have linked Yitzhak Abergil and his entire network to
<br>crimes of "embezzlement, extortion, kidnapping, and money
<br>laundering." Yitzhak Abergil is currently under arrest in Israel
<br>and facing extradition for related charges linking him to the murder
<br>of Israeli drug dealer Samy Attias on U.S. soil.
<br>
<br>¶23. (SBU) As part of an ongoing effort to track Israeli OC through
<br>media reports and police sources, Post so far has identified 16
<br>families and 78 related individuals who are at the center of Israeli
<br>organized criminal activity. The consular section has revoked
<br>several visas for those who have been convicted of crimes in Israel,
<br>but many OC figures have no prior criminal convictions and carry no
<br>visa ineligibilities. As a result, many hold valid nonimmigrant
<br>visas to the United States and have traveled freely or attempted to
<br>travel for a variety of purposes.
<br>
<br>¶24. (SBU) In March 2009, Post received information from law
<br>enforcement authorities that convicted criminal and member of the
<br>Abergil organization, Mordechai Yair Hasin, along with his pregnant
<br>wife and child, was intending to flee Israel for Los Angeles on
<br>valid tourist visas. Hasin's visa was revoked based on his
<br>conviction, as were his family's visas after they were determined to
<br>be intending immigrants.
<br>
<br>¶25. (SBU) As in the Hasin case, Post is using every available tool
<br>to limit OC travel to the United States, but such efforts are not
<br>always successful. In June 2008, Post issued Adam Abitbul a valid
<br>tourist visa. Abitbul had no prior criminal convictions, and
<br>carried no visa ineligibilities. Several months later, Post
<br>received information from the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD)
<br>that he had traveled to the United States to carry out a hit.
<br>Abitbul returned to Israel prematurely for his father's funeral, at
<br>which time Post revoked his visa. (Post can only revoke the visas of
<br>Israeli citizens while in country.) In a similar case, in October
<br>2008 Post issued Moshe Bar Muha a tourist visa; he claimed to be
<br>traveling for medical treatment. Post subsequently received
<br>information from the LAPD that Bar Muha is in fact the brother of
<br>Itzik Bar Muha of the Jerusalem Gang (see above) and a convicted
<br>criminal.
<br>
<br>¶26. (SBU) As recently as March 2009, Zvika Ben Shabat, Yaacov
<br>Avitan, and Tzuri Rokah requested visas to attend a
<br>"security-related convention" in Las Vegas. According to local
<br>media reports, all three had involvement with OC. Post asked the
<br>applicants to provide police reports for any criminal records in
<br>Israel, but without such evidence there is no immediate
<br>ineligibility for links to OC. Luckily, all three have so far
<br>failed to return for continued adjudication of their applications.
<br>Nevertheless, it is fair to assume that many known OC figures hold
<br>valid tourist visas to the United States and travel freely.
<br>
<br>Comment: Israeli OC Slipping Through the Consular Cracks
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---------
<br>
<br>¶27. (SBU) Given the growing reach and lethal methods of Israeli OC,
<br>blocking the travel of known OC figures to the United States is a
<br>matter of great concern to Post. Through collaboration with Israeli
<br>and U.S. law enforcement authorities, Post has developed an
<br>extensive database and placed lookouts for OC figures and their foot
<br>soldiers. Nevertheless, the above visa cases demonstrate the
<br>challenges that have arisen since the termination of the Visas Shark
<br>in September 2008. Unlike OC groups from the former Soviet Union,
<br>Italy, China, and Central America, application of INA
<br>212(a)(3)(A)(ii) against Israeli OC is not specifically authorized
<br>per Foreign Affairs Manual 40.31 N5.3. As such, Israelis who are
<br>known to work for or belong to OC families are not automatically
<br>ineligible for travel to the United States.
