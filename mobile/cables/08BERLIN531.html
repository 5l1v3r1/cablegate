<br>------- 
<br>Summary 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C)  The German Grand Coalition will increasingly face 
<br>tensions created by the need for the lead candidates to 
<br>position themselves for the 2009 national electoral campaign. 
<br> Chancellor Angela Merkel and Foreign Minister Frank-Walter 
<br>Steinmeier both remain highly popular.  Merkel, however, 
<br>faces political risks if the economy turns for the worse.  In 
<br>the second half of this year, as the Social Democratic Party 
<br>(SPD) moves closer to a decision about its chancellor 
<br>candidate, potential candidate Steinmeier will likely face 
<br>scrutiny and criticism from his own party's left-wing.  It is 
<br>too early to predict the likely coalition outcome in 2009 -- 
<br>although Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Christian 
<br>Social Union (CSU) are likely to come out ahead, they may not 
<br>have a better coalition option than continuing the current 
<br>Grand Coalition with the SPD.  U.S. foreign policy is not 
<br>likely to play a central role in the campaign leading up to 
<br>Germany's national elections in fall 2009.  Improved 
<br>U.S.-German relations under Merkel and German fascination 
<br>with the vibrant democratic process in the U.S. primary 
<br>elections have played significant roles in improving German 
<br>attitudes towards the U.S., thereby dampening the likelihood 
<br>that the SPD will use anti-American rhetoric to rally voters 
<br>as former chancellor Gerhard Schroeder did in 2002.  End 
<br>summary. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br>Merkel's Possible Archilles Heel: The Economy 
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (U) Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) remains highly popular 
<br>among Germans, who view her as an effective leader with a 
<br>strong international stature.  Her approval rating is 71 
<br>percent.  In large part due to Merkel's popularity, the CDU 
<br>has held a commanding 8- to 14-point lead over the SPD in 
<br>polls over the last year. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) Although Merkel's high popularity is expected to 
<br>continue, she faces diffuse risks on economic issues.  CDU 
<br>parliamentarians suggest that an economic downturn would be 
<br>the principal threat to Merkel's high popularity  Economic 
<br>forecasts currently favor Merkel, with projections of 1.6 to 
<br>1.8 percent growth for this year (though slightly lower for 
<br>2009), but with no real evidence of recession despite the 
<br>global slowdown. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) Among CDU leaders there is a sense that the CDU may 
<br>have peaked (perhaps too early) and that caution is the 
<br>watchword.  Merkel, who campaigned in 2005 on a program of 
<br>economic liberalization and watched a commanding lead in the 
<br>polls nearly vanish during the campaign, appears to be moving 
<br>toward the political center in an attempt to expand her base 
<br>and consolidate centrist support that the SPD is losing 
<br>because of its leftward shift.  She is demonstrating 
<br>ever-greater focus on domestic policy and espousing popular 
<br>middle class enticements such as pension increases, a longer 
<br>duration of unemployment benefits for older workers, and 
<br>enhancement of nursing care insurance.  While many consider 
<br>this move to be politically smart, some on the CDU's 
<br>right-wing have criticized the Chancellor for abandoning core 
<br>CDU values. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----- 
<br>Steinmeier Could Get Roughed Up by SPD's Left Wing 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----- 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) Social Democrats have speculated in recent months that 
<br>SPD Chairman Kurt Beck will eventually defer to the much more 
<br>popular Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier as the 
<br>party's eventual chancellor candidate (ref A).  SPD insiders 
<br>consider this a 50-50 proposition.  Kurt Beck's recent 
<br>victory in guiding competing factions of the SPD to agreement 
<br>on privatization of the railway monopoly Deutsche Bahn may 
<br>help shore up his position (septel).  It is uncertain whether 
<br>Steinmeier would choose to accept the SPD nomination at a 
<br>time when the SPD is hovering in the mid 20's in the polls 
<br>and its electoral prospects seem poor.  Note: In any case, 
<br>Steinmeier will run for political office, a federal 
<br>parliament seat from Brandenburg City, for the first time in 
<br>¶2009.  End note. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) Steinmeier would face some detractors in his own 
<br> 
<br>BERLIN 00000531  002 OF 002 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>party.  Deputy SPD Chair Andrea Nahles, the leading left-wing 
<br>critic of Steinmeier's centrist approach, told Political M/C 
<br>that she was unhappy that "the U.S. knows more about 
<br>Steinmeier than I do," referring to Steinmeier's role as 
<br>Chancellery Chief of Staff and Intelligence Coordinator under 
<br>Gerhard Schroeder.  Nahles suggested strongly that the left 
<br>wing of the SPD could portray Steinmeier as too close to the 
<br>U.S. on intelligence-related issues, especially his role in 
<br>the Murat Kurnaz affair (ref B), thereby damaging his 
<br>candidacy. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) Nahles admitted, however, that the SPD likely would do 
<br>better at the polls with Steinmeier as chancellor candidate 
<br>(between 30 and 35 percent of the vote).  This would mean 
<br>more SPD parliamentarians holding onto their seats -- a 
<br>consideration that could have an effect on the SPD's choice. 
<br>Nahles added that Steinmeier "has little experience in 
<br>managing the party, but he's a fast learner." 
<br> 
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br>Grand Coalition Fated to Continue? 
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (C) Deputy CDU national chairman and Lower Saxony 
<br>Minister-President Christian Wulff (CDU) told the DCM that 
<br>another grand coalition is the most likely outcome in 2009 if 
<br>the political landscape does not change significantly in the 
<br>coming months.  The SPD's Nahles agrees.  While Merkel and 
<br>the CDU still prefer to govern with the Free Democrats (FDP), 
<br>the numbers may not suffice for a majority.  Although 
<br>experiments such as the CDU-Greens coalition in Hamburg are 
<br>enticing, replicating them at the national level remains 
<br>difficult. 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C) Comment:  The CDU's fear of opening up its flanks to 
<br>SPD attacks -- and the SPD's self-obsession during a period 
<br>of turmoil in the party -- reveal a degree of caution on 
<br>policy issues that is remarkable even by German standards. 
<br>This is reflected in German caution on foreign policy issues 
<br>of interest to us such as Afghanistan and Iran.  A particular 
<br>USG concern is whether the SPD or others will try to employ 
<br>anti-American rhetoric to curry voter support, much as former 
<br>chancellor Gerhard Schroeder did in 2002.  Even SPD 
<br>left-wingers like Nahles tell us, however, that foreign 
<br>policy is not as great a consideration for German voters as 
<br>it was around the time of the Iraq war, and therefore will 
<br>not likely be a decisive factor in next year's national 
<br>elections.  It is also important to note that German 
<br>attitudes towards the U.S. have improved over the past year 
<br>due to our improved bilateral relations and German 
<br>fascination with democracy on display in the U.S. primary 
<br>elections.  The current improvement is evidenced by a recent 
<br>Harris poll which showed a dramatic 21 percentage-point 
<br>increase in the number of Germans who regard the U.S. as a 
<br>trustworthy partner.  Also, the German federal election 
<br>campaign will occur during what is expected here to be an 
<br>extended popular "honeymoon" for the new U.S. administration. 
<br> Consequently, German politicians might perceive less 
<br>political advantage in a critical stance toward the U.S.  End 
<br>comment.
