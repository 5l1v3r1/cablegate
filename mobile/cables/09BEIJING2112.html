<br>4 (b/d).
<br>
<br>Summary
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) The need for consensus and the desire to protect
<br>vested interests are the main drivers of Politburo Standing
<br>Committee (PBSC) decision-making and Chinese leadership
<br>dynamics in general, according to Embassy contacts with
<br>access to leadership circles. Contacts have variously
<br>described relations at the top of China's Party-state
<br>structure as akin to those in the executive suite of a large
<br>corporation, as determined by the interplay of powerful
<br>interests, or as shaped by competition between "princelings"
<br>with family ties to party elders and "shopkeepers" who have
<br>risen through the ranks of the Party. End Summary.
<br>
<br>Hu Jintao as Chairman of the Board?
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Politburo
<br>decision-making is similar to executive decision-making in a
<br>large company, two well-connected contacts say. xxxxx that Party General
<br>Secretary Hu Jintao could be compared to the Chairman of the
<br>Board or CEO of a big corporation.xxxxx, used the
<br>same analogy in a May 18 meeting with PolOffs. xxxxx said that
<br>PBSC decision making was akin to a corporation in which the
<br>greater the stock ownership the greater the voice in
<br>decisions. "Hu Jintao holds the most stock, so his views
<br>carry the greatest weight," and so on down the hierarchy, but
<br>the PBSC did not formally vote, xxxxx. "It is a
<br>consensus system," he maintained, "in which members can
<br>exercise veto power."
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) xxxxx had told PolOff previously that he knew "on very
<br>good authority" that "major policies," such as the country's
<br>core policy on Taiwan or North Korea, had to be decided by
<br>the full 25-member Politburo. Other more specific matters,
<br>he said, were decided by the nine-member PBSC alone. Some
<br>issues were put to a formal vote, while others were merely
<br>discussed until a consensus was reached. Either way, xxxxx
<br>stated sarcastically, the Politburo was the "most democratic
<br>body in the world," the only place in China where true
<br>democracy existed. xxxxx said that although there was
<br>"something" to the notion of a rough factional balancing at
<br>the top between the Jiang Zemin-Shanghai group and the Hu-Wen
<br>group, neither group was dominant, and major issues had to be
<br>decided by consensus.
<br>
<br>Leadership Dynamics: Driven by Vested Interests
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---
<br>
<br>¶4. (C)xxxxx asserted to PolOff March 12 that the Party should be
<br>viewed primarily as a collection of interest groups. There
<br>was no "reform wing," xxxxx claimed.xxxxx made the same
<br>argument in several discussions with PolOff over the past
<br>year, asserting that China's top leadership had carved up
<br>China's economic "pie," creating an ossified system in which
<br>"vested interests" drove decision-making and impeded reform
<br>as leaders maneuvered to ensure that those interests were not
<br>threatened. It was "well known," xxxxx stated, that former
<br>Premier Li Peng and his family controlled all electric power
<br>interests; PBSC member and security czar Zhou Yongkang and
<br>associates controlled the oil interests; the late former top
<br>leader Chen Yun's family controlled most of the PRC's banking
<br>sector; PBSC member and Chinese People's Political
<br>Consultative Conference Chairman Jia Qinglin was the main
<br>interest behind major Beijing real estate developments; Hu
<br>Jintao's son-in -law ran Sina.com; and Wen Jiabao's wife
<br>controlled China's precious gems sector.
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) Note: In a development that could fan the "vested
<br>interest" rumor mill, China-related websites in the United
<br>States this week were reporting that a Chinese security
<br>technology company with links to Hu's eldest son, Hu Haifeng,
<br>was being investigated in Namibia on charges of corruption.
<br>A July 19 article in a Malaysian paper, cited by a U.S.-based
<br>dissident website, wenxuecity.com, reported that Hu Haifeng
<br>was a "potential witness" in the case but was not himself a
<br>suspect. The report said that the younger Hu was a former
<br>CEO of Nuctech and currently the Party Secretary of its
<br>
<br>Beijing 00002112 002 of 002
<br>
<br>
<br>parent company, Tsinghua Holding Co. Ltd. According to the
<br>China Digital Times website at the University of California
<br>Berkeley's China Internet Project, the Central Propaganda
<br>Department on July 21 issued orders to block any reference to
<br>the case in the PRC media. End note.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) xxxxx, had told PolOff earlier that
<br>leaders had close ties to powerful economic actors,
<br>especially real estate developers and corporate leaders, who
<br>in some cases were officials themselves. The same was true
<br>at the local level, xxxxx stated. He claimed that these
<br>interest networks had policy implications since most local
<br>leaders had "bought" their positions and wanted an immediate
<br>financial "return" on their investment. They always
<br>supported fast-growth policies and opposed reform efforts
<br>that might harm their interests, xxxxx. Vested
<br>interests were especially inclined to oppose media openness,
<br>he said, lest someone question the shady deals behind land
<br>transactions. As a result, the proponents of "growth first"
<br>would always be in a stronger position than those who favored
<br>controlling inflation or taking care of the poor, xxxxx.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) xxxxx that the central feature of leadership
<br>politics was the need to protect oneself and one's family
<br>from attack after leaving office. Thus, current leaders
<br>carefully cultivated proteges who would defend their
<br>interests once they stepped down. It was natural, xxxxx said,
<br>that someone like Xi Jinping, who maintained a
<br>non-threatening low profile and had never made enemies, would
<br>be elevated by Jiang Zemin and Zeng Qinghong. Xi would act
<br>to ensure that Jiang was not harassed or that Jiang's corrupt
<br>son would not be arrested, xxxxx.
<br>
<br>Princelings vs. Shopkeepers
<br>---------------------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (C)xxxxx, separately
<br>described leadership alignments at the top of the CCP as
<br>shaped largely by one's "princeling" or "shopkeeper" lineage.
<br>In separate conversations in recent months, xxxxx said that some argued that China's
<br>"princelings," the sons and daughters of prominent Communist
<br>Party officials, including many who helped found the PRC,
<br>shared a perception that they, as the descendents of those
<br>who shed blood in the name of the Communist revolution, had a
<br>"right" to continue to lead China and protect the fruits of
<br>that revolution. Such a mindset could potentially place the
<br>"princelings" at odds with Party members who do not have
<br>similar pedigrees, xxxxx, such as President
<br>Hu Jintao, Premier Wen Jiabao and Party members with a CYL
<br>background, who were derisively referred to as "shopkeepers'
<br>sons." xxxxx had heard some princeling
<br>families denounce those without revolutionary pedigrees by
<br>saying, "While my father was bleeding and dying for China,
<br>your father was selling shoelaces."
