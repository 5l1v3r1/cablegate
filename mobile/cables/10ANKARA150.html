<br> 
<br>Summary 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C)  Reports of coup plots against PM Erdogan's 
<br>Islamist-leaning government have been a staple of the Turkish 
<br>media since 2007.  Despite protests by Turkey's top brass 
<br>that there is no substance to the allegations, a growing 
<br>percentage of the population believes that at least some 
<br>elements within the military have been plotting to undermine 
<br>or even overthrow the AKP-led government.  The coup 
<br>allegations have served as fodder for the Ergenekon 
<br>prosecution team and some of the plots have been included in 
<br>the formal indictments against senior retired military 
<br>officers.  The net result of these allegations has been a 
<br>gradual erosion of the public trust toward the military.  The 
<br>latest reports related to the "Sledgehammer" plan (ref a) 
<br>come at a time when the government is preparing the process 
<br>of amending the constitution to allow military personnel to 
<br>be tried in civilian courts (ref b).  With the pro-Islamist 
<br>media fanning the flames and the Turkish General Staff's 
<br>consistently inadequate responses to each allegation, public 
<br>opinion is becoming less unquestioning vis a vis the 
<br>military; this could help strengthen AKP's position as it 
<br>mulls steps to amend the Turkish constitution in order to 
<br>affect a shift in the civil-military balance in its favor, 
<br>although AKP,s own support has eroded considerably over the 
<br>past year.  End Summary. 
<br> 
<br>Coup Chronicles: A Review 
<br>------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) Over the course of the last two-and-a-half years, the 
<br>Turkish military has faced a number of allegations of coup 
<br>plotting having occurred within its ranks, especially in the 
<br>2003 to 2004 period.  These allegations have increased in 
<br>tempo over the last year, with the liberal daily "Taraf" 
<br>("Side") -- whose tagline is: "To Think is to Take Sides" -- 
<br>leading the charge in breaking many of the often-sensational 
<br>stories that draw on leaked information from unnamed military 
<br>or judicial sources.  (Comment: Taraf owner Basar Arslan has 
<br>publicly dismissed claims that Taraf is secretly funded by 
<br>the Fetullah Gulen movement. End Comment).  Paras 8-14 
<br>outline the key allegations that have surfaced in the Turkish 
<br>media since 2007. 
<br> 
<br>Common Threads 
<br>-------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) One of the common threads in this review is that the 
<br>alleged plans are all variations on a theme: they all involve 
<br>efforts to sow chaos or foment public opposition to the AKP 
<br>and to create the conditions for a military intervention. 
<br>None of the alleged plots involve a direct military takeover 
<br>(Comment: The military's problem in such a scenario is that 
<br>it knows its interventions and coup plots are not popular 
<br>among the population.  The last "successful" coup -- in 1980 
<br>-- occurred in response to a massive breakdown of public 
<br>order as armed political, ethnic and criminal gangs engaged 
<br>in violent attacks.  The core accusation in these current 
<br>scenarios is the allegation that the military this time would 
<br>foment the violence themselves, blaming radical, Islamic and 
<br>other groups, and then step in to "restore order" after the 
<br>government fails to do so.  End Comment.) 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) Another common theme is that all the allegations put 
<br>the military in an almost impossible position of having to 
<br>prove a negative -- that it did not engage in the planning 
<br>actions alleged by the media reports -- to a public, some 
<br>parts of whom are increasingly suspicious of the military 
<br>with each new claim.  While we may never know the extent to 
<br>which each of these allegations are true, it is clear from 
<br>statements by former Turkish General Staff Chief Gen. Ozkok 
<br>that, at the very least, there was serious consideration 
<br>given within the military in 2003 to 2004 to overthrow the 
<br> 
<br>ANKARA 00000150  002 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>AKP-led government. 
<br> 
<br>Polling Data and Net Effect Thus Far 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) The series of allegations has been eroding the 
<br>public's confidence in the military.  While the military 
<br>still enjoys strong support among the public -- one poll by 
<br>Genar Polling in November 2009 indicated that 80.6 percent of 
<br>those surveyed viewed the military as the institution that 
<br>inspires most confidence, 15 points above the presidency, 
<br>which came in second -- this support has slipped.  A poll 
<br>conducted by A&G Polling in January indicated that while 
<br>public support for the military was around 90 percent before 
<br>the Ergenekon investigations began, public support has 
<br>dropped to 63.4 percent.  Ipsos KMG also published a poll in 
<br>early January indicating the trust in the military had 
<br>declined from 85 to 90 percent before the Ergenekon 
<br>allegations, to 73 percent in late 2009.  Another poll 
<br>conducted in early January by Turkish polling firm MetroPoll, 
<br>before the "Sledgehammer" story broke, found that 30 percent 
<br>of respondents in the January poll indicated that their trust 
<br>in the military has decreased.  55 percent of respondents 
<br>also believed that "there is a group within the military 
<br>which is preparing to stage a coup," a rise of 7 percent from 
<br>July 2009 figures.  Despite the decreasing confidence in the 
<br>military indicated by one of three respondents, 62 percent of 
<br>respondents did not believe that the military would stage 
<br>another coup. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) Secularists who question the motives of the AKP and 
<br>the timing of each new coup plot allegation are convinced 
<br>that most of the claims are a combination of fabrication and 
<br>manipulation of actual military documents and that there is a 
<br>systematic campaign to erode the trust of the military.  TGS 
<br>chief Basbug has led this charge, calling the series of media 
<br>stories an "asymmetric attack" targeting the Turkish Armed 
<br>Forces.  Even as he denounced the media reports, however, 
<br>Basbug has also clearly committed the military to supporting 
<br>democracy and the rule of law and has stated that the era of 
<br>coups in Turkey is over (ref. b). 
<br> 
<br>Comment: Stage is Set for Constitutional Reform 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -- 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) With the Constitutional Court's unanimous decision to 
<br>overturn a law extending civilian jurisdiction over military 
<br>personnel for crimes including coup plotting (ref c), the 
<br>government has announced that it plans to seek a referendum 
<br>to change Turkey's constitution to affect this change.  Many 
<br>of the other possible constitutional reforms being considered 
<br>by the government -- such as changing the structure of the 
<br>Constitutional Court and limiting clauses often used to 
<br>justify the prosecution of nationalist Kurds and Islamist 
<br>politicians -- would attract the opposition of the military 
<br>and its political supporters.  The apparent rise in distrust 
<br>among the Turkish populace toward the military, particularly 
<br>after "Sledgehammer," which allegedly would have targeted 
<br>average Turks in an arbitrary manner, could work to the AKP's 
<br>advantage as it looks to further shift the balance of power 
<br>in civ-mil relations through constitutional reforms, although 
<br>AKP,s own standing is greatly diminished from only one year 
<br>ago. 
<br> 
<br>COUP DIARIES AND ALLEGED PLOTS 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (SBU) Excerpts of diary entries dating back to 2003 and 
<br>2004 allegedly belonging to then-Naval Forces Commander 
<br>Admiral Ozden Ornek were first published by the weekly 
<br>"Nokta" in 2007 (Comment: The magazine was closed shortly 
<br>after it published these documents.  End Comment).  The diary 
<br>entries -- popularly known as the "Coup Diaries" -- laid out 
<br>in detail discussions among senior military officers of steps 
<br>the military needed to take to unseat the Islamist-leaning 
<br>Justice and Development Party, which came to power in 2002. 
<br>"Sarikiz" ("Blondie") was the initial coup plan developed by 
<br>then-Jandarma Commander General Eruygur, which involved a 
<br>coordinated effort among the military and other elements of 
<br>Turkey's secular elite, to effect the removal of the AKP from 
<br>power.  The plot allegedly had the support of all the other 
<br>force commanders at the time (Land Forces Commander General 
<br>Aytac Yalman, Air Forces Commander General Ibrahim Firtina, 
<br> 
<br>ANKARA 00000150  003 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>and Naval Forces Commander Admiral Ornek).  Then-Turkish 
<br>General Staff (TGS) Chief General Hilmi Ozkok reportedly 
<br>rejected the coup proposal, which led Eruygur and former 
<br>First Army Commander General Hursuit Tolon to develop other 
<br>plots entitled "Ayisigi" ("Moonlight") and "Yakamoz" 
<br>("Phosphorescence"), which provided operational details of a 
<br>coup that would involve the removal of General Ozkok and the 
<br>restructuring of the military.  Other related plans related 
<br>to the plot with code names "Eldiven" ("Glove") and 
<br>"Demiryumruk" ("Iron Fist") reportedly provided more details 
<br>about steps to be taken in the aftermath of a successful coup. 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (SBU) These plots were included in the Ergenekon 
<br>prosecutors' second indictment in March 2009, and provided 
<br>the legal basis for the detention of retired generals Eruygur 
<br>and Tolon (who were initially arrested in July 2008 and were 
<br>detained without formal charges until the release of the 
<br>indictment).  Eruygur has been identified as the alleged head 
<br>of Ergenekon while Tolon is considered a leading member. 
<br>Retired force commanders Firtina, Ornek, and Yalman were 
<br>interviewed by Ergenekon prosecutors in early December 2009, 
<br>but have not been charged; Firtina publicly denied 
<br>involvement in any coup plots.  According to press accounts, 
<br>General Ozkok acknowledged during testimony to Ergenekon 
<br>prosecutors in April 2009 that most of the contents of the 
<br>"coup diaries" were true and that he was aware of plans to 
<br>overthrow the government among elements within the military 
<br>but did not have hard evidence to move against the plotters. 
<br> 
<br>"KAFES" (OPERATION CAGE) 
<br>------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (SBU) This plot involved senior navy flag officers and 
<br>was uncovered during the April 2009 search of the home of 
<br>retired Navy Lieutenant Commander Levent Bektas, an Ergenekon 
<br>suspect, and was revealed by Taraf in November 2009.  CDs 
<br>found in Bektas's home reportedly revealed a plot drafted in 
<br>March 2009 headed by then-Sea Area North Commander Vice 
<br>Admiral Feyyaz Ogutcu (now retired) and current Sea Area 
<br>South Commander Kadir Sardic.  The plot included plans to 
<br>assassinate prominent non-Muslim figures and blame these 
<br>attacks on the AKP in order to increase foreign and domestic 
<br>pressure for the AKP to step down.  Media reports indicated 
<br>that the plan included setting off a bomb planted at the 
<br>submarine exhibit at the Rahmi Koc Museum in Istanbul and 
<br>using women to obtain information from other navy officers 
<br>and entrap them into supporting Ergenekon.  Bektas has been 
<br>under arrest as part of the Ergenekon probe, as well as 
<br>several active duty officers, including Lt. Col. Halil 
<br>Ozsarac, and colonels Levent Gulmen and Mucahit Erakyol. 
<br>Thus far, neither Ogutcu or Sardic has been questioned about 
<br>this plot. 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (SBU) Taraf reporter Mehmet Baransu, who broke the news 
<br>about "Kafes," received an award from the Turkish Journalists 
<br>Association for his "Kafes" reporting, but was also 
<br>investigated for violating the confidentiality of an ongoing 
<br>criminal investigation.  While those charges have been 
<br>dropped, there is an ongoing case against Baransu and Taraf 
<br>manager Adnan Demir for "openly insulting the military 
<br>institution of the state," in violation of Section 301 of the 
<br>Turkish Penal Code. 
<br> 
<br>ACTION PLAN AGAINST FUNDAMENTALISM (refs d and e) 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (SBU) Photocopies of the alleged "Action Plan Against 
<br>Fundamentalism" were published by Taraf as a front-page story 
<br>in June 2009.  The plan outlined a psychological operations 
<br>campaign to discredit the ruling Justice and Development 
<br>Party (AKP) as well as other "sources of fundamentalism," 
<br>including the Fetullah Gulen movement.  The action plan was 
<br>allegedly drafted by Naval Infantry Colonel Dursun Cicek in 
<br>2009 under orders of then-Deputy CHOD Igsiz, with the 
<br>knowledge and tacit approval of General Basbug himself.  The 
<br>TGS denied the existence of such a plan, with General Basbug 
<br>dismissing the photocopied documents as "a piece of paper." 
<br>The allegation came roaring back to life in November 2009 
<br>when Taraf claimed that it had received -- from an anonymous 
<br>military officer -- the original copy of the plan with 
<br>Cicek's "wet" signature.  Cicek was detained in July 2009 for 
<br>his role in drafting the plan, but was released due to lack 
<br>of evidence.  He was again detained and interviewed by 
<br> 
<br>ANKARA 00000150  004 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>prosecutors in November 2009, but was again released without 
<br>charges. 
<br> 
<br>ASSASSINATION PLOT AGAINST DEPUTY PM (ref f) 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (SBU) On December 19, two active duty Turkish special 
<br>forces officers were arrested by the police near the 
<br>residence of Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc.  This led to 
<br>allegations that the military was planning to assassinate 
<br>Arinc.  As a result, the civilian judiciary issued a court 
<br>order to search the offices of the officers which are located 
<br>at the TGS Special Forces Mobilization Command.  After 
<br>initial refusal by the military to allow a broader search of 
<br>the premises, CHOD Basbug, along with Land Forces Commander 
<br>(and likely successor to Basbug as CHOD in August 2010) 
<br>General Kosaner, met with PM Erdogan on December 26. 
<br>Following this meeting, a second search warrant was issued to 
<br>allow a judge to review the classified documents stored at 
<br>the Mobilization Command headquarters.  These searches are 
<br>ongoing, but to date, the investigators have not announced 
<br>any discovery of evidence that would support the claims of an 
<br>assassination plot against Arinc. 
<br> 
<br>"BALYOZ" (SLEDGEHAMMER) (ref a) 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶14. (SBU) "Sledgehammer," the latest alleged plot, was 
<br>allegedly drafted in 2003 by the Turkish First Army, under 
<br>its then-commander Gen. Cetin Dogan.  The plan, which has 
<br>been denied by both the military and retired General Dogan, 
<br>involved false-flag bombing of mosques and efforts to provoke 
<br>a military crisis with Greece in order to create the 
<br>conditions for a military intervention.  The plan, as 
<br>revealed by "Taraf" on January 20 -- a day before the 
<br>Constitutional Court's decision overturning the law allowing 
<br>civilian jurisdiction over certain offenses committed by the 
<br>military -- allegedly included lists of names of politicians 
<br>and journalists to be arrested, as well as names of 
<br>politicians who would serve in a new government after the 
<br>removal of the AKP.
