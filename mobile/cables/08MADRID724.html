<br>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR'S MEETING WITH MINISTER OF CULTURE
<br>
<br>¶1. (U) Summary: Ambassador met with Minister of Culture Cesar
<br>Antonio Molina on 6/30/08. The minister told the Ambassador
<br>that he was willing to meet with the claimant or his
<br>representative in a Nazi art loot case. The minister
<br>emphasized he was willing to continue to fight intellectual
<br>property rights (IPR) piracy. He was also clearly following
<br>the Odyssey case closely and made it clear that the GOS would
<br>exercise all of its legal options. The minister discussed
<br>cultural cooperation with the U.S. as well. End Summary
<br>
<br>PARTICIPANTS
<br>------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) The minister was accompanied by Cultural Industries
<br>Policy Director General Guillermo Corral van Damme. The
<br>Ambassador was accompanied by EconOff.
<br>
<br>CASSIRER CLAIM
<br>--------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (U) The Ambassador stressed the USG's interest in direct
<br>discussions between the Spanish government and Claude
<br>Cassirer, the AmCit claimant of a painting by Camille Pisarro
<br>("Rue St. Honore") in the Thyssen Museum. The Ambassador
<br>noted also that while the Odyssey and Cassirer claim were on
<br>separate legal tracks, it was in both governments' interest
<br>to avail themselves of whatever margin for manuever they had,
<br>consistent with their legal obligations, to resolve both
<br>matters in a way that favored the bilateral relationship.
<br>The minister listened carefully to the Ambassador's message,
<br>but he put the accent on the separateness of the issues.
<br>Molina said that no Spanish government could return the
<br>painting (if this is what the claimant wants). To begin
<br>with, while the minister presides over the board that manages
<br>the Thyssen Museum's collection, the minister could not
<br>oblige the board to return the painting without a (Spanish)
<br>legal judgment. The minister added that paying compensation,
<br>as the British government has reportedly done in a number of
<br>cases, also posed legal problems. Director General van Damme
<br>said, however, that perhaps the Spanish government had
<br>"sinned" (pecado) in not meeting with the claimant or his
<br>representative. The minister said that he was willing to
<br>meet with the claimant or his representative in connection
<br>with a trip to Washington, D.C. in September or October this
<br>year.
<br>
<br>IPR
<br>---
<br>
<br>¶4. (U) The minister emphasized that he remains committed to
<br>fighting piracy. He said that on July 10, he would preside
<br>over the Spanish government's inter-ministerial anti-piracy
<br>coordinating body. Van Damme said that this meeting would
<br>serve to "relaunch efforts" to fight piracy. The Ambassador
<br>noted that the USG had waited a number of years to place
<br>Spain on the Special 301 Watch List, but that this year,
<br>continued alarming internet piracy levels had precipitated
<br>the Watch List decision. Having said that, the Ambassador
<br>also praised recent vigorous enforcement actions, for
<br>instance the arrests of 32 suspected Chinese DVD and CD
<br>pirates. The Ambassador noted that the subsequent press
<br>conference, in which the minister said that Spaniards should
<br>not buy pirated products because such products harmed
<br>culture, was especially significant. Both the minister and
<br>director general emphasized the importance of the internet.
<br>Van Damme said it was especially important to create
<br>attractive business models for selling content on-line. The
<br>Ambassador suggested that the minister meet with IPR and
<br>internet service provider representatives when he travels to
<br>Washington this fall, and he agreed to do so.
<br>
<br>ODYSSEY
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶5. (U) The minister explained that one of the reasons for his
<br>September or October Washington trip was to meet with the law
<br>firm the Spanish government has retained in the Odyssey case.
<br>The minister added that he was following the court
<br>proceedings in Tampa, Florida closely. He expressed
<br>indignation at a recent CNN interview of Odyssey CEO Greg
<br>Stemm who indicated that he would be willing to keep the gold
<br>coins found at the salvage site and return items of purely
<br>archeological interest. The Ambassador explained that the
<br>USG was cognizant of its international law responsibilities
<br>in these kinds of salvage cases and that American government
<br>lawyers would study carefully the legal implications and
<br>obligations arising from the Tampa court's decisions.
<br>
<br>CULTURAL COOPERATION
<br>--------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (U) The minister and the director general expressed great
<br>enthusiasm for cultural cooperation with the U.S. in general
<br>and Washington, D.C. in particular. With respect to
<br>Washington, for instance, the minister talked about Spanish
<br>support for an exhibition of 1970s and 80s art. He also
<br>talked about a more ambitious project, a "museum of "Latin"
<br>art (not clear where this would be, but he did talk about a
<br>"museum", not just a one-off exhibit). This would be separate
<br>from Ambassador Westendorp's (Spain's ambassador to the U.S.)
<br>idea of using the former Spanish Ambassador's residence in
<br>the Washington for some form of cultural repository.
<br>
<br>COMMENT
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶7. (U) The minister's expressed willingness to meet with
<br>Claude Cassirer or his representative is a modest step
<br>forward. We will remind the minister of this commitment whem
<br>he finalizes his Washington travel plans. With respect to
<br>IPR, we think the minister is sincere in his desire to combat
<br>piracy. Our challenge as an Embassy is to find ways to
<br>convince the GOS and stakeholders (especially the ISPs) that
<br>action against internet piracy cannot be held hostage to the
<br>mantra that "new business models" are required in this area.
<br>They certainly are necessary and desirable (both for ISPs and
<br>content providers). However, action against piracy may, in
<br>some cases, be necessary to make those models feasible.
