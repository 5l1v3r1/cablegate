<br>1.4 (b) and (d)
<br>
<br>DFM Leon Agrees that Bono's Comments Were Unhelpful
<br>
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Deputy Foreign Minister Bernardino Leon told DCM
<br>Manzanares Oct. 14 that he agreed that DefMin Bono's comments
<br>last week about US-Spain relations and the US role in the
<br>Spanish National Day Parade were extremely unhelpful. Leon
<br>promised there would be no further comments from President
<br>Zapatero that could be construed as anti-American, but that
<br>Bono was hard to control (note: Bono is a skilled politician
<br>who loves publicity and is known for his long-winded public
<br>comments). Leon said, however, that the Ambassador's
<br>non-attendance at the King's National Day reception --
<br>however taken out of context by the press -- had struck a
<br>difficult chord in the government.
<br>
<br>DCM Confirms Ambassador Had No Intention of Snubbing the King
<br>
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Manzanares responded that the Ambassador had no
<br>intention to snub the King or the Spanish people, and had in
<br>fact spoken with the King who was understanding of the
<br>Ambassador's difficulty in attending the reception as well as
<br>the Ambassador's prior decision, known to the GOS, not to
<br>attend the National Day parade. Manzanares told Leon that
<br>comments from senior government officials that put the issue
<br>in the most negative light possible were very unhelpful, and
<br>reached Washington just as fast as they reached the press in
<br>Madrid. Manzanares said the perception both in Madrid and
<br>Washington is that the current government exhibits very
<br>strong anti-Americanism, though we do not think that it is
<br>the intent of the government to portray itself in this way.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Leon said that there exists in Spain not so much
<br>anti-Americanism per se, but a broad anti-Bush administration
<br>sentiment, focused not on personalities but on policy.
<br>Manzanares asked Leon how the Zapatero government planned to
<br>put itself right with either a new Bush administration or a
<br>Kerry administration, noting that democracies need to come to
<br>terms with one another no matter which government was in
<br>power.
<br>
<br>U.S. Policies Post-Election
<br>
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Manzanares noted that even if another party wins the
<br>U.S. election, most of our foreign policy challenges - Iraq,
<br>Iran, counter-terrorism, etc. will remain the same, so that
<br>the Spanish government needs to come to terms with this and
<br>find ways to put the relationship back on track. Leon said
<br>that the U.S. should look at Spain's actions more than recent
<br>words. For example, Leon said that Spain sent over 1000
<br>troops to Afghanistan -- a large deployment for Spain -- as a
<br>sign of goodwill toward the U.S. Manzanares replied that we
<br>very much appreciated Spain's participation in Afghanistan,
<br>but there need to be more signals. Leon promised there would
<br>be other such signs. Manzanares noted that the U.S. was not
<br>concerned about Spain's desire to move toward what Spain saw
<br>as the "heart of Europe." The U.S. believes Europeans can
<br>remain close to the U.S. as well as their European
<br>counterparts.
<br>
<br>Leon Offers to Publicly Stress U.S.-Spain Cooperation
<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) What we object to, Manzanares continued, is being
<br>the "political football" Spain uses as it seeks to reinforce
<br>its European policy. "Anti-Americanism is not a foreign
<br>policy, " Manzanares said. Leon agreed, and asked if it
<br>would be helpful if he would draft a public statement (or
<br>op/ed) highlighting the importance of U.S.-Spanish
<br>cooperation. Manzanares said that would be very helpful and
<br>would welcome the idea of such a piece by the Spanish
<br>government.
<br>
<br>U.S. Has Been Patient
<br>
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Reviewing relations since the March 14 elections,
<br>Manzanares underscored that the US had been very patient and
<br>mature these last few months. The U.S. has refrained from
<br>responding to aggressive anti-US rhetoric as we looked for
<br>the new government to settle in, become more experienced and
<br>as we ourselves focused on our longer-term interests in
<br>Spain. Continued anti-U.S. rhetoric from high GOS levels,
<br>however, was forcing us to reconsider this restraint and
<br>respond more aggressively. Leon said he understood and hoped
<br>that this would not be necessary. Returning to the theme of
<br>Zapatero's comments, such as those in Tunis several weeks
<br>ago, Manzanares asked Leon why Zapatero had not taken the
<br>opportunity to retract his statements after Secretary Powell
<br>had spoken to FM Moratinos. Leon said that Zapatero had not
<br>intended the remarks the way they were taken and pointed to
<br>comments Zapatero had made in Bilbao the following day as
<br>being pro-American. Manzanares pointed out that we had not
<br>seen these comments in Bilbao and they were not highlighted
<br>in the press here.
<br>
<br>Other issues:
<br>
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Cuba: Leon said the GOS did not want a wholesale
<br>change in the EU policy toward Cuba, but rather to modify it
<br>somewhat to allow EU Ambassadors and diplomats access to
<br>Castro and other Cuban officials in order to press home the
<br>need for reform. Leon underscored there were no personal
<br>relations with Castro among members of the Socialist
<br>government in the way that existed during the previous
<br>Socialist government under Felipe Gonzalez. Leon said if the
<br>other Europeans did not agree with Spain on the Cuba issue,
<br>Spain would not adopt a unilateral policy.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Western Sahara: Leon noted the excellent meeting he
<br>had had with A/S Burns several weeks ago in which they
<br>discussed Western Sahara. He said that Spanish and U.S.
<br>positions were relatively the same, and pointed to the French
<br>position -- embodied by Chirac himself -- as being the
<br>problem in finding a way forward. Leon characterized
<br>Chirac's position in support of Rabat as "stronger than that
<br>of the King of Morocco." He pledged to continue to work with
<br>the USG on the issue.
