<br>REF: LA PAZ 1498 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Amb. Philip S. Goldberg for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: WHA A/S Shannon, accompanied by INL PDAS 
<br>McGlynn, the Ambassador, DCM, and Emboff, met at 5 a.m. on 
<br>July 23 with Bolivian President Evo Morales, who was 
<br>accompanied by Foreign Minister David Choquehuanca, Minister 
<br>of Government Alfredo Rada, Presidential Spokesman Ivan 
<br>Canelas, and Bolivian Ambassador to the U.S. Mario Gustavo 
<br>Guzman. Morales expressed his regret for the June 9 march on 
<br>the Embassy and its aftermath and acknowledged that Bolivia 
<br>"needs" the U.S. However, he also cited "proofs" of a USG 
<br>conspiracy against him and his government. Assuring Morales 
<br>that there was no USG conspiracy against him, A/S Shannon 
<br>agreed that the two countries should work together to build a 
<br>climate of confidence, using bilateral consultations as a 
<br>mechanism to achieve this end. After the Morales meeting A/S 
<br>Shannon and delegation held meetings with Bolivian Senate 
<br>President Oscar Ortiz and President of the Congress Edmundo 
<br>Novillo. End summary. 
<br>
<br>EVO FEARS A CONSPIRACY 
<br>---------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) President Morales opened the meeting by saying he 
<br>viewed this as a chance to improve relations with the USG. 
<br>Evo said he wanted to be "sincere" and to say up front "I do 
<br>not believe in the capitalist system." He remarked that his 
<br>government is one of dialogue and then went on to talk 
<br>about his belief that the United States was conspiring 
<br>against his government. Morales complained that "since the 
<br>90s the Department of State has described me as a 
<br>narco-trafficker as a narco mafia, and I have been called the 
<br>Andean Bin Laden" by former Ambassador Rocha. He then cited 
<br>a litany of events that he argued proved the hostile intent 
<br>of the United States. Morales also expressed concern about 
<br>how USAID's resources are spent. Morales said he had been 
<br>told that USAID offers money to Movement Toward Socialism 
<br>(MAS) mayors for them to switch to opposition party Podemos. 
<br>According to Morales, "Bolivian employees of USAID go 
<br>door-to-door in northern Potosi telling people if they get 
<br>rid of Evo the economy is going to get better." Evo said 
<br>that one mayor told him that USAID offered him $15,000 to 
<br>$25,000 dollars to oppose Evo. Evo closed his opening 
<br>remarks by saying "currently there is a conspiracy led by the 
<br>U.S. Embassy against my security, against my government. 
<br>
<br>A/S SHANNON RESPONDS 
<br>-------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) A/S Shannon said that the United States was 
<br>committed to the success of Bolivian democracy and the 
<br>Bolivian people and had no interest that would justify a 
<br>conspiracy against the Morales government. He noted that he 
<br>had no interest in receiving Morales, list of supposed 
<br>conspiratorial behavior, but rather would like to point out 
<br>how the USG has been trying to work with the Morales 
<br>administration. Shannon mentioned President Bush's 
<br>congratulatory phone call after Morales' election and the 
<br>meeting held with Secretary Rice. The A/S highlighted how 
<br>the USG has modified its anti-narcotics tactics to work with 
<br>the GOB, re-certified the GOB, and extended ATPDA benefits. 
<br>He also noted that the USG had worked with multilateral 
<br>development banks to forgive $1 billion in loans owed by 
<br>Bolivia. Shannon told Morales that "we have no interest in 
<br>creating conflicts or political chaos in Bolivia. Our 
<br>Ambassador and officers will meet with various groups, but it 
<br>is not to conspire against you." Shannon said that Bolivia 
<br>
<br>LA PAZ 00001667 002 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>and the United States are in a "critical moment in our 
<br>relationship" and that he wanted security guarantees for 
<br>USAID and the Peace Corps so as "to be able to continue with 
<br>these programs." 
<br>
<br>STOP THE CONSPIRACY AND GIVE US THE CASH 
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) President Morales responded that "if the conspiracy 
<br>stops then we can begin a new relationship based on our 
<br>proposed agenda." Evo said that "only 20% to 30% of USAID 
<br>money reaches the people, why don't you support the 'Bolivia 
<br>Cambia, Evo Cumple' (Bolivia Changes, Evo Delivers) program 
<br>instead?" Evo insisted that the Venezuelan-supported program 
<br>is "sound and transparent" and that USAID should redirect its 
<br>money there. The president brought up ATPDA and asked for a 
<br>five year extension and an eventual "just and beneficial" 
<br>long term trade deal. With regard to Millennium Challenge 
<br>Account (MCC), Evo asked the A/S "to just tell me the truth" 
<br>about the political decision to freeze the program. Morales 
<br>said that Brazil and Hugo Chavez are allies that will help 
<br>with the road projects but that he hasn't given up hope on 
<br>MCC. 
<br>
<br>DRUGS, USAID, AND THE CHAPARE 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Morales complained that people are trying to link 
<br>his government to the FARC and that his government is not 
<br>being noticed for its respect for human rights. Evo told 
<br>Shannon, "I recognize that in the Yungas there has been an 
<br>increase in coca production. For political reasons there is 
<br>not much we can do." Morales also said that he regrets the 
<br>amount of drugs leaving the country. He criticized 
<br>USAID's involvement in the Chapare, saying that USAID set up 
<br>parallel organizations to the coca unions and that it works 
<br>with local mayors against the coca federation. The president 
<br>says that he receives letters "from all over the country 
<br>asking me to remove USAID." 
<br>
<br>AMERICAN JUSTICE 
<br>---------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Evo said that people speak well of the American 
<br>justice system so therefore he "cannot believe that you would 
<br>have those two delinquents (Sanchez de Lozada and Sanchez 
<br>Berzain) there. "People are upset, you should expel them. I 
<br>tell you this, send back Goni and you will become the mayor 
<br>of El Alto." 
<br>
<br>CHOQUEHUANCA SPEAKS 
<br>------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Foreign Minister Choquehuanca said "we want to 
<br>reestablish confidence. We want American cooperation to be 
<br>strictly economic and to be part of the 'Bolivia Cambia, Evo 
<br>Cumple' program." Choquehuanca said the GOB was finishing 
<br>the Sanchez de Lozada (Goni) extradition request and that it 
<br>should be ready by August. He asked that Bolivia be 
<br>re-certified and that "our efforts be recognized, especially 
<br>our respect for human rights." The Foreign Minister 
<br>mentioned establishing exchange programs because the current 
<br>USG programs "are not transparent and we are suspicious when 
<br>scholarship students are asked to spy on us." 
<br>
<br>LET'S START ANEW 
<br>---------------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) A/S Shannon ended the meeting by saying that we 
<br>
<br>LA PAZ 00001667 003 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>would study the GOB's proposed agenda and add our own points. 
<br>He suggested that subsequently dates for bilateral 
<br>consultations could be established. Evo said that his friend 
<br>President Lula gave him some good advice, "have lots of 
<br>patience. If you tell me to separate out the conspiracies 
<br>than that's what we will do. We will not break relations. 
<br>We will continue to put up with and bear these things. I 
<br>regret that my brothers and sisters from El Alto went down to 
<br>the Embassy (to try and break into the compound on June 9) 
<br>and I recognize that my country needs you." 
<br>
<br>SENATE PRESIDENT OSCAR ORTIZ 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Immediately following the Morales meeting A/S 
<br>Shannon and delegation met with Senate President Oscar Ortiz 
<br>(Podemos - Santa Cruz). Ortiz stressed the importance of the 
<br>senate being "one of the only institutions not in the hands 
<br>of the MAS." He told Shannon that "democracy is under heavy 
<br>attack" and that time is passing by quickly. The August 10 
<br>revoking referendum "will only ratify the deep divisions in 
<br>the country and Evo will lose in five departments." The 
<br>senator expressed concern about "overt" Venezuelan influence 
<br>and the possibility of voter registration fraud. He 
<br>chastised the OAS for "coming here last week and making 
<br>irresponsible declarations regarding voter registration 
<br>records." Ortiz predicted that "eventually the economic 
<br>crisis in the country will overtake any political crisis." 
<br>When asked about dialogue to find a solution to the current 
<br>political crisis Ortiz responded that the opposition wanted a 
<br>solution through dialogue and that he had spoken to Vice 
<br>President Garcia Linera about this. "However," Ortiz said, 
<br>"it takes two to tango." He hopes the "friends of Bolivia" 
<br>would be expanded to include the European Union and lamented 
<br>the increase in drug trafficking and the fact that "the 
<br>Brazilians and the European Union tolerate it." 
<br>
<br>PRESIDENT OF THE CONGRESS EDMUNDO NOVILLO 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) A/S Shannon also met with the President of the 
<br>Congress Edmundo Novillo (MAS - Cochabamba). Novillo said 
<br>that the August 10 referendum "will not solve the political 
<br>crisis" and that the people do not understand what it is 
<br>because "a revoking referendum is something new for the 
<br>country." He admitted that "this process of change has 
<br>generated uncertainty." When asked what role the congress 
<br>could play in resolving the crisis Novillo was pessimistic, 
<br>saying that "the polarization is strong, too strong, within 
<br>the congress." Regarding Bolivia - U.S. relations Novillo 
<br>said he thought it is a good time to reevaluate all aspects 
<br>of the relationship with an eye toward common interests. He 
<br>said the U.S. should realize "there are suspicions within the 
<br>government and within the population because the 
<br>relationships with past governments." Novillo said that 
<br>anti-narcotics cooperation "is a difficult topic" and that it 
<br>is necessary to have a mutually agreed upon agenda. He 
<br>recognized that USAID's alternative development programs have 
<br>had "a certain amount of success" but that the money could 
<br>and should be better invested. 
<br>
