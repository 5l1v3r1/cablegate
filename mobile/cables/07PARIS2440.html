<br>SUBJECT: FRENCH MFA OFFICIAL SHARES VIEWS ON IRAN/IRAQ 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>CLASSIFIED BY: POLITICAL MINISTER-COUNSELOR JOSIAH ROSENBLATT, 
<br>REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: FRANCK GELLET, FRENCH DAS-EQUIVALENT FOR THE 
<br>PAGE 02 RUEHFRA2440 C O N F I D E N T I A L PARIS 002440 
<br>PERSIAN GULF, SHARED HIS VIEWS ON IRAN AND IRAQ ON JUNE 7. 
<br>GELLET ASSESSED THAT THE IRANIANS ARE OVERCONFIDENT AND 
<br>VULNERABLE TO A BAN ON INTERNATIONAL AIR TRAVEL.  HIS 
<br>ASSESSMENT OF IRAQ WAS NOTABLY BLEAK.  END SUMMARY. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) OVER LUNCH JUNE 7, THE MFAS DAS-EQUIVALENT FOR THE 
<br>PERSIAN GULF, FRANCK GELLET, SHARED HIS VIEWS ON IRAN AND 
<br>IRAQ.  HAVING RECENTLY RETURNED FROM A 15-DAY TRIP TO IRAN, 
<br>GELLET SAID THAT HIS MOST SERIOUS AND USEFUL INTERLOCUTOR WAS 
<br>FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER VELAYATI, WHOM HE DESCRIBED AS BEING 
<br>"LESS ROMANTIC" THAN THE REGIME'S OTHER FOREIGN POLICY 
<br>HEAVYWEIGHTS.  GELLET SAID THAT VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE IRANIAN 
<br>OFFICIALS HE MET OVERESTIMATED THE REGIME'S STRENGTH, BOTH ON 
<br>THE REGIONAL AND THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE.  "THE IRANIANS ARE 
<br>CONVINCED THAT NO ONE -- INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES -- CAN 
<br>TOUCH THEM ECONOMICALLY OR MILITARILY.  THEY SIMPLY CAN'T 
<br>IMAGINE THAT THE U.S. HAS THE CAPACITY AND THE POLITICAL WILL 
<br>TO LAUNCH A MILITARY STRIKE AGAINST THEM AT A TIME WHEN THE 
<br>U.S. MILITARY APPEARS TO BE BOGGED DOWN IN IRAQ," SAID 
<br>GELLET.

<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) GELLET SAID HIS OWN VIEW (WHICH, HE CAUTIONED, IS NOT 
<br>SHARED BY EVERYONE AT THE MFA), IS THAT IF THE EUROPEANS 
<br>REALLY WANT TO AVOID A MILITARY CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE 
<br>U.S. AND IRAN THEN THEY NEED TO SHOW THE IRANIANS THEY ARE 
<br>SERIOUS ABOUT ECONOMIC SANCTIONS.  "THE IRANIANS WILL NEVER 
<br>BLINK UNTIL THEY FEEL THAT THE REGIME'S SURVIVAL IS AT 
<br>STAKE," SAID GELLET.  HE SUGGESTED THAT -- IN ADDITION TO A 
<br>FURTHER SANCTIONS ON THE BANKING SECTOR, A FULL ARMS EMBARGO, 
<br>AND A CUT IN EXPORT CREDITS -- THE IRANIANS MIGHT BE 
<br>VULNERABLE TO AN EMBARGO OF REFINED PETROLEUM PRODUCTS.  IN 
<br>ADDITION, HE SUGGESTED THAT WE NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE DRAMATIC 
<br>ISOLATING EFFECT THAT A BAN ON INTERNATIONAL AIR TRAVEL TO 
<br>AND FROM IRAN WOULD HAVE.  GELLET NOTED THAT THESE WERE JUST 
<br>HIS PERSONAL VIEWS, AND SAID THAT HE HAS NOT YET RECEIVED ANY 
<br>GUIDANCE FROM THE NEW PRESIDENCY ON IRAN SANCTIONS.  HE 
<br>OBSERVED THAT PRESIDENT SARKOZY TOOK A HARD LINE AGAINST THE 
<br>IRANIAN NUCLEAR PROGRAM DURING HIS ELECTION CAMPAIGN, BUT 
<br>SAID IT REMAINED TO BE SEEN WHAT THAT WOULD TRANSLATE INTO IN 
<br>POLICY TERMS.

<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) GELLET, WHO SERVED FOR NEARLY THREE YEARS AT THE 
<br>FRENCH EMBASSY IN BAGHDAD BEFORE ASSUMING HIS CURRENT 
<br>POSITION, HAD A PARTICULARLY GRIM VIEW OF IRAQ.  "WE DON'T 
<br>HAVE THE SLIGHTEST HOPE IT CAN BE SALVAGED -- IT'S LOST," HE 
<br>SAID.  HE PREDICTED THAT IRAQ WILL DESCEND INTO FULL-SCALE 
<br>CIVIL WAR WHETHER OR NOT MNF-I REMAINS.  ON THE OTHER HAND, 
<br>HE PREDICTED THAT IF THE COALITION WERE TO WITHDRAW THERE 
<br>WOULD BE AN IMMEDIATE AND HORRIFIC SPIKE IN THE LEVEL OF 
<br>VIOLENCE.  "YOUR DEPARTURE WOULD BE SEEN EVERYWHERE AS A SIGN 
<br>THAT IT'S TIME FOR THE GLOVES TO COME OFF," HE SAID.  HE 
<br>FURTHER PREDICTED THAT, IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE COALITION'S 
<br>DEPARTURE (WHENEVER THAT OCCURS), THE ENSUING CONFLICT WOULD 
<br>LAST MANY YEARS UNTIL IRAQ'S SUNNIS AND SHIITES (AND THEIR 
<br>RESPECTIVE PATRONS) WERE EXHAUSTED.  AS FOR THE KURDS, GELLET 
<br>SAID THEY SERIOUSLY UNDERESTIMATED THE RISK THAT THEY WOULD 
<br>BE ANNIHILATED DURING THE COURSE OF A CIVIL WAR THAT WOULD 
<br>LIKELY PULL IN MOST OF IRAQ'S NEIGHBORS, INCLUDING TURKEY. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) NOTWITHSTANDING HIS BLEAK ANALYSIS, GELLET ENCOURAGED 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>PAGE 05 RUEHFRA2440 C O N F I D E N T I A L PARIS 002440 
<br>THE U.S. TO CONTINUE ITS EFFORTS TO PROMOTE RECONCILIATION. 
<br>HE NOTED THAT ONE COMPLAINT HE OFTEN HEARD FROM HIS SUNNI 
<br>CONTACTS WAS THAT THEY RECEIVED CONFLICTING MESSAGES FROM THE 
<br>VARIOUS USG AGENCIES ON THE GROUND IN IRAQ, AND WERE NEVER 
<br>SURE WHICH OF THEM HAD THE ULTIMATE DECISION-MAKING 
<br>AUTHORITY.  GELLET FINISHED BY WARNING THAT OUR TRIBAL ALLIES 
<br>IN ANBAR PROVINCE WOULD TURN ON US WHENEVER IT SUITED THEIR 
<br>INTERESTS TO DO SO.
