<br>
<br>Classified By: Minister-Counselor for Political Affairs Kirk Augustine. 
<br>Reasons: 1.4 (B/D). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY. Adding fuel to already intense speculation 
<br>about who will succeed him, President Putin confirmed to 
<br>state media May 13 that he will endorse a candidate before 
<br>the March 2008 election. Both Kremlin-connected and 
<br>independent analysts believe Putin's choice will be driven by 
<br>a desire to ensure his physical and financial security, to 
<br>maximize the likelihood of continuity in his policies, and to 
<br>preserve the current political system, in which he is the 
<br>final arbiter of disputes among rival groups (a role he 
<br>likely intends to play even after leaving office). Our 
<br>contacts generally think Putin will consult about possible 
<br>successors with his closest advisers but make the final 
<br>decision alone, without involving elites outside the Kremlin 
<br>or relying heavily on public opinion surveys, as former 
<br>President Boris Yeltsin did. The conventional wisdom remains 
<br>that First Deputy Prime Minister Dmitriy Medvedev and Deputy 
<br>Prime Minister/Defense Minister Sergey Ivanov are the two 
<br>front-runners, but other horses of varying shades of darkness 
<br>are believed to be at least potentially in the running. 
<br>Putin's interest lies in prolonging uncertainty to avoid a 
<br>premature slippage of power away from him and toward a 
<br>perceived successor, but that uncertainty encourages 
<br>competitive jockeying for position among the candidates and a 
<br>feeding-frenzy among those who fear their snouts could soon 
<br>be torn from the trough. END SUMMARY. 
<br>. 
<br>HELPING RUSSIA BY HELPING HIMSELF 
<br>--------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Most of our contacts take for granted that Putin's 
<br>own physical and financial security and social status 
<br>post-2008 loom large in his succession calculations. 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX told us that financial 
<br>considerations would drive Putin's thinking. 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX  agreed, describing  the Russian
<br>presidency as a business and saying that Putin's  decision
<br>on a successor would be based on his sense of who  would
<br>best be able to protect the wealth he and his  associates
<br>had acquired. Equally important to Putin,  according to
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX, is preserving the elite-based political
<br>system in which ad hoc interest groups vie for political
<br>clout and  control over economic resources, with Putin as the
<br>ultimate  arbiter. XXXXXXXXXXXX said Putin feared the
<br>system would  collapse without him at its center, and therefore
<br>intended to remain active behind the scenes while leaving
<br>day-to-day  governance to his successor. XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>agreed, saying that preserving the current balance of power
<br>among competing elite  groups was of great importance to Putin. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX  told us that Putin needs to choose a 
<br>strong successor who is not beholden to any one group and who 
<br>has already amassed a personal fortune during Putin's tenure. 
<br>Such a figure, XXXXXXXXXXXX explained, would have a vested 
<br>interest in maintaining the status quo in order to protect 
<br>his own wealth and standing. XXXXXXXXXXXX disagreed,
<br>arguing  that a strong successor would inevitably side with
<br>one group  or another, and succumb to the temptation to crush
<br>his  rivals. Such a turn of events would not only disrupt the 
<br>precarious balance of clans and lead to a redistribution of 
<br>assets, but also undermine Putin's role as arbiter of the 
<br>competing groups. XXXXXXXXXXXX offered another 
<br>perspective, saying that a succession candidate's "strength" 
<br>or "weakness" would be of only secondary interest to Putin; 
<br>the overriding criterion would be loyalty to Putin personally. 
<br>. 
<br>PUTIN LISTENING, BUT WILL DECIDE ALONE 
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Many of our contacts believe that, having weakened 
<br>all his potential rivals and atomized the elite, Putin will 
<br>be able to make the choice of his successor alone, without 
<br>needing to consult extensively with political and economic 
<br>elites to ensure their support. XXXXXXXXXXXX expects
<br>Putin to discuss the issue informally with his closest advisers,
<br>but to reveal his final decision to them only shortly before
<br>going public, in order to maintain strict secrecy. The broader
<br>elite and the general public would learn of Putin's decision 
<br>simultaneously. XXXXXXXXXXXX concurred, saying Putin
<br>would consult only a handful of close advisers, including
<br>Medvedev,  Sergey Ivanov, and Deputy PA head Igor Sechin.
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX  expected that on questions of succession,
<br>Sechin's opinion  would carry more weight than Medvedev's or
<br>Ivanov's, because  Putin would consider that as possible
<br>successors, the latter  two could not give disinterested advice. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Asked whether Putin, by not consulting more broadly, 
<br>would not risk alienating those whose financial resources and 
<br>media outlets would be central to ensuring a smooth 
<br>succession, XXXXXXXXXXXX predicted that the elites, on
<br>hearing  the name of Putin's preferred successor, would fight
<br>each  other to be first to pledge allegiance to his choice. If 
<br>elite opinion mattered to Putin, XXXXXXXXXXXX added
<br>pointedly,  former Yukos CEO Mikhail Khodorkovskiy would
<br>still be free.  Instead, XXXXXXXXXXXX said, Putin was confident
<br>elites have  learned from the Khodorkovskiy case the severe 
<br>consequences  of defying the Kremlin. XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>agreed, saying that despite  real divisions within the elite, there
<br>remains a profound  corporate interest in maintaining the existing
<br>contours of political and economic power, and that can best be
<br>done by  falling in line behind Putin's choice, whoever it may be. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Given how extensively former President Yeltsin's team 
<br>used public opinion polls to identify an electable successor, 
<br>many have assumed Putin would do the same.
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX, however, told us the Kremlin would 
<br>not poll to determine what  qualities the public wants to see in
<br>Russia's next president,  since the results would be meaningless:
<br>respondents in such a  poll would simply describe Putin when
<br>asked what their ideal  president would be like -- reversing the
<br>pattern from 1999, when respondents listed as desirable qualities
<br>those that the deeply unpopular Yeltsin lacked
<br> XXXXXXXXXXXX also argued that the Kremlin's control over
<br>major media outlets would not be sufficient in itself to build a
<br>mass following for a  presidential candidate -- the key to
<br>winning public support  would be to find a way to "resonate
<br>with the public," as  Putin did when he gave an emotional speech
<br>in September 1999 in response to a series of apartment bombings
<br>that had  terrorized the population. Until that point,
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX said,  even daily television coverage had
<br>only modestly improved  Putin's popularity rating. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXX disagreed,
<br>arguing that the  Kremlin has sufficient administrative and media
<br>resources to  ensure that the public votes "correctly" in 2008.
<br>Taking a  different tack, XXXXXXXXXXXX told us public opinion
<br>could be an  important variable if the electorate were actively engaged, 
<br>but he did not expect it to be mobilized for this election. 
<br>Voters -- like the elites -- would primarily be interested, 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX thought, in maintaining the higher standard of
<br>living  they have attained under Putin, and would see Putin's chosen 
<br>successor as the best available insurance policy. 
<br>
<br>FIVE WHO ARE THOUGHT TO BE ALIVE 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Upwards of thirty names have appeared in the Russian 
<br>press as possible successors to Putin, but XXXXXXXXXXXX 
<br>told us she believes Putin has now narrowed the field to 
<br>five: First Deputy Prime Minister Dmitriy Medvedev, Deputy 
<br>Prime Minister/Defense Minister Sergey Ivanov, Presidential 
<br>Administration (PA) head Sergey Sobyanin, Russian Railways 
<br>CEO Vladimir Yakunin, and head of the Government apparatus 
<br>Sergey Naryshkin. Nearly all analysts see Medvedev and 
<br>Ivanov as the clear front-runners at this stage, and most of 
<br>our contacts describe Sobyanin, Yakunin, and Naryshkin as at 
<br>best "reserve" candidates. XXXXXXXXXXXX dismissed the theory
<br>that Putin was using Medvedev and Ivanov as "red herrings" to 
<br>distract attention from the "real," as yet unidentified, 
<br>successor, saying that Putin is serious about making Medvedev 
<br>or Ivanov Russia's next president. XXXXXXXXXXXX concurred,
<br>noting that Putin has nothing to gain by choosing a less-familiar 
<br>figure to succeed him. Those seeing the succession as a 
<br>two-horse race are divided as to whether Putin will endorse 
<br>Medvedev or Ivanov, with XXXXXXXXXXXX positing a
<br>"power-sharing"  scenario in which one would serve as president
<br>and the other  as prime minister. 
<br>
<br>Medvedev 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Medvedev's long-standing loyalty to Putin, his 
<br>administrative skills, his propensity for hard work, and his 
<br>potential to benefit if the "national projects" that he 
<br>supervises are successful are among his qualifications for 
<br>the presidency. XXXXXXXXXXXX told us that Medvedev would
<br>respect Putin's wishes and work to maintain the existing balance 
<br>among rival elite groups, which would make his selection 
<br>acceptable to all key power elements. XXXXXXXXXXXX also
<br>said  Medvedev's administrative skills were widely underestimated. 
<br>Citing his Kremlin contacts, XXXXXXXXXXXX said the PA had
<br>run more  efficiently under Medvedev than now under
<br>Sobyanin. XXXXXXXXXXXX,  who said Medvedev was his own
<br>choice for president, described  him as dedicated, hardworking,
<br>and skilled in management. (NOTE: In addition to his duties as
<br>First Deputy Prime Minister, Medvedev directs the implementation
<br>of the national projects, is chairman of the board of Gazprom, is
<br>responsible  for coordinating Russia's response to avian flu, and
<br>since mid-May has chaired a government commission on bringing 
<br>digital television to Russia. END NOTE.) 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Medvedev nonetheless has challenges to overcome. 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX told us Medvedev does not come across as 
<br>"presidential" on television or in public, although she noted 
<br>that he has nearly two years to strengthen his image. The 
<br>camp of PA Deputy Head Igor Sechin, which is still trying to 
<br>convince Putin to remain in office beyond 2008, poses another 
<br>challenge to Medvedev. XXXXXXXXXXXX said Sechin's camp
<br>is trying  to discredit both Medvedev and Ivanov in order to convince 
<br>Putin to seek a third term. According to XXXXXXXXXXXX,
<br>Medvedev lost a recent battle when Fradkov (who is allied with
<br>Sechin) was given control of the Customs Service, which had 
<br>previously been subordinated to Medvedev's frequent ally, 
<br>Minister of Economic Development and Trade German Gref. 
<br>
<br>Sergey Ivanov 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Ivanov has Putin's trust, is widely regarded as a 
<br>patriot and pragmatist, comes across as presidential, and has 
<br>proven politically resilient in the face of recurrent 
<br>criticism, including from within the military establishment. 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX said Ivanov is regarded as a more effective 
<br>administrator and bureaucratic player than Medvedev. 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX said Ivanov had demonstrated his ability to
<br>weather political attacks over the last year, as his popularity 
<br>rating had not been affected by the Sechin camp's efforts to 
<br>tarnish his image by exploiting cases of military hazing, 
<br>using the Main Military Prosecutor to highlight the high rate 
<br>of crime in the armed forces, and publicizing the fact that 
<br>Ivanov's son had run over and killed an elderly pedestrian. 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX told us that Putin's May 10 address to 
<br>the legislature gave Ivanov a boost by highlighting 
<br>improvements in military capability, innovation, and morale. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Our contacts note that Putin and others could 
<br>perceive some of Ivanov's strengths as weaknesses. For 
<br>instance, while many say that Ivanov is not corrupt (at least 
<br>in relative terms), some of Putin's close advisers reportedly 
<br>see that as a threat, since they do not know how to "do 
<br>business" with such a person. XXXXXXXXXXXX said Putin
<br>may also  see Ivanov's leadership skills as a potential threat to the 
<br>balance of forces among elites, and potentially to Putin's 
<br>own continued influence. 
<br>
<br>Yakunin 
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Putin probably considers Vladimir Yakunin's 
<br>long-standing friendship and business experience his best 
<br>qualifications for the presidency, according to our contacts. 
<br>Yakunin shares Putin's KGB background, and they first met in 
<br>the 1990s in St. Petersburg. Yakunin has thus far generally 
<br>avoided the public spotlight, and (according to a close 
<br>supporter) hopes Medvedev and Ivanov will fall short of 
<br>Putin's expectations in the run-up to 2008 (ref A). Our 
<br>contacts generally consider Yakunin a fallback candidate who 
<br>would probably remain loyal to Putin after taking office, but 
<br>could have difficulty forging ties with the political and 
<br>economic elites and the general public. XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>said  Yakunin was "too exotic and strange" to become president, 
<br>citing Yakunin's close and secretive relationship with the 
<br>hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church, his reported ties 
<br>to Fidel Castro and Lyndon Larouche, and his involvement in 
<br>organizations like the Center for the National Glory of 
<br>Russia. XXXXXXXXXXXX agreed, saying Yakunin was
<br>generally seen as  an "outsider" in the elite, notwithstanding
<br>his ties to Putin. 
<br>
<br>Sobyanin 
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) Sobyanin is thought by some to be a potential 
<br>successor because of his loyalty to Putin and apparent lack 
<br>of ambition. He recently visited London at Putin's 
<br>direction, providing the beginnings of an international 
<br>profile. In XXXXXXXXXXXX's view, Putin could feel
<br>confidentthat  Sobyanin, if elected, would continue to defer
<br>to him.  XXXXXXXXXXXX said Sobyanin's lack of ambition
<br>was one reasonPutin had felt comfortable bringing him into the
<br>PA. (Note. The  basis for the judgment by XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>and XXXXXXXXXXXX that Sobyanin lacks ambition, rather
<br>than has veiled ambition, is not clear. End Note) Among
<br>Sobyanin's liabilities, according to  XXXXXXXXXXXX, was that he
<br> I  "one-dimensional" and comfortable 
<br>only when dealing with regional affairs. XXXXXXXXXXXX noted
<br>that  Sobyanin lacks a public platform that would help him build 
<br>support among voters and, despite a good reputation as 
<br>governor of Tyumen, he was proving an ineffective manager in 
<br>the PA. XXXXXXXXXXXX told us Sobyanin had been charged with 
<br>overseeing the drafting of the annual state of the nation 
<br>address that Putin had presented May 10, but Putin had been 
<br>so dissatisfied with the early drafts that he took over the 
<br>speechwriting process himself. Others have painted 
<br>Sobyanin's role in the production of the speech in more 
<br>positive terms. XXXXXXXXXXXX thought Putin would not be 
<br>comfortable making Sobyanin president, given their relatively 
<br>brief connection. 
<br>
<br>Naryshkin 
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) Sergey Naryshkin's name has recently begun surfacing 
<br>with greater frequency in the media and in conversations with 
<br>our contacts (ref B), but he continues to be regarded as at 
<br>best a long-shot for president. XXXXXXXXXXXX said Naryshkin,
<br> who  worked with Putin in the KGB, is a junior partner to Fradkov, 
<br>who has used him to attack Gref and Minister of Finance 
<br>Aleksey Kudrin. XXXXXXXXXXXX said Naryshkin dutifully follows 
<br>instructions from Putin and Fradkov in the hope of becoming 
<br>Putin's successor, or at least to be Minister of Economic 
<br>Development and Trade in the next president's administration. 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX described Naryshkin as an "interesting" figure and 
<br>cautioned against underestimating his chances.
<br> XXXXXXXXXXXX agreed, saying that Naryshkin is a capable,
<br>detail-oriented  official whose loyalty to Putin is undisputed. 
<br>. 
<br>COMMENT 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX's list of five "live" candidates is 
<br>not, in our judgment, definitive. Given Putin's tendency to 
<br>make surprise personnel decisions and the unforeseeable 
<br>political issues that could arise before March 2008, other 
<br>potential successors may emerge. Moreover, although we 
<br>believe Putin does plan to leave office in 2008, that is at 
<br>most a present intention. If as 2008 approaches he is not 
<br>persuaded of the viability of any of the succession 
<br>candidates, particularly if it appears that Russia will face 
<br>difficult domestic or international circumstances, Putin 
<br>could still decide to remain in power, and would likely have 
<br>little trouble in arranging to do so. XXXXXXXXXXX
<br> told us  a third-term scenario was still on the table in the
<br>Kremlin, although only as a fall-back option. 
<br>
<br>¶17. (C) Our expectation, however, remains that Putin will 
<br>step out of the Presidency in 2008. We concur that, in 
<br>choosing the person he wants to succeed him, he will be 
<br>motivated to protect his wealth and security (e.g., from 
<br>prosecution) and to ensure his continuing political influence 
<br>and social status after leaving office. We believe he will 
<br>also reject any succession candidate who he suspects might 
<br>steer Russia away from his policy "legacy." Those factors 
<br>suggest he will choose a successor in whom he has a high 
<br>degree of personal and political trust and who he sees as at 
<br>least competent as an administrator and politician. We share 
<br>the judgment that he has a relatively free hand in his 
<br>choice, with the political class and broader public ready, at 
<br>least initially, to defer to his judgment within broad limits. 
<br>
<br>¶18. (C) Views differ on how involved Putin plans to be in 
<br>day-to-day governance after 2008. Unlike Yeltsin in 2000, 
<br>Putin will leave office at a relatively young age, in good 
<br>health and with very high public support. If he wants a 
<br>highly operational "behind-the-scenes" role, that could 
<br>incline him to opt for a successor whom he saw as easy to 
<br>control. If he envisions, on the other hand, a "stand-back" 
<br>post-2008 role in which he would engage only on strategic 
<br>issues (a la Deng Xiaoping, a model that our counterparts in 
<br>the Chinese Embassy claim to find germane), that could be 
<br>reflected in a choice of a more dynamic and capable successor 
<br>expected to act with substantial autonomy. Obviously, the 
<br>degree to which any successor -- having won popular election 
<br>and received at least the externalities of power -- would 
<br>long be content to administer day-to-day affairs while 
<br>allowing Putin to direct the real course of policy from 
<br>behind the scenes is open to question. 
<br>
<br>¶19. (C) We also agree that last fall's appointments of 
<br>Medvedev and Sergey Ivanov to the government put them in 
<br>front-runner positions. While some (XXXXXXXXXXXX)
<br>argue that Medvedev is likely to get the nod for the presidency
<br>with Sergey Ivanov as his prime minister, we do not see
<br>compelling  evidence for that conclusion. An at least equally
<br>strong  argument, we believe, could be made in favor of Sergey Ivanov  as president and Medvedev as prime minister, given Putin's 
<br>demonstrated trust in Ivanov and the likelihood that, in a 
<br>world seen to be full of external challenges to Russia, a 
<br>"silovik" with experience in the KGB/FSB, as head of the 
<br>Security Council, and as Defense Minister and manager of the 
<br>
<br>MOSCOW 00005740 005 OF 005 
<br>
<br>military-industrial complex would be seen as best prepared 
<br>and most credible as head of state. 
<br>
<br>¶20. (C) Putin's present interest lies in leaving such issues 
<br>unresolved, to prevent the initiation of a shift of power 
<br>away from him and towards any perceived successor. The 
<br>uncertainty that is beneficial to him, however, feeds 
<br>competition among possible (or at least self-perceived) 
<br>candidates jockeying for position, and encourages a 
<br>feeding-frenzy among those currently in high positions who 
<br>fear their snouts could soon be torn from the trough.
