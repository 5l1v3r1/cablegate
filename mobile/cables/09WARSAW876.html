<br>SUBJECT: RETHINKING U.S. FORCE REDUCTIONS IN EUROPE: VIEW 
<br>FROM POLAND 
<br>
<br>REF: A. USNATO 329 
<br>¶B. BERLIN 935 
<br>¶C. WARSAW 360 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Victor Ashe for Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) SUMMARY: Embassy Warsaw believes there would be a 
<br>strong, negative Polish reaction to major U.S. force 
<br>reductions in Europe. From Poland,s perspective, a big 
<br>drawdown would be seen as evidence that the U.S. is less 
<br>committed to European security at a time of heightened 
<br>concern over the intentions of a resurgent Russia. Polish 
<br>officials have emphasized the need for NATO to bolster its 
<br>military capabilities to avoid becoming a political club more 
<br>than a military alliance. They are adamant about revising 
<br>NATO,s Strategic Concept to restore the balance between 
<br>external missions and territorial defense; they will strongly 
<br>protest a reduction in the resources needed for that defense. 
<br>The Poles tell us that it would be hard to justify continued 
<br>sacrifices in missions like ISAF if cooperation with the 
<br>Alliance is a one-way street, and the U.S. and other Allies 
<br>do not take Polish security concerns into account. END 
<br>SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) The Poles believe they have an implicit 
<br>understanding with the United States and the Alliance: they 
<br>will take active part in missions far from their borders, 
<br>particularly in Afghanistan, provided that the Alliance makes 
<br>adequate provisions for the defense of Poland,s borders. 
<br>Poland is ISAF,s seventh leading troop contributor, fighting 
<br>without caveats in Southern Afghanistan, and Foreign Minister 
<br>Sikorski told us recently that he is pressing Prime Minister 
<br>Tusk to approve another troop increase, from 2,000 to 3,000 
<br>soldiers. Some analysts have told us (Ref C) that the 
<br>greatest threat to Polish resolve in Afghanistan would not be 
<br>increased casualties, but a failure by the Alliance to 
<br>address Poland,s concerns about Europe,s territorial 
<br>defense. Poland would see U.S. troop cuts as compounding 
<br>shortfalls in the resources and political will needed to 
<br>defend Europe. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) Unlike the previous Polish government, the Tusk 
<br>government is not reflexively Russophobic, but Polish 
<br>officials remain concerned about a resurgent Russia. The GoP 
<br>took the lead in marshalling an EU reaction to Russia,s 
<br>invasion of Georgia, and faulted the U.S., among others, for 
<br>doing too little, too late. In a speech at the Atlantic 
<br>Council last year, the Foreign Minister launched the 
<br>&Sikorski doctrine8: the West must respond adequately the 
<br>next time Russia tries to change Europe,s borders by force. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) Foreign Minister Sikorski has told U.S. leaders 
<br>emphatically that NATO risks becoming a political club more 
<br>than a military alliance ) he believes it needs to change 
<br>the politically correct threat assessments (particularly 
<br>those concerning Russia), and put in place substantial 
<br>contingency planning and exercises. During bilateral talks 
<br>with the U.S. on Missile Defense, the Poles implied that the 
<br>Alliance,s Article V guarantees may not be dependable, and 
<br>pressed for bilateral U.S. security guarantees. As NATO 
<br>launches the process of revising NATO,s Strategic Concept, 
<br>the Poles are pushing hard to restore balance between 
<br>out-of-area operations and territorial defense. Polish 
<br>officials have hinted at how strong the reaction would be if 
<br>their concerns are not addressed in the new Strategic 
<br>Concept; the reaction would doubtless be even stronger if 
<br>they perceived strategic guidance as undercut by U.S. force 
<br>reductions. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) Poland would see significant U.S. force reductions 
<br>in Europe as the latest in a series of disappointments with 
<br>the U.S.: in their view, the U.S. failed to deliver promised 
<br>Iraqi contracts, to bring a loyal Ally into the Visa Waiver 
<br>Program, and most recently, to appoint an appropriately 
<br>high-level presidential delegation to the September 1 
<br>commemoration in Gdansk of the 70th anniversary of the 
<br>outbreak of World War II. Many Poles see this as part of a 
<br>broader regional trend, a downgrading of U.S. interest in 
<br>Central and Eastern Europe. Three Polish statesmen, Lech 
<br>Walesa, Aleksander Kwasniewski and Adam Daniel Rotfeld, were 
<br>among the signatories of the July letter from Central 
<br>European leaders to President Obama. The letter warned that 
<br>the region,s stability and Atlanticist outlook cannot be 
<br>taken for granted in the face of allegedly waning U.S. 
<br>engagement.
