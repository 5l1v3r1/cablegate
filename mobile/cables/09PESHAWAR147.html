<br>
<br>CLASSIFIED BY: Lynne Tracy, Principal Officer, U.S. Consulate 
<br>Peshawar, Department of State. 
<br>REASON: 1.4 (d) 
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: As the government of Pakistan has worked to 
<br>prepare for its upcoming ground operation in South Waziristan 
<br>Agency (SWA) against Baitullah Mehsud (ref C) and the 
<br>Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), it has narrowed the focus of 
<br>its operation by attempting to keep neutral the two other major 
<br>militant leaders in the area and building two other more minor 
<br>leaders up against Baitullah. The government has worked through 
<br>jirgas led by Deobandi clerics associated with the Jamiat 
<br>Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) to isolate Baitullah and his lieutenants; 
<br>as the operation has become more imminent (and to JUI-F leader 
<br>Fazlur Rehman's chagrin), these jirgas have been sidelined. 
<br>Tribal maliks, though included in those jirgas, are too cowed to 
<br>play anything other than supporting roles, and the SWA Political 
<br>Agent, while talented, is rarely able to even enter SWA due to 
<br>security concerns. Political actors will continue to work 
<br>around the edges, but they are ceding the field to the military 
<br>and militants for the foreseeable future. End summary. 
<br>
<br>Baitullah Mehsud and His Lieutenants 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) 35-year-old Baitullah Mehsud has been the most 
<br>prominent militant in Waziristan since the death of Wazir leader 
<br>Nek Mohammad in 2004 and the most notorious militant in Pakistan 
<br>since his announcement of the formation of the TTP and 
<br>assassination of Benazir Bhutto in December 2007. He has 
<br>undisputed control over the Mehsud home areas of northeastern 
<br>SWA and significant influence in areas with Mehsud diaspora 
<br>populations such as Tank and Dera Ismail Khan districts. Since 
<br>the formation of TTP, an umbrella group whose expressed aim is 
<br>to overthrow the government of Pakistan and secure its FATA 
<br>safehaven in order to support cross-border attacks into 
<br>Afghanistan, Mehsud and his allies had established significant 
<br>levels of effective control in part or all of Kurram, Orakzai, 
<br>Khyber, Mohmand, and Bajaur agencies, as well as in Swat, 
<br>Shangla, Buner, and Lower Dir districts prior to recent military 
<br>operations. In all of these areas, Consulate contacts and 
<br>Pakistani press have reported a strong presence of Mehsud 
<br>tribesmen and allied Uzbek militants supporting local elements 
<br>fighting against the government. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Qari Hussain has long been Baitullah's most feared 
<br>lieutenant from Waziristan; a post contact in the NWFP 
<br>parliamentary assembly included him as one of six militants 
<br>whose death would prove that the Pakistani government was 
<br>"serious" about finally getting tough on militants. He was 
<br>notable over the period 2006-8 for claiming the most extreme and 
<br>offensive actions taken by the TTP, particularly in the wake of 
<br>the government's July 2007 operation against the Lal Masjid in 
<br>Islamabad. These actions included suicide bombings throughout 
<br>the NWFP, the kidnapping of FC personnel, and an attack on the 
<br>Tank family residence of the Political Agent for Khyber Agency 
<br>which killed many of his relatives and guests, among them 
<br>surrendering women and girls, violating one of the strongest 
<br>taboos under Pashtun tribal law. Baitullah disavowed most of 
<br>these activities, though they generally directly benefited him. 
<br>In late 2008, after the conclusion of the most recent peace deal 
<br>in SWA, Baitullah "exiled" him to North Waziristan because of 
<br>his poor image; he recalled him to SWA recently. Hussain may 
<br>have been killed in an air strike on a post-funeral meeting on 
<br>June 23 in South Waziristan. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) Hakimullah Mehsud, a first cousin to Baitullah, has 
<br>come to prominence more recently, initially commanding TTP 
<br>forces assisting Sunni militants who were fighting Shi'a 
<br>militants in Kurram agency and neighboring Hangu district. His 
<br>activities quickly spread to Orakzai, where he masterminded an 
<br>October 2008 suicide bombing of a jirga that killed over fifty 
<br>tribal maliks and broke virtually all organized resistance to 
<br>TTP control in most of the agency. By early December 2008, his 
<br>men in Khyber were launching regular raids on trucking depots 
<br>around Peshawar and burning hundreds of trucks containing 
<br>supplies for American forces in Afghanistan. A Pakistani 
<br>military operation in Khyber in January 2009 reduced TTP 
<br>effectiveness operating out of that agency, but Hakimullah 
<br>continued to plan and execute attacks out of his base in Orakzai 
<br>
<br>PESHAWAR 00000147 002 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>prior to returning to SWA in late May, reportedly with large 
<br>numbers of those under his command and in preparation for the 
<br>upcoming SWA operation. 
<br>
<br>Misbahuddin Mehsud and Turkestan Bhittani - GOP Surrogates 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
<br>¶5. (C) Misbahuddin Mehsud, the 23-year-old younger brother 
<br>of the recently assassinated Qari Zainuddin (ref C), is 
<br>Zainuddin's apparent successor as leader of a group of Mehsuds 
<br>independent of Baitullah who have engaged in tit-for-tat 
<br>assassinations and street battles with the TTP in the areas of 
<br>Tank and Dera Ismail Khan over the past several months. 
<br>Zainuddin was generally considered raw and untested; his close 
<br>familial relation (first cousin) to deceased militant leader 
<br>Abdullah Mehsud and the clear Pakistani government backing given 
<br>to him, however, had made him the pole around which 
<br>anti-Baitullah militants had coalesced. Misbahuddin is even 
<br>more untried. He is reportedly more poorly educated and rougher 
<br>of manner than Zainuddin (Misbahuddin's nickname is Tofan, 
<br>meaning "storm" and referring to his temper). 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Turkestan Bhittani, a 40-year-old soldier who retired 
<br>from the South Waziristan Scouts (Frontier Corps) in 1998 to 
<br>fight for the Taliban in Afghanistan, was an ally of Baitullah 
<br>Mehsud until 2007. Following his break with Baitullah, he 
<br>formed a militia composed primarily of members of the Bhittani 
<br>tribe. The Bhittani, whose population lives primarily in the 
<br>area along the border between SWA and Tank and controls access 
<br>between Mehsud territory and the settled areas to the east, has 
<br>a history of feuds with the Mehsuds; relatively few Mehsuds are 
<br>settled in Jandola and the other Bhittani-dominated areas around 
<br>it. A June 2008 incident in which TTP-affiliated Mehsuds 
<br>overran the town of Jandola and carried off thirty Bhittani 
<br>tribesmen and killed over twenty of them (including many close 
<br>relatives of Turkestan) solidified Bhittani tribal opposition to 
<br>the TTP. As Qari Zainuddin's group gained mass over recent 
<br>months, Turkestan allied his own, longer-lived group to it, and 
<br>this alliance seems unlikely to change with Zainuddin's death. 
<br>A Bhittani contact told us that it was Turkestan's firm control 
<br>of F.R. Tank that allowed Qari Zainuddin space to grow his 
<br>group; Turkestan had and continues to have a strong personal 
<br>interest in assisting any group that would weaken the TTP. 
<br>
<br>Hafiz Gul Bahadur - Siding with the TTP 
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Hafiz Gul Bahadur, a senior militant commander in 
<br>North Waziristan Agency (NWA) and erstwhile rival of Baitullah 
<br>Mehsud for the title of "leader" of the Tehrik-i-Taliban, is an 
<br>Utmanzai Wazir in his late 40s. Despite considerable effort by 
<br>the Pakistani government to keep him on the sidelines and an 
<br>initial period in which his quiescence appeared to indicate that 
<br>he would stay out of the fight, Bahadur allowed and then claimed 
<br>a series of escalating ambushes of Pakistani military convoys 
<br>June 26-28. His spokesman then announced on June 29 that the 
<br>February 2008 peace deal with the government that Bahadur had 
<br>hitherto more or less respected was now a dead letter due to 
<br>continued drone strikes in and Pakistani military operations 
<br>near NWA (ref B). (Note: Consulate contacts told us that 
<br>Bahadur had faced pressure from lieutenants to confront the 
<br>Pakistani military.) The government responded with airstrikes 
<br>against his positions on June 30, but reiterated its commitment 
<br>to the peace deal. A low-level conflict has ensued since, with 
<br>occasional minor attacks by militants on Pakistani military 
<br>installations. 
<br>
<br>Maulavi Nazir - Neutral? 
<br>------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Maulavi Nazir, the senior militant commander in 
<br>southern and western SWA, is an Ahmadzai Wazir in his 30s. Our 
<br>contacts from and in SWA consider Nazir to have been the 
<br>Pakistani government's man ever since his 2007 campaign against 
<br>Baitullah Mehsud ally Haji Omar and associated Uzbek militants 
<br>residing in Ahmadzai areas of SWA, though Nazir signed on to the 
<br>February 2009 alliance with Baitullah. Like Bahadur, he has 
<br>remained silent about the upcoming operation; on July 2, he told 
<br>
<br>PESHAWAR 00000147 003 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>a jirga that he would maintain neutrality. A well-connected 
<br>Ahmadzai Wazir who resides part-time in Wana told us that Nazir 
<br>will stay out of the fight unless a spillover from the campaign 
<br>creates significant casualties among Ahmadzai Wazir militants or 
<br>civilians. In such a circumstance, Nazir would come under 
<br>considerable pressure to retaliate proportionately. This is a 
<br>plausible eventuality. According to a Consulate contact in SWA, 
<br>since the beginning of June, an Ahmadzai lieutenant of Nazir in 
<br>the Angoor Adda area of SWA (near the Afghan border) has 
<br>repeatedly detonated roadside bombs against Pakistani military 
<br>vehicles, killing several soldiers and wounding dozens of 
<br>others. More recently, over the past two weeks rockets have 
<br>been fired from Ahmadzai Wazir areas toward Pakistani military 
<br>installations in and around Wana. The Pakistani army has 
<br>retaliated in each instance by shelling militant positions in 
<br>the areas from which attacks have been launched. 
<br>
<br>The Haqqanis - Staying Out of the Fight 
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶9. (S) Jalaluddin Haqqani and his son Sirajuddin, Afghans 
<br>who are based primarily in NWA, are involved primarily in the 
<br>fight against coalition forces in Afghanistan. Jalaluddin, a 
<br>former anti-Soviet mujahid from the Zadran tribe who had been 
<br>aligned with Hizb-i-Islami (Khalis), is now in his 70s and is 
<br>considered by our contacts to have a close relationship with 
<br>Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar. Sirajuddin, in his 
<br>30s, runs day-to-day affairs for the Haqqani network. This 
<br>Taliban group operates primarily in Khowst and Paktika provinces 
<br>but is also suspected of having a hand in some of the most 
<br>audacious Taliban attacks in Kabul, including the July 2008 
<br>bombing of the Indian embassy there. The Haqqanis have 
<br>generally taken the stance that attacks against Pakistan's 
<br>government are illegitimate, and they have worked to keep 
<br>militant leaders in Waziristan focused on the war in Afghanistan 
<br>- without success in the case of Gul Bahadur. They appear to be 
<br>hunkering down as well; a Consulate contact in the inner circle 
<br>of the NWFP's ruling Awami National Party (ANP) says that they 
<br>have moved their families out of the agency and to Rawalpindi 
<br>(ref A). 
<br>
<br>Maulana Fazlur Rehman and the Deobandis - The Would-Be Mediators 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) The opening moves to the government's SWA campaign 
<br>have occasioned a flurry of jirgas aimed at mediating between 
<br>the Pakistani government and the various militant leaders. 
<br>These jirgas have been very similarly composed: led by elected 
<br>officials or prominent mullahs (and usually both), they have 
<br>been composed in equal measure by maliks from the affected areas 
<br>and prominent mullahs active in the region but outside of tribal 
<br>structures. The most active jirga, which has been shuttling 
<br>between the Pakistani government and Baitullah Mehsud, has been 
<br>led by Senator Saleh Shah, a Deobandi cleric in his thirties 
<br>from SWA (but not a Mehsud or Wazir) who leads two madrassas, 
<br>one in the Tirarzia tehsil of SWA (north of Wana, in the Mehsud 
<br>area) and the other in the Mehsud-settled Murtaza area of Tank. 
<br>In his absence (when the Senate is in session), jirga leadership 
<br>has generally fallen to Maulana Esamuddin Khan, a Mehsud 
<br>Deobandi cleric who has led a madrassa in Makeen, the heart of 
<br>the area controlled by Baitullah. Maulana Mirajuddin Qureshi, 
<br>another Mehsud Deobandi cleric who is a former National Assembly 
<br>member, has also played a leading role. Over the past two 
<br>weeks, activity by this jirga has tailed off as military 
<br>operations have increased their pace. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Saleh Shah, Esamuddin, and Qureshi (along with fellow 
<br>repeated jirga leaders Noor Mohammad among the Ahmadzai Wazirs 
<br>and Maulavi Nek Zaman among the Utmanzai Wazirs) are affiliated 
<br>with the Deobandi Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam party faction under the 
<br>direction of Maulana Fazlur Rehman (JUI-F). Fazlur Rehman, 
<br>whose hometown is nearby Dera Ismail Khan, has positioned 
<br>himself and his party as a primary mediator between the 
<br>government and militants; his affiliates have been mediators in 
<br>each of the five peace agreements concluded in the Waziristans 
<br>since 2004. His decreasingly oblique criticisms of Pakistani 
<br>military operations in Swat and the surrounding Malakand 
<br>
<br>PESHAWAR 00000147 004 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>division and his more direct criticisms of a follow-on 
<br>Waziristan operation have kept pace with the increasing drumbeat 
<br>of official talk about Waziristan. Fazlur Rehman's upset at the 
<br>prospect of such an operation may in part be a reaction the 
<br>political support that his party continues to carry there 
<br>(significantly greater than that enjoyed by his party in 
<br>Malakand), but it also reflects the fact that the beginning of 
<br>such an operation will represent the eclipse of his affiliates' 
<br>mediating role in favor of force wielded by parties outside of 
<br>his control. 
<br>
<br>The Maliks - A Non-Factor 
<br>------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) The peace jirgas of the past two months, led and 
<br>partially staffed by Deobandi clerics, have generally been 
<br>filled out by Mehsud maliks (tribal elders). Our contacts from 
<br>SWA have uniformly dismissed them as entirely cowed by Baitullah 
<br>and irrelevant in mediation; the deaths of over three hundred 
<br>other Waziristan maliks over the past four years appear to have 
<br>sapped them of the willingness to confront Baitullah in any way 
<br>and rendered them essentially placeholders in the jirgas for 
<br>sake of form. Asked if there were any maliks of sufficient 
<br>stature to chart an independent course at all, one contact 
<br>responded with a Pashtun proverb in which a prince, queried on 
<br>how he kept his kingdom under control, replied by silently 
<br>chopping off the tops of all of the tallest poppies in the field 
<br>where he was walking. 
<br>
<br>Shahab Ali Khan - The Absentee Political Agent 
<br>--------------------------------------------- - 
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Shahab Ali Khan, a Bannu native in his mid-30s, was 
<br>appointed Political Agent (PA) of SWA in September 2008. He has 
<br>been in district government service for just over ten years; 
<br>before his current posting, Khan had most recently served as 
<br>District Coordination Officer in the sectarian strife-ridden 
<br>Hangu district from 2007. Shahab Ali has been described by his 
<br>peers and locals as a good negotiator in an agency where many 
<br>consider such skills a necessity, and he most recently played a 
<br>secondary role in the release of the kidnapped students from 
<br>Razmak Cadet College. He reportedly holds conservative views 
<br>and is pious. His youth is noted by his colleagues, though it 
<br>is not his greatest handicap: effective militant control over 
<br>virtually all of "his" agency makes it difficult to travel 
<br>outside of Wana and makes life dangerous even in that city. He 
<br>reputedly spends most of his time in Tank. 
<br>
<br>The Division Commanders - A Mixed Bag 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) The commanders of the three Pakistani military 
<br>divisions that will bear the brunt of the fight in Waziristan 
<br>come from widely varying backgrounds. The Seventh Division, 
<br>headquartered in Miram Shah, NWA, is commanded by Major General 
<br>Navid Zaman. Zaman, a Punjabi from Rawalpindi, spent several 
<br>successful years as a staff officer at Pakistan's General 
<br>Headquarters (GHQ) prior to assuming command in October 2008. 
<br>The Ninth Division, headquartered in Wana, SWA, is commanded by 
<br>Khalid Rabbani. Rabbani, who has previous experience as a 
<br>brigade commander in the FATA, was most recently assigned as 
<br>Pakistan's Defense Attache to Libya and Algeria, which face 
<br>counterinsurgency challenges of their own. He left that 
<br>position at the end of 2007 and was given command of the Ninth 
<br>Division at roughly that time, making him the longest-serving of 
<br>the three in their current capacities (ref E). The Fourteenth 
<br>Division, headquartered in Tank, is commanded by Major General 
<br>Ijaz Chaudhry, of whom less is known; he assumed command of the 
<br>division in September 2008. 
<br>
<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) Baitullah Mehsud and the military are the predominant 
<br>actors in South Waziristan. However, as the government plays 
<br>out a strategy of divide and rule, the alliances, feuding, and 
<br>maneuverings of other militants as well as tribal and political 
<br>
<br>PESHAWAR 00000147 005 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>figures bears watching in assessing the direction that 
<br>operations in South Waziristan will take. End comment.
