<br>SUBJECT: SPAIN: DHS SEC. NAPOLITANO'S MEETING WITH ZAPATERO 
<br> 
<br>REF: MADRID 614 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Charge D'Affaires Arnold A. Chacon for reasons 1.4 (b)  and (d) 
<br> 
<br>Â¶1. (C) SUMMARY AND COMMENT. In a clear signal that Spain 
<br>wants to work closely with the Obama Administration on a 
<br>range of security issues, President Jose Luis Rodriguez 
<br>Zapatero and several of his key cabinet ministers held 
<br>extended meetings in Madrid on July 1 with DHS Secretary 
<br>Janet Napolitano and members of her delegation.  The 
<br>Secretary's meetings highlighted the importance that the USG 
<br>places on the bilateral relationship and the numerous 
<br>programs that DHS is working on with our Spanish hosts.  The 
<br>Secretary also urged Spain to use its upcoming EU Presidency 
<br>to resolve issues of data privacy and information sharing 
<br>between the U.S. and the EU.  The interaction also served to 
<br>establish close personal ties with senior members of the 
<br>Zapatero Administration.  The meeting with Zapatero marked 
<br>the longest time that Zapatero - in office since 2004 -  has 
<br>spent in private discussions with senior USG officials. 
<br>Zapatero, who spent 90 minutes with the Secretary in a 
<br>meeting that was scheduled to last an hour, expounded on his 
<br>views, with characteristic optimism, across a range of global 
<br>issues and regional hotspots.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT.
