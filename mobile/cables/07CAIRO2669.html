<br>SUBJECT: GAMAL MUBARAK ADVISOR DISCUSSES EGYPT'S ASSISTANCE 
<br>PACKAGE 
<br>
<br>
<br>Classified By: Minister Counselor for Economic and Political 
<br>Affairs William R. Stewart for reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Mohamed Farnawany, senior advisor to Gamal Mubarak, 
<br>told poloff on August 27 that the GOE is not happy that the 
<br>USG never responded to the ESF proposal to create an 
<br>endowment. Poloff reminded Farnawany that the U.S. did 
<br>respond, explaining the difficulties with the concept. 
<br>Farnawany said that Egypt nonetheless feels that the U.S. is 
<br>making assistance decisions unilaterally, without substantive 
<br>engagement with GOE officials, and said Egypt would like to 
<br>discuss the direction of both ESF and FMF. When poloff noted 
<br>that the proposed ten-year FMF package was exactly what Egypt 
<br>requested, Farnawany said MoD concern stems from the decision 
<br>to increase Israel's FMF, thereby moving away from the 3:2 
<br>assistance ratio that previously existed. He noted that the 
<br>"MoD Generals" used to be the USG's "staunchest allies," but 
<br>now "things are different." He said he believes the MoD 
<br>officials want more engagement with U.S. DoD counterparts. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Poloff told Farnawany that the current focus on 
<br>Egypt's counter-smuggling efforts will likely continue. The 
<br>advisor said that Egypt needs a new approach with the Hill -- 
<br>a point he said he had raised recently with Ambassador Fahmy. 
<br>He thought that MoD's receptivity to U.S. proposals on 
<br>enhancing border security (particularly technical support and 
<br>training) may be linked to the degree to which MOD perceives 
<br>that the administration is vigorously defending FMF.
