<br>REF: 09 XXXXXXXXXXXX 167 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Consul General Stephen B. Wickman. For 
<br>Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) SUMMARY: On December 15, EAP DAS XXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXX staff met with XXXXXXXXXXXX, a major player 
<br>here in Chinese-North Korean economic exchanges. XXXXXXXXXXXX 
<br>attributed the DPRK,s recent currency reform to several 
<br>factors: controlling rampant inflation, preventing 'hot 
<br>money' flows, leveling the wealth gap between workers and 
<br>traders, controlling domestic currency, and most importantly, 
<br>uncovering potential political opposition. As a result of the 
<br>reform, commerce has come to a halt. The leadership, as part 
<br>of an ambitious 2012 development strategy, hopes for the 
<br>restoration of relations with the United States. XXXXXXXXXXXX also 
<br>believes that current plans assume Kim Jong-il will be around 
<br>for some time and that Kim Jong-un will be his successor. The 
<br>recent recall of DPRK scholars, students and scientists from 
<br>China following the defection of a North Korean exchange 
<br>student, for example, suggests increasing levels of paranoia. 
<br>END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>GIVE ME GOOD REASON 
<br>------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) On December 15, EAP DAS David Shear and Consulate 
<br>Shenyang staff met with XXXXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXXXX visits 
<br>Pyongyang frequently. Admitting he is unsure of the exact 
<br>value of Chinese investment into North Korea, XXXXXXXXXXXX believes 
<br>the number to be many billions of renminbi. Chinese 
<br>companies, like their ROK counterparts, use North Korea as a 
<br>processing zone, primarily in the mining and seafood 
<br>industries. According to XXXXXXXXXXXX, the DPRK leadership's 2012 
<br>target for achieving 'strong-country' status should form the 
<br>principal basis for analyzing recent political developments, 
<br>including the currency reform measure. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) The most important reason for the recent DPRK currency 
<br>reform, according to XXXXXXXXXXXX, is to uncover political opposition, 
<br>particularly against Kim Jong-il's younger son. Controlling 
<br>inflation, leveling the wealth gap, controlling domestic 
<br>currency and access to foreign currency, are all part of this 
<br>strategy. XXXXXXXXXXXX believes that the third son, Kim Jong-un, 
<br>favored the currency revaluation, and that going forward Kim 
<br>Jong-un leans toward a Vietnamese-style of economic reform. 
<br>Opposition to the currency exchange, according to XXXXXXXXXXXX, might 
<br>reveal who opposes the ascension of Kim Jong-un to 
<br>leadership. According to XXXXXXXXXXXX, Kim Jong-il's support of the 
<br>currency reform points to his favoring the third son; those 
<br>opposing the revaluation, also oppose the third son. XXXXXXXXXXXX drew 
<br>parallels to the 2009 nuclear tests, which he said were 
<br>also influenced by succession plans. XXXXXXXXXXXX said that the first 
<br>son, Kim Jong-nam, opposes his younger brother's reform 
<br>plans and favors a Chinese-style of economic opening. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) XXXXXXXXXXXX said that the number of factions competing for Kim 
<br>Jong-il's attention have made it increasingly difficult for 
<br>Kim Jong-il to listen to anyone. As a sign of Kim Jong-il's 
<br>paranoia, he recently recalled all students, scholars, and 
<br>scientists in China following the defection of an exchange 
<br>student in Northeast China. He did this despite the need for 
<br>Chinese knowledge, production skills, and technology to 
<br>achieve the country's goals for 2012. However, XXXXXXXXXXXX believes 
<br>that current instability will settle and the government will 
<br>move ahead with reform, fully expecting Kim Jong-il to be 
<br>around for sometime to come. The reform, according to XXXXXXXXXXXX, may 
<br>not be toward a more open economy. Rather, with currency 
<br>reform giving the regime the ability to control domestic 
<br>currency, reforms will lead to tighter control over the 
<br>economy. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) Prior to revaluation, one dollar equaled 3500 won. To 
<br>put that in perspective, the average worker in Pyongyang 
<br>earns 3000-4000 won per month. XXXXXXXXXXXX reported that according to 
<br>the DPRK Embassy, the official exchange rate following reform 
<br>is now one dollar equals 129 won. For the common person, 
<br>
<br>SHENYANG 00000004 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>besides suffering from a significant cut in won-based 
<br>savings, supermarkets and department stores that deal in won 
<br>have suspended activity as they wait to see what impact 
<br>currency reform will have on commodity prices. Thus, it has 
<br>become difficult to purchase day-to-day needs. XXXXXXXXXXXX pointed 
<br>out, if commodity prices rise, the economy will be ruined. 
<br>However, if prices settle as a result of reform, and assuming 
<br>constant wages, the economy will be okay as workers once 
<br>earning one dollar a month will now earn nearly 20 dollars. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S) Traders, who earn many times more than the average 
<br>wage-earner, have been unaffected by the reform in monetary 
<br>terms, as savings are held mostly in euro and dollars. Since 
<br>the revaluation, only stores dealing with foreign exchange 
<br>have been open and prices in these stores have increased 
<br>400-500 percent. For example, a TV that cost RMB 4000 now 
<br>costs RMB 20,000. Many of these stores raised prices in 
<br>anticipation of the reform, with the expectation that prices 
<br>would then fall. However, prices have not fallen. Many of the 
<br>stores that raised prices prior to reform have since been 
<br>closed by the government, their goods confiscated. Thus, even 
<br>traders who have not lost money from revaluation now have 
<br>nothing to buy. Chinese traders along the North Korean border 
<br>have also been affected by currency reform even though most 
<br>trade is done in euros and dollars. As is the case within 
<br>North Korea, people are waiting and watching to see what will 
<br>happen to prices. In the meantime, nobody wants to sell 
<br>anything. 
<br>
<br>NOT A CRISIS YET BUT CLOSE 
<br>-------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S/NF) XXXXXXXXXXXX does not believe the DPRK is in crisis mode at this 
<br>time. As he said, the people are used to this sort of thing. 
<br>He saw the currency reform as being part of a broader 
<br>conflict within the government as it moves forward in the 
<br>next several years. Since 2002, the DPRK has allowed some 
<br>economic reform, without expressing strong support or 
<br>opposition. As he put it, the government has been waiting and 
<br>watching to see what would happen. 
<br>
<br>CHINA, the U.S., and EVERYTHING 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (S/NF) XXXXXXXXXXXX said many in the DPRK believe the Chinese do not 
<br>understand their country. While neither the Chinese nor the 
<br>DPRK are likely to criticize the other in public, XXXXXXXXXXXX said 
<br>that in private the DPRK has disparaged the Chinese for not 
<br>including North Korea on its list of 147 tourist destinations 
<br>or 137 investment destinations. These omissions and the 
<br>disparate Chinese actions on regional development projects 
<br>clearly indicate that North Korea is not a priority for the 
<br>Chinese. For instance, while China recently elevated the 
<br>long-beleaguered Changchun-Jilin-Tumen River development plan 
<br>to a national level project, the DPRK left the Tumen River 
<br>Development Plan, as it sees no benefit (REFTEL). Relations 
<br>between the two countries were getting so bad, in fact, 
<br>Premier Wen Jiabao visited Pyongyang two months ahead of 
<br>schedule. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (S/NF) According to XXXXXXXXXXXX, North Korea has set an ambitious 
<br>target of developing a strong country by 2012. As part of 
<br>this project, it is planning to build 100,000 residential 
<br>apartments in Pyongyang by 2012. In order to encourage 
<br>Chinese investment, the DPRK is offering Chinese investors 
<br>mining and ocean rights for their injection of cash into the 
<br>project. A former Consul General of the North Korean 
<br>consulate in Shenyang, recently spent two weeks in Beijing 
<br>attracting about RMB 12 billion for this project and planned 
<br>to come to Shenyang following his time in Beijing. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (S) Restoration of relations with the United States is 
<br>another important part of the DPRK's reform plans. He said, 
<br>however, that North Korea looks forward to an ongoing cycle 
<br>of ups and downs in negotiations and that it counts on the 
<br>U.N. to be slow in implementing sanctions. As he said, he 
<br>believes that once things settle down, North Korea will show 
<br>China and the U.S. "its bottom card."
