<br>
<br>
<br>Classified By: Political Minister-Counselor Josiah Rosenblatt, reasons 
<br>1.4 (b/d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: Togo's former Interior Minister Francois 
<br>Boko on January 31 discussed Togo-Cote d'Ivoire arms 
<br>trafficking (planes piloted by Belarusian mercenaries were 
<br>involved in the November 2004 bombings in Cote d'Ivoire and 
<br>had transited Togo, but France did not pursue information 
<br>Boko says he provided); political developments in Togo 
<br>(President Faure uninterested in reform, continues to allow 
<br>and benefit from illicit activities of his associates); and 
<br>Boko's intentions to play a public role in Togo-related 
<br>politics. Boko and the head of the Paris law firm that 
<br>employs him also offered brief comments on China's activities 
<br>in Africa. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) At his invitation, we met on January 31 with 
<br>Francois Boko, who had served as Togo's Interior Minister 
<br>until April 2005, when he was removed from office, took 
<br>refuge in the German Embassy, and then left for exile in 
<br>France. Boko had broken ranks with the GoT by calling for 
<br>the postponement of elections in Togo in view of the 
<br>instability building during the pre-election period (Ref A). 
<br>
<br>TOGO-COTE d'IVOIRE ARMS TRAFFICKING 
<br>----------------------------------- 
<br>¶3. (C) Boko commented extensively on the links between Togo 
<br>and the November 6, 2004, bombing in Cote d'Ivoire, when GOCI 
<br>forces attacked a French military base, killing nine French 
<br>soldiers and an Amcit civilian. He said that the two 
<br>Sukhoi-25 aircraft used in the bombing had been provided to 
<br>the GOCI by former French gendarme Robert Montoya (Refs B and 
<br>C). Montoya had obtained these and other aircraft and 
<br>military equipment from Belarus and had also engaged 
<br>Belarusian pilots and technicians. The planes had arrived 
<br>unassembled in Togo, where they were assembled and then flown 
<br>to Cote d'Ivoire. Boko said that the GoT leadership and 
<br>military were aware of the presence of the planes and 
<br>pilots/technicians in Togo. Boko said that French forces 
<br>also had to be aware of their presence because the Belarusian 
<br>planes were kept at the same Lome air facility the French 
<br>were using to operate their own air missions in support of 
<br>French forces in Cote d'Ivoire. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) After the November 6 bombings, Boko said that he had 
<br>had the Belarusian pilots/technicians arrested when they 
<br>returned to Togo from Cote d'Ivoire. He said that there were 
<br>nine of them. Boko said he furnished details about their 
<br>identities and activities to the French, through France's 
<br>Embassy in Lome and also through direct contact with General 
<br>Poncet, who then commanded France's Operation Licorne in Cote 
<br>d'Ivoire. Boko thought there would be high French interest 
<br>in the information he had conveyed but was surprised when the 
<br>French did not express much interest. After holding the nine 
<br>Belarusians for about two weeks, Boko was told by the French 
<br>(including General Poncet, who communicated directly with 
<br>Boko) to release them. The only explanation he received 
<br>(again including from General Poncet) was that France "was 
<br>not looking to complicate relations with Belarus over this 
<br>matter." 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Boko said he found this lack of French interest 
<br>surprising inasmuch as the bombing had resulted in the deaths 
<br>of French soldiers. He predicted that a scandal was brewing 
<br>that might erupt once French judicial investigation (Ref C, 
<br>paras 6-7) of the case unearthed more facts. Boko said that 
<br>recent French media reports on the "discovery" of a second 
<br>set of planes in Lome, along with their connection to 
<br>Montoya, were in fact an old story that the press should have 
<br>reported a year ago. This issue was "news" only because of 
<br>Judge Brigitte Raynaud's investigation, itself prompted by 
<br>legal claims on the part of the families of the soldiers 
<br>killed in the raid. The planes had been sitting unused at 
<br>the Lome air facility since the time of the bombings in Cote 
<br>d'Ivoire. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Boko said that Robert Montoya was among the group of 
<br>French and other non-Togolese that had long had access to the 
<br>Eyadema regime. This group, which included Charles Debbasch 
<br>(Ref D), was involved in a great deal of nefarious activity 
<br>in Togo, Boko asserted, and had always enjoyed the protection 
<br>of the regime. Boko said that after the French press this 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00000741 002.2 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>past week had begun reporting on Montoya, his arms 
<br>trafficking, and his connection to Cote d'Ivoire, Montoya's 
<br>wife went to a notary in Togo who handled Montoya's 
<br>businesses. This notary, according to Boko, dissolved all of 
<br>Montoya's businesses and then created new ones, but listed 
<br>different owners. This, Boko said, was done to protect 
<br>Montoya's assets should legal action be taken against him or 
<br>his companies. Boko said that the GoT had issued Debbasch a 
<br>Togolese diplomatic passport as a form of protection. Even 
<br>though Debbasch had been convicted of financial offenses in 
<br>France and was therefore subject to arrest (Ref E), Boko 
<br>claims that Debbasch traveled to France to celebrate the 
<br>December 2005 holidays without, apparently, being hindered by 
<br>the GoF. 
<br>
<br>7, (U) See concluding paragraphs of this message for recent 
<br>media reports on the investigation into the November 6, 2004, 
<br>bombing. 
<br>
<br>DEVELOPMENTS IN TOGO 
<br>-------------------- 
<br>¶8. (C) Boko said that Faure was making no effort to 
<br>institute reform and seemed content to live within the 
<br>structures Eyadema had left for him. Boko related that the 
<br>small inner circle surrounding Faure (which included 
<br>foreigners such as Montoya and Debbasch) continued to carry 
<br>out their illicit activities, which benefited themselves and 
<br>Faure as well. This reliance on criminal or quasi-criminal 
<br>activities allowed Faure to lead a comfortable, if not 
<br>luxurious, life, and provided no incentive for him to 
<br>institute the kinds of reforms that might make Togo more 
<br>acceptable to international lenders or private sector 
<br>investors. All of which was very bad for Togo, in Boko's 
<br>view. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Boko noted Faure's inability to gain international 
<br>"recognition." No one of significance wanted to meet with 
<br>him and he could be considered a pariah internationally. One 
<br>of his only formal trips abroad had been to Iran, and who 
<br>needed Iran's blessing, Boko asked rhetorically. Boko said 
<br>that Faure had nine wives, one of whom was a cousin of 
<br>opposition leader Gilchrist Olympio (see below), with another 
<br>being the daughter of Ghana's President Kufuor. Boko said 
<br>these marriages were useful for Faure politically. 
<br>
<br>BOKO EXASPERATED WITH THE FRENCH 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>¶10. (C) Throughout the meeting, Boko expressed dismay with 
<br>French attitudes towards Togo. The French apparently did not 
<br>want to pursue the November 2004 bombing and the links with 
<br>Togo and Belarus, but this reticence, he again predicted, 
<br>could become more problematic if Judge Raynaud's 
<br>investigation gained traction with the media. (NOTE: French 
<br>investigative judges have a great deal of independence and 
<br>can pursue investigations that in some cases the rest of the 
<br>GoF might not want investigated. END NOTE.) Boko said the 
<br>French also did not seem concerned about Faure and his 
<br>failure to reform. Exasperated, Boko said France appeared 
<br>ready to do what it has done so many times before -- back 
<br>"the man of the moment" so long as "the man" can ensure some 
<br>degree of stability. Boko noted that the French had invested 
<br>so much in Eyadema that they perhaps could not contemplate 
<br>starting from scratch. He acknowledged that events in Cote 
<br>d'Ivoire, after Houphouet's death, may have served as a 
<br>lesson to the French in terms of seeking stability rather 
<br>than letting chaos ensue when a dynasty ends. 
<br>
<br>BOKO'S POLITICAL AMBITIONS 
<br>-------------------------- 
<br>¶11. (C) Boko confided that he was soon going to re-enter 
<br>the Togolese political scene. He was scheduled to be the 
<br>main speaker at a February 4 event in Paris to which all 
<br>Togolese, the press, and friends of Togo were invited. He 
<br>explained that he was not speaking at this event to proclaim 
<br>himself as the "opposition's new leader," but instead hoped 
<br>that the meeting would allow for open discussion of events in 
<br>Togo and serve as a vehicle for uniting the Togolese diaspora. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Boko said he planned to speak on three general 
<br>themes: (1) the need for Togo's opposition leaders and 
<br>members of the diaspora to put aside factional differences 
<br>and meet together to discuss Togo's future and adopt a common 
<br>roadmap for progress; (2) the need to reassure and win over 
<br>Togo's military by explaining that "reform" was not directed 
<br>against the military; and (3) the need to unite in demanding 
<br>that Togo's constitution and laws be respected, particularly 
<br>concerning presidential succession. 
<br>
<br>
<br>PARIS 00000741 003.2 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Boko at an earlier meeting revealed that the GoF, 
<br>upon allowing him to live in France, suggested that he not 
<br>get involved in politics. Pressed about this, Boko countered 
<br>that he was not a formal "political refugee" and that he was 
<br>therefore not subject to GoF control over his activities. He 
<br>did say, however, that he had informed the GoF that he would 
<br>not speak publicly about "sensitive" issues, such as the 
<br>Montoya affair or Togo's role in international drug 
<br>smuggling. He told the French that he would focus on Togo's 
<br>future and how to instill political change in a positive 
<br>manner. Boko indicated that GoF security elements provide 
<br>intermittent surveillance of his home and workplace to 
<br>protect him and his family. 
<br>
<br>RIVALRY WITH OLYMPIO? 
<br>--------------------- 
<br>¶14. (C) Boko said he did not have much contact with 
<br>Gilchrist Olympio, who seemed to want to avoid Boko and who 
<br>resented the possibility of Boko's becoming a new opposition 
<br>figure. In Boko's opinion, Olympio was past his prime and 
<br>should understand that a new generation was on the scene. It 
<br>was futile for Olympio to try to refight political battles 
<br>dating back to the 1960s, when Eyadema ousted Olympio's 
<br>father from power and may have been involved in his death. 
<br>Boko was very annoyed that after the February 4 meeting was 
<br>announced in December, Olympio a few weeks later announced a 
<br>meeting of his own, to take place at the same time and on the 
<br>same date as Boko's February 4 meeting. To Boko, this was a 
<br>ham-fisted attempt to disrupt Boko's meeting. Boko said the 
<br>Togolese community harshly criticized Olympio's announcement. 
<br>Realizing his error, Olympio had not said anything further 
<br>about holding his meeting and Boko was not sure it would take 
<br>place. Boko expected 400-500 to attend Boko's meeting. 
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) Boko also criticized Olympio for his willingness to 
<br>meet with and possibly curry favor with Faure. He noted that 
<br>Olympio seemed to go out of his way to travel to places where 
<br>he knew he would have a chance to meet with Faure. This, 
<br>Boko claimed, discredited Olympio in the eyes of the Togolese 
<br>diaspora. As a parting shot, Boko said that Olympio suffered 
<br>credibility problems because Faure was married to one of 
<br>Olympio's relatives. 
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) COMMENT: It was not clear from Boko's remarks the 
<br>extent to which he is prepared to anoint himself a leader (or 
<br>THE leader) of the Togolese opposition. He denied that he 
<br>intended to do so, speaking of his simple desire to unite the 
<br>Togolese people. Still, his own ambition did not lie deeply 
<br>below the surface of his comments, and we will try to assess 
<br>his motives as well as the degree to which the Togolese 
<br>community views him as a new leader. END COMMENT. 
<br>
<br>¶17. (SBU) BIO NOTE: Boko said he was happy working at the 
<br>law offices of Alain Feneon, where he is one of five lawyers 
<br>engaged in facilitating the work of non-African companies in 
<br>Africa. He said, however, that he was applying for one of 
<br>the four vacant vice-presidency positions at the African 
<br>Development Bank. At the same time, his French-citizen wife 
<br>was applying for a position at the EU in Brussels, which 
<br>would require commuting daily by TGV. He said he did not 
<br>know how feasible obtaining either job would be, as they 
<br>would both place strains on the Boko household, which would 
<br>be complicated by the birth of his second child within the 
<br>next few weeks. Boko said the couple also had a 
<br>nine-year-old son. 
<br>
<br>VISIT TO LAW OFFICE, COMMENTS ON CHINA 
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br>18, (C) Boko offered a tour of his law office, where we met 
<br>with the firm's head, Alain Feneon (PROTECT THROUGHOUT). The 
<br>firm is heavily engaged in providing consulting services and 
<br>legal advice to companies doing business in Africa and to a 
<br>few African groups seeking opportunities in Europe. The firm 
<br>has operated since 1978 and Feneon has been closely involved 
<br>in the OHADA project to harmonize the commercial and business 
<br>laws of several African countries. He described the 
<br>difficulties of reconciling civil and common law approaches 
<br>but stressed the great progress OHADA has made. 
<br>
<br>¶19. (C) Feneon and Boko described the appeal of Africa to 
<br>international businesses, particularly those interested in 
<br>infrastructure development and resource extraction. Boko 
<br>said he was working on several projects involving UNDP 
<br>activity in Africa and one case involving Benin and the 
<br>Millennium Challenge Corporation. Boko noted that Faure had 
<br>recently rescinded an oil contract with the Hunt Oil Co.; he 
<br>suspected that Faure would make a new deal with the Chinese. 
<br>
<br>
<br>PARIS 00000741 004.2 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>¶20. (C) Feneon said he was aware of "at least 500 Chinese 
<br>companies," most of which were state owned, seeking 
<br>opportunities in Africa. He said the Chinese were 
<br>"interested in everything." Several clients of Feneon's firm 
<br>are Chinese and he provided a brochure on the firm printed in 
<br>Chinese. Feneon described one case involving China and 
<br>Namibia. He said that Namibia had been unable to repay a 
<br>Chinese loan. The Chinese, he said, quickly told Namibia, 
<br>"don't worry about it. Just give us 5,000 passports and 
<br>residency documents." Feneon claimed that 5,000 Chinese 
<br>families were resettled in Namibia as a result and were now 
<br>engaged in any number of small and large business activities 
<br>in Namibia. Feneon commented that this kind of arrangement 
<br>helped solve two problems for the Chinese: easing population 
<br>pressures and establishing communities in Africa that could 
<br>be of use to China later. 
<br>
<br>PRESS REPORTS ON TOGO-COTE d'IVOIRE-MONTOYA 
<br>------------------------------------------- 
<br>¶21. (SBU) Paris daily Le Monde carried two articles on 
<br>January 31 concerning the investigations into the November 6, 
<br>2004, bombing incident in Cote d'Ivoire and the Togo/Montoya 
<br>connection. This followed previous Le Monde coverage 
<br>reported Ref C. One article said that Judge Raynaud's visit 
<br>to Togo in mid-January had been useful and that she obtained 
<br>numerous documents implicating Montoya, whom she reportedly 
<br>wanted to prosecute for "complicity" in the bombing. French 
<br>General Michel Masson of the French military's Directorate 
<br>for Military Intelligence reportedly confirmed Montoya's 
<br>involvement in supplying the two aircraft that did the 
<br>bombing. The article also outlines Montoya's involvement 
<br>with the Belarusian pilots/technicians (the article says 
<br>there were eight of them, whereas Boko said there were nine). 
<br>The Belarusians were reportedly released from Togolese 
<br>custody into the care of a Belarusian woman who turned out to 
<br>be Montoya's secretary. Le Monde reports that Montoya is 
<br>also under investigation by Togolese authorities. Montoya is 
<br>quoted in the article as admitting his involvement in the 
<br>affair but denying its illegality. 
<br>
<br>¶22. (U) The second Le Monde article contains statements by 
<br>the Ivoirian members of the crews of the two aircraft 
<br>involved in the bombing (both aircraft were piloted by a 
<br>Belarusian with an Ivoirian co-pilot). The Ivoirians are 
<br>quoted as saying they did not intend to attack the French 
<br>base but rather nearby hostile forces. Because of the 
<br>proximity to the base, any bombing of the French was 
<br>accidental.
