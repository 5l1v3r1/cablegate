<br>SUBJECT: DEA CHIEF OF OPERATIONS THOMAS HARRIGAN'S MEETING WITH 
<br>RUSSIAN FEDERAL DRUG CONTROL SERVICE DEPUTY DIRECTOR NIKOLAY AULOV; 
<br>GFXI-10-4001/FSKN 
<br>
<br>1.(SBU) Summary: On February 5, 2010, DEA Chief of Operations (OC) 
<br>Thomas Harrigan and DEA Regional Director (RD) Mark Destito met with 
<br>Russian Federal Drug Control Service (FSKN) Deputy Director Nikolay 
<br>Aulov in Moscow, Russia. OC Harrigan and Deputy Director Aulov 
<br>discussed the following topics: utilizing DEA's resources in 
<br>Afghanistan to target Afghan based DTOs that are sending Afghan 
<br>opiates to Russia; suggestion that the United States apply to become 
<br>a "full fledged" country member of the Central Asian Regional 
<br>Information and Coordination Center (CARICC) and the FSKN's support in this bid; increasing cooperation and conducting more joint 
<br>investigations between the DEA and FSKN on Northern Route DTOs who are trafficking in Afghan opiates, South American based DTOs that 
<br>are sending cocaine shipments to Russia, and DTOs that are involved 
<br>in the trafficking of synthetic drugs and precursor chemicals; the 
<br>exchange of drug samples for further analysis; conducting financial 
<br>investigations to identify the money movements; the emerging threat 
<br>of Iran becoming a conduit of Afghan opiates and hashish shipments 
<br>sent to Russia; and DEA and FSKN being seen as united in the eyes of 
<br>third countries, specifically Central Asian law enforcement 
<br>counterparts. It was agreed that implementation of all of these 
<br>areas of cooperation will be a benefit to both the United States and 
<br>the Russian Federation. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>2.(SBU) On February 4, 2010, OC Harrigan and RD Destito participated in the US-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission, Drug Trafficking Working Group headed by ONDCP Director Gil Kerlikowske and FSKN Director Viktor Ivanov. 
<br>
<br>3.(SBU) Subsequent to the US-Russia Bilateral Presidential 
<br>Commission, Drug Trafficking Working Group meeting, on February 5, 
<br>2010, OC Harrigan met with FSKN Deputy Director Aulov to discuss 
<br>DEA-FSKN bilateral cooperation and drug enforcement issues. Also in 
<br>attendance from FSKN were Alexander Kirushev, First Deputy Head of 
<br>Operations, Vasily Rogozin, Head of Enforcement Division, Oleg 
<br>Koryagin, Head of Financial Investigations, Inga Mayke, Deputy Head 
<br>of Enforcement, Ilya Malakhov, Deputy Head of Financial 
<br>Investigations, Alexander Kurkov, Chief Inspector of International 
<br>Cooperation Department. In attendance from DEA were RD Destito and 
<br>CA Michael Nowacoski. US Embassy Moscow/Law Enforcement Section - 
<br>Resident Legal Advisor Richard Daddario also attended this meeting. 
<br>
<br>
<br>4.(SBU) Deputy Director Aulov began by discussing the Afghan opiate 
<br>problem that the Russian Federation is facing. According to Deputy 
<br>Director Aulov, from FSKN's and the Russian Government's point of 
<br>view the trafficking of Afghan opiates and their abuse is considered 
<br>a "weapon of mass destruction" for the Russian Federation, which is 
<br>inflicting great harm to the country and its citizens. 
<br>
<br>5.(SBU) Deputy Director Aulov explained every day there are 
<br>approximately 80 to 150 drug related deaths of Russian citizens, 
<br>which can be attributed to the abuse of Afghan opiates. The FSKN is 
<br>not satisfied that last year the production of opium decreased to 
<br>approximately 6,900 metric tons. The FSKN believes that much more 
<br>can be done to decrease the opium production in Afghanistan. 
<br>According to FSKN intel, there are enough opiates in storage in 
<br>Afghanistan that can supply the demand for the next five years. 
<br>
<br>6.(SBU) The FSKN stated that Central Asian law enforcement 
<br>counterparts are not fulfilling their duties in combating the 
<br>trafficking of Afghan opiates. The FSKN provided statistics for last 
<br>year, which revealed the following: the Tajik Drug Control Agency 
<br>seized approximately 1.5 metric tons less than they did in 2008, 
<br>Kyrgyz law enforcement counterparts seized 10 times less drugs 
<br>shipments than last year, and the situation is no different for 
<br>
<br>MOSCOW 00000293 002 OF 007 
<br>
<br>
<br>Kazakh and Uzbek law enforcement counterparts. The FSKN is 
<br>disappointed with the work ethic and results of all the law 
<br>enforcement agencies in the Central Asian countries. 
<br>
<br>7.(SBU) Deputy Director Aulov requested DEA's assistance in 
<br>combating the trafficking of Afghan opiates in Russia and throughout 
<br>the region. Deputy Director Aulov echoed US Ambassador John Beyrle's statement during the US-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission, Drug Trafficking Working Group meeting that the cold war does not exist and that today calls for "a new time and new relations" 
<br>between our two countries. 
<br>
<br>8.(SBU) Deputy Director Aulov explained that the FSKN is 
<br>accomplishing a lot in combating the Afghan opiate problem but has 
<br>realized that it is impossible to tackle this problem alone and 
<br>without cooperation from other countries, including the United 
<br>States. Deputy Director Aulov stated that "Russia can't do the job 
<br>by ourselves." 
<br>
<br>9.(SBU) Deputy Director Aulov's personal opinion is that DEA is 
<br>highly respected and influential throughout the world wide law 
<br>enforcement community. This opinion is also shared throughout the 
<br>FSKN. The FSKN hopes that DEA can use its influence in Afghanistan 
<br>and Central Asia to curb the Afghan drug problem. 
<br>
<br>10.(SBU) Deputy Director Aulov identified the following areas of 
<br>cooperation that the FSKN is interested in conducting with the DEA: 
<br>
<br>Utilizing DEA's resources and capabilities in Afghanistan to target 
<br>Afghan based DTOs. FSKN would like a concentrated effort on 
<br>conducting joint investigations with the DEA on Northern Route DTOs 
<br>and targeting the Afghan based sources of supply. Deputy Director 
<br>Aulov identified the Moscow CO-FSKN joint investigation of the 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>
<br>MOSCOW 00000293 003 OF 007 
<br>
<br>
<br>The FSKN suggested as a method to target Afghan based sources and 
<br>Russian based recipients that the DEA and FSKN attempt to conduct 
<br>International Controlled Deliveries (ICDs) to Russia. 
<br>
<br>In an attempt to effectively target Afghan based sources of supply 
<br>and Northern Route DTOs, the FSKN proposed that the United States 
<br>become a "full fledged" country member of the CARICC. Deputy 
<br>Director Aulov proposed that the FSKN would not only support the 
<br>United States' bid to become an "observer" country member with 
<br>CARICC but would support the United States' bid to become a "full 
<br>fledged" country member of CARICC. 
<br>
<br>FSKN also places an emphasis on targeting DTOs that are sending 
<br>cocaine shipments to the Russian Federation. Deputy Director Aulov 
<br>stated that during last year, the FSKN seized five times the amount 
<br>of cocaine than the previous year. The FSKN believes that cocaine 
<br>trafficking will continue to increase in the future due to the 
<br>lucrative Russian market. The average price for a kilogram of 
<br>cocaine in Russia is approximately $60,000 to $100,000 USD per 
<br>kilogram. XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>
<br>Agent's Note: On February 3, 2010, FSKN Director Ivanov was on 
<br>Russian TV and in the Russian press discussing the DEA-FSKN 
<br>relationship and thanked the DEA's assistance in the above mentioned 
<br>SHEFATOV investigation, which led to its successful outcome. 
<br>
<br>The FSKN requested to utilize DEA's resources and capabilities in 
<br>South America and the Caribbean to target DTOs that are sending 
<br>cocaine shipments to Russia. Director Aulov proposed conducting new 
<br>joint cocaine investigations with the DEA to include a DTO that is 
<br>sending cocaine shipments from Brazil to Russia. 
<br>
<br>Another area of joint cooperation that the FSKN would like to 
<br>develop with the DEA is on targeting DTOs that are engage in the 
<br>trafficking of synthetic drugs and precursor 
<br>chemicals. The FSKN requested the DEA to provide information on the 
<br>seizures of acetic anhydride (AA) shipments in Afghanistan and the 
<br>subsequent results of the chemical analysis that may allow the 
<br>identification of the source countries. 
<br>
<br>Due to recent changes in Russian legislation, the FSKN is now 
<br>allowed to exchange drug samples with foreign counterparts for 
<br>further analysis. Deputy Director Aulov proposed the exchange of the 
<br>results of the chemical analysis on the seized drugs for further 
<br>comparative studies. Deputy Director Aulov also suggested the 
<br>exchange of DEA and FSKN chemists in an attempt to learn new 
<br>techniques and ideas from each other when analyzing drug samples. 
<br>
<br>The FSKN is interested in conducting joint financial investigations 
<br>with the DEA. The FSKN is very interested in starting the joint 
<br>mapping exercise with the DEA to identify money movements and to 
<br>share financial intel to target key narcotics traffickers. The US 
<br>Treasury Department and Russian Financial Monitoring Service 
<br>(Rosfinmonitoring Service) are currently finalizing the Terms of 
<br>Reference (TOR) to start sharing financial information between the 
<br>two agencies. 
<br>
<br>
<br>MOSCOW 00000293 004 OF 007 
<br>
<br>
<br>Agent's Note: A new trend that FSKN in seeing is that drug proceeds 
<br>are now being sent directly to Afghanistan instead of being sent to 
<br>third countries (i.e. UAE, Europe, and Central Asia). During the 
<br>US-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission, Drug Trafficking 
<br>Working Group meeting, Deputy Director Aulov presented a PowerPoint 
<br>presentation XXXXXXXXXXXX. 
<br>Deputy Director Aulov supplied a hard copy of his PowerPoint 
<br>Presentation to OC Harrigan. This hard copy is written in the 
<br>Russian language. The Moscow CO will translate the hard copy into 
<br>the English language. 
<br>
<br>Another emerging threat that the FSKN has identified is Afghan 
<br>based DTOs utilizing Iran as a conduit to ship large shipments of 
<br>Afghan opiates and hashish to Russia via Azerbaijan and the Caspian 
<br>Sea. According to FSKN intel, more and more DTOs are now using 
<br>Azerbaijan and Caspian seaports to ship large opiate and hashish 
<br>shipments to Russia due to the lack of enforcement and inspections 
<br>in these areas. To combat this problem the FSKN is attempting to 
<br>develop better working relationships with Azeri law enforcement 
<br>counterparts. As of right now, the FSKN has limited engagement with 
<br>Iranian law enforcement counterparts. The FSKN knows that the US 
<br>Government and the DEA does not have any relationship with the 
<br>Iranian Government or Iranian law enforcement counterparts. The FSKN 
<br>proposed on sharing Iranian intel with the DEA and vice versa to 
<br>fill the intelligence gaps that each agency has related to Iran. 
<br>
<br>The FSKN would like to be seen united with the DEA in the eyes of 
<br>Central Asian law enforcement counterparts. The FSKN believes that 
<br>if Central Asian counterparts see the DEA and FSKN united they will 
<br>not be able to play off both countries as they have in the past. As 
<br>noted above, the FSKN is very dissatisfied with the counter 
<br>narcotics effort of Central Asian counterparts. The FSKN believes if 
<br>these Central Asian counterparts see the DEA and FSKN proactively 
<br>engaging in joint Northern Route investigations and sitting side by 
<br>side with each in the CARICC this would send a loud and clear signal 
<br>that the Afghan drug problem is a major issue for both the United 
<br>States and the Russian Federation and that their lack of effort will 
<br>not be tolerated. 
<br>
<br>11.(SBU) OC Harrigan responded to Deputy Director Aulov's comments 
<br>that DEA's main focus in this region is Afghanistan and that the DEA 
<br>would assist the FSKN in every possible way to target the Afghan 
<br>based sources of supply. OC Harrigan stated that any intel that is 
<br>developed or obtained that could be shared with the FSKN would be 
<br>shared with them. 
<br>
<br>12.(SBU) OC Harrigan provided a briefing on DEA's operations and 
<br>assets that are in Afghanistan. OC Harrigan stated that he would 
<br>provide the FSKN with a written summary in the Russian language of 
<br>DEA's current operations and staff levels in Afghanistan via the 
<br>Moscow CO. 
<br>
<br>13.(SBU) OC Harrigan reported that he may travel to Afghanistan in 
<br>or about March and during this visit would attempt to personally 
<br>meet with XXXXXXXXXXXX 
<br>who is FSKN's liaison officer based in Kabul, Afghanistan. 
<br>
<br>14.(SBU) OC Harrigan explained that DEA's main mission is to target 
<br>the key individuals who are the "command and control" for the major 
<br>DTOs. DEA utilizes world wide assets in an attempt to disrupt and 
<br>dismantle DTOs by arresting and prosecuting the "high value targets" 
<br>of the DTOs. 
<br>
<br>15.(SBU) OC Harrigan handed Deputy Director Aulov with a target 
<br>package that contains eight Afghan DTOs that were cleared by the 
<br>
<br>MOSCOW 00000293 005 OF 007 
<br>
<br>
<br>Kabul CO to pass to the FSKN. OC Harrigan requested the FSKN to 
<br>conduct a search in their databases on these DTOs in an attempt to 
<br>determine if the FSKN has any intel on these DTOs. OC Harrigan 
<br>proposed conducting joint investigations with the FSKN on these 
<br>targets. 
<br>
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX 
<br>
<br>16.(SBU) OC Harrigan advised that the DEA conducted an extensive 
<br>search on the booklet that was provided by the FSKN that contained 
<br>the 175 heroin markings and logos but the search was negative. OC 
<br>Harrigan explained that the DEA does not seize significant 
<br>quantities of Southwest Asian heroin in the United States and thus 
<br>does not have a detailed database. OC Harrigan thanked the FSKN in 
<br>providing this booklet and requested the FSKN to continue to provide 
<br>details on heroin seizures to include, dates, locations, amounts, 
<br>markings, and logos so that the database could be enlarged. OC 
<br>Harrigan stated that the Moscow CO would translate the results of 
<br>DEA's search on the heroin markings and logos into the Russian 
<br>language so that it could be passed to the FSKN. 
<br>
<br>17.(SBU) OC Harrigan briefed the FSKN on DEA's operations in Africa 
<br>including information on Colombian DTOs who are establishing a 
<br>presence in West Africa. These Colombian DTOs are receiving plane 
<br>loads of cocaine shipments from Venezuela and Brazil for further 
<br>distribution to Europe and possibly to Russia. 
<br>
<br>18.(SBU) OC Harrigan identified that the DEA has offices in the 
<br>following African countries: Lagos, Nigeria, Cairo, Egypt, Pretoria, 
<br>South Africa, and Accra, Ghana but the DEA is quickly developing a 
<br>close working cooperation with the respective host country 
<br>counterparts. As an example, OC Harrigan described the recent joint 
<br>investigation between the DEA and Ghana counterparts that led to the 
<br>arrest and the extradition of three Al-Qaeda associates who were 
<br>involved in cocaine trafficking to the United States for 
<br>prosecution. 
<br>
<br>19.(SBU) OC Harrigan also provided a briefing on Hezbollah's 
<br>presence in East Africa and their activities in trafficking in 
<br>precursor chemicals. OC Harrigan related that more DTOs are now 
<br>involved in narco-terrorism activities. 
<br>
<br>20.(SBU) OC Harrigan agreed with all of Deputy Director Aulov's 
<br>proposals and is very interested in DEA and FSKN fostering closer 
<br>working relationships and conducting numerous other "joint" 
<br>investigations. 
<br>
<br>21.(SBU) During the meeting, RD Destito provided a briefing on DEA's 
<br>operations and presence in Central Asia. 
<br>
<br>22.(SBU) RD Destito explained that the Dushanbe CO is working joint 
<br>investigations with the Tajik Drug Control Agency, the Tajik MVD, 
<br>and the Tajik Border Guard Services. RD Destito described the 
<br>working cooperation with Tajik counterparts is difficult due to 
<br>corruption issues. 
<br>
<br>23.(SBU) RD Destito advised that DEA has recently re-opened the 
<br>Tashkent CO and that the DEA is now allowed to work with the 
<br>previous Uzbek SIU unit. 
<br>
<br>24.(SBU) RD Destito discussed the status of opening of the Almaty 
<br>CO, which will cover Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and work directly with 
<br>
<br>MOSCOW 00000293 006 OF 007 
<br>
<br>
<br>the CARICC. RD Destito used the SECI Center as an example of how the CARRIC could be utilized in counter narcotics investigations. RD 
<br>Destito explained that in the beginning the SECI Center encountered 
<br>difficulties Since then, the SECI has been provided outstanding 
<br>contributions to joint multi lateral investigations. RD Destito 
<br>described the recent seizure of a ton of cocaine made by Romanian 
<br>counterparts, which was then shared with the SECI Center. The SECI 
<br>Center was able to provide timely intel that resulted in the seizure 
<br>of an additional 3.5 metric tons of cocaine in Brazil. RD Destito 
<br>believes that the CARICC will be able to follow in the foot steps of 
<br>the SECI Center in providing quality case support. 
<br>
<br>25.(SBU) Both OC Harrigan and RD Destito thanked the FSKN for its 
<br>suggestion on supporting the United States on becoming a "full 
<br>fledged" country member of the CARRIC instead of an "observer" 
<br>country member. 
<br>
<br>26.(SBU) RD Destito explained his disappointment with the 
<br>disbandment of the Kyrgyz Drug Control Agency (KDCA) and that this 
<br>will be a set back for the entire region on curbing the flow of 
<br>Afghan opiates. RD Destito stated that the DEA is waiting on the 
<br>final decision from the Kyrgyz Government on the reorganization of 
<br>the Kyrgyz Ministry of the Interior (MVD). RD Destito suggested that 
<br>both the DEA and FSKN should be on "same page" when dealing with the Kyrgyz Government. 
<br>
<br>27.(SBU) RD Destito provided a briefing on DEA's operations in 
<br>Turkmenistan and the previous DEA TDY assignments in that country. 
<br>RD Destito explained that the newly established Turkmen Drug Control 
<br>Agency (DCA) needs international support and proposed that FSKN 
<br>provide assistance in joint NATO-Russian Training for the Turkmen 
<br>DCA. 
<br>
<br>¶28. (SBU) Both OC Harrigan and RD Destito proposed that FSKN liaison officers who are posted in Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan meet with the respective DEA agents who are or who will be posted to those countries in an attempt strength the relationship 
<br>between the DEA and FSKN and to show Central Asian counterparts that the DEA and FSKN are committed in working together in a common goal on disrupting and dismantling Northern Route DTOs. Deputy Director Aulov agreed with this proposal but added that the high level of corruption that are involved in those countries can not be 
<br>dismissed. 
<br>
<br>29.(SBU) At the end of the meeting, Deputy Director Aulov allowed 
<br>General Alexander Kirushev and General Vasily Rogozin to provide 
<br>comments. 
<br>
<br>30.(SBU) General Kirushev stated that the FSKN has agreed to allow 
<br>the Moscow CO to work directly with regional FSKN offices and not 
<br>just FSKN Headquarter sections. The FSKN is in the process of 
<br>analyzing seven additional investigations that could be proposed as 
<br>joint investigations to be conducted with the Moscow CO. 
<br>
<br>31.(SBU) General Kirushev requested that since Afghan sources of 
<br>supply are not in direct contact with Russian based DTOs, if the DEA 
<br>would be able to provide identified Afghan and other Central Asian 
<br>telephone numbers that could then be used to identify Russian 
<br>telephone numbers. Lastly, General Kirushev explained that since the 
<br>break up of the Soviet Union, there are a lot of Russian nationals 
<br>who are residing world wide who may be involved in shipping drug 
<br>shipments to Russia. General Kirushev requested that the DEA share 
<br>intel developed or obtained on any Russian nationals who are 
<br>involved in shipping drug shipments to Russia. 
<br>
<br>
<br>MOSCOW 00000293 007 OF 007 
<br>
<br>
<br>32.(SBU) General Rogozin stated that the FSKN is closely working 
<br>with the Kyrgyz MVD since the disbandment of the KDCA. General 
<br>Rogozin explained that the Kyrgyz MVD does not have a lot of funds 
<br>and that the FSKN pays for all the costs related to any ICDs that 
<br>the FSKN works with the Kyrgyz MVD. 
<br>
<br>33.(SBU) This meeting confirmed the trend that the Moscow CO has 
<br>noticed over the last several months with FSKN's cooperation and 
<br>their willingness to conduct joint investigations. Recently the 
<br>Moscow CO and the FSKN has been conducting weekly meetings with each other. These meetings resulted in the following: FSKN providing a 
<br>list of 11 Afghan targets that are based in Afghanistan and who are 
<br>involved in heroin trafficking, the proposal of conducting two new 
<br>joint investigations, XXXXXXXXXXXX, and their eagerness 
<br>to meet with Moscow CO agents on short notice and at the US Embassy.
<br> 
<br>The Moscow CO believes that one of the main items to come out of the 
<br>meeting between OC Harrigan and Deputy Director Aulov is FSKN's 
<br>initiative to support the United States in a bid to join the CARICC 
<br>as a "full fledged" country member. The Moscow CO will continue its 
<br>effort to strengthen the relationship with the FSKN in an attempt to 
<br>make the relationship more open and productive in conducting quality 
<br>joint investigations.
