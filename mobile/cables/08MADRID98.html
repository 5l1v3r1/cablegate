<br>SUBJECT: CODEL MARTINEZ JANUARY 10-11 VISIT TO MADRID
<br>
<br>¶1. (U) Summary: Codel Martinez had a busy and productive
<br>visit to Madrid January 10-11, 2008, meeting with the Prince
<br>of Asturias, Popular Party (PP) presidential candidate
<br>Mariano Rajoy, National Security Advisor Carles Casajuana
<br>(septel), former President Aznar, Foreign Minister Moratinos
<br>(septel), and Cuban dissidents Hector Palacios and Gisela
<br>Delgado. The Ambassador accompanied Senator Martinez in all
<br>of his meetings. Codel Martinez also attended a lunch
<br>organized by the American Chamber of Commerce where
<br>discussion focused on renewable energy and a dinner with the
<br>U.S.-Spain Council hosted by the Ambassador. In addition,
<br>Senator Martinez gave an interview to El Pais newspaper.
<br>Senators Grassley and Thune met with a senior official at the
<br>Ministry of Industry, Tourism, and Trade to discuss U.S. pork
<br>exports. End Summary.
<br>
<br>Prince of Asturias
<br>------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) Shortly after their arrival January 10, Senators
<br>Martinez, Grassley, Thune, and Craig were received by the
<br>Prince of Asturias at Zarzuela Palace. The Prince stressed
<br>the importance for Spain of maintaining excellent relations
<br>with the U.S. and his commitment to improving those
<br>relations. The Prince reminisced happily about his travels
<br>in the U.S. and expressed a great fondness for the country.
<br>He had clearly been following the U.S. Presidential primaries
<br>and sought the Senators' views on the process.
<br>
<br>Mariano Rajoy
<br>-------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) The delegation met at PP headquarters with
<br>presidential candidate Mariano Rajoy. Rajoy noted that with
<br>less than two months to go before the Spanish general
<br>elections, the polls showed him in a tie with Zapatero and
<br>his Spanish Socialist Workers, Party (PSOE). Rajoy said his
<br>campaign would focus on the economy, nationalism, and
<br>terrorism. On the economy, he said polls showed it to be the
<br>number one issue. Rajoy said Zapatero had lived for four
<br>years off the inheritance of the previous PP,s government's
<br>good economic management. Rajoy said the macroeconomic
<br>indicators were still good, but people were beginning to feel
<br>the pinch of inflation running above the EU average. He also
<br>said interest rates were rising, a serious worry in a nation
<br>of 44 million with eight million mortgages. Rajoy said
<br>Zapatero had not defended Spain, the oldest national identity
<br>in Europe, from the demands of radical regional groups with
<br>nationalistic aspirations. On terrorism, Rajoy contrasted PP
<br>firmness with Zapatero,s attempt to negotiate with ETA.
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) In foreign policy, Rajoy said he would defend
<br>democracy, freedom, human rights, and Western values. He
<br>said Spain (and Europe) needed the best possible relationship
<br>with the U.S. Rajoy noted Spain had once been a reliable
<br>ally of the U.S. He promised that as President he would
<br>speak his mind and avoid surprises. Rajoy said Spain should
<br>play a significant role in Latin America and should promote
<br>democracy, freedom, and human rights in the region, which was
<br>suffering some unacceptable leaders at the moment. He said
<br>the PP position regarding Venezuela was well known: populism
<br>was not the direction the people of Latin America were
<br>moving. He expressed strong disagreement with Zapatero,s
<br>Cuba policy and voiced concern over treatment of dissidents
<br>in Cuba. Rajoy noted Spain,s position on Cuba was important
<br>within the EU. Rajoy insisted he would fulfill Spain,s
<br>commitments abroad, which would be in defense of Western
<br>values. He said it was difficult but the public would
<br>understand the need for overseas engagement if the problems
<br>were explained to them. He said Spain would continue in
<br>Afghanistan, and noted the while in opposition the PP had
<br>supported sending troops abroad. Rajoy said the PP opposed
<br>Spain,s 2004 withdrawal from Iraq, which he characterized as
<br>a mistake, albeit one that won the PSOE votes.
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) Although he did not indicate he would make it a
<br>campaign issue, Rajoy noted Spain was number two in the world
<br>behind the U.S. in terms of the numbers of immigrants
<br>received. Over ten percent of the population was of foreign
<br>origin, and there was a large Muslim immigrant population.
<br>He said immigration was beginning to cause problems, as
<br>ordinary Spaniards saw their access to social services
<br>affected (he mentioned public health was 40 percent of
<br>Spain,s budget). He said the PP was against illegal
<br>immigration and in favor of orderly migration flows. He
<br>condemned Zapatero,s amnesty for nearly one million illegal
<br>immigrants, saying it had drawn new immigrants and noted that
<br>migratory pressures from Africa were only increasing.
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) Rajoy mentioned that while Minister of Interior he
<br>was the first European minister to visit the U.S. after the
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000098 002 OF 005
<br>
<br>
<br>9/11 attacks. He said the West needed to invest more
<br>resources in educating people about democratic values. He
<br>criticized the Zapatero government,s Alliance of
<br>Civilizations (AOC) effort, saying it was an electoral ploy.
<br>He said the left wing in Spain and elsewhere tried to use the
<br>popular media and entertainment figures to convince people
<br>that they favored peace while center right parties such as
<br>the PP in Spain favored war. He said this had to be
<br>countered through education.
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) Asked about voter turnout, Rajoy said this was a big
<br>unknown. He said in 2000 the PP won an absolute majority in
<br>Congress. In 2004, they lost by about five percent because
<br>Zapatero was able to mobilize socialist voters using the Iraq
<br>war and the Atocha bombings. He characterized 2004 as a vote
<br>against the PP rather than for the PSOE. Rajoy predicted the
<br>anti-PP vote would not be there this year. He said the PP
<br>base was very loyal and would vote, so the question was many
<br>socialist actually turned out. He noted in 2004 polls should
<br>him eight points ahead the day of the Atocha bombings, and he
<br>lost by five points the following Sunday. Rajoy noted that
<br>the polls in the 2007 municipal elections predicted PP
<br>defeat. In fact, the PP won. He said turnout and loyalty
<br>were key. He claimed polls showed 85 percent of PP voters
<br>were loyal but only 72 percent of PSOE voters. He said his
<br>strategy was to reach out to the center and the opposition
<br>rather than to his base. He said this was to avoid
<br>mobilizing the PSOE base and increasing their turnout. Rajoy
<br>mentioned that convincing the media which supported the PP to
<br>avoid antagonizing the left was a challenge. Noting he had
<br>been campaign manager both times, he noted Aznar,s 1996
<br>campaign was aggressive whereas in the even more successful
<br>2000 campaign the PP had behaved like nuns. Rajoy said the
<br>costs of campaigning in Spain were negligible compared to the
<br>U.S. He said in Spain, as opposed to the U.S., it was
<br>important not to let people know how much money you had
<br>raised since voters would turn against the candidate with the
<br>most money. He noted the parties were prohibited from buying
<br>advertising until the last two weeks, and so they had to earn
<br>media coverage in the meantime and were heavily focused on
<br>the internet, which he said was the only way to reach young
<br>voters. He said the party was commissioning two polls a
<br>month and would move to daily polling in the last two weeks
<br>(Rajoy joked that after long and intensive study of the
<br>science of polling he had concluded he knew nothing about
<br>polls). He said most of the PP money would be spent on radio
<br>and billboard advertising. He noted he was on the trail four
<br>out of every seven days. Rajoy said the debates, scheduled
<br>for February 25 and March 3, could be decisive since they
<br>came so late in the process. He mentioned that the PP was
<br>also hitting family issues, noting the PSOE favored gay
<br>marriage. Rajoy said there were 1.5 million absentee voters,
<br>a number he said was significant in terms of the Spanish
<br>electorate. He recalled that in a recent election the PP had
<br>lost a seat in Galicia because Hugo Chavez had sequestered
<br>the mail from Venezuela, which Rajoy was sure contained a
<br>heavy PP vote since Spaniards there were unhappy with the
<br>PSOE,s failure to stand up to Chavez. Rajoy mentioned the
<br>PP had an office in Washington and their representative there
<br>was part of the party,s governing committee. He also sought
<br>the Senators, views on the U.S. Presidential campaign.
<br>
<br>Jose Maria Aznar
<br>----------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU) On January 11 CODEL Martinez held a wide-ranging
<br>discussion with former Spanish President Jose Maria Aznar
<br>that touched on the electoral outlook in Spain and the U.S.,
<br>as well as Aznar,s strong opinions on Kosovo, Turkey, and
<br>the Alliance of Civilizations. President Aznar told the
<br>CODEL that he held real reservations about Kosovo's
<br>independence, concerns he mentioned he had conveyed to
<br>Senator Lieberman the night before. Aznar said he believed
<br>international acceptance of a unilateral declaration of
<br>independence (UDI) would lead to three undesirable results:
<br>the de facto acceptance of changed borders in Europe as a
<br>consequence of "blackmail;" the establishment of a principle
<br>of self-determination that would have ramifications in Spain,
<br>Italy, Turkey, Iraq, and other states with minority
<br>populations; and the rise of nationalism on the European
<br>continent. Aznar said he feared the explosive mixture of
<br>nationalism and changing borders and would prefer Kosovo
<br>remain a protectorate for the next century rather than have a
<br>UDI be accepted by much of the international community.
<br>
<br>¶9. (SBU) Aznar opined that Turkey's EU bid was impossible at
<br>present and would continue to be so for perhaps the next 15
<br>years. The former president said that while Europe should
<br>certainly look to forge and maintain a special relationship
<br>with Turkey, it was hard for him to imagine a Muslim-majority
<br>country fitting into a Europe of Christian roots. He said
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000098 003 OF 005
<br>
<br>
<br>that EU and U.S. leaders needed to consider just what the
<br>Turkey factor would mean to Europe with the addition of 100
<br>million Muslims.
<br>
<br>¶10. (SBU) Aznar voiced skepticism regarding the AOC. He said
<br>during his term in office he visited Iran and worked closely
<br>with former Iranian President Khatemi to establish a dialogue
<br>of civilizations, but that he could not see the desirability
<br>or feasibility of forming an alliance with figures such as
<br>Supreme Leader Khamenei. Aznar said that the AOC was not in
<br>the best interests of the West. He mentioned that he
<br>maintains good relations with Turkish President Erdogan and
<br>claimed to have it on good authority that Erdogan was taking
<br>an active role in Zapatero,s AOC not because he necessarily
<br>believed in it, but because he hoped it would help Turkey,s
<br>EU bid.
<br>
<br>¶11. (SBU) Aznar concluded the meeting with a discussion of
<br>the role of his think tank, the Foundation for Social
<br>Analysis and Studies (FAES). He said that FAES was set up in
<br>the European liberal tradition and was intended to defend the
<br>values of the western world and an Atlantic policy. FAES
<br>seeks to strengthen the U.S.-EU pillar and believes that an
<br>Atlantic Europe is the only possibility for the continent.
<br>
<br>Renewable Energy
<br>----------------
<br>
<br>¶12. (U) At a lunch on renewable energy hosted by the
<br>American Chamber of Commerce, the Senators and Spanish
<br>companies discussed the status of several forms of renewable
<br>and low-emission energy. Ambassador Aguirre and AmCham
<br>president Jaime Malet opened with remarks describing Spanish
<br>and U.S. leadership in the sector and emphasizing the amount
<br>of Spanish investment in renewables projects in the U.S.
<br>Ambassador Aguirre described the February renewable energy
<br>trade and investment mission post is organizing with the GOS
<br>to bring Spanish government officials and companies to the
<br>U.S. Senators Grassley and Thune discussed biofuels, which
<br>Senator Grassley noted were likely to shift away from the
<br>present emphasis on corn-based ethanol to cellulose-based
<br>ethanol after the next 5-10 years. Senators Grassley and
<br>Thune explained their states, favorable location for wind
<br>power (Iowa has Spanish investment in both wind farms and a
<br>wind turbine manufacturing plant), while Senator Martinez
<br>noted that the U.S., geographic variability meant that an
<br>identical national renewable portfolio standard for each
<br>state would be unfair to states such as Florida that lacked
<br>commercially viable quantities of wind. Senator Craig and
<br>Ambassador Aguirre emphasized the importance of technological
<br>advances in addressing energy dependence and climate change.
<br>Senator Craig described U.S. climate change policy, outlined
<br>the U.S. national energy laboratories, role in technological
<br>research, and reviewed issues related to nuclear and clean
<br>coal technology. Spanish company representatives described
<br>Spain,s system of incentives for electricity from renewable
<br>sources (Spain,s system is based on guaranteed prices, while
<br>U.S. incentives are mainly tax-related) and expressed
<br>interest in investment opportunities in the U.S. in
<br>electricity transmission as well as generation. Participants
<br>from both countries emphasized the importance of encouraging
<br>renewable energy as an alternative to dependence upon
<br>hydrocarbon imports from undemocratic suppliers.
<br>
<br>Cuban Dissidents
<br>----------------
<br>
<br>¶13. (SBU) Senators Martinez and Craig, joined by the
<br>Ambassador and Deputy Chief of Mission, met January 11 with
<br>Cuban dissidents Hector Palacios and his wife Gisela Delgado.
<br>Palacios briefed the Senators on his personal situation
<br>saying he had been released from jail at the petition of the
<br>Spanish Government in order to come to Spain to receive
<br>medical treatment. While appreciated Spain,s help, he did
<br>not agree with Spain,s policy of engagement with the Cuban
<br>regime or with gestures such as the 2007 Moratinos visit to
<br>Cuba. He said he and his wife had made public statements
<br>critical of Spanish policy and as a result the Spanish had
<br>cut his per diem allowance and moved him to a cheaper hotel.
<br>He said Moratinos had not seen him and instead he dealt with
<br>the Director General for Iberoamerica.
<br>
<br>¶14. (SBU) Palacios said political control in Cuba was
<br>fragmenting into three or four different groups. Fidel had
<br>been the glue that held it together. Each group had a
<br>somewhat different agenda their common goal was to stay in
<br>power. Palacios said Cuba was ripe for change. He said the
<br>military would not be a major obstacle once change began
<br>because conscription meant that the military reflected the
<br>people. Also, Fidel,s policy of rotating troops regularly
<br>underneath their officers had had its intended effect of
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000098 004 OF 005
<br>
<br>
<br>preventing the formation of units personally loyal to their
<br>commanders. He said a greater problem would the large system
<br>of repression Fidel had created (the Ministry of Interior,
<br>neighborhood committees, bands of thugs who attacked and
<br>intimidated dissidents). There were about 200,000 people in
<br>this system and they were the ones who lived well and who had
<br>a great deal to lose. Even those within government would
<br>find these people a formidable obstacle if they tried to
<br>promote change.
<br>
<br>¶15. (SBU) Palacios said U.S. assistance was not reaching the
<br>dissidents. He noted the irony of being jailed as an agent
<br>of U.S. imperialism when the actual amount of USG funding was
<br>minimal. He said they ran into problems doing things as
<br>simple as finding the small amounts of money needed to bring
<br>dissidents from one part of the island to another to attend
<br>demonstrations. He said he planned to travel to Washington
<br>and Miami soon and intended to raise this issue in both
<br>places.
<br>
<br>National Security Advisor Casajuana and Foreign Minister
<br>Moratinos
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- -----------------
<br>
<br>¶16. (SBU) Senators Martinez and Craig (joined by Senator
<br>Lieberman) met January 11 with Carles Casajuana and discussed
<br>Afghanistan, Lebanon, Morocco, Cuba, and the AOC. Also on
<br>January 11, Codel Martinez met with FM Moratinos where the
<br>conversation touched on Afghanistan, the Middle East peace
<br>process, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba, and the AOC. Both meetings
<br>are reported via septels.
<br>
<br>Agricultural Trade Issues
<br>-------------------------
<br>
<br>¶17. (SBU) On January 11, Senators Charles Grassley and John
<br>Thune, together with the Deputy Chief of Mission, AgCouns and
<br>EconOff, met with the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and
<br>Trade,s Secretary of State for International Trade, Pedro
<br>Mejia, and Secretary General Alfredo Bonet. Senator Grassley
<br>emphasized the importance of science-based decisions in the
<br>agricultural biotechnology context. Mejia said that Spain
<br>had a relatively "liberal" view with respect to
<br>biotechnology. However, even in Spain the technology was
<br>controversial and faced NGO opposition, albeit not as strong
<br>as in some other EU member states. Senator Thune asked what
<br>influence Spain could exercise in Brussels on this issue.
<br>Bonet noted it was very difficult to get a qualified majority
<br>for biotech approvals in the EU Environment Council so in the
<br>end the Commission was taking decisions in favor of
<br>biotechnology. Both Mejia and Bonet noted that commodity
<br>price hikes might spur greater liberalization on biotech
<br>imports. The Secretary of State asked about the status of
<br>the proposed elimination of the "splash and dash" tax credit
<br>loophole that allows biodiesel producers in the U.S. to
<br>import commodities such as soybeans, add a minimal amount of
<br>petroleum diesel, and then reexport the biodiesel. European
<br>producers have complained about these imports. The Senator
<br>promised to get back to the Secretary of State on the status
<br>of the proposed elimination of the loophole. Mejia said that
<br>he was pessimistic about the prospects for Doha because major
<br>developing countries were not willing to give sufficiently in
<br>terms of industrial and services market access; he emphasized
<br>especially Spain,s interest in better services access. He
<br>noted also that with high agricultural commodity prices, some
<br>developing countries now did not see why they should give on
<br>industrial goods and services access. He said that the U.S.
<br>was still under pressure to do more on domestic agricultural
<br>support. Spain's senior trade representative asserted that
<br>the EU had made a good agricultural access offer. The
<br>Senators expressed support for Doha but were pessimistic
<br>about getting support for Trade Promotion Authority (TPA)
<br>this year. Finally, there was a lively discussion of
<br>Secretary of State Mejia's February energy renewables trip to
<br>
<br>SIPDIS
<br>the U.S. Both Senators Grassley and Thune were very
<br>interested in the mission. (Comment: This was a very good
<br>substantive discussion. However, it is clear that while
<br>Spain will continue sometimes to vote in favor of
<br>biotechnology liberalization proposals, the Spaniards will
<br>tread warily on this issue given their own domestic
<br>sensitivities and other equities Spain has in the EU. It was
<br>interesting to hear Mejia,s strong emphasis on services as
<br>the future of Spain,s economy. Unfortunately, Spanish
<br>services companies have not been aggressive in promoting
<br>Doha, although this is true of many other services companies
<br>in Europe as well. End comment.)
<br>Press Coverage
<br>--------------
<br>
<br>¶18. (U) ABC, EFE, Europa Press, and El Pais reported on the
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000098 005 OF 005
<br>
<br>
<br>visit. El Pais published January 14 an interview with
<br>Senator Martinez focused on the U.S. elections, the Middle
<br>East peace process, and the need for democratic change in
<br>Cuba.
<br>
<br>¶19. (U) Senator Martinez cleared this cable.
