<br>SUBJECT: NEW CHINA CREDIT LINE UNDER CONSIDERATION 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Dan Mozena for Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: During a January 23 call by Ambassador 
<br>Mozena, Chinese Ambassador Bolum Zhang said negotiations will 
<br>soon begin between China and Angola for a new loan package 
<br>valued in the USD "multiple single digit billions." Zhang 
<br>said the new agreement will not be backed by oil, but should 
<br>receive a sovereign guarantee from the GRA. Zhang distanced 
<br>himself from the "private" China International Fund, which 
<br>has weak management and poor leadership in Angola, despite 
<br>its close links to the Angolan presidency. Zhang expressed 
<br>considerable interest in working with the USG on a bilateral 
<br>development assistance project in Angola. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Background: In a wide ranging and open conversation 
<br>with Ambassador Mozena, Ambassador Zhang said President Dos 
<br>Santos's December visit to China opened new channels for 
<br>political dialogue to build mutual trust and understanding. 
<br>Zhang said China supports Angola's reconstruction efforts and 
<br>is providing technology, equipment, and communications 
<br>infrastructure through government-to-government oil-backed 
<br>loans, some grants, and company-to-country business deals. 
<br>In discussions with Chinese leaders, including Ambassador 
<br>Zhang, senior GRA officials have made clear that Angola 
<br>requires over USD 12 billion in additional loans to meet its 
<br>short term development goals. Zhang said a 2003 decision by 
<br>the GOC to cap the value of Chinese loans to Africa at USD 10 
<br>billion likely means China will be unable to meet the GRA 
<br>requests, as Chinese Ex-Im debt in Angola alone is USD 4.5 
<br>billion (2.5 billion expended, 2 billion still available). 
<br>Zhang said China's rights to Angolan oil (as a result of the 
<br>oil-backed loans extended to the GRA) represented less than 
<br>200 million barrels of oil in 2008, with most of the crude 
<br>coming from a Block 18 contract among the CIF, Sinopec, and 
<br>BP. Zhang said Sinopec ships Block 18 oil directly to China, 
<br>rather than trading it on the open market, though China pays 
<br>the prevailing market price. 
<br>
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br>Negotiations Toward a New Loan Package 
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Zhang said Dos Santos discussed a new loan package for 
<br>Angola during his December 16-19 trip to China. Zhang said 
<br>that while negotiations have not yet begun, it was clear that 
<br>these loans would not be backed by Angola's oil reserves as 
<br>that would be "too humiliating" for the Angolans. Zhang said 
<br>that while the Chinese Ex-Im Bank is taking the lead on 
<br>negotiations with Angola on the loan package, the funds would 
<br>be made available through credit extended by private Chinese 
<br>banks, similar to a government-coordinated investment fund. 
<br>Zhang said the structure of the loans and the interest rate 
<br>would be the key points in negotiations. He added that he 
<br>hoped Angola would offer a sovereign guarantee to help make 
<br>the loans more appealing to investors. When asked the total 
<br>value of the proposed package, Zhang said it would be in the 
<br>USD "multiple single digit billions." Zhang said few details 
<br>would be released about the plan during the bilateral 
<br>negotiations, but the program would be completely transparent 
<br>when finished and announced to the press. Zhang said it is 
<br>likely that most of the funds will be used by Angola to 
<br>secure Chinese goods and services in support of GRA 
<br>reconstruction priorities, such as the new airport in Luanda, 
<br>new roads, and the rehabilitation of Angola's railroads and 
<br>port facilities. 
<br>
<br>---------------- 
<br>Ex-Im versus CIF 
<br>---------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) When asked to clarify the relationship between the USD 
<br>4.5 billion Ex-Im loan and Angola's relationship with the 
<br>China International Fund (CIF), Zhang was unable or unwilling 
<br>to go too far into specifics, especially concerning the value 
<br>of the relationship, which some independent press sources 
<br>place at near USD 10 billion since 2002. Zhang did say the 
<br>CIF made many promises to Angola, and that while the company 
<br>has a large presence in Angola, its weak management and lack 
<br>of leadership have stalled many of the projects. Zhang said 
<br>that as the CIF is a "private company," the Chinese embassy 
<br>does not actively participate or monitor its relationship 
<br>with Angola. He added that CIF continues to benefit from the 
<br>Hong Kong-based owner's "close relationship" with President 
<br>Dos Santos. Zhang said that while many of the bilateral 
<br>projects were begun by the CIF, currently many of the CIF's 
<br>subcontractors are dealing directly with the various 
<br>ministries of the GRA. 
<br>
<br>---------------- 
<br>The Path Forward 
<br>---------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Zhang said the bilateral discussions during President 
<br>Dos Santos' China visit focused on Angola's plan for 
<br>reconstruction and economic development. Zhang said Angola 
<br>has many plans, but lacks the available capital to place them 
<br>in motion. Zhang mentioned projects such as the new Luanda 
<br>airport (which will cost USD 2 billion and take 3-4 years to 
<br>build), highway construction, railroad construction, the 
<br>refurbishing of the Lobito port and the construction of new 
<br>maritime facilities near Luanda and Soyo. He said those 
<br>projects alone could cost up to USD 8 billion, adding that 
<br>China will not be able to offer sufficient loans to meet 
<br>Angola's needs. He expressed concern that GRA leaders are 
<br>misreading the severity of the current global economic crisis 
<br>and its effect on China's ability to raise private funds for 
<br>projects in Angola. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- -- 
<br>Agriculture and Joint Cooperation with the U.S. 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Zhang said China is promoting a "model farm" program 
<br>in Africa to help developing countries learn agribusiness 
<br>skills so they can become self-sufficient in production and 
<br>add value to the export chain of agricultural products. 
<br>Despite China's broad relationship with the GRA, Angola is 
<br>only on the second tier of proposed country projects. 
<br>Ambassador Mozena raised the possibility of a joint 
<br>U.S.-China assistance project focused on agriculture or 
<br>health - symbolic of our shared goals toward a more peaceful, 
<br>prosperous, secure, and healthy Angola. Zhang was very 
<br>supportive of the initiative and said Chinese companies, 
<br>already under contract with Ex-Im, would be pleased to 
<br>support such a project. Both Ambassadors undertook to 
<br>develop proposals for further consideration. 
<br>

<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) The conversation with Zhang was surprising in its rich 
<br>content and constructive, collaborative tone. While Zhang 
<br>was careful not to go into much detail concerning the 
<br>activities of the CIF, it is clear he wants to distance the 
<br>Embassy and the Government of China from what he appears to 
<br>consider a less than fully transparent and successful 
<br>relationship between the CIF and the GRA. He was positive 
<br>and pragmatic about the forthcoming negotiations toward a new 
<br>commercial line of credit for Angola. We look forward to 
<br>working with Zhang in the near future toward a joint 
<br>bilateral development project. It is important that Angolans 
<br>and other Africa watchers view how our two countries can 
<br>cooperate toward a shared vision of a better Angola. End 
<br>Comment.
