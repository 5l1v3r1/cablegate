<br>SUBJECT: IS NOW THE TIME TO RAISE HIZBALLAH WITH SYRIA?
<br>
<br>Classified By: CDA Charles Hunter, Reasons 1.4 b and d.
<br>
<br>¶1.  (S/NF) Summary: Syria's determined support of Hizballah's
<br>military build-up, particularly the steady supply of
<br>longer-range rockets and the introduction of guided missiles,
<br>could change the military balance and produce a scenario
<br>significantly more destructive than the July-August 2006 war.
<br>If rockets were to rain down on Israeli civilians in Tel
<br>Aviv, Israel would still have powerful incentives, as it did
<br>in 2006, to keep Syria out of the conflict, but it might also
<br>face compelling reasons for targeting Hizballah facilities in
<br>Syria, some of which are in and around populated areas.
<br>Syria's current strategic mindset appears to assume Syria
<br>could avoid involvement in a new conflict, based largely on
<br>its 2006 experience.  Syrian leaders also appear convinced
<br>that arming Hizballah will increase Syria's leverage in
<br>bringing Israel to the negotiating table.  As Washington
<br>weighs how to approach Syrian officials in upcoming
<br>engagement efforts, discussing Hizballah from the perspective
<br>of the regional strategic landscape may help to facilitate a
<br>"big picture" conversation in which we could challenge these
<br>assumptions and focus Damascus on the importance of taking
<br>cooperative steps with the U.S. now.  Though raising this
<br>subject could well distract from a cooperative approach that
<br>shows signs  of progress after months of investment, we
<br>believe sounding a warning, probably in a one-one-on meeting
<br>with President Asad, would be worth considering in pursuit of
<br>a broader, more strategic dialogue. End Summary.
<br>
<br>----------------------------------
<br>Is the Strategic Balance Changing?
<br>----------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2.  (S/NF) Syria's determined efforts to re-arm Hizballah
<br>during and after the July-August 2006 war between Israel and
<br>Hizballah have consistently grabbed Israeli headlines, most
<br>recently with Israeli Chief of Staff Ashkenazi's November 10
<br>revelation that Hizballah possessed 320-kilometer range
<br>rockets.  Jane's Defense Weekly reported October 28 on
<br>Hizballah's deployment of the first guided surface-to-surface
<br>M600 missile on Lebanese soil, with a range of 250 kilometers
<br>and circular error probability of 500 meters.  Public
<br>estimates put Hizballah's stockpile as high as 40,000 rockets
<br>and missiles, reinforcing assessments by some experts that
<br>this build-up may portend a shift in the military balance
<br>between Israel and its northern nemesis.  Hizballah SecGen
<br>Nasrallah's recent claims of possessing a capability to
<br>"destroy" the IDF may overstate the case for domestic and
<br>regional propaganda purposes, but reporting in other channels
<br>confirms Nasrallah's bragging on November 11 that Hizballah
<br>can sustain fire on Tel Aviv and reach "all of Israel."  This
<br>capability, if fully used, would represent a quantum leap
<br>over the damage and psychological terror Hizballah rockets
<br>caused in northern Israel during the 2006 war.
<br>
<br>¶3.  (S/NF)  There is overwhelming evidence that shows Syria
<br>provided not just logistical and other support in moving the
<br>weapons, but was the main source of the weapons.  Syria's
<br>integration of Hizballah into its military doctrine,
<br>moreover, means that Hizballah operatives and facilities
<br>enjoy a growing footprint in Syria.
<br>
<br>¶4.  (S/NF) At least two potential consequences flow from
<br>Hizballah's increased capabilities and Syria's role in
<br>creating them:  (1)  If there is another war between
<br>Hizballah and Israel, it will be far deadlier than the 2006
<br>conflict; (2) as in 2006, there would be compelling reasons
<br>for Israel to want to keep Syria out of any future war if
<br>possible, but there might be a countervailing need to hit
<br>Hizballah and perhaps targets in Syria, some of which are
<br>located in populated areas.
<br>
<br>---------------------------------
<br>Agreeing to Disagree on Hizballah
<br>----------------------------------
<br>
<br>DAMASCUS 00000804  002 OF 003
<br>
<br>¶5.  (S/NF)  U.S.-Syrian discussions on Hizballah have tended
<br>to "agree to disagree" after hitting the wall of conflicting
<br>views on the legitimacy of armed resistance and Israeli
<br>occupation.  Syrian officials, including President Asad,
<br>emphasize their political link to Hizballah and flatly deny
<br>that Syria is arming Hizballah.  They then defend the right
<br>to armed resistance in response to prolonged Israeli
<br>occupation of Syrian and Lebanese territory.  When
<br>convenient, Syrian officials claim they no longer have
<br>responsibility for Hizballah, noting "we are out of Lebanon."
<br>President Asad and FM Muallim have also suggested that the
<br>challenge of disarming Hizballah would be solved after Syria
<br>and Israel signed a peace treaty.  This agreement would lead
<br>naturally to a deal between Lebanon and Israel, thereby
<br>removing the rationale for Hizballah's resistance movement
<br>and setting the stage for the transition of Hizballah to a
<br>purely political party.
<br>
<br>¶6.  (S/NF)  The Syrian government's strategic view of
<br>relations with Hizballah is difficult to assess with high
<br>confidence.  According to various contacts, President Asad
<br>appears to be focused on the possibility of a new conflict
<br>between Israel and Syria, but many suggest he believes that
<br>the red lines of the 2006 war would be preserved.  According
<br>to this model, Syria could avoid direct involvement as long
<br>as Israel refrained from striking targets on Syrian soil.
<br>Syria also seems to be hedging its bets through improved
<br>relations with Turkey, France, and Saudi Arabia, which,
<br>Syrian officials probably hope, would object to Israeli
<br>attacks against Lebanon and/or Syria.
<br>
<br>¶7.  (S/NF) Asad nonetheless appears more convinced than ever
<br>that arming Hizballah is necessary for Syrian security and
<br>perhaps as a stick to bring the current Israeli government
<br>back to negotiations on the return of the Golan.  Syrians
<br>remain resistant to the notion that Syria bears
<br>responsibility for managing a potentially explosive situation
<br>that could draw Damascus into a war neither sought nor
<br>winnable.  They have ably deployed a force field of cognitive
<br>dissonance to resist arguments linking Syria's arming of
<br>Hizballah and the future prospects of Syrian-Israel peace
<br>negotiations.  Israel, they insist, remains the problem, and
<br>only a more active U.S. role can bring and sustain a
<br>resolution.  According to the prevailing Syrian view,
<br>however, U.S.-Syrian relations must normalize before the U.S.
<br>can play the role of a credible honest broker.
<br>
<br>----------------------------------------
<br>The Cooperative Approach Shows Potential
<br>----------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶8.  (S/NF)  As the interagency continues to plot future plans
<br>to engage Syrian officials and thinks about how to recruit
<br>other countries to support our efforts, we face a choice not
<br>only about the level of our engagement, but about the
<br>approach itself.  Up to now, U.S. efforts have largely
<br>focused on developing a cooperative relationship on issues of
<br>mutual interest, such as Iraq and U.S. sanctions.  Our four
<br>month pursuit of military-to-military cooperation on Iraqi
<br>border security represented, in effect, a first step toward
<br>establishing a broader and higher-level dialogue on Iraqi
<br>security issues, including Syrian support of foreign
<br>fighters.  After the August 19 bombings Baghdad rendered
<br>implementation of this initiative impracticable, discussions
<br>in late-September shifted toward a possible CT dialogue.
<br>This new focus provides an alternative mechanism to continue
<br>discussions on Iraqi security issues such as foreign
<br>fighters.  Syrian officials appear willing to go along with
<br>this approach, as long as the emphasis is on building
<br>bilateral relations first.  After months of investment, our
<br>engagement efforts are close to enabling both sides to
<br>exchange positive gestures.  This cooperation should help to
<br>the stage for more focused discussions on a broad range of
<br>issues and strategic choices about the future direction of
<br>
<br>DAMASCUS 00000804  003 OF 003
<br>
<br>the relationship.
<br>
<br>¶9.  (S/NF)  During this process, U.S. officials have
<br>carefully placed markers on key issues, including human
<br>rights, IAEA compliance, Bank Aman, Lebanon (e.g., border
<br>demarcation), and Palestinians (pushing Hamas to accept the
<br>Quartet principles), and the new embassy compound.  We have
<br>addressed these issues mainly in discussions with Vice
<br>Foreign Minister Miqdad and the Syrian Embassy in Washington
<br>(with less dialogue between Embassy Damascus and the Syrian
<br>MFA).  Our view is that the cooperative approach will have
<br>more chance of success if we continue to use these channels
<br>to deal with such issues, until the relationship can sustain
<br>discussion at higher levels that will yield a higher
<br>probability of favorable progress.
<br>
<br>¶10.  (S/NF)  Against this backdrop, sending U.S. officials to
<br>focus on Syrian relations with Hizballah could distract
<br>significantly from our efforts to build a cooperative
<br>foothold.  There is unlikely to be common ground or any
<br>breakthroughs, and a new focus on Hizballah-related issues
<br>could further set back our efforts to re-energize the
<br>engagement process, not least by spurring the Syrians to
<br>demand a reciprocal change in U.S. behavior, e.g., lifting
<br>sanctions.  Focusing our higher political-level discussions
<br>on the issue of foreign fighters provides a more familiar
<br>subject with a higher chance for initial progress.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- --
<br>But Hizballah's Arsenal Poses Urgent Challenges
<br>--------------------------------------------- --
<br>
<br>¶11.  (S/NF)  While the near-term chances for a successful
<br>dialogue on Syria's strategic relationship with Hizballah are
<br>much lower, the stakes -- the possibility of a regional
<br>conflict and significant obstacles to achieving comprehensive
<br>peace -- are just as, if not more, urgent.  Sharing our
<br>concerns about the dangers of Syria's arming of Hizballah,
<br>probably best done privately in a one-on-one session with
<br>President Asad, could serve to establish the basis of a more
<br>frank exchange about Syria's role, and enable us to challenge
<br>potentially dangerous Syrian assumptions as part of a wider
<br>strategic dialogue.  Recent revelations about Syria's role in
<br>weapons shipments create some urgency in turning Syrian
<br>attention toward ending these supplies and restraining
<br>Hizballah from making good on its provocative rhetoric.
<br>
<br>¶12.  (S/NF) We don't expect these points immediately to
<br>change Syrian behavior or its relations with Hizballah, but
<br>we believe sounding this warning would put President Asad and
<br>others (such as Turkey and France) on notice that Syria's
<br>actions have created a situation in which miscalculation or
<br>provocative behavior by Hizballah could prove disastrous for
<br>Syria and the broader region.  This message could likewise
<br>underscore our belief that Syria needs to demonstrate a more
<br>active role in achieving peace with Israel and better
<br>relations with the United States.  Even if a war between
<br>Israel and Hizballah does not materialize in the immediate
<br>future, we should try find a way to use our ongoing
<br>cooperative engagement with Syrian officials to help them
<br>recognize their overriding interest and responsibility in
<br>preventing this unappealing scenario altogether.
