<br>SUBJECT: ENGAGEMENT WITH MUSLIM COMMUNITIES - FRANCE 
<br>
<br>REF: 06 STATE 185834 
<br>
<br>Sensitive but unclassified - entire text. Please protect 
<br>accordingly. 
<br>
<br>¶1. Summary: The Ambassador and all of Mission France support a 
<br>sustained and focused effort to engage France's Muslim minorities, 
<br>recognizing that organizing and executing such an effort will 
<br>continue to require considerable discretion, sensitivity and tact on 
<br>our part. Although there is some evidence that France's Muslim 
<br>minorities are better integrated than their counterparts elsewhere 
<br>in Europe, the French have a well-known problem with discrimination 
<br>against minorities. French media has fallen short in their 
<br>reporting on these issues and French government and private 
<br>institutions also found it difficult to face up squarely to the 
<br>challenges involved. We can engage the French both privately and 
<br>via the media on the issue of minority inclusion, but superior 
<br>French language skills are crucial to make effective use of the 
<br>French broadcast media. 
<br>
<br>¶2. Our specific goals for this strategy: a) demonstration of our 
<br>commitment to these issues, b) sharing of our American experiences 
<br>in managing diversity, and c) encouraging social reforms within 
<br>France to improve the lot of its minorities. 
<br>
<br>¶3. Post will continue to grow its established minority outreach 
<br>effort, identifying Arab-Muslim outreach projects as such in 
<br>expanded program reporting. Effectiveness will be measured in terms 
<br>of audience and participant totals, improved French media treatment 
<br>of minority issues, a measurably improved perception of the U.S. 
<br>among target audiences, and the initiation of new policies and 
<br>programs by both the French government and French non-governmental 
<br>organizations to improve the lot of French Arabs and Muslims. 
<br>
<br>¶4. Contact information for post's designated minority engagement 
<br>officers - PDOff Colombia Barrosse and PolOff William Stephen Wells 
<br>- is in the last paragraph. End summary. 
<br>
<br>------------- 
<br>The Challenge 
<br>------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. Reftel tasked post to produce a '07 - '08 public outreach 
<br>strategy for engaging France's Muslim minorities, to counter 
<br>terrorist recruiting among them, and to foster their greater 
<br>integration into mainstream French society. We regret the late 
<br>response to this tasking. 
<br>
<br>¶6. Embassy Paris and its seven field posts began to reach out 
<br>systematically to France's Arab and Muslim populations several years 
<br>ago, in 2003, targeting neighborhoods and institutions known to have 
<br>large immigrant populations (first, second and third generation.) 
<br>Since that time post established a broad base of political reporting 
<br>on French Muslim issues, and the post's Public Affairs Section 
<br>increasingly focused its program assets (speakers, DVCs, exhibits, 
<br>exchanges and grants) on minority communities, under the more 
<br>acceptable rubric of "civil society" outreach. 
<br>
<br>¶7. Organizing and executing this outreach required sensitivity and 
<br>discretion due to France's particular philosophical outlook and 
<br>history. It has the largest Muslim minority population in Western 
<br>Europe, both as an absolute number and as a percentage of the 
<br>national population. France's five million plus Muslims are largely 
<br>North African (Algerian, Moroccan and Tunisian) in origin, although 
<br>they remain diverse and resistant to blanket categorization. The 
<br>French Government's approach to religion and minorities 
<br>traditionally has been to promote assimilation under the banner of 
<br>equality, however imperfectly that goal has been achieved, with a 
<br>strong emphasis on "laicite" (secularism) in public spaces. This 
<br>policy demands official blindness to all racial and ethnic 
<br>differences. French law formally prohibits the collection of 
<br>statistics on the basis of race, religion, or ethnic background; and 
<br>only approximate figures are available to us regarding France's 
<br>minorities, including Muslims. 
<br>
<br>¶8. Concepts such as "affirmative action," "diversity," 
<br>"multiculturalism," or compound descriptions of identity (e.g. 
<br>Arab-American) are relatively new and somewhat controversial in 
<br>France, where the approach has been more to target specific 
<br>geographic enclaves, e.g. educational programs for neighborhoods 
<br>with a high percentage of socio-economically disadvantaged (often 
<br>Arab and Muslim) youth. 
<br>
<br>¶9. Young French citizens across the religious spectrum tend not to 
<br>be practicing/devout, but disadvantaged minority youth remain an 
<br>obvious target for extremist recruiting. As a result of recent 
<br>events (including the November 2005 unrest in the suburbs), 
<br>diversity and integration are discussed more openly - at 
<br>conferences, as well as on talk shows and campuses. Nevertheless, it 
<br>remains generally indelicate in France to ask a person's religious 
<br>affiliation. Challenging the government's approach to assimilation 
<br>can amount to challenging the basis of French identity within the 
<br>Republic. 
<br>
<br>¶10. The organization and execution of any official USG Muslim 
<br>outreach strategy in such an environment - whatever the strong 
<br>justification in our eyes - will continue to require considerable 
<br>and continuing discretion, sensitivity and tact. 
<br>
<br>----------------- 
<br>Media Environment 
<br>----------------- 
<br>
<br>¶11. As in other European countries, French media reporting of U.S. 
<br>policies and intentions is often skeptical. Reporting by the 
<br>mainstream media on Arab Muslims and their issues, however, is 
<br>typically not so much negative as negligent, falling short both in 
<br>its coverage of discrimination towards them and of juvenile 
<br>delinquency among them. 
<br>
<br>¶12. Official Americans and pro-USG surrogates have ready access to 
<br>most French media to convey official policy messages, but using that 
<br>access effectively presents a special challenge. Superior French 
<br>language and presentation skills are especially important for making 
<br>effective use of French broadcast media. Communicating to the 
<br>French about the treatment of their minorities, a topic they 
<br>themselves are often reticent to explore in depth, is more difficult 
<br>for us than, say, describing our own, American experience. Any 
<br>ill-prepared efforts to reach out to France's Muslim audiences could 
<br>easily become counter-productive. We therefore must continue to 
<br>proceed with care. 
<br>
<br>¶13. Our primary media focus needs to be on TV and radio, but print - 
<br>and the new media - should not be ignored. 
<br>
<br>¶14. Fewer or less than one French adult in four reads a national 
<br>newspaper regularly. Regional papers are still important, however, 
<br>with Ouest France (Rennes) being the largest daily. The French are 
<br>more avid magazine readers, buying over three billion copies a year. 
<br>
<br>¶15. French broadcasting is partly state-owned and partly in the 
<br>hands of private enterprise. Most French TV viewers still, 
<br>reportedly, prefer the six major broadcast channels, but the number 
<br>of channels offered by various cable and satellite operators 
<br>continues to grow, with the newest being France 24, a CNN-like 
<br>24-hour news-station. Average French TV viewership is over five and 
<br>one-half hours per day. 
<br>¶16. Radio, especially FM, remains an important medium in France: 
<br>over 99 per cent of French households own at least one radio and 
<br>almost 5 in 6 over the age of 13 year listen to the radio daily. As 
<br>with TV, French radio is part state-owned and part private. 
<br>¶17. Top French journalists are often products of the same elite 
<br>schools as many French government leaders. These journalists do not 
<br>necessarily regard their primary role as to check the power of 
<br>government. Rather, many see themselves more as intellectuals, 
<br>preferring to analyze events and influence readers more than to 
<br>report events. 
<br>¶18. The private sector media in France - print and broadcast - 
<br>continues to be dominated by a small number of conglomerates, and 
<br>all French media are more regulated and subjected to political and 
<br>commercial pressures than are their American counterparts. The 
<br>Higher Audio-Visual Council, created in 1989, appoints the CEOs of 
<br>all French public broadcasting channels and monitors their political 
<br>content. 
<br>¶19. Internet access is growing steadily in France, especially among 
<br>the younger generation, rapidly replacing traditional media. All 
<br>important television and radio channels in France have their own 
<br>websites, as do the major print media. Blogs are an increasingly 
<br>popular method of communication for minorities and NGOs, who use 
<br>them to express opinions they do not feel are reflected in the 
<br>traditional media. 
<br>¶20. France's first generation Arab immigrants typically continue to 
<br>read publications from their countries of origin, and the major 
<br>Algerian, Moroccan and Tunisian papers are widely available in 
<br>larger French cities. These individuals also watch satellite and 
<br>cable TV stations in Arabic, including Al-Jazeerah TV. Second and 
<br>third generation French Arabs, however, are typically not literate 
<br>in Arab, and their print media habits are similar to those of other 
<br>French readers. 
<br>-------------- 
<br>Specific Goals 
<br>-------------- 
<br>
<br>¶21. DEMONSTRATE OUR COMMITMENT. We need to say and show, repeatedly, 
<br>to Muslim and non-Muslim audiences alike, the USG is engaged for 
<br>good in the Arab-Muslim world, we respect Islam, and the USG takes 
<br>seriously the potentially global threat of disenfranchised and 
<br>disadvantaged minorities in France. For those reasons, and because 
<br>we believe in participatory democracy, we promote the advancement 
<br>and full integration of France's minorities into mainstream 
<br>society. 
<br>
<br>¶22. SHARE OUR EXPERIENCES. We also must continue to communicate, 
<br>well and often, to both Muslim and non-Muslim audiences in France, 
<br>the American experience with ethnic and social conflict - both our 
<br>successes and our failures - in order to establish our legitimacy 
<br>for engagement on this issue. We can strengthen the sense of shared 
<br>values and common cause between Americans and French working for 
<br>inter-communal cooperation, peace, stability, opportunity and 
<br>respect. In addition, we need to remain present, listening and 
<br>showing respect for French (immigrant and non-immigrant) 
<br>experiences. 
<br>
<br>¶23. Most French minorities, including Arabs, are somewhat aware of 
<br>the U.S. experience and positively inclined towards us, seeing us as 
<br>having tried to address our shortcomings. What many French lack is 
<br>specific information about or any in-depth understanding of our 
<br>experience that might help them to conceive of and implement a 
<br>workable French model for addressing ethnic conflict. The French 
<br>establishment, for the most part, has been reticent to face up to 
<br>these problems or their root causes, reluctant to accept the U.S. as 
<br>a model - or as a partner. The Ministry of Education, however, has 
<br>shown its willingness to engage with us in this area. 
<br>
<br>¶24. ENCOURAGE REFORM. We must continue to encourage and help to 
<br>empower moderate social reformers in France to preempt and thwart 
<br>those who would aggravate social discontent for the purposes of 
<br>extremist recruiting. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- -- 
<br>Humanitarian/Development Issues to be addressed 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -- 
<br>
<br>¶25. Although France has a highly developed, modern economy with 
<br>significant resources at its disposal, much of the discontent 
<br>reported by French minority communities relates to economic and 
<br>social exclusion. While direct development assistance from the USG 
<br>is not likely to be available for France, some USG financial and 
<br>program resources were and will continue to be deployed to address 
<br>the consequences of discrimination and minority exclusion in France. 
<br>Some French NGOs working to assist minority youth, for example, 
<br>received financial and other support - such as invitations to 
<br>participate in exchange programs - through the Embassy to pursue 
<br>specific programs. 
<br>
<br>------------------------ 
<br>Target Audiences by Goal 
<br>------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶26. DEMONSTRATE COMMITMENT. We need to show the USG takes seriously 
<br>the threat of disenfranchised and disadvantaged minorities around 
<br>the world, including in France, and we are committed to empowering 
<br>minorities as part of our fundamental belief in participatory 
<br>democracy. 
<br>
<br>¶27. Our target audiences for this goal include both Muslims and 
<br>non-Muslims: at-risk youth, professionals who serve them, NGO 
<br>leaders, and the media, both national and regional. We will 
<br>continue to engage resident Muslim country diplomats to improve 
<br>their understanding of the U.S. We also must continue to educate 
<br>ourselves systematically on Islam through such efforts as our 
<br>in-house speaker program, which recently invited a prominent French 
<br>scholar on Islam to address a lunchtime roundtable for Embassy 
<br>staffers. 
<br>
<br>¶28. While much of the existing effort already ties into our current 
<br>Embassy public diplomacy strategy, increased funding for exchanges, 
<br>speakers and grants would be most welcome. So would more help from 
<br>Washington with recruiting minority speakers (Francophones) and 
<br>further access to short-term exchanges, such as ECA's summer 
<br>institutes, to target minority educators. 
<br>
<br>¶29. SHARE EXPERIENCES. We must continue communication in a broad 
<br>and frequent manner to audiences in France about our own American 
<br>experience with ethnic and social conflict. We need to demonstrate 
<br>our legitimate standing on this issue in order to strengthen the 
<br>sense of shared values and common cause between Americans and the 
<br>French. 
<br>
<br>¶30. Our target audience for this goal, again, is Muslim and 
<br>non-Muslim, but especially the media, NGOs, educators, and French 
<br>youth (students and professionals.) All need to engage - themselves 
<br>and each other - to resolve the minority problems facing France. 
<br>
<br>¶31. As with the earlier goal, a considerable effort is already 
<br>underway, tied to our existing public diplomacy strategy, but 
<br>increased funding for exchanges, speakers and grants would enable us 
<br>to reinforce our current efforts. 
<br>
<br>¶32. ENCOURAGE REFORM. We need to encourage moderate social 
<br>reformers in France and thwart those who would aggravate social 
<br>discontent for the purposes of extremist recruiting. 
<br>
<br>¶33. Our target audience for this goal should be both social reform 
<br>elements and the individual young Muslims most likely to be targeted 
<br>by extremist recruiters. The reformers need to be encouraged and 
<br>resourced. The minority youth need to believe that they have a 
<br>bright future in their adopted country and that they have nothing to 
<br>gain and much to lose by association with extremist violence. 
<br>Specific programs we could deploy to address these audiences include 
<br>our existing media and Information Resource Center outreach efforts, 
<br>increased targeting of our exchange programs to those engaged on 
<br>minority issues, and expanded personal outreach by the entire 
<br>Mission staff via our in-house public speaker program. A concerted 
<br>effort will also be made to increase invitations to Muslims and 
<br>other minorities for Mission representational events, not only in 
<br>Paris but also in our field posts across France. 
<br>Again, increased funding for exchanges, speakers and grants would 
<br>enable us to reinforce our current efforts. 
<br>
<br>----------------------- 
<br>Measuring Effectiveness 
<br>----------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶34. We will now identify our minority outreach efforts more clearly 
<br>as such in our routine program reporting, tying into the new PD 
<br>evaluation project led by ECA's PD Evaluation Office. We will 
<br>measure our effectiveness in terms of audience and participant 
<br>totals, improved French media treatment of minority issues, improved 
<br>perceptions of the U.S. among minority audiences, and the initiation 
<br>of new policies and programs by the French government and/or French 
<br>non-governmental organizations to improve the lot of French Arabs 
<br>and Muslims. 
<br>
<br>---------------- 
<br>Embassy Contacts 
<br>---------------- 
<br>
<br>¶35. Minority engagement officers for Embassy Paris are PDOff 
<br>Colombia Barrosse (BarrosseCX@state.gov, x 4541), who coordinates 
<br>our programmatic outreach and PolOff William S. (Steve) Wells 
<br>(WellsWS@state.gov, x 4284), who tracks minority issues for 
<br>reporting.
