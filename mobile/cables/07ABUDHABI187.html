<br>GENERAL MOSELEY 
<br> 
<br>REF: A. ABU DHABI 97 
<br>     ¶B. ABU DHABI 145 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Michele Sison, reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (S) Summary.  Abu Dhabi Crown Prince and Deputy Supreme 
<br>Commander of the UAE Armed Forces Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed 
<br>(MbZ) Al Nahyan hosted Chief of Staff USAF General T. Michael 
<br>Moseley on February 1, 2007.  MbZ warned Moseley of the 
<br>growing threat from Iran, stating that they (Iran) "can't be 
<br>allowed to have a nuclear program."  MbZ further emphasized 
<br>that Iran's nuclear program must be stopped "by all means 
<br>available."  As expected, MbZ inquired about Predator B. 
<br>Moseley informed MbZ that the question of Predator B would 
<br>require further discussion within the interagency and with 
<br>our MTCR partners, while Ambassador noted that the USG looked 
<br>forward to discussion of UAE defense requirements and our 
<br>shared security objectives in the context of the Gulf 
<br>Security Dialogue.  MbZ expressed a desire to have a missile 
<br>defense system in place by Summer 2009, and was looking to 
<br>add ship-based launch platforms as a part of that system.  He 
<br>also noted that the UAE had identified a location on the 
<br>northern border at an elevation of 6,000 feet that may be 
<br>suitable for installation of an early warning radar system. 
<br>End Summary. 
<br> 
<br>Iran 
<br>---- 
<br>¶2. (S) Stating that "we are living in a dangerous 
<br>neighborhood," MbZ stressed the importance of curtailing 
<br>Iran's nuclear program to the overall stability of the Gulf, 
<br>the Middle East as a region, and to the world's energy 
<br>markets.  Pointing out that a nuclear weapon with even a 
<br>short-range delivery system puts all the critical 
<br>infrastructure in the Gulf at risk -- as well as the oil 
<br>shipping lanes -- MbZ asserted: "If Iran can increase oil 
<br>production to more than 15 million barrels of oil per day, 
<br>let them have nuclear power, but until they can replace (the 
<br>Gulf's) oil production they can't be allowed to have a 
<br>nuclear program." 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S) MbZ told Moseley that the US should not focus too much 
<br>on Ahmadinejad as the problem, but should focus instead on 
<br>"the greater Iranian threat."  Calling Ahmadinejad  "merely 
<br>the driver" of a bus (nuclear program) that has been running 
<br>for a long time in Iran, MbZ described Iran's nuclear program 
<br>as one that is no longer driven by personalities -- but which 
<br>has become part of the Iranian identity.  Noting that even if 
<br>Ahmadinejad or other leaders were to change, the nuclear 
<br>program would still continue, MbZ stated: "Even a siege at 
<br>this point will not change anything."   In answer to 
<br>Moseley's question what should be done, MbZ responded: "Delay 
<br>their program -- by all means available."  He added: "I am 
<br>saying this knowing that I am putting my country at risk and 
<br>placing myself in a dangerous spot." 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (S) Speaking about his fears of Iran's growing hegemonic 
<br>aspirations, MbZ warned the US not to underestimate the 
<br>Iranians characterizing them as "extremely smart."  "It 
<br>amazes me," MbZ continued, "that the Muslim Brotherhood, 
<br>which controls Hamas, has at its core an opposition to all 
<br>things Shi'a, and yet they (Hamas) cooperate with Iran.  That 
<br>shows you how smart they are."  MbZ then pointed to what he 
<br>called successful Iranian actions in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, 
<br>and Palestine to illustrate how Iran has managed to 
<br>manipulate Muslim extremism in order to advance Shi'a and 
<br>Iranian goals. 
<br> 
<br>UAV/Predator B 
<br>-------------- 
<br>¶5. (S) MbZ again asked about the status of the UAE request to 
<br>acquire Predator B.  GeneralMoseley informed MbZ that the 
<br>question of Predatr B acquisition would require further 
<br>discussionwithin the interagency and with our MTCR partners. 
<br> MbZ nodded in understanding: "We are patient." He then 
<br>added: "I hope the Iranians give us time; they are aggressive 
<br>and are moving fast."  MbZ also mentioned that there were 
<br>several other countries offering UAVs to the UAE.  Ambassador 
<br>added that the U.S. and the other 33 MTCR members would be 
<br>meeting in March to review the MTCR control list.  Growing 
<br>demand worldwide for unmanned aerial vehicles had led to the 
<br>need for a general discussion of how the MTCR controls UAVs 
<br>and cruise missiles, and the USG looked forward to further 
<br>discussion of UAE defense requirements and our shared 
<br>security objectives in the context of the ongoing Gulf 
<br>Security Dialogue (GSD). 
<br> 
<br>Strategic Interests 
<br>------------------- 
<br> 
<br>ABU DHABI 00000187  002 OF 002 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (S) Moseley's meeting with MbZ immediately followed a 
<br>Raytheon/Lockheed Martin briefing of MbZ on the ongoing 
<br>development of THAAD/PAC-3 and shared early warning systems. 
<br>Speaking of a time frame for the first time, MbZ said he 
<br>wants a complete missile defense system by summer 2009.  MbZ 
<br>expressed particular interest in the possibility of mounting 
<br>PAC-3 on Littoral Combat Ships (LCS).  Learning that PAC-3 
<br>cannot yet be mounted on a seagoing platform, MbZ was pleased 
<br>to note that SLAMRAAM has already tested successfully on a 
<br>wide variety of platforms and could be ship-based. Sheikh 
<br>(Major) Ahmed bin Tahnoon A-Nahyan, advisor to MbZ on 
<br>critical infrastructure protection, took particular note of 
<br>this fact and asked about upgrading/extending their existing 
<br>Hawk/AMRAAM assets.  When briefers noted the 32km limit of 
<br>unelevated radar, MbZ stated that he has a location 
<br>identified on the UAE's northern border at an elevation of 
<br>6000 feet that he would like contractors to come back and 
<br>look at as a possible location for an early warning radar 
<br>system.  Also present was International Affairs Advisor to 
<br>the Crown Prince's Court Yousef Al-Otaiba, who is a UAE 
<br>representative to the GSD. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (S) Comment: Although MbZ is increasingly talking tough on 
<br>Iran, i.e., stop Iran "by all means possible" and "deal with 
<br>Iran sooner rather than later" (ref A), his comments should 
<br>also be taken in the context of strong UAE interest in 
<br>acquiring advanced military technology and, specifically, 
<br>MbZ's repeated requests for Predator B (ref B).  The UAEG is 
<br>clearly nervous about any US actions that could upset their 
<br>much larger and militarily superior neighbor. The UAE's 
<br>significant trade relationship with Iran--approximately $4 
<br>billion--is another complicating factor in the relationship. 
<br>On more than one occasion, the UAE leadership has expressed 
<br>trepidation over the prospect of being caught in the middle 
<br>between the US and Iran.  End Comment. 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (U) POLAD, Chief of Staff USAF, Ambassador Marcelle M. 
<br>Wahba has approved this message.
