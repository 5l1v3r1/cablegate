<br>CLASSIFIED BY: Ronald P. Spogli, Ambassador, for reasons 1.4 (b), (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (U) This is a joint Political and Economic Section cable.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C/NF) Summary. Italy's relationship with Russia is
<br>complex, encompassing historical ideological sympathies,
<br>geostrategic calculations, commercial pressure, energy
<br>dependence, and personal relationships between top leaders.
<br>The combination of these factors creates a strong tendency
<br>for Italy's foreign policy to be highly receptive to Russian
<br>efforts to gain greater political influence in the EU and
<br>to support Russia's efforts to dilute American security
<br>interests in Europe. In its relationship with Russia, energy
<br>is the most important bilateral issue and the quest for
<br>stable energy supplies from Russia frequently forces
<br>Italy to compromise on security and political issues.
<br>A not insignificant concomitant factor is PM
<br>Berlusconi's desire to be seen as an important
<br>European player on foreign policy, leading him to
<br>go where others dare not. End summary.
<br>
<br>Roots of Italian Russophilia: Ideology on the Left, a
<br>Long-Standing Market Opportunity on the Right
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br>
<br>¶3. (C/NF) Until the 2008 parliamentary elections, the Italian
<br>Communist party and various leftist splinter groups were a
<br>permanent fixture of the Italian political scene. Throughout the Cold
<br>War members of the Italian communist movement maintained close
<br>ties with the Soviet Union, other communist countries, and many
<br>communist revolutionary movements. Unlike many other communist parties
<br>around the world, the Italian communist movement remained
<br>unapologetic in its continued belief in Marxism-Leninism as a viable
<br>economic alternative to capitalism. While many European leftist
<br>intellectuals recognize that -- aside from an authoritarian approach to
<br>governing - - Putin's Russia bears little resemblance to Communist
<br>ideals, this fact has not deterred Italian communists and other radical
<br>left politicians from being openly pro-Russia on the basis of
<br>ideological solidarity. This, combined with the advanced average age o
<br>most high-level Italian politicians (65-70), prevents many in the
<br>far left of Italy's political spectrum from moving beyond a worldview
<br>developed (and apparently frozen) during the Cold War.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C/NF) Throughout the Cold War, Italian business interests
<br>frequently skirted the line of what was appropriate in their
<br>pursuit of the Soviet market. After the collapse of the Soviet
<br>Union, the explosion of consumer wealth in Russia created massive deman
<br>for high-end and luxury Italian exports. From 1998 to 2007
<br>Italian exports to Russia grew by 230 percent, from 2.7 billion Euros
<br>to 9.5 Billion. Many of Italy's leading businessmen began to see
<br>Russia as a limitless market that could substitute for loss of export
<br>revenue from other parts of the world. These businessmen maintain
<br>strong ties to the pro-business, free-market-oriented politicians on
<br>the right, including the most visible patron of Italy's business
<br>elite: PM Silvio Berlusconi.
<br>
<br>Putin Most Influential Figure in Italy's Russia Policy
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - -
<br>
<br>¶5. (C/NF) While Italy's political parties, the MFA and ENI
<br>exert some influence on Italy's Russia policy, by far the most importan
<br>factor is the personal attention Putin devotes to the relationship.
<br>By our reckoning, Putin has held more bilateral meetings with
<br>sitting Italian PMs in the recent past than any other world leader.
<br>He was the first world leader to meet with Berlusconi after the 2008
<br>elections, arriving in Sardegna to visit the PM designate
<br>before the latter had even been sworn in. Berlusconi believes that
<br>Putin is his close and personal friend and continues to have more
<br>contact with Putin than with any other world leader. During the Georgi
<br>crisis, Berlusconi spoke to Putin on a daily basis for a period of
<br>almost a week. The basis of the friendship is hard to determine, but
<br>many interlocutors have told us that Berlusconi believes that
<br>Putin, a fellow 'tycoon', trusts Berlusconi more than other European
<br>leader. (A contact in the PM's office told us that their frequent
<br>meetings are accompanied by exchanges of lavish gifts). Berlusconi
<br>admires Putin's macho, decisive, and authoritarian governing style,
<br>which the Italian PM believes matches his own. From the Russian side,
<br>it appears that Putin has devoted much energy to developing
<br>Berlusconi's trust.
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) Contacts in both the opposition center-left PD
<br>
<br>Rome 00000097 002 of 005
<br>
<br>
<br>party and Berlusconi's own PdL party, however, have hinted at a more
<br>nefarious connection. They believe that Berlusconi and his cronies are
<br>profiting personally and handsomely from many of the energy
<br>deals between Italy and Russia. The Georgian ambassador in Rome
<br>has told us that the GOG believes Putin has promised Berlusconi a
<br>percentage of profits from any pipelines developed by Gazprom in
<br>coordination with ENI. Whenever we raise the issue of Russia and the P
<br>with our contacts in PdL, Berlusconi's own party, they have usually
<br>pointed us to Valentino Valentini, a member of parliament and somewhat
<br>shadowy figure who operates as Berluscon's key man on Russia, albeit
<br>with no staff or even a secretary. Valentini, a Russian-speaker who
<br>travels to Russia several times per month, frequently appears at
<br>Berlusconi's side when he meets other world leaders. What he does in
<br>Moscow during his frequent visits is unclear but he is widely
<br>rumored to be looking after Berlusconi's business interests in Russia.
<br>Our contacts uniformly deem Valentini, a multilingual former
<br>interpreter, close to Berlusconi with regard to Russia, but not a polic
<br>person.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C/NF) All of our interlocutors - xxxxxxxxxxxx - report that Berlusconi determines
<br>Italy's policy on Russia single-handedly, neither seeking nor
<br>accepting counsel. Virtually all are reluctant to confront the PM even
<br>when he is at his worst on Russia. In November 2008, after a
<br>disastrous press conference in which, inter alia, the PM described NATO
<br>expansion, recognition of Kosovo's independence, and missile
<br>defense as "U.S. provocations" of Russia, GOI officials did a classic
<br>duck- and-cover. In response to our objections, MFA and PM staff
<br>sheepishly directed us to the PM himself, rather than deliver
<br>the unpleasant news to him that he had angered not only the
<br>Americans but other members of the Contact Group for the Balkans, not t
<br>mention the Czechs and Poles. Even FM Frattini admits to wielding no
<br>influence on Berlusconi on Russia. During an early September
<br>visit to Italy, former VP Cheney confronted Frattini on Italy's
<br>very public and unhelpful stance on the Georgia conflict. A subdued
<br>Frattini noted that, while he had strong opinions on the issue, he
<br>nevertheless received his marching orders from the PM.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C/NF) Distressingly, Berlusconi treats Russia policy as
<br>he does his domestic political affairs - tactically and day-to-day.
<br>His overwhelming desire is to remain in Putin's good graces, and
<br>he has frequently voiced opinions and declarations that have been
<br>passed to him directly by Putin. One such example: in the aftermath of
<br>the Georgia crisis, Berlusconi began (and continues) to insist
<br>that Georgia was the aggressor and that the GOG was responsible
<br>for several hundred civilian deaths in South Ossetia.
<br>
<br>No Institutional Leadership on Russia
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br>
<br>¶9. (C/NF) Trying to determine who might have some influence
<br>on Berlusconi's Russia policy is not an easy task. One thing is
<br>certain, however - it is not the foreign policy institutions
<br>of the GOI. FM Frattini is widely seen as only the messenger for PM
<br>Berlusconi's Russia policy - indeed he termed himself as much
<br>to VP Cheney during the latter's September 2008 visit to Rome.
<br>Within the professional ranks, resources and expertise are scant.
<br>Italy's MFA contains only one full-time diplomat assigned to cover
<br>Russia and the countries of the former Soviet Union: the Office
<br>Director. The Deputy Office Director position and single Desk Officer
<br>position assigned to cover all the countries of the FSU are vacant.
<br>Italy's dire budget situation is likely to prevent the hiring of
<br>additional staff at the MFA for at least two years, according to one MF
<br>source. The Office Director's direct supervisor - the A/S equivalent
<br>- is also responsible for the Balkans and the rest of Europe, but
<br>she, like Frattini, appears to have little or no input to GOI
<br>Russia policy. The PM's staff does not fare much better. The
<br>Office of the Diplomatic Advisor is thinly staffed - with only one
<br>officer assigned to each geographic region. The position covering
<br>Russia is staffed by a midlevel diplomat who is in the process of being
<br>transferred. No replacement is likely to be named. As a result, the
<br>officer covering the Middle East (also the deputy for the office)
<br>will be forced to take on those duties in addition to his already
<br>overwhelming portfolio and management duties.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C/NF) In 2008 the MFA undertook an effort to produce a
<br>long-term foreign policy strategy for the GOI. In a paper entitled
<br>"Rapporto 2020" the MFA outlined its strategic vision for the next
<br>decade and a half. The document notes that geostrategic realities have
<br>created the need for Italy to adapt its foreign policy with regard to
<br>Russia and calls for Italy to seek 'a privileged relationship' with
<br>Moscow in order to press its overwhelmingly preeminent bilateral
<br>concern: energy.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Energy Becomes Key Bilateral Issue
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br>
<br>¶11. (C/NF) With virtually no domestic energy reserves, no
<br>domestic nuclear power, and an ambitious parastatal energy company,
<br>Italy's key bilateral concern with Russia has become the quest for
<br>long-term guarantees of energy supplies. The GOI has supported ENI and
<br>other energy giants' efforts to create a unique partnership with
<br>Russia and Gazprom for long-term cooperation. ENI, Italy's most
<br>prominent energy parastatal, wields immense political power; its
<br>business strategy has focused on complicated geopolitical environments
<br>generally perceived as overly risky by many of its international
<br>competitors. ENI's lobbying efforts vis-(-vis the GOI are better
<br>funded than most government offices. It hosts one diplomatic
<br>advisor assigned from the MFA. Going by press reports alone, we
<br>would judge that PM Berlusconi grants its director, Paolo Scaroni, as
<br>much access as he does his own FM.xxxxxxxxxxxx. Members of political
<br>parties on both sides of the aisle have told us that ENI is
<br>one of the leading financial contributors to Italy's many
<br>think-tanks - many of which produce public diplomacy discussions and
<br>events on the importance of Italy-Russia relations. At one such event
<br>in 2007, a conference on Central Asia, representatives from ENI and
<br>Edison were given 30 minutes each to speak, while the four Foreign
<br>Ministers and Deputy Foreign Minister of five Central Asian former
<br>Soviet states were all crammed into a single hour. There is even
<br>suspicion that ENI maintains journalists on its payroll.
<br>
<br>¶12. (C/NF) Members of political parties from both sides of
<br>the aisle have told us that ENI does not limit its dialogue with the
<br>government to energy issues. One member of the opposition center-left
<br>PD party told poloffs that ENI's presence in Russia exceeds that of
<br>Italy's understaffed embassy. While it is unclear how much policy
<br>coordination occurs between ENI and the Russian political
<br>structure, the same PD party members noted that ENI had as much contact
<br>with Russian political and economic leaders as the embassy, if not
<br>more, and political messages were frequently passed through such
<br>commercial/economic channels. Back in Rome, ENI maintains
<br>strong contacts with members of the Italian parliament - something
<br>the MFA does not do (apart from requested briefings to members of the
<br>foreign affairs committees).
<br>
<br>An Energy Policy without the Policy
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br>
<br>¶13. (C/NF) ENI and other energy giants have managed to press
<br>their case quite effectively within the highest ranks of the GOI.
<br>Italian leaders on both sides of the aisle seem strangely unconcerned
<br>about dependence on Russian energy. They point out that Italy
<br>depended on Russian coal during the darkest days of the Cold War with n
<br>dire consequence. Italians are also lulled into complacency by
<br>the fact that geographic proximity to North African resources means
<br>that they are far less dependent on Russia than are the Germans or the
<br>former Eastern bloc countries.
<br>
<br>¶14. (C/NF) During a March 2008 visit to ENI Headquarters
<br>embassy staff were given a briefing on ENI's Russian energy
<br>operations (available on Embassy Rome's Classified web site). ENI's
<br>view of the European energy situation was disturbingly similar to that
<br>of GAZPROM and the Kremlin, and at times laced with rhetorical
<br>flourishes reminiscent of Soviet-era double-speak: according to ENI,
<br>the real threat to Western Europe's energy security is not Russia --
<br>it is Ukraine. The real solution to Europe's energy insecurity,
<br>according to ENI, lies in more direct pipeline connections to Russian
<br>gas fields and a need for pipelines that do not go through
<br>Ukraine - the rationale for the South Stream and Nord Stream pipelines
<br>(ref b).
<br>ENI's engineering arm hopes to construct both pipelines using
<br>experience gained in the construction of the Blue Stream
<br>pipeline that connects Russia and Turkey under the Eastern portion of
<br>the Black Sea. Additionally, ENI seeks full partnership with
<br>Russia on the South Stream project. GOI and ENI contacts have reported
<br>that the company was having trouble getting a firm Russian
<br>commitment to this South Stream partnership. The plummeting price of
<br>hydrocarbons may have reduced the economic incentives for this project,
<br>but many analysts believe that Russian geo-strategic concerns will
<br>trump business considerations on this project. The most recent
<br>Russia- Ukraine gas dispute seems to have revived interest in the
<br>Nord Stream and South Stream projects, especially among those who see
<br>Ukraine as the problem.
<br>
<br>
<br>Rome 00000097 004 of 005
<br>
<br>
<br>¶15. (C/NF) Italy is not totally blind to the dangers of its
<br>dependence on Russia, however, and it is taking some steps
<br>that may prevent an increase in the percentage of their energy that
<br>they get from Russia. Upon returning to power, Berlusconi announced
<br>that he would return the country to nuclear power. While the GOI
<br>seems serious, this project will require eye-popping expenditures,
<br>long- term commitment, and the resolution of thorny environmental
<br>problems. Some fear that the nuclear project was launched in response
<br>to an oil price of $140 per barrel, and wonder if the Italian
<br>commitment to nuclear power will recede if oil prices stay low. Italy
<br>is also increasing its use of Liquid Natural Gas and is finishing
<br>work on a new terminal in the Northern Adriatic. While
<br>less-than-enthusiastic about the EU's complex Nabucco pipeline, the GOI
<br>seems to be supporting the smaller-scale Turkey-Greece-Italy pipeline
<br>project designed to bring Caspian gas to Western Europe. Edison, a
<br>French company with Italian roots, is trying to determine if it
<br>should commit to this project. While Azeri gas supplies and
<br>Turkey's willingness to allow the gas to flow West are unresolved
<br>issues, Edison believes its project has a chance of succeeding
<br>because unlike Nabucco, it is small enough -- it believes -- not to
<br>provoke opposition from Russia. The GOI -- especially powerful
<br>Minister for Economic Development Scajola -- supports the TGI project
<br>(in fact GOI officials complain if the U.S. sometimes seems to imply
<br>that Nabucco should have priority). There is fear that a successful
<br>launch of South Stream would -- by promising to meet demand -- doom
<br>both South Stream and Nabucco.
<br>
<br>A Foreign Policy Designed to Deny Russia Nothing
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br>
<br>¶16. (C/NF) The combination of historical ideological
<br>sympathy, energy dependence, lack of institutional influence, and a
<br>close personal relationship between Berlusconi and Putin serve to
<br>provide Russia with an apparently trusted ally, overtly willing to work
<br>overtime within the EU on Moscow's behalf. Russia can count on Italy
<br>to support its efforts to remove irritants in its relations with
<br>the West, including:
<br>
<br>- pressure on/within OSCE to overlook Russia's lack of
<br>compliance with its legally binding Istanbul commitments on frozen
<br>conflicts,
<br>- weak support or even opposition to NATO efforts to build
<br>closer ties to Georgia and Ukraine,
<br>- weak initial support for international efforts to recognize
<br>Kosovo's independence,
<br>- unhelpful comments on U.S. bilateral Missile Defense plans
<br>with Poland and Czech Republic,
<br>- support for Russian President Medvedev's plans to redefine
<br>European security architecture to undermine OSCE and NATO.
<br>- support for Russian efforts to undermine EU and US energy
<br>security initiatives for Europe.
<br>
<br>¶17. (C/NF) In the past, Berlusconi's highly-prized personal
<br>relationship with U.S. President Bush was an important
<br>counterweight to Russian influence, but many pro-U.S. Italian party
<br>officials on both sides of the aisle have worried to us that Bush's
<br>departure could tempt Berlusconi to move closer to Russia. For his
<br>part, Berlusconi has publicly stated that he would like to become a
<br>bridge between the U.S. and Russia and to "educate a young and
<br>inexperienced new American president" on how to deal with the Russians.
<br>If the past is any guide, this will likely mean an intensified
<br>effort to press the Russian agenda with the U.S.

<br>
<br>¶18. (C/NF) To tackle the problem head-on, Post has deployed
<br>a robust diplomatic and public affairs strategy targeting key figures
<br>inside and outside government. Our aim is two-fold: educate our
<br>interlocutors more profoundly on Russian activities and thus
<br>the context for U.S. policy, as well as build a counter- weight
<br>of dissenting opinion on Russia policy, especially within
<br>Berlusconi's political party. . Since the beginning of the summer, wit
<br>Berlusconi's return to power and the Georgia crisis, we have
<br>been engaging with GOI leaders aggressively at all levels. Pol,
<br>PA and Econoffs have engaged party members, GOI contacts, think
<br>tanks and even press to provide an alternative narrative to the
<br>Berlusconi insistence that Russia is a democratic and stable country
<br>that has been provoked by the West. The effort seems to be paying
<br>off. The opposition has begun taking jabs at Berlusconi by portraying
<br>him as choosing the wrong side of the debate. Some in the PdL have
<br>begun to approach us privately to say that they would like greater
<br>dialogue with us on the Russia issue, and have indicated their
<br>
<br>Rome 00000097 005 of 005
<br>
<br>
<br>interest in challenging Berlusconi's giddiness about Putin. While we
<br>have a long way to go in changing the narrative, unfortunately, we have
<br>help - in the form of a PM who appears increasingly to be the
<br>mouthpiece of Putin.
<br>
<br>Comment
<br>- - - -
<br>
<br>¶19. (C/NF) The bilateral relationship between the U.S. and
<br>Italy is excellent and encompasses tremendous cooperation
<br>on many levels and on many fronts.
<br>Unfortunately, Berlusconi efforts to "repair" the relationship
<br>between the West and Russia (which as he told the Ambassador in their
<br>farewell meeting on February 23, "sticks in my gut as a large
<br>undigested mass") are threatening his credibility and
<br>becoming a real irritant in our relationship. We can help
<br>get him back on the right track by sending him a clear signal
<br>that the U.S. does not need an interlocutor for its important bilateral
<br>relationship with Russia and that his insistence on undermining existin
<br>structures and channels based on common interests and shared values
<br>within the alliance in exchange for short term stability is not a
<br>strategy Washington wishes to pursue.
