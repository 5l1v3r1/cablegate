<br>SUBJECT: SPAIN: AMBASSADOR MAKES FAREWELL CALL ON FOREIGN
<br>MINISTER
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador George L. Argyros, reasons 1.4(b) and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Ambassador met with Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel
<br>Angel Moratinos November 10 at the Foreign Ministry for a
<br>farewell call. Ambassador began by saying it was time to get
<br>the U.S.-Spain relationship moving forward. Moratinos agreed
<br>and said Spain and the U.S. needed to start working on a
<br>positive agenda. Moratinos said Spain could be helpful in
<br>many areas -- Spain has credibility in the Middle East and
<br>Latin America, for example. Moratinos stated Zapatero wanted
<br>to work with President Bush to move relations forward and
<br>noted that the fact that President Bush had not returned
<br>Zapatero's congratulatory phone call was not playing well in
<br>the media. "We need to improve relations and a return call
<br>would be a good gesture on the U.S.'s part," said Moratinos.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Moratinos also stated the Zapatero government wants
<br>to build on the good relations the Aznar administration
<br>established, not tear them down. Moratinos added, "In this
<br>Ministry, you know we are not always consulted on certain
<br>actions taken by others," likely referring to recent negative
<br>comments about the U.S. by Minister of Defense Jose Bono.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Moratinos said he is committed to working hard on our
<br>bilateral relations, and suggested some topics that could be
<br>brought to the forefront as visible examples of cooperation
<br>between our two countries. Fore example, Spain and the U.S.
<br>could renew the Joint Declaration on Defense Relations signed
<br>by Foreign Minister Pique and Secretary Albright in January
<br>¶2001. Another idea was to celebrate the 10-year anniversary
<br>of the Transatlantic Agenda between the U.S, and the EU,
<br>which was originally a Spanish idea.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Moratinos offered Spain's help in the Middle East.
<br>He said he knows all of the Palestinian leadership. In
<br>particular, he knows Abu Mazen well, and if Mazen is elected
<br>Palestinian president, Moratinos offered to serve as an
<br>intermediary if the U.S. wished. On his recent visit to
<br>Syria, Moratinos said the sole reason he went to Syria was to
<br>ask the Syrians to "behave" with regards to the Palestinians.
<br>More generally, Moratinos noted that the country with the
<br>most experience in the Middle East, Spain, was not invited to
<br>participate in the Forum for the Future to be held in Morocco
<br>in December. He understood why Spain could not attend as
<br>part of the G-8, but said perhaps Spain could go as guests of
<br>the Moroccan government. Spain has excellent relations with
<br>Morocco and with November 2005 being the 10-year anniversary
<br>of the Barcelona Process, it may be appropriate for Spain to
<br>be part of this group. However, Moratinos quickly added that
<br>they would accept a Moroccan invitation only if the U.S. had
<br>no objection.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Ambassador Argyros suggested Spain make a strong
<br>gesture to show its support for the return of democracy to
<br>Iraq. This would not require returning Spanish troops to
<br>Iraq but perhaps the GOS could train a large contingent of
<br>Iraqi police officers in Spain and publicize it widely.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) On Latin America, Moratinos noted that Venezuela's
<br>Chavez would be visiting Spain November 22-23. Moratinos
<br>asked if the U.S. wanted to convey a message to Chavez.
<br>Ambassador asked Moratinos to raise the increasing drug
<br>trafficking problem in Venezuela -- more and more shipments
<br>bound for Europe and the U.S. appear to be departing from
<br>Venezuela. Moratinos welcomed a non-paper if we wanted to
<br>submit one.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) With respect to Afghanistan, Ambassador noted we had
<br>heard the Spanish ambassador to NATO has raised the
<br>possibility that Spain would be willing to staff a Provincial
<br>Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Afghanistan. Moratinos was
<br>aware of the idea but said no decision had been made yet. He
<br>noted it was not "totally unrealistic" Spain would
<br>participate in a PRT.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) The meeting ended with Moratinos informing the
<br>Ambassador he would be traveling to the U.S. early in 2005 to
<br>do "outreach work" with think tanks and government officials,
<br>and hoped to get an assessment of how Spain is thought about
<br>in the U.S.
