<br>CLASSIFIED BY: Rachel Meyers, Deputy Political Counselor, State, POL;
<br>reason: 1.4(a), (b), (d)
<br>
<br>¶1. On December 15, Ambassador Ranneberger discussed the tank
<br>transfer issue with Prime Minister Odinga, who said that the GOK
<br>was committed to assisting the GOSS and that there was "intense
<br>pressure" from the GOSS to deliver the tanks. He hinted that the
<br>GOK might instead transfer the tanks to Uganda (and, he implied,
<br>from there to South Sudan). On December 16, following AF guidance,
<br>Ambassador Ranneberger reiterated to the PM that any further
<br>transfer of the tanks, via Uganda or otherwise, would violate U.S.
<br>law and could trigger sweeping sanctions against Kenya. He also
<br>noted that the likelihood of receiving a waiver for past transfers
<br>of LME to the SPLA since 2007 would be remote if the GOK proceeded
<br>with moving the tanks to Sudan. Ambassador Ranneberger also briefed
<br>Minister of Finance Uhuru Kenyatta on the issue on December 16, and
<br>Kenyatta responded that he understood the U.S. position.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶2. xxxxxxxxxxxx, COL McNevin and DAO notetaker met with xxxxxxxxxxxx. 
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx also attended. McNevin reiterated
<br>the points made by Ambassador Ranneberger to the PM (see para 2)
<br>and noted that we are open to discussing possible future options
<br>for disposition of the tanks so that the GOK is not stuck with
<br>assets it does not need. Before the meeting, xxxxxxxxxxxx mentioned that
<br>in the GOK's view, the tanks belong to the GOSS and that his
<br>government is receiving "increasing pressure" to deliver them. He
<br>added that President Kibaki was personally very angry about this
<br>issue. During the meeting, xxxxxxxxxxxx commented that the GOK was "very
<br>confused" by our position and did not understand why they needed a
<br>waiver, since the past transfers had been undertaken in
<br>consultation with the United States and they thought we were in
<br>agreement on the way forward towards implementation of the CPA. He
<br>added that this was causing a "major problem" between the GOK and
<br>the GOSS. xxxxxxxxxxxx asked about the significance of what appeared to
<br>him to be a major policy reversal, and questioned whether the
<br>United States is rethinking the CPA, increasingly shifting its
<br>support to Khartoum, and/or now seeking a unitary state in Sudan.
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx asked that the United States explain directly to the
<br>GOSS/SPLA why we are blocking the tank transfer. Following that
<br>discussion, xxxxxxxxxxxx indicated the GOK would like to participate in
<br>a high-level trilateral meeting (GOK, GOSS, and USG) to reach a
<br>collective understanding of U.S. and regional partner countries'
<br>objectives with respect to implementation of the CPA.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶3. As McNevin was departing the meeting, xxxxxxxxxxxx called him back and
<br>asked, on xxxxxxxxxxxx behalf, for a list of all DOD programs and
<br>funding for Kenya, due to xxxxxxxxxxxx later today (December 16) in
<br>preparation for an upcoming Defense Council meeting scheduled for
<br>December 21. The Defense Council is chaired by President Kibaki,
<br>and it appears likely that xxxxxxxxxxxx will use the list to underscore
<br>the importance of the U.S.-Kenya mil-mil relationship and to
<br>convince Kibaki not to transfer the tanks. In addition to Kibaki
<br>and xxxxxxxxxxxxx other Defense Council members are NSIS Director
<br>Gichangi, Minister for Defense Haji, Minister for Internal Security
<br>Saitoti, Commandant of the Administration Police Mbugua, and Police
<br>Commissioner Iteere. (Note: The Defense Council is composed
<br>entirely of advisors who are close to the President and come from
<br>his Kikuyu ethnic group or closely related groups. End note.)
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶4. As directed in ref A, the demarche regarding transfer of
<br>Ukrainian-origin LME by the Government of Kenya (GOK) to the Sudan
<br>People's Liberation Army (SPLA) was originally delivered by Deputy
<br>Assistant Secretary for Defense Vicki Huddleston and Kenya-US
<br>Liaison Office Chief COL McNevin to Kenya Assistant Minister for
<br>Defense David Musila and xxxxxxxxxxxx. COL McNevin also discussed the issue
<br>further with the xxxxxxxxxxxx. In addition, the Political RA Chief met
<br>with Director of National Security and Intelligence Service (NSIS)
<br>General Gichangi on the issue on December 16.The GOK
<br>representatives assured DASD Huddleston and COL McNevin that no
<br>tanks would be delivered to the SPLA for the foreseeable future.
<br>(Note: There are 32 T-72 tanks remaining in Kenya from the
<br>shipment that arrived in Mombasa aboard the M/V Faina. End note.)
<br>
<br>Nairobi 00002497 002 of 002
<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. xxxxxxxxxxxx also noted that all other transfers
<br>have been done with full disclosure to the United States, and the
<br>GOK has shared all information regarding these transfers without
<br>hesitation. He further noted that stopping this shipment will
<br>incur "big costs" and that "Salva Kir will not be happy." He went
<br>on to state that the GOK may seek waiver support from the
<br>Government of Southern Sudan (GOSS) and that the basis for the
<br>waiver would be the implementing instructions of the Comprehensive
<br>Peace Agreement (CPA), which allow other nations to support the
<br>modernization and conversion of the SPLA from a guerilla force to a
<br>small conventional civilian military that would be capable of
<br>future integration with the Sudanese national military. As noted in
<br>ref A talking points, McNevin and xxxxxxxxxxxx also briefly discussed
<br>that U.S. legislation does contain a waiver provision. xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>McNevin held a subsequent meeting with xxxxxxxxxxxx at the
<br>Ambassasdor's request and noted that the likelihood of a waiver
<br>being granted by the United States would be remote if the GOK went
<br>ahead with the tank transfer.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶6. Comment: As of 16 December, the 32 T-72 tanks remain on
<br>flatcars at Kahawa Army Barracks in Nairobi. If indeed the tanks
<br>are not going to be transported in the "foreseeable future," we
<br>would expect to see them off-loaded soon and the flatcars returned
<br>to Rift Valley Railroad service. The GOK is understandably
<br>confused, as transfer of these tanks, in their view, dove-tailed
<br>with the goals of the United States to implement the CPA by
<br>converting the SPLA from a guerrilla force to a small conventional
<br>force capable of defending Juba (but not take Khartoum), able to
<br>integrate with a national force, and able to counterbalance the
<br>significant military capacity of Khartoum. Despite the GOK
<br>assurances, there are a number of factors that may lead to the
<br>eventual transfer of the tanks, including: the need to maintain
<br>good relations with South Sudan and keep a friendly ally on Kenya's
<br>unstable northwestern border; the substantial financial losses
<br>Kenya will incur if it does not complete the transfer; the fact
<br>that Kenya has no need to add additional tank assets to its
<br>military; and Kenya's financial and, to a lesser extent,
<br>cultural/ideological links with South Sudan.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶7. Over the past two years, KMOD officials have shared full details
<br>of their engagement with the SPLA as we have shared details of our
<br>training program for the SPLA, including combat arms soldier
<br>training, under a May 2007 Presidential Directive. The GOK views
<br>this as a reversal of U.S. policy that has significant
<br>security,financial, and political implications for them. It is
<br>difficult to persuade the Kenyans that transferring this equipment
<br>to the SPLA violates the terms of the CPA and therefore will merit
<br>sanctions if completed when they are well aware that the United
<br>States is continuing military to military security sector reform
<br>assistance to the SPLA.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶8. We have been pushing the GOK very hard on the civilian side to
<br>bring about reform and good governance, and have sparked mounting
<br>resistance as a result. Despite that pressure and tension, our
<br>military to military relations have been excellent and our
<br>unimpeded access has been of significant benefit to the USG in
<br>terms of counterterrorism and anti-piracy. Given the competing
<br>policy issues on the table, we welcome ideas to defuse this
<br>situation, discuss options for alternative dispositions of the
<br>tanks, and to harmonize the "apparent disconnect" between the CPA
<br>and U.S. legislation mentioned in ref A. We urge Washington to
<br>consider the GOK's request to convene a high-level dialogue with
<br>the GOK, GOSS, and other relevant stakeholders as soon as possible
<br>to foster a clear understanding of U.S. policy and develop a way
<br>forward towards CPA implementation.
