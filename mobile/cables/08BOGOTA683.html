<br>SUBJECT: GOC TO FACILITATE NEW FARC HOSTAGE RELEASE,
<br>REBUFFS FRENCH EFFORT TO SEEK RENEWED ROLE FOR VENEZUELA
<br>
<br>Classified By: Political Counselor John S. Creamer.
<br>Reasons 1.4 b and d.

<br>-------
<br>SUMMARY
<br>-------
<br>¶1. (C) President Uribe said the GOC will facilitate the
<br>possible release of four more political hostages held by the
<br>FARC, including allowing Venezuelan helicopters to use San
<br>Jose de Guaviare airport. Peace Commissioner Restrepo told
<br>us the February 21 meeting with Uribe and French FM Kouchner
<br>was "cordial but frank." Uribe rebuffed three French
<br>attempts to discuss a renewed Venezuelan role in facilitating
<br>a humanitarian accord. Restrepo will meet secretly with the
<br>French, Spaniards, and Swiss in Panama on February 26. The
<br>Spanish are wary of the French and Swiss, and expect little
<br>to come from the Panama meeting. END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>GOC WILL FACILITATE NEW HOSTAGE RELEASE
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>¶2. (U) President Alvaro Uribe confirmed on February 23 that
<br>the GOC has located the four political hostages set to be
<br>released by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
<br>(FARC), but added that the Colombian military would not
<br>interfere with their release. Defense Minister Juan Manuel
<br>Santos had previously announced that the GOC had located the
<br>four--Gloria Polanco, Luis Eladio Perez, Orlando Beltran, and
<br>Jorge Eduardo Gechem--south of San Jose de Guaviare, and near
<br>where Clara Rojas and Consuelo Gonzalez de Perdomo were
<br>released on January 10. Santos said Gechem was in "grave"
<br>physical condition, and urged his immediate release.
<br>Gechem's family announced they will travel to Caracas on
<br>February 27 with Senator Piedad Cordoba in the expectation
<br>that the FARC will release the four in the near future.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Peace Commissioner Luis Carlos Restrepo told us the
<br>hostage recovery operation would likely follow the model used
<br>in the FARC's release of Clara Rojas and Consuelo Gonzalez,
<br>including the use of San Jose de Guaviare airport by
<br>Venezuelan helicopters. The GOC would not try to impose new
<br>conditions due to the intense domestic and international
<br>interest in the four hostages' release. Santos told the
<br>Ambassador he had publicly announced the GOC's knowledge of
<br>the hostages' location to prevent the FARC from blaming
<br>Colombian military operations for delaying the release or
<br>from attributing Gechem's death to GOC obstructionism. On
<br>February 25, Venezuelan Interior Minister Ramon Rodriguez
<br>Chacin accused the GOC of carrying out "intense military
<br>operations" that were complicating the FARC's plans for
<br>release.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------
<br>TENSE GOC MEETING WITH FRENCH OVER VENEZUELA
<br>--------------------------------------------
<br>¶4. (C) Restrepo told us the February 21 meeting between
<br>President Uribe and French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner
<br>was "cordial but frank." Kouchner proposed the creation of a
<br>group of countries, including Venezuela, to facilitate a
<br>humanitarian exchange. Uribe responded that this was not the
<br>time to talk about Venezuela. Restrepo said Kouchner tried to
<br>raise Venezuela two more times during the meeting, only to be
<br>rebuffed by Uribe. In an interview with weekly news magazine
<br>"Semana" published February 24, Kouchner said "Chavez is key
<br>to liberation of the hostages . . . and we think President
<br>Chavez has played a positive role up to now."
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Restrepo said Uribe pressed Kouchner on what France
<br>might contribute to a humanitarian accord, as well as his
<br>proposal to encircle the FARC unit holding the hostages and
<br>to negotiate their release. Kouchner repeated French
<br>skepticism about encirclement, but said France would
<br>contribute economic support and would also accept some FARC
<br>members as part of a negotiated solution.
<br>
<br>----------------------------------
<br>GOC TO MEET FRENCH, SPANISH, SWISS
<br>----------------------------------
<br>¶6. (C) Restrepo told us he will secretly meet with the three
<br>European facilitators--France, Spain and Switzerland-- in
<br>Panama on February 26 to discuss the way forward on
<br>humanitarian negotiations. The GOC has authorized Swiss
<br>representative Jean Pierre Gontard and French representative
<br>Noel Saenz to meet the FARC. Uribe told Kouchner that after
<br>such a FARC-Euro meeting, the GOC could consider a possible
<br>role for Cuba, as well as Brazilian President Lula da Silva,
<br>in support of the European effort.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Separately, Spanish DCM in Bogota Pablo Gomez de Olea
<br>confirmed the Panama meeting and predicted little would be
<br>achieved due to lack of consensus among the three European
<br>countries. Gomez said the French are increasingly desperate
<br>to obtain the FARC's release of Ingrid Betancourt, see
<br>Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez as key, and are prepared to
<br>act without GOC authorization or knowledge. He said the
<br>French would gladly pay the FARC in exchange for Betancourt's
<br>freedom and would also agree to seek the FARC's removal from
<br>the EU terrorism list. The problem is that the FARC does not
<br>want money for Betancourt. Gomez added that the French have
<br>put Spain in an increasingly difficult position by demanding
<br>that Spain choose between supporting France or Colombia.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Gomez told us the Swiss are more moderate than the
<br>French, but are also capable of acting without GOC
<br>authorization. The Swiss are not bound by the EU's terrorist
<br>list, and allow a FARC representative to operate in
<br>Switzerland. Gomez said Spain believes individual Latin
<br>countries do not have the stature or credibility to play a
<br>role in a humanitarian process. Still, Spain believes the
<br>OAS could assume such a role under the right circumstances,
<br>making it important to preserve OAS interest and credibility.
