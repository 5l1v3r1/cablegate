<br> 
<br>1.(C) UK Ambassador to Tehran Geoffrey Adams, in a series of 
<br>meetings with U.S. Embassy Baghdad and MNF-I officials, 
<br>outlined his recommendations on how to negotiate with 
<br>Iranians.  Ambassador Adams thought that Iran had several 
<br>goals from talks with the U.S., both superficial and 
<br>substantive.  In negotiations, he advised being steady and 
<br>firm, tough but not aggressive, and at the same time, seeking 
<br>to engage and draw attention to mutual interests.  He 
<br>outlined Iran,s preconceptions and its obsession with and 
<br>mistrust of  the West, which, he said, can blind it to its 
<br>interests.  He warned that the Iranian participants would 
<br>likely have very strict instructions what they could say and 
<br>that it would be difficult to get them off script, though the 
<br>element of surprise could work.  Adams added that the 
<br>Iranians would be very nervous of negative repercussions if 
<br>they made a misstep, and they would likely report on each 
<br>other.  Answers to questions and proposals would more likely 
<br>only come at follow-on meetings, and decision-making in Iran 
<br>is slowed by the need for consensus, so patience is needed. 
<br>That said, it was important to rid the Iranians of their 
<br>standard notion that time was on their side.  End summary 
<br> 
<br>2.(C) British Ambassador to Iran Geoffrey Adams offered 
<br>advice in negotiating strategies with Iran in a series of 
<br>meetings with U.S. officials and military officers in Baghdad 
<br>November 24-25.   The following is an amalgamation of three 
<br>meetings, held in advance of the fourth round of 
<br>Iran-Iraq-U.S. trilateral discussions on Iraq.  Adams, who 
<br>has served in Tehran for almost two years, said his 
<br>observations were borne of much experience, to include a 
<br>&master class8 when Iran captured at gunpoint 15 British 
<br>Navy personnel in March 2007.  British Ambassador to Kuwait 
<br>Stuart Laing also joined the discussions, as well as British 
<br>First Secretary in Tehran Alex Pinfield.  Among those present 
<br>on the U.S. side at various briefings were Ambassador 
<br>Crocker, MNF-I Commanding General Petraeus, Pol-Mil Minister 
<br>Counselor Ambassador Marcie Ries, MG Kevin Bergner, Special 
<br>Advisor David Pearce, and IRPO Director Jillian Burns.  The 
<br>British ambassador,s views of Iran,s strategic interests 
<br>and the internal political situation to be reported septel. 
<br> 
<br>3.(C) Iranians, goal, in Adams, view, is to 
<br>institutionalize talks with the U.S. and keep open the 
<br>possibility of broadening the agenda.  While he heard that 
<br>the Iranians were disappointed in the &lack of substance8 
<br>in previous bilateral talks with the U.S, they felt they 
<br>derived good publicity from participating.  Adams predicted 
<br>the Iranians will seek to keep them going both to engender 
<br>their prestige and to keep tabs on what the USG is thinking. 
<br>He also thought the talks had triggered a useful internal 
<br>debate in how to make the best use of the talks and their 
<br>strategic interests.  Adams added that he believed there is a 
<br>significant lobby in Iran against holding talks with the U.S. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Assumptions 
<br>--------------- 
<br> 
<br>4.(C) In talks with Iranians, Ambassador Adams recommended 
<br>being steady and firm, tough but not aggressive, and at the 
<br>same time, seeking to engage.   He stressed that Iranians are 
<br>obsessed with the West and this obsession at times blinds 
<br>them to their interests.  In this light, the US side should 
<br>be aware of the following preconceptions on the Iranian side: 
<br> 
<br>-- the USG seeks to remove the current regime and replace it 
<br>with a pro-Western one. 
<br> 
<br>-- USG policymakers spend an inordinate amount of time and 
<br>energy thinking about (and plotting against) Iran.  As such, 
<br>Iranians assume that everything we do or say has meaning and 
<br>has been carefully thought out and coordinated, both 
<br>internally and with the UK; there are no accidents. 
<br> 
<br>-- The current U.S. administration is politically very weak, 
<br>facing major internal opposition, and as such, the threat of 
<br>US military action against Iran is not realistic. 
<br> 
<br>-- Iran sees the U.S. as a tough, determined adversary that 
<br>can be manipulated and wounded. 
<br> 
<br>Mistrust 
<br>---------- 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>BAGHDAD 00003895  002.4 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>5.(C) The legacy of the Iran-Iraq war, when the international 
<br>community was either silent or sided with Saddam (even when 
<br>he used WMD against Iranians) must be kept in mind.  Iranians 
<br>mistrust the outside world, to include the very same Western 
<br>powers and Sunni Arab states that are now seeking to ensure 
<br>that pro-Iranian Shias do not dominate  power in Iraq. 
<br> 
<br>Short Leash 
<br>-------------- 
<br> 
<br>6.(C) Islamic Republic of Iran (IRI) government negotiators 
<br>arrive with precise and detailed instructions from which they 
<br>do not deviate, out of fear of professional repercussions. 
<br>They will go through all their talking points.  The USG 
<br>should not expect substantive responses to questions or 
<br>initiatives in real time.  This problem can be obviated to an 
<br>extent by scheduling &lots of breaks,8 allowing IRIG 
<br>officials time to confer amongst themselves and to seek 
<br>guidance via telephone from Tehran.  However, given the fear 
<br>of a misstep on the IRI side, the USG should not expect real 
<br>engagement from the IRI outside of their instructions. 
<br>Answers to questions and responses to suggestions are likely 
<br>to come at follow-on meetings, although some questions never 
<br>get answered. 
<br> 
<br>Preparation 
<br>-------------- 
<br> 
<br>7.(C) IRIG officials will likely prepare in detail for the 
<br>talks.  They may consult with Iranians with extensive 
<br>experience with Americans, such as academics who have 
<br>participated in Track Two talks or worked in the U.S.  He 
<br>also mentioned that the head of Iran,s Chamber of Commerce 
<br>Mohammad Nahavandian is also perceived as a U.S. expert and 
<br>is likely consulted.  Adams doubted that Iran would seek 
<br>advice in negotiating with Americans from other countries. 
<br>Adams repeatedly said, &Iranians are not stupid,8 meaning 
<br>they follow all the issues closely, even if they at times 
<br>misread the signals. 
<br> 
<br>Slow Process 
<br>---------------- 
<br> 
<br>8.(C) In light of the short leash negotiators have, plus the 
<br>collaborative and multi-polar nature of IRI decision-making 
<br>and the extreme sensitivity of the topic of direct USG-IRIG 
<br>talks, the USG should not expect immediate &big steps.8 
<br>Any progress will be slow and come only after much 
<br>deliberation and discussion in Iran, with push-back from 
<br>those circles opposing talks.  If the IRIG concludes that a 
<br>policy shift is in their interests, it can do it and find a 
<br>way to justify it, but will first have to achieve internal 
<br>consensus. 
<br> 
<br>Stay Calm 
<br>------------ 
<br> 
<br>9.(C) It is important with the Iranians not to lose one,s 
<br>temper or show that one is upset.  Trading accusations allows 
<br>the IRIG to rely on a familiar script; far better is to ask 
<br>unexpected questions that will take them &off-script.8 
<br>When asked how to best broach continued IRIG support of JAM 
<br>splinter groups despite IRIG assurances to the Government of 
<br>Iraq to stop the flow of weapons, Adams recommended keeping 
<br>the tone  matter-of-fact and raising issues in question form, 
<br>i.e. &given your assurances that you are seeking to help 
<br>Iraqi forces re-establish peace and security, how can we 
<br>explain the ongoing training of JAM-related illegal 
<br>combatants in Iran?8 
<br> 
<br>Agenda 
<br>--------- 
<br> 
<br>10.(C) Don,t offer an agenda beforehand, otherwise the 
<br>agenda itself will become subject to ongoing negotiations. 
<br> 
<br>Establish Mutual Interests 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>11.(C) Seek to show a commonality or intersection of national 
<br>interests that will justify Iran taking actions suggested by 
<br>the USG.  Prove to them that &if we fail in Iraq, they fail 
<br>too.8  Draw them out on their contradictory tactics in order 
<br>to spark debate within the IRIG.  Assess what the Iranians 
<br>want out of the talks, beyond their publicly stated position 
<br>of wanting a timetable for a withdrawal of foreign troops. 
<br> 
<br>BAGHDAD 00003895  003 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Clock Ticking 
<br>----------------- 
<br> 
<br>12.(C) IRIG interlocutors assume that time is on their side 
<br>and hence default towards inaction.  Convince them that now 
<br>is the time to act, and that not doing so will hurt their 
<br>interests and that the situation could get worse.  In a 
<br>related vein, the IRI must be convinced that the USG is 
<br>prepared to stop dialogue (although not necessarily close the 
<br>channel) if there is no progress.  At the same time, realize 
<br>internally that the negotiators cannot take a bold move 
<br>without consultation, a reasonable degree of patience is 
<br>required, and progress may take time. 
<br> 
<br>Put the Ball in Their Court 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>13.(C) Ask a lot of questions, always put the ball back in 
<br>their court.  Doing so will encourage internal discussion and 
<br>debate in Tehran, as well as put pressure on them to deviate 
<br>from their prepared script.  Wrong foot them by saying 
<br>something unexpected to try to take them off script.  Focus 
<br>on accountability, asking for clarifications of actions that 
<br>contradict their stated commitments.  Keep your message 
<br>clear, including redlines, and do not be too subtle. 
<br> 
<br>Weaknesses 
<br>-------------- 
<br> 
<br>14.(C) Despite their rhetoric, Iranians understand their 
<br>weaknesses include a lack of allies and foreign investment. 
<br> 
<br>Publicity 
<br>---------- 
<br> 
<br>15.(C) Iran is very sensitive to press coverage that makes 
<br>them look weak.  At the same time, the IRIG has a &high 
<br>threshold for embarrassment8 when they are accused of 
<br>illicit activities.  After the talks, the IRIG will seek to 
<br>present the exchange as &businesslike,8 with the US and 
<br>Iran on equal footing, where the IRIG &gave nothing away.8
