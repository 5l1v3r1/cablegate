<br>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR PM GILANI'S VISIT TO WASHINGTON 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Anne W. Patterson, for reasons 1.4 (b)(d) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) Summary. Prime Minister Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani 
<br>will be anxious to prove that he is committed to fighting 
<br>"Pakistan's war" on terrorism and will outline the GOP's 
<br>partial response to the July demands presented by CJCS 
<br>Mullen/DDCIA Kappes. Gilani will publicly support the 
<br>coaliton's "negotiations first" counter-terrorism strategy 
<br>and defend Pakistani sovereignty in the face of reported 
<br>plans for unilateral U.S. action. Privately, he will agree 
<br>that force is sometimes necessary and assert he is prepared 
<br>to use it. However, coalition strains and governance 
<br>gridlock are limiting Gilani's ability to coordinate either 
<br>security or economic policy. He likely will repeat requests 
<br>for "actionable intelligence" and suggest the need for 
<br>increased U.S./ISAF operations on the Afghan side of the 
<br>border. We should maintain pressure for specific 
<br>counter-terrorism (CT) action and condition future Foreign 
<br>Military Financing (FMF) assistance on Pakistani agreement to 
<br>training that will increase its counter-insurgency 
<br>capabilities. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C/NF) Summary continued. Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz 
<br>(PML-N) leader Nawaz Sharif has used his "go Musharraf go" 
<br>campaign to become Pakistan's most popular leader today. To 
<br>bolster his sagging Pakistan People's Party (PPP) popularity, 
<br>PM Gilani may ask for quiet support of a dignified exit 
<br>(resignation) for President Musharraf; in contrast, Musharraf 
<br>has asked that we reaffirm U.S. support for him as President. 
<br>Musharraf continues to debate dissolving the National 
<br>Assembly, a step we believe will lead to widespread unrest 
<br>and increase calls for his departure. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C/NF) Summary continued. Gilani likely will ask for 
<br>faster delivery of Coalition Support Fund (CSF) 
<br>reimbursements, endorse the Biden/Lugar bill to double 
<br>economic aid to Pakistan, and support passage of 
<br>Reconstruction Opportunity Zone (ROZ) legislation. He will 
<br>welcome offers of food security and energy assistance to help 
<br>overcome rising food and fuel inflation and rolling power 
<br>blackouts. He may ask for support to convince Riyadh to 
<br>agree to Pakistan's request to defer $5.9 billion in oil 
<br>payments. Gilani fully supports efforts to repair strained 
<br>relations with Afghanistan and India. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>Filling a Leadership Vacuum 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C/NF) Prime Minister Yousuf Gilani is well-meaning, 
<br>pro-American and anxious to convince us that he is committed 
<br>to fighting "Pakistan's war" against terrorism. The 
<br>challenge is turning good intentions into sustainable action. 
<br>Gilani presides over a fragile coalition mired in governance 
<br>gridlock over the issue of President Musharraf's future. The 
<br>real centers of power -- PPP Co-Chair Asif Zardari and PML-N 
<br>leader Nawaz Sharif -- sit outside government fighting for 
<br>political supremacy. Gilani supports what has been improving 
<br>Ministry of Interior CT cooperation, but he has limited power 
<br>to force the Army and the intelligence services 
<br>(Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI)) to battle a growing 
<br>militant insurgency. His visit to the White House may well 
<br>empower him to do more. With the withdrawal of Nawaz 
<br>Sharif's economic ministers, the coalition lacks the 
<br>expertise to tackle spiraling debt, food and fuel inflation, 
<br>capital flight, and rolling blackouts. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C/NF) Gilani will be seeking public assurances that the 
<br>U.S. supports Pakistan's new civilian government, but the 
<br>uneasy Zardari-Nawaz marriage of convenience may not last 
<br>much longer. When the coalition breaks apart, Zardari will 
<br>need to bolster his slim parliamentary majority with other 
<br>partners. President Musharraf believes his party can be one 
<br>of those partners, and we agree. But his "go Musharraf go" 
<br>campaign has made Nawaz Sharif the most popular leader in 
<br>Pakistan today. Zardari and Gilani fear they cannot 
<br>politically afford to continue working with Musharraf and may 
<br>raise this in Washington. In contrast, Musharraf has asked 
<br>that the USG make it clear to Gilani that the U.S. continues 
<br>to support him as President. Chief of Army Staff General 
<br>Kayani prefers to remain out of politics, if for no other 
<br>reason than a reluctance to take on twin security and 
<br>economic crises. We believe he will support Musharraf's 
<br>resignation with dignity, if the prospect of impeachment 
<br>becomes real. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C/NF) Musharraf continues to debate the possibility of 
<br>dissolving the National Assembly and imposing a technocratic 
<br>government; we believe this scenario will provoke unrest and 
<br>increase calls for Musharraf's departure. We should support 
<br>Gilani now and through a coalition breakup. Nawaz currently 
<br>does not have the votes to bring down the coalition. 
<br>
<br>Fulfilling Promises 
<br>------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S/NF) We have learned since 9/11 that Pakistan 
<br>responds, periodically, to U.S. pressure on 
<br>counter-terrorism; we should continue to press for action on 
<br>specific agenda items. The GOP has responded to the CJCS 
<br>Mullen/DDCIA Kappes visit in July by arresting several 
<br>Taliban shura members in Quetta, signed an agreement to 
<br>install cellphone towers in the tribal areas (FATA), is 
<br>initiating an Army operation in North Waziristan, and we 
<br>expect they will allow another B-300 surveillance aircraft to 
<br>operate. These steps will help disrupt cross-border attacks 
<br>and improve our intelligence capabilities. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (S/NF) However, the GOP has not targeted Siraj Haqqani 
<br>or his network; nor have they arrested Commander Nazir or 
<br>Gulbaddin Hekmatyar. These militants are responsible for 
<br>much of the 40 percent increase in cross-border attacks on 
<br>our troops in Afghanistan this year. The Army/ISI can do the 
<br>job, but they cling to "old think" -- the belief that it is 
<br>better to manipulate militants through infiltration, payoffs 
<br>and "divide and conquer" strategy than fight extremists on 
<br>the battlefield. They fear military action would provoke a 
<br>tribal war they cannot control, but the GOP strategy has 
<br>failed and the government is losing territory to extremists 
<br>every day. While acknowledging that elements of ISI may be 
<br>out of control, Musharraf and Kayani remain reluctant to 
<br>replace ISI Director Nadeem Taj. 
<br>
<br>Bolstering CT Strategy 
<br>---------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C/NF) Gilani will proudly explain the GOP's 
<br>three-pronged CT strategy: political engagement; economic 
<br>development; and force when needed. He likely will claim 
<br>recent (minimal) Frontier Corps action in the tribal areas 
<br>(Hangu and Bara) and (weak) coalition concensus as evidence 
<br>of GOP resolve to execute that strategy. We should 
<br>acknowledge Pakistani sacrifices in the war on terror. 
<br>Gilani believes the coalition must build popular support for 
<br>military action, and General Kayani agrees. But we should 
<br>stress that militants are exploiting the coalition's 
<br>"negotiations first" policy to plan and launch attacks 
<br>against Pakistani and U.S. targets. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (S/NF) Gilani will repeat GOP requests for "actionable 
<br>intelligence" and may suggest that the U.S. and ISAF beef up 
<br>border patrols and stop the drug trade in Afghanistan that 
<br>finances arms and militant operations. We should respond 
<br>that the GOP knows better than we do the location of Haqqani, 
<br>Nazir and Hekmatyar; most al Qaeda and Taliban sanctuaries 
<br>are in Pakistan, not Afghanistan. If Gilani suggests 
<br>improved regional (especially Gulf) intelligence sharing, we 
<br>should welcome that initiative. Zardari has just proposed to 
<br>us a September conference hosted by the UAE with Pakistan, 
<br>India, Afghanistan, the U.K., the U.S., and NATO observers to 
<br>discuss the situation in the tribal areas and along the 
<br>border. This idea has merit, too. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C/NF) Gilani will thank the U.S. for its five-year 
<br>$750 million FATA development program and may ask for more. 
<br>Despite security challenges, USAID is implementing small 
<br>projects in five of the seven FATA agencies that will 
<br>eventually create 120,000 short-term jobs for young Pashtuns 
<br>who otherwise would be tempted to join the Taliban. USAID 
<br>is developing a program to preposition relief packages to 
<br>deliver (in the GOP's name) to villages after military 
<br>action; we should encourage the GOP to increase its own 
<br>civil-military programs to provide relief as part of its 
<br>counter-insurgency (COIN) strategy. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C/NF) Largely because of pride, the Pakistani Army 
<br>remains reluctant to accept COIN training for itself or the 
<br>badly trained and under-equipped Frontier Corps. We should 
<br>tell Gilani that future FMF support will be conditioned on 
<br>the GOP's willingness to accept COIN and close air support 
<br>training. We should assure Gilani that we will continue 
<br>current efforts to train and equip para-military forces like 
<br>the Levies and push him to accept pending training for the 
<br>Frontier Corps. Pakistan now has six military officers 
<br>working in the tripartite Torkham Border Coordination Center 
<br>(BCC); we should press for Gilani's concurrence to identify 
<br>two BCC sites in Pakistan. Gilani may raise the Pakistani 
<br>request to use FMF for F-16 mid-life upgrades; we currently 
<br>are seeking Congressional support for this request. 
<br>
<br>Fixing the Economy 
<br>------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶13. (C/NF) Economic growth for the current fiscal year is 
<br>expected to be 5.8 percent, well below the target of 7.2 
<br>percent. The fiscal deficit is projected to be 7 percent of 
<br>GDP versus a target of 4 percent; GOP borrowing from the 
<br>State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has reached an all-time high of 
<br>USD 8 billion. Pakistan's trade deficit rose to USD 17 
<br>billion, up from USD 11 billion last year, as lackluster 
<br>export growth fell far short of increasing imports. Savings 
<br>and foreign investment both declined. Pakistan's rupee has 
<br>lost 16.8 percent of its value since January and is at record 
<br>lows. We support approval of a pending USD 500 million World 
<br>Bank loan for Pakistan, conditioned on a coherent plan for 
<br>reducing food and energy subisidies. Gilani may ask for 
<br>speedier delivery of Coalition Support Fund reimbursements 
<br>(approximately USD 1 billion per year) and endorse the 
<br>recently introduced Biden/Lugar bill to double economic aid 
<br>to Pakistan. 
<br>
<br>¶14. (SBU) Not a single megawatt of electricity has been 
<br>added to the national grid since 2000, despite population 
<br>growth and economic expansion. Industrial production is 
<br>threatened by blackouts and unemployment is rising. Petroleum 
<br>and electricity subsidies account for the bulk of the fiscal 
<br>deficit and have continued to rise with skyrocketing 
<br>international oil prices. The GOP is paying USD 554 million 
<br>per month for subsidies on petroleum and will attempt to 
<br>reduce these subsidies despite the intense popularity of such 
<br>measures. Energy accounts for 29.3 percent of Pakistan's 
<br>imports, and growth in exports cannot cover the increases in 
<br>international commodity prices. Saudi Arabia is considering 
<br>a Pakistani request to defer $5.9 billion in oil payments; 
<br>Gilani may request help in convincing Riyadh to agree. USAID 
<br>will launch a three year program to assist with energy policy 
<br>issues and energy efficiency and we are offering to fund a 
<br>USGS mapping survey to identify commercial mineral deposits 
<br>and potential energy sources. Gilani will attend in 
<br>Washington a World Bank investment roundtable focused on 
<br>developing Pakistan's Thar coal field reserves. 
<br>
<br>¶15. (U) Gilani will welcome the USG offer of food 
<br>assistance; he estimates that Pakistan needs help obtaining 
<br>3.5 million metric tons of wheat to stave off shortages this 
<br>year. Pakistanis have suffered monthly double digit food 
<br>price inflation since September 2007. Over 100 million 
<br>Pakistanis live on less than 2 dollars per day, including 25 
<br>million living on less than one dollar per day. The World 
<br>Food Program recently identified Pakistan as one of 40 
<br>countries at risk of food insecurity and recently raised its 
<br>estimate of at-risk individuals from 60 to 77 million, or 48 
<br>percent of Pakistan's population. 
<br>
<br>Repairing Regional Security 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶16. (C/NF) Zardari strongly supports improved ties with 
<br>India, irrespective of progress on Kashmir. Gilani called 
<br>Indian PM Singh this week and has agreed to meet with both 
<br>Singh and President Karzai in Sri Lanka following the 
<br>Washington trip. Gilani has approved the list of Pakistani 
<br>participants to the mini-jirga with Afghanistan. India and 
<br>Pakistan initiated the fifth round of their Composite 
<br>Dialogue in July and agreed to expand confidence building 
<br>measures in Kashmir. Gilani may ask for more pressure on 
<br>Congress for passage of Reconstruction Opportunity Zone 
<br>legislation which would benefit both Afghanistan and 
<br>Pakistan. 
<br>
<br>¶17. (C/NF) However, increased allegations of ISI involvement 
<br>in the July 7 bombing of the Indian Embassy in Kabul have 
<br>undermined regional relations. India and Pakistan are 
<br>investigating the incident; we are working with Kabul to 
<br>restart Pak-Afghan economic and military meetings cancelled 
<br>in the wake of the bombing. If asked, Gilani will state that 
<br>Pakistan will not impede approval of the India-IAEA 
<br>Safeguards Agreement. But Pakistan clearly would like 
<br>similar USG assistance to develop its own civilian nuclear 
<br>capability to meet growing energy demand. Negotiations 
<br>continue on the proposed Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline. 
<br>
<br>¶18. (C/NF) We were disappointed that the Islamabad High 
<br>Court increased personal freedoms for Pakistani nuclear 
<br>scientist AQ Khan; if asked, Gilani will say that the GOP 
<br>continues to closely monitor Khan's activities.
