<br>------- 
<br>SUMMARY 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) A senior MFA official convoked the German, Italian 
<br>and Spanish Chiefs of Mission June 19 to inform them the GOT 
<br>wants the Tunisian detainees in Guantanamo Camp returned 
<br>home. According to the European COMs, the implicit message 
<br>was that their governments should not accept the US request 
<br>to take Tunisian detainees. The COMs have informed their 
<br>capitals, but have no response yet. In a meeting June 22, a 
<br>small group of Ambassadors (including the German and Italian 
<br>COMs) discussed the MFA demarches. Among the Ambassadors, 
<br>views differed on the risks to Tunisian prisoners, but some 
<br>said there is a possibility of torture or mistreatment for 
<br>anyone accused of terrorism. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>------------------- 
<br>EUROPEANS DEMARCHED 
<br>------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) Following FM Abdallah's meeting on Guantanamo 
<br>detainees with Ambassador Godec on June 18 (Ref A), the MFA 
<br>convoked German Ambassador Horst-Wolfram Kerll, Italian 
<br>Ambassador Antonio D'Andria and Spanish Charge Santiago 
<br>Miralles Huete to separate meetings on June 19. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) In the meetings, MFA Secretary of State for Maghreb, 
<br>Arab and African Affairs Abdelhafidh Hergeum delivered a 
<br>demarche similar to that given to Ambassador Godec, 
<br>specifically: 
<br>-- Tunisia wants its citizens in Guantanamo returned, 
<br>-- Tunisia does not torture and has signed the Convention 
<br>Against Torture, 
<br>-- Tunisia's image would suffer if the detainees were sent to 
<br>other countries. 
<br>The implicit message from Hergeum, according to the European 
<br>COMs, was that their countries should not agree to the US 
<br>request to accept Tunisian detainees. The three officials 
<br>have informed their capitals but have no response. According 
<br>to the German Ambassador, the Tunisian Ambassador in Berlin 
<br>has delivered the same demarche to the German MFA. 
<br>
<br>------------------- 
<br>AMBASSADORS' MEETING 
<br>------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) On June 22, Ambassador discussed the GOT demarche 
<br>with Ambassador Kerll, Ambassador D'Andria, UK Ambassador 
<br>Chris O'Connor, French Ambassador Serge Degallaix, and 
<br>Canadian Ambassador Bruno Picard. Ambassador Godec reviewed 
<br>the Foreign Minister's demarche with the German and Italian 
<br>Ambassadors then detailing the demarches they had received. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) The Canadian Ambassador noted the GOT has offered, 
<br>as evidence that it does not torture, the case of Imam Said 
<br>Jaziri who was repatriated from Canada to Tunisia despite 
<br>allegations that he would be mistreated. The Canadian 
<br>Ambassador said the comparison between Jaziri and the 
<br>Guantanamo detainees is "crap", explaining that Jaziri was a 
<br>petty criminal and not accused of terrorism. The Canadian 
<br>government reviewed Jaziri's case carefully and decided he 
<br>could be transferred since he did have links with terrorism. 
<br>The Canadian decision, Picard suggested, might well have been 
<br>otherwise if Jaziri had been accused of terrorism. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) The Italian Ambassador said Italy had had few 
<br>problems with individuals they had transferred to Tunisia. 
<br>The Italians have been in contact with their families and 
<br>lawyers and have not heard any serious complaints. Why, he 
<br>asked, would the GOT want to mistreat or torture transferred 
<br>Guantanamo detainees? 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S/NF) Ambassador Godec noted that there are credible 
<br>
<br>reports of one of the first two transferees being mistreated, 
<br>including information from the lawyer, the family and 
<br>statements in open court. Moreover, there are credible 
<br>reports of Ministry of Interior officials mistreating 
<br>detainees and prisoners in other cases. He added that 
<br>contrary to GOT claims, the ICRC cannot visit all Tunisian 
<br>prisons as it does not have access to non-notified MOI 
<br>facilities. The UK Ambassador opined that the GOT uses 
<br>torture as a form of punishment. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (S/NF) The Canadian Ambassador said the GOT's statements 
<br>that it does not torture are "bullshit." The Canadian 
<br>Ambassador (protect) said he had direct, first hand evidence 
<br>of torture/mistreatment of a prisoner that lasted several 
<br>months. The Canadian and German Ambassadors agreed that 
<br>anyone in Tunisian prisons on terrorism charges is at risk of 
<br>mistreatment or torture. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (S/NF) The Ambassadors concluded the discussion with 
<br>several noting that Tunisian diplomatic assurances regarding 
<br>appropriate treatment of prisoners is of value, but that a 
<br>follow-up mechanism is required to ensure commitments are 
<br>kept. 
<br>
<br>------- 
<br>COMMENT 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶10. (S/NF) The GOT clearly and strongly wants the Tunisian 
<br>detainees in Guantanamo returned home. As we suggested in 
<br>Ref A, Washington agencies may wish to consider whether to 
<br>offer to return the Tunisian detainees if the GOT agrees to 
<br>permit US access to the first two transferees and ongoing 
<br>access to any future transferees. Such an understanding 
<br>would need to include a mechanism to address the problems 
<br>that may arise. While there is no absolute guarantee against 
<br>mistreatment, such an understanding would provide transferees 
<br>additional protection. Whether the GOT would accept such an 
<br>arrangement is another matter. We are not optimistic, but it 
<br>is worth considering. If Washington decides to continue with 
<br>efforts to transfer the Tunisian detainees to third 
<br>countries, we need to officially inform the GOT at a 
<br>high-level and soon.
