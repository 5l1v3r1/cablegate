<br>
<br>Summary 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) Over the last six weeks, President Ortega has made an 
<br>uncharacteristically intense effort to pass messages of 
<br>conciliation and cooperation in our direction. Ortega's actions 
<br>include renewed cooperation on some dormant legal assistance 
<br>requests, especially cordial treatment of visiting VIPs, a possible 
<br>decision on a new Ambassador-designate, and a personal and quick 
<br>response to the Ambassador's request for information from Ortega 
<br>regarding the Secretary's planned trip to the region. Yet, over 
<br>the past three years, such "good" behavior by Ortega has occurred 
<br>only when he sought a particular political objective - e.g. the 
<br>early-2009 "charm offensive" that unsuccessfully sought to prevent 
<br>the partial termination of Nicaragua's MCC compact. The motivation 
<br>behind the current "charm offensive" is still unclear, but is 
<br>unlikely to portend a new, friendly Ortega with whom we can work in 
<br>the long-term. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>GON Has Been Cooperative Lately 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) Over the last few weeks, we have noted a concerted effort 
<br>by President Daniel Ortega and First Lady Rosario Murillo to send 
<br>conciliatory signals our way. In late-January we were contacted by 
<br>the Foreign Ministry seeking to re-engage us on a renewal of the 
<br>Status of Forces Agreement governing U.S. troop presence in 
<br>Nicaragua (REF A). At about the same time, the Foreign Minister and 
<br>the Attorney General both indicated to the Ambassador that the 
<br>government desired to be helpful on some long-stagnant evidence 
<br>transfers requests we had made in 2009 (REF F). We also learned 
<br>that Ortega recently approached Arturo Cruz, Jr, the former 
<br>Ambassador to the U.S., about returning for a second tour as 
<br>Managua's representative in Washington, a post that has been vacant 
<br>since Cruz himself left it in March 2009 (details SEPTEL). Ortega, 
<br>through Cruz, has also invited WHA DAS Julissa Reynoso to visit 
<br>Managua. Additionally, both Ortega and Murillo were exceptionally, 
<br>and uncharacteristically, friendly to the U.S. Delegation, led by 
<br>DASD Dr. Frank Mora, that attended the February 22 change of 
<br>command ceremony for Nicaragua's Military High Command. Both 
<br>Ortega and Murillo spent several minutes with the USDEL prior to 
<br>the ceremony and were effusive in their praise of U.S. mil-to-mil 
<br>assistance. This string of events taken together, over the past 
<br>six weeks, represents an unusually friendly level of communication 
<br>and interaction by the Ortega government. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) On Friday, February 19, per instructions from Washington, 
<br>the Ambassador contacted the President's office to inquire whether 
<br>Ortega would participate in a proposed meeting between the 
<br>Secretary and Central American heads of state that would take place 
<br>in Guatemala during the first week of March. Normally our requests 
<br>
<br>MANAGUA 00000115 002 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>of this nature go unanswered. However, within a few hours of 
<br>making this initial contact, First Lady Murillo personally called 
<br>the Ambassador seeking more information about the meeting. She 
<br>also asked the Ambassador to visit the Ortega residence, which also 
<br>serves as the Presidential "offices." NOTE: In 2007, Ortega 
<br>refused to occupy Nicaragua's Presidential palace. Instead he 
<br>governs the country - and runs his Sandinista party -- from his 
<br>home. END NOTE. Murillo asked the Ambassador to meet that same 
<br>evening following a Cabinet meeting; however, she later called to 
<br>re-schedule for the afternoon of Saturday, February 20, explaining 
<br>the cabinet meeting had run longer than expected. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Is this really "True Love?" 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) During the Saturday afternoon meeting, the Ambassador found 
<br>the First Couple cordial, even friendly, contrary to past 
<br>experience. Ortega apologized for the attack on the Embassy in 
<br>November (REF C), noting that he had personally intervened with the 
<br>Chief of Police to ensure the Embassy [eventually] had protection 
<br>from anti-riot units (and for the Ambassador himself on the 
<br>following day). When the Ambassador noted our concern over the 
<br>fact that senior FSLN leaders had been seen urging on the violent 
<br>protestors, Ortega somewhat sheepishly acknowledged that at times, 
<br>even he, cannot control his own people. 
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) The Ambassador raised the nearly year-long vacancy at 
<br>Nicaragua's Embassy in Washington, noting that some in Washington 
<br>perceive this as an intentional slight by Managua. Ortega 
<br>responded slyly that he was on the verge of naming - likely in 
<br>March - a new man (or, he noted, even a woman) to fill the post. 
<br>("Tal vez, una embajadora...") The Ambassador also protested 
<br>Ortega's false claims about the U.S. "military occupation" of Haiti 
<br>following the January 12 earthquake (REF B). He told Ortega the 
<br>Secretary had been very angry at Ortega for the malicious comments. 
<br>Ortega responded weakly that he had spoken in ignorance, and that 
<br>he later became aware that other nations had also sent troops. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Turning to the Secretary's proposed Guatemala meeting with 
<br>regional heads-of-state, Ortega expressed concern that U.S. intent 
<br>was to force the issue of Honduras recognition. He restated 
<br>Nicaragua's opposition to recognizing the Lobo government, adding 
<br>that he would do nothing until the various censures on Honduras by 
<br>multilateral bodies - the UN, OAS, SICA, Rio Group, and ALBA. - had 
<br>been lifted. Ortega said he needed more information before 
<br>agreeing, but ended the one-and-one-half-hour meeting on a friendly 
<br>note. The First Couple's good will carried into Sunday, when they 
<br>met with the U.S. delegation attending the change of command 
<br>ceremony for Nicaragua's military high command. Ortega and Murillo 
<br>were careful to spend several minutes chatting with each member of 
<br>the USDel before the ceremony. Even Ortega's remarks, which 
<br>included the typical anti-imperialist screed, were milder than 
<br>normal.

<br>
<br>
<br>What's "Wrong" With Ortega? 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) While Ortega's true motives are only ever fully known to 
<br>himself, over the past three years we have occasionally seen his 
<br>"conciliatory" face, but only as a means to a short-term objective. 
<br>We recall the unsuccessful charm offensive against us in early-2009 
<br>that sought to prevent the partial termination of MCC (REF G). It 
<br>was followed by vicious and malicious public attacks over several 
<br>months, culminating with Ortega's speech at the Army birthday 
<br>celebration, when he accused U.S. forces of genocide (REF E) The 
<br>pattern is a spurt of amity and cooperation that is immediately 
<br>followed by distance, contempt, and even hostility regardless of 
<br>whether his objective is achieved. At times it seems Ortega's 
<br>subsequent "rejection" of his "intended" is more severe when he 
<br>succeeds. Others - the Europeans, Taiwan, Japan, the World Bank 
<br>and the IMF - have received similar treatment, often ahead of 
<br>decisions on funding for foreign assistance or important visits. 
<br>Nearly all have subsequently been spurned. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Is It Frustrated Foreign Policy? 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) One of Ortega's current motives in seeking a "thaw" with us 
<br>may be a reflection of his unsuccessful attempts to wean Nicaragua 
<br>off the "imperialist" aid of the United States and Europe. He is 
<br>keenly aware (and resentful) of Nicaragua's dependence upon outside 
<br>assistance, especially ours. Given his constant anti-U.S. 
<br>rhetoric, the scale and persistence of U.S. aid contrasts greatly 
<br>with that of other patrons Ortega has actively wooed. Three years 
<br>of persistent overtures to Iran have failed to produce anything 
<br>besides ideological capital and a handful of commercial 
<br>delegations. His long-standing ally, Cuba, continues to provide 
<br>medical and educational "brigades" for rural Nicaragua, but these 
<br>rely on Venezuelan funding and the support of their Nicaraguan 
<br>hosts for sustenance. Russia has been Ortega's other promising 
<br>target. His recognition of Georgia's two breakaway republics was 
<br>clearly designed to please Moscow (REF D), and though Moscow has 
<br>recently come through with some limited assistance, including a 
<br>fleet of modern buses and the promise of military aid and 
<br>cooperation, the commitment still falls far short of Cold War 
<br>levels, for which Ortega had hoped. Russian Foreign Minister 
<br>Lavrov was on the ground for less than 24 hours here during his 
<br>mid-February trip. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Is It Unrequited ALBA? 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶9. (S) The ALBA bloc is an increasingly vocal and coordinated 
<br>grouping that demands attention in international fora, both inside 
<br>and outside the Hemisphere. Yet there are indications that the 
<br>Ortega-Chavez revolutionary partnership may be suffering a cold 
<br>snap. Over three years, Chavez has supplied Ortega with nearly a 
<br>billion dollars in badly-needed "assistance," but Ortega's constant 
<br>need for operating cash to off-set forfeited donor assistance is 
<br>likely now wearisome for Chavez who faces growing domestic economic 
<br>
<br>MANAGUA 00000115 004 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>difficulties. The Venezuelan in charge of the joint-venture ALBA 
<br>de Nicaragua (ALBANISA), an umbrella holding company that channels 
<br>Venezuelan funds, was recently "recalled" to Caracas after a series 
<br>of unfortunate public statements about Venezuela's plan and goals 
<br>in Nicaragua. The "dynamic duo" appears to have been strained by 
<br>several factors, including disagreements over how aggressively to 
<br>exploit Zelaya and the Honduras coup and rivalry over who is the 
<br>Hemisphere's rightful heir to Castro's "revolutionary" legacy. 
<br>Both Chavez and Raul Castro came here for the hastily-convened June 
<br>2009 ALBA/SICA/Rio Group meeting that followed the Honduras coup. 
<br>Yet both confirmed for, but failed to attend, Ortega's July 19 gala 
<br>commemorating the 30th anniversary of the Sandinista victory. 
<br>Ortega was also surely stung by the last-minute cancellations of 
<br>both Venezuela and Cuba for the recent military change of command. 
<br>Even so, we do not/not believe that ALBA is in imminent danger of 
<br>collapse. In fact, we are confident that Ortega would not 
<br>recognize Honduras without prior consultation with, even 
<br>authorization by, Chavez. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Comment 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) At this point, we can only speculate as to Ortega's 
<br>underlying aim or motive behind this current amiable countenance. 
<br>We note that in Nicaragua's most famous theatrical work, "El 
<br>Gueguense" (The Old Man), performers hold masks over their faces. 
<br>The theme is deception, and the ubiquitous masks, with their false, 
<br>painted-on smiles, symbolize the mutual distrust between the 
<br>colonial-era indigenous population and their duplicitous Spanish 
<br>overlords. The smiling masks project an outward appearance of 
<br>comity and respect, while true visages and feelings are hidden from 
<br>view. In our experience, Ortega's charm offensives are gueguense - 
<br>short-lived and insincere. Perhaps in the face of 
<br>less-than-successful foreign policy to diversify his donor base, 
<br>and disenchanted with the lack of revolutionary camaraderie within 
<br>the Bolivarian experiment, he simply seeks reassurance that we plan 
<br>to stay on here. We will. And hope this new beginning does not 
<br>end in disappointment, again.
