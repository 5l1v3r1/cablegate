<br>SUBJECT: NORTH KOREAN ASYLUM SEEKERS APPROACH UNHCR 
<br>
<br>REF: A. PARKER/PETTIT E-MAIL 1/4/07 
<br>¶B. STATE 203879 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Political Minister-Counselor Alice G. Wells. 
<br>Reasons 1.4 (b and d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) XXXXXXXXXXXX told us January 12 that
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX was aware of seven North Korean asylum 
<br>seekers in Moscow. XXXXXXXXXXXX said 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX  had passed this information 
<br>during a January 10 meeting with XXXXXXXXXXXX. 
<br>The seven are laborers who had been working in a timber
<br> camp in the Russian Far East, according to Chun. 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX has scheduled interviews for them 
<br>January 18. They are currently in Moscow, and they are being 
<br>cared for by XXXXXXXXXXXX who has previously 
<br>facilitated contacts between UNHCR and other North Korean 
<br>asylum seekers. Thus far, UNHCR has not approached the 
<br>Russian government about this group and does not believe they 
<br>are in imminent danger. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) XXXXXXXXXXXX said that XXXXXXXXXXXX 
<br>had specifically asked XXXXXXXXXXXX whether resettlement
<br> to the United States was an option. XXXXXXXXXXXX responded
<br> to XXXXXXXXXXXX that the chief concern was the safety of 
<br>the asylum seekers and their rapid departure from Russia, which 
<br>had made South Korea the best alternative in the past, according 
<br>to XXXXXXXXXXXX. We emphasized 
<br>that the U.S. was willing to accept UNHCR referrals of North 
<br>Koreans and that this should be presented as an option. 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX agreed to do so. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) COMMENT: Based on XXXXXXXXXXXX involvement, we believe 
<br>this is the group in ref A. The GOR has always indicated 
<br>that it would consider the possibility of facilitating 
<br>resettlement to the U.S. if a specific case arose, and as 
<br>long as it was handled quietly. If the North Koreans are 
<br>declared refugees and seek resettlement in the U.S., this 
<br>would be the first time we would be able to raise specific 
<br>cases with the GOR. We will follow up with UNHCR to ensure 
<br>that U.S. resettlement is presented as an option, as noted in 
<br>ref B. Further details will be reported as they develop. END 
<br>COMMENT.
