<br>SUBJECT: Increased Harassment of Approved Cuban Medical Parolees 
<br>
<br>REF: 09 CARACAS 1374; 09 CARACAS 442 
<br>
<br>CLASSIFIED BY: Robin D. Meyer, Political Counselor, DOS, POL; REASON: 
<br>1.4(B), (D) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Harassment of Cuban Medical parolees has 
<br>increased significantly since December 2009. Recent media 
<br>coverage has exacerbated difficulties experienced by parolees 
<br>attempting to exit Venezuela. These Cuban medical professionals 
<br>who staff President Chavez's flagship medical service program for 
<br>the poor, Barrio Adentro, report that they inflate their patient 
<br>numbers and are required to conduct political work. Cubans who 
<br>have abandoned their Barrio Adentro clinics find it difficult to 
<br>legalize their presence and benefit from basic services. Most 
<br>parolees do make it out of Venezuela, but some undergo a harrowing 
<br>ordeal before being able to exit. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>HARASSMENT OF CUBAN MEDICAL PAROLEES 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) In the last two months, Cubans approved for humanitarian 
<br>parole through the Cuban Medical Professionals Program (CMPP) at 
<br>Embassy Caracas have experienced increased difficulty leaving 
<br>Venezuela through the MaiquetC-a (Caracas) airport. Almost all 
<br>experience some sort of harassment, ranging from passports being 
<br>confiscated to physical and verbal abuse. Many of those who are 
<br>allowed to board their flights to Miami are only able to do so 
<br>after paying sizeable bribes (generally $700-$1000) to Venezuelan 
<br>immigration officials or Cuban officials who are said to be working 
<br>at the airport. From 2009-2010, more than 20 parolees have been 
<br>detained for extensive questioning, which has reportedly included 
<br>verbal and physical abuse, confiscation of official and regular 
<br>passports, strip search, and threats of deportation. Most of those 
<br>Cubans detained are not allowed to proceed to their flights. 
<br>However, there have been no reports of these parolees actually 
<br>being deported to Cuba, and they have all been released after 
<br>several hours of detention. In fact, most parolees eventually make 
<br>it out on a subsequent attempt. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>MEDIA COVERAGE MAKES IT WORSE 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) The problem has been exacerbated by January 2010 news 
<br>coverage of the CMPP in U.S., Venezuelan, and Colombian media 
<br>outlets. Harassment has increased significantly since the first 
<br>article was published in the Miami Herald on January 7 and was 
<br>subsequently picked up by Globovision and other media outlets in 
<br>Venezuela. Some CMP parolees have chosen to transfer their cases 
<br>to Colombia rather than take the risk of leaving via Venezuela. 
<br>Others have simply traveled to Colombia and departed using the 
<br>travel documents issued in Caracas. Since 2009, 10 of those unable 
<br>to fly have crossed the border to Colombia and have flown to Miami 
<br>from BogotC!. There are no reports of harassment once parolees are 
<br>in Colombia. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>FAKE STATISTICS AND POLITICAL WORK 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Post collected the following anecdotal evidence recounting 
<br>the difficulties applicants encounter during and after the mission. 
<br>While in the mission, applicants live off a very a meager stipend 
<br>(967 Bolivares Fuertes per month, approximately $372 USD at the 
<br>official exchange rate) and work six days a week. Doctors are 
<br>required to see 50-70 patients daily, a number unattainable for 
<br>most doctors who, in reality, average 10-20 patients. Almost all 
<br>applicants claim they are forced to doctor their statistics to meet 
<br>these requirements. Many applicants also describe mandatory 
<br>political work, especially around elections, when applicants are 
<br>instructed to read propaganda in clinics and gather potential 
<br>voters. In addition, they are often required to staff politically 
<br>charged health drives on Sundays. (Note: Some Venezuelans have 
<br>accused Barrio Adentro of being primarily a political program. See 
<br>Ref A for more details. End Note.) 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>CUBANS' PLIGHT AFTER ABANDONING THE MISSIONS 
<br>
<br>CARACAS 00000187 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Applicants encounter severe difficulties once they abandon 
<br>the mission. At this point, the applicants are considered illegal 
<br>immigrants and are subject to deportation. Most find it difficult 
<br>to ever legalize their stay in Venezuela or benefit from basic 
<br>services. One applicant gave birth the day after her parole was 
<br>accepted but has been unable to get a Venezuelan passport for her 
<br>child. Officials told her that they are forbidden to give passports 
<br>to "deserters." Other Cubans have not been able to legally marry in 
<br>Venezuela. While there is no confirmed deportation of a parolee, an 
<br>applicant was recently sent back to Cuba as a precautionary measure 
<br>when his girlfriend abandoned the mission. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>CMPP NUMBERS TO DATE 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) From 2006 to 2007, 497 Cubans applied for parole through 
<br>the CMPP at Embassy Caracas. 407 of those applicants were approved, 
<br>70 were denied, and 8 cases are still pending. In 2008, there were 
<br>201 applicants, 154 approvals, 28 denials, and 8 cases are still 
<br>pending. In 2009, Embassy Caracas received 237 applications, 161 
<br>of which were approved, 36 denied, and 40 still pending. There have 
<br>not been any approvals or denials yet in 2010. Since Post began to 
<br>use YY foils instead of transportation letters in March 2009 (due 
<br>to fraud concerns), 277 of such foils have been issued. It 
<br>should be noted that the vast majority of our approved CMPP 
<br>applicants actually do successfully leave Venezuela. Most 
<br>successfully leave on their first attempt flying out of Venezuela 
<br>with a visa foil or travel letter. Those that are initially 
<br>detained have apparently often been able to bribe their way out on 
<br>a subsequent attempt. The rest, as noted above, have made the trek 
<br>to Colombia and been able to get on a flight to Miami. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) COMMENT: Post generally receives CMPP approvals in large 
<br>batches. Given the parole requirements of traveling within 21 days 
<br>of YY foil issuance, many parolees attempt to exit Venezuela during 
<br>the same time period. This creates a situation whereby these 
<br>applicants will travel in waves. Post is unaware whether 
<br>harassment is the result of deliberate Government of the Bolivarian 
<br>Republic of Venezuela (GBRV) guidance or based on the actions of 
<br>individual immigration officers. Certainly, the recent publicity 
<br>about Cuban doctors bribing Venezuelan and Cuban officials has put 
<br>an unwelcome spotlight on the program. Yet it does seem clear that 
<br>the GBRV does not yet systematically attempt to detain all 
<br>parolees. Finally, the information provided by the applicants 
<br>during the interview process appears to corroborate claims from 
<br>many Venezuelans that the Barrio Adentro program is as focused on 
<br>political propaganda as it is on improving health.
