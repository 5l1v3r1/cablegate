<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: At midnight, December 31st, Brazil's F-X 
<br>jet fighter competition will come to an end. Ultimately, a 
<br>decision on the costly program proved to be politically 
<br>untenable for the Lula administration. Given all the urgent 
<br>requirements of Brazil's armed forces, the F-X was an expense 
<br>that was hard to justify. Competitors for the F-X are 
<br>refusing to go down quietly, but they are fighting a losing 
<br>battle. With the end of the F-X, the GOB may review whether 
<br>to purchase less costly used aircraft. In this regard, the 
<br>Lockheed Martin F-16 would have the inside track. However, 
<br>it is possible that the GOB may base a decision on used F-16s 
<br>in the context of its continued questions about the U.S. as a 
<br>reliable supplier. End Summary 
<br>
<br>The F-X Program, RIP 
<br>-------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) On December 31, the Best and Final Offers (BOFAs) 
<br>for the competition to select Brazil's new generation high 
<br>performance jet fighter (F-X) will expire. Despite repeated 
<br>GOB postponements during the past 12 months on a decision, 
<br>the F-X program had still retained a breath of life thanks to 
<br>repeated hints from former Defense Minister Viegas that a F-X 
<br>award decision would be forthcoming. Throughout the process, 
<br>however, the Lula administration was reluctant to commit to a 
<br>choice. With the end of the validity of the BOFAs next week, 
<br>the F-X program will be officially dead. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) The principal cause of the program's demise, most 
<br>observers agree, was the F-X program's steep price tag, 
<br>around $700 million plus for the purchase of a dozen high 
<br>performance aircraft. The huge cost, at a time when the Lula 
<br>administration was engaged in fiscal austerity, made the 
<br>program a politically impossible sell. (Note: The Brazilian 
<br>Congress, which still has not concluded the 2005 budget, has 
<br>not included jet fighters in its budget, and, in fact, 
<br>provides very little money overall for defense. End Note.) 
<br>Yet, until November, more than a few senior Brazilian Air 
<br>Force (FAB) officers held out hope that FAB would get its new 
<br>jets. When Russian President Putin departed Brazil last 
<br>month without a deal in place for the Sukhoi SU-35 -- after 
<br>offering to purchase 50 Embraer commercial aircraft as a deal 
<br>sweetener and certainly dangling a possible agreement on 
<br>ending the Russian embargo on Brazilian beef -- the last best 
<br>chance for new fighter aircraft for FAB left with him 
<br>(reftel). 
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) Other factors contributed to the F-X impasse. The 
<br>Brazilian military's almost insatiable need for weapons 
<br>systems upgrade and procurement required that the GOB triage 
<br>the competing demands for funding. FAB already had been 
<br>granted approval for buying ten new Black Hawk helicopters 
<br>(about $153 million). With both the army and navy biting at 
<br>FAB's heels for funding their own urgent requirements, the 
<br>new jet fighters became a harder sell. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) In view of the lack of any perceived threat, the 
<br>strategic question of whether Brazil needed the F-X whose 
<br>primary purpose was protection of the national capital, has 
<br>received relatively little debate. The program itself 
<br>ultimately owed its continued rationale less to the defense 
<br>of Brasilia than as a tool of national pride, particularly 
<br>following Chile's purchase of F-16s. Even some air force 
<br>generals admit the principal current threat to Brazilian 
<br>sovereignty (from narco-trafficers) can be addressed less 
<br>expensively by other air force elements such as FAB's Super 
<br>Tucanos. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) Meanwhile, F-X competitors are refusing to go down 
<br>without a fight. Planted news articles in praise of one 
<br>aircraft or attacking another (usually the F-16, and the 
<br>alleged, and false, denial by the USG to provide AAMRAM 
<br>capability to Brazil) continue to pop up. The most recent 
<br>example of F-X muckraking is a cover story this week in 
<br>left-leaning nationalist magazine Carta Capital in praise of 
<br>the Mirage 2000 of the Embraer-Dassault consortium. In the 
<br>Carta Capital article, Embraer President Mauricio Botelho, in 
<br>a direct swipe at Lockheed-Martin, is quoted as saying that 
<br>because the USG won't allow it, U.S. companies offer "no 
<br>chance" for transfer of military-related technology -- a 
<br>bizarre comment in the wake of the winning 
<br>Embraer--Lockheed-Martin bid for the development of the U.S. 
<br>Army's Aerial Common Sensor System aircraft. Even Sweden's 
<br>Grippen aircraft has received high profile lobbying with a 
<br>prominent billboard at the entrance to Brasilia airport. 
<br>
<br>Used Aircraft? 
<br>-------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) Throughout much of the long-running F-X 
<br>competition -- while Lockheed Martin's F-16 was one of the 
<br>competitors -- the U.S. company had urged the GOB consider 
<br>the purchase of used F-16s as a significantly less costly 
<br>option to the F-X. Although an attempt by Lockheed-Martin in 
<br>early 2003 to ally with Varig Engineering and Maintenance 
<br>(VEM) for a proposed upgrade of used F-16s fell through, the 
<br>company remains upbeat it will be able to partner with a 
<br>Brazilian firm (possibly Embraer) to craft an attractive used 
<br>aircraft offer. Ultimately, Lockheed Martin believes it can 
<br>provide fully capable F-16 aircraft at less than half the 
<br>cost of the F-X. (Note: One driving factor, however, will be 
<br>the ability of FAB to conduct inter-operable aerial refueling 
<br>for any fighter. Brazil is considering purchasing two or 
<br>three KC-135s to augment their refueling capability. 
<br>Procurement of KC-135s from the U.S. would be a positive 
<br>indicator for purchase of used F-16s. End note.) 
<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU) In recognition that new aircraft will be 
<br>unobtainable, senior FAB leadership, including FAB's probable 
<br>next Commander in Chief, increasingly have come around to 
<br>accepting used F-16s as Brazil's best aircraft option. In 
<br>this context, the F-16 appears to have the inside track over 
<br>other used aircraft options, although there are rumors that 
<br>some in FAB may be looking at procuring used South African 
<br>Cheetahs, a modified Mirage III aircraft one generation older 
<br>than the early F-16 models. Meanwhile, the Brazilian 
<br>Congress which has been absent from the F-X debate, may get 
<br>into the picture. In a discussion with emboffs, a prominent 
<br>Deputy on the National Defense Committee stated he intended 
<br>to hold hearings in 2005 on used fighter aircraft with an eye 
<br>to promoting the F-16 as Brazil's best option. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Comment: We expect that Brazil will continue to 
<br>seek the aquisition of high performance jet fighters for 
<br>reasons of national pride, if nothing else. U.S. Mission 
<br>Brazil will continue to support the used F-16 option as the 
<br>most logical way forward both tactically and economically. 
<br>An increasing number of FAB generals appear to support this 
<br>view. However, even though Brazil has moved forward on the 
<br>purchase of other weapons systems, we suspect the GOB may not 
<br>agree to purchase the F-16 unless it achieves an adequate 
<br>comfort level on all aspects of the bilateral pol-mil 
<br>relationship. As Brazil observes the bite that ASPA is 
<br>taking on countries that do not sign Article 98 agreements, 
<br>it questions about the reliability of the U.S. as a 
<br>supplier/strategic partner will continue, thus further 
<br>complicating the used F-16 aquisition option.
