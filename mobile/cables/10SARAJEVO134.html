<br>
<br>Summary 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) The emergence of a new Bosniak party, led by the 
<br>powerful, reportedly corrupt, and sometimes vindictive media 
<br>mogul Fahrudin Radoncic, is likely to create further rifts in 
<br>the Bosniak political scene, particularly amid the campaign 
<br>for the October 2010 general elections. Radoncic has the 
<br>support of the leader of the Islamic community. Also, 
<br>Radoncic's ownership and direct control of the most 
<br>widely-read daily newspaper in Bosnia will ensure that his 
<br>campaign message is well propagated. Radoncic's reputation 
<br>for questionable business ventures with partners from across 
<br>the political spectrum, combined with his likely desire for 
<br>influence over the judiciary to escape prosecution for 
<br>corruption, suggests that he will seek political alliances 
<br>based on lucrative personal prospects, rather than ideology 
<br>or even ethnic affiliation. Although it is too early to make 
<br>concrete predictions, Radoncic's party is poised to capture 
<br>votes primarily from Haris Silajdzic's Party for BiH (SBiH), 
<br>as well as a wide swath of apathetic voters allured by his 
<br>pledges to fix the economy. End summary. 
<br>
<br>The Man, the Legend 
<br>------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Fahrudin Radoncic rose from relative poverty and 
<br>obscurity after the 1992-95 BiH war to become the founder and 
<br>owner of Bosnia's leading publishing company, Avaz 
<br>Publishing. This company is known especially for its 
<br>production of the country's highest-circulation daily 
<br>newspaper, Dnevni Avaz, but also for a small television news 
<br>show and a number of widely-read magazines, such as Global. 
<br>The success of Avaz has given Radoncic significant control of 
<br>the Bosniak media. Avaz therefore has proven a powerful tool 
<br>against Radoncic's opponents, particularly the police 
<br>authorities investigating his role in corruption scandals. 
<br>Although not a veteran politician himself, Radoncic through 
<br>Avaz has played an active role in politics for over a decade, 
<br>with Bosniak political candidates vying for his media 
<br>support. Candidates whom Avaz endorses for the Bosniak 
<br>member of the Tri-Presidency -- most recently, Party for BiH 
<br>(SBiH) chairman Haris Silajdzic in 2006 -- usually succeed in 
<br>elections. Radoncic also cultivates wide international ties, 
<br>and Sead Numanovic, editor-in-chief of Avaz, is one of the 
<br>most well-connected people in Bosnia. 
<br>
<br>The Scandals 
<br>------------ 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) Radoncic is widely believed to be responsible for 
<br>corrupt business practices, most notably his role in a 
<br>scandal involving the Federation Development Bank (FDB) (ref 
<br>A). Radoncic admitted to having hired Ramiz Dzaferovic -- 
<br>SDA member, director of the FDB -- to conduct an audit of 
<br>Avaz through Dzaferovic's personal audit company. At the 
<br>same time, Dzaferovic through the FDB gave Radoncic a loan of 
<br>KM 22.5 million -- which the FDB had allocated for 
<br>agriculture -- for the construction of Radoncic's Avaz Tower 
<br>in Sarajevo. Separately, local media recently reported 
<br>alleged ties between Radoncic and international drug dealer 
<br>Kelmendi, which led Radoncic to launch a full-scale attack in 
<br>the pages of Avaz against the police officials working on 
<br>that case. Also, staff of the Office of the High 
<br>Representative (OHR) recently linked Radoncic to an 
<br>international money laundering scheme. This allegation, 
<br>which was leaked to the press, sparked a smear campaign in 
<br>Avaz against the Principal Deputy High Representative, a 
<br>State Department employee on detail to OHR, somewhat belying 
<br>Radoncic's claims that one of his priorities will be to 
<br>
<br>SARAJEVO 00000134 002 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>cooperate with the international community. 
<br>
<br>The Entree into Politics 
<br>------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) In September 2009, Radoncic launched a new Bosniak 
<br>political party, the Alliance for a Better Future of BiH 
<br>(SBB-BiH) (ref B). Radoncic is almost certainly seeking 
<br>political status in order to secure protection from the 
<br>investigation of his illegal business deals by wielding 
<br>government influence over the judiciary. Moreover, now may 
<br>be a personally appealing time for Radoncic to enter 
<br>politics, as media outlets besides Avaz indicate that 
<br>Radoncic's business is struggling and that Avaz's chief rival 
<br>daily newspaper, Oslobodjenje, is rapidly catching up to Avaz 
<br>in its sales. This suggests that the pragmatic Radoncic is 
<br>entering the political scene to seek lucrative deals wherever 
<br>he can find them, rather than choosing partners based on 
<br>ideology or even ethnic affiliation. This approach would 
<br>make him an appealing ally for Republika Srpska (RS) Prime 
<br>Minister Milorad Dodik, who also dabbles in business and is 
<br>himself under investigation for corruption. Dodik therefore 
<br>may see Radoncic as his ideal Bosniak interlocutor. Indeed, 
<br>Radoncic told the DCM in January that he has met with Dodik, 
<br>as well as Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ)-BiH President 
<br>Dragan Covic -- who has been indicted for corruption and is 
<br>forging a closer relationship with Dodik (septel) -- and has 
<br>a good relationship with both men. Moreover, the fact that 
<br>Avaz has kept mostly quiet on the very issue that it could 
<br>use to galvanize the Bosniak populace ahead of the election 
<br>-- rhetoric on a referendum in the RS -- has led to 
<br>speculation that discussions on a partnership between Dodik 
<br>and Radoncic may already be underway. 
<br>
<br>The Setbacks 
<br>------------ 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) Despite any possible musings of a deal with Dodik, 
<br>SBB-BiH appears to be off to a rocky start. Initial polls 
<br>suggest that the party has a small following, and Radoncic 
<br>has yet to attract any well-known personalities to join his 
<br>party. His most notable party member besides himself is 
<br>former state-level PM and former SDA member Adnan Terzic, 
<br>although Terzic's following within SDA was tenuous at best 
<br>when he left the party. The other big name in SBB-BiH is 
<br>Haris Basic, a former SDA member whom the Council of 
<br>Ministers suspended as director of the Foreign Investment 
<br>Promotion Agency (FIPA) due to the BiH Court's indictment 
<br>against him for illegally issuing transport licenses. 
<br>Radoncic also has not yet managed to form a founding party 
<br>congress despite the high attendance at his kickoff rallies 
<br>in Sarajevo, Tuzla, Zenica, and elsewhere. Also, Radoncic -- 
<br>whose family is rom the Sandzak region in Serbia -- carries 
<br>a stong "Sandzak" accent when he speaks, which is anathma 
<br>to many Bosnians. Moreover, he lacks persona charisma and 
<br>is generally uncomfortable and awkard with interlocutors who 
<br>are unfamiliar to him. 
<br>
<br>The Weapons 
<br>----------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) Despite these initial setbacks, Radoncic's 
<br>expectations for electoral success are high. Through public 
<br>hearings conducted by the BiH parliamentary working group on 
<br>changes to the election law, Radoncic in January proposed an 
<br>increase in the threshold for a party's representation in 
<br>Parliament from three to five percent at the state and entity 
<br>level. The parliamentary working group on changes to the 
<br>election law rejected his proposal. Radoncic's most powerful 
<br>weapon during the elections will be Avaz, and he already is 
<br>using it as an advertising venue for his party. The economy, 
<br>a major concern for Bosniak voters, is one of Avaz's key 
<br>pre-election themes, as well as the incompetence of BiH's 
<br>current leadership, particularly Bosniak tri-Presidency 
<br>member Haris Silajdzic. Amid the country-wide economic 
<br>crisis, these messages may well resonate with apathetic 
<br>Bosniak voters. Indeed, Terzic told the DCM that this is one 
<br>of SBB-BiH's key target groups in the election campaign. 
<br>
<br>The SBiH Political Vacuum 
<br>------------------------- 
<br>
<br>SARAJEVO 00000134 003 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Radoncic's entree into the Bosniak political scene 
<br>will most likely come at the expense of the deteriorating 
<br>SBiH. SBiH garnered poor results in the 2008 municipal 
<br>elections, and our SBiH contacts continue to tell us of the 
<br>disgruntlement within the party with Silajdzic's poor 
<br>leadership. Bakir Izetbegovic, who is a friend of Silajdzic, 
<br>has suggested to us that Silajdzic may in fact be preparing 
<br>to leave the political scene. Moreover, the Islamic 
<br>community, which had previously endorsed Silajdzic, now 
<br>supports Radoncic at the expense of SBiH. Avaz consistently 
<br>maligns Silajdzic, calling him a "lying President" and a 
<br>"mafia godfather" who steals from the poor. Radoncic also is 
<br>seeking to fill Silajdzic's self-proclaimed role as the key 
<br>Bosniak interlocutor with the USG. For example, his visit to 
<br>Washington in February to attend the prayer breakfast, as 
<br>well as his speech at the U.S. Institute of Peace, received 
<br>widespread press throughout BiH, dwarfing that of the other 
<br>BiH attendees. 
<br>
<br>The Boost from the Islamic Community 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶8. (S/NF) Silajdzic's victory in the 2006 presidential race 
<br>stemmed from the same sources Radoncic has at his disposal -- 
<br>Dnevni Avaz and Islamic community head Reis-ul-ulema Mustafa 
<br>Ceric, whom Avaz quoted almost daily in the run-up to the 
<br>2006 elections and who was seen with Silajdzic at a number of 
<br>important Islamic events (ref C). Although Radoncic is not 
<br>at all devout, he and Reis Ceric have enjoyed a close 
<br>relationship for over a year, most likely tied to Radoncic's 
<br>gift of one million KM (approximately 714,000 USD) for the 
<br>construction of the Reis's headquarters and residence in 
<br>Sarajevo. Additionally, Reis Ceric is the only public figure 
<br>whom Avaz has never criticized. Avaz regularly features the 
<br>Reis on the front page, reports on his travels, and mocks 
<br>media outlets that criticize him. Avaz even posited a 
<br>"different interpretation" of the conviction in February 2009 
<br>of an imam in Travnik on charges of pedophilia (ref D). 
<br>Radoncic openly echoes the Reis's outcry against 
<br>"Islamophobia" (ref E), most recently attacking former 
<br>editor-in-chief of Federation TV (FTV) Duska Jurisic, who 
<br>reported on Radoncic's role in the FDB scandal. Radoncic 
<br>stated that "we cannot permit a person who is not Muslim to 
<br>be an editor in our Islamic community." Any overt 
<br>endorsements by Reis Ceric of Radoncic's party would give 
<br>Radoncic a boost among religious voters who see Tihic as 
<br>overly secular; conversely, Radoncic can revel in his 
<br>irreverent understanding of Islam if he so chooses. SDA 
<br>Deputy President Asim Sarajlic told us that he overheard the 
<br>Reis tell Radoncic at a reception, "People need to see you at 
<br>mosque," to which Radoncic allegedly replied, "But Reis, I 
<br>don't know any prayers!" Later, in a theatrical aside during 
<br>a lunch with DCM, Radoncic held his wine glass aloft and said 
<br>"I can't support radical Islam: I would be their first 
<br>victim!" 
<br>
<br>The Hurdle: SDA 
<br>--------------- 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Although it is too early to make concrete 
<br>predictions, at this point it seems that even with the 
<br>support of the Islamic community, Radoncic will be unlikely 
<br>to make great gains in these elections at the expense of SDA. 
<br>SDA has a well-established voting base, particularly in 
<br>rural and semi-urban areas. Bosniaks considered SDA and its 
<br>first President, Alija Izetbegovic, the protectors of their 
<br>people during the war, and the limited success of splinter 
<br>parties like SBiH in recent elections suggests that Bosniaks 
<br>choose established parties over charismatic new leaders when 
<br>they feel threatened (ref F). Even with SBiH's 
<br>Tri-Presidency victory in 2006, SDA remained the largest 
<br>Bosniak party, capturing more seats in both Federation and 
<br>state legislatures than SBiH. Moreover, although Radoncic 
<br>wields significant media power, he relies on SDA for 
<br>financial support, due to SDA's connections with the FDB. 
<br>Avaz treats Tihic with caution -- including by sidelining 
<br>Tihic's repeated, direct attacks on Radoncic -- suggesting 
<br>that Radoncic recognizes the risk in burning bridges with the 
<br>most powerful Bosniak party. 
<br>
<br>
<br>SARAJEVO 00000134 004 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>The Impact: Fractious Bosniak Politics 
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶10. (S/NF) Although Radoncic treads carefully with SDA, he 
<br>bears a longstanding animosity with the other major 
<br>Federation-based party, the Social Democratic Party (SDP), 
<br>stemming largely from his personal dislike of party President 
<br>Zlatko Lagumdzija. However, Radoncic -- genuinely shocking 
<br>Avaz editor Numanovic, who was also present -- told the DCM 
<br>in January that he had recently met with Lagumdzija for over 
<br>two hours to discuss a possible post-election coalition, 
<br>which he may see as a means of sidelining SDA. Nonetheless, 
<br>Avaz's consistent disparaging of Lagumdzija and Silajdzic -- 
<br>as well as Radoncic's ties to the Reis, who also is on the 
<br>outs with both men -- makes it less likely that either party 
<br>will want to work with Radoncic before or after the 
<br>elections. These inflammatory comments are likely to 
<br>increase as the year progresses, which will contribute to a 
<br>Bosniak campaign that may well be based more on personal 
<br>attacks than on any potentially unifying issue. A strong 
<br>showing for Radoncic in the elections would put him in a 
<br>position to negotiate a place in a post-election coalition. 
<br>Even if Radoncic serves in opposition, he will become one 
<br>more strong personality in Bosniak politics that could 
<br>undermine initiatives from moderate Bosniak parties. 
<br>Moreover, Radoncic is powerful, due to his business ties and 
<br>the strong influence of Avaz. He may be able to seriously 
<br>damage any party inside or outside the coalition that 
<br>challenges him. As the economic crisis shows no signs of 
<br>abating, Radoncic could become a greater force, given the 
<br>hide-bound lethargy and backward-looking politics of many of 
<br>his Bosniak opponents. 
<br>
<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶11. (S/NF) The collapse of the Prud process (ref G), the 
<br>political and economic woes in the Federation (ref H), and 
<br>the battle over the mayor of Mostar (ref I) are recent 
<br>examples of the extent to which fractious Bosniak politics 
<br>contribute to paralysis at the state and Federation level. 
<br>Tihic's attempts to shore up the state have been held in 
<br>check by opposition on his right flank -- Silajdzic, the 
<br>Islamic community, and even Lagumdzija, who sees it as his 
<br>duty as opposition leader to oppose any initiative the ruling 
<br>coalition supports. If Radoncic succeeds in establishing a 
<br>foothold in a new government, Tihic will face a more 
<br>difficult battle in securing a unified Bosniak response to 
<br>anti-state behavior from the RS and in taking a constructive 
<br>approach to such initiatives as constitutional reform. 
<br>Moreover, an alliance between Radoncic and Dodik, perceived 
<br>as two of the country's more corrupt leaders, would send a 
<br>very discouraging message to those in Bosnia and Herzegovina 
<br>who are seeking the rule of law, especially the Bosniak 
<br>intellectual elite. 
<br>
<br>Comment Cont'd 
<br>-------------- 
<br>
<br>¶12. (S/NF) At the same time -- however distasteful it may be 
<br>to us or others -- if Radoncic and gains enough authority 
<br>through the October 2010 elections to join a ruling coalition 
<br>at the state or Federation level, his comparative lack of 
<br>discord with RS leaders and pragmatic approach on issues 
<br>ranging from economic development to constitutional reform 
<br>and Euro-Atlantic integration could perhaps contribute to a 
<br>more peaceful political situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina 
<br>over the near term.
