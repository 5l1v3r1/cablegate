<br>CLASSIFIED BY: Timothy Richardson, Acting Director, Iran 
<br>Regional Presence Office, Department of State. 
<br>REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 
<br>¶1. (U) This is a joint cable by the Iran Regional Presence 
<br>Office and the Dubai Regional Media Hub. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S/NF) Summary: Since Iran's June 12 presidential elections, 
<br>Arab media have intensely focused their coverage on the 
<br>demonstrations in Iran and the international community's 
<br>response to the government crackdown.  Whereas in recent years 
<br>the Arab media have limited their commentary to Iran's external 
<br>relations -- particularly its regional ambitions and the 
<br>international implications of its nuclear program -- during the 
<br>post-election crisis Arab commentators have, for the first time, 
<br>poked a hole in the veneer of the Islamic Republic's internal 
<br>political system and explored its underpinnings more closely, 
<br>often challenging the system's very legitimacy in on-air 
<br>commentary.  A number of these commentators have opined that 
<br>Ahmadinejad has, at least in the near term, lost standing among 
<br>some moderate Arabs, who have come to view Ahmadinejad's 
<br>administration as oppressive, unpopular, and undemocratic, much 
<br>as they criticize many Arab governments.  However, all of the 
<br>Arab media figures we spoke to emphasized that Arab criticism of 
<br>Ahmadinejad has not necessarily led to increased support for 
<br>U.S. policy in the region.  On the contrary, closer analysis 
<br>suggests that Ahmadinejad's eroding popularity in the Arab world 
<br>has created a scenario in which any U.S. effort to engage the 
<br>current Iranian government will be perceived by a wide spectrum 
<br>of Arabs as accommodation with Ahmadinejad. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>ALL EYES ON IRAN 
<br> 
<br>---------------- 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S/NF) Iran's post-election crisis has dominated the Arab 
<br>media's news coverage for the past seven weeks.  The 
<br>demonstrations have garnered special coverage on Al-Arabiya and 
<br>have consistently been among the top headlines on Al-Jazeera. 
<br>The marketing director of the Middle East Broadcasting Company 
<br>(MBC), parent company of Al-Arabiya, told IRPO/DRMH that 
<br>Al-Arabiya's viewership has skyrocketed since the June 12 
<br>election.  Al-Arabiya's news website has also experienced a 
<br>dramatic increase in visits from users living in the region 
<br>between Tripoli and Amman, which the marketing director, a 
<br>native of Lebanon, attributed to the tremendous interest Sunni 
<br>Arabs have in watching the drama in Iran unfold.  Coverage of 
<br>Iran's election aftermath is not limited to straightforward news 
<br>reporting; editorial pages, media commentaries, and the Arab 
<br>blogosphere have also been abuzz with debate over the 
<br>demonstrations, the international community's response, and the 
<br>implications of these events for the Arab world.  While Iran's 
<br>elections may no longer command daily headlines in the Western 
<br>media, nearly all the Arab media commentators with whom we spoke 
<br>recognized that the Arab street remains firmly focused on the 
<br>recent unrest and continuing political drama playing out in Iran. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>THE BENEVOLENT DICTATOR'S FALL FROM GRACE? 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (S/NF) A Syrian journalist and blogger, who owns a media 
<br>consultancy firm in Dubai, believes that many in the Arab street 
<br>initially viewed Ahmadinejad when he came to power in 2005 as a 
<br>"benevolent dictator."  Citing the tradition of the Mahdi, the 
<br>media consultant argued that both Shi'a and Sunni Arabs are 
<br>taught from early childhood to await the arrival of a strong and 
<br>unimpeachable figure who will lead the Muslim world.  The media 
<br>consultant maintained that even secular Arabs view the world, 
<br>albeit unintentionally, with this ingrained mindset.  Our 
<br>contact argued that Ahmadinejad played in to this narrative, and 
<br>when Ahmadinejad arrived on the international stage many Arabs 
<br>saw him, in contrast to their own flawed leaders, as a humble 
<br>and pious man who was brave enough to stand up for his people 
<br>and the greater Muslim world by confronting Israel and the West 
<br>head on.  However,  both the intensely competitive campaign 
<br>period and the forceful reaction by the Iranian people to the 
<br>official election results have led some moderate Arabs to 
<br>rethink Ahmadinejad's  true disposition. The election, the media 
<br>consultant said, led some Arabs to understand that despite his 
<br>astutely crafted and well-marketed image in the Arab world, 
<br> 
<br>DUBAI 00000316  002.2 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Ahmadinejad is resented by many Iranians for domestic 
<br>mismanagement, incompetence, and corruption.  Because of this 
<br>public fall from grace, so the media consultant told us, 
<br>Ahmadinejad is no longer the "untouchable, holy figure" in the 
<br>Arab world he once was -- his flaws have brought him down to the 
<br>level of the Arab world's own imperfect leaders. An Al-Arabiya 
<br>executive, speaking at a recent conference, said that the 
<br>election aftermath had destroyed the image many Arabs had of the 
<br>Islamic Revolution, and Ahmadinejad's legitimacy as a leader was 
<br>now open to question. [NOTE: The media consultant attributed 
<br>Iran's perceived "victories" over the U.S. and the West to 
<br>Ahmadinejad, as opposed to Supreme Leader Khamenei.  While 
<br>conventional wisdom in the West is that Khamenei has the final 
<br>say over Iran's most vital interests, including the nuclear 
<br>program, the consultant's comments suggest that the Arab street 
<br>views Ahmadinejad as much more influential in the Islamic 
<br>Republic's decision-making system.] 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>POST-ELECTION CRISIS NOT A SILVER BULLET FOR ARAB REGIMES 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (S/NF) Ahmadinejad's fall from grace notwithstanding, most of 
<br>the Arab media commentators with whom we spoke agreed that Arab 
<br>governments have a limited ability to capitalize on 
<br>Ahmadinejad's missteps because of the skeletons in their own 
<br>closets.   Al-Arabiya's former Tehran bureau chief observed that 
<br>Arab regional powers like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, who no doubt 
<br>would like to exploit Ahmadinejad's current vulnerabilities, 
<br>have remained noticeably silent.  In his view, they realize that 
<br>any statement condemning Tehran's crackdown on peaceful 
<br>dissidents would appear untenably hypocritical in the eyes of 
<br>their own citizens.  He considers this public silence yet 
<br>another "missed opportunity" for Arab leaders to take a stand to 
<br>counter Ahmadinejad's rhetoric and further detract from his 
<br>popularity with the Arab street. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>NEW SPACE TO DISAGREE WITH AHMADINEJAD AND THE U.S. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (S/NF)  All of the Arab commentators and news media figures 
<br>we spoke to agreed that the U.S. "played it right" throughout 
<br>the post-election crisis by staying away from detailed public 
<br>comments that could be perceived as interventionist.  However, 
<br>the Arab commentators were quick to distinguish between 
<br>criticism of Ahmadinejad in the Arab street and support for U.S. 
<br>policies.  The Syrian media consultant said that the heated 
<br>debates before the election, in which the three challengers -- 
<br>Mousavi, Karroubi, and Reza'i -- publicly criticized Ahmadinejad 
<br>for corruption and economic mismanagement, made it clear to 
<br>Arabs that this election was about Iran, not the U.S.  This 
<br>distinction, coupled with the U.S.' restraint in commenting on 
<br>the election, provided an unprecedented window for Arab 
<br>commentators to criticize Ahmadinejad without appearing to side 
<br>with the U.S. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (S/NF) Examples of this played out during two separate 
<br>appearances by the Dubai Regional Media Hub Acting Director on 
<br>live panel discussions on Abu Dhabi TV and Lebanese New TV 
<br>regarding regional issues, including events in Iran.  Whereas 
<br>fellow Arab panelist resolutely disagreed with her comments in 
<br>support of U.S. policy in the region, in particular the peace 
<br>process, they felt free to openly criticize Ahmadinejad's 
<br>government, which they refrained from doing in the past, for its 
<br>internal crackdown and regional ambitions.  One Saudi 
<br>commentator contrasted Turkish regional mediation, which he 
<br>described as a positive force in the region, with Iranian 
<br>regional intervention, which he called pernicious and 
<br>destabilizing.  A Lebanese commentator noted the irony of Iran 
<br>accusing outsiders of interfering in its internal affairs when 
<br>there is not "one corner of the Arab world" where Iran does not 
<br>intervene behind the scenes. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>AHMADINEJAD DOWN BUT NOT OUT 
<br> 
<br>DUBAI 00000316  003.2 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (S/NF) As Al-Arabiya's Tehran bureau chief noted, while 
<br>Ahmadinejad's image may have taken a hit in the Arab street as a 
<br>result of the government's handling of domestic dissent, the 
<br>damage is not necessarily permanent.  In his view, the Arab 
<br>street is notoriously emotional and "could easily be turned to 
<br>support Ahmadinejad once again" with some trumped up slogans and 
<br>public bravado.  The bureau chief believed that, in the 
<br>perceived leadership void left by Arab leaders on regional 
<br>issues, Ahmadinejad could rally public opinion by capitalizing 
<br>on any number of sensitive issues for the Arab street, most 
<br>prominent among them Israel, at upcoming international fora. 
<br>The Syrian media consultant, too, cautioned the U.S. not to 
<br>overestimate any erosion in Ahmadinejad's popularity with Arabs. 
<br> In his opinion, Ahmadinejad has only lost standing with a 
<br>segment of moderates in the Arab street; he believes that most 
<br>Arabs are so polarized, either for or against Ahmadinejad, that 
<br>the allegations of voter fraud and the violent post-election 
<br>crackdown on protesters will not permanently sway their 
<br>positions one way or the other. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>ENGAGEMENT WITH IRAN: NO PLEASING THE ARAB STREET 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (S/NF) Comment:  Once the dust settles on Iran's 
<br>post-election crisis, Arabs will look to see if the U.S. deals 
<br>with Ahmadinejad as it pursues its nuclear nonproliferation 
<br>agenda despite the lingering questions over the legitimacy of 
<br>his election.  If the U.S. enters negotiations with 
<br>Ahmadinejad's government, moderate Arab observers may argue that 
<br>the U.S., for the sake of its own national interest, has cut a 
<br>deal at the expense of pro-democracy advocates -- just as many 
<br>in the Arab street believe the U.S. has done with a number of 
<br>Arab regimes.  Those Arabs who continue to support Ahmadinejad, 
<br>on the other hand, may perceive negotiations as a personal 
<br>victory for a humble leader who brought the U.S. to its knees 
<br>through steadfast resistance.  Thus, Ahmadinejad's "fall from 
<br>grace" in the Arab world may have created yet another obstacle 
<br>to improved Arab perceptions of the U.S. -- in which engagement 
<br>with an Ahmadinejad-led government is now a potentially 
<br>lose-lose scenario in which Arabs at both ends of the pro- and 
<br>anti-Ahmadinejad spectrum will consider negotiations with 
<br>Teheran an accommodation with the Iranian president.
