<br>OF MONEY FOR CLOSING MANAS

<br>REF: A. BISHKEK 96 
<br>¶B. BISHKEK 85 
<br> 
<br>BISHKEK 00000135  001.2 OF 002 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Tatiana C. Gfoeller, Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) Summary:  During a meeting with the Ambassador 
<br>February 13, Chinese Ambassador Zhang Yannian ridiculed the 
<br>idea, but did not deny categorically, that China would 
<br>provide Kyrgyzstan a $3 billion financial package in return 
<br>for closing Manas Air Base.  Zhang said Kyrgyzstan was in 
<br>Russia's sphere of influence, and China had only commercial 
<br>interests here.  He also complained bitterly about Chinese 
<br>Guantanamo detainees being shipped to Germany instead of 
<br>China.  Zhang was very interested in whether the U.S. would 
<br>negotiate to keep Manas, and he advised just giving the 
<br>Kyrgyz $150 million a year for the Base.  "This is all about 
<br>money," he said.  End Summary. 
<br> 
<br>LOSING THE ABILITY TO SPEAK RUSSIAN 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) Ambassador met February 13 with Chinese Ambassador to 
<br>Kyrgyzstan Zhang Yannian.  After opening pleasantries, the 
<br>Ambassador mentioned that Kyrgyz officials had told her  that 
<br>China had offered a $3 billion financial package to close 
<br>Manas Air Base and asked for the Ambassador's reaction to 
<br>such an allegation.  Visibly flustered, Zhang temporarily 
<br>lost the ability to speak Russian and began spluttering in 
<br>Chinese to the silent aide diligently taking notes right 
<br>behind him.  Once he had recovered the power of Russian 
<br>speech, he inveighed against such a calumny, claiming that 
<br>such an idea was impossible, China was a staunch opponent of 
<br>terrorism, and China's attitude toward Kyrgyzstan's decision 
<br>to close Manas was one of "respect and understanding." 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) Composing himself, Zhang inquired if maybe the Kyrgyz 
<br>had meant the trade turnover between the two countries, which 
<br>he claimed was about $3 billion a year.  When disabused of 
<br>that notion, Zhang went on at length to explain that China 
<br>could not afford a $3 billion loan and aid package.  "It 
<br>would take $3 from every Chinese person" to pay for it.  "If 
<br>our people found out, there'd be a revolution," he said.  "We 
<br>have 200 million people unemployed" because of the downturn 
<br>in exports, he said, and millions of disabled and others who 
<br>need help from the government. 
<br> 
<br>A SLAP IN THE FACE 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) When the Ambassador asked whether he would 
<br>categorically deny what the Kyrgyz officials had told her 
<br>about a deal with China, Zhang snapped that "releasing 17 
<br>from Guantanamo is an unfriendly act toward us."  He then 
<br>went on at length about what a "slap in the face" it was to 
<br>China that the Uighur detainees were not going to be returned 
<br>to their homeland but instead shipped to Germany, where 
<br>reportedly they had already been granted refugee status. 
<br>While not stating a tit-for-tat reaction on Manas, he did 
<br>imply that the Guantanamo situation had made China look for 
<br>ways to hit back at the U.S.  When the Ambassador inquired if 
<br>maybe the Chinese were favorably disposed toward closing 
<br>Manas because of their SCO membership, Zhang acknowledged 
<br>that the SCO had pronounced for closing Manas, but claimed 
<br>that "that was years ago and nothing has happened since."  He 
<br>denied that the SCO was pressuring the Kyrgyz to close Manas. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>RUSSIA: A GIFT FROM GOD FOR THE KYRGYZ 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) The Ambassador then asked what Zhang thought about the 
<br>$2 billion plus Russian deal with Kyrgyzstan.  After some 
<br>hemming and hawing, Zhang said it was "probably true" that 
<br> 
<br>BISHKEK 00000135  002.2 OF 002 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>the Russian assistance was tied to closing Manas.  Asked if 
<br>he had any concerns about the Kyrgyz Republic falling ever 
<br>deeper into the Russian sphere of influence and whether China 
<br>had any interest in countering this, he answered that 
<br>Kyrgyzstan was already in that sphere, and China had no 
<br>interest in balancing that influence.  "Kyrgyzstan is 
<br>Russia's neighbor," he intoned (somewhat expansively, since 
<br>Kyrgyzstan does not share a border with the Russian 
<br>Federation -- though it does share a border with China). 
<br>"And when the Kyrgyz ask me about this, I always tell them 
<br>that a neighbor is a gift from God."  As for China's 
<br>interests in the Kyrgyz Republic, he stated flatly:  "We have 
<br>only commercial interests here.  We want to increase 
<br>investment and trade.  We have no interest in politics."  He 
<br>claimed that some Kyrgyz had argued for China to open a base 
<br>in Kyrgyzstan to counterbalance Russian and American 
<br>influence in the country, but China has no interest in a 
<br>base.  "We want no military or political advantage. 
<br>Therefore, we wouldn't pay $3 billion for Manas," he argued. 
<br> 
<br>PERSONAL ADVICE: PAY THEM $150 MILLION 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) Zhang asked the Ambassador whether the U.S. would 
<br>negotiate to keep the Base open.  The Ambassador answered 
<br>that the U.S. side was evaluating its options.  Zhang then 
<br>offered his "personal advice,"  "This is all about money," he 
<br>said.  He understood from the Kyrgyz that they needed $150 
<br>million.  The Ambassador explained that the U.S. does provide 
<br>$150 million in assistance to Kyrgyzstan each year, including 
<br>numerous assistance programs.  Zhang suggested that the U.S. 
<br>should scrap its assistance programs.  "Just give them $150 
<br>million in cash" per year, and "you will have the Base 
<br>forever."  Very uncharacteristically, the silent young aide 
<br>then jumped in: "Or maybe you should give them $5 billion and 
<br>buy both us and the Russians out."  The aide then withered 
<br>under the Ambassador's horrified stare. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) Commenting on the recent diplomatic corps lunch (Ref 
<br>B), Zhang noted that Russian Ambassador Vlasov had been in an 
<br>expansive mood and dominated portions of the meeting.  "I 
<br>think that's when he found out that they'd reached a deal" 
<br>with Bakiyev to close the Base, he opined.  Zhang, who is 
<br>doyen of the diplomatic corps, said he would be leaving 
<br>Bishkek soon, but did not yet know his next assignment.  "In 
<br>our service," he said, "we don't know our postings until the 
<br>last minute." 
<br> 
<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (C) Zhang was clearly flustered when confronted with the 
<br>claims of Kyrgyz officials that they were negotiating a 
<br>financial deal with China in return for closing the Base. 
<br>While he ridiculed the notion of such a deal, he did not deny 
<br>it outright.  Perhaps because of his being discomposed, he 
<br>returned several times to the topic of a possible revolution 
<br>in China if the economic picture does not improve and work is 
<br>not found for the millions of unemployed there.  In our 
<br>experience, talk of revolution at home is taboo for Chinese 
<br>diplomats.  While candid at times, the meeting ended on a 
<br>very cordial note.
