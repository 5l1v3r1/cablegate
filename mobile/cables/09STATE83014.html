<br>
<br>REF: A. BOGOTA 2409 B. STATE 81957: REPORT OF U.S.-
<br>RUSSIA MANPADS EXPERTS MEETING
<br>
<br>Classified By: EUR/PRA ACTING DIRECTOR KATHELEEN
<br>MORENSKI FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D).
<br>
<br>¶1. (U) This is an action request. Embassies Madrid and
<br>Stockholm see para 6.
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) Summary: In an August 3 telcon with the
<br>Secretary, Colombian President Uribe expressed concerns over
<br>evidence that three Swedish-origin anti-tank missiles sold to
<br>Venezuela were found in the possession of the Revolutionary
<br>Armed Force of Colombia (FARC). The Swedish Embassy in
<br>Bogota (Ref A) confirmed that the weapons were manufactured
<br>by Sweden and sold to the Government of Venezuela (GOV) in
<br>¶1988. This incident has been widely reported in the press,
<br>and underscores growing ties between the GOV and the FARC.
<br>The matter is of concern to the Government of Colombia (GOC)
<br>and to us because the weapons were diverted from Venezuelan
<br>military stocks and because of other separate, compelling
<br>evidence of the GOV's support for the FARC. The GOC has
<br>taken an aggressive, fact-based approach in addressing the
<br>GOV's support for the FARC, and has requested USG help in
<br>urging all nations that have completed or are contemplating
<br>arms sales to Venezuela to take GOV support for the FARC into
<br>account, including reconsidering such sales. As current and
<br>upcoming EU Presidents respectively, Sweden and Spain are
<br>well positioned to raise awareness of this incident and to
<br>urge other EU members, as well as Russia, to strengthen
<br>transparency and accountability in arms exports to Venezuela.
<br>End Summary.
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) Background: According to Ref A, the GOC has
<br>seized three M-136 AT4 anti-tank missiles from the batch
<br>Sweden sold to Venezuela. The Swedish confirmed that these
<br>weapons were manufactured by Saab Bofors Dynamics of Sweden
<br>and sold to Venezuela in 1988. Since media reports about
<br>this incident broke out in July, the Swedish government has
<br>been actively working with Colombia to investigate how the
<br>diversion occurred. The Swedish Ambassador in Bogota failed
<br>to get a response from the Venezuelan Defense and Foreign
<br>Ministries to investigate how the Swedish-origin weapons
<br>ended up in the hands of FARC guerillas. On July 29,
<br>Colombian President Uribe issued a statement highlighting
<br>that Sweden had asked Venezuela to investigate, but the GOV
<br>had not yet responded. After initially claiming that the
<br>story was a Colombian fabrication, on August 5 Venezuelan
<br>President Chavez claimed that the missiles were stolen from a
<br>Venezuelan naval base fourteen years ago; he said Sweden had
<br>"fallen into (Colombian
<br>government's) play" and asserted his government would not be
<br>providing Sweden any further explanation.
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) Background continued: As highlighted in Uribe's
<br>July 29 statement, the Colombian government is also concerned
<br>about FARC interest in acquiring man-portable air defense
<br>systems (MANPADS). Given that Russia has begun delivery of
<br>sophisticated Igla-S MANPADS to Venezuela, over the last
<br>several months we have engaged at high levels with Russia to
<br>express our concerns over the possibility of the FARC
<br>acquiring them. In early March, Secretary Clinton raised the
<br>sale with Russian FM Sergey Lavrov, who promised that
<br>"surprise inspections" were in place to prevent unauthorized
<br>re-transfer of these systems. During a U.S.-Russian experts
<br>meeting on MANPADS held in Washington July 9-10 (Ref B), the
<br>Russian side promised a written response to our request for
<br>clarification of Lavrov's remark. We have also raised with
<br>Russia evidence of Russian-produced assault rifle ammunition
<br>sold to Venezuela and found in FARC caches, and have sought
<br>an investigation. WHA A/S Shannon presented this evidence,
<br>including
<br>photographs, to Russian Ambassador Kislyak May 28 and
<br>requested that Russia look into the matter. On August 6, WHA
<br>PDAS Kelly raised the issue again with Russian DCM Darchiyev,
<br>seeking an update on the Russian inquiry; Darchiyev said that
<br>the Russian government continued to investigate and would
<br>provide an update shortly.
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) The recovered Russian-origin ammunition in
<br>Colombia, the ongoing Russian sale of advanced Igla-S MANPADS
<br>to Venezuela, and the latest Swedish incident have all
<br>reinforced growing concerns about the risk of increasing
<br>proliferation of arms to terrorist and criminal organizations
<br>in the region. Part of our strategy to counter this, and to
<br>respond to the GOC request, is to engage directly with
<br>countries which have or potentially could export arms to
<br>Venezuela. Russia is the predominant arms supplier to
<br>Venezuela, totaling over $5 billion last year and growing.
<br>However, the latest Swedish incident underscores that older
<br>systems, including those supplied in the past by EU
<br>countries, can end up in the wrong hands, particularly as
<br>they are displaced in Venezuelan inventories by newer weapons
<br>acquired. To this end, the USG seeks to encourage Sweden and
<br>Spain, in their capacity as the current and upcoming EU
<br>Presidents respectively, to raise awareness of
<br>Venezuelan-FARC ties, to strengthen accountability and t
<br>ransparency within the EU over arms sales to Venezuela given
<br>these recent reports of diversions, and to take action in
<br>multilateral export control regimes. As appropriate, we will
<br>seek to keep the GOC apprised of our efforts. End background.
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) Embassies Stockholm and Madrid are requested to
<br>convey at the highest appropriate level the following talking
<br>points. Embassies are also requested to encourage host
<br>governments to share their views on these points with the
<br>Government of Colombia:
<br>
<br>Talking Points for Embassy Stockholm:
<br>
<br>--We appreciate your efforts to work with Colombia and to
<br>press Venezuela for an explanation on how three M-136 AT4
<br>anti-tank missiles Sweden sold to Venezuela in 1988 ended up
<br>in FARC stocks.
<br>
<br>--Diversion of conventional weapons, including MANPADS, to
<br>terrorist and criminal organizations, such as the FARC,
<br>presents a clear threat to peace and security in Latin
<br>America.
<br>
<br>--We prefer that EU members not transfer arms to Venezuela.
<br>If arms are transferred to Venezuela, we ask that EU Member
<br>States work to strengthen transparency and accountability
<br>measures for such exports, such as through post-shipment
<br>verification to ensure that the arms remain in Venezuelan
<br>hands.
<br>
<br>-- We are aware of and appreciate EU efforts to strengthen
<br>transparency and accountability via its Code of Conduct.
<br>
<br>--We encourage Sweden, in its capacity as EU President, to
<br>raise further awareness of this matter within the EU and
<br>through multilateral export-control mechanisms.
<br>
<br>--To that end, we urge Sweden to present a paper on the
<br>illegal transfer of Swedish arms from Venezuelan stocks, as
<br>well as Sweden's view of arms transfers to Venezuela, at the
<br>Wassenaar General Working Group in October.
<br>
<br>-- We would also urge you to raise these transfers with the
<br>Russian government. The United States has raised concerns
<br>with Russia about arms transfers to Venezuela. Sharing your
<br>experiences with the Russian government may encourage them to
<br>ensure that their weapons are not diverted.
<br>
<br>If asked about U.S. arms sales to Venezuela:
<br>
<br>--As you may be aware, U.S. persons are barred by statute
<br>from transferring arms to Venezuela, a consequence of a 2006
<br>determination that Venezuela was "not fully cooperating" on
<br>counter-terrorism issues.
<br>
<br>
<br>Talking Points for Embassy Madrid:
<br>
<br>--Diversion of conventional weapons, including MANPADS, to
<br>terrorist and criminal organizations, such as the FARC,
<br>presents a clear threat to peace and security in Latin
<br>America.
<br>
<br>--We prefer that EU members not transfer arms to Venezuela.
<br>If arms are transferred to Venezuela, we ask that EU Member
<br>States work to strengthen transparency and accountability
<br>measures for such exports, such as through post-shipment
<br>verification to ensure that the arms remain in Venezuelan
<br>hands.
<br>
<br>-- We are aware of and appreciate EU efforts to strengthen
<br>transparency and accountability via its Code of Conduct.
<br>
<br>--We encourage Spain, in its capacity as EU President in
<br>2010, to raise further awareness of this matter within the EU
<br>and through multilateral export-control mechanisms.
<br>
<br>--We would also urge you to raise these transfers with the
<br>Russian government. The United States has raised concerns
<br>with Russia about arms transfers to Venezuela. Sharing your
<br>experiences with the Russian government may encourage them to
<br>ensure that their weapons are not diverted.
<br>
<br>If asked about U.S. arms sales to Venezuela:
<br>
<br>--As you may be aware, U.S. persons are barred by statute
<br>from transferring arms to Venezuela, a consequence of a 2006
<br>determination that Venezuela was "not fully cooperating" on
<br>counter-terrorism issues.
