<br>Classified By: Ambassador Michele J. Sison, reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br> 
<br> ¶1. (S) Summary. Embassy Abu Dhabi looks forward to welcoming 
<br>you to the UAE on May 7.  U.S. and UAE officials have had a 
<br>number of productive meetings on the topic of 
<br>counterterrorism, the most recent of which came on April 22, 
<br>when Fran Townsend, Assistant to the President for Homeland 
<br>Security and Counterterrorism, met over lunch with Abu Dhabi 
<br>Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed (MbZ) and his brother, 
<br>Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed (AbZ).  Your visit 
<br>builds on our ongoing dialogue and efforts to push the UAE on 
<br>several areas of interest to the USG: counterterrorism, 
<br>counter terror finance, Iran, Hamas, Iraq, and ideological 
<br>extremism (each is covered in the scenesetter).  We have 
<br>requested separate meetings with Foreign Minister Sheikh 
<br>Abdullah bin Zayed (AbZ), whom you met in New York last 
<br>September, and State Security Director Sheikh Hazza bin 
<br>Zayed, whom Deputy Coordinator Urbancic met last October.  In 
<br>your meetings, you should commend the UAE for its assistance 
<br>and cooperation, including its strong condemnation of the 
<br>April 24 bomb attack in Dahab.  The UAE remains a committed 
<br>partner in the global war on terror, but it continues to take 
<br>an ad hoc approach to countering terrorism that "solves" the 
<br>problem for the UAE locally, but fails to contribute on a 
<br>transnational basis.  In January, the U.S. and the UAE held 
<br>the first meeting of the Joint Terrorist Finance Coordinating 
<br>Committee (JTFCC).  Treasury U/S Levey is currently in the 
<br>UAE to hold a second meeting that will focus on cash couriers 
<br>and charities. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S) Although the UAE regards Iran as one of its most 
<br>serious threats to national security, UAE officials are 
<br>reluctant to take actions that could provoke their neighbor 
<br>and compromise their extensive trading relationship.  At the 
<br>same time, we are seeing more of a willingness on the part of 
<br>the UAE to support USG initiatives without the full approval 
<br>of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).  As tensions escalate 
<br>between Iran and the international community, the UAE is 
<br>growing increasingly nervous.  The UAE leadership, which has 
<br>told us they consider Hamas a terrorist organization, plans 
<br>to uphold its previous commitments of humanitarian assistance 
<br>to the Palestinian people.  The UAE has taken an active role 
<br>in encouraging Sunni participation in the Iraqi political 
<br>process and continues to condemn the sectarian violence that 
<br>is preventing stabilization of the country.  In the face of 
<br>growing ideological extremism in the Gulf, the UAE leadership 
<br>is politically determined not to allow Islamist extremists to 
<br>gain a foothold on UAE soil.  End Summary. 
<br> 
<br>Counterterrorism Efforts 
<br>------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S) The UAE is concerned about the terrorist threat to the 
<br>UAE, but lacks a comprehensive implementation strategy for 
<br>reducing its vulnerability (ref A).  The UAE considers 
<br>homeland security one of its top priorities, but rather than 
<br>prioritizing national security projects, its efforts have 
<br>focused on contracting risk assessments, forming committees, 
<br>and procuring equipment.  In your meetings, we recommend that 
<br>you inquire about the government's plan, announced by 
<br>President Khalifa in December 2005, to place all the security 
<br>agencies under a newly established National Security Council. 
<br> MbZ, asked by Townsend if the UAE was worried about its oil 
<br>infrastructure, responded emphatically, "absolutely."  He 
<br>told Townsend that there are three international companies 
<br>currently conducting risk assessments of the UAE oil 
<br>infrastructure and maritime security for the UAEG.  Townsend 
<br>offered U.S. assistance in helping the UAE to reduce its 
<br>vulnerability (ref O). 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (S) The UAEG reacts quickly when presented with evidence 
<br>of a terrorist presence inside the UAE, but does not approach 
<br>the problem from a transnational posture.  The UAE's 
<br>immediate response when terrorists pose a risk is to deport 
<br>them.  UAE agencies do not investigate fully to see how far 
<br>the problem goes or whether there is an international network 
<br>involved.  Although the U.S./UAE counterterrorism cooperation 
<br>is strong (with the UAE working closely with the USG on 
<br>specific cases), Emiratis do not consistently share lead 
<br>information found in the possession of individuals in their 
<br>custody with each other or with the U.S. Government.  These 
<br>tactics limit law enforcement and intelligence services' 
<br>ability to use intelligence to disrupt extremist cells and 
<br>planned attacks.  The UAE's insistence on deportation as a 
<br>solution does not protect the country long-term or truly 
<br>address the nature and scope of the problem.  Townsend 
<br>discussed this matter with MbZ and urged the UAE to instead 
<br>to fully investigate terror suspects and share the results of 
<br>those inquiries with the USG. 
<br>Counterterrorism Finance 
<br>------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (S) The UAE has made significant strides in regulating the 
<br>financial sector against money laundering and terrorist 
<br>financing (ref B).  Although the UAE now has a strong legal 
<br>framework in place, it must turn its efforts to enforcement. 
<br>It is imperative that UAE authorities investigate and 
<br>prosecute violators of terror finance/anti-money laundering, 
<br>cash courier, and charity laws and regulations.  To date, 
<br>investigation and prosecution have been weak.  In an effort 
<br>to increase U.S. and UAE cooperation on terrorist financing, 
<br>the 
<br>first meeting of the U.S/UAE Joint Terrorist Finance 
<br>Coordinating Committee (JTFCC) was held in Abu Dhabi on 
<br>January 24, 2005 (ref C).  The UAE team had representatives 
<br>from the Central Bank, State Security, Ministries of 
<br>Interior, Foreign Affairs, and Justice.  However, no one 
<br>participated from Dubai.  In order for the JTFCC to be an 
<br>effective committee, Dubai's Police, State Security, Customs, 
<br>and the Department of Islamic Affairs and Charities must 
<br>participate.  The April 30 meeting will focus on cash 
<br>couriers and charity regulations. 
<br> 
<br>Iran 
<br>---- 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (S/NF) UAE leaders are very concerned about escalating 
<br>tensions between Iran and the international community.  AbZ 
<br>publicly expressed his country's concern, and the entire 
<br>region's "vulnerability," at a press conference in Kuwait 
<br>April 25, while urging a peaceful resolution (ref M). 
<br>Commercial ties between Dubai and Iran are significant (Dubai 
<br>is Iran's largest non-oil trading partner), and as a result 
<br>the UAEG walks a fine line between maintaining and 
<br>encouraging this trade and working to prevent suspected 
<br>Iranian proliferation activities.  Although the UAEG is 
<br>worried about Iran's nuclear ambitions, its short-term policy 
<br>decisions regarding Iran center on not provoking its 
<br>neighbor.  The USG has approached the UAEG four times since 
<br>January, asking it to interdict and inspect cargo suspected 
<br>of going to Iran's nuclear and/or missile programs.  None of 
<br>those instances has resulted in a successful interdiction. 
<br>In the first two instances UAE officials simply refused to 
<br>take action (refs F and G).  The Director of Dubai's State 
<br>Security Organization explained during the 11 February 
<br>U.S./UAE Counterproliferation Task Force meeting that the 
<br>decision not to inspect the containers had been a political 
<br>decision based on the UAE's concern that Iran might retaliate 
<br>(ref H).  In the two later instances (ref K), ships that had 
<br>been scheduled to arrive in Dubai went directly to Bandar 
<br>Abbas.  AbZ told U/S Joseph during his April 8 visit to Abu 
<br>Dhabi that the USG should approach the UAE on interdiction 
<br>requests "only as a last resort" (ref N).  Two weeks later, 
<br>he assured Townsend that the UAEG does not want Iran to take 
<br>advantage of the UAE's open trading environment.  He said the 
<br>UAE was in the final stages of ratifying its export control 
<br>law and that it would be announced "soon."  In an encouraging 
<br>development, the UAE on April 15 privately endorsed the 
<br>Proliferation Security Initiative's Statement of Interdiction 
<br>Principles (ref L). 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (S) In recent meetings with senior USG officials, Abu 
<br>Dhabi's ruling family has expressed clear support for U.S. 
<br>initiatives against Iran.  The U.S. and UAE have a "common 
<br>desire to succeed," AbZ told U/S Joseph, noting that the 
<br>combination of Iran and terrorism is something that cannot be 
<br>tolerated.  "The threat from al-Qa'ida would be minor if Iran 
<br>has nukes," AbZ said (ref N).  MbZ told Townsend April 22 
<br>that the Iranians think that the U.S. will not do anything 
<br>about their recent declaration that they have successfully 
<br>enriched uranium.  He added that he thought the Iranians were 
<br>wrong.  MbZ and UAE Vice President and Prime Minister Sheikh 
<br>Mohammed bin Rashid agreed with Secretary Rice February 23 
<br>about the need to counter Iran's growing influence in the 
<br>region and its nuclear ambitions, although they specified 
<br>that any sanctions should target the key Iranian leadership, 
<br>not the Iranian people (ref I).  MbZ told A/S Welch March 28 
<br>that he did not think it was necessary to wait for all Gulf 
<br>Cooperation Council (GCC) countries to agree before 
<br>proceeding with any U.S. plans against Iran (ref E).  He told 
<br>A/S Welch that the UAE would prepare a paper responding to 
<br>USG concerns about Iran and mechanisms for addressing the 
<br>challenge posed by Iran.  In a March 27 meeting with CENTCOM 
<br>Commander General Abizaid, MbZ spoke about the Iranian threat 
<br>with a greater sense of urgency.  He was strongly in favor of 
<br>taking action against Iran and its president sooner rather 
<br>than later.  "I believe this guy is going to take us to war. 
<br>... It's a matter of time," MbZ warned, adding that action 
<br>against Iran and President Ahmedinejad should be taken this 
<br>year or next year. 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (S/NF) SSD Director Hazza told A/S Welch March 29 that the 
<br>Ayatollah Ali Khameini had once issued a fatwa prohibiting 
<br>the use of nuclear weapons by Iran, but noted that this 
<br>should not be considered a guarantee.  Hazza assessed that 
<br>Iran is also a threat due to its ties to international 
<br>terrorist organizations, including al-Qaida, as well as their 
<br>financial support to Hamas.  He added that the relationship 
<br>between Iran and Syria, and their links to Hizballah, was 
<br>also of concern, as was Iran's attempts to expand its 
<br>influence in Iraq and elsewhere in the world.  MbZ also 
<br>expressed to A/S Welch March 28 the concern that Hizballah 
<br>was supporting Hamas.  During your meetings, you should 
<br>explain the graduated approach to addressing Iran in the 
<br>United Nations Security Council and encourage the UAE to 
<br>isolate Iran--regardless of potential economic backlash.  You 
<br>should also explain the importance of the UAE working closely 
<br>with the USG on interdiction requests.  These meetings will 
<br>be a good follow-on to the discussion U/S Joseph had with AbZ 
<br>April 8, when Joseph outlined the USG's policy priorities for 
<br>Iran.  (Note: While AbZ, like MbZ, expressed support for U.S. 
<br>initiatives against Iran, he stated that the USG should come 
<br>to the UAE as a "very last resort. ... If you can solve 
<br>something without involving the UAE, please do so."  End 
<br>Note.) 
<br> 
<br>Palestinian Territories/Hamas 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (S) UAE leaders have told us that they consider Hamas a 
<br>terrorist organization and that they would not fund Hamas 
<br>unless they denounce violence (refs D and E).  However, after 
<br>Hamas political chief Khaled Meshaal visited Abu Dhabi on 
<br>March 22 and met with UAE Minister of Presidential Affairs 
<br>Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan and Minister of State for 
<br>Foreign Affairs Mohammed al-Sha'ali, Meshaal publicly claimed 
<br>that the UAEG had pledged to continue to provide financial 
<br>assistance to the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority (ref J). 
<br>MbZ told A/S Welch March 28 that the UAEG allowed Meshaal to 
<br>come, but that "officially, we don't recognize Khaled 
<br>Meshaal."  MbZ said that once a new Palestinian Prime 
<br>Minister is selected, UAEG officials will travel to the 
<br>Palestinian territories to ascertain that UAEG assistance is 
<br>"going to the right people."  In his meeting with Townsend, 
<br>MbZ said that the UAE "felt the Muslim Brotherhood rally 
<br>behind Hamas" after its electoral victory in the Palestinian 
<br>territories, and that the Hamas victory should be a lesson to 
<br>the West.  UAE Vice President and Prime Minister Sheikh 
<br>Mohammed bin Rashid sounded a note of optimism when he told 
<br>Secretary Rice February 23 that Hamas, "with some pressure," 
<br> 
<br>SIPDIS 
<br>would understand the need to respect the will of the 
<br>international community. 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (S) The UAE has historically provided significant 
<br>financial assistance to the Palestinian people.  Typically, 
<br>the UAE sends aid to the Palestinian territories through 
<br>charity organizations, or by projectized assistance; but the 
<br>UAEG has also provided financial assistance directly to the 
<br>Palestinian Authority, most recently $20 million in March 
<br>2006 to Mahmoud Abbas for salaries.  In the wake of the Hamas 
<br>electoral victory, UAE leaders told us they intend to honor 
<br>their previous commitments of humanitarian assistance 
<br>(including the $100 million Sheikh Khalifa housing complex 
<br>that was announced last year). 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (S/NF) In his meeting with A/S Welch March 29, SSD 
<br>Director Hazza assessed that there was both a positive and a 
<br>negative side to the Hamas election win.  On the negative 
<br>side, he cited Hamas' position with regard to Israel, and 
<br>their violent agenda.  On the positive side, Hazza noted the 
<br>fact that Hamas was now in power and was accountable to the 
<br>international community.  He spoke to A/S Welch of the threat 
<br>posed by the Muslim Brotherhood.  Hazza also asked A/S Welch 
<br>how the USG would react to those countries that did support 
<br>the Hamas government, and whether they would run afoul of 
<br>U.S. laws restricting support to terrorist organizations. 
<br>A/S Welch replied that that would be a problem, emphasizing 
<br>that no money should go to the government unless Hamas 
<br>renounced violence and accepted Israel.  A/S Welch also told 
<br>Hazza that it was not the responsibility of the U.S. or other 
<br>Arab countries to pay the salaries of the new Hamas 
<br>government, underscoring the need for Hamas to show 
<br>accountability.  MbZ told A/S Welch that Hamas benefited from 
<br>"official and private contributions" from Saudi Arabia, 
<br>Kuwait, and Qatar.  MbZ said it was "easy to take $1 million 
<br>in a suitcase" to Lebanon, alluding to cash couriers. 
<br> 
<br>Iraq 
<br>---- 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (S/NF) A partner in the war on terror, the UAE continues 
<br>to provide U.S. forces access, overflight clearances, and 
<br>other critical logistical assistance to Operation Iraqi 
<br>Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.  The UAE has also 
<br>been a helpful supporter of Iraq's burgeoning political 
<br>process.  It has worked with Iraqi political and religious 
<br>figures to encourage greater Sunni integration, and it has 
<br>consulted with Ambassador Khalilzad on a number of occasions 
<br>about the need to stem sectarianism in Iraq.  The UAE has 
<br>publicly condemned acts of sectarian and terrorist violence 
<br>in Iraq, most recently, the February 22 bombing of the 
<br>al-Askariya Shrine.  MbZ told Townsend that he had "no 
<br>confidence" in the new Iraqi Prime Minister-designate, Jawad 
<br>al-Maliki, and he reiterated his concern about Iran's 
<br>meddling in Iraq's internal affairs.  He has pledged the 
<br>UAE's support to the fight against al-Qaida. 
<br> 
<br>Ideological Extremism 
<br>--------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (S) The Abu Dhabi ruling family continue to be outspoken 
<br>on the issue of Muslim extremists and the threat they pose to 
<br>the region.  MbZ told Townsend that if there were an election 
<br>in Dubai tomorrow, the Muslim Brotherhood would take over. 
<br>He said the challenge is to find a way to remove the 
<br>extremists in a way that they never come back.  One way he 
<br>and his brothers have been trying to accomplish this is by 
<br>reforming the education system, which they say was penetrated 
<br>by the Muslim Brotherhood in the late 1960s.  (Note: The UAE 
<br>has announced that half of the members of the Federal 
<br>National Council would be elected while half would continue 
<br>to be appointed by the rulers of the various emirates. 
<br>Despite this announcement, the UAE still lags behind other 
<br>Gulf states in terms of democratization.  End Note.)  UAE 
<br>officials publicly and strongly condemn extremism and 
<br>terrorist attacks, anti-extremism has been the focus of 
<br>government-approved Friday sermons in the mosques.
