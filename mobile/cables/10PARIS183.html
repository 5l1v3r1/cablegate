<br>REF:09 Paris 1635
<br>
<br>Classified by Amb. Charles H. Rivkin for Reasons 1.5 (b)(d)
<br>
<br>Summary
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) French Environment Minister Jean-Louis Borloo told the
<br>Ambassador that the key to advancing climate negotiations is to drop
<br>the notion of a legally binding treaty in favor of a system of
<br>national commitments. He also argued that it would be up to a small
<br>group of eight or ten heads of state, and their sherpas, to negotiate
<br>implementation of the Copenhagen Accord. Borloo attributed the
<br>European obsession with legally binding treaties to its post-war
<br>history and experience in creating the EU by progressively ceding
<br>sovereignty via treaty. The key to reaching this kind of deal would
<br>be credible action on tradable quotas, forests, and finance including
<br>innovative financing mechanisms. The Copenhagen Accord was not a
<br>failure, but allowing the means to become the ends was a trap. End
<br>Summary.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Ambassador Rivkin called on Minister of State for Sustainable
<br>Development Jean-Louis Borloo on February 11 to review the Copenhagen
<br>Conference and next steps on the Accord. They had last met on the
<br>eve of the conference (reftel.) Borloo expressed in several
<br>different ways the idea that Copenhagen had gone off track because
<br>its approach had been too Western and too European. Major emerging
<br>countries were not prepared to cede sovereignty to a treaty, while EU
<br>members saw this as both normal and essential. Borloo observed that
<br>Copenhagen had, in fact, established a possible global deal on
<br>emissions reductions by the United States, China, and Europe. We
<br>will not get beyond this balance at the next Conference of the
<br>Parties (COP) in Cancun, he said.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Borloo insisted that UNFCCC COP negotiators did not have the
<br>ability to close a deal after years of ongoing negotiations. It was
<br>now up to the major heads of state. He suggested a group of eight or
<br>ten: Germany and France for Europe, the United States, China, India,
<br>Brazil, Algeria and Ethiopia (and possibly South Africa). Once these
<br>leaders, working through their sherpas or personal representatives
<br>agree on an implementation plan for Copenhagen, it will be largely
<br>acceptable to, and accepted by, the rest of the world, and can then
<br>be returned to a UN forum to be finalized. (Borloo dismissed the
<br>role of Spain as the current EU Presidency country, saying that Spain
<br>has exceeded its Kyoto Protocol targets by 50 percent and is mired by
<br>its internal economic situation. The United Nations also did not
<br>have any leadership capacity to advance the negotiations, he said.)
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Borloo argued that the key to implementing the "equilibrium"
<br>revealed at Copenhagen was an arrangement that would be voluntary but
<br>also automatic in implementation and would include tradable emissions
<br>quotas (with linked carbon markets), a forestry mechanism (REDD
<br>Plus), and financing, including innovative financing and a fast start
<br>mechanism. He commented that China would agree to such a system as
<br>far preferable to a U.S. and EU carbon border tax or tariff
<br>arrangement.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Borloo thought that adhesion to the Copenhagen Accord would be
<br>more than adequate to establish its acceptance, and he expected most
<br>of Africa and three quarters of the island states to sign on. He
<br>relayed that France continues to advocate adhesion and said that he
<br>personally was travelling and meeting with key country counterparts,
<br>including China and India.
<br>
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) COMMENT: Borloo conveyed a strategic view of these
<br>negotiations that has changed significantly. We note especially his
<br>assessment that a legally binding instrument is not only unnecessary
<br>but also impossible. He stressed that unlike some Europeans, the
<br>French understood the USG position and had not been critical of the
<br>United States at Copenhagen. In fact, he said, the success of the
<br>Copenhagen Accord for the USG had been the direct engagement of
<br>President Obama. END COMMENT.
<br>
<br>¶7. (U) Borloo also passed a letter from himself, on behalf of the
<br>French people, to Secretary of Energy Chu expressing condolences for
<br>the loss of life at the Kleen Energy Power plant in Middletown,
<br>Connecticut, and expressing his wish that those injured in the
<br>explosion recover quickly. The Embassy has faxed the letter to the
<br>Department of Energy.
