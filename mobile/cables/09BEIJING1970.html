<br>
<br>Summary 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) A jump in the number of "mass incidents," or violent 
<br>protests against local governments, in June is unrelated to 
<br>the recent ethnic riots in Xinjiang and does not signal a 
<br>threat to overall social stability, Embassy contacts report. 
<br>However, violent incidents indicate serious discontent below 
<br>the surface that will worsen over time. The underlying 
<br>causes are longstanding citizen hostility toward local 
<br>officials due to corruption and abuse of power in China's 
<br>Communist Party-controlled political order. Moreover, vested 
<br>interests are pushing their demands more aggressively during 
<br>a year of politically sensitive anniversaries, calculating 
<br>that the authorities will be more inclined to compromise in 
<br>the interest of maintaining stability. The Party has 
<br>responded by boosting anti-riot training for local officials, 
<br>temporarily broadening the boundaries for expression of 
<br>public opinion on the Internet while simultaneously targeting 
<br>specific websites for tight control, and attempting to 
<br>re-invigorate village elections. Contacts tell us that on 
<br>campus, a tight student job market will not likely lead to 
<br>destabilizing political activism in the short run, but the 
<br>rise of left-wing nationalism is a trend to watch. The 
<br>Xinjiang riots are different in kind and origin, but, like 
<br>mass incidents, show the volatility of pent-up frustration 
<br>and anger across China. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>Violent Protests in June: Hubei and Jiangxi 
<br>------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) A wave of new "mass incidents" (China's term for 
<br>protest activity that the leadership views as threatening to 
<br>stability) erupted in June in several parts of China and was 
<br>widely reported in local media. In one of the two major 
<br>incidents, a June 17-20riot in Shishou City, Hubei Province, 
<br>was triggered by the mysterious death of a chef in a 
<br>government-owned hotel. The number of rioters quickly 
<br>swelled from a few dozen to thousands as rumors spread that 
<br>the chef was murdered by the hotel manager, in league with 
<br>city officials, for threatening to disclose an alleged drug 
<br>ring run out of the hotel. The riot was quelled after 
<br>hundreds of rioters were injured in clashes with security 
<br>forces and many police vehicles were damaged or destroyed. 
<br>Another large protest was staged by more than one hundred 
<br>furniture makers in Nankang City, Jiangxi Province, on June 
<br>¶15. The furniture makers gathered in front of the city 
<br>government building to protest a new tax on the industry 
<br>already hit hard by declining export demand. The Nankang 
<br>demonstrators overturned police vehicles and blocked a major 
<br>highway for several hours. The protest subsided the same day 
<br>when municipal authorities rescinded the tax on orders from 
<br>the provincial governor. 
<br>
<br>Mass Incidents Are Not All the Same 
<br>----------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX  emphasized to  PolOff on
<br>June 26 that the Hubei and Jiangxi incidents,  respectively,
<br>represented different kinds of social protests  even
<br>though both were indicative of simmering discontent 
<br>lying just below the surface of Chinese society. He said 
<br>that Shishou was similar to the Weng'an riots in Guizhou 
<br>Province last year in which pent-up anger toward the 
<br>government erupted spontaneously in response to an event that 
<br>had little or no relationship to the immediate concerns or 
<br>grievances of the protestors. (Note. See ref: as many as 
<br>30,000 protestors rioted for several days in June 2008, 
<br>destroying the Wengan Party headquarters and other official 
<br>property. The local Party Secretary eventually resigned.) 
<br>While disturbing to the leadership, such events were 
<br>nonetheless isolated, localized incidents that could be 
<br>contained, XXXXXXXXXXXX observed. The violence in
<br>Jiangxi, on the  other hand, represented a systemic problem, in
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX  view. 
<br>This kind of protest was more dangerous, he said, because it 
<br>was issue-driven and affected interests that cut across local 
<br>and regional boundaries, and hence held the potential to 
<br>spread to other areas. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX said it was very difficult 
<br>to assess the overall impact of mass incidents on social 
<br>stability, but, like XXXXXXXXXXXX, he stressed the
<br>importance of  distinguishing between the spontaneous,
<br>random violence of  Weng'an and Shishou and protests
<br>driven by the clash of 
<br>
<br>BEIJING 00001970 002 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>"vested interests" (liyi you guanfang). In a meeting with 
<br>PolOff on June 30, XXXXXXXXXXXX said that Weng'an-type
<br> riots tended  to be "seasonal" in nature, occurring during the
<br>summer when  lots of people were in the streets. The Jiangxi
<br>protest, on the other hand, was triggered by those with veste
<br> interests  of all kinds. XXXXXXXXXXXX stated that there
<br>had been many such  protests recently: In addition to the widely
<br>publicized  taxi-driver strikes in several provinces, there had been
<br>bus driver strikes, elementary and middle-school teacher strikes 
<br>(Chongqing), and wharf worker and boatmen strikes (in 
<br>Guizhou), among others, all of which involved disputes over 
<br>salaries. XXXXXXXXXXXX said the timing of these strikes
<br>and protests  was deliberate. Once Party leaders had declared 2009
<br>a year of sensitive anniversaries and had called for redoubled 
<br>efforts to ensure "harmony" and stability, people pressed 
<br>hard for the government to satisfy their demands, calculating 
<br>that authorities would be more responsive in order to 
<br>maintain stability. 
<br>
<br>Underlying Cause: China's Party System 
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) The heart of the problem, XXXXXXXXXXXX explained,
<br>was a  political order that gave local officials enormous power, 
<br>including control over the distribution of wealth and the 
<br>resources to ensure that their own interests were well 
<br>served. As a result, XXXXXXXXXXXX said, this "structural 
<br>contradiction" had resulted in a long-term hostile 
<br>environment, characterized by a breakdown of trust between 
<br>local officials and residents and near-total lack of official 
<br>credibility. When officials spoke, XXXXXXXXXXXX said,
<br>"no one pays  attention" because "no one believes anything
<br>a cadre says."  In his view, this situation unfairly penalized those 
<br>officials who were capable and honest, with a recent case in 
<br>Zhengzhou, Henan province being the most recent example. In 
<br>a slip of the tongue that brought the point home, a Zhengzhou 
<br>official became the focus of Internet praise and ridicule 
<br>when he admitted in a public exchange with a reporter that 
<br>China's media and local officials served the interests of the 
<br>Party rather than the people. In response to a state-owned 
<br>radio reporter's criticism of city officials for illegally 
<br>building luxury villas on land that had been allocated for 
<br>low-income housing, the official angrily shot back "for whom 
<br>do you speak, the Party or the people," with the clear 
<br>implication that he and the reporter both spoke for the 
<br>Party. The reporter, apparently not realizing the 
<br>implications of the remark, published it as an example of 
<br>imperious officialdom. Some netizens praised the official 
<br>for speaking the truth while others mocked him for blatantly 
<br>ignoring the interests of ordinary people. The phrase "for 
<br>whom do you speak" became the catch phrase of the day on the 
<br>Internet, a symbol of people's deep distrust of officials and 
<br>anger at the systemic disregard for rule of law and citizen 
<br>rights. This was a "structural" problem, XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>repeated,  embedded in the nature of the cadre system, which
<br>even  President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao had so far
<br>been unable to crack, despite robust efforts. The situation could 
<br>only get worse before it gets better, XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br> concluded, thus,  "we can expect more and more "mass incidents." 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C XXXXXXXXXXXX, too, asserted that "structural 
<br>contradictions" lay at the heart of the mass incident 
<br>problem. People saw official machinations, corruption, or 
<br>avarice behind every negative event, he said, noting the 
<br>recent collapse of a 13-story building in Shanghai as the 
<br>most recent example of this mindset. Shanghai was one of 
<br>China's better-run cities, with an experienced and savvy 
<br>cadre force and a clean Party Secretary, XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>opined, but  people immediately jumped to the conclusion
<br>that corruption  was the culprit. (Note: Chinese media have since
<br>reported  that the collapse was caused by inept construction
<br>workers  who allowed dirt to pile up on one side of the building
<br>even  as they excavated a deep hole on the other side.) However, 
<br>this lack of trust and credibility showed a deeper flaw in 
<br>China's political order. As a result, XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br> predicted, more  mass incidents lay ahead. Although people
<br>blamed local  officials for their problems and still viewed the
<br>central  government as their last hope for redress of grievances
<br> this  could change if the financial crisis persisted. 
<br>
<br>Rights Lawyer: no Threat to Stability 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX  told PolOffs on June 23 that
<br>he thought that mass incidents  had not reached a stage
<br>where they posed a threat to China's  overall stability. 
<br>While they represented an expression of general anger
<br>over citizens' personal situations and deep  resentment
<br>toward Party officials, they were still localized. 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX said the underlying dynamic was
<br>a self-perpetuating cycle 
<br>
<br>BEIJING 00001970 003 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>of violence and counter-violence on both sides born of a 
<br>"contradiction" in citizen-official relationships. If local 
<br>authorities were actually to follow the law, he observed, 
<br>this would mean relaxing control and allowing more freedom of 
<br>expression. People would respond by criticizing the 
<br>government or by making demands that authorities were not 
<br>willing to meet. Thus, XXXXXXXXXXXX explained,
<br>authorities kept a  tight lid on all social discontent which in
<br>turn fostered  seething resentment that periodically erupte
<br> into violent  protest. The official response to these protests often 
<br>amplified popular anger and frustration, thus continuing the 
<br>cycle. There will be no "Chinese Gorbachev," he exclaimed, 
<br>no breakthrough in the short term. The only answer, in
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX’s  view, was continued, gradual, and
<br>patient education in "the  spirit of rule of law" among the people
<br>to eliminate their  "slave mentality." 
<br>
<br>Cadre Training, Internet Control, Local Elections 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX said that the "lessons of Weng'an,"
<br>both  positive and negative, had been carefully studied by
<br>central authorities and that, in anticipation of an upsurge in 
<br>protests this year, the central government had launched an 
<br>ambitious program of anti-riot and crowd-control training for 
<br>local officials. Three thousand county level administrators, 
<br>3,000 county-level public security directors, 2,000 
<br>county-level discipline inspection directors and 500 local 
<br>procuratorate cadres had already completed such training in 
<br>Beijing. They were in turn expected to train the relevant 
<br>personnel in subordinate jurisdictions. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX also claimed that the Party had bee
<br> following a  carefully calibrated approach to Internet control
<br>during the  year, especially in the runup to National Day,
<br>allowing more  general expression of public opinion, while
<br>targeting specific websites for close monitoring. The highly 
<br>publicized webchats with netizens conducted by Hu Jintao and 
<br>Wen Jiabao earlier in the year were designed to reinforce the 
<br>public perception that top leaders were encouraging greater 
<br>public discussion on the Internet, according to XXXXXXXXXXXX. 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX  himself had noticed a significant uptick
<br>in the volume of  Internet chatter, including provocative
<br>commentary on sensitive issues. (Note: Recent examples include
<br>an article  in the June 1 issue of the Xinhua-owned news weekly
<br>Outlook  Weekly (Liaowang) analyzing the factors that contribute
<br> to mass incidents and predicting a significant increase of such 
<br>events this year; and a blog by a Shishou official who was 
<br>critical of the city government's efforts to "mislead the 
<br>public" by blaming the riot on local criminals. The official 
<br>called for an objective analysis of the causes of the riots, 
<br>which he attributed to poor government and police corruption 
<br>in Shishou, to prevent such events in the future.) 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) At the same time, XXXXXXXXXXXX said, the Party
<br>was targeting  "ideological" and "protest" websites of both the
<br>right and  the left for more aggressive monitoring. In addition to
<br>the usual practice of issuing propaganda guidance by telephone, 
<br>text message, or by directives to select webmasters, 
<br>propaganda authorities were now designating specific websites 
<br>as sites of special concern. He said that the State Council 
<br>and Beijing Information Offices recently convened a meeting 
<br>of Internet monitors to discuss tight control of seven 
<br>websites: Two ultra-left sites, Utopia (wuyou zhi xiang) and 
<br>Maoflag; a site featuring a wide range of reform-oriented 
<br>urban middle-class views, Boke (Bokee); and four sites with a 
<br>"liberal" reputation frequented by professionals and 
<br>intellectuals: Xici, Tianya, Tianyi, and China Elections. 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX; XXXXXXXXXXXX said that he had
<br>been told by a friend with Internet monitoring responsibility
<br>that there would be a drastic tightening up on Internet content
<br>next year, once the sensitive commemoration season was over. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Taking a somewhat different tack, XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br> told PolOff on XXXXXXXXXXXX that, in light of
<br>high-profile  unrest incidents, the Communist Party was
<br>looking to  revitalize village elections as a means of relieving
<br>social  pressures and providing a nonviolent outlet to political 
<br>grievances. Specifically, the Party's Central Organization 
<br>Department had recently convened a meeting on ensuring 
<br>compliance with existing legislation mandating regular 
<br>village elections. In recent years apathy and corruption on 
<br>the part of local officials had resulted in many villages 
<br>failing to hold elections as required by law. According to 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX, the Party viewed this as a dangerous
<br>trend  that could  exacerbate the simmering grievances.
<br>Nonetheless, XXXXXXXXXXXX was  not optimistic that
<br>village elections could realize the  Party's goal of reducing
<br>the frequency of unrest.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Student Activism: Leftist Nationalism, Not Employment 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------- 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX said he didn't foresee a stability
<br>problem emerging from the tight job market for graduating
<br>college students, but he was concerned about the increase of
<br>"radical  nationalism" and a "leftward drift" among college
<br>students that could lead to destabilizing student activism in the 
<br>future. Graduating seniors and graduate students at China's 
<br>elite universities were having no trouble finding jobs, he 
<br>said, although those from second- and third-tier universities 
<br>were running into greater obstacles. However, potential 
<br>discontent over job pressure was offset by the many graduates 
<br>who had responded to the Party's call, and incentives, to 
<br>take jobs in the hinterland and by the thousands more who 
<br>were lining up to join the military. Growing student 
<br>nationalism, on the other hand, was a trend to be concerned 
<br>about, in XXXXXXXXXXXX's view, especially when wedded to
<br>"leftist" politics. He said he had warned Party leaders that the 
<br>student threat of the future would not come from 
<br>pro-democracy activists but from the anti-democratic left who 
<br>may take to the streets to demand a return to "true 
<br>socialism." XXXXXXXXXXXX estimated that as many
<br>as 20 percent of  the students at People's University were
<br>"left-leaning  radical nationalists." Many, he said, were active
<br>on the  ultra-left web portal "Utopia" where they posted
<br>comments  under the rubric of "the alliance of citizens
<br>on the left"  (gongmin zuo lianmeng). 
<br>
<br>Mass Incidents Are Not Ethnic Riots 
<br>----------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Ethnic riots like those in Xinjiang July 5-7 and in 
<br>Tibet in March of 2008 differ markedly in origin and nature 
<br>from mass incidents, XXXXXXXXXXXX emphasized to 
<br>PolOff on XXXXXXXXXXXX. Both present serious problems
<br>for the  Party, XXXXXXXXXXXX said, but the Party
<br>leadership would not hesitate  to open fire on Uighurs or
<br>Tibetans if they deemed it  necessary to restore order.
<br>Mass incidents pose a different  kind of threat, he said,
<br>as the leadership is "afraid" to  fire on Han rioters for fear
<br>of sparking massive public  outrage that would turn against
<br>the Party. XXXXXXXXXXXX told PolOff on
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX  that the Xinjiang riots and the June
<br>mass incidents were  different in kind but shared an important
<br>similarity. In her  view, at least some rioters in Xinjiang
<br>took to the streets  because of general discontent unrelated to
<br>the immediate  cause of the violence. Han people do not hate
<br>Uighurs and  are not looking for revenge, she said, but some
<br>people "can always find an excuse to express their grievances."
