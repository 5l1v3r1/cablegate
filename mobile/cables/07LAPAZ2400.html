<br>Summary 
<br>- - - - 
<br>
<br>¶1. (U) Following Minister of the Presidency Quintana's August 
<br>29 attacks on USAID in which he accused the USG of supporting 
<br>the opposition and told USAID to get in line with government 
<br>policies or leave the country, the opposition, NGOs and 
<br>pundits are defending USAID and criticizing the government 
<br>for the unwarranted attack. The official State Department 
<br>response to the Bolivian government's accusations has 
<br>received wide coverage, and many editorials are suggesting 
<br>that the MAS attack on USAID is a smokescreen to cover recent 
<br>domestic problems including civic strikes, rising inflation 
<br>and Venezuelan cash assistance.

<br>
<br>¶2. (U) Many political commentators and opposition 
<br>politicians have drawn attention to the timing of Minister 
<br>Quintana's diatribe, coming as it did only a day after six of 
<br>Bolivia's nine departments shut down in strikes against the 
<br>ruling MAS government. The head of the opposition party 
<br>National Unity (UN) Samuel Doria Medina said, "It's an old 
<br>method of (Hugo) Chavez. Every time he has a domestic 
<br>problem, he insults the U.S. government and fights with them. 
<br>It's no coincidence that on Tuesday there was a massive 
<br>strike against the government of Evo Morales, and that now 
<br>Quintana comes out to tell lies and hoaxes." In the words of 
<br>Carlos Hugo Molina, one of the former government officials 
<br>(under Goni Sanchez de Lozada) listed by Quintana as evidence 
<br>that USAID is financing the "old way" and the opposition: 
<br>"They are trying to scare us...this should be denounced at 
<br>international levels." Another USAID contractor, Juan Carlos 
<br>Urenda (a Santa Cruz civic leader) described the MAS 
<br>accusations as an attempt to cast a smokescreen over the 
<br>"serious problems in this country," and opined that this was 
<br>"another mistake of the government that will do no less than 
<br>deepen the differences and confrontations in the country."

<br>
<br>¶3. (C) On August 29, as Minister Quintana criticized USAID's 
<br>"flagrant interference in Bolivian politics", President 
<br>Morales was handing out Venezuelan checks to mayors in the 
<br>department of La Paz. In the past, President Morales has 
<br>publicly called for European, Japanese and U.S. aid to be 
<br>more like Venezuelan aid, which in practice would mean almost 
<br>no accountability or transparency. In his attack on USAID, 
<br>Minister Quintana praised European aid for being transparent 
<br>and for following Bolivian laws. Although Quintana did not 
<br>directly mention Venezuelan aid, the MAS is clearly 
<br>responding to criticism of the increasing Venezuelan 
<br>influence in the country. The official government news 
<br>source ABI on August 30 ran an article describing how 
<br>President Morales has been handing out "cooperation checks" 
<br>from Venezuela and Europe. This attempted conflation of 
<br>Venezuelan and European aid seems to be a MAS attempt to both 
<br>isolate the United States and justify its acceptance of 
<br>increasing Venezuelan involvement in the country. Following 
<br>Quintana's presentation, Vice President Garcia Linera 
<br>announced that the Bolivian government will push for a new 
<br>law to control the destination of international aid and will 
<br>
<br>LA PAZ 00002400 002 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>investigate the programs of all international aid in Bolivia.

<br>
<br>¶4. (U) Many Bolivians are concerned about the more immediate 
<br>and concrete impact that could result from poking a stick at 
<br>the United States. The Bolivian External Trade Institute 
<br>(IBCE) is concerned for the future of ATPDEA, pointing out 
<br>that Bolivia is even now preparing a proposal for the 
<br>extension of ATPDEA trade preferences. IBCE head Gary 
<br>Rodriguez stated, "We understand that the (Bolivian) 
<br>Government doesn't need trade preferences, but the workers do 
<br>need them, as do entrepreneurs who seek to consolidate and 
<br>not lose free access for their exports." 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) More directly, many observers are pointing out that 
<br>Bolivia cannot afford to risk USD120 million in assistance 
<br>from USAID. Few are suggesting that all USAID assistance 
<br>could be lost, but concerns are rife that funding could be 
<br>reduced in the future. While Morales and the MAS may be 
<br>willing to wave goodbye to our assistance, other officials 
<br>either doubt that Venezuela will step up to completely fill 
<br>the gap or, pragmatically, see a benefit in receiving as much 
<br>aid as possible from various sources. (Comment: At a time 
<br>when Vice President Linera is heading to Washington to, among 
<br>other issues, push for Millennium Challenge aid to Bolivia 
<br>and a continuation of ATPDEA trade benefits, the timing of 
<br>the attacks against the USG seems self-defeating. End 
<br>comment.)

<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Minister Quintana also announced his "suspicions of 
<br>U.S. double morality" in the fight against drugs, questioning 
<br>the U.S. focus on cocaine in Bolivia while claiming that 
<br>marijuana is not part of counternarcotics programs here. 
<br>Quintana said that the Bolivian government is investigating 
<br>NAS assistance and will publish their findings in the 
<br>following weeks. (Comment: It is understandable that a 
<br>government whose president is also the head of the 
<br>coca-growers union would turn its sights on NAS's programs. 
<br>Considering the egregious accusations that the Bolivian 
<br>government has just leveled at USAID, we expect that their 
<br>'investigation' of NAS will be equally rigorous. End 
<br>comment.)

<br>
<br>¶7. (C) In the wake of Quintana's press conference, USAID has 
<br>received an outpouring of support. Many partner NGOs are 
<br>publicly challenging the government's accusations, and some 
<br>have requested more information from USAID in order to 
<br>repudiate the MAS stance. Morale in USAID could take a hit, 
<br>particularly among the Bolivian locally-engaged staff, some 
<br>of whom fear that after Quintana's threats and insinuations 
<br>about 'traitors' who 'sell out their country', they may be 
<br>targeted by the MAS in the future. Their fears are not 
<br>unfounded, considering that Quintana named USAID contractors, 
<br>listed their posts in previous governments, and accused them 
<br>of working against the MAS program of change. To address 
<br>initial concerns and assure employees of USG support, USAID 
<br>held an all-hands staff meeting right after Quintana's press 
<br>briefing. The Ambassador will hold a mission wide townhall 
<br>meeting immediately upon his return to La Paz.
