<br>
<br>
<br>Classified By: DCM Bob Manzanares; reason 1.4 (B) and (D).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary. The Ambassador met with Vice President Maria
<br>Teresa Fernandez de la Vega on June 8 to review bilateral
<br>relations and to discuss regional issues of joint interest,
<br>including developments in Peru, Bolivia, Iran, Syria, and
<br>North Africa. Regarding the CIA flights issue, Vice
<br>President de la Vega said Spain's inclusion in the Council of
<br>Europe report had caught the Zapatero Government totally off
<br>guard and she insisted Spain had nothing to hide on the
<br>issue. She said the Spanish Government felt comfortable that
<br>it could contend with domestic concerns regarding CIA flights
<br>through Spain, asking only that the USG provide Spain any
<br>relevant information to avoid any surprises. De la Vega made
<br>a strong pitch for increased USG-Spanish collaboration on
<br>North Africa (NOTE: FM Moratinos will likely raise this
<br>during his June 19 meeting with the Secretary. END NOTE).
<br>On Iran, de la Vega agreed with the need to maintain a
<br>unified international voice on Iran's nuclear program, saying
<br>Javier Solana was the appropriate interlocutor with Tehran.
<br>She welcomed Alan Garcia's victory in Peru, but lamented that
<br>in Bolivia Evo Morales appeared to be under the direction of
<br>the most negative leftist elements in his administration.
<br>End Summary.
<br>
<br>//BILATERAL RELATIONS IMPROVING//
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Vice President de la Vega said she was aware of FM
<br>Miguel Angel Moratinos' upcoming meeting with the Secretary,
<br>as well as MOD Alonso's June 8 meeting with Secretary
<br>Rumsfeld on the margins of the NATO ministerial. She
<br>expressed satisfaction with the improvements in the bilateral
<br>relationship over the last year. The Ambassador agreed that
<br>we had made progress, adding that there was much more that
<br>our countries could do together. The Ambassador
<br>congratulated the Zapatero Government for its handling of the
<br>thorny Catalan autonomy issue. De la Vega said that the
<br>Zapatero administration was convinced that the Catalan issue
<br>was nearing a successful conclusion and predicted that the
<br>June 18 referendum in the Catalan Region would go smoothly
<br>and result in public acceptance of a renegotiated autonomy
<br>statute. The Ambassador reviewed his plans to visit the
<br>Basque Region June 22-23, a visit focused on business issues,
<br>but also including a courtesy call on Basque Regional
<br>Government leader Juan Jose Ibarretxe. Vice President de la
<br>Vega expressed no concern regarding such a visit.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) The Ambassador informed de la Vega of the June 28-29
<br>visit of Education Secretary Spellings, noting Secretary
<br>Spellings' strong background on foreign affairs and lengthy
<br>government career. He said that while he would not normally
<br>suggest Vice President de la Vega meet visiting cabinet
<br>officials, it could be worthwhile to arrange a brief meeting.
<br>De la Vega said she would welcome such a meeting if her
<br>schedule permitted.
<br>
<br>//CIA FLIGHTS//
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) The Ambassador said that FM Moratinos had recently
<br>advised him that Spain's National Court had accepted a case
<br>filed by a private individual alleging USG wrongdoing in
<br>Spain during the transit of Spanish airports by CIA aircraft.
<br>Moratinos indicated the Spanish Government's desire to give
<br>this issue as low a profile as possible, though, as a
<br>judicial case, the government had a limited capacity to
<br>influence the direction of the case. De la Vega said she was
<br>aware of FM Moratinos' communication on this issue and
<br>expressed confidence that the Zapatero Government could
<br>manage it with little difficulty. (NOTE: According to June 9
<br>press reports, government prosecutors have expressed
<br>opposition to the National Court's hearing of a case in which
<br>there is no evidence of a crime having been committed. END
<br>NOTE).
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) By contrast, she said, the Zapatero Government had
<br>been surprised by the Council of Europe report alleging that
<br>Spain "permitted or failed to investigate" the use of
<br>Mallorca as a staging point for the "illegal" transfer of
<br>individuals by the CIA. (NOTE: An MFA spokesperson roundly
<br>denied any involvement by Spain in the illegal transfer of
<br>
<br>MADRID 00001490 002.2 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>suspected terrorists. END NOTE). De la Vega said Spain was
<br>prepared to deal with this issue, but wanted to be certain
<br>that it had all the information available regarding the
<br>flights to avoid being caught unprepared. The Ambassador
<br>noted that we too had an interest in preserving our
<br>credibility and were careful to share whatever information we
<br>had and to avoid any actions that might create problems for
<br>the Spanish authorities. De la Vega emphasized that Spain
<br>had no objection to USG intelligence flights through Spanish
<br>territory; they simply wanted to be kept informed and, if
<br>necessary, to be able to demonstrate that they were
<br>exercising proper oversight of foreign aircraft passing
<br>through Spain.
<br>
<br>//IRAN, SYRIA//
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) The Ambassador recounted his last meeting with
<br>President Zapatero, during which Zapatero identified Iran as
<br>the greatest threat to peace in the Broader Middle East. The
<br>Ambassador said this was precisely the view of the USG and
<br>that this underscored the importance of the USG's historic
<br>decision to directly join the multilateral discussions with
<br>Iran. He said it was vital at this critical phase that Iran
<br>see a united international front, determined to prevent its
<br>production of nuclear weapons. Vice President de la Vega
<br>emphatically agreed, saying Javier Solana was the appropriate
<br>interlocutor to deliver a unified message to Iran. The
<br>Ambassador conveyed a similar message on the need to maintain
<br>the consensus limiting high level contacts with Syria in
<br>order to prevent Damascus from driving a wedge between
<br>allies. Vice President de la Vega agreed on this point as
<br>well.
<br>
<br>//PERU, BOLIVIA, ARGENTINA//
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Vice President de la Vega expressed satisfaction with
<br>the "good news" of Alan Garcia's victory in Peru, but
<br>lamented that Bolivian President Evo Morales seemed to be
<br>under the sway of his extreme left Vice President. Without
<br>naming Venezuelan President Chavez, de la Vega indicated
<br>Spain's conviction that other "negative influences" were also
<br>at work in Bolivia. The Ambassador said that Chavez was
<br>certainly eager to exert influence, but that Castro was
<br>likely just as involved, though with more subtlety than
<br>Chavez. De la Vega said that one positive development
<br>resulting from Chavez' meddling was realization by Brazilian
<br>President Lula da Silva that Chavez represented a genuine
<br>threat to Brazilian interests in the region, just as Peruvian
<br>President-elect Garcia, and to a lesser extent Chilean
<br>President Bachelet, understood the nature of the threat.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) The Ambassador asked for Spain's view on whether
<br>Argentine President Kirchner was likewise growing wary of
<br>Chavez. De la Vega said that Kirchner was a special case, in
<br>that he felt a strong affinity towards both President
<br>Zapatero and Vice President de la Vega. She said she
<br>believed Spain could influence his actions in a positive
<br>direction and noted that he would be making a state visit to
<br>Spain in the near future.
<br>
<br>//NORTH AFRICA//
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Turning to her previous meeting with the Ambassador,
<br>de la Vega recalled having urged the USG to increase
<br>collaboration with Spain in promoting stability in North
<br>Africa. She asked whether the Ambassador saw any chance of
<br>progress on this issue. The Ambassador said that the USG was
<br>actively considering various approaches on North Africa, in
<br>light of the stalemate on Western Sahara and other sources of
<br>tension. He suggested the Spanish Government present the USG
<br>and other interested parties a detailed explanation of how it
<br>intends to move forward on North Africa and recommend what
<br>others could do to promote such an initiative. (NOTE: Our
<br>sense is that FM Moratinos may raise this issue in his June
<br>19 meeting with the Secretary. END NOTE).
<br>
<br>//COMMENT//
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) As with the Ambassador's last meeting with Vice
<br>President de la Vega in April, the atmosphere was relaxed and
<br>
<br>MADRID 00001490 003.2 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>cordial throughout. The key message being relayed by the
<br>Spanish Government through the nature and frequency of these
<br>meetings is that they want to put bilateral relations on an
<br>even keel. They do not use these encounters to press for a
<br>meeting between Presidents Bush and Zapatero, an objective
<br>they appear to have abandoned for the moment. Instead, the
<br>Zapatero Government seems content to use the Vice President's
<br>channel with the Ambassador to transmit where they see
<br>opportunities for cooperation (Africa, Latin America) and to
<br>assess the USG's view of the overall state of the bilateral
<br>relationship.
