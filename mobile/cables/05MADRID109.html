<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Poloff delivered reftel points to Deputy National
<br>Security Adviser Maria Jesus Alonso on 1/11, following up on
<br>recent Embassy calls on Alonso and other GOS officials to
<br>encourage Spanish participation in ISAF Stage II through
<br>leadership of a PRT. Poloff stressed the importance of the
<br>issue to the USG and to NATO of Spanish participation at a
<br>substantive level. Poloff said that the USG had been
<br>confused by mixed signals regarding Spain's readiness to
<br>participating in NATO expansion into western Afghanistan. On
<br>the one hand, we understood from our GOS interlocutors in
<br>Madrid that President Zapatero has made no decision regarding
<br>the scope and nature of the Spanish deployment in ISAF II and
<br>that Spain's new requirement of "consultations" with
<br>Parliament prior to new deployments presented a further
<br>political complication. However, in NATO/ISAF councils,
<br>Spanish officials indicated a readiness to proceed with new
<br>deployments, including a possible PRT. Specifically, Spanish
<br>officials on a recent scouting mission to Afghanistan seemed
<br>prepared to support a doubling of the Spanish deployment to
<br>1,000 troops and perhaps to take on a PRT in Qaleh-ye and/or
<br>the Herat FSB. The USG took this to mean that Spain is
<br>leaning towards leading a PRT.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Alonso said that Spain understood its commitment to
<br>the NATO mission in Afghanistan and would continue to
<br>participate in that mission. She emphasized that the
<br>composition of Spanish forces would be based primarily on the
<br>recommendations of the MFA and MOD. While she hadn't yet
<br>seen the recommendations of the Spanish team that visited
<br>Afghanistan January 7-10, she said their input would be
<br>important in operational terms. Alonso said she did not
<br>expect the requirement for consultations with Parliament to
<br>be a problem, except with respect to timing since Parliament
<br>does not reconvene until the first week in February. She
<br>cautioned, however, that the GOS had to bear in mind public
<br>skepticism of Spanish involvement in virtually any military
<br>mission, which Afghanistan certainly was despite the
<br>humanitarian component. Also, she suggested that Spain's
<br>recent deployment to support tsunami relief operations in
<br>Indonesia (594 troops, five airplanes, two helicopters, a
<br>medical unit, and several ships) had stretched Spanish
<br>manpower and resources, which might present a problem GOS
<br>planners hadn't forseen with repect to the GOS contribution
<br>to Afghanistan. The mission in Indonesia is currently
<br>expected to last two months.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Poloff also delivered reftel points to MFA Deputy
<br>Director General for Foreign Policy Felix Costales and noted
<br>our confusion regarding Spain's position on leading a PRT.
<br>Costales said that a PRT would be a very new type of project
<br>for the GOS and that there were ongoing internal discussions
<br>regarding the composition of a Spanish-led PRT. Most
<br>importantly, Spain did not want a primarily military PRT such
<br>as those led by the U.S. and the UK, but instead wanted to
<br>emphasize the humanitarian aspect of such a mission. Like
<br>Alonso, Costales noted that Spain's delivery of aid and
<br>assistance to victims of the tsunami disaster presented a
<br>possible complication for Spain's contribution to ISAF Stage
<br>II.
<br>
<br>//COMMENT//
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) We have heavily lobbied the GOS at all levels of the
<br>MOD, MFA, and the President's staff to lead a PRT and/or
<br>other important missions in Afghanistan. General B. B. Bell
<br>made a strong pitch to Spanish officers on the margins of a
<br>1/10 visit to his NATO counterpart in Madrid. While the GOS
<br>military is clearly anxious to take on a larger role, their
<br>political leaders are far more cautious. In a recent meeting
<br>with Charge, National Security Adviser equivalent Carles
<br>Casajuana was adamant that no new Spanish deployment could
<br>move forward without Parliamentary approval. Spain's
<br>contribution to tsunami relief operations is a new twist and
<br>could tempt the GOS to further delay a tough decision on its
<br>participation in ISAF II. We will continue to push the GOS
<br>hard on this issue, but recognize that their strong aversion
<br>to operations that could result in military casualties is a
<br>very significant impediment. Zapatero's officials are well
<br>aware that the popularity of his government is based mainly
<br>on his reversal of former President Aznar's unpopular
<br>decision to deploy Spanish forces to Iraq. The GOS does not
<br>want to give the opposition a similar opportunity.
