<br>CLASSIFIED BY EUR/FO ? IAN KELLY, REASONS: 1.4 (B) AND (D).
<br>
<br>¶1. (U) This is an action request. Embassy Moscow,
<br>please see paragraph 8.
<br>
<br>BACKGROUND
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) Over the past four years the USG has raised its
<br>concerns with the Government of Russia (GOR) about the
<br>Government of Venezuela's (GOV) possible acquisition
<br>of MANPADS and other conventional weapons. In
<br>particular, we have highlighted the risk these could
<br>be diverted to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
<br>Colombia (FARC) or other regional terrorists and non-
<br>state actors.
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) The Igla-S (SA-24) is Russia's most advanced
<br>MANPADS and considered one of the most lethal portable
<br>air defense systems ever made (Ref A). Currently,
<br>Venezuela's tactical air defense inventory consists of
<br>1970s-era Swedish (RBS-70) and 1980s-era French
<br>systems (Mistral), which are both crew-served systems.
<br>If the SA-24 transfer occurs, it would be Venezuela's
<br>first man-portable air defense weapon. The United
<br>States and Russia have been very involved in efforts
<br>to prevent the proliferation of MANPADS and strengthen
<br>controls over their export. Of particular concern is
<br>preventing the transfer of such systems into regions
<br>known to foster unreliable end-users. We are
<br>concerned with Venezuela?s ability to properly secure
<br>and safeguard small arms and light weapons (SA/LW).
<br>We see no indication that Venezuela is prepared to
<br>implement adequate physical security and stockpile
<br>management practices for such systems consistent with
<br>international standards.
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) In 2005, we reiterated U.S. concerns regarding
<br>arms sales to Venezuela during a meeting with Anatoliy
<br>Antonov, MFA Director for Disarmament and Security
<br>Affairs (Ref B). Antonov said that he and his
<br>Department's experts had carefully considered the
<br>points we had presented and had shared them with
<br>Russian services. Antonov stressed that there was no
<br>international restriction on selling arms, including
<br>MANPADS, to Venezuela. Russia recognized the U.S. as
<br>a competitor in the international arms trade, with the
<br>motivation of restricting Russia's market access.
<br>Antonov said Russia respected the U.S. right to
<br>determine U.S. policy on arms sales to Venezuela, but
<br>added, "that is your decision, not ours; we have our
<br>own policy." During the U.S.-Russia MANPADS
<br>Arrangement Expert Meeting in 2006, when we raised
<br>this issue with regard to Venezuela, the GOR offered
<br>no assurances that it would not sell Igla-S to the
<br>GOV. However, it was suggested that, if a transfer
<br>occurred, the system would likely be vehicle-mounted.
<br>
<br>¶5. (U) On November 19, 2008 the Russian News 
<br>Information Agency Novosti (RIA Novosti) reported that
<br>Rosoboronexport signed a major contract for the sale
<br>of Igla-S MANPADS to Venezuela. The media report also
<br>revealed that a manager of LOMO, a partner company in
<br>the production of Igla-S, stated that this implied the
<br>contract for the delivery of several hundred Igla-S
<br>MANPADS. Copy of this media report can be found at
<br>http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20081119/118406776 -
<br>print.html.
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) At the end of January we received reports
<br>that the GOV deployed ten Venezuelan specialists to
<br>Kolomna, Russia, to begin training on the Igla-S
<br>MANPADS. Reporting indicates that five of the ten
<br>specialists are to take part in Igla-S equipment
<br>acceptance inspections, sometime in the last ten days
<br>of February 2009.
<br>
<br>OBJECTIVES
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) Post is requested to engage in a discussion on
<br>the types of weapons systems Russia is selling to
<br>Venezuela, and request details on procedures Russia
<br>believes Venezuela has in place to safely secure and
<br>safeguard these weapons systems, to better inform the
<br>new Administration as it prepares to engage Russia
<br>further on its concerns about this transaction. If
<br>the Russian Government acknowledges the transfer is
<br>imminent, Post should request the GOR to suspend the
<br>shipment until the United States and Russian
<br>Governments can discuss the matter more substantively
<br>at the appropropriate level.
<br>
<br>ACTION REQUEST
<br>
<br>¶8. (S) Post is requested to approach appropriate host
<br>government officials to discuss the potential transfer
<br>of Igla-S missile systems to Venezuela. Post may draw
<br>upon the following points:
<br>
<br>(S/REL to RUSSIA) Begin Talking Points
<br>
<br>-- The U.S. and Russia have committed to enhancing the
<br>control of MANPADS to prevent their acquisition and
<br>use by non-state actors and the proliferation to
<br>countries that do not have strong export control and
<br>stockpile management procedures.
<br>
<br>-- In this context, we would like to discuss with you
<br>the reports indicating Russia may sell the Igla-S
<br>system to Venezuela.
<br>
<br>-- We have recently seen press reports indicating that
<br>Rosoboronexport has signed a contract with the St.
<br>Petersburg-based Leningrad Optical-Mechanical
<br>Association (LOMO) for the sale of Igla-S MANPADS to
<br>Venezuela.
<br>
<br>-- As we have previously discussed, our governments
<br>have a shared concern about FARC's activities,
<br>including the acquisition of lethal military items.
<br>
<br>-- We understand there are no international
<br>restrictions on selling arms, including MANPADS, to
<br>Venezuela.
<br>
<br>-- However, we have worked together to lead efforts
<br>multilaterally to control MANPADS because of their
<br>appeal to terrorists and insurgents and their threat
<br>to civilian aircraft.
<br>
<br>-- Most recently, we reached agreement in the
<br>Wassenaar Arrangement to tighten our national
<br>controls, particularly toward end-users who are unable
<br>to protect against theft, loss, misuse, or diversion.
<br>
<br>-- This is the basis of serious U.S. concern in this
<br>possible transaction, as Venezuela's ties to the FARC
<br>represent a serious proliferation/diversion risk.
<br>
<br>-- We appreciate the frank and useful exchanges we
<br>have had on Latin America during WHA A/S Thomas
<br>Shannon's visit to Moscow and our continuing
<br>cooperation on non-proliferation and counterterrorism.
<br>
<br>-- In previous discussions on this issue, Russia has
<br>advised that it has stringent end-use requirements
<br>(consistent with the Wassenaar guidelines) for such
<br>sales and requested more specific information on why
<br>the U.S. views this possible transaction as a risk.
<br>A/S Shannon advised in his meeting that information
<br>gleaned from FARC hard-drives obtained by the
<br>Colombian government in March 2008 indicate Venezuelan
<br>government officials have tried to facilitate black
<br>and gray arms market deals for the FARC. This
<br>information was widely disseminated in major
<br>mainstream international media outlets.
<br>
<br>-- More specifically, information on the hard-drives
<br>indicated specific discussions between the Government
<br>of Venezuela and FARC on the provision of MANPADS.
<br>This highlights the basis of U.S. concerns.
<br>
<br>-- In September 2008, the U.S. Department of
<br>Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)
<br>designated two senior Venezuelan government officials,
<br>Hugo Carvajal Barrios and Henry de Jesus Rangel Silva,
<br>and one former official, Ramon Rodriguez Chacin, for
<br>materially assisting the narcotics trafficking
<br>activities of the FARC. This action was taken under
<br>the Kingpin Act. Carvajal is the director of
<br>Venezuela's military intelligence DIM); Rangel Silva
<br>is the head of civilian intelligence (DISIP). Chacin
<br>is the former interior and justice minister. He
<br>resigned September 8, 2008. (For more information, go
<br>to www.ustreas.gov/press/releases/hp1132.htm on
<br>Opennet)
<br>
<br>-- In light of Venezuela's relationship with the FARC,
<br>corruption within the Venezuelan military, and our
<br>assessment that Venezuela's stockpile and security
<br>management practices do not meet international
<br>standards, we are concerned there is a significant
<br>risk that these weapons could be diverted to the FARC.
<br>We also do not rule out the possibility that the
<br>transfer of the IGLA-S weapon system could displace
<br>and make available existing weapon systems for FARC?s
<br>use.
<br>
<br>-- Further, we fear that should these sophisticated
<br>systems fall into the hands of the FARC, they could
<br>possibly be sold or traded to drug organizations,
<br>including those in Mexico, which are actively seeking
<br>to acquire powerful and highly sophisticated weapons
<br>for use against government forces.
<br>
<br>-- The U.S. is particularly concerned about this
<br>possibility because FARC's acquisition of MANPADS
<br>would constitute a new capability for the group to
<br>undermine peace and security in the region as well as
<br>threaten counter-narcotics operations in Colombia.
<br>
<br>-- Given these serious risks, we have serious concerns
<br>about this transaction going forward. If this
<br>shipment is to be transferred imminently, we
<br>respectfully ask that your government suspend delivery
<br>of these sophisticated weapons so we may have a more
<br>substantive discussion. The United States also would
<br>welcome more details on the steps you have planned to
<br>take or assurances that you could share with us
<br>regarding Venezuela's procedures to safely secure and
<br>protect these types of weapons systems in order to
<br>prevent their proliferation or theft.
<br>End Talking Points.
