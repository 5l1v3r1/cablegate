<br>Classified By: Amb. David N. Greenlee for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: President Evo Morales' circle of Bolivian 
<br>intellectual advisers occupies half of the President's 
<br>Cabinet, including the top three positions: the Vice 
<br>President, the Minister of the Presidency, and the Minister 
<br>of Sustainable Development and Planning. While the 
<br>intellectuals have more influence over the President than his 
<br>domestic political advisers, they also compete with Cuban and 
<br>Venezuelan advisers for Morales' confidence. The second tier 
<br>of intellectual advisers is critical for implementing the 
<br>government's policies, including the Cuban-sponsored 
<br>education program, negotiating new contracts with 
<br>international hydrocarbons companies, and carrying out land 
<br>reform. This cable is part two in a three-part series on how 
<br>Morales has structured his advisory system. End summary. 
<br>
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br>First Tier of Bolivian Intellectual Advisers 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) The first tier of President Evo Morales' domestic 
<br>intellectual advisers is headed by Vice President Alvaro 
<br>Garcia Linera, followed by Minister of the Presidency Juan 
<br>Ramon Quintana and Minister of Planning Carlos Villegas. All 
<br>three were professors at the Greater University of San Andres 
<br>(UMSA) before joining the Morales administration. Morales' 
<br>intellectual advisers have more sway with the President than 
<br>do his domestic political advisers (SEPTEL), but they also 
<br>compete with Cuban and Venezuelan consultants for Morales' 
<br>confidence. They have pursued their own agenda at times, 
<br>which has angered the President in the past and could push 
<br>him to rely more on his foreign advisers if these practices 
<br>continue. 
<br>
<br>-------------------- 
<br>Alvaro Garcia Linera 
<br>-------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Vice President Alvaro Garcia Linera is the gatekeeper 
<br>for Bolivian advisers and moderates and adds intellectual 
<br>spin to the President's vision. Nonetheless, Garcia Linera 
<br>is a committed, even devout ideologue and in the past has 
<br>criticized Morales' lack of discipline to leftist ideals 
<br>(NFI). At odds with Morales on several occasions, including 
<br>disagreeing over Cabinet picks, the Vice President has 
<br>struggled to find his niche in the Morales administration and 
<br>may have found it as the MAS go-to-person for the Constituent 
<br>Assembly. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Garcia Linera, ambitious in his own right, was the 
<br>puivotal political orchestrator of the Constituent Assembly 
<br>(CA) process. Garcia Linera, who views the CA as the 
<br>ultimate forum for reforming the state, is working to build 
<br>his reputation as the expert on the issue. He was a gifted 
<br>negotiator during the congressional debate over the convoking 
<br>CA legislation. Embassy contacts say that he was key in 
<br>talking down radical proposals offered by the MAS and 
<br>opposition members, and in forging the final consensus. They 
<br>also note that he had impressive patience and focus during 
<br>the highly charged negotiations. (Comment: Some observers 
<br>say that Garcia Linera has presisdential aspirations; if so, 
<br>recent precedents suggest that the vice presidency is a good 
<br>place to be. It also suggests that he may be competing with 
<br>Morales for public support. End comment.) 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) A sharp intellectual steeped in largely discredited 
<br>political, philosophical, and economic theory, Garcia Linera 
<br>appears to see Bolivia through the prism of the French 
<br>revolution. In a recent press interview, he said that he 
<br>sees himself as the last Jacobin and Evo as Robbespierre. 
<br>(Comment: The Jacobins and Robbespierre were notorious for 
<br>their reign of terror. They arrested and executed political 
<br>
<br>LA PAZ 00000906 002 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>adversaries and allies alike and ultimately met their demise 
<br>from the same instrument used to execute the opposition: the 
<br>guillotine. To extend the analogy, many pundits have argued 
<br>that Morales may meet his own demise at the hands of 
<br>protestors, just as he was a force during protests to oust 
<br>Presidents Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and Carlos Mesa. End 
<br>comment.) 
<br>
<br>------------------- 
<br>Juan Ramon Quintana 
<br>------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Embassy contacts have said that Minister of the 
<br>Presidency Juan Ramon Quintana is responsible for 
<br>intelligence and military issues, and for coordinating 
<br>Venezuelan and Cuban support. Garcia Linera brought Quintana 
<br>into his position. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S//NF) Quintana is a disgruntled former military officer 
<br>who was fired from his position in the Ministry of Defense in 
<br>2000 during the Banzer regime. He long suspected that the US 
<br>was behind his firing, a suspicion that has some merit, and 
<br>became stridently anti-U.S. as a result. Quintana, upon 
<br>assuming his current duties, was responsible for the recent 
<br>removal of 29 flag-rank members of the armed forces, most of 
<br>whom were cooperating with the United States. The Minister 
<br>also has been seeking out other officers who have had contact 
<br>with U.S. officials, probably with the intent to fire them. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (S//NF) Quintana's disdain for the United States is so 
<br>deep that he withheld from Morales sensitive information 
<br>passed to him by U.S. intelligence agencies to prevent the 
<br>President from knowing that the Americans were helping him. 
<br>The already suspicious Morales is aware that Quintana 
<br>withheld information, and sensitive reporting indicates that 
<br>he is monitoring the Minister. Morales may choose to 
<br>sideline the Minister if the behavior continues. Sensitive 
<br>reporting also indicates that Quintana has had other problems 
<br>with Morales for paying more attention to getting jobs for 
<br>his friends than focusing on his substantive duties, 
<br>something that could further aggravate the relationship. 
<br>
<br>--------------- 
<br>Carlos Villegas 
<br>--------------- 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Minister of Planning Carlos Villegas oversees all 
<br>economic coordination and decisionmaking. The Minister of 
<br>Finance reports to Villegas, and not to Morales. Villegas, 
<br>an economics professor from UMSA, is steeped in out-dated 
<br>socialist economic theories and has yet to accept the 
<br>practical realities of a globalized economy. (REF C) 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) While Villegas may be beginning to understand the 
<br>real impact of free trade on job creation, he appears to 
<br>believe that markets in Venezuela and China serve as 
<br>alternatives to U.S. markets. He has told Bolivian exporters 
<br>to seek markets outside the United States, unconvinced that 
<br>the U.S. is crucial to their trade (REF B). He recently 
<br>returned from Venezuela after negotiating an agreement for 
<br>Venezuela to buy Bolivian soy. Additionally, he has 
<br>regularly antagonized other businesses, telling them that the 
<br>President's Dignity Tariff, a new lower price mean to provide 
<br>cheap electricity to Bolivians is a done deal, remarking that 
<br>the private sector should either get on board or suffer. 
<br>(REF A). 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
<br>Second Tier of Bolivian Intellectuals Implementing Policy 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) The second tier of intellectual advisers includes 
<br>Minister of Hydrocarbons Andres Soliz Rada, Minister of 
<br>Agriculture Hugo Salvatierra, Minister of Education Feliz 
<br>Patzi, Minister of Finance Luis Arce Catacora, and the palace 
<br>spokesman Alex Contreras. They appear to take instructions 
<br>from the top tier and from Morales himself. At times they 
<br>
<br>LA PAZ 00000906 003 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>appear more like political "operators" (SEPTEL) doing the 
<br>President's bidding. In contrast to the political operators, 
<br>however, the second tier of intellectuals does not tend to 
<br>engage in strong-arming or undermining the opposition. They 
<br>appear to focus almost exclusively on implementing 
<br>policy--including coordinating the Cuban doctors program and 
<br>pursuing land reform. (Comment: Soliz, Salvatierra, and 
<br>Patzi are all associated with UMSA.) 
<br>
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>And then there's FM Choquehuanca 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) While Foreign Minister David Choquehuanca Cespedes is 
<br>considered one of Morales' most prominent intellectuals after 
<br>Garcia Linera and Villegas, he is more of a figurehead who 
<br>represents the indigenous face of Bolivia. He appears to be 
<br>mostly hot air with no real substantive advisory role in 
<br>traditional foreign policy issues, except for possibly 
<br>maintaining contacts with European NGOs. An overly eccentric 
<br>official, who an Embassy adviser says has a sulfuric 
<br>relationship with most people, Choquehuanca's curious 
<br>statements about his ancestors living for over 200 years and 
<br>replacing milk with coca in a school nutrition program have 
<br>drawn criticisms. Morales' largely discredited arch-nemesis 
<br>Felipe Quispe Huanca has been a vocal supporter of the 
<br>Minister, which only adds to Choquehuanca's trivial role. 
<br>Indeed, Choquehuanca appears to have been only marginally 
<br>involved in Bolivia's key foreign policy issues to date.
