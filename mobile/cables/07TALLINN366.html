<br>
<br>¶1. (S) Summary. Since April 27, Estonia has been the 
<br>victim of the world's first coordinated cyber attacks 
<br>against a nation state and its political and economic 
<br>infrastructure. The sensational nature of the story, 
<br>combined with the highly technical details of the subject 
<br>matter, has led to a good deal of misinformation in the 
<br>public domain. Although GOE and international analysis 
<br>is ongoing, these attacks have highlighted the 
<br>vulnerability of both government and private sector 
<br>internet infrastructure to attacks of this nature. For 
<br>over a month, government, banking, media, and other 
<br>Estonian websites, servers, and routers came under a 
<br>barrage of cyber attacks. Defense against the attacks 
<br>was extremely expensive for both GOE and the private 
<br>sector. GOE and private cyber defense experts cite the 
<br>nature and sophistication of the attacks as proof of 
<br>Russian government complicity in the attacks. End 
<br>Summary. 
<br>
<br>Virtual Shots Heard Round the World 
<br>----------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Cyber attacks against Estonian websites began on 
<br>April 27. They came in the wake of rioting in Tallinn 
<br>triggered by the Government of Estonia's (GOE) 
<br>preparations for relocating the so called "Bronze 
<br>Soldier", a Soviet-era World War II monument (Refs A and 
<br>B). The attacks initially targeted GOE websites 
<br>including those of the Estonian President, Prime 
<br>Minister, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), Ministry of 
<br>Justice (MOJ), and Parliament, among others. According 
<br>to XXXXXXXXXXXX the initial attacks were 
<br>technically unsophisticated and "seemed more like a cyber 
<br>riot than a cyber war." However, all our Estonian 
<br>interlocutors clearly recognized these attacks as 
<br>political in nature. Russian-language internet chat 
<br>forums held discussions exhorting people to attack 
<br>Estonian sites and supplied downloadable software tools 
<br>to carry out the attacks. According to XXXXXXXXXXXX, these 
<br>initial attacks were limited to spam (a barrage of 
<br>unsolicited emails) and cyber vandalism (e.g., Prime 
<br>Minister Andrus Ansip's photo was defaced on the Estonian 
<br>Reform Party's website) and appeared to be nothing more 
<br>than a virtual mob reaction to the Bronze Soldier issue. 
<br>Estonian media and press commentators were quick to 
<br>accuse Moscow of being responsible, interpreting these 
<br>attacks as part of Russian retribution for moving the 
<br>Bronze Soldier (Ref C). 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) However, on April 30, a broader range of cyber 
<br>attacks -- from simple spam postings to coordinated DDoS 
<br>(Distributed Denial-of-Service) attacks -- began against 
<br>GOE sites. (Note. A DDoS attack is when a flood of 
<br>bogus queries are made to a specific server or network of 
<br>computers in order to over-saturate the target and 
<br>prevent access by legitimate users. End Note.) For 
<br>example, the Presidential website, which normally has a 2 
<br>million Mbps (megabits per second) capacity, was flooded 
<br>with nearly 200 million Mbps of traffic. While none of 
<br>the technology involved in the attacks was new, tactics 
<br>and tools routinely shifted to prevent Estonian 
<br>authorities from blocking the attacks. One of the most 
<br>pernicious tools in these attacks was "bots." (Note. 
<br>Bots are computers and/or servers under the control of a 
<br>third party. End Note.) These bot attacks came from 
<br>ISPs (internet service providers) around the world (e.g., 
<br>the United States, Canada, Russia, Turkey, Germany, 
<br>Belgium, Egypt, Vietnam, etc.). Attacks routinely came 
<br>from one set of bots, subsided and then resumed again 
<br>using another set of bots with different ISPs. According 
<br>to XXXXXXXXXXXX, the attacks ranged from a single
<br>minute to  many hours in length. The longest attacks lasted
<br>
<br>
<br>TALLINN 00000366 002 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>over  ten hours and unleashed a crushing 90 million Mbps of 
<br>traffic on targeted endpoints. According to XXXXXXXXXXXX,
<br>the GOE's  assessment was that a small but unknown number
<br>of  individuals were behind these more sophisticated cyber 
<br>attacks, which quickly dwarfed the traffic volume of the 
<br>initial cyber rioters. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) On May 3, the cyber attacks expanded beyond GOE 
<br>sites and servers to private sites. Hansabank and SEB, 
<br>Estonia's two largest banks, faced the most significant 
<br>problems. Swedish-owned Hansabank and SEB account for 
<br>almost 75% of all online banking in Estonia. (Note: 
<br>Approximately 90% of all money transfers and bill 
<br>payments in Estonia are done online. End Note.) 
<br>Hansabank was well prepared with powerful servers, 
<br>alternate sites to mirror content (thus making it more 
<br>difficult for DDoS attacks), and the ability to 
<br>reallocate access lines from foreign to domestic 
<br>customers. However, even though Hansabank's site 
<br>remained online, XXXXXXXXXXXX estimated that it came
<br>at a cost -  - at least 10 million Euros ($13.4 million)
<br> Hansabank  also had to temporarily block access to its site by all 
<br>foreign ISPs so that there was enough broadband capacity 
<br>for its domestic clients. However, Hansabank was able to 
<br>create alternate access mechanisms for its largest 
<br>foreign customers. Correcting much of the press coverage 
<br>in the early days of the attacks, XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br> said that  while the cyber attacks against Hansabank and SEB were a 
<br>challenge, there was no serious danger of Estonia's 
<br>banking sector being shut down. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) This second wave of cyber attacks also hit the 
<br>websites of Postimees, Estonia's paper of record, and 
<br>Eesti Paevaleht, a leading Estonian-language daily, which 
<br>over two-thirds of Estonians regularly visit for their 
<br>news. "Imagine if you can the psychological effect," 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX asked us, "when an Estonian tries to
<br>pay his bills but can't or get the news online but can't." As 
<br>one of the most wired countries on the planet, GOE 
<br>interlocutors viewed the evolution of the attacks as a 
<br>frightening threat to key economic and societal 
<br>infrastructure. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S) The attacks reached their apex on May 9, the 
<br>Russian anniversary of the end of World War II. To cope 
<br>with the rising volume of attacks, the GOE increased its 
<br>broadband capacity from two Gbps (Gigabites per second) 
<br>to eight Gbps. Hansabank, SEB, Postimees, and others 
<br>also added servers to increase broadband capacity. A 
<br>EUCOM cyber defense expert described it as a "cyber arms 
<br>race" where the Estonians repeatedly increased their 
<br>broadband capacity to match the increasing volume of 
<br>cyber attacks (Ref D). XXXXXXXXXXXX told us that XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>increased the  "broadband pipe" for both government and private 
<br>clients  at a frantic pace to keep up with the attacks.
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX  told us that one GOE ministry increased
<br>its original  server capacity of 30 Mbps to 1 Gbps (1 Gbps
<br>equals 1000  Mbps). XXXXXXXXXXXX said that this defensive
<br>response by  the GOE and the private sector was ultimately
<br>successful,  but it was extremely expensive. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) The number of attacks steadily declined after May 
<br>9 and 10, allowing GOE and private sites to reduce their 
<br>broadband capacity. However, on May 15, there was an 
<br>unexpected spike in attacks that focused on Hansabank and 
<br>SEB. In two separate and coordinated 15 minute attacks, 
<br>these two sites were hit with over 400 bot attacks 
<br>(roughly half the number of bot attacks recorded on May 
<br>10) from multiple ISPs. The attacks temporarily crashed 
<br>SEB's site for 30 minutes. Since the May 15 spike, the 
<br>number of attacks has declined and is now hovering 
<br>slightly above pre-April 27 numbers. 
<br>
<br>
<br>No Smoking Gun 
<br>
<br>TALLINN 00000366 003 OF 004 
<br>¶8. (S) On May 2, Foreign Minister Urmas Paet released a 
<br>statement that the MFA had proof that some of the attacks 
<br>originated from GOR ISPs. The Estonian and international 
<br>press carried Paet's claim, but  XXXXXXXXXXXX interlocutors 
<br>distanced themselves from the accusation. 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX  privately said to us that no "smoking gun"
<br>incriminating  Moscow has turned up and likely won't.
<br>The use of bots,  proxies, and spoofing tactics makes it
<br>extremely  difficult to determine with any certainty the origin 
<br>of  the attacks. Press reports suggested that a million 
<br>computers were involved in the attacks. However, 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX admitted that due to Estonia's poor
<br>monitoring  capability, XXXXXXXXXXXX could only speculate on the
<br>number of computers and servers attacking Estonia, and had
<br>even less specific information on the origins of the attacks. 
<br>(Note. XXXXXXXXXXXX said that the one million figure
<br> used by  the press and the GOE was from a quote to the press
<br>taken out of context in which he tried to explain how he could 
<br>only speculate a number ranging from a 1000 to a million 
<br>computers. End Note.) 
<br>
<br>¶9. (S) The GOE believes it has enough circumstantial 
<br>evidence to link Moscow with the attacks. As President 
<br>Ilves told the Ambassador, renting the large number of 
<br>bots used in these attacks is an expensive business. 
<br>Moreover, as XXXXXXXXXXXX repeatedly asked us in 
<br>conversations, "Who benefits from these attacks?" He 
<br>speculated that the probing nature of the attacks on 
<br>specific government and strategic private sector targets 
<br>through the use of anonymous proxies fit the modus 
<br>operandi of the Putin regime testing a new "weapon." 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXXX told us that the GOE now feels that their original 
<br>assessment of a "cyber riot" may have been incorrect. 
<br>"Looking at the patterns of the attacks, it is clear that 
<br>there was a small, core of individuals who intended to 
<br>launch their attack on May 9," XXXXXXXXXXXX explained, "but 
<br>when the MOD announced its plans to move the Bronze 
<br>Soldier on April 27, they moved up their plans to try to 
<br>link the attacks with the monument's removal." Estonian 
<br>analysis of these later sophisticated attacks and 
<br>organization through Russian-language internet forums has 
<br>led them to believe that the key individuals tried to 
<br>disguise their initial attacks as a cyber riot. "You 
<br>don't expect spontaneous, populist cyber attacks to have 
<br>a pre-determined list of targets and precise dates and 
<br>times for coordinated attacks," said XXXXXXXXXXX. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (S) GOE interlocutors expressed their frustration 
<br>that their requests for information from the GOR or 
<br>action on Russian-based ISP attacks were not answered or 
<br>acted upon. XXXXXXXXXXX complained that cooperation
<br>with  Russia's CERT was almost nonexistent. Even at the height 
<br>of the Bronze Soldier controversy, GOE interlocutors who 
<br>regularly work with their Russian counterparts (e.g., law 
<br>enforcement, customs and tax, border guards, etc.) tell 
<br>us that working level cooperation was positive. In 
<br>comparison, the lack of responsiveness by the GOR and 
<br>Russian CERT personnel only diminished Russia's claims of 
<br>innocence in the eyes of the Estonians. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (S) On May 29, Konstantin Koloskokov, Commissar of 
<br>the pro-Kremlin youth group Nashi in Transnistria, 
<br>claimed responsibility for some of the early cyber 
<br>attacks. While not discounting the possibility of his 
<br>involvement, XXXXXXXXXXXX noted that some of the
<br>attacks were  extremely sophisticated; beyond the technical
<br>abilities  of an amateur. To illustrate the point, XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br> and  XXXXXXXXXXXX described an attack that used a mysterious
<br>data  packet to crash a GOE and Elion router so quickly that 
<br>the Estonians are still uncertain how it was done. 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX described in detail a number of
<br>additional  attacks using different tools and techniques
<br>and targets  to argue that an organized group with deep
<br>financial backing was the likeliest culprit. "Koloskokov is
<br>window  dressing," said XXXXXXXXXXXX, "a convenient
<br>set-up by the  real perpetrators."
