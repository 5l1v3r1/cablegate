<br>------
<br>Summary
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) That Russia is "back," at least economically, has been
<br>an insistent theme of the Kremlin the last few years.
<br>Russia's economic recovery from the depths of its financial
<br>crash in 1998 is indeed impressive. High growth, burgeoning
<br>international reserves, and rising living standards were the
<br>result of luck in the form of a five-fold increase in the
<br>prices of oil and gas, Russia's main exports, but also the
<br>result of prudent macroeconomic policies that stressed fiscal
<br>and monetary stability.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) We would argue, however that the Russian government
<br>has overstated the extent of this economic restoration and
<br>its sustainability. After seven years of 7 percent growth or
<br>better, per capita income remains below $10,000 a year and
<br>only last year did Russia's GDP finally surpass its level in
<br>¶1991. Moreover, unlike other emerging markets such as China
<br>and India, Russia's impressive growth has not been fueled by
<br>its manufacturing sector but rather by rising but volatile
<br>commodity prices.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) The underlying fragility of the Russian economy and
<br>its uncertain future have been brought into sharp focus by
<br>the war in Georgia. Some of our contacts agree with the line
<br>from the Russian government, that the economy will quickly
<br>recover from its current turmoil. Other observers believe
<br>that higher political risk has returned for the foreseeable
<br>future -- bringing with it lower economic growth. However,
<br>all of our contacts are increasingly pessimistic about the
<br>ability of the GOR to pursue the reforms needed to modernize
<br>and diversify the Russian economy.
<br>
<br>----------------
<br>Short Term Costs
<br>----------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) One of the persistent myths that Russian government
<br>officials press publicly about the Russian economy is that it
<br>is "decoupled" from the global financial system, by which
<br>these officials mean its growth and stability are not
<br>affected by global developments and specifically are immune
<br>to the effects of the sub-prime crisis in the United States.
<br>A corollary of this argument is that Russia is a "safehaven"
<br>for international investors. However, the performance of
<br>Russia's stock markets over the past two months and
<br>especially since the war with Georgia erupted belies these
<br>claims.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) As we have reported elsewhere, the Russian stock
<br>market began its slide in mid-May. Global conditions -- a
<br>strengthening dollar and softening demand for commodities -)
<br>were contributing factors. However, a series of government
<br>actions culminating in the decision to invade Georgia and
<br>recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia's independence are
<br>principal causes that have driven the stock markets to their
<br>lowest levels in nearly two years, in the process wiping out
<br>hundreds of billions of dollars in shareholder value.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) With military activities subsiding, local newspapers
<br>have been increasingly filled this past week with articles
<br>about the economic cost of the war and its aftermath for
<br>Russia, citing especially the stock market losses and the
<br>downturn in business confidence. The Kremlin has seemed
<br>oblivious to these concerns, claiming that the economy is
<br>fundamentally strong and will quickly recover. Some local
<br>analysts agree, citing in particular Russia's status as the
<br>world's largest exporter of hydrocarbons. Chris Weafer of
<br>Uralsib noted in an August 27 e-mail to clients that Russia
<br>has $1 billion in oil and gas revenue coming in each day and
<br>tensions with the West, including possible sanctions, will
<br>not affect this.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) However, other analysts are less sanguine. xxxxx told us that the decline in the
<br>stock market is "how the business community gets to vote
<br>about the government's economic policies." He said foreign
<br>and Russian investors' bet on the Russian economy is on its
<br>"convergence" with Western economies. With that now in
<br>question, he and other analysts see the return of "high
<br>political risk" to the Russian economy and worry that it may
<br>be permanent. Although they don't see a 1998-style collapse
<br>
<br>coming, they do see lower growth over time. In fact, most
<br>analysts have been systematically cutting their forecasts for
<br>2008 growth over the past two weeks.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) The effect of the global credit crunch has been
<br>magnified by increased political risk in Russia, further
<br>raising the cost of capital. More expensive capital will
<br>cause Russian and foreign businesses here to delay or cancel
<br>expansion and improvement plans, lowering growth. The
<br>Russian economy is particularly vulnerable in this regard
<br>because it is heavily reliant on foreign capital for its
<br>long-term financing needs. Russian corporations reportedly
<br>have $500 billion in increasingly expensive short-term
<br>foreign debt.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) According to xxxxx lower growth in turn ultimately
<br>puts at risk the grand bargain the GOR has made with the
<br>Russian people -) rising living standards in return for
<br>political quiescence. He believes, as do many of our other
<br>contacts, that a likely outcome is that the GOR will
<br>intervene and recapitalize Russian companies in place of the
<br>expensive foreign loans. Norilsk Nickel's Vladimir Potanin
<br>had a highly publicized meeting last week with Medvedev in
<br>which he reportedly asked for this. While xxxxx thought
<br>this might spark a market rally and ease the short-term costs
<br>to the Russian economy, he acknowledged that the long-term
<br>economic consequences would be negative.
<br>
<br>----------------------
<br>Long Term Consequences
<br>----------------------
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) A second myth about Russia's economy is that it has
<br>been moving beyond dependence on exports of natural resources
<br>and that its current prosperity is now driven by a
<br>self-perpetuating growth in consumer spending. In fact, the
<br>boom is threatening to go bust. Inflation has risen rapidly
<br>over the past year, exposing the underlying disconnect
<br>between supply and demand in the economy. Simply put, the
<br>energy bonanza has fueled sharply increased domestic demand
<br>and in the absence of an adequate supply response, prices
<br>have soared.
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) The GOR explicitly acknowledged that economic growth
<br>was off kilter in the run-up to the presidential election in
<br>March. President Medvedev made a series of statements, the
<br>most famous his February "four I's" speech at the Krasnoyarsk
<br>Economic Forum, at which he called for fundamental reforms to
<br>the Russian economy, including: strengthening institutions,
<br>improving infrastructure, moving to a value added
<br>"innovation" economy, and improving the climate for
<br>investment. The net result, according to Medvedev and his
<br>inner circle, would be a more modern and more competitive
<br>economy.
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Medvedev's agenda appears to be one of the casualties
<br>of the war in Georgia. There was already entrenched
<br>opposition to the reforms within the ruling elite, and
<br>especially to Medvedev's emphasis on fighting official
<br>corruption and reducing state control. Much to the dismay of
<br>the majority of the business community, Medvedev's apparent
<br>loss of influence (reftel) would seem to put paid to the
<br>reforms, at least for the time being. It has also raised two
<br>very important questions: who is in charge of Russian
<br>economic policy and what are their objectives?
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) The easy answers in the wake of the Georgian conflict
<br>would be Vladimir Putin and that his goal is maximizing the
<br>economic power of the state. However, it is more complicated
<br>than that. There are three primary economic tendencies or
<br>groups that are discernible within the Russian government
<br>elite. All of them enjoy some degree of support from the
<br>"tandemocracy," and all of them have influence and shape
<br>policies.
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) Two of these groups are generally characterized as
<br>economic "liberals" who favor market solutions: one group
<br>centered on Finance Minister Aleksey Kudrin and the other on
<br>President Medvedev in the person of his principal economic
<br>advisor, Arkadiy Dvorkovich. For Kudrin's group, which
<br>includes his Finance Ministry and the Central Bank, the
<br>watchword is stability. They favor more moderate growth and
<br>more gradual reforms. Dvorkovich's group, which includes the
<br>Presidential Administration and most of the Ministry of
<br>Economic Development, favors faster growth and faster
<br>reforms.
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) These two groups probably agree on more issues than
<br>
<br>they disagree on, especially on the need for the
<br>modernization, integration and diversification of the economy
<br>encapsulated in Medvedev's reform agenda. However, a month
<br>ago it was their disagreements over inflation and taxes that
<br>were driving economic policy. Kudrin thought the economy was
<br>overheating and wanted to slow growth and rededicate the GOR
<br>to fiscal discipline. Dvorkovich argued for lower taxes to
<br>stimulate even faster growth which, when combined with
<br>structural reforms and infrastructure investments, would
<br>unleash the supply response he thought was needed to restore
<br>equilibrium to the economy.
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) The result of the competition between these two
<br>groups seemed to be a healthy debate within the GOR that was
<br>likely to lead to a set of compromise economic policies that
<br>would have promoted Medvedev's reforms while emphasizing
<br>continued stability. xxxxx that the
<br>government's policies could be summed up as: legal reform,
<br>leading to reduced corruption, leading to increased economic
<br>freedom, leading to a surge in small and medium sized
<br>enterprises, leading to faster and better economic growth,
<br>the benefits of which would be more widely and evenly
<br>distributed.
<br>
<br>¶17. (C) However, the third group within the governing elite
<br>that has a great deal of sway over economic policies -- the
<br>so-called "siloviki" -- has very different goals. They are
<br>not easily identifiable as a group and have no natural leader
<br>on a par with Kudrin, since their members are driven
<br>primarily by self-interest. They do, however, share two
<br>overarching characteristics: a preference for state control
<br>and a high tolerance for official corruption. They are often
<br>closely linked or overlap with another amorphous group, the
<br>"oligarchs," Russia's fabulously rich billionaires, most of
<br>whom made their money out of political connections, are loath
<br>to challenge the government in the wake of the Yukos affair,
<br>and an increasing percentage of whom, like Deputy Prime
<br>Minister Sechin or the head of state corporation
<br>Rostechnologia, Sergey Chemezov, have backgrounds in the
<br>security services.
<br>
<br>¶18. (C) The siloviki are by all accounts the big winners out
<br>of recent events. There were reports that Medvedev was
<br>planning to move many of them aside in a fall government
<br>reshuffle. If such plans existed, they are now shelved. The
<br>siloviki are also the main opponents of modernization and
<br>integration, which would have limited their ability to
<br>extract rent from the economy. These individuals are now
<br>more likely to succeed in arguing for continuing state
<br>control, and therefore their control, over the commanding
<br>heights of the economy, especially the energy sector -- where
<br>the profits are high and the profit margins even higher.
<br>
<br>¶19. (C) The Kremlin's consistent rejection of the economic
<br>consequences of its action, whether over the TNK-BP investor
<br>dispute, the Mechel incident, or the conflict with Georgia,
<br>has played into the siloviki's hands, reinforcing their
<br>authority and their ability to delay reforms. That said, the
<br>weakness of the siloviki's position, according to xxxxx and
<br>others, is that the long-term uncertainty about the GOR's
<br>commitment to market economics and international integration
<br>) to playing by the rules at home and abroad ) will
<br>inevitably reduce the economic resources at the government's
<br>disposal and that in turn will put their two principal
<br>objectives, personal enrichment and continued control of the
<br>country, in direct competition.
<br>
<br>-------
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶20. (C) There are two economic futures for Russia. The first
<br>is the one that Medvedev and the economic liberals have
<br>sketched out in the government's ambitious "2020" development
<br>plan. This future is that of an "innovation" economy that
<br>has diversified away from a reliance on commodity exports
<br>toward industries where Russia can add value. In this
<br>economic future, Russia's enormous revenues from oil and gas
<br>would have been used to transform and modernize the economy.
<br>60 percent of Russians would be "middle class" providing a
<br>lasting force for political and economic stability. This
<br>future seemed poised to emerge as a central government
<br>priority just a few months ago; now it is clearly on a back
<br>burner.
<br>
<br>¶21. (C) The darker future is one all too familiar to many
<br>countries that are blessed with natural resources and cursed
<br>with poor governance. It is a Russia still dependent on
<br>
<br>volatile commodity exports, the surplus of which is easily
<br>captured by an entrenched and self-interested governing
<br>elite. It is a country of income extremes and unstable
<br>politics. And it is a country that, with its resources being
<br>rapidly depleted or with the world moving toward other energy
<br>sources, may have missed its chance at lasting prosperity.
<br>
<br>¶22. (C) Both of these futures pose opportunities and threats
<br>for the U.S. A prosperous, more self-confident Russia is one
<br>that will require the intensive engagement and policy
<br>give-and-take that characterizes our relations with our
<br>European allies. It is less likely to be a Russia that
<br>threatens its neighbors and fears their stability and
<br>prosperity. A Russia still dependent on commodity exports
<br>will likely be intrinsically weaker and less influential
<br>globally, but lacking domestic accountability, it will pose
<br>more of threat to its neighbors and therefore to
<br>international order.
<br>
<br>¶23. (C) Without doubt, the U.S. has a clear interest in the
<br>first future: for a more prosperous, better integrated, more
<br>stable Russia. With that in mind, we would argue that the
<br>U.S. needs to be careful that our efforts to demonstrate that
<br>Russia's actions vis-a-vis Georgia have real consequences do
<br>not play into the hands of the anti-reform circles who are
<br>promoting that other future.
<br>
<br>¶24. (C) The Russians of course, especially the progressives
<br>around Medvedev, also face a difficult choice. Medvedev's
<br>recent public statements, especially the harsh rhetoric that
<br>Russia has nothing to fear from economic isolation, are
<br>contradicted by privately-expressed hopes that we not take
<br>steps to isolate them. They will ultimately have to decide
<br>when and how to confront their domestic opponents if they are
<br>to avoid this fate and if they are to resume their efforts to
<br>transform Russia's economy.
