<br>¶1. Summary: (C) IO DAS-Equivalent Beatrice Le Fraper du 
<br>Hellen on April 7 regretted that the Human Rights Council 
<br>(HRC) would be a less credible institution without USG 
<br>participation. However, she admitted that she herself had 
<br>urged the MFA not to seek an HRC seat in 2006, but to wait 
<br>until 2007 when members would be elected for full three-year 
<br>terms. With the U.S. absent, Le Fraper urged regular 
<br>French-U.S. dialogue so that USG equities could be taken into 
<br>account. She warned that the EU may put forward a 
<br>Guantanamo-related resolution, but suggested that the EU had 
<br>learned lessons from the fracas over renditions at the 
<br>Council of Europe. Le Fraper lauded the U.S. aim to 
<br>encourage the HRC to address the worst human rights abusing 
<br>nations, including Iran. She suggested that France had lost 
<br>patience with Zimbabwe in the domain of human rights, 
<br>although the French UN delegation in New York chafed at any 
<br>confrontation with the Africa Group. Lastly, Le Fraper 
<br>mentioned that France and Argentina would roll out a draft 
<br>convention on enforced disappearances at the HRC. End 
<br>Summary. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) IO DAS-Equivalent Beatrice Le Fraper du Hellen on 
<br>April 7 regretted that the Human Rights Council would be a 
<br>less credible institution without USG participation (ref). 
<br>She tempered her disappointment however with the observation 
<br>that she had likewise argued -- but without success -- that 
<br>France not seek an HRC seat in 2006. From a tactical 
<br>standpoint, it was smarter to hold off until 2007 in order to 
<br>obtain a guaranteed a full 3-year term on the Council. 
<br>Candidates this year, she explained to Poloff, were competing 
<br>for 1-year, 2-year or 3-year terms on the newly launched HRC; 
<br>in future, terms would run for three years. Le Fraper 
<br>bemoaned that France now had to launch a worldwide diplomatic 
<br>campaign for a seat without knowing in advance the length of 
<br>the term it would be alloted on the Council, which would be 
<br>determined later by lottery. Le Fraper asked for USG support 
<br>for the French candidacy. Le Fraper believed that the USG 
<br>would have at least as much influence as actual seated HRC 
<br>members on debates about establishing standard HRC procedures 
<br>during the inaugural year, because that policy would be 
<br>articulated through regional groups. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) With the U.S. absent from the HRC, Le Fraper urged 
<br>regular French-U.S. dialogue so that USG equities could be 
<br>taken into account. She noted the French and American 
<br>Geneva-based delegations enjoyed good relations. Regular 
<br>consulatations were crucial, especially given the possibility 
<br>that some EU member would lobby to advance a resolution on 
<br>Guantanamo detainees. However, Le Fraper believed the fracas 
<br>over renditions at the Council of Europe had been salutary, 
<br>if only for cautioning EU members that they should tread 
<br>lightly, since European governments lacked full awareness of 
<br>what transpired on their own territory, whether with or 
<br>without direct government complicity. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Le Fraper lauded the USG aim to actively encourage 
<br>the HRC to address serious cases of human rights abuse in 
<br>countries such as Iran, Cuba, Zimbabwe, Burma, Sudan and 
<br>South Korea. FM Douste-Blazy was now particularly exercised 
<br>about Iran, she said. Moreover, France had lost patience 
<br>with Zimbabwe, Le Fraper insisted, pointing to French support 
<br>for a human rights-related UNGA resolution, a policy 
<br>decision, she added, that had vexed the French delegation in 
<br>New York, which had preferred not to roil the waters with the 
<br>Africa Group. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Le Fraper forewarned that France and Argentina would 
<br>be introducing a new draft legal convention about enforced 
<br>disappearances at the HRC. She regretted that the USG would 
<br>not be present at the Council for discussions, but Argentina 
<br>in particular was keen on rolling out the draft this year, 
<br>which marks the 30th anniversary of the launching of the 
<br>so-called "Dirty War." The draft would also be presented at 
<br>the General Assembly. French involvement in the initiative 
<br>dated to 1978, after the disappearance of French citizens in 
<br>Argentina. Le Fraper commented she knew of U.S. 
<br>sensitivities about possible ramifications in the context of 
<br>the detention of non-state actors. The Government of 
<br>Colombia, Fraper added, had also had expressed concerns, yet 
<br>now appeared ready to support the draft. (Note: Human Rights 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00002358 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>Desk Officer Donatienne Hissard clarified on April 10 that 
<br>the U.S. had joined consensus on negotiations of the 
<br>convention while nonetheless expressing reserves about the 
<br>"Right to Truth," e.g. the rights of victims to information 
<br>about the circumstances of their detention, as well as other 
<br>rights for detainees.) 
<br>
<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Comment and BioNote: Le Fraper clearly sees the USG 
<br>as an indispensable player in the advocacy of human rights. 
<br>While worrying the HRC would lack weight without USG 
<br>membership, Le Fraper otherwise discounted the impact of USG 
<br>non-participation, apart from advising there would be a need 
<br>to consult closely in order to take USG equities into 
<br>account. Le Fraper said the MFA made an effort to avoid 
<br>dramatization of the U.S. decision in exchanges with the 
<br>press and with NGOs. Bionote: Le Fraper mentioned that her 
<br>sister, Dorothe Le Fraper du Hellen, was also a dedicated 
<br>human rights advocate, and a lawyer on the defense teams of 
<br>both Jose Bove and Zacarias Moussaoui. Le Fraper mentioned 
<br>she had just accompanied her sister to the U.S. consulate to 
<br>apply for an expedited visa so that she could make an 
<br>emergency trip to the trial. Le Fraper mentioned that MFA, 
<br>especially MFA spokesman Mattei, has been taking great pains 
<br>to work hand in glove with the USG with regard to the 
<br>Moussaoui trial.
