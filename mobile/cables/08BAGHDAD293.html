<br>
<br>REF: 08 JAN 08 BAGHDAD O/I (SELF-PROCLAIMED SISTANI 
<br>EMISSARIES) 
<br>
<br>BAGHDAD 00000293 001.2 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>Classified By: Political Counselor Matt Tueller for reasons 1.4 (b) and 
<br>(d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Scion of a prominent Najafi clerical family 
<br>and related to both Grand Ayatollah Sistani and Moqtada 
<br>al-Sadr, Emad Klanter told us January 30 that bumbling Iraqi 
<br>politicians fail to make progress of any sort but actively 
<br>encourage a public perception of "American Occupation" 
<br>through statements to vernacular media. He predicted Sadr 
<br>would extend his JAM militia freeze order beyond February, 
<br>and advised that we can change the "backward" Sadrists and 
<br>contain their movement but only if we adopt a more balanced 
<br>approach to their arch-enemy ISCI. Klanter pleaded for USG 
<br>pressure on the GOI and political blocs to hold early 
<br>provincial elections under an "open list" system, adding that 
<br>no one but the Sadrists and Sistani are eager for elections. 
<br>He claimed that his maternal uncle Sistani is alarmed by the 
<br>degree of Iranian penetration in Iraq and is frustrated by 
<br>his lack of indirect contact with the USG. Klanter warned 
<br>that only Sistani and the Marja'iyyah can stand up to Iran 
<br>and Shia extremism, adding that if the USG does not 
<br>strengthen Sistani, "Iran will devour Iraq." End Summary. 
<br>
<br>"Our Brains Are In Our Eyes" 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Son of a respected Najafi Ayatollah, nephew to Grand 
<br>Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, related by marriage to Muqtada 
<br>al-Sadr, and bearing a faint resemblance to the actor Robert 
<br>De Niro, Klanter is a direct descendant of the Prophet 
<br>Muhammad but was not wearing the traditional Shia Sayyid's 
<br>garb of black turban and cloak during our meeting at the IZ 
<br>villa of Saad Jabr, a Saddam-era exile opposition financier 
<br>and son of Iraq's first Shia Prime Minister. Claiming he had 
<br>recently met with Prime Minister Maliki, Klanter bemoaned the 
<br>ineffectuality of Iraq's political leaders and warned that 
<br>the gap between these leaders and the Iraqi people is growing 
<br>wider by the day. He stated that while Maliki might be able 
<br>to entice Iraqiyyah and Tawafuq to rejoin his government, 
<br>neither ISCI nor the Kurds want anything beyond superficial 
<br>changes to the status quo. When we informed him that USG 
<br>patience is wearing thin with the pace of Iraqi political 
<br>process, Klanter appeared incredulous that the U.S. would 
<br>even consider scaling-down in Iraq "because you destroyed a 
<br>regime and now you bear the responsibility to build up a 
<br>replacement. If you leave there is a 100 percent certainty 
<br>of civil war, which might happen anyway even if you don't 
<br>leave." Swinging his arms into an abbreviated "Gator Chomp" 
<br>type of gesture, he said that if the U.S, leaves "Iran will 
<br>swallow us whole." 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Small wonder that the Iraqi people feel as though they 
<br>are living under "American Occupation," Klanter maintained, 
<br>because Iraqi politicians - Shia, Sunni, and Kurds alike - 
<br>routinely use terms like "occupation" and "occupiers" when 
<br>referring to the USG presence in Iraq during interviews with 
<br>local media. The forty-something Shia cleric, who told us he 
<br>teaches religious classes in Najaf's traditional Shia 
<br>seminary (Hawzah) and also operates a media-oriented NGO, 
<br>defied us to name one Iraqi politician who has ever referred 
<br>to Americans as "friends" in local or Pan-Arab media. When 
<br>Iraqi politicians talk to Sistani and the Marja'iyyah, he 
<br>continued, "they blame you for all of Iraq's problems, even 
<br>their own failure to deliver public services." He chided the 
<br>USG for dealing exclusively with Iraq's political class and 
<br>ignoring contact with the Iraqi people. Employing an Iraqi 
<br>proverb that says "our brains are in our eyes", Klanter 
<br>exclaimed that Iraqis find it almost impossible to believe 
<br>news reports that the USG has spent billions of dollars in 
<br>Iraq "since we don't see any buildings or hospitals or 
<br>structures that you have built here." He chuckled softly 
<br>when we replied that the important thing is for the Iraqi 
<br>people to see the GOI constructing buildings and other 
<br>structures for their benefit. 
<br>
<br>Sadrist Insights and Elections 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Klanter, whose two brothers are reportedly married to 
<br>sisters of Moqtada al-Sadr and who claims to maintain good 
<br>relations with many senior Sadrists, said that Sadr will most 
<br>likely extend the freeze on his Jaysh al-Mehdi militia beyond 
<br>its scheduled expiration at the end of February. 
<br>Characterizing the education level and mentality of most 
<br>Sadrists as "backward, almost like they are from a cave," 
<br>Klanter told us the USG can contain such people and change 
<br>their thinking by "sending them to the U.S. and exposing them 
<br>to new ideas." In reply to our rejoinder that we seek 
<br>cordial relations with Sadrists who wish to participate 
<br>
<br>BAGHDAD 00000293 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>peacefully in Iraq's democratic future, Klanter replied that 
<br>"they hear you say this but then they look at your unbalanced 
<br>relationship with ISCI and they don't believe your words." 
<br>Klanter added gratuitously that, in his opinion, ISCI is more 
<br>dangerous than the Sadrists because it is fronting for Iran. 
<br>Conceding that some part of Sadr's movement is allied with 
<br>Iran, he said Moqtada remains popular because "even though he 
<br>is in Iran, we hear that he is constantly quarreling with the 
<br>Iranians." Jabr chimed in that the USG has unwittingly 
<br>driven Sadr into Tehran's arms. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Klanter pleaded for USG pressure on the GOI and 
<br>political blocs to hold early provincial elections: such 
<br>pressure will be needed, he claimed, since no one but the 
<br>Sadrists and Grand Ayatollah Sistani are eager for elections. 
<br>Characterizing the 2005 "closed list" electoral system as a 
<br>failure, Klanter also urged us to push for an "open list" 
<br>system. He said the Sadrists can live with either an open or 
<br>closed list system "because they know they have a very loyal 
<br>base of popular support and they realize they will not be 
<br>able to attract other voters beyond that base." "Even though 
<br>I am a man of religion," Klanter asserted, "I don't support 
<br>religious political parties because they have been shown to 
<br>be a complete failure in Iraq and in Iran." 
<br>
<br>Frustrated Sistani Wants More Indirect USG Contact 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Repeating many of the points he made during a January 
<br>8 meeting and which he claimed were conveyed to him directly 
<br>by Sistani (Ref A), Klanter said Sistani's greatest fear is 
<br>the degree of Iranian penetration in Iraq. He claimed that 
<br>Sistani is in possession of detailed Iranian plans to 
<br>dominate Iraq's political, economic, and religious 
<br>institutions. Klanter added that Sistani wants to know what 
<br>the USG is planning to do about this (we note that we have 
<br>heard unsubstantiated reports that Klanter may have ties to 
<br>Iranian intelligence and is held at something like arm's 
<br>length by his maternal uncle Sistani). He said Sistani is 
<br>now more open to indirect contact with the USG than ever 
<br>before and is frustrated that previous emissaries were not 
<br>reliable: we pointed out to Klanter that Fouad Ajami and 
<br>Ahmad Chalabi, two claimed "emissaries" who Klanter cited by 
<br>name, are not carrying messages for the USG. He said 
<br>Sistani's failure to hear from the Americans is leading the 
<br>Grand Ayatollah to think that there might actually be some 
<br>merit to a circulating Iraqi public conspiracy theory that 
<br>the USG and Tehran have done a deal over Iraq. Klanter ended 
<br>the meeting by warning that only Sistani and the Marja'iyyah 
<br>can stand up to Iran and Shia extremism, adding that if the 
<br>USG does not support Sistani, "Iran will devour Iraq."
