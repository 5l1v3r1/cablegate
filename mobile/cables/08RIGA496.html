<br>
<br>¶1. (C)  Summary: Events in Georgia have dominated the news
<br>and discussion here like few other events in recent memory.
<br>Latvians, at least ethic Latvians, look at Georgia and think
<br>that this could easily be them.  As the EU and NATO have been
<br>unable to respond forcefully to Russia -- and many members
<br>advocate for a balanced approach -- Latvians are beginning to
<br>worry if membership in these two organizations provides them
<br>the assurances of their security that they had hoped for when
<br>they joined.  So far, the US willingness to take a tough line
<br>in opposition to Russian actions and in support of Georgia
<br>has been well received here, but some key figures are asking
<br>if the west is fully prepared to deal with a resurgent
<br>Russia.  We expect that the Latvians will make additional
<br>requests for tangible signs of our commitment to their
<br>security in coming weeks and months.  A wild card in Latvian
<br>thinking is how the personal economic ties many key players
<br>have with Russia will influence their thinking - and whether
<br>they continue to believe that they can separate politics and
<br>business with Russia.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Summary, cont'd.  Also influencing events is the fact
<br>that roughly one third of the country is ethnic Russian, who
<br>receive much of their information from Moscow based or
<br>affiliated news sources.  Their perceptions of the crisis in
<br>Georgia and our role are diametrically opposed to those above
<br>and are a reminder of the serious ethnic divide in Latvia.
<br>Unfortunately, while these events have highlighted the need
<br>for greater integration in Latvia, the resulting political
<br>tensions have made integration that much more difficult to
<br>achieve.  End summary.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Georgia dominates here at the moment.  Most any
<br>conversation includes some discussion of the situation,
<br>newscasts and newspapers are covering little else, and
<br>internet discussions are lively and have wide participation.
<br>Among Latvians, at least ethnic Latvians, what you hear is a
<br>sense that this could have been us.  Recalling their own
<br>history with Russia, Latvians have been visibly demonstrating
<br>their support for and solidarity with Georgia.  An August 11
<br>march, advertised only through mentions on newscasts and
<br>online posts, drew over 1,000 people in support of Georgia.
<br>Candle lightings outside the Georgian Embassy are well
<br>attended and Georgian flags can be seen around Riga.
<br>Anecdotal evidence suggests that sales of Georgian wine and
<br>mineral water have increased.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) In discussing events in Georgia, most Latvians we talk
<br>to say that they feel the value of NATO and EU membership and
<br>believe that the possibility that the same thing could happen
<br>to them is greatly reduced.  At the same time, the divisions
<br>in both organizations over how to deal with Russia worry
<br>Latvians.  Comments by Russian Ambassador to Latvia
<br>Veshnyakov that the Baltics and Poland should not "rush to
<br>judgment" lest they encounter "unforeseen consequences" did
<br>not put any nerves at ease.  We reported on MFA views on a
<br>full re-evaluation of relations with Russia and frustration
<br>with NATO and EU positions (Ref A), but it is also worth
<br>noting some of the public comments of key opinion leaders
<br>here.  Former President Vike-Freiberga said she was
<br>"surprised and disappointed" that an emergency GAERC was not
<br>convened until August 13 and that the EU "failed to come out
<br>with a common, coordinated and condemning stance," in
<br>contrast to the joint statement by the Baltic and Polish
<br>Presidents.  Aivars Ozolins, perhaps the country's most
<br>influential columnist, wrote that the crisis has exposed
<br>"serious divisions" in the west on relations with Russia and
<br>argued that Latvia must demand clear plans from NATO to
<br>defend its territory.  He concluded one recent column with
<br>the line, "We are in a new cold war and Latvia is on the
<br>front line."
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) The question of what Latvia does in response is also
<br>vexing to key figures.  PM Godmanis was widely praised for
<br>his visit to Georgia with Baltic, Polish and Ukrainian
<br>leaders, and for delivering a strong message of support (and
<br>President Zatlers has been criticized for not cutting short
<br>his visit to the Olympics in China).  The parliament adopted
<br>a tough resolution critical of Russia and calling on the EU
<br>and NATO to reconsider their approach to Moscow.  Latvia has
<br>reaffirmed its strong support for MAP for both Georgia and
<br>Ukraine.  But Latvians are frustrated that they cannot do
<br>more to influence the situation directly.  They want to be an
<br>active voice in debates at both headquarters in Brussels, but
<br>feel lost between the big powers.  They see their best hopes
<br>as getting the Nordics on board with the Baltics, Poland and
<br>Czech Republic and are heartened by what they view as
<br>realistic comments on a "changed situation with Russia"
<br>coming out of Stockholm and Helsinki in particular.  Former
<br>
<br>RIGA 00000496  002 OF 003
<br>
<br>FM Pabriks told the Ambassador that "Now it is important that
<br>Latvia works to convince the EU that there is no business as
<br>usual with Russia."
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) In this, though, Latvia will face its own internal
<br>challenges.  Many people in Latvia, including key political
<br>figures, have very lucrative business relationships with
<br>Russia that they fear losing.  It was telling that FM
<br>Riekstins, asked about the future of bilateral relations,
<br>remarked that "business is business." (ref B)  Leaders of the
<br>People's Party, to which Riekstins belongs, have many
<br>business deals with Russia, notably in the energy sector.
<br>Transport minister Ainars Slesers, who has made a fortune off
<br>real estate and transit deals that rely heavily on Russia,
<br>stated at the parliamentary debate on Georgia that "although
<br>Russia clearly crossed a line a in its response, we need to
<br>at least consider whether Saakashvili does not bear some
<br>blame for provoking this crisis."  From sensitive sources, we
<br>understand that immediately after the crisis broke out, the
<br>Russian Ambassador to Latvia called Slesers and former PM
<br>(and People's Party founder) Andris Skele to explain Russia's
<br>position.  We think it is no accident that he called two of
<br>Latvia's three oligarchs (and while he didn't call Aivars
<br>Lembergs directly, he also called the parliamentary leader of
<br>the party closest to Lembergs) to try to play the business
<br>card to build political support for Russia.  As the days move
<br>on, key figures in Latvia will likely find that they face
<br>much tougher choices on relations with Russia than just
<br>whether to cease NATO military cooperation with Russia or end
<br>EU negotiations on visa facilitation.  The one exception to
<br>this may be PM Godmanis.  As reported in other channels, he
<br>immediately recognized the possibility for Russian
<br>retaliation through the energy sector and ordered contingency
<br>plans drawn up.  Unfortunately, we expect that the first
<br>instincts of many of the other political players will be to
<br>do everything they can to preserve their personal business
<br>deals, clinging to their naive idea that business and
<br>politics with Russia can be separated.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) One area where we do expect to see concrete actions by
<br>the Latvians is to increase their military preparedness.  PM
<br>Godmanis was clear with the Ambassador that this needed to be
<br>done, even knowing the costs involved.  (ref C)  The Defense
<br>Minister has stated publicly that Latvia needs to review its
<br>own defense posture and privately told us that he will look
<br>for US assistance in this project.  We can expect further
<br>political calls for a comprehensive NATO plan to defend the
<br>Baltics.  Former FM Pabriks suggested to us that Latvia needs
<br>to look at increasing the size of its military forces, noting
<br>that Georgia, less than twice as large as Latvia, had 2,000
<br>troops in Iraq when Latvia had a hard time finding even 100
<br>to deploy.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) The aspect of the Georgia crisis that has ethnic
<br>Latvian especially nervous is the Russian claim that they
<br>went in to Georgia to protect Russian citizens.  Latvia's
<br>population is nearly one-third ethic Russian and half of
<br>those, more than 420,000 people, are not citizens of Latvia.
<br>While only a small number (estimated at roughly 20,000) have
<br>Russian citizenship, Russia has been taking steps to increase
<br>ties with these "compatriots" through steps such as waiving
<br>visa requirements to enter Russia and providing access to
<br>educational and social benefits in Russia.  This population
<br>gets its information from a completely separate media space
<br>that relies heavily on Moscow sources for its foreign news.
<br>As a result, Russian language media here is talking of
<br>Georgian 'genocide' in South Ossetia, suggesting that the US
<br>endorsed Saakashvili's move on Tsinkvali in advance, and
<br>drawing parallels to Kosovo.  (septel will report on this in
<br>greater detail)
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Some Latvians recognize that the lesson of Georgia is
<br>that Latvia needs to do more to integrate its ethnic Russian
<br>population and have them view themselves as Latvian (or at
<br>least European Union) citizens first and Russians second.
<br>Political scientist Peteris Vinkelis, himself married to a
<br>Russian, ended a television interview on events in Georgia
<br>with a plea for the two communities to work together and find
<br>common ground so as not to become like Georgia.  Other senior
<br>officials have told us that they would also like to see
<br>progress on this front.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) All of those good ideas, though, go out the window
<br>the minute politics is injected and there are few issues as
<br>politically divisive here as integration of the Russian
<br>speaking population.  With a crowded political field among
<br>the ethnic Latvian based parties, none of them are willing to
<br>risk the firestorm that would ensue from advocating any
<br>change to the citizenship process.  In fact, more likely is
<br>that they will take steps to, for example, increase the
<br>number of jobs for which certification of Latvian language
<br>skills are required.  Logical steps on integration, such as
<br>
<br>RIGA 00000496  003 OF 003
<br>
<br>allowing everyone born in Latvia automatic citizenship, are
<br>rejected because they are what Moscow has been pushing for
<br>years and ethnic Latvians are unwilling, as they see it, to
<br>"reward Russia's aggression in Georgia" by easing the
<br>requirements for citizenship.  Meanwhile, ethnic Russians are
<br>unlikely to respond to events by seeking Latvian citizenship
<br>and some of the more radical elements will hope that Russia
<br>might decide to make acquisition of Russian citizenship
<br>easier for this group.
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) The challenge for the United States policy in Latvia
<br>given events in Georgia is to consider ways that we can
<br>bolster our relationship to both assure Latvians of our
<br>continued commitment to their security and helps them develop
<br>the tools needed for coping with changed relations with
<br>Russia, including in their domestic situation.  We will be
<br>putting our heads together here and sending in some thoughts
<br>in coming days.
