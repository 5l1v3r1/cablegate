<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary:  Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov remains a loyal
<br>member of United Russia, with a reputation for ensuring that
<br>the city has the resources it needs to function smoothly.
<br>Questions increasingly arise regarding Luzhkov's connections
<br>to the criminal world and the impact of these ties on
<br>governance.  Luzhkov remains in a solid position due to his
<br>value as a consistent deliverer of votes for the ruling
<br>party.  Unfortunately, the shadowy world of corrupt business
<br>practices under Luzhkov continues in Moscow, with corrupt
<br>officials requiring bribes from businesses attempting to
<br>operate in the city.  End Summary.
<br>
<br>Overview: The Kremlin's Luzhkov Dilemma
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov is the embodiment of
<br>political dilemma for the Kremlin.  A loyal, founding member
<br>of United Russia and a trusted deliverer of votes and
<br>influence for the ruling party and its leader, Prime Minister
<br>Putin,  Luzhkov's connections to Moscow's business community
<br>-- the big and legitimate as well as the marginal and corrupt
<br>-- has enabled him to call for support when he needs it, to
<br>deliver votes for United Russia, or to ensure that the city
<br>has the resources it needs to function smoothly.  Luzhkov's
<br>national reputation as the man who governs the ungovernable,
<br>who cleans the streets, keeps the Metro running and maintains
<br>order in Europe's largest metropolis of almost 11 million
<br>people, earns him a certain amount of slack from government
<br>and party leaders.  He oversaw what even United Russia
<br>insiders acknowledge was a dirty, compromised election for
<br>the Moscow City Duma in October, and yet received only a slap
<br>on the wrist from President Medvedev.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Muscovites are increasingly questioning the standard
<br>operating procedures of their chief executive, a man who, as
<br>of 2007, they no longer directly elect.  Luzhkov's
<br>connections to the criminal world and the impact that these
<br>ties have had on governance and development in Moscow are
<br>increasingly a matter of public discussion.  Although Luzhkov
<br>was successful in winning court-ordered damages from
<br>opposition leader Boris Nemtsov for his recent publication
<br>"Luzhkov: An Accounting," Nemtsov and his Solidarity-movement
<br>allies were heartened by the fact that the judge did not
<br>award damages on the basis of the corruption accusations
<br>themselves, but rather on a libel technicality.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Few believe that Luzhkov will voluntarily relinquish
<br>his post prior to 2012, when the Moscow City Duma must submit
<br>a list of mayoral candidates to Medvedev for his selection.
<br>United Russia will probably call on Luzhkov's political
<br>machine and his genuine public support to deliver votes for
<br>them in the 2011 State Duma elections, as well as the 2012
<br>Presidential contest.  With no apparent successor in line,
<br>and with no ambitions beyond remaining mayor, Luzhkov is in a
<br>solid position.  The evidence of his involvement -- or at
<br>least association -- with corruption remains significant.
<br>This cable presents that side of Luzhkov -- one that bears
<br>not only on Luzhkov and his handling of local politics, but
<br>on Putin and Medvedev as they move toward the 2012 elections.
<br>
<br>Background on Moscow's Criminal World
<br>-------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) The Moscow city government's direct links to
<br>criminality have led some to call it "dysfunctional," and to
<br>assert that the government operates more as a kleptocracy
<br>than a government.  Criminal elements enjoy a "krysha" (a
<br>term from the criminal/mafia world literally meaning "roof"
<br>or protection) that runs through the police, the Federal
<br>Security Service (FSB), Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD),
<br>and the prosecutor's office, as well as throughout the Moscow
<br>city government bureaucracy.  Analysts identify a
<br>three-tiered structure in Moscow's criminal world.  Luzhkov
<br>is at the top.  The FSB, MVD, and militia are at the second
<br>level.  Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors
<br>are at the lowest level.  This is an inefficient system in
<br>which criminal groups fill a void in some areas because the
<br>city is not providing some services.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX,
<br>told us that Moscow's ethnic criminal groups do business and
<br>give paybacks.  It is the federal headquarters of the
<br>parties, not the criminal groups, who decide who will
<br>participate in politics.  XXXXXXXXXXXX argued that the
<br>political parties are the ones with the political clout;
<br>therefore, they have some power over these criminal groups.
<br>
<br>MOSCOW 00000317  002 OF 003
<br>
<br>Crime groups work with municipal bureaucrats, but at a low
<br>level.  For example, the Armenians and Georgians were
<br>formerly heavily involved in the gambling business before
<br>city officials closed the gambling facilities.  These ethnic
<br>groups needed protection from law enforcement crackdowns, so
<br>they sought cooperation with the municipal bureaucrats.  In
<br>such scenarios, crime groups paid the Moscow police for
<br>protection.
<br>
<br>Luzhkov's Links to Criminal Figures
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX, told us that Luzhkov's wife,
<br>Yelena Baturina, definitely has links to the criminal world,
<br>and particularly to the Solntsevo criminal group (widely
<br>regarded by Russian law enforcement as one of the most
<br>powerful organized crime groups in Russia).  According to the
<br>Internet article, "On the Moscow Group," Vladimir
<br>Yevtushenko, the head of the company Sistema, is married to
<br>Natalya Yevtushenko, Baturina's sister.  Sistema was created
<br>with Moscow city government-owned shares, and Sistema
<br>initially focused on privatizing the capital's real estate
<br>and gas.  Sistema's president, Yevgeny Novitsky, controlled
<br>the Solntsevo criminal gang.  Today, Sistema has spun off
<br>into various companies, which implement projects that
<br>typically include 50 percent funding from the Moscow city
<br>government.
<br>
<br>¶8. (S) According to XXXXXXXXXXXX, Luzhkov used criminal money to
<br>support his rise to power and has been involved with bribes
<br>and deals regarding lucrative construction contracts
<br>throughout Moscow.  XXXXXXXXXXXX told us that Luzhkov's friends and
<br>associates (including recently deceased crime boss Vyacheslav
<br>Ivankov and reputedly corrupt Duma Deputy Joseph Kobzon) are
<br>"bandits."  He told us that he knew this because he formerly
<br>had contacts in these criminal groups, but many of his
<br>contacts have since been killed.  XXXXXXXXXXXX said that the Moscow
<br>government has links to many different criminal groups and it
<br>regularly takes cash bribes from businesses.  The people
<br>under Luzhkov maintain these criminal connections.  Recently,
<br>ultranationalist LDPR opposition party leader Vladimir
<br>Zhirinovskiy strongly criticized Luzhkov and called for him
<br>to step down, claiming that Luzhkov's government was the
<br>"most criminal" in Russian history.  This remarkable
<br>denunciation, carried on state TV flagship Channel One, was
<br>widely seen as an indirect Kremlin rebuke of Luzhkov.
<br>
<br>¶9. (S) XXXXXXXXXXXX told us everyone knows that Russia's laws do not
<br>work.  The Moscow system is based on officials making money.
<br>The government bureaucrats, FSB, MVD, police, and
<br>prosecutor's offices all accept bribes.  XXXXXXXXXXXX stated that
<br>everything depends on the Kremlin and he thought that
<br>Luzhkov, as well as many mayors and governors, pay off key
<br>insiders in the Kremlin.  XXXXXXXXXXXX argued that the vertical
<br>works because people are paying bribes all the way to the
<br>top.  He told us that people often witness officials going
<br>into the Kremlin with large suitcases and bodyguards, and he
<br>speculated that the suitcases are full of money.  The
<br>governors collect money based on bribes, almost resembling a
<br>tax system, throughout their regions.  XXXXXXXXXXXX described how
<br>there are parallel structures in the regions in which people
<br>are able to pay their leaders.  For instance, the FSB, MVD,
<br>and militia all have distinct money collection systems.
<br>Further, XXXXXXXXXXXX told us that deputies generally have to buy
<br>their seats in the government.  They need money to get to the
<br>top, but once they are there, their positions become quite
<br>lucrative money making opportunities.  Bureaucrats in Moscow
<br>are notorious for doing all kinds of illegal business to get
<br>extra money.
<br>
<br>¶10. (S) According to XXXXXXXXXXXX, Luzhkov is following orders
<br>from the Kremlin to not go after Moscow's criminal groups.
<br>For example, XXXXXXXXXXXX argued that it was only a public
<br>relations stunt from Putin to close gambling.  In contrast to
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX said he did not see the sense in suitcases
<br>of money going into the Kremlin since it would be easier to
<br>open a secret account in Cyprus.  He speculated that the
<br>Moscow police heads have a secret war chest of money.
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX said that this money is likely used to solve
<br>problems that the Kremlin decides, such as rigging elections.
<br>It can be accessed as a resource for when orders come from
<br>above, for example, for bribes or to pay off people when
<br>necessary.  XXXXXXXXXXXX postulated that the Kremlin might say
<br>to a governor that he can rule a certain territory but in
<br>exchange he must do what the Kremlin says.
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Notwithstanding Luzhkov's solid position, some of our
<br>contacts believe that cracks have appeared in his armor, due
<br>
<br>MOSCOW 00000317  003 OF 003
<br>
<br>to his corrupt activities.  XXXXXXXXXXXX told us that Luzhkov has
<br>many enemies because his wife has the most lucrative business
<br>deals in Moscow and many people think Luzhkov has received
<br>too much money.  The son of the head of the interior police,
<br>Vladimir Kolokotsev, told XXXXXXXXXXXX that Kolokotsev's number one
<br>job is to get Luzhkov out within a year.  Kolokotsev was
<br>credited with removing long-standing Governor Yegor Stroyev
<br>from Orel.  XXXXXXXXXXXX asserted that Luzhkov is "on his way
<br>out," although he acknowledged that the Kremlin has not
<br>identified a suitable replacement yet.  Issues such as
<br>corruption and traffic congestion have, to a certain degree,
<br>eroded Luzhkov's popularity.  Putin, XXXXXXXXXXXX said, will
<br>likely pick the quietest and least expected person to replace
<br>Luzhkov.
<br>
<br>In Moscow, Everyone Needs a "Krysha"
<br>------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) According to many observers, the lawless criminal
<br>climate in Russia makes it difficult for businesses to
<br>survive without being defended by some type of protection.
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX explained how bribes work in Moscow:  a cafe owner
<br>pays the local police chief via cash through a courier.  He
<br>needs to pay a certain negotiated amount over a certain
<br>profit.  The high prices of goods in Moscow cover these
<br>hidden costs.  Sometimes people receive "bad protection" in
<br>the sense that the "krysha" extorts an excessive amount of
<br>money.  As a result, they cannot make enough of a profit to
<br>maintain their businesses.  If people attempt to forego
<br>protection, they will instantly be shut down.  For example,
<br>officials from the fire or sanitation service will appear at
<br>the business and invent a violation.  According to
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX, everyone has bought into the idea of protection
<br>in Moscow, so it has become a norm.  In general, Muscovites
<br>have little freedom to speak out against corrupt activities
<br>and are afraid of their leaders.
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX explained that Moscow business owners
<br>understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and
<br>FSB (rather than organized crime groups) since they not only
<br>have more guns, resources, and power than criminal groups,
<br>but they are also protected by the law.  For this reason,
<br>protection from criminal gangs is no longer so high in
<br>demand.  Police and MVD collect money from small businesses
<br>while the FSB collects from big businesses.  According to
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX, the FSB "krysha" is allegedly the best protection.  He
<br>told us that, while the MVD and FSB both have close links to
<br>Solntsevo, the FSB is the real "krysha" for Solntsevo.  This
<br>system is not an incentive for smaller businesses and nobody
<br>is immune; even rich people who think they are protected get
<br>arrested.  According to Transparency International's 2009
<br>survey, bribery costs Russia USD 300 billion a year, or about
<br>18 percent of its gross domestic product.  XXXXXXXXXXXX argued
<br>that the "krysha" system has led to an erosion of police
<br>internal discipline.  For instance, young police officers
<br>spend their money buying luxury vehicles that a normal worker
<br>could never afford.
<br>
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶14. (S) Despite Medvedev's stated anti-corruption campaign,
<br>the extent of corruption in Moscow remains pervasive with
<br>Mayor Luzhkov at the top of the pyramid.  Luzhkov oversees a
<br>system in which it appears that almost everyone at every
<br>level is involved in some form of corruption or criminal
<br>behavior.  Putin and Medvedev's dilemma is deciding when
<br>Luzhkov becomes a bigger liability than asset.  While public
<br>sentiment against Luzhkov has grown since the "tainted"
<br>elections in October 2009, United Russia's leadership knows
<br>that he has been a loyal supporter who can deliver voter
<br>support. Ousting Luzhkov before he is ready to go could
<br>create major difficulties because he could link others in the
<br>government to the corruption.  While reforming Luzhkov's
<br>questionable activities might seem like the right thing to
<br>do, for now keeping him in place, efficiently running the
<br>city, is United Russia's best option.  Ultimately, the tandem
<br>will put Luzhkov out to pasture, like it has done with fellow
<br>long-term regional leaders like Sverdlovsk oblast governor
<br>Edward Rossel and Tatarstan President Mintimir Shaymiyev.
