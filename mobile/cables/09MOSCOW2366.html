<br>¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The USG has an opportunity to work with Russia to
<br>combat illegal logging, and increasing reasons to do so. Russia
<br>contains more of the world's forested area than any other country --
<br>approximately 20 percent -- and between 10 and 30 percent of wood is
<br>harvested illegally. Illegal logging leads to environmental
<br>degradation, exacerbates global climate change, and disrupts trade
<br>and local economies. Russia's illegal logging problem is magnified
<br>by systemic flaws in the forest management system and an inadequate
<br>legal framework, many stemming from the new Forest Code of 2006.
<br>The U.S. Forest Service (USFS) has worked with some Russian regional
<br>governments to combat illegal logging. There are several new
<br>opportunities for cooperation on this issue, including the planned
<br>new Protocol of Intent between the USFS and the Russian Federal
<br>Forestry Agency, as well as the Embassy's proposal for $200,000 in
<br>FY2008 performance funds to address illegal logging. END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>Russia's Forests - World's Largest and Most Degraded
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) Russia contains approximately 22 percent of the world's
<br>forested area, more than any other country. (NOTE: Second-place
<br>Brazil has 16 percent. END NOTE.) Russia's boreal forests are the
<br>Earth's largest forested region. Russia has more than 55 percent of
<br>the world's conifers, which comprise over 21 percent of the world's
<br>growing stock, and 11 percent of the world's live forest biomass.
<br>Russia's over 887 million hectares of forest and woodland cover 52
<br>percent of its land area -- equivalent to about 95 percent of the
<br>area of the United States, including Alaska. Boreal forests make up
<br>about one-third of the world's forested area and one-third of the
<br>world's stored carbon. Together, Russia and the United States have
<br>two-thirds of the world's boreal forests. This broad band of mixed
<br>coniferous and deciduous trees stretches across northern North
<br>America, Europe and Asia, with taiga along its northern edge meeting
<br>Arctic tundra.
<br>
<br>¶3. (U) Russia's forests are vital economic, biodiversity, cultural,
<br>and climate change assets. And as in many countries, they are under
<br>increasing threat from illegal logging, unsustainable forestry
<br>practices, and forest fires. Illegal logging reduces the forests'
<br>carbon uptake; it is estimated that forest fires and illegal logging
<br>contribute 5-15 percent of Russian greenhouse gas emissions. An
<br>August 25, 2009, ScienceDaily press release characterized Russian
<br>boreal forest as the world's most degraded and least intact and
<br>found that it has suffered the greatest decline in the last few
<br>decades.
<br>
<br>A Quarter of Russia's Logging Illegal?
<br>--------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) Estimates vary as to the amount of illegal logging. In
<br>April 2008, the Environment News Service quoted Ministry of Natural
<br>Resources and Ecology (MNRE) Deputy Head Semyon Levi estimating that
<br>10 percent of Russian timber is illegally harvested. Greenpeace
<br>Russia estimates are between 20 and 30 percent. In some regions, it
<br>is estimated that up to half of the timber is being harvested
<br>illegally. There are three types of illegal logging in Russia:
<br>
<br>-- unauthorized commercial logging operations;
<br>
<br>-- legitimate commercial operations that illegally augment their
<br>harvest by cutting timber outside of authorized zones; and
<br>
<br>-- non-commercial harvesting by locals for fuel, construction, and
<br>other personal uses.
<br>
<br>¶5. (U) Powerful organized crime groups are involved in illegal
<br>commercial logging, abetted by local corruption. Poachers and
<br>organized crime groups even set fire to woodlands to facilitate
<br>illegal logging, later securing the contracts to clear the burned
<br>areas.
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) There are strong economic incentives for illegal logging,
<br>particularly in border regions close to foreign markets. But the
<br>
<br>Moscow 00002366 002.2 of 004
<br>
<br>
<br>extent of illegal logging is driven primarily by systemic weaknesses
<br>in Russia's forest management practices. In 2006, Russia introduced
<br>a new forest code intended to encourage sustainable forest use by
<br>large corporations. Instead, forestry experts have told us, the new
<br>code decimated forest protection. It decentralized forest
<br>management by moving forestry administration from federal to
<br>regional authorities, assigned the responsibility for forestry
<br>infrastructure and reforestation to lessee logging companies, and
<br>did away with the federally employed cadre of forest rangers that
<br>once enforced a standardized set of federal regulations. Forestry
<br>management is now subject to the vagaries of regional budgets and
<br>governments.
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) Illegal logging is also aggravated by the lack of effective
<br>prosecution. Prosecution is hindered by the absence of an effective
<br>timber tracking system to establish a chain of custody for every
<br>tree that is cut. Once trees are cut and loaded onto trucks,
<br>internal customs officials and forestry inspectors have no way of
<br>knowing the exact origin of the timber. Weak enforcement and
<br>monitoring is also a problem, with the number of forest rangers
<br>reduced dramatically by the new forest code. In one region, the
<br>number of rangers was reduced from 200-300 to only three. Some law
<br>enforcement officials claim that another obstacle is the poorly
<br>written, vague body of laws that demand a standard of proof that is
<br>extremely difficult to achieve. A police official in the Ivanovo
<br>region told the English-language daily "Moscow Times" that
<br>prosecuting illegal loggers is nearly impossible because, unless the
<br>loggers are caught in the act, they can show lease documents from
<br>anywhere in Russia and claim that they are simply transporting the
<br>timber. This inadequate legal framework raises concern that persons
<br>caught logging illegally cannot be prosecuted in a timely and
<br>effective manner, which the U.S. Forest Service asserts is critical
<br>to effective forest management.
<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU) China is the primary market for illegal Russian timber,
<br>much of which reaches the United States as finished products. A
<br>long investigative report in "The New Yorker" reported in October
<br>2008 that the greatest traffic in illicit wood is thought to be from
<br>Russia to China. Commercial illegal logging for export to China is
<br>concentrated in the Far East border regions. According to a 2007
<br>U.S. Forest Service report, 20-50 percent of timber harvested in the
<br>Krasnoyarsk region is illegal, with most sent to China. In January
<br>2009, authorities caught a Chinese company attempting to export
<br>4,000 cubic meters of oak and ash valued at 2 million dollars from
<br>Primorye using fake export documents. Two officers of the
<br>Khabarovsk Regional Service for Economic Crimes detained in 2007
<br>were ultimately found guilty of aiding Chinese and Russian companies
<br>in illegally harvesting and exporting Russian timber. Given the
<br>high percentage of illegally harvested timber, it is particularly
<br>worrisome for the United States that 50 percent of soft wood and 90
<br>percent of hardwood harvested in the Russian Far East and Siberia
<br>ends up in the United States as finished goods after being processed
<br>in China, according to Denis Smirnov, coordinator of the World
<br>Wildlife Fund's forestry program in Primorye (reftel).
<br>
<br>Growing Attention to Illegal Logging
<br>------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶9. (SBU) The Russian government and local communities are
<br>increasingly aware of the effects of illegal logging. We are slowly
<br>seeing an increase in activities to promote sustainable forestry and
<br>to stop illegal logging.
<br>
<br>-- FLEG Commitments: In the St. Petersburg Ministerial Declaration
<br>at the 2005 Europe and North Asia Forest Law Enforcement and
<br>Governance conference (ENA FLEG), 44 governments, including Russia
<br>and the United States, expressed their intent to take action to
<br>improve forest governance and combat illegal logging and associated
<br>forest crimes. The Declaration includes an Indicative List of
<br>Actions to implement the declaration and calls for a second
<br>Ministerial within 5 years to assess progress made and decide on
<br>further actions needed.
<br>
<br>-- Plans for a National Timber Tracking System: In April 2009,
<br>Alexei Savinov, head of the Ministry of Agriculture's Federal
<br>Forestry Agency, announced that by 2011 Russia will have introduced
<br>an integrated system to control timber circulation and decrease
<br>
<br>Moscow 00002366 003.2 of 004
<br>
<br>
<br>illegal logging. With support from the U.S. Forest Service and
<br>USAID, Krasnoyarsk Authorities in 2008 sought funding from the
<br>Ministry of Natural Resources to introduce a timber tracking system.
<br>(NOTE: At that time the Forestry Agency was under the umbrella of
<br>the Ministry of Natural Resources; now it is under the Ministry of
<br>Agriculture. END NOTE.) Krasnoyarsk, in Central Siberia, is
<br>Russia's second largest administrative territory, producing
<br>one-fifth of Russia's total timber output. According to USFS
<br>estimates, 20-50 percent of Krasnoyarsk's timber is harvested
<br>illegally. The lack of federal funding and subsequent personnel
<br>changes in both the Russian Federal Forest Agency and in the
<br>Krasnoyarsk administration have so far stymied introduction of this
<br>pilot chain-of-custody system.
<br>
<br>-- Increased Domestic Timber Processing: Both President Medvedev
<br>and Prime Minister Putin have endorsed the development of timber
<br>processing as a national goal. Although their support is driven
<br>mainly by economic concerns -- creating jobs and developing local
<br>industry by exporting finished products instead of raw wood --
<br>creating timber processing facilities in Russia could help reduce
<br>illegal logging. By expanding local processing capacity, Russia
<br>would reduce the incentive to export illegally harvested raw timber
<br>to other countries for processing, though mechanisms will have to be
<br>put in place to ensure any illegally harvested raw timber is not
<br>instead simply processed directly in Russia itself. Officials in
<br>Tomsk informed us that they are facilitating the establishment of
<br>Chinese wood processing facilities in the region, which they noted
<br>might discourage the export of illegal wood. As part of the
<br>government's goal to increase domestic wood processing they have
<br>gradually increased the export tariffs on logs. On April 1, 2008,
<br>the tariff increased to 25 percent, but not less than 15 euros, and
<br>as of January 1, 2010, up to 80 percent, but not less than 50 euros,
<br>making the cost of importing unprocessed logs from Russia
<br>prohibitive.
<br>
<br>-- Civil Society Activity: Local residents in Primorye, frustrated
<br>by the inaction of police and local authorities, often stage
<br>protests to attract attention to illegal logging. WWF and other
<br>environmental NGOs support their efforts. Residents of Melnichnoye,
<br>a village north of Vladivostok, staged a summer 2008 protest against
<br>"sanitary cutting," whereby logging companies supposedly harvest
<br>dead trees and clean woodlands after fires (reftel). In fact,
<br>according to villagers, loggers cut down healthy trees and leave
<br>behind wastelands instead of protected forests.
<br>
<br>¶10. (SBU) Organized crime is a serious threat to civilian
<br>environmental activists in illegal logging locales. According to
<br>WWF and nature preserve workers in the Russian Far East, the local
<br>"forest mafia," a group engaged in illegal timber operations, has
<br>openly declared war on those working to preserve forests and enforce
<br>environmental laws. The house of Yuriy Bersenev, a WWF project
<br>coordinator who works to safeguard protected nature preserves, was
<br>set on fire by unknown perpetrators in the winter of 2009. This
<br>incident came on the heels of two earlier attempts to intimidate WWF
<br>staff in Primorye in December 2008, including another case of arson
<br>(ref A). Yuriy Bersenev attributes the current drastic situation to
<br>the weakness of national forest legislation and the rampancy of
<br>corruption in the Russian Far East, USFS is beginning work on a
<br>$200,000 performance fund project to create linkages between NGOs,
<br>law enforcement, business, wardens, and regional officials to reduce
<br>illegal logging.
<br>
<br>-- Lacey Act: The Lacey Act amendments of 2008 expanded the
<br>statute's anti-trafficking protections for the purpose of combating
<br>illegal logging. The act now covers timber illegally harvested in
<br>the country of origin and brought into the United States, either
<br>directly or through manufactured products. The reinforced Lacey Act
<br>has prompted large timber-product importers such as Wal-Mart to
<br>reexamine their supply chains to ensure compliance. Consequently,
<br>the Lacey Act puts significant pressure on regional governments in
<br>Russia to fight illegal logging at the risk of losing the business
<br>and contacts so valuable to their economies. With the Lacey Act
<br>calling attention to the international trade in illegal timber,
<br>Russian and Chinese businesses are more conscious of the need to
<br>prove legality to American companies, leading them to seek official
<br>logging permits from the Federal Forestry Agency. xxxxx
<br>
<br>COMMENT: Potential for Expanded Cooperation
<br>-------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶11. (SBU) The United States and Russia have a number of
<br>opportunities to work bilaterally and multilaterally in the coming
<br>year to stem illegal logging:
<br>
<br>-- A new protocol of intent between USFS and USAID, jointly, and the
<br>Russian Federal Forestry Agency, will be signed in the next few
<br>months. The POI addresses several forestry issues, including illegal
<br>logging. It can help spur policy dialogue and exchange of best
<br>practices on implementing environmental regulations, promoting
<br>sustainable forestry practices, engaging civil society, and
<br>expanding environmental education. It should also assist in reducing
<br>the number and extent of fires through increasing the forest
<br>managers' monitoring capacities. USFS specialists are attending an
<br>October workshop in Khabarovsk, which they see as a valuable
<br>stepping stone in the larger illegal logging project.
<br>
<br>-- Russia took the initiative to host the 2005 FLEG conference, and
<br>the U.S. has played a critical role as organizer in the program.
<br>With a planned assessment of progress in 2010, the United States has
<br>an opportunity to become more involved.
<br>
<br>-- The U.S. can also cooperate with Russian law enforcement to help
<br>expand its capacity to investigate the causes of illegal logging and
<br>forest fires and their connection to organized criminal groups.
<br>
<br>¶12. (SBU) One possible model for cooperation is the May 2008
<br>U.S.-China Memorandum of Understanding on Illegal Logging and
<br>Associated Trade. A similar agreement with Russia, which could even
<br>involve China as a third party, might facilitate cooperation among
<br>the three countries to strengthen forest law enforcement and
<br>governance.
