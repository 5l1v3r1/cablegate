<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Through surveillance, arrests and other 
<br>methods, the GOF prevents or puts out brushfires of Islamic 
<br>extremism on an almost daily basis, and has been doing so for 
<br>decades. According to recent press reports, the RG, France's 
<br>police intelligence service, estimates that 6 million Muslims 
<br>live in France, approximately 10 percent of the population. 
<br>The RG estimates that approximately 9,000 of them might be 
<br>extremist. These numbers, coupled with a widespread 
<br>recognition that France continues to struggle mightily to 
<br>integrate its immigrant/Muslim population, provide a sober 
<br>counterpoint to the past success and unquestionable 
<br>capabilities of the counter-terrorism apparatus. Although in 
<br>the short and medium-term, France clearly can rely on its 
<br>police, security and judicial services to aggressively combat 
<br>terrorism, in the long-term it must focus on giving a place 
<br>to Muslims (be they first-generation immigrants, their 
<br>second- and third-generation children, or the growing number 
<br>of converts) in the French identity. End summary. 
<br>
<br>THE POTENTIAL OF ISLAMIC EXTREMISM 
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) In the Muslim community of some six million, 70 
<br>percent are estimated to be of North African (Algeria, 
<br>Morocco, and Tunisia) origin. Other sizable groups include 
<br>Turks and Pakistanis. Within this overall population, the RG 
<br>estimates (according to recent press reports) that roughly 
<br>9,000 could be considered extremist, or, just over one-tenth 
<br>of one percent. The RG also estimated that of the 1,500 
<br>mosques and prayer halls in France, fewer than 40 were 
<br>considered extremist. GOF officials routinely claim that 90 
<br>percent of French Muslims are non-practicing. Among the 
<br>minority of French Muslims considered "practicing," there is 
<br>a small but distinct current of fundamentalist thought. On 
<br>August 5, Poloffs toured a number of Islamic bookshops in 
<br>Paris, and found that the literature extolled strongly 
<br>conservative views on the role of Muslim women and also 
<br>included numerous guides (in French) of how to pray. The 
<br>bookstores did not present any moderate alternatives to 
<br>conservative dogma. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (U) Two specific sources of Islamic extremism are of 
<br>special interest. First is the French prison system, with a 
<br>population that is estimated at over 50 percent Muslim. 
<br>According to another leaked RG report from May 2005, Islamic 
<br>extremism here is growing in popularity, with scattered 
<br>reports of prisoners hanging up posters of Bin Laden, 
<br>destroying Christmas trees and bibles, and cries of joy at 
<br>the news of American soldiers killed in Iraq or suicide 
<br>bombings in Israel. It is often the shock of prison, 
<br>detailed the RG report, that transforms petty criminals into 
<br>Islamic extremists. The shortage of Muslim chaplains in 
<br>French prisons fuels potential for extremist ideologies to 
<br>spread unabated. Radicalized prisoners, once released, are 
<br>"time bombs," said the RG report. It estimated that within 
<br>the prison system, 200 inmates "merit attention," and 95 of 
<br>these should be considered "dangerous." A second source of 
<br>Islamic extremism is the growing number of conversions to 
<br>radical Islam by European-origin French citizens. In a 
<br>report submitted to Interior Minister Sarkozy in June, the RG 
<br>profiled new French converts to Islam, and found that most 
<br>were young males in urban areas and/or in areas largely 
<br>populated by those of North African descent. Of those 
<br>converts profiled, the RG reported 49 percent did not have 
<br>any diploma, and a full 44 percent opted for Salafist or 
<br>Tabligh-inspired versions of fundamentalist Islam. The 
<br>unemployment rate among new converts of European-French 
<br>origin is five times the national average, according to the 
<br>RG report. More than ten percent of the new converts had 
<br>discovered Islam in prison. The RG report also revealed that 
<br>approximately 3.5 percent of the French military, including 
<br>officers, had converted to Islam. (Note: Although this is a 
<br>striking statistic, many military converts have presumably 
<br>done so in order to marry Muslims, and not necessarily for 
<br>ideological reasons. End note.) 
<br>
<br>FRANCE'S LONG HISTORY WITH ISLAMIC EXTREMISM 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) The sheer number of recent "terrorism conspiracy" 
<br>arrests in France involving Islamic extremists underscores 
<br>the GOF's counter-terrorism challenges. Since 2002, it has 
<br>arrested 322 people linked to terrorism, of whom 91 were 
<br>charged and imprisoned. Islamic extremist violence has 
<br>struck France in the past, especially Paris. A year after a 
<br>failed hijacking attempt of an Air France jet in 1994, the 
<br>Algerian terrorist group GIA conducted a wave of bombings in 
<br>Paris subway stations and landmarks, killing 8 and wounding 
<br>over 200. Spillover from Maghreb-based Islamic extremists 
<br>continues to this day, with the Algerian-based GSPC group and 
<br>the Moroccan-based GICM group both present covertly on French 
<br>soil. Furthermore, French intelligence believes that the 
<br>GSPC has increasingly taken on the goals of worldwide 
<br>jihadism and is seeking to position itself as a complement to 
<br>al-Qaida. A terrorism investigating judge told us recently 
<br>that the GSPC is expanding its reach in France, and is 
<br>working to take advantage of old connections within the 
<br>well-organized Algerian community. As for the GICM, French 
<br>judiciary officials told us that those arrested in 2004 were 
<br>frighteningly professional and maintain to this day a strict 
<br>discipline when interrogated (ref D). (Comment: The GOF 
<br>prides itself on its ability to keep tabs on extremist 
<br>groups; their discovery of the GICM cell shocked them because 
<br>they had stumbled upon it by chance, further evidence of the 
<br>GICM group's operational security. End comment.) 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) France has also seen Islamic extremist cells appear 
<br>with seemingly little to no support from terrorist 
<br>organizations such as the GICM and the GSPC. One example is 
<br>the eleven "jihadists to Iraq" arrested in January in Paris' 
<br>19th arrondissement. Those involved were arrested days 
<br>before leaving for Iraq. The DST told USG interlocutors (ref 
<br>E) that the suspected ringleader, 23-year old Farid 
<br>Benyettou, had never studied theology but by force of 
<br>personality, had managed within a few months to convince a 
<br>group of teenagers to fight jihad in Iraq. One example that 
<br>demonstrates the fluid interconnectedness of many Islamic 
<br>extremists was revealed during the trial of Ahmed Laidouni 
<br>and David Courtailler, two French citizens convicted and 
<br>sentenced in 2004 for organizing recruitment networks for 
<br>terrorist training camps in Afghanistan. Laidouni and 
<br>Courtailler (who converted at the age of 27 to fundamentalist 
<br>Islam) have been linked to members of the Beghal network that 
<br>were convicted in March 2005 of plotting to bomb the U.S. 
<br>Embassy in Paris (ref F). They have also been linked to 
<br>extremist circles in the UK. Members of the Beghal network 
<br>are suspected of having ties with (among others) members of 
<br>the "Chechen" network (a loose grouping of individuals from 
<br>Lyon that attempted to develop chemical agents to commit 
<br>terrorist attacks), the "Frankfurt" network (which attempted 
<br>in 2000 to attack cultural sites in Strasbourg), and Lionel 
<br>Dumont, a member of the Islamic extremist "Roubaix gang" that 
<br>in the late 1990s terrorized the north of France. Dumont 
<br>spent a number of years in Japan, and is suspected of 
<br>building links there to Islamic extremism. In short, Islamic 
<br>political extremism in France takes on many forms: it has 
<br>bubbled up on its own, in cooperation with other autonomous 
<br>groups, and also in cooperation with al-Qaida linked groups 
<br>such as the GSPC. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) Islamic extremism is connected in the public mind to 
<br>the poor suburbs outside of major French cities, especially 
<br>Paris, Lyon, Strasbourg and Marseilles. However, pockets of 
<br>low-income housing are scattered throughout France, and 
<br>recent arrests in Grenoble, a medium-sized university town in 
<br>the southeast, and Lorraine, a region near the French-German 
<br>border, illustrate the fact that Islamic extremism is not 
<br>confined to the suburbs of France's largest cities. French 
<br>residents and citizens of North African extraction are 
<br>scattered throughout France. The Turkish community is based 
<br>largely in Paris and in eastern France, and the Pakistani 
<br>community is based almost exclusively in the Paris 
<br>metropolitan area. 
<br>
<br>THE GOVERNMENT AS FIREFIGHTER 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) Although attention since the July bombings in London 
<br>and Sharm el-Sheikh is on new enforcement and security 
<br>initiatives, the GOF continues its work to integrate the 
<br>Muslim community into what is still a historically Catholic 
<br>country. High-profile Muslims in government, politics and 
<br>culture are relatively rare, and in general, Muslims are 
<br>underrepresented in positions of power. The GOF reached back 
<br>into its history of dealing with other religious/ethnic 
<br>communities when in 2003 it created the Council for the 
<br>Muslim Faith (CFCM), an umbrella organization of various 
<br>Muslim groups which serves as the official French Muslim 
<br>interlocutor with the government on a range of 
<br>civil-religious issues, including mosque construction. The 
<br>CFCM includes a broad brush of Muslim groups, including the 
<br>fundamentalist-leaning UOIF (considered by some to have links 
<br>to the Muslim Brotherhood), the FMNF (also considered 
<br>fundamentalist, but backed by the Moroccan government), and 
<br>the Tabligh (an ultra-orthodox Pakistani origin group 
<br>described as a way-station for some French jihadists). GOF 
<br>officials also point out that around 40 percent of French 
<br>mosques are not CFCM-affiliated. Moreover, the CFCM is 
<br>riddled with internal conflict (ref C), and for many who 
<br>espouse a highly fundamentalist worldview, it is considered 
<br>too close to the GOF. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (U) Another GOF initiative to spur the growth of a 
<br>moderate, France-centric Islam is to encourage imams to speak 
<br>French and learn more about French culture. More than half 
<br>of the imams in France either do not speak French or speak it 
<br>very poorly. In addition, less than 20 percent have French 
<br>nationality. New immigration policies stipulate that those 
<br>wishing to attain French citizenship must receive a GOF 
<br>certification of French fluency. Although this new policy 
<br>does not specifically target imams, their participation is 
<br>encouraged. A similar initiative, proposed by PM Villepin 
<br>when he was Interior Minister, has been stymied. Villepin 
<br>said he would push French universities to inaugurate specific 
<br>courses for imams on French culture. Only the Sorbonne 
<br>university evinced any interest, although it finally 
<br>announced in early August that it would not proceed with the 
<br>imam program because it ran counter to the principles of 
<br>secularism. 
<br>
<br>ALTHOUGH CONFIDENT IN ITS "OFFENSIVE" C/T STRATEGY, FRANCE 
<br>STILL STRUGGLES WITH INTEGRATION 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
<br>
<br>¶9. (U) Notwithstanding the recent spurt of GOF 
<br>counter-terrorism proposals (ref B), the French government 
<br>and media generally believe the GOF's method of fighting 
<br>Islamic extremism works well. A July 12 article in Le Figaro 
<br>outlined the two basic approaches, France's "offensive" 
<br>strategy and the UK's "communitarian" strategy. Louis 
<br>Caprioli, former head of the DST's counter-terrorism bureau 
<br>(the DST is France's internal security service), said the 
<br>French strategy emphasizes total cooperation between the 
<br>security/police services and the specialized 
<br>counter-terrorism judiciary. This allows for constant 
<br>surveillance of suspects and a focus on maximum disturbance 
<br>of Islamic extremists, hence the "offensive" nature of the 
<br>strategy. Alain Chouet, former head of the DGSE (France's 
<br>external intelligence service), added that the presence of 
<br>the RG throughout French territory allows for "permanent 
<br>surveillance and penetration of problematic communities." 
<br>Furthermore, said Chouet, "It is hard to imagine the 
<br>Anglo-Saxon countries imitating our harassment tactics, which 
<br>sometimes take place without any real proof of wrongdoing." 
<br>(Comment: There is undoubtedly a whiff of traditional Gallic 
<br>competitiveness regarding the "Anglo-Saxons" in these 
<br>comparisons of counter-terrorism models. Of all those 
<br>calling for additional C/T proposals in France following the 
<br>July attacks, only the unabashedly pro-Anglo-Saxon Sarkozy 
<br>pointedly said France had something to learn from the British 
<br>public transport surveillance system. End comment) 
<br>
<br>¶10. (U) Although most believe the GOF's "offensive" 
<br>counter-terrorism approach has been successful, many consider 
<br>that the GOF has failed in its quest to integrate those in 
<br>the marginalized suburbs, or "cites". Jean-Marie Colombani, 
<br>the editor-in-chief of Le Monde, wrote in a rare front-page 
<br>editorial on July 26: "Stories abound of the young, born in 
<br>our 'cites,' that incomprehensibly swung from complete 
<br>integration to marginalization to then becoming 
<br>irretrievable." Guillaume Bigot, a French researcher who 
<br>recently co-wrote a well-reviewed book on Islamic extremism 
<br>in France, is even more biting: "The Muslim community in 
<br>France...is massively excluded at the social and economic 
<br>level, and is accustomed to a sense of humiliation. These 
<br>youth, whose first or last names become obstacles to finding 
<br>work, do not have a past or a feeling of belonging to a land, 
<br>and have absolutely no future. It is not necessary to invent 
<br>a James Bond of Islamist extremism. You only need people who 
<br>can be manipulated with a simplistic ideology." 
<br>
<br>¶11. (SBU) Poloffs recently visited the northern Paris suburb 
<br>of La Courneuve, which has recently become a living metaphor 
<br>for violence and Islamic extremism in France. Interior 
<br>Minister Sarkozy visited La Courneuve several times over the 
<br>past months, and has vowed to make it an example of his new 
<br>efforts to foster integration. Members of the "Chechen" 
<br>network (see para 6) were arrested there in 2002 with 
<br>explosive material and the chemical agent ricin. Originally 
<br>a small town independent from Paris, La Courneuve now 
<br>features many large HLM (low-income housing projects). The 
<br>streets are relatively wide and empty, with little 
<br>street-level commerce aside from government services and 
<br>larger supermarkets. No one background dominated and we saw 
<br>no visible signs of an Islamic presence (we passed only one 
<br>synagogue and no mosques). The suburb did not feel 
<br>dangerous; instead it seemed more bleak and deserted than 
<br>anything else, as if everybody was inside their apartments or 
<br>out of town. Satellite dishes sprouted from many apartments. 
<br>The presence of planters with flowers and tree-lined 
<br>sidewalks gave the impression of a municipal government 
<br>trying to improve the area. Indeed, the local government's 
<br>slogan was "La Courneuve is inventing another future for 
<br>itself." Overall, and despite its terrible reputation, La 
<br>Courneuve looked to be a modest, multicultural place. Its 
<br>appearance confirmed what statistics report: the overwhelming 
<br>majority of Muslims in France (whether from Africa, the 
<br>Maghreb, or the newly converted) are moderate. The problem 
<br>lies with the one or two apartments that harbor Islamic 
<br>extremists hidden within the tens of thousands that do not. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Comment: As is widely recognized, the GOF wields a 
<br>muscular and effective counter-terrorism apparatus that 
<br>identifies potential terrorists and thwarts potential 
<br>terrorist operations. Although there is always room for 
<br>improvement, the GOF appears to have done what it can in the 
<br>short- and medium-term to combat Islamic extremism. Over the 
<br>long-term, however, much work needs to be done. France does 
<br>not only have an integration/immigration problem; it must 
<br>also work to give a place to Muslims in the French identity. 
<br>Despite claims that its commitment to secularism nullifies 
<br>prejudice against any religion, it is an open secret that 
<br>historically Catholic France has heretofore failed to muster 
<br>sufficient will and understanding to truly accept Muslims as 
<br>French citizens. Although Islamic extremism may never 
<br>completely disappear from France, acceptance of Muslims as 
<br>full, participating members of French society will go a long 
<br>way to minimizing its reach. End comment.
