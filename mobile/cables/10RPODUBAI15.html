<br>SUBJECT: IRAN DOMESTIC POLITICS: 'FROM CRISIS TO STALEMATE' (2/3) 
<br> 
<br>CLASSIFIED BY: Alan Eyre, Director, DOS, IRPO; REASON: 1.4(B), (D) 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY:  At this point the Green Path Opposition (GPO) is 
<br>more of a persistent problem for the regime than an existential 
<br>threat, and it is unrealistic to assume that the GPO will be able 
<br>to effect any 'regime change' in the short-term.  Iran's ruling 
<br>regime is likely to continue seeing increased violence and 
<br>suppression as its most effective tool, including in the build-up 
<br>to mid- February anniversary of the Revolution and the opposition's 
<br>next planned protests.   However it is unlikely be able to 
<br>eliminate the GPO, which will continue trying to co-opt public 
<br>holidays to stage anti-regime protests and also try to increase 
<br>divisions among regime elite.  Although subsets of the GPO are 
<br>radicalizing, there is no reason to assume that GPO elements 
<br>seeking to fundamentally change the system represent most Iranians. 
<br>The GPO does not mirror the widespread an varied opposition that 
<br>overturned the Shah thirty years ago, and the standoff now is 
<br>increasingly becoming a stalemate that (inter alia) imperils the 
<br>IRIG's ability to engage with the West.  Until a new homeostasis is 
<br>reached in Iran's political ruling class, progress on issues of 
<br>bilateral importance will be even more difficult than usual.  END 
<br>SUMMARY. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (U) NOTE: This is the second in a series of cables examining 
<br>the Iranian opposition since the June 12 Presidential election, 
<br>what might happen in the short-term, and what the most effective 
<br>levers of US policy have been so far and what combination may have 
<br>the most impact in the coming months. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>ON THIS SIDE: REGIME 
<br> 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) Iran's current leadership sees the GPO with its periodic 
<br>street demonstrations more as a persistent problem than as an 
<br>existential threat. Ideology and personal experience have taught 
<br>regime hard-liners to equate compromise under pressure with 
<br>weakness. Supreme Leader Khamenei (SLK) himself is said to believe 
<br>that the Shah's fatal mistake, and the reason the Revolution 
<br>succeeded, was because the Shah 'retreated,' in addition to 
<br>believing that the USSR's fall was due to the same reasons. As 
<br>such, the regime can be expected to remain committed to using force 
<br>and repression against the GPO as necessary to both incapacitate 
<br>its first- and second-tier leadership (primarily through detention) 
<br>and its rank and file (through detention and violence, to include 
<br>deadly force). 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) Opposition activists have told IRPO that at least part of 
<br>the regime strategy is a pre-emptive 'rolling round-up' of not just 
<br>active GPO elements but also sympathizers. Thus in addition to 
<br>those it identifies as participating in GPO activities, the regime 
<br>goes after reformist reporters, feminists, human rights advocates, 
<br>labor organizers, ageing 'National Front' sympathizers, 'Second of 
<br>Khordad' Khatami-era reformists who are not active in the GPO 
<br>movement. According to some foreign-based GPO leaders, informed 
<br>estimates indicate approximately 2,000 people have been thus far 
<br>detained. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) Indications are that the regime is laying the groundwork for 
<br>using even more violence, to include the broader use of lethal 
<br>force at the popular level if necessary. This could include 
<br>executions of those found guilty of 'warring against God,' a term 
<br>which the regime is prone to define somewhat expansively. And while 
<br>there is certainly a limit to the regime's willingness to use 
<br>violence against its own people, there are no indications that it 
<br>is anywhere near it. One former IRGC officer told an Iranwatcher 
<br>that the IRGC wants to avoid killing more than a 'few dozen' 
<br>protestors in any one location on any one day, partially to avoid 
<br>associations with 'Black Friday' -September 8, 1978 - when mass 
<br>fatalities in a demonstration turned many against the Shah).  The 
<br>Ashura-day murder of Mousavi's nephew, in addition to the January 7 
<br>incident where security officials seemed to have coordinated shots 
<br>being fired at a car carrying Karrubi indicate a regime intent to 
<br> 
<br>DUBAI 00000015  002 OF 006 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>calibrate its level of violence to intimidate the opposition and 
<br>its leadership. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) The media press environment is also expected to become far 
<br>more restrictive, with one prominent reformist newsman telling IRPO 
<br>that he expects all reformist papers to be shut down in the 
<br>short-term. The regime continues to block 'subversive' websites, 
<br>while also stepping up it jamming of satellite broadcasts from both 
<br>VOA and BBC. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) In addition to its familiar tools of force and repression, 
<br>the regime also occasionally feints toward reconciliation, issuing 
<br>statements counseling moderation and offering up an occasional 
<br>scapegoat, such as the recent Majlis report blaming former Tehran 
<br>Prosecutor General Mortazavi for the detainee deaths at the 
<br>Kahrizak detention center.  In the public thrust and parry over 
<br>post-June 12 events one regime voice conspicuous by its absence has 
<br>been that of President Ahmadinejad, who has largely kept silent. 
<br>This strategy has drawn criticism by some fellow hard-liners, who 
<br>fault him for his unwillingness to publicly endorse harsh measures 
<br>against the GPO. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (C)  According to GPO expatriate leaders and other sources, the 
<br>ruling regime can be seen as composed of three groups, with 
<br>Khamenei still exercising control: 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>- relative moderates, such as Ali Larijani and Ahmad Tavakolli in 
<br>the Majlis, and Asghar Hejazi, former Foreign Minister Velayati and 
<br>former Majlis Speaker Nateq-Nuri all in the Supreme Leader's 
<br>office. This group seeks to have SLK cease his active support of 
<br>Ahmadinejad so that he can be removed by the Majlis; 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>-hardliners, such as IRGC Intelligence Head Hossein Taeb, 
<br>Khameneni's son Mojtaba, Basij Commander BG Mohammad Reza Naqdi, 
<br>Ayatollah Mesbah Yazdi, and Ahmadinejad and his own crowd. This 
<br>group seeks increased use of force, to include lethal force, on the 
<br>GPO and its leaders; 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>-  a middle way 'swing' group, composed of SLK himself, his two 
<br>sons Mostafa and Maysam, and some intelligence officials. This 
<br>group seeks a middle course between the two above, favoring 
<br>imprisoning, beating but not mass killing of protestors, and house 
<br>arrest and intimidation but not arrest and/or execution of GPO 
<br>leaders. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>ON THIS SIDE: GPO 
<br> 
<br>------------------------- 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C) Going forward, the GPO seems committed to using public 
<br>holidays as a show of strength and support, with the next big GPO 
<br>planned demonstration being the anniversary of the Revolution's 
<br>victory on  February 11 (22 Bahman). According to at least one 
<br>prominent GPO activist based abroad, the GPO leadership has a 
<br>three-part strategy: 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>- (1)  Maintaining GPO unity while also 'growing' and training its 
<br>numbers, expanding both geographically and in its constituent 
<br>class/demographic/ethnic elements. Public street gatherings on key 
<br>dates are one way of showing solidarity, as are slogans from 
<br>rooftops, work slowdowns, and other non-violent 'political 
<br>actions.' It will also seek to expand its use of 'blitz' 
<br>demonstrations, i.e. rapid assembly and dispersal of protestors, in 
<br> 
<br>DUBAI 00000015  003 OF 006 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>addition to university demonstrations and other forms of protest. 
<br>In this regard it seeks to strengthen links with Iran's labor 
<br>force, many of whom have a tradition of striking over non-payment 
<br>of wages.  (NOTE: The GPO's diffuse structure, and constant regime 
<br>pressure, will make implementing better organization and training 
<br>difficult in the short-term). 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>- (2) Creating divisions within the ruling elite, by 'peeling off' 
<br>the moderates around Khamenei. Mousavi's recent statement in which 
<br>he tacitly accepted the legitimacy of the Ahmadinejad government 
<br>was a step in this direction. Second of Khordad 'theoretician' Said 
<br>Hajjarian used to speak of the tactic of 'pressure from below, 
<br>negotiations from above' as the reformist strategy, and at least 
<br>some GPO strategists hope that elite pressure from moderate 
<br>conservatives dismayed at ongoing popular protests will seek to 
<br>convince SLK to cease his active support of Ahmadinejad, at which 
<br>point he will be subject to possibly politically fatal attacks from 
<br>the Majlis due to (inter alia) his financial mismanagement.  These 
<br>GPO strategists, who curiously also see regime compromise as a sign 
<br>of weakness, see Supreme Leader Khamenei's 'throwing Ahmadinejad 
<br>under the bus' as the first step to ultimately bringing down 
<br>Supreme Leader Khamenei himself 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>- (3) Continuing non-violent efforts to 'paralyze' the government, 
<br>largely through boycotts of IRGC affiliated companies, through work 
<br>slowdowns, and ultimately through strikes.  Some within the GPO see 
<br>the December 27 Ashura demonstrations as equivalent to the 17 
<br>Shahrivar demonstrations during the Revolution, after which the 
<br>people slowly 'lost their fear' of the Shah's machinery of 
<br>repression.  However, even the most optimistic GPO leaders 
<br>acknowledge the movement needs significantly more organization and 
<br>training before it is able to engage in larger anti-regime 
<br>activities (NOTE: Another advantage of a non-violent strategy is 
<br>that such non-violent protests are technically authorized by 
<br>Article 27 of the Constitution.  As such, any move to anti-regime 
<br>violence would represent not just an escalation in the likely 
<br>overall level of violence, but a move from inter-Constitutional to 
<br>extra-Constitutional opposition). 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (C) This 3-part strategy, as articulated by a GPO leader based 
<br>abroad, in many respects depends on the willingness of the mass 
<br>movement of the GPO for support; whether it has been embraced by 
<br>the popular elements of the GPO opposition is unclear. 
<br>Furthermore, the increasing radicalization of popular elements 
<br>within the GPO potentially undermines this strategy and at the very 
<br>least makes near-term predictions less reliable.  An opposition 
<br>that increasingly responds to regime violence with its own violence 
<br>gives the regime greater license to increase repression even 
<br>further, creating an unpredictable cycle of violence coupled with 
<br>greater disillusionment with the regime. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (C) MEDIA AND CYBERSPACE: The regime and GPO clash not just in 
<br>the streets but also in cyberspace, and the GPO can be expected to 
<br>expand its efforts to create a virtual space in which it can 
<br>disseminate information to Iranians inside Iran.  It continues to 
<br>spend significant energies on circumventing Iranian attempts to 
<br>monitor, control and block Internet access in Iran, and is 
<br>exploring the possibility of providing satellite high-speed 
<br>internet access, although funding is the main barrier.  In 
<br>conventional media, expatriate GPO activists have told IRPO that 
<br>while in the short-term GPO is forced to rely on satellite TV such 
<br>as VOA and BBC to get oppositionist news into Iran, it is seeking 
<br>to create its own news fora, to include its own satellite 
<br>television broadcast. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>NO 2ND REVOLUTION 
<br> 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>DUBAI 00000015  004 OF 006 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (C)  No one knows or can know what will happen next.  While 
<br>Iran is not North Korea, since June 12 and the subsequent crackdown 
<br>it has become harder to follow significant events there, both at 
<br>the popular and elite level. Foreign media presence has been 
<br>severely curtailed and domestic media is increasingly censored. And 
<br>Iran's hardline intelligence-security cabal's 'soft overthrow' 
<br>fixation has reduced the number and type of Iranians willing to 
<br>talk frankly to the press (and to Iranwatchers) about domestic 
<br>events. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶13.  (C) Against that backdrop one must note the 'selective 
<br>perception' bias that tends to over-emphasize the GPO's potency. 
<br>Some pro-GPO bias stems from their being the (relative) 'good guys' 
<br>in this drama, to the extent that their agenda encompasses 
<br>principles dear to Western democracies.  Additionally, Western 
<br>media's Iran contacts tend to be pro-reformist, with Western press 
<br>quoting pro-GPO activists and analysts almost exclusively. Also USG 
<br>officials' interactions with Iranians tend to be largely limited to 
<br>Iranians willing and able to talk with us, with a disproportionate 
<br>number of them being those seeking USG assistance in helping fight 
<br>the regime. Finally and in many ways most importantly 'if it bleeds 
<br>it leads,' so there are no 'Youtube' uploads on demonstration days 
<br>of the millions of ordinary Iranians who are going about their 
<br>business. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶14. (C) In this regard, many IRPO interlocutors comment that for 
<br>most in Tehran, life is going on as normal, with no sensation of 
<br>living in 'a police state' (except on the key dates targeted by the 
<br>GPO, and only then for people in specific areas where clashes 
<br>occur).   In other words, it seems that the vast majority of 
<br>Iranians, though more critical of the government to greater or 
<br>lesser degrees, are continuing to live their lives as normal. 
<br>There is no reason to assume that those 'radical' GPO elements 
<br>seeking to fundamentally change the system represent most Iranians. 
<br>At most, it appears that many and possibly most Iranians want a 
<br>peaceful reform of the system as opposed to another revolution with 
<br>an uncertain outcome. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶15. (C) Having stipulated that no one can assert with confidence 
<br>what will happen in Iran's domestic situation over the next year, 
<br>it does seem that, as expatriate Iranian oppositionist Ibrahim 
<br>Nabavi has written, Iran is moving 'from crisis to stalemate.'  The 
<br>clash between Iran's government hardliners and the GPO is unlikely 
<br>to end decisively to the benefit of either side within the 
<br>short-term, and it is quite improbable  that in the short-term the 
<br>GPO will in some decisive way 'defeat' the Khamenei regime and 
<br>change Iran's theocracy into a secular republic. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶16.  (C) In terms of the significant metrics by which can judge the 
<br>course of future events, some of the ones significant both in 
<br>1977-79 and now include the following: 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>- Numbers: The numbers of protestors willing to take to the streets 
<br>now is an order of magnitude smaller than in 78-79. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>- Classes: the GPO as currently constituted doesn't seem to have a 
<br>significant ethnic or labor component, and doesn't seem to have 
<br>'broken out' of Tehran in a significant way to other major urban 
<br>centers, though we recognize that our awareness of developments 
<br>outside of Tehran is likely to be more limited. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>- Anti-Gov't Activities: Unlike 1979, there have been no paralyzing 
<br>strikes, bazaar closings, military defections, or signs of the 
<br>government ceasing to function. Whereas the bazaar merchants in 
<br>1979 had the inclination and money to fund striking workers 
<br>deprived of pay, the there seems to be no such GPO 'deep pockets.' 
<br>Indeed both elements of the 'bazaar-mosque' alliance that were in 
<br> 
<br>DUBAI 00000015  005 OF 006 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>many ways the backbone of the 1979 Revolution are singularly absent 
<br>in today's opposition, as each has been largely co-opted by the 
<br>government.  There have been no indications that Rafsanjani and the 
<br>Servants of Construction or Qalibaf's Tehran Municipality are 
<br>currently a significant GPO funding source.  On a far more limited 
<br>scale, expatriate 'Second of Khordad' Reformist elements within the 
<br>Iranian Diaspora are leading efforts to create a fund for the 
<br>support of detainee families. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>- Elite Defection/Emigration: Those hardliners who constitute and 
<br>support the regime are very likely to remain committed to the fight 
<br>against the GPO, since they know they would have no role in any new 
<br>order and would also have nowhere else to go.  However for the GPO, 
<br>many reformists and oppositionists dissatisfied with Iran's plight 
<br>would rather quit then fight, as shown by the ongoing brain drain, 
<br>to include increased exodus of political activists.  Anecdotal 
<br>information shows that many of larger numbers of affluent and 
<br>educated Iranians who can be presumed to be oppose the hardliners 
<br>are taking their families and fortunes abroad. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶17. (C) Although much GPO animus has transferred from Ahmadinejad 
<br>to SLK, it can be assumed that at least part of the movement's 
<br>support would fade were Ahmadinejad to be replaced by someone less 
<br>controversial and better equipped to successfully govern. Although 
<br>SLK has shown that he prefers suppression to compromise, at some 
<br>point pressure at the elite level might persuade him to abandon or 
<br>marginalize Ahmadinejad.  Granted, the subsequent Presidential 
<br>election could provide another spark for future protests, but the 
<br>point here is that at both at the popular and elite level, at least 
<br>some oppositionist fervor is still fixated on Ahmadinejad, and 
<br>would presumably dissipate with his dismissal. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>STALEMATE TO CONTINUE 
<br> 
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶18. (C) The IRIG's decision-making process, multi-polar and messy 
<br>even before this turmoil, has been further strained by the battle 
<br>between the regime and the GPO as well as by the animosity toward 
<br>Ahmadinejad from within the regime.  For example, domestic 
<br>political opposition torpedoed Khamenei and Ahmadinejad's ability 
<br>to sell the IAEA's Tehran Research Reactor agreement.  Subsidy 
<br>reform, the most important piece of domestic legislation in years, 
<br>was passed only after a protracted political cage fight between 
<br>Ahmadinejad and the Majlis.   Amid the IRIG-GPO stalemate and the 
<br>accompanying factionalization in the conservative 'Principalist' 
<br>camp, Iran will be hard pressed achieve consensus and move forward 
<br>on issues relevant to the USG. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶19. (C) As one US-based IRPO contact noted, only one thing is 
<br>certain, namely uncertainty over how the contest will play out.  It 
<br>is clear neither regime leaders nor opposition figures are 
<br>convinced of the path ahead and they are constantly recalibrating 
<br>and shifting positions.  Moreover, he added, there is hesitancy on 
<br>the part of all actors to move decisively.  He noted that this was 
<br>visible in the regime's unwillingness to use the full force of its 
<br>repressive capabilities to crack down on the opposition once and 
<br>for all. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶20. (C) COMMENT: The GPO is not Poland's Solidarity, and Tehran 
<br>2010 isn't Tehran 1978.  In other words, it is quite unlikely that 
<br>the current Iranian system of government will significantly change 
<br>in the short-term, and if there were any significant change, it is 
<br>more likely to be towards a more authoritarian regime than to be 
<br>towards a more democratic one.   However, having posited why the 
<br>GPO is unlikely to effect fundamental short-term changes in Iran's 
<br>ruling system, it is equally true to say that it is unlikely to go 
<br>away. What makes the preceding important for the USG is the fact 
<br>that Iran's current domestic strife is a political 'black hole' 
<br> 
<br>DUBAI 00000015  006 OF 006 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>that swallows all other issues, both domestic and foreign, such 
<br>that until a new homeostasis is reached in Iran's political ruling 
<br>class, progress on issues of bilateral importance will be even more 
<br>difficult than usual.  END COMMENT.
