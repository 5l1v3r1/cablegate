<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: The rise of corporate statism in Russia has 
<br>been significant. Since 2004, the government has taken over 
<br>the world's largest titanium business, consolidated its 
<br>position in Gazprom, merged 10 aviation businesses into a 
<br>state-owned conglomerate, and taken controlling positions in 
<br>other firms. No less fascinating has been the mix of greed, 
<br>politics, and business behind the expansion of the state into 
<br>the economy. Looking ahead, our contacts are strongly 
<br>divided. Some see troubling signs of continued state 
<br>ambition. Others believe the process is essentially 
<br>plateauing, and will stabilize at lower levels of state 
<br>ownership in the economy after two-three years. In our view, 
<br>the current trendline may quickly approach some rather 
<br>natural limits, and the Kremlin will eventually have to bow 
<br>to the market. In the meantime, we should reinforce 
<br>market-driven approaches and the cadre of Russian 
<br>policy-makers who doggedly keep these ideas in play. End 
<br>Summary. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) This cable is based on dozens of conversations with 
<br>contacts in industry and banking over the past six weeks, 
<br>supplemented by Embassy-based research. 
<br>
<br>The Breadth of State Ownership 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) The march of the state into parts of the Russian 
<br>economy over the past few years has been significant, with 
<br>control of swaths of the natural resource, defense, and 
<br>select other sectors consolidated in state hands. Annual 
<br>revenues of Russia's ten largest state-owned or controlled 
<br>companies reached an estimated 20 percent of GDP in 2006. 
<br>State-owned or controlled companies account for one-third of 
<br>the Russian stock market's capitalization, and in just the 
<br>last year, the value of these equity holdings has almost 
<br>doubled to an estimated USD 369 billion. And the process 
<br>continues: Rosoboronexport is rumored to be in line to buy 
<br>Russia's fifth largest steel producer, Mechel; further 
<br>consolidation in the energy sector favoring Gazprom and 
<br>Rosneft is likely; a new shipbuilding national champion is in 
<br>the works; and diamond giant Alrosa has its eye on Norilsk 
<br>Nickel, a USD 30 billion company with more than the half the 
<br>world's palladium and one-fifth of global nickel output. 
<br>
<br>Looking Behind This Latest Great Grab 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) The grab for Russia's resources is an old story, but 
<br>contacts agree that traditional motives (greed, power) have 
<br>been supplemented in this round with a nationalistic brand of 
<br>commercial considerations. Greed in Russia shocks no one, 
<br>but the rising value of Russia, Inc. (on the back of high 
<br>energy prices) has made the current grab particularly 
<br>profitable for some. Power considerations -- both 
<br>geopolitical (as in the case of Gazprom) and in the context 
<br>of Russia's domestic succession process -- are evident as 
<br>well. New to this paradigm is the surprisingly strong role 
<br>business considerations seem to be playing -- as the Russian 
<br>Government tries to salvage a select few decrepit remains of 
<br>Soviet industrial prowess before it is too late. Our 
<br>contacts have a lot to say about all three motives; we 
<br>summarize what we've heard here. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Greed: The Kremlin leadership in the economy is in no 
<br>small part about money, and the Sibneft takeover by Gazprom 
<br>is perhaps the most blatant example of this (only about a 
<br>quarter of the $12b selling price for the firm is said to 
<br>have actually gone to owner Abramovich). In general, the 
<br>insider offtake from M&A deal flows is said to be so large 
<br>now that Swiss banks have told Kremlin cutouts (like 
<br>gas-trader Timchenko) that they cannot accept further 
<br>deposits without knowing the source of the money. The most 
<br>lucrative transfers to the state (usually involving natural 
<br>resources) may be wrapped in patriotic rhetoric, but include 
<br>a healthy dose of financial opportunism. Yet, as ugly as it 
<br>looks, our contacts remind, it is not so different than what 
<br>happened in Indonesia and South Korea - and Mexico too. As 
<br>one contact points out, "the bureaucrats got rich there too." 
<br>
<br>MOSCOW 00001442 002 OF 004 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Power: Creating national champions and projecting a 
<br>strong image for Russia abroad has been a leading factor in 
<br>many state-connected takeovers and consolidations, including 
<br>the removal of the Gazprom ring fence, the Rosoboronexport 
<br>makeover, the RUSAL-SUAL deal, and the anticipated takeover 
<br>of Norilsk Nickel by Alrosa. Some of what we are seeing is 
<br>also is part of the ongoing succession process, putting 
<br>individuals into deal flows and thus providing campaign 
<br>finance and enhancing their public profile. The decision to 
<br>put military hardware exports under Rosoboronexport is seen 
<br>in some quarters as buttressing dark horse presidential 
<br>hopeful and Rosoboronexport Chairman Sergey Chemezov. Recent 
<br>portfolio changes are seen by some as giving First Deputy 
<br>Prime Minister Sergey Ivanov a cash-laden institutional base 
<br>like that enjoyed by his chief rival for the presidency, 
<br>First Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration and 
<br>Gazprom Chairman of the Board of Directors Dmitriy Medvedev. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Nationalistic-Driven Commercial Considerations: Many 
<br>believe that Putin and those around him are also driven by a 
<br>sincere desire to right the excesses of the 1990s, or 
<br>oligarchic plundering of once-proud, though ruinously 
<br>inefficient, Soviet companies. The examples here are truly 
<br>varied. In the case of Avtovaz, Rosoboronexport's move to 
<br>take over the firm last year may be the only thing saving the 
<br>car-giant from complete collapse in the face of global 
<br>competition. The emerging Norilsk Nickel story is said to be 
<br>as much about saving Alrosa (which experts say will run out 
<br>of diamonds in ten years' time) as it is about keeping 
<br>Norilsk's palladium and nickel output in Russian hands. And, 
<br>as driven by national security concerns as the formation of 
<br>the United Aircraft Company might be, also at play is a 
<br>long-overdue consolidation of an industry largely on the 
<br>verge of collapse. These examples are more about saving jobs 
<br>and communities and creating viable competitive companies 
<br>than personal enrichment. Although making money is not 
<br>precluded here, both Avtovaz and UAC, not to mention plans to 
<br>create a new shipbuilding national champion, sound more like 
<br>cash sinks than cash cows. 
<br>
<br>What Next? 
<br>---------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Looking ahead, our contacts are divided about what to 
<br>expect next. "Statist" believers argue that there are 
<br>troubling signs that the trend is far from contained: 
<br>state-owned companies are straying farther from their core 
<br>business, eyeing the telecom and IT sectors, and expanding 
<br>beyond traditional financial services. They point to 
<br>Gazprom's movement into electricity; Svyazinvest's 
<br>significant stake in privately-held telecom provider Comstar; 
<br>and VneshTorgBank's overtures to brokerage house Troika 
<br>Dialog (ultimately rebuffed). While no one is predicting 
<br>another Yukos-style approach, there is a sense that the 
<br>authorities can and will come up with new pretexts for 
<br>control. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) In contrast, others argue the state's reach is 
<br>plateauing, and the current mix of state-private ownership 
<br>could start to reverse itself before long. They say national 
<br>champions in the sectors that make sense have been created, 
<br>and industries such as telecom and IT do not lend themselves 
<br>to over-centralization. In gas and electricity, given supply 
<br>shortfalls, the GOR has to promote private investment to meet 
<br>demand and introduce efficiencies. A shrinking current 
<br>account balance (on the back of lower oil prices) and the 
<br>drive to diversify the economy only heighten the need for 
<br>private capital and better corporate governance (which 
<br>implies a move away from state ownership and control). The 
<br>Kremlin will also find it increasingly difficult to control 
<br>emerging interest groups, from the consumer sector to 
<br>regional governments. Integration into the WTO and other 
<br>western economic institutions will require greater 
<br>transparency, better and more equal market access, and lower 
<br>protectionist barriers - which will temper the state's 
<br>ambition. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Some take this latter argument one dark step further. 
<br>They say that current GOR leadership, its successors and 
<br>supporters, will need to find outlets for their accumulated 
<br>wealth, much of which is said to be held in liquid assets 
<br>abroad. The theory goes that these funds will start making 
<br>their way back to Russia over the next two-three years, and 
<br>that the target of the return flows will most likely be the 
<br>
<br>MOSCOW 00001442 003 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>same assets that have been carefully squirreled away in state 
<br>hands over the past few years -- thus spurring share 
<br>offerings by Rosneft, spin offs at Gazprom, etc. These 
<br>assets are profitable, and equity ownership in Russia carries 
<br>less risk for this particular group of investors than the 
<br>prying eyes of regulatory authorities abroad. Likewise, 
<br>coming into Russia from an European investment platform, as 
<br>one contact cynically noted, may make it less likely that 
<br>zealous law-enforcement officials abroad would pursue 
<br>criminal or civil cases for fear a U.S. or European firm 
<br>could get tangled up in the investigation. 
<br>
<br>Where We Come Out 
<br>----------------- 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Looking at the three motives most obviously at play, 
<br>two of them -- greed and nationalistic commercial 
<br>considerations -- suggest equally valid reasons why we might 
<br>see the state pulling back from its commanding heights over 
<br>the next few years. Greed will tend to push those who have 
<br>accumulated shares in state companies towards share 
<br>cash-outs, just as it will push those who have accumulated 
<br>"private" cash abroad to buy back into Russia's safest 
<br>investments. Rosneft is a perfect example. We are watching 
<br>to see who in the government argues the loudest for Rosneft's 
<br>further privatization -- they more than likely stand to 
<br>benefit from either the sell or the buy opportunity. For 
<br>industries that are less obvious moneymakers, exemplified by 
<br>Avtovaz and UAC, the state is even more likely to divest 
<br>(wholly, in the case of Avtovaz) as the firms become 
<br>commercially viable and need investment capital and strategic 
<br>partners, and as they become less social land mines and 
<br>resemble more the typical day-to-day slog of the business 
<br>world. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) But pulling back does not mean exiting the field. 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX does not expect the state  ever to
<br>relinquish its control of XXXXXXXXXXXX. Nor will the
<br>GOR  allow its stake in Gazprom to drop again below 50%,
<br>although  many predict it will shed non-core assets in the
<br>coming  years. Nor will the diamond trade or trade in metals
<br>likely  see a repeat of the halcyon days of private ownership
<br>in the  wake of loans-for-shares. UAC will likely never be
<br>more than  30% privately-owned. 
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) But even if every firm in the natural resources 
<br>sector ends up in state hands, as significant as that would 
<br>be, it would account for around 12% of the Russian economy. 
<br>Add in state monopolies in the transport and communications 
<br>sector, defense industries, and space, and state control over 
<br>the economy rings in around 25% of GDP. As disturbing as 
<br>this figure might seem, it is not wildly out of line with 
<br>other market economies rich in natural resources. As 
<br>recently as two years ago, the Norwegian state owned 
<br>approximately 32% of the companies listed on the Oslo Stock 
<br>Exchange, and still holds shares in 10-15 percent of 
<br>Norwegian industry, including controlling shares in oil, 
<br>telecoms, and the national airline. In Mexico, the state 
<br>fully controls the oil, gas, and nuclear power industries and 
<br>has reserved for the state in whole or part the 
<br>telecommunications, air travel, and postal sectors. 
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) And these back of the envelope estimates ignore 
<br>important counter trends to the movement toward greater state 
<br>control. Whole swaths of the economy, our interlocutors 
<br>again and again confirm, lie fully outside the ambitions of 
<br>the state -- and are thriving. One seasoned businessman (who 
<br>has had his hat handed to him on more than one occasion over 
<br>the past 15 years) is back in Russia and growing fast, and he 
<br>chalks up his current success to the booming service and 
<br>retail sector, a place where he says he never comes in 
<br>contact with the designs of the Kremlin. There are also 
<br>instances, like with XXXXXXXXXXXX, where, despite the
<br>new ownership 
<br>structure, the state has left the firm to run the business 
<br>without Rosoboronexport grabbing off profits or instructing 
<br>where production should go. Lastly, it would be 
<br>irresponsible to ignore the progress being made toward the 
<br>break-up and privatization of both the electricity and rail 
<br>sectors. When all is said and done, these massive reforms 
<br>will move some 2-3 percent of GDP from state to private hands. 
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) There is another reason why more of this economy
<br>will  likely move into the private sector. Economic
<br>modernizers,  as they have come to call themselves here, may still 
<br>
<br>MOSCOW 00001442 004 OF 004 
<br>
<br>ultimately get the upper hand. XXXXXXXXXXXX, 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXXXX and  others
<br>recognize that only through greater private sector 
<br>participation in the economy will Russia be able to attract 
<br>the capital needed to sustain growth over the long run. This 
<br>is also where working to bring Russia into international 
<br>institutions will help drive policy here in the direction we 
<br>favor. Locking the Russian Government into such institutions 
<br>and exposing Russian companies to the discipline of the 
<br>global market will reinforce the trends we seek to encourage. 
<br>Doing so this year, before the election process starts to 
<br>create new winners and losers, is a bet on the modernizers 
<br>worth taking.<br>
