<br>PROGRAMS
<br>
<br>Classified By: Charge d'Affaires Sylvia Reed Curran. Reasons 1.4(b) an
<br>d (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) An Iranian specialist in the treatment of drug
<br>addiction spoke to Iran Watcher this week about medical and
<br>legal approaches to the problem in Iran. xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>(please protect), xxxxxxxxxxxx contrasted Turkmenstan's punitie and
<br>abstinence-based, rather than treatment-oriented, stance
<br>towards drug abusers with that of Iran. There, he said,
<br>criminal laws governing drug use have evolved significantly
<br>in the xxxxxxxxxxxx years he has been working in the
<br>field of addiction. In the 1980s, Iran's penal code imposed
<br>harsh sentences on narcotics users, but began to change in
<br>the 90s. This was due in part, he said, to the input of
<br>experts like himself who emphasized the effectiveness of
<br>treatment over retributive justice. These days, drug users
<br>in Iran who are actively seeking treatment are not subject to
<br>criminal penalties.
<br>
<br>Narcotics anonymous: 50,000 members
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx said that about 20 years ago, three young
<br>Iranians, recovering drug abusers, returned from long
<br>residences in the U.S. and started a branch of Narcotics
<br>Anonymous. Since then, it has grown to an organization of
<br>50,000 members with branches that hold regular meetings
<br>throughout the country. He added that drug use in Iran is a
<br>long-standing problem, dating back several hundred years, and
<br>that it knows no particular socio-economic boundaries. He
<br>cited depression as the most common reason that Iranians
<br>abuse mood altering substances. Despite a significant drug
<br>abuse problem in the country, Iranians actually use (though
<br>do not necessarily abuse) alcohol much more than they do
<br>drugs. In his view, there is a portion of these suffers from
<br>depression that does not respond successfully to therapy and
<br>will always seek mood altering substances. They account for
<br>the 150,000 Iranians who receive regular,
<br>government-sanctioned doses of methadone.
<br>
<br>The success of twelve-step programs
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) According to xxxxxxxxxxxx twelve-step
<br>programs have been highly successful in treating drug
<br>dependent Iranians, in sharp contrast to other Muslim
<br>countries, such as Egypt and others in the Middle East. He
<br>attributes this to the comfort that Iranians feel culturally
<br>with the tenets of the program, particularly the concept of
<br>"evil." Whereas in Islam, evil is considered to be "a
<br>creation of God that must be eradicated," he said that
<br>Zoroastrianism, the ancient religion of Iran, in contrast,
<br>acknowledges evil as a normal component of human nature that
<br>can be acknowledged and overcome.
<br>
<br>Recent problems...
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx noted that the ambassador
<br>to the UN was later also relieved of his position and is back
<br>in Iran, with no promise of another government job. He
<br>frequently sees him strolling through a local mall in Tehran.
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx, says he gets
<br>"a lot of support" from xxxxxxxxxxxx. "If it weren't for
<br>
<br>Ashgabat 00000245 002 of 002
<br>
<br>
<br>him," he said, "I would probably have lost my job long ago."
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) COMMENT: Our interlocutor has devoted his career to
<br>learning about and treating drug addiction. xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>He said that, despite the recent
<br>setbacks and problems he has encountered, there is nothing
<br>else he would rather be doing. "The key," he said, "is
<br>learning to treat those who are drug dependent with
<br>compassion and humanity." END COMMENT
