<br>SUMMARY 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶1.   (C) Support within Chancellor Merkel,s partner 
<br>Christian Social Union (CSU) for sending more German troops 
<br>to Afghanistan is not a sure thing.  CSU chief and Bavarian 
<br>Minister President  Seehofer, rattled German policy makers 
<br>nationwide when he told Bild on December 7 that he had 
<br>"little sympathy" for increasing the number of German 
<br>soldiers sent to Afghanistan and that "someone would have to 
<br>convince him of a clear alternative" and "any further German 
<br>engagement had to be linked to a clear exit strategy."  CSU 
<br>insiders privately regretted Seehofer's remarks, but the CSU 
<br>General Secretary told us that it reflected realistic 
<br>thinking.  Edmund Stoiber (ex-CSU chairman and ex-Minister 
<br>President) acknowledged December 10 that the CSU was not 
<br>automatically a firm U.S. ally on this question but said he 
<br>expected all federal coalition parties to "live up to their 
<br>responsibility" and take the right decision following the 
<br>January 28 Afghanistan conference.  However, if he is wrong 
<br>and there are significant defectors in either the CSU or the 
<br>FDP, it will be difficult for even supportive SPD and Green 
<br>parliamentarians to vote in favor of the revised mandate. 
<br>End Summary. 
<br> 
<br>SEEHOFER MIGHT ECHO POPULAR CONCERNS 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (C) Echoing concerns expressed privately by some 
<br>Consulate contacts, many commentators reacted badly to the 
<br>December 7 timing of Seehofer's skeptical Afghanistan 
<br>remarks.  They accused him of populist posturing while 
<br>Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, also CSU, was 
<br>under intense political pressure for the Kunduz tanker 
<br>bombing, Ambassador Holbrooke was in Germany to receive the 
<br>Augsburg University Peace Prize, and President Obama was 
<br>heading to Oslo to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. However, 
<br>others acknowledged that Seehofer reflected "proper concerns" 
<br>and that Germany "needed to deliberate as carefully as the 
<br>U.S. had done before committing new troops."  State 
<br>Chancellery and Ministry officials, including the State 
<br>Secretary for Federal and European Issues, told the Consul 
<br>General in a private meeting on December 8 they were 
<br>"embarrassed by Seehofer's remarks" and suggested he had 
<br>reacted "like a populist" to recent opinion polls that showed 
<br>69 percent of Germans opposed sending more German soldiers to 
<br>Afghanistan.  (NOTE: Another recent poll reported that 69 
<br>percent favored immediate withdrawal.)  A CSU contact called 
<br>us that same morning from party headquarters to express his 
<br>frustration over Seehofer who had "once again not consulted 
<br>anybody before giving his two cents."  In contrast to this, 
<br>CSU Secretary General Alexander Dobrindt told CG Tribble on 
<br>December 8 that Seehofer's statement was by no means new but 
<br>reflected "common CSU thinking."  Seehofer had "said this 
<br>many times before," he insisted, without producing proof. 
<br> 
<br>AFGHAN ENTANGLEMENTS SPOOK THE CSU 
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C) The CSU and Bavaria have a well-documented aversion 
<br>to sensitive engagements in Afghanistan.  The CSU has refused 
<br>to accept any of the 17 Uighurs to be released from 
<br>Guantanamo, even though Munich is home to an estimated 500 
<br>Uighurs, the largest Uigher community in Germany.  Bavaria 
<br>resisted for over a year all entreaties to send police 
<br>trainers to Afghanistan; the  first Bavarian police trainers 
<br>just left in November after a change of heart by the Interior 
<br>Minister.  CSU Bundestag deputy Peter Gauweiler, together 
<br>with his CDU colleague Willy Wimmer, appealed to the Federal 
<br>Constitutional Court in March 2007 to rule against German 
<br>Tornado reconnaissance aircraft "assisting the U.S. in a 
<br>mission in Afghanistan that was violating international law." 
<br>In October 2008, Gauweiler again voted against German ISAF 
<br> 
<br>MUNICH 00000328  002 OF 002 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>engagement.  While Gauweiler is generally seen as an outsider 
<br>within the CSU party caucus, he may have some secret 
<br>followers.  Another CSU Bundestag deputy, Thomas Silberhorn, 
<br>said in October that the debate on Afghanistan "should not be 
<br>limited to discussing more and more foreign soldiers but 
<br>rather appealing on Afghanistan's own responsibility." 
<br> 
<br>CHANCELLOR NEEDS TO WORK HARDER TO CONVINCE THE PUBLIC 
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------- 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (C) On December 10, Ambassador Murphy called on Edmund 
<br>Stoiber, Bavarian Minister President from 1993 to 2007 and 
<br>CSU party chairman from 1999 to 2007.  Stoiber praised the 
<br>new U.S. Administration and President Obama's "courageous and 
<br>honest" speeches in West Point and Oslo.  He reminded the 
<br>Ambassador how German engagement in and responsibility for 
<br>two world wars had "left marks of deep trauma on the German 
<br>people."  The largest demonstrations ever, he recalled, 
<br>occurred in the fifties when over one million Germans 
<br>protested German rearmament.  The decision to support the 
<br>NATO two-track decision in the early 1990,s even led to the 
<br>resignation of Helmut Schmidt, one of Germany's most popular 
<br>chancellors.  Stoiber said he did not expect any new insights 
<br>from the January 28 London Afghanistan conference, but he 
<br>expressed the hope that all parties of the federal government 
<br>coalition would live up to their responsibilities.  In order 
<br>to get broad CSU support, the leadership had to develop a 
<br>realistic exit strategy as President Obama had showed the way 
<br>with his 2011 target for the United States.  Stoiber said he 
<br>had much confidence in Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu 
<br>Guttenberg (CSU) who was politically well-connected, an 
<br>expert on foreign policy, and sensitive for what had to be 
<br>done.  However, he called on Chancellor Merkel to start a 
<br>"public relations initiative" aimed at explaining to the 
<br>German public why these operations were so vital for German 
<br>security interests.  At the same time, Stoiber predicted the 
<br>SPD and Greens would "return to their anti-war propaganda." 
<br>Leaders like Gerhard Schroeder and Joschka Fischer had left 
<br>the political scene, and ex-Foreign Minister Steinmeier was 
<br>about to get marginalized in the new SPD. 
<br> 
<br>COMMENT 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) At the Consulate in Munich, we heard unprompted, 
<br>mostly negative, reactions from CSU leadership and working 
<br>level operatives around Seehofer to his skeptical remarks 
<br>concerning Germany's Afghanistan troop levels.  However,  it 
<br>is clear that the CSU is on the fence and remains to be 
<br>convinced about the need or wisdom of sending additional 
<br>troops,  especially combat troops as opposed to troops sent 
<br>to train the Afghan National Army or to provide force 
<br>protection for police mentoring teams.  He may be accurately 
<br>reflecting the opinion of a skeptical German public that 
<br>"wants to take its time, just like the United States' 
<br>President did."  Embassy Berlin observes that unanimous or 
<br>near unanimous support from the CSU is critical to Chancellor 
<br>Merkel's goal of obtaining a broad majority in the Bundestag 
<br>for a revised ISAF mandate after the London Conference.  If 
<br>there are significant defectors in either the CSU or the FDP, 
<br>where there is also significant skepticism about a troop 
<br>increase, it will be difficult for even supportive SPD and 
<br>Green parliamentarians to vote in favor of the revised 
<br>mandate.

<br>¶6.  (U)  ConGen Munich and Embassy Berlin coordinated this 
<br>cable.
