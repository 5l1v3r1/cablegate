<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary. As Brazil takes an increasingly prominent 
<br>place on the international stage, its Foreign Ministry, known 
<br>widely as Itamaraty after its headquarters building, finds 
<br>itself under the influence of four powerful personalities 
<br>whose ideologies are shaping its foreign policy priorities 
<br>and interaction with the United States. Over the last six 
<br>years, President Lula's relatively pragmatic effort to expand 
<br>Brazil's outreach to a growing group of countries, including 
<br>the United States, has been implemented differently by the 
<br>GOB's three principal foreign policy actors: the nationalist 
<br>Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, the anti-American Secretary 
<br>General (deputy Foreign Minister) Samuel Pinheiro Guimaraes, 
<br>and the academic leftist presidential Foreign Policy Advisor 
<br>Marco Aurelio Garcia. Along with President Lula, the three 
<br>have pulled the Foreign Ministry in unaccustomed and 
<br>sometimes different directions. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) The departure of deputy FM Guimaraes in November 2009 
<br>and a new administration in January 2011 are likely to again 
<br>modify the GOB's foreign policy ideologies and priorities. 
<br>As we seek to broaden and deepen our relationship with 
<br>Itamaraty, ideological dynamics will make Itamaraty a 
<br>sometimes frustrating partner. Even so, the opportunity 
<br>exists now to move forward by working with other Brazilian 
<br>institutions, and to shape the views of a large cohort of 
<br>younger, more pragmatic, and more globally oriented diplomats 
<br>who will be moving into senior ranks. Para 16 contains two 
<br>proposals post is actively exploring. (Note: This is the 
<br>first of three cables examining the influences on Brazil's 
<br>Foreign Ministry. A second will report on the institutional 
<br>strains affecting Itamaraty. A third will examine the 
<br>inter-agency struggles that are slowly eroding Itamaraty's 
<br>foreign policy primacy; see also paras 13-14 below. End 
<br>note.) End summary.

<br>President Lula: The Pragmatic Leftist 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) President Lula arrived in office in 2003 with little 
<br>foreign affairs experience and a broadly leftist approach to 
<br>international affairs in which more developed countries stood 
<br>against less developed countries on the world stage. In 
<br>practice, however, Lula has demonstrated a gift for 
<br>personalizing foreign policy through contacts with foreign 
<br>leaders and a penchant for taking a pragmatic rather than an 
<br>ideological approach to working with other countries. As a 
<br>result, Lula has significantly shaped Brazil's foreign policy 
<br>efforts, as his good working relationships with leaders from 
<br>across the political spectrum have helped increase Brazilian 
<br>influence and standing, while paving the way for closer 
<br>cooperation between Brazil and a growing number of global 
<br>actors, including the United States. But there remains a 
<br>notable tension between Lula's actions and his rhetoric, 
<br>which often takes on a North-South, "us versus them" cast. 
<br>This tension keeps Itamaraty on edge, and has opened the door 
<br>for Amorim, Guimaraes, and Garcia to formulate and implement 
<br>Brazil's foreign policy in different ways.

<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Most analysts agree that Lula is not the principal 
<br>architect of his administration's foreign policy vision, nor 
<br>the principal overseer of its implementation. In this 
<br>regard, contacts almost universally cite FM Amorim, SG 
<br>Guimaraes, and Advisor Garcia as nearly co-equal with regard 
<br>to their influence in determining the broad outlines and 
<br>scope of Brazil's foreign policy. All three are leftist in 
<br>their basic ideology, but each has taken on a specific 
<br>leadership role, approaches his job with a different slant, 
<br>relates in a different manner to President Lula, and receives 
<br>support from a different base. Each has carved out his own 
<br>foreign policy niche: trade, developed country relations, 
<br>multilateral issues, Africa, and the Middle East for Amorim; 
<br>political-military issues, relations with some developing 
<br>countries, and Foreign Ministry inner workings for Guimaraes; 
<br>and South American and leftist countries in Latin America and 
<br>elsewhere for Garcia. The effect is a somewhat disjointed 
<br>vision and implementation of Brazil's foreign policy that can 
<br>lead to frustration on the part of Brazilian diplomats. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Where the interests of these three advisors coincide 
<br>in their views, Brazil's direction has been unequivocal: 
<br>prioritizing regional political integration, deepening 
<br>relations with emerging economies (e.g., through the BRICs 
<br>and IBSA--India, Brazil, South Africa--fora), expanding 
<br>south-south relations (e.g., through Arab States-South 
<br>America, South America-Africa, and Latin America-wide fora), 
<br>and increasing dialogue with other regional powers (Iran, 
<br>Venezuela, China, North Korea) to highlight its position as a 
<br>friend of both the United States and its adversaries. None 
<br>of the three admits that there is any interest or effort to 
<br>place relations with Europe and the United States on a second 
<br>plane, and staffing at Brazil's foreign missions seems to 
<br>bear this out (see septel). However, there is a growing 
<br>debate among the non-government foreign policy elite in 
<br>Brazil (refs A and B), and substantial opposition from the 
<br>private sector, regarding the wisdom of what is widely 
<br>acknowledged as a heavy south-south focus. This debate 
<br>expresses publicly the discomfort that many diplomats express 
<br>privately with the direction of Brazil's foreign policy under 
<br>Lula. Diplomats tell us that the leftist slant to policy has 
<br>resulted in "exile" either overseas or to domestic postings 
<br>outside Itamaraty (at universities, for example), self-exile 
<br>overseas, or early retirement for more senior colleagues.

<br>FM Amorim: the Nationalist Leftist 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) For all the sniping at Lula's foreign policy from 
<br>senior ex-diplomats--and such criticism is constant, public, 
<br>and widespread--Foreign Minister Amorim is one of their own, 
<br>a respected career diplomat steeped in traditional Itamaraty 
<br>nationalism. Historically, this expressed itself in 
<br>opposition to the United States, and it is still 
<br>unquestionably true that, within South America, Itamaraty 
<br>resists almost without exception regional initiatives 
<br>involving the United States. When the United States is at 
<br>the table, in Itamaraty's view, Brazil cannot lead. This may 
<br>explain why Itamaraty remains lukewarm regarding the Summit 
<br>of the Americas, has rejected cooperation with us in South 
<br>America on biofuels, and has launched a number of initiatives 
<br>in South America that do not include the United States. Most 
<br>recently, the December 2008 Bahia summits (refs C, D, E), 
<br>including the first-ever meeting of Latin American and 
<br>Caribbean heads of state and government, represented an 
<br>effort by Brazil to expand the scope of its leadership in the 
<br>
<br>BRASILIA 00000177 003 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>region, without having to play second fiddle to the United 
<br>States. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Under Amorim's most recent tenure as Foreign Minister, 
<br>however, Itamaraty nationalism has undergone a subtle shift. 
<br>(Note: Amorim also served as FM for 18 months under President 
<br>Itamar Franco, 1993-1994. He has served as FM under Lula 
<br>since 2003. End note.) Over the last several years, a 
<br>broader, once nearly knee-jerk anti-Americanism has given way 
<br>to a growing desire to have a seat among global players 
<br>addressing global issues, to be and be perceived as being an 
<br>equal to Europe, China, India, Japan, and the United States 
<br>on the world stage (ref F). The most notable expressions of 
<br>this tendency have been the renewed primacy given Itamaraty's 
<br>long-standing effort to secure a permanent seat on the UN 
<br>Security Council, a constructive and engaged role in the WTO 
<br>negotiations (under pressure from Brazil's private sector), 
<br>interest in playing in the Middle East peace process, and 
<br>most recently active engagement in discussions on the global 
<br>financial crisis. Compared with Guimaraes and Garcia, 
<br>Amorim's leftist views tend to be held in check by 
<br>traditional Itamaraty care for diplomatic niceties and an 
<br>almost reverential respect for reciprocity and 
<br>multilateralism. Brazil's recent decision to grant refugee 
<br>status to an Italian terrorist (ref G), for example, was 
<br>clearly made by the Justice Minister for ideological reasons, 
<br>and almost certainly without Amorim's support. 
<br>

<br>Secretary General Guimaraes: the Anti-American Leftist 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) One former diplomat told PolCouns that SG Guimaraes, a 
<br>career diplomat who was shunted aside by President Cardoso, 
<br>owes his influence and independence to being the Labor 
<br>Party's (PT) first choice for FM after Lula was elected. 
<br>Guimaraes believed he was not confirmable and suggested 
<br>Amorim, with himself as Secretary General--a move the PT 
<br>made, but which required congress to pass a waiver, as 
<br>Guimaraes had not served as ambassador, a legal requirement 
<br>to hold the post. Along with family connections (Guimaraes' 
<br>daughter is married to Amorim's son), this history may 
<br>explain his outsized authority and substantial autonomy. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Guimaraes is virulently anti-American, and anti-"first 
<br>world" in general. He has advocated extreme positions--for 
<br>example, that in order to be taken seriously on the world 
<br>stage Brazil must develop nuclear weapons--and as the senior 
<br>official in charge of personnel matters, he issued a required 
<br>reading list of anti-American books that has only recently 
<br>been toned down. He has been accused by current and former 
<br>diplomats of using ideological requirements in handing out 
<br>promotions. And he is known to have gone out of his way to 
<br>provoke and stall initiatives by U.S. and European countries. 
<br>Politico-military affairs, which are managed largely out of 
<br>his office, and counter-crime/counter-drug issues (managed by 
<br>him until earlier this year, and still subject to his 
<br>influence) remain two of our most difficult areas for 
<br>bilateral cooperation at the policy level, with initiatives 
<br>regularly stalled or stymied by Itamaraty. According to 
<br>European and Canadian diplomats, our problems with Guimaraes 
<br>are not unique, and they are awaiting as eagerly as we are 
<br>his mandatory retirement in November 2009, when he turns 70.

<br>Advisor Garcia: the Academic Leftist 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Many contacts, including most recently Defense 
<br>Minister Nelson Jobim (ref H), tell us that Marco Aurelio 
<br>Garcia is one of President's closest advisors, enjoying a 
<br>
<br>BRASILIA 00000177 004 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>longstanding personal relationship with him and exercising an 
<br>outsized influence. An academic leftist and long-time PT 
<br>member, Garcia has championed closer relations with leftist 
<br>governments in the region and beyond, as well as the 
<br>prioritization of south-south relations. Talking with 
<br>Americans, he tends to couch negative views of the United 
<br>States as good-natured jokes from the past ("When I was 
<br>young, we used to call the OAS 'the Ministry of U.S. 
<br>Colonies'"; "When I was a young man, the joke was, 'Why has 
<br>the United States never had a coup? Because it doesn't have 
<br>a U.S. embassy!'"). In the present, he has taken on 
<br>President Lula's pragmatic approach to foreign policy, 
<br>dealing with the United States and other non-leftist 
<br>countries in order to achieve Lula's objectives. Since the 
<br>new U.S. Administration has come on board, he has been 
<br>emphatic in passing along Lula's keen desire to meet soon 
<br>with President Obama. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Garcia's influence as Lula's most trusted foreign 
<br>policy advisor remains undiminished despite harsh criticism 
<br>from Brazil's foreign policy elite for being too "soft" on 
<br>its neighbors, which temporarily gave Itamaraty the upper 
<br>hand in managing the spate of problems between Brazil and 
<br>Bolivia, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Argentina in late 2008. 
<br>Garcia maintains the lead on contacts with South America's 
<br>leftist governments, and where he is not the author of 
<br>Brazil's outreach to countries such as Cuba, South Africa, 
<br>Iran, and Russia, he is fully supportive and active in 
<br>advancing these relationships.

<br>Comment: Prepare for the Challenge...and the Change 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) The ideological forces currently dominating Itamaraty 
<br>mean that, in the near term, the Foreign Ministry will 
<br>continue to represent a challenge for U.S. engagement on many 
<br>issues. At least through the end of the Lula administration, 
<br>the ideological bent of certain key policymakers will 
<br>constrain cooperation in some areas. Pursuing initiatives 
<br>with Brazil--and particularly those not dear to the principal 
<br>foreign policymakers--will continue to require a substantial 
<br>investment of time, strategic preparation, and effort to 
<br>overcome ideological headwinds, bureaucratic inertia, and 
<br>more pressing priorities (see also septels). 
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) In particular, although Itamaraty will remain a 
<br>significant player on almost all U.S. initiatives and 
<br>interests in Brazil, the way forward with the GOB will in 
<br>large measure involve working with other significant players 
<br>as well. In the first instance, this means the Presidency, 
<br>as Lula has made clear his interest in developing a closer 
<br>relationship with the United States and Garcia, his closest 
<br>advisor, is the most dependable in reflecting views. Second, 
<br>this means working with other GOB ministries and agencies 
<br>that will act as advocates for closer cooperation. Finally, 
<br>it means drawing in congress, the judiciary, governors, and 
<br>non-governmental players, and the private sector in 
<br>particular, which generally support working with the United 
<br>States and often have the ability to sway decisions in favor 
<br>of our initiatives. 
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) Building supportive coalitions with other Brazilian 
<br>players as a way to overcome MRE opposition is a tested 
<br>strategy: on the Tropical Forests Conservation Act debt swap, 
<br>enhanced visa terms, our NAS LOA, civil aviation, defense 
<br>cooperation, biofuels cooperation, information sharing, 
<br>climate change, and a host of other issues, developing 
<br>initiatives with and working through players other than 
<br>Itamaraty have been critical elements in our success. Most 
<br>recently, excellent relations with the Ministry of Justice, 
<br>
<br>BRASILIA 00000177 005 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>Federal Police, and the Presidency were crucial to overcoming 
<br>last-minute MRE refusal to issue visas to DEA agents 
<br>preparing to transfer from Bolivia to Brazil (see septel). 
<br>We expect that gaining Brazilian cooperation on climate 
<br>change and hemispheric energy security will also depend 
<br>heavily on working closely with players outside Itamaraty. 
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) Over the longer term, in light of the GOB's current 
<br>efforts to adjust to broader participation on the world 
<br>stage, we expect that senior Itamaraty policymakers will 
<br>continue to expand the range of issues on which they are 
<br>comfortable working in tandem with industrialized countries. 
<br>During the next decade, the older generation of diplomats, 
<br>who still often defined their interests as a regional power 
<br>in opposition to the United States, will be replaced by a 
<br>large cohort of younger, more pragmatic, and more globally 
<br>oriented officers. The recognition by at least some senior 
<br>Itamaraty officials that they have not done a good job of 
<br>training "Americanists" who understand the United States 
<br>suggests that there may well be increased openness to new 
<br>initiatives on this front, especially following the departure 
<br>of Samuel Guimaraes in 2009. Openness may increase further 
<br>in 2011 if the Lula government is replaced by one with a less 
<br>ideological set of senior policymakers. 
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) Post believes that it is critical to influence 
<br>Brazil's new generation of diplomats, which we generally find 
<br>more accessible and, while still strong nationalists, more 
<br>ready to consider cooperation where U.S.-Brazil interests 
<br>coincide. Among the new near-term possibilities we are 
<br>exploring is the possibility of establishing a more regular 
<br>program of speakers and digital video conferences with Rio 
<br>Branco to promote engagement between their diplomatic 
<br>trainees and U.S. diplomats and other interlocutors. 
<br>Depending on how this is received, we might consider 
<br>establishing a "young diplomats" group to allow for 
<br>additional contact and exposure with U.S. diplomats. Post 
<br>has also learned that the French instituted a diplomatic 
<br>exchange program with Itamaraty in 2008, similar to our 
<br>Transatlantic Diplomatic Fellowship, and now have a diplomat 
<br>working in Itamaraty's Europe Department. We believe a 
<br>similar proposal would be a valuable way both to test the 
<br>waters for cooperation and, if implemented, both to gain 
<br>further insight into the workings of this key ministry and to 
<br>give Brazilian diplomats greater understanding of how the USG 
<br>executes foreign policy.
