<br>SUBJECT: GENERAL PETRAEUS' MEETING WITH SALEH ON SECURITY
<br>ASSISTANCE, AQAP STRIKES
<br>
<br>REF: 2009 SANAA 1430
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Stephen A. Seche for reasons 1.4(b) and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) SUMMARY: Commander of the U.S. Central Command
<br>General David Petraeus congratulated President Saleh on
<br>recent successful operations against AQAP, and informed him
<br>that U.S. security assistance to the ROYG would increase to
<br>USD 150 million in 2010, including USD 45 million to equip
<br>and train a CT-focused aviation regiment under the Yemeni
<br>Special Operations Forces.  Saleh requested that the U.S.
<br>provide 12 armed helicopters and train and equip three new
<br>Republican Guard brigades.  Saleh rejected the General's
<br>proposal to have USG personnel armed with direct-feed
<br>intelligence present inside the area of CT operations, but
<br>agreed to a have U.S. fixed-wing bombers circle outside
<br>Yemeni territory ready to engage AQAP targets should
<br>actionable intelligence become available.  END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>SALEH: HELICOPTERS, HELICOPTERS, HELICOPTERS
<br>--------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) CENTCOM Commander General David Petraeus,
<br>accompanied by the Ambassador, CENTCOM aides, the Embassy
<br>DATT, and EconOff note taker, congratulated President Saleh
<br>on successful operations against AQAP during a January 2
<br>meeting.  The General told Saleh that he had requested USD
<br>150 million in security assistance for 2010, a substantial
<br>increase over the 2009 amount of USD 67 million.  Also
<br>present were Minister of Defense MG Muhammed Nasser Ahmad Ali
<br>and Deputy Prime Minister for Defense and Security Affairs
<br>Rashad al-Alimi.  Raising a topic that he would manage to
<br>insert into almost every item of discussion during the hour
<br>and half-long meeting, Saleh requested that the U.S. provide
<br>the ROYG with 12 armed helicopters.  Possessing such
<br>helicopters would allow the ROYG to take the lead in future
<br>CT operations, "ease" the use of fighter jets and cruise
<br>missiles against terrorist targets, and allow Yemeni Special
<br>Operations Forces to capture terrorist suspects and identify
<br>victims following strikes, according to Saleh.  The U.S.
<br>could convince Saudi Arabia and the UAE to supply six
<br>helicopters each if the American "bureaucracy" prevented
<br>quick approval, Saleh suggested.  The General responded that
<br>he had already considered the ROYG's request for helicopters
<br>and was in discussions with Saudi Arabia on the matter.  "We
<br>won't use the helicopters in Sa'ada, I promise.  Only against
<br>al-Qaeda," Saleh told General Petraeus.
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) Saleh agreed to General Patraeus' proposal to
<br>dedicate USD 45 million of 2010 security assistance funds to
<br>help establish and train a YSOF aviation regiment, allowing
<br>YSOF to focus on al-Qaeda targets and leaving Sa'ada air
<br>operations to the Yemeni Air Force.  Without giving much
<br>detail, Saleh also requested that the U.S. equip and train
<br>three new Republican Guard brigades, totaling 9,000 soldiers.
<br>"Equipping these brigades would reflect upon our true
<br>partnership," Saleh said.  The General urged Saleh to focus
<br>first on the YSOF aviation regiment.
<br>
<br>AQAP STRIKES: CONCERN FOR CIVILIAN CASUALTIES
<br>---------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) Saleh praised the December 17 and 24 strikes
<br>against AQAP but said that "mistakes were made" in the
<br>killing of civilians in Abyan.  The General responded that
<br>the only civilians killed were the wife and two children of
<br>an AQAP operative at the site, prompting Saleh to plunge into
<br>a lengthy and confusing aside with Deputy Prime Minister
<br>Alimi and Minister of Defense Ali regarding the number of
<br>terrorists versus civilians killed in the strike.  (Comment:
<br>Saleh's conversation on the civilian casualties suggests he
<br>has not been well briefed by his advisors on the strike in
<br>Abyan, a site that the ROYG has been unable to access to
<br>determine with any certainty the level of collateral damage.
<br>End Comment.)  AQAP leader Nassr al-Wahishi and extremist
<br>cleric Anwar al-Awlaki may still be alive, Saleh said, but
<br>the December strikes had already caused al-Qaeda operatives
<br>to turn themselves in to authorities and residents in
<br>affected areas to deny refuge to al-Qaeda.  Saleh raised the
<br>issue of the Saudi Government and Jawf governorate tribal
<br>sheikh Amin al-Okimi, a subject that is being reported
<br>through other channels.
<br>
<br>SHIFTING AIRSTRIKE STRATEGIES
<br>-----------------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) President Obama has approved providing U.S.
<br>intelligence in support of ROYG ground operations against
<br>AQAP targets, General Petraeus informed Saleh.  Saleh reacted
<br>coolly, however, to the General's proposal to place USG
<br>personnel inside the area of operations armed with real-time,
<br>direct feed intelligence from U.S. ISR platforms overhead.
<br>"You cannot enter the operations area and you must stay in
<br>the joint operations center," Saleh responded.  Any U.S.
<br>casualties in strikes against AQAP would harm future efforts,
<br>Saleh asserted.  Saleh did not have any objection, however,
<br>to General Petraeus' proposal to move away from the use of
<br>cruise missiles and instead have U.S. fixed-wing bombers
<br>circle outside Yemeni territory, "out of sight," and engage
<br>AQAP targets when actionable intelligence became available.
<br>Saleh lamented the use of cruise missiles that are "not very
<br>accurate" and welcomed the use of aircraft-deployed
<br>precision-guided bombs instead.  "We'll continue saying the
<br>bombs are ours, not yours," Saleh said, prompting Deputy
<br>Prime Minister Alimi to joke that he had just "lied" by
<br>telling Parliament that the bombs in Arhab, Abyan, and Shebwa
<br>were American-made but deployed by the ROYG.
<br>
<br>ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN MIL-MIL RELATIONS
<br>-----------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) General Petraeus praised cooperation between the
<br>Embassy and the NSB, YSOF, Yemeni Coast Guard (YCG), and
<br>Counterterrorism Unit (CTU), but singled out relations with
<br>the Yemeni Air Force as problematic.  Only four out of 50
<br>planned U.S. Special Operations Forces Command training
<br>missions with the Yemeni Air Force had actually been executed
<br>in the past year, he said.  Saleh said he would personally
<br>instruct Minister of Defense to improve the situation.  The
<br>General also urged Saleh to stop Yemeni Customs' habit of
<br>holding up Embassy cargo at the airport, including shipments
<br>destined for the ROYG itself, such as equipment for the CTU.
<br>Saleh laughed and made a vague pledge to have the customs
<br>issue "taken care of."  Saleh complained that the ROYG had
<br>not yet received the necessary training to operate 17 Iraqi
<br>Light Armored Vehicle (ILAVs) provided by the USG in 2008,
<br>saying that YSOF needed the training in order to use the
<br>ILAVs for CT operations.  The General said he would look into
<br>having U.S. Special Operations Forces personnel conduct the
<br>training.
<br>
<br>¶7. (S/NF) Pointing to the ROYG's problems in combating
<br>rampant drug and arms smuggling, Saleh told General Petraeus
<br>that U.S. maritime security assistance was insufficient to
<br>cover Yemen's nearly 2,000 km of coastline.  "Why not have
<br>Italy, Germany, Holland, Japan, Saudi, and the UAE each
<br>provide two patrol boats?" Saleh suggested.  The General told
<br>Saleh that two fully-equipped 87-foot patrol boats destined
<br>for the Yemeni Coast Guard were under construction and would
<br>arrive in Yemen within a year.  Saleh singled out smuggling
<br>from Djibouti as particularly troublesome, claiming that the
<br>ROYG had recently intercepted four containers of
<br>Djibouti-origin TNT.  "Tell (Djiboutian President) Ismail
<br>Guelleh that I don't care if he smuggles whiskey into Yemen
<br>-- provided it's good whiskey ) but not drugs or weapons,"
<br>Saleh joked.  Saleh said that smugglers of all stripes are
<br>bribing both Saudi and Yemeni border officials.
<br>
<br>SALEH WELCOMES LONDON CONFERENCE
<br>--------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (S/NF) Saleh told the General that he welcomed PM Gordon
<br>Brown's announcement of the London conference and said that
<br>the cooperation on Yemen between the U.S., EU, Saudi Arabia,
<br>and the UAE would be benefitial.  Qatar should not be
<br>involved, however, because "they work with Iran."  In this
<br>regard, Saleh also identified Qatar as one of those nations
<br>working "against Yemen," along with Iran, Libya, and Eritrea.
<br>
<br>¶9. (U) General Petraeus did not have an opportunity to clear
<br>on this cable.
