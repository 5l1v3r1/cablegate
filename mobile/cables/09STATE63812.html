<br>
<br>FROM NEA ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY JEFFREY
<br>FELTMAN FOR CHARGE MILES 
<br>
<br>I commend Embassy Ashgabat and in particular
<br>Iran Watcher xxxxx, for its
<br>excellent reporting on the Iranian elections.
<br>Embassy insights were extremely useful for
<br>their timeliness and for the helpful view
<br>from "man on the street" Iranians.
<br>Your second cable in particular
<br>identified the interesting trend that
<br>Mousavi was picking up votes from rural
<br>voters. This excellent reporting provided
<br>key insights to 7th floor principals and NEA.
<br>
<br>Embassy reporting gave Washington recipients
<br>an important view of working class Iranians' views on
<br>the elections. Washington appreciates this reporting
<br>that represents a key socioeconomic class from a variety
<br>of geographic areas and ethnic groups -- a group
<br>to which we might not otherwise have access.
<br>By continuing and expanding your outreach,
<br>you have provided an important
<br>snapshot of the elections. This crucial information has
<br>helped NEA and key principals in deciphering the
<br>maze of Iranian electoral politics.
<br>
<br>We look forward to further high quality reporting
<br>from Embassy Ashgabat as we look to interpret
<br>the election results and information you garner
<br>from this key socioeconomic class and other contacts.
<br>
<br>You have set a high standard for your colleagues
<br>here in Washington and elsewhere.
<br>
<br>Best,
<br>
<br>Jeff
