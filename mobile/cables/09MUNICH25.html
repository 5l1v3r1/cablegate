<br>------- 
<br>SUMMARY 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (SBU) Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (37) is Germany's new and 
<br>youngest-ever Economics Minister, assuming a portfolio for which he 
<br>is not wholly suited academically (REF A) but which he could master 
<br>using his proven personal and political skills. If he is successful, 
<br>he could become the poster child for renewal of Horst Seehofer's 
<br>Christian Social Union (CSU), now struggling to convince voters that 
<br>it is modern and savvy enough to succeed and not the hide-bound 
<br>regional redoubt of conservatism that lost big in Bavaria last fall 
<br>(REF B).  (Biographical data at paragraph 8.)    End Summary. 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (SBU) Supporters and detractors focus on the same qualities in 
<br>the precocious zu Guttenberg: his youth, charisma, foreign policy 
<br>experience, and upward momentum.  Supporters say he will be 
<br>effective because he understands modern challenges, is well known on 
<br>both sides of the Atlantic, and is effective.  Detractors say he has 
<br>too little experience in general and that his foreign policy 
<br>expertise is wrong for the Economics Ministry during an economic 
<br>crisis. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (SBU) Zu Guttenberg has a proven record of beating the 
<br>expectations of politicians and the public.  He unexpectedly 
<br>contested and won the Chairmanship of the CSU in Upper Franconia, a 
<br>region of Bavaria, in 2007. After becoming party general secretary 
<br>just three months ago, he used warmth, charisma and direct 
<br>engagement to win over party members in the provinces who were 
<br>skeptical of his allegedly cool and aristocratic bearing (see bio 
<br>notes below at paragraph 8). 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br>Politicians Curious; Private Sector Upbeat 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶4.   (SBU) Zu Guttenberg could add some gloss to the cabinet by 
<br>concentrating in a high-profile way on the business side of the 
<br>economy, leaving high finance to Peer Steinbrueck (Social Democratic 
<br>Party, SPD).  This might be a good strategy.  Senior contacts at the 
<br>Bavarian Economics Ministry told the Consulate political specialist 
<br>that "they are enthusiastic about zu Guttenberg."  Although he would 
<br>not really have time to master the difficult ministry within the six 
<br>months he has before the Federal Bundestag election, they believed 
<br>zu Guttenberg was "smart, with a quick mind, and that he would 
<br>definitely make himself far more visible than Glos ever did." 
<br>Embassy contacts in Berlin have echoed these sentiments and think zu 
<br>Guttenberg is well-suited to capitalize on opportunities with the 
<br>new US Administration.  He seems to get on well with Chancellor 
<br>Merkel.  Moreover, business representatives and the private sector 
<br>have given the new man an early round of applause.  For example, 
<br>Employers' Association President Dieter Hundt said zu Guttenberg's 
<br>international experience, political clout, and contacts would all 
<br>help him promote the interests of employers.  Representatives from 
<br>Industry and Chambers of Commerce expressed the expectation that zu 
<br>Guttenberg would support medium-sized business and strengthen 
<br>transatlantic economic ties, based on his own experience in his 
<br>family's enterprises.  Zu Guttenberg's tasks are manifold: 
<br>Implementation of the savings package worth 100 billion Euros; 
<br>negotiate with companies that have asked for state money, such as 
<br>Continental and car manufacturer Opel; find a solution for Hypo Real 
<br>Estate bank; and tackle a wealth of questions with regard to energy 
<br>and ecology. Chancellor Merkel will want zu Guttenberg to strike a 
<br>balance between being seen as a hands-on minister and preventing the 
<br>election campaign from being fought over the financial crisis, 
<br>something that could weaken Government prospects. 
<br> 
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br>THE NEW CSU - MORE ATTRACTIVE TO VOTERS? 
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (SBU) With this appointment, Bavarian Minister President Horst 
<br>Seehofer, also CSU, extended his radical rejuvenation strategy of 
<br>the party to the federal level.  Michael Glos was the last senior 
<br>CSU politician from the preceding Edmund Stoiber generation.  "zu 
<br>Guttenberg is young, very young - but that is exactly what I want in 
<br>the process of renewal," said Seehofer.  The CSU faces potentially 
<br>existential challenges in the races for the German Federal and 
<br>European Parliaments and Seehofer obviously believes that only fresh 
<br>faces can lead the party into a brighter future.  After taking 
<br>office as Bavarian Minister President last fall, Seehofer replaced 
<br>all members of the cabinet over 60 years of age with considerably 
<br> 
<br>MUNICH 00000025  002 OF 002 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>younger people, including more women.  Seehofer's departure as 
<br>Federal Agriculture Minister enabled him to install 44-year old Ilse 
<br>Aigner as his successor. With zu Guttenberg gone to Berlin, Seehofer 
<br>has appointed two from the younger CSU generation to replace him - 
<br>Alexander Dobrindt, a relative unknown 38-year-old Bundestag deputy, 
<br>and Dorothee Baer, the 30-year-old who was just recently promoted to 
<br>foreign policy spokesperson of the CSU Bundestag caucus.  Seehofer 
<br>knows that the June 7 European Parliament elections and the 
<br>September 27 national elections are the tests to see whether 
<br>Bavarians go along with his new CSU. 
<br> 
<br>------- 
<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (SBU) The SPD may hope to profit from the replacement of Michael 
<br>Glos with the relatively inexperienced zu Guttenberg; this may prove 
<br>difficult.  Glos was from the start considered one of Merkel's 
<br>weakest ministers, and his departure removes a favorite target of 
<br>his political opponents.  It will be far more difficult to score 
<br>points by attacking his successor, who is a skilled debater.  In the 
<br>middle of a serious economic and financial crisis, zu Guttenberg's 
<br>challenge will be to convince the electorate in Germany that the 
<br>CDU/CSU remains the party best able to cope with economic 
<br>challenges.  It may not hurt that the new CSU Secretary General, 
<br>Alexander Dobrindt, has previously served as economic spokesman of 
<br>the CSU caucus.  The economy will no doubt be the overriding issue 
<br>in the unfolding election campaign.

<br>Biographical Data: Germany's Youngest Minister, a Baron 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  The 37-year-old Karl-Theodor von und zu Guttenberg was CSU 
<br>Secretary General for only 100 days.  His nomination to Federal 
<br>Economics Minister had not been on his agenda; however, he said, it 
<br>was "an honor he could not reject." zu Guttenberg, descendent of a 
<br>nobility line dating back to the year 1149, comes from a family with 
<br>a strong political background: His grandfather was a Parliamentarian 
<br>State Secretary under Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, his father is a 
<br>famous conductor, and his grand-uncle supported NS resistance 
<br>fighter Count von Stauffenberg and was executed by the Nazis.  His 
<br>father left the CSU when then-Minister President Streibl cancelled 
<br>his participation in a demonstration against anti-Semitism (he later 
<br>rejoined the party).  Zu Guttenberg is a man of considerable 
<br>rhetorical skills, which in 2007 resulted in his election to CSU 
<br>district chairman of Upper Franconia over his rival, party whip 
<br>Hartmut Koschyk.  Ever since he became a member of the Bundestag in 
<br>2002, he has proven a quick study, making himself a name as foreign 
<br>and security policy expert.  He draws from a rich network of 
<br>international contacts, in Europe as well as in the U.S.  Right 
<br>before the February 6-8 Munich Security Conference, he chaired a 
<br>roundtable on foreign policy issues, attended, among others, by 
<br>Special Representative Richard Holbrooke, Deputy Secretary James 
<br>Steinberg, and USNATO Ambassador Kurt Volker.  He is not without an 
<br>economic background.  For a few years, he worked as investment 
<br>banker in New York; until 2002, he served as managing director of a 
<br>family business.  He also helped prepare a medium-sized company, 
<br>Rhoen Hospitals, to enter the stock market.  He speaks fluent 
<br>English.  His wife, Stephanie, is also of noble lineage.  They have 
<br>two daughters.  Diplopedia reference:
