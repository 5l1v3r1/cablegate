<br>Classified By: Ambassador Robert F. Godec for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
<br>
<br>------- 
<br>Summary 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) President Ben Ali and NEA Assistant Secretary 
<br>David Welch discussed regional and bilateral issues in a 
<br>wide-ranging, warm and open meeting on Thursday, February 28. 
<br>In response to A/S Welch's remarks and requests, President 
<br>Ben Ali: 
<br>
<br>-- promised counter-terrorism cooperation "without 
<br>reservation," including US access to a terrorist in Tunisian 
<br>custody; 
<br>-- said the GOT would accept the ten remaining Tunisian 
<br>detainees in Guantanamo on the basis of the constitution; 
<br>-- welcomed the Annapolis peace process, adding that 
<br>Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas is "optimistic" 
<br>a deal will be concluded and plans to visit Tunis in March; 
<br>and, 
<br>-- said there is "no reason" for an Arab League Summit in 
<br>Damascus unless there is a Lebanese president and opined that 
<br>the meeting might be postponed or representation 
<br>downgraded. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) Welch and Ben Ali also covered US-Libyan 
<br>relations, relations between Morocco and Algeria, the 
<br>situation in Iraq and the challenge of Iran. The 
<br>constructive session underscored again that Tunisia is 
<br>prepared to play a moderate, but not a leadership, role on 
<br>regional problems. Overall, Ben Ali was clearly pleased with 
<br>Welch's visit and it received wide media coverage. End 
<br>Summary. 
<br>
<br>-------------------- 
<br>Meeting: The Setting 
<br>-------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) During his February 27 - 29 visit, NEA A/S David 
<br>Welch met with President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali for one hour 
<br>45 minutes at the Presidential Palace in Carthage on 
<br>Thursday, February 28. Foreign Minister Abdelwaheb Abdallah 
<br>and Ambassador Godec were also present. The Director of 
<br>Tunisia's External Communications Agency (ATCE), Oussama 
<br>Romdhani, was the interpreter. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
<br>Bilateral Relations: CT Cooperation "Without Reservation" 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) Ben Ali began by emphasizing the excellent, 
<br>"strategic" relations between the United States and Tunisia. 
<br>He continued, however, that he understood the United States 
<br>had concerns about cooperation on counter-terrorism. Ben Ali 
<br>said he had ordered Minister of 
<br>Interior Rafik Belhaj Kacem and other senior officials to 
<br>cooperate with the United States "without reservation" on 
<br>counter-terrorism. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) The President stressed that Tunisia cooperated 
<br>with the United States on terrorism out of conviction, and 
<br>said broader, deeper international cooperation is essential. 
<br>Many countries, he said, have suffered as the result of 
<br>terrorism. He expressed regret, however, over the human 
<br>rights criticism Tunisia has faced as the result 
<br>of its efforts to combat terrorism. Some governments have a 
<br>"double standard," he said, on the issue. He added "some 
<br>embassies" in Tunis and human rights groups had taken 
<br>positions that were "not friendly" over such cases such as 
<br>the imprisonment of activist Mohammed Abbou and of the 
<br>"Zarzis group." (NB. The "Zarzis group" refers to six 
<br>Tunisians detained in 2003 for allegedly preparing to commit 
<br>terrorist attacks. The six were pardoned by Ben Ali in 2006 
<br>following international pressure.) Ben Ali acknowledged that 
<br>there had been some problems with human rights in Tunisia, 
<br>but stressed the GOT is addressing them. For example, he 
<br>said, "tens" of police officers have been tried for 
<br>corruption and other abuses. He said he would welcome the US 
<br>Embassy receiving further information. He stressed that the 
<br>GOT is committed to freedom and human rights, but no one is 
<br>above the law. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) A/S Welch thanked Ben Ali and expressed 
<br>appreciation for his commitment to cooperation on 
<br>counter-terrorism. He said he had two specific requests: 1) 
<br>access for US officials to interview Tunisian terrorist 
<br>
<br>Noureddine Taam and 2) a commitment to accept the Tunisian 
<br>detainees in Guantanamo on the basis of earlier assurances on 
<br>treatment. Ben Ali responded that the United States would 
<br>have immediate access to Taam. (NB. Additional details 
<br>reported in GRPO channels.) He continued that the GOT would 
<br>accept the detainees and do so on the basis of the Tunisian 
<br>constitution. (NB. The Tunisian constitution offers 
<br>guarantees on human rights, humane treatment and respect for 
<br>international commitments.) Ben Ali emphasized again that on 
<br>counter-terrorism and intelligence Tunisia would "cooperate 
<br>with the United States without inhibitions" and the 
<br>cooperation would be "total." 
<br>
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br>Libya: Trying to Improve US Relations 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S/NF) A/S Welch said the United States is improving 
<br>relations with Libya, but from time to time has difficulties 
<br>with leader Muammar Qadhafi. Welch asked that Ben Ali 
<br>communicate to Qadhafi that the United States wants to 
<br>continue to improve relations. Ben Ali replied that Qadhafi 
<br>also wants better relations, but there remain "anti-American 
<br>radicals" in the government. Qadhafi plans, according to Ben 
<br>Ali, a cabinet reshuffle that would address the problem and 
<br>we should see how the situation evolves. Qadhafi, Ben Ali 
<br>opined, is "not a normal person" and had experienced 
<br>disappointments over the failure of Arab and African unity. 
<br>Ben Ali promised to raise the US interest in improving 
<br>relations with Qadhafi in person or by phone. 
<br>
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br>Middle East: The Peace Process Needs Support 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (S) Welch stressed that President Bush's highest priority 
<br>this year is progress toward two states, Palestine and 
<br>Israel, living side-by-side in peace. While Palestinian 
<br>Authority President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert genuinely 
<br>want peace, some of the Palestinian and Israeli people and 
<br>leaders are skeptical. Welch stressed that all countries 
<br>interested in peace need to make every effort to help move 
<br>the process forward. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (S) Ben Ali agreed on the importance of the Annapolis 
<br>process, adding he had spoken with Abbas who is "optimistic" 
<br>an agreement will be reached by the end of the year. 
<br>Nevertheless, progress will remain very difficult. Ben Ali 
<br>stressed Fatah and Hamas must try to reach an understanding. 
<br>He noted that Abbas will visit Tunisia in March and there is 
<br>a proposal for a Fatah-Hamas meeting in Tunis. Ben Ali said 
<br>he will wait to hear Abbas' views before proceeding on the 
<br>proposal. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------- 
<br>Arab League Summit: Not Without A Lebanese President 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------- 
<br>
<br>¶10. (S) Welch asked Ben Ali about his views of Syria and the 
<br>proposed Arab League Summit. Ben Ali responded that Syria is 
<br>a source of concern. He said Syria is acting for Iran and 
<br>the latter is fueling regional problems. He said he had met 
<br>(on February 18) with Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mu'allim 
<br>who handed over an invitation from President Bashar Asad to 
<br>attend the summit in Damascus. He said he told Mu'allim that 
<br>Syria should help resolve the problems in Lebanon. Ben Ali 
<br>emphasized the complexity of the situation in Lebanon, noting 
<br>the unhelpful involvement of many regional actors. He added 
<br>that there was some support for inviting Iran to the Damascus 
<br>Summit. Ben Ali said, however, that he saw no reason for the 
<br>summit unless there is a Lebanese president in attendance. 
<br>Welch agreed. Ben Ali continued the summit may be postponed, 
<br>or representation downgraded from the Chief of State level. 
<br>He noted other states in the region, including Morocco, 
<br>Jordan, and Saudi Arabia agreed. In any event, Ben Ali said 
<br>he would not attend such a summit. 
<br>
<br>--------------------- 
<br>Iraq: Bleak Situation 
<br>--------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶11. (S/NF) Ben Ali said the situation in Iraq is "bleak," but 
<br>we must face it. The only party benefiting currently is 
<br>Iran, and suggested that Turkey's current actions against the 
<br>PKK are making matters worse. Welch noted there is some 
<br>progress on the security situation and the political front in 
<br>Iraq. 
<br>
<br>
<br>------------------- 
<br>Region: "Explosive" 
<br>------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶12. (S) Looking more broadly, Ben Ali noted that Tunisia was 
<br>happy it was part of the Maghreb, and not part of Levant or 
<br>Gulf. He opined that the situation in Egypt is 
<br>"explosive," adding that sooner or later the Muslim 
<br>Brotherhood would take over. He added that Yemen and Saudi 
<br>Arabia are also facing real problems. Overall, the region is 
<br>"explosive." 
<br>
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br>Maghreb: Resolving the Western Sahara 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶13. (S) On the Maghreb, Ben Ali suggested extremism is a real 
<br>and growing problem. Morocco, he said, was at the "beginning 
<br>of the beginning" of its problem. It had 
<br>ignored, he added, the issue for too long and former King 
<br>Hassan II had refused to discuss it. Nevertheless, Morocco 
<br>was a strategic partner for Tunisia and the GOT was working 
<br>to strengthen cooperation. On Algeria, Ben Ali, said the 
<br>problem was a "little better" and may be at the beginning of 
<br>the end. Ben Ali said Tunisia has strong and direct 
<br>cooperation on counter-terrorism with Algeria. Welch noted 
<br>that Morocco and Algeria trust Tunisia more than they trust 
<br>each other. Welch agreed that there is a terrorism problem 
<br>in Morocco. 
<br>
<br>¶14. (S) On the Western Sahara, Ben Ali said the Algerians 
<br>are responsible for the ongoing impasse. Welch agreed, 
<br>saying the issue was blocking progress in the region. He 
<br>said the Algerians need to accept that there is not going to 
<br>be an independent state in the Western Sahara. Ben Ali said 
<br>the problem is complex, and will take years to resolve. He 
<br>added it cannot be settled through the UN Security Council. 
<br>He noted Tunisia had tried to convene a Maghreb meeting on it 
<br>in Tunis. While Morocco and Libya had agreed to attend, 
<br>Algeria refused, saying there was nothing to discuss. 
<br>
<br>-------------- 
<br>Iran: A Threat 
<br>-------------- 
<br>
<br>¶15. (S) Welch noted that President Bush considered Iran a 
<br>threat "yesterday, today and tomorrow." Noting the recent 
<br>National Intelligence Estimate on Iran, Welch underscored 
<br>that while the Iranians "may have put the gun in the closet, 
<br>they are still trying to make the bullet." Nevertheless, he 
<br>added, there are signs economic pressure is working. Ben Ali 
<br>concurred. Welch said the chances of a third Security 
<br>Council resolution are good and President Bush wants a 
<br>diplomatic option. 
<br>
<br>¶16. (S/NF) Ben Ali replied this is "quite wise" of President 
<br>Bush. He stressed he opposed the use of force, and that "a 
<br>second front is not needed." Economic pressure on Iran will 
<br>take longer, but it is working. Ben Ali added that he "does 
<br>not trust" the Shia. 
<br>
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br>Invitation: President Bush Welcome 
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶17. (S) President Ben Ali closed the meeting stressing his 
<br>open invitation to President Bush to visit Tunisia before or 
<br>after his time in office. Welch expressed his appreciation 
<br>to Ben Ali for the meeting. 
<br>
<br>------------------------------ 
<br>Comment: Warm and Open Ben Ali 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶18. (S/NF) Throughout the meeting, President Ben Ali was 
<br>warm, open, and occasionally animated (at which point he 
<br>sometimes slipped into Tunisian dialect). His quick and 
<br>strong assurances on counter-terrorism cooperation were 
<br>welcome, and may be an important step forward on what has 
<br>been a troubling issue. Significantly, the President's 
<br>promise was followed within hours by action from GOT 
<br>officials. The key test will be whether cooperation 
<br>continues and is both broad and deep. Similarly, the 
<br>President's commitment on Guantanamo detainees was welcome. 
<br>
<br>¶19. (S/NF) On regional issues, Ben Ali showed again that he 
<br>
<br>is a moderate. While the Tunisians will not take the lead on 
<br>foreign policy challenges, they will help where they can 
<br>(e.g., support for the Annapolis process). Finally, 
<br>President Ben Ali was clearly very pleased to see A/S Welch 
<br>and to exchange views with him. The meeting and visit got 
<br>broad, major media coverage in Tunisia. End Comment. 
<br>
<br>¶20. (SBU) A/S Welch did not have a chance to clear this 
<br>cable.
