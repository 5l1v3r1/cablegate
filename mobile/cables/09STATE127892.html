<br>
<br>¶1. (U) This is an action cable.  Please see paragraphs 2-3.
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) Summary and Action Request. The United States is
<br>developing a strategy for reaffirming both NATO and U.S.
<br>commitment to the core responsibility of the Alliance:
<br>collective defense.  Examining NATO's approach to contingency
<br>planning will be one element of that strategy.  Moving from
<br>country-specific to regional contingency plans is one potential
<br>method. Expanding EAGLE GUARDIAN could be a first step in favor of
<br>regional planning.  USNATO should engage NATO Secretary General
<br>Rasmussen to begin to build support for expanding Eagle Guardian.
<br>In early 2010, the U.S. Military Representative (MILREP) at NATO
<br>HQ should take the following actions:  1) meet jointly with the
<br>Chairman of the Military Committee (CMC), the German MILREP, and
<br>other MILREPs as appropriate to urge the CMC to task the Supreme
<br>Allied Commander, Europe (SACEUR) to include the Baltic States in
<br>the revision of EAGLE GUARDIAN, and 2) approach the CMC and
<br>request that he task SACEUR to brief the Military Committee on
<br>each of NATO's contingency plans with guidance that he identify
<br>any gaps in those plans.  We will be better positioned to consider
<br>a broader regional approach after receiving SACEUR's assessment
<br>
<br>USNATO and Action Embassies are asked to engage with appropriate
<br>Baltic and Polish officials before December 16 to outline the U.S.
<br>position, while stressing the need to keep details related to
<br>NATO's military plans confidential.  Contingency points are also
<br>provided at paragraph 4 for responding to public inquiries. End
<br>Summary and Action Request.
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) Washington shares USNATO's goal of a non-politicized
<br>process for moving forward.  Washington believes that increased
<br>public attention on the issue could complicate our efforts to
<br>achieve that goal.  We need to make that point clearly to our
<br>Baltic Allies and Poland, while also underscoring that we take
<br>their request for NATO contingency planning seriously and support
<br>steps to address their concerns.  We understand Baltic and Polish
<br>leaders will meet on December 16 and will discuss, among other
<br>topics, NATO contingency planning.  It will be important to engage
<br>with Baltic and Polish officials in advance of that meeting to
<br>both outline our support for expanding EAGLE GUARDIAN, and our
<br>vision for a process that can deliver a successful result.  In
<br>discussions with Baltic and Polish officials, Action Posts should
<br>draw upon the points below.
<br>
<br>(S/REL NATO) Begin Talking Points:
<br>
<br>FOR RIGA, TALLINN, AND VILNIUS
<br>
<br>-- The United States has taken careful note of the
<br>repeated requests by all three Baltic states for NATO
<br>contingency planning for the defense of the Baltic
<br>region.
<br>
<br>-- The United States believes that NATO - as a matter of
<br>course - should conduct appropriate contingency planning
<br>for the possible defense of Allied territory and
<br>populations.  NATO's Article 5 commitment requires no
<br>less.
<br>
<br>-- As President Obama said in Prague: "We must work
<br>together as NATO members so that we have contingency plans
<br>in place to deal with new threats, wherever they may come
<br>from."
<br>
<br>-- After spending the last several months examining
<br>options on how to carry out NATO contingency planning for
<br>the Baltic states, the United States has decided that the
<br>best course of action would be to take advantage of the
<br>ongoing revision of the existing defense of Poland plan,
<br>EAGLE GUARDIAN.  EAGLE GUARDIAN could be expanded to
<br>include the defense of the Baltic states.  This expansion
<br>is a logical military extension of the existing
<br>contingency plan and fits well within the scenario posited
<br>by EAGLE GUARDIAN.
<br>
<br>-- We would also like to make clear that we see the
<br>expansion of EAGLE GUARDIAN as a step toward the possible
<br>expansion of NATO's other existing country-specific contingency
<br>plans into regional plans.  This is the first step in a multi-
<br>stage process to develop a complete set of appropriate contingency
<br>plans for the full range of possible threats -- both regional and
<br>functional -- as soon as possible.  At the same time, we believe
<br>contingency planning is only one element of NATO's Article 5
<br>preparedness.
<br>
<br>-- The United States is prepared to work closely with NATO
<br>Military Authorities and with other Allies to forge a
<br>consensus in favor of expanding EAGLE GUARDIAN to include the
<br>defense of the Baltic states, starting immediately in the new year
<br>when NATO reopens following its winter break.
<br>
<br>(S/REL NATO) FOR WARSAW
<br>
<br>-- The United States has taken careful note of the
<br>repeated requests by all three Baltic states for NATO
<br>contingency planning for the defense of the Baltic
<br>region.
<br>
<br>-- The United States believes that NATO - as a matter of
<br>course - should conduct appropriate contingency planning
<br>for the possible defense of Allied territory and
<br>populations.  NATO's Article 5 commitment requires no
<br>less.
<br>
<br>-- As President Obama said in Prague: "We must work
<br>together as NATO members so that we have contingency plans
<br>in place to deal with new threats, wherever they may come
<br>from."
<br>
<br>-- After spending the last several months examining
<br>options for how to carry out NATO contingency planning for
<br>the Baltic states, the United States has decided that the
<br>best course of action would be to take advantage of the
<br>ongoing revision of the existing defense of Poland plan,
<br>EAGLE GUARDIAN.  EAGLE GUARDIAN could be expanded to
<br>include the defense of the Baltic states.
<br>
<br>-- This expansion is a logical military extension of the
<br>existing contingency plan and fits well within the
<br>scenario posited by EAGLE GUARDIAN.  In fact, defending
<br>Poland necessarily entails defending the Baltic states, as
<br>well.
<br>
<br>-- We would also like to make clear that we see the
<br>expansion of EAGLE GUARDIAN as a step toward the possible
<br>expansion of NATO's other existing country-specific contingency
<br>plans into regional plans.  This is the first step in a multi-
<br>stage process to develop a complete set of appropriate contingency
<br>plans for the full range of possible threats - both regional and
<br>functional - as soon as possible.  At the same time, we believe
<br>contingency planning is only one element of NATO's Article 5
<br>preparedness.
<br>
<br>-- The United States is prepared to work closely with NATO
<br>Military Authorities and with other Allies to forge a
<br>consensus in favor of expanding EAGLE GUARDIAN to include the
<br>defense of the Baltic states, starting immediately in the new year
<br>when NATO reopens following its winter break.
<br>
<br>-- We do not believe that this will result in any
<br>significant delays for concluding the EAGLE GUARDIAN
<br>revision.  Nor do we believe that this in any way
<br>endangers planning for the defense of Poland.  In fact, we
<br>believe that the planning for the defense of Poland will
<br>be much more robust with the inclusion of the Baltics.
<br>
<br>(S/REL NATO) POINTS ABOUT PUBLIC DISCUSSION OF PLANS (FOR USE AT
<br>POST'S DISCRETION)
<br>
<br>-- The United States believes strongly
<br>that such planning should not be discussed
<br>publicly.
<br>These military plans are classified
<br>at
<br>the NATO SECRET level
<br>.
<br>
<br>-- The Alliance has many public diplomacy tools at its
<br>disposal.  Contingency planning is not one of them.  What
<br>we should do is explore other public steps for
<br>demonstrating the vitality of Article 5, such as
<br>exercises, defense investment, and partnerships.
<br>
<br>-- Public discussion of contingency plans undermines their
<br>military value, giving insight into NATO's planning
<br>processes.  This weakens the security of all Allies.
<br>
<br>--
<br>Public discussion of the plan would also make it
<br>politically much more difficult for some Allies to support
<br>the EAGLE GUARDIAN revision, creating divisions within the
<br>Alliance and throwing the whole project into doubt.
<br>
<br>-- A public discussion of contingency planning would also
<br>likely lead to an unnecessary increase in NATO-Russia
<br>tensions, something we should try to avoid as we work to
<br>improve practical cooperation in areas of common
<br>NATO-Russia interest.
<br>
<br>-- We believe that the proposed revision of EAGLE GUARDIAN
<br>is achievable and will represent a significant response to
<br>the Baltic request for contingency planning.
<br>
<br>-- We hope that we can count on your support in these
<br>efforts, including on keeping discussions on NATO
<br>contingency planning out of the public domain.
<br>
<br>-- We should work together on using exercises, defense
<br>investment, and partnerships to demonstrate to our publics
<br>that Article 5's value ultimately lies in NATO's
<br>capabilities and deterrence, rather than specific
<br>planning.
<br>
<br>(C) FOR ALL ACTION POSTS -- IF ASKED
<br>
<br>Q: Why wait until the new year?  Why not start now?
<br>A: NATO Headquarters is heading into its winter break,
<br>when only a skeletal staff is in place.  Our ability to
<br>achieve success in this matter will be substantially
<br>improved once senior Allied personnel have returned to
<br>work early in the new year.  We pledge to take the matter
<br>up expeditiously at that time.
<br>
<br>Q: Will waiting until the new year give NATO Military
<br>Authorities sufficient time to complete the revision of
<br>the EAGLE GUARDIAN?
<br>
<br>A: According to our conversations with NATO's senior
<br>military authorities, beginning the process of
<br>incorporating the Baltic states into EAGLE GUARDIAN in
<br>early January still gives them sufficient time to complete
<br>the revision by February as originally planned.
<br>
<br>¶4.  (C) Washington strongly prefers that discussion of
<br>NATO's contingency plans in general, and the possible
<br>expansion of EAGLE GUARDIAN in particular, remain in
<br>confidential channels.  However, posts may use the points
<br>below if necessary in responding to public queries about
<br>these issues.
<br>
<br>(U) PUBLIC/PRESS INQUIRIES -- IF ASKED:
<br>
<br>-- NATO does not discuss specific plans.
<br>
<br>-- As a matter of course, however, NATO does planning in
<br>order to be as prepared as possible for whatever
<br>situations might arise, particularly as relates to its
<br>ability to carrying out its Article 5 commitments.
<br>
<br>-- Plans are not static.  NATO is constantly reviewing and
<br>revising its plans.
<br>
<br>-- NATO planning, however, is an internal process designed
<br>to make the Alliance as prepared as possible for future
<br>contingencies.  It is not "aimed" at any other country.
<br>
<br>-- President Obama acknowledged this when he said at
<br>Prague that "We must work together as NATO members so that
<br>we have contingency plans in place to deal with new
<br>threats, wherever they may come from."
