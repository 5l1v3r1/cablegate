<br>¶C. MOSCOW 00180 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador John Beyrle. Reason: 1.4 (d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary. The events two weeks ago in the northwestern 
<br>town of Pikalevo, in which frustrated workers in three small, 
<br>idled plants blocked a federal highway to draw attention to 
<br>their plight, demonstrated the failures of Russia's "vertical 
<br>of power" and gave insight into the balance of power within 
<br>the elite (Ref B). That the impasse required the involvement 
<br>of Prime Minister Putin -- the man "responsible for 
<br>everything" in Russia -- illustrated the weakness of the 
<br>federal system, in which poorly connected governors have few 
<br>levers to influence the Moscow-based financial industrial 
<br>groups close to the Kremlin. Moreover, none of the 
<br>institutions designed to protect citizen interests 
<br>functioned: labor unions, political parties, or even state 
<br>institutions like the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service could not 
<br>bring about a solution (even after President Medvedev 
<br>reportedly told the Leningrad Oblast Governor Serdyukov to 
<br>fix the problem in March). Experts are divided on the logic 
<br>behind Putin's decision to make a public spectacle out of 
<br>Pikalevo, but nearly all see his involvement after an 
<br>independent demonstration by ordinary citizens as a likely 
<br>catalyst for more localized protests by other dissatisfied 
<br>groups, seeking to attract the Prime Minister's attention in 
<br>the coming months. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>The System Failed 
<br>----------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) The economic crisis is testing the "Putin system" of 
<br>administration, established during 8-years of strong economic 
<br>growth to establish central control over the county and 
<br>maintain socio-economic stability. The points of pressure are 
<br>found in widely dispersed "one-company towns" across Russia, 
<br>where less efficient and less advanced companies, 
<br>particularly in metallurgy and machine building, are failing. 
<br>As such, the chances of localized protests -- a "bunt" of 
<br>frustrated workers -- are increasing, potentially creating a 
<br>crisis of confidence within the tandem. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) The Pikalevo situation highlighted the weakness of 
<br>Russia's federal structure. After Putin's reforms, governors 
<br>serve at Moscow's pleasure and are judged less by their 
<br>effectiveness as leaders or ability to solve local problems 
<br>than by their resolute support for central authorities 
<br>(demonstrated in their management of regional elections to 
<br>secure the party of power, United Russia) and their ability 
<br>to maintain political and social stability. According to 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX, political and tax reforms over
<br>the past years have curtailed the governors' influence
<br>over the budget and reduced their authority to make
<br>decisions without Moscow's approval. 
<br>Economic prosperity, fueled by high energy prices, helped to 
<br>mask the weakening of regional leadership; the crisis had 
<br>made it more acute. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) The case with Leningrad Oblast Governor Serdyukov
<br>in connection with Pikalevo illustrates the problem of 
<br>ineffective regional leadership. XXXXXXXXXXXX blamed
<br>the Serdyukov's incompetence and the  local mayor's
<br>"unprofessionalism" for allowing the problem to  fester.
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX had a more positive assessment
<br>of Serdyukov, but noted that a "second tier" governor had no
<br>ability to tell the well-connected Deripaska what to do –
<br>- only the heavyweights had sufficient authority to challenge
<br> members of the tandem's inner circle. No matter what the
<br>assessment of Serdyukov  "the man," his loyalties remained
<br>primarily tied to keeping  Moscow's favor, leading him to cover
<br>over the deteriorating  situation in Pikalevo by emphasizing
<br>new investment projects,  like the Nissan factory that Putin
<br>opened on June 2. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX also has identified a second element
<br> that  led to Pikalevo: a crisis of dialogue between the political 
<br>leadership (vlast) and society, in which any attempt to draw 
<br>attention to serious problems are treated as a threat to the 
<br>system and the regime. XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>noted the fate of Yuriy Onoprienko, the Speaker of 
<br>the Khabarovsk Kray legislature, who was fired by United 
<br>Russia after deputies there sent a letter to Putin requesting 
<br>that tariffs for energy not be increased because of the 
<br>economic crisis. Similarly, XXXXXXXXXXXX drew the ire 
<br>of the pro-Kremlin press and almost faced charges of 
<br>"extremism" XXXXXXXXXXXX. Now, he and others who have 
<br>criticized the tandem's anti-crisis package are finding 
<br>
<br>MOSCOW 00001562 002 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>themselves vindicated, although without any recognition from 
<br>the authorities. The regime has also shown little tolerance 
<br>for criticism from society; last December Moscow-based OMON 
<br>police forces used force to dispel protests in Vladivostok 
<br>against increased tariffs on imported automobiles. Deputy 
<br>Prime Minister Igor Sechin dismissed the protests as the 
<br>actions of "scoundrels" while United Russia Duma officials 
<br>insinuated that the presence of Japanese flags by the 
<br>protesters signaled instigation from overseas (Ref C). 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Ultimately, commentators argue the crisis at Pikalevo 
<br>resulted from the shortcomings of the tandem's crisis plan, 
<br>which emphasizes maintaining employment (even with 
<br>substantially reduced salaries) over accepting the pain of 
<br>economic restructuring of inefficient and unprofitable 
<br>enterprises. XXXXXXXXXXXX told us "the factories should be 
<br>closed" and he admitted that Putin's solution does not solve 
<br>the problem of a lack of demand for aluminum -- the catalyst 
<br>behind the plants' closure. Thus far, the administration's 
<br>response has been to demand more action on the part of 
<br>regional and local leaders to follow through with the plans 
<br>to maintain employment and stop wage arrears. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) After Pikalevo, the central leadership made no 
<br>reassessment of its strategy, but instead used the whip to 
<br>put more pressure on regional leaders to follow through with 
<br>the "stability" agenda. Medvedev on June 10 threatened 
<br>regional leaders with dismissal if they fail to get wage 
<br>arrears and unemployment under control -- telling them to 
<br>"stop hiding under the table" and take charge of negotiating 
<br>with industries and workers' collectives. Kremlin ideologue 
<br>Vladislav Surkov told a conference of municipal heads that 
<br>government at all levels should become "more open" and 
<br>engaged in dialogue with society. However, as
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX  explained to us, this anti-crisis policy
<br>rests on a fragile  social compromise, in which businesses keep
<br>workers on the  books, albeit with reduced pay and hours;
<br>local and regional  elites trumpet low unemployment; and
<br>the populace patiently accepts the cuts in the hopes of 
<br>improved wages "after the  crisis." As in the Pikalevo case,
<br>that comprise can break down quickly if an owner's fears 
<br>about consequences for  letting arrears pile up or firing
<br>staff are less than the  possible gains for letting uneconomic
<br>enterprises collapse.  Ordering governors to be more assertive
<br>does little to  provide them political power to actually follow
<br>through on  the assignment, especially against powerful oligarchs. 
<br>
<br>Large and in Charge 
<br>------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Putin's intervention in Pikalevo also raised questions 
<br>about balance of power within the tandem. XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>asked why Putin, and not Medvedev, was dispatched to the town
<br>an issue that many here are  puzzling over. Some argue,
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX, that the showdown between Putin and Oleg
<br>Deripaska was staged political theater. Since the money to revive the
<br>BazelTsement came through government loans in an agreement
<br>between the two before the visit,  XXXXXXXXXXXX saw no reason
<br> for the Prime Minister to go to Pikalevo except to show the masses
<br>his ability to battle the  hated oligarchs. (XXXXXXXXXXXX also
<br>claimed that the proposal  to nationalize the three plants in Pikalevo
<br>was a conspiracy  between Deripaska and the two United Russia
<br>deputies who  drafted the proposal, since Deripaska would have loved to 
<br>unload the debt-ridden and inefficient firm on the  taxpayers.) In an
<br>earlier conversation with Embassy,  XXXXXXXXXXXX had argued
<br>that he saw Medvedev as confidently in  control and serving as "the"
<br>President of Russia, suggesting that he sees Putin's involvement as a
<br>way of asserting his continued political importance. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX's argument runs against the conventional 
<br>wisdom that Putin remains the fulcrum of power in the tandem. 
<br>Others explained the Prime Minister's intervention as another 
<br>illustration of Putin's continued position as the arbiter 
<br>amongst the Kremlin clans. Indeed, Medvedev had given 
<br>Serdyukov clear instructions to resolve the impasse over 
<br>BazelTsement in March, but did not follow through to see that 
<br>his instructions were implemented. We do not know if Medvedev 
<br>himself directed Putin to take action in Pikalevo, or was 
<br>even apprised of the Prime Minister's intentions. Whatever 
<br>the case behind the scenes, Putin's intervention provided a 
<br>clear signal to the elite and society that he remains the 
<br>tandem's decision implementer. As XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>described it,  Putin's trip to Pikalevo showed that "he's the tsar, he 
<br>decides all problems." 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) The laurels of the "tsar" come with heavy 
<br>responsibility and nearly all independent observers agree 
<br>that Putin's intervention will have the likely consequence of 
<br>
<br>MOSCOW 00001562 003 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>more localized protests. The success of the Pikalevo workers' 
<br>highway blockade provides a model for other disgruntled or 
<br>frustrated workers in other "one-company towns" to attract 
<br>top-level attention to their problems. Medvedev's caution to 
<br>the governors June 10 that the center will no longer send 
<br>"someone" to resolve local issues had far less flash than 
<br>Putin's actions on June 4. 
<br>
<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Putin's Pikalevo intervention, followed by his 
<br>surprise announcement that Russia would drop its independent 
<br>bid for WTO accession in lieu of a joint bid with Kazakhstan 
<br>and Belarus (Ref A), has put the Prime Minister in the 
<br>spotlight at the expense of Medvedev. Medvedev appears to be 
<br>playing "catch up" through his tough talk to the PolPreds 
<br>(his representatives to regional blocs) on June 10 and a 
<br>photo op sighting down the barrel of a sniper scope in 
<br>Makachkala (after the murder of the head of the local 
<br>Internal Affairs Minister). Pikalevo served to confirm the 
<br>stereotypes about the two men -- Medvedev is a man of words, 
<br>hobnobbing with Western businessmen in St. Petersburg; Putin 
<br>is the man of action, setting the oligarchs straight in the 
<br>provinces. Neither appears to see fully the systemic problems 
<br>inherent in the Putin system, but Medvedev at a minimum seems 
<br>more open to hearing a broader range of criticism. Putin 
<br>apparently retains his conspiratorial worldview, even 
<br>muttering about the Pikalevo protest being the result of 
<br>forces colluding to stop him from coming to the town. If the 
<br>situation deteriorates in the coming months with a surge of 
<br>localized protest, Medvedev may be in a better position to 
<br>promote a reform agenda that tackles the underlying issues, 
<br>rather that papering over problems with a diminishing pot of 
<br>government money.
