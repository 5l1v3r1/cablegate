<br>SUBJECT: ALLEGED ILLICIT SERBIAN ARMS SALE TO YEMENI 
<br>MILITARY, POSSIBLE UNSCR 1521 VIOLATION
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Stephen A. Seche for reasons 1.4(b) and (d)
<br>¶1. (S/NF) A front company for Serbian illicit arms dealer Slobodan Tesic (alt. Tezic),  XXXXXXXXXXXX, signed a USD 78 million arms contract with the Yemeni Ministry of Defense in early October 2009, to be delivered by early January 2010, according to the Bulgarian Embassy in Sana’a. The 34-page contract, an alleged copy of which was provided to EconOff by XXXXXXXXXXXX on December 7 and subsequently forwarded to State NEA/ARP and Washington analysts, details a package of small arms ammunition, heavy artillery ammunition, sniper rifles, demolition equipment, antiaircraft guns, and howitzers. The Bulgarian Embassy claims that XXXXXXXXXXXX, both named in the contract, are linked to Slobodan Tesic, a Serbian national listed in the travel ban annex to UNSC Resolution 1521. Tesic has made frequent trips to Yemen in the past year in connection to this contract, according to the Bulgarian Embassy. (Note: Sensitive USG reporting corroborates the claim that XXXXXXXXXXXX is a Tesic front company. End Note.) The XXXXXXXXXXXX told EconOff he was passing on information of the upcoming arms transfer, obtained through a Yemeni source in the ROYG Ministry of Defense, in the hopes of having the U.S. Government stop the sale and thus provide opportunities for Bulgarian arms manufacturers to supply similar equipment to the ROYG. The Cyprus address of record for XXXXXXXXXXXX
