<br>¶C. BRASILIA 34
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Clifford Sobel. Reason 1.5 (D)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY. The Boeing F18 Super Hornet has had
<br>success in establishing itself as a strong candidate to be
<br>Brazil's next generation fighter but still faces strong
<br>political opposition. To succeed, the USG and Boeing will
<br>need a coordinated strategy aimed at highlighting the Super
<br>Hornet's advantages, correcting misinformation and building
<br>confidence in the USG's support for the purchase. Ideally,
<br>this will involve ongoing outreach from the USG at high
<br>levels to the key Brazilian decision makers. See Paragraph 9
<br>for specific recommendations. END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) As reported in ref a, the Boeing F18 Super Hornet
<br>has become a serious option in Brazil's fighter competition,
<br>and is acknowledged by contacts in the Brazilian Air Force as
<br>offering the best plane for a competitive price. Although
<br>these factors will continue to weigh in Boeing's favor, the
<br>Super Hornet cannot at this point be considered the favorite
<br>in the competition. There continues to be a strong
<br>preconception among many in policy circles that a purchase
<br>from France would be in Brazil's best interest, a view
<br>strengthened by the recent, well-publicized visit of
<br>President Sarkozy to Rio. Even though Sarkozy did not add
<br>any new substance to the "strategic partnership" (deals to
<br>sell helicopters and submarines were already well-known), the
<br>optic of the Presidential visit has worked in Dassault's
<br>favor.
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) In the last week, there has been new focus in the
<br>Brazilian press on the fighter purchase, including some
<br>positive statements from Boeing officials and accurate
<br>reporting that the Rafale's high price and limited
<br>capabilities have caused it to lose every foreign sale for
<br>which it has thus far competed. French representatives have
<br>tried to spin the Rafale's dismal performance in the global
<br>market to be the result USG political pressure rather than
<br>the aircraft's shortcomings. The continuing challenge for
<br>Boeing in press reporting is the ongoing assumption that
<br>there is a risk to choosing the Super Hornet that the USG
<br>will exercise some sort of "veto" over the sale at a later
<br>date.
<br>
<br>ELEMENTS OF A SUCCESSFUL BID
<br>----------------------------
<br>¶4. (C) As noted in reftels, the FX2 decision will not be
<br>based on the capabilities of the aircraft selected and will
<br>only be marginally influenced by the price. Brazilian
<br>decision makers will be looking at the offers of the
<br>competitors to determine which will benefit Brazil,
<br>particularly Brazilian defense industry. Boeing, with its
<br>worldwide business and access to commercial aircraft
<br>production will have an attractive offer, but faces a
<br>challenge. Both Dassault and Saab are offering essentially
<br>new planes, not yet in production. They are therefore able
<br>to offer Brazil whatever role it wants in the fabrication of
<br>the planes, not just the final assembly that Boeing will
<br>offer.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Ref b highlighted the critical importance of
<br>technology transfer. With current efforts in Washington to
<br>approve technology sharing to the fullest extent possible, we
<br>expect Boeing will have a strong offer by the Feb. 2 deadline
<br>to respond to the Request for Proposal (RFP). It will be
<br>vital, before the final response goes forward, to ensure that
<br>it meets all Brazilian requirements. As noted in ref b, it
<br>will be critical for the Boeing offer to keep open the
<br>possibility of integrating Brazilian made weapons on the F18
<br>at some point. Given the huge emphasis the new National
<br>Defense Strategy places on support to Brazilian industry,
<br>excluding any opportunity for indigenous products to be used
<br>would be a major blow to Boeing's chances.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) It will be as important as approving the tech
<br>transfer itself to overcome the assumption that the USG can
<br>step in at a later date to restrict the transfer. While we
<br>can explain that we stopped transfer of F16s to Venezuela
<br>because of setbacks in democratic governance and interference
<br>in the security of neighboring states -- circumstances
<br>
<br>BRASILIA 00000041 002 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>unthinkable in the Brazilian context -- the Brazilians tend
<br>to take the fact that we stopped the transfer as evidence
<br>that the United States is an unreliable supplier. To combat
<br>this assumption will require ongoing high level USG
<br>assurances, both directly to the Brazilian leadership and
<br>publicly, that we can foresee no circumstance in which we
<br>would restrict the transfer of fighters to Brazil. As the
<br>State Department is perceived by Brazilians as the most
<br>likely source of a potential veto, it will be critical for
<br>high level Department involvement in this effort.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) In ref b, post reported on the Brazilian Air Force's
<br>likely requirements for financing of the new fighters. With
<br>the USG's long experience in Foreign Military sales, it
<br>should be possible to work out a set of financing
<br>arrangements that would offer an advantage over the
<br>competition, especially since Boeing believes its aircraft
<br>will have the lowest life cycle costs.
<br>
<br>KEY PLAYERS
<br>-----------
<br>¶8. (C) The strongest supporters of the Super Hornet are
<br>likely to be the military leadership, in particular Brazilian
<br>Air Force chief Brig. Junito Saito, who we believe perceive
<br>the Boeing offer as the best deal on the best aircraft and
<br>see the United States military as the better choice of a
<br>partner going forward. We may also be able to garner support
<br>from Brazilian industry, including Embraer, if Boeing can
<br>offer strong prospects for longer-term cooperation and mutual
<br>profit. While the initial review of the proposals will be
<br>done by the Air Force, final decisions will be made at higher
<br>levels of the Brazilian government. The final decision will
<br>be made by President Lula, who is likely to take a more
<br>pragmatic view of which offer would most benefit Brazil, but
<br>will also be swayed by arguments regarding how the purchase
<br>will affect Brazil's standing as an independent global power.
<br>In making a recommendation to Lula, Defense Minister Jobim
<br>will play the key role at the policy level. While Jobim has
<br>a good relationship with the USG, he has been a strong public
<br>supporter of the strategic partnership with France. Foreign
<br>Minister Amorim and Minister for Strategic Planning Roberto
<br>Mangabeira Unger will also have a say; both see a purchase
<br>from the U.S. as leading to an undesirable "dependency."
<br>Finally, presidential advisors, including Civilian Household
<br>Minister Dilma Rousseff and Foreign Policy Advisor Marco
<br>Aurelio Garcia, will likely serve as sounding boards for Lula
<br>as he makes a decision.
<br>
<br>RECOMMENDATIONS
<br>---------------
<br>¶9. (C) As we look to the next three to four months as the
<br>key period in which the fighter competition may be won, there
<br>are several opportunities for the USG to maximize our chances:
<br>
<br>-- The key step for the USG over the next month will be to
<br>get the question of technology transfer right. While the
<br>Brazilians will not get the keys to the proverbial candy
<br>store, there should be enough sweeteners in Boeing's offer to
<br>make the case that the Super Hornet includes the best tech.
<br>The offer must also address the key points raised in ref b
<br>(source codes, weapons integration, etc.).
<br>
<br>-- Once the RFP response is in, we should be prepared to
<br>raise the FX2 at every high level contact with Brazil. There
<br>has been a perception that USG support is weak that needs to
<br>be countered. The most effective way of doing so would be to
<br>have President Obama make a strong statement advocating the
<br>Super Hornet to President Lula at the earliest opportunity.
<br>The President Elect's outstanding popularity with Brazilians,
<br>the personal affinity that Lula has publicly expressed, and
<br>the high expectations for relations with the new U.S.
<br>Administration will ensure that his advocacy will have an
<br>impact.
<br>
<br>-- We should follow up the RFP response submission with
<br>visits from appropriate officials to reassure the Brazilian
<br>government of USG support for Boeing's proposal. Ideally,
<br>this would begin with an interagency team (State, OSD, DTSA,
<br>SOUTHCOM) visit in February at Assistant Secretary level to
<br>try to put to rest the notion that there could be a USG veto.
<br>Visits should include a public diplomacy component.
<br>
<br>-- Government to government efforts should be supplemented
<br>
<br>BRASILIA 00000041 003 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>by improved outreach to highlight the advantages of the Super
<br>Hornet and counter misinformation campaigns from the other
<br>competitors that the USG will not be a reliable partner.
<br>
<br>-- Washington agencies should be prepared to receive BRAF
<br>finance representatives in February to discus likely
<br>Brazilian requirements.
