<br>SUBJECT: PRESIDENT SALEH TO A/S BLOOMFIELD "NO NEW MANPADS" 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Thomas C. Krajeski; reasons 1.4 (b), (d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary. Assistant Secretary of State for Political 
<br>Military Affairs Lincoln P. Bloomfield Jr. discussed proposed 
<br>U.S. MANPADS buyback and destruction initiative with Yemeni 
<br>President Ali Abdullah Saleh on September 1. Saleh not only 
<br>agreed to move forward with the modalities of the buyback, 
<br>but pledged to A/S that the ROYG would not seek to buy any 
<br>new systems. Despite Saleh's attempt to extract more money 
<br>out of the buyback offer, Post expects/hopes to conclude an 
<br>agreement in the next two weeks. A/S Bloomfield's August 31 
<br>meeting with Minister of Interior al-Alimi, Chief of Military 
<br>Staff al Qassemi, and National Security Bureau Saleh covered 
<br>septel. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br>Saleh -- "We Have to Get Them Off the Market" 
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) A/S Lincoln P. Bloomfield Jr. and Ambassador met 
<br>with Yemeni President Saleh on September 1 to discuss the 
<br>proposed U.S. MANPADS buyback initiative. Saleh welcomed A/S 
<br>Bloomfield's visit and the MANPADS initiative, describing it 
<br>as part of continuing U.S. - Yemeni joint security efforts in 
<br>the Arabian Gulf and the Middle East. A/S Bloomfield thanked 
<br>the President for his country's cooperation and partnership 
<br>in the GWOT, emphasizing that MANPADS in particular pose a 
<br>grave threat to U.S. and Yemeni global security interests 
<br>should they fall into terrorist hands. Saleh readily agreed, 
<br>adding "these weapons in the hands of al Qa'ida or Jihadists 
<br>threaten Yemen's security forces. We have to get them off 
<br>the market." 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) A/S Bloomfield outlined the MANPADS buyback 
<br>initiative, explaining it was a very specific proposal to 
<br>purchase and destroy systems collected by the ROYG. In 
<br>addition to compensation for each system, U.S. technical 
<br>training and assistance would be provided to ensure the 
<br>safety of MANPADS collection and transportation, and to 
<br>conduct destruction. A/S Bloomfield stressed that there was 
<br>a 90-day window in which to buy and destroy current ROYG 
<br>illicit stocks, and that while the program did not have a 
<br>time limit -- the funding was, indeed, finite. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) Saleh told A/S Bloomfield that the ROYG was 
<br>currently in possession of 1435 MANPADS including 500 he had 
<br>recently collected from "private people" just prior to his 
<br>departure to London for an official visit on September 25. 
<br>The President made clear that these systems would be offered 
<br>up for sale and destruction according to the proposed 
<br>initiative, adding that he estimated there were another 150 - 
<br>200 still in private hands which the ROYG is targeted for 
<br>collection. (Note: On August 31 A/S Bloomfield viewed 79 
<br>recovered MANPADS stored in a MOD facility. The 1435 appear 
<br>to be some combination of these 79, plus the other 1029 
<br>emboffs observed in the same facility in 2003, and a number 
<br>of other illicit systems we were unaware had been collected. 
<br>We will seek clarification on these numbers from NSB Deputy 
<br>Director Ammar Saleh. End Note.) 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) President Saleh assured A/S he was serious about 
<br>cutting off the possibility of MANPADS leakage from official 
<br>stocks. He said he had given the order to collect all 
<br>systems from the Yemeni Armed Forces in the field and return 
<br>them to storage immediately. A/S commended the President's 
<br>actions to get "these dangerous missiles out of dangerous 
<br>hands," emphasizing that Yemeni MANPADS must remain under the 
<br>lock and key of the authorities. "Actually," Saleh 
<br>responded, "we don't need them." 
<br>
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>Saleh Promises No New MANPADS... 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Saleh pledged to A/S Bloomfield that Yemen's 
<br>national defense did not require MANPADS; to the contrary, 
<br>the current crisis in Sa'da proves "it was a big mistake" to 
<br>allow such weapons to fall into the hands of our enemies 
<br>where they can be used against our own forces. "I assure 
<br>you," said the President, "there will be no new deals, we 
<br>will not trade in them." Bloomfield responded, "you have 
<br>made a very important statement, that MANPADS are more useful 
<br>to terrorists than to your military." 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) A/S told Saleh he is engaged in ongoing discussions 
<br>with source country governments in Eastern Europe to stop 
<br>exporting MANPADS, but that we have indications arms dealers 
<br>claiming to represent Yemen continue to shop in these markets 
<br>for advanced MANPADS. Saleh advised, "You cannot prevent 
<br>(North) Korea, China, Ukraine, Russia, or Belarus from 
<br>producing or selling weapons. I do not believe you will be 
<br>successful." "Although," he continued, "maybe you can 
<br>convince them to sell through official government contracts 
<br>and not through brokers." A/S Bloomfield agreed that 
<br>controlling weapons production was not easy, but explained 
<br>that arms firms in nations working with the U.S. to limit 
<br>production of MANPADS report that Yemen remains a potential 
<br>client. "No," replied Saleh, we do not need them." 
<br>
<br>¶8. (S) A/S Bloomfield asked the President "if our friends 
<br>in Eastern Europe tell me they have a contract with Yemen, 
<br>may I tell them 'no, you do not'"?. Saleh replied. "yes, 
<br>tell them the contract is canceled -- stop it -- no one has a 
<br>deal to sell such weapons to Yemen unless they talk to me." 
<br>A/S replied that Saleh's pledge not to acquire new MANPADS 
<br>should not be underestimated, as it would enhance Yemen's 
<br>reputation in Washington and the international community. 
<br>
<br>
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br>...In Exchange for One Million Dollars 
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) "Rest assured," Saleh continued, "Yemen will not 
<br>have such weapons anymore, but everything has a price. You 
<br>will have to pay...one million dollars for each strela!" 
<br>(Note: After an awkward silence, Saleh laughed, indicated he 
<br>was exaggerating, and promised the price would come down. In 
<br>fear some uncertainty remained, the Palace translator turned 
<br>to A/S saying, "I feel it is my duty to make sure you 
<br>understand this is a joke." End Note.) "How much are you 
<br>willing to pay?" pressed the President. A/S responded that 
<br>that the price for each MANPAD was fixed and not negotiable. 
<br>"Fixed, but well above what we believe to be the market 
<br>price." 
<br>
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>Al-Houthi - Lessons Learned 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶10. (S) Saleh told A/S that the recent events in Sa'da, 
<br>(where ROYG forces are embroiled in an increasingly bloody 
<br>fight against the well-equipped supporters of rebel Shi'ite 
<br>cleric al-Houthi) has proven that it was a "big mistake" to 
<br>allow these weapons to reach enemy hands. Saleh reported to 
<br>A/S that 250 soldiers had been killed and 1000-1500 injured 
<br>in addition to 300-350 rebels. (Note: Post believes the 
<br>number of ROYG casualties to be much higher. End Note.) 
<br>
<br>¶11. (S) A/S Bloomfield replied that the U.S. was aware of 
<br>the cost to Yemen of the recent fighting and that "this hurts 
<br>us too." A/S told Saleh that the Embassy is looking to see 
<br>how else we can help. 
<br>
<br>----------------------- 
<br>...And the Kitchen Sink 
<br>----------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶12. (S) As expected, Saleh raised extending the buyback to 
<br>include other types of weapons. He reported that the ROYG 
<br>has been buying back all types from the grey market since 
<br>9/11, including SA-2 and SA-3 surface-to-air missiles, 
<br>machine-guns, anti-tank missiles, mines, RPGs, and 
<br>explosives. "We have already paid 9 billion rials 
<br>(approximately 49 million USD) to keep these weapons out of 
<br>al Qa'ida hands," claimed the President we are ready to 
<br>destroy them. We hope you will not limit the program to 
<br>MANPADS." (Note: the ROYG claims it has collected 32 million 
<br>USD in assorted SW/LA and is seeking to recover this expense. 
<br>Although we doubt the claim of 32 million, we understand 
<br>from MOD and NSB contacts that the ROYG has yet to reimburse 
<br>the arms dealers it contracted to collect these weapons and 
<br>Minister of Defense Alaiwa is under considerable pressure to 
<br>make good on the deal. End Note.) 
<br>
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>Inventory Control Assistance 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶14. (S) A/S emphasized that the program on the table is 
<br>urgent and specific; it targets several countries with large 
<br>numbers of these dangerous systems. He stressed that the 
<br>current proposal is for MANPADS only, and he is offering to 
<br>buy them for significantly more than market price. "We hope 
<br>that this important first step will be completed as soon as 
<br>possible," said A/S, adding, that he was prepared to explore 
<br>ways the U.S. can assist the ROYG in controlling its official 
<br>stocks such as providing inventory controls, computer 
<br>systems, stockpile security, and training. Saleh replied 
<br>that he looked forward to learning the details of this 
<br>assistance. 
<br>
<br>----------------------- 
<br>Give Us Our Spare Parts 
<br>----------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) Saleh complained to A/S of ongoing licensing 
<br>difficulties which had grounded F-5's, and Augusta 
<br>helicopters, and rendered M-60 Tanks and M109 artillery 
<br>inoperable. "We have made request after request," he said, 
<br>"Why doesn't the U.S. respond?" The President repeated a 
<br>common theme, telling A/S Bloomfield that he pays a high 
<br>political price in the region and internally for his CT 
<br>cooperation with the U.S. "Our cooperation" he said will be 
<br>commensurate with yours, "As much as you move, we will move." 
<br>
<br>¶16. (S) A/S Bloomfield responded that the USG appreciates its 
<br>cooperative relationship with Yemen in the GWOT, and pointed 
<br>out that, "as a demonstration of our trust, yesterday I gave 
<br>Military Chief of Staff Qassemi a C-130 licensing agreement." 
<br>"No, interrupted Saleh, "that is a transport plane. We need 
<br>our F-5 in Sa'da." A/S assured the President that he would 
<br>personally look at each Yemeni licensing request when he 
<br>returned to Washington and would make sure that they received 
<br>full consideration. (Note: When A/S Bloomfield handed the 
<br>C-130 license to Chief of Staff Qassemi on August 31, the 
<br>General said sarcastically "these few parts to a transport 
<br>plane represent the biggest step forward in our military to 
<br>military cooperation in years." End Note.) 
<br>
<br>------------------------------ 
<br>Comment: "What, Won't Haggle?" 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶17. (S) All joking aside, Saleh appears serious in trying 
<br>to push up the price per system. It is hard to imagine a 
<br>shrewd operator like the President paying more than market 
<br>price for Strela 2's, approximately 2000 USD. It would be 
<br>true to style for Saleh to try to extract as much possible 
<br>from the USG in exchange for his security cooperation. On 
<br>the margins of the meeting, NSB Deputy Director, and Saleh's 
<br>nephew, Ammar Saleh recommended A/S Bloomfield send the 
<br>President a follow-up letter to our meeting listing other 
<br>benefits to Yemen that may result from the agreement, and 
<br>urging him not to break the deal over prices that cannot/will 
<br>not change. End Comment.
