<br>SUMMARY 
<br>-------- 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Assistant Minister of Defense Prince Khalid bin Sultan 
<br>announced in a new conference yesterday (Dec. 22) that Saudi 
<br>Arabia's main military operations in the Yemeni border area 
<br>had ceased, that the Saudi military had full control of the 
<br>border area, and that military activity was now focused on 
<br>expelling remaining intruders. His statement is the first 
<br>official indication that the fighting might be winding down; 
<br>senior Embassy contacts in the Saudi Ministry of Defense as 
<br>recently as yesterday were stressing the ongoing urgency of 
<br>resupplying aircraft munitions. Prince Khalid also gave the 
<br>first official accounting of Saudi casualties since early 
<br>November: 73 dead, 470 wounded, and 26 missing. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>Saudi Arabia Declares Victory 
<br>-------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) During a tour of the Saudi-Yemeni border area 
<br>yesterday Prince Khaled Bin Sultan, Assistant Minister of 
<br>Defense and Aviation, announced to local reporters that the 
<br>Saudi military was now in full control of the border area and 
<br>that its main operations had ended. "What we are doing now is 
<br>bringing things to normal," he said, and that Saudi forces 
<br>would remain in the area with a mission of removing any 
<br>remaining "infiltrators." Prince Khalid also provided the 
<br>first official accounting of Saudi casualties since early 
<br>November: 73 dead, 470 wounded, and 26 missing. The Embassy 
<br>has been hearing rumors circulating over the past two weeks 
<br>that King Abdullah was increasingly upset that the military 
<br>campaign had not been wrapped up. Thus political pressure 
<br>may have been a factor in the timing of Prince Khalid's 
<br>announcement, but given the gravity and urgency with which 
<br>the Saudis viewed the challenge from the Houthis, Prince 
<br>Khalid's announcement suggests that the Saudi leadership is 
<br>now convinced that sufficient punishment had been inflicted 
<br>upon the Houthis to have taught them a lesson and to put an 
<br>end to their border harrassments. 
<br>
<br>Is it Really Over? 
<br>-------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) The Embassy DAO was told by senior Saudi Air Force 
<br>officers on December 22 that Saudi fighter aircraft had 
<br>continued to launch attack against Houthi targets in recent 
<br>days, sustaining the high tempo that started in the second 
<br>week of November. Saudi television was airing footage as 
<br>recently as December 21 showing Saudi tanks and artillery 
<br>firing in the border area, and Saudi soldiers launching 
<br>mortars and firing machine guns. A digest of other key press 
<br>reports from recent days is below: 
<br>
<br>-- (U) Military Successes: Saudi media continue to report 
<br>victories, describing in general terms how Saudi forces were 
<br>&repelling attacks8 or &pursuing infiltrators and 
<br>inflicting heavy losses.8 The Dec. 21 Saudi Gazette 
<br>headline boasted of 30 infiltrators killed. Al-Sharq 
<br>al-Awsat quoted a military source on Dec. 21 saying that 
<br>Saudi forces successfully destroyed a series of caves that 
<br>the infiltrators were using to store weapons and ammunition, 
<br>but could comment no further than to say that combing 
<br>operations continue on the ground while F-15 and Apache 
<br>aircraft continue air raids. 
<br>
<br>-- (U) Religious Support for Saudi Forces: Saudi Press 
<br>Agency ) 12/18/09: The Grand Mufti, Sheikh Abulaziz 
<br>Al-Sheikh, addressed Saudi forces saying, &Mujahedeen 
<br>Brothers, I salute your courage ( and congratulate you on 
<br>your Jihad for the sake of Allah. You are facing a corrupt 
<br>
<br>RIYADH 00001667 002.2 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>and astray enemy of deviant thoughts.8 The Mufti went on to 
<br>say that the actions of the armed forces are the highest 
<br>deeds of Islam. (Comment: This statement of support by the 
<br>KSA,s highest religious authority seeks to reinforce the 
<br>message that the truest form of jihad is fighting to defend 
<br>the nation, and to remind that those who seek to bring the 
<br>nation down are deviant in their thoughts. End Comment.) 
<br>
<br>-- (U) Border Security: Arab News Online ) 12/16/09: 
<br>Normalcy Restored at Border, The Saudi military announced 
<br>that 127,875 infiltrators and 2,206 smugglers have been 
<br>arrested over the past six months on the Saudi-Yemeni border. 
<br>&Saudi forces also seized a number of weapons and 14,000 
<br>rounds of ammunition. Forces foiled attempts to smuggle 30kg 
<br>of gunpowder and explosives, eight sticks of dynamite and 
<br>large quantities of narcotic substances in 2,140 cars.8 
<br>(COMMENT: The six month time period and large number of 
<br>&infiltrators8 arrested make these statistics appear more 
<br>closely related to routine border patrol operations than 
<br>directly with the fight against the Houthis. This 
<br>announcement seems intended to show strong Saudi control over 
<br>the border, rather than make a statement about fighting 
<br>infiltrators., End comment.) 
<br>
<br>-- (S/NF) Report from the Houthi Side: Al-Minbar 
<br>(pro-Houthi website) and other Houthi sources over the past 
<br>week continued to claim that U.S. and Saudi aircraft were 
<br>conducting airstrikes on innocent villages. Houthi sources 
<br>report 54 Yemeni deaths from a Dec. 20 Saudi air attack and 
<br>70 deaths from an attack on Dec. 13. These reports could not 
<br>be verified; Yemeni officials continue to deny that any Saudi 
<br>planes have strayed into Yemeni airspace. (Comment: a senior 
<br>Saudi Air Force officer confirmed to the Embassy DAO that 
<br>Saudi aircraft have been operating in northern Yemen with the 
<br>Yemeni government's approval and facilitation.) 
<br>
<br>(U) On Dec. 18, Al-Minbar claimed another successful Houthi 
<br>attack on a Saudi military post in Quwwa village &expelling 
<br>the Saudi Army and seizing its military equipment , 
<br>communication and surveillance devices and military vehicles 
<br>that soldiers left behind.8 The statement on Al-Minbar went 
<br>on to justify the Houthi attack against the Saudi forces, 
<br>explaining &We do not aim to take control over any part of 
<br>the Saudi territories. However, we are forced to chase the 
<br>aggressor wherever it carries out attacks against us. This 
<br>comes in retaliation for its continuous aggression against 
<br>civilians in the northern governorates.8 
<br>
<br>Iran: Still the Bogeyman? 
<br>-------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) The tacit cease-fire in the Saudi-Iranian war of words 
<br>over the Yemen border war seems to be holding. The Embassy 
<br>saw unofficial reports on the internet earlier this week that 
<br>Iranian Parliament Speaker Larijani might visit Riyadh today 
<br>(The Embassy has not been able to confirm these reports.) 
<br>Nonetheless, senior Saudi military and civilian officials 
<br>seem to uniformly share the conviction that Iran's 
<br>machinations are the only plausible explanation for why the 
<br>Houthis would have engaged in a fight with the Saudis that 
<br>they were bound to lose. Saudi military officials also point 
<br>to the improved training and battle tactics of the Houthi, 
<br>their deep reserves of weaponry, and several large stores of 
<br>money discovered in Houthi areas as further compelling 
<br>evidence of Iran's active support. 
<br>
<br>What's Next 
<br>---------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) The days ahead should tell whether there is a 
<br>significant stand down in Saudi military operations. Our 
<br>assessment is that the Saudi Land Forces have largely 
<br>established secure positions along the troubled area of the 
<br>Saudi-Yemeni border and that their shooting engagements have 
<br>for the most part trailed off into patrolling and monitoring 
<br>operations. Saudi air operations to patrol the border and 
<br>strike Houthi targets near the border and into Yemen will 
<br>likely continue for days or perhaps weeks, until the Saudis 
<br>are comfortable that Yemeni government forces have the 
<br>capability to suppress any Houthi activity near the border. 
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Lessons from the Battlefield 
<br>----------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) The last 50 days of Saudi-Houthi fighting have 
<br>arguably been the most significant Saudi military engagements 
<br>since the tribal battles that Abdulaziz that fought to 
<br>establish the Saudi kingdom. The Houthi battles will be 
<br>intensively studied in the months ahead, including how they 
<br>revealed Saudi military shortcomings. The Saudi military, 
<br>particularly the Air Force, resorted to the use of enormous 
<br>firepower (despite low munitions inventories) that proved to 
<br>be inadequately precise and minimally effective against 
<br>fighters maneuvering and dug into rugged mountain terrain. 
<br>Among questions that merit attention will be to what extent 
<br>should the Saudi military restructure itself to respond to 
<br>such asymmetrical threats, why the Saudis responded to the 
<br>Houthi challenge as such an urgent existential threat, and 
<br>whether the perceived inability or unwillingness of the U.S. 
<br>to more rapidly provide emergency munitions resupply to the 
<br>Saudis in their perceived hour of need will ramifications for 
<br>our military to military partnership. These and related 
<br>issues will be the focus of forthcoming Embassy analyses.
