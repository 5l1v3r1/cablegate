<br>Classified By: Ambassador Cellucci, reasons 1.4 (b) (d)
<br>
<br>Summary and Key Themes
<br>----------------------
<br>
<br>¶1. (C/NF) The Canadian Government and the Embassy strongly
<br>welcome your visit and the opportunities it will afford to
<br>advance our broad bilateral relationship.  The two key themes
<br>I would stress for your visit are partnership and
<br>reassurance.  The Canadians need to be reassured that at the
<br>end of the day, whatever tactical disagreements we may have
<br>over Iraq and individual trade cases, we are firmly united
<br>across the world,s longest undefended border by common
<br>values, shared political heritage, and the largest bilateral
<br>trading relationship in the planet,s history.  We need to
<br>send the message that we value Canada with no strings
<br>attached.  The early timing of this visit will help make this
<br>point.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C/NF) Specifically, it would be very helpful if you came
<br>to Ottawa with three key public messages.  First, a positive
<br>signal demonstrating movement on BSE, short of resolution but
<br>beyond &we,re working on it.8  A firm date for completion
<br>of the regulation would give PM Martin a huge political boost
<br>and help beleaguered Canadian ranchers get through the
<br>winter.  Second, appreciation for the positive role Canadians
<br>play in the world as peacekeepers and in transmitting our
<br>shared political and cultural values to failed and failing
<br>states.  And third, personal thanks for our close cooperation
<br>in defending the continent against terrorism, both in border
<br>security, and in the larger fight to roll back the
<br>availability of weapons of mass destruction, contain the
<br>activities of terrorist groups, and support development that
<br>will provide alternatives to terrorism.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C/NF) Several themes about the future would also be
<br>helpful for your private meetings.  You should note the
<br>substantial Canadian support to date for Iraq reconstruction
<br>and encourage Canada to play a larger role in the development
<br>of political and security institutions there.  You should
<br>promise continued close cooperation in places such as Sudan,
<br>Afghanistan, and Haiti, and solicit PM Martin,s views on how
<br>to best synergize our efforts.  And finally, you should
<br>commit to focus on settling our trade and environmental
<br>disputes.  End Summary
<br>
<br>Martin,s Minority Government Stable, but Weak
<br>---------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) After governing in majority for ten years, the Liberal
<br>Party called elections June 28 to gain a mandate for PM
<br>Martin, who succeeded Jean Chretien in December 2003.  The
<br>Liberals were hurt by a scandal involving the disbursement of
<br>public monies in Quebec, and the Martin government was
<br>reduced to minority status, the first in Canada since 1979.
<br>In the first week of Parliament, Martin was able to loosely
<br>win over the New Democratic Party, putting him neck-and-neck
<br>with the Conservatives and the separatist Bloc Quebecois.
<br>Both the Liberal-NDP and the Conservative-Bloc alignments are
<br>very tentative, however, and different issue-driven
<br>coalitions are likely to emerge on an ad hoc basis.
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) Predictions on how long the government will last
<br>range from six months to two years.  Canadians do not want to
<br>go to the polls soon and the Government and Opposition know
<br>it.  But given the nature of Canada,s political system, the
<br>Government,s fall is never more than one bad decision away.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C/NF) The Liberal's thin margin leads Martin to exercise
<br>extreme caution, which some observers are now touting as weak
<br>leadership.  The PM has made it clear that he will not try to
<br>carry out an aggressive agenda, and on issues such as missile
<br>defense, would just as soon wait rather than try to tackle it
<br>now and risk a negative vote.
<br>
<br>Seeking Canada,s Place in the World
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) All of this is taking place in the context of a
<br>certain amount of soul-searching here on Canada,s decline
<br>from &middle power8 status to that of an &active
<br>observer8 of global affairs, a trend which some Canadians
<br>believe should be reversed.  In the short term the country,s
<br>priorities are improving the quality of life for Canadian
<br>citizens and there is little support for increasing defense
<br>spending (currently among the lowest per capita in NATO) or
<br>the foreign affairs budget.  PM Martin has promised to focus
<br>his government on policies to perpetuate the &Canadian
<br>economic miracle,8 help cities, improve health care, and
<br>provide easier access to child-care.  However, he has also
<br>made modest increases in the defense budget and has announced
<br>plans to add 5,000 troops to the armed forces.
<br>
<br>Engagement on Homeland Security
<br>-------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU) Within the constraints of weak public support and
<br>low funding, PM Martin has made his foreign affairs and
<br>homeland security bureaucracies more capable and has kept
<br>Canada selectively active in global issues.  In the wake of
<br>the September 11 attacks, Canada has implemented a range of
<br>practical measures that improve Canada,s homeland security
<br>while facilitating the flow of people and commerce across our
<br>common border.  Starting with the December 2001 Smart Border
<br>Action Plan with the U.S., changes include enhancements to
<br>aviation security, full compliance with UN and other
<br>multilateral conventions, and strengthening of financial
<br>controls.  In the fall of 2003 Canada undertook an aggressive
<br>reorganization of its security and border agencies,
<br>consolidating them into a structure similar to that of DHS,
<br>and in April 2004 rolled out its first-ever national security
<br>strategy.  Bilateral efforts have resulted in better
<br>information sharing, joint targeting, and smoother flow of
<br>low-risk traffic.
<br>
<br>¶9. (S/NF) A potential irritant on the Canadian side that may
<br>be raised has to do with sharing of intelligence regarding
<br>Iraq operations.  The government is aware that we are
<br>creating a separate US-UK-Australia channel for sharing
<br>sensitive intelligence, including information that
<br>trationally has been U.S. eyes only.  The GOC has expressed
<br>concern at multiple levels that their exclusion from a
<br>traditional "four-eyes" construct is "punishment" for
<br>Canada,s non-participation in Iraq and they fear that the
<br>Iraq-related channel may evolve into a more permanent
<br>"three-eyes" only structure.  PM Martin may raise this with
<br>you privately.
<br>
<br>A Modest but Effective Agenda on Global Affairs
<br>--------------------------------------------- --
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) PM Martin has also kept Canada in the game
<br>internationally.  In 2002 Ottawa sent 750 soldiers to
<br>Afghanistan where they served with distinction in Khandahar,
<br>and Canada led the maritime task force monitoring movement in
<br>the Persian Gulf, a service that began with an eye on
<br>Afghanistan but later was useful in the lead-up to Operation
<br>Iraqi Freedom.  Ottawa continued to support democratization
<br>in Afghanistan, leading the ISAF mission from February to
<br>August 2004, and contributing 2,300 of 7,100 troops.  Canada
<br>has been active in development and elections support for
<br>Afghanistan, committing USD 500 million to a wide-variety of
<br>programs through 2009.  Finally, Canada has pledged to deploy
<br>a Provincial Reconstruction Team, possibly to Khandahar, in
<br>the fall of 2005.
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) In Haiti, Canada has provided civilian police
<br>officers, a sizable aid budget, and positive involvement in
<br>diplomatic efforts on the ground.  Canada has been largely in
<br>synch with our efforts to seek a durable solution to Sudan,s
<br>current and chronic crisis.  PM Martin, who met with
<br>President al-Bashir in Sudan last week, supports the
<br>&responsibility to protect8 as an obligation of each
<br>government and a core function of the international community
<br>through the United Nations.  Canada has allocated US$16
<br>million to support the African Union in Sudan.
<br>¶12. (SBU) Despite opposition to our invasion of Iraq, Canada
<br>has offered strong support for Iraqi reconstruction, saying
<br>"we can't afford to fail."  The GOC quickly committed funds,
<br>pledging about US$ 240 million in Madrid, and made active
<br>efforts to leverage contributions from countries that were
<br>initially hesitant.  Over two-thirds of Canada's aid has been
<br>allocated and over half has been disbursed on projects such
<br>as police trainers in Jordan. Canada also supports Paris Club
<br>efforts on debt reduction.
<br>
<br>Trade and the Border: Vital Links for Canada
<br>--------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶13. (SBU) The U.S. and Canada have the largest bilateral
<br>trade relationship in the history of the world and over 95%
<br>of that trade is trouble-free.  The billion dollars a day in
<br>trade with the U.S. generates about a third of Canada,s GDP,
<br>with energy exports and the integrated North American auto
<br>industry dominating the picture.
<br>¶14. (SBU) Since implementation of NAFTA ten years ago,
<br>US-Canada trade has doubled.  Most Canadians see NAFTA as a
<br>success but are frustrated by its limits, thrown into relief
<br>by U.S. trade remedy actions on softwood lumber and pork.
<br>Expectations that NAFTA would give Canadians greater control
<br>over US actions have largely been disappointed.  The softwood
<br>case remains a long-running and intractable irritant; even
<br>so, Canadian lumber exports boomed last year in response to
<br>US housing demand.
<br>
<br>¶15. (SBU) There are trade disputes and then there is beef.
<br>Reopening the border to trade in live cattle is Canada's most
<br>pressing bilateral concern and our top priority for this
<br>visit.  Cut out of our highly integrated North American
<br>market since 2003, Canadian ranchers have lost over $2
<br>billion to date.  Canada has spent $400 million on relief for
<br>the cattle industry, but many farmers and their suppliers may
<br>not survive another winter. Indefinite delays and the
<br>perceived unpredictability of the U.S. regulatory process
<br>have soured views of the U.S. in some of the most
<br>traditionally pro-American regions of Canada.  Issuance of
<br>the new rule, or at least a firm commitment to a date for
<br>completion, would help restore public confidence and give the
<br>GoC some political room to respond to other U.S. priorities.
<br>In the long term, failure to resolve the problem will result
<br>in two North American beef industries, reducing efficiencies
<br>and stiffening competition in traditional US export markets.
<br>Significantly, movement on beef will give Martin political
<br>space to cooperate more on security.
<br>
<br>¶16. (U) Canada enjoys an enviable economic situation, with
<br>steady budget surpluses and the most sharply-reduced debt
<br>burden in the G-7.  Although the economic outlook is rosy,
<br>the currency's rapid appreciation against the U.S dollar,
<br>driven partly by rising commodity prices, could put a damper
<br>on exports, and there are concerns here about global
<br>imbalances and the sustainability of the U.S. economic
<br>recovery.  Even with strong economic fundamentals, Canadian
<br>GDP growth is projected to lag that of the U.S. in 2004.
<br>
<br>¶17. (U) In addition to worries about exchange rate risk and
<br>perennial trade disputes, Canadians feel increasingly
<br>vulnerable to &border risk8.  Exporters worry about
<br>lengthening border delays due to infrastructure overload and
<br>to tighter security measures such as prior notice
<br>requirements.  Application of USVISIT fingerprint and photo
<br>requirements to Canadian non-citizen residents, and the
<br>possibility that eventually Canadians will require passports
<br>to enter the U.S., have sparked public anxiety among
<br>Canadians.  Businesses fear that future terrorist incidents
<br>could lead to catastrophic border closings and strongly
<br>support the GoC,s efforts to strengthen bilateral security
<br>cooperation.  Continued DHS engagement with Canada via the
<br>Smart Border Action Plan, the Ridge-McLellan dialogue, and
<br>regular working-level meetings, is a key element in managing
<br>this anxiety and addressing underlying problems.  The GoC is
<br>pushing to accelerate progress and add to the &Smart
<br>Border8 agenda in its version of the North American
<br>Initiative, &Beyond Smart Borders8.
<br>
<br>Energy Inter-Dependency
<br>-----------------------
<br>
<br>¶18. (U) Canada is by far the United States' largest foreign
<br>source of energy.  It is our largest supplier of petroleum,
<br>as well as our leading external source of natural gas,
<br>uranium, and electric power.  With Alberta,s oil sands now
<br>classified as &proven reserves,8 Canada,s petroleum
<br>resources of 180 billion barrels are second only to Saudi
<br>Arabia,s.
<br>
<br>¶19. (U) Canada,s northern territories contain large energy
<br>resources, notably natural gas deposits in the delta of the
<br>Mackenzie River, several hundred miles east of Alaska,s
<br>Prudhoe Bay.  The energy industry expects that two gas
<br>pipelines will be built, one from the Mackenzie Delta and the
<br>other from Alaska,s North Slope.  As the regulatory
<br>framework for the Alaska line develops, industry will have to
<br>determine the pipeline,s exact route both in Alaska and as
<br>it passes through Canada.
<br>
<br>¶20. (U) Canada's electric power sector is interconnected at
<br>numerous points with the U.S. grid and has for decades been a
<br>large supplier of power to the U.S. market.  The U.S./Canada
<br>Joint Task Force that investigated the August 2003 power
<br>outage recommended the creation of a North American Electric
<br>Reliability Organization, which would implement mandatory
<br>standards for electricity transmission in both countries.
<br>Canadian players in this industry are intensely interested in
<br>the shape of proposed U.S. energy legislation, as it affects
<br>their future strategies.
<br>
<br>Environmental Issues
<br>--------------------
<br>
<br>¶21. (U) The U.S. and Canada cooperate closely on a broad
<br>range of environmental issues. Together we have made
<br>significant progress on key issues, including trans-boundary
<br>air and water pollution, regulation of pesticides and
<br>chemicals and protection of the Great Lakes.
<br>
<br>¶22. (C) There are, however, a number of thorny cross-border
<br>water issues still unresolved, including Canadian demands
<br>that the U.S. move a derelict fishing vessel (Victoria M)
<br>mistakenly scuttled in Canadian waters, controversy over the
<br>proposed clean-up of pollution of the Columbia River from a
<br>Canadian smelter in British Columbia and North Dakota,s
<br>plans to mitigate flooding at Devils Lake by pumping water
<br>through a canal system to the Red River.
<br>
<br>¶23. (C) The Canadians have raised these issues before at
<br>senior levels and are likely to do so again.  The most
<br>pressing of these problems is Devils Lake, where Canada
<br>believes that the state outlet from the lake to the Red River
<br>would violate the Boundary Waters Treaty.  North Dakota has
<br>almost completed its canal system and plans to start pumping
<br>water in the spring of 2005.  Canada has asked for U.S.
<br>agreement to &refer8 this issue to the International Joint
<br>Commission for study and recommendations, but we have not yet
<br>responded to that request.  The Embassy believes it would be
<br>in our interest to agree to a &reference,8 tightly limited
<br>in scope and time-frame.
<br>
<br>¶24. (U) Canada formally ratified the Kyoto Accord at the end
<br>of 2002, despite vocal opposition from some provincial
<br>governments and industries.  While political approaches to
<br>the climate change issue have differed between the U.S. and
<br>Canada, practical cooperation has been close.  In 2002, we
<br>signed agreements on Renewable Energy and Climate Science,
<br>and formed a bilateral Working Group on Climate Change.  Few
<br>Canadians understand just how much we do on climate change,
<br>reducing U.S. efforts only to Kyoto.  Canada participates in
<br>several U.S.-led multilateral initiatives, such as the Carbon
<br>Sequestration Leadership Forum and the International
<br>Partnership for the Hydrogen Economy.  We expect that they
<br>will soon join the Methane to Markets Partnership.
