<br>SUBJECT: 40TH JPMG: NEA REGIONAL DISCUSSION (PART 3 OF 4)
<br>
<br>Classified By: A/DCM Marc Sievers, reasons 1.4 (b),(d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) Summary: As part of the 40th Joint Political Military
<br>Group (JPMG), U.S. and GOI counterparts discussed security
<br>issues in the Near East region. GOI officials expressed
<br>support for the P5 plus 1 engagement process with Iran, but
<br>doubted the process would lead to any change in Iranian
<br>behavior -- Iran will use the engagement process as an
<br>opportunity to continue its pursuit of a nuclear weapon.
<br>Assistant Secretary for Political Military Affairs Andrew
<br>Shapiro stressed that engagement with Tehran was not "open
<br>ended"; the United States is preparing sanctions in the event
<br>engagement does not prove successful. GOI interlocutors
<br>continued to express concerns regarding U.S. support of the
<br>Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF); U.S. participants reiterated
<br>U.S. support of the LAF as a counterweight to Hizballah. A/S
<br>Shapiro noted NEA, with PM participation and support, plans
<br>to brief the GOI on the U.S. policy regarding Lebanon in the
<br>near future. In a continuation from the JPMG Executive
<br>Session, GOI interlocutors made the argument that U.S. arms
<br>transfers in the region could potentially arm future enemies
<br>of Israel. GOI officials expressed frustration over the
<br>Goldstone Report; U.S. officials advocated sharing lessons
<br>learned regarding confronting terrorists in
<br>civilian-populated areas. GOI officials noted improved
<br>counter-smuggling efforts from Egypt regarding arms transfers
<br>to Gaza via the Sinai. However, they argued that Egypt can
<br>and should do more to prevent the flow of arms. U.S.
<br>delegation members also briefed on U.S. policy in Iraq, and
<br>expressed concerns about the current situation in Yemen.
<br>This is the third of four cables (septels) reporting on the
<br>JPMG. End summary.

<br>Plenary
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) MOD Director General Pinchas Buchris began the
<br>plenary, stating this was "perhaps the most important JPMG to
<br>date." He pointed to the threat of a nuclear Iran, and
<br>expressed hope that U.S. leadership will find a way to stop
<br>Iran. Otherwise, a nuclear-armed Iran will "impact the
<br>stability of the world," Buchris said. A/S Shapiro described
<br>this 40th JPMG as a key forum and the primary mechanism in
<br>the political-military dialogue between the United States and
<br>Israel. He said the United States wants to "re-energize" the
<br>JPMG, with the goal to "bring back strategic elements" into
<br>the discussion. A/S Shapiro highlighted the importance of
<br>mutual understanding and transparent dialogue.
<br>
<br>Iran
<br>----
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) MOD Political-Military Director Amos Gilad presented a
<br>strategic overview. He began with Iran, reciting President
<br>Obama's statement made during a visit to Israel prior to
<br>becoming president that the United States would not tolerate
<br>a nuclear Iran. Gilad said Israel concurs, and described
<br>current dialogue with Iran as the "most sensitive stage" and
<br>Iran's "last chance." He said Iran remains determined to
<br>
<br>TEL AVIV 00002502 002 OF 004
<br>
<br>
<br>reach the "nuclear option," which he described as
<br>"intolerable." He quoted former President and Ahmadinejad
<br>opponent Rafsanjani as saying Iran "only needs one bomb for
<br>Israel," implying that Iran will continue to threaten Israel
<br>regardless of its leadership.
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) A/S Shapiro noted that the United States shares
<br>Israel's concerns that Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapons
<br>program. He said that the United States is beginning with
<br>engagement, but at the same time is preparing tougher
<br>measures should engagement fail. A/S Shapiro stressed that
<br>engagement was not "open ended" -- the United States needs to
<br>see concrete steps and tangible results from the P5 1 talks.
<br>He noted concerns over the Qom facility; if Iran does not
<br>respond to engagement, then the United States will move
<br>toward stronger steps such as sanctions. DASD Kahl
<br>reiterated that it is not our intention to allow Iran to "run
<br>out the clock," and noted that engagement also serves to
<br>build international consensus on sanctions. MFA Deputy
<br>Director for Strategic Affairs Alon Bar argued that the
<br>United States must present a clearer message to the Europeans
<br>on what is expected of them regarding sanctions.
<br>
<br>¶6. (S) A representative from Mossad said Tehran understands
<br>that by reacting positively to engagement, Iran can continue
<br>to "play for time" and avoid sanctions while pursuing its
<br>strategic objective to obtain a military nuclear capability.
<br>From Mossad's perspective, there is no reason to believe Iran
<br>will do anything but use negotiations to stall for time so
<br>that by 2010-2011, Iran will have the technological
<br>capability to build a nuclear weapon -- essentially reducing
<br>the question of weaponizing to a political decision. Mossad
<br>said Iran's main crisis is in the political sphere -- the
<br>current regime is weaker than prior to the elections, but
<br>does not face significant risk as its security apparatus
<br>remains loyal, while the opposition lacks a charismatic
<br>leader. The goal of the regime, therefore, is to calm down
<br>the domestic political environment -- Khamenei realizes the
<br>frustration demonstrated following the elections has not
<br>disappeared. BG Smith asked if Khamenei's death might change
<br>the political landscape; Mossad noted no information to
<br>suggest a change in Khamenei's health, while those
<br>surrounding him appear more loyal than ever.
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) Mossad believes Iran wants to become a regional
<br>hegemon, and is dictating its agenda by using Hamas and
<br>Hizballah as force multipliers. In that respect, Iran is
<br>very creative in finding ways to transfer weapons systems to
<br>its proxies. Mossad said Tehran also understands the effort
<br>to split Syria from Iran's influence, and is working hard to
<br>deepen its relationship with Syria as a result. DASD Kahl
<br>argued that Iran is weaker regionally today than in recent
<br>years. He noted progress in Iraq, the results of the recent
<br>Lebanese elections, and outreach to Syria as signs of a
<br>weaker Iran. DASD Kahl also noted increased U.S. credibility
<br>in the Muslim world, while the crackdown following the
<br>Iranian elections exposed the current regime as brutal to the
<br>region and in Europe.
<br>
<br>Hizballah/Lebanon/Syria
<br>-----------------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (S) Gilad addressed threats posed by "Hizballahstan" and
<br>"Hamastan," noting that Hizballah/Hamas-Syria-Iran
<br>cooperation has strengthened. He noted that rockets from
<br>Lebanon can now cover the entire territory of Israel, while
<br>ballistic missiles -- although not new -- remain Israel's
<br>most serious threat with adversaries having the capability to
<br>target Israeli citizens and major cities. IDF J5 Col Shimon
<br>Arad noted four main trends in Lebanon: 1) internal political
<br>deadlock since the elections; 2) Hizballah's growing military
<br>capabilities; 3) Lebanon as a volatile military arena; and 4)
<br>Lebanon's susceptibility to outside influences, including
<br>Syria, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. He recommended improved
<br>US.-Israel coordination, and called for an exchange of views.
<br>Arad also recommended creating Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF)
<br>deconfliction measures, demanding improved LAF performance,
<br>and exerting greater pressure on Syria and smuggling.
<br>Finally, he called for sanctions on the Iranian Republican
<br>Guard Corps (IRGC), trilateral meetings with the Lebanese and
<br>UNIFIL to deter Hizballah, and bolstering UNIFIL by extending
<br>Gen. Graziano's tour for an additional six months.
<br>
<br>¶9. (S) A/S Shapiro acknowledged the GOI's desire for
<br>specifics regarding U.S. policy on Lebanon, and hoped to
<br>invite GOI representatives to Washington in the near future
<br>for a full brief led by NEA, with PM participation and
<br>support. He cited the need to provide an alternative to
<br>Hizballah, which explains U.S. goals to strengthen the LAF as
<br>a counterweight. DASD Kahl argued that any LAF cooperation
<br>
<br>TEL AVIV 00002502 003 OF 004
<br>
<br>
<br>with Hizballah is pragmatic given the LAF's current weakness.
<br>He noted that U.S. assistance has been temporarily put on
<br>hold since there is still no Lebanese government. Kahl also
<br>argued that prospects for better relations with Damascus
<br>depend on Syrian desires for better relations with the United
<br>States and the return of the Golan Heights. Arad argued that
<br>more must be done to weaken radicals and cease smuggling.
<br>Gilad said the GOI cannot envision a government in Lebanon
<br>without Hizballah, and said the LAF will come to the defense
<br>of Hizballah if attacked by Israel -- thus, a strengthened
<br>LAF hurts Israel.
<br>
<br>QME
<br>---
<br>
<br>¶10. (S) Turning to U.S. regional arms transfers, Gilad
<br>suggested Qualitative Military Edge (QME) as a "codename" for
<br>potential threats against Israel. Israel currently enjoys
<br>peace with regimes in Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the
<br>United Arab Emirates -- but the future is uncertain, and each
<br>of these regimes faces the potential for change, he argued.
<br>U.S. weapons -- "the best in the world" -- level the playing
<br>field by reducing the need for training -- and could
<br>ultimately aid a future enemy of Israel, Gilad said. A/S
<br>Shapiro stressed the importance of transparency -- while
<br>there may be differences between Israel and the United States
<br>in terms of a regional assessment, the key is to ensure that
<br>there are no surprises, he said.
<br>
<br>Peace Process
<br>-------------
<br>
<br>¶11. (S) Gilad described the Middle East peace process as a
<br>"pillar" of Israeli security. He quoted PM Netanyahu and
<br>President Peres that Israel remains sincerely committed to
<br>peace. Gilad noted however, that the re-launching of
<br>negotiations is complicated by the split in Palestinian
<br>leadership. He said a weak and corrupt PA had lost Gaza
<br>despite Israeli warnings. Gilad said 2010 will prove pivotal
<br>with Palestinian elections looming and Egyptian mediation
<br>efforts to broker reconciliation between Hamas and the PA
<br>having failed. That said, he noted that Israeli-PA security
<br>and economic cooperation in the West Bank continues to
<br>improve as Jenin and Nablus flourish, and described
<br>Palestinian security forces as the "good guys." NEA/IPA
<br>Director Tom Goldberger said Special Envoy Sen. Mitchell
<br>continues his mission, and noted that Egyptian reconciliation
<br>efforts were meant to strengthen the PA, not weaken it.
<br>
<br>Goldstone Report
<br>----------------
<br>
<br>¶12. (S) Gilad addressed Israel's immediate neighbors within
<br>the context of the Goldstone Report. He said Israel has
<br>checked "all the details" of the report, and have concluded
<br>that the report's accusations are "baseless." Buchris said
<br>the report sets a bad precedent for countries trying to
<br>protect its citizens from terrorists; he noted 300,000 phone
<br>calls from the IDF to houses in Gaza ahead of strikes in the
<br>effort to prevent civilian casualties -- "no other country
<br>has taken such steps," Buchris argued. A/S Shapiro
<br>highlighted strong U.S. opposition to the report's referral
<br>to the UN Security Council, noting the report's biased
<br>mandate.
<br>
<br>¶13. (S) Gilad said Israel only entered Gaza after Hamas
<br>violated the ceasefire or "tahdiya," which many Israelis felt
<br>was "humiliating" and left Defense Minister Barak open to
<br>criticism. Gilad characterized Operation Cast Lead as a
<br>success that accounted for humanitarian issues; the IDF
<br>showed restraint in the operation because Israel did not want
<br>to re-occupy Gaza. DASD Kahl advocated sharing perspectives
<br>and lessons learned on strategic communication to more
<br>effectively confront terrorists in civilian-populated areas.
<br>NSC Director for Israel and Palestinian Affairs Prem Kumar
<br>noted continued UNSC interest in the Goldstone Report, and
<br>asked Israel to inform the United States on any additional
<br>efforts or investigations the GOI was taking to help deflect
<br>any further damage from the report.
<br>
<br>Egypt/Counter-Smuggling
<br>-----------------------
<br>
<br>¶14. (S) Gilad said Israel was frustrated by its Arab
<br>neighbors -- including specifically Egypt -- for supporting
<br>the Goldstone Report, which complicates the peace process.
<br>Israel continues to benefit from good security cooperation
<br>with Jordan, he said. Gilad argued that Egypt could stop
<br>smuggling into Gaza "completely," and questioned whether
<br>Egypt should be judged by its efforts or results. Gilad
<br>
<br>TEL AVIV 00002502 004 OF 004
<br>
<br>
<br>stressed the latter, and argued Egypt can do more on
<br>counter-smuggling. Finally, he noted Israeli concerns that
<br>Egypt continues to prepare for a potential future military
<br>confrontation with Israel, while no Egyptian military
<br>officers visit Israel.
<br>
<br>¶15. (S) A/S Shapiro outlined U.S. military assistance to
<br>strengthen Egyptian border security, counter-terrorism,
<br>peacekeeping and civil defense efforts. He said the United
<br>States is working with Egypt to improve regional security
<br>efforts, such as counter-smuggling. Regarding the Gulf
<br>States and Saudi Arabia, A/S Shapiro stressed efforts to
<br>improve energy security and counter-terrorism, while
<br>bolstering the capabilities of the Gulf Cooperation Council
<br>(GCC) in the face of the Iranian threat. Finally, he noted
<br>U.S. withdrawal from the Anatolian Eagle exercise following
<br>the Turkish decision to suspend the IDF's participation. A/S
<br>Shapiro said the United States has been delivering the
<br>message that Turkey must improve its relationship with
<br>Israel.
<br>
<br>¶16. (S) PM Counter-Piracy Coordinator Maggi briefed on the
<br>counter smuggling technical discussion meeting (septel). He
<br>cited the importance of working with Israel's neighbors --
<br>including especially Egypt and Turkey -- to prevent Iranian
<br>weapons from entering Gaza. Maggi said more pressure should
<br>be applied in the EU and UN to gain more latitude -- and
<br>possibly further action from the EU. He said tracking cash
<br>flows, and increasing prosecutions and incarcerations were
<br>important, with the ultimate goal of increasing cooperation
<br>and momentum. Goldberger said Egypt sees Hamas as a national
<br>security threat, and added that Egypt had closed 200 tunnels
<br>since the beginning of 2009.
<br>
<br>¶17. (S) Goldberger noted Egyptian domestic political
<br>sensitivities, and questioned whether more commercial and
<br>humanitarian goods could be allowed through the Gaza border
<br>crossings. Gilad strongly stated that there were no limits
<br>on commercial goods through the border crossings. Goldberger
<br>asked about construction materiel like cement; Gilad said the
<br>GOI would not allow Hamas to build bunkers -- goods such as
<br>cement or iron would not be allowed because of their military
<br>applications. He also argued that smuggling is a lucrative
<br>business for all involved, including the Egyptian government,
<br>and said the best way to stop the smuggling was to increase
<br>arrests and incarcerations. Goldberger mentioned U.S.
<br>economic and development assistance efforts in Sinai. He
<br>noted that most requests to third countries to deny arms
<br>transfer overflights are based on Israeli intelligence;
<br>additional information/intelligence from the GOI would ensure
<br>greater cooperation. Bar raised prosecuting shipping
<br>companies complicit in arms transfers to Gaza; A/S Shapiro
<br>said he would take that back to Washington for further
<br>consideration.
<br>
<br>Iraq/Yemen
<br>----------
<br>
<br>¶18. (S) On Iraq, DASD Kahl noted there are currently 125,000
<br>U.S. soldiers in Iraq, which will be reduced to 50,000
<br>soldiers by September 1, 2010 with complete U.S. troop
<br>withdrawal by the end of 2011. He noted the U.S. goal of
<br>establishing a long-term strategic relationship with a
<br>sovereign, stable, and self-reliant Iraq. A/S Shapiro and
<br>DASD Kahl briefed the GOI on U.S. efforts to assist the Iraqi
<br>military to complete its counterinsurgency force, transition
<br>the military to a force that can defend its borders, and
<br>align the Iraqi military more closely to the United States.
<br>
<br>¶19. (S) DASD Kahl pointed to the growing threat (al Qaida, al
<br>Houthi insurgency, and southern secessionists) in Yemen. He
<br>said the United States is attempting to prevent Yemen from
<br>heading toward an "Afghanistan-type scenario" with general
<br>lawlessness and increased ungoverned spaces. BG Smith noted
<br>that al Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) continues to
<br>fester in North and sub-Saharan Africa. He said Egypt is
<br>actively involved in countering AQIM with 3,800 soldiers in
<br>Sudan -- this should be encouraged and expanded.
<br>
<br>¶20. (U) A/S Shapiro has cleared on this cable.
