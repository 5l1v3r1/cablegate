<br>REF: TBILISI 1341
<br>
<br>Classified By: AMBASSADOR JOHN F. TEFFT FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D)
<br>
<br>¶1.  (C)  Begin Summary and Comment:  Multiple bases,
<br>airports, and Georgia's port of Poti were all bombed
<br>overnight by Russian aircraft, with bombing continuing in the
<br>daylight hours of August 9, with bombs hitting civilian
<br>targets in the Georgian city of Gori.  Reports of casualties
<br>continue to come in, most still unreliable and unverifiable,
<br>but it is clear that casualty numbers are growing.  There
<br>were reportedly dozens killed in Senaki and Poti.  The
<br>government of Georgia has not declared a state of emergency,
<br>but is limiting news being aired on TV and has evacuated some
<br>key government buildings in Tbilisi.  The bombing is causing
<br>widespread fear in the Georgian population.  In South
<br>Ossetia, OSCE confirms that artillery fire continued into the
<br>morning hours near Tskhinvali.  The MFA has released no new
<br>statements, and the Ministry of Reintegration has said the
<br>Abkhaz de-facto authorities have asked UNOMIG to immediately
<br>withdraw from Kodori.  This sitrep covers events that have
<br>transpired overnight on August 8-9 in Georgia (reftel).  End
<br>Summary and comment.
<br>
<br>¶2.  (C)  President Saakashvili told the Ambassador in a late
<br>morning phone call that the Russians are out to take over
<br>Georgia and install a new regime.  They will not stop at
<br>retaking South Ossetia, but will move on Tbilisi.  He fears
<br>the Russians will never agree to a ceasefire.  Saakashvili
<br>and the Georgian leadership now believe that this entire
<br>Russian military operation is all part of a grand design by
<br>Putin to take Georgia and change the regime.  Saakashvili
<br>said that the Russian forces are now attacking Tskhinvali and
<br>the Georgian forces are resisting.  We believe the Georgians
<br>are out of air defense supplies, which makes them vulnerable
<br>to Russian air attacks.  He also believes the Russians will
<br>soon attack and try to seize the upper Kodori valley.
<br>Ominously, the Abkhaz formally asked UNOMIG this morning to
<br>withdraw their detachment in the Upper Kodori.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C)  OSCE observers report that beginning at 0600 on
<br>August 9 Georgian artillery began shelling Tskhinvali and
<br>becoming heavy after 0900 to the Southwest of the city.  The
<br>JPFK commander reported that ten of his Russian peacekeepers
<br>were dead, and others were wounded.  OSCE observers said that
<br>Georgian aircraft were bombing the city at 1100 on August 8.
<br>According to OSCE, there has been no visible presence of
<br>Georgian forces in the city since 1500 on August 8 when they
<br>withdrew.  No accurate numbers of casualties are available
<br>and no international organizations such as Red Cross are
<br>present to assist with casualties.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Poloff called the MFA and was told that there are no
<br>new statements since August 8, but confirmed that the
<br>Government has not/not called a state of emergency.  The MFA
<br>website: www.mfa.gov.ge appears to have been hacked.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Deputy Minister of Reintegration Ruslan Abashidze told
<br>Poloff that the situation in South Ossetia is the same as
<br>August 8, with shelling coming from Java, but he believes
<br>Georgian forces control the nearby villages.  He said that
<br>Georgian forces are in control of Tskhinvali and are inside
<br>the city. Turning to the Abkhaz conflict he reported that the
<br>Abkhaz side has asked UNOMIG to withdraw immediately from
<br>Kodori (note: we have been unable to confirm request this
<br>with UNOMIG but such a move indicated intended hostilities).
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) UNOMIG observers reported that all was quiet in the
<br>Zugdidi  on the evening of August 8, aside from Abkhaz moving
<br>9 T-55 (1960,s Soviet era) tanks toward the cease-fire line.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Confirmed overnight (August 8-9) bombings include:
<br>
<br>-- Vaziani, again.  This former Soviet military base, which
<br>is usually home to 4th Brigade is being used as a
<br>mobilization site for reservists.  It lies only a few
<br>kilometers east of Tbilisi.  Buildings were reportedly hit
<br>this time.
<br>
<br>-- Senaki military base in west Georgia.  This base is home
<br>to the 2nd Brigade.  Unconfirmed reports indicate 20 killed
<br>there.
<br>
<br>-- The Port of Poti.  Georgia's deepest port outside of
<br>Ochamchire in Abkhazia.  Several "flat racks" where ships are
<br>loaded and unloaded were bombed, as was the nearby Coast
<br>Guard station.  Press reports indicate at least 15 people
<br>were killed.
<br>
<br>TBILISI 00001343  002 OF 002
<br>
<br>-- Kopinari Airport near Kutaisi.  This joint civilian and
<br>military airport was also bombed.  It is home to Su-25
<br>fighters and AN-2 Colt resupply aircraft.
<br>
<br>-- Marneuli Airbase, approximately 40 km south of Tbilisi,
<br>was bombed for the third time.
<br>
<br>-- The city of Gori.  Apparently, one attempt by Russian jets
<br>to bomb an artillery position near Gori missed.  A bomb
<br>landed in town destroying some stores and abandoned
<br>buildings.  No casualties were reported in this attack.
<br>Georgian radio later reported that Russian bombers attacked
<br>Gori early August 9, attempting to knock out the last bridge
<br>linking the road crossing Georgia from east to west as well
<br>as a communications tower.  President Saakashvili reported
<br>that at mid-day August 9, Russian planes had begun bombing
<br>housing blocks in Gori, with hundreds of casualties, calling
<br>this "pure terror."
<br>
<br>-- Upper Kodori was also bombed.  Details are sketchy.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Additional unconfirmed reports include:
<br>
<br>-- Sections of the railroad running from Poti toward Kutaisi
<br>may have been bombed.
<br>
<br>-- Dozens of police in Mestia (north west Georgia) have
<br>mobilized and are moving toward the Russian border.
<br>
<br>-- The Zugdidi road is open, and Georgian troops are moving
<br>north toward Kodori.
<br>
<br>¶9.  (C) On the economic front, the Government has been
<br>undertaking contingency planning in case of a prolonged
<br>conflict.  During an August 8 meeting with the Ambassador,
<br>Prime Minister Gurgenidze talked about his efforts to calm
<br>investors during the current crisis.  He noted that the
<br>economy had been remarkably calm.  There had been no change
<br>in the currency and the stock exchange was working normally.
<br>Georgia had not touched its Eurobond money, and natural gas
<br>and electricity supplies were in good shape.  The PM noted
<br>that the Georgians were considering contingencies, especially
<br>with regard to energy supplies, should the conflict continue.
<br>For example, one major power plant had already shifted over
<br>to natural gas from electricity and there are plans to import
<br>gas from Turkey.  The Georgians are also planning to stop
<br>exports of electricity to Russia and have made arrangements
<br>to purchase "off-peak" energy from Azerbaijan.  Although
<br>investors were nervous, the PM noted that there was no panic
<br>buying among the population.
