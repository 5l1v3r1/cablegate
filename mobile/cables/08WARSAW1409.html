<br>
<br>¶1. (S) SUMMARY: Like us, Poland seeks to draw key countries 
<br>on the eastern boundary of Europe, like Ukraine and Georgia, 
<br>towards Western institutions. An increasingly active regional 
<br>player, Poland has evolved since 1989 from aid-recipient to 
<br>donor, helping us to spur reforms in the region. Warsaw has 
<br>lead EU engagement with its eastern neighbors through the 
<br>joint Polish-Swedish Eastern Partnership proposal, which was 
<br>accelerated in the shadow of the Georgia crisis and is now 
<br>embedded in European Commission strategy. Yet growing 
<br>self-confidence and an historical distrust of Russia can 
<br>sometimes lead Poland to get too far out in front -- like 
<br>when the Poles transferred sensitive armaments to Georgia and 
<br>took a gamble by pushing through the sudden removal of most 
<br>EU sanctions against Belarus. Despite the occasional 
<br>overstepping, Poland's Eastern Policy is an excellent 
<br>complement to our own, and projects like the Eastern 
<br>Partnership merit our support. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>STRATEGY BEHIND EASTERN PARTNERSHIP 
<br>----------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) The Eastern Partnership -- a proposal championed by 
<br>Poland and Sweden to deepen EU relations with Ukraine, 
<br>Georgia, Moldova, Belarus, Armenia, and Azerbaijan -- 
<br>embraces the central goals of Poland's increasingly active 
<br>regional policy: 
<br>
<br>-- Counter Russia's influence in Eastern Europe (although 
<br>Russia is officially welcome to take part in the Partnership); 
<br>-- Energize EU engagement with eastern neighbors in the 
<br>face of enlargement fatigue; and 
<br>-- Entice former Soviet states to embrace Western 
<br>democratic and free-market principles by offering tangible 
<br>benefits -- particularly a free trade area and eventual 
<br>visa-free travel. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) The Eastern Partnership and other Polish policies in 
<br>the region aim to counter a resurgent Russia. Foreign 
<br>Minister Sikorski told U.S. officials the GoP used to think 
<br>Russia would be a danger in 10-15 years, but after the 
<br>Georgia crisis, it could be as little as 10-15 months. 
<br>Polish analysts tell us having a pro-Western buffer zone in 
<br>Ukraine and Belarus would keep Poland off the front line with 
<br>an increasingly assertive Russia. By offering former Soviet 
<br>republics the prospect of free trade and visa-free travel to 
<br>the EU, the Eastern Partnership can spur the reforms needed 
<br>for eventual EU membership and stem growing Russian 
<br>influence. MFA officials note that the holder of a Russian 
<br>passport in Georgia currently faces fewer travel restrictions 
<br>in Europe than a holder of a Georgian passport. On the 
<br>economic front, Polish officials believe a larger western 
<br>business presence in countries like Belarus and Ukraine will 
<br>provide an alternative to Russian state-controlled companies, 
<br>and EU good governance programs can fight the corruption that 
<br>facilitates Russian political and economic influence. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Convinced that the EU has greater leverage with Moscow 
<br>than do individual Member States, the Tusk Government has 
<br>shed the confrontational rhetoric of its predecessor and 
<br>sought to build coalitions among EU members. Foreign 
<br>Minister Sikorski developed the Eastern Partnership with 
<br>Swedish FM Bildt, and Polish and Swedish embassies in EU 
<br>capitals jointly lobbied other Member States to support the 
<br>package. EU colleagues in Warsaw praise the undertaking as a 
<br>real coming of age for Poland in the EU. Tusk has also 
<br>striven to improve relations with Germany, which the Polish 
<br>MFA hopes will bring more financial backing for the Eastern 
<br>Partnership. The Prime Minister struck a deal with Paris in 
<br>March 2008 to support French proposals on the EU's southern 
<br>dimension initiative in exchange for France's support for the 
<br>Partnership. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Poland itself has evolved from aid recipient to 
<br>assistance provider, bilaterally allocating PLN 26 million 
<br>(USD 8.7 million) to Belarus and PLN 16 million (USD 5.3 
<br>million) to Ukraine in 2008. The aid will enhance 
<br>independent broadcasting media, border cooperation, public 
<br>administration, and people-to-people contacts. Poland has 
<br>also committed 6 million euro (USD 7.8 million) to Georgia 
<br>for the period 2008-2010. Robert Tyszkiewicz, the Deputy 
<br>Chair of the Sejm's Foreign Relations Committee, described 
<br>Poland's assistance as "modest, but useful and credible, 
<br>because we struggled with many of the same post-Communist 
<br>challenges." MFA officials have called for a high-level 
<br>strategic dialogue between Washington and Brussels -- with 
<br>
<br>WARSAW 00001409 002 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>Polish participation -- on targeting assistance to eastern 
<br>neighbors. 
<br>
<br>STRENGTHENING THE NATIONAL SECURITY UMBRELLA 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S) To complement increased EU engagement, Warsaw seeks to 
<br>bolster the U.S. and NATO security stance in Eastern Europe. 
<br>Polish officials perceive Russia's invasion of Georgia in 
<br>August as a vindication of their warnings about Moscow,s 
<br>aggressive behavior. According to the "Sikorski Doctrine," 
<br>any further attempt by Russia to redraw borders by force or 
<br>subversion should be regarded by Europe as a threat to its 
<br>security, entailing a proportional response by the entire 
<br>Euro-Atlantic community. Poland has pushed hard for Ukraine 
<br>and Georgia's NATO accession, and called on NATO to make sure 
<br>it can make good on Article V guarantees. Sikorski has 
<br>complained that NATO has evolved into a political club with 
<br>no teeth and warned that Poland would not be able to ignore a 
<br>repetition of the Georgia scenario in Ukraine. He has also 
<br>told U.S. officials that, in light of Russian excesses in 
<br>Georgia, Poland's risky policy of arming the Georgians with 
<br>MANPADS proved the right thing to do despite USG objections 
<br>(Ref B). 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Poland's perennial concerns about the adequacy of its 
<br>Allies' security guarantees played a key role in the decision 
<br>to sign the Ballistic Missile Defense Agreement (BMDA) with 
<br>the U.S. The GoP wants US/NATO boots (and infrastructure) on 
<br>the ground so that the U.S. will feel obliged to defend 
<br>Poland's territorial sovereignty in the event of a conflict. 
<br>Immediately after Russia's invasion of Georgia, Tusk 
<br>emphasized Poland's sense of vulnerability when he asked 
<br>high-level U.S. officials, "Now do you see why we wanted the 
<br>Patriot missiles and further security guarantees (as 
<br>requested during the Missile Defense talks)?" 
<br>
<br>RUSH TO REDUCE MINSK SANCTIONS 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) The Polish government -- lead by Sikorski -- pushed 
<br>through the temporary repeal of almost all EU visa sanctions 
<br>against Belarusian President Lukashenka's regime, despite USG 
<br>calls for a more gradual easing of sanctions. Sikorski 
<br>publicly suggested the U.S. was engaging in double standards 
<br>because of our close relations with a "dictatorship in Saudi 
<br>Arabia, but not in Belarus." Both Sikorski and Tusk 
<br>acknowledge that the GoP risks being perceived as embracing a 
<br>dictator; but they argue that engaging Belarus is 
<br>particularly important after the Russian invasion of Georgia. 
<br>The Prime Minister and Foreign Minister told U.S. officials 
<br>in August that Poland is responding to Belarus' signals of 
<br>interest in dialogue, and, like the U.S., to the release of 
<br>political prisoners in Belarus. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Tusk and Sikorski see engagement with Belarusian 
<br>authorities as the lesser of two evils. In the Poles' view, 
<br>an isolated Belarus could become completely ensnared by 
<br>Russia, with or without Lukashenka in power. Russian 
<br>domination would jeopardize democratic transformation and -- 
<br>more importantly, in Warsaw's view -- would dash hopes that 
<br>Belarus could become a buffer state between Poland and 
<br>Russia. The GoP is betting that Lukashenka enjoys enough 
<br>power to resist the elimination of independent Belarusian 
<br>institutions and maintain his freedom of maneuver. MFA 
<br>officials tell us that in response to the lifting of EU visa 
<br>sanctions, Belarus has signaled Brussels that Minsk would 
<br>ease some media restrictions. 
<br>
<br>CHALLENGES AHEAD 
<br>---------------- 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) MFA officials understand Poland's eastern policies 
<br>could elicit a sharp Russian reaction, but they see a greater 
<br>danger in doing nothing since they believe a resurgent, 
<br>aggressive Russia is here to stay. Poland has sought to 
<br>mitigate the risk of a backlash by maintaining a cordial 
<br>dialogue with Moscow and pursuing a united US-EU front 
<br>vis-a-vis Russia on sensitive energy and security issues. 
<br>President Lech Kaczynski, the Prime Minister's top political 
<br>rival, takes a more confrontational approach to Russia; he 
<br>often visits Georgia and makes pronouncements there without 
<br>coordinating with the government. To a certain extent, 
<br>Kaczynski's lurching east takes pressure off the Tusk 
<br>Government to be tough in public with Russia, but the two 
<br>leaders' divergent approaches could also hamper their ability 
<br>to achieve the shared goal of extending European and 
<br>trans-Atlantic institutions eastward. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) The Eastern Partnership competes for EU financing 
<br>with other projects, particularly the Union's Southern 
<br>
<br>WARSAW 00001409 003 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>Initiative with Mediterranean countries. The European 
<br>Commission's Eastern Partnership proposal included a request 
<br>for 350 million euro in fresh funds for 2010-13, which was 
<br>much less than the 600 million euro sum originally proposed 
<br>by Poland and Sweden. In contrast to the Southern 
<br>Initiative, the Partnership lacks a high-level special 
<br>coordinator who can advocate on the program's behalf within 
<br>the EU bureaucracy. Polish MFA officials also point out that 
<br>the success of the program depends on identifying and 
<br>implementing credible projects. 
<br>
<br>HELPING THE EASTERN PARTNERSHIP SUCCEED 
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Poland can be a reliable ally as we looks for ways to 
<br>enhance western influence beyond NATO's eastern borders. 
<br>Russian President Medvedev's threat to deploy Iskander 
<br>missiles in Kaliningrad in response to the Missile Defense 
<br>program has redoubled Polish determination to work with the 
<br>U.S. and the EU to shore up its eastern neighbors as a 
<br>bulwark against Russian encroachment. It is also very much 
<br>in our interest to work closely with Warsaw, Brussels, and 
<br>the incoming Czech and Swedish EU presidencies to ensure the 
<br>Partnership's success in enhancing EU ties with its eastern 
<br>neighborhood.
