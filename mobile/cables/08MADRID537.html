<br>
<br>¶1. (U) Two months after suffering a second straight defeat at
<br>the hands of President Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero,
<br>opposition Partido Popular (PP) leader Mariano Rajoy finds
<br>himself in the midst of a crisis that threatens the future of
<br>his party leadership. In the days following the March 9
<br>general election, Rajoy announced that he would remain the PP
<br>leader--reminding Spanish citizens that Jose Maria Aznar lost
<br>two elections to Felipe Gonzalez before finally winning in
<br>1996--and received the public support of nearly every senior
<br>party official. Rajoy then took steps to soften the party's
<br>tone and remake it in his own image, in an attempt to dilute
<br>the influence of Aznar. To that end, he eased out
<br>Congressional spokesman Eduardo Zaplana and Secretary General
<br>Angel Acebes and announced he would be taking the party in a
<br>new direction.
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) The cracks in PP unity began to show on April 7, when
<br>Madrid Regional President (U.S. governor equivalent)
<br>Esperanza Aguirre refused to rule out a challenge to Rajoy at
<br>the upcoming party conference in June. The potential for a
<br>challenge to Rajoy's leadership was a major news story in
<br>Spain for the next several days, with some in the PP even
<br>discussing the feasibility of conducting a U.S.-style primary
<br>system to choose the party's next leader. Rajoy and his
<br>supporters tried to douse any speculation of a leadership
<br>change, but the crisis has not gone away. More wood was
<br>added to the fire on May 12 when the popular PP leader in the
<br>Basque Country, Maria San Gil, announced that she would not
<br>serve again on the committee drafting the party's political
<br>program because she no longer had confidence in Rajoy or his
<br>team. Immediately after this announcement, senior party
<br>officials including Aguirre, Acebes, Madrid Councilwoman (and
<br>wife of President Aznar) Ana Botella, and former Aznar
<br>Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja, expressed their support
<br>for San Gil's decision and called on Rajoy to reflect on the
<br>current turmoil within his party. For the first time since
<br>the March 9 elections, we are now hearing serious speculation
<br>that Rajoy may not be able to hold on to power.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) During the week of May 5 (in the middle of the
<br>controversy over the future of Rajoy's leadership but before
<br>the uproar caused by the San Gil announcement), the Charge
<br>d'Affaires held separate meetings with Gustavo de Aristegui,
<br>PP Congressional Spokesman for Foreign Affairs, and Jorge
<br>Moragas, PP Director of International Relations and a key
<br>Rajoy advisor. Aristegui was very critical of Rajoy's
<br>actions in the wake of the electoral loss, saying that he
<br>seemed to be blaming everyone but himself for the results.
<br>He said Rajoy's actions to force out Zaplana and Acebes and
<br>bring in a new team were akin to the captain of a ship, not
<br>only abandoning ship, but leaving his crew in the sinking
<br>vessel. Aristegui said that Rajoy's lack of loyalty to those
<br>who had been with him all along was not sitting well with
<br>other PP leaders. He opined that Rajoy needed to open up the
<br>June party conference and allow all interested officials to
<br>present their candidacy for PP leadership. He said that if
<br>Rajoy was able to defeat challengers in a fair and open
<br>process, his leadership would no longer be questioned.
<br>Aristegui said that Rajoy may be able to maintain control
<br>beyond the June convention, but opposition to his leadership
<br>would grow if the PP does poorly in the next rounds of
<br>Spanish regional elections in the Basque Country (currently
<br>scheduled for April 2009) and Galicia (June 2009). It should
<br>be noted that Aristegui perhaps feels personally betrayed
<br>since Rajoy has clearly demoted him in the party's foreign
<br>policy circles.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) As expected, Moragas was more upbeat in his comments
<br>to the Charge and, while acknowledging that there were
<br>currently concerns about Rajoy's leadership, predicted that
<br>the party would eventually fall back in line. He said that
<br>in the coming weeks Rajoy would attempt to remain above the
<br>fray and look towards the next four years in opposition by
<br>issuing position papers on topics such as the economy,
<br>security, and regional issues. He said that President
<br>Zapatero and his Socialist government were in for a very
<br>rocky way ahead with the economy continuing to tank and key
<br>issues in Catalonia and the Basque Country coming to a head.
<br>He said it is more vital than ever for the party to remain
<br>united and seize the moment when Zapatero stumbles. Moragas
<br>said that he and Rajoy developed a close working relationship
<br>during the campaign and that he is now one of Rajoy's closest
<br>advisors. He added however that he was not a "Rajoy guy,"
<br>but rather a loyal party member who responded when asked to
<br>serve.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Rajoy does not posses great charisma, and many were
<br>surprised when former President Aznar hand-picked him as his
<br>successor in 2003. Many more were surprised when Rajoy did
<br>not bow out five years later after a second straight
<br>electoral loss. We believe Rajoy owes his longevity as much
<br>as anything to the lack of a credible successor within his
<br>own party. Would-be challengers such as Esperanza Aguirre,
<br>Madrid Mayor Alberto Ruiz-Gallardon, or Valencia Regional
<br>President Francisco Camps all have their own drawbacks, and
<br>none enjoys the national stature of Rajoy (and both
<br>Ruiz-Gallardon and Camps appear to still be backing Rajoy).
<br>However, a groundswell of opposition may be building. Maria
<br>San Gil's public criticism of Rajoy's leadership was
<br>certainly noteworthy, but maybe more so is the number of
<br>senior PP leaders coming out of the woodwork to express
<br>solidarity with her, and to call on Rajoy to seriously
<br>respond to the current unease among the party faithful.
<br>Rajoy may hold onto power for the time being due to the lack
<br>of a viable alternative, but we agree that further losses in
<br>Spain's regional elections over the next two years will make
<br>it difficult for him to remain the PP's national candidate in
<br>¶2012. PP leaders have traditionally been members of Congress
<br>due to the visibility afforded and the need for the
<br>opposition leader to be able to confront the sitting
<br>president directly in weekly debates, but some credible
<br>voices are mentioning the name of former IMF director and
<br>past Spanish Vice President Rodrigo Rato (now in the private
<br>sector) as a possible candidate to lead the party into the
<br>future.
