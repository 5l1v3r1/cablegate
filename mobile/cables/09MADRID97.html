<br>
<br>Classified By: ADCM William H. Duncan for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Allegations and counter-allegations of a
<br>spying scandal within the center-right Popular Party (PP)
<br>highlight the party's rivalries. Reports surfaced on January
<br>19 that the PP-led Madrid regional government's (analogous to
<br>a U.S. state) minister of justice and internal affairs,
<br>Francisco Granados, created a spy ring - allegedly financed
<br>by public funds and managed from official offices - to keep
<br>tabs on rival politicians within the PP itself. Photographic
<br>evidence of the surveillance has been made public, so there
<br>is a growing acceptance that these individuals were indeed
<br>monitored, but it is unclear by whom and for what purpose.
<br>Granados denies all the charges. Madrid Regional President
<br>Esperanza Aguirre, who holds a post equivalent to a U.S.
<br>Governor and is a leading force at the national level in the
<br>conservative wing of the Popular Party, has not been
<br>implicated in the scandal. However, several targets of the
<br>alleged espionage, such as Madrid Deputy Mayor Manuel Cobo,
<br>are allied to City of Madrid Mayor Alberto Ruiz-Gallardon,
<br>who represents the PP,s moderate wing and is often
<br>identified as Aguirre's chief rival for eventual leadership
<br>of the party if current leader Mariano Rajoy steps down.
<br>Aguirre has counterattacked with allegations that it is the
<br>PP itself and Madrid,s City Hall that have been keeping
<br>secret files on PP officials. The allegations have surfaced
<br>as regional and European elections loom on the horizon and
<br>have damaged the PP's attempts to present a united front
<br>following a prolonged and divisive debate last year about
<br>Rajoy's leadership.
<br>
<br>//THE ALLEGATIONS//
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) Leading news daily El Pais (left of center) broke the
<br>story on January 19. Marcos Pena, a former police inspector
<br>who had been hired by Granados as a security consultant, told
<br>the newspaper that he and a team of former Civil Guards ran
<br>investigations on individuals and that he prepared
<br>confidential reports for Granados alone. Among the growing
<br>list of alleged targets were Madrid Deputy Mayor Manuel Cobo,
<br>Madrid Regional Government Vice President Ignacio Gonzalez,
<br>and Alfredo Prada, former Madrid Regional Government Minister
<br>of Justice. Pena reportedly created detailed dossiers on
<br>each of these figures after having monitored their activities
<br>at work, outside the office, and even on trips abroad. Upon
<br>further investigation, El Pais says it encountered espionage
<br>data within Granados' office that pre-dates Pena's employment
<br>there, but also has reported that a civil servants, union is
<br>attacking Granados, claims that his office did not engage in
<br>espionage by publicly alleging that those among them who
<br>refused to cooperate in actions they perceived "verged on the
<br>illegal" and were "harassed and ridiculed" by outside
<br>"security consultants" that Granados hired. Photographic
<br>evidence of the surveillance has been made public, so there
<br>is a growing acceptance that these individuals were indeed
<br>monitored, but it is unclear by whom and for what purpose.
<br>According to the media, initial reports showed that the
<br>espionage was directed against key rivals of Aguirre who
<br>would have been likely to side with Rajoy. The spying
<br>appeared to be primarily aimed at determining who was
<br>conniving within the PP in the capital at a time of great
<br>upheaval in the party. Granados denies all the charges and
<br>says his office operates within the law.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) It is unclear what Aguirre knew or when she knew it;
<br>she at first disputed the veracity of the allegations,
<br>defended her subordinates, and called for anyone with
<br>knowledge of the facts to make it known to the proper
<br>authorities. In the second week of the scandal, however, she
<br>has come out fighting. She claims that she is a victim of a
<br>smear campaign by PP headquarters, which she says is after
<br>her politically. Spanish media reports suggest that PP
<br>headquarters has its own 69-page report - whose scanned index
<br>has been published - on the assets, friends, family and
<br>public decisions of her deputy, Gonzalez. Aguirre also has
<br>made counter-allegations, declaring that in 2006 Gonzalez
<br>discussed with Rajoy the existence of "secret" PP files on
<br>Gonzalez and Granados, which prompted Rajoy to phone Aguirre
<br>about the issue, which Aguirre admits later amounted to
<br>nothing compromising. The PP's former treasurer, Alvaro
<br>Lapuerta also has come forward, telling the press he informed
<br>Rajoy in March 2008 of his suspicions that he was being
<br>followed. However, some press reports suggest it was
<br>Lapuerta who assembled the 2006 files on Gonzalez and
<br>Granados. Finally, Aguirre has alleged that it is City Hall,
<br>led by Mayor Ruiz-Gallardon, rather than the regional office
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000097 002 OF 002
<br>
<br>
<br>which employs a parapolice espionage unit.
<br>
<br>//THE POLITICAL BACKDROP - JOCKEYING FOR POWER WITHIN THE PP//
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Before the March 2008 general election, Aguirre
<br>maneuvered successfully to keep her arch-rival, Madrid Mayor
<br>Ruiz-Gallardon, off the PP,s congressional lists, and
<br>following the defeat of PP leader Mariano Rajoy in the
<br>general election, she tried to unseat Rajoy. She abandoned
<br>that attempt when it became clear she did not have sufficient
<br>support within the party. Media reports suggest the
<br>espionage began in March 2008, shortly after the general
<br>election (i.e., when Aguirre was mounting her coup against
<br>Rajoy). Regarding the spy scandal, Ruiz-Gallardon has said
<br>it appears that the regional government is employing an
<br>illegal para-police organization with espionage powers and
<br>has called for an investigation to clear up the matter.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Rajoy has promised an internal PP investigation of the
<br>spying incident and has asked two trusted PP deputies to lead
<br>the inquiry. Despite being a two-time loser in Presidential
<br>politics and unrest in his own party, Rajoy won re-election
<br>as party leader last year. He thereafter pushed aside a
<br>number of party figures associated with former President Jose
<br>Maria Aznar and moved new figures, several of them female,
<br>into prominent positions in the party. The next scheduled
<br>opportunity to challenge him for the leadership will be at
<br>the PP convention in 2011 (the next general election is
<br>expected in 2012). Despite his post-general election moves
<br>to solidify his leadership, grumbling within the party about
<br>Rajoy has not stopped. Many say he has failed to take
<br>sufficient advantage of Zapatero,s vulnerability on the weak
<br>economy. The Galician and Basque regional elections on March
<br>1 and the European parliamentary elections on June 7 could be
<br>key tests for Rajoy. In anticipation, Rajoy, has said
<br>publicly he will not interpret a PP loss in any of those
<br>elections as an indication of lack of public support him.
<br>
<br>//LOOKING AHEAD - INVESTIGATIONS LIKELY TO UNCOVER MORE
<br>DETAILS//
<br>
<br>¶6. (U) A slew of investigations have begun to attempt to
<br>uncover what really has been going on. In addition to the
<br>internal PP investigation mentioned above, Madrid Deputy
<br>Mayor Cobo filed a lawsuit on January 21 to get to the bottom
<br>of the scandal; public prosecutors began their inquiry the
<br>next day. Their first witness was the El Pais journalist who
<br>broke the story; the newspaper already has provided the files
<br>it has on the subject. Meanwhile, Investigating Judge Jose
<br>Sierra opened a case on January 26 to investigate the alleged
<br>espionage against Gonzalez while overseas, which Sierra has
<br>stated could be a violation of article 197 of the Penal Code
<br>and could result in a prison sentence of one to four years
<br>for anyone convicted of having carried out the surveillance.
<br>Granados is scheduled to appear in the Madrid regional
<br>Assembly on January 30 to clarify the facts.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) COMMENT: This spy scandal has erupted into a near
<br>free-for-all of allegations and counter-allegations of
<br>espionage, at least some of which appears to have been
<br>actually carried out, although by whom, on whose orders and
<br>for what purposes all remain to be revealed. It also remains
<br>unknown who is behind the constant source of leaks to the
<br>press on the issue. This scandal, which will no doubt drag
<br>on for a long time, could become a serious liability for
<br>Esperanza Aguirre, a hyper-ambitious politician who sees
<br>herself as a future President of the Spanish Government. To
<br>the extent that Aguirre is damaged, Ruiz-Gallardon,s star
<br>may rise. Ruiz-Gallardon generally gets high marks as Mayor
<br>of Madrid. He is charming, sharp-witted, and has a
<br>reputation for honesty. An unknown is his vote-getting
<br>ability outside Madrid. During the Ambassador's farewell
<br>call with the Spanish President on January 16, Zapatero
<br>opined that Ruiz-Gallardon was the only member of the PP who
<br>could become President of Spain. As for Rajoy, while he may
<br>enjoy Aguirre,s discomfort, the scandal could add to the
<br>impression that the PP under his leadership is more concerned
<br>with its internal rivalries than with the problems of
<br>ordinary Spaniards. The only clear winner at the moment
<br>would seem to be Zapatero and the PSOE who not only benefit
<br>from the spectacle of PP fratricide but probably welcome the
<br>distraction from all the economic bad news on their watch.
