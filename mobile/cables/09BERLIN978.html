<br>SUBJECT: GERMANY REASSURES THE BALTS TO INCREASE MANEUVER 
<br>ROOM WITH RUSSIA 
<br>
<br>REF: BERLIN 806 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Acting Political Minister Counselor Stan Otto for reason 
<br>s 1.4 (c) and (d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: Germany continues to regard proposed NATO 
<br>contingency planning to defend the Balts against possible 
<br>Russian aggression as counterproductive and unnecessary, but 
<br>it has gone out of its way in recent months to take other 
<br>measures to reassure the Balts that it takes their security 
<br>concerns seriously. Germany has again volunteered to head 
<br>the NATO Baltic Air Policing Mission, and Defense Minister 
<br>Jung made an unprecedented trip to all three countries in 
<br>early June. The German MFA and MOD hope these and other 
<br>measures will assuage Baltic fears sufficiently to allow 
<br>German initiatives in drawing Russia closer to NATO to go 
<br>forward. The MFA sees an opportunity to deepen security 
<br>cooperation, even on missile defense given increased Russian 
<br>concern regarding Iran. Overall, Germany recognizes that 
<br>working with Russia is difficult, but hopes that U.S. efforts 
<br>to improve relations along with increased NATO-Russian 
<br>cooperation will move Russia further along the path to 
<br>becoming a reliable international partner. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>REACHING OUT 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) While the MFA and MOD offices responsible for the 
<br>Baltic countries and NATO do not characterize it as such, 
<br>Germany appears to have undertaken a deliberate effort in 
<br>recent months to demonstrate to the Balts that it takes their 
<br>security concerns seriously. It has volunteered again to 
<br>head the NATO Baltic Air Policing Mission, beginning August 
<br>31, which involves the deployment of four fighter aircraft to 
<br>Lithuania. Everyone recognizes that the aircraft themselves 
<br>could do little against a Russian attack, but Germany hopes 
<br>the Balts see them as a symbol of German (and NATO) 
<br>commitment to Article 5. Given the extreme economic troubles 
<br>in the Balts, the German MOD expects this commitment to last 
<br>several more years, as the countries are unlikely to be able 
<br>to afford their own aircraft anytime soon. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Another indication of German efforts to build bridges 
<br>to the Balts was Defense Minister Jung's unprecedented trip 
<br>to all three countries in early June to discuss how to 
<br>increase security cooperation. During the four-day trip, 
<br>Jung not only met his counterparts, but with the presidents 
<br>of all three countries as well. For the most part, the visit 
<br>was about building upon an already robust relationship, which 
<br>has included German training and exchange programs for 
<br>hundreds of Baltic troops in recent years. 
<br>
<br>THE WORRIES AND HOPES 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Although MFA Head of Northern Europe Division Thomas 
<br>Terstegen argues that the Baltic states are less concerned 
<br>about Russian aggression than they were last fall in the 
<br>immediate aftermath of the war in Georgia, contacts recognize 
<br>that the fundamental apprehension regarding Russia will not 
<br>disappear soon. MFA Deputy Head of NATO Division Gunnar 
<br>Denecke wondered whether the July 16 open letter to the U.S. 
<br>signed by former Central and Eastern European leaders -- 
<br>along with Swedish Defense Minister Tolgfors July 3 comments 
<br>regarding the EU's Baltic Sea Strategy -- would cause the 
<br>Balts to become more suspicious of Russian intentions. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) The MFA considers the efforts of "some NATO partners, 
<br>like the Balts" to stall NATO-Russia Council (NRC) 
<br>cooperation as an impediment to U.S. efforts to improve 
<br>relations with Russia. Moreover, the Balts' demand for NATO 
<br>contingency planning against possible Russian aggression is 
<br>likely to worry Russia even more, according to the MOD. Even 
<br>though the Balts are proving troublesome in the NRC, the MFA 
<br>is equally frustrated by Russia's attempts to block 
<br>cooperation. The MFA believes the best move Russia could 
<br>take to improve NRC relations would be to remove (Russian 
<br>Permanent Representative) Rogozin from Brussels. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Despite these tensions, the MFA sees a window of 
<br>opportunity to improve security cooperation with Russia 
<br>because of growing Russian suspicion of Iran. Looking at the 
<br>recent G8 Summit statement and conversations from 
<br>German-Russian consultations in July, the MFA thinks Russia 
<br>may be willing to cooperate more with NATO vis-a-vis Iran, 
<br>perhaps even on missile defense (MD). Although the MFA 
<br>acknowledges that it would be a hard sell, they do not 
<br>consider it a lost cause. 
<br>
<br>COMMENT 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) The Germans are well-aware that their attempts to 
<br>accommodate and reach out to the Russians are viewed with 
<br>suspicion by many countries in eastern Europe. Defense 
<br>
<br>BERLIN 00000978 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>Minister Jung's trip to the Baltic countries, Germany's 
<br>participation in the NATO Baltic Air Policing Mission and 
<br>Steinmeier's joint visit to Ukraine with Polish FM Sikorski 
<br>(reftel) are all aimed at reassuring the Balts and other east 
<br>Europeans that Berlin takes their security concerns 
<br>seriously. The German calculation is that these efforts will 
<br>give them more freedom to draw Russia closer to NATO without 
<br>incurring automatic opposition from the new Allies. The 
<br>Germans are also hoping to forestall moves that they feel 
<br>would be counterproductive to the development of closer 
<br>NATO-Russia relations, particularly NATO contingency planning 
<br>oriented specifically against possible Russian aggression. 
<br>On MD, the Germans seem to be betting that in the end, we 
<br>will decide to pursue some kind of system to protect European 
<br>allies and forward-deployed U.S. forces against missile 
<br>threats. As a result, they are urging the Russians to keep 
<br>an open mind about MD so that this issue does not derail 
<br>overall NATO-Russia cooperation down the road. End Comment.
