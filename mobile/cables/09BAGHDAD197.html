<br>SUBJECT: RUBAIE CLAIMS HE CARRIED MESSAGE OF CONFIDENT IRAQ 
<br>IN VISIT TO IRAN 
<br>
<br>REF: BAGHDAD 91 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Minister-Counselor for Political-Military Affairs Michae 
<br>l Corbin for reasons 1.4 (b-d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) Summary: National Security Advisor Mowafaq al-Rubaie 
<br>carried the message of a more confident Iraq to Tehran in 
<br>meetings with senior Iranian officials January 19-22, 
<br>according to a readout of the visit Rubaie gave to Ambassador 
<br>Satterfield, PMIN and Pol-Mil Counselor after returning to 
<br>Baghdad. Rubaie said his Iranian interlocutors did not react 
<br>harshly to the USG-GOI Security Agreement signed in December, 
<br>while he characterized to them the problems of drug 
<br>trafficking and other border issues as a threat to Iraq. He 
<br>denied telling the Iranian press that the GoI would close the 
<br>Mujahedin-e Khalq's Camp Ashraf in two months. He said he 
<br>responded to Iranian questions about the "Erbil 3" by saying 
<br>that after MNF-I turns these detainees over to GoI custody, 
<br>the GOI would determine whether they face Iraqi judicial 
<br>charges and release them if not. Rubaie said he believed the 
<br>Iranians were ready to make overtures to the new U.S. 
<br>administration and were waiting for the right "signs" to 
<br>respond. Separately, Rubaie outlined his goals for the visit 
<br>in a note to Ambassador Crocker, saying that he wanted to 
<br>demonstrate Iraq is not a proxy for anyone. End summary. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) In a meeting with Ambassador Satterfield, PMIN and 
<br>Pol-Mil Couns, NSA Rubaie said that during his January 19-22 
<br>visit to Tehran he met with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, 
<br>Foreign Minister Manuchehr Motaki, Parliament Speaker Ali 
<br>Larijani, and Saeed Jalili, secretary of the Supreme National 
<br>Security Council. In addition, when pressed by Ambassador 
<br>Satterfield, Rubaie said that Qasem Soleimani, head of the 
<br>Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Qods Force, had "stopped 
<br>by" for a "very short meeting" on January 22 before Rubaie 
<br>saw Ahmadinejad. Rubaie said he believed the Iranians were 
<br>ready to make overtures to the new U.S. administration and 
<br>were waiting for the right "signs" to respond. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) Rubaie said the focus of his presentations to the 
<br>Iranian officials was on Iraq's new status as a country more 
<br>"confident" due to the reduction in violence. He said he had 
<br>not heard a harsh reaction to the GOI decision to sign the 
<br>U.S.-Iraq security agreement, instead the Iranians "were 
<br>impressed" by what the GOI had obtained from the U.S. through 
<br>effective bargaining. In response to a question from 
<br>Ambassador Satterfield, Rubaie said the subject of a 
<br>referendum on the security agreement had "not been raised at 
<br>all" by the Iranians. Rubaie said he had told them that the 
<br>GOI intended to monitor the implementation of the security 
<br>agreement over the next six months to see if it met GOI 
<br>expectations. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) On other issues, he said he focused on the dangers of 
<br>drug trafficking and border problems from Iran, describing 
<br>these issues as a threat to Iraq. Regarding the Mujahedin-e 
<br>Khalq (MeK), Rubaie said he had reiterated the GOI's position 
<br>that the MeK should leave Iraq, but would not be forcibly 
<br>expelled. He claimed he had not stated as reported in 
<br>Iranian press that the MeK's Camp Ashraf would be closed in 
<br>two months. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) Rubaie said the Iranians had raised the issue of the 
<br>"Erbil 3" -- IRGC officers detained by MNF-I in 2007 who 
<br>claimed to be in Iraq as diplomats -- and asked when they 
<br>would be released. Rubaie said he had responded that when 
<br>MNF-I handed them over to the GOI, the GOI would determine 
<br>whether they faced any Iraqi judicial charges. If not, they 
<br>Qwhether they faced any Iraqi judicial charges. If not, they 
<br>would be released. Ambassador Satterfield asked if the 
<br>Iranians had raised their longstanding request for 
<br>accreditation of two "diplomats" (know to the GoI and US to 
<br>be IRGC officers) to Iranian consulates in Irbil and 
<br>Sulaimaniyah. Rubaie said the subject did not come up. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S) In terms of atmospherics, Rubaie said all of his 
<br>interlocutors had been speaking from the same set of talking 
<br>points. They had all also had a binder of press clippings of 
<br>statements by Rubaie critical of Iran going back over the 
<br>past three years. Rubaie had responded that these statements 
<br>were reactions to Iran's continual squeezing of Iraq. In an 
<br>elaborate metaphor, he said he had told the Iranians that 
<br>there is an Arab proverb that when one steps on someone's 
<br>stomach, the victim involuntarily protests by exhaling. 
<br>Soleimani had responded that "Iran is the mother of all Shia 
<br>in the world" and had quoted back a Koranic proverb that "no 
<br>matter what one's parents do, a child should never criticize 
<br>them."

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶7. (S/NF) Separately, Rubaie outlined his goals for the 
<br>visit in a note to Ambassador Crocker. He said that he 
<br>wanted to demonstrate Iraq will not be a proxy for anyone, 
<br>build a cooperative relationship with Iran, explain GoI MeK 
<br>policy, express the advantages to Iran of a stable Iraq, and 
<br>explain the advantages to Iraq and its neighbors of the 
<br>"Withdrawal Agreement." Among his planned talking points were 
<br>concerns about the discovery of Iranian-made weapons and 
<br>ammunition used against Iraqis and Americans, while noting 
<br>that "the rate of this has been much lower in recent weeks 
<br>than in the past." (NOTE: Shortly before Rubaie departed for 
<br>Iran, MNF-I intelligence officers briefed him about recently 
<br>discovered Iranian munitions in Iraq that were apparently 
<br>manufactured as recently as 2008.) 
<br>
<br>¶8. (S) Comment: In contrast to Rubaie's tough-talking 
<br>descriptions of the Tehran meetings, press accounts portrayed 
<br>the visit as a warm affirmation of Iraqi-Iranian relations. 
<br>Both depictions are self-serving; the truth is likely 
<br>somewhere in the middle. But Rubaie's description of Iranian 
<br>acquiescence to the Security Agreement is consistent with 
<br>reports of PM Maliki's visit to Tehran this month (reftel) 
<br>and other indications that the Iranians are treating visiting 
<br>Iraqi officials with increasing degrees of respect. The 
<br>Iranians haven't publicly objected to the Security Agreement 
<br>and may be hopeful that we are going to withdraw relatively 
<br>quickly.
