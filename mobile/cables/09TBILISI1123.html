<br>SUBJECT: IMPORTANCE OF CONTINUED MILITARY ENGAGEMENT WITH
<br>GEORGIA
<br>
<br>REF: MOSCOW 1591
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador John F. Tefft for Reasons 1.4(b) and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary. The June 22 kickoff of the U.S.-Georgia
<br>Charter Commission will raise the question of the future of
<br>our military cooperation. Embassy Moscow's recent cable
<br>(reftel) has highlighted Russian views and the potential
<br>impact on our attempt to reset our relations with Moscow.
<br>There are, however, strong arguments in favor of providing
<br>Georgia a modest, transparent defensive capability. We
<br>provide our views in this cable. In our assessment, the
<br>Russians are effectively using propaganda based in falsehoods
<br>regarding the current state of the Georgian military to
<br>ratchet up tensions, while simultaneously impressing upon the
<br>U.S. that any efforts to provide military assistance to
<br>Georgia will pose potential roadblocks to improving the
<br>U.S.-Russia relationship. Accepting Russian objections,
<br>however, contradicts stated U.S. policies such as rejecting
<br>the notion of spheres of influence; refusing a third party
<br>veto over NATO membership; and maintaining equal commitment
<br>to relations with both Russia and Georgia. It gives Russian
<br>disinformation an undeserved voice in U.S. policy formation.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Summary, continued: Embassy Tbilisi believes that
<br>increased transparent military cooperation could help
<br>stabilize the situation in Georgia, as Georgia seeks to
<br>develop its defensive capacity -- and even decrease the size
<br>of its standing army. Retreating from our commitments would
<br>send a profoundly mixed signal to our partners in the region
<br>and in western Europe, especially to those who are
<br>considering opening up their society, increasing
<br>transparency, and seeking increased partnership with the
<br>west. Russia will undoubtedly object to increased military
<br>cooperation, but the answer is not to validate their concern,
<br>but to set the record straight in an organized, aggressive
<br>private and public diplomacy campaign with both Russia and
<br>our broader partners. To do otherwise would be to reward
<br>Russia's aggression in Georgia, as well as its violation of
<br>international law and commitments; encourage a similar stance
<br>in Ukraine; and deal a body blow to our credibility in
<br>Georgia, other Eurasian states, our western partners -- and
<br>ultimately Russia itself. End summary.
<br>
<br>THE GEORGIAN ARMY HAS NOT RE-ARMED
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Russian claims that Georgia has more military
<br>capability now than in August 2008,or that it has been
<br>steadily re-arming its forces, are false. During the August
<br>2008 conflict, Georgia lost extensive capabilities, including
<br>30 percent of its armored vehicles, 40 percent of
<br>U.S.-produced AR-15 rifles, and at least 60 percent of its
<br>air defense capability. These have not been replaced. We
<br>are aware of only two deliveries of lethal military equipment
<br>since the war: Ejder armored personnel carriers from a
<br>Turkish firm, based on a pre-war contract; and 16 armored
<br>HMMWVs for the Special Forces Brigade under a program begun
<br>in 2007. The latter were purchased using Coalition Support
<br>Funds, the case was processed before the August war, and the
<br>vehicles would be used in such coalition operations as those
<br>in Afghanistan. The U.S. and other NATO partners have moved
<br>cautiously since the war. Bilateral military-to-military
<br>events between NATO partners and Georgia have been reduced,
<br>Qevents between NATO partners and Georgia have been reduced,
<br>suspended, even terminated. The U.S. in particular has yet
<br>to renew a capacity-building program begun months ago, and we
<br>have not executed a single kinetic event since August,
<br>despite Georgian desires for more tactical training. The
<br>NATO PfP Lancer/Longbow exercises, publicly used by Russia
<br>against the Alliance and Georgia, were planned more than a
<br>year in advance with full Russian knowledge and possibility
<br>for participation.
<br>
<br>JOINING THE AFGHANISTAN COALITION
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Secretary Gates' approach on security cooperation of
<br>"brains before brawn" (B3) focuses on the intellectual
<br>development of the Georgian armed forces and is non-kinetic
<br>in nature. The U.S. has now told Georgia we accepted their
<br>offer to deploy a battalion for two years in RC-South, one of
<br>the most dangerous areas of Afghanistan. While it is not yet
<br>known how much training and equipping will be needed to bring
<br>Georgia effectively into the coalition, it is in both U.S.
<br>and Russian interests to widen the coalition in Afghanistan.
<br>Some lethal training will undoubtedly be involved, and we
<br>should not allow Russia to twist any such cooperation in
<br>
<br>TBILISI 00001123 002 OF 004
<br>
<br>
<br>Afghanistan, one of the Administration's top priorities, into
<br>a phantom threat.
<br>
<br>MINIMAL DEFENSIVE CAPABILITIES NEEDED FOR SURVIVAL
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Georgia also wants to rebuild its native defensive
<br>capacity, which is currently insufficient to control its own
<br>airspace or hinder an invasion from any of its neighbors.
<br>Current Georgian operational thinking is that if they can
<br>defend Tbilisi from occupation for 72 hours, then
<br>international pressure will force the advance to pause. To
<br>achieve this extremely limited goal, Georgia needs sufficient
<br>anti-armor and air defense capability to stall a ground
<br>advance, which it currently lacks. The development of this
<br>capacity is not solely equipment-based, but it will require
<br>the acquisition of new lethal defensive systems. If Georgia
<br>does not procure the equipment from the U.S., it will almost
<br>surely seek to procure it elsewhere, as it has done in the
<br>past. U.S. involvement would help ensure the transparency of
<br>the procurement process itself, as well as increase our
<br>control over the amount, type and location of the equipment.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) In addition, Minister Sikharulidze recently approved
<br>an intermediate force structure change that would reduce the
<br>Georgian Armed Forces total personnel strength by 6,000
<br>service members from the current 36,000. (Current actual
<br>personnel is approximately 31,000.) Without prejudging the
<br>ongoing Strategic Assessment process, the Minister has
<br>confided to us that the final Georgian force structure will
<br>be below 30,000. The Georgians have not publicized this
<br>proposed downsizing because they fear that a smaller Georgian
<br>Army could encourage Russian armed incursions. Furthermore,
<br>a recently proposed further 7 percent reduction in the
<br>defense budget will drop Georgia's total defense spending to
<br>less than half of 2008 levels.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Georgia's military plan is defensive in nature. As
<br>EUR Assistant Secretary Gordon recently noted to Georgian
<br>Defense Minister Sikharulidze, every country has the right to
<br>defend itself - as described in Article 51 of the UN Charter.
<br>Russia may argue no weapon is only defensive in nature;
<br>anti-tank and air defense systems, however, would not give
<br>Georgia the capacity to launch an offensive attack. Russia
<br>may argue that Georgia is acquiring other, more offensive
<br>systems clandestinely at the same time. There is no evidence
<br>to support this assertion, and we would have a much greater
<br>degree of influence -- and be in a position to keep Russia
<br>well informed -- if we were involved in defensive system
<br>procurement. Finally, Russia will likely level allegations
<br>of increased Georgian offensive capacity regardless of facts,
<br>just as they have done in the Geneva process. Georgia,
<br>however, provides far more transparency on its military
<br>forces than virtually any country in the world, signing MOUs
<br>between the EU Monitoring Mission (EUMM) and its Ministries
<br>of Defense and Internal Affairs that give the observers
<br>unprecedented access to Georgian military and law enforcement
<br>installations. The EUMM, along with the OSCE, has repeatedly
<br>affirmed that Georgia has respected the limits established in
<br>those MOUs and has no offensive capability near Abkhazia and
<br>South Ossetia. Russia essentially ignores these statements
<br>and continues to level the same allegations, but that bluster
<br>Qand continues to level the same allegations, but that bluster
<br>does not change the fact of Georgia's continued restraint.
<br>As we seek to help Georgia develop its defensive capacity, we
<br>could pursue smilar public and/or written commitments from
<br>the Georgians on the exclusively defensive nature of the
<br>program.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) We believe that providing Georgia with enhanced
<br>defensive capabilities will stabilize the situation. While
<br>Russia, as well as the de facto regimes in Abkhazia and South
<br>Ossetia, may argue otherwise, it is Russia and its proxy
<br>regimes that have dramatically increased the militarization
<br>of Georgia over the past year. Russia has introduced at
<br>least 3,700 troops into sovereign Georgian territory, as well
<br>as heavy military equipment, such as tanks, artillery and
<br>anti-aircraft systems, into the area immediately adjacent to
<br>the administrative boundaries -- in direct violation of the
<br>commitments President Medvedev made in the cease-fire
<br>agreement. It is Georgia that has lost 14 police officers
<br>since the war; kidnappings, cattle thefts, and detentions
<br>continue along the boundary, mostly on the Abkhaz and South
<br>Ossetian sides. Russian helicopters make regular flights
<br>along the boundaries, sometimes crossing them, and Russian
<br>forces move large numbers of troops and heavy equipment along
<br>the boundaries at will. Meanwhile, the EUMM, OSCE and UNOMIG
<br>
<br>TBILISI 00001123 003 OF 004
<br>
<br>
<br>continue to confirm Georgia's cooperative and constructive
<br>approach. There is little to deter Russia from taking
<br>additional military action, except a legitimate defensive
<br>force opposing it. At the same time, such a force would not
<br>pose an offensive threat to the regions.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Retreating from military cooperation would be a step
<br>back from commitments we have made to Georgia and other
<br>international partners. Not only will Georgia be
<br>disappointed in our diminished support, and hesitant to trust
<br>us again, but other partners will draw the same conclusions.
<br>The Russia-Georgia war has already led some countries, such
<br>as Azerbaijan and the Central Asian states, to question the
<br>extent of our commitment, even though we never committed to
<br>the direct military defense of Georgia. A step back from
<br>commitments we have made would remove any doubt in our
<br>unreliability and convince countries from Belarus to
<br>Kyrgyzstan, even as they try to recalibrate their own
<br>relationship with Russia, that the risks of continuing
<br>partnership with Russia are less than those of moving toward
<br>cooperation with the United States. One of our specific
<br>commitments has been to NATO membership for Georgia,
<br>politically at the Bucharest Summit, and at the operational
<br>level, with the Georgia-NATO Commission and the Annual
<br>National Plan. A key component of that process is the
<br>development of Georgia's homeland defense capacity. Since
<br>last August we have engaged with Georgia on elements of their
<br>preparation for Euro-Atlantic integration, but the military
<br>component cannot be deferred indefinitely. The longer we
<br>defer action, the clearer the message will be to Georgia and
<br>others that our commitment to membership has diminished.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Beyond our specific commitment to Georgia, we have
<br>made broader commitments not to allow Russia to impose its
<br>flawed zero-sum vision on our own strategic view of the
<br>world. The Secretary explicitly rejected Russia's notion of
<br>spheres of influence during her May 7 meeting with Foreign
<br>Minister Lavrov. The Vice President rejected the same notion
<br>at the February Munich Security Conference. The President
<br>himself told President Medvedev the same thing in London.
<br>All three have likewise expressed unequivocal support for
<br>Georgia's NATO aspirations and territorial integrity. Any
<br>perceived or real retreat from these unambiguous statements
<br>-- and our special relationship with Georgia makes it a test
<br>case -- will raise questions about our leadership.
<br>
<br>LOOKING AHEAD
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) A difficult, but crucial, element of our strategy for
<br>continuing engagement with Georgia while maintaining a good
<br>relationship with Russia will be an aggressive private, as
<br>well as public diplomacy campaign that is well coordinated
<br>with our western partners. Russia will try to spin any
<br>military cooperation as negatively as possible, but we must
<br>not allow Russian disinformation to go unchallenged. As
<br>noted above, we have already taken the first step in our
<br>engagement with the Georgian military: agreeing together on
<br>the B3 approach. We are currently exploring the best fit for
<br>a Georgian contribution to the effort in Afghanistan.
<br>Neither of these areas could be considered threatening. A
<br>further step, toward helping Georgia improve its defensive
<br>capacity, would not be inherently threatening, and could help
<br>Qcapacity, would not be inherently threatening, and could help
<br>stabilize the situation. We must resist efforts to cast it
<br>any other way. Russia will likely continue to portray NATO
<br>engagement as threatening.
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) More fundamentally, Russia continues to characterize
<br>our differing agendas in the post-Soviet space as a zero-sum,
<br>new "Great Game". Unlike in the 19th century, when two
<br>empires vied to establish control over the intervening
<br>territory in the exclusive pursuit of their own narrow
<br>interests, U.S. policy seeks to enable independent countries
<br>to make their own choices. However real the perception may
<br>be among Russians that the United States is out to get them,
<br>we must resist all efforts to confuse that perception with
<br>our true intentions. Georgia is seeking to choose its own
<br>partners, defend its own country, establish a market-based
<br>economy free of corruption, and further develop its young
<br>democracy -- and we are helping it do so. Georgia poses no
<br>threat to Russia; it wants the political space to pursue its
<br>own path. To step back from our mission because Russia
<br>mitrusts our motives is to cede to Russia the terms of
<br>development in Eurasia for the foreseeable future.
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) There are two practical steps that we might consider
<br>
<br>TBILISI 00001123 004 OF 004
<br>
<br>
<br>pursuing to help both address the real danger of instability
<br>and blunt Russia's momentum in the public diplomacy sphere.
<br>First, we could encourage Georgia to make public and/or
<br>written commitments about the exclusively defensive nature of
<br>its new military programs. Second, we could encourage
<br>Georgia to offer to sign a non-use of force agreement with
<br>Russia. Russia has been pushing hard for such an agreement
<br>between Georgia and its own regions, which Georgia has
<br>understandably been unwilling to consider. If Georgia were
<br>to call Russia's bluff and offer to sign such an agreement
<br>with Russia itself, however, the burden would shift to Russia
<br>to demonstrate the sincerity of its commitment to stability.
<br>It is unlikely that Russia, which still maintains the fiction
<br>that it is not a party to the conflict, would accept
<br>Georgia's offer, but it would be left on the defensive.
<br>Meanwhile Georgia could pursue its defensive development with
<br>a ready answer to any Russian claims of belligerence or
<br>provocation. (Note: Embassy Tbilisi has not explored either
<br>of these steps with Georgia, so they are only ideas at this
<br>point, but experience suggests Georgia would at least be
<br>willing to consider them. The steps Georgia has already
<br>taken to provide transparency on its military and law
<br>enforcement activities suggest they would be willing to take
<br>similar steps. In the months after the war, senior Georgian
<br>officials expressed their willingness to pursue a non-use of
<br>force agreement if Russia made certain concessions. End
<br>note.)
<br>
<br>COMMENT: BALANCING RISKS
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) Embassy Tbilisi does not question the importance or
<br>difficulty of managing our relationship with Russia,
<br>especially if we proceed with further military cooperation
<br>with Georgia. No matter how loudly we insist on the true
<br>state of affairs, most Russians at this point will either not
<br>believe us or ignore us, as Embassy Moscow pointed out.
<br>There is indeed a risk that taking the next step with Georgia
<br>will jeopardize the improvement of our relationship with
<br>Russia. There is also a risk, however, that not taking that
<br>step will both foster further instability in Georgia and
<br>jeopardize our credibility in a much broader space.
<br>Furthermore, as past experience has shown, there is yet
<br>another risk: that improvements in relations with Russia,
<br>even if bought with compromises on other U.S. interests, will
<br>not pay off with any real dividends. Embassy Tbilisi would
<br>argue that sacrificing a relationship with a dedicated
<br>partner like Georgia is the greater risk, because it will
<br>only embolden Russia in the future, both to push for more
<br>concessions on our part and to reassert its perceived sphere
<br>of influence further. Up to this point, Russia has paid no
<br>concrete penalty whatsoever for invading and occupying a
<br>neighboring country; unilaterally recognizing two of its
<br>regions as independent states; violating CFE and cease-fire
<br>commitments by vastly increasing its military presence in
<br>those regions and not allowing humanitarian access;
<br>corrupting the original concept of the Geneva process into a
<br>forum to lend legitimacy to the regions; blocking a
<br>status-neutral effort by the international community, through
<br>the OSCE, to promote stability; and killing the UN Observer
<br>Mission in Georgia. Allowing Russia to dictate the pace of
<br>QMission in Georgia. Allowing Russia to dictate the pace of
<br>military engagement with Georgia will be seen as rewarding
<br>Russia for its behavior. It could only be a matter of time
<br>before it takes similar actions in Ukraine or elsewhere.
