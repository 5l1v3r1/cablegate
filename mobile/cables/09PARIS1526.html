<br>
<br>Classified By: Classified By: Kathleen Allegrone, Minister Counselor, r 
<br>eason 1.4, b and d. 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: Considered "a love fest" by the MFA, the 
<br>growing Franco-Brazilian relationship under Presidents 
<br>Sarkozy and Lula is likely to result in more political, 
<br>diplomatic, economic, and military engagement in the next 
<br>three years and throughout Sarkozy's time in office. 
<br>Committed to expanding France's role as a global player, 
<br>Sarkozy is preparing for the French G-8 and G-20 presidency 
<br>in 2011 with a foreign policy of reaching out to emerging 
<br>powers in an effort to promote France's international clout. 
<br>His direct involvement in the not yet concluded Rafale 
<br>fighter jet sale to Brazil highlights his use of his personal 
<br>ties with Lula to persistently court the regional giant and 
<br>will serve as a model of French entree into Latin America and 
<br>beyond. In Paris on November 14, Lula and Sarkozy met to 
<br>address climate change issues which included an announcement 
<br>that Sarkozy will travel to Latin America next week which we 
<br>view as a continuation of the French President,s charm 
<br>offensive. Septels will address economic and environmental 
<br>aspects of this bilateral relationship. Post welcomes 
<br>Embassy Brasilia's comments on this assessment. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>MOBILIZING THE EMERGING POWERS 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br>¶2. (C) Highly encouraged by the growing importance of the 
<br>G-20 precipitated by the economic crisis, President Nicholas 
<br>Sarkozy is recalibrating his policies by increasingly 
<br>courting populous, non-aligned states in the hopes of 
<br>extending French international influence. Ahead of assuming 
<br>both the G-8 and G-20 presidency in 2011, Sarkozy has been 
<br>wooing what he calls "countries which are bridgeheads," or 
<br>states with which France has traditionally not had a close 
<br>relationship, and forming a body of allies that will help the 
<br>GOF refashion its image as a key leader in a multi-polar 
<br>world. (See septel on economic and G-20 issues.) 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) In his August 26 annual address to French diplomats, 
<br>Sarkozy declared that the G-8 should be expanded to include 
<br>Brazil, China, India, Mexico, South Africa, and Egypt to form 
<br>the G-14, or what he has dubbed with Lula as the &Alliance 
<br>for Change,8 promising to implement the change during the 
<br>French G-8 presidency. Even before becoming President, he 
<br>has demonstrated a policy of actively pursuing the potential 
<br>six new members of the G-14 formation, starting with Brazil. 
<br>Employing multi-billion dollar military and civilian trade 
<br>deals as his calling card, Sarkozy has successfully managed 
<br>to forge extremely close ties with Brazil in the past two 
<br>years, picking up from where his predecessor Chirac left off 
<br>in a previous attempt to woo the world,s fifth most populous 
<br>nation of 200 million. 
<br>
<br>LIKE "LOOKING IN THE MIRROR" 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>¶4. (C) Having first met in 2007, Brazilian embassy contacts 
<br>in Paris described the initial bilateral meeting as the 
<br>"start of the love affair" where Sarkozy and Luiz Inacio Lula 
<br>da Silva discovered that they shared "a vision of a new 
<br>multilateralism" in global governance and the view of Brazil 
<br>as a vast market and regional platform for France. Sarkozy 
<br>has often remarked that the two agree on a "near totality of 
<br>issues," including economic recovery, climate change, and 
<br>security. Brazilian diplomats noted that the two men have 
<br>very similar personalities and that Lula has often commented 
<br>that looking at Sarkozy is like "looking in the mirror." The 
<br>two leaders have put an emphasis on their warm personal 
<br>chemistry and France's status as the only EU country sharing 
<br>a border with Brazil, with French Guiana located just north 
<br>of South America's largest country. The "unique" bilateral 
<br>partnership and close friendship between the energetic 
<br>Sarkozy and the charismatic and popular Lula is of particular 
<br>note given that the Brazilian president does not speak 
<br>English or French and the relationship is conducted almost 
<br>exclusively through interpreters. Nonetheless, Brazilian 
<br>diplomats based in Paris commented that the two men speak "a 
<br>distinct common language" motivated by their drive to reshape 
<br>the world order. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Explaining that Chirac was responsible for starting 
<br>the strategic relationship with Brazil based on the two 
<br>countries' long history of common values, MFA Assistant 
<br>Secretary for the Americas Elisabeth Beton-Delegue echoed the 
<br>Brazilians on October 7, calling the friendship between 
<br>Sarkozy and Lula a real "love story" and noted that Brazil 
<br>represents one of France's diplomatic and commercial 
<br>priorities in the Americas under the current French 
<br>President. Sarkozy met with Lula four times in 2008 and has 
<br>already held four bilateral meetings with his Brazilian 
<br>counterpart in 2009. First Lady Carla Bruni did not 
<br>participate in the French President's most recent trip to 
<br>Brasilia to the disappointment of the Brazilian public, who 
<br>reportedly greatly appreciate the fact that France's first 
<br>couple often vacation in their country, according to the 
<br>Brazilian embassy in Paris. Comment: We judge that Sarkozy 
<br>takes full advantage of Carla Bruni,s individual popularity 
<br>and their popularity as a couple to advance French national 
<br>interests in Brazil. 
<br>
<br>FRANCO-BRAZILIAN BILATERAL RELATIONS 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br>¶6. (C) The close relationship between Sarkozy and Lula grew 
<br>from solid foundations. As France's leading trade partner in 
<br>Latin America, Brazil hosts over 420 French companies which 
<br>employ approximately 400,000 people. French exports totaled 
<br>over $5 billion and Brazilian exports to France over $6 
<br>billion in 2008. The Brazilians have a well established 
<br>military relationship with the French that dates back to the 
<br>mid-1980s, most recently including a $12 billion arms and 
<br>technology transfer deal passed by the Brazilian Senate on 
<br>September 3, in which France will help Brasilia establish 
<br>their nascent nuclear submarine program, according to 
<br>Brazilian Embassy sources in Paris. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) In addition, Brazil is France's leading regional 
<br>partner for cultural, scientific, and technical cooperation. 
<br>Three French secondary schools in Sao Paolo, Rio de Janeiro, 
<br>and Brasilia have a total of 2,200 students, half of which 
<br>are French nationals. Considered the most culturally 
<br>influential foreign country by our Brazilian diplomatic 
<br>contacts, the Alliance Francaise in Brazil constitutes the 
<br>oldest and most extensive in the world, with 74 
<br>establishments in 52 towns. Brazil is currently celebrating 
<br>the "Year of France," with a series of cultural and 
<br>cooperative events in commerce and technology to reciprocate 
<br>the "Year of Brazil" in France in 2005. Their embassy in 
<br>Paris noted that Brazil is currently engaging in tri-lateral 
<br>cooperation with the French on agricultural projects in a 
<br>host of African countries (Cameroon, Mozambique, Uganda) and 
<br>are interested in developing their foreign policy initiatives 
<br>in the region, as they have a large Afro-Brazilian 
<br>population. Further illustrating the strength of the 
<br>existing Franco-Brazilian ties, Paris mayor Bertrand Delanoe 
<br>was made an "honorary citizen" of the city of Rio de Janeiro 
<br>on October 27 by his counterpart mayor, Eduardor Paes, after 
<br>the two men signed an agreement focused on the revitalization 
<br>and renovation of Rio's port areas. Both countries also 
<br>shared recent grief over the loss of 228 people onboard Air 
<br>France Flight 447 in June, when the Airbus A330 disappeared 
<br>over the Atlantic Ocean during a Rio de Janeiro-Paris flight. 
<br>Over 500 relatives of the victims and 40 members of Air 
<br>France held a memorial service on November 7 in Rio, with 
<br>junior French minister Alain Joyandet, in charge of overseas 
<br>cooperation, representing the GOF. 
<br>
<br>THE "F-X2" PROJECT 
<br>------------------ 
<br>¶8. (C) Paris used the positive political climate to try to 
<br>position the Rafale as the winner in the competition to equip 
<br>the Brazilian Air Force with new fighter aircraft, in the 
<br>hopes of edging out the American F/A-18 Super Hornet and the 
<br>Swedish Grippen. Politically motivated, the Brazilian Foreign 
<br>Ministry decision to publicly announce their intention to go 
<br>with French company Dassault, which makes the Rafale, over 
<br>the Brazilian Air Force's preferred Super Hornet stemmed from 
<br>Lula's close relationship with Sarkozy. Although the deal 
<br>known as "F-X2" or the fleet expansion is still unsettled, 
<br>the French President did much to persuade his Brazilian 
<br>counterpart to lean toward the French-made fighter jets in 
<br>his two-day trip to Brasilia, where he dined with Lula and 
<br>was the special guest at Brazil's September 7 Independence 
<br>Day celebrations, which featured French Foreign Legion troops 
<br>and an over-flight of French planes. In so doing, he 
<br>attempted to demonstrate that his political ties with Lula 
<br>are ultimately reinforced by industrial deals. Sarkozy 
<br>presented the myth that France is the perfect partner for 
<br>states that do not want to rely on U.S. technology, even 
<br>though the U.S. has agreed in principle to transfer relevant 
<br>technology if Brazil purchases the F-18. However, if the 
<br>Rafale sale goes through, Dassault may have to request 
<br>export-control licenses from the U.S. for parts built with 
<br>American technology. Although the F-X2 decision has yet to 
<br>be confirmed by Brazil, the GOF appears confident that it has 
<br>beaten out the American and Swedish competition thanks to 
<br>Sarkozy's diplomatic efforts. Moreover, Brazilian poloff 
<br>Bruno de Lacerda Carrilho in Paris revealed on October 8 that 
<br>Brasilia has been particularly receptive to such personal 
<br>engagement at the Presidential level by France, posing the 
<br>question of whether Obama would become personally involved. 
<br>Marking his fifth visit to Brazil this year, Sarkozy is 
<br>scheduled to travel to Manaus on November 26 for the Summit 
<br>of Amazon countries and is expected to advance his broad 
<br>political and commercial objectives with Brazil. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Leveraging his personal rapport with Lula to advance 
<br>the bilateral relationship, Sarkozy depicted the union as "a 
<br>balanced partnership with two legs, one civilian and the 
<br>other military. The military has progressed faster but the 
<br>civilian will eventually win out." The two leaders have 
<br>already signed off on the $12 billion purchase of five 
<br>submarines, four conventional and Latin America's first 
<br>nuclear-propelled submarine, to be built in a new shipyard at 
<br>Itaguai, as well as 50 military transport helicopters that 
<br>will be assembled in Minas Gerais. (Comment: The 
<br>conventional submarines incorporate U.S.-origin GE Marine 
<br>engines.) At the same time, Brazil announced its intention 
<br>to begin negotiations to purchase the 36 Rafale fighter jets 
<br>which could increase the financial transaction to $20 
<br>billion if the deal officially goes through. The French have 
<br>from the start guaranteed to give the Brazilians Rafale 
<br>software source codes that represent the very digital heart 
<br>of the aircraft, a step we understand the others bidders were 
<br>reluctant at first to take. After Lula complained to Sarkozy 
<br>about the "absurd price" of the Rafales at $80 million each, 
<br>MFA sources state that the French president sent him a 
<br>personal letter stressing French willingness to participate 
<br>in the "unrestricted transfer" of technological intelligence" 
<br>that the Brazilian Defense Minister Nelson Jobim had made 
<br>known was a prerequisite for major arms deals in April. 
<br>Labeled the "French comparative advantage," the technology 
<br>transfer appealed to Brazil's desire to not only purchase the 
<br>Rafale but to manufacture the aircraft in-country and 
<br>possibly sell them throughout Latin America by 2030, stated 
<br>the Brazilian pol-mil attache Marcus Rector Toledo Silva in 
<br>Paris to poloff on September 11. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) According to Brazilian pol-mil attache Silva, the 
<br>fighter jet saga was spurred by the release of the Brazilian 
<br>National Defense Strategy in December 2008. He noted that 
<br>the Brazilian Air Force has 110 jets dating from the 1970s 
<br>and 1980s that are too old and outdated for a country whose 
<br>needs include patrolling 5 million square miles of territory, 
<br>10.5 million miles of national border, and vast offshore oil 
<br>platforms. Brazil's most modern aircraft are 12 French 
<br>Mirage 2000s, purchased second-hand and approaching their 
<br>retirement dates. By contrast, neighbors Chile and Venezuela 
<br>have 29 F-16s and 24 Sukhoi 30s respectively, both 
<br>representing the most advanced models available. With Hugo 
<br>Chavez recently buying over $3 billion in aircraft, tanks, 
<br>and assault weapons from Russia, Brazil also seeks to enhance 
<br>its regional military capabilities. Thus the deal brokered 
<br>by Sarkozy was key for Dassault, bilateral defense ties, and 
<br>boosting civilian sector trade over the long term. In the 
<br>middle of all the media uproar however, two Rafale jets fell 
<br>into the Mediterranean, provoking much discussion in the 
<br>French and Brazilian press about the fact that the jets had 
<br>never been sold outside of France. The crash also raised 
<br>questions about why the Rafale's trade deal during the 
<br>Moroccan fighter competition in 2008 fell through. 
<br>
<br>FRENCH CONTRIBUTION TO CREATING A MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---------------- 
<br>¶11. (C) As Lula has repeatedly stated, Brazil has ambitions 
<br>of becoming a world power in the coming decades and believes 
<br>the key is through the acquisition of certain technological 
<br>and military autonomy. MFA contacts claim that unlike the 
<br>U.S. relationship, France is ready to address Brazil's trade 
<br>and technological development needs. Consequently, the 
<br>recently signed bilateral agreements symbolize more than the 
<br>purchase of armaments, commented Brazilian poloff de Lacerdo 
<br>Carrilho. Rather, he stated that they denote the creation of 
<br>the largest military industrial complex in the southern 
<br>hemisphere for the emerging industrial superpower, home to 
<br>the seventh largest oil reserves in the world and the largest 
<br>area of natural biodiversity in the Amazon. In the last two 
<br>years, Brazil has announced the discovery of huge offshore 
<br>oil reserves called Pre-salt in ultra-deep waters in the 
<br>Atlantic that could finance its rise to first world status, 
<br>according to Lula. The country also has vast natural 
<br>resources in timber, gold, and uranium in the Amazon, 
<br>allegedly being exploited illegally by groups said to include 
<br>the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). Brazil 
<br>seeks to protect its riches and assert itself as a new 
<br>military power and France is "ready to fully support Brazil 
<br>as an emerging power," said MFA Assistant Secretary for the 
<br>Americas Beton-Delegue to poloffs on October 7. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Under Sarkozy, France has become a consistent 
<br>champion of all Brazilian aspirations, backing efforts for 
<br>Brazil's ascent to a permanent seat on the UNSC, a 
<br>long-standing Brazilian ambition. France also voted for and 
<br>strongly supported Rio de Janeiro to host the 2016 Olympics 
<br>in early September and was one of the first countries to 
<br>congratulate Brazil on its victory. MFA Brazil desk officer 
<br>told poloff that as usual, Sarkozy had the foresight to 
<br>develop good relations with Brazil, which is set to showcase 
<br>two of the world's greatest sporting events with the 2014 
<br>World Cup final scheduled to be played in Rio. Embassy 
<br>Brazil contacts in Paris believe that the Franco-Brazilian 
<br>relationship is only getting started and envision an 
<br>expansion of the civilian cooperation to possibly include 
<br>industrial contracts for aerospace and transportation in the 
<br>upcoming months, once the Rafale deal is concluded. Hinting 
<br>at rumors that Brazil could buy as many as 100 French-made 
<br>fighter jets, Brazilian poloff de Lacerdo Carrilho suggested 
<br>that there is much more to come of the bilateral 
<br>relationship, whether the F-X2 deal goes through or not. 
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) COMMENT: The deepening partnership with Brasilia 
<br>provides France with greater entre into Latin America. A 
<br>strategically symbiotic relationship, French interest in 
<br>Brazil seems to benefit both countries. Lula's decision to 
<br>back the purchase of French fighter jets indicates the 
<br>deepening Franco-Brazilian relationship and demonstrates the 
<br>increasing political, diplomatic, and specifically commercial 
<br>success of Sarkozy's courtship. Sarkozy is expected to shift 
<br>into diplomatic overdrive in 2011 to boost his 2012 
<br>re-election campaign and can point to his foreign policy 
<br>triumph with Brazil as an indication of his prowess. As the 
<br>Brazilians continue to hold bidders in suspense over their 
<br>fleet renovation project due to be finalized by the end of 
<br>the year, look for Sarkozy to reappear in the southern 
<br>hemisphere with his familiar calling card of military and 
<br>civilian contracts. Post welcomes Embassy Brasilia's 
<br>perspectives on this Paris-based assessment of the growing 
<br>Franco-Brazilian relationship.
