<br>
<br>REF: A. ANKARA 3 
<br>¶B. ANKARA 126 
<br>
<br>Classified By: EUR/PRA Dir. Anita Friedt, 
<br>Reason 1.4 (b), (c) and (d) 
<br>
<br>---------- 
<br>BACKGROUND 
<br>----------- 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S//NF) Venezuelan officials expected to receive a 
<br>shipment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and related 
<br>material from Iran, via Turkey, by May 2009. As of early 
<br>March, Venezuelan officials believed that the equipment would 
<br>be repackaged and labeled as electronic equipment, then 
<br>transported overland from Iran to Turkey. Once in Turkey, 
<br>the equipment would be loaded onto a maritime vessel for 
<br>continued shipment to Venezuela. The U.S. believes this 
<br>shipment constitutes arms and related materiel, which Iran is 
<br>prohibited from transferring pursuant to UN Security Council 
<br>Resolution 1747, paragraph 5. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) This case appears to be similar to one from January 
<br>2009 where Iran attempted to ship drums of nitrate and 
<br>sulphite chemicals and dismantled laboratory instruments, 
<br>which could possibly be used for making bombs to Venezuela 
<br>via Turkey. In response to U.S. concerns that the shipment 
<br>may have been a violation of UNSCR 1747, Turkish officials 
<br>inspected the cargo and made a decision to return it to Iran. 
<br>(REFS A and B) 
<br>
<br>-------------- 
<br>ACTION REQUEST 
<br>-------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) Drawing from the points in paragraph 5, which may be 
<br>left as a nonpaper, post is instructed to approach 
<br>appropriate-level Turkish officials and request that they 
<br>investigate this activity, and if the cargo is found to be in 
<br>violation of UNSCR 1747 that the GOT use all available means 
<br>to prevent the transshipment of this cargo and detain it. 
<br>
<br>---------- 
<br>OBJECTIVES 
<br>---------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) Post should seek to achieve the following: 
<br>-- Provide Turkish officials with information regarding 
<br>Iran,s attempt to ship unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and 
<br>related material to Venezuela via Turkey; 
<br>
<br>-- Emphasize to the Turkish officials that UN Security 
<br>Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1747, paragraph 5, prohibits Iran 
<br>from transferring any arms or related materiel; 
<br>
<br>-- Emphasize that these goods are produced by an Iranian 
<br>entity listed in the Annex to UNSCR 1747. 
<br>
<br>-- Urge the Government of Turkey (GOT) to take action against 
<br>this shipment pursuant to UNSCR 1747 and possibly 1737, and 
<br>in accordance with the GOT's laws and authorities; 
<br>
<br>-- Thank the GOT for its willingness to interdict and take 
<br>positive action with regards to a similar shipment in 
<br>January. As a NATO Ally, we try to provide Turkey with as 
<br>much info as possible on these issues, which could help lead 
<br>them to take action in detaining shipments; and 
<br>-- Emphasized that, should we receive additional information 
<br>regarding this shipment, we will provide it as expeditiously 
<br>as possible. 
<br>
<br>------------------------ 
<br>TALKING POINTS/NON-PAPER 
<br>------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S//REL Turkey) Begin talking points/non-paper: 
<br>
<br>--We would like to share some information with you in an 
<br>effort to highlight a transfer of proliferation concern and 
<br>to ensure that Iran does not make use of your territory to 
<br>transfer items proscribed by UN Security Council resolutions 
<br>1737, 1747, and 1803. 
<br>
<br>-- The U.S. has information indicating that Venezuelan 
<br>officials expected to receive a shipment of UAV and 
<br>UAV-related equipment from Iran by May 2009. 
<br>
<br>-- As of early March, Venezuelan officials believed that the 
<br>equipment would be repackaged and labeled as electronic 
<br>equipment, then transported overland from Iran to Turkey. 
<br>Once in Turkey, the equipment would be loaded onto a maritime 
<br>vessel for continued shipment to Venezuela. 
<br>
<br>--Venezuelan officials assessed that a shipment of 
<br>electronics coming from Turkey to Venezuela would be less 
<br>alerting than a shipment directly from Iran. 
<br>
<br>--We believe these items are military UAVs and related items, 
<br>constituting arms and related materials and are thus captured 
<br>by UNSCR 1747 and subject to the asset freeze called for in 
<br>UNSCR 1737. 
<br>
<br>-- UN Security Council Resolution 1747, paragraph 5, 
<br>prohibits Iran from supplying, selling or transferring any 
<br>arms or related materiel. It also requires all states to 
<br>prohibit the procurement of such items from Iran by their 
<br>nationals, or using their flag vessels or aircraft, and 
<br>whether or not such transfers originated in the territory of 
<br>Iran. 
<br>
<br>--This system is produced by the Qods Aviation Industries. 
<br>
<br>-- Qods Aeronautics Industries (aka Qods Aviations 
<br>Industries) is designated in the Annex to UNSCR 1747 and as 
<br>such these items would be subject to the asset freeze 
<br>provision of UNSCR 1737 regardless of whether the item is 
<br>MTCR- controlled or otherwise prohibited in paragraphs 3 or 4 
<br>of the resolution. 
<br>
<br>-- As such, we request your assistance in preventing the 
<br>transfer of goods in violation of UNSCR 1747 and 1737. 
<br>
<br>-- Additionally, it is possible that some UAV-related 
<br>equipment may be MTCR-controlled, per MTCR Item 12.A.1., if 
<br>the equipment is designed or modified to support other 
<br>Iranian UAVs that meet the Item 1.A.2. or 19.A.2. criteria. 
<br>Such items are included in document S/2006/815, the list of 
<br>items, materials, equipment, goods and technology related to 
<br>ballistic missile programs. Transfer of these items would be 
<br>a violation of UNSCR 1737 per paragraph 3. 
<br>
<br>-- We deeply appreciate the Government of Turkey's continued 
<br>cooperation, support and willingness to enact prompt and 
<br>thorough efforts in promoting interdictions designed to 
<br>prevent the transfer of sensitive materials by Iran.
