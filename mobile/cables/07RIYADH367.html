<br>SUBJECT: APHSCT TOWNSEND FEBRUARY 6 MEETING WITH FOREIGN
<br>MINISTER PRINCE SAUD AL-FAISAL
<br>
<br>REF: 06 RIYADH 9083
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador James C. Oberwetter
<br>for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1.  (S) SUMMARY: Assistant to the President for Homeland
<br>Security and Counterterrorism Francis Fragos Townsend covered
<br>both counterterrorism cooperation and regional political
<br>issues in her meeting with Foreign Minister Prince Saud
<br>Al-Faisal at his home in Jeddah on February 6.  Saud
<br>described the February 2 arrests of ten suspected terrorism
<br>financiers in Jeddah and Medina as a positive step that could
<br>well result in other leads and arrests.  On the proposed
<br>Charities Commission, Saud said that the SAG is leaning
<br>toward establishing a government entity that directly
<br>disburses charitable funds.  He characterized engagement with
<br>Iran as a two-pronged approach involving frank dialogue and
<br>security pressure.  "We will supply the logic and you supply
<br>the pressure," he said, adding that the US Navy's recent
<br>strengthening of presence in the Gulf was a good example of
<br>the force element.  In response to APHSCT Townsend's request
<br>to use SAG influence with Arabsat to block Al-Manar
<br>broadcasting, Prince Saud replied that Iranian-financed
<br>cultural centers in Lebanon, Iraq and Afghanistan are a
<br>greater source of Iranian influence in the region than
<br>Al-Manar television.  On Arab-Israeli issues, Prince Saud
<br>hoped Secretary Rice would return to the region soon to
<br>address the "key substantive issues" of Jerusalem and
<br>Palestinian refugees.  In a subsequent private meeting,
<br>APHSCT Townsend renewed US concerns about the Saudi
<br>Ambassador in the Philippines; Saud said that the ambassador
<br>would be ending his tour shortly. END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>¶2.  (S)  APHSCT Townsend commended Prince Saud on efforts to
<br>counter terrorist financing but urged more progress. She
<br>noted that the President was quite concerned about bilateral
<br>cooperation in this area and that she had a letter for King
<br>Abdullah from the President on this subject.  Prince Saud
<br>replied that the arrests of ten terror financing suspects on
<br>February 2 was "good progress" but that "more needs to be
<br>done."  Questioning these suspects could lead to more leads
<br>and arrests, he noted.  APHSCT Townsend said she had just met
<br>with Finance Minister al-Assaf to ask about the royal decree
<br>on declaring cash upon exit and entry.  The King had issued
<br>the decree over one year ago but it has yet to be
<br>implemented. Prince Saud noted that the Customs people are
<br>not the most capable, and that he was surprised at the lack
<br>of implementation.
<br>
<br>¶3.  (S) Asked by Prince Saud what the Ministry of Foreign
<br>Affairs could do to help on counterterrorism cooperation,
<br>APHSCT Townsend raised establishment of the Charities
<br>Commission, which was announced two years ago but not yet
<br>implemented. She noted that it could be set up in either of
<br>two ways: as a government body which is responsible for
<br>disbursing charitable donations; or as a regulatory body to
<br>oversee acts of the private charities, which is the way the
<br>US does it.  She stressed that a decision, either way, is
<br>needed.   Saud said the SAG was leaning towards an
<br>organization that has direct responsibility for disbursing
<br>charitable funds.   He noted there are Islamic law
<br>implications, implying that these implications are slowing
<br>down the decision process but are important to consider
<br>carefully.  APHSCT Townsend raised the issue of continuing
<br>activity by remnants of the UN-sanctioned al-Haramain
<br>organization.  Saud responded that any proposed illegal
<br>transfers are being monitored and stopped.  By following the
<br>trail of illegal transfers, the SAG has found and stopped the
<br>source of funding in many investigations-- sending a strong
<br>preventative message to others engaging in similar, illegal
<br>activities.  APHSCT Townsend thanked Prince Saud for the
<br>SAG's efforts in this area
<br>
<br>¶4.  (C) Asked by APHSCT Townsend about his views of
<br>developments in Iran, Prince Saud described the recent
<br>Iranian message, brought by Larijani, offering to help
<br>prevent a Sunni/Shi'ite sectarian divide.  Saud said his
<br>government is focused on Iranian actions, not words.  The
<br>Saudis had earlier warned the Iranians against pursuing a
<br>"dangerous" policy of sectarian division, especially in Iraq.
<br>He said Iran was embarking on a dangerous path of "fitna"
<br>(dissention) within the Muslim community.  Although there is
<br>a Shi'ite majority in Iraq, elsewhere in the region the Shi'a
<br>are a minority.  A sectarian-based policy in Iraq could
<br>jeopardize the situation of these Shi'ite minorities outside
<br>

<br>
<br>Iraq, he noted.
<br>
<br>¶5.  (C) Saud compared the Iranian influence in Iraq with
<br>Iranian influence in Lebanon, commenting that he saw
<br>positive signs in Lebanon, where Iran urged Hizbollah to stop
<br>street protests and go back to their homes.   Saud said that
<br>it is SAG policy to pursue very frank discussions with the
<br>Iranians; we need a joint policy of frankness and security
<br>pressure, he stressed.  Strengthening the US Navy presence in
<br>the Gulf sent a good message.  "You provide the pressure and
<br>we'll provide the logic," he said.
<br>
<br>¶6.  (C) APHSCT Townsend said that Hizbollah does not appear
<br>to the US to have toned down its rhetoric, and she raised the
<br>request for Saudi help with Arabsat to block the broadcast of
<br>al-Manar television.  Blocking al-Manar would help reduce
<br>Hizbollah's sphere of influence, she said.  The French have
<br>agreed not to permit the broadcast of al-Manar, she noted.
<br>Prince Saud replied that the "more important problem" is the
<br>Hizbollah cultural center, which exercises greater influence
<br>than al-Manar television and could be closed down by  the
<br>multi-national forces, he asserted.  The Iranians also fund
<br>such centers in Afghanistan and Iraq, he said.
<br>
<br>¶7.  C)  Ambassador Oberwetter asked Prince Saud about media
<br>reports ahead of Russian President Putin's visit to Saudi
<br>Arabia on February 11-12 regarding a Russian interest in
<br>discussing a "Middle East Security Regime."  Prince Saud said
<br>that he was unaware of such a plan, and that the scheduled
<br>visit will focus on bilateral relations, including military
<br>cooperation and economic agreements.  He noted that the
<br>Saudis will raise the possible purchase of military equipment
<br>from the Russians because "your people told us it would be
<br>better purchased from Russia, because they are cheaper and
<br>just as good."  He said he did not know why the US had told
<br>the Kingdom to go to the Russians, but that they would
<br>nonetheless.  He added that the Saudis will raise UN Security
<br>Council issues, especially the tribunal to look into the
<br>Hariri assassination, and the Quartet issues.
<br>
<br>¶8.  (S) On Arab-Israeli issues, Prince Saud said that he
<br>talked with Secretary Rice via telephone on February 4 about
<br>the Fatah-Hamas reconciliation meeting in Mecca. He said if
<br>they reach an agreement, the Saudis would hope for a positive
<br>US reaction.  He hoped that there would not be too many
<br>conditions placed upon Hamas in order for it to enter into a
<br>national unity government.  APHSCT Townsend said they US
<br>expected Hamas to stop fighting and to make progress on peace
<br>with Israel. More important than what they say is what they
<br>do, she stressed.  Saud stressed the importance of having
<br>clear guidelines and goals, which are applied to both sides
<br>of the conflict.  He said he expects Secretary Rice to return
<br>to the region, to meet with Prime Minister Olmert and
<br>President Abu Mazen.  He said he hopes she will address the
<br>substantive issues - Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees --
<br>and noted that it has been seven years since anyone has
<br>discussed the status of Jerusalem.  The side issues, for
<br>instance opening a passage between Gaza and the West Bank,
<br>should be handled at a different level, by Assistant
<br>Secretary Welch, he suggested.

<br>
<br>¶9.  (S) In a following private meeting with Saud, attended
<br>only by the Ambassador, APHSCT Townsend raised US concerns
<br>with the potential involvement of the Saudi ambassador to the
<br>Philippines Muhammad Amin Waly in terrorism facilitation,
<br>particularly his intervention to get two members of IIRO out
<br>of prison.  Prince Saud said some of his actions may have
<br>involved bad judgment rather than intentional support for
<br>terrorism.  Waly had been investigated, he said, and no
<br>evidence was found regarding his involvement.  Since this
<br>Ambassador's assignment in Manila would be ending in several
<br>months,  Saud asked for USG evidence of his involvement.
<br>APHSCT Townsend said the USG would cooperate with the
<br>Mubahith in providing evidence.
<br>
<br>¶10.  (S) Prince Saud then raised in the private meeting the
<br>Saudi Embassy in Washington's problems with the US bank that
<br>handles the Embassy account.  He asserted that the US bank is
<br>performing audits on the Saudi Embassy bank accounts beyond
<br>what is required by US law, and asking inappropriate and
<br>aggressive questions.  He noted that the Saudi Embassy enjoys
<br>diplomatic immunity.  If this is the bank's initiative, he
<br>asked for USG intercession.  APHSCT Townsend said we would
<br>look into it.
