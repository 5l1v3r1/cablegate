<br>REF: A. 09 STATE 130917 
<br>     ¶B. 09 BEIJING 003476 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: ISN/MTR DIRECTOR PAM DURHAM, REASON: 1.4 (C). 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (U) This is an action request.  Embassy Beijing, please 
<br>see paragraph 4. 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (S) Background/Objective: In December 2009, the United 
<br>States shared with China information regarding attempts by 
<br>the Malaysia-based firm Electronics Component Limited (ECL) 
<br>to buy TRS-500 gyroscopes from the Chinese firm VibTel 
<br>Industrial Co. Inc. (Ref A).  These gyroscopes, which are 
<br>controlled by the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) 
<br>and China's missile-related export controls, would be 
<br>suitable for use in the guidance systems of ballistic 
<br>missiles, cruise missiles, and unmanned aerial vehicles.  We 
<br>requested China investigate this information because ECL is 
<br>associated with a network of Iranian-controlled front 
<br>companies that procure sensitive goods on behalf of a number 
<br>of Iranian entities of proliferation concern. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (S) Chinese officials agreed to investigate this 
<br>information, but asked for additional details on ECL's 
<br>relationships with firms in Iran (Ref B).  To support their 
<br>efforts in this case, we would like to inform them that ECL 
<br>is part of a network of Iranian-controlled front companies 
<br>that includes the Iranian firm Shahin Sefid Esta and the 
<br>Malaysia-based front company Skylife Worldwide Sdn Bhd.  This 
<br>network procures sensitive goods on behalf of a number of 
<br>Iranian entities of proliferation concern, including the 
<br>United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 
<br>1737-designated entities Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group 
<br>(SHIG) and Ya Mahdi Industries.  We want to provide this 
<br>information to Chinese officials and emphasize that we 
<br>believe the transfer of this controlled equipment to a 
<br>company linked to UNSCR-designated entities would be 
<br>prohibited pursuant to UNSCR 1737. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (S) Action Request:  Request Embassy Beijing approach 
<br>appropriate host government officials to deliver talking 
<br>points/non-paper in paragraph 5 below and report response. 
<br>Talking points also may be provided as a non-paper. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (S) Begin talking points/non-paper: 
<br> 
<br>(SECRET//REL CHINA) 
<br> 
<br>--In December 2009, we shared with you information regarding 
<br>attempts by the Malaysia-based firm Electronics Component 
<br>Limited (ECL) to buy TRS-500 gyroscopes from the Chinese firm 
<br>VibTel Industrial Co. Inc. 
<br> 
<br>--TRS-500 gyroscopes are controlled by the Missile Technology 
<br>Control Regime (MTCR) and China's missile-related export 
<br>controls, and can be used in the guidance systems of 
<br>ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and unmanned aerial 
<br>vehicles. 
<br> 
<br>--We also noted that ECL is associated with a network of 
<br>Iranian-controlled front companies that procure sensitive 
<br>goods on behalf of a number of Iranian entities of 
<br>proliferation concern. 
<br> 
<br>--In response to this information, you agreed to look into 
<br>this matter, but asked if the United States could provide 
<br>additional details on ECL's relationships with firms in Iran. 
<br> 
<br>--We now want to provide you with additional information 
<br>indicating that ECL is part of a network of 
<br>Iranian-controlled front companies that includes the Iranian 
<br>firm Shahin Sefid Esta and the Malaysia-based front company 
<br>Skylife Worldwide Sdn Bhd. 
<br> 
<br>--This network procures sensitive goods on behalf of a number 
<br>of Iranian entities of proliferation concern, including the 
<br>Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group (SHIG), which is Iran's 
<br>primary developer of liquid propellant ballistic missiles, 
<br>and Heavy Metal Industries, a front company for the tactical 
<br>missile developer Ya Mahdi Industries. 
<br> 
<br>--Both SHIG and Ya Mahdi Industries are sanctioned under 
<br>United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1737. 
<br> 
<br>--Additionally, the TRS-500 gyroscopes are controlled items 
<br>that would be prohibited from being exported to Iran under 
<br>UNSCR 1737. 
<br> 
<br>--We hope this information is useful in supporting your 
<br>efforts in this case and assists your ability to prevent the 
<br>transfer of these gyroscopes by VibTel Industrial Co. to ECL. 
<br> 
<br>--We look forward to future cooperation on nonproliferation 
<br>issues and to hearing the results of your investigation into 
<br>this activity at the earliest possible time. 
<br> 
<br>End talking points/non-paper 
<br>

<br>202-647-1430).  Please slug any reporting on this issue for 
<br>ISN/MTR and EAP/CM.
