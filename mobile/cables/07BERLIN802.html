<br>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR ANGELA MERKEL IN WASHINGTON: GOALS 
<br>FOR EUROPE, GOALS AT HOME 
<br> 
<br>REF: BERLIN 747 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: DCM John Koenig.  Reason: 1.4(b) and (d) 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) Summary.  Angela Merkel arrives in Washington in an 
<br>enviable position of political strength, both at home and in 
<br>the EU.  However, she is conscious that her strength derives 
<br>largely from the weakness of her counterparts and other 
<br>factors beyond her control.  Achieving her goals for the EU - 
<br>in the trans-Atlantic context these are focused on climate 
<br>change and the Transatlantic Economic Initiative - will 
<br>reinforce her position at home and in the EU, and serve as a 
<br>springboard to success on the larger G-8 stage.  A success 
<br>for Merkel is also a success for the U.S.  Even after the 
<br>German EU Presidency, we will want the Atlanticist Merkel to 
<br>remain a dominant force within the EU.  In Berlin, a 
<br>successful summit will strengthen her and other 
<br>trans-Atlanticists against those who favor a policy of vocal, 
<br>public antagonism.  End Summary. 
<br> 
<br>Leading in the EU; Muddling Through at Home 
<br>------------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) Angela Merkel's role as Germany's and Europe's leader 
<br>is undisputed.  No other leader of a large member state is 
<br>politically fit enough to offer himself up as a leader.  Her 
<br>leadership of the G-8 and Germany's intrinsic weight and 
<br>economic recovery are further boosts.  At home, Merkel is not 
<br>only riding high in opinion polls (70 percent popularity 
<br>rating) and enjoying the benefits of leadership at a time of 
<br>long-sought economic growth, but has also wrong-footed her 
<br>coalition partner Social Democrats with reformist domestic 
<br>social policies.  However, in both cases her apparent 
<br>strength is not entirely of her own making, but derives in 
<br>large part from her office, the weakness of her counterparts, 
<br>or from other factors beyond her control.  She took the helm 
<br>of the EU at a time when progress on the European project had 
<br>largely come to a halt, when European institutions were 
<br>unsure of how or in which direction to move, and (as noted) 
<br>no alternative leaders were present. In Berlin, her coalition 
<br>partner and rival, the Social Democrats (SPD), are dealing 
<br>with weak leadership, a vacuum of ideas, and a challenge from 
<br>the left. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) Merkel has responded to these similar circumstances 
<br>with quite different tactics.  In the EU, she has asserted 
<br>German and her personal leadership over the Council 
<br>Secretariat, especially with respect to her goal of 
<br> 
<br>SIPDIS 
<br>developing a road map for furthering the EU constitution. 
<br>She has sidelined Brussels by putting her own representatives 
<br>on the road to discuss the constitution in other capitals and 
<br>has weighed in personally as needed to find compromises that 
<br>keep the constitutional project moving forward.  Likewise, 
<br>she has vigorously pursued the Transatlantic Economic 
<br>Initiative within the EU to remove regulatory barriers, and 
<br>has pushed for agreement on the new EU climate change and 
<br>energy initiatives.  She has not succeeded in all her 
<br>undertakings -- prospects for a new EU Partnership and 
<br>Cooperation Agreement with Russia remain distant, for 
<br>example.  Still, the view that we hear from Brussels is of 
<br>vigorous and effective leadership.  In Berlin, Merkel is 
<br>known for her reticence to engage in aggressive politics, 
<br>preferring to stay in the background until the "correlation 
<br>of forces" is clear and then engaging to nudge the debate in 
<br>her preferred direction.  Though the SPD is weak, Merkel has 
<br>been reluctant to push it hard.  Her strategy appears to be 
<br>aimed at building and consolidating her own and her party's 
<br>dominance with a view toward a clear victory in 2009 
<br>elections, rather than attempting to score victories now that 
<br>could alienate significant voter groups. 
<br> 
<br>Washington: What's In It for Merkel 
<br>----------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) We sum up Merkel's goal for the U.S.-EU Summit as 
<br>being to achieve substantive progress in the U.S.-EU 
<br>relationship for its own sake and to build a lasting 
<br>foundation for her leadership in the EU and in Germany.  The 
<br>substantive agenda is clear and we need not explore it in 
<br>detail here.  It is focused on our political cooperation in 
<br>key areas - climate change and energy security as well as the 
<br>Transatlantic Economic Initiative.  We recognize that in 
<br>these and other areas, European goals are not exactly aligned 
<br>with our own.  Nonetheless, success in these areas, the 
<br>former a key concern of European publics and the latter 
<br>important to sustaining European growth, after a long period 
<br>in which trans-Atlantic relations were dominated by negative 
<br>headlines and exchanges focused on other regions, would prove 
<br>Merkel's particular competence at succeeding in Europe's key 
<br>external relationship.  After success in Washington, Merkel 
<br> 
<br>BERLIN 00000802  002 OF 002 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>can count on maintaining her position in Europe against any 
<br>incoming French President and UK Prime Minister-in-waiting 
<br>Brown.  Success in Washington will also strengthen her hand 
<br>in the follow-on summits with Russia, Canada, and Japan and 
<br>sets the stage for success in G-8 summit deliberations on 
<br>climate change. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) At home, a Summit success may enable Merkel to end the 
<br>SPD's ability to use loud, public "principled" criticism of 
<br>the U.S. as a winning tactic.  Gerhard Schroeder won the 2002 
<br>election with his public attacks on U.S. Iraq policy, but if 
<br>Merkel brings home meaningful agreements -- especially on 
<br>issues with domestic resonance such as climate change and 
<br>trans-Atlantic economic cooperation -- she will have shown 
<br>the German public that her policy of constructive engagement 
<br>with the U.S. brings real benefits on issues of concern to 
<br>it.  Foreign policy, especially trans-Atlantic relations, is 
<br>one of the few areas where the SPD still enjoys greater 
<br>public support than does the CDU/CSU.  Success in Washington 
<br>may undercut the SPD on that theme, as the CDU/CSU has 
<br>already undercut it on many domestic social themes. 
<br> 
<br>A Note on Style 
<br>--------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) Merkel is pushing for a Summit that is more than a 
<br>predictable set-piece, quickly forgotten.  She looks for real 
<br>decisions to be made during the Summit discussions.  This 
<br>does more than just ensure that she has something important 
<br>to do.  It emphasizes her personal commitment to restoring 
<br>European-American relations and her belief in face-to-face 
<br>engagement.  We recognize the difficulty of organizing 
<br>discussions in this format, but believe we too stand to gain 
<br>by such an approach. 
<br> 
<br>What's In This for Washington 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) Post has previously reported on Merkel's risk-averse 
<br>approach to foreign policy.  We do not expect her to change 
<br>her leadership style because of success in Washington.  The 
<br>real benefits for the U.S. lie in how success will affect the 
<br>public understanding of how Germany can best build a 
<br>relationship with Washington and its view of the U.S., the 
<br>changing of which is a frequent theme in conversations with 
<br>German leaders and thinkers.  A successful Summit will also 
<br>reinforce our message that the U.S. and EU are natural 
<br>partners, closely bound by common interests.  As a cautious 
<br>conservative in a difficult coalition, Merkel will not run 
<br>great risks for the U.S.  But, if she can show the public 
<br>that cooperation with the U.S. works, the effect will be to 
<br>cut the risk she runs by cooperating with the U.S.  It is a 
<br>more complex path to a closer and more effective relationship 
<br>than we would perhaps like, but our observation of Merkel and 
<br>our conversations with her advisors lead us to see it as the 
<br>best path available.
