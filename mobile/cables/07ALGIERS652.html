<br>SUBJECT: ALGERIANS OFFER NEARLY ALL ASSURANCES NEEDED FOR 
<br>RETURN OF GTMO DETAINEES 
<br>
<br>REF: 2005 ALGIERS 2155 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Robert S. Ford, reasons 1.4 (b,d) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) SUMMARY: In April 21-22 discussions led on the 
<br>Algerian side by Counselor to the President for 
<br>Counterterrorism Issues Kamel Rezag Bara, the government of 
<br>Algeria gave oral assurances to S/WCI Ambassador Williamson 
<br>and an interagency delegation to establish the terms for the 
<br>transfer of Algerian detainees from the U.S. Naval Base at 
<br>Guantanamo to Algeria. A working group consisting of members 
<br>of both delegations encapsulated these oral assurances in 
<br>written minutes of the meetings, which Williamson and Rezag 
<br>Bara initialed at the end of the two-day dialogue. The 
<br>meetings and their output produced sufficient assurances to 
<br>permit the repatriation of the seven Algerian detainees 
<br>scheduled for transfer, except with respect to ensuring that 
<br>these individuals would not pose a security risk to the U.S. 
<br>or international community. The Algerian delegation 
<br>indicated that it took seriously its obligations, but that 
<br>Algerian security services balked at providing such 
<br>guarantees in the written meeting minutes. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) SUMMARY (CONT'D): Ambassador Williamson explained to 
<br>Rezag Bara that we sought maximum effort from the security 
<br>services, understanding that there could be no solid 
<br>guarantees. Nonetheless, Rezag Bara said the security 
<br>assurances in writing sought by the U.S. on Algerian 
<br>responsibility for transferred detainees and potential travel 
<br>restrictions after their repatriation could not be given 
<br>without consulting the highest levels of the Algerian 
<br>government. In exchange for receiving additional time (until 
<br>May 31) to coordinate on these outstanding points, Rezag Bara 
<br>and the Algerian delegation agreed to the earliest possible 
<br>transfer of detainee Sofiane Haderbache, who suffers from 
<br>mental illness and for whom the U.S. does not require 
<br>security assurances. At the close of the bilateral 
<br>discussions, both sides agreed that the remaining assurances 
<br>would be worked out between the Algerian and U.S. delegations 
<br>through Embassy Algiers. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>COURTESY CALL ON FM BEDJAOUI 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) S/WCI Ambassador at Large J. Clint Williamson and an 
<br>interagency team consisting of Christopher Camponovo (NSC), 
<br>Jay Alan Liotta (DoD), Andrew Morrison (S/WCI), and Vijay 
<br>Padmanabhan (State L) sought assurances from the government 
<br>of Algeria during April 21-22 discussions that would permit 
<br>the return to Algeria of Algerian nationals detained at 
<br>Guantanamo who have been approved for transfer. Williamson 
<br>opened the visit with a courtesy call on FM Bedjaoui during 
<br>which he delivered a letter from Secretary Rice seeking 
<br>Bedjaoui's assistance in providing the Algerian government 
<br>assurances necessary for the transfers. Williamson also 
<br>explained the process by which the U.S. made decisions on 
<br>transferring detainees out of Guantanamo, including the 25 
<br>Algerians on the naval base. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) Noting Algerian reluctance to enter into an exchange 
<br>of diplomatic notes offering assurances on security and 
<br>humane treatment of transferred detainees, Williamson told 
<br>Bedjaoui he and his team could work with their Algerian 
<br>counterparts to record the necessary assurances in signed 
<br>minutes of their discussions. The end goal, stated 
<br>Williamson, was to find an arrangement that both fulfilled 
<br>the Administration's policies and satisfied the Algerian 
<br>government. Bedjaoui responded that the Algerian team would 
<br>accommodate Williamson and his team, adding that signed 
<br>minutes were a better vehicle for conveying the necessary 
<br>assurances than an exchange of diplomatic notes. The FM 
<br>observed that the travaux preparatoires for the UN Charter 
<br>are as important as the Charter itself. 
<br>
<br>DISCUSSIONS WITH ALGERIAN INTERAGENCY 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) The Algerian delegation led by presidential 
<br>counterterrorism Counselor Kamel Rezag Bara included 
<br>representatives from the Presidency, Ministry of Interior, 
<br>National Police, security services, Ministry of Justice, and 
<br>the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The senior MFA official 
<br>present was Director General for Consular Affairs Hassane 
<br>Rabehi. The U.S. representatives (paragraph 3) also included 
<br>Ambassador Ford and PolEc Chief. Ambassador Williamson noted 
<br>that the Algerians were a valued partner in counterterrorism 
<br>cooperation and gave an overview of U.S. policy on Guantanamo 
<br>detainees, explaining that the U.S had determined that seven 
<br>Algerian detainees were eligible for transfer. He emphasized 
<br>our need for commitments concerning humanitarian treatment 
<br>for returned detainees and assurances that persons 
<br>
<br>transferred do not re-engage in terrorist activity before 
<br>their transfer to Algeria could be effected. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S) Rezag Bara said Algeria encouraged the U.S. to close 
<br>the Guantanamo detention facility, since its operation 
<br>created image problems for the U.S. among its friends around 
<br>the world. The GOA, he continued, understood the need for 
<br>investigations at Guantanamo on the detained individuals and 
<br>supported a resolution of all Algerian detainee cases. Rezag 
<br>Bara said the Algerian delegation understood what kinds of 
<br>assurances and commitments the U.S. side sought and hoped to 
<br>provide them in the course of their bilateral discussions. 
<br>The presidential counselor stressed the Algerian need to 
<br>ensure that any transferred detainees, unless previously 
<br>arrested or charged in Algeria, were returning to the country 
<br>by their own choice. Finally, he noted that Algerian law 
<br>criminalized terrorist acts committed outside Algeria, even 
<br>if Algeria was not a target of the activity. In this regard, 
<br>the U.S. delegation should expect the Algerian government to 
<br>pursue investigations and charges for returned detainees. 
<br>From its own experience with terrorism, Rezag Bara told 
<br>Williamson, Algeria would take all measures possible to 
<br>prevent re-engagement of the returned detainees in terrorist 
<br>activity. 
<br>
<br>LIMITS ON FOREIGN TRAVEL 
<br>------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) Williamson responded that he saw very few differences 
<br>in approach between the two sides. Algeria's taking steps to 
<br>control detainees and keep them from returning to terrorism 
<br>would be sufficient for the U.S. Williamson made clear we 
<br>were not asking Algeria to detain or incarcerate the returned 
<br>detainees; it was sufficient for us to receive confirmation 
<br>that the transferred detainees would be treated in accordance 
<br>with Algerian law and international conventions. DoD's 
<br>Liotta expressed appreciation for the Algerian readiness to 
<br>accept responsibility for what would be in all cases medium- 
<br>or high-threat detainees. He asked if based on Algerian 
<br>review of the detaineesQ, case files there was the likelihood 
<br>of prosecution. Liotta also inquired what measures could be 
<br>taken to limit the foreign travel of returned detainees. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (S) To Liotta's first point, the justice ministry 
<br>representative responded that an investigative judge would 
<br>review facts related to the cases if the detainees once they 
<br>were returned. It would be up to the judge to determine 
<br>whether charges would be filed. Rezag Bara added that as 
<br>part of this judicial review process, the U.S. and other 
<br>third parties could submit evidence for the judge to 
<br>consider. The national police representative, for his part, 
<br>briefed that under Algerian law "convicted and subversive 
<br>persons" lose the right to a passport and are subject to 
<br>additional surveillance. Liotta requested further precision 
<br>about non-convicted persons, since most Algerian detainees 
<br>fell into this category. Rezag Bara clarified that the 
<br>passport was lifted for all convicted persons. Persons who 
<br>"otherwise present a threat but retain a passport" may be 
<br>administratively prevented from leaving Algeria regardless of 
<br>their passport status, said Rezag Bara. He added that both 
<br>judicial and security service reviews of the detainees' files 
<br>would be undertaken following their return. 
<br>
<br>CASE OF SOFIANE HADERBACHE 
<br>-------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶9. (S) Williamson noted that one of the seven detainees whom 
<br>the U.S. sought to transfer to Algeria did not pose a 
<br>security threat and no security assurances were necessary in 
<br>his case. Sofiane Haderbache, said Williamson, had suffered 
<br>a gunshot wound to the head in Afghanistan. As a result, 
<br>this detainee had degenerative brain damage and would require 
<br>extensive medical care for the duration of his life. 
<br>Williamson indicated that the U.S. sought to return this 
<br>detainee quickly, since we believed the mental health 
<br>treatment and attention he required would be well provided in 
<br>Algeria, where Haderbache could be near family and friends 
<br>and receive mental health care in his own language and 
<br>culture. Asked how the Algerians would address Haderbache's 
<br>mental incapacity, Rezag Bara retrieved the case file. 
<br>Reading from it, Rezag Bara noted that Haderbache had one 
<br>outstanding traffic violation but otherwise had no legal 
<br>entanglements. He said the GOA was fully aware of his unique 
<br>medical requirements and was prepared to provide Haderbache a 
<br>psychological and medical evaluation and treatment in an 
<br>appropriate facility upon his return. 
<br>
<br>HUMANE TREATMENT AND ICRC ACCESS TO ALGERIAN PRISONERS 
<br>--------------------- ------------------- -------------- 
<br>
<br>¶10. (S) Bara had explained in his opening presentation that 
<br>
<br>returned detainees would be fully protected by Algerian law 
<br>and Algerian international human rights commitments. 
<br>Returning to the other six detainees who posed a medium or 
<br>high security threat, Williamson asked if third parties such 
<br>as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had 
<br>access to prisoners in Algeria in the event that some of the 
<br>returned detainees were held in penal facilities for a period 
<br>of time. Rezag Bara responded that through intelligence 
<br>channels the Algerian government could provide the location 
<br>of government facilities in which any returned detainees 
<br>would be held and questioned under the oversight of an 
<br>investigative judge and the Ministry of Justice. The GOA, he 
<br>continued, had no problem with making that information 
<br>available or providing the ICRC access to the detainees under 
<br>existing agreements between the ICRC and the Ministry of 
<br>Justice. Rezag Bara added that ICRC personnel stationed in 
<br>Tunis visited Algerian prisons on a monthly basis to assess 
<br>conditions under which prisoners were held. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (S) In a separate meeting, Williamson met April 22 with 
<br>Mohamed Amara, Director General of Juridical and Judicial 
<br>Affairs at the Ministry of Justice. Amara noted as a point 
<br>of pride the strong cooperation between his government and 
<br>the ICRC, which he explained was critical to the reform of 
<br>jails and prisons in Algeria. He elaborated that the ICRC 
<br>regularly visited Algerian prisons. In response to a 
<br>question from Williamson, Amara explained that the Algerians 
<br>began allowing ICRC access to their detention facilities in 
<br>the 1990s. The ICRC currently, said Amara, has freedom to 
<br>move within Algerian prisons and have direct contact with 
<br>prisoners. He added there are no restrictions on access or 
<br>topics of conversation. According to Amara, AlgeriaQ,s goal 
<br>in cooperating with the ICRC is to ensure that Algeria meets 
<br>international standards of detention. 
<br>
<br>DEVIL IN THE DETAILS 
<br>-------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶12. (S) Following the discussions between the two 
<br>delegations, both sides assembled teams to prepare minutes of 
<br>the conversations that would satisfy the U.S. need for 
<br>assurances and the Algerian desire not to provide such 
<br>assurances through the exchange of diplomatic notes. The 
<br>final English-language version of the minutes, which appears 
<br>in paragraph 13 below, was initialed April 22 by both heads 
<br>of delegation along with the final French-language version. 
<br>After protracted discussions led to an impasse on the 
<br>inclusion in the minutes of two security-related points vital 
<br>for the U.S. side, Ambassador Ford proposed working through 
<br>Embassy Algiers to provide acceptable assurances to 
<br>Washington by May 31. (Note: Without additional internal 
<br>discussions, the Algerian security services could not be 
<br>persuaded to lift their objection to including language 
<br>confirming GOAQ,s responsibility for transferred detainees. 
<br>End Note.) Rezag Bara stressed the security services were 
<br>uncomfortable guaranteeing that no returned detainee would 
<br>later leave Algerian territory or return to terrorist 
<br>activity. Williamson emphasized that the U.S. was looking 
<br>for 100-percent effort and understood no 100-percent 
<br>guarantee is possible. If the Algerian authorities become 
<br>aware that a detainee exited Algeria, we merely ask to be 
<br>informed, stated Williamson. The points in question which 
<br>did not appear in the final minutes at GOA request follow: 
<br>
<br>-- The Algerian government has agreed to take responsibility 
<br>for these persons in conformity with its legislation and its 
<br>international obligations, and will take all necessary and 
<br>appropriate measures in conformity with its legislation and 
<br>its international obligations to prevent the transferred 
<br>persons from becoming involved in or facilitating terrorist 
<br>activities. 
<br>
<br>-- In response to an expressed request of the American 
<br>Government concerning the possibility of the restriction of 
<br>the freedom to travel abroad of the transferred persons, the 
<br>Algerian Government indicated that measures of this nature 
<br>will be taken only in the framework of legislative provisions 
<br>in force. 
<br>
<br>FINAL MINUTES AS INITIALED BY HEADS OF DELEGATION 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br>
<br>¶13. (S) BEGIN TEXT OF MINUTES: 
<br>
<br>Mr. John Clint WILLIAMSON, Ambassador at Large for War 
<br>Crimes Issues at the U.S. Department of State, conducted a 
<br>working visit to Algiers from April 20 to 22, 2007, 
<br>accompanied by a delegation composed of representatives from 
<br>the Department of State, the Department of Defense and the 
<br>National Security Council. 
<br>
<br>During his visit, Mr. John Clint WILLIAMSON called on 
<br>Mr. Mohammed BEDJAOUI, Minister of State, Minister of Foreign 
<br>Affairs, to whom he delivered a letter from Secretary of 
<br>State Condoleezza RICE. 
<br>
<br>He was also received at the Ministry of Justice. 
<br>
<br>A bilateral meeting bringing together delegations from 
<br>the two countries (the members of which appear on the 
<br>attached list) took place at Residence El Mithak on April 21 
<br>and 22, 2007, under the chairmanship of Mr. Mohamed Kamel 
<br>REZAG BARA, Counselor to the President of the Republic, and 
<br>Mr. John Clint WILLIAMSON, Ambassador at Large for War Crimes 
<br>Issues at the U.S. Department of State. 
<br>
<br>The discussions concerned the situation of Algerian nationals 
<br>detained at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo. 
<br>
<br>The Algerian Delegation and the American Delegation expressed 
<br>their great satisfaction with the quality of relations that 
<br>exist between the PeopleQ,s Democratic Republic of Algeria 
<br>and the United States of America and with the perspectives 
<br>for their expansion and strengthening. 
<br>
<br>Both Delegations particularly expressed their joint will to 
<br>reach a comprehensive settlement concerning the situation of 
<br>Algerian nationals detained in the U.S. Naval Base at 
<br>Guantanamo. 
<br>
<br>This settlement can be finalized according to a timetable and 
<br>practical modalities to be defined through discussions 
<br>between the two Delegations by the end of May 2007. 
<br>
<br>The Algerian Delegation indicated that it had no objection to 
<br>the transfer of the Algerian nationals whose Algerian 
<br>nationality is established, to Algeria or to another country 
<br>of their choice. 
<br>
<br>The Algerian Delegation stated that in all cases, its 
<br>nationals will be brought before the national judicial 
<br>authority, which will ultimately determine their status. 
<br>
<br>The Algerian Delegation underscored that Algerian legislation 
<br>criminalizes membership by any Algerian national in a 
<br>terrorist organization abroad, even if acts committed are not 
<br>directed against Algeria. 
<br>With respect to the concerns expressed by the American 
<br>Delegation about the treatment of the Algerian nationals 
<br>after their return to Algeria, the two Delegations, after an 
<br>exchange of information, agreed that these concerns are dealt 
<br>with, at a political level, by the consistent commitment of 
<br>Algeria to the fight against international terrorism and, at 
<br>a legal level, by Algerian legislation as well as by virtue 
<br>of the obligations assumed by Algeria in the framework of the 
<br>different pertinent international conventions to which it has 
<br>adhered, notably the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
<br>the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
<br>Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and the International 
<br>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
<br>Discrimination, as well as the body of international 
<br>instruments relating to human rights and the arrangements 
<br>concluded with the ICRC. 
<br>Within the framework of relevant UN Security Council 
<br>Resolutions for combating terrorism, particularly UNSCR 
<br>1373/01, the two Delegations decided to reinforce their 
<br>cooperation through necessary and appropriate measures, 
<br>notably through the exchange of information and intelligence, 
<br>with the goal of preventing these persons from being able to 
<br>become involved in terrorist activities. 
<br>
<br>Taking account of the preceding, the two Delegations accepted 
<br>the principle, as a first step, upon the agreement of 
<br>practical modalities, of the transfer of detainees whose 
<br>names are as follows: 
<br>
<br>- TRARI Mohamed 
<br>- FEGHOUL Abdelli 
<br>- HAMLILI Mustapha 
<br>- ABBAR Houari 
<br>- GHALLAB Bachir 
<br>- HADJ-ARAB Nabil 
<br>
<br>Due to his health condition, Sofiane HADERBACHE is to be 
<br>transferred as soon as possible. 
<br>
<br>END TEXT. 
<br>
<br>¶14. (U) Ambassador Williamson and his delegation have cleared 
<br>the text of this message.
