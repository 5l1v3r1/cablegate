<br>SUBJECT: FRENCH MFA READOUT ON AUGUST 23 TEHRAN VISIT BY 
<br>ELYSEE ADVISER RICHIER AND MFA DAS GELLET 
<br> 
<br>REF: PARIS 3645 (NOTAL) 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Classified By: Political Minister-Counselor Josiah Rosen 
<br>blatt for reasons 1.4. (b) and (d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (C)  Summary:  The GOF took a hard line during an August 
<br>23 trip to Tehran by French presidency strategic affairs 
<br>adviser Richier and French MFA DAS-equivalent Gellet that 
<br>Iranian leader Khamanei's foreign policy adviser Velayati 
<br>hoped would open a new channel to Paris.  Gellet explained 
<br>August 31 that Velayati was apparently operating from a 
<br>flawed premise that Nicolas Sarkozy would free France from 
<br>its "dependence" on the USG.  Velayati further believed 
<br>France could be broken away from the P-5 over further 
<br>sanctions against Iran.  Gellet said Richier previewed for 
<br>Velayati the line Sarkozy would use in a subsequent speech to 
<br>French ambassadors that the world faced a "catastrophic" 
<br>choice between Iran with a bomb or bombing Iran.  Although 
<br>Velayati's hopes were shattered, Iran is still interested in 
<br>the channel; Gellet said that Richier has the lead in 
<br>deciding what the GOF will do next.  Gellet expressed a 
<br>strong French desire to remain informed on U.S. plans 
<br>regarding Iran particularly should we decide to take military 
<br>action against Iran.  End summary 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (C)  French MFA DAS-equivalent for Iran, Iraq, and the 
<br>Gulf Franck Gellet on August 31 provided a readout on his 
<br>August 23 visit to Tehran accompanying the French 
<br>presidency's strategic affairs adviser Francois Richier.  The 
<br>visit followed an invitation from Ali Akbar Velayati, former 
<br>Iranian foreign minister and current foreign affairs adviser 
<br>to Supreme Leader Khamanei.  Gellet confirmed information 
<br>that the French Embassy in Washington communicated to the 
<br>Department that Velayati wanted to establish a new direct 
<br>channel to Paris.  Gellet elaborated that Velayati's 
<br>(apparently convoluted) thinking had been expressed in an 
<br>article he had written that took the view that the election 
<br>of Nicolas Sarkozy gave France a chance to break free of its 
<br>"dependence" on the U.S. in terms of its foreign policy. 
<br>Velayati, according to Gellet, believed that Chirac had been 
<br>entirely beholden to the U.S. during his presidency. 
<br>Sarkozy's election, therefore, offered Iran a chance to 
<br>appeal to France in a way that would allow France to follow 
<br>its independent line a la de Gaulle and thus pry France loose 
<br>from the coalition that now sought to impose tougher 
<br>sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C)  Despite this clearly flawed analysis of France's 
<br>position and political dynamics, the GOF decided this opening 
<br>was important enough to explore.  Gellet recounted how he and 
<br>Richier met Velayati, heard him out, and proceeded to burst 
<br>his bubble.  Richier, according to Gellet, told Velayati that 
<br>Sarkozy was firm on the nuclear issue and previewed for him 
<br>the line that Sarkozy would use in his August 29 speech to 
<br>French ambassadors that under current circumstances the world 
<br>faced the stark alternative that Iran would obtain "the bomb" 
<br>or be bombed.  Velayati was not happy to hear this but did 
<br>not close the door to further discussion.  Gellet surmised 
<br>that Velayati believes the French are still susceptible to 
<br>Iranian blandishments and wants to keep some sort of 
<br>alternative line open to the Elysee. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (C)  Gellet stressed that Velayati's initiative was not 
<br>taken without reference to others in the Iranian government. 
<br>Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for Legal and International 
<br>Affairs Abbas Araghchi sat in on the Velayati meeting just as 
<br>Velayati attended a meeting Gellet and Richier had with 
<br>Araghchi.  Gellet did not indicate what other subjects came 
<br>up, but Velayati's pitch was the main one.  When asked 
<br>whether France felt the visit had been worthwhile and what 
<br>sort of follow-up there might be, Gellet was vague.  He said 
<br>that Richier, in his Elyse capacity, would decide what to 
<br>do, including whether to keep this dialogue going.  Gellet 
<br>surmised that Richier would be willing to discuss this 
<br>further with USG officials, like PM A/S Rood, in future 
<br>meetings to discuss next steps in the nuclear fuel dispute. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (C)  Gellet found the visit a bit surreal but quite 
<br>indicative of the bizarre way Iran functions.  He noted the 
<br>diffusion of power among different entities and the 
<br>uncertainty that pervades Iranian decision making.  Velayati 
<br>clearly sought to minimize or counterbalance President 
<br>Ahmadinejad's hard line but without actually taking a softer 
<br>line himself.  Iran's core position, therefore, did not seem 
<br>to be shifting or subject to any flexibility.  When asked how 
<br>France understood Sarkozy's either/or statement on Iran had 
<br>played in that country, Gellet replied that Iranian 
<br>authorities seem to have largely kept it out of the national 
<br>media.  The implication that France sees Iran facing a 
<br>serious risk of military retaliation over its stance was thus 
<br>largely unreported.  Gellet argued that this suits Velayati's 
<br>calculations because the impression remains that Iran can 
<br> 
<br>PARIS 00003668  002 OF 002 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>somehow turn to France to blunt American pressure to impose 
<br>more sanctions and escalate the situation. 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (C)  On the issue of escalation, Gellet asked that the 
<br>USG keep France informed of its thinking as regards possible 
<br>military action against Iran.  He claimed that the Elysee 
<br>worries about being blindsided if or when the time comes for 
<br>a strike.  The timing and magnitude of such action, i.e., a 
<br>surgical strike or a more generalized campaign, could have 
<br>enormous stakes in terms of French interests.  Gellet noted, 
<br>in this vein, French concerns about Iranian retaliation 
<br>against the Gulf States and their capacity to respond.  He 
<br>surmised that a U.S./France dialogue, if it were to develop, 
<br>might occur at a much higher level than his.  His hope, which 
<br>was personal as much as he said it reflected official 
<br>thinking, was that we would keep the French in the loop as we 
<br>moved into the next phase of high-tension diplomacy focused 
<br>on further UNSC sanctions. 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (C)  Comment:  It appears that this latest Iranian 
<br>initiative to open a new channel to Paris is unlikely to 
<br>change the dynamics of Tehran's ongoing confrontation with 
<br>the world.  The French seem keen to reassure us that they are 
<br>not wavering.  President Sarkozy's tough words to the French 
<br>Ambassadors conference following the meetings in Tehran made 
<br>that point loud and clear.  On whether to engage more 
<br>intensively with the French about the various contingencies 
<br>related to Iran, we believe we should continue to test 
<br>Sarkozy's apparent desire to deal with us differently than 
<br>his predecessors did.  As an indication of different French 
<br>thinking, the newspaper "Le Monde" reported active discussion 
<br>in the Elysee of sanctions targeting Iran outside the UNSC 
<br>that France could impose alone or potentially with others in 
<br>the EU.  The article made clear that, as "fissures" seem to 
<br>be appearing among the P-5 over Iran, France seems to be 
<br>toughening its position.  We will follow up with Richier for 
<br>his take on this visit.
