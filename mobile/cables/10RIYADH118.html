<br>SUBJECT: SAUDI FOREIGN MINISTRY PRESSING CHINA TO STOP 
<br>IRANIAN PROLIFERATION, CONCERNED ABOUT TSA REGULATIONS 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Ambassador James B. Smith, reasons 1.4 (b and d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Saudi Foreign Ministry officials told 
<br>visiting NEA A/S Feltman that they are convinced Iran intends 
<br>to develop a nuclear weapon, and that the Saudi Foreign 
<br>Minister pressed his counterpart hard for greater Chinese 
<br>engagement on this threat during the Chinese FM's visit 
<br>earlier in January.  While no explicit deal was discussed, 
<br>Saudi Arabia made it clear it was willing to address Chinese 
<br>concerns on energy security and trade in exchange for 
<br>effective Chinese support to prevent Iranian proliferation. 
<br>Saudi Arabia is also concerned about Iran's unhelpful role in 
<br>Yemen.  While generally very pleased with the state of 
<br>bilateral relations, Saudi officials strenuously - and under 
<br>instruction - complained about the continued negative effect 
<br>of the recent Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) 
<br>regulations that call for extra security screening for Saudi 
<br>Arabia.  The Saudi Foreign Minister will raise these concerns 
<br>with the Secretary in London on January 27.  They noted that 
<br>the Saudi public is increasingly upset by this, and does not 
<br>understand why they were put in the same group with Cuba, 
<br>which has prompted some Saudis to question how special their 
<br>relationship with the United States really is.  A/S Feltman 
<br>urged Saudi Arabia to associate itself with the Copenhagen 
<br>Accord by January 31.  The MFA reported that Saudi Arabia 
<br>donated $50 million for Haitian relief efforts on January 25. 
<br> End Summary. 
<br> 
<br>Iranian Nuclear Ambitions: 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) Visiting NEA A/S Feltman discussed a wide range of 
<br>issues with Deputy Saudi Foreign Minister Dr. Prince Torki 
<br>Al-Saud Al-Kabir on January 26.  Prince Torki said Saudi 
<br>Arabia is convinced that Iran intends to develop nuclear 
<br>weapons, and reported that Saudi Foreign Minister Saud 
<br>Al-Faisal pressed the Chinese Foreign Minister on this issue 
<br>on his January 17 visit.  Saud Al-Faisal told the Chinese 
<br>that, for Saudi Arabia, this is a critical security issue. 
<br>Iran,s getting nuclear weapons will open the door to the 
<br>rest of the Middle East pursuing nuclear weapons.  Saudi 
<br>Arabia would prefer that the Middle East remain a nuclear 
<br>free zone.  When the Chinese Foreign Minister replied that 
<br>China will not accept Iran's development of nuclear weapons, 
<br>Saud Al-Faisal told him that China will have to work more 
<br>closely with the rest of the world and the UN Security 
<br>Council to prevent this from happening. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) Prince Torki agreed that it was not helpful that the 
<br>Chinese sent a low-level delegation to the most recent 5 1 
<br>talks.  He also agreed it was unfortunate the delegation did 
<br>not agree it was time now to increase pressure on Iran. 
<br>Al-Kabir also noted that time was not in the UN Security 
<br>Council's favor, but in Iran's.  Prince Torki said that Saudi 
<br>Arabia was convinced the time was ripe to push China on this 
<br>issue.  It would be important to demonstrate that the 
<br>assurances FM Al-Faisal got were not just from the Foreign 
<br>Minister, but represented the thinking of the whole 
<br>government.  He said that Saudi Arabia repeated these points 
<br>to the Chinese Middle East special envoy, who visited a week 
<br>later.  Saudi Arabia has also raised these concerns with 
<br>Russia, "which is closer to the U.S. and Saudi positions," 
<br>and with the Deputy French Foreign Minister three weeks ago. 
<br>Prince Torki also agreed to work with Lebanon's UN Mission, 
<br>now on the Security Council, where it is sure to confront the 
<br>issue of Iranian proliferation. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) Prince Torki said that China never directly raised the 
<br>issue of its concerns about securing sufficient oil supplies, 
<br>particularly in the event of a cutoff of Iranian supplies. 
<br>However, Saudi Arabia fully understands China's concerns, and 
<br>in that context, is pleased that the Chinese Foreign Minister 
<br>had &successful8 talks with Saudi Aramco and trade 
<br>officials about specific commercial and energy issues. 
<br>Prince Torki noted that Saudi Arabia has become one of 
<br>China's largest energy suppliers, and has invested billions 
<br>of dollars in refineries in China.  Trade has grown from $140 
<br>million a decade ago to $75 billion now, with prospects for 
<br>further increases.  Prince Torki concluded by noting that 
<br>Saudi Arabia knows what concerns China, and is willing to 
<br>take actions to address those concerns, but must have Chinese 
<br>cooperation in stopping Iran,s development of nuclear 
<br>weapons as a quid pro quo.  Saudi Arabia is encouraging other 
<br> 
<br>Gulf countries to meet with China to explore similar 
<br>cooperation, although it expects these countries will seek 
<br>the same exchange. 
<br> 
<br>Yemen: 
<br>- - - - 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) Prince Torki explained that Saudi Arabia also believes 
<br>that Iran is playing an unhelpful role in Yemen.  Dismissing 
<br>the need for specific evidence, he said it was hard to 
<br>explain how the Houthis, as a poor tribal group, managed to 
<br>get so much money so quickly to obtain the heavy armaments 
<br>that they have been using absent the help of some outside 
<br>group.  It is also hard, he argued, to explain the striking 
<br>similarities with techniques that have been used by 
<br>pro-Iranian groups in Iraq.  Saudi Arabia is convinced that 
<br>Iran is providing money for poor tribesmen to fight, as well 
<br>as payments to their families, and is facilitating contact 
<br>with Somalia and Al Qaeda.  Prince Torki said the Saudi 
<br>Defense Forces have been impressed how well the Houthis have 
<br>fought, displaying advanced training.  (Note: in a separate 
<br>meeting, Ministry of Interior officials echoed many of these 
<br>assessments in greater detail, septel.  End Note). 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) Prince Torki was unequivocal in stating that Saudi 
<br>Arabia has no intention of becoming part of the current 
<br>conflict between the central government and the Houthis. 
<br>Saudi Arabia felt it had to respond, however, after Houthi 
<br>forces crossed its border.  He said that it made little sense 
<br>for the Houthis to have attacked Saudi Arabia, especially 
<br>since the SAG had warned them previously not to.  He 
<br>concluded that Iran was trying to test Saudi reactions. 
<br>Yemen does not need U.S. troops, but does need equipment, 
<br>training and information, as well as assistance to meet its 
<br>long-term development challenges.  He also said that Saudi 
<br>Arabia is very concerned about Al Qaeda's continued presence 
<br>in Yemen, as it will exploit any opportunity to attack Saudi 
<br>Arabia and the United States. 
<br> 
<br>Bilateral Relations: 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C). Prince Torki agreed that our bilateral relations are 
<br>quite strong in general.  He singled out counter-terrorism as 
<br>an example of the strength of cooperation, noting that Saudi 
<br>Arabia enjoys a unique level of cooperation on security with 
<br>the United States.  Prince Torki confirmed that Saudi Arabia 
<br>had contributed $50 million to the Haiti relief effort on 
<br>January 25, which is the largest contribution to date of any 
<br>Middle Eastern country.  He also welcomed greater U.S. 
<br>engagement in multilateral and international organizations. 
<br> 
<br>Climate Change: 
<br>- - - - - - - - 
<br> 
<br>8.(SBU) A/S Feltman noted the importance that the President 
<br>places on Climate Change, and the Copenhagen Accord.  Given 
<br>that Minister of Petroleum Al-Naimi was involved in crafting 
<br>the final agreement, A/S Feltman noted the United States is 
<br>counting on Saudi Arabia to associate itself with the accord 
<br>by January 31.  Prince Torki said that Saudi Arabia was very 
<br>pleased the United States was more actively engaged in this 
<br>issue, and said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs supports 
<br>trying to address this issue.  He noted that the MFA will 
<br>have to consult with other involved ministries, such as the 
<br>Ministry of Petroleum, and promised to respond before January 
<br>¶31. 
<br> 
<br>Concern over TSA Regulations: 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (SBU) Prince Torki noted he had been instructed to raise 
<br>Saudi Arabia's significant concern about the TSA regulations 
<br>which had included Saudi Arabia in a limited group of 
<br>countries for additional airport screening.  Prince Torki 
<br>said that this issue had caused a lot of difficulties and 
<br>embarrassment for Saudi Arabia, to the degree that Foreign 
<br>Minister Saud Al-Faisal will raise this with the Secretary in 
<br>London on January 27.  Prince Torki said that Saudi Arabia 
<br>was not upset about the regulation itself, as it recognized 
<br>the U.S. right and obligation to protect its citizens.  The 
<br>issue, rather, was inclusion on the list with the likes of 
<br>Cuba, which causes Saudi Arabia's friends and enemies to 
<br> 
<br>question how strong its bilateral relationship with the 
<br>United States really is.  Prince Torki said it is very hard 
<br>to explain to the Saudi public why they are included on this 
<br>list, despite not being the origin of the December 25 flight, 
<br>while other countries that have had recent terrorist 
<br>incidents on planes, like the UK, Egypt and Turkey, are not. 
<br>Prince Torki said that Saudi Arabia had been shocked to be 
<br>included on the list.  He noted that Saudi Arabia had been 
<br>told these provisions would only be temporary, and said Saudi 
<br>Arabia would like to know how and when they will be amended, 
<br>implying that the longer they remained in effect without any 
<br>public explanation from the USG, the more it was likely to 
<br>prompt the Saudi Government to re-evaluate areas of 
<br>cooperation, including counter-terrorism cooperation.  A/S 
<br>Feltman promised to convey the spirit and strength of the 
<br>message, and invited any specific Saudi suggestions to 
<br>address the security gap regarding nonmetallic explosives 
<br>exploited in the December 25 incident. 
<br> 
<br>Middle East Peace: 
<br>- - - - - - - - - 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (C) In response to a question, A/S Feltman explained that 
<br>the United States believes that we need to get the Israelis 
<br>and the Palestinians back to the negotiating table, which 
<br>will be the best way to compel Israel to follow through on 
<br>its public statements and to overcome Palestinian skepticism. 
<br> A/S Feltman noted that the United States had referred to the 
<br>1967 lines with swaps as a way of helping encourage the 
<br>Palestinians to return to the table.  Prince Torki welcomed 
<br>this overview. 
<br> 
<br>(U) This cable has been cleared by A/S Feltman.
