<br>Classified By: CDA Alan Misenheimer for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: The reaction by the Kuwaiti media and GOK
<br>to the January 16 UN Security Council designation of three
<br>Kuwaitis -- Hamed Al-Ali, Jaber Al-Jalahmah and Mubarak
<br>Al-Bathali-- as terrorist facilitators and inciters has
<br>remained relatively subdued with the exception of defiant
<br>statements from the designees (Ref D) and now statements by
<br>Kuwaiti Members of Parliament (MP) Dr. Walid Al-Tabtaba'i,
<br>Khudair Al-Enezi and Abdullah Akash. Their comments appeared
<br>in the January 20 internet version of the Arabic-language
<br>newspaper Al-Rai Al-Amm and on January 30 in the
<br>Arabic-language newspapers Al-Qabas and Al-Wasat. The MPs
<br>criticize "the terrorist policy of the US" and condemn the
<br>addition of the three Kuwaitis to the blacklist of terrorist
<br>financiers by the UNSC. Two of the designees, Al-Ali and
<br>Al-Bathali continue to blast the airwaves with interviews,
<br>claiming their innocence and criticizing U.S. policy and the
<br>UNSC decisions to designate them. The three vocal MPs are
<br>all Islamists and are regular grandstanders in criticizing
<br>U.S. policy on a host of regional issues. End Summary.
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) In an interview appearing January 20 in the
<br>Arabic-language newspaper Al-Rai Al-Amm, titled
<br>"Al-Tabtaba'i Asks the Government to Object to the
<br>International Resolution Against Three Kuwaitis," Dr. Walid
<br>Al-Tabtaba'i, MP, informed Al-Rai of his intentions to
<br>discuss the UNSC resolution with Minister of Foreign Affairs
<br>Shaykh Dr. Mohammad Al Sabah. Al-Tabtaba'i told Al-Rai that
<br>the government must object to the "unjust and unfounded
<br>resolution," and pointed out that it is unacceptable to
<br>accuse people without irrefutable proof. MP Akash accused
<br>the U.S. of engaging in terrorism through its accusation of
<br>innocent people without possessing irrefutable proof to
<br>condemn them, stating, "America practices terrorism against
<br>whoever disagrees with her, although she is the source of
<br>terrorism." He added that he would submit a question to the
<br>Foreign Minister concerning the resolution and would inquire
<br>about the role that the government played in confronting such
<br>an "unjust" resolution, which is not based on any legal
<br>proof. He criticized the "terrorist policy of the U.S.,"
<br>calling for the government to confront the accusations it
<br>spreads against Muslims without any justification or proof.
<br>In an article appearing January 30 in the Arabic-language
<br>newspapers Al-Qabas and Al-Wasat, MP Khudair Al-Enezi
<br>condemned the addition of the names of the three Kuwaitis to
<br>the list of terrorist financiers by the UNSC and called on
<br>the GOK to exert more efforts to have their names removed.
<br>Al-Enezi stated, "It appears that all those who declare an
<br>opinion against the U.S., which is totally biased in favor of
<br>the Zionist entity (Israel), will be considered a terrorist
<br>and based on this, the Security Council should then list the
<br>names of all Arab and Muslim peoples to the blacklist." He
<br>also praised the three men, saying that they played no role
<br>in activities that breach the country's laws or encourage
<br>terrorism.
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) There has been no lull in the objections by
<br>terrorist facilitators Al-Ali and Al-Bathali. In a January
<br>28 interview appearing in the Arabic-language newspaper
<br>Al-Wasat, Al-Ali claimed he was unfairly designated and that
<br>the U.S. Treasury used false information regarding his
<br>alleged involvement in terrorist financing. In a January 27
<br>article appearing in the Arabic-language newspaper Al-Rai,
<br>Al-Bathali opens with a message to the UNSC, claiming that
<br>all reports they received were lies. Following are excerpts
<br>from Post's unofficial translation:
<br>
<br>(Begin Text)
<br>
<br>Q: What would you like us to start with?
<br>
<br>A: I would like to send a message to Richard Birth (sic),
<br>UNSC Coordinator, to say that all reports you received are
<br>lies. I have not been to Saudi Arabia for over five years.
<br>My last visit to Saudi Arabia was in February 2003. From
<br>where did you get these reports?
<br>
<br>Q: Did you violate Saudi security?
<br>A: No, I went for the Omrah (minor pilgrimage). They said
<br>that I met with leaders in Saudi and coordinated with them,
<br>
<br>Kuwait 00000128 002 of 003
<br>
<br>
<br>but this is false.
<br>
<br>Q: You mean with the outlaws in Saudi?
<br>A: Yes, Al-Qaeda. I was in jail after the Omrah for six
<br>months, but I did not meet anybody. I did not have money and
<br>I did not hand over money to anybody. They took me directly
<br>from the Jeddah Airport to jail. With whom then did I meet?
<br>These reports are lies and I do not want the UNSC Coordinator
<br>to be like a puppet following the instructions of other
<br>countries or certain people.
<br>
<br>Q: Have the sanctions affected you?
<br>A: Yes, I have been gone without a salary for 11 months and
<br>the GOK is not helping me. I need my salary. It is not an
<br>asset to freeze. They have no right to freeze it. It is for
<br>me and my children. I cannot get money without working.
<br>
<br>Q: Are you still working?
<br>A: Yes, at Kuwait Municipality.
<br>
<br>Q: Is your salary being transferred to the Bank?
<br>A: Yes, Kuwait Finance House. But, my account is frozen.
<br>
<br>Q: Since you are in debt, does the "Jihad movement" pay you?
<br>A: No one pays me. I am like the Gaza Strip in Kuwait.
<br>
<br>Q: But you do not deny you participated in Jihad in Bosnia?
<br>A: Yes, and I was honored. Jihad is mandatory for all
<br>Muslims.
<br>
<br>Q: The UNSC does not believe in that.
<br>A: We follow God's law. We have nothing to do with the UNSC
<br>or international law.
<br>
<br>Q: You do not think you did anything against the law?
<br>A: I did nothing against the law.
<br>
<br>Q: You did not go to Afghanistan?
<br>A: No, I did not go there.
<br>
<br>Q: What about Iraq?
<br>A: No.
<br>
<br>Q: In Bosnia, Muslims were being killed and you believe
<br>there was a reason to defend them?
<br>A: Also in Iraq and Afghanistan.
<br>
<br>Q: What about Palestine?
<br>A: Jihadis were there since Abdulla Azzam. But, Palestine
<br>is being guarded very strictly and no one can penetrate it.
<br>
<br>Q: Who are these guards?
<br>A: Neighboring countries. Now Egypt has opened its borders,
<br>I hope they can manage to penetrate.
<br>
<br>Q: Does Islam call for a truce like what happened with
<br>Saladin?
<br>A: Saladin made a truce while he was in power.
<br>
<br>Q: Who won in Lebanon in 2006?
<br>A: It was the resistance, Jihadis, Hizbullah, and Sunnis
<br>with them. There is a battalion of Sunnis and Druze and even
<br>Christians. All together.
<br>
<br>Q: This has never been published or shown through the media.
<br>A: We have nothing to do with the media. But it is well
<br>known. Why did that Army surround Naher al-Barid Refugee
<br>Camp? Why did they not fight Israel?
<br>
<br>Q: They say that you went to Kosovo?
<br>A: Yes, I was the only Kuwaiti there. We should help our
<br>Muslim brothers everywhere. The time that Iraq invaded our
<br>country we asked the whole world to help us. Why is it
<br>strange now to help each other?
<br>
<br>Q: Many people think that you are dragging the youth into
<br>trouble without reason.
<br>A: We see victory so close. The Americans are in trouble in
<br>Iraq. They are in a quagmire. Is that not a victory?
<br>
<br>Q: You think the West is screaming in Afghanistan?
<br>A: Yes I do.
<br>
<br>Q: Is it true that Al-Qaeda's activity has been limited
<br>there?
<br>A: American military leaders say that Afghanistan is a
<br>difficult situation. This means it is a victory. Al-Qaeda's
<br>recruitment is growing. In every house there is someone who
<br>
<br>Kuwait 00000128 003 of 003
<br>
<br>
<br>supports Al-Qaeda.
<br>
<br>Q: Where are they?
<br>A: Everywhere, in Kuwait and other countries. Is that not a
<br>victory?
<br>
<br>Q: Victory comes by making a truce and peace.
<br>A: The one in power does not make a truce or peace with the
<br>feeble. Shall we let them go on attacking the Muslims?
<br>
<br>Q: If this is your position, why do you find it strange that
<br>they punish you?
<br>A: We are talking about my salary, my earnings, my food and
<br>drink. My monthly salary is KD 300 (USD 1100), does that
<br>defeat America in Iraq? They paid USD 400 billion in Iraq!
<br>
<br>Q: I meant do you expect them to show you mercy?
<br>A: Kuwait is an independent country and has sovereignty
<br>
<br>Q: Would you like to say anything else?
<br>A: I hope they intervene to unfreeze my salary before I find
<br>myself forced to go according to Hadith (prophetic
<br>tradition); whoever dies defending his honor or money, he is
<br>a martyr. Please do not force me to do so. I tried my best
<br>to get back my salary, but without success.

<br>Comment
<br>--------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) The three designees continue to try to use the media
<br>-- with limited success -- to gain sympathetic advantage with
<br>the Kuwaiti audience and to try to exploit their roles as
<br>"victims" of the USG war on terror. We have also noticed a
<br>degree of discomfort with the designations within the MFA:
<br>
<br>--xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>glossed over the TF charges against the three and showed more
<br>concern over the financial plight of the families of the
<br>designees (ref E).
<br>
<br>--xxxxxxxxxxxx was indignant that three Kuwaitis would be
<br>targeted in such a manner, and was convinced that there was
<br>not enough evidence to support the UN's claims (ref B).
<br>
<br>¶5. (C)xxxxxxxxxxxx (who plays a largely behind the scenes role in the
<br>Kuwaiti political scene), told poloff that these three
<br>individuals are guilty of TF and deserve the imposition of
<br>sanctions. He added, though, that the GOK does "not know
<br>how" to proceed with the UNSCR 1267 sanction mandates and is
<br>secretly content to allow the negative attention on the USG
<br>
<br>Sipdis
<br>to continue while it sorts out the Kuwaiti role and
<br>responsibility in the matter. We are continuing to press the
<br>GOK for strict adherence to their international obligations
<br>and will report results septel.
