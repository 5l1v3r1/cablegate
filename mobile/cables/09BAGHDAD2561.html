<br>SUBJECT: THE GREAT GAME, IN MESOPOTAMIA: IRAQ AND ITS 
<br>NEIGHBORS, PART II 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Christopher R. Hill, for reasons 1.4 b and d. 
<br>
<br>
<br>¶1. (U) This is the second of two cables reviewing Iraq's 
<br>relations with key neighboring countries. this cable focuses 
<br>on Iraq's relations with Syria, in the wake of the August 19 
<br>bombings. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Summary: Iraq's improving relations with its 
<br>neighbors in 2008 and early 2009 represented a critical 
<br>element in its efforts to maintain security and stability and 
<br>normalize its position in the Gulf and the broader region. 
<br>The August 19 bombings -- targeting the MFA, and by extension 
<br>Iraq's improving relations with its neighbors -- represent a 
<br>serious setback and have alarmed senior Iraqi officials, 
<br>suggesting that Iraqi Sunni Arab neighbors in particular now 
<br>view those earlier gains as "reversible." These fears help 
<br>explain the rapid deterioration in relations with Syria and 
<br>the GOI's demand that the UN intervene to investigate the 
<br>August 19 bombings, so as to put Syria on notice that the 
<br>international community is scrutinizing its use of Iraqi 
<br>Ba'athist proxies to interfere in Iraq. Iraq's relations 
<br>Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran and Turkey are covered in Part I 
<br>of this message. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>PROGRESS WITH THE NEIGHBORS, 2008-09 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) From 2008 through much of the summer, Iraq's 
<br>relations with its neighbors were on a positive trajectory 
<br>overall. The breakthroughs in regional engagement began in 
<br>the fall of 2008 (following sustained USG pressure), with the 
<br>UAE, Bahrain, and Kuwait all sending ambassadors to Baghdad, 
<br>along with Jordan, the Arab League, and Syria. Iraq also 
<br>began its regular participation in the GCC 3 in 2008. While 
<br>there was less formal movement in 2009, the positive trend 
<br>continued, as the GOI named 58 new ambassadors and the 
<br>Egyptian government took steps to return its ambassador. The 
<br>continuing signs of improvement in security in Iraq in 2008 
<br>and the first half of 2009 provided a growing sense that Iraq 
<br>was becoming a much more secure place and getting strong 
<br>enough to ward off, or at least better control, neighbors' 
<br>meddling in its internal affairs. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) However, not all the trendlines were positive during 
<br>this period. Despite pressure from us, the Saudis refused to 
<br>send an ambassador (although they received Iraq's ambassador 
<br>in Riyadh), reflecting Riyadh's and King Abdullah's, in 
<br>particular, deep-seated doubts about a Shia-led democracy in 
<br>Iraq. Relations with other key countries in the region, 
<br>including Syria, Kuwait, and even Turkey, also experienced 
<br>varying degrees of drag on positive movement, ranging from 
<br>foreign fighters issues in Syria to Chapter VII issues in 
<br>Kuwait and water shortfalls from Turkey. The perception 
<br>among many Iraqis during this period was that despite the 
<br>gains in normalization and regional integration, Iraq was a 
<br>pitiful (former) regional giant, preyed upon and held back in 
<br>various ways by neighbors intent on keeping it weak and 
<br>taking advantage of it. 
<br>
<br>AUGUST 19: A THREAT TO NORMALIZATION TRENDS 
<br>------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) The August 19 bombings which severely damaged the MFA 
<br>and the Ministry of Finance buildings and Baghdad's 
<br>residents' sense of improving security, brought these 
<br>negative trendlines into sharp relief. The bombings undercut 
<br>the perception of normalization that had become a commonplace 
<br>over the past eighteen months (and undercut PM Maliki's 
<br>platform of having delivered on security). Iraqis, both 
<br>official and unofficial, believe it was no accident that one 
<br>of the main targets, and the one that suffered the most 
<br>Qof the main targets, and the one that suffered the most 
<br>damage, is the MFA, symbol of Iraq's efforts to build 
<br>relations with its neighbors and normalize its position in 
<br>the region. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) In the immediate aftermath of the bombings, FM Zebari 
<br>made accusations that one or more of the neighboring 
<br>countries had conspired with al-Qaeda, possibly using 
<br>proxies, to support the bombings. In a meeting with the 
<br>Ambassador, PM Maliki referred to a "momentum of 
<br>interference" that was building in the lead-up to the January 
<br>national elections. Zebari described the next 5-6 month 
<br>time-frame as "a period of maximum danger" for Iraq. The 
<br>bombings were meant to convey the perception -- welcomed by 
<br>some neighbors, he insisted -- that the security and 
<br>normalization in Iraq of the past two years were "reversible." 
<br>
<br>DO THE NEIGHBORS HAVE IT IN FOR IRAQ? 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Iraqi contacts speculated that regional unease about 
<br>
<br>BAGHDAD 00002561 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>a Shia-led Iraqi government, and about the democratic 
<br>character of that government, a model that could eventually 
<br>undermine the legitimacy of more autocratic regimes in the 
<br>region, helped explain why some neighbors would prefer a weak 
<br>and unstable Iraq, where security and political gains of the 
<br>past two years are rolled back. Acting NSC Advisor Dr. Safa 
<br>al-Sheikh described the neighbors as bent on intervening in 
<br>Iraq, especially in the months leading up to the January 2010 
<br>elections. While some used proxies to foment violence, 
<br>others restricted themselves to money, media (propaganda), 
<br>and meddling, all designed to help shape electoral 
<br>coalitions, and block or further individual political 
<br>careers, in order to better control Iraq and keep it weak, 
<br>politically fractured, and pliable, insisted al-Sheikh. PM 
<br>Maliki told the Ambassador that neighbors feared a resurgent 
<br>Iraq that would capture too much of "the limelight." 
<br>According to Maliki, neighbors also feared Iraq's "golden 
<br>connection between Shia and Sunni Islam," a legacy that gives 
<br>Iraq special precedence in the region. His argument is based 
<br>on a well-acknowledged fact that Iraq is the grand junction 
<br>of Shia and Sunni Islam as well as of the Arab world and 
<br>Persia, making it, therefore, both strategically vital but 
<br>also vulnerable. The view of key contacts here is that some 
<br>of Iraq's Sunni Arab neighbors have concluded that in a 
<br>stable, peaceful Iraqi democracy, Sunni political power in 
<br>Iraq would be finished. These Arab neighbors, therefore, 
<br>conclude that the only way the Sunnis will ever come back 
<br>into power in Iraq is in the wake of a period of sustained 
<br>instability and violence that de-legitimizes democratic 
<br>governance and the Shia as Iraqi political leaders. 
<br>
<br>RELATIONS WITH SYRIA IN CRISIS 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Relations with Syria suffered the most precipitous 
<br>decline in the wake of the attacks, with mutual recalls of 
<br>Ambassadors and public statements making clear the GOI felt 
<br>Syria was complicit. While Syrian support for Iraqi 
<br>Ba'athists has long been a significant bilateral irritant, 
<br>the GOI's public claim that Syrian-based insurgents were 
<br>responsible for August 19 represented a significant shift. 
<br>To the al-Maliki government, the problem was now seen as an 
<br>existential threat to the state and the GOI could no longer 
<br>treat the issue with routine diplomacy, especially given 
<br>fears these attacks were only the first wave. According to 
<br>Maliki and al-Sheikh, senior Iraqi security officers had seen 
<br>a growing body of intelligence in the months leading up to 
<br>attacks indicating significant cooperation between Iraqi 
<br>Ba'athists and al-Qaeda, although Sheikh acknowledged that 
<br>the proof for Iraqi Ba'athist involvement in the August 19 
<br>bombings had been assembled "somewhat quickly." He explained 
<br>that at the cell level, Ba'athists participate with some 
<br>al-Qaida groups -- usually disguising their Baathist 
<br>sympathies -- and often dominate the local groups because 
<br>they have highly prized skills such as experience handling 
<br>weapons and explosives. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Iraqi officials make clear that despite the current 
<br>problems with Syria, they foresee the possibility of improved 
<br>relations in the future. PM Maliki recently stated that Iraq 
<br>wanted a harder-line USG policy toward Syria only to the 
<br>extent it would help compel Syria to stop misbehaving and be 
<br>a better neighbor. The problem, according to Maliki and 
<br>others, is that Syria is a neighborhood menace with a history 
<br>of fomenting violence and inciting instability in the region 
<br>-- and it viewed these tactics as part of the standard tools 
<br>Q-- and it viewed these tactics as part of the standard tools 
<br>of diplomacy. Iraq's problem is that it is too weak on its 
<br>own to intimidate Syria into behaving. With no troops "to 
<br>mass on the border" as a threat, as Turkey had once done, and 
<br>taking his cue from Lebanon's experience following the Hariri 
<br>assassination, Maliki felt he had no recourse but to take the 
<br>issue to the UNSC, hoping this diplomatic "stick" might 
<br>persuade Bashar and his regime to back off. Iraq is looking 
<br>to the United States and other members of the P-5 to endorse 
<br>the appointment by the UNSYG of a senior official to 
<br>investigate the August 19 bombings and external support for 
<br>terrorism in Iraq. (NOTE: Not all Iraqi officials agreed 
<br>with the PM's approach. On September 5, Iraq's three 
<br>presidents -- Talabani, Hashimi and Abd al-Mahdi -- issued a 
<br>statement calling for containing tension between Iraq and 
<br>Syria through diplomatic channels, an obvious rejection of 
<br>Maliki's insistence on UN involvement. END NOTE.)
