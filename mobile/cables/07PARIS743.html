<br>Classified By: Political Minister-Counselor Josiah Rosenblatt for reaso

<br> 
<br>Summary 
<br> ------- 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C)  During a meeting with Codel Tanner on February 22, 
<br>French MFA Political Director Gerard Araud reviewed the 
<br>current state of the bilateral relationship, commented on 
<br>NATO's continuing purpose, and compared France's and 
<br>Britain's historically distinct orientations towards the U.S. 
<br> He also discussed Afghanistan and Iran, two outstanding 
<br>cases of U.S.-French cooperation.  On Afghanistan, Araud 
<br>highlighted France's continued participation in NATO 
<br>operations, but called for a more explicitly defined 
<br>"political strategy" for reaching a desired end-state.  On 
<br>Iran, he emphasized the need for continuing pressure on Iran, 
<br>through P-5 unity, which is impacting on Ahmadinejad's 
<br>weakened position, and which offers the only hope for a 
<br>negotiated outcome.  End Summary. 
<br> 
<br>NATO's Purpose 
<br>--------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (C) MFA Political Director Gerard Araud hosted Codel 
<br>Tanner, in Paris for the annual discussions of the NATO 
<br>Parliamentary Assembly (NPA) Economic Committee with the 
<br>OECD, to a meeting and luncheon on February 22.  Ambassadors 
<br>Stapleton and Morella also attended.  Both sides saluted the 
<br>historical links and continuing cultural and economic ties 
<br>between the U.S. and France, along with our wide-ranging 
<br>diplomatic cooperation.  Araud took the opportunity of the 
<br>visit of the U.S. members of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly 
<br>to offer, in his typically plain-spoken fashion, a thumb-nail 
<br>history of U.S.-French relations since World War II, 
<br>including our different approaches to NATO.  Recalling an 
<br>Cold War bromide, Araud said that NATO's original purpose had 
<br>been "to keep the Germans down, the Russians out, and the 
<br>Americans in."  Its current purpose is -- for the newer 
<br>central European and Baltic members, given their fear of 
<br>Russia, "rational or not" -- to keep the Americans in.    For 
<br>other members, NATO provides a way to meet their defense -- 
<br>without having to pay for it.  Araud decried the abysmally 
<br>low defense spending by the European allies.  Among the 
<br>Europeans, only the French and the British come close to 
<br>carrying their weight, an exception which can be explained by 
<br>their history as global powers, and their residual desire to 
<br>exert influence. 
<br> 
<br>Trans-Atlantic Ties:  The Cases of Britain, France and Germany 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C) Taking up this theme, Araud offered the Codel a 
<br>historical disquisition on the differences between France's 
<br>and Britain's post-war relationship with the U.S.  Britain, 
<br>for its part, tries to "ride the tiger," influencing U.S. 
<br>policy behind the scenes.  This is what they have tried to do 
<br>on Iraq:  "With what success, we might ask?"  France, on the 
<br>other hand, tries to defend its interests, "tries to exist 
<br>(as an independent player)."  The U.S. often views this 
<br>simply as opposition, or anti-Americanism, which it isn't: 
<br>"We're trying to exist, and to exercise our right to have our 
<br>own opinion, including on how to address international 
<br>crises.  That means that we may agree in some cases -- as on 
<br>Iran where we work extremely closely, coordinating daily.  In 
<br>others, as in Iraq, we disagreed, and still do.  This is not 
<br>anti-Americanism, it's France developing its own analyses and 
<br>exercising its own policy."  Stepping back, Araud recalled 
<br>that the 1956 Suez Crisis had marked the end of both France 
<br>and the UK's great power aspirations. Each, however, drew a 
<br>different lesson from their joint failure.  U.S. opposition 
<br>to the Suez operation, (which together with the Soviet 
<br>Union's threat to use nuclear weapons had scuttled the 
<br>Anglo-French operation), had led the British to conclude that 
<br>"nothing was possible without the Americans," and that their 
<br>influence would have to be applied through the U.S., by being 
<br>at its side, and having its voice heard as America's most 
<br>trusted ally.  The French took a distinctly different course, 
<br>that of autonomy and independence (as symbolized in its 
<br>decision, a few months after Suez, to create its own nuclear 
<br>force).  Germany was a case apart, for historical reasons. 
<br>With a military that was totally integrated into NATO, it was 
<br>America's model ally.  Now things are changing: for the first 
<br>time since WW II, during the Iraq crisis, Germany opposed the 
<br>U.S.  While the British and French conception of their own 
<br>roles -- "the special relationship" and 
<br>independence/autonomy, respectively -- still apply, Germany's 
<br>is now a question mark. 
<br> 
<br>Afghanistan 
<br>-----------

<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) In the back and forth that followed Araud's 
<br>presentation, Ambassador Stapleton noted that we describe the 
<br>current state of the relationship as "normal," a 
<br>characterization which Araud's historical synopsis supported. 
<br> It's a relationship we value, said the Ambassador; and we 
<br>certainly do not take the French for granted.  Rep John 
<br>Tanner (D-TN) agreed on the value of a diversity of opinion. 
<br>Reaffirming strong U.S. support for NATO, he pointed to 
<br>Afghanistan as the Alliance's defining issue.  The U.S. 
<br>appreciates France's support in this crucial battle. 
<br>Congressman Paul Gillmor (R-OH), Vice-President of the NPA, 
<br>noted the importance of the NATO to the U.S, France's 
<br>commitment of resources to defense, and the commonality of 
<br>interests in our joint effort in Afghanistan.  (NOTE: 
<br>Congressmen Tanner and Gillmor earlier met with French 
<br>television  and print media to push for strengthened Allied 
<br>support in Afghanistan. END NOTE.)  Araud agreed, citing the 
<br>recent dispatch of the French aircraft carrier Charles de 
<br>Gaulle to the region, which will allow France to increase its 
<br>participation in airstrikes in Afghanistan.  However, 
<br>France's concern is lack of a "political strategy" concerning 
<br>Afghanistan, a point Chirac tried to make at the Riga Summit. 
<br> Perhaps France's proposed Contact Group wasn't the right 
<br>solution, said Araud, as it raises the question of 
<br>neighboring countries' roles, and Afghanistan's as well.  But 
<br>at the end of the day, success in Afghanistan will be 
<br>political, "and we are simply not convinced we have a 
<br>political strategy, an end-game in view, a roadmap to 
<br>success.  If what we are doing simply amounts to killing 
<br>Taliban every Spring, some of us, five years from now, will 
<br>have tired of this.  That's our concern; we're not 
<br>criticizing NATO, which is doing it's job.  It's the 
<br>political strategy that's missing.  For example, Iran is a 
<br>natural ally in the fight against the Taliban.  And there is 
<br>the drug problem, which affects you, us and Russia.  We're 
<br>concerned about where we're going." 
<br> 
<br>Iran 
<br>---- 
<br>¶5. (C) Responding to Congressman Dennis Moore's (D-KS) 
<br>question about the French view of Iran, Araud underlined how 
<br>closely the U.S. and France have been working together over 
<br>the past four years.  He distinguished Iran from North Korea, 
<br>"a criminal regime which doesn't care about the suffering of 
<br>its people."  Iran, on the other hand, is a "sort of 
<br>democracy," a proud country, where public opinion counts for 
<br>something, and which doesn't want to be seen as a pariah 
<br>state.  This complex reality calls for a dual policy:  a 
<br>readiness to negotiate, but in a context of international 
<br>pressure.  During the negotiation of UNSCR 1737 a difference 
<br>opened up between the U.S. and the EU-3, said Araud, with the 
<br>U.S. seeking a stronger text, while the Europeans insisted on 
<br>one that could be supported by the P-5.  Araud contended that 
<br>now the U.S. agrees, retrospectively, that the Europeans were 
<br>right on insisting on a unanimous outcome, one that could not 
<br>be interpreted as the West ganging up on Iran.  UNSC 
<br>unanimity (and especially China's vote) sent a powerful 
<br>message of Iran's isolation, impacting strongly on Iranian 
<br>public opinion.  Araud admitted that "mercantile" factors 
<br>were driving some, especially the Russians.  While the French 
<br>Treasury "is furious" about U.S. warnings to European banks 
<br>about their operations with Iran, said Araud, those efforts 
<br>work -- they're very effective.  Araud commented that the 
<br>U.S. military option is taken very seriously in Iran.  As 
<br>recounted to him by well-known French journalist Bernard 
<br>Guetta, who recently returned from Tehran, "the Iranians are 
<br>terrified; they take the U.S. military threat seriously -- 
<br>people don't want it."  Another important factor is 
<br>Ahmadinejad's growing weakness.  "He was elected because he 
<br>wasn't corrupt, he promised housing and good administration, 
<br>but he hasn't delivered.  And there was his recent defeat in 
<br>the municipal elections.  That said, although the music has 
<br>changed, the words haven't":  The Iranians continue to refuse 
<br>to suspend enrichment.  Therefore we must keep up the 
<br>pressure.  And the pressure is working.  So now we must work 
<br>on a second sanctions resolution, and keep the door open to a 
<br>"double suspension" deal with Iran.  We haven't failed, 
<br>emphasized Araud.  According to Guetta, he said, many people 
<br>close to Supreme Leader Khamenei had "incredibly violent 
<br>things to say about Ahmadinejad whom they regard as an 
<br>upstart.  They want him out.  The subdued celebration of 
<br>Revolution Day, including Ahmadinejad's speech, in which he 
<br>did not mention the Holocaust, was significant.  Araud also 
<br>pointed to a recent press interview with Velayati in which he 
<br>affirmed that the Holocaust was a historical reality.  We 
<br>have two to three years, concluded Araud, to work on this 
<br>before Iran gets the bomb.  We will and must continue to work 
<br>on this together -- including with the Russians and Chinese.

<br>this cable before departing Paris.
