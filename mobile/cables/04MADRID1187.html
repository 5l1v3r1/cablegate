<br>PRESSURES FOR WITHDRAWAL 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Charge J. Robert Manzanares per 1.5 (b) and (d). 
<br>
<br>Summary 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Political pressure is high on incoming Socialist 
<br>President Rodriguez Zapatero to fulfill his campaign promise 
<br>to pull the 1300 Spanish troops out of Iraq absent a new UN 
<br>mandate giving the UN the lead role. Zapatero is on the hook 
<br>to demonstrate to his supporters that his surprise election 
<br>March 14 ushered in a significant change from the Aznar 
<br>years. Zapatero, who vehemently opposed the Iraq war, has 
<br>repeatedly emphasized, publicly and privately, that he will 
<br>comply with his campaign promises. The clearest way to 
<br>manifest this would be to pull the troops out. Nonetheless, 
<br>the Socialists are sensitive to charges a Spanish withdrawal 
<br>following the March 11 Madrid terror attacks would appear to 
<br>be cutting and running in the face of terror. A new UNSCR 
<br>giving the UN a lead role might provide Zapatero with cover 
<br>to keep the troops in, but what exactly Zapatero can accept 
<br>remains vague since he has not defined it. We expect him to 
<br>take his cues from France and Germany. Public opinion in 
<br>the wake of March 11 regards Spain as being in the line of 
<br>Jihadist fire because of the Aznar government's Iraq policy 
<br>and favors withdrawal. Recent fighting in Najaf between 
<br>Spanish forces and Shiite extremists has heightened concerns 
<br>about the Iraq deployment. Significant Spanish losses there 
<br>could clinch the decision to pull out. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>The Case for Withdrawal 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Zapatero has been vehemently against the Iraq war 
<br>from the beginning. He has consistently maintained that the 
<br>war was founded on lies, and is immoral and illegal. Many 
<br>of the 11 million Spaniards who voted for the Socialists on 
<br>March 14 share his view. Many Socialists, especially those 
<br>on the left, want the troops out now regardless of a UN 
<br>resolution. As far as Spanish opinion as a whole, according 
<br>to a radio (Cadena Ser) poll last week, 38% of respondents 
<br>favored Spanish troops staying in Iraq if there were a new UN 
<br>mandate while 42% favor pulling the troops out even if the UN 
<br>takes control of Iraq. Only a small percentage favor the 
<br>troops staying under the current mandate. Many Socialists 
<br>are uncomfortable with the assertive international role for 
<br>Spain that Aznar espoused and, since the March 11 attacks, 
<br>believe Aznar's alliance with the US put Spain in the direct 
<br>line of fire for Islamist terrorists. 
<br>
<br>Caving in to Terrorists? 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) The Socialists are, however, sensitive to the charge 
<br>that withdrawal from Iraq means caving in to terrorist 
<br>blackmail following March 11. They note that Zapatero's 
<br>pledge to withdraw long predated March 11 (though the 
<br>Socialists would not have been elected had the March 11 
<br>attacks not taken place). Jose Blanco, Socialist Party 
<br>National Coordinator, noted on April 6: "Let's not mix apples 
<br>and oranges. One thing is terrorism which has to be fought 
<br>on all fronts. Another thing is our politics concerning the 
<br>war in Iraq. Politically we shouldn't link one thing with 
<br>the other." Popular sentiment, however, does link them. 
<br>Many believe Spain is now exposed to jihadist terrorism as a 
<br>result of a military deployment in Iraq that most Spaniards 
<br>oppose. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Antiterrorism marchers numbering 25,000 turned out 
<br>April 5 in Leganes, the site of the April 3 shootout and 
<br>suicide of the suspected leaders of the March 11 Madrid 
<br>terror attacks. The march underlined that many Spaniards do 
<br>link the March 11 terror attacks to Spain's presence in Iraq. 
<br>The communique for the march, at the urging of the Socialist 
<br>mayor of Leganes, included an explicit call for Spain to 
<br>withdraw its troops from Iraq. (This prompted Aznar's 
<br>Popular Party to boycott the march and organize its own on 
<br>April 6). The message that came out of the April 5 rally 
<br>was that since Spaniards never wanted to be in Iraq in the 
<br>first place, Spain should withdraw, lower its profile, and 
<br>thereby remove itself as a target. Images of the Shiite 
<br>riots in Najaf and elsewhere further agitated Spanish opinion 
<br>against Spain's presence in Iraq, as did reports that Spanish 
<br>troops returned fire on rioters in Najaf April 4, killing 
<br>about 20. 
<br>
<br>UN Resolution Giving UN a Lead Role 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) FM designate Moratinos has been in the lead in 
<br>holding up the possibility that a new UNSCR giving the UN the 
<br>leading role in the Iraq could satisfy Zapatero's electoral 
<br>pledge. However, Zapatero and his key political advisors 
<br>such as Jose Blanco and Jesus Caldera, have been less forward 
<br>leaning than Moratinos. The posture of France and Germany 
<br>on a new resolution should be important, since Zapatero has 
<br>made it clear that he wants to follow their lead. If France 
<br>and Germany are on board, Zapatero will feel pressure to 
<br>follow suit. One prominent commentator, well connected in 
<br>the PSOE, noted to us that if, for example, France were 
<br>willing to commit troops to Iraq under a new UNSCR, Zapatero 
<br>would be able to show that the situation had fundamentally 
<br>changed and keep Spanish troops there. 
<br>
<br>Comment 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Indications are that Zapatero has not made a final 
<br>decision on what to do about the troops. The "pull the 
<br>troops out" sentiment from his base, and which his key 
<br>political advisors share, will be a critical factor weighing 
<br>on him. For Zapatero, the easiest scenario would be no new 
<br>UN resolution, which would mean he would have no choice but 
<br>to pull the troops out. A UN resolution expanding the UN 
<br>role will force him to make a choice. In this case, 
<br>Zapatero's allies in the all important Prisa media group 
<br>might be able to help him sell the line that he had won by 
<br>successfully pushing for an increased UN role and give him 
<br>cover to keep the troops in. Zapatero may also be 
<br>susceptible to the argument that, whatever the rationale or 
<br>lack thereof for the war, undercutting the coalition now 
<br>could prove disastrous. Nonetheless, escalation of fighting 
<br>in Southern Iraq, particularly if Spanish forces suffer 
<br>significant losses, may clinch the decision in favor of 
<br>withdrawal.
