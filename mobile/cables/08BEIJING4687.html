<br>
<br>Summary 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) China is "gravely concerned" by statements that the 
<br>United States is considering transferring PRC citizen Uighurs 
<br>detained at Guantanamo to a third country rather than 
<br>repatriating them to China, Assistant Foreign Minister Liu 
<br>Jieyi told the Ambassador December 29. The Uighur detainees 
<br>are members of a UN-listed terrorist organization, the East 
<br>Turkestan Islamic Movement, and as such should be given to 
<br>China to be dealt with under Chinese law, he said. The 
<br>United States should not allow Taiwan Legislative Yuan 
<br>President Wang Jyng-ping to lead an "official delegation" to 
<br>the United States for the upcoming U.S. presidential 
<br>inauguration, Liu said. The Ambassador responded that the 
<br>administration is not inviting delegations from abroad, but 
<br>rather only representatives of the Washington-based 
<br>diplomatic corps, to the inauguration. The Ambassador raised 
<br>concerns regarding the continued detention of Charter 08 
<br>signer and organizer Liu Xiaobo and urged the Chinese 
<br>Government to release him and stop harassing peaceful 
<br>dissidents. Liu responded that the issue of Liu Xiaobo is 
<br>one of rule of law rather than of human rights, and that the 
<br>case is being dealt with in keeping with Chinese law. End 
<br>Summary. 
<br>
<br>"Chinese Uighur Terrorists in Guantanamo" 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Assistant Foreign Minister Liu Jieyi called the 
<br>Ambassador into the Foreign Ministry December 29 to 
<br>officially record China's "grave concern" over the State 
<br>Department spokesperson's December 23 statements that 
<br>repatriating Chinese Uighurs held in Guantanamo to China 
<br>would not be prudent and furthermore that the USG appreciates 
<br>the consideration given by Germany, Portugal, France, 
<br>Switzerland and other European states to accepting these 
<br>individuals. The suspects are members of the East Turkestan 
<br>Islamic Movement (ETIM), a group listed by the UN Security 
<br>Council (UNSC) Resolution 1267 committee as a terrorist 
<br>organization, AFM Liu alleged. Furthermore, the U.S. 
<br>Department of Justice has indicated that the suspects 
<br>acknowledged in interviews that, when captured, they were in 
<br>Afghanistan for weapons training to fight the Chinese 
<br>Government. As such, the Uighur detainees should be returned 
<br>to China "as a matter of course" so that they can be dealt 
<br>with in keeping with Chinese law. Transferring them to a 
<br>third country would violate the relevant UNSC resolutions, 
<br>would not be in keeping with the United States' international 
<br>commitments, would harm China's judicial sovereignty and 
<br>national security, and could end up being a risk to U.S. 
<br>security as terrorists sometimes turn their focus from one 
<br>nation to another, Liu said. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) China believes U.S.-China counter-terrorism 
<br>cooperation should be based on reciprocity and mutual benefit 
<br>and therefore opposes transferring the Uighur detainees to a 
<br>third country. Noting that Sino-U.S. relations are at an 
<br>important "moment of transition," he urged the United States 
<br>to consider overall bilateral relations, our common 
<br>counter-terrorism interests and the "utmost sensitivity" of 
<br>the issue and repatriate the individuals to China. Doing so 
<br>would avoid harm to bilateral relations and to cooperation 
<br>"in important areas." AFM Liu also urged the USG to advise 
<br>the incoming administration of the importance of this issue. 
<br>The Ambassador took note of PRC concerns. 
<br>
<br>Taiwan Inauguration Delegation 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) China is "extremely concerned" by reports in the 
<br>Taiwan press that Taiwan's "so-called" Legislative Yuan 
<br>President Wang Jyng-ping will "lead an official delegation" 
<br>to the United States for the January 20 inauguration, Liu 
<br>said. Furthermore, the delegation may include opposition 
<br>party DPP representative Annette Lu, whom he described as 
<br>"bent on Taiwanese independence." Noting that Taiwan is the 
<br>most sensitive issue in Sino-U.S. relations and that China's 
<br>one-China principle "cannot change," Liu said that China 
<br>firmly opposes official exchanges between the United States 
<br>and Taiwan. As the inauguration is an important and official 
<br>event, participation by the delegation and Annette Lu would 
<br>
<br>BEIJING 00004687 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>be a serious violation of the One China policy and the three 
<br>Joint Communiques, would "send a seriously wrong signal" to 
<br>Taiwan independence forces, and would interfere with 
<br>bilateral and cross-Strait relations, Liu said. He urged the 
<br>United States to recognize the sensitivity and complexity of 
<br>the Taiwan issue and not allow the delegation or Annette Lu 
<br>or other "independence characters" to attend, nor to conduct 
<br>any official U.S.-Taiwan exchanges, and to advise the 
<br>incoming administration and Congress of the sensitivity of 
<br>the issue. Liu added that the United States should guard 
<br>against allowing Wang and the delegation to travel to the 
<br>United States and to characterize the trip as "official." 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) The Ambassador responded that while representatives of 
<br>the Washington-based diplomatic corps are invited to the 
<br>inauguration, no delegations are invited from abroad. As 
<br>such, there are no "official" foreign delegations attending 
<br>at the invitation of the Administration. 
<br>
<br>Human Rights: Charter 08 and Liu Xiaobo 
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) The Ambassador raised U.S. concerns regarding the 
<br>continued detention of dissident writer and rights activist 
<br>Liu Xiaobo (reftel), a signer of and organizer behind the 
<br>Charter 08 democracy manifesto issued in conjunction with 
<br>international Human Rights Day December 10. The Ambassador 
<br>noted deep U.S. concern regarding reports that Chinese 
<br>citizens have been detained, interrogated and harassed as 
<br>they prepared to commemorate Human Rights Day and the 60th 
<br>anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of 
<br>Human Rights. He stressed particular concern regarding the 
<br>well-being of Liu, who remains in custody and called on the 
<br>Chinese Government to release Liu and cease harassment of all 
<br>Chinese citizens who peacefully express the desire for 
<br>internationally recognized fundamental freedoms. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) AFM Liu responded that this issue is a rule of law 
<br>issue, not a human rights issue and expressed certitude that 
<br>the case would be dealt with in accordance with PRC law. He 
<br>disagreed with the U.S. assertions as to what should be done 
<br>with Liu and any others on the grounds that the only 
<br>determinant for the correct handling of the matter will be 
<br>PRC law. Furthermore, AFM Liu stated, the Chinese Government 
<br>does not accept outside interference in China's internal 
<br>affairs.
