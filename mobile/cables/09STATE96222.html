<br>SUBJECT: (S) FRENCH FIRM SELLING INFRARED DETECTORS TO 
<br>CHINA 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: EUR/PRA Acting Deputy Director Matthew Hardiman 
<br>for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (U) This is an action request to Embassy Paris.  Please 
<br>deliver the points in paragraph 4 as soon as possible.  These 
<br>points may be left as a non-paper. 
<br> 
<br>------- 
<br>SUMMARY 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S/NF) We have information the French firm Sofradir and 
<br>its subsidiary Ulis continue to sell cooled and uncooled 
<br>infrared detectors to a Chinese firm for incorporation into 
<br>thermal imaging systems.  We believe the Chinese firm, 
<br>Zhejiang Dali Technology Company Ltd, is actively selling its 
<br>thermal imaging systems to Iranian defense entities.  Iranian 
<br>military access to Chinese thermal imaging systems that rely 
<br>on high-grade French infrared detectors could increase the 
<br>threat to US and allied forces operating in the Gulf region. 
<br>We want to request the Government of France to act 
<br>immediately to terminate this activity by Sofradir and Ulis 
<br>so China cannot use French components to manufacture weapons 
<br>systems and sell them to Iran, a state sponsor of terrorism. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>------------------------- 
<br>ACTION REQUEST/OBJECTIVES 
<br>------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S/NF) Post is requested to approach appropriate host 
<br>government officials as soon as possible to pursue the 
<br>following objectives and to deliver the talking 
<br>points/non-paper in para 4 below: 
<br> 
<br>-- Inform French officials we have information the French 
<br>firm Sofradir and its subsidiary Ulis continue to sell cooled 
<br>and uncooled infrared detectors to China's Zhejiang Dali 
<br>Technology Company Ltd for incorporation into thermal imaging 
<br>systems. 
<br> 
<br>-- Stress that Zhejiang Dali Technology is actively selling 
<br>its thermal imaging systems to Iranian defense entities and 
<br>that the use of high-grade French infrared detectors in this 
<br>technology could increase the threat to US and allied forces 
<br>operating in the Gulf region. 
<br> 
<br>-- Ask the French government to investigate, share with us 
<br>the results of its investigation, and act to have Sofradir 
<br>and Ulis immediately terminate this activity. 
<br> 
<br>-- Emphasize to French officials that infrared detectors are 
<br>critical components of high performance thermal imaging 
<br>systems and are controlled under the Wassenaar Arrangement, 
<br>Section 6.A.2.a.3. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (SECRET/REL FRANCE) BEGIN TALKING POINTS 
<br> 
<br>-- In the interest of transparency and enhanced cooperation 
<br>on nonproliferation matters, we would like to share the 
<br>following information: 
<br> 
<br>-- We have information that the French firm Sofradir and its 
<br>subsidiary Ulis continue to sell both cooled and uncooled 
<br>infrared detectors to China's Zhejiang Dali Technology 
<br>Company Ltd for incorporation into thermal imaging systems. 
<br> 
<br>-- Our information indicates the Chinese firm is actively 
<br>selling its thermal imaging systems to Iranian defense 
<br>entities. 
<br> 
<br>-- Iranian military access to Chinese thermal imaging systems 
<br>that rely on high-grade French infrared detectors could 
<br>increase the threat to US and allied forces operating in the 
<br>Gulf region. 
<br> 
<br>-- Infrared detectors (IRD) are sensors and critical 
<br>components of high performance thermal imaging systems.  IRDs 
<br>are controlled under Wassenaar Arrangement, Section 6.A.2.a.3. 
<br> 
<br>-- IRDs are used in the core assemblies for advanced 
<br>targeting pods, long-range reconnaissance systems, gimbaled 
<br>imaging systems in manned and unmanned airborne 
<br>reconnaissance and combat aircraft, Forward Looking Infrared 
<br>(FLIR) sensors, tank targeting systems, submarine periscopes, 
<br>and missile seekers. 
<br> 
<br>-- Diversion of the subject components could be harmful to 
<br>our shared national security interests.  If these IRDs were 
<br>included in the optical targeting mechanism for tanks and air 
<br>defense systems, they could potentially be used to degrade US 
<br>superiority in night combat operations. 
<br> 
<br>-- We ask that you carefully consider the consequences of 
<br>such sales. 
<br> 
<br>-- We also welcome any further information about this case 
<br>that may come to light in the course of any French 
<br>investigation into the matter. 
<br>
