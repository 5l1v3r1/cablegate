<br>
<br>Classified By: Charge D'Affaires Arnold A. Chacon for reasons 1.4 (b) a 
<br>nd (d) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C//NF) Madam Secretary, Embassy Madrid warmly welcomes 
<br>your visit, which comes on the heels of your June 24 meeting 
<br>with Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba in 
<br>Washington (Ref A). While one of the highlights of his trip 
<br>was signing the bilateral accord on Preventing and Combating 
<br>Serious Crime, one of the centerpieces of your Madrid trip 
<br>will be to sign an MOU to formalize the DHS Immigration 
<br>Advisory Program (IAP) at Madrid's Barajas Airport and a 
<br>declaration of intent for our two governments to work toward 
<br>concluding an agreement on Cooperation in Science & 
<br>Technology for Homeland Security Matters. You will hold 
<br>meetings with President Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, his 
<br>Second Vice President, Elena Salgado, who also serves as 
<br>Minister of Economy and Finance, and Interior Minister 
<br>Rubalcaba. The Embassy also will co-host a reception in your 
<br>honor, which will give you and your delegation an opportunity 
<br>to meet a range of additional senior-level officials in the 
<br>Spanish Government. Your visit will help to highlight the 
<br>importance that the USG places on the overall bilateral 
<br>relationship and the numerous programs that the DHS is 
<br>working on with our Spanish hosts. While the focus of your 
<br>trip will be on discussing bilateral issues, your 
<br>interlocutors may express GOS interest in preliminary 
<br>discussions to increase collaboration on justice and home 
<br>affairs issues during Spain's upcoming stint as President of 
<br>the European Union (EU) during the first half of 2010. 
<br>
<br>//US-SPAIN RELATIONS// 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C//NF) U.S.-Spain relations are strong and based on 
<br>shared global interests. Spain is a valued US partner and an 
<br>important geostrategic player that has achieved a remarkable 
<br>transformation since the end of the Franco dictatorship 30 
<br>years ago. It is one of the leading democracies in Europe, 
<br>and has the ninth-largest economy in the world. Spain is an 
<br>important friend and ally, and we value its cooperation 
<br>against terrorism and a range of other security issues. 
<br>Since the U.S. presidential election in November, a strong 
<br>atmosphere of goodwill has emerged in Spain for closer 
<br>bilateral cooperation. As a gesture of this goodwill, the 
<br>GOS presently is considering accepting some of the detainees 
<br>currently held at Guantanamo (GTMO, see Ref B). In 
<br>Washington, Rubalcaba publicly stated that Spain may accept 
<br>as many as five detainees. Spain is an important NATO ally, 
<br>a key player in the EU, and during January-June 2010 will 
<br>hold the EU's rotating Presidency. XXXXXXXXXXXX, judicial, and information-sharing 
<br>efforts, at least with us. The USG and GOS signed the 
<br>Homeland Security Presidential Directive 6 (HSPD-6) 
<br>information-sharing agreement in 2007. XXXXXXXXXXXX. The DHS/ICE office within Embassy Madrid has 
<br>worked with GOS counterparts over the past year on successful 
<br>running of the IAP and in operations targeting bulk-cash 
<br>smuggling at Barajas Airport. Spain also is a founding 
<br>member of the Proliferation Security Initiative and an active 
<br>member in the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism. 
<br>As per Ref C, Spain currently is being considered for 
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000614 002.2 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>membership in the G-8 Partnership Against the Spread of 
<br>Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction. Spain also allows 
<br>us the use of two military bases that are critical transit 
<br>points between the U.S. and Iraq and Afghanistan. One recent 
<br>irritant in bilateral relationship is are the efforts by some 
<br>investigating judges - invoking "universal jurisdiction" - to 
<br>indict former USG officials for their allegedly involvement 
<br>in torture at GTMO (Ref D). 
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) Your visit to Madrid and Rubalcaba's visit to 
<br>Washington are but the latest in a series of high-level 
<br>exchanges, including a presidential bilateral on the margins 
<br>of the U.S.-EU Summit in Prague in April, a meeting between 
<br>National Security Adviser Gen. Jones and King Juan Carlos I 
<br>in Florida in February, and Foreign Minister Moratinos's 
<br>February meeting in Washington with Secretary Clinton. At 
<br>the end of May, U.S. Transportation Secretary LaHood became 
<br>the first cabinet-level visitor to Spain on behalf of the 
<br>Obama Administration. While you are in Madrid, Defense 
<br>Minister Carme Chacon will be in Washington during June 30 - 
<br>July 2 for discussions with Secretary Gates, among other 
<br>meetings (Ref E). 
<br>
<br>//THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT// 
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) In office since 2004, Zapatero won reelection to a 
<br>second term in March 2008, but his center-left Spanish 
<br>Socialist Workers Party (PSOE) is seven seats shy of a 
<br>majority in the 350-seat Congress. XXXXXXXXXXXX. Unemployment is over 17%, the 
<br>highest rate in the EU, and it is expected to reach 20% 
<br>sometime in the next year. Although popularity ratings for 
<br>Zapatero and the Socialists are low, the conservative 
<br>opposition Popular Party (PP) has struggled to capitalize on 
<br>this. The PP, hampered by internal divisions, also has been 
<br>dogged by corruption accusations. Nevertheless, Zapatero 
<br>suffered his first serious political reverse since winning 
<br>reelection when his party lost power in March 2009 regional 
<br>elections in Galicia. Zapatero shuffled the cabinet April 7 
<br>as a response to criticism of the GOS' inability to resolve 
<br>the economic crisis and with an eye to the June European 
<br>Parliament elections. The most prominent change was the 
<br>replacement of the Second Vice President/Minister of Economy 
<br>and Finance. Even so, the PP secured more seats than the 
<br>Socialists in the June 7 European Parliament elections, 
<br>another sign that Zapatero needs to focus on the economic 
<br>situation. 
<br>
<br>//YOUR MEETINGS// 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S//NF) XXXXXXXXXXXX. He may even take credit, as in the case of 
<br>adjustments in U.S.-Cuba policy, for shaping USG views. He 
<br>is not innately ill-disposed to the USG. For him, foreign 
<br>policy is subordinate to domestic political interests, and 
<br>the U.S. relationship is just one more element to be viewed 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX.
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000614 003.2 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>currently a wave of goodwill for President Obama in Spain, 
<br>which is the answer to Zapatero's prayers in that it enables 
<br>him to engage the USG without being dinged by the traditional 
<br>anti-U.S. sentiment among his socialist base. XXXXXXXXXXXX. Zapatero 
<br>does not speak English, though we think he may understand it. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C/NF) You will recall Interior Minister Rubalcaba - who 
<br>has wide-ranging responsibilities on security, law 
<br>enforcement and intelligence issues - as very capable and 
<br>serious but also charming. XXXXXXXXXXXX. He is known for his 
<br>intelligence, discretion, hard work, and mastery of detail, 
<br>as well as his negotiating prowess. XXXXXXXXXXXX. 
<br>You and Minister Rubalcaba are scheduled to sign 
<br>an MOU formalizing ongoing cooperation on the DHS's 
<br>Immigration Advisory Program (IAP) at Madrid's Barajas 
<br>Airport, where a successful pilot program recently was 
<br>carried out. You are also scheduled to sign a declaration of 
<br>intent for our two governments to work toward concluding an 
<br>agreement on Cooperation in Science & Technology for Homeland 
<br>Security Matters. Rubalcaba also is likely to continue his 
<br>Washington discussions with you on the US-EU transatlantic 
<br>agenda, border control issues, CSI, document falsification, 
<br>money laundering, and an alert system in case of the theft of 
<br>arms or explosives for terrorist purposes. He may discuss 
<br>further his recent proposal for an exchange of liaison 
<br>personnel to have officials present in each others' 
<br>headquarters. In addition to the preceding topics, you may 
<br>also wish to raise trafficking in persons, illegal 
<br>immigration, Frontex issues, and Special Interest Alien 
<br>Smuggling through Madrid-Barajas Airport en route to the 
<br>United States. Rubalcaba speaks English but prefers to have 
<br>an interpreter present during discussions of some technical 
<br>aspects of his portfolio. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) XXXXXXXXXX. Elena 
<br>Salgado is the Second Vice President and Minister of Economy 
<br>and Finance. She was moved up from being Minister of Public 
<br>Administration in April, as part of the broader cabinet 
<br>shuffle intended to highlight an intensified GOS effort to 
<br>combat the impact of the global economic crisis on Spain. 
<br>Rubalcaba reportedly was an influential figure in supporting 
<br>her appointment. XXXXXXXXXX. She previously served as Minister 
<br>of Public Administration (2007-09) and Minister of Health 
<br>(2004-07). The Spanish Government in 2006 unsuccessfully 
<br>nominated Salgado as a candidate for the Presidency of the 
<br>World Health Organization. Salgado also has extensive 
<br>private sector experience in consulting and 
<br>telecommunications industries. Salgado, born in 1949, has 
<br>degrees in industrial engineering and economics. Salgado 
<br>would be an appropriate GOS official with whom to discuss 
<br>CSI, money laundering and bulk-cash smuggling, and the USG's 
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000614 004.2 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>relationship with Spanish Customs. Salgado speaks English.
