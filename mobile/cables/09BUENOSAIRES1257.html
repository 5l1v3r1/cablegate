<br>----------
<br>Summary
<br>----------
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) The Financial Action Task Force (FATF)
<br>held a two week peer review of the Argentine anti-money laundering
<br>and counter terror finance (AML/CFT) regime. Although hoping to
<br>see some positive moves by Argentina, the FATF operational team
<br>leader is skeptical of the GoA's intentions to combat money
<br>laundering and terror finance. While most money laundering in
<br>Argentina conceals tax evasion and corruption, narcotics-derived
<br>funds are a growing problem. The Argentine statutory framework is
<br>relatively strong, but the bureaucracy working the issues is poorly
<br>led and starved of resources. Consequently, the FATF team leader
<br>views Argentine AML/CFT enforcement as largely ineffectual, with no
<br>meaningful prosecutions in recent memory. Some Embassy contacts
<br>argue that the current GoA leadership, including the President,
<br>stands to lose from honest and vigorous pursuit of money
<br>laundering. While the final FATF report is likely to embarrass the
<br>GoA, potentially provoking a harsh response, it is not likely to
<br>spur meaningful reform. Until now, terror financing and narcotics
<br>money have comprised just a small fraction of the illicit funds
<br>transiting Argentina. The near complete absence of enforcement
<br>coupled with a culture of impunity and corruption make Argentina
<br>ripe for exploitation by narco-traffickers and terrorist cells.
<br>For now, the most promising way to engage the GoA on the issue
<br>seems to be through the new Justice Minister, with whom we have
<br>developed a positive working relationship. We will encourage him
<br>to engage on this set of issues. End Summary.
<br>
<br>---------------
<br>FATF Review
<br>---------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) The FATF peer review of Argentina's AML/CFT laws,
<br>regulations and enforcement, and general compliance with FATF best
<br>practices and recommendations began on November 16 and continued
<br>for two weeks. FATF had originally scheduled the review for last
<br>year but delayed it at Argentina's request. In the interim, the
<br>GoA implemented a tax amnesty law to encourage the repatriation of
<br>funds held overseas and in the process lost most of the AML/CFT
<br>focus and momentum it had built up after the last FATF review in
<br>October 2003. Econoff met with numerous AML/CFT contacts over
<br>several weeks before the review began to assess the strengths and
<br>weaknesses of Argentina's laws and enforcement efforts and to
<br>evaluate perceptions of how it will fare in the review.
<br>
<br>---------------------------------
<br>FATF Team Leader is a Skeptic
<br>---------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Fabio Contini, the Italian national who heads the
<br>operational review team, has spent over a year in Argentina as the
<br>Economic and Financial AttachC) at the Italian Embassy and is
<br>married to an Argentine. He has a sober view of the GoA's AML/CFT
<br>efforts, which he deems little more than a fig-leaf. The measures
<br>taken, he said, are calculated for minimal compliance with
<br>international standards and evince little real enthusiasm for
<br>cleaning up the financial system. In addition, he said that
<br>Argentina should take control of the informal economy as a first
<br>step toward a serious AML/CFT effort. Contini summarized his views
<br>by noting that a substantial percentage of the Argentine economy is
<br>underground, with pure cash transactions comprising a
<br>disproportionate percentage of economic activity. Such an economic
<br>system, he observed, is inherently vulnerable to money laundering
<br>and other financial crimes. Contini said that Argentina will have
<br>to bring this black economy into the light of day before even the
<br>most robust AML/CFT regulations can be effective.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) While his views will be influential, Contini noted that he
<br>does not have the last word on Argentina's FATF peer assessment.
<br>Once his team makes its report, Argentina will have an opportunity
<br>to respond to the findings. A debate at next year's plenary will
<br>precede the issuance of the final report and any warnings. Contini
<br>said that FATF warned Argentina after the last review that a second
<br>warning could have a negative effect on Argentina's desire to
<br>rejoin the international financial system.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------
<br>Money Laundering in Argentina
<br>--------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Embassy contacts agree that most money laundering in
<br>Argentina is the product of tax evasion and political corruption.
<br>For the most part, they insist that terror financing is seldom, if
<br>ever, transacted in Argentina. Most maintain, however, that
<br>narcotics trafficking is becoming a real problem and that,
<br>increasingly, the dirty money sloshing through the financial system
<br>originates in the drug trade.
<br>
<br>-------------------
<br>AML/CFT System
<br>-------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Embassy contacts, including Contini, have noted numerous
<br>weaknesses in Argentina's AML/CFT regime. Most tellingly, there
<br>have been only two convictions since the criminalization of money
<br>laundering in 1989, and there have been no convictions under the
<br>currently applicable statute enacted in 2000. While the
<br>substantive law is generally considered adequate, there are
<br>numerous loopholes to close and important areas that require
<br>clarification.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Local AML/CFT experts agree that, with the exceptions noted
<br>below, Argentina has a solid legal and regulatory foundation for
<br>combating money laundering and terror finance. The failures of the
<br>system arise when it comes to applying the law. Inspections are
<br>superficial and do not examine actual accounts and transactions.
<br>According to Pablo San Martin, the head of SMS Latinoamerica, a
<br>local accounting firm, inspectors are often content in their
<br>interviews with banking executives to accept the predictable
<br>anodyne responses to their inquiries without further follow-up.
<br>Several contacts point to the Financial Information Unit (UIF) as
<br>the weakest player on the financial crimes enforcement team, but
<br>the consensus is that a failure of political will cripples the
<br>whole AML/CFT project.
<br>
<br>---------------
<br>Self-laundering
<br>---------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Several experts have highlighted the money laundering
<br>loophole for criminals who do their own banking as a probable focus
<br>of the FATF review. Argentine law defines money laundering as an
<br>accessory offense so that, for example, a narcotics trafficker
<br>cannot be charged for merely laundering the profits from his drug
<br>deals. Only a third party who aids and abets in hiding the origins
<br>of the money is subject to prosecution.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) According to Raul Plee, the state's attorney who heads the
<br>unit charged with investigating financial crimes, this exemption
<br>for self-laundering explains the lack of convictions. Plee noted
<br>that a bill in draft form would allow him to pursue much of the
<br>currently protected laundering activity, and he believes that FATF
<br>will recommend enactment of the legislation. Plee observed that
<br>some of Argentina's most embarrassing prosecutorial failures, e.g.,
<br>when a judge dismissed charges against Pablo Escobar's widow who
<br>bought two properties under an assumed name, originate in the
<br>self-laundering exemption.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) In contrast, other contacts believe that if the FATF
<br>review fixates on the self-laundering issue it will be a failure.
<br>Marcelo Casanovas, a compliance officer with the Bank of Buenos
<br>Aires Province and a board member of a leading anti-money
<br>laundering association, said that self-laundering is a problem, but
<br>to focus exclusively on that one shortcoming is to miss the whole
<br>forest for one tree. The real problems, he insisted, are systemic.
<br>Contini himself observed that the central failure is an absence of
<br>political will to pursue laundering as a serious crime.
<br>
<br>----------------------
<br>Repatriation of Funds
<br>----------------------
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) One substantive legal issue that now seems unlikely to
<br>trouble FATF reviewers is the tax amnesty law (Ref A) designed to
<br>encourage repatriation of funds held outside Argentina. According
<br>to commonly cited estimates, Argentines hide about $150 billion in
<br>assets offshore. In an effort to lure back the billions held
<br>outside the formal financial system, the GoA passed legislation in
<br>
<br>
<br>December 2008 declaring an amnesty on repatriated funds that ran
<br>from March through August of 2009. Local experts and opposition
<br>political figures alleged that because it prohibited Argentine tax
<br>authorities from inquiring into the source of the repatriated
<br>funds, the law facilitated money laundering. FATF also expressed
<br>misgivings but was at least partially placated when then-Justice
<br>Minister Anibal Fernandez defended the law before the plenary in
<br>Paris. In May (after the amnesty had already been in effect for
<br>two months), the UIF issued rules requiring reports of suspicious
<br>transactions (STRs) arising from the capital regularization
<br>program.
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) According to figures released by the GoA at the conclusion
<br>of the amnesty, Argentines declared only $4.7 billion. Of that,
<br>only 4.3 percent had been held abroad. The press reported that the
<br>program failed to achieve its goal of capital repatriation.
<br>According to Plee, requiring submission of STRs was a key factor in
<br>this failure and was at least one reason that very little money
<br>returned under this law. Plee and other contacts noted that the
<br>funds declared under the amnesty were not generally the product of
<br>criminal activity other than simple tax evasion. The Regional
<br>Advisor from the International Monetary Fund's Financial Integrity
<br>Group, Mariano Federici, observed that the repatriation was doomed
<br>from the outset because Argentines do not view the local economy as
<br>a stable place to invest, and they mistrust the government because
<br>of its history of economic mismanagement and capricious seizure of
<br>assets.
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Based on the requirement to file STRs and the
<br>insignificant scale of the funds repatriated, many contacts
<br>predicted that the tax amnesty issue will not draw much attention
<br>under the FATF review.
<br>
<br>------------------------
<br>Prosecutors and Judges
<br>------------------------
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) Another weakness that experts highlighted was the lack of
<br>judicial and prosecutorial understanding of AML/CFT issues.
<br>According to Federici, the prosecutors and judges who should take
<br>the lead in AML/CFT cases lack the financial sophistication
<br>necessary to direct investigations and mount successful
<br>prosecutions. Federici also noted that judges appear uninterested
<br>in acquiring the skills necessary to manage money laundering cases.
<br>When the IMF staged a training seminar, over 70 prosecutors
<br>participated, but of the dozens invited, only one judge chose to
<br>attend. Because judges directly manage investigations under the
<br>Argentine legal system, no money laundering case can proceed
<br>without active judicial engagement. Federici observed that, in the
<br>short term, judicial indifference limits the opportunities for
<br>money laundering convictions.
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) Casanovas agreed that the judicial system suffers
<br>deficiencies, but he maintained that prosecutors and investigators
<br>bear more of the blame than judges. Failure to develop solid
<br>evidence is the root of the problem, he said. He observed that
<br>judges want to pursue concrete cases with predictable outcomes, not
<br>squander their limited resources on prosecutions doomed to failure.
<br>
<br>
<br>----------------------------------
<br>FATF/GAFISUD Representative
<br>----------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) The FATF Representative's Office, headed by Alejandro
<br>Strega, who has a master's in law from the University of Illinois,
<br>is responsible for coordination of AML/CFT policy and for
<br>developing national strategy and legislation. Under the leadership
<br>of Strega's predecessor, Juan Felix Marteau, the office earned a
<br>reputation for foresight and action. Marteau drafted significant
<br>legislation and developed a national AML/CFT strategy that was
<br>endorsed by then- President Nestor Kirchner. In contrast, Strega's
<br>performance has been lackluster, and, with his weak background in
<br>AML/CFT and lack of resources, he has been largely ineffective.
<br>Strega is a congenial interlocutor, speaks English well, and is
<br>eager to engage with the Embassy, but he has little access to
<br>Minister of Justice Julio Alak, few staff, and almost no money.
<br>
<br>¶17. (C) Marteau has insinuated that he lost the job to Strega as a
<br>reprisal for looking too closely into the casino business, where
<br>important Kirchneristas allegedly have interests. Federici
<br>conceded that casinos may be part of the story, but said the real
<br>
<br>explanation lies in a personality clash and bureaucratic feud with
<br>Alak's predecessor and current Chief of Cabinet, Anibal Fernandez.
<br>According to Federici, when Marteau drafted his national strategy,
<br>he consulted all high government officials with an interest in
<br>money laundering except for Fernandez, who was Minister of Interior
<br>at that time. As Justice Minister, Fernandez became Marteau's boss
<br>and quickly dismissed him and brought in Strega. Federici also
<br>noted that suspicions of connections to drug trafficking and money
<br>laundering have sometimes wafted around Fernandez (Ref B), and
<br>Marteau may have distrusted him based on those rumors. Strega is
<br>the son of a labor lawyer who is a close Fernandez confederate from
<br>his time as Mayor of Quilmes. His father, Enrique Strega, has been
<br>an attorney for the bank workers' union headed by Juan Jose Zanola,
<br>a Kirchner ally who was also close to former President Menem.
<br>Zanola is now under indictment in a politically radioactive case
<br>involving adulterated medicine, illegal campaign contributions, and
<br>a triple homicide.
<br>
<br>-------------------------
<br>UIF: a Broken Institution
<br>-------------------------
<br>
<br>¶18. (S/NF) Numerous Embassy contacts and press reports have
<br>fingered the UIF as the main agent of Argentina's AML/CFT failures.
<br>The UIF is an inept and politically compromised institution,
<br>according to Federici. It is led by Rosa Falduto, who won her
<br>position based on the patronage of the judge who oversees the
<br>electoral process, Maria Romilda Servini de Cubria. She has since
<br>quarreled with Servini. Her other benefactor, Anibal Fernandez,
<br>has also reportedly been keeping his distance. Federici said that
<br>according to a highly placed contact in the UIF, Falduto holds on
<br>to her position because she is useful to President Cristina
<br>Fernandez de Kirchner and to her husband, the former President,
<br>Nestor Kirchner. Federici told Econoff that Falduto is personally
<br>holding back STRs on the Kirchner inner circle and has refused to
<br>respond to requests for STRs on the Kirchners themselves from
<br>Switzerland, Lichtenstein, and Luxembourg. In July, according to
<br>Federici and consistent with information from other sources,
<br>Falduto also personally leaked information that the UIF had
<br>requested from FinCEN on Francisco de Narvaez, a Kirchner rival.
<br>According to Federici, Falduto did this by design to harm the
<br>reputation of this important opposition figure.
<br>
<br>¶19. (C) The defects of the UIF, however, transcend mere
<br>politicization. According to Federici and confirmed by several
<br>other sources, Falduto's organization passes on raw intelligence
<br>that is useless for building criminal cases. Contini said that
<br>information is routinely forwarded to prosecutors so long after the
<br>fact that it is legally and technically impossible to accumulate
<br>evidence on suspicious transactions. In the UIF's defense,
<br>however, San Martin noted that the AML/CFT regulators have
<br>insufficient resources. The UIF and the Argentine Central Bank pay
<br>poorly, he said, and cannot afford to hire sufficient investigative
<br>staff. San Martin agreed, however, that the UIF is likely to come
<br>in for pointed criticism in the FATF review.
<br>
<br>--------------
<br>Political Will
<br>--------------
<br>
<br>¶20. (C) Several contacts, including Strega himself, have asserted
<br>that the Argentine AML/CFT regime was never designed to catch or
<br>punish money launderers and that the absence of convictions is by
<br>design. According to Federici, Plee's office does not get the
<br>political support that it needs to do its job and the Ministry of
<br>Justice under Fernandez made it plain that it did not want him to
<br>be too aggressive. When the MOJ switched Plee's assistant Federico
<br>di Pasquale from a long-term to a short-term job contract, it was
<br>seen as a message that the office was on a short leash.
<br>
<br>¶21. (C) According to Roberto Bulit Goni, an attorney in a private
<br>practice dealing with money laundering issues, too many people
<br>stand to profit from lax enforcement of money laundering statutes.
<br>Casanovas and San Martin agree that the changes that there have
<br>been in the AML/CFT system are mainly cosmetic. The GoA has
<br>enacted the recommended laws and regulations, but the problem, they
<br>noted, is hostility to even token enforcement. Congress, which
<br>will pass to a divided opposition's control in December, has not
<br>played a consistent role in pressing for enforcement or
<br>investigations, but there is some prospect that the Congress and
<br>specific committees will give it increasing attention in 2010.
<br>
<br>¶22. (C) The Embassy sources noted above maintain that the MOJ,
<br>under former Minister of Justice Anibal Fernandez (now Chief of
<br>Cabinet), systematically frustrated progress on AML/CFT issues.
<br>The current Minister of Justice, Julio Alak, has brought energy and
<br>a fresh perspective to the job and has shown considerable
<br>enthusiasm for collaborating with the United States on a wide range
<br>of law enforcement issues. While he has not yet focused on money
<br>laundering, the upcoming FATF report and the Argentine response and
<br>debate at next year's plenary give us an opportunity to engage him
<br>to focus more on AML/CFT issues. While a negative report will
<br>likely provoke a hostile response from some quarters of the GoA, it
<br>could well provide an opportunity and political cover for Alak to
<br>push for greater resources and for consequential changes in the law
<br>and enforcement. Alak appears to be serious about tackling
<br>Argentina's law enforcement problems (Ref C) and all Mission
<br>elements will continue to provide him with the information and,
<br>where possible, the resources to move forward with a positive
<br>agenda.
<br>
<br>----------------
<br>FATF Outcome
<br>-----------------
<br>
<br>¶23. (C) There are two views of the likely conclusions in the final
<br>FATF report. One view is that the FATF review will be so
<br>superficial that Argentina will pass with just a few areas for
<br>improvement noted. Casanovas and San Martin, for example, believe
<br>that the FATF review will be perfunctory. Reviewers will arrive
<br>with a checklist and conclude after talking to regulators that all
<br>the elements are in place. FATF will recommend some changes, but
<br>the review will be generally neutral. The other view is that the
<br>flaws are so glaring, i.e., no convictions and the problems within
<br>the UIF, that even a superficial review will come down hard on the
<br>GoA. Contini, as head of the operational team, seems inclined to
<br>issue a report highlighting a lack of political will to
<br>meaningfully combat money laundering and terror financing.
<br>
<br>----------
<br>Comment
<br>----------
<br>
<br>¶24. (S/NF) Argentina will likely suffer some sharp criticism in
<br>the FATF review, blackening its eye when it is seeking to reenter
<br>the mainstream of the global financial system. The GOA would
<br>probably lash out publicly at a critical FATF review, with the
<br>government blaming the criticisms on external conspirators
<br>(including perhaps the USG). No matter the criticisms, and despite
<br>the apparent good faith of new players like Justice Minister Alak,
<br>it is probably unrealistic to expect that the GoA will funnel
<br>resources to prosecutors or make a concerted effort to pursue money
<br>launderers. The Kirchners and their circle simply have too much to
<br>gain themselves from continued lax enforcement. Although tax
<br>cheats and compromised politicians may still be the chief source of
<br>dirty money, continued GoA indifference to AML/CFT could offer an
<br>attractive local staging ground to narco-traffickers and
<br>international terrorists. If the GoA does not move to close
<br>loopholes and enhance enforcement, it may soon find its financial
<br>system contaminated by drug money and terror funds.
