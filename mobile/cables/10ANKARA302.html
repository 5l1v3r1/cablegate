<br> 
<br>REF: ANKARA 263 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: AMB James F. Jeffrey, for reasons 1.4 (b,d) 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) Summary:  During February 18 "Shared Vision and 
<br>Structured Dialogue" meetings in Ankara,   Turkish MFA 
<br>Undersecretary Sinirlioglu: 
<br> 
<br>-- Appealed for "simultaneity" between Armenian Protocols 
<br>ratification and the Minsk Process; 
<br>-- Registered increasing GoT dissatisfaction with Iraqi PM 
<br>Malaki; 
<br>-- Expressed hope USF-I CG Odierno's engagement would elicit 
<br>substantive cooperation from the KRG against the terrorist 
<br>PKK; 
<br>-- Urged higher profile USG involvment in the Cyprus 
<br>reunification talks, and; 
<br>-- Confirmed GoT interest in further dialogue on missile 
<br>defense. 
<br> 
<br>End Summary. 
<br> 
<br>IRAN 
<br>---- 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) Burns strongly urged Sinirlioglu to support action to 
<br>convince the Iranian government it is on the wrong course. 
<br>Sinirliolgu reaffirmed the GoT's opposition to a nuclear 
<br>Iran; however, he registered fear about the collateral impact 
<br>military action might have on Turkey and contended sanctions 
<br>would unite Iranians behind the regime and harm the 
<br>opposition.  Burns acknowledged Turkey's exposure to the 
<br>economic effects of sanctions as a neighbor to Iran, but 
<br>reminded Sinirlioglu Turkish interests would suffer if Israel 
<br>were to act militarily to forestall Iran's acquisition of 
<br>nuclear weapons or if Egypt and Saudi Arabia were to seek 
<br>nuclear arsenals of their own.  He said the international 
<br>community's patience with Iran had been met with the Iranian 
<br>refusal, since October, to work with the P5-plus-1, the 
<br>clandestine enrichment facility near Qom and Tehran's recent 
<br>decison to enrich its low-enriched uranium to 20%.  The 
<br>IAEA's creative proposal to fabricate new fuel assemblies for 
<br>the Tehran Research Reactor had stumbled on a technically 
<br>unfeasible Iranian counter-offer for a simultaneous exchange 
<br>in Iran of Iranian fuel for fuel assemblies.  Carefully 
<br>constructed sanctions, Burns argued, targeting the 
<br>increasingly pervasive economic power of the Iranian 
<br>Revolutionary Guard Corps, would convey the international 
<br>community's unity and determination.  "We'll keep the door 
<br>open to engagement," he stressed.  A visibly disheartened 
<br>Sinirlioglu conceded a unified message is important.  He 
<br>acknowledged the countries of the region perceive Iran as a 
<br>growing threat:  "Alarm bells are ringing even in Damascus." 
<br> 
<br>ARMENIA 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) Sinirlioglu appealed for "simultaneity" between 
<br>Armenian Protocols ratification and the Minsk Process.  He 
<br>emphasized "a strong reaction" against the protocols among 
<br>ruling party MPs had to be overcome before the government 
<br>would hazard a ratification effort.  He warned Congressional 
<br>passage of an Armenian genocide resolution would "complicate" 
<br>his government's domestic political calculations regarding 
<br>ratification.  He said if something acceptable to Azerbaijani 
<br>President Aliyev can found, then "we can move" the protocols 
<br>forward.  Sinirlioglu suggested Azerbaijan and Armenia's 
<br>announcement of an agreed framework for Minsk Group progress 
<br>would provide the GoT with the necessary political cover. 
<br>Burns inquired about the prospect for progress on a natural 
<br>gas deal between Turkey and Azerbaijan.  Sinirlioglu implied 
<br> 
<br>ANKARA 00000302  002 OF 005 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Aliyev is holding an agreement hostage to Turkey's handling 
<br>of the protocols:  "He doesn't trust us." 
<br> 
<br>IRAQ 
<br>---- 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) Sinirlioglu registered the GoT's increasing 
<br>dissatisfaction with PM Malaki and fear that he is tending 
<br>"to get out of control."  "He is preoccupied with his 
<br>political survival;" nevertheless, Sinirlioglu continued, 
<br>the GoT is in frequent contact with him.  The MFA hosted 
<br>Maliki advisors Sadiq al Rikabi and Tariq al Najmi to 
<br>meetings 10 days prior.  Sinirlioglu lamented Iran's efforts 
<br>to influence the election.  He noted Saudi Arabia is also 
<br>"throwing around money" among the political parties in Iraq 
<br>because it is unwilling to accept the inevitability of Shia 
<br>dominance there.  "We want a free, transparent and fair 
<br>election," he said, "we need to forestall a deepening of the 
<br>sectarian divide." 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) After the March 7 elections, Sinirlioglu said, Turkey 
<br>would initiate an effort to connect Iraqi gas fields to the 
<br>Turkish grid via a 300 kilometer pipeline, costing USD 500 
<br>million.  He asserted the pipeline could begin pumping within 
<br>two years.  He alleged Iranian opposition to the pipeline 
<br>because most of Iraq's gas fields are in Kurdish and Sunni 
<br>areas.  Sinirlioglu advocated a second pipeline that would 
<br>give Iraqi oil an alternative to the Gulf as a route to 
<br>Europe once the country is able to meet its OPEC quota.  He 
<br>asserted the piplines' construction would pull the several 
<br>Iraqi communities together into a common project.  The 
<br>creation of new "common assets," he said, could be more 
<br>important for its politically unifying effect than its 
<br>economic impact. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) Sinirlioglu registered his appreciation for USF-I 
<br>Commanding General Odierno's recent visit.  He hoped for the 
<br>early drafting of an action plan that would elicit more 
<br>cooperation from the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) 
<br>against the terrorist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) 
<br>leadership harboring in northern Iraq:  "We want the KRG to 
<br>understand that working with us is important." 
<br> 
<br>ISRAEL 
<br>------ 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) Burns focused on Turkey's strained relationship with 
<br>Israel.  Sinirlioglu argued "the problem is not bilateral, 
<br>but general."  He attributed increasing regional country 
<br>frustration with Israel to the stalled Peace Process, 
<br>especially on the Palestinian track.  He blamed the lack of 
<br>progress on Israeli intransigence, which caused regional 
<br>stake-holders to question Netanyahu's goals.  He contended 
<br>the "humanitarian situation in Gaza," which is not a 
<br>punishment of Hamas, but of the Gazan people, fed Turkish 
<br>popular anger against Israel.  Even so, bilateral cooperation 
<br>with Israel is continuing.  Turkey is acquiring Israeli 
<br>military equipment, notably Heron UAVs.  Direct flights 
<br>between the two countries are routine.  Two-way trade is 
<br>healthy, he said, tourism has dropped recently, but "will 
<br>recover."  Sinirlioglu described Israeli Defense Minister 
<br>Ehud Barak's mid-January visit as "very good."  He noted the 
<br>MFA is exploring the possibility of arranging a meeting 
<br>between the two prime ministers on the margins of an 
<br>international gathering.  Returning to a GoT obsession, he 
<br>recalled the Turkey-brokered Syria-Israel proximity talks, 
<br>"which were shattered by Cast Lead," Israel's December 2008 
<br>military operation in Gaza.  Burns noted Syria places high 
<br>value on Turkey's role as a mediator and repeated Senator 
<br>Mitchell's statement that Turkey-brokered proximity talks can 
<br>make an important contribution to the Peace Process. 
<br> 
<br>ANKARA 00000302  003 OF 005 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>SYRIA 
<br>----- 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (C) Sinirlioglu contended Turkey's diplomatic efforts are 
<br>beginning to pull Syria out of Iran's orbit.  He said a 
<br>shared hatred for Saddam had been the original impetus for 
<br>their unlikely alliance.  "Now, their interests are 
<br>diverging."  Once again pitching Israel-Syria proximity 
<br>talks, Sinirlioglu contended Israel's acceptance of Turkey as 
<br>a mediator could break Syria free of Tehran's influence and 
<br>further isolate Iran. 
<br> 
<br>EU, CYPRUS and GREECE 
<br>--------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C) Sinirlioglu said Turkey's EU accession is being 
<br>obstructed by the politically motivated objections of several 
<br>member states, notably France, Austria and Cyprus.  He 
<br>reserved special criticism for President Sarkozy.  He accused 
<br>France of changing the rules mid-game.  He contended French 
<br>opposition to Turkey's membership is "deepening the cultural 
<br>divide" between Christian Europe and the Muslim world:  "A 
<br>wider audience is watching this." 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (C) He regretted perceived Greek Cypriot complacency 
<br>regarding the island's reunification talks:  EU "membership 
<br>makes them invulnerable."  Greek Cypriots, he said, want the 
<br>world to forget the progress achieved by the Annan Plan in 
<br>¶2004.  They pretend relations between the island's two 
<br>communities are an internal affair, even though, by treaty, 
<br>it's been an international issue for 50 years.  Talat's 
<br>cross-voting proposal, Sinirlioglu continued, should have 
<br>been a breakthrough, but the Greek Cypriots failed to react. 
<br>Downer is frustrated, Sinirlioglu alleged, and so are the 
<br>Turkish Cypriots.  He implied the island's Turkish community 
<br>would register its frustration by voting out Talat as TRNC 
<br>"president" in April.  He renewed Turkey's appeal for higher 
<br>profile direct USG involvement in the negotiations. 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (C) Sinirlioglu welcomed Greek PM Papandeou's belated 
<br>response to Erdogan's October 30 letter seeking a frank new 
<br>discussion of the two neighbors' several long-running 
<br>disputes.  He conceded Papandreou's delay is understandable 
<br>in light of his likely preoccupation with Greece's acute 
<br>financial crisis.  Based on Papandreou's response, 
<br>Sinirlioglu said, Turkey expects to begin new talks with 
<br>Greece soon. 
<br> 
<br>AFGHANISTAN, PAKISTAN and INDIA 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (C) Burns opened the discussion on Afghanistan with 
<br>praise for Turkey's military, training and development 
<br>contributions there.  Sinirlioglu said Turkey had chosen to 
<br>focus on three Afghan challenges:  "the marriage of Wahhabism 
<br>and Pashtun nationalism"; the chronic antagonism between 
<br>Afghanistan and Pakistan, and; the country's security forces 
<br>deficit.  He said Turkey plans to address the first by 
<br>ramping up its education programs in Afghanistan; the second 
<br>by pursuing its trilateral Ankara Process, which sponsors 
<br>meetings of senior Afghan and Pakistani ministerial and 
<br>intelligence counterparts, and; the third by establishing a 
<br>police training center in Kabul that aims for a throughput of 
<br>5160 trainees per year.  Keying off the last point, AMB Tacan 
<br>Ildem, who recently concluded an assignment as Turkey's NATO 
<br>PERMREP, declared the EUPOL police training effort in 
<br>Afghanistan a failure.  He said the EU's  criticism of 
<br>Turkey's unwillingness to work directly with EUPOL is 
<br>unjustified.  He argued, since Turkey does not have a 
<br>security agreement with the EU and is excluded from the 
<br> 
<br>ANKARA 00000302  004 OF 005 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP), the GoT lacks a 
<br>legal basis on which to cooperate with EUPOL.  "We would like 
<br>the EU to involve us not as a third country, but, in view of 
<br>our accumulated rights," as a candidate for membership.  He 
<br>urged the USG not to coordinate bilateral agreements to 
<br>support EU operations but, instead, to route all cooperation 
<br>with the EU on security issues through NATO. 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (C) Deputy Undersecretary for South Asian Affairs Engin 
<br>Soysal led the discussion on Pakistan.  He described the 
<br>Ankara Process and the recent Turkey-sponsored Afghanistan 
<br>Neighbors Summit as Turkish efforts to assert regional 
<br>responsibility for South Asia's inter-linked problems.  He 
<br>said Turkey had not invited India to the neighbors summit in 
<br>deference to Pakistani sensitivities; however, he claimed, 
<br>Pakistan understands attempting to exclude India from the 
<br>nascent South Asian regional structures would be a mistake. 
<br>He reported Indian Prime Minister Singh had requested 
<br>President Gul's assistance with Pakistan during the latter's 
<br>visit to New Delhi the previous week.  Acting on that 
<br>request, Gul had phoned Pakistani President Zardari, who was 
<br>skeptical of Indian intentions.  Gul is planning to visit 
<br>Pakistan later this year.  Soysal said Iran is proposing a 
<br>quadrilateal summit, which would include Turkey, Afghanistan 
<br>and Pakistan, but that proposal had yet to generate 
<br>enthusiasm. 
<br> 
<br>¶14. (C) Soysal, Turkey's former ambassador to Pakistan, said 
<br>the Pakistani military, though displeased with Zardari, 
<br>remains unwilling to intervene; nevertheless, senior 
<br>officers' patience may not be infinite.  Zardari needs to 
<br>increase the democratic legitimacy of parliament.  Soysal 
<br>offered.  Nawaz Sharif has become a much more constructive 
<br>player. 
<br> 
<br>¶15. (C) Soysal urged a NATO training role in Pakistan. 
<br>Picking up from Soysal, Tacan Ildem suggested NATO invite 
<br>Pakistani military officers to courses at Oberammergau. 
<br> 
<br>BOSNIA 
<br>------ 
<br> 
<br>¶16. (C) Sinirlioglu registered the GoT's determination to 
<br>resist perceived EU efforts to exclude Turkey from the 
<br>Balkans, particularly Bosnia.  He identified effecting 
<br>rapprochement between Bosnia and Serbia as Turkey's immediate 
<br>diplomatic goal for the region.  Towards that end, 
<br>Sinirlioglu said, we convinced Haris Siladjdzic, who had been 
<br>in Ankara the day before, to cease references to Serbian 
<br>"genocide."    The United States and Turkey have "agreed to 
<br>disagree" on the Membership Action Plan (MAP) for Bosnia; 
<br>nevertheless, "we value your involvement in the Balkans." 
<br> 
<br>BILATERAL EUROPEAN RELATIONS, NATO 
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶17. (C) Burns inquired about Turkey's bilateral relations 
<br>with Europe.  Sinirlioglu briefly recapped Turkey's 
<br>unhappiness with Sarkozy.  He described his country's 
<br>relationship with Austria as infected by the latter's ethnic 
<br>prejudice.  He complained Belgium and Denmark are reluctant 
<br>to suppress terrorist PKK-affiliated organizations active in 
<br>their countries.  Tacan Ildem added that, as part of the 2009 
<br>POTUS-brokered deal that had overcome Turkish objections to 
<br>the appointment of Anders Fogh Rasmussen as NATO Secretary 
<br>General, Denmark had promised to clarify its legal 
<br>requirements prerequiste to acceding to Turkey's request for 
<br>the closure of Roj TV, a PKK mouthpiece.  This still needed 
<br>to be done, Ildem said. 
<br> 
<br>¶18. (C) Picking up from Ildem, Sinirlioglu recalled the 
<br> 
<br>ANKARA 00000302  005 OF 005 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>POTUS-brokered deal had included an understanding that a 
<br>qualified Turk would be considered for Assistant Secretary 
<br>General.  Instead, he said, a German of uncompelling merit 
<br>was selected.  "We suspect a deal between Rasmussen and 
<br>Merkel."  Ildem complained high-level positions should be 
<br>part of NATO reform:  "We missed an opportunity with the 
<br>selection of the Assistant Secretary General."  Sinirlioglu 
<br>added:  "We let Rasmussen have Secretary General, because we 
<br>trusted you." 
<br> 
<br>MISSILE DEFENSE 
<br>--------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶19. (C) Sinirlioglu inquired about Russia's reaction on 
<br>missile defense.  Burns said the Russians are much more 
<br>relaxed towards the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) and we 
<br>hope to have more conversations on missile defense 
<br>bilaterally and, eventually, within the NATO-Russia Council. 
<br>Sinirlioglu recalled PM Erdogan's request in his recent 
<br>meeting with SECDEF Gates that the Iranian threat not be 
<br>highlighted to justify PAA.
