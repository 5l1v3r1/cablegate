<br>Classified By: Anne W. Patterson, reasons 1.4 (b), (d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (U) This is a corrected copy of reftel.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Summary: The U.S.-Pakistan Economic Dialogue was held
<br>in Islamabad on August 11, co-chaired by Assistant Secretary
<br>of State for Economic, Energy, and Business Affairs Dan
<br>Sullivan and Pakistani Minister of Finance Syed Naveed Qamar.
<br>A topic of particular concern was the current state of the
<br>economy, and the GOP's efforts to manage their budget deficit
<br>and rapidly decreasing foreign exchange reserves. The GOP
<br>asked for U.S. assistance in seeking external financing. The
<br>Labor Secretary said that the GOP was making progress towards
<br>resuming surprise labor inspections. Both sides agreed that
<br>Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) experts should reconvene
<br>very soon with a goal of completing negotiations by year end.
<br>On terrorism financing, the GOP said it was committed to the
<br>1267 process but felt that it had a few deficiencies. A
<br>broad range of other topics was covered, including
<br>macroeconomic policy, BIT, intellectual property rights
<br>(IPR), energy, agriculture, terrorism financing,
<br>Reconstruction Opport
<br>unity Zones (ROZ), foreign assistance and Federally
<br>Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) development, regional
<br>cooperation and transit trade, and private sector
<br>cooperation. The GOP also pitched a proposal for a new
<br>scholarship program.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) U.S. participants included Ambassador Anne Patterson,
<br>Acting Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for South Asia
<br>Claudio Lilienfeld, Treasury Deputy Assistant Secretary Bob
<br>Dohner, Linda Droker from the U.S. Department of Commerce,
<br>USAID Senior Deputy Assistant Administrator for Asia Mark
<br>Ward, and U.S. Embassy EconOffs. Ministry of Finance
<br>Secretary Farrakh Qayyum and Advisor to the Prime Minister on
<br>Finance and Economic Affairs xxxxxxxxxxxx led the Pakistani
<br>delegation in multiple sessions in which Finance Minister
<br>Qamar was not present. Government of Pakistan (GOP)
<br>participation included Secretaries from the Ministries of
<br>Finance, Commerce, Agriculture, Labor and Water & Power, as
<br>well as representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
<br>Ministry of Interior, Higher Education Commission, State Bank
<br>of Pakistan, Intellectual Property Organization, Board of
<br>Investment and Federally Administered Tribal Areas
<br>Secretariat. End summary.

<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Pakistani Finance Minister Syed Naveed Qamar opened
<br>the 2008 U.S.-Pakistan Economic Dialogue by thanking the
<br>United States for its long history of support and assistance.
<br>Recognizing that Pakistan is currently facing multiple
<br>economic challenges, Qamar emphasized that additional U.S.
<br>assistance programs would help Pakistan through its current
<br>economic troubles. Assistant Secretary Sullivan reiterated
<br>the USG's broad commitment to Pakistan and expressed the U.S.
<br>desire to strengthen business-to-business and
<br>people-to-people contacts between the two nations. The
<br>Assistant Secretary described the 2008 Economic Dialogue as
<br>the most recent step in a series of high-level meetings
<br>between the two governments, including Prime Minister
<br>Gilani's July visit to Washington.
<br>
<br>Macroeconomic policy
<br>- - - - - - - - - -
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) During the macroeconomic section, Assistant
<br>Secretary Sullivan and DAS Dohner noted U.S. concern over
<br>increasing signs of weakness in the Pakistani economy and
<br>stressed that additional assistance from international
<br>financial institutions could be done only in conjunction with
<br>GOP monetary and fiscal reforms, such as ceasing to finance
<br>the fiscal deficit through the central bank, expanding the
<br>
<br>Islamabad 00003010 002 of 008
<br>
<br>
<br>tax base, and privatizing more rapidly. DAS Dohner stressed
<br>the importance of the GOP meeting the 4.7 percent of GDP
<br>fiscal deficit target, but noted that hitting this target
<br>would take significant effort on the part of the GOP. When
<br>asked about contingencies should the budget target not be met
<br>and the status of foreign reserves, Finance Minister Qamar
<br>replied that "all measures" including gas rationing "are in
<br>the cards." Regarding reserves, he said they continue to
<br>deplete "at a fairly rapid rate."
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) The Prime Minister's Special Assistant for Finance
<br>and Economic Affairs xxxxxxxxxxxx and Finance Minister
<br>Qamar noted there were indeed structural deficiencies in the
<br>economy that precipitated the crisis, but that part of
<br>Pakistan's problems were the result of exogenous factors,
<br>such as rapid increases in world oil and fuel prices. They
<br>stressed the GOP had begun to correct structural deficiencies
<br>with "politically difficult" measures such as eliminating
<br>petroleum subsidies by year-end, putting in place targeted
<br>subsidies in place of broad economic subsidies, increasing
<br>the tax base, mandating net zero borrowing from the central
<br>bank on a quarterly basis, and increasing the pace of
<br>privatization. Finance Minister Qamar (who also serves as
<br>the Minister of Privatization) added that September will see
<br>a "flurry of activity" when new privatization projects are
<br>announced including a gas field. xxxxxxxxxxxx noted the GOP was
<br>undertaking a program of stringent fiscal restraint,
<br>including steps to elimin
<br>ate fuel and electricity subsidies.
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) xxxxxxxxxxxx described Pakistan's current economic
<br>situation as a short- to medium-term challenge and said that
<br>Pakistan had good long-term growth potential. Both xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>and Finance Minister Qamar asked for U.S. assistance in
<br>seeking additional external financing from international
<br>financial institutions.
<br>
<br>Labor
<br>- - -
<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU) xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>opened the labor portion of the Economic Dialogue by
<br>highlighting the steps the GOP has taken to guarantee core
<br>labor rights and combat child and bonded labor. xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>emphasized that the GOP has ratified all eight core
<br>International Labor Organization (ILO) conventions,
<br>highlighted that Pakistan was the second country in South
<br>Asia to do so. He also stated that Pakistan has instituted a
<br>national bonded labor policy and is in the process of
<br>combining Pakistan's 74 separate pieces of labor legislation
<br>into five broad bills. xxxxxxxxxxxx claimed the GOP would
<br>strengthen oversight of the informal sector and institute new
<br>labor protection and labor inspections policies.
<br>
<br>¶9. (SBU) Turning to nationwide labor inspections, heavily
<br>regulated since 2003, xxxxxxxxxxxx reported that
<br>government and industry leaders recently met in Sialkot,
<br>Punjab to resolve outstanding issues and pave the way for the
<br>resumption of surprise labor inspections. xxxxxxxxxxxx recognized
<br>that labor inspections have been inadequate in the past but
<br>claimed that both the federal and provincial governments
<br>supported a timely resumption of inspections. Assistant
<br>Secretary Sullivan highlighted the importance the U.S. places
<br>on labor rights and conditions, particularly in trade
<br>relationships. He stressed that the U.S. was looking for
<br>labor inspections to be resumed quickly and continued to
<br>press for labor rights to be guaranteed for all Pakistani
<br>workers, including those in Export Processing Zones (EPZs)
<br>and other industries covered under the Emergency Services
<br>Maintenance Act (ESMA). Given the historic USG concerns
<br>about labor rights in the EPZs, the need for attention to
<br>labor rights in the context of the ROZs,
<br>and the latest news from the GOP on new labor-related
<br>developments (legal and enforcement-related), A/AUSTR
<br>Lilienfeld proposed that a DVC be held between USG and GOP
<br>experts to allow for a better common understanding of the
<br>
<br>Islamabad 00003010 003 of 008
<br>
<br>
<br>GOP's plans.
<br>
<br>Break out session: bilateral investment treaty (bit)
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) The BIT break-out session, which lasted over two
<br>hours, was productive and set a positive tone for possible
<br>resumption of negotiations. The two sides outlined our
<br>mutual understanding of where things left off in March 2006,
<br>i.e., the five central, unresolved issues. The USG sent
<br>strong signals that if negotiations were to resume, we should
<br>focus on the five unresolved issues alone and not address
<br>matters raised subsequent to our last negotiating round in
<br>¶2006. The Pakistanis signaled they would be amenable to
<br>picking up with these five issues but also may want to
<br>address the "shared understanding" as well as what they
<br>characterized as "loose ends" or "cross-cutting issues."
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) The USG noted that we provided the 2006 "shared
<br>understanding" to Pakistan before President Bush's trip, in
<br>hopes of persuading Pakistan to sign the BIT during the
<br>President's visit. We said we hoped that our discussion of
<br>the five remaining issues during any future negotiations
<br>would be sufficient to satisfy GOP concerns and that if the
<br>GOP was still going to insist on a shared understanding, we
<br>would have to consult with our interagency before providing a
<br>response.
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Notwithstanding that we had not yet established a
<br>solid starting point, the GOP expressed the desire to
<br>reconvene negotiations, preferably in Islamabad so as to
<br>allow their stakeholder agencies to take a more active role.
<br>They promised to pass the 2006 negotiated text to these
<br>agencies, most of whom were not present at the meeting. GOP
<br>Finance Secretary Farrukh Qayyum joined for a few minutes
<br>during the session, emphasizing that he hoped that talks
<br>would not again be suspended and appealed for "renewed
<br>sensitivity" from each side.
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) The tone of the breakout session was positive and
<br>equally good sidebars continued throughout the day. In our
<br>Joint Communique, we noted that the United States and
<br>Pakistan have a strong interest in resuming BIT negotiations
<br>and that our investment experts should meet as soon as
<br>possible to do so. The favorable initial working
<br>relationship and rapport that was forged during this breakout
<br>session should facilitate progress going forward.
<br>
<br>Intellectual property rights
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br>
<br>¶14. (SBU) Finance Secretary Farrakh Qayyum opined that
<br>Pakistan's IPR laws were fragmented prior to 2005. Since that
<br>time, the GOP has taken multiple steps to bring Pakistan in
<br>line with international IPR norms. Recognizing that
<br>challenges still remain, Secretary Qayyum reported that the
<br>GOP's midterm goal is to strengthen enforcement capacity.
<br>Acting Assistant USTR for South Asia Claudio Lilienfeld
<br>pointed out that the U.S. still has concerns over IPR
<br>legislation, highlighting U.S. displeasure over the lack of
<br>data protection legislation, despite previous GOP pledges to
<br>quickly enact relevant legislation. Director xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>of the Intellectual Property Organization (IPO) reported
<br>that legislation was currently with the Ministry of Health
<br>but stalled due to disagreements on data protection versus
<br>data exclusivity. U.S. participants singled out data
<br>protection and the protection of book publishing copyrights
<br>for future discussion. In response to the proposal raised by
<br>A/AUSTR Lilienfeld, both s
<br>ides agreed on the need to hold a DVC as soon as possible
<br>among USG and GOP stakeholders to discuss the draft data
<br>protection legislation.

<br>Islamabad 00003010 004 of 008
<br>
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) The session opened with an overview by the GOP of the
<br>energy situation in Pakistan. Noting that only ten percent of
<br>the sector is privatized, xxxxxxxxxxxx remarked that privatization is expected to
<br>be increased to 60 percent over the next ten years and that a
<br>40 percent increase in prices has recently been passed to the
<br>public. xxxxxxxxxxxx also vaguely highlighted other steps which
<br>the GOP is pursuing such as a new strategy to exploit
<br>indigenous resources in which the private sector will have a
<br>key role, passage of measures to allow electricity prices to
<br>fluctuate with market demands, as well as the development of
<br>a price strategy for the FATA to recover the full cost of
<br>electricity versus the current 98 percent loss. Stating that
<br>the GOP wants to add 16,000 megawatts by 2015 with USD 30
<br>billion of investment, xxxxxxxxxxxx noted this was approximately
<br>USD 3 billion per year, with 2 billion from the private
<br>sector and 1 billion from the public sector. He said Pakistan
<br>is planning road shows in the U.S. and Southeast Asia to
<br>secure these investments, with emphasis on coal and
<br>hydro-power development. xxxxxxxxxxxx noted that the GOP is in
<br>need of experts on legal issues and capacity building
<br>involved in Thar coal development and that all parties are
<br>very interested in re-energizing the bilateral energy
<br>dialogue with the U.S.
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) Assistant Secretary Sullivan said that everyone is
<br>facing energy challenges. He said that the BIT would boost
<br>investor confidence to bring in funding from the private
<br>sector for large scale projects. On the Iran pipeline,
<br>Sullivan noted that the U.S. does not support investment with
<br>Iran and also questioned whether the GOP could ensure that
<br>Iran is a reliable supplier. Sullivan also pointed out that
<br>the Siemens Westinghouse dispute, which has been in the
<br>judicial process for 10 years, does not build confidence with
<br>foreign investors who may be looking at potential
<br>opportunities in Pakistan. He emphasized the importance of
<br>arbitration moving quickly and that it was important to clear
<br>up the issue and put a transparent regime in place to avoid
<br>similar drawn-out disputes in the future. He also added the
<br>need to resolve late payments to Chevron, whose country
<br>manager the day before briefed the delegation that the
<br>company may leave Pakistan unless the issue is resolved.
<br>Noting that the U.S. is willin
<br>g to fund a comprehensive geological mapping survey which
<br>could be very beneficial for the domestic energy sector,
<br>Sullivan asked the GOP to move forward with approval of the
<br>U.S. Geological Survey offer. A/S Sullivan also pointed out
<br>that he is the U.S. co-chair on the International Energy
<br>Association board and was willing to reach out to them for
<br>expertise if the GOP is interested.
<br>
<br>Agricultural cooperation
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br>
<br>¶17. (SBU) Finance Minister Qamar described increasing
<br>agricultural production as low hanging fruit, pledging that
<br>agricultural development will be the "main thrust of economic
<br>growth in the short term" as the income stays in the rural
<br>areas, which serves to alleviate poverty. He advocated
<br>strengthening the U.S.-Pakistan agricultural relationship.
<br>Qamar reported that water utilization remains a constraint
<br>for increased agricultural capacity; 60 percent of Pakistan's
<br>irrigation water never reaches crops due to inadequate
<br>irrigation systems and technology. Due to water constraints
<br>that prevent more planting, xxxxxxxxxxxx opined that the integration of
<br>genetically modified seeds is critical to increasing
<br>agricultural productivity. He requested enhanced
<br>U.S.-Pakistan collaboration on biotechnology research,
<br>cooperative biosecurity training and assistance in improving
<br>Pakistan agricultural value chains, particularly the use of
<br>cold storage and cool chain techno
<br>logies and methods. Finance Secretary Qayyum also discussed
<br>more access to U.S. markets, noting their twelve year effort
<br>to ship mangoes to the U.S. The Agricultural Counselor
<br>replied that once the Cobalt 60 arrives and the irradiation
<br>
<br>Islamabad 00003010 005 of 008
<br>
<br>
<br>facility is operating, USDA will restart the mango
<br>pre-shipment protocol. Also discussed were the ongoing
<br>negotiations to resolve differences over wheat import permit
<br>conditions so that U.S. commercial and food assistance wheat
<br>shipments to Pakistan could resume.
<br>
<br>Break out session: eliminating terrorism finance networks
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br>
<br>¶18. (C) Treasury Deputy Assistant Secretary Bob Dohner
<br>represented the U.S. in a break out session on eliminating
<br>terrorism finance networks. While Pakistan's anti-money
<br>laundering legislation and bulk cash interdiction programs
<br>were discussed, the majority of the breakout session focused
<br>on the UN 1267 committee and Pakistan's use of the People's
<br>Republic of China to block listings that reference Pakistan.
<br>Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) representatives including
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx reported that while Pakistan remains
<br>"fully committed" to the 1267 process, the GOP believes that
<br>the process has "several deficiencies." xxxxxxxxxxxx claimed
<br>that Pakistan's opposition to 1267 listings that mention
<br>Pakistan or Pakistani nationals was a domestic issue,
<br>claiming that evidence submitted to justify 1267 listings
<br>would not hold up in a court of law. xxxxxxxxxxxx reported that
<br>the GOP was reluctant to support such listings for fear that
<br>once the GOP froze assets of
<br>1267 listed entities, the government would be brought to
<br>court over the action. MFA and FIA representatives requested
<br>the U.S. share more intelligence on the individuals and
<br>entities in question. When asked whether Pakistan would
<br>prosecute if evidence were provided, xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>replied that "higher levels" would have to decide.
<br>
<br>¶19. (C)xxxxxxxxxxxx conceded that Pakistan's image was a
<br>motivation in blocking the listings, also reporting that
<br>supporting such listings "creates difficulties" for Pakistan.
<br>DAS Dohner responded that 1267 designations are not
<br>arbitrary and urged the GOP to ask the PRC to remove its
<br>holds on the listings in question. The breakout session
<br>concluded with both sides failing to come to an agreement on
<br>the issue.
<br>
<br>¶20. (C) State Bank of Pakistan Executive Director Jameel
<br>Ahmed reported that the Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance was
<br>still valid, the GOP planned to amend the legislation, taking
<br>into consideration recommendations put forth by Financial
<br>Action Task Force (FATF) members. The Ministry of Finance
<br>currently has the draft legislation and is reviewing the
<br>legality of the changes but plans to submit the bill to the
<br>Federal Cabinet for approval. No timeline was provided. The
<br>Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU) is reportedly functioning and
<br>submitting information of suspicious transactions to the FIA,
<br>Anti Narcotics Force (ANF) and National Accountability Bureau
<br>(NAB). Ahmed claimed that legislation aimed at interdicting
<br>cash smugglers was currently under review and being "hotly
<br>debated" by various GOP agencies.
<br>
<br>Gop scholarship proposal
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - -
<br>
<br>¶21. (SBU) The GOP also presented a scholarship proposal for
<br>U.S. consideration. Noting that the Higher Education
<br>Commission (HEC) has seen the number of degrees conferred
<br>triple as well as a significant increase of money (USD 2
<br>billion) into the sector, the GOP requested U.S. support to
<br>expand the "domestic brain pool for the future benefit of
<br>Pakistan." Stating that they would like to see fields of
<br>expertise tailored to the needs of the country, the GOP noted
<br>that 100 million Pakistanis are under the age of 25, so the
<br>need is great for higher education but currently only one in
<br>six high school graduates goes on to higher education. To
<br>provide more opportunities, the HEC proposed awarding 10,000
<br>scholarships over five years. Last year, 1,000 individuals
<br>were sent abroad, primarily in Europe. The details of the
<br>program and specific areas of concentration remain to be
<br>
<br>Islamabad 00003010 006 of 008
<br>
<br>
<br>worked out. Last year there were 100 Fulbright scholars and
<br>they would like to see this expanded to 1,000. A/S Sullivan
<br>noted that this co
<br>ncept could enhance long-term economic growth with graduates
<br>bringing back knowledge economy skills. He asked the
<br>Pakistani delegation to revise the proposal to include joint
<br>funding possibilities at which point he would share with the
<br>U.S. interagency.
<br>
<br>Reconstruction opportunity zones
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br>
<br>¶22. (C) Commerce Minister Shah said that his ministry would
<br>take the lead on Reconstruction Opportunity Zones (ROZ) for
<br>the GOP. He said that Pakistan would still like to see all
<br>textile products included in the list of products since this
<br>sector is the largest employment generator. He was concerned
<br>that currently only 50 percent of textile production is
<br>currently included. He said that the issue has been
<br>discussed with the Sarhad Development Authority and the
<br>Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP) Industrial Development
<br>Authority. The Finance Secretary pointed out that they have
<br>seen a lack of interest in ROZ's in the press and urged the
<br>U.S. to provide reassurance and more visibility on the
<br>subject.
<br>
<br>¶23. (C) A/S Sullivan noted that work is proceeding to promote
<br>the bill and September is the targeted timeframe for passage
<br>of the bill. He also said that we have worked to develop as
<br>broad as possible geographic territory for eligibility and
<br>expansive product lists, but full coverage for textiles was
<br>not possible given U.S. domestic concerns. A/S Sullivan
<br>said that the next steps on ROZ's were to internationalize
<br>the concept by approaching Japan, Canada and others to offer
<br>ROZ-like trade benefits, informing traditional and Pakistani
<br>investors on how to do business in the ROZs, addressing labor
<br>issues and prioritizing ROZ locations. For geographic areas
<br>not included in ROZs, A/S Sullivan recommended outreach to
<br>ensure businesses in those areas were taking full advantage
<br>of General System of Preferences (GSP) benefits.
<br>
<br>¶24. (C) The Secretary of Commerce responded that labor issues
<br>would not be a problem, he expected that there would be
<br>collective bargaining for Export Processing Zones (EPZs).
<br>A/AUSTR Lilienfeld said that national labor laws should apply
<br>in all locations including EPZs. A/USTR Lilienfeld said that
<br>a senior Commerce Ministry visit in September for the TIFA
<br>Council meeting would provide a timely opportunity for the
<br>GOP to engage with stakeholders in D.C. while ROZ legislation
<br>was under consideration on Capitol Hill.
<br>
<br>Foreign assistance and fata development
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br>
<br>¶25. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx stated that they wanted more input into USAID
<br>projects in the FATA. Mark Ward, Senior Deputy Assistant
<br>Administrator for Asia, noted that USAID continues to work
<br>closely with the FATA Secretariat and other local
<br>stakeholders to ensure decisions were made locally. USAID
<br>agreed to support the FATA Secretariat in improving
<br>communication with stakeholders in the capital but stressed
<br>the need for quick project implementation and visible
<br>progress, noting that delays can also be visible. A/S
<br>Sullivan noted the importance of country led efforts,
<br>accountability and USG efforts at improved coordination of G8
<br>donor activities. He also noted existing projects in the
<br>FATA that may be linked to implementation of Reconstruction
<br>Opportunity Zones. xxxxxxxxxxxx agreed with the need for greater
<br>coordination to avoid isolated, unlinked activities. xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>also requested budget support in lieu of project based
<br>assistance. USAID noted the capacity building needs f
<br>or GoP to adequately track and control funds.
<br>
<br>Regional cooperation and transit trade
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br>
<br>Islamabad 00003010 007 of 008
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶26. (C) On the issue of transit trade with Afghanistan,
<br>Commerce Secretary Shah noted that Pakistan saw a decline in
<br>overall exports to Afghanistan in 2006-2007 and were
<br>currently seeing Afghan restrictions on Pakistani exports of
<br>edible oil and carbonated soft drinks. Shah noted that
<br>Pakistan had received a draft transit trade agreement from
<br>the Government of Afghanistan and that the GOP had also
<br>delivered their own version to Afghan officials. He noted
<br>that the transit trade agreement would be discussed at the
<br>next session of the bilateral Joint Economic Council which is
<br>not yet scheduled. Shah noted that the GOP is concerned about
<br>the delays with Afghan reimbursement to Pakistanis who
<br>transit Afghanistan and explained that the GOA is charging
<br>ten percent of the value of Pakistani goods which transit
<br>Afghanistan en route to the Central Asian nations. Shah
<br>further commented that the GOP is currently not charging
<br>Afghanistan-bound goods the full port charges and are not
<br>inspecting the trucks en route to th
<br>e border.
<br>
<br>¶27. (C) To promote regional cooperation, Shah noted that
<br>Pakistan had been fully supportive of facilitating
<br>Afghanistan's entry into the South Asian Free Trade
<br>Association (SAFTA) and paid compensation as a developed
<br>country for the least developed countries in the SAFTA pact.
<br>Shah noted that trade among the SAFTA countries is up and
<br>that the next step in SAFTA was to complete the services
<br>agreements. Sullivan noted that increasing regional trade is
<br>the faster way to expand the local economy and linked the
<br>importance of expanding Pak-Afghan transit trade to greater
<br>trade within the region.

<br>¶28. (C) Qamar noted that Pakistan needs USD 110 billion in
<br>infrastructure development in the energy, mass transport and
<br>municipal services sectors. Feasibility studies and a
<br>sovereign guarantee fund are needed as well as funding from
<br>Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and the Export
<br>Import Bank in the form of grants. Qamar was hopeful that
<br>more public-private partnerships could be established which
<br>would be mutually beneficial to the U.S. and Pakistan and
<br>hoped to see greater private sector ties established before
<br>the next economic dialogue. A/S Sullivan noted the Senior
<br>Commercial Officer soon to be posted in Islamabad can assist
<br>those efforts and also highlighted the telemedicine project
<br>as a good example of cooperation. Droker emphasized the need
<br>for Pakistan to provide a transparent and predictable
<br>business climate to attract foreign investment.

<br>¶29. (C) In his closing remarks, Assistant Secretary Sullivan
<br>thanked Finance Minister Qamar for his leadership. He
<br>appreciated the candid discussion and underscored the
<br>importance of our economic relationship. He reemphasized the
<br>need to incorporate the FATA into the ROZ efforts and the
<br>need to restart the BIT negotiations. Finance Minister Qamar
<br>closed by saying that he felt great progress had been made
<br>during the day. He said that a matrix of actionable items
<br>would be good for follow through. He appreciated the open
<br>and frank discussions with a "good friend" on interwoven
<br>issues which he hoped lead to progress in those sectors and
<br>reemphasized that student scholarship recipients are the best
<br>ambassadors for the U.S. in Pakistan. Qamar noted that that
<br>there had been progress in moving forward on the BIT and
<br>suggested working out the differences "in coming days."
<br>Sullivan reiterated that the U.S. hoped to continue forums on
<br>Pakistan and have a broad based relationship with the new
<br>democratic government
<br>.
