<br>Summary
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) In a nod to President Medvedev's 2008 anti-corruption
<br>legislation, Transparency International's Corruption
<br>Perceptions Index ranked Russia at 146, up one spot from its
<br>2008 147th ranking.  This general lack of progress confirms
<br>what analysts have told us.  Corruption in Russia remains a
<br>serious problem, despite Medvedev's public denouncements and
<br>efforts to reduce it.  This presents a quandary for the GOR
<br>as it decides how to proceed.  Dramatic steps might threaten
<br>the status quo, yet gradual steps so far have been
<br>ineffective.  End Summary.
<br>
<br>-------------------------------------
<br>Russia's Corruption Rankings Stagnate
<br>-------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) Transparency International released its 2009
<br>Corruption Perceptions Index on 17 November.  Russia was
<br>ranked at 146 (it was ranked at 147 in 2008), which
<br>Transparency International said reflected a "mildly positive"
<br>response to Medvedev's 2008 anti-corruption legislation.
<br>Russia's 2009 rank, however, is still below its 2007 rank
<br>(143) and far below its 2006 rank (121).  These results echo
<br>the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators, with
<br>Russia's rankings on "control of corruption" showing a steady
<br>annual decline since 2005.
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) President Medvedev has repeatedly stated that
<br>corruption is endemic to Russia and has made fighting it a
<br>signature issue for his presidency.  He has highlighted
<br>consistently the damage corruption has done to Russia, most
<br>recently in both his high-profile "Forward Russia" article in
<br>September and his 12 November address to the Federal
<br>Assembly.  Beyond the anti-corruption legislation promulgated
<br>last year, however, few practical steps have been implemented.
<br>
<br>--------------------
<br>Elite Losing Control
<br>--------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C)  Furthermore, there is growing consensus among
<br>analysts that even if the power elite wants to tackle
<br>corruption, the economic crisis has exacerbated tendencies
<br>towards unmanageability of corruption within the power
<br>vertical.  XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX, told us that the GOR may have waited
<br>too long.  XXXXXXXXXXXX said that a few years ago, when only
<br>millions had been "stolen" from the Russian people (as
<br>opposed to today's billions), the GOR could have acted and
<br>not sparked public outrage.  XXXXXXXXXXXX said that the crisis had
<br>made the GOR's task more difficult and the scope of
<br>corruption has become unmanageable.  As the crisis reduced
<br>the size of the pot and the anti-corruption rhetoric
<br>increased, some Russians felt that they had best grab as much
<br>as they could while the going was good.  XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX, noted that the tendency of
<br>corruption to evade control by the GOR was not new.  In 2006
<br>-- at the height of Putin's control in a booming economy --
<br>it was rumored within the Presidential Administration that as
<br>many as 60 percent of his orders were not being followed.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---
<br>Do Changes At Interior Ministry Signal Progress?
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---
<br>
<br>¶5. (C)  XXXXXXXXXXXX noted that Minister of Interior Rashid
<br>Nurgaliev had recently fired or brought charges against a
<br>number of relatively low-ranking law enforcement officials
<br>for corruption.  XXXXXXXXXXXX stated though, that it was too soon to
<br>judge whether this activity reflected real change.  XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX, argued that Nurgaliev's actions were not
<br>meaningful.  He stated that action was required from higher
<br>up the power vertical and needed to affect the strata that
<br>average Russians would consider "untouchable".

<br>
<br>Can Russia's Trajectory Be Changed?
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX, said that only a "revolution" could change Russia's
<br>current trajectory.  He argued that the system had become too
<br>sclerotic and too beneficial for too many to allow for
<br>change. XXXXXXXXXXXX noted that corruption had even become a
<br>positive factor for a substantial portion of society.  By
<br>taking merit out of the equation for success, it was simply
<br>easier to pay for entrance to a university, for a contract,
<br>etc.  XXXXXXXXXXXX, who has made a fortune in Russia's
<br>casino business, told us forthrightly that the "levels of
<br>corruption in business were worse than we could imagine" and
<br>that, after working here for over 15 years and witnessing
<br>first-hand the behavior of GOR officials at all levels, he
<br>could not imagine the system changing.
<br>
<br>-------
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Corruption in Russia remains pervasive and
<br>deep-rooted.  While Medvedev's anti-corruption rhetoric is a
<br>step in the right direction, we have yet to see significant
<br>implementation of new measures.  Russians appear to accept
<br>current levels of corruption and seem inclined to pay up or
<br>emigrate, rather than protest.  Neither have Russians reacted
<br>to the sight of the connected few continuing to indulge in
<br>luxurious lifestyles as the economic recession continues to
<br>leave most Russians worse off than they were two to three
<br>years ago.  Nonetheless, the commentary on the GOR's
<br>increasing inability to manage the scope of corruption bodes
<br>ill for its stated effort to enhance corporate governance and
<br>investor confidence.
