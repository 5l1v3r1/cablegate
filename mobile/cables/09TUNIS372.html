<br>Classified By: Ambassador Robert F. Godec for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
<br> 
<br>------- 
<br>Summary 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX approached Ambassador and Pol/EconCouns 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX to share with us XXXXXXXXXXXX the Ambassador gave him assurances that we would. 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX shared a rare first-hand account of 
<br>corruption from several years ago in which Ben Ali himself 
<br>was described as asking for a 50 percent stake in 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX private university.  XXXXXXXXXXXX

<br>The Day I Realized Tunisia is No Longer a Free Country 
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) On the margins of a networking event for aspiring and 
<br>successful social entrepreneurs XXXXXXXXXXXX  The 
<br>book is extremely critical of the Ben Ali regime for, among 
<br>other things, the "duality" between official discourse and 
<br>the reality on the ground.  Specifically XXXXXXXXXXXX points 
<br>to the "stifling" of political liberties and "omnipotent" 
<br>controls on the media.  He also charges that freedom of 
<br>association is "illusory" and assesses that "the rule of law 
<br>is more fiction than reality."  XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br> 
<br>------------------- 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX 
<br>------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶3. XXXXXXXXXXXX asked that the US Embassy follow his case XXXXXXXXXXXX; 
<br>the Ambassador assured him that we 
<br>would do so.  Pol/EconCouns reviewed XXXXXXXXXXXX some of 
<br>the accounts of life in prison that we have heard from 
<br>released political prisoners; XXXXXXXXXXXX. 
<br> 
<br>---------------------- 
<br>Tale of Corruption I: 
<br>The French Connection? 
<br>---------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C/NF) Asked whether he had also been in touch with other 
<br>western embassies, XXXXXXXXXXXX said that he had not.  He had 
<br>avoided reaching out to the French, in particular, arguing 
<br>that Ambassador Degallaix is seen as Ben Ali's Ambassador to 
<br>French President Sarkozy, not vice versa.  In addition, 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX alleged that the GOT has improperly given 
<br>Ambassador Degallaix a villa, which is registered in his 
<br>daughter's name, on rue Sidi Dhrif, near the President's own 
<br>residence.  He did not offer any evidence of this alleged 
<br>corruption or explain how this knowledge came to him. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br>Tale of Corruption II: 
<br>Ben Ali Seeks 50 Percent Stake XXXXXXXXXXXX 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX likened corruption to a dangerous cancer 
<br>that is spreading in Tunisia, spurred on by the corrupt 
<br>practices of President Ben Ali and his extended family.  When 
<br>Pol/EconCouns responded by noting that most tales of 
<br>corruption that we hear concern "The Family" rather than the 
<br>President himself, XXXXXXXXXXXX recounted an incident in which 
<br>Ben Ali himself was involved.  XXXXXXXXXXXX Ben Ali came off as "very 
<br>uneducated" in the meeting, failing to grasp some of the key 
<br>points XXXXXXXXXXXX about the virtues XXXXXXXXXXXX Ben Ali abruptly told him that 
<br>he wanted a 50-50 stake in the enterprise.  Fearful of 
<br>responding in the negative, XXXXXXXXXXXX said he "played dumb," 
<br>pretending not to understand the President's proposition. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>Other Run-ins with "The Family" 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX also reviewed the difficulties that lead to 
<br>the closure XXXXXXXXXXXX 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>How Suha Arafat Got Into Trouble 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX also offered a theory as to what was behind 
<br>the GOT's decision to revoke Suha Arafat's Tunisian 
<br>citizenship in 2007.  (Note:  Reftel also reports on this 
<br>incident.)  He said that he had heard that Leila Ben Ali at 
<br>that time had been scheming to marry off an 18 year-old niece 
<br>(NFI) to UAE Prime Minister and Dubai Ruler Sheik Mohamed bin 
<br>Rashid al-Maktoum, one of whose wives is the half-sister of 
<br>the King of Jordan.  According to this rumor, Suha Arafat 
<br>warned Jordanian Queen Rania about Leila Ben Ali's plans. 
<br>Word of Arafat's intervention got back to the Tunisian First 
<br>Lady, who turned against Arafat and soon forced her out of 
<br>Tunisia. 
<br>

<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX

<br> 
<br>¶8. XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br> 
<br>------- 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX is extremely well respected and considered 
<br>an upstanding member of the community.  While we might doubt 
<br>the veracity of some of the rumors that he shared with us, we 
<br>have no reason to doubt his account of his conversation with 
<br>President Ben Ali, in which he described the President as 
<br>seeking a 50 percent stake in his private university.  We 
<br>routinely hear allegations of corruption, and such 
<br>allegations are inherently difficult to prove.  
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX anecdote strikes us as credible.  It is also 
<br>significant in that it implicates Ben Ali himself, while so 
<br>many other reported incidents of corruption involve his 
<br>extended family. 
<br>
