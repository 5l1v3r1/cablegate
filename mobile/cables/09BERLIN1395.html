<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Just hours after Chancellor Merkel's historic 
<br>November 3 address to a joint session of Congress, General 
<br>Motors (GM) canceled its sale of Opel to Canadian auto parts 
<br>manufacturer Magna.  The decision, which followed repeated 
<br>assurances from GM that it was a done deal, came as a 
<br>complete shock in Germany and dominated media coverage 
<br>throughout the day.  Merkel herself was reportedly highly 
<br>upset over GM's flip flop.  Ulrich Wilhelm, the Chancellor's 
<br>spokesman on Opel said the German government "regretted" the 
<br>decision, and reminded GM that it must now repay Berlin's 1.5 
<br>billion bridge loan to Opel by the end of the month, while 
<br>FDP Economics Minister Rainer Bruederle described GM's action 
<br>as "totally unacceptable."  The cabinet was expected to 
<br>discuss the GM move on November 4. Opel's labor unions, which 
<br>had strongly backed the Magna sale because of its promise to 
<br>save jobs and keep plants open, announced that workers would 
<br>withdraw all concessions made under the terms of the Magna 
<br>deal and sta 
<br>rt a general strike at Opel plants on November 5.  While 
<br>anger is widespread, there are already some voices outside 
<br>the government advocating acceptance of GM's announcement as 
<br>the only viable alternative to a total collapse of Opel.  End 
<br>Summary. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Germany's Political Establishment Reacts with Anger 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) Opinion across the political spectrum has been 
<br>uniformly negative.  FDP Economics Minister Rainer Bruederle 
<br>blasted GM's behavior as "totally unacceptable."  Juergen 
<br>Ruettgers, Minister President of Nordrhein Westfallen (CDU), 
<br>asserted that GM's decision showed "the ugly face of turbo 
<br>capitalism." 
<br>The leadership of the FDP, whose opposition to government 
<br>intervention in the Opel deal is well known, joined in the 
<br>condemnation of GM.  A high-level source indicated that 
<br>Chancellor Merkel is furious over the GM move and refuses to 
<br>talk to GM's leadership.  It is likely to be only a matter of 
<br>time before critics will call Merkel herself into account for 
<br>her strong support of the 
<br>now collapsed Magna deal.  The Cabinet has been called into 
<br>session and is likely to confirm the withdrawal of all 
<br>financial support and a demand that GM repay the government's 
<br>1.5 billion Euro bridge loan by the end of the month. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) Jochen Homann, the Economic Ministry State Secretary 
<br>heading the German interagency working group on Opel, told 
<br>EMIN on November 4 that there was no possibility of further 
<br>German financial assistance to Opel in the foreseeable 
<br>future.  The failure of the Magna deal and GM's reputation as 
<br>"an unreliable partner" would likewise complicate 
<br>negotiations with other governments seeking to preserve Opel 
<br>jobs and factories.  Although no one directly blamed the USG, 
<br>the Germans are still having trouble understanding how GM 
<br>could act independently of Washington.  Dr. Schubert, one of 
<br>Homann's lieutenants, complained to the Embassy that "if the 
<br>U.S. Government had GM under better control, this would not 
<br>have happened."  It is now up to GM, he said, to submit a new 
<br>restructuring and financing plan, as their previous one is 
<br>out of date.  Schubert was adamant that this time "there will 
<br>be no special treatment for Opel" and GM's plan would have to 
<br>go through normal channels. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Matched by Threats from Organized Labor 
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (SBU) Klaus Franz, the head of Opel's Works Council, 
<br>announced on November 4 that Opel's 25,000 employees in 
<br>Germany will begin an indefinite strike on November 5 to 
<br>protest the GM decision.  Franz called on all 55,000 Opel 
<br>workers across Europe to join in.  Accusing GM of 
<br>"blackmailing" governments and workers in Europe to sign on 
<br>to its "unacceptable" restructuring Plan, he also revoked 
<br>prior labor commitments to contribute 388 million dollars in 
<br>foregone benefits to the Magna sale.

<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) Oliver Burkhardt, head of the Metal Workers in NRW, 
<br>likewise condemned the decision as "bold and unfriendly," not 
<br>only to Opel employees, but to the German government. 
<br>However, Burkhardt conceded that he is waiting to see a long 
<br>term GM plan for Opel that relies on more than cost-cutting 
<br>and down-sizing.  In contrast to Klaus Franz, Burkhardt 
<br>contended that non-German labor unions were "elated" over the 
<br>failure of the Magna deal (which was tilted against workers 
<br>in other countries) and doubted they would heed Franz's 
<br>strike call.  He also predicted that the strikes in Germany 
<br>will be short-term and largely symbolic rather than actual 
<br>closures, adding "we are not going to close the door on a 
<br>solution with GM."  Similarly, Fred Irwin - Citigroup's 
<br>country manager in Germany and the Chair of the Opel Trust 
<br>that oversaw the Magna negotiations - predicted that unions 
<br>will eventually reconcile with GM once they realize there is 
<br>no other choice. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>While Despair Permeates Opel Executives 
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (C) Opel managers such as Berlin Representative Uwe 
<br>Berlinghoff, who almost uniformly favored the Magna contract, 
<br>were also "taken completely by surprise" by the GM 
<br>announcement.  Berlinghoff now expects GM to resurrect its 
<br>pre-Magna restructuring plans, including closure of plants at 
<br>Bochum (and Antwerp, Belgium) and the sale or closure of the 
<br>Eisenach plant.  Berlinghoff also expected the German 
<br>government to cancel the expected 4.5 billion dollar loan 
<br>guarantee package, as "GM has demonstrated its lack of 
<br>credibility with German politicians." 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Research and Development and IPR Could be Key 
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) German auto industry insiders have privately 
<br>identified compelling reasons why GM cancelled the Magna 
<br>deal.  Among these are the importance of the GM/Opel Research 
<br>and Development facility in Ruesselsheim and its patents to 
<br>GM's development of small efficient cars in Europe, the U.S. 
<br>and elsewhere.   GM was also reportedly skeptical that it 
<br>could adequately protect crucial IPR from Russian 
<br>exploitation because of the Sberbank/Gaz partnership with 
<br>Magna.  Moreover, Magna had oversold its ability to penetrate 
<br>the Russian market.  GM's announcement stressed its plans to 
<br>build on its already significant business in Russia while 
<br>retaining Opel and to work closely with Gaz without a Magna 
<br>partnership. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>But Auto Leader Welcomes the Move 
<br>--------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (C) Dr. Norbert Reithofer, the CEO of BMW, told the 
<br>Ambassador on November 4 that GM's move would be welcomed by 
<br>the German auto industry.  Reithofer was adamant that there 
<br>was no way BMW and the other German auto manufacturers would 
<br>have purchased auto parts from Magna once it became a direct 
<br>competitor as an auto manufacturer.  In Reithofer's view, 
<br>Magna made the Opel purchase proposal in a moment of panic at 
<br>the height of the economic crisis, but now that a recovery is 
<br>in the offing, probably is not unhappy to see it dissolve. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C) Despite the considerable German ire aimed at GM, much 
<br>of it is aimed at GM's handling of Opel (in particular the 
<br>timing of the November 3 announcement), rather than its 
<br>business rationale for retaining its German subsidiary. 
<br>Thoughtful German opinion leaders, including former Economics 
<br>Minister zu Guttenberg conservatives in the German business 
<br>community, were equally critical of Berlin's strong arm 
<br>lobbying on behalf of Magna.  An Opel Trust Board Member and 
<br>FDP politician Dirk Pfeil has already issued a statement 
<br>urging Berlin to provide 3 billion Euro in state aid to keep 
<br>GM afloat.  Like it or not, the German governments will need 
<br>to seek an accommodation with GM to keep Opel alive.
