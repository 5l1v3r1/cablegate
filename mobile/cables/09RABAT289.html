<br>Classified By: PolCouns Craig Karp for Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) Summary: Morocco broke diplomatic relations with 
<br>Iran and began a campaign against its domestic Shi'a minority 
<br>at Saudi Arabian instigation, according to XXXXXXXXXXXX.
<br>According to XXXXXXXXXXXX, Tehran had been using Morocco
<br>and its Embassy in Rabat for activities in Mali and Senegal. Domestically, XXXXXXXXXXXX emphasized that the anti-Shi'a campaign was aimed at neutralizing possible challenges to monarchist parties by Islamic groups in upcoming municipal elections. In addition, King Mohammed VI was seeking to reassert his position as a religious leader. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) Morocco broke relations with Iran and began a 
<br>campaign against its domestic Shi'a minority at Saudi Arabian 
<br>instigation, XXXXXXXXXXXX told PolOff on March 30.
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX was aware his comments would be reported.
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX said there was almost daily contact between Mohammed VI's palace and Riyadh in the run up to the surprise March 6 severing of Moroccan relations with Iran (Ref A-D); and the intense consultations have continued (Note: He did not provide a source or basis for this comment other than to say "our information shows." 
<br>End Note.). XXXXXXXXXXXX believes that Saudi Arabia has 
<br>enlisted King Mohammed VI personally (and not the Government 
<br>of Morocco, which was as surprised as the rest of the world 
<br>at the rupture, XXXXXXXXXXXX noted) in its geopolitical strategy 
<br>to counter Iranian influence. In return for active Moroccan 
<br>support, Saudi Arabia will ensure a continued flow of 
<br>subsidized oil to Morocco, and may plug holes in Morocco's 
<br>foreign direct investment balance sheet resulting from recent 
<br>Gulf withdrawals from major projects as a result of the 
<br>global financial crisis. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) XXXXXXXXXXXX said goading Iran, a country
<br>with which it had limited economic interests, and demonizing the Shi'a, a powerless minority group, was a small price for Morocco to 
<br>pay for a strategy that could have major payoffs. He added 
<br>that the King was "killing several birds with one stone" with 
<br>his actions, and was also seeking to reassert his position as 
<br>Commander of the Faithful (Note: Supreme religious leader for 
<br>the Moroccan Malachite branch of Sunni Islam. End Note.). 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) According to XXXXXXXXXXXX, Iran has sought
<br>to increase the influence of Shi'ism in West Africa, where Tehran had 
<br>been using Morocco (which is a regional air hub) and its 
<br>Embassy in Rabat as a jumping off point for activities in 
<br>Mali and Senegal. A former Iranian ambassador was also 
<br>apparently travelling to Tangier, Tetouan and other cities in 
<br>Morocco to lecture and identify promising young religious 
<br>students from the Shi'a community for familiarization visits 
<br>to, and further training in, Iran. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) Mohammed VI apparently saw this as a personal 
<br>affront to him and a direct challenge to his religious and 
<br>economic authority. (Note: Contributions from the wealthy 
<br>Tijani sect in Senegal and Mali augment Palace coffers. Many 
<br>Muslims in West Africa look to the Moroccan Monarch as their 
<br>religious leader. End Note). Although XXXXXXXXXXXX did
<br>not provide any basis for the supposition, XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>said XXXXXXXXXXXX believed that Mohammed VI had
<br>probably been planning his move for at least 
<br>a year. XXXXXXXXXXXX also speculated that the Palace was also 
<br>worried about the prospect of Moroccan foreign fighters 
<br>returning from Iraq, possibly having been recruited and 
<br>trained by Iran, and slipping into Iranian networks in 
<br>Morocco. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) Domestically, XXXXXXXXXXXX emphasized that the 
<br>anti-Shi'a campaign was also directed at dissident Islamic 
<br>group Adl Wa Ihsane (The Justice and Good Works Organization) 
<br>which has recently signaled its desire to become a legitimate 
<br>political party. The group, which has at times called for 
<br>the abolishment of the monarchy and the establishment of an 
<br>Islamic republic, is believed to have wide popularity among 
<br>poor and middle class populations unhappy with the political 
<br>system, which they view as corrupt. XXXXXXXXXXXX said
<br>that the Palace is trying to be "more conservative than the 
<br>fundamentalists" in a bid to neutralize their drawing power. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S/NF) On the Doha conference (Ref E and F), XXXXXXXXXXXX said 
<br>
<br>RABAT 00000289 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>the King's dithering about whether he would or would not 
<br>attend was a sign of the difficult balancing act he was 
<br>attempting to carry off by keeping Saudi Arabia happy, while 
<br>not alienating Qatar. XXXXXXXXXXXX said that by sending his 
<br>brother Moulay Rachid to the summit, despite his own last 
<br>minute withdrawal, Mohammed VI showed respect to the Qataris 
<br>while not enthusiastically endorsing their leadership bid. 
<br>Had he sent someone of lower stature, such as the Prime 
<br>Minister, it might have been read as a snub, XXXXXXXXXXXX 
<br>explained. (Comment: We agree.)
