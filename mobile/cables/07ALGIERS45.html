<br>SUBJECT: SENATE PRESIDENT RE-ELECTED 
<br>
<br>REF: A. 2006 ALGIERS 2067 
<br>
<br>¶B. ALGIERS 30 
<br>
<br>Classified By: DCM Thomas F. Daughton; reasons 1.4 b/d 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Abdelkader Bensalah was re-elected, 129-0, as the 
<br>President of the Conseil de la Nation (Senate) on January 12. 
<br>Bensalah remains first in line to succeed President 
<br>Bouteflika in the event that he is unable to complete his 
<br>current term. Bensalah's re-election became a foregone 
<br>conclusion when no other senator challenged him for the post. 
<br>A reporter for French-language daily newspaper Liberte, 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX, who covered all aspects of the election, told 
<br>us the result was predetermined once President Bouteflika 
<br>signaled to the senators that he wanted Bensalah to retain 
<br>his position. XXXXXXXXXXXX said senators privately complained 
<br>that, out of respect to Bouteflika, no other candidates had 
<br>presented themselves. Many told her the election became a 
<br>formality rather than an exercise in democracy, which was a 
<br>shame in their view. 
<br>
<br>BOUTEFLIKA APPOINTS SENATORS OF HIS GENERATION 
<br>--------------------------------------------- - 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) On the day of the election, eight new senators joined 
<br>the Conseil de la Nation as part of the third of the 
<br>membership appointed directly by President Bouteflika (ref 
<br>A). All have one characteristic in common: they are 
<br>"moudjahidine," or veterans (like Bouteflika) of the war of 
<br>independence against France. According to XXXXXXXXXXXX, these 
<br>newly appointed senators, as members of the "revolutionary 
<br>family" and in a sense "siblings of President Bouteflika," 
<br>will be very loyal to him. Some senators quietly expressed 
<br>to her their frustration that the president did not reach out 
<br>to members of the younger generation who will need to lead 
<br>the country after Bouteflika and his generation pass from the 
<br>scene. 
<br>
<br>VACANT SEATS FOR DEPARTING MINISTERS? 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Bouteflika appointed just eight senators out of the 24 
<br>allotted to him this year. XXXXXXXXXXXX, a former senator 
<br>from the presidential tier, told us Bouteflika made a 
<br>conscious decision to leave 16 seats vacant for later 
<br>appointment. While it may be true that Bouteflika had not 
<br>yet made up his mind in some cases, XXXXXXXXXXXX thought it more likely that he wanted to keep some Senate seats in reserve 
<br>for ministers who are expected to be dismissed shortly from 
<br>the cabinet. XXXXXXXXXXXX said the number of vacant seats was a 
<br>good indicator that a cabinet shuffle was coming soon. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) COMMENT: Even though Bouteflika's illness is receding 
<br>in the minds of the public (thanks to television pictures of 
<br>an active president), the widely respected Bensalah is 
<br>considered able to manage the presidential succession process 
<br>should Bouteflika not be able to finish his term. XXXXXXXXXXXX 
<br>analysis of the vacant Senate seats also strikes us as on the 
<br>mark.
