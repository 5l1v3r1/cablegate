<br>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR THE PRESIDENT'S TRIP TO OTTAWA
<br>
<br>Classified By: Charge d'Affaires Terry A. Breese, reason 1.4 (d)
<br>
<br>¶1.  (C)  Mr. President, Mission Canada warmly welcomes you
<br>and the First Lady to Ottawa.  We and Canadians alike are
<br>thrilled that your first foreign trip as President will be to
<br>Canada, which Canadians claim as a long-standing tradition
<br>reflecting the vital importance of this bilateral
<br>relationship between two democratic neighbors.
<br>
<br>SOME HOME TRUTHS
<br>----------------
<br>
<br>¶2.  (C)  Your enormous popularity among Canadians (an 81 pct
<br>approval rating) is to Conservative Prime Minister Stephen
<br>Harper both a blessing -- because he can for the first time
<br>since taking office in 2006 gain politically from public and
<br>policy association with the U.S. President -- and a curse --
<br>because no Canadian politician of any stripe is nearly as
<br>popular, respected, or inspiring as you are to Canadian
<br>voters, a genuine factor in the historically low turnout in
<br>the October 2008 Canadian federal election.  Many Canadians,
<br>especially university students, volunteered on your campaign,
<br>and busloads traveled to Washington for your inauguration.
<br>
<br>¶3.  (C)  Your decision to make Ottawa your first foreign
<br>destination as President will do much to diminish --
<br>temporarily, at least -- Canada's habitual inferiority
<br>complex vis-a-vis the U.S. and its chronic but accurate
<br>complaint that the U.S. pays far less attention to Canada
<br>than Canada does to us.
<br>
<br>¶4.  (C)  The minority status in Parliament of Harper's
<br>Conservative Party means that it and all other parties now
<br>remain in almost permanent campaign mode; there have been
<br>three successive minority governments (one Liberal, two
<br>Conservative).  The bottom line questions remain when the
<br>government will fall and on what issue.  Your trip will help
<br>to ensure that the government will survive an early February
<br>vote of confidence on the federal budget, in which Canada
<br>will post its first deficit in more than a decade as it
<br>provides a stimulus package of $30-40 billion.
<br>
<br>¶5.  (C)  The U.S. and Canada enjoy the world's largest
<br>trading relationship, with more than $1.5 billion in two-way
<br>trade crossing the border each day, including 77 pct of all
<br>Canadian exports.  With the border central to Canada's
<br>economic well being, Canadians chafe about what they see as a
<br>"thickening of the border" caused by U.S. actions to
<br>strengthen homeland security since 9/11.  Canadians claim
<br>that these measures have driven up business costs and delayed
<br>border crossers.  The business and trade communities in the
<br>U.S. and Canada both believe that the "balance" between trade
<br>and security has been tilted too far toward security, and are
<br>hopeful that your administration will tilt that balance back.
<br>Canada may argue for a new mechanism (separate from the
<br>trilateral Security and Prosperity Partnership) to address
<br>bilateral concerns.
<br>
<br>¶6.  (C)  Canadians wish that more Americans would recognize
<br>that Canada is the largest source of imported energy for the
<br>U.S. (including for both oil and natural gas), although there
<br>is also keen sensitivity over the higher environmental
<br>footprint of oil from western Canada's oil sands and concern
<br>about the implications for Canada of your energetic calls to
<br>develop renewable energies and reduce our reliance on
<br>imported oil.  Canada is also rich in hydroelectric power,
<br>has similar objectives for developing renewables, and is
<br>working strenuously to improve the environmental impact of
<br>production from the oil sands and to expand its own wind
<br>Qproduction from the oil sands and to expand its own wind
<br>power capacity.
<br>
<br>¶7.  (C)  Given the high integration of our two economies,
<br>Canada will hope for a truly North American discussion of
<br>economic stimulus, job creation, and sectoral support, as in
<br>coordinated bilateral measures on the auto sector (for which
<br>Canada promised a $3.4 billion assistance plan -- 20 pct of
<br>what the U.S. offered, matching a pledge that PM Harper made
<br>to then-President Bush in December) and in the G-20
<br>commitments on financial sector regulation.  We should ensure
<br>that both nations continue to design complementary packages
<br>to revive our economies.
<br>
<br>¶8.  (C)  Although the climate change issue has largely been
<br>the province of the official opposition Liberal Party, the
<br>Conservative government now seeks to set in place measures to
<br>reduce greenhouse gas emissions and advocates a coordinated
<br>policy with the U.S. on expanded efforts to protect our
<br>shared environment.  They hope and expect this will be a
<br>central theme of your visit.
<br>
<br>OTTAWA 00000064  002 OF 002
<br>
<br>¶9.  (C)  Arctic sovereignty is a motherhood-and-apple-pie
<br>issue for Canadians of all political persuasions, and they
<br>are deeply suspicious of assertions by the U.S. (and most
<br>other concerned nations) that the Northwest Passage is a
<br>strait for international navigation, not Canada's territorial
<br>sea.  The new Arctic policy issued at the end of the Bush
<br>Administration, which reasserted our views on the Northwest
<br>Passage and emphasized cooperation among Arctic nations, has
<br>re-ignited these suspicions.
<br>
<br>¶10.  (C)  Canada declined to join the U.S. in the invasion of
<br>Iraq and instead concentrated its global counterterrorism
<br>efforts on Afghanistan, including 2500  troops in Kandahar
<br>Province and its largest bilateral donor program worldwide.
<br>With the highest casualty rate among NATO partners and only
<br>about 65,000 Canadian Forces overall, there is virtually zero
<br>willingness across the Canadian political spectrum to extend
<br>the current Parliamentary mandate for these forces in
<br>Afghanistan beyond 2011, but Canada could offer up
<br>significant new funding to strengthen the Afghan National
<br>Army and Afghan National Police.  Much will depend upon
<br>convincing Canada that its continued contributions to the
<br>Afghanistan effort are a critical component of your strategy
<br>for success in Afghanistan.
<br>
<br>¶11.  (C)  No matter which political party forms the Canadian
<br>government during your Administration, Canada will remain one
<br>of our staunchest and most like-minded of allies, our largest
<br>trading and energy partner, and our most reliable neighbor
<br>and friend.
<br>
<br>KEY THEMES
<br>----------
<br>
<br>¶12.  (SBU)  In your public remarks and media availability,
<br>these points would be most useful from Mission Canada's
<br>perspective:
<br>
<br>--  Canada is a true friend, trusted ally, valued trading
<br>partner, and democratic model for the world;
<br>--  around the world, the U.S. and Canada are working
<br>together to defeat terrorism, promote economic development
<br>through trade and investment, prevent the proliferation of
<br>weapons of mass destruction, and advance the cause of human
<br>freedom and dignity;
<br>--  Canada and the U.S. are blessed to share the beauties and
<br>riches of North America, and will strive individually and
<br>jointly to protect and preserve its environment, while
<br>ensuring that our nations and the world benefit from its
<br>extensive natural and human resources;
<br>--  our highly integrated economies are now facing enormous
<br>challenges, but with our traditional resilience, creativity,
<br>sacrifice, and cooperation, our two countries will emerge
<br>from this crisis stronger than ever;
<br>--  while we share the prosperity that comes with the world's
<br>largest bilateral trade relationship, we also share the
<br>threats to that prosperity from international terrorism;
<br>--  21st century technology can help ensure ever more safe
<br>and efficient transit of goods and people across this longest
<br>undefended border in the world, and we need to work together
<br>more fully to understand each other's security and trade
<br>needs and to build a shared vision for the security of our
<br>two nations from new threats while investing in technology
<br>and infrastructure that can secure, support, and expand the
<br>benefits of our trade;
<br>--  the U.S. and Canada maintain extensive cooperation in the
<br>Arctic.  The U.S. views the Northwest Passage as a strait
<br>used for international navigation -- not Canada's territorial
<br>sea -- but does not dispute Canada's sovereignty over its
<br>Arctic islands;
<br>--  Canada has paid a disproportionately high price in human
<br>Q--  Canada has paid a disproportionately high price in human
<br>life to help the people of Afghanistan emerge from their dark
<br>era under the Taliban, and the U.S. salutes these Canadian
<br>contributions to the building of a democratic and successful
<br>society in that troubled land and counts on continued
<br>Canadian cooperation to achieve this goal;
<br>--  U.S. Presidents and Canadian Prime Ministers come and go,
<br>but our shared values and aspirations will continue to
<br>underpin a robust, mutually respectful, and hugely successful
<br>friendship and partnership that benefits not only our two
<br>peoples but the world.
