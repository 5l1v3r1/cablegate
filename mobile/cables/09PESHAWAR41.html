<br>SUBJECT: SECURITY ENVIRONMENT PROFILE QUESTIONNAIRE (SEPQ)-PESHAWAR 
<br>
<br>REF: STATE 33533 
<br>
<br>CLASSIFIED BY: David J. Hazarian, Regional Security Officer, 
<br>RSO, State. 
<br>REASON: 1.4 (d) 
<br>
<br>The following responses are provided for the Security 
<br>Environment Profile Questionnaire (SEPQ) Responses are keyed to 
<br>questions in Reftel. 
<br>
<br>(U) Demonstrations 
<br>
<br>¶A. Yes. There are numerous religious communities and 
<br>organizations within the NWFP and FATA, including a high volume 
<br>of violent Islamist islamaci radical groups that are fully 
<br>capable of carrying out anti-American demonstrations. In 
<br>addition, political parties, at times, include anti-American 
<br>sentiments in their demonstrations on domestic political issues. 
<br>
<br>i. In Peshawar, YES. There were eleven medium to large 
<br>demonstrations following Friday prayers relating to counter 
<br>terrorism efforts in the Tribal areas. There was also one large 
<br>demonstration where locals were protesting against the NATO 
<br>supply shipments transiting Peshawar onward to Afghanistan. 
<br>
<br>ii. No, Consulate Peshawar is located within the confines of a 
<br>Military cantonment and is marginally insulated from 
<br>demonstrations. 
<br>
<br>iii. The one demonstration stated in (Ai), consisted of 
<br>approximately 3,500 individuals. 
<br>
<br>iv. All three are possible. Pakistani military operations in the 
<br>FATA are perceived as initiated by the U.S. or policies viewed 
<br>by some as anti-Islamic are often blamed on U.S. influence. 
<br>
<br>¶B. Demonstrations are generally peaceful but have the 
<br>potential to become violent. 
<br>
<br>i. No 
<br>
<br>ii. No 
<br>
<br>¶C. Peshawar has not witnessed a large volume of Anti-Government 
<br>demonstrations over the past year. 
<br>
<br>i. No 
<br>
<br>ii. 250-700 
<br>
<br>iii. Demonstrations are generally peaceful but have the 
<br>potential to become violent. 
<br>
<br>iv. No 
<br>
<br>II. (S) Macro Conflict Conditions 
<br>
<br>¶A. Yes. Elements of the Taliban and Al-Qaida fighting in 
<br>Afghanistan use sites in the NWFP and the FATA for training, 
<br>rest, and recuperation. The Taliban have used the NWFP and the 
<br>FATA to stage attacks into Afghanistan and have also initiated 
<br>attacks on the Pakistan Military and Government in both the 
<br>Settled areas and the Tribal areas. Elements sympathetic to the 
<br>Taliban have attacked GOP buildings, officials, citizens and 
<br>Western-associated enterprises and personnel inside Peshawar, 
<br>often as retaliation for GOP efforts to stop Taliban and Al 
<br>Qaeda activities. The Pakistani Military has engaged in clashes 
<br>with Taliban elements inside the FATA and NWFP and local Police 
<br>have engaged with militants within the confines of downtown 
<br>Peshawar. The NWFP and the FATA have seen frequent instances of 
<br>sectarian violence between Shi'a and Sunni elements, most 
<br>notably in Peshawar (two bombings of Shi'a mosques in the Old 
<br>City during the Muharram Holiday); Sectarian violence has taken 
<br>place in Swat, Bannu, Kurram Tribal area and the NWFP's D.I. 
<br>Khan area. 
<br>
<br>¶B. The conflicts mentioned above have taken place mostly in the 
<br>FATA and NWFP to include the "settled areas", which are adjacent 
<br>to the FATA. Almost every FATA Agency has been effected by the 
<br>above mentioned conflicts. Heavily effected areas include Tank, 
<br>D.I. Khan, Bannu, Swat, Mohmand, Hangu and North and South 
<br>Waziristan. However, recently a significant number of attacks 
<br>have occurred in the settled areas. 
<br>
<br>¶C. U.S. Consulate Peshawar 
<br>
<br>¶D. Yes, the Taliban, Al Qaeda and extremist militants are 
<br>Anti-U.S. in nature and express this in their actions and 
<br>demonstrated capabilities. 
<br>
<br>III. (S) Host Country Capabilities 
<br>
<br>¶A. The Peshawar police are poor at deterring crime, and 
<br>responses to emergency calls by local citizens often go 
<br>unattended. The police have generally responded effectively to 
<br>Consulate Peshawar's requests when assistance has been needed. 
<br>The Police have limited resources, such as a shortage of 
<br>vehicles, and criminal lab facilities. Their police force is 
<br>geared toward security force work, i.e. protecting a street 
<br>corner, than investigative work or proactive procedures. As a 
<br>result of crime concerns a number of wealthier citizens in 
<br>Peshawar have hired contract security companies to provide armed 
<br>personnel at their residences. 
<br>
<br>¶B. The police forces in the NWFP have received significant 
<br>training and support from the U.S. State Department, Diplomatic 
<br>Security Anti-terrorism Training Assistance (ATA) Program and 
<br>the Department of Justice's International Criminal Investigative 
<br>Training Assistance Program (ICITAP). The training is first rate 
<br>but it has not had a major effect on police capabilities in the 
<br>province. Their ability to conduct effective investigations, 
<br>whether it be post-blast, homicide or kidnappings is extremely 
<br>limited. 
<br>
<br>¶C. Yes. Corruption tends to be wide spread and pervasive at all 
<br>ranks of law enforcement. There are also reports of high-level 
<br>corruption in the province. 
<br>
<br>¶D. Yes, Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) is 
<br>professional and capable of deterring terrorist actions. 
<br>However, they do face resource challenges which sometimes 
<br>affects their ability to effectively conduct counterterrorism 
<br>operations. 
<br>
<br>¶E. Yes, ISI for the most part, is cooperative with U.S. 
<br>Consulate requests for information and support. They are an 
<br>important U.S. ally in the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT). 
<br>However, there is a divided loyalty within ISI ranks which may 
<br>cause inaction, or assistance to Taliban and anti U.S. groups. 
<br>
<br>¶F. Yes. A number of Al-Qaeda and Taliban members have been 
<br>killed or apprehended. 
<br>
<br>¶G. Yes. Pakistani officials have been very responsive. At the 
<br>Consulate in Peshawar, we have a platoon of Capital City Police 
<br>and a platoon of Frontier Constabulary augmenting security at 
<br>the consulate. 
<br>
<br>¶H. The airport security is below-average. 
<br>
<br>¶I. The customs and immigration control at airports is adequate 
<br>but at border crossings along the border with Afghanistan and 
<br>Iran it is ineffective. 
<br>
<br>¶J. Ineffective, the borders are porous. Taliban and militant 
<br>extremists are constantly crossing the border with Afghanistan 
<br>and engaging in terrorist and smuggling activity. The rugged 
<br>terrain makes it difficult to patrol and control the border. 
<br>
<br>(6) (S) Indigenous Terrorism 
<br>
<br>¶I. (S) Anti-American Terrorist Groups 
<br>
<br>¶A. Yes-Pakistan has a significant number of Islamic extremist 
<br>militants. Jaish-i-Muhammad (banned by the GOP) aka 
<br>Khudam-ul-Islam, Lashkar-I-Tayyiba (banned by the GOP), 
<br>Jamaat-ul-Furqaan, Harakat ul-Jihad-I-Islami, Harakat 
<br>ul-Mujahideen aka Jamiat ul-Ansar, harakat ul-Mujahideen 
<br>al-Alami, Al-Badr Mujahideen, Hizbul Mujahideen, Harakat ul 
<br>Ansar, Lashkar I-Jhangvi (banned by the GOP), Sipah I-Sahaba 
<br>Pakistan (banned by the GOP), Hizb-e-Islami Khalis, Tehrik Nefaz 
<br>I-Shariat Muhammadi (banned by the GOP), Taliban and Al Qaeda. 
<br>
<br>¶B. In Peshawar, Yes, the killing of an Amcit USAID Contractor. 
<br>
<br>¶C. Yes, the attack of the Principal Officer. 
<br>
<br>¶D. Yes, see C. 
<br>
<br>¶E. See C-and there continues to be credible on-going reporting 
<br>by these groups to target U.S. interests and personnel. 
<br>
<br>¶F. They operate across the FATA and NWFP and inner city of 
<br>Peshawar. 
<br>
<br>¶G. U.S. Consulate Peshawar which is located in Peshawar. 
<br>
<br>II. Other Indigenous Terrorist Groups 
<br>
<br>¶A. In Peshawar, yes 
<br>
<br>¶B. Yes, there have been three diplomats kidnapped within 2-5 
<br>kilometers of Consulate residences; thirteen individual rocket 
<br>attacks which have impacted within 1-7 kilometers from the 
<br>Consulate and Consulate residential housing area; three large 
<br>IED attacks within 800 meters to 3 kilometers of the Consulate; 
<br>four shooting incidents between host nation police and militants 
<br>within 200 meters to 1.5 kilometers from the Consulate 
<br>residential housing area; seven infantry-style assaults 
<br>conducted by militants on NATO shipping terminals located 5-7 
<br>kilometers from the Consulate residential housing area ranging 
<br>from 50-275 militants used in these attacks and two 
<br>assassination attempts of Amcit personnel, resulting in the 
<br>death of a USAID Contractor and the unsuccessful 
<br>assisination/kidnapping attempt of the Principal Officer within 
<br>125-meters to 3 feet from the Consulate residential housing 
<br>area. Additionally, there have been 138 incidents of violent 
<br>crimes and kidnappings targeting locals which have occurred 
<br>within 2-3 kilometers of the Consulate and Consulate residential 
<br>housing area. 
<br>
<br>¶C. In Peshawar, yes. Indiscriminate attacks have occurred 
<br>directly in front of Consulate facilities/residences and as 
<br>close as 400 meters from the Consulate. On two separate 
<br>occasions USG personnel were specifically targeted, resulting in 
<br>the death of one USAID Contractor (see B). There have also been 
<br>sectarian violence aimed at specific groups i.e. Sunni, Shi'a 
<br>and there have also been numerous random attacks 
<br>indiscriminately targeting innocent civilians. 
<br>
<br>¶D. Yes, see-(B and C) 
<br>
<br>(7). (S) Transnational Terrorism 
<br>
<br>¶I. (S) Transnational Terrorist Indicators 
<br>
<br>¶A. Yes, Al Qaeda, Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), Islamic 
<br>Jihad Union, Peshawar is the birthplace of Al-Qaida and 
<br>continues to provide a safe haven for it's activities. 
<br>
<br>¶B. All 
<br>
<br>¶C. Officially no, however, sympathizers are suspected 
<br>throughout the GOP ranks. 
<br>
<br>¶D. Yes, some Islamic charities include al-Rashid Trust, 
<br>Al-Akhtar Trust, Idara, Khidmat-e-Khalq. Also, madrassas support 
<br>some of these groups. 
<br>
<br>¶E. Both Sunni and Shi'a with extremist views support these 
<br>groups. 
<br>
<br>¶F. The hostile third country intelligence services in Pakistan 
<br>include Russia, Iran, Cuba and China. There is no corroborated 
<br>information at this time to suggest that these intelligence 
<br>services are directly targeting U.S. interests in Pakistan or 
<br>are engaged in anti-American terrorist acts. 
<br>
<br>¶G. The availability of weapons and explosives is high in the 
<br>NWFP and FATA as well in neighboring Afghanistan with the border 
<br>area being so porous. On a routine basis, Pakistani security 
<br>forces and police are uncovering sizeable numbers of weapons and 
<br>explosives from suspected terrorist locations throught downtown 
<br>Peshawar, FATA and the NWFP.
