<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: Amid resurgence over the past two years of 
<br>politics dogged by nationalist rhetoric, some Bosniak 
<br>(Muslim) political actors have sought to portray themselves 
<br>as more capable of protecting Bosniak interests than their 
<br>opponents. One aspect of this tussle is an 
<br>increasingly-visible rift in the Bosniak community that 
<br>centers on what it means to be a "good" or "bad" Bosniak. 
<br>"Good Bosniaks," according to this sentiment, are those who 
<br>espouse conservative political and religious ideals. More 
<br>moderate and secular ideals are, by implication, held by "bad 
<br>Bosniaks." Statements from the Islamic Community, 
<br>particularly its leader, Reis Ceric, that label those who 
<br>criticize Islamic Community as "Islamophobic" have sharpened 
<br>this polarization among Bosniaks. Bosnia's 
<br>largest-circulation and most influential pro-Bosniak daily, 
<br>Dnevni Avaz, has also increasingly championed "good Bosniak" 
<br>causes and unscrupulously attacked Bosniaks and Bosniak 
<br>institutions (including a rival, more secular Bosniak daily) 
<br>that disagree with it. This press war, sparked largely by 
<br>Avaz's business interests, has helped the intra-Bosniak 
<br>debate gain traction more quickly and more broadly than it 
<br>might otherwise. Depending on the path the debate takes, it 
<br>has the potential, over the longer-term, to steer Bosniak 
<br>politics in a more conservative direction, which would 
<br>complicate efforts to forge the compromises among Bosniaks, 
<br>Serbs, and Croats necessary to secure Bosnia's future. END 
<br>SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>Protectors of Bosniak 
<br>--------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) In a time of international reluctance to engage 
<br>heavily in Bosnia -- coupled with Bosnian Serb and Croat 
<br>attempts to establish maximal autonomy for themselves -- 
<br>Bosniak fears of isolation and abandonment have escalated. 
<br>The perception of the risks to the Bosniak community among 
<br>average Bosniaks is genuine, grounded largely in the fact 
<br>that Bosniaks were the most aggrieved ethnic group during the 
<br>1992-95 war and that their plight was ignored by the 
<br>international community. Reflecting these fears, many 
<br>Bosniak political leaders over the past two years have 
<br>campaigned on the idea that they are better able to protect 
<br>Bosniak interests than their rivals. At the same time, they 
<br>have framed debate on specific policies within their Bosniak 
<br>constituency in existential terms. Bosniak member of the 
<br>Tri-Presidency Haris Silajdzic has been the Bosniak political 
<br>leader most willing to appeal to these fears -- in fact, he 
<br>has often deliberately stoked them -) but others, including 
<br>Party for Democratic Action President Sulejman Tihic and 
<br>Social Democratic Party leader Zlatko Lagumdzija at times 
<br>have also done so. 
<br>
<br>Reis Ceric Helps Mold Bosniak Identity 
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) At the same time, the Head of the Islamic Community, 
<br>Reis Ceric, has sought to promote a Bosniak political 
<br>identity rooted in "victimization." He has regularly 
<br>reminded Bosniaks that they are victims of genocide and that 
<br>they suffered more than any other group in the 1992-95 war. 
<br>In a Hayat TV interview on January 11, the Reis claimed that 
<br>following the break-up of the Ottoman Empire, Bosnian Muslims 
<br>had been variously subjected to "phobias" against Turkey, 
<br>Islam, and Bosnia itself. He also alleged that media 
<br>coverage of the alleged threat of Islamic terrorism in Bosnia 
<br>is, itself, motivated by "Islamophobic" media and "is, in a 
<br>way, a preparation for a new genocide on Bosniaks." The Reis 
<br>has, by all accounts, succumbed to the political fray, 
<br>criticizing or praising Bosniak leaders as he feels 
<br>appropriate. His public comments about Bosniak identity and 
<br>Bosniak suffering have clearly been aimed at shaping Bosniak 
<br>political discourse as well as the positions adopted by the 
<br>country's leading Bosniak political parties. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) The Reis has also sought to define Bosniak identity in 
<br>religious terms and has publicly implied that to be a "good 
<br>Bosniak" one must be a "good Muslim." He has supported 
<br>policies that are controversial among more secular Bosniaks, 
<br>such as introducing religious education into kindergarten 
<br>classes. Ceric has also made use of his public profile and 
<br>media access to attack critics of his agenda, often implying 
<br>that his position places him above criticism. In one 
<br>
<br>SARAJEVO 00000103 002.3 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>interview, Ceric claimed that while he personally welcomed 
<br>constructive criticism, criticism of Islam itself was 
<br>impermissible. (Note: Ceric clearly intends to be the sole 
<br>judge of when criticism of him or his administration becomes 
<br>a criticism of Islam. His past responses to other critics 
<br>inside and outside the Islamic Community suggest as much. 
<br>End Note.) 
<br>
<br>"Islamophobes" are Everywhere 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) The Islamic Community has increasingly condemned 
<br>attacks against itself as anti-Islamic, and as undermining 
<br>Bosniaks in Bosnia. A November op-ed in the Sarajevo-based 
<br>daily Oslobodjenje touched on some controversial projects 
<br>undertaken by the Islamic Community, particularly the Reis' 
<br>new offices -- now under construction -- which are rumored to 
<br>be extremely costly. The article also criticized the Reis, 
<br>as the head of the Islamic Community. In response, the 
<br>Islamic Community was quick to demonize its critics and imply 
<br>that their opposition made them "bad Bosniaks." An Islamic 
<br>Community statement declared the paper's stance to be, 
<br>"...nothing but a continuation of the genocidal politics 
<br>designed to wipe the BiH Muslim off the face of the Earth... 
<br>the Reis' office is very much surprised by the Islamophobic 
<br>editorial policy of Oslobodjenje." (Note: Ceric and the 
<br>Islamic Community may be using the "heavy artillery" of 
<br>insinuating Islamophobia to defend a weak spot, specifically, 
<br>the widespread perception that his administration has been 
<br>fiscally irresponsible. End Note.) 
<br>
<br>Santa Claus Didn't Come to Town 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) Even Bosniak children are not immune to political 
<br>efforts to shape the Bosniak identity. There has been a push 
<br>to introduce Islamic religious education in all 
<br>kindergartens, a move that one respected professor (known to 
<br>be an outspoken critic of the Reis) from the Faculty of 
<br>Islamic Sciences defined as a "crime against children." 
<br>Similarly, the director of Sarajevo's state-funded preschools 
<br>attempted to ban Djeda Mraz (Grandfather Frost) in 2007, 
<br>arguing that Sarajevo is predominantly Muslim and that Djeda 
<br>Mraz is not part of the Muslim tradition. (Note: Modeled on 
<br>Santa Claus, Djeda Mraz emerged in Yugoslavia after World War 
<br>II as a secular figure who gave gifts to children of all 
<br>religions. End Note) Secular-minded Sarajevo citizens saw the 
<br>snubbing of Djeda Mraz as an attempt to define for children 
<br>what it means to be "good" Muslims and organized protests and 
<br>petitions against the proposed ban. The outrage of Sarajevo 
<br>citizens was best captured in the editorial comment of FTV's 
<br>news program 60 Minutes. The show's host, Bakir 
<br>Hadziomerovic, characterized the director of the public 
<br>institution "Children of Sarajevo," Razija Mahmutovic, as the 
<br>fiercest opponent of Djeda Mraz. Taking on an ironic tone, 
<br>Hadziomerovic sarcastically proposed that Mahmutovic 
<br>introduce the figure of "Santa Alija," in reference to the 
<br>elder Izetbegovic. In both cases mentioned here (early 
<br>religious education and banning of Djeda Mraz), the secular 
<br>position lost out. 
<br>
<br>Popular Paper Religiously Pursues Bosniak Interests 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) The definition of a "good Bosniak" as one who is 
<br>politically and religiously conservative has also been 
<br>increasingly propagated by the country's largest-circulation, 
<br>pro-Bosniak daily, Dnevni Avaz. Over the past several 
<br>months, Fahrud Radoncic, owner of Avaz and its associated 
<br>businesses, has engaged in a crusade to "protect Bosniak 
<br>interests," primarily as part of an effort to undercut its 
<br>opponent, the more secular Oslobodjenje. While Avaz and 
<br>Oslobodjenje have had a long-running rivalry centered more on 
<br>business competition than ideology, Radoncic's recent 
<br>statements represent a clear raising of the stakes. In a TV 
<br>interview on November 30, Radoncic accused his opponents -- 
<br>including a number of media outlets -- of "destroying 
<br>Bosniaks" through attacks on, as he put it, the three key 
<br>pillars of Muslim faith in Bosnia: the Islamic Community and 
<br>Reis Ceric; the memory of Alija Izetbegovic, as personified 
<br>by his son Bakir; and Avaz itself. On December 30, Avaz 
<br>labeled Ceric a true representative of the Bosniak people, 
<br>adding "...those who attack Reis Ceric would like to see a 
<br>situation like before, when the state was appointing the Reis 
<br>
<br>SARAJEVO 00000103 003.2 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>so that he would listen to the state, thus destroying the 
<br>institution of Islam and the Islamic Community." 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Radoncic has also not shied away from exploiting his 
<br>position as owner to influence how Avaz presents issues. The 
<br>December 29 edition of Avaz carried a front page article that 
<br>slammed those who opposed the construction of a new 
<br>administrative building for the Islamic Community and 
<br>accusing them of seeking to put the Islamic Community under 
<br>their political control, to diminish its power, or to destroy 
<br>it. Avaz plainly misrepresented facts related to the 
<br>project, and made use of extensive purple prose in negatively 
<br>characterizing opposition to the project. The following day, 
<br>Avaz continued its offensive against "the enemies of Islam" 
<br>with a full-page interview with Enver Imamovic, a professor 
<br>of history at the Philosophy Faculty in Sarajevo. Imamovic 
<br>condemned public attacks against the Islamic Community and 
<br>Reis Ceric, declaring, "Let us not forget what the Islamic 
<br>Community meant to our people in the past war. This was the 
<br>institution around which Bosniak people gathered." 
<br>
<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) In an atmosphere of pessimism, created and fueled by a 
<br>lack of political or economic progress in the country, 
<br>insisting on the importance of being a proper Bosniak is 
<br>gaining momentum as a political tool. Lending credence to, 
<br>and most likely feeding, this discourse is increasingly 
<br>audacious nationalism among Bosnian Serbs and, to a lesser 
<br>extent, Bosnian Croats. A growing fear of isolation appears 
<br>to be providing fodder for political actors, which they can 
<br>exploit to urge Bosniaks to rally around their leadership and 
<br>agenda, which some politicians, the Reis and the opportunist 
<br>Radoncic, have sought to define in conservative and more 
<br>religious terms. Depending on how this debate plays out, 
<br>Bosniaks politics could take an increasingly conservative 
<br>political trajectory. The outcome of this intra-Bosniak 
<br>debate will likely take considerable time to play out, but 
<br>its outcome will almost certainly shape public perceptions of 
<br>who is fit to lead and to speak for Bosniaks, an ethnic group 
<br>whose sense of identity is still in flux. With all three 
<br>sides of the ethnic divide retreating to ethnic-based 
<br>politics, the prospects of compromises necessary for Bosnia's 
<br>future become much dimmer.
