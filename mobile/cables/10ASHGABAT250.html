<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Turkmenabat, Turkmenistan's second largest 
<br>city, continues its role as a transport hub and industrial 
<br>center, despite diminished regional commerce in the 
<br>post-Soviet era. A large complex that processes 
<br>locally-harvested licorice root continues to prosper due to 
<br>the availability of inputs and a healthy export market. A 
<br>machine parts factory has faced greater challenges, having 
<br>been forced to find a new product line and relying solely on 
<br>the domestic market. Unlike the licorice complex, which 
<br>pre-dates the Russian Revolution, the machine parts factory 
<br>was a Soviet creation that lacks an obvious market in 
<br>Turkmenistan's current economy. Thanks to government 
<br>subsidies, however, it does not appear that even a 
<br>struggling, Soviet era enterprise is threatened with closure. 
<br>Given its success at maintaining its production equipment, 
<br>the factory could see better days if it found the right 
<br>foreign partner interested in a low-cost metal parts. END 
<br>SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>LOCAL LICORICE ROOT SUPPORTS AN INDUSTRY 
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) Poloff recently visited the Buyan Turkmenabat 
<br>Agro-Industrial Complex, which specializes in the production 
<br>of licorice extract in dry and paste forms. The licorice 
<br>processing plant dates back to the Czarist era, when it was 
<br>started by the U.S. firm MacAndrews and Forbes in 1906. A 
<br>meeting with the director of the complex took place in the 
<br>administrative building, adjacent to the processing plant. 
<br>The plant was reportedly modernized in 2008 by a Chinese 
<br>company, although the original 1906 press is still in use. 
<br>The director of the complex declined poloff's request to tour 
<br>the plant, saying that the equipment was currently undergoing 
<br>maintenance prior to the start-up of the harvesting season in 
<br>March. Instead, he offered to describe the process used to 
<br>produce licorice extract, which is essentially a combination 
<br>of steam and pressure applied to the harvested roots. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) Licorice root grows wild along the banks of the Amu 
<br>Darya. Attempts to cultivate it have not been successful. 
<br>The licorice root is harvested by the Buyan complex's own 
<br>brigades. The harvest takes place between March and October, 
<br>terminating after the first frost. During the Soviet period, 
<br>the Buyan plant processed licorice root from Uzbekistan, 
<br>Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. Since the end of the 
<br>Soviet Union, the plant only processes licorice root 
<br>harvested in Turkmenistan. Buyan has 600 employees, the bulk 
<br>of whom work in its harvesting brigades. The company does 
<br>not obtain licorice root from individual harvesters. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) The Buyan complex processes and sells unprocessed 
<br>licorice root, as well as paste and powder extract. The 
<br>powder extract is a new, higher value-added product, 
<br>following modernization of the plant by the Chinese and 
<br>installation of new equipment. The equipment in the plant is 
<br>Chinese, Russian and American, the still operational 
<br>U.S.-built press dating back to the plant's founding more 
<br>than 100 years ago. Although the plant falls under the 
<br>control of the Ministry of Healthcare and Medical Industry, 
<br>it does not produce higher value-added consumer products such 
<br>as medicine or candy, which are the primarily end uses for 
<br>licorice extract. Buyan ships licorice extract to the U.S., 
<br>Japan, former USSR countries, China and Western Europe. The 
<br>U.S. company Mafco Worldwide Corp. purchases about 2,000 tons 
<br>of extract per annum, all of which is produced on the vintae 
<br>U.S. press, according to the director. Thirty percent of the 
<br>exports are licorice extract, with the remainder sent as 
<br>dried root. 
<br>
<br>MACHINE PARTS: WE'LL MAKE WHATEVER YOU NEED 
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) Poloff also visited an industrial machinery factory 
<br>in Turkmenabat named "Agromash," which was established in 
<br>¶1973. The plant is part of the state-owned 
<br>
<br>ASHGABAT 00000250 002.2 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>"Turkmenmashyngurlushyk" (Turkmen Machine Building) 
<br>Enterprise, which falls under the Ministry of Energy and 
<br>Industry. It is one of eleven such factories operated by the 
<br>machine building enterprise at different locations throughout 
<br>the country. The factory has mechanical and welding 
<br>sections, as well as a section for the reconstruction and 
<br>testing of Russian-built YaMZ diesel engines. Greeted by the 
<br>company's director, Muratjan Jumakulyiev, poloff was 
<br>immediately led to the Soviet-era plant's massive shop floor 
<br>in a soaring, hangar-like structure. The better part of the 
<br>shop floor was devoid of activity, although a handful of 
<br>workers were operating some of the equipment. The plant 
<br>remains fully equipped with Soviet-era machine tools such as 
<br>metal lathes and drills. An adjacent building houses a 
<br>foundry with two rows of furnaces for melting metal. 
<br>Although the factory has a capacity to produce 1,800 tons of 
<br>iron and steel castings per annum, and 250 tons of 
<br>non-ferrous metal castings, during the visit none of the 
<br>furnaces were operating. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) While the factory plant had once specialized in the 
<br>repair of road grading equipment, it no longer performs that 
<br>work and is now clearly scrambling for business for its line 
<br>of products. The factory can also fabricate custom-ordered 
<br>machine parts based on a client's specifications. Agromash's 
<br>product line includes clay mixing machinery for use on 
<br>drilling units; trailers that provide temporary housing and 
<br>offices on construction sites; circulation systems for the 
<br>preparation and storage of drilling solutions for oil and gas 
<br>wells; rototillers; and ironwork such as ornamental fences 
<br>and manhole covers. There was one massive circulation system 
<br>on site ready for shipment, and at least a dozen trailers 
<br>featuring various interior configurations. The factory 
<br>currently does not export its production, although it does 
<br>sell to foreign companies doing business in Turkmenistan. 
<br>The factory's director proposed that U.S. firms could order 
<br>custom machine parts and Agromash could produce them at a 
<br>fraction of the U.S. cost. He also thought the company's 
<br>housing/office trailers could find useful applications in 
<br>Afghanistan, 
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) COMMENT: The Buyan licorice complex clearly has a 
<br>longstanding market niche dating back to the early 20th 
<br>century. Even though the complex lost its regional role 
<br>following the break-up of the Soviet Union, its continued 
<br>exclusive access to its basic input, licorice root, and 
<br>well-developed export demand have provided it with continuity 
<br>and favorable prospects. Agromash, on the other hand, had to 
<br>find new lines of business in the post-Soviet Turkmen economy 
<br>and lacks the wherewithal to develop export markets. While 
<br>the factory did not look busy, it has managed to maintain its 
<br>equipment intact, thanks to state support, and could present 
<br>an opportunity for a foreign partner looking for a low-cost 
<br>supplier for machine parts. END COMMENT
