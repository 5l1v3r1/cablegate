<br>SIPDIS 
<br> 
<br>E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/16/2015 
<br>TAGS: PREL MASS PHUM ELAB IR IZ XF SA PK FR TC
<br>SUBJECT: MBZ ON IRAQ, IRAN, PAKISTAN 
<br> 
<br>REF: ABU DHABI 1008 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Michele J. Sison. 
<br>For reasons 1.4 (a), (b), and (d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (U) Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed,s weekly 
<br>Sunday "VIP Majlis" provided an excellent opportunity for a 
<br>visiting National Defense University delegation to observe 
<br>first-hand the UAEG,s informal consultative process.  MbZ, 
<br>brothers MinState Foreign Affairs Sheikh Hamdan and Interior 
<br>Minister Sheikh Saif, and Labor Minister al Ka'abi were 
<br>joined by several dozen prominent Abu Dhabi officials and 
<br>businessmen for the weekly gathering at Bateen Palace. 
<br> 
<br>NDU 
<br>--- 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (U) NDU President Lt. Gen. Dunn and National War College 
<br>Deputy Commandant Ambassador Wahba briefed MbZ on several new 
<br>NDU initiatives, including opportunities for UAE students in 
<br>the Information Resources Management College program, which 
<br>emphasizes threats, vulnerabilities, and risks in a 
<br>net-centric environment.  Ambassador Sison praised the UAE's 
<br>selection of NDU candidates, noting that several were serving 
<br>in key positions today:  GHQ Armed Forces Deputy Chief of 
<br>Staff MG Mohammed Hilal al-Kaabi, GHQ Director of General 
<br>Procurement Obaid Al Ketbi, Deputy Commander UAE Air Force 
<br>Brigadier Ali, and MbZ's aide Yousef al Otaiba had all 
<br>benefited from NDU programs. 
<br> 
<br>Iraq 
<br>------ 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C) Ambassador Sison noted that day's visit to Iraq by 
<br>Secretary Rice, highlighting the Secretary's encouragement 
<br> 
<br>SIPDIS 
<br>for continued momentum in the political process and her 
<br>meetings with PM al-Jaafari and KDP leader Barzani.  MbZ 
<br>voiced disdain for al-Jaafari, citing (again) his concerns 
<br>over the Prime Minister's ties to Iran.  These concerns were 
<br>aimed at Jaafari's Dawaa Party colleagues, as well.  While 
<br>agreeing that it was important for Iraq's Sunni Arabs to be 
<br>more involved in the political process and in drafting the 
<br>constitution, MbZ complained that "there wasn't one 
<br>worthwhile Sunni" on the scene.  He criticized new Sunni 
<br>Defense Minister Dulaimi as being "in it for himself."  Nor 
<br>did MbZ have anything good to say about former Iraqi Finance 
<br>Minister Mahdi's nomination as one of two Vice Presidents, 
<br>complaining that Mahdi "did not work for the people of Iraq." 
<br> Nonetheless, MbZ said he agreed with the USG's efforts to 
<br>encourage the various Iraqi factions to work together.  The 
<br>UAE would continue to help train Iraqi police forces at the 
<br>UAE's police academy in Al Ain and provide reconstruction 
<br>assistance.  It was important for the region as a whole that 
<br>the U.S. and its allies "got it right" in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, 
<br>and Egypt, he underscored.  (Note:  MbZ aide Yousef al Otaiba 
<br>had a few days earlier shared with Ambassador concerns passed 
<br>by former PM Allawi that Dulaimi was "devious," "bad news," 
<br>"very close" to Iranian intelligence, and had been introduced 
<br>to the Iranians by Chalabi.   Yousef had also noted the 
<br>UAEG,s impression Mahdi had not always been a "team player" 
<br>in the government of former PM Allawi.  End note.) 
<br> 
<br>Iran 
<br>---- 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (S) Turning to Iran, MbZ voiced certainty that the EU-3 
<br>efforts with Iran would break down and that Iran would resume 
<br>its nuclear activities ) if it had not already done so. 
<br>Repeating concerns first voiced to us in February (reftel), 
<br>MbZ appeared convinced that it was only a matter of time 
<br>before Israel or the U.S. would strike Iranian nuclear 
<br>facility targets.  U.S. installations in the Gulf could be 
<br>targeted by Iran in the aftermath of such an action, he 
<br>warned.  MbZ agreed with the USG,s tough line with Tehran 
<br>and the Europeans.  A nuclear-armed Iran would destabilize 
<br>the Gulf region and possibly allow terrorist access to WMD. 
<br>MbZ asked Lt. Gen. Dunn whether it would be possible for 
<br>&anyone8 to "take out" all locations of concern in Iran via 
<br>air power; Lt. Gen. Dunn voiced doubt that this would be 
<br>possible given the dispersed locations.  "Then it will take 
<br>ground forces!" MbZ exclaimed.  Ambassador noted that the 
<br>UAE's Director of Military Intelligence, BG Essa al Mazrouei, 
<br>would pay counterpart visits this week to CENTCOM, J-2, DIA, 
<br>and CIA for discussions on Iran and Iraq-related matters. 
<br>MbZ said he looked forward to sharing "contingency planning" 
<br>scenarios in future conversations. 
<br> 
<br>Pakistan 
<br>-------- 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (C) Ambassador asked about MbZ's visit the week before to 
<br>Lahore to meet with Pakistani President Musharraf.  MbZ 
<br>chuckled and asked why the USG "always" convinced the 
<br>Pakistanis to delay news of the capture of senior Al Qaeda 
<br>operatives such as Abu Faraj al Libbi.  MbZ went on to 
<br>congratulate Washington for its decision to allow U.S. firms 
<br>to bid for contracts to provide F-16s and other defense 
<br>technology to Pakistan.  It was important to support 
<br>Musharraf as he battled the terrorists, he emphasized.  While 
<br>the Indians had and would continue to balk at the decision, 
<br>the region needed Musharraf to stay strong.  There was no 
<br>alternative leader in sight, MbZ opined.  Besides, he 
<br>continued, the F-16 decision would not tip the military 
<br>balance between India and Pakistan.  Even if it had, India's 
<br>strength as a stable democracy would ensure that it would not 
<br>ever be in as "risky" a situation as its neighbor.  MbZ then 
<br>slapped his knee and said "you,ll never guess what Musharraf 
<br>asked me...he asked me whether the UAE had received approval 
<br>for the Predator!"  (Note:  the USG's inability to meet the 
<br>UAE's request for an armed Predator remains a sore point for 
<br>MbZ, although he has not directly raised the issue with us 
<br>for some time.) 
<br> 
<br>Gyrocopter, GAWC 
<br>---------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (SBU) MbZ also referred to his interest in exploring 
<br>selling the UAE's "gyrocopter" (a helicopter-supported UAV 
<br>co-developed with Austrian company Schiebel) to the U.S. Air 
<br>Force, an idea he first floated during Gen. Moseley,s visit 
<br>for the May 3 F-16 ceremony.  MbZ noted that his aide would 
<br>pass detailed gyrocopter specifications to the Embassy this 
<br>week.  (Note: We will be exploring this initiative with 
<br>CENTAF and CENTCOM in relation to force protection aerial 
<br>surveillance system needs at Al Dhafra airbase for the 380 th 
<br>Air Expeditionary Wing.  End note.) 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (C) Lt. Gen. Dunn complimented MbZ on the Gulf Air 
<br>Warfare Center (GAWC), which he and the NDU group had toured 
<br>that morning.  MbZ expressed satisfaction over the 
<br>relationship between the UAE and U.S. Air Forces, but 
<br>expressed disappointment that more GCC countries had not 
<br>joined recent GAWC classes.  Ambassador noted the recent 
<br>robust participation by Saudi Arabia in the GAWC's fourth 
<br>class, which had included six Saudi F-15s and two young 
<br>pilots who were also members of the Saudi royal family.  MbZ 
<br>asked whether the two high-ranking Saudis had actually 
<br>completed all requirements for graduation or had been "passed 
<br>through."  Ambassador confirmed that they had completed all 
<br>course requirements.   MbZ commented that "the real reason" 
<br>the Saudis had turned out for the GAWC class had been "to see 
<br>what the UAE was up to" with the F-16 Block 60 and other 
<br>procurement successes.  Although Egypt and Jordan wished to 
<br>join in the next GAWC class, MbZ added, they also wanted the 
<br>UAE Air Force to pay fuel costs.  MbZ said he had asked both 
<br>countries "to go talk to ADNOC," the state-owned Abu Dhabi 
<br>National Oil Company. 
<br> 
<br>France 
<br>------ 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (U) MbZ noted that he would travel to Paris June 18-20 to 
<br>meet with President Chirac, recalling that he had canceled 
<br>his trip to France at the last minute in mid-January. 
<br> 
<br>Camel Jockeys 
<br>------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (SBU) On the margins of the MbZ conversation, Ambassador 
<br>thanked Interior Minister Sheikh Saif for his assistance the 
<br>week before in allowing G/TIP visitor Feleke Assefa access to 
<br>camel jockey rehabilitation and social support centers. 
<br>Ambassador noted that a Tier 3 ranking remained a possibility 
<br>despite the UAEG,s vigorous efforts since mid-March with 
<br>UNICEF, IOM, and others.  A trafficking in persons 
<br>reassessment would take place in August, she noted, and it 
<br>was important for the UAE to continue the good work it was 
<br>doing in solving the problem.  MbZ aide Yousef al Otaiba 
<br>promised to forward a copy of the UAE-UNICEF TIP implementing 
<br>agreement and budget. (Note: he has done so; we have 
<br>forwarded the document electronically to G/TIP and NEA/ARPI. 
<br>End note.) 
<br> 
<br>Labor and the FTA 
<br>----------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (SBU) Labor Minister al Ka'abi noted he had received 
<br>reports that the U.S. and UAE sides had moved closer on the 
<br>text of the labor chapter of the FTA during the last day of 
<br>negotiations.  He reiterated the UAEG,s concern that it 
<br>receive some recognition of its unique demographic situation, 
<br>as only 15 percent of the population held Emirati 
<br>citizenship.
