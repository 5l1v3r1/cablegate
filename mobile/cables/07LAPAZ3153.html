<br>
<br>Classified By: Ecopol Counselor Mike Hammer for reasons 1.4 b and d. 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary. A common cry among opposition circles is 
<br>that Hugo Chavez is pulling Evo's strings, particularly as 
<br>Morales forcefully pushes forward to adopt a new constitution 
<br>that would provide for indefinite reelection. Evo for his 
<br>part does nothing to hide his admiration for Chavez; on the 
<br>contrary he acts like a smitten school girl when he is with 
<br>Chavez and constantly touts their personal/ideological bond. 
<br>But, how much influence does Chavez have? Is Venezuelan 
<br>money buying loyalty within the Bolivian armed forces? Are 
<br>there sizable numbers of Venezuelan troops in country? Is 
<br>Venezuela smuggling arms into Bolivia? While it is difficult 
<br>to separate fact from fiction, there is little doubt here 
<br>that Evo listens to Chavez, and that the Venezuelan and Cuban 
<br>Ambassadors here play a central advisory role. We have heard 
<br>enough to indicate that Venezuela is impatient with the pace 
<br>of change in Bolivia and is pushing Morales hard to 
<br>consolidate his hold on power. The results of Venezuelan 
<br>December 2 constitutional referendum may impact Evo's 
<br>thinking on how he should proceed with a similar referendum 
<br>in Bolivia. End summary

<br>
<br>¶2. (C) While the opposition sometimes exaggerates Chavez' 
<br>influence over Morales, Brazilian and Peruvian diplomats 
<br>based in La Paz assert that it is becoming increasingly 
<br>evident that Chavez is pushing Evo to follow Venezuela's 
<br>script. These diplomats recounted a GRULAC dinner hosted by 
<br>the Cuban Ambassador on November 26, attended by President 
<br>Morales (who arrived with the Venezuelan Ambassador), during 
<br>which Evo told the group that "there is no going back." 
<br>Morales expressed displeasure with how his MAS party handled 
<br>the Constituent Assembly process in Sucre but was vehement 
<br>that a new constitution must go forward. To the astonishment 
<br>of the Latin American diplomats present, the Venezuelan 
<br>Ambassador then launched into a 30-minute ramble about the 
<br>common history Bolivia and Venezuela share and how their 
<br>futures are linked. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) According to the Brazilian political counselor, an 
<br>"extremely reliable" source had reported that the Venezuelan 
<br>Ambassador was at an Evo cabinet meeting November 29 as the 
<br>MAS-led Constituent Assembly was proceeding in Sucre. 
<br>Apparently, when a couple of ministers expressed concern 
<br>about moving forward unilaterally with the Constituent 
<br>Assembly, the Venezuelan Ambassador urged that the government 
<br>go ahead. Comment: While we are quite skeptical that the 
<br>Venezuelan Ambassador would actually attend a cabinet 
<br>meeting, ROAL sources independently place the Venezuelan at 
<br>the Palace that day. Whether or not the Venezuelan 
<br>Ambassador actually attended the cabinet meeting, Evo meets 
<br>regularly with him and undoubtedly seeks his advice. End 
<br>Comment.) 
<br>
<br>Venezuelan Military Presence in Beni Department

<br>
<br>¶4. (C) In a discussion with Peruvian, German, Argentine and 
<br>Brazilian diplomats here, all expressed concern about a known 
<br>Venezuelan military presence in the northeastern Beni 
<br>department (bordering Brazil). It is quite public and in 
<br>fact touted that a Venezuelan engineer company is building 
<br>levies around the Beni capital of Trinidad. Beni local 
<br>authorities are, however, convinced that the Venezuelans are 
<br>also training Bolivian military in special operations and 
<br>have sizable arms caches for a possible further deployment. 
<br>The German reported that without a doubt there is a 
<br>Venezuelan base in San Borja, but the other diplomats were 
<br>dismissive of this information and argued that the Beni 
<br>authorities tend to greatly exaggerate. We cannot confirm 
<br>that there is a "secret" Venezuelan base at that location and 
<br>suspect that the opposition is exaggerating and/or is simply 
<br>expressing concern about the Venezuelan military presence. 
<br>Our Defense Attach was told by the Mayor of Trinidad on 
<br>November 26 that there are 200 to 300 Venezuelans in 
<br>Trinidad. The group of diplomats affirmed that the number of 
<br>Venezuelans is about 300, but no one is completely certain. 
<br>We understand that the Venezuelans have exclusive control 
<br>over Venezuelan flights and cargo, and exercise an inordinate 
<br>amount of control over the military portion of the Trinidad 
<br>airport.

<br>
<br>¶5. (S) Defense Attach also met with Trinidad Mayor Moises 
<br>Shiriqui following a meeting between Beni Department Prefect 
<br>Ernesto Suarez and Beni Mayors. The Mayor brought up the 
<br>0100 arrival of a Venezuela C-130 cargo plane at the Beni 
<br>airport November 24, which local authorities suspected was 
<br>shuttling arms. After unloading seven large wooden crates, 
<br>the plane immediately departed. Authorities told the media, 
<br>which were forced to leave shortly after the landing, that 
<br>the boxes contained medical supplies. (Note: We have not 
<br>been able to determine what is in the crates. End note.) 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Prefect Suarez announced publicly November 29 that 
<br>Venezuelan planes would not be allowed to land at Trinidad. 
<br>If provided advance landing notice from the government, local 
<br>authorities plan to block the runway with vehicles in order 
<br>to prevent any Venezuelan plane from landing or taking off. 
<br>(Note: Official Airport hours are between 0800 and 2200. 
<br>There is a history of opposition accusations the Venezuelans 
<br>are shipping in arms, perhaps destined for nefarious 
<br>pro-government groups. The opposition also complained about 
<br>an early morning Beni stopover by Venezuelan President Hugo 
<br>Chavez as an affront to Bolivian sovereignty. Ref A. End 
<br>Note.) 
<br>
<br>Will Evo Turn To Comandante Chavez? 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) The Peruvian political counselor was extremely 
<br>concerned that Venezuela, at Evo's invitation, would 
<br>intervene militarily in Bolivia to back Morales should he be 
<br>unable to exercise control over the opposition departments of 
<br>Beni, Pando, Tarija and Santa Cruz. The Peruvian believes, 
<br>and the Brazilian agreed, that the rank-and-file military 
<br>will not/not use lethal force against fellow Bolivians. We 
<br>too share this assessment (Ref B). The Peruvian and 
<br>Brazilian both commented that funds coming in from Venezuela 
<br>to the Bolivian military do not flow down from the senior 
<br>ranks, and therefore, there is much resentment. The top 
<br>military commanders, however, are opportunists that will 
<br>follow Evo's orders out of self-interest. In fact, Generals 
<br>Vargas, Bersatti and Trigo are reportedly fighting to stay in 
<br>their jobs, causing further disgruntlement among those who 
<br>would like to move into their positions. So, there are 
<br>strong indications that the military is split and could be 
<br>quite reticent to follow orders. Hence, with no Bolivian 
<br>military to enforce Evo's will, Peru fears he will turn to 
<br>Chavez.

<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU) Chavez's November 27 statement that the U.S. 
<br>"empire" is "promoting violence" in order to overthrow the 
<br>Morales administration builds on a constant barrage of 
<br>inflammatory statements indicating a willingness, or perhaps 
<br>an eagerness, to send Venezuelan troops to Bolivia to bolster 
<br>his erstwhile ally. Chavez's October 14 threat to turn 
<br>Bolivia into Vietnam should "oligarchs" attack Morales 
<br>provided the opposition with traction for long-standing 
<br>complaints of Venezuelan "imperialist" designs. Morales 
<br>defended the remarks in November 4 magazine article. Both 
<br>leaders reiterated and expanded upon the Vietnam remarks 
<br>during their November 10 addresses at the Ibero-American 
<br>Conference in Chile, where Chavez warned Bolivian supporters 
<br>of the United States ("pitiyanquies") that any attempt to 
<br>remove Morales would be met with "a thunder of rifles and 
<br>machine guns." Questions over possible Venezuelan 
<br>involvement in the October 18 Bolivian military takeover of 
<br>Santa Cruz's Viru Viru Airport further ignited criticism of 
<br>the Bolivian-Venezuelan relationship. Venezuelan 
<br>"imperialism" has stayed in the headlines since, fed by 
<br>heated exchanges between opposition and government officials, 
<br>an alleged attack on the Venezuelan consulate in Santa Cruz, 
<br>and a scandal involving $11 million in missing Venezuelan 
<br>micro-credit loans.

<br>
<br>¶9. (C) The opposition's cries of Chavez the big bad wolf are 
<br>over the top, but they are right when they express concern 
<br>that Evo is getting advice from the Venezuelans and Cubans. 
<br>With checks and doctors, the Venezuelan and Cuban ambassadors 
<br>are doing what they can to bolster Evo and push his change 
<br>program. For example, it is estimated that Evo has 
<br>distributed around $60-80 million in Venezuelan checks to 
<br>municipalities since he came to office. That said, beyond the 
<br>financial support and advisory role, we find little hard 
<br>evidence to support the prospect of actual Venezuelan 
<br>military intervention in Bolivia. The opposition will 
<br>continue to point to Chavez to discredit Evo and are hoping 
<br>that a victory for the "no" vote in Venezuela's referendum 
<br>will give Evo pause about proceeding with his. Likewise, the 
<br>opposition fears that if Chavez wins, he will embolden Evo to 
<br>push ahead
