<br>SIPDIS 
<br>
<br>------- 
<br>Summary 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>(C) 1. The Embassy obtained a copy of with the results of the 
<br>Government of Iraq's (GOI) investigation report of the 
<br>September 16 incident at Nisoor Square. The report portrays 
<br>the incident as an unprovoked attack on unarmed civilians, 
<br>references a number of other alleged incidents involving 
<br>Blackwater, recommends payments of $8 million and $4 million 
<br>for each death and injury respectively, and calls for the USG 
<br>to replace Blackwater within six months of the incident. It 
<br>is unclear to what extent the GOI is committed to these 
<br>recommendations or how it intends to implement them. The 
<br>Embassy has begun accepting claims from victims of the 
<br>incident, with 15 claims submitted so far. Post has approved 
<br>payments of $10,000 for each death, $5,000 for each injury, 
<br>and $2,500 for property damage. The Regional Security Office 
<br>(RSO) is implementing changes to procedures and increasing 
<br>linkages to the GOI for cooperation and information sharing 
<br>on PSD issues. The Embassy is awaiting the Department's 
<br>determination as to what information about past PSD incidents 
<br>can be shared with the Joint Commission, and is developing a 
<br>work plan to guide the meetings of the Joint Commission; this 
<br>work plan will also form the basis of Post's proposed 
<br>structure for the Joint Commission's report. 
<br>
<br>----------------- 
<br>GOI Investigation 
<br>----------------- 
<br>
<br>(C) 2. On October 11 the Ministry of Defense (MOD) gave the 
<br>Embassy a copy of the final report of its investigative 
<br>committee. The report was produced and endorsed by the eight 
<br>Iraqi members of the Joint Commission. The details of the 
<br>incident as described in the report portray a random and 
<br>unprovoked shooting involving small and medium arms fire 
<br>resulting in the deaths of vehicle passengers and bystanders. 
<br>The report states that there was no evidence the convoy was 
<br>fired upon, that a total of 17 Iraqis were killed, 27 
<br>wounded, 7 cars burned or damaged, and that 2 Iraqi Security 
<br>Forces were among the casualties. 
<br>
<br>(C) 3. The report concludes that the conduct of the PSD 
<br>violated Iraqi law and a number of CPA orders and that 
<br>therefore the incident is a pre-meditated murder for which 
<br>the Blackwater personnel must be held accountable. It also 
<br>claims that the Ministry of Interior has information on seven 
<br>other instances in which Blackwater personnel killed 10 
<br>Iraqis and wounded 15 others. It states that due to these 
<br>previous violations, the company's license was not renewed 
<br>after it expired in June 2006. 
<br>
<br>The report makes 5 recommendations: 
<br>
<br>-- 1: That a court investigate the crime and take actions as 
<br>stipulated by relevant CPA and Iraqi law immediately. 
<br>-- 2: That the Council of Ministers requests the U.S. 
<br>Government replace Blackwater within six months of the 
<br>incident and replace it with a more disciplined company. 
<br>-- 3: That Blackwater pay $8 million for each death and $4 
<br>million for each injury. 
<br>-- 4: That the MOI address the issue of Blackwater operating 
<br>illegally (without a license). 
<br>-- 5: That new legislation governing security contractors 
<br>drafted by the MOI and currently being considered by 
<br>legislative bodies be adopted as quickly as possible (Ref A). 
<br>
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br>Embassy Approves Condolence Payments 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>(C) 4. On October 18 and October 20 the Embassy sent a team 
<br>to the National Iraqi Assistance Center, a facility where 
<br>MNF-I collects claims paperwork from Iraqis injured in MNF-I 
<br>incidents, to collect applications from the Nisoor Square 
<br>incident. The Iraqi National Police previously provided the 
<br>Embassy with contact information of family members for 7 of 
<br>the 17 Iraqis killed and for 15 of the 27 injured, all of 
<br>whom were contacted. So far the Embassy has received 
<br>
<br>paperwork for 15 claims, including one claim form that was 
<br>previously submitted to MNF-I. 
<br>
<br>(C) 5. On October 21 the Embassy Claims and Condolence 
<br>Committee, chaired by the DCM, reviewed the claims submitted. 
<br>The Embassy's claims and condolence program is modeled after 
<br>MNC-I's, which typically provides up to $2,500 per incident 
<br>(death, injury or property damage) but which permits payments 
<br>of up to $10,000 per incident in extraordinary 
<br>circumstances, if approved by the MNC-I Division Commanding 
<br>General. Consistent with military practice and with the 
<br>Ambassador's approval, the Committee agreed to make payments 
<br>of $10,000 to the family members of those killed, $5,000 to 
<br>those injured, and $2,500 for each instance of property 
<br>damage. The Committee agreed to arrange a forum for payment 
<br>to the 15 claimants who have already filed paperwork, to 
<br>expedite this payment, and to work with the GOI to contact 
<br>the remaining potential claimants. The Embassy believes that 
<br>Blackwater should also make its own payments in this 
<br>incident, and requests the Department's assistance in 
<br>conveying this message. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- -- 
<br>Preparing for the next Joint Commission Meeting 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -- 
<br>
<br>(C) 6. As agreed at the first Joint Commission Meeting on 
<br>October 7 (Ref A), the Embassy is working with the Department 
<br>to decide what information regarding the Nisoor Square and 
<br>other PSD incidents can be shared with the Commission. The 
<br>Embassy Legal Advisor is developing a work plan for the 
<br>Commission, which, after consultation with our Iraq working 
<br>level counterparts, we plan to introduce at the next meeting. 
<br>The goal of this plan is to have each of the Joint 
<br>Commission's meetings focus on one of the major themes of the 
<br>report that the Commission will ultimately issue. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br>Investigation and Regional Security Office Update 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br>
<br>(C) 7. The FBI continues its investigation with support from 
<br>the Regional Security Officer (RSO) as needed. The RSO is 
<br>implementing changes to its operating procedures. Diplomatic 
<br>Security (DS) agents are now in charge of and accompanying 
<br>all Chief of Mission (COM) motorcade movements in Baghdad 
<br>outside of the IZ and to the extent possible in the rest of 
<br>Iraq. An increased staffing pattern to sustain this larger 
<br>workload has been approved by Post Management and has been 
<br>submitted to the Department. DS is in the process of 
<br>procuring video systems for all PSD vehicles and 
<br>communications recording equipment for the Tactical 
<br>Operations Center. The RSO is also taking technological steps 
<br>to improve the mutual awareness of RSO and MNC-I elements in 
<br>the field, and is procuring radios that will allow tactical 
<br>communications between RSO air and ground assets and MNC-I 
<br>assets. 
<br>
<br>(C) 8. The RSO is also forming an investigative response unit 
<br>that will potentially include MNF-I and GOI representatives, 
<br>to investigate all incidents involving COM security assets, 
<br>including statistical analysis and metrics of PSD incidents 
<br>and systematic collection and archiving of recorded video 
<br>footage and radio communications. Additionally, the RSO is 
<br>reviewing the viability of alternative non-lethal escalation 
<br>of force procedures. 
<br>
<br>(C) 9. The RSO is working to improve linkages to the GOI for 
<br>the general sharing of information and investigation of 
<br>specific PSD incidents. The RSO will be participating 
<br>regularly in the GOI/USG Crisis Action Cell, which is a 
<br>weekly meeting between senior U.S. military officials, the 
<br>Minister of Defense, and the National Security Advisor where 
<br>PSD incidents are often raised. The RSO is scheduled to meet 
<br>with the Chiefs of the Iraqi Police and the National Police 
<br>in an effort to develop closer working-level relationships. 
<br>
<br>-------------- 
<br>Media Coverage 
<br>-------------- 
<br>
<br>(C) 10. The Nisoor Square incident and private security 
<br>contractors in general have continued to receive negative 
<br>coverage and have served as rallying points for Iraqi 
<br>politicians and government officials (both those in power and 
<br>in the opposition). Coverage of the establishment of the 
<br>Joint Commission stemmed mostly from U.S. Government 
<br>statements about it. Coverage of GOI statements included 
<br>those of Al-Dabbagh on October 7 saying that the Iraqi 
<br>investigation found Blackwater responsible for "deliberate 
<br>murder". Other reports focused on the GOI's call for 
<br>Blackwater to pay a total of $136 million for the incident 
<br>and comparing it to the Lockerbie bombing. An October 9 
<br>
<br>incident involving Unity Resources Group (URG), the PSD of a 
<br>USAID contractor, in which two Iraqi women were killed, was 
<br>reported as a "Blackwater-type massacre". 
<br>
<br>(C) 11. Newspaper and other coverage waned due to the Eid 
<br>al-Fitr holiday, but Blackwater returned to the press once 
<br>the news cycle resumed, with reports focusing on the Prime 
<br>Minister's advisor Sami al-Askri who said "the Iraqi 
<br>government has a clear position regarding the future of 
<br>Blackwater in Iraq. The security firm should be expelled 
<br>within six months." Editorials in all of Iraq's newspapers 
<br>have lashed out at Blackwater, likening it to another militia 
<br>contributing to the deterioration of Iraq's security. 
<br>Numerous editorial cartoons have been published depicting 
<br>Blackwater as bloodthirsty mercenaries. While the escalation 
<br>of the Turkish border issue has been dominating the media, 
<br>the Blackwater incident will likely remain a prominent issue 
<br>for editorials and political cartoons as the unpopularity of 
<br>private security firms makes it an easy target.
