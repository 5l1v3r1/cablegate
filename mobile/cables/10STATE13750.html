<br>SUBJECT: READOUT OF JANUARY 20 U.S.-FRANCE STRATEGIC DIALOGUE 
<br>IN WASHINGTON 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Under Secretary Bill Burns for reasons 1.4(b, 
<br>d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (S/NF) Summary.  On January 20, 2010, Under Secretary Bill 
<br>Burns and Defense Under Secretary for Policy Michele Flournoy 
<br>hosted the third U.S.-France Strategic Dialogue with 
<br>counterparts Jacques Audibert and Michel Miraillet. 
<br>Discussions focused on Afghanistan, Pakistan, NATO Reform, 
<br>Missile Defense, Turkey, Russia, Iran, and the Middle East 
<br>Peace Process.  The French indicated an announcement of 
<br>further civilian contributions to Afghanistan would be made at 
<br>the London Conference, but hedged on a decision regarding 
<br>additional combat troops.  On NATO's new Strategic Concept, 
<br>the French highlighted the potential for a split in the 
<br>Alliance between old and new members, and agreed that a 
<br>document that linked to NATO reform measures was needed.  The 
<br>French requested more information on the U.S. proposal to make 
<br>Missile Defense a mission for NATO.  Both U/S Burns and USD(P) 
<br>Flournoy underscored that the potential sale of a French 
<br>Mistral-class Helicopter carrier to Russia would be unhelpful 
<br>in terms of regional stability.  Next steps on Iran were 
<br>discussed with the French agreeing that the European Union 
<br>(EU) was more unified than ever on the need for increased 
<br>pressure and welcoming U.S. efforts to engage the EU as a 
<br>whole on this issue.  End Summary. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>------------------------ 
<br>AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTAN 
<br>------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (S/NF)  U/S Burns praised the French contributions and 
<br>previewed U.S. goals for the London Conference on Afghanistan, 
<br>which included agreement on growing the Afghan National 
<br>Security Forces (ANSF), reintegration, and choosing a new UN 
<br>Senior Representative for Afghanistan.  USD(P) reviewed the 
<br>POTUS decision and highlighted that July 11, 2011 was an 
<br>inflection point -- the beginning of a process.  She noted 
<br>that POTUS was careful to not create an artificial timeline 
<br>for transition to Afghan responsibility and that the U.S. 
<br>message to the region is that "we are not leaving."  Deputy 
<br>SRAP Jones described the new U.S. regional stability strategy 
<br>and our efforts to align Karzai with the international 
<br>community's civilian priorities. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (S/NF)  Audibert remarked on France's "special" commitment 
<br>to Afghanistan based on France leading the invocation of 
<br>NATO's Article 5 after 9/11.  Nine years later, the French 
<br>cite Allied unity as the mission's principal success.  France 
<br>believes the President's announcement of 30,000 more troops 
<br>substantively changed the operation.  While the London 
<br>conference is a chance to impress upon Afghan President Hamid 
<br>Karzai that he must implement the commitments in his 
<br>inauguration speech, the French are concerned it might be too 
<br>early to put too much political pressure on Karzai.  Audibert 
<br>suggested a second international conference on Afghanistan in 
<br>the spring would be helpful and was pleased to hear about 
<br>plans for an April conference in Kabul.  Audibert also stated 
<br>that France will make an announcement about its "civilian 
<br>surge" at the London conference, but that commitments on 
<br>further troop deployments were not ready.  Miraillet lamented 
<br>French public opposition to the war in Afghanistan, but 
<br>believed that the government was making progress in convincing 
<br>the French people of the necessity for the operation.  He also 
<br>explained that the military staff had developed several plans 
<br>for additional contributions, which were now with President 
<br>Sarkozy for action. 
<br> 
<br>---------------------- 
<br>NATO STRATEGIC CONCEPT 
<br>---------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (C/NF) Audibert noted that the Strategic Concept (SC) was 
<br>"not a redrafting of the Washington Treaty," and should not 
<br>open troublesome issues such as new missions and redefining 
<br>Article 5.  He further emphasized that France wanted to stay 
<br>as close to the 1999 Strategic Concept as possible on language 
<br> 
<br>STATE 00013750  002 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>relating to NATO nuclear issues.  Audibert highlighted the 
<br>risk of a split between old and newer members of the Alliance 
<br>on these questions and advocated for a short, simple document. 
<br>The French want to use the Strategic Concept to drive reform 
<br>at NATO.  He noted that France had submitted several proposals 
<br>on reform and that France was keen for U.S. support. 
<br>Miraillet added that with the dire state of NATO financing, it 
<br>was important to stress financial reform even before the 
<br>drafting of the Strategic Concept.  Miraillet also warned that 
<br>SecGen Rasmussen might put a tight grip on drafting the 
<br>concept and cautioned that Turkey would play a stronger role 
<br>in drafting than in 1999. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (C/NF)  USD(P) asserted that the U.S. has played a leading 
<br>role in the Senior Officials Group (SOG) because of our strong 
<br>commitment to NATO reform.  On the SC, she said it was 
<br>important that the key Allies make their input to the SecGen 
<br>before pen was put to paper.  Further, USD(P) clarified that 
<br>the U.S. did not believe Alliance transformation could happen 
<br>without financial reform and that it was a priority for the 
<br>U.S. State Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian 
<br>Affairs Phil Gordon agreed; any misperception that the U.S. 
<br>did not want to link the Strategic Concept to reform must be 
<br>corrected.  OSD Assistant Secretary for International Security 
<br>Affairs Alexander Vershbow added that the new concept must put 
<br>a public face on the Alliance and address issues for the 
<br>future, such as Article 4 and crisis management capacity.  He 
<br>agreed that reform of financing was critical as the current 
<br>budget crisis evidenced.  ASD Vershbow stressed that we must 
<br>work with the UK to solve the financial crisis at NATO and 
<br>suggested that the idea of "zero real growth" be put aside. 
<br>Audibert was pleased to hear that the U.S. was on the same 
<br>page as France regarding reform and that this was a priority 
<br>goal for the French side during the Strategic Dialogue. 
<br> 
<br>--------------- 
<br>Missile Defense 
<br>--------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (S/NF)  USD(P) briefed the French on the current state of 
<br>play regarding worldwide U.S. missile defense plans.  She 
<br>noted that the Ballistic Missile Defense Review (BMDR) would 
<br>soon be submitted to Congress and noted the Phased Adaptive 
<br>Approach (PAA) would be a U.S. contribution to a NATO Missile 
<br>Defense project.  This plan would protect both U.S. forces and 
<br>interests in Europe and our NATO Allies.  USD(P) requested 
<br>French support for securing NATO approval for the Active 
<br>Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (ALTBMD) program to 
<br>become the Command and Control (C2) backbone of a wider 
<br>European Missile Defense program.  USD(P) stressed that NATO 
<br>approval for the C2 relationship between ALTBMD and the PAA 
<br>was important as Turkey was unlikely to approve participation 
<br>unless it was part of a larger NATO enterprise. 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (S/NF)  Miraillet conveyed that France was pleased with 
<br>the Obama administration's swift action on Missile Defense and 
<br>welcomed the U.S. development of the PAA.  France shared the 
<br>U.S. perception of the threat and had ideas on ways it could 
<br>participate in the U.S.-proposed system. However, Miraillet 
<br>emphasized that France needed more information before the 
<br>government could endorse a NATO-PAA linkage through ALTBMD, 
<br>and argued that the Lisbon Summit may be too early for a NATO 
<br>decision.  He said that France wanted information on phases 
<br>three and four of the PAA and whether the SM-3 Block 2B could 
<br>be perceived as a threat by the Russians.  Audibert added that 
<br>France needed much more detail on the potential costs to NATO 
<br>Allies before endorsing ALTBMD as the C2 for the European 
<br>Missile Defense system.  He also asked how the C2 
<br>relationships in the system would work in a NATO context. 
<br>Audibert concluded by underscoring that French hesitation on 
<br>accepting a NATO role for European-wide Missile Defense is not 
<br>reluctance, but a reflection of the need for greater clarity 
<br>on what was being proposed. 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (S/NF)  In response, USD(P) Flournoy said we would soon 
<br>share additional details on C2 arrangements, noting that 
<br>authorities would need to be delegated given the short 
<br>decision time for a response.  She and ASD Vershbow pressed 
<br>the importance of a political decision at Lisbon to adopt 
<br>territorial Missile Defense as a NATO mission, both to secure 
<br>Turkish agreement to host the forward-based radar and to 
<br>demonstrate that NATO was addressing real Article 5 threats. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>STATE 00013750  003 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>------ 
<br>Turkey 
<br>------ 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (S/NF)  Miraillet and Audibert were remarkably downbeat on 
<br>Turkey and lamented poor French bilateral relations with 
<br>Turkish leadership, though they believed ties were slowly 
<br>improving.  Miraillet believed the military leaders were no 
<br>longer what they once were as the recent Ergenekon scandal had 
<br>weakened the influence of the Generals in Turkish politics. 
<br>Miraillet asserted that FM Ahmet Davutoglu had kept with his 
<br>theory of "strategic depth," which he had described in his 
<br>previously published books, through Turkey's continued 
<br>engagement with neighbors like Syria and Iran and in Turkey's 
<br>proactive approach to the Caucasus and recognition of the 
<br>Iraqi Kurds.  Miraillet, in noting that the Turkish military 
<br>had of late established a better relationship with the 
<br>Pakistani military, stated that Turkey was a nuclear threshold 
<br>country and that France did not know if there were similar 
<br>civilian nuclear cooperation linkages with Pakistan.  In 
<br>highlighting Turkey's unwillingness to engage in combat in 
<br>Afghanistan, its improved relationships with Syria and Hamas, 
<br>its willingness to negotiate with Iran outside the P5-plus-1 
<br>process, and its position on selecting a new NATO Secretary 
<br>General at the April 2009 Strasbourg Summit, Miraillet summed 
<br>up that Turkey was becoming more of a global actor, but not 
<br>always a positive actor in the international system. 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (S/NF)  USD(P) asked whether the EU was closer to 
<br>identifying a way that it could signal to Turkey that the door 
<br>was open to a closer relationship, such as observer status in 
<br>the European Defense Agency.  Audibert noted that President 
<br>Sarkozy had been particularly upset with the Turkish position 
<br>on Rasmussen at Strasbourg and that Sarkozy's objection to 
<br>Turkish membership in the EU was one of five pillars on his 
<br>political campaign that the public still remembered.  Further, 
<br>when France tried to move forward with closer NATO-EU ties 
<br>during its 2008 EU presidency, Turkey rejected every plan that 
<br>was put on the table.  For these reasons, it would be 
<br>difficult for France to see any opening on EU membership for 
<br>Turkey in the near future.  All French interlocutors agreed 
<br>that a "more arrogant" Turkey could present a problem during 
<br>NATO Strategic Concept discussions this year.  In response, 
<br>Flournoy, Vershbow and Gordon reiterated that by closing the 
<br>door on the Turks, the EU was creating a vicious circle that 
<br>fueled Turkish obstructionism at NATO. 
<br> 
<br>------ 
<br>Russia 
<br>------ 
<br> 
<br>¶11.  (S/NF)  Audibert began by stating that France was taking 
<br>pragmatic approach to Russia, but that President Sarkozy had a 
<br>"problem of confidence" and did not fully trust Russia. 
<br>Audibert said Russia's two treaty proposals on new European 
<br>Security Architecture were unacceptable and mere provocations, 
<br>but that the French position was to use the proposals to 
<br>engage the Russians on new approaches to crisis management, 
<br>the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty, and on the 
<br>adoption of the Open Skies/verification measures. However, he 
<br>noted, these issues will continually be bogged down over the 
<br>situation in Georgia, which Audibert saw as intractable as 
<br>Russia will never "derecognize" the sovereignty of Abkhazia 
<br>and South Ossetia while also never recognizing Georgian 
<br>sovereignty over its territory, including the two enclaves. 
<br> 
<br>¶12.  (S/NF) Audibert, noting he was raising his "if-raised" 
<br>point, brought up the issue of France's potential sale of a 
<br>helicopter carrier Mistral-class ship to Russia.  He asserted 
<br>that the French had merely agreed to negotiate with Russia on 
<br>the potential sale, but then argued that sale would be only 
<br>for the ship without armament systems.  Audibert also said 
<br>that while France understood U.S. concerns over the potential 
<br>for Russia to use the ship for projection of power, it was 
<br>important to note that any decision on the issue would, in the 
<br>end, be political in nature.  Miraillet stated that this sale 
<br>would be a gesture of good will to Russia as France assessed 
<br>the Russian Navy was in dire condition.  In any case, 
<br>concluded Miraillet, if France did not make the sale, the 
<br>Netherlands and Spain would likely sell similar technology. 
<br> 
<br>¶13.  (S/NF)  On Mistral, USD(P) observed the optics and policy 
<br>behind the sale were perplexing as it would "fly in the face" 
<br> 
<br>STATE 00013750  004 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>of President Sarkozy's personal engagement on resolving the 
<br>Georgia crisis in 2008.  She asserted that this sale would 
<br>send a confusing political signal to Russia as well as to 
<br>other Europeans.  U/S Burns concurred with USD(P), noting the 
<br>sale would feed Georgia's fears and could lead to an arms 
<br>race, increasing the chance of miscalculation by one or both 
<br>sides.  USD(P) concluded that while we understood that France 
<br>wanted to actively engage Russia, the U.S. would prefer that 
<br>France find a different confidence-building measure than a 
<br>Mistral sale. 
<br> 
<br>---- 
<br>Iran 
<br>---- 
<br> 
<br>¶14.  (S/NF)  U/S Burns stated that the international community 
<br>had reached a point where it had to begin looking for further 
<br>consequences for Iran as the credibility of our efforts was at 
<br>stake.  U/S Burns noted that other actors were watching 
<br>Western actions on Iran.  He cautioned that moving China 
<br>toward greater sanctions would not be easy, but that we need 
<br>to continue engaging them. 
<br> 
<br>¶15.  (S/NF)  Audibert noted that France was using every means 
<br>possible to bring the EU together on Iran.  He noted a 
<br>recently EU Council decision to task Foreign Ministers with 
<br>developing new ideas on the way forward with Iran.  Briens 
<br>stated that since the Iranian regime cracked down following 
<br>the June 2009 elections,  the EU was more solid as a block on 
<br>sanctions.  In particular,  Spain and Sweden, who were 
<br>reluctant to support sanctions in the past, were more 
<br>supportive because of recent gross human rights violations. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------- 
<br>Middle East Peace Process 
<br>------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶16.  (S/NF)  Audibert hailed U.S. efforts to reestablish peace 
<br>talks between Israel and the Palestinians.  He asked pointedly 
<br>where the U.S. saw the process in the next six months, and how 
<br>to further involve Europe, especially regarding a possible 
<br>settlement.  Notably, the French did not advocate for a Middle 
<br>East summit in Paris.
