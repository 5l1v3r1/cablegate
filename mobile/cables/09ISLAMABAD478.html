<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) Summary: Rival Pakistani Taliban leaders Baitullah 
<br>Mehsud, Maulvi Nazir, and Hafiz Gul Bahadur formed a new 
<br>militant alliance on February 23. The new alliance 
<br>recognizes Taliban leader Mullah Omar as its leader, and its 
<br>goal is to fight the planned U.S. troop surge in Afghanistan. 
<br>The Pakistani militant leaders will maintain their 
<br>independent militants groups but will now facilitate 
<br>cooperation in cross-border attacks in Afghanistan. It is 
<br>too early to say how effective this new alliance will be in 
<br>launching cross-border attacks against U.S./NATO forces in 
<br>Afghanistan, but it does give the largest and most powerful 
<br>Pakistani Taliban leaders unfettered access across North and 
<br>South Waziristan. Formation of the alliance demonstrates 
<br>that the GOP's tribal "divide and conquer" strategy is not 
<br>working, at least not to our advantage. Civilian leaders are 
<br>concerned about the continuing loss of government writ in the 
<br>Waziristans after this agreement, but Pakistan's security 
<br>forces may see few downsides to an alliance that focuses its 
<br>attacks outside of Pakistan. End summary. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) On February 23, Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP) leader 
<br>Baitullah Mehsud signed a deal with two powerful rival 
<br>Taliban commanders Maulvi Nazir of South Waziristan and Hafiz 
<br>Gul Bahadur of North Waziristan. The three, according to 
<br>press reports, have formed a new group called Shura 
<br>Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen (Mujahideen Unity Council), that they 
<br>claim will unite them against external forces trying to 
<br>divide the multiple Taliban groups based in Pakistan. They 
<br>have formed a 13-member shura to run the affairs of the new 
<br>alliance. The militants named Mullah Omar as their supreme 
<br>leader, but the group did not choose a leader of its 
<br>operational shura. According to a joint public statement, 
<br>the militant leaders praised Osama Bin Laden and Mullah Omar 
<br>as defenders of Islam and Muslims. The spokesman for 
<br>Baitullah Mehsud, Mufti Waliullah, said that the three 
<br>Taliban commanders would now operate from a single platform 
<br>under the new alliance. Currently Baitullah Mehsud controls 
<br>the eastern portion of South Waziristan, which is populated 
<br>largely by Mehsud tribesmen. Maulvi Nazir is based out of 
<br>the Ahmedzai Wazir area of South Waziristan on the agency's 
<br>western border with Afghanistan. Hafiz Gul Bahadur leads his 
<br>Utmanzai Wazir militants from Miram Shah, North Waziristan. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) The formation of the new alliance follows Baitullah 
<br>Mehsud's December 2007 formation of TTP as an umbrella group 
<br>to better coordinate pro-Taliban activities. The creation of 
<br>the TTP was the merger of various Pakistani militant groups 
<br>operating under disparate commands in different tribal 
<br>agencies. The TTP alliance runs as a loose federation rather 
<br>than a strictly controlled organization. Each of the 
<br>militant leaders maintains a degree of autonomy and Baitullah 
<br>Mehsud, as the strongest leader of Pakistani Taliban, lends 
<br>his support and coordination to the various TTP subcommanders 
<br>in places such as Bajaur and Swat. Nazir, who broke openly 
<br>with Mehsud in the spring of 2007 (see para 6), was not a 
<br>part of TTP. Bahadur, who had jockeyed with Mehsud for the 
<br>title of pre-eminent local militant leader in the 
<br>Waziristans, had maintained some distance from the TTP label 
<br>before now. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) The new Mujahideen Unity Council will likely be 
<br>another loose federation with each Taliban commander 
<br>maintaining his own authority. Federally Administered Tribal 
<br>Areas (FATA) Secretariat Additional Chief Secretary 
<br>Habibullah Khan expressed concern to Peshawar Principal 
<br>Officer in a February 24 meeting that this new body provides 
<br>all three militant leaders with unfettered access to all of 
<br>South and North Waziristan. Baitullah Mehsud will be a main 
<br>beneficiary of this new access, giving his fighters easier 
<br>entry to the Afghanistan border through Maulvi Nazir's 
<br>Wazir-held territory. Before the deal, Mehsud had limited 
<br>access to the border from his portion of South Waziristan 
<br>because he was blocked either by Maulvi Nazir or Gul Bahadur. 
<br>While the alliance will not work as a tight top-down 
<br>militant organization, it will facilitate access and 
<br>coordination of various Pakistani Taliban as they cross into 
<br>Afghanistan. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) While Khan had no hard facts, he detected the hand of 
<br>the Haqqani network in bringing these rival commanders 
<br>together. The new coordination, he feared, will allow the 
<br>Taliban to focus on sending militants across the border into 
<br>Afghanistan. Sirajuddin Haqqani also claimed in the press 
<br>that he had convinced the three rival Taliban leaders to 
<br>meet. Sirajuddin and his father Jalaluddin Haqqani lead much 
<br>of the Taliban militancy in eastern Afghanistan. Sirajuddin 
<br>often travels to the tribal areas of Pakistan, North 
<br>Waziristan in particular, and has served as a mediator 
<br>between these rival Taliban leaders. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) In the past, the Pakistani government has supported 
<br>Maulvi Nazir in an attempt to counter Baitullah Mehsud in 
<br>South Waziristan. In the spring of 2007, an open break 
<br>between Nazir and Mehsud took place over the presence of 
<br>"Uzbek" fighters in South Waziristan. The disagreement 
<br>culminated in an operation in which Pakistani security forces 
<br>fought alongside Nazir's followers to oust Uzbeks from the 
<br>area. While Nazir appeared to draw on genuine local anger 
<br>and desire to remove "Uzbeks," his activities as an al-Qaida 
<br>facilitator and promoter of cross-border attacks have always 
<br>complicated Pakistani efforts to sell this episode as a 
<br>"success" story. A South Waziristan-based contact told 
<br>Principal Officer Peshawar on February 24 that Mehsud and 
<br>Nazir are showing signs of getting past old disagreements and 
<br>that "Uzbeks" are re-appearing in growing numbers in the 
<br>area. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) According to Pakistani newspapers, Ahmedzai Wazir 
<br>elders of South Waziristan, who are concerned about the new 
<br>alliance and the possibility of "Uzbeks" coming back into 
<br>their territory, questioned Maulvi Nazir about the deal with 
<br>rival Mehsud. At a meeting in Wana, South Waziristan Maulvi 
<br>Nazir assured the elders that each militant group will 
<br>continue to have its own independent status and remain 
<br>sovereign in their own territory. Nazir explained that the 
<br>alliance was formed "only to act together against the United 
<br>States" because the Taliban was concerned about the troop 
<br>surge in Afghanistan, according to Pakistan press reports. 
<br>The elders publicly cautioned Nazir that they would turn 
<br>against him if this new deal brought any harm to their areas. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) While he did not touch on a possible ISI role in 
<br>brokering this new alliance, Habibullah Khan noted that 
<br>pressure has been building on the Pakistani military in the 
<br>Waziristans. The Pakistani military and then Northwest 
<br>Frontier Province Governor Orakzai quietly entered peace 
<br>deals with North Waziristan commanders in December 2007 and 
<br>with Baitullah Mehsud in February 2008 in order to achieve 
<br>relative peace. Those agreements came after a series of high 
<br>profile attacks on the military in the Waziristans, including 
<br>the kidnapping of over 250 security forces by Baitullah 
<br>Mehsud and Jan 2008 fighting at Ladha Fort in South 
<br>Waziristan. While violence directed at the military in the 
<br>Waziristans has been minor in the last few months, Peshawar 
<br>observers regularly note that the military remains concerned 
<br>with its ability to keep a lid on trouble in these two 
<br>agencies. Chief of Army Staff General Kayani believes the 
<br>respite offered by this latest agreement is necessary for his 
<br>stretched forces to continue fighting in Bajaur and Mohmand 
<br>agencies. However, the relative quiet in South and North 
<br>Waziristan has allowed Baitullah Mehsud to increasingly send 
<br>his fighters in other parts of the FATA and Northwest 
<br>Frontier Province, including Swat. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Khan also noted with deep dismay that this 
<br>announcement demonstrates that these militant commanders see 
<br>themselves in a strong enough position to form an alliance 
<br>that takes them one step closer to a formal territorial 
<br>takeover of the Waziristan as an "Islamic Emirate." South 
<br>Waziristan contacts also commented that there is an 
<br>increasing presence of Punjabi militants from Jaish-e 
<br>Muhammad in the Mehsud areas of South Waziristan. (Comment: 
<br>A development if accurate that is almost certainly of concern 
<br>to the Pakistani military. It is significant that Baitullah 
<br>Mehsud's strength and open militancy are drawing fighters 
<br>from places such as southern Punjab.) 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) As this new alliance formed, Mullah Omar ordered 
<br>militants in North and South Waziristan to immediately stop 
<br>their attacks on Pakistani security forces, according to 
<br>press reports. Omar said in a letter to the militants, "If 
<br>anybody really wants to wage jihad, they must fight the U.S. 
<br>and NATO troops inside Afghanistan." The letter also stated 
<br>that Omar was responsible for the agreement between Mehsud, 
<br>Nazir, and Bahadur, and that after this agreement "the 
<br>attacks on Pakistani security forces by the local Taliban 
<br>will decrease if not end completely." Mullah Omar continues 
<br>to exert considerable influence on the militants in South and 
<br>North Waziristan. Halting attacks against Pakistani forces 
<br>may increase the militants' safe haven space in Pakistan, 
<br>allowing the militants to cross the border to attack NATO 
<br>forces in Afghanistan. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Comment: It is too early to predict how effective 
<br>this new alliance will be in launching cross-border attacks 
<br>on U.S./NATO forces, but its formation will provide the group 
<br>with unfettered access to Afghanistan across North and South 
<br>Waziristan. It is another indication that the GOP's tribal 
<br>divide and conquer strategy against militants is not working, 
<br>at least not to our advantage. Pakistan's security forces, 
<br>however, may see limited downsides to an arrangement that 
<br>focuses militant attacks outside of Pakistan.<br>
