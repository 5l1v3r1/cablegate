<br>SUBJECT: (S) REPORTING AND COLLECTION NEEDS: WEST AFRICA 
<br>SAHEL REGION 
<br> 
<br>REF: A. 08 STATE 124337 
<br>     ¶B. 04 STATE 179667 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: CATHERINE BROWN, DAS IPC.  REASON: 1.4(C). 
<br> 
<br> ¶1. (S/NF) This cable provides the full text of the new 
<br>National HUMINT Collection Directive (NHCD) on the West 
<br>Africa Sahel region (paragraph 3-end) as well as a request 
<br>for continued DOS reporting of biographic information 
<br>relating to the West Africa Sahel region (paragraph 2). 
<br> 
<br>¶A. (S/NF) The NHCD below supercedes the NHCD contained in Ref 
<br>B and reflects the results of a recent Washington review of 
<br>reporting and collection needs focused on the West Africa 
<br>Sahel region (Ref A).  The review produced a comprehensive 
<br>list of strategic priorities (paragraph 3) and reporting and 
<br>collection needs (paragraph 4) intended to guide 
<br>participating USG agencies as they allocate resources and 
<br>update plans to collect information on the West Africa Sahel 
<br>region.  The priorities should also serve as a useful tool to 
<br>help the Embassy manage reporting and collection, including 
<br>formulation of Mission Strategic Plans (MSPs). 
<br> 
<br>¶B. (S/NF) This NHCD is compliant with the National 
<br>Intelligence Priorities Framework (NIPF), which was 
<br>established in response to NSPD-26 of February 24, 2003.  If 
<br>needed, GRPO can provide further background on the NIPF and 
<br>the use of NIPF abbreviations (shown in parentheses following 
<br>each sub-issue below) in NHCDs. 
<br> 
<br>¶C. (S/NF) Important information often is available to 
<br>non-State members of the Country Team whose agencies 
<br>participated in the review of this National HUMINT Collection 
<br>Directive.  COMs, DCMs, and State reporting officers can 
<br>assist by coordinating with other Country Team members to 
<br>encourage relevant reporting through their own or State 
<br>Department channels. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S/NF) State biographic reporting: 
<br> 
<br>¶A. (S/NF) The intelligence community relies on State 
<br>reporting officers for much of the biographical information 
<br>collected worldwide.  Informal biographic reporting via email 
<br>and other means is vital to the community's collection 
<br>efforts and can be sent to the INR/B (Biographic) office for 
<br>dissemination to the IC. 
<br> 
<br>¶B. (S/NF) Reporting officers should include as much of the 
<br>following information as possible when they have information 
<br>relating to persons linked to the West Africa Sahel region: 
<br>office and organizational titles; names, position titles and 
<br>other information on business cards; numbers of telephones, 
<br>cell phones, pagers and faxes; compendia of contact 
<br>information, such as telephone directories (in compact disc 
<br>or electronic format if available) and e-mail listings; 
<br>internet and intranet "handles", internet e-mail addresses, 
<br>web site identification-URLs; credit card account numbers; 
<br>frequent flyer account numbers; work schedules, and other 
<br>relevant biographical information. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S/NF) Priority issues and issues outline: 
<br> 
<br>This directive covers eight countries of Sahelian West 
<br>Africa: Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Chad, The Gambia, Mali, 
<br>Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal.  The coastal countries to the 
<br>south (Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cote 
<br>d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, and Benin) are covered separately in 
<br>the West Africa Littoral directive.
