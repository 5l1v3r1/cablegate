<br>SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR EXPLANATION OF RETURNED DETAINEE ARM DISABILITY 
<br>
<br>REF: A) STATE 135205; B) STATE 127608; C) JOHNSON-STEVENS/GODFREY E-MAIL 10/15/07; D) TRIPOLI 797; E) TRIPOLI 723 AND PREVIOUS 
<br>
<br>CLASSIFIED BY: J. Chris Stevens, DCM, U.S. Embassy Tripoli, Dept 
<br>of State. 
<br>REASON: 1.4 (c), (d) 
<br>¶1. (S/NF) Charge met November 1 with MFA Secretary for the 
<br>Americas Dr. Ahmed Fituri and reiterated Post's request for 
<br>timely access to returned Guantanamo detainee ISN-194 (Muhammad 
<br>Abdallah Mansur al-Rimi) to follow up on ref A and B requests 
<br>for further information on when and how al-Rimi sustained an 
<br>injury to his left arm and suffered the loss of several teeth. 
<br>The CDA also requested access to ISN-557 (Ben Qumu Abu Sufian 
<br>Ibrahim Ahmed Hamouda), who was returned to Libya September 26, 
<br>to assess his condition. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) Fituri stressed that it has been made clear that the 
<br>ostensibly non-governmental Qadhafi Development Foundation 
<br>(QDF), headed by Saif al-Islam al-Qadhafi, has the lead on 
<br>facilitating access to returned detainees. He implied that the 
<br>MFA was not in a position to offer further assistance and 
<br>recommended that the CDA contact directly the QDF's Executive 
<br>Director, Dr. Yusuf Sawani, and possibly ESO Chief Musa Kusa to 
<br>follow up on the request for access to ISN-194 and ISN-557. The 
<br>CDA pushed back, acknowledging that while the QDF has been 
<br>designated as the organization responsible for facilitating 
<br>Watchdog Committee access to returned detainees, the GOL's MFA 
<br>also has a role to play in helping to ensure that such access is 
<br>granted. Fituri offered no substantive rejoinder. Post has not 
<br>been successful in its subsequent attempts to reach Dr. Sawani 
<br>or our other QDF interlocutors. (Note: Sawani and other Libyan 
<br>contacts are typically only reached by mobile telephone as many 
<br>of their offices lack functioning landlines. Post suspects, but 
<br>cannot confirm, that Sawani and his QDF colleagues are not 
<br>taking our numerous calls to avoid having to discuss this issue. 
<br>End note.) 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) Comment: CDA met with Dr. Sawani in mid-September to 
<br>request access to ISN-194 to follow up on ref B request for 
<br>further information on the nature of his left hand disability 
<br>and tooth loss. Sawani said QDF employees (NFI) conducted a 
<br>"pre-interview" of ISN-194 in mid-September in anticipation of a 
<br>second visit by Emboffs (first visit reported ref E) and were 
<br>told by the detainee that he sustained an injury to his left arm 
<br>during interrogation at GTMO. Post notes that the first (and 
<br>only) visit to ISN-194 came after two and a half months of 
<br>negotiation with the GOL and the QDF. Post notes that the GOL 
<br>has expressed a strong desire for access to all/all Libyan 
<br>national detainees remaining in GTMO (ref D), and recommends 
<br>that such access be explicitly conditioned on the GOL's 
<br>facilitation of the requested visits with ISN-194 and ISN-557. 
<br>End comment.
