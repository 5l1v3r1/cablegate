<br>SUBJECT: ICRC: TREATMENT OF PRISONERS IN MOI FACILITIES A 
<br>CONCERN 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Robert F. Godec for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
<br>
<br>------ 
<br>Summary 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) The International Red Cross Committee Regional 
<br>(ICRC) Delegate Yves Arnoldy told the Ambassador ICRC 
<br>priorities in Tunisia are overcrowding in general and 
<br>treatment of prisoners in MOI facilities. The ICRC has a good 
<br>working relationship with the Ministry of Justice, but the 
<br>Ministry of Interior will take more time. He confirmed that 
<br>the ICRC has access to some notified MOI facilities and was 
<br>trying to get information about non-notified facilities. He 
<br>also said, if offered the chance to make a recommendation 
<br>about the transfer of Tunisian detainees held in Guantanamo 
<br>back to Tunisia that he, "would not like to be in the 
<br>Ambassador's place." End Summary. 
<br>
<br>--------------------- 
<br>Guantanamo Detainees 
<br>--------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) The Ambassador met recently with ICRC Delegate Yves 
<br>Arnoldy to obtain an update on the organization's activities 
<br>in Tunisia and the region. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) Discussing the Guantanamo detention facility, the 
<br>Ambassador stressed President Obama's intention to close the 
<br>facility by the end of the year. He said the question of 
<br>transferring the Tunisian detainees back to Tunisia was under 
<br>review in Washington and asked what Arnoldy would recommend 
<br>if he had the opportunity. Arnoldy responded, obliquely 
<br>saying, it was a difficult decision and he "would not like to 
<br>be in the Ambassador's place." He asked to be kept informed 
<br>about the status of any potential transferees because ICRC is 
<br>in touch with their families in Tunisia and will keep them 
<br>informed. ICRC will also be testing a video conferencing 
<br>capability soon to improve communications between detainees 
<br>still in Guantanamo and their families. 
<br>
<br>--------------- 
<br>ICRC Activities 
<br>--------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) Arnoldy said the ICRC is focused on the long-term 
<br>in Tunisia. It was only allowed access to prisoners in 2005. 
<br>It is a question of building trust, which takes time, but 
<br>relations have reached an, "interesting level with solid 
<br>ground for development particularly with the Ministry of 
<br>Justice." The ICRC has two tracks it is working on, 
<br>overcrowding in general, and treatment of prisoners in 
<br>facilities under MOI control. 
<br>
<br>------------------ 
<br>Relations with MOJ 
<br>------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) Arnoldy said the ICRC relations with the Ministry 
<br>of Justice are cooperative. He had direct contact whenever 
<br>he needed it with his interlocutors up to the Minister, and 
<br>there were clear signs of political will to cooperate on 
<br>prison inspections. The MOJ is ready to take advantage of 
<br>the resources ICRC has to offer and is becoming interested in 
<br>a dialogue on wider issues of justice. He could see 
<br>possibilities to develop activities with the MOJ beyond just 
<br>treatment of prisoners to a more strategic, structural level, 
<br>including training of staff and exchange of ideas with other 
<br>national systems. When asked by the Ambassador if he could 
<br>confirm if the MOI had access to prisoners held in MOJ 
<br>facilities he said he could not add any information to this, 
<br>but then added, that certain ministries have the ability to 
<br>affect the MOJ system. 
<br>
<br>------------------- 
<br>Relations with MOI 
<br>------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) Arnoldy characterized ICRC relations with the MOI 
<br>as "needing improvement." The ICRC is taking a step-by-step 
<br>approach and the level of dialogue has made some progress 
<br>since the beginning. However, changing treatment is a 
<br>long-term issue that will entail changes in the MOJ's 
<br>attitude and "mentality." The ICRC is seeking to improve the 
<br>dialogue and develop the basis for adding more substance. 
<br>Arnoldy confirmed that the ICRC has access to "notified" MOI 
<br>facilities and was trying to get information about 
<br>"non-notified" facilities. 
<br>
<br>---------------------- 
<br>Relations with the MFA 
<br>---------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Arnoldy said he has to double track his meeting 
<br>requests with the Ministry of Justice via diplomatic note to 
<br>the MFA however the MFA does not block or delay his requests. 
<br>He noted that his relationship with the MFA had declined 
<br>somewhat after the departure of Hatem Ben Salim who was the 
<br>Secretary of State for European Affairs until 2008. 
<br>
<br>------------------------ 
<br>NGO Reports of Treatment 
<br>------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶8. (S/NF) The Ambassador asked Arnoldy for his impression of 
<br>the reliability of information on treatment of prisoners 
<br>provided by NGOs and others without direct access to the 
<br>prisoners. He asked if the ICRC questioned their public 
<br>statements about treatment. Arnoldy said, it is difficult 
<br>for NGOs and others to know exactly what is happening and 
<br>third hand sourcing has its problems. Not everything they 
<br>say is accurate, but it is a source of information. They 
<br>often give him tips that he can follow-up on or verify and 
<br>sometimes they do have good sources, especially through 
<br>contact with prisoners' families. 
<br>
<br>------------------ 
<br>Regional Activities 
<br>------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶9. (S/NF) The Ambassador asked for an overview of the ICRC 
<br>office's regional activities, which Arnoldy is responsible 
<br>for, in brief: 
<br>
<br>-- Libya - Relations are difficult. Arnoldy has a hard time 
<br>visiting Libya because of his Swiss passport and the strained 
<br>relations between Libya and Switzerland. ICRC depends on 
<br>Tunisian staff going to Libya or Libyans coming to Tunisia. 
<br>
<br>-- Mauritania - The ICRC has signed a headquarters agreement 
<br>with Mauritania upgrading their status to a mission but the 
<br>office will still answer to the Tunis office. There are 
<br>approximately 1,200 prisoners in Mauritania. 
<br>
<br>-- Morocco - ICRC has a presence in Morocco but does not 
<br>have any diplomatic status. Therefore the Morocco office 
<br>focuses on issues of international humanitarian law. The 
<br>rest of ICRC activities are handled through the Tunis office. 
<br>Morocco is the biggest file in the region, concerned mainly 
<br>individuals who "disappeared" as a result of the Western 
<br>Sahara conflict. ICRC is discussing up-grading its status 
<br>with the government of Morocco, it is just a question of 
<br>time. When they reach an agreement, ICRC will likely open 
<br>several offices in Morocco which will not be dependent on the 
<br>Tunis office. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (U) Arnoldy expressed the ICRC's appreciation for USG 
<br>support for the organization. The ICRC depends on donors to 
<br>support it so it can react quickly in a crisis and not wait 
<br>until it has confirmed funding before taking action. 
<br>
<br>------- 
<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶11. (S/NF) Arnoldy was as frank as he could be given the 
<br>confidentiality policy of the ICRC. It was clear that he was 
<br>not positive about the prison conditions in the MOI 
<br>facilities nor about the MOI's attitude toward cooperating 
<br>with the ICRC. He did say however, that some progress had 
<br>been made in the ICRC-MOI dialogue but that it would take 
<br>time. Given that ICRC is the only international organization 
<br>with reliable access to the prisons, we have to give weight 
<br>to their comments, even if cryptic.
