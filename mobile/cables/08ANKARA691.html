<br> 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: AMBASSADOR ROSS WILSON FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (c) Summary:  The closure case against Turkey's ruling 
<br>Justice and Development Party (AKP) is a blow to this 
<br>country's future.  It reflects unresolved conflicts about the 
<br>nature of Turkey, the state, the extent of popular democracy 
<br>and the role of religion in society.  It also results from 
<br>failed leadership by PM Erdogan over the nine months since 
<br>his re-election victory last July.  The outcome is uncertain, 
<br>but the crisis here must be viewed through the peculiar 
<br>entity that is Turkish democracy -- imperfect, crabbed, but 
<br>functional in its way.  US priorities are sustaining our 
<br>ability to work with this country on mutual interests and 
<br>supporting its democratic process in a broad sense, but we 
<br>should avoid opining on the specifics of Turkish politics. 
<br>This approach will respect the raucous and historic debate 
<br>and politicking among Turks taking place now about the future 
<br>of their country -- a vital process for democracy here to 
<br>continue to mature.  End Summary. 
<br> 
<br>Implications of the Closure Case 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (c) Here is one way of looking at the AKP closure case. 
<br>It is an attempted judicial coup, a Clausewitz-like extension 
<br>of politics by legal means.  The indictment reads like a 
<br>political tract.  It relies on newspaper clippings to justify 
<br>excluding the party and 70-odd leaders from politics.  Among 
<br>more bizarre bits of proof that the AKP intends to undo 
<br>secularism are press reports of Secretary Powell praising the 
<br>country,s "moderate Muslim" government and on its support 
<br>for BMENA.  The propriety of banning parties is questionable 
<br>in any democracy.  A ban based on a legally weak indictment 
<br>of a party which nine months ago received 47 percent of the 
<br>vote nationally and pluralities in 76 out of Turkey's 85 
<br>constituencies looks like a travesty for democratic values 
<br>and the rule of law. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (c) Another way of looking at the case focuses on its 
<br>consistency with democracy Turkish style.  The constitution 
<br>and laws have long provided for banning politicians and 
<br>dissolving parties, 26 of which have fallen victim.  The AKP 
<br>had many years in office to change this and other 
<br>questionable policies (like Article 301 on insulting 
<br>Turkishness), but did not.  What looks to Western democracies 
<br>like an unusual power in the judiciary to compromise the 
<br>results of last July's election is one of Turkey's check and 
<br>balancing mechanisms to protect the rights of the minority -- 
<br>in this case secularists who feel threatened by the AKP. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (c) Some truth exists in both of these points of view. 
<br>One clear thing is that PM Erdogan has stumbled badly.  One 
<br>blunder was failing to make political bans more difficult 
<br>when relevant legislation was amended several years ago.  As 
<br>if dizzy with his own success, Erdogan failed to reassure the 
<br>53 percent who voted against his government last July that it 
<br>would respect their interests too.  He failed to use his 
<br>re-election mandate to continue EU-related reforms that were 
<br>the most formidable tools for calming fears of Islamization 
<br>and untrammeled majority rule.  He allowed himself to be 
<br>goaded by the National Action Party (MHP) into putting the 
<br>headscarf ban at the head of the reform queue.  For this 
<br>short-term populist win, he sacrificed a larger 
<br>constitutional reform package that would have significantly 
<br>strengthened Turkey's democracy.  Effective, progressive 
<br>governance that was the hallmark of early AKP years in office 
<br>dried up in the 2007 election year, and no momentum returned 
<br>after that.  These and other missteps exacerbated fears among 
<br>many that Erdogan was going too far, too fast; that there 
<br>were no effective constraints on the AKP (especially after 
<br>the military's botched intervention last spring); and that 
<br>fundamentalists might soon dominate the bureaucracy, 
<br>judiciary, universities, etc., to change Turkey in dangerous 
<br>and permanent ways. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (c) The closure case on its face is a set-back for 
<br>democracy and stability in Turkey.  For many, especially the 
<br>large swath of previously neglected voters who make up 
<br>Turkey's emerging middle class and whom Erdogan's populism 
<br>galvanized, the message is that Turkish democracy is too 
<br>poorly developed to protect their interests against the 
<br>traditional elite.  This message is even more threatening to 
<br> 
<br>ANKARA 00000691  002 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>those here who are still marginalized, especially Kurds. 
<br>More broadly, the case looks like, and to some extent is, the 
<br>revenge of an unelected and unaccountable bureaucracy against 
<br>Erdogan and popular democracy.  Turks fear the Deep State and 
<br>many, including strong critics of the AKP, are deeply 
<br>uncomfortable with the judiciary's attempt to manipulate the 
<br>power balance.  Associated turmoil also renders Turkey's 
<br>vulnerable economy more uncertain at a time when global 
<br>trends are already very negative; a big downturn would 
<br>reinforce the sense of crisis here. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (c) Today, however, Turkey remains a secure, relatively 
<br>stable emerging democracy.  There is no serious violence on 
<br>the streets, and the economy has not crashed.  The closure 
<br>case is not a catastrophe or the undoing of Turkey's peculiar 
<br>and imperfect democracy, at least not now.  It is better seen 
<br>as one among many moves in a very long chess game that all 
<br>sides here, including Erdogan and the AKP, are adept at 
<br>playing.  The mere fact of the indictment has already 
<br>moderated the AKP's rhetoric and pushed it to emphasize 
<br>effective governance and more consensual policies, especially 
<br>EU accession-related reform.  It is only a slight 
<br>exaggeration to say that this is the way Turkey's crabbed, 
<br>military-drafted constitution intended the system to work. 
<br>Figures ranging from former President Demirel to former 
<br>parliamentary Speaker Cetin have remarked to us recently that 
<br>Turkey has seen worse and will come through these 
<br>difficulties all right.  At this point, at least, their 
<br>reassurances seem more justified than not. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (c) How matters will play out in the short-medium term is 
<br>uncertain. 
<br> 
<br>-- A "victorious" AKP will still face intransigent opposition 
<br>from one-third of the public, not to mention the courts, 
<br>bureaucrats and generals. 
<br> 
<br>-- A post-closure AKP will reorganize under a new name and 
<br>almost certainly still have the votes among its un-banned MPs 
<br>to form the next government alone.  People already talk about 
<br>plausible, post-closure scenarios that involve bringing 
<br>Erdogan and other potentially banned figures back into the 
<br>picture. 
<br> 
<br>-- Banishing the AKP will not change the reality that the 
<br>main opposition parties are weak, divided and ill-equipped 
<br>for 21st century politics.  Space may be created for a new 
<br>centrist party, but credible leaders are not evident now, and 
<br>the outlook for new elections that would propel them to 
<br>prominence is uncertain.  The Islamist fringe in and outside 
<br>the AKP could coalesce and become more radical; tarikats like 
<br>the Gulenists may become more significant power centers than 
<br>they are now. 
<br> 
<br>Without broad constitutional reform to replace the current 
<br>top-down state and better protect individual liberties, and 
<br>without more consensus on the extent and limits of secularism 
<br>in modern Turkey, this struggle is likely to continue. 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (c) This episode will last at least six months and 
<br>possibly a year or more.  In the meantime, Turkey's 
<br>leadership will be distracted and cautious.  Unfortunately, 
<br>this comes during a period of immense challenges to and 
<br>opportunities for Turkish interests domestically and in the 
<br>region that include the Kurdish issue, relations with Iraq 
<br>and the KRG, energy security, Cyprus, Armenia, EU accession, 
<br>terrorism, etc.  Policy creativity, never Turkey's strong 
<br>suit, will diminish.  We also note that before the 
<br>Constitutional Court decides the AKP's fate, it will likely 
<br>rule on the headscarf amendments; reinstituting the ban at 
<br>universities may actually calm matters and defuse the 
<br>anti-AKP case.  The Court may also rule on the closure of the 
<br>Kurdish nationalist Democratic Society Party (DTP); this 
<br>could prove more explosive than the AKP case, given that DTP 
<br>leaders and constituents accept much less of the 
<br>constitutional/legal order here than the AKP mainstream. 
<br> 
<br>Our Public Posture 
<br>------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (c) None of this changes the reality that Turkey is an 
<br>extremely important ally in a dangerous region and that it 
<br> 
<br>ANKARA 00000691  003 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>is, despite many faults, more democratic and free than any 
<br>other country in the Muslim world.  We should not stifle, 
<br>through our intervention, what should fundamentally be a 
<br>debate by Turks about the future of their country that is 
<br>essential if its democratic institutions are to mature. 
<br>Doing so would make this a US issue in ways harmful to our 
<br>interests, our influence and to democratic values here.  We 
<br>should stick to general principles, and let Turks sort out 
<br>the details.  At some point, as matters develop, our 
<br>intervention to head off a political meltdown here may be 
<br>necessary, but that moment isn't now and may well never come. 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (c) With this in mind, our public comments should take a 
<br>positive and high road.  We should: 
<br> 
<br>-- Make clear our strong support for Turkey, its democratic 
<br>institutions and its commitment to democratic values and 
<br>secular principles that define our alliance and partnership. 
<br> 
<br>-- Urge Turkey's leaders and institutions to work for 
<br>pragmatic solutions that reinforce stability and build 
<br>consensus at a critical time for the country and in the 
<br>region. 
<br> 
<br>-- Emphasize support for Turkey's goal of accession to the EU 
<br>and its need to legislate and implement comprehensive 
<br>political and economic reforms that will sustain that goal 
<br>and secure liberty and prosperity in the future. 
<br> 
<br>-- Look forward to continuing to work with Turkey on behalf 
<br>of common interests in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Caucasus, the 
<br>Balkans, on terrorism, on energy security, on the Cyprus 
<br>problem and elsewhere in the region and the world.
