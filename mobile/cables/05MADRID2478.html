<br>SUBJECT: SPAIN: AMBASSADOR AGUIRRE'S MEETING WITH FM
<br>MORATINOS
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre; reasons 1.4 (B) and (D)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: One day after his June 27 arrival in Spain,
<br>US Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre met with Foreign Minister
<br>Moratinos to lay the groundwork for a new relationship after
<br>a year of difficult relations with the Socialist government,
<br>but also to make clear US concerns about Spanish policy
<br>toward Venezuela and Cuba and the lingering wounds in
<br>Washington over the Zapatero government's harsh rhetoric on
<br>Iraq and US electoral politics last year. Ambassador Aguirre
<br>urged Moratinos to undertake high level public statements to
<br>educate the Spanish public about the government's support for
<br>and active role in Iraq reconstruction and democratization,
<br>despite the withdrawal of Spanish troops. Moratinos took
<br>note of this suggestion, underscoring Spanish financial
<br>support for Iraq reconstruction, training of Iraqi security
<br>forces and assistance in judicial training. Moratinos told
<br>Aguirre he wants to work closely with him to avoid
<br>misperceptions and misunderstandings between the two
<br>countries. END SUMMARY
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Ambassador Aguirre thanked Moratinos for the warm
<br>welcome he had received already from the Spanish government,
<br>and for the speed in which the Spanish government has enabled
<br>him to get started. Copies of his letters of credence were
<br>accepted upon arrival, enabling his meeting with Moratinos to
<br>focus on substance rather than courtesies. The King had
<br>agreed to include him in a June 29 Ambassadorial credentials
<br>ceremony at the Royal Palace, which opens the door for an
<br>early meeting with President Zapatero. The Ambassador told
<br>Moratinos that this quick start fit with his personal style
<br>and his desire to be active as the face and the voice of
<br>US-Spain relations. Ambassador Aguirre underscored to
<br>Moratinos he plans to engage the Spanish public and press as
<br>well as the government to convey US views and explain US
<br>policies. He said President Bush, NSC Advisor Hadley and
<br>Secretary Rice want him to turn a new, fresh page in the
<br>
<br>SIPDIS
<br>relationship, with the Ambassador as the face and voice of
<br>the Administration. The Ambassador invited Moratinos to join
<br>him as a partner in this endeavor.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Moratinos welcomed the Ambassador's active approach
<br>and said that the Spanish government had wanted to ensure a
<br>rapid start to his tenure in Madrid. King Juan Carlos
<br>personally decided to include the Ambassador in the
<br>already-scheduled June 29 credentials ceremony for several
<br>other Ambassadors, even though these ceremonies usually take
<br>place at least a month or more after an Ambassador's arrival
<br>in country.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Ambassador Aguirre,s arrival, Moratinos said,
<br>provides an opportunity to clear up misperceptions about the
<br>Zapatero government's policies and intentions, which had
<br>taken root after the Spanish troop withdrawal and during the
<br>US electoral campaign. Moratinos wants the US to understand
<br>that the Zapatero government seeks to create an atmosphere
<br>with the US of friendship and collegiality, and would like
<br>Washington to understand that his government is not
<br>anti-American nor ideological in its approach. While lines
<br>of communication were good, particularly after the series of
<br>high level meetings such as Moratinos with Secretary Rice and
<br>Defense Minister Bono with Secretary Rumsfeld, Moratinos
<br>hoped the arrival of a new US Ambassador offered the
<br>opportunity to develop a close dialogue and full cooperation
<br>with the Bush Administration. Moratinos said he had
<br>responded to a Spanish TV reporter's question June 27 about
<br>whether Presidents Bush and Zapatero would meet by saying
<br>that he had offered a broad time frame for a possible meeting
<br>within the tenure of the current Spanish legislature (which
<br>has at least 3 more years to go). Moratinos said he hoped
<br>that relations by then would have improved to such an extent
<br>that such a meeting could be possible.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) On Venezuela and Cuba, Moratinos worried that our
<br>policy differences had contributed to misperceptions between
<br>Washington and Madrid. He told the Ambassador that Spain
<br>shared U.S. objectives aimed its policies toward results and
<br>deeds. He urged cooperation between Spain and the US on
<br>these and other Latin America issues, which would have a
<br>significant force-multiplying effect. On the positive side,
<br>Moratinos pointed to Spain's full support and leadership role
<br>in Afghanistan as a major positive element in our
<br>relationship. As an example, Moratinos noted Defense
<br>Minister Bono's appearance in the Spanish Parliament June 22
<br>to announce additional troop deployments to support
<br>legislative elections there.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Ambassador Aguirre said his focus would be on tangible
<br>results in the relationship and would not measure success by
<br>high-level visits (which he also stressed to the Spanish
<br>press after the meeting). The Ambassador urged Moratinos to
<br>work with him to turn our difficulties over Cuba and
<br>Venezuela into a net positive in our relationship, by
<br>remaining on the same page and avoiding steps that legitimize
<br>and encourage Chavez and Castro.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) On Iraq, the Ambassador told Moratinos that while the
<br>US had put the troop withdrawal issue behind us, there
<br>remained considerable lingering concern and irritation over
<br>the Zapatero government's rhetoric in the months following
<br>the withdrawal and during the US electoral campaign. This
<br>irritation will not easily dissipate but could be
<br>ameliorated, the Ambassador suggested, by new, positive
<br>public rhetoric by Zapatero and his team emphasizing that
<br>Spain recognizes progress made in Iraq. New Spanish rhetoric
<br>could note that Spain, along with the United States is now
<br>focused on the here and now and the future of Iraq, including
<br>reconstruction, democratization and capacity-building for
<br>Iraqi security forces. Such statements, aimed at educating
<br>the Spanish public about current goals and objectives in Iraq
<br>rather than dwelling on the past, would be noticed and
<br>welcomed in Washington. Moratinos said he would "take good
<br>note" of this advice, underscoring Spain's active role in
<br>providing financial support for reconstruction and
<br>development, training Iraqi security forces and judicial and
<br>related training.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Ambassador Aguirre pointed to the Middle East and
<br>North Africa as areas in which the US and Spain shared common
<br>objectives and as ripe for opportunities to work together.
<br>Moratinos agreed, welcoming Secretary Rice's activism in the
<br>region. It would be very useful, Moratinos said, if all of
<br>the players in Washington, the EU and its members, the
<br>Quartet, could unify their messages both to Israel and the
<br>Palestinians. In North Africa, Moratinos said that
<br>competition among the players does not have to be the norm
<br>and that there is space for all, including in the area of
<br>commercial interests such as in oil and natural gas. He
<br>urged the development of a common strategic vision in this
<br>region.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) In a one-on-one session after the meeting, Moratinos
<br>again underscored to the Ambassador his government's desire
<br>to avoid misunderstandings with the United States and to open
<br>a new chapter in the relationship. The Ambassador said that
<br>he would work toward this end, but would also be frank but
<br>constructive about policy differences.
