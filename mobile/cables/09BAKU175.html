<br> 
<br>Summary 
<br>--------- 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (S)  According to widespread rumor, many Iranians in Baku 
<br>are involved full- or part-time in Iranian regime-related 
<br>profit making, sanctions-busting, money laundering, and 
<br>similar activities.  Activities range from assisting Iranian 
<br>interests "on the side" of pursuing private activities, to 
<br>working primarily for Iranian government entities.  These 
<br>Iranians' formal businesses in Azerbaijan include factories, 
<br>construction companies, trading companies, and shops, some of 
<br>which may be hollow companies hiding illicit or semi-licit 
<br>activities.  Some are also said to be significant actors in 
<br>obtaining spare parts and equipment for the Revolutionary 
<br>Guard, raising revenues and managing money for it and/or 
<br>regime figures, or managing Iran-origin narcotics 
<br>trafficking.  The list is a "sampler" of the types of 
<br>personnel and activities singled out to Iran watcher by 
<br>multiple sources as actively involved in Iranian 
<br>regime-supportive financial and procurement activities.  The 
<br>list suggests the extensive and complex interconnection of 
<br>Iranian figures and activities that reportedly support 
<br>Iranian security organizations and regime figures.  End 
<br>Summary. 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (S) Baku Iran watcher received the information below from 
<br>a wide variety of independent Iranian and Azerbaijani sources 
<br>(strictly protect), including Baku-based Iranian students, 
<br>business figures, and human rights activists; a Tehran-based 
<br>Iranian exporter; a prominent businessman working in Iran; 
<br>the Executive Director of AmCham in Azerbaijan; an 
<br>Azerbaijani oil company executive; and a local partner in a 
<br>leading international management consulting firm.  In almost 
<br>all cases the information below was related/confirmed 
<br>separately by at least three of the above sources. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (S) Please note that, while serious efforts have been 
<br>made to cross-check the information below and ignore 
<br>"indirect" claims, Iran watcher has no independent ability to 
<br>verify these allegations.  Although some of these figures are 
<br>well known in Baku and/or among the resident Iranian 
<br>community, Baku Iran watcher has never met any of them.  The 
<br>information below should be interpreted in this context. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (S) Begin List: 
<br> 
<br>¶A.  (S) Jamal Allavi.  Three Iranian sources claimed that 
<br>Allavi is a close relative of the ex-Mayor of Ardebil, and a 
<br>former colleague/friend of President Ahmedinajad.  He now 
<br>runs several Iranian companies (mostly trading), and is the 
<br>head of a provincial cooperative organization "Tavanee 
<br>Marzneshinan Fedayan Velayat," entitled to export and import 
<br>items with reduced restrictions.  Allavi has a house in Baku 
<br>and frequently travels on business to Azerbaijan, Russia, 
<br>China, and Kazakhstan.  He uses his businesses as a cover for 
<br>procuring and importing military spare parts and other items 
<br>needed by the Revolutionary Guard and other Iranian security 
<br>forces, bribing customs officials as necessary.  A fourth 
<br>Iranian source noted that, while he did not know Allavi, the 
<br>company name is a "giveaway" of Revolutionary Guard/regime 
<br>connections. 
<br> 
<br>¶B.  (S) FNU "Lotfi".  Runs a large artificial leather factory 
<br>in Ardebil ("Kharkhaneye Charmeh Masnui)", and other 
<br>businesses based in Iranian Azerbaijan.  He is a close 
<br>associate of Jamal Allavi (entry "A" above), with whom he 
<br>cooperates in smuggling activities.  He is an officer in the 
<br>Revolutionary Guard (possibly retired), and his businesses 
<br>are actually Revolutionary Guard-owned.  He travels to 
<br>Malaysi, Singapore, Dubai, Turkey, and Iraq as well as 
<br>zerbaijan on Revolutionary Guard business.  He als assists 
<br>Revolutionary Guard and/or Iranian intelligence operations by 
<br>"getting for them what they need," including communications 
<br>equipment and technical information. 
<br> 
<br>¶C.  (S) Adil Sharabiani.  An Iranian currency exchange dealer 
<br>with "close links" to Tehran.  He was formerly a manager of 
<br> 
<br>BAKU 00000175  002 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Bank Melli Iran, and currently has a close business 
<br>relationship with the Xalq Bank, a medium-sized bank in Baku. 
<br> He came to Azerbaijan after going bankrupt in Iran under 
<br>murky circumstances.  He is wealthy and reportedly works 
<br>closely with the Iranian "Foundation for the Oppressed" 
<br>(Banyadeh Mostazafan), overseeing its business and investment 
<br>activities in Azerbaijan, and advising the management of the 
<br>Foundation-owned Darya Soap Detergent company in Azerbaijan 
<br>(headed by one "Farzandeh").  He also assists another Iranian 
<br>foundation that is providing financial assistance to 
<br>Azerbaijani refugees from Karabagh with up to 300 Manat per 
<br>family per month (about $350). 
<br> 
<br>An Iranian contact said that a friend had recently witnessed 
<br>Sharabiani delivering five million dollars in cash "from 
<br>Iran" to the Bank of Baku that was not entered on the books. 
<br>The Iranian source did not know whether the money represented 
<br>a personal payment to Sharabiani or a disbursement entrusted 
<br>to him for some other purpose.  The anti-regime source 
<br>alleged that Sharabiani "periodically" makes such deliveries 
<br>to the Bank.  An Iranian businessman separately told Iran 
<br>watcher that Sharabiani has "very good relations" with the 
<br>Iranian government, and is widely assumed by other Iranians 
<br>to be assisting both regime organizations and individual 
<br>regime/clerical figures in investment and money laundering 
<br>activities. 
<br> 
<br>Note: The Xalq Bank was established using former staff of the 
<br>Bank of Baku (see 'E" below).  It is one of the most popular 
<br>Baku banking venues in Azerbaijan for Iranian businesses and 
<br>Iranians in Iran.  Two other popular banks for Iranians are 
<br>the "Royal Bank of Baku," owned by an Iranian-American (ref 
<br>C), and the "Bank of Baku."  End Note). 
<br> 
<br>¶D.  (S) Kamal Darvishi.  This individual and his three 
<br>brothers were famous fighters during the Iran-Iraq war. 
<br>Kamil  rose to the rank of General in the Revolutionary 
<br>Guard, and formerly had important Teheran-area security and 
<br>intelligence duties.  He and his brother Keyoumars began 
<br>coming to Azerbaijan regularly ten years ago.  Although from 
<br>a very poor family, they are both extremely wealthy.  Kamal 
<br>owns several road and other infrastructure construction 
<br>companies in Iran, and formerly effectively controlled much 
<br>of this sector in Iran (according to a Teheran businessman, 
<br>"no roads in Iran could be built without him or his friends 
<br>as a partner.)" 
<br> 
<br>Darvishi formerly ran the "NASR" company, an alleged 
<br>Revolutionary Guard-controlled business in Iran.  Some of his 
<br>business activities and networking reportedly aroused 
<br>suspicion, resulting in his official "retirement" from the 
<br>Revolutionary Guard.  In recent years Darvishi has developed 
<br>a close business relationship/friendship with Azerbaijan 
<br>Minister of Transportation Ziya Mammedov, and  with 
<br>Mammedov's assistance has won at least eight major road 
<br>construction and rehabilitation contracts, including 
<br>contracts for construction of the Baku-Iranian Astara 
<br>highway, the Baku-Guba highway, and the BaQ ring highway. 
<br>(Comment: We assume Mammedov is a silent partner in these 
<br>contracts.  Mammedov's immediate family owns Azerbaijan's 
<br>largest commercial development company, and he is notoriously 
<br>corrupt even for Azerbaijan.  Iran watcher has heard many 
<br>allegations from Azerbaijani contacts of creative corrupt 
<br>practices involving highway construction here.  End Comment). 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Iranian business and student contacts asserted that Darvishi 
<br>maintains close relations with the Revolutionary Guard and 
<br>Iranian intelligence.  Two noted that he travels freely 
<br>abroad, in violation of ten-year legal limitations on 
<br>personal foreign travel by retired senior Revolutionary Guard 
<br>officers.  An Iranian student reported that Darvishi is 
<br>recruiting among Iranian students in Azerbaijan for work in a 
<br>new company he is establishing here. 
<br> 
<br>¶E.  (S) Jamsheed "Jushkar" Mahmudoglu. He and his brothers 
<br>are Iranian Azerbaijanis who have obtained Turkish 
<br>citizenship.  They are large shareholders in the Bank of 
<br>Baku, which is sometimes presented as a "Turkish bank."  They 
<br>are originally from Tabriz, where the family were wealthy 
<br>gold and currency dealers who lost their business after the 
<br>Iranian Revolution.  The family fled to Turkey and ultimately 
<br> 
<br>BAKU 00000175  003 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>obtained Turkish passports.  Their business deals in 
<br>Azerbaijan and Iran are frequently entwined with the Oromi 
<br>brothers, another former Tabrizi-now-Turkish family active in 
<br>Azerbaijan and Iran.  They and the Oromis set up the Silsila 
<br>General Trading company in Dubai under the aegis of the NAB 
<br>Group.  In Iran they jointly own a company which produces 
<br>boilers on license from a German company (Bosch).  In 
<br>Azerbaijan they cooperated in the establishment of the Baku 
<br>Electronics company and the Bank of Baku (the latter in 
<br>partnership with the family of former Minister of Economic 
<br>Development Farhad Aliyev, see below).  Unlike the Oromis, 
<br>Jamsheed reportedly remains a major shareholder in this bank. 
<br> 
<br>Two Iranian sources repeated "rumors" that this son is 
<br>working with a son of Ayatollah Rafsanjani in several 
<br>business ventures.  Jamsheed has relations with prominent 
<br>Azerbaijani and Iranian business and government figures, and 
<br>allegedly does favors for Iranian government personnel, 
<br>including facilitating of desired foreign items and money 
<br>laundering.  The President of AmCham in Baku (protect) 
<br>confirmed that Jamsheed is a major bank shareholder, and 
<br>originally from Iran.  She nd other sources opined that the 
<br>bank is one of he more "professionally run" in Baku. 
<br>(Comment: The bank is known for its relations with Turkish 
<br>companies.  The Bank of Baku was formerly controlled by the 
<br>brother of Farhad Aliyev, a former Azerbaijani Minister of 
<br>Economic Development who is currently jailed.  According to a 
<br>prominent Azerbaijani business consultant (strictly protect), 
<br>Aliyev's position has been divided between the Azerbaijani 
<br>Minister of Transportation Ziya Mammedov, and the Head of 
<br>Presidential Security, Vahid Akhundov.  End Comment). 
<br> 
<br>¶F.  (S) Shahram Oromi.  An Iranian Azerbaijani who obtained 
<br>Turkish citizenship after the Iranian revolution. 
<br>Nonetheless, he attended university in Iran, graduating from 
<br>Iran Azad university (1993).  He and his brothers Nadir and 
<br>Bahram established the "Turkish" NAB Foreign Trade company 
<br>(Deesh Ticaret Limited Sherkati) in 1988.  The company 
<br>(headquartered in Istanbul) does extensive trading between 
<br>Turkey and the Middle East and Iran.  It is active in 
<br>Azerbaijan, and also present in Russia and other CIS 
<br>countries.  Since 1995 this company has been the distributor 
<br>of Hyundai cars in Azerbaijan, and a member of the family is 
<br>reportedly the Agent for Samsung in Turkey and Azerbaijan. 
<br>The consultant describes the Oromi brother's business mode as 
<br>based on "establishing insider monopolies or advantages via 
<br>relations with powerful government individuals and their 
<br>relatives" in the various countries in which they operate, 
<br>"using bribes, 'gifts,' or offers of a share in their 
<br>business." 
<br> 
<br>The Oromis helped set up the Bank of Baku (see item "E' 
<br>above), and Shahram served in various positions (ranging from 
<br>Chief of the Financial Audit Department to Chairman) between 
<br>1999-2007, however they have recently sold most of their 
<br>shares in this bank to influential Azerbaijanis.  The Oromi's 
<br>allegedly work cooperatively in areas requested by senior 
<br>Iranian figures, and several of their businesses may 
<br>facilitate regime (or regime member) interests.  Shahram was 
<br>and remains close to former Iranian Ambassador to Azerbaijan 
<br>Ahmed Qazai. 
<br> 
<br>¶G.  (S) "Asgar" LNU (commonly known in Baku as "Agaya Asgar). 
<br> His private company is located at #16 Gorbanov Street in 
<br>Baku, next to the Nizami metro station.  His formal business 
<br>is Iran-Russia timber and wood products export/import via 
<br>Azerbaijan.  A native of Iranian Azerbaijan, Asgar has an 
<br>Azerbaijani wife and has lived in Baku for several years. 
<br>He works closely with political officers based at the Iran 
<br>Culture House (ref B).  His wife is the cousin of the 
<br>Azerbaijani Minister of Education Misir Mardanov, and 
<br>Mardanov's brother is one of his business partners.  Irada 
<br>Afetgizi, an Iranian who helped organize an anti-Israel 
<br>"Islamic world" conference held at the Baku Media Center in 
<br>2007, works in his office.  Asgar owns two homes in Baku and 
<br>hosts visiting Iranian clerics and relatives of Iranian 
<br>regime officials and senior Revolutionary Guard officers.  He 
<br>has close ties to Iranian government and Revolutionary Guard 
<br>organizations and individuals, and assists them in business 
<br>activities.  He often travels to Moscow. 
<br> 
<br>¶H.  (S) Jabrail Naveed "Azerbaijani."  A famous "fixer" for 
<br> 
<br>BAKU 00000175  004 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Iranians in Azerbaijan (hence his nickname).  He was head of 
<br>the Iranian Trader's Association in Azerbaijan until that 
<br>organization closed in the late 1990's.  An Iranian 
<br>manufacturer and exporter from Tehran who has known the 
<br>family for years (strictly protect) noted that "he is very 
<br>wealthy, but doesn't flaunt it."  He said that Naveed's wife 
<br>formerly worked in Iran as an officer in Bank Melli, where 
<br>she facilitated loans to unqualified regime bigwigs and their 
<br>cronies. 
<br> 
<br>Three contacts separately claimed that Naveed has facilitated 
<br>Iran-related energy business ventures with the State Oil 
<br>Company of Azerbaijan (SOCAR), and illicitly exports (falsely 
<br>labeled) Pelite and other oil drilling materials and 
<br>chemicals and propane gas.  Naveed also reportedly owns the 
<br>"Pingvin" iron workshop in Azerbaijan.  The Tehran 
<br>businessman said that Naveed helps facilitate import of 
<br>sanctioned products into Iran from Russia and elsewhere via 
<br>the Azerbaijani enclave of Nakchevan, and said that he 
<br>himself is one of "many" legitimate Iranian exporters who 
<br>have been pressured into cooperating in this activity. 
<br>Naveed is a close friend of the head of Baku's Husseiniya 
<br>("Iranian") mosque, Mullah Ogagnejad, and oversees the 
<br>mosques' administration.  Ogagnejad is a son-in-law of the 
<br>late Ayatollah Meshkini, and the personal religious 
<br>representative of Ayatollah Khameini in Azerbaijan (ref B). 
<br> 
<br>¶I.  (S) Safa Naveed.  Son of Jabrail Naveed (above).  A 
<br>graduate of Baku's Kavkaz university, he is currently a 
<br>Revolutionary Guard officer working at the Iranian Embassy in 
<br>Baku.  He is a leadliaison with Iranian students in 
<br>Azerbaijan.  AnIranian student described Safa's duties as 
<br>"spyig on" Iranian students in Baku, and an Iranian 
<br>businessman who has known the family for years told Iran 
<br>watcher that Safa Naveed has frequently boasted to him about 
<br>his and Iran's knowledge of what goes on in Azerbaijan, 
<br>extensive information networks here, and "ability to get 
<br>anything it needs."  One contact described Safa as 
<br>"fanatically anti-Western." 
<br> 
<br>¶J.  (S) Asgar Jabbari.  One of the "two Asgars" widely known 
<br>among Iranians in Baku (see "F" above).  Son of the late 
<br>"Mullah Natiq," a famous hard-line orator during the Iranian 
<br>revolution and the Iran-Iraq war.  Jabbari's wife is from 
<br>Azerbaijan, he owns a house here, and travels back and forth 
<br>regularly between Iran and Azerbaijan.  His main official 
<br>business is exporting Iranian marble from Isfahan, where he 
<br>works with a large factory, which is actually a Revolutionary 
<br>Guard front company (Note: Iranian marble is commonly used in 
<br>Baku residential and office-building construction, which has 
<br>been undergoing a boom here until recently.  End Note.) 
<br>Jabbari has close business relationships with senior Iranian 
<br>government officials, and carries out business activities and 
<br>buys real estate on their behalf.  (Note: Jabbari's name is 
<br>of Arabic origin, but is more likely to imply religious piety 
<br>than Arabic heritage.  End Note). 
<br> 
<br>¶K.  (S) Sabir Shaheen.  Though reportedly mild-mannered and 
<br>well dressed, Shaheen is a well known mafia-like figure from 
<br>Iranian Azerbaijan who reportedly acts as a "liaison" between 
<br>the Iranian and Russian/Azerbaijani narcotics traffickers. 
<br>Although he officially operates a marble store on Baku's Karl 
<br>Marx street, the store is generally closed and Shaheen 
<br>himself is generally seen holding court at restaurants and 
<br>cafes along 28 May Street.  (Note: Iran reportedly has one of 
<br>the highest per capita rates of heroin addiction in the 
<br>world, and heroin and other narcotics trafficking from Iran 
<br>to Russia and Europe via Azerbaijan has skyrocketed over the 
<br>last two years.  See ref (D).
