<br>REASON: 1.4 (b), (d)
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) Summary: xxxxx are concerned about
<br>the current impasse in the Six-Party Talks, but each varies in
<br>his diagnosis of its causes and prescriptions for U.S. policy.
<br>xxxxx claims that a debate has emerged within the Chinese
<br>leadership over the merits of quick U.S. delisting, as a result
<br>of Pyongyang's allegedly incomplete nuclear declaration. These
<br>xxxxx agree that, for the moment, none of North Korean leader
<br>Kim Jong-il's three sons is likely to be tapped to succeed him.
<br>xxxxx, North Korea in August questions
<br>the World Food Program's (WFP) forecast of an imminent famine
<br>there. END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) xxxxx Korean politics and the
<br>ongoing Six-Party Talks. xxxxx.
<br>
<br>Deadlock over verification
<br>--------------------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) xxxxx are concerned about the current
<br>impasse in the Six-Party Talks, but each varies in his diagnosis
<br>of its causes and prescriptions for U.S. policy. xxxxx
<br>view, Washington is primarily responsible for North Korean
<br>foot-dragging. Under the "action for action" framework, xxxxx
<br>argues, the United States promised to remove North Korea from
<br>the State Sponsors of Terror list and Trading with the Enemy Act
<br>(TWEA) restrictions in return for a complete nuclear declaration
<br>from Pyongyang. After forty days, it became legally possible for
<br>Washington to delist the North Koreans in August, but this did
<br>not occur. xxxxx continues, the United States seems to want
<br>international inspectors to be able to access North Korea's
<br>nuclear sites virtually "at whim," and to meet with its nuclear
<br>scientists. These conditions have given Pyongyang "an excuse for
<br>their present inaction." xxxxx North Korea is "truly
<br>disappointed" with this development -- its leaders believe "they
<br>did something" and are owed something in return -- and, xxxxx
<br>opinion, it is "difficult for the other Six-Party states to
<br>blame them."
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) xxxxx, on the other hand, dissents from this view.
<br>According xxxxx, the nuclear declaration North Korea submitted
<br>in May was incomplete. xxxxx claims that critical information
<br>about secret underwater nuclear facilities located on North
<br>Korea's coast. For this reason, a debate has emerged within the
<br>Chinese leadership over the merits of quick U.S. delisting, xxxxx
<br>continues. One camp believes that continued momentum in the
<br>Six-Party Talks is critical to their success, and has concluded
<br>that Washington must adopt a more flexible attitude. The other
<br>camp, however, has taken the incomplete nuclear declaration as
<br>evidence that the regime in Pyongyang is truly "a ticking time
<br>bomb," and regard Washington's tough stance on verification as a
<br>potential opportunity to finally deal with a persistent regional
<br>irritant.xxxxx does not believe the United States should delist
<br>North Korea yet, though he argues Washington needs to find some
<br>token action it can take now to demonstrate its good faith.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) xxxxx is confident that, if the United States
<br>removes North Korea from the State Sponsors of Terror list and
<br>the TWEA -- even absent progress on a verification protocol --
<br>its negotiators will act quickly to reciprocate and permit some
<br>form of verification. That North Korea has been labeled a state
<br>sponsor of terror is "an ongoing source of embarrassment" for
<br>the regime, xxxxx argues, and Washington must not underestimate
<br>its "desire for face." xxxxx agree that, despite North
<br>Korea's recent moves to apparently renew its activities at the
<br>Yongbyon nuclear complex, including its removal of International
<br>Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) seals on equipment, Pyongyang's
<br>threats are largely for show. As part of the Six-Party process,
<br>the regime has already taken significant steps toward nuclear
<br>disablement, xxxxx out, so North Korean leaders cannot
<br>
<br>Shanghai 00000422 002.2 of 003
<br>
<br>
<br>actually accomplish very much in the short term.
<br>
<br>Kim jong-il's health
<br>--------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Regarding Kim Jong-il's (KJI) purported ill health, xxxxx
<br>admit they have been unable to divine what has actually
<br>happened, noting such information is "top secret" even to North
<br>Koreans. xxxxx claims that KJI has a long history of recreational
<br>drug use that has resulted in frequent bouts of epilepsy and
<br>contributed to his poor health overall. xxxxx recalls
<br>hearing an unconfirmed report that, in the last several weeks, a
<br>team of five Chinese physicians traveled to Pyongyang, perhaps
<br>to tend to KJI. xxxxx cautions against reading too much into what
<br>he considers "pure speculation." Even if KJI suffered some
<br>medical emergency, illness "does not necessarily mean he is
<br>dying or has lost political control, or that regime collapse is
<br>somehow imminent."
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) At the present time, xxxxx considers it "likelier than not"
<br>KJI remains in charge and is making political decisions. xxxxx is
<br>less certain, quoting reports that long time consort and former
<br>secretary Kim Ok may be caring for Kim and overseeing policy on
<br>his behalf. KJI puts a lot of confidence in Kim Ok, notes xxxxx,
<br>recalling that she was a member of the North Korean delegation
<br>led by General Jo Myong-rok that visited the Clinton White House
<br>in October 2000.
<br>
<br>Contenders for future leadership
<br>--------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) There is consensus among xxxxx that, at least
<br>for the moment, none of KJI's three sons is likely to be tapped
<br>to succeed him. xxxxx considers the two youngest sons, Kim
<br>Jong-chol and Kim Jong-un, far too inexperienced and incapable
<br>of effective governance. xxxxx, observing that KJI's
<br>oldest son, Kim Jong-nam, is "too much of a playboy," Kim
<br>Jong-chol is "more interested in video games" than governing,
<br>and Kim Jong-un is simply too young. Additionally, KJI had been
<br>groomed for many years to replace his father and former North
<br>Korean leader Kim Il-Sung before the latter passed away. In
<br>contrast, xxxxx, none of the sons has received similar
<br>preparatory treatment.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) The most likely scenario for succession, xxxxx,
<br>is a group of North Korean military leaders, including civilians
<br>with close military connections, taking the helm from KJI. xxxxx
<br>also believes the military is probably best situated to run the
<br>country, at the present time. Still, if KJI remains in charge
<br>for another five or ten years, Beijing might then prefer to see
<br>Kim Jong-nam -- who is more of a known quantity than an ad hoc
<br>lineup of civil-military elements -- rise to power, xxxxx.
<br>
<br>¶10. (S)xxxxx that Kim Yong-nam (KYN) -- the president of
<br>North Korea's Supreme People's Assembly and second in command --
<br>seems the likeliest candidate to lead a new regime. In recent
<br>months, KYN has received foreign leaders and represented North
<br>Korea at many of the same events KJI would normally attend. xxxxx
<br>also reports that a younger brother of KYN's currently heads the
<br>Propaganda Department -- a position once held by KJI during his
<br>ascent to power -- while another relative runs North Korea's
<br>intelligence outfit. KYN is over 80 years old, xxxxx, so
<br>even a caretaker leadership role that fell to him would be short
<br>lived. xxxxx, it is interesting that KYN's family is
<br>seeded in the same "power positions" long considered important
<br>by the current ruling Kim family.
<br>
<br>Perils and promise of external exposure
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) xxxxx that North Korea is struggling to resolve the
<br>contradiction between its need for international engagement and
<br>desire to maintain ideological purity. Objectively speaking,
<br>exposure to the outside world -- its ways of thinking and
<br>quality of life -- is necessary to the regime's survival, xxxxx
<br>points out. From Pyongyang's perspective, someone who has seen
<br>the world as KJI's sons have might best be equipped to undertake
<br>reform in North Korea "on his own terms." At the same time, the
<br>regime has traditionally feared external influence, valued
<br>ideological purity, and prized ongoing closeness to the regime
<br>in its prospective cadres. As a result, xxxxx, those who
<br>
<br>Shanghai 00000422 003 of 003
<br>
<br>
<br>have traveled internationally are often marginalized within the
<br>insular North Korean leadership or ousted altogether. In this
<br>respect, xxxxx, the regime actually resembles China
<br>during its ideological heyday. It is "no coincidence" that Zhou
<br>Enlai and Deng Xiaoping, who both had overseas experience, were
<br>later the victims of purges at home, xxxxx.
<br>
<br>A glimpse beyond the yalu
<br>-------------------------
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) xxxxx extremely poor quality of the main road into Rajin, despite
<br>its role as the key route into that city, one of North Korea's
<br>special economic zones (SEZ) during the 1990s (the Rajin-Sonbong
<br>SEZ) that is also equipped with a harbor. xxxxx recalls watching a
<br>television news program commemorating a North Korean military
<br>holiday that coincided with his stay, and found it strange that
<br>only "still photo footage" aired of KJI reportedly visiting a
<br>military unit that day.
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) xxxxx not have the opportunity to engage ordinary
<br>North Korean citizens -- he spoke "only with his minders" -- but
<br>remembers observing many people walking on the streets, riding
<br>bicycles, and generally appearing healthy and happy. xxxxx
<br>recognizes that xxxxx took him only to a small corner of
<br>North Korea, he claims he saw "no signs of starvation" during
<br>this time. xxxxx skeptical of the World Food Program's
<br>(WFP) recent assessment that North Korea may soon be hit by a
<br>harsh famine, perhaps its worst since 1997. xxxxx,
<br>argues that whatever happens regarding the food situation, a
<br>famine will certainly not threaten the regime's political
<br>stability, asserting that North Koreans will sooner "die
<br>quietly" of starvation than defy Pyongyang.
<br>
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) Although difficult to verify xxxxx, our discussions suggest a variety of Chinese opinions
<br>regarding how best to approach the North Korean nuclear dilemma.
<br>Consensus on the subject continues xxxxx.
