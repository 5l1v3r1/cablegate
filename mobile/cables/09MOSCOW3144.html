<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: The prosecution in the Khodorkovskiy/Lebedev 
<br>trial has finished reading its 188 volumes of evidence, and 
<br>has moved on to questioning witnesses. An observer for the 
<br>International Bar Association stated his belief that the 
<br>trial is being conducted fairly. Related events outside of 
<br>Russia continue to affect the case. A deposition in a U.S. 
<br>court by Price Waterhouse Coopers (PWC) may show that PWC 
<br>received GOR pressure to disavow its prior Yukos audits; the 
<br>Russian Supreme Court upheld an ECHR ruling that Lebedev's 
<br>initial arrest was illegal; and an arbitration court in the 
<br>Hague found Russia to be bound by the Energy Charter Treaty, 
<br>leaving it open to a large judgment against it and possible 
<br>seizure of GOR assets abroad by Yukos shareholders. Despite 
<br>the case's wide implications, it continues to be a cause 
<br>celebre only for foreigners and a minority of Russians. The 
<br>case also shows the great lengths that the GOR is willing to 
<br>go in order to place a "rule of law" gloss on a politically 
<br>motivated trial. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>Recent developments 
<br>------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) The trial of former Yukos chief Mikhail Khodorkovskiy 
<br>and his associate Platon Lebedev continues in Moscow's 
<br>Khaminovsky court, having moved from the reading of the 
<br>prosecution's evidence -- which comprised 188 volumes and 
<br>lasted throughout the summer -- to questioning of the 
<br>prosecution's witnesses. Thus far the prosecution has called 
<br>31 of its 250 witnesses, meaning that the trial will probably 
<br>last until 2012.  XXXXXXXXXXXX told us December 23 that he believes the trial is being 
<br>conducted fairly and that Judge Danilkin has been doing 
<br>everything in his power to make sure that the defense gets a 
<br>fair opportunity to present arguments and challenge the 
<br>prosecution's evidence. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Among recent developments in the case, the defense has 
<br>been trying to introduce the testimony of a former Price 
<br>Waterhouse Coopers (PWC) auditor, who was deposed in 
<br>California in August by Khodorkovskiy lawyers. The 
<br>prosecution has objected to the introduction of the 
<br>deposition into the case, complaining that they had not 
<br>received sufficient notice; however, according to Teets, the 
<br>Russian Embassy did not inform the head investigator in 
<br>Russia until recently. The PWC deposition goes to the heart 
<br>of Yukos's guilt or innocence; as Yukos's auditor, it signed 
<br>off on Yukos's financial statements from 1994 to 2003, only 
<br>to disavow this prior approval in 2007. As  XXXXXXXXXXXX noted, if 
<br>the audits were properly withdrawn, this will be a "black 
<br>mark" for the defense; if not, it could help the defense, but 
<br>would greatly tarnish PWC's international reputation. Teets 
<br>said that the content of the deposition had not yet been made 
<br>public, but speculated that the auditor had testified that 
<br>PWC had been pressured by the Russian government into 
<br>withdrawing its prior certifications of Yukos books and 
<br>records. 
<br>
<br>Lebedev ruling and other "international" issues 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) The Yukos battle continues simultaneously both on 
<br>domestic and the international fronts, with some concrete 
<br>effects on the case's proceedings in Moscow. On December 23, 
<br>the Russian Supreme Court ruled that the 2003 decision to 
<br>arrest and detain Lebedev was illegal, in keeping with a 2007 
<br>ruling by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). (Note: 
<br>The GOR often loses cases at the ECHR, and its common 
<br>practice is to pay the compensation required by the ECHR's 
<br>rulings while ignoring the substantive redress of the 
<br>systemic problem involved. This decision represents a rare 
<br>departure from this practice and signals a potentially 
<br>encouraging trend. End Note.) The Supreme Court's ruling 
<br>indicated only that the first two months of Lebedev's six 
<br>years (to date) of incarceration were illegal, and thus might 
<br>be considered only marginally relevant. However, the defense 
<br>might use this ruling to argue that the entire conviction was 
<br>tainted by the illegal detention and therefore should be 
<br>thrown out. Defense lawyers told Radio Free Europe that they 
<br>have not yet decided how to proceed, but called the ruling a 
<br>"victory," while expressing bewilderment at the Supreme 
<br>Court's two-year delay in ruling on the case. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) On December 23, Moscow's Basmanny Court issued an 
<br>arrest warrant in absentia for former Yukos treasurer Andrey 
<br>Leonovich, which Khodorkovskiy's lawyers called a ploy to 
<br>
<br>pressure witnesses, and which will likely further exacerbate 
<br>tensions with the UK (where Leonovich now resides) over the 
<br>issue of extraditions. This move follows a December 2 ruling 
<br>by an international arbitration tribunal in the Hague that 
<br>Russia is bound by the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT), thus 
<br>requiring the GOR to defend itself against claims from Yukos 
<br>shareholders for an estimated 100 billion USD in damages (ref 
<br>A). This sum would be the largest arbitration award ever, 
<br>representing 10 percent of Russia's GDP, and although 
<br>collecting the entire amount would be difficult, it could 
<br>allow shareholders to seize state assets outside of Russia. 
<br>The ECT ruling could affect, among others, companies such as 
<br>Royal Dutch Shell and BP who were forced to renegotiate 
<br>contracts on terms favorable to the GOR. 
<br>
<br>Russians apathetic, but skeptical towards GOR 
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) Given such significant international implications to 
<br>the case, and given Khodorkovskiy's former stature, one might 
<br>expect a large amount of focus on the Yukos case inside 
<br>Russia. However, most Russians continue to pay scant 
<br>attention (ref B). According to a December poll by the 
<br>Levada Center encompassing 1,600 respondents in 127 cities 
<br>and villages, only a little more than one-third of Russians 
<br>are following the case (a May Levada poll showed the same 
<br>figure for people who were at all aware that the case 
<br>existed). The same poll, however, revealed a notable 
<br>divergence in public opinion from the "party line" maintained 
<br>by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. In his December 3 
<br>televised question and answer session with the public, Putin 
<br>defended the legitimacy of Khodorkovskiy's incarceration and 
<br>accused Khodorkovskiy of also being a murderer. He also 
<br>claimed that all of the earnings from the sale of Yukos were 
<br>being funneled into the country's Housing and Utilities Fund. 
<br>The Levada poll, however, showed that 65 percent of 
<br>respondents did not believe Putin's claim about the Housing 
<br>Fund, and 50 percent believed that Putin should be summoned 
<br>as a witness in the case. 
<br>
<br>Khodorkovskiy starting to lose hope 
<br>----------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev have consistently 
<br>maintained an upbeat demeanor, frequently smiling and 
<br>laughing during the proceedings, and chatting buoyantly with 
<br>supporters. Over the course of his imprisonment, 
<br>Khodorkovskiy has written a series of philosophical articles 
<br>(printed in liberal papers such as Vedomosti) that have 
<br>amounted to shadow policy papers of the type that he might 
<br>write if he were one of the President's advisors. He had 
<br>also expressed faith that the Russian court system would 
<br>exhibit sufficient fairness and rule of law, and Judge 
<br>Danilkin sufficient independence, to acquit him. In recent 
<br>months Khodorkovskiy has made pessimistic statements that he 
<br>does not expect ever to be freed. By all accounts, in 2003 
<br>Khodorkovskiy did not believe he would actually be arrested. 
<br>His thinking here seems to following a similar trajectory, 
<br>from naive refusal to believe what is happening, to the 
<br>gradual sinking in of the reality of his situation. 
<br>
<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) The fact that legal procedures are apparently being 
<br>meticulously followed in a case whose motivation is clearly 
<br>political may appear paradoxical. It shows the effort that 
<br>the GOR is willing to expend in order to save face, in this 
<br>case by applying a superficial rule-of-law gloss to a cynical 
<br>system where political enemies are eliminated with impunity. 
<br>It is not lost on either elite or mainstream Russians that 
<br>the GOR has applied a double standard to the illegal 
<br>activities of 1990s oligarchs; if it were otherwise, 
<br>virtually every other oligarch would be on trial alongside 
<br>Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev. There is a widespread 
<br>understanding that Khodorkovskiy violated the tacit rules of 
<br>the game: if you keep out of politics, you can line your 
<br>pockets as much as you desire. Most Russians believe the 
<br>Khodorkovskiy trial is politically motivated; they simply do 
<br>not care that it is. Human rights activists in general have 
<br>an uphill battle in overcoming public apathy and cynicism, 
<br>but nowhere more so than in the Khodorkovskiy case. We will 
<br>continue to monitor the case as it unfolds.
