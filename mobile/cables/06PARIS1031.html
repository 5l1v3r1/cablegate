<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Craig Stapleton for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: In a February 8 meeting with Ambassador, 
<br>Socialist Party (PS) presidential hopeful, current media 
<br>darling and president of the Poitou-Charentes region Segolene 
<br>Royal left no doubt as to her determination to win election 
<br>as president of France in 2007. She matter-of-factly 
<br>assessed her high poll numbers, expressing the conviction 
<br>that her focus on family, school, and social services issues, 
<br>along with her popularity among ordinary people, make her a 
<br>potent political force. (Current polls show that Royal could 
<br>make a formidable candidate in France's presidential 
<br>election, now 14 months away. These polls show she is one of 
<br>only two or three contenders that over half of voters now say 
<br>they could be willing to vote for as president.) Conceding 
<br>that "polls are not elections (ref D)" but adding that "they 
<br>stop being in error about six months before the elections," 
<br>Royal expressed optimism that her popularity would hold until 
<br>then -- and for six months thereafter, notwithstanding the 
<br>predictions of pundits to the contrary. Royal went to 
<br>considerable lengths to express her openness and friendliness 
<br>towards the U.S. and mentioned the possibility of visiting 
<br>Washington during an upcoming trip to New York to speak at 
<br>Columbia University. End summary. 
<br>
<br>A DISARMINGLY DIRECT PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) In her discussion with Ambassador Stapleton and 
<br>Embassy officers on February 8, Segolene Royal lived up to 
<br>her image as an uncommonly charismatic, subtle and determined 
<br>politician. She very matter-of-factly reviewed her 
<br>sustained, high poll numbers (ref C) and made no bones about 
<br>her intention to pursue the presidency so long as "other 
<br>people think it's possible for me." Unaffectedly applying to 
<br>herself the term "willful" often used about her by 
<br>detractors, Royal said she was determined to stay in the 
<br>presidential race until eliminated or victorious. (Comment: 
<br>According to a recent biography of Royal, she wanted to test 
<br>the waters by running in 2002, and rues having allowed 
<br>herself to be discouraged from doing so by fellow PS 
<br>heavyweights. In this biographer's account, she is 
<br>determined to stay in there to the end this time around. End 
<br>comment.) 
<br>
<br>"I'M THE ONE TO BEAT" FOR THE PS NOMINATION 
<br>------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Royal betrayed no qualms about her ability to shape 
<br>to her benefit the process that is leading to the PS's 
<br>selection of a candidate for 2007 by primary vote among party 
<br>members next November. In contrast to her public remarks 
<br>about securing the PS nomination, where she often quotes 
<br>former president Mitterrand in saying that, in politics "you 
<br>have to give time to time," Royal was much more direct with 
<br>the Ambassador, shrugging off the chances of her more senior 
<br>rivals in the PS by pointing out that, "I'm the one to beat." 
<br>(Note: Among PS party members, who will be the only voters 
<br>in next November's party primary, Royal's current popularity 
<br>ratings nearly double those of her nearest rival, former 
<br>prime minister Lionel Jospin. The popularity of Royal, as a 
<br>potential presidential standard bearer has risen steadily 
<br>among party members since last summer (ref F). Among the 
<br>public at large, she also far outpaces Jospin and other PS 
<br>heavyweights in current polls as the most preferred PS 
<br>presidential candidate. End Note.) 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Royal said that the attraction of winning -- with her 
<br>as the standard-bearer most clearly able to deliver victory 
<br>-- was a powerful galvanizer of opinion among party members. 
<br>She judged that her relatively junior standing as a party 
<br>leader and alleged lack of qualifications need not stand in 
<br>the way of her garnering enough support to win from among the 
<br>party's 130,000 card-carrying members. Briefly reviewing her 
<br>electoral and governmental record, she believed her 
<br>experience was more than adequate to overcome any qualms 
<br>party members (and thereafter, voters) might have about it. 
<br>(Note and comment: Royal has been elected to the National 
<br>Assembly four times; has served junior minister for the 
<br>environment, junior minister for elementary education and 
<br>junior minister for families, children and the handicapped. 
<br>Most recently (in 2004) she won the presidency of the 
<br>Poitou-Charentes region, beating the hand-picked candidate of 
<br>then Prime Minister Raffarin. Royal's is a distinguished 
<br>record of achievement and experience. What issue there may 
<br>be over her qualifications within the PS has to be seen in 
<br>light of, for example, former prime minister Laurent Fabius' 
<br>experience as prime minister, president of the National 
<br>Assembly, head of the PS party group in the National 
<br>Assembly, minister of economy and finance and regular 
<br>re-election to parliament since 1978. Since the February 8 
<br>meeting, it has become obvious that former prime minister 
<br>Jospin, in many ways the party's most senior figure, is 
<br>actively seeking the nomination (ref A). End Note and 
<br>comment.) 
<br>
<br>GOLD-PLATED IMAGE PLUS FAMILIES-SCHOOLS-NEIGHBORHOODS 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Royal outlined a carefully crafted strategy designed 
<br>to cast her as the candidate of safe change -- i.e., the 
<br>candidate who answers best French voters' simultaneous 
<br>eagerness for change and fear of it. Royal said that she 
<br>believed "people want a new kind of political discourse." 
<br>This conviction, she continued, was prompting her to skip the 
<br>political talk shows and deliberately focus instead on the 
<br>family, school and environmental issues that are her strength 
<br>and "are what matter most to ordinary people." She argued 
<br>that her focus on "soft" social services issues, coupled with 
<br>her very positive public image, her sterling center-left 
<br>credentials and proven effectiveness as a grass-roots 
<br>politician, make her a potent political force. Royal said 
<br>that the core of her candidacy is "having the courage to have 
<br>confidence in the voters." 
<br>
<br>NOT A LOT OF POLICY SPECIFICITY 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Royal spoke in very general, indeed, rather vague, 
<br>terms about what she stands for as a presidential candidate. 
<br>(Comment: Given her popularity, it is probably not in her 
<br>interest to furnish policy prescriptions at this time lest 
<br>she alienate potential supporters. End comment.) She 
<br>described a crisis of confidence among ordinary French people 
<br>who, she said, "are prey to a feeling of decline." She 
<br>evoked how prospects for those in the middle class are 
<br>shrinking, for their children even more so. She pointed to 
<br>narrowing the quality gap between France's elite schools and 
<br>its regular schools and universities as key to 
<br>re-invigorating upward mobility in French society. She also 
<br>criticized the Villepin government's emphasis on employment 
<br>as the engine of upward mobility, lamenting the 
<br>"destabilizing effects" for family life of the increased job 
<br>insecurity implicit in many of the government's employment 
<br>initiatives. Royal said that she would like "to lead a 
<br>national project" that would succeed by renewing "hope in the 
<br>people." Implicitly addressing criticism directed against 
<br>the absence of a program, Royal noted that the successful 
<br>record of the Jospin government didn't prevent him from 
<br>losing in his bid for the presidency in 2002, concluding that 
<br>"you don't win elections on your record or your program" but 
<br>rather on the expectations generated by a candidacy. 
<br>
<br>OPENNESS TO THE U.S. 
<br>-------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Though she did not dwell on foreign policy issues, 
<br>Royal did make an effort to convey openness towards the U.S. 
<br>Echoing the remarks of other political interlocutors across 
<br>the board, she duly noted her opposition to the U.S. invasion 
<br>of Iraq but went to considerable length in assuring the 
<br>Ambassador that a socialist government would "never have 
<br>actively campaigned against the U.S. in Africa," for example, 
<br>and would have handled differences in a more understanding 
<br>and less confrontational manner than President Chirac and 
<br>then-FM de Villepin. Royal recalled, with evident fondness, 
<br>her work organizing the 1981 Versailles Summit between 
<br>Presidents Reagan and Mitterrand. This was her first 
<br>experience with presidential-level diplomacy and apparently 
<br>involved liaising with the U.S. Secret Service; Royal 
<br>expressed her surprise, at the time, discovering the massive 
<br>logistical underpinnings required by such events. Royal also 
<br>made clear, through a reference to watching "Desperate 
<br>Housewives," that she did not reject American popular 
<br>culture. Royal did not augment her friendly sentiments 
<br>toward the U.S. with any vision for U.S.-France relations. 
<br>She did suggest a need "to find France's place in the world," 
<br>with the GoF showing less arrogance in how it speaks to the 
<br>world. The latter factor, she suggested, had played a role 
<br>in the defeat of France's 2012 Olympics candidacy. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (U) Royal said she would be visiting the U.S. soon, 
<br>probably in the context of accepting an invitation to speak 
<br>at Columbia University in New York this spring. She 
<br>mentioned the possibility of also visiting Washington at that 
<br>time. The Ambassador said he would be pleased to work with 
<br>her and her staff to design an appropriate program. 
<br>
<br>COMMENT 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶9. Royal clearly believes her determination, concern for 
<br>ordinary people and uncommon mix of strengths as a candidate 
<br>make her a real contender, notwithstanding the predictions of 
<br>pundits and her political rivals that the "Segolene 
<br>phenomenon" will not last. Opponents, whether from 
<br>center-right (with the exception of Interior Minister 
<br>Sarkozy) or her own center-left, either insist on her 
<br>"unfitness" for the job (ref D) or suggest she is a stalking 
<br>horse for a "draft" of former PM Jospin. Although it is not 
<br>unfair to be skeptical about Royal's staying power or even 
<br>her qualifications, it is also true that much of the 
<br>disparagement of her stems from envy of the popularity of a 
<br>female upstart, who is also challenging the unwritten rules 
<br>of the political establishment. It is also undeniable that 
<br>Royal has managed to tap into the feelings of an electorate 
<br>looking for change. 
<br>
<br>¶10. Royal appeared to be well disposed towards the U.S. 
<br>That said, as is the case for many on the left of the French 
<br>political spectrum, it would be a mistake to translate a high 
<br>comfort level with American culture into approval for a wide 
<br>range of U.S. polices, foreign and domestic. Royal has only 
<br>made brief trips to the U.S. as a tourist. End comment.
