<br> 
<br>Classified By: Political Minister-Counselor Kathy Allegrone, 
<br>Reasons 1.4(b),(d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (S/NF) SUMMARY AND BACKGROUND: French participants in the 
<br>second annual Franco-Israeli Strategic Dialogue on October 28 
<br>noted profound disquiet among the Israelis about Turkey, 
<br>according to Frederic Bereyziat, Senior MFA Desk Officer for 
<br>Israel and the Peace Process.  Bereyziat told poloff October 
<br>29 that the Israelis claimed the Turks have allowed 
<br>weapons-related material for Iran's nuclear program to 
<br>transit Turkey, with Prime Minister Erdogan's full knowledge. 
<br> In the lead up to this Strategic Dialogue, Bereyziat 
<br>reported, President Sarkozy called Prime Minister Netanyahu 
<br>directly on October 26, to urge him to establish an 
<br>independent investigation into the actions of the Israeli 
<br>Defense Forces in the Gaza conflict.  Sarkozy told Netanyahu 
<br>that such a step would decrease pressure on Israel and its 
<br>allies stemming from the Goldstone Report, but Netanyahu 
<br>responded briskly: "No way."  Franco-Israeli discussions on 
<br>the status of the peace process stumbled over a "profound 
<br>difference on tactics," according to Bereyziat, who also 
<br>reported the French intention to introduce a Resolution in 
<br>the U.N. General Assembly designed to prevent the Goldstone 
<br>Report from returning to the Security Council.  Finally, 
<br>Bereyziat described a division within the Israeli delegation 
<br>about Syria's openness to the west, with some on the 
<br>delegation discounting benefits that might accrue to Israel 
<br>through the re-launching of negotiations, and others 
<br>supporting the French claim that Israel would put Syria in a 
<br>bind by suddenly expressing openness to negotiations over the 
<br>Golan. 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (S/NF) BACKGROUND: As notetaker for the Strategic 
<br>Dialogue, Bereyziat was in a position to provide a 
<br>description of these discussions.  When serving as the 
<br>Transatlantic Diplomatic Fellow in the French MFA, poloff 
<br>often met and worked with Bereyziat.  He told poloff October 
<br>29 that the Strategic Dialogue may have been his last major 
<br>meeting for the MFA, as he is leaving the ministry for 
<br>personal reasons on November 10.  END SUMMARY AND BACKGROUND. 
<br> 
<br>SECOND ANNUAL FRANCO-ISRAELI STRATEGIC DIALOGUE 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -- 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C) Pierre Sellal, Director General of the French MFA, 
<br>and Yossi Gal, Director General of the Israeli MFA, led their 
<br>respective delegations in the second annual Franco-Israeli 
<br>Strategic Dialogue on October 29 in Paris.  The "five to six 
<br>hours" of talks covered a wide range of issues, including the 
<br>peace process, Turkey, Syria, and Iran, according to 
<br>Bereyziat.  The first bilateral Strategic Dialogue took place 
<br>in May 2008, approximately a year after President Sarkozy's 
<br>election.  No such exchanges took place under President 
<br>Chirac, Bereyziat acknowledged, adding that the French now 
<br>hope to make it an annual tradition.  He said the next 
<br>dialogue will take place late next year.  (COMMENT: This new 
<br>tradition reflects Sarkozy's avowed attempt to create a more 
<br>balanced French approach to the Middle East by developing a 
<br>closer rapport with Israel.  END COMMENT.) 
<br> 
<br>TURKEY 
<br>------ 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (S/NF) The French participants in the Strategic Dialogue 
<br>noted profound disquiet among the Israelis about Turkey, 
<br>Bereyziat said.  He reported that the Israelis claimed the 
<br>Turks have allowed weapons-related material for Iran's 
<br>nuclear program to transit Turkey, with Prime Minister 
<br>Erdogan's full knowledge.  The French replied that Israel 
<br>would need to have clear and concrete proof of such activity 
<br>before leveling accusations.  The Israelis replied that they 
<br>are collecting evidence which they will eventually publicize. 
<br> In the meantime, Bereyziat said, the Israelis explained that 
<br>they will not take strong public positions condemning what 
<br>they perceive as Turkey's recent strategic shift away from 
<br>western positions on the peace process, Iran, and Israel's 
<br>nuclear program.  Erdogan's public comments about Israel's 
<br>nuclear weapons had particularly irked the Israelis, 
<br>Bereyziat explained, describing them as unprecedented by a 
<br>Turkish leader.  Moreover, the Israelis blamed the Europeans, 
<br>and especially France, for this shift in Turkey's policy. 
<br>They said that if Europe had more warmly embraced Turkey, 
<br>then the Turks would not be taking steps to earn approval in 
<br> 
<br>the Arab and Muslim world at the expense of Israel.  The 
<br>French, in response to this accusation, "begged to differ," 
<br>Bereyziat said. 
<br> 
<br>GOLDSTONE REPORT, PEACE PROCESS, UAV TECHNOLOGY 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -- 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (C/NF) President Sarkozy called Prime Minister Netanyahu 
<br>directly on October 26, Bereyziat reported, to urge him to 
<br>establish an independent investigation into the actions of 
<br>the Israeli Defense Forces in Gaza.  Sarkozy informed 
<br>Netanyahu that such a step would decrease pressure on Israel 
<br>and its allies stemming from the Goldstone Report.  Netanyahu 
<br>responded briskly: "No way."  French officials emphasized 
<br>Sarkozy's point again during the Strategic Dialogue, 
<br>Bereyziat said, and the Israelis continued to reject his 
<br>advice.  (See reftel for a description of earlier French 
<br>efforts to persuade the Israelis to take this step.) 
<br>Separately, to prevent the Goldstone Report from further 
<br>impeding the peace process, the French are now contemplating 
<br>a pre-emptive approach in the U.N. General Assembly, 
<br>according to Bereyziat.  With this aim in mind, the GOF may 
<br>float a Resolution that would ensure the Goldstone Report 
<br>does not return to the Security Council.  Bereyziat did not 
<br>specify further what this draft Resolution might contain. 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (C/NF) Franco-Israeli discussions on the status of the 
<br>peace process itself resembled a "conversation of the deaf," 
<br>Bereyziat said.  "We have a profound disagreement on tactics, 
<br>but we obviously agree on the end goal."  France has not, 
<br>however, taken any "punitive" measures following the Gaza 
<br>conflict, Bereyziat explained.  He said that whereas other 
<br>European countries stopped selling Unmanned Aerial Vehicle 
<br>(UAV) parts to Israel after the conflict, the French have 
<br>continued to do so.  And Bereyziat reported that the French 
<br>and Israelis did agree on one important point related to the 
<br>peace process: Iran continues to play a destructive role in 
<br>the region, creating and prolonging conflicts. 
<br> 
<br>SYRIA 
<br>----- 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (S/NF) Bereyziat described a division within the Israeli 
<br>delegation about Syria's openness to the west.  Some on the 
<br>delegation perceived Syrians as intransigent and discounted 
<br>the possible benefits that might accrue to Israel through the 
<br>re-launching of direct, or even indirect, negotiations. 
<br>Others, Bereyziat said, including military representatives 
<br>"with Ehud Barak's ear," supported the French claim that 
<br>Israel would put Syria in a bind by suddenly expressing 
<br>openness to negotiations over the Golan.  This group of 
<br>Israelis believed Syrian leaders seek to free themselves from 
<br>dependence on Iran and to re-engage fully with the west.
