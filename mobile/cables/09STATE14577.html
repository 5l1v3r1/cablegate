<br>Classified By: NEA Acting A/S Jeffrey Feltman: Reasons 1.4 (b,d) 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (SBU) This is an action request for Posts in Abu Dhabi, 
<br>Amman, Cairo, Kuwait City, Manama, and Riyadh.  Please see 
<br>para 7. 
<br> 
<br>Summary and Background 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) Posts are requested to raise with appropriate 
<br>government officials our concerns about Russian plans to 
<br>transfer the S-300 long-range air-defense system to Iran. 
<br>Washington would like these governments to immediately and 
<br>directly raise this issue  with their Russian counterparts 
<br>arguing that such a transfer could significantly enhance 
<br>Iran's air defense capability; increase regional instability; 
<br>and reward Iran at a time when Iran is undermining security 
<br>with its nuclear pursuits and support for terrorism. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (S//NF) Over the past few years, the Russian Government 
<br>has told the USG that, while it has a contract to supply the 
<br>S-300 air-defense system to Iran, the transfer would not be 
<br>completed until Iran complied with its international nuclear 
<br>obligations.  USG suspicions were piqued during a February 12 
<br>meeting when Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov brushed off U/S 
<br>Burns concerns over such a transfer, but did not reiterate 
<br>Russia,s year-long position that the S-300 transfer depends 
<br>on Iranian behavior.  The Iranian Defense Minister is 
<br>currently in Moscow for talks with Russia on the delivery of 
<br>the S-300.  Initial press reports quote Rosoboronexport 
<br>officials as saying there has been no progress in the talks 
<br>to expedite delivery of the system.  Russian news media also 
<br>speculates that Russia will not deliver the S-300 to Iran for 
<br>fear of upsetting discussions with the new US administration. 
<br> Despite the denials in the press, we are concerned by the 
<br>technical preparations for delivery of the S-300, which are 
<br>complete or nearing completion.  It appears that there is a 
<br>need for action now to prevent a senior-level political 
<br>decision to allow the delivery to go foward. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) Though Russia states that the S-300 is "defensive" in 
<br>nature, the mobile system could be used to support offensive 
<br>operations.  S-300s located on Iranian territory would have 
<br>the range to engage targets well beyond Iran,s borders into 
<br>Persian Gulf and Iraqi airspace, threatening U.S. and 
<br>regional partners. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (SBU) UNSCR 1747, passed on March 24, 2007, urged all 
<br>states to exercise "vigilance and restraint in the supply, 
<br>sale or transfer" of a broad range of conventional weapons as 
<br>defined for the purpose of the United Nations Register on 
<br>Conventional Arms to Iran.  While the S-300 does not 
<br>technically meet the definition within the UN Register for 
<br>any of the categories of items listed in paragraph 6 of UNSCR 
<br>1747, transfers of this type of system to Iran seriously 
<br>undercut the primary objective of UNSCR 1747 to further press 
<br>Iran to comply with the UNSCR 1737 requirement to suspend its 
<br>proliferation sensitive nuclear activities and cooperate 
<br>fully with the IAEA. 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (C) We have selected action addressee posts to engage the 
<br>GOR because we maintain strong bilateral relationships and 
<br>share common security interests, but also because we believe 
<br>these governments have potential leverage with Russia.  In 
<br>particular,  Abu Dhabi, Kuwait, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia have 
<br>increased their political-military cooperation with Russia. 
<br>These countries can legitimately make the point to Moscow 
<br>that they cannot have a close political-military partnership 
<br>with Russia, while Russia strengthens the hand of Iran, 
<br>arguably the greatest threat to each of these nation's 
<br>security. 
<br> 
<br>Suggested Talking Points 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (SBU) Posts are requested to approach appropriate host 
<br>government officials regarding the possible transfer of the 
<br>S-300 air-defense system from Russia to Iran.   Post should 
<br>draw from the following talking points. 
<br> 
<br>--In the spirit of our bilateral cooperation, we request your 
<br>government,s support in urging Russia to not transfer a 
<br>highly sophisticated air defense system to Iran. 
<br> 
<br>--In 2005 Russia signed a contract to sell the modern 
<br>long-range S-300 air defense missile system to Iran. 
<br> 
<br>-- In 2006, after it was exposed that Iran was not in 
<br>compliance with its international nuclear obligations, Russia 
<br>assured us, it would not complete the transfer until Iran 
<br>changed course. 
<br> 
<br>--Despite these assurances, we are concerned that Russia is 
<br>in a position to deliver the S-300 to Iran as soon as a 
<br>political decision is taken. 
<br> 
<br>--Moreover, when we raised our concerns in recent 
<br>senior-level conversations with Russian officials, we were 
<br>not reassured by the Russian response. 
<br> 
<br>--We request that you use your influence with Russia to 
<br>sharpen their decision against a transfer at this time. 
<br> 
<br>--Though Russia has categorized the S-300 as defensive in 
<br>nature, it is a mobile system that can easily used to support 
<br>offensive operations. 
<br> 
<br>--The most modern variant of the S-300, high-performance 
<br>surface-to-air missile system would greatly improve Iran,s 
<br>ability to defend large regions of its airspace up to 200 km 
<br>beyond its borders. 
<br> 
<br>--With Iran in non-compliance of its international nuclear 
<br>obligations and continued meddling in regional affairs, this 
<br>is not the time for Russia to engage in arms sales with 
<br>Tehran. 
<br> 
<br>-- We are also concerned about the implications of the 
<br>transfer of an air defense system to Iran.  Such transfers 
<br>would undercut the broad objective of UNSCR 1747 to increase 
<br>pressure on Iran to suspend its proliferation sensitive 
<br>nuclear activities and cooperate fully with the IAEA by 
<br>denying arms transfers to Iran. 
<br> 
<br>--(If appropriate)  We believe you have particular leverage 
<br>given your expanded military cooperation with Russia.  You 
<br>can legitimately argue that Moscow cannot be true partners in 
<br>the political-military realm while simultaneously 
<br>strengthening Iran, which is arguably the greatest threat to 
<br>your nation,s security.
