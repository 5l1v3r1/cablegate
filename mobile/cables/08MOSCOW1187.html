<br>Summary
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Putin's actions since the March elections have
<br>heightened political uncertainty about the shape of the
<br>Medvedev-Putin tandem. Lacking hard information, everything
<br>from Putin's decision to head United Russia to administrative
<br>changes at the White House is seen by the chattering class
<br>through the prism of the "succession question" - Putin's
<br>dilemma of leaving office without losing influence. Within
<br>the commentariat, two general lines have emerged. The
<br>"hand-off scenario" sees Putin marshaling control to protect
<br>his successor as regent before handing off the torch. The
<br>second, "Putin triumphant," scenario predicts a power shift
<br>from the Kremlin to the White House. Between the two are
<br>many variations, each with expectations of some conflict
<br>between Medvedev and Putin. In any case, Putin's tactical
<br>wiles have expanded his political options but have also
<br>deepened uncertainty about his intentions. End summary.
<br>
<br>A Season of Elite Uncertainty
<br>-----------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Moscow is simmering with expectation about the coming
<br>transition as evidenced by the wide range of theories,
<br>speculation, and rumors (but no hard information) that our
<br>contacts are circulating. The center of the debate remains:
<br>how does a healthy, young, and popular politician like Putin
<br>retain influence after leaving the Kremlin in a system that
<br>accrues a preponderance of influence to the presidency (ref
<br>a). His decision to head, but not join, United Russia;
<br>warnings about the need to clean out that party; and the
<br>Kremlin's preference for secrecy about cadre changes have
<br>reinvigorated debate about the Medvedev-Putin tandem and
<br>deepened the uncertainty among the elite about the shape of
<br>things to come. Coupled with the natural nervousness about a
<br>change in administration (with reports that ministers and
<br>other top officials are afraid to travel out of concern of
<br>being "out of touch" during cadre selection), the tempo of
<br>rumor-mongering and speculation has increased exponentially.
<br>
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Despite their differences on a host of issues, our
<br>contacts all expected competition within the elite to
<br>increase. They predicted that struggles could affect the
<br>development of relations between Medvedev and Putin,
<br>notwithstanding what appears to be their shared values and
<br>close personal ties. Already, we have seen evidence that
<br>some within the elite are taking advantage of perceived
<br>weakness during the transition to pursue their agendas:
<br>Mikhail Fridman's moves against TNK-BP and Sergey Chemezov's
<br>accelerated campaign to draw more state assets into
<br>Rostekhnologiya.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Elite disquiet stems as well from fears about
<br>impending changes in government cadres at the central and
<br>regional level. xxxxx accentuated Putin's call to reform United
<br>Russia, predicting a personnel shake-up that mysteriously
<br>would "change everything" yet would not involve the emergence
<br>of new faces in the leadership ranks. He expressed concern
<br>that United Russia's "monopoly of the political process"
<br>could be broken by splits within the party, although he did
<br>not consider the new "clubs" within the party as posing a
<br>danger in that regard. xxxxx also told us that a shake-up
<br>of the regional elite was already under way, with the
<br>replacement of the Irkutsk governor and the "voluntary"
<br>resignation of the Starvopol governor. Others have likewise
<br>predicted changes in the cadre ranks, but envision Putin
<br>positioning Medvedev to clean house, be it to remove
<br>Yeltsin-era warhorses like Moscow Mayor Luzhkov or Tatarstan
<br>President Shaymiyev xxxxx or remove troublesome siloviki hetmen xxxxx.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) xxxxx argued that the
<br>general uncertainty among the political elite flows from
<br>Putin's own indecisiveness. Rather than following a
<br>pre-ordained strategy, xxxxx described Putin as following
<br>a path of tactical decision, from the selection of Medvedev
<br>as successor to the snap United Russia congress April 21-22
<br>where Putin agreed to take the helm. Moreover, xxxxx
<br>posits that because Putin has not ruled out a return to the
<br>Presidency, he faces the constraints of wanting to preserve
<br>the power of the presidency, even as he seeks insurance
<br>
<br>Moscow 00001187 002 of 003
<br>
<br>
<br>against the possibility that Medvedev could use that power
<br>against him. xxxxx agreed, speculating that Putin is seeking
<br>insurance against Medvedev in the coming months. Although
<br>xxxxx was largely dismissive of Medvedev, considering him
<br>less a politician than an inexperienced administrator, he
<br>still sees risk to Putin as he takes over as Premier - an
<br>institutionally weaker position, with responsibility for
<br>unpopular decisions.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) There are others, however, who describe Putin's
<br>decisions as creating the foundation for a transition to a
<br>more institution-based political system. An article in
<br>xxxxx argued that the creation of a second center of power in the
<br>White House mitigates the risk of another round of
<br>re-distributing property or a change in the general course
<br>for the country. xxxxx told
<br>us that Medvedev has no recourse but to tap public support
<br>for his putatively more liberal agenda, much as Mikhail
<br>Gorbachev did in his struggle with the more conservative
<br>elements of the then Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In
<br>the long run, xxxxx sees the potential for an evolution
<br>away from the inter-clan struggles to a public competition of
<br>ideas.
<br>
<br>The Party of Putin
<br>------------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Indicative of the uncertainty in Moscow, our
<br>interlocutors discussed a wide range of theories about
<br>Putin's decision to accept the United Russia leadership. As
<br>an advocate of the "Putin Triumphant" scenario,
<br>xxxxx saw Putin maneuvering the Duma, United
<br>Russia, and the regional elite to check the predominate
<br>influence that Medvedev will enjoy thanks to the
<br>constitution's bias in favor of the presidency. xxxxx
<br>explained his bid to head United Russia as a means to balance
<br>Medvedev's authority to appoint governors, by giving Putin
<br>control over the regional legislatures, whose approval is
<br>required before a gubernatorial candidate can take office.
<br>Moreover, xxxxx argued that by heading United Russia, Putin
<br>will be able to dominate the Duma and Federation Council and
<br>thus control the passage of legislation.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) xxxxx also saw Putin's leadership of the
<br>party as providing the basis for constraining Medvedev's
<br>ability to remove him from the premiership. xxxxx alleged that
<br>PA Head Sergey Sobyanin was working on legislation that would
<br>constrain the President's ability to dismiss the Premier,
<br>although she offered no information about how this could be
<br>done without altering the constitution, which Putin has
<br>repeatedly stated he will not do. In their xxxxx envisioned a similar motive, but a different
<br>tactic in Putin's decision. By controlling the majority
<br>party in the Duma, Putin insures that any move to remove him
<br>from the Premiership results in a political crisis. (The
<br>United Russia-controlled Duma could exercise its
<br>constitutional prerogative and refuse to approve Medvedev's
<br>choice for a replacement premier, leading to new elections
<br>and potential stalemate.)
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Not all of our contacts shared the view that Putin's
<br>recent moves represented a shifting of the balance of
<br>influence. xxxxx dismissed Putin's move to head United
<br>Russia as sign of his desperation, vice a strong tactical
<br>move to check Medvedev. xxxxx characterized United Russia as
<br>an amalgamation of careerists and bureaucrats, which is loyal
<br>to whoever holds power. Comments by xxxxx that United
<br>Russia is guided by self-interest, without any common values,
<br>appear to support xxxxx assertions. xxxxx called Putin's
<br>decision to take the party lead a mistake, seeing the
<br>processes underway now, including the sensational article
<br>about his marriage plans to gymnast-turned-Duma deputy Alina
<br>Kabayeva, as part of the inevitable "de-mystification" of the
<br>soon to be former president.
<br>
<br>A New Kind of Premiership
<br>-------------------------
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Against the backdrop of Putin's decision to head
<br>United Russia, news about the government structural and
<br>personnel changes have heightened speculation about a
<br>metamorphosis of the Premiership. Press reports last week
<br>told of a new paradigm in which virtually all responsibility
<br>outside of defense, security, and the protection of societal
<br>order that lay with the government (and ultimately the
<br>Premier) would be pushed down to the ministries. Initial
<br>reactions interpreted this as shaping a new order in the
<br>government, in which the Premier sets the "strategic"
<br>
<br>Moscow 00001187 003 of 003
<br>
<br>
<br>direction and holds the expected new stratum of technocratic
<br>Deputy Premiers to account for the actions of the ministries.
<br>As such, proponents of this view argued that Putin is hoping
<br>that he can stand above the fray, blaming his subordinate
<br>"scapegoats" for any potential government failings or
<br>missteps. Others, however, see this less as a result of
<br>grand politics and more of a sensible re-alignment of duties
<br>- "housecleaning" before Putin takes office.
<br>
<br>¶11. (SBU) There has also been considerable speculation about
<br>a reworking of the relationships between the President, the
<br>Premier, and the governors. The Kremlin and Minister for
<br>Regional Development Kozak took quick action to squash rumors
<br>floated in the business newspaper Vedemosti early this month
<br>that control over the regional plenipotentiaries (polpreds)
<br>would shift to the government, although Kozak but did not
<br>rule out future changes in the role and jurisdiction of the
<br>polpreds. xxxxx noted that changing the polpreds may not
<br>be necessary, since the government has responsibility for
<br>assessing the "effectiveness" of regional leaders and thus
<br>could shape the president's approach to gubernatorial
<br>appointments.
<br>
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) The "succession question" continues to dominate the
<br>Russian political scene, despite the remarkable changes that
<br>have taken place over the past six months. Putin has proven
<br>his ability to reshape the landscape and create his own
<br>opportunities by accepting the Premiership under Medvedev as
<br>well as the mantle of "party leader" for United Russia,
<br>creating what some see as a potential alternative power
<br>center in the White House. Nevertheless, his success in
<br>spinning out alternatives for himself has served to prolong
<br>the agony of the "succession question" and fostered
<br>uncertainty among the elite. Uncertainty multiplies the risk
<br>of conflict between the elite clans over influence. Putin's
<br>problem can be seen as a Hobbesian security dilemma - the
<br>greater his personal security, the less security there is for
<br>the other players, including his chosen successor Medvedev.
