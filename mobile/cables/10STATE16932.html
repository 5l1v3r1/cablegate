<br>FIBER FROM A COMPANY IN CHINA 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: (U)  CLASSIFIED BY EAP DAS DAVID SHEAR, 
<br>REASON: 1.4 (C). 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (U) This is an action request.  Embassy Beijing, please 
<br>see paragraph 3. 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (S) Background/Objective: The United States has 
<br>information that in December 2009, an Iranian company was 
<br>seeking to procure five tons of carbon fiber from Yoon 
<br>Networks Shanghai Company.  We understand this company is 
<br>likely seeking this material on behalf of the Shahid Bakeri 
<br>Industries Group (SBIG), which is responsible for Iran's 
<br>solid propellant ballistic missile program and an entity 
<br>designated under United Nations Security Council Resolution 
<br>(UNSCR) 1737.  The fiber being sought by the Iranian company 
<br>may be controlled by the Wassenaar Arrangement and Nuclear 
<br>Suppliers Group and could be used to produce rocket nozzles 
<br>or motor cases for Iran's solid propellant ballistic missile 
<br>systems.  We want to share this information with Chinese 
<br>officials and request that they take measures to prevent this 
<br>material from being transferred from China to Iran's missile 
<br>program.  We also want to note that we believe taking such 
<br>action would be consistent with UNSCR 1737. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (S) Action Request: Request Embassy Beijing approach 
<br>appropriate host government officials to deliver talking 
<br>points/non-paper in paragraph 4 below and report response. 
<br>Talking points also may be provided as a non-paper. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (S) Begin talking points/non-paper: 
<br> 
<br>(SECRET//REL CHINA) 
<br> 
<br>--We would like to alert you to information of proliferation 
<br>concern and request your assistance in investigating this 
<br>activity. 
<br> 
<br>--The United States has information that in December 2009, an 
<br>Iranian company was seeking to procure five tons of carbon 
<br>fiber from Yoon Networks Shanghai Company, a China-based firm 
<br>operated by a South Korean individual. 
<br> 
<br>--We understand this company is likely seeking this material 
<br>on behalf of the Shahid Bakeri Industries Group (SBIG), which 
<br>is responsible for Iran's solid propellant ballistic missile 
<br>program and an entity designated under United Nations 
<br>Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1737. 
<br> 
<br>--The fiber being sought by the Iranian company may be 
<br>controlled by the Wassenaar Arrangement and Nuclear Suppliers 
<br>Group and could be used by Iran to produce rocket nozzles for 
<br>its solid propellant medium-range and short-range ballistic 
<br>missile systems.  It also could be used by SBIG to produce 
<br>lighter motor cases that could potentially extend the range 
<br>of these systems. 
<br> 
<br>--We believe that the transfer of this material to SBIG poses 
<br>a significant missile proliferation risk and is inconsistent 
<br>with UNSCR 1737. 
<br> 
<br>--We therefore urge you to investigate this activity and take 
<br>measures to prevent this material from being transferred from 
<br>China to Iran's missile program. 
<br> 
<br>--We look forward to continued cooperation on missile 
<br>nonproliferation issues and to hearing of any actions your 
<br>government takes in response to this information. 
<br> 
<br>End talking points/non-paper 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (U) Washington POC is ISN/MTR James Mayes (Phone: 
<br>202-647-3185).  Please slug any reporting on this issue for 
<br>ISN/MTR and EAP/CM. 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (U) A word version of this document will be posted at 
<br>www.state.sgov.gov/demarche.
