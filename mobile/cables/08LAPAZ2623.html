<br>Classified By: PAS Couselor Denise Urs for reasons 1.4 b,d
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Bolivian President Evo Morales continues on
<br>the offensive against the media, part of a long-running
<br>campaign against the Bolivian media. Through verbal and
<br>financial assaults, the Bolivian Government is attempting to
<br>manipulate the way news is reported in this country. The GOB
<br>uses financial tactics, such as hitting media with tax bills
<br>or spending large sums of money on advertising, to influence
<br>editorial lines and to create a fog about truthfulness. It
<br>is also using its own media to expand and reinforce a cult
<br>following around Morales. End summary.
<br>
<br>GOB on the Attack
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) The latest round of political attacks against the
<br>media (reftel) is part of an ongoing battle. President Evo
<br>Morales regularly calls the media his "principal opposition,"
<br>and his "enemies." Notwithstanding his latest barbs,
<br>however, Morales usually adds that he is not against
<br>journalists, but against media owners. Rumors have been
<br>floating for months that in order to attempt to protect the
<br>President from his "enemies," Venezuelan investors are trying
<br>to purchase various outlets including La Paz's second-largest
<br>daily La Prensa, but so far there is no evidence that any
<br>sales have been concluded.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Instead, the GOB is intimidating media outlets
<br>through legal proceedings and showing favoritism in the
<br>distribution of its significant ad budget to push the press
<br>toward a more favorable view of its policies. In one
<br>example, the GOB sent La Razon, the largest newspaper in La
<br>Paz, a tax bill for nearly $5 million for having "avoided
<br>taxes during 2006." High-level officials at La Razon
<br>speculated to Public Affairs Section officers that this tax
<br>bill may have been an attempt to intimidate the paper to move
<br>from its generally anti-GOB editorial stance. The tax
<br>liability would also lower the value of the paper so that it
<br>could be sold at a lower price.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Nationalization of certain companies has also helped
<br>the GOB push its press agenda forward. On May 1, President
<br>Morales nationalized communications giant Entel, one of the
<br>largest advertisers in Bolivia. The GOB has been accused of
<br>using the enormous advertising budgets of the companies it
<br>has nationalized, including Entel, to reward media that
<br>publish pro-GOB articles and to punish those that do not.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) With only one exception, anti-GOB television network
<br>Unitel, all of the major media in Bolivia accept direct paid
<br>advertising from the Government, including spots that label
<br>the media as "liars" and suggest that Bolivians should not
<br>trust what they read, see, or hear from the press.
<br>Ironically, these same media often editorialize against the
<br>GOB during the same broadcasts or in the same newspapers that
<br>carry anti-media ads. PAS officers have asked media
<br>directors why they continue to carry the GOB ads, and all
<br>have stated that without the income it would be more
<br>difficult to survive in the very competitive market.
<br>
<br>Who owns the Media?
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) Although the majority of media in Bolivia are
<br>privately owned, it is difficult to determine who the owners
<br>are. There are no public records that prove ownership, and
<br>companies or individuals who own majority stakes can sell
<br>without a public paper trail. There are regular rumors about
<br>the possible sale of outlets, but proof of such sales is nil
<br>and the rumors usually fade quickly.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Another issue of concern is the influence of
<br>Venezuelan money in the media. PAS regularly hears that
<br>Venezuelan businessmen are negotiating the purchase of one of
<br>the television networks (usually cash-strapped ATB) as well
<br>as numerous newspapers that are in financial trouble. Others
<br>claim it is mere speculation. Nevertheless, Venezuelan money
<br>has built a technically stronger, pro-government, populist
<br>media network in the main Bolivian cities, called Radio y
<br>Television Popular.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) La Paz,s second largest daily La Prensa reported
<br>that Morales has reformed state-owned media outlets in an
<br>effort to expand the popularity and cult following of the
<br>President. The GOB created a network of community radio
<br>stations, an internet wire agency (ABI), and expanded the
<br>reach of the Government-owned TV Channel 7 using a $9 million
<br>donation from Venezuela to install 120 repeaters. There are
<br>also reports that the budget for Channel 7 operations has
<br>expanded by $3.8 million and that the normal procurement
<br>protocols have been dropped. The political opposition claims
<br>that the President is advised by a team of communications
<br>experts from Venezuela as well as other countries.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Under the Morales administration, Channel 7, Empresa
<br>Nacional de Television, has become one of the government's
<br>primary media tools, often presenting biased and misleading
<br>information, openly propagandizing for the President and his
<br>policies, and discrediting the opposition. Channel 7 is
<br>intent on expanding its reach and influence throughout the
<br>country. The manager of Channel 7 announced that it is
<br>upgrading to digital technology, a costly investment by
<br>Bolivian standards. A year ago, Channel 7 announced the
<br>receipt of a donation of equipment from unknown sources to
<br>improve its reach in the departments of La Paz and Santa
<br>Cruz, and that it had purchased 50 new repeaters to be
<br>distributed to remote locations in the west and the Amazon
<br>region. After the Iranian President's visit to Bolivia early
<br>in 2007, some publications reported that Channel 7 would get
<br>a large donation (some reported the intended donation would
<br>be a multi-million dollar investment) to strengthen the state
<br>TV network, but there has been no indication that this is
<br>going to materialize. Iranian media are now reporting that
<br>the donation will be in the form of Spanish-language
<br>programming. Channel 7 also airs Venezuelan Government-owned
<br>Telesur programming as part of its regular daily schedule.
<br>
<br>Who Owns the Print Media?
<br>
<br>¶10. (SBU) Two major media conglomerates appear to own most
<br>of the media in Bolivia. Spanish group Prisa (owners of the
<br>Spanish daily El Diario) owns La Razon; ATB, a private TV
<br>network; and &Extra8 a cheap sensationalist daily. The
<br>other media conglomerate, the Canelas and Rivero families,
<br>owns most of the national major dailies throughout the
<br>country. In La Paz, they own La Prensa; in Santa Cruz,
<br>leading daily El Deber; in Cochabamba leading daily Los
<br>Tiempos; they also own the only daily in El Alto, El Alteo;
<br>in Sucre, Correo del Sur; in Potosi, El Potosi; and in
<br>Tarija, El Nuevo Sur. The Canelas-Rivero Group papers are
<br>generally critical of the Government. Other smaller,
<br>independently owned newspapers fight for ever-shrinking
<br>private-sector advertising revenues and often accept GOB
<br>advertising to continue printing.
<br>
<br>Comment
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Bolivia's media environment is increasingly
<br>difficult. The GOB, aided by large Venezuelan investments,
<br>has used financial pressures in an attempt to change the
<br>editorial line of the media, and to hasten or provoke the
<br>sale of media outlets. The regular rumors about the
<br>impending sales of media may be a smoke screen to cover an
<br>actual sale, they may be a rouse to frighten the media, or
<br>they may simply be the imagination of media owners. It is
<br>always possible, however, that media will be sold without
<br>public knowledge, changing the opinion-leader landscape in
<br>the country. End comment.
