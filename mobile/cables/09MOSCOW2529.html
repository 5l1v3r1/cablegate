<br>SUBJECT: ASD/ISA VERSHBOW'S SEPTEMBER 30 VISIT TO MOSCOW: 
<br>BILATERAL COOPERATION, IRAN, AFGHANISTAN, MISSILE DEFENSE, 
<br>MILITARY/DEFENSE COOPERATION 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Susan Elliott for 
<br>reasons 1.4 (b), (d) 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (C) SUMMARY:  During consultations with GOR officials on 
<br>September 30, Assistant Secretary of Defense (ASD) for 
<br>International Security Affairs Alexander Vershbow discussed 
<br>ways to implement bilateral cooperation in a number of key 
<br>areas of mutual interest.  Both sides praised progress since 
<br>the "reset" in U.S.-Russian relations during the first 
<br>Obama-Medvedev meetings, though both agreed that concrete 
<br>actions are necessary to realize true cooperation.  ASD 
<br>Vershbow emphasized that the reset needs to be reciprocal and 
<br>noted that Iran would be a critical test case.  Both sides 
<br>expressed interest in further cooperation on Afghanistan, 
<br>especially in the sphere of counternarcotics.  While the 
<br>Administration's missile defense announcement has met with a 
<br>generally positive reaction in the Russian media, Duma and 
<br>Security Council representatives made clear they had 
<br>questions about the later phases of the new U.S. plan and 
<br>questioned whether the U.S. would be prepared for cooperation 
<br>going beyond information exchange.   Russian interlocutors 
<br>acknowledged the dangers posed by Iran's nuclear program, but 
<br>stressed Moscow's skepticism about sanctions.  Throughout the 
<br>meetings, ASD Vershbow emphasized that Russia's efforts to 
<br>assert a regional sphere of influence posed a threat to the 
<br>reset in bilateral relations, and reiterated the U.S. 
<br>commitment to the sovereignty, independence, and territorial 
<br>integrity of Georgia, Ukraine and other partners in the 
<br>region.  END SUMMARY. 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (C) OVERVIEW OF MEETINGS:  ASD Vershbow met with the 
<br>following GOR officials:  Viktor Mikhaylovich Zavarzin 
<br>(Defense Committee Chairman of the State Duma), Aleksandr A. 
<br>Gorbunov (Chief of the Main Directorate for International 
<br>Military Cooperation of the Ministry of Defense), General 
<br>Yuriy Nikolayevich Baluyevskiy (Deputy Secretary of the 
<br>Security Council and former Chief of Defense), Aleksey 
<br>Nikolayevich Borodavkin (Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs), 
<br>and Grigoriy Borisovich Karasin (First Deputy Minister of 
<br>Foreign Affairs and State Secretary).  He also met informally 
<br>with academic experts and pundits and gave an interview to 
<br>Interfax. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- --- 
<br>U.S.-RUSSIAN COOPERATION -- WORDS ARE NOT ENOUGH 
<br>--------------------------------------------- --- 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C) At all meetings, ASD Vershbow and his Russian 
<br>interlocutors noted that U.S.-Russia relations since the 
<br>"reset" have been moving in the right direction, with 
<br>opportunities for increased bilateral cooperation in areas of 
<br>mutual interest.  The Bilateral Presidential Commission and 
<br>associated working groups will be useful to inject momentum 
<br>into our work.  However, ASD Vershbow stressed that words 
<br>alone or mere information exchanges are not enough, and the 
<br>reset must be reciprocal.  Both sides need to take action to 
<br>implement agreements already concluded and to pave the way 
<br>for additional areas of work and to identify concrete 
<br>projects for cooperation.  Mechanisms for enabling these 
<br>efforts need to be established (e.g., the Ministry of Defense 
<br>is currently undergoing a major organizational reform, which 
<br>has hampered efforts for implementing the previously approved 
<br>2009 military-to-military work plan, and both sides need to 
<br>ensure that planned events are conducted). 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (C) ASD Vershbow agreed that next steps must be taken in 
<br>other areas where we have agreed to cooperate previously 
<br>(e.g., implementing a ballistic missile joint threat 
<br>assessment, a Joint Data Exchange Center, and the lethal 
<br>transit overflight in support of efforts in Afghanistan that 
<br>was agreed to at the July summit).  The U.S. and Russia must 
<br>be united in addressing common threats, such as the nuclear 
<br>and ballistic missile programs of Iran and North Korea. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (C) During his meeting with MOD International Military 
<br>Cooperation Chief Gorbunov, ASD Vershbow emphasized that 
<br>transparency should be a major aspect of cooperation. 
<br>Vershbow observed that DoD has been very open with the 
<br>Russians about sensitive issues.  For example, DoD has shared 
<br>information about efforts to help prepare Georgian troops for 
<br>deployment to Afghanistan in support of ISAF efforts; 
<br>however, the Russians have not reciprocated in this vein 
<br>(e.g., their Zapad 2009 and Ladoga exercises). 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (C) Both Duma Defense Committee Chair Zavarzin and 
<br>Security Council Deputy Secretary Baluyevskiy stressed that 
<br>they are ready to work on all areas of mutual interest on the 
<br>BILATERAL COOPERATION, IRAN, AFGHANISTAN, MISSILE DEFENSE, 
<br>MILITARY/DEFENSE COOPERATION 
<br> 
<br>condition that Russia's voice be heard.  In particular, 
<br>Zavarzin cited the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council 
<br>(1997-2002) in which Russia claims its views were ignored, 
<br>the NATO-Russia Council (the PJC's successor) in which Russia 
<br>"still did not have a full say," and Russia's interest in 
<br>working on anti-missile defense since 2000 which "did not pan 
<br>out."  ASD Vershbow acknowledged that both NATO and Russia 
<br>bore responsibility for areas where cooperation was not 
<br>successful, but suggested that we need to look ahead rather 
<br>than debate the past. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
<br>RUSSIAN DEFENSE MINISTRY REFORM POSES CHALLENGES TO 
<br>MIL-TO-MIL COOPERATION 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (C) The Russian Ministry of Defense (MOD) is in the midst 
<br>of major reform.  International Military Cooperation Chief 
<br>Gorbunov described the main goal of the reform as the 
<br>creation of the "most effective military force in the world," 
<br>despite existing limitations (e.g., demographics, large 
<br>landmass and borders, resources, and various threats along 
<br>the borders).  He identified two distinct processes as part 
<br>of the reform -- building of the armed forces and control of 
<br>the forces.  Today, Russia is focusing on building the 
<br>forces, including a large influx of civilian personnel in 
<br>management and specialist roles, improving pay/benefits of 
<br>service members, improving quality of equipment, and trying 
<br>to change decision-making processes at all levels.  Gorbunov 
<br>emphasized that these changes are intended to make Russia a 
<br>strong competitor, but also a reliable partner. 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (C) Gorbunov explained that the reform process is having 
<br>a significant impact on the Main Directorate for 
<br>International Military Cooperation (GUMVS) at the MOD.  The 
<br>Foreign Liaison Directorate (UVS) is being closed on October 
<br>1, and a new International Liaison Directorate is being 
<br>created.  Because of these changes, correspondence will be 
<br>slow over the next six weeks or so, which will impact the 
<br>Attache Corps in Moscow.  Gorbunov offered his personal 
<br>assistance during this period. 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (C) ASD Vershbow raised the Bilateral Defense 
<br>Consultations (BDC) which the U.S. had proposed for November, 
<br>and suggested the possibility of a broader dialogue between 
<br>the MOD and DoD on policy and strategy issues to complement 
<br>State-MFA exchanges.  Vershbow explained that DoD's proposed 
<br>BDC topics (including confidence-building measures and 
<br>transparency, risk reduction and notification procedures, 
<br>expanded military technical cooperation, etc.) were carefully 
<br>considered, but we welcomed Russia's suggestions for 
<br>additional topics.   Gorbunov responded that the MoD agrees 
<br>with the general notion of the BDC, but stipulated that the 
<br>General Staff needs to identify the right experts to address 
<br>topics to be discussed, and they plan to propose other topics 
<br>for consideration.  He gave no indication as to when a 
<br>response would be provided. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
<br> 
<br>AFGHANISTAN:  NARCO-TRAFFICKING, TERRORISM, ILLICIT FINANCE 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (C) ASD Vershbow's meetings with Deputy Foreign Minister 
<br>Borodavkin and MOD International Cooperation Chief Gorbunov 
<br>particularly focused on Afghanistan.  Borodavkin mentioned 
<br>that Russia views Afghanistan not only as a threat, but as an 
<br>opportunity for cooperation with the U.S. and other countries 
<br>(e.g., NATO), and suggested that ISAF could play an important 
<br>role in fighting illegal drug trafficking.  He recalled that 
<br>the U.S. and NATO had participated in the March 2009 
<br>conference held in Moscow at which counternarcotics was a top 
<br>priority. 
<br> 
<br>¶11.  (C) When asked by Borodavkin about whether more U.S. 
<br>troops will be sent to Afghanistan, ASD Vershbow explained 
<br>that General McChrystal's assessment is being reviewed at the 
<br>highest levels.  He noted that while the situation in 
<br>Afghanistan has not gone as well as hoped over the past six 
<br>months, the U.S. cannot allow the Taliban to regain control. 
<br>Expansion and training of the Afghan National Security Forces 
<br>(ANSF), improving governance, and economic assistance are all 
<br>still essential components of the U.S. strategy in 
<br>Afghanistan and we will continue to seek cooperation in these 
<br>areas. 
<br> 
<br>¶12.  (C) Borodavkin introduced a number of proposals for 
<br>increased Russian contribution.  He said that Russia would 
<br>like to launch cooperation with the U.S. on the economic 
<br>rehabilitation of Afghanistan and referred to a clause in the 
<br>July Summit Joint Statement that without economic 
<br>improvement, terrorism and other threats cannot be 
<br>eliminated.  Borodavkin suggested tripartite cooperation 
<br>(Russia-U.S.-Afghanistan) to reconstruct the Soviet-era 
<br>Salang Tunnel to provide a much needed reliable 
<br>transportation route.  The Russians have already undertaken a 
<br>technical study on this project and Borodavkin said that with 
<br>adequate resources, it would be a useful cooperative effort. 
<br>(Note:  Borodavkin's staff confirmed that the MFA has 
<br>submitted a proposal to the State Department on the Salang 
<br>Tunnel.) 
<br> 
<br>¶13.  (C) Russia considers narco-trafficking to be its highest 
<br>priority vis-a-vis Afghanistan.  Borodavkin said Russia is 
<br>ready to help the Afghan National Police (ANP) and Interior 
<br>Ministry in these efforts.  He noted that Russia is already 
<br>providing counternarcotics training to the Afghans at the 
<br>Domodedovo Center, and mentioned Russian counter-narcotics 
<br>chief Ivanov's statement that he is ready to provide 
<br>increased assistance on bilateral and multilateral levels 
<br>such as NATO and the OSCE.   Both Borodovkin and Vershbow 
<br>agreed that while the U.S. and Russia are currently working 
<br>together on this and the related issue of threat financing 
<br>through the Bilateral Presidential Commission, we need to 
<br>address these problems more forcefully.  Illicit financing 
<br>has been raised at Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) 
<br>and OSCE meetings, offering one area of possible cooperation. 
<br> 
<br>¶14.  (C) At his meetings at the MOD and MFA, ASD Vershbow 
<br>expressed appreciation for Russia's expression of interest in 
<br>providing weapons and equipment to the ANSF, and requested 
<br>that any such help be made in the form of donations with no 
<br>fees attached, as those charges would have to be paid for by 
<br>the U.S.  He underscored that some of the equipment/weapon 
<br>donation requests provided to Russia are intended to support 
<br>counter-narcotics efforts, so the U.S. hopes Russia will be 
<br>able to provide this support.  ASD Vershbow also asked that 
<br>Russia work with the Combined Security Transition Command - 
<br>Afghanistan (CSTC-A) to ensure that ANSF priority 
<br>requirements are met and provided a list of requirements. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶15.  (C) Borodavkin said that Russia will be able to supply 
<br>limited numbers of weapons to the ANP as aid and will 
<br>consider selling more weapons to the ANP and the Afghan 
<br>National Army (ANA).  He also expressed concern that there 
<br>are unlicensed (counterfeit) Russian weapons on the market, 
<br>which are of inferior quality.  Gorbunov explained that 
<br>donating equipment and weapons to Afghanistan is a 
<br>presidential decision, which would entail President Medvedev 
<br>asking the military services to donate items from current 
<br>stocks. 
<br> 
<br>¶16.  (C) Borodavkin also asked ASD Vershbow's perspectives on 
<br>the European proposal for a conference on Afghanistan after 
<br>the new Afghan government is established.  ASD Vershbow said 
<br>the U.S. saw merit in this idea as a means of seeking 
<br>additional international support for Afghanistan, but noted 
<br>that the timing of the initiative will depend on 
<br>Afghanistan's domestic politics; given the problems with the 
<br>Presidential elections, conditions were not yet right. 
<br> 
<br>¶17.  (C) Borodavkin mentioned the work of the Afghanistan 
<br>sub-working group under the Bilateral Presidential Commission 
<br>and stated that the Foreign Ministry is hoping that Amb. 
<br>Holbrooke can reschedule his planned visit to Moscow. 
<br>Borodavkin requested that ASD Vershbow pass on the invitation 
<br>to Amb. Holbrooke. 
<br> 
<br>¶18.  (C) ASD Vershbow also raised the lethal transit 
<br>agreement signed at the July summit in his meetings with 
<br>Gorbunov, Borodavkin, and Zavarzin.  He underscored the 
<br>importance of a timely Duma decision now that the General 
<br>Authorization has been delivered.  ASD Vershbow expressed 
<br>hopes that the inaugural flight of the agreement could take 
<br>place prior to Secretary of State Clinton's visit to Moscow 
<br>on October 12-14.  Zavarzin thought the Duma would approve 
<br>the agreement without any problem; Borodavkin confirmed that 
<br>the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is working on the request, 
<br>but warned that they do not have the sole voice on this 
<br>matter. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br>MISSILE DEFENSE DECISION:  NEITHER CONCESSION 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>NOR THREAT TO RUSSIA 
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶19.  (C) ASD Vershbow discussed the recent U.S. missile 
<br>defense decision during each of his consultations.  In his 
<br>meeting with Duma Defense Committee Chairman Zavarzin, ASD 
<br>Vershbow observed that the Russian press may have been overly 
<br>positive in its assessment of the September 17 announcement, 
<br>focusing on the cancellation of the Program of Record rather 
<br>than the new MD architecture.  While the new phased adaptive 
<br>approach to MD does not pose a threat to Russia, there will 
<br>likely continue to be missile defense elements in 
<br>central-eastern Europe, with an SM-3 site in Poland if the 
<br>Government of Poland agrees.  However, the physical 
<br>characteristics of the new system are different from the old, 
<br>and the U.S. believes Russia has no basis for concern that 
<br>the system could threaten its strategic forces.  The new 
<br>architecture will be more effective and be able to provide 
<br>protection to vulnerable parts of Europe more quickly. 
<br>Vershbow emphasized that the U.S. intends to be open about 
<br>the new architecture, citing information available through 
<br>congressional testimony and other open sources.  The U.S. aim 
<br>is to make this a project for NATO because the system is 
<br>designed to protect all of NATO's territory (starting in 
<br>southeastern Europe, where the current threat is, but 
<br>eventually covering all of NATO). 
<br> 
<br>¶20.  (C) ASD Vershbow affirmed the U.S. also views missile 
<br>defense as an opportunity for cooperation with Russia against 
<br>a common threat, noting Secretary of Defense Gates' support 
<br>for cooperation on missile defense.  Vershbow emphasized to 
<br>Zavarzin and Security Council Deputy Secretary Baluyevskiy 
<br>that we should begin by implementing the Joint Data Exchange 
<br>Center (JDEC), on which the Russians had postponed a decision 
<br>until after the U.S. missile defense announcement.  Vershbow 
<br>told Zavarzin and Baluyevskiy that linking radars could 
<br>follow, which could then lead to broader areas of cooperation 
<br>that could be implemented either bilaterally or within the 
<br>NATO-Russia Council (NRC) framework.  He suggested that U.S. 
<br>and Russian experts explore concrete ways to implement 
<br>military technical cooperation, noting that such cooperation 
<br>would be mutually beneficial and would send a strong signal 
<br>to Iran that could help in resolving the nuclear issue. 
<br> 
<br>¶21.  (C) Zavarzin acknowledged that the Russian political 
<br>elite has no illusions about missile defense and understands 
<br>this was a U.S. decision with no quid pro quo expected from 
<br>Russia.  Security Council Deputy Secretary Baluyevskiy noted 
<br>that the system's planned capability to intercept ICBMs does 
<br>raise some of the same concerns Russia has had before. 
<br>Zavarzin agreed that we need to identify specific projects to 
<br>work on together, but that Russia wants to ensure its voice 
<br>will be heard.  Both Zavarzin and Baluyevskiy stressed the 
<br>need to develop bilateral cooperation methods, potentially by 
<br>linking existing U.S. and Russian early warning systems to 
<br>gather and share information about threats.  They also asked 
<br>whether the U.S. was prepared to go even farther, to include 
<br>joint technology projects, which would of greater interest to 
<br>Russia than information exchange. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>U.S.-RUSSIAN UNITY ON IRAN? 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶22.  (C) ASD Vershbow discussed the serious test that Iran's 
<br>nuclear program will pose to both Russia and the U.S. in the 
<br>coming months, noting that our interests coincide in many 
<br>ways, even if they are not identical.  The U.S., he stated, 
<br>wants to see if diplomacy can succeed, but we need to be 
<br>realistic and be prepared for tougher measures if diplomacy 
<br>fails.  Citing the recently exposed covert nuclear facility 
<br>and the recent missile tests, Vershbow described the 
<br>situation as urgent, and said that the U.S. was encouraged by 
<br>President Medvedev's recent comment that sanctions might 
<br>become necessary. 
<br> 
<br>¶23.  (C) ASD Vershbow mentioned that the Islamic world is 
<br>very concerned about Iran's nuclear program (e.g., several of 
<br>its Arab neighbors have asked the U.S. for Patriot missiles 
<br>and other measures to protect them against Iranian attack). 
<br>The ability of the U.S. and Russia to work together on the 
<br>Iran challenge over the next few months will be just as 
<br>important as our work on missile defense will be over the 
<br>next few years.  ASD Vershbow stressed that if we fail to 
<br>stop Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons, we could have a 
<br>"volatile, possibly explosive," situation in the Middle East. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶24.  (C) In their respective meetings, Duma Defense Committee 
<br>Chairman Zavarzin and Security Council Deputy Secretary 
<br>Baluyevskiy agreed that Iran is a concern, but said that 
<br>Russia continues to work closely with them and that sanctions 
<br>cannot be pursued until after diplomatic efforts have been 
<br>made.  Deputy Foreign Minister Borodavkin expressed concern 
<br>that sanctions could be ineffective (citing past experience 
<br>in Iraq) and could have a negative impact on the wider 
<br>Islamic world. 
<br> 
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br>RUSSIA'S "SPHERE OF PRIVILEGED INTEREST" 
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶25.  (C) ASD Vershbow stated in several meetings that our 
<br>interaction in the post-Soviet space continues to be a 
<br>sensitive issue and, if not handled carefully, could 
<br>undermine recent gains in bilateral relations.  In this 
<br>regard, President Medvedev's proposed amendment to the law on 
<br>use of Russian forces overseas has raised many questions. 
<br>Duma Defense Committee Chairman Zavarzin said that Russia 
<br>will not interfere with the U.S. as it engages with nations 
<br>in the region, and that there is no cause for concern 
<br>regarding the legislation about use of Russian forces -- it 
<br>is intended to protect Russian citizens living in those 
<br>countries and that other countries have similar provisions. 
<br> 
<br>¶26.  (C) UKRAINE:  ASD Vershbow spoke of his visit to Ukraine 
<br>immediately preceding his arrival in Moscow, and cited 
<br>Ukrainian concerns about Russian respect for Ukraine's 
<br>sovereignty and borders.  Vershbow stated that the U.S. 
<br>continues to support the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security 
<br>Assurances and Ukraine's freedom to choose its security 
<br>relationships, and encourages Russia to reaffirm its 
<br>adherence as well.  He suggested that President Medvedev's 
<br>open letter to Ukraine had been counter-productive.  The U.S. 
<br>favors close and mutually beneficial Russian-Ukrainian 
<br>relations -- this is not a zero-sum game. 
<br> 
<br>¶27.  (C) Deputy Foreign Minister Karasin said that Ukraine is 
<br>Russia's closest neighbor, and is a "key partner" in 
<br>international activities.  Russia is not trying to influence 
<br>Ukraine, but wants a stable Ukraine and a secure 
<br>neighborhood.  He also said that Russia cannot ignore 
<br>attempts to depict it as a major threat to Ukraine.  Foreign 
<br>Minister Lavrov will be visiting Ukraine this week to meet 
<br>with Ukrainian Acting Foreign Minister Khandogiy and there 
<br>even is a possibility that Medvedev and Ukrainian President 
<br>Yushchenko will meet at a summit of CIS countries shortly 
<br>after that.  Karasin said that Russia wants to deal with 
<br>Ukraine in a normal way and that Ukrainian citizens are the 
<br>ones to decide what they want. 
<br> 
<br>¶28.  (C) GEORGIA:  Security Council Deputy Secretary 
<br>Baluyevskiy, Zavarzin, and Karasin asked why the U.S. is 
<br>providing military assistance to Georgia when it threatens 
<br>stability in the Caucasus region.  This causes concern and 
<br>Russia cannot allow renewed aggression against Abkhazia and 
<br>South Ossetia.  ASD Vershbow explained that as a matter of 
<br>principle, the U.S. will help Georgia protect its sovereignty 
<br>and independence, but stated that the U.S. is not rearming 
<br>Georgia, as Russia has repeatedly alleged.  Since the August 
<br>2008 war, there has been no U.S. lethal assistance to 
<br>Georgia; DoD funds were transferred to the State Department 
<br>for humanitarian purposes.  In the short term, the U.S. is 
<br>proceeding with great care and focusing on training, 
<br>education, and helping prepare Georgia to participate in 
<br>Afghanistan under the command of U.S. Forces.  At the same 
<br>time, Georgia is a sovereign state with the right to 
<br>self-defense.  We do not accept any arms embargo, and we may 
<br>provide weapons to Georgia in the future. 
<br> 
<br>¶29.  (C) Zavarzin made a point of saying that Russia does not 
<br>dispute Georgia's sovereignty, but it cannot allow new acts 
<br>of aggression; a regional consensus is necessary.  Karasin 
<br>said that, in Russia's view, the current Georgian leadership 
<br>is irresponsible.  ASD Vershbow reiterated that the U.S. had 
<br>made clear to Georgia that there is no military option 
<br>regarding Abkhazia and South Ossetia and that the Georgians 
<br>need to take a long view on reintegration of the territories. 
<br> Karasin noted some successes in repairing relations since 
<br>last August, including the Geneva talks that enable the 
<br>Georgians to talk directly to the Abkhaz and Ossetians. 
<br>Vershbow said that stability in the Caucasus and creating 
<br>conditions to help improve Georgian-Russian relations is very 
<br>important to the U.S. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶30.  (C) Karasin mentioned the EU independent report on the 
<br>August 2008 conflict in Georgia, which had just been released 
<br>on the afternoon of September 30.  ASD Vershbow mentioned 
<br>that he looked forward to reading the report and stressed 
<br>that even if we do not agree completely on the report's 
<br>findings, we need to look ahead and promote stability in the 
<br>region, including an international presence in the 
<br>territories.  Karasin said that international presence in 
<br>Abkhazia and South Ossetia must be discussed with the Abkhaz 
<br>and the Ossetians (not the Russians).  Russia has "bilateral 
<br>agreements" with them, and Russian border guards are 
<br>protecting them to help restore stability. 
<br> 
<br>¶31.  (C) Karasin asked whether the U.S. intends to establish 
<br>a military presence in Georgia by contributing personnel to 
<br>the EU Monitoring Mission (EUMM).  This would be a serious 
<br>problem for Russia, as they believe it would send the wrong 
<br>message to President Saakashvili that he could use force 
<br>again.  ASD Vershbow said there has been lots of speculation 
<br>on this subject that was not based on fact.  If the EUMM did 
<br>make such a request in the future, the U.S. would consider 
<br>it, but this would likely involve civilian monitors. 
<br>Vershbow added that Russia needs to fully withdraw its forces 
<br>from positions beyond the line of the outbreak of hostility, 
<br>per the Medvedev-Sarkozy agreement, since this non-compliance 
<br>was a continuing source of tension.  Karasin insisted that 
<br> 
<br>Russia was in compliance, while acknowledging that the U.S. 
<br>does not see it that way.

<br>OTHER ISSUES 
<br>------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶32.  (C) EUROPEAN SECURITY TREATY:  In response to 
<br>Baluyevskiy's inquiry about President Medvedev's proposed 
<br>European Security Treaty, ASD Vershbow acknowledged there 
<br>could be ways to improve the effectiveness of existing 
<br>conflict-prevention mechanisms, but that the U.S. and most of 
<br>our allies did not see a need for new structures or a new 
<br>treaty.  However, the U.S. is ready to engage with Russia on 
<br>this issue in the Corfu process and other fora. 
<br> 
<br>¶33.  (C) CENTRAL ASIA:  Karasin inquired about the Manas 
<br>Transit Center and the numbers of U.S. military personnel 
<br>that would be deployed under the new arrangement.  ASD 
<br>Vershbow said that he did not have precise figures.  However, 
<br>in contrast with the previous agreement, security for the 
<br>facility is now being provided by the Kyrgyz, which reduced 
<br>the U.S. presence somewhat. 
<br> 
<br>¶34.  (U) ASD Vershbow has cleared this cable.
