<br>France - 2005 
<br>
<br>OVERVIEW 
<br>
<br>In 2005, France continued to discover and dismantle terror 
<br>networks present on its soil, including several that 
<br>recruited jihadists to Iraq. Following the July bombings in 
<br>London, French officials worked closely with their British 
<br>counterparts. They also perceived a number of deficiencies 
<br>in their counterterrorism capabilities, and proposed 
<br>legislation to remedy these deficiencies. This legislation 
<br>is expected to enter into force in early 2006. From March 
<br>on, the French government has worked to draft a white book on 
<br>terrorism, with publication expected by the end of the year. 
<br>A conference in October about the white book underscored the 
<br>French government,s belief that terrorism is a primary 
<br>strategic threat to France, and that dealing with it is 
<br>consequentially a central priority. France consults 
<br>extensively with the U.S. on terrorism, at the tactical and 
<br>strategic level. In general, counterterrorism cooperation 
<br>between the U.S. and France is excellent. 
<br>
<br>INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES 
<br>
<br>France continues to be an active and engaged participant in 
<br>the international war against terrorism. On the military 
<br>front, its special forces participate in counterterrorist 
<br>operations in Afghanistan and as a part of Task Force 150, a 
<br>multinational naval force that patrols the Red Sea and the 
<br>Persian Gulf to interdict the movement of suspected 
<br>terrorists from Afghanistan to the Arabian Peninsula. In 
<br>Afghanistan, French Mirage-2000 fighters have flown with USAF 
<br>fighters to assist American and Afghan ground troops. At the 
<br>political and diplomatic level, France continues its 
<br>engagement within the UNSC Counterterrorism Committee and the 
<br>G-8,s Counterterrorism Action Group. France is a party to 
<br>all 12 international conventions and protocols relating to 
<br>terrorism. 
<br>
<br>France and the United States continue to cooperate closely on 
<br>border security issues, including aviation security and the 
<br>Container Security Initiative. French police and security 
<br>services have been very responsive to US requests. In 
<br>addition, France is active internationally in proposing 
<br>bioterrorism safeguards and nuclear facility safeguards. The 
<br>U.S. and France continue their dialogue on nuclear security 
<br>cooperation. 
<br>
<br>On terrorism financing, France continues to develop the 
<br>competencies and capabilities of TRACFIN, the Ministry of 
<br>Finance,s terrorism financing coordination and investigation 
<br>unit. TRACFIN has expanded the number of economic sectors it 
<br>monitors within the French economy, with a particular 
<br>emphasis on institutions, non-governmental organizations and 
<br>small enterprises suspected of having ties to Islamic 
<br>terrorism. It has also strengthened its coordination with 
<br>justice and security officials. Within the European Union, 
<br>France plays an active role in the Clearinghouse, the EU,s 
<br>terrorism financing coordination body. France has designated 
<br>as terrorist groups those that appear on the EU list of 
<br>terrorist organizations. France has not designated 
<br>Hamas-affiliated charities, such as the French-based Comite 
<br>de Bienfaisance et de Secours aux Palestiniens, arguing that 
<br>they have no proven links to terrorism. France also opposes 
<br>EU designation of Lebanese Hizballah as a terrorist 
<br>organization, though it supports Hizballah's eventual 
<br>disarmament, which the GoF maintains will be the result of 
<br>Hizballah's gradual integration into Lebanese politics. 
<br>
<br>French authorities consistently condemn terrorist acts and 
<br>have made no public statements in support of a 
<br>terrorist-supporting country on a terrorism issue. 
<br>Nevertheless, France, along with its EU partners, retains 
<br>diplomatic relations with all of the governments designated 
<br>as state sponsors of terrorism, with the exception of North 
<br>Korea. It continues to cooperate closely with the United 
<br>States in pressing for the implementation of UN Security 
<br>Council Resolution 1559, which targeted Syrian domination of 
<br>Lebanon and called for the dismantlement of armed groups and 
<br>militias in Lebanon (including Hizballah) and extension of 
<br>Lebanese government control throughout Lebanese territory, to 
<br>include areas under the de facto control of Hizballah. 
<br>
<br>French and Spanish authorities have jointly made significant 
<br>progress in combatting Basque separatist groups, including 
<br>the ETA. French-Spanish investigative teams focusing on 
<br>al-Qaida-related groups and Basque separatist groups continue 
<br>to function. In the first use of the EU arrest warrant for 
<br>terrorism, French authorities extradited ETA suspect Unai 
<br>Berrosteguieta Eguiara to Spain on February 18. 
<br>
<br>DOMESTIC ACTIVITIES 
<br>
<br>France is perhaps best known for its counterterrorism police 
<br>forces and judiciary. Within the Ministry of Interior, the 
<br>DST (internal security service), RG (police intelligence), 
<br>DNAT (counterterrorism brigade) and Brigade Criminelle 
<br>(criminal investigations) all play important roles in French 
<br>counterterrorism work. A number of organizations coordinate 
<br>the activities of the counterterrorist forces, including 
<br>UCLAT (a counterterrorism coordination unit with the Ministry 
<br>of Interior), the SGDN (attached to the office of the Prime 
<br>Minister) and the Council for Internal Security (attached to 
<br>the office of the President.) Although there is little 
<br>legislative oversight of intelligence and security agencies, 
<br>Interior Minister Sarkozy proposed in late November the 
<br>creation of an oversight working group that will include 
<br>members of French intelligence and legislators. Sarkozy 
<br>promised to submit a draft law on this issue by February 15, 
<br>¶2006. 
<br>
<br>The counterterrorism section of the Paris Prosecutor,s 
<br>office usually leads the French government,s terrorism 
<br>investigations. Investigative judges, who in the French 
<br>system combine prosecutorial and judicial powers, concentrate 
<br>on Islamic/international terrorism, Basque/ETA terrorism and 
<br>terrorism linked to Corsican separatist groups. Their 
<br>mandate is extensive, and includes terrorist acts on French 
<br>soil and acts abroad that affect French citizens. Their 
<br>powers are substantial and they are given wide freedom to 
<br>investigate. They cooperate closely with French police and 
<br>security services. In March, then-Justice Minister Dominique 
<br>Perben announced the hiring of four additional terrorism 
<br>investigating judges, along with additional support staff, 
<br>bringing the number of specialized terrorism investigating 
<br>judges to nine. 
<br>
<br>French police and intelligence services within the Interior 
<br>Ministry have extensive powers of surveillance, monitoring 
<br>and detention. These powers were enhanced with the 2004 
<br>passage of the Perben II law and include expanded detention 
<br>(up to four days before charges must be brought), more 
<br>authority for police to go undercover, warrants for searches 
<br>at night, more leeway in granting document searches, and 
<br>increased authority to wiretap. These expanded powers are to 
<br>be used only in cases that involve investigation of 
<br>organizations "that imperil society," such as the mafia, drug 
<br>traffickers and terrorist organizations. Even if government 
<br>authorities are found to have misused their new powers, any 
<br>evidence they have found would still be accepted in court. 
<br>
<br>The French government continues its policy of expulsions for 
<br>non-French citizens engaged in activities that promote hate. 
<br>Interior Minister Sarkozy stated in August that France was 
<br>monitoring dozens of radical imams. He also announced 
<br>October 4 that 19 Islamic extremists had been expelled from 
<br>France since the beginning of the year; 102 have been 
<br>expelled since 2002. In March, the CSA, France,s 
<br>FCC-equivalent, ordered the Eutelstat satellite company to 
<br>cease transmitting Sahar 1, an Iranian television station, 
<br>because of its anti-Semitic and hate-filled broadcasting. 
<br>Following the CSA,s banning of Hizballah-affiliated Al-Manar 
<br>satellite television, Hizballah deputies lobbied the French 
<br>government in 2005 to lift the ban. Separately, the Conseil 
<br>d,Etat, France,s highest administrative court, is reviewing 
<br>an appeal by Al-Manar to reinstate its broadcasting license. 
<br>
<br>France remains worried over the rise of radical Islam. 
<br>According to a November 12 press report, the RG, France,s 
<br>police intelligence service, kept 350 places under 
<br>surveillance (including 42 Islamic prayer halls and 300 
<br>businesses) during the first seven months of 2005 because of 
<br>suspicions of radical Islamist activity. The RG estimates 
<br>that, of the approximately 5 million Muslims in France, 
<br>200,000 are practicing and of that number, between 5,000 and 
<br>9,000 are linked to extremist causes. 
<br>
<br>French officials are also concerned regarding the role of 
<br>prisons in converting petty criminals to jihadism. Prisons 
<br>served as a center of recruitment for the Safe Bourrada 
<br>terror network (dismantled in late September, see below). 
<br>According to statistics provided by the Ministry of Justice 
<br>in September, 358 people are imprisoned for terrorism; 159 
<br>are Basque-related, 94 are Islamic extremists and 76 are 
<br>Corsica-related. France has proposed several measures to 
<br>address Islamic extremism in prisons, including the 
<br>establishment of a corps of moderate Muslim prison chaplains. 
<br>
<br>The July bombings in London caused many French officials to 
<br>reexamine their counterterrorism capabilities. In addition 
<br>to the initial reaction of elevating the Vigipirate alert 
<br>system and coordinating closely with British officials, the 
<br>French government soon proposed a new counterterrorist bill 
<br>that calls for increasing video surveillance in public areas, 
<br>allowing police more access to phone and Internet records, 
<br>and more closely monitoring international travel by ship, 
<br>rail and plane. 
<br>Under French law, terrorism suspects may be detained for up 
<br>to 96 hours before charges are filed. The new bill making 
<br>its way through the legislature proposes extending the 
<br>96-hour period an additional 48 hours, for a maximum total 
<br>detention of 144 hours. Suspects can be held for up to three 
<br>and a half years in pretrial detention while the 
<br>investigation against them continues. Other proposed 
<br>measures in the bill include increasing the maximum penalty 
<br>for association with a terrorist enterprise from 10 to 20 
<br>years in prison, and increasing the maximum penalty for 
<br>terrorist enterprise organizers from 20 to 30 years in 
<br>prison. The National Assembly approved the bill in late 
<br>November. The Senate is expected to take up discussion of 
<br>the bill in December, with probable approval in January 2006. 
<br>
<br>Another reaction to the July bombings in London was a 
<br>decision by the French government to encourage the heads of 
<br>its domestic intelligence agencies - RG and the DST - to take 
<br>on more public roles, in order to sensitize the public to the 
<br>threat of terrorism. In a related action, the French 
<br>government, in coordination with a local think-tank, opened a 
<br>public website focused on the details of past terrorist acts, 
<br>at https://bdt.frstrategie.org 
<br>
<br>French police and security officials conducted a large-scale 
<br>exercise in November that simulated multiple chemical attacks 
<br>throughout Paris. Local prefectures, especially Paris, have 
<br>instituted PRM, a French acronym for "plan red - multiple" 
<br>that focuses attention on the prospect of multiple attacks, 
<br>either simultaneous or sequential. A similar large-scale 
<br>chemical attack simulation took place May 9 in the Val 
<br>d,Oise region. In addition, the Paris Prefecture has 
<br>created a specialized NRBC unit of firefighters. 
<br>
<br>MAJOR COUNTERTERRORIST ACTIONS - 2005 
<br>
<br>On January 26, French police arrested eleven people (three of 
<br>whom were eventually charged with terrorism conspiracy) in 
<br>Paris, 19th arrondissement for reportedly recruiting young 
<br>French residents to launch terrorist attacks in Iraq. It was 
<br>the first arrest since the opening in September 2004 of an 
<br>investigation by the Paris Prosecutor,s office into 
<br>"jihadists to Iraq." French intelligence, security and 
<br>judicial authorities have consistently identified the 
<br>conflict in Iraq as an attractive force for French jihadists. 
<br>French officials stated in November that 22 young people had 
<br>left for Iraq, and at least seven had been killed there, 
<br>including two suicide bombers. 
<br>
<br>Djamel Beghal, the ringleader of a group arrested in 2001 on 
<br>suspicion of planning to bomb the U.S. Embassy in Paris, was 
<br>convicted March 15 of "terrorist conspiracy," and received a 
<br>maximum 10-year sentence. His five accomplices were all 
<br>found guilty as well, and received sentences ranging from one 
<br>year to nine years in prison. 
<br>
<br>The last three French nationals detained at Guantanamo were 
<br>transferred to French custody on March 7, following the 
<br>transfer of four nationals in 2004. France released Mustaq 
<br>Ali Patel in March and Imad Kanouni in July. The other five 
<br>remain in pretrial detention and may be charged with 
<br>terrorist conspiracy. The former Guantanamo detainees, 
<br>detention has withstood multiple appeals by defense lawyers. 
<br>France has been one of the most aggressive and proactive 
<br>countries in prosecuting its citizens formerly held by the 
<br>U.S. at Guantanamo. 
<br>
<br>On April 24, French police in Paris arrested Said 
<br>al-Maghrebi, an Afghanistan training camp veteran, on 
<br>suspicion of organizing potential jihadists to fight in Iraq. 
<br>Four others reportedly belonging to al-Maghrebi,s network 
<br>were arrested in Paris and Marseilles. Two were later 
<br>released. 
<br>
<br>A French court on May 16 declared five people guilty of 
<br>organizing logistic support for the suicide bombers who 
<br>assassinated Afghan Commander Ahmad Sheikh Massoud on 
<br>September 9, 2001. The five were sentenced to between two 
<br>and nine years imprisonment. 
<br>
<br>On May 20, a Paris court condemned Corsican nationalist 
<br>Charles Pieri to 10 years in prison for terrorism finance 
<br>conspiracy and extortion. 
<br>
<br>French police arrested Hamid Bach on June 21 in the city of 
<br>Montpellier on suspicions of organizing a terrorist ring 
<br>focused on attacking targets in France and sending potential 
<br>jihadists to Iraq. 
<br>
<br>French police arrested 9 people in late September on 
<br>suspicion of belonging to a terrorist group. According to 
<br>press reports, the group, reportedly led by GSPC sympathizer 
<br>and convicted terrorist Safe Bourrada, was in the initial 
<br>phases of planning terrorist attacks against targets in 
<br>France, including the Paris Metro, Orly airport and the 
<br>headquarters of the DST, France,s internal security service. 
<br>Four more suspected members of the Bourrada network were 
<br>arrested in early October. 
<br>
<br>On November 29, French police arrested six people suspected 
<br>of financing extremist and terrorist causes. One of them was 
<br>a prison guard and two were former Islamic chaplains. The 
<br>group reportedly had visited Bosnia and attempted to recruit 
<br>jihadists to Iraq. The group belonged to the fundamentalist 
<br>Tabligh movement. 
<br>
<br>British authorities transferred Rashid Ramda to French 
<br>custody on December 1. Ramda is the suspected financier of 
<br>the 1995 GIA attacks in the Saint-Michel RER train station, 
<br>the Musee d,Orsay RER train station and the Maison-Blanche 
<br>metro station. Ramda had been in British custody for the 
<br>last ten years, and his extradition to France removes a major 
<br>irritant in French-British relations. 
<br>
<br>On December 12, French police arrested approximately 25 
<br>people, in the largest terror-related sweep in Europe since 
<br>the aftermath of the Madrid bombings in 2004. Those arrested 
<br>are suspected of involvement with terrorist financing. The 
<br>reported ringleader is Ouassini Cherifi, a French-Algerian 
<br>who had spent time in prison for passport fraud. French 
<br>police suspect he, like Safe Bourrada, recruited low-level 
<br>criminals to his network while in prison. 
<br>
<br>Judicial investigations following the arrests in 2003 of 
<br>German national Christian Ganczarski and Moroccan national 
<br>Karim Mehdi continued in 2005. Ganczarski and Mehdi, who are 
<br>suspected of ties to al-Qaida, remain in pretrial detention 
<br>in France. 
<br>
<br>The judicial investigation into the activities of six 
<br>suspected members of the Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group 
<br>(GICM) arrested in 2004 continues. The six suspects are 
<br>being held in pretrial detention and are thought to have 
<br>provided logistical support to those who committed the 
<br>attacks against Madrid trains on March 11, 2004. 
<br>
<br>Investigations into the "Chechen network," a loose grouping 
<br>that is reported to have links with the Beghal network and 
<br>the Frankfurt network (which attempted in 2000 to attack 
<br>cultural sites in Strasbourg, including the cathedral) have 
<br>concluded, although a trial date for those arrested has not 
<br>been set. Members of the Chechen network reportedly were 
<br>interested in using chemical agents to commit terrorist 
<br>attacks. Several suspected members of the Chechen network 
<br>were arrested in France in 2005. 
<br>
<br>Corsica continues to experience low-level terrorist 
<br>activities. Recent attacks have occurred against peoples of 
<br>North African ancestry. The FLNC Union of Combatants claimed 
<br>responsibility for firing a rocket on September 29 at the 
<br>prefecture in Ajaccio. The rocket attack did not cause any 
<br>injuries, although it exploded a few meters from where the 
<br>prefect and a receptionist were working.
