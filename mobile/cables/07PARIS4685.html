<br> 
<br>SUMMARY 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (C) That the first international follow-on to Annapolis 
<br>is taking place in Paris reflects the new confidence and 
<br>greater cooperation that characterize our relationship with 
<br>France seven months into the Presidency of Nicolas Sarkozy. 
<br>France's support for our efforts to achieve peace in the 
<br>Middle East contrasts sharply with its previous preferred 
<br>role as a side-line critic.  It is just one example of the 
<br>broader re-positioning of France vis-a-vis the U.S. which we 
<br>have been quick to recognize and take advantage of. 
<br>Sarkozy's desire to maximize France's influence by working 
<br>with the U.S. to address common challenges is the 
<br>international component of a larger ambition for his 
<br>five-year Presidency: to renew France though deep reform at 
<br>home and resumption of its leadership in Europe.  With an 
<br>exceptionally long political honeymoon behind him, Sarkozy is 
<br>now pressing ahead with his domestic reform agenda.  He has 
<br>met with predictable opposition (most dramatically in the 
<br>form of transport strikes), and some questioning among 
<br>political allies of his strategy of undertaking sequential, 
<br>calibrated reform rather than a Thatcherite big bang at the 
<br>outset of his term.  Despite the difficulty of the challenge, 
<br>including an unsettled international economic context, and 
<br>little budgetary room for maneuver, Sarkozy remains 
<br>determined to see his program through.  Given his dominant 
<br>political position, that remains a realistic prospect.  An 
<br>activist on the international scene, with an opportunistic 
<br>eye for grabbing attention and credit, Sarkozy will remain a 
<br>challenging partner despite his desire to improve the 
<br>bilateral relationship.  He has concentrated responsibility 
<br>for foreign affairs in the Presidency to an unprecedented 
<br>degree, while Foreign Minister Kouchner has focused on 
<br>selected policy issues.  This message also addresses the 
<br>specifics of France's Middle East policies.  While under 
<br>Sarkozy the French are more supportive, our collaboration 
<br>(and intra-GOF coordination) on Lebanon has of late not been 
<br>as close as it should be, as Sarkozy's team in the Elysee has 
<br>focused single-mindedly on electing a President while 
<br>squeezing the democratically-elected majority and weakening 
<br>its ability to deal with post-election challenges.  End 
<br>Summary 
<br> 
<br>THE RELATIONSHIP 
<br>---------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (C) Madame Secretary, The seven months since Nicolas 
<br>Sarkozy became President of France -- and the six months 
<br>since your last visit -- has been a remarkable period in 
<br>three respects.  First, our relationship with France has 
<br>undergone a significant qualitative change.  Sarkozy has set 
<br>in place a new paradigm for French foreign policy, one more 
<br>favorable to our interests.  Scrapping Chirac's worldview, 
<br>which equated French leadership with containing U.S. 
<br>hegemony, Sarkozy has articulated the need for France to work 
<br>closely with the U.S. -- in order to address common 
<br>challenges, but also as the surest way to increase France's 
<br>global influence.  France's increased involvement in and 
<br>commitment to Afghanistan, the beginning of a French interest 
<br>in Iraq, and France's consideration of a full return to NATO, 
<br>are the most symbolically powerful examples of France's 
<br>policy reorientation.  Second, we have ratcheted up our 
<br>cooperation with France across our foreign policy agenda, 
<br>particularly on Middle East issues, but also on Kosovo, 
<br>Burma, Sudan/Darfur and elsewhere.  In Lebanon, Sarkozy's 
<br>more activist foreign policy has already put the new 
<br>cooperative relationship to the test.  Third, over the past 
<br>seven months, Sarkozy has begun to implement the ambitious 
<br>platform of domestic reform he had promised as a candidate. 
<br> 
<br>SARKOZY 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C)  Before addressing the Middle East issues that will 
<br>be the focus of your visit here, a word on the domestic 
<br>context.  Sarkozy enjoyed an exceptionally long political 
<br>honeymoon, one which extended well into the Fall.  His 
<br>election -- representing the victory of a new-generation 
<br>leader, one with unmatched communication skills and a 
<br>detailed and ambitious program for renewing France -- led to 
<br>a season of national elan and optimism.  The return to normal 
<br> 
<br>PARIS 00004685  002.2 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>in the political life of the country over the past two months 
<br>was predictable, as Sarkozy's efforts to implement difficult 
<br>domestic changes have run into opposition from those -- such 
<br>as rail workers -- who stand to lose, and many others who 
<br>fear change of any kind.  Sarkozy has disappointed some in 
<br>his own camp for not immediately embarking on radical, 
<br>deep-rooted, pervasive reform, taking advantage of his 
<br>electoral mandate.  Instead, Sarkozy has decided to carefully 
<br>pick his battles, gaining momentum from each piecemeal 
<br>victory.  All in all, Sarkozy remains in a politically 
<br>powerful position, operating as the hands-on leader of a 
<br>largely unchecked executive branch, unencumbered for now by a 
<br>political opposition worthy of the name.  He is determined to 
<br>make his mark during his five year term (which he insists may 
<br>be his single term of office), but has demonstrated greater 
<br>caution than might have been expected, mindful of the 
<br>international economic and financial environment, and severe 
<br>budgetary constraints at home. 
<br> 
<br>KOUCHNER 
<br>-------- 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (C)  Sarkozy's foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, was 
<br>the prize catch in Sarkozy's opportunistic effort to appoint 
<br>figures of the center and center-left to his government, 
<br>thereby increasing its legitimacy and political heft (and 
<br>depleting that of the opposition) as he waged the domestic 
<br>reform battle.  While rumors circulate of a cabinet 
<br>re-shuffle early in the new year or following municipal 
<br>elections in March, Kouchner's position appears secure for 
<br>now.  (Defense Minister Morin and Interior Minister 
<br>Alliot-Marie are among those thought most imperiled.)  He 
<br>enjoys a personal chemistry with the President based on 
<br>Sarkozy's long-time admiration of Kouchner's personal and 
<br>political courage and humanitarian accomplishments.  Kouchner 
<br>remains very popular -- consistently scoring at or near the 
<br>top of the polls measuring the popularity of France's 
<br>political leaders.  But even his star quality (that he alone 
<br>in the government can claim) has not kept him from being 
<br>eclipsed by his hyper-active and media-savvy president. 
<br>Surely more of a concern to Kouchner, Sarkozy has 
<br>concentrated foreign policy decision-making and 
<br>implementation to an unprecedented degree in the Elysee, with 
<br>Secretary-General Claude Gueant and Diplomatic Advisor 
<br> 
<br>SIPDIS 
<br>Jean-David Levitte accruing as much if not more influence 
<br>than Kouchner.  Kouchner has largely focused on the issues 
<br>with which he has the greatest experience and level of 
<br>comfort -- Lebanon, Kosovo, and Darfur among them.  While he 
<br>has of late curbed his penchant for off-the-cuff, 
<br>undiplomatic public comments, the thin-skinned Kouchner has 
<br>shown irritation over the involvement of Elysee officials in 
<br>the delicate negotiations over Lebanon's presidential 
<br>elections, and he may be uncomfortable with Sarkozy's 
<br>increasing willingness to downgrade human rights 
<br>considerations in his dealings foreign leaders, as 
<br>demonstrated by the way he has kept his distance from the 
<br>ongoing five-day visit to Paris of Mu'ammar Qadhafi. 
<br> 
<br>Middle East 
<br>----------- 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (S)  Under Sarkozy, France's Middle East policies have 
<br>become more supportive of and congruent with U.S. interests, 
<br>but we are concerned that in the past few weeks our 
<br>collaboration (and intra-GOF coordination) on Lebanon has not 
<br>been what it should be, as Sarkozy's Presidency team has 
<br>focused single-mindedly on electing a President in such a way 
<br>that squeezes the democratically-elected majority and weakens 
<br>its ability to deal with post-election challenges. 
<br> 
<br>--Arab/Israeli peace:  The French remain major supporters of 
<br>our efforts focused on supporting the Israeli/Palestinian 
<br>negotiations.  Their eagerness to make Annapolis a success 
<br>and to host the Paris conference on assistance to the 
<br>Palestinians underscored this.  Sarkozy and Kouchner both 
<br>want France to be a key player in what they hope will be a 
<br>strong and successful push in 2008 to the creation of a 
<br>Palestinian state.  In many ways, France aspires to be a 
<br>favored additional partner to the Quartet.  Syrian 
<br>participation at Annapolis has also sparked hopeful 
<br>commentary in the French media that a larger dynamic -- in 
<br>which France can participate -- is underway that inter alia 
<br>would foster an unraveling of the Syrian/Iranian relationship 
<br>and halt Iranian inroads through support of Hizballah in 
<br>Lebanon.  Sarkozy and Kouchner will listen attentively to any 
<br> 
<br>PARIS 00004685  003.2 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>vision you may outline of how you expect the negotiations to 
<br>unfold and whether there is a reasonable expectation of them 
<br>broadening to include Syria. 
<br> 
<br>--Lebanon:  Even as the French have become a positive force 
<br>behind our efforts on behalf of Arab-Israeli peace, the close 
<br>collaboration with the GOF under former President Chirac, 
<br>with his single-minded focus on supporting Saad Hariri and 
<br>isolating Syria, has suffered.  This is partly due to the 
<br>extremely fluid situation in Lebanon.  But it also results 
<br>from the tug of war between Kouchner and the Elysee over who 
<br>is in charge of the issue, one that developed after it became 
<br>clear the deadline for electing a new president would pass 
<br>without a new candidate chosen.  There is abundant evidence 
<br>that the Syrians, possibly with help from the Amir of Qatar 
<br>(a friend of Sarkozy and President Bashar al-Asad), lured the 
<br>Elysee into leading a process with far different objectives 
<br>than the one Kouchner began last summer.  Whereas Kouchner 
<br>was focused on helping the Lebanese get out of their 
<br>political deadlock, Levitte and the Elysee have sought a 
<br>resolution of the presidential crisis that would satisfy 
<br>larger geopolitical aims involving Syria.  It is also clear 
<br>to us that the Elysee, given Sarkozy,s obsession with 
<br>achieving results, is focused on electing a president so that 
<br>it can be considered another French diplomatic triumph.  The 
<br>unfortunate net result continues to be the impression that 
<br>French pressure for a deal falls exclusively on the March 14 
<br>majority and not where it belongs -- on the March 8 
<br>opposition that is acting in close coordination with Syria 
<br>intent on wringing key concessions from the democratically 
<br>elected majority.  Even if the presidential crisis is 
<br>resolved by December 17, we would recommend that you discuss 
<br>with Kouchner and Sarkozy how we can more effectively work 
<br>together as we address the multitude of difficult challenges 
<br>facing Lebanon, of which the Presidential election is only 
<br>the first. 
<br> 
<br>--Iran:  The public release of the recent NIE on Iranian 
<br>nuclear capabilities was a shock to all but the highest 
<br>levels of the GOF, which was briefed on its conclusions. 
<br>Although the French have publicly backed our view that Iran 
<br>continues to pose a serious threat and further international 
<br>sanctions are warranted (a line echoed in most of the French 
<br>press), the GOF anticipates a major "communication problem" 
<br>with its EU partners, the Iranians, China, and Russia.  There 
<br>is further the delicate diplomacy France is undertaking with 
<br>different elements in the Iranian regime in order to maintain 
<br>a viable channel that bypasses President Ahmadinejad (who 
<br>appeared to complain about this in a recent letter to 
<br>Sarkozy).  In geostrategic terms, the French see Iran as the 
<br>primary threat to the Middle East and worry about inroads it 
<br>has made in Lebanon and Iraq.  As noted above, there is also 
<br>some thinking, at least among analysts outside the GOF, that 
<br>Annapolis and the NIE betoken a significant shift of U.S. 
<br>strategy in the Bush Administration's last year that involves 
<br>new U.S. thinking about Iran.  Sarkozy and Kouchner would 
<br>welcome anything you could share with respect to how we 
<br>regard Iran in a post-Annapolis Middle East. 
<br> 
<br>--Iraq:  French follow-up to Kouchner's visit to Baghdad last 
<br>August and Iraqi President Talabani's subsequent visit to 
<br>Paris has been slow.  Concern about the security situation, 
<br>despite what the French acknowledge to be marginal 
<br>improvements in some areas of Iraq, lack of coordination at 
<br>the working level among French ministries, and the failure so 
<br>far to achieve a breakthrough on national reconciliation have 
<br>slowed or prevented follow-on French engagement.  Kouchner, 
<br>however, did ask SecDef Gates for a list of specific areas in 
<br>which we thought France could be helpful.  We should use that 
<br>opening to engage the French in a more active dialogue 
<br>between representatives of our respective interagencies.  We 
<br>recommend that you use the opportunity to inquire about 
<br>Kouchner's current thinking about French assistance to Iraq 
<br>and let him know we would like to send an interagency team to 
<br>Paris early in the New Year to begin these discussions.  We 
<br>would further recommend that you ask Kouchner about his 
<br>efforts to rally EU support for and to promote meaningful 
<br>engagement with the Iraqi government.  You might also praise 
<br>his personal commitment to Iraq's success, as demonstrated in 
<br>part by his participation in the recent Istanbul summit.  We 
<br>understand Kouchner may next visit Iraq in February when 
<br>France is expected to open an embassy office in Irbil.
