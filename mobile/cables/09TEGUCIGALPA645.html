<br>SUBJECT: TFHO1: OPEN AND SHUT: THE CASE OF THE HONDURAN COUP 
<br> 
<br>REF: TEGUCIGALPA 578 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Hugo Llorens, reasons 1.4 (b and d) 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) Summary:  Post has attempted to clarify some of the 
<br>legal and constitutional issues surrounding the June 28 
<br>forced removal of President Manuel "Mel" Zelaya.  The 
<br>Embassy perspective is that there is no doubt that the 
<br>military, Supreme Court and National Congress conspired 
<br>on June 28 in what constituted an illegal and 
<br>unconstitutional coup against the Executive Branch, while 
<br>accepting that there may be a prima facie case that Zelaya 
<br>may 
<br>have committed illegalities and may have even violated the 
<br>constitution.  There is equally no doubt from our perspective 
<br>that Roberto Micheletti's assumption of power was 
<br>illegitimate.  Nevertheless, it is also evident that the 
<br>constitution itself may be deficient in terms of providing 
<br>clear procedures for dealing with alleged illegal acts by 
<br>the President and resolving conflicts between the branches 
<br>of government.  End summary. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (U) Since the June 28 removal and expulsion of President 
<br>Zelaya by the Honduran armed forces, the Embassy has 
<br>consulted Honduran legal experts (one cannot find a fully 
<br>unbiased professional legal opinion in Honduras in the 
<br>current politically charged atmosphere) and reviewed the 
<br>text of the Honduran Constitution and its laws to develop a 
<br>better understanding of the arguments being parlayed by the 
<br>coup's supporters and opponents. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>Arguments of the Coup Defenders 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (SBU) Defenders of the June 28 coup have offered some 
<br>combination of the following, often ambiguous, arguments to 
<br>assert it's legality: 
<br> 
<br>-- Zelaya had broken the law (alleged but not proven); 
<br> 
<br>-- Zelaya resigned (a clear fabrication); 
<br> 
<br>-- Zelaya intended to extend his term in office 
<br>(supposition); 
<br> 
<br>-- Had he been allowed to proceed with his June 28 
<br>constitutional reform opinion poll, Zelaya would have 
<br>dissolved Congress the following day and convened a 
<br>constituent assembly (supposition); 
<br> 
<br>-- Zelaya had to be removed from the country to prevent a 
<br>bloodbath; 
<br> 
<br>-- Congress "unanimously" (or in some versions by a 123-5 
<br>vote) deposed Zelaya; (after the fact and under the cloak 
<br>of secrecy); and 
<br> 
<br>-- Zelaya "automatically" ceased to be president the moment 
<br>he suggested modifying the constitutional prohibition on 
<br>presidential reelection. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) In our view, none of the above arguments has any 
<br>substantive validity under the Honduran constitution.  Some 
<br>are outright false.  Others are mere supposition or ex-post 
<br>rationalizations of a patently illegal act.  Essentially: 
<br> 
<br>-- the military had no authority to remove Zelaya from the 
<br>country; 
<br> 
<br>-- Congress has no constitutional authority to remove a 
<br>Honduran president; 
<br> 
<br>-- Congress and the judiciary removed Zelaya on the basis 
<br>of a hasty, ad-hoc, extralegal, secret, 48-hour process; 
<br> 
<br>-- the purported "resignation" letter was a fabrication and 
<br>was not even the basis for Congress's action of June 28; 
<br>and 
<br> 
<br>-- Zelaya's arrest and forced removal from the country 
<br>violated multiple constitutional guarantees, including the 
<br>prohibition on expatriation, presumption of innocence and 
<br>right to due process. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------------------- 
<br>Impeachment under the Honduran Constitution 
<br>------------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (U) Under the Honduran Constitution as currently 
<br>written, the President may be removed only on the basis of 
<br>death, resignation or incapacitation.  Only the Supreme 
<br>Court may determine that a President has been 
<br>"incapacitated" on the basis of committing a crime. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (U) There is no explicit impeachment procedure in the 
<br>1982 Honduran Constitution.  Originally, Article 205-15 
<br>stated that Congress had the competence to determine 
<br>whether "cause" existed against the President, but it did 
<br>not stipulate on what grounds or under what procedure. 
<br>Article 319-2 stated that the Supreme Court would "hear" 
<br>cases of official or common crimes committed by high-level 
<br>officials, upon a finding of cause by the Congress.  This 
<br>implied a vague two-step executive impeachment process 
<br>involving the other two branches of government, although 
<br>without specific criteria or procedures.  However, Article 
<br>205 was abrogated in 2003, and the corresponding provision 
<br>of Article 319 (renumbered 313) was revised to state only 
<br>that the Supreme Court would hear "processes initiated" 
<br>against high officials.  Thus, it appears that under the 
<br>Constitution as currently written, removal of a president 
<br>or a government official is an entirely judicial matter. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (U) Respected legal opinion confirms that the removal of 
<br>a president is a judicial matter. According to a 2006 book 
<br>by respected legal scholar Enrique Flores Valeriano -- late 
<br>father of Zelaya's Minister of the Presidency, Enrique 
<br>Flores Lanza -- Article 112 of the Law of Constitutional 
<br>Justice indicates that if any government official is found 
<br>to be in violation of the Constitution, that person should 
<br>be removed from office immediately with the ultimate 
<br>authority on matters of Constitutionality being the Supreme 
<br>Court. 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (U) Many legal experts have also confirmed to us that 
<br>the Honduran process for impeaching a President or other 
<br>senior-level officials is a judicial procedure.  They 
<br>assert that under Honduran law the process consists of formal 
<br>criminal charges being filed by the Attorney General 
<br>against the accused with the Supreme Court.  The Supreme 
<br>Court could accept or reject the charges.  If the Court 
<br>moved to indict, it would assign a Supreme Court 
<br>magistrate, or a panel of magistrates to investigate the 
<br>matter, 
<br>and oversee the trial.  The trial process is open and 
<br>transparent and the defendant would be given a full right 
<br>of self-defense.  If convicted in the impeachment trial, 
<br>the magistrates have authority to remove the President or 
<br>senior official.  Once the President is removed, then the 
<br>constitutional succession would follow.  In this case, if a 
<br>President is legally charged, convicted, and removed, his 
<br>successor is the Vice President or what is termed the 
<br>Presidential Designate.  In the current situation in 
<br>Honduras, since the Vice President, Elvin Santos, resigned 
<br>last December in order to be able to run as the Liberal 
<br>Party Presidential candidate, President Zelaya's successor 
<br>would be Congress President Roberto Micheletti. 
<br>Unfortunately, the President was never tried, or 
<br>convicted, or was legally removed from office to allow a 
<br>legal succession. 
<br> 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br>The Legal Case Against Zelaya 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C) Zelaya's opponents allege that he violated the 
<br>Constitution on numerous grounds, some of which appear on 
<br>their face to be valid, others not: 
<br> 
<br>-- Refusing to submit a budget to the Congress: The 
<br>Constitution is unambiguous that the Executive shall submit 
<br>a proposed budget to Congress by September 15 each year 
<br>(Art. 367), that Congress shall approve the budget (Art. 
<br>366) and that no obligations or payments may be effectuated 
<br>except on the basis of an approved budget (Art. 364); 
<br> 
<br>-- Refusing to fund the Congress: Article 212 states that 
<br>the Treasury shall apportion quarterly the funds needed for 
<br>the operation of the Congress; 
<br> 
<br>-- Proposing an illegal constitutional referendum: The 
<br>Constitution may be amended only through two-thirds vote of 
<br>the Congress in two consecutive sessions (Art. 373 and 
<br>375); a constituent assembly to rewrite the constitution, 
<br>as Zelaya promoted, is therefore unconstitutional; however, 
<br>it is not clear that proposing a constituent assembly in 
<br>itself violates the constitution, only that any changes 
<br>ensuing from that assembly would be invalid; 
<br> 
<br>-- Defying the judgment of a competent court: Zelaya 
<br>insisted on pushing ahead with his constitutional reform 
<br>opinion poll after both a first-instance court and an 
<br>appeals court ordered him to suspend those efforts; 
<br>however, while he clearly intended to follow through with 
<br>the poll, he never actually did it; 
<br> 
<br>-- Proposing to reform unreformable articles: Since 
<br>Zelaya's proposed constituent assembly would have unlimited 
<br>powers to rewrite the constitution, it violated Article 
<br>374, which makes certain articles unamendable; once again, 
<br>though, Zelaya never actually attempted to change the 
<br>so-called "carved in stone" articles; it was only assumed 
<br>he intended to; 
<br> 
<br>-- Dismissing the armed forces chief: The Supreme Court's 
<br>Constitutional Hall ruled June 25 that Zelaya was in 
<br>violation of the Constitution for dismissing Defense Chief 
<br>Vasquez Velasquez; the Constitution (Art. 280) states that 
<br>the President may freely name or remove the chief of the 
<br>armed forces; but the court ruled that since Zelaya fired 
<br>him for refusing to carry out a poll the court had ruled 
<br>illegal, the firing was illegal. 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (C) Although a case could well have been made against 
<br>Zelaya for a number of the above alleged constitutional 
<br>violations, there was never any formal, public weighing of 
<br>the evidence nor any semblance of due process. 
<br> 
<br>----------------------- 
<br>The Article 239 Cannard 
<br>----------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (U) Article 239, which coup supporters began citing 
<br>after the fact to justify Zelaya's removal (it is nowhere 
<br>mentioned in the voluminous judicial dossier against 
<br>Zelaya), states that any official proposing to reform the 
<br>constitutional prohibition against reelection of the 
<br>president shall immediately cease to carry out their 
<br>functions and be ineligible to hold public office for 10 
<br>years.  Coup defenders have asserted that Zelaya therefore 
<br>automatically ceased to be President when he proposed a 
<br>constituent assembly to rewrite the Constitution. 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (C) Post's analysis indicates the Article 239 argument 
<br>is flawed on multiple grounds: 
<br> 
<br>-- Although it was widely assumed that Zelaya's reason for 
<br>seeking to convoke a constituent assembly was to amend the 
<br>constitution to allow for reelection, we are not aware 
<br>that he ever actually stated so publicly; 
<br> 
<br>-- Article 239 does not stipulate who determines whether it 
<br>has been violated or how, but it is reasonable to assume 
<br>that it does not abrogate other guarantees of due process 
<br>and the presumption of innocence; 
<br> 
<br>-- Article 94 states that no penalty shall be imposed 
<br>without the accused having been heard and found guilty in a 
<br>competent court; 
<br> 
<br>-- Many other Honduran officials, including presidents, 
<br>going back to the first elected government under the 1982 
<br>Constitution, have proposed allowing presidential 
<br>reelection, and they were never deemed to have been 
<br>automatically removed from their positions as a result. 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (C) It further warrants mention that Micheletti himself 
<br>should be forced to resign following the logic of the 239 
<br>argument, since as President of Congress he considered 
<br>legislation to have a fourth ballot box ("cuarta urna") at 
<br>the November elections to seek voter approval for a 
<br>constituent assembly to rewrite the constitution.  Any 
<br>member of Congress who discussed the proposal should also 
<br>be required to resign, and National Party presidential 
<br>candidate Pepe Lobo, who endorsed the idea, should be 
<br>ineligible to hold public office for 10 years. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- - 
<br>Forced Removal by Military was Clearly Illegal 
<br>--------------------------------------------- - 
<br> 
<br>¶14.  (C) Regardless of the merits of Zelaya's alleged 
<br>constitutional violations, it is clear from even a cursory 
<br>reading that his removal by military means was illegal, and 
<br>even the most zealous of coup defenders have been unable to 
<br>make convincing arguments to bridge the intellectual gulf 
<br>between "Zelaya broke the law" to "therefore, he was packed 
<br>off to Costa Rica by the military without a trial." 
<br> 
<br>-- Although coup supporters allege the court issued an 
<br>arrest warrant for Zelaya for disobeying its order to 
<br>desist from the opinion poll, the warrant, made public days 
<br>later, was for him to be arrested and brought before the 
<br>competent authority, not removed from the county; 
<br> 
<br>-- Even if the court had ordered Zelaya to be removed from 
<br>the country, that order would have been unconstitutional; 
<br>Article 81 states that all Hondurans have the right to 
<br>remain in the national territory, subject to certain narrow 
<br>exceptions spelled out in Article 187, which may be invoked 
<br>only by the President of the Republic with the agreement of 
<br>the Council of Ministers; Article 102 states that no 
<br>Honduran may be expatriated; 
<br> 
<br>-- The armed forces have no/no competency to execute 
<br>judicial orders; originally, Article 272 said the armed 
<br>forces had the responsibility to "maintain peace, public 
<br>order and the 'dominion' of the constitution," but that 
<br>language was excised in 1998; under the current text, only 
<br>the police are authorized to uphold the law and execute 
<br>court orders (Art. 293); 
<br> 
<br>-- Accounts of Zelaya's abduction by the military indicate 
<br>he was never legally "served" with a warrant; the soldiers 
<br>forced their way in by shooting out the locks and 
<br>essentially kidnapped the President. 
<br> 
<br>¶15. (U) The Armed Forces' ranking legal advisor, Col. 
<br>Herberth Bayardo Inestroza, acknowledged in an interview 
<br>published in the Honduran press July 5 that the Honduran 
<br>Armed Forces had broken the law in removing Zelaya from the 
<br>country.  That same day it was reported that the Public 
<br>Ministry was investigating the actions of the Armed Forces 
<br>in arresting and deporting Zelaya June 28 and that the 
<br>Supreme Court had asked the Armed Forces to explain the 
<br>circumstances that motivated his forcible exile. 
<br> 
<br>¶16. (C) As reported reftel, the legal adviser to the 
<br>Supreme Court told Poloff that at least some justices on 
<br>the Court consider Zelaya's arrest and deportation by the 
<br>military to have been illegal. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br>Congress Had no Authority to Remove Zelaya 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶17. (C) As explained above, the Constitution as amended in 
<br>2003 apparently gives sole authority for removing a 
<br>president to the judiciary.  The Congressional action of 
<br>June 28 has been reported in some media as acceptance of 
<br>Zelaya's resignation, based on a bogus resignation letter 
<br>dated June 25 that surfaced after the coup.  However, the 
<br>June 28 Congressional resolution makes no mention of the 
<br>letter, nor does it state that Congress was accepting 
<br>Zelaya's resignation.  It says Congress "disapproves" of 
<br>Zelaya's conduct and therefore "separates" him from the 
<br>office of President -- a constitutional authority Congress 
<br>does not have.  Furthermore, a source in the Congressional 
<br>leadership told us that a quorum was not present when the 
<br>resolution was adopted, rendering it invalid.  There was no 
<br>recorded vote, nor a request for the "yeas" and "nays." 
<br> 
<br>¶18. (C) In sum, for a constitutional succession from Zelaya 
<br>to Micheletti to occur would require one of several 
<br>conditions: 
<br> 
<br>Zelaya's resignation, his death, or permanent medical 
<br>incapacitation (as determined by judicial and medical 
<br>authorities), or as discussed previously, his formal criminal 
<br>conviction and removal from office.  In the absence of any of 
<br>these conditions and since Congress lacked the legal 
<br>authority to remove Zelaya, the actions of June 28 can only 
<br>be considered a coup d'etat by the legislative branch, with 
<br>the support of the judicial branch and the military, against 
<br>the executive branch.  It bears mentioning that, whereas the 
<br>resolution adopted June 28 refers only to Zelaya, its effect 
<br>was to remove the entire executive branch.  Both of these 
<br>actions clearly exceeded Congress's authority. 
<br> 
<br>------- 
<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶19. (C) The analysis of the Constitution sheds some 
<br>interesting light on the events of June 28.  The Honduran 
<br>establishment confronted a dilemma: near unanimity among 
<br>the institutions of the state and the political class that 
<br>Zelaya had abused his powers in violation of the 
<br>Constitution, but with some ambiguity what to do about it. 
<br>Faced with that lack of clarity, the military and/or 
<br>whoever ordered the coup fell back on what they knew -- the 
<br>way Honduran presidents were removed in the past: a bogus 
<br>resignation letter and a one-way ticket to a neighboring 
<br>country.  No matter what the merits of the case against 
<br>Zelaya, his forced removal by the military was clearly 
<br>illegal, and Micheletti's ascendance as "interim president" 
<br>was totally illegitimate. 
<br> 
<br>¶20. (C) Nonetheless, the very Constitutional uncertainty 
<br>that presented the political class with this dilemma may 
<br>provide the seeds for a solution.  The coup's most ardent 
<br>legal defenders have been unable to make the intellectual 
<br>leap from their arguments regarding Zelaya's alleged crimes 
<br>to how those allegations justified dragging him out of his 
<br>bed in the night and flying him to Costa Rica.  That the 
<br>Attorney General's office and the Supreme Court now 
<br>reportedly question the legality of that final step is 
<br>encouraging and may provide a face-saving "out" for the two 
<br>opposing sides in the current standoff. End Comment.
