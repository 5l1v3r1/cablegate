<br>
<br>Summary 
<br>------- 
<br>¶1. (C) Eight months before France's 2007 Presidential 
<br>election, Interior Minister Nicholas Sarkozy remains the best 
<br>positioned of the many contenders for France's presidency. 
<br>He is a markedly different presidential heavyweight, 
<br>pro-American and committed to free-market principles. 
<br>Notwithstanding his evident strengths and popularity, many 
<br>French voters are still uncomfortable with the idea of 
<br>"President Sarkozy," and questions about his hyperactive 
<br>personality, his core law-and-order agenda, and divisions 
<br>within the ruling UMP make his election far from certain. 
<br>Sarkozy's Gaullist political heritage and his likely "I can 
<br>speak frankly to the Americans" refrain mean that France and 
<br>Sarkozy would remain an independent and challenging ally. 
<br>However, a Sarkozy presidency would certainly bring a new and 
<br>welcome tone to U.S.-French relations -- and perhaps, over 
<br>time, a French approach to world problems that is less 
<br>fixated on reflexively seeking ways to distinguish France 
<br>from the U.S. Sarkozy's greatest contribution to France 
<br>could be his promise to free the country's latent economic 
<br>dynamism from the constraints of statism and labor rigidity. 
<br>End Summary. 
<br>
<br>Timeline to the Election 
<br>------------------------ 
<br>¶2. (U) Eight months ahead of the first round of France's 
<br>2007 presidential election, to be held on either Sunday, 
<br>April 15 or Sunday, April 22, 2007, Interior Minister and 
<br>President of the center-right Union for a Popular Movement 
<br>party (UMP) Nicolas Sarkozy remains the best positioned of 
<br>the many contenders. In the last presidential election in 
<br>2002, there were 16 candidates in the first round. Slightly 
<br>fewer are expected this time around. The second round 
<br>run-off between the top two vote-getters of the first round 
<br>will be held two weeks later, either Sunday, April 29 or 
<br>Sunday, May 6. Sarkozy has served as Interior Minister in 
<br>the government of Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin since 
<br>that government's inception in June 2005. In January 2007 
<br>(tentatively scheduled for January 14-15) the UMP will hold a 
<br>party congress expected to designate Sarkozy, the party 
<br>leader, as its presidential candidate. Shortly before that 
<br>congress, Sarkozy may well leave the government to dedicate 
<br>himself full-time to pursuing the presidency. In recent 
<br>weeks Sarkozy has been careful to signal that he is keeping 
<br>all his options open in this connection, pointing out that 
<br>nothing prevents him from remaining in the government while 
<br>he pursues the presidency. Sarkozy himself will make the 
<br>final decision -- and will not hesitate to ignore the advice 
<br>of others -- as he did when he chose to rejoin the government 
<br>in June 2005. 
<br>
<br>The Best Positioned Contender 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br>¶3. (C) Ever since his first tenure as interior minister 
<br>(2002 - 2004), when he emerged as a top-tier national 
<br>political figure, Sarkozy has been highly popular with a 
<br>large segment of the French electorate. The most recent 
<br>polling figures show that popularity holding steady. 
<br>Sarkozy's unchallenged control of the Union for a Popular 
<br>Movement (UMP) party (which was founded by President Chirac) 
<br>also increases his election chances. Sarkozy has worked to 
<br>turn the UMP into a formidable electoral machine, complete 
<br>with focus groups for keeping his message tuned to voters' 
<br>concerns and volunteer organizations for turning out the 
<br>Sarkozy-for-president vote. Since he became president of the 
<br>party in 2004, Sarkozy has also increased the number of party 
<br>members from 100,000 to 250,000 today. This political 
<br>organization gives Sarkozy a powerful advantage, and should 
<br>ensure his presence in the second round of the election. 
<br>Moreover, Sarkozy is a formidable campaigner, energetic, 
<br>quick on his feet and appealingly direct. The combination of 
<br>popularity, control of his party, and masterful political 
<br>skills, including as a campaigner, is unmatched by any of the 
<br>other presidential contenders. 
<br>
<br>A Different Kind of Presidential Heavyweight 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br>¶4. (C) Sarkozy is hard to pigeon-hole; he is not a 
<br>traditional French conservative, which is clear from some of 
<br>his policy proposals. Sarkozy often speaks of the need for 
<br>France to break with policies and attitudes that undercut the 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00005974 002.2 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>country's economic dynamism. Sarkozy has long called for 
<br>lower taxes and more "liberal" (i.e., free-market) economic 
<br>policies to encourage entrepreneurship. He has also long 
<br>called for a less regulated environment for big business, 
<br>something of a novelty in a country in which both left and 
<br>right have always been comfortable with a high level of 
<br>government regulation of the economy. The untested 
<br>popularity of Sarkozy's free-market orientation helps explain 
<br>why few commentators at this stage are ready to hazard a firm 
<br>prediction on the outcome of the 2007 election other than to 
<br>affirm that -- presuming candidates of the center-left and of 
<br>the center-right compete in the second round -- it will be 
<br>exceedingly close; Sarkozy himself has indicated to us on a 
<br>numerous occasions that the election will be "51 - 49." 
<br>Sarkozy is well aware of the resistance in France to 
<br>shrinking the role of the state in protecting the economic 
<br>security of both individuals and businesses. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Sarkozy's proposals in the field of social policy -- 
<br>for example, affirmative action in employment and education 
<br>for immigrants who are discriminated against, and limited 
<br>voting rights for non-citizen residents -- are not policies 
<br>traditionally associated with the right of the political 
<br>spectrum in France. Sarkozy's proposals for reforming French 
<br>government institutions -- making the president answerable to 
<br>the legislature and responsible for the domestic policies of 
<br>the government, while giving the legislature more oversight 
<br>over France's foreign policy -- also break the mold of 
<br>traditional, center-right French Gaullism. Most of all, 
<br>Sarkozy is associated with tough, firm enforcement of 
<br>anti-crime and counter-terrorism measures. 
<br>
<br>Doubts about a "President Sarkozy" 
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br>¶6. (C) Sarkozy is also perceived as a different kind of 
<br>political personality. Recent polls point to the austere De 
<br>Gaulle and the imperturbable Mitterrand as by far the most 
<br>revered of French presidents. That the edgy, intense, 
<br>hands-on Sarkozy is so far from the preferred model of 
<br>Olympian reserve raises the question of whether, as a matter 
<br>of cultural psychology, the French are ready to entrust the 
<br>presidency to Sarkozy. Clearly many French people recognize 
<br>that a "new model" is needed -- a presidency that directs and 
<br>is responsible for domestic policy, especially given the new, 
<br>shorter five-year presidential term. The iconoclastic 
<br>Sarkozy has the most extensive experience and strongest 
<br>credentials for filling that role. The French however, are 
<br>also famously hesitant to embrace change, and in a time of 
<br>apprehension and self-doubt could prefer a more traditional 
<br>and reassuring figure. Some also fear a Sarkozy presidency, 
<br>citing his "hyper-active" personality, and persisting 
<br>factional splits within his own party, and his polarizing 
<br>image as a law-and-order strongman. Electorally, Sarkozy's 
<br>law-and-order image is potentially the most significant. It 
<br>is this hard-edged profile that makes Sarkozy a divisive more 
<br>than unifying figure, generating intense allegiance on the 
<br>right and, equally strongly, unsettling so many on the left 
<br>and even the center of the political spectrum. 
<br>
<br>Pro-American at Heart, but Still a French Gaullist 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----- 
<br>¶7. (C) Sarkozy -- for a French politician -- is forceful and 
<br>unabashed about the need for France to get beyond its 
<br>anti-American reflexes. With the exception of his 
<br>reservations about the wisdom of the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 
<br>2003, Sarkozy is the French political leader most supportive 
<br>of the U.S. role in the world. Sarkozy has told the 
<br>Ambassador on several occasions that France needs to help the 
<br>U.S. "get out of Iraq." Sarkozy's pro-American orientation 
<br>has earned him the sobriquet "Sarkozy the American," and his 
<br>affinity for Americans and the U.S. is genuine and heartfelt. 
<br>Sarkozy's admiration for the U.S. comes through in one of 
<br>his favorite stories: when, as a young boy, he told father 
<br>that he wanted to be president, his father told him, "In that 
<br>case, with a name like Sarkozy, you'd better immigrate to 
<br>America." The young Nicolas replied that he wanted to become 
<br>President of France, not the U.S. Sarkozy has always wanted 
<br>to make France a land of equal opportunity for immigrants 
<br>also. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Sarkozy's pro-Americanism , however, should not be 
<br>interpreted as meaning that Gaullist insistence on France's 
<br>(and the EU's) independence from the U.S. in the 
<br>international arena will disappear. France's selective 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00005974 003 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>support for U.S. positions will continue. Nor will Sarkozy 
<br>likely abandon France's traditional preference for 
<br>strengthening the EU over NATO in the name of trans-Atlantic 
<br>rapprochement. As Sarkozy told a visiting Congressional 
<br>delegation last year, "We should never forget that we are 
<br>loyal friends -- and that friends can disagree." Although 
<br>Sarkozy feels close to America (to this day, he recalls with 
<br>fondness his "discovery" of America as an International 
<br>Visitors Program grantee in 1985), his assertive personality 
<br>is such that, as France's president, he would not shy away 
<br>from offering firm advice about how the U.S. might best 
<br>advance towards shared goals -- up to and including bald 
<br>advice to change course. Even so, what Sarkozy would call 
<br>the "loyalty" factor in his friendship toward the U.S. would 
<br>remain intact, and Sarkozy's articulate, public defense of 
<br>that attitude could, over time, result in a greater French 
<br>receptivity to America's global outlook and policy positions. 
<br>Especially if extended over a two-term, ten-year Presidency, 
<br>the result could be a France less resentful of the U.S. -- 
<br>one less reflexively inclined to taking positions that 
<br>intensify and highlight France's differences with the U.S. 
<br>
<br>Sarkozy's Free-Market Convictions Could Transform France 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
<br>¶9. (C) Sarkozy's greatest contribution to France could be in 
<br>freeing the country's latent economic dynamism from the 
<br>constraints of statism and labor rigidity. Sarkozy has, 
<br>since the beginning of his long career in politics, been 
<br>among the most outspokenly "liberal" (that is, 
<br>pro-free-market) of French political leaders. His speeches 
<br>on economic and social issues nearly invariably include 
<br>paeans to commerce, hard work, and entrepreneurship, followed 
<br>by an exhortation to Frenchmen and women to be proud of these 
<br>qualities. Sarkozy would like to make the French more 
<br>"liberal" than they are, and believes economic forces acting 
<br>on France justify his endeavor. Sarkozy often underlines the 
<br>inescapability of the global market and exhorts the French to 
<br>accept the challenges of competing in it with greater 
<br>self-confidence. He is adept at depicting, in ways that 
<br>ordinary voters understand, the drag on opportunity and 
<br>growth of a bloated state intent on monitoring nearly every 
<br>aspect of economic life. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) At the same time, Sarkozy understands that the 
<br>French want to be protected and that they are comfortable 
<br>with a high degree of state involvement in the economy. The 
<br>current controversy over the privatization and merger 
<br>involving the national gas company (GDF) and a the energy 
<br>giant Suez exemplifies the persisting sensitivity of 
<br>loosening state control over the economy in France. 
<br>Sarkozy's record -- he is above all a pragmatic politician -- 
<br>as a "liberalizing" policy practitioner is quite mixed. For 
<br>example, during his tenure as Finance Minister 
<br>(March-November 2004), when confronted by labor union 
<br>resistance to significant privatization of state utilities, 
<br>Sarkozy compromised. He worked hard -- and offered 
<br>government assistance -- to keep factories threatened with 
<br>closure operating in France. Spurred by public complaints 
<br>about rising prices in supermarkets, he negotiated 
<br>"voluntary" price controls with major chains. He practiced 
<br>"patriotic liberalism" in helping engineer the merger of a 
<br>large French pharmaceutical company (Aventis) with a larger 
<br>French pharmaceutical firm (Sanofi) rather than with Sanofi's 
<br>foreign rival (the Swiss firm, Novartis). By and large, the 
<br>public approved Sarkozy's protectionist actions. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) It remains to be seen whether economic reform will 
<br>be a decisive issue in the upcoming presidential campaign. 
<br>(Comment: If the current trend of economic growth and reduced 
<br>unemployment continues, this is less likely to be the case. 
<br>End Comment.) If it does emerge as the key campaign issue, 
<br>and if a victorious Sarkozy moves early and aggressively to 
<br>effect reform, then he could push the French past the tipping 
<br>point and into a far-reaching and necessary restructuring of 
<br>the French social model. An ambitious Sarkozy reform program 
<br>would likely include, for example, measures to further loosen 
<br>the currently mandated 35-hour workweek, measures to reduce 
<br>wealth and inheritance taxes to encourage long-term 
<br>investment in family firms, measures to restructure 
<br>unemployment and welfare benefits so they act as incentives 
<br>to find work quickly, and measures to reform the university 
<br>system so it provides students with the skills the job market 
<br>requires from them. The result could be a society in which 
<br>entrepreneurship, self-reliance and optimism would be more 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00005974 004 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>highly valued, and in which competition could co-exist with 
<br>the cherished notion of "equality." Such changes could 
<br>release the latent economic creativity and dynamism of the 
<br>French, who, by and large, are highly skilled and 
<br>hard-working. But it will be a tall order. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) In Sarkozy, who harbors a more America-like vision 
<br>for France, the moment might well meet the man, ushering in 
<br>an era of higher economic growth and innovation in France. 
<br>Such an economically re-vitalized France would cohere neatly 
<br>with Sarkozy's fundamentally Gaullist principles: renewed 
<br>economic vitality would bolster both France's ambitions to 
<br>lead in Europe and to play a major role in international 
<br>affairs.
