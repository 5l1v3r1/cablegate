<br>REF: A. BRASILIA 1784

<br>¶C. BRASILIA 1670 
<br>
<br>Classified By: POLITICAL COUNSELOR DENNIS HEARNE. REASONS: 1.4 (B)(D). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) In my first weeks in Brazil, I reached out to a 
<br>wide group of government policy makers, political leaders, 
<br>business representatives, leading journalists, and 
<br>representatives of civil society. I found a remarkable 
<br>interest in strengthening bilateral relations. I met early 
<br>on with Foreign Minister Amorim and Lula's foreign policy 
<br>advisor, Marco Aurelio Garcia, and also had highly productive 
<br>discussions with Justice Minister Bastos, Lula's Chief of 
<br>Staff for Policy Dilma Rousseff, Finance Minister Mantega, 
<br>Trade Minister Furlan, Central Bank President Meirelles, 
<br>Supreme Court President Ellen Gracie Northfleet, 
<br>congressional leaders Renan Calheiros (Senate President) and 
<br>Aldo Rebelo (Chamber of Deputies President) and former 
<br>President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, among many others. I 
<br>met with most of the CEOs of the largest U.S. and Brazilian 
<br>companies, including the media companies. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) In these meetings, there emerged a number of key 
<br>themes that I believe we must focus on going forward. 
<br>
<br>--Business and investment are on everyone's mind; 
<br>
<br>--There is a skepticism about the level of the U.S. 
<br>commitment to Brazil and South America, and a lack of 
<br>visibility in Brazil of the positive side of America -- and 
<br>what we have done and what we can do; 
<br>
<br>-- The Lula government has been tensely balanced until now 
<br>with a conservative fiscal policy on one end, and an 
<br>ideologically leftist foreign policy on the other; questions 
<br>abound as to whether this will change in a second Lula 
<br>government, and whether there are ways to shift the balance 
<br>in a promising way. (Bio-fuels may be one important tool for 
<br>doing this.) 
<br>
<br>Business and Investment 
<br>----------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) Across the range of my contacts with business, 
<br>government, and political figures, I heard one message: 
<br>There is a high degree of interest in increasing U.S. trade 
<br>and investment, expanding existing commercial relations, and 
<br>creating new public-private partnerships. This sentiment 
<br>could even be heard from Dilma Rousseff, whose ideological 
<br>history as a militant leftist would hardly suggest such an 
<br>entrepreneurial spirit (see ref A). The energy is 
<br>generalized, but often focused on specific questions of the 
<br>moment. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) A common refrain, for example, was Brazil's desire 
<br>to retain eligibility under GSP as the U.S. Congress debates 
<br>renewal of the authorizing statute. After moving our way on 
<br>copyright piracy over the past 18 months, under the threat of 
<br>USG revocation of GSP, the Brazilians now believe that it is 
<br>unfair to cast them out of the program because of unrelated 
<br>factors. I am concerned that should we proceed down that 
<br>direction, this could cast a shadow over the increasingly 
<br>positive dialogue that we are constructing, and could play 
<br>into the hands of the far left here. We need to keep 
<br>flexibility on this, as GSP can be a powerful tool in the 
<br>future. Many are also enthused about the Commercial Dialogue 
<br>that Secretary Gutierrez and the Minister of Trade initiated 
<br>in June, and the latter is seeking a return meeting with the 
<br>Secretary in October. We are also looking forward to 
<br>
<br>SIPDIS 
<br>Treasury Secretary Paulson's visit, which will hopefully 
<br>focus on more of the micro details of the Brazilian economy 
<br>
<br>BRASILIA 00001859 002 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>which Lula's government says would be their focus in a second 
<br>term. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) There is also an increase in investments between 
<br>Brazil and the U.S. with Petrobras, Embraer, steel, 
<br>construction and textiles firms all playing major roles. 
<br>The increasing importance of large industrial companies -- 
<br>both U.S. and Brazilian -- cannot be overstated. Just 
<br>recently, Lula reached out to 25 of the largest companies at 
<br>a dinner that included American companies. Large Brazilian 
<br>companies (e.g., Petrobras) are interested in IPR and 
<br>international tax treatment. In the future they will begin to 
<br>change the balance of the debate. Many large companies also 
<br>are voicing their deep concern about Venezuela's 
<br>participation in Mercosul. I believe we should be able to 
<br>leverage the concerns of these companies to effect salutary 
<br>changes in policy in a GOB that is ever more attentive to the 
<br>views of these powerful actors, the "stakeholders" in 
<br>Brazil's economy. 
<br>
<br>Skepticism and Visibility 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) There is skepticism here about the depth of U.S. 
<br>commitment to its relationship with Brazil, and to the region 
<br>as a whole. There is a related dearth of visibility on the 
<br>positive side of America, of what America has done, including 
<br>our historic concern for the common welfare and our tradition 
<br>of corporate responsibility and community service. We should 
<br>find ways to change these perceptions, focusing on specific 
<br>projects and partnerships that demonstrate our commitment and 
<br>genuine concern for Brazil's people. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) For example, we should be more engaged in Brazil's 
<br>northeast, a region of more than 50 million people, with huge 
<br>disparities in income distribution and a living standard 
<br>below that of Bolivia. In fact, this region could be the 
<br>second largest country in size and population in South 
<br>America. We need to restore and energize our AID programs and 
<br>work with our corporate community, which is already very much 
<br>engaged in corporate responsibility. A re-energized focus 
<br>through USAID on health issues - especially TB, Malaria, and 
<br>HIV-AIDS - would be one place to start, using our own direct 
<br>action and seed money, and I believe we could then bring 
<br>private sector partners in to multiply our impact. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU) Crime is a perennial concern in this violent 
<br>country and an area where we can have a significant impact. 
<br>In my meeting with Justice Minister Bastos (ref B), he asked 
<br>urgently when our Attorney General could come to Brazil, and 
<br>this presents a sterling opportunity to both address a 
<br>Brazilian plea for immediate assistance in dealing with their 
<br>public security crisis, and to establish the basis for a 
<br>regular consultative process, biannually, between our AG and 
<br>the Justice Minister. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (SBU) Indeed, I am convinced that bringing high-level USG 
<br>officials to Brazil can pave the way for dramatically 
<br>enhanced cooperation, building a top-down momentum that can 
<br>help Brazil address these critical democracy and stability 
<br>issues, while changing perceptions that we are not committed 
<br>or engaged. In addition to the AG visit, we could bring the 
<br>DEA Administrator and an expert delegation to discuss crime 
<br>and narcotrafficking. In fact, the Governor of Sao Paulo and 
<br>the Mayor of Rio are also requesting high visibility visits 
<br>from law enforcement officials. It is also important to 
<br>maintain a regular schedule for our existing bilateral 
<br>meetings, such as our P level political talks. U.S. Supreme 
<br>Court Justices could bring their perspectives to Brazilian 
<br>counterparts grappling with judicial reform. 
<br>
<br>Balancing Acts - Ideology, Pragmatism and Democracy 
<br>
<br>BRASILIA 00001859 003 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) The conservative and pragmatic fiscal policy pursued 
<br>successfully by Lula has been in tense balance with a foreign 
<br>policy that is ideologically-skewed to the left, in 
<br>strategic, trade and commercial issues. The south-south 
<br>orientation that saw Brazil clumsily declare China a market 
<br>economy, fumble its campaign for a permanent UNSC seat, and 
<br>embark on dubious efforts to strengthen economic ties with 
<br>Arab states and other marginal players at the expense of 
<br>traditional relations with the U.S. and Europe, has 
<br>established a foreign policy record that is tough to defend 
<br>against attacks in the opposition and the media. There is 
<br>some concern that Lula and his Amorim-led foreign policy team 
<br>could, in a second term, radicalize Brazil's foreign policy 
<br>further away from interests and partnerships that can best 
<br>serve Brazil and our bilateral relationship. I believe we 
<br>can help to diminish this risk by taking a practical approach 
<br>that draws Brazil into collaboration with us in areas that 
<br>clearly hold promise for both countries, such as energy and 
<br>law enforcement. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (SBU) We need to get away from ideological labels and 
<br>find common ground. A superb means for doing this is 
<br>cooperation on bio-fuels. The Brazilians' view that 
<br>bio-fuels represent a transformational technology in which 
<br>they are global leaders is one we should embrace and use as 
<br>the basis for cooperation on a strategic level. It is very 
<br>evident to me that in research and development, in 
<br>elaboration of poverty alleviation initiatives for third 
<br>countries, and in building new multilateral fora for policy 
<br>discussions, we have the potential to work closely with the 
<br>Brazilians in bio-fuels. They want this, we want it, and it 
<br>can potentially serve as a vehicle for improving bilateral 
<br>relations across the board without any ideological 
<br>considerations. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (SBU) There is a broad consensus that Brazil must 
<br>continue to strengthen its already robust democracy, and, in 
<br>the words of Presidential advisor Marco Aurelio Garcia, 
<br>"bring the benefits of democracy to our poorest citizens." 
<br>The sentiment is universal; however, the initial reaction to 
<br>Dr. Krasner's trip clearly illustrates the concerns of Brazil 
<br>of being too aligned with American foreign policy interest 
<br>(ref c). As Itamaraty Under Secretary for Political Affairs 
<br>Antonio de Aguiar Patriota related to me: Brazil does not 
<br>want to be stereotyped as being in "Our Camp." I think that a 
<br>follow up trip, perhaps by Under Secretary Paula Dobriansky, 
<br>that revisits the democratic governance issue will be more 
<br>successful, if it is not perceived as exclusively an American 
<br>policy initiative. We need to get away from labels that are 
<br>seen as ideological, such as FTAA. What we need to do is 
<br>progress incrementally, without labels, perhaps taking a 
<br>slower approach that will eventually achieve our foreign 
<br>policy objectives. 
<br>
<br>A Legacy and a Future 
<br>--------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶13. (SBU) Lula in a second term (should he win one) will be 
<br>thinking of his legacy, his opponents will be looking toward 
<br>the future, but most Brazilians seem to want many of the same 
<br>things. It was interesting to talk to former President 
<br>Fernando Henrique Cardoso about his interest in a grand 
<br>coalition. President Lula clearly has an ability to build 
<br>upon his economic achievements and perhaps redefine his 
<br>government in a possible second term, without the need to 
<br>balance it with a strongly ideological foreign policy. We 
<br>cannot tell Brazilians how to shape their legacy and future, 
<br>how to build up their democracy or bring in more investment 
<br>or institute vital reforms, but we can offer our own 
<br>experiences in relevant areas, and continue to press the 
<br>
<br>BRASILIA 00001859 004 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>message that their ability to build the prosperity they seek 
<br>rides on achieving these changes. There are ways we can 
<br>help, and in so doing, we also will bolster the bilateral 
<br>relationship and our own vital interests.
