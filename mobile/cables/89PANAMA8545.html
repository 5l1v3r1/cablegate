<br>-- NORIEGA PLANS FOR A NEW YEAR IN POWER 
<br>
<br>¶1. SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. 
<br>
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>SUMMARY 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>¶2. THROUGHOUT 1989, RAPIDLY UNFOLDING POLITICAL 
<br>DEVELOPMENTS HELD OUT HOPE TO MANY PANAMANIANS FOR 
<br>A RESOLUTION TO PANAMA’S POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC 
<br>CRISIS: THE ELECTION OF MAY 7, THE SUBSEQUENT OAS 
<br>NEGOTIATIONS, THE CONSTITUTIONAL DEADLINE OF 
<br>SEPTEMBER 1, THE COUP ATTEMPT OF OCTOBER 3, AND 
<br>THE TREATY DEADLINE OF JANUARY 1, 1990. 
<br>PROJECTING INTO THE FIRST HALF OF 1990, NO SUCH 
<br>HOPEFUL EVENTS AND DATES ARE READILY APPARENT. 
<br>THE OPPOSITION’S MAIN OBJECTIVE WILL BE TO SURVIVE 
<br>POLITICALLY, ECONOMICALLY, AND LITERALLY UNTIL THE 
<br>NEXT COUP. NORIEGA WILL HAVE TO TRY AND 
<br>CONSOLIDATE HIS CONTROL OVER THE PANAMA DEFENSE 
<br>FORCES (FDP) AND AVOID ANOTHER UPRISING. 
<br>
<br>¶3. PRESSURES ON NORIEGA HAVE INCREASED ACROSS THE 
<br>BOARD, BUT HE SEEMS TO HAVE DETERMINED THAT HE CAN 
<br>MANAGE THEM. DESPITE NEW U.S. ECONOMIC SANCTIONS, 
<br>THE MOST PRECIPITOUS ECONOMIC DROP IS OVER FOR 
<br>NOW, FOLLOWING A TWO-YEAR, 25 PERCENT DROP IN 
<br>GDP. INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION REMAINS AN IRRITANT 
<br>TO THE REGIME, BUT IT IS NOT A SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR 
<br>NORIEGA’S STABILITY. U.S. ACTIONS, FROM THE 
<br>APPOINTMENT OF AN ACTING CANAL ADMINISTRATOR TO 
<br>RUMORED COVERT PLANS AGAINST NORIEGA AS WELL AS 
<br>NEW ECONOMIC SANCTIONS, ALLOW NORIEGA TO BEAT THE 
<br>NATIONALISTIC DRUM AND MAKE IT APPEAR AS IF 
<br>DOMESTIC SUPPORT FOR HIM IS GROWING. 
<br>
<br>¶4. NORIEGA’S WEAKEST POINT REMAINS HIS OWN 
<br>INSTITUTION. WHISPERS THAT “THE OCTOBER 3 COUP IS 
<br>NOT OVER” CONTINUE AND NORIEGA CONTINUES TO HOLD 
<br>ON MAINLY BY BRUTAL REPRESSION OF ANY POTENTIAL 
<br>NEW INSIDE OPPONENTS. WHEN ANOTHER ACTION TO 
<br>REMOVE NORIEGA WILL TAKE PLACE IS UNCERTAIN, BUT 
<br>WAITING FOR THAT POSSIBILITY IS THE MAIN PROSPECT 
<br>FOR PANAMA IN 1990. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br>THE CRISIS GRINDS ON 
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br>¶5. THE PANAMA CRISIS CONTINUES TO GRIND ON WITH 
<br>NO CLEAR END IN SIGHT. NORIEGA TENACIOUSLY HOLDS 
<br>ON TO POWER, INTIMIDATING HIS OPPONENTS AND FIRING 
<br>UP HIS SUPPORTERS WITH SLOGANS CALLING FOR 
<br>RETRIBUTION AGAINST “PANAMANIAN TRAITORS AND THEIR 
<br>U.S. MASTERS,” SHOULD ANYTHING HAPPEN TO HIM. 
<br>NORIEGA IS WEAKER THAN HE WAS AT THIS TIME LAST 
<br>YEAR, BUT THE IMPACT OF THE CURRENT SET OF 
<br>PRESSURES HAVE SO FAR FAILED TO EJECT HIM FROM 
<br>OFFICE. 
<br>
<br>¶6. NEVERTHELESS, RECENT PRESS REPORTS OF AN 
<br>ALLEGED U.S. COVERT ACTION PLAN AGAINST NORIEGA 
<br>HAVE ONCE AGAIN RAISED HOPES OF SOME PANAMANIANS 
<br>THAT THIS MAY BE THE BEGINNING OF HIS END. 
<br>NORIEGA HIMSELF IS APPARENTLY ATTACHING SOME 
<br>CREDIBILITY TO THE PRESS REPORTS. HE HAS REACTED 
<br>NERVOUSLY BY STEPPING UP HARASSMENT OF THE 
<br>OPPOSITION AND INCREASING THE SIZE, TRAINING, 
<br>ACTIVITY, AND ARMAMENT OF HIS “DIGNITY 
<br>BATTALIONS.” THE OPPOSITION LEADERSHIP IS 
<br>CONCERNED OVER THE NEW “EYE FOR AN EYE” 
<br>PARA-MILITARY CAMPAIGN, WHICH NORIEGA HAS USED TO 
<br>REMIND THE OPPOSITION OF ITS VULNERABILITY. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br>REGIME POLITICAL ACTIVITY 
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br>¶7. THE RODRIGUEZ ADMINISTRATION, UNSURPRISINGLY, 
<br>REMAINS INEFFECTUAL, BUT CONTINUES TO LIMP ALONG. 
<br>REGIME SOURCES INDICATE WITH SOME DEGREE OF 
<br>CERTITUDE THAT NORIEGA IS UNHAPPY WITH HIS 
<br>CIVILIAN PUPPETS, THAT HE MAY EVEN FIRE RODRIGUEZ, 
<br>AND PLANS TO TAKE OVER THE FORMAL REIGNS OF 
<br>GOVERNMENT SOON. THE ASSEMBLY OF 510 LOCAL 
<br>DISTRICT REPRESENTATIVES (ANRC) CONFIRMED HIM AS 
<br>”NATIONAL COORDINATOR” ON NOVEMBER 22. THIS 
<br>BRINGS HIM ONE STEP CLOSER TO BEING NAMED “HEAD OF 
<br>GOVERNMENT”, WHICH HE AND OTHERS AROUND HIM HAVE 
<br>HINTED AT FOR SOME TIME. 
<br>
<br>¶8. MANY VIEW THIS NORIEGA MOVE AS THE FINAL STEP 
<br>TOWARD A TOTALITARIAN REGIME AND FURTHER SEVERE 
<br>REPRESSION. SOME SEE THIS AS A PENDING NORIEGA 
<br>MISTAKE. AS “HEAD OF GOVERNMENT”, HE WOULD HAVE 
<br>TO BEAR FULL OFFICIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR REGIME 
<br>ACTIONS. AT THE SAME TIME, BY INTRODUCING A NEW 
<br>ELEMENT -- HIS GOVERNMENTAL ROLE -- INTO THE STALE 
<br>POLITICAL SITUATION, NORIEGA MAY BE ABLE TO USE 
<br>HIS USUAL MIXTURE OF OBFUSCATION AND INTIMIDATION 
<br>TO BUY HIMSELF MORE TIME AND POLITICAL BREATHING 
<br>SPACE. 
<br>
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br>THE OPPOSITION 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br>¶9. NORIEGA’S MOST RECENT PARA-MILITARY SHOW OF 
<br>FORCE FURTHER CONVINCED THE OPPOSITION THAT 
<br>POLITICAL ACTION WILL RESULT ONLY IN GREATER 
<br>REGIME BRUTALITY AGAINST THEM, NOT NORIEGA’S 
<br>DEPARTURE. THE OPPOSITION LEADERSHIP QUIETLY 
<br>HOPES THAT CLANDESTINE (AND OTHER) U.S. ACTION, 
<br>POSSIBLY COUPLED WITH ANOTHER COUP WILL REMOVE 
<br>NORIEGA. THE LEADERS SEE THEMSELVES PLAYING A 
<br>ROLE IN THE NEXT COUP ATTEMPT AND THEIR CURRENT 
<br>PREPARATIONS ARE FOCUSED ON BEING ABLE TO MOVE IN 
<br>TO FILL THE GOVERNMENT VACUUM IF THE NEXT EFFORT 
<br>SHOULD SUCCEED. THE CIVILIAN OPPOSITION 
<br>RECOGNIZES THE POLITICAL REALITY THAT THE MILITARY 
<br>IS THE MAIN POLITICAL FORCE IN PANAMA. 
<br>
<br>¶10. AS THE MEMORY -- AND TO SOME EXTENT THE 
<br>LEGITIMACY -- OF THE MAY ELECTION RECEDES, THE 
<br>PRESSURE ON THE LEADERSHIP FROM WITHIN THE 
<br>OPPOSITION RANKS “TO DO SOMETHING” TO MAINTAIN 
<br>POLITICAL LEGITIMACY IS GROWING, HOWEVER. 
<br>OPPOSITION ABILITY TO CULTIVATE POLITICAL SUPPORT 
<br>AND TRUST IN THE ADOC LEADERSHIP ARE HAMPERED BY 
<br>EFFECTIVE NORIEGA INTIMIDATION AT THE GRASS ROOTS 
<br>LEVEL. MEANWHILE, U.S. ECONOMIC SANCTIONS ARE 
<br>CONTINUING TO HURT AND NEW MEASURES ARE 
<br>UNPOPULAR. THE OPPOSITION LEADERSHIP FEARS THAT 
<br>MANY PANAMANIANS -- INCLUDING THEIR FOLLOWERS -- 
<br>WILL INCREASINGLY DEMAND THAT THE AMERICANS GET 
<br>OFF THEIR BACKS, IF NORIEGA WON’T. 
<br>
<br>¶11. PANAMA’S OPPOSITION AND PANAMANIANS IN 
<br>GENERAL RAN UP MANY SHORT TERM HILLS IN 1989 - 
<br>WITH THE END ALWAYS JUST OVER THE HORIZON. MAY 
<br>ELECTIONS, THE OAS NEGOTIATIONS, SEPTEMBER 1, 
<br>OCTOBER 3, AND NOW JANUARY 1, 1990 HAVE ALL TOO 
<br>EASILY BEEN ACCEPTED AS TARGETS FOR WHEN THE 
<br>PANAMA CRISIS WOULD “HAVE TO” BE SOLVED. ALREADY 
<br>ADOC LEADER GUILLERMO “BILLY” FORD IS TALKING OF 
<br>FEBRUARY 25 (NICARAGUAN ELECTION DAY) AS A DATE 
<br>BEFORE WHICH NORIEGA MUST FALL IF THE U.S. DOES 
<br>NOT WISH TO HAVE THE PRECEDENT OF AN ANNULLED 
<br>ELECTION REPEATED IN NICARAGUA . OVERALL, 
<br>HOWEVER, THE OPPOSITION HAS LITTLE ENERGY LEFT TO 
<br>CHARGE UP ANOTHER HILL UNLESS CONVINCED IT IS THE 
<br>LAST ONE. ONLY ANOTHER COUP HOLDS OUT SUCH A 
<br>PROMISE, BUT THE OPPOSITION IS NOT ABLE TO 
<br>INFLUENCE THAT TO ANY SIGNIFICANT DEGREE. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br>THE NEXT COUP ATTEMPT 
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br>¶12. THE MOST (AND MAYBE ONLY) HOPEFUL SIGN FOR 
<br>NORIEGA’S OPPONENTS IN 1990 IS THAT TROUBLES 
<br>INSIDE THE FDP ARE WORSE THAN THEY HAVE EVER 
<br>BEEN. REASSIGNMENTS AND PROMOTIONS FLOWING FROM 
<br>THE POST-COUP PURGE ARE JUST NOW BEING MADE -- 
<br>MORE THAN TWO MONTHS AFTER THE EVENT. MANY OF THE 
<br>MORE “PROFESSIONAL” FDP OFFICERS AND NCO’S WERE 
<br>KILLED, TORTURED, OR DISMISSED AFTER OCTOBER 3. 
<br>THE SUCCESSOR CROP OF TRUE BELIEVERS HAS NEITHER 
<br>THE EXPERIENCE, TRAINING OR INTELLIGENCE TO FILL 
<br>THE SHOES OF THEIR PREDECESSORS. NORIEGA HAS HAD 
<br>TO RELY MAINLY ON HIMSELF OR THE SUPPORT OF THIS 
<br>SMALL CLIQUE OF LOYALISTS SINCE THE COUP ATTEMPT. 
<br>HIS INCREASED USE OF DIGNITY BATTALIONS IS ALSO 
<br>WEARING ON THE CAREER SOLDIERS. WHAT LITTLE 
<br>MILITARY PRIDE THEY HAVE LEFT HAS BEEN INJURED BY 
<br>THE ACTIVITIES OF THIS PARA-MILITARY RABBLE WHICH 
<br>THEY FEAR WILL GET OUT OF CONTROL AND ULTIMATELY 
<br>HURT THE INSTITUTION. WITH THE DIGNITY BATTALIONS 
<br>AND OTHER IRREGULARS OVER 2000 IN NUMBER THE IMAGE 
<br>OF A COMPETING PARA-MILITARY FORCE IS BEGINNING TO 
<br>ARISE. 
<br>
<br>¶13. DISCONTENT AND FEELINGS OF REVENGE CONTINUE 
<br>TO FESTER INSIDE THE FDP AND THERE ARE NUMEROUS 
<br>REPORTS THAT THERE ARE “INDIVIDUALS” WHO ARE 
<br>PREPARED TO ACT ON THESE EMOTIONS. ONE REGIME 
<br>INSIDER RECENTLY CLAIMED THAT NORIEGA’S NOMINAL 
<br>NUMBER 2, COLONEL MARCO JUSTINES, IS HIMSELF 
<br>LOOKING FOR WAYS TO INCH OUT HIS BOSS. MEANWHILE, 
<br>NOTORIOUS CIVILIAN SUPPORTERS OF NORIEGA, SUCH AS 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXXXX(STRICTLY PROTECT), 
<br>ARE ALREADY LOOKING BEYOND NORIEGA’S DEPARTURE IN 
<br>ADVOCATING WITH EMBOFFS AN OPPOSITION DECLARATION 
<br>OF AMNESTY FOR REGIME SUPPORTERS. SOURCES NOW 
<br>INDICATE THAT NORIEGA SUSPECTS ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO 
<br>UNSEAT HIM AS EARLY AS DECEMBER 15. 
<br>
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br>THE STATUS OF “UNRELENTING PRESSURES” 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>INTERNATIONAL 
<br>------------- 
<br>¶14. THE RECENT RESOLUTION OF THE OASGA CONFIRMED 
<br>NORIEGA’S ISOLATION IN THE HEMISPHERE, BUT WAS MET 
<br>WITH ONLY FLEETING INTEREST IN PANAMA. THE FDP’S 
<br>DISINVITATION TO THE RECENT CONFERENCE OF THE 
<br>AMERICAN ARMIES IN GUATEMALA WAS POTENTIALLY A 
<br>MORE SERIOUS BLOW TO FDP MORALE, BUT THIS COLD 
<br>SHOULDER FROM THEIR LATIN COLLEAGUES PASSED 
<br>LARGELY UNNOTICED BECAUSE OF NORIEGA’S ABSOLUTE 
<br>CONTROL OF INFORMATION INSIDE AND OUTSIDE HIS 
<br>INSTITUTION. 
<br>
<br>¶15. AMBASSADORS OF MOST NATIONS REMAIN OUTSIDE 
<br>PANAMA, EITHER ON VACATION OR CONSULTATIONS, BUT 
<br>LOCAL DIPLOMATIC ISOLATION MAY BE IN DANGER. THE 
<br>FRENCH AMBASSADOR RECENTLY RETURNED FROM HIS 
<br>”VACATION” TO REJOIN HIS ITALIAN AND SPANISH 
<br>COLLEAGUES WHO NEVER LEFT. SEVERAL AMBASSADORS 
<br>AND MILITARY ATTACHES (E.G. MEXICO) MAY VISIT 
<br>THEIR FAMILIES WHICH ARE RESIDING HERE AT 
<br>CHRISTMAS. NORIEGA IS MAKING ALL HE CAN OUT OF 
<br>CONTACTS WITH THE USSR, THE PRC, LIBYA, CUBA, 
<br>NICARAGUA, AND EVEN U.S. ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT 
<br>GROUPS. HE WILL ALSO SEEK TO CONJURE UP SOME 
<br>LIMITED LEGITIMACY IN HIS PLEA FOR LATIN 
<br>SOLIDARITY OVER THE CANAL ADMINISTRATOR ISSUE. 
<br>
<br>ECONOMIC 
<br>-------- 
<br>¶16. THE REGIME CONTINUES TO HAVE CASH FLOW 
<br>PROBLEMS, BUT THE ECONOMIC DOWNWARD SPIRAL HAS 
<br>LEVELED OFF FOR NOW. NORIEGA IS ABLE TO COMBAT 
<br>THE WORST DISRUPTIONS BY SALARY ADJUSTMENTS AND 
<br>CONTINUED GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT OF LOYALISTS. 
<br>UNEMPLOYMENT OVERALL IS ON THE RISE, BUT ONE OF 
<br>THE “PILLARS” OF THE PANAMANIAN SERVICE ECONOMY -- 
<br>THE COLON FREE ZONE -- IS HAVING RECORD SALES AND 
<br>PROVIDES SOMEWHAT INCREASING EMPLOYMENT IN THE 
<br>POLITICALLY VOLATILE COLON AREA. 
<br>
<br>¶17. MEANWHILE, PARA-MILITARY DIGNITY BATTALIONS 
<br>ARE ENLISTING OR SCARING THE UNEMPLOYED. 
<br>BUSINESSMEN, HURT BY NORIEGA AND U.S. SANCTIONS, 
<br>ARE INCREASINGLY MORE LIKELY TO MOVE TOWARD 
<br>ACCOMMODATION WITH NORIEGA. MANY FEEL THEY HAVE 
<br>TO GIVE PRIORITY TO BEING ABLE TO STAY IN BUSINESS. 
<br>
<br>U.S. PRESSURES 
<br>-------------- 
<br>¶18. FURTHER U.S. ECONOMIC SANCTIONS HEIGHTEN THE 
<br>SENSE OF CRISIS IN PANAMA, CREATING THE PARADOX OF 
<br>REGIME-OPPOSITION-CHURCH AGREEMENT IN OPPOSING 
<br>THEM. THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE U.S. PORT BAN FOR 
<br>PANAMANIAN FLAGGED VESSELS AND THE APPOINTMENT OF 
<br>A TEMPORARY CANAL ADMINISTRATOR CREATE NEW 
<br>PROBLEMS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR NORIEGA. BANNING 
<br>PANAMANIAN FLAGGED VESSELS FROM THE U.S. WILL ROB 
<br>NORIEGA AND HIS CRONIES OF A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT 
<br>OF INCOME. SOME OF THE LATTER MAY EVEN JUMP SHIP 
<br>AND TURN ON HIM. BUT IN THE END RESULT, MANY MORE 
<br>MAY REALIZE THAT IT WAS THEY WHO DEPENDED ON HIM, 
<br>NOT HE ON THEM. 
<br>
<br>¶19. THE CANAL ADMINISTRATOR APPOINTMENT OFFERS 
<br>NORIEGA SOME ADDITIONAL NATIONALISTIC PEGS TO 
<br>SUPPORT HIS SEARCH FOR DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL 
<br>SUPPORT. BLOWING THE TREATY VIOLATION AND 
<br>NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY WHISTLE MAY WELL GAIN HIM 
<br>SOME SUPPORT. PLAYED WELL, HE MAY AGAIN BE ABLE 
<br>TO DO WHAT HE DOES BEST: BUY TIME. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br>THE FUTURE OF THE PANAMA CRISIS 
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br>¶20. DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN OPPOSITION TO NORIEGA IS 
<br>SHOWING SIGNS OF FATIGUE. FOREIGN ATTENTION IN 
<br>PARTICULAR IS DISTRACTED BY MUCH HIGHER PROFILE 
<br>REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL EVENTS, FROM EL 
<br>SALVADOR TO BERLIN. OF COURSE, NORIEGA TOO IS 
<br>TIRING, EXEMPLIFIED IN HIS SLOWNESS IN SETTLING 
<br>THE TURMOIL INSIDE HIS OWN INSTITUTION. BUT HE IS 
<br>A MASTER OF SURVIVAL AND ABLE TO BUILD ON THE 
<br>FATIGUE OF OTHERS. RENEWED NOISES IN RECENT 
<br>REGIME PRONOUNCEMENTS OF A WILLINGNESS TO “TALK” 
<br>ARE A CLASSIC MANIFESTATION OF TRIED AND TRUE 
<br>NORIEGA TIME-BUYING TACTICS. 
<br>
<br>¶21. THE POLITICAL TENSION IN PANAMA, INCREASED BY 
<br>RECENT PRESS REVELATIONS AND U.S. SANCTIONS 
<br>ANNOUNCEMENTS, WILL LIKELY EBB IN EARLY 1990, 
<br>ABSENT SOME MAJOR EVENT. NORIEGA IS SHOWING NO 
<br>SIGNS THAT HE HAS ANY INTENTION OF LEAVING 
<br>VOLUNTARILY. GIVEN BROAD POLITICAL REALITIES IN 
<br>THIS COUNTRY, THE ONLY HOPE FOR A FIRST STEP IN 
<br>CRISIS RESOLUTION IS ANOTHER COUP. WAITING FOR 
<br>THAT TO HAPPEN IS THE MAIN POLITICAL PROSPECT FOR 
<br>PANAMA IN 1990.
