<br>========================= 
<br>U.S.-SPAIN RELATIONS 
<br>========================= 
<br>¶23. (C) On bilateral relations, Zapatero said he would never 
<br>ask the USG to do something it could not do and, in turn, did 
<br>not want to be asked to do something he did not believe in. 
<br>Zapatero said he understood President Bush was upset with his 
<br>decision to withdraw Spanish forces from Iraq, but insisted 
<br>that he had maintained a consistent position on Iraq, made 
<br>clear this position in the election campaign, and said he had 
<br>followed his convictions and commitments in carrying out the 
<br>withdrawal.  He said he was not bothered by Washington's 
<br>reaction; he could understand the President's perspective. 
<br> 
<br>¶24. (C) Zapatero regretted not having engaged with the U.S. 
<br>prior to winning the 2004 election, but it wasn't because he 
<br>wasn't available.  Zapatero complained that U.S. visitors to 
<br>Spain did not seek him out during his four years as 
<br>opposition leader.  The lack of contact was ironic since, the 
<br>State Department had sponsored his 1990 participation in a 
<br>group of young leaders who traveled to the U.S. as 
<br>International Visitor grantees.  Zapatero said this was a 
<br>good trip.  He learned then and subsequently that the U.S. 
<br>was a great country with great successes, which sometimes 
<br>also "created great problems." 
<br> 
<br>¶25. (C) Zapatero said he was aware that there would always be 
<br>some hesitation on the part of the USG regarding his 
<br>government, but also said he understood that "nothing is more 
<br>important than deeds."   He pointed to Afghanistan as one 
<br>demonstration of Spain's commitment to support the United 
<br>States when our values coincide.  Spain would remain in 
<br>Afghanistan as long as necessary to meet its commitment.
