<br>SUBJECT: INTEL'S CRYPTO IMPORTATION WAIVER: LESS THAN A
<br>BREAKTHROUGH
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador John Beyrle, Reasons 1.4 b&d.
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary:  Intel representatives recently briefed us on
<br>the waiver it received to import 1,000 encrypted platforms
<br>for the development of software.  Intel was able to by-pass
<br>the cumbersome licensing process by engaging in high-level
<br>lobbying and capitalizing on Russia's desire to become a
<br>"knowledge-based" economy.  Contrary to recent Russian
<br>statements, this waiver does not appear to represent a
<br>breakthrough in the importation of commercial products with
<br>cryptographic content.  Russia continues to operate under the
<br>old regulations; proposed new regulations do not meet the
<br>terms of the 2006 U.S.- Russia side agreement on
<br>cryptography.  End Summary.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) On October 28 Emboffs met with XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX to discuss Intel's recent waiver on importing
<br>cryptographic goods.  Intel believes this breakthrough is one
<br>that other IT companies could piggy-back on.  XXXXXXXXXXXX stated
<br>that the waiver allows Intel to import 1,000 development kits
<br>containing encrypted platforms necessary to design and
<br>develop software.  The waiver allows the importation without
<br>the required laboratory analysis and approval by the Federal
<br>Security Bureau (FSB).  However, the waiver allows only 1,000
<br>units to be imported; if Intel needs to import more, they
<br>need to request a new waiver.  The waiver applies to only one
<br>specific customs code (item), with no variations.  As well,
<br>these cryptographic items can only be used in R&D; they
<br>cannot appear on the commercial market.  Once Intel is
<br>finished with the platforms they must be submitted to a
<br>designated state-run industrial waste disposal company for
<br>their destruction.
<br>
<br>----------
<br>Background
<br>----------
<br>¶3. (C) In 2006 Russia signed a side agreement to its WTO
<br>bilateral Working Party Agreement with the U.S. in which
<br>Russia agreed to streamline and simplify its procedures for
<br>the importation of items containing cryptographic
<br>information.  Nearly three years later, progress in meeting
<br>the terms of this agreement has been slow and its results
<br>minimal.  Russia's proposed new regulations do not meet the
<br>terms laid out in the side agreement or in WTO regulations.
<br>To date, companies still must follow the existing cumbersome
<br>rules in applying for permission to import items containing
<br>any level of cryptographic information, including cell
<br>phones.  This permission request usually involves submitting
<br>samples of the item to an FSB approved laboratory for
<br>analysis, raising concerns about the violation of
<br>intellectual property through reverse engineering.  So far,
<br>U.S. firms have not voiced major concern over this last
<br>issue; rather, their focus has been on the time consuming
<br>process for the importation of crypto-related products.
<br>Current procedures take six months to complete and must be
<br>done for each shipment.
<br>
<br>------------------------------
<br>What It Took to Get the Waiver
<br>------------------------------
<br>¶4. (C) In order to get the waiver, Intel capitalized on the
<br>GOR's desire to develop Russia as a knowledge-based economy.
<br>Several high-level Intel officers, including CEO Craig
<br>Barrett, and other officials, such as American Chamber of
<br>Commerce President Andrew Somers, highlighted to their GOR
<br>interlocutors, including President Medvedev, the role Intel
<br>plays in employing over 1,000 Russian engineers.  Intel's
<br>advocates emphasized that if Intel could not quickly import
<br>these development kits, there would be no programming work
<br>available and Intel would have to lay off over 200 engineers.
<br>In addition, R&D work in Russia would have to move to India
<br>or China.  This high-level lobbying secured Intel a meeting
<br>with key FSB officials to explain its needs.  Intel was able
<br>to demonstrate the reasonableness of its request and, as a
<br>result, by-passed the current extensive licensing
<br>requirement.
<br>
<br>----------------------------------------
<br>But It Does Not Solve the Crypto Problem
<br>----------------------------------------
<br>¶5. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX highlighted however, that this breakthrough
<br>does not apply to Intel's commercial products.  He stated
<br>that Intel is currently evaluating options for approaching
<br>
<br>MOSCOW 00002723  002 OF 002
<br>
<br>the GOR on how to expedite importation of cryptographic
<br>commercial products, a significant source of Intel's sales
<br>revenue.  The procedures that Russia agreed to change in 2006
<br>remain in place three years later.  Recently proposed new
<br>regulations do not appear to significantly reduce the need to
<br>apply for permission for each shipment of goods with
<br>cryptographic components.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) During a July visit, USTR Russia and Eurasia Director
<br>Elizabeth Hafner raised concerns with the FSB and the
<br>Ministry of Economic Development (MED), that the proposed new
<br>regulations, if implemented without revision, would set up
<br>Russia to be in violation of WTO regulations from the moment
<br>of its accession.  MED understood the situation, but felt
<br>that it might be more effective to implement the new
<br>procedures, see where there are problems and fix them as they
<br>appear.  To date, we have not seen a more recent version of
<br>the proposed new regulations for the importation of
<br>cryptographic goods to see if the FSB took USG comments under
<br>advisement.
<br>
<br>-------
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>¶7. (C) During several recent high-level meetings between U.S.
<br>and Russian interlocutors, the Russians have highlighted the
<br>Intel waiver as a major breakthrough in Russia's trade regime
<br>dealing with cryptographic goods, and thus a step forward on
<br>their WTO to-do list.  The information from Intel, however,
<br>indicates this is a specific, limited waiver only for use in
<br>R&D.  While this does demonstrate some limited flexibility on
<br>the part of the FSB - and thus a step forward ), whether
<br>other U.S. companies can receive similar waivers remains to
<br>be seen.  Additional GOR actions will be required to
<br>streamline Russia's procedures for the importation of
<br>cryptographic goods for commercial sale.  Russia continues to
<br>lag in the timetables and provisions it agreed to in the 2006
<br>side-agreement on cryptology.  Embassy will follow-up with
<br>the FSB and MED officials, to urge implementation of the 2006
<br>side-agreement, especially with regard to commercial goods.
