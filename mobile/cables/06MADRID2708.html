<br>SIPDIS

<br>Argentina, what it would mean if Raul Castro represents Cuba
<br>at the Summit, Venezuela's loss of support among its
<br>neighbors, Brazilian President Lula, and Mexico's problems.
<br>END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>-- The Iberoamerican Summit --
<br>
<br>¶2. (C/NF) Over breakfast at the Ambassador's residence on
<br>October 17, Iglesias told the Ambassador and DCM that his
<br>first year as Iberoamerican Secretary General has been busy.
<br>Now it is even busier as he and the Secretariat staff prepare
<br>for the Summit in Montevideo on November 4-5. He lauded the
<br>high level of attention that Spain lavishes on this forum,
<br>noting that the King, President Zapatero, and new MFA
<br>Secretary of State for Latin America Trinidad Jimenez will
<br>
<br>SIPDIS
<br>lead a big Spanish delegation to Montevideo. He also said
<br>that Spain was giving the Secretariat good support, including
<br>a staff of 25. Iglesias said that Spain wants this forum,
<br>where it is a big player and everyone is together at the
<br>table, to be successful. He said that the annual summit
<br>might seem like overkill but is an important way to tie
<br>together the many activities that go on throughout the year.
<br>While Uruguay is working hard on the Summit preparations,
<br>Iglesias said, it is going to be a complex event that will
<br>test the host. Not only is Uruguay itself facing particularly
<br>difficult relations with Argentina, but there are fires
<br>burning all over Latin America.
<br>
<br>-- Uruguay --
<br>
<br>¶3. (C/NF) Speaking as an Uruguayan, Iglesias said that
<br>Uruguay feels besieged by Argentina. He lamented that the
<br>Entre Rios border crossing is closed again, and asked how
<br>Mexicans would feel if the US closed the US-Mexico border.
<br>Iglesias said that Argentine President Kirchner is being
<br>overly aggressive and has become the most hated man in
<br>Uruguay. With Brazilian President Lula no longer being
<br>helpful in resolving the dispute and Kirchner the source of
<br>the problem, a fairly leftist Uruguayan government is being
<br>driven towards the US, with which it is keen to deepen trade
<br>ties.
<br>
<br>-- Cuba --
<br>
<br>¶4. (C/NF) On Cuba, Iglesias said that he has heard that Raul
<br>Castro might represent Cuba at the Montevideo Summit, but
<br>hasn't confirmed his attendance. Iglesias said that it would
<br>be an important sign if Raul were given external exposure at
<br>an international forum like this. Nonetheless, Iglesias said
<br>that he isn't sure that the Cubans are ready for Raul to be
<br>seen as the head of state. While Iglesias hasn't met Raul, he
<br>knows the other key players in the current triumvirate: Vice
<br>President Carlos Lage and Foreign Minister Felipe Perez
<br>Roque. He judged that while Perez Roque just spews the party
<br>line, Lage is trusted by Raul and "a guy that you can talk
<br>to."
<br>
<br>-- Venezuela --
<br>
<br>¶5. (C/NF) Iglesias said that everyone in Latin America is
<br>concerned by the behavior of Hugo Chavez, who is becoming
<br>increasingly megalomaniacal. Iglesias said that over the
<br>years he has spent a lot of time with Chavez, and has
<br>recently seen more mistakes and incompetence. He noted that
<br>Chavez's UNGA speech destroyed a lot of his support within
<br>Latin America. Iglesias said that Chile finally decided to
<br>abstain from the UNSC vote out of frustration with Chavez's
<br>support of Bolivian outposts on the Chile-Bolivia border.
<br>
<br>-- Brazil --
<br>
<br>¶6. (C/NF) According to Iglesias, Chavez's financing of seven
<br>or eight additional outposts on the Brazil-Bolivia border is
<br>now encouraging Lula to turn his back on Chavez. Iglesias
<br>seemed confident that Lula would win the second round of the
<br>presidential election. He said that a recently re-elected
<br>Lula might begin to actively seek to contain Chavez, might
<br>well look for a stronger relation with Mexico, and might even
<br>
<br>MADRID 00002708 002 OF 002
<br>
<br>
<br>reach out to the US on trade.
<br>
<br>-- Mexico --
<br>
<br>¶7. (C/NF) Iglesias worried about the situation in Mexico,
<br>which has not been able to consolidate the democratic gains
<br>that came with the election of Fox. He said that the
<br>instability and lawlessness in Oaxaca are of real concern,
<br>though the recent PRI victory in the gubernatorial race in
<br>neighboring Tabasco is a positive sign. Iglesias said that
<br>Lopez Obrador would have been a bad president but his
<br>post-election behavior has been so horrible that he is
<br>definitively finished in Mexican politics.
