<br>SUBJECT: AZNAR KEPT UNDER WRAPS IN EU PARLIAMENT ELECTION
<br>CAMPAIGN CENTERED ON IRAQ, US TIES
<br>
<br>
<br>Classified By: Polcouns Kathleen Fitzpatrick, per 1.4 (b) and (d).
<br>
<br>Summary
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Jose Maria Aznar did not participate in the Popular
<br>Party's campaign for the June 13 EU parliamentary election.
<br>With the Socialists making the war in Iraq and distancing
<br>Spanish foreign policy from the US their central campaign
<br>issues, Popular Party leaders decided that Aznar was too
<br>radioactive to help in the campaign. Aznar insiders tell us
<br>that Aznar recognized this as well, but is confident time
<br>will ultimately vindicate his policies. Many in the PP
<br>regarded Aznar's May visit to the US, which included a
<br>private meeting with President Bush, as inopportune. They
<br>believe the visit give the Socialists ammunition in their
<br>efforts to portray the PP as a tool of the US. Following his
<br>US visit, Aznar avoided the media and focused on presiding
<br>over the PP think tank (FAES) and learning English in
<br>preparation for speaking engagements. On June 13, the
<br>Popular Party succeeded in beating expectations and came
<br>within two points of the Socialists in the EU election. End
<br>Summary.
<br>
<br>Aznar Radioactive
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Aznar's longtime associate and former State Secretary
<br>for Communication Alfredo Timmermans told us recently that
<br>Aznar's decision to play no public role in the June 13 EU
<br>parliament election campaign was his choice, but that it also
<br>reflected the preference of PP leaders. The Socialists
<br>(PSOE) sought a repeat of their March 14 surprise election
<br>victory and played up themes that had worked for them,
<br>notably opposition to the Iraq war and Aznar's close
<br>relations with the US. Timmermans said that Aznar was
<br>fully aware that he was politically radioactive and, as a
<br>result, kept a low profile. His only public activities were
<br>to appear at signings of new his book recounting his years in
<br>office. (Timmermans noted sales are going well and the book
<br>is now in its second printing.)
<br>
<br>"Photo of the Azores"
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) A Socialist refrain from the EU parliament election
<br>campaign was the need to correct "the photo of the Azores."
<br>To them, the March 2003 Azores summit stands for committing
<br>Spain to an Iraq conflict that the Spanish public wanted no
<br>part of and for allying with the US instead of France and
<br>Germany.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) For this reason, there was unease in the PP when
<br>Aznar visited the US in May 2004, only weeks after stepping
<br>down from office. While PP leaders stated that Aznar had a
<br>right to travel where he wished, many, including Aznar
<br>loyalists, felt that given the EU election Aznar should have
<br>postponed the trip until after June 13. Timmermans told us
<br>that many in the PP wanted Aznar to "stay home and say
<br>nothing." Timmermans said Aznar understood that he is, for
<br>the present, a divisive figure but that he is confident time
<br>will vindicate his policies toward Iraq and the US.
<br>Timmermans said Aznar was buoyed by the warm reception he
<br>received in the US and, in particular, by his meeting with
<br>President Bush. Timmermans contrasted this warmth with the
<br>reticence Aznar has encountered from some in the Popular
<br>Party since March 14.
<br>
<br>Aznar's Messages to the US
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Timmermans noted that Aznar had expressed concern to
<br>President Bush that the March 11 Madrid terrorist attacks had
<br>sent a message to terrorists that they can influence
<br>elections. Aznar urged vigilance in advance of US
<br>elections. Aznar believes al Qaeda inspired terrorists
<br>might also target countries like Italy where public opinion
<br>is vulnerable. Timmermans said Aznar believes the US has
<br>to brace for continued bad news from Iraq and came away with
<br>the impression that some US observers may be too optimistic
<br>about the medium term outlook. Timmermans said an election
<br>defeat by President Bush in November would be read, rightly
<br>or wrongly, in Spain as a defeat for the Popular Party and
<br>would give the Socialists a boost.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Timmermans said the PP, Aznar included, continues to
<br>be "astonished" by the chain of events from the March 11
<br>terrorist attacks to surprise election defeat on March 14.
<br>Many Popular Party members, Timmermans said, blame Aznar's
<br>Iraq policy for the defeat and believe Aznar gambled with the
<br>party's future on Iraq and lost. Like other Spaniards (80
<br>percent according to some polls), most PP members were not
<br>sorry to see the Spanish troops come home, Timmermans said.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Timmermans underlined that Aznar remains unyielding
<br>in his beliefs. Aznar will continue to support the Iraq war
<br>and say publicly that the Madrid terrorist attacks on March
<br>11 brought the Socialists to power. Timmermans (speaking
<br>before June 13) noted that President Zapatero is still in the
<br>honeymoon phase and thus the PSOE would have an important
<br>electoral advantage. Zapatero has not had to make any
<br>unpopular decisions and his one major decision ) to pull the
<br>troops out ) was highly popular. Timmermans said that all
<br>of Zapatero's decisions are taken with one idea in mind:
<br>doing what is popular.
<br>
<br>Aznar's Future
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Aznar is confident that in the longer term, he will
<br>be vindicated, Timmermans said. However, the current period
<br>is a difficult one for the PP and for Aznar personally. In
<br>the coming year, Aznar intends to travel frequently to the
<br>US. While based in Spain, he will make speeches to US
<br>audiences and teach occasional seminars at Georgetown.
<br>Aznar is working hard on his English and is presiding over
<br>the Popular Party think tank, FAES. Timmermans said Aznar
<br>will make it a point to speak out in favor of the
<br>transatlantic link and the need for close relations with the
<br>United States.
<br>
<br>June 13: PP Exceeds Expectations, On Road to Recovery
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Popular Party strategists told us in the run up to
<br>the June 13 election that the PP goal was to keep the race
<br>close. None said that they expected to win, but they did
<br>hope to cut the Socialist margin. Polling had given the
<br>Socialists a 6 to 9 point advantage. The June 13 result was
<br>far tighter: the Socialists won by only two points. PP
<br>leaders regard this as a relative victory. Jorge Moragas,
<br>PP Director for International Affairs, told us that the
<br>result at least succeeded in giving a "shock" to the
<br>over-confidence of the Socialists and is a signal the PP is
<br>on the road to recovery.
