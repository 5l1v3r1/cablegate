<br> 
<br>Classified By: EcoPol Chief Mike Hammer for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (S) Summary:  Over the past couple of days statements from 
<br>military leaders have taken a conciliatory tone and moved 
<br>away from the confrontational rhetoric from Armed Forces 
<br>Commander General Wilfredo Vargas.  Vargas relayed a message 
<br>to the Ambassador that his troops would only intervene in 
<br>"Media Luna" opposition states if leaders clearly break with 
<br>the constitution, for example by declaring independence.  The 
<br>Vice President echoed a similar message in a December 14 
<br>meeting when he told the Ambassador that the government is 
<br>not planning a state of siege or military action unless it is 
<br>required to defend government offices or protect the people. 
<br>Although the military is making plans to deploy 70 additional 
<br>companies to opposition-led departments (states), military 
<br>planners have told us that President Evo Morales has given 
<br>them instructions not to incur civilian casualties.  Field 
<br>commanders continue to tell us they will require a written 
<br>order from President Morales if asked to commit violence 
<br>against opposition demonstrators.  Even with such an order, 
<br>commanders are prepared to stand down and confine their 
<br>troops to barracks.  Imposing a police state on rebel 
<br>departments presents several difficulties: the military views 
<br>this as strictly a police function; the military does not 
<br>presently have the supplies or logistics in place to conduct 
<br>such an operation; many key officers have ties with the 
<br>opposition departments in the Media Luna; and the military 
<br>knows based on past history that they will be held 
<br>accountable.  An influential senator told us the opposition 
<br>is not nearly as concerned with military heavy handedness as 
<br>they are with altiplano police and mysterious "foreign" 
<br>fighters.  End Summary. 
<br> 
<br>Vargas: With Evo or Against Evo? 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S)xxxxxxxxxxxx asked Military 
<br>Group Commander on December 13 to tell the Ambassador that in 
<br>case of confrontations in opposition-led "Media Luna" 
<br>departments (states), troops would be deployed in the same 
<br>manner as during the violent November 23-24 Sucre 
<br>demonstrations: troops would protect military and government 
<br>property, but would not enforce a crackdown on civilians. 
<br>This contradicted xxxxxxxxxxxx' December 7 public statement that 
<br>"the true cowards are in the (opposition-controlled) Media 
<br>Luna"  and that the military would "defend the homeland" in 
<br>Santa Cruz to ensure "the security of all."  Although he 
<br>called for increased political dialogue, xxxxxxxxxxxx laid the 
<br>blame for any conflict in the future squarely with the 
<br>opposition for provoking and misinforming Bolivians, without 
<br>offering "any substantive solutions."  But now xxxxxxxxxxxx has 
<br>changed his tune, saying he would only use the military to 
<br>quell civil disorder if the opposition acted in a clearly 
<br>unconstitutional way, for example by declaring independence. 
<br>He did not consider the proposal of autonomy statutes to be a 
<br>clear violation of the constitution. xxxxxxxxxxxx did stress, 
<br>however, that he would not tolerate insubordination or coup 
<br>plotting within his ranks.  The Ambassador was also assured 
<br>by Vice President Garcia Linera on December 14 that the 
<br>government would not declare a state of siege or use the 
<br>military unless it needed to defend government offices or 
<br>protect people. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S) That xxxxxxxxxxxx made his highly-political comments xxxxxxxxxxx angered many 
<br>commanders.  Many commanders were also critical of xxxxxxxxxxx, as they feared it 
<br>opened the military to charges of taking political sides 
<br>beyond its institutional role.xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx had been,xxxxxxxxxxx a supporter 
<br>of U.S.-Bolivian military relations.  Although he continues 
<br>to cooperate enthusiastically with us at a working level, 
<br>xxxxxxxxxxx his 
<br>public comments in the last few months have irritated 
<br>Bolivian military officers and raised eyebrows within the 
<br>Embassy.  When given an opening to defend us regarding 
<br>conspiracy charges, he only said the charges should be 
<br>investigated.  When given a chance to opine on Morales' 
<br>celebration of Che Guevara,s 1967 rebellion and criticism of 
<br>Bolivian troops, he said everyone has the right to their own 
<br>opinion. 
<br> 
<br>Setting the Groundwork for Possible Military Action 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) Government rhetoric calmed somewhat this week, with 
<br>officials including Morales making empty overtures about 
<br>dialogue and stressing that the opposition, not the 
<br>government, is pushing the country to conflict.  But 
<br>government officials also warned that if dialogue failed and 
<br>opposition "sedition" continued, the government would have no 
<br>choice but to use force.  "The state is disposed to use 
<br>institutions of force to preserve internal order and 
<br>democratic stability," said Government Minister Alfredo Rada. 
<br> Rada's Vice-Minister Ruben Gamarra said the government would 
<br>not allow department or civic officials to "threaten the 
<br>unity of the country" as a matter of constitutional 
<br>obligation.  Gamarra said the military also supports this 
<br>position.  The Vice President also told the Ambassador that 
<br>"the president and I must guarantee the country's integrity 
<br>and stability."  The Ambassador made clear that the United 
<br>States supports a united and democratic Bolivia. 
<br> 
<br>Military Leaders Stress Calm and Police Role 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) On December 12, the military spoke for itself, backing 
<br>away from confrontational remarks.  Minister of Defense 
<br>Walker San Miguel confirmed that the armed forces were on 
<br>alert, but said the motive was to protect public and private 
<br>property, not to quell unrest.  San Miguel told the press the 
<br>police are responsible for maintaining civil order, not the 
<br>military.  San Miguel discounted any possibility of declaring 
<br>a state of emergency in opposition departments and criticized 
<br>"paranoid" opposition leaders for asserting that President 
<br>Morales had ordered an imminent "militarization." (Note: 
<br>Opposition rumors include appointing military officers 
<br>temporarily to state and city civilian leadership positions. 
<br>End Note.)  San Miguel explained although there had been no 
<br>troop mobilizations, the military remains "concerned."  Army 
<br>Commander Freddy Bersatti said he hoped God would guide 
<br>opposition leaders to make good decisions "for the peace and 
<br>coexistence of all Bolivians." 
<br> 
<br>Military to Retreat from Civilian Confrontations 
<br>--------------------------------------------- --- 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) Planning of troop deployments to opposition 
<br>departments was conducted December 7 and 8 and continued to 
<br>be refined this week.  Participating commanders told us the 
<br>deployment would involve 70 companies.  Army Chief of Staff 
<br>Gen. Freddy Mackay, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Daniel 
<br>Salazar, and Navy Chief of Staff Admiral Ernesto Roca are the 
<br>chief planners. 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (S) A senior military planner told DAO December 13 that 
<br>President Morales wants the military to be careful to avoid 
<br>violent confrontations with demonstrators if called upon to 
<br>support Bolivian police.  Despite public bravado, the planner 
<br>said Morales understands deaths will erode political support. 
<br> He confirmed some units have already deployed to key 
<br>locations throughout the Media Luna to secure gas lines, 
<br>public utilities, and government buildings.  The planner said 
<br>the units would not be armed and would incorporate local 
<br>indigenous to minimize the potential for conflict.  If the 
<br>opposition attempts to take these strategic locations by 
<br>force, the military would retreat. 
<br> 
<br>Santa Chavez to Fund Bolivian Deployments 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (S) Until recently, it was unclear how such a deployment 
<br>would be funded.  However, military contacts said December 13 
<br>that $5 million became available this week to fund an 
<br>increased military presence in opposition-led departments and 
<br>another $1.3 million had been allocated for non-lethal 
<br>supplies, such as riot-control gas.  The money was supposedly 
<br>freed up from Venezuelan sources, but this is not confirmed. 
<br>It will take time, at least two weeks, before the new funding 
<br>results in equipped troops on the ground in opposition 
<br>departments. 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (C) Supply and logistics issues continue to be an 
<br>operational impediment to any proposed military crackdown, 
<br>and it may take months before the new funding resolves these 
<br>shortcomings at remote posts.  Bolivia has not spent any 
<br>money on ammunition in two years, and the capacity to quickly 
<br>move troops remains in doubt.  xxxxxxxxxxx told xxxxxxxxxxx he had 
<br>only two trucks and enough fuel to send his single plane on 
<br>one reconnaissance mission. 
<br> 
<br>Venezuelan Cash and Foreign Fighters 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (S) xxxxxxxxxxx said Morales understands he risks 
<br>losing the military if he pushes them into a police force 
<br>role.  Because of this, he felt Morales would rely on the 
<br>police from the altiplano and "volunteers from other 
<br>countries" to combat opposition forces should an open 
<br>conflict develop.  xxxxxxxxxxxx said Cuban hospitals could easily 
<br>be "converted to barracks," but had no idea how many 
<br>Venezuelan and Cubans would be willing or available to fight 
<br>for Evo's government. 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (S) Military contacts are concerned a few rogue 
<br>commanders might obey orders to enforce a police state, their 
<br>loyalty greased with Venezuelan pay-offs.  They asserted 
<br>Venezuelan money would also make it difficult for the 
<br>high-command to refuse such orders.  Although Venezuelan 
<br>"bonuses" have cemented some loyalty, it has also created 
<br>much resentment in the mid- and lower-ranks and cost the high 
<br>command significant legitimacy.  According xxxxxxxxxxx and field 
<br>commanders, there is also a high degree of frustration with 
<br>the perceived meddling of Venezuelan advisors in the internal 
<br>functions of the military and of overtly political statements 
<br>and actions of the high command (such as Army Commander 
<br>Bersatti's decision to wear a red poncho in solidarity with 
<br>the violent, pro-government Red Ponchos group a year ago). 
<br> 
<br>Mixed Signals on Holiday Troop Strength 
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (C) Although planning and funding appear to be in place, 
<br>the military was sending out mixed signals as to its 
<br>intentions.  There has been no order to extend assignments or 
<br>cancel leave, as would be expected prior to a major military 
<br>undertaking.  About 70 percent of the army's conscript force 
<br>will be rotating during the first two weeks of January. 
<br>Allowing inexperienced troops to transfer into the bulk of 
<br>Media Luna enlisted positions, rather than keeping its 
<br>existing troops in place, might signal that the government 
<br>does not anticipate a major conflict in the near-future. 
<br>However, a senior military planner told DATT that keeping the 
<br>conscripts from rotating would be "more trouble than it is 
<br>worth" and that new troops would be more motivated.  He also 
<br>anticipated an order canceling leave before December 19. 
<br>Another potential tripwire: graduations at the military 
<br>academy in Cochabamba Department were moved up four days to 
<br>December 12. 
<br> 
<br>Field Commanders Set to Stand Down 
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶14. (S) Although xxxxxxxxxxx and others in the high command may be 
<br>coy, many field commanders continue to tell us they will not 
<br>participate in violence against opposition demonstrations. 
<br>xxxxxxxxxxx was on hand when a high-ranking civil defense 
<br>officer told the commander in Tarija Department to demand a 
<br>written order from President Morales if asked to take action 
<br>against opposition leaders or demonstrators.  If they 
<br>received such an order, the officer advised non-compliance 
<br>and a post lock down to commanders from Cochabamba, Santa 
<br>Cruz, and Tarija.  The civil defense officer told MILGP 
<br>Commander he expects commanders will not use force. 
<br> 
<br>¶15. (C) xxxxxxxxxxx told Emboff that 
<br>Minister of Government Rada contacted the Navy leadership 
<br>when violent protests broke out in Cobija, Pando on November 
<br>30 and asked the Navy to step in and enforce order (Note: 
<br>the Navy is the strongest military branch in the department 
<br>of Pando).  Navy commanders said they would comply when 
<br>provided a signed order from Morales.  Rada never called 
<br>back.  xxxxxxxxxxxx told PolOffs the air force in 
<br>Cobija was similarly requested to take control of the 
<br>civilian airport, requested a written order, and never got 
<br>one. 
<br> 
<br>X-Factors: Institutionalism, Regionalism, and Wives 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
<br> 
<br>¶16. (C) xxxxxxxxxxx told us despite government and high-command 
<br>rhetoric about the military's "constitutional role," most 
<br>commanders thought the government violated the law and the 
<br>constitution by excluding the opposition from key sessions of 
<br>Congress and the Constituent Assembly and, therefore, "have 
<br>no right to invoke the constitution."  A strong commitment to 
<br>institutionalism would require a rock-solid constitutional 
<br>argument before commanders would participate in any action 
<br>that could be considered "political." 
<br> 
<br>¶17. (C) xxxxxxxxxxx said commanders ultimately place loyalty to 
<br>their region above all other considerations.  Although most 
<br>commanders are originally from the altiplano, they have spent 
<br>most of their careers stationed in the Media Luna.  He said 
<br>many officers worked with the same opposition leaders the 
<br>government might call on them to unseat, a prospect he found 
<br>"very unlikely."  Many altiplano officers marry in the Media 
<br>Luna and have family there.  As for the large minority of 
<br>officers from the Media Luna, including himself, Suarez said 
<br>there is "no way any of us are going to attack our own 
<br>people."  Rather, he said, they would side with the 
<br>opposition if forced to take sides. 
<br> 
<br>xxxxxxxxxxx "Divided" Military Won,t Intervene 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br> 
<br>¶18. (C) xxxxxxxxxxx told PolOff 
<br>December 14 the opposition did not believe the "divided" 
<br>military would repress them, but were more concerned about 
<br>irregular pro-government militias organized and financed by 
<br>Venezuelans and Cubans.  xxxxxxxxxxx, however, provided no details 
<br>on the supposed paramilitary organizations.  xxxxxxxxxxxx said, in 
<br>any event, he expected no violent stand-off with the 
<br>government before January as both sides are "disorganized." 
<br> 
<br>Comment: 
<br>-------- 
<br> 
<br>¶19. (C) The best the government can hope for if it gives the 
<br>order to bust opposition heads is sporadic and half-hearted 
<br>compliance from a minority of commanders.  Although they can 
<br>be expected to protect government infrastructure and 
<br>transportation, most commanders are likely to sit out any 
<br>violent confrontation with opposition forces.  Consistent 
<br>with out November assessment (Reftel B), we continue to 
<br>believe the military will choose to ignore orders that are 
<br>not solidly linked to their constitutional role, in writing, 
<br>or that requires them to spill Bolivian blood. 
<br> 
<br>¶20. (C) Despite bravado from field commanders, DAO expects 
<br>them to frame any potential insubordination as "selective 
<br>non-compliance" to their superiors.  Although field 
<br>commanders may be anxious about day after scenarios if they 
<br>disobey orders, it would be difficult for the government to 
<br>replace "insubordinate" officers, particularly if officers 
<br>refused such orders en masse.  It is unlikely the government 
<br>would find more loyal commanders in the lower ranks, 
<br>uncertain if rank and file troops would recognize them, and 
<br>unclear if such an overly political reorganization would be 
<br>tolerated by the high command.  Unlike his erstwhile ally 
<br>Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, Evo does not have a network 
<br>of personal friends within the military (although his 
<br>Presidency Minister Juan Quintana does), and the military is 
<br>leery of taking on any role considered remotely political. 
<br>The military fears above all a repeat of the bloody 
<br>military-civilian conflicts in El Alto in 2003, which brought 
<br>down the Goni government.  Many commanders are still bitter 
<br>about the fallout from those events and believe the military 
<br>took the risks and the blame for political decisions. 
<br> 
<br>¶21. (C) xxxxxxxxxxx remains an enigma.  Some commanders suspected, 
<br>at least xxxxxxxxxxxxxx, that he might be 
<br>sympathetic to a coup.  He is widely characterized as an 
<br>"opportunist" xxxxxxxxxxx.  Under intense pressure from both political sides, 
<br>he plays both sides.  We cannot expect him to stand behind 
<br>his assurances.  End Comment.
