<br>SUBJECT: KOUCHNER EXPECTED TO MEET IRANIAN COUNTERPART AT 
<br>UNGA BUT NOT SARKOZY 
<br> 
<br>REF: A. (A) PARIS POINTS 20 SEPTEMBER 2007 
<br> 
<br>     ¶B. (B) PARIS 3668 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Acting Political Minister-Counselor Andrew Young for rea 
<br>sons 1.4. (b), (d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (C)  During a September 19 call on French MFA 
<br>DAS-equivalent for the Levant Ludovic Pouille, we asked 
<br>whether he had heard anything that might indicate FM Kouchner 
<br>or any other French officials planned to meet with Iranian 
<br>President Ahmadi Nejad in New York.  Pouille shook his head 
<br>no on Ahmadi Nejad, but he stated that Kouchner is scheduled 
<br>to meet with his Iranian counterpart on the margins of the 
<br>UNGA. 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (C)  Although Pouille does not cover Iran, he stated that 
<br>posts throughout the NEA region had reported queries from 
<br>host governments about France,s policy in light of FM 
<br>Kouchner,s recent remarks about the possibility the 
<br>confrontation over Iran,s nuclear program could lead to war. 
<br> This had necessitated the drafting of &talking points8 to 
<br>be sent out worldwide to refocus attention on what Kouchner 
<br>said about the need to pursue diplomacy to the maximum extent 
<br>possible.  Pouille (strictly protect) opined that Kouchner 
<br>had not for the first time allowed his tongue to get ahead of 
<br>his brain in terms of his public utterances.  He has 
<br>struggled since to get the emphasis back on diplomatic 
<br>efforts to resolve the nuclear issue and to minimize the 
<br>importance of his reference to the possibility of war. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C)  We spoke September 20 to French MFA Iran desk 
<br>officer Arnaud Pescheux, who confirmed his understanding that 
<br>Kouchner was currently the most senior French official 
<br>expected to meet with the Iranians in New York, and then only 
<br>the foreign minister.  He related that the Iranian mission in 
<br>New York had passed a formal written request to the French 
<br>mission for an Ahmadi Nejad/Sarkozy meeting.  The GOF had 
<br>ignored the request in the same manner it ignored Ahmadi 
<br>Nejad,s congratulatory message to Sarkozy after his election 
<br>as president.  Nonetheless, and as Kouchner has publicly 
<br>stated, Pescheux underscored that France continues to have a 
<br>normal relationship with Iran across the board, covering a 
<br>host of bilateral and regional issues (notably Lebanon). 
<br>This includes frequent visits to Paris by Iranian officials. 
<br>Tension over the nuclear issue has not changed this, even 
<br>though it has obviously complicated the bilateral dialogue 
<br>somewhat.  In this respect, Pescheux stated that the French 
<br>embassy in Tehran has received numerous complaints about 
<br>recent public French statements despite the fact that few of 
<br>them have been replayed fully via the Iranian media to the 
<br>public at large.  (Comment:  This echoes what MFA 
<br>DAS-equivalent for Iran, Iraq, and the Gulf Franck Gellet and 
<br>others have told us per ref b.  End comment) 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (C)  With respect to the new channel Velayati has tried 
<br>to open via Gellet and Presidency strategic affairs adviser 
<br>Francois Richier (also ref b), Pescheux said that it was not 
<br>closed off, just inactive until such time as France might 
<br>decide to make use of it.  He repeated that the GOF is fully 
<br>aware that Tehran is trying to divide the P-5 1 by opening 
<br>such a channel.  As for the idea, bruited by Pouille, that 
<br>French special envoy for Lebanon Jean-Claude Cousseran might 
<br>travel to Tehran with a larger mandate than the situation in 
<br>Lebanon, Pescheux said that was under discussion.  Nothing 
<br>had been decided, either in terms of dispatching Cousseran on 
<br>such a mission or possible timing, although it was unlikely 
<br>to happen prior to the end of the ministerial portion of the 
<br>current UNGA.  Pescheux reiterated the often expressed view 
<br>at the Quai that, unlike Syria, Iran is not presently 
<br>inclined to stir things up in Lebanon.  He explained that for 
<br>Iran, the consequences of a renewed civil war that could 
<br>inter alia pit Sunnis against Shi,a would set Iranian 
<br>efforts to expand its regional influence back. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (C)  Comment:  As ref a demonstrates, Kouchner is not 
<br>only trying to recast his earlier remarks in a way that 
<br>downplays references to the possibility of war with Iran but 
<br>to underscore his readiness to engage with Iran including via 
<br>a trip to Tehran.  We are not aware of any plans for Kouchner 
<br>to travel there, however, and he was very careful when he 
<br>responded to a reporter,s question on this that he kept it 
<br>limited to whether in principle he was prepared to go. 
<br>Despite the rhetoric and the furor surrounding Kouchner,s 
<br>remarks, the French have not closed any doors to continued 
<br>engagement.  We think it unlikely, given the charged 
<br>atmosphere and the French determination to keep Ahmadi Nejad 
<br>at arms length, that President Sarkozy will meet formally 
<br>with him on the margins of UNGA, although we would not rule 
<br>out the possibility of an impromptu pull-aside should the two 
<br>find themselves at a group event organized by the UN. 
<br>Sarkozy was unwavering in a national television interview 
<br>

<br> 
<br> 
<br>September 21 that Iran must not be allowed to develop nuclear 
<br>weapons.
