<br>SUBJECT: IRANIAN SOURCE NAMES "U.K.-REGISTERED" COMPANY AS 
<br>IRAN SANCTIONS-BUSTER POSSIBLY SUPPORTING BUSHEIR PROJECT 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: POLECON COUNSELOR ROB GARVERICK, REASON 1.5 (B and D) 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (S)  A well-connected Iranian businessman who owns a 
<br>Baku-based oil services company told Baku Iran watcher that a 
<br>company called "INSULTEC," owned by UK citizens of Indian 
<br>origin, has secretly provided cladding, thermal insulation, 
<br>and ancillary equipment to the government of Iran in a 
<br>variety of shipments via Turkey and the U.A.E.  According to 
<br>the Baku source, whose company operates in Russia, 
<br>Kazakhstan, and the U.A.E. as well as Azerbaijan, the 
<br>materials allegedly sent by INSULTEC in falsely labeled 
<br>containers were of type that could be used in nuclear reactor 
<br>construction.  Citing old Iran and Dubai based business 
<br>friends allegedly familiar with the issue, the source said 
<br>that INSULTEC has maintained a sanctions-evading relationship 
<br>with Iranian government companies for some time.  Source said 
<br>that the company was officially headquartered in the U.K., 
<br>and has offices in Germany, the USA, and elsewhere, its 
<br>manufacturing base and the bulk of its staff are in India. 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (S) Perhaps more disturbingly, the source (who had just 
<br>returned from ten days in Dubai) said that he had been 
<br>informed by an Iranian friend who had collaborated in the 
<br>activity that INSULTEC recently helped facilitate a shipment 
<br>from the UAE to Iran consisting of twelve containers 
<br>(possibly labeled "insulation") of unknown material that may 
<br>not have actually originated with INSULTEC.  The source sai 
<br>he was told by his friend that the shipment went by ship to 
<br>Bandar Abbas and was trucked immediately to a final 
<br>destination in Busheir.  The friend told source that another 
<br>Iranian destination was falsely listed in the shipping 
<br>documents, presumably to hide the actually intended 
<br>destination of Busheir. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (S) The Baku businessman is a UK-educated engineer from a 
<br>prominent Pre-Revolution Isfahan family, and formerly owned a 
<br>large factory in Iran.  He is a former national fencing 
<br>champion of Iran. former President of the Iran Fencing 
<br>Association, and Vice-President of an Azerbaijan sports 
<br>association.  He has been based in Baku for more than ten 
<br>years, working primarily as a sub-contractor to BP and the 
<br>Cape Industrial Services company.  While his oil services 
<br>company includes an insulation division that may be in 
<br>competition with INSULTEC, source has provided "inside" 
<br>information on many other Iranian issues (including 
<br>comprehensive data on the status of new Iranian oil refinery 
<br>construction) that does not relate to his private interests 
<br>in any way. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (S) Note: A quick google check revealed several companies 
<br>with the name INSULTEC in the title - these may or not be 
<br>affiliated.  Based on the information provided by source 
<br>(currently in Iran, where he frequently travels), one 
<br>possible candidate could be "INSULTEC Chitral Ltd."    End 
<br>Note.
