<br>
<br>Classified By: POL MC Kathleen H. Allegrone for reasons 1.4 (B & D). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) SUMMARY: S/WCI Ambassador Williamson met with 
<br>French MFA officials on February 16 to discuss detainee 
<br>issues, France's role in the EU process and possible 
<br>resettlement of Guantanamo Bay detainees in France. 
<br>Williamson noted that France has a unique role to play in 
<br>formulating a process within the European Union (EU) to 
<br>accept detainees and helping assuage the concerns of member 
<br>states that might stymie EU consensus on the issue. Foreign 
<br>Ministry Director of Communications and spokesman Eric 
<br>Chevallier reiterated France's willingness to assist the U.S. 
<br>on this issue (ref b and c), but noted that the GOF position 
<br>was "very clear": detainees would be reviewed on a 
<br>case-by-case basis; the detainee had to specifically request 
<br>resettlement in France; and France would need full 
<br>information on interested detainees to review any security 
<br>and judicial implications. Chevallier said the GOF supports 
<br>an open EU process that would allow decisions to be made on a 
<br>national basis, similar to what current EU president the 
<br>Czech Republic has proposed. The most important issue, he 
<br>said, would be addressing concerns among Schengen countries. 
<br>Williamson said the U.S. is aware of the complexities of the 
<br>Schengen issue and pledges to work with EU partners as they 
<br>address these concerns. Chevallier said the GOF was also 
<br>concerned about recent USG talks with Lithuania on detainees 
<br>(ref d). France, he cautioned, was standing firm on the 
<br>necessity of an EU process before implementation of bilateral 
<br>agreements between the USG and EU member states on the 
<br>matter. Williamson noted that recent public pledges by 
<br>Lithuania to accept Guantanamo detainees were the result of 
<br>almost two years of talks, and that Lithuania has been firm 
<br>that implementation of an agreement to accept detainees would 
<br>occur only after agreement of a common EU position. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) SUMMARY CONTINUED: Chevallier noted French concern 
<br>that former detainees, after being released from Guantanamo, 
<br>could return to or become involved in terrorist activities. 
<br>Williamson noted that of the approximately 60 detainees for 
<br>whom the U.S. was seeking resettlement all had been 
<br>previously approved for transfer. Chevallier asked if there 
<br>were any USG plans to transfer detainees to other parts of 
<br>the U.S. without the promise of a swift trial and if the U.S. 
<br>was going to accept some of these low-risk detainees. 
<br>Chevallier claimed that the more information France had 
<br>regarding these issues the better able it would be to 
<br>persuade the French public and other EU member states by 
<br>highlighting U.S. efforts to resettle the detainees. 
<br>Williamson replied that the interagency review process headed 
<br>by the Attorney General would try to answer these and other 
<br>questions regarding the detainees. Chevallier gave his 
<br>support to help with future meetings on this issue with the 
<br>French ministries of justice and the interior. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) S/WCI Ambassador Clint Williamson met on February 16 
<br>with French MFA advisors to the foreign minister Eric 
<br>Chevallier and Sylvie Pantz, as well as with MFA Desk Officer 
<br>for Strategic Affairs Camille Petit. Charg Mark Pekala, 
<br>Embassy poloff and Shaun Coughlin (S/WCI) also participated.

<br>
<br>Detainees: French Open to Helping U.S. 
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) In response to President Obama's January 22 
<br>Executive Order to close detention facilities at Guantanamo 
<br>Bay Naval Base (ref a), French FM Kouchner publicly gave his 
<br>support to review the idea of accepting detainees deemed not 
<br>to be a security risk (ref b). S/WCI Ambassador Williamson 
<br>followed up with advisors to the French foreign minister on 
<br>February 16 to seek GOF cooperation on the resettlement of 
<br>Guantanamo detainees. Williamson noted that President Obama 
<br>and Secretary Clinton strongly believe closing the detention 
<br>center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba is a critical foreign policy 
<br>issue facing the USG. Secretary Clinton asked Williamson to 
<br>meet with European partners to explain the USG position on 
<br>this matter since the change of administration. Williamson 
<br>thanked France for its help on this issue, noting that France 
<br>has a unique role to play in formulating a process within the 
<br>European Union (EU) to accept detainees and helping assuage 
<br>the concerns of member states that might stymie EU consensus 
<br>on the issue. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) Foreign Ministry spokesman Eric Chevallier 
<br>reiterated France's willingness to assist the U.S. on this 
<br>issue (ref b and c), but clarified the GOF position: 
<br>detainees would be reviewed on a case-by-case basis; the 
<br>
<br>detainee had to specifically request resettlement in France; 
<br>and France would need full information on interested 
<br>detainees in order to review any security and judicial 
<br>implications. Chevallier said the GOF was "happy, in 
<br>principal" that the prison would be closed, but noted that 
<br>any agreement by France to accept detainees could not be 
<br>centered on discussions of "numbers" (i.e., France, and other 
<br>EU members, cannot be told they have to accept a specific 
<br>number of detainees). 
<br>
<br>
<br>French Stress Importance of Common EU Position 
<br>--------------------------------------------- - 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) Chevallier said the GOF supports an open EU process 
<br>that would allow decisions to be made on a national basis, 
<br>similar to what the Czech Republic has been proposing. The 
<br>most important issue, he said, would be addressing concerns 
<br>among Schengen countries. Williamson said the U.S. was aware 
<br>of the complexities of the Schengen issue and pledged to work 
<br>with EU partners as they address these concerns. Williamson 
<br>said the USG was concerned about the potential for any EU 
<br>process to drag out, especially by EU member states that did 
<br>not want to accept detainees. The USG hopes that France 
<br>could play an important role to assuage these concerns. 
<br>Chevallier noted that while there would not be complete 
<br>consensus within the EU on whether to accept detainees the 
<br>GOF would push other EU member states to be more open. There 
<br>was room for EU evolution in a common position, he said. 
<br>Williamson also noted that EU members Ireland and Portugal 
<br>were wary of an EU process that did not allow for 
<br>flexibility, as what happened when both of these countries 
<br>were directed by the EU to take Palestinian militants 
<br>involved in the 2002 siege of the Church of the Nativity in 
<br>Bethlehem. Chevallier said that Church of the Nativity 
<br>scenario was unlikely to happen again. Rather, a solution 
<br>such as what the Czechs were now proposing seemed more likely 
<br>as it hinged on flexibility. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S/NF) Chevallier said the GOF was also concerned about 
<br>recent USG talks with Lithuania on the matter (ref d); he 
<br>hoped Williamson could provide him with more details on those 
<br>discussions. Regarding Lithuania, Williamson noted that 
<br>recent public statements by that government to accept 
<br>Guantanamo detainees were the result of almost two years of 
<br>talks. He said that Lithuania was interested in accepting 
<br>some of the Uzbek detainees because these detainees -- as was 
<br>deemed by the GOL -- could best fit into Lithuanian society 
<br>due to a common language and the presence of a large Uzbek 
<br>population in the country. Williamson clarified that the GOL 
<br>intended to implement a decision to accept these detainees 
<br>only once an EU framework had been agreed on. Williamson 
<br>also explained that the U.S. would continue to pursue 
<br>bilateral discussions with interested states as the EU 
<br>process progressed. He said that it would create inordinate 
<br>delays if bilateral discussions had to be put on hold until 
<br>the EU process was completed, and stressed that this was 
<br>entirely consistent with the preferred Czech approach of 
<br>creating a "permissive EU environment in which member states 
<br>could decide to accept detainees." Chevallier agreed that 
<br>this was a logical way forward. 
<br>
<br>
<br>Detainees: French Concerns about Security 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (S/NF) Sylvie Pantz said the GOF was concerned about the 
<br>reliability of information now available on detainees. She 
<br>said that the GOF would need as much case information as 
<br>possible in order to make a proper assessment. Pantz noted 
<br>that recent requests by the NGO community -- Reprieve and 
<br>Human Rights Watch -- to the GOF to accept detainees lacked 
<br>details, which made it difficult to verify claims of abuse 
<br>and assess security concerns. She was hoping the U.S. could 
<br>help fill these gaps. Williamson noted that a major change 
<br>within the Obama administration's approach was moving lead 
<br>responsibility for detainee status reviews from the 
<br>Department of Defense to the Department of Justice. The 
<br>Attorney General would now lead the interagency process. 
<br>Williamson said the process would ensure that all information 
<br>pertaining to a detainee was compiled in one place, that 
<br>fresh reviews of the material would take place in order to 
<br>determine prosecutability and that renewed threat assessments 
<br>would be undertaken. He said the USG was happy to facilitate 
<br>visits to Guantanamo to interview detainees who might be 
<br>resettled, as well as share medical and case records. So 
<br>far, he noted, there were 60 low-risk detainees who had been 
<br>previously approved for transfer and it was unlikely the 
<br>security assessment for these individuals would be raised, 
<br>although it was possible. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (S/NF) Pantz and Chevallier asked about recent reports of 
<br>
<br>detainees who, after being released, return to or become 
<br>involved in terrorist activities. Chevallier said there were 
<br>concerns in France that detainees determined to be low-risk 
<br>before entering Guantanamo could, depending on their 
<br>experiences in the detention center, pose serious risks to 
<br>security once released. Williamson said that out of the 525 
<br>detainees already released, over 500 returned to their home 
<br>countries. Forty to 60 of these individuals were thought to 
<br>have engaged in some sort of terrorist actions, ranging from 
<br>minor to larger acts, such as reports of detainees returning 
<br>to the battlefield in Iraq or Afghanistan. However, he 
<br>noted, all of these cases had been previously assessed as 
<br>higher risk, which was very different from the detainees for 
<br>whom the U.S. was now seeking to resettle. Williamson said 
<br>threat level assessments were based on the present state of 
<br>the detainee, taking into account interviews, psychiatric 
<br>evaluations and other reviews. He indicated that the one 
<br>other case of low-threat detainee resettlements, to Albania, 
<br>had gone well and that the eight former detainees had 
<br>assimilated to varying degrees into life there. Further, 
<br>France could be assured that the U.S. would share any 
<br>security concerns regarding the detainees with its friends 
<br>and allies. 
<br>
<br>
<br>French Questions about U.S. Plans to Resettle Detainees 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
<br>
<br>¶10. (S/NF) Chevallier asked if there were any USG plans to 
<br>transfer high-risk detainees to the U.S. without the promise 
<br>of a swift trial. He also asked if the U.S. was going to 
<br>accept some of the low-risk detainees. Chevallier noted that 
<br>more information France had regarding these issues the better 
<br>able it would be to persuade the French public and other EU 
<br>member states by highlighting U.S. efforts to find a solution 
<br>to the detainee issue. Williamson replied that the 
<br>interagency review process would try to answer these and 
<br>other questions regarding the detainees. That aside, he said 
<br>the Obama administration realizes it would be a bad idea to 
<br>simply move detainees from one place to another as it would 
<br>not adequately address the problem. Pantz asked whether 
<br>detainees who could not return home but were seeking to be 
<br>resettled would simply receive a wish list of potential 
<br>accepting countries. Williamson said the U.S. was looking 
<br>into options to establish links with potential accepting 
<br>nations and the detainee, such as what was recently done with 
<br>the Uzbeks and Lithuania, but clarified that the USG was 
<br>reluctant to simply ask detainees where they would like to go 
<br>as it could complicate the resettlement process. 
<br>
<br>
<br>Future Talks: Offer to Help 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶11. (S/NF) Chevallier suggested that for future visits 
<br>Williamson should also speak to representatives from the 
<br>French ministries of justice and the interior. He said the 
<br>MFA would take the lead on setting up these meetings for 
<br>Williamson,s next visit to France. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (U) SWCI Williamson has cleared this message.
