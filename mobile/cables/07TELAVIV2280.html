<br>SUBJECT: APHSCT TOWNSEND TAKES STOCK OF BMENA REGION WITH 
<br>MOSSAD DIRECTOR DAGAN 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Charge d'affaires Gene A. Cretz for reasons 1.4 (B/D). 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (S) SUMMARY:  Frances Fragos Townsend, Assistant to the 
<br>President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism (AFHSC), 
<br>met Mossad Director Meir Dagan on July 12 for a general 
<br>discussion of regional security threats.  On the Iranian 
<br>nuclear program, Dagan proved surprisingly optimistic about 
<br>the effects of United Nations Security Council (UNSC) 
<br>resolutions and their impact on Iranian elites.  On most 
<br>other fronts, however, Dagan expressed deep skepticism 
<br>regarding any near-term solutions.  Dagan believes that the 
<br>Syrians were emboldened by the Second Lebanon War, and argued 
<br>for a concerted international effort to enforce UNSC 
<br>resolutions in Lebanon as a means of removing Syria from 
<br>Iranian influence.  In Dagan's personal opinion, present 
<br>attempts to prop up the government of Prime Minister Salam 
<br>Fayyad will fail, and "an entirely new approach" with the 
<br>Palestinians is required.  Dagan and Townsend surveyed 
<br>political developments in North Africa, Turkey, and the Gulf, 
<br>and shared concerns about Pakistan's ability to withstand the 
<br>challenge of Islamic radicals. END SUMMARY. 
<br> 
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br>Financial Sanctions Offer Hope on Iran 
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S) Mossad Director Meir Dagan began his two-hour meeting 
<br>with Townsend by expressing satisfaction with sanctions 
<br>against Iran.  Dagan said UNSC Resolutions 1737 and 1747 
<br>caught the Iranians off-guard, and were having an impact on 
<br>the Iranian elite and financial community.  The resolutions 
<br>had been particularly successful through their indirect 
<br>consequences, explained Dagan, by stigmatizing Iranian 
<br>businesses and discouraging risk-averse Europeans from being 
<br>connected with Iran.  Dagan praised ongoing GOI-USG 
<br>cooperation on this front, and added that domestic economic 
<br>problems were creating additional pressure on the regime. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S) With regard to their nuclear program, Dagan said the 
<br>Iranians are attempting to convey a "false presentation" that 
<br>they have mastered the uranium enrichment process.  The 
<br>reality is that they are not there yet, said Dagan, and they 
<br>are paying a heavy political price (sanctions) for something 
<br>they have yet to achieve.  Dagan noted growing antipathy in 
<br>Russia towards Iran and its nuclear program, and said the 
<br>Iranians were shocked by Russian statements accusing them of 
<br>supporting terrorism against the United States.  In Dagan's 
<br>view, there is no ideological conflict within the Iranian 
<br>leadership (all wish to see the destruction of Israel), but 
<br>there is a growing divide on tactics with some supporting a 
<br>retaliatory position against the West and others favoring new 
<br>policies of moderation.  Recognizing the growing strength of 
<br>the moderate camp, Dagan said that the militant followers of 
<br>President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad are now trying to target 
<br>supporters of Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani as spies. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- - 
<br>Gulf States Await Action (From Others) on Iran 
<br>--------------------------------------------- - 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (S) According to Dagan, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf 
<br>States all fear Iran, but want someone else "to do the job 
<br>for them."  Townsend and Dagan discussed the current state of 
<br>affairs in the Saudi royal court, where the Mossad Chief 
<br>accused Foreign Minister Saud bin Faysal of playing a "very 
<br>negative role."  He also pointed to the recent visit of the 
<br>Saudi King Abdullah to Jordan as a historical first and 
<br>turning point for relations between the two countries. 
<br>Townsend agreed, and said that the Saudi king has a sense of 
<br>urgency on the political front.  Dagan characterized Qatar as 
<br>"a real problem," and accused Sheikh Hamid of "annoying 
<br>everyone."  In his view, Qatar is trying to play all sides -- 
<br>Syria, Iran, Hamas -- in an effort to achieve security and 
<br>some degree of independence.  "I think you should remove your 
<br>bases from there...seriously," said Dagan.  "They have 
<br>confidence only because of the U.S. presence."  Dagan 
<br>predicted, with some humor, that al-Jazeera would be the next 
<br>cause of war in the Middle East as some Arab leaders 
<br>(specifically Saudi Arabia) are willing to take drastic steps 
<br>to shut down the channel, and hold Sheikh Hamid personally 
<br>responsible for its provocations.

<br>Syria Taking Dangerous Risks 
<br>----------------------------

<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (S) Dagan echoed other reports that Syria expects an 
<br>Israeli attack this summer, and has raised its level of 
<br>readiness.  Despite the fact that Israel has no intention of 
<br>attacking, said Dagan, the Syrians are likely to retaliate 
<br>over even the smallest incident, which could lead to quick 
<br>escalation.  Dagan believes that Syria's strategic alliance 
<br>with Iran and Hizballah has not changed, and that Assad views 
<br>these policies as both "successful and just."  There is a 
<br>tendency to assume that Syria can be separated from Iran, 
<br>said Dagan, and that this offers the key to weakening 
<br>Hizballah.  Dagan argued that the opposite is true:  by 
<br>enforcing UN resolutions on Lebanon and increasing efforts to 
<br>disarm Hizballah, the international community can remove the 
<br>glue that binds Iran and Syria.  Enforcing the resolutions 
<br>would put additional pressure on Assad, who fears being tried 
<br>for the assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri 
<br>above all else.  The advantage of such an approach, continued 
<br>Dagan, is that the legal ground is already in place for 
<br>action by the UNSC.  This credible threat could sufficiently 
<br>frighten Syria away from Iran and towards more natural allies 
<br>in the Arab League. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br>Deep Pessimism on Relations With Palestinians 
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (S) Departing from official GOI policy, Dagan expressed 
<br>his personal opinion that after more than a decade of trying 
<br>to reach a final status agreement with the Palestinians, 
<br>"nothing will be achieved."  Only Israeli military operations 
<br>against Hamas in the West Bank prevent them from expanding 
<br>control beyond Gaza, lamented Dagan, without which Fatah 
<br>would fall within one month and Abbas would join his 
<br>"mysteriously wealthy" son in Qatar.  Offering what he 
<br>believed to be a conservative estimate, Dagan said that USD 6 
<br>billion had been invested in the Palestinian Authority since 
<br>¶1994.  "What did it accomplish, other than adding a few more 
<br>people to the Fortune 500?" asked Dagan.  Although he 
<br>expressed his personal faith in Salam Fayyad, Dagan said that 
<br>the Palestinian Prime Minister had no power base.  Fatah as a 
<br>party would have to completely reorganize itself in order to 
<br>regain credibility, argued Dagan, but instead they have 
<br>turned once again to the "old guard."  The Mossad Chief 
<br>suggested that a completely new approach was required, but 
<br>did not provide Townsend any additional details. 
<br> 
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br>Pakistan...and Other Regional Concerns 
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (S) Townsend and Dagan then embarked on an informal tour 
<br>of the region, comparing notes on countries critical to 
<br>combating terrorism.  Dagan characterized a Pakistan ruled by 
<br>radical Islamists with a nuclear arsenal at their disposal as 
<br>his biggest nightmare.  Al-Qaeda and other "Global Jihad" 
<br>groups could not be relied upon to behave rationally once in 
<br>possession of nuclear weapons, said Dagan, as they do not 
<br>care about the well being of states or their image in the 
<br>media.  "We have to keep (President Pervez) Musharaf in 
<br>power," said Dagan.  In North Africa, Dagan contended that 
<br>Qaddafi needs to be pushed more in order to put Libya on the 
<br>right track.  Qaddafi faces little domestic pressure, said 
<br>Dagan, but has traditionally responded to outside threats and 
<br>runs foreign policy based on his emotions.  The only reason 
<br>Qaddafi moderated his position to begin with, said Dagan, was 
<br>that he feared that he was "in the crosshairs" for regime 
<br>change.  Dagan viewed the situation in Algeria as more 
<br>serious, with the south of the country becoming increasingly 
<br>dangerous and the leadership uncertain as it faces radical 
<br>Islamic forces.  Morocco is coping better with these issues 
<br>"in spite of the king," said Dagan, who appears to take 
<br>little interest in governing.  In Turkey, Dagan said that 
<br>Islamists there are not of the same cloth as others in the 
<br>region, but he does fear that they are slowly breaking down 
<br>the secular character of the state and could become more 
<br>radical over time.  Dagan argued that if the Turkish military 
<br>received more direct support from the United States, it would 
<br>be better able to prevent the rise of Islamists.
