<br>TAGS: PREL PGOV ASEC AMGT AR
<br>SUBJECT: ARGENTINA: AMBASSADOR MEETS BUENOS AIRES MAYOR
<br>MACRI
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Martinez for reasons 1.4 (b) & (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Buenos Aires city mayor Mauricio Macri let
<br>slip to the Ambassador that he intends to run for president
<br>in 2011. He criticized the Kirchners for the failure of
<br>their economic model, for the country's growing crime
<br>problems, and for alienating the United States. He also
<br>reiterated past criticisms that the USG was "too soft" on the
<br>Kirchners. The Ambassador said Washington remained fully
<br>committed to deepening and strengthening relations with
<br>Argentina. Macri also reiterated an earlier invitation for
<br>the United States government to build a new site in prime
<br>real estate in downtown Buenos Aires. End Summary.
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) Mayor Macri received the Ambassador for an
<br>introductory call at City Hall on November 9. He was
<br>accompanied by his Secretary General Marcos Pena,
<br>international relations advisor Diego Guelar (former
<br>ambassador to the United States), and city international
<br>relations department chief Fulvio Pompeo. The Ambassador was
<br>accompanied by DCM and polcouns (notetaker).
<br>
<br>
<br>Macri's Take on the Kirchners
<br>-----------------------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) The Ambassador asked about relations between the city,
<br>the province and the federal government, particularly in
<br>coordinating police coverage and public security. Macri
<br>bluntly said, "There are no relations with the Kirchner
<br>administration at all." He said he would be meeting with
<br>President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner later that day, but
<br>that it was only the second time in almost two years that
<br>they have met. He said the GOA had not been receptive to
<br>city overtures to discuss jurisdiction responsibilities to be
<br>divided between the new metropolitan police force and the
<br>PFA. Indeed, Macri said he suspected the GOA was
<br>deliberately fostering havoc in the streets in order to
<br>sabotage his new metropolitan police force from the outset.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) The Ambassador said she had noticed in the press that
<br>a judge had dismissed charges against (Kirchner-allied
<br>"piquetero" social activist) Luis D'Elia for seizing a police
<br>station despite the strong evidence against him, including
<br>videotape of D'Elia. Macri said he considered the court
<br>ruling a prime example of judicial susceptibility to
<br>intimidation, but he also said he believed the decision would
<br>be appealed.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) The Ambassador noted that Macri, like many other
<br>Argentines she had spoken with, had used the word "fear" in
<br>describing the current political climate. Macri said the
<br>Kirchners often succeeded by bullying their opponents and
<br>critics, but now that 80% of the Argentine public reject the
<br>Kirchners, he thought the media were pushing back against the
<br>Kirchners where political and business leaders had not. He
<br>reprised an earlier conversation with then-WHA A/S Shannon
<br>regarding the need to set limits on the Kirchners'
<br>misbehavior and the USG's supposed "softness" on the
<br>Kirchners. He argued that the USG's "silence" on the abusive
<br>mistreatment it suffered at the hands of the Kirchners (such
<br>as at the 2005 Mar del Plata Summit of the Americas) had
<br>encouraged more of the same.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Macri also ridiculed the Kirchners for touting an
<br>economic "model" that had left 30% of Argentines in poverty.
<br>"What kind of model is that?" he asked.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Macri said the Kirchners had succeeded in alienating
<br>Washington to the point where Washington did not care what
<br>Argentina (unlike Brazil or Chile) had to say about anything.
<br>The Ambassador sought to disabuse Macri of that notion,
<br>arguing that Washington remained fully committed to deepening
<br>and strengthening relations with Argentina. She pointed out
<br>that Washington was keenly aware of Argentina's position in
<br>the world as an agricultural powerhouse and of Argentine
<br>cooperation, actual and potential. As an example, she cited
<br>Argentina's role in developing satellites to be launched by
<br>NASA as evidence of Washington's appreciation for the
<br>high-tech value that Argentina could bring to bear.
<br>
<br>Macri's Running!
<br>----------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) In discussing agricultural trade, Macri let slip his
<br>
<br>presidential ambitions for 2011. He said beef exports may
<br>not be an issue for the Kirchners (because they want to keep
<br>beef at home), but beef will be an issue for him in a couple
<br>of years (i.e., when he is president).
<br>
<br>New Embassy Building?
<br>---------------------
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Macri also asked about USG plans to relocate the
<br>Embassy and referred to a previous offer to provide a site
<br>for a new office building. (The site is located in downtown
<br>Buenos Aires, less than two miles from the Casa Rosada, in an
<br>old industrial area that the city wishes to develop into an
<br>upscale neighborhood that would include a number of Embassies
<br>-- see 08 Buenos Aires 1564.) The Ambassador and DCM
<br>explained (as we did in late 2008 after consulting with
<br>Washington) that the Department was committed to finding a
<br>site that would conform to new security requirements, but
<br>that the size of the project and more pressing demands
<br>elsewhere meant that it would be several more years before
<br>the project could get underway in Buenos Aires.
<br>
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) The meeting was another reminder of Macri's
<br>directness, his Manichean view of the world, and his
<br>discomfort with the niceties of interpersonal communication
<br>(he cut off the meeting abruptly after about twenty minutes).
<br>These are all qualities that he shares with Nestor Kirchner,
<br>his bitter political rival. Macri's insistence that the USG
<br>publicly reproach the Kirchners for their various
<br>transgressions suggests an unrealistic desire that Washington
<br>do the opposition's bidding. Nonetheless, the mayor remains
<br>one of the top contenders for the 2011 presidential race
<br>(arguably the second most competitive candidate, after Vice
<br>President Julio Cobos). We will continue to engage him
<br>actively as the elections approach.
