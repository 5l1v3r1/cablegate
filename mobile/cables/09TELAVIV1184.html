<br>MINISTER NETANYAHU 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Luis G. Moreno, Reason 1.4 (b),( 
<br>d) 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (S) Summary.  CODEL Ackerman and Casey met separately May 
<br>26 and 27 with Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.  The Prime 
<br>Minister discussed his visit to Washington, focusing on his 
<br>discussions of Iran, a regional approach in support of 
<br>Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, and his approach to the 
<br>Palestinians and settlements, including his opposition to a 
<br>complete freeze on settlement construction.  Netanyahu said 
<br>he was pleased with President Obama's approach to engagement 
<br>with Iran and on a regional component to peacemaking.  On the 
<br>Palestinians, he reiterated his view that the Palestinian 
<br>Authority (PA) must declare its recognition of Israel as a 
<br>Jewish state, and also reviewed his thinking on the 
<br>importance of security for Israelis and his support for 
<br>increased Arab private investment in the West Bank.  On 
<br>settlements, Netanyahu said he would take action against 
<br>illegal outposts and would not build new settlements or 
<br>confiscate more Palestinian land, but he insisted that he 
<br>would not support a complete freeze on construction, and 
<br>noted that his advisers would try to close the gap with the 
<br>U.S. on this issue.  Members of the CODELs pressed Netanyahu 
<br>on the importance of finding ways to strengthen PA President 
<br>Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad, as well as to address 
<br>humanitarian and reconstruction needs in Gaza.  End summary. 
<br> 
<br>Washington Visit 
<br>---------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (S) Prime Minister Netanyahu told CODEL Ackerman that he 
<br>did not feel boxed in politically and that his coalition in 
<br>fact reflects the demands of the Israeli public to address 
<br>their concern about security.  While some argue that 
<br>agreements bring security, Netanyahu said Israel's experience 
<br>of the past fifteen years proved that neither agreements nor 
<br>unilateral withdrawals brought security.  Netanyahu said he 
<br>had told President Obama that while he would not condition 
<br>negotiations with the Palestinians on halting Iran's progress 
<br>toward a nuclear weapon, if Iran obtained such a weapon it 
<br>would destroy any progress made toward peace.  He added that 
<br>Egyptian President Mubarak and Jordanian King Abdullah were 
<br>in complete agreement with him on that point. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (S) For the sake of both security and peace, the first 
<br>task is to stop Iran's nuclear program. Netanyahu noted that 
<br>the President had assured him that by the end of the year, 
<br>the U.S. will decide whether engagement is working and that 
<br>the goal is to stop Iran's program.  The President told him 
<br>that all options remain on the table, a point confirmed by 
<br>Secretaries Clinton and Gates.  Netanyahu said he and Mubarak 
<br>agreed that a nuclear Iran would lead others in the region to 
<br>develop nuclear weapons, resulting in the biggest threat to 
<br>non-proliferation efforts since the Cuban Missile Crisis. 
<br>This "nightmare scenario" is well understood in Washington, 
<br>he said. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (C) Turning to peace efforts, Netanyahu said the 
<br>President is bringing a fresh approach to regional peace 
<br>whereby the Arabs would enhance the Israeli-Palestinian 
<br>track.  It will be especially important to get the Saudis on 
<br>board, he added.  On the two-state solution, Netanyahu noted 
<br>that the President had stressed his support for two states. 
<br>He had told the President that Israelis did not want to rule 
<br>Palestinians.  Netanyahu said he was prepared for 
<br>"arrangements" with the Palestinians that would entail some 
<br>limits on their sovereignty such as no Palestinian army, and 
<br>Israeli control over borders, airspace, and the 
<br>electromagnetic spectrum.  Netanyahu asserted that seventy to 
<br>eighty percent of Israelis are ready to make concessions for 
<br>peace but they do not believe they have a Palestinian partner 
<br>since Hamas is in control of Gaza and Iran has a base on 
<br>Israel's border.  How can there be peace without a new 
<br>situation in Gaza, he asked. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (C) Turning to settlements, Netanyahu noted that he had 
<br>told the President that both Israel and the Palestinians had 
<br>unfulfilled Roadmap commitments.  Without elaborating, he 
<br>noted that there were written and oral understandings between 
<br>President Bush and Prime Ministers Sharon and Olmert on the 
<br>Roadmap.  In Gaza, Israel dismantled twenty-seven settlements 
<br>but got six thousand rockets from Hamas in return. 
<br> 
<br>Support the PA 
<br>-------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (C) Chairman Ackerman commented that President Abbas and 
<br>Prime Minister Fayyad are necessary for progress, and noted 
<br>that both Israel and the U.S. will be in trouble if they are 
<br>replaced.  Something needs to be done to help them stay in 
<br>power.  They need material support but also the promise of 
<br> 
<br>TEL AVIV 00001184  002 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>statehood.  Foreign investment in the West Bank would give a 
<br>real horizon as well.  Netanyahu agreed, saying Gulf Arab 
<br>investors had been successful in transforming their own 
<br>societies and could make a great contribution to the 
<br>Palestinians.  He added that he wanted to bring Gulf 
<br>investors into the West Bank since they would change reality 
<br>for the Palestinians but also give Israelis confidence. 
<br>Ackerman responded that this was a great idea, but it should 
<br>come from Abbas, not Israel.  The more credit Abbas can take 
<br>for steps forward, the better. 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (C) In response to a question about the PA security 
<br>forces' capabilities, Netanyahu commented that he supports 
<br>the PA's desire to keep Hamas at a distance.  A national 
<br>unity government without Hamas' acceptance of the Quartet 
<br>conditions would serve Hamas' interests, adding that Israel 
<br>has a common interest with the PA to prevent a Hamas takeover 
<br>of the West Bank.  Netanyahu said there is a steady flow of 
<br>Iranian weapons to Gaza through Sudan or Syria and then by 
<br>sea, but he said Egypt's performance in stopping the tunnels 
<br>has improved now that Cairo understands that the Iranian arms 
<br>pipeline is a direct threat to Egypt as well. 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (C) On the economic side, Netanyahu said he wants to 
<br>establish a joint plan with the PA to improve conditions in 
<br>the West Bank.  He cited Cyprus as an example of economic 
<br>prosperity leading to reduced political tensions.  Sen. 
<br>Lautenberg pushed Netanyahu to &put Israel,s best face 
<br>forward8 in the West Bank, and to work with the PA on water 
<br>issues, conservation and health, where Israel could 
<br>contribute a great deal and there are many opportunities to 
<br>build cooperation that would benefit people.  Netanyahu 
<br>responded that his ministerial committee on improving the 
<br>lives of Palestinians in the West Bank met earlier in the day 
<br>and that he is committed to overcoming the turf wars and 
<br>excessive caution that have undercut development efforts in 
<br>the West Bank in the past.  He said the GOI is looking at 
<br>creative ideas, such as how to facilitate tourism to Jericho, 
<br>advance projects in water and agriculture, in addition to 
<br>promoting business (note: he estimated that there are 100 
<br>projects Israel is examining in the West Bank).  &It is 
<br>beyond belief8 what can be done in the West Bank, he said, 
<br>but he hoped the PA would engage with Israel on these 
<br>efforts.  Netanyahu added that the fact that there had not 
<br>been any large anti-Israel demonstrations in the West Bank 
<br>during Operation Cast Lead meant that Palestinians in the 
<br>West Bank want a better life, not confrontation with Israel. 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (C) Representative Ellison, noting that he is the first 
<br>Muslim to be elected to Congress, said he visited Gaza in 
<br>February and met with NGO representatives who could deliver 
<br>assistance without the credit going to Hamas.  He urged 
<br>Netanyahu to consider opening the Gaza crossings, adding that 
<br>Gazans he had met told him they want peace and would like to 
<br>get their jobs back in Israel.  Netanyahu responded that he 
<br>is looking at ways to balance Israeli security with enabling 
<br>Gazans to have a normal life.  The flow of money and weapons 
<br>to Hamas remains a problem since Hamas is extending the range 
<br>and payload of the rockets it possesses.  In response to 
<br>Representative Ellison's comment that Israel should allow 
<br>USAID to return to Gaza, Netanyahu said he thought that it 
<br>might be a good thing to have USAID operate in Gaza. 
<br> 
<br>Settlements and Outposts 
<br>------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (C) Netanyahu said that illegal outposts were a legal 
<br>question and his government would enforce the law.  The 
<br>outposts should be removed through dialogue with the GOI if 
<br>possible, but it should be done in any case.  Regarding 
<br>settlements, Netanyahu said he wants to work with the U.S. on 
<br>the basis of the understandings reached with the Bush 
<br>Administration, i.e. that Israel will not build new 
<br>settlements or seize more land, but if families grow, they 
<br>will still have the right to build within existing settlement 
<br>boundaries.  Now Israel is hearing that the U.S. wants no 
<br>construction at all.  Israelis consider this position to be 
<br>unfair, he said.  The question is whether the U.S. is seeking 
<br>a geographic or a demographic restriction on settlements. 
<br> 
<br>¶11.  (C) Netanyahu commented that Israel needs a common 
<br>understanding with the U.S.  The U.S. position should be 
<br>"reasonable," since opposition to a total freeze cuts across 
<br>political parties in Israel.  This is more of an issue with 
<br>the U.S. than with the Palestinians, Netanyahu asserted, 
<br>arguing that the PA will go along if there is an 
<br>understanding between Israel and the U.S.  He noted that 
<br>Israeli officials were meeting with U.S. officials on this 
<br>issue, adding that there could be an understanding if the 
<br>U.S. wants one.  Netanyahu commented that he understood there 
<br>should be no land seizures, but he could not tell settlers 
<br> 
<br>TEL AVIV 00001184  003 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>not to have children.  In response to a question about GOI 
<br>incentives to settlers, Netanyahu's adviser Ron Dermer said 
<br>the Olmert government had already removed them.  Netanyahu 
<br>said this was an issue that Israel could discuss further with 
<br>the U.S. 
<br> 
<br>Iranian Threat 
<br>-------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶12.  (S) Chairman Ackerman said that in his meetings with 
<br>Arab leaders, he found them all concerned about Iran.  They 
<br>said it would helpful to resolve the Palestinian issue, but 
<br>Israel-Palestine is not the main threat to the region. 
<br>Netanyahu, following a similar comment during his meeting 
<br>with CODEL Casey, responded that there are no Arab leaders 
<br>who would tell the U.S. to wait on Iran until there is a 
<br>settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian issue.  Ackerman also 
<br>explained that the U.S. will try engagement in order to 
<br>prevent an unwise and premature use of force.  We will 
<br>tighten sanctions at the same time, for which we need the 
<br>support of the international community, Ackerman explained. 
<br>Netanyahu noted that Ahmadinejad had said he would not stop 
<br>Iran's nuclear program.  President Obama had been clear in 
<br>his comments to Netanyahu that U.S. engagement would be 
<br>results-oriented and not open-ended.  If engagement did not 
<br>work, the U.S. would gain the moral high ground, which would 
<br>help make economic pressure more effective.  Ackerman agreed 
<br>that more pressure was needed and said we need to figure out 
<br>what the Russians and others want.  Netanyahu said that in 
<br>contrast to North Korea, the Iranian nuclear and missile 
<br>programs were direct threats to Israel, Europe and U.S. 
<br>interests in the Gulf, and he emphasized that the program was 
<br>not defensive in nature.  In response to a question from 
<br>Representative Jackson-Lee, Netanyahu encouraged quick action 
<br>on a bill in the Congress to pressure foreign oil companies 
<br>not to sell refined petroleum to Iran.  This might not be 
<br>enough to stop Iran's program but it would send a strong 
<br>signal.  Netanyahu also urged that the U.S. demand that Iran 
<br>stop all uranium enrichment since enrichment is the main 
<br>element of their program.  He commented that Iran might try 
<br>to use the talks with the U.S. to continue or accelerate 
<br>their enrichment process.  Netanyahu cautioned that he was 
<br>skeptical of the idea that the Iranian leadership could 
<br>change.  They have a dangerous worldview, a violent 
<br>theocracy, but it may be possible to move them if they find 
<br>the U.S. strong and determined.  Iran, he commented, is bent 
<br>on becoming a global and not just a regional power. 
<br> 
<br>¶13.  (U) CODELS Ackerman and Casey did not have the 
<br>opportunity to clear this message.
