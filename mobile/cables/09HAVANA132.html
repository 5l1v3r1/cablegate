<br>SUBJECT: ASSESSING THE RISK OF SOCIAL UNREST IN RUSSIA
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador John Beyrle. Reason: 1.4 (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary. The risk of crisis-driven unrest in Russia
<br>remains low and is likely to remain so, at least through the
<br>summer. Public opinion surveys show an up-tick in
<br>dissatisfaction with the country's general direction, but
<br>with no indication that the darkening mood signals an
<br>increased tendency for protest or other signs of active
<br>discontent. Moscow's top sociologists point to deep
<br>wellsprings of trust in Putin, successes in the government's
<br>efforts to limit layoffs, and the Russian "psyche" of
<br>perseverance as explanation for their predictions of relative
<br>social stability over the coming months. Some argue with
<br>justification that society has yet to feel the full effect of
<br>the economic crisis. They predict a moment of truth next
<br>fall, when unemployed (or underemployed) Russians return from
<br>their summer dachas to face continued deprivations and
<br>expected cutbacks in government benefits and support. End
<br>Summary.
<br>
<br>The Public Mood: Darkening but Not Black
<br>----------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Russia's top three polling firms offer a consistent
<br>picture of a society adjusting to the reality of economic
<br>crisis; an increase in general dissatisfaction about the
<br>course of events; but general social stability. Ludmilla
<br>Presnyakova of the Fund for Public Opinion (FOM) provided
<br>data from a February 14-15 survey that showed 58 percent of
<br>respondents considered Russia "in crisis" -- up from 31
<br>percent in late January -- and 34 percent expected the crisis
<br>to last at least a year. The state-controlled VTsIOM company
<br>reported that the number or those who were strongly disturbed
<br>by the economic crisis had increased from 40 percent in
<br>January to 56 percent in February. Further, VTsIOM surveys
<br>found a sharp increase in the number of respondents concerned
<br>about unemployment from 25 percent last year to 61 percent in
<br>February.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Already, economic issues are having a negative impact
<br>on the political arena. Levada Center polling for February
<br>showed a continued downturn in public perceptions about the
<br>direction of the country, with 40 percent of respondents
<br>saying they considered the country moving in the wrong
<br>direction. This compares with only 25 percent in June and 30
<br>percent in November. The economic crisis has also made a
<br>slight dent in Putin's personal popularity according to
<br>Levada polls, with one-fifth of the population not approving
<br>and about 80 percent supporting the Premier. Medvedev's
<br>ratings are seen as a derivative of Putin's and have likewise
<br>dipped in recent weeks. More telling, public approval of the
<br>government (separate from the personalities of the
<br>leadership) has fallen to only 54 percent; 43 percent
<br>disapproved.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Taken in perspective, however, Levada data over the
<br>eight years of the Putin era shows long-standing Russian
<br>skepticism about the government and more measured, though
<br>positive, assessments of Putin. For most of the period from
<br>1999 to 2007, the majority of Russians disapproved of their
<br>government's work, sometimes with as much as a negative 40
<br>percent approval index (the difference between those who
<br>approved vice those who disapproved). Putin's approval index
<br>has enjoyed positive numbers, but varied from less than 40
<br>percent in 2004-2005 to a peak of 80 percent at the time of
<br>the war in Georgia. Levada's numbers suggest that the slide
<br>in public opinion thus far has merely reflected a decrease
<br>from unusually high ratings over the past two years.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Despite the crisis, FOM surveys found little change in
<br>respondents' inclination to take part in protest activities:
<br>from 2005 to the present, the number of those who would
<br>consider the possibility has been stable at around 30 percent
<br>of the population, with fluctuations within the 3 percent
<br>margin of error. Even among the unemployed, only 35 percent
<br>said they would consider joining a protest action, compared
<br>to 28 percent among the population writ large.
<br>
<br>Is Russia Revolutionary?
<br>------------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Many in the political sphere share the sociologists'
<br>skepticism about the potential for social unrest over the
<br>short to medium term. Economist Evgeniy Gontmakher of the
<br>Medvedev-linked Institute of Contemporary Development waved
<br>off suggestions that crisis-linked dissatisfaction would lead
<br>to social upheaval and a threat to the current order. Despite
<br>having published a provocative article hypothesizing a
<br>political crisis emerging from the government's failure to
<br>deal with a localized protest, he argued to us that Russians
<br>remain apolitical, apathetic, and waiting for the government
<br>to take action. Further, Russia's immense size and diversity
<br>
<br>MOSCOW 00000512 002 OF 002
<br>
<br>
<br>are potent roadblocks to the emergence of a nationwide
<br>protest movement, leaving Gontmakher ambivalent about the
<br>risks that economic crisis in and of itself will engender
<br>revolution from below.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Rostislav Turovksiy of the Center for Political
<br>Technologies likewise argued that the current system has deep
<br>wellsprings of social support. Echoing Gontmakher, he told us
<br>that Russia's populace remains deeply conservative and
<br>influenced by the government's propaganda machine, which he
<br>claimed would never permit programming that cast blame on
<br>government policies for the economic crisis. Andrey Kortunov
<br>of the Eurasia Foundation agreed, noting that the Russian
<br>leadership retained significant carrots and sticks;
<br>culturally, he argued, there would also be an initial
<br>willingness to trust the leadership, particularly Putin, by a
<br>populace woefully uninformed about international economics.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) A few of our contacts, however, are less sanguine and
<br>see the potential for mass social unrest growing, with the
<br>risk increasing sharply in the fall. Valeriy Solovei of the
<br>Gorbachev Foundation said his main concern was for the middle
<br>class, which he considered about 25 percent of the
<br>population. The poorer lower class (estimated at 70% of the
<br>population) "had nothing to lose" and would survive economic
<br>hardship by digging their potatoes and drinking the days
<br>away. Oleg Voronin agreed, noting that much of Russian
<br>society would spend the summer at the dacha, with only some
<br>sporadic protests of office workers (perhaps in Moscow) and
<br>some blue collar demonstrations like the coal miners blockade
<br>of the main Siberian rail lines. Next fall, however, when the
<br>Russian government eventually runs out of cash, economic
<br>tensions will rise and give rise to more public displays of
<br>discontent.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Presnyakova sees some logic in the scenario painted by
<br>the "pessimists" Solovei and Voronin. She cited research that
<br>most Russians have sufficient resources to last four to six
<br>months during a crisis, allowing those who have lost their
<br>jobs in 2009 to last through summer. Moreover, she said that
<br>up to half of all Russian families have a dacha plot where
<br>they could grow food supplies for a difficult year. Moreover,
<br>in a February FOM poll only 1 percent of respondents cited
<br>unemployment (being laid off) as the personal impact of the
<br>crisis vice a quarter who suffered pay delays or the 33
<br>percent who cited a reduction in pay or a loss of a bonus.
<br>Presnyakova assessed that this reflected the success of
<br>government pressure on firms to limit unemployment. As the
<br>crisis deepens and the government draws down its reserves,
<br>such measures to limit layoffs are likely to diminish
<br>sharply. Assessments of how Russian society will react to
<br>those coming changes are mixed.
<br>
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) It is difficult to predict the course of events in a
<br>country as large and differentiated as Russia, especially
<br>given the uncertainties of the global economic crisis. We are
<br>inclined to the view that Russia will maintain
<br>socio-political stability through the summer, albeit with the
<br>recognition that localized demonstrations of protest are
<br>possible throughout the country, particularly in the "one
<br>company towns." Without a viable political alternative and
<br>the tandem's control over mass media, the likelihood that
<br>economic discontent can evolve into a political movement
<br>remains low. However, as we will discuss septel, the greater
<br>risk to socio-political stability is that of inter- and
<br>intra-elite conflict, in which one or more of the competing
<br>clans seeks to leverage public discontent to gain advantage.
