<br>Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Arnold A. Chacon for reasons 1.4

<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: A hot issue in the Spanish press since
<br>2005, the detainee transfer flights that allegedly transited
<br>Spain from 2002 until 2006 have once again hit the headlines.
<br>The most recent flurry of reporting began November 30 when
<br>El Pais, Spain's leading newspaper, printed several stories
<br>based on internal GOS documents purporting to relate U.S.
<br>requests in 2002 for permission to use Spanish airports
<br>should an emergency arise on flights transporting terrorism
<br>detainees to Guantanamo. Although GOS officials past and
<br>present continue to deny knowledge of any illegality, this
<br>long-running saga could have implications for our Agreement
<br>on Defense Cooperation (ADC). END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>The Story that Will Not Die
<br>---------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) The Guantanamo detainee flight story has long since
<br>become a press staple in Spain. The story appears on front
<br>pages (starting in El Pais) and disappears every two or three
<br>months. An investigation is underway in a Spanish court,
<br>brought by an NGO which claims illegally detained persons
<br>were transported via Spain. The press reporting almost
<br>invariably mixes so-called "CIA flights" and U.S. military
<br>flights via Rota and Moron (of which there are thousands
<br>annually) indiscriminantly. It also draws heavily on claims
<br>by various NGOs interested in Guantanamo and presents their
<br>allegations as fact (e.g., lists of aircraft tail numbers
<br>from planes alleged to have passed through Spain carrying
<br>detainees). The progress of the case appears desultory and
<br>that translates into a periodic rash of stories each time the
<br>judge receives new information, say from air traffic control
<br>authorities or the Spanish MOD. Naturally, no allowance is
<br>made in the press for the fact that Guantanamo, aside from
<br>being home to the detention facility, is also a U.S. military
<br>base visited by routine logistical flights.
<br>
<br>Leaks
<br>-----
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) The current iteration of the story is the most
<br>virulent so far. It began November 30 when El Pais reported
<br>a document recounting a 2002 meeting between the then-Spanish
<br>MFA Director General for North America and the Embassy's
<br>Political-Military Counselor (NFI) in which the U.S. asked to
<br>use Spain as an emergency landing destination for flights
<br>moving detainees from Afghanistan to Guantanamo. The
<br>newspaper also described a second document from the same MFA
<br>official, addressed to the MOD Secretary General for Defense
<br>Policy, expressing the MFA's willingness to grant the U.S.
<br>request and suggesting use of a "discreet" military airport
<br>such as Moron. In a related article December 3, El Pais
<br>published a February 2007 letter from the Spanish President
<br>of the joint Permanent Committee which manages implementation
<br>of the ADC, asking the U.S. section to confirm that the U.S.
<br>was in compliance with Article 25.2 of the ADC with respect
<br>to U.S. military flights to and from Guantanamo (that article
<br>exempts from blanket flight clearances any plane carrying
<br>persons or cargo that would be controversial for Spain). The
<br>newspaper also published the U.S. section response, which was
<br>in the affirmative. (Note: In March 2007, the MOD decided
<br>that all flights to and from Guantanamo would require
<br>individual clearances; that is the procedure in use today).
<br>
<br>Know Nothings
<br>-------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) Trying to get ahead of the story, FM Moratinos
<br>announced December 1 the formation of an independent
<br>investigative team including the Chiefs of Staff to the FM,
<br>the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and the
<br>Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs as well as the
<br>FM's parliamentary advisor. On December 2, Moratinos
<br>confirmed press reports the investigative team has not been
<br>able to locate the original of the 2002 document described in
<br>paragraph 1 (although El Pais has printed a facsimile). This
<br>has only added to the government's embarrassment.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) President Zapatero and his cabinet have let it be
<br>
<br>MADRID 00001280 002.2 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>known that they had no knowledge of any arrangements the
<br>previous administration (that of Jose Maria Aznar) might have
<br>made with the U.S. This tactic could be effective but is
<br>blunted by allegations the flights continued into 2006, well
<br>into Zapatero's first term. Given the Socialists'
<br>consistent, outspoken anti-Guantanamo line, it would be a
<br>political disaster if they were shown to have winked at
<br>detainee flights. It would be only somewhat less damaging if
<br>they were perceived to be so incompetent they did not notice
<br>the flights. Moratinos has denied any knowledge. Two former
<br>Zapatero MODs, current President of Congress Jose Bono and
<br>current senior Socialist Party congressional spokesman Jose
<br>Antonio Alonso, have said they knew of no illegal U.S.
<br>activity in Spain. The opposition Popular Party (PP -- the
<br>party Aznar led) has accused the Zapatero administration of
<br>leaking documents in an effort to discredit them and to
<br>distract public attention from Zapatero's alleged mishandling
<br>of the ailing Spanish economy. The PP has also pointed out
<br>that of two of the alleged flights occurred under Aznar and
<br>nine came under Zapatero's presidency. PP leader Mariano
<br>Rajoy has told the press he knew nothing about the flights,
<br>although he was First Vice President in Aznar's government at
<br>the time of the alleged agreement. A unsubstantiated rumor
<br>claims the leaker is the head of Spain's National
<br>Intelligence Center who is allegedly trying to pressure his
<br>former mentor Bono into supporting a renewal of his term as
<br>director. We put little credence in such rumors, but they
<br>give a sense of how heated this has become. Adding to
<br>Zapatero's discomfort, the small but noisy far-left party
<br>(United Left) is in full cry over the story.
<br>
<br>Subpoenas?
<br>----------
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) The prosecutor handling the related court case
<br>indicated last year that there was no plan to request
<br>information from the USG (ref a). However, the latest round
<br>of stories has included speculation that the court might seek
<br>testimony from Aznar and members of his administration as
<br>well as from U.S. Embassy officials. We have received no
<br>official notification of any such requests, and consider it
<br>unlikely.
<br>
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Beyond the fact that it sells newspapers, there are a
<br>variety of reasons for this story,s longevity. Although
<br>anti-Americanism in Spain is more theoretical than practical
<br>(the Spanish people fundamentally like the U.S. and want
<br>strong relations, and the Spanish government is anxious to
<br>establish closer ties with the incoming U.S. Administration),
<br>there remains an important segment in the media that is
<br>old-school European left. More importantly, the
<br>left-of-center press here enjoys bashing Aznar and his party,
<br>especially for their support for the war in Iraq.
<br>Additionally, although itself left-of-center, El Pais has its
<br>differences with Zapatero and may not mind inflicting pain on
<br>him as well as Aznar. Neither is El Pais very fond of
<br>Moratinos.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Whatever the motive, the continual media muddling of
<br>so-called "CIA flights" and U.S. military flights is
<br>unhelpful. The ADC provides us the extremely valuable use of
<br>two military bases in southern Spain midway between the
<br>continental U.S. and the theaters of operation in Afghanistan
<br>and Iraq. To the extent our ADC -- which generally receives
<br>little public attention in Spain -- is hauled onto the front
<br>pages in connection with the detention facility at
<br>Guantanamo, we run the risk of seeing political support for
<br>the ADC and our mil-mil relationship undermined. By
<br>unfortunate coincidence, the ADC was already in the press in
<br>recent weeks thanks to MOD Chacon,s repeated references to
<br>her hope that the U.S. would elevate it to the level of a
<br>treaty (septel).
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) In general, we have taken the approach that the less
<br>said by us to the press on the overflight topic, the better.
<br>The MFA North America Desk has told us in the past that they
<br>strongly prefer the Embassy not say anything, fearing it
<br>might stir the pot. In any case, our ability to beat down
<br>this story is constrained by the fact that we do not
<br>ourselves know, factually, what might have transpired five or
<br>six years ago as the battles in Afghanistan and Iraq began
<br>
<br>MADRID 00001280 003.2 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>yielding large numbers of potentially dangerous terrorist
<br>detainees and unlawful combatants. Naturally, we are not
<br>going to answer questions on the activities of intelligence
<br>agencies, so in any conversation about these issues we run
<br>the risk of appearing less than transparent and thus seeming
<br>to confirm the media,s worst insinuations. When we do speak
<br>publicly on the issue, our mantra is that we have not
<br>violated Spanish law and have complied fully with the ADC.
<br>Needless to say, we decline to comment on any leaked internal
<br>GOS documents. We also try at every opportunity to make the
<br>larger point about the war on terror and the very difficult
<br>choices that are faced when the U.S. captures suspected
<br>terrorists on foreign battlefields. Frankly, this is a
<br>losing argument with a Spanish public that -- although
<br>attuned to the dangers of terrorism -- largely rejects the
<br>muscular U.S. approach to fighting it overseas.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Thus far, the MOD and MFA have done a reasonably good
<br>job in their public affairs efforts of making clear that they
<br>do not believe we have violated the ADC. The MOD issued a
<br>December 2 statement saying it knew of no U.S. military
<br>flights that were either illegal or in violation of our
<br>bilateral agreements (this echoes what MOD officials have
<br>told us privately -- e.g. ref b). However, we have no
<br>illusions. Politicians are not going to throw themselves on
<br>a grenade to protect a predecessor government they despise.
<br>More than anything, these stories are directed at Aznar and
<br>his party, and the damage to U.S. interests is in some
<br>measure collateral.
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Our guess is that the story will continue to rear its
<br>head every month or two for the foreseeable future. It is
<br>irresistible copy for Spanish editors, and Aznar is the
<br>left,s favorite bogeyman. The court case, winding its way
<br>slowly through the system, also provides periodic
<br>opportunities to revive it. Also, the release in the U.S. at
<br>some point in the future of information relating Guantanamo
<br>and Spain would certainly generate renewed press interest
<br>here. Baring a categorical statement from the USG that no
<br>detainees passed through Spain -- and we understand that
<br>might be undesirable from a policy standpoint even if
<br>factually correct -- nothing but time is going to make this
<br>go away.
