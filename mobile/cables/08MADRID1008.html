<br>SUBJECT: REPSOL CONFIRMS NO PLANS WITH IRAN AND INDICATES
<br>INTEREST IN IRAQ
<br>
<br>REF: A. MADRID 836
<br>¶B. MADRID 492
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre for reasons 1.4(b) and (d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) Ambassador Aguirre met September 17 with Repsol
<br>General Counsel and Secretary to the Board Luis Suarez de
<br>Lezo. During the discussion, Suarez de Lezo advised the
<br>Ambassador that, after Repsol had allowed to expire its
<br>option on its block in Iran's South Pars field (reftels), it
<br>had no remaining contractual relationships with Iran. (Note:
<br>A press report (ref b) at the time of the decision earlier
<br>this year had said that Repsol was seeking concessions for
<br>blocks 23 and 24, which would be developed in the next
<br>decade.) Suarez de Lezo said Repsol was not planning to
<br>engage in operations in Iran in the near future. Saurez de
<br>Lezo added, however, that Repsol would continue to maintain
<br>its contacts and relationships in Iran in order to be ready
<br>if and when Iran returns to good standing in the future. He
<br>reiterated once again that despite maintaining these
<br>contacts, Repsol would not engage in activities with Iran.
<br>The Ambassador applauded Repsol's decision, further stressing
<br>the importance of not entering into energy agreements with
<br>Iran.
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) Separately, the Ambassador explained that recent
<br>meetings with S/I Ambassador Satterfield indicated that
<br>Iraq's improving security situation and growing openness to
<br>private investment could be an opportunity for those
<br>companies interested in developing Iraq's oil and gas
<br>potential, especially if the Iraqis moved from small,
<br>piecemeal technical service contracts to a more market-based
<br>approach with production-sharing agreements. The Ambassador
<br>asked Suarez de Lezo whether Repsol would be interested in
<br>exploring potential operations in Iraq. Suarez de Lezo
<br>replied that Repsol would be very interested and committed to
<br>following up with Post. When he does, Post will put him in
<br>contact with the appropriate POC at Embassy Baghdad.
