<br>Classified By: POLITICAL COUNSELOR ROBIN D. MEYER,
<br>FOR REASON 1.4(D)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Over the past week, President Chavez and
<br>his supporters have stepped up attacks against two opposition
<br>governors, Cesar Perez Vivas (Tachira) and Henrique Capriles
<br>Radonski (Miranda). Chavez is blaming Perez Vivas for
<br>several highly-publicized violent incidents along the
<br>Colombian border (septel), alleging that he has ties to
<br>Colombian paramilitary groups. The Comptroller General
<br>agreed to investigate corruption charges against Capriles
<br>brought by Chavez's United Socialist Party of Venezuela
<br>(PSUV), which could result in a 15-year disqualification from
<br>public office. PSUV youth members and National Assembly (AN)
<br>Deputies have called for investigations of a number of other
<br>opposition figures on allegations of corruption and
<br>espionage. These attacks are akin to the smear campaign
<br>Chavez waged before the past two elections to discredit or
<br>disqualify particularly popular or vocal opposition figures.
<br>End Summary.
<br>
<br>---------------------------------------------
<br>CHAVEZ ALLEGES PEREZ VIVAS' PARAMILITARY TIES
<br>---------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) On November 3, Chavez publicly linked Tachira
<br>Governor Cesar Perez Vivas with violence along the border
<br>with Colombia, alleging that paramilitaries tied to the
<br>Governor had been responsible for the November 2 killing of
<br>two members of the Venezuelan National Guard. Chavez
<br>announced that Perez Vivas "is committed to the paramilitary
<br>plan and we cannot permit it... heed the consequences. There
<br>was one person who went running for Peru, (Perez Vivas) is
<br>going to have to do the same." (Notes: Since Perez Vivas'
<br>election in 2008, Chavez has repeatedly claimed he was linked
<br>to the Colombian paramilitaries. Manuel Rosales, former
<br>Maracaibo Mayor and 2006 Presidential candidate, sought
<br>political asylum in Lima in April 2009 after being charged
<br>with corruption. End Notes.) Chavez also suggested that the
<br>opposition Mayor of Tachira's capital city, San Cristobal,
<br>Monica de Mendez, should respond before a tribunal, just like
<br>the Governor." In a press conference in San Cristobal the
<br>same day, Vice President and Minister of Defense Ramon
<br>Carrizalez echoed Chavez's comments and said the Governor has
<br>"one foot in jail" and pledged he would fight against Perez
<br>Vivas' "dirty war."
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) Perez Vivas responded November 4 that the charges
<br>were part of a "file" the GBRV had fabricated, with the
<br>assistance of Cuban intelligence services, to discredit him.
<br>He asserted to the local press that the central government
<br>was blaming paramilitary groups for the recent deaths in
<br>Tachira to "protect Colombian guerrillas" that had taken
<br>refuge in the area. He added that Chavez was trying to
<br>remove him from power, asserting that the GBRV "doesn't have
<br>a way to eliminate me ... so they are in their laboratories
<br>looking for what they can fabricate to blame me."
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- -----------
<br>National Assembly Investigates the Opposition as "Spies"
<br>--------------------------------------------- -----------
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) On November 3, the AN approved a proposal
<br>submitted by AN Vice President Saul Ortega to investigate
<br>travel to Colombia by key opposition leaders, alleging that
<br>they have been involved in espionage against Venezuela. The
<br>named individuals are: Miranda State Governor Henrique
<br>Capriles Radonski, Tachira State Governor Cesar Perez Vivas,
<br>former Ambassador Milos Alcalay, former Chacao Mayor Leopoldo
<br>Lopez, Mayor of Greater Caracas Antonio Ledezma, former
<br>student leader Yon Goicochea, and exiled opposition leader
<br>Manuel Rosales. Ortega asserted that the opposition's "unity
<br>table" had been in Colombia in the past few months and days
<br>and that the former head of Colombia's Administrative
<br>Department of Security (DAS) had said they were plotting
<br>against the Venezuelan government.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----------
<br>Comptroller Pursues Corruption Charges against Capriles
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----------
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) On October 27, the General Comptroller
<br>("Contraloria General") accepted corruption charges brought
<br>against Miranda State Governor Henrique Capriles Radonski.
<br>
<br>CARACAS 00001417 002.2 OF 002
<br>
<br>
<br>The charges were levied on August 26 by the PSUV based on
<br>Capriles' tenure as Mayor of Baruta municipality (part of
<br>greater Caracas) between 2000-2008. The PSUV alleged
<br>"financial irregularities" involving several companies owned
<br>by Capriles and his family, including purported tax evasion
<br>related to the sale of two plots of land valued at USD 1.8
<br>million. PSUV representatives claimed October 27 that
<br>Capriles would have to present himself before the
<br>Comptroller's Office the following week. (Note: These
<br>"administrative" charges are distinct from the legal case
<br>brought against Capriles for his alleged involvement in
<br>violence outside the Cuban Embassy during the 2002 coup
<br>against Chavez. Although the latter case could be reopened,
<br>post is not aware that any legal steps have been taken to do
<br>so. End Note.)
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Lawyer Rafael Chavero told Poloff on November 2 that
<br>the next step would be for the Comptroller to begin an
<br>administrative investigation into the case against Capriles,
<br>which could result in a determination of an "administrative
<br>irregularity." He said that if Capriles was found
<br>responsible, the Comptroller General could "disqualify"
<br>("inhabilitar") Capriles for up to 15 years without the need
<br>for any court decision. He noted that this power has been
<br>used extensively by the GBRV in the past -- most famously to
<br>disqualify over 200 candidates in advance of the 2008
<br>municipal and gubernatorial elections -- and called it a
<br>"fundamental tool used (by the GBRV) to remove political
<br>adversaries from the game."
<br>
<br>------------------------------------------
<br>...AND POSSIBLY AGAINST LEDEZMA AND GARCIA
<br>------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) Several youth members of the PSUV urged the
<br>Comptroller's Office on October 30 to open an investigation
<br>into Mayor of Greater Caracas Antonio Ledezma's trip to
<br>Brazil. According to the state-owned media, the trip cost
<br>USD 20,000. The PSUV representatives asserted that an
<br>investigation was necessary "to explain to the country where
<br>these resources were taken from, in order (for Ledezma) to
<br>carry out political tourism... throughout Latin America and
<br>Europe." Ledezma has claimed the funding for his mid-October
<br>trip to Brazil, Spain, and France came from private sources
<br>(reftel).
<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU) PSUV officials claimed October 27 to also have
<br>corruption evidence against opposition political party
<br>"Podemos" founder and AN Deputy Ismael Garcia. Although
<br>Garcia enjoys immunity from prosecution as an AN Deputy, that
<br>immunity could be lifted through a vote in the AN.
<br>
<br>-------
<br>COMMENT
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Of all the charges, those against Perez Vivas appear
<br>to be the most threatening, given the increased tensions with
<br>Colombia and Chavez's pledge that the Governor could be
<br>forced into exile. The charges against Capriles, one of the
<br>opposition's most popular figures, smack of political revenge
<br>due to Capriles' long-running rivalry with his predecessor
<br>and Chavez ally Diosdado Cabello and his repeated calls for a
<br>corruption investigation into Cabello's gubernatorial
<br>administration. Disqualifying Capriles from running for
<br>public office in the foreseeable future could both derail his
<br>political career and intimidate other opposition officials.
