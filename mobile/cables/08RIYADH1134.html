<br>SUBJECT: SAUDIS ON IRAN REF UPCOMING NAM FM MEETING 
<br> 
<br>REF: A. SECSTATE 74879 
<br>     ¶B. RIYADH 43 
<br>Classified By: Charge' d'Affaires Michael Gfoeller for 
<br>reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (S) On July 21, Pol Counselor delivered demarche on the 
<br>upcoming Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) Foreign Ministers meeting 
<br>scheduled for Tehran from July 27-30 (Reftel A) to Saudi MFA 
<br>Deputy Director for Western Affairs Department Mojahid Ali 
<br>Alwahbi. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S) Alwahbi informed us that Saudi Minister of State for 
<br>Foreign Affairs (MFA Deputy Secretary equivalent) Dr. Nizar 
<br>bin Obaid Madani would lead the Saudi delegation.  He assured 
<br>us Saudi Arabia did not want the NAM meeting to become an 
<br>Iranian propaganda event, adding he had seen the proposed 
<br>agenda and did not expect it to develop in such a manner. 
<br>Alwahbi agreed Iran's continued nuclear enrichment was a 
<br>grave SAG concern with regional security implications (Reftel 
<br>B). 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S) Alwahbi strongly advised against taking military 
<br>action to neutralize Iran's program.  Rather, establishing a 
<br>US-Iranian dialogue was the best course of action, asserting 
<br>that the USG opening an Interest Section or re-opening our 
<br>Embassy in Tehran would be positive step.  Alwahbi was 
<br>heartened by the USG's initiative for Under Secretary Burns 
<br>to meet with the Iranians last week in Geneva.  He added 
<br>that, in his view, Iran's position was "shifting" and wanted 
<br>to avoid escalation of tensions.  He noted his belief that 
<br>the Russians had recently been effectively pressuring Iran to 
<br>be less provocative.  Alwahbi concluded that he expected Iran 
<br>to keep tensions relatively low at least until after the US 
<br>presidential election. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (S) COMMENT.  These comments are typical of Saudi MFA 
<br>bureaucrats who take a pacific stance towards Iran, but 
<br>diverge significantly from the more bellicose advice we have 
<br>gotten from senior Saudi royals.  END COMMENT.
