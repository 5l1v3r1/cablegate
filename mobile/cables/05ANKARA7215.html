<br> 
<br>¶1.  (C) Summary:  Despite media reports and opposition rumors 
<br>of splits among PM Erdogan's Justice and Development Party's 
<br>(AKP) 357 parliamentarians, the group remains intact )- for 
<br>now.  Among AKP MPs, there are distinctive pious, pragmatic 
<br>and nationalist currents, with crosscutting personal 
<br>loyalties.  Recent events in Turkey's heavily-Kurdish 
<br>southeast have heightened tensions between AKP,s 
<br>Kurdish-origin MPs and the rest of the parliamentary group. 
<br>While AKP MPs, numbers may slowly erode over the next year 
<br>(ref A), a major split is unlikely as long as AKP -- and in 
<br>particular PM Erdogan -- retain power and popularity.  End 
<br>Summary. 
<br> 
<br>Despite Wishful Thinking, AKP Not Crumbling Yet 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -- 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (C) Over the past year, the Turkish press has repeatedly 
<br>predicted open splits in the 357-member AKP parliamentary 
<br>group.  While AKP has ideological and personality-based fault 
<br>lines, there appears to be little chance of a major split 
<br>while AKP remains Turkey,s number one party and Erdogan the 
<br>country,s most popular politician.  Even Ankara AKP MP 
<br>Ersonmez Yarbay, a maverick frequently openly critical of his 
<br>own party, downplayed to us the rumors of party splits, 
<br>saying they have been fueled by the opposition to force early 
<br>elections. 
<br> 
<br>AKP,s Ideological Currents 
<br>-------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C) AKP,s parliamentary group is composed of politicians 
<br>with widely differing viewpoints.  There are three main 
<br>ideological currents:  pious, nationalist and pragmatic. 
<br>Most AKP MPs do not fall neatly into any one category, and 
<br>personal loyalties crosscut ideology, mostly among pious MPs. 
<br> 
<br>Pious 
<br>----- 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (C) Almost all AKP MPs are religiously observant to some 
<br>degree; for example, the vast majority fast during Ramadan. 
<br>However, there is a large and distinctively more pious group 
<br>of MPs, comprising former members of the banned Islamist 
<br>Virtue (Fazilet) Party, former members of the National View 
<br>Islamist youth group, and members of a wide range of 
<br>(officially banned) Muslim brotherhoods.  Most of AKP,s top 
<br>leaders fall into this group:  PM Erdogan, DPM/FM Abdullah 
<br>Gul, parliament Speaker Arinc, Vice Speaker Alptekin (former 
<br>PM and Islamic Saadet Party head Erbakan's right-hand man) 
<br>and all five of AKP,s parliamentary whips.  Pious MPs 
<br>generally represent the central Anatolian heartland, speak no 
<br>English, and have traveled little. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) While most Turkish Islamists oppose the EU, AKP,s 
<br>Islamist MPs toe the AKP line and support it, albeit less 
<br>enthusiastically since October 3.  Typical of Turkish 
<br>Islamists, they dislike Turkey,s military and have no ties 
<br>to it other than their required military service.  Attitudes 
<br>about the U.S. vary widely, from friendly to suspicious, but 
<br>most favor better ties with the Muslim world.  Although the 
<br>GOT, under Erdogan,s leadership, has taken a politically 
<br>courageous public stand favoring privatization and foreign 
<br>investment, many pious MPs oppose both. 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (C) AKP,s pious MPs are widely rumored to be deeply 
<br>unhappy about PM Erdogan,s inability to ease restrictions on 
<br>the wearing of headscarves and on religious schools. 
<br>However, since AKP came to power in November 2002, no AKP MP 
<br>has resigned and gone over to the Happiness (Saadet) Party, 
<br>on AKP's Islamist flank. 
<br> 
<br>Nationalists 
<br>------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (C) It is hard to find a Turk who is not nationalistic. 
<br>Yet a significant number of AKP MPs (as many as 50, according 
<br>to one former MP), many of them former members of the 
<br>ultra-nationalist National Action Party (MHP) or center-right 
<br>True Path Party (DYP), are strong nationalists, even by 
<br>Turkish standards.  This group includes Justice Minister and 
<br>party spokesman Cemil Cicek, Deputy PM Abdullatif Sener, 
<br>State Minister Kursad Tuzmen, and parliament Vice Speaker 
<br>Sadik Yakut. 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (C) Among AKP MPs, nationalists take the hardest line 
<br>against &concessions8 to the EU and on Cyprus.  MFA 
<br>officials have told us on several occasions that the GOT is 
<br>delaying bringing the Ankara Agreement extension protocol to 
<br>parliament for ratification out of concern for the reaction 
<br>of nationalist AKP MPs (ref B).  Nationalist AKP MPs are 
<br>deeply suspicious about the motives of Turkey,s ethnic Kurds 
<br>and were vocal critics of PM Erdogan,s August declaration in 
<br>Diyarbakir that Turkey has a &Kurdish problem.8  Like their 
<br>pious colleagues, nationalists, attitudes about the U.S. 
<br>vary widely, from friendly to suspicious.  However, even 
<br>pro-U.S. nationalists become extremely prickly at any 
<br>perceived U.S. slight to Turkish national honor. 
<br> 
<br>Pragmatists 
<br>----------- 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (C) AKP,s pragmatic MPs generally speak English, are 
<br>foreign-educated, and tend to be better-traveled than their 
<br>colleagues.  They often come from large cosmopolitan areas, 
<br>particularly Ankara or Istanbul; some were previously members 
<br>of the center-right Motherland Party (ANAP).  Three of AKP,s 
<br>five vice chairs, who frequently deal with foreigners, are 
<br>from the pragmatic wing:  Bulent Gedikli, Reha Denemec and 
<br>Saban Disli.  All are U.S-educated and represent either 
<br>Istanbul or Ankara.  The same is true for pragmatic Erdogan 
<br>translator and foreign policy advisor Egemen Bagis, who 
<br>accompanies the PM on his trips to Europe and the U.S. 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (C) Although the pragmatic MPs are often AKP,s most 
<br>visible face to foreigners, they have less influence inside 
<br>AKP than their pious and nationalist colleagues.  In early 
<br>2005, there were signs of frustration among AKP,s moderates, 
<br>when a spate of AKP MP resignations went mostly to ANAP. 
<br>Culture Minister Mumcu, AKP,s highest-profile resignation 
<br>who went on become ANAP,s Chairman, said publicly he had 
<br>only felt like a &guest8 in AKP (ref C). 
<br> 
<br>¶11.  (C) Erdogan can ill afford to lose the pragmatists.  In 
<br>addition to giving AKP a reasonable, big-tent image that 
<br>plays well in the U.S. and Europe, AKP,s pragmatists are 
<br>links to Istanbul and Ankara elites.  These MPs are AKP,s 
<br>friendliest face toward the U.S. (Bagis heads parliament,s 
<br>Turkey/U.S Friendship Committee), and most receptive to 
<br>liberal political and open market economic reforms needed for 
<br>EU accession. 
<br> 
<br>Crosscutting Personal Loyalties 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶12.  (C) AKP MPS are as divided by personality as by 
<br>politics, but personality-based fault lines crosscut 
<br>ideological ones.  PM Erdogan is the glue that holds AKP 
<br>together; a chunk of AKP MPs were part of Erdogan,s team 
<br>when he was Istanbul mayor and have followed him onto the 
<br>national stage.  They include Finance Minister Unakitan, 
<br>Transportation Minister Yildirim, State Minister Cubukcu, AKP 
<br>whip Irfan Gunduz, and Erdogan speechwriter Huseyin Besli. 
<br>All are personally pious or, in Cubukcu,s case, at least 
<br>have consistently supported positions of the party,s pious 
<br>wing.  Cubukcu, a female, was one of the few MPs who publicly 
<br>supported Erdogan,s 2004 proposal to re-criminalize adultery. 
<br> 
<br>¶13.  (C) Erdogan has consistently protected all three 
<br>"Istanbul" Ministers despite repeated calls for their 
<br>resignation.  Many other AKP MPs profess staunch loyalty to 
<br>&Tayyip Bey8 and seek to stay close to him.  One contact 
<br>suggests that Erdogan's strategy is to keep subordinates 
<br>competing with each other for his attention so they are too 
<br>busy to be a threat to him. 
<br> 
<br>¶14.  (C) DPM/FM Gul remains Erdogan,s chief political rival 
<br>within AKP.  Their differences are not ideological ) Gul and 
<br>Erdogan are both pious ) but spring from Gul,s ambitions 
<br>for greater power.  Gul, who represents the parliamentary 
<br>faction of the banned Virtue Party, has a small, quiet 
<br>following among AK MPs that includes whip Salih Kapusuz (from 
<br>Gul,s home town of Kayseri), former AKP public relations 
<br>vice chair Murat Mercan (sacked for incompetence by Erdogan 
<br>earlier this year) and Taner Yildiz (also from Kayseri). 
<br> 
<br>¶15.  (C) Parliament Speaker Arinc is AKP,s third leading 
<br>personality and potential future rival to Erdogan.  However, 
<br>Arinc is well behind Gul in influence and, according to our 
<br>contacts, currently without a significant group of MP 
<br>loyalists. 
<br> 
<br>AKP's Kurdish MPs 
<br>----------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶16.  (C) About 60 AKP MPs, mostly from Turkey,s southeast, 
<br>are of Kurdish origin; Political and Legal Affairs Vice Chair 
<br>Dengir Mir Firat is AKP's most visible Kurdish MP.  The Kurds 
<br>who joined AKP and were elected to parliament tend to be 
<br>pious, stressing the common bonds among all Muslims over 
<br>Kurdish nationalism.  (The strongest Kurdish nationalists ran 
<br>from the pro-Kurdish Democratic People,s Party (DEHAP) in 
<br>2002 elections and failed to enter parliament because DEHAP 
<br>did not cross the ten percent electoral threshold.)  One 
<br>former Kurdish-origin MP, himself pious, has consistently 
<br>told us even he considers AKP,s Kurdish MPs extraordinarily 
<br>passive on Kurdish issues. 
<br> 
<br>¶17.  (C) Yet recent events in the southeast, including AKP 
<br>nationalists' reaction against PM Erdogan,s August &Kurdish 
<br>problem8 speech in Diyarbakir and alleged Jandarma 
<br>involvement in a November bombing in the southeastern town of 
<br>Semdinli, have created tension between AKP,s Kurdish-origin 
<br>MPs and the rest of the parliamentary group.  An Ankara 
<br>provincial AKP official told us recently that tension with 
<br>AKP,s Kurdish-origin MPs has infected AKP's pious wing, 
<br>weakening it relative to other AKP factions. 
<br> 
<br>¶18.  (C) Comment:  AKP's parliamentary strength, so far, 
<br>springs from Erdogan's ability to keep such a diverse group 
<br>of MPs united, and the lack of any viable opposition.  The 
<br>question is whether Erdogan can continue to keep the 
<br>parliamentary group together without turning AKP into an 
<br>internally-undemocratic, personality-based party in the 
<br>classic Turkish tradition.  AKP,s opposition will eventually 
<br>come from inside AKP itself.  However, for now, Erodgan 
<br>appears well in control and there is no viable political 
<br>alternative for dissatisfied AKP MPs.  End Comment.
