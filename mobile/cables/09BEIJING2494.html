<br> 
<br>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Aubrey Carlson. 
<br>Reasons 1.4 (b/d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY:  China is biding its time until the political 
<br>crisis in Iran reaches a clearer resolution and the 
<br>Ahmadinejad government consolidates power, and will signal 
<br>its renewed engagement by sending a high-level delegation to 
<br>Tehran once the political situation has been resolved, 
<br>according to an MFA official.  Our contact reaffirmed China's 
<br>commitment to the P5-plus-1 process and assessed that Iran is 
<br>attempting to keep the door to negotiation with the United 
<br>States open despite the turmoil surrounding the June 
<br>election, but cautioned that a complete halt to uranium 
<br>enrichment is an unattainable goal.  China continues to urge 
<br>Iran to respond positively to the P5-plus-1 offer for talks, 
<br>and these entreaties have been passed directly to Supreme 
<br>Leader Khamenei.  Iran reportedly requested to upgrade its 
<br>relationship with Beijing to a "strategic partnership," but 
<br>China refused.  A Communist Party official told us that the 
<br>CCP is seeking to increase its relations with six major 
<br>political parties and factions in Iran and deepen its 
<br>understanding of U.S. policy in the Middle East.  He repeated 
<br>China's standard position on the Iran nuclear issue and 
<br>suggested that the U.S. offer economic incentives to persuade 
<br>the Iranians to enter into talks on the nuclear issue.  He 
<br>dismissed concerns that negative perceptions in the Middle 
<br>East of China after the July violence in Xinjiang province 
<br>would affect China's diplomacy with Iran.  END SUMMARY. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) PolOff discussed Iran-China relations with MFA West 
<br>Asian Affairs Department Iran Division Deputy Director Ni 
<br>Ruchi August 31.  In a separate meeting the same day, Chinese 
<br>Communist Party (CCP) Central Committee International Liaison 
<br>Department (CCID) Third Bureau (West Asia and North Africa) 
<br>Director Wu Baocai gave PolOff the Party's perspective on 
<br>Iran and the nuclear issue. 
<br> 
<br>Holding Back Bilaterally until Political Dust Settles 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------- 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) MFA Iran Division Deputy Director Ni said that the 
<br>political turmoil in Iran had yet to settle and that China 
<br>was still waiting for the situation to calm further before 
<br>re-engaging fully in bilateral relations.  He argued that the 
<br>internal divisions that had played out in the June 
<br>presidential elections had existed well before the violent 
<br>aftermath of the June election.  China had been aware of the 
<br>potential for conflict among those divisions to spill into 
<br>the street and had taken a cautious approach before the 
<br>election.  He said that the Chinese government understood 
<br>that the election was a strong indication of deep-seated 
<br>divisions within the Iranian government, but stressed that 
<br>the contested election had not fundamentally undermined the 
<br>current government and that China would continue with its 
<br>normal engagement with Tehran. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) China would signal its re-engagement, Ni reported, 
<br>with a high-level delegation to Tehran, but there was no 
<br>timetable for such a visit yet because the leadership in 
<br>Tehran was still fully focused on consolidating power.  He 
<br>noted that during his mid-August visit to Iran, protestors 
<br>had continued to take to the streets to express 
<br>dissatisfaction with the election.  Ni reaffirmed China's 
<br>commitment to the P5-plus-1 process, stressing that the U.S. 
<br>and China not only had common interests in Iran, but the 
<br>scope of this common interest was increasing. 
<br> 
<br>Iran Keeping the Door Open? 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) Ni said that China had taken note of efforts by the 
<br>Iranian government to keep a path open to direct negotiations 
<br>despite the ongoing political turmoil.  He claimed that 
<br>Tehran had refrained from overplaying its accusations of the 
<br>U.S. role in the election turmoil, preferring to point the 
<br>finger at European countries, indicating that the Iranian 
<br>leadership was interested in maintaining the possibility of 
<br>direct talks.  Ni said that the election had caused the 
<br>Iranian leadership to reexamine seriously its foreign policy, 
<br>particularly on the nuclear issue, adding that Iran's nuclear 
<br>development had suffered technical setbacks recently, which 
<br>had also forced the leadership to consider how to move 
<br>forward. 
<br> 
<br>China Lobbying but Total Halt to Enrichment Unattainable 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) Ni reported that China continued to urge Iran at every 
<br>level of their engagement to respond positively to the 
<br>P53-plus-1 offer of direct talks and cease uranium enrichment 
<br> 
<br>BEIJING 00002494  002 OF 002 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>activities.  He said that Chinese leaders had pointed out to 
<br>their Iranian counterparts on many occasions that the United 
<br>States had shown "restraint" in its public comments during 
<br>the June election aftermath, and that Iran was missing an 
<br>important opportunity by refusing to respond to the P5-plus-1 
<br>offer.  Ni said that China's message encouraging greater 
<br>engagement had been passed directly to Supreme Leader 
<br>Khamenei.  He cautioned that Tehran would not be able to 
<br>respond positively to P5-plus-1 overtures until it had 
<br>reinforced its position at home, and that a "100-percent" 
<br>halt to uranium enrichment had become an unattainable goal. 
<br>Ni said that China continued to believe that fresh sanctions 
<br>would be ineffective in persuading Iran to cease enrichment 
<br>activities and would be counter-productive by increasing the 
<br>unity of the various factions in Iran behind the nuclear 
<br>program and the current government.  Ni argued that the 
<br>regime in Iran would emerge from the crisis in a weakened 
<br>position and thus more likely to negotiate with the P5-plus-1 
<br>on the nuclear issue. 
<br> 
<br>Iran Seeks "Strategic Partnership" with an Unwilling PRC 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) Ni said that Iran had requested that Beijing upgrade 
<br>its relationship with Tehran, presumably to counter Western 
<br>pressure, by lobbying Beijing to label its relationship with 
<br>Iran a "strategic partnership" as it does for Russia and 
<br>other countries.  Ni said that China had so far refused to do 
<br>so and Iran was frustrated with China's continuing insistence 
<br>that the two countries shared merely "normal" relations. 
<br> 
<br>Party Seeks to Increase its Interaction with Iran 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (C) CCP Central Committee International Liaison Department 
<br>(CCID) Third Bureau (West Asia and North Africa) Director Wu 
<br>Baocai told PolOff August 31 that the CCP was seeking to 
<br>increase its relations with six major political parties and 
<br>factions in Iran.  He noted that links between the CCP and 
<br>Iranian political parties had lagged behind the growth in 
<br>relations between executive branches and far behind the 
<br>increase in economic links.  He said that deepening 
<br>understanding among the CCP leadership of the U.S. position 
<br>on Iran was another emerging priority for his office and that 
<br>he was open to continued exchanges with the U.S. on the 
<br>nuclear issue. 
<br> 
<br>CCP Perspective on Iran Nuclear Program 
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C) Wu said that CCP officials were increasingly concerned 
<br>through 2008 at the possibility of the United States taking 
<br>military action against Iran's nuclear program but assessed 
<br>that such a possibility was much lower in 2009.  He noted 
<br>that sanctions had not only failed to change Iranian behavior 
<br>and create meaningful effects in Iran but were negatively 
<br>affecting the countries joining in the international effort 
<br>to persuade Iran to stop its nuclear activities, citing as an 
<br>example constraints placed on Chinese banks from doing 
<br>business with Iran.  He said that he believed the 
<br>international community was unlikely to be able to persuade 
<br>Iran to fully abandon its enrichment activities and suggested 
<br>the U.S. offer modest economic benefits as an incentive to 
<br>persuade Iran to enter into dialogue.  Wu reiterated China's 
<br>strong opposition to Iran using its nuclear technology to 
<br>develop nuclear weapons but stressed the right of all 
<br>countries to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. 
<br> 
<br>Iran Relations Unaffected by Xinjiang Violence 
<br>--------------------------------------------- - 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (C) Wu dismissed concerns that dismay in Iran and other 
<br>parts of the Middle East over China's treatment of ethnic 
<br>Uighurs in Xinjiang province would complicate China's 
<br>diplomacy with Iran.  While acknowledging that some 
<br>high-level religious leaders in Iran had been highly critical 
<br>of China in the wake of the July violence in Xinjiang, he 
<br>said that Beijing was seeking to counter the danger of China 
<br>becoming a target for anger in the Muslim world by 
<br>significantly increasing its media outreach in the Middle 
<br>East, citing the recent establishment of an Arabic-language 
<br>version of government-run CCTV.
