<br>SUBJECT: SPANISH DEFENSE MINISTER CHACON RECEIVES U.S.
<br>AMBASSADOR
<br>
<br>REF: A. MADRID 610
<br>¶B. MADRID 568
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre, for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: New Spanish Minister of Defense Carme
<br>Chacon, who took office April 14 but has been on maternity
<br>leave since May 19, told Ambassador Aguirre during a
<br>congenial one-on-one breakfast meeting June 10 that she
<br>looked forward to working with the United States and would
<br>like to meet with her U.S. counterpart when an opportunity
<br>presents itself. The two discussed the bilateral defense
<br>relationship, with special emphasis on Spanish overseas
<br>deployments, especially Kosovo and Afghanistan. Chacon and
<br>the Ambassador also covered the June 3 congressional
<br>notification of the sale of Tomahawk missiles to Spain; the
<br>status of Spain's request for the LAIRCM aircraft protection
<br>suite; U.S. use of the Spanish bases of Moron and Rota,
<br>including ship visits and sensitivities related to Gibraltar;
<br>NATO enlargement; and opportunities for Spanish cooperation
<br>with the U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM). Minister Chacon
<br>described herself as a friend of the United States, as
<br>evidenced by her eagerness to meet with the Ambassador even
<br>before she returns to work o/a June 30. The very friendly
<br>meeting lasted 90 minutes and included the presentation by
<br>the Ambassador of a stuffed animal Bald Eagle chick for
<br>Minister Chacon's newborn son. END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Minister Chacon told the Ambassador she would like a
<br>pull-aside with Secretary of Defense Gates at the next NATO
<br>defense ministerial opportunity. While interested in seeing
<br>Secretary Gates, Chacon did not foresee traveling to the
<br>United States. Note: Spanish Secretary General for Defense
<br>Luis Cuesta had told the DCM on May 29 that MOD Chacon
<br>(because of her maternity leave) would not be going to the
<br>June NATO meeting but would attend in September, and would
<br>probably seek an appointment with SECDEF at that time (ref
<br>A).
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) On a number of issues, Minister Chacon made it clear
<br>she was pleased to discuss but not yet aware of Spanish
<br>equities. She offered no comment, for example, when the
<br>Ambassador raised NATO enlargement, urging that Spain support
<br>Membership Action Plans (MAP) for Ukraine and Georgia. She
<br>likewise asked the Ambassador about the status of LAIRCM but
<br>seemed satisfied the U.S. Embassy was doing all it could to
<br>help protect Spain's Head of State and Head of Government
<br>aircraft. While unfamiliar with U.S. procedures for
<br>notifying the intent to sell TLAM to Spain, she was pleased
<br>with the Ambassador's efforts to push for notification and
<br>interested in the outcome. On Gibraltar, MOD Chacon was
<br>pleased to learn the U.S.-Spanish Permanent Committee would
<br>hold an informational meeting June 17, and yet expressed the
<br>Spanish hope U.S. ships would call at Rota whenever possible.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Regarding Afghanistan, MOD Chacon assured the
<br>Ambassador Spain was considering the possible deployment of
<br>Spanish police trainers. She noted the original request had
<br>been for Civil Guard trainers. The Ambassador explained that
<br>either Spanish National Police or Civil Guard expertise would
<br>be welcome, and left it up to Spain to determine the most
<br>appropriate contribution. Minister Chacon assured the
<br>Ambassador that Spain also remained committed to Kosovo. She
<br>went on to suggest that the Spanish military, absent GOS
<br>recognition of Kosovo's independence, had greater credibility
<br>with Serb forces and might therefore have a calming effect in
<br>the region. The Minister told the Ambassador that Spain's
<br>parliamentary cap of 3,000 on personnel deployed overseas was
<br>real, and said she could not imagine it being raised or
<br>eliminated.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) On AFRICOM, the Ambassador noted the June 8-11 visit
<br>of General Ward was an important opportunity to exchange
<br>views on a subject of great strategic interest to both
<br>countries. Chacon was aware of the June 9-10 meetings and
<br>expressed a desire to place a Spanish liaison officer in
<br>AFRICOM. Reiterating the AFRICOM Commander's message to the
<br>CHOD, the Ambassador said AFRICOM would be pleased to have a
<br>Spanish officer, probably toward the end of 2008 once the
<br>command was better prepared to host one. Chacon noted that
<br>Spanish public opinion would be critical in determining the
<br>level of GOS engagement with the new command. While the GOS
<br>was interested in being a part of efforts in Africa, much
<br>work remained to be done and she asked that the USG
<br>coordinate closely with Spain on next steps.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) The Ambassador referenced the June 13 extradition to
<br>the United States of notorious Syrian arms dealer Monzer
<br>Al-Kassar. Though Minister Chacon seemed to disregard media
<br>speculation of an increased threat to Spanish personnel in
<br>Lebanon and elsewhere, the Ambassador urged the Minister to
<br>be aware of possible repercussions and to take necessary
<br>steps to protect Spanish forces participating in UNIFIL.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) COMMENT: Chacon's cordial invitation and subsequent
<br>approach to the Ambassador, even while she is still on
<br>maternity leave, echo the cooperative tone she adopted while
<br>serving as Minister of Housing. The Minister's assertion the
<br>deployment ceiling would not be raised, in apparent
<br>contradiction of Chief of Defense GEN Sanz's statements in
<br>the context of June 5 meetings with U.S. military visitors,
<br>may or may not reflect an entrenched GOS position and could
<br>be more an indication that Chacon is technically still on
<br>leave. Senior members of her policy staff have told Post
<br>certain initiatives await the new Minister's input or
<br>go-ahead (reftels) and the CHOD indicated he planned to lobby
<br>internally to advocate eliminating the political cap. In
<br>anticipation of the end of Chacon's maternity leave and
<br>planned June 30 return to the Ministry, on the eve of Spanish
<br>summer vacations, only time will tell how Spain plans to meet
<br>its international obligations. Adding overseas missions
<br>within current deployment ceilings will require some
<br>combination of creative accounting (including setting aside
<br>law enforcement training personnel), the use of political
<br>capital to relax congressional strictures on individual
<br>missions, and the possible incorporation of Latin American
<br>troop contributing countries under Spanish auspices from
<br>Lebanon to Afghanistan.
