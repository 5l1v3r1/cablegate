<br>
<br>Classified By: Amb. Philip S. Goldberg for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Following the September 29 death of two 
<br>civilians who ambushed a GOB eradication operation in 
<br>Carrasco National Park in Cochabamba, the Embassy's NAS 
<br>section will begin supporting GOB eradication efforts in the 
<br>park at the GOB's request. President Morales started 
<br>spinning the conflict October 2, publicly declaring that the 
<br>two civilians killed "are not cocaleros but narcotraffickers" 
<br>in an effort to maintain the loyalty of his cocalero base. 
<br>Regardless of how the GOB moves forward, this is likely a 
<br>lose-lose situation for it, given Bolivians' predisposition 
<br>toward blaming their government for civilian deaths. While 
<br>Morales attempts to walk the political highwire, our role is 
<br>to provide assistance to achieve US goals while keeping the 
<br>GOB out in front. This event demonstrates that enforcing 
<br>anti-drug laws can require tough decisions that go beyond 
<br>Morales' simplistic rhetoric about coca being harmless. End 
<br>summary. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Following the September 29 death of two civilians who 
<br>ambushed a GOB eradication operation in Carrasco National 
<br>Park in Cochabamba, the Embassy's NAS section will begin 
<br>supporting GOB eradication efforts in the park at the GOB's 
<br>request. Vice President Alvaro Garcia Linera expressed 
<br>gratitude for the Embassy's September 29 offer to assist, 
<br>stating that President Morales had decided to begin a serious 
<br>eradication campaign in the park and would need U.S. backing. 
<br>At Garcia Linera's suggestion, the DCM met September 30 with 
<br>Defense Minister Walker San Miguel to coordinate Embassy 
<br>logistical support for the GOB campaign. Based on that 
<br>meeting, NAS-owned C-130s and helicopters will begin 
<br>transporting Bolivian eradicators and troops October 2. San 
<br>Miguel told the DCM that this crisis has created an 
<br>opportunity for improved mil-mil relations. We are taking 
<br>careful measures to provide only logistical support, and to 
<br>encourage the GOB to respect human rights throughout the 
<br>planned operations. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) President Morales started spinning the conflict 
<br>October 2, publicly declaring that the two civilians killed 
<br>"are not cocaleros but narcotraffickers" in an effort to 
<br>maintain the loyalty of his cocalero base. (Note: In fact, 
<br>the civilians did not belong to the Six Federations of 
<br>Cocaleros of the Chapare, and therefore were not part of 
<br>Morales' core political support. End note). Cocaleros in 
<br>Carrasco National Park have defiantly challenged the GOB, 
<br>saying that they will defend their coca "with blood." While 
<br>Morales manages the public side of the conflict, the GOB is 
<br>investigating the deaths to confirm that GOB forces did not 
<br>commit human rights abuses. (Ironically, forensic experts 
<br>have determined that at least one of the injured was a victim 
<br>of cocaleros' friendly fire). 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Comment: Regardless of how the GOB moves forward, this 
<br>is likely a lose-lose situation for it given Bolivians' 
<br>predisposition toward blaming their government for civilian 
<br>deaths, as in October 2003. If the GOB takes a hard line and 
<br>begins eradicating Carrasco National Park in earnest, the 
<br>backlash from Morales' core political base could be strong. 
<br>Morales went to the Chapare October 2 to meet with his base, 
<br>and we will provide a read-out of that meeting septel. If the 
<br>GOB instead attempts to finesse this conflict and fails, it 
<br>will become vulnerable to further conflicts which it will 
<br>also likely lose. The final option -- negotiating a deal 
<br>which neither comes down too hard nor caves to cocalero 
<br>demands -- is a fine line that may be impossible to walk, 
<br>particularly since keeping the Constituent Assembly on track 
<br>requires the GOB's full attention. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Comment continued: While Morales attempts to walk the 
<br>political highwire, our role is to provide assistance to 
<br>achieve US goals while keeping the GOB out in front. In a 
<br>rare move, the GOB has asked for Embassy logistical 
<br>
<br>LA PAZ 00002657 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>assistance to move military units to begin the forceful 
<br>eradication of coca. We'll try to use opportunities that 
<br>present themselves to help the GOB get back onto the right 
<br>track on counternarcotics, including in signing a new LOA on 
<br>future cooperation, and will hold out hope that the goodwill 
<br>stemming from our assistance may create an opening for 
<br>increased dialogue on broader issues, including democracy and 
<br>mil-mil relations. In any case, this event demonstrates that 
<br>enforcing anti-drug laws can require tough decisions that go 
<br>beyond Morales' simplistic rhetoric about coca being 
<br>harmless. End comment.
