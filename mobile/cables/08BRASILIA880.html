<br>SUBJECT: BRAZILIAN PRESIDENTIAL ADVISOR PROMISES TO RAISE 
<br>BOLIVIA SECURITY CONCERNS 
<br>
<br>REF: A. STATE 65088 
<br>¶B. BRASILIA 834 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Clifford M. Sobel, reason 1.4 (b) and (d) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) The Ambassador met with Brazilian presidential Foreign 
<br>Policy Advisor Marco Aurelio Garcia on June 25 to express our 
<br>concern regarding the Bolivian government's lack of concrete 
<br>assurances to protect our embassy in La Paz. Garcia promised 
<br>to raise the issue with the Bolivian ambassador (which he did 
<br>immediately after meeting with the Ambassador) and with 
<br>higher levels in the Bolivian government. He also said he 
<br>would bring the request to President Lula's attention. 
<br>Garcia said that, in his view, Bolivia is at a dangerous time 
<br>and is in for a lengthy period of increased instability. He 
<br>encouraged the USG to offer the Bolivian government gestures 
<br>that clearly signal we are fully neutral between the Bolivian 
<br>government and opposition. Garcia also told the Ambassador 
<br>that President Lula's trip to Venezuela was focused on 
<br>commercial cooperation, that he did not see Raul Castro 
<br>making any additional changes in response to the EU lifting 
<br>of sanctions, and that President Bush and President Lula 
<br>should take up cooperation on biofuels at their meeting 
<br>during the G-8 in Japan. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) The Ambassador, accompanied by PolCouns (notetaker) 
<br>met with Marco Aurelio Garcia on June 25 to deliver points 
<br>ref a. Garcia was accompanied by advisors Ambassador Marcel 
<br>Biato and Elio de Almeida Cardoso. After conveying 
<br>condolences on the death of former first lady Ruth Cardoso, 
<br>the Ambassador explained to Garcia our concerns with regard 
<br>to the security of our embassy in Bolivia and requested 
<br>Brazil's assistance. (Note: The day before, Ministry of 
<br>Foreign Relations Under Secretary for South America Enio 
<br>Cordeiro had called to follow-up his conversation with the 
<br>Ambassador, ref b. Cordeiro said he had spoken with the 
<br>Colombian vice minister of foreign affairs regarding the 
<br>security of the U.S. embassy, and they had agreed that the 
<br>best approach to the Bolivian government would be through the 
<br>Papal Nuncio. End note.) 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) The Ambassador asked for Garcia's assessment of the 
<br>situation. Garcia said that the current problems stem in 
<br>part from President Morales having come to office acting "as 
<br>if it were a revolution." His polemics have been a factor in 
<br>instability, Garcia said, but the instability already 
<br>existed, noting he had visited Bolivia twelve times during 
<br>President Lula's first term, and had met with four 
<br>presidents. Bolivia's institutional problems remain, and 
<br>there has been no effort on either side to follow established 
<br>procedures. The opposition is controlled by a "hard" 
<br>element, on the one hand. On the other, the government has 
<br>refused to differentiate between opposition hard-liners and 
<br>"modern rightists" like Tuto Quiroga. So instead of 
<br>resolving issues, Garcia said, each side has hardened their 
<br>position, and they are beyond hearing each other. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) As a result, a new stalemate has developed. This will 
<br>continue, Garcia predicted, even after the August 10 
<br>referendum--if the referendum happens at all. He explained 
<br>that the questioning of the referendum's legitimacy by the 
<br>opposition provinces called into question whether it would 
<br>even take place. Garcia said it is his personal opinion that 
<br>Bolivia faces enormous dangers now. The intention of the 
<br>opposition, he believes, is to make the central government 
<br>irrelevant, to "make it bleed," so it will be brought down by 
<br>"non-institutional means." He said the government might in 
<br>fact fall, but only "within the established timeframes." 
<br>Opposition efforts to force it out of power would not work. 
<br>In any case, Garcia believes a long period of instability is 
<br>going to ensue that, like a flammable gas in the air, could 
<br>be set off by even a small spark. The fact is that Bolivia 
<br>is going through major social and political change, which is 
<br>hard to control. 
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Garcia said that many Brazilians were surprised by 
<br>Morales' confrontational posture toward Brazil early on, and 
<br>it had required a great deal of patience to put the 
<br>relationship back on track and establish a frank dialogue. 
<br>Brazil has told the Bolivian government that it needs to tone 
<br>down the rhetoric and resolve its disputes if it wants to 
<br>make progress toward what Morales wants to achieve. The 
<br>government has a reasonable macroeconomic situation, he said, 
<br>but needs to make sure that the current economic growth is 
<br>more than just a bubble. As a result, its ability to attract 
<br>investment--and particularly to maximize its energy 
<br>potential--is crucial. In the latter case, in particular, it 
<br>will run into problems not only in filling contracts with 
<br>Brazil and Argentina, but also in supplying its growing 
<br>domestic needs. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) The Ambassador said that Bolivia needs to understand 
<br>that companies, including Brazilian companies, will not 
<br>invest when they see our embassy under attack. Garcia 
<br>acknowledged the point, saying that he had pushed Petrobras 
<br>to go back into Bolivia in part as a sign to other investors. 
<br>The Ambassador asked if Garcia thought that the breakdown of 
<br>stability and security in Bolivia would hurt foreign 
<br>companies there. He responded that many companies have a 
<br>solid commitment and long-term perspective. Heavyweight 
<br>investors know that the conflict "won't go beyond a certain 
<br>point," and whichever side wins out, Bolivia will need 
<br>investment. Petrobras has not lost any money there, he 
<br>concluded. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Garcia said he would deliver the message to the 
<br>Bolivians, noting that he would be meeting with the Bolivian 
<br>ambassador following the meeting with Ambassador Sobel. 
<br>Garcia suggested that, "Maybe it is time (for the United 
<br>States) to have a frank discussion with Bolivia," adding that 
<br>"Tom (Shannon) is well-respected in Bolivia." He cannot see 
<br>how conflict with the United States is beneficial to Bolivia, 
<br>he said. The Ambassador suggested that it might serve as a 
<br>distraction for the Bolivian government's domestic problems. 
<br>Garcia took the point, but said that in the long run, they 
<br>would gain in some ways but lose in others. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) "We bet on dialogue," Garcia stressed, suggesting that 
<br>a "mutual non-aggression pact" was in order. The Ambassador 
<br>responded that public support for the security of our embassy 
<br>would undoubtedly open other channels for dialogue, but 
<br>stressed that security of our embassy cannot be open for 
<br>discussion. Garcia agreed. But he cautioned that we should 
<br>"not underestimate anti-Americanism in some circles." 
<br>("There's an old joke we used to tell," he said: "Why hasn't 
<br>there ever been a coup in the United States? Because they 
<br>don't have an American embassy.") He said that the United 
<br>States needs to offer a sign that we are not on anyone's 
<br>side, something that would increase American credibility 
<br>vis-a-vis the Bolivian government. Without wishing to be a 
<br>mediator, he said, Brazil is willing to help in whatever it 
<br>can, recalling a similar commitment he made to A/S Shannon 
<br>two years earlier. He suggested that Brazil had a hand in 
<br>encouraging Venezuelan President Chavez to lower his tone and 
<br>become "less present" today on the issue. Chavez understood 
<br>that his efforts were too invasive and ultimately 
<br>counterproductive. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Coming back to the request, Garcia said the Bolivian 
<br>ambassador in Brasilia was "very professional" and he would 
<br>sound him out. He also committed to raising the request with 
<br>President Lula, adding he knew that A/S Shannon had raised 
<br>the issue with Brazilian Ambassador Patriota in Washington. 
<br>(Note: In a readout on June 26, Amb. Biato said that Garcia 
<br>had had a long meeting with the Bolivian ambassador and had 
<br>made clear that it was important for the Bolivian government 
<br>to cease provoking the United States and to make amends. 
<br>Garcia had stressed that conflict could not be helpful to the 
<br>Bolivians. Biato reiterated that Garcia intended to raise 
<br>the issue with President Lula and with "higher levels" in 
<br>
<br>BRASILIA 00000880 003 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>Bolivia. End note.) 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) The Ambassador asked about President Lula's 
<br>priorities for his June 27 meeting with President Chavez. 
<br>Garcia said that Chavez is seeking an import substitution 
<br>model for Venezuelan agriculture and development, and the two 
<br>presidents will discuss ten projects that are still being 
<br>developed in the areas of steel production, integrated 
<br>circuits, television, and plastics, among others. In 
<br>agriculture, the Venezuelans are looking to work with Brazil 
<br>to develop either family farms or large-scale (i.e., 80,000 
<br>ha.) soy farms. They are also interested in dairy and 
<br>poultry. The ultimate goal for Chavez, he said, is food 
<br>security, and the Venezuelans are trying to create the 
<br>infrastructure for the entire food production chain, using 
<br>both public and private investment. As an aside, Garcia said 
<br>that Venezuela's new finance minister, Ali Rodriguez, "is 
<br>different" in that he is knowledgeable and can talk directly 
<br>to Chavez. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) The Ambassador asked what Garcia thought would come 
<br>of the EU decision to lift its sanctions. Garcia said he did 
<br>not see Raul Castro giving any type of concession to foreign 
<br>pressure, and that the EU move was a sign that there is a 
<br>perception Cuba is changing. He noted that in Brazil, both 
<br>businesses and the press that had been critical of Brazil's 
<br>Cuba policy have changed their tune. Businesses are now 
<br>interested in investing, and there is less criticism in the 
<br>press. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) The Ambassador raised biofuels, stressing that 
<br>although many would like to divide Brazil and the United 
<br>States on the issue, we would like to continue working 
<br>together. He recalled that Civil Household Minister Dilma 
<br>Rousseff had pressed for President Bush to attend the 
<br>renewables conference that Brazil plans to host in November, 
<br>and asked what the objective would be. Garcia said that 
<br>Presidents Bush and Lula should take the issue up again at 
<br>the G-8 in Japan. (Comment: It has become clear over the 
<br>course of conversations with foreign ministry and presidency 
<br>officials that Brazil is still in the initial stages of 
<br>planning the conference; they have asked for USG input on the 
<br>agenda and objectives. End comment.) After Garcia departed 
<br>to meet with the Bolivian ambassador, the Ambassador stressed 
<br>to Biato that Brazil's effort to distinguish between corn and 
<br>cane ethanol was not productive, and that our focus should be 
<br>on the future of biofuels. Biato stressed that President 
<br>Lula was not intending to go to Rome for the FAO conference, 
<br>but had done so in the end when the focus of criticism fell 
<br>on ethanol. The draft speech he had taken with him to Rome 
<br>had been "toughened up" there. Biato said he could not 
<br>predict how Lula would react to the idea of lowering the tone 
<br>on this issue. (Comment: Other contacts, however, have told 
<br>us they do expect Lula to back away from this line. End 
<br>comment.)
