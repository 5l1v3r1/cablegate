<br>VISIT TO SAUDI ARABIA 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: AMBASSADOR JAMES SMITH 
<br>REASONS 1.4 (B) & (D) 
<br> 
<br>INTRODUCTION 
<br>------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) Madam Secretary, Mission Saudi Arabia warmly welcomes 
<br>your visit to the Kingdom, a country which, by virtue of its 
<br>energy resources, financial power, counterterrorism efforts, 
<br>and leadership of the Muslim world, plays a critical role in 
<br>many global and regional issues of importance to us.  Your 
<br>visit comes at a time of emerging opportunities for 
<br>engagement to advance the goals that you and the President 
<br>have laid out in your speeches in the region. 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (C) Our alliance with Saudi Arabia, while complicated and 
<br>subject to occasional disjunctions, has proven durable. 
<br>Taking stock of where we stand, we see a mixed picture. The 
<br>good news is that the Saudi leadership still sees the United 
<br>States as its most important strategic partner and guarantor 
<br>of its stability.  We also share many global and regional 
<br>objectives, including the need for global financial and 
<br>energy stability, a common view of threats posed by terrorism 
<br>and extremism, the dangers posed by Iran and destabilization 
<br>in Pakistan, and the linkage that progress toward Middle East 
<br>peace has to virtually all other regional issues.  Finally, 
<br>Saudi Arabia has become one of our most important allies in 
<br>the fight against Al-Qaida and terror financing. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C) The bad news is that we differ on tactics in some key 
<br>objectives, and we are often frustrated by Saudi 
<br>unresponsiveness and a dearth of interlocutors among an aging 
<br>collective leadership. The status of women, religious 
<br>freedom, and human rights are ongoing concerns.  On the Saudi 
<br>side, King Abdullah believes we are not always reliable, 
<br>consistent, or willing to heed his advice on important issues 
<br>such as Iraq. Saud Al-Faisal and others have openly been 
<br>critical of U.S. policies they describe as having shifted the 
<br>regional balance of power in favor of arch-rival Iran. 
<br>Differences of opinion on some of these issues can be 
<br>exacerbated by our differing cultures and value systems, 
<br>which can introduce a degree of skepticism and hesitancy in 
<br>the relationship. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) Despite the problems, a negative assessment of the 
<br>bilateral relationship would miss a critical point relevant 
<br>to U.S. goals in the region:  Saudi Arabia is a country in 
<br>transition, and the changes underway present opportunities 
<br>for engagement that can advance U.S. interests and national 
<br>security. Saudi Arabia faces transitions on multiple levels, 
<br>from the geopolitical, where its trade and energy relations 
<br>are shifting from west to east, to economic, where greater 
<br>integration in the world economy is steadily exposing Saudis 
<br>to international best practices.  Domestically, greater 
<br>access to internet and cell phones is unleashing new forms of 
<br>social activism, something demonstrated by an outpouring of 
<br>Saudi spontaneous voluntary assistance in the aftermath of 
<br>the Jeddah floods. 
<br> 
<br>EDUCATION & DIVERSIFICATION TO COMBAT EXTREMISM 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -- 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) Having faced down what amounted to an insurgency by 
<br>Al-Qaida from 2003 to 2006, Saudi Arabia's leadership 
<br>acknowledged the pressing need for systemic reforms to combat 
<br>extremist ideology and provide for a rapidly expanding 
<br>population (the annual growth rate is about 2 percent).  King 
<br>Abdullah's strategy is two-pronged:  he has attacked the 
<br>roots of the extremism that fed Al-Qaida through education 
<br>and judicial reforms to weaken the influence of the most 
<br>reactionary elements of Saudi Arabia's religious 
<br>establishment.  He is also promoting economic 
<br>diversification.  The King is keenly aware of the urgent need 
<br>to make Saudi education more relevant to today's workplace 
<br>and increase the role of women in the economy, goals which 
<br>remain controversial in this deeply conservative, 
<br>inward-looking desert Kingdom.  Guided by a vision that 
<br>dovetails with some key elements of the President's Cairo 
<br>speech, King Abdullah has begun to implement an ambitious 
<br>plan to transform Saudi Arabia's economy away from excessive 
<br> 
<br>RIYADH 00000178  002 OF 005 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>reliance on hydrocarbons and towards a knowledge-based 
<br>economy that can provide sustainable development for the 
<br>long-term.  Achieving these goals will require nothing short 
<br>of a revolution in the education system and significant 
<br>changes in most aspects of Saudi society, especially the 
<br>status of women. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (U) Seen from the outside, the pace of political reform 
<br>seems glacial (a notable exception is that changes introduced 
<br>after the WTO negotiations have been very fast for any 
<br>country; regulatory agencies are also standing up quickly). 
<br>Yet for certain elements of Saudi society, the changes are 
<br>coming too fast.  Whatever the pace, however, the reality is 
<br>that serious reforms are gradually but irrevocably changing 
<br>Saudi society.  Recently implemented reform measures include 
<br>re-shuffling the Ministry of Education's leadership last 
<br>February (bringing in the King's pro-reform son-in-law as the 
<br>new minister); a top-to-bottom restructuring of the country's 
<br>courts to introduce, among other things, review of judicial 
<br>decisions and more professional training for Shari'a judges; 
<br>the creation of a new investment promotion agency to overhaul 
<br>the once-convoluted process of starting a business here; the 
<br>creation of a regulatory body for capital markets; the 
<br>construction of the King Abdullah University for Science and 
<br>Technology (the country's new flagship and 
<br>controversially-coed institution for advanced scientific 
<br>research); and a substantial budgetary investment in 
<br>educating the workforce for future jobs. The Saudi government 
<br>is also encouraging the development of non-hydrocarbon 
<br>sectors in which the Kingdom has a comparative advantage, 
<br>including mining, solar energy, and religious tourism.  The 
<br>Kingdom's 2010 budget reflects these priorities -- about 25 
<br>percent is devoted to education alone -- and amounts to a 
<br>significant economic stimulus package. 
<br> 
<br>U.S. PARTNERSHIPS TO SUPPORT 
<br>REFORM & ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (SBU) Saudi officials have been candid in stressing the 
<br>importance they place on strong ties with the United States 
<br>to help them meet reform challenges, both through increased 
<br>engagement at the government level, including educational 
<br>exchanges and more FDI, particularly in energy, high tech, 
<br>and manufacturing.  The past year has seen several large 
<br>investments by prominent U.S. firms in advanced technology 
<br>areas, and we are working to raise the profile of our trade 
<br>and investment relations, including through a major Saudi 
<br>exposition in Chicago at the end of April.  The Mission has 
<br>also steadily expanded USG engagement in education, public 
<br>health, science & technology, entrepreneurship, and civil 
<br>society.  There are now more than 22,000 Saudi students 
<br>studying in the US, exceeding pre-9/11 levels.  Public health 
<br>engagement has included breast cancer awareness and CDC 
<br>cooperation to set up an advanced epidemic screening network 
<br>that protected this year,s 3 million Hajj pilgrims.  Our 
<br>Science & Technology umbrella agreement is already expanding 
<br>cooperation, including new projects with NASA. Our MEPI 
<br>programs include a first-time ever exchange visit by a group 
<br>of Saudi judges, leadership development for women, prevention 
<br>of violence against women and children, and youth exchange 
<br>and study. One female participant in our Social 
<br>Entrepreneurship Forum was a finalist in the 2009 Global 
<br>Student Entrepreneur Awards. She and seven other Saudi 
<br>entrepreneurs will attend the President's April summit. 
<br>Mission elements have also provided training to help the SAG 
<br>implement a new law to combat trafficking in persons. 
<br>Intensive engagement with the SAG on IPR is another success 
<br>story.  You will want to congratulate Saudi officials for the 
<br>significant progress Saudi Arabia has made over the last 
<br>several years in improving IPR protection, which resulted in 
<br>the Special 301 Committee deciding to remove Saudi Arabia 
<br>from the Watch List. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>SAUDI STRATEGIC CALCULATIONS 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (C) TURNING EAST:  Saudi Arabia is trying to come to terms 
<br>with the shift in global energy and trade ties towards Asia, 
<br> 
<br>RIYADH 00000178  003 OF 005 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>which has both political and economic consequences. 
<br>Bilateral trade with China has more than tripled, and China 
<br>will soon be Saudi Arabia,s largest importer.  Saudi Arabia 
<br>has also committed significant investments in China, 
<br>including the $8 billion Fujian refinery.  Increased trade 
<br>has also brought increased friction, including anti-dumping 
<br>complaints from both sides.  Saudi Arabia is thinking through 
<br>how best to take a leaf from the Chinese playbook and use 
<br>these expanded trade ties to achieve important political 
<br>goals.  In this regard, Saudi Arabia has told the Chinese 
<br>that it is willing to effectively trade a guaranteed oil 
<br>supply in return for Chinese pressure on Iran not to develop 
<br>nuclear weapons. 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (S/NF) COUNTERING IRAN: We expect that Saudi Arabia will 
<br>continue to develop its ties with China, in part to 
<br>counterbalance relations with the West.  While the King's 
<br>preference is to cooperate with the U.S., he has concluded 
<br>that he needs to proceed with his own strategy to counter 
<br>Iranian influence in the region, which includes rebuilding 
<br>Riyadh-Cairo-Damascus coordination, supporting Palestinian 
<br>reconciliation, supporting the Yemeni government, and 
<br>expanding relations with non-traditional partners such as 
<br>Russia, China, and India to create diplomatic and economic 
<br>pressure on Iran that do not directly depend on U.S. help. 
<br>The King told General Jones that if Iran succeeded in 
<br>developing nuclear weapons, everyone in the region would do 
<br>the same, including Saudi Arabia. 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (S/NF) The King is convinced that current U.S. engagement 
<br>efforts with Tehran will not succeed; he is likely to feel 
<br>grimly vindicated in his view by Ahmadinejad's February 11 
<br>boast that having successfully enriched uranium to a level of 
<br>20 percent, Iran "is now a nuclear nation."  The King told 
<br>General Jones that Iranian internal turmoil presented an 
<br>opportunity to weaken the regime -- which he encouraged -- 
<br>but he also urged that this be done covertly and stressed 
<br>that public statements in support of the reformers were 
<br>counterproductive.  The King assesses that sanctions could 
<br>help weaken the government, but only if they are strong and 
<br>sustained.  The King will want you to elaborate on the 
<br>President's statement that the time for sanctions has come. 
<br>He will also want to hear our plans for bolstering Gulf 
<br>defenses vis a vis Iran.  (The King has invited General 
<br>Petraeus to his desert camp for discussion on this topic on 
<br>Tuesday.) 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (C) CLIMATE CHANGE:  Your visit offers an important 
<br>opportunity to head off a serious clash over climate change. 
<br>Saudi officials are very concerned that a climate change 
<br>treaty would significantly reduce their income just as they 
<br>face significant costs to diversify their economy.  We want 
<br>to get beyond the obstructionism that Saudi negotiators have 
<br>often shown during the negotiations and persuade senior 
<br>leaders to work with us in a partnership to meet their 
<br>strategic concerns, including by cooperating on developing 
<br>solar and biomass energy.  The King is particularly sensitive 
<br>to avoid Saudi Arabia being singled out as the bad actor, 
<br>particularly on environmental issues.  Your conveying the 
<br>importance the President places on working as partners with 
<br>Saudi Arabia on the Copenhagen process will be very important 
<br>in making this dialogue more constructive.  Secretary Chu 
<br>intends to explore specific areas of collaboration during his 
<br>February 21-23 visit. 
<br> 
<br>SAUDI REGIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (S) PREVENTING A COLLAPSE OF YEMEN:  Saudi participation 
<br>in international diplomatic efforts to stabilize Yemen 
<br>reflect Saudi fears that instability on its southern border 
<br>is a clear and present danger.  The King will tell you that 
<br>Yemen's strategic location makes an Al-Qaida presence there 
<br>more threatening than in Afghanistan; he will stress the need 
<br>to support Yemeni unity, despite his mistrust of Ali Abdullah 
<br>Saleh.  With respect to Saudi involvement in the war against 
<br>the Houthis, the King will stress that the SAG's motivation 
<br>was self-defense.  As Al-Qaida infiltrators from Yemen 
<br>multiplied, the SAG concluded that the Houthi rebellion had 
<br>distracted Saleh's government to the detriment of Saudi 
<br> 
<br>RIYADH 00000178  004 OF 005 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>security.  The military intervention was triggered by a 
<br>Houthi incursion into Saudi territory, but it presented a 
<br>long-sought excuse to fortify the porous Saudi-Yemeni border. 
<br>On February 7, Prince Khalid also informed Ambassador Smith 
<br>the fighting is wrapping up, and that a ceasefire arrangement 
<br>could be in place by mid-February. 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (C) GESTURES AFTER ALL?:  The King appreciates the 
<br>President's commitment to Middle East peace but is skeptical 
<br>the U.S. can bring sufficient and sustained pressure to bear 
<br>on Israel, especially regarding settlements.  The King told 
<br>General Jones that progress on Middle East peace was only 
<br>possible if President Obama was willing to pressure Israel, 
<br>and Saudi officials have rebuffed U.S. requests for 
<br>confidence-building gestures to help restart negotiations. 
<br>Despite their adamant rhetoric, however, several members of a 
<br>private Jeddah-based think tank run by a retired Saudi 
<br>general have very quietly been participating in Track Two 
<br>discussions, apparently with SAG knowledge, and even put 
<br>forward a proposal on Gaza.  In a more dramatic public 
<br>encounter that has provoked commotion in the region, former 
<br>Saudi Ambassador to the U.S. Prince Turki Al-Faisal shook 
<br>hands with Israeli Deputy FM Ayalon to settle a dispute over 
<br>joint seating at a Munich conference. Both sides have since 
<br>insisted the gesture did not signal changes in policy, with a 
<br>"senior Saudi diplomat" issuing a statement emphatically 
<br>denying that the incident constituted any form of recognition 
<br>for Israel. 
<br> 
<br>¶14. (S/NF) AFGHANISTAN/PAKISTAN:  King Abdullah firmly 
<br>believes that Asif Zardari is the primary obstacle to the 
<br>government's ability to move unequivocally to end terrorist 
<br>safe havens there ("when the head is rotten, it affects the 
<br>whole body").  The King told General Jones that U.S. 
<br>development assistance would rebuild trust with the Army, 
<br>which he asserted was staying out of politics in deference to 
<br>U.S. wishes, rather than doing what it "should."  On 
<br>Afghanistan, the King has expressed support for the new U.S. 
<br>strategy, saying that spending on roads, schools, hospitals 
<br>and mosques would dissipate popular mistrust and help rebuild 
<br>the country.  The King has not yet acknowledged the Saudi 
<br>role in Taliban mediation in conversations with USG 
<br>officials; GIP Director Prince Muqrin has explained to 
<br>several recent USG visitors that the SAG prefers to keep such 
<br>discussions in intelligence channels until any agreement is 
<br>reached.  Perhaps reflecting this, the Saudi media downplayed 
<br>President Karzai's recent visit and the Afghan Ambassador 
<br>reported that the meeting with the King lasted only ten 
<br>minutes. 
<br> 
<br>A NOTE ABOUT THE KING 
<br>--------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶15. (C) The Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques will offer you 
<br>a traditional Saudi welcome at the desert "encampment" 
<br>outside Riyadh, where he likes to spend his winter vacations. 
<br> You will find in 86-year old King Abdullah a wry and 
<br>forthright interlocutor.  Having struggled with a speech 
<br>impediment throughout his life, he tends to express himself 
<br>tersely.  Reflecting his Bedouin roots, he judges his 
<br>counterparts on the basis of character, honesty, and trust. 
<br>He expects commitments to be respected and sees actions, not 
<br>words, as the true test of commitment; and he expects 
<br>good-faith consultations, not surprises.  Once the King has 
<br>lost trust in a counterpart, as has been the case with Nouri 
<br>Al-Maliki or Asif Zardari, his personal antipathy can become 
<br>a serious obstacle to bilateral relations.  On the other 
<br>hand, as with President Obama, the King's esteem will help 
<br>navigate differences and at times change policies.  The King 
<br>is undoubtedly looking forward to his discussions with you, 
<br>and Mission Saudi Arabia enthusiastically looks forward to 
<br>supporting your visit. 
<br>
