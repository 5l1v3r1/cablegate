<br>SUBJECT: BRAZIL: POLICE PUBLICLY ADMIT AL QAEDA'S PRESENCE;
<br>GOB DENIES TERRORISM A THREAT
<br>
<br>Classified By: Charge d' Affaires, a.i. Lisa Kubiske, reason: 1.4 (b) a
<br>nd (d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (U) Summary: The head of the Brazilian Federal Police,s
<br>(DPF) intelligence division admitted publicly during a
<br>Brazilian Chamber of Deputies, hearing on terrorism July 7
<br>that an individual arrested in April on hate crimes-related
<br>charges was in fact linked to al Qaeda (AQ), the first time a
<br>Brazilian government official has gone on record admitting
<br>this link. The admission followed earlier denials by non-DPF
<br>Brazilian government officials responding to press reports
<br>that the individual was linked to the terrorist group.
<br>During the hearing, Minister Jorge Felix, head of the Office
<br>of the Presidency,s Institutional Security Cabinet (a
<br>combination DNI, ONDCP, with some NSC-like attributes), stuck
<br>to the usual script, despite the admission, and denied there
<br>was any evidence that terrorists had or would be interested
<br>in establishing a presence in Brazil, even as he asserted
<br>that Brazil remained vigilant to the threat. As part of this
<br>vigilance, Felix reported during the hearing that GSI had
<br>created a new counter-terrorism (CT)-focused entity within
<br>its structure as well as an interagency working group to
<br>draft a new national security law, which could end up
<br>addressing Brazil,s single biggest inadequacy when it comes
<br>to its CT efforts: lack of CT legislation. While Felix, the
<br>DPF, and members of Congress agreed on the need for CT
<br>legislation, there is a lack of will in the GOB to expend the
<br>political capital to do push it, as a result of ideological
<br>and historical concerns that such legislation might be used
<br>against legitimate opposition and social movements. Concerned
<br>to maintain Brazil,s position as a racially, ethnically, and
<br>religiously harmonious society, the GOB is hesitant to engage
<br>in what it thinks might be perceived as provocative foreign
<br>and domestic policy. Nonetheless, post believes that the good
<br>operational cooperation on CT between our law enforcement
<br>agencies enjoy and Brazil,s general commitment to
<br>international counterterrorism norms provide a basis to
<br>engage the GOB and spur gradual change in Brazil,s mindset.
<br>In light of Brazil,s growing global clout, this could pay
<br>dividends well beyond Brazil. End summary.

<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) During a 7 July hearing of the Chamber of Deputies
<br>Organized Crime and Public Security Committee, Daniel Lorenz
<br>de Azevedo, head of the DPF,s intelligence division publicly
<br>admitted for the first time that the DPF believed the
<br>individual arrested on April 26 for hate crimes in Sao Paulo,
<br>Khaled Hussein Ali was, in fact, believed by the DPF to be
<br>closely linked to al Qaeda. As global head of the Jihad
<br>Media Battalion, Lorenz noted during the hearing that Ali had
<br>performed duties for the terrorist group, from propaganda to
<br>logistics, recruitment, and other activities. (Note: In late
<br>May, the press started reporting on the 26 April arrest of
<br>the then unidentified Ali,s links to AQ, which were followed
<br>by quick statements by the prosecutor denying that the
<br>individual had any ties to terrorism. That same week, during
<br>a meeting with CODEL Thompson, General Felix categorically
<br>denied the terrorism and AQ connection, even as he noted that
<br>it was a DPF matter. End note.)
<br>
<br>¶3. (U) Lorenz further stated that Ali was not the first or
<br>only AQ-linked individual to have lived in or transited
<br>through Brazil. He mentioned Khalid Sheikh Mohammed,s trip
<br>to Foz de Iguacu in 1995 (subject of a cover story in Veja
<br>magazine several years ago). He further noted that the DPF
<br>has monitored several other "extremists" that have transited
<br>through Brazil or had taken up residence in the country.
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br>General Felix: We will never admit anything
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br>
<br>¶4. (U) During the hearing, Felix testified that it was the
<br>government,s belief that terrorists could potentially use
<br>Brazilian territory for transit, to exploit its resources, or
<br>for safehaven. He further added that, even as Brazil has
<br>maintained an aggressive posture to prevent such activity
<br>
<br>BRASILIA 00001206 002 OF 005
<br>
<br>
<br>from taking place, "we haven,t seen any confirmation that
<br>such activity has ever taken place, even if the media claims
<br>otherwise."
<br>
<br>¶5. (U) Faced with questions from Members of Congress who were
<br>keying off of Lorenz testimony, Felix added that Brazil,s
<br>public stance regarding the presence of terrorism is part of
<br>a deliberate strategy on the part of GSI and an assessment of
<br>what is in Brazil,s best long-term interest. Felix noted
<br>that over the years he has had the opportunity to meet with
<br>officials from various countries at all levels, including
<br>those who affirm that there may be terrorists in Foz de
<br>Iguacu and Sao Paulo, and to date none of these countries
<br>that make these statements, going back to the AMIA bombing,
<br>have ever provided Brazil with evidence that this is the
<br>case. He further added, with emphasis, that "even if a
<br>problem were to appear, we won,t admit that the problem
<br>exists." According to Felix, this "denialism" is a posture
<br>that he believes will "protect" Brazil. He observed that
<br>modifying this language could provoke actions by unwelcome
<br>elements and could set back a policy that, while it
<br>repudiates terrorism, seeks to avoid inviting or importing
<br>threats.
<br>
<br>- - - - - - - - - -
<br>Yet, Threats Abound
<br>- - - - - - - - - -
<br>
<br>¶6. (U) Felix characterized the theoretical risks Brazil faces
<br>as pretty low. He added that, "because of our external
<br>policy, our domestic characteristics, our international
<br>projection, our image of a positive peaceful country with
<br>various ethnicities and religions interacting peacefully in
<br>harmony" there is little risk of attacks against Brazil. At
<br>the same time, Felix recognized that the risks are not the
<br>same when discussing foreign structures within Brazil. The
<br>situation in those cases is different, particularly when it
<br>comes to ideological or religious terrorism, which does not
<br>respect frontiers. He cited Argentina,s experience, which
<br>suffered two attacks in the 1990,s against its Jewish
<br>community. It shows, according to Felix, that even in a
<br>country that faces reduced risks against its own interests,
<br>it can suffer attacks against foreign interests in that
<br>country. Felix also added that, because of Brazil,s vast
<br>territory and porous borders, it can be difficult to monitor
<br>the movement or activities of terrorists within Brazilian
<br>territory.
<br>
<br>¶7. (U) Lorenz disagreed with Felix,s characterization of the
<br>level of risk Brazil faces. He noted that the DPF has
<br>followed terrorism since 1995, a year after the AMIA bombing.
<br>In that time, DPF has seen several phases in the evolution
<br>of the terrorist threat in Brazil. First, DPF began with the
<br>notion that terrorists could be transiting or hiding in
<br>Brazil, but that there was no threat of attacks in Brazil.
<br>Lorenz used KSM,s travel through Foz de Iguacu in December
<br>of 1995 to illustrate this phase. Then the DPF started
<br>noticing that some of those who were transiting or hiding
<br>were beginning to establish residency in Brazil by marrying
<br>Brazilian women and adopting Brazilian children. In a third
<br>stage, DPF began seeing that some Brazilians began to be
<br>captivated by extremist ideology and the idea of martyrdom.
<br>Some Brazilians have left Brazil for what the DPF believes is
<br>extremist religious instruction in Iran and other places in
<br>the Middle East. Finally, the DPF has begun to see some of
<br>those foreigners that achieved permanent residency start
<br>preparations for acts outside the country and helping
<br>terrorist groups with recruitment, training, logistics
<br>support, and reconnaissance for terrorist actions not in
<br>Brazil. This last stage, added Lorenz, was what the DPF saw
<br>in Ali,s case. He added that the DPF,s perception is that
<br>things are evolving and that in this continuing evolution of
<br>activity, which still remains outwardly focused, could
<br>perhaps evolve in a different direction eventually.

<br>
<br>
<br>¶8. (U) While offering differing views in some areas, both
<br>Lorenz and Felix agreed that the Triborder Area (TBA) is not
<br>a problem anymore. According to Lorenz, the question of
<br>financing for groups for Islamic groups out of the TBA is a
<br>non-issue, adding that "we have found that Zakat is a normal
<br>thing." He criticized attacks on Brazil from foreign
<br>countries, including the United States, that accuse Brazil of
<br>ignoring this fundraising, especially after the DPF has found
<br>that most of the money that goes from the TBA passes through
<br>the United States on its way to Lebanon. "We have told the
<br>Americans, I can guarantee that this money that goes to
<br>Lebanon passes through the United States, I can prove it"if
<br>you think this money is for terrorism, why won,t you stop it
<br>yourselves," adding, we can give you the names and bank
<br>accounts.," Lorenz continued, "people who know TBA in the
<br>1990s, like I did, know that it is not now what it once was.
<br>It is now the Chinese criminal networks who are the most
<br>active there, not the Arabs."

<br>Lack of Legislation a Problem
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br>
<br>¶9. (U) Federal Deputy Raul Jungmann (PPS, Socialist People's
<br>Party, opposition; of Pernambuco) questioned Felix on
<br>Brazil,s failure to pass terrorism legislation. He told the
<br>story of talking to an advisor to Minister of Justice Tarso
<br>Genro who told Jungmann that passing anti-terrorism
<br>legislation could actually invite terrorism into Brazil. He
<br>finally asked Felix if Brazil could condemn terrorism in its
<br>constitution and various other laws, sign all 13
<br>international conventions against terrorism, have
<br>anti-terrorism divisions in the DPF and ABIN, why couldn,t
<br>it have it legislation dealing with terrorism? Without
<br>directly answering Jungmann, both Felix and Lorenz
<br>acknowledged that the lack of terrorism legislation is a
<br>limitation for Brazil. The DPF acts, noted Lorenz, via
<br>connected crimes. Lorenz stated that the DPF looks to see if
<br>terrorists are committing crimes related to terrorism, such
<br>as preparatory acts. For example, he noted, a terrorist
<br>could enter the country to commit a terrorist act and the DPF
<br>would look at whether he used fraudulent documents or had
<br>immigration violations; if he were to use a car bomb, they
<br>would see if he stole a car. In some cases, he added, the
<br>DPF has already used this approach to neutralize people with
<br>Islamic extremist leanings.
<br>
<br>¶10. (U) In the case of Ali, he used the LAN house (or
<br>cybercafe) he ran to lead and coordinate the activities of
<br>Jihad Media Battalion. At the beginning, noted Lorenz, he
<br>used it for to perform propaganda on behalf of AQ,s cause.
<br>Later it turned ito a space for recruitment, support,
<br>training, communications, operational security, and battle
<br>orers for actions outside Brazil. The DPF started te
<br>investigation after the FBI passed them an IP ddress used by
<br>a person in Brazil. But, Lorenz dded, we arrested him not
<br>because of these activities, and not because of the battle
<br>orders to case places for actions outside Brazil, but through
<br>technical surveillance to decipher and break encryption his
<br>messages, which allowed us to find instances of hate crime,
<br>such as anti-Semitism and preaching hate against West. Ali
<br>was not just engaging in hate crimes, Lorenz hastened to add,
<br>but that was enough to charge him for a crime, even if it was
<br>a lesser crime with low penalties.

<br>Building new structures
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - -
<br>
<br>¶11. (U) Responding to Congressional questions of what
<br>measures Brazil has taken to prevent terrorist activities in
<br>Brazil, Felix responded that in addition to signing all 13 UN
<br>and OAS conventions on the topic, which require actions by
<br>GOB, Brazil has cooperative relations with police and
<br>intelligence units with many countries. In addition, he
<br>added, Brazil has been active in monitoring entry points and
<br>has progressively improved capabilities in this area. Brazil
<br>has also focused on of military, federal police, and state
<br>police forces focused on combating terrorism. Brazil,
<br>
<br>BRASILIA 00001206 004 OF 005
<br>
<br>
<br>according to Felix, has closely studied the Spanish model,
<br>particularly in the area of responding to attacks. Felix
<br>noted that the Spanish response to the Madrid train bombings
<br>was very effective, as the trains were running shortly after
<br>the attacks.
<br>
<br>¶12. (U) Brazil is also, according to Felix, currently
<br>elaborating a bill for the "defense of sovereignty", which
<br>will update the old national security law. The GSI-chaired
<br>Council on Foreign Relations and National Defense is working
<br>with MoJ on this proposal. (Note: the Council on Foreign
<br>Relations and National Defense, or CREDN, is a National
<br>Security Council-like body not to be confused with the
<br>Foreign Relations and National Defense Committees in Congress
<br>which also use CREDN for their initials. End Note.).
<br>According to Felix, the CREDN working group is going to try
<br>to come up with a list of crimes that constitute terrorism,
<br>and noted that "eventual punishments are less important; more
<br>tricky is which crimes should be included." He added that
<br>there were still some weeks to go before the working group
<br>finishes up its work, but that they would soon submit the
<br>proposal to the ministries and after that to the President
<br>for approval before being introduced before Congress.
<br>
<br>¶13. (U) Felix also discussed the newly created Nucleus of the
<br>Center for the Coordination of Activities for the Prevention
<br>and Combat of Terrorism, to be housed within GSI. According
<br>to Felix, this nucleus emerged from discussions the GOB had
<br>in 2004-05 as part of a project to create a national
<br>counterterrorism authority, which would have created a
<br>national agency to prevent and combat terrorism. In the end,
<br>noted Felix, they concluded that the attributes of an
<br>anti-terrorism "agency" would render it unworkable within the
<br>Brazilian system, so GSI decided on creating a "center."
<br>However, because of bureaucratic difficulties in creating
<br>such a center, GSI went ahead and proposed the creation of
<br>this nucleus.
<br>
<br>¶14. (U) The problem for GSI in creating a "center" is that it
<br>does not have its own personnel. GSI officials are all
<br>seconded from other agencies. According to Felix, GSI will
<br>be sending proposal to Congress to allow GSI to have its own
<br>personnel. It will be staffed on a part-time basis by the
<br>officers that are detailed to GSI. The nucleus will follow
<br>actions related to terrorism; promote threat assessment
<br>studies; and provide coordination among the various
<br>ministries. (Comment: The "center" Felix referred to does
<br>not exist. GSI needs statutory authority to be able to
<br>create a center that will have its own staff. The newly
<br>created "nucleus" is in essence a proto-center, similar to
<br>the U.S. Terrorist Threat Integration Center, that could,
<br>after gaining statutory authority, eventually morph into a
<br>"center", or something somewhat equivalent to the U.S.,s
<br>National Counterterrorism Center. End comment.)
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br>Comment: Long-Term Engagement Needed
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) Lorenz,s admission represented a rare instance in
<br>which a Brazilian public official admits that AQ-linked
<br>individuals are either in, or have transited through, Brazil.
<br>That it was admitted publicly by one of Brazil,s top
<br>authorities on the subject of terrorism should give the
<br>United States some cover when engaging in
<br>counterterrorism-related dialogues with Brazil, including at
<br>the 3 Plus 1. It will also be helpful as we engage Brazilian
<br>audiences on the issue of passing CT legislation. In a
<br>surprising public admission, Felix, Lorenz, and members of
<br>Congress present at the hearing all agreed on the need to
<br>pass anti-terrorism legislation, with Lorenz stating point
<br>blank that the reason the Jihad Media Battalion,s Ali could
<br>not be charged with a more serious crime was inadequacy of
<br>current laws.
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) Unfortunately, the admission appears unlikely to
<br>change Brazil,s public posture. While there appears to be
<br>an agreement in the GOB on the need to pass CT legislation,
<br>there is a lack of will to expend the political capital to do
<br>so. General Felix stuck to the script even as he was being
<br>
<br>BRASILIA 00001206 005 OF 005
<br>
<br>
<br>contradicted, a script we have also heard from interlocutors
<br>at Brazil,s foreign ministry. Revealingly, Felix admitted
<br>that no matter what evidence is presented Brazil,s posture
<br>is deliberate and will not change. The argument boils down
<br>to this: Brazil is a racially, ethnically, and religiously
<br>harmonious society that engages in a correct and
<br>un-provocative foreign policy. As a result, Brazil is not a
<br>target of terrorists. In order to maintain this position,
<br>Brazil must do nothing that will make it a target, such as
<br>taking a higher-profile or more confrontational approach to
<br>counterterrorism efforts or actively looking to pass
<br>anti-terrorism legislation.
<br>
<br>¶17. (C) To further complicate matters, many senior officials
<br>in both the government and the opposition were labeled
<br>terrorists and suffered exile, prison, or in some cases
<br>torture, under the military regime that ended in 1985. This
<br>is the case, for example, of the two most prominent
<br>presidential candidates to replace Lula in 2011, Lula,s
<br>minister of the Civil Household Dilma Rousseff and Sao
<br>Paulo,s opposition governor Jose Serra. In addition, many
<br>in the current government fear that members of what they
<br>consider to be legitimate social movements fighting for a
<br>more just society might be branded terrorists. Finally,
<br>Brazilians express concern that anti-terrorism legislation
<br>would be viewed as directed at Arab-Brazilians or Foz do
<br>Iguacu, and thus would become a divisive issues. As a
<br>result, many Brazilian officials are uncomfortable with
<br>giving the state greater authority to fight terrorism.
<br>
<br>¶18. (C) This mindset presents serious challenges to our
<br>efforts to enhance counterterrorism cooperation or promote
<br>passage of anti-terrorism legislation. At the same time, with
<br>good operational cooperation on the issue between our law
<br>enforcement agencies, Brazil,s stated commitment to
<br>international anti-terrorism regimes, and work underway to
<br>draft a new national security law, there is every reason to
<br>enhance our engagement with the Brazilian government on this
<br>issue. Although there is little chance of an immediate
<br>change in posture or that a new national security law will be
<br>seriously considered in Congress before the 2010 presidential
<br>elections, we should begin engaging the GOB now on this
<br>issue. Securing passage of anti-terrorism legislation,
<br>changing the mindset of senior officials with regard to the
<br>threat that terrorism poses, and finding acceptable ways to
<br>cooperate on terrorism will be a long-term effort requiring
<br>commitment and creativity on our part. In light of Brazil,s
<br>role as a regional leader and its growing role as a global
<br>power, the investment will likely pay dividends well beyond
<br>Brazil.
