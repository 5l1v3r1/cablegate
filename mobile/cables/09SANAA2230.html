<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) SUMMARY. As the sixth war against the Houthis
<br>continues to squeeze Yemen's conventional military, the ROYG
<br>has looked to its U.S. and U.K.-funded and trained
<br>counterterrorism forces to provide some relief to battered
<br>army forces. The Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU) - trained to
<br>detect small terrorist cells and investigate and prevent
<br>terror attacks on civilian targets - is a poor tactical
<br>choice for use against a long-term domestic insurgency. The
<br>ROYG, desperate to defeat the Houthis at any cost, has
<br>largely ignored USG concerns regarding deployment of the CTU
<br>to Sa'ada. The CTU has been unable to go after genuine
<br>terrorist targets like al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula
<br>(AQAP) while it has been tied down in Sa'ada. CTU
<br>involvement in a ROYG operation against AQAP on the morning
<br>of December 17 is a welcome return to its core mission,
<br>although it remains to be seen if this was any more than a
<br>one-off occurrence. END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>Signs of royg desperation in sa'ada
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) As the sixth war in Sa'ada, now in its fifth month,
<br>drags on in a tit-for-tat struggle between ROYG military
<br>forces and Houthi rebels, the ROYG has attempted to use its
<br>elite CT forces to provide needed extra muscle.xxxxx,
<br>told PolOff in late November that he felt his forces were
<br>being pulled into the Sa'ada conflict because of the
<br>perception that the CTU is made up of "super-men that can
<br>solve any problem and defeat anybody." (Note: CTU forces
<br>were initially sent to Sa'ada in July to investigate the
<br>kidnapping of a group of Western aid workers. Post assesses
<br>that the CTU was drawn into the Houthi conflict in early
<br>September. End Note.) Such a misperception of the CTU's
<br>capabilities and mission was hurting the unit, xxxxx added.
<br>During the U.S.-Yemen Joint Staff Talks hosted in Sana'a
<br>November 8-11, xxxxx publicly impressed upon Brigadier
<br>General Ali Dahan of the Yemen Special Operations Forces
<br>(YSOF), another elite military unit also involved in CT
<br>operations, and other senior Ministry of Defense (MOD)
<br>leadership the severity of the situation in Sa'ada and the
<br>toll it was taking on the CTU. He told Dahan, "You may not
<br>be feeling the hurt of this war, but the CTU is fighting in
<br>Sa'ada and is taking casualties." (COMMENT: xxxxx was angry
<br>with Dahan for stating that the YSOF was "ready and available
<br>for more training exercises with U.S. forces" while the CTU
<br>was being deployed in Sa'ada. He believes the YSOF should be
<br>doing more in Sa'ada, which would allow the CTU to return to
<br>its primary mission. END COMMENT.)
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) Increasingly desperate to defeat the Houthis, the
<br>ROYG continues to insist that fighting the Houthis is a
<br>legitimate component of CT operations, thus justifying the
<br>use of CTU forces in Sa'ada. The National Security Bureau's
<br>Colonel Akram al-Qassmi told PolOffs on December 9, "The war
<br>against the Houthis is not a distraction from the CT fight.
<br>It is the CT fight." xxxxx Despite the injection
<br>of CTU forces into the fight three months ago, the Sa'ada war
<br>drags on and, according to CTU leadership, the CTU is taking
<br>"heavy casualties" due to their lack of training for this
<br>type of warfare. At the urging of CTU leadership, the
<br>Supreme Security Council agreed to move all CTU forces (two
<br>platoons) out of Sa'ada on December 9. xxxxx confirmed that
<br>the MOI Regional Commander ordered elements of the CTU,
<br>believed to be one platoon, to remain in Sa'ada until Sa'ada
<br>City is cleared of Houthi fighters.
<br>
<br>Ct operations constrained due to sa'ada war
<br>-------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) Following the return of one platoon to Sana'a, the
<br>CTU undertook its first CT operation against AQAP in four
<br>months on the morning of December 17. However, according to
<br>xxxxx deployment to Sa'ada has hurt the CTU's readiness
<br>capabilities. Ideally, the unit is primed for rapid response
<br>to any CT threat in and around Sana'a within 10 minutes. The
<br>
<br>Sanaa 00002230 002 of 002
<br>
<br>
<br>CTU is broken into four platoons which rotate every two
<br>weeks: one on leave, a second in training, a third on
<br>standby, and a fourth as a Quick Reaction Force (QRF). With
<br>one platoon in Sa'ada, and another on active duty in Sana'a,
<br>the CTU has no surge capacity. xxxxx said that the CTU's
<br>training and operational cycle has been disrupted by the
<br>Sa'ada war. "Since August, the QRF has been in Sa'ada,
<br>taking heavy casualties because they have been engaged in
<br>heavy fighting. We have only had a chance to send a relief
<br>team twice since the latest conflict started." He said that
<br>the use of USG-provided armored vehicles and humvees has
<br>"been fundamental in preventing casualties." (NOTE: Post has
<br>repeatedly questioned ROYG use of U.S. military equipment and
<br>U.S.-trained forces intended to combat AQAP in the war
<br>against the Houthi rebels. END NOTE.)
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) The CTU was established just six years ago at the
<br>urging of the USG and has received substantial funding and
<br>training from U.S. special operations forces and British
<br>conventional army trainers. Their training has focused on
<br>detecting and neutralizing the AQAP threat, not fighting a
<br>long-term, domestic insurgency. In particular, the CTU is
<br>predominantly trained for CT "direct action missions" in
<br>which they isolate an AQAP cell and capture its members based
<br>on specific intelligence. Referring to the guerilla warfare
<br>tactics the Houthis have been using against traditional ROYG
<br>military forces, xxxxx U.S. training in
<br>"unconventional warfare" and tactics used by the U.S. forces
<br>in "asymmetric warfare" of the type encountered in the
<br>mountains of Afghanistan, suggesting the CTU expects to
<br>continue to use its forces in Sa'ada.
<br>
<br>
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) Bogged down in a seemingly unwinnable war that
<br>pits conventional forces against determined rebels, the ROYG
<br>has resorted to using its specialized CT units. Untrained to
<br>fight this type of conflict, the overstretched CTU has
<br>reportedly sustained significant casualties, missed training
<br>opportunities and been derailed from its principal mission:
<br>to combat AQAP. While U.S. concerns over diversion of troops
<br>and equipment have been acknowledged, they have clearly not
<br>resulted in a significant change of ROYG focus from the
<br>Houthis to AQAP. CTU deployment to Sa'ada, while a
<br>distraction, is not a crushing blow to all potential CT
<br>activities, as demonstrated by the December 17 CT operation.
<br>However, it remains to be seen if this indicates a balancing
<br>of priorities between the Houthi conflict and AQAP, or if it
<br>is simply a momentary return to the CTU's primary mission.
<br>End comment.
