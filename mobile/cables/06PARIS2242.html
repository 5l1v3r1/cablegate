<br>
<br>¶1. (U) SUMMARY: Attorney General Alberto Gonzales traveled to 
<br>France from March 1 to 4, 2006. He met with Pierre de 
<br>Bousquet de Florian, Director of the DST; Nicolas Sarkozy, 
<br>Minister of the Interior; French Counter-terrorism 
<br>Officials; Ron Noble, Secretary General of Interpol; Pascal 
<br>Clement, Minister of Justice and a number of media and 
<br>opinion maker representatives. The meetings were cordial 
<br>and constructive and focused on counter-terrorism 
<br>cooperation; with the Attorney General expressing 
<br>appreciation to his counterparts for the excellent working 
<br>relationship between France and the United States in this 
<br>area; and his making a number of appearances with the media 
<br>and opinion makers to explain to the French public the 
<br>United States approach to combating terrorism. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) After a March 1 evening arrival, on March 2, the 
<br>Attorney General met with Pierre de Bousquet de Florian, 
<br>director of the DST, France's internal security service. 
<br>Both the Attorney General and de Bousquet complimented US- 
<br>French C/T cooperation, calling it "exceptional," and 
<br>recognizing that both countries were fighting a common 
<br>enemy, and both had experienced losses. France's C/T fight 
<br>was led by intelligence agencies working in concert with 
<br>the judiciary, said Bousquet. Although France did not 
<br>pretend that its model could be applied elsewhere, it 
<br>strongly believed that judiciary and police/intelligence 
<br>services needed to cooperate closely in order to attack 
<br>terrorist networks before they struck. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) In response to questions from the Attorney 
<br>General concerning the DST's view of the evolving nature of 
<br>the terrorist threat, de Bousquet expressed a concern that 
<br>democracies not compromise their essential values in 
<br>combating terrorism as this could weaken the foundation of 
<br>their societies. Most important, said Bousquet, was to win 
<br>the battle of communication. Videos of USG actions were a 
<br>continuing source of motivation and repulsion for 
<br>extremists. Although USG communication regarding terrorism 
<br>was focused on convincing its citizens, images of abuses in 
<br>Iraq and the messages of the USG as received overseas both 
<br>rebounded negatively overseas and encouraged Muslim youth 
<br>to join extremist movements, said Bousquet. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) Bousquet said France was most concerned about 
<br>the worldwide upsurge of radical Islam. For this reason, 
<br>the GOF was building a "French Islam" a moderate Islam 
<br>that worked within the French culture. All those who 
<br>refuse to participate in this system would have no place in 
<br>French society, said Bousquet. He believed that the next 
<br>generation of terrorists would be born and well-integrated 
<br>into French society, since well-educated and integrated 
<br>French Muslims were already beginning to be seen in 
<br>jihadist circles. He called for continued close 
<br>coordination between intelligence and police agencies, and 
<br>asked that the Attorney General look into streamlining 
<br>current procedure for passing telephone and Internet 
<br>communication details based in the United States and needed 
<br>for investigations in France. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) The Attorney General also met Minister of the 
<br>Interior Sarkozy. Also present for the Ministry of the 
<br>Interior were Diplomatic Advisor David Martinon, Legal 
<br>Advisor Sylvie Smanniotto, and DST Director de Bousquet de 
<br>Florian. Sarkozy complained that the Ministry of the 
<br>Interior felt cooperation in terrorism matters with the 
<br>United States were one sided. He declined to give further 
<br>specifics Attorney General Gonzales stated that if Sarkozy 
<br>had a specific complaint, he should feel free to call him 
<br>directly. [Note: Subsequent discussion with de Bousquet 
<br>and Sarkozy's staff yielded apologies and assurances that 
<br>GOF-USG CT cooperation is, and is seen as, good.] 
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) Sarkozy also signaled that he was under pressure 
<br>to remedy the current inability of France to produce 
<br>biometric visas in conformity with recent U.S. legislation, 
<br>so as to participate in the visa waiver program. [Note: 
<br>Septel on recent biometric passport developments.] 
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) Sarkozy also discussed general geopolitical 
<br>issues concerning France and the United States. He 
<br>believed France should not be in an adversarial posture 
<br>with the U.S. and should change its approach. The U.S. is 
<br>an important friend and ally of France, the level of 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00002242 002 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>convergence of interest is much greater than with major 
<br>non-democratic powers like Russia or China. While he was 
<br>constrained by the current government's policies, he 
<br>believed the situation would change after the election. He 
<br>indicated he would travel to the U.S. to be able to tell 
<br>the French public what his impressions were of the U.S. and 
<br>that he would provide more detail on his positions as his 
<br>run for the French presidency advanced. Sarkozy stated 
<br>that France and the international community would have to 
<br>help the United States resolve the situation in Iraq, as 
<br>the U.S. could not do so alone; perhaps with international 
<br>forces eventually replacing the U.S. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU) On the morning of March 3, Ambassador Stapleton 
<br>hosted a breakfast for the Attorney General and four key 
<br>French counter-terrorism officials, counter-terrorism 
<br>investigative judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere, Prosecutor 
<br>General of Paris Yves Bot, Prosecutor of Paris Jean-Claude 
<br>Marin, and Director of the Criminal Division of the Justice 
<br>Ministry Jean-Marie Huet. The Attorney General started the 
<br>discussion by thanking the officials for their assistance 
<br>and asked them for their assessment of the current counter- 
<br>terrorism situation. Led by the commentaries of Judge 
<br>Bruguiere, the officials noted the advantages they operated 
<br>under, including their ability to protect the sources of 
<br>intelligence information that they use in their 
<br>investigations, the fact that they do not need to detail 
<br>facts to the same extent as in the U.S. to arrest persons, 
<br>or undertake searches and seizures or wiretaps, and the 
<br>fact that there was no jury system, no formal rules on 
<br>admissibility of evidence and no hearsay rule. There 
<br>followed a general legal discussion on these aspects of the 
<br>French system. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (SBU) Judge Bruguiere also outlined the two general 
<br>threat trends France was experiencing: First, that French 
<br>youth were being drawn into terrorist activities to a 
<br>greater extent, reflecting that the threat was moving from 
<br>East to West. Second, that the new terrorists were on an 
<br>increasing level of sophistication and education. Recent 
<br>arrests had demonstrated that highly educated electronics 
<br>experts had been recruited by jihadist networks for 
<br>purposes of executing attacks in Europe, and that they had 
<br>developed highly sophisticated methods for detonating 
<br>explosive charges at long distance. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (SBU) The Attorney General next met with Ron Noble, 
<br>Secretary General of Interpol, on March 3. The discussion 
<br>
<br>SIPDIS 
<br>commenced with the Attorney General inquiring about the 
<br>recent request for Interpol red notices made by Italy 
<br>concerning the alleged abduction of an individual from 
<br>Italy by USG officials. Noble advised that the procedure 
<br>at this stage is for Interpol to review the requests to 
<br>determine whether issuance of the red notices would be 
<br>consistent with the Interpol Constitution, which prohibits 
<br>Interpol from participating in political matters, or 
<br>pursuing politically motivated requests. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (SBU) Noble also briefed the AG on a number of current 
<br>issues, including a push to list with Interpol those al- 
<br>Qaida and Taliban members on the UN sanctions list so that 
<br>Interpol could generate a new kind of notice providing 
<br>details on these persons to police in member states, and to 
<br>facilitate wider contribution to and use of the Interpol 
<br>database on lost or stolen passports. Regarding 
<br>lost/stolen passports, a pilot project conducted between 
<br>Interpol and the Swiss government demonstrated that the 
<br>Interpol database could be used in real-time, leading to a 
<br>marked increase in the seizures and prosecutions for those 
<br>using false travel documents. He cited the example of one 
<br>seized passport that had been in use since April 2003, had 
<br>passed through 19 countries and had successfully gone 
<br>through border controls 46 times without being caught. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (SBU) Noble requested that the Attorney General 
<br>consider detailing a legal attach/prosecutor to Interpol 
<br>headquarters, given the rise in legal issues in recent 
<br>years. The Attorney General expressed concern that a DOJ 
<br>prosecutor might have to address cases that would 
<br>conceivably work against USG interests. Noble replied that 
<br>the DOJ prosecutor would always have the option of recusing 
<br>him/herself. 
<br>
<br>¶13. (U) Embassy Paris also organized three press events 
<br>for Attorney General Gonzales on March 3: a print press 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00002242 003 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>roundtable, an interview with Radio France Internationale, 
<br>and an interview with French all-news channel LCI-TV. 
<br>Major French newspapers as well as wire services Agence 
<br>France Presse, Reuters, and Associated Press, attended his 
<br>print press roundtable. The AG took numerous questions on 
<br>Guantanamo and detainee treatment. He explained the 
<br>differences between treatment of detainees on a battlefield 
<br>and prisoners in the criminal justice system and 
<br>underscored that the U.S. treats detainees humanely and in 
<br>accord with Geneva even if they do not come under the 
<br>Geneva Convention since they are unlawful combatants. Wire 
<br>reports quoted AG Gonzales as saying: "The relationship 
<br>between French and U.S. law enforcement is outstanding," 
<br>and, "Both countries share the common objective of 
<br>preventing terrorist attacks." The press roundtable also 
<br>triggered articles in center-left daily Libration 
<br>(circulation: 158,086) and Catholic daily La Croix 
<br>(circulation: 102,022). La Croix highlighted that, "Four 
<br>years after 9/11, the determination of the U.S. government 
<br>has not faltered when it comes to fighting against terror." 
<br>
<br>¶14. (U) Excerpts of his interview with the French 
<br>worldwide broadcasting radio network Radio France 
<br>Internationale (RFI-- similar to Voice of America) aired on 
<br>March 3, and the interview was aired in full in RFI's 
<br>weekly Wednesday, RFI English service program "Voices." In 
<br>the radio interview, AG Gonzales was asked about the CIA 
<br>flights controversy, and he emphasized that the U.S. is a 
<br>nation of laws that respects its legal commitments. 
<br>
<br>¶15. (U) The all-news television network LCI featured the 
<br>full interview in its "News of the World" program, which 
<br>was re-broadcast three times the same evening. The 
<br>Attorney General was asked about his visit to Paris, the 
<br>use of death penalty in Texas when President Bush was 
<br>governor -- AG referred to the due process of law accorded 
<br>the prisoners, and the possible death penalty for Zacharias 
<br>Moussaoui who, the AG said, has pleaded guilty and his 
<br>sentence will be decided by the Court. 
<br>
<br>¶16. (SBU) The Attorney General met with French Justice 
<br>Minister Pascal Clement on March 3. The two complimented 
<br>U.S.-French cooperation as "very good" on terrorism and 
<br>other legal matters. The Attorney General said Interior 
<br>Minister Sarkozy had complained that counter-terrorism 
<br>information sharing was not as robust as it could be, to 
<br>which Clement responded that in his opinion, information 
<br>sharing between U.S. and France was good. They compared 
<br>notes on the different French and U.S. legal systems. The 
<br>Attorney General reassured Clement that any information 
<br>provided by France for the Moussaoui trial would not be 
<br>used to support a death penalty conviction. He also 
<br>invited Clement to the United States. Clement thanked the 
<br>Attorney General and said he would be pleased to do so when 
<br>their schedules permitted. 
<br>
<br>¶17. (SBU) Clement hailed the U.S. and France's mutual 
<br>exchange of magistrates as a way to ward off any budding 
<br>legal problems between the two countries. He said the lack 
<br>of major problems to discuss was a fruit of this type of 
<br>exchange. Clement asked the AG when the U.S. would ratify 
<br>the Council of Europe Cybercrime Convention, noting that 
<br>France had recently done so. The AG stated that he hoped 
<br>we would be able to overcome final Senate objections soon 
<br>and get the treaty ratified. They also discussed a number 
<br>of other issues, including the sex offenses, and 
<br>psychiatric testimony, child abduction cases, and growing 
<br>illegal drug use. At the conclusion of the meeting, the 
<br>ministers had a walk-out for the press, in which they 
<br>delivered statements regarding the issues discussed. The 
<br>Clement statement included mention of the assurance 
<br>provided by the U.S. that the evidence provided by France 
<br>in the Moussaoui case would not be used to obtain the death 
<br>penalty. 
<br>
<br>¶18. (U) This visit provided a good opportunity for Attorney 
<br>General Gonzales to both meet in depth key French law 
<br>enforcement officials, express U.S. appreciation for the 
<br>strong cooperative law enforcement relationship between the 
<br>two countries, as well as to explain the French public 
<br>through his interviews the United States approach to 
<br>combating terrorism. Ambassador Stapleton accompanied the 
<br>Attorney General to all of his meetings. The Attorney 
<br>General departed on March 4, 2006, for other meetings in 
<br>the United Kingdom.
