<br>OTHERWISE STRONG FRANCO-COLOMBIAN RELATIONS
<br>
<br>
<br>Classified By: POL/MC Josiah Rosenblatt for Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) On March 6, Colombian Ambassador to France Fernando
<br>Cepeda Ulloa described Franco-Colombian relations as "poor"
<br>in a breakfast meeting with Ambassador Stapleton and WHA PDAS
<br>Craig Kelly. Cepeda encapsulated the current distrust
<br>between the two governments by suggesting that the GOF
<br>considers Colombia a banana republic that takes policy
<br>direction from the United States. He complained that the GOF
<br>coordinates public messaging with Franco-Colombian hostage
<br>Ingrid Betancourt's family in a way that undermines President
<br>Uribe.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Cepeda recalled that under Chirac he felt only
<br>limited pressure concerning Betancourt. Chirac simply urged
<br>Cepeda to tell President Uribe that "a military solution is
<br>not the best option." There was little movement on the issue
<br>until Sarkozy took office in May 2007. Since then,
<br>Franco-Colombian relations have essentially been compressed
<br>to this single issue, according to Cepeda, who is reportedly
<br>close to President Uribe. He attributed President Sarkozy's
<br>single-minded focus on securing Betancourt's freedom to a
<br>personal enmity towards former Prime Minister Dominique de
<br>Villepin and the desire to prove Sarkozy could accomplish
<br>what Villepin could not. He described the Betancourt family
<br>efforts to publicize Ingrid's detention as a textbook media
<br>success and a textbook disaster to achieving her freedom.
<br>Despite his claim of "poor" overall relations, Cepeda did
<br>note that Franco-Colombian relations were positive with
<br>fruitful cultural exchanges, and welcome trade and investment
<br>flows. There is also good bilateral counter-narcotics
<br>cooperation.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) COMMENT: Sarkozy's personal involvement in the FARC
<br>hostage case may have contributed to securing the release of
<br>some lower-profile hostages while perversely raising Ingrid
<br>Betancourt,s value to the FARC as a hostage. A desire to
<br>best his rival de Villepin, who failed after expending
<br>tremendous effort to win Betancourt's freedom, may have
<br>triggered Sarkozy's intervention. However, Betancourt,s
<br>long-standing public profile in France predates Sarkozy's
<br>presidency and release would have naturally appealed to
<br>Sarkozy as a challenge and as a demonstration of his ability
<br>to apply his will and bring results. Despite positive
<br>fundamentals in the Franco-Colombian relationship, this
<br>hostage situation negatively colors what should be a good
<br>news story between France and Colombia.
<br>
<br>¶4. (U) This message has been cleared by PDAS Kelly.
