<br>SUBJECT: CODEL LOWEY WITH UAE FOREIGN MINISTER ON IRAN 
<br> 
<br>CLASSIFIED BY: Richard Olson, Ambassador; REASON: 1.4(B), (D) 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (S/NF) Summary.  In a February 17 meeting, UAE Foreign Minister 
<br>Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan (AbZ) discussed Iran with a 
<br>four-member Congressional delegation led by Chairwoman Nita Lowey 
<br>of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations. 
<br>AbZ told the Codel the nuclear issue is only one aspect of the Iran 
<br>problem, and that Iran's regional meddling was a serious concern. 
<br>He pledged the UAE's backing as the US rallies support for new 
<br>sanctions but questioned whether they would achieve the desired 
<br>effect.  AbZ noted the UAE's growing concern that Gulf allies were 
<br>being shut out of Iran sanctions planning.  End Summary. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>IRAN'S REACTORS AND REACH 
<br> 
<br>------------------------- 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S/NF) AbZ began by expressing pride in the US-UAE 123 agreement 
<br>and the bilateral relationship generally.  According to AbZ, the 
<br>123 is a powerful example for the region and provides a transparent 
<br>alternative to Iran's nuclear model.  The UAE views Iran as a huge 
<br>problem that goes far beyond nuclear capabilities.  Iranian support 
<br>for terrorism is broader than just Hamas and Hizballah.  Iran has 
<br>influence in Afghanistan, Yemen, Kuwait, Bahrain, the Eastern 
<br>Province of KSA, and Africa (AbZ mentioned Nigeria specifically). 
<br>Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Venezuelan President Hugo 
<br>Chavez have close, cooperative ties.  If Iran acquires nuclear 
<br>weapons, the expeditionary aspect of its foreign policy will become 
<br>ever more challenging for neighboring states. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>POSSIBILITY AND FUTILITY OF SANCTIONS 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S/NF) Lowey asked what AbZ thought about tougher sanctions 
<br>against Iran and how the UAE can help with China.  AbZ said the US 
<br>and its allies "have to decide how to stop Iran" and that the UAE 
<br>was surprised at the Chinese attitude.  AbZ noted the Emiratis and 
<br>the Saudis have spoken to the Chinese, and the UAE expressed a 
<br>willingness to expand its energy ties (Note: AbZ seemed to be 
<br>indicating that this was intended as a carrot, but he acknowledged 
<br>the difficulty of supplanting an Iran-China trade relationship that 
<br>reached $50 billion last year.  End Note.) 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (S/NF) AbZ urged quick action on tough new sanctions.  The UAE 
<br>is conscientious in its efforts to enforce existing UNSC sanctions 
<br>but the Iranians have been able to find other routes, bypassing UAE 
<br>ports, to import what they need.  AbZ predicted that smart and 
<br>swift implementation of new sanctions could still be ineffective 
<br>but said that we must try. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>GULF NEIGHBORS FEELING LEFT OUT 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (S/NF) AbZ highlighted a growing belief the UAE and the GCC are 
<br>being left out of our Iran sanctions consultations.  AbZ told 
<br>Chairwoman Lowey that the P5+1 negotiations with Iran should be 
<br>expanded to included the GCC.  AbZ said there is a "trust barrier" 
<br>to full GCC support for US policy, as there is a deep suspicion 
<br>that the US is proceeding without consulting Gulf allies. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (S/NF) AbZ raised (as he likes to do regularly) the 2005 EU 
<br>package offer to Iran that was briefed to the UAE by the Iranians, 
<br>not the US or another ally.  Things have improved since then, but 
<br>"we still need some serious trust building between the US, the EU, 
<br>and the GCC" on this issue.  The DCM reminded AbZ (and the Codel) 
<br>that there are extensive and privileged communications between the 
<br>UAE and the USG on policy towards Iran and on sanctions planning. 
<br>AbZ acknowledged there was trust from the UAE, but the rest of the 
<br>GCC had continuing concerns.  "Your problem today is to fix your 
<br>relations with the GCC, quickly.  A few countries in the region are 
<br>already dealing with Iran as if they had the bomb." 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (S/NF) AbZ said GCC states are left wondering what will happen 
<br>to them in any deal the US and Iran reach through back channel 
<br>conversations.  He compared the current multilateral conversations 
<br>over Iran's nuclear program with negotiations over North Korea's 
<br>nuclear program, asking why North Korea's neighbors are part of the 
<br>Six Party negotiations, but the GCC is not equally involved in 
<br>similar conversations about and with Iran. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>"WHAT IF?" SCENARIOS 
<br> 
<br>-------------------- 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (S/NF) In response to questions from members of Congress, AbZ 
<br>said that if Iran goes nuclear others in the region will move 
<br>forward on the same track and the nuclear nonproliferation treaty 
<br>will completely break down.  He said a crisis or confrontation in 
<br>the region would create oil supply problems worldwide.  14 million 
<br>barrels a day pass through the Strait of Hormuz.  That said, he 
<br>noted that the US and UAE militaries have plans to keep Hormuz 
<br>clear. 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (S) AbZ concluded the meeting with a soliloquy on the importance 
<br>of a successful peace process between Israel and its neighbors as 
<br>perhaps the most effective way of reducing Iran's regional 
<br>influence. 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (SBU) Members of Congress in attendance: Congresswoman Nita 
<br>Lowey, Congressman Tom Cole, Congresswoman Barbara Lee, 
<br>Congresswoman Donna Edwards.
