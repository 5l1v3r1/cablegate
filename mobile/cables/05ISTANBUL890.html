<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) Summary: After briefly basking in the reflected
<br>glow of last week's exciting UEFA Champion's League Final in
<br>Istanbul between Milan and Liverpool, corporate sponsor
<br>Mastercard has found itself dealing with a public relations
<br>nightmare in recent days following public criticism of
<br>inclusion in its match city guide of critical commentary
<br>about both Turkey and its revered founder, Mustafa Kemal
<br>Ataturk. The offending passages, first publicized in the
<br>liberal Islamist daily "Zaman," addressed the issue of
<br>Turkish-Kurdish relations and the Armenian tragedy of 1915.
<br>Mastercard briefly closed its office following death threats
<br>against its General Manager, and has since officially
<br>apologized, noting that the offending material had not been
<br>reviewed by any company officials, but instead emanated from
<br>the "Lonely Planet," which produced the bulk of the
<br>publication. The public reaction, which has also included
<br>calls for a boycott of the company by Turkish NGO's and the
<br>threat of public prosecution from the Istanbul Governor,
<br>highlights once again how close to the surface core
<br>nationalist reflexes and taboos are in the post-December 17th
<br>environment. End Summary.
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) Shortlived Honeymoon: Mastercard officials, whose
<br>biggest problem last week was the deluge of calls they were
<br>receiving seeking tickets to the May 25th Milan-Liverpool
<br>match, faced a more serious crisis on May 30 when "Zaman"
<br>newspaper published extracts from the city guide the company
<br>distributed to its VIP guests and journalists. In the
<br>"Lonely Planet" produced publication, which was written by an
<br>Istanbul-based British journalist, brief reference was made
<br>to the issue of minorities in Turkey, with sections covering
<br>both the Kurds and the Armenians. The breezy narrative noted
<br>that "Ataturk banned any expression of Kurdishness in an
<br>attempt at assimilation," adding that major battles and
<br>atrocities followed in the 1920s and 1930s, with the deaths
<br>of more than 30,000 coming since 1984. On the equally
<br>sensitive Armenian issue, the guide noted that while most
<br>Armenians had remained loyal to the Ottoman Empire, some had
<br>rebelled, engaging in terrorism that set off a powerful
<br>anti-Armenian backlash and the "widespread massacre of
<br>innocent Armenians in Istanbul and elsewhere."
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) Harsh Reaction: The publication sparked harsh
<br>reaction from most quarters, with Istanbul Governor Guler
<br>denouncing the "insult" to Turkey and warning that "such a
<br>sponsorship firm needs to be more cautious." He added that
<br>officials would investigate the publication and determine if
<br>it constituted a criminal offense. NGO's were also quick to
<br>leap on the bandwagon, with the Consumers' Union calling for
<br>a boycott of the company if it did not officially apologize.
<br>Turkish sports officials also expressed disappointment with
<br>the publication. More worryingly, anonymous callers phoned
<br>in death threats, and nationalist groups indicated that they
<br>would organize protests, resulting in closure of Mastercard's
<br>office early this week and the provision of extra security
<br>for General Manager Ozlem Imece.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Damage Control: Since the story broke on May 30,
<br>Mastercard has been engaged in damage control. In an initial
<br>announcement on May 30, the company admitted its mistake and
<br>noted it had contacted the "Lonely Planet" to demand the
<br>removal of "erroneous information" from the guide. When this
<br>did not quell the furor, the company went further a day later
<br>and officially apologized. In a public statement, General
<br>Manager Imece observed that she had not known of some of the
<br>material that was to be included in the publication, and was
<br>"deeply shocked" by it. Privately she has told us that the
<br>company was blind-sided by the furor, having been focused on
<br>security for their VIP guests last week. This, she said, was
<br>something that "no one expected."
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Comment: Given the sensitivities that exist here,
<br>inclusion of any material on topics such as Turkey's minority
<br>policy or the Armenian tragedy in a sporting guide was in
<br>retrospect a serious mistake. The harsh, instinctive
<br>reaction, however, shows the heightened sensitivities and
<br>hair-trigger nature of public discourse here since the
<br>December 17th EU decision. Post RSO has reached out to
<br>Mastercard, which is an active member of the OSAC Advisory
<br>Council, to ensure that they are satisfied with the police
<br>response they have received and to provide assistance if
<br>needed. End Comment.
