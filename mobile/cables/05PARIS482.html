<br>ONS 1.4 B/D 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) Summary: During a January 24 lunch hosted by the 
<br>Ambassador, top terrorism investigating judge Jean-Louis 
<br>Bruguiere discussed a number of ongoing investigations he was 
<br>leading and also commented on a variety of terrorism-related 
<br>issues. He believed that 2005 would be a dangerous year, 
<br>given the expertise demonstrated during terrorist attacks in 
<br>2004, and thought in particular that Europe and Asia would be 
<br>targeted. End summary. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) Bruguiere heads the Paris-based section of 
<br>investigating judges that focus on terrorism issues. He and 
<br>fellow investigating judge Jean-Francois Ricard concentrate 
<br>on international and Islamic terrorism, while the other 
<br>investigating judges examine Basque, Corsican and 
<br>Breton-related terrorism. Bruguiere is by far the most 
<br>visible and media-savvy of the terrorism investigating 
<br>judges. Just in the past month, he has been the subject of 
<br>extensive profiles in Le Monde, a French center-left daily 
<br>newspaper, and the Financial Times. 
<br>
<br>--------------------- 
<br>INTERNATIONAL THREATS 
<br>--------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) Bruguiere said he believed both Europe and Asia were 
<br>front-line targets for terrorism in 2005. One essential 
<br>problem with the European Union response, said Bruguiere, was 
<br>that different countries had different institutional 
<br>approaches to dealing with terrorist threats, despite the 
<br>fact that many EU states had open borders via the Schengen 
<br>agreement. He cited Germany and the Netherlands as two 
<br>countries whose legal and administrative institutions made 
<br>them difficult partners, despite their political will. 
<br>Bruguiere speculated that those countries with direct 
<br>experience of terrorism, such as the U.S., Spain, France and 
<br>the U.K., had more fully developed their counter-terrorism 
<br>capabilities. Potential terrorists knew which countries 
<br>offered comparatively greater protections, and they took 
<br>advantage of these opportunities within the EU, said 
<br>Bruguiere. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) Al-Qaida-linked terrorists demonstrated their ability 
<br>to strike within Europe not only during the Madrid bombings, 
<br>but also during the 2004 Istanbul bombings, said Bruguiere. 
<br>He noted that British financial and diplomatic institutions 
<br>were targeted in Istanbul at the exact time that President 
<br>Bush was in the U.K. Bruguiere also mentioned his ongoing 
<br>concern with the Caucasus and Chechnya. He believes that 
<br>al-Qaida terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi has an extensive 
<br>network in the region. The Caucasus, said Bruguiere, are 
<br>only "a three-hour flight to Paris." In order to combat this 
<br>mosaic of threats, Bruguiere said European countries needed 
<br>to undertake two key actions: further sensitize their 
<br>populations and strengthen the crackdown on informal 
<br>financial networks, especially neighborhood storefronts and 
<br>Pakistani-origin hawalas. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) Bruguiere also cited Asia as a particular area of 
<br>concern. He and Ricard had discovered a Japan-based network 
<br>after arresting and interrogating French citizen and longtime 
<br>Japanese resident Lionel Dumont. Bruguiere said he believed 
<br>terrorism in Asia would target financial centers. He was 
<br>particularly concerned by the Pakistani-based terrorist 
<br>organization Lashkar-i-Tayyiba. 
<br>
<br>----------------------- 
<br>DOMESTIC INVESTIGATIONS 
<br>----------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S) Bruguiere and Ricard's investigation into French 
<br>nationals going to fight in Iraq (reftel) led to several 
<br>arrests in the morning of January 24, Bruguiere said 
<br>(additional reporting septel). He said their investigation 
<br>had found juveniles as young as 13 trying to reach Iraq. 
<br>Their investigation had not revealed formal recruitment 
<br>networks, said Bruguiere, but rather a number of autonomous 
<br>attempts to go on jihad to Iraq. The most common route for 
<br>those trying to reach Iraq was through Syria and its many 
<br>madrasas and other prayer centers. He noted that the 
<br>conflict in Iraq has emerged as a powerful recruitment tool 
<br>for terrorism. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) Responding to a question regarding false documents, 
<br>Bruguiere said that the market for French passports was quite 
<br>strong, but that French police were increasingly able to 
<br>detect false papers when they came across them. Passports 
<br>from Maghreb countries were also in demand, said Bruguiere, 
<br>because holders of such passports were given visa-free entry 
<br>rights to Middle East countries, especially Syria. Bruguiere 
<br>said he remained confident regarding the ongoing trial of 
<br>Djamel Beghal and four of Beghal's associates. (The "Beghal 
<br>network" is accused of plotting to bomb the U.S. Embassy in 
<br>Paris.) Bruguiere said he had heard from prosecutorial 
<br>sources that Beghal's defense was not going well. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Bruguiere praised U.S.-French counter-terrorism 
<br>cooperation, and said he looked forward to continuing the 
<br>strong relationship his office had with USG interlocutors.
