<br> 
<br>¶1.  (C) Summary:  President Aliyev stated to the Ambassador 
<br>that the USG and international community's policy towards 
<br>Iran has "failed," that Iran is "confident, comfortable, and 
<br>unconstrained," that he "does not understand USG policy on 
<br>Iran" and, consequently, Azerbaijan's policy must be to 
<br>"minimize potential risks" to Azerbaijan.  Aliyev also said 
<br>that Iranian President Ahmadinejad has affirmed that he has 
<br>"burned his bridges" on the nuclear issue and warned Aliyev 
<br>directly that Iran will "attack from where it is attacked." 
<br>President Aliyev believes it is "always possible Iran will do 
<br>something against us."  President Aliyev's foreign policy 
<br>advisor and the Foreign Minister have voiced similar 
<br>concerns; the Foreign Minister has again told the Ambassador 
<br>that Iran is planning various scenarios in response to 
<br>heightened tensions or military action, which the GOAJ 
<br>believes will include a provocation against Azerbaijani 
<br>interests on the Caspian, where the international legal 
<br>framework remains unclear.  A recent anti-Azerbaijani 
<br>editorial which appeared in the Iranian newspaper Jomhouri 
<br>Eslami (reported incorrectly in the Azerbaijani press as 
<br>having been written by Supreme Leader Khamenei) appears to be 
<br>driving much of the GOAJ's concerns.  In sum, the GOAJ at the 
<br>most senior levels has communicated to us in stark terms 
<br>their concern about the implications for Azerbaijani security 
<br>of the current situation in Iran, and their desire to better 
<br>understand USG policy to address it - and its implications. 
<br>This will impact our ability to work with the GOAJ on a range 
<br>of issues; we need to address their concern.  End Summary.

<br>------------------------ 
<br>President Aliyev on Iran 
<br>------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (C) In a 23 November one-on-one meeting with the 
<br>Ambassador, President Aliyev raised in stark terms his view 
<br>that USG and the international community's policy on Iran has 
<br>"failed" and that Iran is "confident, comfortable, and 
<br>unconstrained."  Aliyev said that he "does not understand USG 
<br>policy" in response to this situation, adding that 
<br>Ahmadinejad has affirmed he has "burned his bridges" on the 
<br>nuclear issue and warned Aliyev directly that Iran will 
<br>"attack from where it is attacked."  Aliyev said he believes 
<br>it is "always possible Iran will do something against us" 
<br>(ref a) and Azerbaijan's policy must be to minimize potential 
<br>risks to itself.  Also as reported earlier, Aliyev's Foreign 
<br>Policy Advisor (ref b) and Foreign Minister Mammadyarov have 
<br>voiced similar concerns.  In a December 14 one-on-one 
<br>meeting, Foreign Minister told the Ambassador again that Iran 
<br>is planning various scenarios to respond to heightened 
<br>tensions or military action, which Azerbaijan believes will 
<br>include a provocation against Azerbaijani interests on the 
<br>Caspian, where the international legal framework remains 
<br>unclear. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br>Foreign Minister Mammadyarov on Iran 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C) In a December 14 one-on-one meeting with the 
<br>Ambassador, Foreign Minister Mammadyarov said that recent 
<br>Iranian activities (the fueling of demonstrations in Nardaran 
<br>with respect to the anti-Islam article published in Sanat, 
<br>recent demonstrations in front of the Azerbaijani Consulate 
<br>General and Embassy - ref c) are intended to "send a message 
<br>to us that they won't wait" while Azerbaijan moves towards 
<br>NATO and the US, and on a possible resolution of the Nagorno 
<br>Karabakh conflict.  He pointed to a recent statement by 
<br>Supreme Leader Khamenei that "Azerbaijan should not feel 
<br>comfortable with respect to NATO," saying Iran is "watching 
<br>our policy in this area very carefully."  In addition, he 
<br>said Iran "doesn't want us to make a move towards conflict 
<br>resolution because they know the conflict is the only serious 
<br>problem" facing Azerbaijan, and that if continued it keeps 
<br>Azerbaijan off base and under pressure.  He also said that 
<br>Russia's and Iran's positions on this are very close. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (C) Mammadyarov repeated what he had told the Ambassador 
<br>some months ago, that the Iranians are developing different 
<br>"scenarios" for how they will react if the US or Israel 
<br> 
<br>BAKU 00001835  002.2 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>increase the pressure on Iran over the nuclear issue. 
<br>Mammadyarov feels that Azerbaijan is a "target" for Iran if 
<br>there is the possibility of military action against Iran, 
<br>which Iran "definitely" sees as being on the table.  The GOAJ 
<br>thinks that a provocation of some kind on the Caspian will be 
<br>Iran's likely approach because whatever overt step Iran 
<br>takes, it will want to be within the framework of 
<br>international law, Mammadyarov said.  There is no agreement 
<br>on Caspian delimitation, the international legal framework is 
<br>murky and "that is where Azerbaijan is vulnerable."  However, 
<br>Mammadyarov also said that Azerbaijan believes Iran is 
<br>preparing scenarios for responses with respect to Lebanon, 
<br>Iraq and "even in Syria."  Iran is "afraid of the Taliban" 
<br>and hence slow to consider any steps in Afghanistan.  Iran 
<br>may also create difficulties with respect to its land border 
<br>with Nakhchivan (stopping buses, for example), with the aim 
<br>of turning the population against the GOAJ and provoking 
<br>"social problems" in Nakhchivan like those in Georgia. 
<br>According to Mammadyarov, Azerbaijan is planning to build a 
<br>railroad from Nakhchivan through Igdir, Turkey, as the next 
<br>stage of the Kars-Alkhakhalaki-Tbilisi railroad in order to 
<br>keep Nakhchivan from being cut off by Iran this way. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (C) Mammadyarov feels that Iran does not want Azerbaijan 
<br>to make a move on N-K resolution because the withdrawal of 
<br>Armenian troops from Azerbaijani territory will make 
<br>Azerbaijan stronger in the region.  Mammadyarov believes that 
<br>Iran does not want Azerbaijan, as a secular Muslim country, 
<br>to succeed as a model.  Poverty in the ethnic Azeri provinces 
<br>in the north of Iran is "like the middle ages" and as people 
<br>travel back and forth from Azerbaijan to Iran the contrast is 
<br>evident.  Mammadyarov argued that it is in Iran's national 
<br>interest to see the conflict continue, and, hence, the 
<br>Iranian government is exerting increased pressure at any sign 
<br>of steps towards a resolution. 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (C)  Speaking to the role of religion, Mammadyarov 
<br>asserted that Islam in Azerbaijan is more a matter of 
<br>"tradition" than ideology. Iran started playing with religion 
<br>with the Sanat article and in Nardaran, hoping for a 
<br>"uprising" from the people.  When this did not succeed, 
<br>Mammadyarov said that Iran's next step was the demonstrations 
<br>at the Azerbaijani Embassy and Consulate General (ref b).  He 
<br>argued that Iran's aim is to portray the Government of 
<br>Azerbaijan as bad Muslims, poor followers of Islam. 
<br>Azerbaijan is going to continue its westward orientation, 
<br>cooperation with NATO and the US but "without rhetoric to the 
<br>public," Mammadyarov said.  In Brussels, President Aliyev 
<br>made clear that Azerbaijan will "continue and deepen our 
<br>cooperation with NATO," moving to the second phase of its 
<br>Individual Partnership Action Plan (IPAP).  Mammadyarov said 
<br>that President Aliyev believes greater cooperation with NATO 
<br>and a greater NATO presence and involvement in the region 
<br>will bring predictability and stability.  He said Aliyev was 
<br>"very happy" with paragraph 43 of the Riga Summit statement; 
<br>its language on regional conflicts was a "clear message to 
<br>everyone north, south, east and west of Azerbaijan;" and, it 
<br>helps him push back on those of his advisors who question 
<br>what Azerbaijan gains from cooperation with NATO.

<br>Supreme Leader Khamenei's Alleged Anti-Azerbaijan Comments 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (C) A recent anti-Azerbaijani article which appeared in 
<br>Jomhouri Eslami, a conservative Tehran daily, appears to have 
<br>played a key role in raising concerns about Iran within 
<br>senior GOAJ circles.  The Azerbaijani press (to include the 
<br>opposition newspaper Azadliq) quoted Supreme Leader Khamenei 
<br>as having made numerous threats against Azerbaijan, even 
<br>claiming Azerbaijan to be part of Iran, characterizing it as 
<br>"Northern Iran" (a pointed dig at Azerbaijanis who refer to 
<br>Azeri-populated areas of Azerbaijan as "Southern 
<br>Azerbaijan").  In fact, the Jomhouri Eslami article widely 
<br>disseminated in the Azerbaijani press was an editorial piece, 
<br>not an article either written by or quoting the Supreme 
<br>Leader.  While critical of the Azerbaijani government 
<br>(focusing on issues such as the Sanat article and closer ties 
<br>with the US), the original editorial did not threaten 
<br>Azerbaijan in as dire terms as suggested by the Azerbaijani 
<br>media with reported quotes such as "we would like to remind 
<br>politicians in Azerbaijan that the IRI has adequate power to 
<br>realize the historic will of the people."

<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (C) Given the complex relations between Azerbaijan and 
<br>Iran, heated accusations in the press - and even overt 
<br>threats by Iran - are not uncommon.  The most recent 
<br>bilateral spat occurred in March 2006, when Iran accused the 
<br>GOAJ of supporting regime change by hosting in Baku a world 
<br>congress of Azerbaijanis (including "Southern Azerbaijanis" 
<br>who roundly criticized the IRI during the conference). 
<br>However, President Aliyev's and Foreign Minister 
<br>Mammadyarov's recent statements to the Ambassador reveal 
<br>increasing levels of GOAJ concern about Iranian intentions 
<br>and USG policy toward Iran.  Embassy contacts have also noted 
<br>that the level of Iranian rhetoric is sharper than in the 
<br>past (although their views likely are based on the somewhat 
<br>erroneous Azerbaijani press coverage of Iranian editorials). 
<br>The GOAJ at the most senior levels has communicated to us its 
<br>in stark terms concern about implications for Azerbaijani 
<br>security of the current situation in Iran, and their desire 
<br>to better understand USG policy to address it - and its 
<br>implications.  This will impact our ability to work with the 
<br>GOAJ on a range of issues; we need to address their concern. 
<br>We also note that the GOAJ has regular and broad contacts 
<br>with Iranian officials and Aliyev and his key advisors, if 
<br>engaged in regular dialogue, can provide us useful insights 
<br>on Iranian officials and intentions as seen from Baku.  The 
<br>Department's guidance on how to respond to Aliyev's concerns 
<br>is requested.
