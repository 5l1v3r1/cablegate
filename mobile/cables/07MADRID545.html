<br>
<br>Classified By: DCM Hugo Llorens, reasons 1.4 (B) and (D)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary. MFA Director General for Iberoamerica Javier
<br>Sandomingo informed DCM on March 23 that Spanish Foreign
<br>Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos plans to visit Cuba, though
<br>no date has been fixed. Sandomingo (strictly protect) shared
<br>this with the DCM during a readout of the March 17 visit to
<br>Madrid of Cuban FM Felipe Perez Roque, making clear that
<br>Moratinos himself was the strongest proponent of a high level
<br>Spanish visit to Cuba and that others in the media "and in
<br>the Zapatero Government" opposed such a visit. He said that
<br>MFA Secretary of State for Iberoamerica Trinidad Jimenez, who
<br>was on travel with the Royal family, had asked Sandomingo to
<br>brief the DCM on Moratinos' intention to visit Cuba, per her
<br>agreement to keep the USG informed (REF A). Sandomingo
<br>assessed that a Moratinos visit could help advance Spanish
<br>objectives in Cuba, including increased dialogue with
<br>potential post-Castro leaders, Cuban agreement to allow the
<br>resumption of Spain's development aid to Cuba, and the
<br>reopening of the Spanish Cultural Center in Havana that was
<br>shut down by Castro in 2003.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) The DCM asked whether Spanish officials saw any real
<br>signs of change in Cuban Government policy that would warrant
<br>such optimism or the symbolism of a high level Spanish visit,
<br>noting the Cuban Government's continued strong repression of
<br>dissidents. Sandomingo acknowledged that he did not see much
<br>evidence of substantial policy shifts in Cuba, but allowed
<br>that such changes might be taking place. He reviewed overall
<br>Spanish objectives in Cuba, saying the fundamental objective
<br>was to get the Cuban Government "to leave its people alone
<br>and let them lead normal lives." The DCM asked that the USG
<br>be informed immediately if a date was set for a Moratinos
<br>visit, noting that any surprises would be badly received by
<br>the USG since we had tried in good faith to coordinate Cuba
<br>policy with Spain. Sandomingo said that Trinidad Jimenez had
<br>emphasized with Moratinos the need to advise partners prior
<br>to making news of such a visit available to the press.
<br>Post's assessment is that Moratinos is indeed the driving
<br>force behind Spanish plans to visit Havana. The Zapatero
<br>Government's desire to firm up its left wing in the runup to
<br>key May 27 regional/municipal elections may be one factor in
<br>Moratinos' plans to go to Cuba, but his rivalry with Jimenez
<br>and his conviction that he can affect change in Cuba through
<br>good relations with Perez Roque may be more important
<br>considerations. The fact that this visit does not have
<br>unanimous support virtually guarantees that internal
<br>differences on this policy will be aired in the Spanish
<br>media. End Summary.
<br>
<br>//PEREZ ROQUE VISIT//
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) The DCM requested the meeting with Sandomingo to
<br>review the March 17 visit of Cuban FM Perez Roque (REF B).
<br>Sandomingo provided a brief readout, saying Perez Roque had
<br>mostly reviewed long-standing Cuban grievances, such as the
<br>EU Common Position, the existence of the 2003 EU Restrictive
<br>Measures on Cuba (suspended at Spain's behest in 2004), and
<br>the continuing elaboration of an EU strategic document
<br>regarding Cuba. Sandomingo discussed Spain's views on each
<br>of these issues, saying that the Common Position was not
<br>particularly effective, but it was the best available tool in
<br>the absence of EU consensus on how to deal with Cuba. He
<br>said that Spain had "nothing against" the development of a
<br>strategic document on Cuba at the EU level, but that the
<br>drafts shared by other EU members contained language that
<br>would guarantee a break in Cuban-EU relations. Sandomingo
<br>asserted that maintaining a principled stand on the need for
<br>democracy in Cuba was a key element of Spanish policy, but so
<br>was Spain's determination to keep open its channels to the
<br>Cuban leadership. The DCM noted that President Zapatero
<br>himself had recently publicly declared his preference for a
<br>democratic Cuba and suggested that further statements by
<br>Spanish officials along these lines would be very helpful in
<br>sending the right message to the Cuban leadership.
<br>
<br>//MORATINOS WANTS TO GO TO CUBA//
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Ending his review of Perez Roque's visit, Sandoming
<br>said that, at Trinidad Jimenez's request, he wanted the DCM
<br>to know that the MFA was working to lay the groundwork for a
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000545 002.2 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>Moratinos visit to Havana and that he (Sandomingo) would be
<br>going to Cuba on March 25 to establish the parameters for
<br>such a visit. Sandomingo said that he would not be going to
<br>Havana with proposed dates, but said that it was Moratinos'
<br>intention to visit Cuba. (NOTE: The conservative Spanish
<br>daily "ABC" reported March 23 that Moratinos planned to visit
<br>Cuba during the second half of April, despite mixed signals
<br>from Jimenez as to whether this trip was on the agenda. END
<br>NOTE). Sandomingo pointed to the controversial nature of
<br>this planned visit and said that he expected strong criticism
<br>of a Moratinos visit not only from the opposition Popular
<br>Party, but also from Spanish "media generally sympathetic to
<br>the Zapatero Government and from members of Zapatero's
<br>Government itself." However, he dismissed as irrelevant the
<br>media speculation surrounding contradictory public statements
<br>by Trinidad Jimenez this week regarding Cuba, telling the
<br>Spanish Senate on March 19 of MFA plans to visit Cuba, then
<br>telling a Parliamentary committee on March 21 that there were
<br>"no plans to visit Cuba."
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Sandomingo said that the Spanish Government saw Cuba
<br>as being in the initial phase of a period of change, though
<br>Fidel Castro's reemergence might delay progress for the time
<br>being. He said that Spain's primary objective at the moment
<br>was to promote stability in Cuba and to put itself in a
<br>position to influence the orientation of the post-Fidel Cuban
<br>leadership. He suggested (without much enthusiasm) that a
<br>Moratinos visit could advance specific Spanish objectives in
<br>Cuba, including:
<br>
<br>-- Cuban agreement to allow resumption of Spanish development
<br>programs in Cuba, unilaterally suspended by Cuba in 2003.
<br>Sandomingo said that, ideally, Spain could convince Havana to
<br>allow the resumption of all EU aid, but that the resumption
<br>of Spanish aid alone would represent a victory. He said that
<br>Spanish aid was aimed at fomenting the growth of Cuban civil
<br>society.
<br>
<br>-- Cuban agreement to reopen the Spanish Cultural Center in
<br>Havana shuttered by the Cuban authorities in 2003.
<br>Sandomingo said that he had opened the Cultural Center during
<br>his stint as charge d'affaires in Havana and that the first
<br>session had been a discussion of Spain's political transition
<br>(much to the annoyance of Cuban Government officials). He
<br>said that the Cultural Center had served as one of the few
<br>channels of uncensored information to the Cuban people and as
<br>a "free space" for Cuban intellectuals and other citizens.
<br>
<br>-- Launching discussions on Cuba's need to repay outstanding
<br>official short-term debt to Spain (REF C). Sandomingo
<br>assigned much lower priority to this objective, saying the
<br>political objectives were at the forefront of Spanish MFA
<br>efforts.
<br>
<br>//FEW SIGNS OF CHANGE//
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) The DCM asked whether Moratinos decision was final.
<br>Sandomingo said that the decision would not be finalized
<br>until dates for a visit had been fixed, but that he was
<br>certain that Moratinos wanted to go to Cuba. The DCM asked
<br>whether Spain saw any signs of positive change in Cuba that
<br>would warrant such a high level visit, noting that the regime
<br>continued to crack down on dissidents. Sandomingo
<br>acknowledged that he had not seen anything more than minor,
<br>unspecified indicators of a desire for change by Cuban
<br>officials. However, he allowed that change might be underway
<br>and that this could justify a Moratinos visit. Sandomingo
<br>reviewed Spain's objectives in Cuba, which he broadly defined
<br>as convincing the Cuban leadership to "leave its people alone
<br>and let them lead normal lives." He said that,
<br>unfortunately, Cuba's repressive apparatus had eliminated
<br>internal political pressure as a factor, but said that the
<br>poor socio-economic conditions experienced by the Cuban
<br>people represented a significant factor that did have to be
<br>taken into account by the Cuban Government. Spain's
<br>assessment is that some in the Cuban leadership, including
<br>around Raul Castro, agree with the need to cease harrassing
<br>the population and are open to reform. Sandomingo argued
<br>that it was important to encourage Cuba's post-Castro
<br>leaders, to make them feel less fearful of change and
<br>therefore more willing to accept a shift in the status quo.
<br>
<br>//KEEPING USG INFORMED//
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) The DCM underscored the importance of Spain
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000545 003.2 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>maintaining close consulations and a dialogue with the USG on
<br>Cuba and asked that the MFA advise the USG immediately if
<br>Moratinos confirmed his plans to travel to Cuba. The DCM
<br>reiterated A/S Shannon's request that Spain "not leave the
<br>USG alone" on Cuba and coordinate with us as much as
<br>possible, given our joint interest in a democratic Cuba. He
<br>laid down a marker, cautioning Sandomingo that any surprise
<br>announcement of a Moratinos visit to Havana would be badly
<br>received in Washington, particularly in light the USG's good
<br>faith effort to coordinate with Spain on Cuba policy. The
<br>DCM regretted that he had had to wait five days for a readout
<br>of the FM Perez Roque visit after having first requested such
<br>a meeting on March 19. Sandomingo said he fully agreed on
<br>the need for good communication and noted that Trinidad
<br>Jimenez had emphasized to Moratinos the need to brief key
<br>partners (meaning the USG) before announcing to the media any
<br>specific plans by him to visit Havana. On the issue of
<br>discussions with the USG, Sandomingo said that Trinidad
<br>Jimenez would likely be forced to postpone plans for an April
<br>visit to Washington and that May presented a better
<br>opportunity. Sandomingo confirmed that both he and Jimenez
<br>would be in Madrid for the May 17-18 conference organized by
<br>the Inter American Dialogue.
<br>
<br>//COMMENT//
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) While disappointing, Moratinos' planned visit to Cuba
<br>does not come a shock, given media reporting over the last
<br>few months of a possible visit. Post's assessment is that
<br>Moratinos is indeed the driving force behind Spanish plans to
<br>visit Havana. The Zapatero Government's desire to firm up
<br>its left wing in the runup to key May 27 regional/municipal
<br>elections may be one factor in Moratinos' plans to go to
<br>Cuba, but his rivalry with Jimenez and his conviction that he
<br>can affect change in Cuba through good relations with Perez
<br>Roque may be more important considerations. The Spanish
<br>Government is well aware of USG sensitivities on this issue
<br>(see REF A). The depth of internal differences within the
<br>Zapatero Government is somewhat surprising and reflects the
<br>varied expertise of those involved. Moratinos has little
<br>experience on Cuba and appears optimistic regarding his
<br>ability to change Cuban leadership behavior. By contrast,
<br>Trinidad Jimenez, Javier Sandomingo, and MFA DG for Foreign
<br>Policy Rafael Dezcallar have worked on Cuba for many years
<br>and are more skeptical of the Cuban leadership in general,
<br>and of Spain's capacity to change their behavior. In any
<br>case,the fact that this visit does not have unanimous GOS
<br>support virtually guarantees that internal differences on
<br>this policy will be aired in the Spanish media
