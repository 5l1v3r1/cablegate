<br>
<br>CLASSIFIED BY: Eric Wong, DCM, U.S. Department of State, U.S. Embassy, Djibouti; REASON: 1.4(D)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY.  U.S. security firm, Blackwater Worldwide (BW), has
<br>received permission from the Government of Djibouti to operate an
<br>armed ship from the port of Djibouti, to protect commercial
<br>shipping from pirates off the coast of Somalia.  Blackwater's
<br>U.S.-flagged ship is expected to arrive in early March, and will
<br>have a crew of 33 AmCits, including three 6-man armed teams who
<br>will operate in continuous shifts.  The Djiboutian Navy will secure
<br>Blackwater's weapons (i.e., .50-caliber machine guns) while ashore
<br>in Djibouti.  Blackwater does not intend to take any pirates into
<br>custody, but will use lethal force against pirates if necessary; it
<br>is developing an SOP that is currently under legal review and will
<br>be shared with the USG.  Blackwater's counter-piracy operation does
<br>not have any clients yet, but Blackwater expects business to
<br>develop following a public launch in Djibouti in March with GODJ
<br>officials.  END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) On Feb. 8, ex-FSO Robert Emmett Downey, Blackwater
<br>Worldwide's Development Manager for Africa, provided the following
<br>update to Amb. Swan, DCM, and Bob Patterson (TDY from Embassy
<br>Nairobi):
<br>
<br>a) Hassan Said Khaireh--triple-hatted as Djibouti's national
<br>security advisor, head of the security/intelligence service, and
<br>director of President Guelleh's Military Office--has given BW
<br>permission to operate its armed ship in Djibouti.  BW met with
<br>Hassan Said on Feb. 7, following an earlier meeting in WashDC
<br>between BW's CEO Erik Prince and Cofer Black with Djiboutian Amb.
<br>to the U.S. Robleh Olhaye.  This is the only such arrangement so
<br>far that BW has made with a host government in the region, but BW
<br>will likely engage Oman and Kenya in the future (e.g., in the event
<br>of a mechanical malfunction, the only facilities capable of
<br>repairing BW's ship are located in Mombasa.)  Within the USG, BW
<br>has briefed AFRICOM, CENTCOM, and Embassy Nairobi officials.
<br>
<br>b) BW's ship is the 'McArthur," a U.S.-flagged 183-foot ex-NOAA
<br>vessel.  While it has landing space for two helicopters, it will
<br>have an unarmed UAV, but no helicopters (which BW considers too
<br>expensive).  The ship will be armed with .50-caliber machine guns,
<br>and is able to protect a 3-ship convoy.  The Djiboutian Navy will
<br>secure BW's weapons, once ashore, and will inspect BW's weapons
<br>lockers.  According to Downey, BW's business concept--having its
<br>armed ship escort other ships requiring protection--is consistent
<br>with recent IMO/industry recommendations discouraging the carriage
<br>of firearms, or the presence of embarked armed security teams,
<br>aboard commercial ships themselves (e.g., see reftel, on the 85th
<br>session of the IMO Maritime Safety Committee).  The 'McArthur' will
<br>dock in Djibouti for 36-72 hours every 30 days, to replenish its
<br>stores.  According to Downey, BW is the only such firm with its own
<br>ship.
<br>
<br>c) All personnel on BW's ship will be U.S. citizens:  comprising 15
<br>crew and 18 armed security personnel (three 6-man teams who will
<br>operate in continuous 8-hour shifts).  These 33 "operators" will
<br>rotate every 60 days.  For medical contingencies, BW has
<br>arranged--through its local agent in Djibouti, Inchcape
<br>(London-based international shipper with numerous business
<br>activities in Djibouti)--access to Bouffard, the French military
<br>hospital in Djibouti.  The 'McArthur" will arrive in Djibouti in
<br>early March, after transitting Gilbraltar and Acaba, Jordan.  BW
<br>CEO Erik Prince plans to travel to DJ for its public launch.
<br>
<br>d) Downey underscored BW's emphasis on compliance with U.S. laws,
<br>including defense trade controls:  BW has a VP for export
<br>compliance, and depends on the USG (DOD) for contracts.  BW's ship,
<br>the 'McArthur", will have video cameras to record BW counter-piracy
<br>activities.
<br>
<br>e) BW has no intention of taking any pirates into custody.  While
<br>the French have previously put pirates ashore in Puntland, Downey
<br>said BW had no plans to do so, either in Somalia or Kenya (noting
<br>that Kenya's bilateral PUC agreements with the USG and HMG were
<br>government-to-government).  BW will share its SOP with Embassies
<br>Djibouti and Nairobi once approved; SOP is currently under legal
<br>review, as there is "no precedent for a paramilitary operation in a
<br>purely commercial environment."  While asserting that international
<br>maritime law allows the use of lethal force against pirates, BW
<br>
<br>DJIBOUTI 00000113  002 OF 002
<br>
<br>also recognizes the need to respect international humanitarian
<br>obligations.  Of concern, for example, is whether BW would be
<br>responsible for assisting injured pirates, if doing so endangered
<br>BW's ability to protect its client(s).
<br>
<br>f) BW's local agent in Djibouti is Inchcape.  Bruno Pardigon,
<br>general manager of the newly formed "Djibouti Maritime Security
<br>Services" (DMSS), will provide BW with a license, following
<br>completion of an MOU with DMSS.  Downey was unsure whether DMSS was
<br>a parastatal or a quasi-government agency of the GODJ.  [COMMENT:
<br>Pardigon is favorably known to the Embassy as a French-Djiboutian
<br>businessman and marine conservationist who runs a diving operation
<br>in Djibouti.]  While Downey will remain in Djibouti until March
<br>2009, BW has no plans now to establish an office in Djibouti.
<br>
<br>g) While protection is estimated to cost less than $200,000 per
<br>trip, BW's Djibouti operation has no contracts yet for clients.
<br>Downey commented that the shipping industry may assess that piracy
<br>is declining:  only 3 ships were pirated in January 2009; there are
<br>at least 4 foreign naval vessels currently docked in Djibouti
<br>conducting counter-piracy operations; and the EU's Operation
<br>Atalanta is providing military escort of ships.
<br>
<br>¶3. (U) COMMENT.  Djibouti's decision to permit Blackwater to begin
<br>counter-piracy operations follows ongoing GODJ efforts aimed at
<br>addressing the piracy threat.  Djibouti recently hosted an IMO
<br>conference on Somali piracy that, inter alia, recommended Djibouti
<br>serve as a center for maritime training.  Numerous foreign military
<br>counter-piracy operations are based in Djibouti--involving units
<br>from Spain, France, the UK, the Netherlands, and other EU members.
<br>Japan (septel) and Korea are also considering military deployments
<br>to Djibouti to support counter-piracy efforts.  Djibouti is a
<br>founding member of the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of
<br>Somalia (CGPCS) and has offered to host the group's planned
<br>Counter-Piracy Coordination Cell.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED.  Blackwater's presence in Djibouti would
<br>make it one of the largest U.S. businesses operating in the
<br>country.  As the host of the only U.S. military base in Africa, as
<br>well as a country with extensive commercial port facilities,
<br>Djibouti has a commercial interest in supporting foreign investors,
<br>including U.S. contractors.  Blackwater executives seek to involve
<br>both Djiboutian and USG principals in a high-profile March 2009
<br>launch; Post would appreciate Department's guidance on the
<br>appropriate level of engagement with Blackwater, while also
<br>fulfilling the USG's commercial advocacy responsibilities to
<br>support U.S. firms.  END COMMENT.
