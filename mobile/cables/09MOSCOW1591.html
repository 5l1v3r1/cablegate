<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: A decision to move towards a more robust 
<br>military relationship with Georgia will imperil our efforts 
<br>to re-start relations with Russia, if it is not carefully 
<br>calibrated and deployed. While Medvedev understands the 
<br>strategic and personal benefits of crafting a productive 
<br>partnership with the U.S., this impulse is trumped by the 
<br>GOR's "absolute" priority placed on expanding Russian 
<br>influence in the Eurasian neighborhood, preventing NATO 
<br>enlargement, and demonstrating Russia's great power status. 
<br>The Russian political class and populace is united behind 
<br>these principles, with the August war confirming for the 
<br>leadership that the international community lacks the levers 
<br>to coerce a change in Russian behavior. Russian criticism of 
<br>PfP exercises was both sincere -- anger over the "business as 
<br>usual" approach with Saakashvili -- and tactical, designed to 
<br>raise the costs of CIS cooperation with the West, but was not 
<br>matched by a change in military posture. However, given 
<br>consistent warnings over the consequences of weapons sales to 
<br>Georgia, we believe a lethal military supply relationship 
<br>with Tbilisi would come at the cost of advancing Georgia's 
<br>territorial integrity, and could lessen Russian restraint on 
<br>weapons transfers to Iran. We believe that keeping the focus 
<br>on Georgia's economic and democratic development, while 
<br>continuing our military cooperation with Tbilisi through 
<br>transparent PfP programming with European partners, and 
<br>non-lethal bilateral mil-mil training and assistance, is the 
<br>only viable -- if very long-term -- strategy to induce better 
<br>Russian behavior and restore Georgian territorial integrity. 
<br>Critical to this effort will be building ballast in a 
<br>U.S.-Russian relationship that serves as a break on Russia's 
<br>worst instincts. End Summary 
<br>
<br>Showdown Over Georgia? 
<br>---------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) If not carefully calibrated and deployed, a decision 
<br>to move towards a more robust military relationship with 
<br>Georgia has the very real potential to trigger a dispute on a 
<br>set of issues that are both neuralgic and strategic for the 
<br>Russian political and military establishment, endangering the 
<br>Administration's effort to undertake a fresh start with 
<br>Moscow. While Medvedev appears seized with taking charge of 
<br>the U.S.-Russian account and placing it on a new footing 
<br>during the July summit, this policy impulse will be 
<br>subordinate to Russia's "strategic interests" in its Eurasian 
<br>neighborhood, as defined by both Medvedev and Putin. Russian 
<br>intransigence on the UNOMIG rollover is a conspicuous 
<br>illustration of this. We cannot accept this Russian 
<br>calculus, but we need to understand what drives the Kremlin 
<br>and White House: 
<br>
<br>-- Russia places an "absolute" priority on expanding its 
<br>influence and deepening its integration with neighboring 
<br>states, as part of a self-conscious policy to combat the 
<br>West's "creep" towards its borders (ref a). Inevitably, the 
<br>question of Russia's status in the Eurasian "neighborhood," 
<br>and the presumed zero-sum competition for influence along 
<br>Russia's borders, will remain our most contentious bilateral 
<br>issue and the likeliest stumbling block to improved 
<br>U.S.-Russian relations. 
<br>
<br>-- Russia opposes any further enlargement of NATO. The 
<br>August war in Georgia signaled Moscow's readiness to expend 
<br>materiel and men to achieve this goal, even at the cost of 
<br>international opprobrium. The fact that NATO membership for 
<br>both Georgia and Ukraine is not a front burner priority has 
<br>not tempered Moscow's stance, since the Russian leadership 
<br>sees this as a temporary reprieve, brought about by European 
<br>reservations and not by a change in policy by the Obama 
<br>Administration. 
<br>
<br>-- Absent a standstill agreement on NATO, which Medvedev 
<br>hopes to achieve through discussions over a new European 
<br>Security Treaty, Russia presumes that we seek its strategic 
<br>neutering. Our principled rejection of a Russian sphere of 
<br>influence is read here as a denial of Russia's status as a 
<br>great power, and another example of U.S. "double standards," 
<br>rather than a repudiation of a Warsaw Pact mentality. 
<br>
<br>-- Russia judges that we lack the bilateral or multilateral 
<br>levers to coerce it into moderating its stance on Georgia or 
<br>reversing its recognition of the conflict territories. 
<br>Moscow assumes that we have too many strategic interests in 
<br>common to credibly threaten Russia with a cut-off in 
<br>relations -- a move that Europe (both old and new) never 
<br>
<br>MOSCOW 00001591 002 OF 003 
<br>
<br>seriously contemplated in the wake of the Georgian war. 
<br>
<br>-- Russian leaders enjoy a policy carte blanche on Georgia, 
<br>with respect to domestic public opinion. Polls consistently 
<br>show that Russians overwhelmingly welcome Moscow's resurgent 
<br>foreign policy, revile Saakashvili, and blame Euro-Atlantic 
<br>institutions for Moscow's worsening relations with former 
<br>republics and Warsaw Pact partners. There is absolutely no 
<br>difference between Medvedev and Putin when it comes to 
<br>Georgia. 
<br>
<br>Russian Warnings Over Mil-Mil Relations 
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Russia has used the previously scheduled Cooperative 
<br>Longbow/Cooperative Lancer PfP exercises and U.S./NATO 
<br>discussions of Georgian military reform to hint at a 
<br>political price tag for continued cultivation of Georgia as a 
<br>NATO aspirant. While Russian Ambassador to NATO Rogozin's 
<br>characterization of the exercises as "an absurdity and 
<br>madness" were discounted in NATO circles, he accurately 
<br>channeled Moscow's anger over what was seen as a "business as 
<br>usual" policy towards Saakashvili, as well as Moscow's 
<br>strategy of raising the potential costs of participation by 
<br>other CIS states. Medvedev labeled the exercises 
<br>"muscle-flexing," an "outright provocation," and "a mistaken 
<br>and dangerous decision," while Putin questioned the "reset" 
<br>in U.S.-Russian relations, pointing to the exercises as a 
<br>"signal in a different direction." Even mild-mannered DFM 
<br>Ryabkov fulminated publicly against the "cheap and 
<br>unconvincing arguments" used to justify PfP. Pro-Kremlin and 
<br>opposition politicians emphasized that a "return to last 
<br>August" or a "new Cold War" might flow from a continued NATO 
<br>embrace of Tbilisi. Despite the harsh rhetoric, however, 
<br>Russia did not place its troops on alert during the 
<br>exercises, which proceeded smoothly. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) When it comes to weapons sales to Tbilisi, Russian 
<br>actions have been harsher. For those few Russian officials 
<br>willing to believe that the U.S. did not directly goad 
<br>Georgia into attacking, it is an article of faith that 
<br>Georgia's military relationship with the U.S. triggered 
<br>Saakashvili's fateful miscalculation on August 8. While 
<br>accusing Georgia of 30-fold increases in military spending 
<br>(at 7-8 percent of GDP), in addition to illicit purchases 
<br>from Ukrainian and Israeli middlemen, and an overconfidence 
<br>spawned by U.S. assurances of support, the GOR called for an 
<br>arms embargo against Georgia in the war's aftermath. 
<br>Invoking OSCE and UN conventions against the provision of 
<br>offensive weapons to conflict zones, Medvedev then 
<br>promulgated a January presidential decree allowing for 
<br>unilateral sanctions against countries that assist Tbilisi in 
<br>its "remilitarization." Both Medvedev and Putin appear to 
<br>believe that the U.S. already has supplied Tbilisi 
<br>surreptitiously with arms, which illustrates the invidious 
<br>role, as well as dominance, of the security services in 
<br>running Russian policy in the Caucasus. 
<br>
<br>A Better Focus: Economy, CBMS, and PfP 
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) From our perspective, the challenge is to 
<br>demonstrate that the U.S. will protect its legitimate 
<br>interests in the Caucasus -- including support for Georgian 
<br>sovereignty, territorial integrity and the democratically 
<br>elected government of Georgia -- without triggering a 
<br>tit-for-tat military escalation that we cannot win, but that 
<br>Georgia can surely lose. From our vantage point, a 
<br>burgeoning military supply relationship with Georgia is more 
<br>of a liability for Georgia than a benefit. It would do 
<br>nothing to secure a long-term resolution of Abkhazia and 
<br>South Ossetia, allowing Russia to "justify" its military 
<br>buildup in the conflict territories, increasing the 
<br>insecurities of the Abkhaz and South Ossetian populations 
<br>already distrustful of Saakashvili, and driving the 
<br>separatist leaders further into Moscow's arms. It would 
<br>almost certainly raise the temperature, rather than 
<br>maintaining the unsatisfactory status quo long enough for 
<br>economic development and confidence-building measures to chip 
<br>away at the current hostile standoff. The ramifications of a 
<br>policy clash on weapons sales could also be felt elsewhere, 
<br>with Moscow seizing a pretext to move forward on the delivery 
<br>of S-300s to Iran. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) As we have argued separately (ref b), the U.S. will 
<br>be most effective in countering Russian actions by acting in 
<br>concert with Europe to help Georgia demonstrate to the Abkhaz 
<br>and South Ossetians that autonomy with Tbilisi is better than 
<br>submission to Russia. Russian corruption, heavy-handedness 
<br>and reliance on criminalized local leaders ultimately will 
<br>
<br>MOSCOW 00001591 003 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>play to Georgia's advantage. While Georgia cannot reconquer 
<br>its lost territory by force, it can establish itself as a 
<br>democratically vibrant and economically successful model for 
<br>the region. By keeping the international focus on economic 
<br>assistance to Tbilisi and on creating credible international 
<br>monitoring regimes, we can create the time and space to 
<br>intensify cooperation with Russia in other areas of strategic 
<br>interest, adding ballast to the U.S.-Russian relationship 
<br>that could make Moscow think twice about exacerbating 
<br>tensions in the Caucasus. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) This is not to say that the U.S. should be 
<br>constrained in providing bilateral non-lethal military 
<br>assistance, training, or other equipment clearly directed at 
<br>assisting Georgia's basic requirements to control its 
<br>borders, maintain law and order and counter terrorism. In 
<br>addition, we believe that PfP exercises and programs should 
<br>be pursued as part of the standard NATO toolbox for 
<br>cooperation with non-member states, notwithstanding Russian 
<br>rhetorical umbrage. The value of building Georgian capacity 
<br>for international peacekeeping, counter-narcotics, 
<br>civil-military emergency preparedness, and anti-terrorism 
<br>operations is obvious. PfP has the advantage of greater 
<br>transparency and reinforcing a common U.S.-European approach 
<br>to Georgia; conceivably, when relations stabilize, Russia 
<br>could be included as an observer. While Russian forces will 
<br>remain concentrated in the neighboring territories for the 
<br>near-term, our goal of securing a Russian drawdown and then 
<br>departure will not be accomplished through a U.S. military 
<br>sales relationship or lethal training program. Instead, we 
<br>should hold Medvedev accountable to the principles of his 
<br>European Security Treaty initiative, which are based on 
<br>respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty. 
<br>
<br>Comment: U.S.-Russia Relations Matter 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) We in no way accede to Russian redlines by 
<br>acknowledging that Georgia could never win a military 
<br>confrontation with Russia, and should not be encouraged to 
<br>pursue a strategy that focuses on military force as the 
<br>underpinning to a stronger, more stable country. We 
<br>recognize that our suggested approach would be deeply 
<br>dissatisfying to Saakashvili, but we see no short-term fix to 
<br>the generational estrangement triggered by the August war and 
<br>no way to neutralize the advantages of geography, size, and 
<br>capabilities enjoyed by Russia. Instead, consistent and 
<br>coordinated initiatives by the U.S. and Europe to assist 
<br>Georgia, implement monitoring regimes, and persuade Russia to 
<br>engage credibly will be better advanced in an environment 
<br>where the U.S. and Russia are not in a hostile standoff. Our 
<br>assessment is that if we say "yes" to a significant military 
<br>relationship with Tbilisi, Russia will say "no" to any 
<br>medium-term diminution in tensions, and feel less constrained 
<br>absent reverting to more active opposition to critical U.S. 
<br>strategic interests.
