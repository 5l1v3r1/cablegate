<br>SUBJECT: NOTIFICATION OF AFFECTED STATES: HIJACKING OF BELIZE-FLAGGED
<br>CARGO SHIP M/V FAINA, IMO NUMBER 9419377
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) This message is NIACT due to potential fast-breaking
<br>events, and urgent action is required from action addressees.
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) Classified by Acting DAS James Knight, Reasons 1.4
<br>(b) and (d).
<br>¶3. (U) This is an action request. Please see paragraphs 4-7.
<br>
<br>OBJECTIVES
<br>----------
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/Rel to Ukraine) For Embassy Kyiv, please approach host-country
<br>officials to pursue the objectives set out below. In discussing these
<br>points, please emphasize that at this stage we are only gathering
<br>information, including the views of interested parties. While we
<br>believe
<br>it is extremely important to ensure the cargo of the FAINA is not
<br>offloaded in Somalia, we are eager to consult with the flag and crew
<br>states prior to taking action to prevent that scenario. Our contact
<br>is therefore meant to inform our decisions about how to proceed in
<br>this matter.
<br>
<br>-- Convey the United States' sympathy and concern for the safety
<br>and well-being of the crew member nationals on board the FAINA.
<br>
<br>-- Explain that the nature of the vessel's cargo and its potential
<br>diversion by terrorists pose a grave threat to security in the region.
<br>
<br>-- Note that among the available options for preventing this scenario
<br>would be to disable and/or board the vessel.
<br>
<br>-- Ask for Ukraine's views with respect to possible United States
<br>military action to prevent the hijackers from delivering the FAINA's
<br>cargo into Somalia. Such intervention could include disabling fire
<br>against
<br>the vessel or equipment being used to offload ("lighterage")
<br>it,
<br>or boarding the vessel. Emphasize that we would only consider such
<br>actions as a last resort to prevent the cargo from being taken ashore
<br>by
<br>the pirates or other malafides. If the pirates simply hold the vessel
<br>for ransom, as they have in the past, we would not intervene in this
<br>manner. Thus, we are consulting with Ukraine now regarding the
<br>possible range of options open to us.
<br>
<br>-- Note, however, that the United States reserves the right to take
<br>urgent action if necessary.
<br>
<br>-- We are of course aware that the opposed boarding of any vessel
<br>creates
<br>a risk to the lives of the crewmembers, so we are especially
<br>interested
<br>in Ukraine's views regarding such measures, should that situation
<br>arise.
<br>-- Request information on the ship specifications, including draft.
<br>
<br>-- Inquire into host nation's authorities, willingness,
<br>and ability to
<br>assist the U.S. in bringing
<br>the pirates aboard the FAINA
<br>to justice
<br>consistent with UN Security Council Resolution 1816. Seek information
<br>on
<br>any conditions precedent or particular procedural requirements that
<br>would
<br>enable the host government to accept custody of, investigate,
<br>and prosecute
<br>any persons apprehended in conjunction
<br>with the piracy
<br>of the FAINA.
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/Rel to Russia, Latvia) For Embassies Moscow and Riga, please
<br>approach host-country officials to pursue the following objectives:
<br>
<br>-- Convey the United States' sympathy and concern for the safety and
<br>well-being of the crew member nationals on board the FAINA.
<br>
<br>-- Explain that the nature of the vessel's cargo and its potential
<br>diversion by terrorists pose a grave threat to security in the region.
<br>
<br>-- Note that among the available options for preventing this scenario
<br>would be to disable and/or board the vessel.
<br>
<br>-- Ask for Russia's/Latvia's views with respect to possible
<br>United States
<br>military action to prevent the hijackers from delivering the FAINA's
<br>cargo into Somalia. Such intervention could include disabling fire
<br>against the vessel or equipment being used to offload ("lighterage")
<br>it,
<br>or boarding the vessel. Emphasize that we would only consider such
<br>actions as a last resort to prevent the cargo from being taken ashore
<br>by
<br>the pirates or other malafides. If the pirates simply hold the vessel
<br>for ransom, as they have in the past, we would not intervene in this
<br>manner. Thus, we are consulting with Russia/Latvia now regarding the
<br>possible range of options open to us.
<br>
<br>-- Note, however, that the United States reserves the right to take
<br>urgent action if necessary.
<br>
<br>-- We are of course aware that the opposed boarding of any vessel
<br>create
<br>a risk to the lives of the crewmembers, so we are especially
<br>interested
<br>in Russia's/Latvia's views regarding such measures, should that
<br>situation arise.
<br>
<br>-- Inquire into host nation's authorities, willingness,
<br>and ability to
<br>assist the U.S. in bringing the pirates aboard the FAINA to justice
<br>consistent with UN Security Council Resolution 1816. Seek information
<br>on
<br>any conditions precedent or particular procedural requirements that
<br>would
<br>enable the host government to accept custody of, investigate,
<br>and
<br>prosecute any persons apprehended in conjunction with
<br>the piracy of the FAINA.
<br>
<br>-- Note that we are aware that a Russian navy vessel is en route
<br>to the area,
<br>apparently in response to these events, and inquire as to Russia's
<br>intentions with respect to this vessel. Urge Russia to coordinate
<br>any planned actions with the United States.
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/Rel to Belize) For Embassy Belize, please approach host-country
<br>officials to pursue the following objectives:
<br>
<br>-- Convey the United States' sympathy and concern for the safety and
<br>well-being of the crew members on board the
<br>Belize-flagged roll on-roll
<br>off cargo ship FAINA, IMO number 7419377.
<br>
<br>-- Explain that the nature of the vessel's cargo and its potential
<br>diversion by terrorists pose a grave threat to security in the region.
<br>
<br>-- Note that among the available options for preventing this scenario
<br>would be to disable and/or board the vessel.
<br>
<br>-- Ask for Belize's views with respect to possible United States
<br>military
<br>action to prevent the hijackers from delivering the FAINA's cargo into
<br>Somalia. Such intervention could include disabling fire against
<br>the vessel
<br>or equipment being used to offload ("lighterage") it, or boarding
<br>the vessel. Emphasize that we would only consider such actions
<br>as a last
<br>resort to prevent the cargo from being taken ashore by pirates or
<br>other
<br>malafides. If the pirates simply hold the vessel for ransom, as they
<br>have in the past, we would not intervene in this manner. Thus, we are
<br>consulting with Belize now regarding the possible range of options
<br>open to us.
<br>
<br>-- Ask for concurrence with possible United States military action to
<br>prevent the hijackers from delivering the FAINA's cargo into Somalia.
<br>Such intervention
<br>would include disabling fire or borardingv the vessel and
<br>would only be used as a last resort to prevent the cargo from being
<br>taken ashore by the pirates or other malafides.
<br>
<br>-- Note, however, that the United States reserves the right to take
<br>urgent action if necessary.
<br>
<br>--Request information on the ship specifications, including draft.
<br>
<br>-- Inquire into host nation's authorities, willingness,
<br>and ability to
<br>assist the U.S. in bringing the pirates aboard the FAINA to
<br>justice
<br>consistent with UN Security Council Resolution 1816. Seek
<br>information on
<br>any
<br>conditions precedent or particular procedural requirements that
<br>would
<br>enable the host government to accept custody of, investigate, and
<br>prosecute
<br>any persons apprehended in conjunction with the piracy of the
<br>FAINA.
<br>
<br>¶7. (S/Rel to Kenya) For Embassy Nairobi, please approach host-country
<br>officials to pursue the following objectives:
<br>-- Convey the United States' sympathy and concern for the safety and
<br>well-being of the crew members on board the FAINA.
<br>
<br>-- Explain that the nature of the vessel's cargo and its potential
<br>diversion by terrorists pose a grave threat to security in the region.
<br>
<br>-- Note that among the available options for preventing this scenario
<br>would be to disable and/or board the vessel.
<br>
<br>-- Ask for Kenya's views with respect to possible United States
<br>military
<br>action to prevent the hijackers from delivering the FAINA's cargo
<br>into
<br>Somalia. Such intervention could include disabling fire against the
<br>vessel or equipment being used to offload ("lighterage") it,
<br>or boarding
<br>the vessel. Emphasize that we would only consider such actions
<br>as a last
<br>resort to prevent the cargo from being taken ashore by pirates or
<br>other
<br>malafides. If the pirates simply hold the vessel for ransom, as they
<br>have in the past, we would not intervene in this manner. Thus, we are
<br>consulting with Kenya now regarding the possible range of options
<br>open to us.
<br>
<br>-- Note, however, that the United States reserves the right to take
<br>urgent action if necessary.
<br>
<br>-- Inquire into host nation's authorities, willingness,
<br>and ability to
<br>assist the U.S. in bringing the pirates aboard the FAINA
<br>to justice
<br>consistent with UN Security Council Resolution 1816. Seek information
<br>on any conditions precedent or particular procedural requirements
<br>that would
<br>enable the host government to accept custody of, investigate,
<br>and
<br>prosecute any persons apprehended in conjunction with
<br>the piracy
<br>of the
<br>FAINA.
<br>-- Indicate that we will seek--but cannot guarantee--that these
<br>weapons
<br>will be resent on their original route to Kenya for onward delivery,
<br>if recovered.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>BACKGROUND
<br>----------
<br>
<br>¶8. (S) The Belize-flagged roll on-roll off cargo ship FAINA was
<br>hijacked
<br>on September 25 while en route to Mombasa, Kenya and was last reported
<br>approximately 280 NM ENE of Mogadishu. FAINA departed Nikolayev,
<br>Ukraine on September 1. One Latvian, three Russian, and 17 Ukrainian
<br>crewmembers are on board.
<br>
<br>¶9. (S) As part of a contract signed between Ukraine and the Sudanese
<br>People's Liberation Movement/Army in December 2006, the vessel is
<br>believed to be carrying the following cargo intended for transshipment
<br>to southern Sudan:
<br>
<br>-- 33 T-72 tanks, with spare parts
<br>-- 42 ZPU-4 rolling anti-aircraft guns
<br>-- 36 RPG-7v
<br>-- 6 BM-27 Self propelled multiple rocket launchers
<br>-- 13,000 125mm rounds of ammunition (T-72)
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) The Department is deeply concerned that the armaments
<br>may fall
<br>into al-Shabaab's hands if off-loaded from the vessel in Somalia.
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) The USS Howard has been dispatched to intercept and take up a
<br>position from which to monitor the FAINA.
<br>
