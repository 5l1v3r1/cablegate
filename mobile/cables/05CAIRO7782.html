<br>SUBJECT: PDAS LIZ CHENEY'S SEPTEMBER 28 MEETING WITH GAMAL 
<br>MUBARAK 
<br>
<br>Classified by DCM Stuart Jones for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br>
<br>------- 
<br>Summary 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) In a September 28 meeting with PDAS Elizabeth 
<br>Cheney, Gamal Mubarak, head of the NDP Policies Committee, 
<br>reviewed his father's presidential election campaign, which 
<br>he argued had been a major success. He also reviewed the 
<br>ruling party's preparations for the upcoming parliamentary 
<br>elections. PDAS Cheney reminded Gamal of the paramount 
<br>importance that the USG places on international monitoring 
<br>and urged him to use his influence to encourage the GOE/NDP 
<br>to undertake other concrete improvements in the electoral 
<br>process. Significant improvements in the parliamentary 
<br>elections, the PDAS noted, would be crucial to continuing 
<br>Egypt's democratic reform progress. End summary. 
<br>

<br>The NDP's Campaign Architect Reviews His Creation 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) PDAS Cheney, joined by DAS Carpenter, Charge, and 
<br>poloff (notetaker) met with Gamal Mubarak on September 28 to 
<br>discuss Egypt's political reform progress. Gamal opened the 
<br>meeting with questions about Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. 
<br>PDAS Cheney updated Gamal on cleanup and recovery efforts and 
<br>thanked him for GOE relief supplies. The Charge noted that 
<br>Washington had been gratified by the speed of the GOE airlift 
<br>to supply water, blankets, and other items. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Turning to the September 7 presidential election, 
<br>Gamal noted that he and his NDP colleagues had been working 
<br>on the campaign since the end of June, when President Mubarak 
<br>had indicated that "he wanted a proper campaign team." Gamal 
<br>said the team, which included Ahmad Ezz and Mohammad Kamal, 
<br>used focus groups and polling to fine tune the President's 
<br>message. After the campaign team devised a "credible 
<br>program," which the NDP "simplified" to address focus group 
<br>concerns, the party used the campaign period (August 
<br>17-September 3) to reach out to voters. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Gamal noted that his father had directed the party 
<br>to "run a positive campaign," and to respond only to attacks 
<br>that misrepresented policy. Gamal attributed the NDP's 
<br>success to a packed schedule of campaign events (nearly one 
<br>major event per day) along with DVC outreach to provincial 
<br>party leaders, and personal letters from the President to 
<br>each of the party's 7000 "basic unit leaders" (i.e., precinct 
<br>bosses). According to Gamal, the precinct bosses were 
<br>"absolutely crucial" and the "backbone" of an effort to "fire 
<br>up" youthful NDP voters. In response to a question by the 
<br>PDAS, Gamal said that his father had much enjoyed the 
<br>"intensity" of the campaign as well as his engagement with 
<br>party activists. Gamal said that the final event of the 
<br>campaign, the closing rally at Abdeen Palace in Cairo, had 
<br>been a "big success," since it linked the President to key 
<br>episodes in Egyptian historical memory. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) The PDAS noted the USG's continuing encouragement of 
<br>the GOE to invite international observers, and pressed Gamal 
<br>to identify areas that he though could be improved in future 
<br>elections. Gamal described Egypt's outdated and incoherent 
<br>voter lists as "not a huge issue," but noted that cleaning 
<br>them up would be a long-term project. He blamed the low 
<br>turnout of the presidential election (about 7 million voters 
<br>or 23 percent) on overzealous judges supervising the 
<br>September 7 ballot who had, allegedly, refused to allow more 
<br>than one voter at a time into polling stations, and thereby 
<br>diminished turnout. "We were aiming for at least nine 
<br>million voters, but many people went home without voting 
<br>because of the queues," Gamal said. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Gamal termed the controversy over domestic observers 
<br>on election day as "a huge mess," and noted that the party 
<br>had tried to play a constructive role on this issue, behind 
<br>the scenes, despite the obstructionism of the Presidential 
<br>Election Commission and some of the judges. The PDAS 
<br>reiterated the USG's views on international monitors and 
<br>urged him to use his influence in support of both 
<br>international and domestic monitors. 
<br>
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br>Plans for the Parliamentary Elections 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Turning to the parliamentary elections, which will 
<br>be held in three stages beginning on November 8, Gamal said 
<br>that a central difference with the presidential campaign 
<br>would be that campaigning for the 444 parliamentary races 
<br>"would be the party's effort, not the President's." The 
<br>President plans to campaign on behalf of some candidates, 
<br>however and the Party plans to use the same Heliopolis 
<br>campaign headquarters and core team, although this team will 
<br>be "adjusted for the battle." 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) The PDAS asked how the party plans to select its 
<br>candidates. Gamal noted that the party's selection process 
<br>hadn't worked in the past, since it permitted candidates with 
<br>deep pockets to win the party endorsement even if they were 
<br>not able to win at the polls. (Note: In the 2000 elections, 
<br>official NDP candidates won less than 40 percent of the 
<br>seats. Most winners were so-called "NDP independents" who 
<br>had not managed to secure the party's endorsement but 
<br>nevertheless prevailed at the poll and eventually rejoined 
<br>the party, thereby giving the NDP its lock on Parliament. 
<br>End note.) 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Gamal provided an overview of the new process. He 
<br>said that the party would hold "primaries" during the first 
<br>week of October, which would assemble precinct bosses and 
<br>other grass roots leaders to bet potential candidates. Gamal 
<br>said that in addition to this popularity contest, the party 
<br>would use polling, analysis of the voting in the presidential 
<br>election, and a "software" analysis to create a single 
<br>consolidated party slate of candidates. 
<br>
<br>------------------------------------------- 
<br>But How Will They Be Better than Last Time? 
<br>------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Gamal said that the parliamentary elections would 
<br>be "both messier and easier" than the presidential election. 
<br>The PDAS pressed Gamal to suggest steps that the GOE could 
<br>take in the next few weeks to demonstrate its commitment to 
<br>political reform. In response to the PDAS's inquiry about 
<br>the GOE utilizing transparent ballot boxes in place of the 
<br>existing wooden boxes, Gamal described them as "cosmetic." 
<br>For Egypt, he said, the key is judicial supervision. Gamal 
<br>also dismissed alleged problems with indelible ink, multiple 
<br>voting, and voting by unregistered citizens. All of these 
<br>allegations, he said, were "unfounded." 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) More important, he argued had been the information 
<br>deficit. Voters had sometimes not known which polling 
<br>stations to report to, and the lists of registered voters had 
<br>not been widely available ahead of time. Improving the 
<br>available information about the polling station locations and 
<br>access was Gamal's highest priority. "If I was in charge," 
<br>he said, "this is what I'd do." 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) The PDAS ask Gamal about the period after the 
<br>parliamentary election. He replied that Egypt's unregistered 
<br>voters were now excited about politics and enthusiastic to 
<br>register to vote in future elections, when the registration 
<br>period opens in late 2005. The PDAS asked if any opposition 
<br>party would get the five percent of the parliamentary seats 
<br>need to field a future presidential candidate. Gamal 
<br>shrugged and replied that this would depend on the opposition 
<br>parties' organization and discipline. Might the GOE revise 
<br>Article 76 again, the PDAS asked, if an opposition party 
<br>failed to get the required five percent? Gamal replied that 
<br>talk of additional modification of Article 76 was premature: 
<br>"the ink is not yet dry," he said. 
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) He also argued that the special candidacy rules in 
<br>2005, to encourage multiple presidential candidates, could 
<br>not be extended in future elections. The somewhat less 
<br>restrictive rules for 2005 had been necessary, he said, as an 
<br>incentive to the parties to "get their acts together." In 
<br>the long term, however, encouragement of fringe candidates 
<br>who do not have significant parliamentary representation 
<br>would be a recipe for "chaos." 
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) The PDAS sought Gamal's views on rumors that the 
<br>President plans to appoint a vice president. Gamal professed 
<br>ignorance on the subject. Should the President appoint a VP, 
<br>the PDAS asked. Gamal paused for a moment then said some 
<br>people argue the President should name a Vice President, 
<br>while others say that the new amendment to the Constitution 
<br>makes a vice president unnecessary. Gamal said, "I listen to 
<br>both arguments." 
<br>
<br>-------------- 
<br>A Man in Full? 
<br>-------------- 
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) At Gamal's invitation, the PDAS and DAS later 
<br>attended the gala reception on September 29 hosted by the NDP 
<br>for the diplomatic corps on the occasion of the party's 
<br>annual conference. Members of the diplomatic corps, 
<br>including the Iranian Ambassador, gathered around Gamal vying 
<br>for his attention and the opportunity to shake his hand. 
<br>Party old-guard figures Kemal al-Shazli and Safwat Sherif 
<br>stood together off to the side while Gamal was clearly the 
<br>center of the show. Minister of Tourism, Ahmed Maghrabi, 
<br>told the PDAS that members of the new guard received loud and 
<br>prolonged applause whenever they took the podium at the party 
<br>congress. The reception for old guard figures, by contrast, 
<br>was muted and polite. Judging from this, Maghrabi said, "I 
<br>don,t think the old guard will be with us much longer." 
<br>
<br>¶16. (U) PDAS Cheney cleared this message.
