<br>INR/CCS, Reason: 1.4 (c, d). 
<br> 
<br>SUMMARY AND TABLE OF CONTENTS 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (S/NF) This telegram replaces Ref A as the 
<br>Department's comprehensive guidance on handling 
<br>foreign national walk-ins, defectors, and asylum 
<br>seekers - all of whom are generally referred to in 
<br>this telegram as "walk-ins."  This telegram was 
<br>coordinated with interagency partners, including 
<br>CIA, DHS, DIA, and the FBI.  It explains the 
<br>procedures for receiving walk-ins; determining 
<br>whether they are of intelligence value and whether 
<br>defector, temporary refuge, protection, 
<br>resettlement, parole, or other status is 
<br>appropriate; and coordinating an appropriate 
<br>response.  A link to this telegram will be included 
<br>in the Chief of Mission (COM) Guide on ClassNet 
<br>(http://diplomaps.state.sgov.gov/com).  (For 
<br>guidance on handling U.S. citizens requesting 
<br>emergency protection ("temporary refuge") at posts, 
<br>see Ref B.) 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (S/NF) COMs should ensure that all post 
<br>personnel are properly prepared to handle walk-ins. 
<br>Post management, RSO, and GRPO have the most 
<br>responsibility for ensuring proper handling of 
<br>walk-ins, but other officers may play critical 
<br>roles. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (S/NF) Correct handling of walk-ins is 
<br>important for three principal reasons.  Walk-ins 
<br>(1) may be sources of invaluable intelligence; (2) 
<br>pose numerous security challenges; and (3) may need 
<br>protection.  Improper handling of walk-ins can put 
<br>them and post personnel at risk and result in the 
<br>loss of important intelligence.  Thus, post's 
<br>procedures must be clear, well-understood, and 
<br>workable at any hour, day or night. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (U) Questions or comments regarding the 
<br>guidance in this telegram should normally be 
<br>directed by telegram to INR/CCS, which will 
<br>coordinate a Department response.  If additional 
<br>guidance is required in an emergency walk-in 
<br>situation, however, post should contact the 
<br>Department's Operations Center (202-647-1512), 
<br>which will alert the appropriate Department 
<br>personnel. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (U) This telegram contains the following 
<br>sections: 
<br> 
<br>¶A. - Storage and dissemination of this telegram 
<br>(paragraph 6) 
<br>¶B. - Post preparation for handling walk-ins

<br> 
<br>END SUMMARY. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Section A.  STORAGE AND DISSEMINATION OF THIS 
<br>TELEGRAM 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (U) Posts should retain this telegram in the 
<br>RSO's files and in a location accessible to duty 
<br>officers, replacing and destroying Ref A and any 
<br>other prior versions.  RSOs should ensure that all 
<br>officers have read this telegram and know where it 
<br>is retained. 
<br> 
<br>Section B.  POST PREPARATION FOR HANDLING WALK-INS 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (S/NF) Each post's Counterintelligence Working 
<br>Group (CIWG) should meet upon receipt of this 
<br>telegram to review post's procedures for dealing 
<br>with walk-ins.  The CIWG should ensure that post's 
<br>procedures are consistent with the guidance in this 
<br>telegram and local security concerns, include 
<br>appropriate defensive security measures, and allow 
<br>screened walk-ins to meet securely with appropriate 
<br>post officials. 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (S/NF) Post's walk-ins procedures should 
<br>include (1) special procedures for the reception of 
<br>embassy (including consular section) walk-ins of 
<br>possible intelligence value; (2) procedures for 
<br>constituent posts, if any; and (3) procedures for 
<br>approaches at residences, in vehicles, on the 
<br>street, via telephone, and through both electronic 
<br>and hand-delivered mail.  Heightened security at 
<br>USG installations increases the possibility of 
<br>approaches to USG officials outside USG facilities. 
<br>Because of the inherent risks, however, post 
<br>procedures should permit arranging substantive 
<br>meetings outside post only in exceptional 
<br>circumstances and only after approval of the COM 
<br>based on the recommendations of the RSO and GRPO. 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (S/NF) Post's procedures must allow for 
<br>appropriately balancing the following 
<br>considerations which may come into play in walk-in 
<br>cases: 
<br> 
<br>(a) post security; 
<br>(b) the safety of the individual; 
<br>(c) the intelligence value and bona fides of the 
<br>individual; 
<br>(d) whether the individual requires protection and, 
<br>if so, whether appropriate protection is available 
<br>from international organizations or host-country 
<br>sources; 
<br>(e) whether the individual should be resettled 
<br>outside the host-country and, if so, whether 
<br>resettlement in another country or the United 
<br>States is possible; 
<br>(f) the time available for resolution of the case; 
<br>and 
<br>(g) the need to safeguard the confidentiality of 
<br>any information that may have a bearing on a future 
<br>consular-related activity or possible resettlement 
<br>request. 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (S/NF) Post's procedures must be cleared by 
<br>the RSO and coordinated with the GRPO and, at posts 
<br>with an FBI Legal Attache (LEGATT), with the 
<br>LEGATT.  (All three should be on post's CIWG.) 
<br>Post's RSO should update post's walk-in plan with 
<br>the GRPO and LEGATT, if any, on a semi-annual basis 
<br>or as needed. 
<br> 
<br>¶11.  (S/NF) RSOs should ensure that all relevant 
<br>potential participants in handling walk-ins are 
<br>appropriately briefed and trained.  Non-cleared 
<br>personnel can be told that a USG official will 
<br>interview walk-ins, because that fact is not 
<br>classified.  The fact that a walk-in may be 
<br>referred to other post officials for a decision on 
<br>further actions is classified and may not be shared 
<br>with non-cleared personnel.  All briefings should 
<br>emphasize the importance of ensuring that the walk- 
<br>in is fully screened, but should also convey that 
<br>legitimate walk-ins may exhibit nervous or anxious 
<br>behavior, particularly because access controls and 
<br>host nation security forces around many of our 
<br>diplomatic posts make it difficult for walk-ins to 
<br>approach our facilities discreetly.  All briefings 
<br>should also stress the importance of not drawing 
<br>attention to the walk-in or alerting host nation 
<br>security personnel. 
<br> 
<br>¶12.  (S/NF) RSO briefings should include (1) 
<br>briefing those who may have first contact with a 
<br>walk-in - including non-USG local guards and 
<br>receptionists - on the procedures to follow at 
<br>first contact; (2) providing additional briefings 
<br>to MSGs, other USG security personnel, and USG duty 
<br>officers on a semi-annual basis or as needed on 
<br>more sensitive aspects of the program; (3) briefing 
<br>consular officers on handling walk-ins who approach 
<br>through a consular service window; and (4) briefing 
<br>all arriving cleared USG personnel on the 
<br>procedures for approaches that occur off post 
<br>premises (as part of the arrival briefing). 
<br> 
<br>¶13.  (S/NF) To ensure that walk-ins can communicate 
<br>their wishes clearly, post may wish to prepare 
<br>language cards that can be shown at first contact 
<br>to a walk-in who does not speak English, giving 
<br>options from which the walk-in can select.  One 
<br>option should be "I wish to speak with an American 
<br>official."  Other options should be plausible 
<br>alternatives, such as "I wish to obtain information 
<br>about travel requirements."  In addition to the 
<br>local language, post should consider having such 
<br>cards available in priority interest languages such 
<br>as Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Farsi, Mandarin, and 
<br>Korean, as appropriate in light of the local 
<br>environment. 
<br> 
<br>¶14.  (S/NF) The RSO should incorporate post's 
<br>procedures into the MSG and local guard orders as 
<br>necessary. 
<br> 
<br>¶15.  (S/NF) Posts should designate a room, 
<br>preferably outside the Public Access Control (PAC) 
<br>hard-line, for conducting the initial interview of 
<br>a walk-in. 
<br> 
<br>¶16.  (S/NF) Post should have an interview guide 
<br>that can be used during the initial interview, and 
<br>should maintain a current roster of cleared USG 
<br>personnel who can provide interpretation services 
<br>to assist the RSO and others in interviewing walk- 
<br>ins as required. 
<br> 
<br>¶17.  (S/NF) Post procedures should clearly identify 
<br>the officer who will do the initial interview of a 
<br>walk-in, and a backup for when that officer is 
<br>absent.  (These are normally the RSO and Assistant 
<br>RSO.)  These officials should have a prearranged 
<br>signal and appropriate contact numbers for 
<br>notifying GRPO of a walk-in of possible 
<br>intelligence value. 
<br> 
<br>¶18.  (S/NF) MSGs, local guards, and receptionists 
<br>should have a codeword or pre-arranged signal to 
<br>alert the RSO (or other designated officer) of a 
<br>person requesting to speak with a U.S. officer. 
<br> 
<br>¶19.  (U) Post should verify that current phone 
<br>numbers, addresses, and directions for host 
<br>government offices that handle refugee claims and 
<br>the local offices of the UNHCR and UNDP are 
<br>included in post's walk-in procedures and the duty 
<br>officer handbook.  This information should also be 
<br>readily available as a handout for walk-ins. 
<br> 
<br>¶20.  (U) Post procedures should contain current 
<br>information on the host government's legal 
<br>obligations towards persons claiming to be refugees 
<br>or to be in danger of being tortured.  These 
<br>obligations may arise from the host country's 
<br>domestic law and/or treaty obligations.  States 
<br>party to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status 
<br>of Refugees, its 1967 Protocol, and the 1969 
<br>African Union Convention Governing the Specific 
<br>Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa have agreed 
<br>not to expel or return refugees, as defined in 
<br>those instruments, from their territory under 
<br>certain circumstances.  States party to the 1987 
<br>Convention Against Torture and other Cruel, 
<br>Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment have 
<br>agreed not to expel or return an individual from 
<br>their territory to another country where there are 
<br>substantial grounds for believing that he/she would 
<br>be in danger of being subjected to torture. 
<br> 
<br>¶21.  (S/NF) RSO and GRPO should coordinate any 
<br>operational tests of walk-in procedures. 
<br> 
<br>¶22.  (S/NF) RSOs should review walk-in procedures 
<br>with constituent posts and ensure that they are 
<br>properly prepared to handle walk-ins.  This should 
<br>include ensuring that constituent post's procedures 
<br>are also incorporated into local guard orders as 
<br>necessary. 
<br> 
<br>¶23.  (S/NF) Posts without an RSO, GRPO, or 
<br>UNHCR/UNDP presence in-country should promptly 
<br>develop additional post-specific guidance to ensure 
<br>that the guidance in this telegram is adjusted to 
<br>fit their situation. 
<br> 
<br>Section C.  PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING WALK-IN 
<br>ARRIVALS 
<br> 
<br>¶24.  (S/NF) The MSG, local guard, receptionist, or 
<br>other employee or official who first makes contact 
<br>with the walk-in should ascertain whether the walk- 
<br>in wishes to talk with the USG official, using the 
<br>language cards as necessary.  If so, they should 
<br>use the pre-arranged signal to inform the USG 
<br>official designated to deal with walk-ins (normally 
<br>the RSO or Assistant RSO) as soon as possible. 
<br>Posts with MSGs may wish to instruct non-USG local 
<br>guards, receptionists, and others likely to be a 
<br>walk-in's first point of contact to refer a walk-in 
<br>who wishes to speak with a USG official to the MSG, 
<br>and then have the MSG involve the RSO. 
<br> 
<br>¶25.  (C) Post's first priority must be to determine 
<br>whether the individual is carrying a weapon, 
<br>device, or hazardous material that endangers post 
<br>personnel.  Walk-ins must be screened and searched 
<br>before being permitted within the security 
<br>perimeter.  If a walk-in possesses any object or 
<br>item that appears suspicious or potentially 
<br>hazardous, security personnel should deny access 
<br>even if the walk-in presents the item as evidence 
<br>of some intelligence he offers, e.g., red mercury 
<br>presented as proof of plutonium enrichment. 
<br>Security personnel are not required to prove that 
<br>an object, item, or material is hazardous to refuse 
<br>entry to the walk-in.  Only DS-supplied and/or DS- 
<br>approved instruments should be used to examine 
<br>suspect material.  Posts should follow established 
<br>DS and Department procedures for screening and 
<br>reporting suspect materials, e.g., white powder 
<br>incidents.  In the event post encounters material 
<br>or information relating to alleged radioactive 
<br>materials, please refer to Ref C for comprehensive 
<br>interagency approved guidance. 
<br> 
<br>¶26.  (C) The walk-in's identification and/or travel 
<br>documents should be copied as soon as the walk-in 
<br>is screened in, if at all possible.  Otherwise, the 
<br>papers should be copied before the end of the walk- 
<br>in's initial interview.  Identifying and keeping 
<br>records of walk-ins is important for security and 
<br>intelligence reasons; copying their identity 
<br>documents early is advisable because walk-ins may 
<br>get cold feet and leave if kept waiting for an 
<br>interview. 
<br> 
<br>¶27.  (S/NF) After the walk-in has been searched, 
<br>the RSO or designated alternate must interview the 
<br>walk-in, using post's interview guide.  The RSO 
<br>should attempt to establish the individual's bona 
<br>fides.  (Walk-ins may in fact be mentally disturbed 
<br>persons, intelligence vendors, fabricators, 
<br>provocateurs from hostile intelligence services, or 
<br>persons gathering information on behalf of 
<br>terrorist organizations.)  Once the subject's bona 
<br>fides are established to the RSO's satisfaction, 
<br>the RSO should establish what the walk-in wants, 
<br>whether the walk-in appears to be of possible 
<br>intelligence or counterintelligence interest, how 
<br>much time the walk-in has, and methods for future 
<br>contact, among other information.  The RSO must 
<br>also attempt to determine whether the individual is 
<br>in imminent danger, including (1) immediate 
<br>physical danger, (2) danger of involuntary 
<br>repatriation to a country where the individual's 
<br>life or freedom would be threatened for reasons of 
<br>race, religion, nationality, membership in a 
<br>particular social group, or political opinion, or 
<br>(3) danger of involuntary repatriation to a country 
<br>where it is more likely than not that the 
<br>individual will be subjected to torture.  Finally, 
<br>the RSO may have reason to interview the individual 
<br>for information regarding potential threats to USG 
<br>personnel and facilities.  (If such information is 
<br>obtained, the RSO generally should advise the 
<br>LEGATT and should consider flagging the individual 
<br>for the Rewards for Justice Program.) 
<br> 
<br>¶28.  (S/NF) Monitoring of foreign nationals in 
<br>walk-in rooms overseas is permitted only in 
<br>accordance with guidelines set forth in Ref D.  All 
<br>other recording or monitoring conducted by post 
<br>employees, including those in cover positions, must 
<br>be consistent with the Department Notice of January 
<br>24, 1977 ("the Vance Memorandum"), which states 
<br>that "No officer or employee of the State 
<br>Department . . . shall direct, arrange for, permit, 
<br>or undertake the monitoring or mechanical or 
<br>electronic recording of any conversation, including 
<br>any telephone conversation, without the express 
<br>consent of all persons involved in the 
<br>conversation," unless advance approval is granted 
<br>by the Secretary or the Deputy Secretary of State. 
<br>(Reproduced at Tab U, Special Agent's Legal 
<br>Authorities, available at 
<br>http://intranet.state.gov.) 
<br> 
<br>¶29.  (C) Post personnel should never leave a walk- 
<br>in unattended. If possible, two or more post 
<br>officials should work together during the interview 
<br>phase. 
<br> 
<br>¶30.  (S/NF) If the RSO finds the walk-in credible 
<br>and to be of possible foreign intelligence or 
<br>counterintelligence interest, the RSO should follow 
<br>post procedures to ensure transfer of the walk-in 
<br>to the GRPO as quickly as possible with minimal 
<br>exposure to other post personnel.  The GRPO will 
<br>determine further actions (interview, contact again 
<br>at a later date, etc.). 
<br> 
<br>¶31.  (C) Post must strictly limit disclosure of the 
<br>fact of any request for temporary refuge, departure 
<br>from the host country, asylum in the United States, 
<br>third-country visa assistance, issuance or refusal 
<br>of visas or permits to enter the United States, and 
<br>requests to resettle elsewhere.  Only USG personnel 
<br>with a need-to-know should be made aware of such 
<br>requests. 
<br> 
<br>¶32.  (C) Post should provide no comment in response 
<br>to press inquiries, unless otherwise instructed by 
<br>the Department. 
<br> 
<br>¶33.  (C) Post must consult with the Department 
<br>prior to responding to congressional inquiries on 
<br>specific walk-in cases. 
<br> 
<br>Section D.  REQUIREMENTS FOR REPORTING ON WALK-INS 
<br> 
<br>¶34.  (S/NF) If a walk-in is of intelligence 
<br>interest, the case will be handled by the 
<br>Intelligence Community (IC) once that interest is 
<br>established, and reporting on the case will occur 
<br>in IC channels.  Post must notify the Department of 
<br>all/all cases not handled within the IC and 
<br>involving the following, using the reporting 
<br>channels described in paragraphs 37-39 below except 
<br>where otherwise indicated: 
<br> 
<br>(a) A person who may have information on immediate 
<br>threats to USG personnel or facilities.  See 
<br>paragraph 35 below for reporting channel 
<br>instructions. 
<br>(b) A person who possesses information regarding 
<br>plans and intentions of governments and/or 
<br>organizations hostile to the United States. 
<br>(c) A person who may have information on weapons 
<br>proliferation, weapons of mass destruction, 
<br>counterterrorism, counternarcotics, or any 
<br>significant new intelligence or military-related 
<br>subjects. 
<br>(d) A foreign diplomat, foreign consular officer, 
<br>other foreign government official (including 
<br>members of the national police and the military), 
<br>or political party official, regardless of his/her 
<br>country of nationality. 
<br>(e) A person who appears threatened by involuntary 
<br>repatriation to a country where the person's life 
<br>or freedom would be threatened for reasons of race, 
<br>religion, nationality, membership in a particular 
<br>social group, or political opinion, or where it is 
<br>more likely than not that the person would be 
<br>tortured.  See paragraph 36 below for reporting 
<br>channel instructions. 
<br>(f) Persons seeking resettlement (including 
<br>"asylum") in the United States.  See Section E 
<br>(paragraphs 40-52) below and Ref E for additional 
<br>guidance on such cases. 
<br>(g) Persons granted temporary refuge.  See 
<br>paragraphs 50-52 for instructions on reporting such 
<br>cases. 
<br> 
<br>¶35.  (S/NF) Security threat information reportable 
<br>per paragraph 34(a) above should be reported via 
<br>TERREP or TERREP exclusive channel telegram (as 
<br>appropriate) as soon as possible.  Threat 
<br>information of an extremely urgent nature should be 
<br>provided to the RSO and other appropriate post 
<br>officials immediately and relayed to the DS Command 
<br>Center (DSCC) at (571) 345-3146 or via DSCC secure 
<br>line at (571) 345-7793. 
<br> 
<br>¶36.  (S/NF) Cases involving threats of involuntary 
<br>return as described in paragraph 34(e) above should 
<br>be brought to the Department's attention 
<br>immediately, by phone, email or cable slugged for 
<br>PRM/A, with U.S. Mission Geneva, attention Refugee 
<br>and Migration Affairs (RMA), as an info addressee. 
<br> 
<br>¶37.  (S/NF) Except as specified above for threat 
<br>and involuntary return cases, telegrams should be 
<br>sent through normal channels, be slugged for 
<br>INR/CCS, P, DS/CI, and the appropriate regional 
<br>bureau, and describe the time-sensitivity of the 
<br>case.  INR/CCS is the action office and will 
<br>distribute to other bureaus as appropriate.  In 
<br>extremely sensitive cases, post should send a Roger 
<br>Channel telegram to INR/CCS, which will ensure 
<br>appropriate, limited distribution. 
<br> 
<br>¶38.  (S/NF) If the case may require consideration 
<br>of U.S. resettlement options, posts may also wish 
<br>to slug PRM/A, DRL/MLGA, L/HRR, and CA/VO, and to 
<br>add DHS/USCIS WASHDC as an info addressee. 
<br> 
<br>¶39.  (S/NF) All telegrams should use the PINR and 
<br>ASEC tags.  CVIS and PREF tags also should be used 
<br>in potential resettlement cases.  All telegrams 
<br>referring to UNHCR should add U.S. Mission Geneva, 
<br>attention Refugee and Migration Affairs (RMA), as 
<br>an info addressee. 
<br> 
<br>Section E.  TEMPORARY REFUGE - CAUTIONS AND 
<br>GUIDANCE 
<br> 
<br>¶40.  (S/NF) Walk-ins sometimes request that they be 
<br>permitted to remain in an embassy or other USG 
<br>facility beyond closing hours.  The Department 
<br>considers this a request for temporary refuge, not 
<br>a request for asylum, and post officials should be 
<br>particularly careful not to equate the two.  In 
<br>U.S. immigration law, asylum is a status granted to 
<br>qualified refugees, and an application for "asylum" 
<br>can only be made in the United States.  A walk-in 
<br>may request "asylum" in an embassy based on the 
<br>erroneous belief that safe passage out of the host 
<br>country will be assured if the request is granted. 
<br>While a few mostly Latin American countries 
<br>recognize such a right of "diplomatic asylum," the 
<br>United States and most other countries do not 
<br>recognize that concept or accept that the granting 
<br>of refuge in an embassy is an authorized use of 
<br>diplomatic facilities.  A walk-in who requests 
<br>"asylum" may also in substance be requesting an 
<br>opportunity to resettle in the United States; 
<br>guidance on such requests is below under long-term 
<br>options. 
<br> 
<br>¶41.  (S/NF) Granting a walk-in temporary refuge in 
<br>an embassy or other USG facility may actually 
<br>increase the danger to an individual, particularly 
<br>in hostile countries and if the individual is a 
<br>host-country national.  The longer the person 
<br>remains, the more likely the host government will 
<br>become aware of the request for temporary refuge 
<br>and possibly take retaliatory action.  In hostile 
<br>countries, the United States generally is unable 
<br>either to assure a walk-in's safe conduct out of 
<br>the country or continued safety in the country once 
<br>they leave post premises.  Thus granting temporary 
<br>refuge may lead to a protracted stalemate, with the 
<br>walk-in effectively residing in post premises. 
<br>"Residence within a post" of persons hostile to the 
<br>host government could be a continuing source of 
<br>controversy and lead to serious adverse effects on 
<br>U.S. interests and unexpected financial 
<br>implications for the post. 
<br> 
<br>¶42.  (U) In light of these factors, all foreign 
<br>national walk-ins seeking refuge in a USG facility 
<br>should be informed that post cannot ensure (a) 
<br>their safe conduct out of the host country; (b) 
<br>their future safety within the host country; or (c) 
<br>their entry into the United States.  They should 
<br>also be informed that they may actually endanger 
<br>their own welfare or interests by remaining at 
<br>post. 
<br> 
<br>¶43.  (S/NF) Temporary refuge may never be granted 
<br>to foreign nationals who simply wish to immigrate 
<br>to the United States or evade local criminal law; 
<br>if granting refuge would put post security in 
<br>jeopardy; or if the Department instructs post not 
<br>to do so. 
<br> 
<br>¶44.  (S/NF) Post should use appropriate measures to 
<br>remove a person seeking refuge from the premises 
<br>when temporary refuge is not warranted. 
<br> 
<br>¶45.  (S/NF) Only the COM or Principal Officer, or a 
<br>person designated to act on their behalf in their 
<br>absence, may grant a request for temporary refuge. 
<br> 
<br>¶46.  (S/NF) Temporary refuge may be granted only if 
<br>there is compelling evidence that the walk-in is in 
<br>imminent physical danger for any reason, or in 
<br>imminent danger of persecution for reasons of race, 
<br>religion, nationality, membership in a particular 
<br>social group, or political opinion. 
<br> 
<br>¶47.  (S/NF) Within the kinds of cases described in 
<br>paragraph 46, post should grant temporary refuge in 
<br>those rare situations in which an individual faces 
<br>not just imminent physical danger, but immediate 
<br>and exceptionally grave physical danger, i.e., 
<br>possible death or serious bodily injury, either in 
<br>the host country or in another country to which the 
<br>individual will be summarily returned by host- 
<br>country authorities. 
<br> 
<br>¶48.  (S/NF) Also within the kinds of cases 
<br>described in paragraph 46, post may at its 
<br>discretion grant temporary refuge if the physical 
<br>danger or the danger of involuntary repatriation as 
<br>defined above is less serious but appears imminent. 
<br>In determining if granting temporary refuge is 
<br>appropriate in such instances, post should consider 
<br>the following questions: 
<br> 
<br>(a) How serious and immediate is the threat to the 
<br>walk-in? 
<br>(b) Will the threat to the individual increase or 
<br>decrease if the walk-in is allowed to remain at 
<br>post? 
<br>(c) Can the individual leave or be required to 
<br>leave post without being noticed? 
<br>(d) If detection by host government authorities is 
<br>inevitable and the alleged threat is from the host 
<br>government, can the walk-in's presence and 
<br>subsequent departure be explained in a manner that 
<br>will not further endanger the individual? 
<br>(e) What are the likely consequences of allowing 
<br>the individual to temporarily remain at the post 
<br>with regards to the individual, other persons in 
<br>the host country, the security of the post, and the 
<br>safety of U.S. Government personnel? 
<br>(f) Is the individual of intelligence value to the 
<br>United States? 
<br>(g) Is the person facing immediate and 
<br>exceptionally grave physical danger on account of 
<br>peaceful political, religious, or humanitarian 
<br>activities consistent with U.S. values and 
<br>policies? 
<br> 
<br>¶49.  (C/NF) Temporary refuge generally should not 
<br>be granted at residential diplomatic or consular 
<br>premises.  The inviolability of diplomatic 
<br>residences (except the COM's) is linked to the 
<br>diplomat's residency and may be lost if the host 
<br>government declares persona non grata (PNG) the 
<br>diplomat whose residence is involved. Consular 
<br>residences do not enjoy inviolability (unless it is 
<br>provided by special agreement). As a practical 
<br>matter all residences, whether diplomatic or 
<br>consular, are generally less secure than the 
<br>embassy or consulate. 
<br> 
<br>¶50.  (C) If temporary refuge is granted, post 
<br>should notify the Department in an appropriately 
<br>classified "NIACT Immediate" precedence telegram 
<br>and should notify other relevant overseas posts by 
<br>immediate precedence telegram.  Telegrams to the 
<br>Department should be slugged for INR/CCS, P, PRM/A, 
<br>L/HRR, L/DL, DSCC, DRL/MLGA, CA/VO, and the 
<br>appropriate regional bureau.  DHS/USCIS WASHDC 
<br>should be a direct telegraphic info addressee. 
<br>Post also should notify the Department by telegram 
<br>if temporary refuge is requested but denied, unless 
<br>the case is clearly without merit, e.g., appeals by 
<br>a drunken or deranged person. 
<br> 
<br>¶51.  (S/NF) If the host government (or the 
<br>government of the alien's nationality, if the 
<br>individual is a third-country national) requests an 
<br>interview with a walk-in who is granted temporary 
<br>refuge, post should notify the Department and await 
<br>guidance.  Post should not/not comply with such 
<br>interview requests unless explicitly authorized to 
<br>do so by the Department. 
<br> 
<br>¶52.  (SBU) If granted, temporary refuge should be 
<br>terminated as soon as circumstances permit (e.g., 
<br>when the period of active danger ends), but only 
<br>with Department authorization.  Post management 
<br>should inform the Department (to the same 
<br>addressees listed in paragraph 50) when temporary 
<br>refuge is terminated.  A person who has been 
<br>granted temporary refuge may, of course, leave 
<br>voluntarily whenever he/she wishes.  Post 
<br>management should reasonably ensure that the 
<br>decision to leave is voluntary. 
<br> 
<br>Section F.  LONG-TERM OPTIONS 
<br> 
<br>¶53.  (U) Walk-ins often wish to resettle in the 
<br>United States, but this may not be appropriate or 
<br>possible.  The United States encourages local or 
<br>regional resettlement of refugees and international 
<br>resettlement burden-sharing among many governments. 
<br> 
<br>¶54.  (C/NF) In routine cases involving walk-ins 
<br>from third countries who may be refugees, the walk- 
<br>in should be referred to the host government for 
<br>adjudication of his or her status as long as the 
<br>host country has satisfactory asylum or refugee- 
<br>processing procedures.  In most cases, potential 
<br>refugees should also be referred to the local 
<br>office of the UNHCR, especially if local 
<br>refugee/asylum procedures are not available.  UNHCR 
<br>is mandated to provide protection for refugees and 
<br>has primary international responsibility for 
<br>seeking durable solutions for refugees, including 
<br>possible opportunities for third-country 
<br>resettlement.  This mandate extends to UNHCR even 
<br>in countries that are not party to any of the 
<br>treaties just mentioned.  Where there is no UNHCR 
<br>office, UNHCR's responsibilities are normally 
<br>handled by the local UNDP office.  Beware, however, 
<br>that in some countries UNHCR (or UNDP) may be 
<br>placed in an awkward position if it is notified of 
<br>a case and there is a need to conceal the case from 
<br>the host government.  If this possibility exists, 
<br>post should approach UNHCR or UNDP discreetly. 
<br> 
<br>¶55.  (C/NF) If it appears that entry into the 
<br>United States is the appropriate long-term solution 
<br>to a walk-in's situation, the walk-in should not be 
<br>issued a non-immigrant visa except in unusual 
<br>circumstances after consultation with the 
<br>Department.  Non-immigrant admission will generally 
<br>not be appropriate because the circumstances that 
<br>lead an individual to become a walk-in normally 
<br>lead also to ineligibility under section 214(b) of 
<br>the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) as an 
<br>intending immigrant.  Admission to the United 
<br>States therefore normally should be as a refugee or 
<br>parolee.  In some circumstances an immigrant visa 
<br>may also be available. 
<br> 
<br>REFUGEE ADMISSION 
<br> 
<br>¶56.  (U) A person outside the United States may be 
<br>granted refugee admission if he or she qualifies as 
<br>a "refugee" as defined in U.S. law and meets other 
<br>applicable requirements.  DHS has sole 
<br>responsibility for adjudicating applications for 
<br>refugee admission outside the United States. 
<br>DHS/USCIS officers determine whether or not an 
<br>individual is a refugee on a case-by-case basis 
<br>after a personal interview.  To qualify, a person 
<br>must normally be outside his country.  Given 
<br>adequate justification, however, DHS may adjudicate 
<br>an "in country" refugee application when requested 
<br>by a U.S. Ambassador with the concurrence of PRM/A 
<br>and DHS/USCIS in Washington.  See Ref F, entitled 
<br>"How a post can refer cases to the U.S. refugee 
<br>admissions program", and Ref G, entitled "Worldwide 
<br>processing priority system for FY 2010", for more 
<br>information. 
<br> 
<br>¶57.  (U) The U.S. definition of "refugee" 
<br>encompasses a person who, under the 1951 Convention 
<br>relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 
<br>Protocol, is outside his or her country of 
<br>nationality (or, if he or she has no nationality, 
<br>the country of last habitual residence) and has 
<br>experienced past persecution or has a well-founded 
<br>fear of persecution in that country on account of 
<br>race, religion, nationality, membership in a 
<br>particular social group, or political opinion. 
<br>U.S. law deems the following persons to have been 
<br>persecuted on account of political opinion: a 
<br>person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or 
<br>to undergo involuntary sterilization, or who has 
<br>been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo 
<br>such a procedure, or for other resistance to a 
<br>coercive population control program; a person who 
<br>has a well-founded fear that he or she will be 
<br>forced to undergo such a procedure or be persecuted 
<br>for such failure, refusal, or resistance. 
<br> 
<br>¶58.  (U) Persons admitted to the United States as 
<br>refugees are eligible for initial reception and 
<br>placement assistance from non-government 
<br>organizations (NGOs) funded under cooperative 
<br>agreements with PRM and for other publicly funded 
<br>benefits. 
<br> 
<br>¶59.  (U) If the host government cannot or will not 
<br>protect the individual from involuntary 
<br>repatriation and UNHCR is unable to intervene, and 
<br>post believes that the person may qualify as a 
<br>refugee, post should contact PRM/A for guidance on 
<br>how to proceed. 
<br> 
<br>PAROLE 
<br> 
<br>¶60.  (S/NF) Foreign nationals may also travel to 
<br>the United States pursuant to the Secretary of 
<br>Homeland Security's parole authority under Section 
<br>212(d)(5) of the INA.  Parole may be granted based 
<br>on humanitarian or significant public benefit 
<br>grounds.  Authority over humanitarian parole 
<br>requests rests with DHS/USCIS/RAIO/HAB.  Authority 
<br>over Significant Public Benefit Parole (SPBP) rests 
<br>with DHS/ICE.  DHS/ICE/OIA-LEPB has developed 
<br>guidelines in consultation with the Department for 
<br>the processing of SPBP cases.  Guidelines for both 
<br>types of parole are contained in Ref H. 
<br> 
<br>¶61.  (S/NF) Use of parole for a walk-in may be 
<br>warranted in extraordinary cases, such as when no 
<br>other resolution appears feasible and a walk-in is 
<br>of special interest to the United States, when a 
<br>walk-in is in immediate danger, or when the case is 
<br>politically sensitive.  If post wishes to pursue 
<br>parole for a walk-in, it must submit a request by 
<br>telegram, slugged for INR/CCS, CA/VO/F/P, DRL/MLGA, 
<br>P, and the appropriate regional bureau.  An info 
<br>copy should go to the appropriate DHS bureau. The 
<br>telegram must provide justification for the 
<br>request; include a certification by the COM or the 
<br>Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM) that the information 
<br>provided is complete and accurate; and identify all 
<br>interested agencies at post that were involved in 
<br>reviewing and endorsing the request.  A "CLASS" 
<br>name check must be completed, and all required 
<br>Security Advisory Opinion requests (SAOs) must be 
<br>submitted.  The results of the "CLASS" name check 
<br>should be indicated in the cable. 
<br> 
<br>¶62.  (U) All financial arrangements for parolees 
<br>must be made in advance.  Post should not make any 
<br>guarantees of such assistance, but should maintain 
<br>a list of possible local sponsors that might be 
<br>willing to assist (e.g., church groups or social 
<br>service agencies in the United States), to contact 
<br>in urgent situations if the parolee first agrees 
<br>and signs a statement authorizing disclosure of 
<br>his/her identity and situation to persons outside 
<br>the U.S. Government.  In some cases the Department 
<br>may also be able to help by contacting private 
<br>organizations in the United States to assist 
<br>parolees upon arrival. 
<br> 
<br>DEFECTORS 
<br> 
<br>¶63.  (S/NF) For the purpose of this telegram, the 
<br>term "defector" refers to a person of any 
<br>nationality (usually from a country whose interests 
<br>are hostile or inimical to those of the United 
<br>States) who has escaped from the control of their 
<br>home country and is of special interest to the U.S. 
<br>Government.  Defector cases generally are handled 
<br>under parole procedures.  The GRPO will work out 
<br>these arrangements with DHS/ICE and/or post's 
<br>consular section once Washington's approval is 
<br>obtained.  The LEGATT should be notified of 
<br>defector status as soon as practicable. 
<br> 
<br>Section G.  TRAVEL ASSISTANCE 
<br> 
<br>¶64.  (S/NF) If the appropriate agencies decide that 
<br>a walk-in should be allowed to travel to the United 
<br>States (in any of the capacities described above), 
<br>transportation out of the host country and to the 
<br>United States must be arranged.  Transportation out 
<br>of friendly countries should not pose a problem. 
<br>Post should take appropriate steps, in coordination 
<br>with the host government, to ensure that the 
<br>individual is permitted to travel and protected 
<br>from possible adverse actions (e.g., by their 
<br>country of nationality).  If the individual lacks 
<br>means to pay for transportation, post should 
<br>consult with the Department regarding options. 
<br>Approved refugees are eligible for a transportation 
<br>loan administered by the International Organization 
<br>for Migration (IOM) (the recipient will be 
<br>responsible for eventual repayment).  In 
<br>exceptional circumstances, USG-funded 
<br>transportation assistance for parolees may also be 
<br>possible through IOM.  Requests for such assistance 
<br>should be sent to the Department (specifically 
<br>PRM/A) for consideration. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶65.  (S/NF) In unfriendly countries, transportation 
<br>out of the country may prove impossible or 
<br>impractical.  In such cases, the individual should 
<br>be informed that if he/she makes their way to a 
<br>more friendly country, the United States will 
<br>consider them for admission.  To the extent 
<br>possible without compromising the confidentiality 
<br>of the individual's request, post should monitor 
<br>the situation and ensure that, if the individual 
<br>leaves the country, he/she is met by USG or UNHCR 
<br>officials at the first possible transit point. 
<br> 
<br>¶66.  (U) Minimize considered.
