<br>SUBJECT: NAJAF CLERICAL LEADERS FEAR IRANIAN IDEOLOGICAL 
<br>DOMINANCE 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Robert S. Ford for reasons 
<br>1.4 (b) and (d) 
<br> 
<br> ¶1.  (S) SUMMARY.  Three well-placed contacts in the Shia 
<br>holy city of Najaf told us December 27 that Iranian influence 
<br>there is strong and that Ayatollah Muhammad Said al-Hakim, 
<br>whose family has ties to Iran, likely will succeed the aging 
<br>Ayatollah Sistani.  They each opined al-Hakim could begin 
<br>changing the Najaf clerical establishment's long-time 
<br>opposition to the concept of clerical rule (velayat-e faqih). 
<br>One contact stated that the Najaf clerics have secured 
<br>permission from the Iraqi government to start refusing to 
<br>extend student visas for Iranians studying in Najaf in order 
<br>to limit Iranian influence.  Like many clerics here, these 
<br>contacts were keenly political and they obviously dislike and 
<br>fear the ISCI political party.  They asked the U.S. to do 
<br>more in Najaf to help limit the Islamic Supreme Council of 
<br>Iraq (ISCI) and Iran but xxxxxxxxxxxxx was insistent this be done indirectly and 
<br>with extreme caution.  END SUMMARY. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br>Iran, ISCI Spreading Velayat-e Faqih in Najaf 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (S) PMIN and Poloffs on December 27, 2008 discussed with 
<br>contacts close to the Najaf hawza (seminary), Iranian 
<br>influence in Najaf and hopes for U.S. assistance in combating 
<br>those exposing velayat-e faqih (clerical rule).  XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (S) XXXXXXXXXXXX decried the Iranian government's attempt to 
<br>directly and indirectly spread its influence in Najaf. 
<br>During the debate in the Iraqi parliament about the U.S.-Iraq 
<br>Security Agreement, XXXXXXXXXXXX said the Iranian Foreign Ministry 
<br>and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp Qods Force commander 
<br>Qasem Soleimani sent separate envoys to convince the 
<br>marja'iya to speak against the agreement.  XXXXXXXXXXXX claimed 
<br>that the marja'iya responded that it would be inappropriate 
<br>for them to comment on a security/political issue as a way of 
<br>dodging Iranian pressure.  XXXXXXXXXXXX also said Iran is giving 
<br>money to Iranian students in the hawza, primarily through 
<br>Supreme Leader Khamenei's office located in Najaf.  Iran 
<br>generally disperses small amounts -- money for furniture or 
<br>books, for example -- but recently gave a large sum to help a 
<br>hawza student with his medical treatment, XXXXXXXXXXXX claimed. 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX said that through financing Shahid 
<br>al-Mihrab (Martyrs of the Pulpit) -- the Islamic Supreme 
<br>Council of Iraq's (ISCI) social and educational organization 
<br>-- Iran aims to spread the popularity of velayat-e faqih. 
<br>(Note.  Shahid al-Mihrab is led by Ammar al-Hakim, ISCI's 
<br>heir apparent.  It is also the name ISCI is using nationwide 
<br>for its provincial election coalition.  End note.) XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>said Shahid al-Mihrab must be receiving Iranian funding to be 
<br>able to finance its wide network of offices in Iraq and 
<br>abroad.  (Comment:  While driving through Najaf, PMIN noticed 
<br>the construction of a large Shahid al-Mihrab complex at the 
<br>1920 Revolution Square along the city's main East-West 
<br>boulevard on property owned in 2003 by the now ISCI-dominated 
<br>provincial government.) 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br>"Moderates" Unable to Compete With Iranian Money 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (S)  XXXXXXXXXXXX said in response to alleged infiltration by 
<br>Iranian intelligence, the hawza secured permission from the 
<br>
<br>Iraqi government to stand up a committee to review residence 
<br>permits of non-Iraqi students at Najaf's religious schools. 
<br>  They have, he stated, allowed only the 
<br>few Iranian students who were present before the U.S. 
<br>invasion to continue their studies in Najaf.  Other Iranian 
<br>students are not receiving renewals on their student 
<br>residence permits and are being asked to leave Najaf when 
<br>their permits expire. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (S)  XXXXXXXXXXXX did not make a particular pitch on 
<br>politics aside from warning about Iranian influence.  By 
<br>contrast, XXXXXXXXXXXxx -- who also favor the 
<br>"quietist" clerical tradition of Sistani and Fayad -- were 
<br>pessimistic about the chances of "moderates" in the upcoming 
<br>elections because ISCI and Da'wa have been able to disperse 
<br>government jobs and contracts to boost their support.  (Note. 
<br> XXXXXXXXXXXxx is a parliamentarian from former Prime Minister Ayad 
<br>Allawi's party and Kalantar, given the alternatives, probably 
<br>also supports Allawi.  End note.) 
<br> 
<br>BAGHDAD 00000011  002 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (S) XXXXXXXXXXXxx joked about ISCI's campaign slogan "With you, 
<br>with you," by rhetorically asking "with who? Iran?"  When 
<br>asked about ISCI's history in Najaf, XXXXXXXXXXXxx pointedly said 
<br>ISCI had zero support prior to 2003 but were able to use its 
<br>Iranian-origin militia, the Badr Corps (now Badr 
<br>Organization), to gain power.  Despite switching its 
<br>religious source of emulation to Sistani, XXXXXXXXXXXXX claimed 
<br>his Badr Organization contacts still refer to the Iranian 
<br>Supreme Leader as "Sayyid al-Wali" (the Master). 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br>Fears of Grand Ayatollah Hakim Succeeding Sistani 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (S) Our three hawza contacts fear that Iran's push in 
<br>Najaf coupled with ISCI's political dominance in the province 
<br>are increasing the likelihood that Grand Ayatollah Muhammad 
<br>Said al-Hakim will succeed Sistani as Iraq's lead cleric. 
<br>Hakim -- a nephew to ISCI chairman Abd al-Aziz al-Hakim -- 
<br>favors Iranian velayat-e faqih, all three contacts said. 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXXX claimed it was telling that Hakim last year told his 
<br>followers to celebrate the festival marking the end of 
<br>Ramadan (Eid al-Fitr) on the day announced by Iran's 
<br>Khamenei, not Sistani.  XXXXXXXXXXXX was certain Hakim was now the 
<br>probable replacement.  Rubai highlighted that fellow Najaf 
<br>Ayatollah Bashir al-Najafi al-Pakistani has begun speaking in 
<br>favor of Hakim, something he was not doing only a couple of 
<br>years ago. XXXXXXXXXXXX  each claimed that al-Hakim 
<br>and Sistani each give out relatively generous gifts of money 
<br>to needy students and professors -- this is how one helps 
<br>build influence, they observed.  By contrast, al-Najafi and 
<br>Fayad have few resources for such gifts, they noted. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br>Seeking U.S. Support, But Carefully Done 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (S)XXXXXXXXXXXX  bluntly told PMIN the U.S. should, with a 
<br>hidden hand, fund moderate hawza groups to counter ISCI and 
<br>Iran.  However, XXXXXXXXXXXX said the United States regularly 
<br>irritates the marja'iya by, for example, clumsily -- if only 
<br>briefly -- detaining important clerical figures.  Perceived 
<br>American protection of the Mojahedin-e Khalq (MEK) also 
<br>raises questions about American judgment and intent, he 
<br>claimed.  (He didn't argue when PMIN reviewed our policy on 
<br>MEK but he said our position was not at all clear in Najaf.) 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX added that U.S. officials releasing to the media the 
<br>contents of private discussions between the Coalition 
<br>Provisional Authority and top Najaf clerics had led the 
<br>clerics to decide not to speak to the U.S. directly.  XXXXXXXXXXXxx
<br>advised that the U.S. should not associate itself with ISCI 
<br>cleric Jalal ad-Din al-Saghir because he is hostile to the 
<br>Najaf hawza.  When asked how "moderate" groups planned to 
<br>compete in the provincial and national elections in 2009, 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXxx clearly were defeatist and lacked a 
<br>practical vision.  XXXXXXXXXXXxx fatalistically repeated that 
<br>"there must be a (political) explosion" before Iraq rids 
<br>itself of the religious parties. 
<br> 
<br>-------- 
<br>Comment 
<br>-------- 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (S) Our meetings with XXXXXXXXXXXxx 
<br>reflect a broad trend in Iraq: the disenchantment and 
<br>disorganization of those Shia leaders who feel locked out of 
<br>the political process and who feel ISCI and Da'wa have used 
<br>their positions in government to write rules favorable to 
<br>themselves.  Many Shia still believe ISCI is controlled by 
<br>the Iranian government and that the Badr Organization wields 
<br>power covertly in Iraq.  These Shia dismiss evidence that 
<br>ISCI is becoming increasingly responsive to its Iraqi 
<br>QISCI is becoming increasingly responsive to its Iraqi 
<br>constituents and over the past few years have explicitly 
<br>acted against Iranian interest -- for example, by supporting 
<br>the U.S.-Iraq Security Agreement. 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (S) Comment continued.  The looming passing of Grand 
<br>Ayatollah Sistani makes Najaf pivotal for Iraq's ideological 
<br>future.  XXXXXXXXXXXxx is a long-time contact of ours and, XXXXXXXXXXXXX is well-placed to give us insights 
<br>into the top clerics' thinking.  He was extremely nervous 
<br>about being seen with PMIN and other American diplomats, 
<br>insisting on doing the meeting in XXXXXXXXXXxx not Najaf.  His 
<br>skittishness reminds of how cautious Sistani and the other 
<br>ayatollahs are about being seen to meet with or collaborate 
<br>with the Americans.  XXXXXXXXXXXxx was adamant that we should help 
<br>contain Iranian influence in Najaf but that it had to be done 
<br>indirectly by helping Iraqi organizations who themselves want 
<br>to limit Iranian influence.  Overaggressive or direct U.S. 
<br>involvement in Najaf's religious scene would, according to 
<br> 
<br>BAGHDAD 00000011  003 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>his analysis, backfire, undercutting those pro-American 
<br>Iraqis walking a fine between religious purity and earthly 
<br>power that could be derived from U.S. support.  If XXXXXXXXXXXxx 
<br>analysis is correct, Iraqis (and to a lesser extent Iranians) 
<br>will always be better placed than the U.S. to understand and 
<br>work within the nuances of Najaf's religious society.  END 
<br>COMMENT.
