<br>SUBJECT: AHMED WALI KARZAI AND GOVERNOR WEESA ON GOVERNANCE 
<br>IN KANDAHAR 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Interagency Provincial Affairs Deputy Coordinator Hoyt Y 
<br>ee for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: in a lengthy and cordial introductory meeting 
<br>with Kandahar Provincial Council Chief Ahmed Wali Karzai 
<br>(AWK) and Governor Tooryalai Weesa, Senior Civilian 
<br>Representative (SCR) for the South Frank Ruggiero underscored 
<br>the need for improved governance in Kandahar, and highlighted 
<br>the importance of naming credible provincial governors and 
<br>district officials before the inauguration to send a positive 
<br>signal on good governance to the Afghan people and the 
<br>international community. Both AWK and Weesa acknowledged the 
<br>weakness of the government in Kandahar, and outlined their 
<br>proposals for local solutions, including the empowerment of 
<br>shuras of district elders for local dispute resolution rather 
<br>than the courts. AWK also emphasized large-scale 
<br>infrastructure projects rather than smaller cash-for-work 
<br>program, and his desire to see private security companies in 
<br>the province under one licensee. AWK discounted the role of 
<br>elections and their importance to Afghans. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>AWK Nervous but Eager to Share Views 
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) SCR Ruggiero met with AWK and Governor Weesa on 
<br>September 28 in the Governor's Palace in Kandahar City. The 
<br>Representative of Canada in Kandahar (RoCK) Ben Rowswell also 
<br>attended the meeting, which was held in a wood-paneled room, 
<br>beneath a large photo of President Hamid Karzai. (Note: 
<br>While we must deal with AWK as the head of the Provincial 
<br>Council, he is widely understood to be corrupt and a 
<br>narcotics trafficker. End Note) AWK, dressed in a crisp 
<br>white shalwar kameez and pinstriped vest, appeared nervous, 
<br>though eager to express his views on the international 
<br>presence in Kandahar. 
<br>
<br>The Importance of Good Governance 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) SCR emphasized the criticality of good governance in 
<br>the province, and said the United States would like to see 
<br>improvement in the post-election period. He said the United 
<br>States is ready to work with the GIRoA to strengthen key 
<br>provincial and district level governance, but we are only 
<br>willing to expend our resources in people and programs if we 
<br>have confidence those resources will pay off and make a real 
<br>difference. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Both AWK and Weesa acknowledged there was a 
<br>credibility gap between the public and the government. Weesa 
<br>said it was a problem that in the 10 months he had been in 
<br>office, the government had not been able to deliver 24-hour 
<br>electricity to the people, and that 150 factories had closed 
<br>because of it. He said people looked to NGOs more than to 
<br>the government to deliver services, and he complained that 
<br>NGOs poach workers from the government by offering higher 
<br>wages. SCR emphasized the importance of naming credible 
<br>provincial governors and district officials before the 
<br>inauguration to send a positive signal on good governance to 
<br>the Afghan people and the international community. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) AWK suggested one way of fighting corruption in the 
<br>province would be to re-establish and empower district 
<br>shuras, instead of judges or police, to settle local 
<br>disputes. Currently there is only one judge for the five 
<br>districts around Kandahar City, he said, and a council of 
<br>local elders would be more effective at resolving land, water 
<br>and other disputes. (Note: there are a total of seven judges 
<br>for all 17 districts in the province.) "You can easily bribe 
<br>the chief of police or a judge,8 he said, &but you can't 
<br>bribe 50 elders." He said the provincial council, with the 
<br>support of the governor, could initiate the formation of 
<br>these district shuras, which would consist of 10-15 elders 
<br>elected by the people. 
<br>
<br>Infrastructure Priorities, Private Security Contractors and 
<br>Conflicts of Interest 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) AWK said he had been in Kandahar almost continuously 
<br>since 1992, and that the U.S. reputation in the province was 
<br>built on the back of two key infrastructure projects done in 
<br>the 1950s and 60s. He said what would make a difference to 
<br>the population today would be similar large-scale, 
<br>labor-intensive projects that would provide jobs to the 
<br>people and keep them from being recruited by the Taliban. 
<br>AWK cautioned against the use of small scale projects and 
<br>
<br>KABUL 00003068 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>additional cash-for-work programs; he stated that the use of 
<br>implementing partners does not allow expenditure of 
<br>development resources to reach villagers and other local 
<br>Afghans. Both he and Weesa added that it should be the local 
<br>elders who are empowered to distribute these jobs, not 
<br>officials or companies from outside. 
<br>
<br>Putting Private Security Under the Direction of the 
<br>Provincial Council 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) In the same vein of providing "local solutions to 
<br>local problems," as he put it, AWK recommended a "local 
<br>solution" to the problem of providing security in the area. 
<br>He said that currently, there are many jihadi commanders with 
<br>militias who independently provide protection to convoys and 
<br>projects, but that a proposal before the Ministry of Interior 
<br>would bring all these commanders under one umbrella in 
<br>Kandahar, with one person given the license for the private 
<br>security sector. He said there would be a meeting Wednesday 
<br>(September 30) of all the security companies, under the 
<br>auspices of the Provincial Council, to appoint this 
<br>representative to send to Kabul. (Note: AWK is understood to 
<br>have a stake in private security contracting, and has 
<br>aggressively lobbied the Canadians to have his security 
<br>services retained for the Dahla Dam refurbishment. Both he 
<br>and the governor have tried to exert control over how 
<br>contracts are awarded in the province ) all of which could 
<br>be a significant conflict of interest in the province. End 
<br>Note.) 
<br>
<br>Elections: What's the Point? 
<br>--------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) In answer to a question from the RoCK and the SCR 
<br>about the credibility of the elections, AWK said democracy 
<br>was new for Afghanistan, and that people in the region did 
<br>not understand the point of having one election, let alone 
<br>two. "The people do not like change," he said. "They think, 
<br>the President is alive, and everything is fine. Why have an 
<br>election?" 
<br>
<br>Comment 
<br>----- 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) The meeting with AWK highlights one of our major 
<br>challenges in Afghanistan: how to fight corruption and 
<br>connect the people to their government, when the key 
<br>government officials are themselves corrupt. Given AWK's 
<br>reputation for shady dealings, his recommendations for large, 
<br>costly infrastructure projects should be viewed with a 
<br>healthy dose of skepticism. Still, his observations about 
<br>the unintended consequences of how NGOs and other 
<br>international partners do their work, e.g. "poaching" of 
<br>government staff, track with some of our own concerns, 
<br>including about how to promote Afghan-led solutions. We will 
<br>continue to urge AWK to improve his own credibility gap as 
<br>well as that of the GIRoA.
