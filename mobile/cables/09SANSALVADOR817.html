<br>SUBJECT: WAVE OF PROTESTS MAY SIGNAL FMLN EFFORT TO
<br>UNDERMINE FUNES
<br>
<br>Classified By: CHARGE D'AFFAIRES ROBERT BLAU FOR REASONS 1.5 (B and D).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY. A recent wave of protests organized by a
<br>so-called environmental group, "La Coordinadora Nacional de
<br>Medio Ambiente (CNMA)", are likely part of a movement by
<br>hard-line elements of the FMLN to undermine President Funes.
<br>Over the past several weeks, the CNMA has carried out
<br>large-scale, coordinated protests throughout the country
<br>ostensibly protesting GOES plans to continue with the
<br>construction of the hydroelectric dam "Chaparral" and
<br>perceived inequities in the seed disbursement program to
<br>farmers. It seems that hard-line members of the FMLN party
<br>are using this relatively unknown organization to vent their
<br>frustration about the direction of economic policy and
<br>directly challenge the President. END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) On August 26, the CNMA coordinated a sophisticated
<br>series of road blocks at nine key points in the highway
<br>system across the country in the morning hours, effectively
<br>bringing traffic to a halt. Many key transportation arteries
<br>were blocked off, including the Pan-American Highway. This
<br>protest included wide-spread participation and there were
<br>reports of vandalism and destruction of property. Police
<br>were unable to restore order until the afternoon. Past CNMA
<br>protests consisted of no more than small-scale demonstrations
<br>outside of the Presidential Palace.
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) According to press reports, CNMA is protesting
<br>President Funes' decisions to proceed with the construction
<br>of the state-owned hydroelectric dam "Chaparral" and the
<br>planned cutbacks in the government-managed seed distribution
<br>program. In each case, only a small portion of the
<br>population is adversely affected by the policy decisions.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) COMMENT: Mass street protests are part of the
<br>traditional FMLN play book and are one battlefront in an
<br>ongoing struggle for power between the orthodox FMLN and
<br>President Funes. Funes said at a meeting Thursday August 27
<br>that his administration will not yield to blackmail. There
<br>is broad public support for the need for Funes to prevail.
<br>END COMMENT.
