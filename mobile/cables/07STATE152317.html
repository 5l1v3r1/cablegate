<br> 
<br>¶1. (S) URGENT ACTION REQUEST:  IN SEPTEMBER DURING THEIR 
<br>MEETING AT THE APEC SUMMIT IN SYDNEY AUSTRALIA, PRESIDENT 
<br>BUSH DISCUSSED WITH CHINESE PRESIDENT HU STRONG CONCERNS 
<br>RELATING TO THE ONGOING TRANSSHIPMENT VIA BEIJING OF KEY 
<br>BALLISTIC MISSILE PARTS FROM NORTH KOREA TO IRAN'S MISSILE 
<br>PROGRAM.  PRESIDENT BUSH PLEDGED TO RESPOND TO PRESIDENT 
<br>HU'S REQUESTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  EMBASSY SHOULD ON 
<br>NOVEMBER 3 AT THE MOST EFFECTIVE LEVEL POSSIBLE, DELIVER 
<br>THE NON-PAPER IN PARA 8 WHICH RELATES TO SPECIFIC, TIME- 
<br>SENSITIVE INFORMATION ABOUT AN IMMINENT TRANSSHIPMENT.  IN 
<br>ADDITION, AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY POST SHOULD DELIVER 
<br>THE NON-PAPER IN PARA 9 TO MFA AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL 
<br>POSSIBLE, PREFERABLY BY THE AMBASSADOR SINCE THIS IS IN 
<br>RESPONSE TO PRESIDENTIAL-LEVEL DISCUSSIONS. 
<br> 
<br>---------- 
<br>OBJECTIVES 
<br>---------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S/REL CHINA) Post should: 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>--(This point for November 3 Delivery) Request China to stop an 
<br>imminent shipment to Iran's ballistic missile program.  This is the 
<br>same cargo that the Ambassador shared about on October 25 (ref E).  It 
<br>is now scheduled to leave Beijing airport on November 4. 
<br> 
<br>--(This point for November 3 Delivery) Note the importance of this 
<br>demarche since it relates to a topic discussed by Presidents Bush and 
<br>Hu in Sydney.  Embassy should further note that the Embassy will be 
<br>seeking an appointment at the highest level possible to convey a more 
<br>extensive presentation on this topic of ballistic missile parts from 
<br>North Korea to Iran. 
<br> 
<br>--Remind Chinese officials that President Bush has been personally 
<br>engaged on the issue of the transshipment of ballistic missile parts 
<br>between North Korea and Iran via Beijing and that he raised this issue 
<br>with President Hu at the APEC Summit. 
<br> 
<br>-- Seek information on the steps China has taken since the APEC 
<br>discussion to address this issue and impress on them the necessity for 
<br>China to take immediate strong action. 
<br> 
<br>-- Stress that the credibility of UN Security Council actions must be 
<br>maintained by vigorous implementation by UN Member States of UNSC 
<br>resolutions calling for Chapter VII sanctions, particularly 1718, 
<br>1737, and 1747. 
<br> 
<br>--Indicate that the U.S. believes that the proliferation of missile 
<br>technology between North Korea and Iran will increase and that these 
<br>two countries will attempt to conduct these transfers through Chinese 
<br>territory. 
<br> 
<br>--Emphasize the need to inspect cargo and personal goods on regularly 
<br>scheduled flights transiting Beijing from North Korea to Iran in order 
<br>to detect and deter these shipments. 
<br> 
<br>--Explain to Chinese officials that the U.S. carefully reviews the 
<br>intelligence material that we have on shipments before we share it, 
<br>and we ask that Chinese authorities respect this and act on our 
<br>information accordingly and appropriately. 
<br> 
<br>--Indicate that the United States believes that we can work together 
<br>cooperatively and effectively on these issues. 
<br> 
<br>--Express our willingness to continue to share as much information as 
<br>possible to assist China's efforts to uphold these UN Security Council 
<br>resolutions. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
<br>Background: Ballistic Missile Parts Shipped via Beijing Between North 
<br>Korea and Iran. 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S/Rel China) Iran and North Korea have continued their 
<br>longstanding cooperation on ballistic missile technology, via air- 
<br>shipments of ballistic-missile related items.   We assess that some of 
<br>these shipments consist of ballistic missile jet vanes that frequently 
<br>transit Beijing on regularly scheduled flights on Air Koryo and Iran 
<br>Air.  We believe that the Shahid Bagheri Industrial Group (SBIG) is 
<br>the probable end user for these parts.  SBIG is listed in the annex to 
<br>UNSCR 1737 and these jet vanes are controlled under Item 10.A.2 of the 
<br>Missile Technology Control Regime and Item 6 of China's missile- 
<br>related export control regulations.  Moreover, UNSCRs 1718 and 1737 
<br>prohibit the transfer to or from North Korea or Iran, respectively, of 
<br>jet vanes and any other item listed in UNSC document S/2006/815. 
<br>These shipments therefore represent violations of UNSCRs 1718 and 
<br>¶1737. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (S/Rel China) The U.S. has raised this issue with China at the 
<br>highest levels several times in the last few months.  In May 2007, the 
<br>United States informed China of imminent shipments on three separate 
<br>occasions (Refs A,B and C).  Though Chinese officials informed Embassy 
<br>Beijing that China's investigations have found no evidence of these 
<br>transfers, it appears that these shipments did occur and are 
<br>continuing to transit via Beijing.  In addition this issue was raised 
<br>by ISN PDAS Patricia McNerney during bilateral nonproliferation talks 
<br>in August 2007 (Ref D).  The Deputy Secretary also raised this issue 
<br>with Executive Vice Foreign Minister (EVFM) Dai Bingguo via during a 
<br>telephone conversation in August.  Finally, in September 2007, 
<br>President Bush discussed this issue with Chinese President Hu at the 
<br>APEC summit in Sydney.  The two leaders agreed that the USG would 
<br>provide the PRC with further information on these transfers. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (S/Rel China) On October 25 the U.S. provided PRC officials with 
<br>detailed information, including the airway bill and flight number, of 
<br>another imminent shipment of military related goods from North Korea 
<br>to Iran via Beijing.  This shipment was also assessed as destined for 
<br>Iran's solid propellant missile development organization, the Shahid 
<br>Bagheri Industries Group (SBIG).  We now have information that the 
<br>goods will be shipped on November 4 and insist on a substantive 
<br>response from China to this information. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (S/Rel China) Our information indicates that at least 10 air 
<br>shipments of jet vanes have transited Beijing thus far and that these 
<br>shipments will not only continue but will also grow in volume.  We 
<br>have encouraged the Chinese to undertake frequent inspections of cargo 
<br>on Air Koryo or Iran Air flights transiting Beijing from North Korea 
<br>to both deter and detect these shipments. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (S/Rel China) The Department is seeking both immediate action on 
<br>this new information and a strategic approach with regards to this 
<br>critical issue.  We assess that the best way to prevent these 
<br>shipments in the future is for Chinese authorities to take action, 
<br>such as those identified in para 9, that will make the Beijing airport 
<br>a less hospitable transfer point. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------- 
<br>NON-PAPER ON URGENT MATTER TO BE DELIVERED NOVEMBER 3 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------- 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (S/Rel China) Begin points: 
<br> 
<br>-- Last week we raised with you information regarding North Korean 
<br>plans to send a shipment, probably for Iran's ballistic missile 
<br>program, to Iran.  We believe the cargo is intended for Iran's Shahid 
<br>Bagheri Industrial Group (SBIG), which is responsible for Iran's 
<br>solid-propellant ballistic missile program.  You had requested 
<br>additional information. 
<br> 
<br>-- We now have reason to believe that the items above will be shipped 
<br>to Iran via scheduled Iran Air flight on November 4. 
<br> 
<br>--If these goods are missile-related, North Korea is prohibited under 
<br>UNSCR 1718 from exporting missile-related items and UN Member States 
<br>are prohibited from importing those items.  In addition, North Korea 
<br>would potentially be precluded under UNSCR 1737 from transferring 
<br>these items to Iran if they are among the missile-related components 
<br>included in S/2006/815 or if North Korea or China determines that they 
<br>would contribute to the development of nuclear weapon delivery 
<br>systems.  Moreover, SBIG is designated in United Nations Security 
<br>Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1737 and, as such, is subject to the 
<br>mandatory asset freeze called for in the resolution. With these 
<br>concerns in mind we are asking that Chinese authorities investigate 
<br>this shipment and prohibit it from proceeding to Iran. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br>BEGIN NON-PAPER FOR DELIVERY BY AMBASSADOR 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (S/REL CHINA) Begin Points: 
<br> 
<br>--Over the past several months we have raised with Chinese officials 
<br>the problem of ballistic missile-related transfers between Iran and 
<br>North Korea being transshipped through China.  President Bush raised 
<br>U.S. concerns on this matter with President Hu during the APEC summit 
<br>in Sydney, demonstrating the importance of the issue to the United 
<br>States.  In response to President Hu's request for additional details, 
<br>we are providing you further information regarding these activities. 
<br>Specifically, we are urgently providing information regarding an 
<br>imminent shipment of serious concern. 
<br> 
<br>-- North Korea is prohibited under UNSCR 1718 from exporting missile- 
<br>related items and UN Member States are prohibited from importing those 
<br>items.  In addition, North Korea would  potentially be precluded under 
<br>UNSCR 1737 from transferring these items to Iran if they are among the 
<br>missile-related components included in S/2006/815 or if North Korea or 
<br>China determines that they would contribute to the development of 
<br>nuclear weapon delivery systems.  Moreover, SBIG is designated in 
<br>United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1737 and, as such, 
<br>is subject to the mandatory asset freeze called for in the resolution. 
<br>With these concerns in mind we are insisting that Chinese authorities 
<br>urgently investigate this shipment and prohibit it from proceeding to 
<br>Iran. 
<br> 
<br>--We are very concerned that North Korean shipments of jet vanes occur 
<br>on regularly scheduled commercial air flights transiting through 
<br>Beijing.  We believe this has been the case on about 10 flights. 
<br> 
<br>--These items are likely intended for Iran's solid propellant missile 
<br>development organization, the Shahid Bagheri Industries Group (SBIG). 
<br> 
<br>--These cargo shipments probably include front companies. 
<br> 
<br>--We have identified a large number of shipments beginning late last 
<br>year of what are probably ballistic missile-related items that have 
<br>transited Beijing, and we would like to share further information on 
<br>these shipments. 
<br> 
<br>--14 December 2006: A delegation from SBIG returned from Pyongyang 
<br>probably via Beijing and transported what we assess to be jet vanes 
<br>for a solid propellant medium range ballistic missile (MRBM) under 
<br>development in Iran. 
<br> 
<br>--On or about 15 January 2007: North Korea delivered what were 
<br>probably jet vanes for Iran's developmental solid propellant MRBM to 
<br>SBIG via Beijing on board regularly-scheduled commercial passenger 
<br>flights. 
<br> 
<br>--On or around 23 January 2007: North Korea delivered what were 
<br>probably jet vanes for Iran's developmental solid propellant MRBM to 
<br>SBIG via Beijing on board regularly-scheduled commercial passenger 
<br>flights. 
<br> 
<br>--On or about 16 May 2007: An air shipment composed of four what were 
<br>probably jet vanes from North Korea to Iran for SBIG was scheduled to 
<br>depart North Korea and transit Beijing via regularly-scheduled 
<br>commercial passenger flights. 
<br> 
<br>--On or about 24 May 2007: An air shipment composed of five what were 
<br>probably jet vanes from North Korea to Iran for SBIG was scheduled to 
<br>depart North Korea and transit Beijing via regularly-scheduled 
<br>commercial passenger flights. 
<br> 
<br>--On or about 6 June 2007: An air shipment composed of four what were 
<br>probably jet vanes from North Korea to Iran for SBIG was scheduled to 
<br>depart North Korea and transit Beijing via regularly-scheduled 
<br>commercial passenger flights. 
<br> 
<br>-- On or about 12 June 2007: An air shipment composed of five what 
<br>were probably jet vanes from North Korea to Iran for SBIG was 
<br>scheduled to depart North Korea and transit Beijing via regularly- 
<br>scheduled commercial passenger flights. 
<br> 
<br>--On or about 14 June 2007: An air shipment composed of three what 
<br>were probably jet vanes from North Korea to Iran for SBIG was 
<br>scheduled to depart North Korea and transit Beijing via regularly- 
<br>scheduled commercial passenger flights. 
<br> 
<br>--On or about 14 July 2007: An air shipment composed of ten what were 
<br>probably jet vanes from North Korea to Iran for SBIG was scheduled to 
<br>depart North Korea and transit Beijing via regularly-scheduled 
<br>commercial passenger flights. 
<br> 
<br>--On or about 26 July 2007: An air shipment possibly composed of an 
<br>unknown number of jet vanes from North Korea to Iran for SBIG was 
<br>scheduled to depart North Korea and transit Beijing via regularly- 
<br>scheduled commercial passenger flights. 
<br> 
<br>--On or about 22 August: An air shipment possibly composed of one jet 
<br>vane from North Korea to Iran for SBIG was scheduled to depart North 
<br>Korea and transit Beijing via regularly-scheduled commercial passenger 
<br>flights. 
<br> 
<br>--We believe that the number of jet vanes sent to Iran will increase 
<br>dramatically in the future. 
<br> 
<br>--To date we believe that about 40 probable jet vanes have been sent 
<br>from North Korea to Iran. 
<br> 
<br>--The contract for these components called for a total number of 500 
<br>and we assess that shipments of these may increase to a rate of 100- 
<br>160 per month. 
<br> 
<br>--In addition, our information indicates that a second order of 1,500 
<br>components - possibly additional jet vanes - was agreed to in December 
<br>of last year. 
<br> 
<br>-- We believe that this trade will continue to utilize regularly- 
<br>scheduled commercial passenger flights. 
<br> 
<br>--As we have discussed on several occasions, Iran also has been 
<br>seeking probable tungsten-copper alloy plates from China's Dalian 
<br>Sunny Industries, also known as LIMMT.  Dalian Sunny Industries 
<br>shipped part of an order for this material in September.  These plates 
<br>are suitable for Iranian domestic production of jet vanes or as an 
<br>insulator for ballistic missile components.  Iran could be seeking 
<br>these plates in case North Korea is unable to provide the quantity or 
<br>quality of jet vanes required. 
<br> 
<br>--We urge you to prevent such shipments via whatever action you deem 
<br>appropriate, including frequent inspection of Iran Air and Air Koryo 
<br>flights.  The use of regularly-scheduled commercial passenger flights 
<br>indicates that frequent regular inspections of Iran Air flights and 
<br>Air Koryo flights are in order and would help deter these shipments in 
<br>the future. 
<br> 
<br>--We will continue to provide you with relevant information to help 
<br>end this proliferation.
