<br>REF: TEL AVIV 1086 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones, Reason 1.4 (b) (d) 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (C) Summary.  Representative Gary Ackerman (D, New York), 
<br>Chairman of the Middle East and South Asia Subcommittee of 
<br>the House International Relations Committee, accompanied by 
<br>the Ambassador, met with Opposition Leader Binyamin Netanyahu 
<br>at the Knesset April 11.  The discussion covered Netanyahu's 
<br>ideas on how to pressure Iran in order to block its nuclear 
<br>program and topple President Ahmadinejad; Netanyahu's views 
<br>on dealing with the Palestinians; his critique of Prime 
<br>Minister Olmert's handling of the Second Lebanon War; and 
<br>Netanyahu's analysis of Israel's domestic political 
<br>situation. On Iran, Netanyahu advocated intensified financial 
<br>pressures, including a U.S.-led divestment effort focused 
<br>largely on European companies that invest in Iran, as the 
<br>best way to topple Ahmadinejad.  On the Palestinians, 
<br>Netanyahu did not object to supporting President Abbas but 
<br>said Israel and the U.S. should first focus more on 
<br>"strangling" Hamas.  Netanyahu asserted that Israel's 
<br>mishandling of the Lebanon war had strengthened Israel's 
<br>enemies.  He predicted that Olmert would not be able to stay 
<br>in power much longer, then described several different 
<br>mechanisms for forming a new government.  Netanyahu expressed 
<br>confidence that the Israeli public recognized that he had 
<br>been right, that unilateral withdrawals were a mistake, and 
<br>that the priority now must be stopping Iran.  Netanyahu noted 
<br>that he thought dropping the "right of return" was the acid 
<br>test of Arab intentions and insisted that he would never 
<br>allow a single Palestinian refugee to return to Israel.  End 
<br>Summary. 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (U) House Middle East and South Asia Subcommittee 
<br>Chairman Gary Ackerman, accompanied by the Ambassador, Pol 
<br>Couns, Subcommittee Staff Director David Adams, and Staff 
<br>member Howard Diamond called on Opposition and Likud Party 
<br>Leader Binyamin Netanyahu at the Knesset April 11.  Netanyahu 
<br>was joined by foreign policy adviser Dore Gold and MFA North 
<br>American Department Congressional liaison Eyal Sela. 
<br> 
<br>Toppling Ahmadinejad 
<br>-------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C) Representative Ackerman told Netanyahu that in his 
<br>meeting the day before with Egyptian President Mubarak, he 
<br>had asked Mubarak if military action were necessary to 
<br>prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, should the 
<br>strike be carried out by the U.S. or Israel?  Mubarak had 
<br>responded that if it came to that, the U.S. should do it and 
<br>Israel should stay out.  Netanyahu said he took Mubarak's 
<br>point, but commented that he thought the Iranian regime, or 
<br>at least President Ahmadinejad, could be toppled by economic 
<br>pressure, including a divestment campaign. Noting that 
<br>economic sanctions lose their effect over time, but can be 
<br>powerful in the short term.  The goal should be to encourage 
<br>Ahmadinejad's political rivals to remove him from power. 
<br>Afterward, if the pressure could be maintained it might be 
<br>possible to bring down the entire Iranian regime, but that 
<br>would also entail identifying alternative leaders.  The idea 
<br>was to use economic pressure to create a public sense of 
<br>regime failure.  Netanyahu said he had consulted with noted 
<br>historian Bernard Lewis, who believed that Iran would be less 
<br>dangerous once Ahmadinejad was removed. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (C) Netanyahu said there were three bills in Congress 
<br>designed to divest U.S. pension funds from investing in about 
<br>300, mostly European, companies currently doing business in 
<br>Iran.  Divestment would immediately bring down the credit 
<br>ratings of these companies, thus forcing them to respond. 
<br>Netanyahu urged Congress to support the divestment 
<br>legislation, adding that he also planned to use a visit to 
<br>the U.S. to raise the issue with Wall Street fund managers. 
<br>His approach was to tie in Darfur to expand the scope of 
<br>anti-genocide divestment and link it to U.S. policy goals. 
<br>Netanyahu said he was unsure that financial pressures would 
<br>be enough to stop Iran's nuclear program, but he was 
<br>confident they would succeed in bringing down Ahmadinejad. 
<br>He commended Dore Gold's efforts to put Ahmadinejad on a 
<br>genocide watch list as part of a broader effort to 
<br>delegitimize the Iranian President.  Asked about the quality 
<br>of U.S. and Israeli intelligence on Iran, Netanyahu said his 
<br>nightmare was that we had missed part of the Iranian program. 
<br>He added that if the current intelligence was correct, it 
<br>would take Iran a few more years to develop a nuclear weapon. 
<br> He agreed with Ambassador Jones' assessment that 
<br> 
<br>TEL AVIV 00001114  002 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Ahmadinejad's announcement of a breakthrough in Iran's 
<br>centrifuge program was probably exaggerated.  It would be 
<br>critical, Netanyahu stressed, to target companies investing 
<br>in Iran's energy sector. 
<br> 
<br>Bring Down Hamas 
<br>---------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (C) Congressman Ackerman asked Netanyahu for his views on 
<br>Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.  Netanyahu said Abbas 
<br>was a "nice man who means well," but he added that Israel and 
<br>the U.S. should focus on "bringing down Hamas" through an 
<br>"economic squeeze."  Netanyahu asserted that eight months 
<br>ago, the Hamas government had been on the brink of collapse, 
<br>but had become stronger because Israel became weaker as a 
<br>result of the Lebanon war.  Without elaborating, Netanyahu 
<br>said it would be easier to weaken Hamas than to strengthen 
<br>Abbas. 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (C) Netanyahu commented that Shimon Peres had admitted to 
<br>him that the Oslo process had been based on a mistaken 
<br>economic premise, and as a result European and U.S. 
<br>assistance to the Palestinians had gone to create a bloated 
<br>bureaucracy, with PA employees looking to the international 
<br>community to meet their payroll.  Netanyahu predicted that 
<br>Palestinians would vote for Abbas if they believe that he can 
<br>deliver the money.  He suggested putting in place an 
<br>"economic squeeze with an address," so that Hamas would 
<br>receive the popular blame.  Asked if Fatah knew how to 
<br>conduct an election campaign, Netanyahu said the Palestinian 
<br>patronage system should be forced to collapse, which would 
<br>have an immediate impact since the entire Palestinian economy 
<br>was based on graft and patronage. Instead, he asserted, the 
<br>opposite was happening.  Hamas was also handling the prisoner 
<br>release issue well since they had created the impression that 
<br>Hamas was in control of the process and "sticking it to the 
<br>Israelis." 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (C) Congressman Ackerman asked if Abbas would survive 
<br>politically.  Netanyahu said he was unsure, since politics 
<br>were stressful, especially Palestinian politics.  The policy, 
<br>he added, should be to starve the NUG.  If any money is 
<br>given, it should go directly to Abbas.  Netanyahu said it was 
<br>not clear the GOI has a policy, there was a general climate 
<br>of weakness. 
<br> 
<br>Lebanon War Failures 
<br>-------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (C) Turning to the Second Lebanon War, Netanyahu said the 
<br>problem was not the war's goals but rather the disconnect 
<br>between goals and methods.  If the IDF had used a flanking 
<br>move by a superior ground force, it could have won easily. 
<br>Instead, Israel "dripped troops into their gunsights," an 
<br>approach he termed "stupid."  The top leadership had lacked a 
<br>sense of military maneuver.  In addition, they had been 
<br>afraid to take military casualties, but instead got many 
<br>civilian casualties.  If Olmert had mobilized the reserves in 
<br>ten days, seized ground, destroyed Hizballah in southern 
<br>Lebanon, and then withdrawn, he would be a hero today. 
<br>Instead, Netanyahu predicted, Olmert will not last 
<br>politically.  Olmert's current public support levels of three 
<br>percent were unsustainable. 
<br> 
<br>A New Government? 
<br>----------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (C) Netanyahu said the pressure on Olmert was 
<br>accumulating as a result of corruption investigations as well 
<br>as the impending release of the Winograd Commission's interim 
<br>report.  Olmert could be pushed out as a result of a 
<br>rebellion within the Kadima Party.  Kadima members are 
<br>realizing they cannot allow Olmert to stay in power, but 
<br>Kadima itself might collapse since it was a "fake party." 
<br>Netanyahu described several options, including Kadima 
<br>replacing Olmert, a new coalition formed in the Knesset, or 
<br>Netanyahu's preferred option, new elections.  New elections, 
<br>he stated, are supported by sixty-five percent of the public. 
<br> Netanyahu insisted he was in no rush since he was "enjoying 
<br>the time with his family" and rebuilding the Likud Party. 
<br>Likud was reaching thousands of new supporters, including 
<br>many highly educated professionals and high tech 
<br>entrepreneurs, through the internet. 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (C) Netanyahu asserted there was a growing sense in the 
<br>public that he had been right in the last election. 
<br> 
<br>TEL AVIV 00001114  003 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Unilateral "retreats" (i.e. such as the withdrawals from Gaza 
<br>and southern Lebanon) were the wrong way to go.  Israel had 
<br>allowed an Iranian enclave to establish itself in Gaza. 
<br>Syria was arming itself for the first time in 20 years, 
<br>Hizballah had rearmed since the war, and Gaza was being 
<br>turned into a bunker.  Egypt was not doing on a twelve mile 
<br>front along the Gaza border what Jordan was doing on a 
<br>150-mile front.  The way out was to stop Iran, thereby 
<br>dealing with the octopus, not just its tentacles. 
<br> 
<br>Right of Return the Acid Test 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶11.  (C) Netanyahu stated that a return to the 1967 borders 
<br>and dividing Jerusalem was not a solution since further 
<br>withdrawals would only whet the appetite of radical Islam. 
<br>Ackerman asked if the Palestinians would accept peace based 
<br>on the 1967 lines.  Netanyahu said he would not agree to such 
<br>a withdrawal since the 1967 lines were indefensible, but he 
<br>added that the "right of return" was the real acid test of 
<br>Arab intentions.  Instead of Israel making more step-by-step 
<br>concessions, Israel should insist that further concessions be 
<br>linked to reciprocal steps toward peace.  The Palestinians 
<br>must drop the right of return and accept Israel's right to 
<br>exist.  The Arab initiative did not meet this standard since 
<br>it keeps the right of return open.  Israel will only have a 
<br>peace partner when the Palestinians drop the right of return. 
<br>Asked whether Israel could accept case by case exceptions, 
<br>Netanyahu insisted not one refugee could ever return. Israel, 
<br>after all, was not asking for the right of Jews to return to 
<br>Baghdad or Cairo. 
<br> 
<br>¶12.  (C) Netanyahu said UNSCR 242 was not a bad formula since 
<br>it did not specify precisely from which territories Israel 
<br>would withdraw.  After the withdrawals from Gaza and Lebanon, 
<br>there was deep disillusionment among Israelis about the 
<br>principle of land for peace.  Even the noted Israeli leftist 
<br>writer AB Yehoshua had said in a recent interview that he 
<br>despaired about peace because the Arabs wanted all of Israel. 
<br> From 1948 to 1967, the conflict had not been about occupied 
<br>territories, but that point had been obscured by "effective 
<br>propaganda."  The root of the conflict was an Arab desire to 
<br>destroy Israel, which had now become part of the larger 
<br>ambitions of radical Islam. 
<br> 
<br>¶13.  (C) The 1967 borders were not the solution since Israel 
<br>was the only force blocking radical Islam's agenda of 
<br>overrunning Jordan and Saudi Arabia.  Netanyahu proposed that 
<br>Israel offer to work with the Saudis against Iran.  If Iran 
<br>was not stopped, there would be no agreement with the 
<br>Palestinians, and the peace treaties with Jordan and Egypt 
<br>would come under tremendous pressure.  There could be no 
<br>deterrence against "crazies" such as Ahmadinejad.  Netanyahu 
<br>advised Congress to expedite the legislative effort for 
<br>divestment.  If that did not work, we could reconsider other 
<br>options. Congressman Ackerman said that if Netanyahu came to 
<br>Washington, he would hold a hearing on divestment. 
<br> 
<br>¶14.  (U) CODEL Ackerman did not have the opportunity to clear 
<br>this message.
