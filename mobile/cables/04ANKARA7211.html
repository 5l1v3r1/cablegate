<br>SUBJECT: ERDOGAN AND AK PARTY AFTER TWO YEARS IN POWER: 
<br>TRYING TO GET A GRIP ON THEMSELVES, ON TURKEY, ON EUROPE 
<br> 
<br>(U) Classified by Ambassador Eric Edelman; reasons: E.O. 
<br>12958 1.4 (a,b,c,d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: PM Erdogan and his ruling AK Party seem to 
<br>have a firm grip on power -- if for no other reasons that 
<br>there is currently no viable alternative and inertia weighs 
<br>heavily in politics.  Nevertheless, Erdogan and his party 
<br>face enormous challenges if they are successfully to embrace 
<br>core principles of open society, carry out EU harmonization, 
<br>and develop and implement foreign policies in harmony with 
<br>core U.S. interests.  End summary. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) As PM Erdogan strode through the EU corridors of power 
<br>Dec. 16-17 with his semi-pro soccer player's swagger and 
<br>phalanx of sycophantic advisors, he may have seemed a strong 
<br>candidate for European leader of the year.  A regional leader 
<br>to be reckoned with for a decade to come.  The man who won 
<br>Turkey the beginning of accession negotiations with the EU. 
<br>Who broke loose three decades of frozen Turkish policy on 
<br>Cyprus.  Who drove major human rights reforms through 
<br>parliament and through constitutional amendments.  Whose 
<br>rhetorical skill, while etched with populist victimhood, is 
<br>redolent with traditional and religious allusions that 
<br>resonate deeply in the heartland, deeply in the anonymous 
<br>exurban sprawls.  Who remains the highly popular tribune of 
<br>the people, without a viable or discernible political 
<br>rival...outside his own ruling AKP. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) In short, Erdogan looks unbeatable.  But is he?  And 
<br>is he willing to give relations with the U.S. the leadership 
<br>and momentum they need from the Turkish side? 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) Erdogan has a two-thirds majority in parliament.  Main 
<br>opposition left-of-center CHP amounts to no more than a bunch 
<br>of elitist ankle-biters.  There is currently no serious, 
<br>broad-based political alternative, owing to Erdogan's 
<br>rhetorical dominance and control of the debate on social 
<br>questions close to the hearts of the center-right majority in 
<br>Turkey; other party leaders' political bankruptcy; and the 
<br>stultifying effect of current party and election laws on 
<br>entry for younger, untainted political aspirants.  AKP argues 
<br>that the economy, at least from the perspective of macro 
<br>indicators and continued willingness of emerging-market 
<br>portfolio investors to buy the expectations and sell the 
<br>facts, appears to have stabilized.  Moreover, the authority 
<br>of AKP's nationwide party machine is blurring with the 
<br>Turkish State's executive power at the provincial and 
<br>district level and with municipal functions to an extent not 
<br>seen since the days of the one-party state.  These factors 
<br>seem set to continue for the foreseeable future. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) Yet Erdogan and AKP face politically fateful 
<br>challenges in three areas: foreign policy (EU, Iraq, Cyprus); 
<br>quality and sustainability of leadership and governance; and 
<br>resolution of questions fundamental to creation of an open, 
<br>prosperous society integrated with the broader world (place 
<br>of religion; identity and history; rule of law). 
<br> 
<br>EU 
<br>-- 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (U) Erdogan indexed his political survival to getting a 
<br>negotiation date from the EU.  He achieved that goal.  The 
<br>Wall Street Journal and other Western and Turkish media have 
<br>opined that the EU owes Turkey a fair negotiating process 
<br>leading to accession, with the Journal even putting the onus 
<br>on the EU by asserting that while Turkey is ready the 
<br>question is whether Europeans are ready for Turkey. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) But there's always a Monday morning and the debate on 
<br>the ground here is not so neat.  With euphoria at getting a 
<br>date having faded in 48 hours, Erdogan's political survival 
<br>and the difficulty of the tasks before him have become 
<br>substantially clearer.  Nationalists on right and left have 
<br>resumed accusations that Erdogan sold out Turkish national 
<br>interests (Cyprus) and Turkish traditions.  Core institutions 
<br>of the Turkish state, which remain at best wary of AKP, have 
<br>once again begun to probe for weaknesses and to feed 
<br>insinuations into the press in parallel with the 
<br>nationalists' assertions.  In the face of this Euro-aversion, 
<br>neither Erdogan nor his government has taken even minimal 
<br>steps to prepare the bureaucracy or public opinion to begin 
<br>tackling the fundamental -- some Turks would say insidious -- 
<br>legal, social, intellectual and spiritual changes that must 
<br>occur to turn harmonization on paper into true reform.  The 
<br>road ahead will surely be hard. 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (U) High-profile naysayers like main opposition CHP 
<br>chairman Baykal, former Ambassador Gunduz Aktan, and 
<br>political scientist Hasan Unal continue to castigate Erdogan. 
<br> But theirs is a routine whine.  More significant for us is 
<br>that many of our contacts cloak their lack of self-confidence 
<br>at Turkey's ability to join in expressions of skepticism that 
<br>the EU will let Turkey in.  And there is parallel widespread 
<br>skepticism that the EU will be around in attractive form in 
<br>ten years. 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C) The mood in AKP is no brighter, with one of FonMin 
<br>Gul's MFA advisors having described to UK polcounselor how 
<br>bruised Turkey feels at the EU's inconsistency during the 
<br>final negotiations leading to Dec. 17 (EU diplomats in Ankara 
<br>have given us the other side of the story).  Gul was 
<br>noticeably harder-line than Erdogan in public comments in the 
<br>lead-up to the Summit, and was harder-line in pre-Summit 
<br>negotiations in Brussels, according to UK polcounselor. 
<br>There was noticeable tension between Erdogan and Gul in 
<br>Brussels according to "Aksam" Ankara bureau chief Nuray 
<br>Basaran.  She also noted to us that when negotiations seemed 
<br>to have frozen up on Dec. 17, Erdogan's advisors got phone 
<br>calls from Putin advisors urging Turkey to walk.  Basaran 
<br>says that at least some of Erdogan's advisors urged him to do 
<br>so. 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (C) AKP's lack of cohesion as a party and lack of 
<br>openness as a government is reflected in the range of murky, 
<br>muddled motives for wanting to join the EU we have 
<br>encountered among those AKPers who say they favor pursuing 
<br>membership...or at least the process.  Some see the process 
<br>as the way to marginalize the Turkish military and what 
<br>remains of the arid "secularism" of Kemalism.  We have also 
<br>run into the rarely openly-spoken, but widespread belief 
<br>among adherents of the Turk-Islam synthesis that Turkey's 
<br>role is to spread Islam in Europe, "to take back Andalusia 
<br>and avenge the defeat at the siege of Vienna in 1683" as one 
<br>participant in a recent meeting at AKP's main think tank put 
<br>it.  This thinking parallels the logic behind the approach of 
<br>FonMin Gul ally and chief foreign policy advisor in the Prime 
<br>Ministry Ahmet Davutoglu, whose muddy opinion piece in the 
<br>Dec. 13 International Herald Tribune is in essence a call for 
<br>one-way multi-cultural tolerance, i.e., on the part of the EU. 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (C) Those from the more overtly religious side of AKP 
<br>whinge that the EU is a Christian club.  While some assert 
<br>that it is only through Turkish membership and spread of 
<br>Turkish values that the world can avoid the clash of 
<br>civilizations they allege the West is fomenting, others 
<br>express concern that harmonization and membership will water 
<br>down Islam and associated traditions in Turkey.  Indeed, as 
<br>AKP whip Sadullah Ergin confided to us recently, "If the EU 
<br>says yes, everything will look rosy for a short while.  Then 
<br>the real difficulties will start for AKP.  If the EU says no, 
<br>it will be initially difficult, but much easier over the long 
<br>run." 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (C) AKP also faces the nuts-and-bolts issue of how to 
<br>prepare for harmonization.  In choosing a chief negotiator 
<br>Erdogan will need to decide whether the risks that the man he 
<br>taps will successfully steal his political limelight outweigh 
<br>the political challenge his choice will face since it will be 
<br>the Turkish chief negotiator's responsibility to sell the EU 
<br>position to a recalcitrant Turkish cabinet.  It is because 
<br>the chief negotiator is likely to be ground down between EU 
<br>demands and a prickly domestic environment that some 
<br>observers speculate Erdogan might give the job to his chief 
<br>internal rival Gul. 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (C) At the same time the government must reportedly hire 
<br>a couple thousand people skilled in English or other major EU 
<br>languages and up to the bureaucratic demands of interfacing 
<br>with the Eurocrats who descend on ministries as harmonization 
<br>starts.  If the government continues to hire on the basis of 
<br>"one of us", i.e., from the Sunni brotherhood and lodge 
<br>milieu that has been serving as the pool for AKP's civil 
<br>service hiring, lack of competence will be a problem.  If the 
<br>government hires on the base of competence, its new hires 
<br>will be frustrated by the incompetence of AKP's previous 
<br>hires at all levels. 
<br> 
<br>Questions About AKP Leadership and Governance 
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶14. (C) Several factors will continue to degrade Erdogan's 
<br>and AKP's ability to effect fair and lasting reforms or to 
<br>take timely, positive decisions on issues of importance to 
<br>the U.S. 
<br> 
<br>¶15. (C) First is Erdogan's character. 
<br> 
<br>¶16. (C) In our contacts in Anatolia we have not yet detected 
<br>that Erdogan's hunger for absolute power and for the material 
<br>benefits of power have begun to erode his grassroots 
<br>popularity.  Others disagree.  Pollster and political analyst 
<br>Ismail Yildiz has asserted in three lengthy expositions to us 
<br>late in Dec. that the erosion has started.  We note that (1) 
<br>Yildiz expressed frustration to us that the AKP leadership 
<br>did not respond to his offer to provide political strategy 
<br>services; (2) he is currently connected to mainstream 
<br>opposition figures; and (3) he also runs a conspiracy-theory 
<br>web site.  So we treat his view cautiously.  However, judging 
<br>by his references and past experience in the Turkish State, 
<br>he appears to have maintained conncetions with the State 
<br>apparatus and to have a network of observers and data 
<br>collectors in all 81 provinces. 
<br> 
<br>¶17. (C) Inside the party, Erdogan's hunger for power reveals 
<br>itself in a sharp authoritarian style and deep distrust of 
<br>others: as a former spiritual advisor to Erdogan and his wife 
<br>Emine put it, "Tayyip Bey believes in God...but doesn't trust 
<br>him."  In surrounding himself with an iron ring of 
<br>sycophantic (but contemptuous) advisors, Erdogan has isolated 
<br>himself from a flow of reliable information, which partially 
<br>explains his failure to understand the context -- or real 
<br>facts -- of the U.S. operations in Tel Afar, Fallujah, and 
<br>elsewhere and his susceptibility to Islamist theories.  With 
<br>regard to Islamist influences on Erdogan, DefMin Gonul, who 
<br>is a conservative but worldly Muslim, recently described Gul 
<br>associate Davutoglu to us as "exceptionally dangerous." 
<br>Erdogan's other foreign policy advisors (Cuneyd Zapsu, Egemen 
<br>Bagis, Omer Celik, along with Mucahit Arslan and chef de 
<br>cabinet Hikmet Bulduk) are despised as inadequate, out of 
<br>touch and corrupt by all our AKP contacts from ministers to 
<br>MPs and party intellectuals. 
<br> 
<br>¶18. (C) Erdogan's pragmatism serves him well but he lacks 
<br>vision.  He and his principal AKP advisors, as well as FonMin 
<br>Gul and other ranking AKP officials, also lack analytic 
<br>depth.  He relies on poor-quality intel and on media 
<br>disinformation.  With the narrow world-view and wariness that 
<br>lingers from his Sunni brotherhood and lodge background, he 
<br>ducks his public relations responsibilities.  He (and those 
<br>around him, including FonMin Gul) indulge in pronounced 
<br>pro-Sunni prejudices and in emotional reactions that prevent 
<br>the development of coherent, practical domestic or foreign 
<br>policies. 
<br> 
<br>¶19. (C) Erdogan has compounded his isolation by constantly 
<br>traveling abroad -- reportedly 75 foreign trips in the past 
<br>two years -- with a new series of trips planned for 2005 to 
<br>Russia, "Eurasia", the Middle East and Africa.  Indeed, his 
<br>staff says 2005 is the "year of Africa", but they provide no 
<br>coherent reason why.  This grueling cycle of travel has 
<br>exhausted him and his staff and disrupted his ability to keep 
<br>his hand on the tiller of party, parliamentary group, and 
<br>government.  He has alienated many in the AKP parliamentary 
<br>group by his habit of harshly chewing out MPs.  Moreover, we 
<br>understand that MUSIAD, an Anatolia-wide group of businessmen 
<br>influential in Islamist circles who gave Erdogan key 
<br>financial support as AKP campaigned prior to the 2002 
<br>elections, is disaffected by Erdogan's unapproachability. 
<br>Judging by comments to us of insiders in the influential 
<br>Islamist lodge of Fethullah Gulen such as publicist 
<br>Abdurrahman Celik, the lodge, which has made some inroads 
<br>into AKP (Minister of Justice Cicek, Minister of Culture and 
<br>Tourism Mumcu; perhaps 60-80 of 368 MPs; some appointments to 
<br>the bureaucracy), has resumed the ambivalent attitude it 
<br>initially had toward Erdogan and AKP. 
<br> 
<br>¶20. (C) Second is the coalition nature of AKP, the limited 
<br>number of ministers whom Erdogan trusts, and the efforts of 
<br>some -- principally FonMin Gul but from time to time Cicek -- 
<br>to undermine Erdogan.  No one else in AKP comes close to 
<br>Erdogan in grassroots popularity.  However, Gul's readiness 
<br>to deprecate Erdogan within AKP and even to foreign visitors 
<br>(e.g., Israeli deputy PM Olmert) and his efforts to reduce 
<br>Erdogan's maneuvering room with hard-line criticisms of U.S. 
<br>policy in Iraq or EU policy on Cyprus have forced Erdogan 
<br>constantly to look over his shoulder and in turn to prove his 
<br>credentials by making statements inimical to good 
<br>U.S.-Turkish relations.  We expect Erdogan to carry out a 
<br>partial cabinet reshuffle early in 2005, but he will be 
<br>unable to remove the influence of Gul. 
<br> 
<br>¶21. (S) Third is corruption.  AKP swept to power by promising 
<br>to root out corruption.  However, in increasing numbers 
<br>AKPers from ministers on down, and people close to the party, 
<br>are telling us of conflicts of interest or serious corruption 
<br>in the party at the national, provincial and local level and 
<br>among close family members of ministers.  We have heard from 
<br>two contacts that Erdogan has eight accounts in Swiss banks; 
<br>his explanations that his wealth comes from the wedding 
<br>presents guests gave his son and that a Turkish businessman 
<br>is paying the educational expenses of all four Erdogan 
<br>children in the U.S. purely altruistically are lame. 
<br> 
<br>¶22. (S) Among the many figures mentioned to us as prominently 
<br>involved in corruption are Minister of Interior Aksu, 
<br>Minister of Foreign Trade Tuzmen, and AKP Istanbul provincial 
<br>chairman Muezzinoglu.  As we understand it from a contact in 
<br>the intel directorate of Turkish National Police, a 
<br>continuing investigation into Muezzinoglu's extortion racket 
<br>and other activities has already produced evidence 
<br>incriminating Erdogan.  In our contacts across Anatolia we 
<br>have detected no willingness yet at the grassroots level to 
<br>look closely at Erdogan or the party in this regard, but the 
<br>trend is a time bomb. 
<br> 
<br>¶23. (S) Fourth is the poor quality of Erdogan's and AKP's 
<br>appointments to the Turkish bureaucracy, at party 
<br>headquarters, and as party mayoral candidates.  A broad range 
<br>of senior career civil servants, including DefMin Gonul, 
<br>former Undersecretary of Customs Nevzat Saygilioglu, former 
<br>Forestry DirGen Abdurrahman Sagkaya, and many others, has 
<br>expressed shock and dismay to us at the incompetence, 
<br>prejudices and ignorance of appointees such as Omer Dincer, 
<br>an Islamist academic whom Erdogan appointed Undersecretary of 
<br>the Prime Ministry, THE key position in the government/state 
<br>bureaucracy.  Dincer is despised by the TGS.  Many 
<br>interlocutors also point to the weakness of Erdogan's deputy 
<br>party chairmen.  The result is that, unlike former leaders 
<br>such as Turgut Ozal or Suleyman Demirel, both of whom 
<br>appointed skilled figures who could speak authoritatively for 
<br>their bosses as their party general secretary and as 
<br>Undersecretary of the Prime Ministry, Erdogan has left 
<br>himself without people who can relieve him of the burden of 
<br>day-to-day management or who can ensure effective, productive 
<br>channels to the heart of the party and the heart of the 
<br>Turkish state. 
<br> 
<br>Two Big Questions 
<br>----------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶24. (C) Turkey's EU bid has brought forth reams of 
<br>pronouncements and articles -- Mustafa Akyol's 
<br>Gulenist-tinged "Thanksgiving for Turkey" in Dec. 27 Weekly 
<br>Standard is one of the latest -- attempting to portray Islam 
<br>in Turkey as distinctively moderate and tolerant with a 
<br>strong mystical (Sufi) underpinning.  Certainly, one can see 
<br>in Turkey's theology faculties some attempts to wrestle with 
<br>the problems of critical thinking, free will, and precedent 
<br>(ictihad), attempts which, compared to what goes on in 
<br>theology faculties in the Arab world, may appear relatively 
<br>progressive. 
<br> 
<br>¶25. (C) However, the broad, rubber-meets-the-road reality is 
<br>that Islam in Turkey is caught in a vise of (1) 100 years of 
<br>"secular" pressure to hide itself from public view, (2) 
<br>pressure and competition from brotherhoods and lodges to 
<br>follow their narrow, occult "true way", and (3) the faction- 
<br>and positivism-ridden aridity of the Religious Affairs 
<br>Directorate (Diyanet).  As a result, Islam as it is lived in 
<br>Turkey is stultified, riddled with hypocrisy, ignorant and 
<br>intolerant of other religions' presence in Turkey, and unable 
<br>to eject those who would politicize it in a radical, 
<br>anti-Western way.  Imams are for the most part poorly 
<br>educated and all too ready to insinuate anti-Western, 
<br>anti-Christian or anti-Jewish sentiments into their sermons. 
<br>Exceptionally few Muslims in Turkey have the courage to 
<br>challenge conventional Sunni thinking about jihad or, e.g., 
<br>verses in the Repentance shura of the Koran which have for so 
<br>long been used to justify violence against "infidels". 
<br> 
<br>¶26. (C) The problem is compounded by the willingness of 
<br>politicians such as Gul to play elusively with politicized 
<br>Islam.  Until Turkey ensures that the humanist strain in 
<br>Islam prevails here, Islam in Turkey will remain a troubled, 
<br>defensive force, hypocritical to an extreme degree and 
<br>unwilling to adapt to the challenges of open society. 
<br> 
<br>¶27. (C) A second question is the relation of Turkey and its 
<br>citizens to history -- the history of this land and citizens' 
<br>individual history.  Subject to rigid taboos, denial, fears, 
<br>and mandatory gross distortions, the study of history and 
<br>practice of historiography in the Republic of Turkey remind 
<br>one of an old Soviet academic joke: the faculty party chief 
<br>assembles his party cadres and, warning against various 
<br>ideological threats, proclaims, "The future is certain.  It's 
<br>only that damned past that keeps changing." 
<br> 
<br>¶28. (C) Until Turkey can reconcile itself to its past, 
<br>including the troubling aspects of its Ottoman past, in free 
<br>and open debate, how will Turkey reconcile itself to the 
<br>concept and practice of reconciliation in the EU?  How will 
<br>it have the self confidence to take decisions and formulate 
<br>policies responsive to U.S. interests?  Some in AKP are 
<br>joining what is still only a handful of others to take 
<br>tentative, but nonetheless inspiring, steps in this regard. 
<br>However, the road ahead will require a massive overhaul of 
<br>education, the introduction and acceptance of rule of law, 
<br>and a fundamental redefinition of the relation between 
<br>citizen and state.  In the words of the great (Alevi) 
<br>Anatolian bard Asik Veysel, this is a "long and delicate 
<br>road." 
<br> 
<br>¶29. (U) Baghdad minimize considered.
