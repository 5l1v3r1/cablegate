<br>
<br>Introduction: New Impetus to a Growing Relationship
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Mission Brazil warmly welcomes your visit to Brasilia. It
<br>is more than a courtesy to say that your trip comes at a
<br>significant time for U.S.-Brazil relations. A promising start with
<br>the new U.S. Administration is beginning to ebb as high-level
<br>initiatives have been delayed and Brazil has staked out positions
<br>at odds with USG views on such issues as Honduras,
<br>Colombia/Venezuela, Iran, non-proliferation, and the Middle East
<br>peace process. At the same time, as Brazil continues its rapid
<br>transformation from a regional to a global power, USG engagement
<br>with Brazil has continued to expand on a growing range of issues of
<br>importance to the United States, including global trade and
<br>finance, climate change, alternative fuels, regional energy
<br>integration, food security, UN Security Council matters, and
<br>trilateral cooperation in Haiti, Africa and elsewhere. The GOB
<br>remains eager to deepen bilateral engagement, and the possibilities
<br>to expand our productive economic engagement into other areas
<br>remain ample. As the Lula Government heads into its final year,
<br>your visit provides the opportunity to provide new impetus to the
<br>still-considerable positive momentum in our relationship, and to
<br>lay the groundwork for a more strategic partnership with a new
<br>Brazilian government.
<br>
<br>A Rapidly Emerging Global Power...
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) Brazil's status as one of the world's top-ten economies
<br>has received a boost over the past year from the continuation of
<br>solid economic management and better-than-expected performance
<br>through the global financial crisis and economic downturn.
<br>Brazil's growing economic clout and potential for an estimated 5%
<br>annual GDP growth during the next several years, combined with an
<br>aggressive effort by the Lula government to increase the country's
<br>international reach and the new prominence on the multilateral
<br>agenda of issues such as climate change on which Brazil is a
<br>necessary player, is encouraging this former global wallflower to
<br>make its presence felt on the world stage in ways that would have
<br>seemed unlikely only a decade ago.
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) Brazil's ascendancy is being driven by a strong and still
<br>strengthening democracy, a more open and stable economy, a
<br>competitive inward- and outward-looking private sector, a deepening
<br>S&T capability, and an ample natural resource base. Brazil is now
<br>the world's third largest agricultural exporter after the United
<br>States and the European Union and the second-largest issuer of ADRs
<br>on the New York Stock Exchange. Already a global leader in
<br>alternative fuels and self-sufficient in oil, recent discoveries of
<br>offshore (so-called "pre-salt") oil, while difficult to exploit,
<br>give Brazil the potential to become a major global oil producer and
<br>exporter over the next decade. Over the past two years, Brazil has
<br>played a critical role in shaping the international economic system
<br>through its participation in the Doha Round and its leadership in
<br>the G20. Brazil is making a transition from a recipient to a
<br>provider of assistance, mostly through technical cooperation.
<br>Brazil officially became an IMF "creditor" country this year and
<br>has pledged to increase its contribution to the IMF. (For
<br>additional background on Brazil's economy and economic positions,
<br>see the scenesetter for the bilateral Economic Policy Dialogue,
<br>reftel.)
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Under Lula, the GOB has dramatically increased its contacts
<br>with and presence in Africa, Asia (including North Korea), and the
<br>Middle East (especially Iran), opening some 48 posts abroad over
<br>the last seven years and increasing its diplomatic corps by 50%.
<br>While maintaining its focus on South American integration through
<br>MERCOSUL and UNASUL-institutions largely of its making--and
<br>preserving its longstanding multilateral encounters with the United
<br>States through the Summit of the Americas, with the EU through both
<br>regional and bilateral dialogues, and with Spain and Portugal
<br>through the Ibero-American Summit, Brazil has been the driving
<br>force behind a series of new multilateral gatherings, including the
<br>BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China), IBSA (India, Brazil, South
<br>Africa), ASSA (Southern Africa-South America), ASPA (South
<br>
<br>America-Arab Countries), and CALC (Summit of Latin America and the
<br>Caribbean). Brazil's top foreign policy priority remains obtaining
<br>a seat on the UN Security Council and, as it takes its place in
<br>January as a non-permanent UNSC member for the tenth time, it is
<br>aware that its actions will be closely watched.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Brazil has begun to take more visible and assertive
<br>positions on a broader range of issues of interest to the United
<br>States-sometimes helpfully, often not. Brazil's participation in
<br>the Doha Round, G20 talks, and, more recently, the preparations for
<br>the UNFCCC COP-15, has been serious and generally constructive.
<br>Unlike the other two giant emerging economies, China and India,
<br>Brazil is bringing to Copenhagen a goal to reduce its greenhouse
<br>gas emissions: a reduction of between 36-39% by 2020 compared with
<br>"business as usual," which translates to about a 25% decline
<br>compared with 2005. (The USG is proposing a 17% decline for 2020
<br>compared with 2005.) Brazil's own military and civilian nuclear
<br>programs have made it more difficult to work with on
<br>non-proliferation, and have led to the GOB's refusal to sign an
<br>Additional Protocol and lop-sided advocacy of Iran's rights to
<br>civilian nuclear technology. Even further from Brazil's historical
<br>interests, high-level exchanges of visits with Iran and
<br>increasingly intense engagement in the Middle East peace process
<br>are among recent high-profile forays into new areas of global
<br>import. Statements on North Korean missile tests, China's
<br>crackdown in Tibet, and elections in Zimbabwe are other instances
<br>where Brazil has stepped into new territory.
<br>
<br>...With the Emphasis on "Emerging"
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) If Brazil's rapid emergence on the global stage is
<br>unquestionable, it is also true that it is very much still
<br>emerging. Brazil's clear sense of purpose in South America, where
<br>the overriding importance of maintaining stability on its poorly
<br>protected borders has led to an emphasis on dialogue and
<br>integration with its ten neighbors, is not in evidence on most
<br>extra-regional issues. Brazil's objective in achieving a seat at
<br>the table on many global issues seems to stop at the seat itself.
<br>In part, this stems from a general Brazilian disposition to prefer
<br>dialogue with other countries to confrontation or isolation. It is
<br>also driven by Lula's determination to develop and maintain
<br>friendly relations with all global players as Brazil seeks a
<br>permanent seat on the UN Security Council. The end result is that
<br>Brazil often remains reticent to take firm positions on key global
<br>issues and generally seeks ways to avoid them. More often than
<br>not, the GOB eschews positions of leadership that might require
<br>overtly choosing sides. Its discomfort with the spotlight has been
<br>on full display in the aftermath of the Honduras coup: thrust into
<br>the center of the crisis when President Zelaya appeared on its
<br>embassy doorstep, Brazil did very little to extricate itself or to
<br>actively pursue a resolution, instead handing responsibility to the
<br>United States.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Less obviously, Brazil remains uncomfortable in its
<br>leadership on MINUSTAH. To the constant refrain of "we cannot
<br>continue this indefinitely," Brazil has been increasingly insistent
<br>that international efforts to promote security must go hand in hand
<br>with commitments to economic and social development-a theme it will
<br>take to the UNSC in January. Brazil maintains a frustrating
<br>double-standard on democracy and human rights. Although a founding
<br>member of the Community of Democracies and Partnership for
<br>Democratic Governance, Brazil rarely stands firm on these issues;
<br>even its stubbornly rigid support of Zelaya (more so than
<br>democracy) in Honduras stands in stark contrast to Lula's
<br>unquestioning acceptance of Iranian President Ahmadinejad's
<br>re-election. And in the wake of what it considered a
<br>near-disastrous brush with election observation in Zimbabwe last
<br>year, the GOB has opted to focus on technical cooperation related
<br>to running elections, in lieu of observing them. In the UN, Brazil
<br>generally chooses to abstain even on resolutions regarding the most
<br>egregious human rights abuses-such as those in Iran, North Korea,
<br>and Sudan-unless it considers evidence of non-cooperation with
<br>international human rights bodies to be clear-cut (as in Burma, for
<br>example).
<br>
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Where Brazil's policy is not hesitant, it is often
<br>ill-informed or straight-jacketed by the policies of the past. As
<br>it steps out on Middle East issues, the GOB does so with a lack of
<br>expertise on the region. Inclined to take assertions from the
<br>Syrians, Iranians, and Hizbullah at face value, it insists that
<br>peace can be achieved only if all players are at the table, and
<br>seeks to position itself as a neutral party, "the country who can
<br>talk to everyone," over against what it perceives as the biased
<br>U.S. and European efforts. This penchant for dialogue stands
<br>together with respect for sovereignty and non-intervention in
<br>internal affairs as the hallmarks of Brazilian foreign policy. But
<br>as Brazil plays in a growing number of international arenas, it is
<br>finding it more difficult to remain true to these principles, and
<br>more difficult to hide its inconsistencies.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Brazil's uneven foreign policy is mirrored by continued
<br>growing pains at home. Impressive strides over the last twenty
<br>years in establishing stable democratic institutions are tarnished
<br>by a dysfunctional judicial system, lack of enforcement capability,
<br>and persistent and widespread corruption. Even as Brazil's middle
<br>class continues to grow, the income gap remains significant and the
<br>country is still home to the largest number of poor in the
<br>hemisphere, with some 50 million concentrated in the northeast.
<br>Brazil's successful multinationals and vibrant entrepreneurial
<br>class are constrained by an inhospitable business climate, a costly
<br>and intrusive but inefficient government bureaucracy, R&D spending
<br>that focuses on producing articles for publications rather than
<br>innovation, and inadequate national transportation, communications,
<br>and energy infrastructure networks. Although it is heading to
<br>Copenhagen with an ambitious proposal to reduce greenhouse gas
<br>emissions and the lowest rates of deforestation on record, the GOB
<br>has made very little headway in straightening out the land
<br>ownership issues in the Amazon (where only about four percent of
<br>the land is clearly titled) or in providing sustainable economic
<br>activities for the more than 25 million people living in the
<br>region. Without resolving those issues, the pressure to clear the
<br>Amazon to support one's family will remain as great as ever.
<br>Though proud of its status as a "melting pot" in which different
<br>cultures and races exist side-by-side, racism remains a real and
<br>largely unacknowledged problem, and Brazil's indigenous population
<br>of some 700,000 individuals, scattered across the country in 225
<br>different societies, continues to suffer from prejudice, violence,
<br>and marginalization.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Nonetheless, Brazil continues to make progress across the
<br>board. Although the average Brazilian remains inward-looking and
<br>often ignorant of world developments, a burgeoning public interest
<br>in the United States has made Brazil one of the four largest
<br>visa-issuing and -adjudicating U.S. missions worldwide. Brazil
<br>continues to struggle with unresolved military dictatorship-era
<br>human rights violations, but is nonetheless moving successfully to
<br>reintegrate the military into the mainstream of national policy.
<br>Organized crime, urban murder rates often ten times those in the
<br>most violent U.S. cities, and the second largest consumption of
<br>cocaine in the world are in need of urgent attention, but Brazil's
<br>professional, well-trained Federal Police works as an effective
<br>partner with USG law enforcement agencies. Public education
<br>remains sub-standard, the Landless Movement (MST) continues to
<br>attract the rural disenfranchised, and the government is largely
<br>absent from the favelas of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and other
<br>major cities, whose millions of residents are often caught between
<br>criminal gangs and corrupt civil and military (uniformed) police.
<br>But Brazil has developed innovative social programs, and its Bolsa
<br>Familia conditional-transfer program is considered an international
<br>example.
<br>
<br>Relations with the United States: Can Brazil Overcome Its
<br>Inferiority Complex?
<br>
<br>¶11. (SBU) This Mission has been saying in its scenesetters that
<br>bilateral relations are as good as they have ever been-certainly in
<br>decades. This is true, and the evidence is ample: a burgeoning set
<br>of government-to-government dialogues covering economic,
<br>commercial, scientific, defense, and foreign policy has led to
<br>rapidly expanding cooperation: an MOU on biofuels cooperation,
<br>
<br>increased numbers of joint exercises between our militaries,
<br>trilateral cooperation in Africa and Haiti on such issues as
<br>health, food security, and institutional strengthening, and an
<br>innovative agreement to fight racial and ethnic discrimination.
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) At the same time, we face significant historical baggage in
<br>the way Brazil's foreign policy establishment views the United
<br>States, which slows our ability to build a fully cooperative
<br>relationship with Brazil. Much of Brazil's foreign policy
<br>establishment remains cautious and mistrustful toward the United
<br>States. Bilaterally, a growing and pragmatic interest in
<br>cooperating with the United States on a range of technical and
<br>practical issues is often caught up in fears that Brazil will lose
<br>sovereign control or will find itself a junior partner on its own
<br>soil to better funded, staffed, and organized USG partners. This
<br>has led to persistent problems with visas for U.S. law enforcement
<br>agencies (particularly, but not exclusively, on counterterrorism
<br>issues), refusal to accept USG assistance, and seemingly
<br>unreasonable demands and strictures on various types of
<br>cooperation. More concerted Mission efforts to reach out to
<br>non-traditional executive branch agencies and non-executive branch
<br>partners-state and municipal governments, the judiciary,
<br>prosecutors, legislators, the private sector, and civil
<br>society-have sometimes been greeted with concern, suspicion, and
<br>occasional opposition by a Foreign Ministry jealous of its
<br>historical lead on all international issues and self-designated
<br>role as both definer and protector of Brazil's national interests
<br>vis-C -vis the world.
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Within South America, Brazil sees the United States as a
<br>competitor and remains deeply suspicious of our motives and
<br>intentions. Although the notion that the United States harbors
<br>plans to invade or internationalize the Amazon or to seize Brazil's
<br>offshore oil may seem preposterous to Americans, concerns about
<br>such plans surface regularly among senior Brazilian officials,
<br>academics, and journalists, and are only the most outlandish
<br>manifestation of generalized mistrust and insecurity with regard to
<br>the United States presence in the region. Brazil's reaction to the
<br>U.S. base agreement with Colombia reflected, in large measure, just
<br>such concerns, as have its veiled efforts to scuttle the 3+1
<br>Security Dialogue with Paraguay and Argentina. The United States
<br>is not the only one subject to the Brazilian mistrust; The GOB now
<br>requires all NGOs operating in the Amazon region to be registered
<br>and has tightened controls related to land ownership by foreigners
<br>in the area.
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) Outside South America, Brazil's discomfort with the United
<br>States is less in evidence, but it is careful to avoid any
<br>suggestion that it is toeing a U.S. line, is intent on avoiding
<br>situations in which it might be perceived as a junior partner, and
<br>tends to see an "independent" position-i.e., independent of the
<br>United States in the first instance, and wealthy countries more
<br>generally-as the preferred default. Nor does Brazil want to be
<br>lumped in with the mass of developing countries. In multilateral
<br>settings, Brazil prefers to position itself as a "bridge" between
<br>the wealthy and developing nations. In cooperating with us in
<br>Africa, it has been careful to limit cooperation to those areas
<br>where it can act plausibly as an equal partner. Across the board,
<br>engagement with the United States has been pragmatic, rather than
<br>strategic. As it looks for strategic partners, Brazil is showing a
<br>clear preference for other "independent" emerging powers-South
<br>Africa, Turkey, Ukraine, Iran, China, India-and for one
<br>"independent" world power: France. This (long-standing) affinity
<br>for the French, which has been amply reciprocated by President
<br>Sarkozy and his government, has been most evident in the FX-2
<br>fighter competition, in which both Lula and Defense Minister Nelson
<br>Jobim have expressed a clear preference for the French aircraft
<br>despite Brazilian Air Force evaluations that show the clear
<br>superiority and cheaper price of the U.S. fighter.
<br>
<br>An Eager Brazil Gives Us the Opportunity to Invest for the
<br>Long-Term
<br>
<br>¶15. (SBU) In spite of their reticence, Brazilians continue to show
<br>a genuine interest in deepening relations with the United States.
<br>
<br>Economic issues are proving to be the easiest pathway to more
<br>productive engagement with the GOB, both because, as a large
<br>emerging economy, Brazil is beginning to have a natural seat at the
<br>table and because the GOB sees most easily how global economic
<br>issues directly impact its own well-being and national security.
<br>The GOB has shown itself a willing partner in efforts on bilateral
<br>investment and trade issues that will increase business
<br>opportunities, job growth, and economic development. At the same
<br>time, we are cooperating with Brazil to address the regulatory,
<br>legal and infrastructure challenges that constrain Brazil's growth
<br>and social inclusion goals and hurt U.S. exporters and investors.
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) We are also building these partnerships with the goal of
<br>promote regional and global economic and social inclusion
<br>goals--among them, addressing the global financial crisis, opening
<br>trade, and stimulating cooperation on economic development.
<br>Brazil's interest in taking on a mantle of global economic
<br>leadership offers numerous opportunities for engagement, as we
<br>encourage Brazil to take on increasingly responsible roles
<br>globally. As always, it is important to frame approaches to the GOB
<br>as a partner, and not a junior partner. However, constructive
<br>engagement in the G20 has given Brazil increased confidence that it
<br>can and should engage in issues outside its own borders, and the
<br>GOB takes deserved pride in having overcome many experiences
<br>(previous financial crises, addressing GINI inequalities,
<br>infrastructure impact on growth, etc) common to developing country,
<br>and sees itself as uniquely placed to use its "lessons learned" to
<br>help other developing countries tackle their own challenges. The
<br>GOB has been receptive to partnering with us on development
<br>cooperation, including a newly developing initiative in Mozambique
<br>and Haiti on agriculture, health and infrastructure development.
<br>We continue to work with Brazil to build consensus for WTO trade
<br>liberalization; to promote enhanced cooperation in fora such as
<br>OECD, WHO, and ICAO; and to create the conditions for global
<br>development and prosperity.
<br>
<br>¶17. (C) Our economic engagement provides a bridge to building our
<br>relationship with the GOB on other issues. Although they generally
<br>require more careful groundwork and legwork to ensure success, the
<br>possibilities to do so remain ample. In a country that seeks
<br>nothing so much as recognition of its "rightful" place on the
<br>international stage, there is widespread understanding that no
<br>other country can legitimize Brazil's aspirations in so meaningful
<br>a way as the United States. More immediately, the prospect for
<br>advancing beyond a pragmatic partnership received a significant
<br>boost with the election of President Obama. Although Brazilians
<br>generally admire the United States and maintain a strong interest
<br>in our culture and politics, from President Lula to the man on the
<br>street they see in the President a kindred spirit whom they are
<br>eager to engage. The Administration's early statements and actions
<br>with regard to Latin America-the President's meeting with UNASUL
<br>and efforts to reach out at the Summit of the Americas, the spirit
<br>of negotiation at the OAS General Assembly, efforts to reinitiate
<br>dialogue with Cuba, Venezuela, and Bolivia-were all well received
<br>in Brazil, and heightened expectations of an even closer
<br>relationship. Brazilian officials were impressed by what they
<br>heard from General Jones, Under Secretary Tauscher, and other
<br>senior officials during their visit in August.
<br>
<br>¶18. (C) In the intervening months, both official and non-official
<br>Brazilians have become increasingly disappointed with what they
<br>perceive as a lack of attention from the United States. While
<br>acknowledging that the United States has pressing domestic and
<br>international priorities, Brazilians feel more than ever that their
<br>successes-their performance through the financial crisis,
<br>constructive engagement in the WTO and Copenhagen, creative social
<br>programs, and even their successful bids for the 2014 World Cup and
<br>the 2016 Summer Olympics-have earned them a more prominent place on
<br>the U.S. agenda. With regard to the GOB in particular, the
<br>Colombia bases problem seemed to be evidence of a lack on the part
<br>of the USG both of transparency in our dealings in the region and
<br>of consideration regarding matters that have a direct impact on
<br>Brazil's security. Although initially pleased with the USG
<br>response to the coup in Honduras, and despite having publicly
<br>insisted the problem was ours to resolve, the GOB saw our position
<br>
<br>in support of Honduran democratic process (rather than a firm
<br>insistence on Zelaya's restoration) as a step away from
<br>consensus-building in the region.
<br>
<br>¶19. (C) Despite this frustration, the GOB remains eager to engage,
<br>and holds out continued hope that Brazil will receive a visit from
<br>President Obama in the coming months. The Foreign Ministry is in
<br>the process of creating and increasing staffing for a higher level
<br>department (equivalent to a Department of State bureau) to handle
<br>United States, Canada, and Inter-American Affairs.
<br>Uncharacteristically, the Foreign Ministry has extended a series of
<br>new offers and taken up others it has long delayed: it is eager to
<br>launch the proposed high-level dialogue, has sought to replicate
<br>the success of the Joint Action Plan to Fight Racial Discrimination
<br>by proposing an MOU on gender issues, is moving forward on a
<br>Defense Cooperation Agreement, Pol-Mil talks, trilateral
<br>cooperation in Haiti and Africa, and a Tropical Forest Conservation
<br>Act agreement, has offered an MOU on climate change, and has
<br>expressed repeated interest in establishing joint counternarcotics
<br>cooperation with Bolivia. While getting to yes on these
<br>initiatives will undoubtedly require the same patience and care to
<br>avoid Brazilian sensitivities that mark almost all of our daily
<br>interactions with the GOB, the evident interest at senior levels of
<br>the presidency and foreign ministry in building up the relationship
<br>should help smooth the way over the next months.
<br>
<br>¶20. (C) As keen as they are to cultivate the Obama Administration,
<br>GOB officials are also driven by the knowledge that their timeframe
<br>for making meaningful progress is short. There is little more than
<br>a year left of the Lula government; only ten months until elections
<br>for president, all 27 governors, two-thirds of the senate, and all
<br>federal and state deputies; just over six months before official
<br>campaigning begins; and less than four months until ministers who
<br>intend to run for office-perhaps as many as half of Lula's
<br>cabinet-must resign. This election-year calendar will be further
<br>complicated by the traditional slowdown during Brazil's extended
<br>summer/Christmas/Carnival break. Nonetheless, the continuity
<br>provided by Brazil's influential diplomatic corps and the
<br>likelihood of broad continuity on both foreign and domestic policy
<br>under either of the two strongest contenders to succeed Lula on
<br>January 1, 2011 means that initiatives put into place now will lay
<br>the groundwork for the new Brazilian government.
<br>
<br>¶21. (C) The GOB will be looking for signs in your visit that USG
<br>interest in engaging Brazil as a global partner has not waned.
<br>While GOB officials are unlikely to give on the issues that have
<br>proved contentious over the last months, they will value the
<br>opportunity to explain their views, will want to hear the
<br>Administration's perspective and aspirations with regard to Brazil,
<br>and will seriously entertain suggestions for additional engagement.
<br>Your visit provides the opportunity to forge a durable working
<br>relationship over the next year and to lay the foundation for a
<br>strategic bilateral relationship with the next Brazilian government
<br>that will also be essential to influencing the direction of
<br>Brazil's development as a maturing global actor.
