<br>SUBJECT: FM LAVROV DISCUSSES MISSILE DEFENSE AND IRAN WITH 
<br>CODEL LEVIN 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Ambassador John R. Beyrle for reasons 1.4(b) and (d) 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (S) Summary.  Foreign Minister Lavrov told visiting Codel 
<br>Levin April 15 that arms control issues were Russia's top 
<br>priority.  Noting that Moscow was waiting for concrete 
<br>proposals, including specific language, from the U.S. on a 
<br>post-START treaty agreement, Lavrov said he recognized that 
<br>the U.S. would not want to address the link between offensive 
<br>and defensive weapons in the post-START negotiations, but it 
<br>would be important to have such a dialogue in the future. 
<br>Russia was interested in developing a joint missile defense 
<br>system (MD) with the U.S., but we should start "from 
<br>scratch," with joint threat assessments, determination of 
<br>necessary resources, and best location for MD assets.  Lavrov 
<br>rejected a quid pro quo in which the U.S. would discontinue 
<br>its MD plans for eastern Europe in exchange for Russia 
<br>pressuring Iran to end its nuclear weapons program, 
<br>emphasizing that each issue should be considered separately. 
<br>He acknowledged that Moscow was concerned about Iran's 
<br>longer-range missile development and said Russia would be 
<br>prepared to undertake a "dual-track" approach towards Iran's 
<br>nuclear program; offering incentives to Tehran, but keeping 
<br>in reserve measures within the Agreed Framework.  He 
<br>reconfirmed that Moscow had suspended the sale of S-300's to 
<br>Iran "for the moment."  In a follow-on meeting, DFM Sergey 
<br>Ryabkov stressed that while Russia was interested in working 
<br>with the U.S. on MD, it would be difficult for Russia to join 
<br>a U.S. MD effort that included sites in Poland and the Czech 
<br>Republic, and urged that if the U.S. intended to pursue sites 
<br>in Europe, they should be further west and south, so as to 
<br>diminish the effect on Russian capabilities.  Ryabkov 
<br>emphasized that "no one can deliver Iran to the U.S., except 
<br>the U.S. itself," and argued that, while the S-300 sale was 
<br>"frozen," the "less Moscow heard from Washington about it, 
<br>the better."  End summary. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) In a meeting with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in 
<br>Moscow April 15, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services 
<br>Committee, Carl Levin (D-MI), together with SASC members Bill 
<br>Nelson (D-FL) and Susan Collins (R-ME) emphasized that they 
<br>were united in their hope that the U.S. and Russia could 
<br>strengthen their cooperation to address common challenges. 
<br>Noting the Senate's Constitutional role in ratifying treaties 
<br>and providing advice and recommendations on foreign policy 
<br>issues to the President, Senator Levin raised missile defense 
<br>(MD) as an issue that had divided the two countries, but 
<br>should unite them.  He suggested that if Russia and the U.S, 
<br>could work together on MD, it would send a powerful message 
<br>to those who might threaten us, including to Iran. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) FM Lavrov welcomed the Senators' visit, and noted that 
<br>it was timely, coming two weeks after the first meeting 
<br>between Presidents Obama and Medvedev.  He highlighted the 
<br>important role "Parliaments" play in building constructive 
<br>relationships and expressed the hope that the U.S. and Russia 
<br>could overcome the "inertia" that had characterized the 
<br>relationship in the past. 
<br> 
<br>Arms Control, NPT 
<br>----------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) Lavrov said that arms control issues were Russia's top 
<br>priority.  The U.S.-Russia agenda was positive, even though 
<br>we had differences.  Moscow hoped the U.S. Administration 
<br>would submit the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty for 
<br>ratification, and would reconsider sending the "123" 
<br>Agreement to the Hill.  He welcomed President Obama's remarks 
<br>supporting nuclear weapons reductions, saying that such 
<br>reductions were not just a matter of security for the U.S. 
<br>and Russia, but carried a political message that would be 
<br>important for the 2010 review of the Non-Proliferation Treaty 
<br>(NPT).  While characterizing the elimination of nuclear 
<br>weapons as "a noble goal," Lavrov said it was not "an 
<br>immediate project."  We needed to have some clear proposals, 
<br>which would give others a clear idea of the way forward.  He 
<br>suggested that the next stage after the post-START 
<br>negotiations should consider how to engage others, such as 
<br>the UK, in discussions of further reductions, as well as 
<br>looking at tactical nuclear weapons. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) There was "a lot to do" on non-proliferation issues, 
<br>Lavrov said, including Iran and North Korea.  Pakistan was a 
<br>concern, and we should think about engaging them as well as 
<br>India and Israel.  The U.S. and Russia had cooperated to 
<br> 
<br>MOSCOW 00001111  002 OF 005 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>address the danger of non-state actors acquiring nuclear 
<br>material though programs such as the Global Initiative to 
<br>Combat Nuclear Terrorism and UN Security Council Resolution 
<br>¶1540.  The U.S. and Russia should also look at ways to 
<br>strengthen the NPT regime, including how to universalize the 
<br>Additional Protocol.  We should also work on issues like fuel 
<br>supply, the Nuclear Fuel Center Russia had started, and 
<br>programs like the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership. 
<br> 
<br>Post-START 
<br>---------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) Lavrov expressed appreciation for the Senate's 
<br>confirmation of Rose Gottemoeller as A/S for VCI, noting that 
<br>the U.S. and Russia had a lot of work to do to achieve a 
<br>follow-on agreement to the START Treaty.  The issue would be 
<br>discussed at the meeting between DVBR Director Anatoliy 
<br>Antonov and A/S Gottemoeller in Rome on April 24, as well as 
<br>in his meeting with the Secretary in Washington in May.  The 
<br>teams would report to the Presidents in July, and hope to 
<br>reach a framework agreement by the end of the year.  He said 
<br>that while the Presidents in their statement April 1 had 
<br>endorsed reductions below the Moscow Treaty limits and had 
<br>agreed to use many of the verification procedures of the 
<br>START Treaty, Moscow was waiting for more concrete proposals 
<br>from the U.S., including specific language. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) Lavrov highlighted the April 1 Joint Statement's 
<br>reference to the link between offensive and defensive 
<br>weapons, saying that the balance between the two that had 
<br>existed in the Soviet Union had been thrown off kilter when 
<br>the U.S. withdrew from the ABM Treaty.  He stressed that he 
<br>recognized this did not mean the U.S. would support 
<br>addressing the linkage during the post-START negotiations, 
<br>but it was important to have a discussion on it at some point 
<br>in the future. 
<br> 
<br>Missile Defense and Iran 
<br>------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (C) Senator Levin said the SASC was interested in 
<br>exploring the possibility of U.S. and Russia working together 
<br>on MD.  The U.S. was focused on the threat from Iran, but he 
<br>recognized that Russia may have a broader perspective. 
<br>However, we were both opposed to a nuclear-armed Iran, which 
<br>would be able to put pressure on other countries in the 
<br>region.  The U.S. also perceived the possibility of an 
<br>Iranian long-range missile as a threat.  He noted that press 
<br>reports indicated that Medvedev had told Henry Kissinger and 
<br>the Hart-Hagel Commission that he was concerned that the 
<br>Iranian nuclear program was more of a threat than Russia had 
<br>previously believed.  (Lavrov emphatically corrected this, 
<br>saying Medvedev had expressed concern about Iran's missile 
<br>launch).  Noting that the U.S. had made commitments to Poland 
<br>and the Czech Republic, Senator Levin said the U.S. would 
<br>need to consider how to keep those commitments and include 
<br>Europe in a common MD program with Russia. 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C) Agreeing that MD should unite the U.S. and Russia, 
<br>rather than divide us, Lavrov said Russia was interested in 
<br>developing a MD system with the U.S., but the U.S. proposals 
<br>for an MD system in Poland and the Czech Republic ("3rd 
<br>Site"), disrupted the balance between the U.S. and Russia's 
<br>nuclear potential.  He stressed that then-President Putin's 
<br>Kennebunkport proposal for a cooperative MD effort using 
<br>Russian resources, joint analyses and determinations of the 
<br>threat, and data exchange centers, was still on the table. 
<br>He welcomed President Obama's statement that if the Iran 
<br>nuclear issue were resolved satisfactorily, there would be 
<br>less need for the 3rd Site, but took care to emphasize that 
<br>Russia did not support a quid pro quo between Russia helping 
<br>to get Iran to end its nuclear weapons program and the U.S. 
<br>discontinuing its deployment in eastern Europe.  These two 
<br>issues should be dealt with separately, on their own merits, 
<br>Lavrov stressed. 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (C) Noting that the Congressional Budget Office had 
<br>presented three alternatives on the MD project, Lavrov said 
<br>this showed there were issues with the proposal.  Hastening 
<br>to add that Russia did not endorse any of the three 
<br>alternatives, Lavrov commended the Administration's intent to 
<br>review them, noting this was the difference with the new 
<br>Administration: it was willing to listen and take the time to 
<br>analyze the alternatives, instead of saying "this is what 
<br> 
<br>MOSCOW 00001111  003 OF 005 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>must be done; everyone must say yes sir." 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (C) In response to Senator's Levin question why Russia 
<br>was not more concerned about Iran's missile capabilities, 
<br>since Russia was closer to Iran, Lavrov said Moscow was "not 
<br>complacent; we are closer."  But whenever Russian negotiators 
<br>had protested to the U.S. side that the proposed radar could 
<br>cover Russia up to the Urals and the interceptors could reach 
<br>Russian territory, the U.S. response had simply been that the 
<br>system "was not aimed at Russia."  As Medvedev and Putin had 
<br>said, "when there is something risky on the ground, you need 
<br>to take it into account."  Russia had warned it would need to 
<br>take countermeasures if the 3rd site was deployed, and that 
<br>it would put missiles in Kaliningrad.  Noting that Moscow 
<br>would announce soon just how much it had withdrawn from 
<br>Kaliningrad, Lavrov said he hoped the U.S. and Russia could 
<br>find common ground on MD. 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (C) Lavrov cautioned that Russia did not perceive Iran in 
<br>the same way as the U.S.  Iran for Russia was "much more than 
<br>a country which might cause concern in the international 
<br>community."  Russia opposed Iran getting a nuclear weapon, 
<br>because Russia did not want any more "members of the nuclear 
<br>club," but Iran and Russia were historical and traditional 
<br>partners and neighbors, with a "rich bilateral agenda." 
<br>Lavrov said he was certain Iran wanted to have a full nuclear 
<br>fuel cycle and would negotiate from that basis.  It was 
<br>unfortunate that the U.S. had not accepted the proposals a 
<br>few years before when Iran only had 32 centrifuges; now they 
<br>had over 5,000.  Nonetheless, Russia wanted Iran to cooperate 
<br>fully with the IAEA and implement, and eventually ratify, the 
<br>Additional Protocol.  As agreed to in the E3-plus-3 
<br>statement, Russia wanted Iran to prove the peaceful nature of 
<br>its nuclear program, in a verifiable way. 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (C) Lavrov commended the new U.S. approach to Iran, 
<br>welcoming President Obama's readiness for the U.S. to engage 
<br>"fully" in talks with Iran.  Willingness to discuss "all" the 
<br>issues was a welcome step, and one which Russia had been 
<br>advocating for several years, Lavrov said.  Iran wielded a 
<br>lot of influence in the region, including on Afghanistan, 
<br>Iraq, Hizbollah, Hamas, Gaza, etc.  Iran had long been 
<br>concerned about Israel, and saw Pakistan as a nuclear-weapons 
<br>competitor.  Putin had asked Ahmadinejad during a meeting in 
<br>Tehran a few years before why he made such anti-Israeli 
<br>statements, but Ahmadinejad had not responded, only saying 
<br>that Iran was "not doing anything in the nuclear sphere 
<br>different from Brazil."  Putin had replied that Brazil was 
<br>not in the Middle East.  While Iran wanted to dominate the 
<br>region and the Islamic world, which was of concern to Arab 
<br>governments, the U.S. should realize that the "Arab Street" 
<br>considers Iranian leaders to be heroes. 
<br> 
<br>¶14. (C) Noting that Russia was watching events in Iran 
<br>closely, Lavrov said Moscow would be prepared to undertake 
<br>the "dual-track approach," first offering incentives to Iran, 
<br>but keeping in reserve measures within the Agreed Framework. 
<br>The Administration's new approach "give us a much better 
<br>chance than we had in the past.  We will do everything we can 
<br>to make it work," Lavrov said. 
<br> 
<br>¶15. (C) Senator Nelson said he was encouraged by the FM's 
<br>remarks, noting that it might be possible to consider 
<br>cooperating on use of Russia's radars at Gabala and Armavir. 
<br>He said he hoped Lavrov was right that Iran would be deterred 
<br>from building a nuclear weapon, but he was skeptical.  The 
<br>best deterrence might be for the U.S. and Russia to cooperate 
<br>on MD. 
<br> 
<br>S-300 Sales 
<br>----------- 
<br> 
<br>¶16. (S) Senator Levin said that Russia had taken a practical 
<br>and pragmatic step with the suspension of the sale of S-300 
<br>missiles to Iran, Senator Levin said.  This helped make 
<br>Israel less nervous, and sent a message to Iran that the U.S. 
<br>and Russia were working more closely together on Iran issues. 
<br> Lavrov acknowledged that Russia was not supplying the system 
<br>"for the moment," but reiterated the usual mantra that 
<br>Russia's S-300 contract with Iran did not violate any 
<br>international or national laws or arms control regimes, and 
<br>that the S-300's were a defensive system only.  He added that 
<br>nothing Russia had sold Iran had been used against anyone, 
<br>whereas U.S. weapons provided to Georgia had been used 
<br> 
<br>MOSCOW 00001111  004 OF 005 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>against Russian soldiers.  This did not mean the U.S. did not 
<br>have the right to sell weapons to Georgia, but Moscow did not 
<br>want a repeat of the August 2008 conflict.  Overall, he said, 
<br>the Iranians had legitimate security concerns.  They had been 
<br>attacked more than once by their neighbors, and saw 
<br>Pakistan's nuclear status as "competition for regional 
<br>leadership." 
<br> 
<br>¶17. (S) In a follow-on meeting with DFM Ryabkov, Senator 
<br>Levin asked whether Iran believed the S-300 sale was canceled 
<br>or just suspended.  Ryabkov replied that a contract existed, 
<br>and it was impossible to break a contract without 
<br>consequences.  He repeated that Moscow had taken U.S. and 
<br>Israeli concerns into account, and at present Russia was not 
<br>providing any components of the system to Teheran.  Thus, it 
<br>was "obvious the degree to which Iran was dissatisfied with 
<br>this," he said.  But, the contract was not canceled, it was 
<br>merely "frozen," Ryabkov stressed.  He argued that "the less 
<br>we hear from Washington about this, the better." 
<br> 
<br>Afghanistan/Pakistan 
<br>-------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶18. (C) Senator Collins expressed appreciation for Russia's 
<br>allowing transit of non-lethal equipment to ISAF in 
<br>Afghanistan, and asked how the U.S. and Russia could work 
<br>together to counter terrorism in Afghanistan and Pakistan. 
<br>Lavrov said Pakistan was a place were "a lot of problems 
<br>start for Afghanistan," and questioned the term "moderate 
<br>Taliban."  He said the people on the UNSCR 1267 Committee 
<br>list should be "blacklisted for as long as possible," but for 
<br>anyone else, as long as they renounced terrorism, cooperated 
<br>with the Kabul government, and refrained from extremist 
<br>activity, it would be all right to deal with them. 
<br> 
<br>Ryabkov Meeting 
<br>--------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶19. (C) In a follow-up meeting with DFM Ryabkov immediately 
<br>afterwards, Ryabkov cited the non-paper Lavrov had given the 
<br>Secretary in the Hague on March 31, and said there was 
<br>already a good basis to cooperate with the U.S. on MD. 
<br>Progress had been made in the NATO Russia Council on theater 
<br>missile defense, and Moscow believed there was more that 
<br>could be done there.  But he reiterated Lavrov's position 
<br>that bilateral discussions would need to start from scratch. 
<br>He disagreed with Senator Levin's statement that the system 
<br>could not have a significant impact on Russia's nuclear 
<br>capabilities.  He noted that Russia was more concerned about 
<br>the radar than the interceptor sites, because the former 
<br>could see the location of Russia's strategic forces, but even 
<br>with the interceptors, nobody could predict what would be at 
<br>those sites in 10 years' time.  In response to Senator's 
<br>Levin's asking whether the deployments couldn't be limited by 
<br>an agreement, Ryabkov acknowledged that was a possibility, 
<br>but stressed that the radar could still be used with other 
<br>U.S. MD assets.  The sites in Poland and the Czech Republic 
<br>were part of a global MD architecture, which, when linked 
<br>together, could almost "knock Russia out." 
<br> 
<br>¶20. (C) Ryabkov stressed that while the U.S. and Russia were 
<br>not adversaries now, "intentions could change," whereas 
<br>"capabilities" were much harder to change.  He noted that the 
<br>countries in eastern Europe saw the 3rd site as more of a 
<br>geo-political issue, bringing them closer to the West, than 
<br>as a response to a potential threat from Iran.  "We are not 
<br>in a zero-sum game and we do not want to use your possibly 
<br>legitimate security concern as a geo-political pawn," Ryabkov 
<br>argued.  Noting a link to the post-START negotiations, 
<br>Ryabkov said the greater the reductions in number of warheads 
<br>each side could possess, the more strategically important MD 
<br>became.  He added that it would be politically difficult for 
<br>Russia to join a U.S. MD effort that included sites in Poland 
<br>and the Czech Republic.  If the U.S. intended to pursue sites 
<br>in Europe, they should be further west and south, so as to 
<br>diminish the effect on Russian capabilities. 
<br> 
<br>¶21. (C) In response to Senator Levin's question whether it 
<br>would be possible to develop a joint radar system with 
<br>Russian radars at Gabala, Armavir, and Moscow, connected to 
<br>U.S. AEGIS and THAAD systems, Ryabkov responded that he had 
<br>not considered such an idea before and would need to think 
<br>about it.  Such a system, he noted, would become strategic, 
<br>and would lack the X-band capability of the radar proposed 
<br> 
<br>MOSCOW 00001111  005 OF 005 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>for the Czech Republic, since all the systems cited were 
<br>early-warning radars only, but it could be an option. 
<br> 
<br>¶22. (C) Ryabkov said Russia hoped it would be possible to 
<br>have a "meaningful dialogue" with Iran, and noted that 
<br>President Obama's remarks had had a strong impact in Teheran 
<br>and the Arab world.  But it was still difficult to predict 
<br>how Teheran would react.  He characterized the P5-plus 1 
<br>(E3-plus-3) statement as "very promising," but claimed 
<br>experience showed Iran would not make concessions under 
<br>pressure.  He emphasized that it was "very clear that no one 
<br>can deliver Iran to the U.S., except the U.S. itself." 
<br> 
<br>Civilian Space Cooperation 
<br>-------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶23. (C) In response to Senator Nelson's question about 
<br>prospects for increased civilian space cooperation and what 
<br>would happen when the U.S. was fully dependent on the Soyuz 
<br>spacecraft to reach the International Space Station, Ryabkov 
<br>said he saw no difficulty with meeting the U.S.'s needs, and 
<br>said we should both be forward-leaning.  He noted that 
<br>RosCosmos had suggested to NASA that Russia cooperate on 
<br>development of the U.S.'s new spacecraft, but the idea had 
<br>not been pursued.  Ryabkov proposed we discuss the issue 
<br>further with RosCosmos and said Moscow favored closer 
<br>cooperation with the U.S. and Europe in this area.  While it 
<br>was not linked to MD, the more progress we could make on MD, 
<br>the better able we would be to move forward on other issues. 
<br> 
<br>¶24. (U) Codel Levin did not clear this cable.
