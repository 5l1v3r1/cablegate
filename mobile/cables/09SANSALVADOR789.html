<br>SUBJECT: FRIENDS OF MAURICIO: FUNES NEEDS YOUR HELP  
<br>  
<br>Classified By: Charge d'Affaires, for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  
<br>  
<br>¶1. (S) Summary: Leaders of the Friends of Mauricio movement,  
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX, told us  
<br>August 21 the movement is formalizing itself and changing its  
<br>name to the Citizen Movement for Change.  They said Funes is  
<br>concerned about his personal security, physical security at  
<br>the Presidential offices, and suspects hard-line FMLN  
<br>elements are intercepting Funes' and his inner circle's  
<br>telephone calls.  XXXXXXXXXXXX expressed disappointment in the  
<br>performance of intelligence service chief Eduardo Linares and  
<br>described the decision making process that led to Manuel  
<br>Melgar being named Minister for Public Security and Justice  
<br>(in lieu of FMLN hard-liner Jose Luis Merino.)  End Summary.  
<br>  
<br>¶2. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX, told Charge and Emboffs  
<br>August 21 that the Friends of Mauricio movement was moving to  
<br>formalize its status and had just selected Funes himself as  
<br>the President of the (now renamed) Citizen Movement for  
<br>Change.  XXXXXXXXXXXX said there were no immediate plans to convert  
<br>the Citizen Movement for Change into a political party but  
<br>did not rule out that possibility.  He said the near-term  
<br>goal of the organization was to accompany President Funes as  
<br>he governed and to provide him non-FMLN political support  
<br>during his term.  He said the Friends of Mauricio  
<br>organization in the U.S. would likely move to formalize its  
<br>status, too.  
<br>  
<br>¶3. (S) XXXXXXXXXXXX said Funes and those in his inner circle were  
<br>concerned about both his personal security as well as  
<br>technical security of their communications.  XXXXXXXXXXXX also  
<br>lamented the state of physical security around Casa  
<br>Presidencial, the presidential office compound.  XXXXXXXXXXXX said he  
<br>suspected elements in the (left-wing) FMLN were monitoring  
<br>phone calls of the President, XXXXXXXXXXXX, and other non-FMLN  
<br>members of the Government.  XXXXXXXXXXXX said Funes would welcome  
<br>U.S. assistance in both areas.  Charge offered to arrange a  
<br>meeting with Funes and appropriate Embassy staff; XXXXXXXXXXXX  
<br>  
<br>¶4. (S) XXXXXXXXXXXX said he and the President were disappointed in  
<br>the new Director of the Salvadoran State Intelligence  
<br>Organization (OIE), Eduardo Linares (aka Douglas Santamaria).  
<br> Despite high hopes initially, XXXXXXXXXXXX said almost three  
<br>months into the Funes administration, he was still not  
<br>receiving daily briefings from OIE.  He recounted other  
<br>instances where he felt Funes was ill-served by the OIE under  
<br>Linares, including the surprise arrival of substantial  
<br>numbers of protesters at Casa Presidencial, complete with  
<br>portable toilets, with no advance warning.  In another case,  
<br>in the days following Zelaya's expulsion from Honduras,  
<br>Venezuela FM Maduro arrived in a BRV plane in San Salvador,  
<br>met with senior, hard-line elements of the FMLN, and OIE  
<br>never reported this XXXXXXXXXXXX.  (Note: XXXXXXXXXXXX  
<br>learned of the visit from a confidante at the airport.)  
<br>  
<br>¶5. (S) XXXXXXXXXXXX also expressed hope that the USG would be able  
<br>to provide assistance for blocking mobile phone transmissions  
<br>from Salvadoran prisons; Charge pointed out that assistance  
<br>would be available, too, but through different channels, much  
<br>of it part of Plan Merida.  However, he said, the  
<br>complicating factor remained Minister of Public Security and  
<br>Justice Manuel Melgar.  Charge said we expect to receive  
<br>shortly instructions to meet with Funes on the subject.  
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX said Melgar's appointment was not taken to display  
<br>any disrespect to the U.S., but had been a compromise with  
<br>the FMLN, which had sought appointment of FMLN hard-liner  
<br>Jose Luis Merino (aka Ramiro Vasquez) as Public Security  
<br>Minister.  
<br>  
<br>¶6. (S) Funes, he said, had pushed back and preferred to name  
<br>Melgar to that position because he had developed a certain  
<br>rapport with Melgar during the campaign.  XXXXXXXXXXXX described  
<br>Melgar's behavior around Funes during the campaign as  
<br>compliant and loyal to Funes, characteristics he said would  
<br>not have been the case with Merino.  XXXXXXXXXXXX said Funes would  
<br>consider new information on Melgar and take appropriate  
<br>action, fully cognizant of Melgar's linkage to the 1985 Zona  
<br>Rosa killings.  
<br>  
<br>¶7. (S) Comment: The message from XXXXXXXXXXXX on behalf  
<br>of Funes was clear: we have great confidence in the USG, real  
<br>security concerns, and need your help.  XXXXXXXXXXXX  
<br>  
<br>¶8. (S) Comment continued: The stress of the bifurcated  
<br>Funes/FMLN relationship continues to manifest itself in the  
<br>GOES.  While mediocre performance by two FMLN members in key  
<br>positions may provide Funes the pretext for a cabinet  
<br>shuffle, it does not guarantee the FMLN will  
<br>take their  
<br>removal lying down.  FMLN leaders are  
<br>likely to demand that  
<br>their quota of positions in the GOES remain stable, and have  
<br>shown their ability to be disruptive when they don't get  
<br>their way.
