<br>
<br>¶3.  (C) Summary:  During a bilateral meeting on the margins
<br>of the Progressive Governance Leaders Summit in Chile, Vice
<br>President Joseph Biden and British Prime Minister Gordon
<br>Brown discussed the economic crisis in terms of the upcoming
<br>G-20 Summit and Afghanistan and Pakistan.  On economic
<br>issues, Brown pressed Vice President Biden to push the
<br>Germans to move forward with $250 billion in special drawing
<br>rights (SDRs) for the IMF, to use IMF gold sales to support
<br>poorest countries and to take the initiative to restart
<br>sectoral negotiations related to Doha.  On Pakistan and
<br>Afghanistan, Vice President Biden noted our increased troop
<br>commitment to Afghanistan and the need to lower expectations
<br>as to what is achievable in Afghanistan given enormous
<br>governance issues.  End Summary.
<br>
<br>-------------------------
<br>TRADE AND ECONOMIC ISSUES
<br>-------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4.  (C) PM Brown opened the meeting by thanking Vice
<br>President Biden for recent statement on revising the
<br>supervisory structure for the G-20.
<br>
<br>¶5.  (C) Vice President Biden asked whether capital flight
<br>from developing countries would be high on the G-20 agenda
<br>and noted that Argentinean President Fernandez has requested
<br>additional assistance without the usual IMF conditionality.
<br>Brown responded that he was worried about capital flight,
<br>particularly in Eastern Europe.  The current financial crisis
<br>will test whether Eastern European nations have developed
<br>sufficiently strong institutions since the fall of communism
<br>to withstand the downturn politically and socially as well as
<br>economically.  It is a test of whether freedom can be
<br>successfully combined with economic stability.  IMF
<br>conditionality has long been an area of contention for Latin
<br>America and it is not surprising that Argentina would ask for
<br>preventative funds without conditions.
<br>
<br>------------------------------
<br>BROWN PRESSES ON IMF AND TRADE
<br>------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶6.  (C) Prime Minister Brown delivered several requests on
<br>economic issues to Vice President Biden.  The first was the
<br>need to secure financing for an additional $250 billion in
<br>Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) for the IMF to help vulnerable
<br>economies withstand the economic downturn.  Brown commented
<br>that his understanding was this was an amount that the
<br>administration could support without the need to consult
<br>Congress.  U.S. support on the issue would be particularly
<br>helpful with the Germans who, as yet, do not support
<br>additional SDRs.  Parallel discussions were going on with
<br>China, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and several other Gulf nations to
<br>secure $400 billion in additional financing.  Rapid approval
<br>of the IMF portion would help catalyze these parallel
<br>negotiations.
<br>
<br>¶7.  (C) PM Brown also noted that the IMF was being forced to
<br>sell gold to raise funds to pay its administrative staff.
<br>There had been far fewer loan programs this decade than in
<br>the 1990s.  The result was reduced revenue from countries
<br>repaying loans and a consequent budget shortfall.  There is a
<br>
<br>SANTIAGO 00000324  002.2 OF 003
<br>
<br>pending sale of $11 billion in IMF gold that should be used
<br>to help the poorest countries rather than pay IMF staff.  The
<br>U.S. position had been that interest from gold reserves could
<br>be devoted to IMF programs, but that capital sales should
<br>not.  PM Brown asked Vice President Biden to reconsider this
<br>position.
<br>
<br>¶8.  (C) PM Brown said successfully concluding the Doha round
<br>would be difficult but the Obama administration should agree
<br>to deal with environmental and labor commitments outside the
<br>formal trading framework in relevant institutions such as the
<br>ILO.  Brown suggested that if the United States allowed
<br>resumption of the next round of sectoral discussions, it
<br>would create momentum for the rest of the world, including
<br>India, to re-engage in the discussions.  Opening new sectoral
<br>discussions on Doha would garner the Administration
<br>international support without needing to make difficult
<br>political compromises or commitments for the time being.
<br>
<br>¶9.  (C) UK Secretary of State for International Development
<br>Douglas Alexander said it was important to find a way to move
<br>forward on the Doha Agreement.  Trade discussions are like
<br>riding a bike, i.e., you have to keep moving forward or you
<br>fall down.  If we do not proactively move forward and
<br>eventually come to a successful conclusion to the Doha round,
<br>the United States could be blamed in some quarters.  The Doha
<br>round was meant to be the &development8 round of
<br>negotiations with significant aid from donor nations
<br>contingent upon the agreement's successful conclusion.  If it
<br>did not pass, some governments that stand to lose aid, such
<br>as Brazil, would likely blame the United States.
<br>
<br>¶10.  (C) Vice President Biden did not commit on any of these
<br>issues but noted that labor interests in the United States
<br>were not satisfied and were looking to the Administration to
<br>establish its labor &bona fides.8  In a year, he said,
<br>movement on economic and trade issues would either be easier
<br>or impossible depending on the direction of the world
<br>economy.
<br>
<br>--------------------
<br>AFGHANISTAN/PAKISTAN
<br>--------------------
<br>
<br>¶11.  (C) Turning to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Vice President
<br>Biden described the importance of combating terrorism and
<br>noted the different elements of the Obama administration's
<br>policy.  First, the focus in Afghanistan is on Al Qaida.  The
<br>Obama administration will not make an open-ended commitment
<br>to building freedom and democracy in Afghanistan because it
<br>is not realistic.  Second, there is no real possibility of
<br>defeating Al Qaida without also dealing with Pakistan.
<br>Third, he recognized that the United States cannot solve the
<br>problem on its own.  The whole world needed to engage.
<br>
<br>¶12.  (C) Vice President Biden said he worried that NATO
<br>countries in Europe underestimated the threat from the region
<br>and viewed the problem as an economic development issue
<br>rather than a security issue, despite the fact that Afghan
<br>opium is primarily exported to Europe and Europe has been the
<br>victim of several terrorist attacks originating from the
<br>region.  Vice President Biden described the complex nature of
<br>the security problem in Afghanistan, commenting that
<br>&besides the demography, geography and history of the
<br>region, we have a lot going for us.8
<br>
<br>¶13.  (C) Vice President Biden noted that the current U.S.
<br>commitment of 63,000 troops to Afghanistan is the result of a
<br>vigorous internal policy debate and would not be sustainable
<br>politically for more than two years without visible signs of
<br>progress.  After two years, the extraordinary cost of
<br>maintaining a robust military presence in Afghanistan would
<br>make additional commitment increasingly difficult.  After
<br>Afghan elections the Administration intends to review the
<br>situation again.  Currently there is little capacity for the
<br>Afghan government to execute many of the functions of
<br>government.  In many areas of the country, local officials
<br>have close to no knowledge of how to govern or even basic
<br>knowledge of payroll or budget.  Part of the reason the
<br>Taliban is strengthening is since the Taliban has the local
<br>capacity to settle basic disputes quickly while central
<br>government courts can take six to eight months to process a
<br>case.
<br>
<br>¶14.  (C) The idea of a strong rule of law under a centralized
<br>
<br>SANTIAGO 00000324  003.2 OF 003
<br>
<br>Karzai government was not realistic.  New policy towards the
<br>Taliban should reflect the reality of the Afghan government's
<br>lack of capacity.  Our policy should first aim to stabilize
<br>the urban areas and surrounding rural communities and then
<br>seek to exploit divisions within the Taliban, co-opting
<br>moderate elements rather than simply defeating militarily all
<br>elements of the Taliban.
<br>
<br>¶15.  (C) On Pakistan, Vice President Biden commented that it
<br>was difficult to convince Pakistan to commit to developing
<br>its counter-insurgency potential.  The threat from India
<br>leads Pakistan to devote the bulk of its defense spending to
<br>conventional warfare capabilities.  However, something must
<br>be done in the meantime.  We need to develop our relationship
<br>with Pakistan beyond its current transactional nature to a
<br>long-term strategic partnership.  We should begin with $1.5
<br>billion per year in economic assistance that is unconditional
<br>and supplement that with military assistance that is
<br>conditioned on the modernization of its command structure and
<br>active action in the field to combat insurgents.  It would be
<br>difficult to convince Congress to support such a plan,
<br>particularly the unconditional civilian component.
<br>
<br>¶16.  (C) Vice President Biden noted that the United States
<br>wants to empower the UN and wants active European
<br>participation in resolving the threats in Pakistan and
<br>Afghanistan.  With the exception of the UK and a few others,
<br>very few Europeans are taking action.  Germany completely
<br>dropped the ball on police training but NATO countries should
<br>continue to provide assistance that is within their capacity
<br>to deliver.
<br>
<br>¶17.  (C) Brown agreed that there was a significant terrorist
<br>threat emanating from the region.  More than 30,000
<br>Pakistanis travel back and forth to the UK each year and
<br>two-thirds of the terrorist threats that UK security forces
<br>investigate originate in Pakistan -- including one on-going
<br>investigation.  The roots of terrorism in Pakistan are
<br>complicated and go beyond the madrasas to, in some areas, a
<br>complete societal incitement to militancy.  Zedari's
<br>commitment to combating terrorism is unclear, although he
<br>always says the right things.
<br>
<br>¶18.  (C) Brown agreed on the need for a shared commitment and
<br>noted that the only way to reduce the threat and eventually
<br>draw down NATO's commitment to the region was by increasing
<br>the capacity of Afghanistani and Pakistani security services.
<br>Dividing the Taliban would greatly reduce its effectiveness,
<br>though doing this made the Iraq problem look easy by
<br>comparison.
<br>
<br>¶19.  (S) Vice President Biden commented that Zedari had told
<br>him two months ago that ISI director &Kiyani will take me
<br>out.8  Brown thought this unlikely and said that Kiyani did
<br>not want to be another Musharraf, rather he would give
<br>civilian leadership scope to function.  However, he was wary
<br>of the Sharif brothers and Zedari.
<br>
<br>¶20.  (U) The Office of the Vice President cleared this
<br>message.
