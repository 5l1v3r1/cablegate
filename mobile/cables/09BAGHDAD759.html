<br>RECONCILIATION; SAYS IT CAN SPLIT AL DURI'S FACTION 
<br>
<br>REF: BAGHDAD 598 
<br>
<br>Classified By: PRT Salah Ad Din Leader Rick Bell for reasons 1.4 (b) an 
<br>d (d). 
<br>
<br>(U) This is a PRT Salah Ad Din (SAD) reporting cable. See 
<br>action request for Department and Embassy Baghdad, para 11. 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) SUMMARY: Men purporting to represent the Muhammad 
<br>Yunis Ahmed (MYA) faction of the Ba'ath Party (BP) told 
<br>Coalition Forces (CF) and the PRT on March 14 that the 
<br>faction wants to reconcile now, and can bring some of Izzat 
<br>Ibrahim al-Duri's IAD faction along. MYA is ready to meet 
<br>with a senior USG official, they said. They stressed that 
<br>they were speaking in confidence: fearing for their own 
<br>safety, they have not yet contacted the Government of Iraq 
<br>(GOI). PRT requests Department and Embassy assistance in 
<br>determining their bona fides. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) On March 14, the PRT and CF met with four men who 
<br>identified themselves as senior Ba'ath Party officials. They 
<br>provided the following unconfirmed information about 
<br>themselves: 
<br>
<br>- XXXXXXXXXXXX     Was three-star general and 
<br>division commander under Saddam; XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>
<br>- XXXXXXXXXXXX Member of SaD Sheikhs' Council, 
<br>chairman of the Ad-Dawr Sheikhs' Council. Brigadier 
<br>general in former regime. XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>
<br>- XXXXXXXXXXXX. Senior official in the former 
<br>Iraqi Intelligence Services (commander of the five southern 
<br>provinces). XXXXXXXXXXXX 
<br>
<br>- XXXXXXXXXXXX. Former brigadier general in 
<br>the air force  XXXXXXXXXXXX. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) The men said they intended this meeting as a formal 
<br>first step, personally authorized by Mohammed Yunis Ahmed 
<br>(MYA), in seeking USG intervention to help reconcile the 
<br>Ba'ath Party (BP) to the GOI. As MYA's putative spokesman, 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXXdid most of the speaking. This cable relays 
<br>considerable detail in order to convey the level of 
<br>discourse. XXXXXXXXXXXX passed a message that MYA is willing to 
<br>meet personally with a high-level USG official to discuss 
<br>reconciliation. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) XXXXXXXXXXXX said the BP is organized and planning for the 
<br>future. He explained that it has split into two groups, one 
<br>following IAD and the other MYA. IAD is not willing to 
<br>negotiate or admit that the BP ever made mistakes. MYA has 
<br>been looking back and believes that Saddam's regime made many 
<br>mistakes. His faction would like to find a peaceful way to 
<br>participate in the democratic process. They have not yet been 
<br>in touch with the GOI because they fear the GOI is under 
<br>Iranian influence and will seek revenge against any BP 
<br>members. MYA's group wants USG assistance to reconcile 
<br>because it believes that after the U.S. leaves Iraq, it will 
<br>be much harder to negotiate and if reconciliation is not 
<br>already well underway by then, there will likely be 
<br>bloodshed. XXXXXXXXXXXX 
<br>said that there are about four million BP 
<br>members who will need to protect themselves because Iranians 
<br>and Shi'a will persecute them and their families. Some of 
<br>IAD's supporters have told MYA's group that they also want to 
<br>reconcile, even without IAD 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) XXXXXXXXXXXX discussed BP dissatisfaction 
<br>with the way Iraq has been run since the 2003 invasion. 
<br>The BP was in existence for 62 years and in power for 35 years. It was 
<br>very influential in building Iraqi society. All educated 
<br>people today were educated under the old regime, which was 
<br>built by the BP. Although there were problems during its 
<br>Qbuilt by the BP. Although there were problems during its 
<br>rule, the last six years have been "ten times worse." Two 
<br>million Iraqis have been killed, two million displaced 
<br>outside the country, and four million displaced internally. 
<br>The U.S. bears a share of moral and legal responsibility for 
<br>this. President Bush admitted that the invasion was based on 
<br>false intelligence regarding WMD. Now the US has allowed 
<br>Iran to develop nuclear capabilities, making that country a 
<br>greater threat than it already was. The GOI is divided and 
<br>corrupt, built on sectarianism. Under the BP all ethnic 
<br>groups were included. What have the Iraqis gained for paying 
<br>such a price? No infrastructure and poor basic services. 
<br>The quality of life in Iraq has become worse. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S) The BP is not against democracy, XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>said, but fears sectarianism and Iranian influence. It wants to 
<br>
<br>BAGHDAD 00000759 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>participate in political life and is against violence. The 
<br>current democracy is built on sectarianism. This has led to 
<br>strife, kidnappings and assassinations. Many now fear that 
<br>the U.S. wants to turn Iraq over to Iran; just as Iran is led 
<br>by the mullahs, GOI officials now consult Ayatollah Sistani 
<br>before making decisions. Shiites show how irrational they 
<br>are in the way they flagellate and beat themselves. The 
<br>Shi'a are loyal to Iran; Iraq could be returning to medieval 
<br>times. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) The current Iraqi Army (IA) is poorly trained, more 
<br>like a militia than a professional army, said Khalaf. The 
<br>U.S. has signed a contract to turn over weapon systems to the 
<br>IA; those weapons should be given to trained professionals. 
<br>Many of the weapons will just end up in the hands of Shiite 
<br>soldiers who are like militiamen. Not all of the IA are 
<br>militias, some are professional, but the top leaders lack 
<br>training. The best, most experienced senior officers are 
<br>outside Iraq now or are just sitting around at home. 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX said that MYA has issued an 
<br>order that BP members are 
<br>prohibited from serving in the new ISF. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (S) The MYA faction now believes multi-party democracy is 
<br>an option, XXXXXXXXXXXX continued. IAD does not agree 
<br>with MYA, who wants to review BP activities and leadership 
<br>from 1968 to the occupation, in order to identify mistakes and put in 
<br>place a strategy for a changed party. IAD absolutely refuses 
<br>and believes he should lead the BP. Because of this 
<br>disagreement the BP had a conference in December 2007 that 
<br>elected MYA as commander. The MYA faction believes the way 
<br>forward must be peaceful, and refuses to use violence. If 
<br>the BP is allowed to compete politically, the will of the 
<br>people will decide. The party just wants the same 
<br>opportunities as others; it wants to announce that the BP is 
<br>back now. Even if it is forbidden to have meetings, the BP 
<br>is "in our hearts and minds, it represents our values, so you 
<br>cannot just get rid of it with a quick decision." People 
<br>believe in the BP more now, and the BP includes all ethnic 
<br>groups. The security agencies know that the BP did not 
<br>commit crimes, actually it fought against AQI. The BP had 
<br>longstanding problems with AQI before 2003, and suffered many 
<br>losses. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (S) So many Iraqis have been murdered by groups like 
<br>Badr, Mahdi Army, former Interior Minister Solah, Quds Force, 
<br>and others. The BP wants peace. Iran stopped the killing 
<br>when CF started paying attention to the connection of 
<br>Iranians to the violence, but after the U.S. leaves, it will 
<br>start again. PM Maliki's words are empty. Iran is getting 
<br>revenge for the Iran-Iraq War. A month ago, the GOI banned 
<br>the use of the word "martyr" for soldiers killed during the 
<br>war with Iran. Now those dead soldiers are referred to as 
<br>"victims of the past regime." This takes away their honor 
<br>for serving their country as soldiers during the war. BP is 
<br>not so narrow-minded now. It wants to have an army that 
<br>represents everybody. The Iraqi Constitution was written too 
<br>quickly and is filled with problems. Iraq has the trappings 
<br>of democracy such as ballot boxes, but sectarianism corrupts 
<br>the result. President Obama said U.S. forces are leaving, so 
<br>"we have no more problems with you now" - help us get the ban 
<br>on the BP lifted, and pardon the loyal nationalist insurgents. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (S) XXXXXXXXXXXX and his colleagues stressed 
<br>that they were speaking in confidence to the USG. 
<br>They explained that they  had not approached the GOI yetbecause 
<br>they fear they will be arrested even though the GOI does not 
<br>have warrants for them. Qarrested even though the GOI does 
<br>not have warrants for them. "Ninety-five percent of us did 
<br>nothing wrong. If there are criminals then try them under
<br> the criminal laws, but allow us to bring back the BP." 
<br>
<br>¶11. (S) COMMENT AND ACTION REQUEST: PRT requests Embassy 
<br>and Department assistance in verifying the bona fides of 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX Nassir, et al. The PRT will work with CF try to 
<br>determine whether the delegation truly represents MYA. It is 
<br>not clear whether there is any connection between this 
<br>meeting and the PRT Tikrit Satellite representative's 
<br>discussion of similar issues with Sheikh Hassan Nida of 
<br>Saddam's tribe, Albu Nasser (reftel). END COMMENT AND ACTION 
<br>REQUEST.
