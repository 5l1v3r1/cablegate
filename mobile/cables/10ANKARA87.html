<br>INTRODUCTION/COMMENT 
<br>-------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) There is much talk in chanceries and in the 
<br>international media these days about Turkey's new, highly 
<br>activist foreign policy, which unquestionably represents a 
<br>transition not only from prior governments, but also from the 
<br>AKP regime before the Gaza/Davos events, and before the 
<br>ascent of Ahmet Davutoglu as Foreign Minister in April.  Some 
<br>commentaries are upbeat, but others, including many experts 
<br>and editorial writers in the US, have expressed concern.  The 
<br>ruling AKP foreign policy is driven by both a desire to be 
<br>more independently activist, and by a more Islamic 
<br>orientation.  Frankly, rational national interest, 
<br>particularly trade opportunities and stability 
<br>considerations, also drives Turkey's new slant.  Major 
<br>challenges with us in the coming months include the direction 
<br>of Turkish-Israeli relations, the fate of the Protocols with 
<br>Armenia, and the Turkish posture vis--vis Iran. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) Does  all this mean that the country is becoming more 
<br>focused on the Islamist world and its Muslim tradition in its 
<br>foreign policy?  Absolutely.  Does it mean that it is 
<br>"abandoning" or wants to abandon its traditional Western 
<br>orientation and willingness to cooperate with us?  Absolutely 
<br>not. At the end of the day we will have to live with a Turkey 
<br>whose population is propelling much of what we see.  This 
<br>calls for a more issue-by-issue approach, and recognition 
<br>that Turkey will often go its own way.  In any case, sooner 
<br>or later we will no longer have to deal with the current cast 
<br>of political leaders, with their special yen for destructive 
<br>drama and - rhetoric.  But we see no one better on the 
<br>horizon, and Turkey will remain a complicated blend of world 
<br>class "Western" institutions, competencies, and orientation, 
<br>and Middle Eastern culture and religion.  END INTRODUCTION. 
<br> 
<br>COMPONENTS OF POLICY 
<br>-------------------- 
<br> 
<br>"The Traditional Western" 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) Turkish policy today is a mix of "traditional Western" 
<br>orientation, attitudes and interests, and two new elements, 
<br>linked with new operational philosophies: "zero conflicts" 
<br>and "neo-Ottomanism."  The traditional still represents the 
<br>core of Turkish foreign policy, and is centered on 
<br>cooperation and integration with the West. Its core is NATO, 
<br>the customs union with the EU, and most significantly, the EU 
<br>accession effort.  This all began with the Ottoman effort to 
<br>emulate the European great powers, and was propelled 
<br>powerfully forward by Ataturk.  Nevertheless the country was 
<br>on the sidelines in World War II.  It was only the threat of 
<br>the USSR, and the dominance (and outstretched hand) of the 
<br>US, that led to the "Turkey we know":  tough combat partner 
<br>in Korea, major NATO ally, US anchor in the Middle East. 
<br>Much of this continues. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) Europe is by far Turkey's most important economic 
<br>partner in terms of investment and trade. The EU accounts for 
<br>42 percent of Turkey,s total trade, while the US accounts 
<br>for a bit less than 5 percent.  While the US is much less 
<br>important in terms of trade statistics, it remains important 
<br>in various sectors (e.g.energy, aviation, military), and in 
<br>various ways.  NATO is essential to and much respected by 
<br> 
<br>ANKARA 00000087  002 OF 006 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Turkey.  (Note:  The fact that "only" about one-third of the 
<br>Turkish population in one poll see NATO as important to 
<br>Turkey's security is actually a plus; on any poll Turks 
<br>usually are overwhelmingly negative about any foreign 
<br>engagement or relationship.  But we should not be too 
<br>sanguine here since support for NATO has been halved over the 
<br>past decade.  End Note)  The military is armed by the US, and 
<br>Turkey recognizes that many fires in its back yard -- from 
<br>Iraq to Afghanistan and Pakistan -- can only be solved by 
<br>close cooperation with and acceptance of US and NATO 
<br>leadership.  Finally, even AKP leaders know that much of 
<br>their allure or "wasta" in the Middle East and elsewhere 
<br>stems from their privileged position in key Western clubs. 
<br>This traditional orientation may be shaken, or reduced, but 
<br>as it has both significant buy-in by elites of all 
<br>philosophies, and many concrete advantages, Turkey will not 
<br>abandon it. 
<br> 
<br>"Zero Problems with Turkey's Neighbors" 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) But this Turkey is trying to "post-modernize" itself. 
<br>One major area of AKP effort has been to resolve problems 
<br>with Turkey's immediate "near abroad."  This effort stands in 
<br>contrast with the "traditional" Turkish policy of letting 
<br>these frozen conflicts fester, and is much more compatible 
<br>with US and European interests.  The list of Turkish 
<br>initiatives under the AKP is impressive:  accepting the Annan 
<br>Plan in 2004 to resolve Cyprus, continuing the 1999 
<br>rapprochement with Greece, the opening to Armenia culminating 
<br>in the signing of recognition protocols, warming and 
<br>productive relations with both Baghdad and Erbil (the latter 
<br>complemented by significant reforms in Turkey's relations 
<br>with its own Kurdish population).  The signature 
<br>accomplishment of this policy is the wooing of Syria.  While 
<br>this road to Damascus in fact was paved by Syria's 
<br>accommodation of prior Turkish governments' demands 
<br>(relinquishing claims on Turkey's Hatay province, expelling 
<br>Ocalan), it is touted by the Turks as a game-changer.  As 
<br>noted below, they have leveraged it to tackle a number of 
<br>regional problems, from Lebanon to Iran. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) While this new approach is to be applauded, there is a 
<br>fly in its ointment.  Little of true practical and final 
<br>accomplishment has been achieved.  Cyprus is still split 
<br>(albeit the fault, at least in terms of the Annan plan, lies 
<br>more with the Greek Cypriots and the EU); tensions with 
<br>Greece in the Aegean continue; the Protocols with Armenia 
<br>have not been ratified due to Turkish concerns about 
<br>Nagorno-Karabakh; Iraq's instability and the KRG's 
<br>unwillingness to do more against the PKK raise questions 
<br>about the sustainability of Turkey's constructive Iraq 
<br>policy; the rapprochement with Syria has not really produced 
<br>any Syrian "flip" away from Iran.  Granted, Turkey is dealing 
<br>with some of the world's most difficult actors, and facing 
<br>stiff opposition at home to making more concessions, but the 
<br>proof of this pudding is yet to be seen. 
<br> 
<br>"Neo Ottomanism" 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) The idea of Turkey using its cultural and religious 
<br>links to the Middle East to the advantage of both Turkish 
<br>interests and regional stability is not new with the AKP, but 
<br>has been given much more priority by it, in part because of 
<br>the Islamic orientation of much of the party, including 
<br>leaders Erdogan, Gul, and Davutoglu.  Moreover, the AKP's 
<br>constant harping on its unique understanding of the region, 
<br>and outreach to populations over the heads of conservative, 
<br>pro-US governments, have led to accusations of 
<br>"neo-Ottomanism."  Rather than deny, Davutoglu has embraced 
<br>this accusation.  Himself the grandson of an Ottoman soldier 
<br> 
<br>ANKARA 00000087  003 OF 006 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>who fought in Gaza, Davutoglu summed up the Davutoglu/AKP 
<br>philosophy in an extraordinary speech in Sarajevo in late 
<br>2009 (REF A).  His thesis: the Balkans, Caucasus, and Middle 
<br>East were all better off when under Ottoman control or 
<br>influence; peace and progress prevailed.  Alas the region has 
<br>been ravaged by division and war ever since.  (He was too 
<br>clever to explicitly blame all that on the imperialist 
<br>western powers, but came close). However, now Turkey is back, 
<br>ready to lead -- or even unite.  (Davutoglu: "We will 
<br>re-establish this (Ottoman) Balkan"). 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (C) While this speech was given in the Balkans, most of 
<br>its impact is in the Middle East.  Davutoglu's theory is that 
<br>most of the regimes there are both undemocratic and 
<br>illegitimate.  Turkey, building on the alleged admiration 
<br>among Middle Eastern populations for its economic success and 
<br>power, and willing to stand up for the interests of the 
<br>people, reaches over the regimes to the "Arab street." 
<br>Turkey's excoriating the Israelis over Gaza, culminating in 
<br>the insulting treatment of President Peres by Erdogan at 
<br>Davos in 2009, illustrates this trend.  To capitalize on its 
<br>rapport with the people, and supposed diplomatic expertise 
<br>and Ottoman experience, Turkey has thrown itself into a 
<br>half-dozen conflicts as a mediator.  This has worked well, as 
<br>noted above, with Iraq, and was quite successful in the 
<br>Syrian-Israeli talks before Gaza.  Turkey has also achieved 
<br>some limited success on Lebanon and in bringing Saudi Arabia 
<br>and Syria together.  As noted below, however, this policy 
<br>brings with it great frictions, not just with us and the 
<br>Europeans but with many supposed beneficiaries of a return to 
<br>Ottoman suzerainty.  Furthermore, it has not achieved any 
<br>single success of note. 
<br> 
<br>WHY THE CHANGE? 
<br>--------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C) Various factors explain the shifts we see in Turkish 
<br>foreign policy beyond the personal views of the AKP 
<br>leadership: 
<br> 
<br>-- Islamization:  As reported REF B, religiosity has been 
<br>increasing in Turkey in past years, just as has been seen in 
<br>many other Muslim societies.  The AKP is both a beneficiary 
<br>of, and a stimulus for, this phenomenon.  However, bitter 
<br>opposition within Turkey against domestic "pro-Islamic" 
<br>reforms (e.g., head scarves) has frustrated the AKP, and a 
<br>more "Islamic" or "Middle Eastern" foreign policy offers an 
<br>alternative sop for the AKP's devout base. 
<br> 
<br>-- Success:  Despite its problems, Turkey over the past 50 
<br>years has been a success story, rising to the 16th largest 
<br>economy and membership in the G-20.  This, along with its 
<br>extraordinary security situation compared to all other 
<br>regional states, and democratic system, encourage a more 
<br>active -- and more independent -- leadership role in regional 
<br>and even global affairs. 
<br> 
<br>-- Economics:  one secret of Turkish success has been its 
<br>trade and technology-led economic growth.  This growth is in 
<br>good part thanks to its customs union with the EU, by far its 
<br>biggest export market, and resulting investment from the EU, 
<br>as well as decades of technology transfer and educational 
<br>assistance from the U.S.  Nevertheless, with exports to the 
<br>EU down due to the 2008-2009 crisis, Turkey is looking for 
<br>new markets, particularly in the hydrocarbon rich Arab world, 
<br>Iran, Russia, and Caucasus/Central Asia.  They have money, 
<br>and strong import demand, and Turkey is dependent on them for 
<br>its oil and gas.  These countries, however, (along with 
<br>China-another Turkish export target) tend much more than the 
<br>EU and North America to mix politics and trade.  To some 
<br> 
<br>ANKARA 00000087  004 OF 006 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>degree the West thus is taken for granted and economic 
<br>priority is directed towards relations with the Middle East 
<br>and "Eurasia." 
<br> 
<br>-- Civilians ascendant: Erdogan's political success - 
<br>together with a number of messy scandals resulting in public 
<br>investigation - has meant that the Turkish General Staff now 
<br>plays a much smaller role in defining Turkey's foreign 
<br>policy.  Turkey's support to NATO is still strong, but it now 
<br>lacks the suspicion of Russia which the cold-war instinct of 
<br>General Staff brought to the mix. 
<br> 
<br>-- EU disillusionment:  Both popular and elite Turkish 
<br>opinion has recently grown much more pessimistic about 
<br>eventual EU membership -- or even its value.  The reasons for 
<br>this are complex, but include the shifting mood in Europe 
<br>towards Islam, the replacement of "pro-Turkey" leaders in 
<br>France and Germany by Sarkozy and Merkel, both decidedly cool 
<br>towards Turkey's EU membership, and a sense in Turkey of 
<br>distance from and lack of sympathy for Europe. 
<br> 
<br>-- Relativization of the Western anchor.  An op-ed in the 
<br>Financial Times by Gideon Rechman on January 4 noted 
<br>correctly the tendency of the "young giants" -- South Africa, 
<br>Brazil, India, and Turkey -- to pursue Third Worldish 
<br>policies and rhetoric even while benefitting enormously from 
<br>the globalized trade and international security created and 
<br>maintained by the "West."  That certainly characterizes 
<br>Turkey.  With the end of the cold war, relative success in 
<br>the struggle with the PKK, and the "taming" of Syria, Iraq, 
<br>and (at least from Turkey's point of view) Iran, Turkey's 
<br>need for NATO and U.S. security is reduced.  Its dependence 
<br>on Western trade, investment, technology transfer and 
<br>educational exchange remains critical, but is regarded as a 
<br>"free good" that Turkey deserves and does not have to expend 
<br>effort for.  Relations with its various new friends in the 
<br>North-East-South or on the other hand require effort which is 
<br>facilitated by some downplaying of Turkey's Western anchor. 
<br> 
<br>DAVUTOGLU DISCONTENTS 
<br>--------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (C) The AKP's new approach to international affairs 
<br>receives mixed reviews inside and outside Turkey.  It is not 
<br>a major factor in the AKP's relative popularity, but several 
<br>elements of it (unfortunately, those we are least happy with) 
<br>do appeal to voters.  Criticism of Israel post-Gaza is 
<br>overwhelmingly popular, and the relatively soft Turkish 
<br>position on Iran -- a country about which many Turks are 
<br>skeptical -- is presumably helpful with a narrow, but for 
<br>Erdogan's electoral fate important, group of Islamic voters 
<br>associated with former PM Erbakan. 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (C) Nevertheless, many in Turkey's large westernized 
<br>elite see the Islamic Outreach as a complement to the alleged 
<br>AKP plan to Islamize Turkish society, and complain bitterly 
<br>about their country's losing its western moorings.  The 
<br>Nationalist segment in Turkey, mobilized most by the 
<br>Nationalist Action Party (MHP), sees the AKP's compromises on 
<br>Armenia, the KRG in northern Iraq, Cyprus, etc, as a betrayal 
<br>of diaspora "Turks" (the Iraqi Turkomen, Azeris, Turkish 
<br>Cypriots, etc) and charges that the AKP is trying to replace 
<br>the Republic's organizing principle of "Turkism" with the 
<br>broader Islamic "Umma."  The Republican People's Party (CHP), 
<br>the lead opposition party, attacks AKP foreign policy 
<br>relatively ineffectively with a mix of MHP-like nationalist 
<br>rhetoric and "abandoning the west" criticism. 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (C) But it is in the EU that the Erdogan foreign policy 
<br>of late has run into the heaviest of sailing.  To some degree 
<br> 
<br>ANKARA 00000087  005 OF 006 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>European angst at Turkey's "new direction" is viewed as an 
<br>excuse to pummel Turkey to score domestic points among 
<br>anti-foreigner elements.  But there is real concern in 
<br>Europe, made manifest by the Rasmussen NATO SecGen issue last 
<br>April.  Europeans were furious with Turkey's presentng itself 
<br>as the "Islamic" voice or conscience in NATO, having 
<br>consulted with Middle Eastern States before talking to its 
<br>NATO allies.  Extrapolating that behavior into the even more 
<br>diversity-intolerant EU is a nightmare.  Erdogan's foreign 
<br>(and domestic) policy orientation conjures up not just a 
<br>clash of Christianity and Islam, but the spectre of a "meld" 
<br>of Europe and the Middle East, and of Europe's secularlism 
<br>with oriental religiosity.  Davutoglu and others argue that 
<br>Turkey's "success" as a coming Middle East power makes it 
<br>more attractive to the EU -- giving Europe a new foreign 
<br>policy "market" through Turkey.  While some in Europe appear 
<br>interested in this idea, ironically including Turkey EU 
<br>membership skeptic France, this does not seem to carry much 
<br>weight in most European capitals, let alone populations. 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (C) Finally, not all of the ex-Ottomans look with 
<br>fondness on their past under the Pashas, or yearn for 
<br>Turkey's return.  Reaction among many in the Balkans to 
<br>Davutoglu's Sarejevo speech (REF A) was quite strong. In the 
<br>Middle East itself, the Arab street might applaud Turkey's 
<br>populistic and essentially cost-free support for more radical 
<br>elements, but it's not particularly appreciated by rulers 
<br>(although Turkey seems to have made some progress with Syria, 
<br>brokered a rapprochement between President Bashir and Saudi 
<br>King Abdullah, and has had some role in resolving the Lebanon 
<br>cabinet stalemate).  Sooner or later, though, Turkey will 
<br>have to produce results, take risks, commit real resources, 
<br>and take hard decisions to augment a policy now consisting 
<br>mainly of popular slogans, ceaseless trips, and innumerable 
<br>signatures on MOUs of little importance.  The experience with 
<br>Iran, which despite significant Turkish verbal support and 
<br>wooing, appears uninterested in granting Turkey any 
<br>concessions, or agreeing to a Turkish lead in mediation 
<br>efforts, is telling. 
<br> 
<br>THE PROBLEM FOR THE US 
<br>---------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶14. (C) Turkey's new foreign policy is a mixed bag for us. 
<br>Having regional heavyweights take on burdens, thereby 
<br>relieving us, has long been a desired goal of US policy, but 
<br>it comes with a certain loss of control.  Nevertheless, on a 
<br>whole host of key issues of supreme importance to us -- 
<br>Afghanistan and Pakistan, cooperation in and on Iraq, NATO 
<br>efforts (although a leading Turkish role in Missile Defense 
<br>will not be easy) -- Turkey is a crucial ally, and our use of 
<br>Incirlik, Habur gate, and Turkish airspace for our Iraq and 
<br>Afghanistan operations is indispensible.  Its "zero 
<br>conflicts" initiatives, which have moved Turkey forward on 
<br>more of the key bilateral spats -- Cyprus, Greece, Kurds, 
<br>Northern Iraq, Armenia -- than we have seen with any other 
<br>Turkish government, also support U.S. interests. 
<br> 
<br>¶15. (C) Nevertheless, these latter issues illustrate two 
<br>problems.  At least in Turkish eyes, on this complex of 
<br>issues the US , especially the media, interest groups, and 
<br>Congress, default to a "blame Turkey" posture regardless of 
<br>whatever it does.  Second, Turkey has repeatedly run into 
<br>trouble actually consummating these various openings -- the 
<br>Armenian protocols being the best example, but continued 
<br>overflights of Greek islands and domestic opposition to the 
<br>Kurdish opening are also relevant.  What we fear is that this 
<br>inability to bring to conclusion foreign policy initiatives 
<br>will affect not just the above, but most Turkish policy, 
<br>given the over-extension of Davutoglu and his team, and a 
<br> 
<br>ANKARA 00000087  006 OF 006 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>tendency to substitute rhetoric for long term investment of 
<br>diplomatic, military, and assistance capital.  (Fortunately, 
<br>Afghanistan/Pakistan and Iraq are the two major exceptions to 
<br>this tendency.) 
<br> 
<br>¶16. (C) The greatest potential strategic problem for the US, 
<br>however, and the one that has some of the commentators 
<br>howling, is the Turks neo-Ottoman posturing around the Middle 
<br>East and Balkans.  This "back to the past" attitude so clear 
<br>in Davutoglu's Sarajevo speech, combined with the Turks' 
<br>tendency to execute it through alliances with more Islamic or 
<br>more worrisome local actors, constantly creates new problems. 
<br> Part of this is structural.  Despite their success and 
<br>relative power, the Turks really can't compete on equal terms 
<br>with either the US or regional "leaders" (EU in the Balkans, 
<br>Russia in the Caucasus/Black Sea, Saudis, Egyptians and even 
<br>Iranians in the ME).  With Rolls Royce ambitions but Rover 
<br>resources, to cut themselves in on the action the Turks have 
<br>to "cheat" by finding an underdog (this also plays to 
<br>Erdogan's own worldview), a Siladjcic, Mish'al, or 
<br>Ahmadinejad, who will be happy to have the Turks take up his 
<br>cause.  The Turks then attempt to ram through revisions to at 
<br>least the reigning "Western" position to the favor of their 
<br>guy.  Given, again, the questioning of Western policy and 
<br>motives by much of the Turkish public and the AKP, such an 
<br>approach provides a relatively low cost and popular tool to 
<br>demonstrate influence, power, and the "we're back" slogan. 
<br> 
<br>¶17. (C) This has been, so far, manageable, if at times high 
<br>maintenance, in the Balkans and Mideast, although the damage 
<br>to Israeli-Turkish relations remains serious.  If the Turks 
<br>are genuine in their desire to draw Syria away from Iran, and 
<br>if they begin achieving real success rather than telephone 
<br>books worth of questionable protocols, then that will be of 
<br>benefit to us all.  But with Iran itself it is a different 
<br>story.  REF C  describes the background to the Turkish 
<br>relationship with Iran, one more complicated than with their 
<br>ex-Ottoman Arab and other subjects.  Trade/hydrocarbon 
<br>interests, Turkish aversion to sanctions stemming from the 
<br>first Gulf War, Erdogan's vocal "third worldism" and certain 
<br>domestic political considerations all push Turkey in the 
<br>wrong direction.   Unlike with many of the other issues, 
<br>however, Turkey will have to stand and be counted on Iran, in 
<br>the Security Council, with MD, and in implementation of UN or 
<br>US sanctions.  This will have a profound effect on relations 
<br>second only to the fate of the Armenian protocols over the 
<br>next year.
