<br>
<br>CLASSIFIED BY: Robin D. Meyer, Political Counselor, DOS, POL; REASON:
<br>1.4(B), (D)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: President Chavez made socialism taste better with
<br>the December 22 opening of a "socialist arepera" serving
<br>Venezuelan-style tortillas at a fraction of their usual price.
<br>The "Arepera Socialista" is planned to be the first of a chain of
<br>Venezuelan government (GBRV) restaurants run by the Ministry of
<br>Commerce. This restaurant is the GBRV's latest effort at setting
<br>up alternatives to the private market, branding national symbols,
<br>like the "arepa," as part of the Bolivarian Revolution, and
<br>providing tangible benefits to its electoral base before the
<br>September legislative elections. End Summary.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Socialism's Tangible - and Tasty -- Benefits
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) President Chavez opened the "Arepera Socialista" with much
<br>fanfare on December 22, advertising its low price and high quality
<br>as symbolic of the benefits of his socialist revolution. (Note:
<br>"Arepas" are a Venezualan-style thick cornmeal tortilla usually
<br>used for a type of sandwich. End Note.) The restaurant, located
<br>in a lower middle class neighborhood of Caracas, serves "arepas"
<br>for about a fourth of their regular price. It is currently only
<br>open during weekday mornings, although there are plans to extend
<br>its hours, add coffee and fresh juice to its menu, and open two new
<br>locations in working class neighborhoods.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) On a January 8 visit, EmbOffs witnessed a long line of
<br>people waiting to get into the restaurant but surprisingly rapid
<br>service. Inside, one wall was dominated by a quote in large red
<br>lettering from Simon Bolivar: "The best system of government is
<br>that which produces the greatest happiness." An employee managing
<br>the line said the restaurant served 1,200 customers per day. One
<br>man in line said he worked in the neighborhood and came every day
<br>since the food was excellent and cheap.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Money is Secondary in Socialist Restaurants
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶4. (U) According to Minister of Commerce Eduardo Saman, people
<br>can count on low prices at the "arepera socialista" because the
<br>ingredients come from government-owned companies and other
<br>products, such as boxed juices, come from government-owned
<br>companies. Saman claimed the prices were sufficient to cover the
<br>store's operating costs. He also announced on December 23 that a
<br>chain of "Arepera Socialista" restaurants would be opened
<br>throughout Venezuela as part of the Socialist Market Cooperatives
<br>run by the Ministry of Commerce. Saman himself worked at the
<br>restaurant on December 24; other Ministry of Commerce employees
<br>were "volunteering" at the restaurant on the day of the Emboffs'
<br>visit. About 30 people work at the restaurant.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶4. (U) Besides the price, Saman highlighted another key difference
<br>between socialist and capitalist "arepera": customers pay only
<br>after eating, while "in fast food chains . . . they only think
<br>about money." In the "Arepera Socialista," the cash register is in
<br>a corner of the room and customers pay only after eating,
<br>self-reporting how many of the "arepas" they ate.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Comment: Let Them Eat Arepas
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Facing high inflation, electricity and water rationing,
<br>and failing public services, Chavez may see the "arepera
<br>socialista" as a relatively quick and easy way to promote the
<br>
<br>CARACAS 00000043 002 OF 002
<br>
<br>
<br>benefits of "socialism" to his electoral base before the September
<br>legislative elections. The challenge will be meeting demand
<br>without raising the subsidized price or cutting quality.
