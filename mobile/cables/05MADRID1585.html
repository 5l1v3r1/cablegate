<br>TAGS: PREL PGOV PTER SP
<br>SUBJECT: SPANISH DEFENSE MINISTRY: "TRUST US ON VENEZUELA
<br>SALE"
<br>
<br>Classified By: Charge d'Affaires J. Robert Manzanares,
<br>reasons 1.4(b) and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Secretary of State for Defense (deputy
<br>minister equivalent) Francisco Pardo called a meeting with
<br>Charge April 20 to discuss Spain's plan to sell ships and
<br>planes to Venezuela. Pardo said the Zapatero government
<br>wanted to be as transparent as possible on the sale but was
<br>frustrated that "third parties" were using the sale to drive
<br>the U.S. and Spain apart. Spain is not selling corvette
<br>class vessels to Venezuela and none of the ships Spain sells
<br>will have offensive capabilities, declared Pardo. Although
<br>admitting the ships' configuration has not yet been
<br>determined, Pardo said the Spanish government deserves the
<br>United States' trust that Spain "will do the right thing."
<br>Pardo hoped the Venezuela issue would not be the focus of
<br>Defense Mininster Bono's May 3 meeting with Secretary
<br>Rumsfeld, and would not overshadow areas of strong U.S.-Spain
<br>cooperation, such as Afghanistan. End summary.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Pardo told Charge (who was joined by defense attache
<br>and pol-miloff) he called the meeting "in the interest of
<br>transparency" and to avoid "manipulations" of information
<br>about the Venezuela sale by third parties. The Zapatero
<br>government and the defense ministry wanted to be "as clear as
<br>possible" with the U.S. on what the Venezuela sale involved
<br>and did not involve, because others, such as the opposition
<br>Popular Party, were using the Venezuela sale to "drive a
<br>wedge" between the Zapatero government and the U.S.
<br>government. Pardo said he was "very bothered" that third
<br>parties have created a problem where there shouldn't be one."
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Pardo then complained that Minister of Defense Bono
<br>had no sooner ended his appearance in Congress the day before
<br>when the Popular Party started spreading claims in the press
<br>that some of the ships Spain would be selling Venezuela would
<br>have offensive capabilities. "This would be difficult for
<br>the Popular Party to know," quipped Pardo, "since the
<br>configuration of the ships hasn't even been determined yet."
<br>In Pardo's view this illustrated how the Popular Party was
<br>using the Venezuela sale and Spain-U.S. relations for its own
<br>political purposes. Pardo said he had instructed the
<br>Navantia shipyard not do include anything in the ships'
<br>configuration that would go against the memorandum of
<br>agreement between Spain and Venezuela, including anything
<br>that could constitute offensive capability.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Pardo then showed Charge a copy of the memorandum of
<br>agreement signed between Spain and Venezuela, pointed to the
<br>portion describing the types of ships that would be sold, and
<br>emphasized that nowhere did it mention "corvettes" as some in
<br>the Popular Party and press had claimed Spain planned to sell
<br>Venezuela. "I do not have to show you this classified
<br>document," said Pardo, "but I want us both to be absolutely
<br>clear on what we are and are not selling here." Pardo said
<br>he wanted to be clear: Spain is only contemplating selling
<br>Venezuela coastal patrol ships and oceanic patrol ships, the
<br>latter needed to patrol Venezuela's free economic zone.
<br>Spain will not be selling Venezuela corvettes.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) When asked what tonnage the ships would have, Pardo
<br>said those specifications had also not yet been determined,
<br>but the displacement would likely be between 1,200 and 1,700
<br>tons. Defense attache noted that ships in that displacement
<br>range could be outfitted to carry missiles, regardless of
<br>whether they're called corvettes or patrol boats. Noticeably
<br>bothered, Pardo replied emphatically, "The ships will not
<br>carry missiles -- that's what I'm trying to explain. Please
<br>trust us." Pardo insisted that the Zapatero government and
<br>the defense ministry are "responsible" and will not permit
<br>the ships to carry offensive weapons. "We believe we deserve
<br>your trust," said Pardo, adding "you should listen to what we
<br>at the ministry tell you before you believe what a Spanish
<br>congressman says (referring to Popular Party critics)."
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Pardo then pointed out that "something the opposition
<br>and the press are missing" is that the industrial portion of
<br>the deal, including transport planes and ships to carry
<br>petroleum and asphalt, is worth much more than the military
<br>portion. When asked how much the military and industrial
<br>portions of the sale would be worth, Pardo demurred, saying
<br>he could not give us numbers because the have not been worked
<br>out yet, but he assured us the non-military portion was more
<br>significant than the military.
<br>¶7. (C) Pardo restated his concern that third parties were
<br>succeeding in making this a bigger issue than it should be,
<br>and said he was "very frustrated" by that. Pardo claimed
<br>that many other European countries "with good relations with
<br>the U.S." were selling equipment with much more offensive
<br>capability to the Chavez government than Spain. He then
<br>said he hoped the issue would not come up in Minister Bono's
<br>May 3 meeting with SecDef Rumsfeld because "we (Spain and the
<br>U.S.) have already gotten beyond it."
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Charge explained to Pardo that the U.S. is concerned
<br>about the Venezuela sale not because "third parties" such as
<br>the Popular Party had made an issue of it, but because the
<br>U.S. believes the sale could add to Venezuela's ability to
<br>cause destabilization in the region. In addition, Spain's
<br>engagement with Venezuela, including by virtue of the sale,
<br>could also lend Chavez political visibility and legitimacy he
<br>otherwise would not have. Charge made clear the U.S. is very
<br>concerned about Chavez's non-democratic moves in his own
<br>country and his destabilizing activities in other countries
<br>of Latin America. The last thing anyone needs to do right
<br>now, explained Charge, is do something to give Chavez more
<br>political and military muscle, which seems to us exactly what
<br>Spain is doing. Charge also told Pardo it was not realistic
<br>to think the Venezuela sale would not come up in the
<br>Bono-Rumsfeld meeting. It was bound to be raised because it
<br>remains an important issue for the U.S.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Pardo replied that although he understood the topic
<br>would come up in the meeting, he hoped it would not be main
<br>subject discussed and "the only thing the newspapers talk
<br>about afterward." The Zapatero government, he said, has made
<br>numerous gestures to show the U.S. Spain wants to improve
<br>relations, and will continue to do so, and does not feel the
<br>focus should always be on the negative aspects of the
<br>relationship, such as the Venezuela sale. "Our decisions to
<br>increase our troop presence in Afghanistan last fall, and to
<br>lead a PRT this year in western Afghanistan, were taken
<br>because we are a loyal ally of the U.S.," said Pardo. The
<br>Spanish government believes it should get some degree of
<br>recognition for such moves and hopes that the focus of the
<br>Bono-Rumsfeld meeting can be areas in which Spain and the
<br>U.S. cooperate, such as Afghanistan, and not only on problem
<br>areas like Venezuela. Pardo then said the Ministry of
<br>Defense is probably the most supportive ministry in the
<br>Spanish government of positive U.S.-Spain relations.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Comment: Pardo made every effort to show that he
<br>was very irritated that the Venezuela sale had become such a
<br>big issue in the Spanish press, in internal Spanish politics,
<br>and in U.S.-Spain relations. The purpose of the meeting
<br>appeared to be to demonstrate this irritation and to press
<br>Charge to do what he could to exclude the Venezuela sale from
<br>the Bono-Rumsfeld agenda. Charge made clear the U.S. was
<br>troubled by the matter exclusive of the interests of any
<br>third parties, the issue would very likely come up during
<br>Bono's meeting with Rumsfeld, and the U.S. remained concerned
<br>about the sale's ability to bolster Chavez politically and
<br>militarily.
