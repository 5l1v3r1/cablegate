<br>
<br>SUMMARY:
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) Ambassador met February 10 with Minister of Culture
<br>Angeles Gonzalez Sinde to discuss bilateral cooperation on
<br>cultural issues, intellectual property rights and draft
<br>legislation that would enhance the government's ability to
<br>combat digital piracy, and the Holocaust-related claim by
<br>AMCIT Claude Cassirer on a State-owned painting in Madrid's
<br>Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum. The Minister reiterated the
<br>government's request that the Embassy continue to engage with
<br>the political opposition on draft legislation for shutting
<br>down pirate websites. With respect to the Cassirer claim,
<br>Ministry officials says the Spanish state is prohibited from
<br>giving away property or offering compensation, but the
<br>Ambassador asked the Minister to look at some different
<br>options to resolve the matter in a more satisfactory fashion.
<br>End Summary.
<br>
<br>CULTURAL COOPERATION
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) The Minister was accompanied by her Chief of Staff,
<br>Javier Bonilla, and Director General (DG) for Cultural Policy
<br>and Industries Guillermo Corral van Damme. Ambassador
<br>Solomont began by listing the various cultural events he has
<br>participated in since his recent arrival. The Ambassador
<br>also mentioned the partnership between the Boston-based
<br>Berklee School of Music and Spain's General Society of
<br>Authors and Publishers (SGAE) in developing a cultural center
<br>and music university in Valencia, which he characterized as
<br>an "ambitious project." The Ambassador also thanked the
<br>Minister for her work on the Fulbright grantee selection
<br>boards and her speech at the November 2009 event celebrating
<br>the 50th anniversary of the first Spanish grants awarded
<br>under the program. Finally, he mentioned that the Boston
<br>Museum of Fine Arts plans to lend a John Singer Sargent
<br>painting, which was influenced by the Velazquez masterpiece
<br>"Las Meninas," to the Prado, and he hoped the Minister could
<br>attend a reception for the Boston delegation in March.
<br>
<br>IPR PROTECTION AND ANTI-PIRACY MEASURES
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) Ambassador Solomont said he had heard a great deal
<br>about Spain's Internet piracy problem, from MPAA CEO Glickman
<br>and others, and asked where things stand with the
<br>government's legislative proposal (ref B) on shutting down or
<br>blocking pirate websites. Minister Gonzalez-Sinde replied
<br>that everything the government tries to do in this area is
<br>big news, since attempts to regulate Internet activity are of
<br>intense interest to young people, the media, and companies
<br>like Google. The government's proposal, she said, is quite
<br>reasonable and even modest. The government has pledged not
<br>to move aggressively against citizens and individual users as
<br>has been proposed in France and the UK, but its initiative is
<br>nonetheless controversial. Many politicians, she averred,
<br>have little information or understanding of the issue. Even
<br>those who recognize the damage that Internet piracy does to
<br>cultural industries have not been helpful.
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) At the same time, the Minister said there has been a
<br>lot of progress and an open public debate on the issues
<br>surrounding Internet piracy since she came into office last
<br>April. There are still populist demands for "free culture"
<br>on the Internet, but these are being taken less seriously in
<br>the media. The Internet is shaking up traditional modes of
<br>cultural distribution, she said. Increased use of the e-book
<br>is sensitizing authors and influential media owners to the
<br>piracy problem.
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) The Congressional debate over the government's draft
<br>law will be complicated, and this is where the Minister said
<br>the Ambassador can help. The Government believes it is
<br>making progress with Deputies from the ruling Spanish
<br>Socialist Workers Party (PSOE), but is concerned about the
<br>opposition Populist Party (PP). The Ambassador noted he had
<br>raised the issue in his initial meeting with PP leader
<br>Mariano Rajoy and had told him how important the issue is to
<br>the USG and private industry. Gonzalez-Sinde pointed out
<br>that if the government does not solve this problem now, it
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000174 002.3 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>could become an issue in the next presidential campaign.
<br>Should the PP come back to power, it will have to deal with
<br>this issue, because the current situation is unsustainable
<br>over time. (Comment: As reported septel, DG Corral told
<br>econoffs recently that the government faces opposition from
<br>some members of the ruling party, and he asked us to make our
<br>views known to legislators from the regional Convergencia i
<br>Unio (Cataluna) and Partido Nacional Vasco (Basque Country)
<br>blocs.)
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) Ambassador said the USG wants to see the legislation
<br>move forward in Congress and not be weakened in the amendment
<br>process. He also noted that the music industry in particular
<br>does not believe the government's proposal will solve the
<br>problem, to which the Minister replied that the Government
<br>has committed to trying this approach first, and if it
<br>doesn't prove effective, they will come back with additional
<br>and perhaps stronger measures. The music industry is
<br>important to Spain, she said, because it helps promote the
<br>Spanish language in Latin America and also in the United
<br>States.
<br>
<br>¶7. (U) On another issue, the Minister raised the draft law
<br>being considered by the Catalan regional legislature that
<br>would require that foreign films be dubbed or subtitled into
<br>the Catalan language (ref A). She placed the issue in the
<br>context of requirements that television networks finance and
<br>broadcast Spanish and European films, and said it was also
<br>related to the transition of televisions and films from
<br>analog to digital format. She said the Catalan regional
<br>government (Generalitat) is responding to public interest in
<br>promoting the language and sees these other initiatives as
<br>unnatural and unbalanced. It is trying to push back, but its
<br>attempt to require that more films be shown in Catalan is
<br>risky, as major studios and distributors oppose it. So do
<br>movie house owners, who cite low demand because, in their
<br>experience, even Catalan speakers prefer to see movies in
<br>Spanish. Gonzalez-Sinde was not certain whether the regional
<br>Parliament would pass the law in its current session.
<br>
<br>CASSIRER CLAIM
<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU) The Ambassador raised the claim of AMCIT Claude
<br>Cassirer to a Camille Pissarro painting that is currently
<br>part of the Thyssen Museum's permanent collection. The
<br>Ambassador noted that Spain had participated in the 1998
<br>Washington Conference on Nazi Confiscated Art and in last
<br>year's Prague Conference. Spain had signed the Declarations
<br>of Principles but was in the position of possessing a
<br>painting that the Nazis had forced its original owner to
<br>sell. He cited a German government letter stating that the
<br>compensation the owner had received from Germany for the
<br>painting's original disappearance did not extinguish the
<br>family's claim to restitution or compensation. Ambassador
<br>hoped the GOS would facilitate face-to-face negotiations on
<br>compensation, as opposed to "moral recognition."
<br>Acknowledging that the claimant has a lawsuit against Spain
<br>and the Thyssen Foundation before the 9th Circuit Court of
<br>Appeals, Ambassador asked what prevented the GOS from playing
<br>a stronger hand outside the legal process.
<br>
<br>¶9. (SBU) Minister Gonzalez-Sinde replied that lawyers for the
<br>MFA and the Museum have advised that Spain is legally barred
<br>from returning the painting or paying compensation. She
<br>offered to speak again to FM Moratinos to see if anything can
<br>be done. DG Corral pointed out that Spain had acquired the
<br>painting legally and in good faith and had no involvement in
<br>the transaction in which a Nazi art dealer coerced the
<br>painting from its owner. The Thyssen Foundation manages the
<br>collection that includes the painting, but the State owns it.
<br>There is no legal way for the State to surrender its
<br>property absent a judicial order, he said, and the government
<br>could be sued if it tried. The State is legally bound to
<br>protect its property, even at times against its own will.
<br>
<br>¶10. (SBU) Spain is sensitive to the family's claim, Corral
<br>said, but does not believe it can legally negotiate
<br>compensation. It might, however, be able to make gestures to
<br>the family and to the Los Angeles Jewish community. The
<br>government could, for example, organize and fund travel to
<br>Spain and cultural exchanges to promote mutual understanding
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000174 003.3 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>and appreciation while giving due recognition to the Cassirer
<br>family.
<br>
<br>¶11. (SBU) Ambassador suggested that the GOS try to come up
<br>with creative solutions. At the same time, he undertook to
<br>convey the GOS concerns to Cassirer's attorneys and to ask
<br>them to offer a series of options for the government to
<br>consider. If there appear to be viable options, they could
<br>serve as a basis for direct negotiations. Post will follow
<br>up with EUR/OHI.
