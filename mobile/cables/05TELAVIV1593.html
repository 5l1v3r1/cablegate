<br>REF: STATE 26053 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer; Reasons: 1.4 (B) and (D). 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (S) SUMMARY:  Israel sees Iran as the primary threat to 
<br>its security and sees the enrichment cycle as the "point of 
<br>no return" for Tehran's nuclear weapons program.  The GOI 
<br>believes that diplomatic pressure with teeth, such as 
<br>sanctions, can affect Iranian behavior, and is lobbying the 
<br>EU-3 and IAEA on details of a permanent suspension agreement. 
<br> The Israelis support a unified international front but are 
<br>concerned that the USG may move toward the EU position. 
<br>Despite the GOI's focus on the diplomatic track, public and 
<br>private speculation about possible Israeli air strikes 
<br>continues.  In weighing the military options, the GOI is 
<br>aware of significant differences from its successful strike 
<br>against Iraq's nuclear program in 1981, including an 
<br>uncertain and dispersed target set, the presence of coalition 
<br>forces in Iraq and the Gulf, Iranian capabilities to 
<br>retaliate through Hizballah and terrorism, and the changed 
<br>strategic environment.  END SUMMARY. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
<br>The Iranian Threat, "Point of No Return," and Timelines 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S) PM Sharon calls Iran "the main threat to Israel" and 
<br>has recently expressed concern that some states are "getting 
<br>used to" the idea of Iran obtaining nuclear weapons.  Other 
<br>senior Israeli officials echo this, cautioning that Tehran's 
<br>nuclear weapons program poses what Mossad Chief Meir Dagan 
<br>calls an "existential threat" that alters the strategic 
<br>balance in the region. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) In a meeting with congressional visitors in December, 
<br>Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz described operation of the 
<br>enrichment cycle as the "point of no return" for the Iranian 
<br>program, a view shared by many senior GOI officials.  Mossad 
<br>Chief Dagan went a step further, saying that the Iranian 
<br>program will be unstoppable once it no longer requires 
<br>outside assistance to complete the enrichment process.  At 
<br>the technical level, the director for external affairs at the 
<br>Israel Atomic Energy Commission (IAEC) told poloff that the 
<br>critical step would be Iran's operation of a centrifuge 
<br>enrichment cascade. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (S) GOI officials have given different timelines for when 
<br>they believe Iran will have full enrichment capability.  In 
<br>February, PM Sharon told the Secretary that he believes there 
<br>is still time remaining to pressure Iran, but that the window 
<br>of opportunity is closing quickly.  DefMin Mofaz cautioned 
<br>that Iran is "less than one year away," while the head of 
<br>research in military intelligence estimated that Iran would 
<br>reach this point by early 2007.  Technical experts at the 
<br>IAEC predicted that Iran would have enrichment capability 
<br>within six months of the end of the suspension agreement.  A 
<br>few GOI officials admitted informally that these estimates 
<br>need to be taken with caution.  The head of the MFA's 
<br>strategic affairs division recalled that GOI assessments from 
<br>1993 predicted that Iran would possess an atomic bomb by 1998 
<br>at the latest. 
<br> 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br>Focus on Diplomacy and Concern with the EU-3 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (S) In the near term, Israel is focused on maintaining 
<br>diplomatic pressure on Iran to cooperate with the IAEA and 
<br>EU-3.  Sharon defines diplomatic pressure to include UNSC 
<br>sanctions, e.g. on Iran's airlines and trade, as noted below. 
<br> President Katsav has said that Tehran is "very conscious of 
<br>international opinion."  Other MFA and NSC officials point to 
<br>the current suspension and to Iranian reaction to the Mykonos 
<br>case as proof that diplomatic pressure can affect 
<br>decision-making in Tehran. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (S) The Israelis often express disappointment with EU-3 
<br>efforts, but see no real alternative at this time.  PM Sharon 
<br>told reporters on March 10 that Iran uses the negotiations to 
<br>"play for time."  In private, Sharon, his Cabinet, and 
<br>military leaders have all complained that the Europeans are 
<br>"too soft."  Similarly, President Katsav has cautioned that 
<br>Iran will "cheat" on any commitments it makes.  MFA staff 
<br>told poloff that they do not believe that the EU-3 effort 
<br>will be successful in obtaining a permanent suspension or 
<br>that the Europeans will support effective sanctions against 
<br>Iran. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) GOI technical experts said they have been lobbying the 
<br>Europeans and IAEA on several issues.  First, the GOI would 
<br>like a clearer and more detailed listing of all activities 
<br>covered by the suspension, along with timelines for each 
<br>step.  Second, they want more robust verification measures 
<br>and greater focus on Iran's denial of access to IAEA 
<br>inspectors.  Third, the Israelis insist that any final 
<br>agreement must be endorsed by the UNSC to ensure that 
<br>noncompliance will be dealt with at an appropriate level. 
<br>Fourth, Israel is pushing the EU-3 to define benchmarks that 
<br>would signal a failure of the process, and to identify the 
<br>concrete consequences of such failure. 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (C) According to the IAEC, the GOI has urged the Europeans 
<br>to examine bilateral or EU sanctions with small, but 
<br>noticeable, economic impacts.  After telling the press on 
<br>March 10 that "it would probably not be advisable to impose 
<br>an oil embargo on Iran," PM Sharon advocated trade and flight 
<br>restrictions.  Lower-level GOI officials said these steps 
<br>could include restrictions on Iranians studying in Europe, 
<br>limitations on travel by Iranian scientific personnel, and 
<br>suspension of landing privileges for Iranian airlines within 
<br>the EU.  The goal, according to the deputy NSA for foreign 
<br>affairs, is unified pressure from the EU, Russia, and U.S. 
<br>for a "complete, full, verifiable cessation of the fuel cycle 
<br>program."  In the short term, this means a full suspension of 
<br>all enrichment, reprocessing, heavy-water-reactor 
<br>construction, and related R&D activities. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -- 
<br>Israeli Preference for USG and UNSC Involvement 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -- 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C) In light of their uneasiness with EU-3 efforts, the 
<br>Israelis are hoping for robust U.S. involvement and action by 
<br>the UNSC.  PM Sharon has urged the EU-3 to continue its 
<br>efforts, but also stressed the importance of preparing to 
<br>take Iran to the UNSC.  In a meeting with a CoDel on December 
<br>12, DefMin Mofaz pushed for the U.S. to take the lead with 
<br>the Europeans and pursue all diplomatic solutions, including 
<br>sanctions.  President Katsav asked the Secretary not to "wait 
<br>for the Europeans." 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (C) This desire for U.S. activity is amplified by the 
<br>extremely limited options open to Israel on the diplomatic 
<br>front.  The IAEC's director for non-proliferation admitted 
<br>that the GOI sees "little we can do" to increase pressure on 
<br>Iran as long as Tehran abides by the suspension agreement. 
<br>The MFA's office director for the Gulf states said that 
<br>Israel would maintain its low-profile diplomatic activities, 
<br>such as supplying IAEA members with intelligence material 
<br>related to the Iranian program.  She said the MFA believes 
<br>that any overt Israeli pressure would backfire, leading to a 
<br>surge of Arab support for Iran and focusing attention on 
<br>Israel's own nuclear activities. 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (C) Following the recent announcements on Iran by the 
<br>President and the Secretary, several Israeli officials asked 
<br>if the USG is shifting its policy on Iran.  The deputy NSA 
<br>for foreign affairs acknowledged that the U.S. move is 
<br>probably necessary to build international consensus for 
<br>taking Iran to the UNSC.  At the same time, he expressed 
<br>concern that the USG would be influenced by what he called 
<br>the EU's habit of granting concessions to Iran prior to full 
<br>compliance.  Mid-level staffers at the NSC and IAEC were also 
<br>disquieted by U.S. press reports claiming that the USG is 
<br>re-examining its position on Hizballah. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br>The Military Option: Bushehr is not Osirak 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (S) Despite frustrations with diplomatic efforts, Israeli 
<br>officials are understandably reluctant to discuss possible 
<br>military options.  In public, PM Sharon has stressed the 
<br>importance of the "political and economic" track.  During a 
<br>recent discussion with a visiting USG official, IDF Deputy 
<br>Chief of Staff (and CoS-designate) Major General Dani Haloutz 
<br>similarly said "we don't want to go there."  In February, 
<br>President Katsav told the Secretary that "the military option 
<br>is not necessary -- bring the issue to the Security Council." 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (S) Public speculation about possible military strikes 
<br>usually focuses on the differences from the Israeli Air 
<br>Force's attack on Iraq's Osirak reactor in 1981.  In private, 
<br>GOI officials have acknowledged that several factors would 
<br>make any attack against Iran a much more difficult mission. 
<br>A senior military intelligence official told the Embassy that 
<br>the GOI does not know where all of the targets are located 
<br>and said that any attack would only delay, not end, the 
<br>Iranian program.  The MFA's office director for the Gulf 
<br>states noted that potential target sites are well dispersed 
<br>throughout the country, with several located in built-up 
<br>civilian areas.  The IAEC stressed the importance of Russian 
<br>assistance in restraining Iran's nuclear ambitions and said 
<br>that any attack on Bushehr would likely result in Russian 
<br>casualties and endanger Moscow's cooperation. 
<br> 
<br>¶14. (C) MFA contacts said that the distance to the targets 
<br>and the presence of U.S. forces in Iraq and the Gulf raise 
<br>additional complications.  An Israeli assault would 
<br>necessitate prior coordination with coalition forces in Iraq, 
<br>they maintained, leaving the USG open to retaliation 
<br>throughout the Islamic world, especially in Iraq.  MFA and 
<br>NSC officials acknowledged that any attack would also elicit 
<br>a strong response from Arab states and the Palestinians, 
<br>effectively freezing the peace process. 
<br> 
<br>¶15. (C) The Israelis realize that Iran would use any military 
<br>strike as an excuse to cease cooperation with the EU-3 and 
<br>the IAEA.  In addition, the GOI is acutely aware of Iran's 
<br>ability to retaliate, both militarily and through attacks by 
<br>its regional surrogates.  PM Sharon has claimed that 
<br>Hizballah has 11,000 rockets (and possibly UAVs) capable of 
<br>reaching Israel from launching sites in Lebanon.  The MFA's 
<br>office director for the Gulf states said that she believed 
<br>that Iran would retaliate by inciting terrorist groups in 
<br>Israel and the Occupied Territories. 
<br> 
<br>¶16. (C) Current USG, EU-3, and IAEA focus on Iran also 
<br>creates a situation that differs from 1981, when the Israelis 
<br>felt that the international community was ignoring the Iraqi 
<br>threat.  Israelis hope that the others will solve the Iranian 
<br>problem for them, or as Vice PM Shimon Peres has said, "I do 
<br>not think that the matter of Iran needs to be turned into an 
<br>Israeli problem -- it is a matter of concern for the whole 
<br>world." 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -- 
<br>Comment: Diplomatic Solution Preferred, but ... 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -- 
<br> 
<br>¶17. (S) COMMENT: The Israelis are focusing on diplomatic 
<br>channels in the IAEA and EU-3, and appear to have very real 
<br>concerns about the feasibility of military strikes against 
<br>the Iranian nuclear program.  Nevertheless, the GOI has shown 
<br>time and again that it will act militarily if it believes 
<br>that its security is threatened, and the IDF is most 
<br>certainly keeping contingency plans up to date.  The Israeli 
<br>press reported that in February PM Sharon's Security Cabinet 
<br>had given "initial authorization" for an attack on Iran.  The 
<br>press reports cited an unnamed "Israeli security source," who 
<br>claimed that the USG would "authorize" an Israeli attack. 
<br>Post notes that it may not be possible to detect preparations 
<br>for any military strike.  Air defense operations would pose 
<br>nearly perfect cover for civil defense and Air Force 
<br>activities preceding any attack.  Due to both the extreme 
<br>sensitivity of the issue and the GOI's near inability to 
<br>prevent leaks, any attack order would be closely held, 
<br>probably even from many members of PM Sharon's Cabinet. 
<br> 
<br>¶18. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: The GOI knows that we share its 
<br>interest in preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. 
<br>Nevertheless, we should expect continued Israeli lobbying at 
<br>the highest levels urging the USG to ensure that the EU-3 
<br>effort is on track and backed by a solid international front. 
<br> We will also hear Israeli concerns that the U.S. position 
<br>may move toward the EU stance.  At the same time, we should 
<br>recognize that Israeli intelligence briefings will 
<br>understandably focus on worst-case scenarios and may not 
<br>match current USG assessments.
