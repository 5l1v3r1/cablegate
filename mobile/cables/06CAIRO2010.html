<br>SUBJECT: EGYPT: ACTIONS LOUDER THAN WORDS - GAMAL MUBARAK 
<br>AND THE PRESIDENCY 
<br>
<br>Classified by DCM Stuart Jones for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br>
<br>------- 
<br>Summary 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) The public profile of Gamal Mubarak, presidential son 
<br>and rising star in the ruling party, has increased in recent 
<br>months. His appearance in late March on an evening talk show 
<br>and a highly publicized visit to a Cairo slum have fueled 
<br>speculation that an effort to succeed his father is moving 
<br>full speed ahead. The possibility that Gamal might succeed 
<br>his father remains deeply unpopular on the street - a 
<br>sentiment often echoed by commentators in the independent and 
<br>opposition press. Gamal has denied that he harbors 
<br>presidential ambitions, but many believe his actions speak 
<br>louder than his words. The intra-family politics of a Gamal 
<br>succession bid are unclear. Conventional wisdom holds that 
<br>Suzanne Mubarak is her younger son's most ardent booster. 
<br>Gamal's chances are improved by the fact that there are no 
<br>other obvious contenders for the presidency waiting in the 
<br>wings. End summary. 
<br>
<br>------------- 
<br>Burning Issue 
<br>------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) The issue of presidential succession is the hottest 
<br>single issue on Egypt's domestic political scene. Unlike his 
<br>predecessors, President Mubarak has never named a Vice 
<br>President. Mubarak, who began his fifth six year term in 
<br>September 2005, will turn 78 in May. Though he is vigorous 
<br>and healthy, there is general recognition that the actuarial 
<br>tables will catch up with Mubarak sooner or later. 
<br>Speculation that Mubarak was grooming his son Gamal to 
<br>succeed him increased markedly in 2002, when the younger 
<br>Mubarak assumed a prominent leadership post in the ruling 
<br>National Democratic Party (NDP), just two years after Bashar 
<br>al-Asad succeeded his father in Syria. 
<br>
<br>------------- 
<br>Stage Setting 
<br>------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Both Gamal and his father have repeatedly denied that 
<br>there is any plan for a "succession scenario." More 
<br>important than such words, many Egyptians tell us, are the 
<br>actions of Gamal, his father, and others, which appear to be 
<br>setting the stage for the young Mubarak's rise to power. In 
<br>the summer of 2004 and again at the end of 2005, the 
<br>President shuffled his cabinet, replacing "old guard" figures 
<br>with younger, ambitious technocrats, most with direct or 
<br>indirect links to Gamal. In early 2006, a shake-up in the 
<br>ruling NDP promoted Gamal to the post of Assistant 
<br>Secretary-General (co-equal with Zakaria Azmy, the 
<br>
<br>SIPDIS 
<br>President's de-facto Chief of Staff, and old-guard cabinet 
<br>veteran Mufeed Shehab). The party shuffle also brought a 
<br>number of other Gamal allies into key party leadership 
<br>positions, replacing a number of old-guard rival kingmakers, 
<br>including the notorious machine politician Kamal al-Shazly. 
<br>
<br>
<br>------------- 
<br>Settling Down 
<br>------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Gamal's February engagement to the 24 year old 
<br>socialite Khadiga el-Gammal is widely viewed as another step 
<br>on the path to the presidency. In a society where men 
<br>typically marry before their 30th birthday, Gamal's 
<br>bachelorhood has extended into his 40's. Thus Gamal's 
<br>engagement, cynics tell us, was engineered to broaden his 
<br>appeal. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>"Not for Any Other Purpose" 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) On March 28, Gamal paid a visit, camera crews in tow, 
<br>to the slums of Agouza al-Qadima in Giza, just west of 
<br>Central Cairo. Gamal was there, with Housing Minister (and 
<br>ally) Ahmed al-Maghraby, to cut the ribbon on new low income 
<br>housing units prepared by his Future Generation Foundation, a 
<br>development group he founded in 1999, aimed at addressing the 
<br>needs of poor youth. Most political observers regard the 
<br>foundation as a vehicle primarly intended for Gamal's public 
<br>entree onto the political stage. "We came to help and serve 
<br>only - not for any other purpose," Gamal told accompanying 
<br>journalists in Agouza. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Later that evening, Gamal made a rare appearance on a 
<br>talk show on State Channel 1, promoted all day in advance of 
<br>the broadcast and re-aired on March 29. Gamal focused his 
<br>remarks on his work to rejuvenate the NDP and promote reform 
<br>and "new thinking." He denied that he was out of touch with 
<br>the public, asserting that "one enjoys...going down into the 
<br>street and listening to the people." He also asserted that 
<br>he regularly visits the provinces, but usually keeps a low 
<br>profile lest people ascribe ulterior motives. We have 
<br>noticed an uptick of recent Gamal forays outside of Cairo. 
<br>He stood in for his father, grounded in Cairo by a dust 
<br>storm, at the ribbon cutting for an international air show in 
<br>Sharm el Sheikh. Given all the attention, he could have 
<br>easily been mistaken as the head of state himself. 
<br>
<br>-------------- 
<br>Stone Throwers 
<br>-------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) On his alleged presidential ambitions, Gamal told 
<br>Egyptian talk show viewers on March 28 that he had "made 
<br>clear as daylight" that he did not intend to seek the 
<br>presidency and was instead focused on his current efforts to 
<br>promote reform and serve society. These denials have been 
<br>generally disregarded. "He is repackaging himself - if he is 
<br>not interested, why is he going to all this trouble?" 
<br>prominent liberal dissident Saad Eddin Ibrahim recently mused 
<br>to a western journalist. Former Nasser advisor and 
<br>influential writer Mohamed Hassanein Heikal has made 
<br>opposition to Gamal's succession a staple of his regular 
<br>newspaper columns in the independent press. The notion that 
<br>Gamal might succeed his father, Heikal has written, is an 
<br>affront to Egypt's republican principles. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Abdel Halim Qandil, editor of the Nasserist weekly 
<br>Al-Araby (and a co-founder of the Kifaya protest movement), 
<br>was a pioneer of the anti-Gamal movement, authoring in 2003 a 
<br>series of scathing editorials against the alleged plot to 
<br>install Gamal and underlining the public's "universal 
<br>rejection" of the notion. These editorials, many believe, 
<br>were linked to Qandil's brief 2004 abduction and beating by 
<br>still unidentified thugs, who left him bruised and naked on 
<br>the Suez desert highway. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Very publicly resigning from the NDP in early March, 
<br>leading liberal thinker Osama el-Ghazaly Harb told us of his 
<br>disillusionment with the party's reform process, which he 
<br>came to believe was merely a vehicle for Gamal to promote his 
<br>political career. Imprisoned opposition politician Ayman 
<br>Nour and his supporters have repeatedly insisted to us that 
<br>it was his threat to Gamal that led to his political 
<br>destruction. Like Gamal, Nour is 42 years old. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) An article that appeared March 23 in the maverick 
<br>independent paper Al-Dustour attacked Gamal from a new angle. 
<br>With dubious sourcing, the paper alleged that the Egyptian 
<br>brokerage and financial analysis firm EFG-Hermes had 
<br>manipulated the early March drop of the Cairo-Alexandria 
<br>Stock Exchange to the advantage of its partners and clients 
<br>and at the expense of small investors, adding that Gamal 
<br>Mubarak is on the firm's board. The article clearly got 
<br>Gamal's attention: He acknowledged in his talk show 
<br>appearance that he sat on EFG's board, but insisted that his 
<br>work focused on subsidiary companies not traded on the stock 
<br>market. 
<br>
<br>------------- 
<br>An Open Field 
<br>------------- 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Despite the sniping of many Egyptian opinion-leaders, 
<br>and a more general public hostility (echoed by many of our 
<br>contacts) to Gamal's possible presidential succession, there 
<br>are few other obvious contenders for the post. The post of 
<br>Vice President has remained vacant, despite earlier 
<br>speculation that Mubarak might fill it after the 2005 
<br>elections were behind him. Of the 10 candidates who 
<br>contested Mubarak's presidency last fall, Ayman Nour, who 
<br>placed second, lost his parliamentary seat under very 
<br>controversial circumstances and was subsequently convicted of 
<br>forgery and sentenced to a seven year jail term. The 
<br>third-place finisher, Wafd Party candidate No'man Gomaa, was 
<br>arrested for attempted murder and other charges on April 1 
<br>(septel). The other eight candidates, marginal figures to 
<br>begin with, have faded back into nearly total obscurity. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) There are currently almost no other Egyptian 
<br>personalities with the national stature and political capital 
<br>needed to seriously contend for the presidency. One 
<br>exception could be Intelligence Chief Omar Soliman, who 
<br>wields enormous influence over national security policy and 
<br>is known to have the full confidence of Mubarak. Soliman is 
<br>often cited as a potential appointee to the long-vacant Vice 
<br>Presidential post and his profile has grown with his 
<br>well-publicized mediation visits to Israel and the 
<br>Palestinian territories. 
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Another possible exception could be Arab League 
<br>Secretary-General Amr Moussa, who has a high public profile 
<br>
<br>SIPDIS 
<br>and generally receives favorable coverage across the spectrum 
<br>of Egyptian media outlets. Consequently, he enjoys 
<br>considerable street crediblity as a champion of Arab causes. 
<br>However, Moussa has never expressed or even hinted at any 
<br>presidential ambitions and has no Egyptian institutional 
<br>platform from which to spring. Moussa's assumption of 
<br>another five year term as Arab League SYG could be 
<br>alternately interpreted as keeping him "otherwise occupied" 
<br>or "still in the game," with respect to future political 
<br>positions, but he has never offered any hint that he intends 
<br>to wade into Egypt's domestic political scene. 
<br>
<br>----------------- 
<br>All in the Family 
<br>----------------- 
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) The intra-family politics of a Gamal succession bid 
<br>are unclear. Elder son Alaa', well-known to have extensive 
<br>business interests (many of which are privately criticized as 
<br>corrupt and exploitative) keeps a low public profile and has 
<br>never shown any inclination to wade into the political arena. 
<br>(A rare sighting of Alaa' on national TV took place during 
<br>the final game of the Africa Cup championship in late 
<br>February, when he was photographed in the stadium's VIP 
<br>section with Gamal, cheering on Egypt to its 2-1 victory over 
<br>Ivory Coast.) 
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) The President has been careful not to indicate any 
<br>overt support for Gamal, is rarely photographed with him, and 
<br>has on several occasions angrily denied to the media that 
<br>there is any plan for his younger son to succeed him. While 
<br>some have speculated that the President is ambivalent about 
<br>Gamal's political future, he has not stood in the way of the 
<br>rise of his son and his allies through the ranks of the 
<br>ruling NDP, or obstructed his increased public profile. 
<br>Moreover, the President has twice in the past two years 
<br>shuffled his cabinet and replaced "old guard" elements with 
<br>younger technocrats linked to Gamal. While there is little 
<br>public evidence, commonly accepted wisdom in Cairo is that 
<br>First Lady Suzanne Mubarak is Gamal's most ardent political 
<br>patron. Unlike the President, the First Lady is often 
<br>photographed at public events with Gamal, frequently in 
<br>connection with social issues. Her power and influence, many 
<br>argue, are keys to Gamal's viability. Sources tell us that 
<br>she has kept Mubarak pere from naming a Vice President. 
<br>
<br>--------------------- 
<br>Legal Framework Wired 
<br>--------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) The legal/electoral stage, rearranged in 2005 with 
<br>the amendment of Article 76 of the constitution, currently 
<br>guarantees that the ruling NDP, increasingly dominated by 
<br>Gamal and his allies, will retain their lock on the 
<br>presidency. Of all 20 of Egypt's legally recognized parties, 
<br>only the NDP currently meets the conditions as defined in the 
<br>amendment to field a presidential candidate. (The rules set 
<br>forth in the amendment state that only parties holding five 
<br>percent or more of the seats in each of the People's Assembly 
<br>and the Shura Council. The bar is set higher for 
<br>independents, who must obtain endorsements from 65 PA 
<br>members, 25 Shura Council members, and 10 local council 
<br>members from each of at least 14 of the 26 provinces.) While 
<br>voters will have opportunities to change the current makeup 
<br>of the Shura Council in 2007 and 2009, and the People's 
<br>Assembly in 2010, should a presidential transition become 
<br>necessary sooner, there would be no legal or procedural 
<br>hurdles for any NDP candidate to the presidency. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>A Military Stumbling Block? 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶17. (C) A key stumbling block for any effort to bring Gamal 
<br>Mubarak to the presidency could be the military. Each of 
<br>Egypt's three presidents since the republic was established 
<br>in 1952 were drawn from the military's officer corps, and the 
<br>military has historically been the ultimate guarantor of the 
<br>president's rule. Gamal Mubarak did not serve as a military 
<br>officer (and it is not clear whether he ever completed, even 
<br>"on paper," his national military service) and unlike his 
<br>father, can not take the military's support for granted. 
<br>This factor is often cited by our contacts, who believe that 
<br>Soliman, the intelligence chief with a military background, 
<br>would have to figure in any succession scenario for Gamal, if 
<br>only as a transitional figure. Another theory is that some 
<br>other military officer could emerge from obscurity as a 
<br>presidential contender. (Defense Minister Tantawi is 
<br>acknowledged to be frail and without any political ambition.) 
<br>
<br>
<br>------- 
<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶18. (C) Gamal Mubarak's rise in the ruling NDP, his attempts 
<br>to position himself as a "friend of the people," and as the 
<br>national champion of reform and "new thinking," are all 
<br>compelling evidence that his political ambitions are real - 
<br>denials notwithstanding. Despite palpable public hostility 
<br>to his succession, and potential stumbling blocks, the way 
<br>forward for Gamal currently appears open. Gamal and his 
<br>ambitious allies, such as MP and NDP figure Ahmed Ezz and 
<br>economic reform ministers such as Rachid Rachid and Youssef 
<br>Boutrous Ghali, are apparently banking that structural 
<br>improvements to the economy will deliver tangible benefits to 
<br>the masses, and build a support base that extends beyond 
<br>affluent business circles.
