<br>Classified By: ADCM Susan Elliott for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: President Dmitriy Medvedev's high-profile
<br>campaign to modernize Russia appears designed to give Russia
<br>modest, mostly long-term, economic benefits without altering
<br>the basic economic and political structures that Medvedev
<br>inherited from Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. To the chagrin
<br>of some experts close to the President, the proposed changes
<br>are tactical in nature. If specific measures in Medvedev's
<br>agenda like enforcement of the rule of law, decreasing
<br>corruption, increasing transparency, building basic
<br>infrastructure, and protecting intellectual and property
<br>rights could be implemented, broad based growth could take
<br>place. Medvedev's desire to possibly run for re-election may
<br>be partially responsible for his push to modernize Russia
<br>and, unlike Putin, hold officials accountable for their
<br>actions in the aftermath of recent tragedies. Nonetheless,
<br>Medvedev's modernization drive provides US officials another
<br>potential hook for cooperation. End Summary.
<br>
<br>------------------------------------
<br>Modernization Tactical Or Strategic?
<br>------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) Medvedev's ability to change Russia is based upon
<br>his concept of modernization, which he and Putin have
<br>publicly defined in different ways. During his annual
<br>address to the Federal Assembly on November 12, Medvedev
<br>described modernization as a broad change of mindset and
<br>business practices, with the focus on developing medical,
<br>energy, and information technology, space and
<br>telecommunications systems, and increasing energy efficiency.
<br>He described Russia as a multi-party democracy (reftel), and
<br>also said that the country needed "comprehensive
<br>modernization," which would result in a more democratic,
<br>market-oriented, competitive country. Medvedev has continued
<br>publicly to discuss modernization and has met with various
<br>committees, government bodies, and the media to push his
<br>agenda.
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) In his speech to the United Russia Congress on
<br>November 21, Putin emphasized the economic aspects of
<br>modernization and cited Medvedev's five key areas of focus.
<br>He specifically pointed out the need for modernization of
<br>industrial and defense enterprises, ports, and the pension
<br>system. Putin also noted that Medvedev's call to "overcome
<br>chronic backwardness" and raise the level of Russia's overall
<br>development reflected the mood of all of Russian society.
<br>Putin only mentioned modernization twice during his four hour
<br>televised call-in event on December 3, despite numerous
<br>questions about what the Government would do to improve
<br>Russia's economic situation.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Medvedev's tactical measures for achieving success in
<br>the five defined areas could be achieved with minimal
<br>structural changes to the economy. Installing individual gas
<br>meters to promote less-wasteful use of fuel, changing to more
<br>energy efficient light bulbs, studying the effect of
<br>decreasing the number of time zones in Russia, and building
<br>more supercomputers could provide short to medium-term
<br>economic benefits. They would not, however, significantly
<br>change the structure of the economy or the murky political
<br>context in which businessmen and investors operate. Some
<br>contacts with whom we spoke have jumped on terms such as
<br>"comprehensive modernization" to suggest, perhaps
<br>optimistically, that modernization would include wholesale
<br>changes to Russia's economic and political systems.
<br>
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>Some Prospects for Strategic Reform
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Contacts have noted to us that modernization would
<br>lead to some targeted economic improvements, but, with a few
<br>exceptions, have expressed strong doubts about prospects for
<br>systemic reforms. xxxxx said on December 22 that the President might make
<br>some changes on the edges of the political system, but denied
<br>that Medvedev's reforms would have any major impact on
<br>Russia's political structure, which he said had been
<br>painstakingly formed over the last 15 years. Medvedev might
<br>make some significant reforms in Russia's economic structure,
<br>but would have to "non-violently enforce" modernization on
<br>the business elite, who preferred the status quo and who
<br>wanted to avoid making expensive investments.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) xxxxx
<br>
<br>Moscow 00003109 002 of 003
<br>
<br>
<br>told us December 7 that while various groups of elites have
<br>competing views on modernization, it was possible for
<br>Medvedev, with the Government's support, to overcome
<br>bureaucratic inertia and push through broad economic and
<br>political reforms. One key institution for Medvedev was the
<br>Commission on Modernization and Technological Growth of the
<br>Russian Economy, de facto led by First Deputy Presidential
<br>Administration Head Vladislav Surkov. Medvedev, xxxxx
<br>added, wanted to add influential elites to the commission,
<br>and meet with it more often in order to give it authority and
<br>provide an impetus to fulfill his modernization agenda. Some
<br>siloviki, however, such as Rostechnologia's Sergey Chemezov,
<br>have reportedly boycotted the commission.
<br>
<br>-------------------------------------
<br>Modernization's Tactical Significance
<br>-------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Other analysts stated that Medvedev had no chance of
<br>changing the economic or political systems because he did not
<br>have the inclination, power, or buy-in of the bureaucracy to
<br>do so. xxxxx told us December 21 that they see little prospect
<br>for systemic reforms within the President's modernization
<br>agenda. xxxxx said that democratic reforms could be
<br>the spark that helped push through additional large-scale
<br>reforms, but he "unfortunately" did not anticipate Medvedev
<br>making any major improvements in the economic or political
<br>spheres. xxxxx told us that modernization was focused on
<br>economic policies and that Medvedev could make some quality
<br>improvements in the economy. xxxxx agreed, however, that
<br>reforms would have to occur within the current political
<br>system because it was an "illusion" to think that the
<br>President could overhaul the political system.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) xxxxx told us
<br>December 17 that Medvedev, who he half-jokingly characterized
<br>as Putin's Minister of Economics and Assistant on Cadre
<br>Policies, had no chance of modernizing Russia.
<br>Modernization, he added, was unlikely to increase Medvedev's
<br>public standing or his ability to increase his team's power.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Longtime expert on political systems xxxxx said on December
<br>10 that Medvedev was trying to make some tactical changes,
<br>but had no levers to implement systemic reforms. Russian
<br>bureaucracy had watered-down, stalled, or hindered reforms
<br>for hundreds of years, and would be successful in preventing
<br>any broad reforms. xxxxx added that while Medvedev's
<br>reforms sounded nice, the President would never significantly
<br>alter the political system and create a "true" democratic
<br>system. According to xxxxx Medvedev has benefited from the
<br>current political system, and any attempts to change the
<br>system would introduce a level of uncertainty reminiscent of
<br>former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. xxxxx also noted that the bureaucracy feared losing
<br>their privileges and would fight change through bureaucratic
<br>measures.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) xxxxx Public Chamber member, xxxxx bluntly stated to
<br>us December 9 that the President was not able to reform the
<br>political system. Medvedev could not implement his
<br>modernization agenda, which xxxxx saw as a positive
<br>program for Russia, because the President lacked the levers
<br>to make systemic reforms, and because of bureaucratic
<br>opposition. xxxxx characterized Medvedev as a
<br>"Manilov," in reference to 19th century author Nikolay
<br>Gogol's fictional character Manilov, who was known, as they
<br>described, for devising grand schemes, but failing to ever
<br>implement them.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---------
<br>Modernization Only One Part of Medvedev's Future Plans
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---------
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) With Russia's presidential campaign season
<br>unofficially starting in about a year, many people with whom
<br>we spoke saw the present as pivotal for Medvedev's future if
<br>he wanted to prove that he could become an independent
<br>political leader. xxxxx said that the President needed to
<br>
<br>Moscow 00003109 003 of 003
<br>
<br>
<br>fulfill his promises, such as modernizing the country, to
<br>show all Russians that he can be relied upon to get things
<br>done. xxxxx said that the key question was when the tandem
<br>would divide, and that modernization was only one part of
<br>Medvedev's case to maintain the reins of power. The
<br>President had made other steps that differentiate his style
<br>from Putin's, such as holding senior regional officials
<br>responsible for their duties in the wake of the club fire in
<br>Perm that killed 150 people and the death of lawyer Sergey
<br>Magnitsky while in pre-trial detention, that might elevate
<br>his case.
<br>
<br>-------
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Modernization may not facilitate the structural
<br>changes to the political and economic spheres that some
<br>experts had hoped, but it could be another tool for Medvedev
<br>to demonstrate his leadership and, depending on his
<br>implementation and governing skills, introduce some
<br>uncertainty into the public and elite over his standing.
<br>Medvedev is finally challenging the low expectations and
<br>assessments of many experts after 19 months in office as
<br>Putin's junior partner. Medvedev has also refrained from
<br>challenging Putin's authority, control over day-to-day
<br>economic matters, or respect with the public and siloviki.
<br>Few currently doubt that the tandem member who will occupy
<br>the presidency in 2012 remains Putin's decision, but as the
<br>presidential campaign season approaches the risks and rewards
<br>for deviating from the tandem's stable relationship
<br>substantially increases for significant groups of elites with
<br>an interest in succession politics.
