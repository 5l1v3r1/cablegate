<br>SUBJECT: KOSOVO: STRATEGY FOR NORTHERN KOSOVO AN IMPORTANT 
<br>STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Christopher W. Dell for Reasons 1.4 (b), (d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Phil - I know that you are seeing Robert Cooper on 
<br>Tuesday, February 2, among other things, to discuss Kosovo 
<br>and the strategy for northern Kosovo. Integrating Kosovo 
<br>Serbs into Kosovo society and preserving the country's 
<br>territorial integrity is central to Kosovo's and the region's 
<br>long-term stability and has been a core U.S. policy objective 
<br>since 1999. In November 2009, we had a breakthrough that 
<br>ended ten years of Belgrade-imposed stalemate when thousands 
<br>of Serbs in southern Kosovo took part in Kosovo municipal 
<br>elections. We want to replicate that success in the north 
<br>and end the stalemate that has left Kosovo's future 
<br>uncertain. That fundamentally is what the so-called northern 
<br>strategy is about. We want to coax the population into 
<br>greater cooperation with Pristina, not to impose outcomes on 
<br>them. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Currently, we have a growing, if still somewhat 
<br>fragile, consensus within the international community in 
<br>Pristina that the time is right to end the years of drift on 
<br>the north and to alter the dynamic of a hardening partition 
<br>between the north and the rest of Kosovo. In part, this is 
<br>sparked by the new willingness among Kosovo Serbs to engage 
<br>with Kosovo institutions. It also stems from Belgrade's 
<br>increasingly aggressive actions in the north (e.g., seizure 
<br>of the Valac electrical substation; unilateral appointment of 
<br>Serb judges to illegal parallel courts) that have underscored 
<br>to representatives of the international community on the 
<br>ground the risks of continuing to do nothing. For ten years, 
<br>we told the Kosovars to trust us -- "let us handle the 
<br>situation, and we will protect you" -- and now the government 
<br>of independent Kosovo is increasingly asking us when we are 
<br>going to make good on that commitment. KFOR is drawing down 
<br>(in six months NATO could take a decision to cut its forces 
<br>in half). We need to take advantage of a unique opportunity 
<br>that has crystallized and act now while we still have a KFOR 
<br>presence capable of handling any contingency. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Belgrade has reacted vehemently to the northern 
<br>strategy. I think this intensity is rooted in the concern 
<br>that any positive momentum in the north will undermine 
<br>Belgrade's likely post-ICJ strategy: push to reopen status 
<br>talks and formalize the emerging de facto partition of 
<br>Kosovo. Furthermore, Belgrade has shrewdly judged that 
<br>raising the specter of confrontation rattles our EU partners 
<br>and is an effective tactic for derailing the strategy 
<br>altogether. Cooper will likely reflect this anxiety with 
<br>you, but I do not sense that this concern is nearly as strong 
<br>within the local Quint (with the exception of Italian 
<br>Ambassador Michael Giffoni, who spent ten years on Javier 
<br>Solana's staff, where the Brussels bureaucrats have long been 
<br>anxious about taking any difficult decision on the north). 
<br>With this in mind, I recommend that you stress three points 
<br>with Cooper. First, the northern strategy is not radical. 
<br>Much of it restates what the international community, in 
<br>general, and the EU, in particular, are already committed to 
<br>doing. Second, it provides a vehicle for constructively 
<br>channeling the GOK's ambitions for the north and takes 
<br>advantage of Prime Minister Hashim Thaci's readiness to offer 
<br>inducements to northern Serbs who engage with Kosovo 
<br>institutions. Third, we now have legitimate Serb partners 
<br>(elected by fellow Serbs) who are ready to help us in the 
<br>north. These are the elements of a soft approach, which is 
<br>the northern strategy's leading edge. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) We should expect Belgrade to challenge all elements of 
<br>the strategy and to misportray the strategy as hard and 
<br>confrontational. Serbian Ministry for Kosovo State Secretary 
<br>Oliver Ivanovic has already declared that Pristina is 
<br>promoting conflict. This is not the case. There is no 
<br>interest here in conflict (not among the Quint and the ICO, 
<br>nor within the GOK), but the current situation is untenable 
<br>and deteriorating. The aim is to stop the rot in the north 
<br>and create the positive momentum there that we need to secure 
<br>our long-term policy objectives: a secure and stable Kosovo 
<br>and a Serbia focused on its EU future, not old ambitions and 
<br>grievances. We need to start the process now, and we should 
<br>not allow Belgrade to use threats of confrontation as a veto 
<br>to block progress. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) You can tell Cooper that the northern strategy offers 
<br>incremental, but fundamental, steps necessary to getting the 
<br>
<br>north right. We know, however, that there will be difficult 
<br>challenges that pose risks. For example, EULEX must get 
<br>serious about rolling up organized crime networks in the 
<br>north that feed the parallel structures and make the current 
<br>situation unsustainable. The northern Serbs are the first 
<br>victims of these thugs, and there is a growing body of 
<br>reports that they would welcome a change if EULEX can deliver 
<br>it. We must, also, deal with the blatant theft of Kosovo 
<br>property that has allowed Serbia to, in effect, seize the 
<br>northern power grid in Kosovo. Dealing with these issues 
<br>will require hard choices and fortitude. Our message to 
<br>Cooper should be that we want to coordinate and consult with 
<br>Brussels every step of the way. This process, after all, 
<br>only works if Brussels makes clear to Belgrade that its EU 
<br>future depends on real cooperation on Kosovo. In recent 
<br>meetings with Boris Tadic, both Angela Merkel and Nicolas 
<br>Sarkozy reportedly emphasized that Serbia's path to Brussels 
<br>runs, in part, through constructive relations with Pristina. 
<br>This is the perfect message. Brussels needs to repeat it -- 
<br>regularly. We, of course, are also ready to consult with 
<br>Belgrade, as well, and to offer them the opportunity to 
<br>engage constructively. Where we part company with some 
<br>within the EU, however, is in not being willing to accept 
<br>that we must have Belgrade's agreement before taking any 
<br>steps. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) I need to emphasize the importance of this moment. 
<br>Failure to act soon means losing northern Kosovo and will 
<br>re-open the Pandora's Box of ethnic conflict that defined the 
<br>1990s. Fortunately, our European partners increasingly 
<br>recognize this. My British colleague here confirms what Stu 
<br>has also heard -- that there is a greater degree of 
<br>commitment and resolve in member capitals than may be the 
<br>case in the Commission and the Council officialdom in 
<br>Brussels. Even there, though, initial anxieties over the 
<br>strategy appear to be easing as they look more carefully at 
<br>the content and less at the rhetoric.
