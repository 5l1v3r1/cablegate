<br>for reasons 1.4 (b), (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (U) This is an action request. Please see
<br>Paragraph 7.
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) Background/Objective: Since November 2005, we have
<br>discussed with German officials efforts by Iran's solid
<br>propellant missile developer - the Shahid Bakeri Industrial
<br>Group (SBIG) - to procure environmental test chambers from
<br>the German firm xxxxxxxxxxxx (Refs).
<br>SBIG has conducted its dealings with xxxxxxxxxxxx through the
<br>Iranian intermediary xxxxxxxxxxxx Ltd. and the missile-related front
<br>companies xxxxxxxxxxxx, and xxxxxxxxxxxx.
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) In April 2006, Germany denied a request by xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>to export environmental chambers to xxxxxxxxxxxx (Ref K). This
<br>denial came shortly after having been alerted by the USG to
<br>SBIG's use of xxxxxxxxxxxx as a front company (Refs E & G). Germany
<br>has also sensitized xxxxxxxxxxxx GmbH - the
<br>manufacturer of the test chamber - to its concerns about this
<br>case (Ref P).
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) In June 2007, we alerted the FRG that xxxxxxxxxxxx - in
<br>a further attempt to evade German export controls - in
<br>mid-March 2007 suggested to xxxxxxxxxxxx that a thermal shock
<br>chamber be shipped to Iran using Croatian, Romanian or
<br>Russian intermediaries (Ref M). We subsequently advised
<br>German officials that in late May 2007, the Croatian firm
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx made an offer to xxxxxxxxxxxx - on behalf of xxxxxxxxxxxx -
<br>for the sale of a shock chamber (Ref O).
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) We now have information indicating that as of
<br>mid-December 2007, xxxxxxxxxxxx had
<br>discussed routing the shock chamber through xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>in the United Arab Emirates. xxxxxxxxxxxx and
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx apparently agreed to falsely list an entity in
<br>Tajikistan as the end-user, but xxxxxxxxxxxx would actually
<br>forward the chamber directly from the UAE to Iran. xxxxxxxxxxxx also
<br>requested an inspection and training course in Germany for
<br>two or three engineers prior to the machine's shipment to
<br>Iran.
<br>
<br>¶6. (S) Objective: We want to share this most recent
<br>information with FRG officials, and encourage them to
<br>continue their work to prevent xxxxxxxxxxxx from supplying
<br>Iran's solid-fueled ballistic missile program with shock
<br>chambers.
<br>
<br>¶7. (U) Action Request: Department requests Embassy
<br>Berlin approach appropriate host government officials
<br>to deliver the talking points in Paragraph 8 and report
<br>response. Talking points may be left as a non-paper.
<br>
<br>¶8. (S) Begin talking points/non-paper:
<br>
<br>(secret//rel germany)
<br>
<br>-- Since November 2005, we have been discussing with you
<br>efforts by Iran's xxxxxxxxxxxx to procure environmental test
<br>chambers from the German firm xxxxxxxxxxxx on
<br>behalf of Iran's missile program.
<br>
<br>-- In early June 2007, we shared information with you
<br>indicating that in mid-March 2007, xxxxxxxxxxxx was working
<br>with xxxxxxxxxxxx to provide a 2-zone thermal shock chamber type xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>to Iran's xxxxxxxxxxxx, an entity
<br>associated with the Shahid Bakeri Industrial Group (SBIG),
<br>Iran's primary developer of solid-fueled ballistic missiles.
<br>
<br>-- As we advised you in June,xxxxxxxxxxxx representatives
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx and xxxxxxxxxxxx had suggested to
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx that the shipment be routed through Croatia, Romania,
<br>or Russia in order to disguise the fact that the actual
<br>end-user is in Iran.
<br>
<br>-- You will also recall from our subsequent discussions in
<br>August that Croatia's xxxxxxxxxxxx had made a late-May
<br>offer to xxxxxxxxxxxx - on behalf of xxxxxxxxxxxx - for the sale of
<br>the shock chamber, and that xxxxxxxxxxxx had developed plans
<br>to ship the chamber to Croatia, where xxxxxxxxxxxx would act as an
<br>intermediary and forward the equipment to Iran.
<br>
<br>-- We now have information indicating that as of December
<br>2007,xxxxxxxxxxxx and xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>continued their discussions related to the purchase by xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>of a thermal shock chamber on behalf of Iran's solid-fueled
<br>ballistic missile program.
<br>
<br>-- Specifically, we understand that xxxxxxxxxxxx and xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>have discussed shipping the test chamber to xxxxxxxxxxxx in the United Arab Emirates.
<br>
<br>-- xxxxxxxxxxxx appear to have agreed to falsely list
<br>an entity in Tajikistan as the end-user, but xxxxxxxxxxxx would
<br>actually forward the chamber directly from the UAE to Iran.
<br>
<br>-- The test chamber is to be shipped within two to three
<br>months after an advance payment has been made. We do not
<br>know if any such payment has yet occurred.
<br>
<br>-- We also understand that xxxxxxxxxxxx requested an inspection and
<br>training course in Germany for two or three engineers prior
<br>to the machine's shipment to Iran.
<br>
<br>-- We are grateful for your continued cooperation on this
<br>case, and for measures you have taken in the past to prevent
<br>the shipment of this equipment to Iran.
<br>
<br>-- We will continue to provide you with relevant information
<br>on this issue as it becomes available, and look forward to
<br>hearing of any actions your government takes in response to
<br>this information.
<br>
<br>End talking points/non-paper.
<br>
<br>¶9. (U) Please contact ISN/MTR's John Paul Herrmann with any
<br>questions or follow-up related to this case (202-647-1430 -
<br>herrmannjp2@state.gov or herrmannjp@state.sgov.gov) and slug
<br>reporting on this issue for ISN/MTR, EUR/AGS and EUR/PRA.
<br>
<br>¶10. (U) A word version of this document will be posted at
<br>www.state.sgov.gov/demarche.
