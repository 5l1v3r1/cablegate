<br>TAGS: PREL PGOV MARR GG RS
<br>SUBJECT: TFGGO1: RUSSIA-SOUTH OSSETIA SITREP 2 AUGUST 9 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Charge d'Affaires Eric S. Rubin. Reasons 1.4(b) and (d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary. U.S. demarche will be delivered to the
<br>Russian MFA at 1400 Moscow time (0600 EDT). The Russian
<br>government continues to characterize its actions as "peace
<br>enforcement," with Russian media claiming that troops have
<br>reached Tskhinvali's outskirts. Officials emphasize they
<br>have a responsibility to protect the local populace and
<br>stress that they will take all necessary actions to deal with
<br>the humanitarian situation. Local press has been covering
<br>the conflict extensively, showing convoys of Russian tanks,
<br>and interviews with persons who have fled their homes in
<br>South Ossetia for North Ossetia. Russia's political parties
<br>and populace have acclaimed Russia's actions, with the
<br>Communists and nationalist Zhirinovskiy pressing for a harder
<br>line. The lackluster performance of Medvedev has raised
<br>questions, but the fact Putin has not returned from Beijing
<br>and is shown talking to Olympic athletes indicate he is
<br>content to let Medvedev handle the situation (for public
<br>consumption, at least). Some commentators are questioning
<br>whether the U.S. gave Georgia the go-ahead, and say the GOR
<br>is awaiting the U.S. reaction. End summary.
<br>
<br>DFM Karasin Not Available
<br>-------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) MFA informed Embassy Moscow that DFM Karasin was not
<br>available to meet with Charge today. The French Embassy got
<br>the same message this morning when it requested an
<br>appointment to deliver an EU demarche paralleling ours.
<br>Acting DCM will deliver our demarche to MFA at the
<br>directorate level at 14:00 Moscow time.
<br>
<br>Medvedev Steps Forward, Hesitantly
<br>----------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) A pale and hesitant Medvedev, with none of the
<br>bravado of Putin, was pushed forward into the limelight on
<br>Saturday morning, with televised coverage of his opening
<br>remarks following a meeting with Defense Minister Serdyukov
<br>and the Chief of the General Staff Makarov. Medvedev
<br>reiterated to the military leadership that the Russian
<br>peacekeepers and additional units were entrusted with
<br>bringing the Georgian side to peace, with the responsibility
<br>for protecting the local population. Medvedev then met with
<br>officials from the Ministry for Emergency Services, as well
<br>as Health and Social Services, to underscore that Russia
<br>would take all steps necessary to deal with the difficult
<br>humanitarian situation that had been brought out by Georgian
<br>military actions. Reiterating that it was Russia's
<br>obligation to resolve the crisis situation and assist the
<br>civilians, Medvedev entrusted the Russian officials with
<br>overseeing the complex of issues associated with the
<br>"humanitarian response." Press reports note the pro
<br>vision of a mobile hospital facilities among the assistance,
<br>with a hot-line established for families to find out
<br>information about friends and relatives in the conflict area.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Medvedev's performance has been lackluster, with
<br>potential implications for his longevity in office. That
<br>said, we do not see divisions in the leadership, with
<br>prominent foreign policy experts reinforcing to us the
<br>consensus that undergirds Russia's policy towards Georgia.
<br>The fact that Putin has not come rushing home from Beijing to
<br>help manage the crisis in Moscow reflects his confidence that
<br>the policy course is not in doubt. Medvedev's efforts to
<br>frame Russian actions in legal terms, as an obligation to
<br>assist Russian peacekeepers, who are present in the conflict
<br>zone under international agreement, reflects his lawyerly
<br>bent and perhaps his inclination to keep this conflict
<br>focused on the restoration of status quo ante.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) xxxxx said the key question the GOR was
<br>trying to determine was whether the U.S. had given
<br>Saakashvili the go-ahead. The GOR had expected the U.S. to
<br>again convince Georgia to pull back and when that didn't
<br>happen, it raised the question whether the U.S. had allowed
<br>Georgia to go ahead. The GOR was questioning whether this
<br>was a first step in the U.S.'s attempt to isolate or contain
<br>Russia, and were waiting for America's reaction and
<br>intentions.
<br>
<br>Russia's Conception of "Status Quo Ante?"
<br>-----------------------------------------
<br>¶6. (SBU) In a phone call with German President Merkel,
<br>President Medvedev insisted that returning to the status quo
<br>ante would entail Georgian troops returning to their "initial
<br>positions." This likely supports Foreign Minister Lavrov's
<br>emphasis on a Georgian withdrawal from the current zone of
<br>conflict, a point he made in numerous calls with foreign
<br>counterparts. What remains unclear is whether a return to
<br>"initial positions" refers to the positioning of Georgian
<br>forces immediately before the outbreak of violence on
<br>Thursday, or an adherence to the terms of the 1994 Cease-fire
<br>Agreement. Although Russian officials have yet to cite the
<br>1994 Agreement as a condition for status quo ante, Medvedev
<br>has announced the need for a legally binding, "non-use of
<br>force" agreement. Russia has repeatedly called on Georgia
<br>to sign such an agreement.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) The status quo ante could become a moot point if
<br>Russia throws its support behind South Ossetian independence.
<br>While the Kremlin and the Government have largely stayed
<br>silent on recognizing South Ossetia's independence,
<br>Federation Council Speaker Mironov said the FC would examine
<br>this issue in the near future. We believe Mironov's comments
<br>are parliamentary bluster.
<br>
<br>President Medvedev Orders Aid to Fleeing South Ossetians
<br>--------------------------------------------- -----------
<br>
<br>¶8. (U) Russians remain fixated with the scope of
<br>Georgian-inflicted casualties. Hourly news bulletins on all
<br>channels are showing tearful refugees telling tales of terror
<br>and flight. On August 8, head of the South Ossetia
<br>information department in the Joint Control Commission (JCC)
<br>told Interfax that the Georgians shot at residential areas
<br>and a hospital. He said, "All business and organizations are
<br>on fire: schools, the university, the Culture Ministry, the
<br>parliament. The peacekeeper's city has been destroyed."
<br>South Ossetia leader Eduard Kokoity estimated the number of
<br>dead at 1,400. Vice Premier Sergey Sobyanin announced that
<br>Russia has accepted more than 30,000 refugees from South
<br>Ossetia. South Ossetia's entire population is estimated at
<br>70,000 people. UNHCR tells us it continues to closely follow
<br>the situation in South Ossetia. The Federal Migration
<br>Service had told their office to expect thousands of refugees
<br>and IDPs, but she questioned the 30,000 figure reported in
<br>the Russian media.
<br>
<br>¶9. (U) On August 9, President Medvedev ordered the Emergency
<br>Situations Ministry, the Health and Social Development
<br>Ministry, and the Federal Migration Service to address the
<br>"very complicated humanitarian problems have arisen, which we
<br>need to address in line with our mandate and simply in line
<br>with the duty that our state has." Medvedev stressed that, "
<br>the people responsible for this humanitarian disaster need to
<br>be held liable for what they have done, considering, among
<br>other, the international legal aspect of this problem."
<br>Emergency Situations Ministry spokeswoman Irina Andrianova
<br>said that 19 provisional centers for the refugees are
<br>operating in North Ossetia and a Ministry airmobile hospital
<br>has been deployed to the region. News reports also said that
<br>most South Ossetians are staying with relatives in North
<br>Ossetia, and that Russia's Rostov region is preparing to
<br>accommodate thousands of South Ossetians.
<br>
<br>Criminal Case Opened to Investigation Peacekeeper Losses
<br>--------------------------------------------- -----------
<br>
<br>¶10. (U) By August 9 midday, Russian news agencies reported 15
<br>Russian peacekeepers had been killed and over 50 were
<br>injured. The spokesman of Russia's Office of the Chief
<br>Military Prosecutor announced the launch of a criminal
<br>investigation into the peacekeeper's deaths, comprised of 30
<br>investigators and headed by a deputy chief military
<br>prosecutor.
