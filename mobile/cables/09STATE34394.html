<br>
<br>¶1. (U) March 20, 2009, 12:30p.m., Washington, DC.

<br>¶3. (C) Summary: Deputy Secretary Steinberg met March 20 with 
<br>Brazilian Ambassador Antonio Patriota to follow-up on the 
<br>President's March 14 meeting with Brazilian President Luiz 
<br>Inacio Lula da Silva. Patriota pushed for further 
<br>coordination on G-20 and Summit of the Americas outcomes, 
<br>raised concerns with a draft EPA rule Brazil believes will 
<br>adversely affect trade in biofuels, and asked that we resume 
<br>our strategic dialogues on Africa and the Middle East. End 
<br>Summary. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- -- 
<br>Coordination on G-20 and Summit of the Americas 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Following on a suggestion of both Presidents during 
<br>their March 14 meeting, Patriota proposed the Secretary and 
<br>Brazilian Foreign Minister Amorim meet to discuss Summit of 
<br>the Americas outcomes on April 1 or 2 just prior to the G-20 
<br>summit in London. He noted the Brazilian G-20 sherpa met 
<br>with his U.S. counterpart in Washington on March 16, and will 
<br>return shortly to meet with Treasury Department officials. 
<br>Steinberg described the U.S. ambition to bring a strong human 
<br>dimension to the Summit of the Americas by keeping the focus 
<br>on issues like addressing inequality and poverty. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>EPA Rule-making on Biofuels 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Brazil is concerned an EPA draft rule on the 
<br>classification of Brazilian ethanol will sharply curtail 
<br>trade in biofuels and deal a severe political blow to our 
<br>bilateral biofuels cooperation. The GOB believes the EPA 
<br>process is politically motivated, and would like an 
<br>opportunity for Brazilian scientists to present 
<br>counter-arguments. 
<br>
<br>---------------- 
<br>Venezuela, Haiti 
<br>---------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Following on a request POTUS made of President Lula 
<br>during their March 14 meeting, Patriota said the Government 
<br>of Brazil had approached Caracas on Venezuelan reticence to 
<br>grant visas for U.S. diplomats. Without providing specifics, 
<br>Patriota indicated "there seems to be cause for some 
<br>optimism" on the subject. Turning to Haiti, Patriota 
<br>indicated the GOB is eager coordinate with WHA ahead of the 
<br>April Haiti Donors' Conference in mid-April. Steinberg noted 
<br>the our interest in improving the situation in Haiti, and 
<br>welcomed Brazil's engagement. 
<br>
<br>-------------------------- 
<br>Other High-Level Dialogues 
<br>-------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) The Government of Brazil has named a new U/S for 
<br>Political Affairs (Note: Vera Machado), and Patriota asked 
<br>that we resume our P-level strategic dialogue as soon as 
<br>possible. The GOB also want to resume our Assistant 
<br>Secretary-level dialogues on Africa and Middle East, when 
<br>appropriate personnel are in place. Deputy Foreign Minister 
<br>Samuel Guimaraes, who has not visited the United States 
<br>during his six years in the number two position in the 
<br>foreign ministry, has asked to meet with Deputy Secretary 
<br>Steinberg, which the Deputy welcomed.
