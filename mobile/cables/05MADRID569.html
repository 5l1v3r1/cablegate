<br>SUBJECT: ZAPATERO VENEZUELA POLICY PERPLEXES SPANISH MFA
<br>OFFICIALS
<br>
<br>REF: STATE 25063
<br>
<br>Classified By: Political Counselor Kathleen M. Fitzpatrick,
<br>reasons 1.4(b) and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: The Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs'
<br>chief official for Andean countries informed poloff February
<br>9 that a majority of officials at the MFA are as perplexed as
<br>the U.S. is at President Jose Luis Rodriquez Zapatero's
<br>policy of building closer relations with Venezuela's Hugo
<br>Chavez. Juan Carlos Sanchez (please protect) explained
<br>Zapatero's Venezuela policy is being run from Moncloa and the
<br>MFA is left to try to influence the policy as much as
<br>possible. Most MFA officials, according to Sanchez, see no
<br>benefits and only downsides for Spain in closer relations
<br>with Venezuela. They understand Zapatero's moves do not work
<br>to promote democracy or stability in the region and will only
<br>serve to further strain relations with the U.S., Colombia and
<br>other countries in the region. End summary.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Poloff met February 9 with Sanchez, the MFA's Deputy
<br>Director General for the Andean Community (DAS-equivalent) to
<br>discuss Spain's policy toward Venezuela and Colombia.
<br>(Sanchez replaced Ernesto de Zulueta as the Andean DDG in
<br>December 2004). Poloff began the meeting telling Sanchez
<br>that in general the U.S. was extremely perplexed at Spain's
<br>developing relationship with Venezuela and Hugo Chavez, and
<br>believed the Spanish government was on the wrong side of the
<br>equation in terms of promoting democracy in the region and
<br>avoiding conflicts between Venezuela and Colombia.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) In a surprisingly frank reply, Sanchez (please
<br>protect) said he and "the great majority" of his colleagues
<br>in the Foreign Ministry were "equally perplexed" at
<br>Zapatero's moves to build closer relations with Chavez. He
<br>specifically noted (again, please protect) that more senior
<br>officials involved with Latin American affairs at the MFA
<br>share this view. Sanchez, who has served in Caracas,
<br>explained that neither he nor many others in the MFA saw any
<br>benefit accruing to Spain from Zapatero's policy, rather
<br>quite the opposite: Zapatero's cozying up to Chavez will
<br>only needlessly anger the United States and Colombia. "We
<br>don't understand the policy or the reason for it," remarked
<br>Sanchez.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) On Zapatero's canceling of a planned stop in Caracas
<br>during his recent visit to South America, Sanchez said the
<br>MFA strongly urged Zapatero not to make the stop, believing
<br>it would be a serious mistake, but in the end it was
<br>Colombian President Alvaro Uribe's direct intervention with
<br>Zapatero (somewhat heated, according to Sanchez) that
<br>ultimately led Zapatero to cancel the stop. Sanchez said he
<br>and his MFA colleagues were at a loss to explain why Zapatero
<br>then "secretly" sent Minister of Defense Bono to Caracas. If
<br>the purpose of the visit was to lobby Chavez to purchase
<br>military ships from Spain's ailing Izar shipyards, the
<br>prevailing view at the MFA is that placating, probably only
<br>temporarily, Izar's agitated ship workers was not worth
<br>damaging Spain's relations with the U.S., Colombia and
<br>others.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Moreover, Sanchez emphasized, selling any kind of
<br>armaments to Venezuela at this time "makes no sense at all,"
<br>particularly in light of the Zapatero government's decision
<br>in 2004 to cancel the sale of "a few second or third hand
<br>tanks" to Colombia, purportedly because Madrid was concerned
<br>the sale could upset the military balance between Venezuela
<br>and Colombia. "If Bono had justified canceling the sale
<br>based on the idea that tanks are not well suited to fighting
<br>an insurgency, that would be one thing," said Sanchez, "but
<br>having canceled the sale supposedly to avoid tipping the
<br>military balance in the region, we at the MFA understand how
<br>incongruous discussions with Venezuela about purchasing
<br>armaments from Spain now look."
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Sanchez said that Venezuela policy is being run out
<br>of Moncloa (the presidency) and that the MFA is left trying
<br>to influence the policy as much as possible. "The MFA wants
<br>relations with the U.S. repaired, not further damaged by a
<br>policy of building closer relations to Hugo Chavez, which
<br>produces no tangible benefits for Spain," said Sanchez. The
<br>MFA understands the U.S. also strongly disagrees with Spain's
<br>Cuba policy, but the MFA feels it can articulate a reasonable
<br>basis for the Zapatero government's position on Cuba. "There
<br>is no reasonable basis for our Venezuela policy," said
<br>Sanchez. The MFA understands Spain should be on the right
<br>side of democracy and regional security, and that Venezuela
<br>is going in the wrong direction. The MFA is doing its best
<br>to persuade Moncloa of this.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Poloff said the U.S. strongly urges Zapatero not to
<br>visit Caracas in March as we understand he is tentatively
<br>planning to do. Sanchez replied that the MFA understands the
<br>U.S. position and is seeking to postpone the visit. At a
<br>minimum, the MFA wants to see Zapatero visit Bogota on the
<br>same trip if Zapatero does go to Caracas in March.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Poloff's conversation with Sanchez took place before
<br>we received reftel concerning Venezuelan attempts to purchase
<br>certain armaments. We will follow up with both the MFA and
<br>Moncloa on the arms question, and more generally on further
<br>developments in the Zapatero government's evolving policy
<br>toward Venezuela.
