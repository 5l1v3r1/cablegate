<br>SUBJECT: DEMARCHE RESPONSE: SPAIN UNLIKELY TO GO AFTER
<br>NICARAGUA ON RECOGNITIONS
<br>
<br>REF: STATE 96677
<br>
<br>Classified By: DCM Arnold Chacon, for reasons 1.4(b) and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Poloff conveyed concerns per reftel and asked that
<br>Spain consider speaking out against Nicaraguan President
<br>Ortega's September 2 decision to recognize the independence
<br>of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Spanish MFA Sub-Director
<br>General for Mexico, Central America and The Caribbean Jorge
<br>Romeu told poloff September 16 that although he and his
<br>colleagues had discussed Ortega's announcement during
<br>coordination meetings, his impression was that Spain would
<br>not be proactive in addressing it. Overall, Romeu was
<br>skeptical of the positive outcome of demarching the GON,
<br>saying he knew the response would reference Kosovo. Reacting
<br>subsequently to if raised points regarding Kosovo, he noted
<br>Russia might say the same, that its recognition of the two
<br>republics was a "special case" that should not be viewed as a
<br>precedent, either. He added that the comparisons did not
<br>affect Spain anyway, because the GOS has yet to recognize
<br>Kosovo.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Romeu deferred to the expertise of his colleagues who
<br>cover Eastern Europe and suggested the Spanish were more
<br>likely to act within the EU framework than bilaterally. He
<br>described a Danish proposal to carry out a demarche
<br>expressing the EU's "surprise" and "regret," and said he
<br>sympathized with the reluctance on the part of EU partners to
<br>speak out in those terms. Saying some within the EU had
<br>suggested ending cooperation with Nicaragua altogether over
<br>this and other of Ortega's actions, Romeu cautioned that
<br>Spain -- at the level of the Director General for Foreign
<br>Policy -- would only consider demarching Nicaragua in an
<br>"appropriate context," reshaping terms and perhaps
<br>considering an "explanatory demarche" rather than a
<br>derogatory one. After all, Romeu said, Ortega is "a mad
<br>man."
