<br>     ¶B. 08 STATE 122706--19/NOV/2008 
<br>     ¶C. 04 STATE 101403--06/MAY/2004 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: SUZANNE MCCORMICK, DIRECTOR, INR/OPS,  REASON: 1.4(C). 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (S/NF) This cable provides the full text of the new 
<br>National HUMINT Collection Directive (NHCD) on African Great 
<br>Lakes (paragraph 3-end) as well as a request for continued 
<br>DOS reporting of biographic information relating to DROC, 
<br>Burundi, and Rwanda (paragraph 2). 
<br> 
<br>¶A. (S/NF) The NHCD below supersedes the NHCD contained in Ref 
<br>C and reflects the results of a recent Washington review of 
<br>reporting and collection needs announced in Ref B focused on 
<br>African Great Lakes.  The review produced a comprehensive 
<br>list of strategic priorities (paragraph 3) and reporting and 
<br>collection needs (paragraph 4) intended to guide 
<br>participating USG agencies as they allocate resources and 
<br>update plans to collect information on African Great Lakes. 
<br>We thank Kigali for its Ref A input.  The priorities should 
<br>also serve as a useful tool to help the Embassy manage 
<br>reporting and collection, including formulation of Mission 
<br>Strategic Plans (MSPs). 
<br> 
<br>¶B. (S/NF) This NHCD is compliant with the National 
<br>Intelligence Priorities Framework (NIPF), which was 
<br>established in response to NSPD-26 of February 24, 2003.  If 
<br>needed, GRPO can provide further background on the NIPF and 
<br>the use of NIPF abbreviations (shown in parentheses following 
<br>each sub-issue below) in NHCDs. 
<br> 
<br>¶C. (S/NF) Important information often is available to 
<br>non-State members of the Country Team whose agencies 
<br>participated in the review of this National HUMINT Collection 
<br>Directive.  COMs, DCMs, and State reporting officers can 
<br>assist by coordinating with other Country Team members to 
<br>encourage relevant reporting through their own or State 
<br>Department channels.  We appreciate Ref A response from 
<br>Kigali. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S/NF) State biographic reporting: 
<br> 
<br>¶A. (S/NF) The intelligence community relies on State 
<br>reporting officers for much of the biographical information 
<br>collected worldwide.  Informal biographic reporting via email 
<br>and other means is vital to the community's collection 
<br>efforts and can be sent to the INR/B (Biographic) office for 
<br>dissemination to the IC. 
<br> 
<br>¶B. (S/NF) Reporting officers should include as much of the 
<br>following information as possible when they have information 
<br>relating to persons linked to African Great Lakes: office and 
<br>organizational titles; names, position titles and other 
<br>information on business cards; numbers of telephones, cell 
<br>phones, pagers and faxes; compendia of contact information, 
<br>such as telephone directories (in compact disc or electronic 
<br>format if available) and e-mail listings; internet and 
<br>intranet "handles", internet e-mail addresses, web site 
<br>identification-URLs; credit card account numbers; frequent 
<br>flyer account numbers; work schedules, and other relevant 
<br>biographical information.
