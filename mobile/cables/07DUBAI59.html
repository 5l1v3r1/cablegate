<br>REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>1.(C) Summary: In a January 23 meeting in Dubai with U/S Burns, 
<br>UAE Vice President, Prime Minister and Dubai Ruler Sheikh 
<br>Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum (MbR) expressed concern about the 
<br>potential negative impact on Dubai of  possible future UN 
<br>sanctions against Iran; he urged the quiet US-UAE cooperation on 
<br>financial and export control restrictions against Iran, offering 
<br>to set up a "joint committee" to this end.  He agreed that Iran 
<br>should not have nuclear weapons, but warned of the dire regional 
<br>consequences of military action.  U/S Burns said the US would 
<br>protect its interests in the region and support Gulf governments 
<br>in resisting efforts by Iran to dominate the region. He 
<br>emphasized the importance of continued support for the Siniora 
<br>government in Lebanon, and the high priority the US put on a 
<br>renewed effort to move the Israelis and Palestinians toward 
<br>peace.  U/S Burns raised the case of Amcit Vafa Valapour, which 
<br>has been under criminal investigation in Dubai for nearly 16 
<br>months without charges before a court(although under the local 
<br>system police charges have been filed); MbR asked his aides to 
<br>ensure the case moved forward as rapidly and transparently as 
<br>possible  End Summary. 
<br> 
<br>2.(C) On January 23, U/S for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns 
<br>met with MbR for one hour in MbR's downtown office.  Burns was 
<br>accompanied by NEA PDAS Jim Jeffrey, the Ambassador, the Consul 
<br>General, P Staff assistant Herro Mustafa and ConGen notetaker. 
<br>MbR was accompanied by his sons Sheikh Hamdan (who chairs the 
<br>Dubai Executive Council, the Emirate's governing body) and 
<br>Sheikh Mayed; Minister for Cabinet Affairs (and Dubai Holdings 
<br>head) Mohammed Gergawi; federal Minister for Education Dr. Hanif 
<br>al Qasimi; Dubai General Security Service head Brigadier 
<br>Mohammed al Qemzi; Dubai World head Sultan bin Sulayem; and 
<br>Emirates Airlines chairman and Dubai Civil Aviation head Sheikh 
<br>Ahmed bin Sayed al Maktoum. U/S Burns expressed admiration for 
<br>the Dubai's rapid development, hailing it as an open and 
<br>productive model that was now being emulated throughout the 
<br>region. 
<br> 
<br>3.(C) Lebanon: U/S Burns conveyed the gratitude of the Lebanese 
<br>government for financial and other assistance from the UAE.  MbR 
<br>said the UAE understands that the Siniora government needs 
<br>regional support. U/S Burns urged continued assistance, noting 
<br>the US will soon offer the Siniora government $1 billion for 
<br>security and reconstruction efforts. 
<br> 
<br>4.(C) Iran sanctions: U/S Burns highlighted the significance of 
<br>the June 2006 international offer to negotiate with Iran to 
<br>resolve the nuclear issue--the first official US offer to 
<br>negotiate with Tehran in 27 years.  Tehran had rejected this 
<br>broadly-supported, reasonable proposal, which offered economic 
<br>incentives such as sanctions relief and the sale of civilian 
<br>airliners in addition to negotiations.  U/S Burns said that the 
<br>UNSCR 1737's limited sanctions were a first step to pressure 
<br>Iran to compromise, but that absent Iranian movement another, 
<br>more restrictive, sanctions resolution is likely in February. 
<br>The US was also taking bilateral action through Treasury 
<br>designations against Iranian banks that were funding terrorism. 
<br> 
<br>5.(C) MbR expressed willingness to cooperate in financial 
<br>restrictions against Iran, but urged that the cooperation be 
<br>conducted quietly; he offered to set up a "joint committee" to 
<br>do so (he did not offer details); he later repeated this offer 
<br>with regard to military transfers (see para 8).  He voiced 
<br>concern regarding the potential negative impact of economic 
<br>sanctions on Dubai, and against the "good Iranians" -- including 
<br>Dubai's estimated 350,000 Iranians residents. U/S Burns and 
<br>Ambassador Sison expressed readiness to engage with Dubai on 
<br>financial cooperation against Iran. (Note: the number of 
<br>resident Iranians was supplied by Al Qemzi, and is higher that 
<br>the 200-300 thousand usual cited by the Dubai officials.) 
<br> 
<br>6.(C) Iran and Gulf Security: U/S Burns stated that the US will 
<br>protect its interests and support its allies, like the UAE, in 
<br>the face of Iranian attempts to dominate the Gulf.  This is why 
<br>we have stationed a second carrier battle group there, and have 
<br>detained Iranian agents in Iraq who were providing arms and bomb 
<br>components used to kill US troops.  MbR stated that the UAE does 
<br>not want Iran to have nuclear weapons, and urged continued 
<br>international pressure on Iran, but expressed deep concern about 
<br>the destabilizing consequences to the UAE and to region of a 
<br>military strike.  He urged that the US find a way to stop or 
<br>disarm Iran without using military force.  U/S Burns reiterated 
<br> 
<br>DUBAI 00000059  002.2 OF 002 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>that the US wants a diplomatic solution, and is working with the 
<br>UN and its allies toward this end; strong UAE support was 
<br>important to this effort. 
<br> 
<br>7.(C) MbR expressed hope for change inside Iran, which U/S Burns 
<br>echoed.  Burns noted the US wants to support the influence of 
<br>moderate Iranians and encourage Iran to engage in negotiations. 
<br>Minister Gergawi mentioned rumors that Supreme leader Khamenei 
<br>is suffering from prostate cancer.  Gergawi opined that the 
<br>merchant class in Iran has been pressuring Ahmadinejad over his 
<br>failing economic policy.  He asserted that the growing sectarian 
<br>conflict in Iraq, as well as the hanging of Saddam Hussein 
<br>(which, he implied, was inspired by Iranian pressure), have now 
<br>undermined the possibility of a regional alliance between 
<br>extremist Sunnis and Shia.  Regional Sunnis now blame Iran for 
<br>instability in Lebanon and Iraq. (Note: Gergawi's family is of 
<br>Iranian origin, and he acts as one of MbR's principal advisors 
<br>on Iran.) 
<br> 
<br>8.(C) Security cooperation: U/S Burns called the Gulf 
<br>Cooperation Council a good forum for quiet security cooperation, 
<br>and reiterated that the US seeks a close, productive dialogue 
<br>with the UAE on Gulf security.  The US opposes arms sales to 
<br>Iran and will urge its partners in the European Union, Russia 
<br>and the Middle East to cooperate on this front.  MbR reiterated 
<br>his offer to set up a committee to cooperate on these issues. 
<br> 
<br>9.(C) Israel/Palestinians: U/S Burns stressed that the US 
<br>believes progress between Israel and the Palestinians toward 
<br>peace is central to regional stability, and supports the 
<br>creation of a Palestinian state.  This would be "the best 
<br>thing," MbR replied; a peace deal would make radical groups like 
<br>HAMAS "everyone's enemy". Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas 
<br>should be supported, particularly since HAMAS is funded by Iran. 
<br> MbR noted UAE assistance was again flowing to the Palestinians, 
<br>although it had been suspended for a time because of corruption 
<br>concerns.  U/S Burns said the US is careful to ensure its 
<br>assistance is going to the Palestinian people, rather than the 
<br>HAMAS government, and is confident in the assistance mechanisms 
<br>now in place. 
<br> 
<br>10.(C) Valapour case: U/S Burns raised the case of Amcit Vafa 
<br>Valapour, who has been under criminal investigation in Dubai for 
<br>nearly 16 months. U/S Burns said the US sought return of 
<br>Valapour's passport, which has been held by the Dubai police. 
<br>He underscored that, while he was taking no substantive position 
<br>on the merits of the case, the US believes the case should move 
<br>forward with due process as quickly as possible.  MbR was 
<br>unfamiliar with the case, and turned to Gergawi for background. 
<br>Gergawi outlined the Dubai government view of the case, saying 
<br>the bottom line is that Valapour and his non-USC partners had 
<br>profited from insider information in a deal on the Dubai Metro 
<br>project with a corrupt Dubai official. "We don't tolerate 
<br>corruption," Gergawi concluded.  The Consul General noted that 
<br>he had recently met with the Dubai Attorney General (reftel) on 
<br>the case.  The AG had agreed to meet with Valapour's US and 
<br>Emirati representatives to help to resolve the issue.  MbR asked 
<br>his aides to ensure the case moved forward as quickly and 
<br>transparently as possible, and promised Valapour would receive 
<br>fair treatment. 
<br> 
<br>11.(C) Afghanistan: U/S Burns expressed appreciation for UAE 
<br>assistance in Afghanistan, and urged support for the Karzai 
<br>government. MbR asserted the UAE and US are partners against 
<br>drugs, money laundering, and terrorism and in Afghanistan.  He 
<br>said the best weapon against the Taliban was economic 
<br>investment. U/S Burns outlined ongoing reconstruction efforts, 
<br>and noted the difficulty of creating economically viable 
<br>substitutes for drug crops.  MbR said Karzai is reluctant to 
<br>tackle the drug issue because he fears decreased support in the 
<br>provinces. 
<br> 
<br>12.(C) Comment: MbR offered little new, other than his somewhat 
<br>vague offer to create a bilateral committee to address financial 
<br>and arms/technology flows to Iran. He is clearly concerned 
<br>regarding the prospect of more comprehensive UN economic 
<br>sanctions, given that Iran is Dubai's largest trading partner, 
<br>an assertion often cited by Dubai officials (although good 
<br>Dubai/Iran trade numbers are hard to come by).  We will follow 
<br>up to try to get a better read on the scope of MbR's offer.
