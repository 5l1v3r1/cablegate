<br>REF: A. 08 MADRID 1359
<br>¶B. 08 MADRID 518
<br>
<br>Classified By: Charge d'Affaires Arnold A. Chacon for reasons 1.4 (b) a
<br>nd (d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: Ambassador Aguirre conducted a series of
<br>farewell calls on key GOS officials in the weeks before
<br>departing Post on January 20. Those meetings contributed to
<br>the information in this cable, which offers the Ambassador's
<br>final thoughts on how the Obama Administration might best
<br>engage key personalities within the Zapatero Administration.
<br>END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) COMMENT: The GOS is clearly eager to ramp up its
<br>engagement with the Obama Administration and plans to
<br>immediately implement a diplomatic full court press to
<br>"normalize" bilateral ties, after years of Madrid perceiving
<br>itself to be on the outs with Washington. There is currently
<br>a wave of goodwill in Spain for President Obama and his
<br>administration. Zapatero, who feels a spiritual kinship with
<br>President Obama and identifies with him in a personal way,
<br>has publicly pledged that "Obama will have in Spain and its
<br>government a faithful ally and friend." Meanwhile, Foreign
<br>Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos has publicly voiced the GOS's
<br>expectation that bilateral relations will enter "a phase of
<br>greater harmony" in which ties are "more intimate, more
<br>intense, and more fluid." Senior Spanish officials publicly
<br>have expressed hope that Zapatero and Obama will have a
<br>formal meeting in 2009, preferably at the White House.
<br>Spanish officials also have informed the media that Vice
<br>President Biden told Zapatero in a November 17 phone
<br>conversation that he would visit Spain shortly after taking
<br>office to discuss the global financial crisis. Zapatero
<br>recently announced his interest in phoning the President soon
<br>for an in-depth conversation to discuss conflict areas and
<br>Latin America - including Cuba - and on other occasions has
<br>signaled his interest in cooperation on global issues such as
<br>combating terrorism, poverty and climate change. Managing
<br>GOS expectations on the timetable and the extent of bilateral
<br>cooperation will be key to maintaining their current
<br>enthusiasm for collaborating on projects of mutual interest.
<br>END COMMENT.
<br>
<br>//King Juan Carlos de Borbon//
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) The Ambassador urges the new Administration to engage
<br>with King Juan Carlos I, the Spanish Head of State. Juan
<br>Carlos is well-disposed to the U.S. but he will always act in
<br>what he perceives to be the best interests of Spain. Where
<br>U.S. and Spanish interests coincide, he can be a formidable
<br>ally. In meetings, the King will try to charm interlocutors
<br>and will bring down the level of formality and protocol to
<br>make them feel comfortable, thereby seek to guide the
<br>relationship. It is best to stay at the King's level of
<br>banter and not be cowed by his aura. If you push back with
<br>joviality at any verbal jousting, you will win his respect.
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) The King has a respectful relationship with Zapatero
<br>and they communicate well. Zapatero consults and informs the
<br>King on issues from time to time and the King has no
<br>reluctance to offer his thoughts - but not his advice - on
<br>issues. The King is selective when he wants the GOS to do
<br>something, discreetly passing the word through Zapatero or
<br>his Cabinet. The King does have influence with Zapatero when
<br>he wants to use it.
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) For example, the Ambassador is convinced that the King
<br>was the guiding force - over the objections of Foreign
<br>Minister Moratinos - in the GOS naming Jorge Dezcallar to be
<br>the current Ambassador to the United States. The Ambassador
<br>believes this in part because the King identified Dezcallar
<br>to the Ambassador as the next Spanish envoy to Washington six
<br>months before the decision was announced by the GOS. The
<br>Ambassador believes that Juan Carlos chose Dezcallar because
<br>he believes Dezcallar will do the best job for Spain in that
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000071 002 OF 006
<br>
<br>
<br>position. Of course, it also helps that Juan Carlos likes
<br>Dezcallar and that Dezcallar has some personal allegiance to
<br>the King.
<br>
<br>¶6. (U) Juan Carlos will visit Florida (Pensacola during
<br>February 18-19 and Miami on February 19) as part of
<br>celebrations to mark the 450th anniversary of the first
<br>Spanish expedition to set foot in what is today the United
<br>States. According to Spanish press reports, Spanish
<br>diplomatic sources suggest he may meet Obama Administration
<br>officials during his visit.
<br>
<br>//President Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero//
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) Zapatero is a wily politician with an uncanny ability
<br>- like a cat in a jungle - to sense opportunity or danger.
<br>It is dangerous to underestimate him, as many former rivals
<br>have found out too late. In making decisions and formulating
<br>policy, he plays to his domestic audience, especially voters
<br>outside the Madrid region, which he looks down upon for a
<br>kind of "inside the Beltway" insularity that he perceives as
<br>detached from the concerns and views of most Spaniards. He
<br>is playing to the peanut gallery rather than to the front
<br>row. Zapatero, who is heading his second minority
<br>government, is constantly fighting for the support of the 1-2
<br>million swing voters and traditional non-voters. In the
<br>Ambassador's judgment, there are no issues that Zapatero
<br>would fall on his sword over; all options are always on the
<br>table in order to achieve his immediate political goals.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Zapatero has faced a steep learning curve on foreign
<br>policy issues, but has developed a broad strategic vision
<br>that recognizes the inter-relationships and cause and effect
<br>consequences of his government's actions. Nowadays he is
<br>well informed on any topic. Zapatero has the capacity to
<br>learn, absorb, and connect the dots. He is bright and
<br>continually gets the better of detractors who underestimate
<br>him.
<br>
<br>¶9. (S) Zapatero is not a "conviction" politician but
<br>undoubtedly understands the Spanish people and will support
<br>whatever policy appeals to them, regardless of U.S.
<br>interests. However, Zapatero also has shown that if there is
<br>an issue of particular importance to the USG, he can be
<br>amenable to working with us despite internal opposition. For
<br>example, at one point the Ambassador informed Zapatero that
<br>U.S. CEO's might decide to stop bidding in Spain due to a
<br>growing perception that the GOS was not welcoming US bidders
<br>on procurement contracts. Zapatero had told the Ambassador
<br>to let him know if there was something important to the USG
<br>and he would take care of it. Later - when the USG had
<br>agreed to advocate on behalf of GE in a bid against Rolls
<br>Royce for a Spanish MOD contract to provide helicopter motors
<br>- GE informed the Ambassador that failure to win the contract
<br>would cause that branch of GE to cease operations in Spain,
<br>which the Ambassador duly informed Zapatero's economic
<br>adviser. Although there was considerable all-source evidence
<br>to suggest that the MOD decided to award the contract to
<br>Rolls Royce, Moncloa - the office of the President -
<br>overturned the decision and it was announced that GE had won
<br>the bid. The Ambassador is convinced that Zapatero
<br>personally intervened in the case in favor of GE.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Zapatero is not innately ill-disposed to the USG.
<br>For him, foreign policy is subordinate to domestic political
<br>interests and the U.S. relationship is just one more element
<br>to be viewed according to the circumstances of the moment.
<br>There is currently a wave of goodwill for President Obama in
<br>Spain, which is the answer to Zapatero's prayers in that it
<br>enables him to engage the USG without being dinged by the
<br>traditional anti-U.S. sentiment among his political base.
<br>
<br>¶11. (S) The best way to interact with Zapatero in meetings is
<br>to be pleasant and relaxed and be ready for some initial
<br>banter. The Ambassador advises to ask him open-ended
<br>questions and allow him to talk about what's on his mind.
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000071 003 OF 006
<br>
<br>
<br>Zapatero will be well prepared on substance. Zapatero
<br>welcomes dialogue and an exchange of ideas. He does not
<br>respond well to being lectured and will end the conversation
<br>if he perceives that is what is occurring. Similarly, do not
<br>corner him politically or ambush him publicly. Give him room
<br>and he will listen to your ideas. If there are political
<br>differences, they would be best discussed behind closed
<br>doors. It is best to have open lines of communications with
<br>Zapatero's team, which has access to him at all times. The
<br>USG needs to maintain and further cultivate access to the
<br>people who have access to Zapatero, the most well-connected
<br>of which are listed below.
<br>
<br>//GOS Officials with Access to Zapatero//
<br>
<br>I) Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega, the First Vice
<br>President and Minister of the Presidency
<br>
<br>¶12. (S) Fernandez de la Vega is a key player with access to
<br>Zapatero. She is his able lieutenant and the executor of his
<br>policies. Fernandez de la Vega has an icy personality and
<br>brings a sterile, surgical approach to her work. There are
<br>rumors that Fernandez de la Vega may be removed during an
<br>impending Cabinet shuffle by Zapatero. The Ambassador
<br>believes that Zapatero has no personal allegiance to her
<br>beyond being a strong member of his team. She delivers and
<br>is effective at what she does, but the moment she ceases to
<br>be useful to him, he will let her go at the first politically
<br>convenient moment. The Ambassador does not believe she
<br>aspires to higher office and suggests she knows this post
<br>will be the peak of her career. She is not especially a
<br>friend of the USG, but is a pragmatist and interacts with the
<br>USG as needed. U.S. interlocutors would be well advised to
<br>use a firm backbone when dealing with Fernandez de la Vega,
<br>which the Ambassador suggests will help develop mutual
<br>respect.
<br>
<br>II) Bernardino Leon, Secretary General of the Office of the
<br>President
<br>
<br>¶13. (S) Leon is a smart and impressive interlocutor who is
<br>well-connected to and has the ear of Zapatero (As highlighted
<br>in REFTEL A). He is the golden boy of the GOS and his
<br>influence is on the rise. The Ambassador opines that Leon's
<br>career will take him far beyond where he is now and envisions
<br>that he could easily become Foreign Minister one day. At
<br>present, Leon is more important to Zapatero than Foreign
<br>Minister Moratinos or any other single cabinet minister
<br>because the breadth of his duties transcends any individual
<br>ministry and has virtually no parameters. Although his
<br>expertise is in foreign policy, Leon is currently Zapatero's
<br>go-to guy on both international and domestic issues (for
<br>example, he is even involved in budget negotiations between
<br>Spain's central government and the regional governments).
<br>Leon commands an impressive capability to digest incredible
<br>quantities of information on a range of topics, connect the
<br>dots and present them in a insightful, cogent and persuasive
<br>fashion. The Ambassador likened Leon's talent to a human
<br>version of Google. Leon also has an aptitude for creative
<br>problem-solving, such as his efforts in 2005 - as Deputy
<br>Foreign Minister - to ensure that a scheduled speech by
<br>Venezuela's Hugo Chavez in Salamanca, Spain did not upstage a
<br>cross-town meeting of the Summit of the Americas. Leon has
<br>been displeased with recent press reports touting his growing
<br>influence with Zapatero at the expense of Fernandez de la
<br>Vega or Moratinos. The Ambassador suggests Leon's ego is fed
<br>by what he accomplishes rather than by what people tell him
<br>or write about him. Leon has a passion for his work and
<br>interlocutors will find him very well informed on Latin
<br>America, Africa, the Middle East, and Russia.
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) The Ambassador cites Zapatero's recruitment of Leon
<br>to the Office of the Presidency as the result of a rare
<br>instance in which foreign policy unfavorably impacted
<br>Zapatero domestically. Zapatero decided to shuffle his
<br>foreign policy advisers when the blowback from unflattering
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000071 004 OF 006
<br>
<br>
<br>media coverage of Zapatero at the NATO Summit in Bucharest
<br>impacted his standing at home. (See REFTEL B).
<br>
<br>III) Milagros Hernando, President of the International
<br>Department of the Office of the President
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) Known as Mila, career diplomat Hernando acts as chief
<br>of staff to Leon, to whom she owes her job. Her geographic
<br>expertise is Europe - Leon's weakest area - which makes them
<br>a Yin & Yang team that complement each other. Their
<br>relationship is based on mutual trust. There is no daylight
<br>between them on policy issues. Hernando's role is for Leon's
<br>aggrandizement; she will protect him and will not take credit
<br>behind his back. With Leon as busy as he is, Hernando is
<br>more accessible to USG interlocutors.
<br>
<br>IV) Gen. Felix Sanz, High Representative for the Spanish
<br>Presidency of the EU on Defense Issues
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) On defense issues, Sanz, the Chief of the Defense
<br>Staff (CHOD) during 2004-08, might prove an alternate channel
<br>to Zapatero. Sanz has very positive views of the United
<br>States, despite knowing that in 2008 the USG did not vote for
<br>him to be the next Chairman of the Military Committee at
<br>NATO. He is not bitter about the incident, but knows he owes
<br>the USG no favors for it.
<br>
<br>//Zapatero's Inner Circle//
<br>
<br>¶17. (S) Zapatero keeps his own counsel and rarely asks for
<br>his subordinates' input on key issues. As his confidence has
<br>grown while he has been in office, he is doing so less
<br>frequently and will do so only with a select inner circle of
<br>three additional advisers besides Leon. The Ambassador
<br>suggests that Zapatero's thinking is that he does not need
<br>the advice of others and/or they are not useful to his
<br>decision-making process, so he does not reach out for their
<br>views.
<br>
<br>I) Jose "Pepe" Blanco, Vice Secretary General in Zapatero,s
<br>Spanish Socialist Workers Party (PSOE)
<br>
<br>¶18. (S) Zapatero consults Blanco, the #2 official in the
<br>PSOE, on political issues. The Ambassador describes Blanco
<br>as a very important element in the equation for maintaining
<br>strong bilateral relations. Contact with him must be
<br>maintained to continue providing messages to Zapatero.
<br>However, Blanco leaves a bad taste in the mouth of some past
<br>U.S. interlocutors, whom he strikes as particularly
<br>untrustworthy. Blanco has an unfailing idiosyncrasy of never
<br>looking interlocutors in the eye when he shakes hands.
<br>Furthermore, he has a reputation for being especially
<br>ruthless on political issues, which he appears to relish.
<br>
<br>¶19. (U) Blanco and Jesus Caldera, the PSOE's Secretary for
<br>Ideas and Projects, will travel to Washington, DC in
<br>mid-February to attend a conference on the "historical
<br>change" in the United States that the new President
<br>represents.
<br>II) Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, Minister of Interior
<br>
<br>¶20. (S) Zapatero also consults Rubalcaba, who tops the
<br>Ambassador's list of the most impressive GOS officials. The
<br>Ambassador suggested that Rubalcaba sees himself as the
<br>smartest person in Cabinet but conveys no hubris. Rubalcaba
<br>is smart enough to know that he needs the USG on
<br>counter-terrorism (CT) issues and therefore he has been
<br>cooperative with U.S. interlocutors on that topic. Rubalcaba
<br>excels out putting out fires, but also fully understands the
<br>extent of the lack of inter-agency cooperation in his
<br>Ministry between the Spanish National Police and the Civil
<br>Guard. The Ambassador suggests Zapatero is consulting with
<br>Rubalcaba for ideas on who should succeed intelligence
<br>director Alberto Saiz, whose five-year mandate expires in
<br>April, but the Ambassador also places the odds at better than
<br>even that Zapatero renews Saiz's mandate since it is the path
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000071 005 OF 006
<br>
<br>
<br>of least resistance.
<br>
<br>¶21. (S) Rubalcaba is feeling the weight of power and is
<br>looking for an opportunity to leave his Ministry and possibly
<br>the GOS, suggests the Ambassador. Rubalcaba - whose wife
<br>reportedly wants him to step down - takes the deaths of
<br>Spaniards to heart, whether at the hands of ETA terrorists,
<br>traffic deaths on the highways or criminal violence. It is
<br>starting to wear on him, and he has suggested he is no longer
<br>at his peak performance. He told the Ambassador he intended
<br>to step down in early 2008 at the end of the first Zapatero
<br>government, but he miscalculated and informed Zapatero too
<br>late in the latter's planning process. Rubalcaba is
<br>extremely loyal to Zapatero, who understands that he needs
<br>Rubalcaba and will make it difficult for him to step down.
<br>The Ambassador recommends that Rubalcaba - who is very
<br>accessible to the Embassy despite his busy schedule - remains
<br>a contact that the USG cultivates, whether he remains in his
<br>current post or not. He will continue to be an important
<br>player in Spanish politics in either case.
<br>
<br>III) Jose Antonio Alonso, PSOE Spokesman in the Congress of
<br>Deputies
<br>
<br>¶22. (C) According to the Ambassador, Zapatero also consults
<br>Alonso, a judge and childhood friend whom Zapatero recruited
<br>to be his Minister of Interior (2004-6) and later his
<br>Minister of Defense (2006-08) in his first government, before
<br>asking him to assume his current post. The two are close and
<br>Alonso is keenly loyal to Zapatero.
<br>
<br>//Three Other Key GOS Personalities in the Bilateral
<br>Relationship//
<br>
<br>¶23. (S) Foreign Minister Moratinos is not the most impressive
<br>member of cabinet, but he is an honest broker who should be
<br>taken seriously. He is well meaning albeit egotistical,
<br>according to the Ambassador. The Foreign Minister belongs to
<br>a second, outer ring of Zapatero advisers. His allegiance is
<br>to Spain - rather than to Zapatero or even to his own career
<br>advancement - and he is idealistically motivated to "do the
<br>right thing." The Ambassador discounts speculation, which
<br>has existed since before the Ambassador arrived, that
<br>Zapatero will shuffle Moratinos out of his current post any
<br>time soon. The Ambassador believes that Moratinos suits the
<br>bill well enough for Zapatero's purposes. The Ambassador
<br>knows of no ill-will or jealousy on the part of Moratinos for
<br>Leon's growing influence with Zapatero.
<br>
<br>¶24. (S) In meetings, Moratinos often tries to overpower or
<br>bully his interlocutors in an attempt to establish a superior
<br>negotiating position. It is fairly well known in Madrid
<br>among the Ambassadorial corps that Moratinos is given to
<br>screaming at foreign Ambassadors and chastising them at the
<br>first opportunity to put them in their place. It is a tactic
<br>that has caused many Ambassadors to leave with their tail
<br>between their legs. The Ambassador recommends that his
<br>successor and other senior-level USG interlocutors stand
<br>their ground against Moratinos and force him to deal with
<br>them on an even level. Once this happens, the relationship
<br>will likely prove far more harmonious. Meanwhile, Moratinos
<br>had a very healthy professional admiration for former
<br>Secretary of State Rice, whose attention he craved and whose
<br>approval he sought.
<br>
<br>¶25. (S) Carme Chacon is smart and has gained enough respect
<br>to be effective as Defense Minister. She has also been a
<br>real asset to Zapatero in the way she has handled the
<br>portfolio in the public eye. However, she is immature in a
<br>political sense, according to the Ambassador. She is too
<br>focused on the little things - such as the lack of parity in
<br>the bilateral defense relationship or by implying that she
<br>needs to be treated with more deference - and is not focused
<br>on larger issues like weapons systems. She does not have a
<br>huge ego, but she is wearing the Spanish ego. The Ambassador
<br>says the USG will not be able to change her, so it will need
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000071 006 OF 006
<br>
<br>
<br>to adapt and work with her. She is still developing her
<br>political senses and will be an important player in Spanish
<br>politics for years to come. The Ambassador predicted that
<br>she will grow in her job and recommends future U.S.
<br>interlocutors treat her with an eye to the future. The
<br>Ambassador also remarked that Chacon is finding that all of
<br>the media attention she has received since she became Defense
<br>Minister can be a double-edged sword. Early favorable
<br>coverage (when she inspected the troops while pregnant) has
<br>lately given way to more negative, if irrelevant reports (as
<br>when she wore a controversial smoking jacket to a military
<br>parade).
<br>
<br>¶26. (C) Finally, the Ambassador identified his Spanish
<br>counterpart in Washington, Ambassador Jorge Dezcallar (also
<br>discussed in Paragraph 5 above) as an important contact for
<br>the new Administration to cultivate in the bilateral
<br>relationship, predicting that Dezcallar will be a linchpin in
<br>the bilateral relationship in the year ahead. The Ambassador
<br>also suggests that Dezcallar would likely respond well to
<br>increased social interaction with USG officials.
