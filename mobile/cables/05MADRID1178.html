<br>SUBJECT: DEMARCHE TO ZAPATERO ON MEETING WITH CHAVEZ, LULA,
<br>URIBE
<br>
<br>REF: A. A) SECSTATE 52920
<br>¶B. B) HALL - MANZANARES E-MAIL OF 3/23
<br>
<br>Classified By: Charge d'Affaires Bob Manzanares; reasons 1.4 (B) and (D
<br>)
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) Charge conveyed Ref A points to National Security
<br>Adviser Carles Casajuana on March 23. Casajuana stressed the
<br>correlation of USG-Spanish interests in a stable, democratic
<br>Venezuela and assured Charge that the USG points would be
<br>provided to President Zapatero and his party prior to
<br>Zapatero's departure for the region on March 28.
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) The largest-ciruclation Spanish dailies, "El Pais" and
<br>"El Mundo", provided extensive front page coverage of "U.S.
<br>concern" regarding the Spanish weapons sale to Venezuela and
<br>President Zapatero's overtures to Chavez. These press
<br>stories indicate that Spain made a final decision on March 27
<br>on the weapons package it would offer Venezuela, which will
<br>include:
<br>
<br>- 4 coastal patrol boats
<br>- 4 ocean going corvettes
<br>- 2 oil tankers
<br>- 1
<br>- 10 C-295 transport aircraft
<br>- 2 coastal patrol aircraft
<br>
<br>The total value of the sale is estimated at Euros 1.3 billion
<br>(USDOLS 1.69 billion) and will reportedly provide 600 jobs
<br>for 6 years at Spain's hard-pressed Navantia shipyards.
<br>Separately, Spanish oil giant Repsol-YPF and Petroleos de
<br>Venezuela were expected to conclude a cooperation agreement
<br>during Zapatero's visit, which could include up to USDOLS 185
<br>million in investments in Venezuela by Repsol.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) "El Pais," which has close ties to the ruling
<br>Socialist Party, cited unnamed sources who asserted that the
<br>MFA had strongly opposed the weapons sale to Venezuela
<br>because it would undermine Spanish relations with Colombia
<br>and the USG. The press story cast the four-leader format of
<br>the summit as an effort by the MFA to mollify the USG by
<br>ensuring Uribe's inclusion in the most high-profile element
<br>of the Zapatero visit. This tracks with numerous private
<br>conversations with MFA contacts at various levels, including
<br>Deputy FM Bernardino Leon, who were clearly uncomfortable
<br>with the nature of the weapons sale to Venezuela and insisted
<br>that Defense Minister Jose Bono pushed the deal through
<br>despite the MFA's strong opposition. The MFA is now in spin
<br>control mode, minimizing the potential offensive capability
<br>of the weapons package (describing the corvettes as "patrol
<br>boats" for example) and working hard to protect the GOS from
<br>USG and opposition criticism.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) With Ref A demarche, we have now raised our concerns
<br>regarding Spanish overtures and weapons sales to Venezuela in
<br>at least eight separate meetings with GOS officials,
<br>including with Deputy FM Leon, Defense Minister Bono, Deputy
<br>Defense Minister Pardo, and CHOD Sans. More importantly,
<br>Attorney General Gonzalez raised Venezuela as a key source of
<br>bilateral friction during his March 10 meetings with Vice
<br>President Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega and FM Moratinos.
<br>Given the magnitude of the sale, we did not expect to derail
<br>the ship deal, but the USG's constant pressure on this issue
<br>does make clear that the weapons sale will remain a drag on
<br>efforts to improve bilateral relations.
