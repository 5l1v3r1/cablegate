<br>SUMMARY 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) In mid-January, a local chief in the diamond rich 
<br>and violence-ridden XXXXXXXXXXXX  
<br>informed us of the Zimbabwean military's intention to 
<br>displace as many as 25,000 villagers from their homes XXXXXXXXXXXX.
<br> The military operation is intended to establish 
<br>control over the diamond fields as well as to provide 
<br>village-based housing to troops. The plan was temporarily 
<br>delayed due to the discovery of gold ore in the region where 
<br>the villagers were to be relocated. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br>Military Operation to Displace Thousands 
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXXXX the local chief in 
<br>the conflict-ridden XXXXXXXXXXXX diamond fields of XXXXXXXXXXXX 
<br>Zimbabwe, met with poloff to describe a military operation 
<br>intended to displace the region's 20,000 to 25,000 residents. 
<br>He said that the military had informed them that XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>had been named a "government reserve area" and consequently, 
<br>it was authorized to displace all the local residents in and 
<br>around the XXXXXXXXXXXX diamond fields. He estimated that the 
<br>area in question encompassed several hundred square 
<br>kilometers, which is well in excess of the 70 hectare site 
<br>currently being hand-panned. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Chief XXXXXXXXXXXX told us that the military's plan had 
<br>been to move the residents in mid-January from their villages 
<br>to a site near the town of XXXXXXXXXXXX, some 60 kilometers north XXXXXXXXXXXX. 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX has a farm in XXXXXXXXXXXX where the villagers would be placed. While the area is within the boundaries of the 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX farm, the land was described by XXXXXXXXXXXX 
<br>as "just rough bush." The villagers were to be provided with tents 
<br>for shelter, but no other accommodations were to be made for 
<br>their benefit. However, the chief said that the plan was 
<br>scuttled because an unnamed Russian gold mining group with 
<br>operations in the area informed the military that they had 
<br>recently discovered gold at XXXXXXXXXXXX. Consequently, the military is now seeking an alternate relocation site for the villagers. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX also explained that the operation was 
<br>motivated by both a desire to control the area and a need to 
<br>provide housing for the military brigades currently stationed 
<br>in the Marange region. An independent NGO in the area, as 
<br>well as the chief, reported that troops routinely force the 
<br>local villages to provide them with food and shelter, while 
<br>making residents dig for diamonds. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Chief XXXXXXXXXXXX is establishing a trust intended to 
<br>raise funds for the legal defense and protection of displaced 
<br>people in the area and sought our help in the endeavor. 
<br>
<br>------- 
<br>COMMENT 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) The relocation of these villagers, if it occurs, is 
<br>the next preparatory step in the GOZ's plan to use the 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX diamond fields to bail out the failed Zimbabwean 
<br>
<br>HARARE 00000051 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>economy and prop-up the Mugabe patronage system (reftels). 
<br>While we are highly skeptical of the success of that scheme, 
<br>what is certain is that it would result in additional 
<br>suffering for XXXXXXXXXXXX residents. END COMMENT.
