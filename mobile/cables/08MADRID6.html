<br>
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) Summary: I warmly welcome Senator and Mrs.
<br>Lieberman to Madrid. When you arrive, Spain will be emerging
<br>from the Holidays and starting to focus on what is likely to
<br>be a very competitive March 9 general election. Although the
<br>media here prefers to focus on differences in the U.S.-Spain
<br>relationship resulting from Spain's 2004 withdrawal from
<br>Iraq, cooperation is excellent in areas of common interests -
<br>fighting terrorism and organized crime, strengthening NATO
<br>and the Transatlantic security relationship, and in promoting
<br>the spread of democracy in many areas of the world. As the
<br>Hispanic population of the United States continues to grow,
<br>and as Spanish increasingly becomes our second national
<br>language, Spain has the potential to be an even closer U.S.
<br>partner. End summary.
<br>
<br>Counter-Terrorism and Law Enforcement
<br>-------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) U.S.-Spain relations were seriously damaged by
<br>President Zapateros's decision soon after his reelection in
<br>2004 to precipitously withdraw Spanish forces from Iraq.
<br>However, over the last several years both countries have made
<br>a concerted and successful effort to rebuild the relationship
<br>based on strong mutual interests in counter-terrorism,
<br>fighting narcotics trafficking and organized crime, and
<br>rapidly expanding economic ties. The real bilateral story is
<br>found in novel initiatives such as the HSPD-6 agreement we
<br>signed in September to facilitate the sharing of information
<br>between our national counter-terrorism authorities. Spain is
<br>home to a large and growing Muslim population. The March 11,
<br>2004, train bombings were a shock to Spain (21 of the
<br>suspects were convicted here in October). Spain remains a
<br>target of Islamic extremists; al-Qaeda has called for attacks
<br>to recapture the medieval "Al Andalus". The Spanish are
<br>actively pursuing Islamic extremist terrorism-related
<br>investigations and have scores of suspects in jail. Neither
<br>has the threat of ETA terror gone away: two Spanish Civil
<br>Guard officers were murdered in France in early December by
<br>the Basque terrorist group.
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) Narcotics trafficking is another area of common
<br>concern. Andean cocaine is a serious problem here, and
<br>Colombian trafficking organizations are active in Spain.
<br>Money laundering is another serious issue. We are eager to
<br>find ways to increase bilateral cooperation and to encourage
<br>Spain to engage more aggressively with law enforcement
<br>authorities in key Latin American countries.
<br>
<br>Security and Diplomatic Cooperation
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) Spanish military cooperation matters. The bases of
<br>Rota and Moron are strategic hubs, midway between the U.S.
<br>and Afghanistan and Iraq. U.S. planes and ships account for
<br>around 5,000 flights and 250 port calls a year in Spain. The
<br>Spanish military is pro-U.S. and pro-NATO. The navy employs
<br>the AEGIS system in its frigates and has been working for
<br>five years to acquire the Tomahawk missile system. Spain is
<br>also interested in the Joint Strike Fighter. We need to keep
<br>this military-to-military relationship strong.
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) Spain has 750 troops with ISAF in Afghanistan and a
<br>provincial reconstruction team in Badghis province. They
<br>have contributed some 150 million Euros in Afghan
<br>reconstruction funds. Planning is underway to allow the
<br>Spanish to train and equip an Afghan Army company, which we
<br>hope will be a prelude to the training and equipping of a
<br>full battalion. On Iraq, Spain has contributed $22 million
<br>to the Basrah Children's Hospital and a further $28 million
<br>in development funding for Iraq. Spain has nearly 1,100
<br>troops with UNIFIL in Lebanon and about 700 in Kosovo.
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) On the diplomatic front, Spain in recent years has
<br>more often been a follower than a leader, looking to stay
<br>within EU consensus on issues such as Kosovo, Iran, and
<br>missile defense. It is more forward-leaning on the Middle
<br>East peace process, undoubtedly driven by FM Moratinos' long
<br>personal involvement in the issue. Moratinos was an eager
<br>participant in the Annapolis Conference and helped ensure
<br>Spain made a robust pledge of support for the Palestinian
<br>Authority during the recent Paris donors' conference. Driven
<br>by the twin threats of terrorism and illegal immigration,
<br>Spain is also increasing its engagement with the countries of
<br>North and Western Africa.
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) Spain is second only to the U.S. in terms of
<br>economic and political influence in Latin America. Spain
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000006 002.2 OF 004
<br>
<br>
<br>wants strong democratic and free market institutions in the
<br>region. Nevertheless, we have sharp differences over Cuba.
<br>Spain's socialist government has opted for engagement,
<br>claiming it can encourage regime elements who want change.
<br>We take every opportunity to remind the Spanish that the
<br>Cuban regime is only interested in survival and that the
<br>Cuban dissidents need and deserve the active and visible
<br>support of democracies everywhere. On Venezuela, the
<br>socialists' early efforts at constructive engagement with
<br>Chavez have gone sour. At the most recent Iberoamerican
<br>Summit, King Juan Carlos publicly interrupted a Chavez tirade
<br>about former Spanish President Aznar, telling the Venezuelan
<br>President to "shut up." The government is uncomfortably
<br>situated between Spanish companies who fear Chavez will move
<br>against their Venezuela interests and the strong public
<br>support for the King.
<br>
<br>Economy
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU) Spain has one of the fastest growing economies in
<br>Europe. In fact, the economy has grown in each of the last
<br>15 years, and per capita GDP passed Italy's in 2006. In the
<br>last several years, a housing boom has contributed greatly to
<br>growth, but as elections approach, housing prices are
<br>stagnating, construction is slowing, and unemployment and
<br>inflation are staring to creep up. U.S. investment has long
<br>been important to the economy (more so than bilateral trade),
<br>but the tables have turned. This year, Spain has been the
<br>fourth largest foreign investor in the U.S., with particular
<br>emphasis in banking, construction, and renewable energy. In
<br>the latter sector, Spain has the world's largest and third
<br>largest wind power firms, and Spanish firms also are active
<br>in U.S. solar and biofuels projects.
<br>
<br>Elections
<br>---------
<br>
<br>¶9. (SBU) Spain will hold a general election March 9, and the
<br>campaign will just be heating up as you arrive. The ruling
<br>Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) candidate is
<br>President Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. Despite a strong
<br>economy, a budget surplus, and a variety of social spending
<br>initiatives, the early polls indicate a close race.
<br>Nevertheless, the polls also suggest Partido Popular (PP)
<br>candidate Mariano Rajoy has had limited success getting his
<br>message out. The PSOE will run on the economy and its social
<br>programs. The PP will argue the economy is softening and
<br>that the PSOE has made too many concessions to Basque and
<br>Catalan regional governments, is weak on ETA, and soft on
<br>illegal immigration. Foreign affairs is unlikely to be a key
<br>issue, but the PSOE will remind voters it got Spain out of
<br>Iraq while the PP will say Spain's international prestige has
<br>slipped.
<br>
<br>Jewish Community in Spain
<br>-------------------------
<br>
<br>¶10. (SBU) Full religious freedom only returned to Spain in
<br>1978 with the establishment of a democratic constitution. In
<br>practice, Spain is still an overwhelmingly Catholic country,
<br>although Protestant and Islamic believers are increasingly
<br>important demographically. Estimates of the size of the
<br>Jewish community in Spain vary from 50,000 to 100,000
<br>faithful, primarily concentrated in urban areas including
<br>Madrid and Barcelona. The Spanish Federation of Jewish
<br>Communities (FCJE) signed an agreement with the Spanish
<br>government in 1992 establishing Judaism as one of the "deeply
<br>rooted faiths" of Spain. Certain local and regional
<br>governments, among them Toledo, Segovia, and Sevilla, have
<br>sought to capitalize on Jewish tourism by publicizing the
<br>romantic aspects of the Sephardic community in
<br>pre-Inquisition Spain while downplaying the expulsion.
<br>Nevertheless, anti-Semitism remains an undercurrent in Spain;
<br>swastikas and other graffiti appear periodically on buildings
<br>and in neighborhoods associated with Judaism or the
<br>pre-expulsion Sephardic presence. Neo-Nazi propagandists and
<br>ultra-rightists remain present in Spain, most significantly
<br>along the Mediterranean coast in Valencia and Barcelona, but
<br>also in all major cities. In Madrid, skinheads, Falangists
<br>and Franco supporters make their presence known through
<br>infrequent demonstrations and marches, as well as by
<br>harassing the growing immigrant population.
<br>
<br>¶11. (SBU) The USG is currently engaging with the GOS over the
<br>2007 exhumation of three pre-expulsion Sephardic cemeteries
<br>in Andalucia and Catalunya. In each case the cemeteries were
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000006 003.2 OF 004
<br>
<br>
<br>uncovered by accident during excavation for construction or
<br>road projects, and in each instance the local authorities did
<br>not handle the graves in keeping with strict Jewish dictates,
<br>more likely out of ignorance than malice. Based on interest
<br>from concerned Americans, among them Representative Edolphus
<br>Towns, Chairman Warren Miller of the U.S. Commission for the
<br>Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad, and Rabbi David
<br>Niederman of the United Jewish Organization, I, my DCM and
<br>our Consul General in Barcelona have expressed our concern to
<br>the Spanish government that these culturally and religiously
<br>sensitive sites need to be protected and handled in a manner
<br>in keeping with the wishes of the Jewish community in Spain.
<br>Because each municipal government has jurisdiction in affairs
<br>dealing with cemeteries, the government has sought to place
<br>the responsibility on each local jurisdiction. The FCJE and
<br>local Jewish organizations have lobbied the national and
<br>local governments to enact a national protocol for addressing
<br>any future excavations and are hoping to secure funding to
<br>research the location and condition of other cemeteries that
<br>have been lost for centuries. The exhumed remains have since
<br>been re-interred in other Jewish cemeteries with religious
<br>authorities present.
<br>
<br>¶12. (SBU) Critics have accused the Spanish government of
<br>taking anti-Israel stances with respect to both the Middle
<br>East Peace Process and the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict,
<br>while the government has strongly refuted allegations of
<br>anti-Semitism and Israel bashing. Spain's Foreign Minister
<br>Moratinos is a frequent visitor to the region, and he made a
<br>controversial visit to Damascus and Beirut in 2007 in which
<br>he was photographed with the number two of Hizballah.
<br>Nevertheless, he claims to enjoy a good relationship with
<br>Israeli FM Livni and is planning a fence-mending trip to
<br>Israel in the coming months.
<br>
<br>Pisarro Painting Claim
<br>----------------------
<br>
<br>¶13. (SBU) During your conversation with Ambassador Ana
<br>Salomon, you may wish to mention the claim of Claude
<br>Cassirer, an elderly American citizen, for a Camille Pissarro
<br>painting ("Rue Saint Honore") now at the Thyssen Bornemisza
<br>Museum in Madrid, Spain's appeal of a U.S. district court
<br>ruling that U.S. courts have jurisdiction is now before the
<br>9th Circuit. The Nazis forced Mr. Cassirer's grandmother to
<br>sell the painting in 1939. Baron Hans Heinrich
<br>Thyssen-Bornemisza acquired it in 1976. In the early 1990's,
<br>the Spanish Government purchased the collection and built the
<br>current museum. In 1958, Mrs. Cassirer received a DM 120,000
<br>restitution payment for the disappearance and provisional
<br>dispossession of the painting, but retained full right to the
<br>painting. Were Mr. Cassirer to win his claim, he would be
<br>obliged to reimburse this amount to the German authorities.
<br>Pursuant to the 1998 Washington Conference Principles on Nazi
<br>Confiscated Art, Cassirer's attorneys offered to discuss the
<br>claim with the Government of Spain in 2002 but the government
<br>refused. Spain also refused to engage in a mediation process
<br>that was part of the district court proceedings. The
<br>Washington Conference accepted the Principles by consensus,
<br>in which the Spanish representative joined. Dealers,
<br>claimants and holders of artworks generally heed the
<br>principles. Spain correctly points out that the principles
<br>provide for states to "act within the context of their own
<br>laws", and notes that claimant has not filed a claim in
<br>Spain. But the Principles also call on parties to achieve
<br>just and fair solutions on an expeditious basis and to
<br>develop and use alternative dispute resolution mechanisms.
<br>In December 2007, Ambassador Salomon told Ambassador J.
<br>Christian Kennedy, the Special Envoy for Holocaust Issues,
<br>that the new Spanish Minister of Culture might take a more
<br>constructive view of this claim. In June 2005, the then
<br>Special Envoy raised the issue in Madrid with museum and
<br>government officials, to no avail. Earlier correspondence
<br>between the Envoy and the Spanish Ambassador in Washington
<br>was also without result. We recommend you urge Ambassador
<br>Salomon and others as appropriate to engage with Cassirer to
<br>find a mutually acceptable solution.
<br>
<br>Conclusion
<br>----------
<br>
<br>¶14. (SBU) Again, I am looking forward to your visit. While
<br>we want to avoid being an issue in the Spanish elections, we
<br>do need to remind Spain that the bilateral relationship is
<br>founded on strong mutual interests such as counter-terrorism
<br>and law enforcement. Regardless of who wins in March,
<br>terrorists, drug traffickers, and alien smugglers will
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000006 004.2 OF 004
<br>
<br>
<br>continue to see both our countries as targets. We have much
<br>work to do together.
