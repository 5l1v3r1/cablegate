<br>SUBJECT: NOW WHAT? THE KIRCHNERS' OPTIONS IN POST-ELECTION
<br>ARGENTINA
<br>
<br>Classified By: Charge d' Affaires Tom Kelly for reasons 1.4 (B) and (D)
<br>.
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary/Introduction. More than two weeks have
<br>passed since Argentina's ruling first couple lost badly in
<br>mid-term congressional elections. It has taken President
<br>Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner (CFK) and her husband Nestor
<br>time to process the meaning of the debacle and respond.
<br>Though the GOA has taken some significant steps over the past
<br>two weeks, including a Cabinet shuffle, the signals that the
<br>Kirchners and their associates have sent have been decidedly
<br>mixed. It may be another month before their new strategy is
<br>fully discernible.
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) In the past two weeks, Mission personnel have
<br>talked to dozens of political analysts, economists,
<br>businesspersons, and politicians about the Kirchners' likely
<br>course. Most analyses posit three possible scenarios:
<br>radicalization, reform, or the status quo. While there are
<br>serious, smart people who believe that the government will
<br>lurch simply left or right over the coming months, we, and
<br>most of our contacts, believe that the government will behave
<br>in the future much as it has in the past. We think a tepid
<br>move toward reform is more likely than radicalization because
<br>the country's ascendant forces support the former, not the
<br>latter. At the same time, we doubt that Kirchner-led reform
<br>will be ambitious. The best that can be expected from this
<br>weakened government is a "reform-lite" agenda that seeks to
<br>recapture political space without significant policy
<br>concessions. This cable examines the three scenarios in
<br>depth; identifies evidence in support of each one, as well as
<br>indicators to watch for that might clarify the Kirchners'
<br>future intentions; and evaluates the scenarios' likelihood.
<br>A separate message will critically examine another possible
<br>political outcome - that CFK will fail to reach the end of
<br>her term. End Summary/Introduction.
<br>
<br>---------------------------
<br>The Radicalization Scenario
<br>---------------------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) In the first (and least likely) scenario, the
<br>Kirchners react by turning hard left, attempting to reverse
<br>their fortunes through a radicalization of their regime that
<br>would propel them unambiguously into the Bolivarian camp led
<br>by Hugo Chavez. This approach is referred to locally as
<br>"deepening the model." Key elements of this approach would
<br>include:
<br>
<br>-- Economy: Further nationalization of private companies
<br>and/or intensified attempts to manage their behavior; a
<br>partial default on sovereign debt instruments; and a
<br>confirmation of Internal Commerce Secretary Guillermo Moreno
<br>as the executor of NK's dirigiste economic policy; increased
<br>influence by labor unions.
<br>
<br>-- Governance: Abandonment of the Peronist party in favor of
<br>"transversality," in which the Kirchners consort with any and
<br>all who offer their fealty; use of the government budget and
<br>other means to punish Peronist governors and other
<br>politicians deemed disloyal; pursuit of restrictive media
<br>legislation; increased resort to executive decrees.
<br>
<br>-- Foreign Policy: Closer identification with Hugo Chavez
<br>and his Bolivarian allies; increasing criticism of USG
<br>policies.
<br>
<br>-------------------------------
<br>Evidence of a Shift to the Left
<br>-------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) There is a significant group of observers (including
<br>political analyst Rosendo Fraga and Deutsche Bank Managing
<br>Director Marcelo Blanco) who subscribe to this school of
<br>thought. They do not lack evidence. Erstwhile Kirchner
<br>allies in the private sector, including Bank Association
<br>chief Jorge Brito and Argentine Industrialist Association
<br>head Hector Mendez, tell us that they are disgruntled with
<br>the Kirchners and lack influence on them. Their loss seems
<br>to be union boss Hugo Moyano's gain. He flexed his muscles
<br>last week, compelling the GOA to withdraw a subcabinet
<br>nomination in the Health Ministry that threatened his unions'
<br>financial interests and installing the son of his attorney as
<br>head of Aerolineas Argentinas (septel).
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) On the political front, Nestor Kirchner resigned his
<br>position as head of the Peronist Party the day after the June
<br>28 election. Since then, rumors have proliferated of a new
<br>"transversal" approach that elevates Kirchner loyalists and
<br>hard-line ideologues like "piquetero" street activists and
<br>
<br>BUENOS AIR 00000827 002 OF 005
<br>
<br>
<br>the "Carta Abierta" intellectual group. Kirchner showed up
<br>last week at an open-air meeting of "Carta Abierta," his
<br>first public appearance since his June 29 resignation as
<br>Peronist-in-chief. Last week's cabinet shuffle only
<br>strengthened the hands of the loyalists, with no new blood
<br>and the replacement of the reform-oriented Sergio Massa with
<br>Kirchnerista Anibal Fernandez as Cabinet Chief.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Some of the GOA's post-election foreign policy moves
<br>can also be read to support the radicalization thesis. The
<br>most obvious was CFK's spur-of-the-moment trip to Central
<br>America (via the OAS in Washington) in a hastily conceived
<br>effort to restore Manual Zelaya to power in Honduras. Only
<br>Ecuador's Rafael Correa and Paraguay's Fernando Lugo
<br>accompanied CFK and OAS Secretary General Insulza on the
<br>ill-fated Mission. Wittingly or not, she seemed to side with
<br>hasty Bolivarian efforts to force the issue in Honduras
<br>rather than to wait for mediation to take its course. A more
<br>careful leader, Uruguay's Tabare Vazquez, let it be known
<br>that he declined CFK's invitation to join her aboard Tango
<br>One.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) There was one other foreign policy-related event that
<br>may suggest a leftward turn. Kirchner congressional ally
<br>Patricia Vaca Narvaja recently wrote a letter to U.S. Speaker
<br>of the House Nancy Pelosi asking for the USG to declassify
<br>all information at its disposal regarding the Argentine
<br>military dictatorship. The Kirchner government has often
<br>seemed obsessed with refighting the "Dirty War" of the 1970s
<br>and early 80s, and the request could be construed as a
<br>prelude to another rhetorical offensive against the USG for
<br>its "support" of military regimes in the region.
<br>(Alternatively, it could be a routine request consistent with
<br>the government's longstanding interest in settling Dirty
<br>War-related human rights cases.)
<br>
<br>--------------------------------
<br>The Verdict: "Red Dawn" Unlikely
<br>--------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Despite all of the above, we view the radicalization
<br>scenario as the least likely of the three paths that the
<br>government will take, with a probability of less than five
<br>percent. Even if the Kirchners prefer this approach in their
<br>heart of hearts, circumstances in the wake of the election
<br>give them virtually no margin to implement it. Immediately
<br>after the election, many of the most powerful forces within
<br>the governing coalition began clamoring for more moderate
<br>policies, a more inclusive approach to governance, and
<br>(especially) a larger share of government finances. These
<br>Peronist governors and mayors fared far better than Nestor
<br>did, and they are in no mood to take orders from the
<br>Kirchners. As a source close to Buenos Aires Governor Daniel
<br>Scioli told the CDA, "There are no captive politicians after
<br>these elections." The private sector is similarly
<br>emboldened. As Industrialist Association (UIA) chief Hector
<br>Mendez told us that "deepening the model won't happen. We
<br>just won't allow it." Finally, the anti-Kirchner opposition
<br>is clearly ascendant. These groups will fight GOA efforts to
<br>march Argentina further to the left. Given the current
<br>political climate, they should have the votes to hold the
<br>Kirchners at bay even before the new Congress is seated in
<br>December.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Nor do we believe that Argentina's foreign policy is
<br>becoming more Bolivarian. The GOA has become much less eager
<br>to criticize the USG directly since Barack Obama became
<br>President. CFK wears her affection for our
<br>Commander-in-Chief on her sleeve. In addition, as mentioned
<br>in the next section (para 16), there is new evidence of
<br>concrete GOA efforts to support U.S. foreign policy
<br>objectives in multilateral fora, at least behind the scenes.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) There is another external factor that makes
<br>Argentina's embrace of Bolivarian politics unlikely -- the
<br>growing influence of Brazil here. The local IDB rep,
<br>Brazilian Daniel Oliveira, told econoff recently that
<br>"Argentina has become as important to Brazil as Mexico is to
<br>the United States." With a US$31 billion trade relationship
<br>and more than US$10 billion in Brazilian investment flowing
<br>into the Argentina economy since 1997, Brazil is strongly
<br>engaged here, and is not shy about defending its interests.
<br>The local press has reported that Lula worked the phones in
<br>July 2008 to prevent the Kirchners from abandoning power in
<br>the wake of their failed attempt to push a tax increase on
<br>agricultural exports through Congress. Lula and his
<br>associates will remain an important moderating influence on
<br>the Kirchners.
<br>
<br>¶11. (S/NF) Although we think this scenario's likelihood is
<br>
<br>BUENOS AIR 00000827 003 OF 005
<br>
<br>
<br>limited, it bears mention that it is also the most likely to
<br>lead to political crisis, confrontation, escalating violence,
<br>and CFK's failure to reach the end of her term. We explore
<br>how such a downward spiral might play out, and the likelihood
<br>of this calamitous scenario, in a separate report.
<br>
<br>-------------------------------------------
<br>Scenario Two: The Kirchners Embrace Reform
<br>-------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Some observers expect (and many more hope) that the
<br>Kirchners will reinvent themselves, pursuing a reform-minded
<br>agenda that mollifies Peronist governors, defangs the
<br>opposition, and wins over new foreign friends. A larger
<br>group believes that a rebellious Peronist establishment will
<br>put them on that course, whether they like it or not. Key
<br>policy features of such an approach would include:
<br>
<br>-- Economy: Interventionist-in-Chief Guillermo Moreno is
<br>dismissed, clearing the way for a normalization of the state
<br>statistical institute INDEC (and thus a return to
<br>methodological integrity in the national accounts); GOA makes
<br>deals with the Paris Club and private bondholders left out of
<br>the 2005 debt swap deal and normalizes its relationship with
<br>the IMF, starting with an Article IV Consultation; progress
<br>on outstanding ICSID judgments against Argentina.
<br>
<br>-- Governance: CFK rules more inclusively, coordinating
<br>policies with governors and looking for common ground with
<br>the opposition in the current and next Congress. Government
<br>rolls back agricultural export taxes as a down-payment on its
<br>new conciliatory approach. NK reduces his public profile.
<br>
<br>-- Foreign Policy: Concrete steps benefiting the United
<br>States and non-Bolivarian governments in the hemisphere,
<br>coupled with distancing from Chavez and his allies.
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Proponents of this scenario's likelihood have plenty
<br>of recent evidence to back them up. There is clearly ferment
<br>in the government's approach to economic policy, with a new
<br>Economy Minister on board, powerful (and heretofore
<br>pro-Venezuelan) Planning Minister Julio De Vido now reputed
<br>to be an advocate of pragmatic moderation, and prestigious,
<br>market-oriented advisors (specifically, former Central Banker
<br>and IMF official Mario Blejer) said to be poised to join the
<br>government. The government sacked its statist, corrupt
<br>Transportation Secretary Ricardo Jaime days after the
<br>election, and rumors abound that Moreno, the icon of "market
<br>repression" economics, has become such a political liability
<br>that his days in the government are numbered. Well-placed
<br>sources within the government confirm that change is in the
<br>air. Top Kirchner aide Carlos Zannini indicated that the GOA
<br>would focus almost exclusively on changes on the economic
<br>policy front this month, and influential Buenos Aires
<br>Province Vice-Governor Alberto Balestrini told the CDA last
<br>week that the GOA would roll back agricultural export taxes
<br>on wheat and corn soon.
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) Nor is there any doubt that the political center of
<br>gravity has shifted dramatically in Argentina since the
<br>election. Most of the country's 16 Peronist governors have
<br>reportedly expressed their desire for market-oriented
<br>changes, at least privately. Some former allies, like
<br>ambitious Chubut Governor Mario Das Neves, have broken ranks
<br>with the Kirchners and openly criticize them. Even loyalist
<br>governors like Chaco's Jorge Capitanich have publicly called
<br>for straightening out INDEC and other changes. Faced with
<br>this onslaught from ostensible allies, CFK announced on July
<br>9 (as she has before) that she would convoke the country's
<br>main political and private sector leaders to a process of
<br>dialogue. The following week, she modified the proposed
<br>process to accommodate opposition demands.
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) The GOA's political position is further weakened by
<br>the prospect that it will suffer defections from its ranks in
<br>the current Congress. Of course, the next Congress that
<br>takes office December 10 will be more independent, with the
<br>government losing majorities in both chambers. This will
<br>make it easier for reform-minded groups to push the Kirchners
<br>into accepting elements of their agendas. As Balestrini told
<br>us, the GOA will need to renegotiate and compromise in order
<br>to rule.
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) The GOA has taken a few subtle foreign policy moves
<br>that could be construed as harbingers of a closer
<br>relationship with the United States. After he received a
<br>call on the issue from Secretary Clinton, FM Jorge Taiana
<br>convinced CFK to change the voting instructions of the
<br>Argentine delegation to the International Atomic Energy
<br>Agency, which enabled U.S.-supported candidate Yukiya Amano
<br>
<br>BUENOS AIR 00000827 004 OF 005
<br>
<br>
<br>to win election after a month-long impasse. In a more
<br>prosaic but perhaps symbolically important development, the
<br>CDA received a warm note from CFK expressing regret for her
<br>failure to attend the Mission's Independence Day celebration
<br>and offering best wishes. We had never before received such
<br>a note from either Kirchner.
<br>
<br>-------------------------------------
<br>The Verdict: Don't Bet On A New Leaf
<br>-------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶17. (C) While the reform scenario has gained credence over
<br>the past week, driven primarily by economic policy news and
<br>rumors, we remain skeptical that Nestor and Cristina will
<br>turn into a latter-day incarnation of Ozzie and Harriet,
<br>dispensing moderation and good sense wherever they turn.
<br>Neither Kirchner seems inclined to admit error, even tacitly,
<br>by shifting course so abruptly. A senior official at the
<br>Central Bank told us that Nestor will resist reformist
<br>policies because they would be interpreted as a sign of his
<br>weakness and even irrelevance. If changes come, he argues,
<br>they will come at a time of his choosing. A reformist path
<br>may also strike the Kirchners as politically risky,
<br>distancing them from their most fervent supporters in the
<br>working class, poor "villas," and intelligentsia in deference
<br>to sectors that are at best disloyal and at worst openly
<br>hostile to them.
<br>
<br>¶18. (C) The "forced reform" variant of this scenario seems
<br>somewhat more likely, but not by much. For it to work, one
<br>of two things must happen. Either the Peronist governors
<br>will need to set aside their rivalries and effectively
<br>advocate for a more robust approach to reform than seems
<br>likely, or the bickering, often inept opposition will need to
<br>get its act together and engage the Kirchners as a united
<br>front. Much depends, for example, on whether dissident
<br>Peronists coalesce behind Senator Carlos Reutemann, who has
<br>emerged as a frontrunner for the Peronist presidential
<br>nomination in 2011, and whether Vice President Julio Cobos
<br>can gain some traction in pulling together support from the
<br>Radicals, Civic Coalition, and Socialists. If either of
<br>these two groups works cooperatively over the coming two
<br>months, it is possible that positive changes can come to
<br>Argentina before CFK leaves office in 2011. We don't think
<br>that will happen, however, and estimate the two reform
<br>scenarios' combined probability at no more than twenty
<br>percent.
<br>
<br>---------------------------------
<br>Scenario Three: Muddling Through
<br>---------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶19. (C) In the third scenario, the Kirchners do not
<br>definitively opt for reform or radicalization. Maintaining
<br>the short-term focus that has characterized their six years
<br>in power, they muddle through as best they can, trying to
<br>salvage their political futures or at least to reach the end
<br>of CFK's term in 2011. There may be some positive changes in
<br>this scenario -- one analyst dubs it "reform-lite" -- but the
<br>electoral setback does not ultimately result in a dramatic
<br>course correction. In the words of economist Nicolas
<br>Dujovne, the Kirchners will pursue a strategy of "minimum
<br>reforms, but without collapse." Under this scenario, the
<br>following might happen:
<br>
<br>-- Economy: Lots of policy zigzagging without a clear
<br>direction; Moreno stays, or leaves and is replaced with
<br>another hard-liner; new, "reform-minded" Economy Minister
<br>Boudou changes little, like the Cabinet's previous reformist
<br>also-rans Martin Lousteau and Sergio Massa.
<br>
<br>-- Governance: Cooption of some Peronist governors and
<br>mayors, punishment of others considered to be disloyal.
<br>Stalemate on legislation in Congress. Top-down dialogue
<br>process initiated without intention to compromise.
<br>
<br>-- Foreign Policy: Some private gestures to the USG, but
<br>little movement towards resolution of long-term sources of
<br>friction; no palpable distancing from Chavez's camp or
<br>modification of the GOA's "independent" foreign policy.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---------
<br>For Evidence That Nothing Has Changed, Buy a Newspaper
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---------
<br>
<br>¶20. (C) This status-quo scenario is the clear frontrunner
<br>among our contacts. There is fresh evidence to support it in
<br>every day's harvest of newspapers. The two dominant news
<br>stories since the election, CFK's botched trip to Honduras
<br>and the GOA's response to the H1N1 epidemic here, both
<br>
<br>BUENOS AIR 00000827 005 OF 005
<br>
<br>
<br>suggest that the government's improvisational style and
<br>closed decision-making process remain intact. This in turn
<br>will mean that GOA policies are more likely to develop in
<br>response to the first couple's whims than to a coherent
<br>design. It also means that the government bureaucracy is
<br>unlikely to save the Kirchners from the consequences of their
<br>impulses. For example, CFK went ahead with her ill-advised
<br>trip to Washington and Central America earlier this month
<br>against the advice of her Foreign Ministry. She ended up
<br>achieving no more than Nestor did in December 2007 when he
<br>participated in the Chavez-organized "bungle in the jungle"
<br>in Colombia, in which Nestor and others sat helplessly in the
<br>jungle for days in the futile hope that the FARC would
<br>deliver hostages to them.
<br>
<br>¶21. (C) The opacity of decision-making at the GOA's apex
<br>means that the government will continue to meander hither and
<br>yon, regardless of whether or not it has definitively chosen
<br>a particular direction. The GOA's performance in dealing
<br>with H1N1 flu is a case in point. Although many public
<br>health officials in the GOA are working around the clock to
<br>contain the challenging problem, the government's lack of
<br>internal communication made it look hapless. For example,
<br>upon alighting on Argentine territory after her Central
<br>American jaunt, CFK denounced "fear-mongering" media reports
<br>of 100,000 flu cases in Argentina -- information that had
<br>come from her own health ministry. (The 100,000 number
<br>referred to all flu cases, not just H1N1 flu.) The poor
<br>coordination continues. Over the past weekend, the Mission
<br>found itself in the middle of an unsightly (non-public)
<br>dispute between the federal Ministry of Health and its
<br>counterpart in the Province of Buenos Aires (governed by
<br>Kirchner ally Daniel Scioli) over the destination of
<br>CDC-donated Tamiflu doses, with each accusing the other of
<br>bad faith and subterfuge.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------
<br>The Verdict: More of the Same, But Good Can Happen
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------
<br>
<br>¶22. (C) Like most of our contacts, we think that this untidy
<br>scenario is the most likely outcome. We don't expect the
<br>Kirchners to change, but given the magnitude of their defeat
<br>in the mid-terms, we don't expect the Peronist establishment
<br>or the opposition to back down, either. The Kirchners may
<br>even be able to prevail if their rivals and opponents fail to
<br>unite. Prolonged stalemate on most of the "big" policy
<br>issues seems the most likely outcome of a collision between a
<br>closed, reform-adverse, and politically weakened regime and
<br>disparate political groups that believe that they have a
<br>mandate for reform.
<br>
<br>¶23. (C) This does not mean, however, that no positive change
<br>in this scenario is possible. The Kirchners could take steps
<br>for ulterior motives that turn out to have beneficial
<br>consequences. This has already happened in the post mid-term
<br>era, when Transportation Secretary Ricardo Jaime departed
<br>office soon after the election. One of our contacts
<br>characterized the Kirchners' willingness to cut the
<br>notoriously corrupt official loose as the beginning of a
<br>purge designed to distance them from the shadiest elements of
<br>their regime in an effort to reduce the likelihood that they
<br>themselves could end up in prison. Whatever the reason,
<br>Jaime's removal could lead to policy improvements in the
<br>transportation sector.
<br>
<br>¶24. (C) Nor does it mean that the USG should ignore the
<br>Kirchner regime or give up on it as hopeless. CFK may not
<br>have a grand scheme in mind for her remaining two years in
<br>power, but she clearly would like to associate herself with
<br>President Obama's star power. The intensity of this desire
<br>opens all kinds of opportunities for us, as it did in
<br>Argentina's decisive IAEA vote. As the Kirchners struggle
<br>for political relevance or at least survival, they will be
<br>looking for success stories -- and we should be on guard for
<br>opportunities to induce them to do the right thing. Even if
<br>the Kirchner government is unlikely to resolve every single
<br>outstanding bilateral issue to our satisfaction, we think
<br>that cultivation of the GOA -- CFK in particular -- can lead
<br>to beneficial outcomes for U.S. interests bilaterally,
<br>regionally, and multilaterally.
