<br>Classified By: Pol M/C Josiah Rosenblatt for Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D)
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) SUMMARY. The French determination to explore all
<br>options that could lead to the release of Franco-Colombian
<br>Ingrid Betancourt has led them to support Venezuelan
<br>President Hugo Chavez,s offer to mediate a humanitarian
<br>accord between the Colombian government and FARC guerillas.
<br>MFA officials admit that while the GOF is open to Chavez,s
<br>offer to act as a mediator in the release of FARC hostages,
<br>France will not make any further moves until there is a
<br>gesture of goodwill (proof of life) from the FARC. Since a
<br>September 4 meeting on hostage negotiations between FM
<br>Kouchner and his Colombian counterpart, Sarkozy has invited
<br>President Chavez to France, a move downplayed by the French
<br>MFA. Sarkozy will meet with Colombian president Uribe on the
<br>margins of the UNGA on September 25. Betancourt is high on
<br>the bilateral agenda. COMMENT: Betancourt remains a major
<br>media presence in France and the GOF is under a great deal of
<br>political pressure to show the government "will leave no
<br>stone unturned" to secure her release. END COMMENT AND
<br>SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) On September 6, Poloffs and Deputy Director of
<br>Regional Affairs for S/CT, Marc Norman, met with FM
<br>Kouchner's Counselor for Latin American and Asian affairs,
<br>Evan Nguyen Binh; DAS equivalent for South America, Michel
<br>Pinard; and Colombia/Venezuela desk officer, Daniel Paradisi.
<br>MFA representatives described the political pressure to
<br>obtain this hostage release. They noted that while they are
<br>willing to press for negotiations, the French require some
<br>advance positive movement by the Revolutionary Armed Forces
<br>of Colombia (FARC). Referring to the Colombian release of
<br>200 FARC prisoners in June, the French noted that they have
<br>not seen any steps toward negotiations by the FARC.
<br>Specifically, the French seek proof of life as a requirement
<br>for negotiations. The MFA representatives characterized
<br>Venezuelan President Chavez's offer to act as a mediator
<br>between the FARC and the Colombian government as an
<br>opportunity while noting they do not have a precise
<br>understanding of what Chavez can do. They highlighted the
<br>intense political pressure on the French government to obtain
<br>Betancourt's safe return and noted that they are not able to
<br>turn down offers that might result in a hostage release. Eva
<br>Nguyen Binh asked whether the U.S. might consider the release
<br>of Simon Trinidad to the FARC. Poloffs and S/CT Deputy
<br>Director Marc Norman unequivocally rejected this suggestion.
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) French President Sarkozy called Chavez over the
<br>weekend of September 8 to discuss the hostage situation.
<br>Sarkozy,s call followed an August 29 call to Chavez during
<br>which the two presidents decided to "stay in as close contact
<br>as possible." Statements from Venezuela report that Sarkozy
<br>invited Chavez to France, "where he would welcome Chavez as a
<br>friend." While MFA officials admit that a trip was discussed
<br>and could occur in the next few months, neither the Elysee
<br>Palace nor the MFA have said so publicly telling reporters
<br>only that Chavez and Sarkozy discussed their willingness to
<br>travel to Colombia. Chavez last visited France in 2005.
<br>Focused on securing Betancourt's release, Foreign Minister
<br>Kouchner told France Info radio that Chavez could "bring his
<br>personal touch even if he is a very controversial. But after
<br>all, all goodwill is welcome and we must not leave any stone
<br>unturned." MFA Desk Officer Daniel Paradisi acknowledged
<br>that Sarkozy initiated the second call which he described as
<br>a means to an end. He added "it is hard to be friends with
<br>Venezuela."
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) The French continue their dialogue with the
<br>Colombians as well with a Sarkozy call to Colombian President
<br>Uribe on August 30. FM Kouchner followed by meeting
<br>Colombian Foreign Minister Araujo on September 4. Uribe and
<br>Sarkozy are scheduled to meet on September 25 on the margins
<br>of the UN General Assembly to discuss the hostage situation
<br>according to MFA contacts.
