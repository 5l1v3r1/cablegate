<br>SUBJECT: AL-MASRI CASE -- CHANCELLERY AWARE OF USG CONCERNS 
<br> 
<br>REF: A. BERLIN 230 
<br> 
<br>     ¶B. BERLIN 200 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: DCM John M. Koenig for Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (S/NF) In a February 6 discussion with German Deputy 
<br>National Security Adviser Rolf Nikel, the DCM reiterated our 
<br>strong concerns about the possible issuance of international 
<br>arrest warrants in the al-Masri case.  The DCM noted that the 
<br>reports in the German media of the discussion on the issue 
<br>between the Secretary and FM Steinmeier in Washington were 
<br>not accurate, in that the media reports suggest the USG was 
<br>not troubled by developments in the al-Masri case.  The DCM 
<br>emphasized that this was not the case and that issuance of 
<br>international arrest warrants would have a negative impact on 
<br>our bilateral relationship.  He reminded Nikel of the 
<br>repercussions to U.S.-Italian bilateral relations in the wake 
<br>of a similar move by Italian authorities last year. 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (S/NF) The DCM pointed out that our intention was not to 
<br>threaten Germany, but rather to urge that the German 
<br>Government weigh carefully at every step of the way the 
<br>implications for relations with the U.S.  We of course 
<br>recognized the independence of the German judiciary, but 
<br>noted that a decision to issue international arrest warrants 
<br>or extradition requests would require the concurrence of the 
<br>German Federal Government, specifically the MFA and the 
<br>Ministry of Justice (MOJ).  The DCM said our initial 
<br>indications had been that the German federal authorities 
<br>would not allow the warrants to be issued, but that 
<br>subsequent contacts led us to believe this was not the case. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (S/NF) Nikel also underscored the independence of the 
<br>German judiciary, but confirmed that the MFA and MOJ would 
<br>have a procedural role to play.  He said the case was subject 
<br>to political, as well as judicial, scrutiny.  From a judicial 
<br>standpoint, the facts are clear, and the Munich prosecutor 
<br>has acted correctly.  Politically speaking, said Nikel, 
<br>Germany would have to examine the implications for relations 
<br>with the U.S.  At the same time, he noted our political 
<br>differences about how the global war on terrorism should be 
<br>waged, for example on the appropriateness of the Guantanamo 
<br>facility and the alleged use of renditions. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (S/NF) Nikel also cited intense pressure from the 
<br>Bundestag and the German media.  The German federal 
<br>Government must consider the "entire political context," said 
<br>Nikel.  He assured the DCM that the Chancellery is well aware 
<br>of the bilateral political implications of the case, but 
<br>added that this case "will not be easy."  The Chancellery 
<br>would nonetheless try to be as constructive as possible. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (S/NF) The DCM pointed out that the USG would likewise 
<br>have a difficult time in managing domestic political 
<br>implications if international arrest warrants are issued.  He 
<br>reiterated our concerns and expressed the hope that the 
<br>Chancellery would keep us informed of further developments in 
<br>the case, so as to avoid surprises.  Nikel undertook to do 
<br>so, but reiterated that he could not, at this point "promise 
<br>that everything will turn out well."
