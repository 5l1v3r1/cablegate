<br>REF: LA PAZ 0406 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador David Greenlee for reasons 1.4 (B) and (D). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Minister of the Presidency Juan Ramos de la 
<br>Quintana told the Ambassador February 15 that the GOB wanted 
<br>USG agencies to continue their programs in the Chapare, 
<br>though implementation methods may need to be modified. He 
<br>acknowledged that the GOB's counternarcotics policies were 
<br>still being formulated, but assured that the GOB's commitment 
<br>to combat the illicit drug trade would be met and that the 
<br>cocalero federations did not speak on the GOB's behalf. 
<br>Quintana said the depenalization and industrialization of 
<br>coca was a priority for President Evo Morales. The Minister 
<br>said cocaleros would be paid to eradicate coca in the 
<br>national parks while other negotiated alternatives would be 
<br>pursued with the cocalero federations. On interdiction, 
<br>Quintana asked for greater information sharing from the DEA 
<br>on organized criminal networks. When the Ambassador raised 
<br>objections about anti-U.S. rhetoric creeping into GOB 
<br>statements, the Minister blamed the Bolivian press for 
<br>distorting reality. Quintana was forthright, somewhat 
<br>confused, and suspicious of USG programs. The new GOB may or 
<br>may not be disposed ideologically to work with us; but it 
<br>certainly does not yet have the internal cohesion or 
<br>coherence to cooperate effectively. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------- 
<br>FIRST MEETING WITH MINISTER OF THE PRESIDENCY QUINTANA 
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) At our request, the Ambassador, DCM, and Econ/Pol 
<br>Chief met the evening of February 15 with Minister of the 
<br>Presidency Juan Ramos de la Quintana to seek clarification of 
<br>GOB policy regarding USG programs in the Chapare. Newspaper 
<br>headlines that morning carried the cocalero federations' 
<br>decision to throw out USG agencies operating in the region, a 
<br>position supported by GOB spokesman Alex Contreras (see 
<br>reftel). The Ambassador told Quintana that the federations' 
<br>statements--Evo Morales remains their titular head--and the 
<br>apparent presidential endorsement had sparked considerable 
<br>confusion about the GOB's intent. The Ambassador suggested 
<br>that if eradication is to be stopped and USG involvement in 
<br>the Chapare ended, the new policy should be communicated 
<br>officially and we could begin shutting off our multi-million 
<br>dollar assistance programs now. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Quintana responded that he appreciated open, frank 
<br>exchanges free of entangling rhetoric and underscored the 
<br>GOB's continuing need for U.S. help on the counternarcotics 
<br>front. But, he added, that message is not being clearly 
<br>communicated because "...we do not yet have an agreement 
<br>between the GOB and all the relevant actors on this issue." 
<br>At the same time, he said the cocalero federations did not 
<br>speak on behalf of the GOB, which has a stronger commitment 
<br>than previous administrations and wants to "...break the 
<br>stigma that Bolivia protects narcotraffickers." 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) In that vein, Quintana claimed the GOB had a sound 
<br>strategy to combat the illegal drug trade: compartmentalizing 
<br>the problem into "clear chapters" for greater enforcement 
<br>efficiency on the one hand, and depenalizing coca for 
<br>industrialization and commercialization on the other. 
<br>"Depenalization is a complex but necessary task because we 
<br>want coca to have commercial and industrial purposes. This 
<br>is an explicit priority for the President," he said, adding 
<br>that the GOB would meet next week with EU representatives to 
<br>discuss the terms of the demand study required for domestic 
<br>purposes. (Note: While not stated, the implication was that 
<br>the EU study should include consideration of Bolivian 
<br>domestic demand to include coca necessary for these 
<br>yet-only-imagined industrial purposes. End Note). 
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>A NEW APPROACH TO ERADICATION AND INTERDICTION 
<br>--------------------------------------------- - 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Quintana said the GOB would preserve the best of 
<br>previous GOB policies, including eradication, but implement 
<br>them differently. The first priority, he offered, is to 
<br>limit additional cultivation, although he added curiously 
<br>that the GOB would not strictly interpret the 3200 hectare 
<br>limit for Chapare cultivation set aside by the October 2004 
<br>agreement. He assured that eradication would continue in the 
<br>two problem areas of the Carrasco National Park and the 
<br>Yungas de Vandiola, saying that he would travel to the region 
<br>himself this weekend to meet with cocaleros, but noted that 
<br>existing military eradicators would work only in the areas 
<br>where they can proceed peacefully, with negotiation--an 
<br>open-ended concept--the rule in more conflictive zones. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Quintana saw no change in the GOB's willingness to 
<br>cooperate with the USG on interdiction and noted that the DEA 
<br>was welcome to stay in the Chapare. The GOB's non-political 
<br>approach to interdiction was exemplified, he said, by the 
<br>non-partisan appointment of a new chief for the 
<br>counternarcotics police. The Minister asserted that these 
<br>units had committed human rights violations in the past, a 
<br>situation this GOB would not tolerate. The Ambassador 
<br>retorted that any such incidents did not involve DEA agents 
<br>and that we shared Quintana's concern about human rights. 
<br>Quintana went on to say that he was not critical of the 
<br>results obtained by interdiction efforts, but of the methods 
<br>used to obtain them. "In the past, because of the weakness 
<br>of Bolivian institutions, USG involvement appeared more like 
<br>intervention than cooperation. We ask that your cooperation 
<br>be transparent, conducted with consideration and respect." 
<br>While expressing a desire to be autonomous in their 
<br>interdiction operations, he acknowledged the need for the 
<br>USG's offer of helicopters and other equipment "in the spirit 
<br>of shared responsibility," and said the GOB had no plans to 
<br>alter the DEA's role in the drug enforcement arena. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) When the Ambassador asked what immediate changes in 
<br>the interdiction efforts were contemplated, Quintana observed 
<br>that the GOB had little understanding of how criminal 
<br>organizations operated in Bolivia. "All we get," he 
<br>complained, "are statistics on drugs intercepted and labs 
<br>destroyed, but nothing on Bolivian criminal organizations and 
<br>their links to other countries. This makes us suspicious 
<br>that the counter-narcotics efforts are not sufficiently 
<br>explained to the GOB or the Bolivian people." He also 
<br>lamented that the Bolivian anti-drug unit (FELCN) did not 
<br>have an institute to study criminal organizations. The 
<br>Ambassador replied that maintaining the integrity of 
<br>international criminal investigations was crucial but that he 
<br>would raise the issue with the DEA. 
<br>
<br>------------------- 
<br>INTELLIGENCE ISSUES 
<br>------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) The Minister noted that the GOB wanted its 
<br>intelligence services to respond better to the needs of the 
<br>GOB and was suspicious of their relationship with the DEA. 
<br>(Note: Quintana associated intelligence cooperation only with 
<br>the DEA and the counternarcotics effort. End Note.) The 
<br>Minister said that he wanted "a more democratic intelligence 
<br>service" in the future. The Ambassador noted USG interest in 
<br>promoting intelligence cooperation on counter-terrorism 
<br>issues as well, given regional threats in the Tri-Border 
<br>region and elsewhere, and suggested a subsequent meeting to 
<br>discuss these issues in greater depth. 
<br>

<br>MUTUAL DESIRE FOR CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>
<br>LA PAZ 00000417 003 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) The Ambassador expressed concern about anti-U.S. 
<br>rhetoric creeping into GOB statements and policies and warned 
<br>that gratuitous insults did not encourage strong bilateral 
<br>ties. Talking about imaginary U.S. military bases in 
<br>Paraguay "as you have done publicly, Mr. Minister," does 
<br>little to build confidence. Noting the billions of U.S. 
<br>dollars of assistance in the past few decades, including the 
<br>nearly one million in disaster assistance for Bolivian flood 
<br>victims, the Ambassador observed that the USG would sometimes 
<br>appreciate a good word or thank you, something President 
<br>Morales notably forgot to offer in his conversation with 
<br>President Bush. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) While acknowledging that the GOB probably had no 
<br>intention of ratifying an Article 98 agreement, the 
<br>Ambassador asked that the GOB respect the U.S. position 
<br>without intentionally mischaracterizing it and claiming that 
<br>the U.S. sought to shield its soldiers from justice. The 
<br>issue is one of jurisdiction, not immunity, he said, and 
<br>noted that over 100 countries had signed Article 98 
<br>agreements with the U.S. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
<br>ATTACKING THE PRESS AND RE-ORIENTING USG ASSISTANCE 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Quintana, perhaps a little disingenuously, said he 
<br>shared the Ambassador's concerns about poisonous rhetoric, 
<br>but blamed the press for distorting the GOB's comments about 
<br>the U.S. He described the Bolivian press as unprofessional 
<br>and perverse because it was too closely associated with 
<br>political parties. At the same time, Quintana said the U.S. 
<br>was counterproductively omnipresent in Bolivian 
<br>institutions--an ironic exageration in view of reportedly 
<br>increasing Venezuelan and Cuban presence--and suggested that 
<br>our assistance was too dispersed to be strategically 
<br>effective. He lamented the uneven economic development 
<br>throughout the country, noting that Potosi remained in abject 
<br>poverty while Santa Cruz was developing fast "with its 
<br>radical federalist ideas," and suggested a U.S. Corps of 
<br>Engineers road project uniting the country would be a smart, 
<br>focussed investment. The Ambassador reminded Quintana that 
<br>the GOB nixed expanded military help by attacking us on 
<br>Article 98. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Comment: Quintana seemed forthright, a little 
<br>confused, and abidingly suspicious of USG intentions. He 
<br>exposed inaccurate views about existing USG programs, a 
<br>strong ideological bent on coca, and a disturbing 
<br>disaffection with the media--particularly disturbing since 
<br>the MAS is considering laws to limit freedom of press. His 
<br>most revealing comment was that the GOB is still struggling 
<br>to clarify its policies, including on counternarcotics. 
<br>Whether the new GOB wants to work with us is an open 
<br>question; whether it can work with us is equally perplexing. 
<br>End Comment.
