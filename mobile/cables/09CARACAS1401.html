<br>
<br>
<br>Classified By: Political Counselor Robin D. Meyer, 
<br>for reasons 1.4 (B) and (D). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: In an October 28 breakfast meeting with 
<br>the Confederacion de Asociaciones Israelitas Venezolanas 
<br>(CAIV) Board of Directors, XXXXXXXXXXXX, said
<br> he privately encouraged Brazilian senators to allow
<br>Venezuela to join MERCOSUR. At the same time, Jewish 
<br>community leaders told PolCouns the Venezuelan government's 
<br>(GBRV's) attacks and "double-talk," constant criticism of 
<br>Israel, growing alliance with Iran, and increasing 
<br>limitations on freedom of speech contribute to a heightened 
<br>sense of vulnerability by the Jewish community. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>------------------- 
<br>SUPPORTING MERCOSUR 
<br>------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX said he had spoken by phone
<br>to a Brazilian senator and had privately urged the Brazilian
<br>Senate on October 27 to allow Venezuela to join MERCOSUR,
<br>believing that membership in the organization would help
<br> promote and defend human rights. Given the ongoing sense
<br>of threat, CAIV members agreed on the need for close
<br>relations with the U.S. and other Embassies as a form
<br>of diplomatic protection for the Jewish community. 
<br>
<br>------------------------ 
<br>MEDIA ATTACKS SINCE 2004 
<br>------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX said "2004 was a turning
<br>point in Venezuela," when Chavez began 
<br>referring to support of certain Jewish leaders for the 2002 
<br>post-coup government as justification for verbal and physical 
<br>attacks against the Jewish community and synagogues. 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX said anti-Semitic programs and articles
<br>have been regular features of government-owned media since
<br>2004, and "international anti-Jewish campaigns have been
<br>tailored for use domestically." XXXXXXXXXXXX emphasized
<br>that the anti-Semitism is "government-sponsored." He noted that Emilio 
<br>Silva, the author of a January 20 article on the government 
<br>website aporrea.org which called for violent demonstrations 
<br>at the Tiferet synagogue just 10 days before the synagogue 
<br>was attacked, is still teaching at the pro-government 
<br>Bolivarian University of Venezuela. They also noted that 
<br>there are regular government media attacks on Miranda State 
<br>Governor Henrique Capriles Rodonski as a Jew, despite the 
<br>fact that, while of Jewish ancestry, he is Christian. 
<br>
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br>CONSIDERED FOREIGN, NOT VENEZUELAN 
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) CAIV continues to be in weekly contact with senior 
<br>Ministry of Foreign Affairs official Temir Porras, and 
<br>occasionally meets with Minister of Foreign Affairs Nicolas 
<br>Maduro; they last met with him three months ago. They noted 
<br>the irony of having the Foreign Ministry, rather than the 
<br>Interior Ministry, as their designated GBRV interlocutor, 
<br>which emphasizes the GBRV's view of the Jewish community as 
<br>"foreign" rather than Venezuelan. While Chavez's rhetoric 
<br>once clearly differentiated criticism of Israel from that of 
<br>the Venezuelan Jewish community, since 2004 they believe he 
<br>has merged his anti-Zionist views with anti-Semitic ones. 
<br>(Note: Chavez has adamantly denied that he or his government 
<br>is anti-Semitic. End Note.) They pointed to repeated 
<br>"double-talk" from the GBRV, CAIV had a cordial discussion 
<br>with former GBRV official Jose Vicente Rangel, and then he 
<br>published a virulently anti-Semitic op-ed article; the GBRV 
<br>admitted that Emilio Silva's January 20 article on 
<br>aporrea.org was anti-Semitic and a "mistake," but took no 
<br>action against him. XXXXXXXXXXXX noted that the charge of having 
<br>an arms cache, which was used as justification for the 2004 
<br>searches of the Club Hebraica, has never been officially and 
<br>fully resolved. In spite of repeated requests by CAIV, court 
<br>officials claim they are "unable to find the necessary 
<br>documents to close the case." 
<br>

<br>CARACAS 00001401 002.2 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>VENEZUELA'S RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL AND IRAN 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Members of the CAIV Board said they have felt 
<br>"orphaned" since the expulsion of the Israeli Ambassador and 
<br>the breaking of diplomatic relations between the two 
<br>countries. XXXXXXXXXXXX said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had 
<br>issued a ban on visas for Israeli citizens. While grateful 
<br>that the Canadian Embassy was taking on Israel's consular 
<br>responsibilities (ref C), many members lamented that it was 
<br>taking a long time to set up the new operation. (Note: Both 
<br>the CAIV members and the Canadian Deputy Chief of Mission 
<br>have attributed the delay to the training needed by the 
<br>individual Israel selected to serve as its consular agent. 
<br>The person had previously served as a receptionist at the 
<br>Israeli Embassy. XXXXXXXXXXXX said Israel's choice
<br>of this person was probably intended to keep Israel's profile
<br>low. End note.) 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) The CAIV leadership was also very concerned about 
<br>the growing relationship between Iran and Venezuela. 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX thinks the GBRV "wants to use the treatment of 
<br>the Jewish community in Iran as a model" for Venezuela, and 
<br>there was widespread agreement among CAIV leaders that 
<br>President Chavez's close alliance with Iranian President 
<br>Ahmadinejad did not bode well for the Venezuelan Jewish 
<br>community. Many members expressed deep concern about Iranian 
<br>activities in the country, citing the lack of transparency at 
<br>the international Maiquetia airport in Caracas on flights to 
<br>and from Iran and the suspiciously inefficient Iranian 
<br>factories for bicycles. "What are these factories really 
<br>producing?" asked one CAIV member. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>A DETERIORATING ENVIRONMENT 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Several CAIV members noted the effect of the 
<br>decreasing democratic space on freedom of religion.
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX said that while there was freedom of religion, 
<br>there was not freedom of expression. "When there are 
<br>restrictions on freedom of speech you do not have freedom of 
<br>religion," he said. CAIV members are also concerned about 
<br>the effect of the new Education Law (ref B) on the Jewish day 
<br>school. To a great extent, many members of CAIV agreed, 
<br>religious freedom cannot be separated from the general state 
<br>of human rights, and "the horizon is dark." Even though the 
<br>number of Jews in Venezuela is declining as people leave the 
<br>country, the threat to the community will remain, one member 
<br>said, because of the prominence of many Jews in business, 
<br>education, and Venezuelan society. 
<br>
<br>------- 
<br>COMMENT 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) The Jewish community's quiet support for Venezuela's 
<br>entry into MERCOSUR suggests that it will be better protected 
<br>by having Venezuela part of an alliance of states pledged to 
<br>the Democracy Charter than by having Venezuela left only to 
<br>its partnership with the "revolutionary" ALBA countries. 
<br>This conclusion is similar to that expressed by opposition 
<br>Mayor of Caracas Antonio Ledezma (ref A), who told Brazilian 
<br>legislators that Chavez was more dangerous isolated than if 
<br>brought into an organization of democratic countries.
