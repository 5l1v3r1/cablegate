<br>SUBJECT: MUBARAK DISCUSSES BACK SURGERY, GAMAL AS 
<br>PERFECTIONIST 
<br>
<br>Classified By: ECPO Minister-Counselor William R. Stewart 
<br>for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) During his January 6 meeting with the Ambassador 
<br>and visiting Congressman Steven Israel (D-NY), President 
<br>Mubarak described his June 2004 back surgery in Germany to 
<br>repair a slipped disc (he stressed it was not a herniated 
<br>disc). Mubarak said that the opening made in his back was 
<br>"very small," that he was in surgery for one-and-a-half 
<br>hours, and that after the operation, he had felt no pain. 
<br>"The next day, I was able to walk." He explained that during 
<br>the time he was sedated, the Prime Minister (Atef Obeid) was 
<br>"in charge." He added that when in Cairo, he undertakes a 
<br>daily exercise regime in the afternoons, but when he goes to 
<br>Sharm, "I just relax -- no exercise." 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) Throughout the meeting, Mubarak was expansive and 
<br>in fine humor. He rose easily from his seat several times to 
<br>point out activity on the golf course and to be photographed 
<br>with his visitors. He engaged the visitors extensively on 
<br>the topic of food, stressing that his favorite fare is 
<br>Egyptian popular breakfast dishes, such as tamiya (felafel) 
<br>and foul (beans). He ordered up a huge tray of freshly made 
<br>tamiya sandwiches for lunch, and lustily consumed several. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) Mubarak also offered insights into the character of 
<br>his younger son, Gamal, whom he described as a perfectionist 
<br>from childhood. "As a schoolboy, if I gave him a notebook 
<br>with one line that was not straight, he would throw a fit and 
<br>demand a new one," Mubarak laughed. Furthermore, Gamal is 
<br>"idealistic" and "punctual." Mubarak added, "If he (Gamal) 
<br>says, 'meet me for lunch at 2:00,' he means 2:00. Set your 
<br>watch by it." 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) During the two-and-a-half hour long meeting at his 
<br>golf course retreat in Sharm El-Sheikh, mostly outdoors on a 
<br>breezy veranda, Mubarak on several occasions seemed to have 
<br>more than his usual difficulty in hearing. Nonetheless, he 
<br>initiated several phone calls. He also displayed one 
<br>apparent lapse in memory in telling Congressman Israel that 
<br>Gamal is forty-one years old; he is in fact forty-four (born 
<br>December 27, 1963, according to leadership profile 20320807).
