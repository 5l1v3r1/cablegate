<br>Summary 
<br>- - - - - 
<br>
<br>2.(S) Frances Townsend, Assistant to the President for 
<br>Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, met with President 
<br>Saleh in Aden on October 22 to discuss mutual cooperation in 
<br>the War on Terror. During the meeting, Saleh accepted 
<br>Townsend's request for USG interrogation of Jamal al-Badawi, 
<br>convicted architect of the bombing of the USS Cole. Saleh 
<br>blamed "aging agents" in the Political Security Organization 
<br>(PSO) for inadequate cooperation, asked the USG to pressure 
<br>regional Gulf countries to stop their support of southern 
<br>"secessionist" movements, accepted Townsend's offer of USG 
<br>assistance in preparation of counterterrorism and cash 
<br>courier laws, and agreed to the need for joint operations to 
<br>combat terrorism outside Yemen. Saleh also warned against 
<br>the threat of Iran, specifically with regard to its role 
<br>inside Iraq, and promised to do more to curb the flow of 
<br>young Yemeni men going to fight in Iraq. The meeting was 
<br>generally a constructive one, with the Yemeni President 
<br>making some positive commitments. Post will continue to work 
<br>with the ROYG to ensure these commitments are not forgotten. 
<br>End Summary 
<br>
<br>Jamal "He is Under my Microscope" al-Badawi and Friends 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>3.(S) Frances Townsend, Assistant to the President for 
<br>Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, met with President 
<br>Ali Abdullah Saleh in Aden on October 22 to discuss mutual 
<br>cooperation in the War on Terror. During the lunch portion 
<br>of the meeting, also attended by the Foreign Minister, the 
<br>Governor of Aden, and a member of Parliament, she asked for 
<br>an update on the status of Jamal al-Badawi, convicted 
<br>architect of the bombing of the USS Cole (ref B). The 
<br>President confirmed al-Badawi's release, clarifying that he 
<br>is under house arrest, living and working on his farm near 
<br>Aden, while the ROYG closely monitors him. Saleh added that 
<br>while Yemeni authorities pursued al-Badawi, the ROYG was 
<br>transmitting messages to him "promising" that if he turned 
<br>himself in, his "situation would get better." Saleh said he 
<br>personally met with al-Badawi "two weeks ago" and had a frank 
<br>discussion with him. "Al-Badawi promised to give up 
<br>terrorism and I told him that his actions damaged Yemen and 
<br>its image; he began to understand," Saleh said. 
<br>
<br>4.(S) Townsend expressed dismay over al-Badawi's release and 
<br>asked for USG access to interrogate him. Saleh told Townsend 
<br>not to worry, "he is under my microscope," but had no 
<br>objections to her request, reiterating numerous times that 
<br>interested USG entities could interrogate al-Badawi by 
<br>coordinating with the Political Security Organization (PSO). 
<br>
<br>5.(S) Saleh specifically mentioned two other escapees that 
<br>remain at large: Abdullah al-Wadi'i and Nasr al-Wahishi. He 
<br>said al-Wahishi had taken the place of Abu Ali as head of 
<br>al-Qaeda in Yemen. Townsend reiterated USG concern over the 
<br>ROYG's house arrest system, with a reference to the cases of 
<br>Ibrahim Makri and Mansur al-Bahani, both of whom were linked 
<br>to terrorist activity while under house arrest. 
<br>
<br>Weapons Trafficking: You Can't Make This Stuff Up 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>6.(C) As Townsend began to ask Saleh about his efforts to 
<br>combat weapons trafficking, Saleh interrupted her to invite 
<br>one of Yemen's top three weapons traffickers, Faris Mana'a, 
<br>into the lunch meeting. When Mana'a, who met with the 
<br>President earlier in the day, entered the room, Saleh 
<br>jokingly addressed the Embassy Assistant Legal Attach 
<br>(Legatt), saying, "hey FBI, if he does not behave properly, 
<br>
<br>you can take him... back to Washington in Townsend's plane or 
<br>to Guantanamo." The Legatt replied, "we could put both 
<br>Mana'a and al-Badawi on the plane;" however, the translator 
<br>did not report this to Saleh, making it unlikely that the 
<br>President heard the Legatt's reply. Meanwhile, Presidential 
<br>staff provided Mana'a with a chair at the table. Saleh 
<br>explained that the ROYG had recently confiscated a shipment 
<br>of "pistols" from Mana'a and given them to the military. 
<br>Townsend lightheartedly commented, "he has donated weapons to 
<br>the nation's military -- he can be considered a patriot now." 
<br>Saleh responded with laughter, saying, "no, he is a double 
<br>agent -- he also gave weapons to the al-Houthi rebels." The 
<br>President said the Ministry of Defense was the only entity in 
<br>Yemen authorized to purchase weapons. (Comment: If the 
<br>President,s statement were an accurate portrayal of the 
<br>situation, arms dealers would effectively be out of business. 
<br>Saleh's comment has been made to Post numerous times before. 
<br>This, and Mana'a's presence at the Palace, raises serious 
<br>questions about the President's commitment to stopping 
<br>weapons trafficking. Mana'a also runs a construction company 
<br>and a petroleum services business, with contracts in Iraq. 
<br>His ties to Saleh may extend beyond money made from the 
<br>weapons trade. End Comment) 
<br>
<br>7.(C) Saleh said the new weapons ban (ref C) in Yemen's major 
<br>cities had been a success, receiving a surprisingly positive 
<br>public response. He specified that in the past month 45,000 
<br>pieces of weaponry had been collected. The Governor of Aden 
<br>added that his city was "100% clean of weapons." Saleh 
<br>expressed a desire to "follow the United States example" of 
<br>licensing guns. When asked by the Legatt if he was going to 
<br>expand the weapons ban outside major cities, Saleh responded 
<br>that it is a "step-by-step" process. 
<br>
<br>PSO: The Old Guard is the Problem 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>8.(S) Townsend complimented Yemen's National Security Bureau, 
<br>saying, "it has done good work, despite its youth," yet 
<br>complained of a lack of cooperation from the PSO with the 
<br>USG. Saleh replied that his proposed constitutional 
<br>amendments (ref A) were the first step in addressing this 
<br>problem. At Foreign Minister al-Qirbi's insistence, Saleh 
<br>elaborated upon his answer, adding that, "although the PSO 
<br>has firm orders to cooperate and respond quickly, its agents 
<br>are aging," alluding to PSO Head, Ghalib Mutahi Qamish. 
<br>(Note: Qamish has been a topic of (sometimes tense) 
<br>discussion between Townsend and Saleh in the past. End Note) 
<br>
<br>The Gulf Factor: Fueling Southern Unrest 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>9.(S) While Saleh claimed the situation in the rebellious 
<br>northern Saada governorate was "very calm," he expressed 
<br>apprehension over the unrest in the South. The President 
<br>asked the USG to pressure countries funding southern 
<br>opposition, saying, "it is important that Yemen not reach a 
<br>state of instability. We need your support." Townsend 
<br>replied, "you do not even have to think about it. Of course 
<br>we support Yemen." 
<br>
<br>10.(S) Saleh asserted that neighboring Arab countries were 
<br>intent on destabilizing his country by supporting the 
<br>southern "secessionist" movement, "not because they have 
<br>anything against Yemen, but because we are following the 
<br>United States' democracy model, and they do not want a 
<br>democracy in the region." He specifically referred to Crown 
<br>Prince Sultan of Saudi Arabia, but inculpated other Gulf 
<br>countries as well. According to Saleh, Gulf Islamic 
<br>organizations are funding the opposition in the South and 
<br>supporting secessionist movement leaders living in Oman, 
<br>Egypt, and Saudi Arabia. He said some of those regional 
<br>Islamic organizations had links to the radical factions 
<br>within the Islamist opposition party Islah - calling them 
<br>"jihadists, salafis, and al-Qaeda." (Note: Islah is the 
<br>largest opposition party in Yemen and is largely recognized 
<br>as moderate. It includes radical factions that are 
<br>considered to be a minority. End Note) 
<br>
<br>USG Support: CT, Cash Courier Law and Joint Operations 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>- - - - - 
<br>
<br>
<br>11.(C) Townsend asked about the progress of Yemen's draft 
<br>counterterrorism (CT) law. Saleh answered, "it has come a 
<br>long way, but we have not yet fully achieved our goals." 
<br>Townsend offered USG technical assistance in drafting the law 
<br>and training for its implementation, which Saleh casually 
<br>accepted. (Note: The Minister of Legal Affairs recently 
<br>rejected an offer for the same assistance (ref D). The lack 
<br>of an effective CT law sometimes leaves the ROYG without a 
<br>legal basis to hold terrorists. Post views passage of a 
<br>comprehensive CT Law as a significant step in strengthening 
<br>counterterrorism bilateral relations. End Note) 
<br>
<br>12.(C) Townsend recommended a cash courier law to strengthen 
<br>Yemen's efforts at combating terrorism and proposed USG 
<br>assistance with the drafting of this law as well, which Saleh 
<br>also nonchalantly accepted. (Comment: Saleh's informal 
<br>manner makes it unclear how resolute he was in accepting, yet 
<br>it is certain that he did not reject the offers made by 
<br>Townsend and generally agreed to her proposals. End Comment) 
<br>
<br>13.(S) Townsend said USG agencies want to work with the ROYG 
<br>on counterterrorism outside, not just inside, Yemen. Saleh 
<br>agreed. He noted that Usama bin Laden's personal bodyguards 
<br>are all Yemeni, alluding to the need for USG-ROYG cooperation 
<br>in the tribal areas between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Saleh 
<br>added that "violence by governments is not always the 
<br>answer," and asked for greater USG assistance in development. 
<br>(Note: Yemen is a beneficiary of significant non-CT aid 
<br>through the Middle East Partnership Initiative, the US 
<br>Department of Agriculture Food for Progress Program and, as 
<br>of November 1, returns to the Millennium Challenge 
<br>Cooperation's Threshold Country Program. End Note) 
<br>
<br>Iran, Iran, Iran 
<br>- - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>14.(S) Throughout the meeting, Saleh repeatedly asked about 
<br>Iran and the USG's position vis-a-vis the country. Townsend 
<br>replied that if Iran does not get serious, the USG will be 
<br>forced to return to the United Nations to request more 
<br>sanctions. 
<br>
<br>15.(S) Saleh warned Townsend about Qatar's relationship with 
<br>Iran, cautioning that although the two countries are allies, 
<br>Iran could turn on Qatar at any time. Townsend agreed, 
<br>saying she had relayed the same message to Qatar, and asked 
<br>Saleh if he had spoken to the Qatari Emir about this matter. 
<br>Saleh responded, "of course." He also asked Townsend to 
<br>deliver a verbatim message to President Bush about Iran: "you 
<br>must discipline and tame a child when he is young." 
<br>
<br>16.(S) On Iraq, Saleh asked Townsend to tell President Bush 
<br>that, "Maliki represents Iran in Iraq, he is worse than 
<br>Ahmedinejad." He repeatedly referred to Maliki as a "dog," 
<br>although the embarrassed interpreter substituted the word 
<br>"he." 
<br>
<br>Foreign Fighters to Iraq 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>17.(S) Townsend expressed USG concern over young Yemeni men 
<br>going to fight in Iraq and asked Saleh to do more to tackle 
<br>the problem. Saleh replied that it is an extremely difficult 
<br>task, as Yemeni men do not travel directly to Iraq. They 
<br>first travel to Cairo, Damascus, or Riyadh, making it 
<br>practically impossible to track who is traveling to Baghdad. 
<br>Townsend suggested publicly announcing airport interrogations 
<br>of young men suspected of going to Iraq. She noted that the 
<br>fear of getting caught itself might stem the flow of foreign 
<br>fighters. Saleh agreed and said the ROYG will try to do 
<br>more. (Note: Yemeni security services currently try to 
<br>scrutinize young male Yemeni travelers, particularly those 
<br>traveling to Damascus, as a means to identify foreign 
<br>fighters, and sometimes deny them travel. End Note) 
<br>
<br>Letters Exchanged 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>18.(C) Townsend delivered a letter from President Bush to 
<br>President Saleh. The letter was read by both Saleh and 
<br>Foreign Minister al-Qirbi. Saleh responded to it by 
<br>
<br>emphasizing Yemen's willingness to "cooperate with everything 
<br>that is included in President Bush's letter." With this, he 
<br>insisted the United States continue to support Yemen, both 
<br>financially and politically, and "stand in the way of those 
<br>against us." Saleh presented Townsend with a letter for 
<br>President Bush and a report on Yemen's efforts to combat 
<br>terrorism. 
<br>
<br>Comment 
<br>- - - - - 
<br>
<br>19.(S) Overall, this meeting was more constructive than some 
<br>observers would have expected. Given Saleh's colorful 
<br>character and knack for theatrics, the inclusion of a weapons 
<br>trafficker during his lunch with Townsend was not a complete 
<br>surprise. Saleh's action was seen by some as a veiled threat 
<br>to Mana'a, but was clearly also a message to the USG that in 
<br>his country he will do as he pleases. Like other leaders in 
<br>the region, Saleh is loathe to be perceived as subservient to 
<br>US or Western interests. His use of the dual threats of 
<br>terrorism and instability when referring to internal conflict 
<br>is also not new. Saleh consistently uses this tactic when 
<br>attempting to garner USG support. Saleh's allowing USG 
<br>interrogation of al-Badawi is positive. The fact that Saleh 
<br>released this convicted terrorist, despite USG objections, 
<br>however, is cause for concern. Saleh's acceptance of 
<br>Townsend's proposal of assistance in drafting the CT and cash 
<br>courier law and his commitment to joint action to combat 
<br>terrorism outside Yemen are welcome developments, as is his 
<br>willingness to cooperate to stem the flow of Yemeni fighters 
<br>to Iraq, even if his acceptance of these ideas is nonchalant. 
<br>Post will continue to work with the ROYG to ensure these 
<br>commitments are not forgotten. 
<br>
<br>20.(U) Minimize considered for Baghdad.
