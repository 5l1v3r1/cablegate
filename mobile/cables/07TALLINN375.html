<br>¶1. (S) Summary. On April 27, Estonia became the 
<br>unprecedented victim of the world's first cyber attacks 
<br>against a nation state. Although an analysis of events is 
<br>ongoing, this event demonstrated the vulnerability of both 
<br>government and private sector internet infrastructure. 
<br>Working together with Estonian cyber security experts, the 
<br>Ministry of Defense (MOD) is preparing a report analyzing 
<br>the crisis, evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the 
<br>Estonian response, and recommend changes to Estonia's cyber 
<br>defenses and security. The GOE and Estonian cyber defense 
<br>experts all agree that while they successfully responded to 
<br>these attacks, they will need to improve Estonia's defenses 
<br>to prevent what they described as the nightmare scenario: a 
<br>shutdown of Estonia's internet infrastructure as a result 
<br>of more serious attacks at some point in the future. End 
<br>Summary. 
<br>
<br>
<br>The Nature of the Attacks 
<br>------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) Starting on April 27, Estonia became the world's 
<br>first victim of cyber attacks against a nation state's 
<br>political and economic infrastructure. For over a month, 
<br>government, banking, media, and other Estonian websites, 
<br>servers, and routers came under a barrage of ever-shifting 
<br>and coordinated cyber attacks that tried to shut down 
<br>specific strategic targets (Ref A). Unlike traditional 
<br>cyber attacks which try to "hack" into a system, the 
<br>attacks against Estonian sites used the basic architecture 
<br>of the internet to disrupt their operation. At Post's 
<br>request XXXXXXXXXXXX visited Tallinn to assess the
<br>situationApril 16-18.  XXXXXXXXXXXX opined that it is
<br>not technically feasible to  prevent attacks of this nature,
<br>no matter how sophisticated  a country's cyber-defenses are.
<br>However, due to Estonia's  rapid response, the attacks did
<br>not seriously threaten  Estonia's cyber network and infrastructure. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) The cyber attacks exposed the strengths and 
<br>weaknesses of Estonia's cyber defense system. XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br> told us that the Ministry of Defense is  preparing a report to
<br>submit to the GOE by the end of June.  Based on our discussions
<br>with GOE, CERT, and private  Estonian cyber security experts,
<br>it is clear that the Estonians are working furiously to analyze
<br>where their cyber defenses and protocols worked, failed, and/or
<br>need  improvement. Although these cyber attacks were 
<br>unprecedented in nature, our Estonian interlocutors all 
<br>agreed that the outcome could have been much worse. They 
<br>also note that the MOD's report notwithstanding, the impact 
<br>on cyber defense policy for both the public and private 
<br>sectors will be discussed and felt for a very long time. 
<br>The following is a summary of GOE "lessons learned" from 
<br>these attacks. 
<br>
<br>Lessons Learned: What Worked 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) STRENGTH IN BEING SMALL. With a population of 1.3 
<br>million people, Estonia's small size was its strongest 
<br>asset in reacting rapidly to the cyber attacks. Estonia's 
<br>CERT, the GOE's Cyber Defense Unit, and private IT Security 
<br>Managers all knew each other for years before the crisis 
<br>and were, thus, able to work closely together. Information 
<br>sharing and decision making were rapid and flexible. 
<br>Everything was handled - from the working level to the 
<br>leadership - in an almost seamless fashion throughout the 
<br>attacks. "We're talking about a group of ten key people in 
<br>the government and private sector who've known each other 
<br>for years, trust one another, and all have direct access to 
<br>
<br>TALLINN 00000375 002 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>each other" XXXXXXXXXXXX,  commented to us.
<br>"Therefore, there was no inter-agency  bureaucracy or
<br>red tape to cut through." 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) E-VOTING. In March 2007, Estonia held the world's 
<br>first national election where e-voting was used. From the 
<br>outset of the crisis, the e-voting security team was 
<br>immediately seconded to CERT and became a vital asset in 
<br>responding to the attacks. Although Estonia's CERT has 
<br>only two full time staff, XXXXXXXXXXXX said he was able
<br>to call  upon a roster of 200 programmers and security
<br>experts from  the e-voting security team to ensure a 24/7 response 
<br>mechanism against incoming cyber attacks. As the e-voting 
<br>team was already at work on next generation security 
<br>measures (in anticipation for Estonia's 2009 local 
<br>elections), there was no need for them to "catch up" 
<br>according to XXXXXXXXXXXX. These experts were invaluable
<br>in  addressing the wide variety of attacks (e.g., bots, spam, 
<br>DDoS, Trojan Horses, etc.). 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) INFORMATION GATHERING. Our MOD interlocutors credit 
<br>Estonian law enforcement and cyber security experts' 
<br>(public and private) close monitoring of Russian-language 
<br>internet forums as key to CERT's ability to rapidly respond 
<br>to the attacks. On April 28, less than 24 hours after the 
<br>first cyber attacks, Russian-language internet forums 
<br>(e.g., http://2ch.ru and http://forum.xaker.ru) were 
<br>exhorting people to attack specific GOE websites and 
<br>offering links to software tools. Patient monitoring of 
<br>these internet-forums led to intelligence on targets, 
<br>dates, and exact times for coordinated attacks.
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX told us  privately that without this
<br> information, the cyber attacks  against GOE sites could hav
<br> inflicted far more damage than  they did. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) SECURE ONLINE BANKING. Hansabank and SEB 
<br>successfully weathered the cyber attacks against them 
<br>because of defensive measures and procedures already in 
<br>place. According to CERT, the banks' procedures are in 
<br>many ways superior to the GOE's. XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br> said that due to  the longstanding problem of cyber crime
<br>in the region -  often with banks as prime targets - the banks
<br>were well  prepared for the attacks. For example,
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX  told us,  organized gangs have
<br>employed bot attacks in the past. As  a result, Hansabank
<br> had the necessary cyber security  measures in place to defend 
<br>against this type of attack. 
<br>In the end, Hansabank-s sites successfully repelled every 
<br>attack and were able to provide their Estonian customers 
<br>access to their online accounts. (Note. Almost 90% of all 
<br>financial transactions (e.g., bill payments) are done 
<br>online. Hansabank and SEB alone handle over three-fourths 
<br>of that traffic. End Note.) 
<br>
<br>Lessons Learned: What Failed 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (S) FORMAL PROCEDURES. XXXXXXXXXXXX told us
<br>he  believes that Estonia-s formal and institutional procedures 
<br>for responding to cyber attacks failed completely. 
<br>Throughout the crisis, ad hoc meetings and decision making 
<br>based on established informal contacts and relationships 
<br>were used to disseminate information - instead of 
<br>formalized institutional channels with clear communication 
<br>chains. Additionally, XXXXXXXXXXXX told us that the GOE
<br>did  not keep an official record or log of decisions and actions 
<br>taken during the crisis. Consequently, it is uncertain how 
<br>thorough the GOE's post-crisis assessment or efforts to 
<br>improve Estonia's formal cyber defense procedures will be. 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX explained that neither CERT nor the GOE
<br>had the  personnel to "put out the fire and also act as a secretary 
<br>to take down the minutes." (Note: XXXXXXXXXXXX claims
<br>of  staff shortages are somewhat questionable given that he 
<br>told us that neither he nor any of his staff had to work 
<br>over-time during the cyber attacks. End Note.) 
<br>
<br>¶9. (S) LACK OF CENTRALIZED GOE POLICY. MOD interlocutors 
<br>admitted that there was no consistent GOE policy across 
<br>
<br>TALLINN 00000375 003 OF 004 
<br>
<br>ministries on cyber security, broadband capacity, and 
<br>information sharing. For example, some ministries use 
<br>static websites while others use more vulnerable dynamic 
<br>websites. Ministries also use different internet providers 
<br>which have different security procedures in place. This 
<br>unnecessary complexity made initial information sharing 
<br>between ministries more cumbersome and confusing, 
<br>especially for ministries with fewer resources for IT risk 
<br>management (e.g., the Ministry of Population, Ministry of 
<br>Education, Ministry of Culture, etc.). XXXXXXXXXXXX,
<br>told us that creating a  consistent policy for the various ministries 
<br>will be a key  recommendation in the MOD's report. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (S) MONITORING. The cyber attacks also exposed 
<br>Estonia's total lack of a comprehensive monitoring system. 
<br>Estonia does not have a national IP (internet protocol) 
<br>network of sensors to precisely monitor traffic for cyber 
<br>attacks. As a result, the GOE and CERT did not have any 
<br>hard data on the number of computers and/or servers that 
<br>were used in the attacks. XXXXXXXXXXXX, Estonia's main telecommunication and IT  provider, told us that his company
<br>relies on U.S.-based  Arbor Networks to monitor its network.
<br>Our MOD and private sector interlocutors all agreed on how
<br>important it was for  Estonia to have its own monitoring network,
<br>but they could  not confirm on the likelihood that the GOE
<br>would invest in  this infrastructure upgrade. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (S) WHACK-A-MOLE. In the initial stages of the cyber 
<br>attacks, the Estonian method of response was to block each 
<br>and every attack through its corresponding ISP address as 
<br>it happened. XXXXXXXXXXXX dubbed this the "whack-a- 
<br>mole" response and opined that prior to April 27 this 
<br>approach might have been sufficient. However, the sheer 
<br>volume of the recent cyber attacks quickly overwhelmed the 
<br>Estonian defenses. CERT, Elion, and the GOE's Cyber Defense 
<br>Unit were eventually forced to apply broader and more 
<br>stringent filtering mechanisms on all internet traffic to 
<br>prevent the attacks from entering Estonia. XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>observed that unlike the United States and many European 
<br>Union members who routinely filter foreign internet 
<br>traffic, prior to the recent attacks, the Estonian network 
<br>filtered very little foreign traffic. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (S) INDUSTRY VULNERABILITY. While Hansabank and SEB 
<br>successfully weathered the cyber attacks, many other 
<br>smaller private Estonian sites that were attacked were 
<br>overwhelmed. With no industry standard or best practice in 
<br>place in Estonia, many smaller businesses and/or private 
<br>organizations (e.g., schools, NGOs, etc.) did not have the 
<br>technical expertise or financial means to ramp up their 
<br>broadband capacity. XXXXXXXXXXXX claimed that CERT's
<br>log of  complaints and reported cyber attacks since April 27 is 
<br>over 10 Tb (Tera bits). (Note. One TB is equal to one 
<br>million Mega bits. To put this in perspective, the entire 
<br>content of the online U.S. Library of Congress uses less 
<br>than 10 TB. End Note.) As the majority of Estonian (SME) 
<br>small and medium size enterprises employ online services as 
<br>part of their daily business, the GOE is now aware that an 
<br>industry standard with readily available cyber defensive 
<br>software, tools, training, and public awareness-raising 
<br>must become a part of Estonia's cyber defenses. 
<br>
<br>Lessons Learned: Nightmare Scenarios 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶13. (S) TARGETING KEY ROUTERS AND SITES. Our Estonian 
<br>interlocutors all agreed that even during the attacks' 
<br>peak, Estonia's cyber network was not in any serious danger 
<br>of being shut down. In some ways, Estonia was lucky. Rein 
<br>Ottis, MOD Cyber Defense Chief, noted that had the attacks 
<br>specifically targeted Estonia's key servers and routers, 
<br>they could have shut down Estonia's entire cyber 
<br>infrastructure. On May 4, two routers belonging to the GOE 
<br>and Elion were attacked with an unknown data packet that 
<br>crashed the routers almost immediately. XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>told us that if enough key  routers and/or servers were shut down, 
<br>it would be the internet "equivalent of blowing up key roads and
<br>
<br>TALLINN 00000375 004 OF 004 
<br>
<br>intersections in the city Tallinn to bring all traffic to a  halt." 
<br>
<br>¶14. (S) UNANNOUNCED AND BETTER TIMED ATTACKS. Most of the 
<br>cyber attacks were discussed in advance on Russian-language 
<br>internet forums, giving the Estonians the opportunity to 
<br>ramp up broadband capacity in advance. XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br> told us that  the perpetrators gave away the element of surprise 
<br>and  often timed their attacks in the evening (when Estonia's 
<br>internet usage is at its lowest). Had they not made these 
<br>mistakes, XXXXXXXXXXXX opined that the attacks could
<br> have shut  down their GOE targets for up to a week.
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX  was  thankful that they had advance
<br>information about th  May 15  attacks against Hansabank and 
<br>SEB. However, many  of the  attacks which employed bots
<br>were unannounced and far more challenging, and in some
<br>cases did crash their targets. If  all attacks had been like this,
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXX could  not
<br>confidently predict whether Estonia's defenses would 
<br>have held. 
<br>
<br>¶15. (S) 2ND TIER STRATEGIC ATTACKS. Estonia's banks were 
<br>generally well prepared for cyber attacks. However, the 
<br>economic impact could have been worse if the attacks had 
<br>focused on 2nd tier strategic targets which possessed less 
<br>formidable defenses (Ref B). XXXXXXXXXXXX speculated
<br>the  fallout would have been far more significant if Estonia's 
<br>logistic-transport companies had been attacked. "As over 
<br>three-fourths of all grocery stores, petrol stations, and 
<br>shops rely on the internet for their orders and 
<br>deliveries," asked XXXXXXXXXXXX, "can you imagine the
<br>damage  this would bring? Cyber crime seems abstract to most 
<br>people. There's nothing abstract about empty shelves in 
<br>stores." XXXXXXXXXXXX also listed a whole range of
<br>other strategic services and businesses that would have been far 
<br>easier to crash than the banks. The MOD felt that 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX descriptions were far fetched, bordering
<br>on  "science fiction." However, when we mentioned
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX's  comments to XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br> he felt that recent events have changed  the parameters
<br>of the debate on possible threat scenarios.  He said, 
<br>"Last year, I would've considered a cyber war  against my
<br> country as science fiction, too - but not  anymore."
