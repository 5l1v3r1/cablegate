<br>
<br>Classified By: DCM GREG DELAWIE. REASONS: 1.4 (B) AND (D).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: The Chancellery is confident that Chancellor
<br>Merkel's policy statement to the Bundestag on September 8 has
<br>succeeded -- at least for now -- in settling the domestic
<br>political controversy surrounding the September 4 air strikes
<br>against two hijacked fuel tankers in Kunduz. Ironically, the
<br>Greens called for the special parliamentary session in a
<br>clear attempt to embarrass the government and to make a
<br>campaign issue out of the controversy, but Merkel used it to
<br>her advantage to elicit support for the German deployment in
<br>Afghanistan by all the major parties, save for the Left
<br>Party, which has always opposed the mission. While it had
<br>been expected that internal critics would seize on the
<br>bombing to score political points against the Chancellor and
<br>Defense Minister Jung, the Chancellery, MFA and MOD all
<br>expressed dismay that their closest Allies -- especially the
<br>French -- had made a rush to judgment. Officials at both the
<br>MFA and MOD also expressed disappointment that despite
<br>Germany's excellent track record in avoiding civilian
<br>casualties, COMISAF GEN McChrystal, in their view, quickly
<br>assumed the worst about German actions in this case. The MOD
<br>emphasized that while everything was calm now, this issue
<br>would need to be carefully managed in the coming weeks to
<br>prevent it from becoming a source of anti-Americanism. Both
<br>MFA and Chancellery officials emphasized that the joint
<br>German-UK-France proposal for an international conference on
<br>Afghanistan was not made in reaction to the Kunduz event and
<br>is not a cover for trying to secure a date certain for
<br>withdrawal. END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>Chancellor's statement
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) In her policy statement to the Bundestag on September
<br>8, Chancellor Merkel appealed to ISAF allies as well as
<br>critics at home to reserve judgment regarding the September 4
<br>decision by the German PRT commander in Kunduz to call in air
<br>strikes against two fuel tankers that had been hijacked by
<br>insurgents. At the same time, she promised a full inquiry
<br>into the matter and gave assurances that Germany took the
<br>issue of collateral damage very seriously. "Even the death
<br>of one innocent person is one too many," she stressed. In
<br>retreating from the initial stand taken by Defense Minister
<br>Jung -- who had insisted that only insurgents had been killed
<br>in the nighttime attack -- she succeeded in deflating some of
<br>the early indignation over the incident, since Jung's
<br>statements seemed to defy clear evidence to the contrary.
<br>All the major parties, with the exception of the Left Party,
<br>which opposes all Bundeswehr deployments, used the special
<br>Bundestag session to reaffirm their support for the
<br>Afghanistan mission and to reject calls for withdrawal.

<br>
<br>¶8. (C) With only three weeks before German national
<br>elections, it goes without saying that the Kunduz incident
<br>comes at a very politically sensitive time. Fortunately, the
<br>Chancellor, in her policy statement to the Bundestag, has
<br>been able to limit the damage to the delicate political
<br>
<br>Berlin 00001108 003 of 003
<br>
<br>
<br>consensus here in favor of the Afghanistan deployment. She
<br>has successfully rallied all the main political parties in
<br>rejecting calls for withdrawal. The hope is that the Allies
<br>and others will refrain from any further premature judgments
<br>or speculation about what happened in Kunduz, which could be
<br>exploited by the Left Party and other Afghanistan opponents
<br>for electoral advantage.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) The Kunduz incident ironically also comes at a time
<br>when the views of the United States and Germany regarding the
<br>approach to Afghanistan have never been closer. All of our
<br>interlocutors warmly welcome COMISAF's new counterinsurgency
<br>guidance, which emphasizes protecting the Afghan population
<br>over chasing down and killing insurgents. They view the new
<br>U.S. emphasis on avoiding civilian casualties as moving
<br>toward a position they have long advocated. At the same
<br>time, they now acknowledge that their own forces, in view of
<br>the deteriorating security situation in the north, have to be
<br>more active in providing security and being willing to use
<br>force as appropriate. Their new rules of engagement (ref A)
<br>have gone a long way in this regard. Along similar lines,
<br>the old debate between the U.S. and Germany on the best way
<br>to train Afghan police -- i.e., the U.S. supposedly stressing
<br>speed and quantity versus the Germans stressing quality -- is
<br>over. The Germans have completely signed up to the U.S.
<br>focused district development (FDD) police training program
<br>and are moving toward to taking responsibility for FDD
<br>throughout the north (ref B).
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) It is this convergence of views, and their belief
<br>that they are one of our most reliable Allies in Afghanistan,
<br>that makes the Germans so sensitive to any perceived U.S.
<br>criticism of their actions. They feel that their careful and
<br>dependable management of the north -- while acknowledging the
<br>growing problems with the insurgency there -- have earned
<br>them the benefit of the doubt when incidents like the fuel
<br>tanker bombing in Kunduz occur. As we go forward with our
<br>plans to deploy some 300 U.S. Special Forces in Mazar-e
<br>Sharif to assist the Germans in meeting the growing
<br>insurgency threat, we will want to be careful not to give the
<br>impression that we do not have faith in the Germans to do
<br>what is necessary to continue to secure the north as they
<br>have been for almost six years. While the Germans have been
<br>consistently reluctant about deploying combat troops outside
<br>the north, they have been equally consistent in ensuring that
<br>all the troop and equipment needs in the north -- including
<br>OMLTs for the training of the Afghan National Army (ANA) --
<br>are fulfilled. It is our interest for the Germans to
<br>continue to feel "ownership" of this part of the country.
