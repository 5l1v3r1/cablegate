<br> 
<br>SUMMARY 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (C) Chancellor Merkel achieved her goal of a solid 
<br>parliamentary majority for her Christian Democratic Union 
<br>(CDU) with its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social 
<br>Union (CSU), and the pro-business Free Democratic Party 
<br>(FDP), but will have to contend with a self-confident FDP 
<br>that is likely to seek major concessions in terms of policy 
<br>and personnel.  Nonetheless, the CDU/CSU's 33.8 percent 
<br>showing was its lowest since 1949, while the FDP's 14.6 
<br>percent was its strongest in the history of the Federal 
<br>Republic.  The SPD crashed, while the Left Party and Greens 
<br>were able to score their highest results ever, with the Left 
<br>Party surpassing the Greens overall and overtaking the SPD in 
<br>the eastern German states by a wide margin.  Merkel hopes 
<br>that coalition negotiations with the FDP will be "quick and 
<br>decisive," while FDP Chairman Guido Westerwelle -- widely 
<br>expected to be the next foreign minister -- has emphasized 
<br>his intention to press for the party's goals of a fundamental 
<br>tax reform, more emphasis on education, and stronger 
<br>protection of civil liberties.   Merkel and Westerwelle 
<br>already met privately election night (September 27) and 
<br>coalition negotiations should begin soon, most likely with 
<br>the goal of having a formal agreement with the selection of a 
<br>cabinet by the time the Bundestag convenes a month from now. 
<br>End Summary. 
<br> 
<br>OVERALL TREND: MAJOR PARTIES IN DECLINE 
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (U) The results show the decline of the major parties -- 
<br>particularly the SPD -- and the strengthening of a five-party 
<br>system.  Preliminary results give CDU/CSU 33.8 percent 
<br>(versus 35.2 percent in 2005); the FDP 14.6 percent (9.8); 
<br>the SPD 23.0 (34.3); the Left Party 11.9 (8.7), and the 
<br>Greens 10.7 (8.1).  The decline in the CDU/CSU percentage is 
<br>due particularly to the CSU's losses in Bavaria, where the 
<br>party suffered its worst Bundestag result ever at 42.6 
<br>percent, down from 49.2 percent in 2005, but it still won all 
<br>45 of its constituencies.  These preliminary results give the 
<br>CDU 24 "surplus mandates" because of the high number of 
<br>constituency seats it won despite its low 33.8 percent second 
<br>vote showing (see REFTEL G). 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (U) The new coalition should end up with control of both 
<br>the Bundestag and the Bundesrat (Upper Council).  Based on 
<br>the preliminary official results, the CDU/CSU will have 239 
<br>seats in the Bundestag (up from 226), which along with the 93 
<br>FDP Bundestag seats (previously 61) would give the new 
<br>government a solid majority.  The SPD will have 146 seats in 
<br>the Bundestag (down from 222), the Left Party 76 (versus 54) 
<br>and the Greens 68 (versus 51).  The Schleswig Holstein 
<br>election on September 27 also appears to have given the CDU 
<br>and FDP a parliamentary majority in that state.  With CDU-FDP 
<br>governments there and in Saxony, where the two parties won a 
<br>majority on August 30, the new CDU/CSU-FDP coalition will 
<br>soon have a majority in the Bundesrat and should be able to 
<br>gain its approval of future coalition legislation. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (C) Chancellor Merkel and her CDU/CSU Union are somewhat 
<br>disappointed by their party's results, but are publicly 
<br>emphasizing that the CDU/CSU-SPD Grand Coalition has met its 
<br>demise and will be replaced by a center-right coalition 
<br>composed of the CDU/CSU and FDP.  "We achieved something 
<br>fantastic," said Chancellor Merkel, now facing a second 
<br>four-year term.  "We achieved a stable majority in Germany 
<br>for a new government...We can party tonight, but there is a 
<br>lot of work waiting for us."  An uncharacteristically 
<br>emotional Merkel -- clearly relieved by her victory -- 
<br>promised to be the "Chancellor of all Germans" -- old and 
<br>young, entrepreneurs and workers -- and said the CDU/CSU 
<br>would be sufficiently dominant in the new coalition to 
<br>prevail "in questions that affect social balance." 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (C) Despite her huge personal popularity, however, Merkel 
<br>led her CDU/CSU Union to its second poorest result in 
<br>history, leaving her vulnerable to future backstabbing within 
<br> 
<br>BERLIN 00001197  002 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>her party.  Merkel -- while happy to be rid of the Grand 
<br>Coalition with the SPD -- now faces the challenging task of 
<br>entering a coalition with a party that could prove to be more 
<br>difficult to manage than the SPD.  Merkel will start talks 
<br>with the FDP within days.  It could, however, take up to the 
<br>end of October for the parties to forge the policy 
<br>compromises and work out the distribution of cabinet posts 
<br>necessary to seal a coalition deal. 
<br> 
<br>FDP: THE REAL WINNER 
<br>-------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (C) The FDP will return to government after eleven years 
<br>in opposition, having achieved its best election results in 
<br>the party's history.  Its leader, FDP Party Chairman Guido 
<br>Westerwelle, will most likely become Germany's next foreign 
<br>minister (see REFTEL E).  At the FDP election celebration, 
<br>Westerwelle told his party faithful that "We want to be part 
<br>of the government.  But this means responsibility, and we are 
<br>ready to take on this responsibility." Westerwelle said his 
<br>party would work to ensure that Germany gets a "fair tax 
<br>system and better educational opportunities" and that civil 
<br>rights would once again be respected. The FDP will be in a 
<br>very powerful position to demand a larger number of cabinet 
<br>seats in a new German government. They are likely to expect 
<br>to get at least the equivalent of what they have had in the 
<br>past:  the foreign office, either justice or perhaps interior 
<br>(which they led from 1969-82), economics or possibly finance, 
<br>and at least one other ministry (in the past they have had 
<br>education and economic cooperation (i.e. development). 
<br>However, the FDP will find it difficult to negotiate a 
<br>coalition agreement with the CDU/CSU over the coming weeks, 
<br>especially in the areas of tax cuts (see REFTEL F) and civil 
<br>rights, including data privacy (see REFTEL D). 
<br> 
<br>SPD: HARD ROAD AHEAD 
<br>-------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (C) It would be hard to exaggerate the dimension of the 
<br>SPD defeat.  The party fell more than 11 points to its worst 
<br>result in the post-war period.  Its share of the eastern 
<br>German vote was 19 percent, behind both the CDU and Left 
<br>Party, and the FDP came within striking distance of the SPD 
<br>in some western German states, including Bavaria, where the 
<br>SPD's 17 percent was just ahead of the FDP's 15 percent.  The 
<br>SPD election-night party was like a funeral, and Steinmeier 
<br>and SPD party chairman Muentefering appeared grim-faced to 
<br>announce that Steinmeier would be the Bundestag caucus 
<br>chairman and thus unofficial leader of the opposition to the 
<br>new black-yellow government.  Muentefering did not, as many 
<br>expected, announce his resignation but it is likely to come 
<br>by the time of the next party conference in mid-November. 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (C) Exit polls show that the SPD lost more than a million 
<br>votes to former supporters who simply stayed home and 
<br>additional voters to the Left Party and Greens, and that the 
<br>public still blames it for the changes in unemployment 
<br>insurance and the retirement age enacted during the Schroeder 
<br>government and as part of the grand coalition.  The SPD, with 
<br>only four minister-presidents and a shrunken parliamentary 
<br>caucus, will have to decide how to profile itself against its 
<br>two fellow leftist opposition parties, and the party left is 
<br>likely to press for coalitions with the Left and Greens at 
<br>the state level. 
<br> 
<br>LEFT OVERTAKES GREENS 
<br>--------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (C) The Left Party -- under Oskar Lafontaine's and Gregor 
<br>Gysi's leadership -- can also claim electoral victory with 
<br>their party's best showing ever in a parliamentary election. 
<br>Having won 11.9 per cent of the total vote and 20 direct 
<br>mandates -- the largest number ever for one of the smaller 
<br>parties -- it will be difficult for Germany's other parties, 
<br>especially the SPD, to ignore The Left's steady rise in 
<br>popularity in east and west Germany (see REFTEL B).  The 
<br>party successfully stole the SPD's thunder and was partially 
<br>responsible for the SPD's poorest showing ever in German 
<br>election history.  The Left Party can now concentrate on 
<br>achieving the ultimate prize in German politics in 2013: a 
<br>governing coalition with the SPD and the Greens.  Berlin SPD 
<br>Governing Mayor Klaus Wowereit has already said that this 
<br>year's election must be the last one in which the SPD 
<br>excludes the possibility of cooperation with the Left, and he 
<br>and other left-wingers in the SPD will likely fight to bring 
<br>the two parties closer together. 
<br> 
<br>GREENS: HOW TO STAY RELEVANT? 
<br> 
<br>BERLIN 00001197  003 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (C) The Greens may have celebrated their first double 
<br>digit showing (10.7 per cent) in a parliamentary election, 
<br>but the party was unsuccessful in preventing a black-yellow 
<br>coalition or becoming the third strongest party in the 
<br>Bundestag (see REFTEL A).  Party Co-Chairman Cem Oezdemir -- 
<br>who failed to win his direct mandate and was too low on the 
<br>party list to win a seat in the Bundestag -- said that the 
<br>Greens would establish themselves as a "think tank for social 
<br>issues and for Germany as a whole."  The SPD's disastrous 
<br>electoral result will remind the Greens that they may need to 
<br>reach out to the CDU if they are to remain a relevant 
<br>political power.  For the foreseeable future, Oezdemir hinted 
<br>that his party would concentrate on achieving good results at 
<br>future state elections and plotting their return to power in 
<br>¶2013. 
<br> 
<br>COMMENT 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶11.  (C) Chancellor Merkel's main campaign objective -- to 
<br>attract centrist support by out-positioning the SPD as the 
<br>best protector of Germany's social welfare state -- was 
<br>successful, although her CDU/CSU union suffered losses, 
<br>primarily because of the CSU.  She will now have to find a 
<br>way to balance this promise with FDP demands for greater 
<br>reforms while dealing with the likely struggles between a 
<br>strengthened FDP and a CSU that is concerned about its 
<br>continued decline.  The parties will now enter complex 
<br>coalition negotiations with pressure to complete them by the 
<br>time that the new Bundestag convenes in late October, these 
<br>talks have the potential to be very contentious.  Merkel will 
<br>want to stamp her authority on the coalition agreement, while 
<br>Westerwelle will be a tough bargaining partner for Merkel as 
<br>he aims to extract the maximum amount of policy and personnel 
<br>concessions from the CDU/CSU.  Finally, as a weakened SPD 
<br>moves into the opposition, it can be expected that it will 
<br>seek to continue the public debate on the major campaign 
<br>issues and begin to rebuild itself, a process that could 
<br>include its strong re-positioning to the left. 
<br> 
<br>¶12.  (C)  What does a CDU/CSU-FDP victory mean for the United 
<br>States?  On a practical level, Germany will have a new 
<br>foreign minister, most likely Guido Westerwelle, who has 
<br>enjoyed a difficult relationship with the United States 
<br>during his time spent in opposition (see REFTEL D). 
<br>Westerwelle will face a steep learning curve at the MFA, but 
<br>we should not expect him to play second fiddle to Chancellor 
<br>Merkel.  The foreign and security policy rivalry between the 
<br>MFA and Chancellery during the Bush Administration will not 
<br>disappear.  Indeed, they may be enhanced with Westerwelle's 
<br>attempt to profile and make an international name for himself 
<br>as quickly as possible, making it difficult for us to 
<br>identify who is in the lead on any given issue.  Chancellor 
<br>Merkel and Westerwelle will be competing for attention; the 
<br>latter's flamboyant and outgoing style may give him a leg up 
<br>but Chancellor Merkel will be keen to assert her primacy in 
<br>international affairs, especially on economic and EU matters. 
<br> She has more government and foreign policy experience that 
<br>will come in handy in this future duel, and in an age of 
<br>international summitry, the Chancellor rather than the 
<br>Foreign Minister calls the shots.  We should not 
<br>underestimate her desire to carve out a political legacy for 
<br>herself, especially in the international arena, and her 
<br>record of strong cooperation with Washington suggests that 
<br>her dominance is likely to have a net benefit for US 
<br>interests.
