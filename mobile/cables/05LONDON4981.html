<br>Summary
<br>--------
<br>¶1. (C) On June 10, Efthimios Mitropoulos, Secretary General
<br>of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) briefed
<br>ESTOff on his trip the previous week to the Korean Peninsula.
<br>Even before his arrival, the North had indicated that his
<br>offer of the IMO's good offices to increase North-South
<br>maritime cooperation was appreciated, but that the "time was
<br>not right." Instead, much of what he heard in the North
<br>involved current perspectives on the 6-party talks and North
<br>Korea's relationship with the U.S. Mitropoulos said he had
<br>met with the North Korean Ambassador in London earlier in the
<br>day, and gave EstOff his confidential notes from that meeting
<br>(see para 6). End Summary.
<br>
<br>In seoul - messages for the north
<br>---------------------------------
<br>¶2. (C) On June 10, Efthimios Mitropoulos, Secretary General
<br>of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) briefed
<br>ESTOff on his trip the previous week to the Korean Peninsula.
<br>Mitropoulos spent little time describing his itinerary in
<br>South Korea, only to say that in meetings with the President
<br>and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, he was asked to
<br>encourage the North to increased cooperation in maritime
<br>affairs and to express the South's concern for the treatment
<br>of North Korean ships calling at Japanese ports. In addition,
<br>the Vice Minister for the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and
<br>Fisheries asked Mitropoulos to convey a message of friendship
<br>to the North and suggesting joint fishery activities or
<br>projects in the context of the bilateral maritime agreement.
<br>Mitropoulos noted, however, that even prior to his departure
<br>from London, the North Korean Ambassador in London had
<br>conveyed IMO's offer to Pyongyang. Pyongyang responded that
<br>it appreciated IMO's offer, but in the context of the
<br>Sunshine policy, "the time was not right" to pursue the IMO's
<br>proposed areas of cooperation. (Per reftel, Mitropoulos
<br>proposed that the IMO assist in the following areas: 1)
<br>cooperation on search and rescue, 2) joint responsibilities
<br>for responding to major pollution incidents, 3) technical
<br>cooperation including training of maritime personnel, and 4)
<br>cooperation on maritime traffic between the two countries.)
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) The ROK Minister of Foreign Affairs also thanked IMO
<br>for offering its good offices to increase cooperation with
<br>the North. He then asked Mitropoulos to tell the North that
<br>"the message from the South is to come back to the six-party
<br>talks." Once the North participates, he said, and the
<br>nuclear program is dismantled and verified by the
<br>International Energy Administration (IEA), food, energy, and
<br>security will be guaranteed and we will activate the maritime
<br>agreement. The Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs added that
<br>were these conditions met, "funds would be made available to
<br>effect these programs." The Vice Foreign Minister added that
<br>the South feels it is under pressure from the U.S. He said,
<br>the U.S. is trying to stop the ROK from doing anything until
<br>the North agrees to return to the talks. The ROK President,
<br>he said, will find himself in a difficult position during his
<br>meeting with President Bush in Washington. For this reason,
<br>it would be nice if Mitropoulos could tell the North that the
<br>ROK would appreciate the North sending a positive signal that
<br>the President of ROK could take with him on his visit to
<br>Washington.
<br>
<br>In pyongyang - messages for the u.s.
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>¶4. (C) Flying to the North via Beijing, Mitropoulos met wit
<br>the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs and the "President of
<br>the Presidium" who told him that attempts to improve
<br>relations with the South had been repeatedly frustrated by
<br>"outside forces" (i.e., the U.S.). He said the North's
<br>attempts to pursue a policy of "consultation, cooperation,
<br>and reconciliation" had been frustrated by the U.S. and its
<br>stand on nuclear issues. As an example, he asserted that the
<br>South had pledged to send the North 500K tons of fertilizer,
<br>but ended up only sending 200K tons due the U.S.
<br>intervention. The North, he said, wants to phase out its
<br>nuclear program, but through dialogue, since the U.S. is
<br>directly threatening the North with nuclear weapons. xxxxx
<br>The U.S. should show sincerity, he said, by entering
<br>into bilateral talks with the North. Vice President Cheney's
<br>remarks were slanderous, he added, and make it clear and the
<br>U.S. has no interest in resolving the talks peacefully. "If
<br>you meet our American friends, he said, "please pass this
<br>message to them - that the U.S. should come with sincerity
<br>and honest minds to resolve this issue." He stated, the
<br>current U.S. proposal that we dismantle or nuclear program,
<br>after which they will give assurances is not fair - the two
<br>gestures should occur simultaneously "in trust." Mitropoulos
<br>countered that he understood the U.S. position somewhat
<br>differently. Further, he said that if the North does not
<br>trust the U.S., it seemed to him that it would be better off
<br>working within the six party framework, rather than in a
<br>bilateral discussion. That way if any party did not live up
<br>to its end of the bargain, all of the North's neighbors would
<br>be at the table, not just the U.S.
<br>
<br>Impressions
<br>-----------
<br>¶5. (C) Mitropoulos said he had few expectations for the
<br>North, but was surprised further by what he found, beginning
<br>with the flight from Beijing on a dilapidated Russia-made
<br>passenger jet. He the flight was about 80% full, with over
<br>half the passengers Iranian. He noted, "How do they expect
<br>the West to believe their nuclear program is not a threat
<br>when flights to the country are full of Iranians?" He was
<br>housed in a huge eight bedroom guesthouse with no other
<br>guests, and enjoyed a modern TV which included 114 channel,
<br>only one of which worked - the government's channel. When he
<br>got off the plane, he was greeted by a party including
<br>officials bearing flowers that he "might want to dedicate" to
<br>the Great Leader. Feeling he had no choice without creating
<br>an incident upon arrival, Mitropoulos laid a wreath at a
<br>statue of Kim Il Sung while TV cameras whirred. He was then
<br>asked if he had brought any gifts for the Great Leader, even
<br>though his staff had made it clear that he would not be
<br>bringing gifts on the trip. When he visited port facilities,
<br>he felt that there had been no special preparation for his
<br>visit, and the Port Security Manager was unavailable to
<br>escort him on the tour of the Port's security system.
<br>
<br>¶6. (c) notes from the secgen's june 10 meeting with north
<br>korean ambassador in london (ri yong ho)
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----------------
<br>begin text:
<br>
<br>Memo for the file on the visit of the Ambassador of the
<br>Democratic Republic of Korea on 10 June 2005 (on SG's return
<br>from his mission to DPRK)
<br>
<br>(Covers the DPRK Ambassador's statement to SG's opening
<br>remarks)
<br>
<br>In his response, the Ambassador of DPRK said that they feel
<br>that bilateral talks with the Unites States would be better
<br>able to establish that the United States are serious and wish
<br>to reach an outcome. They are not bothered what format is
<br>used for the actual agreement - bilateral or six-party
<br>agreement - but bilateral talks are necessary to establish
<br>the seriousness of intention. Russia and China do not want
<br>to pin down what format is used. I noted any discussion is
<br>better than none, and that a note of point regarding the
<br>6-party agreement is it gives more guarantee.
<br>
<br>Confidence is not there for a bilateral agreement. The point
<br>is that DPRK does not believe the US is really prepared to
<br>seriously address the issue and reach a conclusion. The US
<br>is trying to buy time; and is not prepared to be flexible on
<br>the issue.
<br>
<br>Also he noted that there is pressure within the US
<br>Administration regarding Iraq and France. Therefore, The US
<br>are taking a tough stand on DPRK. Within the Administration
<br>itself they do not seem to be saying the same things.
<br>
<br>Later, when passing on the reaction of his capital to the
<br>SG's meetings with Government officials during his visit, the
<br>Ambassador of DPRK said that they were grateful that SG had
<br>shown interest in the affairs and willingness to help with
<br>problems in the peninsula exceeding his mandate as IMO SG.
<br>That was strongly appreciated. They were delighted to hear
<br>that the SG would bring about technical co-operation for
<br>better maritime development in DPRK; and emphasized that SG
<br>of IMO, an important agency of the UN system, has sympathetic
<br>ideas on the concerns of the Korean peninsula and its status
<br>as a nuclear-free region.
<br>
<br>The messages brought by the SG from RoK were duly noted and
<br>there is some discussion and initial reaction as far as
<br>co-operation between North and South is concerned. Some
<br>people in the DPRK Government are interested in co-operation
<br>with the South, in particular on maritime affairs although
<br>others believe these are not the most important ones, placing
<br>emphasis particularly on military issues. They hold the view
<br>that co-operation in the maritime field is good and they are
<br>willing to help whenever incidents involving RoK ships within
<br>their jurisdiction so require. But entering into a binding
<br>agreement with RoK on search and rescue (SAR) is a very
<br>serious issue as it means that the military will be bound to
<br>such an agreement and, because of the particular situation
<br>with PSI, the military is not prepared to be bound by legal
<br>agreements, so it will take some time for consideration.
<br>For other international conventions and treaties on maritime
<br>affairs, there are only technical problems not political, so
<br>it will only depend on preparations which they are willing to
<br>pursue.
<br>
<br>Re: the 6-party talks, there are some new developments since
<br>SG's visit. Their Government has indicated it is willing to
<br>go back to the table once there is something from the US side
<br>for face-saving, because they want the US to withdraw
<br>their insulting comments and particularly the statements
<br>about DPRK as an "outpost of tyranny" made by Secretary of
<br>State Condoleeza Rice. Once US indicate that these
<br>statements are withdrawn or that they will stop, the DPRK
<br>will return to the table for 6-party talks. They are open
<br>for any form of agreement. They have never been against the
<br>6-party talks. The 6-party talks are better at the end stage
<br>but at the initial stage bilateral talks are better for
<br>efficiency; or, possibly, the bilateral talks and 6-party
<br>talks could go hand-in-hand with the bilateral talks taking
<br>part continuously with updates to the 6 parties every 3
<br>months. Once no more insulting comments are forthcoming from
<br>the US, things can move ahead. He believes this position has
<br>been passed from Pyongyang to the RoK side - today or
<br>yesterday.
<br>
<br>He assured the SG that he would forward the SG's comments
<br>right away to Pyongyang. He also felt that using the sea as
<br>a bridge was a good idea, as the SG had suggested. So far,
<br>the sea has been a source of clashes for so many people.
<br>
<br>SG emphasized the importance of security in the peninsula and
<br>how crucial it was to ensure that nothing goes wrong causing
<br>the loss of innocent lives.
