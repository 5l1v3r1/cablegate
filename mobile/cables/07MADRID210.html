<br>SUBJECT: FM MORATINOS ON AFGHANISTAN
<br>
<br>REF: MADRID 208
<br>
<br>Classified By: Amb. Eduardo Aguirre for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C/NF) Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos called
<br>Ambassador Aguirre February 7 to discuss Spain's commitment
<br>to Afghanistan in advance of the February 8-9 NATO
<br>ministerial in Sevilla. The Ambassador had previously spoken
<br>with Defense Minister Alonso and National Security Advisor
<br>Casajuana on the same subject (reftel), and Moratinos was
<br>returning the Ambassador's call.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C/NF) The Ambassador told Moratinos that both he and
<br>Washington were disappointed by President Zapatero's decision
<br>not to increase Spain's troop commitment in Afghanistan. He
<br>noted that it was the Department's understanding after
<br>Moratinos and Secretary Rice met in Paris January 25 that
<br>Spain would be willing to be a more active partner in
<br>Afghanistan. The Ambassador also told Moratinos that the GOS
<br>should not interpret the Embassy's current silence in the
<br>media as in any way diminishing our disappointment with the
<br>decision.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C/NF) Moratinos replied that he believed there must have
<br>been a misunderstanding from the Paris meeting, saying that
<br>he intended simply to underscore Spain's commitment to NATO,
<br>ISAF and the mission in Afghanistan. He had not meant to
<br>suggest that the U.S. could count on a Spanish expansion of
<br>its forces.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C/NF) Turning to the Ambassador's initial comments,
<br>Moratinos said that the United States at times seemed to
<br>highlight the negative aspects of the bilateral relationship
<br>as it saw fit and often failed to focus on the positive. He
<br>outlined Spain's robust development assistance and military
<br>commitments to Afghanistan, including infrastructure and
<br>training programs. He argued that Spain is one of the lead
<br>contributors in Afghanistan, and he said that such
<br>commitments should underscore President Zapatero's commitment
<br>both to NATO and to ISAF. Moratinos suggested that no one is
<br>giving Spain credit for what it has done thus far.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C/NF) After clarifying that he was only offering his
<br>personal opinion without instructions, Moratinos speculated
<br>that the situation might have been different had Secretary
<br>Rice been able to visit in the fall of 2006 as initially
<br>planned, as she could have pressed President Zapatero on the
<br>importance of the mission. He expressed chagrin at the fact
<br>that the Secretary had not visited Spain and suggested that
<br>the U.S. only treated Spain as a first world NATO ally when
<br>convenient. The Ambassador replied that the Secretary
<br>maintains an unquestionably professional schedule and
<br>reiterated that the postponement of the fall 2006 visit was
<br>unavoidable. He did not mention the possibility of a March
<br>visit, but he reiterated USG disappointment with Spain's
<br>decision.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C/NF) COMMENT: Moratinos, who waited several hours to
<br>return the Ambassador's call, had clearly prepared and
<br>scripted his message. Noticeably agitated, he took to the
<br>offensive, whereas Alonso made clear his unhappiness with
<br>Zapatero's decision and Casajuana expressed greater
<br>understanding and sympathy with our position. END COMMENT.
