<br>
<br>¶1.  (C/NF) SUMMARY: During separate discussions with OSD
<br>Assistant Secretary for International Security Affairs
<br>Alexander Vershbow and EUR Deputy Assistant Secretary Spencer
<br>Boyer in early February, Roland Galharague, MFA
<br>A/S-equivalent for Continental Europe, adopted a defensive
<br>posture about the potential sale of Mistral class ships to
<br>Russia; expressed skepticism about the depth and durability
<br>of Russia's support for sanctions against Iran; acknowledged
<br>Putin's dominance in Russia while proposing, as a means to
<br>strengthen Medvedev, that we respond positively to his
<br>proposals for reforming European security and holding an OSCE
<br>summit; asserted that Serbia cannot win back Kosovo and also
<br>win entry into the EU; expressed pessimism about the future
<br>of Nagorno-Karabakh negotiations and about the impact of
<br>instability in Iran on Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Armenia;
<br>and claimed that Bosnia and Afghanistan could become
<br>difficult issues for trans-Atlantic relations this year
<br>because of the USG's alleged disengagement from Bosnia and
<br>its alleged failure to consult adequately with European NATO
<br>allies on strategy in Afghanistan.  END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>-----------------------------------------
<br>MISTRAL: FRENCH ADOPT A DEFENSIVE POSTURE
<br>-----------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2.  (C/NF) When asked about the potential sale of Mistral
<br>class ships to Russia, Galharague inquired as to why the USG
<br>seems to be singling out France for criticism on this issue.
<br>"I recently spoke to my Dutch counterpart," he reported, "and
<br>he said you have not approached him on this subject" despite
<br>recent Dutch (and Spanish) efforts to make similar sales.
<br>Furthermore, the Mistral is not "top end" military equipment,
<br>Galharague argued, describing it instead as a combination
<br>between "a truck and an oil ship" with some helpful
<br>navigation tools.  It will not contribute significantly to
<br>Russian military capabilities.  Russian leaders have been
<br>over-selling the military significance of the Mistral in
<br>order to quell domestic opposition to its purchase from
<br>abroad.  Some Russians consider the sale a harbinger of the
<br>end of shipbuilding in their country, and claim the ship
<br>could be built at home but would simply take longer.  The
<br>production and sale of armaments is a major industry in
<br>Russia, possibly second only to oil and gas.  In his February
<br>10 press conference, the Chairman of Russia's National
<br>Security Council, Nikolai Patrushev, seemed "very reticent"
<br>about the possible sale, according to Galharague.
<br>
<br>¶4.  (C/NF) Asked about Georgia's reaction to the possible
<br>sale, Galharague insisted that France has maintained "very
<br>good" relations with Tbilisi.  The GOF "strategy" for Georgia
<br>to recover its lost territory is to persuade the Tblisi
<br>government to engage with the leaders of the secessionist
<br>territories and to continue on their path toward EU
<br>accession.  The demands of accession -- such as internal
<br>democratic reforms and good relations with their neighbors --
<br>will serve Georgia and the region well.  Nonetheless,
<br>Galharague acknowledged that Tbilisi has good reason to fear
<br>Russia, given their recent history.  This ship will not,
<br>however, affect their strategic situation, Galharague argued:
<br>"The Russians have already invaded Georgia without the ship."
<br>
<br>¶5.  (C/NF) While acknowledging that Georgia and the Baltic
<br>countries feel threatened by Russia -- with reason --
<br>Galharague concluded that Russia is not a threat to us and
<br>there is no reason we should not sell equipment to them which
<br>does not fall into the realm of restricted armaments.  The
<br>Mistral class ship does not contain high end or sensitive
<br>technology, he insisted.
<br>
<br>-------------------------------------------
<br>RUSSIA'S COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP WITH IRAN
<br>-------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶6.  (C/NF) The Russians are currently benefiting from their
<br>helpful statements on Iran while realizing full well that
<br>China will water down any sanctions proposals, Galharague
<br>asserted.  When praising Russia's new stance, he argued, we
<br>should be cognizant of their complicated relationship with
<br>Iran.  Russians have an interest in strong ties with Tehran,
<br>especially because Iran is still a primary market for Russian
<br>arms sales.  On the other hand, were Iran to normalize its
<br>relations with western governments, it could develop into a
<br>major Russian rival for gas sales to the European market.  To
<br>balance various and competing elements of its relationship
<br>with Iran, Russia has an interest in serving as a
<br>"go-between" in the conflict between Iran and the west.  In
<br>fact, Galharague claimed, Russian leaders were furious when
<br>Turkey recently started to seize that mantel.
<br>

<br>
<br>---------------------
<br>MEDVEDEV VERSUS PUTIN
<br>---------------------
<br>
<br>¶7.  (C/NF) When discussing the comparative influence of
<br>President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin, Galharague
<br>claimed that Medvedev, whose initial gut reactions to events
<br>clearly differ from those of Putin, is trying to assemble his
<br>own power bases independent of the former President.  In the
<br>meantime, "power still rests with Putin," Galharague
<br>assessed.  Putin, not Medvedev, constantly juggles and
<br>balances competing domestic interests in Russia.  As a case
<br>in point, Galharague cited the Russian government's reaction
<br>to the financial crisis.  After the government painstakingly
<br>established a mechanism for determining how to divide
<br>stimulus funds among various economic sectors and private
<br>interests, Putin simply decided unilaterally who would
<br>receive state support.  In general, Galharague observed,
<br>Putin much prefers to focus on domestic issues rather than
<br>foreign policy.  Putin prefers cutting deals in the murky
<br>Russian business world to delving into the complexities of
<br>international politics.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------------
<br>STRENGTHEN MEDVEDEV BY RESPONDING TO HIS SECURITY PROPOSAL
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------------
<br>
<br>¶8.  (C/NF) Galharague described the long-standing French
<br>effort to strengthen Medvedev by respecting his official role
<br>as president of Russia, regardless of Putin's competing power
<br>and influence. "We treat Medvedev as president and address
<br>presidential issues with him."  They also seek to validate
<br>Medvedev's initiatives, regardless of the substantive
<br>content, in order to reward his efforts to put new ideas
<br>forward.  As an important example, Galharague mentioned
<br>Medvedev's proposal for revamping European security
<br>architecture.  Medvedev invested a lot of political capital
<br>in this effort, Galharague argued, and we should provide a
<br>positive response, even if we do not accept the proposals.
<br>For this reason, President Sarkozy sent Medvedev a letter of
<br>acknowledgment after receiving the proposal.  Tying this
<br>approach to USG policy toward Russia, Galharague several
<br>times asked how the USG plans to measure the success of the
<br>"reset" with Russia?  The French, he said, would like to know
<br>whether the USG has established benchmarks for progress, and
<br>they wonder how START negotiations might fit into this
<br>equation.
<br>
<br>-------------------------------------------
<br>EUROPEAN SECURITY: GOF SUPPORTS OSCE SUMMIT
<br>-------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶9.  (C/NF) Galharague stated that the French largely agree
<br>with us about how to address questions of European security,
<br>except in one area: they support the idea of an OSCE summit.
<br>While Paris concurs with the USG analysis that the Russian
<br>proposals for reforming Europe's security institutions
<br>contain a number of "unacceptable" elements, he argued that
<br>we must understand that "we're playing a game of judo -- we
<br>do not want to give the Russians a pretext to claim they're
<br>being ignored."  He added that the Russians are adept at
<br>manipulation.  "We constantly feel like we have a better hand
<br>but they're playing a better game -- it's the same in
<br>business and economic arenas."  Claims of disrespect by
<br>western nations resonate in Russian domestic politics, to our
<br>detriment, he warned.  Therefore, we must emphasize the
<br>positive elements of the Russian proposal and communicate a
<br>sincere willingness to engage.  An OSCE summit can help with
<br>these aims, Galharague argued, and at the same time support
<br>the Corfu process.  A summit would need to involve at least a
<br>minimum number of substantive issues, such as regional
<br>conflicts or the status of conventional forces in Europe, but
<br>by agreeing to move ahead with the summit we would put the
<br>onus back on Russia.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- -----
<br>BALKANS: SERBS CAN'T WIN IN BOTH KOSOVO AND THE EU
<br>--------------------------------------------- -----
<br>
<br>¶10.  (C/NF) Galharague asked that the USG work together with
<br>the EU to discourage the Serbians from proposing a new U.N.
<br>resolution on Kosovo, stating that Serbian Foreign Minister
<br>Jeremic "seems to believe Serbia can win on Kosovo and win EU
<br>entry.  We need to let him know this is not true."  Right
<br>now, Galharague reported, "the Serbs are furious with us (the
<br>French)" in response to the demarche the GOF delivered in
<br>Belgrade in early February (reftel) about Serbia's possible
<br>plans for a U.N. resolution.  "We delivered the message in
<br>very forceful terms."  In fact, the Serbs interpreted the
<br>demarche as a major change in position, Galharague reported.
<br>
<br>PARIS 00000207  003.2 OF 004
<br>
<br>The EU had thus far maintained the position that the issues
<br>of Kosovo and Serbian entry into the EU were not formally
<br>linked.  "There was no formal conditionality," Galharague
<br>said, adding that the Serbs now understand that to be a
<br>member of the EU they must eventually recognize Kosovo.  "We
<br>told them we do not want another Cyprus," he explained,
<br>referring to Cyprus' controversial EU accession in 2004 as a
<br>divided island where EU legislation remains partly
<br>"suspended" in the northern part of the island which is
<br>outside of the government in Nicosia's control.  Nonetheless,
<br>Galharague predicted the Serbs will likely go ahead with the
<br>U.N. resolution in any case, and the USG and the EU will be
<br>forced to oppose it.
<br>
<br>¶11.  (C/NF) Furthermore, Galharague asserted, before the
<br>Serbs join the EU, they will need to resolve key issues with
<br>Kosovo in the fields of justice, police, customs, transport,
<br>agriculture, and also any differences over names and
<br>terminology.  The best way for Serbia to address issues
<br>related to Kosovo is by working with the European Union Rule
<br>of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX).  "At the end of the day,
<br>though," he reiterated, "Serbia must recognize Kosovo if it
<br>wants to join the EU."
<br>
<br>------------------------------
<br>PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THE CAUCASUS
<br>------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶12.  (C/NF) The Nagorno-Karabakh negotiations appear to be at
<br>a "dead end," Galharague averred, adding that "Minsk (The
<br>Minsk Group) is going nowhere fast."  He noted that the
<br>French government is not in a position to push the Armenians
<br>at the moment because French citizens of Armenian origin
<br>"represent about 500,000 votes" and French regional elections
<br>will take place in March.  Other factors may soon impact the
<br>Caucasus region, he warned, such as instability in Iran.
<br>Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Turkmenistan all have important
<br>trade and energy ties with Iran and they could be immediately
<br>affected by the Iran sanctions bill currently making its way
<br>through the U.S. Congress.  At the same time, the effort to
<br>impose harsher U.N. sanctions may offer us an opportunity to
<br>further engage with those three countries about their
<br>approach to Iran.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----
<br>FUTURE USG-EU FLASHPOINTS: BOSNIA AND AFGHANISTAN
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----
<br>
<br>¶13.  (C/NF) When assessing potential issue areas where the
<br>USG and EU may differ during 2010, Galharague focused first
<br>on Bosnia.  He said the French are disappointed that the USG
<br>appears to have put all plans and actions on hold pending the
<br>elections in October.  Indeed, he implied that U.S. and EU
<br>officials have differing assessments of the need for
<br>continual engagement with the conflicting parties in Bosnia.
<br>Bosnian parties will not make progress without unity between
<br>the U.S. and the EU.  When the Americans disengage, even
<br>temporarily, Galharague claimed the Bosnians perceive it
<br>immediately and react accordingly: "The Americans are giving
<br>up, so why should we do this (make compromises)?"  The USG,
<br>the Spanish EU presidency, and High Representative Ashton
<br>should lead the charge in engaging this year -- "we need U.S.
<br>backing now," he urged.  As a lever to press the Bosnians
<br>forward on constitutional issues, the EU may be able to use
<br>the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights, which
<br>declared that the Bosnian Constitution does not conform with
<br>European human rights standards.
<br>
<br>¶14.  (C/NF) Galharague described Afghanistan as the second
<br>potential trans-Atlantic flashpoint in 2010: "There is an
<br>emerging feeling the war is not jointly owned and managed."
<br>President Obama waited eight months to make a decision and,
<br>during that period, at no point did European opinion factor
<br>into his deliberations, according to Galharague.  DAS Boyer
<br>firmly disagreed, citing USG consultations and discussions
<br>with French officials in Paris and in Washington, DC.
<br>Galharague acknowledged these discussions took place, but
<br>claimed the question Americans posed to their European NATO
<br>allies was not "What do you think?" but "How many troops can
<br>you put on the ground?"  More recently, he said, the USG has
<br>begun contemplating engagement with elements of the Taliban
<br>without consulting European NATO allies.  The French would
<br>like to know, for instance, what this engagement might mean
<br>for our future relations with Pakistan and India.
<br>
<br>¶15.  (C/NF) In purely political terms, Galharague explained
<br>that Afghanistan has developed into a difficult issue,
<br>especially in France.  With the French death toll in
<br>Afghanistan having reached 40, he noted, local politicians
<br>have found themselves increasingly faced with grieving
<br>families, to whom they must explain the purpose of the war.
<br>
<br>PARIS 00000207  004.2 OF 004
<br>
<br>"The perception is that we're there because the Americans are
<br>there," he said.  "We're not sure where we're going and we're
<br>not being asked or consulted."  Initially, the majority of
<br>Europeans supported the war in Afghanistan, invoking Article
<br>Five of the NATO Charter and committing a "fairly high"
<br>amount of troops and resources.  But now "no one knows the
<br>purpose" of the war.  "Perhaps the French government should
<br>have made a better show of the consultations" that did take
<br>place, Galharague admitted, "but to display them you have to
<br>have them."
<br>
<br>¶16.  (C/NF) EMBASSY COMMENT: Galharague is not ultimately
<br>responsible for the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, which is
<br>handled by a separate cell within the MFA, so his comments
<br>may not reflect the views of those who regularly engage with
<br>the USG on this issue.  Notably, when discussing public and
<br>official perceptions of the war in Afghanistan, he made no
<br>mention of SRAP Holbrooke's two visits to Paris in the last
<br>three months, or post's constant exchanges about Afghanistan
<br>with French officials at the senior and working levels.
<br>Galharague focused on a perception of minimal consultation,
<br>which he admitted could persist regardless of reality.  END
<br>COMMENT.
<br>
