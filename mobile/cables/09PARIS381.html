<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) SUMMARY: France accepted four former Guantanamo Bay 
<br>(GITMO) detainees with claims to immigration status in France 
<br>in July 2004 and an additional three in March 2005. Ministry 
<br>of Interior contact Christophe Chaboud noted that, unlike 
<br>other European countries visited by Washington officials (UK 
<br>and Albania), the majority of detainees repatriated by France 
<br>are still considered a security risk and are treated as such. 
<br>With the exception of the one detainee released without 
<br>prejudice (out of seven detainees repatriated), the French 
<br>intelligence service actively monitors the others and judges 
<br>they have not ceased association with persons tied to 
<br>extremist activities. France is still working to advance the 
<br>detainee issue within the EU and is considering accepting 
<br>detainees (reftel). French MFA DAS-equivalent for security 
<br>affairs Martin Juillard and Laurent Pic of Prime Minister 
<br>Fillon's office stressed that an EU common position would be 
<br>of "clear interest" to the USG, warning that countries might 
<br>attempt to "cherry pick" detainees if a framework were not in 
<br>place. Juillard added that a common approach would also 
<br>create a more fluid process for moving detainees. France 
<br>would appreciate as much information as possible from the USG 
<br>to help push the issue within the EU and in securing French 
<br>public support. Pic noted the mid-March meetings in 
<br>Washington with EU Vice President Jacques Barrot and the 
<br>Czech minister of interior could help to resolve many of 
<br>these issues. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>French Approach to Detainee Reintegration 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) France accepted four former detainees with claims 
<br>to immigration status in France in July 2004 and an 
<br>additional three in March 2005. In a March 10 meeting with 
<br>Ministry of Interior contacts Christophe Chaboud, Phillippe 
<br>Hanin and Francois Thuillier, and Ministry of Justice 
<br>official Philippe Tran Van, Chaboud noted that, unlike the UK 
<br>and Albania, the majority of detainees repatriated by France 
<br>are still considered a security risk and are treated as such. 
<br>Of the seven detainees originally repatriated, only Mustaq 
<br>Ali Patel was released without prejudice. Chaboud explained 
<br>that Patel was a religious fundamentalist who had been held 
<br>by the Taliban and was not deemed to be a threat. The six 
<br>other former detainees were held in custody and tried. Five 
<br>were convicted and sentenced to prison terms ranging from one 
<br>to one and half years. Chaboud explained that while all six 
<br>of the detainees were considered extremists, only five had 
<br>trained in terrorist training camps. An appeals court 
<br>overturned the conviction of the five on February 24, saying 
<br>the security services who interviewed the defendants at GITMO 
<br>did not have the legal authority to do so. Although the 
<br>court case is ongoing and it is unclear if the reversal will 
<br>stand, the French security services will continue to monitor 
<br>the former detainees regardless of the final outcome of the 
<br>legal battle. The French intelligence service explained that 
<br>they actively monitor the repatriated detainees. Philippe 
<br>Hanin said that France still considers the six former 
<br>detainees a security risk. When pressed, Hanin added that 
<br>the detainee of greatest concern is Brahim Yadel, whose 
<br>history of large wire transfers has worried investigators 
<br>(Yadel was also suspected of plotting to attack the 1998 
<br>football World Cup in France). 
<br>
<br>EU Common Position: Still in Process 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) French MFA DAS-equivalent for security affairs 
<br>Martin Juillard and Laurent Pic of Prime Minister Fillon's 
<br>office clarified the evolving EU approach to a common 
<br>position for accepting Guantanamo detainees. While an EU 
<br>common position has still not been established, France has 
<br>been working with EU partners since January 2009 to formulate 
<br>a position that would take into consideration security 
<br>issues, especially for Schengen countries (reftel). Pic 
<br>noted that previous EU acceptance of Palestinians from the 
<br>Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem (reftel) could serve as a 
<br>useful precedent for granting residency permits within the 
<br>Schengen system. Pic added that the discussions within the 
<br>EU are still quite difficult; the French are looking for ways 
<br>to put in place a procedure for accepting detainees while not 
<br>pressuring countries that are unwilling to resettle them. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) Juillard explained that an EU common position would 
<br>be of "clear interest" to the USG to avoid "cherry picking" 
<br>by EU countries willing to accept detainees as well as 
<br>creating a more fluid process for moving detainees. That 
<br>said, Pic noted that there were some EU members -- 
<br>unspecified -- still resistant to the idea of accepting 
<br>detainees. For this reason the GOF would appreciate as much 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00000381 002.2 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>information as possible from the USG to help push the issue 
<br>within the EU and to secure French public support. Some of 
<br>the EU debate over a common position, Juillard said, needed 
<br>to focus on forming some procedures to create contingency 
<br>plans when a detainee's first choice of accepting country is 
<br>refused by that country. Perhaps, he suggested, the GOF, EU 
<br>and USG could work together collectively to craft a mechanism 
<br>for other EU countries to help fill the void. Juillard and 
<br>Pic noted that the idea of a clearing house (reftel) as part 
<br>of a common position was intended to provide a data-sharing 
<br>mechanism rather than as a forum for collective 
<br>decision-making, which the French believe would hinder the 
<br>decision-making process. 
<br>
<br>Increased Coordination and Additional Issues 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) Juillard said the GOF needed to know the status of 
<br>the USG's review process. He noted that since Prime Minister 
<br>Fillon and Foreign Minister Kouchner announced that France 
<br>would consider accepting detainees (reftel), French public 
<br>opinion has continued to sour. France realizes that the 
<br>issue will be a tough sell to the French public, so any help 
<br>the U.S. can provide to assist the GOF with selling the idea 
<br>to the French public would be greatly appreciated. Another 
<br>"sensitive" concern for the French is the possibility of 
<br>extradition of former Guantanamo Bay detainees as well as 
<br>prosecutions and detentions, Juillard said. In addition, the 
<br>French would like to have more information on reintegration 
<br>procedures so that detainees did not resume terrorist 
<br>activities. Such procedures could be legal and financial. 
<br>Before France could consider accepting detainees, the GOF 
<br>would like to interview the detainees in such a way that 
<br>would "not cause" legal problems, Juillard said. Pic said 
<br>France and the EU hope many of these issues will be resolved 
<br>during the mid-March meetings in Washington with EU Vice 
<br>President Jacques Barrot and Czech Minister of Interior 
<br>Langer.
