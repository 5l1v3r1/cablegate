<br>SUBJECT: THE PRESIDENT'S JUNE 6 MEETING WITH FRENCH 
<br>PRESIDENT SARKOZY 
<br>
<br>REF: A. PARIS 1844 
<br>¶B. PARIS 1871 
<br>
<br>Classified By: CDA Thomas J. White for reasons 1.4 (B & D). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) The meeting between the President and French 
<br>President Nicolas Sarkozy in Heiligendamm June 6 will be 
<br>their first official encounter since then-Interior Minister 
<br>Sarkozy met briefly with the President on September 12, 2006. 
<br>The two presidents will meet on the same day that Defense 
<br>Secretary Gates and new French Defense Minister Herve Morin 
<br>
<br>SIPDIS 
<br>commemorate D-Day on the beaches of Normandy. France's new 
<br>President -- who has promised France's citizens that he will 
<br>say what he will do and do what he has said -- has declared 
<br>that improving France's relationship with the United States 
<br>is one of his top priorities. We should take him at his word 
<br>and seek to exploit this opening to reinvigorate our 
<br>strategic relationship with France, since close cooperation 
<br>with France -- bilaterally, within NATO, at the UNSC, and 
<br>through the EU -- is a key force multiplier. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) That said, we will need to take into account the fact 
<br>that Sarkozy was elected President primarily with a mandate 
<br>for domestic reform. He will devote his first weeks and 
<br>months in office to delivering on his promises and 
<br>implementing that mandate. Even if Sarkozy handily wins the 
<br>June legislative elections, as currently expected, he will 
<br>face vigorous opposition from those with entrenched 
<br>interests, including unions and the coalition of students and 
<br>their parents who fear a loss of France's vaunted social 
<br>protections. In the foreign policy arena, as was made clear 
<br>in his May 16 meeting with German Chancellor Merkel on the 
<br>same day he assumed office, Sarkozy will focus in the short 
<br>term on the run-up to the June 21-22 EU Council meeting as a 
<br>means of finally re-imparting institutional momentum 
<br>following the French and Dutch rejection of the EU 
<br>constitutional treaty. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) The President will want to welcome Sarkozy's election 
<br>and the possibilities it represents for reforming and 
<br>re-energizing France and Europe, while acknowledging the 
<br>challenges that Sarkozy faces in the years ahead. Sarkozy 
<br>greatly enjoys political strategizing (the basis of his close 
<br>relationship with UK PM Blair), and can be expected to talk 
<br>at some length about his strategy of moving toward the 
<br>center, winning the upcoming legislative elections, and 
<br>pushing through an ambitious reform program in his first 
<br>months of office. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) The President should also welcome Sarkozy's 
<br>commitment to a U.S.-French relationship based on mutual 
<br>confidence and candor, and will want to address Sarkozy's 
<br>desire for frequent contact on the full range of issues. We 
<br>should suggest that NSA Hadley would hope to have the same 
<br>kind of close relationship with Sarkozy's diplomatic advisor, 
<br>Jean-David Levitte, and seek Sarkozy's agreement that they be 
<br>mandated to begin a quiet dialogue on how we might 
<br>reinvigorate the U.S.-French strategic relationship, 
<br>including through a larger and more positive French 
<br>leadership role within NATO. The President can assure 
<br>Sarkozy that this would not be at the expense of the EU -- we 
<br>do not see this as zero-sum -- but that we are striving for a 
<br>win-win outcome for both organizations. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) We believe it is essential for the President to raise 
<br>two issues in this initial meeting, Afghanistan and Iraq. On 
<br>Afghanistan, France has been sending mixed signals. MFA 
<br>Political Director Araud has counseled us to try early on to 
<br>move Sarkozy away from Chirac's pessimistic view of 
<br>Afghanistan, and lay the basis for a more activist, 
<br>multifaceted French effort there. Unfortunately, in 
<br>responding to the Taliban hostage-taking of a French NGO 
<br>worker, Sarkozy suggested that a long-term French presence 
<br>would not be "decisive," implying that he would consider 
<br>reducing France's commitments. Although we have since been 
<br>assured by Levitte that French policy has not changed, we 
<br>believe it is essential to obtain that commitment from 
<br>Sarkozy himself. NATO/ISAF requires France's continuing 
<br>engagement; as with Bosnia or Kosovo, when it comes to the 
<br>Alliance it must remain "in together and out together." 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) On Iraq, Sarkozy recognizes that an American defeat 
<br>is also a defeat for Europe, and he told the President that 
<br>he would "help get the U.S. out of Iraq." We take for 
<br>granted that, at a minimum, this means that the needling 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00001995 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>rhetoric of the past will be dropped, including repeated 
<br>calls to offer a "horizon" for an eventual troop withdrawal. 
<br>Beyond that, it is extremely unlikely that France would put 
<br>troops on the ground, but the President should seek a new 
<br>level of engagement that could be demonstrated, for example, 
<br>by visibly working with Arab governments in support of a 
<br>political settlement in Iraq. France could also raise the 
<br>level of its representation at, and support for, the regional 
<br>conferences with Iraq's neighbors now underway. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Sarkozy is likely to have two priority issues of his 
<br>own to raise, climate change and Darfur. On the first, 
<br>Sarkozy signaled during his election victory speech that 
<br>climate change was his top priority, and he called on the 
<br>U.S. to "take the lead" in the fight against global warming. 
<br>Sarkozy has stopped short of calling on the U.S. to join 
<br>Kyoto, but he publicly advocates the idea of a carbon tax on 
<br>imports from non-Kyoto signatories as a means of defending 
<br>Europe's CO2 emissions trading system (ETS). The President 
<br>should express our interest in enhancing collaboration on 
<br>climate change with France, with a view to greater 
<br>cooperation on a positive science and technology agenda. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Darfur is likely to be a high-profile issue for 
<br>Sarkozy and his Foreign Minister, former UN Kosovo Czar, NGO 
<br>(Doctors Without Borders) activist, and human rights 
<br>interventionist Bernard Kouchner, which would permit the 
<br>Sarkozy government to put more of a human rights stamp on its 
<br>foreign policy. (Sarkozy has himself called for greater 
<br>human rights emphasis in French foreign policy: he has been 
<br>sharply critical of Russia on Chechnya, and opposes the 
<br>lifting of the EU arms embargo on China, on human rights 
<br>grounds.) The President should assure Sarkozy of our desire 
<br>to work closely with Sarkozy Darfur, with the aim of 
<br>reproducing the kind of success we have had together on 
<br>Lebanon. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) As time permits, we would recommend that the 
<br>President touch on the need to maintain continuity on 
<br>U.S.-French cooperation on Lebanon/Syria and Iran, including 
<br>the need to ratchet up sanctions and reinforce them outside 
<br>the UN framework if necessary. The President should also 
<br>stress the importance of maintaining Western unity on Kosovo 
<br>in the face of Russian opposition. This might offer a chance 
<br>for a brief exchange on Russia more generally, including on 
<br>missile defense, and lead to a brief assessment by Sarkozy's 
<br>assessment of EU-Russia relations. (Sarkozy has a much more 
<br>critical view of Russia than did Chirac.) 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Finally, Sarkozy's opposition to Turkish entry into 
<br>the EU is public and likely unshakeable: it is one of his 
<br>few defining foreign policy issues. He has heard our 
<br>strategic rationale for bringing Turkey into the EU, but has 
<br>made clear that whatever the ramifications of keeping Turkey 
<br>out, he opposes bringing 70 million Muslims into Europe, 
<br>further diluting its identity and exacerbating France's own 
<br>sensitive immigration issue (although he puts his argument in 
<br>terms of "Turkey is in Asia Minor, not Europe.") The 
<br>President, while noting that this is an issue that only the 
<br>EU can decide, should nonetheless seek to persuade Sarkozy to 
<br>avoid any early or dramatic closing of the door; not taking a 
<br>decision at this time would allow the accession negotiations 
<br>so indispensable to Turkey's own internal reforms to proceed 
<br>uninterrupted.
