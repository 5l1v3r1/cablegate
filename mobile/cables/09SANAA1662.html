<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) SUMMARY. Despite repeated ROYG accusations of
<br>Tehran's material and financial support to the Houthi rebels
<br>in Sa'ada and increasingly belligerent media exchanges
<br>between Yemen and Iran, Iranian influence in Yemen has thus
<br>far been limited to informal religious ties between Yemeni
<br>and Iranian scholars and negligible Iranian investment in the
<br>energy and development sectors. While Iran has good
<br>strategic reasons to involve itself in Yemeni affairs -
<br>including Yemen's proximity to Saudi Arabia and the presence
<br>of a large Zaydi Shiite population ) the only visible
<br>Iranian involvement remains the Iranian media's proxy battle
<br>with Saudi and Yemeni outlets over support for the Houthis.
<br>Significant gaps exist in post's knowledge of Iranian
<br>activities in Yemen due to the sensitivity of the subject and
<br>post's very limited access to events in Sa'ada. Post
<br>believes that while documented influence is limited, Iran's
<br>strategic interests in Yemen merit close monitoring in the
<br>future. END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>Iran-royg relations
<br>-------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) After two high-profile Iranian official visits to
<br>Sana'a in early 2009, the formal bilateral relationship has
<br>rapidly deteriorated as a result of renewed fighting in
<br>Sa'ada governorate. Iran maintains an embassy in Sana'a
<br>headed by Ambassador Mahmoud Zada. According to DATT
<br>sources, Iran is not providing any military training to the
<br>Yemenis, and there have been no announced military sales
<br>between the two countries in recent years. Iranian Speaker
<br>of Parliament Ali Larijani visited Yemen in May 2009 to
<br>discuss Iranian investment in Yemen's energy and
<br>infrastructure sectors and the bilateral relationship.
<br>During Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki's June
<br>visit to Sana'a, his second in two years, both nations
<br>maintained at least a public appearance of normal bilateral
<br>cooperation. Mottaki told local media at the time, "Iran is
<br>pursuing an honest and friendly approach towards Yemen. Iran
<br>wants progress, security and prosperity for Yemen."
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) With the August onset of the sixth war in Sa'ada,
<br>however, the ROYG has reverted to its previous position that
<br>Iran is intent on meddling in Yemen's internal affairs.
<br>Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) Chief of Protocol Abdullah
<br>al-Radhi, who spent over a decade in Tehran as a student and
<br>diplomat, including a tour as Yemen's ambassador to Iran,
<br>echoed the near-unanimous attitude of ROYG officials when he
<br>told the DCM on August 23 that he believes Iran wants a
<br>strong political card to play in Yemen similar to Hizballah
<br>in Lebanon. He said that Yemen tried to normalize the
<br>relationship with the visits of Larijani and Mottaki, but
<br>Yemen "cannot accept" Iranian attempts to convert the Yemeni
<br>Zaydis to Twelver Shiism. (Note: The ROYG views Zaydi
<br>Shiites as less extremist and closer in practice to Sunnis
<br>than the Twelver Shiism predominant in Iran. End Note.)
<br>Radhi also said that the Iranians are still upset about
<br>Yemen,s support for Iraq during and since the first Gulf War.
<br>
<br>Iran and the houthis
<br>--------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) Although the ROYG maintains that Iran is providing
<br>material and financial support to the Houthi rebels in
<br>Sa'ada, little evidence has surfaced to date that supports
<br>this claim. President Saleh told General Petraeus in a July
<br>26 meeting that the National Security Bureau (NSB) had a DVD
<br>showing Houthi rebels training with Hizballah uniforms and
<br>tactics. (Note: In a follow-up conversation, NSB Deputy
<br>Director Ammar Saleh claimed no knowledge of the DVD. End
<br>Note.) In an August 17 meeting, Saleh told Senator McCain
<br>that Iran was working against Yemeni stability because it
<br>believed that a weakened Yemen would hurt the U.S. and Saudi
<br>Arabia, both traditional enemies of Iran. In the same
<br>meeting, NSB Director Ali Mohammed al-Ansi claimed that the
<br>ROYG had arrested two separate "networks" of Iranians in
<br>Yemen on charges of espionage in connection with the Houthis
<br>and that one of the accused admitted to providing $100,000
<br>every month to the Houthis on behalf of the Iranian
<br>
<br>Sanaa 00001662 002 of 004
<br>
<br>
<br>government. Ansi told Deputy National Security Advisor John
<br>Brennan on September 6 that the ROYG was unable to share the
<br>evidence from this case because it was still in the courts.
<br>(Comment: Since the outbreak of hostilities in 2004, the ROYG
<br>has used many different arguments, including the Houthis'
<br>alleged ties to Iran and Hezballah, to attempt to convince
<br>the USG to declare the Houthis a Foreign Terrorist
<br>Organization (FTO). In 2008, the ROYG gave post a dossier of
<br>information purporting to show ties between the Houthis and
<br>Iran. Post passed on the file to the inter-agency community
<br>in Washington. Analysts agreed that the information did not
<br>proove Iranian involvement in Sa'ada. End Note.)
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) ROYG spokesman Hassan al-Lawzi has repeated
<br>statements throughout the three weeks of fighting in Sa'ada
<br>accusing Iran of supporting the Houthi rebels. On September
<br>1, Foreign Minister Abubakir al-Qirbi publicly warned Iran
<br>that interference in the Sa'ada conflict would have a
<br>negative impact on bilateral relations and that, if such
<br>interference continued, Yemen could be forced to make "hard
<br>decisions," according to media reports. Qirbi also lodged an
<br>official complaint with the Iranian Embassy in Sana'a
<br>detailing Yemen's displeasure with Iranian support for the
<br>Houthis. Director for External Financial Relations at the
<br>Ministry of Finance Fouad al-Kohlani told PolOff on August 19
<br>that the Houthis' level of organizational sophistication and
<br>military successes against government forces indicate a
<br>higher level of financial resources than the Houthis could
<br>attain on their own. He speculated that because of its
<br>strategic interest in gaining a foothold near Saudi Arabia,
<br>Iran was likely the Houthis' financial backer. The Iranians,
<br>for their part, continue to deny any interference in Sa'ada.
<br>On August 23, the Iranian Embassy in Bahrain stated that Iran
<br>had no connections to events in Yemen and "supports any
<br>movement that works to unify the ranks of the Yemeni people,"
<br>according to Bahraini media. The Iranian Embassy in Sana'a
<br>repeated these statements on September 7, Yemeni media
<br>reported.
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) Media reports on August 22 cited ROYG officials
<br>claiming to have uncovered six storehouses of Houthi-owned,
<br>Iranian-made weapons ) including machine guns, short-range
<br>rockets and ammunition ) near Sa'ada City. In an August 25
<br>meeting, however, Ministry of Defense Chief of Staff Major
<br>General Ahmed al-Ashwal told the OMC Chief that a limited
<br>number of weapons "of Iranian manufacture" were found in the
<br>area, but would not provide information on the quantity or
<br>type, and avoided a direct request from EmbOffs to view the
<br>weapons. In June, ROYG military contacts told the DATT that
<br>relations between the two countries were "strained" because
<br>of Iran's support for the Houthis, and denied that the ROYG
<br>was either communicating or in cooperation with Iranian ships
<br>conducting counter-piracy missions in the Gulf of Aden.
<br>(Note: GRPO reporting confirms ROYG refusals to allow Iranian
<br>vessels access to Aden harbor, reportedly over ROYG concern
<br>that Iran was using Eritrea to ship weapons to the Houthis.
<br>End Note.) According to xxxxx, however, the
<br>Houthis do not need to receive weapons from outside of Yemen
<br>because they can easily capture or purchase them from the
<br>Yemeni military. xxxxx, who communicates on a daily basis with Houthis and
<br>other Sa'ada residents, agreed that the Houthis' weapons came
<br>from the Yemeni military ) either through capture or
<br>abandonment on the battlefield or via black-market arms deals
<br>by corrupt military commanders - and not from an external
<br>source such as Iran.
<br>
<br>¶7. (S/NF) The general consensus among civil society is that
<br>Iranian government influence in Sa'ada is minimal, but the
<br>Houthis might receive some financial support from Iranian
<br>groups or individuals. xxxxx, who travels to Sa'ada
<br>frequently, told PolOff on August 26 that Iran had not been
<br>involved historically in the conflict in Sa'ada, but with
<br>changingdomestic circumstances in Iran, might have become
<br>involved in the latest round of fighting. He addd, however,
<br>that he has no knowledge of any Iranian nationals in Sa'ada
<br>in recent years. (Note: The ROYG used to grant Iranians
<br>living in Yemen hajj visas to travel overland to Mecca, but
<br>stopped issuing the visas some time ago because the ROYG was
<br>uncomfortable about Iranians traveling through Sa'ada into
<br>Saudi Arabia. End Note.) xxxxx speculated that Iranian groups are likely giving
<br>
<br>Sanaa 00001662 003 of 004
<br>
<br>
<br>money to the Houthis, but he does not know to what extent.
<br>With that money, the Houthis buy weapons from corrupt
<br>elements of the Yemeni armed forces that sell weapons and
<br>munitions, xxxxx alleged. Civil society actors, however,
<br>were also unable to provide any concrete evidence of the
<br>involvement of any Iranian nationals in Sa'ada.
<br>
<br>¶8. (S/NF) To date, Iran's most visible involvement in the
<br>sixth war in Sa'ada has been the Iranian media's proxy battle
<br>with Saudi and Yemeni outlets over Iranian support for the
<br>Houthi rebels (Ref B). Continuing a tradition that dates
<br>back to the earliest stages of the Sa'ada conflict, the ROYG
<br>has accused Iran of financially and materially supporting the
<br>Houthi rebels. For its part, Iran ) through state media
<br>outlets including English-language Press TV and
<br>Arabic-language al-Alam TV ) has claimed that Saudi Arabia
<br>is directly involved in the military campaign against the
<br>Houthis. The Sa'ada conflict has thus become a propaganda
<br>war between Yemen, eager to enlist the support of its Sunni
<br>Arab neighbors and the U.S., and Iran, allegedly seeking to
<br>nurture a Shi'a proxy force on the Arabian Peninsula. On
<br>August 24, Iranian al-Alam TV quoted rebel leader Yahya
<br>al-Houthi as denying Iranian support for the Houthis.
<br>Iranian media have consistently shown video footage intended
<br>to embarrass the ROYG, including images of alleged soldiers
<br>fleeing the fighting and Houthis dancing on top of abandoned
<br>ROYG armored vehicles.
<br>
<br>Iran and the south
<br>------------------
<br>
<br>¶9. (S/NF) Little evidence ) or even debate ) exists
<br>regarding Iran's role with the Southern Movement. The
<br>southern secessionist movement, which is formally a secular
<br>organization that has among its ranks former Sunni jihadists,
<br>has, to date, no established connections with either the
<br>Houthis or Iran.xxxxx, told PolOff in May and July that the movement
<br>had repeatedly rejected offers of collaboration with the
<br>Houthis. xxxxx told PolOff on September 6 that the
<br>movement's leaders wanted to continue peacefully advocating
<br>for separation, rather than affiliating themselves with the
<br>Houthis or external actors willing to advocate violence such
<br>as Iran. Some limited evidence, on the other hand, indicates
<br>that Iran might be a more willing partner with southerners
<br>fed up with the current regime. According to DATT contacts,
<br>the ROYG asked the then-Iranian military attache to leave
<br>Yemen in 2008, purportedly because he had attempted to make
<br>contact with separatists in the southern governorates. He
<br>has not been replaced. Former Yemeni Ambassador to Iran
<br>Radhi said that the Iranian Ambassador in Muscat had been
<br>instructed to "study the south of Yemen," especially
<br>Hadramout and Shabwa governorates.
<br>
<br>Iran's soft power in yemen
<br>---------------------------
<br>
<br>¶10. (S/NF) Perceived Iranian influence in other arenas is
<br>limited to informal religious ties between Yemeni and Iranian
<br>scholars and negligible Iranian investment in the energy and
<br>development sectors. Despite Yemen's 40% Zaydi Shiite
<br>population, religiously-based interaction between Yemen and
<br>the world's largest Shi'a country is limited, perhaps because
<br>the form of Shiism Zaydis practice hews closer to Sunni Islam
<br>than the Twelver Shiism of Iran. Ambassador Radhi, however,
<br>told the DCM on August 23 that he believes there is a lot of
<br>"coordination on Yemen" between Qom and Najjaf, with 40-50
<br>Yemenis studying Islam in Najjaf, and some (NFI) studying in
<br>Qom as well. (Note: Given that Yemen has over 9 million
<br>Zaydis, it appears that the number of religious students
<br>studying in Iraq and Iran combined is very small. End Note.)
<br>
<br>¶11. (S/NF) Iranian direct investment in the Yemeni economy
<br>is negligible, according to local Iranian businessmen xxxxx, 
<br>and xxxxx.
<br>The only recent significant Iranian commercial activity in
<br>Yemen involves the ROYG,s tortuous experience hiring the
<br>Tehran-based Parsian HV Substations Development Company to
<br>build the substation of the Marib 1 power plant (Ref C).
<br>ROYG officials at all levels told EconOff that the decision
<br>to hire the Iranian firm was purely political, rather than
<br>economic, stemming from a desire in 2005 to expand relations
<br>with Iran. The delays caused by the technical incompetence
<br>
<br>Sanaa 00001662 004 of 004
<br>
<br>
<br>of the Iranian firm have resulted in hundreds of millions of
<br>U.S. dollars in foregone savings from switching away from
<br>expensive diesel and towards natural gas in the power sector.
<br>(Comment: Post believes Iranian commercial activity will
<br>remain limited in Yemen, absent future politically-driven
<br>bilateral trade missions. End Comment.) The Iranian
<br>government funds two hospitals in Sana'a that are among the
<br>better medical facilities in the capital. The management of
<br>the hospitals is Iranian, but the staff is largely local.
<br>
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶12. (S/NF) Yemen's formal relationship with Iran is by all
<br>accounts relatively fragile, and has continued to deteriorate
<br>in recent months. Since the start of the Sa'ada conflict in
<br>2004, Yemen has looked to pin the Houthis' strength and
<br>resilience in fighting the ROYG on the Iranians. Despite
<br>Yemen's seemingly heartfelt concerns that Iran is backing the
<br>Houthi rebels and the ROYG's desire to convince its powerful
<br>friends (the U.S. and Saudi Arabia) of Iran's nefarious
<br>intentions in Yemen, it has to date been unable to produce
<br>any concrete evidence of what it says is wide-scale meddling.
<br>It is post's firm belief that if Yemen had any concrete
<br>evidence that the Houthis had connections to either Hizballah
<br>or Iran, it would have produced it immediately; the lack of
<br>such evidence likely indicates that the ROYG lacks any real
<br>proof of such links. On the other hand, Iran has clear
<br>strategic interests in gaining a foothold in Yemen (Sa'ada)
<br>and developing a proxy ally in the Houthis similar to
<br>Hizballah in Lebanon. Post believes that, while it is worth
<br>keeping an eye on Iranian activities in Yemen, Tehran's reach
<br>to date is limited. END COMMENT.
