<br>SUBJECT: KARZAI DIALOGUE ON U.S.-AFGHAN RELATIONS CONTINUES
<br>
<br>REF: KABUL 1767
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Karl W. Eikenberry for Reasons 1:4 b,d
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) SUMMARY.  President Karzai and I continued our
<br>dialogue on the future of U.S.-Afghan relations (reftel) in
<br>our weekly meeting, July 7.  We were joined by National
<br>Security Advisor Rassoul.  Karzai discussed his priorities
<br>for the next five years as outlined in his draft election
<br>manifesto.  The President's manner was significantly more
<br>relaxed and warm than in meetings the previous week when he
<br>was often agitated, accusing the U.S. of working against him
<br>(reftel).  As a result, our discussion was more constructive
<br>and forward-looking.  When Karzai drifted towards a
<br>reiteration of his anti-U.S. conspiracy theories on several
<br>occasions, I was able to refocus the conversation on how the
<br>U.S. and Afghanistan governments can work together in the
<br>near and medium term to achieve combined success.
<br>
<br>REVIEWING KARZAI'S ELECTION MANIFESTO FOR NEXT FIVE YEARS
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) As we discussed the long-term goals outlined in
<br>Karzai's draft election manifesto, I reiterated the U.S.
<br>commitment to continuing our close partnership with
<br>Afghanistan, regardless of whom the Afghan people elect in
<br>August.  I then outlined what the U.S. was seeking from the
<br>relationship over the next five years and commented on some
<br>points in Karzai's proposed agenda.  Under President Obama's
<br>strategy for Afghanistan, I noted, we would continue to
<br>pursue a more coherent regional approach, while assisting the
<br>Afghan government build a more secure and economically
<br>sustainable country that would never again permit sanctuary
<br>for international terrorism.  I emphasized the importance of
<br>achieving meaningful progress in the near term to prove to
<br>the U.S. and the international community that our ongoing
<br>investment of lives and resources in Afghanistan was
<br>producing tangible, lasting results for the Afghan people.
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) I took issue with the foreign policy section of
<br>Karzai's draft manifesto which stressed Afghanistan's
<br>relations with the Islamic world and with Palestine, followed
<br>by a rather weak comment on relations with the U.S.  I
<br>pointed out this did not accurately reflect our robust
<br>partnership and raises questions regarding Karzai's
<br>perspective on the bilateral relationship.
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF)  I also noted the document's lack of a strong
<br>emphasis on strengthening Afghan National Security Forces
<br>(ANSF) and judicial system.  Five years down the road, I
<br>said, success would be defined by whether the ANSF's
<br>increased capacity allowed it to take the lead in planning
<br>and conducting effective military operations, as well as
<br>apprehending and detaining insurgents under Afghan legal
<br>authority.  (NOTE: We are seeking a translation of the draft
<br>of Karzai's manifesto passed to us earlier this month and
<br>will transmit septel once translation is complete.)
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) Karzai then mentioned that after the election he
<br>planned to call a national jirga to make a recommitment to
<br>the Afghanistan-U.S. relationship and our partnership in the
<br>war against terror.  This would, he claimed, clarify the
<br>military assistance aspect of the relationship and counter
<br>what many Afghan's perceive to be the "unfocused presence" of
<br>international forces, reducing public concerns about those
<br>forces.  (Note: We have since learned that a later draft of
<br>Karzai's manifesto may include this call for a traditional
<br>loya jirga to address the presence of U.S. forces in
<br>Afghanistan.  If true that Karzai intends to convene a
<br>traditional loya jirga instead of a constitutional loya
<br>jirga, it would reflect a disappointing continuation of
<br>Karzai's tendency to govern through reliance on personalities
<br>of the past, rather than on democratic institutions.)
<br>
<br>AMBASSADOR: FOCUS SHOULD BE ON AFGHAN GOVT WINNING HEARTS AND
<br>MINDS
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) Karzai then returned to a familiar theme, his wish
<br>for Afghan-U.S. relations to recover the spirit of 2002-04 -
<br>a period Karzai sees as a "golden age" in the relationship.
<br>He would like for U.S. forces to again be able to drive their
<br>humvees through villages, greeted warmly by villagers who
<br>would shout, "Good morning, Sergeant Thompson."  Karzai
<br>claimed, as he has many times, that his concern over the
<br>erosion of public trust in the U.S. was a driving factor in
<br>his increasingly strident criticism regarding civilian
<br>casualties, night raids and detentions.
<br>
<br>¶7. (S/NF) I reminded Karzai that we had agreed our discussion
<br>would be forward-looking, rather than dwell on past
<br>grievances.  I also reminded him the U.S. and ISAF had made a
<br>
<br>KABUL 00001892  002 OF 003
<br>
<br>tremendous effort over the past year to avoid civilian
<br>casualties, noting that in a recent engagement in Helmand
<br>where one U.S. marine had been killed and 25 wounded, we had
<br>not employed close air support or artillery.  Karzai agreed
<br>there had been a dramatic reduction in civilian casualty
<br>incidents, saying he intended to make a public statement
<br>noting his gratitude for U.S. efforts.  I welcomed such a
<br>statement, observing that the U.S. continues to bear a heavy
<br>cost for our assistance to Afghanistan in the American lives
<br>lost as we work to ensure a more secure future here.
<br>
<br>¶8. (S/NF) I also took issue with Karzai's "golden age"
<br>perspective, reminding him that I had been in Afghanistan
<br>during this period.  It was clear, even at that time, that
<br>trouble was brewing as the focus on security and
<br>reconstruction drifted and declined due to lack of resources
<br>and a comprehensive strategy.  I urged Karzai to recognize
<br>that President Obama is providing the U.S.-Afghan partnership
<br>with the tools necessary to build a lasting foundation for
<br>Afghanistan's success, based on sustainable security,
<br>accountable government, and a working economy.  I stressed to
<br>Karzai that our primary goal in Afghanistan is not to win
<br>public support for the U.S., but rather to help the Afghan
<br>government win its own people's hearts and minds by enabling
<br>it to provide basic security and effective governance to the
<br>people.  In five years, we expect to still have forces in
<br>Afghanistan, but with the majority as advisors and trainers
<br>in support of ANSF in areas such as logistics, air support,
<br>intelligence, etc.  Returning to Karzai's hopes for the
<br>future, I told him Americans do not long for a day in which
<br>their soldiers are hailed throughout Afghanistan; they are
<br>instead growing impatient for the day a respected Afghan Army
<br>and national police force are fully capable of providing
<br>security to the Afghan populace.  Time is not unlimited.
<br>
<br>KARZAI'S ANTI-U.S. RHETORIC UNDERMINES ADVOCACY FOR CONTINUED
<br>SUPPORT
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------
<br>
<br>¶9. (N/SF) I then raised with Karzai his regular claim to
<br>senior U.S. visitors that the U.S. has "failed in
<br>Afghanistan."  I noted that such rhetoric could potentially
<br>undermine continued bipartisan support for our current
<br>strategy of expanding U.S. assistance to Afghanistan.  I said
<br>some criticism was fair, but in these meetings with senior
<br>U.S. officials, Karzai regularly failed to acknowledge any
<br>meaningful progress resulting from U.S. contributions.  By
<br>condemning U.S. efforts while failing to take any
<br>responsibility for Afghanistan's problems, Karzai was not
<br>presenting the Afghan government (or himself) as a
<br>responsible partner in this relationship, a partner cognizant
<br>of and sensitive to mutual obligations.  Leaving meetings
<br>with Karzai, officials could easily conclude that the U.S.
<br>has accomplished little or nothing here and question why we
<br>continue to devote American lives and resources to the
<br>effort.  Karzai indicated that he understood the need to
<br>present a more balanced perspective.  (Note.  It remains to
<br>be seen whether Karzai can or will refrain from this "blame
<br>America" tactic he uses to deflect criticism of his
<br>administration.  Indeed, his inability to grasp the most
<br>rudimentary principles of state-building and his deep seated
<br>insecurity as a leader combine to make any admission of fault
<br>unlikely, in turn confounding our best efforts to find in
<br>Karzai a responsible partner.)
<br>
<br>ELECTIONS: KARZAI (STILL) SUSPICIOUS OF U.S. INTENTIONS
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---------
<br>
<br>¶10. (S/NF) Revisiting a favorite grievance, Karzai asserted
<br>that early in the year some officials in the Obama
<br>Administration had encouraged potential opposition candidates
<br>to run.  Karzai indicated he felt Secretary Clinton had been
<br>very supportive and noted relations with VP Biden were much
<br>improved.  He still felt some senior officials were actively
<br>working to undermine him.  Those officials, he said, were
<br>openly discussing election runoff scenarios that would give
<br>the opposition an opening to unite against him. Karzai
<br>claimed that in a fair and free election he would win on the
<br>first round.  If there were "irregularities" and the election
<br>went to a second round, Karzai believed opposition candidates
<br>would play the "ethnic card" to marshal support, undermining
<br>national unity.
<br>
<br>¶11. (S/NF) I challenged his assertion that Administration
<br>officials had promoted opposition candidates.  I emphasized
<br>that, in fact, our Mission has gone to great pains to remain
<br>balanced in engagement with presidential candidates and to
<br>promote a level-playing field, I reminded Karzai that I had
<br>decided not to visit Mazar-e-Sharif because of Governor
<br>Atta's overt campaigning for Abdullah and his reported
<br>refusal to comply with MOI Atmar's dismissal of two policemen
<br>in the province for corruption.  Karzai replied, with humor,
<br>
<br>KABUL 00001892  003 OF 003
<br>
<br>that he conceded in this instance that the U.S. had been
<br>even-handed in demonstrating its commitment to fair
<br>elections.
<br>
<br>COMMENT
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶12. (S/NF) Although more relaxed than in recent meetings,
<br>Karzai remains deeply suspicious of U.S. intentions and
<br>actions regarding key opposition candidates, frequently
<br>citing U.S.-based support groups for Abdullah Abdullah and
<br>Ashraf Ghani.  Karzai is currently most concerned about a
<br>potential Abdullah coalition.  (He dismissed Ghani, saying
<br>that he will know Ghani has admitted defeat when he asks for
<br>a position in Karzai's new government.)  Karzai clearly
<br>expected (or hoped) to receive the same U.S. support for his
<br>candidacy that he received in the 2004 election, and
<br>interprets our neutral stance in this election as evidence
<br>that the U.S. is "against" him.  I will continue to use my
<br>weekly dialogues with Karzai to clarify our position on this
<br>and other issues, while focusing him on the way forward in
<br>U.S.-Afghan relations with an emphasis on our shared desire
<br>that progress needs to continue, regardless of who wins the
<br>election.  In future discussions, I will continue to stress
<br>the importance of Afghanistan assuming a more meaningful
<br>partnership role, and focus on key issue areas such as ANSF
<br>growth and assumption of lead responsibility for security,
<br>reconciliation, government accountability, and sustainable
<br>development.  Through this engagement, we will also seek to
<br>avoid the gap between the U.S. and Karzai widening to the
<br>point that we will lose precious time closing the distance
<br>should he be re-elected.
