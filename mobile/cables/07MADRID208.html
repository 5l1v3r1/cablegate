<br>SUBJECT: SPAIN: ZAPATERO'S DECISION ON AFGHANISTAN FIRM
<br>
<br>REF: MADRID 00197
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre for reasons 1.4 (b) & (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C/NF) President Zapatero is highly unlikely to in the
<br>near term reverse his statement that Spain will not augment
<br>its troop presence in Afghanistan, thereby nixing the
<br>possibility of staffing the ISAF XI HQ in Kabul (with some
<br>120-150 personnel). This conclusion stems from Ambassador
<br>Aguirre,s conversations over the past several days with
<br>senior level Spanish officials, including Defense Minister
<br>Alonso and National Security advisor-equivalent Carles
<br>Casajuana. A response to a call to Foreign Minister
<br>Moratinos is pending.
<br>¶2. (C/NF) In several conversations with Ambassador Aguirre,
<br>Defense Minister Alonso did not hide that he was despondent
<br>and clearly crestfallen that Zapatero had made this
<br>statement, which he made just one day after Alonso,s comment
<br>in Afghanistan that the GOS was considering sending more
<br>troops. Alonso said that Zapatero's statement, which caught
<br>him completely by surprise, had been made it in such a way as
<br>to box the government in on the issue with little or no
<br>wiggle room, no political way to finesse a change of
<br>position, even a nuanced one. Alonso said he had gone back
<br>to Zapatero to try to get him to change his mind, but to no
<br>avail. (The UK Ambassador to Spain had also pressed GOS, and
<br>reported to the Ambassador that GOS had also expressed to him
<br>that Alonso had pressed the issue with Zapatero but with no
<br>results).
<br>
<br>¶3. (C/NF) Alonso told the Ambassador that the reason for
<br>Zapatero's decision is based totally on domestic politics,
<br>and had nothing to do with NATO per se. The Ambassador noted
<br>that Spain was coming into an electoral season as
<br>regional/local elections loom in May and later in March 2008.
<br>Alonso acknowledged that we had a good understanding of the
<br>political scene here. Alonso hoped that this should not
<br>terminate the good defense relations between the US and
<br>Spain. The Ambassador told Alonso that we are well versed
<br>in the ups and downs of this relationship over the past
<br>several years and that we expect our high points, and then
<br>soon after, a low point. But this issue is critical to NATO
<br>and to the Allies fighting in Afghanistan and calls into
<br>question Spain's commitment to NATO. Alonso insisted Spain
<br>remained committed to NATO; I said that failure to take the
<br>HQ component it is very serious.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C/NF) The Ambassador called Zapatero's national security
<br>advisor Carles Casajuana to make clear Washington's and the
<br>Embassy's disappointment about the Zapatero decision.
<br>Casajuana said he had had a conversation with NSC European
<br>Senior Director Judy Ansley a few days ago. Casajuana said
<br>that Zapatero had made the decision mostly for domestic
<br>political purposes and for some national security reasons.
<br>He said the GOS had sold the Spanish public on military
<br>participation in Afghanistan on the basis of its
<br>humanitarian, reconstruction and stability mission, and much
<br>less so as an aggressive military deployment. Casajuana said
<br>that as the military situation has become more difficult,
<br>this creates political problems in terms of public
<br>perceptions in a very heated Spanish political environment.
<br>An increase in the Spanish deployment - even to staff the
<br>ISAF HQ in Kabul - would be blown out of proportion by the
<br>opposition Popular Party, which has severely criticized the
<br>Zapatero government for any troop deployments, charging that
<br>Zapatero is hypocritical for having condemned Spanish
<br>deployments under the Aznar government, only to do so himself
<br>now that he is in power. At the same time, Casajuana said,
<br>from the national security/military strategy perspective,
<br>Spain fully supports the military imperative of NATO,s
<br>current strategy, but is not willing to participate in an
<br>augmentation of Spanish troops. He said the GOS will invest
<br>in training Afghan security forces, which is very expensive,
<br>and remains fully committed to the Spanish deployments in
<br>Western Afghanistan.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C/NF) Casajuana insisted that Spain wants a good
<br>relationship with the US and to have an excellent bilateral
<br>meeting between SecDef Gates and Defense Minister Alonso, and
<br>hopes for a successful Ministerial. Ambassador Aguirre
<br>repeated our concern and disappointment about the decision by
<br>President Zapatero not to meet Spain's commitment to staff
<br>the Kabul ISAF HQ. He further indicated that our public
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000208 002.2 OF 002
<br>
<br>
<br>position to this turn of events was still under review. In
<br>the event that we underplay the seriousness of the situation
<br>in the media, Casajuana needed to understand that a reasoned
<br>reaction did not diminish our deep concern and
<br>disappointment.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C/NF) In a pending call to Foreign Minister Moratinos,
<br>Ambassador Aguirre will make clear that Secretary Rice had
<br>understood Moratinos to say during their Jan. 25 meeting in
<br>Paris (on the margins of the Lebanon Donor's Conference) that
<br>Spain would meet its commitments in Afghanistan, and that
<br>Washington is very disappointed.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C/NF) Embassy Comment: Zapatero,s comments caught his
<br>entire team by surprise, including Alonso and Moratinos, the
<br>new MOD SYG for Policy Luis Cuesta, and MFA Political
<br>Director (number three-equivalent Dezcallar). Working with
<br>A/S Fried and USNATO Ambassador Nuland, who have also been in
<br>touch with senior Spanish officials, Embassy is examining
<br>next steps with the Spanish government, including our public
<br>stance. We want to avoid boxing Zapatero even more tightly
<br>into the corner he has constructed for himself, hoping
<br>against hope that at the NATO Defense Ministerial in Seville
<br>(or SecDef's Bilateral meeting with Alonso) we find some
<br>shred of hope that a way can be found for him to meet the
<br>ISAF commitment without increasing troop presence, or other
<br>formula to fix the problem or make up for it in a big way.
<br>At the same time, we don't want to let Zapatero off the hook
<br>on something so important to the Alliance and Spain's
<br>commitment to it. Alonso, who has actively sought good
<br>relations with the US and found ways to advance that
<br>interest, will be receptive to SecDef's arguments on the
<br>subject, but he has been undercut publicly by President
<br>Zapatero despite their long friendship and close ties.
