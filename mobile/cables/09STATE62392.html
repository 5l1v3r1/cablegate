<br>SUBJECT: (S) REPORTING AND COLLECTION NEEDS: BULGARIA 
<br> 
<br>REF: STATE 18756 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: SUZANNE MCCORMICK, DIRECTOR, INR/OPS.  REASON: 1.4(C). 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (S/NF) This cable provides the full text of the new 
<br>National HUMINT Collection Directive (NHCD) on Bulgaria 
<br>(paragraph 3-end) as well as a request for continued DOS 
<br>reporting of biographic information relating to Bulgaria 
<br>(paragraph 2). 
<br> 
<br>¶A. (S/NF) The NHCD below supercedes the NHCD contained in Ref 
<br>C and reflects the results of a recent Washington review of 
<br>reporting and collection needs focused on Bulgaria.  The NHCD 
<br>sets forth a list of priorities (paragraph 3) and reporting 
<br>and collection needs (paragraph 4) intended to guide 
<br>participating USG agencies as they allocate resources and 
<br>update plans to collect information on Bulgaria.  The 
<br>priorities may also serve as a useful tool to help the 
<br>Embassy manage reporting and collection, including 
<br>formulation of Mission Strategic Plans (MSPs). 
<br> 
<br>¶B. (S/NF) This NHCD is compliant with the National 
<br>Intelligence Priorities Framework (NIPF), which was 
<br>established in response to NSPD-26 of February 24, 2003.  If 
<br>needed, GRPO can provide further background on the NIPF and 
<br>the use of NIPF abbreviations (shown in parentheses following 
<br>each sub-issue below) in NHCDs. 
<br> 
<br>¶C. (S/NF) Important information responsive to the NHCD often 
<br>is available to non-State members of the Country Team whose 
<br>agencies participated in the review leading the the NHCD,s 
<br>issuance. COMs, DCMs, and State reporting officers can assist 
<br>by coordinating with other Country Team members to encourage 
<br>relevant reporting through their own or State Department 
<br>channels. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S/NF) State biographic reporting ) including on 
<br>Bulgarians: 
<br> 
<br>¶A. (S/NF) The intelligence community relies on State 
<br>reporting officers for much of the biographical information 
<br>collected worldwide.  Informal biographic reporting via email 
<br>and other means is vital to the community's collection 
<br>efforts and can be sent to the INR/B (Biographic) office for 
<br>dissemination to the IC.  State reporting officers are 
<br>encouraged to report on noteworthy Palestinians as 
<br>information becomes available. 
<br> 
<br>¶B. (S/NF) Reporting officers should include as much of the 
<br>following information as possible when they have information 
<br>relating to persons linked to Bulgaria: office and 
<br>organizational titles; names, position titles and other 
<br>information on business cards; numbers of telephones, cell 
<br>phones, pagers and faxes; compendia of contact information, 
<br>such as telephone directories (in compact disc or electronic 
<br>format if available) and e-mail listings; internet and
