<br>SUBJECT: SPAIN: GOVERNMENT DENIES RUMORED ETA TALKS
<br>
<br>
<br>¶1. (U) On June 19 conservative Spanish media outlets ABC and
<br>El Mundo claimed that Deputy Foreign Minister Bernardino Leon
<br>participated in negotiations with the Basque terrorist group
<br>ETA after the group ended its "permanent" cease-fire on June
<br>¶6. The news reports sparked strong condemnations from the
<br>opposition Popular Party and others who questioned whether
<br>the government had broken its promise to end all negotiations
<br>with ETA.
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) Leon rejected the allegations on June 20. Spanish
<br>daily El Pais (close to the Zapatero government) reported
<br>that "Leon has sharply denied that he participated in
<br>meetings with leaders of ETA on behalf of the government and
<br>he has said that the information published by El Mundo and
<br>ABC was false." According to government sources, neither Leon
<br>nor any member of the administration participated in the
<br>alleged meetings.
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) COMMENT: We do not have independent confirmation of
<br>either of these reports. We were not aware of any Foreign
<br>Ministry involvement in dealing with ETA, which is seen here
<br>as a domestic issue, and most contact with governments such
<br>as France on the subject have been through police channels.
<br>Spanish President Zapatero now needs to appear as tough as
<br>possible in dealing with ETA after the cease-fire rupture and
<br>in the face of intense scrutiny and criticism by the
<br>opposition. He is also on the record with strong comments
<br>forswearing future negotiations with the terrorist group.
<br>Leon is a fairly prominent figure in Spanish political
<br>circles and has not previously, to our knowledge, been
<br>involved in ETA policy-making. If the GOS were to re-engage
<br>in negotiations with ETA, it likely would choose a less
<br>visible official with previous experience on ETA.
