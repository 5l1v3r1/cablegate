<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: Spanish Political Director Rafael Dezcallar
<br>and Director General for North America and Europe Pepe Pons
<br>told DCM separately that Spain would oppose any EU consensus
<br>statement on Kosovo recognition in Brussels February 18.
<br>Separately, Spanish Deputy DG for ESDP Carlos Fernandez-Arias
<br>told Poloff that the maximum statement Spain could entertain
<br>would be a "two-sentence" statement of the outcome from
<br>Pristina and a restatement of the EU's commitment to the
<br>Western Balkans. The GAERC also plans to send a message of
<br>"no more business as usual" by issuing conclusions on Burma,
<br>Kenya, and Chad. END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>//KOSOVO AND SERBIA//
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) On February 13, Spanish Political Director Rafael
<br>Dezcallar told the DCM that Spain would almost certainly not
<br>be able to join consensus on Kosovo recognition at the GAERC
<br>in Brussels (ref B), but that the decision would be made by
<br>Moncloa. Spanish Vice President Fernandez De La Vega,
<br>speaking at the GOS weekly press briefing February 15, said,
<br>"Spain does not support a unilateral declaration of
<br>independence...Despite the fact that recognition is an
<br>exclusively national competency...the government is working
<br>and will continue working until the last moment so that the
<br>EU will have a common and active position toward the future
<br>of Kosovo...Our position has not changed." Director General
<br>for North America and Europe Pepe Pons told DCM February 15
<br>that Spain would oppose any movement toward EU recognition at
<br>the GAERC. Noting European concerns about Spanish opposition
<br>due to the elections (ref C), the DCM emphasized that no one
<br>seriously believed that Kosovo would be an electoral issue,
<br>nor did any credible politician see any correlation between
<br>Kosovo and Spanish internal disputes. Pons replied that
<br>Kosovo would be an election issue, saying that Kosovo is in
<br>the headlines and the debate in Europe is drawing the
<br>government's attention away from its campaign priorities.
<br>The DCM countered that there was no guarantee that the GOS
<br>would be in a position to support Kosovar independence after
<br>the elections, given that a PSOE victory would mean weeks of
<br>negotiations to form a coalition government, while a PP
<br>government would certainly oppose Kosovar independence. Pons
<br>acknowledged this was true, but said that at least then
<br>Kosovo's independence would not be distracting the government
<br>during the campaign. Pons said that the Russian Ambassador
<br>had been to see him earlier on February 15 and had left the
<br>impression that the Russians would react negatively but
<br>passively to the UDI.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Deputy Political Director for ESDP Carlos
<br>Fernandez-Arias told Poloff the same separately.
<br>Fernandez-Arias said that Spain would not accept any EU
<br>statement that hinted at recognition but would, if pressed,
<br>consider a very brief "no more than two sentence"
<br>acknowledgment of the outcome in Pristina on February 17
<br>along with a restatement of the EU's commitments in the
<br>Western Balkans. Fernandez-Arias noted that the question of
<br>recognition is a prerogative of each member nation and is
<br>completely separate from EULEX and the naming of an EU High
<br>Representative, which he said are going forward regardless.
<br>Fernandez-Arias said that the EU would not be able to broach
<br>the EU Stabilization and Association Agreement with the Serbs
<br>again until well after Kosovo's independence, once things
<br>have calmed down a bit.
<br>
<br>//MEPP//
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Fernandez-Arias said that there would likely be
<br>little discussion of the Middle East, but that Spain is
<br>concerned about finding a way to keep the Rafah crossing open
<br>to provide a pressure release valve for Gaza. He said that
<br>last month's border events had weakened Abbas and the PA and
<br>had shown the need for such a valve. The means to administer
<br>that border were more challenging, he said, given the
<br>inability to negotiate with Hamas.
<br>
<br>//BURMA//
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) According to Fernandez-Arias, Spain supports the EU
<br>in Burma and does not want the situation to return to the
<br>status quo ante. The GAERC will issue conclusions on Burma
<br>calling for continued pressure and sanctions but FM Moratinos
<br>feels it is also important to send positive signals to the
<br>Burmese regime.
<br>
<br>//CHAD//
<br>
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000174 002.2 OF 002
<br>
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) With plans moving forward once more for EUFOR's
<br>deployment to Chad and CAR, Spain is pushing conclusions that
<br>will first and foremost keep forward momentum for EUFOR and
<br>also make a qualified statement of support for President Deby
<br>that cannot be interpreted as a carte blanche for the Chadian
<br>government to exact reprisals.
<br>
<br>//KENYA//
<br>
<br>7, (C) The GAERC will issue conclusions on Kenya calling for
<br>dialogue and supporting the UN, and calling for an end to
<br>"business as usual."
