<br>¶1. (C) Summary: In advance of the October 24 visit to Madrid
<br>of US Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez, Post presents a
<br>brief update on several of the most important pending or
<br>recently completed terrorism or criminal cases in the Spanish
<br>judicial system. Spain has made great strides in disrupting
<br>terrorist cells and frustrating would-be terrorist plots and
<br>we remain pleased with Spain's counter-terrorism cooperation.
<br>However, its national prosecutors continue to have
<br>difficulty building cases that can stand up in the courts and
<br>recent Spanish Supreme and national court decisions freeing
<br>alleged Al-Qaeda suspects are an important factor to consider
<br>as we pursue improved judicial cooperation with Spain. End
<br>Summary.
<br>
<br>-------------------------------
<br>High-profile Al-Qaeda Suspects
<br>-------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) Spain's National Court on October 11 acquitted
<br>Lahcen Ikassrien after finding insufficient evidence that he
<br>was a member of either Al-Qaeda or of the Abu Dahdah terror
<br>cell in Spain, or that he fought alongside the Taliban in
<br>Afghanistan. Ikassrien is a Moroccan national and former
<br>Guantanamo detainee transferred to Spanish custody in July
<br>¶2005. The court refused to admit any prosecution evidence
<br>that was obtained during his detention in Guantanamo or any
<br>information gleaned from intercepted phone calls in Spain.
<br>Post advised in Reftel A that this might occur, due to the
<br>unfortunate similarities the Ikassrien case had with that of
<br>accused terrorist Hamed Abderrahaman Ahmed, known in the
<br>media as the "Spanish Taliban." As reported in Reftel A, the
<br>Spanish Supreme Court announced on July 24 that it had
<br>annulled the six-year prison sentence handed down to
<br>Abderrahaman in September 2005 by Spain's national court.
<br>The court found that Spanish prosecutors could not use any
<br>evidence collected during their interrogation of Abderrahaman
<br>while he was being held at Guantanamo under conditions the
<br>court termed, "impossible to explain, much less justify."
<br>The Spanish prosecutor in the Ikassrien case had sought an
<br>eight-year jail sentence for the accused and tried
<br>unsuccessfully to build a case against Ikassrien that
<br>excluded evidence obtained in Guantanamo, noting publicly
<br>that Spanish authorities had obtained more than enough
<br>evidence of Ikassrien's membership in the Abu Dahdah terror
<br>cell prior to his stay in Guantanamo. It is unclear whether
<br>Ikassrien can be tried on any other terror-related charges.
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) In a separate case, Spanish authorities on October
<br>3 released Taysir Alony, who in September 2005 was sentenced
<br>to seven years in prison for membership in Al-Qaeda, for
<br>humanitarian reasons stemming from a serious heart problem.
<br>The Spanish Ministry of Interior is forcing Alony to wear a
<br>locator bracelet and monitoring his activities.
<br>
<br>------------------------
<br>CIA Flights and Prisons
<br>------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) Despite President's Bush recent announcement that
<br>there are no longer any terrorist suspects held in "secret
<br>prisons," this issue continues to dominate press headlines in
<br>Spain. On the front page of its October 15 edition, leading
<br>Spanish daily El Pais reported that the founder of Al-Qaeda
<br>in Spain has been in a "secret CIA prison" for a year.
<br>Sensational headlines in the Spanish press continue to claim
<br>that Syrian-born Spanish national named Mustafa Setmarian was
<br>turned over to the US by Pakistan authorities at the end of
<br>¶2005. The press reporting claims that Setmarian sowed the
<br>seeds of Jihad in Spain during the 1980s, but that the
<br>Spanish national court cannot request his extradition because
<br>he has not been officially arrested.
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) Along similar lines, and as we reported in REFTELS
<br>B and C, the CIA flights inquiry remains a hot discussion
<br>topic in Spain. On October 9, German national Khaled
<br>al-Masri testified for three hours in a Spanish national
<br>court and claimed that he was kidnapped and tortured by CIA
<br>officers during five months in 2004. He said he was taken
<br>from Macedonia to Kabul on a flight that he believed could
<br>have stopped in Palma de Mallorca. Al-Masri said he would
<br>not be able to identify any members of the crew on board the
<br>flight from Macedonia, but he would be able to recognize some
<br>of those who interrogated him in Kabul. As noted in Reftel
<br>C, post continues to be concerned that Judge Moreno, the
<br>
<br>MADRID 00002657 002.2 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>Spanish judge involved in this case, as part of Spain's
<br>highly independent judiciary, may determine that Spanish law
<br>allows him to claim "universal jurisdiction" on cases
<br>involving alleged torture and abuse. Such a determination
<br>may provide him the authority to adjudicate events that
<br>transpired in a third country if it is proven that related
<br>events occurred in Spain. Spanish government officials,
<br>including President Zapatero, continue to maintain their firm
<br>public stance that the flights did not violate any Spanish
<br>laws. However, Foreign Minister Moratinos expressed concern
<br>in front of the EU Parliament last month that, "our territory
<br>could have been used not to commit any offense, but as a
<br>stop-over to commit them in other countries." Moratinos has
<br>also urged the European Union to more vigorously investigate
<br>the presence of secret CIA prisons in other European
<br>countries. Spanish press reports that Judge Moreno in the
<br>near future will allow the national prosecutor to call other
<br>witnesses, including the airport authorities of Palma de
<br>Mallorca and the aircraft handling services.
<br>
<br>----------------------
<br>Madrid Train Bombings
<br>----------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Despite the passage of more than two and a half years
<br>since the Madrid train bombings occurred on March 11, 2004,
<br>and the near universal acceptance by the Spanish public and
<br>terrorism experts that they were perpetrated by Al-Qaeda
<br>sympathizers with the goal to punish Spain for its
<br>participation in the Iraq War, a segment of the opposition
<br>Popular Party (PP) and the newspaper El Mundo continue to
<br>allege a Socialist party conspiracy and cover up and claim
<br>that the Basque terrorist group ETA had some link with the
<br>March 11 attacks. The highly-charged political clash over
<br>the Madrid bombing investigation has heightened the climate
<br>of bad blood between the opposition PP and the ruling
<br>Socialist government and has greatly hindered the pace of the
<br>government's prosecution of the attacks. Spain is currently
<br>holding 29 individuals for their alleged connection to the
<br>bombings and prosecutors plan to charge these individuals
<br>with 191 counts of murder and 1,755 counts of attempted
<br>murder. The Spanish National Court has recently rejected
<br>various appeals from the accused and said that the trials,
<br>scheduled to begin in February 2007, may proceed. The
<br>National court in late September asked the Spanish Ministry
<br>of Justice to send an extradition request to Italy to bring
<br>Rabei Osman el-Sayed, known as "Muhammad the Egyptian,"
<br>temporarily to Spain to face trial in connection with the
<br>Madrid bombings.
<br>
<br>----------------------
<br>The Detergent Command
<br>----------------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) In a separate case pending before Spanish courts,
<br>the national prosecutor will seek a total of 142 years in
<br>prison for six Islamists arrested in January 2003 in
<br>Barcelona and Girona. These individuals are known in the
<br>press as "The Detergent Command," due to their possession of
<br>large quantities of detergents that police believe were to
<br>serve as ingredients for explosive devices. According to the
<br>prosecutor, these individuals were preparing a terrorist
<br>attack against a military base in the south of Spain, which
<br>may have been the base at Rota that the US shares with the
<br>Spanish navy and air force. The prosecutor will seek 32
<br>years for Muhammad Tahraoui, alleged leader of the Detergent
<br>Command, and 22 years each for his alleged accomplices,
<br>Muhammad Amine BenaMoura, Ali Kaouka, Ismail Boudjelthia,
<br>Muhammad Nebbar and Sohuil Kouka.
<br>
<br>---------------
<br>The Couso Case
<br>---------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU) Although not related to terrorism, the case of Jose
<br>Couso--the Spanish television cameraman killed in Baghdad in
<br>April 2003 during a firefight between US forces and Saddam's
<br>army--may return to national prominence after a British
<br>inquest earlier this month implicated US soldiers in the
<br>death of a British journalist in southern Iraq in March 2003.
<br>Couso's death sparked protests in a country that was
<br>vehemently against the Iraq invasion and friends and
<br>relatives of Couso have tried for years to bring a wrongful
<br>death case against the US soldiers of the Third Infantry
<br>Division involved in the firefight. The Spanish national
<br>court in March 2006 claimed it had no jurisdiction and
<br>refused to hear the case, but Couso supporters appealed to
<br>the Spanish Supreme Court the following month and we are
<br>still awaiting the high court's ruling. Although we have yet
<br>to see any Spanish reaction to the findings of the British
<br>
<br>MADRID 00002657 003.2 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>inquest, there is a possibility that Couso's family and their
<br>supporters will increase pressure on the Spanish Supreme
<br>Court to allow charges to be brought against the US soldiers.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Comment: Spain is a serious and committed partner in
<br>our global war on terror and we remain pleased with the
<br>efforts of Spanish law enforcement, intelligence and judicial
<br>organizations to combat the Islamic extremist threat.
<br>However, Spanish police, prosecutors, and magistrates
<br>building legal cases against disparate and amorphous terror
<br>cells are struggling to develop evidence sufficient enough to
<br>meet the high threshold set by the Spanish courts. Spain has
<br>a highly independent judiciary that carefully guards this
<br>independence (a major achievement of the post-Franco era),
<br>and this is an important factor to consider as we pursue
<br>increased judicial cooperation with Spain in terrorism cases.
<br>Nonetheless, some of the recent Supreme and national court
<br>decisions can clearly be seen as a criticism of US detainee
<br>policies in Guantanamo that are highly unpopular among the
<br>Spanish. Embassy Madrid looks forward to using next week's
<br>visit of Attorney General Gonzalez and his delegation to
<br>engage Spanish government officials on a range of important
<br>legal and judicial issues to encourage them to take an even
<br>more active role in the fight against global terrorism.
