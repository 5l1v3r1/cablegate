<br>SUBJECT: SECRETARY GATES' TURKEY BILATERAL VISIT: 
<br>SCENESETTER 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Ambassador James F. Jeffrey, Reasons 1.4 (a,b,d) 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (S) PM Erdogan welcomed President Obama's reiteration of 
<br>support to the fight against the PKK during the December 7 
<br>meeting in the Oval Office, but the Secretary should expect 
<br>questions about how we will operationalize that commitment as 
<br>plans to withdraw from Iraq move forward.  A key issue will 
<br>be how to reduce the gap between the time when the U.S. is no 
<br>longer able to provide ISR support and when we will be able 
<br>to help Turkey acquire its own capability.  On missile 
<br>defense, we will look for the Secretary's help in advancing 
<br>our work with Turkey to persuade the Turks to allow a key 
<br>radar system to be based here.  The Turks are struggling to 
<br>define what they will need in terms of NATO political cover 
<br>to lessen the high cost - both in terms of domestic politics 
<br>and in relations with Iran - that Erdogan's government 
<br>believes it will have to pay should they agree. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S) Although our agenda with Turkey is broad and complex, 
<br>the following issues are likely to come up during the 
<br>Secretary's trip: 
<br> 
<br>"Need To Raise" 
<br>---------------- 
<br> 
<br>- Our commitment to continue sharing real-time intelligence 
<br>to support Turkey's counter-PKK fight, but caution that the 
<br>process for Turkey to acquire an armed UAV system from the 
<br>U.S. will be long and complex. (para 3-5, 14) 
<br> 
<br>- The need for a NATO BMD system with Turkey's participation 
<br>and the Iranian threat against NATO interests. (para 6-9) 
<br> 
<br>- Appreciation for Turkey's efforts on Afghanistan/Pakistan, 
<br>particularly for its new commitments to training security 
<br>forces. (para 10-11) 
<br> 
<br>- Appreciation for support to OIF/OEF through Turkey's 
<br>territory, including the Incirlik Cargo Hub; easing transit 
<br>of non-lethal mil cargo shipments from Iraq to Afghanistan. 
<br>(para 12) 
<br> 
<br>- Our advocacy support for Raytheon and Sikorsky on sales of 
<br>air defense systems and utility helicopters (para 13). 
<br> 
<br>"Be Ready To Respond On" 
<br>------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>- Pressure for direct U.S. milops against the PKK (paras 5) 
<br> 
<br>- Turkish requests for 24/7 Predator coverage of the 
<br>Turkey-Iraq border to counter PKK operations and activities 
<br>(para 5). 
<br> 
<br>- Turkish requests for immediate delivery of AH-1W 
<br>helicopters (para 15) 
<br> 
<br>Counter - PKK Operations: Still Turkey's Top Priority 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------- 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) Turkey's counter-terrorist efforts against the PKK 
<br>have evolved in the past year and have expanded beyond 
<br>military action alone.  Although the government's renamed 
<br>National Unity Project (initially called the "Kurdish 
<br>Opening") was not fully developed when launched and appears 
<br>to be moving slowly, the government has increased social and 
<br>economic support to ethnic Kurds in southeast Turkey, 
<br>dramatically broadened the rights of Kurds to use their own 
<br>language, and increased educational opportunities as well. 
<br>It is post's view that the military success against the PKK, 
<br>supported by our intelligence-sharing operation, has given 
<br>the civilians the political space to explore this opening and 
<br>to deal directly with Masoud Barzani and other Iraqi Kurds. 
<br>Turkish military operations against the PKK continue, 
<br>however, and on October 6, 2009 Parliament extended the 
<br>government's mandate to conduct cross-border operations 
<br>against the PKK in Iraq for another year.  Turkey's leaders 
<br>have learned from us and from their own experience that only 
<br> 
<br>a whole-of-government approach will succeed against the PKK 
<br>insurgency. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) Our November 2007 decision to share operational 
<br>intelligence was a turning point for the bilateral 
<br>relationship, and President Obama's declaration before the 
<br>Turkish Parliament in April 2009 and during his oval office 
<br>meeting with Erdogan in December 2009 of our continuing 
<br>commitment to support Turkey's fight against the PKK were 
<br>warmly welcomed.  Our cooperation has helped to improve the 
<br>bilateral relationship across the board, particularly by 
<br>making it difficult for PKK terrorists to use northern Iraq 
<br>as a safe haven.  We can never reiterate enough our 
<br>continuing committment, as President Obama did effectively 
<br>with PM Erdogan in December. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) Nevertheless, Turkish causalities are still occurring. 
<br> Turkey still looks for more support, and will press us for 
<br>more concrete action before the U.S. completes its withdrawal 
<br>from Iraq.  CHOD Basbug will likely repeat the GOT's request 
<br>for laser-designation of targets and/or direct U.S. 
<br>operations against the PKK.  In December, PM Erdogan also 
<br>asked POTUS for 24-hour Predator coverage.  At present we 
<br>provide approximately 12-hour coverage, with an occasional 
<br>surge to 24 hours to support specific Turkish operations, 
<br>such as against High Value Targets.  A move to 24-hour 
<br>coverage is not easy due to resources requirements elsewhere; 
<br>however, we may be able to provide a few weeks of 24-hour 
<br>coverage during crucial spring months, and are working with 
<br>TGS to determine exactly where and when it would be most 
<br>useful to do so, and what assets the Turkish military would 
<br>employ if additional UAV support is made available. 
<br> 
<br>Missile Defense 
<br>---------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (S) The Turks asked us to postpone a return visit from 
<br>Ellen Tauscher, Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and 
<br>International Security, as they are still considering how 
<br>best to respond to our request to base an AN/TPY-2 and 
<br>(potentially) other MD assets in Turkey.  While some of the 
<br>Turks' technical questions remain unanswered, the key 
<br>questions are now political.  During his meeting with 
<br>President Obama, PM Erdogan said that such a system must be 
<br>implemented in a NATO context to diminish the political cost 
<br>that his government will likely bear, both in terms of 
<br>domestic politics and in Turkey's relations with Iran.  The 
<br>ball is now in the court of the civilian leaders here to 
<br>determine just "how much NATO" will be enough for them 
<br>politically; NATOs inability to fund an "interim capability" 
<br>makes it harder for us to show parallel development of a NATO 
<br>BMD system with PAA.  Erdogan is concerned that Turkey's 
<br>participation might later give Israel protection from an 
<br>Iranian counter-strike. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (S) We have made the point to the Turks that a decision to 
<br>not base the AN/TPY-2 radar in Turkey is essentially a 
<br>decision to opt out of missile defense coverage for Turkey; 
<br>this would not be a political consequence, but just a fact 
<br>based on physics and geometry.  It is important to make this 
<br>point again (gently) with PM Erdogan, but also underscore 
<br>that we value Turkey's participation and will try to 
<br>"NATOize" the system, if Turkey will tell us how much NATO 
<br>would be enough. 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (S) Behind all this, we fear, is a manifestation of both 
<br>the Turkish government's, and to some degree the Turkish 
<br>public's, growing distancing from the Atlanticist world view 
<br>now that most dangers for Turkey are gone.  While Turks are 
<br>not naive about Iran (see below), MD places them in a pickle, 
<br>forcing them to choose between the U.S./West and a Middle 
<br>East "vocation" - which, while not necessarily includes 
<br>coddling Iran, requires palpable space between Turkey and 
<br>"the West." 
<br> 
<br>Iran 
<br>---- 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (S) Turkey understands and partially shares U.S. and 
<br>international concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions, but is 
<br>hesitant to use harsh language in public statements, in part 
<br>due to its dependence on Iran as an energy supplier and as a 
<br>trade route to Central Asian markets.  It has worked quietly 
<br>with us to prevent some proliferation-sensitive shipments to 
<br>and from Iran.  Turkey's top civilian and military officials 
<br>may have come to the conclusion that a military strike 
<br>against Iran would be more harmful for Turkey's interests 
<br>than Iran gaining a nuclear weapons capability; they believe 
<br>international pressure against Iran only helps to strengthen 
<br>Ahmadinejad and the hard-liners.  PM Erdogan himself is a 
<br>particularly vocal skeptic of the U.S. position.  However, 
<br>Turkey did press Iran (albeit quietly) to accept the P5 plus 
<br>1 Tehran Research Reactor (TRR) offer and FM Davutoglu had 
<br>been personally engaged in trying to rescue the TRR deal, 
<br>which would have removed a significant portion of Iran's 
<br>lowly-enriched uranium stockpile.  As a current member of the 
<br>UNSC, the Turks would be very hesitant to support sanctions 
<br>against Iran.  We need nevertheless to encourage PM Erdogan 
<br>to support UN actions if Iran does not comply with Iran's 
<br>international obligations while underscoring that we view 
<br>Iran's program as a serious threat to NATO interests in 
<br>Europe and would like to see a non-military solution 
<br>(including Turkish participation in NATO BMD). 
<br> 
<br>Afghanistan/Pakistan 
<br>---------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (SBU) Turkey has been a dedicated partner in Afghanistan. 
<br> It has commanded ISAF twice since its inception and again 
<br>took command of RC-Capital in November. Turkey leads PRT 
<br>Wardak and plans to open a second PRT in Jawzjan (also 
<br>covering Sar-e-Pol) in mid-2010.  Turkey has sponsored the 
<br>"Ankara Process" dialogue, one of several efforts to 
<br>encourage constructive communications between Kabul and 
<br>Islamabad, and is a leading participant in the Friends of 
<br>Democratic Pakistan.  It hosted a trilateral summit on 
<br>January 25 and a Afghanistan Regional Summit (including all 
<br>of Afghanistan's immediate neighbors as well as select other 
<br>countries including the U.S.) on January 26, just prior to 
<br>the January 28 London Conference on Afghanistan. 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (C) Turkey pledged significant aid to both countries: 
<br>USD 200 million to Afghanistan and USD 100 million to 
<br>Pakistan, as well as USD 1.5 million to the ANA.  There are 
<br>1750 Turkish troops in Afghanistan, and Turkey has four OMLTs 
<br>currently in Kabul and, since December, pledged two more 
<br>OMLTs and one POMLT. Because of its culture, history and 
<br>religious orientation, as well as Foreign Minister 
<br>Davutoglu's strategic ambition, Turkey is well disposed to 
<br>act as an agent of the international community's goals in 
<br>Afghanistan and Pakistan.  In 2010, Turkey has pledged to 
<br>offer 6-8 week trainings for up to a brigade's worth of 
<br>Afghan military and police personnel in Turkey and will 
<br>establish a training center in Kabul capable of training up 
<br>to 600 ANSA personnel at a time. 
<br> 
<br>Retrograde through Turkey 
<br>------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (S) Turkey's agreement to allow us to use its territory, 
<br>facilities and airspace has been essential to our ability to 
<br>support operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.  We now look to 
<br>expand current capabilities to transit materiel from Iraq to 
<br>join up with the Northern Distribution Network (NDN) to 
<br>Afghanistan.  CENTCOM logisticians, working with us and our 
<br>EUCOM Office of Defense Cooperation, seek to take advantage 
<br>of improved commercial ties between Turkey and Iraq to move 
<br>non-lethal equipment across Turkey to join the NDN.  We are 
<br>working to expand our current retrograde agreements to 
<br>minimize the time and bureaucracy involved, and to expand 
<br>permissions to allow non-lethal military equipment, including 
<br>armored transport vehicles. 
<br> 
<br>Advocacy for U.S. Defense Industry 
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶13.  (C) We much appreciate SecDef's help in advocating for 
<br>U.S. firms competing for key projects in Turkey, and hope he 
<br>can raise both Sikorsky's and Raytheon's cases in person. 
<br>Sikorsky's "International Blackhawk" proposal holds 
<br>remarkable benefits.  This deal represents a new level of 
<br>industrial partnership; Sikorsky guarantees that it would 
<br>build in Turkey - for sale outside of Turkey - one Blackhawk 
<br>for each one the GOT builds and buys for itself; this is a 
<br>boon of hundreds of millions of dollars for the Turkish 
<br>economy.  On Air Defense, Raytheon's PAC-3 is competing in a 
<br>tender for Turkey's air defense.  Raytheon also seeks to take 
<br>advantage of Turkish industry's ability to co-produce complex 
<br>systems with us and would produce systems for sale in the UAE 
<br>and elsewhere.  The benefit to Turkey's economy from such 
<br>co-production would likely exceed USD 1 billion.  Technically 
<br>and operationally, there is no system which can compete with 
<br>the PAC-3, but Turkey's Defense Ministry seeks to broaden 
<br>competition to include lower-cost options from Russia and 
<br>even from European producers.  Raytheon often asks us to 
<br>remind the Turks that a decision on requests for support on 
<br>Missile Defense should not necessarily affect a decision on 
<br>PAC-3. 
<br> 
<br>UAV's, Attack Helicopters, and Intel Surge 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶14. (C) Turkey seeks to acquire, on an urgent basis, its own 
<br>ISR capability to replace the US assets currently being used 
<br>in anti-PKK operations.  President Obama told PM Erdogan in 
<br>December that we support Turkey's request to acquire armed 
<br>Reaper UAVs.  Nevertheless, approval for armed Reapers is 
<br>complicated due to Hill concerns.  We have explained this to 
<br>the Turks.  However, even if those could be overcome, the 
<br>delivery pipeline for these systems is long, and Turkey's 
<br>leaders have sought reassurance that we will not pull our 
<br>intelligence support until they can replace it.  While we are 
<br>working to enhance Turkey's ISR capabilities, we have not 
<br>made this commitment to date. 
<br> 
<br>¶15. (C) Bad GOT procurement decisions led Turkey to a severe 
<br>shortage of dual engine, high altitude attack helicopters, 
<br>which it desperately needs to fight the PKK.  PM Erdogan 
<br>raised this issue with the President in December 2009; SecDef 
<br>should expect this issue to be a top priority in meetings 
<br>with Minister Gonul and with GEN Basbug.  The Turks took 
<br>SecDef's May 2009 letter to provide up to four AH-1W 
<br>helicopters each in 2011, 2012 and 2013 as a firm commitment, 
<br>and now have asked us to advance that date to 2010.  They do 
<br>not accept our explanation that these aircraft are simply not 
<br>available from our inventory, as they believe they have -- 
<br>just like the U.S. -- "troops in contact" and need the close 
<br>tactical support.  While SecDef should make no commitment, we 
<br>should also explore whether we can persuade Taiwan to sell or 
<br>lease some of its own AH-1W aircraft now that Taiwan is 
<br>taking delivery of Apaches. 
<br> 
<br>Support For The US-Turkey-Iraq "Tripartite Security Dialogue" 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶16. (S) SecDef's visit will take place just as USFI's GEN 
<br>Odierno will have left.  We expect that GEN Odierno's visit 
<br>will give a political boost to the U.S.-Turkey-Iraq 
<br>Tripartite Security talks.  Turkey's civilian leaders are 
<br>taking heat from their domestic political opposition for 
<br>pressing the "Kurdish Opening" while casualties from PKK 
<br>attacks continue.  They hope to use GEN Odierno's visit to 
<br>show that their whole-of-government approach against PKK 
<br>insurgency is producing results and that it has the support 
<br>of senior USG officials in Iraq. 
<br> 
<br>¶17.  (S) Trilateral meetings continue regularly and a new 
<br>Tripartite operational office in Erbil, established to share 
<br>counter-PKK intelligence was established over the summer. 
<br>The most recent tri-lat meeting took place in Baghdad in 
<br>December, followed by a joint Turkey-Iraq visit in Erbil. 
<br>The Turks remain frustrated that, in their view, the KRG is 
<br>not doing enough to combat the PKK.  The Turks remain shy in 
<br>sharing intelligence data; they are not convinced that they 
<br> 
<br>can trust Iraqi/Kurdish individuals to keep information 
<br>concerning operations secret.  Turkish officials have become 
<br>more strident in their calls for KRG officials to take action 
<br>against the PKK. The cooperation that does exist is a step in 
<br>the right direction; however, it will need to improve 
<br>significantly prior to the U.S. pullout of Iraq.  CHOD Basbug 
<br>and PM Ergodan want the U.S. to put more pressure on the 
<br>Iraqis - and particularly Masoud Barzani - to take actions to 
<br>cut PKK supply and logistics lines in northern Iraq.  We 
<br>should stress the need for more trust and collaboration 
<br>between Turkey and Iraq, eventually on Turkish CBOs.  Absent 
<br>greater cooperation, we could see significant bilateral 
<br>problems post-2011, to include Iraqi claims of Turkey's 
<br>violation of its sovereign territory. 
<br> 
<br>Northern Iraq 
<br>-------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶18. (C) Turkey will not consider any alternative to the 
<br>political unity and territorial integrity of Iraq, but has 
<br>become more flexible on how it engages "the local authorities 
<br>of northern Iraq" (how Turkey refers officially to the 
<br>Kurdish Regional Government (KRG)).  Turkey's policy remains 
<br>focused on the government in Baghdad, but its outreach to the 
<br>KRG is expanding.  This outreach is reinforced by the 
<br>continued dominance of Turkish products and investments in 
<br>the KRG's healthy economy. 
<br> 
<br>Armenia 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶19. (S) The signing of the Protocols to reestablish 
<br>Turkish-Armenian relations and open the common border in 
<br>Zurich on October 10 was a landmark for the region.  However, 
<br>neither Turkey nor Armenia have taken steps toward 
<br>ratification; the GOT argues that progress toward withdrawal 
<br>of Armenian forces from Azerbaijani provinces surrounding 
<br>Nagorno-Karabakh is a pre-condition.  (Note:  This was 
<br>not/not part of the agreement, and not a position the U.S. 
<br>supports.  End note.)  Future relations will nevertheless 
<br>still be heavily linked to the 1915 "Armenian genocide" 
<br>issue.  Any U.S. determination of the events of 1915 as 
<br>"genocide" would set off a political firestorm in Turkey, and 
<br>the effect on our bilateral relationship -- including 
<br>political, military, and commercial aspects -- would be 
<br>devastating. 
<br> 
<br>Israel 
<br>------ 
<br> 
<br>¶20. (C) While the Foreign Ministry and the Turkish General 
<br>Staff agree with us that a strong Turkey-Israel relationship 
<br>is essential for regional stability, PM Erdogan has sought to 
<br>shore up his domestic right flank through continued populist 
<br>rhetoric against Israel and its December 2008 Gaza operation. 
<br> His outburst at Davos and the last-minute cancellation of 
<br>Israel's participation in the Fall 2009 Anatolian Eagle 
<br>Exercise (a multilateral Air Force exercise which had US, 
<br>Turkey, Italy, and Israel as planned participants) were the 
<br>most noticeable examples of this rhetoric, which we and his 
<br>staff have sought to contain.  The latest incident, a snub in 
<br>early January of the Turkish Ambassador by Israeli Deputy 
<br>Foreign Minster Danny Ayalon, almost caused the GOT to both 
<br>recall its Ambassador and cancel the visit of Israeli Defense 
<br>Minister Ehud Barak.  However, the very public row was 
<br>resolved with an Israeli apology and Barak's visit on January 
<br>17 helped to stem the downward spiral for now.  Nevertheless, 
<br>we assess that Erdogan is likely to continue anti-Israel 
<br>remarks and the issues will continue to cast a shadow on the 
<br>TU-IS bilateral relationship. 
<br> 
<br>Political Environment 
<br>--------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶21. (C) PM Erdogan's Islamist-leaning Justice and Development 
<br>(AK) Party remains Turkey's strongest political party,  but 
<br>its poll numbers are slumping, and it continues to fear an 
<br>erosion of its political base from more conservative/Islamist 
<br> 
<br>parties.  Civilian-military relations remain complex.  Chief 
<br>of Staff General Basbug has worked out a modus vivendi with 
<br>PM Erdogan, but the long-running struggle between Turkey's 
<br>secularists (with the Army as its champion) and Islamists 
<br>(represented by the government) naturally puts them at odds. 
<br>Erdogan has the clear upper hand, a fact with which Basbug 
<br>has seemingly learned to live.  Alleged past military 
<br>involvement in coup contingency planning or even deliberate 
<br>generation of internal chaos remains political theme number 
<br>one and preoccupies both Erdogan and Basbug and their 
<br>respective underlings.  Public trust in the military is 
<br>starting to decline, the result of several very public 
<br>on-going investigations into the alleged planning against the 
<br>government.
