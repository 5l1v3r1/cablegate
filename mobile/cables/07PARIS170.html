<br>1.4 (B) AND (D). 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (S)  LE MONDE'S JAN. 17 EDITION RAN A FRONT-PAGE STORY ON 
<br>CHIRAC,S INTEREST IN PURSUING A DIALOGUE WITH IRAN ON 
<br>LEBANON, THUS CONFIRMING WHAT MFA POLITICAL DIRECTOR GERARD 
<br>ARAUD TOLD THE AMBASSADOR DURING THEIR JAN. 15 MEETING.  WE 
<br>FACE THE PROSPECT OF UNTOWARD POLICY INITIATIVES BY CHIRAC 
<br>DURING THE WANING MONTHS OF HIS PRESIDENCY.  (THE FIRST ROUND 
<br>OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WILL BE HELD APRIL 22; IT IS 
<br>WIDELY ASSUMED THAT CHIRAC WILL NOT BE IN A POSITION TO RUN 
<br>FOR A THIRD TERM.)  WE MAY HAVE ENTERED A PERIOD IN WHICH THE 
<br>DOMESTIC POLITICAL CONTEXT WILL IMPACT DIRECTLY ON FOREIGN 
<br>POLICY DECISIONS, PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO LEBANON AND 
<br>IRAN. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S)  FIRST OF ALL THE FACTS, AS WE KNOW THEM AND AS 
<br>CONVEYED TO AMBASSADOR STAPLETON BY ARAUD.  CHIRAC FAVORED 
<br>ENLISTING IRAN IN AN EFFORT TO BREAK THE STALEMATE IN 
<br>LEBANON.  TO THIS END, THE PRESIDENCY PROPOSED SENDING 
<br>FOREIGN MINISTER DOUSTE-BLAZY TO TEHRAN TO SOUND OUT THE 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>PAGE 03 RUEHFRA0170 S E C R E T 
<br>IRANIANS ON THEIR PLAYING A CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE IN LEBANON -- 
<br>WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE NUCLEAR ISSUE.  THE FOREIGN 
<br>MINISTRY, UNCONVINCED THAT THERE WOULD BE ANY IRANIAN 
<br>INTEREST, AND CONCERNED ABOUT APPROACHING IRAN AS A 
<br>DEMANDEUR, OPPOSED THE INITIATIVE.  SAUDI ARABIA AND EGYPT 
<br>BOTH VOICED STRENUOUS OBJECTIONS.  U/S BURNS RAISED USG 
<br>CONCERNS DIRECTLY WITH ARAUD.  THE ELYSEE THEREFORE BACKED 
<br>OFF "FOR NOW" ACCORDING TO THE MFA SPOKESMAN YESTERDAY. 
<br>WHILE ARAUD DID NOT MENTION THE POSSIBILITY OF A VISIT TO 
<br>TEHRAN BY A LOWER-RANKING ENVOY, LE MONDE HINTED THAT MIDDLE 
<br>EAST TROUBLE-SHOOTER JEAN-CLAUDE COUSSERAN, WHO VISITED THE 
<br>IRANIAN CAPITAL IN JULY, DURING THE ISRAEL/HIZBALLAH WAR, 
<br>COULD BE DISPATCHED AGAIN IN THE NEAR FUTURE. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S)  REPORTING IN OTHER CHANNELS INDICATES THIS IS INDEED 
<br>POSSIBLE.  THE DECISION NOT TO SEND DOUSTE-BLAZY COULD WELL 
<br>BE DEFINITIVE.  EVEN IF A LOWER-LEVEL EMISSARY IS SENT TO 
<br>TEHRAN, THE MAKINGS OF A DEAL ON LEBANON ARE NOT OBVIOUS. 
<br>HOWEVER, THIS EPISODE HAS HIGHLIGHTED A NUMBER OF CONTEXTUAL 
<br>FACTORS AND HYPOTHESES THAT GIVE RISE TO A FEW CONCERNS. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>PAGE 04 RUEHFRA0170 S E C R E T 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (S)  THE FIRST IS THAT THE DISTORTING EFFECT OF CHIRAC,S 
<br>"OBSESSION WITH LEBANON" (ARAUD,S WORDS) MIGHT ONLY BE 
<br>FURTHER ACCENTUATED AS HIS PRESIDENCY DRAWS TO A CLOSE. 
<br>CHIRAC,S FOCUS COULD BE NARROWING IN ON ONE SINGLE 
<br>OBJECTIVE: TO ENSURE THAT THE SYRIAN REGIME, WHICH HE REGARDS 
<br>AS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF RAFIK HARIRI, DOES 
<br>NOT GAIN A NEW FOOTHOLD IN LEBANON.  THIS COULD TRANSLATE 
<br>INTO A WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH IRAN TO FIND SOME SORT OF 
<br>ACCOMMODATION WHICH STRENGTHENS HIZBOLLAH IN LEBANON, BUT 
<br>PREVENTS THE STRATEGIC RETURN OF SYRIA.  NO MFA OR ELYSEE 
<br>INTERLOCUTOR HAS POINTED US TO SUCH A CONCLUSION, BUT WE ARE 
<br>LEFT WITH FEW OTHER EXPLANATIONS FOR CHIRAC'S APPARENT 
<br>DETERMINATION TO REACH OUT AT THIS TIME TO HIZBOLLAH,S MAIN 
<br>REGIONAL SPONSOR. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (S)  MOREOVER, THIS ANALYSIS IS CONSISTENT WITH OTHER 
<br>INDICATIONS OF LATE THAT FRANCE IS FIXATED ON LOWERING 
<br>TENSIONS IN LEBANON.  THESE INCLUDE, INTER ALIA: THE 
<br>RELUCTANCE (THUS FAR) TO OPERATE FRENCH UAVS OVER SOUTHERN 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>PAGE 05 RUEHFRA0170 S E C R E T 
<br>LEBANON; THE MFA'S DECISION IN LATE DECEMBER TO "TAKE A 
<br>BREAK" FROM PUSHING FOR THE RAPID ESTABLISHMENT OF THE 
<br>INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL FOR LEBANON; AND THE FACT THAT MFA 
<br>DESK OFFICERS ARE CAREFULLY SCRUBBING PRESIDENT CHIRAC'S 
<br>PROPOSED INTERVENTION AT THE JANUARY 25 LEBANON CONFERENCE TO 
<br>ENSURE THAT THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE DOES NOT ANTAGONIZE THE 
<br>LEBANESE OPPOSITION.  IN ADDITION, CHIRACS NEW-FOUND CAUTION 
<br>ON LEBANON AND HIS PROPOSED OVERTURE TO IRAN MAY BOTH REFLECT 
<br>THE FRENCH PRESIDENT'S FEAR OF INCURRING FRENCH CASUALTIES IN 
<br>LEBANON IN THE FINAL MONTHS OF HIS PRESIDENCY. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (S)  ANOTHER CONCERN RELATES TO CHIRAC,S FOREIGN POLICY 
<br>LEGACY, WHICH HINGES SIGNIFICANTLY ON TWO ACHIEVEMENTS, HIS 
<br>LEADERSHIP IN OPPOSING THE U.S. OVER IRAQ, AND IN RESTORING 
<br>LEBANON,S INDEPENDENCE.  THE LE MONDE REPORT WHICH BROKE THE 
<br>NEWS OF THE ABORTED DOUSTE-BLAZY MISSION CLOSES WITH 
<br>SPECULATION THAT CHIRAC IS INCREASINGLY ALARMED BY U.S. 
<br>INTENTIONS VIS A VIS IRAN.  CHIRAC COULD BE TEMPTED BY POLICY 
<br>INITIATIVES THAT SERVE TO BOLSTER HIS LEGACY ON BOTH COUNTS: 
<br>PROTECTING LEBANON,S INDEPENDENCE WHILE AT THE SAME TIME 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>PAGE 06 RUEHFRA0170 S E C R E T 
<br>STANDING STRONG AGAINST ANY PERCEIVED DANGEROUS DRIFT IN U.S. 
<br>MIDDLE EAST POLICY, A REPRISE IN GENTLER FORM OF THE GLORY 
<br>DAYS OF 2003. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (S)  FINALLY, CONVENTIONAL WISDOM HERE HAS IT THAT THE 
<br>ONLY CONCEIVABLE SCENARIO WHEREBY CHIRAC COULD BECOME A 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>VIABLE CANDIDATE TO SUCCEED WOULD BE IN THE CONTEXT OF AN 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>PAGE 02 RUEHFRA0170 S E C R E T 
<br>INTERNATIONAL CRISIS.  MIGHT CHIRAC BE POSITIONING HIMSELF TO 
<br>TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AN IRAN-CENTERED CRISIS THAT WOULD OFFER 
<br>HIS ONLY TICKET BACK TO THE ELYSEE? 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (S)  CHIRAC MAY CHOOSE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH HIS ENVOY IDEA 
<br>BEFORE WE CAN GET FULL CLARIFICATION.  IF HE DOES, IT SEEMS 
<br>OBVIOUS (TO US AND TO MANY WITHIN THE FRENCH FOREIGN POLICY 
<br>ESTABLISHMENT) THAT THE IRANIANS WILL SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY 
<br>TO ADVANCE THEIR OWN AGENDA IN LEBANON WHILE TRYING TO DRIVE 
<br>A WEDGE BETWEEN FRANCE AND THE REST OF THE INTERNATIONAL 
<br>COMMUNITY WITH RESPECT TO IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM.  WE WILL 
<br>TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR INTERACTIONS WITH SENIOR FRENCH LEADERS 
<br>OVER THE COMING DAYS TO MAKE CLEAR OUR CONCERNS, AS WE ASSUME 
<br>WASHINGTON AGENCIES WILL DO AS WELL.  HAVING NOTED THE 
<br>COALITION RAID ON THE IRANIAN OFFICE IN IRBIL, THE DEPLOYMENT 
<br>OF A NEW CARRIER BATTLE GROUP TO THE PERSIAN GULF, AND RECENT 
<br>STATEMENTS ON IRAN BY SECDEF GATES AND OTHERS, THE FRENCH ARE 
<br>AWARE OF THE GROWING PRESSURE ON TEHRAN.  MAINTAINING OUR 
<br>FULL AND FRANK EXCHANGES WITH THE FRENCH ON IRAN WILL BE 
<br>PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN THE COMING DAYS.
