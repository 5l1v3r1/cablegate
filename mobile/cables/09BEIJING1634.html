<br>SUBJECT: CDA AND MFA ASIAN AFFAIRS ON DPRK
<br>
<br>Classified By: Charge d'Affaires, a.i., Dan Piccuta.   Reasons 1.4 (b/d
<br>).
<br>
<br>Summary
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) In a June 16 luncheon in honor of visiting Hong Kong
<br>CG Joe Donovan hosted by the Charge, XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX said that
<br>China liked a U.S. proposal described by Ambassador Bosworth
<br>here on June 5 to put all issues related to the
<br>denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula into a package for
<br>negotiation.  XXXXXXXXXXXX maintained that the United States holds the
<br>key to bringing the DPRK back to the negotiation table and
<br>suggested that succession concerns in North Korea might be
<br>causing Kim Jong-il to escalate tensions with the United
<br>States so that his successor, perhaps Kim Jong-un, could then
<br>step in to ease pressure.  XXXXXXXXXXXX acknowledged that China experts
<br>believe the DPRK has been processing highly enriched uranium
<br>but asserted that the program was only in an initial phase.
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX suggested that ROK envoy to the Six-Party Talks had not
<br>offered any new ideas during his June 9 visit to Beijing and
<br>that Japan's focus on the abductee issue continued to cause
<br>concerns at the MFA.  End Summary.
<br>
<br>Chinese Protests to DPRK Have Had No Effect
<br>-------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2.  (C) In a June 16 luncheon hosted by the Charge, XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX made
<br>clear that the PRC viewed recent provocative actions by the
<br>DPRK as having gone too far.  He assured the Charge that
<br>Chinese officials had expressed Chinese displeasure to North
<br>Korean counterparts and had pressed the DPRK to return to the
<br>negotiation table.  Unfortunately, XXXXXXXXXXXX added, those protests
<br>had had "no effect."  "The only country that can make
<br>progress with the North Koreans is the United States," he
<br>maintained.  XXXXXXXXXXXX said that, although China had assured North
<br>Korean leaders that the United States was ready to have
<br>bilateral talks with them, the North Koreans had insisted
<br>that any message from the United States to the DPRK should be
<br>delivered directly, not through China.  XXXXXXXXXXXX took this as
<br>further evidence that only by having direct talks with the
<br>United States would North Korea return to the Six-Party
<br>Talks.
<br>
<br>China Likes a Package Approach
<br>------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶3.  (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX told the Charge that China viewed favorably the
<br>USG proposal of putting all facets of a possible Korean
<br>Peninsula denuclearization agreement into one package.  XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>characterized Chinese and U.S. core interests in a nuclear
<br>free Korean Peninsula as "shared."  He reminded his hosts
<br>that Punggye, the site of the DPRK nuclear test, was near the
<br>Chinese border and that any accident there could have had
<br>dire consequences for Northeast China.  XXXXXXXXXXXX insisted that
<br>China was as concerned as the United States about
<br>proliferation from North Korea.  The only difference in the
<br>China and U.S. positions, XXXXXXXXXXXX maintained, was "the United
<br>States was the key while China was only in a position to
<br>apply a little oil to the lock."
<br>
<br>Building Trust
<br>--------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX cautioned that building trust between the DPRK and
<br>the United States would be difficult.  In North Korea's view,
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX explained, the destruction of its nuclear capability was
<br>an irreversible step while decisions by the United States
<br>could be easily reversed.  When CGs Donovan and Goldberg both
<br>pointed out that trust was a two-way street and that North
<br>Korea had not evinced a great deal of it, XXXXXXXXXXXX was evasive.
<br>When pressed whether he believed the DPRK had been
<br>reprocessing highly enriched uranium (HEU), XXXXXXXXXXXX said yes,
<br>adding that Chinese experts believed the enrichment was only
<br>in its initial phases and that any DPRK HEU program would not
<br>be "very useful."
<br>
<br>Domestic Concerns in North Korea Influence Talks
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX suggested that domestic politics in North Korea
<br>were in a large way responsible for Pyongyang's recent
<br>actions.  He was dismissive of DPRK justifications for the
<br>nuclear test as a response to the UN Security Council
<br>
<br>BEIJING 00001634  002 OF 002
<br>
<br>Presidential Statement critical of North Korea's April 5
<br>Taepo-Dong 2 launch.  "Kim Jong-il was obviously planning the
<br>nuclear test at the same time as the missile launch so his
<br>justification for the test makes no sense," XXXXXXXXXXXX said.  XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>opined that the rapid pace of provocative actions in North
<br>Korea was due to Kim Jong-il's declining health and might be
<br>part of a gambit under which Kim Jong-il would escalate
<br>tensions with the United States so that his successor,
<br>presumably Kim Jong-un, could then step in and ease those
<br>tensions.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX told the Charge that he
<br>kept abreast of Western media reports about North Korea.
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX cautioned that U.S. experts should not assume North
<br>Korea would implode after Kim Jong-il's death.  He said that
<br>PRC analysts concluded that the regime would still function
<br>normally and discounted strongly any suggestion that the
<br>system would collapse once Kim Jong-il disappeared.
<br>
<br>ROK has no new ideas - Japan can only scuttle talks
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------
<br>
<br>¶7.  (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX said that ROK Six-Party Talks envoy Wi Sung-lac
<br>had met with VFM Wu Dawei on June 9 but had offered nothing
<br>new.  "The South Koreans have plenty of ideas, but we've
<br>heard them all before," he complained, adding that the ROK
<br>government was too close to the situation in North Korea to
<br>be objective.   Turning to Japan, XXXXXXXXXXXX said that Japan's
<br>obsession with the abductee issue reminded him of a Chinese
<br>expression for an individual who was too weak to make
<br>something work, yet strong enough to destroy it.
