<br>
<br>------- 
<br>Summary 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S//NF) Manifest in the public rhetoric of both 
<br>countries, a shared hatred for the USG is the driving factor 
<br>in the budding relationship between Iran and Venezuela. The 
<br>BRV is favoring Iran with petroleum deals and other contracts 
<br>that appear to make little commercial sense. Although rumors 
<br>of Venezuela's cooperation with an Iranian nuclear weapons 
<br>program appear baseless, Iran and Venezuelan spokesmen have 
<br>announced their intention to develop Venezuela's civilian 
<br>nuclear capabilities. Press reports and Embassy contacts 
<br>suggest Venezuela is preparing to try to exploit its own 
<br>uranium deposits with Iran's assistance. Sensitive reporting 
<br>indicates Venezuela may also be seeking armaments, 
<br>cooperation on maintaining aircraft purchased from the United 
<br>States, and help in training its military reserves. Post 
<br>will continue to monitor the relationship while seeking to 
<br>exploit Venezuela's missteps as it isolates itself from 
<br>countries alarmed about Iran's nuclear ambitions. End 
<br>summary. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) Iran and Venezuela have been signing bilateral 
<br>agreements galore. Iranian parliamentary speaker Gholam-Ali 
<br>Haddad Adel told the press during his visit to Caracas in 
<br>mid-February that the two countries had signed 100 accords. 
<br>Iranian President Mohammad Khatami and Venezuelan President 
<br>Hugo Chavez inked twenty of these together in March 2005, 
<br>including plans to cooperate in petrochemical, agricultural, 
<br>and housing projects. Venezuela often signs agreements to 
<br>show off its importance on the world stage without following 
<br>through. Yet, in the case of Iran, there appears to be more 
<br>to the budding relationship than show. Below we examine 
<br>several possible explanations for the bilateral coziness, in 
<br>rough order of importance. 
<br>
<br>-------- 
<br>Ideology 
<br>-------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) Iran shares a disdain for the U.S. Government that 
<br>the BRV seeks in its foreign allies. Chavez' ill-defined, 
<br>left-wing, anti-American ideology often drives his foreign 
<br>policy decisions, even when his foreign counterparts only 
<br>appear to be seeking commercial benefits. With Iran, 
<br>however, he has found a partner that shares his desire to try 
<br>to face down the United States. Evident in his daily 
<br>rhetoric, Chavez' ideology--and his accompanying attempts to 
<br>use it to stir up his political base--best explain his 
<br>decision to isolate himself from much of the world by 
<br>supporting Iran. (Venezuela joined only Syria and Cuba in 
<br>voting February 4 to oppose Iran's referral to the U.N. 
<br>Security Council for its involvement in uranium enrichment.) 
<br>Chavez, who regularly alleges the U.S. military has stolen 
<br>Iraq's oil, has accused Washington of having designs on 
<br>Iran's supply. Other BRV officials have taken Chavez' 
<br>ideological cue to the point of making Venezuela appear 
<br>
<br>CARACAS 00000958 002.2 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>fanatical. General Alberto Muller, a key proponent and 
<br>planner of Venezuela's new military doctrine, announced 
<br>February 14 that Iran would be acting "in legitimate defense" 
<br>if it were to use nuclear arms, although he cautioned that 
<br>Venezuela did not support the production of such weapons. 
<br>According to Argentine newspaper La Nacion, Venezuelan 
<br>Ambassador to Argentina Roger Capella Mateo stormed out of a 
<br>Mercosur meeting with Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel 
<br>Moratinos when Moratinos said his country opposed Iran's 
<br>refusal to submit to nuclear controls. 
<br>
<br>--------- 
<br>Petroleum 
<br>--------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Ideology may be the only explanation for bilateral 
<br>cooperation in the petroleum sector. Iran and Venezuela 
<br>appear to enjoy each other's company as fellow radical 
<br>oil-producing countries. Both Iran and Venezuela are OPEC 
<br>price hawks, but their solidarity on the supply issue does 
<br>not appear to have translated into many mutual benefits. 
<br>Foreign Minister Ali Rodriguez told reporters March 11 that 
<br>Iran and Venezuela were signing agreements because their oil 
<br>policies coincided, but mentioned nothing tangible, 
<br>digressing into how Venezuela could benefit from Iranian 
<br>experience in the cooperative movement and in developing 
<br>small agricultural machines. Venezuela has granted the 
<br>Iranian company Petropars the rights to certify a block in 
<br>the Faja region. The Iranians, however, have no experience 
<br>exploiting the extra heavy crude found in the area. (The 
<br>industry perception is that if a company is granted rights to 
<br>study a block in the Faja, it will eventually be given a 
<br>block in the area to exploit.) Chevron representatives told 
<br>us that the Iranians approached them seeking assistance on 
<br>carrying out the certification studies. 
<br>
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br>Commercial Agreements: Who's to Gain? 
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) A USD 200 million binational fund to finance 
<br>investment in both countries could ensure that commercial 
<br>ties continue to grow. Nonetheless, the unprofitability of 
<br>many of the deals inked with Iran again raises the question 
<br>of whether ideological factors are driving the relationship. 
<br>For example, in January Venezuela offered Iran contracts to 
<br>build low-income housing even though Iran's bid was twice as 
<br>expensive as the Venezuelan private sector's. (Note: 
<br>corruption could explain the overpricing, as well.) 
<br>Venezuela also plans to build a USD 220 million cement plant 
<br>to supply the local market with Iran's help. Such a plant 
<br>would appear to be a poor investment. Despite the enormous 
<br>transportation costs for cement, multinational CEMEX 
<br>currently exports cement from Venezuela for a price lower 
<br>than the going Venezuela rate because its local buyers delay 
<br>payments, according to a prominent economic contact. Chavez 
<br>announced in February he would import 10 Iranian plants to 
<br>process corn flour, a Venezuelan staple. The BRV likely sees 
<br>the state takeover of this industry as a solution to recent 
<br>shortages caused by its price controls. In another example 
<br>of state economic planning and ideological ties trumping 
<br>sound investment planning, Iran will establish an ethanol 
<br>plant in Lara State, according to press reports. The BRV may 
<br>view the production of ethanol--a by-product of sugar 
<br>refinery--as a fringe benefit to its project to resurrect 
<br>failed Cuban sugar mills in Venezuela. 
<br>

<br>Going Nuclear?: Uranium Rumors and More 
<br>
<br>CARACAS 00000958 003.2 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) As reported REF A, recent rumors that Venezuela is 
<br>trafficking in nuclear weapons and mining uranium for Iran 
<br>appear to be little more than the conspiracy-mongering by 
<br>Chavez adversaries. More disconcerting, however, are BRV and 
<br>GOI statements that suggest a long-term plan to develop 
<br>Venezuela's nuclear potential. Chavez mentioned on his 
<br>weekly "Alo Presidente" program in May 2005 the possibility 
<br>of asking help from "countries like Iran" in developing a 
<br>nuclear energy program. In February 2006, Iran publicly 
<br>affirmed its willingness to help Venezuela develop nuclear 
<br>energy, according to press reports. (See REF B for a 
<br>description of Venezuela's need for foreign expertise to 
<br>restart the fledgling nuclear program it shut down in the 
<br>1980s.) In March 2005, a memorandum of understanding signed 
<br>by the Iranian and Venezuelan Presidents established that 
<br>Iran would help Venezuela create a "National Geoscience 
<br>Database" that would contain a survey of the mineral deposits 
<br>throughout Venezuelan territory. Tomasso Tosini, geologist 
<br>and director of the Earth Sciences Institute of the Central 
<br>University of Venezuela, told us in June 2005 that creating 
<br>such a "basic geological map" of Venezuela would be the 
<br>logical first step to restarting a uranium program in 
<br>Venezuela. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) During a February 2006 meeting with poloff, UCV 
<br>professor and senior Accion Democratica party official Nelson 
<br>Lara claimed to have information substantiating Iran's 
<br>involvement in Venezuela's mineral sector. Lara said active 
<br>duty military officers in his classes told him that 20 
<br>Iranian officials were working in the Ministry of Basic 
<br>Industry and Mines. He said the Iranians did not answer to 
<br>any Venezuelan management. Lara speculated about their 
<br>involvement in uranium mining but said he did not know the 
<br>Iranians' role in the ministry. He added that 37 Iranians 
<br>were active in the Venezuelan Institute of Geology and Mines, 
<br>which Chavez launched in mid-2004. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Venezuelan threats to take over property in areas 
<br>believed to have significant radioactive deposits are fueling 
<br>additional rumors that Venezuela is planning to mine 
<br>uranium. (Embassy note: Rumors that the BRV is planning to 
<br>mine these areas appear overblown. Factors besides uranium 
<br>are driving the government's targeting of land, although the 
<br>delays in expropriations reported in REF C could also reflect 
<br>BRV attempts to drag out negotiations for land until it can 
<br>gauge the true value of properties' mineral wealth.) In the 
<br>mid-1980s, the Ministry of Energy and Mines conducted 
<br>preliminary geochemical samplings that indicated the possible 
<br>presence of uranium deposits in at least two locations 
<br>currently eyed by the government: 
<br>
<br>-- The study revealed "anomalous areas to be assessed in 
<br>more detail" along the Caroni River in Bolivar State, where 
<br>the National Guard has begun evicting individual gold and 
<br>diamond prospectors reportedly to prevent them from damaging 
<br>the environment. In mid-March, National Guard attempts to 
<br>dislodge people from the Caroni basin ended in the deaths of 
<br>two miners. Demanding the withdrawal of soldiers stationed 
<br>in the Venezuelan military's fifth theater of operations 
<br>(TO5), miners responded by blocking roads and burning TO5 
<br>facilities. 
<br>
<br>-- The ministry report cited a section of Cojedes State as a 
<br>source of concentrated uranium. The area contains ranch and 
<br>nature preserve Hato Pinero, which the government has 
<br>targeted for possible expropriation. Concerned that the 
<br>ranch's alleged mineral wealth might attract BRV interest, 
<br>
<br>CARACAS 00000958 004.2 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>ranch owner Jaime Perez Branger gave us a copy of an earlier 
<br>(1959) Ministry of Mines report calling Pinero's granite "the 
<br>most radioactive in the region." A footnote in the document, 
<br>however, noted that the counters used in the 1959 study would 
<br>not have detected uranium ore, one of many possible sources 
<br>of radioactivity. 
<br>
<br>------- 
<br>Defense 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S//NF) Defense cooperation may also help explain the 
<br>expansion of the bilateral relationship (REFS D and E). 
<br>Indeed, an army official is scheduled to replace the current 
<br>Iranian Ambassador to Venezuela. According to sensitive 
<br>reporting, the Venezuelan Government is seeking lethal 
<br>armament from Iran such as rockets and other explosive 
<br>materiel. Venezuela has also sought from Iran parts for the 
<br>U.S. aircraft in its fleet that have been denied under the 
<br>Department's policy prohibiting the sale of components for 
<br>lethal munitions. Finally, sensitive reporting suggests that 
<br>Venezuela has sought help from Iran in establishing its 
<br>military reserve force. The Iranian popular mobilization 
<br>army (Basij) and the revolutionary guard corps (IRGC) invite 
<br>comparison with Venezuela's still evolving parallel military 
<br>structures: the reserves and the territorial guard. 
<br>Commander of the Basij Gen. Mohammed Hejazi visited Venezuela 
<br>in 2005, and an IRGC colonel has arrived here probably on 
<br>permanent assignment. A retired military officer citing 
<br>Venezuelan reservists told us March 24 that Iran had a small 
<br>number of soldiers in Venezuela training the reserves. 
<br>
<br>--------------- 
<br>Shared Culture? 
<br>--------------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (S//NF) Venezuela has a Muslim population of about 
<br>250,000 including some tens of thousands of Shia'. In 
<br>addition to its political activities, the nine 
<br>Iranians--including four career diplomats--posted to the 
<br>Iranian Embassy in Venezuela represent a small but growing 
<br>number of their citizens working in Venezuela in both the 
<br>formal and informal sectors. Cultural ties between the two 
<br>countries, however, do little to help explain the expanding 
<br>relationship. Most Venezuelans are unfamiliar with Muslims 
<br>and are unable to distinguish Iranians from Arabs or from 
<br>other Muslims. Indeed, as REF F states about Iran and Cuba, 
<br>Venezuelan and Iranian societies have little more in common 
<br>than their despotic leaders' antipathy toward the United 
<br>States. 
<br>
<br>------- 
<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Venezuela's support for a country that has nuclear 
<br>ambitions, supports terrorism, and talks about wiping Israel 
<br>off the map is of grave concern. It also alarms 
<br>nations--such as France (REF G)--that have tended to make 
<br>light of our concerns about Venezuela's antidemocratic 
<br>tendencies and militarization. We can exploit this alarm. 
<br>Just as the shared animosity toward Washington driving the 
<br>Iran-Venezuela relationship leads to irrational commercial 
<br>endeavors, it is also likely to lead to additional diplomatic 
<br>gaffes and other missteps that reflect poorly on the BRV 
<br>among wary international observers. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) We should not dismiss the uranium rumors. At the 
<br>very least, it appears clear Venezuela plans to prospect for 
<br>
<br>CARACAS 00000958 005.2 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>uranium with the intention of starting a nuclear program. 
<br>Like many BRV schemes, the plan may remain in bureaucratic 
<br>and financial limbo for years, and it may never be 
<br>fulfilled. Yet, in the event that its ends are not peaceful, 
<br>it warrants careful monitoring. All source information 
<br>indicates Iran needs foreign sources of uranium to maintain 
<br>its nuclear program. How Iran would benefit from any 
<br>Venezuelan plan to extract uranium will be an open question 
<br>as long as Venezuela's uranium deposits remain unverified.
