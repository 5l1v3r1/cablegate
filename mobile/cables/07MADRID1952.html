<br>
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) On October 9, Foreign Ministry Deputy Director for
<br>North American Affairs Fernando Prieto presented a nonpaper
<br>to desk officer Elaine Samson and EconOff reinforcing the
<br>GOS' desire to obtain broader access to the Odyssey import
<br>documents into the U.S. and requesting that the U.S. conduct
<br>an investigation of potential violations of U.S. law on the
<br>part of Odyssey Marine Exploration company.
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) The text of the message, which was presented in
<br>English, is as follows:
<br>
<br>Further to the meetings of 27 September 2007 and 3rd October
<br>2007 with Mr. Bellinger, Legal Advisor, U.S. Department of
<br>State, here is a reply to the points raised by him on the two
<br>Spanish requests included in the Non Paper dated 24th
<br>September 2007.
<br>
<br>Request A: That the documents presented by Odyssey Marine
<br>Exploration (OME) for entry into the U.S. of certain
<br>archaeological goods be released for confidential use.
<br>
<br>¶1. Release of the documents is requested for
<br>confidential use in investigation of potential violations of
<br>
<br>SIPDIS
<br>application U.S. Customs and Spanish laws concerning the
<br>extraction and shipment of these goods, and in judicial
<br>proceedings that may arise from enforcement of the relevant
<br>United States and Spanish Laws.
<br>
<br>¶2. Additionally, there is reason to believe that the
<br>materials imported by OME are property of the Kingdom of
<br>Spain taken from the sea and imported to the U.S. in
<br>violation of Spanish law. The importation of these materials
<br>may accordingly be subject to U.S. Customs laws as materials
<br>imported contrary to relevant U.S. and Spanish law concerning
<br>the protection of national property, military property and
<br>historical/cultural heritage. In particular, available
<br>information indicates that the documents contain specific
<br>information with respect to the location from which the
<br>materials were taken and identification of the nationality
<br>and the dates of coins and other artifacts. This information
<br>is believed to provide confirmation that the materials in
<br>question were taken from a warship of the Royal Navy of Spain
<br>that sank in battle during the early 19th Century and are
<br>property of the Royal Treasury of the Kingdom of Spain that
<br>was being transported by this vessel in service of the
<br>Kingdom Spain. Release of the requested documents is
<br>necessary to investigate the application of such laws and to
<br>assist U.S. Customs and such other competent U.S. agencies as
<br>may be authorized to have access to the documents for
<br>purposes of potential enforcement proceedings.
<br>
<br>¶3. The agencies of the Government of Spain that have
<br>competence in the investigation of this matter and/or in
<br>judicial enforcement proceedings, and to which the documents
<br>would therefore be made available: Spanish Customs, Ministry
<br>of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, Ministry of Culture,
<br>Ministry of Justice, Spanish Navy. It is understood that the
<br>documents shall be held in confidence by authorized
<br>representatives of the competent Spanish agencies and used
<br>only for investigation and/or enforcement proceedings in
<br>Spain and/or the U.S.
<br>
<br>Request B: That the possible violation by OME of U.S.
<br>customs or other rules be fully investigated and prosecuted
<br>by U.S. authorities.
<br>
<br>¶1. U.S. Customs laws OME might have violated: 18 U.S.C.
<br>Section 542 which prohibits the importation of materials by
<br>means of false statements; 18 U.S.C Section 545, which
<br>prohibits the importation of goods to the U.S. in violation
<br>of any law (which may include Spanish law); and 19 U.S.C.
<br>Section 1595a, which provides for seizure and forfeiture of
<br>goods imported in violation of relevant laws.
<br>
<br>¶2. The available information indicates that the
<br>importation of these materials may have occurred by means of
<br>false and/or misleading statements concerning the country of
<br>origin, ownership, value, legal status, and/or other
<br>characteristics of the imported materials. Additionally, as
<br>noted above, to the extent that specific information as to
<br>the location and identifying characteristics of the materials
<br>was provided in the documents, it is believed to constitute
<br>evidence of the taking and shipment to the U.S. of national
<br>property of Spain in violation of Spanish law concerning such
<br>property and corresponding U.S. laws concerning the
<br>importation of such property.
<br>
<br>¶3. Should additional information concerning this matter
<br>be needed at this stage, it would be provided on request on a
<br>
<br>MADRID 00001952 002.2 OF 002
<br>
<br>
<br>confidential basis. An investigative dossier is currently
<br>
<br>SIPDIS
<br>being assembled concerning the available evidence, for which
<br>the requested documents are needed, and will be made
<br>available to the U.S. Customs, the Department of State and
<br>such other U.S. agencies as may be deemed appropriate by the
<br>U.S.
