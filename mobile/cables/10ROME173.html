<br> 
<br>ROME 00000173  001.2 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Alexander Vershbow for Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D 
<br>) 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (S/NF) SUMMARY: Secretary of Defense Robert Gates (SecDef) 
<br>met with Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs Franco Frattini 
<br>during an official visit to Rome on February 8.  On 
<br>Afghanistan, Frattini was eager to move beyond the London 
<br>Conference and work to produce practical results for the 
<br>Afghan people.  He proposed better civil-military 
<br>coordination at senior levels in NATO, and raised the 
<br>prospect of coordination on local projects across the 
<br>Afghanistan-Iran border.  SecDef thanked Frattini for Italy's 
<br>pledge of more troops for operations in Afghanistan and 
<br>explained where gaps in civil-military cooperation existed. 
<br>Frattini believed the international community was lining up 
<br>against Iran, and encouraged better coordination with 
<br>countries outside the P5-plus-1.  SecDef warned that a 
<br>nuclear Iran would lead to greater proliferation in the 
<br>Middle East, war, or both.  SecDef agreed with Frattini that 
<br>a United Nations conference highlighting security challenges 
<br>in the Horn of Africa was a good idea.  END SUMMARY. 
<br> 
<br>------------ 
<br>Afghanistan 
<br>------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S/NF) Frattini opened by telling SecDef that the U.S. can 
<br>count on Italy's full support on Afghanistan, Iran and 
<br>fighting terror.  He had recently talked with General Jones 
<br>and Secretary Clinton and relayed the same message.  He 
<br>expressed a desire to focus on the comprehensive approach in 
<br>such a way to improve the daily lives of Afghans.  He 
<br>asserted a need to press President Karzai on delivering 
<br>improved governance or risk losing support for the mission in 
<br>coalition Parliaments.  Frattini wanted to get beyond "just 
<br>talking" -- referencing the London conference -- and noted 
<br>concrete Italian projects to convert poppy cultivation to 
<br>olive oil production and to create a national high school for 
<br>public administration. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S/NF) SecDef commended Rome's efforts to increase Italian 
<br>contributions, asking whether even more Carabinieri might be 
<br>available for training the Afghan security forces.  He 
<br>observed that General McChrystal's emphasis on protecting 
<br>Afghan civilians has changed attitudes among Allied publics. 
<br>SecDef said he is pushing the comprehensive approach, noting 
<br>a need for all stakeholders in Afghanistan to share 
<br>information effectively.  He said he hoped that NATO's new 
<br>Senior Civilian Representative, Ambassador Mark Sedwill, 
<br>could facilitate this.  SecDef recommended a focus on better 
<br>governance below the level of the national government -- 
<br>which would take decades to turn into a modern government ) 
<br>taking advantage of traditional institutions and competent 
<br>governors at the regional and sub-regional levels and 
<br>leveraging them into local success stories.  At the national 
<br>level, however, our priority should be to develop those 
<br>ministries most critical to our success, such as Defense, 
<br>Interior, Finance, Agriculture, and Health.  Noting Gen. 
<br>McChrystal's recent statement that the situation in 
<br>Afghanistan is no longer deteriorating, SecDef said that much 
<br>of the challenge is psychological -- convincing Afghans that 
<br>we can win and that we will not abandon them. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (S/NF) Frattini agreed that civilian-military integration 
<br>is the weakest part of the Afghan strategy.  He expressed 
<br>frustration that NATO foreign ministers only discuss issues 
<br>like agriculture and education while defense ministers only 
<br>discuss security.  The problem, Frattini suggested, is that 
<br>they don't talk to each other.  He proposed a joint meeting 
<br>of foreign and defense ministers, beginning with talks at the 
<br>expert level.  SecDef responded that Gen. McChrystal and 
<br>Ambassador Eikenberry do civilian-military collaboration at 
<br>the national level on the basis of a Joint Campaign Plan, as 
<br>do local ground commanders with leaders of PRTs.  What is 
<br>missing is the level in between -- the regional commands -- 
<br>and SecDef expressed a desire for Sedwill to appoint 
<br>subordinates to address this in each RC, building on the 
<br> 
<br>ROME 00000173  002.2 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>example of the civ-mil cell in RC-South.  The effect would be 
<br>cascading civil-military coordination at the national, 
<br>regional, and local levels.  SecDef noted that similar 
<br>efforts by UNSRSG Kai Eide had been hamstrung by resourcing 
<br>and the UN's aversion to working with the military.  As a 
<br>NATO representative, Sedwill should not have these problems. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (S/NF) Frattini also asked about practical cooperation 
<br>across the Afghan-Iranian border.  Local incentives for 
<br>cooperation might undermine weapons and drug trafficking and 
<br>help co-opt reconcilable Taliban.  SecDef noted that Iran is 
<br>playing both sides of the street -- trying to be friendly 
<br>with the Afghanistan government while trying to undermine 
<br>ISAF efforts.  He noted that intelligence indicated there was 
<br>little lethal material crossing the Afghanistan-Iran border. 
<br>SecDef suggested that trade route protection from Afghanistan 
<br>into Eastern Iran, which is important for local economies on 
<br>both sides of the border, might be a place to start.  SecDef 
<br>noted that any effort will need to be coordinated with Kabul. 
<br> Frattini agreed this would be a good starting point. 
<br> 
<br>---- 
<br>Iran 
<br>---- 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (S/NF) Frattini supported recent public statements by 
<br>SecDef raising the pressure on Iran.  He declared that 
<br>Ahmadinejad cannot be trusted, especially after contradicting 
<br>recent constructive statements by his own government. 
<br>Frattini, citing a recent conversation with Russian Foreign 
<br>Minister Lavrov, said he believed Russia would support the 
<br>sanctions track.  The challenge was to bring China on board; 
<br>China and India, in Frattini's view, were critical to the 
<br>adoption of measures that would affect the government without 
<br>hurting Iranian civil society.  He also specifically proposed 
<br>including Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Brazil, Venezuela and Egypt 
<br>in the conversation.  He expressed particular frustration 
<br>with Ankara's "double game" of outreach to both Europe and 
<br>Iran.  Frattini proposed an informal meeting of Middle East 
<br>countries, who were keen to be consulted on Iran, and noted 
<br>that Secretary Clinton was in agreement. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (S/NF) SecDef emphasized that a UNSC resolution was 
<br>important because it would give the European Union and 
<br>nations a legal platform on which to impose even harsher 
<br>sanctions against Iran.  SecDef pointedly warned that urgent 
<br>action is required.  Without progress in the next few months, 
<br>we risk nuclear proliferation in the Middle East, war 
<br>prompted by an Israeli strike, or both.  SecDef predicted "a 
<br>different world" in 4-5 years if Iran developed nuclear 
<br>weapons.  SecDef stated that he recently delivered the same 
<br>warning to PM Erdogan, and he agreed with Frattini's 
<br>assessment on Saudi Arabia and China, noting that Saudi 
<br>Arabia is more important to both Beijing and Moscow than 
<br>Iran. 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (S/NF) SecDef urged Frattini to reconsider a planned 
<br>visit to Italy by a prominent Iranian Parliamentarian in the 
<br>wake of recent executions of students in opposition to the 
<br>government. At the same time, we needed to ensure we did not 
<br>discredit the opposition by creating the impression that they 
<br>are the tools of foreign partners. 
<br> 
<br>-------------- 
<br>Horn of Africa 
<br>-------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C) Frattini expressed concern about deteriorating 
<br>conditions in Somalia and Yemen.  He noted a recent 
<br>conversation with President Sharif of Somalia's Transitional 
<br>Federal Government (TFG), in which Sharif said that he would 
<br>be unable to pay his security forces by the end of February. 
<br>Frattini said that Italy was encouraging the EU Presidency to 
<br>focus on Somalia and Yemen, and had proposed a United Nations 
<br>conference addressing Horn of Africa security issues.  Italy 
<br>was providing funding to the TFG's national budget. SecDef 
<br>concurred that the region deserved more focus.
