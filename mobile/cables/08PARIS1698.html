<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: France's new Africa policy may have its 
<br>most immediate impact on France's military presence in 
<br>Africa. The French are planning to consolidate their 
<br>military presence and want to orient it towards cooperation 
<br>with Africa's sub-regional groupings (e.g., ECOWAS, SADC, et 
<br>al.) and away from bilateral efforts. They foresee their 
<br>military presence coalescing into two hubs, one on the 
<br>Atlantic Ocean (Senegal or Gabon) and one on the Indian Ocean 
<br>(Djibouti or French overseas department Reunion Island). 
<br>Even these bases may eventually disappear if Africans prove 
<br>capable of maintaining peace and security. Another priority 
<br>will be the renegotiation of France's Defense Agreements with 
<br>eight African countries, which now feature outdated 
<br>provisions from the colonial era. The French announced in 
<br>June 2008 the set of priorities that will henceforth frame 
<br>French economic assistance to Africa. The Foreign Ministry 
<br>is creating a fourth "sous-direction" (akin to a Department 
<br>Office) that will more closely match Africa's sub-regional 
<br>groups, and may also reconfigure French Embassies in Africa 
<br>on a large, medium, and small basis to align priorities with 
<br>budget constraints. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Part I of this series (ref A) described the 
<br>"France-Afrique" model that governed France's relations with 
<br>sub-Saharan Africa for most of the 20th century. Even before 
<br>taking office in May 2007, President Nicolas Sarkozy believed 
<br>that relations needed revision in response to globalization, 
<br>changing circumstances, and the waning of the colonial and 
<br>immediate post-colonial periods. He sought a more modern and 
<br>transparent relationship, ostensibly of "equals," that would 
<br>allow both sides to conduct relations on a business-like and 
<br>rational basis. Part II (ref B) discussed France's first 
<br>steps (and missteps) in implementing this policy and African 
<br>reactions to it. This message (Part III) focuses on France's 
<br>military presence in Africa and organizational changes likely 
<br>to occur in conjunction with France's new policy. Post 
<br>welcomes comments from colleagues at U.S. missions in Africa.

<br>Conclusion 
<br>---------- 
<br>¶36. (C) In saying that he would "reform" France's Africa 
<br>policy, Sarkozy has taken on a task of formidable 
<br>proportions, which is no less than to break once and for all 
<br>from the colonial and post-colonial world and its mindset and 
<br>to bring relations into today's era. To do so, he must 
<br>overcome inertia and a certain level of comfort on both sides 
<br>that have accumulated over many years. Yet, as in other 
<br>areas of French policy, he seems determined to move forward 
<br>and has taken his first steps. In our view, this is a 
<br>positive development, for France-Afrique was becoming an 
<br>increasingly creaky, costly, and potentially dangerous 
<br>vehicle for dealing with a continent rife with challenges, 
<br>less amenable to heeding its former colonial masters, and 
<br>inescapably engaged in global issues of all kinds, from 
<br>terrorism, to the environment, to drug trafficking, to energy 
<br>resource management, and well beyond. 
<br>
<br>¶37. (C) But, will France-Afrique and old habits ever 
<br>completely fade? One MOD contact, not known for 
<br>sentimentality, believes that certain parts of France-Afrique 
<br>will endure, if for no other reason than the common use of 
<br>the French language and long intertwined histories. 
<br>Prefacing his remarks by noting their lack of "political 
<br>correctness" and their triteness, he says that the 
<br>relationship was for a long time similar to a parent-child 
<br>relationship. "Now, the child is an adult, capable of and 
<br>deserving of more autonomy, yet still welcoming our help and 
<br>guidance. What Sarkozy is doing is kicking the fledgling out 
<br>of the nest, which is sort of the way he approaches a lot of 
<br>problems. A heavy dose of what you might call 'tough love,' 
<br>not always dispensed lovingly. Eventually, the now-grown 
<br>adult child will be replaced by something resembling a cousin 
<br>or a nephew. We will grow farther apart and less apt to look 
<br>to each other reflexively, but some familial bond will 
<br>remain, however much we may seek to deny it, and familial 
<br>bonds are always to be nurtured. Our job is to make sure 
<br>that this inevitable drifting apart takes place positively on 
<br>both sides, does not completely extinguish the bond, and, 
<br>most importantly, does not turn into an estrangement. That 
<br>would be a loss for everyone -- French, Africans, and 
<br>Americans."
