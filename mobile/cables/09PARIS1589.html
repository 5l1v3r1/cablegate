<br>SUBJECT: CJCS MULLEN OUTLINES STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR 
<br>INCREASED CONTRIBUTIONS TO AFGHANISTAN WITH FRENCH CHIEF OF 
<br>DEFENSE 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Charles Rivkin for reasons 
<br>1.4 (b) and (d) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: CJCS Admiral Mike Mullen met with 
<br>French Chief of Defense(CHOD)General Jean-Louis Georgelin 
<br>to discuss the possibility of increasing the number of 
<br>French troops committed to Afghanistan, in advance of the 
<br>December 3-4 NATO Ministerial meetings. This discussion 
<br>was precipitated by the expected release of a new US 
<br>strategic framework for Afghanistan in the next two 
<br>weeks. US attendees were: CJCS ADM Mullen, Ambassador 
<br>Rivkin (US Ambassador to France), CAPT Mike Gilday (CJCS 
<br>Executive Officer), and COL T. Bruce Sweeney (US Defense 
<br>Attache to France). The French attendees were: GEN 
<br>Georgelin, Vice Admiral Rogel (French Deputy Chief of 
<br>Joint Staff for Operations), Rear Admiral Prazuk (French 
<br>Communications and Public Affairs Chief), and Mr. 
<br>Magnien, (Diplomatic Advisor to the CHOD). 
<br>GEN Georgelin indicated that the French indeed have 
<br>additional capacity to provide soldiers for Afghanistan, 
<br>but that the French Joint Staff currently does not have 
<br>the political support to do so. GEN Georgelin did not 
<br>provide a number of additional troops that could be 
<br>deployed, and did not respond to the Chairman regarding 
<br>suggested numbers. Gen Georgelin then discussed the 
<br>French President's public statement of "Not one more 
<br>soldier for Afghanistan," followed by suggestions of how 
<br>the US and NATO might approach France to get political 
<br>support for additional French troops. This is a DAO Paris 
<br>drafted message also reported as an IIR. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br>POLITICAL SITUATION: NO MORE TROOPS 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br>¶2. (C) The official French political position on 
<br>additional troops is that France "will not provide one 
<br>more soldier" for Afghanistan, as stated by President 
<br>Sarkozy in October 2009. In fact, GEN Georgelin spoke 
<br>with CJCS to discuss the possibility of additional French 
<br>troops for Afghanistan the day prior to President 
<br>Sarkozy's public statement. President Sarkozy made his 
<br>announcement without consulting Gen Georgelin. When GEN 
<br>Georgelin later met with the French President, Mr. 
<br>Sarkozy told GEN Georgelin he could perhaps add police 
<br>trainers, civilian or administrative personnel to boost 
<br>the total numbers of the French contribution, but no 
<br>additional soldiers would be sent for now. GEN Georgelin 
<br>stated that the President does not think that Afghanistan 
<br>is popular with French voters or other politicians and 
<br>that the President is concerned about the regional 
<br>elections in March and the success of his political party 
<br>in those elections. 
<br>
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br>FRENCH CHOD's SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br>¶3. (C) GEN Georgelin reviewed how the French troop level 
<br>in Afghanistan has increased over time, as well as how he 
<br>has managed to shape the French contribution into a more 
<br>effective combat force. GEN Georgelin has overseen a 
<br>significant increase from approximately 2000 troops to 
<br>over 3700 on the ground. This was partly effected by 
<br>changing off-site troop contributions into on-site 
<br>contributions (such as reducing French Naval support 
<br>personnel in the Indian Ocean while increasing French 
<br>Army troops in-country), and also by a direct increase in 
<br>the overall numbers of French troops committed to the 
<br>Afghanistan effort. Finally, GEN Georgelin has also 
<br>directed a change in mission for troops in Afghanistan in 
<br>order to provide a more potent combat force. By reducing 
<br>French contributions to the Operation Enduring Freedom 
<br>training mission (French troops had been running the 
<br>Officer's Training at the Afghan National Army Training 
<br>Command), and switching those billets to straight combat 
<br>troops, GEN Georgelin has effected an actual increase in 
<br>combat soldiers for his engaged units within the existing 
<br>3700 troop ceiling. French combat forces were recently 
<br>reinforced with two additional platoons of infantry 
<br>through this process. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- - 
<br>NATO FORCE GENERATION CONFERENCE FOR AFGHANISTAN 
<br>AND HOW TO GET THE FRENCH TO APPROVE ADDITIONAL FORCES 
<br>--------------------------------------------- - 
<br>¶4. (C) ADM Mullen said that he expected a Force 
<br>Generation Conference to be part of the NATO Ministerial 
<br>meeting in early December 2009, provided that President 
<br>Obama made his strategic decision for Afghanistan, and 
<br>that the strategic framework was provided to NATO allies. 
<br>GEN Georgelin then suggested that although a full court 
<br>press of reciprocal calls and visits might be appreciated 
<br>and even helpful, what was really necessary to get 
<br>approval of additional troops for Afghanistan was a 
<br>direct discussion between President Obama and President 
<br>Sarkozy. He said that President Obama must tell 
<br>President Sarkozy how important the French troop 
<br>contribution in Afghanistan was, how his vision in 
<br>Afghanistan was correct and aligned with that of the US, 
<br>how important and successful French re-integration into 
<br>NATO has been (including GEN Abriel, the French Supreme 
<br>Allied Commander for Transformation), and how much the US 
<br>needed his help personally, as well as how much we needed 
<br>additional French troops in Afghanistan. GEN Georgelin 
<br>further suggested that we should ask for additional 
<br>troops to take on training missions, thus lowering the 
<br>risk. Finally, GEN Georgelin declared that President 
<br>Obama must ask now, because it will be more difficult to 
<br>get a positive result closer to or after the regional 
<br>French elections in March. In effect, President Obama 
<br>must speak to President Sarkozy now, and flattery will 
<br>get you everywhere in this case. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Finally, GEN Georgelin discussed the fact that 
<br>successful French Presidents since De Gaulle have put 
<br>the United States and NATO at some distance in order 
<br>to have independent freedom of action, both politically and 
<br>militarily. President Sarkozy has not done this, but has 
<br>been, until recently, a true Atlanticist. Sarkozy's 
<br>early trip to the US, his decision for France to rejoin 
<br>NATO as a full member, and other moves have put him at 
<br>odds with the French electorate and French elite. Thus, 
<br>President Sarkozy is currently trying to distance himself 
<br>from the US and improve his domestic popularity and 
<br>appeal. Georgelin said that the President may be feeling 
<br>vulnerable just now, and even if he agrees to additional 
<br>troops for Afghanistan (if President Obama asks him) he 
<br>will not take the position publicly until after the 
<br>French regional elections in March. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- - 
<br>WHAT CAN FRANCE CONTRIBUTE? 
<br>--------------------------------------------- - 
<br>¶6. (C) General Georgelin did not specify a number for 
<br>additional troop contributions. CJCS stated that he was 
<br>looking for a total of 5,000 - 25,000 additional troops 
<br>from all NATO countries and suggested 2,000 from France. 
<br>The French laughed (with the Chairman) at this. CJCS 
<br>later opined once again that France could provide 2,000 
<br>troops and this also generated some nervous laughter. 
<br>Georgelin said that the numbers discussed within the 
<br>French Joint Staff have been approximately 1,500 troops, 
<br>which would put total French contributions at 5,250. 
<br>Although 5,250 is a large number for the French, it is 
<br>sustainable given the total number of French forces and 
<br>their reduced presence at overseas bases forecast by the 
<br>French Government's White Paper. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) GEN Georgelin believes that NATO has 
<br>accomplished an awful lot in Afghanistan, further believes 
<br>that more can be collectively accomplished there, and 
<br>thinks GEN McChrystal's strategy and way of thinking is 
<br>the right way to go in Afghanistan. He feels that ISAF 
<br>will be successful in changing dynamics in Afghanistan 
<br>if we all go forward together, and he sees French forces 
<br>as an integral part of that successful effort.
