<br>Summary 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) The September 4 arrests of three terrorist suspects, 
<br>two of whom are German citizens who converted to Islam, has 
<br>given Germany its first high-profile case of homegrown 
<br>Islamic terrorism and focused attention on the southern 
<br>German area of Ulm/Neu-Ulm, which authorities have long 
<br>identified as a hotbed of radical Islam. The arrests of 
<br>Gelowicz and Schneider, both ethnic Germans and life-long 
<br>residents of Germany, have changed public perceptions 
<br>concerning the threat of Islamic extremism in Germany and 
<br>raised questions within political circles as to what 
<br>potential measures should be taken to more closely monitor 
<br>extremists. Furthermore, the news that the three suspects 
<br>received instructions from Pakistan-based Islamic Jihad Union 
<br>(IJU) leadership has generated a new awareness and 
<br>recognition of the need to increase surveillance capabilities 
<br>as well as enhance cooperation with international partners. 
<br>The Interior and Justice Ministries are preparing legislation 
<br>to strengthen the capabilities of prosecutors and increase 
<br>the investigative powers of security officials to counter the 
<br>homegrown terrorist threat. End Summary 
<br>
<br>Germany's First Homegrown Islamic Terrorists 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) The September 4 arrests of three suspects planning 
<br>large-scale attacks in Germany has sent shockwaves through 
<br>Germany, given that two of the alleged terrorists, Fritz 
<br>Gelowicz and Daniel Martin Schneider, were German citizens 
<br>with non-immigrant backgrounds who converted to Islam as 
<br>teenagers (Ref A). Previous terrorist cases over recent 
<br>history have typically involved individuals with immigrant 
<br>backgrounds and/or dual nationalities who were generally 
<br>raised as Muslims from birth. Although there has been at 
<br>least one previous instance in which a German convert has 
<br>taken up arms in the cause of Islam (e.g., Thomas "Hamza" 
<br>Fischer who died fighting in Chechnya in 2003), the current 
<br>case is the first in which such converts were planning their 
<br>attacks on German soil against German (and U.S.) targets. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (U) Media coverage and editorials immediately following 
<br>the arrests have expressed shock at how Gelowicz and 
<br>Schneider, who had been raised in unremarkable typical German 
<br>circumstances, managed to adopt an Islamic extremist ideology 
<br>and plan violence against their fellow citizens. There has 
<br>been much hand-wringing and anxious speculation on how many 
<br>other potential homegrown terrorists in Germany might be 
<br>planning similar attacks. A poll (by the national polling 
<br>firm Emnid) taken shortly following the arrests indicated 
<br>that 85 percent of the public believe the threat of terrorist 
<br>attacks in Germany has increased. This same poll showed that 
<br>56 percent of the public believe a strengthening of security 
<br>legislation is the best response to the new threat. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (U) As the arrests have highlighted the homegrown 
<br>terrorist threat, there have been calls for government 
<br>monitoring of German converts to Islam, who number in the 
<br>thousands each year. Though not likely to see the 
<br>legislative light of day (see Septel), this proposal is a 
<br>reaction to the perception that converts often tend to be 
<br>more zealous believers in their new faith compared to those 
<br>born into the religion. Minister Schaeuble, who leads the 
<br>Federal government's "German Islam Conference" initiative, 
<br>which attempts to promote an intercultural dialogue with the 
<br>Muslim community, commented that "One thing is certain: 
<br>fighting the abuse of Islam and exaggerated fundamentalism 
<br>is, above all, a task for the Muslims themselves." 
<br>
<br>Ulm/Neu-Ulm - Centers of Radicalization 
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (U) The Federal Prosecutors Office has identified a number 
<br>of German cities as centers of Islamic associations and 
<br>potential sites for extremism, including Ulm, Neu-Ulm, 
<br>Braunschweig, Cologne, Berlin and Muenster. Of these, the 
<br>neighboring cities of Ulm and Neu-Ulm have figured the most 
<br>
<br>BERLIN 00001767 002 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>prominently over the past decade as breeding grounds for 
<br>Islamic extremists. Ulm, a mid-sized city (population 
<br>120,000) in Germany's relatively conservative southern state 
<br>of Baden-Wuerttemberg, is a leading center for scientific 
<br>research and birthplace of Albert Einstein. Ulm was rated as 
<br>Germany's most healthy city by the health-oriented magazine 
<br>"Healthy Living" in a nationwide survey last month. Neu-Ulm 
<br>(population 51,000) is located on the eastern side of the 
<br>Danube river in Bavaria. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (U) The cities received an influx of Muslim refugees from 
<br>Bosnia in the mid 1990s, adding to their existing Muslim 
<br>communities which came mainly from Turkey. Despite their 
<br>traditionally moderate take on Islam, Bosnian Muslims 
<br>developed ties with international extremists who were often 
<br>viewed as the first to respond in Bosnia's hour of need. 
<br>During the 1990s, the region was seen as a staging point for 
<br>Muslim extremist fighters going to Bosnia. More recently, 
<br>Ulm and Neu-Ulm have both hosted organizations that have 
<br>played central roles in Germany's radical Islamist spheres. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) The Multicultural House (MCH) in Neu-Ulm was founded 
<br>in 1996 and in the nine years that it was open attracted a 
<br>series of noteworthy individuals and Islamic extremists 
<br>including: 
<br>
<br>-- Mahmoud Salim, Osama Bin Laden's chief of financial 
<br>operations who visited in September 1998. 
<br>
<br>-- Reda Seyam, alleged to be one of the planners of the Bali 
<br>attacks of 12 October 2002. 
<br>
<br>-- Dr. Yehia Yousif, an Egyptian who first came to Germany in 
<br>1988 as a researcher but later became a jihad recruiter and 
<br>hate preacher who took on a leading role at the MCH. Yousif 
<br>left Germany in 2002 as investigations of his activities 
<br>increased. Yousif's oldest son, who is alleged to have spent 
<br>time in a Pakistan terrorist training camp, was deported 
<br>after investigators found bomb-making instruction manuals in 
<br>his apartment. 
<br>
<br>-- Khaled al-Masri was a visitor to the MCH. 
<br>
<br>-- Mohammed Atta, one of the 9/11 terrorist pilots, is 
<br>reported to have visited the MCH. 
<br>
<br>-- Fritz Gelowicz is reported to have been a frequent visitor 
<br>of the MCH. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Following prolonged observation and investigation, 
<br>Bavarian officials finally closed the MCH on 28 December 2005 
<br>and banned it on grounds that it promoted activities hostile 
<br>to the constitution. Bavarian authorities indicate that MCH 
<br>members had used the facility as a recruiting station for 
<br>global jihad and distribution source of extremist literature. 
<br>The ban was subsequently confirmed by the courts in January 
<br>2007 (Ref C). 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) The Islamic Information Center (IIC), founded in 1999 
<br>and located in Ulm, has developed into a center of extremist 
<br>activity particularly following the closure of the MCH. 
<br>Given its location in a different federal state, 
<br>Baden-Wuerrtemberg security officials monitoring the IIC have 
<br>needed to overcome coordination issues with their 
<br>counterparts in Bavaria to ensure that extremists cannot 
<br>escape observations by merely crossing the Danube river. 
<br>Baden-Wuerttemberg authorities have listed the IIC as an 
<br>extremist center since 2003. Fritz Gelowicz is reported to 
<br>have joined the center in 2005 under the name Abdullah after 
<br>following an introduction by his co-worker Tolga Duerbin. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Authorities searched the IIC in conjunction with the 
<br>September 4 arrests and hope that materials collected will 
<br>enable them to close the center. Baden-Wuerrtemberg Minister 
<br>of Interior Heribert Rech commented that he is confident that 
<br>these materials will be sufficient to close the IIZ 
<br>permanently. Ulm's mayor has also expressed the desire to 
<br>close the center. 
<br>
<br>Links to International Networks 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) All three of the terrorist suspects arrested 
<br>
<br>BERLIN 00001767 003 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>September 4 are believed to have trained in Islamic Jihad 
<br>Union (IJU) camps in Pakistan, and shortly following the 
<br>arrests IJU leadership issued a statement confirming that the 
<br>three had indeed been operating under IJU direction. The 
<br>confirmation of this connection between an overseas terrorist 
<br>organization and the Germany-based suspects demonstrates that 
<br>the terrorist threat to Germany had reached a new level. 
<br>Previous Islamic terrorism cases in Germany have not reached 
<br>this level of sophistication and organization. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) The arrests in Pakistan and subsequent deportations 
<br>back to Germany of multiple German citizens, or those with 
<br>German residency permission, in the past few months has 
<br>proven just how potentially widespread the links are between 
<br>Germany-based Islamic extremists and overseas terrorist 
<br>leadership. Some of these individuals, such as Tolga 
<br>Duerbin, have been arrested on their return to Germany while 
<br>others, such as Aleem Nasir and Nihad C., have been permitted 
<br>to remain free. In any case terrorist training camp 
<br>returnees are cause for concern among security officials. 
<br>
<br>Government Responses 
<br>-------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶13. (U) In a September 16 interview Minister Schaeuble summed 
<br>up how the arrests had changed the political debate, saying: 
<br>"We now know better than before that we are very much in the 
<br>focus of Islamist terrorists." Since the arrests, Schaeuble 
<br>has increased his calls for quick cabinet agreement on a 
<br>number of legislative proposals to enhance the powers of the 
<br>Federal Criminal Police (BKA) in counterterrorism 
<br>investigations, as well as to permit the surveillance of the 
<br>computers of terrorism suspects (Ref B). This proposal for 
<br>on-line computer investigations has been particularly 
<br>controversial due to privacy concerns but Schaeuble has 
<br>remained adamant, stating "We will not submit a BKA bill 
<br>without including the option of on-line searches." 
<br>
<br>¶14. (U) Separately, the Justice Ministry has drafted a 
<br>proposal that would significantly increase prosecutorial 
<br>powers aimed at those who train in foreign terrorist camps as 
<br>well as permit authorities to take earlier action against 
<br>those in the planning stages of a terrorist attacik (see 
<br>Septel for analysis). 
<br>
<br>¶15. (U) This cable has been coordinated and developed jointly 
<br>with Consulates General Munich and Frankfurt.
