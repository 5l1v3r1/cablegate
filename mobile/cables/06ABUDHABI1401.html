<br> 
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Michele J. Sison, reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (S) Summary. Embassy Abu Dhabi looks forward to welcoming 
<br>you to the UAE on April 23.  In the aftermath of the 
<br>controversy of the Dubai Ports World acquisition of P&O, your 
<br>assurances to Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin 
<br>Zayed (MbZ), your host for the visit, that the USG values the 
<br>UAE as an ally and friend will be well received.  While you 
<br>should commend the UAE for its assistance and cooperation, 
<br>you should take advantage of your luncheon with MbZ and his 
<br>brother, State Security Director Sheikh Hazza, to push the 
<br>UAE on several areas of interest to the USG: 
<br>counterterrorism, counter terror finance, Iran, Hamas, Iraq, 
<br>and ideological extremism (each is covered in the 
<br>scenesetter).  The UAE remains a committed partner in the 
<br>global war on terror, but it continues to take an ad hoc 
<br>approach to countering terrorism that "solves" the problem 
<br>for the UAE locally, but fails to contribute on a 
<br>transnational basis.  In January, the U.S. and the UAE held 
<br>the first meeting of the Joint Terrorist Finance Coordinating 
<br>Committee (JTFCC), but the discussions were not as detailed 
<br>or as robust as the U.S. delegation anticipated.  Treasury 
<br>U/S Levey will return to the UAE to hold a second meeting 
<br>April 30 that will focus on cash couriers and charities. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S) Although the UAE regards Iran as one of its most 
<br>serious threats to national security, UAE officials are 
<br>reluctant to take actions that could anger their neighbor and 
<br>compromise their extensive trading relationship.  At the same 
<br>time, we are seeing more of a willingness on the part of the 
<br>UAE to support USG initiatives without the full approval of 
<br>the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).  As tensions escalate 
<br>between Iran and the international community, the UAE is 
<br>growing increasingly nervous.  The UAE leadership--which has 
<br>told us they consider Hamas a terrorist organization--plans 
<br>to uphold its previous commitments of humanitarian assistance 
<br>to the Palestinian people.  The UAE has taken an active role 
<br>in encouraging Sunni participation in the Iraqi political 
<br>process and it continues to condemn the sectarian violence 
<br>that is preventing stabilization of the country.  In the face 
<br>of growing ideological extremism in the Gulf, the UAE 
<br>leadership is politically determined not to allow Islamist 
<br>extremists to gain a foothold on UAE soil.  End Summary. 
<br> 
<br>Counterterrorism Efforts 
<br>------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S) The UAE is concerned about the terrorist threat to the 
<br>UAE, but lacks a comprehensive implementation strategy for 
<br>reducing its vulnerability (ref A).  The UAE considers 
<br>homeland security one of its top priorities, but rather than 
<br>prioritizing national security projects, its efforts have 
<br>focused on contracting risk assessments, forming committees, 
<br>and procuring equipment.  The UAE has also aggressively tried 
<br>to prevent the radicalization of UAE nationals and Arab/South 
<br>Asian expatriates.  UAE officials publicly and strongly 
<br>condemn extremism and terrorist attacks, anti-extremism has 
<br>been the focus of government-approved Friday sermons in the 
<br>mosques, and the UAE ministry of Education has modernized the 
<br>Islamic studies curriculum in its schools. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (S) The UAEG government reacts quickly when presented with 
<br>evidence of a terrorist presence inside the UAE, but does not 
<br>approach the problem from a transnational manner.  The UAE's 
<br>immediate response when terrorists pose a risk is to deport 
<br>them.  UAE agencies do not investigate fully to see how far 
<br>the problem goes or whether there is an international network 
<br>involved.  Although the U.S./UAE counterterrorism cooperation 
<br>is strong (with the UAE working closely with the USG on 
<br>specific cases), Emiratis do not consistently share lead 
<br>information found in the possession of individuals in their 
<br>custody with each other or with the U.S. Government.  These 
<br>tactics limit law enforcement and intelligence services' 
<br>ability to use intelligence to disrupt extremist cells and 
<br>planned attacks.  The UAE's insistence on deportation as a 
<br>solution does not protect the country long-term or truly 
<br>address the nature and scope of the problem.  The UAEG must 
<br>be willing to take action against Emirati nationals, it must 
<br>investigate fully, and it must share information with other 
<br>Gulf countries and with the USG. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (S) The only way to generate significant change in the UAE 
<br>on the issue of counterterrorism is to convince the senior 
<br>leadership that it needs to continue to display political 
<br>will and commitment in tackling the terror challenge with a 
<br>transnational approach.  MbZ is the person most able to 
<br>elicit this type of change.  Embassy recommends you have a 
<br>frank and forthright discussion during your meeting with MbZ 
<br>and his younger brother, Hazza, to encourage this type of 
<br>change.  Although you should commend them for the UAE's CT 
<br>efforts and cooperation, you should also encourage them to be 
<br>personally involved in developing a more effective and fully 
<br>cooperative counterterrorism posture. 
<br> 
<br>Counterterrorism Finance 
<br>------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (S) The UAE has made significant strides in regulating the 
<br>financial sector against money laundering and terrorist 
<br>financing (ref B).  Although the UAE now has a strong legal 
<br>framework in place, it must turn its efforts to enforcement. 
<br>It is imperative that UAE authorities investigate and 
<br>prosecute violators of terror finance/anti-money laundering, 
<br>cash courier, and charity laws and regulations.  To date, 
<br>investigation and prosecution has been weak.  In an effort to 
<br>increase U.S. and UAE cooperation on terrorist financing, the 
<br>first meeting of the U.S/UAE Joint Terrorist Finance 
<br>Coordinating Committee (JTFCC) was held in Abu Dhabi on 
<br>January 24, 2005 (ref C).  The UAE team had representatives 
<br>from the Central Bank, State Security, Ministries of 
<br>Interior, Foreign Affairs, and Justice.  However, no one 
<br>participated from Dubai.  In order for the JTFCC to be an 
<br>effective committee, Dubai's Police, State Security, Customs, 
<br>and the Department of Islamic Affairs and Charities must 
<br>participate.  Embassy is coordinating a second meeting April 
<br>30 that will focus on cash couriers and charity regulations. 
<br> 
<br>Iran 
<br>---- 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (S/NF) UAE leaders are very concerned about escalating 
<br>tensions between Iran and the international community.  The 
<br>UAE feels vulnerable--as evidenced by the fact that its 
<br>leaders frequently note that Iran is "very near" the UAE. 
<br>Commercial ties between Dubai and Iran are significant (Dubai 
<br>is Iran's largest non-oil trading partner), and as a result 
<br>the UAEG walks a fine line between maintaining and 
<br>encouraging this trade and working to prevent suspected 
<br>Iranian proliferation activities.  Although the UAEG is 
<br>worried about Iran's nuclear ambitions, its short-term policy 
<br>decisions regarding Iran center on not provoking its 
<br>neighbor.  The USG has approached the UAEG four times since 
<br>January, asking it to interdict and inspect cargo suspected 
<br>of going to Iran's nuclear and/or missile programs.  None of 
<br>those instances have resulted in a successful interdiction. 
<br>In the first two instances UAE officials simply refused to 
<br>take action (refs F and G).  The Director of Dubai's State 
<br>Security Organization explained during the 11 February 
<br>U.S./UAE Counterproliferation Task Force meeting that the 
<br>decision to not inspect the containers had been a political 
<br>decision based on the UAE's concern that Iran might retaliate 
<br>(ref H).  In the two later instances (ref K), ships that had 
<br>been scheduled to arrive in Dubai went directly to Bandar 
<br>Abbas. 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (S) In recent meetings with senior USG officials, MbZ has 
<br>expressed clear support for U.S. initiatives against Iran. 
<br>MbZ and UAE Vice President and Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed 
<br>bin Rashid agreed with Secretary Rice February 23 about the 
<br>need to counter Iran's growing influence in the region and 
<br>its nuclear ambitions, although they specified that any 
<br>sanctions should target the key Iranian leadership, not the 
<br>Iranian people (ref I).  MbZ told A/S Welch March 28 that he 
<br>did not think it was necessary to wait for all Gulf 
<br>Cooperation Council (GCC) countries to agree before 
<br>proceeding with any plans against Iran (ref E).  "Whoever is 
<br>interested in getting on board ship should be encouraged," he 
<br>said.  "I don't think it's logical or smart to wait for 
<br>everyone to get involved so we can sail. ... If another GCC 
<br>member believes it's not right, that's his choice."  In the 
<br>Arab region, MbZ specifically identified Bahrain and Jordan 
<br>as two countries that also view Iran as a threat and that are 
<br>"capable to work with us."  He told A/S Welch that the UAE 
<br>would prepare a paper responding to USG concerns about Iran 
<br>and mechanisms for addressing the challenge posed by Iran. 
<br>In a March 27 meeting with CENTCOM Commander General Abizaid, 
<br>MbZ spoke about the Iranian threat with a greater sense of 
<br>urgency.  He was strongly in favor of taking action against 
<br>Iran and its president sooner rather than later.  "I believe 
<br>this guy is going to take us to war. ... It's a matter of 
<br>time," MbZ warned, adding that action against Iran and 
<br>President Ahmedinejad should be taken this year or next year. 
<br> MbZ said he was unwilling to wait much longer.  "Personally, 
<br>I cannot risk it with a guy like Ahmedinejad.  He is young 
<br>and aggressive." 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (S/NF) SSD Director Hazza told A/S Welch March 29 that the 
<br>Ayatollah Ali Khameini had once issued a fatwa prohibiting 
<br>the use of nuclear weapons by Iran, but noted that this 
<br>should not be considered a guarantee.  Hazza assessed that 
<br>Iran is also a threat due to its ties to international 
<br>terrorist organizations, including al-Qaida, as well as their 
<br>financial support to Hamas.  He added that the relationship 
<br>between Iran and Syria, and their links to Hizballah, was 
<br>also of concern, as was Iran's attempts to expand its 
<br>influence in Iraq and elsewhere in the world.  MbZ also 
<br>expressed to A/S Welch March 28 the concern that Hizballah 
<br>was supporting Hamas.  During your meeting, you should 
<br>explain the graduated approach to addressing Iran in the 
<br>United Nations Security Council and encourage the UAE to 
<br>isolate Iran--regardless of potential economic backlash.  You 
<br>should also explain the importance of the UAE working closely 
<br>with the USG on interdiction requests.  This meeting will be 
<br>a good follow-on to the discussion U/S Joseph had with 
<br>Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan (AbZ) on April 
<br>8, where Joseph outlined the USG's policy priorities for Iran 
<br>(septel).  (Note: While AbZ, like MbZ, expressed support for 
<br>U.S. initiatives against Iran, he stated that the USG should 
<br>come to the UAE as a "very last resort. ... If you can solve 
<br>something without involving the UAE, please do so."  End 
<br>Note.) 
<br> 
<br>Palestinian Territories/Hamas 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (S) UAE leaders have told us that they consider Hamas a 
<br>terrorist organization and that they would not fund Hamas 
<br>unless they denounce violence (refs D and E).  However, after 
<br>Hamas political chief Khaled Meshaal visited Abu Dhabi on 
<br>March 22 and met with UAE Minister of Presidential Affairs 
<br>Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan and Minister of State for 
<br>Foreign Affairs Mohammed al-Sha'ali, Meshaal publicly claimed 
<br>that the UAEG had pledged to continue to provide financial 
<br>assistance to the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority (ref J). 
<br>MbZ told A/S Welch March 28 that the UAEG allowed Meshaal to 
<br>come, but that "officially, we don't recognize Khaled 
<br>Meshaal."  MbZ said that once a new Palestinian Prime 
<br>Minister is selected, UAEG officials will travel to the 
<br>Palestinian territories to ascertain that UAEG assistance is 
<br>"going to the right people."  UAE Vice President and Prime 
<br>Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid sounded a note of 
<br>optimism when he told Secretary Rice February 23 that Hamas, 
<br>"with some pressure," would understand the need to respect 
<br>the will of the international community. 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (S) The UAE has historically provided significant 
<br>financial assistance to the Palestinian people.  Typically, 
<br>the UAE sends aid to the Palestinian territories through 
<br>charity organizations, or by projectized assistance; but the 
<br>UAEG has also provided financial assistance directly to the 
<br>Palestinian Authority, most recently $20 million in March 
<br>2006 to Mahmoud Abbas for salaries.  In the wake of the Hamas 
<br>electoral victory, UAE leaders told us they intend to honor 
<br>their previous commitments of humanitarian assistance 
<br>(including the $100 million Sheikh Khalifa housing complex 
<br>that was announced last year). 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (S/NF) In his meeting with A/S Welch March 29, SSD 
<br>Director Hazza assessed that there was both a positive and a 
<br>negative side to the Hamas election win.  On the negative 
<br>side, he cited Hamas' position with regard to Israel, and 
<br>their violent agenda.  On the positive side, Hazza noted the 
<br>fact that Hamas was now in power and was accountable to the 
<br>international community.  He spoke to A/S Welch of the threat 
<br>posed by the Muslim Brotherhood.  Hazza also asked A/S Welch 
<br>how the USG would react to those countries that did support 
<br>the Hamas government, and whether they would run afoul of 
<br>U.S. laws restricting support to terrorist organizations. 
<br>A/S Welch replied that that would be a problem, emphasizing 
<br>that no money should go to the government unless Hamas 
<br>renounced violence and accepted Israel.  A/S Welch also told 
<br>Hazza that it was not the responsibility of the U.S. or other 
<br>Arab countries to pay the salaries of the new Hamas 
<br>government, underscoring the need for Hamas to show 
<br>accountability.  MbZ told A/S Welch that Hamas benefited from 
<br>"official and private contributions" from Saudi Arabia, 
<br>Kuwait, and Qatar.  MbZ said it was "easy to take $1 million 
<br>in a suitcase" to Lebanon, alluding to cash couriers. 
<br> 
<br>Iraq 
<br>---- 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (S/NF) A partner in the war on terror, the UAE continues 
<br>to provide U.S. forces access, overflight clearances, and 
<br>other critical logistical assistance to Operation Iraqi 
<br>Freedom (and Operation Enduring Freedom).  The UAE has also 
<br>been a helpful supporter of Iraq's burgeoning political 
<br>process.  It has worked with Iraqi political and religious 
<br>figures to encourage greater Sunni integration, and it has 
<br>consulted with Ambassador Khalilzad on a number of occasions 
<br>about the need to stem sectarianism in Iraq.  The UAE has 
<br>publicly condemned acts of sectarian and terrorist violence 
<br>in Iraq, most recently, the February 22 bombing of the 
<br>al-Askariya Shrine.  MbZ and Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid 
<br>expressed their concerns about Iran's interference in Iraq's 
<br>internal affairs to Secretary Rice during her visit to Abu 
<br>Dhabi February 23.  MbZ further told General Abizaid that 
<br>discontent with Iraqi Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Ja'afari was 
<br>creating volunteers for al-Qaida.  He pledged the UAE's 
<br>support to the fight against al-Qaida.  In his meeting with 
<br>A/S Welch, MbZ advocated using the Arabic language media to 
<br>tell Iraqis the truth about how many of their own people are 
<br>dying at the hands of the insurgents.  If Iraqis were to see 
<br>the figures, he opined, they would conclude that support of 
<br>the insurgency is "not worth it." 
<br> 
<br>Ideological Extremism 
<br>--------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶14. (S) MbZ and his brothers continue to be outspoken on the 
<br>issue of Muslim extremists and the threat they pose to the 
<br>region.  MbZ underscored for A/S Welch the UAE's preferred 
<br>approach of denying extremists a foothold rather than 
<br>allowing them to play a role in the political process. 
<br>Although he warns of the dangers of free elections in 
<br>countries with a well-organized Muslim Brotherhood presence, 
<br>he tells USG guests that the UAE will go ahead with 
<br>elections.  The Emirati leadership has told us that they will 
<br>not allow Islamists to participate in elections.  (Note: The 
<br>UAE has announced that half of the members of the Federal 
<br>National Council would be elected while half would continue 
<br>to be appointed by the rulers of the various emirates. 
<br>Despite this announcement, the UAE still lags behind other 
<br>Gulf states in terms of democratization.  End Note.)  MbZ 
<br>also sees extremist ideology threatening the educational 
<br>system, where he and his brothers are spending considerable 
<br>resources to modernize the curriculum and the teaching corps.
