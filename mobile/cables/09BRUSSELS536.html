<br>Classified By: USEU EconMinCouns Peter Chase for reasons 1.4 (b), (d), 
<br>(e). 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (S//NF) SUMMARY AND COMMENT:  During a March 2-3 visit to 
<br>Brussels, Daniel Glaser, Acting Assistant Secretary of the 
<br>Treasury for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes, 
<br>assured an uncertain European Union that the United States 
<br>remains committed to the dual track approach to Iran and said 
<br>we would welcome additional EU designations targeting Iran's 
<br>proliferation and sanctions evasion activities.  Delivering 
<br>an unprecedented classified briefing to over 70 Middle East 
<br>and nonproliferation experts from all 27 EU states and 
<br>institutions, Glaser encouraged the EU to move forward on 
<br>specific designations to support the current international 
<br>framework targeting Iran's illicit conduct through financial 
<br>measures. 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (C) EU Member States and officials uniformly praised the 
<br>U.S. information-sharing on sanctions and the U.S. policy 
<br>review.  Capturing the predominant sentiment, the Czech 
<br>Presidency expressed gratitude for AA/S Glaser's presentation 
<br>and confirmation that further EU measures "would be 
<br>consistent with the U.S. policy review" as a signal the EU 
<br>"are all waiting for, as this plays an important role in EU 
<br>considerations."  However, some EUMS were uncertain whether 
<br>they should move forward on pending designations before the 
<br>completion of the policy review.  During the briefing and on 
<br>its margins, member states' concerns emerged over national 
<br>economic interests, unintended consequences (e.g., hurting 
<br>average Iranians, sanctions efficacy, Iran's regional role, 
<br>lawsuits, and international unity).  Glaser's separate 
<br>consultations with representatives from the Council 
<br>Secretariat and Commission, and Ambassadors of the Czech 
<br>Republic (Presidency), UK, France, Germany, Spain, and 
<br>incoming EU-Presidency Sweden are reported septel. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C) The content, tone, and timing of AA/S Glaser's 
<br>briefing impressed an appreciative EU audience as a sign of 
<br>the new U.S. Administration's seriousness about engagement 
<br>with Europe.  The EU is predisposed to respond positively to 
<br>the new Administration's policy on Iran and wants its views 
<br>taken into account during the policy review stage. 
<br>Glaser's presentation kept the good feelings going, but also 
<br>helped bring EU experts down to earth in terms of specific 
<br>tasks on which the EU could usefully focus now.  We hope the 
<br>briefing provides a basis for further USG lobbying in 
<br>individual EU Member States in capitals on pending EU 
<br>designations.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>U.S. Message:  EU Should Act -- 
<br>2009 The Critical Year 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (S) On March 3, the Czech EU Presidency convened a formal 
<br>meeting of the EU-27 Iran and non-proliferation experts 
<br>(COMOG/CONOP) to receive a classified briefing from a U.S. 
<br>interagency delegation led by AA/S Glaser on measures in the 
<br>financial and transport sectors to counter Iran's illicit 
<br>conduct.  The session lasted a little over an hour (40 minute 
<br>presentation followed by 30 minutes of Q/A).  Given intense 
<br>EU interest and in order to set the political context for the 
<br>detailed technical briefing on specific U.S. designations 
<br>that followed, AA/S Glaser  noted that the U.S. policy review 
<br>on Iran had not yet finalized, but it was already clear that 
<br> 
<br>BRUSSELS 00000536  002 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>the USG would remain committed to a dual track approach to 
<br>resolving the nuclear issue.  Consequently, the United States 
<br>would welcome EU actions now to reinforce existing UNSCRs. 
<br>The EU should act quickly to designate additional high 
<br>priority proliferation targets. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (S) To be sure, "engagement" would be an important aspect 
<br>of a comprehensive strategy to dissuade Iran from acquiring 
<br>nuclear weapons.  However, "engagement" alone is unlikely to 
<br>succeed. Diplomacy's best chance of success requires all 
<br>elements combining pressure and incentives to work 
<br>simultaneously, not sequentially.  Our shared challenge is to 
<br>work together in finding the right mix of measures.  Time was 
<br>not on our side.  The international community must urgently 
<br>choose between several bad options facing us in 2009; none of 
<br>these options were without cost.  Glaser pointed out that the 
<br>dynamic nature of the international financial system required 
<br>that targeted financial sanctions against Iran must be 
<br>continually adjusted to maintain, let alone increase, 
<br>pressure on Iran.  Over time, targeted Iranian entities were 
<br>finding ways to evade sanctions via front companies and 
<br>facilitators.  Without continuous active management on the 
<br>part of the international community, the measures taken thus 
<br>far would be rendered merely symbolic gestures. 
<br> 
<br>¶6.   (S) Glaser stated that the EU had an important, but 
<br>time-sensitive, opportunity to help diplomacy succeed by 
<br>targeting illicit Iranian conduct that contravened UN 
<br>Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs). The international 
<br>framework for moving forward was already in place, under the 
<br>auspices of the UNSCRs and the Financial Action Task Force 
<br>(FATF). ; we should continue to support and operate within 
<br>this framework.  Glaser urged the EU not to Underestimate its 
<br>influence on the actions of other key countries and regions. 
<br> 
<br>Priority Designation Targets 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (S) AA/S Glaser's formal presentation provided U.S. views 
<br>and specific intelligence on financial and transport entities 
<br>under active EU consideration for designation, including Bank 
<br>Mellat, the Export Development Bank of Iran (EDBI), Bank 
<br>Saderat, the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Line (IRISL), 
<br>and Iran Air (the only entity not yet U.S.-designated, which 
<br>AA/S Glaser explained remains a potential target). 
<br>Separately, several EU contacts found our case against Bank 
<br>Mellat, EDBI and shipping companies to be particularly well 
<br>formulated. 
<br> 
<br>---------------------- 
<br>EU Audience, Reactions 
<br>---------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (C) All 27 EU Member States (EUMS) attended the Czech 
<br>Presidency-hosted classified briefing on March 3 in Brussels. 
<br> Indicative of the EU's high level of interest, all but 
<br>Slovakia sent their capitals-based nonproliferation working 
<br>group ("CONOP") technical expert in addition to their Middle 
<br>East regional expert (mixture of capitals- and 
<br>Brussels-based).  This was the first time the USG was 
<br>welcomed to address this combined EU expert working group, 
<br>which meets ad hoc to decide on revising EU nonproliferation 
<br>measures against Iran.  Permanent institutional staff 
<br>covering Iran, sanctions, and nonproliferation attended from 
<br>the EU's Commission and Council Secretariat.  The EU's 
<br>Situation Center (SitCen), the community's intelligence 
<br>coordination unit, also sent several representatives. 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (C) Capturing the main sentiment in the room, the Czech 
<br>Presidency expressed gratitude for AA/S Glaser's presentation 
<br> 
<br>BRUSSELS 00000536  003 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>and confirmation that further EU measures "would be 
<br>consistent with the U.S. policy review" as a signal the EU 
<br>"are all waiting for, as this plays an important role in EU 
<br>considerations."  The Czechs and several others noted that 
<br>U.S. information-sharing was conducive to closer 
<br>transatlantic cooperation on Iran policy, predicting this 
<br>would directly influence internal EU debate on pending 
<br>designations of entities and individuals supporting Iran's 
<br>proliferation. 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (C) Betraying some smaller EU states' resentment of the 
<br>EU-3 countries' (UK, France, Germany) prerogatives within the 
<br>Council on Iran policy, Cyprus pointedly thanked the U.S. 
<br>delegation for sharing information with the entire EU "so all 
<br>can take an informed decision," rather than being asked to 
<br>take action through a "leap of faith" when some EUMS have 
<br>information but the rest do not.  "We also welcome that you 
<br>are stressing the dual-track approach," Cyprus added. 
<br>(Comment:  The Cypriot intervention notwithstanding, the 
<br>Czechs took considerable risk just in hosting the U.S. 
<br>presentation.  The EU remains prickly over direct U.S. 
<br>participation in their internal discussions and processes, 
<br>particularly after the bitter divides over Iraq.  The Czechs 
<br>suffered some pushback prior to the event.  End Comment.) 
<br>¶11.  (C) At the conclusion of the briefing, a handful of 
<br>smaller EUMS raised concerns routinely featured in the EU's 
<br>ongoing internal debate over next steps.  (Note: The EU-3 and 
<br>Italy refrained from speaking during the briefing in apparent 
<br>deference to the rest of the membership who do not enjoy 
<br>routine access to U.S. senior Iran policymakers.  End Note.) 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Unintended Consequences? 
<br>------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶12.  (C) Poland, Cyprus, and Portugal asked about the impact 
<br>of current sanctions against Iran on the elite, the broader 
<br>population, and the deteriorating economy.  Is the U.S. 
<br>concerned that further moves could trigger an anti-Western 
<br>backlash?  Could we target political elites without 
<br>victimizing or burdening the general population?  While 
<br>expressing support for targeted measures, Portugal and Cyprus 
<br>worried that strengthening sanctions before Iran's June 
<br>presidential elections could prove counterproductive by 
<br>radicalizing the electorate and leading to Ahmadinejad's 
<br>re-election.  Cyprus flagged comments by Iranian human rights 
<br>activist Shirin Ebadi against sanctions and stressed that it 
<br>want to encourage Iranian moderates.  Portugal asked whether 
<br>the United States has considered Iran's role in the region, 
<br>e.g., Afghanistan, Iraq, and the broader Middle East. 
<br> 
<br>¶13.  (C) AA/S Glaser concurred that these are all important 
<br>questions, but pointed out that the international community 
<br>must choose among a set of bad options in a very compressed 
<br>timeframe.  The international community must convey an urgent 
<br>sense of seriousness -- both to Iran and to other interested 
<br>regional stakeholders in order to change strategic 
<br>calculations and maximize the chance of a diplomatic success. 
<br> By law, U.S sanctions target those engaged in illicit 
<br>conduct, including proliferation and terrorist financing. 
<br>Targeting the Iran's access to the international financial 
<br>system offers the best chance of reducing harm to the average 
<br>population. 
<br> 
<br>¶14.  (C) As to the impact of sanctions, Glaser noted that 
<br>disaggregating the effect of international sanctions and 
<br>Iran's own disastrous economic policies would be nearly 
<br>impossible.  Moreover, sanctions must be examined in the 
<br>context of an overall policy approach and not in isolation. 
<br>A more useful indicator is the perception of Iran's 
<br> 
<br>BRUSSELS 00000536  004 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>decision-makers, who view sanctions as problematic, raising 
<br>business costs, and necessitating evasive behavior:  the 
<br>elite are reacting as if sanctions are having an impact. 
<br> 
<br>Russia and China? 
<br>----------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶15.  (C) The Netherlands asked for U.S. views on the roles of 
<br>Russia and China.  Cyprus referenced the importance of P5 1 
<br>unity to ensure Iran did not circumvent sanctions and promote 
<br>efficacy, adding "UN backing is the best way."  AA/S Glaser 
<br>agreed, but argued that we were already required to implement 
<br>existing UNSCRs.  This situation demanded a nimble response 
<br>to changing conditions, including deceptive practices by 
<br>designated entities.  The U.S. closely consults Russia and 
<br>China, who must play their parts. 
<br> 
<br>What Should the EU Do?  Will U.S. Answer the Mail? 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----- 
<br> 
<br>¶16.  (C) The Netherlands asked what the U.S. explicitly 
<br>wanted from Europe in the diplomatic ("political") track, and 
<br>whether we plan to respond to the Iranian President's earlier 
<br>letters (to former President Bush).  AA/S Glaser referred the 
<br>Dutch to State on matters of diplomacy.  On the sanctions 
<br>front, he noted that the U.S. policy review should not be a 
<br>reason for the EU to stop reviewing its existing sanctions 
<br>for appropriate next steps.  Given the tight timeframe, it 
<br>would be helpful for the EU to make similar designations to 
<br>those already included under existing U.S. sanctions 
<br>authorities. 
<br> 
<br>The Saderat Problem 
<br>------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶17.  (S//NF) In his presentation, AA/S Glaser noted UNSCR 
<br>1803 and EU Common Position identification of Saderat for 
<br>proliferation concerns, but explained that our domestic 
<br>designation falls under U.S. counter-terrorism authorities. 
<br>Although not raised by Member States in the formal briefing, 
<br>several EU contacts (UK, France, Germany, Council Secretariat 
<br>and Czech Presidency) had raised concerns that the EU would 
<br>not be able to act upon the U.S. basis for designation of 
<br>Bank Saderat (support for terrorist activity).  The EU Common 
<br>Position imposing measures against Iran is strictly limited 
<br>to proliferation as a legal basis for inclusion on the list. 
<br>Support for terrorist financing is not grounds for inclusion. 
<br> (Comment: As the additional U.S. information presented was 
<br>exclusively limited to terrorist financing concerns, some 
<br>EUMS are questioning whether a sufficient proliferation basis 
<br>exists for Saderat's inclusion under EU Iran sanctions.  The 
<br>EU does not/not yet have consensus to include Saderat in the 
<br>next round.  End Comment.) 
<br> 
<br>¶18.  (U) AA/S Glaser has cleared this message.
