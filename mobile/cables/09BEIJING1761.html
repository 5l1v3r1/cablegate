<br>POSSIBLE NEXT STEPS FOR CHINA AND WASHINGTON
<br>
<br>Classified By: Deputy Political Section Chief Ben Moeling.
<br>Reasons 1.4 (b/d).
<br>
<br>SUMMARY
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Chinese scholars in recent conversations with PolOff
<br>said that Pyongyang's response to UNSCR 1874 had been "tepid"
<br>so far and that North Korea's domestic political situation
<br>did not appear to be tense.  The DPRK had not anticipated
<br>such a strong reaction to its nuclear test from the
<br>international community, especially from China and Russia.
<br>Several contacts insisted that the Six-Party Talks were "not
<br>dead yet" and remained a good framework to discuss the DPRK
<br>nuclear issue.  Although Seoul and Tokyo would likely urge
<br>Washington to take a harder line on the DPRK, Chinese
<br>scholars urged the United States to take the lead on
<br>resolving the North Korean nuclear problem and not be "led by
<br>the nose" by its treaty allies.  One contact proposed a
<br>U.S.-PRC-Russia trilateral dialogue to generate new ideas on
<br>the future of Northeast Asia.  In light of the threat posed
<br>by North Korea, a former MFA official said China should
<br>strengthen its export control regime and target materials
<br>related to uranium enrichment activities.  He also urged
<br>Washington and Beijing to have a discussion about
<br>strengthening the monitoring of illegal financial activities
<br>during the Strategic and Economic Dialogue.  End Summary.
<br>
<br>UNSCR 1874
<br>----------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Pyongyang's response to UN Security Council Resolution
<br>(UNSCR) 1874 so far, including the June 13 Foreign Ministry
<br>statement and the June 15 mass rally in Pyongyang, had been
<br>"surprisingly tepid," claimed XXXXXXXXXXXX negotiations during a XXXXXXXXXXXX discussion.  Pyongyang's
<br>threats to weaponize plutonium and begin enriching uranium
<br>were "empty threats" and it was clear that North Korea had
<br>run out of leverage.  XXXXXXXXXXXX opined that the DPRK had
<br>miscalculated and had not anticipated that there would be
<br>such a strong reaction to its nuclear test from the
<br>international community, including China and Russia.
<br>Pyongyang, he added, was "scared" of U.S. military pressure.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX noted in a XXXXXXXXXXXX conversation with PolOff
<br>that senior North Korean leaders, including officials from
<br>the influential National Defense Commission, were noticeably
<br>absent from the Pyongyang rally protesting UNSCR 1874 that
<br>had been attended by tens of thousands North Koreans.  This
<br>signaled to XXXXXXXXXXXX that the domestic situation was not that
<br>tense.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Pyongyang, said XXXXXXXXXXXX, was unhappy with China's support
<br>of Resolution 1874.  China would have no problem implementing
<br>UNSCR 1874 but would do so in its "own way," he added.  XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>suggested that China's enforcement would elicit a reaction
<br>from Pyongyang, and recalled that the DPRK Embassy had
<br>complained to him previously about China's strict enforcement
<br>of UNSCR 1718, especially with regard to inspection of
<br>possible dual-use items.  Regarding new restrictions placed
<br>on individual North Koreans, XXXXXXXXXXXX expressed concern that it
<br>would be difficult for Chinese host organizations to confirm
<br>the details of every individual North Korean participating in
<br>a visiting delegation.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX,
<br>urged the United States and other nations not to go beyond
<br>the scope of the resolution.  He noted to PolOff in a XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>conversation that PRC President Hu Jintao had sought to have
<br>a balanced response to the nuclear test by supporting
<br>Resolution 1874 but had failed to fully please Washington or
<br>Pyongyang.
<br>
<br>Future Nuclear or Missile Tests?
<br>--------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Pyongyang would not conduct a third nuclear test
<br>unless absolutely necessary, according  to XXXXXXXXXXXX.  He
<br>predicted that North Korea was more likely to conduct a
<br>missile test, but noted that missile tests were extremely
<br>expensive for the regime.  North Korea's recent nuclear and
<br>missile tests had been possible because the country had had
<br>two consecutive years of good harvests, he speculated.
<br>
<br>Six-Party Talks: "Not Dead Yet"
<br>-------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Several contacts insisted that the Six-Party Talks
<br>remained a good framework to discuss the DPRK nuclear issue.
<br>The Six-Party Talks were not "dead yet," said XXXXXXXXXXXX.  He urged the United States not to set any
<br>preconditions on the DPRK returning to negotiations.  The
<br>United States should be willing to talk to the DPRK so that
<br>Pyongyang did not become "desperate."  The long-term
<br>objective was still denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula
<br>and the medium term aim was to prevent more missile and
<br>nuclear tests and a regional arms race, said XXXXXXXXXXXX.
<br>
<br>Washington Should Take the Lead
<br>-------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Several contacts urged the United States to take the
<br>lead on resolving the DPRK nuclear issue.  Several suggested
<br>it was essential that Washington not be "led by the nose" by
<br>Tokyo and Seoul.  XXXXXXXXXXXX acknowledged that, for understandable
<br>reasons, the ROK and Japan tended to take a harder line on
<br>North Korea.  While the real threat to South Korea posed by
<br>the DPRK nuclear test and missile launches was minimal, he
<br>acknowledged the psychological threat the tests posed to the
<br>ROK, especially to its economy.  While Washington should
<br>certainly consult with Tokyo and Seoul, it should be wary of
<br>being pushed by its allies to take a more strident position.
<br>"Harsh enforcement" of UNSCR 1874 might push Pyongyang to
<br>retaliate, cautioned XXXXXXXXXXXX.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) China was reluctant to be at the forefront of attempts
<br>to resolve this issue, assessed XXXXXXXXXXXX.  Recalling
<br>Beijing's failure to prevent the first DPRK nuclear test in
<br>2006, XXXXXXXXXXXX admitted that China had a credibility issue.  He
<br>expressed hope that Washington could come up with a bold
<br>proposal to break the current deadlock.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX emphasized the importance of China-U.S.
<br>cooperation and suggested that if Washington wanted to engage
<br>in bilateral talks with Pyongyang, Beijing could help
<br>facilitate the engagement and be a mediator.  XXX also
<br>suggested a possible U.S.-PRC-Russia trilateral dialogue on
<br>the future of Northeast Asia as a useful mechanism noting
<br>that all three countries were members of both the Six-Party
<br>Talks and the P5.
<br>
<br>Sustainable Security
<br>--------------------
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX suggested that Sino-American cooperation on the
<br>DPRK issue presented opportunities to address more
<br>fundamental issues such as the concept of "sustainable
<br>security."  XXXXXXXXXXXX noted that the United States, despite having
<br>invested energy, money, and lives on the global war on
<br>terror, had not necessarily increased the security of the
<br>American people.  In the long-term, Beijing and Washington
<br>needed to find ways to guarantee the strategic security of
<br>other countries, including North Korea.  Doing so would
<br>require less investment and offer greater security returns,
<br>he suggested, emphasizing that military power alone would not
<br>resolve the DPRK issue.  Peaceful multilateral processes,
<br>such as the Six-Party Talks, would be more effective, he
<br>concluded.
<br>
<br>Strengthen Export Controls and Financial Sanctions
<br>--------------------------------------------- -----
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX said China was happy to see the adoption of
<br>UNSCR 1874, but he questioned the effectiveness of the
<br>counterproliferation and financial sanctions on the DPRK
<br>regime.  According to XXXXXXXXXXXX, the DPRK had a limited stock of
<br>plutonium, possibly enough for two more bombs, and did not
<br>appear to have a working uranium enrichment program yet.
<br>Thus, he concluded, Washington and Beijing should focus on
<br>preventing the further development of the DPRK's uranium
<br>enrichment program. XXXXXXXXXXXX suggested that China strengthen its
<br>export control regime and target materials that North Korea
<br>might need for its highly enriched uranium (HEU) program.
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX advised that the current level of risk posed by North
<br>Korea's provocative behavior was "affordable" since North
<br>Korea did not have any HEU in the pipeline or have a
<br>sustainable source of fissile material.  However, once
<br>Pyongyang developed its HEU capabilities, the situation would
<br>become much more dangerous and difficult to resolve, warned
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX.
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) On financial sanctions, XXXXXXXXXXXX urged the United States
<br>and China to have a discussion about strengthening the
<br>monitoring of illegal financial activities, possibly
<br>including terrorism finance, corruption, and proliferation
<br>finance during the Strategic and Economic Dialogue (S&ED).
<br>It would be more effective, cheaper and less risky to
<br>intercept financial transactions for proliferation-related
<br>materials, especially since North Korea only had a few
<br>financial outlets, than to enforce the interdiction of
<br>contraband goods, suggested XXXXXXXXXXXX.  The global financial
<br>crisis had spurred international cooperation on financial
<br>matters and Washington and Beijing should take advantage of
<br>this opportunity to enhance the monitoring of illegal
<br>financial transactions.  He emphasized that this type of
<br>monitoring should be done on a global scale, and not simply
<br>targeted at the DPRK, said XXXXXXXXXXXX.
