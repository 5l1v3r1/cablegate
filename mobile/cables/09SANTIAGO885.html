<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: Three recent attacks in Chile's Araucania region,
<br>the heart of indigenous Mapuche territory, have riveted attention
<br>once again on continuing disputes between indigenous groups and the
<br>state in southern Chile. The Coordinadora Arauco Malleco (CAM), a
<br>violent Mapuche group with a history of conducting attacks, claimed
<br>responsibility for recent incidents against trucks, toll plazas and
<br>the police. The GOC claims that small criminal groups are
<br>responsible for the violence and multiple GOC Ministers have
<br>explained that the recent attacks are not connected to larger
<br>indigenous issues. While some believe that the election cycle is
<br>exacerbating the conflict, the violence has yet to emerge as a hot
<br>button topic in the Presidential campaign and President Bachelet's
<br>approval rating remains at a record high level. END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Violence Continues in the Heart of Mapuche Territory
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) The low level conflict in Chile's Araucania region, the
<br>heart of indigenous Mapuche territory, continues to flare, with
<br>several violent attacks in October. The most recent clash took
<br>place on October 20 when a group of seven hooded individuals seized
<br>two trucks, released the drivers, burned the trucks and exchanged
<br>gunfire with members of the Carabineros, Chile's uniformed police.
<br>There are unconfirmed reports that one of the individuals was
<br>wounded but in hiding. A local radio station identified the
<br>individual as a 17-year-old youth who was reportedly not involved
<br>in the attack but hunting in the area when hit by police gunfire.
<br>Other notable events include an October 12 attack on a toll plaza
<br>and an October 18 shooting that left two members of Chile's
<br>investigative police injured. The October violence comes on the
<br>heels of clashes earlier in the year that included the August 12
<br>death of a Mapuche activist, the second fatality in the last two
<br>years (Ref A).
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶3. (U) The Coordinadora Arauco Malleco (CAM), a violent group with
<br>a history of conducting attacks, took responsibility for the recent
<br>violence in an email message to media outlets on October 20. The
<br>CAM also declared war on the Government of Chile (GOC) and its
<br>members renounced their Chilean citizenship.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>GOC: Police Resources are Sufficient, Small Groups of Criminals
<br>are Responsible
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------------------
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Interior Minister Perez Yoma and Secretary General of the
<br>Presidency Jose Viera-Gallo convened a meeting of top regional
<br>officials on October 22 to assess law enforcement efforts. That
<br>meeting took place after Javiera Blanco, Undersecretary of the
<br>Carabineros, rejected hints from the Public Prosecutors' office
<br>that more police forces were needed in the region. Carlos
<br>Fernandez from the National Intelligence Agency told Poloff October
<br>21 that officials have an idea of who is behind the attacks and
<br>hinted that arrests are forthcoming.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) The GOC has tried to separate the recent attacks from the
<br>larger issue of indigenous relations. Viera-Gallo, who was named
<br>coordinator for Indigenous Affairs on August 26, stated that small
<br>criminal groups are responsible the violence. Undersecretary of
<br>Interior Patricio Rosende said the attacks have "nothing to do"
<br>with Mapuche claims. Nevertheless, the GOC invoked a controversial
<br>anti-terrorism law to prosecute four Mapuche individuals who were
<br>allegedly involved in the toll plaza attack. The Pinochet-era law
<br>includes stiffer penalties and restricts the civil liberties of the
<br>accused during investigation and prosecution. Many human rights
<br>activists and international observers say that the government's use
<br>
<br>of the law unfairly targets the Mapuche (Ref A).
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>"This isn't the Capital of Afghanistan"
<br>
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) The GOC has also come under increased criticism from
<br>business leaders in the region. The National Agricultural Society
<br>recently suggested that the rule of law must be re-established in
<br>the region before the GOC pursues development programs that include
<br>land buy-back programs for indigenous communities. Viera-Gallo
<br>flatly rejected the idea that the region is out of control, stating
<br>that the Arauco province "isn't the capital of Afghanistan." He
<br>also chastised government critics for "doing a favor" for the
<br>criminals by exaggerating their capabilities. (Ref B describes how
<br>this conflict has frequently been sensationalized.)
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) Interestingly, the recent violence has not yet emerged as
<br>a hot button issue in the upcoming presidential election. The
<br>three main candidates have discussed issues such as crime and
<br>citizen security, but there has not been a focus on the violence in
<br>the Araucania region or indigenous issues. The violence has also
<br>had no impact on President Bachelet's approval ratings, which
<br>remain at record-high levels. However, some observers believe that
<br>the elections are contributing to the recent uptick in violence,
<br>with the Concertacion government eager to show voters that it is
<br>taking the problem seriously, and Mapuche activists hoping to
<br>pressure the government into concessions before December's voting.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) COMMENT: Despite the most recent outbreaks of violence,
<br>Viera-Gallo is correct to assert that the rule of law remains
<br>intact in the region. While worrying and illegal, the attacks are
<br>sporadic and clearly target property rather than people. The GOC
<br>claim that these attacks are perpetrated by small, criminal groups
<br>may very well be accurate, but that description increases public
<br>perception that the police should be able to identify and arrest
<br>those responsible for the attacks. If the violence continues, the
<br>issue will remain a thorn in the side of the Bachelet
<br>administration - and perhaps its successor. END COMMENT.
