<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: When Spanish Defense Minister Carme Chacon
<br>arrives in Washington June 30, she will be looking among
<br>other things to restore and consolidate her image as the
<br>rising star and heir-apparent of President Zapatero's
<br>cabinet. Since taking office in April 2008, Chacon has
<br>talked of the importance she places on close ties with her
<br>U.S. counterparts and of her desire to go to Washington. The
<br>first woman to head Spain's Ministry of Defense and the first
<br>Minister to give birth while in office, Chacon met with only
<br>one bilateral ambassador, then-U.S. Ambassador to Spain
<br>Eduardo Aguirre, during her 2008 maternity leave (ref F), as
<br>a demonstration of the significance of the bilateral
<br>relationship. Twice nominated and invited previously to
<br>participate in the 2002 and 2003 U.S. International Visitor
<br>Programs, Chacon had up to that point never traveled to the
<br>United States and has yet to do so in an official capacity.
<br>Although well connected and politically savvy, her relative
<br>inexperience in defense issues, particularly in coordination
<br>among NATO allies, has led to mis-steps and put her on the
<br>defensive against opposition attacks in the lead-up to June 7
<br>European Parliament elections. On the eve of her July 1
<br>meeting with Secretary Gates, Chacon has more to prove
<br>domestically than ever before. While the conservative
<br>opposition has used a series of recent faux pas for political
<br>mudslinging, Chacon's personal standing is undiminished, and
<br>in public opinion polls she is held in higher regard than
<br>Zapatero. USG interlocutors should by no means underestimate
<br>her, or the importance ministry places on a successful visit.
<br>While the focus of Chacon's trip will be bilateral issues --
<br>including the U.S.-Spain Agreement on Defense Cooperation
<br>(ADC) and U.S. plans to re-open the KC-30 tanker competition
<br>-- she will review existing operations including Spanish
<br>participation in Afghanistan and in counter-piracy efforts,
<br>as lead in the EU Atalanta mission. She is also expected to
<br>address GOS interest in closer U.S.-EU ties and
<br>civilian-military coordination during Spain's European Union
<br>(EU) Presidency January-June 2010. While in Washington, she
<br>will also lay a wreath at Arlington National Cemetery,
<br>decorate former CJCS Peter Pace and former SACEUR NSA James
<br>Jones, and address the Organization of American States. END
<br>SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>//BILATERAL RELATIONS//
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) U.S.-Spain relations are strong and based on shared
<br>global interests. Spain is an important friend and ally of
<br>the U.S., and we value its cooperation in the fights against
<br>terrorism and narcotics and on security issues. Spain has
<br>approximately 3000 troops deployed in hot spots such as
<br>Afghanistan (over 800), Lebanon (over 1,100), Bosnia
<br>(approximately 260), Indian Ocean / Somalia (over 300),
<br>Kosovo (nearly 500), and in various UN & EU observer
<br>missions. Spain announced at international conferences in
<br>March and April a temporary increase of 450 troops in
<br>Afghanistan to assist with forthcoming elections. Spain has
<br>long fought a domestic terrorist threat from the Basque
<br>terrorist group ETA and suffered tragically from Islamic
<br>extremist terrorism in the 2004 Madrid train bombings. Since
<br>winning a second term in March 2008, but especially since the
<br>U.S. election in November 2008, President Zapatero has
<br>publicly and privately stressed his desire to further improve
<br>bilateral relations, and a strong atmosphere of goodwill has
<br>emerged in Spain for closer bilateral cooperation. As a
<br>gesture of this goodwill, the GOS presently is considering
<br>accepting up to five of the detainees currently held
<br>Guantanamo. Counter-terrorism and law-enforcement
<br>cooperation is strong, as are commercial and cultural
<br>relations (e.g., tourism). Finally, Spain is a leader in
<br>renewable energy technologies and has important investments
<br>in the U.S. in this field (e.g., wind and solar), as well as
<br>in road construction projects. The relationship will be of
<br>
<br>
<br>increasing importance when Spain takes over the EU presidency
<br>in January 2010.
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) Minister Chacon is visiting Washington on the heels
<br>of a very successful visit to Washington by her chief rival
<br>in the cabinet, Interior Minister Rubalcaba, who met with DHS
<br>and DOJ officials as well as intelligence chiefs June 23-24
<br>(ref B). The two visits are but the latest in a series of
<br>high-level exchanges, including a presidential bilateral on
<br>the margins of the U.S.-EU Summit in Prague in April, a
<br>meeting between NSA Jones and King Juan Carlos I in Florida
<br>in February, and Foreign Minister Moratinos's February
<br>meeting in Washington with Secretary Clinton. At the end of
<br>May, U.S. Transportation Secretary LaHood became the first
<br>cabinet-level visitor to Spain on behalf of the Obama
<br>Administration, and Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano
<br>will travel to Madrid while Chacon is in Washington.
<br>
<br>//POLITICAL OVERVIEW//
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) In office since 2004, Zapatero won reelection to a
<br>second term in March 2008, but his center-left Spanish
<br>Socialist Workers Party (PSOE) is seven seats shy of a
<br>majority in the 350-seat Congress. More than a year of
<br>worse-than-expected economic news has led to widespread
<br>criticism of Zapatero and his economic policymakers for
<br>having downplayed the economic difficulties. Although
<br>popularity ratings for Zapatero and the Socialists are low,
<br>the conservative opposition Popular Party (PP) has struggled
<br>to capitalize on this, including by attacking Carme Chacon.
<br>The PP has suffered internal divisions and more recently has
<br>been dogged by corruption accusations. Nevertheless,
<br>Zapatero suffered his first serious political reverse since
<br>winning reelection when his party lost power in March 2009
<br>regional elections in Galicia. Zapatero shuffled the cabinet
<br>April 7 as a response to criticism of the GOS' inability to
<br>resolve the economic crisis and with an eye to the June
<br>European Parliament elections. The most prominent change was
<br>the replacement of the Second Vice President and Minister of
<br>Economy/Finance. Even so, the PP secured more seats than the
<br>Socialists in the June 7 European Parliament elections,
<br>dealing a further blow to Zapatero.
<br>
<br>//DEFENSE TIES//
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) Spain is an excellent defense partner with whom the
<br>United States enjoys robust military-to-military relations
<br>based on cooperation within NATO, the U.S. presence at
<br>Spain's bases (approximately 1335 personnel primarily located
<br>at Naval Station Rota and Moron Air Base), and U.S. Foreign
<br>Military Sales (FMS) to Spain. The southern Spanish bases of
<br>Rota and Moron are strategic hubs, midway between the U.S.
<br>and theaters of operation in Afghanistan and Iraq. U.S.
<br>planes and ships account for approximately 6,000 flights and
<br>200 port calls a year in Spain. Spain remains a leading U.S.
<br>FMS client, with USD $3.2 billion worth of open FMS cases.
<br>The Spanish military, especially the Navy (SPN), is familiar
<br>with U.S. equipment and tactics. The SPN employs the AEGIS
<br>system on its frigates, and is interested in the Joint Strike
<br>Fighter (JSF). At the same time, the Spanish defense
<br>industry is a U.S. supplier, as with the United States Coast
<br>Guard (USCG) purchase of eight EADS-CASA CN-235-300M maritime
<br>patrol aircraft (245 million USD total). Overall, the
<br>Spanish military is pro-U.S. and pro-NATO.
<br>
<br>//CHACON IN THE HOT SEAT//
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) Chacon has been on the defensive against opposition
<br>attacks over her handling of a trifecta of thorny issues in
<br>the past three months. Spain's announced withdrawal of
<br>troops from KFOR in mid-March was widely criticized not for
<br>the substance of the decision so much as for the apparent
<br>lack of coordination -- since refuted by the GOS -- of the
<br>decision internally as well as with NATO Allies (ref C).
<br>Vice President Biden clarified to reporters March 28 in Chile
<br>that the U.S.-Spain bilateral relationship exceeded any
<br>disagreement over Kosovo, and Spanish leaders publicly touted
<br>"absolute (U.S.) understanding of the Spanish decision."
<br>Chacon survived a congressional censure motion brought by
<br>opposition critics over her handling of the withdrawal, which
<br>began the end of April and will be accomplished by the end of
<br>the summer.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) In mid-May, Chacon was again criticized for poor
<br>coordination and inadequate public information regarding an
<br>outbreak of H1N1 flu at a military academy outside Madrid. A
<br>group of school children had been allowed to visit the
<br>installation two days after the first symptoms were reported.
<br>Testifying May 26 in the Spanish Senate and May 27 in the
<br>Congress, Chacon fiercely defended her ministry,s role in
<br>containing the H1N1 outbreak, insisted her ministry had
<br>followed all World Health Organization (WHO) protocols in
<br>coordinating with Spain's Health Ministry, and accused an
<br>opposition questioner of fear-mongering. (NOTE: Spain had
<br>at least 537 confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus by mid-June
<br>(up from 167 at the end of May), making it the most affected
<br>European country by virtue of daily flights from Mexico and
<br>various U.S. points of origin. All the victims are reported
<br>to have mild systems and be responding well to treatment.
<br>Health Minister Trinidad Jimenez announced June 12 her
<br>ministry would not continue to report new cases, in order to
<br>avoid the "numbers dance," since the origin of all the cases
<br>was clear. END NOTE.)
<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU) The H1N1 incident is but one anecdote in a recent
<br>series of opposition attacks on perceived blunders by the
<br>Zapatero Administration in the lead up to European Parliament
<br>elections June 7, in which the Socialists fared poorly. On
<br>June 10, Chacon was forced to make statements denying Spanish
<br>involvement in detention of Israeli spies in Lebanon after a
<br>video conference with Spanish military commanders the
<br>previous week was broadcast by media who had been invited to
<br>film the onset of the meeting. The Defense Ministry later
<br>asserted the arrests were carried out by Lebanese Security
<br>Forces in an area of southern Lebanon controlled by Spanish
<br>troops in coordination with UNIFIL. The conservative
<br>opposition Popular Party continues to allege Chacon knows of
<br>Spanish involvement and has demanded she clarify the GOS's
<br>role in the operations. So far, Chacon seems to have
<br>weathered and learned from the criticism and perhaps come out
<br>stronger for having kept her composure under pressure.
<br>
<br>//CHACON'S WASHINGTON AGENDA//
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Post expects Minister Chacon will use her time with
<br>Secretary Gates to review current Spanish operations and to
<br>place a marker on future discussions of the Agreement on
<br>Defense Cooperation (ADC). She may also raise the long-term
<br>resolution -- important to Spain for supplying its troops in
<br>Afghanistan -- of the Manas Transit Base. Any discussion of
<br>industrial participation or pending defense contracts should
<br>be considered in the context of Spain's budget woes and
<br>severe recession. The latest OECD prediction is that the
<br>Spanish economy will shrink by 4.2 per cent this year and
<br>unemployment is expected to reach 20 per cent by 2010. The
<br>economic slump has the potential to affect political-military
<br>relations inasmuch as the GOS is feeling pressure to prevent
<br>further job losses, including potential cuts in DOD
<br>contracts.
<br>
<br>//AGREEMENT ON DEFENSE COOPERATION//
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) MOD staff do not expect Chacon to discuss the future
<br>of the ADC. If raised, we believe the Defense Minister could
<br>lay out a broad way ahead on this issue, and we understand
<br>her staff has advised her that only minor changes or
<br>technical adjustments are necessary. The current ADC is in
<br>effect until February 2011 and three potential directions
<br>exist: complete re-negotiation, minor improvements, or
<br>continue as is with automatic extension. Secretary General
<br>for Defense Policy (SEGENPOL) Luis Cuesta indicated June 18
<br>to OSD staff Spain's overall satisfaction with the ADC (ref
<br>A). Spanish interlocutors have further advised us even
<br>"improvements" are off the table until the middle of 2010,
<br>once Spain's EU presidency is completed. In fall 2008,
<br>however, Chacon had raised the idea of elevating the status
<br>of the document from an international agreement to treaty
<br>(refs D and E). We believe U.S. efforts and those of her own
<br>staff have dissuaded her of that notion.
<br>
<br>//POSSIBLE CUTBACKS AT ROTA AND MORON//
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Minister Chacon's visit presents an opportunity to
<br>reiterate how much we value the use of Rota and Moron.
<br>
<br>
<br>Access to both bases is an excellent example of a balanced
<br>and mature defense relationship that brings great security
<br>benefits to both our countries and serves as a cornerstone of
<br>the larger bilateral relationship. Nonetheless, the U.S. Air
<br>Force in Europe (USAFE) has been deliberating since 2006 and
<br>is in the final stages of a pre-decisional draft plan to cut
<br>costs at Moron by eliminating several hundred Spanish jobs.
<br>Assuming USAFE pursues the matter, the plan will be
<br>considered by the highest levels of the GOS and could end up
<br>costing a lot more financially and politically than the Air
<br>Force is likely to save annually. Relatively minor labor
<br>issues involving Spanish employees at those bases go straight
<br>to the Presidency. The potential for massive personnel cuts
<br>resulting from cost reductions at Moron and simultaneous
<br>budget cuts at Rota would rise to Zapatero's level. Coupled
<br>with unemployment at 18 per cent and rising -- the highest in
<br>the European Union -- and a severe recession, such changes
<br>could cause a number of problems, the least of which might be
<br>a complete re-look at the ADC. Strikes and lawsuits are
<br>possible. Other possible ramifications of large manpower
<br>cuts include strained relations, anti-American sentiment,
<br>impact on the ease of operations on these bases including
<br>complications for aircraft clearances (currently 6,000/year),
<br>and attempts to mitigate financial losses in the form of
<br>additional taxes and landing fees. DOD should also consider
<br>the potential impact on current military operations of, in
<br>one worst-case scenario, the forced removal by GOS of all
<br>U.S. forces from Moron. The autonomous community where the
<br>bases are located is a key stronghold of the President's
<br>party (indeed, the "governor" of that region was elevated in
<br>April to the President's cabinet). Any attempt in tough
<br>economic times to cut several hundred Spanish contract jobs
<br>at the bases would be controversial and would at a minimum
<br>diminish GOS interest in allowing us continued access. While
<br>we have no indications that Minister Chacon is aware of the
<br>Moron possibility at this time, the Embassy is discussing
<br>scenarios with USAFE and so many people know about the issue
<br>that we should be prepared for the possibility the Spanish
<br>might have gotten wind of it. If and when they do, we should
<br>expect significant political blowback that could bleed over
<br>into other areas of the mil-mil relationship (indeed, into
<br>the entire bilateral relationship).
<br>
<br>//PALOMARES//
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) One issue Chacon might possibly raise is GOS interest
<br>in USG participation in a final cleanup of the Palomares
<br>radiation site that was contaminated in 1966 when three
<br>hydrogen bombs fell near the town of Palomares after a
<br>collision of a USAF B-52 and a USAF refueling tanker
<br>aircraft. The site was cleaned according to standards of the
<br>time, and radioactive soil and vegetation was shipped to the
<br>United States. The Department of Energy has helped fund
<br>health and environmental monitoring for decades, along with a
<br>recently completed GOS study that outlined the considerable
<br>amount of remaining contamination. The Spanish Embassy sent
<br>a diplomatic note in March asking for USG participants in a
<br>working group to define collaboration responsibilities for a
<br>final cleanup. The USG has not responded, and post
<br>understands that DOD is seeking to determine its position.
<br>In reftel G, Post recommended an interagency meeting to
<br>determine a USG response. Minister Chacon has not been
<br>closely involved in the issue in the past, but the Foreign
<br>Ministry's Director General for North American Affairs raised
<br>the issue with EUR A/S Gordon in a recent meeting, and GOS
<br>frustration over the lack of a response to the diplomatic
<br>note may lead Chacon to do so as well.
<br>
<br>//AFGHANISTAN//
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Spain has invested about 300 million Euros in
<br>Afghanistan, including development assistance pledged since
<br>2006 and more recent monetary support pledged since March to
<br>the Election Trust Fund and the ANA Trust Fund. Spanish
<br>officials have also indicated Spain will contribute more
<br>money for infrastructure (road from North-South of RC-W) in
<br>excess of Spain's London Conference pledge (ref A).
<br>Militarily speaking, Spain has deployed more than 800 troops
<br>under ISAF. Spain shares responsibility with the Italians
<br>for a Forward Support Base in Herat, where it has two OMLTs,
<br>and is running a provincial reconstruction team in Qal-e-Now,
<br>in Badghis province. The Spanish have begun construction on
<br>
<br>
<br>a base for the ANA battalion Spain is sponsoring and,
<br>adjacent to that facility, a new facility for the PRT. In
<br>Post's assessment, Spain is doing what it does well, but
<br>could do even more.
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) Minister Chacon testified before the Spanish
<br>Congressional Defense Committee and secured parliamentary
<br>authorization and funding June 17 for Spanish contributions
<br>to the Elections Security Forces (ESF), scheduled to deploy
<br>temporarily in support of Afghan elections for three to four
<br>months. In addition to the 450 temporary troops for the
<br>Afghan elections (to be deployed in mid-July), the Committee
<br>authorized longer-term deployments of 70 guards for Kabul
<br>International Airport and 12 instructors to train the Afghan
<br>National Army. The authorization also included 33 armored
<br>vehicles to increase the total number of Spanish armored
<br>vehicles in Afghanistan to 93. Chacon requested and received
<br>funding for the 450-troop battalion to stay one month beyond
<br>the elections, to allow for a second round of voting, if
<br>necessary. COMMENT: It is possible a company (out of a
<br>battalion to be dedicated to the ESF) may remain in
<br>Afghanistan after the 3-4 month timeframe is completed,
<br>pending the security situation following the elections, when
<br>Spain would determine whether it should or could leave some
<br>of its ESF battalion behind. END COMMENT. Regardless of
<br>what happens with the ESF, Spain will take the lead for
<br>security operations at Kabul International Airport (KAIA)
<br>from the Polish contingent from October 2009 through April
<br>2010, and Spain will provide 40 Civil Guard personnel to
<br>either NTM-A or European Gendarmerie Force (EGF) (ref A).
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) Spanish Chief of Defense GEN Rodriguez met in Kabul
<br>the week of June 22 with COMISAF General McChrystal. Spanish
<br>Joint Staff said the encounter could not have been better,
<br>describing it as "exceptional" and oriented to the future.
<br>Following on what the Spanish perceived to be a fruitful and
<br>positive visit both with COMISAF and with Commander of the
<br>Combined Security and Transition Command - Afghanistan
<br>(CSTC-A), General Formica, this July 1 meeting would be a key
<br>opportunity to ask directly at the highest level to
<br>underscore any stated COMISAF needs and expectations in the
<br>Spanish sector, reinforce military requirements which Spain
<br>could provide, and request Spain demonstrate leadership in
<br>other key areas. Possible opportunities that Spain could
<br>seize, if asked, include: extending promised Spanish
<br>election support in place beyond August 20; lengthening time
<br>between rotations to improve continuity in the regional
<br>command; expansion to the north; not moving Spanish
<br>helicopters from the PRT back to Herat; and following through
<br>on Spain's formalized sponsorship of Colombian troops to
<br>serve alongside Spanish forces in Badghis. If there is no
<br>possibility that the United States will fund airlift for
<br>Colombian troops going to serve with Spain's contingent in
<br>Afghanistan, we should be clear about our expectations and
<br>limitations, in order to avoid any hard feelings over the
<br>potentially earlier arrival of any U.S.-sponsored Colombian
<br>Special Forces.
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) COMMENT: In the lead up to the strategic review of
<br>U.S.-Afghanistan policy, Spanish leadership here in Madrid
<br>stressed that Spain needed to be asked directly and at the
<br>highest level for more support in Afghanistan. Absent a very
<br>direct request to fulfill requirements in RC-West or
<br>elsewhere, Spanish officials can claim to be off the hook.
<br>Even with a high-level political intervention, the Spanish
<br>may resist additional contributions or plead a lack of
<br>Spanish public support for the mission. That being said,
<br>without a high-level discussion, we are nearly certain that
<br>none of the election support forces will stay in ISAF after
<br>the Afghan election. This is our opportunity to tell
<br>Minister Chacon exactly what else Spain could do, at a time
<br>when she needs to maintain the upward trend in her political
<br>standing. After receiving negative press over the Kosovo
<br>withdrawal, Chacon appears to be working consciously on
<br>improving her image and her media posture, and her Washington
<br>schedule positions her for critically important photo
<br>opportunities. We hope she has also learned something about
<br>proper consultation among Allies. Any number of the hot
<br>issues raised here, improperly handled in the current
<br>economic climate, could severely undermine Chacon, erode
<br>expressions of goodwill, and threaten our future operational
<br>effectiveness.
