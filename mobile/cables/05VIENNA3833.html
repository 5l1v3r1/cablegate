<br>SUBJECT: DEMARCHE TO AUSTRIA ON QUESTIONABLE TRANSACTIONS
<br>BY TWO AUSTRIAN BANKS
<br>
<br>REF: STATE 220738
<br>
<br>Classified By: Charge d'Affaires Scott F. Kilner. Reasons: 1.4 (b) an
<br>d (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) On December 7, Charge was able to reach Chancellery
<br>Diplomatic Advisor Hans-Peter Manz by telephone as Manz was
<br>about to leave with the Chancellor for Washington. Charge
<br>presented the unclassified portions of reftel demarche, and
<br>undertook to arrange for the classified portions to reach
<br>Manz in Washington. Manz listened attentively to the points,
<br>and said he would consider them carefully and inform the
<br>Chancellor.
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) In the absence of the Finance Minister, EconPolCouns
<br>and Econ Unit Chief presented reftel points on December 7 to
<br>xxxxx told us that
<br>Austrian authorities welcomed our information, and wanted to
<br>pursue cases that merited further action. They noted that
<br>our list of incidents involved several diverse issues: some
<br>were money laundering cases, some involved terrorist
<br>financing, and others involved proliferation financing. This
<br>involved different enforcement entities and legal frameworks.
<br>xxxxx said they would consult with the various
<br>Austrian agencies with a stake in these cases.
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) Many of the incidents we discussed were well known to
<br>Austrian authorities, according to xxxxx, and in
<br>some cases had been the subject of thorough investigations.
<br>For instance, in the case related to Russian crime boss
<br>Semyon Mogilevich, Austrian authorities had investigated the
<br>Austrian head of Raiffeisen Investment AG in Kiev, but were
<br>unable to prove that he had knowledge of the illegal
<br>transactions. Therefore, Austrian authorities would be
<br>"eager" to receive more evidence on this and other cases.
<br>The Austrian Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), which resides
<br>in the Federal Criminal Office, and the Financial Market
<br>Authority (FMA), which oversees the banking sector, would
<br>welcome concrete evidence, xxxxx said.
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) Some terrorist finance cases concerned entities which
<br>are not on the EU or UN lists, and therefore not subject to
<br>legal sanctions.xxxxx noted that Austria, the
<br>U.S. and Israel had worked for years on the case of the
<br>Palestinian Association of Austria (PVOE), but there was
<br>insufficient evidence to support listing. The PVOE was now
<br>the subject of a pending court case.
<br>
<br>¶5. (S)xxxxx said they would review our list of
<br>cases with a view toward identifying specific information
<br>requests. However, they added that the U.S. Financial Crimes
<br>Enforcement Network (FinCEN) should work closely with the
<br>Austrian FIU to identify concerns. This was especially the
<br>case regarding questions arising from suspicious transactions.
<br>
<br>6, (SBU) Post will continue to pursue this matter with
<br>Austrian financial authorities.
