<br>Classified By: Political Minister-Counselor Josiah Rosenblatt for reaso 
<br>ns 1.4 b and d. 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (C) SUMMARY:  On January 16, Joseph Wood, Deputy 
<br>Assistant to the Vice President for National Security 
<br>Affairs, met with Philippe Errera, strategic affairs adviser 
<br>to FM Kouchner, and Francois Richier, strategic affairs 
<br>adviser to President Sarkozy.  Errera and Richier provided 
<br>their views on NATO, ESDP, Russia, the Iran NIE, and 
<br>President Sarkozy's own guiding principles.  Both advisers 
<br>emphasized that French reintegration into NATO needs thorough 
<br>consideration and is unlikely to take place before 2009. 
<br>They shared their concerns about recent signals from Russia 
<br>and described the "disastrous" consequences of the Iran NIE 
<br>on international efforts.  Finally, they shared their 
<br>perspectives on the principles that underlie President 
<br>Sarkozy's dynamic administration, including France's desire 
<br>to be influential on the world scene while maintaining close 
<br>relations with its allies.  END SUMMARY.

<br>NATO Reintegration -- Not Before 2009 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (C) Both Richier and Errera noted that President Sarkozy 
<br>has publicly accepted the principle of French reintegration 
<br>into NATO.  Furthermore, according to Richier, he is the 
<br>first elected president in France to go on the record as 
<br>supportive of NATO.  The U.S. should not underestimate the 
<br>attitude shifts that have made reintegration politically 
<br>feasible today.  At the same time, both interlocutors 
<br>stressed that the GOF will not "rush" into a final decision 
<br>on reintegration into the military command structure. 
<br>Richier observed that the 2009 NATO summit would be a 
<br>reasonable timeframe for the announcement of a final 
<br>decision, noting the need for a thorough evaluation of the 
<br>implications of the decision.  He added that France's defense 
<br>white paper will include a vision for French and collective 
<br>security, but that the exercise will conclude no sooner than 
<br>the end of April 2008. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C) Errera said the GOF prefers the term "normalization" 
<br>to "reintegration," in part to underscore for domestic 
<br>political reasons that the NATO of today is not the NATO of 
<br>previous eras.  Errera said that President Sarkozy wants to 
<br>work for a "new" NATO, and that France needs to be on the 
<br>inside to work for reform.  He stressed that use of the 
<br>correct terminology should help frame the public dialogue 
<br>that is certain to ensue in France, despite the lack of 
<br>public outcry responding to Sarkozy's initial expressions of 
<br>interest.  Richier noted that there is much ignorance in 
<br>France today about what NATO does; for example, many think 
<br>ISAF is under UN auspices.  Errera pointed out that the 
<br>defense white paper commission, which is conducting a broad 
<br>review of defense and security policy, includes people who 
<br>are skeptical of NATO. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (C) Errera characterized this moment as "awkward," given 
<br>that formal discussions about the form of French 
<br>reintegration have not yet started.  He noted that political 
<br>commitment and practical considerations had to be developed 
<br>simultaneously and incrementally, adding that the Joint 
<br>Chiefs must have a sense for where in NATO French officers 
<br>would be posted, for example, before a decision is made. 
<br>Most importantly, he said that France (including Sarkozy's 
<br>diplomatic adviser Jean-David Levitte) wants to avoid the 
<br>same mistakes that were made in the 1990s when reintegration 
<br>was last on the table.  To avoid repeating those mistakes, 
<br>Errera said smaller, practical questions should not be 
<br>permitted to become pressure points that could block a 
<br>political decision.  Richier said that it would be a mistake 
<br>to set firm goals today on what had to be achieved before a 
<br>political decision could be made, and that the overall 
<br>direction is more important than the specifics.  He 
<br>acknowledged that there is suspicion in Europe regarding 
<br>France's motivations, and suspicion in France regarding NATO, 
<br>that will need to be overcome.  He pointed to President 
<br>Sarkozy's scheduled February 1 meeting with NATO SYG Jaap de 
<br>Hoop Scheffer as one important step to alleviate some 
<br>concerns. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (C) Errera said that generally, newer members of NATO 
<br>will view French reintegration positively, reducing their 
<br>current suspicion of France for its non-normalized NATO 
<br>membership.  On the other hand, newer members of NATO use 
<br>NATO jobs to reward their top leadership, and French 
<br>

<br> 
<br> 
<br>reintegration would put a tight squeeze on command structures 
<br>and high-level posts.  High-level positions are also an issue 
<br>with Germany and the U.K.

<br> 
<br>¶6.  (C) Errera stated that during France's upcoming EU 
<br>Presidency, President Sarkozy will push hard to strengthen 
<br>European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP), while working 
<br>for a revitalized NATO.  Richier called this a transatlantic 
<br>effort to strengthen European security, while noting that 
<br>billing it as an "alternative" to NATO would be both 
<br>politically and financially absurd.  Errera observed that 
<br>substantive progress on ESDP will be very difficult, partly 
<br>due to British concerns.  Richier expressed hope that 
<br>European defense budgets could increase, noting that the gap 
<br>vis--vis the U.S. is growing, but added that if budgets 
<br>cannot be increased in the short term, efficiency must be 
<br>increased.

<br> 
<br>¶7.  (C) Adriatic 3:  Errera said that France is comfortable 
<br>in principle with each of the Adriatic 3 candidates.  In 
<br>particular, France has "no problems" with Croatian 
<br>membership.  However, Errera said Albania seems to be taking 
<br>acceptance for granted, and needs to make more of an effort 
<br>to "clean up" corruption issues.  Regarding Macedonia, Errera 
<br>said the GOM underestimates the seriousness of the name issue 
<br>for Greece and that the U.S. should not make the same 
<br>mistake.  France will not pressure Greece on this issue. 
<br>Furthermore, if Athens were to give in on the name issue, the 
<br>Greek government could fall, thus bringing in a new 
<br>government which would be responsible for -- and presumably 
<br>hostile to -- the NATO enlargement ratification progress. 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (C) Georgia and Ukraine:  Errera said that the GOF does 
<br>not want a public dispute with the U.S. on these issues 
<br>before Bucharest, adding that European allies are hedging 
<br>because Washington is not sending clear signals.  Errera 
<br>expects that new Ukrainian PM Tymoshenko will come out soon 
<br>publicly in favor of MAP for Ukraine, a step for which France 
<br>will "not have a great appetite."  Errera said MAP is not 
<br>just one more step in closer relations, but a serious 
<br>decision in light of Article 5 commitments.  Regarding 
<br>Georgia, he said Saakashvili "pulled off the election 
<br>somehow" but still not under ideal circumstances, and that 
<br>NATO may not be ready for Article 5 guarantees to Georgia 
<br>either.  That said, the GOF has systematically made clear to 
<br>Russia that there is no Russian redline or veto regarding 
<br>Ukraine and Georgia.  In response, Wood noted that France's 
<br>hesitation regarding Article 5 commitments implies a de facto 
<br>"sphere of influence," because Russia is the only possible 
<br>menace to Ukraine or Georgia.

<br> 
<br>¶9.  (C) Richier characterized the current Russian regime as 
<br>revisionist, saying that Putin made much-needed improvements 
<br>to Russian infrastructure but has gone too far in seeking to 
<br>restore Russia's grandeur at the expense of international 
<br>cooperation and development.  Among the Russian population, 
<br>many are culturally and economically oriented towards the 
<br>West, but remain politically tied to Putin.  According to 
<br>Errera, Russian judgment on important issues is worsening. 
<br>In the past, Russia has been difficult to work with, but has 
<br>ultimately made the right decisions -- until recently.  As an 
<br>example, in President Sarkozy's private meeting in Moscow 
<br>with President Putin, Putin was very hardline on Iran 
<br>(notwithstanding Russia's exports of fuel for Bushehr), but 
<br>that in the subsequent press conference, Putin distanced 
<br>himself on this issue, to Sarkozy's surprise and chagrin. 
<br>Errera said that in the past, Russia did not mind hurting 
<br>Iran as long as Russia was not hurt as well; now Russia seems 
<br>not to want to hurt the Iranians.

<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (C) Both interlocutors noted that France's use of 
<br>nuclear energy makes it less dependent than some other 
<br>European countries on Russian oil and gas.  That said, 
<br>Richier expressed concern that Russia is "grabbing" gas 
<br>infrastructure and supply at a time of military buildup and 
<br>strong rhetoric.  He said that it will be difficult for 
<br>Europe to agree on a common energy policy, as there is 
<br>currently no consensus, nor any great ideas, on how to solve 
<br>the problem.  Richier described Russian policies as motivated 
<br>to obtain short-term profit for individuals, rather than to 
<br>build long-term, worldwide power.  Errera observed that 
<br>dependence on Russia for energy is better than dependence on 
<br>Iran, which is the only other real option.  He said that 
<br>Sarkozy had made overtures to Algeria on gas before and 
<br>during his visit to Algiers, but that France was "stiffed." 
<br>Nor is there any sense that there will be progress with 
<br>Algeria on gas in the near term.  Errera said that while 
<br>France seeks a commercial relationship, Algeria views energy 
<br>cooperation as complicated by history and tinged with a sense 
<br>of nationalism.

<br>NIE:  "The Best Christmas Gift Ahmadinejad Could Have 
<br>Imagined" 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>- 
<br> 
<br>¶11.  (C) Both interlocutors called the NIE a "disaster" that 
<br>has "substantially jeopardized" progress on Iran in the short 
<br>term and will have lasting consequences, including 
<br>eliminating France's ability to build consensus in Europe. 
<br>French views are unchanged, but many others have been 
<br>affected, and the NIE destroyed not just the momentum of the 
<br>international community but also what little leverage France 
<br>and the international community had on less radical Iranian 
<br>elements.  Errera noted that the timing of the release of the 
<br>NIE was especially bad, with EU Political Directors having 
<br>been poised for a new UNSC resolution just before the NIE 
<br>release.  He said at the IISS Manama Dialogue in December, 
<br>speculation was rampant about why the current U.S. 
<br>administration did not better manage the report's fallout by 
<br>postponing its release or changing the characterization of 
<br>Iran's enrichment activities as exclusively civil. 
<br> 
<br>¶12.  (C) Both interlocutors said quick passage of a new UNSC 
<br>resolution, although likely to be a weak, is key.  Richier 
<br>said that Iran has no incentive to negotiate and that the 
<br>international community's most effective mechanism has been 
<br>creating a financially difficult operating environment for 
<br>Iran.  If the perception declines in the financial community 
<br>that investment in Iran is dangerous, this will change. 
<br>Errera noted the EU might be able to go farther than the 
<br>Security Council will, perhaps with Gulf countries and/or the 
<br>G7, to pressure Iran on continued uranium enrichment by 
<br>raising the price for doing so. 
<br> 
<br>¶13.  (C) Errera also said that an intelligence team from the 
<br>French DGSE traveled to the U.S. recently to meet with their 
<br>U.S. counterparts regarding the NIE, and was disappointed 
<br>that the information shared was "even less" than has been 
<br>reported in the press.  This reception did not help the 
<br>perception shared by some in the GOF that France has not been 
<br>treated as a full partner by the U.S., despite working 
<br>side-by-side and fielding criticism following the NIE 
<br>release.

<br>Sarkozy's Governing Philosophy 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br> 
<br>¶14.  (C) Errera said that two clear priorities underlie 
<br>Sarkozy's administration.  The first is realigning French 
<br>presence with French objectives, and reestablishing French 
<br>influence where it had been diminished (for example, within 
<br>the EU, by giving momentum to the simplified EU treaty). 
<br>Errera said France will maintain its influence in Africa but 
<br>seeks to rebalance its overseas investments, for example by 
<br>creating a military base in the UAE.  Errera said that France 
<br>cannot say Iran is a key threat without investing more in the 
<br>Gulf and that the Iranians will "get the message."  He noted 
<br>that the new base in the UAE will be the first French 
<br>military installation not in a former colony.  Secondly, 
<br>Errera said that Sarkozy believes in the concept of "the 
<br>West," making him the first non-Gaullist French president not 
<br>to consider France an exclusively independent actor.  This 
<br> 
<br>PARIS 00000114  004 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>identification provides Sarkozy a clear course for steering 
<br>French policy even on difficult questions like dealing with 
<br>Libyan President Qadhafi. 
<br> 
<br>¶15.  (C) Richier suggested that Sarkozy's core conviction is 
<br>that France must be pulled into the 21st century.  He said 
<br>Sarkozy likes to use the metaphor of a person who exercises 
<br>for the first time in a while -- many muscles may be sore 
<br>afterwards, but the exercise has done them good.  Richier 
<br>said he sees new energy in French diplomacy, focused on 
<br>bringing diversity and reconciliation to the global stage. 
<br>Sarkozy wishes to encourage countries to accept the diversity 
<br>(ethnic, religious, etc.) within their own societies, as 
<br>tolerance for others is key to democracy.  Sarkozy also 
<br>recognizes a need for reconciliation and believes the effort 
<br>to correct the course of a "bad guy" is worthwhile (COMMENT: 
<br>In public Sarkozy has defended his outreach to Qadhafi and 
<br>Hugo Chavez along these lines.)  According to Richier, 
<br>Sarkozy believes the short-term costs of talking to rogue 
<br>actors by using carrots and helping them move forward are 
<br>less than the long-term costs of inaction.  However, he also 
<br>recognizes the importance of not creating gaps between the 
<br>U.S. and Europe in reaching out to "bad guys," marking a 
<br>departure from previous French governments.  Finally, Richier 
<br>noted that "relations with Islam" and climate change were two 
<br>immediate priorities of President Sarkozy's that would 
<br>nevertheless remain on the French agenda.
