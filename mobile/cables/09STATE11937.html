<br>SUBJECT: (U) Secretary Clinton's February 5, 2009 
<br>expanded meeting with French Foreign Minister Bernard 
<br>Kouchner 
<br>
<br>CLASSIFIED BY EUR ASSISTANT SECRETARY MARCIE RIES, 
<br>ACTING FOR REASONS 1.4 (D) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) SUMMARY: Secretary Clinton and French Foreign 
<br>Minister Bernard Kouchner met on February 5 for 30 
<br>minutes in their first bilateral meeting. The warm and 
<br>open exchange followed a one-on-one working lunch and 
<br>preceded a 20-minute press conference. The two agreed 
<br>to coordinate closely on a wide range of issues 
<br>including the Middle East, Afghanistan, Iran, Russia, 
<br>the Balkans, GTMO detainees and Africa, especially 
<br>Darfur. On Afghanistan, Kouchner emphasized the need 
<br>for greater "Afghanization" and international "access" 
<br>to everyday Afghan people, and asked for U.S. support to 
<br>hold a second "Neighbors" conference to follow up on the 
<br>initial December 14, 2008 event. On GTMO, the FM 
<br>indicated Europe would help on a case-by-case basis, and 
<br>asked the U.S. for assistance with a 15-year old 
<br>Canadian national, Omar Khadr. The FM asked for a 
<br>reaction to its Transatlantic paper, passed to the U.S. 
<br>during France's 2008 EU presidency. As the meeting 
<br>closed, the Secretary joked that the FM was "not even in 
<br>her league" concerning criticism when the FM mentioned a 
<br>new book critical of him that might spark press 
<br>questions. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>----------- 
<br>Middle East 
<br>----------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) The Secretary opened the meeting by welcoming FM 
<br>Kouchner and expressing appreciation for French 
<br>leadership on a broad agenda of cooperation, which she 
<br>said President Obama hoped to deepen. Kouchner 
<br>congratulated the Secretary and said he looked forward 
<br>to the pleasure of working together on a first name 
<br>basis. The two then summarized topics discussed in 
<br>their one-on-one meeting, beginning with the Middle 
<br>East. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) The Secretary said she understood that the issue 
<br>of the Middle East was of grave concern to France. She 
<br>expressed appreciation for French leadership on 
<br>interdicting weapons into Gaza and with the Copenhagen 
<br>process. She thanked President Sarkozy for his ideas 
<br>and for French work in providing assistance to the 
<br>people of Gaza. FM Kouchner said that he had met with 
<br>Palestinian Authority (PA) PM Abu Mazen three days prior 
<br>and found him completely isolated. There was a game 
<br>being played among Arabs, most of whom, Egyptians 
<br>excepted, did not care. He said "Abbas is lost. You 
<br>tried, we tried but nothing has happened. The key, he 
<br>said, was to figure out how to build up Abu Mazen in a 
<br>government of national unity. Salam Fayyad was a 
<br>fantastic PM who had ideas about how to open the Gaza 
<br>crossing, specifically a tax paid by a group of people 
<br>who would be acceptable to both sides just to get the 
<br>crossing operating." It was especially important, he 
<br>continued, to offer the Palestinian people a sign that 
<br>the crossing was open because of Abu Mazen's 
<br>involvement. He had to be seen as a leader. He said it 
<br>would take weeks and noted that Hamas does not want to 
<br>talk to Mazen. Still, it was important to help convince 
<br>the Israelis to open the crossing. Kouchner cautioned 
<br>that it would be difficult to get anything done ahead of 
<br>the Israeli election on February 10. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) The Secretary concurred that the situation was 
<br>difficult. She added that confidence building measures 
<br>were needed so that the Israelis would feel committed. 
<br>It was important to persuade the new Israeli government 
<br>to participate in the peace effort and be convinced that 
<br>they could work with the PA. If Abu Mazen's government 
<br>of national unity is to work, Israel needs to understand 
<br>that it should work with him and that this development 
<br>could help. She was encouraged by the actions that the 
<br>Egyptians had taken against the tunnels. She said there 
<br>was much to coordinate and supported the role of the 
<br>Quartet, but agreed that little could happen in advance 
<br>of the Israeli elections. She noted that the U.S. was 
<br>conducting a review based on Mitchell's work. 
<br>
<br>----------- 
<br>Afghanistan 
<br>----------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) The Secretary said that the U.S. was working on 
<br>a comprehensive strategy and thanked the FM for France's 
<br>contributions and cooperation. Kouchner noted that 
<br>France had increased its troops to 3000 from 3300. He 
<br>said there was progress in several areas, including 
<br>civil society, but presented a mixed picture overall. 
<br>He returned several times to problems with access to the 
<br>population and suggested that this was the key. He also 
<br>promoted Afghanization, saying it was important "for the 
<br>people to take their own problems into their own hands." 
<br>He expressed pride in the French hospital in Kabul as an 
<br>example of what was possible noting that Afghan patients 
<br>were being treated by Afghan doctors, and even the 
<br>Taliban presented themselves for treatment. He said 
<br>that Kabul is not Afghanistan, but that Kabul works 
<br>because it has been "Afghanized." The rest of the 
<br>country needs the same, but it will take years. He was 
<br>also concerned about growing Iranian influence, noting 
<br>that a huge Shi'a mosque had recently been built with 
<br>Iranian funds. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) FM Kouchner asked for the Secretary's support 
<br>for a follow-up event to the December 14, 2008 
<br>"Afghanistan Neighbors conference" that Kouchner hosted 
<br>in Paris. The FM said the meeting had been very 
<br>interesting, despite the Iranians not showing at the 
<br>last minute, and should be repeated if the U.S. agreed. 
<br>Kouchner put the conference in the context of a broader 
<br>approach, stressing "there is no military solution in 
<br>Afghanistan." 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) The Secretary took note of the proposal, but 
<br>made no commitment on a follow-up conference. She said 
<br>the U.S. believed that there had been some success with 
<br>building the Army, but more problems with the police. 
<br>Both commented on the strength of the new Minister of 
<br>Interior. The Secretary said that the Minister of the 
<br>Interior was an interesting person but that it might be 
<br>necessary to deal with some of the more radical people 
<br>whether we wanted to or not. On reconciliation, 
<br>Kouchner said that there were some very bad people 
<br>involved, but they were nationals of Afghanistan and it 
<br>was important to start negotiations, including the 
<br>negotiations in Saudi Arabia. Finally on the 
<br>presidency, Kouchner said "Karzai is somebody. We have 
<br>to talk to him, but there may be other candidates." He 
<br>said Anwar-ul-Haq Ahadi was such a person but, while 
<br>interesting, he probably couldn't win against Karzai. 
<br>The Secretary noted that Richard Holbrooke would travel 
<br>to the region. 
<br>
<br>----------- 
<br>GUANTANAMO 
<br>----------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) The Secretary expressed appreciation for French 
<br>leadership within the EU on this issue. She said she 
<br>was proud of President Obama's commitment to close the 
<br>facility, calling it "a cancer" the U.S. wanted to take 
<br>care of, but would take time. She said this was 
<br>complicated, so we were asking friends and allies to 
<br>consider taking some detainees. FM Kouchner said the EU 
<br>27 had not yet reached consensus, but that they 
<br>"accepted the idea," but would consider detainees on a 
<br>case-by-case basis; Europeans do not want to create 
<br>legal problems for themselves. They were working with 
<br>three categories of individuals. First were "the best 
<br>cases." Second, were those who had made individual 
<br>requests for resettlement in specific countries and 
<br>third without legal problems. There were many 
<br>outstanding questions, such as whether they had refugee 
<br>status, but because of the Schengen visa requirements, 
<br>it was necessary for the EU to address this together. 
<br>At the end of this discussion, the FM handed the 
<br>Secretary a paper concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year old 
<br>Muslim of Canadian origin. The Secretary agreed to 
<br>review the case.

<br>Iran 
<br>---- 
<br>
<br>¶9. (S/NF) The Secretary opened the discussion by 
<br>alluding to the private conversation with FM Kouchner 
<br>and their agreement that it was important to prevent 
<br>further development of Iran's nuclear capabilities and 
<br>its missile program. Iran's recent space launch 
<br>complicated this effort noting that the Iranians had 
<br>respected none of the internationally recognized 
<br>requirements for a space launches specified in UN 
<br>Security Council resolutions. The FM said he welcomed 
<br>the U.S. willingness to consider direct talks between 
<br>the U.S. and Iran. He said that the Iranians were 
<br>waiting for the U.S. The launch had surprised the 
<br>Russians, of whom he said "they are more affected than 
<br>we being 2000 kilometers closer." He added that the 
<br>sanctions seemed to be having some effect on the 
<br>domestic population, but he ended by repeating the need 
<br>for a Quartet meeting. He said that it was important 
<br>for any approach to be done together with the Germans 
<br>and the Russians, particularly since the Russians are 
<br>closer to Iran and could be more easily targeted. 
<br>Kouchner suggested not including the Chinese because the 
<br>Chinese are "absolutely not useful" in this process. 
<br>The Secretary said it was important to follow up, 
<br>possibly with U.K. Foreign Secretary David Miliband on 
<br>the margins of the G-20 Summit in London. 
<br>

<br>Russia/Georgia/Energy 
<br>--------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) FM Kouchner told the Secretary that France had 
<br>been surprised by the Georgian invasion. "We did stop 
<br>it, but we didn't solve it." He continued that the 
<br>South Ossetians and Abkhaz are a "sort of independent 
<br>people" but he worried that there is no humanitarian 
<br>access to the population. He said that Georgian PM 
<br>Saakashvili had been "badly inspired; he fell into the 
<br>trap." But the FM said the Geneva process should 
<br>continue, though it might take months or years. On 
<br>energy, he said the EU had been united, but then Poland, 
<br>Romania and others had been completely cut off and that 
<br>both Russia and Ukraine had been "absolutely awful." He 
<br>said "a group of Europeans were trying to secure a 
<br>pipeline from one country to the other." But he 
<br>cautioned that the U.S. position on Missile Defense was 
<br>also a factor. He complimented Medvedev as "a normal 
<br>guy, at least better than Putin," and credited him with 
<br>what he believed to be the sound decision not to put 
<br>Iskander missiles in Kalinigrad. He said things were 
<br>now more complicated with the Iranian space launch. On 
<br>the whole, things were frozen, which was "not bad" as a 
<br>place to be for the moment. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Continuing on Russia, Kouchner said that the 
<br>main thing for the U.S. and Russia to begin to work 
<br>together. "Let's talk to them," he said. He said that 
<br>the Russians are "rough, rude, and brutal," but we 
<br>should still engage them. Kouchner said Russian FM 
<br>Lavrov was one of the most brutal, but was among the 
<br>cleverest FMs. In any case, they were an important 
<br>player and had to be included. 
<br>

<br>Balkans 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) FM Kouchner said that Bosnia remained a 
<br>problem, but, it was important to simply "follow the 
<br>road." It was important to push the Serbian government 
<br>closer to the EU, though he conceded this was difficult 
<br>due to Dutch and Belgian objections to the failure of 
<br>the Serbs to hand over Ratko Mladic to ICTY. Presumably 
<br>referring to EULEX, he said there was success on the 
<br>ground in Kosovo as the two sides were not killing each 
<br>other and concluded that things were not in a bad place 
<br>for the moment. 
<br>
<br>------ 
<br>Darfur 
<br>------ 
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) FM Kouchner told the Secretary he thought the 
<br>International Criminal Court (ICC) would soon issue an 
<br>arrest warrant against Sudanese President Omar al- 
<br>Bashir. He complimented the Qataris for playing a 
<br>useful role with their work in Doha. He said they were 
<br>working with both sides, including the Islamists. He 
<br>said it had taken two years to build toward success. 
<br>EUFOR, a contingent of 17 nations deployed in Eastern 
<br>Chad and northern Central African Republic, was a 
<br>success and he expected a resolution before March 15 
<br>when EUFOR will hand over its responsibilities to the UN 
<br>(MINURCAT II). On the humanitarian front, he estimated 
<br>that half of the displaced persons in Eastern Chad, 
<br>mainly women, would begin coming home in Darfur by March 
<br>¶15. 
<br>
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>Book and Transatlantic Paper 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶14. (SBU) As the meeting ended, the Secretary said 
<br>there was a lot to digest and do. It would require 
<br>cooperation. On a lighter note, FM Kouchner said that 
<br>waiting journalists might raise the issue of "The World 
<br>According to K," the expose published yesterday accusing 
<br>him of enriching himself as a consultant in Africa, 
<br>tarnishing his humanitarian image. The Secretary 
<br>dismissed the book, saying "One book? I have 25. 
<br>You're not even in my league!" He said that "the first 
<br>one hurts a little more than the others." The FM asked 
<br>the Secretary for US reaction to the Transatlantic paper 
<br>passed to the U.S. during the French presidency. The 
<br>Secretary said she would review the issue and respond. 
<br>Note: EUR passed the paper to S staff on 2/5/09 and is 
<br>preparing a response to the FM). End note.
