<br>SUBJECT: SPAIN: TIME TO DEFROST THE DEEP FREEZE?
<br>
<br>Classified By: Charge d'Affaires J. Robert Manzanares; reasons 1.4 (B)
<br>and (D).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary. After a tumultuous year in our bilateral
<br>relations with Spain, the Mission is considering how best to
<br>establish a more productive relationship with the Zapatero
<br>administration. The GOS scored early political points with
<br>the Spanish public by withdrawing Spanish forces from Iraq,
<br>attacking USG policy in Iraq, and breaking with the previous
<br>government's emphasis on transatlantic relations. More
<br>recently, however, the GOS has recognized the high domestic
<br>and international cost of its confrontational approach
<br>towards the USG and has made clear its desire to improve
<br>bilateral ties. We have insisted that such sentiments be
<br>backed up with actions, and the GOS responded by agreeing to
<br>participate in a PRT in Afghanistan, providing funds for the
<br>Iraq elections, agreeing to train Iraqi security officials in
<br>Spain, and toning down their criticism of USG foreign policy.
<br>In return for these gestures, the Zapatero Government is
<br>hoping for USG acknowledgement that ties are on the mend,
<br>preferably through the positive optics that would be
<br>generated by high-level meetings in Washington.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) We believe it makes sense to lock in the gains of the
<br>last two months by publicly recognizing Spain's positive
<br>steps, as we did through the meeting between Secretary
<br>Rumsfeld and DefMin Bono in Nice. We also suggest moving
<br>forward on areas of particular bilateral importance, such as
<br>counter-terrorism cooperation. Minister of Interior Jose
<br>Antonio Alonso and Minister of Justice Juan Fernando Lopez
<br>Aguilar have both requested meetings in Washington in early
<br>2005 for counter-terrorism discussions with USG counterparts
<br>and the country team strongly supports these requests.
<br>Similarly, we should encourage stronger military to military
<br>relations and commercial ties. Important differences remain
<br>with the Zapatero government, including his overtures to Cuba
<br>and Venezuela and Spain's continuing refusal to allow Spanish
<br>forces assigned to NATO commands to participate in operations
<br>in Iraq. We have also been frustrated by the sometimes
<br>erratic and uncoordinated nature of the Socialist
<br>administration, as demonstrated by the confusion surrounding
<br>DefMin Bono's recent visit to Venezuela.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Despite these lingering concerns, we believe the time
<br>is right for calibrated re-engagement with the GOS in the
<br>hope that we can establish a greater degree of influence on
<br>GOS policy and, when possible, steer them towards a more
<br>positive course. Zapatero's domestic position has
<br>strengthened over the last year and his approval rating of
<br>63% suggests we will be dealing with his government for
<br>several years to come, so it is in our interest to improve
<br>the working relationship with him. Alternatively, USG snubs
<br>could trigger a nationalist backlash in Spain and encourage
<br>Zapatero to withhold cooperation with USG initiatives. End
<br>Summary.
<br>
<br>//A Tough Year//
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) The first ten months of the Zapatero administration
<br>have proven among the most difficult periods in U.S.-Spanish
<br>relations in many years. Throughout the most frustrating
<br>episodes, the USG won points for sticking to the high road
<br>and refusing to be baited into public disputes with the GOS.
<br>Despite our efforts to keep productive ties on track, senior
<br>GOS officials continued to make unhelpful remarks throughout
<br>2004, particularly with respect to the U.S. role in Iraq.
<br>There was also friction regarding regional issues, such as
<br>Spain's leadership of an effort to ease EU restrictive
<br>measures against Cuba and Zapatero's engagement of Chavez in
<br>Venezuela. Though Zapatero drew massive public support for
<br>his decision to withdraw Spanish troops from Iraq (and his
<br>public approval rating remains high at 63%), he has been
<br>criticized for subsequent missteps that have soured relations
<br>with Washington.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) The turning point in Zapatero's approach to the U.S.
<br>came when Ambassador Argyros declined to attend the October
<br>12 national day parade, putting the public spotlight on our
<br>disappointment with the tone and direction of Spanish foreign
<br>policy. This episode undermined GOS assertions in the press
<br>that U.S.-Spanish ties had not suffered as a result of
<br>Spain's withdrawal from Iraq and forced the Zapatero
<br>administration to acknowledge tensions in one of Spain's most
<br>important bilateral relationships. While polls consistently
<br>demonstrate widespread hostility among Spaniards towards U.S.
<br>foreign policy, particularly in the Middle East, the public
<br>still expects the GOS to maintain healthy working relations
<br>with Washington. The U.S.-Spanish rift left Zapatero open to
<br>withering opposition criticism that he had ruined that
<br>relationship and relegated Spain to second-class status in
<br>foreign affairs.
<br>
<br>//Spain Looking to Repair Relations//
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Since November, GOS officials at all levels have made
<br>clear their desire to restore strong bilateral ties, most
<br>recently when the MFA's Director General for Foreign Policy
<br>(Under Secretary for Political Affairs equivalent) told
<br>Charg bluntly, "We want back in." In responding to these
<br>overtures, we have noted that the Spanish Government's
<br>positions and public commentary since Zapatero took office
<br>have generated significant skepticism within the USG
<br>regarding Spain's readiness to work with us on the issues
<br>that matter most, such as in the War on Terrorism. We told
<br>our GOS interlocutors that we were prepared to move ahead on
<br>issues of mutual importance and that unambiguous, positive
<br>actions by Spain would be the best signal to the U.S.
<br>Government that Spain too was ready to get past our
<br>differences.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) In the last several weeks, the GOS has undertaken a
<br>series of measures that appear aimed at improving relations
<br>with the USG. The most important of these is Spain's
<br>decision (not yet made public) to lead a Provincial
<br>Reconstruction Team and contribute to a forward support base
<br>in western Afghanistan (after months of prodding by USG
<br>officials, including numerous Embassy demarches). Spain has
<br>taken other actions as well. The Spanish Government
<br>contributed $20 million to the Iraq elections (part of its
<br>$300 million pledge made during the 2003 Iraq Donors
<br>Conference) and issued a positive public assessment of the
<br>elections themselves. Prior to the vote, Spain had, at the
<br>USG's request, engaged Arab governments to urge them to press
<br>Iraqi Sunnis to participate in the elections. The GOS also
<br>deployed King Juan Carlos to transmit positive messages, such
<br>as the King's January 13 declaration at a reception for the
<br>Madrid diplomatic corps that the U.S. was a "fundamental
<br>point of reference for Spanish foreign policy" and that the
<br>GOS desired "improved bilateral ties at every level."
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) The Embassy has welcomed these gestures, while making
<br>clear to our GOS counterparts that we are still troubled by
<br>mixed signals on issues we thought had been resolved. For
<br>example, Zapatero canceled a planned stop in Caracas to meet
<br>with Chavez at our urging, but then dispatched Defense
<br>Minister Bono on a "secret" trip to Venezuela to promote
<br>sales of military and civilian equipment. Also, on Iraq, FM
<br>Moratinos and other government and Socialist party figures
<br>still occasionally refer to the conflict as an "illegal war"
<br>and have joined like-minded EU leaders in pressing for a
<br>timetable for the U.S. to withdraw troops by the end of 2005.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Some issues, notably Cuba and to a lesser degree
<br>Venezuela, will likely remain points of friction in the
<br>bilateral relationship. The driving force behind Spanish
<br>overtures to Castro and Chavez is a combination of the
<br>Socialists, desire to satisfy left-wing constituents who
<br>remain attached to romantic notions of Latin American
<br>revolutionary movements and a naive faith in Spain's ability
<br>to influence the two leaders in a positive direction. We
<br>have made clear the USG's skepticism and concern regarding
<br>the Spanish approach and believe we may succeed in limiting
<br>GOS interaction with Caracas to commercial rather than
<br>political collaboration. There is less cause for optimism on
<br>Cuba, where Zapatero's team appears intent on reviving
<br>"constructive engagement" at almost any cost.
<br>
<br>//Defining USG Objectives in Spain//
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Despite our turbulent relations with Zapatero, we
<br>have continued to engage the GOS constructively at the
<br>working level on the issues that matter most to us, with
<br>positive results. Most importantly, the Zapatero Government
<br>has not placed restrictions on U.S. forces access to Rota
<br>Naval Air Station and Moron Air Base, and has continued to
<br>issue blanket overflight clearances for U.S. forces
<br>transiting Spanish airspace, including to support operations
<br>in Iraq and Afghanistan.
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Military to military relations are strong in other
<br>respects and the uniformed services are among our strongest
<br>proponents in the current government. They are still
<br>smarting from their sudden and ignominious withdrawal from
<br>Iraq and have been forward leaning in recommending
<br>deployments to Afghanistan as a means of demonstrating their
<br>reliability as an ally and their commitment to the War on
<br>Terror. We want to strengthen this important bilateral
<br>relationship, for example by fixing a date for High-Level
<br>Bilateral Defense Committee talks in Washington.
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) The USG also has a strong interest in deepening its
<br>counter-terrorism cooperation with the GOS, particularly
<br>given the large and dangerous presence in the country of
<br>extremist organizations affiliated with al-Qaeda. In the
<br>wake of the March 11 train bombings, the GOS has clamped down
<br>on such organizations, leading to 117 arrests of suspected
<br>Islamic terrorists in 2004. However, judicial and
<br>investigative gaps in the Spanish system and the burgeoning
<br>population of North African immigrants will make Spain an
<br>active front in the War on Terror for years to come.
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Judicial and law-enforcement counter-terrorism
<br>cooperation with Spain is good and Attorney General Ashcroft
<br>visited in December to improve it further by signing the
<br>bilateral protocol to the U.S.-EU Mutual Legal Assistance and
<br>Extradition Treaties. Also in 2004, the GOS requested talks
<br>with the USG on forming a joint counter-terrorism
<br>investigative unit. This would be difficult for the USG to
<br>implement for technical reasons, but a DOJ team met with
<br>Spanish counterparts in December to identify mechanisms for
<br>improving information sharing and judicial cooperation. We
<br>can solidify our counter-terrorism relations by inviting
<br>Minister of the Interior Jose Antonio Alonso - a close friend
<br>of President Zapatero - to Washington at the earliest
<br>possible date. Alonso's staff has made clear Alonso desires
<br>such an invitation. Minister of Justice Juan Fernando Lopez
<br>Aguilar has also expressed interest in visiting Washington to
<br>discuss improved counter-terrorism cooperation.
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) We have strong commercial interests in Spain as well,
<br>with a business community that is staunchly supportive of
<br>U.S. investment and concerned that Zapatero's policies will
<br>lead to a decrease in U.S. business involvement. At every
<br>opportunity, we work to cultivate relations with GOS trade
<br>officials and encourage them to maintain a business-friendly
<br>environment in Spain.
<br>
<br>//What Does Spain Want?//
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) The GOS has gotten the message that a conflictive
<br>relationship with the USG is not in its best interest
<br>domestically or internationally. In the short term, they
<br>want a signal from us acknowledging their recent positive
<br>steps. In the GOS view, this could take the form of meetings
<br>in Washington in the next few months for Defense Minister
<br>Bono, Foreign Minister Moratinos, and later in the year,
<br>President Zapatero. Spain would also seek public statements
<br>recognizing its contributions in Afghanistan and Iraq
<br>reconstruction, and inclusion in U.S. councils with allies on
<br>issues such as the Middle East conflict, the Darfur crisis,
<br>matters related to the Greater Middle East, and other issues
<br>of mutual interest.
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) As an alternative to such high-level engagement, we
<br>could instead make a concerted effort at a lower level to
<br>acknowledge each Spanish gesture as a step in the right
<br>direction. This could take the form of a letter or a phone
<br>call from a USG official to thank the GOS for a specific
<br>action, such as its participation in the PRT in Afghanistan
<br>and its donation of funds to the Iraq elections. At a
<br>minimum, we strongly recommend agreeing to requests for
<br>meetings in Washington by Minister of the Interior Jose
<br>Antonio Alonso and Minister of Justice Juan Fernando Lopez
<br>Aguilar to discuss counter-terrorism cooperation. The
<br>objective of this calibrated approach would be to note
<br>progress on issues of interest to the USG and create momentum
<br>for higher level meetings while not giving the GOS the
<br>impression that we will overlook remaining points of
<br>conflict, such as President Zapatero's possible visit to
<br>Venezuela in March.
<br>
<br>//Steering Relations Toward a Productive Course//
<br>
<br>¶17. (C) The USG will not re-establish with the Zapatero
<br>Government the deep and close relationship we had with the
<br>Aznar administration. However, we are currently in a strong
<br>position to influence Zapatero towards a more productive
<br>course that achieves U.S. interests in Spain and other parts
<br>of the world. We have insisted with our GOS contacts that
<br>improved relations mean more than photo opportunities and
<br>expressions of goodwill; a real partnership implies positive
<br>actions. Those within the GOS who accepted this message
<br>counseled Zapatero to undertake the series of positive
<br>gestures described above. We believe we should now lock in
<br>these advances and respond favorably to these gestures in
<br>order to steer Zapatero towards supporting other USG
<br>objectives.
<br>
<br>¶18. (C) This may be a gradual and sometimes frustrating
<br>effort, since Zapatero's political instincts and those of
<br>other Socialist leaders, combined with their lingering
<br>insecurity over the nature of their electoral victory, will
<br>at times tempt them to emphasize their differences with USG
<br>policies. For the moment, the USG's balanced use of carrots
<br>and sticks with the GOS has gotten Spain pointed in the right
<br>direction. It is our sense that this opening will not last
<br>much longer and that eventually national pride and
<br>humiliation over USG snubs will lead Zapatero to suspend
<br>Spanish overtures and turn a deaf ear to USG requests for
<br>cooperation.
