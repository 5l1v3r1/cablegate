<br> 
<br> 
<br>Â¶1. (SBU) Chancellor Merkel's new Cabinet emerged early on October 24 
<br>after a month of intense media speculation about its make-up; it 
<br>contained several surprises.  Perhaps the most unexpected 
<br>announcements were that of former Interior Minister Schaeuble as 
<br>Finance Minister and former Economics Minister Karl-Theodor zu 
<br>Guttenberg as the new Defense Minister.  The Christian Democratic 
<br>Union (CDU) will run the Chancellery as well as six ministries and 
<br>have a minister without portfolio, the Free Democratic Party (FDP) 
<br>will hold five as well as the Vice Chancellorship, and the Christian 
<br>Social Union (CSU), three.  The ministerial competencies and their 
<br>names remain unchanged.  Following is a short description of 
<br>Merkel's new Cabinet, which was formally sworn in on October 28: 
<br> 
<br>Chief of the Chancellery and Minister 
<br>Without Portfolio: Ronald Pofalla (CDU) 
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>Pofalla, 50, takes over from Thomas de Maiziere as the Chancellor's 
<br>chief of staff.  Pofalla is a lawyer and since 2005 served as CDU 
<br>Secretary General.  He is known as a close confidant of Angela 
<br>Merkel.  As Secretary General, he had been criticized as lacking a 
<br>public profile and not being aggressive enough.  From 2004-2005 he 
<br>served as deputy caucus leader for economics and labor issues in the 
<br>Bundestag.  Also within the Chancellery, Merkel's security and 
<br>foreign policy advisor Christoph Heusgen remains, as do Maria 
<br>Boehmer as Minister of State for Migration, Refugees and Integration 
<br>and Bernd Neumann, Minister of State for Culture and Media.  Eckart 
<br>von Klaeden (CDU and a Merkel confidant) becomes State Minister in 
<br>the Chancellery for coordination with the federal states and 
<br>parliamentary contacts. 
<br> 
<br>Foreign Affairs: Guido Westerwelle (FDP) 
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>Westerwelle, 47, becomes Foreign Minister and Vice-Chancellor -- as 
<br>expected.  Economic Assistance will not be included in the Foreign 
<br>office, but the FDP will also control that ministry.  Minister of 
<br>State within the MFA will be Werner Hoyer, who already served in 
<br>that function under Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel from 1994-1998. 
<br>He also was Westerwelle's foreign policy adviser in the election 
<br>campaign.  He will cover all divisions apart from "culture" and 
<br>"economics and sustainable development."  The other Minister of 
<br>State is Cornelia Pieper, deputy FDP chairperson, who has no 
<br>experience in this field and will reportedly focus on cultural and 
<br>communication issues.  Martin Biesel, Westerwelle's Bundestag chief 
<br>of staff, will become a State Secretary within the MFA to coordinate 
<br>the work of the FDP ministries with the Chancellery.  Westerwelle 
<br>has described Biesel as his closest advisor. 
<br> 
<br>Defense: Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) 
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>The CSU's rising star, zu Guttenberg, 37, seemed certain to remain 
<br>in the cabinet.  However, there was speculation that his Economics 
<br>Ministry seat would be up for grabs.  When Economics went to the FDP 
<br>and Finance to Schaeuble, zu Guttenberg's best fit was in Defense. 
<br>The DefMin job gives zu Guttenberg the opportunity to work on 
<br>foreign and security issues again, which was his main area of 
<br>interest as a parliamentarian.  He is seen as a good and capable 
<br>replacement for Jung, who was widely criticized for being overly 
<br>cautious and inarticulate in explaining security and defense issues 
<br>to the German public.  Zu Guttenberg is expected to improve the 
<br>Defense Ministry's image, prestige and weight within the cabinet 
<br>through his popularity and public relations talents.  His 
<br>appointment has already boosted morale among working level officials 
<br>in the MOD, who believe that zu Guttenberg will make MOD a real 
<br>player once again in German security policy debates.  He is a 
<br>transatlanticist and well known in Washington.  He will likely give 
<br>the Defense Ministry a higher profile.  He will retain the current 
<br>Parliamentary State Secretaries Thomas Kossendey (CSU) and Christian 
<br>Schmidt (CSU). 
<br> 
<br>Interior: Thomas de Maiziere (CDU) 
<br>--------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>De Maiziere, 55, a lawyer, is a confidant of Angela Merkel and has 
<br>served as her chief of staff in the Chancellery for four years.  He 
<br>had been mentioned as a potential finance minister, but reportedly, 
<br>his personal preference was interior.  He brings some experience to 
<br>the job, since he served as state interior minister in Saxony 
<br>2004-2005 and as state minister of justice 2002-2004.  However, some 
<br>of the issues he will face as federal interior minister, namely 
<br>international terrorism, are topics he has less exposure to.  De 
<br>Maiziere is known to be a consensus builder who works the 
<br>interagency process well and is a good problem solver. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>BERLIN 00001360  002.2 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Finance: Wolfgang Schaeuble (CDU) 
<br>--------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>Merkel wanted a political heavy weight in this difficult position 
<br>during the financial and economic crisis.  Schaeuble, 67, is an 
<br>experienced, strong and well established politician from Germany's 
<br>southwest, who is expected to fill his new role quite well.  He has 
<br>by far the longest federal government experience in Merkel's 
<br>cabinet.  Confined to a wheel chair since he was shot during a 
<br>campaign rally in 1990, the conservative politician from the German 
<br>southwest is not known as a close friend of Chancellor Merkel's.  A 
<br>member of the Bundestag since 1972, he is pragmatic, copes well with 
<br>pressure, and is known for his fierce loyalty.  He does not shy away 
<br>from confrontation and will be ready to pursue unpopular or 
<br>controversial measures.  In light of his age and his political 
<br>standing, he does not have to fear any consequences for his future 
<br>career, which a younger candidate would take into consideration. 
<br>While he had to give up the Interior Ministry (which he reportedly 
<br>liked very much), he is being compensated by running one of the most 
<br>influential ministries in the cabinet.  While he cooperated well 
<br>during the coalition talks, political observers would have expected 
<br>major clashes with FDP Justice Minister Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger 
<br>over domestic security issues if he had remained in the Interior 
<br>Ministry. 
<br> 
<br>Economics and Technology: Rainer Bruederle (FDP) 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -- 
<br> 
<br>Bruederle, 64, has been deputy caucus chief and economic spokesman 
<br>of the FDP in the Bundestag.  He already served as economic minster 
<br>in Rhineland Palatinate 1987-1998, where he strongly promoted 
<br>wine-growers, trade, and small and midsize business.  Since 1983 he 
<br>has been state chairman of the FDP in Rhineland Palatinate and 
<br>member of the national executive committee and since 1995 deputy 
<br>national party chairman.  Hans-Joachim Otto and Ernst Burgbacher 
<br>(both FDP) will become State Secretaries within that Ministry. 
<br> 
<br>Labor and Social Affairs: Franz-Josef Jung (CDU) 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -- 
<br> 
<br>Defense Minister Jung, 60, was unexpectedly switched to the Labor 
<br>and Social Affairs ministry.  Jung had fallen victim to much 
<br>criticism during his tenure as Defense Minister and Merkel had been 
<br>pressured to replace him.  Merkel, however, had to find another 
<br>cabinet post for Jung to maintain a proportional regional 
<br>representation in the cabinet - Jung's state of Hesse had to be 
<br>represented.   Another reason for Merkel to keep Jung in the cabinet 
<br>in spite of his weaknesses and previous failures is his loyalty as a 
<br>minister. 
<br> 
<br>Justice: Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger (FDP) 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -- 
<br> 
<br>Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, 58, is FDP chairperson and caucus chief 
<br>in Bavaria.  She successfully ran the 2008 FDP election campaign in 
<br>that state, where the FDP reentered the state parliament after 14 
<br>years of absence.  She was the FDP's chief negotiator on Justice in 
<br>the coalition talks.  She previously served as Justice Minister 
<br>under Chancellor Kohl from 1992-1996, but resigned in opposition to 
<br>legislation allowing electronic eavesdropping of private residences, 
<br>which was planned by her own government.  She has a strong focus on 
<br>civil rights and data protection, and has been critical of what she 
<br>views are overly intrusive wiretapping and other electronic 
<br>surveillance measures (see ref C). 
<br> 
<br>Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women 
<br>and Youth: Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) 
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>Von der Leyen, 51, a medical doctor and mother of seven, had 
<br>indicated a strong interest in moving to the health portfolio and 
<br>worked out that respective section of the coalition agreement for 
<br>the CDU.  Merkel reportedly was not interested, however, in the CDU 
<br>controlling the health ministry in light of the necessary but 
<br>unpopular reforms and increasing costs of health care for citizens. 
<br>Since the health ministry went to the FDP, von der Leyen will remain 
<br>in her current position. In the past few years, von der Leyen has 
<br>successfully modernized the family policy of the CDU and thus its 
<br>image in this sector.  She is one of Germany's most popular 
<br>politicians according to public opinion polls. 
<br> 
<br>Health: Philipp Roesler (FDP) 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>Roesler, 36, is the youngest member of the cabinet and his 
<br>nomination was a surprise.  He is sharp and dynamic and a rising 
<br>star of the FDP.  He was state secretary general, state party 
<br>chairman and eventually economics minister in Lower-Saxony.  He was 
<br>born in Vietnam and was adopted by a German family.  Both Roesler 
<br> 
<br>BERLIN 00001360  003.2 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>and his wife are medical doctors, which gives him some practical 
<br>background for his new portfolio.  Roesler negotiated the health 
<br>section of the coalition agreement for the FDP. 
<br> 
<br>Environment, Nature Conservation and 
<br>Nuclear Safety: Norbert Roettgen (CDU) 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>Roettgen, 44, a close confidant of Chancellor Merkel had also been 
<br>named as potential chief of staff at the Chancellery.  He has worked 
<br>closely with the Chancellor since her days as caucus chairman 
<br>2002-2005.  Merkel reportedly appreciates his loyalty and analytical 
<br>talents.  During the financial crisis he became one of her closest 
<br>advisors.  While he does not have a reputation for expertise in his 
<br>new portfolio, Merkel obviously wanted to position many of her 
<br>confidants in the new cabinet.  Environmental issues, especially 
<br>climate change, will figure prominently for Merkel. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Education and Research: Annette Schavan (CDU) 
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>Schavan, 54, will keep her current cabinet position.  Even though 
<br>she did not have a prominent record, as a confidant of Angela 
<br>Merkel, it was assumed that she would stay on as a member of the 
<br>cabinet. 
<br> 
<br>Transportation, Building, and Urban 
<br>Development:  Peter Ramsauer (CSU) 
<br>----------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>Since November 2005, Ramsauer, 55, has served as head of the CSU 
<br>group in the Bundestag and deputy CDU/CSU caucus chief.  As minister 
<br>for construction, housing and transportation, he will have a huge 
<br>budget to work with. 
<br> 
<br>Food, Agriculture, and Consumer Protection: 
<br>Ilse Aigner (CSU) 
<br>------------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>Aigner, 44, only became Minister for Agriculture and Consumer 
<br>Protection in October 2008.  She came to this job as an expert on 
<br>research issues and new to the realities of production agriculture. 
<br>In her tenure, some parts of the German agriculture community have 
<br>been critical of her performance, particularly her close 
<br>relationship to Bavarian Minister President Horst Seehofer. The CSU 
<br>was interested in keeping this portfolio since agriculture continues 
<br>to play an important and tactical role in Bavaria. 
<br> 
<br>Economic Cooperation and Development: Dirk Niebel (FDP) 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----- 
<br> 
<br>Niebel, 46, has been Secretary General of the FDP since May 2005 and 
<br>belongs to the inner leadership circle of the FDP.  He was named as 
<br>a potential minister since he made strong contributions to the 
<br>electoral success of the FDP.  His actual expertise would have been 
<br>labor and social affairs.  However, that portfolio went to the CDU. 
<br>The FDP sought in the coalition talks to have the Ministry of 
<br>Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) merged with the MFA, but 
<br>failing that, having control of both ministries goes a long way to 
<br>meeting its concern that BMZ development policy be in line with MFA 
<br>priorities, especially on key issues like Afghanistan.  Media 
<br>commentary has focused on Niebel's lack of previous experience in 
<br>development assistance, and how he may essentially serve as a 
<br>department head under Foreign Minister Westerwelle. 
<br> 
<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>Â¶2.  (SBU) With five ministries in the new cabinet, the FDP is 
<br>arguably one of the most powerful junior coalition partners in 
<br>recent German history in terms of both the number and quality of 
<br>their cabinet appointments.  The Greens had three, mostly junior, 
<br>ministries in their coalition with the Social Democrats from 
<br>1998-2005.  The FDP has one more than it had during its last 
<br>coalition with the CDU.  This is due in part to the election outcome 
<br>in which the FDP had its strongest-ever performance, with 14.6 
<br>percent of the vote.  CDU officials also describe the appointments 
<br>as partial compensation for the policy concessions the FDP made 
<br>during coalition negotiations.  The CDU/CSU will have the popular 
<br>and competent Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg as Defense Minister, 
<br>balancing the FDP's control over Foreign Affairs and Development 
<br>Assistance.  Zu Guttenberg -- a strong transatlanticist -- is 
<br>well-connected in Washington and already has a strong background in 
<br>foreign and security policy.  There has been some criticism that the 
<br>new Cabinet does not have any representation from eastern states. 
<br>Merkel responded to the criticism reminding that in fact the 
<br>Chancellor herself counts as representing the East.  End comment.
