<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY. Post has comfirmed that a wholly Venezuelan 
<br>government-owned company, Bolipuertos, is now charged with 
<br>the management of Venezuela's ports. Cuba's ASPORT has a 49 
<br>percent share in Puertos del Alba, a separate company, which 
<br>will reportedly be focused on business development. Contacts 
<br>in shipping circles, however, tell us that the Cubans are 
<br>active in the ports as "advisors" to Bolipuertos and were 
<br>instrumental in pushing for the take over of port operations. 
<br>Bolipuertos has taken over private warehouse operations at 
<br>three ports named in the original March 25 Decree (Guamache, 
<br>Maracaibo, Puerto Cabello) as well as a fourth -- La Guaira, 
<br>the port serving Caracas. Shipping contacts report rumors 
<br>that the government may nationalize stevedoring and customs 
<br>agent services. Insurance premiums have reportedly increased 
<br>35-40 percent since May. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>BOLIPUERTOS & PUERTOS DEL ALBA 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) Post has clarified the issue of the management of 
<br>Venezuela's ports. Two companies of virtually the same name 
<br>have been decreed by the Government of the Bolivarian 
<br>Republic of Venezuela (GBRV). The first -- Bolivariana de 
<br>Puertos S.A. (BPSA or Bolipuertos) -- was founded by Decree 
<br>on June 12, 2007. This company was to be a mixed 
<br>Venezuelan-Cuban company with Cuba's Grupo Empresarial de la 
<br>Industria Portuaria (ASPORT) having a 49 percent share. We 
<br>understand that this first Bolipuertos was never actually 
<br>registered as a company. The second Bolivariana de Puertos 
<br>(BP or Bolipuertos) was created by Decree No. 6,645 dated 
<br>March 25, 2009, to "maintain, administer and develop" 
<br>Venezuela's ports. According to that Decree, the Venezuelan 
<br>state holds 100 percent of the capital of the second 
<br>Bolipuertos which was assigned to the Ministry for Public 
<br>Works and Housing. Neither of these companies is Puertos del 
<br>Alba in which the Cubans have a significant investment. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) On July 29, 2009, as reported reftel, the GBRV 
<br>published another Decree in the National Gazette authorizing 
<br>the creation of Puertos del Alba, a state-owned company to be 
<br>charged with "modernizing, renovating, equipping, and 
<br>constructing" ports in Venezuela and Cuba. Cuba's ASPORT has 
<br>a 49 percent share in Puertos del Alba with the 51 percent 
<br>majority share remaining with Bolipuertos. A close Embassy 
<br>contact tells us that the intent of the GBRV is to "follow 
<br>the Cuban model" by installing a company (Bolipuertos) that 
<br>will run all aspects of port operations in Venezuela while 
<br>Puertos del Alba will act as its business development arm. 
<br>Other contacts assert that Bolipuertos retains Cuban 
<br>"advisors" on staff, but they do not believe that the Cubans 
<br>have formal managerial responsibility in the company. These 
<br>advisors, however, are believed to have urged the GBRV to 
<br>move ahead with taking control of the ports. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) The March 25, 2009, Decree creating (or re-creating) 
<br>Bolipuertos stipulated that it would be responsible for the 
<br>infrastructure of Puerto El Guamache (the Isla Marguerita 
<br>cruise ship port), Maracaibo Port, Puerto Cabello 
<br>(Venezuela's largest port), as well as that of "any ports to 
<br>be developed in the future." As reported reftels, a 
<br>subsequent Decree dated July 30, declared the immediate 
<br>nationalization of private warehouse operations at the three 
<br>ports named in the March 25 Decree as well as a fourth -- La 
<br>Guaira, the port serving Caracas. Our contacts in the 
<br>shipping industry tell us that it appears likely that 
<br>Bolipuertos will also take control of port operations at 
<br>Guanta, Palua/Puerto Ordaz, Guiria and Cumana. 
<br>
<br>PORT SERVICES STILL TROUBLED 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Operations in Puerto Cabello were interrupted for 
<br>four days following the take over of warehouse operations at 
<br>the beginning of August. Reports of significant problems 
<br>have continued since the resumption of operations. Former 
<br>Petroleum Chamber President Andres Duarte (protect 
<br>throughout) informed Econoffs that his stevedore company has 
<br>not been allowed to remove equipment from the port for 
<br>maintenance or weekend storage in what many believe is a 
<br>
<br>CARACAS 00001181 002.2 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>precursor to the expropriation of stevedoring and other 
<br>terminal services. Another contact whose company provided 
<br>warehouse services at Puerto Cabello, directed Econoffs' 
<br>attention to another company, Venezolana de Exportaciones y 
<br>Importaciones, C.A. (VEXINCA), established by Decree No. 
<br>38954 dated June 17, 2008. According to this contact, 
<br>VEXINCA, which is run by the military as are the ports at 
<br>this point, is actively offering customs services to the 
<br>clients of private sector customs agents. Our contact 
<br>speculates that VEXINCA may eventually be designated as the 
<br>sole provider of customs services in Venezuela. 
<br>
<br>INSURANCE AND OTHER RISKS 
<br>------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Duarte informed Econoffs that insurance premiums have 
<br>increased 35-40 percent since the May 2009 announcement of 
<br>the Marine Committee of the Lloyd's Market Association that 
<br>it had withdrawn maritime war-risk policy coverage for 
<br>Venezuela. Other local shipping contacts have confirmed a 
<br>bulletin that ran in a British shipping magazine in August 
<br>noting that it may be difficult to make claims against 
<br>Bolipuertos for robbery, damage etc. According to Duarte, 
<br>Norweigan and Panamanian owned ships that used to bring soda 
<br>ash to Venezuela have already been swapped out for older 
<br>vessels with much smaller cargo capacity that cannot maintain 
<br>the previous off-loading rate of 50,000 tons per day. Duarte 
<br>also confirmed that the GBRV will have to pay a higher 
<br>premium on refrigerated shipping containers to European and 
<br>Brazilian firms as Maersk will no longer send them to 
<br>Venezuela as it has been unable to retrieve them in the past 
<br>due to the chaos in the ports. It has also been reported that 
<br>shipping line Hamburg Sud will no longer serve Venezuela. 
<br>¶7. (C) COMMENT: Many observers note that decreased traffic 
<br>arising from the global recession has saved Venezuela's ports 
<br>from complete strangulation. The wilderness of stacked 
<br>containers at the ports has improved. However, few here 
<br>believe that the GBRV has the know-how or the logistical 
<br>experience to manage the ports even with the assistance of 
<br>Cuban advisors. There is speculation that some port 
<br>operations may ultimately be handed over to friendly 
<br>governments on a concessionary basis.
