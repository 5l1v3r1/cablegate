<br>SUBJECT: THE NEW BLE GOUDE 
<br>
<br>Classified By: POL/ECON SECTION CHIEF SILVIA EIRIZ FOR REASONS 1.4 (B/D 
<br>). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary. Charles Ble Goude, leader of COJEP 
<br>(PanAfrican Congress of Young Patriots), is one of three 
<br>Ivorians under United Nations (UN) Security Council 
<br>sanctions. However, an offensive seems to be underway, 
<br>bolstered by the presidential camp, to re-shape Ble Goude's 
<br>public image and portray him as a future statesman. Ble 
<br>Goude's transformation began with his national tour in 2007 
<br>to promote reconciliation. He has gained prominence recently 
<br>by launching a foundation that provides skills training and 
<br>employment for youth. All indications are that President 
<br>Gbagbo and some of his closest advisors continue to embrace 
<br>this divisive and controversial figure. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) Ble Goude was placed under UN sanctions on February 7, 
<br>2006 for repeated public statements advocating violence 
<br>against UN installations, UN personnel, and foreigners, as 
<br>well as directing and participating in acts of violence by 
<br>street militias, including beatings, rapes, and extrajudicial 
<br>killings. The UN determined that he intimidated the UN, the 
<br>International Working Group (IWG), the political opposition, 
<br>and the independent press and sabotaged international radio 
<br>stations. The UN also found that he was an obstacle to the 
<br>action of the IWG, the United Nations Operation in Cote 
<br>d'Ivoire (UNOCI), the French forces, and the peace process as 
<br>defined by resolution 1643 of 2005. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Ble Goude kept a low profile for some time after 
<br>sanctions were imposed but has, since last year, undertaken 
<br>actions to transform his public image from leader of an armed 
<br>militia to statesman. He has been very visible in the media 
<br>in the last three months in what appears to be a charm 
<br>offensive to demonstrate to the Ivoiran public that he is a 
<br>serious political actor. He has conducted press interviews 
<br>and his second book is scheduled to be released during the 
<br>month of June. According to the French Embassy, Ble Goude 
<br>has become a wealthy businessman, with substantial holdings 
<br>in hotels, nightclubs, restaurants, gas stations, and real 
<br>estate in Cote d'Ivoire. French Emboff told us that Ble 
<br>Goude requires payment for all activities he undertakes on 
<br>behalf of the Presidency and the FPI governing party. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (U) Ble Goude began his political career in the Student 
<br>Federation of Cote d'Ivoire (FESCI), rising through the ranks 
<br>to succeed current Prime Minister Soro as FESCI's Secretary 
<br>General from 1998 to 2000. In 2001, he founded COJEP (the 
<br>Pan African Congress of Young Patriots) which he continues to 
<br>lead. Ble Goude started his public transformation by casting 
<br>himself as a peacemaker and conciliator when he launched a 
<br>"peace caravan" in 2007. Over the course of 3 months, he 
<br>visited 45 towns throughout the country, spreading the theme 
<br>of reconciliation between rebel and government supporters. 
<br>Although many observers doubted and continue to doubt his 
<br>sincerity, Ble Goude evidently delivered a consistent message 
<br>of peace and reconciliation in his speeches to the youth. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (U) His newest venture is the launching of a "Forum of 
<br>Information and Orientation" that will provide skills 
<br>training and find jobs for 200 youth. Minister of National 
<br>Reconciliation Sebastien Dano Djedje, a member of the 
<br>President's FPI party, delivered a speech at the project's 
<br>March 14 launching ceremony. According to Ble Goude, 12,000 
<br>young people contacted his Forum seeking to be selected. 
<br>Minister for Planning and Development Paul-Antoine Bohoun 
<br>Bouabre, also an FPI member, publicly presented Ble Goude 
<br>with a check for 5 million CFA (USD 12,000) to support this 
<br>project. Ble Goude's forum was covered on national TV and 
<br>interviews with him were run several times. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (U) The June 6 edition of the government's newspaper, 
<br>"Fraternite Matin," featured an interview with Ble Goude 
<br>photographed in a suit and tie. Ble Goude said he launched 
<br>his Forum because as head of a youth movement, he has an 
<br>obligation to guide the country's youth. He lamented that 
<br>Cote d'Ivoire's moral fiber has weakened, leading people to 
<br>seek shortcuts around the law and to take into account only 
<br>those with financial means. Asked by his interviewer to 
<br>comment on the arrest of DRC rebel leader Jean-Pierre Bemba, 
<br>Ble Goude responded that one is never a rebel for life, 
<br>adding that either one becomes a member of society or ends up 
<br>like Charles Taylor or Jean-Pierre Bemba or Jonas Savimbi. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) While Ble Goude does not seem to have the following he 
<br>commanded several years ago, he still has his COJEP faithful 
<br>that he could mobilize. He also maintains a strong influence 
<br>over FESCI. Konan Bertin Kouadio, President of the Youth 
<br>Section of opposition political party PDCI, told Poloffs June 
<br>10 that Ble Goude cannot organize the demonstrations and 
<br>disturbances that he carried out several years ago, but that 
<br>a large number of youth would still take to the streets if he 
<br>gave the order. RDR Youth Section head Yayoro Karamokotel 
<br>told Poloff that Ble Goude is Gbagbo's youth campaign 
<br>manager. Skepticism about whether Ble Goude is genuinely 
<br>committed to peaceful political dialogue remains quite high. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Comment. President Gbagbo has repeatedly asked the UN 
<br>to lift sanctions against Ble Goude and reportedly remains 
<br>one of his strongest supporters, along with Simone Gbagbo. 
<br>The choice of Ble Goude as youth campaign manager is clever 
<br>because the charismatic Ble Goude can easily motivate and 
<br>mobilize. It is disturbing, however, that Gbagbo's camp 
<br>seems to be grooming Ble Goude for future positions in the 
<br>party and/or the government rather than distancing itself 
<br>from someone who remains under UN sanctions and who is still 
<br>a divisive and controversial figure at home. Embassy contacts 
<br>seem convinced that the government is financing the bulk of 
<br>Ble Goude's activities, which raises concerns about Gbagbo's 
<br>genuine commitment to implementation of the Ouagadougou 
<br>Political Agreement (OPA). The government can finance Ble 
<br>Goude's jobs for youth initiative, but states it lacks the 
<br>funds for the civic service program for ex-combatants, which 
<br>is an integral part of the OPA. It appears that Ble Goude is 
<br>succeeding in his effort to re-define himself to the Ivorian 
<br>public, but whether his actions will eventually bear out his 
<br>new image remains to be seen. End Comment.
