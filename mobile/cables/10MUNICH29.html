<br>SUBJECT: GERMANY/BAVARIA: HORST SEEHOFER, MOSTLY FOCUSED ON 
<br>DOMESTIC POLITICS 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Consul General Conrad Tribble for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d 
<br>) 
<br> 
<br>SUMMARY 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (C)  Horst Seehofer, an unpredictable politician 
<br>struggling to regain his party's hegemony in Bavaria, 
<br>revealed only shallow foreign policy expertise when he met 
<br>Ambassador Murphy on the sidelines of the Munich Security 
<br>Conference on February 6.  Seehofer, Minister President and 
<br>leader of the Christian Social Union (CSU), did not 
<br>contradict the Ambassador when he reviewed the new NATO 
<br>Afghanistan policy, which implied Seehofer was now on board 
<br>with the German governing coalition in this respect.  Closer 
<br>to home, he expected the trend away from the major political 
<br>parties to continue in Germany, creating opportunities for 
<br>numerous smaller parties to enter German statehouses. 
<br>Observers of Seehofer and his leadership of the CSU may wish 
<br>to take his public pronouncements with a grain of salt, 
<br>especially when he contradicts or criticize American foreign 
<br>policy goals as he did recently on Afghanistan.  End Summary. 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (SBU)  Ambassador Murphy met with Bavarian Minister 
<br>President and CSU Party Chairman Horst Seehofer on the 
<br>margins of the Munich Security Conference on February 6. 
<br>Referring to his recent visit to Afghanistan, the Ambassador 
<br>told Seehofer how impressed he was with the German operation 
<br>in the North, stressing the importance of the new Afghanistan 
<br>strategy.  He praised the nomination of Volker Wieker to new 
<br>Inspector General of the German Army, since Wieker had been 
<br>General McChrystal's right hand and really knew what was 
<br>going on.  The Ambassador further emphasized the point that 
<br>2,500 U.S. soldiers would be sent to the North, but that 
<br>Germans would be in control.  Maximum effort was necessary," 
<br>he said, noting "if we don't try, we fail."  Turning to Iran, 
<br>Seehofer asked about the Ambassador's assessment of Iranian 
<br>Foreign Minister Mottaki's appearance in Munich, and Murphy 
<br>answered that Mottaki's were rather vain and 
<br>counter-productive efforts that could not be taken seriously. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C)  In general, Seehofer had little to say regarding 
<br>foreign policy and seemed uninformed about basic things.  For 
<br>example, he expressed surprise when State Chancery Minister 
<br>Siegfried Schneider, also present, emphasized that 20,000 out 
<br>of the 40,000 U.S. soldiers in Germany were stationed in 
<br>Bavaria.  The Ambassador emphasized the excellent 
<br>Bavarian-American relations, stressing his visits to the 
<br>Bavarian Representation in Berlin and the many business 
<br>contacts.  Seehofer pointed to the economic/financial crisis 
<br>and was not sure whether the EU would bail out Greece.  He 
<br>called for better regulation of financial markets, adding 
<br>that the CDU/CSU's coalition partner, the FDP, was still 
<br>dreaming about "total liberty," yet the citizens were more 
<br>realistic.  The Bavarian economy remained strong, he said, 
<br>but despite relative low unemployment overall, Bavaria 
<br>struggled with serious regional economic differences around 
<br>the state.  "You no longer buy our cars," he joked.  The main 
<br>problem for the Bavarian budget was the unresolved situation 
<br>of BayernLB, he admitted.  Federal Health Minister from 1992 
<br>to 1998, Seehofer expressed interest in the chances of 
<br>success of the U.S. health reform, expressing his concern 
<br>about 47 million Americans who had no health insurance. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (C)  The Ambassador and Seehofer agreed that the 
<br>political landscape in Germany had changed radically over the 
<br>past few years.  Seehofer did not dare predict an outcome of 
<br>the May election in North Rhine Westphalia.  Everything was 
<br>possible, he said.  German citizens no longer shrank from 
<br>voting for the Left Party and in the long run, the SPD and 
<br>Left Party would likely come together again.  Five to six 
<br>parties now had a realistic chance of entering state 
<br>parliaments, even in Bavaria. 
<br> 
<br>COMMENT 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (C) As chairman of one of the three parties that make up 
<br>the governing coalition in Berlin, Seehofer frequently and 
<br>quite publicly addresses sensitive political issues, 
<br>including foreign policy.  Back in December, he gave an 
<br>interview flatly rejecting an increase of German soldiers in 
<br>Afghanistan, which startled many political observers, 
<br>including CSU insiders.  We note that Seehofer has never 
<br>professed to be a foreign policy expert.  His strengths are 
<br>rather more in domestic politics.  The drop of public support 
<br>for the CSU in recent elections has further encouraged 
<br>Seehofer's natural instincts to utter populist pronouncements 
<br>

<br> 
<br>rather than substantive statements.
