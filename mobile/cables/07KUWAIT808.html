<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) Summary: On April 23-24, Treasury Assistant
<br>Secretary for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes
<br>
<br>Sipdis
<br>Patrick O'Brien met with senior GOK officials on anti-money
<br>laundering and counter-terrorism finance (AML/CTF) issues.
<br>He conveyed USG concerns about the activities of the
<br>Kuwait-based charity the Revival of Islamic Heritage Society
<br>(RIHS), specifically the activities of branches in Albania,
<br>Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Bosnia, Cambodia, Russia, Somalia,
<br>and Thailand. O'Brien urged the GOK to demonstrate support
<br>for international counterterrorism efforts by withdrawing its
<br>appeal to Qatar and allowing the UN 1267 Sanctions Committee
<br>to designate three Kuwaiti terrorist facilitators: Jaber
<br>Al-Jalahmah, Hamid Al-Ali, and Mubarak Al-Bathali, designated
<br>by the U.S. in December 2006, pursuant to E.O. 13224.
<br>O'Brien also pressed for the swift adoption of a revised
<br>draft money laundering law that will criminalize terrorist
<br>financing, create inbound and outbound cash reporting
<br>requirements encompassing all ports of entry and exit, and
<br>allow the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) to receive
<br>Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) directly from banks rather
<br>than going through the Office of the Public Prosecutor (OPP).
<br>In addition, he discussed the potential for further USG
<br>technical assistance on cash couriers.
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) O'Brien met with xxxxxxxxxxxx In all of his meetings, O'Brien stressed
<br>that while U.S.-Kuwait cooperation on counterterrorism was
<br>strong, there were significant areas of USG concern on
<br>AML/CTF. GOK officials conveyed Kuwait's strong commitment
<br>to fighting terror in all of its forms, including through
<br>curbs on terrorist financing, and described GOK efforts to
<br>raise public awareness of these issues in Kuwait. MOSAL and
<br>MFA both disagreed that RIHS activities abroad constituted
<br>support for terrorism. xxxxxxxxxxxx, in particular, suggested
<br>the U.S. cases against RIHS and the three terrorist
<br>facilitators were full of holes, but failed to provide hard
<br>evidence to support his claims. Absent "concrete evidence,"
<br>GOK officials said that it would be impossible for the GOK to
<br>support USG efforts to designate RIHS branches abroad or ask
<br>Qatar to remove its hold on the designation of the three
<br>Kuwaitis at the UN 1267 Sanctions Committee. GOK
<br>interlocutors also indicated that a technical review of a
<br>draft amendment to the current GOK money laundering law is
<br>nearing completion and the revision will be presented to the
<br>National AML/CTF Committee Chairman, the CBK Governor, soon
<br>(see para 18). End summary.
<br>
<br>Ministry of Foreign Affairs:
<br>"We Need Evidence, Not Speculation"
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) On April 23-24, Treasury Assistant Secretary for
<br>Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes Patrick O'Brien
<br>visited Kuwait for meetings with senior GOK officials to
<br>discuss AML/CTF issues, charities -- specifically RIHS -- and
<br>UNSCR 1267. In a two-hour long meeting with xxxxxxxxxxxx,
<br>
<br>Kuwait 00000808 002 of 007
<br>
<br>
<br>O'Brien expressed concern about RIHS and passed xxxxxxxxxxxx a
<br>non-paper on its activities (ref A). O'Brien noted that the
<br>USG has shared information on RIHS activities with the GOK
<br>since 2002 and that non-papers were passed to the GOK on
<br>numerous occasions detailing ongoing RIHS terrorist support
<br>activities. O'Brien conveyed USG intentions to pursue
<br>domestic and UN designations of eight RIHS branch offices:
<br>Albania, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Bosnia, Cambodia, Russia,
<br>Somalia and Thailand. O'Brien described enforcement actions
<br>taken by the governments of Afghanistan, Albania, Azerbaijan,
<br>Bangladesh, Bosnia, Pakistan, and Russia against RIHS branch
<br>offices. He added that the USG is working with foreign
<br>governments that have RIHS branches of concern to gather
<br>additional evidence and pass to the GOK.
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) xxxxxxxxxxxx reiterated GOK concerns about the
<br>absence of solid evidence in the USG case against RIHS and
<br>noted that "absent hard evidence" the GOK would not support
<br>the USG designation of RIHS and would ask Qatar to block any
<br>names associated with RIHS brought to the UNSC.xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>explained that charities must receive approval both
<br>internally -- from the Ministries of Social Affairs and
<br>Labor, Foreign Affairs, and the Central Bank of Kuwait -- and
<br>externally from the host governments where projects are to be
<br>carried out. xxxxxxxxxxxx insisted that "the GOK has yet to
<br>receive reports of wrongdoing from any of the countries where
<br>RIHS operates" and that the GOK will not take action on USG
<br>accusations without investigating them first. xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>noted that when he received the expanded USG non-paper in
<br>September 2006, he eagerly followed up with host governments,
<br>but the responses he has received from them to date paint a
<br>"completely different" picture from that conveyed by the USG.
<br>Waving a sheath of documents, xxxxxxxxxxxx said the written
<br>report of the GOK's own findings would be shared with the USG
<br>soon. xxxxxxxxxxxx did not present any papers containing hard
<br>evidence, asserting that he did not want to pass information
<br>along until he had a "full and complete report."
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) xxxxxxxxxxxx made the following specific points:
<br>
<br>- Bangladesh: xxxxxxxxxxxx asserted that USG charges are
<br>different from those of the GOB. "The USG non-paper said
<br>RIHS' accounts were frozen while in reality the Bangladesh
<br>NGO Office renewed RIHS' registration for another 5 years in
<br>November 2006," he stated. He added that the GOK has been
<br>told RIHS projects in Bangladesh are going well. (Note: the
<br>two issues are separate, and restrictions on RIHS
<br>Bangladesh's bank accounts should merit more concern by the
<br>GOK. The government of Bangladesh canceled RIHS's license on
<br>May 18. End Note).
<br>
<br>- Russia: xxxxxxxxxxxx noted that there are no RIHS branches
<br>in Russia, a point which the GOK has already discussed with
<br>the GOR. All charities in Russia are approved by the
<br>Ministry of Assistance, and the GOK was very surprised to
<br>learn that the GOR designated RIHS -- a charity that had
<br>Ministry approval, he continued. O'Brien replied that in
<br>July 2006 the GOR publicly identified RIHS as a terrorist
<br>organization, listing it among a group of 17 organizations
<br>banned in Russia.
<br>
<br>- Bosnia: xxxxxxxxxxxx said the GOK has received two official
<br>letters praising RIHS' work from the Ministry of Immigration.
<br>(Note: European forces and Sarajevan Cantonal police raided
<br>the Sarajevo office of RIHS in December 2006. End Note).
<br>
<br>- Albania: xxxxxxxxxxxx acknowledged that the RIHS office in
<br>Albania has been closed since 2005, but noted that all
<br>charity branches in Albania were closed at that time as the
<br>result of a political decision. All charity work, he
<br>continued, now goes through the "Religious Committee" in
<br>Tirana. (Note: In addition to the closure of the office,
<br>
<br>Kuwait 00000808 003 of 007
<br>
<br>
<br>the GOA also froze RIHS's funds. End Note).
<br>
<br>- Kosovo: xxxxxxxxxxxx stated that all charity work in Kosovo
<br>must have the approval of European Forces Command. He
<br>acknowledged that the GOK has received some comments, but
<br>maintained they still differ from USG accounts. O'Brien
<br>pointed to derogatory information on RIHS Kosovo's activities
<br>in the RIHS non-paper (ref A).
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) O'Brien briefed xxxxxxxxxxxx ref A reiterating
<br>previous assurances (ref D) that the USG will work with the
<br>countries concerned to provide additional information to the
<br>GOK. O'Brien noted that the USG welcomes additional
<br>information on GOK findings, but added that the USG believes
<br>it is time to take action. (Comment: xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>indicated his willingness to share GOK findings in writing in
<br>previous meetings with Emboffs, but Post has yet to receive
<br>anything in writing. It is unclear if he actually has any
<br>hard evidence, including the infamous two letters of
<br>commendation from the Bosnian Ministry of Immigration. In
<br>mentioning RIHS Kosovo, xxxxxxxxxxxx noted that it is not among
<br>the eight branches currently being considered for
<br>designation. Post would appreciate additional information on
<br>why Kosovo and Indonesia are no longer being considered, for
<br>internal use and/or to share with the GOK if asked. End
<br>comment.)
<br>
<br>Ministry of Foreign Affairs on
<br>Bathali, Al-Ali, Al-Jalahmah
<br>------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (S/NF) O'Brien presented xxxxxxxxxxxx with ref B non-paper
<br>outlining continued activity by Al-Jalahmah, Al-Ali, and
<br>Bathali in spite of their December 7, 2006 designation in the
<br>United States. Despite GOK assurances that their activities
<br>would be monitored and restricted, the three have continued
<br>to engage in fundraising and the provision of logistical
<br>support for terrorism as well as travel outside of the
<br>country. When asked, xxxxxxxxxxxx said the GOK would not be
<br>willing to ask Qatar to remove its hold on the UN designation
<br>of the three, placed there at the GOK's behest. xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>argued that the charges against the three have not been
<br>proven and "the GOK would be sued" if it supported such
<br>accusations at the UN. Speaking generally about the three
<br>individuals, xxxxxxxxxxxx stated they were taken to the
<br>"highest courts" and proven innocent. "I can't put them in
<br>jail because of suspicions," he continued. When queried by
<br>O'Brien on the nature of their crimes, it turned out that the
<br>three were acquitted for crimes unrelated to their current
<br>activities. For example, Jalahmah was tried for beating a
<br>woman who was not fully covered. O'Brien pressed xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>on the issue, stating that current USG concerns and
<br>derogatory information are unrelated to any prior GOK legal
<br>action against these individuals.
<br>
<br>¶8. (S/NF) xxxxxxxxxxxx continued that Bathali was not mentally
<br>stable and that he is getting more attention than he
<br>deserves. O'Brien responded that regardless of xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>impression of Bathali's mental state, he remains a threat as
<br>demonstrated by his actions. Responding to a point in ref B
<br>non-paper on Al-Jalahmah and Bathali's travel to Qatar to
<br>appear on Al-Jazeera. xxxxxxxxxxxx asked O'Brien if appearing
<br>on Al-Jazeera was a crime. O'Brien explained that the USG
<br>concern was their travel outside of Kuwait despite GOK
<br>assurances (ref D) to monitor their actions. xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>insisted that the GOK is monitoring them and is coordinating
<br>its efforts with other Gulf countries. O'Brien reiterated
<br>his call for GOK action noting that public action against a
<br>bad actor engenders greater confidence in a country's AML/CTF
<br>regime.
<br>
<br>Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor:
<br>
<br>Kuwait 00000808 004 of 007
<br>
<br>
<br>Culture of Giving, Change Takes Time
<br>--------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶9. (S/NF) Reflecting upon the history of charitable work in
<br>Kuwait, xxxxxxxxxxxx noted that the GOK is
<br>trying to work with a culture of giving that is ingrained in
<br>both society and religion, "and it is not an easy mix in
<br>Kuwait." A 1969 law legalized charities in Kuwait and for
<br>many years they operated on their own with little to no GOK
<br>supervision. Today, the GOK is doing its best to determine
<br>"how much they collect and where it goes" while not
<br>alienating charities or their benefactors, some of whom have
<br>considerable influence. The problem, he said, is cash
<br>transactions. O'Brien agreed that charity is an integral and
<br>important part of society and therefore needs to be
<br>safeguarded. O'Brien noted that the diversion of funds
<br>remains an important vulnerability for charities and
<br>reiterated the importance of these external oversight
<br>efforts. He added that of additional concern are charities
<br>that provide funding or support on behalf of terrorist
<br>organizations. O'Brien went on to stress the importance of
<br>monitoring both the front and back-end of charitable giving.
<br>He urged the need to vet organizations and recipients on the
<br>ground and work with charities to implement sound reporting
<br>and oversight mechanisms on the back-end.
<br>
<br>¶10. (S/NF) xxxxxxxxxxxx outlined ongoing efforts (ref F) to
<br>ensure the integrity of charitable work by increasing GOK
<br>oversight. He highlighted four alternative donation
<br>collection initiatives -- SMS, using K-net for electronic
<br>transfers, opening small offices in malls staffed by a
<br>representative from an NGO and MOSAL, and setting up an
<br>ATM-like machine in which prospective donors can choose from
<br>a menu of projects -- designed to create an electronic record
<br>of all transactions that will enhance MOSAL and other GOK
<br>entities, ability to track funds. MOSAL has an ongoing
<br>dialogue with charities to increase the use of electronic
<br>collection methods creating a record MOSAL and other GOK
<br>entities can review, but he acknowledged that "it is not easy
<br>to get them to accept." "We are not happy with the progress,
<br>but at least they are starting to consider the options," he
<br>explained.
<br>
<br>¶11. (S/NF) Briefing MOSAL on ref A and passing ref B
<br>non-papers, O'Brien reiterated concern about RIHS activities
<br>and said that the USG is looking into taking domestic and UN
<br>action against these eight branches in the near future. In
<br>addressing O'Brien's concerns about RIHS activities abroad,
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx explained that while MOSAL oversees charitable
<br>operations inside Kuwait, it continues to rely on the MFA to
<br>oversee charities' external activities. External RIHS
<br>projects must be endorsed by both the host government and the
<br>local Kuwaiti Embassy before they receive GOK approval, as
<br>was the case in Bangladesh. He conceded, however, that this
<br>puts pressure on Kuwaiti embassy officials, especially those
<br>in Africa and Asia. xxxxxxxxxxxx thanked the USG for encouraging
<br>the exchange of information on RIHS noting that the GOK has
<br>been waiting for a response from the Russians for eight
<br>months. In response to the ref B non-paper on the three
<br>Kuwaiti terrorist facilitators, he noted that the GOK is
<br>aware of these individuals and is following this matter
<br>through an interagency committee. (Comment: This is the
<br>first we have heard of this committee. We will pursue with
<br>the GOK. End comment).
<br>
<br>Central Bank of Kuwait
<br>----------------------
<br>
<br>¶12. (SBU) xxxxxxxxxxxx lauded
<br>the increased awareness and vigilance of local banks as
<br>evidence of Kuwait,s commitment to combating financial
<br>
<br>Kuwait 00000808 005 of 007
<br>
<br>
<br>crime. Banks know that the GOK is serious and will enforce
<br>penalties, he explained. He added that CBK has also begun to
<br>receive inquiries from private citizens outside of the
<br>financial sector who are concerned about money laundering.
<br>
<br>¶13. (S/NF) Econoff asked xxxxxxxxxxxx about an April 22 report
<br>in Kuwaiti Arabic-language daily "Al-Watan" in which Bathali
<br>complained about his account being frozen per "instructions
<br>from the U.S. Department of Treasury." xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>confirmed that a local bank froze and will soon close
<br>Bathali,s account based on his inclusion in the Treasury
<br>OFAC List. However, he stressed that while his account will
<br>be closed, Bathali's funds will be returned to him.
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx emphasized that financial institutions in Kuwait
<br>take this matter very seriously because of both concern for
<br>their reputation and the impact on their relationship with
<br>the correspondent bank. (Comment: Post believes the local
<br>bank involved was the Kuwait Finance House. This has also
<br>been suggested in the Kuwaiti press. End comment.)
<br>
<br>Ministry of Finance:
<br>Kuwait is "Making Strides in AML/CTF"
<br>--------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶14. (C/NF) Briefing the Assistant Secretary on the GOK,s
<br>ongoing AML/CTF efforts,xxxxxxxxxxxx noted that the GOK is doing its best to counter
<br>money laundering and terrorist financing and has made
<br>tremendous strides in the last 10 years, outpacing some of
<br>its regional neighbors. He acknowledged that "there are
<br>cancers," but reiterated that the GOK can not take action
<br>based on rumors, and that documentation is required. In
<br>response, O'Brien passed the Ministers non-papers on RIHS and
<br>Jaber Al-Jalahmah, Hamid Al-Ali, and Mubarak Al-Bathali.
<br>
<br>¶15. (C/NF) Customs operations also fall under the purview of
<br>the Minister of Finance who noted that cash smuggling from
<br>Iraq and Iran continues to be a concern, particularly on the
<br>Iraq-Kuwait border because of volume and a lack of personnel.
<br>He looks forward to the May 2007 opening of the Khabari
<br>Crossing (ref C), aka K-Crossing -- which will be used
<br>exclusively by U.S. military, Coalition Forces, and military
<br>contractors going into and out of Iraq -- as it will take
<br>some of the pressure off the civilian crossing at Abdali.
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx disclosed that Turkey has requested permission
<br>for Turkish trucks to transit Kuwait. The GOK is unable to
<br>accommodate the request at this time due to the already heavy
<br>volume of traffic but he noted that the opening of K-Crossing
<br>may allow the GOK to reconsider.
<br>
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>Cash Couriers Continue to Be Problematic
<br>--------------------------------------------- -----
<br>
<br>¶16. (C/NF) O'Brien also met with xxxxxxxxxxxx, who outlined
<br>the various challenges facing Customs operations in Kuwait,
<br>particularly in light of continued instability in Iraq. A
<br>priority AML/CTF concern is cash smuggling which he said is
<br>caused, at least in part, by a ban on the export of currency
<br>from Iraq and Iran. xxxxxxxxxxxx noted that the bulk of these
<br>incidents seem to involve merchants who are trying to move
<br>their money in and out of closed markets and are not related
<br>to criminal/terror activity. To combat this trend, Kuwait
<br>has a disclosure system for inbound travelers requiring them
<br>to report currency in excess of KD 3000 (USD 10,000). In the
<br>proposed draft law, xxxxxxxxxxxx said that Kuwait will move to a
<br>declaration system. A reporting form is now in use at some
<br>land and sea borders, specifically those with Iraq and Iran,
<br>and will soon be in place at airports. xxxxxxxxxxxx said that
<br>signs would be placed in airports once approved by civil
<br>
<br>Kuwait 00000808 006 of 007
<br>
<br>
<br>aviation authorities.
<br>
<br>¶17. (C/NF) xxxxxxxxxxxx noted that communication with his Iraqi
<br>counterparts, whom he described as a fragmented group of
<br>individuals "representing their own party," is sporadic and
<br>dysfunctional at best. In contrast, the DG described
<br>communication with his Iranian counterparts as good, noting
<br>that bilateral meetings are held at least twice a year.
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx welcomed continued cooperation with the U.S. and
<br>suggested that USG sponsorship of a GCC conference on AML/CTF
<br>with representatives from various government agencies --
<br>Customs, MOI, Justice, Finance, etc. -- would be an
<br>appropriate next step. Customs officials already have a
<br>formal network to exchange ideas, he explained, but as the
<br>nature of these issues requires a multifaceted approach an
<br>expanded forum would be beneficial. "In the Gulf these cases
<br>are seen as the responsibility of MOI, but Customs should be
<br>more engaged because Customs is the first line of defense,"
<br>he concluded. O'Brien noted that evidence shows that as
<br>governments limit the AML/CTF vulnerabilities in the formal
<br>financial sector, terrorist and other criminals turn to other
<br>less regulated avenues, including cash. He commended Customs
<br>for its efforts to date and reiterated that cash declaration
<br>programs play a key role in combating illicit activity.
<br>O'Brien offered technical assistance and discussed the
<br>successful DHS/ICE cash courier training in the Philippines
<br>and proposed a similar training in Kuwait. He suggested that
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx contact the DHS/ICE Attach on how to move forward.
<br>(Note: O'Brien did not pass ref A or B non-papers during
<br>this meeting. End note.)
<br>
<br>Draft Terror Finance Law:
<br>Still Undergoing Technical Review
<br>---------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶18. (C/NF) In response to A/S O'Brien's concerns about the
<br>failure to criminalize terrorist financing in the current GOK
<br>money laundering law, multiple interlocutors indicated that
<br>the draft amendment to the law would include such language
<br>and was reviewed by the National Committee's (NC) Technical
<br>Committee on April 23. The revised draft should be presented
<br>to the National Committee Chairman, the CBK Governor, soon.
<br>The Governor will then forward the draft to the Cabinet who
<br>will in turn pass it to Parliament's Legal Committee. Once
<br>it passes the Committee, it will be presented to the full
<br>Parliament. xxxxxxxxxxxx noted that the
<br>Technical Committee plans to actively lobby MPs to facilitate
<br>the draft's timely passage. xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>said Committee members are united on the merits of the new
<br>draft which included two key enhancements to the FIU: 1) The
<br>FIU will receive SARs directly, and 2) Kuwait's FIU will be
<br>able to exchange information with other FIUs. (Note: The
<br>GOK has chosen not to share a copy with the USG, but says the
<br>current draft criminalizes terror financing, includes a
<br>provision to require both inbound and outbound declarations
<br>of cash, and allows the FIU, not the OPP, to directly receive
<br>SARs. A similar provision on cash declarations was taken out
<br>of the 2002 AML draft law. End note.)
<br>
<br>¶19. (C/NF) O'Brien lauded the proposed amendments and
<br>explained that changes to the structure and function of the
<br>FIU are required for Egmont group membership. He also
<br>offered USG assistance and comments on the draft law. When
<br>asked for his assessment of AML/CTF regimes in the region,
<br>O'Brien noted that, although some countries are still working
<br>to criminalize terrorist financing, the legal framework has
<br>developed rapidly in a relatively short period of time. The
<br>focus now should shift toward implementation and capacity
<br>building as the GOK and others focus on acquiring the
<br>resources and abilities to enforce the new regimes.
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx also asked about the availability of a list for
<br>
<br>Kuwait 00000808 007 of 007
<br>
<br>
<br>money laundering and narcotics offenders. O'Brien noted that
<br>while no such list exists for money laundering, the GOK can
<br>subscribe to Worldcheck and other services that track UN,
<br>OFAC, and public data like criminal charges. He further
<br>noted that the USG has a narcotics Kingpin List, aka the
<br>Clinton list, for narcotics indictments.
<br>
<br>¶20. (SBU) A/S O'Brien cleared this cable.
