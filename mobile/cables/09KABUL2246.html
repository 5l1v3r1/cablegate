<br>
<br>REF: REFTEL KABUL 02245
<br>
<br>Classified By: DEPUTY AMBASSADOR FRANCIS J. RICCIARDONE FOR REASONS 1.4
<br>(B) AND (D)
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) SUMMARY: On numerous occasions we have emphasized with
<br>Attorney General Aloko the need to end interventions by him
<br>and President Karzai, who both authorize the release of
<br>detainees pre-trial and allow dangerous individuals to go
<br>free or re-enter the battlefield without ever facing an
<br>Afghan court.  On July 29th, Legal Adviser Harold Hongju Koh
<br>and Deputy Ambassador Frances Ricciardone demarched Attorney
<br>General Muhammad Ishaq Aloko about our concern over pre-trial
<br>releases and presidential pardons of narco-traffickers
<br>(Reftel Kabul 02245) In Spring 2008, Post had previous
<br>demarched National Security Advisor Rassoul about our concern
<br>over pre-trial releases.  Despite our complaints and
<br>expressions of concern to the GIRoA, pre-trial releases
<br>continue. END SUMMARY
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) Transfers from Bagram Theatre Internment Facility
<br>(BTIF) to the Afghan National Detention Facility (ANDF) began
<br>in Spring 2007.  During that year, there was only one
<br>pre-trial release.  In 2008, there were 104 pre-trial
<br>releases, almost all of which took place after President
<br>Karzai formed the Aloko Detainee Commission in April 2008.
<br>From January to March of 2009, there were 12 pre-trial
<br>releases; and 23 pre-trial releases between April and June
<br>¶2009.  So far in July 2009, there have been 10 pre-trial
<br>releases.
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) An August 2005 exchange of diplomatic notes between
<br>the USG and the GIRoA provides the legal basis for the
<br>GIRoA,s detention and prosecution of detainees transferred
<br>into Afghan custody. Even though a multi-agency GIRoA
<br>delegation under the Aloko Detainee Commission screens all
<br>BTIF detainees who are transferred to the ANDF and assures
<br>the USG that these detainees will be prosecuted in an Afghan
<br>court, there have been 150 detainees released from the ANDF
<br>without trial since 2007, including 29 former Guantanamo Bay
<br>(GTMO) detainees.  The total number of transfers to date from
<br>BTIF to ANDF is 629 detainees, plus 41 from GTMO.

<br>PROTECTION OF NARCOTRAFFICKERS
<br>-------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) In April, President Karzai pardoned five border
<br>policemen who were caught with 124 kilograms of heroin in
<br>their border police vehicle. The policemen, who have come to
<br>be known as the   Zahir Five,, were tried, convicted and
<br>sentenced to terms of 16 to 18 years each at the Central
<br>Narcotics Tribunal. But President Karzai pardoned all five of
<br>them on the grounds that they were distantly related to two
<br>individuals who had been martyred during the civil war.
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) Separately, President Karzai tampered with the
<br>narcotics case of Haji Amanullah, whose father is a wealthy
<br>businessman and one of his supporters. Without any
<br>constitutional authority, Karzai ordered the police to
<br>conduct a second investigation which resulted in the
<br>conclusion that the defendant had been framed. XXXXXXXXXXXXX told
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX he was   ashamed,, of the president for his
<br>interference in this case and the case of the Zahir Five.
<br>
<br>¶6. (S) In another case, a CJTF investigation concluded that
<br>26 kilograms of heroin seized from a vehicle search belonged
<br>to Col. Jaweed, Chief of the Highway Police for Badakshan
<br>Province. Jaweed is the nephew of a powerful member of
<br>Parliament. Eventually, he was arrested and is currently
<br>serving in Pol-i-Charkhi prison. But, there is credible, but
<br>unconfirmed, intelligence indicating that President Karzai
<br>has signed a letter pardoning Jaweed that has not yet been
<br>delivered to the Supreme Court. Daudzai denied any
<br>significant pressure in this case.
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) Unconfirmed intelligence also indicates that President
<br>Karzai is planning to release drug trafficker Ismal Safed,
<br>who is serving a 19-year sentence in Pol-i-Charkhi. Safed is
<br>a priority DEA target who was arrested in 2005 in possession
<br>of large quantities of heroin and a cache of weapons. In
<br>2008, DEA conducted an operation in which an undercover
<br>officer purchased approximately three kilograms of heroin
<br>directly from Safed. Daudzai told the Deputy Ambassador that
<br>President Karzai will not pardon Safed, and that Post,s
<br>concerns about this case will reaffirm President Karzai,s
<br>decision not to interfere.
