<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY. President Hugo Chavez appears determined to
<br>enact a series of controversial laws covering the electoral
<br>process, education, social property, and the criminal penal
<br>code that are vital tenets of his Bolivarian Revolution and
<br>would further consolidate his power. Many of the laws are
<br>repackaged from previous failed legislative efforts that
<br>proved too unpopular with the Venezuelan electorate. Chavez
<br>likely calculates that now is the time to move forward
<br>aggressively and take advantage of the fact that many
<br>Venezuelans are unaware of the practical significance of the
<br>legislation or may dismiss it as just one more debate in the
<br>ongoing dispute between Chavez and the opposition.
<br>Additionally, he may be trying to pass the series of
<br>unpopular laws in short order and bank on the fact that
<br>voters will have accommodated to the new situation by the
<br>time elections roll around next year. The opposition will be
<br>hard pressed to rally its troops against laws that have yet
<br>to be implemented and are hard to comprehend, especially
<br>during the summer lull when university students and many in
<br>the opposition are on vacation. Chavez can be expected to
<br>apply these laws selectively against a limited number of
<br>individuals and institutions as an example to the rest. END
<br>SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>-------------------------------------------
<br>ACCELERATING THE REVOLUTION BECAUSE HE CAN
<br>-------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Speaking at an event on July 25 commemorating the
<br>10-year anniversary of the National Assembly's effort to
<br>rewrite Venezuela's constitution, Chavez said he is willing
<br>to rule by decree to push through new "revolutionary" laws,
<br>and called on legislators to accelerate the country's path to
<br>socialism. These controversial laws cover issues such as the
<br>electoral process, education, social property, and the
<br>criminal code that would allow the government further control
<br>of almost all aspects of Venezuelan life. Contacts in the
<br>political opposition and local academic community had already
<br>expected the National Assembly to pass these laws in the
<br>coming months to take advantage of the summer lull when most
<br>Venezuelans are focused on their vacations. They tell us
<br>that because Chavez already has total control of the rubber
<br>stamp Assembly, the manner of how the laws are enacted is not
<br>as important as the fact that he is determined to enact them.
<br>Chavez has called for the passage of all of these laws by
<br>December 15, the 10-year anniversary of the enactment of the
<br>country's "Bolivarian" constitution.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) The electoral law would limit the ability of small
<br>political parties to claim legislative seats at all levels of
<br>government and would almost certainly increase Chavez's
<br>chances of retaining a majority in the National Assembly
<br>after elections expected in late 2010. This law would appear
<br>to weaken previous safeguards on the transparency of the
<br>electoral process and secrecy of the vote and would give
<br>unprecedented discretion to the Chavez-dominated National
<br>Electoral Council. The education law (REFTEL) is expected to
<br>further politicize the official curriculum along socialist
<br>lines and make it harder for independent minded teachers and
<br>administrators to obtain jobs in public schools. The social
<br>property law has been dubbed the "Cuban Law" by critics who
<br>claim the new rule would allow the government to expropriate
<br>individual homes and businesses. The penal code reform would
<br>expand state control over criminal proceedings and, most
<br>controversially, require banks and telecommunications
<br>companies to record and make available to state officials all
<br>phone calls, emails, and banking transactions in Venezuela.
<br>We will report on all of these laws in more detail via
<br>SEPTEL.
<br>
<br>-------------------
<br>BACK TO THE FUTURE
<br>-------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) Many of the "new" laws currently in front of the
<br>National Assembly are vital tenets of Chavez's Bolivarian
<br>Revolution but are repackaged from the unsuccessful December
<br>2007 referendum and other failed legislative efforts that
<br>proved too unpopular with the Venezuelan electorate. A 2001
<br>proposal to reform the country's under-performing education
<br>system galvanized the opposition, led to massive street
<br>demonstrations by parents, teachers, and school
<br>administrators, and was one of the catalysts for the April
<br>
<br>CARACAS 00000982 002.2 OF 002
<br>
<br>
<br>2002 coup. The penal code reform contains the spirit of the
<br>deeply unpopular "Ley Sapo" (Snitch Law) that Chavez passed
<br>by decree in May 2008 and then subsequently revoked due to
<br>public backlash. Elements of the social property law were
<br>first proposed as a modification to the constitution that was
<br>defeated in the December 2007 referendum. Critics say the
<br>National Assembly wants to appear to be introducing less
<br>radical versions of the laws to tamp down potential adverse
<br>public reaction.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Our contacts admit that the opposition will not be
<br>able to organize itself formally to protest these impending
<br>laws until at least October when university students return
<br>to campus and Venezuelans are back from vacation. They add
<br>that Chavez has a track record of passing controversial laws
<br>during the summer months and likely judges that the initial
<br>outcry after the laws are passed will long be forgotten by
<br>the time of National Assembly elections scheduled for late
<br>next year. Noted Venezuelan pollster Luis Vicente Leon told
<br>poloffs on July 21 that there has been no public backlash
<br>against the pending legislation because opposition media
<br>outlets have relatively little penetration among the
<br>populace, and therefore most Venezuelans are not aware of
<br>what the Assembly is about to pass. He said this is why
<br>Chavez has been cracking down on radio stations in recent
<br>weeks; these stations have a wider reach among Venezuelans,
<br>and Chavez must target these outlets to keep awareness low
<br>and to better control his message.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Leon's comments echoed those of other academics and
<br>opposition party officials who note that both the penal code
<br>and the electoral law are complicated issues that many
<br>Venezuelans do not understand, or may dismiss as simply
<br>another dispute in the ongoing battle between the opposition
<br>and the Chavez government. COPEI Secretary General Alejandro
<br>Vivas confirmed to Poloffs in mid-July that the opposition
<br>will not be able to do much more than take note of and
<br>monitor the laws' passage before trying to mount a more
<br>organized opposition this fall. Nevertheless, he highlighted
<br>the importance of challenging these laws through legal and
<br>institutional means. He noted that even though state
<br>institutions are effectively subservient to the executive
<br>branch, these institutions will be around after Chavez leaves
<br>office, and the opposition needs to be on record doing what
<br>they can to challenge these laws through all means at their
<br>disposal.
<br>
<br>-------
<br>COMMENT
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Chavez is a savvy politician skilled at calibrating
<br>and re-calibrating his political strategy to advance
<br>controversial legislation and achieve his policy goals.
<br>Whether because of worsening economic conditions, the absence
<br>of a viable political rival, or a time period of about a year
<br>before the next scheduled elections, Chavez likely calculates
<br>that now is the time to move forward aggressively to
<br>implement his agenda and accelerate his revolution. The laws
<br>currently in front of the Assembly represent some of the most
<br>controversial legislation of Chavez's rule, but they also
<br>form the backbone of his political ideology. In attempting
<br>to pass these laws in short order, Chavez runs the risk of
<br>going too far too fast, but his likely selective
<br>implementation against a limited number of individuals and
<br>institutions may help maintain complacency among the
<br>Venezuelan electorate. The opposition is very worried about
<br>the impending legislation, but they will be hard pressed to
<br>rally more than pro forma opposition to laws that have yet to
<br>be implemented, are difficult to comprehend, and are easily
<br>lost among the constant din of Chavez's "revolution."
