<br>TAGS: PTER MOPS PK
<br>SUBJECT: TERRORISTS INCREASE ACTIVITY IN ADVANCE OF 
<br>WAZIRISTAN OPERATION 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Anne W. Patterson. Reasons 1.4 b and d. 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) Summary: With the Pakistan military preparing to 
<br>launch an operation against major terrorist safe havens in 
<br>South Waziristan, Pakistan's terrorist/extremist groups have 
<br>dramatically increased their militant and propaganda 
<br>operations in an effort to undermine public support. On the 
<br>operational side, the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) now 
<br>headed by an individual calling himself Hakeemullah Mehsud 
<br>appears to be cooperating both with elements of al-Qaeda and 
<br>with the Punjabi terrorist organization Lashkar-e-Jhangvi 
<br>(LJ). While this is not the first time that we have seen 
<br>cross-cooperation among these terrorist/extremist 
<br>organizations, the intensity of attacks -- five in a single 
<br>day on October 15 -- indicate that TTP has both increased its 
<br>cooperative outreach and its finances (as LJ does not work 
<br>for free). 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) In addition, the recent attacks demonstrate that TTP 
<br>and its allies have the capacity to evolve and vary the style 
<br>of their attacks to exploit weaknesses in the Pakistani 
<br>security apparatus. The recent attacks involved both 
<br>vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs) in the 
<br>North West Frontier Province and smaller attacks against high 
<br>profile installations by armed individuals in security forces 
<br>uniforms that can more easily penetrate Pakistan security 
<br>cordons in other parts of the country. There is information 
<br>to suggest that women/men clad in burqas are now part of the 
<br>mix of attackers. TTP has been clear in its propaganda that 
<br>these attacks are both in direct retaliation for Pakistan 
<br>government support for American initiatives in countering 
<br>violent extremism and because of the military's upcoming 
<br>Waziristan operation. TTP has gone so far as to promise an 
<br>end to the attacks and its fighters participation in jihad 
<br>against India, if the Pakistani government changes its 
<br>foreign policy and establishes an "Islamic" state. Despite 
<br>these threats, the Pakistan military continues its 
<br>preparations for an offensive in South Waziristan against the 
<br>TTP and their tribal allies to be launched in the next few 
<br>weeks. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) Beginning with the attack against the Askari Bank in 
<br>Peshawar on September 26, the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) 
<br>has resumed its terrorist attacks in Pakistan's settled areas 
<br>that had largely ceased following the death of Baitullah 
<br>Mehsud. TTP's new campaign coincides with Pakistan military 
<br>preparations for an operation in South Waziristan, including 
<br>increased air strikes in Mehsud territory and with the 
<br>consolidation of leadership power within TTP in the hands of 
<br>an individual referring to himself as Hakeemullah Mehsud. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) TTP and its al-Qaeda allies, who have been providing 
<br>advice and logistical assistance to the organization in 
<br>exchange for shelter with the Mehsud tribe in South 
<br>Waziristan, appear to have timed their renewed spate of 
<br>attacks and the accompanying propaganda blitz to undermine 
<br>public confidence in Pakistan security forces just as 
<br>preparations for the South Waziristan operation were 
<br>increasing. The terrorists appear to have read in on modern 
<br>theories of asymmetrical warfare, including the tenet that 
<br>public support will help determine the outcome of the 
<br>struggle between government and anti-government actors. 
<br>General Kayani told us repeatedly that strong public support 
<br>was a key issue in his decision to move into Swat. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) TTP is not, however, acting alone in carrying out the 
<br>recent attacks. Al-Qaeda advice, support, and possibly 
<br>financing have long been a critical element in TTP's ability 
<br>to carry-out spectacular attacks in Pakistan's settled areas. 
<br>In addition, TTP has allied on and off with various other 
<br>Taliban-inspired terrorist and criminal groups in Pakistan's 
<br>North West Frontier Province, including Mengal Bagh and the 
<br>Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat Mohammadi (TNSM). 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S) In the recent attacks in the Pakistani Punjab, TTP 
<br>appears to have, as they did in 2008, hired the services of 
<br>Punjab-based terrorist group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LJ). LJ, 
<br>which began as a violent off-shot of Deobandi sectarian 
<br>extremist group Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP) in the 1990s, 
<br>has steadily increased its target set from strictly Shias, a 
<br>minority in Pakistan, to any group which does not share its 
<br>strict, militant interpretation of Islam, including the 
<br>Pakistan government and western interests. Since 2001, LJ 
<br>has become essentially a "guns for hire" terrorist 
<br>organization, prepared to carry out attacks on any 
<br>non-Deobandi group in exchange for sizable cash payments. 
<br>The latest attacks are also tied directly to Ilyas Kashmiri, 
<br>who is affiliated with the anti-India terrorist group 
<br>Harakat-ul-Jihad-e-Islami (HUJI). HUJI, along with other 
<br>anti-India groups including Lashkar-e-Tayyaba (LeT) and 
<br>Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), have increasingly shifted their focus 
<br>to include Pakistan government and western targets in 
<br>Pakistan and India. They are also actively collaborating 
<br>with Taliban groups, including TTP, sectarian extremist 
<br>groups such as LJ, and al-Qaeda. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) The recent attacks demonstrate that TTP and its allied 
<br>groups are capable of adjusting their tactics and practices 
<br>to counter Pakistan government security measures. TTP has 
<br>continued to use vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices 
<br>(VBIED) against police and government installations in NWFP 
<br>-- where counter-measures are comparatively weaker. In 
<br>Rawalpindi, Islamabad, and Lahore, TTP has started deploying 
<br>single suicide bombers or small teams of suicide bombers and 
<br>armed gunmen to target high-profile installations. These 
<br>individual suicide bombers or small teams have begun wearing 
<br>the uniforms of Pakistani security personnel, which are 
<br>easily available for purchase in any market and allow them to 
<br>bypass security screening checkpoints unchallenged. There is 
<br>information that women/men in burqas have also been part of 
<br>the mix of attackers. While casualty tolls in these attacks 
<br>are lower than in the VBIED explosions, their ability to 
<br>bypass security and penetrate into the General Headquarters 
<br>of the Pakistan Army, international organizations, and the 
<br>headquarters of the Federal Investigation Agency could have a 
<br>devastating impact on public and security force morale. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (S) It is also possible, however, that the terrorists have 
<br>not accurately assessed all quarters of Pakistani public 
<br>opinion. Most Punjabis were remarkably nonchalant about 
<br>violence in the tribal areas prior to the March attack on the 
<br>Sri Lankan cricket team in Lahore. Consulate Lahore contacts 
<br>have fallen into two camps in reaction to the October 15 (and 
<br>earlier but also recent) attacks in the Punjab. One camp 
<br>does, indeed, bemoan the government's incapacity and speaks 
<br>pessimistically about the GOP's capacity to rally. Another 
<br>camp speaks passionately of the importance of the GOP's 
<br>civilian and military components joining to defeat the 
<br>terrorists, and restore normalcy to Pakistan, with some pride 
<br>in the GOP's accomplishments to date. The attacks seem to 
<br>have further invigorated this camp. Both camps insist that 
<br>the violent extremists represent neither Islam nor Pakistan. 
<br>Terrorist "messaging" is not having the desired impact in 
<br>Lahore. Even the anti-U.S., nationalist daily "The Nation" 
<br>spoke highly of the "martyred" security forces who lost their 
<br>lives in the October 15 attacks. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (S) In addition to the increase in attacks, TTP has 
<br>equally launched a propaganda effort to break public support 
<br>for the impending operation in South Waziristan. The thrust 
<br>of this propaganda effort has been that the attacks are in 
<br>retaliation for the Pakistan Army/government's policy of 
<br>supporting America's "war against Islam" in Pakistan and 
<br>Afghanistan. TTP has stressed that any action in Waziristan 
<br>is being carried out on instructions from the United States. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (S) TTP spokespeople have promised that the campaign of 
<br>attacks will end, if the Pakistan government abandons its 
<br>support of the United States policy. In one recent 
<br>statement, TTP even offered to send its jihadi forces to 
<br>Pakistan's eastern border with India if the Pakistan 
<br>government turned Pakistan into "an Islamic state." Such 
<br>propaganda messages are clearly designed to damage the army 
<br>and government's image in the general public and decrease 
<br>public and political support for what may be a prolonged 
<br>military operation in South Waziristan. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (S) Despite these attacks, we continue to receive solid 
<br>evidence that the Pakistan military is preparing to move 
<br>forward with some kind of operation in South Waziristan. For 
<br>the last several days, we have witnessed renewed air strikes 
<br>in the region designed to prepare the ground to facilitate 
<br>offensive maneuver. In addition, we have seen continued 
<br>movements of troops and supplies to tactical assembly areas 
<br>in South Waziristan and the positioning of Special Services 
<br>Group (SSG) personnel for reconnaissance activities, which 
<br>appear imminent. On October 16, Chief of Army Staff Ashfaq 
<br>Pervaiz Kayani made an unscheduled call to ISAF Commander 
<br>Gen. McChrystal to advise that operations in South Waziristan 
<br>were imminent and to request that ISAF forces in Afghanistan 
<br>coordinate with the Pakistani military to prevent the escape 
<br>of militants across the border. Mission believes that the 
<br>start of major ground combat operations may still be several 
<br>days or more away as SSG reconnaissance and additional air 
<br>strikes are likely prior to the commencement of decisive 
<br>operations. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (S) Despite the positive indications that the Pakistan 
<br>Army intends to move into South Waziristan, post remains 
<br>uncertain as to the intended extent of the operation. There 
<br>is no question that the Pakistan Army intends to "punish" the 
<br>Mehsud tribe for its protection of TTP and to dismantle as 
<br>much TTP infrastructure in South Waziristan as possible. It 
<br>is also likely that the Pakistan Army will move against 
<br>al-Qaeda elements that are inter-mingled with the Mehsud 
<br>tribe and supporting TTP. It remains to be seen, however, 
<br>that given the short time frame before a harsh winter sets 
<br>into the Waziristans that the Pakistan Army is contemplating 
<br>a full-scale clearance operation. There is no indication 
<br>that the military intends to go after Commander Nazir, 
<br>Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the Haqqani network, or their allied 
<br>tribes -- all located in North Waziristan -- as part of this 
<br>operation. These elements that focus almost exclusively on 
<br>cross-border attacks into Afghanistan are not a high priority 
<br>for the Pakistan military, and, in the case of the Haqqanis, 
<br>it is not clear the Pakistani military could achieve a 
<br>decisive victory even if it wanted to do so.
