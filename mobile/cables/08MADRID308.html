<br>Classified By: Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) Summary. The Bank of Spain, Spain's central bank,
<br>provided to post on March 7 a document summarizing activities
<br>that Bank Santander and Bank Sabadell have had or still have
<br>with Iran. The document is based on information the Bank of
<br>Spain received from the two banks on March 6 in response to
<br>concerns raised by Treasury Deputy Secretary Kimmitt March 5.
<br>The document provides the most up-to-date information that
<br>any of post's sections has on these banks' relationships with
<br>Iranian banks. Bank Santander says it has taken steps to
<br>eliminate almost all of its activities in Iran, while
<br>Sabadell says it maintains its Tehran representative office
<br>in support of Spanish businesses but employs extremely
<br>stringent controls to guard against association with
<br>sanctioned entities. Para 6 contains the full text of the
<br>document. Post is seeking clarification on various points.
<br>End Summary.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C/NF) Treasury Deputy Secretary Kimmitt raised in several
<br>of his meetings and public appearances in Madrid March 5-7
<br>(reftels) the danger to Spanish banks of maintaining links
<br>with Iranian banks. According to the February edition of
<br>Bankers Almanac, two Spanish banks, Santander and Sabadell,
<br>maintained correspondent relationships with Iranian banks:
<br>Santander with the Export Development Bank of Iran, Bank
<br>Melli (cited in UNSCR 1803), and Bank Sepah; and Sabadell
<br>with the Export Development Bank of Iran and Bank Refah.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C/NF) In Deputy Secretary Kimmitt's March 5 meeting with
<br>Bank of Spain (central bank) Deputy Governor Jose Vinals (ref
<br>a), Vinals promised to have the Bank's banking supervision
<br>office discuss with Santander and Sabadell their
<br>relationships with Iranian banks. At a March 6 lunch, the
<br>President of Sabadell confirmed to the Deputy Secretary that
<br>the central bank had spoken with his bank that morning. On
<br>March 7, the Bank of Spain provided post with a document
<br>summarizing information that Sabadell and Santander conveyed
<br>to the Bank of Spain concerning their ties with Iranian
<br>banks.
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) This document contains information that is more
<br>recent than information post has from other sources, and is
<br>fully or almost fully consistent with the earlier information
<br>in refs e-f. Santander says it has almost entirely closed
<br>down its operations in Iran, save for an account with Iran's
<br>central bank (Markazi) and other residual activities. Post
<br>is pursuing clarification on these residual activities.
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) Bank Sabadell provided the Bank of Spain extensive
<br>detail on its controls and its interactions with Iranian
<br>banks, including correspondent relationships with more banks
<br>than those named in Bankers Almanac, one of which (Melli) was
<br>cited in UNSCR 1803. Bank Sabadell continues to operate a
<br>representative office in Iran to assist its Spanish clients
<br>in their export/import activities, but with what it says are
<br>very stringent controls to guard against interaction with
<br>prohibited entities. Post is following up to further clarify
<br>Sabadell's relationships with Iranian banks.
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) The informal translation of the Bank of Spain
<br>document follows:
<br>
<br>INFORMATION COMMUNICATED BY BANK SANTANDER (TO BANK OF SPAIN)
<br>
<br>1) For 25 years, Bank Santander has maintained a small
<br>Representative Office in Tehran with three or four
<br>employees. Currently, the work of the said office is
<br>practically null based on the Santander Group's decision
<br>in the fall of 2007 to sever business relations with
<br>Iranian banks. However, the office has not yet been
<br>closed, among other reasons because the representative is
<br>still helping them (note: it is not clear who "them" is)
<br>to end the activity in an orderly manner.
<br>
<br>2) All the accounts with Iranian banks, except Markazi
<br>(the central bank of Iran) have been closed. The
<br>accounts with Banks Sepah and Saderat were closed down in
<br>April, 2007, and the rest of the accounts were closed
<br>before the end of 2007. In the case of Bank Sepah,
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000000 002.2 OF 004
<br>
<br>
<br>Sepah's funds were frozen, based on EC Rules 423/2007 of
<br>April 19 and 441/2007 of April 20. SEPBLAC (Spain's FIU)
<br>and the Ministry of Economy and Finance,s Directorate
<br>General of the Treasury were promptly notified of these
<br>actions.
<br>
<br>3) In the past, (Santander) operations were always
<br>entirely commercial in nature and practically all covered
<br>by CESCE (Spain's official export credit guarantee
<br>company). Additionally, there were interbank deposits
<br>primarily from bank Markazi with Santander's treasury in
<br>Madrid. Santander's decision taken the last quarter of
<br>2007 was to reduce to zero commercial activity with Iran,
<br>including deposits and any other services. The deposits,
<br>including those from bank Markazi, have not been renewed
<br>past their expiration dates. Operations were always
<br>subject to money laundering and terrorism finance
<br>prevention procedures. Currently, supervision of
<br>residual banking activities is being undertaken with
<br>extreme care.
<br>
<br>4) There are some long-term operations that still
<br>exist that were initiated before the decision to cut ties
<br>with Iranian banks were made and that cannot be
<br>cancelled.
<br>
<br>5) Between August 2006 and April 2007, Santander
<br>exchanged numerous letters with the SEC (Division of
<br>Corporate Finance - Office of Global Security Risk) in
<br>which Santander gave detailed information about its
<br>representative office and about its activities in Iran.
<br>The SEC initially requested that Santander's 20-F include
<br>a warning notice about its relationship with certain
<br>(Iranian) banks. Finally, when Santander decided to cut
<br>relations and shut down the accounts of Sepah and
<br>Saderat, the SEC appeared satisfied with this action and
<br>it was deemed unnecessary that Santander include a notice
<br>in its 20-F.
<br>
<br>
<br>INFORMATION COMMUNICATED BY BANK SABADELL
<br>
<br>Representative Office in Iran
<br>
<br>Banco Sabadell has a representative office in Iran,
<br>located at Ahmad Ghasir, Bucarest Ave, Tehran. On
<br>October 2, 1998, Bank Sabadell applied to Bank Markazi
<br>Jomhouri Islami Iran to open the office, and it was
<br>approved on November 2, 1998. The office was officially
<br>inaugurated on November 1, 1999.
<br>
<br>The mission of the branch is to assist solvent and well-
<br>known Spanish businesses - businesses that are clients
<br>from (Bank Sabadell's) domestic network in Spain - in
<br>their efforts to develop foreign trade with Iran.
<br>(following sentence underlined) A representative office
<br>does not undertake any type of banking operations.
<br>
<br>The office develops commercial activities with:
<br>
<br>- Spanish businesses with affiliates in Iran
<br>- Spanish businesses exporting products and/or
<br>services to Iran
<br>- Spanish businesses importing Iranian products or
<br>services
<br>- Spanish businesses without a permanent physical
<br>presence in Iran during their business trips to Iran
<br>
<br>The services offered are:
<br>
<br>- Advising clients on their official credit projects
<br>- Assistance with commercial financing
<br>- Banking advice related to foreign investment
<br>- Local support to Spanish businesses participating in
<br>sectoral or multi-sectoral commercial missions
<br>- Monitoring and coordination of business of clients
<br>in Iran
<br>
<br>Type of Operations Conducted by Bank Sabadell
<br>
<br>Based on a very restrictive framework of the operations
<br>that any relationship with Iran can have, Bank Sabadell
<br>has limited its operations to those transactions (following
<br>phrase underlined) in which at least one of the parties
<br>involved is a direct and known client of Bank Sabadell
<br>itself. In other words, Sabadell does not carry out any
<br>kind of operation between persons or entities if none of
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000000 003.2 OF 004
<br>
<br>
<br>them are its clients. The funds movements the Bank can
<br>carry out consist solely of debiting or crediting the
<br>account of a client. (following sentence underlined)This
<br>restriction is applied rigorously to the correspondence
<br>regime,
<br>and Sabadell rejects payment orders to non-client third
<br>parties.
<br>Of those client activities centered on export and import,
<br>the majority (about 92 percent during 2007) (following phrase
<br>underlined) are import payments for petroleum from a large
<br>Spanish petroleum company.
<br>
<br>Controls
<br>
<br>The following controls are applied to all operations:
<br>
<br>1) Comparison of the parties involved in a given operation
<br>with the lists of blocked persons and entities. The
<br>lists used for this purpose are the OFAC, UN, and EU
<br>lists, which are periodically updated. Sabadell's
<br>Compliance Office monitors on a daily basis new measures
<br>and legislative actions relating to Iran at both the
<br>national and international (United States, EU, and UN)
<br>levels.
<br>
<br>Any type of relationship with entities on the
<br>abovementioned lists were cancelled whenever they occurred.
<br>
<br>2) For each documented operation, a certification is
<br>required from the client of the Bank that is the importer
<br>or exporter, in which it is expressly stated that the
<br>said merchandise is not subject to any restrictions or
<br>limitations, nor on the list of merchandise prohibited by
<br>regulations published by the European Union and other
<br>international organizations.
<br>
<br>3) Additionally, a new control was recently added and
<br>is already in the execution phase: for clients that
<br>maintain relationships with Iran, Bank Sabadell applies
<br>heightened scrutiny and attention with regards to the
<br>following areas: (i) knowledge about the Banco Sabadell
<br>client (ii) knowledge about its Iranian counterpart,
<br>(iii) knowledge about the commercial relationship and the
<br>destination of any goods that may be exported; and (iv)
<br>knowledge by our client is aware of the applicable norms
<br>related to commercial operations with Iran.
<br>
<br>Periodically, Bank Sabadell conducts a follow-up on
<br>clients that have had operations with Iran for an amount
<br>greater than 15,000 euros (annually) and ensures that
<br>these clients have been subjected to the rigorous
<br>scrutiny discussed in the paragraph above.
<br>
<br>4) The SIOPEIA anti-money laundering system of
<br>investigating suspicious operations also provides a
<br>greater penalty for all those operations in which an
<br>Iranian person or entity (national or resident) may be
<br>involved.
<br>
<br>All these measures are subjected to constant review to
<br>update them in compliance with new developments or new
<br>legislative measures.
