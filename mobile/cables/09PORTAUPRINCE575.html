<br>Classified By: Ambassador Janet A. Sanderson, reason 1.4(b) and (d).
<br>
<br>Summary and Introduction
<br>-------------------------
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Haitian President Rene Preval has now completed three
<br>years of his five year presidential mandate. Widely touted as
<br>the "transitional president" poised to lead Haiti into a new
<br>era of democracy and economic prosperity, he has had only
<br>modest success thus far. Haiti's problems are indeed
<br>daunting, and redressing them will take much more than a
<br>five-year term. However, Preval's particular world view, his
<br>personality and often indecisive and uncommunicative
<br>leadership style, coupled with Haiti's deeply divided
<br>political class and the devastating events of 2008, have
<br>conspired to defer, if not derail, forward movement here.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) That being said, Preval remains Haiti's indispensable
<br>man. Legitimately elected, still moderately popular, and
<br>likely the only politician capable of imposing his will on
<br>Haiti - if so inclined - Preval's role over the next 18
<br>months is critical. Dealing with Preval is a challenge,
<br>occasionally frustrating and sometimes rewarding. He is wary
<br>of change and suspicious of outsiders, even those who seek
<br>his success. Managing Preval will remain challenging during
<br>the remainder of his term yet doing so is key to our success
<br>and that of Haiti. We must continue to find creative ways to
<br>work with him, influence him, and encourage him to recapture
<br>the activism of his first year in office. Until he does,
<br>political change and economic progress, so necessary to
<br>Haiti's future, is likely to be incremental at best.
<br>
<br>The Politics of Personality
<br>----------------------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Preval's attitude towards his presidency has been
<br>shaped by both experience and personality. As Aristide's
<br>Prime Minister and successor, he was overshadowed by the more
<br>charismatic ex-priest. At our first meeting, Preval recounted
<br>that he was "the last stop after Tabarre (where Aristide
<br>lived) when visitors came", bitterly reminding me that many
<br>USG visitors barely had time to see him when he was
<br>president. Those slights still rankle. A retiring, complex
<br>personality, the president shares little. His inner circle
<br>has greatly constricted during the past two years, with key
<br>advisors including Bob Manuel, all but dropping out. His
<br>involvement with his fiancee, financial advisor Babette
<br>Delatour has colored many of his other relationships,
<br>according to friends, and caused an estrangement of sorts
<br>with his sister and one of his daughters.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Even those close to Preval concede that his
<br>chameleon-like character makes dealing with the president
<br>difficult. One close advisor calls it "the roller coaster
<br>that is Rene Preval." Personally engaging - even seductive -
<br>when he so wishes, Preval can be equally harsh with
<br>colleagues and others. Ministers, close advisors and others
<br>have felt the sting of his tongue, both in public and in
<br>private. Stubbornly holding to ideas long past their shelf
<br>life, he rarely welcomes dissenting opinions. His courting
<br>of Taiwan in 2006, which almost led to the Chinese blocking
<br>renewal of the MINUSTAH mandate in 2006, is a case in point.
<br>Preval is highly disinclined to delegate power or authority
<br>and even the smallest detail comes to his office for
<br>decision, a situation which has caused stress in his
<br>relationships with both his current and former prime
<br>ministers. Planning Minister Bellerive described to me a
<br>recent Cabinet meeting where the Prime Minister and the
<br>Cabinet presented a development plan for the long-suffering
<br>northern tier of the country. Preval ridiculed the idea and
<br>when confronted by a united ministerial front, walked out of
<br>the cabinet meeting and told his advisors to strike the
<br>proposal from the agenda.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Uncomfortable in formal settings such as summits and
<br>international conferences, Preval seeks personal
<br>"relationships of trust" with his interlocutors. Often
<br>unable to articulate exactly what he wants - except in the
<br>broadest of terms - Preval tends to view issues in black and
<br>white. Nonetheless, he expects a positive - and prompt
<br>response. That is particularly true of his dealings with the
<br>international community. He remains skeptical about the
<br>international community's commitment to his government's
<br>goals, for instance telling me that he is suspicious of how
<br>the Collier report will be used. He measures success with the
<br>international community - and the U.S.- in terms of positive
<br>response to his priorities, rather than according to some
<br>broader international benchmarks of success.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Nevertheless, Preval's stubborn and cautious nature
<br>has sometimes borne fruit. In his first year in office, he
<br>was widely praised for reaching out to Haitians of all
<br>political stripes and for attempting to bridge Haiti's
<br>massive political divides. He has shrewdly coopted major
<br>political rivals into his personal cabinet over the past two
<br>years and has, through patient diplomacy managed to get
<br>fractious parliamentary groupings to sit around the table
<br>working on issues ranging from the budget to privatization to
<br>the current minimum wage crisis. He believes strongly that
<br>without his intercession, the international community would
<br>have ignored the impact of the 2008 hurricanes on Haiti, and
<br>that his early efforts at negotiation and discussion with the
<br>gangs of Cite Soleil (which he often reminds me that I
<br>criticized at the time) set the stage for the successful
<br>MINUSTAH operation to clear the area.
<br>
<br>
<br>A Narrowing Circle?
<br>------------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Preval's seeming isolation in the palace during the
<br>past year is striking. Close friends report that they have
<br>little contact - and even less influence - with him. A
<br>businessman who was key to Preval's election said the last
<br>time that he talked to Preval, the president brushed him off.
<br>Shunning newspapers and radio, he has a friend in New York do
<br>a daily press summary for him; otherwise he freely admits
<br>that he neither reads nor listens to the news, either local
<br>or international. He uses one or two cell phones but rarely
<br>shares the numbers with his colleagues. He uses his email to
<br>communicate with family and close friends, but prefers to
<br>talk on the telephone. He seldom leaves the palace except to
<br>travel to his residence each evening and to the retreat he
<br>has bought for his fiancee in the mountains above Port au
<br>Prince.
<br>
<br>The Health Issue
<br>----------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Preval's occasionally erratic behavior over the past
<br>year has again sparked widespread rumors that he is suffering
<br>from the effects of his past prostate cancer or that he has
<br>resumed drinking. There is no indication that he is taking
<br>medicine that affects his judgment or temperament, but he has
<br>ignored suggestions from his inner circle, including that of
<br>Delatour, that he do complete medical check-up in the U.S. He
<br>has not been to Cuba for follow-up tests in more than a year.
<br>Preval has increased his alcoholic consumption and often
<br>attends a Petionville night club with friends, but during our
<br>social interaction I have never seen him drink to excess.
<br>Nonetheless, reports of heavy drinking are circulating
<br>widely.
<br>
<br>
<br>An Agenda deferred: Elections, Constitutional Reform, and
<br>Drugs
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---------------
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Preval has said that his agenda for his remaining
<br>years in office focuses on three interconnected issues:
<br>elections, constitutional reform, and drugs. He came late to
<br>the election issue, originally suggesting that the partial
<br>Senatorial elections be combined with the lower house polls
<br>scheduled for fall. He backed down in the face of
<br>international pressure, but also as he came to realize that
<br>he would have little success - or support - if he moved on
<br>constitutional reform without a fully functioning senate.
<br>Given the delays in moving this election forward, he no
<br>longer believes that he will see an overhaul of the
<br>constitution. He now expects to focus on two critical
<br>constitutional issues, dual nationality and government
<br>decentralization. He has angrily denied charges that he
<br>manipulated the electoral process through the CEP and its
<br>decision to exclude Lavalas to undermine an already weak
<br>legislature.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Preval's focus on comprehensive constitutional reform
<br>over the past year raised concerns about his ulterior
<br>motives. Many in Haiti's political class drew the conclusion
<br>that Preval was seeking a third term. The President's
<br>refusal to explicitly reject that possibility created
<br>confusion and uncertainty, but I view this development as
<br>highly unlikely. Nonetheless, concerns about Preval's
<br>intentions, coupled with deteriorating relations with
<br>parliament, and his cavalier treatment of major political
<br>parties has undermined consensus on constitutional reform and
<br>he seems now resigned to more limited changes.
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Preval's fixation on drug trafficking reflects both a
<br>growing frustration with the inflow of drugs into the
<br>country's political process and irritation that his
<br>government is unable to address something that could indeed
<br>pose a personal threat to his future after the presidency.
<br>Shunning all GOH responsibility for the problem, he looks to
<br>hand it over to us. He has yet to believe that we take his
<br>concerns seriously, and that has colored much of his dealings
<br>with us beyond the counternarcotics agenda.
<br>
<br>
<br>A not-always-helpful world view
<br>-------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Although Preval's presidency started off well, with
<br>the new president reaching out across the political spectrum
<br>in an effort to create a new political culture in the
<br>country, those efforts have now essentially stalled. The
<br>President, whether by inclination or design, has not fully
<br>developed a vision of Haiti's future. By turns determined or
<br>distracted, Preval is often reluctant to use the levers of
<br>power given to him by the office of the presidency. In one
<br>telling instance, he held off going public in the April riots
<br>until the presidency appeared to hang in the balance.
<br>Skeptical of friends from abroad, and cynical about his own
<br>political class's ability to effect change, Preval believes
<br>that it is best only to speak out after the deals are done.
<br>Pressing him to be more expansive and communicative has been,
<br>in my experience, counterproductive. At the same time, he is
<br>reluctant to let anyone else pick up the slack, and as a
<br>result, the political vacuum in Haiti is often filled by
<br>those who do not necessarily have the nation's best interests
<br>at heart.
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) There are those who argue that the April, 2008 riots
<br>so badly shook Preval's world view that he has become
<br>reluctant to act. We believe this is too simplistic an
<br>explanation. Preval was indeed unprepared for the riots in
<br>the street, but he used them to press some key objectives,
<br>including the removal of then-Prime Minister Jacques-Edouard
<br>Alexis. More to the point, I believe that the President's own
<br>style and outlook, his often unilateral decision-making
<br>style, his propensity to micromanage, and his essentially
<br>cynical (and often justified) view of the Haitian political
<br>process were, I believe, reinforced by what he saw in April,
<br>and he is looking for ways to ensure he is not caught
<br>unawares again.
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) Preval's old friends suggest that in many ways he
<br>remains the radical student who broke with his conservative
<br>father and spent his university days in the political
<br>maelstrom of 1960s Europe. While this may overstate the
<br>case, Preval remains essentially a nationalist politician in
<br>the Haitian sense of the word - suspicious of outsiders
<br>intentions and convinced that no one understands Haiti like
<br>he does. He often takes actions, such as publicly dismissing
<br>the results of the Washington Donors Conference or stalling
<br>elections, which could be construed as working at cross
<br>purposes with the U.S. Preval clearly believes that he can
<br>walk a fine line without losing U.S. or international
<br>community support. Here, however, he runs a risk. Although he
<br>briefly lived in the U.S., Preval does not truly understand
<br>Americans or the Washington policy environment - and he often
<br>ignores advisors who do.
<br>
<br>
<br>The After-Life
<br>--------------
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) Close friends speculate that many of Preval's actions
<br>during the past year - his rapprochement with Alexis and the
<br>Neptune faction of Lavalas, his obsession with constitutional
<br>reform, his anger over drug trafficker Guy Philippe, even his
<br>reactions to the April riots - stem from his very real fear
<br>that politics will prohibit him from returning to private
<br>life in Haiti after his presidency. Thus, they argue, his
<br>overriding goal is to orchestrate the 2011 presidential
<br>transition in such a way as to ensure that whoever is elected
<br>will allow him to go home unimpeded. Based on our
<br>conversations, this is indeed a matter that looms large for
<br>Preval. He has said to me on various occasions that he is
<br>worried about his life after the presidency, that he would
<br>not survive in exile. His concerns seem real, given Haiti's
<br>history, albeit somewhat overblown at this point in time.
<br>
<br>
<br>What It Means for Us
<br>---------------------
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) Preval and I entered on duty in our respective
<br>positions at pretty much the same time and we have enjoyed an
<br>interesting, if not always harmonious, relationship during
<br>the past three and a half years. During that period, I have
<br>found him somewhat isolated, less open to ideas and advice,
<br>and more reluctant to use the tools of his office to advance
<br>his agenda than in his first year in office. Some say that
<br>he is reverting to the do-nothing persona of his first term
<br>as president. Like much about Preval, the reality is somewhat
<br>more complicated. What is clear to me, however, is that
<br>Preval has yet to truly provide the strong, consistent
<br>leadership that Haiti's current circumstances demand. In
<br>other places, we could find ways to circumvent or overcome
<br>these weaknesses. Not so in Haiti. Given Haiti's strong
<br>tradition of presidential rule, the blurred constitutional
<br>lines of authority, and his own reluctance to delegate
<br>authority, I believe that Preval - and only Preval - will
<br>continue to set the rhythm and scope of change in Haiti. And
<br>while we may argue with him about pace and priorities, we
<br>will have to adapt to his rhythm. Dealing with Preval has
<br>never been easy. Yet he remains Haiti's indispensable man and
<br>he must succeed in passing this country to a new leadership
<br>in 2011. We therefore must continue to find creative,
<br>consistent ways to reinforce and maintain our engagement - at
<br>all levels of the USG - with Preval and to press him to move
<br>forward the important agenda of change that remains as yet
<br>unrealized here.
