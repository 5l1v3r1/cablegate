<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary and Comment: Continuing violent unrest in 
<br>France -- only now diminishing after thirteen intense days -- 
<br>has very publicly brought to light the ugly reality of 
<br>France's persistent failure to integrate its immigrant 
<br>population. Importantly, the violence has not taken on 
<br>religious overtones, nor have mainstream (or, as far as we 
<br>can detect, underground extremist) Muslim groups sought to 
<br>manipulate the situation to their own advantage. Indeed, the 
<br>Muslim establishment has been actively trying to calm the 
<br>unrest. The government response -- to reestablish order 
<br>while exercising restraint and to promise to address the 
<br>underlying issues of unemployment, education, and family 
<br>breakdown -- seems to be working for the moment. But any 
<br>longer-term solutions will depend on successfully tackling 
<br>the underlying issue of social exclusion -- in particular, 
<br>employment discrimination. This is likely to prove a 
<br>difficult challenge for any government given France's slow 
<br>economic growth and chronic unemployment problems. Changing 
<br>deep-seated attitudes will also be a daunting challenge. 
<br>Failure could push a largely unpoliticized minority 
<br>underclass to embrace the Islamic political extremism the 
<br>French fear most. End Summary and Comment. 
<br>
<br>Where We Are Now 
<br>---------------- 
<br>¶2. (SBU) Images of rampaging youth hurling Molotov cocktails 
<br>and defying French authorities have gripped France for the 
<br>past thirteen days. Although France is accustomed to a 
<br>certain level of violence (prior to the unrest, the country 
<br>averaged 80 car burnings daily), the numbers to date are 
<br>staggering: some 300 towns affected since the onset of 
<br>unrest, more than 6,600 cars burned, nearly 1,800 individuals 
<br>taken in for questioning, 11,500 police and gendarmes 
<br>deployed, and over 100 security agents injured. In response 
<br>to the violence, the GoF has invoked emergency measures used 
<br>only twice since their enactment fifty years ago, during the 
<br>war in Algeria. On the first night of the law's application, 
<br>curfews were implemented in parts of 25 different departments 
<br>and appear to have had some success. There were 617 cars 
<br>reported burned, 280 arrests, and violence reported in 196 
<br>towns overnight, as opposed to the 1,173 vehicles attacked, 
<br>330 people taken in for questioning, and 226 communities 
<br>reporting unrest the night before. Press reports indicate 
<br>that the suburbs ringing Paris were notably quieter November 
<br>8 in comparison with past nights. 
<br>
<br>What the Violence is Not 
<br>------------------------ 
<br>¶3. (C) The destruction of both public and private property 
<br>has been enormous and often self-defeating, as the youths 
<br>have targeted their own schools and gyms or their neighbors' 
<br>vehicles. But it has fallen short of full-scale riots. The 
<br>perpetrators have generally not sought out open 
<br>confrontations with state security agents, with the notable 
<br>exception of a birdshot attack November 6 that wounded 10 
<br>police and hospitalized two. Similarly, casualties have been 
<br>relatively limited. One youth lost a hand in a confrontation 
<br>with police. One bystander was killed after being punched by 
<br>a youth, and there have been a few instances of other 
<br>injuries, primarily during attacks on vehicles. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Nor has the unrest taken on the tone of an intifada, 
<br>despite the fact that a large portion of those responsible 
<br>for the violence are of Muslim background. In fact, Muslim 
<br>groups have played positive roles in trying to quell the 
<br>violence. During the first weekend of unrest, a tear gas 
<br>canister landed in a mosque, sending some 700 worshipers 
<br>fleeing. While some of the perpetrators used the incident to 
<br>justify their actions, the leadership of the mosque and many 
<br>of the worshippers there have downplayed the event in French 
<br>and international media and actively circulated among the 
<br>youth to act as mediators. The fundamentalist Union for 
<br>Islamic Organizations in France (UOIF) issued a fatwa 
<br>November 6 condemning the violence as un-Islamic. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) For the moment, the unrest is not viewed as 
<br>specifically Muslim. The French media, and French commentary 
<br>generally -- and perhaps deliberately -- identify those 
<br>involved as "minority" youth, sometimes specified as Arab 
<br>(North African) or Black (Sub-Saharan). Rarely are they 
<br>classed as "Muslim." The issue is seen as a problem of 
<br>disaffected ethnic minorities, not a local playing out of a 
<br>clash of civilizations between Muslims and the West. That 
<br>said, the GoF has alluded to the potential that radical 
<br>elements may yet seek to use the unrest to try to further 
<br>nefarious aims. Some commentators see the mediating role 
<br>being played by Islamic organizations itself as a possible 
<br>cause for concern. 
<br>
<br>The French "Way" Questioned 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>¶6. (C) The recent upheaval has raised many questions within 
<br>France about its "unitary" (as opposed to multicultural) 
<br>integration model, as well as the social inequalities and 
<br>racism that exist in French society. Although many -- 
<br>particularly on the left -- have been quick to blame the 
<br>current government, it is clear that the unrest playing out 
<br>throughout France today is the result of decades of neglect 
<br>by governments of both the left and right. The role that 
<br>France's generous social welfare system may have played in 
<br>fueling the discontent has also come under scrutiny. In many 
<br>of the areas most affected by the violence, there exist 
<br>scores of state-subsidized, long-term unemployed (Villepin 
<br>cited 57,000 in a nationally televised interview November 7) 
<br>who are provided enough money to survive, but no real 
<br>incentive to seek gainful employment. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Many of the youth are products of homes where the 
<br>primary breadwinner is among the long-term unemployed. For 
<br>other young men, there has been a breakdown in the family 
<br>structure. But the real problem is the failure of white and 
<br>Christian France to view their darker, Muslim compatriots as 
<br>real citizens. The cumulative effect has been the creation 
<br>of a generation of young males lacking parental control and 
<br>unequipped to secure and hold a job, even if they could break 
<br>through the formidable barriers of prejudice faced by young 
<br>Arabs and young blacks in particular. 
<br>
<br>Possible Political Ramifications 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>¶8. (C) Nor did the French government do a good job of 
<br>managing the situation. With an eye to the 2007 presidential 
<br>elections, Prime Minister de Villepin and Interior Minister 
<br>Sarkozy initially tried to manipulate the unrest to 
<br>individual political advantage. President Chirac was 
<br>conspicuous by his unusual silence. Only belatedly did 
<br>Villepin and Sarkozy put their differences aside and present 
<br>a common front. Villepin's decision to invoke curfew powers 
<br>has been criticized by some in the opposition as an 
<br>overreaction, but an initial poll indicates that 73 percent 
<br>of those polled agree with the hard line. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) It is impossible at this time to predict with any 
<br>precision the long-term political repercussions of the 
<br>violence, including with regard to the 2007 presidential 
<br>elections. It is also too early to know what effect, if any, 
<br>the events will have on the political activism of the 
<br>disaffected immigrant population or what steps the government 
<br>is prepared to take to give minority groups more of a 
<br>political voice. At present, the immigrant community is 
<br>vastly underrepresented in all parties and barely represented 
<br>at all in official positions, from the mayoral through 
<br>parliamentary and ministerial ranks in the French political 
<br>spectrum. 
<br>
<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br>¶10. (C) The dimensions and persistence of the unrest -- and 
<br>the depth of the frustration reflected by it -- largely 
<br>blindsided France's political class, which is generally 
<br>regarded as being far-removed from the lives and experiences 
<br>of ordinary people. That said, the government response -- to 
<br>focus on re-establishing order while scrupulously avoiding 
<br>excessive police violence, and to promise effective 
<br>engagement to better social conditions -- appears initially 
<br>to be working. The nightly violence is decreasing, both as 
<br>police enforce newly authorized curfews in selected areas and 
<br>as local government and citizens mobilize to defend their 
<br>communities. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) While this approach may prove successful in quelling 
<br>the current wave of unrest, sporadic incidents of car 
<br>burnings and clashes with police are likely to persist. The 
<br>youths perpetrating the violence and vandalism -- and the 
<br>criminal groups that in some cases are manipulating them -- 
<br>are present in every poor suburb, and no amount of policing 
<br>will preventively keep them completely in check. While 
<br>responsible leaders across the political spectrum agree that 
<br>France must do more to integrate its more recent immigrants, 
<br>agreeing is not the same as doing. The recent wave of unrest 
<br>has publicly and embarrassingly exposed France's deep social 
<br>inequalities, reminding the broader public of the persistence 
<br>of France's large, probably growing underclass (estimated at 
<br>4.7 million by Social Affairs Minister Borloo). 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Once calm returns, the GoF will be expected to 
<br>follow through on promised reforms to address the underlying 
<br>issues that have fueled the unrest. But unless there is some 
<br>measurable amelioration of the structural unemployment, 
<br>societal discrimination, and widening gulf between mainstream 
<br>French society and the people of the suburban projects, the 
<br>nightly violence will continue to simmer just below the 
<br>surface and will recurrently boil over. The challenge is 
<br>enormous for the government, given France's slow economic 
<br>growth and chronic unemployment. Any job creation program is 
<br>likely to focus on inefficient public-sector programs that do 
<br>nothing to empower the private sector and provide incentives 
<br>to the unemployed. It will also be a challenge to change 
<br>deeply ingrained negative attitudes towards non-white 
<br>immigrants. However, not to make the effort would squander a 
<br>crucial opportunity to significantly enhance the well-being 
<br>and prospects of a disaffected Muslim underclass before it 
<br>becomes politically radicalized. End Comment.
