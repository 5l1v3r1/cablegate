<br>Summary

<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Although the Morales government states it wants good 
<br>relations with the United States, officials often use 
<br>anti-U.S. rhetoric to distract from domestic problems, as 
<br>when the Bolivian government recently groundlessly accused 
<br>the United States of financing opposition groups. The key 
<br>areas of concern in Bolivia currently are democracy, 
<br>narcotics, and protection for U.S. investments. While Garcia 
<br>Linera is generally seen as one of the more reasonable 
<br>members of the Bolivian government, and often acts as 
<br>moderator for radical elements of the ruling Movement Toward 
<br>Socialism (MAS) party, he has been aggressive in questioning 
<br>the role and purpose of U.S. aid and U.S. anti-narcotics 
<br>policies. The VP will likely push for ATPDEA extension and 
<br>seek Millennium Challenge Account funding. End summary.

<br>
<br>¶2. (C) It has become the norm for the Morales government to 
<br>launch verbal attacks against "American imperialism" in times 
<br>of domestic difficulties in order to deflect public 
<br>attention. On multiple occasions, President Morales has also 
<br>accused the U.S. government of attempted "terrorism", 
<br>suggesting that an Amcit who bombed a Bolivian hostel in 2006 
<br>was acting on USG orders. President Morales cited this 
<br>supposed act of terrorism as an excuse for proposing visa 
<br>requirements for U.S. visitors, expected to enter into force 
<br>in December. Concerned about a recent increase in vitriolic 
<br>rhetoric, Ambassador Goldberg reviewed the U.S.- Bolivia 
<br>bilateral relationship with Vice President Garcia Linera 
<br>August 20 and noted recent pronouncements and actions on the 
<br>part of the Bolivian government that strain bilateral ties. 
<br>The Vice President promised to look into the issues of 
<br>concern and asked that the Ambassador not allow the forces 
<br>that seek to distance Bolivia from the U.S. to prevail, 
<br>emphasizing that the Bolivian government is committed to 
<br>improving relations (ref b). However, not even a week later, 
<br>Garcia Linera came out publicly accusing the U.S. government 
<br>of funding opposition groups in Bolivia. We called on Vice 
<br>Minister of Foreign Affairs Hugo Fernandez on August 28 to 
<br>protest these baseless accusations. Despite our protest, the 
<br>Bolivian government a day later (August 29) stepped up their 
<br>anti-U.S. aid rhetoric. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) With no warning, Minister of the Presidency Quintana 
<br>gave a lengthy presentation on state-run television accusing 
<br>USAID of supporting the opposition and providing what he 
<br>described as evidence in support of Morales's and Garcia 
<br>Linera's previous accusations. Using USAID's democracy 
<br>program as an example, Quintana claimed that only 30 percent 
<br>of the funding could be accounted for and said that the other 
<br>70 percent is programmed unilaterally. Quintana listed 
<br>grants and subcontracts which have been given to Bolivian 
<br>organizations, highlighting organization managers who worked 
<br>in previous governments as an example of the USG funding 
<br>supporters of the "old way" and those against the MAS program 
<br>of change. Quintana praised foreign aid from other 
<br>countries, stating that other countries follow Bolivian laws. 
<br>In a particularly ugly insinuation, Quintana called on 
<br>USAID's Bolivian employees to "remain loyal" and "not be 
<br>traitors." We would find it useful if the Deputy Secretary 
<br>could repeat to Garcia Linera our concerns about the 
<br>potential damage to the bilateral relationship if such 
<br>baseless anti-U.S. attacks persist.

<br>Democracy in Danger

<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Strengthening and supporting democracy in Bolivia is 
<br>our mission's primary concern. Although the ruling MAS party 
<br>and President Evo Morales were elected with a clear majority 
<br>in fair and open elections, their actions since assuming 
<br>power have often displayed anti-democratic tendencies. 
<br>President Morales is currently attempting to discredit and 
<br>weaken the judicial branch of government. Specifically, the 
<br>MAS-controlled lower house of Congress has sent an 
<br>impeachment case against four of the five judges of the 
<br>Constitutional Tribunal (the court which considers questions 
<br>of constitutionality, separate from the Supreme Court, which 
<br>is the court of final appeal.) The vote on the impeachment 
<br>case was a striking example of how the MAS has begun to 
<br>manipulate regulations in order to push the MAS agenda: after 
<br>fighting broke out in the Congress, the MAS head of the lower 
<br>house convened only the MAS congressmen in the offices of the 
<br>Vice President, where they voted by "majority of those 
<br>present" (that is, only the MAS) to impeach the four judges. 
<br>The MAS's aggressive actions in the Constituent Assembly, 
<br>which is currently attempting to draft Bolivia's new 
<br>constitution, also provide an example of the MAS's growing 
<br>disregard for the democratic process. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) During a recent visit by Venezuelan President Hugo 
<br>Chavez, President Evo Morales went so far as to declare his 
<br>intention to rule by decree if laws got in his way. In a 
<br>number of areas, Evo seems to be following in Chavez's 
<br>footsteps (for example, the recently-published draft 
<br>constitution, written by the MAS and Evo's Spanish and 
<br>Venezuelan advisors, would allow indefinite reelection for 
<br>the President and Vice President.) Venezuelan funding is 
<br>pouring into the country with no transparency or 
<br>accountability, further damaging the democratic process. In 
<br>fact, La Razon (Bolivia's paper-of-record), recently called 
<br>into question Venezuelan assistance.

<br>Narcotics: Room for Further Cooperation? 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Counter-narcotics programs represent a chance for the 
<br>Bolivian and U.S. governments to work together, but again 
<br>Bolivian government rhetoric has made the task more 
<br>difficult. President Evo Morales, who is the head of 
<br>Bolivia's 'cocalero' coca-growing union, is a staunch 
<br>supporter of coca leaf cultivation, and he publicly 
<br>emphasizes a distinction between coca leaf and cocaine. In 
<br>reality, the line between the two is far from clear: 
<br>interdiction has increased under Evo's tenure, but so have 
<br>coca production and cocaine exports. The Bolivian 
<br>government's policies regarding coca are often incoherent, 
<br>with one ministry challenging or annulling the actions of 
<br>another ministry. Ambassador Goldberg was called to a 
<br>meeting with Vice Foreign Minister Hugo Fernandez on August 
<br>22 to discuss his public comments voicing U.S. concerns over 
<br>the rise of coca cultivation and drug trafficking. The 
<br>Ambassador explained that his comments reflected concerns 
<br>shared by Bolivian and U.S. drug enforcement authorities, 
<br>supported by the latest United Nations figures. Evo's 
<br>administration's reaction to the Ambassador's statements 
<br>suggests that the comments struck a raw nerve. Evo is having 
<br>difficulties making the case that coca cultivation is 
<br>separate from cocaine production and does not want to be seen 
<br>as tolerating an increase in drug trafficking. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) The Bolivian government, however, may be starting to 
<br>realize that drugs represent a growing problem domestically 
<br>and therefore may become more open to greater 
<br>counternarcotics cooperation with the United States. 
<br>Following a persistent effort by the Ambassador to push for a 
<br>net reduction in coca cultivation, the Bolivian government 
<br>announced August 28 that it is working on an "Action Plan" to 
<br>implement the government's strategy to reduce coca 
<br>cultivation to 20,000 hectares, down from the estimated 
<br>27,500 hectares currently being cultivated (according to 
<br>UNODC's 2006 estimate). The government has plans to go even 
<br>further and bring down coca cultivation to 16,000 hectares 
<br>(by an unspecified date). While we reject the government's 
<br>ongoing effort to bring "legal' cultivation to 20,000 
<br>hectares and would clearly want the government to produce a 
<br>more substantial net reduction, 20,000 hectares would 
<br>represent the average of what has been grown annually in 
<br>Bolivia over the past decade, including during the past 
<br>administrations. There may be an opportunity here for us to 
<br>start a process which will achieve net reduction. The Vice 
<br>President has discussed with the Ambassador the possibility 
<br>of working out a bilateral agreement to achieve net coca 
<br>reduction; it would be useful if the Deputy Secretary could 
<br>refer to this idea and urge Garcia Linera to follow-up.

<br>U.S. Investments Threatened 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) The MAS's draft constitution made public on August 14 
<br>includes an article that specifies that international 
<br>investors would only enjoy the benefits of Bolivian law and 
<br>could not invoke external agreements or, by implication, 
<br>international arbitration. A number of Evo's recent actions 
<br>and statements have been seen as anti-investment by the 
<br>industries affected: to give only a few examples, the forced 
<br>renegotiation of petroleum contracts, the nationalization of 
<br>Glencore's Vinto smelter, Evo's stated intention to create a 
<br>state energy and electricity company, the Bolivian 
<br>government's desire to repatriate a controlling share in 
<br>Entel the Italian-owned telephone company, and Morales's 
<br>claims that the Bolivian government now controls twenty 
<br>percent of Bolivia's economy and should be involved in more. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) One U.S. investment which is vulnerable is San 
<br>Cristobal mine, which is 65 percent owned by Apex Silver. 
<br>San Cristobal would be particularly hard-hit by a bill 
<br>currently in Congress, which would increase mining taxes. 
<br>Although the Bolivian government claims to want a fifty-fifty 
<br>split of profits, the proposed tax increases actually result 
<br>in, on average, a 60 percent government take of profits. 
<br>Because Apex hedged on metal prices in order to obtain 
<br>financing, in aggregate proposed tax increases pose a serious 
<br>threat to San Cristobal mine. When hedge costs are factored 
<br>in to the overall cost structure, Apex estimates that the 
<br>proposed tax regime will yield the GOB a 93 percent effective 
<br>tax rate. If refunds on import taxes are eliminated for 
<br>mines that produce concentrate instead of metal, as has been 
<br>proposed by the Ministry of Finance, the government's take 
<br>would be more than 100 percent of San Cristobal's profits. 
<br>In his August 20 meeting with Vice President Garcia Linera, 
<br>the Ambassador noted that given the USD 900 million 
<br>investment in San Cristobal mine, he hoped that the Vice 
<br>President would grant Apex Silver the opportunity to present 
<br>its concerns about the government's planned tax increase 
<br>directly to him. Vice President Garcia Linera agreed to look 
<br>into the matter and promised to hear out Apex Silver's 
<br>concerns once he had a potential way forward.

<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Vice President Linera will likely push for extension 
<br>of ATPDEA during your meeting. ATPDEA is crucial to a 
<br>certain segment of the Bolivian economy, particularly 
<br>specialty textile goods (note: USAID has provided support to 
<br>a number of small companies which, without ATPDEA, would 
<br>likely go bankrupt.) President Morales has made numerous 
<br>statements that ATPDEA should not be extended by increments 
<br>but should be formalized to give Bolivia permanent beneficial 
<br>trade access to the United States. Morales has also stated 
<br>that ATPDEA is not a U.S. "handout" but instead is Bolivia's 
<br>due for its help in counternarcotics efforts. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Vice President Garcia Linera is likely to push for 
<br>extension of ATPDEA or mention a potential long-term 
<br>bilateral "trade agreement" that Bolivian officials have yet 
<br>to define. We also understand that Garcia Linera will visit 
<br>with the Millennium Challenge Corporation to try to 
<br>accelerate efforts to negotiate a compact.

<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Ambassador Goldberg has made clear our desire for 
<br>good relations with Bolivia. In return, Vice President 
<br>Garcia Linera has stressed that the Bolivian government also 
<br>wants better relations with the United States and has pleaded 
<br>with us not to "surrender to the forces that want to distance 
<br>our countries" and to continue to work to try to find areas 
<br>of cooperation but has done little to tone down his 
<br>president's or even his own anti-U.S. rhetoric. 
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Garcia Linera needs to hear our concerns about 
<br>Bolivian democracy, the eroding investment climate, as well 
<br>as our desire to continue and even expand counter-drug 
<br>efforts. We also have to continue to urge the Morales 
<br>government to temper its rhetoric if it is indeed interested 
<br>in improved bilateral ties. That said, we are not optimistic 
<br>that the United States will be able to improve its 
<br>relationship with Bolivia in the short term, given Morales's 
<br>paranoia and Chavez's continuing influence here.
