<br>
<br>Summary
<br>
<br>-------------
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Argentine Finance Secretary Hernan Lorenzino expects the
<br>GoA's proposed debt swap agreement to be fully approved by
<br>international regulatory authorities and ready for launch by
<br>mid-March. Noting the recent negative market environment, he said
<br>that the exchange might have to go forward without the new money
<br>component that was earlier thought to be a key part of the proposal
<br>- the USD 1 billion that was to be raised from institutional
<br>investors as part of the deal. Lorenzino dismissed the attempt by
<br>the political opposition to tie Barclays, the lead bank working on
<br>the debt swap, to the British oil rig exploring for oil off the
<br>coast of the Falkland/Malvinas Islands. He said Barclays was not
<br>associated with the rig's owner and that its position working on
<br>the holdout proposal is secure. Regarding the Paris Club debt,
<br>Lorenzino said that the GoA would focus its attention on the issue
<br>after the holdout debt restructuring is completed; separately,
<br>however, he is telling at least one European Embassy that the GoA
<br>is unwilling to submit to an IMF Article IV consultation. He also
<br>discussed the imminent transfer of ARP 24 billion in 2009 Central
<br>Bank (BCRA) profits to the Treasury, calling it "business as
<br>usual." Finally, with regard to the Azurix ICSID negotiations,
<br>Lorenzino said that the case was moving forward and that new
<br>Treasury Attorney Da Rocha would be meeting with the Chief of
<br>Cabinet or President in the next few days to discuss it. End
<br>Summary.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>SEC Still Asking Questions
<br>
<br>------------------------------------
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Secretary of Finance Hernan Lorenzino told EconCouns on
<br>February 22 that the GoA is waiting for U.S. Security and Exchange
<br>Commission (SEC) approval to be able to move ahead with the
<br>proposed debt restructuring. He explained that the disruption
<br>caused by the snow storms in the U.S. had somewhat delayed the
<br>SEC's review process. The GoA expects to receive a new round of
<br>SEC questions and requests for clarifications imminently.
<br>Lorenzino said that he will not be able to estimate with any
<br>confidence when the holdout transaction would be ready to launch
<br>until he sees the number and complexity of these questions.
<br>Following authorization by the SEC, the regulatory agencies of
<br>Luxembourg, Italy and Japan will also examine the proposal. He
<br>noted that Luxembourg has already begun reviewing the documentation
<br>and sent several questions which the GoA expected to answer within
<br>the next few days. The Italian regulatory agency (Consob) has also
<br>begun an informal review of the filing. (The Italian Ambassador to
<br>Argentine Guido La Tella told the Ambassador February 18 that he
<br>had also met recently with Lorenzino and was given the same upbeat
<br>presentation on the deal's prospects.) Despite continuing
<br>uncertainty about the status of the SEC review, Lorenzino expressed
<br>the hope that all of the international regulatory agencies involved
<br>would complete their review processes within the next two to three
<br>weeks, and that the GoA would be able to launch the swap in
<br>mid-March.
<br>
<br>
<br>New Money Component May Be Dropped
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---------
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Lorenzino acknowledged that while the present market
<br>environment is becoming somewhat less positive, this does not
<br>overly concern him. The GoA's top priority is to secure all the
<br>necessary regulatory approvals to get the transaction ready for a
<br>global launch. However, he did indicate, for the first time, that
<br>the more negative market environment might require the exchange to
<br>go forward as a stand-alone transaction, without a new money
<br>component. (Conventional wisdom up to now has been that in order
<br>to support the proposals, the Kirchners had demanded that at least
<br>USD 1 billion in new money be raised from institutional investors
<br>as an integral part of the debt swap.)
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Barclays Position as Lead Bank Secure
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) EconCouns asked whether the position of Barclays Bank as
<br>the lead bank working for the GoA in the development of the holdout
<br>proposal was endangered by opposition accusations that the bank
<br>held a significant position in the British-owned company Desire
<br>Petroleum, which is leading the controversial effort to explore
<br>for oil and natural gas in the waters off of the Falkland/Malvinas
<br>Islands. Lorenzino responded that Barclays position was secure.
<br>He said that the company does not own any part of Desire Petroleum.
<br>Rather, Barclays owns a fund that manages third-party funds which
<br>are invested in that company. He emphasized that the Barclay's
<br>business unit hired to work on the debt exchange has no connection
<br>whatsoever to anything related to the Falklands/Malvinas and would
<br>continue in its present role with regard to the holdout proposal.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Paris Club After Holdouts
<br>
<br>---------------------------------
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Lorenzino said that while full attention is now focused on
<br>the debt exchange, the GoA has the will to move forward to solve
<br>the problem of the debt owed to the Paris Club creditors. He
<br>explained that his people have been working on a strategic plan --
<br>which has been presented to the Minister of Economy -- to make
<br>progress on this issue after the completion of the debt
<br>restructuring. He added that discussions have progressed to the
<br>point where the government has met with various financial experts
<br>who may potentially advise it regarding how to proceed with the
<br>issue. (Italian Ambassador La Tella told the Ambassador that
<br>Lorenzino described the GoA's Paris Club game-plan in greater
<br>detail in a recent conversation, and that it is, to put it mildly,
<br>unorthodox. In lieu of an IMF Article IV consultation, the GoA
<br>will propose that the Paris Club accept a "peer review" of
<br>Argentina's economy in the G20, in which Argentina is a member, or
<br>in the OECD, in which it is not.)
<br>
<br>
<br>2009 BCRA Profits to Treasury
<br>
<br>-----------------------------------------
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Lorenzino confirmed press articles which said that about
<br>ARP 24 billion in 2009 BCRA profits would be transferred to the
<br>Treasury. He said that this has been standard practice for the
<br>last couple of years. He compared it to a dividend payout received
<br>by stockholders in private companies, explaining that the profit on
<br>the BCRA's assets came mainly from the peso devaluation and the
<br>interest on bonds in the BCRA's portfolio. The transfer will take
<br>place after the BCRA's Board of Directors approves the transaction.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Azurix ICSID Case
<br>
<br>-------------------------
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Lorenzino explained that the Treasury Attorney's office
<br>(Procuracion General del Tesoro) has the lead on the Azurix ICSID
<br>case negotiations and that the Ministry of Economy's role is
<br>secondary. He mentioned that he recently participated in two
<br>meetings related to Azurix with the new Treasury Attorney Joaquin
<br>Da Rocha, in one of which Economy Minister Boudou participated. In
<br>those meetings, they discussed the general budgetary impact of
<br>ICISD cases, including Azurix, CMS, and two similar cases which had
<br>been decided in favor of the companies involved and awards were
<br>granted. Regarding the Azurix case specifically, they discussed
<br>how to deal with the complication of the involvement of the
<br>Province of Buenos Aires in the case and how that would affect the
<br>flow of money from the Treasury to the company. Despite that,
<br>Lorenzino said that he was not aware of any problems that would
<br>delay an agreement, saying that the case is moving forward, and
<br>that Da Rocha will meet in the next few days with the Chief of
<br>Cabinet and/or the President on the issue.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Comment
<br>
<br>--------------
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Lorenzino still seems to have the full support of the
<br>government to carry the debt restructuring through to a conclusion.
<br>In fact, the government seems so intent on pushing the process
<br>forward that it appears to be displaying unprecedented flexibility
<br>in the terms it is willing to accept, i.e. the potential dropping
<br>of the new money component. However, the one thing that could
<br>still derail the agreement is the possibility that Minister of
<br>Economy Boudou might be fired. Over the last few days, there have
<br>been press reports to the effect that Boudou is on his way out due
<br>to the problems caused to the government by his handling of the
<br>BCRA leadership imbroglio and the controversial Bicentennial Fund.
<br>Embassy sources discount these rumors at this point, and say that
<br>he is likely to stay on at least until the debt swap is completed.
<br>(And Boudou got a new public vote of confidence from Cabinet Chief
<br>Fernandez on February 24.) Given that he has been the champion
<br>within the government of a solution to the holdout problem, his
<br>continued presence is crucial. If he goes now, it is unlikely that
<br>
<br>
<br>the restructuring agreement will be completed anytime soon.
