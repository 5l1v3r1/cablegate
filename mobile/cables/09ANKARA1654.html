<br> 
<br>REF: ANKARA 1626 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Ambassador James Jeffrey, for reasons 1.4(b,d) 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (S) Iran dominated A/S Gordon's 40-minute meeting November 
<br>12 with Foreign Minister Davutoglu.  The FM had just gotten 
<br>off the phone with El-Baradei and had discussed in detail the 
<br>IAEA proposal to send Iran's low enriched uranium to Turkey. 
<br>El-Baradei had said he would "call Washington" that same 
<br>morning.  This had followed two long "harsh" sessions with 
<br>the Iranians in Istanbul on Sunday evening.  The Iranians 
<br>have said they are willing to meet with Solana, but have told 
<br>the Turks that they have serious problems with Cooper and the 
<br>British.  They have "more trust" in the U.S.  The Iranians 
<br>would also prefer to get fuel from the U.S. rather than the 
<br>Russians. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S) Davutoglu said the Iranians:  a) are ready to send a 
<br>delegation to Vienna to work out the specifics on this 
<br>proposal; b) have given their "full trust" to Turkey; c) 
<br>continue to face serious domestic problems inside Iran.  He 
<br>said the Turks actually see Ahmadinejad as "more flexible" 
<br>than others who are inside the Iranian Government. 
<br>Ahmadinejad is facing "huge pressure" after statements from 
<br>some P5 members to the effect that a nuclear deal would 
<br>succeed in weakening Iran,s nuclear capability -- which is 
<br>interpreted by some circles in Iran as a virtual defeat. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S) Given this context, the Turks had asked Ahmadinejad if 
<br>the core of the issue is psychological rather than substance. 
<br> Ahmadinejad had said "yes," that the Iranians agree to the 
<br>proposal but need to manage the public perception. 
<br>Accordingly, the Iranians are proposing that the first 400 
<br>kilos be transferred to Kish Island -- thereby keeping it on 
<br>Iranian soil -- and would receive right away an equivalent 
<br>amount (30-50 kilos) of enriched fuel.  The second stage 
<br>would focus on the management of Iranian public opinion, 
<br>after which Tehran would proceed with the Turkey option for 
<br>the remaining 800 kilos, probably in two tranches.  Davutoglu 
<br>said Baradei agreed to consider this. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (S) Davutoglu noted that he had spoken to NSA General 
<br>Jones Wednesday, who had said that we should perhaps suggest 
<br>to the Iranians that they transfer 600 kilos to Kish Island 
<br>and 600 kilos to Turkey simultaneously.  A/S Gordon said he 
<br>could not give an official response to the proposal as this 
<br>is the first time we heard it, but that he anticipates much 
<br>skepticism about providing fuel to Iran before all the LEU 
<br>has been taken out.  It would be better to get all 1200 kilos 
<br>out right away. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) Davutoglu noted that these are two different 
<br>proposals.  The first is Iran's request for fuel for its 
<br>nuclear reactor.  Even if this takes place, he said, we still 
<br>need to work on limiting Iran's nuclear enrichment 
<br>capability.  If we succeed with this proposal, he said, it 
<br>will create "confidence" and a "new momentum" and would allow 
<br>room for negotiation. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) Noting that Davutoglu had only addressed the negative 
<br>consequences of sanctions or the use of military force, 
<br>Gordon pressed Davutoglu on Ankara's assessment of the 
<br>consequences if Iran gets a nuclear weapon.  Davutoglu gave a 
<br>spirited reply, that "of course" Turkey was aware of this 
<br>risk.  This is precisely why Turkey is working so hard with 
<br>the Iranians.  President Gul himself had spent two hours 
<br>Sunday with Ahmadinejad in Istanbul. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) Gordon noted that while we acknowledge that Turkey can 
<br>be helpful as a mediator, some of the Prime Minister's recent 
<br>public comments raise questions about how Turkey sees this 
<br>issue.  Davutoglu said he is aware of these concerns, but 
<br>contended that the Guardian newspaper had not accurately 
<br>presented its recent interview with the Prime Minister.   The 
<br>PM's comments had been taken out of context.  Erdogan had 
<br>been asked if he views Iran as a friend.  If he had said 
<br>"no," it would not have been possible to convince Tehran to 
<br>cooperate on this latest proposal.  Only Turkey can speak 
<br>bluntly and critically to the Iranians, Davutoglu contended, 
<br>but only because Ankara is showing public messages of 
<br>friendship. 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (C) Gordon pushed back that Ankara should give a stern 
<br>public message about the consequences if UN resolutions are 
<br>ignored.  Davutoglu countered that Erdogan had given just 
<br>such a statement in Tehran when he visited.  He emphasized 
<br>that Turkey's foreign policy is giving a "sense of justice" 
<br>and a "sense of vision" to the region.  Turkey has provided a 
<br>"third option" in addition to Iran and the Saudis (who he 
<br>contended are viewed as "puppets" of the US).  The result, he 
<br>said, is that we "limit Iranian influence in the region."  We 
<br> 
<br>ANKARA 00001654  002 OF 002 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>need a "pro-Western approach AND a sense of justice." 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C) A/S Gordon has cleared this cable.
