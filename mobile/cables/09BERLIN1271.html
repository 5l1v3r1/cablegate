<br> 
<br>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor George Glass for reasons 1. 
<br>4 (b,d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (C//NF) Summary: A well-placed FDP source said that on 
<br>the first day of coalition negotiations (October 5) between 
<br>the CDU, CSU and the FDP, FDP leader Westerwelle argued for 
<br>the removal of the remaining non-strategic nuclear weapons 
<br>from German soil.  Interior Minister Schaeuble (CDU) asserted 
<br>that the weapons serve as a deterrent.  Other foreign policy 
<br>issues discussed included support for Afghanistan and 
<br>Turkey's accession to the EU.  Source said that Chancellor 
<br>Merkel (CDU) may push to complete the negotiations by October 
<br>18, but noted that the FDP is in no hurry.  He provided 
<br>Emboffs with a list of the membership of the negotiations 
<br>plenary and working groups as well as timetable.  Cabinet 
<br>composition will only be decided at the end of coalition 
<br>negotiations.  End summary. 
<br> 
<br>Westerwelle Firm on Removal of Nuclear Weapons 
<br>--------------------------------------------- - 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (C//NF) Formal coalition negotiations between Guido 
<br>Westerwelle's Free Democratic Party (FDP), Chancellor 
<br>Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Christian 
<br>Social Union (CSU) on a coalition agreement began on October 
<br>¶5.  FDP strategist shared with Emboffs and visiting Senior 
<br>Germany Desk Officer October 7 information on issues 
<br>discussed during the first two days of these negotiations as 
<br>well as the negotiations schedule and working group make-up. 
<br>Source serves as his party's notetaker for the negotiations 
<br>and has been a long-standing close Embassy contact. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C//NF) Source said that on October 5 negotiations 
<br>included discussion on arms control in general and removal of 
<br>the remaining non-strategic nuclear weapons from German soil. 
<br> He said that Federal Interior Minister Schaeuble argued that 
<br>the weapons serve as a deterrent to Iran.  (Note: Regarding 
<br>Schaeuble, source commented that he is "neurotic" in that he 
<br>sees threats everywhere.  He questioned whether Schaeuble's 
<br>influence is as great as it once was and whether he will stay 
<br>in his position.  End note.)  According to source, 
<br>Westerwelle asserted that nuclear weapons on German soil do 
<br>not serve as a deterrent against Iran since they could not 
<br>reach Iran.  He said that Westerwelle underlined that 
<br>President Obama is moving forward toward a "nuclear-free 
<br>world" and that he wants Germany to be in the lead.  Source 
<br>said that Chancellor Merkel quipped in response that Germany 
<br>is not that important in this regard -- the world would 
<br>hardly take notice if there were action on this matter. 
<br>According to source, Merkel wanted to avoid discussion of 
<br>this topic.  Source also said that there was criticism of 
<br>Social Democratic Party Foreign Minister Steinmeier that he 
<br>did not respond adequately to President Obama's Prague speech 
<br>in which he discussed arms control.  In response to Poloff 
<br>query, source said that the issue of removal of nuclear 
<br>weapons is very important to Westerwelle and that he could 
<br>well seek to include something specific in the coalition 
<br>agreement. 
<br> 
<br>Turkey's EU Membership; Afghanistan; Transatlantic Relations 
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (C//NF) Source said that Turkey's accession to the EU was 
<br>also discussed, with general agreement that Turkey is not 
<br>ready for membership and could not fulfill membership 
<br>criteria.  Source said that there was agreement that no 
<br>decision would have to be reached on this issue within the 
<br>next four years in any case.  Westerwelle also spoke against 
<br>any type of automatic decision in favor of membership for 
<br>Turkey.  There was also general agreement that the EU is not 
<br>ready for new members at this time beyond Croatia. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (C//NF) Afghanistan was also an issue, but source only 
<br>noted that there was general agreement on the need to 
<br>continue efforts in Afghanistan.  Source also stressed that 
<br>the three parties support strong transatlantic relations and 
<br>continuity in foreign policy. 
<br> 
<br>The Devil's in the Details; What's the Rush? 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (C//NF) Source assessed some differences in Merkel's and 
<br>Westerwelle's approach to the negotiations, although he also 
<br>noted that the atmosphere was "very friendly and relaxed." 
<br>He observed that Merkel preferred less detail and more 
<br>general provisions, whereas Westerwelle was interested in a 
<br> 
<br>detailed agreement that would guide the coalition over the 
<br>next four years.  In addition, source noted that Merkel is 
<br>trying to push the negotiations along since she would like to 
<br>have the new government in place before she travels to 
<br>Washington in early November and before the EU summit at the 
<br>end of October.  Source indicated that Westerwelle might try 
<br>to use Merkel's desire for speed to his advantage in the 
<br>negotiations.  While he did not indicate that the FDP would 
<br>prolong negotiations intentionally, he noted that the FDP was 
<br>in no hurry to complete them. 
<br> 
<br>Ministries Divided Among Parties Last 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C//NF)  Regarding the possible make-up of the cabinet, 
<br>source said that no decisions will be made until the end of 
<br>coalition negotiations and that the current membership of 
<br>working groups should not be seen as an indication of who 
<br>will end up in which ministry (see ref B).  Source also said 
<br>that the coalition agreement may only say which ministerial 
<br>posts go to which coalition parties, without any names being 
<br>given.  The names would only be provided later, perhaps after 
<br>the Chancellor is voted in by the Bundestag.  Source noted 
<br>that only two positions are certain: Angela Merkel will be 
<br>Chancellor and Guido Westerwelle will be Vice Chancellor.  He 
<br>added that Westerwelle will most likely also become the next 
<br>foreign minister.  He then commented that during October 5 
<br>negotiations, Economics Minister zu Guttenberg demonstrated 
<br>his interest in foreign policy and Hermann Otto Solms (FDP) 
<br>showed he could play an increasingly important role in the 
<br>financial area.  Source provided Emboffs with the names of 
<br>those serving in the plenary rounds of the negotiations and a 
<br>schedule of when those rounds will take place. 
<br>

<br>Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, Chancellery Chief Thomas de 
<br>Maziere, Education Minister Annette Shavan, CDU/CSU Caucus

<br>President of Lower Saxony Christian Wulff.

<br> 
<br> 
<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (C//NF) Westerwelle has made the removal of nuclear 
<br>weapons from Germany one of his flagship issues in the 
<br>foreign policy arena and has raised this in various fora in 
<br>the past.  It is not clear how hard he will push to have a 
<br>specific provision on this included in the coalition 
<br>agreement.  Judging by source's description of the 
<br>discussion, Merkel would rather have a more general provision 
<br>regarding disarmament included and preferred to avoid 
<br>prolonged discussion on this issue. 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (C//NF) The CDU/CSU is the only party that still supports 
<br>German participation in the NATO nuclear share and the 
<br>deployment of U.S. nuclear weapons in Germany.  While the 
<br>CDU/CSU leadership is willing to fight for the current 
<br>policy, it is concerned that the ongoing Nuclear Posture 
<br>Review could significantly change U.S. policy on the 
<br>deployment of non-strategic nuclear weapons in Europe, 
<br>putting it at a significant political disadvantage vis-a-vis 
<br>the rest of the German political establishment.  In fact, 
<br>senior Chancellery officials have already requested that they 
<br>be pre-notified about any possible change in U.S. policy (ref 
<br>C).  We expect that in these coalition negotiations, the 
<br>CDU/CSU may hedge their bets against a possible U.S. policy 
<br>change by agreeing to language that commits the next 
<br>government to seek consultations on this issue at NATO, with 
<br>the caveat that any decision must be made by the Alliance as 
<br> 
<br>a whole and must take account of the large number of Russian 
<br>non-strategic nuclear weapons oriented against NATO member 
<br>states.  Post will seek meetings with source after the 
<br>plenary negotiation rounds to see if additional readouts are 
<br>possible. 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (C//NF) FDP source is a young, up-and-coming party 
<br>loyalist, who has offered Emboffs internal party documents in 
<br>the past.  Excited with his role as FDP negotiations 
<br>notetaker, he seemed happy to share his observations and 
<br>insights and read to us directly from his notes.  He also 
<br>provided copies of documents from his "negotiations" binder.
