<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY. At the same time that National Security 
<br>Advisor Jones highlighted the importance of U.S.-Brazil 
<br>partnership (reported septel), Under Secretary of State for 
<br>International Security and Arms Control Ellen Tauscher and 
<br>Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and 
<br>Logistics Ashton Carter held extensive meetings August 4-6 
<br>with Brazilian leadership, including the ministers of Defense 
<br>and External Relations, the President's Foreign Policy 
<br>Advisor, and the Air Force commander, in support of the U.S. 
<br>bid to provide Brazil,s next generation fighter aircraft. 
<br>U/S Tauscher provided a letter from Secretary Clinton to her 
<br>Brazilian counterparts assuring them of State Department 
<br>support. As noted in ref a and other cables, Brazil has long 
<br>been concerned about U.S. willingness to transfer technology. 
<br>The visit of the two USG officials responsible for technology 
<br>release came at an opportune time as the GOB prepares for a 
<br>final decision. As a result, Brazilian Air Force Chief Saito 
<br>announced that the decision would be delayed into 
<br>mid-September, a key date as French President Sarkozy plans 
<br>to visit Brazil September 7, when conventional wisdom 
<br>expected a decision in favor of the French aircraft as a 
<br>deliverable. While the Under Secretaries, visit has 
<br>increased momentum in favor of the Boeing Super Hornet, there 
<br>is still considerable political support for the French, and a 
<br>major lobbying effort associated with the Sarkozy visit is 
<br>expected. Getting the F18 across the finish line will 
<br>require continued USG efforts. Post recommends additional 
<br>high level approaches to key Brazilian decision makers -- 
<br>including President Lula -- and preparing a public affairs 
<br>strategy to counter possible misinformation as the decision 
<br>approaches. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) According to Brazilian contacts, the July 9 
<br>discussion between Presidents Obama and Lula on Brazil,s 
<br>fighter purchase energized the U.S. bid. While Brazil had 
<br>previously been skeptical about U.S. support for transfer of 
<br>technology, the President,s assurance opened the door for 
<br>the USG to make its case. While NSA Jones provided much of 
<br>the big picture vision of a U.S.-Brazil partnership, Under 
<br>Secretaries Tauscher and Carter took on the task of making 
<br>the case for Boeing,s bid. U/S Tauscher,s role was vital 
<br>as it was the first time that Brazilian officials who will be 
<br>making the decision of which plane to buy heard from a senior 
<br>State Department official that the USG had approved the 
<br>necessary transfer of technology (see ref b for discussion of 
<br>Brazil doubts about State). 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) In their meetings with Brazilian leaders, Tauscher 
<br>and Carter,s message was consistent: the U.S. is interested 
<br>in a partnership with Brazil. The fighter sale is only one 
<br>aspect of this, although greater interoperability resulting 
<br>from the use of U.S. fighters will advance cooperation. 
<br>Tauscher made the point that the United States prizes its 
<br>relationship with Brazil, as evidenced by the unprecedented 
<br>nature of some of the decisions in relation to the Super 
<br>Hornet, in particular the authorization to integrate 
<br>Brazilian manufactured weapons. As the official ultimately 
<br>responsible for export controls, Tauscher said that future 
<br>decisions regarding Brazil would receive careful 
<br>consideration in terms of how to help a friendly government. 
<br>Regarding the U.S. decision to deny retransfer of USML 
<br>controlled parts of Brazilian Super Tucano aircraft to 
<br>Venezuela, she pointed out that the decision had been made by 
<br>the previous administration to deny aircraft to Venezuela, 
<br>but without consideration of its effect on Brazil. She 
<br>stated that future decisions regarding Brazil would take 
<br>Brazil,s interests more into account and would include 
<br>consultations with the GOB as appropriate. Tauscher noted 
<br>that national security and economic security are inseparable 
<br>and a deal between Boeing and Brazil would not only improve 
<br>Brazil,s security but would entail important economic 
<br>benefits. The Super Hornet, she said, is the best multi-role 
<br>fighter in the world and meets or exceeds Brazil,s 
<br>requirements while providing a sound basis for the key 
<br>U.S.-Brazil partnership. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) USD/ATL Carter highlighted the growing closeness of 
<br>
<br>BRASILIA 00001094 002 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>the U.S. and Brazilian defense industries. As industry 
<br>becomes more interdependent, such partnerships bring added 
<br>benefits to all sides. Noting that Brazil,s defense 
<br>strategy (ref c) linked defense modernization to national 
<br>development, Carter said that partnership with the U.S. would 
<br>help Brazil achieve its strategic goals. Carter told the 
<br>Brazilians that he had chaired the committee making key tech 
<br>release decisions. Because Brazil was a friendly country, 
<br>with a well-developed aviation sector and a good record of 
<br>technology security, there was no reason not to approve 
<br>transfers to Brazil. Boeing was offering a large workshare 
<br>in the project that would create an opportunity for Brazil to 
<br>participate in ongoing F18 development, sustaining jobs for 
<br>Brazilian industry over the life cycle of the aircraft. 
<br>Finally, Carter noted that tech transfers to Brazil would 
<br>grow easier with time and experience. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Defense Minister Jobim said that the information 
<br>provided by the Tauscher/Carter team was important and 
<br>merited careful review while repeating his view (see ref a) 
<br>that tech transfer would be the key for a Brazilian decision. 
<br>Jobim told Tauscher privately that he believed Boeing should 
<br>have &first refusal8 on the sale and that he viewed the 
<br>U.S. as Brazil,s &main partner.8 He also cautioned that 
<br>the final decision would be made by President Lula and that 
<br>he did not know what Lula,s position would be, a point he 
<br>underlined in an August 7 conversation with Ambassador Sobel. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Air Force Chief Saito called the high-level 
<br>assurances on tech transfer &music to my ears.8 His 
<br>objective in the competition is to position the Brazilian Air 
<br>Force (and Brazil aviation industry) for a &technological 
<br>leap.8 Saito praised President Obama,s efforts with 
<br>President Lula to provide assurance of USG support. He also 
<br>laid down a marker that Brazil expected that a significant 
<br>amount of the work of integrating Brazilian weapons on the 
<br>FX2 would be done in Brazil, a requirement that will create 
<br>practical difficulties for any manufacturer. EMBASSY 
<br>COMMENT: Saito is a former fighter pilot, and it is 
<br>increasingly clear that he will favor the most capable 
<br>aircraft -- the Super Hornet. END COMMENT. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) During the meeting with Foreign Minister Celso 
<br>Amorim, U/S Tauscher hand-delivered a letter from the 
<br>Secretary assuring that State had approved all necessary 
<br>technology transfer in furtherance of the propoased sale. In 
<br>response to Amorim,s concern about the &ban8 on Brazilian 
<br>re-sale of Super Tucanos, she assured him that there was no 
<br>ban, that the previous administration had made a &gaffe8 in 
<br>not considering Brazil,s interests when denying the sale to 
<br>Venezuela, and that in the future such decisions would be 
<br>made on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward its 
<br>significance to our growing bilateral partnership. U/S 
<br>Tauscher also met with Embraer President Frederico Currado 
<br>and briefed him about the Secretary,s letter and the USG 
<br>commitment to meeting all Brazilian tech transfer 
<br>requirements. Currado was clear that he believed a 
<br>partnership with Boeing was in Embraer,s interests and would 
<br>carry significant long-term benefits for the company. 
<br>Brazilian Senator Heraclito Fortes, a supporter of Boeing,s 
<br>bid and the second in the Senate leadership, also believed 
<br>that USG assurances of tech transfers would be important but 
<br>refused to speculate on Boeing,s chances for the final 
<br>decision, noting that there was little confidence in the 
<br>United States among President Lula,s advisors. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU) U/S Tauscher,s visit received strongly positive 
<br>coverage in the Brazilian media. A feature story in Estado 
<br>Sao Paulo August 6 highlighted the importance of the 
<br>U.S.-Brazil partnership and the Secretary,s assurances on 
<br>tech transfer. These points were picked up by a number of 
<br>other news outlets, although the coverage was somewhat 
<br>eclipsed by reporting on the supposed U.S. bases in Columbia. 
<br>There remains strong interest from the media in seeing the 
<br>text of the Secretary,s letter. At the same time, we are 
<br>seeing the beginnings of a counter attack from Boeing,s 
<br>competitors in the press on two fronts: first that the Super 
<br>Hornet, although highly capable, would be too expensive, and 
<br>second that, because the F18 is currently operational, its 
<br>technology is &frozen,8 not leaving Brazil an opportunity 
<br>to participate in technological development.

<br>
<br>COMMENT: 
<br>-------- 
<br>¶9. (C) The combination of the President,s intervention 
<br>with Lula, the Secretary,s letter and the visit of Under 
<br>Secretaries Tauscher and Carter has created a strong momentum 
<br>in favor of the Super Hornet. As noted by MOD Jobim, 
<br>however, the final decision will be political and will be 
<br>made by President Lula, probably in September. With a 
<br>Swedish lobbying team subsequently visiting and the early 
<br>September Sarkozy visit on the horizon, further USG efforts 
<br>will be needed for a successful conclusion. Post recommends 
<br>continued high-level approaches to Saito, Jobim and Lula to 
<br>underline the Tauscher/Carter message on the importance of 
<br>our partnership and the mutual benefits of a fighter sale. 
<br>This message could be reinforced from the White House as 
<br>appropriate. We should also be prepared to see our 
<br>commitment to tech transfer questioned. Folha de Sao Paulo 
<br>has already printed an op-ed (probably inspired by the MRE) 
<br>suggesting that despite the Secretary,s letter, the State 
<br>Department may block technology transfer. On August 12, 
<br>Valor Economico quoted the text of the Secretary,s letter 
<br>and its categorical support for the transfer. Despite this 
<br>helpful development, the USG will need to be able to respond 
<br>to doubts as to the Secretary's sincerity. Post will also 
<br>continue to brief Brazilian leaders as appropriate on the USG 
<br>approval of technology transfer. Boeing leaders reinforced 
<br>this message during their August 12-13 visit to Brasilia. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (U) Under Secretaries Tauscher and Carter have cleared 
<br>this message.
