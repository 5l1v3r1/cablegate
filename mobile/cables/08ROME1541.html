<br>SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR CRISIS MANAGEMENT TRAINING FOR VATICAN 
<br>
<br>REF: STATE 128554 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Classified by DCM Liz Dibble for reasons 1.4 (b) and 
<br>(d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (U) This is an action request. See para 3. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) Action request: Embassy Vatican requests the 
<br>Department to explore designing and funding a crisis 
<br>management tabletop exercise with the Vatican security 
<br>services. The purpose of the exercise is twofold: first, to 
<br>enhance the Vatican's ability to respond to a crisis; and, 
<br>second, to foster a dialogue with the Vatican on 
<br>counter-terrorism. Al-Qaeda has publicly identified the Pope 
<br>and the Catholic church as an enemy ("Crusaders"), and 
<br>Vatican City attracts hundreds of thousands of American 
<br>citizen visitors each year, both tourists and pilgrims. For 
<br>example, the Vatican museums welcome up to 25,000 visitors 
<br>each day, a substantial number of whom are U.S. citizens. 
<br>The RSO, FBI legal attachQ, and regional CT coordinator at 
<br>Embassy Rome endorse this proposal, and Embassies Vatican and 
<br>Rome are prepared to work with the Vatican officials to shape 
<br>the proposal, as appropriate. End Action Request. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) In recent years, the head of the Vatican Gendarmerie, 
<br>Domenico Giani, has on occasion solicited specific security 
<br>training from the FBI, most recently seeking explosives 
<br>ordnance training for members of the Gendarmerie at Quantico. 
<br>But, in general, Giani has been reluctant to engage in a 
<br>comprehensive dialogue with the United States about Vatican 
<br>capabilities and preparedness to respond to a terrorist 
<br>attack. In November 2008, however, Embassy Vatican DCM 
<br>Julieta Valls Noyes spoke with Giani and proposed conducting 
<br>a joint tabletop exercise on crisis management. Giani 
<br>responded positively to this suggestion, which was presented 
<br>during a conversation about Al-Qaeda's threat to the Vatican. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Comment: Due to the Holy See's sensitivity about 
<br>being seen to be too close to any one state, it has been 
<br>challenging to foster a security dialogue with Vatican City 
<br>officials that includes a comprehensive needs assessment. 
<br>This is especially a concern given the high number of 
<br>Americans who visit Vatican City each year, the known 
<br>Al-Qaeda antipathy to the Pope, and the Vatican's conviction 
<br>that its facilities must be easily accessible to all 
<br>Catholics. Giani's interest in a crisis management exercise 
<br>offers an opportunity to open the door to a more substantial 
<br>dialogue that would help the United States be better placed 
<br>to help the Vatican prepare to deal with terrorist threats. 
<br>End Comment.
