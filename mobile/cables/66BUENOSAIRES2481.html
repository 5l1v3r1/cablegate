<br>SUBJECT:  EXTENDED NATIONAL JURISDICTIONS OVER HIGH SEAS 
<br> 
<br>REF: STATE 106206 CIRCULAR; STATE CA-3400 NOV 2, 1966 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  PRESS REPORTS AND VARIETY EMBASSY SOURCES CONFIRM 
<br>NEW ARGENTINE LEGISLATION UNILATERALLY CHANGING SEAS JURIS- 
<br>DICTION NOW UNDER ADVANCED REVIEW.  REPORTEDLY LAW WOULD 
<br>ESTABLISH SIX MILE TERRITORIAL SEA, PLUS ANOTHER SIX MILES 
<br>OF EXCLUSIVE FISHING JURISDICTION, PLUS ANOTHER EXTENDED ZONE 
<br>OF "PREFERENTIAL JURISDICTION" FOR FISHING PURPOSES.  DRAFT- 
<br>LAW UNDER CONSIDERATION IN ARGENTINE SENATE BEFORE JUNE 28 
<br>COUP WOULD HAVE DEFINED ZONE OF PREFERENTIAL JURISDICTION 
<br>AS "EPICONTINENTAL SEA OUT TO 200 METER ISOBAR".  IN SOUTHERN 
<br>ARGENTINA THIS ZONE SEVERAL HUNDRED MILES WIDE AND BLANKETS 
<br>FALKLAND ISLANDS. 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  NAVATT STATES ARGENTINE NAVY THINKING OF PREFERENTIAL 
<br>JURISDICTION OUT TO 200 MILES (AS IN PERU, ECUADOR, CHILE) 
<br>RATHER THAN EPICONTINENTAL SEA.  200 MILE LIMIT DOES NOT 
<br>RPT NOT REACH FALKLANDS.  ARGENTINE NAVY OFF TOLD NAVATT 
<br>"200 MILE LIMIT SOON WILL BE STANDARD THROUGH HEMISPHERE". 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  FONOFF OFFICIALS REFERRING TO RECENT BRAZILIAN AND US 
<br>LEGISLATION HAVE INFORMALLY INDICATED DECISION ALREADY 
<br>FINAL RE SIX MILE TERRITORIAL SEA PLUS SIX MILE EXCLUSIVE 
<br>FISHING JURISDICTION, BUT THAT "PREFERENTIAL JURISDICTION" 
<br>STILL UNDER STUDY.  TWO FONOFF MEN VOLUNTARILY AND INFORMALLY 
<br>SOUGHT EMBASSY REACTION TO POSSIBLE EXTENDED PREFERENTIAL 
<br>JURISDICTION BY SUGGESTING THAT US IN FACT HAS ACCEPTED 
<br>UNILATERALLY CREATED ECUADORIAN, PERUVIAN AND CHILEAN 200 MILE 
<br>LIMITS.  EMBOFF REJECTED IDEA US ACCEPTS THESE LIMITS IN ANY 
<br>WAY AND POINTED OUT 1965 AMENDMENTS TO AID LEGISLATION AIMED 
<br>AT FURTHER PROTECTING US FISHING RIGHTS. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  FONOFF LEGAL ADVISOR CONCEDES DISTINCTION BETWEEN 
<br>"EXCLUSIVE" AND "PREFERENTIAL" FISHING JURISDICTION A SEMANTIC 
<br>NICETY.  HE UNDERSTANDS THAT IN ZONE OF "PREFERENTIAL" JURIS- 
<br>DICTION ARGENTINA WOULD CLAIM RIGHT TO TAX, LICENSE AND OTHER- 
<br>WISE CONTROL ALL ACTIVITIES RELATED TO EXPLOITATION OF 
<br>RESOURCES OF SEA. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  DRAFT LEGISLATION ON SEAS JURISDICTION LAY DORMANT UNTIL 
<br>SUDDEN AND SUBSTANTIAL IN FISHIN ARGENTINE EPICONTINENTAL SEAS 
<br>BY CUBAN AND EAST EUROPEAN (ESPECIALLY SOVIET) VESSELS PAST 
<br>SIX MONTHS ALARMED ARGENTINE ARMED FORCES.  (SEE NAVATT IR 
<br>5-804-0-140-66 OF NOV 18) NOT RPT NOT ALL SOVIET VESSELS WERE 
<br>FISHING OR FACTORY TYPES.  FONOFF SOURCES INFORMALLY STATE 
<br>ARMED FORCES PRESSURE MAKES EMISSION NEW LAW IMPERATIVE, QUITE 
<br>POSSIBLY APPEARING WITHIN NEXT FEW WEEKS.  WHEN ASKED BY FONOFF 
<br>MEN ABOUT "SECURITY PROBLEMS CREATED BY SOVIET TRAWLERS OFF US 
<br>COAST", EMBASSY OFF REPLIED US DID NOT RPT NOT SEE THAT 
<br>UNILATERAL ATTEMPT TO EXTEND SEAS JURISDICTION OFFERED ANY 
<br>REALISTIC SOLUTION FOR POSSIBLE SECURITY PROBLEMS, WHILE SUCH 
<br>ACTION COULD CREATE NEW SOURCES POSSIBLE MISUNDERSTANDING AND 
<br>CONFLICT. 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  RE PAR 3 STATE 106206 BELIEVE OUTLINED PROPOSAL MIGHT 
<br>FORESTALL UNILATERAL ARGENTINE ATTEMPT TO SUBSTANTIALLY EXTEND 
<br>"PREFERENTIAL" FISHING JURISDICTION ONLY IF EMBASSY CAN BE 
<br>AUTHORIZED DISCUSS IDEA WITH ARGENTINES IMMEDIATELY. EVEN THEN 
<br>CHANCES SUCCESS LIMITED BY (A) ADVANCED STAGE PROPOSED ARGENTINE 
<br>LAW AND (B) PRIMACY SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS ARGENTINE THINKING. 
<br>WE WOULD BENEFIT SOME FROM FONOFF LEGAL ADVISORS' QUALMS ABOUT 
<br>UNILATERAL ACTION, AND FROM RESTRAINT OF RECENT BRAZILIAN 
<br>LEGISLATION WHICH DID NOT RPT NOT GO BEYOND 12-MILE LIMIT. 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  FOR DISCUSSION WITH ARGENTINES WOULD MODIFY TEXT IN STATE 
<br>10942 CIRCULAR TO:  (A) MAKE ALL REFERENCES TO ARGENTINA, VICE 
<br>CANADA; (B) REFER TO PROPOSED ARGENTINE CLAIMS OF PREFERENTIAL 
<br>JURISDICTION OVER WATERS WE REGARD AS HIGH SEAS; (C) ELIMINATE 
<br>REFERENCES TO "TRADITIONAL DISTANT WATER FISHERIES", SINCE 
<br>ARGENTINE COAST NOT RPT NOT TRADITIONAL FISHING ZONE (WHEREAS 
<br>NO. 3);  (D) ADD NOTATION THERE NO TRADITIONAL FISHING AND 
<br>CONFINE OPERATIVE AGREEMENT TO PROVISIONS FOR NON-TRADITIONAL 
<br>FISHING; (E) ELIMINATE LAST THREE PARS OF AIDE-MEMOIRE HANDED 
<br>TO CANADIAN AMB. 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  IF AUTHORIZED, ENVISAGE TWO-STEP APPROACH TO FONOFF. 
<br>FIRST, INFORMAL AND ORAL, STRESSING OUR INTEREST IN FREEDOM OF 
<br>HIGH SEAS, NOTING EARLIER FONOFF CONFIRMATION NEW LAW UNDER 
<br>STUDY, OUTLINING OUR PROPOSAL IN GENERAL TERMS.  ON BASIS 
<br>FONOFF REACTION, WE WOULD THEN COUCH AIDE-MEMOIRE IN TERMS 
<br>WHICH WOULD APPEAR MOST LIKELY TO SUCCEED.
