<br>
<br>RABAT 00001018 001.2 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>Classified By: DCM Robert P. Jackson for reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) Summary: XXXXXXXXXXXX told PolOffs on 
<br>December 30 that despite Dadis Camara's apparent desire to 
<br>depart Morocco (Ref A), he is in no condition to travel and 
<br>will not be able to resume control of the country. Minister 
<br>of National Defense Sekouba Konate and an assistant, Mr. Bah, 
<br>along with Minister of Communications Idrissa Cherif have 
<br>been in Rabat to visit Dadis, but Konate planned to return to 
<br>Guinea by December 31, possibly to present to the Guinean 
<br>people a case for his assumption of power in place of Dadis. 
<br>The next ten days would be telling and potentially chaotic 
<br>for the country, according to XXXXXXXXXXXX, but with the 
<br>assistance of the international community, Konate should be 
<br>able to control the army and avert violence that could have 
<br>regional implications. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) XXXXXXXXXXXX told PolOffs on December 
<br>30 that Dadis Camara was in no condition to travel and would 
<br>not be able to control Guinea again. XXXXXXXXXXXX said 
<br>that Dadis Camara still had a bullet in his head, suffered from impaired 
<br>vision and speech, and was not fully aware of his 
<br>surroundings. XXXXXXXXXXXX  admitted that he had not 
<br>seen Dadis; according to him only Konate and Bah were allowed 
<br>into his room. Regarding earlier news reports that Dadis was 
<br>preparing to speak to the Guinean people, XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br> said that if Dadis could speak to the media, he certainly would 
<br>have by now. Evidently Dadis also suffered from heart 
<br>problems unrelated to the gunshot wounds. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) Konate evidently was not in the best of health, 
<br>either, and sought medical consultation while here in Rabat. 
<br>Reportedly a heavy drinker, Konate suffered from liver 
<br>problems consistent with his intake of large amounts of 
<br>alcohol. On December 30, senior Moroccan military officials 
<br>separately questioned Konate's fitness to lead, calling him 
<br>weak. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) For XXXXXXXXXXXX,  Konate's travel to  Rabat allowed him to return to Guinea and report on the basis of his  first-hand knowledge that Dadis was unable to continue in his  role as leader of Guinea, paving the way for Konate to assume  power for a transitional period. Were Konate to attempt to  take control without having undertaken the trip to Rabat to  see Dadis, he would have been perceived as a traitor to Dadis  and have no legitimacy before the Guinean people and army.  Konate would then have Cherif and Claude Pivi, another CNDD  leader, arrested, XXXXXXXXXXXX said. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) XXXXXXXXXXXX went on to say that Cherif 
<br>was behind demonstrations being planned for Conakry, 
<br>while Pivi, who was from the same ethnic group as Dadis, 
<br>might organize supporters on an ethnic basis and incite 
<br>clashes with other groups. Given that ethnic and national 
<br>boundaries are not coterminous, this could affect neighboring 
<br>countries and plunge the entire region into chaos (Ref B), 
<br>asserted XXXXXXXXXXXX. With the help of the United States 
<br>and European countries, Konate would be able to take power 
<br>and control the army, which lacked discipline and had too many 
<br>crooks and militias, but XXXXXXXXXXXX did not specify what sort of 
<br>assistance from the international community would be 
<br>necessary. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) Comment: XXXXXXXXXXXX urged intervention, both to 
<br>keep Dadis out of Guinea and to support an effort by Konate 
<br>to take power in the country, in order to forestall 
<br>devastating ethnic violence. His argument that Dadis would 
<br>
<br>RABAT 00001018 002.2 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>have made a public statement by now if he could have is 
<br>compelling, while his comment that Konate would have other 
<br>CNDD leaders arrested suggests that the fate of Guinea does 
<br>not depend on Dadis alone. Dadis has amassed militias and 
<br>enjoys some popular support (Ref B), and for XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br> his return would undoubtedly lead to violence and unrest. 
<br>His continued absence, however, might not preclude it. 
<br>End Comment. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (U) Tripoli minimize considered.
