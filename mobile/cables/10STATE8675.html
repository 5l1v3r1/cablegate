<br>SUBJECT: EXBS: DOE/INECP REPORTING CABLE FOR COMMODITY 
<br>IDENTIFICATION TRAINING, DUBAI, 10-13 JAN 2010 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Jerry Guilbert for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (U) The Department of Energy,s (DOE) International 
<br>Nonproliferation Export Control Program (INECP), through 
<br>funding provided by the Department of State,s Export Control 
<br>and Related Border Security Assistance (EXBS) Program, 
<br>conducted Commodity Identification Training (CIT) for Dubai 
<br>Customs, Jan 10 ) 13, 2010.  CIT teaches customs agents to 
<br>recognize WMD-related dual-use items, and this event marked 
<br>the first time INECP had delivered any type of training in 
<br>the Unite Arab Emirates (UAE). 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (U) The INECP team consisted of Chris Walker (DOE HQ); 
<br>Heidi Mahy and Kevin Whattam (Pacific Northwest National 
<br>Laboratory); Basil Picologlou (Argonne National Laboratory); 
<br>and Kirk Walker (Kansas City Plant).  Lisa Meyers (DOS/Office 
<br>of Counterproliferation Initiatives) and Tyler Hoffmann (EXBS 
<br>Advisor for the Middle East) also attended.  The Dubai office 
<br>of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement provided 
<br>organizational support and attended the course. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (U) The course began with brief overviews of Weapons and 
<br>Mass Destruction and delivery systems (missiles), which 
<br>occupied most of the workshop,s first day.  The remaining 
<br>three days consisted of about three dozen modules covering a 
<br>range of controlled goods, including machine tools, 
<br>gyroscopes, (precursor) chemicals, and many others.  The 
<br>course also featured several practical exercises and 
<br>&games8 to test the participants, grasp of the material. 
<br>Unsurprisingly, the attendees were not particularly lively 
<br>during the overview presentations, but they showed strong 
<br>interest in the commodity presentations and especially the 
<br>exercises.  Dubai Customs brought an x-ray van to the course, 
<br>allowing both instructors and participants to see how some 
<br>controlled goods (that is, the ones INECP brought along as 
<br>teaching aids) look when x-rayed, probably the part of the 
<br>course that generated the most interest and excitement.  This 
<br>was the first time any Customs agency had provided an X-ray 
<br>van at a CIT seminar. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (U) Attendance on the part of Dubai Customs varied from 
<br>about 15 participants on the first day to around 20 or so for 
<br>most of Days 2 through 4, plus a few individuals from the 
<br>training division responsible for organizing the event.  Most 
<br>of the attendees work in Port Rashid, but there were also 
<br>attendees from the Jebel Ali, Cargo Village, UAE-Oman border 
<br>crossing, and two  representatives from Dubai Customs, WMD 
<br>division.  Mr. Mohammed Foolad, the Dubai Custom,s Manager 
<br>for Non-proliferation of WMD, was the senior-most person in 
<br>attendance and had a good working knowledge about WMD related 
<br>dual-use items from his work.  He leads a special unit of 
<br>five individuals (one of whom attended the course with him). 
<br>He  requested extra copies of the printed course materials 
<br>and electronic versions of all the Arab-language materials, 
<br>which the team provided to him. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (U) Overall, the level of interest was quite good.  The 
<br>audience was fairly participatory, and showed a great deal of 
<br>energy in particular while x-raying the goods and during a 
<br>wrap-up exercise, in which groups of participants identify 
<br>pictures of goods from the course.  Multiple participants 
<br>stated that cooperation should continue in the future; time 
<br>will tell if the sentiment was genuine. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (S)  In a side conversation between Mr. Foolad and Ms. 
<br>Meyers, he noted that his job is to coordinate WMD- related 
<br>cases.  He works closely with the Dubai General Directorate 
<br>of State Security on sensitive issues.  When asked about the 
<br>Export Control office, he noted that he works with them, but 
<br>that they are new to this issue, while Dubai Customs has been 
<br>working on this issue for years.  He noted that the UAE was 
<br>developing a computer system that will allow Emirate- level 
<br>customs offices to communicate with each other. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (S//NF) CONTD: On targeting, Mr. Foolad noted that Dubai 
<br>Customs is stopping WMD related cargo on their own (without 
<br>information from foreign governments) using their targeting 
<br>methods.  They currently use the control lists of the various 
<br>regimes to target controlled goods, as well as information 
<br>provided by the United States, Germany, and others to target 
<br>end users.  They have a handbook created by Dubai Customs to 
<br>help their officers physically identify WMD related dual-use 
<br>goods, but noted they have had difficulty finding pictures of 
<br>certain Wassenaar military- related items.  He described a 
<br>case of glass fiber stopped on its way from the Netherlands 
<br>to Iran, as well as some 7075 aluminum.  He noted that they 
<br>really need more information on who the suspect end users 
<br>are, as they could use this information to help them better 
<br>target WMD end users.  He mentioned that they routinely find 
<br>that the same phone numbers are associated with different 
<br>companies. 
<br>¶8.  (S//NF) CONTD: Mr. Foolad explained the serious problems 
<br>they are facing at their Cargo Village facility, which is 
<br>where they handle air cargo shipments.  He noted that they 
<br>have to look at over 9,000 shipments a month going to one 
<br>country of concern (i.e., Iran).  He noted how difficult this 
<br>is due to the quick time frame, but how necessary given the 
<br>sensitivity.  NOTE:  Mr. Foolad seemed to take the course, 
<br>and moreover his responsibilities leading the WMD unit, very 
<br>seriously.
