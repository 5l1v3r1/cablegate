<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: While the results of Ukraine's March 26
<br>parliamentary and local elections are not yet final, and
<br>negotiations to form a majority Rada coalition have not yet
<br>concluded, it is already clear that the elections highlighted
<br>a number of winners and losers, as well as trends in
<br>Ukraine's developing political landscape. Fundamentally,
<br>voting for the Verkhovna Rada reinforced the results of the
<br>ultimate Orange win in the 2004 presidential election with
<br>remarkably similar aggregate numbers: a majority of
<br>Ukrainians supported politicians/parties with overtly
<br>pro-Western, pro-reform orientations. The 2006 results also
<br>confirmed substantial shifts in the electorate from the 2002
<br>Rada election. Besides Western-oriented, pro-reform
<br>Ukrainians, winners were, first and foremost, the Tymoshenko
<br>Bloc (BYuT), and secondarily Party of Regions and the
<br>Socialists, plus the Democratic Initiatives Polling firm and
<br>newly empowered locally elected authorities. The biggest
<br>losers were Rada Speaker Lytvyn as an individual and
<br>President Yushchenko's People's Union Our Ukraine as a party,
<br>secondarily Orange splinter forces like Kostenko's Ukrainian
<br>People's Party, Pora-Reforms and Order (Pora-PRP), and Yuri
<br>Karmazin's Bloc, as well as pro-Russian hard oppositionists
<br>Natalya Vitrenko, the SPDU(o), and the Communists. Comment:
<br>With only five parties in the Rada, and Vitrenko forced to
<br>reprise her role as a street-protest gadfly, the Ukrainian
<br>political scene may actually be more stable than many had
<br>feared leading up to the election, even though the same
<br>intra-Orange squabbling and Orange-Blue battles are almost
<br>guaranteed to continue in 2006 and beyond. End summary and
<br>comment.
<br>
<br>The real winners: Ukraine, those who were on the Maidan
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) While election tables from the 2006 Rada elections
<br>will show that Regions received a 32-percent plurality, the
<br>real winners of the March 26 election were Ukraine and the
<br>Ukrainian people themselves, which pulled off the most
<br>successful election among former Soviet republics outside of
<br>the Baltics, along with a majority of Ukrainians who had
<br>embraced a fundamentally pro-Western, pro-reform future in
<br>2004 by voting for Yushchenko and then taking to the streets
<br>to prevent Yanukovych and the Kuchma regime elements from
<br>stealing victory. Despite incompetence and intra-Orange
<br>squabbling by the "Maidan" team in office, significantly
<br>lower growth figures, and disillusionment among ordinary
<br>Ukrainians in 2005, voters on March 26 delivered a remarkably
<br>similar percentage of votes to the parties who stood together
<br>on Maidan as they had to Yushchenko in 2004; just over half
<br>the voters voted for Orange parties or similarly oriented
<br>forces. In the December 2004 presidential re-vote,
<br>Yushchenko received 52% of the vote to Yanukovych's 44.
<br>(Note: With 99.95 percent of precincts reporting, the Orange
<br>forces of BYuT, Our Ukraine, and the Socialists will have 243
<br>seats in the Rada, or 54 percent.)
<br>
<br>Party winner: BYuT
<br>------------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) Based on expectations heading into the election, the
<br>runaway winner March 26 appears to be BYuT, which most
<br>pre-election polls for months had predicted would finish
<br>third with around 15% of the vote. In the competition for
<br>Maidan votes, BYuT bested Our Ukraine handily, some 22% to
<br>14%; BYuT won pluralities in 13 central and western Ukrainian
<br>oblasts plus Kiev, compared to only three for Our Ukraine.
<br>BYuT also more than tripled its 2002 Rada vote (7.2%).
<br>Furthermore, BYuT built organizations in eastern and southern
<br>Ukraine, often running second to Regions; only BYuT and the
<br>Socialists can currently lay claim to being truly national
<br>parties. BYuT may have benefited from being out of
<br>government, tapping into voter discontent, as well as being
<br>led by the most charismatic of Ukrainian politicians, Yuliya
<br>Tymoshenko. But BYuT's effective grass roots organization
<br>and focused campaign tactics deserve a great deal of credit
<br>(ref A). That leaves BYuT and Tymoshenko herself
<br>well-positioned for future election cycles (2009
<br>presidential, 2011 Rada).
<br>
<br>Secondary winners: Regions and Socialists
<br>-----------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) While many Western press stories immediately labeled
<br>Yanukovych and Party of Regions the "victors" in the March 26
<br>vote based on their plurality, Regions' success is more
<br>nuanced. Regions did not aspire to be a national party in
<br>
<br>Kiev 00001261 002 of 004
<br>
<br>
<br>this election cycle; instead, as Yanukovych told us in early
<br>November 2005, Regions was running to protect its base in the
<br>east and south against the Communists and Vitrenko (ref B).
<br>Regions ran a well-financed, well-organized campaign,
<br>successfully consolidating that base, which had largely voted
<br>Communist in the 1998 and 2002 Rada elections. Regions won
<br>the nine oblasts plus Sevastopol that Yanukovych carried in
<br>2004, securing slightly more than two-thirds of the support
<br>Yanukovych received then. Employing American consultants
<br>rather than Kremlin operatives to advise it on tactics and
<br>outreach to the media and Western interlocutors, Regions also
<br>partially rehabilitated an image tarnished by its attempts to
<br>steal the 2004 election. Regions' challenge looking forward
<br>will be to develop a strategy that appeals beyond its base.
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) The Socialists (SPU) can also be considered a
<br>secondary winner in the 2006 cycle, even if they aspired to
<br>more than the 5.7% they received in their predicted
<br>fourth-place finish. The Socialists expanded a nationwide
<br>party structure and polled nearly evenly across the country,
<br>the only such Ukrainian political force to do so; they
<br>confirmed party leader Olexander Moroz's 2004 presidential
<br>first-round third-place support (5.8%), which pushed them
<br>past the Communists for the first time as Ukraine's leading
<br>"leftist" (in traditional European terms) force (ref B).
<br>While the Socialist niche is modest, it is well-defined, with
<br>a generally forward-looking, positive political agenda (its
<br>economic ideas, however, remain antediluvian). The SPU
<br>succeeded despite that fact that it being in power deprived
<br>it of the chance to tap into the protest vote, which had
<br>contributed to the SPU's 6.9% showing in the 2002 Rada
<br>elections.
<br>
<br>Democratic Initiatives and the Exit Poll Consortium
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) The widely respected Democratic Initiatives (DI)
<br>polling firm should also be considered one of the winners of
<br>the 2006 election cycle. Alone of Ukraine's major polling
<br>firms, DI captured the crucial dynamic of the campaign end
<br>game -- BYuT surging, and Our Ukraine slipping -- in its
<br>final published poll March 10 (note: Ukrainian law bans
<br>polls two weeks prior to elections). While the Institute of
<br>Social and Political Psychology of the Ukrainian Academy of
<br>Pedagogical Sciences showed BYuT ahead of Our Ukraine in its
<br>final March 10 poll, it did not have a track record of
<br>previous polls; all other polling firms showed Our Ukraine
<br>holding onto the 3-4% lead over BYuT it had enjoyed since
<br>mid-January. Democratic Initiatives combined with the
<br>Razumkov Center and the Kiev International Institute of
<br>Sociology to run an exit poll March 26 that accurately
<br>predicted the final results of the election, within their
<br>stated margin of error.
<br>
<br>Local and regional elected officials
<br>------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) The winner in the Kiev mayoral race, Leonid
<br>Chernovetsky, shocked everyone in besting not only incumbent
<br>Mayor Omelchenko but also ex-WBC heavyweight boxing champion
<br>Klychko, running on the Pora-PRP ticket. Chernovetsky ran a
<br>stealth campaign which clearly managed to secure a larger
<br>share of the anti-Omelchenko vote than Klychko.
<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU) Finally, other winners in the March 26 elections,
<br>but which received little attention internationally, are the
<br>oblast, town, and district councils that were elected along
<br>with mayors. Under constitutional reform and the delayed
<br>administrative reform, which will serve as a counterpart to
<br>changes in governance at the national level in Kiev, these
<br>provincial and local bodies will receive more resources and
<br>authority in the coming years. The elections under
<br>proportional representation clarified allegiances to voters
<br>previously faced with many unaffiliated local strongmen,
<br>improving accountability; the election also gives the
<br>councils a clear democratic mandate in negotiating with the
<br>center, including the unelected governors appointed by Kiev.
<br>
<br>The Big Losers: Lytvyn and Our Ukraine
<br>--------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶9. (SBU) The biggest individual loser of the 2006 election
<br>cycle was undoubtedly Rada Speaker Lytvyn, whose eponymous
<br>bloc failed to reach the 3-percent threshold for the Rada,
<br>leaving Lytvyn out in the cold. Lytvyn's bloc spent more
<br>money on advertising than any other party but Regions,
<br>according to official Central Election Commission (CEC)
<br>figures, and Lytvyn commanded 63 MPs in the current Rada, 15%
<br>overall. Lytvyn's campaign suffered from fatal flaws,
<br>however. It lacked any real organization beyond a collection
<br>of "names" at the national and local district level, many of
<br>whom were tainted with the Kuchmaist label (note: Lytvyn
<br>
<br>Kiev 00001261 003 of 004
<br>
<br>
<br>served as Kuchma's chief of staff prior to becoming Rada
<br>Speaker in 2002). The Lytvyn bloc had no real message for
<br>voters, beyond proposing itself and Lytvyn as a "referee" to
<br>reunite Ukraine between warring Orange and Blue factions. In
<br>the end, Lytvyn's vote total barely topped 600,000, the
<br>number of members his party claimed to have.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) The biggest party loser was Yushchenko's People's
<br>Union Our Ukraine (PUOU), the core of the Our Ukraine
<br>election bloc, which defied pre-election polls to slump into
<br>third place and below 14% on election day.xxxxxxxxxxxx had told us in late January that
<br>PUOU's organization was in complete shambles, would stagger
<br>to the election, and would need to rebuild from the ground up
<br>afterwards. Pre-election provincial visits confirmed
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx gloomy assessment; Our Ukraine had no visible,
<br>effective organization outside of Lviv and several other
<br>western provinces, relying primarily on a slick, expensive TV
<br>campaign and Orange Revolution nostalgia. Voters did not
<br>respond.
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Our Ukraine's disappointing performance -- which has
<br>been characterized by many as a defeat for Yushchenko -- is
<br>also a reminder that Yushchenko's electorate in 2004 voted
<br>for him out of several motivations, not just in favor of
<br>Yushchenko. One early 2005 survey indicated that only 37
<br>percent of those who said they had voted for Yushchenko had
<br>done so primarily because they supported Yushchenko
<br>personally; 34 percent did so primarily to protest Kuchmaism,
<br>and 29 percent did so primarily to defend their right to
<br>choose. PUOU's party leadership is currently dominated by
<br>the same unpopular Orange oligarchs -- Poroshenko, Zhvaniya,
<br>Tretyakov, Chervonenko -- who Yushchenko was forced to
<br>jettison in the September 2005 government shakeup, but who
<br>still form Yushchenko's "kitchen cabinet." Our Ukraine's
<br>poor organization for the 2006 election cycle does not bode
<br>well either for Yushchenko's presumed run for re-election in
<br>2009 or for the next Rada cycle in 2011, unless it follows
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx advice and rebuilds its organization.
<br>
<br>The Orange Splinters - repeating the mistakes of the 1990s
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------------
<br>
<br>¶12. (SBU) Two of the more organized party elements of the
<br>initial five-party Our Ukraine bloc that won a 23.6%
<br>plurality in the 2002 Rada elections, Yuri Kostenko's
<br>Ukrainian People's Party (UPP) and the Reforms and Order
<br>Party (PRP), decided to run independently from the Our
<br>Ukraine bloc in 2006, primarily because of disagreements with
<br>Yushchenko and his entourage. In doing so, they repeated the
<br>mistake both made in 1998, when they ran separately and
<br>failed to reach the threshold. While both factions will
<br>enter a variety of city and provincial councils with their
<br>modified blocs (Kostenko-Plushch, Pora-PRP), their vote
<br>totals in the Rada race (1.9 and 1.5%, respectively), along
<br>with that of Our Ukraine MP Yuri Karmazin, who ran separately
<br>(0.7%), were lost.
<br>
<br>Pro-Russian hardliner opposition - marginalized, for now
<br>--------------------------------------------- -----------
<br>
<br>¶13. (SBU) Regions' heavily pro-Russian campaign rhetoric
<br>(pro-Russian language, anti-NATO, pro-Single Economic Space
<br>with Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan) undercut the appeal of
<br>two parties who made the trio of issues the center of their
<br>campaigns: Natalya Vitrenko's People's Opposition Bloc
<br>(2.9%) and the Ne Tak! bloc centered around the SPDU(o)
<br>(1.0%), along with the Communists (3.7%). Vitrenko ran a
<br>vigorous street campaign, falling just short of the
<br>threshold. The SPDU(o), which received 6.3% of the 2002 Rada
<br>vote, bought extensive billboard ads throughout urban Ukraine
<br>but had no organization or street presence whatsoever. The
<br>2006 results and disappearance from the political scene
<br>confirmed the loss that it and its leader Viktor Medvedchuk
<br>suffered in 2004 as the most reviled force behind the
<br>excesses of the Kuchma regime. While the Communists will
<br>have 21 seats in the next Rada sitting, their 2006 showing is
<br>but a shadow of the 20% they received in 2002. They ran a
<br>nearly invisible campaign; their dedicated electorate is
<br>dying off, and Regions has effectively taken the eastern and
<br>southern anti-Kiev protest vote that voted communist in 1998
<br>and 2002.
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) It would be a mistake to write off the pro-Russian
<br>marginalized opposition completely, however. Vitrenko has
<br>proven staying power on the streets of Ukraine, with many
<br>observers suspecting she receives financial support from
<br>Russia. If Regions ever transforms itself into a more
<br>Western-looking, reform-oriented force, part of its
<br>disgruntled "protest" electorate will likely turn elsewhere
<br>to voice its discontent. With the Communists dying and the
<br>SPDU(o) disappearing, Vitrenko may well finally make it into
<br>
<br>Kiev 00001261 004 of 004
<br>
<br>
<br>the Rada as the next protest vehicle.
