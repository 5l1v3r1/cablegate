<br>
<br>Classified By: POLITICAL MINISTER COUNSELOR JOSIAH ROSENBLATT FOR REASO 
<br>NS 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) SUMMARY: France,s chief counterterrorism judge, 
<br>Jean-Louis Bruguiere, told us on January 19 that a recent 
<br>surge in overall GSPC activities worried French 
<br>counterterrorism officials, who are convinced there is now a 
<br>significantly higher threat against France and its interests 
<br>abroad. Tunisian security services, he said, had essentially 
<br>shut the French out, preferring to deny the existence of a 
<br>threat. Morocco was cooperative, while Algeria remained hot 
<br>and cold, or "as usual." 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) Summary continued: Operational relations between 
<br>France and the U.S. were excellent, Bruguiere said. He also 
<br>praised DNI John Negroponte,s comments on Pakistan, adding 
<br>that President Musharraf did not exercise control over all of 
<br>Pakistan and that this country posed the most immediate 
<br>threat to global security. He confirmed that he had 
<br>conferred with GoF officials, including President Chirac, on 
<br>the timing and fallout of his issuance of arrest warrants 
<br>against top Kigame aides and warned against better U.S. 
<br>relations with Rwanda. Bruguiere also confirmed rumors that 
<br>he will likely be leaving the top terrorism court to pursue 
<br>political ambitions. END SUMMARY 
<br>
<br>GSPC THREAT AND THE MAGHREB 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) France,s chief counterterrorism judge, Jean-Louis 
<br>Bruguiere, told us on January 19 that he found an apparent 
<br>escalation in GSPC activities in the Maghreb during the past 
<br>several months particularly worrisome. France, he said, was 
<br>at a higher state of alert and would likely remain so for the 
<br>foreseeable future. While there was no specific threat 
<br>information, he said the GoF was convinced that cells and 
<br>supporters were prepared to be active in France and Europe. 
<br>The dismantling of at least two, relatively major, Islamic 
<br>cells on French territory every year showed a clear and 
<br>present threat. Information exchange with Tunisia, he said, 
<br>was now virtually non-existent. The Tunisian government was 
<br>either in denial or did not know how to proceed and was 
<br>shutting out the French. Morocco continues to be relatively 
<br>reliable with information, with Algeria as, "as usual," 
<br>excellent on some days and like Tunisia on others. (COMMENT: 
<br>Bruguiere,s characterization of operational cooperation with 
<br>the Maghreb is worse than other C/T contacts have previously 
<br>reported. Bruguiere,s observations, therefore, may or may 
<br>not apply to all of the French intelligence services. End 
<br>Comment) 
<br>
<br>U.S./FRANCE COOPERATION 
<br>----------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) Bruguiere commented that U.S./France judicial and 
<br>operational exchanges remained excellent. He said that while 
<br>France,s legal system gave him much more discretion than the 
<br>U.S. system, our ability to work together was not hindered by 
<br>this; we had to be creative. (Note: Bruguiere was an expert 
<br>witness in the successful prosecution of Ahmed Ressam in the 
<br>famed L.A. trial, the U.S. vs. Ahmed Ressam). 
<br>
<br>PAKISTAN 
<br>-------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) The judge praised DNI John Negroponte,s comments on 
<br>Pakistan during a recent Congressional intelligence briefing. 
<br>He said he was convinced that Pakistan posed the single 
<br>greatest threat to global security. President Musharaf, he 
<br>noted, lacked real control over both the territory of the 
<br>country and security and military agencies. Rogue elements 
<br>from Pakistan, he insisted, were the most likely to provide 
<br>nuclear weapons and safe-haven to terrorists. 
<br>
<br>RWANDA 
<br>------ 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S) Bruguiere confirmed that he had consulted within the 
<br>GoF on his issuance of arrest warrants in the cases brought 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00000322 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>against nine of President Kagame,s top aides for 
<br>assassination of President Habyarimana and three French 
<br>aircraft crew (see reftel A). He said he presented his 
<br>decision to French officials, including President Chirac, as 
<br>his independent judicial right, but chose to consult with 
<br>them because he was convinced of the need to coordinate 
<br>timing with the government. Bruguiere said he was not 
<br>surprised by Rwanda,s official reaction, and said that the 
<br>GoF had prepared for what it thought would be a violent 
<br>response against French nationals. He praised his own 
<br>decision to move forward, adding that the international 
<br>community had a certain moral responsibility, and that his 
<br>actions were in the pursuit of justice. Bruguiere was 
<br>satisfied that the nine individuals he listed could not leave 
<br>Rwanda without fear of arrest, but was doubtful the ICTR 
<br>would take up the case. (COMMENT: Bruguiere,s presented his 
<br>case in a very professional manner, but he did not hide his 
<br>personal desire to see Kagame,s government isolated. He 
<br>warned that closer U.S. ties with Rwanda would be a mistake. 
<br>END COMMENT) 
<br>
<br>BRUGUIERE MOVING ON? 
<br>-------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Since 1982 Bruguiere has been one of the leading 
<br>players in the French fight against terrorism, and he is 
<br>considered a leading world expert in terrorism. He has been 
<br>the chief of the French counterterrorism court, created in 
<br>1986, since its inception. He has survived at least one 
<br>direct assassination attempt, and is the most visible 
<br>counterterrorism figure in France. Bruguiere,s ambitions 
<br>have now turned to the political, however. He told us that 
<br>he is likely to run for a parliamentary seat later this year. 
<br>Bruguiere also casually mentioned that a cabinet post 
<br>(Minister of Justice) would be his first choice. His 
<br>departure will be a loss to the court, but it has become a 
<br>solid institution under his tutelage and it,s clear that 
<br>Bruguiere intends to stay an active part of the C/T community.
