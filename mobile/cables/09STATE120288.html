<br>SUBJECT: U.S. POSTURE ON IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM AND NEXT 
<br>STEPS 
<br> 
<br>Classified by NEA Assistant Secretary Jeffrey D. Feltman 
<br>for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see paragraphs 
<br>3-5. 
<br> 
<br>SUMMARY 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (C) Iran's continued reluctance to cooperate with 
<br>international efforts to build confidence and 
<br>transparency in its nuclear program will be of 
<br>increasing concern to U.S. diplomacy in the weeks ahead. 
<br>Of particular note is Iran's apparent refusal to date to 
<br>agree to an IAEA proposal for Iran to exchange a 
<br>significant portion of its stockpiled low-enriched 
<br>uranium (LEU) for fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor 
<br>(TRR), and the IAEA report of November 16 indicating 
<br>serious unresolved questions about Iran's nuclear 
<br>intentions.  Department requests posts to draw on the 
<br>attached narrative in explaining and securing support 
<br>for recent U.S. and P5+1 efforts to engage Iran on its 
<br>nuclear program, particularly in the lead-up to the IAEA 
<br>Board of Governors meeting on November 26.  End Summary. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>OBJECTIVES 
<br>---------- 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C) FOR ALL POSTS (except Moscow, Paris, Beijing, 
<br>London and Berlin):  Please draw on narrative beginning 
<br>in paragraph 7, and hard questions and answers in 
<br>paragraph 12 to brief host governments on: 
<br> 
<br>-- Persistent U.S. efforts to engage Iran throughout 
<br>2009; 
<br> 
<br>-- Iran's disappointing follow-up to its commitments 
<br>with P5+1 in Geneva on October 1; 
<br> 
<br>-- Details of the TRR proposal and the 
<br>flexibility the U.S., Russia, France and the IAEA, have 
<br>demonstrated to deal with Iranian concerns; and 
<br> 
<br>-- Key findings and implications of the IAEA Director 
<br>General's November 16 report on Iran; and 
<br> 
<br>Posts should also begin laying the foundation for 
<br>possible future action in response to Iran's non- 
<br>cooperation, including at the IAEA (BoG) meeting on 26 
<br>November and prudent preparation in the event of a 
<br>decision to pursue increased pressure on Iran. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (C) SPECIAL REQUEST FOR MOSCOW, PARIS, BEIJING, 
<br>LONDON, AND BERLIN:  Please inform host government that 
<br>we are delivering this message to IAEA members, 
<br>consistent with consultations among Political Directors 
<br>in the P5+1 process.  Posts may share the general tenor 
<br>of our message but do not need to deploy the points 
<br>themselves with host governments. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (C) Posts should not leave any part of this message 
<br>in writing with host governments. 
<br> 
<br>DEADLINE 
<br>-------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (U) Posts should report the results of their efforts 
<br>by November 25. Elisa Catalano (NEA/FO, 202-647-9533, 
<br>CatalanoE@state.sgov.gov) and Richard Nephew (ISN/RA, 
<br>202-647-7680, NephewRM@state.sgov.gov) are the 
<br>Department's POCs for this activity. 
<br> 
<br>BACKGROUND 
<br>---------- 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (SBU) Since the 1 October 2009 meeting of the P5+1 
<br>Political Directors and representatives from Iran, the 
<br>United States has been working closely with its partners 
<br>to fulfill the commitments reached in Geneva and engage 
<br>with Iran to build international confidence in the 
<br>peaceful nature of its nuclear program.  In particular, 
<br>we have focused on supporting the IAEA's proposal for 
<br>refueling the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR), 
<br>facilitating the IAEA's inspection of the previously 
<br>clandestine uranium enrichment plant at Qom, and 
<br>pressing for a follow-on meeting between P5+1 Political 
<br>Directors and Iranian representatives explicitly on 
<br> 
<br>STATE 00120288  002 OF 008 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Iran's nuclear program. 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (C) The results since October 1 have been 
<br>disappointing.  It increasingly appears that Iran will 
<br>decline the IAEA's proposal on TRR, though a definitive 
<br>answer remains outstanding.  In the lead-up to the IAEA 
<br>Board of Governors (BOG) meeting on November 26, Iran 
<br>may try to blame the apparent failure of the TRR 
<br>agreement on intrusive and inflexible demands by western 
<br>powers, rather than its own reluctance or inability to 
<br>reach agreement on the IAEA proposal which responded to 
<br>Iran's request for assistance and was created on the 
<br>basis of Iran's own commitments made in Geneva. 
<br>Although Iran granted IAEA access to Qom, Iran did not 
<br>cooperate with all of the IAEA's requests for access to 
<br>information and personnel and there remain serious 
<br>questions about Iran's intentions for the facility. 
<br>Finally, Iran so far has refused a further meeting with 
<br>the P5+1 to discuss its nuclear program.  The United 
<br>States is now discussing with its P5+1 and other 
<br>partners potential next steps, including how to handle 
<br>these issues at the next meeting of the IAEA BOG. 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (SBU) IAEA Director General (DG) ElBaradei released 
<br>his latest report on Iran on November 16.  The report 
<br>makes clear Iran's continuing lack of transparency and 
<br>cooperation with the IAEA on its nuclear program, 
<br>including in assessing a possible military dimension to 
<br>its program.  As expected, the uranium enrichment 
<br>facility at Qom (also known as the Fordow site) was a 
<br>central element of the report, and the IAEA states that 
<br>Iran's previous failure to declare the facility is 
<br>"inconsistent" with its obligations under its Safeguards 
<br>Agreement. The IAEA's report highlights that revelation 
<br>of the Qom facility raises concerns of additional 
<br>clandestine nuclear sites in Iran and has asked Iran to 
<br>confirm that there are no other undeclared nuclear 
<br>facilities; Iran has yet to respond to this IAEA 
<br>request.  Iran continues to defy UNSC resolutions and 
<br>IAEA BOG resolutions calling on it to adopt the 
<br>Additional Protocol and to provide the access necessary 
<br>for the IAEA to provide assurance as to the absence of 
<br>additional undeclared nuclear activities. 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (C) The P5+1 "dual track" policy towards Iran 
<br>includes both engagement and pressure if Iran does not 
<br>engage constructively.  President Obama, Secretary 
<br>Clinton, and others have identified the end of the year 
<br>as a key period for assessing Iran's responsiveness.  If 
<br>Iran continues to refuse to take meaningful steps to 
<br>meet its international obligations, the international 
<br>community must be prepared to take strong collective 
<br>action on the pressure track. 
<br> 
<br>KEY DIPLOMATIC MESSAGES AND POLICY NARRATIVE 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶11.  (U) Posts should draw on the following key messages 
<br>and policy narrative in briefing host governments. 
<br> 
<br>Key Messages 
<br>------------ 
<br> 
<br>-- We, in coordination with our international partners, 
<br>have demonstrated our willingness to engage 
<br>constructively and respectfully with Iran to address 
<br>long-standing international concerns over its nuclear 
<br>program.  Our approach has clearly and consistently been 
<br>based on the P5+1's dual track strategy. 
<br> 
<br>-- Iran so far has failed to accept a very good and 
<br>balanced IAEA proposal to facilitate the refueling of 
<br>the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR) which would have 
<br>fulfilled an Iranian request, addressed a humanitarian 
<br>need of the Iranian people, and served as a confidence- 
<br>building step to create an opportunity for further 
<br>progress. 
<br> 
<br>-- We look forward to close consultations on how best to 
<br>persuade Iran to engage constructively as we approach 
<br>the IAEA's Board of Governors meeting on November 26 and 
<br>beyond. 
<br> 
<br>Policy Narrative 
<br>---------------- 
<br> 
<br>-- Since President Obama took office, he has made clear 
<br>the willingness of the United States to engage with Iran 
<br>and to seek a new relationship based on mutual respect. 
<br> 
<br>-- He has authorized the United States' full 
<br>participation in diplomatic discussions between the five 
<br>permanent members of the Security Council and Germany 
<br> 
<br>STATE 00120288  003 OF 008 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>and Iran without pre-conditions. 
<br> 
<br>-- The United States has stated its support for Iran's 
<br>full right to a civilian nuclear program within IAEA 
<br>guidelines, provided Iran meets it international 
<br>obligations and carries out its responsibilities within 
<br>the NPT framework. 
<br> 
<br>-- As a way to build confidence, the United States, with 
<br>Russia and France, has also supported the IAEA's 
<br>proposal to positively respond to Iran's request for 
<br>nuclear fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR), in 
<br>spite of Iran's continuing violation of UNSC resolutions 
<br>and noncompliance with IAEA requirements on its nuclear 
<br>program. 
<br> 
<br>-- However, almost one year into the Obama 
<br>administration, Iran has not taken practical, concrete 
<br>steps that would begin to create confidence in its 
<br>nuclear intentions.  Iran: 
<br> 
<br>o       Continues to enrich uranium despite UNSC 
<br>requirements that it suspend such operations; 
<br>o       Revealed it had been building a secret uranium 
<br>enrichment facility at a military base near Qom, 
<br>in violation of its safeguards agreement ; 
<br>o       Continues to refuse cooperation with the IAEA in 
<br>addressing the full range of IAEA questions about 
<br>the peaceful purposes of its nuclear program; 
<br>o       Has not accepted the IAEA proposal to refuel the 
<br>TRR; and 
<br>o       Since meeting with representatives of the five 
<br>permanent members of the Security Council and 
<br>Germany in Geneva on October 1, has refused all 
<br>subsequent efforts to schedule another meeting to 
<br>discuss its nuclear program. 
<br> 
<br>-- Iran's failure to take advantage of these numerous 
<br>opportunities raises serious questions about the 
<br>intentions of its nuclear program that deserve urgent 
<br>international attention.  We look to work closely with 
<br>your government in the run-up to IAEA Board of Governors 
<br>meeting on November 26 and beyond to develop an 
<br>appropriate international response. 
<br> 
<br>Tehran Research Reactor 
<br>----------------------- 
<br> 
<br>-- The IAEA, Russia, France and the United States 
<br>cooperated closely and flexibly to find a way to 
<br>positively respond to Iran's request for fuel for the 
<br>Tehran Research Reactor (TRR) so that it could keep 
<br>running to meet humanitarian medical needs beyond 2010. 
<br> 
<br>-- The TRR refueling proposal offers Iran the 
<br>opportunity to convert its stockpile of low enriched 
<br>uranium (LEU) into higher-enriched fuel with the help of 
<br>Russia and France.  The proposal's elements are simple: 
<br> 
<br>o       Iran would transfer a portion of its LEU 
<br>necessary for fuel production in one batch to 
<br>IAEA custody outside of Iran before the end of 
<br>the year; 
<br>o       Russia would further enrich the LEU to meet fuel 
<br>requirements; and 
<br>o       France would fabricate the fuel assemblies and 
<br>return them to Iran before Iran's fuel supplies 
<br>are depleted before the end of the year. 
<br> 
<br>-- In addition the United States expressed a commitment 
<br>to work with the IAEA to improve safety and control 
<br>features at the TRR. 
<br> 
<br>-- The U.S., France and Russia took great risks in 
<br>supporting the deal, especially in light of Iran's 
<br>continuing violation of successive UNSC resolutions and 
<br>IAEA requirements, including its secret construction of 
<br>a uranium enrichment facility near Qom, and its 
<br>continuing enrichment operations. 
<br> 
<br>-- We did so because the arrangement would begin to 
<br>build confidence and would give Iran and the 
<br>international community more time to reach a 
<br>comprehensive negotiated solution to Iran's nuclear 
<br>program, while fulfilling Iran's humanitarian needs. 
<br> 
<br>-- When Iran expressed concern about the reliability of 
<br>the proposal, the United States and its partners 
<br>expressed to the IAEA a willingness to address Iran's 
<br>concerns, including through: 
<br> 
<br>o       a U.S. offer to formally join the deal as a 
<br>signatory; 
<br> 
<br>STATE 00120288  004 OF 008 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>o       a readiness of the five permanent members of the 
<br>Security Council and Germany to guarantee the 
<br>deal through a political statement of support; 
<br>o       a willingness to help secure finance for the 
<br>movement of the LEU and fuel; 
<br>o       an openness to move the LEU to any number of 
<br>locations outside of Iran; and 
<br>o       a willingness to support the IAEA's holding 
<br>material equivalent to the fuel in escrow in a 
<br>third country as a guarantee for Iran of the 
<br>fuel's ultimate delivery. 
<br> 
<br>-- After reaching an agreement in principle in the deal 
<br>following talks with the E3+3 in Geneva on October 1, 
<br>and following further technical discussions at the IAEA 
<br>October 19-21, Iran has so far failed to accept the 
<br>deal. 
<br> 
<br>-- This raises a question about Iran's intentions.  If 
<br>Iran is enriching uranium to meet its civilian reactor 
<br>fuel needs, why would it not accept an international 
<br>offer (with significant guarantees) to provide its LEU 
<br>for fuel to power the TRR to meet its humanitarian 
<br>needs, particularly when it does not have the capability 
<br>to produce the fuel on its own? 
<br> 
<br>-- This question is troubling in the context of Iran's 
<br>continued enrichment activities in defiance of UNSC 
<br>resolutions; its secret construction of an enrichment 
<br>facility on a military base near Qom; its refusal to 
<br>cooperate with the IAEA in answering questions about the 
<br>peaceful nature of its nuclear program; and its refusal 
<br>to meet with the five permanent members of the Security 
<br>Council. 
<br> 
<br>P5+1 
<br>---- 
<br> 
<br>-- Together with our P5+1 partners, the United States 
<br>informed Iranian representatives in Geneva on October 1 
<br>of our willingness to discuss any items of concern to 
<br>Iran - both bilaterally and multilaterally - in addition 
<br>to our concerns about Iran's nuclear program. 
<br> 
<br>-- On October 1, Iran's representatives committed to 
<br>meet again before the end of the month based on an 
<br>agenda that included Iran's nuclear program.  Since that 
<br>time, however, the Iranian government has refused all 
<br>invitations to meet if its nuclear program would be on 
<br>the agenda. 
<br> 
<br>-- Iran's continued refusal to engage on its nuclear 
<br>program with the P5+1 deepens our concerns about Iran's 
<br>intentions for its nuclear program. 
<br> 
<br>The IAEA Director General's Report on Iran 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>-- The IAEA report makes clear that Iran has failed to 
<br>cooperate fully and transparently with the IAEA.  Key 
<br>aspects of the report include: 
<br> 
<br>---- Iran's new centrifuge facility at Qom - built in 
<br>violation of Iran's UNSC obligations and not declared to 
<br>the IAEA as required - has been inspected, but its 
<br>purpose and origin remain unknown.  And, Iran has not 
<br>yet cooperated with all of the IAEA's requests for 
<br>access to information and personnel.  Iran's failure to 
<br>provide the IAEA with early design information regarding 
<br>the Qom facility has been deemed "inconsistent with its 
<br>obligations under the Subsidiary Arrangements to its 
<br>Safeguards Agreement" by the IAEA.  Furthermore, the 
<br>relatively small size of the facility at Qom is 
<br>inconsistent with Iran's assertion that it is to provide 
<br>fuel for Iran's civilian reactors, raising questions 
<br>about the planned use of the Qom facility. 
<br> 
<br>---- The Agency noted that Iran's failure to declare the 
<br>Qom facility also "reduces the level of confidence in 
<br>the absence of other nuclear facilities under 
<br>construction and gives rise to questions about whether 
<br>there were any other nuclear facilities in Iran that had 
<br>not been declared to the Agency." 
<br> 
<br>---- These concerns have been compounded by the 
<br>continued pace of Iranian enrichment and steadfast 
<br>refusal to abide by the UNSC's legal requirement that 
<br>Iran suspend all such work.  Instead, Iran continues to 
<br>produce low enriched uranium and estimated its stockpile 
<br>at 1763 kilograms at the end of October. 
<br>Notwithstanding a reduction in the number of enriching 
<br>centrifuges by approximately 600 since August 2009, this 
<br>is roughly a similar rate of production as Iran has 
<br> 
<br>STATE 00120288  005 OF 008 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>achieved for the past year. 
<br> 
<br>---- Iran continues to install and test additional 
<br>centrifuges, with more than 1,000 new centrifuges added 
<br>since August 2009. 
<br> 
<br>---- The IAEA has discovered a previously unknown cache 
<br>of heavy water in storage at Esfahan, and has requested 
<br>Iran to explain its origin.  It is important to note 
<br>that UN Security Council resolutions include a ban on 
<br>supplying Iran with heavy water. 
<br> 
<br>---- It also asked Iran to provide further information 
<br>describing an analytical laboratory that Iran says it 
<br>plans to install underground at Esfahan. 
<br> 
<br>---- There has been no progress made in addressing 
<br>issues associated with Iran's efforts to develop a 
<br>nuclear warhead, despite a year having passed since the 
<br>last such conversation and many open questions that 
<br>surround this work. 
<br> 
<br>-- If Iran wishes to begin to resolve international 
<br>concerns, it should comply with its international 
<br>obligations, cooperate fully with the IAEA, grant the 
<br>access requested (such as to individuals and workshops 
<br>associated with past weaponization efforts, and to 
<br>individuals responsible for managing Qom), and answer 
<br>the questions it has been asked.  Iran has created this 
<br>confidence deficit and it is up to Iran to restore the 
<br>international community's trust. 
<br> 
<br>Next Steps 
<br>---------- 
<br> 
<br>-- The United States and its partners believe that the 
<br>troubling questions surrounding Iran's nuclear program 
<br>deserve the full and urgent attention of the 
<br>international community. 
<br> 
<br>-- We look forward to working with your government to 
<br>promote the active involvement of the IAEA and the 
<br>international community in addressing these unresolved 
<br>questions. 
<br> 
<br>-- We will be in touch with you in the days ahead to 
<br>share ideas on how to approach the issue at the IAEA 
<br>Board of Governors meeting that will begin on November 
<br>¶26. 
<br> 
<br>-- Beyond the Board of Governors meeting, we would also 
<br>like to intensify our consultations on next appropriate 
<br>steps in the international community based on the dual 
<br>track policy (engagement and pressure) to persuade Iran 
<br>to bring its nuclear program into full compliance with 
<br>its international obligations. 
<br> 
<br>HARD QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
<br>-------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (U) We have also compiled the following questions 
<br>and answers to draw from should Posts require them: 
<br> 
<br>On The TRR Proposal 
<br>------------------- 
<br> 
<br>-- Why must Iran surrender all of its LEU in one batch, 
<br>and why must it be before the end of the year? 
<br> 
<br>o       The TRR proposal was developed both to supply 
<br>Iran with the fuel required for the continued 
<br>operation of the reactor, and also as a measure 
<br>to build confidence in Iran's peaceful intentions 
<br>and its seriousness to negotiate with the E3+3. 
<br>o       By agreeing to the transfer of 1200 kilograms of 
<br>LEU (enough to equal the last fuel supply 
<br>agreement Iran signed for the reactor with 
<br>Argentina in the early 1990s), we aimed to lessen 
<br>international concerns that Iran was attempting 
<br>to create a stockpile of uranium to contribute to 
<br>an eventual breakout from the NPT.  This would 
<br>consequently allow more time for negotiations 
<br>with the E3+3 on the broader nuclear file. 
<br>o       The transfer by the end of the year is needed to 
<br>ensure that Iran receives the fuel required for 
<br>the reactor before December 2010, when the 
<br>reactor will run out and be forced to shut down. 
<br> 
<br>-- What risk does the LEU stored in Iran pose to the 
<br>international community?  Isn't it under full IAEA 
<br>monitoring? 
<br> 
<br>o       Yes, this LEU is currently under IAEA safeguards. 
<br> 
<br>STATE 00120288  006 OF 008 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>o       However, given Iran's long history of IAEA 
<br>safeguards violations and NPT noncompliance, the 
<br>international community cannot trust that Iran 
<br>will not interfere with IAEA monitoring or 
<br>withdraw from IAEA safeguards or the NPT 
<br>altogether. 
<br>o       This project will remove an immediate source of 
<br>concern and establish some confidence in Iran's 
<br>peaceful intent and willingness to comply with 
<br>its obligations. 
<br> 
<br>-- How can Iran be sure it will ever receive the fuel 
<br>assemblies for the TRR in the current international 
<br>environment, in which many openly seek to diminish 
<br>Iran's nuclear capacity? 
<br> 
<br>o       We and our E3+3 partners have each made political 
<br>commitments at the highest levels to the 
<br>fulfillment of this project.  Should Iran agree 
<br>to it, Iran will receive the fuel required. 
<br>o       All participants in this project are taking 
<br>risks.  Iran stands in violation of the NPT, its 
<br>IAEA safeguards agreement, and three Chapter VII 
<br>UNSC resolutions.  This project offers Iran an 
<br>opportunity to establish confidence in its 
<br>peaceful intentions, a confidence that has eroded 
<br>due to Iran's continued non-compliance. 
<br> 
<br>-- Can Iran simply purchase the fuel from an 
<br>international supplier, as some have advocated in Iran? 
<br>o       The UN Security Council resolutions do permit 
<br>Iran to Iran can purchase low-enriched fuel from 
<br>an international supplier if it wishes. 
<br>o       However, we are confident Iran would not find a 
<br>willing supplier given the concerns surrounding 
<br>its nuclear program and its continued defiance of 
<br>the international community. 
<br>o       Outside of the context of the IAEA proposal 
<br>before Iran, we would oppose such a deal. 
<br> 
<br>-- How would the E3+3 respond if Iran announced it had 
<br>"no choice" but to make its own fuel for the TRR? 
<br>o       Under three UN Security Council resolutions, Iran 
<br>is required to suspend all uranium enrichment- 
<br>related activities.  We have offered Iran a way 
<br>to secure the necessary TRR fuel without further 
<br>violating these obligations.  Enrichment 
<br>activities to produce its own fuel for the TRR 
<br>would be a violation of current UNSCRs. 
<br>o       Further, Iran is not currently able to produce 
<br>the fuel. Reconfiguration of Iranian centrifuges 
<br>to produce the required enrichment level (19.75%) 
<br>would cause serious international concern and 
<br>could permit Iran to produce a stockpile of even 
<br>greater enriched uranium than it has currently 
<br>(Iran's current enrichment level is 3.5%).  This 
<br>would increase the risk of a near-term Iranian 
<br>breakout from the NPT and sprint to producing 
<br>nuclear weapons. 
<br> 
<br>On Demands to Suspend Enrichment 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>-- Iran suspended enrichment once before in response to 
<br>international demands, and received no benefit.  Why 
<br>should Iran trust the international community now? 
<br> 
<br>o       Iran's suspension of uranium enrichment and other 
<br>activities in the past was intended to support a 
<br>diplomatic process.  Unfortunately, Iran 
<br>terminated that diplomatic process in August 2005 
<br>by abandoning suspension. 
<br>o       However, prior to that point, Iran's temporary 
<br>suspension avoided its being reported to the UN 
<br>Security Council and the sanctions that would 
<br>have likely come along with that report. 
<br>o       The requirement of suspension imposed by the UNSC 
<br>in resolution 1737 is intended to restore that 
<br>diplomatic process and to lead to a final 
<br>resolution of international concerns with Iran's 
<br>nuclear program. 
<br>o       This was codified in UNSCR 1737 when the UNSC 
<br>stated its intention to suspend implementation of 
<br>the measures adopted by the UNSC if Iran returned 
<br>to negotiations through suspension of its nuclear 
<br>and related activities. 
<br>o       Trust is in short supply on both sides.  It is 
<br>for that reason that we have offered Iran several 
<br>opportunities for reciprocal, confidence-building 
<br>steps (e.g., "freeze for freeze" and the TRR 
<br>proposal). 
<br> 
<br>-- What about recent reports indicating the Iranian 
<br> 
<br>STATE 00120288  007 OF 008 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>enrichment program has not grown. What is the 
<br>significance of this stagnation? 
<br> 
<br>o       Iran has slowed or scaled back the enrichment 
<br>program several times since the project became 
<br>public in 2002. 
<br>o       There are many possible explanations for the 
<br>stagnation of the Iranian enrichment program, 
<br>including technical issues with the centrifuges 
<br>and general system maintenance. 
<br>o       Regardless of Iran's lack of progress in its 
<br>enrichment program, it continues to enrich and 
<br>stockpile LEU. This activity in violation of 
<br>three United Nations Security Council resolutions 
<br>calling for full suspension of its nuclear and 
<br>enrichment related activities, and increases the 
<br>risk of a near-term Iranian breakout from the NPT 
<br>and sprint to producing nuclear weapons. 
<br> 
<br>Israel's Nuclear Program 
<br>------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>-- Why is there not equal attention to Israel's nuclear 
<br>status?  Does it not also destabilize the region? 
<br>o       The United States has long supported universal 
<br>adherence to the NPT treaty and  continues to 
<br>believe that all states that have not done so 
<br>should join the Treaty and accept the full-scope 
<br>IAEA safeguards on all of their nuclear 
<br>activities. 
<br>o       It is extremely difficult, however, to make this 
<br>case to a non-NPT state when its neighbors are in 
<br>violation of their own NPT obligations, and when 
<br>the international community has not demonstrated 
<br>the political will necessary to enforce 
<br>compliance. 
<br>o       Iran's failure to comply with its NPT and IAEA 
<br>obligations bears out these concerns and 
<br>undermines attempts to secure universal adherence 
<br>to the NPT.  It became a party to the treaty and 
<br>proceeded to violate its obligations under it for 
<br>over twenty years, presenting a fundamental 
<br>threat to the entire nonproliferation regime. 
<br>o       Returning regional states to full compliance with 
<br>their NPT obligations would be an important step 
<br>toward NPT adherence by all states in the region. 
<br>An Iranian nuclear weapons capability also serves 
<br>as a destabilizing factor in the region, possibly 
<br>triggering proliferation across the Gulf in 
<br>response to a mounting threat posed by Iran.  Not 
<br>only does this undermine the entire nuclear 
<br>nonproliferation regime, but risks further 
<br>instability in the region. 
<br> 
<br>Qom Facility 
<br>------------ 
<br> 
<br>-- How can you say that the Qom facility was secret, 
<br>when it was Iran that announced its existence and 
<br>invited IAEA inspectors to visit? 
<br> 
<br>o       Iran was required to declare the existence of 
<br>this facility to the IAEA the moment the decision 
<br>was made to construct it, not several years into 
<br>its construction.  This is a requirement of 
<br>Iran's IAEA Safeguards Agreement (contained in 
<br>Code 3.1 of the Subsidiary Arrangement to Iran's 
<br>Safeguards Agreement). 
<br>o       This code was modified after revelations 
<br>surrounding Iraq's nuclear program were made in 
<br>the early 1990s. 
<br>o       Iran was the last state to agree to the revised 
<br>code, but it did so in March 2003.  Iran 
<br>attempted to revert to the early form of the code 
<br>(which requires notification only 180 days prior 
<br>to the introduction of nuclear to the facility) 
<br>in March 2007.  The IAEA consistently has 
<br>rejected that Iran has the legal ability to make 
<br>such a change. 
<br>o       We also believe that Iran made the decision to 
<br>declare the facility not to conform to its legal 
<br>obligations, but because it had become aware that 
<br>the secrecy of the facility had been compromised. 
<br> 
<br>-- Iran claims it needs such a hardened facility as 
<br>Fordu because for years both the US and Israel have 
<br>threatened to bomb its nuclear sites. Is it not 
<br>surprising Iran would try to keep its location a secret 
<br>to have an emergency back-up facility? 
<br> 
<br>O Iran's own failure to meet its obligations for 
<br>transparency and IAEA monitoring of sensitive 
<br>nuclear installations is the cause for the 
<br> 
<br>STATE 00120288  008 OF 008 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>international community's concerns that 
<br>surrounding its nuclear program. 
<br>o       Iran's decision to construct yet another 
<br>clandestine site only deepens these concerns. 
<br> 
<br>P5+1 
<br>---- 
<br> 
<br>-- Why should Iran discuss its nuclear program with the 
<br>self-appointed P5+1?  Isn't the IAEA the proper place 
<br>for Iran to engage on its nuclear program with the 
<br>international community? 
<br> 
<br>O  We welcome Iran's engagement with the IAEA.  But 
<br>despite its rhetoric, Iran has not engaged with 
<br>the IAEA.  Iran has refused for several years to 
<br>answer the IAEA's questions (even before the IAEA 
<br>reported Iran to the UNSC for its myriad 
<br>violations of its international obligations). 
<br>o       The E3+3 mechanism evolved as a means to 
<br>negotiate a solution precisely because Iran was 
<br>refusing to engage with the IAEA on the concerns 
<br>regarding Iran's nuclear program.
