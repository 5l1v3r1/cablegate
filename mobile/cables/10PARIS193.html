<br>SUBJECT: U/S TAUSCHER'S MEETINGS WITH FRENCH OFFICIALS 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: DCM Mark Pekala, Reasons 1.4 (b), (d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C/NF) SUMMARY: Under Secretary of State for Arms Control 
<br>and International Security Ellen Tauscher's February 2 
<br>meetings with French counterparts from the Elysee 
<br>(presidency) and MFA included discussions of U.S. disarmament 
<br>priorities, the NPT Review Conference (NPT RevCon), the 
<br>Nuclear Security Summit, and missile defense.  Meeting 
<br>separately with NSA-equivalent Jean-David Levitte, Presidency 
<br>Strategic Affairs Advisor Francois Richier, and MFA Strategic 
<br>Affairs Director Patrick Maisonnave, U/S Tauscher reassured 
<br>the French that while "a world without nuclear weapons" is a 
<br>sincere USG ambition, the United States will not move 
<br>precipitously and will take allies' interests into account. 
<br>U/S Tauscher discussed next steps on NPT RevCon preparations, 
<br>including thinking creatively about outcomes and minimizing 
<br>the threat of disruptive Egyptian behavior.  U/S Tauscher 
<br>also clarified USG missile defense priorities, especially 
<br>political support for territorial defense at the 2010 Lisbon 
<br>NATO summit. END SUMMARY. 
<br> 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br>MOVING FORWARD ON DISARMAMENT 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) U/S Tauscher stressed to Levitte, Richier, and 
<br>Maisonnave that the U.S. position on disarmament is not far 
<br>from that of France.  President Obama's ambition for a world 
<br>without nuclear weapons is sincere, but grounded in reality, 
<br>and the United States will not act precipitously or 
<br>jeopardize core French interests or our relationship.  U/S 
<br>Tauscher added that disarmament language in coming 
<br>international forums, such as the April Nuclear Security 
<br>Summit and the May Review Conference for the Nuclear 
<br>Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT RevCon), is important to the 
<br>United States.  However, the United States also wants a 
<br>strong focus on non-proliferation.  Tauscher stressed that 
<br>the USG wanted to work with France to strike the right 
<br>balance between disarmament and nonproliferation.  The United 
<br>States remains committed to an effective deterrent, and the 
<br>President's recent budget proposal includes a significant 
<br>increase for the maintaining of U.S. nuclear forces. 
<br>Additionally, the forthcoming Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) 
<br>will strengthen extended deterrence, focusing on the quality 
<br>of the deterrent force rather than quantity. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S/NF) Expressing relief at the USG commitment to 
<br>coordination with France, Richier and Maisonnave nevertheless 
<br>both stressed the French commitment to its nuclear deterrent, 
<br>and Richier said the French worry that any unwelcome changes 
<br>to U.S. declaratory policy in the NPR could signal a U.S. 
<br>intention to insert the same policies into the NATO Strategic 
<br>Concept.  Richier noted that any such attempt could impact 
<br>France's ability to integrate its nuclear forces into NATO. 
<br>In such a situation they would have to declare their 
<br>strategic forces totally independent.  U/S Tauscher responded 
<br>that the French would not be surprised by the NPR because 
<br>consultation would be ongoing, adding that the United States 
<br>has no intention of acting unilaterally on nuclear issues in 
<br>the NATO context.  Richier noted that France was working on a 
<br>paper that looks at its nuclear policy.  As a result of their 
<br>review, the GOF has concluded that their criteria for use are 
<br>very limited. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (S/NF) Levitte asked when the administration was planning 
<br>on pushing for ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban 
<br>Treaty (CTBT), as U.S. ratification would be key to Chinese 
<br>ratification, the true French goal.  U/S Tauscher said that 
<br>getting the post-START treaty ratified would be a first 
<br>priority, but that discussions of CTBT would start soon, 
<br>including an upcoming report by the National Academy of 
<br>Sciences.  Levitte stated that only when the U.S. ratifies 
<br>the CTBT will it be possible to put real pressure on the 
<br>Chinese.  On a fissile material cutoff treaty (FMCT), Richier 
<br>said the French have "reason to believe" that China has been 
<br>pushing Pakistan to keep up its opposition to starting 
<br>negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament, adding that 
<br>Pakistan does not seem to care that it is isolated. 
<br> 
<br>----------------------- 
<br>NUCLEAR SECURITY SUMMIT 
<br>----------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (SBU) Richier and Maisonnave both reiterated France's 
<br>position that the April Nuclear Security Summit in Washington 
<br>should address radiological threats in addition to nuclear 
<br>material.  They also expressed GOF opposition to language in 
<br>the draft communique calling for a "world without nuclear 
<br> 
<br>PARIS 00000193  002 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>weapons."  U/S Tauscher suggested that while the United 
<br>States would insist on having disarmament language in the 
<br>communique, the formulation agreed to in the G8 statement 
<br>from the July 2009 L'Aquila summit may allow consensus. 
<br>(NOTE: "We are...committed to...creating the conditions for a 
<br>world without nuclear weapons, in accordance with the goals 
<br>of the NPT". END NOTE.)  Richier and Maisonnave agreed that 
<br>France could accept this language.  They did note their 
<br>concern that it may be difficult for all 44 countries invited 
<br>to the Nuclear Security Summit to agree to this language, 
<br>since some are not NPT members. 
<br> 
<br>---------- 
<br>NPT REVCON 
<br>---------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (S/NF) Richier and Maisonnave agreed with U/S Tauscher's 
<br>analysis that Egyptian FM Aboul-Gheit will, if unchecked, 
<br>work to undermine the RevCon with an aggressive posture on 
<br>the Middle East Nuclear Weapons Free Zone (NWFZ) resolution. 
<br>U/S Tauscher outlined ongoing U.S. efforts to gain consensus 
<br>language on the NWFZ, but underlined the need to contemplate 
<br>a more forward-leaning strategy.  She suggested considering 
<br>possible phone calls from Presidents Obama and Sarkozy 
<br>directly to Egyptian President Mubarak in the mid-March 
<br>timeframe to sensitize the Egyptian president to the 
<br>importance of the RevCon in strengthening the NPT and the 
<br>unhelpful role the Egyptian MFA is playing.  The French 
<br>agreed on the likely need to elevate the issue beyond 
<br>Aboul-Gheit.  In this context, U/S Tauscher also brainstormed 
<br>with the French on a final "package deal" that could be 
<br>offered to the Egyptians, including new consensus language on 
<br>a NWFZ, a conference on civilian nuclear power in the Middle 
<br>East, and/or pushing Israel to accept CTBT. (NOTE: The latter 
<br>two were uncleared, spontaneous French suggestions. END 
<br>NOTE.)  U/S Tauscher said that, if Egypt is still not willing 
<br>to budge, it may be worth finding other Non-Aligned Movement 
<br>states that could be separated from Egypt with promises of 
<br>assistance that Egypt would no longer receive. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) Levitte said that progress on Middle East peace prior 
<br>to the RevCon would help greatly in creating a constructive 
<br>atmosphere, adding that he would pursue discussions on this 
<br>linkage at the February 5-7 Munich Security Conference. 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (C) Richier suggested that, in the absence of an 
<br>acceptable and substantive final document, it may be possible 
<br>to capitalize on other events prior to the RevCon, including 
<br>the September UN Security Council summit, the Nuclear 
<br>Security Summit, and the March OECD-hosted civilian nuclear 
<br>energy conference in Paris.  Richier said it may be worth 
<br>looking into how to repackage the positive results achieved 
<br>or expected at these events in a statement or document at the 
<br>RevCon that acknowledges their importance in strengthening 
<br>the NPT. 
<br> 
<br>---- 
<br>IRAN 
<br>---- 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C) Levitte said that the French ambassador in Tehran 
<br>believes that there is a growing split between the population 
<br>and the regime that may be irreparable.  The Iranian 
<br>population thinks that action against the regime by the 
<br>international community is good and France believes that it 
<br>is important to support publicly those protesters taking to 
<br>the street.  Levitte noted that he had talked to Iranian 
<br>Foreign Minister Mottaki in Davos, Switzerland, in an attempt 
<br>to get the Iranians to accept the Tehran Research Reactor 
<br>Deal.  Mottaki stated that Iran had "new ideas" but did not 
<br>provide any details.  Levitte stated that Iran was counting 
<br>on tension between Washington and Beijing. 
<br> 
<br>--------------- 
<br>MISSILE DEFENSE 
<br>--------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (C/NF) Levitte said the GOF is in the early stages of an 
<br>interagency review on missile defense (MD).  According to 
<br>him, the "old guard" sees MD as a threat to France's nuclear 
<br>deterrent, but he added that President Sarkozy has publicly 
<br>stated that MD is in fact a welcome complement to deterrence. 
<br> France has no money for a NATO system, but would be happy to 
<br>contribute specific capabilities.  He added that President 
<br>Sarkozy would not see specific proposals on the way forward 
<br>for several weeks.  Richier added that the more details the 
<br>United States can provide on its own plans, the easier it is 
<br>to "arbitrate between different factions" in the French 
<br> 
<br>PARIS 00000193  003 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>government.  In the NATO context, Maisonnave's deputy and 
<br>NATO specialist Muriel Domenach said France's concerns about 
<br>funding required for MD were amplified by its judgment that 
<br>the costs for programs approved for common funding inevitably 
<br>seem to rise after approval is given. 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (C) U/S Tauscher and DAS Frank Rose clarified that the 
<br>U.S. Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) was the U.S. national 
<br>contribution to a NATO system, and that the USG would provide 
<br>all funding.  U/S Tauscher stressed that the main U.S. 
<br>priority was to gain political support at the head of state 
<br>level for making territorial MD a NATO mission at the 2010 
<br>NATO summit in Lisbon.  Tauscher noted that the United States 
<br>wants NATO's Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense 
<br>(ALTBMD) to provide the backbone to the Phased Adaptive 
<br>Approach but that we would not make the Lisbon Summit a 
<br>donors' conference. 
<br> 
<br>------------ 
<br>OTHER ISSUES 
<br>------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (C) On the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) 
<br>Treaty, Maisonnave noted that the French government believes 
<br>that the Treaty is dead.  But, paradoxically, everyone 
<br>believes it is a good treaty and there is no consensus on how 
<br>to move forward.  Germany, for example, does not believe it 
<br>is dead.  The French believe that it would be better to take 
<br>a Vienna Document-type approach to achieve some of the 
<br>objectives of the CFE Treaty. 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (C) Both Richier and Maisonnave raised the issue of the 
<br>EC-151 Eurocopter.  Richier noted that France classified it 
<br>as a civilian helicopter.  The French were concerned that the 
<br>U.S. review on this issue continued to be postponed.  U/S 
<br>Tauscher agreed to look into this matter.  She noted that a 
<br>visit to the French factory was to occur soon and promised to 
<br>get back to the French as soon as possible.
