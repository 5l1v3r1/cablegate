<br>SUBJECT: MEXICO: PROMISING FIRST TALKS WITH SEDENA ON HUMAN 
<br>RIGHTS 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Gustavo Delgado. 
<br>Reason: 1.4 (b),(d) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (c) Summary: DATT, ODC Chief, DOJ Attache and Pol MinCouns 
<br>met with officials from the National Defense Secretariat 
<br>(SEDENA) on September 7 to discuss initiating a human rights 
<br>dialogue with the Mexican military that would allow us to 
<br>understand the legal process in the Mexican system of 
<br>military justice and clarify specific questions with regards 
<br>to alleged violations. General Lopez Portillo, the Senior 
<br>Human Rights official in SEDENA and a veteran military 
<br>prosecutor, was the lead official on the Mexican side, 
<br>accompanied by a Director General level representative from 
<br>the Mexican Foreign Ministry (SRE). They welcomed the 
<br>beginning of a dialogue with the Embassy on human rights 
<br>matters and proposed regular senior formal meetings (he 
<br>suggested 2-3 a year) as well as working level discussions to 
<br>clarify specific cases. (A list of all participants is 
<br>provided in para 7). 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br>Willing to Talk but a Dialogue Will Take Work 
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (c) Although we previously had provided a list of specific 
<br>questions on several cases involving alleged human rights 
<br>violations through official SEDENA and SRE channels, and our 
<br>meeting had been coordinated a month in advance through the 
<br>SEDENA Protocol office (S2), Lopez Portillo did not receive 
<br>our questions before the meeting. This was not an indication 
<br>of SEDENA's unwillingness to discuss the cases, but rather 
<br>reflects a lack of experience in engaging on the human rights 
<br>topic and their somewhat rigid rules for transmitting 
<br>information to and within the SEDENA bureaucracy. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (c) Unaware of the questions we had provided on 
<br>allegations related to the specific cases, General Lopez 
<br>Portillo organized a general and open agenda for the meeting, 
<br>aimed at facilitating an open and frank discussion on 
<br>internal legal and judicial procedures within the Mexican 
<br>military. Throughout the meeting, our Mexican interlocutors 
<br>were well-disposed to answering our questions and 
<br>establishing a collaborative dialogue. We noted our interest 
<br>in reviewing the details of some specific cases as part of an 
<br>ongoing dialogue on human rights issues that would allow us 
<br>to understand better how SEDENA and the Mexican legal system 
<br>handled crimes involving military personnel and civilians. We 
<br>provided a copy of the questions we had provided prior to the 
<br>meeting and suggested a follow-up meeting to go over the 
<br>cases in more detail. 
<br>
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br>SEDENA AND SRE SUGGEST A WAY FORWARD 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶4. (c) SRE Director General for Human Rights and Democracy 
<br>Alejandro Negrin agreed with Lopez Portillo that we should 
<br>establish a formal and regular dialogue to discuss both the 
<br>specific cases and larger framework of how the Mexican 
<br>judicial system works in response to crimes involving 
<br>military personnel and civilians. He noted relevant legal 
<br>reforms and the ongoing effort by SEDENA to clarify its 
<br>procedures and respond to responsible questions. Lopez 
<br>Portillo noted SEDENA's interest in continuing to do more in 
<br>this regard and was supportive of establishing a bi-lateral 
<br>mechanism that would allow us to work together to help 
<br>clarify allegations. He suggested formal senior level 
<br>meetings several times a year, with working level meetings in 
<br>between. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (c) Lopez Portillo promised a timely written response to 
<br>the written questions we had provided earlier. He also 
<br>undertook to set up meetings to review military legal 
<br>procedure, particularly with regard to crimes involving 
<br>military and civilians. He suggested that we work closely 
<br>and collaboratively to clarify procedures and outstanding 
<br>allegations, many of which he observed, were designed to cast 
<br>doubt and dispersion on the Mexican military and not to 
<br>establish the truth. Both sides agreed that new questions 
<br>
<br>MEXICO 00002676 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>about additional cases in the future should be provided 
<br>through SRE channels with a courtesy copy given to SEDENA. 
<br>The official response to specific cases would be delivered 
<br>from SEDENA through the SRE. Lopez Portillo said that he was 
<br>eager to work together with us to ensure that there would be 
<br>a satisfactory response on all human rights allegations. 
<br>
<br>------- 
<br>COMMENT 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (c) Establishing a productive human rights dialogue with 
<br>the Mexican military will take some work and considerable 
<br>fine tuning. This is not an area that the Mexican military 
<br>has traditionally discussed with any outsiders. While the 
<br>Mexican military has made some progress in establishing 
<br>mechanisms to review human rights allegations in response to 
<br>internal constitutional reforms and Mexico's international 
<br>obligations, it is still a delicate subject and one they are 
<br>likely to manage cautiously and not always adroitly. We are 
<br>encouraged by our initial meeting but much remains to be 
<br>done. We will follow up promptly with SEDENA and SRE to set 
<br>up our next meeting. Lopez Portillo provided repeated 
<br>assurances that SEDENA is prepared to respond in writing -- 
<br>supplemented by working level discussion to clarify any 
<br>questions of procedure and translation -- to our questions on 
<br>specific cases. We will also expand current training and 
<br>subject matter expert exchanges that could help provide 
<br>SEDENA with support in their efforts to address human rights 
<br>issues in a more comprehensive and transparent way.
