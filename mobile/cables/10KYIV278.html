<br>SUBJECT: FORMER TYMOSHENKO INSIDER CALLS HER DESTRUCTIVE,
<br>WANTS HER OUT OF POWER
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador John F. Tefft for Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary. In a damning indictment of Prime Minster
<br>Yuliya Tymoshenko and her lack of leadership, respected
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx argued that Tymoshenko
<br>would continue to work against reform. To limit her
<br>destructiveness, xxxxxxxxxxxx argued for early parliamentary
<br>elections, which would help strengthen new leaders such as
<br>Tihipko and Yatsenyuk. He also expressed hope that the
<br>International Monetary Fund (IMF) would strictly hold Ukraine
<br>to its commitments to implement reform. xxxxxxxxxxxx appeared to
<br>deliver his message not in anger, but in sincere sorrow for
<br>the country and frustration at his inability to convince
<br>Tymoshenko to take advantage of the opportunity presented by
<br>the economic crisis for reform. Instead, xxxxxxxxxxxx said
<br>Tymoshenko wasted the opportunity in favor of populism and a
<br>simple desire for all-embracing power. End Summary.
<br>
<br>----------------------------------
<br>Tymoshenko: Power-hungry Populist
<br>----------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) During a meeting with the Ambassador on xxxxxxxxxxxx,
<br>accused Prime Minister Tymoshenko of wasting the opportunity
<br>for reform that came with the economic crisis. He believed
<br>that Tymoshenko would continue to work against reform, and
<br>that her argument would be that she and her government were
<br>able to make all domestic and international payments during
<br>the crisis without implementing what would amount to painful
<br>reforms for the public. In this sense, xxxxxxxxxxxx said the IMF
<br>program had actually harmed Ukraine. Neither the Ukrainian
<br>government nor the public suffered terribly from the crisis
<br>thanks to IMF money. As a result, support for change that
<br>would pull the economy out of crisis evaporated.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx said that it was an easy decision for
<br>Tymoshenko to do nothing to reform the economy. He was
<br>critical of her leadership skills and said that she made
<br>policy decisions without listening to considered advice. He
<br>found it difficult to understand Tymoshenko,s logic most of
<br>the time, except in the sense that her decisions were
<br>normally guided by &adventurous populism.8 She also was
<br>overly confident in her own decisions and believed everyone
<br>else is wrong. xxxxxxxxxxxx concluded that Tymoshenko simply
<br>wanted to consolidate power in her own hands. In her eyes,
<br>populism helped her do this; reform would not.xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>own frustration with his inability to influence policy xxxxxxxxxxxx.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----
<br>Pre-term Parliamentary Elections Best for Country
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx was certain that Tymoshenko would continue
<br>to act as a destructive force in &hard-core8 opposition to
<br>Yanukovych. As a result, he argued that pre-term
<br>parliamentary elections would be best for the country. He
<br>assumed BYuT and Our Ukraine would lose seats in Parliament
<br>with a pre-term election. It would also allow new voices,
<br>such as Serhiy Tihipko and Arseniy Yatsenyuk, to gain a
<br>stronger position. xxxxxxxxxxxx thought that the voters in the
<br>presidential election had shown that they wanted new leaders
<br>to come to power.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Although elections would delay reform for a few more
<br>months, xxxxxxxxxxxx thought a new parliament would be more
<br>likely to implement reform. He understood that this could
<br>delay the return of the IMF to Ukraine; but, xxxxxxxxxxxx argued
<br>that the country could get through the next six months on its
<br>reserves, particularly if no new budget were adopted. The
<br>lack of a budget limited the government,s ability to spend,
<br>he said. In fact, xxxxxxxxxxxx argued that pushing the country
<br>into a deeper crisis could actually be a benefit because
<br>voters and the leaders would feel the need for change more
<br>acutely.

<br>----------------------------------
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx Prescription For Reform
<br>----------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx argued that in the 1990s and in 2000, when
<br>the economy was truly in crisis, Ukraine had made some
<br>positive changes that led to growth. Ukraine again had a
<br>unique opportunity to reform the structure of the government
<br>itself, to tackle corruption, and to implement economic
<br>reform that would put the country back on the path to growth.
<br>He agreed with the conditions contained in the IMF package
<br>for Ukraine, including gas price increases and pension
<br>reform, but said that the IMF should be stricter in forcing
<br>adherence. xxxxxxxxxxxx passed the Ambassador two documents,
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx, outlining his reform priorities. The papers are
<br>copied below, paras 8 and 9.

<br>Comment
<br>---------
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx appeared to deliver his message not in anger,
<br>but in sorrow for the country and in frustration at his
<br>inability to convince Tymoshenko to take advantage of the
<br>opportunity presented by the economic crisis for reform. His
<br>indictment of Tymoshenko was particularly damning xxxxxxxxxxxx,
<br>one of the few we have
<br>found in high-levels of government in Ukraine. It is
<br>unfortunate that Tymoshenko,s unwillingness to make the hard
<br>decisions has cost the country dearly, not only in terms of
<br>larger deficits, greater public debt, and declining GDP, but
<br>also in that she has driven out intelligent, xxxxxxxxxxxx.
<br>
<br>----------------------
<br>Preventative Measures
<br>----------------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (U) Unofficial translation of xxxxxxxxxxxx ten preventative
<br>measures for Ukraine.
<br>
<br>¶A. Government reform (functional structure). Eliminate
<br>six ministries; subordinate other government bodies to the
<br>ministries.
<br>¶B. Increase the pension age: two years up for men; 3
<br>years up for women. Cancel the right of early retirement and
<br>length of service calculation when one year is counted as
<br>two. (Note: For every year of work, workers in hazardous
<br>sectors -- such as steel workers and miners -- receive credit
<br>for two years worked. AT the end of 20 years at work, for
<br>example, miners' pensions are calculated on the basis of
<br>having worked 40 years.)
<br>¶C. Limit pensions for working pensioners.
<br>¶D. Cancel special pensions -- these were distributed to
<br>high-level government officials, judges, scientists, or
<br>managers at state-owned firms and are higher than normal
<br>pensions.
<br>¶E. Double gas prices for public consumption. Increase gas
<br>prices 50% for consumption by municipal heating companies.
<br>Increase electricity prices by 40%.
<br>¶F. Grant the authority to set prices to public service
<br>providers (for 2 years); increase service prices
<br>simultaneously with gas prices.
<br>¶G. Cancel the legislative provision banning communal
<br>service providers from cutting off or fining consumers for
<br>non-payment of communal services.
<br>¶H. Increase excise duty for petrol by EUR 60 (Note: Not
<br>clear on what volume. end note.) Cancel preferential rates,
<br>increase vehicle owner taxes by 50%.
<br>¶I. Keep the minimum subsistence-level payment unchanged
<br>but introduce extra payments for the needy.
<br>¶J. Bind privileges and social payments to incomes: if
<br>incomes are high, privileges and social payments will be
<br>lower.
