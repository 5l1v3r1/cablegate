<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Craig Stapleton for reasons 1.4 (B & D). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: Foreign policy played only a negligible 
<br>role in the presidential election campaign that concluded May 
<br>6, and Sarkozy has relatively little experience in foreign 
<br>affairs, despite his tenures as Interior and Finance 
<br>Minister. Nonetheless, Sarkozy's personality is such that he 
<br>will want to take the stage at the June 6-8 G8 and June 21-22 
<br>European summits as a full partner. Instinctively 
<br>pro-American and pro-Israeli, Sarkozy is fiercely opposed to 
<br>Turkish EU membership. He has promised that his approach to 
<br>foreign affairs will be different from Chirac's in its 
<br>emphasis on human rights, and has identified Europe, Africa 
<br>and the U.S. as his three immediate priorities. That said, 
<br>generally speaking, continuity will prevail, reflecting the 
<br>non-partisan, consensus support that French foreign policy 
<br>has enjoyed during the Fifth Republic. On Europe, his goal 
<br>is, by overcoming the current institutional crisis, to 
<br>re-impart momentum to European integration and make the EU a 
<br>major player on the world stage. On Africa, Sarkozy 
<br>advocates increased developmental aid as the offset for 
<br>regulating immigration (important for his domestic agenda) 
<br>and has repeatedly called for action on Darfur. He has 
<br>called for a "Mediterranean Union," to include Turkey and 
<br>Israel, as Europe's institutional link to the Middle East and 
<br>North Africa. With the U.S., he seeks a relationship based 
<br>on renewed confidence and trust that still allows for honest 
<br>differences of perspective; most recently, he has pointed to 
<br>global climate change (septel) as his major area of policy 
<br>difference with the U.S. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) SUMMARY CONT'D: The Deputy Secretary's May 16 
<br>meetings in Paris will occur the same day President-elect 
<br>Sarkozy assumes office (Sarkozy himself will therefore be 
<br>unavailable). Beyond welcoming the prospect of improved 
<br>U.S.-French relations, the Deputy Secretary can use his visit 
<br>to send a message on five key U.S. foreign policy concerns. 
<br>We can welcome Sarkozy's willingness to take a tough line on 
<br>Iran, but also will need to impress on him the stakes in 
<br>Afghanistan and the importance of France remaining a key 
<br>partner there. On Iraq, we can expect Sarkozy to drop the 
<br>needling rhetoric on a horizon for U.S. withdrawal, but 
<br>having told the President he "wants to help the U.S. get out 
<br>of Iraq," we should press him to offer a specific, symbolic 
<br>proposal -- such as active French engagement with friendly 
<br>Arab governments -- to associate France with our efforts 
<br>there. In assuring Sarkozy of strong U.S. support for a 
<br>strong Europe, we need to stress the importance we attach to 
<br>keeping Turkey's EU accession negotiations going. Finally, 
<br>we should stress the importance of a united front against 
<br>Russia as Kosovo goes before the UNSC. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>A NOVICE IN FOREIGN POLICY 
<br>-------------------------- 
<br>¶3. (C) A presidential election campaign dominated by the 
<br>domestic change and reform thematic left very little room for 
<br>foreign policy. Sarkozy has little foreign policy experience 
<br>and speaks only very limited English. Given his strong 
<br>character and action-oriented agenda, and his desire to put 
<br>France back on center stage, we can nonetheless expect 
<br>Sarkozy to move quickly to assert himself as an equal partner 
<br>at the upcoming June 6-8 G8 Summit in Germany and the June 
<br>21-22 European Council meeting in Brussels. (See ref A for a 
<br>discussion of Sarkozy's views on economic and trade issues.) 
<br>
<br>U.S.-FRIENDLIER, BUT STILL A GAULLIST 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br>¶4. (C) Most voters went to the polls May 6 convinced that 
<br>President-elect Sarkozy would seek a better relationship with 
<br>the U.S., which he explicitly affirmed in his May 6 
<br>acceptance speech. Sarkozy's opponents had attempted to use 
<br>his September 12, 2006 meeting with President Bush to suggest 
<br>that Sarkozy was a U.S. "poodle" who would have supported the 
<br>U.S. intervention in Iraq, unlike President Chirac. In a 
<br>recent press conference on foreign policy (ref B), Sarkozy 
<br>made clear he had supported Chirac's decision. Then and in 
<br>his post-election remarks, he nonetheless highlighted the 
<br>need for a friendlier tone and more confidence in the 
<br>U.S.-French bilateral relationship (and in NATO-EU 
<br>relations), in a way that also preserves Gaullist (and EU) 
<br>freedom of action. In effect, Sarkozy has already shifted 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00001844 002 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>the focus of U.S.-French "differences" from Iraq and the 
<br>Israeli-Palestinian relationship to climate change and 
<br>Turkish membership in the EU (see also refs B, C and D). 
<br>
<br>EU TOP IMMEDIATE PRIORITY 
<br>------------------------- 
<br>¶5. (C) Sarkozy's first foreign policy priority will be to 
<br>impart new momentum to the EU and show that France is back as 
<br>a key EU player. Sarkozy no doubt knows already that his 
<br>idea of a simplified treaty is acceptable to London and 
<br>Berlin as the best means to avoid new referenda, and he will 
<br>move quickly to ensure that a process can begin by the end of 
<br>the German EU Presidency that would conclude at the latest by 
<br>the end of the French Presidency in December 2008, in advance 
<br>of European parliamentary elections in early 2009. Immediate 
<br>progress on this front would go a long way to overcome the 
<br>sense of malaise and indirection stemming from President 
<br>Chirac's failure to push through the referendum on the 
<br>Constitutional Treaty in May 2005. Sarkozy wants a European 
<br>Union that is a veritable player on the world stage, with 
<br>coherent policies to guarantee its energy supplies and create 
<br>buffers against globalization while harnessing its creative 
<br>energies. 
<br>
<br>AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT AND DARFUR 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br>¶6. (c) Sarkozy lacks the web of personal relationships with 
<br>African (and Middle Eastern) leaders that, in particular, 
<br>Chirac used to direct French foreign policy. Sarkozy intends 
<br>to make a virtue of his less personalized approach, reviewing 
<br>France's exposure based on a hard-headed re-evaluation of 
<br>French national interests. Sarkozy has identified Africa as 
<br>one of his three foreign policy priority areas (along with 
<br>the EU and U.S.), in line with his domestic campaign focus on 
<br>uncontrolled immigration to France. His interest in 
<br>development assistance for Africa appears aimed primarily at 
<br>offsetting Africans' concern over Sarkozy's domestic 
<br>political goal of reducing immigration from Africa -- and as 
<br>part of a more comprehensive international effort to address 
<br>conditions in Africa that give rise to mass emigration from 
<br>the continent. A review of French national interests may 
<br>augur a lessening of French military engagement across Africa 
<br>or an increased desire to see the EU take over some of its 
<br>missions. Sarkozy has called repeatedly for action on 
<br>Darfur, including prosecution of Sudanese leaders by the 
<br>International Criminal Court, but it is unclear at this stage 
<br>what concrete steps he might otherwise propose. 
<br>
<br>MEDITERRANEAN UNION AND THE MIDDLE EAST 
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br>¶7. (C) We can expect Sarkozy to push hard his signature 
<br>"vision" issue, the idea of a "Mediterranean Union," to 
<br>include Turkey and Israel, which would supersede the EU 
<br>Barcelona process and create an area modeled after, and 
<br>having a privileged partnership with, the European Union. 
<br>Sarkozy has bluntly declared that pursuing Middle East peace 
<br>is not incompatible with ensuring Israel's security, while 
<br>assuring nervous Arab leaders -- most recently Egyptian 
<br>President Mubarak -- that his policies toward the Middle East 
<br>would be largely in synch with Chirac's. On the whole, it 
<br>seems likely that continuity will prevail, although the 
<br>traditionally pro-Arab MFA may have to accommodate Sarkozy's 
<br>greater emphasis on Israel's security needs. It remains to 
<br>be seen to what extent Sarkozy will attempt to leverage his 
<br>pro-Israel orientation for more leverage for France and/or 
<br>the EU in the Middle East peace process. 
<br>
<br>MORE HUMAN RIGHTS 
<br>----------------- 
<br>¶8. (C) Sarkozy has indicated very publicly -- enough so that 
<br>it is reasonable to assume that he will follow through -- 
<br>that he intends to place more emphasis on human rights 
<br>issues. He has made clear that he would be less likely than 
<br>Chirac to accommodate even Russia or China in the name of 
<br>realpolitik, citing the situation in Chechnya and his 
<br>opposition to lifting of the EU arms embargo on China. A 
<br>consistent emphasis on human rights could have a significant 
<br>impact on French policy in Africa and the Middle East. 
<br>
<br>IMMEDIATE MESSAGES: IRAN, IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN, 
<br>EU/TURKEY, KOSOVO/RUSSIA 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br>¶9. (C) We believe that, beginning with the May 15-16 visit 
<br>to France of the Deputy Secretary, the USG should reach out 
<br>quickly to engage the new French government. Beyond 
<br>welcoming prospects for an improved U.S.-French relationship, 
<br>we need to send messages on the following five key issues: 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00001844 003 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, EU/Turkey, and Kosovo/Russia. If 
<br>time permits, the Deputy Secretary may also wish to review 
<br>the state of play on Darfur. 
<br>
<br>-- IRAN: Sarkozy views Iran as the most serious 
<br>international threat, and he will be at least as tough-minded 
<br>a partner as Chirac has been. He has expressed a willingness 
<br>to tighten financial sanctions against Iran. While he 
<br>prefers acting under the authority of the UNSC, we believe he 
<br>could support resorting to measures outside the UN framework 
<br>if necessary. The late-May consideration of next steps in 
<br>the UNSC offers a first opportunity to work with the new 
<br>government, and to test and shape its approach. 
<br>
<br>-- AFGHANISTAN: MFA Political Director Araud has underscored 
<br>the need for the USG to engage the new government to dispel 
<br>the widespread impression, shared by Chirac, that Afghanistan 
<br>may be a losing cause. Under the impact of the Taliban 
<br>kidnapping of French citizens, Sarkozy recently stated that 
<br>France's role in Afghanistan -- now that the anti-terrorism 
<br>campaign has largely ended and French Special Forces 
<br>withdrawn from OEF -- was no longer "decisive" and that 
<br>French forces would not remain there permanently. The 
<br>Taliban threat against the life of the one remaining French 
<br>hostage is still directly tied to a demand for France's 
<br>military withdrawal form Afghanistan. We will need to 
<br>impress on Sarkozy the importance of French perseverance over 
<br>the mid-term (including through more purposeful public 
<br>statements about the stakes there) and, as the French have 
<br>stressed to us on Bosnia or Kosovo, the importance of "in 
<br>together and out together," which also applies to national 
<br>caveats on the use of forces. 
<br>
<br>-- IRAQ: Chirac's departure from the scene should enable 
<br>France to put U.S.-French differences not only aside, but 
<br>behind us. Sarkozy, like most other French politicians, has 
<br>said he would have handled our differences in a less 
<br>confrontational matter. This does not change the fact that 
<br>he (now, in any case) believes Chirac made the right decision 
<br>in opposing the war. Moreover, concern about feeding the 
<br>"President Bush's poodle" accusation might militate against 
<br>any dramatic public change in GOF policy, at least in the 
<br>immediate future, with French parliamentary elections 
<br>looming. That said, we should take him at his word that he 
<br>"wants to help the U.S. get out of Iraq." Our goal in the 
<br>near term should be to push the French toward a more positive 
<br>declaratory policy, working with the new government to 
<br>identify a symbolic turning of the page on France's "let the 
<br>U.S. live with it" attitude of the Chirac/Villepin years. 
<br>One possibility would be active French engagement on Iraq 
<br>with Arab governments of the region. 
<br>
<br>-- EU/TURKEY: Publicly and privately, we should encourage 
<br>France to reassume its rightful place in Europe, as part of 
<br>our broader message that a re-invigorated Europe is in the 
<br>U.S. interest. If we decide to participate in an ESDP police 
<br>mission in Kosovo, we should use this as an example -- one 
<br>for them to follow -- of choosing the institutional framework 
<br>for joint action to match the needs of the situation. Luc 
<br>Ferry, a former Education Minister, political commentator and 
<br>close friend of Sarkozy's, has urged that we attempt to 
<br>change Sarkozy's opposition to Turkey's EU membership. While 
<br>a change of heart appears extremely unlikely given Sarkozy's 
<br>political identification with opposition to Turkish 
<br>membership and his categorical statements on the issue, we 
<br>should seek to persuade him to temper his post-election 
<br>rhetoric, allow accession negotiations to proceed, and at 
<br>least not close the door dramatically and completely at this 
<br>time. 
<br>
<br>-- KOSOVO/RUSSIA: We should stress the importance of a 
<br>united front in the UN Security Council on Kosovo's 
<br>independence. We would welcome a more active French role in 
<br>persuading Russia not to veto a UNSC Resolution. 
<br>
<br>ENGAGING THE SARKOZY ADMINISTRATION 
<br>----------------------------------- 
<br>¶10. (C) We will know more about the likely foreign policy 
<br>orientations of the new Sarkozy government once he names a 
<br>foreign minister and key advisors are in place. We would 
<br>expect him to designate someone of proven competence (such as 
<br>former FM Alain Juppe, Defense Minister Michele Alliot-Marie, 
<br>or former FM Michel Barnier). There is no reason to believe 
<br>that Sarkozy will come into office with the intent of 
<br>seriously challenging the Gaullist consensus underlying 
<br>French foreign policy. The MFA will work overtime to ensure 
<br>continuity in French policy positions. Over time, and as he 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00001844 004 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>gains experience, Sarkozy is certain to assert his authority 
<br>over foreign policy more directly. It still remains to be 
<br>seen whether Sarkozy will create -- as proposed by Pierre 
<br>Lellouche -- the French equivalent of a National Security 
<br>Council that would supplant the Presidential diplomatic cell 
<br>and assume a larger role in coordinating French foreign 
<br>policy; we have no indication Sarkozy has personally signed 
<br>on to such a move. It is also unclear whether the 
<br>Presidency's Africa Cell, which has long enjoyed a privileged 
<br>position, will survive in its present form. Sarkozy's desire 
<br>to move away from Elysee-centered personal diplomacy with 
<br>African leaders may mean the days of this bureaucratic 
<br>post-colonial throwback may be numbered. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Although Sarkozy will initially be focused on 
<br>domestic reforms and relaunching the EU, he will also grasp 
<br>every opportunity to showcase his leadership of a 
<br>re-invigorated France on the international scene, confident 
<br>of its place in the world. This entails -- and he will not 
<br>be shy about repeating this point publicly -- establishing a 
<br>relationship of trust and working together productively with 
<br>the United States. The Deputy Secretary's May 15-16 visit 
<br>will offer the first occasion to make our views known to the 
<br>new Administration, as it comes into office (unfortunately, 
<br>this also means that Sarkozy himself will be unavailable for 
<br>meetings). The Defense Secretary's June 5-6 visit to France 
<br>will offer an excellent opportunity to engage the leaders of 
<br>the newly-constituted government.
