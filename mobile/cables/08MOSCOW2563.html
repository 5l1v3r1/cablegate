<br>SUBJECT: MEDVEDEV LOSES OUT IN RUSSIA-GEORGIA WAR 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador John R. Beyrle: Reasons 1.4 (b, d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary. Unlike Putin, whose leadership during the
<br>Chechen war strengthened his political power, Medvedev's
<br>performance to date has reinforced his status as junior
<br>member of the tandem. Two anecdotal reports suggest that
<br>Putin was displeased with the President's performance at the
<br>start of the conflict; Putin, not Medvedev, set the tone and
<br>tenor of Russia's war policy. The conflict exposed Medvedev's
<br>weaknesses, his lack of a "team" of advisers, and the paucity
<br>of levers that he holds to influence policy, particularly in
<br>foreign affairs. While most Russians have yet to calculate
<br>the long-term consequences of the Georgian war, a near term
<br>conclusion is that the conflict has reinforced Medvedev's
<br>need for a "regent" and validated Putin as the man most
<br>Russians trust to protect their national interests. End
<br>Summary.
<br>
<br>Medvedev Stumbles
<br>-----------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) The war in Georgia capped Medvedev's first 100 days in
<br>office, and provided him the chance for a defining moment as
<br>the country's military and political chieftain. Yet, two
<br>anecdotal reports suggests that Medvedev blinked when the
<br>Georgian conflict began. xxxxx told the German Ambassador that Putin was deeply
<br>concerned by the failure of Medvedev to take immediate
<br>actions and to show resolve on August 8. Putin intervened
<br>repeatedly from Beijing, where he was attending the Olympics.
<br>Several phone calls took place between the Prime Minister
<br>and Medvedev, with Putin using a meeting with Kazakh
<br>President Nazarbayev to set the initial Russian public
<br>hard-line. Similarly, in either an indiscretion or a
<br>deliberate slight, FM Lavrov confided to the French
<br>Ambassador (on the margins of Sarkozy's August 12 visit to
<br>Moscow) that Medvedev had come in for significant criticism
<br>among the ruling party elite for his handling of the initial
<br>hours of the crisis.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) At first glance, the interaction between the two
<br>during the Georgia war appeared a confirmation of the
<br>"regency" model of leadership posited by many Kremlin
<br>observers about the tandem, with Putin taking charge when his
<br>protege faltered and then stepping back once he had righted
<br>the ship of state. Putin, not Medvedev, made the first
<br>strong public Russian address on the conflict after his
<br>return from China. His bristling speech in Vladikavkaz on
<br>August 9 set the tone and message of Moscow's approach:
<br>accusations of genocide, promises of aid to mitigate the
<br>"humanitarian disaster," and an explanation of Russian action
<br>as justified and legitimate. In the days that followed, a
<br>pale and tired Medvedev met with various military and
<br>government officials before the television cameras, but he
<br>never addressed the people directly -- in part because Putin
<br>had already done so. Olga Kryshtanovskaya of the Academy of
<br>Sciences Institute for the Study of Elites characterized
<br>Medvedev's performance during the first days of the war as a
<br>schoolboy who learned his lessons by rote, but without the
<br>vehemence of true conviction. Indeed, at one of the few
<br>public meetings between Putin and Medvedev, the Premier
<br>resorted to "suggestions" that the military prosecutor should
<br>look into evidence of "genocide" in South Ossetia, and
<br>Medvedev duly agreed to give the order.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) As the conflict cooled down and Medvedev took a
<br>visible role in hammering out a ceasefire agreement with
<br>French President Sarkozy, the public portrayal of the tandem
<br>began to shift back to its "proper" balance, even as the
<br>French told us it was Putin who joined the meeting to broker
<br>the "Medvedev-Sarkozy" agreement. Medvedev moved to the
<br>forefront of Russia's government controlled television stage
<br>and Putin returned to focus on other matters. According to
<br>the newspaper Kommersant, Levada Center polls in August
<br>showed a slight increase in popular perceptions of Medvedev's
<br>position in the tandem, with 14 percent of respondents
<br>agreeing that real power is in the President's hands, up from
<br>9 percent in June, but still far below the near 20 percent
<br>figure at the time of Medvedev's inauguration. Tellingly,
<br>nearly half of respondents saw Medvedev and Putin sharing
<br>power.
<br>
<br>100 Days Leaves Medvedev Poorly Prepared
<br>----------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Few are surprised that Medvedev was unprepared for the
<br>Georgian war. Before the conflict, Medvedev had focused on
<br>domestic issues that had been his forte as Deputy Premier.
<br>He had taken initial steps in his first three months in
<br>office to define himself: promoting the domestic themes of
<br>anti-corruption, economic modernization, and, in foreign
<br>policy, a new European security architecture. He also went as
<br>far as indirect criticism of Putin's attack on the Mechel
<br>coal company in late July. Pro-Kremlin commentators like
<br>lawyer Pavel Astakov and analyst Dmitriy Orlov in recent
<br>weeks penned paeans to what they claimed were Medvedev's
<br>successes in launching judicial reforms, promoting small
<br>business, and tackling the thorny issue of pervasive
<br>corruption.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) While debates have continued over whether Medvedev is
<br>a "liberal" or a Putin flunky, there is general consensus
<br>that Medvedev remains circumscribed in his ability act
<br>independently. xxxxx conceded
<br>that Medvedev had ambitions and was being pushed by his inner
<br>circle (largely remnants of the Yeltsin team) to be "more
<br>liberal," but he had no capacity to carry them through.
<br>xxxxx attributed this to Putin's shift of Kremlin cadre to
<br>the White House -- a move that left Medvedev largely adrift
<br>in his own administration. Editor/owner of the independent
<br>xxxxx judged Medvedev
<br>politically naive, despite 17 years in the inner circle.
<br>xxxxx who with eight other prominent editors attended a
<br>long, liquid dinner with the President, described Medvedev as
<br>saying the right things, but with no clear ability to
<br>translate them into practice.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) While Medvedev spoke vaguely of new European security
<br>structures, some argued that Putin remained the real foreign
<br>policy helmsman, who used informal relations and the creation
<br>of new White House entities to forge his own policy team. The
<br>newly appointed Director of the Russian Institute for
<br>Democracy in NY, Andranik Migranyan, judged to us that even
<br>before the Georgia crisis, Medvedev had taken a beating in
<br>foreign policy, with the appointment of Ambassador Yuri
<br>Ushakov to the White House a clear sign of Putin's
<br>encroachment on Kremlin turf. Medvedev lacked a foreign
<br>policy team, and his hesitancy, or "lack of tonality," on
<br>important issues was apparent in the diplomatic mishap at the
<br>G8 over Zimbabwe. Migranyan predicted that Putin would
<br>continue to dominate the policy milieu through his connection
<br>to the intelligence services and deployment of Ushakov.
<br>
<br>Looking Ahead
<br>-------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) For those who see Putin as protecting and developing
<br>his successor as "regent" -- including xxxxx and Gleb
<br>Pavlovskiy -- the conflict gave some indication of Medvedev's
<br>strengths and weakness during times of crisis. Medvedev
<br>stills needs Putin, according to Pavlovskiy, as the primary
<br>source of the President's legitimacy. If Putin were to leave
<br>office today, Medvedev would have a tough fight; in the eyes
<br>of half the Russian public, trust of Putin constitutes
<br>Medvedev's writ. Kryshtanovskaya argued that Putin cannot
<br>afford to allow Medvedev to lose his legitimacy as president,
<br>in that Putin has staked his reputation on his successor.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) For others, the war showed that Medvedev is not up to
<br>challenge of leadership. Russian Caucasus experts told DCM
<br>August 21 that Russia could not show weakness in the face of
<br>Georgia's challenge in South Ossetia for fear of both
<br>external and internal security consequences. Putin, not
<br>Medvedev, understood that and orchestrated the required
<br>action to meet the challenge, they argued.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) While most of our contacts agreed that 100 days is
<br>too short to draw conclusions, xxxxx and Kryshtanovskaya
<br>predicted the war could hasten a shift towards a
<br>parliamentary system. xxxxx characterized Putin's public
<br>persona as Russia's CEO, rolling up his sleeves on issues
<br>that matter more to Russians while Medvedev handles the
<br>ceremonial duties of President. He likened the situation to
<br>the German model, which Putin well understands, and posited
<br>that the Premier may aspire to play Chancellor to Medvedev's
<br>German President. Kryshtanovskaya likewise sees Putin as
<br>laying the foundation for a parliamentary republic, by taking
<br>the lead of Russia's most politically powerful party and
<br>shifting many formerly presidential functions to the White
<br>House.
<br>
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) After the Georgian conflict, nobody questions Putin's
<br>dominance of the political system. What remains to be seen
<br>is whether he intends to transfer the power mantle to
<br>Medvedev, as the "regency" school predicts, or to further
<br>consolidate his power as Premier. Putin's modus operandi is
<br>to create options and to avoid picking one particular path,
<br>suggesting that we will see him continue to follow both
<br>options as he waits to see how things play out. Among the
<br>populace, there is a sense of national pride and patriotism
<br>as the vast majority of Russians rally around the Kremlin.
<br>The success of Moscow's "short, victorious war" accrues to
<br>the tandem team, although we assess more so to Putin than the
<br>President. The Russian elite, highly attuned to signals from
<br>the Kremlin, are likely to see the Georgian war as evidence
<br>that it is too early to dismiss the influence of the silovik
<br>wing or its captain, Putin. And in light of the Kremlin
<br>wagon-circling we expect to follow the independence
<br>recognition decision, Medvedev's agenda of economic
<br>modernization, anti-corruption, and European security focus
<br>will lose any sense of urgency that it might have had. End
<br>comment.
