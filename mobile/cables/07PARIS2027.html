<br>
<br>SUMMARY 
<br>------- 
<br>¶1. (SBU) Intent on maintaining the momentum for reform, 
<br>President Sarkozy moved quickly following his inauguration 
<br>May 16 (ref B). Sarkozy named his administration's first 
<br>Prime Minster, Francois Fillon the following day, May 17, 
<br>then immediately named the line-up of the Fillon government 
<br>on May 18. The new government includes major figures from 
<br>the wing of Sarkozy's own Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) 
<br>party that opposed Sarkozy's nomination as the party's 
<br>presidential candidate, from the opposition Socialist Party 
<br>(PS) (Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner) and from the 
<br>centrist Union for French Democracy (UDF) party (Defense 
<br>Minister Herve Morin). The Fillon government ministerial team 
<br>is the fruit of Sarkozy's outreach efforts across the 
<br>political spectrum in the days immediately following his 
<br>election (ref A). Sarkozy -- very confident that the UMP 
<br>will keep its parliamentary majority following the upcoming 
<br>June 10 and 17 legislative elections -- may well be 
<br>accelerating his plans to implement reforms; the newly named 
<br>government is designed to reflect multi-partisan 
<br>responsibility for the upcoming reform effort, which will be 
<br>actively, personally directed by Sarkozy himself. END 
<br>SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>BROAD-BASED GOVERNMENT NAMED QUICKLY 
<br>----------------------------------- 
<br>¶2. (U) As expected, President Nicolas Sarkozy -- after 
<br>naming Francois Fillon on May 17 the Sarkozy administration's 
<br>first prime minister -- immediately also named the members of 
<br>the Fillon government. On May 18, Claude Gueant, the new 
<br>Secretary General of the Elysee Palace who served as 
<br>
<br>SIPDIS 
<br>Sarkozy's campaign manager during the presidential race, 
<br>announced the composition of the new government (for list 
<br>names and bio info see paras 7 - 32 below). This government 
<br>is the result of 1) Sarkozy's early decision to name Fillon 
<br>PM (ref B), as all UMP electoral projections kept indicating 
<br>a very likely Sarkozy victory; and 2) Sarkozy's unexpected 
<br>outreach efforts across the political spectrum in the days 
<br>following his May 10 election victory (ref A). 
<br>
<br>"SARKOZY'S REFORM TEAM" 
<br>----------------------- 
<br>¶3. (U) This government is "Sarkozy's reform team," with 
<br>Fillon in the role of executive officer. All indications are 
<br>that the UMP will keep its current majority in the National 
<br>Assembly in the upcoming June 10 and 17 legislative 
<br>elections. The composition of this government -- which 
<br>includes prominent members from the formerly anti-Sarkozy 
<br>faction of the UMP (Juppe and Alliot-Marie) and a member from 
<br>the opposition Socialist Party (PS) Kouchner) and one from 
<br>the centrist Union for French Democracy (UDF) party (Morin)-- 
<br>is designed to add the "multi-partisan, unity government" 
<br>card to Sarkozy's already very strong hand (a mandate-giving 
<br>victory and a new parliamentary majority) for pursuing his 
<br>reform agenda. On the reform implementation front, all 
<br>indications are that Sarkozy plans to keep up the pace he as 
<br>set not only in naming his administration's first government 
<br>in record time, but also in naming a government that, in 
<br>effect, significantly restructures France's executive branch. 
<br>
<br>FOUR FACETS OF RESTRUCTURING 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br>¶4. (SBU) As promised, the number of ministries has been 
<br>reduced to 15, driving a re-structuring of functions that 
<br>divides the large and un-agile mega-ministries of economy and 
<br>interior each into two "new" ministries. Sarkozy's 
<br>restructuring also includes the creation of a "super 
<br>ministry" of Ecology and Sustainable Development. It also 
<br>overtly moves foreign policy direction to the Elysee. The 
<br>economy ministry has been split into a pro-active Ministry of 
<br>Economy, Finance and Employment under former Social 
<br>Solidarity Minister Jean-Louis Borloo, and a more 
<br>accounting-oriented Ministry of Budget, Public Accounting and 
<br>Civil Service under UMP parliamentarian Eric Woerth. The 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00002027 002.2 OF 007 
<br>
<br>
<br>core interior ministry security functions remain in an 
<br>Interior Ministry under former Defense Minister Michelle 
<br>Alliot-Marie, as immigration and naturalization matters move 
<br>to a new Ministry of Immigration, Integration, National 
<br>Identity and Co-development under Sarkozy's closest political 
<br>ally, Brice Hortefeux. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (U) Sarkozy's re-structuring includes the creation of a 
<br>Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Sustainable 
<br>Planning under former Prime Minster Alain Juppe. Juppe also 
<br>gets the title of Minister of State, which makes him number 
<br>two in the government after Prime Minister Fillon. With 
<br>regard to foreign affairs, Sarkozy has put policy direction 
<br>firmly under his personal control at the Elysee through a 
<br>far-reaching role for outgoing Ambassador to the U.S. 
<br>Jean-David Levitte, in a role similar to that of the U.S. 
<br>National Security Advisor. By naming Socialist Bernard 
<br>Kouchner (of Doctors Without Borders fame) as Foreign 
<br>Minster, Sarkozy has put an emphasis on humanitarian and 
<br>human rights matters in the mission of the Quai d'Orsay 
<br>
<br>A GOVERNMENT OF GENDER PARITY 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br>¶6. (U) Also as promised, the new government observes gender 
<br>parity -- seven of the new ministers are women. They are 
<br>Michele Alliot-Marie (Minister of Interior, Overseas 
<br>Territories and Local Governments), Rachida Dati (Minister of 
<br>Justice), Valerie Pecresse (Minister of Higher Education and 
<br>Research), Roselyn Bachelot (Minister of Health, Youth and 
<br>Sports), Christine Boutin (Minister of Housing and Cities), 
<br>Christine Lagarde (Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries), 
<br>and Christine Albanel (Minister of Culture and Communication, 
<br>Government Spokeswoman). Incidentally, the three top 
<br>officials in this new French administration, President 
<br>Sarkozy, Prime Minister Fillon and Minister of State Juppe 
<br>are graduates of the U.S. Government's International Visitor 
<br>Program (IVP) (Sarkozy in 1985, Fillon in 1984 and Juppe in 
<br>1978). It is also noteworthy that the two top officials, 
<br>Sarkozy and Fillon, are not graduates of France's elite 
<br>school for top civil-servants, the National School of 
<br>Administration (ENA). There follow biographical sketches of 
<br>the new government's Prime Minister (Fillon), Foreign Minster 
<br>(Kouchner), Defense Minister (Morin) and the government's 
<br>number two (Juppe), who is Minister of Ecology, Sustainable 
<br>Development and Sustainable Planning, and thumbnail bios of 
<br>the other members of the new government. 
<br>
<br>Prime Minister ) Francois Fillon 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>¶7. (SBU) Francois Fillon, a former Gaullist with a keen 
<br>interest in social affairs and defense issues, was named 
<br>Prime Minister on May 17, 2007. Fillon broke ranks with 
<br>former President Chirac following the UMP's crushing 
<br>electoral defeats in the regional and European elections of 
<br>¶2004. Fillon blamed Chirac's slow pace of social reforms for 
<br>that electoral defeat, and has since vowed to move quickly to 
<br>implement President Sarkozy's reform agenda. Fillon is best 
<br>known for pushing through a controversial reform of the 
<br>national pension system in 2003 -- arguably the most 
<br>significant reform passed during Jacques Chirac's 12-year 
<br>presidency. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU) Fillon served in the Raffarin government as 
<br>Minister of Education from 2004-05, and as Minister of Social 
<br>Affairs, Labor, and Solidarity from 2002-04. Fillon is given 
<br>high marks for his handling of several politically sensitive 
<br>labor reform measures during the 2002-04 period, including a 
<br>de facto extension of the 35-hour workweek (by allowing 
<br>employees to work more overtime hours); simplifying and 
<br>raising the minimum wage; and passage of a controversial 
<br>pension reform bill. Several of Fillon's proposed reforms to 
<br>the education system, however, were watered down or withdrawn 
<br>in an (ultimately unsuccessful) effort to mollify public 
<br>opinion in advance of the vote on the EU Constitution. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (SBU) Fillon served as a National Assembly Deputy from 
<br>the Sarthe department (in western France) between 1981-93 and 
<br>1997-2002. Throughout the 1980s and 90s, he was considered a 
<br>leading expert on defense-related issues and served as 
<br>chairman of the Assembly's Defense Committee during 1986-88. 
<br>He was among the few Gaullists to call for greater French 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00002027 003.2 OF 007 
<br>
<br>
<br>participation in NATO. Fillon also served as Minister for 
<br>Higher Education and Research during the government of 
<br>Edouard Balladur (1993-95), and as Deputy Minister for Posts, 
<br>Telecommunications, and Space during the government of Alain 
<br>Juppe (1995-97). Fillon's political career includes a 
<br>four-year stint (1998-2002) as President of the 
<br>Pays-de-la-Loire Regional Council in western France. He was 
<br>elected to the Senate in 2005 representing his native Sarthe 
<br>department. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (SBU) Fillon understands English, but prefers to speak 
<br>French. He met his British-born wife, the former Penelope 
<br>Clarke from Wales, when she was an English instructor at the 
<br>university Fillon also attended in the Maine region of 
<br>France. The couple has five children. Fillon has made 
<br>several trips to the United States, including a tour as an IV 
<br>grantee in 1984. 
<br>
<br>Minister of Foreign and European 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>Affairs ) Bernard Kouchner 
<br>-------------------------- 
<br>¶11. (SBU) In a surprise move, President Sarkozy has 
<br>appointed world renowned humanitarian Bernard Kouchner as 
<br>Minister of Foreign and European Affairs. Kouchner's 
<br>appointment to lead the Quai d'Orsay represents the 
<br>fulfillment of a longtime dream for the celebrated champion 
<br>of humanitarian causes. Kouchner has made a career out of 
<br>drawing attention to international humanitarian issues. His 
<br>numerous efforts include projects in Somalia, Bosnia, 
<br>Northern Iraq, Nagorno-Karabakh, Sudan, Ethiopia and Lebanon. 
<br>Considered a maverick among his Socialist Party colleagues, 
<br>Kouchner was one of the few politicians (left or right) to 
<br>openly support the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. An 
<br>experienced administrator, he has held three ministerial 
<br>portfolios in Socialist governments: as Junior-Minister for 
<br>Health (1997-98 and 2001-2002), as Minister of Health and 
<br>Humanitarian Affairs (1992-93), and as Secretary of State for 
<br>Humanitarian Affairs (1988-92). During 1994-97, Kouchner 
<br>served as a Member of the European Parliament. He officially 
<br>joined the Socialist Party in 1998. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (U) Appointed by then-Secretary General Kofi Annan, 
<br>Kouchner served as the UN's Special Representative in Kosovo 
<br>during 1999-2001. In this capacity he acted as a virtual 
<br>governor of the province during its occupation by a NATO-led 
<br>peacekeeping force. He had the power to levy taxes, write 
<br>new laws, and form a police force. Kouchner's appointment 
<br>represented a diplomatic victory for President Jacques 
<br>Chirac, who lobbied aggressively on Kouchner's behalf. Upon 
<br>conclusion of his mandate, Kouchner received international 
<br>praise for his competence, objectivity, and dedication. In 
<br>recent years Kouchner has unsuccessfully bid on two top IO 
<br>positions: UN High Commissioner on Refugees and head of the 
<br>World Health Organization. 
<br>
<br>¶13. (U) Kouchner has been active in aiding distressed 
<br>populations throughout the world since the late-1960s, when 
<br>he began working in Biafra and Chad. A gastroenterologist by 
<br>training, Kouchner left his Paris medical practice behind 
<br>and, in 1971, helped found &Medecins Sans Frontieres8 
<br>(Doctors Without Borders), an organization of volunteer 
<br>doctors dedicated to helping patients in disadvantaged 
<br>countries around the world. Following a rift with other 
<br>founding members, Kouchner set up Doctors of the World in 
<br>¶1980. 
<br>
<br>¶14. (SBU) Kouchner was born on November 1, 1939. Kouchner 
<br>has three children by a prior relationship. His longtime 
<br>companion, Christine Ockrent, hosts a news program on the 
<br>state-run TV network France 3. They have one child. 
<br>Kouchner speaks excellent English. 
<br>
<br>Minister of Defense ) Herve Morin 
<br>--------------------------------- 
<br>¶15. (SBU) Herve Morin has represented the rural, 3rd 
<br>district of the Eure department in the National Assembly 
<br>since 1988. He is a member of the centrist Union for French 
<br>Democracy (UDF) party. Morin has been the leader of the UDF 
<br>parliamentary group in the assembly since 2002, and was 
<br>widely seen as the leader of the UDF parliamentarians who 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00002027 004.2 OF 007 
<br>
<br>
<br>rallied to Sarkozy once UDF leader Francois Bayrou was 
<br>eliminated in the first round of the presidential race. 
<br>Morin has been a close Embassy contact. Friendly and direct, 
<br>he is unabashed about his affection for the U.S., often 
<br>referring to his Normandy roots and the grateful memories of 
<br>the Liberation that he calls "our heritage." The French 
<br>press characterizes Morin as among the most Atlanticist of 
<br>all deputies. A relative newcomer on the national political 
<br>stage, Morin worked as an administrator in the National 
<br>Assembly beginning in 1978, and thus cannot be considered a 
<br>neophyte in the Assembly's corridors of power. He was a 
<br>counselor for parliamentary relations to then-Minister of 
<br>Defense Francois Leotard (UDF) during 1993-95, and also 
<br>served as spokesman and project coordinator for Francois 
<br>Bayrou's 2002 presidential campaign. 
<br>
<br>¶16. (SBU) In relatively short order, Morin became a member of 
<br>Bayrou's inner circle, largely by remaining a UDF loyalist 
<br>while other party leaders were defecting to Chirac's camp in 
<br>the run-up to the 2002 presidential election. In Bayrou's 
<br>2007 presidential bid, Morin filled a range of roles in the 
<br>campaign: coordinator for special communication projects and 
<br>point man for refuting UMP charges made against UDF 
<br>proposals. Morin understands some English, but prefers to 
<br>speak French. 
<br>
<br>Minister of Ecology and Development ) Alain Juppe 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br>¶17. (SBU) Former Prime Minister Alain Juppe, once famously 
<br>described as "the best among us" by his mentor Jacques 
<br>Chirac, has returned to the national political stage to lead 
<br>a new "super ministry of ecology and economic development" 
<br>formally called the Ministry of Ecology and Sustainable 
<br>Development and Planning. Juppe also gets the, largely 
<br>honorary, but coveted Minister of State title which places 
<br>him second (behind PM Fillon) in the government's official 
<br>protocol ranking. Juppe's high-profile appointment 
<br>underlines President Sarkozy's commitment to leading action 
<br>on global warming. In his May 6 victory address to the 
<br>nation, Sarkozy highlighted the need for the United States, 
<br>with France, to "take the lead" in the fight against climate 
<br>change. 
<br>
<br>¶18. (SBU) Juppe's appointment to a senior government post 
<br>represents a political comeback for the man once seen as 
<br>Jacques Chirac's likeliest (and preferred) successor. 
<br>Juppe's conviction, in 2004, on charges relating illegally 
<br>paid for political party staffers severely damaged his 
<br>political career. Juppe was given a 14-month suspended 
<br>sentence and one-year of ineligibility from holding public 
<br>office. Juppe was forced to resign from both his seat in the 
<br>National Assembly and his local elective office as mayor of 
<br>Bordeaux. But more importantly, his resignation from the 
<br>presidency of the UMP opened the door for Nicolas Sarkozy to 
<br>take over. During 2005 Juppe taught a year-long seminar on 
<br>globalization at Quebec's National School of Administration. 
<br>During his stint in North America he became increasingly 
<br>interested in environmental advocacy and, by his own account, 
<br>was greatly influenced by the anti-global warming campaign 
<br>directed by former Vice-President Al Gore. 
<br>
<br>Minister of Economy, Finance and 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>Employment -- Jean Louis Borloo 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>¶19. (SBU) Jean-Louis Borloo has been tapped to lead the 
<br>newly revamped Ministry of Economy, Finance and Employment 
<br>which now includes enhanced powers over employment issues and 
<br>economic strategy. A political maverick with a populist 
<br>streak, Borloo previously served in the Raffarin and Villepin 
<br>governments as Minister for Employment, Labor and Social 
<br>Cohesion during 2004-07. He was also Junior Minister for 
<br>Towns and Urban Renewal from 2002-04. In recent months 
<br>Borloo has overseen development of Nicolas Sarkozy's 
<br>so-called "Marshall Plan for the Suburbs," which seeks to 
<br>revive employment and education prospects in immigrant 
<br>neighborhoods. Self-assured, frank and quick-to-action, 
<br>Borloo remains a highly popular figure among the general 
<br>public. 
<br>
<br>Minister of Interior, Overseas Territories 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00002027 005.2 OF 007 
<br>
<br>
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br>and Local Governments -- Michele Alliot-Marie 
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br>¶20. (SBU) Neo-Gaullist Michele Alliot-Marie has been named 
<br>to lead the Ministry of Interior, Overseas Territories and 
<br>Local Governments by President Nicolas Sarkozy. Often 
<br>referred to by her initials as "MAM" in the French press, 
<br>Alliot-Marie is one of the few holdovers from the Chirac 
<br>administration and was likely retained because of her strong 
<br>support during the campaign and, at least in part, because of 
<br>Sarkozy's desire to maintain gender parity in his new 
<br>administration. Alliot-Marie served ably as Minister of 
<br>Defense from 2002-07, becoming the first woman in French 
<br>history to hold that position. Known as a "hands-on" 
<br>minister, Alliot-Marie was well liked and respected by French 
<br>Armed Forces personnel. During her tenure she fought 
<br>successfully to prevent drastic cuts to the defense budget, 
<br>and made several visits to French troops stationed in 
<br>Afghanistan and Africa. Alliot-Marie also demonstrated a 
<br>sincere desire to maintain good U.S.-French 
<br>military-to-military relations, although she maintained a 
<br>problematic relationship with former Defense Minister Donald 
<br>Rumsfeld on such issues as European security (ESDP) and 
<br>coordinated European procurement (EDA). 
<br>
<br>Minister of Immigration, Integration, National 
<br>--------------------------------------------- - 
<br>Identity and Co-Development ) Brice Hortefeux 
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br>¶21. (SBU) Long-time Sarkozy ally Brice Hortefeux has been 
<br>appointed to lead the newly created Ministry of Immigration, 
<br>Integration, National Identity and Co-Development. During 
<br>the 2007 presidential campaign Sarkozy said that immigration 
<br>reform would be a top priority of his administration and that 
<br>he wanted to create a single agency in order to consolidate 
<br>the administration of immigration policy portfolio that was 
<br>spread out among three different ministries. Hortefeux is 
<br>one of Sarkozy's oldest friends and political allies. He 
<br>served as Junior Minister of Collective Territories in the 
<br>old Villepin government from 2005-07. He was also a member 
<br>of the European Parliament from 1999 to 2005. According to 
<br>the press, Hortefeux and Cecilia Sarkozy, the president's 
<br>highly influential wife, often clashed during the run-up to 
<br>the 2007 presidential election. Hortefeux has maintained 
<br>close ties with the Embassy over the years, although in 
<br>private he has been a harsh critic of President George W. 
<br>Bush's policy in Iraq. 
<br>
<br>Minister of Justice ) Rachida Dati 
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br>¶22. (SBU) Sarkozy protege Rachida Dati has been tapped to 
<br>serve as Minister of Justice ("Garde de Sceaux"). A lawyer 
<br>and former magistrate born to North African immigrants, Dati 
<br>joined Sarkozy at the Interior Ministry in 2002 as an advisor 
<br>on delinquency issues where she helped build up a network of 
<br>contacts and supporters among the immigrant community. 
<br>Impressed by her poise, intelligence and hard-driving work 
<br>ethic, Sarkozy later choose Dati to serve as a 
<br>co-spokesperson for his presidential campaign. Her political 
<br>experience began in 1995 when she joined the staff of the 
<br>Education Ministry. From 1997-99 she worked in the justice 
<br>ministry as an internal auditor, before being named a 
<br>magistrate at a criminal court in a town called Peronne. In 
<br>2001 she was named acting magistrate at the criminal court in 
<br>Evry, a suburb of Paris, where she specialized in financial 
<br>crime cases. Dati was born on November 27, 1965 in 
<br>Saint-Remy, France. Dati's Moroccan immigrant parents were 
<br>poor; hers is an up-from-poverty success story made possible 
<br>by hard work and free public education. She holds an 
<br>economic science degree from the Higher School of Business 
<br>(1993) and later took a masters in law (1996). She graduated 
<br>from the National School of Magistrates in 1997. Dati is 
<br>unmarried. Dati does not speak English. 
<br>
<br>Minister of Labor, Social Relations 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br>and Solidarity ) Xavier Bertrand 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>¶23. (SBU) President Nicolas Sarkozy has named UMP rising 
<br>star Xavier Bertrand to lead the newly created Ministry of 
<br>Labor, Social Relations and Solidarity. A formidable 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00002027 006.2 OF 007 
<br>
<br>
<br>debater, Bertrand served admirably as one of Sarkozy's 
<br>spokespersons during the 2007 presidential campaign. A 
<br>relative newcomer on the national political scene, Bertrand 
<br>served in the Raffarin government as State Secretary for 
<br>Social Security from April 2004 to June 2005. During this 
<br>period he was responsible for negotiating with union and 
<br>employer representatives regarding the reform of France's 
<br>nearly-bankrupt health insurance system. In recognition for

<br>Minister of Health and Solidarity when Dominique de Villepin 
<br>took over the reigns of government in 2005. He resigned for 
<br>the government on March 26, 2007 in order to devote himself

<br>from visiting U.S. officials to help contain the Chikungunya

<br>Secondary Education from 2002-04. A former senator from the 
<br>Dordogne region in southwestern France (1997-2002), Darcos

<br>since 2004, but does not appear closely allied to Nicolas
