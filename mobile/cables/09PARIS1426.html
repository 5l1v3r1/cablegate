<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: Embassy Paris welcomes the visit of FBI 
<br>Director Mueller. The timing of this first trip is ideal, 
<br>with our bilateral relationship at its highest point in fifty 
<br>years. You will find your interlocutors energized by the 
<br>President,s visits to Paris and Normandy and they look 
<br>forward to getting a sense of your strategy for the next 
<br>year, and will want to know how they and other like-minded 
<br>European states can contribute to the success of your 
<br>efforts. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>MINISTRY OF INTERIOR 
<br>-------------------- 
<br>¶2. (SBU) The Ministry of Interior directs a civilian force of 
<br>146,000 national police who operate with a force of 99,509 
<br>national gendarmes to maintain internal security. Sarkozy 
<br>merged the two primary internal intelligence agencies, 
<br>Direction de la Surveillance du Territoire (DST) and 
<br>Renseignements Gnraux (RG), in May 2008 to form a French 
<br>equivalent to the FBI. The goals of the merger include 
<br>removing interagency competition detrimental to France,s 
<br>counter-terrorism efforts, increasing operational capability, 
<br>and phasing out redundancies. Foreign intelligence agencies 
<br>now have a single internal intelligence interlocutor in 
<br>France, that should increase and simplify cooperation. The 
<br>organization is led by Bernard Squarcini, former deputy 
<br>director of the RG, and close friend of President Sarkozy. A 
<br>working group at the directorate general of the national 
<br>police has been meeting regularly to work out the new 
<br>structure of the merged intelligence service, including its 
<br>jurisdiction, size, and missions. The media reports that the 
<br>RG will no longer monitor public opinion, union activities, 
<br>and social conflicts, but details of on-the-ground changes in 
<br>responsibilities remain unknown. Frdric Pchenard, 
<br>director-general of the French national police is overseeing 
<br>the merger. 
<br>
<br>COUNTER-TERRORISM 
<br>----------------- 
<br>¶3. (SBU) France is one of a number of major European 
<br>countries combating terrorism at home and abroad, although it 
<br>has not suffered a significant terrorist incident in recent 
<br>years. Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) poses a 
<br>considerable threat to French interests, underscored by 
<br>statements made by al-Qaida senior leadership or AQIM itself. 
<br>Local Corsican separatists, Basque Fatherland and Liberty 
<br>(ETA) members and ultra-left anarchist factions have been 
<br>responsible for the majority of recent attacks and arrests of 
<br>individuals suspected of involvement in terrorist activities 
<br>or membership of groups deemed terrorist. The number and 
<br>violence of ETA and Corsican attacks in France have continued 
<br>to drop, but France is at once a target as well as a 
<br>potential staging area for international Islamic terrorist 
<br>groups, including Kurdistan Workers party affiliates. France 
<br>remains on high alert and recognizes its continuing status as 
<br>a target of AQIM and of other extremist groups in France and 
<br>abroad. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) Loic Garnier was appointed in June to succeed 
<br>Christophe Chaboud as the head of the Ministry of Interior,s 
<br>Unite de Coordination de la Lutte Anti-Terroriste (UCLAT). 
<br>Superintendant Garnier was formerly chief of the criminal 
<br>brigade, the elite unit of the judicial police in Paris. 
<br>
<br>RADICALISM 
<br>---------- 
<br>¶5. (SBU) In addition to undertaking operations to arrest and 
<br>prosecute terrorists, France continued programs to address 
<br>radicalization and extremism through the use of social and 
<br>economic incentives to reduce the susceptibility of at risk 
<br>populations. 
<br>
<br>DOMESTIC POLITICS 
<br>----------------- 
<br>¶6. (C) Now approaching the midpoint of his five year term, 
<br>President Sarkozy is comfortably riding the momentum 
<br>generated by a successful showing in last June's European 
<br>Parliament elections that weakened the UMP's primary 
<br>opponent, the Socialist Party. With the opposition in 
<br>disarray, Sarkozy hopes to extend his political power base by 
<br>scoring big in upcoming regional council elections in March 
<br>¶2010. Regional elections will be an important snapshot of 
<br>his presidency at mid-term, and the relative strength of 
<br>French political parties before the presidential and 
<br>legislative elections in 2012. In recent months, Sarkozy and 
<br>his majority UMP party have concentrated on joining forces 
<br>with a number of small political parties from across the 
<br>political spectrum to ensure his reelection. Sarkozy has 
<br>sought to lead on security and immigration issues, an issue 
<br>that brought him considerable notoriety during his tenure as 
<br>Minister of Interior under President Chirac. 
<br>
<br>Anti-immigration sentiment has been a rallying cry for the 
<br>extremist National Front. 
<br>
<br>MILITARY ISSUES 
<br>--------------- 
<br>¶7. (SBU) In conjunction with specific gendarmes units used 
<br>for military operations, the army is responsible for external 
<br>security under the Ministry of Defense. France currently has 
<br>over 3,000 troops actively participating in operations in 
<br>Afghanistan and Operation Enduring Freedom. The current 
<br>French commitment includes ground troops and air assets. 
<br>There is growing media discussion in France about the 
<br>McChrystal report, which advocates additional troops for 
<br>Afghanistan, and the Obama administration,s review of 
<br>policy. However, Sarkozy used an October 15/16 interview 
<br>with Le Figaro (focused on domestic issues and designed to 
<br>shore up his base), to state that France would send ¬ one 
<br>additional soldier8 to Afghanistan, although there may be 
<br>room for increased civilian engagement, especially if the 
<br>Afghan government is able to restore legitimacy in the wake 
<br>of the troubled August 20 elections. Unlike several other 
<br>significant European troop contributors through ISAF, the 
<br>French do not have overly restrictive rules of engagement and 
<br>have been a strong ally in the field. (Note: the 
<br>&European8 gendarme force Sarkozy proposed last spring will 
<br>finally begin to arrive in Afghanistan in December.) 
<br>
<br>DATASHARE 
<br>--------- 
<br>¶8. (U) We do not have an agreement with France for Preventing 
<br>and Combating Serious Crime (PCSC). The French have 
<br>generally pointed to their privacy laws as an impediment. 
<br>The U.S. side has countered that our privacy laws are similar 
<br>and not a bar to enhanced datashare. The draft text of an 
<br>Agreement was shared with the French Ministry of Interior in 
<br>July 2009. U.S. Embassy Paris also transmitted a Diplomatic 
<br>Note to the French Foreign Ministry in August 2009 requesting 
<br>that in-depth discussions on both a PCSC Agreement and an 
<br>HSPD-6 agreement concerning terrorist watchlist data begin as 
<br>soon as possible. Despite the difficulties of getting 
<br>negotiations underway, U.S. law enforcement officials 
<br>describe cooperation with their French Government 
<br>counterparts as very good within the context of French 
<br>privacy restrictions. 
<br>
<br>TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS 
<br>---------------------- 
<br>¶9. (SBU) The constitution and law prohibit trafficking in 
<br>persons for all purposes. However, trafficking in women and 
<br>children for commercial sexual exploitation, forced labor, 
<br>and petty crime is a problem. Prostitution is legal. 
<br>However, the law prohibits procuring, aiding, assisting, 
<br>maintaining, publicly soliciting, or profiting from the 
<br>prostitution of another individual. Enforcement of these 
<br>laws varied, and criminal activity related to prostitution 
<br>remained a problem. The country was a destination for 
<br>victims, primarily trafficked from Africa (notably Cameroon 
<br>and Nigeria), Central and Eastern Europe (notably Bulgaria 
<br>and Romania), the former Soviet Union, and increasingly Asia 
<br>(notably China), for prostitution and domestic servitude. A 
<br>majority of the estimated 18,000 women in the country,s 
<br>commercial sex trade were likely victims of trafficking. 
<br>Traffickers operated principally in small criminal networks 
<br>characterized as &micro-trafficking networks8 that included 
<br>both citizens and foreigners. They used various methods to 
<br>recruit and retain victims including force, fraud, 
<br>identification document confiscation, cultural isolation, and 
<br>physical and psychological abuse. Several law enforcement 
<br>agencies were involved in combating trafficking. The 
<br>government cooperated bilaterally and with international 
<br>institutions such as the European Police Agency (Europol) to 
<br>investigate, track, and dismantle trafficking networks, 
<br>initiating more than 500 court cases for soliciting and 
<br>dismantling over 23 pimping networks in 2008. Authorities 
<br>worked with officials in other countries, particularly source 
<br>countries, to counter trafficking and identified 822 victims 
<br>during the year. 
<br>
<br>COUNTRY CONDITIONS 
<br>------------------ 
<br>¶10. (U) France is a first-world western democracy with a 
<br>varied economy and one of the most diverse populations in 
<br>Western Europe. At least 20% of the French population of 
<br>approximately 65 million people has either a parent or a 
<br>grandparent who is or was not originally French. Most 
<br>European migrants who arrived before about 1970 have 
<br>integrated fairly effectively into French life; however, more 
<br>recent migrants and their families, many from the former 
<br>French colonies, have not been able to find a place in French 
<br>society as readily. Although there are no official 
<br>statistics, fully ten percent of France,s population is 
<br>Muslim, which have helped inform the country,s developed and 
<br>
<br>nuanced views from the Middle East Peace Process to 
<br>assimilation of minority populations. France continues to be 
<br>an asylum destination for immigrants attracted by France's 
<br>relatively generous social security, welfare and education 
<br>systems. Many migrants remain in France "without papers" to 
<br>work illegally (estimates range from 300,000 to 400,000 
<br>clandestine residents in 2008). The Government of France has 
<br>responded with a combination of integration and enforcement 
<br>measures. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (U) The worldwide economic crisis has increased the 
<br>unemployment rate to 7.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 
<br>¶2008. High unemployment among the young (especially 
<br>undereducated young men of foreign origin), public tensions 
<br>among those of different social and ethnic groups, and 
<br>inadequate low-income housing all contribute to political, 
<br>social, and economic criticism of the Sarkozy administration. 
<br>
<br>Good luck with your travels in the region. We look forward 
<br>to welcoming you again to Paris. 
<br>
<br>Best regards,
