<br>YEMEN AND JOINT MILITARY EXERCISES 
<br> 
<br>REF: KUWAIT 724 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: DCM Tom Williams for reasons 1.4 b and d 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (S) CENTCOM Commander GEN David Petraeus, accompanied by 
<br>Ambassador, engaged in a wide-ranging exchange on the evening 
<br>of July 22 with Kuwaiti Armed Forces Deputy Chief of Staff 
<br>(DCOS) LTG Ahmed Khalid Al Sabah.  Key Points: 
<br> 
<br>-- (C) On Iraq, General Petraeus said the USG appreciates 
<br>Kuwait's robust aid for our Iraq efforts; Kuwait's security 
<br>remains a top U.S. priority, and we will coordinate closely 
<br>on force outflows from Iraq.  The U.S. forces relied on 
<br>support from Kuwait for our efforts in Afghanistan as well. 
<br>Kuwait should remain open to engagement with Iraq as a means 
<br>to help resolve disputes between the two countries and help 
<br>Iraq achieve greater stability.  DCOS Al Sabah responded that 
<br>Kuwait seeks to rebuild relations with Iraq and prefers that 
<br>negotiations between Iraq and Kuwait on international 
<br>disputes be under the UN aegis. 
<br> 
<br>-- (S) On Iran, Kuwait's head of Military Intelligence said 
<br>the fate of Iran is in Supreme Leader Khamene'i's hands.  He 
<br>must either compromise with Ayatollah Rafsanjani or continue 
<br>to support President Ahmadinejad.  He assessed that the 
<br>public had crossed the "fear line," and continued protests 
<br>against the government were a possibility.  He thought it 
<br>would be important to see the Supreme Leader's response to 
<br>protests.  Continued unrest and government repression may be 
<br>the catalyst that provokes Iranian security forces to crack 
<br>down, align with the masses, or fracture. 
<br> 
<br>-- (C) On CT, General Petraeus noted USG appreciation for 
<br>recent CT actions by Kuwait's Interior Ministry forces, and 
<br>said passage of comprehensive anti-terror legislation would 
<br>greatly facilitate further efforts. 
<br> 
<br>-- (C)  General Petraeus characterized the bilateral security 
<br>relationship as strong, and welcomed the upcoming Joint 
<br>Military Commission (JMC) in October, as well as Kuwait's 
<br>continued participation in joint military exercises. 
<br> 
<br>Iraq 
<br>---- 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (C) GEN Petraeus thanked the GOK for its support for 
<br>Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and its facilitation of U.S. 
<br>forces deploying and redeploying through Kuwait.  He provided 
<br>his congratulations on the results of the recent 
<br>Parliamentary elections, noting in particular the election of 
<br>four U.S.-educated women, and said that it was encouraging to 
<br>see Kuwait's recent counter-terrorism progress.  Petraeus 
<br>also thanked the GOK for its financial, reconstruction, and 
<br>moral support for Iraq during OIF.  He urged that the GOK 
<br>continue to remain open to negotiate disputes between Iraq 
<br>and Kuwait, and hoped that such negotiations would be 
<br>concluded successfully.  He assessed that with assistance 
<br>from its Arab neighbors Iraq would "muddle through" towards 
<br>stability.  Though establishing Iraqi stability absorbs a 
<br>great amount of USG focus, he reassured the DCOS that Kuwaiti 
<br>security would remain a priority for the U.S., and also 
<br>promised that the U.S. would closely coordinate with the GOK 
<br>on working through the logistics of support for the 
<br>withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq through Kuwait.  GEN 
<br>Petraeus said Iraqi PM Maliki's visit to Washington would 
<br>provide an opportunity for discussion on issues of concern to 
<br>Kuwait, such as compensation, borders, and recovering the 
<br>remains of Kuwaiti prisoners still missing from the 1990 
<br>invasion and Iraqi occupation.  General Petraeus briefed the 
<br>DCOS on levels of violence in Iraq, noting that the surge of 
<br>US forces, fighting side-by-side with Iraqi forces that now 
<br>number nearly 650,000, has contributed greatly to growing 
<br>stability.  U.S. combat forces have completed their 
<br>withdrawal from Iraqi cities, although advisors and liaison 
<br>elements remain along with joint coordination centers in 
<br>Basra, Baghdad, and Mosul that provide the Iraqis with access 
<br>to U.S. enablers and expertise. 
<br>¶3.  (C) In response, the DCOS -- who was personally held as a 
<br>POW during the Iraqi invasion -- expressed a desire to 
<br>rebuild relations with Iraq, but, echoing the policy of the 
<br>GOK, said that all Kuwaiti-concerned negotiations with Iraq 
<br>should be conducted under the auspices of the UN.  GEN 
<br>Petraeus informed him, that in a recent conversation with 
<br>Vice President Biden, he recommended that former Special 
<br>Representative of the UN Secretary General Staffan de Mistura 
<br>adjudicate the Iraq/Kuwait dispute. 
<br>

<br> 
<br> 
<br>Iran 
<br>---- 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (S) BG Abdulrahman al-Hadhood, Chief of Kuwaiti Military 
<br>Intelligence, in a frank discussion on Iran, asserted that 
<br>the future of Iran, and its relations with its regional 
<br>neighbors, is in the hands of Supreme Leader Grand Ayatollah 
<br>Khamene'i.  The direction in which Khamene'i will lead Iran 
<br>in this post-presidential election era will largely depend on 
<br>whether he forges a compromise with Ayatollah Ali Akbar 
<br>Rafsanjani or continues to pull the "puppet strings" of 
<br>President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.  Al-Hadhoud said the Iranian 
<br>public, in staging mass protests in the wake of the 
<br>elections, had "crossed the fear line."  The next test for 
<br>Iran will be to face the future reactions of the Iranian 
<br>Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and to what extent the 
<br>IRGC, the Basij militia, and the regular army are ordered to 
<br>maintain security.  He questioned whether the IRGC would hold 
<br>ranks with Khamene'i or begin to sympathize with the Iranian 
<br>masses should further crackdowns be instigated, as happened 
<br>with the Iranian Army when it fractured and many joined the 
<br>mass student protests in the 1979 Islamic revolution. 
<br>Al-Hadhoud predicted that such a tripwire to tip the balance 
<br>would be the arrest of Presidential challenger Mir Housein 
<br>Mousavi.  The DCOS also mentioned Kuwaiti understanding that 
<br>Iran was supporting Shi'a in the Gulf and extremists in 
<br>Yemen.  GEN Petraeus asked for assistance in determining if 
<br>Iran was, in particular, supporting the al-Houthi in Yemen. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (S) GEN Petraeus assured the DCOS that the US military is 
<br>"very capable" and is fully prepared for various 
<br>contingencies should unrest escalate or Iran become more 
<br>unpredictable.  He added that the US military is assisting 
<br>Gulf states in shoring up ballistic missile and counter air 
<br>defenses, as well as early warning systems in the eventuality 
<br>of an Iranian missile launch.  He encouraged the GOK to 
<br>consider establishing a regional "Center for Excellence for 
<br>Air and Missile Defense," -- complementing the UAE's Gulf Air 
<br>Warfare Center -- which would focus on air and missile 
<br>defense and on the interoperability of systems such as the 
<br>PAC-III Kuwait now has deployed. 
<br> 
<br>Counterterrorism 
<br>---------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (S) GEN Petraeus congratulated the DCOS on the success of 
<br>GOK security forces in counterterrorism (CT) operations in 
<br>recent months, citing Kuwaiti crackdowns on individuals of 
<br>"mutual concern."  He conveyed to the DCOS that passage of 
<br>comprehensive CT legislation would greatly facilitate further 
<br>cooperation in this critical area.  General Petraeus observed 
<br>that Kuwait, based on its experience with extremists, should 
<br>recognize that such elements will ultimately turn to 
<br>targeting Kuwait. 
<br> 
<br>Mil-Mil:  Joint training and JMC 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (C) GEN Petraeus told the DCOS that the bilateral Defense 
<br>Cooperation Agreement (signed in 1991, renewed in 2001) had 
<br>proved mutually beneficial and that the USG is inclined to 
<br>renew it in 2011.  He also said that he was looking forward 
<br>to the October JMC to discuss with Kuwaiti COS LTG Fahad 
<br>al-Amir Kuwaiti concerns over the FMS program and the 
<br>possibility of creating a regional air and missile 
<br>defense center of excellence in Kuwait.  He also noted the 
<br>receipt and approval of a Kuwaiti request for an avionics and 
<br>weapon systems upgrade, and encouraged Kuwaiti participation 
<br>in joint military exercises like Eager Mace and Bright Star. 
<br>He also offered to help in the coordination of an Eagle 
<br>Resolve exercise, should the GOK desire to host it.  In 
<br>addition, he encouraged Kuwait to send its special operations 
<br>forces to Jordan's King Abdullah II Special Operations 
<br>Training Center and its fighter-attack aircraft to the UAE's 
<br>Gulf Air Warfare Training Center. 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (U) GEN Petraeus has cleared this cable.
