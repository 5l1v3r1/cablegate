<br>Classified By: Political Minister-Counselor Kathleen Allegrone, 1.4 (b/

<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: President Sarkozy's March 26-27 visits to 
<br>the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Republic of Congo 
<br>(ROC), and Niger were intended to promote democratic 
<br>principles, shared business interests, and, more generally, 
<br>Sarkozy's policy of moving away from the "France-Afrique" 
<br>model of managing relations to a more modern one based on 
<br>partnership, according to Presidential Deputy Diplomatic 
<br>Advisor Bruno Joubert on April 3. Joubert said that Sarkozy 
<br>had accomplished what he had set out to do and that the 
<br>Africans with whom he met better understood French policy 
<br>toward the region and where Sarkozy wants to take relations, 
<br>even if they were not completely comfortable with the new 
<br>paradigm. On the DRC and Rwanda, Joubert explained that 
<br>France wanted to promote cooperation between the two and 
<br>suggested starting with a number of small economic and 
<br>development projects that would show quick results and 
<br>encourage further cooperation. Joubert said that he planned 
<br>to travel to the U.S. during the April 14-15 period and hoped 
<br>to meet with officials at the Department (AF A/S-Designate 
<br>Carson), NSC (AF Senior Director Gavin), and USUN (PermRep 
<br>Rice). END SUMMARY.

<br>France-Afrique 
<br>-------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Rather than provide a narrative of Sarkozy's visit, 
<br>Joubert placed it within the context of France's evolving 
<br>Africa policy and its movement, under Sarkozy, away from the 
<br>classic colonial and post-colonial "France-Afrique" model and 
<br>towards a more modern relationship based on shared interests 
<br>and a partnership among equals (ref E-G). He said that the 
<br>visit, most notably as expressed in Sarkozy's speech before 
<br>the DRC parliament, was an extension of remarks that Sarkozy 
<br>had made in Cape Town in February 2008 on the need for 
<br>rational relationships free of the baggage of the past. 
<br>Joubert said that the new policy faced several challenges, 
<br>one of which he described as a predilection on the part of 
<br>the French public and press to view relations with Africa as 
<br>inherently "corrupt, sordid, and scandal-ridden." The public 
<br>and press often looked at Africa only from this angle. One 
<br>of Sarkozy's aims was to carry out a visit crisply, 
<br>efficiently, and transparently. He wanted to show that 
<br>France could deal with its African partners as 
<br>straightforwardly as it dealt with its other partners, and 
<br>Joubert deemed this aspect of the visit a success, even if 
<br>its briskness and openness left the press, critics, and some 
<br>Africans a bit perplexed. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Always seeking to put a negative light on relations, 
<br>some observers, while claiming to condemn "France-Afrique," 
<br>at the same time accused Sarkozy of trying to "rupture" 
<br>French relations with Africa. Joubert said that neither 
<br>Sarkozy nor anyone else speaking officially for France had 
<br>ever used the term "rupture." The move away from 
<br>"France-Afrique" was instead a "turning of a page" and a 
<br>shift in direction towards a more modern and balanced 
<br>relationship. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Thus partnership was an underlying theme of the 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00000504 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>visit. In Niger, for example, where French 
<br>extractive-industry giant AREVA and its activities were a 
<br>central element of the visit, Sarkozy stressed not only the 
<br>mutual benefits derived from AREVA's uranium operations but 
<br>also the other positive aspects of AREVA's presence in terms 
<br>of improved roads and infrastructure for the common good. 
<br>The same was true for AREVA's activities in the DRC. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Another theme was democracy and good governance, 
<br>with Joubert noting that France was unfairly accused of only 
<br>supporting "old regimes." Sarkozy's speeches in the DRC and 
<br>ROC stressed the need for both countries to adhere to 
<br>democratic principles and that these principles were not 
<br>something applicable only in the West. Joubert said that 
<br>Sarkozy's stop in Brazzaville had to be managed "delicately." 
<br>As also noted ref C, Sarkozy did not want to appear to be 
<br>campaigning for President Sassou Nguesso regarding elections 
<br>later in 2009, and Joubert pointed out that Sarkozy met with 
<br>opposition figures to underscore that point. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Asked how the press and Africans viewed the visit, 
<br>Joubert said that the press response was muted, in part 
<br>because the visit did not take place according to press 
<br>preconceptions. Joubert indicated that this was a positive 
<br>development insofar as the press was forced to think about 
<br>the visit. Joubert said that African leaders seemed to 
<br>understand what Sarkozy's approach represented in terms of 
<br>transparent, straightforward dealings, although they may not 
<br>have been completely comfortable with it. Speaking quite 
<br>candidly, Joubert said that "you have to understand, many of 
<br>these leaders, such as Sassou Nguesso, have grown up with 
<br>'France-Afrique.' When they used to meet with Chirac, it was 
<br>all backslapping, jokes, long leisurely meals, and plenty of 
<br>anecdotes about the old days, when they and Chirac were 
<br>younger and coming up together. Sarkozy isn't like that at 
<br>all; it takes some getting used to for some of them. There 
<br>were a few comments about why Sarkozy didn't at least spend 
<br>the night at each of his stops. They are beginning to see 
<br>that Sarkozy is not here to carry on the old backslapping 
<br>ways."
