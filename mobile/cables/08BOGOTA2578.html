<br>
<br>SUMMARY
<br>-------
<br>¶1. (C) Peace Commissioner Restrepo told us the GOC has
<br>reached out to establish direct contact with the FARC, but
<br>does not feel any pressure to move quickly on a peace
<br>process. The GOC believes Cano is isolated from other
<br>Secretariat members, and will continue military efforts to
<br>kill or capture him. Restrepo said the GOC must force Cano
<br>to understand that negotiations offer the only way out for
<br>the FARC (and for him); the GOC is prepared to provide Cano
<br>and other FARC leaders a "dignified" exit. Despite ruling
<br>out further international facilitation, Restrepo said the GOC
<br>could consider an international accompaniment or verification
<br>role once a serious process begins. The GOC remains willing
<br>to talk with the ELN, but sees little prospect as long as ELN
<br>leaders reside in Venezuela. End summary.
<br>
<br>FARC REJECTS GOC TALKS--SUGGESTS NICARAGUA
<br>------------------------------------------
<br>¶2. (U) The FARC Secretariat issued a letter June 26 that
<br>stated the group would not directly negotiate with the GOC,
<br>and instead wanted a meeting with Nicaraguan President Daniel
<br>Ortega to discuss "issues of war and peace." The letter,
<br>addressed to Ortega, thanked "Commandante Daniel" for his
<br>"support through these difficult moments" and for providing
<br>asylum to two FARC fighters brought to Nicaragua after the
<br>March 1 attack against FARC number two Raul Reyes in Ecuador.
<br>In a July 5 communique, the Secretariat admitted that the
<br>GOC's July 2 rescue of 15 hostages was a "reversal," but
<br>insisted the group would continue its fight. The Secretariat
<br>reiterated its interest in a humanitarian exchange of
<br>"political" hostages for FARC members captured by the GOC,
<br>but did not mention its long-standing demand that talks on
<br>such an exchange be conditioned on the GOC's demilitarization
<br>of Pradera and Florida municipalities.
<br>
<br>GOC REMAINS READY TO TALK
<br>-------------------------
<br>¶3. (C) Peace Commissioner Luis Carlos Restrepo told us July
<br>11 that the GOC remains committed to pursuing direct talks
<br>with the FARC and has reached out to FARC leader Alfonso Cano
<br>(reftel). If the FARC responds positively to the GOC
<br>overture, the GOC will send an emissary to lay the groundwork
<br>for an eventual FARC-Restrepo meeting. The GOC would not
<br>insist on a FARC release of hostages as condition for talks,
<br>because the GOC knows the FARC would not accept this. Still,
<br>Restrepo said the GOC does not feel any need to move quickly
<br>on talks with the group. Instead, it will try to establish
<br>contact and allow Cano to analyze his deteriorating
<br>situation. Restrepo stressed that the GOC will continue
<br>military operations to kill or capture Cano. The GOC needs
<br>to force Cano to understand that talks are the FARC's (and
<br>his) only way out.
<br>
<br>INTERNAL FARC PROBLEMS AS OBSTACLE
<br>----------------------------------
<br>¶4. (C) Restrepo said Cano remains isolated, and has little
<br>support from, or contact with, other members of the
<br>Secretariat. The isolation creates opportunities that the
<br>GOC may be able to exploit, especially if military pressure
<br>can further break FARC command and control systems. The GOC
<br>is prepared to offer Cano and other FARC leaders a
<br>"dignified" way out of the armed struggle, but does not want
<br>to fall into the trap of allowing the FARC to use peace talks
<br>to rebuild its military capacity. Restrepo said a major
<br>obstacle to a successful peace process is Cano's continued
<br>commitment to a "Leninist" approach to politics.
<br>
<br>GOC: POSSIBLE FUTURE ROLES FOR INTERMEDIARIES
<br>--------------------------------------------- -
<br>¶5. (C) The GOC does not need or want international or
<br>domestic facilitators with the FARC, but has not ruled out a
<br>future international "accompaniment" or verification role if
<br>the FARC begins to negotiate in good faith. Restrepo said
<br>that Operation "Checkmate" freed the GOC from French and U.S.
<br>pressure to advance on an humanitarian accord. He added that
<br>Alvaro Leyva, Carlos Lozano, Frenchman Noel Saenz, and Swiss
<br>
<br>BOGOTA 00002578 002 OF 002
<br>
<br>
<br>Jean Pierre Gontard had not been reliable facilitators.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Restrepo said the French accepted the GOC 's
<br>revocation of their facilitation role with more grace than
<br>the Swiss, who insisted on continued engagement. On June 15,
<br>Prosecutor General Mario Iguaran announced an investigation
<br>against Gontard for allegedly carrying $500,000 in cash for
<br>the FARC. The Swiss Foreign Ministry issued a press release
<br>on July 14 denying the charges and calling on the GOC to
<br>"cease its attacks" against Gontard.
<br>
<br>GOC: ELN INCAPABLE OF TAKING DECISION ON PEACE
<br>--------------------------------------------- --
<br>¶7. (C) Vice Minister of Defense Sergio Jaramillo told us a
<br>successful peace process with the ELN remains impossible,
<br>because ELN leaders lack the capacity to take decisions and
<br>do not control the group's armed fronts. The ELN remains
<br>weak militarily, but some fronts in Arauca, Cauca, and Narino
<br>have strengthened due to their heavy involvement in
<br>narcotrafficking. Jaramillo said the ELN is better than the
<br>FARC at political organizing, but added that its leaders do
<br>not have a vision of what role they might play in a
<br>democratic Colombia.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Restrepo said key ELN leaders view Colombian
<br>realities through a Venezuelan lens and therefore feel little
<br>pressure to move on peace. Moreover, they will not enter
<br>into a peace process that is not linked to the FARC.
<br>Restrepo said ELN fronts cooperate with the FARC on
<br>narcotrafficking in some areas, and maintain a political
<br>profile in Arauca, Catatumbo, Narino, and southern Choco due
<br>to narcotrafficking. ELN leaders continue to pursue their
<br>old strategy of seeking contact with civil society and the
<br>international community instead of with the GOC. Still,
<br>Restrepo said the GOC would meet with the ELN if an
<br>opportunity presented itself--a scenario which would likely
<br>only occur if ELN leaders were forced to leave Venezuela.
