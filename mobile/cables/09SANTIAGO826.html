<br>
<br>REF: 08 SANTIAGO 856
<br>
<br>Classified By: A/DCM Laurie Weitzenkorn for reason 1.4 (B).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Despite sensationalist press coverage and a
<br>popular image of bloody conflict in Chile's southern Mapuche
<br>heartland, poloffs found that relations between indigenous
<br>and non-indigenous communities were largely non-violent, if
<br>often tense and distrustful. Three people -- all Mapuche
<br>activists -- have died in the so-called Mapuche conflict over
<br>the past ten years. Arson, vandalism, and peaceful protests
<br>and non-violent activism have been far more common.
<br>Opposition politicians have alleged links between the Mapuche
<br>and foreign terrorist organizations FARC and ETA, but
<br>government officials downplay these connections as mere
<br>"guerrilla tourism." End Summary.
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) Poloff and Pol Specialist traveled to the heart of
<br>Chile's Mapuche territory, the regions of Araucania and Los
<br>Rios, August 10-14. This trip happened to coincide with the
<br>death of a Mapuche activist, Jaime Mendoza, at the hands of a
<br>police officer in a conflict in Araucania on August 12,
<br>further focusing domestic political attention on Mapuche
<br>unrest. This is the first in a series of cables based on
<br>meetings with urban and rural Mapuche community members,
<br>government officials, church leaders, academics and civil
<br>society members during this trip. Septels will describe
<br>Mapuche demands and human rights issues.
<br>
<br>"Araucania in Flames" and Other Sensationalism
<br>--------------------------------------------- -
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) A casual observer of Chilean news coverage could be
<br>forgiven for thinking that violent Mapuche activists with
<br>strong and active links to the FARC and ETA are killing
<br>innocent civilians each week in the so-called "Mapuche
<br>conflict." Opposition presidential candidate Sebastian
<br>Pinera has declared that "Araucania is in flames." Chile's
<br>major newspapers, which are generally conservative in their
<br>political outlook, frequently run reports of conflict related
<br>to indigenous concerns prominently on the front page.
<br>Destruction of property -- which accounts for the vast
<br>majority of all illegal Mapuche action -- is often displayed
<br>in full color and with bold headlines, sometimes beating out
<br>coverage of more severe crimes committed by non-indigenous
<br>Chileans. Moreover, positive or less incendiary news from
<br>indigenous communities -- resolution of localized conflicts,
<br>peaceful protests, meetings, or other actions taken to
<br>address Mapuche political concerns -- are often not covered
<br>at all.
<br>
<br>Conflicts Over Ancestral Lands
<br>------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) Unsurprisingly, conflicts over ancestral lands are
<br>the most frequent flash point for clashes. The Chilean
<br>government's colonization policy of the late 1800s, known as
<br>the "Pacification of the Araucania," led to the first real
<br>conquest of Mapuche territory, which had never been under
<br>Spanish control. Mapuches were pushed off the best
<br>agricultural lands, which the Chilean government auctioned
<br>off. Land reforms in the 1960s and 70s benefited Mapuche
<br>communities as well as other landless farmers, but were
<br>largely rolled back under Pinochet. Preparation for the
<br>return to democracy led to a new deal between then candidate
<br>Patricio Aylwin and indigenous communities in 1989. Aylwin's
<br>victory was followed by a new indigenous law in 1993 that
<br>included mechanisms for transferring indigenous land back to
<br>indigenous communities. However, the ensuing 16 years have
<br>brought slow progress on land acquisitions and transfers,
<br>contributing to a Mapuche vision of 100 years of broken
<br>promises from the Chilean state.
<br>
<br>Social Protest or Domestic Terrorism?
<br>-------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) In contrast to the sensationalist news coverage,
<br>the reality of relations between the indigenous Mapuche
<br>community, their non-indigenous neighbors, and the Chilean
<br>state is complex and sometimes contentious, but
<br>overwhelmingly non-violent. While the Chilean public
<br>associates Mapuches with rural areas of Araucania and
<br>neighboring regions, 70% of Mapuche live in urban areas.
<br>Santiago is home to more Mapuches than any other region.
<br>Confrontations between Mapuches and others in Santiago are
<br>rare, and many Mapuches go about their daily lives without
<br>highlighting their ethnic background. Outside of Santiago
<br>
<br>SANTIAGO 00000826 002 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>many Mapuche communities have peaceful but tense relations
<br>with their neighbors and the Chilean government. Frustration
<br>and distrust are common, particularly in rural communities in
<br>the regions of Bio Bio, Araucania, and Los Rios. Some
<br>communities are engaged in non-violent activism.
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) According to Interior Under Secretary Patricio
<br>Rosende, 27 of Chile's 2,100 Mapuche communities are actively
<br>in conflict with landowners or the Chilean government. Eight
<br>of those 27 conflicts have turned violent. Since 1990, when
<br>the Mapuche community began pressing the newly democratic
<br>state for more rights and restitution of ancestral lands,
<br>three people have died as a direct result of the Mapuche
<br>conflict. All of the deaths have been young Mapuche
<br>activists killed by Chilean police: Alex Lemun, a 17-year
<br>old killed in 2002; Matrias Catrileo, a 23-year old killed in
<br>January 2008; and Jaime Mendoza, a 24-year old killed on
<br>August 12, 2009.
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) While violence targeting people remains rare,
<br>vandalism and destruction of property are more common
<br>techniques used by communities in conflict. A single piece
<br>of land, owned by Rene Urban but claimed by Mapuche
<br>communities, has been occupied by Mapuche activists 62 times,
<br>and has been subject to arson and other forms of property
<br>destruction. Frequent attacks against property and
<br>investment projects contribute to the lack of economic
<br>development in the zone. Araucania has the highest poverty
<br>and unemployment rates in the nation. The president of the
<br>Temuco Agricultural Promotion Society recently told the
<br>press, "No one in his right mind would invest today in
<br>Araucania."
<br>
<br>"Guerrilla Tourism" or Expanding Terrorist Networks?:
<br>Alleged Links to FARC and ETA
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) In meetings with Poloff August 24 and 20, both
<br>Rosende and National Prosecutor's Office International
<br>Affairs Director Jorge Chocair played down allegations of
<br>ties between Mapuches -- particularly the often violent group
<br>Coordinadora Arauco Malleco (CAM) -- and foreign terrorist
<br>organizations like the FARC or ETA. Yes, some CAM members
<br>have traveled to Colombia, Spain, and southern Mexico, and
<br>may have even participated in some training camps run by
<br>these foreign organizations, they said. A handful of
<br>representatives from Askapena, ETA's political arm, visited
<br>Mapuche communities in August 2009. However, Rosende and
<br>Chocair both characterized these relationships as relatively
<br>casual and infrequent, with Chocair describing it as
<br>"guerrilla tourism:" traveling to rebel-held areas of a
<br>third country for photos and meetings with little follow up.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Rosende and Chocair both claim that the CAM barely
<br>exists now, thanks to a number of high-profile arrests of
<br>alleged CAM leaders. (Note: A September 1 press report
<br>alleges that the CAM is recruiting urban Mapuches to assume
<br>leadership roles in the organization. End note.) Jaime
<br>Lopez, an Araucania-based public defender specializing in
<br>Mapuche defendants, expressed his doubts to Poloffs on August
<br>11 that the CAM was ever a terrorist organization, noting
<br>that three successive court cases failed to demonstrate that
<br>they had organized any terrorist activity.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) In contrast to these views from administration
<br>officials, opposition leaders -- including presidential
<br>candidate Sebastian Pinera -- have sought to emphasize the
<br>connections between the Mapuche and terrorist organizations.
<br>During an August 19 meeting with Poloffs, Senator Alberto
<br>Espina stated that the Interior Ministry has evidence of FARC
<br>links to Chile, including dates and routes of travel for 8-10
<br>Mapuche individuals who attended FARC training camps. (Note:
<br>Reftel describes Pinera and Espina's role in publicizing a
<br>May 2008 Colombian intelligence report alleging links between
<br>FARC rebels and Chilean communists, Mapuche activists, and
<br>others in Chile. End note.)
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) COMMENT: Disagreements between the Mapuche
<br>community, non-Mapuche landowners, and the Chilean state are
<br>serious and merit attention. At a minimum, such conflict
<br>traps indigenous and non-indigenous community members alike
<br>in a cycle of distrust, hindering economic development in the
<br>region and preventing the full inclusion of Mapuches in
<br>Chilean society. However, even with the most recent death of
<br>a young Mapuche activist, the large-scale violent unrest that
<br>many Chileans project on the region is overblown. Similarly,
<br>despite vocal allegations in the press, the opposition has
<br>
<br>SANTIAGO 00000826 003 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>yet to produce credible evidence that there is significant
<br>and on-going cooperation between the Mapuche community and
<br>FARC and ETA terrorists. END COMMENT.
