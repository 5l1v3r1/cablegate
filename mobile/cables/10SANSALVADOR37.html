<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Eight months into the Funes presidency, the GOES 
<br>can best be characterized as schizophrenic.  The part of the 
<br>government that Funes controls is moderate, pragmatic, responsibly 
<br>left-of-center and friendly to the USG.  The part he has ceded to 
<br>hard-line elements of the (left-wing) Farabundo Marti National 
<br>Liberation Front (FMLN) is seeking to carry out the Bolivarian, 
<br>Chavista game-plan, including implacable hostility towards the USG. 
<br>Divisions on the right have given the FMLN a dominant position in 
<br>the Legislative Assembly.  However, the FMLN does not have an 
<br>outright majority in the legislature, and it faces strong 
<br>opposition in the popular and independent-minded President Funes. 
<br>Funes's popularity could erode quickly if his administration does 
<br>not start showing visible results in reducing violent crime and 
<br>reviving the economy.  The government's long-run inability to 
<br>tackle crime or produce economic growth, coupled with petty 
<br>infighting and corruption within the country's political parties, 
<br>raises questions about the future of democratic governance in El 
<br>Salvador.  End summary. 
<br>

<br> 
<br>FUNES-FMLN RELATIONS STRAINED BUT CIVIL 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S) The FMLN's relationship-of-convenience with Mauricio Funes 
<br>has soured since the March 2009 election.  Early in his tenure, 
<br>Funes surrounded himself with centrist advisors and laid out a 
<br>moderate, pro-U.S. foreign policy - moves FMLN hardliners saw as an 
<br>attempt to distance himself from their influence.  Recognizing 
<br>Funes's popularity and needing his support, the FMLN sought subtle 
<br>ways to challenge Funes's independence.  Starting in September 
<br>2009, FMLN hardliners within Funes's cabinet (most notably Vice 
<br>President and Education Minister Salvador Sanchez Ceren) gave 
<br>anti-American speeches, announced El Salvador's intention to join 
<br>ALBA, and made high-profile visits to Cuba and Venezuela - each 
<br>action carefully choreographed to defy Funes's agenda but with the 
<br>pretense that the officials were acting as FMLN representatives, 
<br>not as members of the Funes government (see reftel A).  Meanwhile, 
<br>Public Security Minister Manuel Melgar has sought to politicize the 
<br>National Civilian Police (PNC) and the FMLN has used its 
<br>"territorial" ministries (Labor, Health, Education and Gobernacion) 
<br>to extend their geographic and bureaucratic hold over the GOES. 
<br>Funes advisors told us the FMLN may have also used their control of 
<br>the Salvadoran intelligence agency to bug phones in the Casa 
<br>Presidencial (see reftel B).  Thus far, however, the two sides 
<br>continue to cooperate on issues of mutual interest, including the 
<br>budget and tax reform passed in December. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) While the Funes-FMLN conflict would appear to benefit the 
<br>right, internal divisions there have prevented the (center-right) 
<br>National Republican Alliance (ARENA) from mounting a serious 
<br>opposition.  Since October, thirteen legislative deputies and 
<br>scores of mayors and local party functionaries have left ARENA, 
<br>most of them joining the newly-formed Grand Alliance for National 
<br>Unity (GANA) (see reftel C).  ARENA leaders blame these defections 
<br>on former president Antonio Saca, whom the party expelled from its 
<br>ranks in December 2009.  While not officially a member of any 
<br>party, Saca is widely rumored to be the inspirational and financial 
<br>force behind GANA. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) This crisis has not only dashed ARENA's hope of forming a 
<br>majority alliance in the Legislative Assembly, it has also called 
<br>into question the identity of the party, for years considered one 
<br>of the most well-organized and ideologically-unified in Latin 
<br>America.  Still, XXXXXXXXXXXX told 
<br>PolOff that the crisis has galvanized the party's base, which XXXXXXXXXXXX 
<br>says is "angry as hell" at Saca and the GANA "traitors."  According 
<br>to XXXXXXXXXXXX, in February ARENA plans to roll out a Contract with 
<br>America-style publicity campaign that will emphasize "center-right 
<br>pragmatism" and distance the party from President Saca's corrupt 
<br>legacy.  XXXXXXXXXXXX said that ARENA president Alfredo Cristiani has 
<br>instructed party leaders to focus their criticism on the FMLN and 
<br>avoid attacking GANA or President Funes, both of which ARENA views 
<br>as potential allies.  Until the 2012 legislative elections, 
<br> 
<br>however, ARENA will remain a marginalized force in national 
<br>politics. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) Aside from the FMLN and ARENA, the country's other political 
<br>parties are small, weak, and ideologically malleable.  Their only 
<br>real selling points are as coalition partners providing the final 
<br>votes on closely fought legislation.  Neither the FMLN nor ARENA 
<br>can achieve a legislative majority without the support of GANA or 
<br>the (opportunist) National Conciliation Party (PCN).  In recent 
<br>months, the FMLN has teamed with both GANA and the PCN to reshuffle 
<br>the legislature's leadership positions and pass a contentious tax 
<br>increase (see reftels D and E).  Given their strategic positions, 
<br>GANA and the PCN will likely remain major players in legislative 
<br>battles ahead, demanding, as they were rumored to have done in 
<br>their previous votes with the FMLN, political favors and covert 
<br>payments in exchange for their support.

<br>Funes's Challenges: Crime and the Economy 
<br> 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) Public security ranks atop most polling on the nation's 
<br>priorities, particularly after a 37 percent increase in homicides 
<br>in 2009.  Despite great efforts, successive administrations have 
<br>failed to make much of a dent in the intractable street-gang 
<br>problem, so Funes's team will need to be both creative and 
<br>ambitious in its approach to make any headway.  So far, they have 
<br>been neither.  Funes's most significant public security reform to 
<br>date has been a temporary deployment of troops to patrol high-crime 
<br>areas (see reftel F) which news reports suggest may have moderately 
<br>reduced crime in those areas since the November 2009 deployment. 
<br>However, the constitution limits such deployments to six months, 
<br>and Funes has yet to propose reforms to the GOES security apparatus 
<br>that would make those gains sustainable.  He has not moved to 
<br>provide the National Civilian Police (PNC) with significant 
<br>increases of badly-needed personnel, equipment and training, nor 
<br>sought institutional changes in PNC culture, that will result in 
<br>more effective law enforcement and crime control. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) The other major concern for the GOES is the sluggish 
<br>economy, which continues to feel the effects of the global 
<br>financial crisis and the recession in the U.S.  According to the 
<br>GOES, GDP declined 3.5 percent in 2009 and is projected to grow 
<br>less than 1 percent in 2010 - its worst two-year performance since 
<br>¶1992.  Unfortunately, Funes has few options available to stimulate 
<br>a recovery: the GOES has limited funds for countercyclical fiscal 
<br>activity, even with President Funes's modest tax increase, and 
<br>dollarization rules out monetary stimulus.  Funes and his economic 
<br>team understand the importance of free-market incentives, but have 
<br>been anemic in their efforts to attract private investment. 
<br>Ultimately, powerful trade and remittance relationships mean that 
<br>the Salvadoran economy will only recover following a sustained 
<br>economic recovery in the U.S. 
<br>

<br>Comment 
<br> 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (C) GANA's threat to ARENA now appears more serious than it did 
<br>at first.  GANA has poached dozens of ARENA-loyalists in recent 
<br>weeks and has demonstrated through an extravagant convention and a 
<br>subsequent publicity campaign that it has the deep pockets to put 
<br>up a real fight.  Whispers within ARENA also suggest GANA's 
<br>critique of ARENA's elitism has struck a chord among mid-level 
<br>party functionaries, many of whom secretly sympathize with GANA 
<br>despite remaining within ARENA.  ARENA's rebound depends on 
<br>recuperating financing, which it lost when it became an opposition 
<br>party without GOES patronage to hand out.  It still represents the 
<br>only organized force capable of confronting the growing influence 
<br>of the FMLN. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C) Funes's ego has little chance of rapprochement with the 
<br>hard-line FMLN.  If things continue to deteriorate, we could see an 
<br>open break between the two sides, possibly resulting in a new 
<br> 
<br>alliance between Funes and an existing party (perhaps the 
<br>center-left Democratic Change (CD)) for the 2012 legislative 
<br>elections.  Funes would then need to shake up his cabinet and seek 
<br>right-of-center allies in the Legislative Assembly to pass his 
<br>agenda.  The FMLN response would be ugly - massive street protests, 
<br>labor strikes, road blockages, threats of violence, legislative 
<br>logjams - and paralyze some government operations and place a 
<br>further drag on the struggling economy. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (C) The GOES's inability to make gains in public security, 
<br>continued anemic growth and the disintegration of the right taken 
<br>together present a challenging road ahead for democracy in El 
<br>Salvador, especially if coupled with a Funes-FMLN split.  Funes's 
<br>persistent high popularity ratings, now well over 80 percent, make 
<br>it too soon to sound the alarm, but democratic institutions are 
<br>vulnerable.  Sanchez Ceren's recent call for sweeping 
<br>constitutional reforms to institute "participatory democracy" is a 
<br>timely reminder that the hard-line FMLN's threat to Salvadoran 
<br>democracy is real.  The Embassy, allied with civil society, will 
<br>continue to engage and support moderates in the GOES while working 
<br>with democratic forces across the political spectrum to strengthen 
<br>Salvadoran constitutional institutions.
