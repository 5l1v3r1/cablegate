<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Kosovo celebrated the second anniversary of its 
<br>independence on February 17. These two years have seen political 
<br>stability that has allowed the country to create legitimate new 
<br>institutions, including the Constitutional Court and the Kosovo 
<br>Security Force, and to start fulfilling its Ahtisaari Plan 
<br>obligations, such as decentralization. Challenges remain, and 
<br>Pristina and the international community must focus on moving the 
<br>country towards eventual membership in the Euro-Atlantic 
<br>institutions that will act as a guarantor of Kosovo's viability and 
<br>security. Progress towards European Union membership and a role 
<br>within NATO will require a concerted focus on building institutions, 
<br>strengthening the country's system of justice, protecting its 
<br>multi-ethnicity, and developing its economy. In each of these 
<br>fields, Kosovo has been active in laying foundations for progress. 
<br>However, we cannot ignore that work remains. Political parties need 
<br>to move beyond their regional bases for support and cooperate better 
<br>in pursuit of national goals. The GOK, with more effective support 
<br>from EULEX, needs to build on its initial reforms in the justice 
<br>sector and intensify its anti-corruption efforts. Pristina, with 
<br>the help of the international community, wants to replicate the 
<br>success of decentralization in southern Kosovo that empowers Serb 
<br>communities and extend the same hope to northern Kosovo, where 
<br>Belgrade maintains an illegal stranglehold on municipal governance. 
<br>The GOK must use its string of economic reforms and privatizations 
<br>as a springboard to motivate private-sector growth. Eventual 
<br>membership in the European Union and other Euro-Atlantic 
<br>institutions will mitigate the challenge that Kosovo's small size 
<br>poses. The largest threats to this agenda come both from Belgrade 
<br>and the risk that Brussels will not use its influence there to 
<br>compel Belgrade's greater cooperation in allowing Kosovo to develop 
<br>and strengthen. END SUMMARY 
<br>
<br>KOSOVO AT TWO YEARS 
<br>------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) The Republic of Kosovo turned two years old on February 17. 
<br>It has been two years marked by a number of successes. Most 
<br>notably, we have seen peace and government stability. Kosovo has 
<br>taken responsibility for ensuring its own democracy with elections 
<br>that it ran on its own for the first time since the end of the 
<br>conflict. Serbs in southern Kosovo participated in these elections 
<br>and are starting to accept that their survival runs through Pristina 
<br>rather than Belgrade. More Serbs, in fact, cast ballots in Kosovo's 
<br>municipal elections in November 2009 than in the illegitimate 
<br>parallel elections for local Serbian institutions that took place 
<br>throughout the year. New institutions, like the Constitutional 
<br>Court, are standing up and starting to earn respect as legitimate 
<br>bodies. Internationally, Kosovo has secured membership in both the 
<br>World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and recognitions of 
<br>Kosovo's independence now stand at 65 countries. At the 
<br>International Court of Justice, Kosovo (supported by many in the 
<br>international community, including the United States) presented a 
<br>strong case to challenge Belgrade's contention that the country's 
<br>independence fails to accord with international law, and we expect 
<br>that even an ambiguous opinion from the Court will open the door for 
<br>more states to recognize the country's independence. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) In short, Kosovo has much to celebrate on its independence 
<br>day. We must not forget, however, that Kosovo is a nascent state 
<br>that still confronts challenges. Its stability is laudable, but 
<br>its political scene is fractious as inexperienced political parties 
<br>tend to elevate narrow interests above national goals. The legacy 
<br>of conflict and socialism has weakened its institutions, and its 
<br>economy remains a work in progress. Kosovo continues to look to the 
<br>international community for guidance, and it sees in this advice a 
<br>path that will lead to eventual membership in the Euro-Atlantic 
<br>community of nations, an end-goal that will act as a guarantor of 
<br>the country's independence, viability, and stability. In helping 
<br>Kosovo ultimately realize both European Union and NATO membership, 
<br>we need to focus our efforts in fostering the state's institutions, 
<br>developing the rule of law, promoting its multi-ethnicity, and 
<br>strengthening its economy. 
<br>
<br>BUILDING INSTITUTIONS 
<br>
<br>PRISTINA 00000084 002.2 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>--------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) Kosovo's two largest parties -- the Democratic Party of 
<br>Kosovo (PDK) and the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) -- have 
<br>coexisted in stable government since national elections in November 
<br>¶2007. This stability has allowed the GOK to focus on several 
<br>post-independence institution building projects: embarking on 
<br>decentralization, standing up the Kosovo Security Force (KSF), and 
<br>creating the Constitutional Court, among others. The results have 
<br>been positive. We have seen Serbs turnout in large numbers to elect 
<br>Serb candidates for mayor and municipal assemblies in the new, 
<br>Ahtisaari-mandated, Serb municipalities. The KSF has broken ties 
<br>with the legacy of the Kosovo Liberation Army and is showing a 
<br>commitment to becoming a multi-ethnic force with its new pan-Kosovo 
<br>recruitment campaign. The Constitutional Court has earned 
<br>legitimacy as the final arbiter of elections-related disputes. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) The stability allows us to focus on critical economic 
<br>projects -- like the New Kosovo Power Plant and the privatization of 
<br>the state telecom, Post and Telecom of Kosovo -- with a stable 
<br>government partner focused on work rather than campaigning. It also 
<br>gives us time to encourage Kosovo politics to move beyond its 
<br>post-conflict paradigm, when all parties focused on independence to 
<br>the exclusion of other considerations. Left-right policy dimensions 
<br>do not yet exist here. The large political parties have not yet 
<br>developed policy platforms that extend beyond reaffirming promises 
<br>to their core supporters. The LDK still sees itself as the 
<br>standard-bearer for late President Ibrahim Rugova. The PDK and the 
<br>Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) are outgrowths of the KLA 
<br>and continue to appeal to regional support bases. These lingering 
<br>identities too often obfuscate priorities and encourage leaders, at 
<br>times, to forget that national interests must take precedence. 
<br>
<br>IMPORTANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) On February 16, President Sejdiu appointed new Supreme 
<br>Court judges and prosecutors. This action builds on a years-long, 
<br>continuing process of vetting for professional competence judges and 
<br>prosecutors. The vetting process involves both Kosovo and 
<br>international community arbiters, and the GOK's full acceptance of 
<br>the results shows a commitment to developing an independent 
<br>judiciary that will start to fill the gaps that exist in Kosovo's 
<br>rule-of-law institutions. A similar process of interviews and 
<br>testing went into the selection of the Constitutional Court justices 
<br>last year, and we have seen this court grow in legitimacy over the 
<br>past several months. It has already had its own minor Marbury v. 
<br>Madison moment, exercising unchallenged authority over legislation 
<br>that controls the funding of the state radio and television 
<br>broadcaster. Although the ruling has invited critics and 
<br>controversy, none of these critics has questioned the role that the 
<br>Court has played. This is a significant step in shoring up the 
<br>independence of the country's judicial institutions. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) There remains a need for more progress. In January of this 
<br>year one of Kosovo's most widely read newspapers noted in an 
<br>editorial that Kosovo's system of justice needs deep reform. The 
<br>GOK, too, recognizes that it faces a challenge in developing its 
<br>legal institutions, and the Prime Minister has adopted a legislative 
<br>strategy for the year that prioritizes the rule of law. It is a 
<br>strategy that will modernize and reform the court structure, 
<br>invigorate the country's prosecutorial ranks, and create an 
<br>institutional foundation where objectivity has an opportunity to 
<br>flourish. Concurrent with this legislative strategy, the GOK -- 
<br>with more active assistance from EULEX -- will need to strengthen 
<br>its anti-corruption efforts, a difficult challenge in a country this 
<br>small, where businesses often claim a political patron. Despite the 
<br>inherent difficulties, our institution-building efforts must 
<br>prioritize the rule of law and the fight against corruption. The 
<br>public needs to feel confident that laws apply to everyone. EULEX 
<br>needs to step up its activity and deliver long-promised arrests of 
<br>high-ranking corrupt public officials, or we run a risk that our 
<br>rule-of-law reforms will fall flat and leave the public with a 
<br>perception that the government is little more than a kleptocracy. 
<br>
<br>A MULTI-ETHNIC STATE 
<br>
<br>PRISTINA 00000084 003.2 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>-------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU) Kosovo has made a strong start in fulfilling its promises 
<br>under the Ahtisaari plan to empower Serb communities. Serb mayors, 
<br>following municipal elections in November 2009, now hold office in 
<br>the new municipalities of Gracanica, Klokot, and Ranilug. In 
<br>Strpce, a pre-existing municipality where the Serb majority refused 
<br>to participate in the November 2007 elections, a new legitimate Serb 
<br>mayor has taken significant steps to undo the influence of the 
<br>illegal parallel municipal government that answers to Belgrade. In 
<br>Pristina, the central government is devolving more authority to all 
<br>municipalities, giving local residents a louder voice in shaping 
<br>their communities' future. Most refreshing is that that the GOK 
<br>continues to focus on these Serb communities, providing them with 
<br>significant new resources in the 2010 budget that will allow them to 
<br>strengthen the new municipal structures and develop their 
<br>infrastructure. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (SBU) In northern Kosovo the challenges surrounding integration 
<br>are greater. Belgrade's legitimacy outstrips Pristina's in the 
<br>northern municipalities of Leposavic, Zubin Potok, and Zvecan, but 
<br>it may not be as unchallenged as Belgrade would like us to think. A 
<br>municipal preparation team (MPT) is now working in the planned new 
<br>municipality of North Mitrovica, which will hold a special election 
<br>later this year to select its inaugural government. This MPT is the 
<br>GOK's first step in building on the success of its decentralization 
<br>efforts in the South. It has adopted a comprehensive approach to 
<br>the North that entails an incremental "hearts and minds" campaign to 
<br>win greater support from northern Serbs to work with Kosovo 
<br>institutions. The illegal parallel institutions that control the 
<br>North are little more than fronts for organized crime, and the 
<br>region has become stagnant. The Serbs north of the Ibar River 
<br>consistently point to the absence of the rule of law there, and this 
<br>could prove to be the tool that begins their acceptance of Pristina 
<br>-- if the GOK and EULEX, together, can make meaningful progress in 
<br>shutting down the criminal networks that dominate throughout the 
<br>North. Pristina can offer hope, but it cannot achieve success on 
<br>its own. The Europeans need to contribute. EULEX needs to crack 
<br>down on organized crime, and Brussels must use the lure of EU 
<br>integration to compel Belgrade to play a helpful role in returning 
<br>law and order to northern Kosovo. Pristina cannot return hope to 
<br>the North if the international community will not stop Belgrade from 
<br>interfering in the region's development. 
<br>
<br>ECONOMIC REFORMS AND PRIVATE SECTOR GROWTH 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶10. (SBU) At the central level Kosovo has laid a strong foundation 
<br>for economic reforms. In recent months the Assembly has adopted a 
<br>debt law that sets rational limits on the amount of debt that the 
<br>country can incur and should allow Kosovo to pursue a sovereign 
<br>credit rating that will permit it to finance its development. The 
<br>IMF has provided guidance on a Central Bank law that will both 
<br>strengthen the institution and open opportunities for more 
<br>development assistance. And, the GOK is demonstrating an ever 
<br>improving control of its budgetary process, delivering a 
<br>comprehensive and reasonable 2010 budget to the Assembly that 
<br>prioritizes critical needs. Amid these steps, privatization 
<br>continues. The GOK hosted a pre-bid conference for representatives 
<br>from three pre-qualified consortia interested in entering into a 
<br>public-private partnership for the Pristina Airport which we expect 
<br>will attract a 100 hundred million Euro investment, with a contract 
<br>awarded in April. Further cause for optimism is on the near horizon 
<br>with the upcoming privatization of the Kosovo Energy Corporation and 
<br>development of a new 500MW power plant that will put an end to the 
<br>rolling blackouts that still affect the country. When this plant 
<br>comes online, industry will find a more inviting environment for 
<br>setting up business. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (SBU) These important steps do not mask Kosovo's current 
<br>economic woes that leave many Kosovars without work. With an 
<br>unemployment rate of greater than 40 percent, the economy is 
<br>suffering. There is little industry, the private sector is 
<br>underdeveloped, and the country's greatest natural resource -- 
<br>lignite -- is underutilized due to a dilapidated power 
<br>infrastructure. At present, the government remains the primary 
<br>
<br>PRISTINA 00000084 004.2 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>engine that drives the economy, a model that is not sustainable. 
<br>Government contracts for road-building projects help to provide 
<br>temporary employment, but they do not offer the longer term economic 
<br>stability that the country requires. In the coming years, both the 
<br>government and the international donor community need to redirect 
<br>their efforts towards projects that will spark greater dynamism and 
<br>diversity within the private sector. The central reforms that have 
<br>occurred -- and will continue throughout the rest of the year -- 
<br>provide hope that Kosovo will soon feature a strong economic 
<br>framework where private sector growth will necessarily follow. 
<br>
<br>EURO-ATLANTIC INSTITUTIONS 
<br>-------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶12. (SBU) Kosovo's small size presents a challenge for its survival, 
<br>a challenge that the international community can help surmount with 
<br>its Euro-Atlantic institutions. The lure of these institutions -- 
<br>in particular, the European Union and NATO -- are tantalizing 
<br>opportunities that focus the attention of the GOK. With a small 
<br>population where family and klan ties provide dominant affiliations, 
<br>Kosovo is susceptible to corruption that will retard development. 
<br>On the security front, Kosovo is currently a NATO protectorate, but 
<br>those forces are beginning to withdraw, and Kosovo leaders are 
<br>wondering whether or not the small (no more than 2500 active members 
<br>according to the Ahtisaari Plan) and lightly armed Kosovo Security 
<br>Force (KSF) can fill the void that KFOR will leave. The antidote 
<br>for both of these problems is membership within the European Union 
<br>and NATO, and this Euro-Atlantic orientation is the primary issue 
<br>that unifies the country's dueling political forces around a core 
<br>national vision. 
<br>
<br>¶13. (SBU) Prime Minister Thaci, daily, expresses his commitment to 
<br>readying Kosovo for EU consideration, and he regards the next 
<br>European Union Progress Report on Kosovo, due in June, with a mix of 
<br>anxiety and optimism. He wants to show the electorate that his 
<br>leadership is bringing Kosovo closer to Brussels, and he wants to be 
<br>the person who brings EU visa liberalization to Kosovo. Over the 
<br>longer term, the country needs EU membership as an outlet for its 
<br>young workforce and as a unified market for exports. It also needs 
<br>to define its future relationship with NATO. Every Kosovar desires 
<br>full membership in an institution second only to the United States 
<br>in the hagiography of Kosovo's recent history. The limitations that 
<br>the Ahtisaari Plan places on the Kosovo Security Force are going to 
<br>prove contentious over time, especially once KFOR withdraws 
<br>completely. Without an agreed and viable connection to NATO, we run 
<br>the risk that unofficial militias will again develop out of fear 
<br>that the country is unable to defend itself from aggression. 
<br>
<br>COMMENT: 
<br>-------- 
<br>
<br>¶14. (SBU) Kosovo's independence has been a success story. The worst 
<br>fears -- large scale population movements and outbreaks of violence 
<br>-- following February 17, 2008, never materialized. The political 
<br>scene, while fractious, works together on the big issues, like 
<br>decentralization and establishing new institutions. The 
<br>international community and the Kosovars, themselves, can feel good 
<br>about the positive steps that have occurred over the past two years, 
<br>but we cannot ignore the challenges that remain. With each passing 
<br>day we need to see the GOK take more responsibility for securing the 
<br>country's future -- more activity on lobbying for recognitions, more 
<br>temperate political debate, greater respect for the rule of law, and 
<br>a concerted focus on national interests -- but there remains an ever 
<br>present role for the international community. Pristina cannot yet 
<br>extend its authority across its entire territory. The International 
<br>Steering Group on February 8 gave its blessing to a comprehensive 
<br>approach that will bolster Pristina's presence in the North, but 
<br>this approach will also require international support. Indeed, each 
<br>of the steps towards Kosovo's eventual membership in the European 
<br>Union will require international attention, and we need to make sure 
<br>that Brussels gives Pristina the same consideration that it pays to 
<br>Belgrade. Above all, the progress that Kosovo makes in overcoming 
<br>the challenges it confronts should play the determining role in the 
<br>country's qualifications for European Union and NATO membership. We 
<br>need to keep the GOK's focus squarely on its responsibilities while 
<br>reminding our European partners that they too have a role to play.
