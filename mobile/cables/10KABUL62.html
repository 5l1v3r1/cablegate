<br>
<br>Classified By: Polcouns Annie Pforzheimer, reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)
<br>
<br>¶1.  Summary:  (C) President Karzai has appointed a new mayor
<br>of Kabul, Engineer Mohammad Yunos Novandish. This follows the
<br>December 7, 2009 'mismanagement of authority' conviction and
<br>the December 8, 2009 release pending appeal of former Kabul
<br>Mayor Abdul Ahad Sahebi (Reftel.)  The Novandish appointment
<br>portends controversy because he is not from Kabul; the Sahebi
<br>case suggests kangaroo court justice. Bio information on
<br>Novandish is in paras 3 and 4.  End Summary.
<br>
<br>--------------------
<br>New Mayor - Old Ties
<br>--------------------
<br>
<br>¶2.  (C) President Karzai issued a January 3 decree appointing
<br>Engineer Mohammad Yunos Novandish  the new mayor of Kabul.
<br>Controversy over the appointment may arise for two reasons:
<br>First, according to Article 141 of the Constitution, mayors
<br>shall be elected, not appointed. Some Afghan MPs went on TOLO
<br>TV January 5 to challenge the appointment on constitutional
<br>grounds.   Second, according to embassy contacts among the
<br>National Democratic Front (NDF), Mayor Novandish is not a
<br>native Kabuli and the NDF is planning to try and organize
<br>protests within the month. (Note:  The NDF is a loosely
<br>organized coalition of urban civil society groups and members
<br>of parliament.)
<br>
<br>¶3.  (U)  According to media reports and embassy contacts,
<br>Novandish, an Uzbek from Saripol, graduated from the
<br>engineering faculty of Kabul Polytechnic University in civil
<br>engineering and did post-graduate studies in the Ukraine.  He
<br>served as a lecturer at Balkh University from 1994 to 1996,
<br>lived primarily in Central Asia during the Taliban years, and
<br>was Deputy Minister of Water and Energy from 2004-2006.
<br>Novandish resigned his post when Ismail Khan was appointed
<br>Minister of Water and Energy. After 2006 he worked as a
<br>consultant for USAID-funded programs such as International
<br>Development Relief and Development, Inc. (IRD) and Advanced
<br>Engineering Institute Associates (AEIA).  In 2009 he opened
<br>his own engineering firm, Energy and Power Construction
<br>Company, which has allegedly done extensive subcontracting
<br>work in the energy sector. (Note: alternate transliterations
<br>of his name include Noandesh, Novandesh, and Nawandaish.)
<br>
<br>¶4.  (S/NF)  Sensitive reporting indicates that warlord and
<br>leader of the Junbesh Party General Dostum pushed Novandish
<br>for the Kabul Mayor appointment.  Although Novandish claims
<br>publicly that he is politically independent, this reported
<br>Dostum support has credibility given that Novandish was
<br>Deputy Minister of Water and Energy when current MP and
<br>Junbesh Party member Shakar Kargar (Uzbek, Jowzjan) was
<br>Minister.  Kargar reportedly owed his own ministerial
<br>appointment at that time to Dostum. Although Kargar is an
<br>intra-party rival of Dostum, they often unite to further
<br>party interests.  Dostum has been publicly vocal in his
<br>criticism of the January 2 ministerial confirmation process
<br>in which all three Junbesh nominees were rejected.  The
<br>appointment of an apparent Dostum supporter to the mayor's
<br>office may well be President Karzai's attempt to placate
<br>Dostum and Junbesh.
<br>
<br>----------------------------
<br>Old Mayor - Yesterday's News
<br>----------------------------
<br>
<br>¶5.  (C)  Media coverage of the new mayor's appointment has
<br>included condemnation of his predecessor, Abdul Ahad Sahebi,
<br>for "massive embezzlement of funds and brazen misuse of
<br>authority."  The ex-mayor's December 7 conviction and almost
<br>immediate release from jail on bail pending appeal generated
<br>a media frenzy and intense speculation over President
<br>Karzai's role in Sahebi's release. (Reftel.)  USG officials
<br>met with Sahebi on December 25, 2009 and January 2 and 3,
<br>¶2010.  Sahebi produced the December 6 summons he received to
<br>appear at primary court and obtain a date for his preliminary
<br>hearing.  Sahebi contended that normal procedure requires a
<br>minimum of 5 days between summons and hearing date, but when
<br>he presented himself to the court on December 7, his lawyer
<br>was handed not a hearing date, but his sentence - four years
<br>in jail and a USD 16,000 fine.
<br>
<br>¶6.  (C)  Concerning the actual charge of poor oversight of
<br>contracting authority, Sahebi laid out his version of the
<br>case:  In 2007 Sahebi's predecessor signed a one-year
<br>contract leasing some city property to two individuals who
<br>had shops on the site.  When the contract came up for
<br>renewal, the City Hall financial department assigned three
<br>people to study the continued use of the land.  The financial
<br>department recommended the contract be renewed, with mention
<br>of the city's future plans for the site.  Sahebi's deputy
<br>
<br>KABUL 00000062  002.2 OF 002
<br>
<br>signed the renewal.  Three months later, a higher bid for the
<br>site came in.  Had that bid been accepted, the city would
<br>have gained about USD 16,000 more for the lease and this
<br>"loss" was the basis of the case against him.  Embassy
<br>officials have not been privy to the prosecution's case
<br>against Sahebi.
<br>¶7.  (C)  Regarding his job perfomance, Sahebi also mentioned
<br>to USG officials that in his less than two years as mayor he
<br>had found files for approximately 32,000 applicants who paid
<br>for non-existent plots of land in Kabul city.  He said he
<br>ordered a halt to the distribution of residential and
<br>commercial land until claims could be sorted out and
<br>invalidated the illegal claims of some important people like
<br>Engineer Ahmed Shah, who is close to the fundamentalist
<br>former warlord MP, Rasoul Sayyaf (Pashtun, Kabul).  This
<br>claim supports information reported reftel that some of
<br>Sahebi's official decisions may have antagonized powerful
<br>people who then sought to use the power of the state to
<br>discredit him.
<br>
<br>------------------------------
<br>Karzai's Motives Still Unclear
<br>------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶8.  (C)  Comment: Metaphorically speaking (there is no jury
<br>trial in Afghanistan) the jury is still out on Sahebi, the
<br>first high-profile case of official corruption following
<br>Karzai's re-election.  Sahebi's case is on appeal, but no
<br>hearing date has been set.  Unfortunately for the former
<br>mayor, he has already been tried in the press and condemned
<br>as an embezzler, a charge that apparently was not even
<br>brought and for which we have seen no evidence.  As for the
<br>formal process itself, it appears that Sahebi may have been
<br>convicted without having been accorded what little due
<br>process there is under Afghan law.
<br>
<br>¶9.  (C)  The Novandish appointment may indicate that Karzai
<br>concluded, despite his initial forceful defense of Sahebi,
<br>that it was more politically expedient to sacrifice him.
<br>Karzai may hope both to satisfy international expectations
<br>that he will act to clean up his government and at the same
<br>time to placate powerful Afghan players who wanted the
<br>ex-mayor gone for their own mercenary reasons.  End Comment.
