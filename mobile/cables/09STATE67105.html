<br>
<br>¶2. (U) Iraq - Paragraphs 7-11

<br>
<br>¶4. (U) Key Concerns - Paragraphs 24-43

<br>¶6. (U) Suspicious Activity Incidents - Paragraphs 58-64
<br>
<br>¶7. (U) Iraq
<br>
<br>¶8. (S//NF) Alleged plans by various insurgent groups to
<br>conduct attacks during anticipated U.S. military withdrawal
<br>from urban areas: According to recent multiple source
<br>reports, various insurgent groups and militias intend on
<br>attacking multiple venues throughout Iraq in anticipation of
<br>U.S. military forces withdrawal from urban areas. Specific
<br>targets mentioned included the International Zone (IZ),
<br>Victory Base Complex, joint security stations, and various
<br>forward operating bases in Baghdad and in Maysan Province
<br>(southern Iraq). Allegedly, insurgent groups also are
<br>prepared to target key infrastructure, such as bridges and
<br>major supply routes used by Coalition forces (CF) and Iraqi
<br>Security Forces (ISF) convoys. According to one source, an
<br>unidentified group had access to a large tank of chlorine, 16
<br>V-8 rockets, and three torpedoes which were supposedly
<br>recovered by the CF and ISF. The reports mentioned the
<br>attacks would commence on or about July 1. The Government of
<br>Iraq is anticipating the offensive and has placed ISF units
<br>on alert and cancelled all leave effective June 28.
<br>
<br>¶9. (S//NF) DS/TIA/ITA would like to note  the series of
<br>reports are consistent with other recent threat reporting
<br>indicating the possibility of insurgent groups and militias
<br>preparing to increase attacks in anticipation of troop
<br>withdrawal from urban areas. It is possible that
<br>extremist-affiliated groups would seek to target the IZ and
<br>the Victory Base Complex, as the venues are symbolic of the
<br>U.S. diplomatic and military presence in Iraq. It is also
<br>plausible the groups may surmise that a large attack against
<br>CF troops in these areas would be ideal, as it would serve as
<br>propaganda for them, allowing them to take credit for driving
<br>out "occupying forces."
<br>
<br>¶10. (S//NF) DS/TIA/ITA would also highlight the allegation of
<br>the existence of the weapons cache, as the materials could
<br>possibly be used as components for improvised rocket-assisted
<br>munitions or an improvised explosive device (IED). According
<br>to the Multi-National Forces in Iraq Combined Intelligence
<br>Operations Cell, the first documented chlorine attack
<br>occurred in al-Anbar Province (western Iraq) on October 21,
<br>2006, and the first documented chlorine vehicle-borne IED
<br>(VBIED) in the Baghdad area occurred in Taji on February 20,
<br>¶2007. Despite the claims by insurgent groups and militias of
<br>chlorine-related attacks, their incident rates remain low and
<br>inconsistent. While DS/TIA/ITA cannot corroborate the
<br>veracity of the recent threat reporting, overall, there is
<br>nothing to suggest that the intention to attack the U.S.
<br>presence in Iraq will subside once a military troop
<br>withdrawal is completed. (Appendix sources 1-7)
<br>
<br>¶11. (SBU) Indirect fire (IDF) of unknown size was launched
<br>against the IZ in Baghdad at 9:22 p.m. on June 24. The IDF
<br>impacted in the river approximately 250 meters south of the
<br>U.S. Embassy compound. No injuries or damages were reported.
<br>(RSO TOC Baghdad Spot Report)
<br>
<br>¶12. (U) Significant Events
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) WHA Honduras - Honduran military forces arrested
<br>President Manuel Zelaya June 28 according to orders issued by
<br>the National Congress and the Supreme Court of Honduras.
<br>Zelaya was taken to a local air force base and flown to Costa
<br>Rica. Emergency Action Committee (EAC) Tegucigalpa
<br>subsequently met to discuss the ramifications of the seizure
<br>of the president by host-cost country military forces. The
<br>RSO noted the general climate in the capital was calm;
<br>however, a standfast order was issued, and additional
<br>security measures were implemented. The Embassy released a
<br>Warden Message regarding the actions against Zelaya and urged
<br>AmCits to remain in the residences or hotels for the day.
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) Later in the day, Congress officially named Roberto
<br>Micheletti interim president. The U.S. Ambassador gave a
<br>press conference outside the Embassy; he insisted that
<br>President Zelaya was the only democratically elected
<br>president of the country and urged that freedom of expression
<br>and circulation be restored. He also demanded the release of
<br>those government officials said to be in military custody.
<br>The EAC reconvened to assess the situation. Protest activity
<br>has centered around the presidential palace, some roads in
<br>the capital were blocked, and there were some troops on the
<br>street. However, traffic flow was reported normal in most of
<br>the city. Authorized Departure for family members was
<br>discussed, but not warranted at this time. Embassy personnel
<br>were advised to remain in their homes for the rest of the day
<br>and to limit their movements today, June 29. All Peace Corps
<br>volunteers have been accounted for and are on standfast. Post
<br>will be open today for emergency services only. The EAC will
<br>continue monitoring events in-country and provide updated
<br>information as available. (Tegucigalpa Spot Report; telcon;
<br>Warden Message; Appendix sources 8-10)
<br>
<br>¶15. (SBU) EUR Germany - A Local Guard Force (LGF) member of
<br>U.S. Consulate General Frankfurt discovered two suspicious
<br>cases with protruding wires June 26 while on foot patrol in
<br>the clustered housing area. The guard notified his
<br>supervisor, and the area and two nearby apartment buildings
<br>were evacuated. Responding police requested canine and
<br>Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) support. After the EOD team
<br>arrived, a local telecom technician, who had been working
<br>nearby, arrived at the scene and claimed the unattended
<br>cases; the technician had inadvertently left the cases. After
<br>further investigation and corroboration with the technician,
<br>police declare the area safe. (RSO Frankfurt Spot Report)
<br>
<br>¶16. (SBU) AF Liberia - Two acts of vandalism were reported to
<br>U.S. Embassy Monrovia on the night of June 27. One took place
<br>at the residence of the chief of the DoD Office of Security
<br>Cooperation, approximately 2.5 miles from Post, where
<br>graffiti was spray painted on the perimeter wall stating,
<br>"COL THE WAR HAS JUST BEGAN." The second incident occurred at
<br>the facility of a USAID-funded project, approximately 1.5
<br>miles from the Embassy, where the messages "INTERCON MUST
<br>LEAVE NOW, TAKE INT" and "DANGER" were spray painted on the
<br>compound wall. The RSO assesses these incidents are
<br>consistent with the pattern of threats and intimidation used
<br>by dismissed Embassy guards to obtain a favorable settlement
<br>with their former employer through the Liberian Ministry of
<br>Labor. (RSO Monrovia Spot Report)
<br>
<br>¶17. (SBU) Mauritania - U.S. Embassy Nouakchott received a
<br>credible threat June 27 regarding a kidnapping against an
<br>American in the capital sometime during the night (NFI). The
<br>RSO considers the information credible and made notifications
<br>to staff to assure that all official Americans were accounted
<br>for. All residential LGF posts were manned, and radio checks
<br>were increased. Post also issued a Warden Message advising
<br>AmCits in-country of the threat. Please see the Key Concerns
<br>section for further information. (RSO Nouakchott Spot Report)
<br>
<br>¶18. (C//NF) Mauritania - EAC Nouakchott met June 26 to
<br>discuss developments surrounding the murder of an unofficial
<br>American on June 23. Members were updated on the
<br>investigative progress of local authorities. The EAC reviewed
<br>the U.S. Embassy's tripwires for consideration of Authorized
<br>Departure and/or drawdown and determined there was
<br>insufficient information at this time to recommend either
<br>action. EAC members were reminded of the importance of random
<br>arrival arrivals at Post (effective June 25) along with other
<br>augmented security measures.
<br>
<br>¶19. (S//NF) The EAC reconvened June 28, and members were
<br>introduced to FBI assets assigned to investigate the AmCit's
<br>murder with host-country law enforcement personnel. Members
<br>welcomed the team and support their efforts on the
<br>investigation while in-country. Members also discussed the
<br>credible kidnapping threat against an AmCit in-country and
<br>reviewed the enhanced security measures already in place.
<br>Post issued a Consular short message system alert to the
<br>American community advising of the threat. The EAC will
<br>continue to review all threat information as it becomes
<br>available, while supporting the ongoing murder investigation,
<br>and the EAC will reconvene as needed. (Appendix sources 11-12)
<br>
<br>¶20. (SBU) Sudan Update - On June 24, verdicts were issued in
<br>the trial of the five Sudanese men charged with the January
<br>1, 2008, murder of U.S. Embassy Khartoum employees John
<br>Granville and Abdelrahman Abbas. Four of the defendants were
<br>found of guilty of intentional killing and sentenced to death
<br>by hanging. The fifth defendant was found guilty on weapons
<br>charges and sentenced to two years in prison, including
<br>credit for time served since his January 2008 arrest.
<br>(Khartoum 0790)
<br>
<br>¶21. (SBU) The Gambia - EAC Banjul met June 23 for its monthly
<br>meeting. It was determined that the recent activity in
<br>Tehran, Iran, should not present any additional danger for
<br>U.S. personnel or citizens in-country; however, the EAC
<br>agreed U.S. Embassy staff must be more diligent in practicing
<br>common-sense security measures. EAC members deemed Post's
<br>current security posture is sufficient. (Banjul 0190)
<br>
<br>¶22. (S//NF) NEA Yemen - EAC Sana'a met June 28 to discuss a
<br>write-in threat concerning a VBIED attack against the U.S.
<br>Embassy planned for today, June 29. The threat was traced to
<br>Algeria, and, although such threats are considered relatively
<br>common, Post officials are taking the threat seriously.
<br>Members agreed that Post's current security upgrades were
<br>sufficient to deter and, if need be, withstand an attack;
<br>however, members deemed it would be prudent to request
<br>additional security from the Republic of Yemen Government at
<br>Post's perimeter, in light of the approaching July 4 holiday.
<br>Please see the Key Concerns section for further details.
<br>(Appendix source 13)
<br>
<br>¶23. (C) SCA Bangladesh - U.S. Embassy Dhaka officials met
<br>with the secretary of Home Affairs to discuss concerns over
<br>an uptick in crimes directed against foreigners in Dhaka's
<br>Diplomatic Enclave. The secretary stated the Government of
<br>Bangladesh (GoB) had increased the police presence in the
<br>enclave May 7, when threat letters were sent to several
<br>diplomatic missions. Post officials will continue to monitor
<br>the situation and keep pressure on the GoB to provide
<br>adequate security to the U.S. Mission. (Appendix source 14)
<br>
<br>¶24. (U) Key Concerns
<br>
<br>¶25. (S//NF) AF Mauritania - AQIM threat to kidnap American
<br>citizen: According to the Spanish National Intelligence
<br>Service (CNI), an unidentified source for the CNI service
<br>center stated al-Qa'ida in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb
<br>(AQIM) planned to kidnap an unidentified AmCit in Nouakchott
<br>during the evening of June 27. According to the report's
<br>context statement, a CNI official provided the information
<br>during the course of a routine liaison meeting. There are no
<br>additional details on this information, and the report's
<br>originators are unable to assess the reliability of the
<br>ultimate source(s) of the information. In addition, it is not
<br>known what, if any, vetting or validation procedures the
<br>Spanish service may use to evaluate its sources. In separate
<br>reporting, AQIM, as of late June, had sent three unidentified
<br>members to Mauritania from northern Mali to conduct
<br>operations against government interests in Nouakchott and
<br>Nouadhibou, according to the Mauritanian External
<br>Intelligence Service. It was unknown, according to the
<br>Mauritanian service, whether AQIM intended to attack
<br>Mauritanian and/or foreign government facilities in those
<br>cities. Separately, AQIM Tariq Ibn Ziyad battalion leader
<br>'Abd al-Hamid (Abu Zaid), as of late June, had delayed an
<br>order for four men to travel to Nouakchott to conduct
<br>unspecified operations, according to the Mauritanian service.
<br>DS/TIA/ITA notes the latest threat information follows last
<br>week's killing of an American in Nouakchott and the possible
<br>involvement of AQIM. (Appendix sources 15-16)
<br>
<br>¶26. (S//NF) Nigeria - Extremists believed to be planning a
<br>massive terrorist attack: (S//REL TO USA, FVEY) Tearline
<br>states, "Unspecified extremist groups, suspected to be
<br>operating in concert with Nigerian Shi'ites, Salafiya, or
<br>Muhammad Yusuf's Nigerian Taliban are reportedly planning to
<br>launch a massive surprise attack on some piece of critical
<br>infrastructure or against high-profile targets within
<br>Nigeria. Probable targets of this attack include top Nigerian
<br>Government officials or security agents. Members of the
<br>general public, who might be opposed to the attackers'
<br>doctrines, were also believed to be possible targets. This
<br>planned attack is reportedly aimed at sparking sectarian
<br>clashes across Nigeria."
<br>
<br>¶27. (S//NF) DS/TIA/ITA cannot immediately corroborate the
<br>current threat with additional intelligence. While no
<br>connection can be made between this threat and previous
<br>reports, DS/TIA/ITA is concerned about recent activity
<br>surrounding extremists associated with the Nigerian Taliban.
<br>
<br>¶28. (S//NF) A well-trained veteran Chadian extremist,
<br>Abu-Mahjin (Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE)
<br>number 24350378), who has limited ties to al-Qa'ida
<br>associates, recently traveled to Nigeria. He may be planning
<br>to conduct or facilitate a terrorist operation. Indeed,
<br>tearline from May 1 claimed, "An Islamic extremist named
<br>Abu-Muhjin has recently been in northeast Nigeria. It is
<br>likely that he will be joined by other Islamic extremists in
<br>the coming weeks." More recent tearline stated,
<br>"Nigerian-based probable Chadian extremist Abu-Mahjin is keen
<br>to obtain more funds in connection with some sort of
<br>nefarious activity (possibly terrorism related) he is engaged
<br>in. However, it is not clear when he will receive this
<br>additional finance." Little more is known about Abu-Mahjin's
<br>apparent efforts to organize a near-term operation.
<br>
<br>¶29. (S//NF) Though neither the Nigerian Taliban nor its more
<br>militant subset -- Tanzim al-Qa'ida group -- has ever
<br>attacked Western interests, they have discussed targeting
<br>foreign embassies in the past. In 2007, they reportedly
<br>plotted to attack the U.S., British, and Israeli embassies in
<br>Abuja, according to a single source that remains
<br>unsubstantiated. (Appendix sources 17-19)
<br>
<br>¶30. (C//NF) NEA Algeria/Yemen - Unsubstantiated threat
<br>claiming suicide bombing against U.S. embassies: On June 26,
<br>a write-in to a USG website provided a message involving an
<br>unsubstantiated threat to U.S. embassies in Algiers, Algeria,
<br>and Sana'a, Yemen. The message was posted in Arabic and
<br>appeared to originate in Algeria. The writer warned of a "big
<br>attack against your embassies in Algeria and Yaman by suicide
<br>car on 29/06/2009" and claimed to be an agent of the Algerian
<br>Intelligence Service. The writer provided an apparent
<br>telephone number for confirming his information and warned,
<br>"The second attack what you will see it is in Hassi Messaud
<br>in Sahara by a big number of terrorists." The report's
<br>originators note that they have no further information to
<br>corroborate the information, and the source may have intended
<br>to annoy, mislead, or disrupt rather than to provide
<br>legitimate information. The originators further note that the
<br>vast majority of such information is not true, but, since
<br>volunteers have provided authentic leads on occasion, the
<br>information is provided for evaluation purely due to its
<br>threat content. (Appendix source 20)
<br>
<br>¶31. (S//NF) Yemen - Al-Qa'ida possibly planning Embassy
<br>attacks: (S//REL TO USA, FVEY) According to tearline
<br>information, "Saudi authorities learned in late June that
<br>al-Qa'ida may be planning an attack on Western and Middle
<br>Eastern embassies in Yemen. There was no additional
<br>information on the timing or exact location of the planned
<br>attack."
<br>
<br>¶32. (S//NF) DS/TIA/ITA notes this report is likely related to
<br>recent information provided by a Yemeni security official in
<br>late June regarding possible unspecified al-Qa'ida in the
<br>Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) attacks against the embassies of the
<br>U.S, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and
<br>unnamed European nations in Sana'a. No further information
<br>was provided on this general threat report.
<br>
<br>¶33. (S//NF) DS/TIA/ITA also notes the continuing AQAP threat
<br>to Western and host-nation interests both in Sana'a and
<br>throughout Yemen. Previous AQAP attacks illustrate a
<br>willingness and capability to target Western citizens and
<br>diplomatic facilities, highlighted by the brazen attack
<br>against U.S. Embassy Sana'a in mid-September 2008. The lack
<br>of host-nation political will to combat AQAP contributes to
<br>an extremely permissive operating environment for extremist
<br>elements, suggesting threat reporting against U.S. and other
<br>foreign interests in Yemen will continue in both the near and
<br>medium term. (Appendix sources 21-22)
<br>
<br>¶34. (S//NF) SCA Afghanistan - Threat to unspecified American
<br>in Kandahar: As of late June, Kandahar Taliban members Sadiq,
<br>Mullah Hamdullah, and Qari Yousef intended to kidnap an
<br>unspecified American who travels from Kandahar Airfield to
<br>work in Kandahar city to hold for ransom. The kidnappers
<br>planned to use a local Afghan who the American trusted to
<br>place a substance in his food to render him unconscious.
<br>Hamdullah, a.k.a. Bari Alai, worked under the command of
<br>Mullah Faizel who was currently in detention at Guantanamo
<br>Bay.
<br>
<br>¶35. (S//NF) While the Taliban operatives named in this report
<br>are indeed active in and around Kandahar city to include
<br>involvement in kidnapping plots, DS/TIA/ITA questions the
<br>source's access to operational plans by the Taliban. In past
<br>reporting, the source has reported primarily on Taliban
<br>member atmospherics and movements in southern Afghanistan and
<br>only occasionally on threats. DS/TIA/ITA assesses information
<br>provided by the source regarding the January 2008 kidnapping
<br>of an American non-governmental organization (NGO) worker to
<br>be inaccurate.
<br>
<br>¶36. (S//NF) That said, periodic reporting indicates
<br>extremists remain keen to abduct another Westerner in
<br>Kandahar city, possibly while traveling to/from Kandahar
<br>Airfield. Tearline states, "Taliban insurgents reportedly
<br>planned in late January to kidnap a U.S. national as he
<br>traveled between Kandahar Airfield and Shur Andam Pass,
<br>Kandahar Province." Reporting from November 2008 alleged the
<br>Taliban planned to kidnap two foreign women possibly from
<br>their residence in northeast Kandahar city or at the Rang
<br>Rezano market they frequented.
<br>
<br>¶37. (S//NF) Mullah Faizel (variants: Faisal, Fazilfazul; TIDE
<br>number 72569) was being held at Guantanamo Bay as of early
<br>April 2008. Mullah Hamdullah (possible TIDE number 75483) is
<br>characterized in late-2008 sensitive reporting as a group
<br>commander of a large number of Taliban in Helmand Province.
<br>The same report noted Sadiq, the brother of the Taliban's
<br>second-in-command Mullah Berader (TIDE number 76541), worked
<br>at an unnamed U.S. NGO and was involved in planning an
<br>unspecified kidnapping. (Appendix sources 23-30)
<br>
<br>¶38. (S//FGI//NF) Pakistan - Militants may be planning to
<br>abduct U.S. and UK citizens from NGOs and consulates;
<br>dual-citizens in Peshawar: Tearline intelligence reports,
<br>"Militants attached to Pakistan's Mumtaz Group may be
<br>planning to kidnap U.S. and UK citizens working in NGOs and
<br>consulates, as well as dual-citizen Pakistanis who are either
<br>visiting or residing in Peshawar, as of June 26. Peshawar's
<br>University Town could be the likely venue for such an
<br>operation. Further, the following individuals who probably
<br>reside in (the) Peshawar area could be supporters of the
<br>Mumtaz Group: Fahim, son of Ihsanullah; Ayaz; Abdul Rehman
<br>Khan (Awami National Party) and his son, Yunas Khan,
<br>residents of Kafir Dheri, Peshawar; Garib Shah Badshah; and
<br>Muazzam Badshah, son of Shah Badshah."
<br>
<br>¶39. (S//FGI//NF) DS/TIA/ITA assesses the Mumtaz Group may be
<br>a reference to operations linked to al-Qa'ida leader Hamza
<br>al-Jawfi (a.k.a. Mumtaz; TIDE number 70390) who died in a
<br>late-February explosion in North Waziristan. Mumtaz is an
<br>oft-used alias by senior al-Qa'ida leaders that is arguably
<br>inauspicious. The now-deceased Hamzah Rabi and Abu Khabab
<br>al-Masri both used this alias as well. Worryingly, the other
<br>operatives DS/TIA/ITA suspects belong to this group are
<br>linked to ongoing, credible planning against Peshawar
<br>cantonment as well as American personnel and convoys
<br>belonging to U.S. Consulate Peshawar.
<br>
<br>¶40. (S//FGI//NF) Although al-Jawfi is dead, it is possible
<br>the operations referenced can be linked to al-Jawfi's former
<br>courier and Imran (TIDE number 14399906), who collaborates
<br>closely with Mohmand Agency-based Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan
<br>(TTP) commander Hakimullah Mahsud. Early-April reporting from
<br>Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) links Imran -- described as
<br>an Uzbeki militant responsible for the November 12, 2008,
<br>murder of a USAID contractor and the August 26, 2008, ambush
<br>of the principal officer's (PO's) vehicle in Peshawar -- to
<br>TTP operative Faruq's ongoing planning for an attack on
<br>Peshawar's cantonment using multiple suicide operatives.
<br>Faruq is also likely involved in conducting al-Qa'ida-linked
<br>operational surveillance against the PO of U.S. Consulate
<br>Peshawar, a four-vehicle SUV protective convoy, and a vehicle
<br>workshop also affiliated with Post. Of note, however, ISI
<br>reported the capture of an individual named Imran in
<br>mid-June; although, it cannot be confirmed if this is the
<br>same Uzbeki Imran mentioned in earlier reporting. (Appendix
<br>sources 31-38)
<br>
<br>¶41. (S//FGI//NF) Pakistan - Threats against Punjab and
<br>Islamabad: Reporting continues to circulate detailing ongoing
<br>plans by Pakistani extremists to launch suicide operations in
<br>Punjab Province and Islamabad. In Islamabad, threats specify
<br>the targeting of embassies located in the F-6/2 sector,
<br>police post Aabpara in Islamabad, the Imam Bargah in G-6/2,
<br>Senator Tariq Azim, and Barri Imam Shrine. In Lahore and
<br>greater Punjab Province, suicide operatives may seek to
<br>strike against foreigners in crowded areas or the Barbar Data
<br>Sahib Shrine. Although it remains unclear if these named
<br>targets are an accurate reflection of extremists' operational
<br>plans, it is of note late-June reporting also mentions the
<br>cultivation and use of sympathetic madrassas and extremists
<br>located in targeted cities to carry out future attacks.
<br>
<br>¶42. (S//NF) As of late June, TTP reportedly tasked Abdul
<br>Malik Mujahid to launch suicide attacks against unspecified
<br>foreigners in crowded places in Punjab, with Mujahid
<br>considering the use of sympathetic madrassas as shelter prior
<br>to conducting an attack. Madrassas under consideration
<br>included the Jami Ashrafia and Jamiat ul-Manzur ul-Islami in
<br>Lahore. Separately, tearline from late June reports,
<br>"Militant commander Khan Bahadur, son of Sher Bahadur, is the
<br>local militant commander in the Watkai area. Bahadur
<br>currently may be residing in Islamabad, while reorganizing
<br>his group to operate in difference parts of Pakistan, as of
<br>June 25." Although there is limited information regarding the
<br>identity of Khan Bahadur (possible TIDE number 238258),
<br>earlier sensitive intelligence suggests he has served as an
<br>interlocutor in urban areas for Waziristan-based militants
<br>since 2007. According to late-January 2008 tearline, "... A
<br>Khan Bahadur (or Bhadur) in Lahore was involved in efforts to
<br>arrange talks and perhaps a government announcement for a
<br>cease-fire and helping coordinate a separate announcement
<br>from the Mujahidin, hopefully by October 13...."
<br>
<br>¶43. (S//FGI//NF) As underscored by the events during and
<br>following the Lal Masjid (Red Mosque) confrontation in
<br>Islamabad in July 2007, the continued existence of networks
<br>in Islamabad that can organize and facilitate protests and
<br>terrorist activity in the vicinity of the capital is indeed
<br>troubling. Notably, a body of intelligence reporting
<br>preceding the Lal Masjid confrontation suggests
<br>Pakistan-based extremists viewed the brewing tension between
<br>the madrassas and Islamabad one part of a larger
<br>comprehensive effort to re-energize and expand their jihadi
<br>operations from their strongholds in the tribal areas and
<br>Northwest Frontier Province. Interestingly, reporting from
<br>May 2007 citing a commander 10 corps lieutenant also noted 70
<br>mosques in and around Islamabad would likely support
<br>extremist activity associated with the now-infamous Lal
<br>Masjid, which was also an unauthorized mosque. Of concern,
<br>since 2008 attacks in Pakistan have repeatedly targeted
<br>Westerners, coinciding with an unprecedented number of
<br>attacks in both Lahore and Islamabad. (Appendix sources 39-47)

<br>¶44. (U) Cyber Threats
<br>
<br>¶45. (U) EUR CTAD comment: The latest version of the National
<br>Security Strategy released by the UK Government includes a
<br>public cyber security strategy. The report calls for the
<br>establishment of two new offices with cyber security
<br>responsibilities and approves the use of offensive operations
<br>as a countermeasure to attacks against British systems. The
<br>Office of Cyber Security, falling under the Cabinet Office,
<br>will be the central body charged with coordinating with
<br>industry and developing strategy. The Cyber Security
<br>Operations Centre based at Government Communications
<br>Headquarters, the UK's primary signals intelligence agency,
<br>will be responsible for conducting offensive operations.
<br>According to press reports, the UK Government has hired
<br>several former hackers to staff the centre.
<br>
<br>¶46. (S//NF) NEA CTAD comment: DoD reporting indicates as of
<br>mid-May, several Persian-language hacker forums are sharing
<br>information pertaining to a variety of hacking codes, tools,
<br>and video tutorials. One of the more notable findings was a
<br>PHP-based "simattacker code" -- a backdoor Trojan horse
<br>program that allows for remote exploitation of an affected
<br>system and can provide denial-of-service capabilities. This
<br>particular malicious code is reportedly similar to a tool
<br>used against Georgian systems in 2008 (NFI).
<br>
<br>¶47. (SBU) EAP CTAD comment: According to South Korean press
<br>reporting, the Republic of Korea's (RoK's) Defense Security
<br>Command (DSC) has declared intrusion attempts against the
<br>RoK's military computer networks have increased 20 percent in
<br>2009, compared to those detected in 2008. The DSC further
<br>stated that 89 percent of the attempts are unsophisticated
<br>efforts to hack into servers and Internet homepages, whereas
<br>the remaining 11 percent appear to be more advanced attempts
<br>to obtain intelligence information. Of note, in an effort to
<br>deal with the increasing cyber threat, the RoK's National
<br>Intelligence Service has recommended President Lee Myung-bak
<br>appoint an aide to assist with the country's cyber security
<br>issues.
<br>
<br>¶48. (S//NF) SCA CTAD comment: According to Defense
<br>Intelligence Agency reporting, the Government of India (GoI)
<br>continues efforts to advance its computer security programs
<br>-- particularly in light of increased concerns over Chinese
<br>computer network exploitation efforts -- but progress is
<br>hampered by significant disagreements within its departments.
<br>The key GoI organizations involved in developing and
<br>implementing security policies are identified as the Ministry
<br>of Telecommunications and the Research and Analysis Wing.
<br>Although the Indian Army is primarily responsible for the
<br>security of military networks, Indian officials acknowledge
<br>Army representatives have been largely left out of
<br>discussions. Additionally, some other key groups, such as the
<br>National Technical Reconnaissance Organization and the Indian
<br>Defense Intelligence Agency, have reportedly failed to offer
<br>significant contributions. Private security companies are
<br>also concerned that the lack of input from the private sector
<br>may lead to unfair regulations regarding telecommunications
<br>monitoring.
<br>
<br>¶49. (SBU) Domestic CTAD comment: On June 22, Websense
<br>Security Labs issued an alert after discovering the official
<br>website of the Embassy of Ethiopia in Washington, DC, had
<br>been subverted with obfuscated JavaScript code hidden in an
<br>inline frame (IFrame) with the goal of infecting visitors to
<br>the site with malicious software (malware). The code
<br>redirected users to sites where malware, including Trojan
<br>downloaders, were installed without explicit user action.
<br>According to the alert, the site that hosted the malicious
<br>JavaScript is currently down. On March 20, security company
<br>Sophos discovered a similar IFrame infection on the same
<br>website. At the time, researchers at Sophos noted it
<br>resembled the attack on the Washington, DC, Embassy of
<br>Azerbaijan website that occurred in early March. The
<br>researchers also indicated the redirected sites had been used
<br>by Russian cyber criminals in previous malware infections.

<br>investment:
<br>
<br>¶51. (S//NF) Key highlights:
<br>o Founder of TOPSEC and iTrusChina notes PRC funding and
<br>directive in media interview.
<br>o TOPSEC is China's largest provider of information security
<br>products and services.
<br>o TOPSEC provides services and training for the PLA and has
<br>recruited hackers in the past.
<br>o Potential linkages of China's top companies with the PRC
<br>illustrate the government's use of its "private sector" in
<br>support of information warfare objectives.
<br>
<br>¶52. (SBU) Source paragraph: "During an interview with
<br>journalists from China News Network, chairman of both Beijing
<br>TOPSEC and iTrusChina, He Weidong, spoke about the two
<br>companies, to include investment and contract from the
<br>Chinese Government (People's Republic of China (PRC)) ....
<br>Tianrongxin's capital came from two parts. The Chinese
<br>Government share one part of the investment, and the
<br>management department (of Tianrongxin) share the other part.
<br>He further stated that Tianrongxin was not really a company
<br>but a research institute; in 1995, the company took contracts
<br>from the government's research and development tasks."
<br>
<br>¶53. (S//NF) CTAD comment: In November 1995, He Weidong
<br>founded the security company Tianrongxin, a.k.a. Beijing
<br>TOPSEC Network Security Technology Company, Ltd. TOPSEC is a
<br>China Information Technology Security Center (CNITSEC)
<br>enterprise and has grown to become China's largest provider
<br>of information security products and services. TOPSEC is
<br>credited with launching China's first indigenous firewall in
<br>1996, as well as other information technology (IT) security
<br>products to China's market, to include virtual private
<br>networks, intrusion detection systems, filtering gateways,
<br>and security auditing and management systems. Additionally,
<br>in September 2000, Weidong founded the company
<br>Tianweichengxin, a.k.a. iTrusChina, which became the first
<br>experimental enterprise to develop business Public Key
<br>Infrastructure/Certification Authority services approved by
<br>China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.
<br>
<br>¶54. (SBU) CTAD comment: During an interview with China News
<br>Network, Weidong stated that half of TOPSEC's start-up
<br>capital came from the PRC, with the other half coming from
<br>the company's management department. Additionally, he pointed
<br>out that TOPSEC began not as a company, but as a small
<br>research institute that took contracts from the government's
<br>research and development tasks (NFI). The turning point for
<br>TOPSEC came in 1996 when the company won a significant
<br>contract bid from the Chinese State Statistics Bureau. Since
<br>winning the bid, TOPSEC maintained a 100-percent sales growth
<br>in the following years. Weidong noted the company started out
<br>with 30,000 RMB (approximately $4,400) in 1995, and by 2002,
<br>had earnings of 3 billion RMB (approximately $440,000,000).
<br>Interestingly, shareholders did not receive bonuses, as all
<br>earnings went for future investment. Weidong also stated a
<br>bank loan was never used.
<br>
<br>¶55. (S//NF) CTAD comment: Of note, the CNITSEC is responsible
<br>for overseeing the PRC's Information Technology (IT) security
<br>certification program. It operates and maintains the National
<br>Evaluation and Certification Scheme for IT security and
<br>performs tests for information security products. In 2003,
<br>the CNITSEC signed a Government Security Program (GSP)
<br>international agreement with Microsoft that allowed select
<br>companies such as TOPSEC access to Microsoft source code in
<br>order to secure the Windows platform. XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>
<br>¶56. (S//NF) CTAD comment: Additionally, CNITSEC enterprises
<br>has recruited Chinese hackers in support of nationally-funded
<br>"network attack scientific research projects." From June 2002
<br>to March 2003, TOPSEC employed a known Chinese hacker, Lin
<br>Yong (a.k.a. Lion and owner of the Honker Union of China), as
<br>senior security service engineer to manage security service
<br>and training. Venus Tech, another CNITSEC enterprise privy to
<br>the GSP, is also known to affiliate with XFocus, one of the
<br>few Chinese hacker groups known to develop exploits to new
<br>vulnerabilities in a short period of time, as evidenced in
<br>the 2003 release of Blaster Worm (See CTAD Daily Read File
<br>(DRF) April 4, 2008).
<br>¶57. (S//NF) CTAD comment: While links between top Chinese
<br>companies and the PRC are not uncommon, it illustrates the
<br>PRC's use of its "private sector" in support of governmental
<br>information warfare objectives, especially in its ability to
<br>gather, process, and exploit information. As evidenced with
<br>TOPSEC, there is a strong possibility the PRC is harvesting
<br>the talents of its private sector in order to bolster
<br>offensive and defensive computer network operations
<br>capabilities. (Appendix sources 51-52)

<br>
<br>¶59. (SBU) EUR Iceland - A man and a woman photographed in the
<br>area north of U.S. Embassy Reykjavik June 25. They then
<br>walked toward the backside of the Post, where they took
<br>additional photographs before departing on foot. The man was
<br>seen photographing in the neighborhood for an additional 3
<br>hours. The Surveillance Detection Team found it unusual the
<br>subjects photographed sites other than tourist attractions.
<br>(SIMAS Event: Reykjavik-00257-2009)
<br>
<br>¶60. (SBU) AF Guinea - Two young men were photographed U.S.
<br>Embassy Conakry June 25. A gendarme stopped the pair and took
<br>them to a nearby security booth where they were interviewed
<br>by Post's foreign security national investigator. Their
<br>photos of the Embassy were deleted, and the subjects were
<br>released with a warning.
