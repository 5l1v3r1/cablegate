<br>SUBJECT: GENERAL ABIZAID TALKS IRAN, IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN WITH 
<br>ABU DHABI CROWN PRINCE 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Michele Sison, reasons 1.4 (B) and (D). 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (S) Summary.  On the evening of January 21, Abu Dhabi 
<br>Crown Prince and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed 
<br>Forces Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed (MbZ) Al Nahyan hosted 
<br>CENTCOM Commander General John Abizaid for dinner.  They 
<br>discussed regional security issues, but Iraq was clearly the 
<br>focus of MbZ's interest.  MbZ expressed lack of confidence in 
<br>being able to work with the Maliki government.  MbZ believes 
<br>that the Saudis will not support any Sunni group in Iraq with 
<br>Al-Qaeda ties, but that the Saudis are firm in their resolve 
<br>to counter Iran.  MbZ reiterated UAE interest in acquiring 
<br>Predator B.  Referring to the recent events in Somalia, MbZ 
<br>commented: "The Somalia job was fantastic."  Also present 
<br>were UAE Chief of Staff, Lt. General Hamad Mohammed Thani 
<br>Al-Rumaithy; Director of Intelligence, Staff Brigadier 
<br>General Engineer Essa Saif Mohammed Al-Mazrouei; Commander of 
<br>the Special Operations, Major General Juma Ahmed Al-Bawardi 
<br>Al-Falasi; and Commander of the UAE Air Forces and Air 
<br>Defense, Staff Air Vice-Marshal (Major General) Mohammed 
<br>Sowaidan Al-Gimzy.  End Summary. 
<br> 
<br>Iraq 
<br>---- 
<br>¶2. (C) Clearly the focus for MbZ, discussion began with his 
<br>pronouncement: "Let's talk about Iraq."  Gen. Abizaid noted 
<br>that extremists on both ends of the Sunni/Shia spectrum are 
<br>largely irretrievable, but we still have an opportunity to 
<br>stabilize Iraq by reinforcing the moderate middle ground. 
<br>MbZ said that he had little confidence in being able to work 
<br>with this (Maliki's) government, saying of Maliki: "I think 
<br>we are operating on different frequencies -- no, different 
<br>radio systems altogether." 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S) MbZ asked General Abizaid what the U.S. hoped to 
<br>achieve with the extra troops set to deploy to Iraq in 2007, 
<br>and reiterated his concern about the level of ongoing 
<br>violence against the Sunni.  Abizaid responded that the 
<br>violence in Iraq is highly localized, principally in the 
<br>Baghdad area, and that most of the rest of Iraq is quiet. The 
<br>extra troops are intended to bring calm to Baghdad and give 
<br>the government sufficient space and time to contain violence 
<br>even further.  It will also send a message that the U.S. is 
<br>not abandoning Iraq.  MbZ stated that Ahmad Chalabi and 
<br>others had made a "big deal" out of the Baathist threat, but 
<br>said that the Baathists were not and are not the problem -- 
<br>even though specific individuals linked to the Ba,ath Party 
<br>were/are the problem.  MbZ offered that de-Baathification was 
<br>and is "an unnecessary distraction," stating that "pursuing a 
<br>problem that doesn't really exist only leads to more 
<br>problems."  He said he had seen Iyad Allawi a month ago -- 
<br>noting that Allawi was looking to the UAE for support and 
<br>assurances.  MbZ said that there is no assurance that the UAE 
<br>can give him, adding: "It's not his time."  MbZ added that he 
<br>believes that the Saudis will not assist Sunni groups in Iraq 
<br>that are aligned with Al-Qaeda. 
<br> 
<br>Iran 
<br>---- 
<br>¶4. (S) MbZ acknowledged that Tehran knows that the U.S. is 
<br>serious in its stance against Iranian proliferation.  This 
<br>can be clearly seen in "how Iran is changing its tactics." 
<br>Abizaid pressed that countries in the region should make 
<br>stronger statements.  Weak statements only encourage the 
<br>Iranians: "We need our friends to say that they stand with 
<br>the Americans."  MbZ avoided committing the UAE to anything 
<br>like a public statement and shifted the discussion to other 
<br>countries in the region saying: "The Saudis need no 
<br>encouragement -- they are Wahhabis after all -- and will 
<br>resolutely stand up to any Shi'a anywhere and counter them 
<br>strongly."  Agreeing that it is only a matter of time before 
<br>the Iranians develop or acquire advanced weapons 
<br>technologies, including MTCR-controlled UAV technology, MbZ 
<br>asserted:  "That's why we need it first . . . give me 
<br>Predator B."  MbZ added: "Iran has to know that there is a 
<br>price to pay for every decision they make.  They are 
<br>expanding day by day -- they have to be dealt with before 
<br>they do something tragic."  But that said, he continued: "We 
<br>(UAE) are not ready yet" to confront Iran. 
<br> 
<br>Afghanistan/Pakistan 
<br>-------------------- 
<br>¶5. (S) Abizaid thanked MbZ for the actions of the UAE forces 
<br>currently deployed in Afghanistan.  MbZ reciprocated: "No -- 
<br> 
<br>ABU DHABI 00000145  002 OF 002 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>thank you.  This has been a good chance for us, and we 
<br>appreciate the opportunity."  MbZ questioned the role the 
<br>Iranians were playing in Afghanistan.  He further observed 
<br>that Musharraf is not doing enough to engage the tribes in 
<br>the south, and needs to expand its efforts there. 
<br> 
<br>Lebanon/Hizballah/Somalia 
<br>-------------------------- 
<br>¶6. (S) Noting Lebanese PM Siniora's January 16 visit to the 
<br>UAE, MbZ characterized Siniora as &a good man.  We are 
<br>supporting him."  MbZ said that Hizballah has made a "big 
<br>mistake" in estimating its support in Lebanon, and has 
<br>"played it wrong -- they do not have the support of the 
<br>majority of the Lebanese people."  MbZ discussed with Abizaid 
<br>the military technology that Hizballah used in 2006, 
<br>specifically noting the amount of anti-tank weapons that 
<br>Hizballah possessed.  Abizaid acknowledged that Hizballah has 
<br>access to weapons technology that most Arab states don't 
<br>have.  MbZ interrupted the conversation to state explicitly 
<br>that he wants the U.S. to understand that the UAE was not 
<br>involved in the transfer of those weapons or technologies in 
<br>any way.  Referring to the recent events in Somalia, MbZ 
<br>commented: "The Somalia job was fantastic." 
<br>

<br>message.
