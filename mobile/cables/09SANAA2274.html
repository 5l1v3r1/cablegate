<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: Deputy Prime Minister for Defense and
<br>Security Affairs Rashad al-Alimi for the first time publicly
<br>acknowledged U.S. intelligence assistance in the December 17
<br>strikes during a presentation to Parliament on December 23.
<br>Preliminary reports from Post contacts indicate that Alimi's
<br>presentation, which included both a description of al-Qaeda's
<br>growing threat to Yemen going back to 1992 and an explanation
<br>that the civilian casulaties were in fact AQAP family members
<br>living in terrorist training camps, was well received by the
<br>pro-government MPs in attendance. Opposition MPs largely
<br>stayed away from the session because they have been
<br>boycotting Parliament since early December due to an
<br>unrelated dispute with the ROYG over parliamentary elections.
<br>End summary.

<br>Royg makes the case for aqap strikes before parliament
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---------
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) After repeated calls in Parliament for the ROYG to
<br>explain the December 17 AQAP strikes, Deputy Prime Minister
<br>for Defense and Security Affairs Rashad al-Alimi described to
<br>MPs the al-Qaeda threat in Yemen during a December 23
<br>presentation. Alimi said that the strikes were carried out
<br>"using intelligence aid from Saudi Arabia and the United
<br>States of America in our fight against terrorism." He pinned
<br>the occurrence of civilian casualties squarely on AQAP's
<br>leadership, saying that "militants" had brought their own
<br>family members to the training camps. Alimi's presentation
<br>before Parliament, which included a history of al-Qaeda's
<br>attacks on Yemeni targets since 1992 and a list of AQAP
<br>operatives killed in the December 17 strikes, was open to the
<br>press and received prominent coverage the following day in
<br>official and independent media outlets. Most of the strikes'
<br>harshest critics -- members of the minority Joint Meeting
<br>Parties (JMP) -- did not attend the presentation due to an
<br>ongoing boycott of Parliament since early December resulting
<br>from a dispute with the ROYG over the last round of
<br>parliamentary elections, according to opposition leader MP
<br>Hamid al-Ahmar. The JMP did send one opposition member,
<br>Islah Party MP Ali Ashal, from Abyan, to press Alimi on the
<br>issue of civilian casualties.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) For days following the December 17 strikes, Post
<br>contacts who supported the strikes lamented the ROYG's
<br>silence on the issue of civilian casualties. Alimi's
<br>presentation, which included satellite images and photographs
<br>of the training camps, was generally well received by MPs
<br>from the ruling General People's Congress (GPC) party, many
<br>of whom had previously expressed frustration with the
<br>government's tight hold on details of the strike. MP Nabil
<br>Basha told Pol FSN that Alimi's presentation was the subject
<br>of a heated debate over the issue of civilian casulaties,
<br>despite the majority GPC's overall support for aggressive
<br>action against al-Qaeda. On December 26, Parliament anounced
<br>the formation of a 10-member fact-finding commission, chaired
<br>by Deputy Speaker of Parliament Himyar al-Ahmar, to
<br>investigate reports of civilian deaths, according to
<br>government media.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) MPs pressed Alimi to answer why the strikes had not
<br>been carried out earlier, what measures were in place to
<br>limit collateral damage, and how best to compensate the
<br>civilian victims in Abyan, according to a Finance Ministry
<br>official who witnessed the session. "At long last, the ROYG
<br>addressed the issue of so-called innocent civilians being
<br>killed. Once it understood that these were training camps
<br>and that civilians were relatives of al-Qaeda people,
<br>Parliament respected the government's actions," xxxxx,
<br>told EconOff.xxxxx, told EconOff that the
<br>presentation impressed MPs and would go a long way in helping
<br>future CT operations. "Why did the government wait so long
<br>after the strikes to explain everything?" is a common refrain
<br>heard among Post political contacts, referring to Alimi's
<br>
<br>Sanaa 00002274 002 of 002
<br>
<br>
<br>presentation to Parliament.

<br>Foreign minister asks u.s. To stay quiet on support role
<br>--------------------------------------------- -----------
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Foreign Minister Abu Bakr al-Qirbi told the Charge on
<br>December 23 that the U.S. should continue to refer inquiries
<br>to the Yemeni Government, highlight the ROYG's indigenous CT
<br>capabilities, and stress that al-Qaeda represents a threat
<br>not only to the West, but also to Yemen's security. Qirbi
<br>also attacked the opposition Islah party and the Southern
<br>Movement for "speaking in defense of al-Qaeda" by
<br>characterizing the strikes as targeting innocent civilians.
