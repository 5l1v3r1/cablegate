<br>-------
<br>SUMMARY
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) During a November 28 meeting with the U.S.
<br>Congressional Delegation led by Senate Majority Leader Harry
<br>Reid, President Alvaro Uribe outlined Plan Colombia's
<br>accomplishments and stressed the importance of continued U.S.
<br>support. Uribe said passage of the U.S.- Colombia Trade
<br>Promotion Agreement (TPA) would attract vital investment to
<br>Colombia and show U.S. political support for its best ally in
<br>the region. Uribe said his recent dispute with Venezuelan
<br>President Hugo Chavez occurred because Chavez violated
<br>Colombia's institutional hierarchy by directly contacting
<br>Colombian Army Commander Mario Montoya. Uribe claimed that
<br>Chavez had expansionist plans for his model of "new
<br>socialism," and likened the threat Chavez poses to Latin
<br>America to that posed by Hitler in Europe. END SUMMARY.

<br>-------------------------------------
<br>CONTINUED PLAN COLOMBIA SUPPORT VITAL
<br>-------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) Asked by Senator Menendez if the time had arrived to
<br>shift U.S. assistance from traditional Plan Colombia programs
<br>towards alternative development and justice-sector projects,
<br>Uribe said that Colombia had done much under Plan Colombia,
<br>but more remains to accomplish. The GOC controlled only fifty
<br>percent of its territory in 2000, but now maintains a
<br>presence in every municipality. Spraying and manual
<br>eradication programs supported by the U.S. would destroy over
<br>200,000 hectares of coca in 2007. Uribe said to maintain
<br>security and continue the fight against narco-trafficking,
<br>the U.S. must continue its vital support.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------
<br>GOC INVESTING IN JUSTICE AND ALTERNATIVE DEVELOPMENT
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------
<br>
<br>¶4. (U) Uribe said his government had committed to justice
<br>programs and alternative development. He explained how the
<br>GOC had passed important judicial reforms and almost doubled
<br>
<br>the budget for the justice system over the past four years.
<br>He noted that Colombia began producing biofuel, and expanded
<br>coffee production by over one million bags over the last five
<br>years. Uribe reminded the Senators of the difficulty of
<br>alternative development in a country with over 50 percent
<br>jungle terrain (578,000 square kilometers). He explained that
<br>the GOC's Forest Families program works to secure the jungle
<br>by employing rural families to patrol and report illicit
<br>activity.
<br>
<br>-------------------------------
<br>EXTRADITIONS ARE NON-NEGOTIABLE
<br>-------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) Uribe explained that after he met with families of
<br>hostages held by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
<br>(FARC) and spoke with French officials about the release of
<br>French-Colombian hostage Ingrid Betancourt, he dropped his
<br>original position that he would not discuss a humanitarian
<br>exchange with the FARC unless it coincided with a broader
<br>peace process. Despite pressure from Chavez and others, he
<br>had insisted that any humanitarian exchange include the three
<br>American hostages. In contrast, the GOC would not support the
<br>inclusion of extradited FARC members in the U.S. He
<br>explained that Colombia had extradited over 650 criminals to
<br>the U.S. to date, a level of cooperation with U.S. justice
<br>unprecedented anywhere else in the world. "For us,
<br>extradition is a policy that is non-negotiable," he stated.
<br>
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>TPA WILL BRING INVESTMENT, SHOW SUPPORT
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) Senator Crapo asked for Uribe's views on the TPA and
<br>labor unionists' concerns. The President said the TPA was
<br>economically important for his country, because it would help
<br>Colombia attract foreign investment. He said the TPA would
<br>probably not have a large immediate impact in increasing
<br>Colombian exports to the U.S., but with increased foreign
<br>investment, their export sectors could develop to be more
<br>competitive in U.S. markets. Uribe said the TPA was also
<br>important for political reasons, since it would show U.S.
<br>support for its best ally in the region. "I don't know how I
<br>could explain to my nation and the international community
<br>why the best friend of the U.S. was not granted a TPA," he
<br>said.
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) Uribe said his government had made great efforts at
<br>improving the situation of labor unionists. In the past, 256
<br>unionists were killed in a single year. In 2007, 30
<br>unionists had been killed to date, and investigations and
<br>prosecutions were underway. Since 2002, the Prosecutor
<br>General's Office has prosecuted 56 cases of labor violence,
<br>sending 118 people to prison. In the majority of cases,
<br>Uribe said, the killer was not linked to the unionists'
<br>employers, but rather to terrorist groups that suspected the
<br>union members were helping rival gangs. The GOC has
<br>protected over 6,000 people in 2007, at a cost of nearly USD
<br>40 million, including over 1200 unionists. Uribe said there
<br>
<br>were many private sector unions that disagreed with the large
<br>labor confederations' criticism of the TPA. He held regular
<br>lunches with the large labor confederations to discuss labor
<br>issues, but noted that they would never accept the TPA due to
<br>their ideological opposition to free trade and the United
<br>States.
<br>
<br>------------------------------------
<br>URIBE: CHAVEZ POSES THREAT TO REGION
<br>------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU) Asked by Senator Conrad to comment on President
<br>Chavez, Uribe said he prefers to be prudent in statements
<br>about the leader of this significant trading partner. He had
<br>authorized opposition Senator Piedad Cordoba and Chavez to
<br>facilitate talks with the FARC on a humanitarian accord after
<br>the families of the hostages implored him to do so. He
<br>recognized this was taking a great political risk, but saw
<br>Chavez as perhaps the only person respected enough by the
<br>FARC's leaders to reach an agreement to release the hostages.
<br>
<br>
<br>¶9. (SBU) Uribe then reviewed the events that led him to
<br>suspend Cordoba's and Chavez' roles as facilitators. He said
<br>that in an October 12 meeting, Chavez told him that he wanted
<br>to meet with FARC leader Marulanda in Colombia. Uribe told
<br>him this could only be done if the FARC released an initial
<br>group of hostages, with a commitment to release the rest
<br>later. The meeting would also have to be conducted at a
<br>specific demilitarized point, not a general zone as proposed
<br>by Chavez. To Uribe's surprise, Chavez publicly announced
<br>in Paris that Uribe had given him approval to meet with
<br>Marulanda in Colombia without mentioning any of the
<br>conditions set in their prior meeting. Uribe saw this as a
<br>violation of trust which put in question Chavez' reliability
<br>as a facilitator.
<br>
<br>¶10. (SBU) Uribe said the final factor that caused him to
<br>terminate Chavez' mandate as a negotiator was Chavez' call to
<br>Colombian Army Commander Montoya, despite Uribe's earlier
<br>specific instructions not to contact his military officials.
<br>Uribe stressed several times that this was "a violation of
<br>our institutional hierarchy," explaining he had a duty to
<br>defend democratic values. Uribe said Chavez was trying to
<br>create a "personal empire," and had expansionist plans in the
<br>region for his model of "new socialism." Chavez' model
<br>violated democratic values such as freedom of the press,
<br>local elections, and independence of the Central Bank. He
<br>likened the threat Chavez poses to Latin America to that
<br>posed by Hitler in Europe.
<br>
<br>-----------------------------------------
<br>URIBE SEEKS SUPPORT FROM OTHER PRESIDENTS
<br>-----------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶11. (SBU) Uribe mentioned he would see Chavez in Ecuador on
<br>November 29 at President Rafael Correa's inauguration
<br>ceremony of the new constitutional assembly. He said it
<br>would be a difficult trip, but a necessary one and he would
<br>not leave the stage exclusively to Chavez. In recent weeks,
<br>Uribe saw positive movements by Correa away from Chavez-type
<br>radicalism, and he was not sure which way the Ecuadorian
<br>leader would lean. Uribe said he also called several other
<br>Latin American presidents to seek their support. Uribe said:
<br>"I do not want to leave political space for Chavez alone."
<br>
<br>¶12. (U) This cable has been cleared by Senator Reid.
