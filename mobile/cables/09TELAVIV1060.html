<br>SUBJECT: REP. WEXLER DISCUSSES IRAN WITH IDF INTELLIGENCE 
<br>CHIEF YADLIN 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: DCM Luis G, Moreno, Reason 1.4 (b) (d) 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (S)  Representative Robert Wexler (D, Florida), 
<br>accompanied by Deputy Chief of Staff Joshua Rogin and DCM 
<br>Moreno, met with Israel Defense Forces Intelligence Chief, MG 
<br>Amos Yadlin, on Sunday 10 May 2009.  MG Yadlin focused his 
<br>discussion on the preparations for the upcoming visit of 
<br>Prime Minister Netanyahu to the United States and the Iranian 
<br>nuclear program.  MG Yadlin informed Rep. Wexler that the PM 
<br>was preparing intensely for his upcoming visit to Washington. 
<br> In addition to hours of policy review, the PM had been 
<br>provided significant amounts of intelligence from the IDI and 
<br>Mossad on Iran's nuclear program.  The intelligence presented 
<br>included assessments of the current status of the Iranian 
<br>program; timelines, effects of sanctions; views of the 
<br>international community; and outcomes of engagement.  The 
<br>differences that exist between the intelligence community in 
<br>interpretations of the Iranian nuclear program as well as the 
<br>relationship between Iran and the Palestinians were also 
<br>presented.  MG Yadlin indicated that the IDF had presented 
<br>its information last week, leaving the cabinet on Friday 08 
<br>May 2009 to consider policy options and how information will 
<br>be presented during the upcoming visit to Washington. 
<br>Although no direct feedback was provided, MG Yadlin opined 
<br>that the PM appears determined on Iran. 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (S)  Rep. Wexler asked MG Yadlin to expand on the 
<br>differences in the interpretations of the intelligence.  MG 
<br>Yadlin explained that until 2003, Iran had violated the 
<br>Nuclear Proliferation Treaty by having a weaponization group 
<br>and although Iran could show civilian uses for a missile 
<br>program and a fissile program, there was no justification for 
<br>a weaponization group.  He went on to say that Iran halted 
<br>its program in 2003 after the invasion of Iraq, but 
<br>reinvigorated the program in 2005.  He expressed that some in 
<br>the US agree with this and others do not.  He went on to 
<br>explain that Israel is not in a position to underestimate 
<br>Iran and be surprised like the US was on 11 September 2001. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (S)  MG Yadlin explained that Israel tries to be more 
<br>precise than the US in estimating Iran's intentions and 
<br>timeline for obtaining a nuclear bomb.  Iran is in the 
<br>position of wanting to pay only a minimum cost for its 
<br>current program. It does not want to be North Korea or what 
<br>Iraq was before 2003.  Iran intends to keep resolutions and 
<br>sanctions at a certain manageable level and continue to 
<br>produce low enriched uranium until there is enough for 
<br>several bombs.  MG Yadlin stated that Iran could decide to 
<br>produce a bomb by 2010, but Iran is waiting for the right 
<br>time in the future and that there are some who will always 
<br>doubt it despite the evidence. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (S)  Rep. Wexler then asked about the prospect of 
<br>engagement.  MG Yadlin said he does not oppose engagement, 
<br>and in fact gave a speech approximately six months ago 
<br>expressing that Israel needed to find a way to find positives 
<br>in engagement.   He feels there needs to be an agreed upon 
<br>deadline; a measure for success or failure; and a plan B if 
<br>engagement does not work in order for engagement to have any 
<br>chance.  He also expressed strongly that engagement should 
<br>have already started.  MG Yadlin outlined four possible 
<br>outcomes of engagement.  Two good outcomes would be the 
<br>Iranian nuclear program stopped or a failure of engagement 
<br>that allows Russia and China to see the US made all efforts 
<br>to prevent the program diplomatically and allows for greater 
<br>cooperation in the future.  Two bad outcomes would be Iran 
<br>playing for time with no claim of failure on the part of 
<br>engagement or a bad bargain that still allows Iran to obtain 
<br>a nuclear bomb even if in a longer timeline.  Rep. Wexler 
<br>went on to discuss that there is a third good option in that 
<br>the President may have better leverage with the American 
<br>public to support action if engagement efforts are attempted 
<br>and failed.  Rep Wexler recommended that the Israeli people 
<br>need to consider the US perspective and public opinion.  MG 
<br>Yadlin responded that he is not recommending the US enter a 
<br>third front, but it has to be understood that Israel sees 
<br>things differently and that Israel has to be ready and can 
<br>not remove the military option from the table.  Rep Wexler 
<br>stated that he expected Israel would be pleasantly surprised 
<br>by the President's acceptance of all possible options in 
<br>regards to Iran.
