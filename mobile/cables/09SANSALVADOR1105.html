<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: At its 25th annual convention December 13, the
<br>FMLN, without President Funes present, voiced solidarity with Cuba
<br>and Venezuela, repeated opposition to "the Empire," and voted to
<br>join the Fifth Socialist International. It decided to devolve
<br>authority to select candidates for local office to local party
<br>organizations. Senior FMLN leadership told us December 14 there
<br>had been no change in the FMLN's stated desire for good relations
<br>with the U.S. and attributed some of the anti-U.S. rhetoric by FMLN
<br>members (including VP Sanchez Ceren) to events outside of El
<br>Salvador, and an inability to adapt to new circumstances. End
<br>Summary.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) In an atmosphere closer to a rock concert than a political
<br>convention, the FMLN held its 25th annual national convention
<br>December 13 in San Salvador where it affirmed solidarity with Cuba
<br>and Venezuela, opposition to "the Empire," and adopted changes to
<br>the party statutes with virtually no opposition. The FMLN voted to
<br>join -- as party, not as government -- the Fifth Socialist
<br>International proposed by Venezuela's Chavez and other left-leaning
<br>leaders and declared its alliance with Chavez' "21st Century
<br>Socialism." In what could prove to be a significant change in
<br>future elections, delegates voted to modify party bylaws to allow
<br>local party organizations, rather than national FMLN leadership, to
<br>choose candidates for local office. In his keynote speech, VP
<br>Salvador Sanchez Ceren compared leaves blowing through the meeting
<br>area with the "dead leaves of ARENA," noting the disarray and
<br>internecine conflict that has divided the Salvadoran Right. He
<br>declared that the FMLN's socialism would be distinctly Salvadoran
<br>and called on the GOES to choose between socialism or
<br>neoliberalism. Salvadoran President Mauricio Funes did not attend
<br>the FMLN convention.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Charge, Acting DCM and PolCouns met December 14 with Medardo
<br>Gonzalez, FMLN General Coordinator and head of legislative bloc,
<br>Sigfrido Reyes, FMLN Spokesman and Assembly Deputy, and Oscar
<br>Ortiz, Santa Tecla Mayor. Gonzalez stated categorically there had
<br>been no change in the FMLN's stance of seeking a constructive
<br>relationship with the U.S. Noting recent statements by VP Sanchez
<br>Ceren criticizing the U.S., the three were quick to say there was
<br>no anti-U.S. policy in the FMLN and, on the contrary, the FMLN and
<br>the Funes Government saw strengthening U.S.-Salvadoran relations as
<br>a priority. Reyes, agreeing with the Charge that the U.S. and FMLN
<br>could disagree civilly, emphasized Honduras as the FMLN's and Latin
<br>America's biggest disappointment with the USG, arguing that ousted
<br>Honduran President Zelaya had received political assurances of his
<br>reinstatement that had later been withdrawn, effectively
<br>strengthening the hand of coup leaders. Reyes said he believes
<br>this has badly damaged U.S. credibility in the region. Charge
<br>noted that the commitment to seek Zelaya's reinstatement depended
<br>on action by the Honduran Congress, that the USG supported Zelaya's
<br>reinstatement, but did not want to impose a solution. Gonzalez
<br>said he recognized it was much easier for the FMLN to take a
<br>position on Honduras than it was for the Funes government. Ortiz
<br>suggested much of the anti-Imperialist commentary still emanating
<br>from the FMLN was, in part, a function of the party's slow
<br>adaptation to a new world of governing and the difficulty of
<br>setting aside long-held political rhetoric.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Comment: The FMLN's historic, guerrilla roots run deep, and
<br>the rhetoric of years on the battlefield and two decades in
<br>opposition will not disappear quickly, or maybe ever. While our
<br>outreach to the FMLN during the 2008-2009 campaign and since Funes'
<br>inauguration has paid off in open channels of communications, we
<br>continue to combat old suspicions of U.S. motives in El Salvador
<br>and the region. On the other hand, good relations with the U.S.
<br>enjoys a 90 percent approval rating. If the FMLN overdoes its
<br>radicalism, it will have a hard time sustaining its current
<br>electoral advantages.
