<br>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR US-SPAIN HIGH LEVEL DEFENSE TALKS 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre for reasons 1.4 b & d. 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C/NF) Dan, welcome back to Spain. I appreciate your 
<br>patience and efforts to finally resolve the NCIS/OSI issue 
<br>and I'm glad that you've made this High-Level Defense 
<br>Committee (HLDC) meeting a priority. Now that the Permanent 
<br>Committee is back on track, handling routine issues at the 
<br>staff level, we can use the HLDC forum to share views and set 
<br>strategic direction on key international policy issues like 
<br>Afghanistan, Kosovo, the Couso case, missile defense, the 
<br>NATO Summit in 2008, and future US use of Moron and Rota 
<br>military bases. As we've discussed before, Spain can at 
<br>times be a difficult partner, but never more so than when it 
<br>feels ignored. This meeting, along with Secretary Rice's 
<br>visit in a few weeks, should reassure the GOS that we take it 
<br>seriously, but while reminding MOD that we have high 
<br>expectations of such important partners. 
<br>
<br>-- US USE OF SPANISH BASES -- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C/NF) The DCM, the Embassy's political-military team, and 
<br>I travel regularly to Rota and Moron, the Spanish bases where 
<br>nearly 3000 US troops and dependents live and work. With 
<br>each successive visit, I am more impressed by the important 
<br>activities and outstanding working-level cooperation at the 
<br>bases. The Czech Deputy Prime Minister, planning for the 
<br>possibility of US missile defense installations in his 
<br>country, recently visited Rota in order to understand how the 
<br>US military behaves as a tenant. Perhaps on your next trip 
<br>you'll be able to travel to southern Spain to get a better 
<br>idea of the key role that the bases play in US efforts in 
<br>Iraq, Afghanistan, and other operations. As you know, it is 
<br>taking MOD longer than we expected to implement its new 
<br>interagency process for reviewing proposed Naval Criminal 
<br>Investigative Service and USAF Office of Special 
<br>Investigations activities. We continue to press them to 
<br>speed the process so that we can begin to implement the 
<br>agreement and our investigators can get back to work. 
<br>
<br>-- AFGHANISTAN -- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C/NF) Despite the limitations imposed by Spanish domestic 
<br>politics, which are foremost in every minister's mind, due to 
<br>nationwide local/regional elections in two weeks and national 
<br>elections within the year, Spain remains a stalwart ally in 
<br>Afghanistan. Though not currently in a position to increase 
<br>the 690-soldier troop ceiling that Parliament set, the GOS 
<br>insists that it is committed to maintain current levels for 
<br>the long haul. Your primary interlocutor, MOD Secretary 
<br>General for Policy Luis Cuesta, recently spent a week in 
<br>Kabul and Herat with his counterpart from MFA. They both 
<br>returned relatively optimistic that NATO-ISAF is making 
<br>progress but understanding more clearly than ever that NATO 
<br>won't be able to leave anytime soon. Top MOD leaders have 
<br>also told us privately that CHOD General Sanz has initiated 
<br>discussions in Brussels regarding the possibility that Spain 
<br>would staff the core of the ISAF HQ in summer 2008, after 
<br>Spanish elections. We continue to press the GOS to increase 
<br>its public diplomacy efforts, and to consider doing more when 
<br>it is able. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C/NF) While the GOS has lately complained about the lack 
<br>of coordination between ISAF and Operation Enduring Freedom 
<br>-- specifically the airstrikes in Herat province that killed 
<br>civilians as well as Taliban -- Spain remains active on the 
<br>security and reconstruction fronts. The Spanish Provincial 
<br>Reconstruction Team (PRT) is well regarded for involving 
<br>local Afghanis in its efforts to provide basic services and 
<br>critical infrastructure to the people of Badghis province, 
<br>but MFA officials note that there is no sign of the central 
<br>government or national security forces in the province. While 
<br>carefully complying with its caveat, Spanish troops supported 
<br>NATO-ISAF's Operation Achilles earlier this spring by sealing 
<br>the southern border of their zone. Regarding its Sevilla 
<br>Ministerial commitments, MOD sources say that two Spanish 
<br>military training teams (OMLTs) will arrive in Afghanistan in 
<br>early June to begin training Afghan National Army troops. 
<br>They have told us that that these 30-50 soldiers will be in 
<br>addition to the 690 troops that are already deployed. The 
<br>Spanish Army is also proceeding with its purchase of tactical 
<br>UAVs, and expects to have them in the field later this year. 
<br>
<br>-- KOSOVO -- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C/NF) In the Balkans, where its troops have served for 
<br>more than 15 years, Spain has shown its ability to maintain 
<br>troops for the long-term. Right now, however, we need keep 
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000911 002 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>making our case to keep troops in Kosovo. For domestic 
<br>political reasons and fear of provoking Russia, Spain is 
<br>ambivalent about the current direction of Kosovo policy. So 
<br>long as there is a UN resolution authorizing the Ahtissari 
<br>plan, Spain will maintain its troops in KFOR. If the UN 
<br>fails to agree on a new resolution, Spain has said that it 
<br>would have to seriously consider pulling its troops out, but 
<br>has emphasized that it would do this only in extremis and 
<br>only in careful consultation with allies. We need to keep the 
<br>pressure on, reminding Spain that NATO has a critical role 
<br>and that we can't let the Russians drive a wedge between the 
<br>US and Europe on issues like this. 
<br>
<br>-- MISSILE DEFENSE -- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C/NF) Though initially tentative about the US missile 
<br>defense (MD) plan, Spain listened carefully to the Missile 
<br>Defense Agency Deputy Director BG O'Reilly's presentation in 
<br>March, asked some tough questions, and has taken the position 
<br>that so long as the US attends to Russian and is willing to 
<br>discuss the issue in NATO, it won't stand in the way. MOD 
<br>said that it will soon announce support for the development 
<br>of a NATO study on the issue. MOD has asked to see a 
<br>simulation of how well the proposed MD system would cover 
<br>Spain, though it says that it doesn't currently see a 
<br>particular threat from Iran and is willing to support the 
<br>US's plan primarily as a show of solidarity among allies. 
<br>While we need to continue to inform and engage MOD on this 
<br>issue, we don't see Spain causing problems on missile defense. 
<br>
<br>-- NATO -- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C/NF) On 2008 NATO Summit issues of enlargement and 
<br>partnership, Spain believes that NATO should keep an open 
<br>door to European applicants who can qualify. MOD says that 
<br>the Balkans should be treated as a single unit, despite their 
<br>different stages of development, because it will be important 
<br>to future Balkans stability to eventually get them all around 
<br>the NATO table. Regarding Ukraine and Georgia, Spain is not 
<br>opposed to the idea that they would eventually join NATO, but 
<br>says that the best thing at the moment is to wait and see 
<br>what direction they choose to go. Spain is a big fan of NATO 
<br>partnerships, especially the Mediterranean Dialogue, which it 
<br>believes should be strengthened for the sake of fighting 
<br>terrorism in North Africa and supporting the current 
<br>governments and militaries against extremists. MOD says that 
<br>the Med Dialogue countries know that they aren't going to 
<br>someday join NATO, but that they should be invited to observe 
<br>exercises, included in training, and given other 
<br>opportunities to deepen ties and cooperate with NATO. 
<br>
<br>-- CRITICAL SIDEBAR ISSUES -- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C/NF) A couple of other key issues will be in the air, if 
<br>not actually on the agenda. For our side, it will be 
<br>important to continue to raise the Couso case, in which three 
<br>US servicemen face charges related to the 2003 death of 
<br>Spanish cameraman Jose Couso during the battle for Baghdad. 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX. I raised this issue with Vice 
<br>President de la Vega on April 30. She was supportive but 
<br>uncertain that direct GOS involvement would be productive. 
<br>DCM spoke late last week with the Deputy Justice Minister, 
<br>and we continue to prod the GOS to appeal. We were informed 
<br>Monday morning that the Chief Prosecutor of Spain's National 
<br>Court has indeed filed an appeal, which will go to the same 
<br>court which originally dismissed the case (in 2006) on 
<br>procedural grounds. The Deputy DIGENPOL in MOD told the 
<br>Embassy last week that MOD completely supports the US 
<br>position, and said that he would raise with his superiors the 
<br>possibility of making a statement to the court or otherwise 
<br>demonstrating support. The Deputy Justice Minister also said 
<br>the GOS strongly opposes a case brought against former 
<br>Secretary Rumsfeld and will work to get it dismissed. The 
<br>
<br>SIPDIS 
<br>judge involved in that case has told us he has already 
<br>started the process of dismissing the case. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C/NF) An issue that MOD may raise with you is their 
<br>perception of "imbalance" in the defense industrial 
<br>relationship. The HLDC is not the most appropriate forum for 
<br>a discussion of this issue, especially since Al Volkman, 
<br>Director of International Cooperation for acquisitions, will 
<br>be in Madrid at the same time as you precisely for the 
<br>long-scheduled 17th US-Spain Defense Industrial Cooperation 
<br>Committee meeting and the 4th US-Spain Declaration of 
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000911 003 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>Principles meeting. Nonetheless, Spanish Defense Ministry 
<br>officials have seen you with Secretary Gates, and may raise 
<br>the issue with you in hopes of getting it top-level 
<br>attention. Defense Minister Alonso has raised the issue in 
<br>public speeches and his people have raised it in meetings. 
<br>They point to Spanish purchases like 24 Tomahawk missiles and 
<br>US AEGIS combat systems for its F-100 frigates and S-80 subs, 
<br>which the GOS made over the protests of European allies like 
<br>France and Germany, and say that while MOD plans to continue 
<br>a strong relationship with the US defense industry and knows 
<br>that it is getting the best when it buys US, it would 
<br>appreciate a "gesture" from the US so that it can show 
<br>domestic audiences that Spain gets something out of the 
<br>relationship. While we continue to push Spain to buy into 
<br>the Joint Strike Fighter program, we know that Spain is very 
<br>anxious to learn whether Spanish company EADS-CASA will get 
<br>the Joint Cargo Aircraft contract. We try to remind MOD that 
<br>while there may be a dollar imbalance in the defense 
<br>relationship, Spain benefits from the relationship in other 
<br>ways, not only getting the best technology for its military, 
<br>but also being able to sell products that include US 
<br>technology to third countries. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C/NF) We want to use the HLDC to further strengthen the 
<br>Permanent Committee and are pleased that EUCOM will propose 
<br>the joint working group as a means to increase EUCOM 
<br>involvement on Spanish military issues. Direct and ongoing 
<br>communication between MOD and EUCOM at the staff level can 
<br>only help us to avoid minor problems that have the potential 
<br>to escalate, like NCIS/OSI.
