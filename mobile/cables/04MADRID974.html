<br>
<br>REF: STATE 2311
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador George Argyros for reasons 1.4 (B) and (D)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: Ambassador Argyros had a cordial discussion
<br>March 22 with Miguel Angel Moratinos, reported to be the
<br>leading candidate to serve as Foreign Minister under the
<br>government of Spanish Socialist Worker's Party (PSOE) leader
<br>Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. Moratinos stressed Zapatero,s
<br>appreciation for the President,s phone call after the March
<br>14 Spanish elections. Moratinos was also grateful for
<br>Secretary Powell,s phone call to him on Friday, March 18.
<br>
<br>SIPDIS
<br>Moratinos said that Zapatero had asked him to convey to the
<br>Ambassador that his government will want to maintain the same
<br>level of excellent bilateral relations that had been
<br>constructed during the Popular Party (PP) government, and
<br>would express its differences constructively, as among
<br>friends. On Iraq, Moratinos reiterated Zapatero,s position
<br>that absent a UN mandate for troops there, Spanish troops
<br>would be withdrawn. However, he underscored that the U.S. and
<br>Spain must remain focused on their shared objective in Iraq:
<br>promoting stability and democracy. He said we should work to
<br>find a way to meet these objectives "with or without" Spanish
<br>troops. He also said that the PSOE government was
<br>considering increasing Spanish presence in Afghanistan, from
<br>where PSOE sees the most direct Al-Qaeda threat,
<br>demonstrating that PSOE would not appease terrorists.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Moratinos said that Zapatero was grateful for the USG
<br>response to the terrorist attacks and the Spanish elections,
<br>but was concerned about criticism in the U.S. press and some
<br>other "sectors" that undermined the legitimacy of the Spanish
<br>elections by saying that Al-Qaeda had put PSOE in power.
<br>"This is a redline for us, which we cannot accept," Moratinos
<br>said, and asked for USG help in dispelling this image.
<br>Ambassador Argyros drew from talking points in reftel to
<br>convey USG,s desire to work constructively with the new
<br>Spanish government on counter-terrorism and a range of other
<br>issues. END SUMMARY
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Moratinos opened the March 22 meeting with Ambassador
<br>Argyros by expressing his and President-elect Zapatero,s
<br>deep appreciation for the spirit and tone of the phone calls
<br>from President Bush to Zapatero and Secretary Powell to
<br>Moratinos. He said Zapatero has specifically asked him to
<br>convey to Ambassador Argyros that the Spanish relationship
<br>with the U.S. would be his government's high priority. PSOE
<br>wanted to build on the close ties that the Popular Party
<br>under President Aznar had built with the U.S. It would be
<br>"stupidity" to end these ties, and PSOE wants to build on
<br>this strong relationship, Moratinos said. Moratinos noted
<br>that Spain will want to strengthen its ties with Europe, "our
<br>family," but that this does not contradict the need for close
<br>ties with the U.S. PSOE wants rich U.S.-EU ties and strong
<br>U.S.-Spanish bilateral relations, he added. "We intend to
<br>work on the basis of no change" in our bilateral relations
<br>from the PP government. He said that the difference between
<br>the PSOE and PP approach would be that while PSOE would try
<br>to be "constructively involved" in Iraq and the Middle East,
<br>the new government would convey its concerns to the U.S., in
<br>the spirit of friendship and the desire to find common
<br>ground.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Moratinos expressed appreciation for his phone call
<br>with Secretary Powell, which he called "excellent."
<br>Moratinos said that he had encountered the Secretary on
<br>various occasions in his capacity as EU envoy, and he would
<br>"never forget" the warmth of the Secretary's contacts with
<br>him. In the phone call, Moratinos said he had expressed his
<br>desire, as soon as he is formally invested as Foreign
<br>Minister, to visit Washington as his first trip. He
<br>reiterated this to the Ambassador. Moratinos said the
<br>objective would be to underscore our strong ties and to have
<br>a serious discussion about what we can and cannot do on
<br>certain issues, and to find common ground. He thought the
<br>government might be formally in place in the third week of
<br>April and would like to visit right after that.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Ambassador Argyros expressed deep condolences for
<br>the March 11 terrorist attacks. Moratinos said that the
<br>President and Secretary Powell had reacted sincerely to the
<br>attacks and appropriately to the results of the Spanish
<br>elections three days later. Moratinos said that Zapatero was
<br>concerned by the reaction by some press and "some sectors" in
<br>the U.S. (but not the USG itself) that Al-Qaeda handed PSOE
<br>their electoral victory. This, Moratinos said, undermined
<br>the legitimacy of the Spanish election results. Spain is a
<br>serious democracy, he said, with a sense of pride and
<br>commitment in defending and supporting what Spain has built
<br>through the years. Moratinos said that PSOE "will not
<br>accept" criticism that Al-Qaeda put Zapatero in power. He
<br>said this would be an insult to Zapatero, to Spanish
<br>democracy and the Spanish people. Moratinos asked for USG
<br>help ) "Whatever you can do" to help dispel this image.
<br>This is a "redline" for PSOE, he stressed. PSOE is not going
<br>to accept the image that the Spanish Republic is a banana
<br>republic. Ambassador Argyros noted USG statements that the
<br>elections 3 days after the horrific terrorist attacks was a
<br>victory for Spanish democracy.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Moratinos and Argyros agreed on the importance of
<br>avoiding setting US-Spanish relations through rhetoric and
<br>the need for private dialogue and meetings. Ambassador
<br>Argyros also suggested the importance of avoiding commentary
<br>or speculation on the US elections by senior PSOE leadership.
<br>Moratinos said that PSOE, including Zapatero, understood
<br>this. He said that there would be no more commentary from
<br>Zapatero or the PSOE on the US elections.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) On Iraq, Moratinos said that "if there is not a
<br>change in the role of the UN" in Iraq, we will pull out our
<br>troops. But, he asked the Ambassador to convey to the
<br>President and the Secretary that Spanish commitment to a
<br>stable, democratic Iraq remained unwavering, and that this
<br>would continue "with or without Spanish troops." Moratinos
<br>said PSOE knows the U.S. would prefer that the troops remain,
<br>but, he added, it is important to underscore that we share
<br>the same objective of a democratic, stable Iraq. "Let's talk
<br>together," he said, about how we can achieve this objective.
<br>The U.S., he said, has a great role to play in this, and
<br>should. "We are not going to put our finger in your eye" on
<br>Iraq, according to Moratinos. Again, he reiterated his
<br>desire to discuss how we can achieve our objectives in Iraq
<br>"with or without" Spanish troops.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Ambassador Argyros underscored our commitment to
<br>maintain strong US-Spanish ties in NATO. Moratinos said that
<br>"nothing will change at all" on NATO issues, noting that the
<br>USG and the previous PSOE government had had excellent
<br>relations. Moratinos said that the new government was
<br>thinking of increasing Spanish involvement in Afghanistan, to
<br>help counter Al-Qaeda there. He said PSOE wanted to make
<br>clear that it would not appease Al-Qaeda, and wanted to
<br>respond in way that Spain could be most effective. He noted
<br>that the new government would have a commitment to the
<br>Spanish people to react to the March 11 attacks. He
<br>indicated that increasing Spain's role in Afghanistan would
<br>also show that the PSOE government was not appeasing
<br>terrorists.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) On counter-terrorism, Moratinos said that Spain,
<br>Europe and the US needed to work together to revisit their
<br>counter-terrorism strategy (he would not call it a "war"
<br>because that would give legitimacy to the terrorists, he
<br>said), since the current strategy has not stemmed the tide of
<br>terrorism. Spain might call for a dialogue between the US
<br>and the EU on terrorism, to have a fresh discussion of
<br>strategy, identify what has worked and what has failed.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Ambassador Argyros also underscored areas in which
<br>the U.S. and Spain share common interests, such as Latin
<br>America, where both Spain and the U.S. have huge investments
<br>and an interest in stability and democracy. Moratinos agreed.
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) On the Middle East Moratinos mentioned the need to
<br>maintain the commitment to the Roadmap. He expressed deep
<br>concern, however, about the effect of the assassination just
<br>minutes before this meeting, by Israeli forces of the Hamas
<br>leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin. Moratinos had to break briefly
<br>from the meeting to give a statement to the Spanish press on
<br>the issue. He said that he considered this leader
<br>reprehensible, but was deeply concerned about the impact in
<br>the region of this "extra-judicial" killing (see paragraph 14
<br>for text of Moratinos' March 22 statement on Hamas killing).
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) At the close of the discussion, both the Ambassador
<br>and Moratinos agreed on the importance of building on the
<br>U.S.-Spanish ties relationship and our shared commitment to
<br>the war on terrorism. Ambassador Argyros throughout the
<br>meeting underscored the USG,s desire to work closely with
<br>the new government on issues of common concern, noting that,
<br>as among friends, there would be some issues on which we
<br>would have differences. Both also stressed the need to avoid
<br>developing our relationship through public rhetoric rather
<br>than private dialogue.
<br>
<br>¶13. (U) Moratinos' statement on Hamas killing, in interview
<br>on Spanish national radio: "It puts the situation in the
<br>Middle East and relations between Israel and Palestine back
<br>into a situation of a vicious circle of violence from which
<br>we are unable to emerge. Therefore I believe we all
<br>understand and we all share the state of Israel's security
<br>needs, but that cannot justify going outside the rule of law
<br>to fight terrorism when there are commitments to respect the
<br>rule of law, and that is what we have always said: these
<br>kinds of extrajudicial operations must be avoided and ended,
<br>because they only create greater cries for vengeance, greater
<br>unease and frustration among the Palestinian population."
