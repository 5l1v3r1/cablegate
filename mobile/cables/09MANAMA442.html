<br>SUBJECT: ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE VERSHBOW AND 
<br>AMBASSADOR ERELI MEET WITH KING HAMAD OF BAHRAIN 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Adam Ereli for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: In a July 22 meeting with Assistant Secretary 
<br>of Defense for International Security Affairs, Ambassador 
<br>Alexander Vershbow, and the U.S. Ambassador to Bahrain, Adam 
<br>Ereli, King Hamad of Bahrain was unwavering in his support 
<br>for United States policies in the Gulf, welcomed any new 
<br>requests the U.S. may need from Bahrain, voiced strong 
<br>support for U.S. actions in Afghanistan and Iraq, and said he 
<br>was ready to play a positive role toward Israel.  However, he 
<br>voiced strong "annoyance" at Qatari behavior, particularly 
<br>the recent visit of Qatar's Chief of Staff of its Armed 
<br>Forces to Iran, as well as Qatari rebuffs to Bahraini 
<br>requests for natural gas.  END SUMMARY 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) King Hamad warmly welcomed Ambassadors Vershbow and 
<br>Ereli and began the meeting by thanking the United States for 
<br>the staunch support we provide Bahrain.  He reminded the 
<br>Ambassadors that Bahrain is a long-time U.S. ally, remains 
<br>firm in its support of U.S. efforts in the Gulf, and greatly 
<br>values our bilateral relationship that is of significant 
<br>importance to Bahrain's interests.  He said Bahrain will do 
<br>anything to work together with the U.S.  He was particularly 
<br>praiseworthy of the bilateral defense relationship, 
<br>commenting that the superb advice Bahrain's Defense Forces 
<br>(BDF) receive from the U.S. has resulted in the BDF being one 
<br>of the cleanest organizations in Bahrain's government.  The 
<br>King also noted that the equipment received through the 
<br>Foreign Military Financing (FMF) process was of high quality 
<br>and operationally effective, and he was also proud of the 
<br>strong relations established with U.S. 5th Fleet. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) Ambassador Vershbow thanked His Majesty for hosting 
<br>the Military Consultative Committee that was currently 
<br>meeting in Manama and for his country's support to U.S. 
<br>interests.  He noted that the U.S.-Bahraini relationship was 
<br>very strong and mutually beneficial and affirmed to the King 
<br>that the U.S. and Bahrain shared a similar vision in the 
<br>region despite its many challenges. 
<br> 
<br>-------------------- 
<br>Afghanistan and Iraq 
<br>-------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) Turning to Afghanistan and Iraq, King Hamad said the 
<br>upcoming deployment of Bahrain's Ministry of Interior (MoI) 
<br>security unit to provide fixed site security in Afghanistan 
<br>would provide great experience to MoI personnel and allows 
<br>Bahrain to show its flag and demonstrate support for the 
<br>Coalition.  He stated that U.S. involvement in Afghanistan 
<br>provided a golden opportunity for the Afghan people to build 
<br>their country's security forces as well as their education, 
<br>medical, science and trade programs and ministries.  The King 
<br>added that U.S. efforts should be touted more in the media. 
<br>He quoted President Eisenhower, saying the "U.S. is 
<br>soldiering for peace and not waging war" and he understood 
<br>that the U.S. was not seeking to rule over Afghanistan or 
<br>Iraq.  He is convinced that the U.S. is in both places to 
<br>help the Afghan and Iraqi people and he was appreciative of 
<br>our armed forces personnel performing their duties in places 
<br>so far from home.  King Hamad noted some instability in Iraq, 
<br>but thought overall, Iraq was on a positive slope.  ASD 
<br>Vershbow thanked the King for his comments and said it was 
<br>important that the world hears his, as well as similar 
<br>explanations, of U.S. policies in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) Commenting on Bahrain's participation in coalition 
<br>maritime operations and efforts against terrorism and piracy, 
<br>King Hamad said he had recently told his Parliament that, 
<br>"Ships are sailing to defend the region and why don't we join 
<br>them?  If we don't join, we will miss an opportunity."  His 
<br>remarks acknowledged Bahrain's past and current participation 
<br>in Combined Task Force (CTF) 152 and its anticipated 
<br>participation in CTF 151. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------- 
<br>Annoyed and Concerned about Qatar 
<br>--------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) The King voiced concern about what is happening in the 
<br>region and stated that he would like to see a stronger Gulf 
<br>Cooperation Council (GCC) as a deterrent against future 
<br>threats and to provide more security in the region.  King 
<br>Hamad flatly stated that Bahrain is not happy with Qatar. He 
<br>took particular exception to the recent visit to Iran by 
<br>Qatar's Chief of Staff, MG Hamad al Attiyah.  He noted that 
<br>during the visit, the two sides released a statement agreeing 
<br>to joint training exercises, intelligence exchange and 
<br> 
<br>MANAMA 00000442  002 OF 002 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>reciprocal visits of military staff and units.  "This is 
<br>going too far," King Hamad fumed.  It's one thing to have 
<br>trade and commercial exchanges, he noted, but to welcome 
<br>Iranian military units on the territory of a GCC member state 
<br>is "a strategic matter."  He went on to say that Iran is the 
<br>number-one threat in the region; any country should be 
<br>cautious about exchanging military information with Iran, and 
<br>no GCC country should allow an Iranian military unit or 
<br>personnel to land on its shores.  The King stated that he 
<br>would like to show Qatar some type of unhappiness for its 
<br>actions with Iran. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) The King said it is rumored that MG al-Attiyah may 
<br>retire as the Qatari CHOD and perhaps this influenced his 
<br>decision to visit Iran.  (NOTE:  In a separate meeting with 
<br>ASD Vershbow and State P/M Assistant Secretary Shapiro, 
<br>during their July 20-21 visit to Doha, MG al-Attiyah did 
<br>state that his visit to Iran was long planned but perhaps 
<br>ill-timed to coincide with recent post-election activities in 
<br>Tehran; since it was previously planned, he had not wanted to 
<br>cancel his visit. END NOTE.) King Hamad added that Qatar's 
<br>behavior "is an annoyance, but it was too early to be angry 
<br>at them."  King Hamad went on saying he "would like our 
<br>brother in Saudi Arabia to send a note telling Qatar not to 
<br>play like this." 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (C) ASD Vershbow affirmed U.S. displeasure with Iranian 
<br>behavior, particularly its nuclear program, and stated the 
<br>U.S. would not tolerate Iranian pursuit of nuclear weapons. 
<br>He told the King we were disappointed with the timing of the 
<br>Qatari CHOD's visit, but hoped the Qataris could persuade 
<br>Iran to engage with the U.S. to end its nuclear program, 
<br>rather than seeking a confrontation with the international 
<br>community. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------- 
<br>Plug for the Crown Prince 
<br>------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C) ASD Vershbow said he appreciated the Crown Prince's 
<br>recent op-ed published on the Middle East which he understood 
<br>bore the King's stamp.  He said the Crown Prince's points 
<br>about Arab countries seizing the opportunity at hand and 
<br>setting aside past differences to move forward on the peace 
<br>process was right on mark.   King Hamad responded that 
<br>Bahrain supported U.S.-led efforts to make peace and agreed 
<br>that the Arab world needed to contribute positively to this 
<br>effort.  Returning to Qatar, King Hamad noted that Abdul Bari 
<br>al Atwan, the editor-in-chief of the pan-Arab daily "Al Quds 
<br>al Arabi," had written a widely-read article critical of the 
<br>Crown Prince's op-ed.  Qatar is a major financial backer of 
<br>al Quds al Arabi, the King remarked, and he clearly saw the 
<br>hand of Doha behind Abdul Bari's attack.  Continuing on this 
<br>theme, King Hamad said there were two major issues that made 
<br>him angry with regard to Qatar.  The first was the Iran 
<br>issue; the second was gas.  For years, Bahrain has been 
<br>asking to buy Qatari gas, but their response has always been 
<br>that Qatar exports were maxed out and it was not prepared to 
<br>enter into new supply contracts.  These rejections 
<br>notwithstanding, the King asserted that he had recently 
<br>learned that Qatar has inked a new supply deal with Mexico 
<br>and will increase gas supplies to England. He was at a loss 
<br>to understand Qatari behavior. 
<br> 
<br>--------- 
<br>On Israel 
<br>--------- 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (C) Commenting on Bahraini initiatives with Israel, King 
<br>Hamad said Bahrain continues to do its best to make Bahrain's 
<br>position clear to Israel and the world, and expressed thanks 
<br>for President Obama's recent detailed letter.  He was taking 
<br>his time in drafting a similarly detailed response, and would 
<br>share his response with Ambassador Ereli when it was ready. 
<br>King Hamad said he looks forward to cooperating more with the 
<br>U.S. on key regional issues and specifically referenced the 
<br>soon to be executed moves of P-3 aircraft to Isa Air Base and 
<br>DoD's location of its forward Near East South Asia (NESA) 
<br>Center to Manama.  ASD Vershbow and AMB Ereli thanked the 
<br>King for his strong support for U.S. policies and encouraged 
<br>Bahrain to continue its constructive behavior and leadership 
<br>in the Gulf. 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (U) ASD Vershbow has cleared this message.
