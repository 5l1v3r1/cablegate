<br>Classified By: Charge d'Affaires Todd Chapman for reasons 1.4 (b+d) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) SUMMARY: Mozambique has been called the second 
<br>most active narcotics transit point in Africa after Guinea 
<br>Bissau (Ref C). Despite anti-corruption rhetoric, the ruling 
<br>FRELIMO party has not shown much serious political will to 
<br>combat narcotrafficking. Mohamed Bashir Suleman (MBS), 
<br>described as the largest narcotrafficker in Mozambique, has 
<br>direct ties to President Guebuza and former President 
<br>Chissano. Other traffickers bribe both high and low level 
<br>officials. Chief of Customs Domingos Tivane is a significant 
<br>recipient of these narcotrafficking-related bribes. Police 
<br>officials told Embassy officers that they are unwilling to go 
<br>after "big fish" narcotraffickers because of their ties to 
<br>senior officials. The Ministries of Interior and Finance 
<br>have recently back-pedaled on U.S. efforts to engage and 
<br>assist in narcotrafficking and money laundering, a 
<br>significant associated problem. The management of the port 
<br>of Nacala, infamous for allowing the flow of drug 
<br>transshipments from southwest Asia, was recently taken over 
<br>by Celso Correia, principal of Insitec, Ltd, a Guebuza front 
<br>company. A new casino law reduces gambling restrictions in 
<br>Mozambique, providing another avenue for money laundering. 
<br>U.S. support to Border Security and the Mozambican military 
<br>(FADM) has resulted in modest seizures of money and drugs. 
<br>Post looks forward to an upcoming INL visit to help elaborate 
<br>a comprehensive counter-narcotics trafficking (CNT) strategy. 
<br>Any such CNT strategy, after first gauging political will 
<br>which at this point is suspect, should consider the 
<br>strengthening of land and maritime border security, 
<br>professionalization of the police force, educational 
<br>programming for prosecutors on Mozambican CNT laws already in 
<br>place, and development of a financial intelligence 
<br>capability. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br>NARCOTRAFFICKERS BLANDISHING GRM AND FRELIMO 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) Mohamed Bashir Suleman (MBS), described by 
<br>multiple contacts as the largest narcotrafficker in 
<br>Mozambique, contributes heavily to FRELIMO's coffers, and has 
<br>provided significant financial backing to the campaigns of 
<br>former President Joaquim Chissano and current President 
<br>Armando Guebuza. (Note: See TD-314/085221-09 regarding 
<br>written communication from the Office of the Presidency 
<br>directing certain containers be exempted from standard 
<br>scanning and scrutiny at the Port of Maputo. End Note.) 
<br>Traffickers, including MBS, Gulam Rassul, and the Ayoub 
<br>Family (Ref A) routinely bribe police, immigration and 
<br>customs officials to ensure that drugs can enter the country. 
<br>Domingos Tivane, Chief of the Customs Service, is a 
<br>significant recipient of bribes from narcotraffickers (Ref 
<br>B), and he recently purchased real estate in Maputo valued at 
<br>well beyond what his government salary should be able to 
<br>afford. 
<br>
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br>POLICE UNWILLING TO PURSUE MANY DRUG CASES 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) Senior members of the Mozambican Police (PRM) have 
<br>told Emboffs that potential CNT training would only help them 
<br>with small-scale traffickers, while other "big fish" would 
<br>remain too large to catch. Of the more than ten cocaine and 
<br>heroin seizures in 2009 at the Maputo airport, none have 
<br>resulted in prosecutions. A senior law enforcement official 
<br>has admitted to Emboffs that most drug seizures are not made 
<br>public and not prosecuted because police and customs 
<br>officials use such seizures to enrich themselves. Such 
<br>officials extract bribes, and may retain the drugs seized for 
<br>resale. Despite repeated requests, the Minister of Interior 
<br>(charged with overall responsibility for police and for 
<br>counter-narcotics) has refused to meet with the CDA to 
<br>discuss increased joint CNT efforts. The GRM recently raised 
<br>objections to an offer for a U.S. Department of Treasury 
<br>official to be embedded into the Financial Crimes Unit, after 
<br>initially agreeing to and supporting the offer. 
<br>

<br>PROVINCIAL PORTS ATTRACTIVE FOR DRUG TRANSITS 
<br>
<br>MAPUTO 00000080 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) The port of Nacala in particular is believed to be 
<br>a major recipient of narcotics from Southwest Asia. In July 
<br>2009, Celso Correia, who is a principal in Insitec, Ltd, (a 
<br>company whose major shareholder is President Armando 
<br>Guebuza-septel), was installed as head of the Northern 
<br>Development Corridor (CDN) which includes the port of Nacala 
<br>and the northern rail network. Shortly thereafter, Ghulam 
<br>Rassul Moti, who has smuggled hashish and heroin into 
<br>northern Mozambique since at least 1993 (Ref B) greatly 
<br>reduced bribes to local Nacala and Nampula municipal 
<br>authorities and made the payments instead directly to senior 
<br>FRELIMO officials. Nampula Mayor Castro Serafim was reported 
<br>to be particularly irritated that these monthly payments had 
<br>been re-routed straight to higher-level FRELIMO leaders. 
<br>
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>NEW CASINO LAW CAUSE FOR CONCERN 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S) In January, President Guebuza signed into law a new 
<br>"Casino Bill." Passed by the National Assembly (AR) in June 
<br>2009, the law relaxes restrictions on gambling in Mozambique, 
<br>reducing the minimum investment for a casino from $15 to $8 
<br>million, legalizing online gambling, and allowing slot 
<br>machines to be positioned in otherwise non-gambling 
<br>environments. The law also passes financial control of 
<br>casinos from the Ministry of Finance to the less rigorous 
<br>Ministry of Tourism. This bill was passed to encourage 
<br>tourism; however, given Mozambique's minimal financial 
<br>controls, the law will effectively reduce the barriers to 
<br>narcotraffickers looking to launder funds. Nazir Lunat, a 
<br>FRELIMO parliamentarian and influential imam in Maputo, 
<br>recently resigned from his position in the National Assembly 
<br>(AR) because of concerns over the law allowing casino 
<br>liberalizations. 
<br>
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br>USG SUPPORT HAS HAD POSITIVE OUTCOMES 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) With USG support, there has been some progress in 
<br>combating drug trafficking. Using INL funds, Embassy Maputo, 
<br>working with the Embassy of Portugal, provided training to 
<br>border guards which resulted in the seizure of U.S. $2.5 
<br>million in cash and the arrest of two Pakistani smugglers 
<br>(Ref E). In mid-May 2009 police seized U.S. $5 million in 
<br>heroin at the Ressano Garcia border crossing into South 
<br>Africa. Employing 7-meter, rigid hull inflatable boats 
<br>donated by the DoD using Section 1206 funds, the Mozambican 
<br>navy has interdicted several drug shipments near the coast, 
<br>most recently in December. 
<br>
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br>COMMENT: COMPREHENSIVE CNT STRATEGY NEEDED 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶8. (S) Post looks forward to an upcoming INL visit to help 
<br>elaborate a comprehensive CNT strategy. USG interests in CNT 
<br>in Mozambique involve multiple USG departments, including 
<br>State, DoD, DoJ, DHS, and Treasury. Our CNT strategy must 
<br>first address ways to strengthen the GRM's political will to 
<br>address narcotrafficking, while preparing Mozambique with a 
<br>host of programs, to include strengthening of land and 
<br>maritime border security, professionalization of the police 
<br>force, educational programming for prosecutors on Mozambican 
<br>CNT laws already in place, and development of a financial 
<br>intelligence capability.<br>
