<br>
<br>REF: BAGHDAD 2316
<br>
<br>Classified By: Deputy Political Counselor Greg D'Elia for reasons 1.4 (
<br>b) and (d).
<br>
<br>This is a PRT Karbala Reporting Cable
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) Summary: Since Iraq's liberation, Tehran has sought to
<br>increase its sway within Karbala and other key Shi'a holy
<br>cities. Iranian agents make use of direct payments and
<br>business favors to ensure that provincial government figures
<br>remain compliant and favorably inclined to Iranian interests.
<br>Shamsah Travel and Tourism, the dominant organization
<br>handling Iranian pilgrims, is reportedly a front for Iranian
<br>authorities and intelligence activities. While local
<br>politicians and businessmen at times contest Shamsah's reach,
<br>its influence is pervasive. End Summary.
<br>
<br>Iran's Karbala Campaign
<br>-----------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) As the site of Imam Husayn's martyrdom, and the
<br>birthplace of the twelfth imam, Karbala holds tremendous
<br>religious significance for Shi'a Muslims in general and
<br>Iranian "twelvers" in particular. Iraq's liberation in 2003
<br>has led to a dramatic increase in travel from Iran, providing
<br>Tehran with the opportunity to increase its control here.
<br>Iran's Karbala campaign can be divided into two phases,
<br>according to knowledgeable contacts. The first, beginning
<br>with the liberation and lasting until 2006, featured the
<br>ham-fisted backing of militias such as the Jaysh al-Mahdi
<br>(JAM) and the Badr Corps. As it became clear that Karbala
<br>residents were fed up with violence and blamed Iran, Tehran
<br>shifted to the more subtle tack of using its funds to build
<br>relationships with local government officials in order to
<br>solidify the central role of Iranian businesses in the
<br>province -- especially businesses servicing the estimated one
<br>million religious visitors per year traveling to Karbala from
<br>Iran.
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) By stressing its religious duty to help maintain the
<br>shrines of Imam Husayn and Imam Abbas, and its obligation to
<br>look after Iranian citizens here, Tehran is able to dress its
<br>Karbala operations in the cloak of legitimacy. According to
<br>government and private-sector contacts, the mechanism through
<br>which it exerts its influence is Shamsah Travel and Tourism.
<br>They describe Shamsah as an umbrella organization comprising
<br>some 2,500 Iranian companies, closely linked to the Iranian
<br>Government. Because of Shamsah's reported size and reach,
<br>and because our contacts in local government and the tourism
<br>industry are adamant that it faces no competition from other
<br>Iranian entities, we believe Shamsah is identifiable with the
<br>Kosar Organization. Described by the National Council of
<br>Resistance of Iran as the soft arm of the Qods Force, Kosar
<br>is designed to set up logistics support for Iranian agents
<br>through business and charitable activities.
<br>
<br>Shamsah's Agents
<br>----------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) Out of 170 hospitality enterprises (hotels,
<br>restaurants, travel and tourism businesses) that applied to
<br>Shamsah in 2007 for the opportunity to provide services to
<br>Iranian visitors in Karbala, only six were selected
<br>initially. Contacts report that Shamsah's primary agent is a
<br>50-something former resident of Kut named Kareem al-Musawi.
<br>He operates two tourism companies selected: Al-Diyar and
<br>Al-Janoub. Described as motivated by money, he also owns
<br>several hotels, a mineral water company, and a dairy. Some
<br>of these businesses allegedly were financed by Tehran, along
<br>with homes in the Islamic Republic that he visits regularly.
<br>Al-Musawi is widely perceived here as having access to
<br>"unlimited" Iranian funding. He distributes 10,000-dinar
<br>(800 USD) "grants" to the poor and is believed to financially
<br>support Provincial Council (PC) Acting Chairman Abd al-Al
<br>al-Yasiri (ISCI), according to multiple contacts in local
<br>government.
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) Another important Shamsah agent is Mohammad al-Yakubi,
<br>a Fadilah-affiliated PC member. He controls the Al-Rafideen
<br>and Qasr al-Mustafa tourism companies here and is the uncle
<br>of Hamoud Mohsen al-Yakubi, chairman of the National Tourism
<br>Committee. A third Shamsah agent identified by our contacts
<br>is Abd al-Kareem al-Unayzi, a Da'wa-affiliated member of the
<br>Iraqi Council of Representatives (CoR). He owns the Al-Taf
<br>Travel Agency in Karbala. The sixth hospitality business
<br>Shamsah selected is the Jarash Company; our contacts do not
<br>know who owns it.
<br>
<br>¶6. (S) Within the last six months, Shamsah reportedly
<br>selected two more local affiliates: The Sadr
<br>
<br>BAGHDAD 00002812 002 OF 002
<br>
<br>
<br>organization-controlled Al-Sununu Travel Agency and the
<br>Al-Manar Company for Tourism, which is owned by Hadi
<br>al-Amari, chairman of the CoR's Security and Defense
<br>Committee. The eight companies selected by Shamsah agreed to
<br>arrange to house, feed, and transport Iranian pilgrims for
<br>136 USD each for seven days (four nights in Karbala and three
<br>nights in Najaf), according to our contacts. As the primary
<br>agent, al-Musawi receives 25 USD out of every 136 USD payment
<br>and, in exchange, coerces local hotels into servicing the
<br>Iranians for 111 USD each, even though this amount barely
<br>covers costs. Our contacts report that al-Musawi threatens
<br>to withdraw the Iranian business if the hotel owners balk;
<br>with the majority of visitors to Karbala coming from the
<br>Islamic Republic, hoteliers face a Hobson's choice between
<br>empty rooms and rooms full of underpaying guests.
<br>
<br>The Central Kitchen
<br>-------------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) In early 2007, Shamsah opened the Central Kitchen (aka
<br>the Iranian Kitchen) in Karbala. Publicly, at least, the
<br>idea was to provide Iranians with food to which they were
<br>accustomed; Persian pilgrims supposedly had complained that
<br>they could not stomach the local Iraqi fare. In the run-up
<br>to last year's Shabaniyah observances, local hoteliers,
<br>butchers, and green grocers -- seeing the Central Kitchen,
<br>with its imported foods and workers, as an intensification of
<br>Shamsah's threat to their livelihoods -- complained to Abd
<br>al-Mahdi al-Karbala'i, Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani's deputy.
<br>Al-Karbala'i contacted the PC, which then voted to close the
<br>Central Kitchen. Al-Musawi countered by lobbying individual
<br>PC members -- particularly al-Yasiri -- and prevailing upon
<br>the eight local companies with which Shamsah does business to
<br>write to Governor Aqeel Hamoud al-Khazali asking for the PC's
<br>decision to be overruled. Our PC and tourism industry
<br>contacts claim that Iranian Ambassador Hasan Kadhum Qomi
<br>personally lobbied PC Tourism Committee Chairman Hasan
<br>al-Furati, and that al-Musawi threatened to "crush and kill"
<br>some of the hotel owners (Note: One hotel owner told us
<br>that he was informed by a friend at the Interior Ministry
<br>that a "file" had been opened on him at al-Musawi's behest
<br>and that his case was being examined by Karbala intelligence
<br>chief Gen. Razaq, aka "Abu Amal," who belongs to ISCI/Badr.
<br>End Note.)
<br>
<br>¶8. (S) In response to the lobbying and letters, Aqeel asked
<br>Karbala's Hotel and Restaurant League for its opinion on the
<br>Central Kitchen. The League responded that its members had
<br>no objection to the Central Kitchen per se, but insisted that
<br>it use Iraqi workers and purchase food and supplies from
<br>Iraqi vendors. The PC, meanwhile, formed a special
<br>committee, led by member Hamid al-Turfi (ISCI), to study the
<br>issue. In January, 2008, al-Turfi's committee upheld the
<br>decision to close the Central Kitchen. It defiantly remained
<br>open until March, 2008, when it forcibly was closed by the
<br>Iraqi Police.
<br>
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶9. (S) As many Karbala pilgrims inevitably hail from Iran,
<br>the dominance of an Iranian-connected company should not
<br>surprise, though Shamsah,s coercive methods and reputed
<br>proxy intelligence role send a disturbing signal. Acting PC
<br>Chairman Al-Yasiri's incompetence (see reftel) and the
<br>Central Kitchen brouhaha show that Iranian actors in the
<br>region, economic or otherwise, are not infallible. PRT has
<br>concerns that Shamsah Director al-Musawi and his confreres
<br>are hard at work lining the pockets of likely candidates in
<br>the provincial elections. Al-Yasiri's survival to date,
<br>attributable to the PC's failure in several attempts to
<br>assemble a quorum for a vote to oust him, wryly has been
<br>described by some here as a "miracle;" official contacts
<br>suggest Iranian money convinced some members not to appear.
<br>The longer that provincial elections are delayed, the more
<br>time Tehran and its local allies have to cook up similar,
<br>unpleasant, surprises. End comment.
