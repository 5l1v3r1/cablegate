<br>AND D. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Summary 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (S/NF) In a July 20 plenary session of the GSD with a large UAE 
<br>delegation, accompanied by a smaller session with the UAE Chief of 
<br>Staff, the immediate focus was largely on Iran.  Participants 
<br>reiterated the good defense cooperation that the U.S. and UAE enjoy, 
<br>while noting the need to improve coordination further to deal with 
<br>real and urgent threats in the region. In this regard, the  UAE put 
<br>the threat of Iran's potential reaction to a "likely" Israeli attack 
<br>on its nuclear program at the center of scenarios to be considered. 
<br>Other issues, to include Yemen, counter-proliferation, Pakistan, the 
<br>Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and extremism were also addressed, but 
<br>even these were often seen through the prism of Iranian intentions. 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (S/NF) This message begins with the Chief of Staff's urgent plea 
<br>on "munitions" to deal with an unpredictable Iran, followed by a 
<br>synopsis of GSD plenary proceedings.  A list of UAE participants is 
<br>included at para 20.  End summary. 
<br> 
<br>Chief of Staff Presses for Munitions: 
<br>Urgent about Iran's unpredictability 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (S/NF) In a brief session with principals only, Chief of Staff 
<br>Hamad Thani al-Romaithi (who also participated in the MbZ dinner and 
<br>was on his way to Lebanon later July 20) said the UAE cannot act 
<br>alone in the region and needs coherent plans -- especially to deal 
<br>with the unique threat of Iran.  How to deter Iran without provoking 
<br>it is a challenge.  Ambassador al-Otaiba emphasized how the proximity 
<br>of the UAE to Iran magnifies the threat perception; the CoS said UAE 
<br>military planning had to consider worst-case scenarios. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (S/NF) ASD Vershbow said the USG did not disagree with the UAE 
<br>evaluation of Iran's objectives, but that we need to work to prevent 
<br>them from achieving those objectives.  Diplomacy is only one tool. 
<br>The USG wants to help provide the UAE with defensive capabilities and 
<br>our troop presence here should help act as a deterrent to Iran.  We 
<br>don't want to signal that we will give up on diplomacy, yet in 
<br>parallel to that effort we intend to keep the pressure on Iran.  We 
<br>appreciate the candor of our defense engagement with the UAE.  We are 
<br>dealing with an unpredictable foe and need to take all precautions. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (S/NF) The CoS said Iran will remain a threat in any case, as its 
<br>objectives are constant.  He added that if the Israelis strike, Iran 
<br>may lash out at the UAE and around the Gulf -- one can conceive of 
<br>many possible scenarios from missile strikes to attacks on isolated 
<br>islands to the exploitation of 130,000 Iranians living in the UAE. 
<br>The UAE therefore seeks ongoing support from the region's "main 
<br>actor," the U.S., and desires close defense coordination.  The UAE's 
<br>friends in the GCC, on the other hand, are not always realistic in 
<br>their approach to Iran, he said, citing Arab misinterpretation of 
<br>"brotherly" Iraqi intentions with regards to Kuwait back in 1990. 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (S/NF) ASD Vershbow said that our message to Iran is that threats 
<br>against our allies will not go unanswered.  We need to be prepared in 
<br>case deterrence does not work, with the realization that with or 
<br>without nuclear weapons Iran seeks to be a dominant power in the 
<br>region.  This is a very interconnected region, asserted the CoS.  "If 
<br>I was in the Israelis' shoes, I would attack, to reduce the nuclear 
<br>threat."  The first reaction may be that the Iranians launch missiles 
<br>against targets in Israel and then the Gulf, he added.  Air Chief 
<br>Sweidan added that the UAE needs munitions on a tighter timeline than 
<br>previously assumed -- with urgent needs in 2010, 11, and 12.  He said 
<br>the UAE Armed Forces could receive munitions from the U.S. inventory 
<br>and then replenish them later (he supplied the same list of 
<br>requirements as was relayed some months ago, noting that they had 
<br>only received a "political" answer to that inquiry thus far). 
<br>

<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (S/NF) The CoS was appreciative of Patriot deployments, progress 
<br>on command and control systems, and movement toward more effective 
<br>shared early warning, but lamented that other pieces of the air 
<br>defense puzzle require immediate attention.  Ambassador al-Otaiba 
<br>reiterated the need to "borrow from U.S. inventories" to meet urgent 
<br>timelines.  A/S Vershbow said we were leaning far forward for the UAE 
<br>on THAAD, for example, and would continue to look into opportunities 
<br>to assist, including filling gaps before UAE-purchased systems were 
<br>delivered. 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (S/NF) Highlighting the importance of close defense coordination, 
<br>the CoS noted that in the event of an attack the UAE may have no time 
<br>to react.  Taking the fight to Iran may require "passing over U.S. 
<br>aircraft carriers," for example, so we need to be in lock-step at all 
<br>phases of preparation and operation. 
<br> 
<br>Introductory remarks 
<br>-------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (C) The Plenary session of the U.S.-UAE Gulf Security Dialogue 
<br>(GSD) convened July 20 at the Armed Forces Officers' Club, with newly 
<br>promoted Deputy Chief of Staff Major General Ali Hamad Subaih 
<br>al-Kaabi stating that the "small but significant" Gulf region makes a 
<br>large contribution to global peace and development and seeks enhanced 
<br>cooperation with the U.S.  He cited UAE troops in Afghanistan, U.S. 
<br>use of UAE bases, a robust intelligence exchange, strong 
<br>counter-terror efforts, and improved border control as evidence that 
<br>the UAE shares common goals with the U.S.  Citing the "high 
<br>importance" of strong relations among GCC members, he thanked the 
<br>U.S. for its role in the defense relationship and wanted to learn 
<br>more about U.S. strategies vis-a-vis Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq, and 
<br>Palestine. 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (C) Assistant Secretary of Defense Vershbow, leading the U.S. 
<br>team along with Assistant State of State for Political-Military 
<br>AffairsShapiro, expressed confidence in the strength and future of 
<br>the bilateral relationship, anchored by common strategic interests. 
<br>Recounting shared priorities, he noted that the GSD was being taken 
<br>to a new level as we seek strategic synergy in facing real threats 
<br>like Iran -- which we are obligated to defend against.  He called for 
<br>a more multi-lateral approach to counter-proliferation and cited the 
<br>need to prepare missile defenses.  He lauded the UAE decision to host 
<br>LEADING EDGE 2009 and cited the 123 agreement with the U.S. as the 
<br>high standard on civil nuclear cooperation.  The responsible drawdown 
<br>of U.S. troops in Iraq also calls for continued UAE support, he 
<br>emphasized, as Iraq seeks to assume responsibility for its own 
<br>security and integrate into the region.  The UAE's advanced fighter 
<br>squadron, growing air defense net, participation in RED FLAG, and 
<br>leadership of CTF 152 are all indications of a maturing defense 
<br>capability. 
<br> 
<br>¶11.  (C)  A/S Shapiro emphasized the USG desire to ensure regional 
<br>stability, counter extremism, curb WMD proliferation, and tackle the 
<br>inter-related challenges of the region holistically.  He focused on 
<br>the threat from Iran, stressing that the USG was attempting a 
<br>diplomatic solution -- if possible -- and would proceed in 
<br>consultation with our friends in the region.  Recounting the basic 
<br>components of our Iraq policy, he also highlighted the need to 
<br>strengthen the institutions of government in Lebanon and build 
<br>capacity within the Palestinian Authority. 
<br> 
<br>UAE offers threat analysis: all Iran 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶12.  (S) The UAE's presentation of the primary regional threat 
<br>assessed that Iran's leadership "genuinely believes that it has 
<br>emerged victorious from its clash with the U.S.," with gains made in 
<br>Iraq, an expanding "Shi'a tide" in the region, an ongoing nuclear 
<br>program, missile modernization, and continued provocation of 
<br>resistance in Gaza.  While Israel was able to neutralize to some 
<br>degree threats on its flanks in Lebanon (2006) and Gaza (2008/9), 
<br> 
<br>ABU DHABI 00000744  003 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Iran's main goals of regional influence were not inhibited.  The UAE 
<br>assessment continued that Israel may act on its perception that only 
<br>"extreme" (and unlikely) UNSC action or unilateral Israeli military 
<br>action can slow Iran's nuclear goals.  As Iran continues to reject a 
<br>political solution, the UAE must prepare for the fallout should 
<br>Israel act on its fears.  With that, the briefer introduced a slide 
<br>on Iran's capabilities, with missile sites in the south of Iran and 
<br>concentric circles showing their likely range all covering UAE 
<br>territory. 
<br> 
<br>¶13.  (S) Iranian promotion of "Shi'ism," coupled with sleeper cells 
<br>in the region, magnify the threat articulated by the UAE.  If 
<br>attacked, it may seek to obstruct shipping in the Gulf and control 
<br>(more) islands over which it does not have legitimate sovereignty. 
<br>Working in alliance with al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, and Iraqi Shi'a, Iran 
<br>is poised to do damage of an unpredictable nature if/when provoked. 
<br>In sum, Iran continued as the traditional focus of the threat 
<br>briefing offered by the UAE at GSD sessions.  Other regional concerns 
<br>noted in lesser detail included Iraq, Yemen, Afghanistan, Pakistan, 
<br>the Arab-Israeli conflict, terrorism, and piracy. 
<br> 
<br>Strategic Cooperation 
<br>--------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶14.  (C) In further briefings, the UAE team highlighted good 
<br>operational cooperation with the U.S. and offered a review of the 
<br>maturing Critical National Infrastructure Agency (CNIA) which is 
<br>taking charge of security on land, along the coast, and off shore -- 
<br>with an initial focus on Abu Dhabi but an intent to serve as a 
<br>federal agency.  The U.S. Coast Guard and NYPD were cited as partners 
<br>in the growing CNIA mission, with a U.S. promise of first-time 
<br>"Nuclear Security Training" in the near future. 
<br> 
<br>¶15.  (S) The UAE delegation received  a draft "UAE National Defense 
<br>Strategy and U.S.-UAE Comprehensive Defense Strategy" document 
<br>outlining key priorities in the defense relationship (a document 
<br>proposed by UAE Ambassador to Washington Yousef al-Otaiba).  Without 
<br>immediate comment on the substance of the USG draft, al-Kaabi said 
<br>the UAE would reply via embassy channels and looked forward to 
<br>continuing the dialogue. 
<br> 
<br>Q&A on Iran, Yemen 
<br>------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶16.  (C) When the floor was open to general discussion, two topics 
<br>dominated:  Iran and Yemen.  The UAE asked whether the USG had any 
<br>new information since the December 2007 NIE regarding Iran's nuclear 
<br>weaponization program; the U.S. team noted that a new estimate was in 
<br>progress but it was premature to comment.  The DMI representative 
<br>also noted that Iran exploits crises for its own advantage, making 
<br>the defusing of crises like Palestine and Lebanon imperative if we 
<br>are to keep Iran in check.  In the case of Palestine, he added 
<br>optimistically, it is time to "cut to the chase" and deal with final 
<br>status issues; Lebanon is also ripe for progress, he suggested, 
<br>without a drawn out process. 
<br> 
<br>¶17.  (S) On Yemen, the UAE said it shared a U.S. concern that a 
<br>"failed state" could emerge on the Arabian Peninsula, with terrorist 
<br>partners and Iranian influence further poisoning the mix.  A 
<br>collapsed Yemen "gives us Afghanistan," said Commander of the Air 
<br>Force and Air Defense Major General Hamad bin Suweidan al-Qamzi, and 
<br>then it presents a long-term threat to the region.  He said the UAE 
<br>was coordinating economic development support for Yemen while also 
<br>trying to assist with political reconciliation.  He noted the dangers 
<br>of "another Somalia."  ASD Vershbow hoped the UAE could help secure a 
<br>unified GCC approach to Yemen, as time is running out on the 
<br>seccession question and Yemen cannot afford a "two front" war with 
<br>both seccesionists and the Al-Houthi insurgency.  In a brief 
<br>discussion of Pakistan, all agreed that Islamabad needs to focus 
<br>resources to fight insurgency rather than obsessing with India as its 
<br>potential military foe. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>ABU DHABI 00000744  004 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Positive Conclusions 
<br>-------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶18.  (C) Enhanced U.S.-UAE cooperation to counter troublesome 
<br>financial flows and cash smuggling -- solidified during a recent 
<br>visit by Treasury Secretary Geithner -- was noted by the Charge as 
<br>another area of productive engagement.  Both sides also put in very 
<br>positive words about the role of the Air Warfare Center which has 
<br>become a proud center of excellence for the region. 
<br> 
<br>¶19.  (S) In closing, al-Kaabi raised Iran yet again, noting that its 
<br>leadership is not likely to change fundamentally and therefore the 
<br>threat is likely to continue.  He looked forward to ongoing 
<br>discussion of the defense strategy discussed earlier as we continue 
<br>to pursue a common vision.
