<br> 
<br>Classified By: DCM Luis G. Moreno, Reason 1.4 (b) (d) 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (C)  SUMMARY  During their trip to Israel, CODEL Cardin 
<br>discussed Iran, Syria, Israel-Palestinian negotiations, and 
<br>the Israeli elections with Likud Party leader and candidate 
<br>for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  Netanyahu described a 
<br>nuclear Iran as the greatest threat facing Israel, and urged 
<br>strong economic sanctions backed by a viable military option 
<br>to confront a problem that he said threatened the region and 
<br>could prove a "tipping point" in world history.  Describing 
<br>his approach to "economic peace" with the Palestinians, 
<br>Netanyahu suggested he would cut through bureaucratic 
<br>obstacles to Palestinian economic development to build a 
<br>"pyramid" from the "bottom up" that would strengthen the 
<br>Palestinian Authority, and offer the Palestinians  a viable 
<br>alternative to radicalism.  Netanyahu expressed support for 
<br>the concept of land swaps, and emphasized that he did not 
<br>want to govern the West Bank and Gaza but rather to stop 
<br>attacks from being launched from there.  Netanyahu suggested 
<br>Syrian interest in peace negotiations with Israel were really 
<br>overtures to the United States, and described the Syrians as 
<br>firmly in the Iranian camp.  Netanyahu expressed confidence 
<br>that President Peres would offer him rather than Kadima Party 
<br>leader Livni the opportunity of forming a coalition because 
<br>the bloc of center-right/right wing parties in the new 
<br>Knesset amounted to 65 seats.  Netanyahu said his desire 
<br>would be to form a unity government with Kadima, but would 
<br>not agree to a rotating prime ministership.  END SUMMARY 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (SBU)  As part of their February 14-17 visit to Israel, 
<br>CODEL Cardin met with Likud Party leader and candidate for 
<br>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on February 16 in 
<br>Jerusalem.  Netanyahu was at the center of intense political 
<br>speculation about the formation of a governing coalition 
<br>following the extremely close Israeli national election of 
<br>February 10, which did not produce a clear winner.  The CODEL 
<br>met with Netanyahu following meetings the previous day with 
<br>President Peres, and prior to meetings later in the day with 
<br>Prime Minister Olmert and Palestinian Authority Prime 
<br>Minister Fayyad. 
<br> 
<br>---- 
<br>IRAN 
<br>---- 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C)  Netanyahu quickly launched into his oft-stated 
<br>position that Iran is the greatest threat facing Israel. 
<br>Noting that "Persia" already had two bases on the 
<br>Mediterranean (referring to Hizballah and Hamas), Netanyahu 
<br>complained that Iran's "tentacles" were choking Israel, and 
<br>that a new one grew back whenever one was cut off.  Netanyahu 
<br>charged that Iran was developing nuclear weapons with the 
<br>express purpose of wiping out Israel, and described 
<br>preventing Iran from developing a nuclear capability as 
<br>Israel's  highest policy priority.  Netanyahu described five 
<br>threats that he saw emanating from Iranian nuclear 
<br>development: a direct threat to Israel; a direct threat to 
<br>other regional states; increased terrorist power under an 
<br>Iranian nuclear umbrella; a Middle East nuclear arms race; 
<br>and a destabilized Middle East, with  Arab regimes 
<br>"terrified" of Iran in his view.  Netanyahu, commenting that 
<br>he normally avoided political jargon, pointed to one phrase 
<br>that he said applied to this issue - "a tipping point." 
<br>According to Netanyahu, if Iran develops a nuclear weapon 
<br>capability it will "topple the peace process" and "change the 
<br>history of the world." 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (C)  When asked what advice he offered to the United 
<br>States, Netanyahu reported that he had spoken to 
<br>then-candidate Obama and said the method was less important 
<br>than the goal, and asked rhetorically whether the President 
<br>would allow Iran to "cross the nuclear threshold ... on his 
<br>watch."  Netanyahu suggested there were many ways to pressure 
<br>Iran, which he saw as economically weak at the moment due to 
<br>plunging oil prices at the same time that the U.S. President 
<br>had strong international backing, a situation Netanyahu 
<br>described as the opposite of the past few years.  He said he 
<br>would look forward (as Prime Minister) to discussing  with 
<br>President Obama concrete measures to be taken against Iran. 
<br>Netanyahu said these would not be a substitute for 
<br>Palestinian negotiations, but that any result from such 
<br>negotiations would be "washed away" by Iran's attaining a 
<br>nuclear bomb. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (C)  When asked how Iran could be isolated, Netanyahu 
<br>suggested a blockade as one possibility.  The nuclear program 
<br>could be stopped if the U.S. led the international community 
<br>to "ratchet up" economic sanctions, but that these sanctions 
<br>would only work if Iran knew that the U.S. military option 
<br>remained viable.  Netanyahu said he did not object to a U.S. 
<br>dialogue with Iran provided the talks were close ended, 
<br>perhaps two months, with fixed results, otherwise Iran would 
<br> 
<br>TEL AVIV 00000457  002 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>"take you to the cleaners."  He said he agreed with the 
<br>Europeans' urging the U.S. to postpone any talks until past 
<br>the Iranian elections in June.  Netanyahu said he did not 
<br>know for certain how close Iran was to developing a nuclear 
<br>weapons capability, but that "our experts" say Iran was 
<br>probably only one or two years away and that was why they 
<br>wanted open ended negotiations.  He again urged "tough 
<br>negotiations" if military means were not used  (and added 
<br>that Special Envoy Mitchell was both nice and tough.) 
<br>Netanyahu described the Iranian regime as crazy, retrograde, 
<br>and fanatical, with a Messianic desire to speed up a violent 
<br>"end of days."  That was not the whole country, however, in 
<br>his view, as he said that "75 percent of the Iranian people" 
<br>oppose the regime, but that it governed with terror and would 
<br>be hard to overthrow.  There was no single view from 
<br>Iranians, therefore, but there was from the powers that 
<br>dominate.  He reiterated that strong economic action could 
<br>stop their nuclear development or possibly even bring down 
<br>the regime - as could "the U.S. military process." 
<br> 
<br>----------------- 
<br>PALESTINIAN TRACK 
<br>----------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (C)  Turning to peace with the Palestinians, Netanyahu 
<br>said the reason  the process had not worked so far was that 
<br>while 70 percent of Israelis were willing to make 
<br>concessions, the same number were convinced that there was no 
<br>real Palestinian partner.  Netanyahu warned that when Israel 
<br>left Lebanon is created a first Iranian base, that when it 
<br>left Gaza it created a second Iranian base, and if Israel 
<br>"promised" a third retreat from the West Bank it would see 
<br>the same results.  There were three options, according to 
<br>Netanyahu - withdrawing to the 1967 borders (that would "get 
<br>terror, not peace"); doing nothing ("just as bad"); or 
<br>"rapidly building a pyramid from the ground up."  Netanyahu 
<br>suggested a rapid move to develop the West Bank economically, 
<br>including "unclogging" bureaucratic "bottlenecks."  He 
<br>promised to "take charge personally" (as Prime Minister) to 
<br>facilitate this bureaucratic reform, which would occur in 
<br>tandem with political negotiations and cooperation with 
<br>Jordan to build up Palestinian Authority security capacity. 
<br>Netanyahu noted that there  were larger demonstrations 
<br>against the  Gaza operation in Madrid and London than in the 
<br>West Bank.  He said this was because the West Bankers 
<br>recognized that Hamas represents  the prospect of "violent, 
<br>crazy" people in charge of their society; they  should be 
<br>offered real alternatives in order to have the strength to 
<br>resist the radicals. 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (C)  Netanyahu said his "new approach"  would also 
<br>include not continuing to fund a  "bloated" Palestinian 
<br>bureaucracy.  It would be aimed at direct development. 
<br>Netanyahu, noting that he had previously "turned around" the 
<br>Israeli economy (as Finance Minister), gave one example of a 
<br>problem he would fix as an electric powerline in the West 
<br>Bank that was held up by conflicting and competing agencies. 
<br>He said this powerline was needed and would create jobs, but 
<br>was held up not because the Palestinians were targeted, but 
<br>because that was how the Israeli bureaucracy worked for 
<br>everyone, including Israelis.  When asked whether these 
<br>reforms could include room to modify security arrangements, 
<br>Netanyahu agreed that some of what the GOI calls security is 
<br>in fact bureaucracy.  Pointing to what he described as strong 
<br>but unpublicized trade between Haifa port and Iraq via 
<br>Jordan, he suggested assembly points could be set up in the 
<br>West Bank for some goods, which would create thousands of 
<br>jobs.  This would not be a substitute for a political 
<br>settlement, according to Netanyahu, but economic prosperity 
<br>would make peace possible, as occurred in Northern Ireland. 
<br> 
<br>----- 
<br>SYRIA 
<br>----- 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (C)  Netanyahu said he was actually more optimistic about 
<br>dealing with the Palestinians than with Syria, because he was 
<br>confident that the Palestinian Authority wants Iran and its 
<br>proxies out.  He said he was less sanguine about Syria, which 
<br>he complained straddles the fence all the time.  The Syrians 
<br>might "talk about" a new (U.S.) relationship, but he did not 
<br>see them disconnecting from Iran.  Netanyahu suggested that 
<br>Israel "giving up" the Golan would just result in assurances 
<br>that Syria would later "tear up."  Describing King Hussein as 
<br>heroic, and noting that the King came from his "death bed" in 
<br>1998 to get then-Prime Minister Netanyahu and 
<br>then-Palestinian Authority Chairman Arafat to reach an 
<br>agreement at the Wye River talks, Netanyahu said that when 
<br>Saddam Hussein took Kuwait, even King Hussein "snuggled up" 
<br>to the Iraqi leader out of necessity.  Such is the reality in 
<br>the Middle East.

<br>COALITION FORMATION 
<br>------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (C)  Despite finishing one Knesset seat behind Kadima and 
<br>its candidate Tzipi Livni in the February 10 Israeli national 
<br>elections, Netanyahu expressed complete confidence that 
<br>President Peres would offer him the opportunity to form a 
<br>government because the bloc of center-right/right wing 
<br>parties in the new Knesset has 65 seats compared to Livni's 
<br>potential bloc of 45 seats for center-left/left wing parties 
<br>plus 11 seats for Arab parties.  Netanyahu said his desire 
<br>would be to form a unity government with Kadima, but would 
<br>not agree to a rotating prime ministership with Ms. Livni. 
<br>He explained that the one time Israel had a rotation came as 
<br>a result of an exact tie between the two political 
<br>coalitions, but this time the right wing bloc was much 
<br>larger. 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (C) When asked about Avigdor Lieberman's Yisrael 
<br>Beiteinu party, Netanyahu reminded the CODEL that Kadima had 
<br>in fact included Lieberman in their government in its earlier 
<br>stages.  Netanyahu stressed repeatedly that he preferred a 
<br>unity government, and said the large security and economic 
<br>problems facing Israel called for the strength that a unity 
<br>government would offer.  Livni "collapsed" left- wing votes 
<br>(from Labor and other parties) to score a one vote margin for 
<br>Kadima over Likud in the elections, but took no votes away 
<br>from the right, according to Netanyahu.  When asked what he 
<br>might offer to Kadima, Netanyahu suggested Kadima would get a 
<br>few key ministerial portfolios, but did not elaborate.  He 
<br>said that he while he was convinced a rotating Prime 
<br>Ministership would not happen, he was confident a unity 
<br>government could.  Netanyahu said the government would not 
<br>include the Arab parties. 
<br> 
<br>¶11.  (C)  Netanyahu promised that as Prime Minister his 
<br>government would not "go back" to unilateral withdrawals, and 
<br>would have a clear focus.  On the economy, he said Israel was 
<br>not a huge economy such as the United States or China, and 
<br>that he would be able to turn things around quickly, as "a 
<br>small share of a declining market" was big for Israel. Asked 
<br>about settlements, Netanyahu noted that he had not 
<br>established any new settlements when he was Prime Minister. 
<br>Half of the West Bank, the area east of the ridge line and 
<br>the Jordan Valley, is virtually unpopulated and only contains 
<br>a few settlements.  In the other half, Israeli and 
<br>Palestinian populations are intertwined.  Once the 
<br>Palestinian Authority develops into a real partner it will be 
<br>possible to negotiate an agreement over territory, 
<br>settlements and "refined" Palestinian sovereignty without an 
<br>army or control over air space and borders.  Netanyahu said 
<br>it would be too hard to negotiate agreements over Jerusalem 
<br>and refugees until the other issues are resolved.  Claiming 
<br>that many Palestinians accept this point, Netanyahu said he 
<br>was not talking about a delaying tactic but rather a 
<br>temporary freeze, adding that he hoped PA Prime Minister 
<br>Fayyad would still be around since Fayyad also thinks along 
<br>economic lines. 
<br> 
<br>¶12.  (SBU)  As an example of economic development, Netanyahu 
<br>spoke about expanding faith tourism.  He said that it "defied 
<br>imagination" that the well-known site on the Jordan River 
<br>where John the Baptist baptized Jesus was "paralyzed" by a 
<br>GOI/PA jurisdiction dispute.  With Jericho only a mile away, 
<br>Netanyahu offered to give an "easy", secure "envelope" for 
<br>transporting tourists from the Galilee to this part of the 
<br>West Bank.  That would lead to "co-production" that would 
<br>provide large revenue streams of tourist dollars to the 
<br>Palestinians, from a population that was already coming to 
<br>Israel.  He asked why Israelis would be  less disposed to 
<br>make concessions to a viable Palestinian government and 
<br>society.  Netanyahu agreed that West Bank checkpoints take 
<br>too long, and offered to look into express lanes, increased 
<br>staffing, and other possible solutions - as Prime Minister.
