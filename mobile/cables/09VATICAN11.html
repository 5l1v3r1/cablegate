<br>
<br>CLASSIFIED BY: Rafael P. Foley, Acting DCM.
<br>REASON: 1.4 (b), (d)
<br>¶1. (S) Summary: The Pope's decision to reinstate communion with
<br>a breakaway Catholic group that included a Holocaust-denying
<br>cleric (ref A) proved that his highest concern is the long-term
<br>religious well-being of the Church, not the Holy See's relations
<br>with other sovereign states. This religion-first attitude is
<br>also informing the Holy See's planning for the Pope's probable
<br>trip to Israel and Jordan next May (ref B) and its handling of a
<br>controversy over whether WWII Pope Pius XII should be declared a
<br>saint. Most Holy See insiders believe that this is the right
<br>approach for a 2,000 year-old institution which considers its
<br>greatest historical failure "the scandal of the Christian
<br>disunity." This said, Pope Benedict XVI -- himself a German who
<br>lived through WWII -- has publicly deplored anti-Semitism and
<br>emphasized improved relations with the Jews. The Holy See may
<br>find, however, that its politically tone-deaf handling of this
<br>decision may cool the Pope's reception in Israel this May, if
<br>the trip is confirmed). End Summary
<br>
<br>Broad Context, Long History for Vatican-Jewish Dialogue
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) In a lengthy discussion with CDA and A/DCM on January 23,
<br>the Secretary of the Holy See's Commission for Relations with
<br>the Jews, Father Norbert Hofmann, described Vatican-Jewish
<br>dialogue efforts. He noted that an odd organizational decision
<br>demonstrates just how important Catholic-Jewish relations are to
<br>the Vatican: the Commission for Relations with Jews comes under
<br>the Pontifical Council for the Promotion of Christian Unity --
<br>not/not the Pontifical Council on Inter-Religious Dialogue
<br>(which deals with relations with Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists and
<br>Animists). According to Hofmann, Jewish leaders appreciate this
<br>arrangement because it is to their advantage to underline the
<br>special relationship that bounds Christianity to Judaism.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Both religions accord major importance to dialogue.
<br>Since the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965), the Catholic
<br>Church has pursued closer ties with Judaism, citing their shared
<br>texts and history. In recent years, and coinciding with the
<br>election of German Pope Benedict XVI (who lived through WWII as
<br>a child), the effort to strengthen these ties has been kicked
<br>into high gear. Jews, Hofmann said, think good relations with
<br>the Holy See help combat anti-Semitism and ensure that there
<br>will never be another Shoa.
<br>
<br>Denial of Outrage about Perceived Affronts
<br>------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Hofmann opined that Pope Benedict XVI's reinstatement of
<br>the four Lefebvrist clerics excommunicated by Pope John Paul II
<br>(ref a) would not damage Vatican relations with the Jews over
<br>the long term. He anticipated that the public denial of the
<br>Holocaust by one of the four, Bishop Williamson, would be
<br>controversial and would attract criticism in the short term but
<br>then be set aside quickly. Other Church leaders seemed to agree
<br>that since the Pope's decision was religious, not political, it
<br>would be understood as such. The head of the French bishops'
<br>conference, for example, hailed the act as "a gesture of mercy
<br>and openness for strengthening Church unity." Other Church
<br>leaders disassociated themselves from Bishop Williamson's
<br>Holocaust denials, then adding words of welcome for the
<br>reinstatement of the four Lefebvrists. It fell mostly to
<br>Cardinal Kasper, who runs the Catholic-Jewish dialogue, to
<br>condemn the rehabilitated bishop's remarks as "stupid" and
<br>"unacceptable," and having "nothing to do with the Catholic
<br>Church." As is typical, the Pope stayed above the fray and did
<br>not comment.
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) Indeed, most Church leaders seem to think the damage from
<br>this matter will not last or harm the Pope's planned visit to
<br>Israel. Father Hofmann specifically said the controversy would
<br>join other similar matters as "non-issues in the good state of
<br>Jewish-Catholic relations." Nevertheless, other controversies
<br>continue to rankle with Jews and others. Among them is an old
<br>Latin Catholic Mass prayer calling for conversion of Jews. Even
<br>more controversial in recent months has been the proposal to
<br>canonize (make a saint of) Pope Pius XII, the WWII-era Pope who
<br>some criticize for not having publicly denounced the Holocaust.
<br>Rabbi Cohen of Haifa (Israel), the first Rabbi ever invited to
<br>address a Synod of bishops, implicitly criticized the
<br>canonization proposal in his remarks to the bishops last fall.
<br>Church officials did not expect the criticism and were annoyed
<br>by it. Hofmann dismissed even those public remarks, though,
<br>saying the Rabbi had confided in him that he'd been pressured by
<br>other Jewish leaders to deliver the point.

<br>
<br>Prospects for Pope's Trip to Israel and Jordan
<br>--------------------------------------------- -
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Meanwhile, the Pope's planned visit to Israel looms
<br>large in Vatican-Jewish relations. Consistent with what other
<br>Vatican officials have told us (ref b), Father Hofmann confirmed
<br>that the Pope's trip was not conditioned on resolving Church
<br>property taxation issues in the Israel-Holy See Fundamental
<br>Agreement. The real motivation for the trip is, again,
<br>religious: the eighty-one year-old Pope wants to make a
<br>pilgrimage to the Holy Land as Pontiff before his advanced age
<br>makes it too difficult. At the same time, the Holy See believes
<br>the Pope's trip to Israel, the West Bank and Jordan will advance
<br>awareness about the Holocaust and the need to combat
<br>anti-Semitism. A Papal visit will also publicly highlight the
<br>Vatican's acceptance of the State of Israel, with which the Holy
<br>See established relations in 1993. Hofmann implied that for
<br>these reasons, absent major negative developments, the trip
<br>would occur.
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) In a separate conversation on January 23, the new Israeli
<br>Ambassador to the Holy See, Mordechai Lewy, took a somewhat more
<br>jaded view. While confirming that planning without
<br>pre-conditions is underway, expressing hope that the trip would
<br>happen, and acknowledging that it could advance Catholic-Jewish
<br>dialogue, Lewy would not speculate on its likelihood. Lewy did
<br>not see many prospects for a Papal visit helping to resolve the
<br>Israeli-Palestinian conflict. While Israel wants to keep on
<br>good terms with the Holy See to avoid problems, he said, Israeli
<br>leaders don't think that the Vatican can influence the Arabs.
<br>
<br>¶8. (S) On the other hand, Lewy said, the Jordanians may have a
<br>pecuniary interest in the visit. Prince Ghazi, Lewy alleged,
<br>has financial stakes in the possible tourist development of the
<br>area around Jesus' baptismal site. A Papal visit to this area
<br>would be good for business. Since not all churches in that area
<br>would welcome such development, this has caused some conflict
<br>between authorities and local churches.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) The Israeli Ambassador did not think that the recent Gaza
<br>crisis would play a role in the Pope's final decision on whether
<br>to travel to the Holy Land. Lewy was disappointed with the
<br>Vatican's criticism of Israeli actions in Gaza, and raised his
<br>views with Monsignor Parolin, the Holy See's deputy foreign
<br>minister. Lewy urged Parolin to say something positive about
<br>Israel to balance these remarks. Specifically, he wanted the
<br>Holy See to state publicly that the religious freedom Christians
<br>enjoy in Israel is unparalleled in the Middle East, where
<br>Christian minorities are increasingly on the defensive against
<br>political Islam. Parolin, he said, committed to do so.
<br>
<br>(C) Comment: A Formidable Partner in Need of P.R. Lessons
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------------
<br>
<br>¶10. (S) Pope Benedict sometimes bewilders politicians and
<br>journalists by pursuing what he believes is in the best interest
<br>of the Church, such as reinstating the Lefebvrists or
<br>considering the canonization of Pius XII. (His predecessor,
<br>John Paul II, suffered from some of the same second-guessing.)
<br>Vatican outsiders lament decisions or policies that they
<br>perceive as being out-of-step with the new millennium, and call
<br>for the Church to be more modern and accommodating. What these
<br>observers fail to recognize is the consistency of the Holy See's
<br>decisions and behavior on key issues like the reunification of
<br>the Church or the dignity of all human beings - and the value of
<br>that consistency. Regardless of whether outsiders agree or
<br>disagree with the Holy See, it's hard to dispute its moral
<br>influence, geographic reach, and ability to grab headlines.
<br>These qualities can make the Vatican a formidable partner for
<br>the U.S. and other nations in the pursuit of common objectives.
<br>
<br>¶11. (S) At the same time, there's no denying the fact that a
<br>little more attention to how the outside world views decisions
<br>taken inside the Church could help the Holy See protect its
<br>image and further its influence. Although Church leaders like
<br>Benedict are adopting new means of communication to get their
<br>message to a wider audience (ref C), they have not yet embraced
<br>fully the need -- and tools -- for 21st century public
<br>relations. The Holy See's spokesmen could have resoundingly
<br>denounced the Holocaust-denying views of Bishop Williamson at
<br>the same time the Pope welcomed him back into the Church, but
<br>they waited days to do so, and then did it weakly. By then,
<br>much of the damage had been done. Instead of scoring a
<br>religious hat-trick -- reuniting the Church, demonstrating the
<br>Church's commitment to second chances for those who have erred,
<br>and reaffirming the horrors of the Holocaust -- the Holy See is
<br>playing catch-up. End Comment.
