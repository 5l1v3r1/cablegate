<br>Classified By: Charge d'Affaires, for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Some eight weeks into the Funes 
<br>Administration, we are beginning to see more clearly the 
<br>trends and factions inside the GOES. President Mauricio 
<br>Funes' non-FMLN campaign support group, the Friends of 
<br>Mauricio, is largely in control of the economic apparatus of 
<br>El Salvador. Similarly, Defense is in the hands of a 
<br>formerly-retired, recently-promoted military officer and 
<br>Friend of Mauricio, Brigadier General David Munguia Payes. 
<br>FMLN hard-liners are at the helm of the security and 
<br>intelligence apparatus. Foreign policy is in the hands of a 
<br>loyal FMLN member, but has thus far been characterized by 
<br>pragmatism and outreach to the U.S. Assistance programs 
<br>broadly mirror the rest of the relationship, with most 
<br>programs moving forward successfully but some police and 
<br>security programs under review. The Funes GOES has made 
<br>poverty eradication its highest priority. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>-------- 
<br>The Good 
<br>-------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) The Funes Administration inherited two serious 
<br>economic problems. First, the Salvadoran economy likely 
<br>entered recession in late 2008, driven by falling remittances 
<br>and declining exports because of the U.S. recession. Second, 
<br>the government was effectively broke ) and in many cases 
<br>behind on its bills ) because of declining tax revenues and 
<br>the Saca Administration’s lavish, election-year subsidies. 
<br>So far, the government has chosen to seek new funding from 
<br>the World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, and 
<br>International Monetary Fund, rather than from sources like 
<br>Venezuela. The government's "Anti-Crisis Plan" likewise 
<br>appears to consist primarily of increased funding for 
<br>existing social programs. These programs, however, will 
<br>likely do little to boost the economy, where recovery 
<br>ultimately depends on the recovery in the U.S. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Since June 1, Salvadoran foreign policy has also been 
<br>characterized by pragmatism. Foreign Minister Hugo Martinez 
<br>stepped into the chair at the OAS General Assembly in San 
<br>Pedro Sula just hours after assuming his new role; he 
<br>impressed both the U.S. delegation and Salvadoran observers 
<br>with his performance. Since then, the main foreign policy 
<br>issue faced by the GOES has been Honduras. In the hours 
<br>after President Zelaya's expulsion to Costa Rica, both 
<br>Martinez and Funes reached out to the Embassy and to 
<br>Washington to coordinate what has been a reasonable, 
<br>responsible approach to the crisis on their northern border. 
<br>On Funes' first day in office he recognized Cuba, but 
<br>balanced this by meeting Secretary Clinton and the USDEL to 
<br>his inauguration. FMLN hardliners, particularly Vice 
<br>President Sanchez Ceren, would prefer an ALBA-esque foreign 
<br>policy and carry out a parallel FMLN agenda, but they are not 
<br>permitted to wreck relations with traditional partners. 
<br>Ambassadorial appointments are being made in a deliberate, 
<br>unhurried fashion, and have not raised concerns; indeed, 
<br>keeping former FM Francisco Lainez in place at the OAS sent 
<br>an early signal of continuity. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) On foreign assistance, USAID reports good cooperation 
<br>across the board, save for some difficulties in public 
<br>security. (More on that below.) The GOES has voiced strong 
<br>support for continuing USAID programs and has indicated it is 
<br>in agreement with USAID's strategic goals for El Salvador. 
<br>The Funes Administration has elevated to Vice Minister the 
<br>MFA position responsible for coordinating foreign assistance 
<br>programs and has called for the formulation of a global 
<br>cooperation strategy. The GOES is actively leveraging 
<br>international donors to address its near-term anti-crisis 
<br>plan. In charge of both economic policy and donor 
<br>coordination is Alex Segovia, the President's Chief of 
<br>Cabinet. Segovia, a kind of super-minister, is the most 
<br>pragmatic and least ideological figure in the GOES. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) The GOES just reaffirmed its continued interest in 
<br>USAID's programs for improved tax collection, health sector 
<br>reform and a diagnostic of the education system. MCC's rate 
<br>of implementation continues to gain speed, in large degree 
<br>because of the efforts of local partner FOMILENIO's Director, 
<br>Jose Angel Quiroz. We successfully pushed back against a 
<br>move by Funes to replace Quiroz in the early days of his 
<br>government, arguing that another disruption in FOMILENIO 
<br>management would set back MCC's program by months, if not 
<br>more. It was Segovia, in his role as FOMILENIO Board 
<br>Chairman, who convinced Funes to leave Quiros in place. The 
<br>new GOES has shown great interest in the MCC indicators; 
<br>Segovia just wrote a warm letter to MCC CEO Rodney Bent 
<br>recommitting the GOES to the indicators and all other MCC 
<br>criteria. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Military-to-military cooperation continues at a tempo 
<br>similar to that before Funes took office. The USNS Comfort 
<br>recently spent 11 days anchored offshore and saw more than 
<br>19,000 Salvadoran patients. We have three other Medical 
<br>Readiness Training Exercises scheduled for 2009 and a full 
<br>slate of DOD/SA-funded training for members of the Salvadoran 
<br>Armed Forces (ESAF). Additionally, the MOD has requested USG 
<br>support to conduct a National Security Strategy (NSS) 
<br>workshop with the intent to get Cabinet level and Assembly 
<br>personnel involved in the GOES process to develop their own 
<br>NSS. Appointment of retired Colonel Munguia Payes as 
<br>Minister of Defense, as well as mid-ranked active duty 
<br>colonels to most key command positions, has created 
<br>discomfort in ESAF ranks. However, the Minister of Defense 
<br>is an institutionalist and is focused on maintaining the 
<br>ESAF's apolitical professionalism. The Minister and the ESAF 
<br>are loyal supporters of the president, and eager to continue 
<br>longstanding mil-to-mil relationships with the U.S. 
<br>
<br>------- 
<br>The Bad 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) Salvadorans across the spectrum link Manuel Melgar, 
<br>now Minister of Public Security and Justice, to the 1985 Zona 
<br>Rosa attack which killed four off-duty U.S. Embassy Marine 
<br>Security Guards and other Americans and Salvadorans. 
<br>Melgar's nomination appears to have been based less on his 
<br>public security credentials than on the hard-line FMLN's 
<br>insistence that they control public security. This was their 
<br>"pound of flesh" in exchange for "Friends of Mauricio" 
<br>controlling the economy. Melgar's presence as Minister has 
<br>resulted in a distancing from the USG, a far cry from the 
<br>close relationship we enjoyed with his predecessor. Law 
<br>enforcement cooperation has not been frozen, but full 
<br>implementation of the Merida Initiative is now contingent 
<br>upon guidance from Washington regarding how best to work 
<br>around Melgar. Just as disappointing is the cynical message 
<br>it sends to a high-crime society like El Salvador when the 
<br>President names as Minister of Public Security an individual 
<br>with blood on his hands. 
<br>
<br>------------ 
<br>And the Ugly 
<br>------------ 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Traditional feuds between the Salvadoran right and 
<br>left and modern feuds between Funes and the FMLN are playing 
<br>out in other contexts. Over two weeks after the legal 
<br>deadline (June 30) to appoint five new magistrates to the 
<br>Supreme Court, the Salvadoran Legislative Assembly remained 
<br>deadlocked as the governing FMLN and ARENA-led opposition 
<br>coalition could not reach agreement on a list of names. 
<br>(Note: Supreme Court appointments require a 2/3 
<br>supermajority, thus demanding ARENA and the FMLN support any 
<br>nominee. End note.) Naming a new Attorney General (which 
<br>also requires a 2/3 Assembly vote) became linked to the 
<br>Supreme Court selections and the entire process ground to a 
<br>halt. The Supreme Court was made whole July 16 when a deal 
<br>was struck between Funes, the FMLN, and opposition on a slate 
<br>of nominees. Public and private negotiations continue over 
<br>the new Attorney General. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (S/NF) El Salvador's intelligence service (OIE) in the 
<br>hands of orthodox FMLN member Eduardo Linares could become 
<br>ugly, depending upon how much leeway Funes allows him to 
<br>accept advice, training, money, and personnel from Cuba or 
<br>Venezuela. To date Linares has behaved cautiously, first 
<br>seeking to get his arms around his own organization, which, 
<br>to be fair, had previously considered the FMLN as its primary 
<br>target. 
<br>

<br>Pursuing U.S. Interests Going Forward 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Eight weeks on, we are roughly where we expected to 
<br>be. We have enjoyed excellent cooperation in most areas with 
<br>the GOES, but lost some ground in other areas, especially law 
<br>enforcement. Given the inconsistent performance of 
<br>Salvadoran law enforcement in good times, it has been hard to 
<br>discern a difference in performance, or crime statistics, 
<br>since June 1. Our assistance priorities, and continued trade 
<br>relationship, seems closely aligned with the Funes 
<br>Administration's own goals. Foreign policy priorities will 
<br>sometimes diverge, although our problems are likely to be 
<br>less with the official GOES policies than with the FMLN's own 
<br>parallel policies. The Embassy's approach with the Funes 
<br>Administration will continue to be engagement across the 
<br>board, even with Public Security, up to and including the 
<br>Deputy Minister. Our objective is to strengthen the 
<br>institutions of Salvadoran democracy, regardless of who is in 
<br>power. Civil society, media, and the business sector take a 
<br>parallel and complementary approach. ARENA did not disappear 
<br>June 1 and its reorganization and regrouping is proceeding. 
<br>It promises to remain a significant opposition during the 
<br>entire five years of the Funes Administration.
