<br>
<br>Summary 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) Commander General 
<br>William Ward met Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika 
<br>November 25, during Ward's first visit to Algeria since 
<br>assuming command of AFRICOM. Ward said AFRICOM's strategy 
<br>was to assist African nations in providing for their own 
<br>security needs, not do the job for them. The U.S. recognized 
<br>Algeria's leadership in the region, and AFRICOM was prepared 
<br>to assist Algeria and its neighbors combat terrorism. 
<br>Bouteflika said Algeria wanted to be a strategic partner, not 
<br>an adversary. Our military relationship already included 
<br>training and technical cooperation. End-use-monitoring 
<br>requirements infringed on Algeria's national sovereignty and 
<br>therefore imposed some limits on military engagement. But 
<br>the U.S. and Algeria shared a common goal in combating 
<br>terrorism. Terrorism in the region had taken a dangerous 
<br>form, and Sahel countries were prepared to address the 
<br>problem jointly. More needed to be done to ensure the 
<br>participation and commitment of Mali's political leadership 
<br>in the regional struggle. Bouteflika told Ward the Malian 
<br>president needed to understand he could not be friends with 
<br>both the thieves and their victims at the same time. 
<br>Trans-Sahara heads of state still planned to convene a 
<br>security and development summit in Bamako but had yet to set 
<br>a firm date. Bouteflika also reviewed Egyptian-Algerian 
<br>tensions in the aftermath of a World Cup qualifying match, 
<br>Western Sahara, the negative repercussions of Israeli 
<br>settlement activities, Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan. On the 
<br>soccer issue, he made a point of telling Ward that the king 
<br>of Morocco -- in contrast to the strain with Egypt -- had 
<br>sent him a very warm congratulatory message after the game. 
<br>At the end of the meeting, Bouteflika invited Ward to return 
<br>to Algeria in the near future. End summary. 
<br>
<br>Addressing Common Challenges 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Visiting Africa Command (AFRICOM) Commander General 
<br>William Ward met with Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika 
<br>November 25 at the presidential residence. With Bouteflika 
<br>were Chief of Staff of the Algerian National Popular Army 
<br>(ANP) Lieutenant General Ahmed Gaid-Salah, Ministry of 
<br>National Defense (MND) Director of External Relations and 
<br>Cooperation General Nourredine Mekri, ANP Chief of 
<br>Organization and Logistics Major General Abdelhamid Ghriss 
<br>and a translator. The Ambassador, General Ward's foreign 
<br>policy advisor, Dr. Raymond Brown, the DATT and Poloff 
<br>(notetaker) accompanied General Ward to the meeting, which 
<br>lasted two hours. Ward emphasized that his visit to Algiers 
<br>was symbolic of our countries' growing bilateral 
<br>relationship. Africa Command's mission was to assist African 
<br>nations address their own security challenges, not to do it 
<br>for them. The purpose of his visit, Ward said, was to listen 
<br>to Algeria's perspective on enhancing our cooperation as we 
<br>seek ways to work together to address common challenges in 
<br>Africa. Ward recognized that these challenges were complex 
<br>and required development and political solutions, not just 
<br>military intervention. Going forward, we sought to cooperate 
<br>in areas that Algeria determines are priorities. AFRICOM 
<br>welcomed the regional counterterrorism efforts Algeria has 
<br>engaged in with neighboring Sahel countries. Algeria is 
<br>leading the effort; we will work with Algeria and its 
<br>neighbors to assist in eliminating the terrorist threat in 
<br>the region. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) President Bouteflika said that the United States and 
<br>Algeria shared a common objective and the will to work 
<br>cooperatively in the fight against terrorism. Bouteflika 
<br>noted the U.S. and Algeria started to work more closely 
<br>together during the Clinton administration when both sides 
<br>came to realize they were fighting the same problem. 
<br>Bouteflika underscored that after 9/11, Algeria was the first 
<br>Arab and Muslim country to send a message of solidarity to 
<br>President Bush. Subsequently, despite the unpopularity of 
<br>some Bush policies, political and economic relations between 
<br>our countries improved. Today, relations were excellent, he 
<br>said, noting that Algeria was the United States' second 
<br>largest trading partner in the Middle East after Saudi Arabia 
<br>and our largest trading partner in Africa. President Obama's 
<br>new approach to U.S. foreign policy was "a breath of fresh 
<br>air" and well regarded by developing world countries. But 
<br>this meant there were also high expectations for his 
<br>administration. Bouteflika predicted that our bilateral 
<br>relationship would continue in a positive direction. He 
<br>commented that the U.S. and Algeria were moving forward with 
<br>cooperation, recognizing the value of dialogue across all 
<br>leadership levels. In this regard, Bouteflika declared he 
<br>was ready to assist Ward and invited him to visit Algeria 
<br>again. 
<br>
<br>Military Cooperation 
<br>-------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) Bouteflika attached importance to Algeria's 
<br>military-military cooperation with the United States but 
<br>noted that U.S. end-use monitoring requirements contravened 
<br>Algeria's national sovereignty. Nonetheless, we had made 
<br>progress on training and technical cooperation. Bouteflika 
<br>said the capabilities of U.S. and Algerian forces were well 
<br>understood in the region. Bouteflika argued that frank, 
<br>direct talks were the key to a successful military dialogue, 
<br>as well as recognizing that, in some cases, there would be 
<br>limits on the extent of cooperation. "Tell us what you want, 
<br>and we will tell you what we can do." Algeria, he continued, 
<br>wanted to be a strategic partner for the U.S. in the region, 
<br>not an adversary. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) General Ward thanked Bouteflika for his candid 
<br>assessment of our mil-mil relationship. He said the 
<br>President, secretaries of State and Defense, and US Joint 
<br>Chiefs of Staff, all recognized the value of the US-Algeria 
<br>partnership. Bouteflika responded that he would help us to 
<br>consolidate that partnership. Ward argued that to enhance 
<br>our partnership, Algeria needed to tell us how we can 
<br>contribute best to achieve mutual objectives. Despite the 
<br>bad things sometimes said about AFRICOM, Ward said with a 
<br>smile, his command had not been created to take over Africa. 
<br>Without missing a beat, Bouteflika replied with an even 
<br>bigger smile that he had been unsure about this himself until 
<br>Ward came. Ward said that, as we continue our military 
<br>dialogue, we want to do the things Algeria tells us are 
<br>important. Ward affirmed Algeria had long recognized the 
<br>challenge of extremism and demonstrated its ability to fight 
<br>back. AFRICOM would do its part to support Algeria and its 
<br>neighbors in this effort. Addressing Bouteflika's point on 
<br>end-use-monitoring requirements, Ward suggested focusing our 
<br>efforts in areas where cooperation was possible, i.e., 
<br>training and equipping. He acknowledged that some U.S. laws 
<br>and regulations may preclude for now Algeria's participation 
<br>in other forms of engagement. 
<br>
<br>Civil-Military Relations 
<br>------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S) Bouteflika underscored that Algeria's military 
<br>"absolutely" respected the authority of civilian leadership. 
<br>"This is not at all like Turkey," he said. Bouteflika 
<br>asserted that the army was forced to take drastic measures 
<br>during the violence of the 1990s in order to save the 
<br>country. This was a difficult period, but constitutional 
<br>rule had been restored. "The house is now in order," he 
<br>stressed, "and I can tell you that the army obeys the 
<br>civilians. There is one constitution and all obey it." 
<br>Bouteflika acknowledged, however, that the problems of the 
<br>past still haunted the country. He cited foreign press 
<br>reports referring to Algeria as a dictatorship and argued 
<br>that the term was sometimes used carelessly. The Algerian 
<br>constitution had established the rule of law. In 2004 it was 
<br>decided that there was no more historical "revolutionary 
<br>legitimacy". The only legitimacy was the constitution. 
<br>"Anyone can be a candidate for election, in accordance with 
<br>the constitution, even a general." He paused, then grinned 
<br>and said, "but the generals realize the difficulties and none 
<br>has been a candidate yet." 
<br>
<br>Counterterrorism 
<br>---------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Bouteflika said terrorism in Africa had taken a 
<br>dangerous form. The situation in Somalia was hopeless, he 
<br>commented. Meanwhile, the Sahel region presented a complex 
<br>set of issues. Fortunately, most Sahel countries were 
<br>determined to cooperate and have the capability to fight the 
<br>threat if they work together. Mauritania expressed a clear 
<br>commitment as did Niger, although Bouteflika recognized U.S. 
<br>concerns with President Tandja. Mali's full cooperation 
<br>remained elusive, however. Mali's policies have failed to 
<br>create stability in the north. The result is a lawless 
<br>environment in which smuggling, along with arms and drug 
<br>trafficking, enable terrorism. Bouteflika said the region 
<br>was prepared to tackle this problem, and bilateral and 
<br>regional efforts were already underway. In this regard, 
<br>Algeria was closely monitoring U.S. military assistance to 
<br>Mali and Niger. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (S) Ward told Bouteflika that he planned to visit Bamako 
<br>after Algiers and would encourage Mali's leaders to cooperate 
<br>in the region's counterterrorism efforts. The U.S. was 
<br>providing military assistance to Mali, and we hoped it 
<br>complemented the work Algeria was doing. Ward emphasized 
<br>that, ultimately, defeating terrorism was the responsibility 
<br>of the region. Bouteflika expressed his appreciation for 
<br>U.S. assistance to Mali and said Algeria also provided aid, 
<br>including some equipment. Bouteflika urged the U.S. to tell 
<br>Malian President Amadou Toumani Toure that "he cannot be a 
<br>friend to the thieves and victims at the same time." Many in 
<br>Mali's security services shared the same concern, Bouteflika 
<br>asserted. In the past, he said, Algeria has waited for the 
<br>chance to debrief terrorist suspects held in Mali, only to 
<br>find out later that Malian officials were conducting 
<br>negotiations for the terrorist's release back to the 
<br>terrorist organizations at the same time. "It is difficult 
<br>to cooperate in these conditions," he said. Despite 
<br>difficulties, Bouteflika said regional leaders still planned 
<br>to convene a security and development summit in Bamako. All 
<br>agreed on the need for the summit, he said, but there was 
<br>still no set date. Bouteflika said that Algeria would be 
<br>open to sharing information with the U.S. regarding Algeria's 
<br>cooperation with its neighbors. General Ward said AFRICOM 
<br>would do the same for Algeria regarding U.S. initiatives in 
<br>the region. 
<br>
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>
<br>¶16. (S) The Ward-Bouteflika meeting was significant in a 
<br>number of respects. The Algerian president spoke repeatedly 
<br>of his readiness to build a strategic relationship with the 
<br>US. He transmitted clear readiness for closer coordination 
<br>and contact on Sahel counter-terrorism issues. The simple 
<br>fact of the meeting with the president was itself a green 
<br>light to the military bureaucracy on stepped-up bilateral 
<br>military cooperation. Not least, the warm and high-level 
<br>official reception provided a powerful antidote to the 
<br>persistent negative mythology about Africa Command since the 
<br>command's rollout. It was also noteworthy that, in the 
<br>presence of three generals, including the chief of staff, 
<br>Bouteflika spoke assertively to Ward about civilian control 
<br>of the military. He described the revolutionary origins of 
<br>military influence in Algeria, said this so-called 
<br>revolutionary legitimacy ended in 2004, and the military now 
<br>obeys the civilians and they all obey the constitution. In 
<br>the course of his regional political review, Bouteflika 
<br>delivered Algeria's views on Western Sahara in familiar 
<br>terms. But in doing so, he also struck an unusually 
<br>positive note about Morocco and the king's message. Clearly, 
<br>in the context of the high emotions stirred in Algeria over 
<br>the controversial World Cup contest with Egypt, Mohammed VI's 
<br>message of congratulations struck a chord with Bouteflika.
