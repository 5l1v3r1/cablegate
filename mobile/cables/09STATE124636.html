<br>Classified By: ELISSA G. PITTERLE, DIRECTOR, INR/OPS. REASON: 1.4(C). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C/NF) WASHINGTON ANALYSTS HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY 
<br>INTERESTED IN MEXICO'S LEADERSHIP DYNAMICS, AND WE HAVE 
<br>APPRECIATED POST'S COVERAGE OF THIS TOPIC, REFS A-E HAVE 
<br>SPECIFICALLY BEEN USEFUL TO GAUGE INSIGHT INTO THESE 
<br>DYNAMICS. WE ARE INTERESTED IN REVISITING OUR ASSESSMENT OF 
<br>MEXICAN PRESIDENT CALDERON TO BETTER INFORM US POLICYMAKERS 
<br>ON HIS LEADERSHIP STYLE. REFS F-H HAVE INDICATED THAT 
<br>CALDERON AND HIS ADMINISTRATION ARE CURRENTLY UNDER GREAT 
<br>STRESS FROM THE DRUG WAR, ECONOMIC COLLAPSE, AND HIS PARTY'S 
<br>MIDTERM ELECTION LOSSES. DESPITE RECENT REPORTING WE ARE 
<br>STILL INTERESTED IN HOW THESE CURRENT STRESSES ARE AFFECTING 
<br>HIS PERSONALITY AND MANAGEMENT STYLE AND HOW THAT STYLE IS 
<br>AFFECTING THE RUNNING OF THE GOVERNMENT ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT 
<br>OF RECENT CABINET CHANGES. IN THE COURSE OF POST'S REGULAR 
<br>MEETINGS, WE WOULD WELCOME ANY INSIGHT POST CAN PROVIDE ON 
<br>THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS. 
<br>
<br>¶A. (U) PRESIDENT CALDERON 
<br>
<br>1) (C/NF) HOW DOES PRESIDENT CALDERON REACT TO VIEWPOINTS 
<br>THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM HIS OWN? (DOES HE LIKE TO GET INTO 
<br>DEBATES WITH PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE WITH HIM? DOES HE PREFER TO 
<br>LISTEN TO THEIR VIEWPOINT, THINK ON IT FOR A WHILE, AND COME 
<br>BACK WITH A RESPONSE?) DOES HE SURROUND HIMSELF WITH PEOPLE 
<br>WHO HAVE A VARIETY OF VIEWPOINTS, OR DOES HE PREFER "YES MEN"? 
<br>
<br>2) (C/NF) HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE CALDERON'S MANAGEMENT 
<br>STYLE (MORE OF AN "IDEA MAN" OR MORE OF A "MICROMANAGER")? 
<br>WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF HIS MANAGEMENT STYLE ON THOSE WHO 
<br>WORK FOR HIM? 
<br>
<br>3) (C/NF) HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE CALDERON'S PERSONALITY? 
<br>WHAT VALUES/BELIEFS/BEHAVIORS DOES CALDERON HOLD MOST DEARLY, 
<br>AND RESPECT MOST IN OTHERS (TRUTHFULNESS, LOYALTY, RESPECT, 
<br>ETC)? 
<br>
<br>4) (C/NF) WHAT ARE CALDERON'S PLANS' FOR THE REMAINDER OF 
<br>HIS TERM? (SECURITY, ECONOMY, PAN PARTY, DEALING WITH THE 
<br>PRI)? 
<br>
<br>¶B. (U) CABINET 
<br>
<br>1) (C/NF) WHAT ARE THE GOALS FOR PRESIDENT CALDERON'S 
<br>SECURITY AND ECONOMIC SECTIONS OF HIS CABINET DURING THEIR 
<br>REMAINING TIME IN OFFICE? HOW DO THEY PLAN ON ACHIEVING THOSE 
<br>GOALS? 
<br>
<br>2) (C/NF) HOW DO THEY INDIVIDUALLY VIEW THE UNITED STATES, 
<br>AND HOW STRONG IS THEIR WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH US 
<br>OFFICIALS? 
<br>
<br>3) (C/NF) WHAT IS THE CURRENT RELATIONSHIP STATUS OF 
<br>PRESIDENT CALDERON'S CABINET? DO ALL MEMBERS GET ALONG? HAVE 
<br>RIVALRIES, FRIENDSHIPS BEEN FORMED? HAVE THESE RELATIONSHIPS 
<br>TRICKLED DOWN TO THE WORKING LEVEL STAFFS OF EACH CABINET 
<br>MEMBER,S OFFICE? 
<br>
<br>4) (C/NF) HAS JOB STRESS AFFECTED ANY OF THE SECURITY AND 
<br>ECONOMIC SECTIONS OF HIS CABINET MEMBERS, HEALTH? IF SO, 
<br>HOW? WHAT ARE SOME WAYS THESE MEMBERS ARE ADDRESSING THIS 
<br>STRESS? 
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) PLEASE CITE C-AL9-02352 IN THE SUBJECT LINE OF 
<br>REPORTING IN RESPONSE TO THE ABOVE QUESTIONS.
