<br>SUBJECT: PORTUGUESE FM OFFERS TO RESIGN IF CIA FLIGHT 
<br>ALLEGATIONS PROVE TRUE 
<br>
<br>REF: A. 2005 LISBON 1609 
<br>¶B. LISBON 1921 
<br>¶C. OCTOBER 12 DVC (WITH DOS DOD AND EMBASSY LISBON) 
<br>
<br>Classified By: POL CHIEF TROY FITRELL, REASONS 1.4 (B,D) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) Summary: Portugal's Foreign Minister offered to 
<br>resign if opposition forces can demonstrate any complicity on 
<br>the part of the government regarding alleged illegal CIA 
<br>rendition flights through Portuguese territory. While a 
<br>government investigation has refuted these allegations, the 
<br>saga continues due to continued opposition party and European 
<br>Parliament pressure. This pressure complicates the US 
<br>request to repatriate Guantanamo detainees via Portugal. End 
<br>summary. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) Ongoing pressure from Portugal's Left Bloc and from 
<br>the European Parliament led to a testy exchange in Portugal's 
<br>Parliament on October 18, in which Foreign Minister Luis 
<br>Amado offered to resign if the opposition could prove 
<br>Government of Portugal (GOP) complicity with the USG 
<br>regarding alleged illegal CIA flights violating Portuguese 
<br>sovereignty. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (U) Amado's most recent testimony reflected that of his 
<br>predecessor, Diogo Freitas do Amaral in December 2005 (Ref A) 
<br>and his own earlier testimony on September 5 this year, 
<br>noting the GOP had completed an investigation that discovered 
<br>no information to support allegations that CIA flights 
<br>violated Portugal's territory or airspace to transport 
<br>terrorism suspects. Amado told the Parliamentary Committee 
<br>that "None of the explanations or data collected... 
<br>constitutes a credible indication that the law may have been 
<br>broken on Portuguese soil." He went on to tell reporters 
<br>that a joint investigation by four government departments, 
<br>also involving the country's intelligence agencies, 
<br>immigration service and flight control authorities, conducted 
<br>a review of plane movements but found no firm evidence." 
<br>Amado admitted that the alleged CIA flights might have come 
<br>through Portugal, but added that Portugal "has nothing to be 
<br>ashamed of." According to the Minister, there is no evidence 
<br>that the CIA committed illegal acts in Portuguese territory 
<br>and even stated that he has had nothing but "total 
<br>transparency and cooperation" from American authorities. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (U) Freitas do Amaral had offered the government 
<br>investigation as a way to address the allegations. The 
<br>results, however, have not silenced the GOP's critics, 
<br>especially in the Left Bloc or the European Parliament. 
<br>Portugal's Parliament has established an ad hoc committee 
<br>to continue hearings on the subject and a delegation from the 
<br>European Parliament is scheduled to visit Portugal in 
<br>December to interview Amado, who has declined to visit 
<br>Brussels to meet with Euro Deputies. 
<br>
<br>Effect on Repatriation Request 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br>¶5. (S/NF) Amado's testimony reflects the continued political 
<br>and media pressure on the GOP regarding this subject and 
<br>makes the GOP's efforts to assist in repatriation of 
<br>Guantanamo detainees all the more difficult. It is critical 
<br>that Washington readers recognize the GOP's need to ensure 
<br>that it is on solid legal ground regarding our request on 
<br>detainees. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) Portuguese law, as interpreted by the GOP (which 
<br>could change), requires written assurance by the final 
<br>destination country that detainees will not be tortured or 
<br>receive the death penalty as well as a US guarantee that they 
<br>will be treated according to internationally-recognized 
<br>conventions in the destination country. Without these 
<br>assurances, the GOP will have difficulty n supporting 
<br>repatriation flights through Portuguese territory or 
<br>airspace. We eagerly await Washington addressees response to 
<br>the Portuguese points as discussed Ref C. The GOP will 
<br>undoubtedly expect this issue to be discussed at the October 
<br>24 meeting between Amado and Secretary Rice in Washington. 
<br>
<br>The Media 
<br>--------- 
<br>¶7. (U) The local press eagerly reprints hearsay on this 
<br>tantalizing subject as left wing politicians unveil "new 
<br>facts" every few days to fan the political fires. Post 
<br>believes the media will continue to sensationalize the issue 
<br>as long as it has legs. 
<br>
<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br>¶8. (S/NF) The normally unflappable Amado lost his cool during 
<br>the testimony; an event that is completely out of character 
<br>and shows the effects of unrelenting media and political 
<br>attacks. Despite this outburst, we believe Amado will 
<br>
<br>continue to reiterate what the investigation has revealed - 
<br>the government has no evidence of illegal CIA flights 
<br>on/through Portuguese territory. However, Post underscores 
<br>the delicate balancing act Amado is confronting in minimizing 
<br>damage to his government - however unwarranted - due to the 
<br>CIA Rendition investigation while trying to convince it to 
<br>grant our request to repatriate Guantanamo detainees through 
<br>Lajes. Right now, it would be to our advantage to stroke him 
<br>a lot.
