<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) Summary: xxxxx based in Tehran, in
<br>separate conversations with IRPO officers, said that officials
<br>in Iran's Ministry of Interior are willing to work with the
<br>United States on issues relating to Afghanistan within a United
<br>Nations framework. Specifically, they noted that the IRIG is
<br>seeking cooperation and assistance to address the problems of
<br>refugees/economic migrants from Afghanistan and combating the
<br>flow of narcotics from Afghanistan. Both men pointed to xxxxx as the likely IRIG lead on any
<br>such initiative. End summary.
<br>
<br>Refugees and Counter Narcotics: Potential Areas for Technical
<br>Cooperation
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) During a November xxxxx
<br>described counter-narcotics and refugees as areas ripe for
<br>cooperation between Iran and the United States. xxxxx
<br>there is strong support within the Ministry of Interior for a
<br>joint and pragmatic approach to address problems emanating from
<br>Afghanistan. xxxxx argued that elements within the IRIG,
<br>particularly at the sub-ministerial and working levels, would be
<br>comfortable working with the USG under the UN umbrella. In a
<br>separate conversation, xxxxx said that Iranian officials have repeatedly
<br>expressed interest to UNODC staff in Iran about working
<br>multilaterally, including with the US and the UK, to combat the
<br>production of drugs in Afghanistan as well as drug trafficking
<br>to/through Iran.
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) xxxxx said that any contribution on the part of the
<br>United States toward easing the societal and economic burdens
<br>the instability in Afghanistan places on Iran would be well
<br>received by both the people and the government of Iran.
<br>Iranians, in his estimation, feel that their assistance to
<br>Afghan refugees over the decades of war in that country has been
<br>unappreciated by the international community in general and the
<br>US in particular. xxxxx also argued that explicit and
<br>tangible contributions to refugee assistance, above and beyond
<br>our contributions to UNHCR, would help undermine IRIG officials'
<br>attempts to portray USG actions in the region as inhumane.
<br>xxxxx cited increasing negative domestic press coverage of the
<br>effects on Iran caused by the "reverse flow" of economic
<br>migrants from Afghanistan to Iran. At the same time, xxxxx
<br>cautioned against the USG publicly trying to take credit for its
<br>assistance, as publicity could backfire by causing MOI officials
<br>to back away.
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) Both xxxxx as a potential interlocutor for both counter-narcotics
<br>and refugee issues. xxxxx is xxxxx able to "get many things
<br>done." xxxxx is known as a pragmatist rather
<br>than an ideologue and has a solid working relationship with the
<br>xxxxx in Iran.
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) xxxxx believes that just within the past couple of
<br>months, members of Tehran's political elite who favor
<br>cooperation with the West on Afghanistan have become noticeably
<br>emboldened. xxxxx. While acknowledging that
<br>invitation-only discussions held in think tanks and research
<br>centers affiliated with state institutions hardly signals a sea
<br>change in official thinking, xxxxx argued forcefully that just
<br>a few months ago such events would have been unthinkable.
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) In a separate discussion with xxxxx in early November, IRPO first heard that the Iranian
<br>
<br>Dubai 00000056 002.2 of 002
<br>
<br>
<br>government - in this case xxxxx
<br>- was keenly interested in counternarcotics cooperation with the
<br>US. Following up above via two separate UN agency officials
<br>based in Iran, we are now confident that this interest is
<br>genuine, although we can not ascribe IRIG motivations.
