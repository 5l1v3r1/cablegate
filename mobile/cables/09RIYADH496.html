<br>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR SENATOR BOND'S APRIL 6-8 VISIT TO
<br>SAUDI ARABIA
<br>
<br>Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission David Rundell for reasons 1.4 (b)
<br>and (d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (U) The Embassy welcomes your visit to the Kingdom of
<br>Saudi Arabia.  This message provides a brief overview of key
<br>current issues in U.S. - Saudi relations, tailored to the
<br>particular issues that your Saudi interlocutors will likely
<br>raise with you.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) You will be arriving six days after an Arab League
<br>Summit in Doha.  Despite the Saudis pulling out all the
<br>diplomatic stops to ensure the summit conveyed publicly a
<br>sufficient degree of Arab unity, Libyan leader Muammar
<br>Qadhafi's eccentric outburst showed that deep fissures still
<br>exist.  This was the second such embarrassment in the past
<br>three months showing the Arabs to be badly divided on
<br>regional security issues after public disagreements at the
<br>Arab Economic Summit in Kuwait in January.
<br>
<br>U.S. Saudi Relations on the Mend
<br>---------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) As you will hear, Saudi foreign policy calculations
<br>are driven by a deep fear and suspicion of expanding Iranian
<br>influence.  While U.S.-Saudi relations have improved
<br>dramatically since their post-9/11 nadir, differences remain
<br>over U.S. Middle East policies. The Saudis have three
<br>principal issues areas of concern about U.S. policies:
<br>
<br>--(C) As the author of the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, King
<br>Abdallah risked his personal prestige to advocate a
<br>comprehensive Middle East peace as the "strategic option" for
<br>the Arabs, only to be frustrated by what he saw as U.S.
<br>reluctance to engage over the next seven years.
<br>
<br>--(C) Similarly, in the Saudi view, we ignored advice from
<br>the King and Foreign Minister against invading Iraq. In the
<br>words of Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal,
<br>"military intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan has tilted the
<br>(regional) balance of power towards Iran."
<br>
<br>--(C) Finally, the U.S. debate over whether and how to engage
<br>Iran has fueled Saudi fears that a new U.S. administration
<br>might strike a "grand bargain" without first consultating
<br>Arab countries bordering the Persian Gulf.
<br>
<br>Appointment of Prince Nayif
<br>---------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Saudi King Abdallah issued a royal decree appointing
<br>his half-brother, Interior Minister Prince Nayif bin
<br>Abdalaziz, as second deputy prime minister March 27.  The
<br>position had been vacant since Abdallah became King in 2005.
<br>Though the previous two crown princes held Nayif's new
<br>position prior to being formally tapped as heirs to the
<br>throne, this appointment does not necessarily mean Nayif is
<br>"Crown Prince in Waiting," because King Abdallah created a
<br>committee -- the Allegiance Council -- to select the King's
<br>successor.
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) The King was likely driven by expediency.  Crown
<br>Prince Sultan is for all intents and purposes incapacitated,
<br>and the King needed to travel abroad.  Someone had to be left
<br>in charge and Nayif, by virtue of his seniority among the
<br>sons of Abdalaziz and his position as Minister of Interior,
<br>was by tradition the leading candidate for the job.
<br>Assistant Interior Minister Mohammed bin Nayif (MBN) told the
<br>Ambassador that his father's appointment should not be seen
<br>in the light of succession, but as "an administrative
<br>necessity."
<br>
<br>Internal security
<br>------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (C/NF) With our assistance, Saudi Arabia has largely
<br>defeated terrorism at home.  The Saudis are now arguably our
<br>most important counterterrorist intelligence partner.  They
<br>established tighter controls on charities and the
<br>transporting of cash to disrupt terrorist finance.  We have
<br>signed an Information Sharing Agreement with the Kingdom and
<br>started to exchange Airline Passenger Information and
<br>Passenger Name Record (API/PNR) data to help track terrorist
<br>suspects and facilitate legitimate travel.  We can say
<br>clearly that Saudi Arabia is now part of the solution, not
<br>the problem.
<br>
<br>¶7. (S/NF) The Saudi leadership remains greatly concerned
<br>about the vulnerability of its energy production facilities,
<br>and has put MBN of the Ministry of Interior (MOI) in charge
<br>of efforts to acquire the capability to defend this key
<br>infrastructure.  He is looking primarily to the U.S. to build
<br>this capability through an initiative formalized in May 2008
<br>when Secretary Rice and Prince Nayif signed a TCA creating
<br>the Joint Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection.
<br>We have established an inter-agency, DOS/DOD/DOE, security
<br>advisory organization, the Office of Program
<br>Management-Ministry of Interior (OPM-MOI), to implement this
<br>bilateral security agreement.  King Abdullah has made the
<br>protection of Saudi Arabia's critical infrastructure a top
<br>security priority, with MBN fully empowered to achieve this
<br>objective.
<br>
<br>Rehabilitation Program
<br>----------------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (S/NF) We estimate that at least 1,500 former extremists
<br>have passed through the Interior Ministry's rehabilitation
<br>program for extremists (1,200 through the prison rehab
<br>program and 300 through the care center), including 119
<br>Guantanamo returnees, with an overall recidivism rate of 8-10
<br>percent.  Despite the front page treatment of former
<br>Guantanamo detainee Sa'eed al-Shihri's appearance in Yemen,
<br>the real story of the Saudi rehabilitation program is one of
<br>success:  at least 90 percent of its graduates appear to have
<br>given up jihad and reintegrated into Saudi society.  The
<br>recidivists are the exception, not the rule.  The Ministry
<br>takes a dynamic approach to the rehab program and will look
<br>for ways to strengthen it by learning from these incidents of
<br>recidivism.
<br>
<br>¶9. (S/NF) We know less about recidivism among non-Guantanamo
<br>detainees since they were arrested here for activities inside
<br>Saudi Arabia and as such their cases are an internal Saudi
<br>matter.  However we believe a small minority of these have
<br>re-engaged in violent extremist activity, and MOI tells us
<br>former Guantanamo detainees were harder to rehabilitate than
<br>this other category.
<br>
<br>The Peace Process after Gaza
<br>----------------------------
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) King Abdullah stated the Saudi position bluntly in
<br>the opening session of the January Summit in Kuwait:  Israel
<br>should realize that the choice between peace and war will not
<br>be available indefinitely, and the Saudi-authored Arab Peace
<br>Initiative, currently on the table, will not remain there
<br>forever.  However, the Saudis have made no move to withdraw
<br>the plan yet.  Saudi and Arab public opinion have reacted
<br>strongly to the Israeli offensive on Gaza, creating intense
<br>pressure on Arab governments to act.  The Saudis fear
<br>instability and increasing Iranian influence could result,
<br>and believe that there is a limited window of opportunity for
<br>action.
<br>
<br>Iran
<br>-----
<br>
<br>¶11. (S) Iran remains the strategic threat at the forefront of
<br>Saudi security concerns. Senior U.S. officials visiting the
<br>Kingdom recently have heard the King expound at length about
<br>the great danger that Iran poses to the region.  In general,
<br>the Saudi leadership has begun to look at all regional
<br>security issues through the prism of their fears about
<br>growing Iranian influence.  They see Iran's activities as
<br>dangerously provocative, not only in Iraq, but also in
<br>Lebanon, Bahrain, Yemen, parts of Africa, and southeast Asia.
<br>King Abdullah met with Iranian Foreign Minister Mottaki
<br>earlier this month, and subsequently informed the NSC's John
<br>Brennan that he had had a "heated exchange" with Mottaki,
<br>upbraiding him that "Persians" have no business meddling in
<br>"Arab" affairs and threatening that he would give Iran no
<br>more than a year to repair its relations in the region.
<br>Saudi intelligence chief Prince Muqrin told Brennan the
<br>"Shi'a crescent has become a full moon," implying that the
<br>Saudis are surrounded by Iranian intrigues.
<br>
<br>¶12. (S) On Iranian nuclear activities, the Saudi view is that
<br>nations have the right to a peaceful nuclear program, but
<br>that Iran does not have the right to do what it is doing.
<br>The Saudis want to see a peaceful solution to the Iran
<br>nuclear problem but they also want reassurance that Saudi
<br>interests will be factored into any deal struck with Iran.
<br>
<br>Afghanistan
<br>------------
<br>
<br>¶13. (S/NF) We have been encouraging the Saudi government to
<br>be more active in support of the Karzai government, in
<br>particular by helping to train, or to fund the training of,
<br>Afghan security forces.  Saudi Arabia has been helpful in
<br>providing assistance, but we would like them to do more.  One
<br>area in which Saudi diplomacy has been forward leaning is in
<br>offering to help mediate between the Afghan government and
<br>the Taliban.
<br>
<br>Pakistan
<br>---------
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) The Saudis are extremely concerned about Pakistan's
<br>political fragility, and have worked hard, through their
<br>embassy in Islamabad, to bring the Pakistani factions
<br>together.  Saudi relations with Pakistan have been strained
<br>because the Saudis don't trust Zardari and see him and other
<br>leading Pakistani politicians as corrupt.  Zardari visited
<br>Saudi Arabia last November for talks with King Abdullah on
<br>Saudi support for the "Friends of Pakistan" initiative and
<br>oil subsidies.  The visit was an opportunity for Zardari to
<br>persuade skeptical Saudis that he can be a trustworthy
<br>partner in managing one of Saudi Arabia's most important
<br>regional relationships, but his trip appears not to have
<br>resulted in new Saudi assistance or other commitments.  The
<br>Saudis say they have been holding back economic and political
<br>support pending evidence that the political situation in
<br>Pakistan is stabilizing.
