<br>Summary
<br>
<br>-------
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) Colombian High Commissioner for Peace Frank Pearl told
<br>the Ambassador January 5 that his office is preparing "roadmaps"
<br>for the next Administration on how best to pursue peace agreements
<br>with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and National
<br>Liberation Army (ELN). Pearl acknowledged that the GOC had
<br>communicated with both groups in order to develop the road maps and
<br>build confidence. Both groups have expressed minimum conditions
<br>for a peace process that is supported by the GOC, the military, the
<br>private sector, and the international community. In the short
<br>term, Pearl plans to focus on the humanitarian release of FARC
<br>hostages and a secret meeting between the GOC and ELN with an aim
<br>to revitalizing the stalled peace talks. Wild cards include
<br>President Uribe's possible reelection, support from Venezuelan
<br>President Chavez, and the FARC's acquisition of "game-changing"
<br>weaponry such as man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS). End
<br>summary.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Roadmaps for Peace
<br>
<br>------------------
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) At a breakfast hosted by the Ambassador on January 5,
<br>Peace Commissioner Frank Pearl disclosed that when he took office
<br>in February last year, he assessed that there was not enough time
<br>left in the Uribe Administration (which ends August 7, 2010) for
<br>either the FARC or ELN to conclude a peace agreement with the GOC.
<br>He said his office had instead been focused on developing
<br>communication channels and building confidence with both terrorist
<br>organizations. Responses from these contacts, he continued, had
<br>informed the development of "roadmaps" that define both a desired
<br>end-state and the process to get there. The International
<br>Organization for Migration (IOM), supported by USAID, was drafting
<br>many of the documents. Pearl planned to present these fleshed out
<br>plans to the president-elect (or to President Uribe if he is
<br>reelected) in June to help guide the next Administration.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) From the FARC, Pearl had seen little interest in
<br>initiating peace talks. FARC Supreme Leader Alfonso Cano was still
<br>consolidating his authority and proving his mettle as a military
<br>commander. It would have been impossible for Cano, he surmised, to
<br>have broached peace talks so soon after taking the reins of the
<br>FARC in May 2008. Still, Pearl noted that the deaths of three
<br>Secretariat members in 2008 had resulted in replacements that were
<br>more educated, intellectual, and aware of the international context
<br>of the conflict. This, coupled with an analysis of recent FARC
<br>communiques, suggested that the organization was open to a
<br>political solution to the conflict. He said other sources had
<br>signaled that the FARC's preferred end-state is the transition to a
<br>series of social networks (presumably comprised of demobilized
<br>fronts) that interface with a political party. Pearl admitted that
<br>such a solution was years away, but that having a notion of the
<br>other side's goals and objectives at the outset was important.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) In the short term, Pearl said the GOC would continue to
<br>pursue the humanitarian release of two military hostages and the
<br>remains of a third held by the FARC. He said FARC interlocutor
<br>Piedad Cordoba told him December 24 that release was imminent but
<br>
<br>on December 29 reported that the FARC had rejected a facilitation
<br>role by Brazil and had counter-offered with Argentina or Sweden.
<br>The Ambassador counseled that the GOC cultivate the International
<br>Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Catholic Church as
<br>interlocutors for the humanitarian release rather than depend
<br>solely on the Chavez-linked Senator Cordoba.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) Pearl contrasted the FARC's situation with that of the
<br>ELN, which had developed a comprehensive basic framework agreement
<br>during talks that stalled in early 2008. He said the ELN's Central
<br>Command (COCE) had indicated interest in reviving those talks under
<br>appropriate conditions (ref). Pearl commented that the ELN process
<br>had been facilitated initially by Cuban government officials expert
<br>in peace talks, resulting in a substantive but incomplete peace
<br>proposal. The Commissioner confided that he had offered the COCE a
<br>secret, one- or two-day meeting as a confidence-building exercise.
<br>He said the COCE is considering the offer but is stuck on the
<br>meeting location: Colombia (difficult for the ELN), Venezuela
<br>(difficult for the GOC), or Norway (a logistical nightmare but
<br>still a possibility). If successful, Pearl contemplated having two
<br>or three such meetings before the end of the current Uribe
<br>Administration. The Ambassador reminded Pearl that the Embassy had
<br>contracted a U.S.-based academic familiar with the process to
<br>consult on ways for the USG to be supportive of GOC efforts with
<br>the ELN. Pearl was grateful for USAID assistance in drafting white
<br>papers that outlined the ELN negotiating positions.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Common Ground
<br>
<br>-------------
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) Pearl said that both guerrilla groups had responded
<br>through sensitive channels with the same four minimum conditions
<br>for a peace agreement. First, the GOC must be willing to give its
<br>unambiguous and unanimous support for the agreement. Signing a
<br>peace agreement, Pearl emphasized, was just the beginning of the
<br>process and the terrorist groups have, because of historical
<br>precedent, a deep distrust of the GOC's good faith. Second, the
<br>military must be included in the process, a reminder that the
<br>Colombian Army opposed and worked against civilian-led peace talks
<br>in the 1980s and 1990s. Third, both groups seek participation by
<br>the private sector, which they view as the true power behind
<br>Colombian politics. Fourth, the ELN and FARC want some form of
<br>international accompaniment for the process. Pearl foresees a
<br>positive role for the international community once the process has
<br>reached a sufficient level of maturity. International well-wishers
<br>coming in too early, he stressed, could aggravate the delicate
<br>process. Regarding a U.S. role, he said that both groups were
<br>interested in an agreement with the United States over illegal drug
<br>cultivation, which they viewed as a social problem.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Wild Cards: Reelection and Venezuela
<br>
<br>-------------------------------------
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶7. (S/NF) Pearl said there were two schools of thought about the
<br>impact of an Uribe third term on negotiations. Some believed that
<br>the third term would only exacerbate the tensions between Uribe and
<br>Chavez, which could play to the FARC's advantage. Others thought
<br>that the reelection would cause the FARC to despair at four more
<br>years of Uribe's Democratic Security policy and to consider
<br>negotiations. Ambassador Brownfield added that Venezuela's
<br>political and material support to the FARC could be a game-changer,
<br>especially if Venezuela were to give the FARC portable
<br>surface-to-air missiles (MANPADS). Pearl agreed that such weapons
<br>could upset the strategic balance of the conflict.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>COMMENT
<br>
<br>-------
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶8. (S/NF) Pearl's presentation was structured, logical, and
<br>rehearsed. He clearly wanted to control our expectations over what
<br>could be accomplished in the short run. That said, it is a
<br>realistic plan given that Colombians will be seized with choosing
<br>(or reelecting) a president for much of 2010. We should continue
<br>our support of the GOC as it develops these initiatives, being
<br>careful not to get too far out in front. End comment.
