<br>ONS 1.4 B/D 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) Summary and comment: Ridouane Khalid and Khaled Ben 
<br>Mustafa, two of the three ex-Guantanamo (GTMO) detainees 
<br>returned to French custody on March 7, were formally placed 
<br>under investigation on "terrorist conspiracy" charges March 
<br>11 by terrorism investigating judges Jean-Louis Bruguiere and 
<br>Jean-Francois Ricard. Later that evening, a "liberty and 
<br>detention" judge upheld the terrorism judges' request that 
<br>Ben Mustafa be sent to pretrial detention. Curiously, a few 
<br>hours later on March 12, the same "liberty and detention" 
<br>judge examined Ridouane Khalid's case and ordered him 
<br>released pending trial. It is highly likely that the office 
<br>of the Paris Prosecutor will appeal the judge's decision, but 
<br>for the time being Khalid remains released on bail. The 
<br>Khalid decision is the first setback for Judges Bruguiere and 
<br>Ricard as they work on the "French detainees in Guantanamo" 
<br>dossier. For the first time in this dossier, a defense 
<br>lawyer won a victory for his client, a fact that would 
<br>embolden the lawyers for the other five detainees still in 
<br>pretrial detention. When reached March 14, Ricard (strictly 
<br>protect throughout) told Poloff that he was not optimistic 
<br>regarding the dossier. He said the "liberty and detention" 
<br>judge's decision could impact the continued detention of the 
<br>other five detainees. End summary and comment. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) Poloff spoke with Judges Bruguiere and Ricard on March 
<br>10 regarding the three ex-GTMO detainees returned to French 
<br>custody on Monday, March 7. They confirmed that on March 11, 
<br>they would charge Ridouane Khalid and Khaled Ben Mustafa with 
<br>"terrorist conspiracy," which carries with it a maximum 
<br>sentence of 10 years. They also revealed that the cases 
<br>against the two would be more difficult than for the four 
<br>original detainees returned to France in the summer of 2004. 
<br>Bruguiere said that the DST had not uncovered any substantial 
<br>additional information during the interrogation of Khalid and 
<br>Ben Mustafa, which contrasts with the new information they 
<br>had garnered from the original four detainees during their 
<br>initial interrogation. Ricard confirmed this, and added that 
<br>both Khalid and Ben Mustafa did not have substantial records 
<br>of involvement in Afghanistan, in contrast to the original 
<br>four. Regarding Ben Mustafa, Ricard said they had 
<br>comparatively little information, due largely to the fact 
<br>that Ben Mustafa had "barely enough time to set down his 
<br>suitcase in Afghanistan before 9/11." The French have a 
<br>little more on Khalid, but only because he was known to 
<br>French services as being active in underground Islamist 
<br>circles in Paris as far back as 1998. For these reasons, 
<br>both judges said they personally considered the cases against 
<br>Khalid and Ben Mustafa more difficult to prosecute. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) Regarding the third detainee, Mustaq Ali Patel, 
<br>Bruguiere confirmed March 10 that the French had no 
<br>derogatory information against him, and for this reason, he 
<br>was released on March 9 (reftel A). He also said that Patel 
<br>has severe mental and physical problems, and Bruguiere 
<br>believed these problems had been exacerbated during Patel's 
<br>multi-year imprisonment in Guantanamo. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) Following the formal announcement of an investigation, 
<br>Khalid and Ben Mustafa were brought before a "liberty and 
<br>detention" judge whose role is to determine whether or not 
<br>the defendant should be released on bail pending the trial or 
<br>remanded to pretrial detention. Ben Mustafa went first and 
<br>the judge ruled in favor of Bruguiere and Ricard's requests 
<br>that he be kept in pretrial detention. Khalid went before 
<br>the same judge a few hours later and, surprisingly, given the 
<br>similarity of the cases against the defendants, the judge 
<br>ordered Khalid released pending trial. According to the 
<br>Saturday (March 12) edition of Le Monde newspaper, the judge 
<br>said Khalid's long detention in Guantanamo and the fact that 
<br>the other five ex-GTMO detainees were in pretrial detention 
<br>minimized Khalid's flight risk. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) Judge Ricard's reaction March 14 reflected his 
<br>surprise with the decision; "Don't ask me for explanations 
<br>(for the judge's decision) because I don't have any. The 
<br>(liberty and detention) judge's reasoning makes no sense." 
<br>Ricard said he had been unsure of the two cases against 
<br>Khalid and Ben Mustafa, but expected nonetheless that the 
<br>judge would either approve the detention of both or reject 
<br>the detention of both. Ricard said there were few 
<br>differences in the cases against Khalid and Ben Mustafa. 
<br>However, he speculated that the following three issues may 
<br>have influenced the judge to order Khalid's release: 1) 
<br>Khalid's lawyer, Paul-Albert Iweins, is a former president of 
<br>the Paris Bar and as such, is extremely skilled and 
<br>reputable. This probably had a significant influence on the 
<br>"liberty and detention" judge, said Ricard. 2) Khalid is 
<br>hepatitis-C positive and this, combined with other more minor 
<br>medical issues, may have decreased the judge's fear that 
<br>Khalid was a flight risk; and 3) Khalid was less talkative 
<br>during the DST's interrogation, said Ricard, which made 
<br>compiling a dossier against him significantly more difficult. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S) Moving forward, Ricard said it was probable that the 
<br>Paris Prosecutor's office, upon recommendation of the 
<br>terrorism investigating judges, would appeal Khalid's release 
<br>this week. In addition, Ben Mustafa's lawyer has filed two 
<br>separate appeals for his release, one of which will be heard 
<br>this week, and the other shortly thereafter. Ricard said the 
<br>appeals were based largely on the fact that the cases against 
<br>Ben Mustafa and Khalid were similar. The lawyer will argue, 
<br>said Ricard, that if Khalid was released, Ben Mustafa must be 
<br>released as well. Ricard said that the other four ex-GTMO 
<br>detainees in pretrial detention since summer 2004 would 
<br>undoubtedly resubmit petitions for their release based on the 
<br>success of Khalid's lawyer. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) Comment: In our dealings with Ricard and Bruguiere on 
<br>the Guantanamo detainees issue, Ricard has consistently 
<br>evinced more uncertainty and his reaction to this first 
<br>setback demonstrates that. The fact that the "liberty and 
<br>detention" judge allowed bail for one defendant and not the 
<br>other suggests that incarceration in Guantanamo was not a 
<br>decisive factor in deciding pretrial detention. Ricard and 
<br>Bruguiere remain determined to pursue charges against six of 
<br>the seven GTMO detainees, although there is little doubt that 
<br>their defense lawyers will redouble their efforts to obtain 
<br>bail for the other detainees as a result of the "liberty and 
<br>detention" judge's decision. End comment.
