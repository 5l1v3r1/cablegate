<br>SUBJECT: GUINEA: AMBASSADOR MOLLER'S CONSULTATIONS IN 
<br>PARIS (OCTOBER 29-30) 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Andrew Young, Political Counselor, 1.4 (b/d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: French officials generally agreed with U.S. 
<br>Ambassador to Guinea Patricia Moller on the need for the 
<br>international community to develop a visible process or 
<br>framework on Guinea that could lead to a transition to a 
<br>democratic government, with Burkina Faso President Campaore's 
<br>intervention a possible vehicle for forming such a process. 
<br>Presidential Africa Advisor Andre Parant plans to travel to 
<br>Ouagadougou for meetings with Campaore on November 2, where 
<br>Parant will offer France's support. While agreeing that 
<br>junta leader Dadis Camara had to be removed from power, they 
<br>believed that Dadis could be part of the solution to the 
<br>problem if handled properly through the right combination of 
<br>"carrots and sticks." The French were encouraged by the 
<br>African Union's October 29 decision to take a firm stance on 
<br>Guinea, and they believed that the AU, following ECOWAS's 
<br>lead, could play a useful role in resolving the crisis in 
<br>Guinea. Once the transition process gains traction, France 
<br>is prepared to commit resources and expertise, especially for 
<br>reforming Guinea's military. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) U.S. Ambassador to Guinea Patricia Moller, met, 
<br>separately, with MFA AF A/S-equivalent Stephane Gompertz and 
<br>Presidential Africa Advisor Remi Marechaux on October 30, 
<br>following her meeting on October 29 with MOD Africa Analyst 
<br>Jerome Spinoza. AF-watcher attended the meeting with 
<br>Marechaux; AF-assistant attended the meetings with Gompertz 
<br>and Spinoza. MFA Guinea desk officer Ann'laure Hare attended 
<br>the meeting with Gompertz. 
<br>
<br>Meeting with Gompertz (MFA) 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>¶3. (C) Gompertz began by asking what Ambassador Moller 
<br>planned to do concerning her credentials. She replied that 
<br>she would not present her credentials to the Dadis government 
<br>and, if pressed, would say that she would do so only when a 
<br>democratically-elected government was in place in Conakry. 
<br>Gompertz explained that France's recently arrived Ambassador 
<br>(Jean Graebling) had similarly refused to present his 
<br>credentials. The CNDD Foreign Minister informed Graebling 
<br>that, as a result, Graelbing would have no access to regime 
<br>officials. Gompertz observed that Ambassadors Graebling and 
<br>Moller would be in similar situations. He and Ambassador 
<br>Moller looked forward to close working relations between the 
<br>Ambassadors Graebling and Moller in Conakry. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Gompertz noted the AU's October 29 communique on 
<br>Guinea, which he deemed very helpful. He commented on EU 
<br>efforts to develop travel bans and asset freezes. Ambassador 
<br>Moller said the USG was taking similar steps. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) On the broader issue of next steps, Ambassador Moller 
<br>stressed ultimate priority of avoiding a melt-down in Guinea, 
<br>with which Gompertz agreed. To accomplish that, Ambassador 
<br>Moller said that it was imperative for the international 
<br>community to establish a process or framework -- the more 
<br>visible the better -- to show that there was a serious 
<br>commitment on moving Guinea away from the abyss and towards 
<br>an acceptable democratic transition, which could be centered 
<br>on African institutions such as the AU or ECOWAS, with the 
<br>support and participation of other members of the 
<br>international community. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Gompertz agreed, and he said that Burkina Faso 
<br>President Campaore, who had already taken up a mediator's 
<br>role, could be the focus of such an effort. Gompertz said 
<br>that Presidential AF-advisor Andre Parant was going to 
<br>Burkina Faso and would meet with Campaore on November 2, to 
<br>discuss Guinea as a first priority, and also Niger. Gompertz 
<br>indicated that Parant would try to encourage movement on 
<br>Campaore's part, although Gompertz noted Campaore's 
<br>preference to move deliberately. He also mentioned that 
<br>Campaore had personal economic interests in Guinea (as he had 
<br>in many other African countries) that would be a factor in 
<br>his decision-making. Gompertz encouraged the U.S. to talk to 
<br>Campaore. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Gompertz, while harboring no illusions about Dadis 
<br>(describing his as "dangerous" and "insane") nonetheless 
<br>believed that Dadis should be part of the solution and not 
<br>simply isolated and scorned. He needed to be offered an exit 
<br>or a way out. Gompertz mused on the possibility that Morocco 
<br>(where the junta has cached much of its wealth) or Libya 
<br>could serve as points of exile, although Ambassador Moller 
<br>indicated that Morocco had signaled that it was not 
<br>interested in hosting an exiled Dadis. Gompertz said that 
<br>other factors to be considered were the danger of civil war 
<br>(the Forestiers had to be reassured that Dadis's departure 
<br>
<br>did not signal a return to Peul or Malinke dominance over the 
<br>Forestiers) and the need to accommodate Guinea's military. 
<br>Gompertz observed that a transition to a democratic 
<br>government was essential, in order to avoid a "melt down" or 
<br>else a drift into a Zimbabwe-like state, which would be 
<br>hardly any better. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Asked about the departure of French citizens from 
<br>Guinea, Gompertz said that about 500 of 1,800 had left 
<br>following the GOF's public suggestion that citizens leave 
<br>voluntarily rather than wait for a possible evacuation under 
<br>emergency conditions. He noted that of the remainder, many 
<br>were dual nationals or long-term residents not inclined to 
<br>leave in any case. Gompertz said that the suggestion to 
<br>leave was more anticipatory in nature and to prepare for the 
<br>worst, not an indication that conditions were at an extreme. 
<br>(Marechaux claimed that about 800 French, out of 2,300, had 
<br>departed, and that there were an estimated 600 known dual 
<br>nationals who would likely never leave. He also verified 
<br>that the GOF-supported school in Conakry would remain closed 
<br>until an acceptable transition government was in place.) 
<br>
<br>Meeting with Marechaux (Presidency) 
<br>----------------------------------- 
<br>¶9. (C) Presidential Africa Advisor, Remi Marechaux, who will 
<br>travel with Parant to Ouagadougou, echoed many of the points 
<br>made by Gompertz. In particular, he noted that it was 
<br>important to support Campaore and allow him to lead, even 
<br>though there would be frustrations that Campaore wanted to 
<br>"maintain leeway" and that the mediation would happen "on 
<br>African time." Part of the problem was that Campaore relies 
<br>on only 5-6 advisors to assist with all his mediations, 
<br>including for Togo and Cote d'Ivoire, and that even FM Yoda 
<br>could not speak authoritatively on Campaore's thinking. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) In Marechaux's opinion, Campaore was "scared by the 
<br>strength of the international community's strength of 
<br>reaction" to the September 28 violence. Therefore, Marechaux 
<br>said that in Ouagadougou, Parant would make clear that France 
<br>would support Campaore, if requested, on delivering 
<br>demarches, providing ideas on the way forward, and even 
<br>helping with travel or other logistic requirements. 
<br>Marechaux agreed with Ambassador Moller that it is important 
<br>to get some visibility on a specific transition plan soon, 
<br>but described the situation as still in the "threat stage," 
<br>and that "we still have 2-3 weeks before we need to be 
<br>greatly concerned about a lack of progress." 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Marechaux described the sanctions and UN Commission 
<br>of Inquiry as "tools" that should not be confused with the 
<br>international community's "goals." In creating the sanctions 
<br>list, there was a vibrant debate within the GOF, with some 
<br>wanting the sanctions to be more targeted to "destabilize" 
<br>the junta. Now that the list is, in the end, quite 
<br>inclusive, it needs to remain dynamic so that those listed 
<br>understanding there is the option of being removed from the 
<br>list if they depart the junta and help the transition process 
<br>-- a process that leads to the removal of Dadis. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Parant will also discuss with Campaore the question 
<br>of what to do with Dadis, reminding Campaore that he needs to 
<br>reach out to countries who might accept the junta leader 
<br>should he step down. France also wants Campaore to consider 
<br>how to avoid the possibility of an International Criminal 
<br>Court (ICC) case against Dadis, which, Marechaux added, would 
<br>be a disincentive for the junta to agree to give up power. 
<br>Marachaux speculated that perhaps some kind of in-country 
<br>court could be established which, in the end, would allow 
<br>Dadis and others a way to be relocated. 
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Another critical step raised by Marechaux is to plan 
<br>for some kind of international observer force, noting the 
<br>effectiveness of 50 or so ECOWAS troops who helped during 
<br>Togo's 2007 elections by assuring that military forces stayed 
<br>in their barracks and by conducting joint patrols with Togo's 
<br>police and gendarmes. In Marechaux's opinion, it would be 
<br>difficult for Guinean authorities to refuse a similar ECOWAS 
<br>plan. However, a large intervention force was not realistic. 
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) Marechaux stated that reforming the military needed 
<br>to be included in the transition plan, and that the U.S. and 
<br>France needed to work together on this. He asserted that the 
<br>majority of Guinea's military was not implicated in the 
<br>September 28 attacks, and that Guinea's gendarme force had 
<br>performed well. Dadis may have recruited up to 2,500 
<br>fighters from Liberia, but the Guinean forces loyal to the 
<br>junta numbered only about 2,000. This left a significant 
<br>military to work with. Marechaux raised the idea of possibly 
<br>training Guinean troops for UN peacekeeping duty, effectively 
<br>
<br>reducing the influence of the military in Guinea. Ambassador 
<br>Moller remarked that peacekeeping training and deployment had 
<br>been a successful strategy in Burundi. 
<br>
<br>Meeting with Spinoza (MOD) 
<br>-------------------------- 
<br>¶15. (C) Jerome Spinoza at the MOD's Strategic Affairs 
<br>Delegation, befitting his position as an analyst, offered a 
<br>broader, less operational view of Guinea during his October 
<br>29 meeting with Ambassador Moller. Of the three 
<br>interlocutors, he was the one who most directly counseled 
<br>against demonizing and isolating Dadis. He too shared no 
<br>illusions about Dadis but he thought that Dadis was more 
<br>reasonable and susceptible to persuasion than others might 
<br>think, even if only at the level of self-interest. He 
<br>believed that Dadis should be part of any process to end the 
<br>junta's control of Guinea and to move to a more acceptable 
<br>government. Spinoza agreed with Ambassador Moller's views on 
<br>the need to establish a process for channeling Guinea in the 
<br>right direction and the need to avoid a complete collapse in 
<br>Guinea, which would be bad for Guinea and disastrous for the 
<br>region, which was grappling with recoveries in in Sierra 
<br>Leone, Liberia, and Cote d'Ivoire. Spinoza acknowledged that 
<br>some of his colleagues considered him "pro-junta," but he 
<br>said that this was only because he believed one had to work 
<br>with the junta rather than isolate it or back it into a 
<br>corner where its only choice might be aggression. 
<br>
<br>COMMENT 
<br>------- 
<br>¶16. (C) The French clearly welcomed the opportunity to 
<br>consult with Ambassador Moller and we expect she will a close 
<br>and collaborative relationship with the French in Conakry. 
<br>More importantly, in each of her discussions, French 
<br>agreement on the need for a visible international process 
<br>strengthened, with a focus on Campaore's initiative. END 
<br>COMMENT. 
<br>
<br>¶17. (U) Ambassador Moller has cleared this message. 
<br>
<br>¶18. (U) Conakry minimize considered.
