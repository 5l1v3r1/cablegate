<br>Subject: (s) germany requests information concerning
<br>iranian procurement of xxxxxxxxxxxx test chamber
<br>
<br>Ref: a. 07 state 75839
<br>b. State 15220
<br>c. Berlin 195
<br>d. State 40087
<br>e. Berlin 511
<br>
<br>Classified By: Glbal Affairs Unit Chief Don L. Brown for
<br>reasons 14 (b) and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (u) this is an action request. Please see para 5.
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) On May 13, MFA Export Control Division Desk Officer
<br>Wiebke Wacker provided Global Affairs Oficer with a
<br>German-language nonpaper requesting nformation from U.S.
<br>concerning an Iranian natioal, xxxxxxxxxxxx, in connection with the Iranian
<br>procurement of a German origin environmental test chamber
<br>from the firm xxxxxxxxxxxx. In support of a
<br>current investigation, the Germans are specifically
<br>interested in knowing whether the USG has any information
<br>indicating that xxxxxxxxxxxx was aware that the Iranian
<br>firm Shahid Bakeri Industrial Group (SBIG) would be the
<br>actual end-user of the environmental test chamber.
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) In a May 5 meeting, Wacker provided Global Affairs
<br>Officer with further background information concerning this
<br>information request. According to the German Customs Office
<br>of Criminal Investigation (Zollkriminalamt, or ZKA), Wacker
<br>said, xxxxxxxxxxxx was confronted (and possibly detained)
<br>by U.S. authorities in February 2008 while applying for a
<br>visa at AmConGen Dubai. Wacker said the ZKA has assessed
<br>that information concerning xxxxxxxxxxxx business contacts with
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx is a critical piece of evidence needed to
<br>support the ZKA's ongoing investigation into xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>and Iranian efforts to procure an environmental
<br>chamber from xxxxxxxxxxxx.
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) Begin informal Embassy translation of German-language
<br>nonpaper:
<br>
<br>With reference to the Non-Papers from June 1, 2007, August 3,
<br>2007, December 18, 2007, February 15, 2008, and April 21,
<br>2008 regarding the procurement of an environmental test
<br>chamber by the Iranian xxxxxxxxxxxx from the German xxxxxxxxxxxx 
<br>via Romania and Croatia, we take this opportunity
<br>to ask the U.S. authorities about the following points:
<br>
<br>The German export control authorities have learned that
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx was approached by U.S. authorities about
<br>these matters. Because the German authorities have also
<br>undertaken investigative measures, we are interested in
<br>information concerning the results of these conversations.
<br>
<br>The U.S. authorities reported in their Non Paper from April
<br>21, 2008, that the Iranian firm SBIG is the actual intended
<br>recipient of the test chamber. The German export control
<br>authorities are accordingly interested in knowing whether the
<br>German citizen xxxxxxxxxxxx had knowledge of this
<br>end-user.
<br>
<br>We thank you for the information in connection with the
<br>SBIG's procurement attempts and we look forward to continuing
<br>our excellent cooperation in the area of export controls.
<br>
<br>End text of informal Embassy translation.
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) ACTION REQUEST: Post requests Department guidance
<br>in responding to the questions posed in the German nonpaper.
