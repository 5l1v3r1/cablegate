<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Meeting with cabinet on December 30 to 
<br>evaluate his third year in office, Bolivian President Evo 
<br>Morales justified once again his decision to expel Ambassador 
<br>Philip S. Goldberg. Morales noted that with the departure of 
<br>Ambassador Goldberg, the political opposition had "bottomed 
<br>out," and concluded that Goldberg was "clearly commanding the 
<br>conspiracy against democracy" in Bolivia. Morales went on to 
<br>praise Bolivia's efforts against narco-trafficking, calling 
<br>Bolivia the "most outstanding country in Latin America" in 
<br>the fight against drugs. Nevertheless, Morales restated his 
<br>hope that bilateral relations would improve under 
<br>President-elect Obama. Post questions Morales' logic, but 
<br>understands that in the face of declining natural gas prices 
<br>and corruption scandals within his administration, Morales 
<br>needs to distract domestic attention by using the U.S. as his 
<br>strawman once again. End summary.

<br>¶2. (U) In a year-end meeting December 30 to evaluate his 
<br>third year in office, President Evo Morales took time to 
<br>validate and celebrate his decision on September 11 to expel 
<br>Ambassador Philip Goldberg, whom he accused of leading a 
<br>conspiracy to topple the Morales regime. "After suffering 
<br>that attack of the (political) right, of the empire, I was 
<br>not wrong in that moment when I decided the Ambassador had to 
<br>leave. The Ambassador leaves, the opposition bottoms out -- 
<br>clearly someone was commanding the conspiracy against 
<br>democracy, even against the national government itself." 
<br>
<br>¶3. (U) Morales went on to accuse the Bush administration of 
<br>violating its international commitments in the fight against 
<br>narco-trafficking, saying Bolivia "is the most outstanding 
<br>country in Latin America in the fight against drug 
<br>trafficking." Local press reports and even the government's 
<br>own media service noted that the precipitous fall in 
<br>relations had been exacerbated by Morales' "personal 
<br>decision" to suspend Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) 
<br>activities in the country. The official media service went a 
<br>step further, adding that Morales also suspended CIA 
<br>activity, and that the U.S. brought the suspension on itself 
<br>by "meddling in internal affairs." Despite his attacks on 
<br>Ambassador Goldberg, the Bush administration, and the "empire 
<br>of the north" generally, Morales was quick to state once 
<br>again that bilateral relations would be re-evaluated once 
<br>President-elect Obama was in office.

<br>¶4. (C) True to form, Morales' mention of declaring Ambassador 
<br>Goldberg persona non grata grabbed media attention and 
<br>distracted focus from more pressing matters, including the 
<br>Quintana corruption scandal, the falling price of natural gas 
<br>(and with it the possible reduction of Morales' popular Renta 
<br>Dignidad program), and his recent admission that some 
<br>cocaleros are selling their coca to be processed into 
<br>cocaine. As illogical as Morales' diatribes arguments are, 
<br>as long as he can get mileage out of such attacks, the 
<br>administration will continue to spread its vitriol.
