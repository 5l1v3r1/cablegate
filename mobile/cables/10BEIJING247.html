<br>REF: BEIJING 183 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Economic Minister Counselor Weinstein for reasons: 1.4(B), (D) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary. Despite media reports quoting Google 
<br>officials in the U.S. as saying Google is in talks with 
<br>China, a Ministry of Commerce official told a visiting U.S. 
<br>delegation on January 28 that "it would be better if Google 
<br>stopped telling the media that it is in negotiations with 
<br>China, since it is not." However, a Foreign Ministry 
<br>official told Poloff earlier this week there is going to be a 
<br>"meeting in Davos" that China hopes "will resolve everything 
<br>in an extremely low-key and quiet manner." Separately, 
<br>several U.S.-China dialogues related to IT issues were 
<br>unexpectedly postponed by China this week due to the 
<br>purported unavailability of key officials who had previously 
<br>confirmed to attend. It is unclear, however, whether the 
<br>postponements are related. Google remained the hot topic 
<br>this week among our contacts in China,s information 
<br>technology (IT) industry, with those in foreign firms 
<br>generally supportive and appreciative of the Secretary,s 
<br>speech on internet freedom. Expat executives said that while 
<br>they expect the USG's highlighting of internet freedom and 
<br>requests for an investigation of Google's allegations will 
<br>lead to frictions with China, they welcomed the intervention 
<br>in what they see as an increasingly difficult operating 
<br>environment. End summary. 
<br>
<br>GOOGLE REMAINS HOT 
<br>------------------ 
<br>¶2. (C) Google's decision to potentially walk away from 
<br>China's market of nearly 400 million internet users continues 
<br>to spark extensive discussion on a range of important related 
<br>issues: censorship and information flow; principled versus 
<br>bottom-line decision-making; protection of corporate 
<br>proprietary information and intellectual property; and how 
<br>companies can effect positive change from within a foreign 
<br>economy. Secretary Clinton's January 21 speech on Internet 
<br>freedom touched a nerve in China's leadership (reftel), and 
<br>rightly so according to our local business contacts who 
<br>regularly cite the increasingly challenging business climate 
<br>in China. Locally-based western businessmen and consultants 
<br>are viewing Google's confrontation with the Chinese 
<br>authorities with a fascinated mix of admiration and caution, 
<br>though few are willing to bet on the ultimate outcome. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Western companies Chinese employees are, not 
<br>surprisingly, sometimes more sympathetic to the PRC,s 
<br>position. XXXXXXXXXXXX commented that Google
<br>has played matters badly, suggesting it  should have tried to
<br>help PRC authorities understand what  Google provides "is
<br>good for China." Xiao stated he thinks  Google approache
<br> the problem incorrectly, citing Bill Gates'  position that
<br>companies must "follow the laws of the country  in which
<br>they operate." Xiao also intimated that, as a  Chinese citizen,
<br>he could empathize with the Chinese  government’s fears that
<br>Google's services could be used by  Dalai Lama supporters to
<br>publicize their views throughout  China. Liu Tao, Government
<br>Affairs Manager for Caterpillar, 
<br>notes that the parties involved in the Google issue should 
<br>discuss the issue without "being so emotional." Liu, a 
<br>Chinese citizen, said that the Chinese government was "not 
<br>acting emotionally" over this issue. 
<br>
<br>PREDICTIONS FOR A RESOLUTION 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>¶4. (C) A visiting London-based XXXXXXXXXXXX executive
<br>believes the  Google matter was a "good shaking of the tree
<br> for China  issues needing greater visibility. Although he predicted 
<br>impact from Google would not necessarily change the game for 
<br>European interests here, he noted that Google has established 
<br>close relations with UK Conservatives, and predicted a 
<br>potential future Conservative government would be very 
<br>supportive of the tenets in Secretary Clinton's recent 
<br>speech. Another Beijing-based XXXXXXXXXXXX consultant
<br>compared  Google,s experience to Intel, which in 2003
<br>threatened to  withdraw from China after Chinese authorities
<br>sought to  impose technological modifications to its encryption-
<br>enabled  products. The Chinese government ultimately backed down,
<br>but  our local contact believes Chinese payback continues today 
<br>and is one reason China insists that homegrown technology  be 
<br>
<br>BEIJING 00000247 002 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>co-installed in any WI-FI-enabled phones/communication 
<br>devices. The latter local contact further suggested Google 
<br>could pursue resolution of its current impasse by lobbying 
<br>technologically-enlightened senior statesmen, especially more 
<br>pro-business ones, who might sway China's leadership to 
<br>address Google's censorship issues more moderately. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Many contacts have opined that it appears Google will 
<br>likely remain in China, albeit with a more limited presence, 
<br>i.e., without a search engine service. Although Google has 
<br>firmly positioned itself on censorship matters and hence will 
<br>likely have little choice but to take down its Google.cn 
<br>search site, they believe Google executives' public 
<br>statements and vested interests still coincide with 
<br>maintaining at least some presence in China. 
<br>
<br>LONG TERM OUTLOOK POSITIVE, SHORT TERM FALLOUT 
<br>--------------------------------------------- - 
<br>¶6. (C) Another IT association representative told Econoff 
<br>that interest in the Google case "highlights the growing 
<br>number of Chinese measures and policy goals that diminish the 
<br>investment environment in China... part of a troubling 
<br>pattern that is making it increasingly difficult for foreign 
<br>firms to do business." Business contacts told ConGen 
<br>Shanghai that they "welcome a more assertive voice on behalf 
<br>of the U.S. While it may not be good for U.S.-China 
<br>relations in the short term, it will be better in the long 
<br>term. We need to stand for what we believe in." Injecting a 
<br>more cautionary note, however, another Shanghai businessmen 
<br>warns that "America will not advance its objectives with 
<br>regard to the bilateral relationship by telling the Chinese 
<br>government that it is working to put new internet 
<br>technologies into the hands of dissidents. In this particular 
<br>face-off, at least, the Chinese are 'spinning' the issue far 
<br>more effectively than the Americans." 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Fallout beyond China's borders continues. Two 
<br>governmental dialogues (the U.S. China ICT Consultations, 
<br>previously scheduled for February 9, 2010, and the 
<br>DOC-Ministry of Industry and Information Technology on 
<br>February 2, 2010 - both in Washington DC) were postponed this 
<br>week due to purported unavailability of key officials who had 
<br>previously confirmed to attend. Congen Shanghai has found 
<br>many IPR-related meetings cancelled this week. 
<br>Interestingly, officials from the Swedish Embassy were 
<br>summoned to the MFA to receive a protest of statements made 
<br>by the Swedish FM supportive of Secretary Clinton's speech on 
<br>Internet Freedom. According to our Swedish contacts, the MFA 
<br>charged the Swedes with damaging ties during the 60th 
<br>anniversary of Chinese-Swedish diplomatic relationship. 
<br>
<br>WHAT'S DRIVING CHINA 
<br>-------------------- 
<br>¶8. (C) According to another well-respected tech sector 
<br>analyst here, a number of historical, cultural, and 
<br>technological factors have coalesced to put China in a 
<br>technologically-aggressive state-of-mind. One contributing 
<br>factor was Microsoft's flubbed 2004 "black screen" strategy 
<br>to deter intellectual property theft by darkening computer 
<br>monitors running unlicensed Windows operating software. This 
<br>consultant believes that example of U.S. technology 
<br>effectively wielding power over China's personal computers 
<br>helped spur China's aggressive campaign for source codes and 
<br>its own technology. This, combined with growing Chinese 
<br>pride, economic clout and influence, and the "weakened" 
<br>position of the U.S. and its allies after the global economic 
<br>downturn, are emboldening the Chinese to take ever more 
<br>aggressive positions in advancing its innovative industries 
<br>at the expense of foreign ones. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) A local Microsoft executive applauds the Secretary's 
<br>speech and the Administration's commitment "to organize 
<br>sustained, targeted, persistent engagement on the full range 
<br>of Internet-related issues" with China. This executive said 
<br>the Secretary's remarks were "right on point," particularly 
<br>for companies who "desperately need the help of the USG" in 
<br>the face of "harassment, threats and actual shutdowns of 
<br>service, threats of licenses being revoked, resistance to 
<br>provide legal authority, mandates to place servers in China, 
<br>etc." Our local APCO contact described the Google issue as a 
<br>"stirring of the beehive," but says the kind of harassment 
<br>Microsoft describes is a fact of worsening life here which 
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>the Google incident only helps spotlight.
