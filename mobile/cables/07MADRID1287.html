<br>Classified By: Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre for Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary. Former Spanish President Jose Maria Aznar
<br>told the Ambassador on June 28 that he viewed with great
<br>concern the "malignant affect" that the Zapatero government's
<br>policies were having on Spain, and he was dismayed to see the
<br>Spanish nation slowly eroding as more power continued to
<br>devolve to Catalonia and the Basque region. Aznar confided
<br>to the Ambassador that if he saw his country descend to
<br>extremely dire straits, he would consider "stepping back in,"
<br>evidently implying that he would seek to return to leadership
<br>of the Popular Party. Aznar said that he and the current
<br>leadership of the Popular Party had been surprised by that
<br>day's announcement by IMF Managing Director Rodrigo Rato that
<br>he would step down this fall and return to Spain to spend
<br>more time with his family. On North Africa, Aznar admonished
<br>the U.S. for its current efforts to work with Morocco to
<br>solve the Western Sahara issue and said that this was a "bad
<br>idea." The Ambassador expressed condolences for the six
<br>Spanish soldiers killed recently in Lebanon and said the USG
<br>hoped the GOS would still fulfill its commitments both in
<br>that country and in Afghanistan. Aznar replied that Zapatero
<br>was weak and would cave to political pressure to reduce
<br>Spain's presence. The Ambassador urged that the PP refrain
<br>from complicating Spanish deployments in Afghanistan and
<br>Lebanon, given the strategic importance of those missions.
<br>Aznar replied that the PP had never pressured Zapatero on
<br>either deployment and would not do so in the future. The
<br>former President concluded the meeting by giving his views of
<br>the current situation in Cuba, Mexico, and Colombia. End
<br>Summary.
<br>
<br>//AZNAR ON RATO'S RETURN AND THE "DETERIORATION OF SPAIN"//
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Ambassador and Mrs. Aguirre hosted former Spanish
<br>President Jose Maria Aznar and his wife Ana Botella to a June
<br>28 dinner at the residence. President Aznar said that he had
<br>just come from a meeting at his FAES think tank that was
<br>attended by current Popular Party (PP) leader Mariano Rajoy
<br>and most of the PP leadership. Aznar said that he and other
<br>PP members had been surprised by that day's announcement by
<br>IMF Managing Director Rodrigo Rato that he would step down
<br>this fall and return to Spain to spend more time with his
<br>family. (Comment: Rato was Minister of the Economy in
<br>Aznar's government and rumors have circulated in Spain that
<br>Rato might make a strong running mate for Rajoy in Spain's
<br>national elections next year. Spanish press on June 29
<br>reported that Rato provided advanced notice of his
<br>resignation only to Rajoy. End Comment). Aznar said he was
<br>aware that Rato had become bored with his position at the IMF
<br>and yearned to return to Spain, and he believes that Rato may
<br>now assume a leading position in Spain's private sector.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Aznar told the Ambassador that Spain was currently in
<br>the hands of a very bad government whose policies were
<br>"malignantly affecting" the fabric of the country. Aznar
<br>views with great concern the continued devolution of power to
<br>Catalonia and the Basque region that is "slowly eroding
<br>Spain," as well as Zapatero's insistence on dredging up
<br>Spain's Civil War past. The Ambassador asked Aznar what his
<br>role would be if, in the former President's view, the
<br>Zapatero government continued to pursue policies deleterious
<br>to Spain, and Rajoy and the PP failed to gain any ground.
<br>Aznar responded that, "if I saw that Spain was really in
<br>despair, I may have to step back in to national politics."
<br>Aznar said that he could accept a Socialist government in
<br>Spain, but not this President and not this government. Aznar
<br>posited that the recently completed regional and local
<br>elections had been essentially a draw, and said that it was
<br>nearly impossible to predict what would happen in national
<br>elections that must be held by March 2008. Aznar said that
<br>the PP's biggest threat was voter apathy, as most Spanish
<br>citizens are complacently content with their personal
<br>economic situation, and that only a "major event" could shake
<br>the Spanish out of their lethargy. During the dinner, the
<br>Ambassador gave Aznar several opportunities to comment on the
<br>strengths of current PP leader Rajoy, but the President
<br>offered only lukewarm support for his successor.

<br>MADRID 00001287 002.2 OF 002
<br>
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Aznar told the Ambassador that the U.S. should cease
<br>its efforts to work with Algeria and Morocco to find a
<br>solution to the problems in Western Sahara. Aznar stated
<br>flatly that recent U.S. policy to move closer to Morocco on
<br>this issue was a "bad idea." The former President's opinion
<br>was that the U.S. would make concessions to Morocco and offer
<br>assistance, but then Morocco would "misuse these things."
<br>
<br>//LEBANON AND AFGHANISTAN//
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) The Ambassador expressed condolences for the six
<br>Spanish soldiers killed on June 24 in Lebanon and said he
<br>hoped the GOS would still fulfill its commitments both in
<br>that country and in Afghanistan. The Ambassador said it is
<br>vital for Spain to maintain a united front on key strategic
<br>issues such as these. Aznar replied that Zapatero was weak
<br>and would cave to political pressure to reduce Spain's
<br>presence in overseas deployments. The Ambassador replied
<br>that much of the political pressure on Zapatero in regards to
<br>Spanish deployments was in fact coming from the PP itself
<br>(REFTEL). Aznar denied that the PP had put political
<br>pressure on Zapatero to reduce Spain's commitment to its
<br>overseas deployments, the PP only wanted Zapatero to better
<br>explain the nature of the deployments to the Spanish people.
<br>He said the PP would not pressure the GOS on this in the
<br>future either.
<br>
<br>//LATIN AMERICA//
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) President Aznar briefly provided the Ambassador with
<br>his view on select Latin American countries. He said that
<br>Foreign Minister Moratinos' April visit to Havana was
<br>"predictable," as current Spanish leaders are "sympathetic to
<br>Castro, Communism, and this type of left-wing government."
<br>Aznar had just completed a trip to Mexico and believes that
<br>President Calderon is doing a "credible job." Aznar said
<br>Calderon admitted to having completely misjudged the depth
<br>and breadth of corruption in Mexico and that the pervasive
<br>influence of narcotics in the country was beyond
<br>comprehension. Turning to Colombia, Aznar said that
<br>President Uribe needs U.S. assistance and that recent U.S.
<br>Congressional actions to alter assistance to that country
<br>would do long-term damage to both U.S. and Colombian
<br>interests.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Comment. Aznar's lack of enthusiasm for his
<br>hand-picked successor, Rajoy, was noteworthy. Aznar never
<br>really left Spanish politics, but a public decision to resume
<br>a political career would likely reignite the pitched battle
<br>generated by the nature of the PP's loss following the March
<br>11, 2004 terrorist attacks. Aznar clearly is troubled by
<br>what he believes is happening in Spain and may have doubts
<br>that Rajoy is the man to return the PP to power. Although
<br>Rajoy and the current PP leadership trumpeted the results of
<br>regional elections, Aznar believes that it was a draw. The
<br>PP is confident heading into national elections, but a
<br>positive outcome is far from assured. If Rajoy cannot return
<br>his party to national power, individuals such as Rodrigo
<br>Rato, Madrid Mayor Alberto Ruiz-Gallardon, and perhaps former
<br>President Aznar may be waiting in the wings.
