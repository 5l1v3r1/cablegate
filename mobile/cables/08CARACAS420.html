<br>SUBJECT: EMBASSY STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS PLAN --
<br>COUNTERING CHAVEZ' ANTI-AMERICANISM
<br>
<br>
<br>Classified By: CLASSIFIED CONFIDENTIAL BY ACTING DCM
<br>ROBERT RICHARD DOWNES FOR REASON 1.4 (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (U) This is an action request - see paragraph 12.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Summary: Embassy Caracas requests DOD support in the
<br>execution of its strategic communications plan. The goal for
<br>this program is to influence the information environment
<br>within Venezuela. The strategy's goal is to counter the
<br>active and deliberate campaign by the Bolivarian Republic of
<br>Venezuela (BRV) to instill in the population a negative
<br>perception of the US. and distort more than 100 years of
<br>close and mutually beneficial relations between our two
<br>countries. Regrettably, the BRV has had some success. From a
<br>pre-Chavez level of over 65% approval, today the positive
<br>image of the US has fallen to a historic low of 31% in
<br>Venezuela. DOD support would greatly enhance existing
<br>Embassy Public Diplomacy and pro-democracy activities. End
<br>Summary.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Venezuela at the Crossroads: Venezuela once ranked
<br>with Colombia and the Central American countries as being
<br>most favorably disposed to the United States. However,
<br>attitudes towards America have deteriorated after several
<br>years of daily, well-funded BRV attacks against the USG.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Recent Developments: Embassy Caracas has developed a
<br>comprehensive strategic communications plan that incorporates
<br>various agencies within the mission. The Narcotic Affairs
<br>Section (NAS) has implemented a successful baseball clinic
<br>bringing former Venezuelan players and managers from the US
<br>major leagues to work with the youth in various Venezuelan
<br>cities as part of a narcotics demand reduction program. In
<br>addition, the Public Affairs Office targets the
<br>hard-to-penetrate youth and low-income sectors, programming
<br>Embassy leadership visits to all regions of Venezuela to
<br>interact with Venezuelan society, business, and civilian
<br>organizations. All of these programs have had an impact on
<br>Venezuelan perceptions towards the US within targeted
<br>sectors. Lack of resources limits our ability to reach a much
<br>larger population base.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Objectives: The strategic communications plan focuses
<br>on three key objectives; strengthening Venezuelan-US
<br>friendship, informing Venezuelans of enduring ties with
<br>America, and countering anti-US influence and activity. The
<br>US government needs to remind the Venezuelan people of its
<br>historic friendship ("We have been with you since Simon
<br>Bolivar") through continuous engagement, either with goodwill
<br>activities or offers of US assistance for emergency
<br>situations. We should also develop a message to enhance
<br>Venezuelan understanding of its natural partnership with the
<br>US through our long history of mutual support, strong
<br>commercial and agricultural ties, and the cultural and people
<br>to people links--large numbers of Venezuelan immigrants live
<br>in US ("We have been allies since the 1800s"). Finally, this
<br>strategic communications program must demonstrate commitment
<br>and support to the shared values and aspirations of the
<br>Venezuelan and American people regardless of Chavez'
<br>hostility or harsh rhetoric in order to counter anti-US
<br>influence and activity ("Both our nations stand for freedom,
<br>democracy, and prosperity.").
<br>
<br>¶6. (U) Themes: This program will center principally on three
<br>themes:
<br>
<br>The United States and Venezuela share common interests;
<br>--- Strong commercial and human ties.
<br>--- Both of our peoples respect and value civil and
<br>individual rights.
<br>
<br>Regional problems require the cooperation of all neighbors;
<br>--- Drug trafficking affects all countries and can
<br>only be effectively addressed through regional cooperation.
<br>--- Organized crime, international gangs, and
<br>trafficking in persons affect every society and are strongly
<br>correlated to peace and stability.
<br>
<br>Long historical and cultural ties;
<br>--- Wars for independence.
<br>--- Support to Venezuela against European
<br>intervention in the late 1800s.
<br>--- Baseball
<br>--- Large number of Venezuelan-American citizens.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Standards: Three continuous threads will be woven
<br>throughout this proposed program. First, the absolute
<br>veracity of the information will be assured prior to any
<br>program being publicized or aired. This standard will be in
<br>direct contrast to the misinformation, broken promises, and
<br>exaggerations of the Chavez administration. The second is a
<br>commitment to sending only positive messages about people.
<br>Negative messages tend to become associated with the sender.
<br>The third standard is to refrain from any attacks against the
<br>BRV or Chavez that would provide a pretext for Chavez to
<br>rally Venezuelans against "the empire."
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Concept of Operations: The Embassy would like to
<br>begin operations May 2008 and continue through April 2009. If
<br>the program is determined to be successful through attitude
<br>polling metrics, then the Embassy will seek funding for a
<br>second year. The first phase would consist of information
<br>gathering - surveying the environment to determine attitudes
<br>and opinions about the US, drugs, and corruption, and other
<br>areas in Venezuela that affect people in their everyday
<br>lives.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Based on these findings, in the second phase we would
<br>implement a campaign using newspaper ads, billboards, radio
<br>and TV spots. Embassy Caracas would focus their resources on
<br>key population areas of Venezuela and states outside the
<br>Caracas metropolitan area. Follow-on phases would include
<br>rock concerts, sporting events, and musical festivals. The
<br>final phase would converge on Caracas and concentrate on
<br>sending the message of our continued support to the
<br>Venezuelan people.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) The Embassy will evaluate the effectiveness of the
<br>program through feedback surveys. In order to gauge the
<br>program's long term effects a survey team will return to the
<br>target area between 90 and 120 days after the execution of
<br>the program. That will give time to the target audience to
<br>"digest" our message and show indications that they are
<br>either accepting or rejecting our message.
<br>
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Operational Timeline for the Strategic Communications
<br>Plan
<br>
<br>10-25 May - 1st Phase (Site Survey)
<br>
<br>1 June-30 August-2nd Phase (centered on outlying states)
<br>
<br>1 September-25 December 2nd Phase (Sporting events and
<br>musical tours)
<br>
<br>1 Jan 2009-30 April 2009-3rd Phase (Caracas focused)
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Action Request - Embassy requests support from
<br>Department of Defense in the execution of its Strategic
<br>Communications Plan. The embassy would like resources
<br>available by Mid-May 2008.
