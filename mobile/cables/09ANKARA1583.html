<br> 
<br>REF: ANKARA 1561 (EXDIS) 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: AMB James F. Jeffrey, for reasons 1.4 (b,d) 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) Summary:  During an October 21 meeting with MFA 
<br>Undersecretary Sinirlioglu, the Ambassador challenged Prime 
<br>Minister Erdogan's recent dismissal of international 
<br>community allegations that Iran intends to acquire nuclear 
<br>weapons as "gossip."  The Ambassador emphasized Iran will be 
<br>the single most important topic when Erdogan and POTUS meet 
<br>in Washington December 7.  In contrast to Erdogan, President 
<br>Gul November 2 pressed Iran to be transparent with IAEA 
<br>inspectors.  We will urge Gul and senior Turkish bureuacrats 
<br>to curb Erdogan's damaging defense of Iran's nuclear 
<br>activities.  End Summary 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) During an October 21 meeting with MFA Undersecretary 
<br>Sinirlioglu, the Ambassador challenged PM Erdogan's public 
<br>statement, made the previous day while he was in Tehran, 
<br>dismissing allegations of Iran's intent to acquire nuclear 
<br>weapons as "gossip."  Holding a copy of President Obama's 
<br>Pittsburgh Summit comdemnation of Iraq's nuclear ambitions, 
<br>the Ambassador asked Sinirlioglu if "this was the 'gossip'" 
<br>to which Erdogan had referred.  The Ambassador emphasized 
<br>that Erdogan's statement made Turkey vulnerable to 
<br>international community criticism should Iran balk on IAEA 
<br>inspection of its Qom reprocessing facility or second-party 
<br>reprocessing of its low-enriched uranium stockpile.  Erdogan 
<br>was, in effect, allowing the Iranians to infer a weakening of 
<br>the international community consensus against them.  The 
<br>Ambassador warned Sinirlioglu that Washington was now 
<br>wondering if it could any longer count on Turkey to help 
<br>contain Iran's profound challenge to regional peace and 
<br>stability. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) Implying Erdogan's use of the term "gossip" was 
<br>unconfirmed, Sinirlioglu claimed that the Turkish government 
<br>"fully supports the P5-plus-1."  He asserted the prime 
<br>minister's principled opposition to nuclear weapons in the 
<br>region.  He argued Erdogan's rhetoric is a tactical effort to 
<br>gain him credibility with the Middle Eastern street so he can 
<br>better place the anti-nuclear weapons message.  Though Turkey 
<br>"doesn't believe in sanctions," Sinirlioglu said, "we will 
<br>support consensus" in the Security Council.  The Ambassador 
<br>responded that Iran would be the single most important topic 
<br>of conversation when Erdogan and POTUS meet in Washington on 
<br>December 7. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (SBU) In marked contrast to Erdogan, President Gul 
<br>November 2 said Turkey is against nuclear weapons in its 
<br>region and the world, "especially in neighboring countries." 
<br>In remarks to reporters while enroute to Slovakia, Gul 
<br>reaffirmed Turkey's preference for diplomatic means (as 
<br>opposed to the use of military force) to compel Tehran's 
<br>adherence to its international obligations, but insisted that 
<br>Iran "...must be transparent and open to IAEA inspection in 
<br>order to overcome suspicions." 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) Comment:  Erdogan's recent comments on Iran's nuclear 
<br>program amount to a defense of Tehran's defiance of the 
<br>international community's will.  His desire for a "good" 
<br>Washington visit is the goad we will continue use to try to 
<br>turn him back towards the international community consensus 
<br>on Iran.  We will also emphasize to Erdogan's senior 
<br>bureuacrats and, when the opportunity arises, to President 
<br>Gul their interest in reining in Erdogan on Iran.
