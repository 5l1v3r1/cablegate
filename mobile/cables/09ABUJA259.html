<br>
<br>REF: ABUJA 203 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Robin R. Sanders for reasons 1.4. (b 
<br>& d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) SUMMARY: Shell's regional executive vice president for 
<br>Africa Ann Pickard and government relations representative Peter 
<br>Francis met with the Ambassador on January 27 in Abuja and provided 
<br>an update on problems in the oil and gas sector. Pickard said that 
<br>things were going from bad to worse, especially the security 
<br>situation. She said that Nigeria now had one of the highest negative 
<br>ratings for maritime operations, creating problems for Shell in 
<br>hiring oil tankers to load, as tanker operators will work only under 
<br>highly selective conditions. Last year there were about 80 piracy 
<br>attacks on land and water combined. This year already 15 have been 
<br>tallied, which includes 3 for Shell and 3 for Exxon. On corruption, 
<br>Pickard said that Nigerian entities control the lifting of many oil 
<br>cargoes and there are some "very interesting" people lifting oil. 
<br>Oil buyers would pay NNPC GMD Yar'Adua, Chief Economic Advisor Yakubu 
<br>and the First Lady Turai Yar'Adua large bribes to lift oil. Pickard 
<br>also reported an instance of the Attorney General Aondoakaa allegedly 
<br>soliciting a $20 million bribe to sign a document. The International 
<br>Oil Companies (IOC) are quite concerned about the "very flawed" new 
<br>petroleum sector energy bill. The IOCs will be asking U.S., Dutch, 
<br>and U.K. COMs to convey points on the bill to GON policymakers. 
<br>Pickard agreed that the President's health is a guessing game. She 
<br>said that in her recent meetings with Yar'Auda he seems alert, though 
<br>very drawn in the face, thin, and frail. Her information is that the 
<br>President was not in danger of dying soon, but also was unlikely to 
<br>ever fully recover from his ailments. (Note: see septel on oil/energy 
<br>sector issues for the Ambassador's meeting with the new Minister of 
<br>Petroleum Resources. End Note). END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Shell's regional executive vice president for Africa Ann 
<br>Pickard and government relations representative Peter Francis met 
<br>with the Ambassador on January 27, 2009 in Abuja and provided an 
<br>update on problems in the oil and gas sector. Pickard reported that 
<br>Shell's meeting with Minister of Petroleum Resources Dr. Rilwanu 
<br>Lukman scheduled for earlier that day had been cancelled; the third 
<br>week in a row where key appointments had fallen through, with the 
<br>excuse of being summoned to the Presidential Villa. (Note: Emboffs 
<br>have observed that meetings with ministers and senior staff are 
<br>indeed often cancelled with the explanation that they have been 
<br>summoned to the Presidential Villa, even when the President is out of 
<br>town. End note). Econ Counselor and Econoff (notetaker) also 
<br>attended the discussion.

<br>
<br>¶3. (C) The Ambassador took the opportunity to share with Pickard that 
<br>the Mission was in the midst of completing its Strategic Plan and 
<br>asked Pickard where she thought Nigeria was headed. Pickard said that 
<br>things were going from bad to worse, especially in terms of security. 
<br>She said that Nigeria now had the highest negative rating for 
<br>maritime security, creating problems for Shell in hiring oil tankers 
<br>to load; tankers will work only under highly selective conditions. 
<br>She also noted that late on the evening of Saturday January 17, 
<br>Nigerian militants attacked and boarded two vessels at a Shell crude 
<br>oil loading platform in Bonny and took eight crew members hostage. 
<br>Standard procedure on the tanker was followed: the ship went into 
<br>immediate lock down; there were no injuries or fatalities from the 
<br>boarding. The eight Nigerian crew members who were taken hostage were 
<br>later released. The pirates who went through the sections of the 
<br>boat to which they were able to gain access, smashing and stealing 
<br>computers, electronics, and personal items of the crew members. The 
<br>second vessel was a tug boat towing a supply vessel from Bonny to 
<br>Calabar. Last year there were about 80 incidents of piracy; this 
<br>year already 15 had been tallied, which includes 3 for Shell and 3 
<br>for Exxon. GON officials have told Shell to "hire more security." 
<br>The price of doing business in the oil and gas sector in Nigeria 
<br>continues to climb she concluded. [Note: The International Maritime 
<br>Bureau (IMB), a division of the International Chamber of Commerce - 
<br>www icc-ccs org - reports that the waters off the Gulf of Guinea 
<br>(Nigeria) remain the second worst, with 40 incidents in 2008 to the 
<br>Horn of Africa (Somalia) with 42 recorded incidents. The IMB notes 
<br>that in 2009 the Horn of Africa will be more intense as Spring comes 
<br>due to the large number of foreign warships in the region on active 
<br>patrol to ensure the safety and security of vessels. The same 
<br>increased security is not expected for Nigeria in 2009. End Note]

<br>ABUJA 00000259 002 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) The Ambassador asked what Shell's thoughts were on any 
<br>potential for a coup. Pickard answered that there is little 
<br>intellectual capital to plan and execute a coup and Shell sees little 
<br>potential for one. Pickard then went on to say that corruption in 
<br>the oil sector was worsening by the day. The Ambassador asked for a 
<br>few examples. Pickard said that Nigerian entities control the 
<br>lifting of many oil cargoes and there are some "very interesting" 
<br>people lifting oil (People, she said that were not even in the 
<br>industry). As an example she said that oil buyers would pay Nigerian 
<br>National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) General Managing Director 
<br>Yar'Adua, (Note: not related to President Yar'Adua. End Note) Chief 
<br>Economic Advisor Yakubu, and the First Lady Turai Yar'Adua large 
<br>bribes, millions of dollars per tanker, to lift oil. The IOCs 
<br>control the liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cargos, so GON actors do 
<br>not have the same opportunity for illicit gain. Pickard also said a 
<br>former associate of hers (protect) had told her he had been present 
<br>when Attorney General Aondoakaa had told a visitor that he would sign 
<br>a document only if the visitor paid $2 million immediately and 
<br>another $18 million the next day. 
<br>
<br>- - - - - - - 
<br>VERY BAD BILL 
<br>- - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Pickard reported that Shell, Exxon-Mobil and Chevron all have 
<br>big license review disputes with the GON. Shell has taken its 
<br>dispute to court and the court is supporting Shell's position. 
<br>According to her, Shell is stepping back for the moment, however, to 
<br>see how the other two majors negotiation fair, but is not taking its 
<br>case out of court yet. The IOCs are quite concerned about the "very 
<br>flawed" new petroleum sector energy bill. The bill is silent on what 
<br>fiscal regimes would be applied. Shell says that the bill could 
<br>reduce the corporation's overall value in Nigeria. GON discussions 
<br>around the bill have mentioned the possibility of moving to five-year 
<br>licenses and prohibiting exploring both oil and gas from the same 
<br>source, which would contradict how oil and gas extraction works in 
<br>practice. The bill is silent on joint ventures; it just states that 
<br>NNPC will be incorporated. Pickard said the bill was "likely to sail 
<br>through." The IOCs will be asking U.S., Dutch and U.K. COMs to 
<br>convey points on the bill to GON policymakers. (Note: Pickard 
<br>mentioned that the IOCs will not share company information directly; 
<br>they will hire consultants, like McKinsey, to produce common themes 
<br>so the messages from the IOCs to be shared with the relevant 
<br>Ambassadors are clear and consistent. End note). Pickard lamented 
<br>that the expected cycle of petroleum is at least five years for the 
<br>first oil to flow, another 10 years of production to begin to break 
<br>even. These numbers change when oil is $40 per barrel instead of $100 
<br>per barrel. Hence, a five year license would not be an incentive for 
<br>investment and development.

<br>GAS ISSUES

<br>
<br>¶6. (C) The Ambassador said that the Mission was looking at 
<br>performance measures for the economy, i.e. the linkage between the 
<br>country's electricity output and gross domestic product (GDP). The 
<br>Ambassador shared that the Mission feels strongly that gas for 
<br>feedstock is the key to Nigeria's power production, which is only 
<br>about 2,800 average megawatts for a country of 140 million people. 
<br>Pickard agreed and added that the U.S. got it wrong on its domestic 
<br>natural gas policies, which it took over 20 years to sort out. So it 
<br>is not surprising that Nigeria has it wrong at this point. She said 
<br>there is not adequate infrastructure for gas. Gathering plants and 
<br>pipelines to carry the product to the power plants still have to be 
<br>financed and built. The Nigeria Independent Power Projects (NIPP) 
<br>were located where there is no gas and no infrastructure. In 
<br>addition, the international oil companies were coerced into building 
<br>a power plant each, something they have no expertise in, and they are 
<br>scrambling to deliver gas to these plants.

<br>
<br>¶7. (S/NF) Pickard agreed that the President's health is a guessing 
<br>game. She said that in her recent meetings with Yar'Auda he seems 
<br>alert but drawn in the face and frail. She reported that a Julius 
<br>Berger (protect) contact says that the President was not in danger of 
<br>dying soon but has serious ailments from which he will never fully 
<br>recover. Pickard shared that Berger provides transportation 
<br>including planes for the President and has reportedly flown in 
<br>doctors and technicians to attend the President (reftel). She said, 
<br>for instance, that her Berger contact confided that they flew the 
<br>President from Germany to Saudi in September 2008. Additionally, the 
<br>Berger contact thought the President would not return to the Villa 
<br>
<br>ABUJA 00000259 003 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>offices, as they were moving the President's personal things out of 
<br>the Villa. (Note: What we think this means is that Yar'Adua is 
<br>spending most of his time in the presidential residence and not in 
<br>the Villa offices. End Note).

<br>HOPES THAT OIL NATIONALISM CAN BE TEMPERED 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) The Ambassador asked how comfortable Shell was with the new 
<br>appointment of Dr. Rilwanu Lukman as Minister of Petroleum Resources, 
<br>and the appointment of Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo as the new NNPC GMD. 
<br>Pickard sees the nationalism card cooling with the removal of former 
<br>NNPC GMD Yar'Adua, given that new Minister of Petroleum Lukman is 
<br>more "pragmatic" and will hold sway over deputy Minister Ajumogobia. 
<br>(Note: Ajumogobia's technical assistant told EconOff in a meeting on 
<br>January 14, 2009 that the State Minister was focusing on Gas, since 
<br>before the mass cabinet change he was State Minster of Petroleum, 
<br>with a separate State Minster for Gas.) End Note. She said she was 
<br>also okay with NNPC chief Barkindo. She has worked with Barkindo 
<br>several times over the past few decades, especially when they were 
<br>both working climate change. She said Barkindo led Nigeria's 
<br>technical delegation to climate change negotiations that produced the 
<br>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)and the 
<br>Kyoto protocol to UNFCCC during while he served on its Bureau at 
<br>various times. She indicated that although his undergraduate studies 
<br>were in political science, he obtained his MBA from Southeastern 
<br>University in Washington DC and did postgraduate work in petroleum 
<br>economics and management at Oxford University. Although she also said 
<br>terms like nationalistic and Chavez she however said that she thought 
<br>he could be steered in the right direction on the petroleum sector.

<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Although Pickard clearly seems frustrated with the way things 
<br>are going in the maritime security, oil sector legislation, and 
<br>corruption which affects Shell's bottom line, it was useful to hear 
<br>that she has hopes for the new Petroleum Minister and NNPC chief. 
<br>Septel on the Ambassador's meeting with new Petroleum Minister Lukman 
<br>will address many of these same issues.
