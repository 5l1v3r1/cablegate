<br>Classified By: Anne W. Patterson for reasons 1.4 (b) (d) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) Summary: The Pakistani military is continuing its 
<br>counterinsurgency efforts along the main corridors of South 
<br>Waziristan and the northern and central FATA with low level 
<br>search and clear operations. Frontier Corps operations in 
<br>Bajaur remain on hold, awaiting additional forces. 
<br>Meanwhile, humanitarian assistance (food and non-food items) 
<br>is reaching both the approximately 12,000 families displaced 
<br>from Orakzai and the approximately 38,000 families displaced 
<br>from South Waziristan. Of the displaced, only a few, perhaps 
<br>one hundred families, are in a camp. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>SOUTH WAZIRISTAN: CLEARING OPERATIONS CONTINUE 
<br>--------------------------------------------- - 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) In South Waziristan, units assigned to the 11th 
<br>Corps continue to conduct small-scale clearing operations on 
<br>major and secondary line of communication (LOCs) and in 
<br>built-up areas. Units of the 7th Division hold Makin and 
<br>Razmak on the northern axis; the 9th Division holds the 
<br>southwest axis from Wana while the 14th Division continues to 
<br>secure the LOC to Jandola in the south east. All division 
<br>continue to conduct search and clear operations. We do not 
<br>expect any major new operations in South Waziristan for the 
<br>moment. There has been talk of an additional push, but 
<br>Pakistani military contacts have indicated to us that troop 
<br>rotations and resupply requirements mean any additional 
<br>effort would not happen before March. 
<br>
<br>BAJAUR: WAITING FOR A MAJOR OFFENSIVE 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) In Bajaur Agency, Pakistan Army troops remain 
<br>deployed along the Charmung and Watalai Valley, with 
<br>additional checkpoints in place near Khar to screen vehicles 
<br>entering and leaving the Watalai Valley -- an indication of 
<br>possible preparations for a future operation. U.S. provided 
<br>Intelligence targets of interest in Bajaur Agency's Mamund 
<br>Valley and provide coordinates for artillery strikes and 
<br>future Pakistan Air Force air strikes. It is likely these 
<br>operations will continue through the end of January. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) Pakistan Military and Frontier Corps forces 
<br>appear to be delaying the start of a planned three-week 
<br>offensive in the Mamund Valley, originally scheduled to start 
<br>on January 6, because of a request for two additional Army 
<br>battalions for clearing operations. The additional forces 
<br>are the 14th Punjab Battalion (from Kwazakhela, Swat, the 
<br>12th Northern Light Infantry Battalion (from Sialkot, Punjab) 
<br>and the 4th Commando Battalion and Karrar Company of the 
<br>Special Services Group battalion (the Pakistan Army's Special 
<br>Forces). In addition, the 2nd Wing of the Tocho Scouts 
<br>(currently in Bajaur) may be relieved by a wing of the 
<br>Chitral Scouts, who just completed FCTC training at Warsak. 
<br>
<br>INCREASED CHECKPOINTS 
<br>--------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) Access to Orakzai Agency from the surrounding four 
<br>agencies and districts has been blocked by security forces, 
<br>and artillery and armor have moved to the Khyber and Kurram 
<br>borders with Orakzai. This coupled with the repositioning of 
<br>artillery and armor assets in Kurram and Khyber suggests 
<br>additional operations are imminent against TTP insurgents in 
<br>western Orakzai or Tariq Afridi militants in the Darra Adam 
<br>Khel region of NWFP. 
<br>
<br>INFRASTRUCTURE RECONSTRUCTION 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br>
<br>
<br>ISLAMABAD 00000175 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>¶6. (U) On December 31, 2009, USAID signed and Implementation 
<br>Letter (IL) with the FATA Secretariat for the rehabilitation 
<br>and reconstruction of water, road and energy infrastructure 
<br>in South Waziristan. USAID will 
<br>reimburse the FATA Secretariat for work completed according 
<br>to pre-agreed costs and specifications. The GOP is currently 
<br>preparing the specifications and cost estimates for the 
<br>projects, with an initial emphasis on a major road between 
<br>Tank and Makeen. Once the design and cost estimate has been 
<br>completed and approved, USAID will advance the FATA 
<br>Secretariat 15 percent of the cost to cover mobilization 
<br>expenses, with additional funding to be disbursed after the 
<br>work is completed. The FATA Secretariat is contracting the 
<br>Frontier Works Organization (FWO) to implement the road 
<br>projects. In a January 14 meeting with USAID, FWO confirmed 
<br>that it had mobilized a team in South Waziristan to complete 
<br>the design and cost estimates. 
<br>
<br>ASSISTANCE TO ORAKZAI AND SWA DISPLACED 
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) Humanitarian assistance - food and non-food items 
<br>(NFI) - is reaching both the approximately 12,000 families 
<br>displaced from Orakzai and the approximately 38,000 families 
<br>displaced from South Waziristan. Of the Orakzai displaced, 
<br>the 8,000 families in Kohat have received NFI through UNHCR, 
<br>and the rest, who are in Hangu, are supported by ICRC. Only 
<br>a very few -- perhaps one hundred families -- are in a camp. 
<br>While the Orakzai displaced do not receive cash payments from 
<br>the Government of Pakistan, they are supported with food from 
<br>the World Food Program (WFP). 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Those registered displaced (members of the Mehsud 
<br>tribe) from South Waziristan are primarily in DI Khan and 
<br>Tank where they have received ample non-food items from 
<br>UNHCR. They receive a one-month food distribution from WFP 
<br>upon registration and then are entitled to government 
<br>payments of PKR 5,000 (about $60) a month. Those who do not 
<br>yet have activated government cash cards continue to receive 
<br>WFP food. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) For military and strategic purposes, the GOP does not 
<br>recognize members of the neighboring Bhittani tribe as 
<br>conflict-displaced IDPs and hence has not designated them as 
<br>eligible for government payments. Recently, however, UNHCR 
<br>was pleased to be able to win government permission to 
<br>register the Bhittani displaced unofficially and to see that 
<br>they receive humanitarian assistance. A total of some 2,000 
<br>Bhittani families are being registered in DI Khan and Tank, 
<br>and when this registration is completed in the next few days, 
<br>this group will benefit from NFI and food distributions. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (SBU) Even prior to the security forces' blocking of 
<br>access to Orakzai Agency, humanitarian actors have not been 
<br>able to provide assistance within Orakzai or South 
<br>Waziristan. Humanitarian organizations have begun planning, 
<br>however, for possible assistance upon the eventual return of 
<br>IDPs to areas of displacement. They have received some 
<br>indications from the military to expect the beginning of this 
<br>return in March. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (S/NF) Comment: As we have previously noted, the Army's 
<br>South Waziristan campaign has significantly eroded the TTP's 
<br>command and control, but has not destroyed the TTP network, 
<br>whose fighters melted away in South Waziristan or fled to 
<br>other FATA agencies, rather than put up stiff resistance. 
<br>The Army still faces a long road ahead in rooting out the TTP 
<br>in South Waziristan and pursuing TTP elements elsewhere in 
<br>the FATA.
