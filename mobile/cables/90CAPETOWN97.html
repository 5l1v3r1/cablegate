<br>SUMMARY 
<br>-------- 
<br>¶2.  ATTORNEY ESSA MOOSA WHO SPOKE WITH HIM LAST WEEK, 
<br>SAYS MANDELA FULLY EXPECTS THAT ON FEBRUARY 2 DE KLERK 
<br>WILL ANNOUNCE THE UNBANNING OF THE ANC, PAC AND OTHER 
<br>ORGANIZATIONS, THE LIFTING OF THE STATE OF EMERGENCY, 
<br>THE RETURN OF POLITICAL EXILES TO SOUTH AFRICA, AND THE

<br> 
<br>RELEASE OF SEVERAL POLITICAL PRISONERS INCLUDING MANDELA 
<br>HIMSELF.  IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ANNOUNCEMENTS WOULD COME 
<br>SWIFTLY AFTER DE KLERK'S SPEECH AT THE OPENING OF 
<br>PARLIAMENT. 
<br>- 
<br>¶3.  THE SAG IS CONCERNED OVER ANC RELATIONS WITH THE SACP 
<br>AND OVER THE WORKING DEFINITION OF "ONE MAN ONE VOTE," 
<br>AMONG OTHER "WHITE FEARS" ISSUES.  MANDELA HAS PASSED 
<br>DE KLERK'S "PROPOSALS" ON THESE TOPICS TO THE ANC. 
<br>THE ORGANIZATION'S ANNOUNCEMENT THAT IT IS WILLING TO 
<br>NEGOTIATE EVEN WHILE APARTHEID LAWS REMAIN IN PLACE MAY 
<br>BE PART OF THE ANC'S REPLY TO THE SAG. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  TENSIONS IN THE COMMUNITY HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY 
<br>REDUCED BY THE SAG'S TACTIC OF OPENING DIALOGUE AND A 
<br>COMMITMENT SHARED BY THE MDM TO REDUCE CONFRONTATIONS. 
<br>WHILE MAINLY OF BENEFIT TO THE SAG, THIS PERIOD OF CALM 
<br>COULD ALSO FAVOR THE ANC'S NEW STRATEGY OF PRAGMATISM. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  RAISING THE PENDING VISIT OF JESSE JACKSON, MOOSA 
<br>EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT IT WOULD BE BAD FOR THE STRUGGLE 
<br>IF JACKSON ADVOCATED LIFTING SANCTIONS UPON HIS RETURN TO 
<br>THE US.  END SUMMARY. 
<br>- 
<br>¶6.  IN A HALF HOUR CONVERSATION WITH POLECONOFF. ESSA 
<br>MOOSA. THE WESTERN CAPE UDF'S LAWYER AND ONE OF THE 
<br>ATTORNEYS WHO MET WITH MANDELA LAST WEEK, MADE THE F0LLOW- 
<br>ING REMARKS: 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
<br>MANDELA RELEASE WILL BE ANNOUNCED FEBRUARY 2 IN PARLIAMENT 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
<br>¶7.  MANDELA MADE IT QUITE CLEAR THAT HE FULLY EXPECTS

<br> 
<br>PRESIDENT FW DE KLERK TO MAKE SEVERAL MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENTS 
<br>IN HIS FEBRUARY 2 SPEECH AT THE OPENING OF PARLIAMENT. 
<br>DE KLERK WILL ANNOUNCE: 
<br> 
<br>-- THE UNBANNING OF THE ANC, PAC AND OTHER POLITICAL 
<br>-  ORGANIZATIONS; 
<br> 
<br>-- THE END OF THE STATE OF EMERGENCY; 
<br> 
<br>-- THE RETURN OF POLITICAL EXILES TO SOUTH AFRICA; 
<br> 
<br>-- THE RELEASE OF A NUMBER OF POLITICAL PRISONERS, 
<br>-  INCLUDING NELSON MANDELA. 
<br>- 
<br>¶8.  THESE ANNOUNCEMENTS WILL NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT ALL 
<br>THE ITEMS LISTED WILL TAKE EFFECT AS OF THE TIME OF THE 
<br>SPEECH.  BUT FIRM PLANS AND A COMMITMENT TO CARRY THEM OUT 
<br>SWIFTLY WILL BE PART OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>WHERE WILL MANDELA BE RELEASED? 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>¶9.  MOOSA SIDESTEPPED A QUESTION ABOUT WHERE MANDELA'S 
<br>HOME BASE WOULD BE UPON HIS RELEASE.  HE ONLY REMARKED 
<br>THAT MANDELA CAN TELL THE SAG WHERE HE WANTS TO BE 
<br>RELEASED AND WHERE HIS FIRST PUBLIC APPEARANCE WOULD THUS 
<br>TAKE PLACE.  SENTIMENTALLY, SAID MOOSA, PAARL (WHERE 
<br>MANDELA IS NOW IN PRISON) SEEMED TO APPEAL TO MANDELA. 
<br>(COMMENT:  BUT POLITICALLY AND PRACTICALLY THIS MAKES 
<br>LITTLE SENSE.  JOHANNESBURG SEEMS BY FAR THE MOST 
<br>SUITABLE VENUE. END COMMENT.)

<br>SUBJECT:  ESSA MOOSA TALKS ABOUT MANDELA AND OTHER TOPICS 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br>DE KLERK-ANC COMMUNICATION THROUGH MANDELA 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  WHEN HE MET SEVERAL WEEKS AGO WITH MANDELA, DE KLERK 
<br>PROVIDED A SET OF PROPOSALS AND ASKED FOR THE ANC'S 
<br>RESPONSE.  MANDELA HAS NOT DISCUSSED THOSE PROPOSALS 
<br>IN ANY DETAIL WITH PEOPLE HERE (AT LEAST HE DID NOT DO SO 
<br>WITH THE LAWYERS' GROUP OF WHICH MOOSA WAS A MEMBER) BUT 
<br>HE DID TRANSMIT THEM TO ALFRED NZO AND THABO MBEKI. 
<br>MOOSA BELIEVES (PIECING TOGETHER STRAY REMARKS WHERE AND 
<br>THERE) THAT THE PROPOSALS RELATED PRINCIPALLY TO THE NEED 
<br>TO ALLAY WHITE FEARS.  SPECIFICALLY, HE THINKS ONE ISSUE 
<br>WAS THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE ANC TO THE SACP (SOUTH AFRICAN 
<br>COMMUNIST PARTY) AND ANOTHER WAS THE DEFINITION OF ONE MAN 
<br>ONE VOTE. 
<br> 
<br>¶11.  ASIDE FROM BEING AN EFFORT TO SEIZE THE MORAL HIGH 
<br>GROUND BY PUBLICLY DEMONSTRATING FLEXIBILITY, THE ANC'S 
<br>RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT THAT IT IS PREPARED TO NEGOTIATE 
<br>EVEN WHILE APARTHEID LAWS LIKE THE GROUP AREAS ACT REMAIN 
<br>IN PLACE MAY BE PART OF THE ORGANIZATION'S REPLY TO DE 
<br>KLERK. 
<br> 
<br>¶12.  MOOSA UNDERSTANDS MANDELA TO HAVE WORKED OUT A 
<br>GAME PLAN FOR "NEXT STEPS" IN A NEGOTIATION WITH DE KLERK 
<br>SO AS TO ENSURE THAT HE IS NOT RELEASED FROM PRISON 
<br>INTO A VACUUM. 
<br> 
<br>¶13.  MANDELA HAS TOLD VARIOUS VISITORS THAT HE HAS A GOOD 
<br>OPINION OF DE KLERK AS A SINCERE INDIVIDUAL EVEN THOUGH 
<br>HE REGARDS HIM AS STILL THE LEADER OF THE NATIONAL PARTY 
<br>AND NOT MORE THAN THAT. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------- 
<br>COMMITMENT ON SAG AND MDM SIDE TO REDUCE CONFRONTATION 
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------- 
<br> 
<br>¶14.  MOOSA AGREED THAT THE ATMOSPHERE IS MUCH LESS TENSE 
<br>THAN EVEN SIX MONTHS AGO.  FOR EXAMPLE, LAST YEAR THE 
<br>RETURN TO SCHOOL RESULTED IN THE USUAL ACCUSATIONS AND 
<br>PHYSICAL CONFRONTATIONS BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF 
<br>EDUCATION AND TRAINING (DET), AIDED BY THE POLICE, 
<br>AND STUDENTS SUPPORTED BY PARENTS, TEACHERS AND THE MDM. 
<br>THIS YEAR THERE IS AN EVEN WORSE CRISIS DUE TO LACK OF 
<br>SPACE IN BLACK SCHOOLS AND THE FAILURE OF OVER 100,000 
<br>STUDENTS TO PASS THEIR "MATRIC EXAMS." YET THERE IS A NEW 
<br>SPIRIT OF DIALOGUE AT THE DET AND ACTIVISTS ARE 
<br>THEREFORE ABLE TO CHANNEL STUDENT FRUSTRATIONS IN A CON- 
<br>STRUCTIVE MANNER. 
<br> 
<br>¶15.  THE SAG'S NEW "TACTIC" OF ALLOWING DISSENT AND 
<br>ENGAGING IN DIALOGUE INSTEAD OF STONEWALLING "IS WORKING 
<br>FOR THEM," MOOSA SAID.  HE ACKNOWLEDGED, HOWEVER, THAT IT 
<br>COULD ALSO, IF DEALT WITH POSITIVELY, WORK FOR THE MDM 
<br>AND ANC.  THOUGH AN ABSENCE OF DIRECT CONFRONTATION IS 
<br>"DEMOBILIZING FOR THE MASSES," FEWER RAW NERVES AMONG 
<br>ACTIVISTS COULD MAKE THEM MORE AMENABLE TO THE ANC'S 
<br>INCREASINGLY PRAGMATIC STRATEGY FOR DEALING WITH THE SAG. 
<br>THAT STRATEGY, MOOSA SAID, IS NOT UNDERSTOOD BY MANY 
<br>ACTIVISTS, ESPECIALLY YOUTH, WHO FEAR A SELL-OUT OF THEIR 
<br>CAUSE.  THERE REMAINS A LOT TO DO TO EXPLAIN THE VIRTUES 
<br>OF FLEXIBILITY TO THEM. 
<br> 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>PAC AND BC -- A THORN IN THE SIDE 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶16.  MOOSA DESCRIBED THE CONFERENCE ON A DEMOCRATIC 
<br>FUTURE AS "NOT A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE IN COOPERATION." 
<br>HE OPINED THAT THE PAC AND BC COULD TURN OUT TO BE A 
<br>REAL PROBLEM.  HE EXPECTS THEM TO REMAIN ALOOF, SNIPING 
<br>AT THE ANC'S POSITIONS FROM THE SIDELINES AND STIRRING 
<br>UP YOUNG PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR. 
<br> 
<br>---------------------- 
<br>JESSE JACKSON VISIT 
<br>---------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶17.  MOOSA INQUIRED ABOUT THE DATES FOR JESSE JACKSON'S 
<br>VISIT AND EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT JACKSON HAD MET WITH 
<br>THE PRESS AT SOUTH AFRICAN AMBASSADOR KOORNHOF'S 
<br>RESIDENCE.  MOOSA FEARED THAT THE SAG WAS GOING TOO GOOD 
<br>A JOB OF CULTIVATING JACKSON AND THAT HE MIGHT RETURN 
<br>TO THE US AND ANNOUNCE THAT SANCTIONS SHOULD BE LIFTED. 
<br>MOOSA APPEARED TO HAVE GREATER CONFIDENCE IN KOORNHOF'S 
<br>PERSUASIVE ABILITY THAN IN THAT OF THE SACC LEADERSHIP 
<br>WHICH IS HOSTING THE JACKSON VISIT.
