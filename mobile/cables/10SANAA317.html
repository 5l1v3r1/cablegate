<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Stephen Seche for reasons 1.4(b) and (d).
<br>
<br>This is an action request: see paragraph 12.
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) Summary: Since the start of 2010, Post has seen a
<br>dramatic increase in the number of Amcits arrested. Over 80
<br>percent of these cases (REF A-E) have had a nexus to
<br>terrorism and national security issues that have required
<br>substantial involvement from RSO and LEGATT. This comes as
<br>the Consular Section is attempting to alleviate its six-month
<br>backlog in upcoming CRBA appointments. Post requests TDY
<br>personnel to assist with the anticipated staffing gaps in
<br>Consular from April to September and renews its call to
<br>increase FSO staffing (REF F) to address the sharply
<br>increased workload. End Summary.
<br>
<br>Arrests of Americans Up, New ROYG Procedures
<br>--------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) Post has noted a dramatic increase in arrests of
<br>Americans in Yemen since the attempted Christmas Day bombing
<br>of Northwest 253. In the last seven weeks, seven Amcits were
<br>arrested for national security concerns and violations of
<br>immigration laws (Ref A-E), compared to only six in the
<br>entire four months prior. Six of these cases have suspected
<br>links to terrorism that have required significant
<br>coordination with LEGATT and RSO. Comment: This upsurge in
<br>arrests is the result of more scrupulous ROYG focus on visa
<br>overstay cases due to increased international attention to
<br>terrorism in Yemen. End Comment.
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) Previously, a visa overstay would present himself
<br>at the immigration authority, pay his fines, and obtain an
<br>exit visa.  Recently, however, overstays have been detained
<br>and have required post intervention in securing their exit
<br>from Yemen. Four of the arrestees were 'abducted' by the
<br>Political Security Organization (PSO) or National Security
<br>Bureau (NSB) and were held for between 3-10 days before post
<br>was given official notice of their whereabouts. Note: In the
<br>past two years, the Muslim convert community of Amcits living
<br>in Yemen ) who make up the majority of overstays - has been
<br>increasingly linked to extremist activities. End Note. In one
<br>case, Post has still not received official word of the arrest
<br>and is unable to inform the family in the US, who still
<br>believes the individual has been kidnapped. The issue of
<br>timely notification of arrests was recently raised by post's
<br>DCM with the Yemeni Chief of Protocol.
<br>
<br>Direct Namecheck Hits Increasing
<br>--------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) In addition to the spike in arrest cases, post
<br>routinely sees cases of national security interest in the
<br>course of its daily visa and American citizen services (ACS)
<br>operations. On average, post has 3-5 cases per week that
<br>require LEGATT and RSO attention. The processing time
<br>required to clear these hits and allow time for additional
<br>interviews is increasingly straining our ability to provide
<br>routine services in a timely fashion. Comment: Post had
<br>reduced appointment wait time for first-time CRBA
<br>applications from six months to three months. We will not be
<br>able to continue such high appointment numbers given the
<br>recent increase in arrest cases and our current staffing
<br>levels.  End Comment.
<br>
<br>Status of Arrestees
<br>-------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) Post is currently processing five arrest cases,
<br>
<br>most of which have begun as welfare and whereabouts requests,
<br>or visa overstays. A sixth, who was not a national security
<br>or terrorist case, was recently released.  All five that
<br>remain have had strong links to terrorism or national
<br>security concerns. The following is an update on these cases.
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) XXXXXXXXXXXX (REF A) was being
<br>held at the Passport Authority pending further investigation
<br>into both his visa overstay and possible links to terrorism.
<br>ROYG previously attempted to deport XXXXXXXXXXXX. He was denied
<br>boarding, however, due to his presence on the no fly list
<br>(NFL). Post had requested guidance from CA on this matter
<br>(REF G), as per applicable FAM NFL guidance. Post,s A/RSO-I
<br>received a call from Consulate Istanbul,s A/RSO-I (REF H)
<br>that XXXXXXXXXXXX arrived in Istanbul on February 16, but was denied
<br>onward travel to the U.S due to his NFL status. Post later
<br>received notice that XXXXXXXXXXXX is scheduled to board Turkish
<br>Airlines flight TK1236 to Sanaa on February 17 (REF I). Note:
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX no longer has a valid Yemeni visa and airport visas are
<br>no longer available (REF J). End Note.
<br>
<br>¶7. (S/NF) XXXXXXXXXXXX (REF B) is being held at the
<br>PSO prison.  He is currently still under investigation by the
<br>PSO, which plans to deport him. No date for his release has
<br>been set. FBI and DS plan to meet him in the US upon his
<br>return.
<br>
<br>¶8. (S/NF) XXXXXXXXXXXX (REF C) is being held by the
<br>Passport Authority and is awaiting deportation.  Currently,
<br>ROYG authorities are waiting for Mr. XXXXXXXXXXXX to secure an
<br>itinerary and tickets to the US before his release.
<br>
<br>¶9. (S/NF) XXXXXXXXXXXX (Ref D) is also being held at
<br>the PSO prison.  He is currently being investigated for his
<br>links to terrorism.  The ROYG has not given any information
<br>regarding possible charges.
<br>
<br>¶10. (S/NF) XXXXXXXXXXXX (Ref E) is currently being held at
<br>the Immigration Authority prison pending possible
<br>deportation. It is currently unclear if Mr. XXXXXXXXXXXX will be
<br>able to pay his overstay fines and obtain a standard exit
<br>visa to return to the US or if he will be deported.
<br>
<br>COMMENT
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶11. (SBU) Post currently has five full-time officers assigned
<br>to the consular section and one part-time officer. Prison
<br>visits must occur during morning hours pulling officers away
<br>from visa and ACS cases.  This increase in workload has
<br>pushed our already strained operation beyond capacity and has
<br>hampered our ability to work through existing backlogs in ACS
<br>and IV. In REF F and through Diplomacy 3.0, post requested at
<br>least one additional ACS officer based on workload and
<br>staffing in FY09.  Post's workload in IV has increased by
<br>5,722 cases or over 2.5 times from FY08 to FY09.
<br>Additionally, post's NIV workload increased by 918
<br>adjudications, up nearly a third from FY08 to FY09. End
<br>Comment.
<br>
<br>ACTION REQUEST
<br>--------------
<br>
<br>¶12. (SBU) Post renews its call for a full-time FS-03 ACS
<br>officer and FS-04 Vice Consul, and requests TDY support to
<br>cover officer leave and the anticipated staffing gap from
<br>April through September. In addition, post requests
<br>experienced Arabic-speaking LE Staff and officer TDY support
<br>as soon as possible to assist in working through backlogs in
<br>ACS and IV. Post fully expects that the trends of increasing
<br>arrests and direct hit cases will continue and looks forward
<br>to a positive and expeditious response to this request.
