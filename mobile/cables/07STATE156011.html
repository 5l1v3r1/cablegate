<br>SUBJECT: PDAS KELLY CALLS IN BOLIVIAN AMBASSADOR GUZMAN 
<br>
<br>REF: LA PAZ 2974 
<br>
<br>Classified By: PDAS Craig Kelly, reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
<br>
<br>SUMMARY 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) PDAS Craig Kelly called in Bolivian Ambassador Gustavo 
<br>Guzman November 9 to express USG dissatisfaction about the 
<br>Bolivian Government's (GOB) repeated verbal attacks against 
<br>the USG. PDAS Kelly warned Guzman that GOB actions could 
<br>negatively impact Bolivia's requests for trade preferences 
<br>and development assistance. Note: Department hopes EU 
<br>members resident in La Paz will support our appeal for calmer 
<br>rhetoric; details to follow via septel. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>HELP US HELP YOU: END THE ATTACKS 
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) PDAS Kelly told Ambassador Guzman (who was accompanied 
<br>by Bolivian DCM Raul Barrios, First Secretary Davalos, and 
<br>First Secretary Ayllon) that the USG wanted an open and 
<br>positive relationship with Bolivia and was committed to 
<br>helping Bolivia address poverty and counternarcotics 
<br>challenges; however, the tone and frequency of the GOB,s 
<br>political rhetoric and attacks against the USG caused us 
<br>serious concern. Kelly said the baseless attacks against 
<br>USAID and allegations of a USG conspiracy against the GOB 
<br>were counterproductive and made it difficult to sustain 
<br>positive will. Actions have consequences, Kelly admonished, 
<br>and the GOB,s actions threatened MCC, ATPA, and future AID 
<br>programs. Kelly specifically noted MCC President 
<br>Danilovich,s and other high level officials, negative 
<br>reaction to the GOB,s attacks against the USG. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Kelly also said that the personal attacks against 
<br>Ambassador Goldberg, who enjoys an excellent reputation 
<br>throughout the USG, must stop immediately. Recent 
<br>accusations that Ambassador Goldberg was working with 
<br>Colombian paramilitaries were not only groundless and 
<br>offensive but also made light of the USG's support for the 
<br>Government of Colombia's success in reining in illegal armed 
<br>groups and our overall policy against narcoterrorism. 
<br>Department hopes EU members resident in La Paz will support 
<br>our appeal for calmer rhetoric; details to follow via septel. 
<br>
<br>
<br>DON'T PICK ON EVO, HE'S JUST A COCALERO 
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Ambassador Guzman assured PDAS Kelly that he would 
<br>convey USG concerns to President Morales via the MFA and 
<br>expressed his commitment to overcoming these challenges. He 
<br>attempted to explain away Morales, behavior, recalling 
<br>Bolivia's conflictive history, Morales, indigenous 
<br>background and cocalero base of support, and the Bolivian 
<br>President's belief that Bolivian elites and one former USG 
<br>ambassador in particular had worked actively to undermine 
<br>him. Guzman said that Morales, rhetoric played to his 
<br>cocalero constituency which viewed him as their champion 
<br>against imperialism. His campaign for social inclusion 
<br>represented an important democratic movement not only for 
<br>Bolivia, Guzman stressed, but for all of Latin America -- 
<br>particularly the heretofore excluded indigenous population. 
<br>PDAS Kelly interjected that the USG shared Morales, vision 
<br>for eradicating poverty and social inclusion; however, it was 
<br>offensive and unacceptable to seek to portray the U.S., which 
<br>was an important ally of Bolivia's in this regard, as 
<br>imperialist. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Guzman said his objective was to build trust and 
<br>confidence between the U.S. and Bolivia and agreed that 
<br>bilateral disagreements should be resolved privately through 
<br>diplomatic channels, not in the press. He lamented the lack 
<br>of coordination between Bolivia's MFA and office of the 
<br>Presidency, and said that FM Choquehuanca continued to 
<br>promote a one-on-one breakfast for Morales and Ambassador 
<br>Goldberg to help resolve outstanding differences and put the 
<br>bilateral relationship on a more solid footing. 
<br>
<br>GOB RADAR: TRADE, DRUGS, AND THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY 
<br>
<br>STATE 00156011 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
<br>¶6. (C) Guzman said that like Peru and Colombia, Bolivia 
<br>sought an open commercial relationship with the U.S.; to that 
<br>end, Minister of Economic Development Cecilia Sosa was 
<br>planning to visit Washington to lobby for an extension of 
<br>Bolivia's ATPA benefits and would request appropriate 
<br>appointments in the Department. Regarding pending removal 
<br>proceedings for Bolivian drug trafficker Arce Gomez, Guzman 
<br>reiterated his request that the Department support efforts to 
<br>prevent Arce Gomez from being deported to a third country 
<br>instead of Bolivia when he completed his jail sentence. 
<br>Kelly said this was a DHS matter and promised the Office of 
<br>Andean affairs would continue to facilitate the Bolivian 
<br>embassy's contacts with the appropriate USG officials. In 
<br>closing, Guzman offered his thoughts on Bolivia's troubled 
<br>Constituent Assembly, noting that its probable demise would 
<br>represent a major failure for the opposition as well as the 
<br>GOB. He predicted that if the Constituent Assembly did not 
<br>succeed, Morales would likely put the issues under 
<br>consideration directly to the people in a referendum.
