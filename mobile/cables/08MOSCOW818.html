<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: As candidate Medvedev transitions into
<br>"President-elect" Medvedev, commentators have begun to speak
<br>with increasing frequency about political support for a
<br>reform agenda, not only the expected backing from the
<br>"liberal" economic elite, but also more broadly amongst
<br>Russia's business leaders; federal and regional leaders; and
<br>even among certain strata of society. While none would
<br>describe this support as a mandate for change, Medvedev
<br>appeared to be reaching out to this latent base in his
<br>February 15 Krasnoyarsk speech and during his "seminar" on
<br>the economy last week with business and financial experts.
<br>Admittedly, Russia's political experts acknowledge that
<br>Medvedev's core values are not known, and even less is
<br>understood about how the Medvedev - Putin "tandemocracy" will
<br>function, some believe that the prospects for a new "thaw"
<br>are greater than they have been for years -- if Medvedev
<br>chooses to take the reform path. Other observers, while
<br>agreeing that change is necessary, believe that a Medvedev
<br>who has spent 17 years in the shadow of Putin, is not the
<br>person to get that ball rolling. End summary.
<br>
<br>A Return to Reform?
<br>-------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) In recent weeks, we have noted some signs that a
<br>Medvedev presidency could return to the economic reform
<br>agenda that Putin supported during his first years in office.
<br>Economic analysts xxxxx point to the decision not to include
<br>telecommunications on the list of "strategic sectors" as a
<br>first sign of a potential shift away from the policies of
<br>state capitalism. Further, Medvedev has publicly advocated
<br>new policies to streamline the administrative requirements
<br>for the fishing industry, potentially a step toward further
<br>reducing the obstacles to other small businesses across the
<br>country. xxxxx told us that they saw little chance that
<br>Medvedev would tackle administrative reform "off the bat" --
<br>suggesting a more assertive approach to promoting the
<br>innovation economy than Moscow's economic watchers had
<br>expected.
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) Encouraging signs on economic reform, however, do
<br>not necessarily translate into optimism for reform in the
<br>political sphere. Medvedev has long been with Putin and has
<br>given no indication that he is ready to wade into the
<br>difficult waters of political reform. xxxxx identified the challenge of
<br>gaining control over the "coercive" elements of the
<br>government - the FSB, the Investigative Commission under the
<br>Prosecutor, and other organs controlled by Sechin's allies --
<br>stands as problem number one for the new president,
<br>particularly given their influence over the state
<br>corporations and likely opposition to their reform. Actions
<br>to assert his authority over those powerful players may
<br>require Medvedev to look for broader support beyond the elite
<br>in support of his reform agenda.
<br>
<br>Constituencies for Change
<br>-------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Taking a cue from observers who have focused their
<br>hopes for change on differences between Medvedev and Putin,
<br>the BBC Moscow's Konstantin Eggert argued to us that Putin
<br>had successfully fashioned himself into the "people's
<br>president" -- one who enjoyed the support of the man on the
<br>street and was able to convert that image into unassailable
<br>popularity. Medvedev, Eggert thought, was not that sort of
<br>man. His personality, background, and temperament suggest
<br>that he would appeal primarily to Russia's intellectual and
<br>technical elite, and to middle class businessmen. There is
<br>some evidence that this stratum is ready for change and could
<br>provide a constituency for reform, if Medvedev were to pursue
<br>a new strategy. The educated middle classes, according to
<br>Eggert, are irritated by the gap between what they have
<br>accomplished in their lives and the fact that lack of
<br>institutions means they remain at the mercy of bureaucrats,
<br>whether they be the traffic police, ministry officials intent
<br>on shaking them down, or members of the judiciary should
<br>their troubles cause them to end up in court. Eggert thought
<br>that this quietly restive part of the population could be a
<br>potent source of support, but is unlikely on its own to
<br>"stick its neck out" without leadership from the top.
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) A recent Levada Center poll offers some evidence
<br>that the looming succession and prospects for change
<br>entertained in Krasnoyarsk have heightened expectations among
<br>a significant minority. Twenty-three percent of those polled
<br>
<br>expect that Medvedev will undertake liberal economic reforms,
<br>while sixteen percent believe Medvedev will rely on the
<br>middle class for support (only ten percent expected the same
<br>from Putin when he became President). A reduced number
<br>--from 52 percent for Putin to 38 percent-- believed that
<br>Medvedev would rely on the "siloviki" as he proceeded with
<br>his Presidency. A VTsIOM poll, taken in early March, shows
<br>that 54 percent of respondents expected Medvedev to take
<br>Russia on a more "democratic course."
<br>
<br>Dissatisfaction within the Elite
<br>--------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) xxxxx told us that, in addition to Medvedev's
<br>potential constituency in the electorate, there is support
<br>for resuming the gradual economic reforms that Putin had
<br>begun in his first term, but then abandoned in his second.
<br>According to xxxxx, Deputy Prime Minister Kudrin, Sberbank's
<br>German Gref, multi-billionaire Roman Abramovich, and others
<br>had lobbied for Medvedev as successor in the year preceding
<br>Putin's decision. They, and others like Minister of Regional
<br>Development Dmitriy Kozak (although no friend of Medvedev's)
<br>formed a small, but respected and potentially potent core
<br>group for reform within the Administration. xxxxx thought
<br>that Medvedev might bring additional figures with similar
<br>sympathies into his administration.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Conversations since the election suggest that support
<br>for a change of course extends beyond the Kremlin walls.
<br>"xxxxx have
<br>separately suggested to us that quiet discontent is the norm
<br>among many -- even those in the United Russia party -- in the
<br>Duma, but that few are willing to lift their heads above the
<br>pack unless they have reason to believe that prospects for
<br>change are real. xxxxx hoped that the economic problems
<br>would ultimately force Medvedev to change course in order to
<br>salvage his presidency.
<br>
<br>Will Medvedev Meet the Challenge?
<br>---------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) As xxxxx told
<br>us: "Medvedev is the best of all possibilities." xxxxx who
<br>had met with Medvedev twice over the years, described him as
<br>"ready to hear sharp criticism," and "ambitious." xxxxx shared xxxxx
<br>measured optimism about Medvedev who, "wants power," and
<br>would use the corruption campaign he had promised to launch
<br>to make inroads on the "siloviki."
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) xxxxx agreed that concrete steps would be necessary
<br>in order to overcome the pervasive "cynicism" and "apathy" of
<br>those hoping for more. Gauging the number of such people has
<br>been complicated by the lack of an organization or party for
<br>them to affiliate with. The personalities at the head of the
<br>standard, western-leaning Yabloko and Union of Right Forces
<br>parties have worn thin and street opposition of the sort
<br>promoted by Other Russia has no appeal for the middle class.
<br>
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Separately, xxxxx told us xxxxx "on projects I cannot talk
<br>about," he was convinced Medvedev was looking for ways to
<br>signal change. The President-elect was adamant on the need
<br>for internet freedom and the inability of the government to
<br>control satellite airwaves. Moreover, xxxxx argued that
<br>Medvedev was sensitive to the repercussions of the
<br>administration's heartless approach to former Yukos VP
<br>Aleksanyan's medical condition, although Medvedev was
<br>unlikely to expend political capital at the outset to tackle
<br>this case. xxxxx emphasized that the average Russian
<br>citizen was "as far as the stars" from Western liberal values
<br>-- seeing even the limited liberalism that Medvedev
<br>represents as beyond the pale of what a "free and fair"
<br>election would generate. For a frustrated journalist like
<br>himself, xxxxx posited that Medvedev offered a reasonable
<br>route to reform that the "radicals" such as Kasparov and
<br>Limonov did not.
<br>
<br>The Tandem Factor
<br>-----------------
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Whatever Medvedev's intentions about pursuing a
<br>reform agenda may be, much will depend on how the
<br>Medvedev-Putin "tandemocracy" will function; something most
<br>observers suspect even Putin and Medvedev do not understand
<br>completely. Some suggest, and Medvedev seemed to agree in
<br>his "Itogi" interview, that all power resides in the
<br>
<br>presidency and, sooner or later, Medvedev will eclipse Putin
<br>as first among equals. They see in Putin's stress on
<br>continuity, efforts to elaborate a strategy to 2020, and
<br>comments that there is no daylight between him and Medvedev
<br>on foreign policy, a tacit acknowledgment that Putin's
<br>ability to chart the course has been curtailed with Medvedev
<br>in the President's seat. It follows for them that a
<br>diminished Putin will therefore remain Prime Minister only
<br>long enough to ensure a smooth transition before bowing out.
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Others are less certain. xxxxx believes that Putin did his best to
<br>handicap Medvedev in preparing him for the presidency.
<br>Unlike Putin, the President-elect has no network in the
<br>Kremlin or the regions, unlike Putin who, xxxxx said, on
<br>becoming President, could count on the loyalty of the
<br>security services throughout the country. xxxxx thought the
<br>"siloviki's" continued loyalty to Putin would cause them to
<br>undercut any of Medvedev's efforts at reform or
<br>liberalization. In any event, xxxxx said, "Medvedev has
<br>worked for 17 years in Putin's authoritarian shadow" without
<br>revealing any liberal impulses. Why would they appear now?"
<br>
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Under Putin, Russians have seen an improvement in
<br>their lives and the stabilization of the political sphere.
<br>Medvedev comes from a different generation and outlook than
<br>his predecessor and he seems to "get it" that Russia needs
<br>reform in order to develop. And there is a potentially
<br>influential stratum of support that is quietly hoping for
<br>change and waiting for leadership. The question remains as
<br>to how far Medvedev is willing to go, particularly under
<br>Putin's watchful eye.
