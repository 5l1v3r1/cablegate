<br>SUBJECT: PRC/IRAN: SCHOLAR SUGGESTS U.S. NEGOTIATE SE 
<br>CRETLY WITH IRAN 
<br> 
<br>REF: BEIJING 1803 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Aubrey Carlson.  Reasons 1. 
<br>4 (b/d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY:  The unstable post-election political climate 
<br>in Iran likely precludes the initiation of formal 
<br>negotiations with Iran on ceasing its uranium enrichment 
<br>program, according to a PRC scholar.  Though Iran is sincere 
<br>in wishing to reach out to the United States on broader 
<br>bilateral issues, it remains wary of "falling into a trap" in 
<br>bilateral negotiations.  Under these circumstances, the 
<br>scholar suggests, the United States should undertake "se 
<br>cret" talks with Iran that would entail a U.S. concession 
<br>allowing Iran some nuclear enrichment activities in return 
<br>for Iran's adherence to a strict IAEA safeguard agreement, 
<br>its cessation of support for Hamas and Hizbollah, and 
<br>cooperation in Iraq and Afghanistan.  China has encouraged 
<br>Iran to enter into negotiations with the United States, 
<br>according to our contact, while the United States is involved 
<br>in regional conflicts where Iran could play a positive role. 
<br>However, the scholar stressed, pressing for additional 
<br>sanctions through the P5-plus-1 mechanism would be 
<br>counterproductive and put China in a "difficult position" of 
<br>having to side with either the United States or Iran.  END 
<br>SUMMARY. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) Director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the 
<br>MFA-affiliated China Institute for International Studies 
<br>(CIIS) and frequent media commentator on Middle East issues 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX told PolOff August 24 that though the unexpected 
<br>turmoil surrounding the June 12 Iranian election had 
<br>politically weakened both President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and 
<br>supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, both they and 
<br>opposition candidate Mir Hussein Moussavi were "one side of a 
<br>coin" in that none of them supported the suspension of Iran's 
<br>uranium enrichment activities. 
<br> 
<br>Post-Election Atmosphere Not Right for Negotiations 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) Li argued that Ahmadinejad's congratulatory letter 
<br>sent to President Obama following the 2008 U.S. elections had 
<br>been a sincere indication of the Iranian leadership's 
<br>willingness to talk.  Li said he had learned that former 
<br>Iranian foreign minister Ali Akbar Velayati had discreetly 
<br>contacted USG officials prior to the June 12 presidential 
<br>election in Iran, agreeing to resume bilateral contacts after 
<br>the election concluded, but that the turmoil and the 
<br>lingering instability in Iran had prevented movement on that 
<br>initiative.  Li reported that his contacts in Iran had 
<br>recently said that the Iranian political climate 
<br>post-election was still not stable enough for the leadership 
<br>to engage in public negotiations on the nuclear issue. 
<br> 
<br>"Obama Factor" 
<br>-------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) Li said an additional factor adding to the Iranian 
<br>leadership's reticence to reach out to the United States was 
<br>President Obama's positive image among the Iranian public. 
<br>("Obama is with us," was an example of public sentiment 
<br>reported to him by his Iranian contacts.)  Despite the fact 
<br>that the leadership was satisfied with President Obama's 
<br>statements after the June election, Iranian leaders were wary 
<br>of "falling into a trap" in negotiations with United States. 
<br>Li suggested that Khamenei remained suspicious of the United 
<br>Kingdom, France and Germany based on the Iranian leadership's 
<br>perception that these countries had played a role in stirring 
<br>post-election turmoil. 
<br> 
<br>Grand Bargain in the Works? 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) Li stated that Iran agreeing to suspend uranium 
<br>enrichment unilaterally or completely was a "non-starter." 
<br>Li cited unnamed contacts in the United States "with close 
<br>access to policy-makers on Iran" to support his belief that 
<br>the United States would be willing to accept some 
<br>internationally-supervised uranium enrichment by Iran.  This 
<br>would be a concession, Li said, that "the Europeans would 
<br>have great difficulty accepting."  To make such a concession 
<br>diplomatically palatable, Li continued, the United States in 
<br>return would expect Iran's cessation of support for Hamas and 
<br>Hizbollah, among other terrorist groups in the region, and 
<br>its cooperation in Iraq and Afghanistan.  In addition, Li 
<br>suggested, the United States would expect Iran to agree to a 
<br>stricter IAEA safeguard agreement that would control Iran's 
<br>nuclear activities and include terms that would be integrated 
<br>into the NPT as a basis for further safeguards governing all 
<br> 
<br>BEIJING 00002438  002 OF 002 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>NPT signatory countries (reftel).  He stated that before 
<br>agreeing to a low level of Iranian enrichment activity, the 
<br>United States would insist Iran implement a 
<br>six-to-twelve-month freeze on nuclear enrichment activities. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) Li stressed that any Iranian nuclear program 
<br>negotiations, which he believed would be lengthy, should be 
<br>"se cret" and seek to produce a "win/win" scenario for both 
<br>countries.  Li stated that Iran had doubts about the USG's 
<br>ability to enter such a bargain, given U.S. political 
<br>pressures, and that to the Iranians, a signal of U.S. 
<br>sincerity to move forward might come through an unofficial 
<br>visit along the lines of Henry Kissinger's late June trip to 
<br>China to discuss North Korea sanctions or former President 
<br>Clinton's early August visit to Pyongyang to effect the 
<br>release of the two American journalists, which in his view 
<br>had allowed the atmosphere for negotiations with the DPRK to 
<br>improve.  Li suggested that former President Clinton could 
<br>perhaps secure the release of the American hikers detained by 
<br>Iranian authorities.  Li stated that the key element of a 
<br>Kissinger visit would be the former Secretary of State's 
<br>ability to have discreet, private and informal discussions. 
<br> 
<br>China Urges Iran to Reach Out to the United States 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----- 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) Despite U.S.-Iranian tensions, the PRC had encouraged 
<br>Iran to take advantage of current circumstances to mend ties 
<br>with the United States, according to Li, arguing that the 
<br>United States would be more open to making concessions now 
<br>because it was in a relatively weaker position tending to a 
<br>number of trouble spots around the world, including the 
<br>Middle East and South Asia, and needed Iran's help in Iraq 
<br>and Afghanistan.  However, as the United States regained its 
<br>position of strength, according to Li, its willingness to 
<br>make concessions would disappear.  Li reported that MFA West 
<br>Asian and North African Affairs Department Director General 
<br>Song Aiguo had affirmed to him recently that China "would do 
<br>whatever it could" to assist communication between the United 
<br>States and Iran.  Asked whether Iran viewed China as a fair 
<br>broker, Li said, "Iran trusts nobody."  While Iran understood 
<br>China's interests in Iran, the Iranian leadership believed 
<br>that when pushed to make a choice, China would side with the 
<br>United States over Iran. 
<br> 
<br>P5 plus 1: A Show for Public Consumption 
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (C) Li stated that the P5-plus-1 process "was for public 
<br>consumption" and that expectations of its success should be 
<br>minimal.  Acknowledging the increasing pressure for 
<br>additional sanctions given Iran's current unresponsiveness to 
<br>offers of engagement, Li stated that pushing for additional 
<br>sanctions would play to the hard-liners' advantage in Iran 
<br>and not bring any change in Iranian behavior.  In addition, 
<br>the prospect of imposing additional sanctions would put China 
<br>in a "difficult position" of choosing between its interests 
<br>vis-a-vis the United States and Iran, a choice it hoped to 
<br>avoid.
