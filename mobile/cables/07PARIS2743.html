<br>
<br>¶3. (S) Summary: U/S Burns and Political Director Gerard Araud 
<br>met June 12 for a lengthy discussion of key bilateral issues, 
<br>including Colombia hostages, Russia (MD and CFE), NATO 
<br>enlargement/Georgia, Iran, Lebanon/Syria, Afghanistan, and 
<br>Turkey/EU. Araud emphasized the new, more positive tone in 
<br>the U.S.-French relationship since Sarkozy's election to the 
<br>Presidency and affirmed that France would seek to avoid 
<br>airing disagreements in public. Prior to the meeting, Burns 
<br>and Araud exchanged information on the status of French and 
<br>U.S. hostages in Colombia and agreed to consult in Paris and 
<br>Bogota. Araud cited recent unhelpful Russian statements on 
<br>Missile Defense and CFE deployments as indicative of Russia's 
<br>bluntly assertive foreign policy. Sarkozy, said Araud, is 
<br>seeking a positive relationship with Putin while at the same 
<br>time pressing him without immediate success on human rights 
<br>and Chechnya. Araud suggested that, on CFE, Russia might be 
<br>justified in questioning the U.S. troop presence in the 
<br>Balkans. The challenge is to find a middle way between 
<br>complacency and confrontation in dealing with Putin and the 
<br>new Russia, Araud emphasized. Burns and Araud agreed on 
<br>continued public support for Georgian President Sakaashvili, 
<br>while cautioning him against provoking the Russians. France, 
<br>however, maintained strong doubts as to whether Georgia has 
<br>an eventual vocation as a member of NATO. Burns pushed back, 
<br>reminding Araud that we needed to safeguard democratic 
<br>principles in Europe by being more inclusive. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Summary cont'd: Araud agreed with Burns on Iran's 
<br>non-compliance with UNSC resolutions, and on the need for an 
<br>additional resolution and sanctions outside the UNSC. Burns 
<br>stated that a diplomatic resolution was still possible and 
<br>biting sanctions likely were necessary to achieve that end. 
<br>The French registered Burns' statements that the United 
<br>States had proof that Iran was providing arms in Iraq, to the 
<br>Taliban in Afghanistan, and to Hizballah in Lebanon. French 
<br>Presidency advisors, however, cautioned that the evidence was 
<br>not yet strong enough in Lebanon to justify pressing Tehran; 
<br>France also did not wish to risk losing its dialogue with 
<br>Iran. On Lebanon, Araud agreed that France should have 
<br>consulted the U.S. prior to initiating its call for a Lebanon 
<br>"national dialogue" conference, and affirmed Sarkozy's 
<br>intention to maintain existing French policy towards Lebanon 
<br>alongside close consultation with the United States. On 
<br>Afghanistan, Araud reiterated France's decision to increase 
<br>its Operational Mentoring and Liaison teams (OMLTs) from one 
<br>to four, bringing the total number of French trainers for the 
<br>Afghan National Army to over 150 personnel. Pressed on PRTs, 
<br>a Presidential advisor said that France was studying the 
<br>concept and presented it to Sarkozy as one of several 
<br>options. Araud added that European support for Allied 
<br>efforts in Afghanistan was not open-ended. Araud also said 
<br>that Sarkozy was seeking to decrease tensions with Turkey 
<br>with a proposal to move forward on those EU accession 
<br>chapters that would apply equally to membership and 
<br>partnership status. Paris had also informed Ankara that the 
<br>GOF would not support a vote in the French Senate on a 
<br>controversial resolution on Armenia. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>Bilateral Relationship 
<br>---------------------- 
<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Araud began the discussion by noting that the Sarkozy 
<br>government was opening a new period in the bilateral 
<br>relationship. France remains a good friend of the United 
<br>States, and will seek even closer ties with us. That said, 
<br>France will not hesitate to express disagreement when 
<br>France's approach differs from that of the U.S. Referring to 
<br>past differences over Iraq, Araud stated that France sees no 
<br>need to make our disagreements public -- we will discuss and 
<br>consult first. Araud observed that former French Ambassador 
<br>Jean-David Levitte, who is Sarkozy's new Diplomatic Advisor, 
<br>has a track record of working well with the United States. 
<br>Burns concurred, telling Araud that the U.S. had taken 
<br>positive note of the new French government's decision to drop 
<br>public calls for a "time horizon" for withdrawal of foreign 
<br>forces from Iraq. 
<br>
<br>Colombia 
<br>-------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S) In an aside before the dinner, Araud described how 
<br>Ingrid Betancourt's release had become such an important 
<br>cause in France, one which President Sarkozy had insistently 
<br>associated himself with during the presidential campaign. 
<br>Burns noted that since August 2003 there had been no proof of 
<br>life of the American hostages in Colombia. However, 
<br>extensive interviews with the recently escaped FARC prisoner 
<br>had led us to believe the information he provided was 
<br>credible; there may now be grounds for believing the U.S. 
<br>hostages, held together with Betancourt, are still alive. 
<br>Loras replied that based on French interviews of the same 
<br>escapee, the GOF was skeptical. The information provided was 
<br>far too detailed, possibly indicating it was planted -- and 
<br>the whole "escape" potentially a fake. Araud and Burns 
<br>agreed to further consultations between our missions in 
<br>Bogota and in Paris. Loras asked that such talks begin in 
<br>Paris. Araud referred us to the Presidency for future 
<br>consultations on this sensitive topic. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) Comment: In a follow-up conversation with Pol/MC after 
<br>the dinner, Loras was much less categorical, saying at least 
<br>a week was needed to review the information concerning the 
<br>hostages' well-being and whereabouts. We agreed to consult 
<br>closely, especially with the Presidency. End Comment. 
<br>
<br>Russia, Missile Defense and CFE 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Echoing almost verbatim his previous comments to 
<br>visiting staffdel Myers (ref B), Araud stated that Russia has 
<br>become a problem as it regresses to a traditional Czarist 
<br>foreign policy -- imperialist and brutal, reflecting endemic 
<br>racism, anti-Semitism and nationalism. By way of an example, 
<br>he noted that a high-ranking member of the Duma recently 
<br>exclaimed to a visiting French official, "so, you've elected 
<br>the Jew Sarkozy!" Araud also observed that Russia feels 
<br>besieged by NATO, the U.S. and the West. Faced with the 
<br>"trauma" of dealing with Chechnya, and the "humiliation" of 
<br>retreat from former territories during the Yeltsin years, 
<br>Russia is unlikely to modify its imperialist foreign policy 
<br>in the near future. Our collective challenge, emphasized 
<br>Araud, is to find a middle way "between complacency and 
<br>confrontation" in dealing with Putin and this "new Russia." 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Burns said that President Bush sees continuing value 
<br>in the relationship, especially on such important issues as 
<br>fighting terrorism and wmd proliferation, and so had chosen 
<br>not to respond in kind to Putin's heated rhetoric. The U.S. 
<br>has deliberately refrained from reacting publicly to Putin's 
<br>recent provocative statements on CFE, MD, and other issues. 
<br>Loras said that Sarkozy is seeking to develop a positive 
<br>relationship with Putin, but without significant success to 
<br>date. In their meeting, Sarkozy had raised with Putin human 
<br>rights concerns, including the situation in Chechnya, the 
<br>violent repression of a recent gay rights parade in Moscow, 
<br>and the assassination of Anna Politkovskaya. Putin reacted 
<br>by attacking human rights (prison conditions) in France. 
<br>Additionally, Loras noted that two days after Sarkozy had 
<br>lobbied Putin for the purchase of Airbuses, Russia announced 
<br>the purchase of Boeing aircraft. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Araud stated that Putin had explained to Sarkozy the 
<br>Russian proposal to locate part of the U.S. Missile Defense 
<br>
<br>(MD) program in Azerbajian. The French were appreciative of 
<br>the briefings General Obering had provided in France, as they 
<br>helped to understand better the U.S. project -- and the 
<br>Russian response. The Russians, Araud concluded, are trying 
<br>to divide the Allies by questioning the Iranian threat and 
<br>proposing a sensible alternative to basing MD defense in 
<br>central Europe. Burns said that the Russians, in offering an 
<br>Azerbajian option, were, in fact, implicitly recognizing the 
<br>reality of an Iranian threat and the need for missile 
<br>defense. The United States, meanwhile, remains open to MD 
<br>coordination with NATO. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Regarding CFE, Araud ventured that Russia might have 
<br>a basis for its desire for some reciprocity. The Russians 
<br>had made progress in Georgia, yet we say we will never ratify 
<br>until the Istanbul commitments are completely fulfilled: the 
<br>GOF is not sure this is the best approach. Furthermore, the 
<br>Russians could argue that U.S. bases in Bulgaria and Romania 
<br>are intended not only for training, but in fact amounted to 
<br>"substantial" new deployments. Burns pushed back, reminding 
<br>Araud that Russia had concurred on those basing agreements. 
<br>Araud agreed that the Russians were guilty of revisionist 
<br>history, but the Allies nonetheless needed to offer Russia a 
<br>way out. 
<br>
<br>Georgia 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Turning to the then-upcoming June 13 Sarkozy meeting 
<br>with Georgian President Saakashvili, Loras commented that the 
<br>Presidents had met twice before. In public, Loras added, 
<br>France will convey a message of "strong support." Privately, 
<br>however, the French planned to urge Sakaashvili not to 
<br>provoke the Russians, to avoid raising tensions, and to work 
<br>on the human rights situation in Georgia. The Georgians are 
<br>looking to use NATO as a shield; they "should not play with 
<br>fire" by baiting Moscow, Loras emphasized. Burns said the 
<br>USG also had counseled Sakaashvili against provoking the 
<br>Russians, but Sakaashvili will be nervous until Georgia has 
<br>obtained MAP. Burns explained that the U.S. had told the 
<br>Georgian President that while NATO's door remains open, 
<br>Georgia must meet its obligations under NATO. 
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Voicing well-known French reservations over NATO 
<br>membership for Georgia, Araud questioned whether membership 
<br>ultimately made sense: "Georgia in NATO means problems; it 
<br>should have the diplomacy of its geography." He pointed to 
<br>Finland -- a prosperous and independent non-NATO country on 
<br>Russia's border -- as a possible model. Presidential advisor 
<br>Richier added that decisions on the borders of Europe for the 
<br>EU and NATO were open. Is Georgia-in-NATO a security 
<br>interest? Araud concluded by stating that Sarkozy has not 
<br>yet addressed Georgia policy. Burns explained that the USG 
<br>would like to see Georgia obtain MAP status and eventual NATO 
<br>membership. We clearly have a different view of NATO: we 
<br>see a political imperative in bringing in democracies. The 
<br>same logic that brought the Baltics into NATO applies to 
<br>Georgia. Russian objections should not block the membership 
<br>track; Moscow should not have a veto. The future of Russia 
<br>is not readily predictable, hence the U.S. would like to 
<br>ensure that as much of Europe is democratic and protected by 
<br>NATO as possible. 
<br>
<br>Iran 
<br>---- 
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) Araud and Burns agreed that Iran is not complying 
<br>with UNSC sanctions and continues to move forward with its 
<br>nuclear program. Regarding next steps, Araud observed that 
<br>while it may be difficult to obtain new UN sanctions with 
<br>more bite, UNSC action nevertheless serves to provide 
<br>legitimacy. He observed that the French Embassy in Tehran 
<br>reports that U.S. financial sanctions have been very 
<br>effective, but that Iran is not yet ready to yield to 
<br>international pressure. In fact, the regime is in a 
<br>hardening period. We must therefore manage the crisis for 
<br>the long term ("pour la dure"), and keep our nerves. 
<br>Richier suggested that we should continue to seek another 
<br>UNSC resolution before proceeding to a review of other 
<br>options including alternate sanctions -- on which Sarkozy 
<br>would have to be consulted. He added that the United States 
<br>and France should refrain from public discussion of such 
<br>sanctions to avoid giving the impression, at this stage of 
<br>
<br>UNSC discussions, that we plan to move forward regardless of 
<br>results in New York. Burns reviewed his recent discussions 
<br>of Iran with Israeli officials, nothing that they agreed with 
<br>the USG that there still is time for a diplomatic solution. 
<br>Stronger sanctions and economic pressure will be essential to 
<br>achieving that end. Other governments must be convinced of 
<br>that essential point. 
<br>
<br>Iran/Lebanon 
<br>------------ 
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) Burns also reviewed how Iran violated UNSC 
<br>resolutions by providing arms to Hizballah in Lebanon, which 
<br>appears to be taking new steps to threaten Israel, and to the 
<br>Taliban in Afghanistan. Loras responded that, given that the 
<br>evidence on Hizballah arms in Lebanon is not verifiable, 
<br>France is not currently pushing Iran on this issue. Araud 
<br>added that France is trying to keep open its dialogue with 
<br>Larijani on Lebanon. All agreed that financial sanctions 
<br>remain an effective way to pressure Iran to behave. Burns 
<br>briefed Araud on the status of Iranian-American hostages held 
<br>by Iran, and requested an appeal for their release by the 
<br>French Ambassador. Araud replied that he has already raised 
<br>the matter with Iranian authorities, and recalled that it had 
<br>taken France a year to obtain the freedom of a French hostage 
<br>in Iran. 
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) Araud stated that Sarkozy had told President Bush 
<br>that France would maintain its policy on Lebanon, minus its 
<br>exclusive Harriri focus. Sarkozy had also solicited 
<br>President Bush's advice about talking with Syria. Araud said 
<br>Sarkozy responded that now is not the time, as Syria remains 
<br>very destructive. Burns told Araud that the United States 
<br>had been surprised at not having been consulted prior to 
<br>France's recent call for a conference on Lebanon in Paris. 
<br>Araud contritely agreed that consultations in advance were 
<br>warranted. Returning briefly to a discussion of the renewal 
<br>of UNIFIL, MOD advisor Mondoloni revealed that the French 
<br>military would like to downsize its presence, but that 
<br>civilian leaders had emphasized to them that political 
<br>obligations were paramount. 
<br>
<br>Afghanistan 
<br>----------- 
<br>
<br>¶17. (C) Araud and Richier confirmed previous reporting on new 
<br>French commitments for Afghanistan (reftels). They 
<br>emphasized that despite campaign rhetoric, France is staying 
<br>the course in Afghanistan. Paris plans to increase the 
<br>number of French "Operational Mentoring and Liaison Teams 
<br>(OMLTs)," from the current one to four, bringing the total 
<br>number of French personnel training the Afghan Army to over 
<br>150 trainers. They also noted that following a review of 
<br>Afghanistan policy and, at the request of the Presidency, 
<br>Paris was reexaming how to improve French assistance efforts. 
<br>Burns asked about the possibility that France could 
<br>establish a PRT, noting it was the only NATO Ally not so 
<br>involved. Richier admitted that France is studying PRT 
<br>operations, but that the option of establishing one had not 
<br>been raised during earlier the policy review. It is 
<br>important to note, he added, that in contrast to previous 
<br>French positions, the Government is not dismissing out of 
<br>hand the PRT option: Sarkozy had still not completed the 
<br>review of, or reached to final conclusions on, France's 
<br>Afghanistan policy. 
<br>
<br>¶18. (C) Araud reiterated the French observation that European 
<br>governments and publics are not committed to a long-term 
<br>engagement in Afghanistan: there is a certain "fragility to 
<br>the European presence there." For example, the German 
<br>government faces difficult battles with the Bundestag every 
<br>time it needs to renew its military presence there. "We 
<br>(Europeans) are in Afghanistan to demonstrate support for the 
<br>United States," Araud added; Europeans do see it as a vital 
<br>interest of their own. While France's earlier call for a 
<br>"contact group" had been ill-conceived, urgent but discreet 
<br>Quad format discussions are needed on preparing an "exit 
<br>strategy" or "success strategy." Neither the Allies nor the 
<br>Taliban can win decisively in Afghanistan, Araud commented. 
<br>We therefore must continue work to get the Afghans to assume 
<br>control of their future. Additionally, President Karzai 
<br>needs to better address Pashtun grievances, which fuel 
<br>support for the Taliban, he concluded. Burns, citing the 
<br>
<br>Balkans as an example, noted that the USG does not believe 
<br>the Allies should leave Afghanistan any time soon. 
<br>
<br>Turkey 
<br>------ 
<br>
<br>¶19. (C) In a brief exchange on Turkey, Burns reviewed the 
<br>PKK's recent announcement that it would cease attacks, and 
<br>USG contacts with Ankara regarding the negative impact of any 
<br>cross border operation into Iraq. Araud related that Sarkozy 
<br>and Levitte were seeking to decrease tensions with Turkey by 
<br>supporting EU progress on 31 of the 35 accession chapters, 
<br>i.e., those chapters that would apply equally to a privileged 
<br>partnership with Turkey (the other four applying only to 
<br>membership). Levitte had explained Sarkozy's position to the 
<br>Turks during a recent visit to Ankara, where he also informed 
<br>the GOT that Sarkozy would ensure that the Armenia genocide 
<br>bill would die in the French Senate.
