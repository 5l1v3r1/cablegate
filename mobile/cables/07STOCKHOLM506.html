<br>SUBJECT: SWEDEN:  SCENE-SETTER FOR PRIME MINISTER
<br>REINFELDT'S MAY 15 VISIT TO WASHINGTON
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Wood, reason 1.4 (b) and (d).
<br>
<br>Summary
<br>-------
<br>¶1.  (c) The May 15 visit of Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt
<br>provides an opportunity to strengthen ties in key areas with
<br>a Swedish government that is relatively new to office and
<br>better-disposed toward working with the U.S. than its
<br>predecessor.  Reinfeldt comes from a new political generation
<br>and is not bound by the same U.S.-critical traditions.  At
<br>the Embassy, we have successfully emphasized cooperation with
<br>Sweden on alternative energy.  Reinfeldt has put energy and
<br>climate issues at the top of his domestic agenda, and told
<br>the Ambassador May 4 that he hoped that his trip would help
<br>change perceptions in Sweden about the U.S. on this subject.
<br>Reinfeldt said he will raise with President Bush climate
<br>change and energy issues, Turkey, Russia and Sweden's Eastern
<br>neighbors, Afghanistan, Kosovo, and Iran.  While Sweden's
<br>official foreign policy doctrine emphasizes non-alignment, in
<br>practice Sweden is a pragmatic and strong partner with NATO,
<br>having troops under NATO command in Kosovo and Afghanistan,
<br>where it leads a Provincial Reconstruction Team.  In addition
<br>to the meeting with President Bush, Reinfeldt will meet May
<br>14 with SGY Ban Ki-moon and other UN officials in New York,
<br>will meet in Washington with Speaker Pelosi and address the
<br>House Select Committee on Energy, and will visit May 16 the
<br>National Renewable Energy Lab in Colorado.  End Summary.
<br>
<br>Reinfeldt as Prime Minister
<br>---------------------------
<br>¶2.  (u) Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt will meet with
<br>President Bush May 15.  Reinfeldt, 41, became Prime Minister
<br>in October 2006 following the victory in parliamentary
<br>elections of his center/right coalition, the Alliance for
<br>Sweden.  Reinfeldt's Moderate party has the leading role in
<br>the Alliance, controlling the ministries of Finance, Foreign
<br>Affairs, Justice, and Defense.  The others making up the
<br>Alliance government are the Center, Liberal, and Christian
<br>Democrat parties.  Before this election, Social Democrats had
<br>controlled the government for 64 of the prior 73 years.
<br>
<br>¶3. (u) The Moderate-led government was voted into office by
<br>promising to create jobs while protecting the fundamentals of
<br>Sweden's long-established and popular social welfare system.
<br>During seven months in office, the Alliance government has
<br>changed the labor laws to reduce unemployment benefits and
<br>provide incentives to employment.  It has announced plans to
<br>do away with the wealth tax and abolish the valuation-based
<br>property tax, replacing it with a much-reduced local tax.  It
<br>has introduced and is expected to pass legislation
<br>authorizing the sale of six large state-owned businesses
<br>during the coming three years.
<br>
<br>Sweden as a Partner
<br>-------------------
<br>¶4.  (u) The new government retains Sweden's commitment to
<br>multilateralism, with an emphasis on the roles of the UN and
<br>EU, and values continued cooperation with NATO.  Sweden has
<br>troops under NATO command in Kosovo (300 troops) and
<br>Afghanistan (250 troops), where it leads the Provincial
<br>Reconstruction Team at Mazar-e-Sharif.  The government
<br>recently introduced legislation to raise the number of troops
<br>authorized for deployment in Afghanistan to 600, with the
<br>proviso that they will be deployed only if circumstances
<br>require.
<br>
<br>¶5.  (c) Sweden's official security policy is
<br>non-participation in military alliances during peacetime and
<br>neutrality during wartime.  Its active participation in the
<br>NATO Partnership for Peace and its role in leading the
<br>European Union's 1,500 troops-strong Nordic Battle group give
<br>the lie to the official policy.  Sweden has opted out of
<br>buying two C-17s and has subsequently joined and made the
<br>second-highest contribution to the NATO-sponsored Strategic
<br>Airlift Capability.  This will, in the long run, support of
<br>the Nordic Battle group and other strategic lift
<br>requirements.  Sweden also plays an important role in Darfur,
<br>where former Swedish Foreign Minister Jan Eliasson is the UN
<br>Special Envoy and Sweden supports democratization and
<br>humanitarian relief.  Within the EU, Sweden often takes
<br>positions that coincide with our own on issues as diverse as
<br>the DOHA round, EU enlargement and Turkey, Swift banking data
<br>privacy, and the EU's relationship with Cuba.
<br>
<br>¶6.  (s) Swedish military and civilian intelligence
<br>organizations are strong and reliable partners on a range of
<br>key issues, particularly making a significant contribution to
<br>our understanding of events inside the Russian military and
<br>
<br>STOCKHOLM 00000506  002 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>in Iran's nuclear ambitions.  The good cooperation on
<br>counterterrorism, both domestically and internationally, has
<br>helped Swedish authorities carry out their mandate to protect
<br>Swedish citizens and national interests.  Due to domestic
<br>political considerations, the extent of this cooperation in
<br>not widely known within the Swedish government and it would
<br>be useful to acknowledge this cooperation privately, as
<br>public mention of the cooperation would open up the
<br>government to domestic criticism.
<br>
<br>Cooperation on Alternative Energy
<br>---------------------------------
<br>¶7.  (u) Embassy Stockholm has set as its highest priority
<br>cooperation with Sweden to achieve a breakthrough in the
<br>development of alternative energy sources.  As a leader in
<br>research and development and policy initiatives in
<br>alternative energy, Sweden is a natural partner to the U.S.
<br>The government has invested extensively in energy research
<br>and provides a wide array of policy incentives to stimulate
<br>the expansion of renewable power production and the use of
<br>alternative fuels and energy.  The new government has pledged
<br>to cut CO2 emissions by 25 percent by the year 2020.  A
<br>strong proponent of the Kyoto Protocol, Sweden is one of only
<br>two EU countries likely to meet its 2012 Kyoto Protocol
<br>targets.
<br>
<br>¶8.  (c) The Swedes assume the EU presidency in the latter
<br>half of 2009 and have announced that climate change will be
<br>at the top of their agenda (we note that this will be just as
<br>serious campaigning begins for Sweden's September 2010
<br>parliamentary elections).  We also note that Sweden was a
<br>strong supporter in the EU of positive U.S.-EU Summit
<br>Statement on energy security, efficiency, and climate change.
<br> Sweden considers it critically important that the United
<br>States be at the table during discussions of a post-2012
<br>framework to address climate change.  Sweden will do what it
<br>can to help set conditions to ensure that the United States,
<br>as well as China, India and other primary GHG emitters from
<br>the developing world are brought into these discussions and
<br>negotiations.  Swedish Minister of Environment Andreas
<br>Carlgren is hosting a ministerial June 11-14 in northern
<br>Sweden entitled "Midnight Sun Dialogue on Climate Change."
<br>It is important to note that the title does not mention the
<br>word Kyoto; this is no accident.  The Swedes hope to usher in
<br>a post-2012 agreement during their 2009 Presidency of the EU.
<br> PM Reinfeldt will want to discuss his plans with you.
<br>
<br>¶9.  (c) The Embassy's initiative on intensifying
<br>collaboration with Sweden on alternative energy (known as
<br>"The One Big Thing" - OBT) has helped ease the path for the
<br>more constructive tone of discussions on climate change in
<br>Sweden and has done much to set a positive overall tone
<br>between our governments.  The emergence of the new
<br>center-right government -- reflexively more pro-American and
<br>pro-business -- has been fortuitous.  PM Reinfeldt and his
<br>ministers want to work with us, understand well the need for
<br>technology-based solutions to energy needs, and recognize
<br>that important new opportunities exist for Swedish business
<br>which is on the cutting edge of alternative energy technology
<br>and research.  There is both good will and the desire for
<br>bottom line results.  The success of the "One Big Thing" will
<br>not ultimately depend on political good will, but on results.
<br> Reinfeldt told the Ambassador there had been a dramatic
<br>shift in Sweden and in the EU on the possibility of providing
<br>technology-based solutions to a reduction of green-house
<br>gases; green issues could be combined with market-based
<br>solutions.
<br>
<br>¶10.  (c) The OBT has made significant progress in several key
<br>areas.  Among the most significant are:
<br>
<br>-- Negotiation (in progress) of a DoE/Sweden/Volvo joint
<br>research agreement regarding hybrid engines for heavy trucks;
<br>-- Commitment by Sweden's Chalmers University to host a
<br>Fulbright Distinguished Chair in Alternative Energy
<br>Technology; Chair to arrive in August 2008;
<br>-- Matching promising initiatives with venture capital,  List
<br>of 30 promising Swedish alternative energy companies given to
<br>18 U.S. Venture Capital firms interested in alternative
<br>energy investment; the meeting which took place on 4/19 in
<br>Stanford, California generated considerable interest;
<br>-- Participation of Swedish industry in an imminent contract
<br>awarded by DARPA to Swedish Biofuels AB for the development
<br>of jet fuel made from bio fuels;
<br>-- An agreement on second generation biofuels between the
<br>Swedish Energy Agency and the DOE will soon be ready for
<br>signature.

<br>
<br>Topics the Prime Minister will Raise
<br>------------------------------------
<br>¶11.  (s) Prime Minister Reinfeldt has informed us he plans to
<br>raise with President Bush:
<br>
<br>-- Climate change and energy.  This may include reference to
<br>a post-2012 framework, especially in the context of Sweden's
<br>EU presidency in the second half of 2009, and cooperation on
<br>alternative energy;
<br>-- DOHA, where Sweden has played a positive role in the EU.
<br>Reinfeldt told the Ambassador Sweden would like to see the
<br>DOHA round finalized during the German presidency of the EU.
<br>A prominent Swedish businessman, Marcus Wallenberg, is also
<br>Chair of the International Chamber of Commerce and has
<br>lobbied on behalf of DOHA;
<br>-- Turkey, where Reinfeldt is concerned that the split within
<br>the EU could become more pronounced if Sarkozy wins the
<br>French elections.  Reinfeldt told the Ambassador May 4 that a
<br>French move to make it harder for Turkey to join could be
<br>make it easier for Germany, which is also reluctant for
<br>Turkey to join, to come down on the right side.  In Sweden's
<br>view, signaling to Turkey that its chances are decreasing
<br>would be the wrong message, particularly in view of upcoming
<br>elections in Turkey.
<br>-- Russia and Sweden's Eastern neighbors.  Reinfeldt
<br>mentioned energy security as a primary issue; Sweden is
<br>likely also to raise democratization and human rights issues,
<br>and has expressed concern over developments in Russia's
<br>relations with Estonia;
<br>-- Afghanistan, where Sweden leads a PRT.  Reinfeldt
<br>underscored to the Ambassador that Sweden is firm in its
<br>long-term commitment to the PRT and will authorize additional
<br>troops (going from 350 to 600 authorized) to go there if
<br>needed.  He did not raise or react to reports from DOD
<br>channels that U.S. defense channels had raised the
<br>possibility of a Sweden hosting a second PRT.  Sweden has
<br>previously raised concerns regarding its lack of access, as a
<br>non-member of NATO, to intelligence, particularly in
<br>connection with force protection;
<br>-- Kosovo and
<br>-- Iran.  We note that Iranian FM Mottaki will be in
<br>Stockholm May 7 and will meet with Deputy Prime Minister Maud
<br>Olofsson and FM Bildt, as well as members of parliament.
<br>
<br>Other Issues
<br>------------
<br>¶12.  (c) Immigration and refugees, including from Iraq.
<br>Sweden took in 9,000 refugees from Iraq in 2006; projections
<br>are that it will receive 25,000 Iraqi refugees in 2007.
<br>Sweden is now the destination for over one-half of all Iraqi
<br>refugees going to EU countries.  Immigrants from Muslim
<br>countries now constitute about four percent of Sweden's
<br>population.  Sweden has recently cited the burden of taking
<br>care of arriving refugees in response to U.S. requests for
<br>Sweden to consider accepting third-country nationals now in
<br>U.S. custody.
<br>
