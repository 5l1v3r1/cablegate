<br>TAGS: PTER EG GTMO
<br>SUBJECT: EGYPTIAN GTMO DETAINEES - STATUS OF DISCUSSIONS 
<br>
<br>REF: CAIRO 5589 AND PREVIOUS 
<br>
<br>Classified By: CHARGE STUART E.JONES, REASONS 1.5 B AND D 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) SUMMARY: In the context of the close and sustained 
<br>cooperation between the USG and GOE on counterterrorism, Post 
<br>believes that the written GOE assurances regarding the return 
<br>of three Egyptians detained at Guantanamo (reftel) represent 
<br>the firm commitment of the GOE to adhere to the requested 
<br>principles. These assurances were passed directly from 
<br>Egyptian General Intelligence Service (EGIS) Chief Soliman 
<br>through liaison channels -- the most effective communication 
<br>path on this issue. General Soliman's word is the GOE's 
<br>guarantee, and the GOE's track record of cooperation on CT 
<br>issues lends further support to this assessment. End summary. 
<br>
<br>
<br>EGYPTIAN ASSURANCES 
<br>------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) As stated in reftel, Post has received written 
<br>assurances from the Egyptian General Intelligence Service 
<br>(EGIS) regarding the acceptance and humane treatment of three 
<br>Egyptians currently detained in Guantanamo: 
<br>
<br>-- Abdul Rahman Mohammed AL-MARZOUQ, ISN US9EG-00369DP; 
<br>
<br>-- Allah Muhammad SALEEM, ISN US9EG-00071DP; 
<br>
<br>-- Sami Abdul Aziz Salim ALLAITHY, ISN US9EG-000287DP. 
<br>
<br>Post believes that these assurances represent a firm 
<br>commitment by the GOE to handle the matter in accordance with 
<br>our stated principles. We recommend that the interagency 
<br>consider approving transfer now on the basis of these 
<br>assurances. 
<br>
<br>
<br>DIRECT CHANNEL 
<br>-------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) Post has established that the most effective conduit 
<br>for addressing this issue is through Cairo Station - EGIS 
<br>Liaison. The written assurances (reftel) were passed directly 
<br>from EGIS Chief General Soliman through this channel. 
<br>General Soliman's stature and power in the Egyptian 
<br>establishment, and his history of close cooperation with the 
<br>USG on counterterrorism, corroborate the Egyptian intent take 
<br>responsibility for the detainees in such a way that protects 
<br>both U.S. and Egyptian security interests. In addition to 
<br>the written assurances regarding the detainees treatment, 
<br>EGIS has conveyed orally to Cairo station that all three will 
<br>be taken into custody upon arrival in Egypt and will be 
<br>investigated and prosecuted in accordance with Egyptian law. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) We understand the need for specific language on this 
<br>matter. However, the danger of seeking specificity beyond 
<br>what we have already received in EGIS' written assurances is 
<br>that EGIS may decide to turn the case over to the MFA. MFA 
<br>involvement will complicate the process and delay disposal of 
<br>the cases.
