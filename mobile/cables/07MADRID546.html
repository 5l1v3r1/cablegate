<br>SUBJECT: GOS ACKNOWLEDGES US CONCERN ABOUT IRAQ WAR COMMENTS 
<br>
<br>REF: MADRID 520 
<br>
<br>Classified By: DCM Hugo Llorens for reaons 1.4 (b) & (d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) The combination of the anniversary of the start of 
<br>Operation Iraqi Freedom with the fervor of the Spanish 
<br>campaign season led to a brief flurry of anti-US rhetoric 
<br>from public figures associated with the government. As 
<br>reported in reftel, magistrate Baltasar Garzon wrote an op-ed 
<br>on March 20 that proposed an investigation into "criminal 
<br>responsibility" for the war. Socialist Party (PSOE) 
<br>secretary Jose Blanco hopped on the bandwagon in a TV 
<br>
<br>SIPDIS 
<br>interview that evening. The Ambassador immediately contacted 
<br>National Security Adviser Casajuana to express concern. 
<br>Casajuana promised to take the message to President Zapatero. 
<br>
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Casajuana called the Ambassador late on the night of 
<br>March 21 to follow up after speaking to Zapatero. He said 
<br>that Zapatero understands the USG's concerns and will try to 
<br>bring moderation to PSOE political operatives. Zapatero said 
<br>that he appreciated the USG's efforts to stay out of the 
<br>political arena and will work to enable the US to continue 
<br>staying out. In short, the message was that Zapatero "will 
<br>not add wood to the fire." 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) DCM reiterated the USG's concerns on March 23 with MFA 
<br>DG for North America Jose Pons and asked that the GOS work to 
<br>keep the US out of the political crossfire. He told Pons 
<br>that the USG understands that the political climate in Spain 
<br>is highly polarized at the moment, but cautioned that 
<br>continued statements on this issue by senior Spanish figures 
<br>would be viewed negatively by the USG. Pons said that the 
<br>only official GOS statement on the issue had come from 
<br>Foreign Minister Moratinos, who said on March 20 that only 
<br>history will judge Iraq, thus emphasizing that the GOS would 
<br>stay far away from legal judgments on the war. Pons 
<br>emphasized that Blanco was speaking for the PSOE, not the 
<br>government, and that Garzon, an independent magistrate, 
<br>speaks only for himself. Pons said that he expects the issue 
<br>to die down now that the anniversary has passed.
