<br>SUBJECT: PRC/IRAN: CHINA SEEKS CLARITY ON U.S. IRAN POLICY, 
<br>OFFERS HELP IN TALKING TO IRAN 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Aubrey Carlson. 
<br>Reasons 1.4 (b/d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY:  China is keen to understand the direction of 
<br>U.S. policy toward the Islamic Republic of Iran (IRI) and is 
<br>willing to facilitate dialogue between the two sides, 
<br>according to an MFA official.  China remains committed to the 
<br>P5-plus-1 process but values its bilateral engagement with 
<br>Iran.  Nonetheless, the Iran should not take for granted its 
<br>economic relations with the PRC.  Despite PRC urging that 
<br>Iran respond positively to American overtures, initial rounds 
<br>of direct talks with the Iranians on the nuclear issue would 
<br>be difficult, the official suggested.  The official said that 
<br>it is too soon to contemplate what actions should be taken 
<br>should Iran develop a nuclear weapon.  An academic contact 
<br>suggested that there is no "point of no return" on Iran's 
<br>development of nuclear technology and that the Iranians 
<br>believe they are in a strong bargaining position should some 
<br>form of new diplomatic engagement emerge.  END SUMMARY. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) PolOff discussed Iran-China relations and the 
<br>international community's efforts to deal with the Iran 
<br>nuclear issue with Deputy Director Xu Wei of MFA's West Asian 
<br>Affairs Department Iran Division March 3.  PolOff also met 
<br>with Li Guofu, Director of the Center for Middle East Studies 
<br>at the MFA-affiliated China Institute for International 
<br>Studies (CIIS) February 27. 
<br> 
<br>China Seeks Clarity on Policy Review 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) MFA's Xu Wei told PolOff that China was closely 
<br>following the ongoing review of our Iran policy.  He said 
<br>that China believed that the United States maintains a 
<br>leadership role in the Middle East and that the results of 
<br>the review will have an impact on Chinese engagement with the 
<br>region.  He said that Beijing hoped for more clarity from the 
<br>United States on policy adjustments resulting from this 
<br>review, adding that China had been left to guess at how U.S. 
<br>policy might change on a very important set of shared 
<br>concerns.  In the meantime, Xu stressed, China's overall 
<br>policy toward Iran had not changed, and China would continue 
<br>to emphasize the importance of stability in the Middle East 
<br>and its opposition to the development of nuclear weapons in 
<br>the region.  Xu noted that additional clarity was especially 
<br>important because China perceives several voices in the USG 
<br>with different viewpoints on Iran speaking publicly on the 
<br>issue. 
<br> 
<br>PRC Committed to P5-plus-1, Willing to Facilitate Talks 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) Xu stressed the need to resolve the nuclear impasse 
<br>through dialogue, and added that China remained committed to 
<br>the P5-plus-1 process, as indicated in its support for the 
<br>recent P5-plus-1 joint statement on Iran.  He said that China 
<br>sincerely hoped that the outcome of our Iran policy review 
<br>would be direct U.S.-Iran talks, and offered China's 
<br>assistance in creating a channel for communication with the 
<br>Iranians. 
<br> 
<br>Official: PRC Effective at Communicating with Tehran 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------- 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) China and Iran continued to enjoy "good" relations in 
<br>both the political and economic realms, Xu said, but this did 
<br>not indicate that China supports all of Tehran's policies. 
<br>He said that China had developed strong communication with 
<br>the Iranian regime and used these channels to express to the 
<br>Iranian leadership the concerns of the P5-plus-1 and the Gulf 
<br>Cooperation Council over nuclear proliferation.  Beijing 
<br>sought to persuade Iran to play a positive role in the 
<br>region, and Chinese communication with Tehran to that end was 
<br>effective, Xu said, adding that Iran's cooperation with the 
<br>IAEA and the P5-plus-1, though limited, was due in part to 
<br>Chinese intervention.  China had made clear to Iran that 
<br>PRC-Iran economic cooperation should not be interpreted as an 
<br>indication that China is not serious about concerns over 
<br>nuclear proliferation or about working with the international 
<br>community to deal with the nuclear issue. 
<br> 
<br>Talking to Iran Would Require Patience 
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) Xu said that the U.S. policy review had generated 
<br>debate within Iran over how to respond, especially over the 
<br>possibility of direct dialogue.  China was urging the Iranian 
<br>regime to respond positively to American overtures, but Xu 
<br>said that based on his experience working on Iranian issues, 
<br>he believed the leadership will find it difficult to show a 
<br> 
<br>BEIJING 00000560  002 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>positive attitude in public.  Xu counseled patience, saying 
<br>that he was concerned that expectations in the United States 
<br>on how Iran would respond may be too high.  Still, he said 
<br>that the issues involved were too important for the United 
<br>States to fail to press forward with dialogue even if any 
<br>such discussions are difficult. 
<br> 
<br>"Too Soon" to Contemplate Weaponization Concerns 
<br>--------------------------------------------- --- 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) Pressed on how China would respond if Iran developed 
<br>nuclear weapons, Xu said that China took proliferation 
<br>concerns seriously and opposed such a development.  However, 
<br>he indicated that China did not yet see Iranian development 
<br>of nuclear weapons as an immediate concern, noting that China 
<br>was willing to "wait and see how far Iran can go" in 
<br>developing nuclear technology before it would change its 
<br>position.  He added that it was still too soon to contemplate 
<br>what actions should be taken should the Iranians develop a 
<br>nuclear weapon. 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (C) CIIS's Li Guofu echoed this approach, saying that 
<br>while China followed the Iranian nuclear program closely, 
<br>China was not 100-percent convinced that Iran is pursuing 
<br>nuclear weapons.  He indicated that observers who believe 
<br>there is a "point of no return" in Iran's technical 
<br>development of nuclear weapons were incorrect, because the 
<br>problem was fundamentally a political one and not technical. 
<br>He said that Iran was moving ahead with its nuclear program 
<br>without a clear internal position on whether it would want to 
<br>weaponize the technology, but added that Iran hoped to bring 
<br>the technology to the point where it could produce a nuclear 
<br>weapon in a short period of time.  He stressed, however, that 
<br>in his view, a complicated series of steps remained between 
<br>the current level of technology and the point of 
<br>weaponization, including the necessity for a nuclear test. 
<br>Such a test, he indicated, would have a profound effect on 
<br>the political questions facing the international community. 
<br> 
<br>U.S. Needs to Offer "Something Real" 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C) Li said that direct U.S. engagement with Iran would be 
<br>complicated by the reality that there is little the United 
<br>States can offer at present that would persuade Tehran to 
<br>change its behavior.  As the regime's confidence in its own 
<br>domestic legitimacy has grown, the value to the regime of 
<br>normalized relations with the United States has decreased. 
<br>Similarly, security guarantees would mean little to an 
<br>Iranian Government convinced that it can already ensure its 
<br>own security.  Li stressed that the U.S. side would need to 
<br>be prepared to make concessions in any engagement, and would 
<br>need to offer "something real."  Li sugested starting with 
<br>demonstrating a position of "mutual respect." 
<br> 
<br>Iran Remains Suspicious of U.S. Intentions 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (C) Based on his conversations with Iranian 
<br>policy-makers, Li said, Iran remained suspicious of U.S. 
<br>intentions.  He suggested that dialogue with Iran should have 
<br>a "symbolic" beginning to avoid a false start.  He said that 
<br>the two sides should first agree on principles not directly 
<br>related to the nuclear issue.  He suggested that if the 
<br>Iranians show a willingness to suspend uranium enrichment, 
<br>the United States should be prepared to follow up immediately 
<br>with new cooperation.  He stressed that the Iranian 
<br>leadership regarded itself an important player on the 
<br>regional issues that concern the United States, especially 
<br>efforts to stabilize Iraq and Afghanistan. 
<br> 
<br>IRI Official: Nuclear Weapon Would Be "Disastrous" 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----- 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (C) Li reported that he was told by a Deputy Foreign 
<br>Minister in Tehran that Iran considers itself a regional 
<br>power, but understands that if Iran were to develop a nuclear 
<br>weapon, the United States would likely deploy nuclear weapons 
<br>to the Persian Gulf region, which would be "strategically 
<br>disastrous" for Iran.  He said that the official had told him 
<br>Iran wants to develop "nuclear capability" as a symbol of its 
<br>status as a regional power.  The official told Li that Iran 
<br>was nevertheless willing to open a dialogue with the United 
<br>States. 
<br> 
<br>Other Challenges to Opening a Dialogue 
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (C) Li said that the atmosphere had improved for 
<br>developing new engagement with Iran, but obstacles remained. 
<br> 
<br>BEIJING 00000560  003 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>The regime in Tehran continued to see opportunities for 
<br>changing Iran's engagement with the world under the new U.S. 
<br>administration, and there was debate in Iran on how best to 
<br>respond.  Serious debate among the Iranian people on the need 
<br>for a nuclear program had yet to take place, Li stressed, 
<br>although the notion of weaponizing the results of the nuclear 
<br>program continued to generate debate among the Iranian 
<br>leadership.  Li stressed that the Iranian leadership 
<br>continued to dismiss the notion of U.S. military action in 
<br>response to its ongoing nuclear development and was convinced 
<br>that suspension of uranium enrichment is not necessary for 
<br>starting a "new process" with the United States. 
<br> 
<br>Election Politics also a Factor 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (C) Li said that this year's presidential election in 
<br>Iran would be an important factor in the chances for 
<br>meaningful talks with the United States.  Noting that the 
<br>candidacy of former President Khatami posed the first real 
<br>challenge of the campaign to incumbent President Ahmadinejad, 
<br>Li stressed that Khatami would not have been able to announce 
<br>his candidacy without explicit approval from Supreme Leader 
<br>Ayatollah Khamenei.  Unlike previous elections, other 
<br>reformist candidates had since dropped out of the campaign, 
<br>Li said, improving Khatami's chances.  Still, the hard-liners 
<br>had acted to overcome their internal divisions in light of 
<br>the Khatami candidacy, and Ahmadinejad remained "likely" to 
<br>be re-elected.  Li argued that the top-level blessing of the 
<br>Khatami candidacy indicated that the Supreme Leader deems 
<br>Khatami reliable enough and would not expect bold reforms 
<br>even if Khatami were elected.  In the meantime, Li suggested, 
<br>Ahmadinejad might feel the need to demonstrate his hard-line 
<br>credentials in the run-up to the June election. 
<br> 
<br>PRC to Iran: Don't Take Economic Cooperation for Granted 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
<br> 
<br>¶14. (C) Li said that China continued to value development of 
<br>its economic ties with Iran in order to maintain economic 
<br>growth.  He noted that Chinese officials told their Iranian 
<br>counterparts that they are frustrated with the lack of 
<br>progress on the nuclear issue, progress which would create a 
<br>foundation for new investment in the energy sector. 
<br>According to Li, to prod the Iranians to show progress on the 
<br>nuclear issue, the Chinese had warned them not to take 
<br>China's economic interests in Iran for granted.  Furthermore, 
<br>China's dependence on Iranian energy is decreasing given 
<br>recent improvements in Sino-Saudi relations (as evidenced by 
<br>President Hu's recent travel there) and their potential to 
<br>bring about increased Chinese access to Saudi energy 
<br>supplies.
