<br>TAGS: PREL AE
<br>SUBJECT:  SCENESETTER FOR THE PRESIDENT'S MEETING WITH SHAYKH 
<br>MOHAMMED BIN ZAYED 
<br> 
<br>Classified by Ambassador Richard Olson, reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (C) Mr President:  Shaykh Mohammed bin Zayed is looking forward 
<br>to renewing your acquaintanceship, established during his 2006 call 
<br>on you. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br>MbZ - The Man 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (C) Shaykh Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, or MbZ in USG speak, is 
<br>the man who runs the United Arab Emirates.  Officially he is the 
<br>Crown Prince of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi (the most important 
<br>principality of the seven emirate confederation) and his only federal 
<br>title is Deputy Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces; in fact he is 
<br>the key decision maker on national security issues.  He will make 
<br>deferential noises about his "boss" (elder half-brother President 
<br>Khalifa, a distant and uncharismatic personage), but we assess that 
<br>he has authority in all matters except for final decisions on oil 
<br>policy and major state expenditures. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C) Aged 47, MbZ is a leader not just in the UAE, but more 
<br>broadly in the Middle East, where he is seen as a particularly 
<br>dynamic member of the generation succeeding the geriatric cases who 
<br>have dominated the region for decades.  He is a reformer, actively 
<br>seeking to improve the life of his citizens and the UAE's future 
<br>through better education and health care, and through economic 
<br>diversification, including investments in clean energy to prepare his 
<br>citizenry for a post-hydrocarbon future.  He is proud of the fact 
<br>that despite having had the option of life of privilege, he rose 
<br>through the ranks of the UAE Armed Forces, earning his wings as a 
<br>helicopter pilot and retains a common touch that appeals to Emiratis. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br>MbZ and the Bilateral Relationship 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (C) MbZ has staked his reputation, and his country's future, on 
<br>its relationship with the United States, especially since 1990, when 
<br>the UAE leadership saw that the United States was prepared to shed 
<br>blood in the interests of preserving international order and 
<br>stability in the Gulf.  Since that formative experience, MbZ has 
<br>built armed forces (especially his Air Force) that are closely 
<br>aligned with the US.  He is also a proponent of close economic, 
<br>commercial, and where possible political ties with the US.  He has 
<br>generally tried to support us where he thinks we have been right 
<br>(Afghanistan), but also where he thinks we have pursued misguided 
<br>policies (Iraq).  MbZ recognizes that partnership with the US is 
<br>fundamental to the UAE's continued success, but he also knows that 
<br>the relationship is controversial among his people, and that if the 
<br>US is perceived as an unreliable protector, his own power base will 
<br>erode. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br>Iran 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (C) MbZ sees Iran as the primary external threat to the UAE and 
<br>his regime.  To his eyes, Tehran's threatening rhetoric, dominance by 
<br>proxy, and pursuit of nuclear weapons is reminiscent of Saddam in 
<br>¶1990.  Moreover, the confrontations with Iran during the late 1980s 
<br>tanker wars, long forgotten in the West, are vividly remembered here. 
<br> MbZ is probably the most passionately anti-Iran of the Arab leaders, 
<br>and the UAE's position is solidly with Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan 
<br>in seeing the principal threat to the region as coming from Iran. 
<br>MbZ is particularly concerned at the divisions among the Gulf Arabs, 
<br>and sees Qatar's and Oman's decision to accommodate, rather than 
<br>challenge, Iranian power as troubling. 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (S/NF) While MbZ is a hard liner on Iran, there are 
<br>accommodationists within his own system, especially in Dubai, where 
<br>the Ruler, Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum (Prime Minister of the UAE) 
<br>takes a position that is much closer to Qatar's.  For this reason, 
<br>and because of the basic disparity in size and power between the UAE 
<br>and Iran, the Emiratis prefer to be seen as quietly supporting a 
<br>hard-line US position, rather than staking out their own views.  MbZ 
<br>is skeptical that US engagement with Iran will be successful in 
<br>reversing Iranian positions on nuclear program, and believes that a 
<br>policy of engagement puts him in an awkward position, both 
<br>domestically and internationally.  He will welcome thinking on next 
<br>steps on sanctions. 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (S/NF) Regarding the nuclear issue, MbZ believes that the logic 
<br>of war now dominates the region.  He regularly expresses his belief 
<br>that Israel will launch a pre-emptive strike against Iranian nuclear 
<br>facilities, most likely within next six months.  This reflects his 
<br>own assessment of the Netanyahu Government, but also, probably, what 
<br>Israelis are telling UAE in their private exchanges.  For this 
<br>reason, one of MbZ's highest priorities is to finalize his integrated 
<br>air defense system (including THAAD and Patriots) and advance 
<br>bilateral contingency planning with the US.  Because of Qatari and 
<br>Omani wobbliness, he is uncomfortable with multilateral (GCC) 
<br>military solutions.  MbZ may float the idea of extending the US 
<br>nuclear umbrella to the Gulf as a way of shoring up an anti-Iran 
<br>coalition, and preventing a regional arms race. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br>Israel and the Arabs 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (S/NF) MbZ's pre-occupation with Iran (and his secondary concern 
<br>about Islamic fundamentalism) lead him to have a strategic view of 
<br>the region that is curiously close to the Israeli one.  But domestic 
<br>politics flow the other way, and he feels constrained in what he can 
<br>say publicly.  Also, for reasons that are not entirely clear, the UAE 
<br>still feels a need to hide behind Arab League and GCC consensus, and 
<br>in particular behind Saudi Arabia (even when, as is now the case, 
<br>bilateral relations with the Kingdom are rocky). 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (S/NF)  We should press MbZ to expend political capital in 
<br>resolving the century old Arab-Israeli conflict.  The issue cries out 
<br>for leadership in the Arab world, not least so that the common 
<br>interests of moderate Arabs and Israelis in containing Iran can find 
<br>a political expression.  So far, MbZ has not been prepared to run 
<br>real risks in this area, but we should press him to.  He appreciates 
<br>the bold steps you have taken, and expects to be asked for help in 
<br>this area. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br>Afghanistan-Pakistan 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (C) The discussion on Afghanistan and Pakistan should be an easy 
<br>one.  The UAE has played a useful role since 2001, having deployed 
<br>Special Forces there since 2003, and recently sending a Battalion 
<br>sized task force during the elections.  MbZ tried to organize a 
<br>pan-Arab force, but could not overcome the resistance of Moroccans 
<br>and Tunisians to send troops.  In Pakistan, the UAE has been 
<br>supportive of Zardari and played a very useful role both as donor and 
<br>politically as one of the key members of the friends of Pakistan 
<br>grouping.  MbZ agrees on the need to curtail Taliban financing, but 
<br>is frustrated by our seeming inability to generate actionable 
<br>intelligence. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br>CT/CP Cooperation 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (C) The UAE has emerged as one of our principal partners in CT 
<br>Cooperation through intelligence channels, having rounded up a number 
<br>of cells over the past few years, and is moving toward cooperation 
<br>externally as well.  In the counterproliferation area, the UAE has 
<br>interdicted 20 shipments over the past two years, including within 
<br>the past few days, seizing North Korean systems bound for Iran. 
<br>Domestic Export Controls have lagged somewhat, but the UAEG's 
<br>bureaucratic structure for implementing its export control laws is 
<br>finally emerging. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br>Conclusion 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br> 
<br>¶12.  (C) MbZ views himself as one our closest partners in the Middle 
<br>East, and is keen to build on what has been an important aspect of 
<br>his life's work, a good relationship with the US.  From my 
<br>perspective, our relationship with the UAE is one the most promising 
<br>and productive in the region.
