<br>SUBJECT: EXISTENCE OF A COVERT URANIUM ENRICHMENT 
<br>FACILITY IN IRAN 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (U) This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 
<br>3 for action. 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (SBU) BACKGROUND:  The United States is aware that 
<br>Iran has been secretly building another enrichment 
<br>facility, in addition to the one at Natanz.  Some other 
<br>governments are also in possession of similar 
<br>information.  The United States, France, and the United 
<br>Kingdom briefed the IAEA on Thursday, 24 September on 
<br>this facility.  The United States remains committed to a 
<br>diplomatic resolution of international concerns with 
<br>Iran's nuclear program.  These concerns are reinforced 
<br>by the existence of this facility.  Immediate, 
<br>unconditional cooperation by Iran with the IAEA is 
<br>essential to address these concerns and to ensure that a 
<br>diplomatic process has a chance to succeed. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (U) ACTION REQUEST:  Posts are requested to inform 
<br>senior host government officials of the existence of a 
<br>covert uranium enrichment facility in Iran using the 
<br>points contained in paragraph 4.  Posts are NOT 
<br>authorized to provide a copy of the points.  Washington 
<br>understands that, in a previous iteration of this 
<br>message, a non-paper was authorized.  If points have 
<br>already been conveyed in writing, posts are instructed 
<br>to request discretion on the part of host government 
<br>interlocutors.  If asked about coincidental claims by an 
<br>Iranian exile group of previously unknown nuclear 
<br>weaponization sites, posts should convey the following, 
<br>IC-cleared point: 
<br> 
<br>-- We do not believe that these other sites that you 
<br>refer to are the Qom enrichment site.  There are many 
<br>suspect sites, including these others, that we monitor. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (U) BEGIN TALKING POINTS: 
<br> 
<br>-- We have acquired substantial, specific information 
<br>that Iran has been secretly building another enrichment 
<br>facility ? in addition to Natanz. 
<br> 
<br>-- The facility is located near the city of Qom, Iran, 
<br>and has been under construction for several years.  The 
<br>facility is located in an underground tunnel complex on 
<br>the grounds of an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps 
<br>Base. 
<br> 
<br>-- Earlier this year, we developed information that gave 
<br>us increased confidence that the facility was a uranium 
<br>enrichment site. 
<br> 
<br>-- The site is under the management of the Atomic Energy 
<br>Organization of Iran, but unknown to all but the most 
<br>senior AEOI officials. 
<br> 
<br>-- The site is intended to hold approximately 3000 
<br>centrifuges but we do not know what type of centrifuge 
<br>Iran intends to employ there.  We assess an enrichment 
<br>plant containing 3000 centrifuges is not adequate to 
<br>produce regular fuel reloads for civilian nuclear power 
<br>plants, which require a much larger number of 
<br>centrifuges. 
<br> 
<br>-- Based on our understanding of the status of the 
<br>facility, we assess that Iran will not be able to begin 
<br>enriching uranium there before at least 2010.  Iran is 
<br>continuing construction of support buildings at the 
<br>facility.  Intelligence indicates that earlier this 
<br>year, Iran was installing the infrastructure required 
<br>for centrifuges. 
<br> 
<br>-- Iran may claim that this facility is for civilian 
<br>nuclear fuel production.  The Iranian government 
<br>continues to claim that it is not pursuing a nuclear 
<br>weapon.  Yet this facility is too small to be viable for 
<br>production of fuel for a nuclear power reactor.  It may 
<br>be well-suited, however, for a military purpose. 
<br> 
<br>-- We are aware that some other governments are in 
<br>possession of similar information. 
<br> 
<br>-- We learned this week that Iran has sent the IAEA a 
<br>letter indicating that it is constructing a pilot fuel 
<br>enrichment facility and that the "required 
<br>infrastructure has been established." 
<br> 
<br>-- The letter provides no details and states that 
<br> 
<br>STATE 00100153  002 OF 002 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>"further complementary information will be provided in 
<br>an appropriate and due time." We assume this new 
<br>enrichment facility is the facility that we and other 
<br>governments have been tracking. 
<br> 
<br>-- We, the UK and France have briefed the IAEA on the 
<br>information that they have so that they can fully 
<br>investigate the facility.  The President, with his UK 
<br>and French counterparts, plans to make an announcement 
<br>Friday morning in Pittsburgh. 
<br> 
<br>-- We firmly believe that the existence of a new 
<br>centrifuge facility in Iran constitutes a serious 
<br>violation of Iran's international obligations. 
<br> 
<br>-- Iran was required to suspend all uranium enrichment- 
<br>related activities in UN Security Council resolution 
<br>¶1737.  This legally-binding requirement has been 
<br>reaffirmed in three subsequent UNSC resolutions. 
<br> 
<br>-- When Iran decided to build this facility, it was 
<br>obligated to declare this to the IAEA.  It failed to do 
<br>so. 
<br> 
<br>-- What is clear is that Iran once again has engaged in 
<br>a deceit of the international community.   The President 
<br>made clear that we are serious about using diplomacy to 
<br>find a negotiated solution to the Iranian nuclear 
<br>program, but in order to do so, Iran needs to be 
<br>transparent and truthful. 
<br> 
<br>-- It is now time for Iran to prove to the international 
<br>community that it is willing to play by the rules.   We 
<br>urge your public support on this matter as we head into 
<br>the October 1 meeting with Iran. 
<br> 
<br>-- It will particularly important that Iran understand 
<br>that it must end the pattern of deception and once and 
<br>for all commit itself to full transparency.   It is time 
<br>for Iran to come clean on the questions about its 
<br>weaponization studies and to implement the Additional 
<br>Protocol. 
<br> 
<br>-- The Ministers of the P5+1 held a productive meeting 
<br>on the margins of the UN General Assembly.  They stated 
<br>their expectation that Iran will be prepared to take 
<br>constructive steps when it meets with the P5+1 on 
<br>October 1st.  In light of this new and troubling 
<br>information, the burden is clearly on Iran to prove the 
<br>exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear program.  It 
<br>is essential that Iran accept that the process in Geneva 
<br>must be real an address their nuclear program.  We are 
<br>prepared to engage in a real process but will not be a 
<br>party to a phony one. 
<br> 
<br>-- We hope that we can count on your public support for 
<br>holding Iran to its international obligations.
