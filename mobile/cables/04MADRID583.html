<br>SUBJECT: GUANTANAMO DETAINEES: SPANISH POLICE SEEK ACCESS
<br>
<br>Classified By: Charge J. Robert Manzanares per 1.5 (b) and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) The Spanish National Police (SNP) have officially
<br>requested via the Embassy that the USG authorize Spanish
<br>police access to interview two Guantanamo detainees. SNP
<br>seeks to develop information regarding the two detainees'
<br>training, recruitment and deployment into Afghanistan. The
<br>two detainees are:
<br>
<br>Omar Amer Deghayes, ISN US9LY-00727-DP (Libyan)
<br>Jamil Abdul Latif Elbanna, ISN US9JO-00905-DP (Palestinian)
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Judge Baltasar Garzon is leading the investigation
<br>into the al Qaeda cell arrested in Spain in November 2001.
<br>Garzon believes that cell leader Eddin Barakat Yarkas, aka
<br>Abu Dahdah, recruited these two individuals in Spain.
<br>Garzon has stressed to us that he faces tight deadlines for
<br>the prosecution of Barakat Yarkas and his cell members.
<br>Garzon has told us he must have all evidence in final form to
<br>present to the prosecutor no later than April 2004. For
<br>this reason, SNP investigators and Garzon stress that getting
<br>access to the above-named detainees as soon as possible is
<br>critical.
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) On February 13, the Spanish Council of Ministers
<br>approved Judge Garzon's request to seek the extradition to
<br>Spain from Guantanamo of Deghayes and Elbanna (and a third
<br>detainee, Lahcen Ikassrien, a Moroccan). This decision took
<br>place on the same day that the USG transferred a Spanish
<br>national Guantanamo detainee to Spanish custody for
<br>prosecution, under Garzon's direction, as a member of the al
<br>Qaeda cell and a recruit of Barakat Yarkas.
