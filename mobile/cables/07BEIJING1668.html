<br>Summary
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Vice Premier Wu Yi personally intervened in
<br>the case of Dr. Gao Yaojie in order to break an
<br>impasse between the Central Government and Henan
<br>Province authorities, xxxxx unusually
<br>candid comments, along with other observations from
<br>MFA staffers, reveal a glimpse into central-local
<br>dissonance and how tough political problems get solved
<br>in China. xxxxx complained that Provincial Party
<br>Secretaries are using their considerable clout to
<br>
<br>Sipdis
<br>increasingly weigh in with Central authorities on
<br>issues that affect foreign policy. In Dr. Gao's case,
<br>well-connected Henan Province Party Secretary Xu
<br>Guangchun wanted to prevent the doctor from publicly
<br>embarrassing the province, which would threaten Xu's
<br>own promotion prospects. In the end, only
<br>intervention from the highest levels of China's
<br>Government induced Henan authorities to relent.xxxxx
<br>officials stressed to us China's desire that Dr.
<br>Gao's visit to the United States not be "politicized."
<br>End Summary.
<br>
<br>Candid Talk in an Informal Setting
<br>----------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Vice Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi topped the
<br>cast of several dozen MFA attendees at the
<br>Ambassador's Lunar New Year dinner reception February
<br>¶28. Keen for insights into what prompted the policy
<br>switch whereby Henan Province authorities released Dr.
<br>Gao from house arrest, Poloffs asked MFA officers at
<br>various levels for their reading of how we reached the
<br>positive outcome. Dr. Gao arrived in New York
<br>February 26 and is scheduled to receive an award at a
<br>Vital Voices Global Partnership event in Washington on
<br>March 14. She has told the foreign press that
<br>intervention from high-level Central leaders (as well
<br>as international pressure) likely caused the local
<br>government in Henan Province to release her from house
<br>arrest and allow her to travel abroad.
<br>
<br>Henan Feels the Heat
<br>--------------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) xxxxx confirmed Dr. Gao's assertions,
<br>remarking that "top leaders" needed to get involved in
<br>order to overrule Henan Province Party Secretary Xu
<br>Guangchun, xxxxx acknowledged. (Note: Xu, the former
<br>head of the State Administration for Radio, Film and
<br>Television, is reported to have ties to President Hu
<br>Jintao. End note.) xxxxx complained that provincial
<br>Party secretaries have considerable clout and are
<br>increasingly weighing in with the Central Government
<br>on issues that affect foreign policy, diminishing the
<br>authority of the MFA in policymaking. Provincial
<br>leaders do not listen to the MFA, xxxxx commented.
<br>Such was the case with Dr. Gao. xxxxx said neither
<br>xxxxx VFM Yang
<br>Jiechi to EVFM Dai Bingguo to FM Li Zhaoxing -- had
<br>the bureaucratic muscle to fix the problem. Vice
<br>Premier Wu herself had to call the authorities in
<br>Henan and tell them to allow Dr. Gao to travel.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Henan officials, including Party Secretary Xu,
<br>were likely concerned that if Dr. Gao traveled to the
<br>United States, she would do or say something to
<br>embarrass the province, which in turn could harm the
<br>officials' potential for promotion, xxxxx commented.
<br>As a general rule these days, personal advancement is
<br>priority No. 1 for local leaders, regardless of their
<br>province. "They are most interested in their own
<br>political position," xxxxx complained. Provincial
<br>leaders do not think about the national interest and,
<br>currently, are focused mainly on making sure that
<br>"nothing bad happens" to dash their promotion
<br>prospects, he said.
<br>
<br>Wu Yi's Constant Calls
<br>----------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) xxxxx related that Vice Premier Wu Yi
<br>"ruined" his spring festival holiday break by calling
<br>him constantly for updates. After Henan officials
<br>released the doctor from house arrest on February 16,
<br>
<br>Beijing 00001668 002 of 002
<br>
<br>
<br>the case became even more challenging for the MFA
<br>because Central authorities were worried about Dr. Gao
<br>causing trouble in Beijing on her way to the United
<br>States. Would she hold a press conference? Would the
<br>media film her trip to the Embassy to pick up a visa?
<br>"We needed to follow the issue very closely," xxxxx
<br>related.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) The MFA was also concerned because "sensitive
<br>people" who might be tempted to "manipulate" the
<br>matter fastened themselves to Dr. Gao during her time
<br>in Beijing. "You know who these people are," xxxxx
<br>claimed. xxxxx
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Although we have no firm evidence, it appears
<br>probable that Senator Clinton's personal appeal via
<br>letter was a key catalyst behind Vice Premier Wu's
<br>intervention in the case.xxxxx
<br>told Poloff they thought the Senator's letter struck
<br>an appropriate tone. Regardless, Vice Premier Wu's
<br>involvement comes at a time when she is taking on a
<br>high-visibility role in United States-China relations.
<br>xxxxx told the DCM that the Vice Premier called him
<br>xxxxx. She gave xxxxx marching orders to
<br>present her and the Strategic Economic Dialogue in a
<br>proper light, he said. In addition, Vice Premier Wu
<br>took an unusually high-level Chinese delegation to
<br>Beijing airport March 7 to meet briefly with Treasury
<br>Secretary Paulson as he transited on the way to
<br>
<br>Sipdis
<br>Shanghai.
<br>
<br>Don't Politicize It
<br>-------------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Further on public aspects of Dr. Gao's case,
<br>MFA International Organizations Deputy Director
<br>General Chen Xu and Office of North American Affairs
<br>Counselor Deng Hongbo both emphasized that China hopes
<br>the doctor will not "politicize" her visit to the
<br>United States by making controversial comments casting
<br>Henan or China in an unflattering light. In response
<br>to Poloffs' observations, xxxxx
<br>at the reception acknowledged that Dr. Gao's transit
<br>was handled in a low-key way and that their worst
<br>fears were not realized during the doctor's Beijing
<br>stopover.
<br>
<br>Daring Daily Breaks Silence, Criticizes Locals
<br>--------------------------------------------- -
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Following her departure, Dr. Gao's travails
<br>were broached for the first time by China's own media.
<br>On February 26, the Southern Metropolitan Daily ran a
<br>daring editorial on the case that criticized "local
<br>and regional leaders" and called for greater openness
<br>about AIDS and other issues of public concern.
<br>However, the editorial has not been widely picked up
<br>on the Internet, and so far, the paper does not appear
<br>to have encountered any negative repercussions.
