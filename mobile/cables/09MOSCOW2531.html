<br>SUBJECT: MEDVEDEV, PUTIN, AND RUSSIA'S IRAN POLICY 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Ambassador John Beyrle for reasons 1.4 (b) 
<br>and (d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY:  Despite Russian President Medvedev's 
<br>September 24 remarks that sanctions against Iran might be 
<br>necessary, other government officials and experts here 
<br>caution that Russia will remain, for the time being, 
<br>reluctant to pursue a tougher line against Tehran.  The 
<br>consensus among the Russian political elite is that 
<br>maintaining a dialogue with the Iranians and exhausting 
<br>diplomatic avenues is preferable to imposing sanctions in the 
<br>near term.  While Medvedev as president is responsible for 
<br>controlling arms and nuclear technology transfers, Prime 
<br>Minister Putin remains closely identified with decisions on 
<br>Iran policy, including the sale of civilian nuclear 
<br>technology and weapons, which provides a boost to powerful 
<br>state enterprises.  According to Deputy FM Ryabkov, Putin's 
<br>relative silence on Iran since Medvedev's statements does not 
<br>signal any difference between them on sanctions.  End 
<br>Summary. 
<br> 
<br>Medvedev on Sanctions: Few Official Echoes 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) Russian Government officials, including Prime Minister 
<br>Putin, have not yet echoed President Medvedev's public 
<br>statement that Russia would consider the imposition of 
<br>sanctions on Iran if the world community ran out of other 
<br>options.  Asked about Russian views on the Qom revelation in 
<br>New York September 25, FM Lavrov adopted a strikingly softer 
<br>tone than in the just released Kremlin statement.  He noted 
<br>that Iran had acted positively by notifying the IAEA about 
<br>its plans to construct a new nuclear facility, and complained 
<br>that some of Russia's "partner countries" in the P5-plus-1 
<br>had not shared information about the Qom facility earlier. 
<br>Lavrov stressed that Iran's cooperation with the world 
<br>community as a member of the NPT with non-nuclear status 
<br>could prove the peaceful nature of its nuclear program. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) Before the most recent P5-plus-1 meeting in Geneva, PM 
<br> Putin said that Russia would not support "significant" 
<br>changes to its approach on Iran.  Ariel Cohen, a senior 
<br>fellow at the Heritage Foundation, said Putin and Lavrov told 
<br>him in early September that they are opposed to tougher 
<br>sanctions and the use of force against Iran.  Russian Deputy 
<br>Foreign Minster Sergei Ryabkov said September 29 that Iran's 
<br>recent proposals presented a "broad field for dialogue." 
<br>Ryabkov added that whether sanctions against Iran might 
<br>become inevitable was a "completely separate issue, one that 
<br>we are not yet ready to address."  He stressed Russia's 
<br>position was to do everything possible to find a "diplomatic, 
<br>political solution to the Iranian nuclear problem." 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (SBU) While expressing concern over Iran's missile 
<br>program, Russian Ambassador to NATO Dmitriy Rogozin stressed 
<br>September 29 that Russia preferred political dialogue over 
<br>tough measures that could trigger an "arms race in the 
<br>region."  Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergey 
<br>Kislyak said September 24 that sanctions were not the way to 
<br>resolve the problem; rather, the point was how to find a 
<br>"political solution that would eliminate this problem."  The 
<br>priority was to "start a serious dialogue with our Iranian 
<br>partners in seeking a way out of the situation." 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) Russia's message to domestic audiences also remains 
<br>unchanged.  Despite Medvedev's carefully worded comments on 
<br>sanctions in New York (called by one analyst here "a jewel of 
<br>diplomatic casuistry"), even prominent Russians with ties to 
<br>the Kremlin's domestic propaganda machine believe Russian 
<br>support for Western sanctions is highly unlikely.  Medvedev 
<br>advisor Gleb Pavlovskiy, President of the Effective Policy 
<br>Foundation, and Maksim Shevchenko, President of the Russian 
<br>World Foundation, even spoke in favor of completing Russia's 
<br>frozen S-300 surface-to-air missile deal with Iran. 
<br> 
<br>Interpreting Putin's Silence 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) PM Putin's lack of public comment on the possibility 
<br>of Iran sanctions after President Medvedev's public statement 
<br>does not indicate disagreement between them on Iran, DFM 
<br>Ryabkov told Ambassador Beyrle October 3.  Ryabkov repeated 
<br>his comments, made in Geneva during P5-plus-1 talks, that 
<br>Russia had not ruled out the possibility of sanctions, but 
<br>would begin to contemplate them only as an absolute last 
<br>resort. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) Most political commentators and analysts here have 
<br>been echoing the same statements.  Tatyana Stanovaya of the 
<br>Center for Political Technologies thought that Medvedev's 
<br>seemingly more positive statement indicates no real 
<br>rapprochement with the U.S. on Iran.  Rather, she said, his 
<br>words are carefully calibrated to indicate a welcoming of 
<br>U.S. willingness to use the P5-plus-1 format and engage in 
<br>actual discussions with Iranian officials. 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (C) Nevertheless, Medvedev's New York comments and the 
<br>September 25 Kremlin statement mark a definite toughening of 
<br>Russian rhetoric on Iran.  Pravoe Delo co-Chairman Georgiy 
<br>Bovt told us October 5 that Medvedev's use of the word 
<br>"sanctions" represents a policy change.  Boyt cautioned that 
<br>Medvedev's words would probably resonate with only a distinct 
<br>minority of Russian society.  He believes it will be hard for 
<br>Medvedev to sell Iran sanctions to the Russian bureaucracy 
<br>without the full support of Putin.  At the Sochi Economic 
<br>Forum, Putin blasted the U.S. for not allowing the export of 
<br>certain high technology to Russia.  Boyt thinks Russia might 
<br>ask for an easing of these restrictions in exchange for 
<br>supporting sanctions. 
<br> 
<br>Sanctions: Economic Implications 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C) Despite Medvedev's presidential authority over arms 
<br>transfers, Putin undoubtedly retains a critical, if not 
<br>decisive role over an issue with such significant domestic 
<br>economic implications as the transfer of nuclear technology 
<br>and armaments to Iran.  Russia and Iran currently have 
<br>limited military cooperation, so the effect of any lost 
<br>revenue from arms sales to Iran would be small.  While the 
<br>sale of S-300s to Iran, for example, would only net Russia 
<br>from USD 750 million to USD one billion, future military 
<br>sales could be considerably larger. 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (C) Several years ago Iran was a stable source of hard 
<br>currency and this cash flow helped Russia preserve its 
<br>nuclear construction sector.  The importance of Russia's 
<br>trade with Iran has decreased, but Russian exports to Iran 
<br>last year still exceeded USD 3 billion.  In the currently 
<br>depressed Russian economy, that is not an insignificant 
<br>amount.  In addition, great potential for future economic 
<br>gain to Russia exists via civilian nuclear technology sales 
<br>and increased military cooperation. 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (C) As the world's largest exporter of oil and gas, 
<br>Russia also benefits significantly from the "instability 
<br>premium" embedded in world oil prices due to tensions with 
<br>Iran.  Even a USD 5 per barrel instability premium would net 
<br>Russia almost USD 9 billion per year for oil and 
<br>approximately USD 2-4 billion from its gas exports.  Finally, 
<br>given Iran's position as the second largest owner of gas 
<br>reserves, Russia's gas sector clearly benefits from the lack 
<br>of international investment in the development of Iran's 
<br>natural gas sector. 
<br> 
<br>Life without Iran 
<br>----------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (C) Russia could profit from alternatives to its 
<br>continued support for Iran.  For example, news reports 
<br>indicate that Saudi Arabia has offered to purchase the 
<br>Russian S-400 system for USD two billion in an effort to 
<br>force Moscow to back out of the S-300 deal with Iran. 
<br>Medvedev cited Arab League concerns about Russia's close 
<br>relationship with Iran when he stated that Russia's stance on 
<br>Iran might be changing. 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (C) Israel also is clearly pushing Russia to take a 
<br>firmer stance towards Tehran, in light of recent press 
<br>reports that PM Netanyahu personally delivered a list of 
<br>Russian scientists who contributed to Iran's nuclear program. 
<br> Conversations with Israeli diplomats in Moscow indicate that 
<br>Israel believes there may be even more to Iran's program than 
<br>is now known to the GOR and Russian decision makers.  They 
<br>hint that Israeli disclosures on Russian participation could 
<br>force Moscow into taking a harder line. 
<br> 
<br>COMMENT 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶14. (C) Success in moving Russia to support tougher actions 
<br>against Iran will require a coordinated strategy involving 
<br>our friends and allies, including Israel and Saudi Arabia. 
<br>The strategy may need to include the continuation of 
<br>diplomatic efforts like the P5-plus-1 process and perhaps 
<br>include new ways of engaging in dialogue with Iran.  A 
<br>strategy created by a broad international consensus must 
<br>offer Moscow a series of options that will challenge the 
<br>stubborn mentality here that instinctively opposes common 
<br>cause with the West on Iran.  Sanctions would have a major 
<br>impact on the Russian economy, and especially to the domestic 
<br>constituencies like RosOboronexport and RosAtom.  The fact 
<br>that the economy and these key state-controlled enterprises 
<br>are part of Putin's portfolio only reinforces the certainty 
<br>that he will remain the key decision maker on any imposition 
<br>of sanctions.  Key to the GOR's calculations would be any 
<br>politically salable alternatives that benefit them both 
<br>economically and politically.  End comment.
