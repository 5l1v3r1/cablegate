<br>
<br>REF: A. CAIRO 671 
<br>¶B. CAIRO 974 
<br>¶C. 2006 CAIRO 2010 
<br>
<br>CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR FRANCIS J. RICCIARDONE, 
<br>FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION: PRESIDENTIAL SUCCESSION IS 
<br>THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM OF EGYPTIAN POLITICS. DESPITE 
<br>INCESSANT WHISPERED DISCUSSIONS, NO ONE IN EGYPT HAS ANY 
<br>CERTAINTY ABOUT WHO WILL SUCCEED MUBARAK, OR HOW THE 
<br>SUCCESSION WILL HAPPEN. MUBARAK HIMSELF SEEMS TO BE TRUSTING 
<br>TO GOD AND THE INERTIA OF THE MILITARY AND CIVILIAN SECURITY 
<br>SERVICES TO ENSURE AN ORDERLY TRANSITION. IN THE CURRENT 
<br>POLITICAL FRAMEWORK, THE MOST LIKELY CONTENDERS ARE 
<br>PRESIDENTIAL SON GAMAL MUBARAK (WHOSE PROFILE IS 
<br>EVER-INCREASING AT THE RULING NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY), 
<br>EGIS CHIEF OMAR SOLIMAN, DARK HORSE ARAB LEAGUE SECRETARY 
<br>GENERAL AMRE MOUSSA, OR AN AS-YET UNKNOWN MILITARY OFFICER. 
<br>WHOEVER ENDS UP AS EGYPT'S NEXT PRESIDENT LIKELY WILL BE 
<br>POLITICALLY WEAKER THAN MUBARAK. ONCE MUBARAK'S SUCCESSOR 
<br>HAS ASSUMED THE POST, HIS FIRST PRIORITY WILL BE TO BUILD 
<br>POPULAR SUPPORT. WE THUS EXPECT THAT THE NEW PRESIDENT WILL 
<br>LIKELY ADOPT AN ANTI-AMERICAN TONE IN HIS INITIAL PUBLIC 
<br>RHETORIC, IN AN EFFORT TO PROVE HIS NATIONALIST BONA FIDES TO 
<br>THE EGYPTIAN STREET, AND MAY POSSIBLY EXTEND AN OLIVE BRANCH 
<br>TO THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, AS DID PREVIOUS EGYPTIAN 
<br>PRESIDENTS AT THE BEGINNING OF THEIR TERMS. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>------------------------------ 
<br>LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR SUCCESSION 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) PRESIDENT MUBARAK IS FOND OF OBSERVING THAT NO ONE 
<br>SHOULD HAVE ANY QUALMS REGARDING HIS SUCCESSION, SINCE 
<br>EGYPT'S CONSTITUTION PROVIDES A DETAILED GUIDE FOR HOW A 
<br>SUCCESSION SHOULD PROCEED. AMONG THE RECENT CONSTITUTIONAL 
<br>AMENDMENTS WAS A NOTABLE CHANGE TO THE ARTICLE DETERMINING 
<br>WHICH OFFICIAL ASSUMES POWER IN THE EVENT OF THE TEMPORARY 
<br>INCAPACITATION OF THE PRESIDENT. ARTICLE 82, WHICH 
<br>PREVIOUSLY DELINEATED THAT THE VICE-PRESIDENT SHOULD ASSUME 
<br>PRESIDENTIAL POWERS "IF ON ACCOUNT OF ANY TEMPORARY OBSTACLE 
<br>THE PRESIDENT IS UNABLE TO CARRY OUT HIS DUTIES," HAS BEEN 
<br>AMENDED SO THAT, IF THERE IS NO VICE-PRESIDENT, THE PRIME 
<br>MINISTER IS ASSIGNED PRESIDENTIAL POWERS. ARTICLE 84 READS, 
<br>"IN CASE OF THE VACANCY OF THE PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE OR THE 
<br>PERMANENT DISABILITY OF THE PRESIDENT," THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
<br>PEOPLE'S ASSEMBLY (PA) OR THE PRESIDENT OF THE SUPREME 
<br>CONSTITUTIONAL COURT SHOULD TEMPORARILY ASSUME THE 
<br>PRESIDENCY. NEITHER WOULD SUBSEQUENTLY BE ALLOWED TO 
<br>NOMINATE HIMSELF FOR THE PRESIDENCY; THERE IS NO SUCH 
<br>STIPULATION AGAINST THE PM RUNNING FOR THE OFFICE. ARTICLE 
<br>84 GOES ON TO STIPULATE THAT, "THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC 
<br>SHALL BE CHOSEN WITHIN A MAXIMUM PERIOD OF 60 DAYS FROM THE 
<br>DAY OF THE VACANCY OF THE PRESIDENCY." 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) CONSTITUTIONAL ARTICLE 76, WHICH PREVIOUSLY WIRED THE 
<br>EGYPTIAN ELECTORAL FRAMEWORK TO GUARANTEE THE PRESIDENCY TO 
<br>THE RULING NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY (NDP), WAS ALSO AMONG 
<br>THE ARTICLES AMENDED IN APRIL (REF A). THE CHANGE WILL 
<br>OSTENSIBLY FACILITATE MORE COMPETITIVE PRESIDENTIAL 
<br>ELECTIONS, WHILE STILL PROTECTING AGAINST ANY SERIOUS 
<br>CHALLENGE TO THE NDP CANDIDATE. UNDER THE REVISIONS TO 
<br>ARTICLE 76, FOR AN INTERIM 10-YEAR PERIOD (I.E. UNTIL 2017), 
<br>LEGAL POLITICAL PARTIES WHICH HOLD AN ELECTED SEAT IN THE 
<br>PEOPLE'S ASSEMBLY OR SHURA COUNCIL CAN NOMINATE A 
<br>PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE (CURRENTLY, ONLY FOUR PARTIES MEET 
<br>THIS REQUIREMENT - THE NDP, AL GHAD, AL WAFD, AND TAGGAMU). 
<br>FOLLOWING THE INTERIM PERIOD, IN ORDER TO RUN A PRESIDENTIAL 
<br>CANDIDATE: 
<br>
<br>-- A PARTY HAS TO HAVE BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR AT LEAST 5 YEARS 
<br>PRIOR TO THE ELECTION; 
<br>
<br>-- ITS CANDIDATE MUST HAVE BEEN A MEMBER OF THE HIGHEST 
<br>LEADERSHIP BODY OF THE PARTY FOR AT LEAST 1 YEAR; AND, 
<br>
<br>-- THE PARTY WOULD HAVE TO HOLD AT LEAST 3% OF THE SEATS IN 
<br>BOTH PARLIAMENTARY HOUSES (I.E., 14 SEATS IN THE PEOPLE'S 
<br>ASSEMBLY, AND 6 SEATS IN THE SHURA COUNCIL), OR 6% OF THE 
<br>SEATS 
<br>IN EITHER THE PA OR SHURA COUNCIL). 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) GENUINELY INDEPENDENT CANDIDATES FACE AN ALMOST 
<br>IMPOSSIBLE BAR TO ENTER THE RACE. TO COMPETE IN THE NEXT 
<br>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, ARTICLE 76 STATES THAT AN 
<br>"INDEPENDENT" MUST OBTAIN ENDORSEMENTS FROM 250 ELECTED 
<br>MEMBERS OF EGYPT'S NATIONAL AND LOCAL REPRESENTATIVE BODIES, 
<br>OF WHICH THERE MUST BE A MINIMUM OF 65 ENDORSEMENTS FROM 
<br>MEMBERS OF THE PEOPLES ASSEMBLY, 25 FROM THE SHURA COUNCIL, 
<br>AND 10 FROM LOCAL COUNCILS IN AT LEAST 14 GOVERNORATES. THIS 
<br>WOULD BE A NEAR UNATTAINABLE FEAT FOR A NON-NDP CANDIDATE TO 
<br>ACHIEVE, GIVEN THE RULING PARTY'S DOMINATION OF ALL EGYPTIAN 
<br>ELECTED BODIES. IN EFFECT, THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE 76 
<br>ACCOMPLISH TWO OBJECTIVES REGARDING INDEPENDENTS: THE RULING 
<br>PARTY CAN BLOCK THE EMERGENCE OF ANY GENUINELY "INDEPENDENT" 
<br>CANDIDATE, WHILE IT COULD THEORETICALLY REACH BEYOND THE 
<br>NDP'S TOP LEADERSHIP TO SELECT AN "INDEPENDENT" WHOM THE 
<br>RULING ELITE JUDGES WILL BEST PROTECT THEIR INTERESTS, 
<br>PROVIDED THE NDP RETAINS PARTY DISCIPLINE. 
<br>
<br>-------------------- 
<br>POTENTIAL CANDIDATES 
<br>-------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) PRESIDENT MUBARAK, WHO BEGAN HIS FIFTH 6-YEAR TERM IN 
<br>SEPTEMBER 2005, RECENTLY TURNED 79. THE NEXT PRESIDENTIAL 
<br>ELECTION IS DUE TO BE HELD IN 2011. BY THE TIME MUBARAK 
<br>SERVES HIS FULL TERM, THERE MAY BE OTHER CANDIDATES IN THE 
<br>WINGS, OR MUBARAK HIMSELF COULD CHOOSE TO RUN AGAIN FOR THE 
<br>PRESIDENCY. HE IS ON RECORD AS SAYING, IN A NOVEMBER 2006 
<br>SPEECH, THAT HE PLANNED TO REMAIN PRESIDENT "AS LONG AS I 
<br>HAVE A HEART THAT BEATS, AND BREATH IN MY BODY." BUT IF THE 
<br>SUCCESSION HAPPENED TOMORROW, EGYPTIAN PARLOR SPECULATION 
<br>FOCUSES ON THE FOLLOWING AS POSSIBLE SUCCESSORS. 
<br>
<br>GAMAL MUBARAK 
<br>------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) CAIRENE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM HOLDS THAT GAMAL WANTS THE 
<br>JOB, DESPITE HIS REPEATED DENIALS TO THE CONTRARY (REF B). 
<br>THE MOST RECENT SUCH ABJURATION WAS ON MAY 2, DURING AN 
<br>INTERVIEW WITH THE ORBIT SATELLITE TV CHANNEL, WHEN GAMAL 
<br>STATED THAT, "I DO NOT HAVE THE INTENTION AND AMBITION TO RUN 
<br>FOR PRESIDENT ... WHATEVER THE PARTY SAYS DOES NOT MATTER. I 
<br>AM NOT LOOKING FOR ANY EXECUTIVE POST." SUCH COY DEMURRALS 
<br>RING HOLLOW IN THE FACE OF HIS INCREASINGLY ROBUST ROLE 
<br>WITHIN THE NDP (FAR EXCEEDING THAT OF HIS COUNTERPARTS IN THE 
<br>PARTY HIERARCHY), HIS APPARENTLY CENTRAL ROLE IN CREATING NEW 
<br>LEGISLATION, AND HIS RECENT TOURS TO VARIOUS GOVERNORATES 
<br>FEATURING MINISTERIAL ENTOURAGES. IT IS HARD TO ARGUE THAT 
<br>GAMAL IS NOT BEING GROOMED FOR THE PRESIDENCY. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) MANY IN THE EGYPTIAN ELITE SEE HIS SUCCESSION AS 
<br>POSITIVE, AS HIS LIKELY CONTINUATION OF THE CURRENT STATUS 
<br>QUO WOULD SERVE THEIR BUSINESS AND POLITICAL INTERESTS. 
<br>GIVEN THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CANDIDACY, AND WEAK 
<br>OPPOSITION LEADERSHIP, THERE ARE CURRENTLY FEW OTHER EGYPTIAN 
<br>PERSONALITIES WITH THE NATIONAL STATURE AND POLITICAL CAPITAL 
<br>TO SERIOUSLY CONTEND FOR THE PRESIDENCY. LIKEWISE, DUE TO 
<br>THE PARANOIA OF THE EGYPTIAN DICTATORSHIP, NO OTHER NAME CAN 
<br>SAFELY OR RESPECTFULLY BE BRUITED AS A CONTENDER. WHILE THE 
<br>PRESIDENT'S SON IS VULNERABLE TO OPEN CRITICISM FOR HIS 
<br>PRESUMED AMBITION, HE IS THE ONLY PERSON IN EGYPT WHOSE TOTAL 
<br>LOYALTY TO MUBARAK IS ALSO TAKEN FOR GRANTED, SO HIS IS THE 
<br>ONLY NAME THAT CAN POSSIBLY BE BANDIED ABOUT. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) A KEY STUMBLING BLOCK FOR A GAMAL CANDIDACY COULD BE 
<br>THE MILITARY. EACH OF EGYPT'S FOUR PRESIDENTS SINCE 1952 
<br>AROSE FROM THE OFFICER CORPS, AND THE MILITARY HAS 
<br>HISTORICALLY BEEN THE ULTIMATE GUARANTOR OF THE PRESIDENT'S 
<br>RULE. GAMAL DID NOT SERVE AS A MILITARY OFFICER, AND WE 
<br>BELIEVE HE DID NOT COMPLETE HIS COMPULSORY SERVICE. MANY 
<br>OBSERVERS OPINE THAT TIMING IS THE CRUCIAL FACTOR FOR A 
<br>POTENTIAL GAMAL PRESIDENCY - HIS POWER BASE IS HIS FATHER, 
<br>AND SO WHILE HE COULD CONCEIVABLY BE INSTALLED PRIOR TO 
<br>MUBARAK'S DEATH, THE TASK WOULD BECOME FAR MORE DIFFICULT, 
<br>ALTHOUGH NOT INSURMOUNTABLE, ONCE THE PHARAOH HAS DEPARTED 
<br>THE SCENE, AND PERSONAL LOYALTIES TO HIM ARE IN THE PAST. 
<br>ALTHOUGH THERE IS WIDESPREAD POPULAR ANIMUS AGAINST A GAMAL 
<br>CANDIDACY, WITH MANY EGYPTIANS OPINING PROUDLY THAT, "WE ARE 
<br>NOT SYRIA OR SAUDI!", THE NDP MACHINERY COULD LIKELY STAGE AN 
<br>ELECTORAL VICTORY, BASED ON POOR VOTER TURNOUT, SLOPPY VOTER 
<br>LISTS, AND STATE CONTROL OF THE ELECTION APPARATUS. 
<br>
<br>OMAR SOLIMAN 
<br>------------- 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) EGYPTIAN INTELLIGENCE CHIEF AND MUBARAK CONSIGLIERE, 
<br>IN PAST YEARS SOLIMAN WAS OFTEN CITED AS LIKELY TO BE NAMED 
<br>TO THE LONG-VACANT VICE-PRESIDENTIAL POST. IN THE PAST TWO 
<br>YEARS, SOLIMAN HAS STEPPED OUT OF THE SHADOWS, AND ALLOWED 
<br>HIMSELF TO BE PHOTOGRAPHED, AND HIS MEETINGS WITH FOREIGN 
<br>LEADERS REPORTED. MANY OF OUR CONTACTS BELIEVE THAT SOLIMAN, 
<br>BECAUSE OF HIS MILITARY BACKGROUND, WOULD AT THE LEAST HAVE 
<br>TO FIGURE IN ANY SUCCESSION SCENARIO FOR GAMAL, POSSIBLY AS A 
<br>TRANSITIONAL FIGURE. SOLIMAN HIMSELF ADAMANTLY DENIES ANY 
<br>PERSONAL AMBITIONS, BUT HIS INTEREST AND DEDICATION TO 
<br>NATIONAL SERVICE IS OBVIOUS. HIS LOYALTY TO MUBARAK SEEMS 
<br>ROCK-SOLID. AT AGE 71, HE COULD BE ATTRACTIVE TO THE RULING 
<br>APPARATUS AND THE PUBLIC AT LARGE AS A RELIABLE FIGURE 
<br>UNLIKELY TO HARBOR AMBITIONS FOR ANOTHER MULTI-DECADE 
<br>PRESIDENCY. A KEY UNANSWERED QUESTION IS HOW HE WOULD 
<br>RESPOND TO A GAMAL PRESIDENCY ONCE MUBARAK IS DEAD. AN 
<br>ALLEGED PERSONAL FRIEND OF SOLIMAN TELLS US THAT SOLIMAN 
<br>"DETESTS" THE IDEA OF GAMAL AS PRESIDENT, AND THAT HE ALSO 
<br>WAS "DEEPLY PERSONALLY HURT" BY MUBARAK, WHO PROMISED TO NAME 
<br>HIM VICE-PRESIDENT SEVERAL YEARS AGO, BUT THEN RENEGED. 
<br>
<br>AMRE MOUSSA 
<br>----------- 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) THE CHARISMATIC ARAB LEAGUE SECRETARY GENERAL 
<br>PRUDENTLY HAS NEVER INDICATED INTENTION OR AMBITION TO ENTER 
<br>INTO EGYPTS DOMESTIC POLITICAL FRAY, AND HAS NO EGYPTIAN 
<br>INSTITUTIONAL POLITICAL PLATFORM FROM WHICH TO SPRING. 
<br>HOWEVER, AS THE HIGH-PROFILE ELDER STATESMAN OF ARAB CAUSES, 
<br>HE ENJOYS CONSIDERABLE STREET CREDIBILITY, POPULARITY, AND 
<br>PERCEIVED GRAVITAS. IT IS FAR-FETCHED BUT CONCEIVABLE THAT, 
<br>IN A LEADERSHIP CRISIS FOLLOWING MUBARAK'S DEATH, MOUSSA 
<br>COULD EMERGE AS A PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDER, PROVIDED THAT HE IS 
<br>AN NDP MEMBER, OR IF THE NDP WERE TO PROMOTE HIM UNDER THE 
<br>CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS ALLOWED FOR INDEPENDENT CANDIDATES. 
<br>
<br>MILITARY OFFICER 
<br>---------------- 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) CURRENTLY, THERE IS NO OBVIOUS CONTENDER FROM AMONG 
<br>THE OFFICER CORPS, EGYPT'S TRADITIONAL PRESIDENTIAL 
<br>RECRUITMENT GROUNDS. MINISTER OF DEFENSE TANTAWI, A 
<br>CONTEMPORARY OF MUBARAK'S, APPEARS TO HARBOR NO POLITICAL 
<br>AMBITIONS. LIKE SOLIMAN, HE COULD PLAY A ROLE IN CLEARING 
<br>THE WAY FOR GAMAL, IF HE CALCULATES THAT IS IN THE BEST 
<br>INTERESTS OF THE COUNTRY; CONVERSELY, HE COULD ALSO BE A KEY 
<br>PLAYER IN PREVENTING GAMALS ASCENDANCE. WE HAVE HEARD SOME 
<br>LIMITED REPORTS OF TANTAWIS INCREASING FRUSTRATION AND 
<br>DISENCHANTMENT WITH GAMAL (REF B). IN THE EVENT OF A NATIONAL 
<br>LEADERSHIP CRISIS, IT IS NEAR INCONCEIVABLE THAT GIVEN 
<br>MUBARAK'S PERSONAL MANIPULATION OF THE OFFICE CORPS, THAT 
<br>ANOTHER MILITARY OFFICER COULD EMERGE FROM OBSCURITY TO 
<br>ASSERT HIMSELF AS A CANDIDATE. BUT TANTAWI AND HIS SENIOR 
<br>COTERIE ARE NOT NECESSARILY POPULAR AT MID AND LOWER RANKS, 
<br>SO THE POSSIBILITY OF A MID-20TH CENTURY STYLE COUP OF 
<br>COLONELS CANNOT BE ENTIRELY DISCOUNTED. 
<br>
<br>OPPOSITION MEMBER 
<br>----------------- 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) OF THE 10 PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDERS IN 2005, 
<br>SECOND-PLACE AL GHAD PARTY LEADER AYMAN NOUR IS CURRENTLY 
<br>SERVING A SEVEN-YEAR JAIL TERM, AND ACCORDING TO EGYPTIAN 
<br>LAW, WILL BE BANNED FROM PARTICIPATING IN EGYPTIAN POLITICAL 
<br>LIFE FOR SEVERAL YEARS FOLLOWING HIS RELEASE. THE 
<br>THIRD-PLACE FINISHER, AL WAFD PARTY CANDIDATE NO'MAN GOMAA, 
<br>LOST HIS PARTY POSITION FOLLOWING A VIOLENT AND 
<br>SCANDAL-RIDDEN LEADERSHIP STRUGGLE. THE OTHER EIGHT 
<br>CANDIDATES, MARGINAL FIGURES TO BEGIN WITH, HAVE FADED BACK 
<br>INTO TOTAL OBSCURITY. CURRENT AL WAFD LEADER MAHMOUD ABAZA 
<br>IS A TALENTED POLITICIAN, BUT AT THIS POINT, DOES NOT APPEAR 
<br>TO HAVE NATIONAL APPEAL OR ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY TO MOUNT A 
<br>SERIOUS ATTEMPT AT THE PRESIDENCY. 
<br>
<br>DARK HORSE AND ALSO RANS 
<br>------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) POPULAR REFORMIST MINISTER OF TRADE RACHID IS A 
<br>POTENTIAL CANDIDATE, THOUGH A DISTINCT DARK HORSE. 
<br>NONETHELESS, HE COMES FROM AN OLD AND RESPECTED FAMILY AND IS 
<br>SEEN BY MANY AS LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR EGYPT'S IMPRESSIVE 
<br>ECONOMIC GROWTH OF THE PAST THREE YEARS. INTERESTINGLY, THE 
<br>HEAD OF CAIRO'S LARGE AND INFLUENTIAL AMCHAM, WHO KNOWS 
<br>RACHID WELL, TOLD US THAT, AFTER NEGOTIATING THE 
<br>CONTROVERSIAL QIZ PROGRAM, THE MINISTER "REALLY NEEDS 
<br>MOVEMENT ON THE FTA FOR POLITICAL COVER," RAISING THE 
<br>QUESTION: POLITICAL COVER FOR WHAT? WHILE IT IS HIGHLY 
<br>UNLIKELY RACHID WOULD TAKE ON GAMAL HEAD-TO-HEAD, WE CANNOT 
<br>DISCOUNT THE POSSIBILITY THAT HE WILLPLAY A ROLE IN A 
<br>CARETAKER GOVERNMENT, AND MAY EENTUALLY EMERGE AS A LEADER. 
<br>
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) SAFWAT ELSHERIF (NDP SECRETARY GENERAL AND SHURA 
<br>COUNCIL PEAKER), MUFEED SHEHAB (NDP ASSISTANT SYG, AND 
<br>MINISTER OF STATE FOR LEGAL AND PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, AND 
<br>ZAKARIA AZMY (NDP ASSISTANT SYG AND MUBARA'S DE FACTO CHIEF 
<br>OF STAFF) ALL, AS SENIOR LEADES OF THE NDP, MEET THE 
<br>CONSTITUTIONAL CRITERIA T RUN FOR OFFICE. NONE OF THESE 
<br>GRIZZLED NDP VETERANS HAVE PUBLICLY EXPRESSED PRESIDENTIAL 
<br>ASPIRATONS, NOR DO THEY APPEAR TO POSSESS ANY CAPABILITIE 
<br>TO GOVERN, NOR PERSONAL CONSTITUENCIES. HOWEVE, WHILE 
<br>UNLIKELY, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT, ONCE MUBAAK PERE IS OUT OF 
<br>THE PICTURE, ONE OF THEM COULD EMERGE IN AN ANTI-GAMAL PARTY 
<br>PUTSCH. FURTHERMORE. MOST ANALYSTS HERE BELIEVE THAT ANY 
<br>GOVERNOR PUSHING FOR THE PRESIDENCY IS A FAR-FETCHED 
<br>POSSIBILITY - THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF GOVERNORS ARE 
<br>FORMER SENIOR MILITARY AND POLICE OFFICERS CHOSEN FOR THEIR 
<br>LOYALTY, FAR FROM THE CRITICAL POLITICAL FRAY IN CAIRO, AND 
<br>WITH NO POWER BASES. 
<br>
<br>MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD 
<br>------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) WHILE THE SPECTER OF AN MB PRESIDENCY HAUNTS SECULAR 
<br>EGYPTIANS, IT IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY IN THE IMMEDIATE 
<br>POST-MUBARAK PERIOD. UNDER THE CURRENT LEGAL FRAMEWORK, THE 
<br>MB HAS NO ABILITY TO PUT FORWARD A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN 
<br>THE EVENT OF AN ELECTION. THE ORGANIZATION DOES NOT APPEAR 
<br>TO HAVE THE ORGANIZED MILITARY WING NECESSARY SHOULD IT WISH 
<br>TO ATTEMPT TO SEIZE THE PRESIDENCY BY FORCE. CONSTANT 
<br>OVERSIGHT OF THE ARMED FORCES AIMED AT ROOTING OUT POTENTIAL 
<br>ISLAMIST SYMPATHIZERS MEANS THAT FEW LIKELY REMAIN, ALTHOUGH 
<br>THE POSSIBILITY DOES EXIST THAT SOME CLOSE-MOUTHED MB-LEANING 
<br>OFFICERS ARE PRESENT. OVERALL, IN THE VIEW OF MOST EGYPTIAN 
<br>ANALYSTS, THE GROUP'S APPROACH SEEMS TO BE ONE OF PATIENCE 
<br>AND GRASS ROOTS BUILDING OF SUPPORT, WAITING FOR THE DAY WHEN 
<br>IT MIGHT COME TO POWER THROUGH POPULAR ELECTION, OR BY 
<br>POPULAR DEMAND AFTER A GAMAL PRESIDENCY HAS FOUNDERED. 
<br>
<br>------------------------ 
<br>POST-SUCCESSION DYNAMICS 
<br>------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) WHOEVER EGYPT'S NEXT PRESIDENT IS, HE WILL INEVITABLY 
<br>BE POLITICALLY WEAKER THAN MUBARAK, AND ONCE HE HAS ASSUMED 
<br>THE POST, AMONG HIS FIRST PRIORITIES WILL BE TO CEMENT HIS 
<br>POSITION AND BUILD POPULAR SUPPORT. WE CAN THUS ANTICIPATE 
<br>THAT THE NEW PRESIDENT MAY SOUND AN INITIAL ANTI-AMERICAN 
<br>TONE IN HIS PUBLIC RHETORIC, IN AN EFFORT TO PROVE HIS 
<br>NATIONALIST BONA FIDES TO THE EGYPTIAN STREET, AND DISTANCE 
<br>HIMSELF FROM MUBARAK'S POLICIES. IF HISTORY IS ANY GUIDE, WE 
<br>CAN ALSO EXPECT THE NEW PRESIDENT TO EXTEND AN OLIVE BRANCH 
<br>TO THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, AS DID GAMAL ABDEL NASSER, ANWAR 
<br>EL SADAT, AND MUBARAK EARLY IN ALL OF THEIR TERMS, IN AN 
<br>EFFORT TO CO-OPT POTENTIAL OPPOSITION, AND BOOST POPULARITY.
