<br> 
<br>¶1. (S/NF) SUMMARY:  Secretary of Defense Robert Gates (SecDef) was 
<br>hosted by French Minister of Defense Herve Morin for a working lunch 
<br>during an official bilateral visit to Paris on February 8, 2010. 
<br>SecDef and Morin agreed on the basic themes to be included in NATO's 
<br>revised Strategic Concept.  On Missile Defense, SecDef refuted Morin's 
<br>contention that a European Missile Defense system is both unwise and 
<br>unnecessary but pledged to give France and other Allies better 
<br>information on the costs and command and control structure of the U.S. 
<br>proposal.  Both Morin and Gates agreed that Iran's rejection of an 
<br>engagement track meant that the time for pressure had arrived, but both 
<br>noted concern over China's opposition to a new UN Security Council 
<br>Resolution (UNSCR).  On Afghanistan, SecDef praised French 
<br>contributions and highlighted ongoing trainer shortfalls.  SecDef 
<br>raised U.S. concerns over the sale of a Mistral-class helicopter 
<br>carrier to Russia as sending a mixed signal to both Russia and our 
<br>Central and East European Allies.  Morin refuted this idea, arguing 
<br>that the sale was a way to send a message of partnership to Russia at a 
<br>critical time.  Morin requested that the upcoming U.S. Air Force 
<br>Request for Proposal (RFP) for a new in-flight refueling tanker 
<br>aircraft be unbiased.  SecDef told Morin that he had full confidence 
<br>that the RFP would be as fair as possible.   END SUMMARY. 
<br> 
<br>---------------------- 
<br>NATO Strategic Concept 
<br>---------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S/NF) Morin welcomed SecDef to France and asked about U.S positions 
<br>regarding the revised NATO Strategic Concept.  Morin noted France's 
<br>interest in a document that would inject new ideas, be adopted with 
<br>great momentum, and define NATO's roles and missions. It should not 
<br>just be a restatement of the conventional wisdom. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S/NF) SecDef told Morin he favored a short document that was 
<br>perhaps three to five pages in length.  The Strategic Concept should 
<br>move NATO from a traditional defensive alliance to a security alliance 
<br>that can address a wide range of global threats.  SecDef said that the 
<br>Strategic Concept must better align resources with NATO's level of 
<br>ambition; it must lay out a comprehensive approach to civil-military 
<br>cooperation and enhance partnerships with the EU, UN and other 
<br>international organizations.  SecDef concluded that, above all, 
<br>financial and broader structural reform must be pursued -- either as 
<br>part of the Strategic Concept or in parallel. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (S/NF) Morin agreed on length and the need for NATO to take on new 
<br>missions, but he wondered what types of missions members had in mind. 
<br>Cyber attacks?  Terrorism?  Proliferation?  Missile Defense?  Morin 
<br>also stated his belief that NATO needed to bring some clarity to its 
<br>area of operation so that NATO did not end up extending to the Pacific. 
<br> He added that, in his view, extending the Alliance to Georgia would 
<br>weaken Article 5.  SecDef stated his preference for NATO to focus its 
<br>efforts in the Euro-Atlantic area, perhaps extending into the 
<br>Mediterranean.  He concurred with Morin that a bigger Alliance posed 
<br>challenges. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (S//NF) Morin told SecDef that the UK MoD had proposed drafting a 
<br>joint French-UK proposal on NATO reform to then present to the U.S. 
<br>Noting that the objective was to overcome blockages from those 
<br>countries that had underwhelming General Staffs, Morin asked whether 
<br>SecDef thought it would be better for Europe to build consensus at home 
<br>and work its own ideas, or for Europe and the United States to develop 
<br>joint proposals.  SecDef replied that he thought it best not to have 
<br>two proposals, but that he would consult with SecState.  He also said 
<br>he hoped that the Senior Officials Group would come up with some 
<br>concrete and viable ideas for reform. 
<br> 
<br>--------------- 
<br>Missile Defense 
<br>--------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (S/NF) Morin, having expressed strong reservations to new U.S. and 
<br>NATO missile defense (MD) plans at the NATO ministerial in Istanbul 
<br>(reftel), said he wanted to explain how France sees MD and raise some 
<br>questions.  First, he believes that the shift from Theater Missile 
<br>Defense (TMD) to defense of populations and territory will give publics 
<br>a false sense of security, since the sword was ultimately stronger than 
<br>the shield.  For France, security came from strong defense and 
<br>deterrence.  Second, Morin asked what threat the system aims to 
<br>counter.  Nuclear states or rogue states?  Third, Morin asked about 
<br>funding and how European countries would participate in command and 
<br>control (C2) decisions.  Morin summarized his own personal opposition 
<br>to MD by asserting that the U.S. and Europe have differing mentalities 
<br>on defense spending.  He said the U.S. has true resiliency with 
<br> 
<br>PARIS 00000170  002.2 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>"infinite" means, while in Europe defense spending has collapsed in 
<br>every country but the UK and France.  As a result, any development 
<br>needing common funding will dilute the already weak European defenses. 
<br>Morin concluded by stating that it was folly to assume that MD would 
<br>give us added security. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (S/NF) SecDef refuted Morin's arguments, pointing out that MD 
<br>contributes to deterrence.  SecDef explained to Morin that the system 
<br>was aimed at nations with a handful of nuclear weapons and a limited 
<br>but growing missile capability to launch them.  Noting Iran fits that 
<br>profile, SecDef said that MD provides a good deterrent against limited 
<br>attacks. 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (S/NF) SecDef agreed with MoD Morin that the U.S. owed NATO answers 
<br>on C2, costs, and the role of common funding.  He pledged to provide 
<br>more details on these issues, as well as on how ALTBMD and the U.S. 
<br>Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) fit together.  However, SecDef said it 
<br>was important to move ahead with the MD study that was endorsed at the 
<br>2009 NATO summit, since it would provide some of the answers France was 
<br>seeking.  SecDef reminded Morin that POTUS will want to obtain a 
<br>decision affirming the Alliance role in MD at the Lisbon summit in late 
<br>¶2010. 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (S/NF) Responding to SecDef's discussion of MD, Morin asked why 
<br>there was a need to shift from theater to population defense.  SecDef 
<br>said the systems the U.S. was deploying have broader applications.  For 
<br>example the THAAD system, which the U.S. had deployed to Hawaii as a 
<br>measure against North Korean threat, protects both the theater and the 
<br>population.  Gates offered the Aegis ship-borne SM-3, which was used to 
<br>shoot down a defunct satellite, as a second example of a system that 
<br>could also have broader applications and deter Iran from holding us 
<br>hostage by threatening missile launches. 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (S/NF) Recalling that Russian Prime Minister Putin once told him 
<br>Iran was Russia's greatest threat, SecDef noted that Russia could plug 
<br>into the new system.  SecDef highlighted two Russian objections to the 
<br>former system:  first, the radar in the Czech Republic would have been 
<br>so powerful that it could see into Russia; second, Russia believed that 
<br>the three-stage Ground-Based Interceptor could have been converted 
<br>easily to an offensive weapon.  The SM-3 missiles in the new approach 
<br>can only be defensive in nature, however.  For these reasons, the U.S. 
<br>believed partnering with Russia is once again potentially possible. 
<br>(NOTE:  Following the meetings, Morin's critical comments on Missile 
<br>Defense were disavowed by senior officials at the MoD and the MFA, who 
<br>said that his views were his own and that the U.S. should essentially 
<br>"erase" what he had just said.  END NOTE.) 
<br> 
<br>----- 
<br>Iran 
<br>----- 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (S/NF) Shifting from Missile Defense to Iran, SecDef noted that 
<br>Russia is now of a different mind on Iran because of Tehran's 
<br>persistent rejection of international proposals for negotiated 
<br>solutions and its concealment of the Qom facility.  SecDef believed 
<br>Russia would be supportive of a new UNSCR, although it may have 
<br>different views on the severity of sanctions, but he expressed concern 
<br>about China.  SecDef said that Russia could perhaps help on China, but 
<br>that securing the support of other non-permanent Security Council 
<br>members was also an issue.  In this regard, SecDef told Morin he had 
<br>been blunt with Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan, telling him that if 
<br>Iran developed nuclear weapons, we were facing two scenarios:  nuclear 
<br>proliferation in the Middle East or a regional war (or perhaps both). 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (S/NF) Morin asked SecDef if he believed Israel had the capability 
<br>to strike Iran without U.S. support.  SecDef responded that he didn't 
<br>know if they would be successful, but that Israel could carry out the 
<br>operation.  SecDef told Morin that he believed a conventional strike by 
<br>any nation would only delay Iranian plans by one to three years, while 
<br>unifying the Iranian people to be forever embittered against the 
<br>attacker. 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (S/NF) MoD Morin agreed that China could be problematic on the 
<br>UNSCR and queried SecDef how the U.S. believed we could ensure their 
<br>vote, especially in light of the upcoming Dalai Lama visit and the U.S. 
<br>weapons sale to Taiwan.  SecDef told Morin that because of 
<br>Congressionally mandated rules, the U.S. was required to provide 
<br>defensive weapons for Taiwan.  He observed that every time the U.S. 
<br>makes the sales to Taiwan, the Chinese suspend military-to-military 
<br>relations, but only for the short term. 
<br> 
<br>-------- 
<br>Pakistan 
<br>-------- 
<br> 
<br>¶14. (S/NF) Morin expressed doubt about the willingness of the Pakistani 
<br> 
<br>PARIS 00000170  003 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>government to fight extremists at home.  He noted that Karzai had told 
<br>the French that if the Pakistan-Afghanistan border were closed, it 
<br>would largely solve issues in Afghanistan.  SecDef replied that he had 
<br>told the Pakistani government two weeks earlier that Al Qaeda was 
<br>helping the Pakistan Taliban to destabilize Pakistan.  SecDef 
<br>highlighted the dramatic changes in Pakistan over the past 18 months, 
<br>especially in Swat and Bajaur provinces, which offered some hope of 
<br>progress.  SecDef said that there was increasing coordination between 
<br>U.S. and Pakistani forces across the border. 
<br> 
<br>----------- 
<br>Afghanistan 
<br>----------- 
<br> 
<br>¶15. (S/NF) Turning to Afghanistan, MoD Morin began by stating that 
<br>although he had announced an additional 80 trainers, France had also 
<br>sent a non-official contribution as well.  (NOTE:  Morin was referring 
<br>to a classified deployment of French Special Forces that have a limited 
<br>mission to find two kidnapped French journalists. END NOTE.)  France 
<br>had also sent an additional deployment of engineers to work exclusively 
<br>on the Counter-IED mission.  Morin underscored that France had 
<br>significantly increased its contributions in Afghanistan in the past 18 
<br>months from 2700 troops to nearly 4000. 
<br> 
<br>¶16. (S/NF) SecDef said the U.S. understood the domestic situation and 
<br>that he would not have pressed France publicly for more forces until 
<br>after the March elections.  However SecDef requested that France 
<br>strongly consider substantially increasing military and police 
<br>trainers.  SecDef said that while he would publicly praise French 
<br>troops, which U.S. troops consider terrific fighters, he was fine with 
<br>keeping these discussions close hold. 
<br> 
<br>¶17. (S/NF) Shifting topics, Morin questioned the decision to 
<br>specifically name mid-2011 as the start of a withdrawal, which Morin 
<br>thought would simply make the Taliban wait it out.  SecDef noted that 
<br>whether to set a date for transition had led to one of the most 
<br>protracted debates in Washington in recent months.  SecDef had come to 
<br>the conclusion, however, that the Afghans needed to be put on notice 
<br>that they would need to take responsibility for their own security.  He 
<br>pointed out that there is no end date for U.S. involvement; July 2011 
<br>is just the beginning of a process.  POTUS was very clear that the 
<br>transition would be conditions-based.  Morin agreed with this and urged 
<br>that clear benchmarks be set that could reassure public opinion. 
<br>SecDef concurred and observed that the U.S. public will not tolerate a 
<br>prolonged stalemate. 
<br> 
<br>-------------- 
<br>Russia/Mistral 
<br>-------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶18. (S/NF) SecDef expressed U.S. concerns about the Mistral sale to 
<br>Russia.  He told Morin that because of Sarkozy's involvement in 
<br>brokering a ceasefire in Georgia, which Russia was not fully honoring, 
<br>the sale would send the wrong message to Russia and to our Allies in 
<br>Central and East Europe. 
<br> 
<br>¶19. (S/NF) Morin told SecDef pointedly that he had pushed hard for the 
<br>sale.  He conceded that it was indeed a warship for power projection. 
<br>But Morin asked rhetorically how we can tell Russia we desire 
<br>partnership but then not trust them.  Morin told SecDef that he 
<br>understood the U.S. position on considering Central and East European 
<br>Allies' concerns about the perceived threat from Russia.  Morin argued, 
<br>however, that this single ship would not make any difference with 
<br>respect to Russian capabilities, as Russia's naval production ability 
<br>was severely degraded. 
<br> 
<br>¶20. (S/NF) SecDef replied that U.S. concerns were not about military 
<br>capacity but about messaging.  Some allies, because of their past 
<br>experiences, are still very concerned with Russia and are not sure how 
<br>much to trust the West.  SecDef observed that Russian democracy has 
<br>disappeared and the government was an oligarchy run by the security 
<br>services.  President Medvedev has a more pragmatic vision for Russia 
<br>than PM Putin, but there has been little real change. 
<br> 
<br>-------------- 
<br>KC-X Tanker RFP 
<br>-------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶21. (S/NF) Morin told SecDef he had one final, but major, topic to 
<br>raise, the U.S. contract tender for a new tanker plane.  He asked that 
<br>the RFP be issued so that competition was equal for both companies and 
<br>there was no bias.  Morin stressed that it was important for our market 
<br>economy to be a two-way street.  He told SecDef that if the terms of 
<br>competition are unequal, EADS would not submit a bid. 
<br> 
<br>¶22. (S/NF) SecDef stated his belief that the RFP would be fair.  He 
<br> 
<br>PARIS 00000170  004 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>told Morin that the Air Force had established the requirements.  He 
<br>noted that since the previous competition, he had fired both the 
<br>civilian and military leaders of the Air Force and that there was a new 
<br>person in charge of the Pentagon's acquisition policy.  SecDef said 
<br>that it would be disappointing if EADS did not submit a proposal. 
<br> 
<br>¶23. (U) SecDef has cleared this cable.  Drafted by OSD Staff.
