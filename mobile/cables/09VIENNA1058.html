<br>SUBJECT: AUSTRIAN FOREIGN POLICY IN DOLDRUMS, BUT
<br>OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARTNERSHIP EXIST 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Econ/Pol Counselor Dean Yap. Reason: 1.4(b) and (d).
<br>
<br>Summary
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) For many reasons, the present Austrian Government has
<br>largely ignored foreign policy since its formation in
<br>December 2008. Some of the reasons -- economic crisis,
<br>budget cuts, lack of ministerial interest -- are specific to
<br>the new government. Others, however -- lack of a long-term
<br>goal, popular isolationism -- are deeply rooted. Though
<br>Austria has the potential to be a significant U.S. partner in
<br>southeastern Europe and the Black Sea region, overcoming both
<br>the immediate and the deeply-rooted causes of Austria's
<br>foreign policy doldrums will require significant U.S. effort,
<br>coordinated with major European partners.
<br>
<br>A Lack of Leadership
<br>--------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) The Grand Coalition government re-installed in Austria
<br>in Dec. 2008 brought a series of new faces into foreign
<br>policy leadership positions. However, neither Chancellor
<br>Faymann (SPO) nor Foreign Minister Spindelegger (OVP) had
<br>significant foreign policy experience. Since then, it has
<br>become clear that Faymann has no personal interest in foreign
<br>affairs -- we have heard this from xxxxxxxxxxxx as well as senior staff in the President's Office and Foreign Ministry. Foreign Minister
<br>Spindelegger, while widely credited with good intentions, is
<br>seen as uncertain in which direction he would like to lead
<br>the Ministry. xxxxxxxxxxxx has told us he believes Spindelegger will use the annual meeting of Austrian Ambassadors in September to set forth a clear vision for Austrian diplomacy. However, xxxxxxxxxxxx fears he doesn't have the combination of vision and focus needed to maximize Austria's limited
<br>resources. The third potential ministerial-level player in
<br>foreign policy, holdover Defense Minister Darabos, is also
<br>seen as uninterested in foreign and international security
<br>affairs and is openly hostile to deploying Austrian troops on
<br>dangerous missions abroad (e.g., to Afghanistan). Other
<br>ministries, for example Interior and Justice, when approached
<br>about support for international programs (e.g., police or
<br>judicial training in Afghanistan, have rejected the idea out
<br>of hand because of a combination of budgetary constraints,
<br>rising domestic needs, and danger).
<br>
<br>Little Time or Money
<br>--------------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Compounding the leadership problem, the economic
<br>crisis has meant that the political leadership has had little
<br>time to devote to foreign policy, unless it has a
<br>straightforward domestic political impact (such as
<br>maintaining Austria's effective ban on GMO agriculture or EU
<br>matters like the proposed common asylum policy). Moreover,
<br>the Government has cut foreign affairs related budgets deeply
<br>to compensate partially for massive new counter-cyclical
<br>spending. The defense, Foreign Ministry, and official
<br>development aid budget have all suffered significant cuts.
<br>The Chief of Defense has said that Austria cannot sustain its
<br>current overseas deployments on the new budget, let alone
<br>proceed with plans for force restructuring. The Foreign
<br>Ministry has closed several posts, reduced its travel budget
<br>by one third, and cut administrative budgets. Aid programs
<br>have not been cut outright, but because of the elimination of
<br>debt forgiveness spending, ODA is expected to fall from
<br>nearly 0.5% of GNI to 0.37% or less over two years.
<br>
<br>Deep-Seated Problems
<br>--------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Austrians would likely remain ambivalent about foreign
<br>policy engagement even if the immediate problems noted above
<br>were resolved. Since the end of the Cold War in 1990/91 and
<br>joining the EU in 1995, political scientists like the
<br>SPO-affiliated Renner Institute's Erich Froeschl say Austria
<br>has had no central foreign policy objective. The population
<br>perceives no external threats and its international status is
<br>secure. Indeed, confronted with policies from Brussels that
<br>appear to threaten local interests (such as Austria's ban on
<br>GMO cultivation) and the perceived cultural threat and rise
<br>in crime related to immigration from other EU members and
<br>Turkey, many interlocutors say Austria has become more
<br>isolationist since 1995. The rise of right-wing populist
<br>parties since the mid-1990s can be seen as confirming this
<br>analysis. Austria's largest and most influential newspaper,
<br>the "Kronen Zeitung" (with a daily readership between
<br>one-third and half the population) regularly and polemically
<br>advocates isolationist, anti-EU, and anti-U.S. positions as
<br>well. It has, however, been moderate to positive toward
<br>
<br>Vienna 00001058 002.2 of 003
<br>
<br>
<br>President Obama and some Krone columnists welcomed his Cairo
<br>and Accra speeches.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) The evolution of Austrians' understanding of their
<br>country's neutrality has reinforced isolationist sentiment.
<br>Imposed as a condition for the recovery of sovereignty in
<br>1955, in the 1960s neutrality began to be seen as a virtue
<br>that enabled Austria to do things which members of NATO or
<br>the Warsaw Pact could not -- to include profiting nicely as
<br>host to numerous international organizations or playing a
<br>mediating role in the Middle East. At the end of the Cold
<br>War, efforts by conservatives to promote NATO membership
<br>could not overcome public attachment to "perpetual
<br>neutrality" and since then any questioning of neutrality has
<br>been near-taboo. However, the concept has also evolved
<br>further and is seized upon by opponents of any overseas
<br>engagement. Once invoked, further debate becomes almost
<br>impossible. Thus, even though the NATO deployment in
<br>Afghanistan comes under a UN mandate and even though Austria
<br>previously contributed troops there, opponents gain traction
<br>by arguing that Austrian participation (beyond a few staff
<br>officers in ISAF HQ) would be a violation of neutrality. The
<br>same argument was used against deploying troops to Chad for
<br>the purely humanitarian purpose of protecting refugee camps
<br>on the border with Sudan.
<br>
<br>Attitude Toward the U.S.
<br>------------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Many contacts, such as xxxxxxxxxxxx or Albert Rohan, now
<br>serving as President of the Austrian-American Society (a
<br>post-WWII friendship organization with chapters across
<br>Austria), also see both near-term and long-term problems in
<br>Austrians' view of the United States. Austrians from
<br>post-WWII generations are often skeptical of the benefits of
<br>the U.S. as the single superpower; their skepticism is
<br>reinforced by rejection of many G.W. Bush Administration
<br>policies but it goes farther, reflecting discomfort with U.S.
<br>policies in the Mideast and with the U.S. embrace of
<br>sanctions and other punitive measures. They also have a
<br>sense that U.S. society is not as socially just, democratic,
<br>or ruled-by-law as it should be. The election of President
<br>Obama has had some impact on these views. However, while the
<br>President personally is very popular, we have seen little
<br>movement in popular attitudes or government positions on, for
<br>example, taking former Guantanamo inmates (there have been
<br>hints the government is trying to find a quiet way to change
<br>it previous rejection, but the public remains deeply
<br>opposed), criminal data sharing agreements with the U.S. to
<br>combat terrorism and crime, or support for tougher sanctions
<br>on Iran. Our Public Affairs Section is preparing a poll that
<br>we expect will shed more light on Austrian attitudes toward
<br>the U.S.
<br>
<br>Austria Can Be a Partner
<br>------------------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Despite these problems, Austria has the potential to
<br>be a significant U.S. partner in several discrete regions.
<br>In the Balkans, Austria has shown an ability to project a
<br>coordinated, comprehensive strategy that perfectly
<br>complements U.S. diplomatic goals in the region. It has
<br>deployed hundreds of peacekeepers to Kosovo and Bosnia and is
<br>committed to maintaining that presence despite budget cuts.
<br>It provides -- bilaterally and through the EU -- significant
<br>development assistance and educational and cultural exchanges
<br>to the region. Austrian business is, through extensive
<br>investment, at the leading edge of integrating the region
<br>economically into European and global structures. Austrian
<br>diplomats promote the "European vocation" of the region and
<br>specific steps to move them toward the EU and the west.
<br>Foreign Minister Spindelegger has spoken frequently of
<br>Austria's potential role in the Black Sea region and beyond
<br>to the Caucasus. Until now, he has seemed to focus largely
<br>on providing support for Austrian economic penetration of the
<br>region. This, and particularly when energy projects such as
<br>the Nabucco pipeline are considered, is of clear benefit to
<br>the U.S. Spindelegger has not, however, as yet seemed to
<br>have a broader vision for his initiative.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Austria also has a long record of support for arms
<br>control and disarmament efforts and has welcomed President
<br>Obama's nuclear arms control initiatives. As a strong
<br>supporter of the NPT, host of the IAEA, and a member of the
<br>UN Security Council in 2009-10, Austria is well placed to
<br>support U.S.-initiatives in this field. As a UNSC member,
<br>opportunities for diplomatic support in other fields may
<br>appear -- prior to its election to the UNSC, the GoA had
<br>signaled an interest in increasing its profile and presence
<br>in sub-Saharan Africa. We also see potential for cooperation
<br>on environmental policy in the UNFCCC process -- provided we
<br>can get detailed, advance information on U.S. positions to
<br>
<br>Vienna 00001058 003 of 003
<br>
<br>
<br>allow for meaningfully detailed consultations with the GoA.
<br>On the public diplomacy side, the GoA remains committed to
<br>the Fulbright program; it is the majority financial
<br>contributor.
<br>
<br>Obstacles on the Road
<br>---------------------
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) On the downside, Iran will be a bone of contention
<br>sometime in coming months. Whethe the issue is Iran,s
<br>nuclear weapons program or he Tehran regime,s heavy-handed
<br>curbs on democraization, we anticipate a period of difficult
<br>conersations regarding the likely need for tougher
<br>sancions. Although Austria will probably go along ith an
<br>EU consensus regarding Iran, within EU concils Vienna will
<br>opt for slower, softer measure. These differences are
<br>likely to crop up withi the UNSC as well. Similarly, on
<br>international law enforcement, specifics of money-laundering
<br>and information exchange measures will come into focus sooner
<br>or later and will find entrenched Austrian interests
<br>unwilling to cooperate with the U.S. and international bodies
<br>(e.g. OECD) to the extent needed for a variety of reasons.
<br>The USG will have to press vigorously for more responsible
<br>Austrian positions without closing the door to greater
<br>cooperation in other, less contentious areas that in time
<br>could have a beneficial spillover effect in the overall
<br>relationship.
<br>
<br>Getting To Yes
<br>--------------
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Making the Austrians partners in such specific
<br>projects does not mean the USG must overcome all the
<br>obstacles outlined in paras 2-6 to a more activist Vienna.
<br>However, it does require specific, tailored messages
<br>delivered by and to senior levels. It also requires a
<br>vigorous public diplomacy program. The Embassy has made
<br>public diplomacy our top MSP priority in the last two years.
<br>Beyond PA, the Front Office, Econ/Pol, and other sections
<br>each devote considerable resources to this effort. We will
<br>continue to do so, engaging Austrian society across the
<br>board, across the country, and across the generations. The
<br>FO will also work to engage the GoA at ministerial level on
<br>the entire U.S agenda. To support our local efforts, we also
<br>urge senior Department officials responsible for the issues
<br>outlined above to engage the Austrian Embassy and, when in
<br>Europe, to visit Vienna for consultations.
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) The GoA wants contact with the Obama Administration
<br>at cabinet level and higher. We are making it clear that
<br>such contact requires real U.S.-Austrian partnership. While
<br>some U.S. desires are probably unachievable (new military
<br>deployments, for example), there is potential for a new
<br>partnership that could meet with a favorable response in
<br>Vienna and help move Austria toward greater international
<br>engagement.
