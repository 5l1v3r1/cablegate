<br>E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/17/2016
<br>TAGS: PREL KPAL TS
<br>SUBJECT: SUHA ARAFAT ACQUIRES TUNISIAN NATIONALITY
<br>
<br>REF: TUNIS 2565
<br>
<br>Classified By: CDA David Ballard for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) The Government of Tunisia's Official Journal of
<br>September 26 published a notice that Suha Arafat, wife of the
<br>late Palestinian Authority president, and her 11-year old
<br>daughter Zahwa had acquired Tunisian nationality. Mrs.
<br>Arafat and her daughter have been living in Tunisia since the
<br>2004 death of Yasser Arafat, and Zahwa Arafat attends the
<br>American Cooperative School of Tunisia. Suha Arafat's
<br>presence in Tunisia long predates that, however. She had
<br>been a resident of Tunisia prior to her marriage, and, after
<br>residing in the Palestinian Territories from 1996-98, she
<br>returned in 1998, alternating between residences in France
<br>and Tunisia.
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) The above news item has been picked up by various
<br>media outlets, including Reuters. Other recent wire reports
<br>on Mrs. Arafat, reporting her alleged marriage to Belhassen
<br>Trabelsi, the brother-in-law of Tunisian President Zine El
<br>Abidine Ben Ali, are false, however, and Mrs. Arafat has been
<br>quite vocal in denying them in the press.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Comment: We remain puzzled as to why Mrs. Arafat
<br>would want Tunisian citizenship, and why now, since she
<br>already enjoyed the privilege of a Tunisian diplomatic
<br>passport, and we doubt that she was eager to exercise her
<br>right to vote in Tunisia or become a member of the Tunisian
<br>National Assembly. The only other tangible benefit of
<br>citizenship is that Tunisian law forbids foreigners to own
<br>agricultural land -- and Mrs. Arafat is not known to be an
<br>aspiring farmer. One possible motivation is that under
<br>Tunisian law, foreign participation in a totally
<br>non-exporting service industry cannot exceed 50 percent.
<br>Several months ago, Mrs. Arafat set up one such company -- to
<br>build an international school in Tunis. Tunisian citizenship
<br>will allow her to control this company. As for what was in
<br>such a move for the GOT, Post suspects that a continuing
<br>desire on the part of the government to market itself as
<br>closely tied to the Palestinian people played a role. The
<br>GOT probably feels the need for some Palestinian "cover"
<br>during this time when newspapers are full of stories on the
<br>government's campaign against the hijab (reftel). In
<br>addition, Mrs. Arafat is said to be good friends with the
<br>First Lady, Leila Ben Ali. End Comment.
