<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Clifford Sobel. Reasons: 1.4 (B and D).
<br>
<br>¶1. (U) Summary: The relationship between the United States
<br>and Brazil is as productive and broad-based as it as ever
<br>been, the result of the excellent relationship between
<br>President Bush and President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, new
<br>cooperation mechanisms on biofuels, business issues, and
<br>economic matters, and our shared goals of fostering
<br>hemispheric stability, promoting democracy, developing a
<br>consensus on next steps regarding climate change, and
<br>achieving a mutually satisfactory conclusion to the Doha
<br>round of WTO negotiations. Cooperation on law enforcement
<br>issues, such as counternarcotics, container security, and
<br>intelligence sharing, are highlights of the bilateral
<br>relationship. Brazilian officials at the policy level,
<br>however, are always keen to underplay the range of organized
<br>criminal activities, including arms and narcotics trafficking
<br>and money laundering that takes place in the
<br>Argentina/Brazil/Paraguay tri-border area (TBA). U.S.-Brazil
<br>cooperation on foreign policy issues is often limited by the
<br>GoB's unwillingness to speak out against anti-democratic
<br>actions in the hemisphere (Venezuela and Cuba), take
<br>proactive steps to address key issues such as nuclear
<br>proliferation and counterterrorist concerns, and expand its
<br>international leadership in meaningful ways. Brazil's
<br>ethanol program has made it a global model for alternative
<br>energy and offers potential for bilateral cooperation on an
<br>important strategic issue. On the environment, Brazil has
<br>long been on the defensive about the ongoing, extensive
<br>deforestation of the Amazon, which has made Brazil one of the
<br>leading producers of greenhouse gases. The Brazilian labor
<br>movement is strong, well-organized, and very influential in
<br>many key industrial sectors. Lula came out of the organized
<br>labor movement and labor and social issues have always been
<br>among his top priorities. Trafficking in Persons is present
<br>in all of its forms in Brazil, but the GoB is making a
<br>serious effort to combat it. End Summary.
<br>
<br>----------------------------------
<br>Lula Popular, but What Comes Next?
<br>----------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) With a 67 percent approval rating, President Lula is
<br>more popular than at any other point since he took office in
<br>¶2003. Continuity and legacy are the guiding lights of Lula's
<br>second term. Lula continues to shape his legacy as a friend
<br>of the poor and builder of a foundation for prosperity for
<br>the lower and middle classes through broad social welfare
<br>programs and a vast, new economic growth program of public
<br>works and growth incentives. At the same time, Lula has
<br>failed to promote needed reforms to abolish a political
<br>culture of corruption, clientelism, and spoils. Although a
<br>seemingly endless series of corruption scandals has not
<br>dented his personal popularity or that of his government,
<br>these scandals have felled political allies, including
<br>cabinet ministers, in recent years.
<br>
<br>¶3. (U) Lula is concerned with finding an electable successor
<br>for 2010, and appears to be grooming his top domestic policy
<br>adviser, Minister Dilma Rousseff, while keeping other options
<br>open. Attention in the media and among the political elite
<br>is already focused on the race; the opposition governor of
<br>Sao Paulo state and former presidential candidate, Jose
<br>Serra, currently leads the pack of possible candidates.
<br>
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>Latin America's Economic Powerhouse
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (U) President Lula and his economic team,s prudent fiscal
<br>and monetary policies and reform efforts are a major reason
<br>for his popularity and have resulted in Brazil,s position as
<br>the tenth largest economy in the world, with a trade surplus
<br>and, just this year, achievement of a BBB-minus (lowest
<br>investment grade) credit rating. Annual GDP growth was
<br>approximately 5.4 percent for 2007, with inflation within its
<br>target range at 4 percent. Buoyed by exports and investment
<br>inflows, Brazil's currency, the Real, has remained strong,
<br>and the government has succeeded in paying down its external
<br>debt. However, there are major structural challenges to long
<br>term growth. Real interest rates are among the highest in
<br>the world. The informal sector constitutes an estimated 40
<br>percent of the economy, in part due to the tax burden (34.2
<br>percent of GDP in 2006), one of the highest among large
<br>developing economies. Brazil,s opaque and onerous
<br>regulatory and legal system, as well as poor transport and
<br>
<br>BRASILIA 00000823 002 OF 006
<br>
<br>
<br>other infrastructure, continue to constrain growth.
<br>
<br>-------------------------------------------
<br>Friendly Cooperation, Not Strong Friendship
<br>-------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Bilaterally, the GoB has pursued generally friendly
<br>relations with the United States and we continue to seek
<br>opportunities for positive bilateral cooperation. Following
<br>the signing of the biofuels MOU in March 2007, Brazil and the
<br>United States have been seeking ways to increase our
<br>collaboration toward the next generation of biofuels, as well
<br>as in developing international standards on biofuels which
<br>should facilitate greater international acceptance and use of
<br>biofuels. The Economic Policy Dialogue (EPD) launched last
<br>year provides an important opportunity to reinforce our view
<br>of Brazil as partner. Cooperation to foster innovation and
<br>agricultural coordination, to possibly include assistance to
<br>African countries, are new topics of conversation
<br>bilaterally. Additionally, we have been working to develop a
<br>regional infrastructure initiative. We have been exploring
<br>one another,s regulatory frameworks in hopes of addressing
<br>barriers and achieving a Bilateral Tax Treaty and a Bilateral
<br>Investment Treaty. Civil aviation is an area of renewed
<br>focus with the next round of talks scheduled for the week of
<br>June 23rd. There are also continuing efforts under the
<br>auspices of the bilateral CEO Forum to address issues of
<br>common interest.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Nonetheless, the GoB continues to favor building ties
<br>with developing nations over closer relations with the United
<br>States and other developed nations. While seeking to expand
<br>our bilateral dialogue, the GoB has studiously avoided
<br>working closely with us on broad strategic issues important
<br>to us. Those issues on which it has been willing to work
<br>with us--biofuels, investment, and climate change, for
<br>example--are areas where the GoB considers itself a visibly
<br>equal partner. The exception may be security-related issues,
<br>where the appointment of Nelson Jobim as Defense Minister has
<br>brought new interest in cooperation. But it appears that in
<br>this area, as with our efforts on counternarcotics,
<br>environmental protection, counterterrorism, and other issues,
<br>the Foreign Ministry is seeking to maintain its historic
<br>dominance and distance from the United States, which it does
<br>by controlling the agenda and throwing up barriers that delay
<br>and sometimes scuttle bilateral efforts that other ministries
<br>support.
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) The Brazilian public has a mixed view of the United
<br>States. Seventy-five percent say relations between Brazil
<br>and the U.S. are very good or fairly good, and Brazilians by
<br>a wide margin consider the U.S. the most important country in
<br>the region for Brazil. Those who follow the news know that
<br>U.S.-Brazil cooperation on trade issues has global importance
<br>and new areas of cooperation such as biofuels are potentially
<br>significant. There has been a much more positive view of
<br>U.S.-Brazil cooperation since the signing of the biofuels MOU
<br>last year. On the other hand, there is a good deal of
<br>skepticism about U.S. foreign policy, particularly on issues
<br>such as Iraq and Cuba. There is resentment over the long
<br>wait times for U.S. visa applications, a product of a spike
<br>in demand without commensurate increases in staffing.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------
<br>Hesitant Globally; Cautious Regionally
<br>--------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Brazil's foreign policy is dominated by symbolic steps
<br>to burnish its South-South credentials and status as an
<br>emerging leader, rather than by resolute attention to core
<br>political and economic interests, including strengthening
<br>bilateral political and trade relations with the United
<br>States. The attainment of a permanent seat on the UN
<br>Security Council has been a central tenet of Brazil's foreign
<br>policy under President Lula's government, and most of its
<br>actions on the international stage are geared toward that
<br>goal. However, Brazil has largely failed to assume the
<br>international leadership role that would make it a strong
<br>candidate for such a position. Brazil's latest two-year
<br>stint on the UNSC, which ended in January 2006, was
<br>characterized by caution and equivocation rather than vision
<br>and leadership. The GoB has so far not used its significant
<br>contribution to stability in Haiti as a step along the road
<br>to becoming a champion of international peace and security.
<br>For example, the GoB has yet to respond to repeated requests
<br>for assistance with peacekeeping in Darfur.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Brazil's general desire not to be too closely
<br>identified with the U.S. is borne out in non-proliferation.
<br>
<br>BRASILIA 00000823 003 OF 006
<br>
<br>
<br>The GoB has expressed approval of the Proliferation Security
<br>Initiative (PSI), but has not yet endorsed the PSI statement
<br>of principles. Brazil has also not yet signed the NPT
<br>Additional Protocol, although it has not ruled out signing it
<br>in the near future. The GoB consistently refused to take a
<br>strong position against Iran's nuclear efforts, questioning
<br>the effort to refer Iran to the Security Council until the
<br>vote in the IAEA had become a foregone conclusion. Brazilian
<br>officials consider their seat at the table in Annapolis as a
<br>foreign policy success and see themselves as balanced in
<br>their dealings with Israel and the Palestinians, but they
<br>have yet to define a substantive role for Brazil. FM
<br>Amorim's suggestion recently that Iran, Syria, Hamas, and
<br>Hizbollah should be included in the negotiations suggest
<br>continuing naivete regarding the peace process and Middle
<br>East relations, as does his recent remark to a U.S. official
<br>that Brazil's growing "friendship" with Iran will prove
<br>useful should the United States, in the future, decide to
<br>engage Iran.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Regionally, Lula has maintained Brazil's historic
<br>focus on stability, seeing dialogue and good relations with
<br>all parties as the best way to achieve this goal. As a
<br>result, Brazil maintains an active dialogue with and refuses
<br>to criticize human rights violations in Venezuela and Cuba,
<br>has worked hard to restore relations with Bolivia even at the
<br>expense of its own economic interests, and stood firmly on
<br>the principle of respect for sovereignty, with only minimal
<br>mention of counterterrorism concerns, in responding to the
<br>recent dispute between Colombia and Ecuador.
<br>
<br>---------------------------
<br>Law Enforcement Cooperation
<br>---------------------------
<br>
<br>¶11. (SBU) Cooperation on security and law enforcement issues
<br>is a highlight of the bilateral relationship, and a potential
<br>area for increased cooperation as public security is
<br>frequently cited in opinion polls as the most pressing
<br>concern for Brazilians. The newly arrived Resident Legal
<br>Advisor is working in support of USG law enforcement agencies
<br>and the political and economic sections to expand and
<br>intensify our relations with the judiciary, prosecutors, and
<br>Brazilian law enforcement. We hope this year to seat another
<br>Brazilian observer at JIATF-S. Also, the GoB has expressed
<br>interest in negotiating a General Security of Information
<br>Agreement (GSOIA). The Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS)
<br>expects to sign a new Letter of Agreement shorly, which
<br>will allow us to move forward to expad cooperation on
<br>counternarcotics and countercrie issues, including at the
<br>state level. The GoBcooperates with the USG on the
<br>operational level in the fight against terrorism, document
<br>fraud, ad drug trafficking. Information sharing at the
<br>orking level between Brazilian and US law enforcemnt and
<br>intelligence agencies is productive. Brail has been a
<br>valuable partner in the efforts to secure our own borders
<br>against terrorism through ts support for DHS's Container
<br>Security Initiatie (CSI), its implementation of enhanced
<br>passenge screening at airports and its fulfillment of the
<br>International Maritime Organization (IMO) ISPS code on port
<br>and ship security. Immigration and Cusoms Enforcement (ICE)
<br>is also currently working ith the Brazilian authorities to
<br>detect financia and smuggling violations, financial crimes
<br>and commercial fraud with the assistance of the Trade
<br>Transparency Unit (TTU) initiative.
<br>
<br>---------------------------
<br>Cooperation on Cybercrimes
<br>---------------------------
<br>
<br>¶12. (U) Assisting Brazil in creating legislation to counter
<br>cybercrimes, including online child pornography and tracking
<br>of sex offenders, represents another potential area of
<br>cooperation on law enforcement matters. Brazil lacks
<br>cybercrime laws and the Congress has opened a Parliamentary
<br>Committee of Inquiry (CPI) to look at the issue and come up
<br>with draft legislation. As part of the CPI's work, the CPI
<br>was able to obtain over 3,000 Google records of identified
<br>child pornography that had been distributed on the Internet
<br>from Brazil. The chairman of the CPI has voiced his concern
<br>about, in his view, inadequate cooperation from Google and
<br>its subsidiary Orkut, a relationship site. Google, Orkut,
<br>Microsoft, and all other Internet service providers are
<br>required to report the discovery of child pornography on the
<br>Internet and DHS/ICE has established a mechanism to have
<br>access to this information which has been reported. DHS/ICE
<br>has already initiated the practice of sharing this
<br>information with Brazilian Federal Police. Related to the
<br>CPI, its Chairman has made inquiries to the Mission on the
<br>
<br>BRASILIA 00000823 004 OF 006
<br>
<br>
<br>case of DHS/ICE Deportation officer accused of child
<br>exploitation at a hotel in Brazil. The U.S. is seeking the
<br>toughest penalty possible, whether in Brazil or the U.S., and
<br>is fully cooperating with Brazilian authorities.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----------------
<br>Counterterrorism: Operational Cooperation; Policy-Level
<br>Equivocation
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----------------
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Cooperation on counterterrorism matters remains good
<br>at the operational level, and we regularly obtain valuable
<br>information from GoB sources on terrorism. The Lula
<br>administration just re-structured its intelligence apparatus
<br>to beef up their counterterrorism focus. The senior policy
<br>levels of the GoB, however, have refused to publicly endorse
<br>U.S. counterterrorism initiatives and, wary of Brazil's
<br>large, prosperous and influential Arab population, make every
<br>effort to downplay in public even the possibility of
<br>terrorist fund-raising going on inside Brazil, a situation
<br>exacerbated by their refusal to consider Hizballah or HAMAS
<br>as terrorist organizations. The Lula administration failed
<br>to introduce long-delayed draft legislation outlawing
<br>terrorist-related activity, including its financing.
<br>
<br>¶14. (U) The governments of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay
<br>have long been concerned over illicit activities in the
<br>tri-border area (TBA) joining Foz de Iguacu in Brazil, Ciudad
<br>del Este in Paraguay, and Puerto Iguazu in Argentina. The
<br>TBA concentrates a range of organized criminal activities,
<br>including arms and narcotics trafficking, document fraud,
<br>money laundering, as well as the manufacture and movement of
<br>contraband goods. A wide variety of counterfeit goods,
<br>including cigarettes, CDs, DVDs, and computer software, are
<br>moved from Asia into Paraguay and transported primarily
<br>across the border into Brazil. This inflow of illicit goods
<br>stands to be increased with the potential passage of
<br>legislation that purports to ease customs procedures for
<br>small-scale importers but, due to a lack of enforcement
<br>provisions, would likely serve to abet traffickers. The
<br>United States remains concerned that Hizballah and HAMAS are
<br>raising funds in the TBA by participating in illicit
<br>activities and soliciting donations from extremists within
<br>the sizable Muslim communities in the region.
<br>
<br>¶15. (U) In the 1990s the three governments established a
<br>mechanism, which the US joined in 2002 at their invitation,
<br>to address illicit activities in the TBA. The "3 1 Group on
<br>Tri-border Area Security" is intended to improve the
<br>capabilities of the three TBA states to thwart cross-border
<br>criminal activity and potential terrorist fundraising
<br>activity. Brazil is an active partner within this mechanism,
<br>but the effectiveness of this group is hampered by GoB
<br>denials of any potential terrorist activity taking place in
<br>their territory (see reftels). The suggestion that planning
<br>for the 1994 bombing of AMIA, an Argentine Jewish center,
<br>might have taken place in Brazil caused the GoB to abstain in
<br>an international vote over whether to issue Interpol warrants
<br>for Iranian officials accused in the case, an action that
<br>disappointed and irritated Argentina. Nonetheless, Brazil
<br>has established and hosts a Joint Intelligence Center (JIC)
<br>in Foz de Iguacu to combat transnational criminal activity,
<br>although staffing issues on the part of Argentina and
<br>Paraguay continue to impede its full functioning.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------
<br>Labor and Trafficking in Persons: An Improving Record
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------
<br>
<br>¶16. (SBU) The labor movement in Brazil is strong,
<br>well-organized, and very influential in many key industrial
<br>sectors. President Lula comes from the labor movement. He
<br>worked his way up through the powerful metal workers union,
<br>was one of the founders of the largest Brazilian labor
<br>confederations -- the Unified Workers Confederation of Brazil
<br>(CUT) -- and of the ruling Workers Party (PT). Labor and
<br>related social issues, such as combating Trafficking in
<br>Persons (TIP), and forced labor, are important priorities of
<br>the Lula Administration. The Lula Government's commitment to
<br>social issues is exemplified by its popular Bolsa Familia
<br>(Family Stipend) program which involves direct cash pay outs
<br>to over 11 million families as an incentive for low-income
<br>Brazilians to keep their children in school and up-to-date
<br>with their immunizations. Most economists and policymakers
<br>agree that labor reform is necessary for the Brazilian
<br>economy to grow at a faster rate and to reduce the large
<br>informal sector, which employees close to 45 percent of all
<br>Brazilian workers. However, comprehensive labor reform is
<br>politically unpopular and unlikely to happen during the Lula
<br>
<br>BRASILIA 00000823 005 OF 006
<br>
<br>
<br>Administration.
<br>
<br>¶17. (SBU) The use of child labor and the exploitation of
<br>children for sexual purposes is widespread in Brazil. NGOs
<br>estimate that there are at least 240,000 children working
<br>illegally, although the number may be much higher. The
<br>Federal Police estimate that at least 250,000 children are
<br>involved in prostitution, while some NGO's put the number as
<br>high as 500,000. Many work in the poor northeastern sector
<br>of Brazil where there is a booming sex tourism industry
<br>catering mostly to Europeans, and to a lesser extent,
<br>Americans.
<br>
<br>¶18. (U) Trafficking in Persons is present in all of its forms
<br>in Brazil, including the trafficking of women and children
<br>internally and internationally for purposes of sexual
<br>exploitation, the internal trafficking of men for use in
<br>slave or forced labor in the cattle-raising and agricultural
<br>sectors, and in the production of charcoal, some of which is
<br>used to produce pig iron. There are an undocumented number
<br>of foreign laborers working in slave-like conditions in
<br>factories in the city and state of Sao Paulo. However, the
<br>GoB is making a serious effort to combat TIP and forced/slave
<br>labor. It signed the Palermo Protocol in 2004 and is now
<br>working to get implementing legislation passed by the
<br>Congress. President Lula signed a decree in October 2006
<br>establishing a national anti-TIP policy. A binding work plan
<br>to implement that policy was publicly in January 2008.
<br>Ministry of Labor mobile inspection teams have freed over
<br>29,000 laborers from slave-like working conditions since
<br>starting work in 1993. The inspection teams freed over 5,900
<br>forced labor victims last year (2007) alone.
<br>
<br>¶19. (SBU) As a result of reports of slave or forced labor in
<br>the production of charcoal used to produce pig iron, in
<br>September of last year the Mission requested the GoB's
<br>concurrence in having DHS/ICE personnel work with the
<br>appropriate ministries and agencies in the Brazilian
<br>government to investigate allegations that American companies
<br>may have received products produced in Brazil with the
<br>possible use of forced labor. So far, the Brazilian
<br>government has not responded to our requests.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------------
<br>Protecting Brazil's Borders: Extreme Sensitivity on
<br>Sovereignty
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------------
<br>
<br>¶20. (U) There is long-standing and widespread fear among
<br>Brazilians that the United States or other foreigners want to
<br>take over or internationalize the Amazon. Although
<br>demonstrably unfounded, it surfaces regularly in official and
<br>media circles, as with President Lula's recent assertions
<br>that "The Amazon has an owner." More recently, the prospect
<br>of enormous oil reserves off Brazil's coast have added new
<br>fears that the United States or others might have designs on
<br>these, as well. Some Brazilians have linked the
<br>just-announced re-establishment of the U.S. Fourth Fleet to
<br>these Brazilian oil discoveries. However, most Brazilians do
<br>not realize that the Fourth Fleet consists solely of a
<br>planning staff of approximately 80 people based in Florida,
<br>and that it has no permanently assigned ships. Its main
<br>missions will be support of peacekeeping operations, such as
<br>in Haiti, respond to natural disasters, such as Hurricane
<br>Felix in Nicaragua, organize humanitarian relief, typically
<br>of a medical nature, and assist counternarcotics efforts.
<br>Standing up the Fourth Fleet intends to demonstrate the
<br>priority the United States places on its partnerships in
<br>Latin America and will help ensure that Latin America remains
<br>a high priority for U.S. engagement.
<br>
<br>¶21. (U) There have also been some rumors about the permanent
<br>stationing of a ship in Brazilian waters by the US Navy in
<br>light of the recent the port visit of the USS George
<br>Washington CVN-73. The U.S. Navy has no vessels in Brazilian
<br>waters and has not had any since the USS George Washington
<br>departed Brazilian territorial waters in early May. By
<br>policy, the U.S. Navy will not enter territorial waters of
<br>any national without diplomatic clearance and the cooperation
<br>of the host nation.
<br>
<br>¶22. (U) Defense Minister Nelson Jobim stated publicly in
<br>early June that Brazil needed to improve security for its
<br>off-shore oil resources and that, as permitted by the UN
<br>Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), Brazil was
<br>planning to increase the 200-mile exclusive economic zone to
<br>350 miles to include the Santos basin and other oil deposits
<br>located on Brazil's continental shelf.. Although there were
<br>suggestions in the press that the United States might not
<br>
<br>BRASILIA 00000823 006 OF 006
<br>
<br>
<br>respect such an extension because we have not ratified
<br>UNCLOS, the U.S. does fully respect exclusive economic zones
<br>established pursuant to customary international law as
<br>reflected in UNCLOS. Furthermore, the US has established its
<br>own exclusive economic zone according to the same customary
<br>international law. UNCLOS recognizes the sovereign rights of
<br>a coastal State over its continental shelf, which extends out
<br>to 200 nautical miles--and beyond, if it meets specific
<br>criteria. These rights include sovereign rights for the
<br>purpose of exploring the continental shelf and exploiting its
<br>natural resources, including oil, gas, and other energy
<br>resources.
