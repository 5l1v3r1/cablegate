<br>Classified By: DCM Hugo Llorens; Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary. National Court Examining Magistrate Ismael
<br>Moreno requested on January 31 that the Spanish Ministry of
<br>Defense and the National Intelligence Center (CNI) declassify
<br>any information related to the transit of CIA aircraft
<br>through Spanish territory, as well as any information
<br>indicating whether Spanish airports were used for the
<br>transfer of detainees in other countries. In a related
<br>action, Judge Moreno denied a motion by the plaintiffs to
<br>require the current and former heads of the CNI to testify in
<br>the case, as well as a second motion by the plaintiffs to
<br>name as suspects the 13 U.S. persons listed in the
<br>investigation. In an unusual demonstration of bipartisan
<br>accord, both the ruling Socialist (PSOE) and opposition
<br>Popular Party (PP) Parliamentarians expressed support for the
<br>declassification of the requested documents. The National
<br>Court prosecutor handling the CIA flights case told Legat
<br>that the prosecutors would not seek to block the request for
<br>declassified information because it was understood by Spanish
<br>authorities that neither the CNI nor the MOD held any
<br>incriminating or sensitive information related to the
<br>flights. The prosecutor said that the release of the little
<br>information they did have would do no harm and said that the
<br>Spanish Government would not seek additional information from
<br>the USG related to this case. We are less concerned by the
<br>immediate importance of any declassified information from the
<br>CNI or MOD than by the apparent coordination between Judge
<br>Moreno in Spain and German investigators in the El Masri
<br>case. Spanish media reported January 31 and February 1 that
<br>German investigators used information from Spanish news
<br>sources and from the Spanish Civil Guard in ordering the
<br>detention of 13 "CIA members" on charges of abduction and
<br>bodily harm. The plaintiffs and extreme left political
<br>parties will work together to keep this issue on the front
<br>burner in Spain. End Summary.
<br>
<br>//JUDGE REQUESTS DECLASSIFICATION OF OFFICIAL INFORMATION//
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) Judge Moreno approved requests by the plaintiffs in
<br>the CIA flights case, the "Free Association of Attorneys" and
<br>a group of Mallorcan professionals, calling for the
<br>declassification of any information held by the CNI or the
<br>MOD related to the transit of alleged CIA aircraft through
<br>the airports of Tenerife, Barcelona, Malaga, Palma de
<br>Mallorca, and others. According to reports, the Spanish
<br>judicial investigation is focused on the following flights:
<br>
<br>- Algiers to Palma to Skopje on January 22, 2004
<br>
<br>- Guantanamo to Tenerife to Constanza, Romania on April 12,
<br>2004, and
<br>
<br>- Madrid to Luxor, Egypt on December 16, 2003.
<br>
<br>In his request to the MOD, Judge Moreno asks for a report on
<br>"whether Spanish airports were used in the alleged events
<br>described in Council of Europe Report 10957 of June 12, 2006"
<br>related to the detentions of 12 alleged terrorists: Jaled El
<br>Masri, Ahmed Agiza, Mohammed al Zary, Hasam Usama, Mustafa
<br>Nasr (Abu Omar), Bisher al Rawi, Yamil El Banna, Masher Arar,
<br>Mohamed Bashmila, Salah Ali Qaru, Mohammed Zammar, and Binyam
<br>Mohammed.
<br>
<br>¶3. (U) Judge Moreno denied motions by the plaintiffs
<br>demanding that the 13 U.S. persons accused by the plaintiffs
<br>of abduction and torture (REF A) be formally named as
<br>suspects. Moreno said that he would not do so because the
<br>identities of the crew of the Boeing 737, tail number N313P,
<br>had not been firmly established. He also denied a
<br>plaintiff's motion requiring the testimony in the case of CNI
<br>Director Alberto Saiz as well as his predecessor Jorge
<br>Dezcallar (brother of MFA Director General for Foreign Policy
<br>Rafael Dezcallar). This request by the plaintiffs stems from
<br>a November 28, 2001 meeting between President Bush and
<br>then-President Aznar, after which Aznar reportedly declared
<br>that "all of the mechanisms for cooperation in intelligence
<br>operations" were in place. Shortly thereafter, on December
<br>11, the first alleged CIA flight through Spanish territory
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000173 002.2 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>took place.
<br>
<br>¶4. (U) Judge Moreno also set aside a request by the
<br>plaintiffs for the testimony of the former Council of Europe
<br>human rights commissioner Alvaro Gil-Robles (on the grounds
<br>that Gil-Robles' reports on a detention center in Kosovo had
<br>not led to any conclusive police investigations) and the
<br>testimony of "El Pais" journalist Jose Maria Irujo, who has
<br>followed the CIA flights case as well as Islamic extremism in
<br>Spain. Judge Moreno indicated that his decisions on all of
<br>these issues (the naming of the 13 persons as suspects,
<br>requiring the testimony of CNI directors, and calling of
<br>additional witnesses) could be revisited by him or by a panel
<br>of trial judges if new information emerged to support the
<br>plaintiffs' case.
<br>
<br>//BIPARTISAN POLITICAL SUPPORT FOR DECLASSIFICATION//
<br>
<br>¶5. (U) Politicians weighed in quickly on the decision, with
<br>ruling center-left PSOE and opposition center-right PP
<br>Parliamentarians voicing their support for the
<br>declassification of the relevant MOD and CNI records. PSOE
<br>Foreign Relations Commission Spokesperson Fatima Aburto said
<br>all documents should be declassified that pointed to any
<br>"illegal act that may have taken place in Spain." Aburto
<br>said that the focus should be on whether the aircraft in
<br>question had "illegally detained persons" aboard and said
<br>that the Zapatero Government would review its files to
<br>determine whether any such incriminating information was
<br>available that could assist in the investigation. Aburto
<br>said that documents that information indicating that a USG
<br>aircraft had made a stopover in Spain and then participated
<br>in an illegal act in a third country "should not be
<br>declassified, because such actions would not constitute the
<br>commission of an illegal act in Spain." She stressed the
<br>PSOE's dedication to deal with this issue in a transparent
<br>manner and said that the results of Spanish Government
<br>inquiries to the USG on this matter did not indicate that any
<br>crime had been committed.
<br>
<br>¶6. (U) PP Foreign Relations Commission Spokesperson Gustavo
<br>Aristegui said that he supported the declassification of any
<br>relevant documents if they demonstrated the commission of an
<br>illegal act and if their release did not undermine the
<br>counter-terrorist operations. Aristegui said that democratic
<br>countries could not "resort to any type of illegal methods in
<br>the fight against terrorism" since this would only strengthen
<br>the terrorists. He pointed to Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib as
<br>"errors that should not be repeated."
<br>
<br>//PROSECUTOR DISCUSSES CIA FLIGHTS CASE WITH LEGAT//
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) The National Court prosecutor handling the CIA flights
<br>case, Vicente Gonzalez Mota (strictly protect), indicated to
<br>Legat that the prosecutors do not intend to request
<br>information on this case from the Embassy or from the USG in
<br>general. He said that the National Court prosecutors did not
<br>impede Judge Moreno's request to declassify the MOD or CNI
<br>records because it was clear that those records did not
<br>contain any incriminating or even particularly sensitive
<br>information. (NOTE: Vicente Gonzalez Mota is also the
<br>principal liaison to the Embassy for the Bilateral Counter
<br>Terrorism Experts Working Group. END NOTE). A January 31
<br>news report indicates that Gonzalez Mota filed a judcicial
<br>assistance request to Swiss authorities for any information
<br>(NFI) gathered by prosecutors in Bern that might have a
<br>bearing on the Spanish CIA flights investigation.
<br>
<br>//CONFLUENCE OF SPANISH-GERMAN INVESTIGATIONS//
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Spanish media reported widely on the detention order
<br>filed by German prosecutor Christian Schmidt-Sommerfeld
<br>against "13 alleged CIA members" for involvement in the
<br>"abduction and bodily harm" of German citizen Haled El Masri.
<br>Press reports indicate that German investigators obtained
<br>the 13 names from the Spanish Civil Guard on September 27,
<br>2006 during a visit to Spain by Munich prosecutor Martin
<br>Hoffman. The names had been included in a 2005 report
<br>ordered by a prosecutor in Palma de Mallorca. Some press
<br>reports indicated that while the names were presumed to be
<br>false, the Civil Guard had obtained photographs of at least
<br>three of the individuals from hotel records in Palma. It
<br>appears that Spanish daily "El Pais" also shared some of the
<br>names and other information it had gathered with German
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000173 003.2 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>investigators.
<br>
<br>//COMMENT//
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Despite the absence of evidence of a crime, or even of
<br>a clear direction in the National Court's CIA flights
<br>investigation, it is clear that the plaintiffs (which in
<br>Spain now include attorneys from the extreme left wing United
<br>Left) plan to keep this issue on the front burner. However,
<br>the most worrisome element of this episode is the joint
<br>timing of the announcemnts by the German prosecutors and
<br>Examining Magistrate in the Spanish CIA flights
<br>investigation, timing that suggests that they are
<br>coordinating to advance the cases in their respective
<br>jurisdictions. This coordination among independent
<br>investigators will complicate our efforts to manage this case
<br>at a discreet government-to-government level. With regard to
<br>the internal political dynamics on this issue, both major
<br>parties will be at pains to demonstrate their commitment to
<br>the rule of law. In spite of its general pro-U.S.
<br>orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not
<br>hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero
<br>Government tolerated or deliberately ignored USG actions that
<br>could be interpreted as possible human rights violations,
<br>even if these revelations reflect badly on the USG.
