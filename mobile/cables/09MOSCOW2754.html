<br>TAGS: PGOV PREL MARR
<br>SUBJECT: INFORMATION ON SECURITY DIALOGUE WITH RUSSIA
<br>
<br>REF: STATE 112900
<br>
<br>Classified By: Political M/C Susan M. Elliott for reasons 1.4 (b) and (
<br>d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) The USG and GOR have four existing, formal
<br>mechanisms for conducting security dialogues with the Russian
<br>Federation; all four are scheduled yearly.
<br>
<br>1) Joint Staff Talks (JSTs):  This event is hosted annually
<br>by U.S. Joint Staff J-5 or the GOR Chief of the Main OPS
<br>Directorate on a rotational basis.  The agenda is dynamic,
<br>but is typically focused on international military/security
<br>issues, mil-to-mil (M2M) cooperation, and transparency as
<br>nominated by the respective sides.
<br>
<br>2) Bilateral Defense Consultations (BDCs):  Hosted by ASD/ISA
<br>and the Director of International Relations, Russian MoD on a
<br>rotational basis.  Agenda is more policy and pol-mil
<br>oriented, but it is subject to items nominated by the
<br>respective sides.
<br>
<br>3) General Officer/Flag Officer Discussions (GO/FO):
<br>Alternatively hosted by EUCOM J5 and GOR MoD equivalent;
<br>agenda is more narrowly focused on AOR issues and developing
<br>direction for construction of the bilateral workplan (WP).
<br>
<br>4) US-GOR Colonels Working Group (CWG):  Objective is to
<br>discuss and nominate events for the following year's WP.  In
<br>practice, they meet more than once per year, alternating
<br>sites between Stuttgart and Moscow.
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) In addition, as a result of the Presidential summit
<br>in Moscow in July, the Presidents directed their respective
<br>senior military officers to establish a military-to-military
<br>working group under the auspices of the Bilateral
<br>Presidential Commission.  The primary objective of this group
<br>will be to enhance military cooperation consistent with the
<br>Presidents' broader cooperative agenda.
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) In practice, CJSC and CHOD will conduct 2-3 day
<br>counterpart visits every other year, with discussion agendas
<br>and visit venues to be determined by the respective sides.
<br>Ad hoc engagements vary, based upon interests of the
<br>respective sides.  In the past these have included:
<br>
<br>--STRATCOM-Strategic Rocket Forces;
<br>
<br>--U.S. Air Forces Europe-GOR Air Force;
<br>
<br>--NORTHCOM/NORAD-RF Air Force;
<br>
<br>-Incidents at sea/Main Navy Staff talks between U.S. and
<br>Russia;
<br>
<br>-GO/FO delegation exchanges between EUCOM Component Commands
<br>and elements of the Russian Armed Forces.
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) We believe dialogue was first established by mutual
<br>consent in the late 1980s.  The frequency of these meetings
<br>has been determined by informal understanding.
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) The most recent CJCS-CHOD security dialogue meeting
<br>came when the CJCS came to Moscow July 6-9.  No set schedule
<br>determines the frequency of such meetings, but the event is
<br>placed on the WP and dates are left to respective sides to
<br>negotiate.  The next scheduled meetings are:
<br>
<br>--JSTs:  December 14-18;
<br>
<br>--BDCs:  Although featured as an event on the 2009 WP, they
<br>will probably not be executed this year due to ongoing
<br>military reforms and personnel shifts within GOR MoD;
<br>
<br>--GO/FO Consultations:  TBD;
<br>
<br>--CWG: November 17-19;
<br>
<br>--INCSEA/Main Navy Staff Talks:  December 10-11 in Moscow.
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) The USG and GOR expect officers to meet with their
<br>rank/position equivalents.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C/NF) While useful and meaningful exchanges do take place
<br>during the contacts discussed above, a number of challenges
<br>
<br>MOSCOW 00002754  002 OF 002
<br>
<br>in effecting real, substantive and ongoing
<br>Military-to-Military (M2M) dialogues exist.  These challenges
<br>include:
<br>
<br>1) Lack of Russian transparency and reciprocity:  The GOR MoD
<br>has not changed its modus operandi for information exchange
<br>nor routine dialoguing since the end of the Cold War.  For
<br>example, Russian delegations routinely refuse to share their
<br>briefing materials with us, even when presented with formal
<br>requests for these materials.  Representatives of the GOR MoD
<br>are closely monitored by their Military Intelligence (GRU)
<br>handlers, and are loathe to engage in any dialogues outside
<br>of tightly controlled statements recited from prepared texts.
<br>While U.S. hosts will often invite Russian MoD delegations
<br>to different bases for tours and exchanges, U.S. delegations
<br>are rarely afforded visits anywhere but dedicated conference
<br>facilities at MoD HQ in Moscow.  Access to Russian academic
<br>institutions is particularly problematic.  Visiting U.S.
<br>delegations from Senior Service Schools are afforded, at
<br>best, a one-hour visit at MoD HQ to meet with a single
<br>representative of the GOR MoD External Liaison Division.
<br>Despite deliberate U.S. transparency regarding its actions in
<br>Russia's "near abroad," the Russian MoD is loathe to provide
<br>information about its activities.  A recent example occurred
<br>over the last six months:  while the US provided information
<br>to Russia concerning our limited training activities with the
<br>Georgian Armed Forces, Russia provided no information
<br>regarding a series of Collective Security Treaty Organization
<br>exercises occurring in Belarus and Kazakhstan involving some
<br>12,000 Russian troops.
<br>
<br>2) Coordinating DoD Relations with Russia:  Russia was
<br>integrated into the EUCOM AOR as a result of the publication
<br>of the 2002 Unified Command Plan (UCP).  Russia, however,
<br>resents the "delegation" of its relations to a "regional
<br>command" and refuses to interract with EUCOM on a continuing,
<br>formal basis.  DoD efforts to date have managed to gain some
<br>recognition by Russia of EUCOM's role in the M2M
<br>relationship.  For example, Russia has not accepted
<br>initiatives to conduct a COM EUCOM-CHOD exchange.  Efforts
<br>need to continue along these lines to formalize the
<br>relationship.
<br>
<br>3) Lack of Continuity/Followup:  While exchanges with the
<br>Russians have been executed according to the U.S.-Russia
<br>Bilateral Workplan (WP), they have suffered from a lack of
<br>continuity.  This is often characterized by a lack of
<br>formally acknowledged minute and action items.  In many ways,
<br>every meeting therefore is similar to a "restart" of a new
<br>forum, rather than a continuation of an extablished venue
<br>with review of previous business, followup actions, etc.
