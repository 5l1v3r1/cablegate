<br>SUBJECT: MOROCCO'S MILITARY: ADEQUATE, MODERNIZING, BUT 
<br>FACING BIG CHALLENGES 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Classified by Ambassador Thomas T. Riley for reasons 1.4 
<br> (a) and (b). 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (C) Summary:  The Moroccan Royal Armed Forces (FAR) are 
<br>modernizing but remain weighed down by long-standing 
<br>problems.  King Mohammed VI, who in 1999 inherited a military 
<br>in need of professionalization, has implemented some needed 
<br>reforms, but much remains to be done.  Civilian control, if 
<br>ascribed to the person of the King, is complete, but there is 
<br>no real Defense Ministry.  Outside the FAR, there is only a 
<br>small administration.  The military remains plagued by 
<br>corruption, an inefficient bureaucracy, low levels of 
<br>education in the ranks, periodic threats of radicalization of 
<br>some of its soldiers, political marginalization, and the 
<br>deployment of most of its forces in the Western Sahara. 
<br>There have been some indications of pending changes in the 
<br>leadership.  In general, the U.S. and Morocco share a robust 
<br>military relationship with prospects for even closer ties in 
<br>the future.  The health of the relationship is evident by 
<br>increased U.S.-Moroccan military training exercises and 
<br>Morocco's purchase of sophisticated weapons from the U.S. to 
<br>include 24 F-16s this year.  We anticipate that the 
<br>U.S.-Moroccan military relationship will continue to flourish 
<br>but Morocco's ability to absorb its new high-end military 
<br>purchases and restrictions on high quality Moroccan 
<br>information sharing with our attaches represent two 
<br>challenges ahead.  This mission-coordinated report draws 
<br>heavily on valuable reporting and analysis from the embassy's 
<br>military components, the Defense Attache Office and the 
<br>Office of Security Cooperation.  End Summary. 
<br> 
<br>------------------ 
<br>All the King's Men 
<br>------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (C) As Commander-in-Chief of the Moroccan Royal Armed 
<br>Forces and Minister of Defense, King Mohammed VI maintains a 
<br>highly centralized role over the military.  No troop 
<br>movements, exercises, or even travel of officers domestically 
<br>or abroad happens without the King,s approval.  As a result 
<br>of the 1971 and 1972 coup attempts by the Moroccan Army and 
<br>Air Force respectively, the Palace increased control over the 
<br>military, marginalized it from policy making, and restricted 
<br>its interaction with foreign military interlocutors and the 
<br>press.  The Alaouite dynasty depends upon, among other 
<br>things, a strong military, the leadership of which, however, 
<br>must remain sufficiently docile so as not to arouse 
<br>suspicions of disloyalty.  The only civilian structure 
<br>responsible for the FAR is not a Defense Ministry but rather 
<br>an entity under the Prime Minister responsible for the 
<br>Administration of the National Defense.  It is headed by 
<br>Minister-delegate Abderrahmane Sbai, whose role is 
<br>essentially restricted to that of comptroller.  As far as we 
<br>can tell, political-military policy on issues such as 
<br>peacekeeping appears centered in the Foreign Ministry.  All 
<br>other major defense matters are decided in the Palace. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C) Over the past decade, Morocco has transitioned from a 
<br>conscript to an all-volunteer military force of approximately 
<br>218,000 soldiers.  Of the three services, the Army is 
<br>dominant with approximately 175,000 personnel.  There are 
<br>approximately 13,000 personnel in the Air Force and 7,800 in 
<br>the Navy.  Though nominally subordinate within the military 
<br>structure but answering directly to the King, the 
<br>Gendarmerie, which consists of approximately 22,000 
<br>personnel, conducts paramilitary, royal guard, and internal 
<br>and border policing missions.  Though a few legacy conscripts 
<br>remain in the military, professional reforms have made 
<br>voluntary military service an attractive career option for 
<br>Moroccans with opportunities for a steady income and some 
<br>upward mobility.  The average military salary for enlisted 
<br>soldiers is approximately 2,000 dirhams (USD 270) per month. 
<br>An officer's starting salary is approximately 6,000 dirhams 
<br>(USD 850) per month.  With benefits, such as free housing, 
<br>these are reasonably competitive in the Moroccan context. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (C) The top military commanders include Military 
<br>Inspector General and Army Commander, Lieutenant General (Lt 
<br>Gen) Abdelaziz Benanni; Operations Chief Lt Gen Boughaid 
<br>Arroub; and Gendarmerie Commander Lt Gen Housni Benslimane. 
<br>Benanni, who has become mired in suspicion of corruption, 
<br>will reportedly be retired soon.  Arroub, who came out of 
<br>recent retirement, is tipped by some to succeed Benanni. 
<br>Arroub, historically pro-French, appears to have become 
<br>increasingly pro-U.S. in the last 5 years.  Another rising 
<br>star in the FAR is General Mohamed Larbi Tamdi, who is 
<br>responsible for army logistics and force sustainment.  There 
<br>is some military staff in the Palace, likely influent, about 
<br>which little is known. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (C) King Hassan II and his son, King Mohammed VI, have 
<br>maintained the Gendarmerie as a force relatively independent 
<br>from the FAR since 1972, in part as a check against a 
<br>military coup.  While it most visibly serves as a State 
<br>Police/Highway Patrol, it has a wide range of units.  Its 
<br>commander, Lt Gen Benslimane, likely reports in some way 
<br>directly to the King.  He also leads the Moroccan National 
<br>Soccer League, making him a popular figure inside and out of 
<br>military circles.  While there is no direct proof of 
<br>Benslimane being involved in corrupt activity, low ranking 
<br>Gendarmerie assigned to highway patrols are expected to pay 
<br>approximately 4,000 dirhams (USD 540) to their immediate 
<br>supervisors with extralegal earnings from motorists above 
<br>which they can keep for themselves, according to one credible 
<br>anecdote. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -- 
<br>Military Operations Dominated by Western Sahara 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -- 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (C) The FAR is composed of over 200,000 soldiers and 
<br>outclasses most militaries in Africa but has significant room 
<br>for improvement.  Along with concerns regarding aging 
<br>equipment and an overtaxed force, the FAR is plagued by 
<br>institutional corruption, leadership that will not step 
<br>aside, and low morale among mid-level officers.  The FAR is 
<br>preoccupied with operations in the Western Sahara region with 
<br>between 50 and 70 percent of its total strength deployed 
<br>there at any one time.  The force in Western Sahara -- a 
<br>landmass roughly two thirds the size of California -- is 
<br>considered to be stretched thin with a reported estimated 
<br>operational readiness rate of just 40 percent.  Morocco does 
<br>not consider the POLISARIO -- the ethnically Sahrawi 
<br>resistance based in Tindouf, Algeria, seeking to make the 
<br>Western Sahara an independent state -- to be a conventional 
<br>military threat.  However, the FAR remains vigilant in 
<br>guarding against a renewed POLISARIO insurgency effort. 
<br>Morocco built a berm or sand wall along the eastern and 
<br>southern borders of the Sahara in the 1980s, which 
<br>effectively eliminated the POLISARIO's ability to launch hit 
<br>and run raids, leading to the 1981 cease-fire, which has been 
<br>fully respected.  The POLISARIO continues to maintain a 
<br>small, lightly armed presence at a few desert crossroads in 
<br>the small remaining part of Western Sahara outside the berm. 
<br>Despite occasional expressions of concern, the GOM almost 
<br>certainly is fully conscious that the POLISARIO poses no 
<br>current threat that could not be effectively countered.  The 
<br>POLISARIO has generally refrained from classic terrorist 
<br>bombings, etc.  Although the specter is sometimes raised, 
<br>there is no indication of any Salafist/Al Qaeda activity 
<br>among the indigenous Sahrawi population. 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (C) While the border between Morocco and Algeria is 
<br>closed, and relations remain cool, we do not believe that 
<br>Algeria poses an imminent conventional military threat to 
<br>Morocco.  Nonetheless, the FAR has contingency plans and 
<br>"wargames" in training exercises for a possible Algerian 
<br>attack, but the FAR does not have troops deployed along the 
<br>border.  Instead, the FAR remains stationed in garrisons, 
<br>hundreds of kilometers away from the border, from which they 
<br>could deploy in the unlikely event of an Algerian incursion 
<br>into Morocco.  Any confrontation between the two countries 
<br>would likely take place through the proxy of the POLISARIO, 
<br>which Algeria has supported materially in the past and could 
<br>do so again if hostilities between Morocco and the POLISARIO 
<br>recommenced. 
<br> 
<br>------------ 
<br>Peacekeeping 
<br>------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (C) Motivated to win over other countries to its claims 
<br>to Western Sahara, Morocco is active in United Nations (UN), 
<br>engages in peacekeeping activities, and occasionally sends 
<br>troops to assist friendly countries.  Morocco is an 
<br>experienced contributor to UN peacekeeping efforts, deploying 
<br>to countries like Angola, Bosnia, Cambodia, Haiti and 
<br>Somalia.  It currently has over 1,500 peacekeepers deployed 
<br>to Cote d,Ivoire and the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
<br>(DRC).  Morocco also supports a military hospital in Kosovo 
<br>under NATO command.  Morocco has sent medical personnel to 
<br>Niger to assist with famine relief and recently re-deployed 
<br>military forces to Senegal for an annual five-month &cloud 
<br>seeding8 operation for drought relief.  Peacekeeping 
<br>contributions in recent years have been tarnished by 
<br>allegations of sexual wrongdoing in the DRC and Cote 
<br>d,Ivoire. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- --- 
<br>Corruption Remains the Single Greatest Challenge 
<br>--------------------------------------------- --- 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (C) Corruption is prevalent at all levels of Moroccan 
<br>society and the military is also plagued by it, particularly 
<br>at the highest levels.  This may partly reflect a grand 
<br>bargain struck by King Hassan II following at least two 
<br>nearly successful coups in the 1970's:  remain loyal, and you 
<br>can profit.  (Those whose loyalty was in question were 
<br>subject to sometimes decades of harsh imprisonment.) 
<br>Credible reports indicate that Lt Gen Benanni is using his 
<br>position as the Commander of the Southern Sector to skim 
<br>money from military contracts and influence business 
<br>decisions.  A widely believed rumor has it that he owns large 
<br>parts of the fisheries in Western Sahara.  Benanni, like many 
<br>senior military officers, has a lavish family home that was 
<br>likely built with money gleaned from bribes.  Leadership 
<br>positions in regional sectors are a significant source of 
<br>extralegal income for military leaders.  There are even 
<br>reports of students at Morocco's military academy paying 
<br>money to increase their class standings in order to obtain 
<br>positions in lucrative military postings.  Command in the 
<br>southern sector, i.e., Western Sahara, given the predominance 
<br>of military activity there, is considered to be the most 
<br>lucrative of the sectors in this regard.  Because command in 
<br>the southern sector is also considered critical to high level 
<br>advancement in the FAR, positions there are highly sought 
<br>after.  Consequently, positions in this sector are often 
<br>jealously "guarded" by a number of influential families in 
<br>the military.  The GOM seems to be looking for ways to stop 
<br>corruption, especially among the formative military ranks of 
<br>Colonel and below, but not much is being done to stop the 
<br>corruption in the general officer ranks. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------------------- 
<br>Retiring High Level Officers Also a Problem 
<br>------------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (C) Senior officers refusing to retire to allow younger 
<br>officers to move up the ranks has become a significant 
<br>problem for the FAR.  Officers nearing the mandatory 
<br>retirement age do not want to retire since this would mean 
<br>relinquishing bribes, money-skimming, and some related 
<br>sources of income.  Even for those officers not &on the 
<br>take,8 giving up government positions and paychecks is 
<br>economically difficult for a sustained retirement.  This 
<br>"gerontocracy" problem, coupled with the King's notorious 
<br>micro-management of the military has had a negative impact on 
<br>the morale of mid-level military leaders. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
<br>Radicalization:  Under Control But Lingering Menace 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
<br> 
<br>¶11.  (C) Though now viewed as a minor problem, reporting 
<br>suggests that small numbers of FAR soldiers remains 
<br>susceptible to Islamic radicalization.  The GOM first 
<br>encountered this problem following the 2003 Casablanca 
<br>bombings when investigators identified military members as 
<br>co-conspirators.  Following the bombings, the FAR undertook 
<br>steps to identify extremists and implement preventative 
<br>measures, such as closing prayer halls on military bases, to 
<br>address the problem.  Subsequently, Morocco,s internal 
<br>security services have identified and apprehended several 
<br>military and gendarmerie personnel in other terrorist cells, 
<br>some of whom had stolen weapons from their bases for 
<br>terrorism.  Acknowledging this threat in a speech to the 
<br>armed forces in May 2008, the King stated his desire to 
<br>"immunize" the armed forces from the threat of radicalization 
<br>and to promote the values of tolerance and moderation in the 
<br>ranks.  During this same time frame the military forced 30 
<br>officers to retire early, allegedly because they were deemed 
<br>potentially radical and hostile to the Government. 
<br>Subsequently, the FAR removed all mosques from army bases and 
<br>deployed military counterintelligence, i.e., 5th Bureau, 
<br>undercover officers to monitor local "off-post" mosques for 
<br>potentially radical activities.  These officers refer cases 
<br>to the Gendarmerie if criminal charges can be pursued. 
<br> 
<br>--------------- 
<br>Winds of Change 
<br>--------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶12.  (C) Since the 1970's the military itself has been 
<br>perceived as the greatest threat to the throne and internal 
<br>security in Morocco, not surprising given Morocco's own 
<br>history and the broader context of the coup-ridden Middle 
<br>East and Africa.  Of late, however, there is a general 
<br> 
<br>perception that the relationship between the Palace and the 
<br>FAR is beginning to change to one of greater trust.  The 
<br>King's growing confidence is partly signaled by a recent 
<br>significant increase in military spending, particularly for 
<br>modern hardware, although this is primarily a function of the 
<br>GOM's perceived threat from Algeria and the fact that it is 
<br>cost prohibitive at a certain point to maintain older 
<br>military equipment.  The GOM increased the military's 
<br>operating budget to more than USD 2 billion in 2007, 
<br>significantly more than in previous years.  Likewise, the FAR 
<br>is undergoing a significant modernization process, paying 
<br>over USD 2 billion for 24 F-16 aircraft and over USD 300 
<br>million for T-6 training aircraft from the U.S.  The GOM has 
<br>commercially financed these transactions, thus far, but the 
<br>upfront payments have come from the treasury, which has also 
<br>committed to cover monthly payments.  The King recently 
<br>allowed armed military flights north of Ben Guerir (located 
<br>approximately 200 kilometers south of Rabat), an act not 
<br>permitted in the past due to the King,s desire to keep the 
<br>military far away from the Palace in Rabat.  The GOM is also 
<br>looking to make significant purchases of M-1 Abrams battle 
<br>tanks in the future. 
<br> 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>U.S.-Moroccan Military Relations 
<br>   Strong but Could Be Better 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶13.  (C) In general, the U.S. and Morocco share a robust 
<br>military relationship with prospects for even closer ties in 
<br>the future.  The health of the relationship is evidenced by 
<br>increased U.S.-Moroccan military training exercises and the 
<br>aforementioned military sales.  Morocco has also increased 
<br>its activities under a partnership arrangement with the Utah 
<br>National Guard, which regularly deploys to Morocco to conduct 
<br>joint training and humanitarian relief operations.  We have 
<br>submitted draft proposed language for the Moroccans to 
<br>consider for an Acquisition and Cross Servicing Agreement 
<br>(ACSA) and a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), and have 
<br>received comments on the ACSA draft from the GOM.  In the 
<br>future, the Embassy hopes to see improvements in the FAR's 
<br>information sharing and accessibility to military units and 
<br>facilities with our Defense Attache Office.  Although the FAR 
<br>regularly dialogues with our attaches, quality information is 
<br>lacking.  The FAR also does not recognize the Embassy Attache 
<br>circle, an organization of Military Attaches from various 
<br>countries residing in Morocco who elect a president to 
<br>discuss issues of collective concern with the FAR.  It is 
<br>apparent that the Palace continues to tightly control the 
<br>FAR's interactions U.S. and other foreign governments. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>AFRICOM Viewed with Caution 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶14.  (C) Previous interactions with GOM officials indicate 
<br>that military leaders are opposed to AFRICOM basing a 
<br>headquarters element in Morocco.  However, Morocco has 
<br>offered to send a military liaison officer to the AFRICOM 
<br>headquarters in Germany and has offered to assist U.S.-led 
<br>efforts engaging with African countries.  Morocco has also 
<br>approached AFRICOM representatives to solicit AFRICOM support 
<br>in providing chemicals needed for their cloud-seeding 
<br>operations in Senegal and providing logistics to assist with 
<br>a proposed locust control program. 
<br> 
<br>------- 
<br>COMMENT 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶15.  (C) The Mission is optimistic that the U.S.-Moroccan 
<br>military relationship will continue to improve, but there are 
<br>potential speed bumps in future.  We anticipate that 
<br>cooperative joint training exercises will continue to occur 
<br>at a robust pace, although the vast majority of this activity 
<br>will likely take place in Morocco because of continued 
<br>restrictions on the travel of FAR personnel.  While we 
<br>anticipate that the Palace will continue to modernize the 
<br>military, with the notable possible acquisition of M-1 Abrams 
<br>tanks, we are increasingly concerned that Morocco, not used 
<br>to the high operating costs of these high end items (and 
<br>other budgetary pressures) may make it increasingly difficult 
<br>for the Moroccans to make payments on purchases.  If payments 
<br>become a problem for the GOM, this could sour relations 
<br>temporarily.  While we believe that there are some signs of 
<br>the King's increased confidence in the FAR, we believe that 
<br>the monarchy still calculates that the military represents 
<br>the biggest potential threat to the crown.  FAR officers 
<br>will, therefore, continue to be distanced from policy making 
<br> 
<br>input and restricted from engaging in detailed discussions 
<br>about Moroccan military strength and intentions with foreign 
<br>military officers, including our attaches.
