<br>SUBJECT: TURKEY'S FOREIGN POLICY SPLIT - THE PM'S CIRCLE TO 
<br>THE FORE 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: DCM Nancy McEldowney, reasons 1.4 (b), (d) 
<br> 
<br>1.(C)  The long-standing split between the professional MFA 
<br>diplomats and the tight circle of advisers around PM Erdogan 
<br>has widened noticeably in recent weeks.  This gap has existed 
<br>under Erdogan,s Justice and Development Party (AKP) 
<br>government, largely because of the close links that both PM 
<br>Erdogan and FM Gul have with PM adviser Davutoglu, who has 
<br>been willing to undertake numerous initiatives.  Until 
<br>recently, however, such strains have usually been more 
<br>effectively papered over.  This internal debate now affects 
<br>every step the GOT takes on the international stage. 
<br> 
<br>2.(C) The Turkish diplomatic corps is highly educated and 
<br>well attuned to what will sell in the U.S. or Europe; less so 
<br>on the domestic political front.  PM Erdogan,s core of AKP 
<br>advisers, including Davutoglu and the AKP vice chairs, 
<br>understand what will play well with their constituencies. 
<br>Their sense of how policy will play outside of Ankara is 
<br>handicapped, however, by their Turkey- and Islam-centric 
<br>vision of how they want the world to operate. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C/NF)  Decoupling MFA from the PM,s advisers can produce 
<br>a greater willingness to take chances.  At the same time, it 
<br>can also create greater room for misunderstandings or 
<br>wrongfooted efforts.  In the run-up to the February 2006 
<br>Hamas visit to Ankara, for example, MFA was kept in the dark. 
<br> The AKPers who dealt with the visit did so in a haphazard 
<br>and uncoordinated manner.  MFA, uninformed, was unable to 
<br>preview it with us.  The backlash from the U.S. in particular 
<br>truly took AKP aback.  It took weeks -) even months -) 
<br>before limited understanding dawned on the depth of the 
<br>displeasure the Hamas venture had spawned, and why.  It did 
<br>not (and still does not) fit within their frame of reference. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C/NF)  Most startling, perhaps, to AKP were those in the 
<br>U.S. and elsewhere who, in the aftermath of the Hamas visit, 
<br>asked how AKP would feel if we met with PKK leaders.  For 
<br>Erdogan,s circle, it is not analogous: for them, terrorism 
<br>equals the PKK.  It is difficult for PM Erdogan to believe 
<br>that his philanthropist Islamic friend Al Kadi could be 
<br>involved in terrorist financing, just as it is alien to their 
<br>frame of reference to view specific Islamic groups as 
<br>terrorists.  Hamas and Hizballah are the result of western 
<br>policies gone awry, a response from desperate people )- not 
<br>truly terrorists.  Allow them to talk reason to these people, 
<br>exert Turkish influence, and the Hamases of the world will 
<br>change.  This has been evident in other Turkish efforts 
<br>throughout the region as well -- with Iran (FM Mottaki,s 
<br>visit here; Erdogan,s talks with Ahmedinejad on the margins 
<br>of international conferences); with Syria (the Turks believe 
<br>they were instrumental in getting Syria,s Asad to agree to 
<br>pull troops out of Lebanon, and to certain aspects of the 
<br>Hariri investigation); with the current conflict in Lebanon 
<br>and the Gaza strip. 
<br> 
<br>5.(C/NF) A more recent example of the PM circle-MFA 
<br>disconnect involved Davutoglu,s trip to Damascus the first 
<br>week of July, where he met not only with Asad but Misha,al 
<br>as well.  The MFA was cut out and furious (their Ambassador 
<br>to Damascus reportedly cooled his heels outside while 
<br>Davutoglu met with Asad). 
<br> 
<br>6.(C) As the Israel-Lebanon crisis intensified, so has this 
<br>tendency within Erdogan,s small circle.  AKP sees own its 
<br>back to the public opinion wall.  Instead of exercising 
<br>leadership, Erdogan -- in populist pre-election mode -- has 
<br>followed.  He is playing to AKP,s constituency; to those 
<br>within the party who have never been positively inclined 
<br>toward Israel; and to the greater regional Sunni audience 
<br>that he is trying to court.  Two early results, aimed at 
<br>these audiences, were (1) the PM,s participation in the 
<br>August 3 extraordinary OIC executive council meetin in Kuala 
<br>Lumpur, where he again met with Irnian president Ahmedinejad 
<br>and uttered strong anti-Israeli statements; and (2) FM Gul,s 
<br>August 3 op-ed piece in the Washington Post, which aired GOT 
<br>ire in an unhelpful way and blindsided the professional 
<br>Turkish diplomats in Washington. 
<br> 
<br>7.(C/NF) Complicit or not (we believe the former), Gul has 
<br>had his name sullied by a number of these efforts.  He  will 
<br>have to decide whether to give the MFA renewed weight -) 
<br> 
<br>Foreign Ministry officials could be key in bridging certain 
<br>delicate issues, particularly Cyprus, with both the 
<br>government and the military, for example -) or go with the 
<br>PM,s circle.
