<br>SUBJECT: (S) FLIGHT OF PROLIFERATION CONCERN BETWEEN DPRK 
<br>AND IRAN 
<br> 
<br>REF: ASTANA 1286 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: ISN Acting DAS Kenneth W. Staley, 
<br>Reasons 1.4 (b), (c), and (d) 
<br> 
<br>THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST.  SEE PARA 2. 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (S) Posts are requested to approach appropriate-level host 
<br>nation officials regarding a planned North Korean flight to 
<br>Iran of proliferation concern and encourage them to deny 
<br>overflight for the aircraft or require that it land and be 
<br>subjected to inspection before proceeding.  Posts may draw 
<br>from background, objectives, and talking points/non-paper 
<br>below as appropriate. 
<br> 
<br>---------- 
<br>OBJECTIVES 
<br>---------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (S//REL AFGHANISTAN, KYRGYZSTAN, TAJIKISTAN, 
<br>TURKMENISTAN, UZBEKISTAN):  Posts should encourage host 
<br>governments, as partner nations in the Proliferation Security 
<br>Initiative (PSI) and consistent with their obligations under 
<br>UNSCRs 1718, 1737, and 1747, to deny overflight or to insist 
<br>that the aircraft land for inspection before proceeding. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (S//REL CHINA) Embassy Beijing should encourage China, 
<br>consistent with its obligations under UNSCRs 1718, 1737, and 
<br>1747, to deny overflight or to insist that the aircraft land 
<br>for inspection before proceeding. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (S//REL KAZAKHSTAN) Our information currently does not 
<br>indicate a North Korean intent to overfly Kazakhstan, 
<br>suggesting that GOK, per REFTEL, has denied the DPRK,s 
<br>request.  Embassy Astana is requested to express appreciation 
<br>for GOK,s proactively notifying us of the DPRK overflight 
<br>request and urge them to deny any such request if they have 
<br>not already done so.  Post may share the below non-paper with 
<br>GOK, as appropriate. 
<br> 
<br>---------- 
<br>BACKGROUND 
<br>---------- 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (S//REL CHINA, AFGHANISTAN, KAZAKHSTAN, KYRGYZSTAN, 
<br>TAJIKISTAN, TURKMENISTAN, UZBEKISTAN)  The USG has received 
<br>information that a flight of proliferation concern between 
<br>North Korea and Iran is scheduled to occur in late July. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (S//REL AFGHANISTAN, KAZAKHSTAN, TAJIKISTAN) Our 
<br>information does not currently indicate a North Korean intent 
<br>to route the flight over Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, or 
<br>Tajikistan.  We are, however, providing them this information 
<br>in the spirit of our cooperation under PSI, and to ask them 
<br>to deny overflight or inspect the aircraft in the event the 
<br>North Koreans re-route the flight. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (S) Embassies should note that bullet #1 is for Beijing 
<br>only, bullet #2 is for all recipients except Beijing, and 
<br>bullet #3 is for Astana, Kabul, and Dushanbe only.  The rest 
<br>of the non-paper is for all recipients. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------ 
<br>TALKING POINTS/NON-PAPER 
<br>------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (S//REL CHINA, AFGHANISTAN, KAZAKHSTAN, KYRGYZSTAN, 
<br>TAJIKISTAN, TURKMENISTAN, UZBEKISTAN) Begin talking 
<br>points/non-paper: 
<br> 
<br>-- (S//REL CHINA) We would like to raise with you a North 
<br>Korean flight of proliferation concern that may request 
<br>overflight of your territory as it transits to and from Iran. 
<br> 
<br>-- (S//REL AFGHANISTAN, KAZAKHSTAN, KYRGYZSTAN, TAJIKISTAN, 
<br>TURKMENISTAN, UZBEKISTAN) In the spirit of our cooperation 
<br>under the Proliferation Security Initiative, we would like to 
<br>raise with you a North Korean flight of proliferation concern 
<br>that may request overflight of your territory as it transits 
<br>to and from Iran. 
<br> 
<br>-- (S//REL AFGHANISTAN, KAZAKHSTAN, TAJIKISTAN) While our 
<br>current information indicates that this flight will not cross 
<br>your territory, we are providing it to you in the spirit of 
<br>our cooperation as PSI partners and in the event that the 
<br>flight,s schedule is changed and you do receive a North 
<br>Korean overflight request. 
<br> 
<br>-- (S//REL CHINA, AFGHANISTAN, KAZAKHSTAN, KYRGYZSTAN, 
<br>TAJIKISTAN, TURKMENISTAN, UZBEKISTAN) We are concerned that 
<br>this chartered, round-trip passenger flight may be carrying 
<br>DPRK personnel involved in ongoing cooperation with Iran on 
<br>ballistic missiles. 
<br> 
<br>-- (S//REL CHINA, AFGHANISTAN, KAZAKHSTAN, KYRGYZSTAN, 
<br>TAJIKISTAN, TURKMENISTAN, UZBEKISTAN) As you know, the 
<br>transfer by North Korea of WMD components or delivery 
<br>systems, certain military goods, and related materials 
<br>including spare parts, is prohibited by UNSCR 1718.  UNSCR 
<br>1718 also prohibits transfers from or to North Korea of 
<br>technical training, advice, services or assistance related to 
<br>WMD, their delivery systems, and certain conventional arms. 
<br>Iran is prohibited from obtaining WMD, delivery systems, 
<br>related components, and related technical assistance and 
<br>training under UNSCRs 1737 and 1747. 
<br> 
<br>-- (S//REL CHINA, AFGHANISTAN, KAZAKHSTAN, KYRGYZSTAN, 
<br>TAJIKISTAN, TURKMENISTAN, UZBEKISTAN) We therefore request 
<br>that overflight permission be denied or made contingent on 
<br>inspection of the aircraft to ensure that any cargo or 
<br>passengers it carries are not arriving in Iran in violation 
<br>of UNSCR 1718, 1737, 1747 or other UN resolutions. 
<br>Alternately, if this aircraft requests a fueling stop in your 
<br>country, we request that you grant this permission and 
<br>promptly search the aircraft upon its arrival for evidence of 
<br>prohibited items or activities. 
<br> 
<br>-- (S//REL CHINA, AFGHANISTAN, KAZAKHSTAN, KYRGYZSTAN, 
<br>TAJIKISTAN, TURKMENISTAN, UZBEKISTAN) Information about the 
<br>flights are as follows.  The outbound flight from the DPRK is 
<br>expected on or about July 31, 2008.  The aircraft is a North 
<br>Korean-registered Il-62, flight JS-621, scheduled to depart 
<br>Pyongyang on 28 July at 0001Z and land in Tehran at 0940Z. 
<br> 
<br>-- (S//REL CHINA, AFGHANISTAN, KAZAKHSTAN, KYRGYZSTAN, 
<br>TAJIKISTAN, TURKMENISTAN, UZBEKISTAN) From North Korea, the 
<br>flight is scheduled to pass into Chinese airspace at or about 
<br>0025Z and leave Chinese airspace for Kyrgyzstan at 0600Z. 
<br>From there, the flight is scheduled to pass over Uzbekistan 
<br>and Turkmenistan and arrive in Iranian airspace at or around 
<br>0825Z. 
<br> 
<br>-- (S//REL CHINA, AFGHANISTAN, KAZAKHSTAN, KYRGYZSTAN, 
<br>TAJIKISTAN, TURKMENISTAN, UZBEKISTAN) The return flight, 
<br>JS-622, is scheduled to depart Tehran on 31 July at 1330Z and 
<br>arrive at Pyongyang at 2220Z. 
<br> 
<br>-- (S//REL CHINA, AFGHANISTAN, KAZAKHSTAN, KYRGYZSTAN, 
<br>TAJIKISTAN, TURKMENISTAN, UZBEKISTAN) From Iran, the flight 
<br>is scheduled to pass into Turkmenistan airspace on or about 
<br>1440Z and pass over Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, entering 
<br>Chinese airspace from Kyrgyzstan at 1655Z.  From there the 
<br>flight is scheduled to re-enter North Korean airspace on or 
<br>around 2200Z.
