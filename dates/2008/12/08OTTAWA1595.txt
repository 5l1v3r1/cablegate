MESSAGE 
 
REF: A. OTTAWA 1590 
     ¶B. STATE 132044 
 
Classified By: PolMinCouns Scott Bellard, reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1. (C)  Canada shares U.S. concerns over the flawed 
November municipal elections (reftels), but will not 
contemplate cutting its annual aid worth about C$11 million 
or canceling official visits, according to Department of 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) Nicaragua 
desk officer Sande Ewart.  He added that, with "Ortega 
thumbing his nose at the United States's $64 million in aid 
money," Canada found it unlikely that suspending its aid 
disbursements would achieve anything positive. 
 
¶2.  (C)  Ewart explained that Canada instead seeks to use 
the January 13 visit to Nicaragua by Minister of State for 
the Americas Peter Kent to highlight Canadian concerns over 
the flawed November municipal elections.  Canada's Embassy 
in Costa Rica, which also covers Nicaragua, has been 
seeking a meeting for Kent with President Ortega, so far 
without success.  Ortega's staff appears to wish to block 
the meeting on principle, Ewart noted, because they want 
him to meet only with other heads of government.  If Kent 
does meet with Ortega, Ewart said that he would stick 
closely to the language in Canada's recent OAS "strong" 
statement on the elections, which underscored Canada's 
emphasis on good governance (one of the three pillars of 
Prime Minister Harper's Americas strategy).  Ewart 
emphasized that Canada was keen to get its message across 
directly to Ortega, but admitted that DFAIT also wants Kent 
out of Nicaragua before the January 15 inauguration of the 
supposed victors in the flawed municipal elections.
