SUBJECT: UNSC: COUNCIL AGREES ON ELEMENTS FOR PRESIDENCY TO 
READ TO PRESS ON SITUATION IN HEBRON 
 
REF: JERUSALEM 2198 
 
¶1.  (SBU) In consultations late on December 5, the Security 
Council agreed not to meet formally in response to requests 
by the Palestinians through the Non-Aligned Movement and the 
Arab Group for a Council meeting on recent settler violence 
in the Hebron area of the West Bank.  In lieu of a meeting, 
Council members agreed to a U.S.-proposal to have the Council 
President (Croatia) read out elements of the discussion to 
the press, which were drafted by USUN and coordinated in 
advance with the Israeli and Libyan delegations. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) During the consultations, the Libyan Perm Rep spoke 
first about the reasons for holding a meeting but noted after 
the U.S. intervention that a statement, such as the one 
proposed by the U.S., would be acceptable.  Ambassador Wolff 
spoke next on our understanding of the events in Hebron and 
proposed the draft oral remarks.  Every Council member 
subsequently spoke in favor of the U.S./Libya draft language, 
with only the Russian DPR suggesting additional language on a 
comprehensive peace agreement in the Middle East but said he 
would join consensus on the original draft language.  The 
Croatian Presidency then gaveled consensus on the oral 
remarks. 
 
¶3.  (U) The Security Council President read the following 
remarks at the press stakeout after the consultations: 
"The members of the Security Council welcomed Israel's 
evacuation of settlers from the compound in Hebron on 
December 4.  Council members condemned the resulting settler 
violence, including against Palestinian civilians and 
property.  Council members urge respect for the rule of law 
without discrimination or exception and welcomed the efforts 
of the Israeli and Palestinian security services to restore 
calm.  Council members encourage Israel and the Palestinian 
Authority to continue their security cooperation in the 
Hebron Governorate."
