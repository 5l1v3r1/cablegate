Poloff delivered reftel demarche points on December 24, 2008 
regarding the draft UNSC resolution to Vesna Vukovic, head of 
the MFA's UN office.  We have urged the MFA to share the 
points with the Croatian delegation in New York, but would 
suggest that USUN engage directly with the Croatians in New 
York for any necessary follow-up.
