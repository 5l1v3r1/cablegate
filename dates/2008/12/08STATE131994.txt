Begin text: 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
On December 14, Police in Moscow and St. Petersburg detained 
over 200 peaceful protestors at demonstrations, for which 
permission was not granted, led by opposition groups 
including Other Russia and the Union of Soviet Officers in 
Moscow. 
The difficulties faced by protest organizers, at the hands of 
authorities, in their attempts to receive permits as well as 
the harsh methods used to detain protestors raise serious 
concerns about the willingness of the Russian government to 
respect the exercise of freedoms of assembly and expression. 
 
Peaceful protests, marches, and demonstrations are a 
cornerstone to the development and functioning of a 
democratic society.  We continue to urge the Russian 
government to respect its OSCE commitments for freedom of 
assembly and expression. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
