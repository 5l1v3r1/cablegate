REF: A. NAIROBI 2681 
     ¶B. NAIROBI 2673 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Transitional Federal Government President 
Yusuf called Special Envoy Yates on December 1 to condemn the 
proposals from the November 26 Djibouti meetings (ref A) as 
"unworkable."  He also complained about Ethiopian troops' 
alleged recent actions at Villa Somalia and stated that 
Ethiopian withdrawal from Somalia without a replacement force 
to fill the vacuum would amount to handing Somalia to 
al-Shabaab. The Special Envoy noted that the November 26 
proposals represent a starting point, and encouraged Yusuf to 
engage in the process rather than exclude himself.  On the 
Villa Somalia complaint, Yusuf seemed to accept S/E Yates' 
assessment that lower-level officers had probably acted out 
of turn.  Regarding Ethiopian withdrawal, S/E Yates reminded 
Yusuf of ongoing efforts to establish a force to replace the 
Ethiopians, and once again encouraged Yusuf to constructively 
engage in the Djibouti process.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Parliament of 550 "Unreasonable and Unworkable" 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Transitional Federal Government President Abdullahi 
Yusuf called Special Envoy Yates on December 1 from Puntland, 
where Yusuf has been since the November 26 peace talks in 
Djibouti.  Yusuf condemned the Djibouti proposal of a 
550-member parliament as "unreasonable and unworkable," and 
an "international coup d'etat" opposed by every Somali "here 
in Puntland."  Yusuf said Somalia is a small country with no 
money to pay so many MPs, and claimed that expanding the 
parliament was unconstitutional.  He reiterated that he did 
not believe implementation of Djibouti proposals was possible. 
 
¶3. (SBU) S/E Yates replied that the Djibouti November 26 
document was simply a communique from the UN Secretary 
General's Special Representative (SRSG) spelling out 
proposals agreed to by the High Level Committee.  It 
established a working group to flesh out the proposals within 
thirty days.  S/E Yates noted that the number of MPs was 
indeed high and that the Transitional Federal Charter (TFC) 
would have to be amended before a unity government could be 
created and installed. 
 
¶4. (SBU) S/E Yates, mindful that Yusuf sees the latest 
Djibouti proposal as a move toward a Hawiye-only government, 
said that his conversations with the talks' participants, 
including with the Government of Djibouti, indicated a 
commitment to maintain the 4.5 formula for selection of new 
MPs.  He reminded Yusuf of Yusuf's own statements, to the USG 
and in public fora, of his support for the Djibouti process 
and encouraging the President's engagement, rather than 
estrangement from the process.  S/E Yates also pointed out 
that without continued progress on creating a unity 
government, and possible extension of the TFC as proposed, 
that the TFG mandate risked expiring in nine months with 
nothing accomplished. Finally, S/E Yates noted that during 
the latest Djibouti meetings the Prime Minister had tried to 
reach Yusuf in Nairobi to hear his views and seek his 
support, but that Yusuf had refused to take the calls. 
 
----------------------------- 
ENDF Entry into Villa Somalia 
----------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Yusuf also registered concern over the Ethiopian 
troops' alleged November 30 entry into Villa Somalia, 
confiscation of five vehicles mounted with heavy guns and 
detention of Presidential Guard (PG) officers.  Yusuf called 
the event a "hostile act" and a violation of international 
law. Yusuf wondered aloud about the USG's relationship with 
the GOE, but did not overtly imply USG complicity in the 
event.  S/E Yates informed Yusuf that the USG had no prior 
knowledge of the alleged Ethiopian behavior.  Further, S/E 
Yates noted that the Ethiopian actions had been reversed 
after a few hours with vehicles returned and the PG officer 
released.  He speculated that the quick reversal suggested 
that the confiscation had been the product of a decision by 
lower-level officers and not a directive from Addis.  Yusuf 
seemed to accept that explanation of the events.

Ethiopian Withdrawal 
-------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Finally, Yusuf asserted that if Ethiopia 
unilaterally withdraws as threatened by the end of January, 
Somalia will effectively be "delivered to al-Shabaab."  S/E 
Yates agreed that no one wanted an al-Shabaab takeover, and 
relayed to Yusuf some of the information from the recent 
Joint Security Committee meeting in Naivasha, Kenya (ref B), 
including the Committee's plans to stand up a joint TFG/ARS 
contingent, an idea of which Yusuf seemed not to have been 
aware.  S/E Yates once again urged Yusuf's cooperation in the 
political and security reforms that would contribute to 
success.

Comment

¶7. (SBU) Yusuf seemed grateful for the opportunity to discuss 
his concerns with S/E Yates, and seemed somewhat assuaged at 
the end of their conversation. Embassy is actively monitoring 
Yusuf's actions and is working directly and indirectly with 
Yusuf to minimize the any potential ability he may possess to 
disrupt the Djibouti process.
