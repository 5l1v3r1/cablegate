¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a Post-shipment verification to determine the 
legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, S.P.Korolev Rocket and 
Space Corp., Korolev, Russia. The company is listed on BIS license 
application D393609 as the ultimate consignee of one A128OXL-CQ172B 
electronic integrated circuit and micro assembly and associated 
field programmable gate array. These items are controlled for 
national security, anti-terrorism, missile technology and nuclear 
non proliferation reasons under ECCN 3A001. The licensee is Actel 
Corporation, 2061 Stierlin Court, Mountain View, CA. 
 
¶3. On December 17, 2008, Export Control Attach Peter Liston and LES 
Natalya Shipitsina conducted the requested post-shipment 
verification with S.P.Korolev Rocket and Space Corp., Korolev, 
Russia. The export control team met with Viktor Shebanov, Deputy 
Head Department and Alexander Veselov, Engineer. 
 
¶4. The S.P.Korolev Rocket and Space Corp., Korolev, Russia is an 
open Joint-Stock company with a President and Board of Directors. 
Established more than 50 years ago, S.P.Korolev Rocket and Space 
Corporation is also commonly referred to as the Special Design 
Bureau number 1 and/or Energia.  S.P.Korolev Rocket and Space 
Corporation became pioneers in rocket and space technology, 
intending to create new types of weaponry to assure parity with the 
United States.  The design of the R-7 rocket is symbol of pride for 
the S.P.Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation.  Originally developed 
as a vehicle for delivering a nuclear warhead to any point on the 
globe, it then became a starting point for a long line of launch 
vehicle modifications that are still being used for putting into 
space manned spacecraft and spacecraft for various applications. 
 
¶5. The commodity in reftel was originally received by the OAO 
Izhevskiy Radiozavod in Izhevsk, Russia, where they were tested and 
assembled into components for the Soyuz manned spacecraft and the 
Progress unmanned spacecraft.  Upon completion they were shipped to 
the S.P.Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation and placed onboard the 
individual flight vehicles. The ECO was therefore unable to inspect 
the reftel commodity. 
 
¶6. Viktor Shebanov, Deputy Head Department for the S.P.Korolev 
Rocket and Space Corporation stated that they receive between 20 and 
50 integrated circuit (I.C.) boards similar to the commodity in 
reftel from the United States each year.  They work jointly with 
NASA and the European Space program on joint projects and understand 
the End User requirements for receiving Dual Use commodities under 
license from the Department of Commerce. 
 
¶7. Recommendations: Post recommends S.P.Korolev Rocket and Space 
Corp., Korolev, Russia as a reliable recipient of sensitive U.S. 
origin commodities.
