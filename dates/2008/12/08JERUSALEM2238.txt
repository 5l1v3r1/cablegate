Main Stories: 
------------- 
Al Quds and Al Ayyam run front page photos of Hamas leader Haniyah 
addressing crowds at a Hamas' rally in Gaza on December 14, 
celebrating the group's 21st anniversary.  Citing news agencies, the 
papers quote Haniyyah rejecting the extension of Palestinian 
Authority President Abbas' term beyond January 9, 2009.  Haniyah 
states that his top priority is to break the Gaza "siege" through 
implementing a "boat intifada" of international solidarity boats and 
other "creative means."  He also states, according to Al Ayyam's 
front page, that President Bush has failed to topple Hamas rule in 
Gaza.  A second Hamas leader Al Zahhar is quoted on Al Hayat Al 
Jadida's front page asserting that Palestinian internal division 
will continue for a long time, and that Hamas is the sole legitimate 
actor in the Palestinian Territories.  Meanwhile, the papers front 
pages cite AFP in reporting that Abbas will soon call for 
presidential and legislative elections, according to Abbas' advisor 
Nabil Abu Rudaynah. 
 
The Hamas truce with Israel will not be renewed, according to Hamas 
leader Khalid Misha'al who is quoted on Al Quds' front page.  Citing 
news agencies, the reporting notes that Misha'al speaking from 
Damascus on December 14 stated that continued Israeli violations and 
the closure of Gaza crossing points preclude an extension.  The 
paper cites AFP in also reporting that Israeli Premier Olmert stated 
that Israel will renew the truce if Hamas stops rocket attacks on 
Israel.  In other Gaza news, Al Hayat Al Jadida's front page 
highlights that the Gaza Strip's only power plant ran out of fuel on 
December 14, plunging much of Gaza into darkness.  Hamas members 
noted that they expect a 50% reduction in the supply of electricity 
to the Strip and possible power grid breakdowns, if Israel does not 
reopen crossings to allow for the entry of fuel. 
Citing news agencies, Al Hayat Al Jadida leads with statements by 
Egypt's Foreign Minister Abu Al Ghayt telling journalists in Cairo 
on December 14 that Iran is seeking to expand its influence into the 
region by exploiting the Palestinian issue and manipulating a few 
Palestinians who have become, "like a toy in their [Iranians'] 
hands."  Al Ayyam's front page also runs Abu Al Ghayt's statements. 
 
All the papers run extensive front page photo and written coverage 
of the "attack" by a journalist on President Bush at a press 
conference in Baghdad during his farewell visit to Iraq on December 
Â¶14.  The papers note that President Bush listed U.S. achievements in 
Iraq despite the "many years of bloodshed" in Iraq.  Al Ayyam's 
front page adds, citing DPA and Israeli daily Haaretz, that 
president-elect Obama is expected to appoint Dennis Ross as his 
special envoy to the Middle East. 
Al Hayat Al Jadida's and Al Ayyam's front pages report that 
Secretary Rice called Palestinian Authority President Abbas on 
December 14 to discuss the U.N. Security Council's vote on a 
resolution concerning the Middle East peace process.  Quoting Sa'eb 
Erekat, chief PLO negotiator, Al Hayat Al Jadida reveals that Abbas 
told Rice that the Palestinians have comments on the draft 
resolution.  Al Ayyam's front page adds that Abbas reiterated his 
call for a halt to Israeli settlement activities.  The papers also 
report that the Quartet will meet in New York on December 14 to 
discuss the Security Council's engagement in the Middle East peace 
process, and that Secretary Rice will participate in that meeting. 
An Al Quds' front page headline accuses Israel of attempting to 
cover up its human rights violations against Palestinians:  Al Quds 
and Al Hayat Al Jadida run above the fold coverage of Israel's 
detention of U.N Human Rights Council special investigator for 
Israeli actions in the Palestinian Territories Richard Falk, who 
 
JERUSALEM 00002238  002.2 OF 003 
 
 
arrived at Tel Aviv airport on December 14 with a delegation from 
the Council.  The group was to report on the human rights situation 
in Israel, according to coverage. 
 
Al Quds' and Al Ayyam's inside pages report that Israeli Defense 
Forces (IDF) "stormed" Jenin city and surrounding villages, 
especially Zboba village, on December 14.  The IDF set up 
checkpoints and arrested a number of youth, taking them to a nearby 
IDF base.  The papers add that the IDF also stormed the villages of 
Yamun, Arraba, Fahma, Kufr Ray and Al Rama.  The papers continue 
that the IDF "alleged" that they were looking for wanted 
Palestinians. 
 
Al Hayat Al Jadida's inside page reports that Palestinian Authority 
(PA) Prime Minister advisor Hatim Abdul Qadir paid a "solidarity" 
visit to Bedouin areas near Ma'ale Adumim settlement in the E1 area 
near Jerusalem on December 14.  Qadir is quoted saying that Israeli 
evacuation orders that were issued to the Bedouins over the Eid Al 
Adha holiday, will be appealed by an Israeli lawyer in the Israeli 
courts.  The story continues weekend reporting on the alleged 
"Eastern Gate" plan for the E1 area.  According to the dailies, the 
5-year plan seeks to link the E1 block to the Jerusalem area Ma'ale 
Adumim settlement by adding 10,000 settlement units that will 
connect to the Jerusalem neighborhood of French Hill and include 
five hotels and a "huge" commercial mall. 
 
In more settlement news, Al Quds' front page quotes Ahmad Ruwaydy, 
head of the Jerusalem Department at the Palestinian Authority (PA) 
PQident's office stating that the PA will raise "to an 
international level" its opposition to Israeli settlement practices 
in Jerusalem, especially the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood.  Ruwaydy 
also revealed that there is a Palestinian committee preparing 
documents to file in settlement related Israeli court cases, adding 
that he remains unconvinced of the Israeli judiciary's 
impartiality.

WEEKEND STORIES 
---------------------------- 
Sunday, December 14 
The dailies noted that Palestinian leadership initiated a series of 
contacts on December 13 with several Arab capitals to coordinate 
positions on the anticipated U.N. Security Council resolution 
regarding the peace process.  In statements to Al Ayyam newspaper, 
Dr. Sa'eb Erekat also revealed that, "intensive consultations and 
contacts are being conducted currently between U.N. Security Council 
members and the Arab Committee... the Palestinian and Israeli 
parties." 
Al Quds' and Al Ayyam's front pages reported that Hamas confirmed on 
December 13 that it had not received any official invitation from 
Cairo to discuss the fate of the truce with Israel.  Hamas stressed 
that the decision to extend the truce will be based on national 
consensus.  Meanwhile, well-informed Israeli sources stated that a 
senior Israeli Defense Ministry official will travel to Cairo on 
December 14 to conduct talks with Egyptian intelligence service 
officials about the truce and the release of kidnapped Israeli 
soldier Shalit. 
 
Saturday, December 13 
"Chief Palestinian negotiator Quray reveals secrets about Israeli 
proposals," according to an Al Ayyam front page headline.  In a 
comprehensive interview about political developments, Ahmad Quray 
explained that the Palestinian people and their national cause are 
facing a critical, difficult, and dangerous turning point that 
 
JERUSALEM 00002238  003 OF 003 
 
 
requires official positions be clear and unified.  He added that 
internal division has continued for far too long and requires a more 
concerted effort to end before it becomes more entrenched.  Quray 
also revealed that the gap between Israel and the Palestinians is 
still wide on the issues of Jerusalem and refugees, noting that the 
team had refused an Israeli proposal to annex 6.8% of Palestinian 
land where Israeli settlements are located and an Israeli "promise" 
to return 5,000 refugees to Israel. 
 
Al Quds' and Al Ayyam's front pages reported that scores of 
"anti-wall protesters" were wounded in Ni'lin, Bil'in, and Al 
Ma'sara during the weekly protest.  The papers noted that 
Palestinians were joined by foreign and Israeli peace activists to 
commemorate the 60th anniversary of the universal declaration of 
human rights.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
--------------------- 
1)  Al Quds' editorial is titled, "The required international role" 
(12/15):  [Regarding the upcoming Security Council meeting] what we 
expect of today's Security Council, considering its 
responsibilities, is that it not be satisfied by issuing a 
non-binding statement, resolution or document to support the peace 
process... what the Council must do is adopt a clear mechanism that 
binds Israel to abide by international standards and end its 
illegitimate occupation of Arab and Palestinian Territories." 
 
2) Samih Shabib opines in Al Ayyam under the title, "Waiting for the 
outcome of the Security Council meeting" (12/15): "Informed sources 
fear that the statement by the Security Council will set a new 
international precedent, that... bypasses legitimate international 
agreements... especially [U.N.] resolutions 242 and 338, and thus 
adopts a new basis for a continued Israeli-Palestinian peace process 
that has shown no tangible results so far... international 
efforts... would focus on sponsoring negotiations and averting their 
collapse... fearing the return of a spirit of resistance to the West 
Bank and Gaza - a natural, automatic reaction to negotiations that 
have lasted for so long without bearing any fruit."
