SUBJECT: FOUR EGYPTIAN COMPANIES LOSE QIZ ELIGIBILITY 
 
REF: 08 CAIRO 2410 
 
¶1. (U) The Government of Egypt has publicly announced that 
four Egyptian companies have had their eligibility to export 
under the Qualifying Industrial Zone (QIZ) protocol 
suspended. The companies suspended are The Misr Company for 
Industrial and Textile Investments, The International Textile 
House of Egypt, The Egyptian Company for Dyeing and Trading 
(Azghaltex), and El Nenaiae Company for Industries and 
Trading.  Each of these companies was suspended from QIZ 
program eligibility for three months as a result of 
non-compliance with the QIZ protocol.  The first three did 
not meet the 10.5% Israeli content requirement and the last 
did not submit QIZ documentation. 
 
¶2. (U) The QIZ Joint Committee agreed to these suspensions 
during its quarterly meeting held in Cairo last month 
(reftel).  Each company is excluded from QIZ eligibility from 
November 23, 2008 to February 14, 2009. Further violations 
would carry penalties of 6 and 12 month suspensions. The 
three companies that had supplied documentation exported just 
under $112,000 to the U.S. under the QIZ program in the 
second quarter, a negligible amount of the $206 million in 
total QIZ exports to the U.S. during that period. 
 
¶3. (U) The GOE released notice of the suspensions to the 
press as well as via updates to the Egyptian QIZ website 
(www.qizegypt.gov.eg/Data QualifiedCompanies.aspx).
