SUBJECT: INDONESIAN HIGH SEAS DRIFTNET ACTIVITY INFORMATION 
 
REF: STATE 100495 
 
¶1.  This message responds to reftel request for information from 
Indonesia for purposes of the High Seas Driftnet Fishing Moratorium 
Protection Act. 
 
¶2.  Summary.  The Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) 
has provided specific information on the vessels listed on the 
Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) IUU vessel list. 
The Government of Indonesia (GOI) has a strong interest in improving 
its capacity for monitoring, control and enforcement, MMAF officials 
say, as it becomes a member of various regional fisheries management 
organizations.  They insist that Indonesia is committed to doing its 
best, and welcome any USG assistance and cooperation in this area. 
End Summary. 
 
MMAF: Monitoring and Control Challenging 
---------------------------------------- 
¶3.  Post discussed reftel questions on November 24 with Ministry of 
Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) officials from the Directorate 
General of Capture Fisheries (Capture Fisheries) and the Directorate 
General of Surveillance and Control of Marine Resources and 
Fisheries (Surveillance and Control).  Capture Fisheries' Director 
of Fisheries Resource Management, Nilanto Perbowo, stated that the 
GOI does have in place control mechanisms, including a vessel 
monitoring system, to verify that Indonesian-flagged vessels operate 
in accordance with regional conservation and management measures. 
He noted that the MMAF has issued ministerial decrees and a number 
of regulations to ensure effective monitoring and control.  However, 
Perbowo and other MMAF officials admitted challenges in effectively 
implementing these; the MMAF has inadequate numbers of inspectors 
and field staff to effectively monitor and control a fishing fleet 
spread across the vast Indonesian archipelago and EEZ. 
 
Action against Vessels on IATTC IUU Vessel List 
--------------------------------------------- - 
¶4.  Perbowo noted that Capture Fisheries has sent several official 
letters (the most recent in May 2008) to the IATTC Director since 
2006 regarding the 12 vessels listed.  (Note: Post will send scanned 
copies of these letters to USG POCs by email.  End Note).  Those 
letters noted that the MMAF had searched its licensing database for 
the listed vessels and held several meetings with the vessels' 
owners. 
 
¶5.  The MMAF officials stated that Capture Fisheries sent a 
reprimand letter to the owners of the listed fishing vessels, 
demanding an explanation, on September 25, 2006.  Responses from 
owners in April and September 2007 acknowledged their wrongdoing, 
but pled ignorance of rules on high seas fishing.  Representatives 
of the government and the Indonesian Tuna Association held a 
consultation meeting in Jakarta on September 24, 2007 to clarify the 
issues. 
 
¶6.  The MMAF confirmed that 7 of the 12 fishing vessels are still 
operating and registered in their national licensing database. 
However, the remaining 5 vessels are no longer active and been 
delisted from the database, for various reasons.  The MMAF issued a 
letter on October 10, 2007 to the remaining vessel owners warning 
them that their licenses would be revoked immediately if they 
operate in the IATTC area again. 
 
GOI Procedures 
-------------- 
¶7.  The MMAF/Capture Fisheries is responsible for issuing fishing 
licenses, while the Ministry of Transportation is responsible for 
registering and issuing ship licenses.  Indonesia issues fishing 
licenses valid only for its EEZ.  By default, Indonesia does not 
permit fishing on the high seas.  However, there is currently no law 
or regulation on high seas fishing, and therefore no proper legal 
basis on which to punish Indonesian vessels found fishing illegally 
on the high seas.  According to the MMAF officials, they are 
currently preparing a ministerial decree on high seas fishing and 
licensing which it hopes to have ready by the end of 2009, and which 
 
JAKARTA 00002205  002 OF 002 
 
 
will provide the legal basis for punitive action against violators. 
 
¶8.  The normal MMAF procedure for disciplining Indonesian fishing 
vessels for violations in Indonesian waters: 
-- MMAF first warns vessel owner/company three times; 
-- MMAF then freezes license for two weeks, during which time the 
owner has to provide a satisfactory response; 
-- If no satisfactory response, the MMAF will revoke the fishing 
license. 
 
USG Assistance and Cooperation Welcome 
-------------------------------------- 
¶9.  The MMAF officials welcomed potential USG assistance and 
cooperation to help Indonesia control its fishing fleet and meet its 
international obligations.  They pointed to successful cooperation 
with Australia in monitoring activity in the Timor and Arafura seas. 
 Indonesia has a strong interest in improving its capacity for 
monitoring, control and enforcement, they said, especially following 
its admission to membership in the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission 
(IOTC) in 2007, and anticipating membership in the Western and 
Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) in the near future.  It 
will not be an easy process, they said, but insisted that Indonesia 
is committed to doing its best.
