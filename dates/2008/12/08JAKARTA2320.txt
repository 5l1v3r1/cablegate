Jakarta, December 23, 2008 
 
Honorable Speaker Nancy Pelosi 
The U.S. House of Representatives 
235 Cannon HOB 
Washington, DC  20515 
United States of America 
 
Dear Honorable Pelosi, 
 
On behalf of the Parliamentary Reform Committee that visited 
Washington during the first week of December, I express my 
thanks for the cooperation provided by your Congress.  The 
year 2009 is historic for the world's second largest 
democracy, with the inauguration of President Elect Barack 
Obama and Vice President Elect Joe Biden. 
 
Inauguration of Mr. Obama is of significance to the people of 
Indonesia who have an affectionate feeling for Mr. Obama as 
he lived in his early age in Jakarta.  It is also a 
historical year for the world's third largest democracy, the 
Republic of Indonesia, with our national legislative election 
beginning in April 2009. 
 
I would welcome a visit by your House Democratic Assistance 
Commission (HDAC) early in 2009.  You have instituted many 
reforms in the U.S. House.  Under my tenure as Speaker, The 
Indonesian House of Representatives has introduced reforms, 
especially relating to developing of a more viable 
Parliament.  However there are more Parliamentary reforms I 
intend to accomplish during this term. 
 
Meanwhile, I am happy to inform you that we have recently 
officiated the Global Legal Information Network (GLIN) 
Indonesia Office which will be in on line communication with 
the US Congress/Law Library of Congress GLIN Office, to allow 
our parliamentarians of both sides access into legislative 
material resources available in our two parliaments for 
comparative purposes. 
 
A visit by Members of the U.S. Congress would give our 
respective Members an opportunity to exchange reform 
experiences and also discuss ways of how we can work together 
during this economic crisis that impacts Indonesians and 
 
JAKARTA 00002320  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
Americans.  To further strengthening this cooperation, we 
also view it as timely for the two parliaments to form an 
ad-hoc joint working group. 
 
In the current Parliamentary session we passed legislation 
relating to mining and the Capetown-Agreement Aviation which 
are important to the Indonesian and US economies. 
 
In conclusion, allow me to renew our invitation to you to 
visit Indonesia soonest at the most convenient time. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
/S/ 
 
HR Agung Laksono 
Speaker of the Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat 
of the Republic of Indonesia
