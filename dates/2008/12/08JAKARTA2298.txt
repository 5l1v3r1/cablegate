REF: JAKARTA 2195 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1.  (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- Please 
handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  The U.S. Library of Congress (LOC) and 
the Indonesian Parliament (DPR) on December 16 jointly 
launched a U.S.-provided web-based information center for use 
by legislators and staff.  It is called the Global Legal 
Information Network (GLIN).  Among other benefits, GLIN will 
provide Indonesians involved in legislative drafting an 
unprecedented mechanism for comparative legal research.  This 
initiative aims to strengthen Indonesian 
institutions--especially its legislative branch--in this, the 
world's third-largest democracy.  END SUMMARY. 
 
LAUNCHING AN INFORMATION NETWORK 
 
¶3.  (U) Mission hosted a visiting team from the Library of 
Congress of three GLIN experts headed by Dr. Janice Hyde this 
week.  The purpose of the visit was to launch a web-based 
information center in Indonesia, the Global Legal Information 
Network (GLIN).  During the team's visit, it met with 
officials from the DPR, the Constitutional and Supreme 
Courts, and other Indonesians in order to introduce and 
explain the benefits of GLIN. 
 
¶4.  (U) During the trip, Speaker Agung Laksono met with the 
GLIN team on December 16.  DCM and LOC (Indonesia) 
representative also participated in the meeting.  Senior DPR 
members Theo Sambuaga and Marzuki Daruzman joined as Speaker 
Laksono and Dr. Hyde officially launched the web-based 
center.  Members of the DPR's Secretariat-General and the 
heads of all eleven DPR Commissions and five legislative 
boards were present at the ceremony. 
 
IMPORTANT TOOL FOR LEGAL/LEGISLATIVE RESEARCH 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The GLIN initiative is an important one in building 
the capabilities of Indonesia's legislature.  GLIN 
(http://www.glin.gov) provides a standardized way for the 35 
participating countries to use web-based technology to 
distribute verified legal documents to local populations and 
the international community.  This increases transparency and 
supports democratic institutions by allowing the public 
access to the laws that rule them. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) GLIN also gives Indonesia an international context 
for its legislation.  This could stimulate more open-minded 
thinking on controversial issues such as possible 
protectionist legislation and on controversial social 
measures.  Through GLIN, individual Indonesian lawmakers can 
ask other participants legal questions and do comparative 
legal research. 
 
BUILDING CAPACITY, STRENGTHENING DEMOCRACY 
 
¶7.  (SBU) The establishment of the GLIN center has positive 
implications for the continued growth of democratic and 
institutional reform in Indonesia.  In his remarks at the 
December 16 event, Speaker Laksono thanked GLIN and the House 
Democracy Assistance Commission (HDAC) for their active roles 
in parliamentary capacity-building and helping strengthen 
democracy in Indonesia (reftel).  There is little doubt that 
Indonesia's legislative branch needs assistance; it is a new 
body in this new democracy and lacks capabilities and 
expertise.  GLIN will help add to its capacity by connecting 
it to a superhighway of information on legislation and on 
law-making.
