1st VP/FM Expresses Concern to Ambassador, Seeks Assistance 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
¶1.  (S//NF)  First VP and FM Samuel Lewis expressed his 
concern over recent events in the Darien and requested U.S. 
assistance addressing the FARC threat in this border region 
that abuts Colombia, during a one-on-one meeting at his 
private office on December 12. The December 11 firefight 
between members of Panama's National Frontier Service 
(SENAFRONT) and armed irregulars, apparently belonging to the 
FARC, in the village of Menene near the Colombian border in 
the Darien served as the impetus for this meeting.  One man 
was wounded and captured by the SENAFRONT officers in this 
clash and is currently in Panama City undergoing medical 
treatment and in police custody. Lewis noted the concern 
among indigenous leaders in the area, following unconfirmed 
reports of FARC activity in the Embera-Wounaan Sambu Comarca. 
(Note: Embera Grand Cacique Betanio Chiquidama asserted to 
POLOFF on December 12 that "armed irregulars" had forced the 
residents of two villages to flee on December 12. The precise 
nature of events to which the Grand Cacique as referring 
remain unclear. End Note).  Lewis asked the Ambassador for 
night vision goggles (NVG) and USG support for a GOP request 
to the Government of Colombia (GOC) for helicopters. 
Ambassador urged the GOP to permit two-three members of the 
U.S. Navy SEAL Counter Narco-Terrorism training team that is 
presently in-country training SENAFRONT to deploy to 
SENAFRONT's Headquarters in Meteti, Darien, to help plan and 
direct SENAFRONT operations.

Panama Seeks to Lease Colombian Helicopters 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (S//NF)  According to Lewis, the GOP intends to ask the 
GOC to lease it two-three Bell 212 helicopters, noting that 
Panama had recently trained a group of pilots from the 
National Aero-Naval Service (SENAN) to fly these aircraft. He 
noted that the difficulty SENAFRONT had in getting 
reinforcements to Menene, following reports that local 
teachers had been taken captive by and forced to cook for 
armed irregulars.  Lewis noted that this situation had made 
it clear to the GOP that they needed to provide SENAFRONT 
with airlift capability immediately and could not wait for 
the delivery of the five UH-1 "Huey" helicopters presently 
being refurbished.  Lewis asked that the USG weigh in with 
the GOC in favor of this request. Anticipating that the GOC 
might object on the grounds that such a lease would leave a 
helicopter deficit for Colombian forces, Lewis requested that 
the USG consider supplying Colombia with more helicopters to 
"backfill" behind this request. Lewis noted that Panama could 
not request the helicopters directly from the U.S. because 
Panama would not allow U.S. pilots to fly in the Darien, for 
fear of U.S. casualties, and the U.S. would not allow 
Panamanian pilots to fly U.S. helicopters. 
 
----------------- 
Panama Seeks NVGs 
----------------- 
 
¶3.  (S//NF)  Lewis also asked for immediate delivery of night 
vision goggles (NVGs) to allow SENAFRONT to operate more 
effectively at night. Post's Office of Defense Cooperation 
(ODC) sent a representative to SOUTHCOM who picked up 20 NVGs 
that had been previously acquired for SENAFRONT and other 
Panamanian security forces.  When Ambassador reported that 
ODC anticipated bringing NVGs to Panama on December 15, 
Lewis said he was extremely pleased with the Embassy's and 
SOUTHCOM's rapid response. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Ambassador Urges GOP to Accept SEAL Support 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (S//NF)  Ambassador reminded Lewis that ten-member U.S. 
Navy SEAL Counter-Narco/Terrorism (CNT) training team was 
presently in Panama (but not the Darien) training SENAFRONT. 
 
She urged the GOP to permit two-three SEALs to deploy to the 
SENAFRONT Headquarters in Meteti, Darien to help plan and 
direct SENAFRONT missions in the Darien.  (Note:  ODC has 
been in touch with SOUTHCOM and SOCSOUTH to coordinate this 
prospective change to the CNT's mission as well as a the 
deployment of two-three SEALs to Meteti.)  Lewis, wary of the 
offer, responded that President Torrijos did not want U.S. 
military personnel in harm's way or directly involved in the 
fighting. Ambassador underscored that these SEALs would 
deploy solely in an advisory capacity well away from the 
front lines, that this team would help SENAFRONT plan 
successful operations, and that these experts would also help 
avoid any situation that might lead to a tactical defeat for 
SENAFRONT. Ambassador stressed that this small team was well 
known to and had been working with SENAFRONT already. Lewis 
agreed to present the offer to President Torrijos and report 
back upon his return from Brazil on December 18.

Comment 
------- 
 
¶5.  (S//NF)  The extent of and reasons behind the up-tick in 
FARC activity in the Darien are unclear. When the story that 
the Menene incident might be part of a larger incursion broke 
in the media on December 14, the only official available to 
be quoted by the Panamanian media was Colombian Defense 
Minister Jose Manuel Santos, who claimed that the incidents 
were part of a broad based retreat into Panama by scattered 
and hungry elements of the 57th and 58th Fronts.  The 
situation on the ground remains confused, but the GOP seems 
to have reluctantly come to the conclusion that it must take 
action to assure the country that the situation is under 
control. Post will continue to push the GOP to develope a 
comprehensive strategy for dealing with the Darien, which 
takes into account the legal framework in which SENAFRONT is 
operating. We will hold off on offering any further material 
assistance until we see signs of such a strategy, which would 
allow the GOP to full take advantage of the assistance.
