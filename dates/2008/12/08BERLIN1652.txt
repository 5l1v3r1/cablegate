REF: STATE 127070 
 
¶1.  (SBU) EconOff delivered reftel demarche to the German 
Ministries of Finance, Economics, and Foreign Affairs 
regarding the U.S. designation of the Saudi Arabia-based 
Union of Good organization as a supporter of terror and 
encouraged the ministries to pursue similar measures.  None 
of our German interlocutors were aware of any information 
linking the Union of Good and Hamas, but they said that 
Germany works exclusively within the EU on all issues related 
to the designation of entities as supporters of terror. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Economics Ministry Office Director Martin Lutz 
explained that the only exception to Germany working outside 
of the EU on such designations was if there was the clear and 
present danger of a pending terrorist act.  In this case, 
Lutz said that Germany could put emergency measures in place 
to designate terror sponsors, but could only do it 
temporarily - allowing for immediate action, while giving the 
entire EU time to make the designation.  Finance Ministry 
Desk Officer Kristina Wogatzki and Lutz both said that they 
would welcome further information from the USG regarding the 
Union of Good and the connection with Hamas.
