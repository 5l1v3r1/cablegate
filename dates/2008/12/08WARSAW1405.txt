SUBJECT: CUBA - LIBERTAD ACT RESPONSE FROM POLAND 
 
REF: SECSTATE 126578 
 
 ¶1.  (U)  Post provides the following in response to ref A 
questions. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Promotion of democracy and human rights in Cuba: 
Poland has an excellent track record with respect to 
supporting freedom and democracy in Cuba, and believes that 
its experience in the Solidarity trade movement and its own 
transition from communism to a vibrant democracy give it 
particular expertise to share with the Castro regime's 
opponents. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Public Statements:  Daniel Gromann, Counselor in 
the MFA's Americas Division (and until August 2007 Poland's 
Charge d'Affaires in Havana) told EconOff that during the 
last six months, Poland continued to support Cuban dissidents 
in internal EU discussions, and also continued its outreach 
through its embassy to Cuban civil society and dissidents. 
On May 30, a "Free Cuba" caucus was formed in the Polish 
parliament.  The caucus has seven members from the Sejm (the 
lower house) and two members from the Senate.  These include 
a number of political heavy hitters. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  High-level diplomatic visits: Gromann said that 
there have been no high-level diplomatic visits between 
Poland and Cuba in the last six months. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  Humanitarian assistance in the wake of Hurricanes 
Gustav and Ike: Gromann said that in a diplomatic note Poland 
offered EUR 70,000 in official government humanitarian 
assistance.  Cuba rejected the offer in discussions at the 
Ambassadorial level, although it never sent a return 
diplomatic note.  The Cubans stressed the rejection was in 
accordance with their then-policy of accepting EU aid only 
from Spain and Belgium, and was not intended as a "hostile 
gesture." 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  Investment:  Gromann stated he was unaware of any 
investment by Polish firms in Cuba.  There was no Polish 
representation at the Havana Trade Fair on November 3. 
 
¶7.  (U)  Trade Agreements:  At present there are no 
legally-binding trade agreements between Poland and Cuba. 
 
¶8.  (SBU)  Exchange Programs:  There are no known exchange 
programs between Poland and Cuba, and certainly no 
Cuban-government sponsored doctors working in Poland.  It is 
possible that a few Cubans are students 
in Polish universities.
