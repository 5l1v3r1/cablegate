SUBJECT: Somalia - Two Recent Media Outlet Closures 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Islamists allegedly forced the closure of two radio 
stations in Somalia in mid-December, both reportedly for playing 
music of which they did not approve.  Radio Markabley was closed 
from December 10 for two days.  HornAfrik's Kismayo office was 
closed on December 13 and remains closed as of December 30, although 
one contact speculates that the closure may be the result of an 
internal dispute rather than al-Shabaab's desire to silence the 
station.  Both stations have expressed surprise and disappointment 
at the closures and we continue to monitor both situations.  End 
summary.

Radio Markabley Closed 
Over "Love Songs" 
----------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ahmed Omar Salihi, Director of Markabley Radio and a post 
contact, told us that on December 10, the "Islamic Courts" who 
control Bardera town ordered Radio Markabley closed for releasing "a 
lot of love songs and music which is foreign to the Islamic 
religion."  Salihi reported that the chief security officer and two 
other officers entered the radio director's office and ordered the 
director to cease all activities of the Radio.  Ahmed A. Farah Ato, 
an owner of the radio who was present at the time, attempted to 
defuse the situation by explaining the station's goals of helping 
the community.  Salihi tells us that Ato argued that the station's 
programs are beneficial to the community, with 90% of the programs 
aimed at subjects like peace and reconciliation, HIV/AIDS, women's 
issues, security, and health.  Salihi reported that the station was 
closed for two days, but reopened after determined negotiations and 
pressure from the Bardera community, who depend on Radio Markabley 
as a link to the world beyond the town's borders.

HornAfrik Closure: 
Forced or Staged? 
------------------ 
 
¶3. (SBU) On December 13, HornAfrik's Kismayo office was closed and 
the station remains off-air as of December 30, according to 
HornAfrik Managing Partner Lul Sharmarke.  Sharmarke told us that 
the station's Kismayo office was closed "by Al Shabaab," who claimed 
that no radio station should "air any kind of music."  Sharmarke 
reported that no one was arrested or otherwise harassed, but that 
the station has not been allowed to re-open.  She said the 
management of the Kismayo office continues to negotiate with 
al-Shabaab. 
 
¶4. (SBU) We asked some of our contacts why the HornAfrik closure did 
not result in the usual outcry from media-related NGO's who monitor 
freedom of the press in Somalia. One contact said that he has heard 
this closure may be the result of a dispute between Lul Sharmarke 
and other stakeholders, rather than a hostile al-Shabaab action. 
(Note: We are monitoring HornAfrik's management, as this is not the 
first report we have had regarding a possible internal conflict.) 
NGOs are reserving comment until such time as they can confirm the 
circumstances of this closure.

Post Actions

¶5. (SBU) As is our practice in cases like these, we immediately 
reached out to the stations involved, both of which are contacts of 
the Somalia Unit.  We have also contacted the TFG's Minister of 
Information to inquire about the facts of the incidents and to 
register our concern.  The Minister, who also serves as Deputy Prime 
Minister and who has recently had very little time to dedicate to 
the Information Minister portfolio, has not replied to date.  (Note: 
The Minister in question, Ahmed Abdisalam Aden, is one of the three 
founders of HornAfrik but claims to have given up his share of the 
station when he assumed his role in the TFG.)
