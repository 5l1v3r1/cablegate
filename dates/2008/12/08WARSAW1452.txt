(SBU) In response to reftel demarche, which we delivered with 
our Dutch and Russian counterparts, Szymon Bochenski of the 
Polish MFA's Security Policy Department indicated that he 
would attempt to identify an appropriate official to 
participate in the Global Initiative Plenary Meeting on June 
16-17, 2009.  Bochenski warned, however, that May-June will 
be an extremely busy period for his ministry, which is 
organizing the European Operational Experts Group Meeting of 
the Proliferation Security Initiative in June.
