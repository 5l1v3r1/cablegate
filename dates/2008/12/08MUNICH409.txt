SUBJECT:  EU/GALILEO/GPS: POLITICAL CAVEATS FOR AMERICAN 
CONTRACTORS 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  PLEASE PROTECT ACCORDINGLY. 
 
¶1.  (U) SUMMARY:  American subcontractors could be well-placed to 
partner with primary EU contractors as the EU presses on with its 
aggressive schedule to attain an operational 30-satellite Galileo 
constellation by 2013.  Successful bidders will have to keep in mind 
that Galileo projects have technical and especially political 
components that could shift up to the final bidding moment in summer 
¶2009.  EU political considerations will present special challenges, 
not only because there will be pressure to keep design honors at 
home but also because there will be a push to protect EU jobs from 
going to the Americans in these financially uncertain times.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On December 16, Munich Consulate PolOff and Economic 
Specialist met with officials from EADS Astrium Germany (Munich) to 
discuss the company's role in the Galileo project, Astrium's 
prospects in the bidding process, and where American firms could fit 
in.  Astrium officials highlighted how their proposal to build 26 of 
the 30 satellites, valued at 3.4 billion euro and the Galileo 
contractual crown jewel, will be superior to their only competitor, 
OHB Technologies of Bremen.  They stated their desire to partner 
with U.S. contractors to strengthen the technical aspects of their 
proposal. 
 
GALILEO CONTRACTS TAKING SHAPE AGAINST AGGRESSIVE SCHEDULE 
 
¶3.  (U) The EU has stipulated that all Galileo primary contractors 
be of EU origin, stemming from a decision to limit bidders to EU 
member states because Galileo is a matter of EU security.  However, 
this does not legally preclude EU primary contractors from 
partnering with U.S. firms on a sub-contractual basis. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Astrium officials explained that the European Space Agency 
(ESA) is currently reviewing preliminary offers from primary bidders 
and in March 2009 bidders will specify their supply chain, which is 
where U.S. sub-contractors (if any) will be officially named.  After 
a series of "dialogues and refinements," our contacts explained that 
the ESA plan is to award final contracts by June 2009 with 
construction to begin immediately thereafter.  (COMMENT: This last 
statement was delivered with laughter as our Astrium contacts 
admitted that this construction plan is very ambitious.  END 
COMMENT) 
 
ASTRIUM CITES MANUFACTURING ABILITY AND EXPERIENCE AS EDGE 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Astrium, bidding against OHB Technologies to build 26 of 
the 30 Galileo satellites, believes that their experience 
constructing the first four Galileo satellites coupled with their 
superior manufacturing capacity will ultimately lead to their 
landing the contract.  Astrium officials said that the EU's current 
plan to manufacture 26 satellites in three years would demand 
sophisticated high-volume manufacturing capabilities and precise 
control of supply chains.  Astrium officials argued that OHB 
Technologies was the much smaller bidder and that it is unclear 
whether or not they have the production know-how or capacity to 
fulfill the contract. 
 
U.S. INVOLVEMENT IN GALILEO CONTRACTS A DICEY SITUATION 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  On the technical side, Astrium's representatives pointed 
out that American contractors could have an advantage up front if 
they had appropriate components on the shelf or have components that 
they could modify easily for Galileo.  They pointed out, however, 
that the American GPS system is a more robust, hardened design 
compared to the smaller, more streamlined Astrium design for 
Galileo.  Because of this, they thought American contractors might 
be challenged to adapt their larger or heavier products to fit on 
the smaller Galileo platform. 
 
¶7. (SBU) More importantly, on the political side, Astrium officials 
made it clear that their bidding war with OHB would likely lead to 
EU political interference regarding the presence of U.S. 
subcontractors and the amplitude of the U.S. role.  Additionally, 
Astrium officials noted EU aspirations to distribute adequately an 
appropriate piece of the Galileo pie to each of the major EU Galileo 
contributor nations.  This could crowd contract distributions, 
reducing the political attractiveness of non-EU subcontractors. 
However, Astrium said that although the political gamesmanship in 
awarding supply contracts would "create challenges" for American 
suppliers, it would "not cut them out" by any means. In addition to 
from the United States, Astrium expected to see contractor bids from 
companies in France, Germany, Great Britain, and Italy, and maybe

aspirants from other EU countries. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶8.  (SBU) The confidence that Astrium conveyed in securing the 
contract to build 26 Galileo satellites may be a little premature 
considering that OHB beat Astrium on the bid to build the SAR-Lupe 
(space radar imaging system) constellation for the German Ministry 
of Defense.  Further, Astrium cannot count on the German Government 
to lobby for them since both bidders are German already.  In 
addition, OHB has quietly strengthened its own position by 
purchasing in April 2008 UK based Surrey Satellites Technology 
Limited (SSTL) - builder of the first Galileo In-Orbit Element 
(GIOVE-A).  Given that Galileo is now EU tax-payer funded, the 
presence of potential significant participation of U.S. 
sub-contractors may raise political sensitivities of EU pride and 
job loss, and that in very financially uncertain times.
