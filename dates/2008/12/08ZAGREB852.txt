SUBJECT: SOMALI PIRACY: CROATIA STILL REVIEWING PROPOSED 
RESOLUTION 
 
REF: SECSTATE 130496 
 
(SBU) On December 12, Poloff presented reftel demarche 
regarding the draft UNSC resolution on Somali piracy to Vesna 
Vukovic, head of the MFA's UN office.  Vukovic said that 
Croatia supported the new resolution to combat the rise of 
piracy off the coast of Somalia, and they were still 
reviewing the provisions regarding the use of force against 
pirates on land.  She took note of our position and said that 
she would forward the U.S. views regarding the need for a 
robust resolution to her colleagues in New York for 
consideration.  She also indicated that Croatia is 
considering participating in the EU's European Security and 
Defense Policy counter-piracy operation.  (NOTE: We believe 
this means by contributing one or two personnel to the 
mission.  END NOTE.)
