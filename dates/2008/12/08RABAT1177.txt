¶1.  (SBU) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office of Treaties 
and Legal Affairs sent to the U.S. Embassy December 19 final 
draft copies of the English, French, and Arabic translations 
of the Agreement Between The Government Of The United States 
Of America And The Government Of The Kingdom Of Morocco 
Regarding The Development And Operation Of A Seismic 
Monitoring Station In The Kingdom Of Morocco.  We understand 
that they agreed to the text in English as agreed in August 
¶2007.  Copies of all versions were forwarded to Morocco Desk 
via e-mail for conformity. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) MFA Legal Division Head Karim Ben Sallam told us 
December 18 that the GOM made sufficient progress on its 
internal implementation arrangements to proceed with signing. 
 He noted that the MFA made some linguistic changes in the 
Arabic version.  They also changed the word "resiliation" in 
article 13 to "denonciation" in the French version. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) As soon as these documents can be conformed in 
Washington, we will contact the MFA to set a date for the 
final signature.  Embassy proposes Ambassador Thomas Riley 
sign on behalf of the United States.  It is still unknown who 
will sign on behalf of the Moroccans.
