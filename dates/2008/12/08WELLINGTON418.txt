Â¶1.  (SBU) In response to reftel action request, on December 3 
Poloff shared talking points with Jillian Dempster, deputy 
director of the International Security and Disarmament 
Division of the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
Trade (MFAT).  Dempster contacted Poloff on December 15 and 
stated that she was unable to provide the GNZ's position and 
explained that, with the recent appointment of a new Minister 
of Foreign Affairs (Murray McCully), consideration of such 
sensitive policy matters is in transition.  However, she 
added that the proposed amendments to the NSG Nuclear 
Guidelines seemed to be a step in the right direction.
