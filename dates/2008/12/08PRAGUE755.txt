¶1. (SBU) Summary: Emboff spoke with Magdalena Janesova of the 
Czech MFA Department of Common Foreign and Security Policy 
prior to the December 8-9 EU General Affairs and External 
Relations Council (GAERC).  Of note were her comments on: the 
Middle East, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Pakistan. 
End Summary. 
 
---------- 
Middle East 
---------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Janesova noted that at this moment in time the EU is 
in a bit of a "waiting mode" with respect to the Middle East, 
particularly since there are upcoming elections in Israel, 
which are expected to set the tone for Israeli engagement in 
the future.  Janesova, who accompanied FM Schwarzenberg on 
his visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories on 
November 30 and December 1, commented that while the Czechs 
are still interested in upgrading EU-Israeli relations during 
their EU Presidency, quite a lot of work remains, both within 
the EU and with Israel, as well as the Palestinians.  She 
also stated that while the Palestinians were consulted about 
a possible EU-Israel Summit in May or June of 2009, and that 
they initially expressed understanding for an upgrade in 
relations as well as interest in something perhaps being done 
for the Palestinians, this has now changed and the 
Palestinians are expressing opposition to the idea.  Janesova 
also commented that the Middle East remains on the agenda of 
just about every EU foreign policy related meeting, however, 
until the political situation in Israel becomes clearer, the 
EU remains focused on expressing support for the Annapolis 
process and encouraging dialogue. 
 
---------- 
Democratic Republic of Congo 
---------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) The EU plans to announce an additional 45.6M euros 
in additional humanitarian assistance for the DRC, according 
to Janesova.  She also noted that the idea of a 
multi-national force for the DRC has been widely discussed, 
however, the EU does not plan to put together such a force as 
many EU members opposed the idea.  Some of the concerns 
focused on the fact that EU battlegroups were not designed 
for such a situation, nor to complement other forces.  As 
well, some EU member states thought more needed to be done to 
address conflicts in the EU's backyard and that this proposed 
mission for the DRC did not fit well with the EU's priorities 
and limited resources. 
 
---------- 
Pakistan 
---------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Czech MFA Departments for CFSP and the Asia and 
Pacific Region have appreciated our details related to the 
Friends of Democratic Pakistan and the proposed donor 
conference to support the IMF stand-by arrangement reached 
with Pakistan.  They share our concerns related to Pakistan 
future path and the need to encourage Pakistan in its efforts 
to fight terrorism.  According to Janesova, Czech FM 
Schwarzenberg would like to enhance the EU's dialogue and 
engagement with Pakistan and he has proposed to his EU 
colleagues, arranging an EU-Pakistan troika meeting in 
Islamabad in February, perhaps in conjunction with the EU's 
participation at a Friends of Pakistan meeting around the 
same time.  The Czechs have promised to keep us apprised of 
any developments in this area.
