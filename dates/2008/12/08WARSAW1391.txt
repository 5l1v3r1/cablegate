(SBU) Szymon Bochenski, responsible for nuclear proliferation 
issues at the MFA's Security Policy Department, told us 
December 8 that the Foreign Affairs Ministry had no 
objections to the most recent U.S. criteria-based proposal 
for the Nuclear Suppliers Group.  Bochenski said he will 
forward the text this week to the Ministry of Economy for its 
final approval.  He does not foresee any objections and will 
notify us when the text is approved.
