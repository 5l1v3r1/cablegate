SUBJECT: RESPONSE TO BLUE LANTERN PRE-LICENSE END USE CHECK 
ON APPLICATION 05-050127510 
 
REF: STATE 113557 
 
¶1.  Econoff was unable to verify the validity of a battery 
shipment order placed by Canada Department of National 
Defense (DND) identified in reftel. 
 
¶2.  Alaine Girard, Manager of the government of Canada,s 
Public Works office responsible for DND battery procurement, 
said he was not able to identify an order based on the 
information in reftel.  He 
stated that a purchase order starting with the letter  W, 
is necessary for him to identify a file or contract number 
that might enable him to track the items in question.  Girard 
stated that the batteries may have been part of a larger 
equipment order that had been subcontracted.  He was able to 
locate older transactions with Ultralife, but these previous 
orders contained no battery information.  He also stated that 
given the low dollar value of the contract it could have been 
ordered by the USG equivalent of a purchase card, in which 
case he would not have the order data. 
 
¶3.  While Girard was not able to verify this particular 
order, he said orders for products like this seemed 
reasonable to him.  If Ultralife can provide the original 
purchase order with an ID number beginning with a  W,, 
Girard said he would be happy to assist in verifying this 
order.
