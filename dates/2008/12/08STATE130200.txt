SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  The United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, and 
the U.S. (E4 1) have agreed to pursue additional national 
measures to increase the pressure on Iran to end its 
proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities and ensure 
effective implementation of UNSC and EU sanctions.  After 
meeting on October 9, the EU4 1 identified Iran's deceptive 
practices as a threat to the international financial sector 
and a conduit for Iran's proliferation activities.  The E4 1 
agreed to a joint demarche as a way to inform governments 
about the risks that Iran poses to the financial industries 
in their jurisdictions.  Posts are requested to coordinate 
the delivery of the attached talking points to host 
governments with the local representatives of the United 
Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy.

OBJECTIVES/ACTION REQUEST 
------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Washington requests Posts deliver the talking 
points in paragraph 4 to appropriate host government 
officials in the foreign and finance ministries to host 
governments.  To maximize the impact of this demarche, 
delivery should be coordinated with the local representatives 
of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy.  For GCC 
posts: other GCC countries in addition to Oman and the UAE 
will be approached by our EU4 partners.  Note to Embassy 
Riyadh and Manama: this demarche has already been delivered 
to a number of GCC countries (REF A).  Post should pursue the 
following objectives: 
 
--  Remind host governments that full implementation of UN 
Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs) concerning Iran by all 
members of the international community is critical to 
addressing the proliferation threat posed by Iran and that 
many European countries and firms have determined that the 
risk of doing business with Iran is too great and, as a 
result, have reduced their business with Iran. 
 
-- Note that Iran's use of front companies and other 
deceptive practices in commercial and financial activities 
makes it difficult to know who is involved in a transaction, 
or the final end user or ultimate use of any goods. 
 
-- Note that within the scope of UNSCR 1747, States are 
required to take measures to prevent the provision to Iran of 
any financial assistance, or services related to the transfer 
of prohibited items. 
 
-- Urge host governments to ensure that their financial 
institutions do not provide services to any entities that are 
engaged in proliferation-related activities, specifically 
individuals and entities designated under UNSC resolutions 
1737, 1747 or 1803, as well as those designated by the USG 
under Executive Orders 13224 and 13382. 
 
-- Call upon host governments to implement UNSCR 1803's call 
for vigilance over the activities of their financial 
institutions with Iranian banks, including by adopting 
concrete financial vigilance measures, such as those adopted 
by the European Union (Common position 2008/652/CFSP of 7 
August 2008, Regulation 2008/1110/EC of 10 November 2008), 
and/or those recommended by the Financial Action Task Force's 
(FATF) in its October guidance on UNSCR 1803. 
 
-- Encourage host governments to warn their financial 
institutions about the risks of doing business with Iran, 
such as the Iranian regime using its state-owned firms to 
support proliferation-related activities.  The Iranian 
state-owned banks also use deceptive financial practices to 
support this illicit activity.

TALKING POINTS 
-------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) BEGIN TALKING POINTS 
 
-- Full implementation of UN Security Council Resolutions 
(UNSCRs) concerning Iran by all members of the international 
community is critical to addressing the threat posed by Iran. 
 UNSCR 1737 (2006) requires States to take measures to 
prevent the provision to Iran of any financial assistance or 
services (including brokering) related to the transfer, 
manufacture, or use of prohibited items. UNSCR 1747 (2007) 
calls upon States and international financial institutions 
not to enter into new commitments for providing financial 
assistance to the Government of Iran, except for humanitarian 
and developmental purposes. UNSCR 1803 (2008) calls on States 
to exercise vigilance over the activities of financial 
institutions in their territories with all banks domiciled in 
Iran and in providing financial support for trade with Iran, 
including insurance, in order to avoid contributing to Iran's 
nuclear and missile programs. Finally, UNSCRs 1737, 1747 and 
1803 require States to freeze the assets of and ensure that 
no economi 
c resources are provided by their nationals or from their 
territories to individuals or entities designated pursuant to 
these resolutions for their involvement in Iran's nuclear or 
ballistic missile programs. 
 
-- We have been discussing with the international banking 
sector the importance of implementation of the Iran-related 
UNSCRs, as this sector is vulnerable to the risk of 
unwittingly facilitating Iranian proliferation activities. We 
draw your attention to the reputational risk involved as well 
as the existing penalties in case of illicit activities. 
 
-- Financial vigilance measures are extremely important to 
defend against such risks. Key examples of measures targeted 
specifically against proliferation finance and Iran, 
including the EU Common position 2008/652/CFSP of 7 August 
2008, Regulation 2008/1110/EC of 10 November 2008, and FATF 
guidance on implementation of financial measures contained in 
¶1803. 
 
-- We are concerned that the financial sector is being 
exploited and used to facilitate activities prohibited by the 
UN, or that Iranian entities designated by the UN are using 
deceptive practices to evade sanctions or mask other 
activities of concern. 
 
-- To avoid providing financial services prohibited by the UN 
Security Council, we ask that you encourage your financial 
institutions to review among other things, services they may 
provide to Iranian companies and projects in Iran, as well as 
correspondent banking relationships with Iranian banks and 
financial institutions controlled by Iranian entities (cf. in 
the EU: Common position 2008/652/CFSP of 7 August 2008, 
Regulation 2008/1110/EC of 10 November 2008).
