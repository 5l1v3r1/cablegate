     ¶B. PETERSEN-BALLARD E-MAIL 11/26/2008 
 
¶1. (SBU) After multiple attempts to determine Logi-Sped's 
role in Blue Lantern (BL) end-use check 05-050057708, EconOff 
did not receive a satisfactory response addressing the 
questions in reftel.  Logi-Sped,s broker told us that he has 
no record of a transaction involving AES Shipping Number 
¶105437. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On November 20, EconOff contacted Logi-Sped, but 
was transferred to the company,s broker, Mr. Reinhard 
Hornung (who runs his own company, Reinhard Hornung Agency 
for Transport and Insurance).  (COMMENT: Hornung said his 
company was founded in 2004 and is an independent forwarding 
agent for Logi-Sped.  END COMMENT)  Although Hornung provided 
EconOff with a 22-page fax of miscellaneous documentation 
regarding ammunition shipments from the Olin Corporation to 
the Lebanese Internal Security Forces, none of it directly 
addressed the commodities involved in BL-LICENSE 
05-050057708.  After a second attempt to obtain the correct 
documentation, Hornung responded that his company was not and 
could not have been involved in any shipment beyond what he 
already provided. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Hornung said that his company has, since 2004, 
handled all Logi-Sped shipments concerning weapons or 
ammunition and that he personally handled all of these 
transactions.  Hornung maintains that his company has no 
record of involvement with AES Shipping Number 105437. 
Hornung added that no shipments beyond what he included in 
his provided documentation would have been possible due to a 
lack of "linear services available" for ammunition shipments 
between Germany and Lebanon for the reftel listed time frame. 
 (COMMENT: Hornung was generally very helpful and responsive 
to all Embassy inquiries.  END COMMENT)
