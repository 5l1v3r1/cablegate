Classified By: Economic Counselor Darnall Steuart for reasons 1.4 
(b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C) SUMMARY: The Venezuelan consumer protection law, 
passed July 2008, requires the government to approve all 
sales promotions with an eye to curtailing "excessive 
consumption" and punishing "capitalist impresarios" while 
also seeking to eliminate hoarding and speculation, 
particularly with food stuffs, medicines and cars.  The law, 
which lacks any implementing legislation, is wide open to 
interpretation and has led to odd rulings resulting in 
frequent restaurant closures and bans on such promotions as 
fast food combo meals and "two for one Tuesdays".  While some 
franchises have reached a temporary compromise with the 
consumer protection agency on how they can reinstate their 
popular promotions without violating the vague provisions of 
the law, the Venezuelan Franchise Chamber reports confusion 
regarding the new law still reigns in the industry and 
opportunities for official corruption are rife.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (C) On November 25, Emboffs met with XXXXXXXXXXXX Franquicias XXXXXXXXXXXX(protect) to discuss the new consumer protection law. 
XXXXXXXXXXXX called the new law, which was one of the 26 laws the 
Venezuelan government passed in July 2008 (ref A), "very 
dangerous" with ample opportunities for corruption.  Because 
the government has failed to establish any implementing 
regulations, Institute for the Defense of Persons in their 
Access to Goods and Services (Indepabis) inspectors are free 
to interpret the law as they see fit.  As a result, Indepabis 
inspectors have fined and assisted in the closure of 
franchises (ref B), with the latter resulting in considerable 
tax revenue losses for the government, and ruled numerous 
sales promotions illegal.  Indepabis explained that in the 
case of Domino's, "two for one Tuesdays" discriminated 
against persons (Indepabis does not like the word consumer as 
it is too capitalist) who would like to eat pizza on the 
other days of the week.  XXXXXXXXXXXX added the government is trying 
to punish high profile "capitalist impresarios" in its quest 
to advance its socialist, anti-consumerism agenda. 
 
¶3. (C) McDonald's Latin American Global Communications 
Manager told the Commercial section on December 1 that, of 
its 134 restaurants in Venezuela, more than half of them 
receive daily Indepabis inspections.  XXXXXXXXXXXX indicated that 
franchises such as McDonald's and Domino's have their lawyers 
working around the clock to figure out ways to save 
promotions such as the ever popular combo meal and two for 
one promotions.  Some appear to have reached tentative 
agreements with Indepabis.  Nevertheless, XXXXXXXXXXXX reported the 
industry still does not know what the law means for 
franchises, and restaurants fear the government could shut 
them down at any time for any reason.  The businesses have no 
recourse for wrongful closure and fines as the Franchise 
Chamber feels no court would seriously entertain their 
appeals.  Pharmacies have also been affected with Indepabis 
banning economy sizes of over the counter medicines. 
Indepabis reasoned that larger sizes encourage the "excessive 
consumption" of medicine.  Indepabis is also involved in the 
possible prosecution of Ford dealers for "excessive profits" 
(ref C). 
 
¶4. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX added that he sends weekly meeting requests to 
Indepabis in the hopes that the agency will sit down with a 
coalition of chambers from various industries to discuss the 
law.  In spite of the bottle neck caused by companies waiting 
for approval for each of their proposed sales promotions, 25 
percent of which Indepabis disapproves, the franchise 
business is still booming.  Prior to the elections, XXXXXXXXXXXX 
said, the government was so busy campaigning it was not 
taking care of the daily business of running the country. 
Following the elections, XXXXXXXXXXXX is hopeful that the industry 
will be able to develop a reasonable relationship with 
Indepabis in spite of his sense that Indepabis feels there is 
simply "too much advertising."  In his opinion, restaurant 
closures and promotion bans were wildly unpopular with the 
public and Indepabis might now be more inclined to sit down 
with industry to discuss transparent implementing 
regulations.  He complained, however, that the minute the 
Chamber starts to make inroads with one minister and his 
staff, they are replaced and the Chamber has to begin again. 
 
 
¶5. (C) COMMENT:  The sometimes comical Indepabis rulings 
serve as yet more examples of the Venezuelan government's 
visceral distaste for big business.  As the government faces 
falling oil prices and the subsequent shortage of dollars, 
more attacks on foreign companies that promote "excessive 
consumption" are likely.  Nevertheless, as XXXXXXXXXXXX opined, 
while the government can change the rules of the game as 
often as it likes, it cannot stop the game from being played. 
 For the sake of US franchises, car sales etc., one can only 
hope he is correct.  END COMMENT.
