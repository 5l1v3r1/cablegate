-- China has begun preparations to send naval vessels to the Gulf of 
Aden. 
 
-- China "expresses sincere thanks" to the Malaysian Government for 
its assistance in the rescue of the Chinese ship captured by pirates

Rescue of Chinese Freighter and Somali Piracy 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. China "has begun preparations" to send PLA Naval vessels to the 
waters off Somalia, said MFA spokesman Liu Jianchao at the December 
18 regular press briefing. Liu said that in recent years "rampant 
piracy" in the Gulf of Aden has created "a threat to international 
navigation, trade and naval security."  Liu listed statistics on 
piracy off the coast of Somalia and noted that one Chinese ship and 
eighteen people remain in the custody of pirates.  China "has taken 
this action [to send ships] in accordance with Article 7 of the UN 
Charter," said Liu adding that the Government of Somalia "welcomes" 
the decision.  China made the decision to send the ships because it 
supports "stronger international cooperation" to counter piracy, 
said Liu. 
 
¶3. Asked for details of the capture and rescue of a Chinese vessel 
yesterday, Liu said that nine pirates boarded a Chinese ship on 
December 17.  The Chinese Government "took the matter seriously" and 
"relevant authorities arranged for a rescue." The Chinese Government 
"sent a distress message to the International Maritime Bureau" after 
which, the "Malaysian anti-piracy center sent an armed helicopter, a 
warship and another helicopter to the rescue."  Thanks to their 
assistance, "the pirates were fended off." China "expresses sincere 
thanks" to Malaysia for its work in rescuing the Chinese crew, 
adding that the action "should serve as a good example" of how to 
deal with pirates.  (NOTE:  Post notes that, although the 
International Maritime Bureau Piracy Center is in Kuala Lumpur, the 
naval vessels that actually rescued the Chinese freighter were part 
of a multi-national group.  END NOTE.) 
 
The Sakharov Prize to Hu Jia 
---------------------------- 
 
¶4. The European Union Parliament is "already aware" of China's 
position on Hu Jia's being awarded the Sakharov Prize, said Liu. 
"Whatever intentions the European Union may have," said Liu, China 
will continue to develop "socialism with Chinese characteristics" 
and run China "according to law." 
 
30th Anniversary of Reform 
-------------------------- 
 
¶5. Liu said that he "listened hard" to Hu Jintao's speech 
commemorating the thirtieth anniversary of reform.  The speech was 
"very long," said Liu, and will "take time to digest." 
 
Nobel Prize Corruption 
---------------------- 
 
¶6. The spokesman had "no knowledge of" reports that officials on the 
Nobel Prize committee have taken trips to China paid for by the 
Chinese Government.
