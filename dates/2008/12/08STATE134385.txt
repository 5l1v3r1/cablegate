¶1. (U) Summary:  According to the German government, the 
German-proposed International Renewable Energy Agency 
(IRENA), which will launch on January 26 - 27, 2009 in 
Bonn, Germany, is intended to promote increased use of 
renewable energy.  While the USG strongly supports 
renewable energy, the USG opposes IRENA on the grounds 
that it will duplicate existing work in the renewable 
energy field and the USG does not plan to attend the 
launch of the organization.  Additionally, IRENA's mission 
and objectives remain unclear.  This cable provides 
guidance, for use as needed.  The Department requests (see 
paragraph seven) post reporting on host government 
position when the occasion to discuss IRENA presents 
itself. End Summary. 
 
BACKGROUND 
 
¶2. (SBU) Germany began promoting its IRENA proposal in 
2004, at which time the idea was dismissed by the USG, 
Japan, Canada and others.  Initially, the German Federal 
Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation 
and Nuclear Safety was pushing for IRENA, and the German 
Economic Ministry (which represents Germany at the 
International Energy Agency (IEA)) was not supportive. 
Germany resurrected the proposal following the G8 
Summit in Heiligendamm, and decided in spring 2008 to 
press ahead, regardless of support from other major 
developed nations.  The USG, Australia, Canada, Japan, and 
the UK sent embassy representatives as unofficial 
observers to an April 2008 IRENA preparation conference. 
Several developing countries, including Colombia, 
China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and South Africa, 
expressed support for IRENA.  At an IEA Governing Board 
meeting December 17, the Danish representative stated that 
in addition to his country and Germany, the 
following European countries had agreed to join IRENA: 
Spain, Poland, Romania, Austria, Iceland, and Finland. 
According to the Danes, Sweden and Norway were actively 
reviewing the issue. 
 
¶3. (U) As we understand it, IRENA's initial annual budget 
would be 25 million Euro per year.  Germany projects the 
budget will gradually increase to E125 million.  [Note: 
the International Energy Agency's annual budget is about 
E25 million (approximately $36.5 million) per year, of 
which about E1 million is for work on renewables. 
End note.]  At IEA meetings the week of December 15, 
representatives of Spain, Denmark and Germany noted that 
other countries might also contribute funding (perhaps to 
a total E50 million) and that IRENA HQ would be in one 
of the three countries. 
 
¶4. (SBU) IEA Executive Director Tanaka met with German 
Environment Ministry officials in the fall to review the 
IEA's existing work on renewable energy.  Tanaka wants to 
develop an MOU with Germany so that the IEA's work and 
the projected work of IRENA are not duplicative. 
According to Tanaka, the Germans have indicated they 
do not want IRENA to overlap with the IEA's work, which is 
focused on integration of renewables into the 
power grid. 
 
¶5.  (U) TALKING POINTS: Posts may draw upon the points 
below as needed. 
 
-- The U.S. is committed to increasing renewable energy 
domestically and around the world.  The USG has 
demonstrated its commitment to the vast potential of 
renewable energy in programs ranging from increased 
renewable energy R&D to enhanced commercialization and 
innovative financing mechanisms for these 
technologies.  This commitment was manifested in the 
USG-hosted Washington International Renewable Energy 
Conference (WIREC) in March, 2008. 
--  A new international institution is not the optimal 
means for encouraging the expanded use of renewable 
energy. 
--  A new international institution would duplicate 
multilateral cooperation on renewable energy. 
Strengthening the work of existing networks and 
institutions, as appropriate, is the most efficient way 
to encourage broader use of renewable energy. 
-- For those developing countries seeking to expand their 
use of renewable energy, there are a range of 
 
STATE 00134385  002 OF 002 
 
 
bilateral and multilateral sources for technical and 
policy assistance.  Rather than creating a new 
international agency, existing efforts should be 
strengthened. 
--  Appropriate vehicles to achieve greater implementation 
and integration of renewable energy 
technologies into the global energy economy include 
international organizations such as the International 
Energy Agency (IEA), which recently increased its 
engagement in renewable energy analysis, coupled with 
agile public-private partnerships, such as the 
German-created Renewable Energy Policy Network of the 21st 
Century (REN21), the Renewable Energy and Energy 
Efficiency Partnership (REEEP), and the Asia-Pacific 
Partnership on Clean Development and Climate?s (APP) 
Renewable Energy Task Force. 
-- Since renewable energy technologies are becoming 
mainstream in energy economies worldwide, now is not 
the time to isolate these technologies from others with 
which they compete and complement.  Isolating 
renewable energy with its own international agency runs 
the risk of isolating these technologies and marginalizing 
their fit in the variegated energy 
profiles of all countries. 
-- IRENA organizers are uncertain as to precisely what the 
IRENA work plan would entail beyond the 
generalities of promoting increased use of renewable 
energy technologies through ?enhanced policy advice, 
sustained capacity building and effective transfer of 
technology and know-how.? 
-- Developing countries that are planning to join IRENA 
clearly are attracted by IRENA backers advertising 
it as a way to promote technology transfer.  But we have 
not received a clear response as to how IRENA 
would transfer technology that is for the most part 
controlled by the private sector. 
-- IF ASKED:  The USG does not plan to participate in the 
January launch of the IRENA. 
 
(6)     (U) ACTION REQUEST: The Department appreciates 
post reporting on host government?s position on IRENA. 
Please slug responses for EEB/ESC Danielle Monosson and 
OES/EGC Griff Thompson. 
 
(7) (U) Minimize considered.
