SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN POST-SHIPMENT END USE CHECK ON 
LICENSE 050102478 
 
¶1.  This is an action message.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2.  The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post assistance in conducting a 
post-shipment check for the export of AWACS aircraft spare 
parts to France.  Post is requested to complete this Blue 
Lantern check within 45 days.  Lack of response to a Blue 
Lantern check will affect pending and future licenses 
involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3.  Reason for request: Jane's and other open source Order of 
Battle information shows that the French Air Force operates 
four U.S.-origin E-3F Sentry AWACS aircraft.  However, the 
purchase order from the Foreign Intermediate Consignee, 
Satori, states that the Foreign End User of the spare parts 
is the French Army. 
 
¶4.  ACTION: Please contact the French Ministry of Defense and 
verify its request for the quantity and type of the 
commodities listed below.  Please also confirm intended use. 
END ACTION.
