¶1.  (U) On December 9, 2008, representatives of Nicaragua's 
Ministry of Agriculture (MAGFOR) informed post's USDA rep 
that Nicaragua had overturned its 2004 ban on the importation 
of U.S. live cattle, sheep and goats, consistent with the 
2007 recommendation of the World Organization for Animal 
Health (OIE).  According to the Ministerial Agreement 
received by USDA, Nicaragua now permits the importation of 
live cattle, sheep and goats from countries, including the 
U.S., that meet OIE conditions in regard to controlling the 
risk for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), also known 
as "mad cow" disease.  The Ministerial Agreement, however, 
only permits the importation of live cattle, sheep and goats 
from qualified countries.  It does not specify nor permit the 
importation of beef and beef products, even though OIE 
standards regarding BSE are the same for beef and beef 
products as for live animals. 
 
¶2.  (U) In 2007, more than three years after the first case 
of BSE in the U.S. prompted Central American countries to 
halt the importation of U.S. cattle and beef, the OIE 
unanimously adopted a recommendation that the United States 
be recognized as having "controlled" risk status for BSE. 
The OIE controlled risk classification provided an objective 
international recognition that the control measures in place 
in the U.S. effectively manage any BSE risk. 
 
¶3.  (U) The Ministerial Agreement, which is dated September 
2008, was delivered to USDA rep at post on December 9. 
Post's USDA rep contacted MAGFOR's Chief of Animal Health 
Mauricio Pichardo to further inquire about the Agreement. 
Pichardo verified that the Agreement referred only to cattle, 
sheep and goats and not to beef, and he promised to consult 
the Ministry's legal office to determine the reason why 
Nicaragua continues to ban the importation of U.S. beef and 
beef products. 
 
¶4.  (U) Comment:  It is possible that MAGFOR'S omission of 
beef is unintentional.  Post is hopeful that the Nicaraguan 
market will be fully opened to beef and beef products within 
a short period of time.  USDA has been working for more than 
18 months to persuade Nicaragua to open its market to U.S. 
cattle and beef.  The December 2003 discovery of BSE in the 
U.S. prompted all Central American countries to take steps to 
close their markets to these products.  In May of 2007, the 
OIE's recommendation that the U.S. be classified as 
"controlled risk" for BSE provided strong support that U.S. 
regulatory controls were effective and U.S. cattle and cattle 
products could be safely traded internationally.  Since the 
OIE announcement, Nicaragua had been the only Central 
American country to resist opening its market to U.S. cattle 
and beef.
