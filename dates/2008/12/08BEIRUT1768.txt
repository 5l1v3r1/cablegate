The Russian MiG-29 airplane "gift" to Lebanon eclipsed all other 
events, even the shoe-throwing incident.  All newspapers headlined 
the "surprising" and "unexpected" Russian gift, noting that the 
Lebanese Minister of Defense did not expect it.  Several newspapers 
highlighted the qualities of the MiG-29 airplanes, observing that 
they are a quality addition to the Lebanese Army's capabilities. 
They also claimed that such a gift means that the international 
community has labeled Lebanon as a sovereign, independent country. 
Only Arab nationalist As-Safir questioned whether Russia has given 
Lebanon this gift, noting that neither the Russian authorities nor 
the Russian Ambassador to Lebanon confirmed the news.

"The MiG-29 Is a Positive Shock for Lebanese Public Opinion, but 
Raises Western Diplomatic Questions," an editorial by Khalil Flayhan 
in moderate, anti-Syrian An-Nahar (12/17): 
 
"Minister of Defense Elias El-Murr's announcement that Russia agreed 
to provide the Army with ten MiG-29 fighter airplanes was a positive 
shock for the Lebanese.  American, European, and Arab circles, 
however, wondered over the news.  Diplomatic sources in Beirut noted 
that Israel is most likely to criticize this deal sharply and will 
claim that it is a direct threat against its security.  ...As a 
result, Israel will probably increase its aerial violations of 
Lebanese airspace.  ...Experts in military airplanes noted that this 
is the first time Lebanon will be buying Russian arms.  ...They 
expressed the belief that this change means that Lebanon has started 
to change its strategy.  ...They also noted that Syria has about 500 
of these airplanes...but the newer version is the MiG 32 or 35. 
...The same sources were not 'excited' about this surprise because 
'no one knows how to work on these airplanes in the near future.' 
They noted that the Army needs light airplanes Lebanese pilots are 
trained for..."
