SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Harare EAC convened on 15 December to review the 
Embassy's Tripwires, specifically, the areas of 
medical/natural disasters in light of the growing cholera 
situation (Ref A), holiday security planning and the larger 
security situation. In evaluating holiday security, the EAC 
endorsed continuation of the current security posture.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------------- 
EAC REVIEWS HOLIDAY SECURITY PLANNING 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Harare EAC convened on 15 December.  Charge 
d'Affaires, a.i. chaired the meeting, which was attended by 
the DCM, RSO, POL, CONS, MGT, DAO, R/POL, PAO, USAID, IMO, 
MED, and GSO. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Embassy Harare does not have any more scheduled, 
major holiday events planned for this holiday season.  RSO, 
DAO and R/POL all agreed that there are no known, specific 
threats to the American community in Zimbabwe.  RSO continues 
to maintain close security contacts with friendly missions. 
RSO Harare will maintain sufficient security staffing during 
the holiday season. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The EAC agreed that the security measures already 
implemented by the Mission are appropriate.  The only shuttle 
service utilized by the Embassy is the school shuttle to/from 
Harare International School (HIS).  School is currently on 
holiday break until 4 January.  If the situation requires, 
RSO's SDT personnel will provide coverage for this shuttle in 
January.  All other security measures will remain unchanged. 
RSO has planned emergency drills for the Embassy's facilities 
during the coming weeks, and will participate in a Town Hall 
meeting with the Embassy community. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) NOTE:  Police coverage continues to be absent from 
USAID and the Embassy.  Additional contract guards (LGF) have 
supplemented coverage in the short term.  MGT/RSO was 
requested by MFA to meet with them on 15 December regarding 
this issue.  When MGT and RSO arrived at MFA, it was apparent 
that MFA had forgotten about the reason for the requested 
meeting, and they had no further information from the ZRP 
Commissioner regarding the lack of police coverage.  END NOTE. 
 
----------- 
CONCLUSION 
----------- 
 
¶6.  (U) The EAC will continue to closely monitor the health 
situation, as well as the fluid security situation.  Although 
there are not currently direct security threats to the 
Embassy community, the overall political situation remains a 
primary concern.  The EAC will convene again in the coming 
weeks or as appropriate.
