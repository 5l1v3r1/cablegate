SUBJECT: French Agriculture Minister's Letter to Commerce Secretary 
Gutierrez on Information Request For High Seas Driftnet Fishing 
Moratorium Protection Act 
 
REF: State 00100509 
 
¶1. (SBU) French Agriculture and Fisheries (MAP) Minister Barnier 
sent a letter to US Commerce Secretary Gutierrez responding to the 
Embassy's demarches requesting information for the January 2009 
Magnuson-Stevens Act report now being prepared by the Commerce 
Department's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and by the OES 
Bureau.  Following up October 28 meeting between MAP officials and 
the Embassy's Counselor for Environment, Science, Technology and 
Health (ESTH), Minister Barnier offered to provide any additional 
information needed by NMFS and OES.  At the October 25 meeting, MAP 
officials told ESTH Counselor that, to enforce the EU Commission's 
2007 decision banning use of all nets for blue fin tuna fishing, the 
French deployed their Navy and that French fishing vessels caught 
using nets had been punished.  Previously, the French position had 
been that thonaille nets for tuna were not driftnets, but the 2007 
EU Commission decision banning all nets ended that debate, and 
subsequently the French enforced the EU decision. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Unofficial Embassy translation of text of letter sent by 
French Agriculture Minister Michel Barnier to Secretary of Commerce 
Carlos Gutierrez dated November 21, 2008 
 
Dear Secretary Gutierrez 
 
The U.S. Embassy in Paris informally visited the Agriculture 
Ministry on October 28 to enquire about steps taken by French 
authorities concerning the management of blue fin tuna in the 
Mediterranean Sea. 
 
I would like to point out that this issue comes under the purview of 
(European Union's) common fisheries policy and therefore it would 
also be useful to question the European Commission.  Consequently, I 
will also keep the European Commissioner in charge of Fisheries 
informed of the answer provided here. 
 
I understand that your questions are based on information supplied 
by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic 
tunas (ICCAT)  and on the report released in October 2006 by the 
non-governmental organization OCEANA, "Thonaille: the use of 
driftnets by the French fleet in the Mediterranean." 
 
I also understand that these questions are raised in the context of 
the preparation of the first biennial report to the U.S. Congress, 
in accordance with the U.S. Magnuson-Stevens Act on Fishery 
Conservation and Management as amended on January 12, 2007.  This 
legislation requires the identification of states whose fishing 
boats have been involved in IUU fishing or by-catch of protected 
marine resources. 
 
I hope that the attached information will help you understand French 
fisheries management in the Mediterranean.  The members of my 
cabinet, the Head of the Maritime Fisheries and Fish Farming 
Division, and myself remain at your disposal for any further 
information you may need. 
 
Very sincerely 
 
handwritten greetings by Minister Barnier 
 
handwritten signature "Michel Barnier" 
 
¶3.  As mentioned in the letter, MAP has provided by email four 
additional documents all in French on its fishing practices, which 
have been forwarded to NMFS and OES in Washington.  The four 
additional documents include a ten page memo entitled "Management of 
Blue Fin Tuna Fishing in France"; the law of January 9, 1852 as most 
recently amended on January 5, 2006 concerning the regulation of the 
French fishing industry; EU Commission Regulation (CE) number 
2740/1999 dated December 21, 1999 on implementing regulations 
regarding behavior that gravely violates (EU) community fishing 
policies; and EU Council regulation 1006/2008 dated September 29, 
2008 concerning authorization for EU fishing vessels outside of EU 
waters and access of third country vessels to EU waters.
