SUBJECT: PHASE 3 VOTER REGISTRATION TAKES UP THE CHALLENGE 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  The Independent Elections Commission (IEC) reports 
that on December 13, the first day of Phase 3 voter 
registration, 123 of 124 planned voter registration sites 
opened. Some 7,000 Afghans in Farah, Zabul, Paktika, Khost, 
Nangarhar, and Laghman provinces signed up to vote, with 
turnout to date greatest in populous Nangarhar. The IEC will 
move the unopened site, originally planned for Khaki Afghan 
district in Zabul province, out of this area of Taliban 
control to the closest bazaar, in Shah Joy district.  The IEC 
expects to open the alternative site in the next few days.

TALIBAN SAY NO, VOTERS SAY YES 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  The Taliban on December 11 kidnapped two election 
workers in Bakwah district Farah province.  Local elders 
secured their release the next day. The Taliban also fired 
mortars near the voter registration site in Kanesk in Farah; 
it is not clear whether the target was the voter site or 
other nearby government facilities.  Registration staff are 
keeping both the Bakwah and Kanesk sites open and report 
voters are registering there. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  The district field coordinator (DFC) in Mizan 
district in Zabul on December 13 told PRT officers that 
Taliban presence had limited his ability to conduct public 
outreach.  After one resident from a valley known as a 
Taliban stronghold appeared in the district center and 
obtained his new card, however, turnout picked up markedly. 
In downtown Qalat, where PRT officers observed high spirits 
at the two voter registration centers, a merry elder voter 
fluffed his beard before his registration card photo. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Threats from the Taliban prompted two successive 
registration center teams to quit in Sabari district in 
Khost.  The Provincial Electoral Officer (PEO) has hired, 
trained, and deployed a third team.  In two districts in 
Khost, the Taliban circulated letters threatening to "attack" 
citizens who obtain voter registration cards. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  Police have detailed information on an election 
worker kidnapped from his home December 13 by the Taliban in 
Paktika province and are planning possible responses.  Press 
reports say the Taliban killed one of the six musicians 
kidnapped at the same time; the Taliban spokesman claims the 
victim died of a heart attack. 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  Registration is underway without security 
incidents in Laghman and Nangarhar.  In Zabul, local police 
arrested a district field coordinator (DFC) on charges of 
theft, unrelated to his election responsibilities.

GETTING BETTER AND BETTER 
------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU)  The IEC is demonstrating continued improvement in 
its capabilities.  Logistics, security cooperation, and 
public outreach are much improved after initial stumbles in 
Phase 1 in October.  Logistics and security problems, for 
example, meant sites opened late in the Phase 1 provinces of 
Nuristan, Ghazni, Wardak, and Logar. For Phase 3, logistics 
were fully arranged at all centers, and despite intimidation 
in a number of areas, only the one Zabul site was prevented 
from opening on day one. Deputy Chief Electoral Officer 
Zekria Barakzai on December 14 commented that the IEC knows 
that Phase 3, and subsequently Phase 4, will require it to 
demonstrate flexibility and creativity to get the job done. 
 
¶8.  (SBU)  Popular support remains an important factor in the 
success of voter registration despite poor infrastructure, 
inhospitable terrain, and threats from anti-government armed 
forces.  The governors of Khost and Farah staged media events 
to encourage voters to register, including tribal elders, 
religious leaders, and women to appeal to various sectors of 
the public.  In Laghman and Nangarhar, election workers are 
supplementing the radio and TV media campaigns with meetings 
with local elders.  In Zabul, voter registration was the 
topic of the Friday sermon.  Election workers there have held 
small community meetings and encouraged local mullahs to help 
get out the vote.  Kuchi leaders report they are rallying 
their nomadic community as well.
