On October 29, Post delivered ref A demarche on human cloning to 
both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Health and 
Social Development, seeking Russian support on this issue at UNESCO 
meetings of the International Bioethics Committee and 
Intergovernmental Bioethics Committee in Paris October 28-29.  On 
November 27, we received a written response explaining the status of 
Russian legislation from Ivan Dubov, Director of the Health 
Ministry's International Cooperation Department.  Dubov wrote that 
that Russia passed a federal law banning human cloning for a period 
of five years ending June 23, 2007.  Draft amendments to the law 
have been drafted and are in the process of being considered.  These 
amendments would continue the temporary ban on all human cloning, 
including for reproductive, therapeutic, and scientific purposes. 
The draft amendments provide for the ban to remain in place pending 
the passage of a new law establishing regulations for the use of 
cloning technology.
