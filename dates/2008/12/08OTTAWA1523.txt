DELIVERED 
 
REF: STATE 127557 
 
¶1. (SBU) Post delivered text of reftel letter to the office 
of Foreign Minister Cannon on December 5. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Charge followed up with a phone call the same day to 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) 
Assistant Deputy Minister for Asia and Africa Ken Sundquist 
(U/S equivalent) to reinforce the Secretary's request for 
Canadian contributions to purchase heavy fuel oil (HFO). 
Acting Political Counselor called on North Asia Director 
General Phil Calvert, as well.  Both Sundquist and Calvert 
are on official travel in Vancouver until December 8, 
according to North Asia Deputy Director Karen Foss.  She also 
told Acting Political Counselor that Canadian embassy 
officials in Washington had briefed she and Calvert on their 
recent discussions with Department officials on the need for 
additional HFO contributions.  Foss said Sundquist, Calvert, 
and Assistant Deputy Minister for International Security 
Colleen Swords, who is also away on official travel, will 
study the Secretary's letter and confer among themselves to 
prepare a recommendation for Minister Cannon.  Foss suggested 
that phone calls from the Charge to both Assistant Deputy 
Ministers would be "important" to securing an expeditious 
response from Canada.  The Charge and Political Counselor 
will continue to press for a Canadian contribution when the 
Assistant Deputy Minister and Director General return to 
Ottawa next week.
