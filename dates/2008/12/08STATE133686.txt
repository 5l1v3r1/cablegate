¶1. (U) The Department has reviewed its files and finds that

that visa applications for the individuals be filed with as 
much time as possible to allow for additional processing 
procedures that may be required.  Note that if, at any time,

a gross violation of human rights by these individuals, the 
Embassy should so inform the Department.
