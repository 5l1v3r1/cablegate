REF: STATE 132095 
 
¶1. (SBU) Poloff conveyed points on increasing financial 
pressure on Iran (reftel) December 24 to Fernando Gonzalez in 
the Office of the UN Security Council at the Secretariat of 
Foreign Relations (SRE).  Gonzalez commented that the 
Government of Mexico (GOM) supports full implementation of 
the Security Council Resolutions on Iran, including UNSCR 
¶1747.  He said that the legal department of SRE has been 
working on a new law for the last six months that would 
impose on proper authorities an obligation to implement 
security council resolutions, including those pertaining to 
Iran.  Gonzalez remarked that the legal counsel of the 
President already had approved the draft measure and hoped 
that it would be introduced and passed by Congress over the 
next year. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Poloff reached out to representatives of the 
European countries working with us on increasing financial 
pressure on Iran with a view to organizing a joint demarche. 
However, in the interest of time, as these representatives 
were not/not ready to pursue a joint demarche (at least one 
had not yet received instructions from its capital) Poloff 
pursued this matter directly with SRE.  Inasmuch as Mexico 
supports the implementation of UNSC resolutions pertaining to 
Iran, unless instructed otherwise, Embassy will not pursue a 
joint demarche with representatives from the European 
countries.
