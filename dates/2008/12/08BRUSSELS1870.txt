SUBJECT: BELGIUM ARRESTS FOURTEEN SUSPECTED TERRORISTS 
 
¶1. (U) Belgian police arrested December 11 fourteen terrorist 
suspects, according to press reporting.  A total of 242 
police officers conducted a series of sixteen raids in 
Brussels and one in the Francophone city of Liege.  According 
to the Belgian prosecutors office, the suspects were linked 
to a Belgian Islamist group involved in training and fighting 
along the Pakistan border, and were in communication with 
important figures in Al Qaeda. 
 
¶2. (U) In his press statement, Belgian Prosecutor Johan 
Delmulle said the target of the planned terrorist attack was 
unknown, but could have been in Pakistan, Afghanistan, or a 
European target, such as the December 11-12 European Union 
Summit being held in Brussels.  Delmulle stated that one of 
the suspects had received a green light to carry out an 
operation, and had already said good-bye to his loved ones. 
The information that an attack of some sort was imminent, 
coupled with the start of the European Summit spurred the 
police to make the arrests. 
 
¶3. (U) During the December 11 press conference, Brussels 
Police Director Glenn Audenart said the group had been 
identified a year ago.  The federal prosecutor's office 
called the investigation one of the most important 
anti-terrorism operation in Belgium, claiming that it likely 
prevented an attack from being carried out in Brussels. 
 
¶4. (U)  One of the fourteen suspects arrested, Malika 
El-Aroud, runs several jihadist websites and is an icon in 
the radical Islamist community.  She is the widow of one of 
the Belgian-nationals who committed suicide to kill Afghan 
General Massood's September 9, 2001. 
 
¶5. (U) In a joint statement Justice Minister Jo Vanderuzen 
and Interior Minister Patrick Dewael congratulated the 
security services on a job well done.  Referring to last 
December's terror alert, the two minister pointed out that 
today's arrests vindicated the security service assessment 
that a threat existed last year. 
 
¶6. (U) Comment: Belgian Federal Police received some 
vindication today by making arrests after a year long 
investigation.  The Federal Police were widely panned in the 
media and criticized for the heightened terrorist alert that 
canceled seasonal festivities last December.  It turns out 
there was a reason for concern, as today's arrests show.  It 
is now clear that Belgian authorities are able to investigate 
and pursue terrorists on Belgian soil.
