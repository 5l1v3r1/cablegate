SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERED: UNSC SOMALIA PIRACY RESOLUTION 
 
REF: STATE 130496 
 
(SBU) On December 15, the Ambassador delivered reftel points to Vice 
Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh, urging Vietnam to support a new 
UNSCR on Somali piracy at the UNSC Ministerial December 16.  VFM 
Minh acknowledged that robust action was necessary to combat piracy, 
but said that Vietnam's UN Mission had reservations about operative 
paragraph four, which it would relate directly in discussions in New 
York.  Before Vietnam comes to a position on the proposed new 
resolution, it would weigh heavily the briefing from Somalia's 
Foreign Minister on December 16.
