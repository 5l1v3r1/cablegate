SUBJECT: INSTRUCTION: ADOPTION OF UNSC PRST ON THE LRA - 
DECEMBER 22 
 
 ¶1.  USUN is instructed to join consensus on the UN Security 
Council Presidential Statement on the Lord's Resistance Army 
(LRA) to be adopted on December 22 (para 2).  USUN should 
refer any further substantive changes on the PRST to the 
Department prior to joining consensus for adoption. 
 
¶2. Begin text: 
 
¶1.    The Security Council is grateful for the efforts 
undertaken by His Excellency Mr Joaquim Chissano, former 
President of Mozambique, as the Secretary-General's Special 
Envoy for the Lord,s Resistance Army (LRA)- affected areas. 
The Council expresses its appreciation for his briefing of 17 
December 2008, and agrees with his recommendation that the 
peace efforts should continue.  The Council welcomes 
President Chissano,s readiness to continue in his role for a 
further period. 
 
¶2.    The Security Council reiterates its welcome for the 
Final Peace Agreement (FPA), negotiated between the 
Government of Uganda and the LRA, and reached through the 
Juba Peace Process. The Council commends the Government of 
Uganda for its continued commitment to the FPA and its 
investment in the peace process. 
 
¶3.    The Security Council condemns the repeated failure of 
Joseph Kony to sign the FPA.  It calls upon the LRA to sign 
and honour the FPA immediately and to begin the process of 
Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration to ensure a 
peaceful, political solution. 
 
¶4.    The Security Council strongly condemns the recent 
attacks by the LRA in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
and Southern Sudan, which pose a continuing threat to 
regional security.  It demands that the LRA cease its 
recruitment and use of children and that it release 
immediately all women, children and other non combatants, in 
accordance with Security Council resolution 1612 (2005). 
The Council reiterates its deep concern at the long-running 
and brutal insurgency by the LRA in northern Uganda which has 
caused the death, abduction and displacement of thousands of 
innocent civilians in Uganda, the Sudan and the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo. 
 
¶5.    The Security Council recalls the International Criminal 
Court arrest warrants for certain LRA leaders on charges of, 
among other things, war crimes and crimes against humanity, 
including murder, rape and the enlistment of children through 
abduction. The Council recalls its statement of June 2006 
(PRST/2006/28), and reaffirms that it attaches vital 
importance to promoting justice and the rule of law, 
including respect for human rights, as an indispensable 
element for lasting peace.  The Council reaffirms that ending 
impunity is essential for a society recovering from conflict 
to come to terms with past abuses committed against civilians 
and to prevent their recurrence. 
 
¶6.    The Security Council commends the States in the region 
for their increased co-operation, and welcomes the joint 
efforts they have made to address the security threat posed 
by the LRA.  The Council calls upon these States to ensure 
that all actions are carried out in accordance with 
international humanitarian, human rights and refugee law and 
to take appropriate measures to protect civilians.  The 
Council encourages these States to keep the UN missions in 
the region informed about their actions. 
 
¶7.    The Security Council welcomes the re-establishment of 
peace and security in northern Uganda.  It encourages the 
Government of Uganda, with the support of international 
partners, to honour its commitment to accelerate 
reconciliation, recovery and development in that region 
through rapid implementation of its Peace, Recovery and 
Development Plan (PRDP) and relevant Agenda items in the FPA 
and to disburse anticipated financing for the PRDP without 
delay. 
 
¶8.    The Security Council will continue to monitor the 
situation closely.
