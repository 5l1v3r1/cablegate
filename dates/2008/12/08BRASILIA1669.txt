REF: A. SECSTATE 130239 
     ¶B. BRASILIA 1557 
 
Classified By: Charge d'Affairs Lisa Kubiske, Reason 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1. (C) Following are mission's response to ref a, para 3. 
 
a) As reported ref B, the Ambassador delivered a diplomatic 
note to Brazilian Foreign Ministry (MRE) Under Secretary 
Vargas on November x informing the GOB of our intent to 
increase staffing at existing DEA offices in Brasilia and Sao 
Paulo.  Although he expressed concern about DEA's departure 
from Bolivia, Vargas did not offer a specific response at 
that time, and we have heard nothing further from MRE on the 
matter.  The Ambassador also discussed the issue with Justice 
Minister Tarso Genro (who sits over the Federal Police) and 
Institutional Security Minister Jorge Felix, both of whom 
were generally supportive.  Finally, DEA has discussed the 
matter extensively with the Federal Police, who are fully 
supportive of the increase in DEA staffing. 
 
Post has purposefully avoided requesting formal permission to 
increase these offices, as it is not strictly necessary in 
order to increase staffing at existing offices, and only MRE 
can grant it.  Such requests must go via diplomatic note 
through Transnational Crimes (COCIT) Director Virginia 
Toniatti and Secretary General (deputy foreign minister) 
Samuel Pinheiro Guimaraes, both of whom would likely hold up 
the request.  Having notified MRE of our plans at a senior 
level, mission is comfortable moving forward.  Therefore, 
mission recommends that DEA personnel who will be relocating 
to Brazil apply for visas soonest.  Issuance of the visas 
will effectively provide formal permission. 
 
b) Both Brasilia and Sao Paulo are willing and able to 
support the DEA positions listed above. 
 
c) Both Brasilia and Sao Paulo are willing and able to accept 
the DEA personnel (and dependents) listed above for 
reassignment prior to January 29, 2009.
