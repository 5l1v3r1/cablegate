¶1.  (SBU) On 12 December 2008, ECONOFF met Council for the Control 
of Financial Activities (COAF) official Bernardo Motta to follow up 
previous discussions regarding the recent USG designations of 
individuals and organizations as supporters of terrorism under 
Executive Order 13224 (refs A, B, and C). 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Following standard procedure, COAF entered the names of 
the designated individuals and organizations into to their databases 
and crosschecked them for matches.  The search yielded no results. A 
hit would have indicated that the designee, or its aliases, has 
assets, bank accounts or property in Brazil.  The official, however, 
cautioned that COAF has no way of knowing if a designee is using an 
alias if it is not provided.  According to the official, since its 
establishment, COAF has yet to find a match in its system from the 
lists shared by the USG. 
 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU) COAF, the official explained, forwards the names of the 
designees to the Brazilian Federal Police (DPF), the Brazilian 
National Intelligence Agency (ABIN), and the Brazilian Central Bank, 
who keep them in their databases for potential use in criminal 
investigations, intelligence analysis and operations, and financial 
tracking, respectively.  COAF does not share its information with 
third countries unless it has the originator's written consent. 
COAF noted the USG is the originator of 99 percent of COAF 
foreign-sourced data.
