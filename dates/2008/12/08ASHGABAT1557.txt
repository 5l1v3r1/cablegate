SUBJECT: TURKMENISTAN'S GAS DELIVERIES TO IRAN 
 
According to Turkmen sources, Turkmenistan's gas exports to 
Iran are shipped via the Korpeje-Kurt-Kui pipeline that runs 
parallel to the Caspian coast south from the Korpeje gas 
field.  The pipeline, which has a capacity of 14 bcm per 
year, was first put into operation in 1997.  Since that time, 
the amount of gas delivered annually has varied greatly. 
Despite the planned delivery of eight bcm in 2008, it appears 
that only five bcm of Turkmen gas will actually be sent to 
Iran, due to the cutoff of deliveries that occurred in 
January-March 2008.  Approximately two million ethnic Turkmen 
live in Northern Iran.
