(C) "Panama is not ready to consider deployment of U.S. gray 
hulled ships in Panamanian waters under (the) Salas-Becker 
(Maritime Cooperation Agreement)," First VP and FM Samuel 
Lewis informed Ambassador on December 22.  Ambassador had 
congratulated Lewis on the success of U.S.-Panama 
consultations to establish standard operating procedures to 
implement Salas-Becker (reftel).  Lewis was shocked that his 
MFA-led GOP interagency team expressed willingness to 
consider deployment of U.S. Navy gray hull ships in 
Panamanian waters under Salas-Becker, regardless of whether 
or not U.S. Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachments (LEDETs) 
were embarked aboard.  "We are not politically ready to 
consider gray hulls," Lewis stated, noting that his 
negotiating team had gone beyond its instructions.
