¶1. This is an action request.  USUN is requested to 
respond affirmatively by diplomatic note to a request by 
the United Nations (REF DFS-2008-285) to a two year 
extension of: 
 
-- an Agreement between the United States of America and 
the United Nations Organization Concerning the Provision 
of Services and Commodities on a Reimbursable Basis in 
Support of the Operations of the United Nations Assistance 
Mission in Iraq (the "607 Agreement"), first signed in New 
York on December 29, 2004, and 
 
-- the Implementing Arrangement between the Department of 
Defense on the United States of America and the United 
Nations Organization Concerning the Provision of Services 
and Commodities on a Reimbursable Basis in Support of the 
Operations of the United Nations Assistance Mission in 
Iraq, first signed at Kuwait on July 18, 2005. 
 
Both agreements were renewed on December 29, 2006, and are 
due to expire on December 31, 2008.  The extension would 
continue both the 607 Agreement and the Implementing 
Arrangement through December 31, 2010.  Moreover, USUN is 
requested to propose via diplomatic note an additional one 
year extension of the 607 Agreement and Implementing 
Arrangement through December 31, 2011. 
 
¶2. USUN is further requested to, through either the US 
Permanent Representative to the UN or US Deputy Permanent 
Representative to the UN, sign an Agreement between the 
United States and the United Nations Organization 
Concerning the Establishment of Security for the United 
Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq, based on a similar 
agreement, signed at New York on December 8, 2005, by then 
US Permanent Representative John Bolton and Special 
Representative of the UN Secretary General Ibrahim 
Gambari, which terminates at the end of the UN mandate for 
the Multinational Force in Iraq, on December 31, 2008.
