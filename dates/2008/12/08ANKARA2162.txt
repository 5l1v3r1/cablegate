¶2. Completed Actions for the Reporting Period: 
 
¶A. Meetings During Recent Reporting Period by EXBS Advisor 
and Coordinator: 
 
1) Nov 5 - EXBS Advisor Cieslinski met with MFA Department 
Head for Nonproliferation and Disarmament Elif Ulgen to 
discuss interagency reaction to the EXBS and nonproliferation 
seminar which was held in September.  Ulgun noted that the 
interagency was very satisfied with the seminar as a whole 
and that each Turkish agency believed meeting their US 
counterparts and hearing about U.S. nonproliferation programs 
was very useful.  Ulgen said the interagency would still need 
to meet several times further before MFA could provide their 
combined recommendations and requests for future engagement 
with the USG under the Nonproliferation Agreement. 
 
2) Nov 10 - EXBS Advisor attended a forum for the Stockholm 
International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) on Dual Use 
procedures at the Middle East Technical University where MFA 
and Undersecretariate of Foreign Trade (UFT) officials 
provided EU participants with an overview of Turkey's Export 
Control processes.  Both UFT and MFA provided the same 
presentations that were given at the EXBS Nonproliferation 
Seminar. 
 
3) Nov 12 - EXBS Coordinator and Turkish Customs Enforcement 
delegation departed Turkey for Washington DC. The Turkish 
delegation consisted of Mr. Neset AKKOC, Director General of 
Customs Enforcement; Mr. Ali BAYRAKDAROGLU, Advisor to State 
Minister and Deputy Prime Minister for Turkish Customs; Mr. 
Eyup GONULTAS, Chief of Customs Enforcement Controller; Mr. 
Mehmet AKILLI, Head of Anti Smuggling and Narcotics 
Department; and Mr. Abdullah SOYLU, Head of Personnel 
Department.  Delegation was met in Washington by Mr. Kevin 
Cummings (TDY EXBS Advisor) and Ms. Teresa Bailey (DHS/CBP 
Program manager for Turkey) who accompanied the delegation to 
all U.S. locations. 
 
4) Nov 13 - Delegation met with Mr. William Tobey, Deputy 
Administrator for Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation and his 
staff at DOE/NNSA. Mr. Tobey presented his colleagues to the 
delegation and gave a short briefing about NNSA organization 
and current program objectives of cooperation from the SLD 
program.  Mr. Akkoc thanked Tobey for the SLD program 
offerings for Turkey, but added that he was not the decision 
maker on this program and they would discuss the issue 
together with MFA and TAEK internally and inform Embassy 
Ankara of any decision reached for further cooperation. 
 
The delegation departed DOE for DHS/CBP where they met with 
Mr. Allen Gina, U.S. Customs and Border Protection Deputy 
Assistant Commissioner for the Office of Intelligence and 
Operations Coordination (OIOC).  Mr. Gina provided a brief 
overview of the CBP organization, planned delegation 
itinerary, and reviewed limitations on CBP acquired "mobile" 
equipment which failed to meet CBP's requirements. 
 
Delegation visited the National Targeting Center (NTC) in 
Reston, Virginia and met with the NTC representatives. They 
were briefed on the NTC operations in detail and then taken 
to NTC operation "nerve" center. The delegation was told that 
there were officers and analysts available 7/24 to respond to 
any RIID alarms all around the country. NTC representatives 
demonstrated the personal radiation detection pagers, RII 
devices and the software they used at the center. NTC 
 
representatives briefed the delegation about the operations 
in the port of Kasim in Pakistan, and showed the delegation 
how they used cameras and x-ray machines remotely to monitor 
container inspections. The delegation was satisfied with the 
NTC visit and they discussed how to setup such a targeting 
center for both passengers and cargo in Turkey that would 
include officials from TAEK and Ministry of Interior 
organizations. 
 
5) Nov 14 - The Delegation visited CBP's Advanced Training 
Center in Harper,s Ferry in West Virginia. A detailed 
briefing was presented by Director Jim Cobb about the 
facility and their future expansion projects.  The delegation 
visited tactical facilities and expressed an interest in 
acquiring training materials for physical training (training 
items such as batons, knifes, guns, etc).  The delegation 
also expressed an interest in sending some of their officers 
to this facility for advanced training.  No commitments where 
made. 
 
6)  Nov 16 - The delegation departed Washington DC and 
arrived Jacksonville Airport in Georgia.  Transportation was 
provided by CBP from airport to Brunswick to visit Federal 
Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC). 
 
7)  Nov 17 - The delegation arrived FLETC and received a 
comprehensive briefing about the facility by the Academy 
staff. They were very satisfied with the visit and noted it 
was good for them to see that different government law 
enforcement agencies receive their basic training in one 
centralized training center. They also visited a mock port of 
entry and saw the entrance process at land borders and 
airport arrivals. They expressed interest to send Turkish 
Customs Officers for basic training at FLETC as well.  The 
delegation departed FLETC in the afternoon for Charleston, 
South Carolina. 
 
8)  Nov 18 - The delegation visited the Customs Port of 
Charleston, SC and was welcomed by Ms. Joanne Fogg, Area Port 
Director.  She provided an overview of CBP,s layered 
enforcement strategy and seaport security efforts.  While 
there, the delegation visited the Wando Welch Terminal. Port 
authorities presented non-intrusive technologies (NII) and 
radiation portal monitors (RPM) that they use during their 
daily operations.  The delegation was very interested in the 
VACIS (Vehicle and Cargo Inspection System) demonstration. 
DG AKKOC expressed his interest for acquiring this type of 
equipment for Turkish Customs. The delegation also saw a 
demonstration of the radiation portal monitors used for 
detecting radioactive materials and how secondary inspections 
were carried out with hand held devices (i.e. RIIDs) and 
x-ray machines.  They also toured the unified cargo 
enforcement inspection (Customs Examination Station-CES) 
facilities situated separately from the port of entries. They 
were briefed about the agricultural products and intellectual 
property right (IPR) issues. The delegation found it useful 
to see a separate centralized secondary inspection facility 
for all inbound cargo inspected by specialized staff (e,g, 
agricultural officers, K-9 unit).  The delegation departed 
Charleston for San Diego. 
 
9)  Nov 19 - Delegation visited San Ysidro Port of Entry 
(POE)/Chula Vista Border Patrol Station. They were met by the 
port director and provided an overview of their daily 
operations.  The delegation was then provided an facility 
tour by border patrol agents and received briefings on border 
patrol operations between various border zones (zones 1-15) 
and saw both radiation portal monitors for passenger vehicles 
and the VACIS system for the railroad POE.  The delegation 
then visited the Chula Vista Border Patrol Station.  They 
received information about the ground sensors and alarm 
signals used to monitor remote border locations and were 
informed about the measures taken by the dispatchers 
concerning active alarms. They also visited the operations 
center and watched examples of previous operations and 
observed zooming and night vision capabilities of the 
regional cameras. 
 
10) Nov 21 - The delegation departed San Diego for New York. 
 
11) Nov 22 - The delegation visited CBP's JFK Cargo 
Operations Center.  Mr. Richard B. O,Connell, Assistant Area 
Director, and his colleagues briefed the delegation about 
airport cargo operations.  They visited K-9 facilities at the 
airport and warehouses for inbound cargo.  CBP officers 
demonstrated the use of detection equipment (Mobile x-ray 
machine, fiber-optic scope etc.) and briefed them on how CBP 
used this equipment during their daily operations on 
inspecting aircraft (both passenger and cargo).  The 
delegation was interested in obtaining the mobile van x-ray 
machines in order to use them during the summer time in busy 
international airports and sea ports in Turkey.  They also 
mentioned to use this mobile equipment in remote ports of 
entry in southern and eastern parts of Turkey. 
 
12) Nov 24 - The delegation departed the U.S. for Ankara. 
Overall, Turkish Customs Officials felt the visit was a 
complete success and DHS/CBP provided them with the required 
access and comprehensive overview of training and equipment 
which will allow GOT to enhance their Customs Enforcement 
practices and infrastructure in Turkey.  DG Akkoc also noted 
that he would like to have his Undersecretariate for Customs 
visit the U.S. in the coming year, as he believes this will 
assist them with the upcoming restructuring of Turkey's 
Border Management System, which is still in its early stages.
