SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK 
ON APPLICATION 050091259 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post's assistance in conducting 
a pre-license check on application 050091259 for the export 
of a KC-135 spare part to the French Air Force.  Post is 
requested to complete this Blue Lantern check within 30 days. 
 Lack of response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending 
and future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request:  Unfamiliar foreign consignee, Satori, 
present on Department's watchlist and never subject to prior 
Blue Lantern check. 
 
¶4. ACTION: Embassy is requested to make inquiries with 
appropriate Satori officials to determine if it has ordered 
the KC-135 spare part and that it will be used for the 
purpose stated on the license.  Department requests that 
Embassy conduct a site visit to Satori in order to provide an 
assessment of its business operations, on-site security, and 
general reliability as a recipient of United States Munitions 
List (USML) items.  POC at Satori is Karine Charlemagne, 
Purchasing Manager, TEL: 33-0-1-46-62-73-00; reference 
Purchase Order # N084247 dated Feb. 22, 2008.  The following 
questions are offered as suggested guidance with Satori: 
 
- Can Satori provide documentation from the French Air Force 
establishing it as the end user of item listed in paragraph 5 
below? 
 
- Who are Satori's main customers? 
 
- Does the company understand the restrictions on United 
States Munitions List (USML) articles, particularly regarding 
re-export and retransfer? 
 
 
If a site visit is not possible, please inform PM/DTCC case 
officer.   End action.
