SUBJECT: AL BASHIR ENDORSES BETTER RELATIONS WITH U.S., BLAMES CHAD 
FOR UNFULFILLED PEACE AGREEMENTS 
 
 
¶1.  (U) SUMMARY: President Omar Al Bashir told reporters March 11 
that Sudan needs better relations with the United States.  In his 
remarks, he also criticized Chad, saying the country had not 
respected peace agreements with Sudan and that yet another peace 
agreement, negotiated by Senegal President Wade, is unlikely to 
achieve anything new.  Al Bashir spoke at a news Conference in Dubai 
at the end of his March 9-11 visit to the United Arab Emirates.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
BETTER RELATIONS WITH U.S. NEEDED 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) Commenting on U.S.-Sudan relations, Al Bashir said the 
United States is influential on all issues, so it is not in Sudan's 
interests to be hostile to it.  He said dialogue with Washington 
requires time and patience.  He went on to criticize the USG, 
alleging it had broken past commitments on resolving bilateral 
differences after the signing of the 2005 Comprehensive Peace 
Agreement. 
 
¶3.  (U) In a separate interview with CNN, quoted in the Khartoum 
press, Sudan Foreign Minister Deng Alor said Sudan is pushing an 
initiative to normalize relations with the United States.  He added 
that he had met in Addis Ababa with U.S. officials, including 
*Secretary* Rice, to this end.  Asked whether Sudan would make 
concessions to the U.S. on Darfur, Alor0u#f&ts unlikely to honor a new agreement in 
Dakar, he said.  Al Bashir was referring to a draft peace agreement 
negotiated by Senegal.  The GNU has yet to announce whether Al 
Bashir will sign the agreement March 12 while in Dakar for an 
Organization of the Islamic Conference summit.  Al Bashir added that 
"we want to confirm that we want peace.  We have no claims on Chad. 
Our country is big and we do not need extra territory." 
 
¶5.  (SBU) COMMENTS:  Al Bashir's comments to the local press, along 
with statements from other government officials, seek to convey that 
the President is serious about improving relations with the United 
States, and is well disposed towards S/E Williamson's proposals in 
particular. They were remarkably mild for a ruler who often makes 
incendiary off-the-cuff remarks.  As for his criticisms of Chad, 
these were met by most observers with a hearty laugh, as the same 
can obviously be said of Sudan - which has also failed to observe 
its bilateral peace agreements with Chad.
