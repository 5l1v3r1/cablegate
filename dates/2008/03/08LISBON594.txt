SUBJECT: PORTUGUESE VIEWS ON THE MARCH GAERC 
 
REF: SECSTATE 22352 
 
¶1. (SBU) Assistant EU Correspondent Pedro Severo de Almeida 
responded to the reftel points with Portugal's views in 
advance of March's GAERC meeting. He confirmed that the 
ministers planned to discuss the Balkans, Middle East Peace 
Process, Zimbabwe, Georgia, and Iran.  He also noted the 
possibility of a discussion on tensions between Colombia, 
Ecuador, and Venezuela under other business depending on the 
developments over the weekend of March 8-9. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Western Balkans: Almeida acknowledged that Balkans 
discussions could still be delicate given the split between 
nations who have recognized Kosovo and those who have not. 
He predicted that the conversation would focus on the mission 
in Bosnia and the future of Republika Srpska rather than 
Kosovo this month.  Almeida also stressed that he had no 
indication of when Portugal would recognize Kosovo. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Middle East: Portugal agrees that it is important to 
maintain the positive momentum from Annapolis despite the 
recent violence in Israel and Gaza.  Almeida noted that the 
EU remains concerned about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza 
and plans to ask that Israel have a more "proportionate 
response" to the attacks launched from Gaza. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Zimbabwe: The ministers will review draft 
conclusions on Zimbabwe, and may include language that offers 
to revise sanctions if the elections comply with 
international standards.  He added that the GOZ agreed to let 
accredited EU diplomats assigned to Zimbabwe serve as 
observers during the elections.  While Almeida recognized 
that it was highly unlikely that Zimbabwe would hold free and 
fair elections, the EU plans to offer the carrot of enhanced 
engagement to see whether it can prompt a positive reaction 
from Zimbabwean authorities. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Georgia: Almeida said he understood that South 
Ossetia was seeking Russian, EU, and UN support for its 
independence.  He predicted that the EU's discussion, which 
had been slated to discuss visas, free trade, and confidence 
building measures, would focus entirely on the independence 
question.  Almeida expressed concern that any new declaration 
of independence would encourage some to say that Kosovo was 
serving as a precedent. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Iran: In addition to sanctions discussions, Almeida 
stated that the meeting would cover the EU's concerns about 
Iran's new penal code, narcotics cultivation, terrorism, and 
human rights conditions.
