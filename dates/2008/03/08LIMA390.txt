SUBJECT: SUSPECTED "BOLIVARIAN" TERRORISTS DETAINED AT 
ECUADORAN BORDER 
 
¶1. (SBU) Agents of the Peruvian National Police (PNP) 
Anti-Terrorism Directorate (DIRCOTE) February 29 in the 
northern region of Tumbes arrested seven alleged members of 
the "Bolivarian Continental Coordinating Committee" 
(Coordinadora Nacional Bolivariana -- CNB), including the 
organization's president, according to media reports.  The 
seven reportedly were returning to Peru from Ecuador, where 
they had taken part in a CNB meeting in Quito.  PNP sources 
reported that the CNB was an umbrella organization, based in 
Venezuela, that sought to link "terrorist groups" with 
anti-systemic actors throughout the Andean region.  According 
to press reports, PNP officials said the seven were carrying 
CNB propaganda and suspected that the group intended to 
sabotage APEC events taking place in Peru this year.  The PNP 
also believed the seven may have had contact while in Quito 
with members of Colombia's FARC, and also that the CNB has 
links to the near defunct Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement 
(MRTA) in Peru. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Government officials, including Prime Minister 
Jorge del Castillo and Interior Minister Luis Alva Castro, 
have publicly claimed that Venezuela-funded ALBA houses and 
other "Bolivarian" groups are seeking to destabilize the GOP 
during a year in which Peru is in the international 
limelight.  Comment: The government views the security of its 
high-level international visitors as a top priority; the 
arrest of the seven suspected radicals underscores its 
willingness to preempt the threats in the early stages, as 
necessary.  End Comment.
