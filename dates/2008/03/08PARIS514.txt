¶1. SUMMARY:  France will seek to use its considerable influence on 
agricultural policy to affect the direction and pace of CAP reform 
as well as to broaden the consideration of biotech dossiers at the 
EU level. France's influence could have negative trade implications 
for U.S. agriculture in several critical areas. High level U.S. 
policy engagement with France on these issues well in advance of the 
July-December 2008 French presidency would help manage negative 
fallout. END SUMMARY 
 
¶2.  In a major speech last month, President Sarkozy emphasized that 
the 2008 CAP health check done under the French Presidency should 
lay the groundwork for a more complete and in-depth reform of the 
CAP in 2009, rather than wait for the 2010 budget discussions for 
implementation in 2013. One of his four stated goals for CAP reform 
is increased EU food security. He stressed that strict EU sanitary, 
environmental and welfare regulations should also apply without 
restrictions to imported products. Sarkozy also emphasized that EU 
Community preference should be the basis for a new CAP(REF A). 
 
¶3. Ag Minister Michel Barnier recently told a group of Embassy 
representatives that France will press for phytosanitary 
harmonization, which will result in the application of more rigorous 
standards to products imported into the EU.  Barnier also emphasized 
"Community preference," stating that it will become more difficult 
to export to the EU (but that France would offer technical 
assistance to countries in need). When questioned about the 
President's and Ag Minister's statements about Community preference, 
a high level MinAg official stated that in many sectors (e.g. 
livestock) Europe cannot open its borders too much, without 
destroying its domestic industry. 
 
¶4. Another area of concern is biotechnology, where France recently 
announced a moratorium on planting of MON 810 based on the findings 
of an interim High Authority on Biotechnology(REF B). In a departure 
from previous practice, MON 810 was reviewed not only by a 
scientific body, but also by a "civil society" body composed of 
laypeople.  It is clear that France will seek to export this model 
to Brussels.  In a recent statement before the Council of 
Environmental Ministers, the press reported that French Minister of 
Environment Jean Louis Borloo proposed scrapping the EU's present 
system for authorizing genetically modified crops for tougher 
standards which would take into account a wide range of 
environmental and safety factors.  Under the French proposal, a 
multi-disciplinary and independent assessment would be used to 
consider proposals for authorizing GMOs, rather giving sole advisory 
authority to the European Food Safety Agency.  Under the French plan 
food safety concerns would be considered alongside issues such as 
the farming economy, soil deterioration and effects on other crops. 
 
¶5. France plans to organize a European seminar on biotech and 
biodiversity in Paris next October to lay the groundwork for 
proposing such reforms to the EU biotech evaluation process. 
 
¶6. COMMENT:  Post will continue to raise U.S. concerns on these 
issues with our interlocutors.  However, it will be important to 
pass the message at the highest levels that decisions on 
biotechnology and SPS issues should be made on the basis of science 
and that the imposition of new trade barriers would be a step in the 
wrong direction. END COMMENT. 
 
7.More detailed commentary on France's agricultural initiatives will 
follow in the coming weeks.
