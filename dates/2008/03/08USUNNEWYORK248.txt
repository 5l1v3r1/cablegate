SUBJECT: UNHQ UPDATES ON UNAMI ISSUES 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: During a regularly scheduled trilateral 
with the U.S. and UK on March 13, the UN,s Iraq team 
provided updates on UNAMI,s revised proposal for a long-term 
compound, a request for MNF-I protection during construction 
of support facilities for UNAMI at the Baghdad International 
airport (BIAP), progress on acquiring a civilian aircraft 
dedicated to UNAMI, and an anticipated increase in the number 
of UNAMI military advisors to match the expansion of UNAMI 
activities.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Julian Davis, the UN,s deputy team leader on Iraq, 
told USUN and UKUN that the Department of Political Affairs 
recently received UNAMI,s official report regarding the 
revised proposal for a long-term compound in Baghdad sited 
near the New Embassy Compound, including an estimated new 
cost revised downward to US$98 million.  SRSG de Mistura 
plans to address the UN,s budgeting committee, the ACABQ, in 
order to personally lobby for the compound.  Next steps in 
planning for the compound include: 1) receiving a formal 
allocation of the site from the Iraqi government; 2) 
procuring a lien from the Iraqi government for 25 years; and 
3) receiving a more specific commitment from the Iraqi 
government regarding the GOI's pledge to help pay for a 
portion of the compound,s construction. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Davis also outlined UNAMI,s plans to begin 
construction for support facilities at BIAP, given the 
increase in UNAMI staff and the expected arrival of a 
dedicated civilian aircraft.  UNAMI has chosen a contractor 
for the construction, which is expected to last 100 days. 
UNAMI asked its Georgian security contingent to provide 
security during construction activities, but the Georgians 
apparently refused.  Davis said UNAMI has raised this issue 
with MNF-I, and has requested MNF-I support if the Georgians 
continue to refuse. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Davis said UNAMI urgently needed to begin 
construction given that there is progress in the UN,s 
long-standing efforts to procure a dedicated civilian 
aircraft equipped with electronic counter-measures.  The UN 
has solicited bids on the project, and hopes to have an 
aircraft in operation by May 1.  Davis also noted that UNAMI 
intends to raise the number of military advisors from 5 to 
17, to take into account increased UNAMI activities 
throughout the country.
