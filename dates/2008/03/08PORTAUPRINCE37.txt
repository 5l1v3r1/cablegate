they were in the Doinican Republic.  (Note:  GARR correctly 
noted tat the GOH's fight against corruption must include 
the land borders because corrpt officials on both sides of 
the Haitian-Dominican border are implicated, either turning a 
blind eye to illegal border crossings or profiting directly 
from such crossings.  End note.) 
 
¶7. (SBU) PREVAL WANTS FASTER PROGRESS ON FINANCIAL CRIMES 
PROSECUTIONS 
 
President Preval called for a briefing February 22 by 
Department of Treasury Office of Technical Assistance 
advisors.  The President asked OTA advisors to outline 
impediments in the identification and prosecution of 
financial crimes cases and said clear and measurable progress 
is essential to respond to public concerns about corruption. 
Preval pressured Minister of Justice Magloire to equip 
offices of the judicial police investigators (BAFE offices), 
ensure appropriate salaries were offered to BAFE 
investigators, and immediately identify prosecutors and 
magistrates with financial expertise who can swiftly act on 
cases.  OTA advisors returned March 2 and plan to work 
intensively with BAFE in the review of suspicious cases. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) CONTROVERSY CONTINUES AT FINANCIAL INTELLIGENCE UNIT 
 
Former investigating judge Jean Ostrict Hercules was named 
February 29 to replace Central Financial Information Unit 
(UCREF) Director Jean-Yves Noel.  Some media reports 
criticized Hercules for not doing enough as a sitting judge 
to ensure prosecutions in the murder of Radio Haiti 
journalist Jean Dominique and bodyguard Jean Claude 
Louissaint in 2000.  Hercules allegedly cited personal 
security concerns to justify his decision to return the cases 
to the Civil Court.  Noel, whose term recently expired, made 
the list of candidates, but was not recommended for selection 
by the National Committee against Money Laundering (CNLBA) 
due to questions about management and operational 
transparency.  Noel has also been accused of blocking the 
transfer of suspect financial crimes cases to the 
investigating arm of the police -- BAFE.  (Note:  Minister of 
Justice Rene Magloire swore in Hercules at UCREF offices 
March 3.  End note.) 
 
¶9. (U) GOH PREPARES FOR APRIL INTERNATIONAL DONOR CONFERENCE 
 
Prime Minister Alexis presided over a meeting with donor 
country representatives February 26 to discuss preparations 
for a donor conference to be held April 25 in Port-au-Prince. 
 The GoH plans to reach an agreement with key donors on 
financing the medium-term Growth and Poverty Reduction 
Strategy (GPRSP) devised by the GoH in November. 
Approximately USD 4 billion will be required over a 
three-year period to implement the GPRSP.  GoH interlocutors 
note the GPRSP is primed for success due to broad 
participation by the Haitian public and civil society, as 
well as consultations with the donor community.  A conference 
secretariat, headed by former Minister of Planning and 
External Cooperation Anthony Dessources, has been established 
to organize the April conference. 
 
¶10.  (U) COMMISSION ON SECURITY PROMOTES HAITIAN MILITARY 
 
On February 19, poloffs met with journalist/historian Georges 
Michel, member of the Presidential Commission for Reflection 
on the Reinforcement of Security, a think-tank organized to 
explore the feasibility of reinstituting a national army in 
Haiti.  Michel said the Commission supports the 
reconstitution of a small national army of about 3,000 
troops, underscoring that the army would specialize in 
defensive warfare only.  The HNP, not the army, would remain 
the first line in the defense of civilians, to avoid the 
military's past abuse of authority against civilians.  The 
commission's final report will be released in October, and 
will be made available to the public. 
 
¶11.  (U) GOH PROPOSES TO INCREASE DAILY MINIMUM WAGE 
 
The GOH on February 28 announced that it wanted to increase
