SUBJECT: BSEC SEEKS ADDITIONAL U.S. COOPERATION ON 
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 
 
REF: ISTANBUL 854 
 
 ¶1. (SBU)  Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC) 
Environmental Working Group representatives greatly 
appreciated U.S. support of the  September 2007 
BSEC Environmental Symposium (reftel) and requested 
the U.S. government sponsor similar symposiums to be 
held in tandem with future BSEC Environmental Working 
Group meetings.   At a Working Group meeting in 
Istanbul on March 18, the Turkish representative 
stated that the September 2007 Symposium made the 
BSEC Environmental Working Group meeting, which was 
held imediatitly before the Symosium, the most 
successful ever.  The rich content provided by 
the U.S. delegation headed by EUR DAS Colleen Graffy 
contributed substance to the BSEC representatives who 
would otherwise generally only debate administrative 
issues. Moreover, the BSEC representatives appreciated 
the follow-up DVD created by the Consulate's Public 
Affairs Office. The March BSEC Environmental Working 
added to their agenda that future meetings should be 
held "back-to-back with BSEC-US Environmental Symposiums". 
The U.S. observer to the BSEC Environmental Working noted 
the U.S. would like to continue such cooperation, but 
needed to report back to the working group regarding 
what level of sponsorship that the U.S. could provide. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Comment:  U.S. support for such a future 
Symposium would maintain the momentum created last 
September.  All the BSEC representatives were positive 
about USG involvement, including the Russian 
representative who chaired one of the sessions.  The BSEC 
Permanent International Secretariat (PERMIS) in Istanbul 
has the capacity to co-host a symposium of about 50 
attendees, yet lacks the funds needed to support travel for 
attendees.  The two-day September conference cost involved 
approximately $40,000 in USG support.  Mission Turkey 
stands ready to assist future BSEC-U.S. conferences; 
however Washington would need to fully fund these events.
