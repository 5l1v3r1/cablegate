SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) REPRESENTATIVES FROM RUSSIA, CHINA, JAPAN, INDIA, 
AND AUSTRALIA PRESENTED UPDATES ON DEPLOYMENT OF GLOBAL 
NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEMS (GNSS) AT THE 6TH ANNUAL MUNICH 
SATELLITE AND NAVIGATION SUMMIT HELD FEBRUARY 19-21, 2008. 
WITHIN THE NEXT TWO YEARS, RUSSIA'S GLONASS PROGRAM IS 
PROJECTED TO REACH FULL OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY (FOC) AND 
CHINA'S COMPASS PROGRAM AIMS TO ACHIEVE COMPLETE REGIONAL 
COVERAGE.  JAPAN AND INDIA CONTINUE TO DEVELOP REGIONAL 
SYSTEMS.  WHILE INDIA DESIRES A PARTNERSHIP WITH GLONASS, 
JAPAN IS FORMING A PARTNERSHIP WITH GPS AND POSSIBLY 
INTERESTED IN A FUTURE PARTNERSHIP WITH GALILEO.  AUSTRALIA 
EXPRESSED NO INTEREST IN DEVELOPING AN INDIGENOUS GNSS AND IS 
FOCUSING INSTEAD ON DEVELOPMENT OF GNSS DATA END-USER 
APPLICATIONS AND MULTI-GNSS RECEIVER TECHNOLOGY.  END SUMMARY.

RUSSIA: GLONASS UPDATE 
---------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) SERGEY REVNIVYKH, DIRECTOR OF THE SATELLITE 
NAVIGATION DEPARTMENT IN THE RUSSIAN FEDERAL SPACE AGENCY'S 
MISSION CONTROL CENTER, PROVIDED AN UPDATE ON THE GLONASS 
PROGRAM.  HE EMPHASIZED THAT GLONASS IS ON SCHEDULE TO ATTAIN 
A COMPLETE CONSTELLATION OF 24 SATELLITES (GLONASS-M) BY THE 
END OF 2009 AND HAS RECEIVED FUNDING FOR A PROGRAM EXTENSION 
TO 2020. 
 
LAUNCH UPDATES 
 
¶3.  (U) REVNIVYKH STATED THAT THERE ARE CURRENTLY 16 
SATELLITES IN THE CONSTELLATION (THREE GLONASS AND 13 
GLONASS-M, OF WHICH 14 ARE HEALTHY) WITH PLANS TO LAUNCH SIX 
MORE GLONASS-M SATELLITES THIS YEAR.  THIS YEAR'S LAUNCHES 
WILL CONSIST OF TWO BLOCKS OF THREE GLONASS-M SATELLITES 
EACH.  THE FIRST, BLOCK 38, IS SCHEDULED TO OCCUR IN 
SEPTEMBER.  BLOCK 39 IS SCHEDULED TO LAUNCH IN NOVEMBER.  BY 
YEAR'S END, REVNIVYKH EXPECTS 18 HEALTHY 
GLONASS-M SATELLITES WILL BE IN GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT. 
 
GLONASS GOALS 
 
¶4.  (SBU) REVNIVYKH STRESSED THE DUAL PURPOSE OF GLONASS ON 
THE PROVIDER LEVEL:  TO PROTECT NATIONAL SECURITY AND TO 
PROMOTE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.  HE ADDED THAT GLONASS WILL BE 
FREE OF CHARGE AND THAT RUSSIA ENCOURAGES USE-COOPERATION OF 
GLONASS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON THE 
MIDDLE EAST, AUSTRALIA, AND LATIN AMERICA. 
 
GLONASS MODERNIZATION 
 
¶5.  (SBU) REVNIVYKH HIGHLIGHTED KEY ASPECTS OF GLONASS 
MODERNIZATION, CITING BETTER POSITIONAL ACCURACY, TIME 
REFERENCE ACCURACY, AND COMPATIBILITY AND INTEROPERABILITY 
(C&I).  THE KEY COMPONENTS OF GLONASS MODERNIZATION ARE 
SIGNAL MODERNIZATION AND THE USE OF FREQUENCY DIVISION 
MULTIPLE ACCESS (FDMA) AND CODE DIVISION MULTIPLE ACCESS 
(CDMA) SIGNAL TECHNOLOGY.  IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION 
REGARDING WHICH SPECIFIC SIGNALS WILL BE USED WITH CDMA, 
REVNIVYKH STATED THAT SUCH INFORMATION WOULD BE DISCUSSED AT 
THE INTERNATIONAL SATELLITE NAVIGATION FORUM IN MOSCOW, 
RUSSIA ON APRIL 7-8, 2008. 
 
POSSIBLE GLONASS COOPERATION WITH INDIA 
 
¶6.  (SBU) AS PART OF RUSSIA'S AGGRESSIVE PLAN TO ACHIEVE FOC 
BY THE END OF YEAR 2009, REVNIVYKH SAID, RUSSIA IS 
CONSIDERING THE USE OF INDIAN ROCKETS FOR GLONASS-M 
DEPLOYMENTS. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
CHINA: COMPASS (BEIDOU-2) AND GALILEO COOPERATION 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) DR. JING GUIFEI, HEAD OF THE NAVIGATION DIVISION OF 
THE NATIONAL REMOTE SENSING CENTER CHINA (NRSCC), PRESENTED 
AN UPDATE ON THE CHINESE COMPASS GNSS PROGRAM.  GUIFEI STATED 
THAT THE COMPASS GOAL IS TO ACHIEVE A COMPLETE GLOBAL 
CONSTELLATION OF 35 BEIDOU-2 SATELLITES (30 IN MEDIUM EARTH 
 
ORBIT (MEO) AND 5 IN GEO-STATIONARY ORBIT).  GUIFEI ADDED 
THAT THE COMPASS REGIONAL PROGRAM IS FULLY FUNDED AND THE 
GLOBAL PROGRAM FUNDING IS STILL "UNDER DISCUSSION." 
 
SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT 
 
¶8.  (SBU) GUIFEI BROKE DOWN THE BEIDOU-2 PROGRAM SYSTEM 
DEVELOPMENT INTO TWO STEPS.  THE FIRST STEP IS AIMED AT 
COMPLETING REGIONAL SERVICES (RELATED TO THE FIVE MEO 
SATELLITES).  THE SECOND WILL FOCUS ON COVERING ASIA "MAYBE 
BY THE END OF 2009" AND BEYOND THAT COMPLETE GLOBAL COVERAGE. 
 GUIFEI PRESENTED NO SPECIFIC INFORMATION REGARDING TIMELINES 
OF COMPASS PROGRAMMATIC MILESTONES.  GUIFEI SAID THAT COMPASS 
WILL PROVIDE TWO SERVICES, AN OPEN SERVICE FREE TO THE PUBLIC 
AND AN AUTHORIZED SERVICE FOR USE BY THE CHINESE MILITARY. 
GUIFEI EXPLAINED FURTHER THAT THE OPEN SERVICE WILL HAVE A 
POSITION ACCURACY OF LESS THAN 20 METERS, A VELOCITY ACCURACY 
OF 0.2 METERS PER SECOND AND A TIME ACCURACY OF 50 
NANOSECONDS.  GUIFEI EMPHASIZED THE AUTHORIZED SERVICE IS 
DESIGNED TO BE AVAILABLE IN "COMPLEX SITUATIONS," I.E., 
MILITARY SITUATIONS.  GUIFEI ADDED THAT THE AUTHORIZED 
SERVICE WILL HAVE AN ENHANCED POSITIONAL ACCURACY OF LESS 
THAN 1 METER. 
 
LATEST SATELLITE LAUNCH TO SECURE FREQUENCY FILLINGS 
 
¶9.  (U) GUIFEI SAID THE MOST RECENT COMPASS GEO-STATIONARY 
MEO SATELLITE (LAUNCHED IN APRIL 2007) IS THE COMPASS 
PROGRAM'S NEWEST SATELLITE.  HE ADDED THAT THE INTENDED USE 
OF THIS GEO-STATIONARY SATELLITE IS FOR IN-ORBIT-VALIDATION 
(IOV) AND TO SECURE FREQUENCY FILLINGS.  GUIFEI SAID THE 
TECHNOLOGY ON THIS SATELLITE IS ABLE TO ACHIEVE A POSITIONAL 
ACCURACY OF LESS THAN 10 METERS. 
 
FREQUENCY PLAN 
 
¶10.  (SBU) GUIFEI SHOWED A CHART LISTING FOUR COMPASS CARRIER 
FREQUENCIES (SHOWN BELOW).  THE CHART DISPLAYED A FREQUENCY 
DOMAIN DIAGRAM INCLUDING GPS, GLONASS, AND GALILEO FREQUENCY 
SPECTRUMS.  THE CHART SHOWED A STRIKING OVERLAP BETWEEN 
COMPASS AND GALILEO FREQUENCIES.  WHEN  ASKED HOW EXACTLY 
CHINA INTENDS TO ASSURE FREQUENCY COMPATIBILITY WITH OTHER 
GNSS, GUIFEI GAVE A VERY SHORT RESPONSE SAYING ONLY THAT THIS 
IS A "BIG ISSUE" THAT IS STILL "UNDER DISCUSSION.". 
 
-- B1:   1561.098  2.046 MHZ 
-- B1-2: 1589.742  12 MHZ 
-- B1:   1207.140  12 MHZ 
-- B1:   1268.520  12 MHZ 
 
CHINA DESIRES TO STAY ACTIVE WITH GALILEO RESEARCH AND 
DEVELOPMENT 
 
¶11.  (SBU) YIN JUN, DEPUTY DIRECTOR GENERAL OF HIGH AND NEW 
TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT AND INDUSTRIAL DEPARTMENT WITHIN THE 
CHINESE MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (MOST), GAVE A 
PRESENTATION ON CHINA'S COOPERATION WITH GALILEO.  SINCE 
2003, JUN SAID, CHINA HAS INVESTED 70 MILLION EURO FOR 
GALILEO IOV AND 35 MILLION EURO TO SUPPORT GALILEO 
APPLICATIONS.  HE MENTIONED "NUMEROUS OTHER CONTRACTS" THE 
CHINESE HAVE SIGNED TO SUPPORT GALILEO RESEARCH AND 
DEVELOPMENT.  ALTHOUGH CHINA IS COMMITTED TO DEVELOPING ITS 
OWN INDEPENDENT GNSS, JUN POINTED OUT, CHINA IS -- AND HAS 
LONG BEEN -- SUPPORTIVE OF THE GALILEO CONSTRUCTION THROUGH 
FOC AND WOULD LIKE TO REMAIN INVOLVED POST 2013.  ASKED ABOUT 
FREQUENCY OVERLAY ISSUES WITH COMPASS AND GALILEO, JUN 
RESPONDED THAT CHINA IS STILL TRYING TO RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM 
WITHIN CHINA-EU WORKING GROUPS AND EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE THAT 
FURTHER DISCUSSIONS WOULD LEAD TO A RESOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM.

JAPAN: QZSS UPDATE 
------------------ 
 
¶12.  (U) SATOSHI KOGURE, AN ASSOCIATE ENGINEER AT THE JAPAN 
AEROSPACE EXPLORATION AGENCY (JAXA), PRESENTED AN UPDATE OF 
JAPAN'S REGIONAL QUASI ZENITH SATELLITE SYSTEM (QZSS), A 
THREE SATELLITE REGIONAL TIME TRANSFER SYSTEM DESIGNED TO 
AUGMENT GPS COVERAGE OVER JAPAN.  THESE SATELLITES WILL BE 
PLACED IN A PERIODIC HIGHLY ELLIPTICAL ORBIT (HEO) TO ALLOW 
FOR LONG DWELL TIME OVER THEIR INTENDED REGIONAL AREA OF 
COVERAGE. 
 
FREQUENCY PLAN 
 
¶13.  (U) KOGURE LISTED THE FREQUENCY PLAN FOR QZSS AS 
 
FOLLOWS: 
 
-- L1-C/A:    1575.42 MHZ 
-- L1C:       1575.42 MHZ 
-- L2C:       1227.6 MHZ 
-- L5:        1176.45 MHZ 
-- L1-SAIF:   1575.42 MHZ 
-- LEX:       1278.75 MHZ 
     NOTE: LEX IS A HIGH DATA RATE EXPERIMENTAL SIGNAL 
COMPATIBLE 
     WITH GALILEO E6 
 
PERFORMANCE AND COVERAGE 
 
¶14.  (U) KOGURE STATED THAT QZSS WILL UTILIZE DATA FROM THE 
REGIONAL QZSS AND 23 GPS SATELLITES AND PROVIDE TWO COVERAGE 
ZONES (A AND B).  ZONE A WILL COVER JAPAN AND AUSTRALIA, 
WHILE ZONE B WILL COVER NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA.  KOGURE 
STATED THAT QZSS IS EXPECTED TO ACHIEVE POSITIONAL ACCURACY 
OF LESS THAN 1.6 METERS FOR 95 PERCENT OF THE COVERAGE AREAS. 
 
COMPATIBILITY AND INTEROPERABILITY 
 
¶15.  (SBU) KOGURE STATED THAT ALTHOUGH QZSS ENJOYS A VERY 
CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH GPS IN REGARDS TO C&I, JAPAN IS ALSO 
COORDINATING C&I WITH GALILEO AND HOPES TO DO THE SAME WITH 
COMPASS.  (NOTE:  NO MENTION WAS MADE OF C&I COORDINATION 
WITH GLONASS.  END NOTE) 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
INDIA: DEVELOPING REGIONAL GNSS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH GLONASS 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
¶16.  (SBU) ALTHOUGH INDIAN PARTICIPANTS DID NOT MAKE A 
PRESENTATION, BAL KRISHNA, THE EDITOR OF "COORDINATES", A NEW 
DELHI BASED MAGAZINE ON POSITIONING NAVIGATION, TOLD GLOBAL 
AFFAIRS OFFICER THAT INDIA IS CURRENTLY DEVELOPING A REGIONAL 
SYSTEM IN PARTNERSHIP WITH GLONASS.  KRISHNA EXPLAINED THAT 
THE DRIVING FORCE FOR INDIA IS TO ATTAIN GNSS INDEPENDENCE, 
WHICH IS ALSO WHY SO MANY COUNTRIES ARE DEVELOPING THEIR OWN 
GNSS.  KRISHNA MENTIONED THAT THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN INDIA 
AND GLONASS IS NOT ABOUT ACQUIRING TECHNOLOGY FROM RUSSIA, 
BUT ABOUT HELPING THE RUSSIANS SPEED UP GLONASS DEPLOYMENT 
AND FACILITATING INDIAN ACCESS TO GLONASS.  (NOTE:  KRISHNA 
STRONGLY HINTED THAT THIS MEANS ACCESS TO THE GLONASS 
MILITARY SIGNAL.  END NOTE).  KRISHNA STATED THAT FOR NOW 
INDIA IS FOCUSED ON A REGIONAL SYSTEM, BUT THE FUTURE GOAL IS 
TO DEVELOP A GLOBAL SYSTEM. 
 
ORIGINALLY INDIA DESIRED A PARTNERSHIP WITH GALILEO 
 
¶17.  (SBU) KRISHNA STATED THAT INDIA MOVED AWAY FROM ITS 
ORIGINAL PARTNERSHIP WITH GALILEO BECAUSE OF DELAYS 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE GALILEO PROGRAM.  GLONASS, HE ADDED, IS 
SIMPLY A MORE REALISTIC OPTION FOR MEETING INDIA'S GNSS NEEDS. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
AUSTRALIA: NO AMBITIONS TO DEVELOP AN INDIGENOUS GNSS 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶18.  (U) CHRIS RIZOS, THE HEAD OF THE SCHOOL OF SURVEYING AND 
SPATIAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW SOUTH 
WALES (UNSW), AND MATT HIGGINS, A PRINCIPLE SURVEY ADVISOR 
WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES AND WATER IN 
QUEENSLAND AUSTRALIA DELIVERED PRESENTATIONS FOCUSED ON THE 
APPLICATION OF GNSS DATA TO AID AUSTRALIAN INFRASTRUCTURE 
PROJECTS.  RIZOS, WHO EMPHASIZED THAT HE IS NOT SPEAKING ON 
BEHALF OF THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT, SAID THE UNSW AIMS TO 
FOCUS ITS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ON DEVELOPING 
MULTI-CONSTELLATION GNSS RECEIVER TECHNOLOGY. 
 
AUSTRALIA IS WELL POSITIONED FOR VISIBILITY TO WORLDWIDE GNSS 
DATA 
 
¶19.  (U) RIZOS SAID AUSTRALIA IS WELL-POSITIONED DUE TO ITS 
VISIBILITY TO ALL CURRENT GLOBAL SATELLITE NAVIGATION SYSTEMS 
AND TO DEVELOPING REGIONAL SYSTEMS IN INDIA AND JAPAN.  HE 
ADDED AUSTRALIA WOULD LIKELY NOT HAVE AN INTEREST IN 
DEVELOPING EVEN A REGIONAL SYSTEM DUE THE REQUIRED FINANCIAL 
INVESTMENT THAT WOULD NEED TO BE SHOULDERED OVER A RELATIVELY 
SMALL TAX BASE.  RIZOS SUMMARIZED AUSTRALIA IS SIMPLY FOCUSED 
ON BUILDING INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION WITH OTHER GNSS 
PROVIDERS, EXPLORING NEW GNSS DATA AIDED INFRASTRUCTURE 
APPLICATIONS AND DEVELOPING GNSS RECEIVER TECHNOLOGY.
