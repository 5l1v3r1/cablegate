REF: STATE 25587 
 
(SBU) Czech MFA Department of the Middle East Iran Desk 
officer, Hana Jelinkova, indicated that the Czechs share our 
concerns about the electoral process in Iran, particularly 
with respect to the preparatory phase.  Jelinkova indicated 
that there is a draft EU statement being circulated by the 
UK, which addresses the issues of Iran's failure to meet 
international standards, the disqualification of candidates, 
the restrictions on the freedom of press and the lack of 
independent election monitors.  According to Jelinkova, the 
Czechs will support an EU statement on Iranian parliamentary 
elections that flags these concerns.  She indicated that this 
is expected to be released by the EU shortly after the March 
14 parliamentary elections.
