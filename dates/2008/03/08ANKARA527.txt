¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  Turkstat, the Turkish statistical agency, 
released a long-awaited GDP revision on March 8, increasing 
Turkey's 2006 GDP by 31.6%, and making upward revisions to 
all Turkish GDP calculations since 1998.  Final 2007 GDP 
figures will be released on March 31, and the upward revision 
is estimated at 39.4%.  The revision expands the size of the 
private sector by including modern sectors like internet 
services and leasing, as well as capturing more of the shadow 
economy through better methodology.  With this revision, 
Turkey's 2007 GDP per capita is estimated to be USD 9,663, 
and it is expected to exceed USD 10,000 in 2008 (aided by a 
4.5% reduction in Turkey's population from recent household 
survey).  Turkey's 2007 debt-to-GDP ratio will fall from 
39.4% to 29.5%, and its Current Account Deficit "shrinks" 
from 8.0% of GDP to 6.1%.  The revision gives a more accurate 
picture of the Turkish economy, but it does not change any of 
Turkey's economic fundamentals nor the negative trend.  It is 
not expected to result in a bond ratings upgrade, despite 
Minister Simsek's call for an upgrade in a March 12 press 
conference.  The revision does, however, make Turkey's 
economy look comparatively more stable and prosperous than 
other emerging markets, which will be to Turkey's advantage 
as it competes to attract foreign investment and tries to 
make itself an attractive EU accession candidate.  End 
summary. 
 
What Has Changed 
----------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) Turkstat released its GDP revisions on March 8.  The 
new data revises GDP calculations from 1998 to 2006, with 
revised 2007 data scheduled to be released on March 31. 
Analysts had expected an upward revision of 2006 GDP of 
between 5 and 40%, so the 31.6% revision came at the upper 
end of expectations.  Turkstat has been working on this 
revision for nearly four years, in cooperation with Eurostat. 
 This is Turkey's first GDP revision since 1990, and updates 
its statistical methodology from the 1968 OECD System of 
National Accounts method to the 1995 European System of 
Accounts (ESA 95) method.  The base year has moved up from 
1987 to 1998. 
 
¶3. (U)  The large GDP increase is the result of expanding 
data coverage to include new sectors (e.g., internet 
services, leasing, private pension funds) and more of the 
shadow economy (particularly notable in manufacturing and 
construction), and using better statistical methodology and 
more recent survey data.  The number of homes, for example, 
was revised up 38.1%, and the number of manufacturing 
businesses went up 146.3% (even as manufacturing's share of 
the economy dropped from 30% to 26%).

¶4. (SBU) The jump in 2006 GDP per capita is 36% because the 
new series reflects not only the GDP increase but also the 
4.5% population reduction that Turkstat announced in late 
February, from 73.9 million to 70.3 million, as a result of 
2007 census and better methodology.  It pushes Turkey up to 
into the "high middle income" class of countries by World 
Bank and European Union standards.  Turkey looks 
comparatively much stronger economically.  The estimated USD 
9,663 GDP per capita figure for 2007 puts Turkey ahead of 
 
ANKARA 00000527  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
emerging economic powers Brazil and Russia, and also ahead of 
recent EU entrants Bulgaria and Romania, on a per capita 
basis. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Turkey's financial ratios generally look better 
following the revision, although the primary fiscal surplus 
for both 2006 and 2007 now appears to have been well below 
the IMF's 6.5% target:

What Has Not Changed 
---------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU)  In a March 12 press conference, Treasury Minister 
Simsek complained that rating agencies should give Turkey a 
ratings upgrade as a result of the GDP revision.  While it is 
true that many of Turkey's macro ratios have improved, its 
economic fundamentals and negative trends have not.  Even if 
the 2007 Current Account Deficit was really "only" 6.1% of 
GDP instead of 8%, the deficit was still USD 41.6 billion and 
it is still increasing, at a time when financing is much 
harder to come by.   CPI inflation has not changed and 
remains over 8%, double the Central Bank's target.  The GDP 
growth rate for 2007 remains at 5% (but 2006 GDP growth 
increased from 6.1% to 6.9%).  Other financial ratios that 
rating agencies use in rating decisions  -- the Current 
Account Balance/Current Account Receipts and External 
Debt/Current Account Receipts ratios -- also were not 
affected by the GDP revision, so it is not a surprise that 
agencies chose not to upgrade Turkey's current, below 
investment grade sovereign rating. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) The revision will, however, help Turkey in a 
comparative sense, making it look much stronger and more 
stable vis--vis other emerging market economies with whom it 
competes for investment funds.  In the current global 
financial environment, this comparative strength is not a 
trivial advantage.  It should also make Turkey a much more 
attractive and viable EU accession country.  The increase in 
GDP per capita also is likely to make Turkey's domestic 
market more attractive for companies looking to expand their 
sales of goods and services to middle and upper income 
consumers.
