SUBJECT: COURTROOM ENCOUNTER WITH AYMAN NOUR 
 
REF: 2006 CAIRO 3006 
 
Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for Internet distribution. 
 
¶1. (SBU)  Summary: In a chance encounter on the sidelines of 
a March 10 court hearing, poloff had a brief conversation 
with jailed former opposition leader Ayman Nour.  Nour, 
looking pale but generally healthy, said he was "extremely 
grateful" for all of the USG's efforts on his behalf: "I 
cannot find words to express my appreciation."  Poloff 
replied that the U.S. is trying its best to obtain his 
release.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) We attended a March 10 hearing at the 18th District 
Cairo Felonies Court of a 2006 libel case that Nour and his 
wife, Gameela Ismail, had filed against the now-defunct 
newspaper "Sawt al Bulaq" (Voice of Bulaq). Nour was in 
attendance, which is unusual; since the appeal of his 5-year 
sentence was rejected on May 18, 2006 (reftel), we have not 
seen Nour at any of the numerous court hearings we have 
attended.  Nour, looking pale but generally healthy, 
chain-smoking throughout the proceedings, was sitting in the 
front row of the courtroom next to Ismail and his lawyer. 
All other prisoners in the courtroom were locked in a large 
cage on the left-hand side of the facility, and dressed in 
the standard Egyptian inmate's white pajamas.  Nour, dressed 
in street clothes, was clearly getting special treatment, 
perhaps in part because he was the plaintiff in this lawsuit, 
rather than the defendant. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Poloff caught Nour's eye during the hearing.  During 
a subsequent break in court proceedings, Nour was hustled out 
of the courtroom into an adjoining room.  Ismail informed 
poloff that Nour, pleased by USG attendance at the hearing, 
wanted to meet briefly.  Surprisingly, the security guards 
outside the side-room did not raise any protest when Ismail 
and poloff made their way inside.  Nour, greeting poloff with 
a firm handshake, said that he was "extremely grateful" for 
all of the USG's efforts on his behalf - "I cannot find words 
to express my appreciation."  Poloff replied that it was an 
honor to meet him, and said that U.S. is trying its best to 
obtain his release.  Further conversation was inhibited by 
the presence of four senior SSIS officers in the room.
