SUBJECT: MALAYSIA AND OIC SPECIAL ENVOY CUMBER'S REQUEST 
FOR MEETING AT OIC SUMMIT 
 
REF: STATE 23596 
 
¶1.  (U) We informed the Malaysian Foreign Ministry's OIC 
division on March 7 of Special Envoy Cumber's interest in a 
meeting with the Malaysian delegation at the OIC Summit in 
Dakar.  We also provided contact telephone numbers per 
reftel.  We have copied the same information to Malaysia's 
chief OIC diplomat, Ambassador Ibrahim Abdullah, who  arrived 
in Senegal today.  Ambassador Ibrahim's cell phone number is 
60-12-334-5957.  Ambassador Ibrahim has an excellent command 
of English.  Post provides background on Malaysia's OIC role 
and related policies below. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) OIC Role, Areas for Cooperation:  Malaysia has 
served as Chairman of the OIC since October 2003.  Acting in 
this role, Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi has attempted to 
"put an economic face" on the OIC by focusing on economic 
development, education, and trade and investment within the 
Islamic world.  Malaysian has sought to develop an OIC 
capacity building program to reduce poverty and has supported 
the World Islamic Economic Forum to enhance trade and 
investment, often using Malaysia's own economic success as a 
reference.  Prime Minister Abdullah has leveraged his OIC 
chairmanship to bolster his government's goal of 
strengthening trade and investment ties with OIC countries; 
trade between Malaysia and OIC members reportedly increased 
54 percent from 2004 to 2007.  Malaysia is most likely to be 
receptive to U.S. collaboration in areas related to promoting 
advanced technology, educational opportunities, and possibly 
Islamic finance. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Malaysia and Inter-Faith Dialogue:  Malaysia 
perceives itself as playing "a key role in promoting dialogue 
between the West and the Muslim World," according to the 
current Malaysian ruling coalition manifesto.  Prime Minister 
Abdullah promotes the concept of "Islam Hadhari," described 
as a model for "progressive Islamic civilization," with an 
emphasis on economic and technological advancement.  Prime 
Minister Abdullah often has engaged in inter-religious 
dialogues on the international stage, most recently in 
January at the Alliance of Civilizations forum in Madrid.  At 
home, however, the Malaysian government has struggled with 
growing controversies regarding the rights of the country's 
40 percent non-Muslim population, and has stopped public 
discussion of some inter-faith issues, like the religious 
freedom clause in the constitution, perceived as too 
sensitive and a threat to national stability. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Foreign Policy Elements:  The Palestine issue has 
great resonance among Malaysia's Muslim population, and 
features prominently in Malaysia's foreign policy 
pronouncements.  Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar 
took part in the Annapolis Conference, but Malaysia does not 
have diplomatic relations with Israel.  Malaysia contributes 
peacekeepers to UNIFIL.  Malaysia has opposed U.S. actions in 
Iraq, while some leaders have quietly acknowledged the 
importance of the U.S. and NATO role in Afghanistan.  Shia 
Islam is banned in Malaysia, but the Malaysian public appears 
generally sympathetic to Iran in its perceived stand-off with 
the West over its nuclear program.
