SUBJECT: BURMA REFERENDUM: FRANCE SEEKS P-3 UNITY BEFORE 
DEMARCHING ASEAN 
 
REF: 08 STATE 26677 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Andrew Young for reasons 1.4(B) and 
(D) 
 
Poloff delivered reftel demarche to MFA Burma desk officer 
Jeremie Petite on March 14 outlining our view that Burma's 
proposed May referendum will not adhere to internationally 
accepted standards for free and fair elections.  Petite 
agreed with U.S. concerns, but said France does not want to 
reject the referendum outright in deference to lack of ASEAN 
unity.  Noting that France believes ASEAN is critical to 
successful pressure on Burma, Petite said the French proposed 
as an initial step to consult with UK counterparts on March 
27 and follow with P-3 talks to achieve a unified position on 
how best to enlist ASEAN in next steps with Burma.
