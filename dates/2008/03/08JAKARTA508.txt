¶1. (SBU) Summary: In a meeting on March 10, 2008, an International 
Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code verification team from 
U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) informed Deputy Director for Patrol and 
Security Untung, Head of Section for Security Affairs Mukhlis 
Tohepaly, and other Directorate General of Sea Transportation (DGST) 
staff that the team will recommend exemption status for three 
private port facilities from Conditions of Entry as per the Port 
Security Advisory (PSA) that went into effect on February 25, 2008. 
The port facilities are British Petroleum's Arco Ardjuna, Chevron's 
Santan Marine Terminal and Newmont Nusa Tenggara. DGST reiterated 
their prioritization for exemption of the six previously visited 
public ports and explained that Indonesian regulation prohibits a 
foreign Recognized Security Organization (RSO) from conducting 
verification of ISPS Code compliance.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The USCG team consisting of Lt. Com. Michael Long, Lt. Com. 
Philemon Purganan, Lt. Com. Scott Stoermer and Lt. Justin Jacobs 
visited Arco Ardjuna, Santan Marine Terminal and Newmont Nusa 
Tenggara from March 4-8, 2008. They told the DGST representatives 
that they were impressed with the security standards maintained at 
all three facilities.  They recommended that Newmont Nusa Tenggara 
be used as a model of ISPS compliance for Indonesian port 
facilities.  DGST said that PT Freeport Indonesia, a subsidiary of 
Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc., had inquired about exemption 
for a port facility in Papua that will become operational in 2009. 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) DGST requested USCG to return for a revisit without ASPP 
requirements of the six previously visited public ports found to be 
not substantially implementing the ISPS Code: Jamrud Pelindo III 
Tanjung Perak, Terminal Petikemas Koja Jakarta, Semarang 
Conventional/Cruise Terminal, Belawan International Container 
Terminal, PT Pelabuhan Indonesia II Cabang Padang and Duks PT Semen 
Padang. Long said he would present the request to USCG 
headquarters. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Untung said that an RSO must be Indonesian-owned in order 
to conduct ISPS verification according to regulation enacted by 
ministerial decree and based on the ISPS Code.  At the request of 
DGST, Long agreed that a USCG representative would meet with 
Indonesian RSOs at the next opportunity when USCG returns to 
Jakarta.  Long said he expected USCG Headquarters to approve a 
template for the Alternative Security Procedure Process soon. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Tohepaly repeated DGST's request for capacity building.  He 
said that DGST was currently receiving assistance from Japan, 
Australia, Singapore and China.
