SUBJECT: MARCH 6 UPDATE: COLOMBIA DISPUTE WITH ECUADOR AND 
VENEZUELA 
 
REF: BOGOTA 839 AND PREVIOUS 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (U) Venezuela continued to restrict the import of 
Colombian goods and people into Venezuela in response to the 
GOC's March 1 attack against the FARC in Ecuador (reftel). 
Still, the flow of food and other perishable products 
continued.  Businessmen reported GOV authorities were lifting 
restrictions in some areas due to shortages.  The border with 
Ecuador remained open.  Meanwhile, on March 6, Nicaraguan 
President Daniel Ortega announced he would break diplomatic 
relations with Colombia.  The GOC said it would expect full 
and fair payment in the event of Venezuelan nationalization 
of Colombian firms.  The GOC detailed 39 cases of FARC 
attacks against Colombian forces from Ecuador from 2004-2008, 
resulting in 20 members of the security forces killed.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
 
BORDERS: SOME GOV RESTRICTIONS IN PLACE, ECUADOR OPEN 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶2. (U) The Colombian border with Venezuela remained only 
partially open on March 6, with most food, medicine, and 
other perishables passing into Venezuela.  Other goods are 
restricted, and the entry of people into Venezuela from Cesar 
and Arauca was delayed by backups for visas/permits.  The 
border with Ecuador remained open.  The GOV blocked 
contraband gasoline shipments into far-northen Guajira 
Department, causing local protests after the prices rose from 
approximately $1.60 to $2.40 per gallon.  National Industrial 
Association President Luis Carlos Villegas told us he already 
sees evidence that Venezuelan consumers are feeling the pinch 
of limited border closures, forcing local GOV officials to 
relax some restrictions.  Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, 
speaking after a March 6 meeting with President Rafael 
Correa, announced he would break diplomatic relations with 
Colombia. 
 
 
GOC REACTS TO CHAVEZ NATIONALIZATION THREAT 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) In response to President Chavez' March 5 threats to 
nationalize Colombian investments in Venezuela, Colombian 
Finance Minister Oscar Zuluaga said Colombian business could 
face a "difficult situation," but would expect full payment 
from Venezuela for any nationalizations. Colombia's 
Ambassador to the OAS Camilo Ospina added that Colombia would 
take any unfair nationalizations to international tribunals 
or arbitration--citing the Exxon-Mobil case. 
 
 
GOC CONTINUES TO MAKE ITS CASE 
------------------------------ 
 
¶4. (U) The GOC continued to make its case for the March 1 
attack in Ecuador against FARC secretariat member Raul Reyes, 
as MFA officials told us President Alvaro Uribe left early 
for the Rio Group meeting in the Dominican Republic to meet 
with foreign leaders.  Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos 
released figures showing 39 documented cases of FARC attacks 
against Colombia from Ecuadorian territory between 2004-2008, 
resulting in 20 Colombian soldiers/police killed and 16 
wounded.  Santos said various GOC entities had communicated 
on dozens of occasions with the Ecuadorian Government to 
protest the FARC's presence in Ecuador or to denounce FARC 
attacks from Ecuadorian territory.  The GOC received few 
responses.  Ospina added from Washington that Ecuador and 
Venezuela could be sanctioned by the OAS for "sponsorship of 
terrorism" once all evidence against them was reviewed. 
 
 
REACTION TO OAS RESOLUTION 
-------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Local media called the OAS resolution on the Reyes 
attack "bittersweet," and credited Colombian Ambassador to 
the OAS Camilo Ospina for negotiating a "benign" result. 
Commentators also praised the OAS' decision to examine the 
 
BOGOTA 00000903  002 OF 002 
 
 
facts surrounding the case from both sides of the border, 
including the numerous FARC camps inside Ecuador and evidence 
seized from Reyes' computers.  Former Foreign Minister 
Augusto Ramirez Ocampo voiced satisfaction with the outcome 
in the OAS, but said the increasingly close ties between 
Presidents Correa and Chavez are worrying.  Only three weeks 
ago, GOC policy makers were congratulating themselves on 
their ability to separate Correa from Chavez.
