PARTICIPATION IN THE OECD 
 
REF: A. STATE 20058 
 
     ¶B. 07 STATE 82462 
 
¶1. (SBU) On March 18, Econoff delivered Ref A points to John 
Rowan, the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs' chief for 
multilateral economic organizations -- and former Irish 
Ambassador to the OECD.  Rowan said that Ireland shared the 
U.S. view on the matter and would support our position.  He 
pointed out that the Irish government, like the U.S. 
government, does not support Taiwan's full membership but 
that, given its economic stature, it should continue to play 
a role.  He said that the OECD should remain apolitical and 
if efforts such as China's were successful it would be 
"harmful to the organization's reputation in the long-run."
