¶1. (SBU) This is another in a series of weekly reports on PKK 
violence in Turkey.  Our primary source is the Turkish General Staff

well as casualties incurred. 
 
¶2. (U) During the March 16-23, 2008 reporting period, no Turkish 
security official was killed or injured.  The total number of 
security force casualties for the year through March 23, 2008 was 20 
killed and 18 injured. 
 
¶3. (U) During the same period, six PKK terrorists were captured and 
another two surrendered.  None were killed.  According to official 
TGS website figures, through the third week of March, the number of 
PKK militants killed this year was 260, the number of those captured 
was 70, and the number of those who surrendered was 30. 
 
¶4. (U) Two civilians died and an undetermined number (well into the 
dozens) were injured during unauthorized Nevruz celebrations in Van 
on March 22 and in Yuksekova, Hakkari Province on March 23. 
Civilian casualties linked to PKK-related violence and counter-PKK 
operations for the year through the end of the third week of March 
were nine killed, with another 49 wounded.
