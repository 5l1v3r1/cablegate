¶1.  (U)  Econ Chief forwarded ref A points on March 3 to 
Peter Post, Head of the OECD Unit, Dutch Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs.  Econ Chief also shared the points with Jerome 
Larosch, OECD Coordinator in the Trade Policy Unit, Dutch 
Ministry of Economic Affairs.  Post was not available to meet 
and discuss the points until March 19. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Post said the GONL supported the USG position of 
maintaining the current OECD policy (based on the 1995 SG 
Paye letter), which allows Taiwan's technical participation 
in appropriate OECD activities.  The GONL valued Chinese 
Taipei's participation as an economy and not as a sovereign 
state, he noted, and saw no need for the proposed MOU from 
China.  He confirmed Dutch support for the position presented 
by France, on behalf of the EU Presidency, at the March 17 
OECD External Relations Committee (ERC), reported ref B. 
Post said the GONL supported the ERC consensus position and 
recommendations presented to SG Gurria by ERC Chair Joan Boer 
(Dutch) and China Reflection Group Head Ambassador Cabras. 
He was doubtful that the issue of Taiwan's status would even 
be raised by PRC officials during SG Gurria's upcoming visit 
to Beijing, given a recent focus on developments in Tibet.
