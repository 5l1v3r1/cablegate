SUBJECT: EU GAERC: CZECH COMMENTS IN ADVANCE OF THE MARCH 
10 MEETING 
 
REF: STATE 22352 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: Emboff met with Anna Sykova, Deputy 
Director of the Czech MFA Department of Common Foreign and 
Security Policy prior to the March 10-11 EU General Affairs 
and External Relations Council (GAERC).  Of note were her 
comments on Kosovo, Afghanistan, Syria and Zimbabwe.  While 
Sykova anticipates that Iran will be a key topic of 
discussion, she does not expect any EU statement since no 
work is being done currently to prepare GAERC conclusions on 
Iran. 
 
---------- 
Western Balkans 
---------- 
2, (SBU)  Sykova anticipates that, like last month, the EU 
Foreign Ministers are likely to spend much of their time 
discussing Kosovo.  Given that the Czech Republic is a member 
of the International Steering Group, we inquired about the 
timing of the GOCR's formal recognition of Kosovo.  Sykova 
referenced Prime Minister Topolanek's current travel schedule 
(March 8-11 he will be in Jordan and Israel) and the upcoming 
cabinet meeting on March 17 as the earliest and most likely 
date for the GOCR to initiate formal action, which is in 
keeping with PM Topolanek's comments to President Bush in 
late February. 
 
 
---------- 
Afghanistan 
---------- 
¶3. (SBU) On Afghanistan, Synkova noted that there would be 
GAERC conclusions on this topic which would express support 
for the review by the Joint Coordination and Monitoring 
Board, which met the week of February 1 in Tokyo, on the 
implementation of the Afghan Compact.  The EU will also 
highlight the EU Police Mission, which will be operational by 
the end of March and express readiness to consider further 
enhancement of its broader engagement in Afghanistan. 
Synkova also noted that March is an important month for the 
Czechs because they will formally celebrate the establishment 
of the newest PRT in Logar, Afghanistan.  (Note: The Czechs 
plan to formally take over command and control of PRT Logar 
on March 20. End Note.) 
 
---------- 
Lebanon - Engagement with Syria 
---------- 
¶4. (SBU) Synkova thanked Emboff for our points on Lebanon and 
Syria.  She referenced the GOCR support for the varied EU 
statements on the situation in both nations.  On the topic of 
visits by Western diplomats to Damascus, Synkova acknowledged 
the visit last month to Syria by Czech opposition leader 
Paroubek.  While unfortunate, in her words, and not in line 
with the position of the GOCR, she pointed out that Paroubek 
traveled in his party capacity and he did not speak on behalf 
of the government. 
 
 
---------- 
Zimbabwe 
---------- 
¶5. (SBU) According to the Czechs, the EU shares our concern 
that there need to be election monitors in Zimbabwe.  In its 
GAERC conclusions, the EU will highlight its humanitarian and 
economic concerns in Zimbabwe and note the EU role as the 
most significant donor to the country.  It will bluntly note 
that the EU has not been invited to send a formal observer 
mission to oversee these elections and it will state that the 
EU's targeted sanctions are specifically aimed against the 
regime leaders responsible for Zimbabwe's current crisis and 
not the general public.
