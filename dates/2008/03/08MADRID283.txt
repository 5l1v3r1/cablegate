SUBJECT: VISIT TO SPAIN OF ELSA MOREJON, WIFE OF CUBAN 
DISSIDENT OSCAR BISCET 
 
 
¶1. (U) Elsa Morejon, wife of imprisoned Cuban dissident and 
Presidential Medal of Freedom winner Oscar Biscet, visited 
Spain March 4-7.  Although the visit was unexpected (her 
arrival was not confirmed until a few hours before her flight 
to Madrid), we are convinced it was useful and important. 
Ms. Morejon, accompanied by Lawton Foundation Vice President 
Dr. Angel Garrido, met with MFA Secretary of State Trinidad 
Jimenez and Director General for Iberoamerica Javier 
Sandomingo, former President Aznar, and Amnesty 
International.  She also gave two interviews with Spanish 
media (ABC and Epoca).  By happy coincidence, Ms. Morejon, 
who along with Dr. Garrido was a guest at the Ambassador's 
residence, was able to participate in a previously scheduled 
meeting the Ambassador held with members of the Cuban 
dissident community, including four recently released 
dissidents (Pedro Pablo Alvarez Ramos, Omar Pernet Hernandez, 
Jose Gabriel Ramon Castillo, and Alejandro Gonzalez Raga) who 
arrived in Spain February 17.  Ms. Morejon was also able to 
renew her visa here for her return trip to the U.S. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ms. Morejon related that in an hour-long meeting 
Jimenez said Spain had raised her husband's case with the GOC 
twice (most recently in the February 11 installment of the 
two governments' human rights dialogue) and promised that 
Spain would do so again in June.  Following his meeting with 
Ms. Morejon, Aznar released a statement affirming his 
interest in Dr. Biscet's case and his "total support" for Ms. 
Morejon.  The daily ABC carried a lengthy interview with Ms. 
Morejon which stressed the incongruity of the GOC signing 
human rights agreements while keeping Dr. Biscet and other 
political prisoners behind bars.
