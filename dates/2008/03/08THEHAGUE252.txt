¶1. (U) SUMMARY:  Post verified AD-S' role as a foreign intermediary 
for the French Air Force (FAF) and the company appeared to be a 
responsible recipient of USML items.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Emboffs met with Peter de Smalen, Director, AD-S on March 3 
to conduct reftel post-shipment verification and site visit in 
relation to the export of a large quantity of C-130 spare parts to 
the FAF.  AD-S is a subsidiary of Avio-Diepen, an independent 
distributor in the aerospace industry.  Avio-Diepen acquired the 
AD-S business in November 2006.  De Smalen explained that AD-S' core 
activity is brokering military aviation spare parts and it is one of 
the Netherlands' leading independent traders in this sector.  For 
the purpose of comparison, he mentioned Derco Aerospace and 
Kellstrom Industries (both U.S. companies) as competitors.  De 
Smalen said that AD-S' revenue in 2007 was approximately 12 million 
Euros and it had ten full-time employees.  He said that AD-S focuses 
its sales efforts on a short list of about ten established 
customers, including the Dutch Armed Forces, NAMSA (NATO's 
centralized procurement arm), OGMA (Industria Aeronautica de 
Portugal), the Portuguese Air Force, the FAF, the Singapore Air 
Force, and Singapore Technologies (ST Engineering). 
 
¶3. (SBU) Regarding license 050061621 for the export of C-130 
aircraft spare parts to the FAF, de Smalen said that AD-S had won a 
tender to supply the parts and was sourcing them from R.S. Aviation 
in Florida.  He said that, to date, AD-S had only supplied parts 
totalling several thousand dollars but that R.S. Aviation had 
suggested obtaining a blanket license for USD 2 million to cover 
present and future shipments to the FAF.  De Smalen provided Emboffs 
with purchase orders, invoices, and contracts for R.S. Aviation, 
AD-S, and OGMA (the foreign consignee for the FAF parts).  Post can 
provide copies upon request. 
 
¶4. (U) De Smalen assured Emboffs that every employee at AD-S takes 
license compliance very seriously.  He appeared to have a firm 
understanding of the obligations associated with the export license. 
 Emboff interactions with de Smalen were cordial and professional.
