SUBJECT: Sharing Information to Resolve IPR Issues 
 
 
1.(SBU) Summary and Comment. Two returned IVLP participants 
expressed the hope and expectation that most IPR issues could be 
resolved quickly with genuine working-level interaction between 
Chinese and American experts.  Both professors were struck with the 
candor of their American counterparts and the Americans' willingness 
to engage in an open and non-judgmental discussion of IPR issues. 
As a result of the professors' participation in this program, we 
were able to work with them to obtain Jinan University's last minute 
agreement to host a joint U.S.-China IPR Program on March 4 after 
local governmental cooperation fell through.  In the longer term, 
Jinan University plans to organize scholarly exchanges with U.S. 
universities on IPR issues; South China University of Technology has 
also informed us that it will change its IPR-related curriculum. 
End Summary and Comment. 
 
Expanding Academic Contacts 
--------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Professor Xu Xuan, Deputy Dean and Professor at the 
Intellectual Property School of Jinan University's Law School, and a 
recent participant in the International Visitor Leadership program, 
was instrumental in helping us organize  an impromptu intellectual 
property seminar at the school on March 4.  Over eighty persons 
signed up to attend the seminar, including numerous U.S. and Chinese 
IP experts, officials and students.  The program had been previously 
scheduled as a joint event with the Guangdong Provincial IP Office, 
but funding and other disagreements led to its cancellation at the 
last minute.  Without Professor Xu's willingness to host the 
program, the program probably would have been postponed, and an 
important opportunity to cooperate on IP issues lost. 
 
¶4. (U) Additionally, Professor Xu Xuan told PAS of her plans to 
expand Jinan University's scholarly exchange opportunities with U.S. 
universities that have IPR research centers.  This could culminate 
in a semester or year-long professional exchange between schools. 
She also expects to cooperate with American professors on research 
projects related to IPR issues in China. 
 
 
Class Is In Session 
------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) While in the U.S., Professor Guan Yunhong of South China 
University of Technology focused on learning about IPR curriculums 
being used at American universities.  Upon returning to China, he 
drafted a report comparing IPR courses at Chinese and American 
institutions. Professor Guan intends to use his contacts and 
experiences to develop an IPR curriculum for the Law School at South 
China University of Technology.  Before Professor Guan's 
participation in this program, the school had planned an 
undergraduate program in IPR for 40 students. Since his return and 
dissemination of the report, the school has doubled the intended 
size of the program. 
 
America the Beautiful 
--------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) The two professors were surprised how open and willing their 
American interlocutors were in addressing difficult issues in short 
hour-long meetings.  They said that if Chinese and American experts 
were to engage in direct and frank talks, many IPR issues between 
the two countries could be resolved quickly.  Professor Xu remarked 
that "You would assume that America would hide its resources and 
keep them secret, but instead they are open and willing to share 
with everyone. That is what makes America great. There's a reason 
it's called 'Beautiful Country,' because America and Americans 
really are 'Beautiful.'" (Note: The Chinese characters for America 
translate as Beautiful Country. End Note.)
