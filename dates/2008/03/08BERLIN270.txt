Dear Madam Secretary, 
 
Thank you very much for your invitation to participate in the 
Washington International Renewable Energy Conference (WIREC) 
from 4 to 6 March, and for the opportunity to give an opening 
address. 
 
I would have liked to take up your invitation, but I just 
learned that I will be obliged to attend a meeting of the 
German Bundestag. I know that this is very unfortunate and 
apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. Regrettably, 
such rescheduling at short notice cannot always be avoided. 
 
Parliamentary State Secretary Michael Mueller will take part 
on my behalf. 
 
I wish the conference every success. 
 
Yours Sincerely, 
Sigmar Gabriel
