SUBJECT: TREASURY MINISTER SAYS NO NEW IMF STAND-BY 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: Treasury Minister Mehmet Simsek was widely 
reported in the press March 17 as saying that Turkey did not need a 
new stand-by agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 
Simsek said the GOT is considering other types of agreements with 
the IMF after the current stand-by agreement expires on May 10.  IMF 
Deputy Resident Representative Davide Lombardo said there have been 
no discussions yet about post-program relations.  He said the IMF 
was considering combining the remaining reviews and making the full 
USD 3 billion under the current program available, if time permits. 
End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Minister Simsek was speaking in New York at a 
Turkish-American Business Council meeting.  He said that Turkey's 
economy could withstand global economic turmoil and a new IMF 
stand-by agreement was not needed.  He added that Turkey could 
consider post-program monitoring or the use of a precautionary 
stand-by agreement.  The current IMF stand-by agreement expires May 
¶10.  It has been an anchor for Turkey's economic success since the 
2001 financial crisis, and investors are very interested in what 
relationship Turkey will have with the IMF after the current program 
expires. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Minister Simsek is expected to meet IMF Managing Director 
Dominique Strauss-Kahn on March 20 in Washington.  The GOT and the 
IMF have not completed the seventh review under the current 
agreement, due to continued delays in Parliamentary adoption of the 
social security reform, a seventh review pre-condition. 
 
¶4. (SBU) We met with IMF Deputy Resident Representative Davide 
Lombardo on March 17.  Lombardo said the IMF was aware of 
parliamentary delays but remained confident about GOT resolve to 
finally pass the Social Security Reform.  Lombardo confirmed IMF and 
the GOT had not made any agreements about relations after the 
current program expires.  He noted that it was important for the GOT 
to provide a favorable environment to attract continued 
international investment.  Turkey's high current account deficit 
remains a risk, especially in an environment with record oil prices. 
 Lombardo said the plan was for the GOT to complete two more 
reviews, provided they meet the relevant conditionality, and have 
access to the full remaining un-disbursed amount, which is just 
under USD 3 billion.  Lombardo noted the possibility of a 
combination of the final reviews, although the fast-approaching 
deadline may not allow this to happen. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: While we are reporting Simsek's remarks from press 
reports, multiple newspapers quoted him as saying no to a new 
stand-by.  While loosening the IMF anchor may seem inadvisable in 
the current environment (with global financial uncertainty, a 
tarnished EU anchor, and deteriorating economic indicators), it 
tracks with GOT thinking that it does not want its hands tied on 
economic and fiscal policies.  End comment.
