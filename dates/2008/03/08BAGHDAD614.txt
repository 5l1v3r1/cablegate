SUBJECT: PRT MAYSAN MEETS WITH GOVERNOR FOR FIRST TIME 
 
¶1.  (SBU) THIS IS A PRT MAYSAN REPORTING CABLE. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY: ON FEBRUARY 25 MAYSAN PRT MET WITH 
GOVERNOR ADIL MOHUDER RADI AL-MALIKI AND HIS SENIOR ADVISOR, 
ZAID HOSHI AL-KALLAF TO DISCUSS SECURITY, ONGOING PROJECTS, 
AND TEAM ACCESS TO THE PROVINCE.  THE PRT PRESSED THE 
GOVERNOR ON THE ISSUE OF ACCESS, A POINT THE GOVERNOR 
ACKNOWLEDGED BUT WAS RELUCTANT TO COMMIT TO SPECIFICS GIVEN 
THE THREAT OF "GANGS AND FUGITIVES."  GOVERNOR ADIL SAID 
MAYSAN HAD "MOVED FORWARD" BUT NEEDED IDEAS AND EXPERIENCE 
FROM THE PRT.  HE BELIEVES HE HAS BUILT A SYSTEM FOR BRINGING 
ONGOING PROJECTS TO CONCLUSION AND SEEKS PRT ASSISTANCE 
TRAINING MAYSANI ENGINEERS TO DEVELOP CRITICAL-NEED SKILL 
SETS; PARTICULARLY SKILLS WITH NEW TECHNOLOGIES.  HE ALSO 
SEEKS FUNDING FOR NEW PROJECTS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
PRT ACCESS TO MAYSAN 
-------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) THE PRT PRESSED THE GOVERNOR ON THE ISSUE OF ACCESS 
TO THE PROVINCE, EXPLAINING THAT, WHILE MAYSANI ENGINEERS 
WERE CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF PROJECTS IN MAYSAN, THE US 
GOVERNMENT HAD STRICT REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MONITORING OF 
PROJECTS THAT IT FUNDS.  THE GOVERNOR AGREED IN PRINCIPLE ON 
THE NEED FOR PRT ACCESS TO MAYSAN AND SAID THAT HE WAS "READY 
TO COOPERATE FOR ANY VISIT AT ANY TIME."  HOWEVER, HE 
CONTINUED, THERE EXIST COMPLICATIONS THAT DEMAND A "CAUTIOUS 
AND CAREFUL" APPROACH TO ENTRY TO THE PROVINCE.  &THERE ARE 
GROUPS THAT WANT TO BUILD A BARRIER BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT 
AND THE PRT,8 HE ELABORATED, "TO GENERATE CHAOS AND ALLOW 
INTERNATIONAL ACTORS TO MOVE FURTHER INTO MAYSAN.  ILLEGAL 
THINGS ARE NOT BEING DONE BY MAYSANIS, BUT BY FOREIGN 
GOVERNMENTS."  THE GOVERNOR REPEATEDLY MENTIONED THE THREAT 
POSED BY "GANGS AND GROUPS" CONTROLLED BY OUTSIDE ELEMENTS, 
ALTHOUGH HE ASSERTED THAT THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT WAS 
WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT TO "DO AWAY WITH 
THESE GANGS AND FUGITIVES."  HE CONCLUDED THAT EVEN AS HE 
WORKS AGAINST THESE OUTSIDE FORCES HE MUST NOT IMPERIL HIS 
POPULATION. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) THE TEAM REGIONAL SECURITY OFFICER SUGGESTED 
ESTABLISHING A SECURITY COUNTERPART FOR THE TEAM TO 
COORDINATE MEETING AND SECURITY DETAILS.  GOVERNOR ADIL 
AGREED AND SAID HE WOULD WORK WITH THE "CHIEF OF ARMY" TO 
IDENTIFY A SECURITY POINT OF CONTACT. 
 
PROJECT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) THE GOVERNOR OUTLINED A PROJECT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
THAT HE SAID ENSURES ADEQUATE COORDINATION AND SUPERVISION 
FOR PROJECTS IN MAYSAN.  THE SYSTEM HINGES ON A CENTER OF 
PLANNING AND STRATEGY, COMPRISED OF A COORDINATION 
DEPARTMENT, CONSULTANT COMMITTEE, AND SUPERVISING OFFICE. 
HEADED BY MR. ZAID, THE COORDINATION DEPARTMENT MANAGES THE 
MULTITUDE OF PROJECTS STAGING IN MAYSAN PROVINCE.  THE 
CONSULTANT COMMITTEE DECIDES WHICH PROJECTS TO PURSUE BASED 
ON THE TECHNICAL DETAILS OF EACH PROJECT.  FINALLY, THE 
CENTER OF PLANNING AND STRATEGY,S SUPERVISING OFFICE, MADE 
UP OF 150 IRAQI ENGINEERS, SUPERVISES WORKERS ON PROJECT 
SITES AND CARRIES OUT PROJECTS DESIGNED IN THE CONSULTANT 
COMMITTEE. 
 
COMMENT: GOVERNOR KEEPING PRT AT ARM,S LENGTH 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) IT IS CLEAR THE GOVERNOR APPRECIATES THE PRT / GRS 
NEED FOR PHYSICAL ACCESS TO THE PROVINCE.  WHAT IS EQUALLY 
CLEAR IS HIS RELUCTANCE TO EXTEND A CONCRETE INVITATION TO 
VISIT.  END COMMENT.
