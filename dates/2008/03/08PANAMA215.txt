--------------------------------- 
POLOFF Support for Kearsarge Visit 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Embassy Panama has identified two EMBOFFs to support 
the visit of the USS KEARSARGE to Panama from September 16 to 
¶30.  POLCOUNS Brian Naranjo will join the USS KEARSARGE in 
Cartagena, Colombia on/about September 15.  Since the USS 
KEARSARGE will be in Cartagena on liberty from September 10 
to 15, Mr. Naranjo will not/not join the ship three-days 
prior to the ships departure from Cartagena. On/about 
September 22, POLOFF Eric Geelan will replace Mr. Naranjo. 
Due to limited staffing at post and the significant amount of 
time that the USS KEARSARGE will deployed in Panama, Embassy 
Panama cannot assign one officer to cover all estimated 15 
days of this deployment, but rather will need to rotate 
POLOFFs.
