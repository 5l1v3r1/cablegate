REF: STATE 22448 
 
¶1. (U) Reftel requests post's comments regarding OPIC's direct loan 
to Global Partnerships Microfinance Fund 2008 (The Fund).  The Fund 
has an established track record working with many of Nicaragua's 
microfinance institutions (MFIs).  We are not aware of any 
derogatory information on the Fund or its operations in country. 
There are over 300 MFIs registered in Nicaragua, managing a 
portfolio of over USD 400 million.  While two institutions dominate 
half of this market, about forty, mostly located in rural areas not 
reached by formal banks, provide essential financial services to 
Nicaragua's poorest producers. 
 
¶2. (U) All four Nicaraguan MFI institutions being screened by the 
Fund for participation in the program are well established in 
Nicaragua.  All are members of the National Association of 
Microfinance Institutions (ASOMIF) and have received funds from 
international institutions, including the Ford Foundation, USAID, 
and the Inter-American Development Bank.  Post is not aware of any 
derogatory information regarding these institutions.  Paragraphs 
below summarize information on each MFI. 
 
¶3. (U) Fondo del Desarrollo Local (FDL): Founded by the Jesuit 
University Universidad Centroamericana, FDL is one of the largest 
NGO MFIs in Nicaragua.  It focuses primarily on providing credit to 
the rural sector through 28 branch offices thorough out the country. 
 FDL's lending focuses on promoting entrepreneurs, with half of the 
funds going to agricultural projects.  In 2006 FDL had a gross loan 
portfolio of USD 53 million, total assets of USD 66 million, and 
72,000 active borrowers.  Web site: www.fdl.org.ni 
 
¶4. (U) Cooperativa 20 de Abril: This is a multi-service cooperative 
focused exclusively on offering services in the municipality of 
Quilali in the department of Nueva Segovia.  The cooperative has 
four principal activities: commercialization of agricultural goods, 
micro-credit, savings, and a co-op owned store.  It is the only 
institution in Quilali that offers savings accounts and the store is 
the only outlet in Quilali for many consumer and agricultural goods. 
 Of the loan portfolio 80% goes to agricultural activities.  In 2005 
the Cooperative had a gross loan portfolio of USD 5.6 million, total 
assets of USD 6.4 million, and 5,700 active borrowers. E-mail:

southern and eastern sides of Lake Nicaragua and the western part of 
the southern Atlantic Coast region.  In many remote towns, PRODESA 
is the only financial institution of any kind, including MFIs. 
PRODESA's loans go to agriculture, livestock and housing mortgages. 
In 2005 it had a gross loan portfolio of USD 14.7 million, total 
assets of USD 16.8 million, and 16,000 active borrowers.  E-mail:
