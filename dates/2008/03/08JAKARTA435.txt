¶1. Summary. Indonesian Air Force (IAF) officer Colonel Robert 
confirmed that IAF ordered the antiskid generator test set detailed 
in reftel from CV Langgeng Mandiri Jati (Langgeng.  He said that the 
IAF received the item on October 29, 2007 and that it has been used 
to check the function of the F-16's wheel brakes during maintenance 
procedures.  Langgeng confirmed that it forwarded the order to 
Indonesian firm PT Cakra Lima Pamungkas (CLIP).  CLIP verified the 
order, via PT Primandiri Perdana (Primandiri), of the test set 
detailed in reftel.  Based on our observations during site visits, 
CLIP and Primandiri appear to be legitimate business operations. 
End summary. 
 
¶2. We contacted Langgeng's Director Enah Suhaenah on February 21, 
2008 and she confirmed receiving the order detailed in reftel from 
IAF in June 2007.  She said that due to limited supplier 
connections, Langgeng requested that CLIP place the order.  On 
February 21, 2008 Colonel Robert of the IAF confirmed that Langgeng 
is a registered supplier on their list.  He said the IAF has no 
knowledge of Primandiri, CLIP or Intrasindo and they are not on the 
IAF's list of registered suppliers. 
 
¶3. We visited CLIP on February 15, 2008 and met the co-owner Jemmy 
Adriano to verify the order of items noted in reftel.  Adriano 
confirmed that his company received the order for an antiskid 
generator test set from Langgeng in June 2007, and forwarded the 
order to Primandiri soon after.  Both CLIP and Primandiri supply 
engines and aircraft spare parts to state-owned aerospace company PT 
Dirgantara Indonesia, or Indonesian Aerospace (IAe).  Both companies 
also serve as local representatives for international aircraft parts 
suppliers.  CLIP's usual suppliers, according to Adriano, supply 
engines and aircraft spare parts only to IAe.  Adriano said his 
company had difficulties finding certain aircraft spare parts and 
that Primandiri is connected to a wider network on the supply side. 
 
 
¶4. IAF placed the order with Langgeng, which subsequently forwarded 
it to CLIP.  CLIP requested that Primandiri order the item, and 
Primandiri issued a purchase order to Liberty Logistics LLC in June 
¶2007.  For tax advantage purposes, Primandiri requested that the 
seller deliver the item to Intrasindo Pte Ltd, an international 
freight forwarder specializing in handling shipments from Singapore 
to Indonesia.  The item reached Singapore on October 12, 2007 and 
was delivered to Primandiri on October 22, 2007.  Primandiri held 
the item in its storage facility for a week, and IAF received the 
antiskid generator test set on October 29, 2007.  We visited the 
storage rooms of Primandiri and CLIP.  Each room is about 170 sq 
feet, with three to four security guards each. 
 
¶5. CLIP was established in 2003, and commenced a multi-business 
operation in advertising, procurement, event-organizing, etc.  Its 
core business is supplying aircraft spare-parts to IAe.  It also 
acts as sales representative for several international suppliers, 
including US-based A.E. Petsche Co. Inc., Pacific Microtronics, Inc. 
and Metropolitan Aircraft Parts, Inc.  CLIP has 24 employees and is 
a sister company of PT Angkasa Rejeki Abadi (Angkasa), a registered 
supplier on IAF's list, and also co-owned by Adriano.  Robert 
confirmed that CLIP is a registered supplier of IAF. 
 
¶6. Founded in 1996, Primandiri also supplies equipment and aircraft 
spare parts, mostly to IAe.  Similar to CLIP, it acts as a sales 
representative for international suppliers e.g. France-based battery 
maker SAFT.  The owner, Jejen Jaenudin, showed us the Directorate 
General of Civil Aviation, Ministry of Transportation's approval of 
Primandiri as a certified distributor of aeronautical products.  An 
Aircraft Service (ACS) letter also shows that Primandiri is an 
approved supplier, subject to periodic quality audits by the quality 
control department of IAe's ACS Business Unit.  Primandiri currently 
has 20 employees.
