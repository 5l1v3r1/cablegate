¶1.  (SBU) GOSS Presidential Affairs Minister Luka Biong Deng 
recently told ConGen Juba PolOff that President Kiir was struck by 
the frank nature of Kiir's meeting with with Special Envoy Richard 
¶S. Williamson.  Deng noted that Kiir was "relieved by the clarity of 
the message."  Deng himself was less confident, however, noting that 
"obviously, this could lead us to take a stronger, more forceful 
position with the National Congress Party, but we need to be sure of 
the consistency of U.S. support - and the strength of the American 
backing."  He claimed to know "from our sources in Washington" that 
the United States is exploring "alternate options to Abyei than via 
implementation of the ABC Report alone." 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Poloff responded that the Special Envoy's openness 
required little elaboration.  The United States is deeply aware of 
its role in crafting the Abyei Protocol and remains committed to 
resolving Abyei just as it remains committed to the CPA's 
implementation.  Pressed on whether the U.S. commitment extends to 
the implementation of the ABC Report's findings, PolOff countered 
that reports presented at the Assessment and Evaluation Commission 
and elsewhere suggest that the SPLM walked away from an April 2007 
agreement reached at the SPLM/NCP Executive Committee talks that 
divorced the question of Abyei's geographical boundaries from its 
oil wealth. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Deng denied that the NCP/SPLM talks had ever reached 
agreement on Abyei-specific wealth sharing.  He asserted that the 
SPLM is open to an extraordinary agreement, but the NCP broke off 
talks without explanation and has not entertained SPLM requests 
since to restart them.  While oil is "a factor" with respect to 
Abyei, he said the preeminent concern is establishing the region's 
borders and safeguarding its right to participate in the 2011 
referendum.  PolOff noted that the USG non-paper included language 
about the Interim Administration, and that that was the first of 
many steps towards pressing President Bashir to abide by his CPA 
obligations.  Deng accepted this, but continued "I used to be one of 
those that argued we should give the NCP space (on Abyei), but I 
have abandoned that position.  Does Washington stand with me?" 
 
¶4.  (SBU) COMMENT:  Deng admitted that he had not yet seen the 
non-paper, but that he and Yasir Arman would be present with GOSS 
President Kiir when the Foreign Minister Deng Alor briefed Kiir on 
the Special Envoy's Khartoum meetings, the Abyei discussions in 
particular.  Deng was clearly probing for the depth of Washington's 
support for the GOSS in resolving Abyei, especially given the 
contrasting styles of the past and present Special Envoys.
