SUBJECT:  Egypt Contemplates Deporting 400 Eritreans 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Ambassador met March 24 with Egyptian Ambassador Ihab 
Hamouda to discuss the presence of illegal Eritrean immigrants in 
Egypt, of which Ihab claims there are more than 400.  Ihab said the 
government of Egypt and the Eritrean Ministry of Foreign Affairs are 
discussing a procedure for returning these immigrants-cum-refugees. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Ambassador Ihab described two ways that Eritreans travel 
to Egypt. The first has been by obtaining Egyptian visas through 
misrepresentation by the Eritrean MFA.  Ihab stated that Eritrean 
MFA employees routinely call the Egyptian Consulate on behalf of 
private citizens (presumed to be the result of bribes).  The 
Egyptian Embassy has learned that many of these visa recipients have 
attempted to cross the Israeli border through Egypt.  The second 
method involves traveling via Sudan up the Red Sea Coast towards 
Egypt.  Ihab noted that these immigrants do not have Egyptian visas 
and generally tend to stay a week on the Eastern coast, before 
continuing north to the Sinai and eventually crossing into Israel. 
Ihab commented that Egypt has 750 police along the Sinai border, a 
grossly inadequate number needed to address this illegal migration. 
Several Eritreans have been killed trying to cross from Egypt into 
Israel in the past month, according to press reports. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) COMMENT:  Despite the known dangers of crossing the very 
sensitive Egypt-Israel border, many Eritreans attempt the journey, 
another indication of the desperation of the populace in the face of 
Eritrean living conditions.  Concerns about swelling numbers of 
Eritrean refugees and immigrants have been voiced to us by officials 
from the U.K., Sweden, Switzerland, Sudan, Libya, and Italy, in 
addition to the Egyptian Ambassador. End Comment.
