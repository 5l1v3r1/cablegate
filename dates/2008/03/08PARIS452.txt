(SBU)  In response to reftel message, French MFA Lebanon desk 
officer Thierry Vallat said March 11 that France's chief of 
mission in Beirut, Andre Parant, had been invited to the 
March 14 conference.  He stated that Parant was still 
consulting with other EU chiefs of mission as to whether he 
would attend himself or send someone else to represent the 
French embassy.  Vallat stressed, however, that Parant or 
someone else from the French embassy would attend.  He 
further indicated that Paris has no intention to send anyone 
else to Beirut for the conference.
