SUBJECT: DEMARCHE REQUEST: ATTENDANCE AND DONATIONS FOR 
JUNE 23 VIENNA CONFERENCE ON RECONSTRUCTION OF LEBANON'S 
NAHR AL-BARID REFUGEE CAMP 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see paragraph three. 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Department requests action addressees to urge 
host governments to send high-level representatives to the 
donors' conference to be held in Vienna June 23 and to 
contribute generously to the joint appeal by the Lebanese 
government, UNRWA, and the World Bank to reconstruct the Nahr 
al-Barid Palestinian refugee camp and revitalize the 
surrounding areas seriously impacted by last summer's battle 
against the terrorist group Fatah al-Islam.  End summary. 
 
OBJECTIVES 
---------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Posts are requested to approach host governments at 
the appropriate level to pursue the following objectives: 
-- Stress the importance of a successful Vienna conference to 
send a strong signal of international support for Lebanon's 
new post-Doha government.  Prime Minister Siniora himself 
will attend, indicating the importance of the conference to 
the Lebanese government. 
 
-- Note that the conference will: facilitate the return of 
Palestinian refugees displaced from their homes after the 
terrorist group Fatah al-Islam attacked the Lebanese army in 
summer 2007; help establish a new precedent for relations 
between Lebanese citizens and Palestinian refugees in Lebanon 
as well as for security arrangements inside all of Lebanon's 
refugee camps; set the stage for improved economic conditions 
for the refugees; and provide a much-needed boost to the new 
Lebanese government of President Sleiman and Prime Minister 
Siniora. 
 
-- Urge host governments to make generous pledges at the 
conference and solicit their current expectations for 
pledges.  (Note:  For camp reconstruction alone, the 
estimated need is $279 million over three years, including 
approximately $240 million for the first year.  We expect 
substantial funding will also be required to address 
surrounding Lebanese communities.) 
 
-- Urge host governments to send high-level representatives 
to the conference to underscore their support for Lebanon and 
its new government.  Solicit information about their expected 
delegations. 
 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) The June 23 international donors' conference on the 
reconstruction of the Nahr al-Barid (NAB) Palestinian refugee 
camp will facilitate the return of Palestinian refugees 
displaced from their homes during the violence prompted by 
the terrorist group Fatah al-Islam in summer 2007 and help 
establish a new precedent for relations between Lebanese 
citizens and Palestinian refugees in Lebanon. 
 
¶5. (SBU) At the conference, the Lebanese government, in 
partnership with UNRWA and the World Bank, will present a 
comprehensive plan to rebuild NAB, assist surrounding 
Lebanese communities, improve economic prospects for NAB 
residents, and maintain security inside the newly 
reconstructed camp to prevent another outbreak of violence. 
The Lebanese government has agreed with Palestinian leaders 
to station Lebanese police inside the reconstructed camp. 
Previously, the Palestinians themselves had been responsible 
for security inside all of Lebanon's refugee camps. 
 
¶6. (SBU) These important initiatives support the goal of the 
United States and international community to ensure that the 
Lebanese government is able to manage threats to stability in 
Lebanon and becomes the nation's sole guarantor of security, 
reinforcing the message that the government, not Hizballah

JUNE 23 VIENNA CONFERENCE ON RECONSTRUCTION OF LEBANON'S 
NAHR AL-BARID REFUGEE CA 
and other militias, can best provide for the needs of the 
Lebanese people and their Palestinian neighbors. 
 
¶7. (SBU) A successful conference will also provide a 
much-needed boost to the new Lebanese government of President 
Sleiman and Prime Minister Siniora.  The timing is important, 
as the role of the Lebanese government was brazenly 
challenged by the Hizballah-led opposition's violent attacks 
in May, 2008.  Generous pledges and high-level representation 
will send a strong signal to Hizballah, Syria, and their 
allies in Lebanon that the international community stands 
firmly in support of the legitimate Lebanese government. 
 
¶8. (SBU) We are finalizing a significant USG pledge which we 
plan to announce at the conference.  We are also finalizing 
participation, but expect to be represented by the U.S. 
Charge d'Affaires to Lebanon, Ambassador Michele Sison. 
 
¶9. (SBU) The Lebanese government has invited the foreign 
ministers of Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Belgium, Brazil, 
Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China, the Comoros, the Czech 
Republic, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Egypt, Finland, France, 
Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Iceland, Iraq, Ireland, 
Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Korea, Lithuania, Luxemburg, 
Malta, Mauratania, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, New 
Zealand, Norway, Oman, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, 
Russia, Spain, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, Sweden, 
Slovakia, Sudan, Switzerland, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, the 
United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United States, 
and Yemen, as well as representatives from the UN Relief and 
Works Agency, the World Bank, the United Nations, the 
Organization of the Islamic Conference, the Arab League, the 
Islamic Development Bank, and the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries.
