¶2. INL Managua has requested approval for the purchase of 20 
motorcycles and 3 Toyota Hi-Lux trucks for the Nicaraguan National 
Police's (NNP) Anti-Narcotics, Anti-Organized Crime, and Juvenile 
Affairs Units.  The purchases will total approximately $120,000; 
$60,000 for the 20 motorcycles and $60,000 for the 3 trucks.  These 
purchases are crQl to maintain the operational effectiveness of 
the NNP Units the USG works with in both direct narcotics 
interdiction efforts as well as in demand reduction activities. 
 
¶3.  Our end-use monitoring shows that the NNP has maintained 
previously donated vehicles in good condition and that they have 
supplied sufficient fuel for their vehicle fleet.  For this 
purchase, we are requesting Toyota trucks for the operational safety 
of the NNP officials who will use the vehicles.  U.S. trucks are 
rare in Nicaragua and would stand out in counter-narcotics 
operations.
