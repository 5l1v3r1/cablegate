Classified By: ISN/MTR ACTING DIRECTOR RALPH PALMIERO. 
REASON 1.4 (C). 
 
¶1.  (U) This is an action request. Embassy Helsinki, please 
see paragraph 4. 
 
¶2.  (S) On several occasions since 2006, we have raised our 
concerns with the government of Finland regarding the Finnish 
firm Vaisala Oy acting as a supplier to Iranian entities of 
concern (Refs).  In late 2007, we advised GOF officials that 
as of mid-September 2007, Vaisala Oy had plans to sell 
MAWS100 weather stations to Fan Pardazan.  We also reminded 
our Finnish interlocutors of information we shared with MTCR 
Partners in February 2006 indicating that Fan Pardazan may be 
affiliated with the Iranian UAV entity Qods Aeronautics 
Industries, a UNSCR-1747 designated entity.  Finnish 
officials indicated that the language the USG used to 
characterize Vaisala's activity was "too vague to permit the 
opening of an investigation, and hoped we could offer more 
specific information on the activity" (Ref D). 
 
¶3.  (S) Objectives: We now want to share new information with 
the GOF regarding Fan Pardazan's relationship with Qods 
Aeronautics Industries.  Specifically, we want to advise 
Finnish authorities that Fan Pardazan and Qods share the same 
mailing address in Tehran.  We hope this information will 
encourage the GOF to investigate and take measures to prevent 
Vaisala Oy from acting - even unwittingly - as a source of 
supply to Iranian entities of concern. 
 
¶4.  (U) Action Request: Department requests Embassy Helsinki 
approach appropriate host government officials to deliver the 
talking points in Paragraph 5 and report response.  Talking 
points may be left as a non-paper. 
 
¶5.  (S) Begin talking points/non-paper: 
 
(SECRET//REL FINLAND) 
 
-- In the spirit of our nonproliferation partnership, we 
would like to discuss a matter of proliferation concern. 
 
-- In December 2007, we advised you that the Finnish firm 
Vaisala Oy was planning to sell MAWS100 weather stations to 
Iran's Fan Pardazan and that Fan Pardazan may have been using 
the name TEM Company in an effort to procure the items. 
 
-- We also indicated that Fan Pardazan may be affiliated with 
the Iranian unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) entity, Qods (or 
Ghoods) Aviation (or Aeronautics) Industries (also known as 
Qods (Ghoods) Research Center). 
 
-- Qods Aeronautics Industries is designated in Annex I of 
UNSCR 1747 as an entity associated with the Iranian 
Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). 
 
-- We understand that your government is considering opening 
an investigation of this case and has asked for information 
that establishes a solid link between Fan Pardazan and Qods 
Aeronautics Industries. 
 
-- We now want to share with you additional information 
concerning the relationship between Fan Pardazan and Qods. 
 
-- Specifically, Fan Pardazan and Qods Aeronautics Industries 
share the same mailing address in Tehran: P.O. Box 
15875-1834, Tehran, Iran. 
 
-- We hope this information addresses your concerns, and that 
it proves useful in supporting your export control efforts 
and preventing entities in Finland from engaging in business 
dealings that may violate UNSCR 1747. 
 
-- We look forward to hearing the results of your inquiries 
and to continued cooperation on nonproliferation issues. 
 
END TALKING POINTS.
