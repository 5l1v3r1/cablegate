SUBJECT: EXBS: TURKEY ADVISORS MONTHLY REPORT- (MAY 2008) 
 
REF: A. ANKARA 950 
     ¶B. ANKARA 908 
 
¶1. (U) Summary:  Turkey continues to progress with proposed 
enhancements to their existing export controls and has 
submitted new proposed legislation to combine export control 
lists, form a Export Control Board (ECB), and improve 
licensing processes for dual-use and other sensitive items 
(ref a). MFA has indicated that with the ratification of the 
PUNE agreement by the US this month, they will begin 
preparations to implement the long awaited EXBS/NP Agreement. 
 EXBS Program continues to meet with GOT agencies to discuss 
proposed restructuring of Turkey's border management system 
under the Ministry of the Interior.  MFA is receptive to 
holding a joint EXBS Nonproliferation Seminar in Ankara at a 
mutually agreed date, once the EXBS NP Agreement is 
implemented.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) Completed Actions for the Reporting Period: 
 
¶A. Meetings During Recent Reporting Period by EXBS Advisor 
and Coordinator: 
 
1) (U) May 1 - Delivered the CTP, Inc. letter granting the 
GOT usage rights for ICP software on the UFT on-line servers 
for access by Turkish industry to MFA Head of Department for 
Nonproliferation and Disarmament Elif Ulgen and 
Undersecretariat of Foreign Trade (UFT) Head of Department 
Halit Akcaglayan.  Advisor advised Akcaglayan that EXBS is 
available to support further ICP development as needed.  UFT 
confirmed that the CTP letter is sufficient for them to use 
the ICP software on their official website and no other 
support is requested for ICP at this time.  Ulgen and 
Akcalayan disclosed the general content of the new Export 
Control Legislation (ref a), which is pending final review by 
the Prime Minister,s office and is expected to be submitted 
to Parliament in June for approval. 
 
2) (U) May 6 - EXBS Advisor raised the need to move ahead 
with the SLD hand-held and pager radiation detection training 
program as soon as possible with TNP Criminal Police 
Laboratory Bomb Disposal Unit Head of Section Cengiz Ozdemir. 
 Ozdemir agreed that the last two weeks of August would be 
the best time to hold this training and we agreed to move 
ahead with planning for Aug 18th - 29th, 2008 classes at the 
Golbasi training facility.  The hand-held radiation 
detectors, pagers, and radioactive training sources for this 
training are currently stored at the Golbasi site. 
 
3) (U) May 7 - Discussed Turkey's new Border Management 
Strategy and the National Action Plan for implementation (ref 
b) and TNP's role in developing the border management 
training programs with Turkish National Police (TNP) Deputy 
Director of Training Ahmet Karagoz.  Karagoz, who is in 
charge of training for all TNP officers, said the Ministry of 
Interior will be responsible for a new border management 
force of approximately 54,000 officers and that TNP will have 
the lead for establishing and managing a new Border 
Management Academy.  The current plan is to build a 
state-of-the-art Border Management Academy on the grounds of 
Ataturk's Farm, which is located just west of downtown 
Ankara.  This new facility will have a training capacity of 
500 students at a time and will provide specialized training 
to the expected 40,000 new border management officers who 
will serve within TNP, Customs, Coast Guard and other 
agencies with border security responsibilities.  TNP expects 
the new academy to be completed sometime in CY2010.  Advisor 
offered to work closely with the new border management 
program to provide access to US border training facilities 
and border experts, as agreed to by GOT and US agencies, 
which could provide training on border management related 
programs in the U.S.  Advisor asked about funding and legal 
authorities for this new border management organization. 
Karagoz noted that a Prime Minister,s decree signed in April 
2006 established this organization under the Ministry of 
Interior; he believed funding was still being coordinated 
between the GOT and EU.  We agreed to continue to meet as the 
GOT moves forward on this initiative. 
 
4) (SBU) May 13 - Reviewed the success of Z-Backscatter van 
training in April with Undersecretariat of Customs, 
Enforcement Head of Department Ender Gurleyik.  Gurleyik 
confirmed that the van would be moved to the Western border 
area sometime this month to begin covert scanning operations 
for the next 6-12 months while the Customs Port of Entry with 
Bulgaria is being modernized.  He agreed that late June would 
be a good time for his staff and EXBS team to visit this 
border area to see existing border operations and witness the 
van in an operational setting.  During this meeting, we 
agreed that the next equipment order from EXBS should contain 
one IONSCAN400 unit, 5 SABRE 4000 trace detectors, and 15 or 
more K910 Buster density testing units.  He expressed Turkish 
Customs appreciation for US assistance. 
 
5) (U) May 20 - Met again with MFA's Ulgen to discuss the 
status of the NP Agreement.  Ulgen said the Embassy will be 
notified by diplomatic note shortly after the 123/PUNE 
agreement enters into force.  She agreed it would be 
desirable to re-introduce the EXBS program and other 
nonproliferation programs again to GOT agencies.  Advisor 
discussed the possibility of holding a 2-3 day EXBS 
Nonproliferation Seminar in Ankara in late July 2008 to allow 
both US and GOT agencies to showcase program goals and 
capacities and provide an opportunity for US and Turkish 
officials to get reacquainted with each other.  She agreed 
that this would be valuable for both countries and would 
allow Turkey to "remove the old soil" and start with a fresh 
approach to nonproliferation cooperation between Turkey and 
US.  She agreed to proceed with notifying the relevant 
agencies in Ankara to see if the last week of July would be 
achievable for this conference.  She is amenable to using MFA 
conference facilities or a conference facility at the hotel 
where the US delegation will stay for this seminar (Note: 
Ulgen subsequently told us it would be difficult to ensure 
that the right people attend the seminar in late July, and 
suggested the US consider a date in the fall.  Ramadan begins 
September 1 and ends September 30.  We recommend exploring 
dates after Ramadan to maximize the effectiveness and 
productivity of the proposed conference.  End Note).
