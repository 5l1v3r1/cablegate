SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN PRE-LICENSE END USE CHECK ON 
APPLICATION 05-050105965 
 
¶1.  This is an action message.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2.  The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests AIT Taipei assistance in 
conducting a pre-license check for the export of missile 
components and technical data to Taiwan.  AIT Taipei is 
requested to complete this Blue Lantern check within 30 days. 
 Lack of response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending 
and future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3.  Reason for request: the Foreign Consignee has no 
licensing history with our office and is unknown to us. 
Internet searching found a website for the Foreign Consignee 
that describes its business (http://www.superwong.com.tw/), 
however, the company was also found listed on mainland China 
websites soliciting business transactions. 
 
¶4.  ACTION: Please visit the Foreign Consignee, Super Wong 
Industrial Company, and make appropriate inquiries to 
ascertain the bona fides of this company as a responsible 
recipient of USML commodities. The following questions are 
provided as suggested guidance. 
 
--What is the nature of Super Wong's business and who are its 
usual clients? 
 
--When was the company established and who are the owners? 
Are there other companies doing business at this same address? 
 
--Does Super Wong have an established relationship with the 
government of Taiwan as a supplier of defense articles? 
 
--Does Super Wong understand the restrictions on USML 
commodities, particularly the prohibition against 
re-transfers or re-exports without express USG authorization? 
 
--Has Super Wong had any commercial agreements or business 
dealings with Iran, North Korea, or China? 
 
AIT Taipei should also contact appropriate government of 
Taiwan officials and make inquires to confirm the bona fides 
of Super Wong Industrial Company and ascertain the existence 
of any derogatory information.  END ACTION.
