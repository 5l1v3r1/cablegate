¶1. (SBU) Summary: GoS authorities held a press conference on June 10 
to spotlight JEM human rights violations, and announce that all JEM 
"collaborators" will soon be charged and brought to trial. One young 
critic who came to prominence through his internet postings, Ibrahim 
Bagal, has gone underground, fearing extended detention, torture and 
trial.  End summary.

¶2. (SBU) On June 11, Poloff met with Ibrahim Abdalla Bagal, a 
prominent government critic, chairman of the Association of Darfur 
Students' Unions, and an accounting student at the University of 
Juba in Khartoum. An ethnic Zaghawa, Bagal has attracted notoriety 
through his posts on sudaneseonline.com, unrestrained in his 
criticism of the Government of Sudan (GoS). Following the May 10 JEM 
attacks, his web postings have lamented GoS targeting of Darfuri in 
Khartoum, and called on Sudanese civil society to organize against 
the detentions. Only 25, he already has been arrested by Sudanese 
authorities five times and bears scars about the arms and head from 
his torture. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) According to Bagal, officers from the National 
Intelligence and Security Services (NISS) have visited his home in 
Khartoum twice in the last month in order to detain him; on June 6, 
when Bagal himself was not at home, authorities detained his 
brothers. Four of Bagal's brothers, the youngest 18, were held for 
four days, and while interrogated and mildly beaten, they reportedly 
were not extensively tortured. Bagal himself fears torture should he 
be arrested, and displayed the accoutrements of a man gone 
underground - a toothbrush, a wallet flush with 50 pound bills, and 
four GSM SIM cards for his Nokia cellular phone.  Khartoum's 
close-knit Zaghawa community has managed to assist him in finding a 
new place to sleep each night. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Although unable to post online, Bagal has continued to 
conduct research on the heavy-handed GoS reaction against Darfuri 
living in Khartoum. Some recently released former detainees recount 
being forced to face a solid concrete wall, to then be hit sharply 
on the back of the head to break their noses on the wall without 
revealing the identity of their assailants.  Others have recounted 
their interrogators labeling them "slaves of Darfur" during 
beatings.  Additionally, Zaghawa households in the Um-Beda and 
Thawrah districts of Omdurman are reporting that GoS round-ups have 
detained at least one person from each household.

¶5. (SBU) On June 10, Poloff attended an ambassadorial-level meeting 
of the Sudan Advisory Council for Human Rights. Abdelmoneim Taha, 
Rapporteur of the GoS-affiliated council, began the meeting with a 
long litany of human rights abuses allegedly carried out by JEM 
leading up to, during, and following the May 10 attacks. Brother of 
GoS Vice President Ali Osman Taha, Taha accused the international 
community of adopting a double standard vis-`-vis JEM and GoS human 
rights violations.  As he had previously asserted in his meeting 
with Charge de Affaires Fernandez last month (Ref. A), Taha insisted 
that the Advisory Council has been monitoring the arrests from the 
beginning, and strenuously denied accusations of torture. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Jamal Osman Suleiman, representing the office of the 
Attorney General for Anti-Terrorism, announced that 105 suspects are 
still in custody under suspicion of assisting in the May 10 attacks, 
and 480 individuals have since been released. (Note: Information 
from human rights organizations in Khartoum indicates that 
Suleiman's quote of 105 detainees grossly undercounts the number of 
suspects in the custody of various GoS branches. End note.) Suleiman 
read a list of violations committed by JEM under various articles of 
the Sudanese Anti-Terror Act of 2001, including but not limited to: 
undermining the constitution, inciting conflict, killing civilians, 
and publishing false information. Colonel Mustafa Ibrahim of the 
Sudanese Armed Forces said that although the Geneva Convention gives 
the military the right to try detained JEM supporters in military 
tribunals, all detainees will face trial in civilian courts. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Legal advocates in Khartoum doubt the possibility of free, 
fair and open trials, pointing out that the Sudanese Anti-Terrorism 
Act of 2001 allows the GoS to conduct trials in closed courts.

Khartoum-based attorneys with the Darfur Bar Association have 
submitted several petitions to defend the accused, but the Ministry 
of Justice has not yet answered their pleas. Discouragingly, the 
GoS-controlled Sudanese Bar Association has already volunteered to 
provide defense lawyers should the trials be held in civilian 
courts.  These attorneys are sure to show little interest in 
actually defending their clients.

¶11. (SBU) With at least one critic on the run, possibly thousands 
jailed (Ref. D), and hundreds facing trial on unknown charges, the 
human rights situation in Khartoum continues to deteriorate. 
Historically calm in the midst of disorder on the periphery of the 
nation, Khartoum is still reeling from the shock of the JEM attacks, 
and Darfuris here are aware they will continue to make convenient 
targets for GoS anger. Post will continue to monitor the situation 
as the detainees make their way through the legal system.
