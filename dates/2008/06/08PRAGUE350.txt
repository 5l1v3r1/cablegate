(SBU) Czech MFA Lebanon desk officer, Sylva Pavlasova, stated 
that MFA Middle East and North Africa Department Director, 
Josef Rychtar, will attend the June 23 Vienna conference on 
reconstruction of Lebanon's Nahr al-Barid Palestinian refugee 
camp.  She noted that the Czechs responded last summer when 
Lebanon made its first plea for assistance and contributed 
roughly 50,000 USD.  This was in addition to its annual 
contribution to the UNRWA, which totaled 2M Czech crowns 
(125,000 USD) in 2007.  While the Czechs have not finalized 
their contribution for the Nahr al-Barid camp this year, 
Pavlasova anticipates that the GOCR contribution will be in 
the neighborhood of 20,000-30,000 USD.
