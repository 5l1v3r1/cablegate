SUBJECT: GAZA CROSSINGS CLOSED AFTER QASSAM STRIKES; 
PALESTINIAN SHOT NEAR KHAN YUNIS 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Palestinian press report an 80-year-old farmer was 
shot and seriously injured by IDF fire early June 25, 500 
meters from the perimeter fence east of Khan Yunis.  There 
were no Qassam rockets or mortars fired from Gaza as of 1600 
local on June 25. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) UN, Palestinian and NGO contacts report that all 
Gaza Strip crossings were closed for humanitarian and 
commercial goods on June 25.  Erez crossing was open to 
limited passenger traffic pre-arranged with the GOI. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri told local press 
that "the closure by the occupation is a violation of the 
deal for calm in Gaza," after the Israeli Defense Ministry 
ordered Gaza's crossings closed in response to PIJ rocket 
fire on June 24.  Hamas leaders condemned the IDF killings of 
PIJ and Hamas militants in the Nablus area on June 24, and 
called for "resistance to Israeli atrocities" in the West 
Bank, but urged Palestinians in Gaza to exercise restraint 
and abide by the ceasefire and "national consensus of the 
truce."  Senior Hamas leader Khalil al-Haya told local press 
that Hamas "remains fully committed to a ceasefire and is 
working to implement calm, but will not act as police 
securing the occupation's border," and "will not hold a rifle 
in the face of resistance fighters."  Other Hamas spokesmen 
said Hamas is pressuring PIJ and other militant groups to 
abide by the ceasefire, and that Hamas leader Sa'id Siyam met 
with militant faction chiefs to persuade them to refrain from 
launching attacks against Israel from Gaza.
