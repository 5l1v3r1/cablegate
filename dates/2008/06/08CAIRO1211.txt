SUBJECT: EGYPT SUPPORTS SECRETARIAT ON UN SYSTEM OF

REF: SECSTATE 51372 
 
We urged MFA Counselor for UN Affairs Yasser Naggar on June 
12 to consider that certain elements of the comprehensive 
reforms proposed by the UN Secretary General concerning the 
mechanism for staff to bring employment-based grievances 
should not be implemented, and left reftel non-paper on the 
USG position.  Naggar responded that he would pass the points 
to the Egyptian delegation in New York, but that the GOE 
supports the UN Secretariat's plan to fix a "system that 
doesn't work."  "This is a priority for us," he said, noting 
that the GOE delegation to the 5th Committee had been 
instructed to expedite these reforms to get them up and 
running by January 2009.  However, he added that the GOE is 
ready to coordinate with the USG and others to "streamline" 
the budget.
