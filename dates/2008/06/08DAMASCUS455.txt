¶1.  SUMMARY: In less than a year, Syrian program alumni from two 
successful International Visitor Leadership Programs (IVLPs) have 
generated positive change in healthcare in Syria since their return. 
 A FY07 single country program on nursing education (ref A) inspired 
the seven participants to lobby doctors' organizations and the 
Ministry of Health for better training and more respect.  The FY08 
regional IVLP on breast cancer awareness (ref B) not only led 
directly to the first ever march for breast cancer in Syria (ref C) 
but also to gatherings around the country at which survivors 
publicly advocate for awareness and early detection.  Post actively 
supports these activities and will use its FY09 program resources to 
further support these efforts.  END SUMMARY.

Nurses Form Alliance with U.S. Educated Doctors 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶2.  From September 8-29, 2007, seven Syrian nurses drawn from 
private hospitals in Syria traveled on a single-country IVLP focused 
on nursing education.  Upon their return, the nurses immediately 
reached out to the Ministries of Health (MoH) and Higher Education 
to share the information gained during their program.  One of the 
nurses presented a proposal to the Syrian Minister of Health to 
establish a 911-like emergency call network.  The MoH is currently 
studying the proposal. 
 
¶3.  In November 2007, the nurses worked with both PD Damascus and 
the Al-Andalos Private Hospital to organize a panel discussion 
during which they talked about their U.S. experience with 25 nurses 
and U.S. graduate physicians.  The Head of the Syrian American 
Medical Association (SAMA) attended and as a result agreed to extend 
membership to nurses and to support their efforts to improve nursing 
education and training. 
 
¶4.  Note: Syria boasts a large number of U.S. trained doctors, who 
play an active and influential role in Syrian society.  Nursing 
education is not on par with the level of medical training for 
doctors, and these doctors have a vested interest in supporting 
better nursing.  End note. 
 
¶5.  The connection with SAMA proved invaluable. In May 2008, the 
same group of IVP alumni nurses conducted a two-day training 
workshop at the Assad University Hospital, Damascus University, 
under the patronage of the Minister of Higher Education and in 
coordination with SAMA.  Four hundred nurses attended.

Breast Cancer: Awareness, Detection, Survival 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  Two members in the Syrian Society for Breast Cancer participated 
in the IVLP on breast cancer awareness October 27-November 19, 2007. 
 The program energized and inspired the two women, who upon their 
return to Syria staged the first-ever march for breast cancer 
awareness and detection in Syria on April 12, 2008.  They have also 
organized panel discussions in three separate Syrian cities 
(Damascus, Tartous, and Zabadani) to talk about the importance of 
awareness and early detection.  One of the IVLP participants, a 
survivor, has used these forums to speak publicly and personally 
about her battle with the disease.  She told PDOff she would have 
never dared to speak in such a way before her trip to the States. 
 
¶7. Inspired by similar programs in the United States, the two IVP 
alumni worked with their organization and the Syrian Ministry of 
Health to start a mobile mammography program.  The "mammogram 
mobile" will travel to rural areas to bring screening to women who 
would otherwise not have access to a hospital or clinic.  Mammograms 
will be offered at low or no-cost.  The Syrian Breast Cancer society 
is also working with the MoH to offer free mammograms two days a 
month at hospitals and clinics in Damascus and other major cities.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶8.  Healthcare is a significent area of activity for civil society 
in Syria.  Due to the presence of a large U.S.-trained medical 
community with high-level connections to the Syrian regime, Embassy 
Damascus finds that there is interest, funding, and a strong 
incentive to improve healthcare and support Syrian NGOs working in 
this field.  Post plans to program a healthcare speaker in FY2009 as 
well as an additional SCP, and will nominate Syrian participants for 
FY2009 IVLPs on healthcare-related topics.
