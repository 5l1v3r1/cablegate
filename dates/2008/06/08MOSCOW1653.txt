(U) Post has been unable to confirm the bona fides of reftel 
entities.  Andrey Firsov, Deputy Director of foreign consignee JSC 
Instrument Plant TENZOR, told us June 6 he would rather lose the 
contract than answer our "strange questions" related to reftel 
pre-license check.  Yelena Kulakova, Senior Specialist of the 
end-user Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy (RosAtom), also declined 
to provide us with information regarding this case.  ESTOff 
contacted his interlocutors at RosAtom as well, but no answer was 
forthcoming.
