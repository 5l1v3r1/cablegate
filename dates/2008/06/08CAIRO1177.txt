¶1.  (U) Summary: The northern Egyptian coastal town of Burg 
al-Burullus was the site of a large June 7 impromptu protest 
against the provincial governor's recent decision to halt the 
distribution of subsidized flour in favor of subsidized bread 
distribution. Police sent to disperse the demonstrators used 
force and the protesters forcibly retaliated, causing 
injuries on both sides. End summary. 
 
¶2.  (U) On June 7, thousands of Egyptian demonstrators 
clashed with police to protest a decision by government 
authorities to end distribution of flour rations in the 
fishing village of Burg al-Burullus in the Kafr Al-Shaykh 
governate. According to press reports, 10,000 to 15,000 
demonstrators blocked a main road for several hours with 
burning tires in an attempt to persuade the governor to 
change his decision. In comments to journalists, the area's 
MP, Hamdin Sabahi, who represents the not-yet-licensed 
"Karama" (Dignity) Party, said, "most inhabitants in the 
village are fishermen, and they are used to buying flour, 
baking it and taking it with them on long trips at sea. This 
is part of their culture and daily practice. They do not eat 
baked bread. Rather, they prefer to buy flour." Al-Jazirah 
reported that the governor hoped that his decision would end 
the resale of subsidized flour on the black market. However, 
fishermen apparently perceived it as a lack of concern for 
their need to spend weeks at a time at sea. 
 
¶3. (U) The protesters reportedly refused to disperse even 
after police released tear-gas canisters into the crowd, 
pelting police officials and security vehicles with stones. 
Some 15 of the demonstrators were reportedly admitted to the 
hospital after being overcome by tear-gas. One security 
source told journalists that rubber bullets had been fired at 
the crowd. 72 people were reportedly detained by police. Our 
security contacts confirmed that 20 policemen were injured. 
 
¶4. (U) On June 8, Al-Jazirah reported that the governor and 
MPs of Kafr Al-Shaykh governate had reached a compromise, 
maintaining the decision of the governor (canceling the 
ration of subsidized flour granted to each family), but 
committing to providing ample bread at subsidized prices. 
According to press reports, many residents are skeptical of 
the compromise and are concerned that they will not receive 
enough to eat. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: The Burg al-Burullus protest is notable 
both for its reportedly large size, and as an indicator that 
tensions continue to simmer within the economically stretched 
Egyptian populace over the sensitive issue of bread.
