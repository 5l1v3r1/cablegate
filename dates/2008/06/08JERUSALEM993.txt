Al-Quds' front page leads with an architect's rendering of a new 
Israeli neighborhood to be built in East Jerusalem's Ras al-Amud, 
near the Dome of the Rock mosque.  According to Al-Quds, the 
construction is part of the Israeli, "campaign to Judanize the area 
around the mosque."  According to the dailies, an unnamed 
Palestinian Authority official criticized the plan and stated that 
it will, "negatively affect" the peace process.  The official also 
invited observers to note the timing of the news just before the 
visit of Secretary Rice to the region.  In related news, the front 
pages highlight that, "Israeli authorities demolished three houses 
in the Jerusalem area on June 10 because they lacked building 
permits." 
 
Front pages run a June 10 interview with Palestinian Premier Fayyad. 
 Al-Quds reports Fayyad commenting that, "the siege on Gaza is a 
'huge headache' and we are making every effort to end it."  Al-Ayyam 
reports that Fayyad states, "the priority is to halt settlement 
activity," adding that, "reaching an agreement will not be possible 
this year."  Al-Hayat Al-Jadida focuses on Fayyad's call to, "form a 
'temporary' national government that will include all parties until 
early elections are held."  All papers note that Fayyad explained 
that if tax revenues are transferred by the Israelis to the 
Palestinian Authority, salaries for May will be paid to 150,000 
civil servants. 
 
In foreign assistance news, the dailies note that the EU approved 23 
million Euros in direct aid to the Palestinian Authority which was 
used on June 10 to pay pensions and salaries to 73,000 Palestinians. 
 Papers also carry positive coverage of a June 10 agreement between 
Palestinian Premier Fayyad and the World Bank for $40 million of 
assistance to the Palestinian Authority. 
 
Headlines in all dailies announce that Egypt will "soon" host talks 
among Palestinian parties.  The dailies quote Hamas leader Khaled 
Masha'al confirming that Hamas representatives recently met with 
other Palestinian factions in Damascus to discuss Palestinian 
reconciliation.  Meanwhile, reporting about a possible Israeli 
military operation in the Gaza Strip continues to capture headlines. 
 Papers note that the Israeli Government is still discussing the 
option.  Related front page coverage reports that three "Palestinian 
activists" were killed in two separate Israeli operations targeting 
Gaza City on June 10.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
¶1. Al-Ayyam carries an op-ed by veteran columnist Hamada Faranah 
entitled, "Abu Mazen [Abbas] will stay his course" (6/11): "...The 
power of Abu Mazen lies in the clarity of his positions regarding 
what he considers to be in the true interest of his people. 
Therefore, he did not hesitate to state that he wants Hamas to be a 
partner in Palestinian decision making... Abu Mazen wants Hamas to 
play a constructive role [in supporting the goals of] the 
Palestinians.  He is also trying to rescue it from its extreme 
leadership, because as he said, it is a major part of the 
Palestinian people and many people trust it..." 
¶2. Izzat Daraghmah commented in official Al-Hayat Al-Jadida under 
the title, "President [Abbas'] initiative is a victory for the 
[Palestinian] People," (6/11): "No one can disparage the integrity 
and good intentions of President Abbas in his attempt to restore the 
 
JERUSALEM 00000993  002 OF 002 
 
 
situation in Gaza to the time before June of last year.  Likewise, 
no one can deny that the President's initiative [for national 
reconciliation with Hamas] has angered the American administration 
and leaders of the Israeli occupation....  What is needed now from 
everyone is resistance to American and Israeli pressure as well as 
to the attempts by any parties and countries... that only care about 
their own interests and agendas.  Only then will the Palestinian 
people breathe a sigh of relief and feel hopeful about the success 
of dialogue and reconciliation among [the Palestinian factions.]"
