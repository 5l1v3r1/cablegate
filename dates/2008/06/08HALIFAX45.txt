INTRODUCTION/SUMMARY: 
===================== 
 
¶1.  This cable is a "primer" on the status of significant 
operating and future energy projects in Atlantic Canada.  The 
Atlantic Provinces Economic Council (APEC), a regional think 
tank, reported in March 2008 that actual and proposed new 
investment in these projects had reached the level of $42 
billion.  Unlike the 1990s, however, today's investments are 
focused less on offshore developments and more on a mixture of 
onshore projects such as Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) facilities, 
oil refineries, pipelines, hydro and nuclear power generation, 
and other forms of renewable energy.  What has not changed over 
the years is the overarching importance of the U.S. northeast 
energy market.  New England is the market for approximately 85 
percent of Atlantic Canada's international energy exports, which 
totaled $16.6 billion in 2007. (The remaining 15 percent is 
divided among a number of other countries, none of which would 
be considered a prime secondary market.)  Future demand in New 
England is also the driving force behind several new and 
proposed energy projects throughout the region.

and private European entrepreneurs. 
        --Status:  Planned/Proposed 
        --Start-up Date: 2011 
        --Production:  300,000 barrels per day 
        --Cost:  $5 Billion 
        --Details:  The development plan calls for the facility to 
process heavy sour crude at the site, a deepwater, ice-free port 
near the province's existing oil industry infrastructure on 
Placentia Bay. 
        --Web Address:  http://www.nlrefining.com/ 
        --Latest Developments:  The federal government approved 
the development plan in April 2008.  However, the developers 
have not yet contracted with partners and lenders for the 
project.

II.  Hydroelectric Power 
======================== 
 
  ¶A. UPPER CHURCHILL 
  ------------------ 
 
        --Type:  Power Generation 
        --Location:  Newfoundland-Labrador; Churchill River, 
Labrador 
        --Owner/Operator:  The Churchill River Power Project is a 
joint initiative of the provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador 
and Quebec and their respective hydroelectric utilities, Hydro 
Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro. 
        --Status:  Producing/Complete 
 
HALIFAX 00000045  007.2 OF 008 
 
 
        --Start-up Date: Operating since 1971 
        --Production:  5,428 MW 
        --Details:  The massive hydroelectric potential of the 
falls was realized for decades, but it was not until the 
completion of the Quebec, North Shore and Labrador Railway in 
1954 and the development of long-distance electric-power 
transmission technology by Hydro-Quebec that exploitation became 
feasible.  Complex development negotiations between the 
governments of Newfoundland and Quebec (through which the power 
would have to pass) were not completed until 1969. The project 
took nine years to build, employed more than 30,000 people and 
cost $950 million. The first units began transmitting December 
1971; the eleventh and final unit went into service in 1974. 
        --Web Address:  www.nlh.nl.ca 
        --Latest Developments:  The sales contract between the 
governments of Newfoundland-Labrador and Quebec for the 
Churchill power is a decades-long, contentious political issue. 
Under the terms of the contract, which does not expire until 
2041, the price that Quebec pays for the Churchill power is 
fixed at 1969 prices.  With the dramatic rise in energy costs 
over the years, Hydro-Quebec has reaped substantial profits from 
the resale of Churchill Falls power.  The Government of 
Newfoundland-Labrador has tried unsuccessfully to have the terms 
amended and this issue is a factor in the current negotiations 
over development of the Lower Churchill River. 
 
  ¶B.  LOWER CHURCHILL PROJECT 
  --------------------------- 
 
        --Location:  Newfoundland-Labrador; Churchill River, 
Labrador 
        --Owner/Operator:  Owned and managed by the Churchill 
Falls Corporation, 51% owned by the Government of 
Newfoundland-Labrador and 49% by the Government of Canada. 
        --Status:  Planned/Proposed 
        --Start-up Date: Undetermined 
        --Production:  2,800 megawatts of power (enough to power 
1.5 million homes) 
        --Cost:  $6-9 billion 
        --Details:  The existing 5,428 MW Churchill Falls 
generating station, which began producing power in 1971, 
harnesses about 65 per cent of the potential generating capacity 
of the Churchill River.  The remaining 35 per cent is located at 
two sites on the lower Churchill River, known as the Lower 
Churchill Project. These sites are considered two of the best 
undeveloped hydroelectric sites in North America: Gull Island, 
located 140 miles downstream from the existing Churchill Falls 
Generating Station; and Muskrat Falls, located 38 miles 
downstream from Gull Island. 
        --Web Address:  http://www.lowerchurchillproject.ca 
        --Latest Developments:  Should the project go ahead, there 
will be a nine-year construction period which would begin at 
Gull Island followed by first power five years later. 
Construction of the Muskrat Falls would be started three years 
after the start of the Gull Island construction.  A major 
decision that has yet to be made is how to transmit the power to 
market:  via an overland route through Quebec or via undersea 
cables to the Island of Newfoundland and through New Brunswick 
or Nova Scotia.  Environmental impacts and an agreement with the 
Innu Nation are other critical factors.

III.  Nuclear Power 
=================== 
 
  ¶A. POINT LEPREAU GENERATING STATION 
  ----------------------------------- 
 
        --Location:  New Brunswick; Point Lepreau 
        --Owner/Operator:  Owned and operated by the New Brunswick 
Power Nuclear Corporation, a subsidiary of the 
provincially-owned New Brunswick Power Corporation 
        --Status:  Shutdown for refit until September 2009 
        --Start-up Date: Operating since 1983 
        --Production:  capacity of 635 MW 
        --Details:  Point Lepreau has one nuclear reactor, a 
CANDU-6 unit, with net capacity of 635 MW. It was the first 
CANDU-6 to be licensed for operation and to begin commercial 
operation.  The unit supplies about 30% of the energy consumed 
in the province. 
        --Web Address:  http://nuclear.nbpower.com/en/default.aspx 
        --Latest Developments:  Point Lepreau is currently 
shutdown for a $1.4 billion refit, (with a September 2009 target 
for completion) which will extend the facility's life to 2032. 
 
  ¶B. 2ND LEPREAU STATION 
  ---------------------- 
 
 
HALIFAX 00000045  008.2 OF 008 
 
 
        --Location:  New Brunswick; Point Lepreau 
        --Owner/Operator:  The facility would be owned and 
operated by the New Brunswick Power Nuclear Corporation, a 
subsidiary of the provincially-owned New Brunswick Power 
Corporation. 
        --Status:  Under Consideration 
        --Start-up Date: Undetermined 
        --Production:  1,100 megawatts 
        --Cost:  $4-5 billion 
        --Details:  This project would involve building a new 
reactor to complement the existing reactor at the Point Lepreau 
site.  An independent consulting firm said in February 2008 that 
this project could be economically viable if the proponents 
could confirm domestic and U.S. markets.  However, LNG and 
natural gas generation facilities could be major competitors for 
a second plant. 
        --Web Address:  http://www.gnb.ca/0085/Lepreau-e.asp 
        --Latest Developments:  As of June 2008, the New Brunswick 
Provincial government had not made a final decision to proceed 
with the project.

IV.  Other Projects 
=================== 
 
  ¶A.  NEW BRUNSWICK-MAINE INTERNATIONAL POWER LINE 
  --------------------------------------------- --- 
 
        --Type:  Electricity Transmission 
        --Location:  Point Lepreau, New Brunswick to Orrington, 
Maine 
        --Owner/Operator:  A joint development between NB Power 
Transmission (a subsidiary of provincially-owned New Brunswick 
Power) and Bangor Hydro (a subsidiary of Emera of Halifax). 
        --Status:  Producing/Complete 
        --Start-up Date: Operating since December 2007 
        --Production:  345 Kilovolts 
        --Details:  This is the second international transmission 
line from New Brunswick to Maine. 
        --Web Address:  http://transmission.nbpower.com/en/ 
        intlpowerline/intlpowerline.aspx 
        --Latest Developments:  NB Power is involved in a dispute 
with New England utilities over tariffs on the line which has 
left the transmission line underutilized. 
 
¶B.      RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS 
----------------------------- 
 
Tidal power is a growing area of interest in Nova Scotia and New 
Brunswick.  One Nova Scotia company, Minas Basin Pulp and Power, 
will be building a $12 million plant designed to harness the 
tides of the Bay of Fundy.  Three other separate groups will 
spend $12-15 million each testing their own tidal turbines at 
this facility, the results of which will be used to evaluate the 
potential for a full scale commercial tidal generating facility. 
 In other renewable energy projects, there are numerous wind 
farms throughout the region that are nearing completion over the 
next two-three years.  The average size is approximately 35 MW.
