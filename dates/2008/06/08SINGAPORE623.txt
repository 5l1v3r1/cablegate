¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Commercial Officer Todd Avery (CO) and ICE Special 
Agent Chris Matarelli (ICE-SA) conducted a post 
shipment-verification (PSV) at St. Talent Enterprise, No. 63 
Hillview Ave, #10-08 Lam Soon Industrial Building, Singapore.  The 
items in question were covered in two shipments.  Shipment 1 
included B1323S, B-coil Antenna, 132-174 MHz and associated mounting 
hardware exported to St. Talent on or about October 10, 2007 and 
valued at USD 59,894.  Shipment 2 included FGM4507 (ENG) 450-460 7dB 
Heavy Duty Base Antenna and associated mounting hardware.  Shipment 
2 was ordered April 9, 2008 and is currently detained by U.S. 
Customs. Value of the order is USD 14,545.  Although no license was 
issued for this transaction, these items are controlled by the 
Department's Export Administration Regulations.  The exporter was 
Laird Technologies, 1751 Wilkening Court, Schaumburg, I 60173, 
Contact: Bruce Juhl at (847) 839-6989. 
 
¶3. On Thursday, May 29, 2008, Comm. attach Todd Avery And Customs 
Enforcement Representative Christopher Matarelli, Immigration And 
Customs Enforcement, U.S. Department Of Homeland Security visited 
Saint Talent Enterprise, at their premises in a typical Singapore 
industrial building, Add: 63 Hillview Avenue, #10-08 Lam Soon 
Industrial Building Singapore 669569. Emboffs met with the sole 
proprietor of St. Talent, Mr. Jason SU Eng Kai on the U.S. export 
licensing procedures and requirements.  Mr. Su indicated that he 
started his company over 5 years ago to trade telecommunications 
equipment primarily to the fishing and maritime sector. 
 
¶4. Mr. Su confirmed that he placed both orders with Laird through 
their local representative, Aspiring International.  Mr. Su 
identified John Wilkinson of Aspiring as his point of contact.  Mr. 
Su indicated that these are the first two orders he has placed with 
Aspiring and the first time he has ordered American equipment.  Mr. 
Su indicated he was not familiar with U.S. Export Control 
regulations. 
 
¶5. Mr. Su confirmed that Shipment 1 was placed on behalf of the ICI 
Iran Communications Industries, Pasdaran Ave. Adasieh St. P.O. Box 
19575-131, Tehran, Iran.  Mr. Su shared with EmbOffs trade 
documentation and bank records to verify the completion of the 
transaction.  According to Mr. Su, Shipment 1 was a consolidated 
shipment with another unrelated order from the U.S.  The items in 
question were transshipped directly to the end-user from a bonded 
warehouse and did not clear customs in Singapore.  ICI is a regular 
customer of St. Talent, who has been supplying them with 
telecommunications equipment for three to four years.  Mr. Su 
indicated that this is the first time he has ordered equipment from 
the U.S. for ICI. 
 
¶6. Shipment 2 was placed with Aspiring on or about April 9, 2008 for 
resale to ANA Shipping and Trading of the Maldives.  Mr. Su shared 
order documentation with EmbOffs and bank information that showed 
the purchase.  ANA is a long-time customer of St. Talent that dates 
back to Mr. Su's previous career as a shipping agent.  Mr. Su has 
received nearly 20 orders from ANA over the years. 
 
¶7.  Mr. Su stated that both Shipment 1 and Shipment 2 consisted of 
base station antennas used in VHF communications.  The coil antennas 
of Shipment 1 can be installed on ships while the antennas of 
Shipment 2 are solely for land-based installation.  Mr. Su stated 
that he did not know of the ultimate disposition of any of the 
items. 
 
¶8.  Mr. Su was cooperative and open in providing information and 
documentation concerning the orders.  St. Talent appears to be a 
legitimate, if small, trading company dealing in telecommunications 
equipment, primarily for the maritime and fishing industries.
