¶1. Econoff requested on June 16 an update from Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs International Organizations Director Azad 
Belfort on the status of Haiti's 60-Day Report required by 
UNSCR 1803.  Belfort said he requested mid-May responses from 
the Prime Minister's office, the National Palace and the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs addressing the Government of 
Haiti's (GoH) efforts to implement Iran Sanctions.  To date, 
he has received no response. 
 
¶2. Belfort said the absence of a Prime Minister and the 
resulting political impasse have added to delays in 
coordinating between various government bodies.  While he 
could not confirm a date when the report would be prepared, 
he suggested the most expeditious approach would be for the 
MFA to prepare a draft report for comment by other GoH 
institutions.  Belfort said he would inform econoff once the 
report has been prepared, but was not optimistic it would be 
done in short order.
