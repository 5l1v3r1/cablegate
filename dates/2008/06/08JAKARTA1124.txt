REF: STATE 50722 
 
¶1.  Post has convinced seven television stations with a total 
estimated viewership of 72 million to run the Harrison Ford public 
service announcements (PSAs) on wildlife trafficking during June. 
Six Indonesian television stations with a total viewership of 58 
million (public television TVRI, and the privately run RCTI, Global 
TV, Metro TV, ANTV, TPI), and youth radio station Trax FM (with a 
listenership of 500,000) have been running the PSAs from June 5 
through June 13 at various time slots.  Another private television 
station, Indosiar (with a viewership of 13 million) and three radio 
stations (public radio RRI, leading youth channel Prambors, and 
private radio news agency KBR 68H, with a total listenership of 32 
million), have committed to running the PSAs from June 12 through 
June 19 at various time slots. 
 
¶2.  Cinema XXI, Indonesia's largest cinema chain, has been running 
the PSAs in theaters alongside the new Indiana Jones movie in 10 
major Jakarta theaters since June 2.  In addition, two national 
daily newspapers ran a customized version of the op-ed piece, placed 
under the USAID Mission Director's signature, as a news item: Media 
Indonesia (on June 5) and Suara Pembaruan (on June 6). 
 
¶3.  Amconsulate Surabaya screened the PSAs on June 5 at the American 
Corner at Airlangga University before showing the film, "March of 
the Penguins."  Two local newspapers reported the activity. 
Amconsulate Surabaya also intends to place the PSAs on two 
television stations in East Java: JTV and SBO TV.
