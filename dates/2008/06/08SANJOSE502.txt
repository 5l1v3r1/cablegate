REF: STATE 54213 
 
¶1. We delivered reftel talking points, including paragraph 38 
points for Costa Rica, and non-paper to the MFA on May 28. On 
June 9, we followed up with Randolph Coto, MFA Department 
Head for International Organizations, Disarmament and 
Terrorism. 
 
¶2. On June 9, Coto responded by email that he was very 
familiar with the Convention as he was part of the conference 
delegation that negotiated it in Vienna in 1997. He told us 
that his office's recommendation was to sign and ratify the 
CSC. He indicated, however, that due to the procedures to be 
followed and the background of the issue, along with the fact 
that Costa Rica has other legislative priorities at this 
moment, he doubted that ratification would be possible in the 
short term. He said that he would speak to Jorge Aguilar in 
the MFA's Office of Treaties to explore possibilities, 
however. 
 
¶3. We asked Coto to keep us informed. We will inform if/when 
we receive new information.
