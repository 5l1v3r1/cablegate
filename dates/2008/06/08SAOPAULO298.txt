Loaded Gun 
 
Article in center-right O Estado de S.Paulo (6/12) says: "Among the 
classified documents obtained by newspaper Valor under the Freedom 
of Information Act...there is a cable from Secretary of State 
Condoleezza Rice to the U.S. Embassy in Brasilia reporting that 'in 
response to the Secretary's comment that Brazil needs to send a 
frank message to Venezuelan President Chavez, [former Chief of Staff 
Jos] Dirceu stated that he had already counseled Chavez on the need 
to be more careful in his rhetoric (telling Chavez he was playing 
with a 'loaded gun').' Chavez has, belatedly, taken Lula's 
advice.... Chavez now says that the Farc should abandon the 
guerilla. Chavez's less belligerent position offers potential for a 
very positive diplomatic outcome: the release of hostages that have 
been suffering at the hands of the Farc for a long time, like Ingrid 
Betancourt. It is a sign of hope."
