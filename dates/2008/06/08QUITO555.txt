¶1.  (U) The following is a weekly economic update for Ecuador that 
reports notable developments that are not reported by individual 
cables. 
 
More on GOE Efforts to Review Macroeconomic Data 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶2. (U) The Central Bank of Ecuador (CB) invited three technicians 
from the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean 
(ECLAC) to review its economic indicators.  The ECLAC team is 
scheduled to arrive the last week of June. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  According to Embassy Buenos Aires, we understand that 
Correa's Argentine economic advisor (which he announced in his 
weekly radio address - ref a) is a colleague who studied with Correa 
in the U.S. and who currently works in the Argentine Central Bank's 
economic studies department.   The Argentine colleague has not yet 
decided whether he would take a leave of absence in order to advise 
the GOE for a year or more. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The Ministry of Finance requested that the International 
Monetary Fund provide it assistance to improve its ability to review 
macroeconomic data.  A small assessment team was in Ecuador the week 
of June 16, to lay the ground work for a larger team that would come 
later. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Mateo Villalba, advisor to the Under Secretary of 
Macroeconomic Consistency in the Ministry of Finance, outlined for 
econoffs the main concern with the Central Bank's GDP data.  Without 
going into much detail, he said that the methodology used by the 
Central Bank results in very volatile petroleum production 
calculations.  In some years that exaggerates the upward trend in 
growth, and other years it suppresses the overall growth rate.  He 
said that in 2007 the non-petroleum sectors grew at a good, steady 
rate but that performance was pulled down by declining petroleum 
production.  He also mentioned problems with the Central Bank's 
methodology to assess petroleum refining, which shows up lost value, 
based on the difference between international prices for crude and 
controlled domestic prices for refined products.  Villalba said that 
Central Bank's methodology for assessing the petroleum sectors needs 
to be fixed, but allowed that that will take time and would not have 
a large impact on the overall GDP growth rate. 
 
Repsol Files for International Arbitration 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶6. (U) On June 9, the Spanish oil company Repsol filed for 
arbitration at the World Bank's International Centre for the 
Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).  Repsol is the partner of 
U.S. oil company Murphy, which filed for arbitration in April.  Like 
the other foreign oil companies that have filed for arbitration, 
Repsol's reason for filing was the law that requires that oil 
companies provide the government with a share of "extraordinary 
revenues" (first 50%, and subsequently raised to 99%).  Federico 
Cruz, Repsol's spokesman in Ecuador, said that the company would 
prefer to reach a negotiated agreement with the GOE and stay in the 
country. 
 
¶7. (U) Ecuador has the second largest number of arbitration cases at 
the ICSID, after Argentina. 
 
Mining Developments 
------------------- 
 
¶8. (U) On June 9, the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum implemented 
articles 2 and 6 of the mining mandate, which froze almost all 
mining exploration in the country and revoked 1,138 mining 
concessions (ref. B).  Two million hectares are to be returned to 
the state out of 4.5 million hectares that were covered by mining 
concessions.   According to the GOE, concessions that did not pay 
for environmental permits and concessions that were up for approval 
in April 2008 are being revoked.  Ten companies will lose their 
concessions:  All Metals Mineria, Atlas Moly S.A., Eguiguren Aryans 
Carlos Arturo, Dai Zhou Xiaohui, Compania Minera Mariana, Sierramin, 
Channel Mining Resources, Elipe S.A. and Copper Santa Barbara and 
EcuadorGold. 
 
¶9. (U) In other mining news, Minister of Petroleum and Mines Galo 
Chiriboga announced that the GOE's new draft mining law will be 
 
ready for submission to the Constituent Assembly by June 27.  On 
June 6, Stephen J. Kay, President and CEO of International Minerals 
Corp., told the New York Society of Securities Analysts metals and 
mining conference that he thinks the market will be pleasantly 
surprised with the new mining law.  According to a study by the 
Central University of Ecuador, Ecuador has mining potential of 94 
million ounces of gold, which is equivalent to USD 84.4 billion at 
current prices. 
 
Remittances 
----------- 
 
¶10. (U) According to Central Bank data, remittances grew by 12.3% in 
the first quarter of 2008 in comparison with the same quarter in 
2007, totaling $759.3 million.  (This was, however, a drop from 
remittances in the fourth quarter of 2007, but it appears that 
remittances typically weaken in the first quarter.)   Much of 
Ecuador's remittances come from the Euro zone, and the Euro has 
strengthened against the dollar, which has helped to shore up 
dollar-based remittances. 
 
¶11.  (U) Since 2006, remittances coming from the U.S., Spain and 
Italy represent 95.4% of all remittances entering Ecuador.  On 
average the monthly amount of money sent per person is $516 from 
Spain, $457 from Italy, and $299 from the US.  Almost half of the 
remittances go to the coastal region; 31.7% goes to the southern 
part of Ecuador, and 22.8% goes to the highland region.
