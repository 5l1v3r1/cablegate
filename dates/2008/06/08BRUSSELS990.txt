SUBJECT: IMPLEMENTATION OF THE IRISL CARGO INSPECTION
PROVISION OF UNSCR 1803: BELGIAN RESPONSE

REF: STATE 69339

Classified By: CDA RICHARD EASON, REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D).

 ¶1.  (S) Charge delivered the points in reftel to Werner
Bauwens, the head of the MFA's Non-proliferation Office on
June 30.  He agreed to relay the points to all the relevant
offices and agencies within the GOB.

¶2.  (S)  Bauwens noted that the EU had adopted sanctions
based on UNSCR 1803 last Monday and had taken all the steps
required under UNSCR 1803.  Belgium's banks have also already
taken action and, indeed, many had already taken actions in
anticipation.  Bauwens commented that the U.S. had moved
beyond 1803 with its actions against Bank Melli.

¶3.  (S)  Cargo issues have also been raised within the EU;
the new element is the request to inspect suspect cargo.
Bauwens said this created difficulties.  He asked how such
inspections would be organized.  If a ship comes in full of
containers and the suspect one is on the bottom of the stack,
who pays for the costs of unloading and inspecting the cargo?
 How does one define a cargo is suspect and on what criteria?


¶4.  (S)  Bauwens stressed that information exchange on
shipments must be improved to create a system with timely
advance warning.  He was concerned that shipping companies
would begin to balk at requests to inspect containers when
many were found to contain innocent items.  He said that this
is the reason why the GOB is working within the EU to such up
just such an improved information exchange system,
