¶1. (SBU) Post delivered the points in the referenced cables 
via diplomatic note to the Ministry of International 
Relations, the Ministry of Food, the Ministry of Agriculture 
and Land, and the Ministry of Light Industry and Commerce 
(refs A, B, C).  There has been no response to date and Post 
does not expect BRV cooperation on either the elimination of 
export restrictions or the promotion of biotechnology for 
domestic political reasons. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Venezuela generally exports very little in the way 
of agricultural products.  Nevertheless, it maintains trade 
restrictions on certain categories of food, requiring 
exporters to obtain "certificates of local sufficiency" prior 
to shipment (ref D).  The BRV has also come out publicly 
against biotechnology (ref E).  Post will continue in its 
efforts to open a dialogue with the BRV on these issues.
