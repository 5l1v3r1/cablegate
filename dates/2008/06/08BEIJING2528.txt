¶2. VFM Wu Dawei held a press conference at the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs at 5:00 p.m. on June 26, 2008.  Wu, acting as "the head of 
the Chinese delegation to the Six-Party Talks," read a short

¶3. The text of Wu's statement is as follows: 
 
The Six-Party Talks has made positive progress in the second-phase 
actions for the implementation of the Joint Statement thanks to the 
concerted efforts of all Parties. 
 
In the spirit of the October 3, 2007 Six-Party agreement on June 26, 
2008, the DPRK will submit its nuclear declaration to the Chair of 
the Six-Party Talks and the United States will implement its 
obligations to remove the designation of the DPRK as a state sponsor 
of terrorism and to terminate application of the Trading with the 
Enemy Act. 
 
The Parties agreed that the declaration will be subject to 
verification and there is agreement within the Parties on a set of 
principles to guide the establishment of a verification regime. 
 
The Parties agreed to establish a Monitoring Mechanism to cover all 
parties' obligations in the Six-Party Talks including 
nonproliferation and economic and energy assistance. 
 
The Parties reaffirmed the September 19, 2005 Joint Statement goal 
to realize the verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. 
 
We believe that the above-mentioned developments will be conducive 
to implementing the second-phase actions in a comprehensive and 
balanced manner, and the final realization of the goals in the 
September 19, 2005 Joint Statement.
