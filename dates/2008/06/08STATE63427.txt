SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSE 05-971940 
 
REF: BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 2006 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-3. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post's assistance in conducting 
a post-shipment check on license 05-971940 for the export of 
night vision devices (NVDs) to Spain.  Post is requested to 
complete this Blue Lantern check within 45 days.  Lack of 
response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and 
future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request:  Due to the sensitivity of the 
equipment and the potential for their diversion or misuse, 
the Department of State and the Department of Defense have 
policies of carefully scrutinizing NVD export licenses and 
taking steps to ensure proper end-use.  Provisos attached to 
these licenses obligate the end-user to secure the NVDs from 
loss, theft, or unauthorized access, and to perform routine 
inventory checks by serial number.  These records are to be 
made available for review upon US Government request.  Post 
is requested to make appropriate inquiries to determine or 
confirm the following: 
 
--The exact quantity and serial numbers of any NVDs received 
by the Spanish Marines under this license 
 
--Continued possession by the Spanish Marines of the NVDs 
 
--Whether the actual end-use of the NVDs is the same as the 
end-use listed on this license 
 
--Whether the Spanish Marines are expecting any further 
shipments of NVDs under this license 
 
--All NVDs are secure and being used only for the purpose 
stated on the license 
 
¶4. Department requests that post conduct a site visit, if 
possible, in order to gather and verify this information.  If 
a site visit is not possible, please obtain official written 
confirmation of receipt and possession and inform PM/DTCC 
case officer. 
 
¶5. For background, the following details of the license in 
question are provided:

separate shipments on 05/27/2006, 08/30/2006, and 03/24/2007. 
 It is possible that the end-user reduced the quantity of 
NVDs ordered from 2,000 to 350.  END COMMENT.)
