REQUEST 
 
REF: STATE 57726 (ACTION REQUEST) 
 
¶1. (SBU) Having previously provided the Thai Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs International Organizations Department with 
the background information and non-paper on the May 26 
International Atomic Energy Association (IAEA) report on 
Iran's nuclear activities, we called on Third Secretary of 
the Peace, Security, and Disarmament (PSD) Division, Pakawat 
Srisukwattana, on June 2 and made the points in reftel. 
(Note: PSD is short-staffed with only four junior officers 
and an acting chief on frequent travel. Pakawat has 
responsibility for oversight of IAEA issues.) 
 
¶2. (SBU) With regards to the reference material provided and 
comments made, Pakawat advised that Thailand would take the 
U.S. perspective into consideration while preparing for the 
June 2-6 IAEA Board of Governors meeting. Pakawat noted that 
Thailand had concerns about the reaction of the Thai business 
community to the the results of the meetings. He advised, 
however, that the Thai representative in Vienna would 
ultimately determine the Thai position. 
 
¶4. (U) Embassy Bangkok's point of contact is Political 
Officer Lisa Kaleczyc.
