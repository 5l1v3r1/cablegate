SUBJECT: June 9 Darfuri Asylum Seekers: Ambassador's Meeting with 
Ghana Refugee Board Chair 
 
Ref:  Accra 477 
 
¶1. (SBU) On June 9, the Ambassador met with Ghana Refugee Board 
(GRB) Chair Emmanuel Bentil Owusu, GRB Secretary Mummuni Abdulai 
Bawumia, UNHCR Accra Representative Aida Haile Mariam, UNHCR 
Protection Officer Paulette Dadey, and UNHCR Durable Solutions 
Officer Senai Terrefe to discuss the situation of a group of twelve 
Darfuri asylum seekers, some of whose claims had been rejected by 
the GRB on February 28, 2008.  The Ambassador noted the USG concern 
regarding the humanitarian crisis in Darfur and interest in ensuring 
that Darfuri refugees receive appropriate protection in the 
countries of asylum. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The GRB discussed concerns about Sudanese asylum seekers 
in general, including the 480 Darfuri refugees in the Krisan Refugee 
Settlement.  The GRB expressed  their belief that Darfuri are coming 
to seek resettlement, that some Chadians are posing as Sudanese, and 
that traffickers have been involved in assisting Sudanese enter 
Ghana.  The GRB did not have any information that these twelve had 
fraudulent identities or false persecution claims, but believed 
their transit through other countries without requesting asylum 
indicated they did not need international protection.  The GRB noted 
that rejected asylum seekers are not required to leave Ghana; 
therefore rejection should not be a concern.  They also noted the 
refugees have filed appeals and anticipates the Minister of the 
Interior will make a determination on the appeals within the next 
couple weeks.  Regarding the asylum seekers' welfare, the GRB noted 
that they have listed mosques as their point of contact and 
residence.  The GRB indicated that the twelve are receiving medical 
and education assistance and skills training. UNHCR Representative 
Mariam added her plea that Ghana would continue its gracious policy 
of positively reviewing legitimate claims for asylum and not let 
misrepresentation by some asylum seekers unduly influence this 
process.
