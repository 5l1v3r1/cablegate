¶1. (SBU) Bank Indonesia (BI) raised its reference rate by 25 basis 
points on June 5, signifying a cautious approach to fighting 
inflation in order to maintain economic growth momentum.  Most 
analysts expected a larger rate hike, given mounting price 
pressures.  Global food and fuel prices are set to remain high this 
year, providing both challenges and opportunities for Indonesia, 
according to a World Bank Forum on high international commodity 
prices.  The ability of the Government of Indonesia (GOI) to 
capitalize on opportunities remains uncertain, according to the 
experts.  End Summary. 
 
Central Bank Cautious 
--------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) On May 5, BI raised the reference interest rate 25 basis 
points for the second time this year in response to increased 
inflation in May.  The central bank also moved its reference rate 
from the 30-day SBI rate to the overnight inter-bank rate as of June 
9 to reduce volatility in the overnight market.  Most market 
analysts had expected a larger rate hike, given mounting price 
pressure (reftel).  In the accompanying press statement, BI 
officials attributed much of the rise in May inflation to external 
sources.  BI Governor Boediono also noted to the press that the 
central bank will use all monetary tools available to control 
inflation, including managing exchange-rate volatility. 
 
¶3. (SBU) According to a member of the parliament's (DPR) banking and 
finance committee (Commission 11), BI plans to raise rates to 9.5% 
by the end of the year in 25 basis point increments.  The plan for 
slow and steady rate increases contrasts sharply with the central 
bank's response to inflation in 2005, when BI increased rates by a 
total of 425 basis points over a five month period.  While the 
recent incrase in subsidized fuel prices is considerably lowe than 
the increase in 2005, non-fuel inflationar pressures are greater 
this year than in 2005.  I addition, there are signs that 
inflationary expctations are growing.  Local research firm 
Danarksa's index of inflation expectations rose to its ighest 
level yet recorded in May, surpassing thelevel in November 2005. 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) The GOI and th central bank will face a critical test in 
the cming months as they attempt to tackle inflation an maintain 
economic growth.  A failure to controlinflation is likely to result 
in a loss of confience from market participants, particularly 
interational investors.  The GOI recently announced plas to raise 
$1.5 billion in international marketsto finance the buddget deficit. 
 The ability of tee GOI to secure international financing at a 
reao*nable price will be an important gauge of market sentiment 
toward Indonesia.  In addition, signs ofsslower consumption, the 
dominant driver of growt  in Indonesia over the past 12 months, have 
emereed.  Bank Indonesia's consumer confidence index fel( to a two 
and a half year low in May, while Danareksa's May consumer 
confidence index fell to its lowest level since November 2005. 
 
Panel Cites Commodity Price Challenges, Opportunities 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶5. (U) High global fuel and food prices are unlikely to abate in the 
short run according to experts at a World Bank-sponsored conference 
on the impact of high commodity prices in Indonesia.  The panelist 
reported that higher food and fuel prices continue to 
disproportionately impact the poorest of the poor in Indonesia.  The 
experts urged Indonesia to undertake targeted, conditional cash 
transfer programs to assist the poor and promote sustainable 
economic development, rather than the current unconditional cash 
transfer program or in-kind transfers.  The group criticized the 
GOI's subsidized rice program (RASKIN), arguing that RASKIN is 
difficult to implement and produces leakages.  They pointed out that 
most poor households can only afford to purchase 6 kg of rice per 
month, rendering the increase in the amount available to poor

households to 15 kg meaningless. 
 
¶6.  (U) The forum speakers also noted that Indonesia stands to gain 
significantly from higher commodity prices, particularly in the 
agriculture sector.  However, those gains depend on the GOI's 
ability to enable productivity gains in the sector.  Restrictive 
land-use policies, limited access to new agriculture technology, and 
poor infrastructure inhibit productivity gains in agriculture.  The 
lack of infrastructure in rural communities also exacerbates poverty 
rates by increasing prices in hard to reach locations.  According to 
the experts, the rice price disparity between regions in Indonesia 
can be as high as 64 percent.
