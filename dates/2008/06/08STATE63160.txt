CONSULTATIONS 
 
 
¶1.  USUN may draw from the following points during the 12 
June UN Security Council Consultations on the Sudan Sanctions 
Committee. 
 
- The United States welcomes the statement by the Chair of 
the 1591 Committee concerning the Sudan.  We would also like 
to take this opportunity to thank the Panel of Experts for 
their work and professional commitment to impartial 
reporting.  We support the Panel's mandated activities and 
note with great concern its May 14 midterm report which notes 
no signs of improvement in the implementation of Resolution 
¶1591.  It is especially troubling that the report indicates 
that training, arms, ammunition, vehicles, and other 
logistical equipment continue to flow to non-State armed 
groups in Darfur.  With that in mind, I would like to make 
four points. 
 
- First, the situation in Sudan is very troubling, and we are 
concerned that hostilities have escalated with all parties 
showing a willful disregard for the Council's measures in 
Darfur, as evidenced by the Government of Sudan,s May 4 
bombing of villages in Darfur and the subsequent May 10 
attack by Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) rebels on 
Omdurman. 
 
- Second, the United States calls upon the Government of 
Sudan to comply with its international obligations.  It must 
stop offensive military overflights in and over the Darfur 
region.  The deplorable practice of using aircraft painted 
white, which resemble humanitarian aircraft, must cease 
immediately.  The Government of Sudan must also comply with 
its obligations to facilitate the deployment of UNAMID.  The 
pattern of overflights and obstruction to the deployment of 
self-sustaining troops for UNAMID demonstrates the Government 
of Sudan's disregard for this Council's decisions. 
 
- Third, we expect the Government of Sudan to implement fully 
resolution 1672 (2006), which requires all Member States to 
freeze the assets and prevent entry into or transit through 
their territories of the four individuals designated in that 
resolution.  These individuals have been designated for 
impeding the peace process; constituting a threat to 
stability in Darfur and the region; committing violations of 
international humanitarian or human rights law; or violating 
the arms embargo. 
 
- Fourth, we would request the Committee follow up to: 
 
-- ensure that UNAMID staff is trained and aware of the arms 
embargo; 
 
-- urge the Government of Sudan to issue multiple entry visas 
to the Panel of Experts so it can have ready access to do its 
work; and 
 
-- request that the Panel of Experts meet with the Western 
Military commander in West Darfur and continue to seek out 
additional information on the inflow of arms to non-State 
armed groups in Darfur.
