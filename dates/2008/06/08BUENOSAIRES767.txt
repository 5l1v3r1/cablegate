REF: SECSTATE 57726 
 
(SBU) Emboffs delivered reftel non-paper to the Argentine 
MFA's Directorate for International Security, Nuclear and 
Space Issues (DIGAN) on May 30.  In a following conversation 
June 3 with Sebastian Sayus of DIGAN, he responded that the 
MFA largely shares the USG's views on Iran's non-compliance 
and the IAEA investigation's findings, and that the GoA's 
delegation to the ongoing June 2-6 IAEA Board meeting will 
"act accordingly."
