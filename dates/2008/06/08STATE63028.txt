SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSE 050107086 
 
 
¶1. (U) This is an Action Request. See paragraphs 2 - 4. 
 
¶2. (U) The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a pre-license check on license 050107086 for the export of 
firearms to Guatemala. Post is requested to complete this 
Blue Lantern check within 30 days. Lack of response to a Blue 
Lantern check will affect pending and future licenses 
involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Reason for Request: To establish the bona fides of 
this transaction and the parties involved. It is unclear 
under what authority the firearms will be imported into 
Guatemala, and Israeli company International Security and 
Defense Systems is suspected of unauthorized brokering. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Action Request: Posts are requested to establish the 
 
bona fides of these transactions by making appropriate 
inquires to authorities of the International Commission 
Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) and International 
Security & Defense Systems. Embassy Tel Aviv is requested to 
make appropriate inquiries to determine whether International 
Security & Defense Systems is brokering United States 
Munitions List (USML) items without being registered with the 
Department. Embassy Guatemala is requested to make 
appropriate inquiries to establish the bona fides of the 
transaction. Embassy Guatemala is also requested to provide 
clarification on the authority under which these firearms are 
to be imported into Guatemala. The following questions have 
been included for guidance: 
 
For International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala: 
 
--Did the International Commission Against Impunity in 
Guatemala order the items listed below? 
 
--How did International Security & Defense Systems become 
party to this transaction? 
 
--Proof of import authorization from the country of ultimate 
destination is among the required supporting documents for 
applications for exports of firearms from the U.S.  This 
application did not include any such import certificate. 
Under what authority will the firearms be imported into 
Guatemala? 
 
For the Guatemalan Departmento de Control de Armas y 
Municiones (DECAM): 
 
--Is DECAM aware of this proposed transaction? Is CICIG 
authorized to import these firearms into Guatemala? 
 
For International Security & Defense Systems: 
 
--Please describe International Security & Defense Systems' 
role in the proposed transaction. How did International 
Security and Defense Systems become party to this 
transaction? What are the terms by which International 
Security and Defense Systems is doing business with CICIG? 
 
--Does the company have proper supporting documentation, 
including a contract from CICIG, for this proposed 
transaction? 
 
--If serving as a broker in this proposed transaction, is 
International Security & Defense Systems aware that U.S. law 
requires brokers of USML items to register with the State 
Department and to obtain prior authorization for many 
brokered transactions? 
 
--Will the firearms be shipped directly from the U.S. to 
Guatemala, or will they be shipped via Israel? 
 
--If the company will be handling or storing the items listed 
on the application, does it have secure facilities and proper 
accounting and security procedures for handling these 
sensitive USML items? 
 
--When was the company established and who are its principals? 
 
--What types of organizations are among its typical customers 
and where are the customers located? 
 
In its reply, posts may also comment on any other information 
pertinent to these transactions such as security of 
facilities, end-use, and concerns about the entities involved.
