The Embassy of the United States of America presents its 
compliments to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian 
Federation and has the honor to refer to Diplomatic Note No. 
50 dated January 14, 2008.  As requested, the Embassy passed 
the information contained in the subject Diplomatic Note to 
the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for 
investigation.  The FAA expresses its appreciation to the MFA 
for calling attention to this matter and providing a detailed 
investigation report.  The FAA subsequently conducted its own 
investigation into the incident involving the U.S.-registered 
Falcon-900 aircraft with the registration number N139AL on 
November 9, 2007, at Emelyanovo, Krasnoyarsk, and whether the 
aircraft landed at Emelyanovo when weather conditions were 
less than the required airport meteorological minimums.  As a 
result of FAA's investigation, FAA has taken enforcement 
action against the pilot in the form of administrative 
action.  A warning notice was issued to the pilot in 
accordance with FAA's compliance and enforcement policy, 
which will be made part of the pilot's enforcement history. 
 
Complimentary closing.
