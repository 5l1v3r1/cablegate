Al-Quds opens with reports on the Egyptian brokered Israel/Gaza 
truce talks under the headline, "Hamas will inform Cairo of its 
final decision [Jne 17]."  The paper quotes Hamas leader Ismael 
Hniyyah stating, "The draft of the truce agreement s in its final 
stage."  Al-Quds also quotes Israli Defense Minister Barak 
explaining, "should we each a truce agreement with Gaza, we will 
have t make painful decisions regarding Palestinian prisner 
issues."  The same story concludes with a qute by Palestinian 
presidential spokesperson Abu udaynah highlighting that President 
Abbas insiststhat the "siege" on the Gaza Strip should be lifte 
"immediately" after the signing of a truce agrement.  Al-Hayat 
Al-Jadida leads with, "PresidentAbbas is hoping to reach a truce 
[with Israelis]in the coming days and he has stressed the need to 
open [Gaza] border crossings."  On the ground, th three dailies 
report that four Palestinian "figters" were killed and sevral 
others injured in an Israeli military strikeon the southern Gaza 
Strip in Khan Younis. 
 
Th dailies report on trilateral discussions held by ecretary Rice 
with Israeli Defense Minister Bara and Palestinian Prime Minister 
Fayyad on June 16in Jerusalem. Al-Quds reports that, "Fayyad 
reitrated Palestinian opposition to continued settlemet activities 
in Jerusalem."   Related reports inthe dailies highlight Israeli 
Premier Olmert's sggestion to postpone discussion on the status of 
erusalem.  The stories note that he informed Rice bout his 
intention to continue Jerusalem settlemnt activities.  Palestinian 
presidency spokesperon Nabil Abu Rudaynah responded to Olmert's 
statment, commenting that there can be, "no solution [t the 
conflict] unless occupied Arab Jerusalem beomes the capital of the 
independent Palestinian tate."  Al-Ayyam reports Secretary Rice 
stating hat she, "did not sense any change in the Israeli osition 
toward settlements."  Al-Hayat Al-Jadida ummarizes that Rice, 
"ended her visit without beng able to remove checkpoints."  The 
same story adds that, "Israel is resisting American pressure to 
reach a [peace] agreement." 
The meeting between Palestinian President Abbas and Arab League 
Secretary General Amr Musa in Amman on June 16 is front page news. 
According to coverage, the two leaders discussed a possible 
Palestinian-Israeli truce, negotiations with Israel and internal 
Palestinian dialogue. The dailies report that Abbas also gave a 
read-out of his meetings with Secretary Rice. 
The papers headline internal Palestinian, "reconciliation talks."

at the end of the month.  Reports also note that Fatah delegations 
will meet with Fatah members in Gaza in preparation of talks with 
other Palestinian parties. 
Al-Quds reports that the State Department confirmed that President 
Bush confirmed the necessity of establishing a Palestinian state in 
the West Bank and Gaza.  The paper writes that President Bush's 
comments were sent to Al Quds in response to its on-line report 
about presidential hopeful John McCain's comments about an 
"alternative home" for Palestinians. 
The three dailies run coverage of the visit by members of an ECA 
citizen exchange program administered by the, American Council of 
Young Political Leaders (ACYPL) to Palestinian areas.  Al-Quds 
quotes the Governor of Bethlehem telling the delegation, that 
includes U.S. state legislators, that the Palestinian people, "yearn 
for peace" with Israel and that Palestinians, "have sacrificed a 
great deal for the cause of peace."  The articles quote an ACYPL 
delegation member explaining that the visit is part of ongoing

efforts to increase exchanges between Palestinian and American youth 
leaders.  Separate reports also cover the delegation's meeting with 
the Governor of Salfit in the West Bank.  The Governor is quoted 
speaking about the, "suffering of Palestinians" in his governorate 
as a result of the separation barrier and ongoing settlement 
activities.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------ 
¶1.  Independent Al-Quds runs its daily editorial under the title, 
"What surprise are we waiting for?" (17/7): "The current Palestinian 
situation faces two immediate and important challenges; the first 
challenge is related to the brave initiative that was launched by 
President Abu Mazin to resume national talks after a long year of 
division, weakness and suffering.  The second challenge is related 
to efforts sponsored by Egypt to reach a truce between Hamas and 
Israel.  These efforts have reached a critical stage with both sides 
having stated their conditions and having found a compromise 
position.  A truce is expected to be reached shortly ... the issue 
of national talks is the main challenge that faces the two parties 
of the nation.  Talks should not be for the purpose of 
sloganeering... but should unify political positions and lead to 
real action..." 
 
¶2.  Independent official daily Al-Hayat Al-Jadida carries an op-ed 
by columnist Omar Al-Ghoul entitled, "What is the meaning of Rice's 
comments?" (6/17):  "At the end of her visit to the region, Dr. Rice 
made a very vague, negative statement about Israeli settlement 
policy, which is destroying any horizon for political agreement, 
contrary to international laws and norms, and against all agreements 
that were signed by the two sides from Oslo to Annapolis in 2007. 
Secretary Rice said that settlements 'might' affect the peace 
process. Such a comment does not reflect an American desire to 
pressure the occupation and aggression state of Israel.  On the 
contrary, it gives Israel motivation and justification to continue 
its policies to judanize and confiscate Palestinian lands.  The 
direct proof for this is found in the Israeli Prime Minister's 
assurance that settlement activities will continue and not affect 
negotiations.  It is as if he is saying [to Rice], 'we don't think 
that your comment has any relevance to us ..."
