In Today's Papers 
 
EU Process Depends on Lawsuit 
All papers:   Today's lead news story in papers focuses on the 
outcome of yesterday's discussions the Parliamentary Assembly of the 
Council of Europe (PACE).  PACE approved a report prepared by 
Belgian MP Luc Van den Brande on "The functioning of democratic 
institutions in Turkey."  The report said it may be necessary to 
activate a monitoring mechanism for Turkey because the closure of 
the ruling AKP would result in decreased political stability in 
Turkey and would negatively affect Turkey's EU bid. 
Conservative-nationalist Turkiye writes, "The Council of Europe 
Sends a Harsh Message to Turkey," as, "Banning a ruling party would 
lead to a social crisis and would make EU accession impossible." 
Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak's front-page banner headline reads, 
"The Council of Europe Issues a Stern Warning against the Judicial 
Coup."  Islamist-oriented Zaman writes, "PACE calls the ban of the 
AKP, 'a blow to democracy,'" as the goal of the debates, "was not to 
punish Turkey, but to rescue democracy," as AKP closure would, 
"render Turkey to the league of fragile democracies."  Mainstream 
Sabah carries the headline, "The EU Process Depends on the Outcome 
of the Closure Case."  Mainstream Hurriyet notes, "PACE Adopts a 
Harsh Stance on the Suit against the AKP," and reports, "PACE 
adopted a report that was ordered by AKP officials."  In addition, 
Hurriyet carries excerpts of the joint declaration from opposition 
CHP and MHP, calling PACE's declaration, "an intervention in the 
Turkish judicial process."  Liberal Radikal notes, "The Closure of 
the AKP Would Cause Europe to Consider Our Democracy a Second Class 
Democracy," as, "PACE sent the message that banning the AKP would be 
a judicial coup, which could be followed by a military coup." 
Mainstream Milliyet reports, "PACE Strongly Supports the AKP." 
Mainstream Vatan writes, "PACE Warns Turkey that AKP Closure Could 
Lead to Turkey's Placement on the Blacklist of Troubled 
Democracies," and, "yesterday's PACE meeting threw strong support 
behind the AKP."  Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet comments, "PACE Is 
Monitoring Turkey," and thus, "PACE poses a threat to Turkey." 
 
EDITORIAL OPINION: Turkish Political Debates 
 
"The Military's Statement" 
Ercan Karakas wrote in leftist Birgun (6/27): "Turkey is going 
through a serious political crisis.  The political system, more 
importantly the ruling party, prefers to work for its own agenda 
rather than defending democracy for everyone.  In addition, the 
ruling party does not seek consensus and dialogue in order to 
decrease political tensions.  A solution to Turkey's political 
problem must be found within its democratic structure, regardless of 
the nature of the political tensions.  Therefore, it is wrong for 
the military to devise a plan to manipulate public opinion for the 
purposes of pushing its own political agenda.  When the Turkish 
General Staff's documents regarding this plan were revealed, TGS 
declared, 'there is no such officially approved plan or document.' 
This statement is positive, but not satisfactory because some 
important questions remain unanswered.  For example, who prepared 
this plan and who is behind this effort?  The main opposition CHP 
asked TGS to initiate an investigation, but as far as I can see, no 
such investigation has begun. This is an important matter and should 
not be ignored.  Why didn't the government respond to reports of the 
military's plans?  What is government's position regarding an 
investigation into this issue?  We are still waiting." 
 
"Will the Constitutional Court Go on Vacation this summer?" 
Murat Yetkin wrote in liberal-intellectual Radikal (6/27): "From a 
procedural perspective, the closure case against the AKP should be 
resolved soon.  However, there is not a binding calendar or a legal 
deadline for the Court's final decision.  One thing is clear. The 
longer it takes for the Court to conclude this case, the more 
political uncertainties in Turkey will continue to grow. 
Traditionally, the judiciary's summer holiday begins in early 
August, but the Constitutional Court is not bound to that tradition. 
 
ANKARA 00001179  002 OF 003 
 
 
 Speculation in Ankara indicates the Court will not recess until the 
AKP closure case is finalized.  Once this decision is reached, 
everyone will benefit because we can all move on. There are three 
possibilities regarding the Court's decision. First, the court may 
close the party and impose a political ban on certain figures, 
including PM Erdogan.  Second, the court could reject the indictment 
and dismiss the case.  Finally, the court could find the AKP guilty 
of anti-secular activities, but impose a practical penalty by 
cutting off state treasury financing to the party.  The majority of 
political circles in Ankara consider the first option as the most 
probable outcome.  Very few consider the other two options as strong 
possibilities.  Nevertheless, the court will not reach its decision 
based on the majority's expectations anyway." 
 
 
National Security Council (NSC) Convened Yesterday 
All papers report that the NSC convened for five and half hours 
under the chairmanship of President Gul yesterday.  In a statement 
released after the meeting, the NSC Secretariat General said that 
council members discussed, "operations and measures by security 
forces against the terrorist organization, recent developments in 
Iraq, and measures which officials would take regarding Turkey's 
rising energy demand.  The Council expressed determination that 
successful operations against the terrorist organization and 
measures regarding the fight against terrorism would be pursued. 
The Council members assessed the results of meetings held with Iraqi 
officials.  The statement confirmed Turkey would contribute to 
efforts to stabilize Iraq and the broader region.  Council members 
also discussed policies regarding Turkey's energy security.  They 
decided to capitalize on domestic and renewable energy sources and 
increase cooperation with neighboring countries.  Finally, the 
statement underscored Turkey's important role as a transit country 
for energy resources. 
 
Intensified Operations against the PKK 
Sabah and Milliyet report that Turkish security forces have stepped 
up operations against the PKK in the Gabar and Kupeli Mountains.  In 
addition, military operations have intensified in the 
Bestler-Dereler region of Sirnak. Large numbers of commando troops 
were dispatched to the region, along with Cobra helicopters. 
Meanwhile, a group of PKK opened fire on a minibus carrying soldiers 
near the town of Lice in the Diyarbakir region.   The driver died 
and four soldiers were wounded. 
 
The Largest Number of U.S. Nuclear Bombs in any European Country are 
in Turkey 
Milliyet cites Reuters in a report from the American Federation of 
Scientists, who claim the U.S. stores nuclear bombs in six European 
countries, including Holland, Belgium, Germany, Italy and Turkey. 
Reuters cites nuclear weapons expert Hans Kristensen's report, which 
states the U.S. keeps most of its nuclear bombs in Turkey's Incirlik 
air base and Italy's Aviano air base.
