Professor Aziza Bennani, Ambassador and Permanent Delegate to

Organization (UNESCO), for the position of Director General 
of UNESCO. The full candidate packet will be scanned and

Complimentary opening. 
 
The Kingdom of Morocco has decided to submit the candidacy of 
Professor Aziza Bennani, Ambassador and Permanent Delegate of 
the Kingdom of Morocco to UNESCO, to the position of Director 
General of this organization during the elections to be held 
in Paris in October 2009. 
 
Enclosed is the curriculum vitae of Professor Aziza Bennani, 
a supporting argument to her candidacy, as well as a 
biography, that underlines her academic profile, career, 
international experience, and deep knowledge of UNESCO, which 
make her an excellent candidate for the General Directorate 
of this prestigious organization. 
 
It should be noted that none of the previous Directors 
General of UNESCO have belonged to the Arab Group. As a 
result, and according to the principle of rotation, certainly 
not included in the texts, but now in force within the 
Organization, candidatures from this group will be supported. 
So far, other than Morocco (July 2007), only Egypt has 
announced its candidacy (August 2007). 
 
Under the leadership of His Majesty King Mohammed VI, Morocco 
is fully committed to a democratic process. Moreover, it 
continues resolutely its political, economic and social 
reforms, whose ultimate goal is to make Morocco a modern, 
developed and democratic country. The priorities of this 
major reform project are human development, the fight against 
poverty, the generalization of eduction, the promotion of 
women and children's rights, and consolidation of a national 
cultural identity. 
 
The Kingdom of Morocco, which fully adheres to 
multilateralism and which celebrated last November the 50th 
anniversary of its accession to UNESCO, fully supports the 
principles and objectives inscribed in its founding Charter, 
and its mission in favor of peace. Having made a real 
vocation out of the search for peace, it continues to 
militate for the values advocated by the United Nations and 
which are also its own values. It is now convinced of 
UNESCO's responsibility in the consolidation of democracy, 
the promotion of development and the establishment of peace 
in the world. 
 
Given all these considerations and our common interests 
regarding UNESCO, the Government of Morocco, which fully 
supports this candidacy, would particularly appreciate the 
support that your Government could bring to it. 
 
Complimentary closing.
