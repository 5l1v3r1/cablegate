H.E. Thomas J. Barrett 
Deputy Secretary of Transportation 
The United States of America 
 
Your Excellency, 
 
It was my great pleasure to meet you during the fourth 
U.S.-China Strategic Economic Dialogue held in the 
United States, exchanging views on expanding U.S.- 
China transportation cooperation and signing the Joint 
Declaration on Transportation Cooperation between two 
sides.  Here I would like to thank your Excellency and 
your colleagues for your considerate arrangement and 
warm hospitality during our stay in the United States. 
 
China and U.S. are important trade partners, and 
transportation, maritime transport in particular, 
plays a vital role in making possible the great 
volumes of trade flows.  The Joint Declaration, 
identifying the priorities and direction for our 
future cooperation, will further promote the pragmatic 
transportation cooperation between our two countries. 
 
Your Excellency, I would like to reiterate that the 
Chinese side attaches great importance to 
transportation cooperation with the U.S. and, we are 
willing to work closely with you to launch cooperation 
in areas identified in the Joint Declaration under the 
framework of U.S.-China Strategic Economic Dialogue, 
aiming at pushing forward the efficient, safe and 
sustainable development of transportation. 
 
Once again thank your Excellency for your hospitality 
extended to us and I am looking forward to meeting you 
in the near future. 
 
Please accept, your Excellency, the assurances of my 
highest consideration. 
 
(Weng Mengyong) 
Vice Minister of Transport 
The People's Republic of China
