¶1. Department authorizes USUN to convey to the Chair of the 
Security Council Sanctions Committee established pursuant to 
resolution 918 (1994) concerning Rwanda and the Permanent 
Representative of the Mission of Rwanda that the U.S. 
supports terminating the remaining sanctions monitored by 
that Committee.  The measures contained in operative 
paragraph 9 of resolution 1011 (1995) were imposed with a 
view to prohibiting the sale and supply of arms and related 
material to non-governmental forces for use in Rwanda.  The 
United States understands that the Government of Rwanda is 
sufficiently in control of its territory and supports the 
lifting by the Security Council of the remaining Chapter VII 
measures related to Rwanda set out in paragraph 9 of 
resolution 1011 (1995). 
 
¶2. Department appreciates Mission's efforts.
