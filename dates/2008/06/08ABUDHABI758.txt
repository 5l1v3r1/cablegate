SUBJECT: AMF SIGNS IRAQ DEBT RESCHEDULING 
 
¶1. (SBU) On June 24, Dr. Jassim Al-Mannai, Director General and 
Chairman of the Board of the Arab Monetary Fund told Econchief that 
he had recently signed a debt rescheduling agreement with Iraq's 
Minister of Finance in Jordan.  Iraq is currently the largest debtor 
to the AMF. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) In response to Econchief's question about whether this 
would allow Iraq to once again tap AMF funds, Al-Mannai explained 
that Iraq would need to demonstrate a repayment track record.  By way 
of illustration, he suggested that a positive one year repayment 
history could be sufficient.
