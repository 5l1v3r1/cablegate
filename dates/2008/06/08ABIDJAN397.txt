PAYMENT DISPUTE 
 
 
¶1. (U) The demobilization and disarmament of the Forces 
Nouvellles (FAFN) continue to be problematic for the 
government.  One June 16, more than 1000 troops paralyzed 
Bouake, demanding payment of promised monies. According to 
pres reports, the action was organized by soldiers who were 
to be integrated in the new joint army, which is to be formed 
as part of the peace process.  The disgruntled soldiers were 
claiming payments of 90,000 francs cfa (about $213) each, 
which they were promised they would receive monthly for a 
three-month period as part of the peace agreement.  Calm 
returned to the city with the intervention of their regional 
Commander, Sherif Ousmane, who pointed out that the source of 
the problem was not the Forces Nouvelles leadership but 
rather the difficult financial situation of the government of 
Cote d'Ivoire.  This likely brought little satisfaction to 
the regrouped soldiers whose only other source of income is 
money collected from racketeering at road stops for their 
survival. 
 
¶2. (U) However, the calm was short-lived.  This morning (June 
18,) soldiers believed to be FAFN have again taken their 
protests to the streets, shutting down Bouake for a second 
day.  Gunfire was heard throughout the city.  Streets were 
void of pedestrian and vehicle traffic, and businesses were 
shut.  Thus far, there are no reports of injuries.  Sources 
on the ground in Bouake believe the gunfire was not directed 
toward specific targets but rather random firing into the air. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The government's apparent inability to fund costs 
related to the regroupment of Forces Nouvelles soldiers, and 
the impact on the security environment could pose a serious 
threat to the viability of the November 30 date for 
presidential elections. PM Soro has repeatedly called on the 
international community to provide more financial assistance 
to help resolve this issue. The Ivorian press reported June 
18 that President Gbagbo, along with Burkina Faso President 
Blaise Compaore, met with Libyan leader Mouammar Kadhafi at 
the community of Sahelian-Saharan States (CEN-SAD) meeting 
that is taking place in Benin.  Kadhafi reportedly promised 
to partially finance the disarmament if there is a "blocage" 
or freezing of funding.  There is concern that if the FAFN 
are not paid soon, the protests could spread to other areas 
in the North and further complicate the peace process.  Post 
will continue to monitor and report on developments.
