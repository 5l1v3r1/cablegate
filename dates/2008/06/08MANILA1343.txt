SUBJECT: IAEA/IRAN: PHILIPPINES WILL VOICE CONCERNS ABOUT 
IAEA REPORT 
 
REF: SECSTATE 57726 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) The Philippine government has committed to make a 
clear statement regarding the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) report on Iran at the IAEA Board of Governors 
Meeting June 2-6.  Per reftel request, we met June 2 with 
Department of Foreign Affairs Director for Political, Legal, 
and Security Matters Leah Ruiz, who said the Philippines 
shared our concerns and would issue its own statement.  She 
noted that given the less stringent statement recently 
approved by fellow Non-Aligned Movement members, the 
Philippines would have to tread somewhat cautiously.  She 
said she expected the Philippine statement would raise their 
concerns regarding reported Iranian weapons development, 
while reiterating Philippine support for the "integrity, 
professionalism, and impartiality" of the IAEA.  Ruiz agreed 
that the IAEA report was disturbing and Iran's posture 
defiant.
