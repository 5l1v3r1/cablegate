SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
¶1. (C) In a June 25 dinner Ministry of Defense (MOD) Director 
General for Defense Policy Nobushige Takamizawa cited 
technical and political challenges to the possibility of 
Japan deploying helicopters or PRTs to Afghanistan.  He also 
underscored the Japanese Government's need to convince 
Japan's public and politicians of the importance of any 
mission.  On realignment, he suggested that MOD faces the 
predicament of explaining to the public the discrepancy 
between the U.S. and Japanese governments with respect to the 
number of military dependents to be moved from Okinawa to 
Guam.  Regarding  collective self defense, Takamizawa 
predicted Prime Minister Fukuda and the Cabinet will set 
aside the Yanai-led blue ribbon panel's report.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (C) In a June 25 farewell dinner hosted for the DCM, 
Ministry of Defense (MOD) Director General for Defense Policy 
Nobushige Takamizawa discussed a number of Alliance issues, 
including Japanese support of coalition operations in 
Afghanistan, realignment, and collective self defense. 
Takamizawa was accompanied by MOD Senior Coordinator for 
Realignment Marui, Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation Division 
Director Serizawa, Defense Policy Division Director Yamamoto, 
and Strategic Planning Division Director Nakajima.  Embassy 
Political Minister-Counselor, Defense Attache and other 
Embassy officers accompanied the DCM. 
 
Afghanistan 
----------- 
 
¶3. (C) DG Takamizawa noted that MOD is considering deploying 
Japanese CH-47 helicopters, and/or dispatching Japanese Self 
Defense Force (JSDF) members or civilian officials to 
provincial reconstruction teams (PRTs) in support of 
coalition operations in Afghanistan.  He singled out two main 
challenges with respect to expanding Japanese support for 
Afghan operations:  technical limits of Japanese CH-47s and 
the Japanese government's unenviable task of persuading Diet 
members to pass necessary legislation.  The JSDF's CH-47J 
helicopters do not have the same engine performance standards 
as U.S. CH-47s and will have difficulty operating in southern 
Afghanistan without significant modifications, he asserted. 
Takamizawa estimated it could take two to three years to make 
these modifications.  The dilemma, Takamizawa said, is that 
Japanese CH-47s should operate adequately in northern 
Afghanistan but the needs of the coalition forces are 
greatest in the south. 
 
¶4. (C) Perhaps more difficult than overcoming technical 
challenges is obtaining consensus among politicians and the 
Japanese public, Takamizawa said.  The Government of Japan 
needs to develop a specific, reasonable plan that it can 
present to members of the public to persuade them of the 
merits of deploying to Afghanistan.  While the possibility of 
casualties is something the Japanese public can come to 
accept with the right approach, politicians will remain 
averse to any risk to Japanese lives.  Takamizawa suggested 
that a deployment in the north and west of Afghanistan would 
minimize any casualties among Japanese Self Defense Force 
(JSDF) members or civilians and have the added benefit of 
being able to deploy JSDF CH-47s without modifications.  He 
added that participation in PRTs is an attractive option for 
the Japanese government to pursue, as it is an activity that 
can be illustrated more easily as humanitarian assistance 
efforts than the dispatch of CH-47s. 
 
¶5. (C) Takamizawa underscored that, regardless of where the 
helicopters might be deployed, three conditions must be met 
to convince the public and politicians of the need for a 
deployment to Afghanistan.  First, the Japanese government 
must characterize the operation as a humanitarian relief 
mission.  Second, the international community -- especially 
Afghanistan, the UK, Germany, and Canada -- must welcome and 
support publicly the Japanese plan.  Finally, the United 
States should highlight the importance of Japan's mission 
regardless of the substance of the activities. 
 
¶6. (C) When asked about possible roles for NGOs and other 
ministries and agencies in a deployment, Takamizawa noted 
that MOD has not yet engaged with other ministries or the 
Japanese public.  There is no clear lead in any of the 
Japanese ministries on the matter of deployment, he said.  He 
noted, however, that Japan is impressed with the role of 
civilian participation and leadership in Afghanistan and 
pledged to explore similar roles for Japan. 
 
Realignment 
----------- 
 
¶7. (C) Takamizawa lamented that he had not realized a serious 
gap existed between U.S. and Japanese figures on the number 
of military dependents involved in the relocation of U.S. 
Marines from Okinawa to Guam.  MOD faces a gargantuan task of 
explaining to the public the discrepancy, having had, in 
effect, ""sold false figures"" to the Japanese public. 
Japanese officials are currently deliberating internally on 
the best way to address the issue without opening the door 
for opposition leaders to call for a fundamental 
investigation into the realignment process.  DCM pointed out 
that we had been careful to state throughout the realignment 
process that the number of dependants cannot be fixed early 
on and that they would remain notional until final decisions 
are made on which uniformed personnel will relocate. 
 
Collective Self-Defense 
----------------------- 
 
¶8. (C) Regarding the June 24 report from the blue-ribbon 
panel on collective self defense headed by former Ambassador 
to the United States Shunji Yanai, Takamizawa said Prime 
Minister Fukuda and the cabinet will likely set aside any 
recommendations from the report for future deliberation.  His 
impression is that the report, while uncontroversial in 
content, is a rough sketch that reads like a ""wishlist"" that 
fails to address specific roadmaps for realizing collective 
self defense.  Takamizawa underscored that the Prime Minister 
and other senior officials are dismayed by the poor timing of 
the release of the report, as it can be viewed by the public 
as a gap in perception between the administration and the 
panel, i.e., between Fukuda and former PM Abe.  Barring a 
major incident, the report is not likely to generate much 
public interest, Takamizawa predicted.
