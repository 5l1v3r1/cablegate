Chavez's U-turn 
 
Article in center-right O Estado de S.Paulo (6/11) says: "Venezuelan 
President Hugo Chavez has traded darkness for light....He announced 
that 'Latin America has no place for guerillas any more....' The 
question that has echoed through the hemisphere-'what got into 
Chavez?'-has more than one answer to it. All of them...suggest he is 
finally convinced that the cost of protecting an organization that 
is repudiated by the vast majority of Colombians and has been 
harshly attacked by Bogot's administration greatly surpasses the 
benefits expected from a Bolivarian solidarity that could support 
Chavez's ambitions.... The dismantling of the Farc coincides with 
the reaction of Venezuelan democratic forces to Chavez's 
totalitarian plans.... Since [December's referendum] Chavez' 
popularity has fallen 20 points...and the prospects for the November 
elections are less favorable than he would like.... It is in this 
context that [Chavez's] u-turn fits.
