¶1. SUMMARY: On May 30, an OFDA team traveled to Leon and Chinandega to assess damage from Tropical Storm Alma. In collaboration with Nicaragua's Civil Defense and the GON's Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Agency (SINAPRED), OFDA identified roof reconstruction as the most urgent need. On June 1, 2008, USAID/Nicaragua signed a grant with Save the Children to repair the roofs of 128 homes, benefiting over 1,200 people. END SUMMARY.
 
¶A. Background:  According to preliminary reports by Nicaragua's 
Civil Defense, 1,284 houses were affected by Alma, of which 17 were 
destroyed.  A total of 1140 houses (1050 in the department of Leon 
and 90 in the province of Chinandega) lost their roofs.  Thousands 
of families were evacuated in the departments of Leon, Chinandega, 
Masaya, Managua and Rivas.  The majority of the evacuated were 
placed in 46 shelters in Leon and Chinandega.  Since May 30, most 
have returned to their homes. 
 
¶B.  Civil Defense requested emergency donations of food and roofing 
materials.  At Save the Children's request, USAID authorized the 
redirecting of up to 10% (22 MT) of Save the Children's P.L. 480 
Title II food commodities in stock. Save will distribute 5-day 
rations to 380 families. 
 
OFDA Team Conducted Assessment 
 
¶2. From May 30-31, a three-person OFDA team conducted an assessment in the affected departments. They determined that Leon and Chinandega had suffered the most damage and that the most urgent need was for roofing materials.
 
USAID Signed an Emergency Grant with Save the Children 
 
¶3. On May 31, USAID received a proposal from Save the Children to 
provide emergency assistance to the victims of Tropical Storm Alma. 
Save the Children has been working in the Chinandega department for 
six years implementing a USAID PL 480 Title II food security program 
in over 100 communities.  Save the Children also carried out an 
emergency USAID grant to respond to flooding in Chinandega in 
October 2007. 
 
¶4. On June 2, Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli, accompanied by Acting 
USAID Director Carol Horning, launched the $50,000 emergency grant 
with Save the Children to repair roofs in the departments of Leon 
and Chinandega.  The event was widely covered by the two main daily 
newspapers and national television.
