In Today's Papers 
 
Constitutional Court President: "It is impossible to give a date for 
the decision in the AKP Closure Case." 
Sabah, Milliyet, Hurriyet,Cumhuriyet, Radikal:  Constitutional Court 
President Hasim Kilic responded to Prime Minister Erdogan's remarks 
yesterday when the PM said, "The supreme court may issue its 
decision on the closure case of the AKP in the second half of July." 
 Kilic said it is not possible to predict if the decision will be 
made in early or late July.  Kilic said "I cannot make a prediction 
about the date.  Assessments in that regard have nothing to do with 
the court." 
 
PM Erdogan to Focus on Tuzla Shipyard Problems 
Radikal, Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Zaman, Star, Cumhuriyet:  Papers 
report that PM Erdogan will meet with ship owners and 
representatives of labor unions today to discuss work safety in 
Tuzla shipyard.  Transportation Minister Binali Yildirim will also 
attend the meeting. Liberal Radikal reminds that 25 workers have 
died in work accidents in Tuzla in the last six months.  Yesterday, 
Nur Istanbul shipyard was shut down for violating work safety 
regulations.   Papers draw attention to the fact that Turk-Is 
affiliated labor Unions are invited to the meeting while DISK's 
Limter-Is Union was excluded because they arranged the June 16th 
strike against worker deaths at the shipyard. 
 
A/S Fried Calls on Armenia to Recognize Turkey's Borders 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, and Zaman report on Assistant Secretary of State 
for European and Eurasian Affairs Dan Fried's statements at a House 
Foreign Affairs Committee meeting regarding the current 
Armenia-Turkish borders.  This is the first time a high-level U.S. 
official has made an official statement on the issue.  Papers 
interpret the statements as "for the first time, there are no 
territorial expectations from Turkey ."  Mainstream Hurriyet carries 
the headline, "A Historical Call from the U.S. to Armenia," saying 
that "The U.S. for the first time, emphasized Armenia has to 
recognize current borders with Turkey."   Mainstream Milliyet writes 
in "We don't say Genocide because we do not want to Harm Relations," 
that in response to a question on 1915 events, A/S Fried said "We 
have never denied the events of 1915, however as a policy, we don't 
use that term." 
 
Long-standing YouTube Ban Lifted Only for Hours 
Yeni Safak, Zaman, Radikal:  A court order blocking access to 
popular video-sharing web site You Tube was lifted on Tuesday night. 
 However, the web site remained open only for several hours and it 
was banned again around 10 a.m. Wednesday morning.  Turkish courts 
have recently issued several verdicts blocking access to offensive 
web sites.  You-Tube is the world's largest and most popular audio 
and video sharing web site and has become a symbol as access to it 
has frequently been prohibited by Turkish courts. 
 
Senator Obama Reiterates his Support for Armenian Resolution 
Hurriyet, Sabah, Milliyet,Zaman, Radikal:  Papers report Democratic 
Presidential Candidate Barack Obama sent a letter to the Armenian 
National Committee in the U.S. which said, "We should recognize the 
tragic facts.  There is no excuse for the Bush Administration not to 
recognize it." 
 
EDITORIAL OPINION: Middle East 
 
"A Bombardment of Good News" 
Sami Kohen wrote in mainstream Milliyet (6/19): "Unless a last 
minute problem occurs, today marks the beginning of peace in Gaza. 
The truce between Israel and the Hamas-led administration in Gaza 
was finally achieved through Egypt's mediation.  The ongoing clashes 
and reprisal attacks from both sides have been very painful for both 
Israel and Gaza.  Thus, they decided to try a ceasefire for six 
months, even though neither side trusts the other.  This agreement 
strengthens Hamas' hand, and in a way it creates an opportunity for 
 
ANKARA 00001145  002 OF 002 
 
 
Hamas to have its presence recognized.  It is not possible to expect 
that the ceasefire will last long.  Everybody knows that the 
ceasefire stands on very fragile ground.  In any case, it is worth 
trying because a peace brokered between Hamas and Israel is the most 
positive development in the Middle East recently.  In addition, 
Palestinian leader Abbas will visit Gaza this weekend for the first 
high-level contact between the two sides of Palestine.  Also, Israel 
has expressed its readiness to begin peace negotiations with 
Lebanon. Finally, Israel and Syria are continuing their talks with 
Turkey's mediation.  These are all good news developments for the 
region.  Bearing in mind the Middle East's nature, we can be 
cautiously optimistic." 
 
"The Ceasefire Is the Result of an Unsustainable Status Quo" 
Fikret Ertan wrote in Islamist leaning Zaman (6/19):  "Ever since 
Hamas' electoral victory in Gaza, the territory has been bombarded 
with constant air raids and other military activities by Israel. 
The Israeli government has faced internal protests and criticism. 
In the end, life in both Israel and Palestine has become unbearable. 
 The ceasefire agreement was reached because it was impossible to 
sustain stability under such conflict-ridden circumstances.  From 
now on, it will be very important to see two gates opened - the gate 
from Israel to Gaza, and the gate from Sufa to Karni.  These are the 
logistical and commercial gateways between Israel and Gaza.  In any 
case, southern Israel and Gaza will experience a significantly 
peaceful atmosphere.  Both Israel and Hamas will benefit from this 
period of relative comfort.  Let's hope this climate will lead to 
long-term and long-lasting agreements."
