Chavez's change in course 
 
Editorial in liberal Folha de S.Paulo (6/10) says: "[Hugo] Chavez's 
change in relation to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia 
(Farc) was so great that it surprised everyone.... He defended that 
the group should free all hostages and that Latin America has not 
place for guerillas any more.... But the president's move is better 
understood through Venezuela's internal politics.... A victory in 
[the] November [election] is seen as crucial for Chavez's plans to 
reintroduce, in 2010, a proposal to amend the Constitution in order 
to allow him to seek reelection indefinitely.... Even if for the 
wrong reasons it is good that he distances himself from the Farc. 
Equally - it is important to note that since the government's defeat 
in the December referendum which frustrated the president's attempt 
to obtain superpowers, politics has started to return to 
Venezuela."
