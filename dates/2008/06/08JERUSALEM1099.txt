SUBJECT: TWO MORTARS FIRED FROM GAZA; CROSSINGS CLOSED 
EXCEPT FOR FUEL, GRAIN/FEED SHIPMENTS 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Two mortars fired from Gaza struck open areas near 
Nahal Oz and Kfar 'Azza on June 27.  No injuries or damage 
resulted.  There were no claims of responsibility for the 
attack as of 1530 local. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Palestinian and NGO contacts report that Gaza Strip 
crossings were closed on June 27 except for the 
Karni/al-Mintar conveyer belt, which was open for animal feed 
and grain transfer, and the Nahal Oz fuel transfer station. 
The director of the Gaza Fuel Agency confirmed that Nahal Oz 
received a two days, supply of industrial fuel (600,000 
liters) for the Gaza power plant but no gasoline, diesel or 
cooking gas.  Around 15 medical patients with humanitarian 
permits were allowed through Erez on June 27. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Hamas leaders warned all factions against violating 
the ceasefire on June 26, and Hamas spokesman Tahir al-Nunu 
called violators "pawnbrokers of the Zionist occupation" who 
are "outside the national consensus."  Hamas spokesman Sami 
Abu Zuhri blamed "certain Fatah leaders in Ramallah" for 
firing rockets to serve factional interests and undermine 
Hamas.  Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades cells issued conflicting 
claims regarding June 26 Qassam fire, with multiple cells 
publicly claiming responsibility for the attack.  President 
Abbas issued a statement calling for all factions to abide by 
the ceasefire.  Nabil Amr, the PLO's Representative to Egypt, 
and Fatah leader Jibril Rajub also urged compliance with the 
ceasefire.
