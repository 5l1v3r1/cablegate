SUBJECT: U.S.-UN HIGH-LEVEL STRATEGIC DIALOGUE ON IRAQ - 
DRAFT AGENDA 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY and ACTION REQUEST:  The UN has proposed 
holding the next session of the UN-U.S. high level strategic 
dialogue on Iraq July 11 at UN headquarters in New York.  The 
UN presented a draft agenda to USUN June 26, proposing for 
the first time to treat both political and security subjects 
in a single day's session.  The UN-U.S. strategic dialogue on 
Iraq (usually held twice a year) began in late 2004, and is 
traditionally chaired by the UN Under-Secretary-General for 
Political Affairs and the State Department,s Coordinator for 
Iraq issues (S/I).  Background at para 2.  Draft agenda at 
para 3.  ACTION REQUEST:  USUN requests Department to provide 
feedback on the agenda and a proposed list of U.S. 
participants. END SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST. 
 
BACKGROUND 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Security Council authorized the formation of the 
UN Assistance Mission to Iraq (UNAMI) through Resolution 1500 
(August 2003).  On August 19, 2003, the UN Headquarters in 
Iraq was attacked, killing 22 people, including the UN,s 
Special Envoy Sergio de Mello.  The UN withdrew its staff, 
and did not begin returning until April 2004.  UNAMI staff 
returned in limited numbers, and based on the understanding 
that MNF-I would assist in their security, an arrangement 
addressed by UNSCR 1546 and subsequent MNF-I renewals and 
through a bilateral 607 agreement.  Although UNAMI has become 
more self-sufficient over time, it still depends heavily on 
MNF-I for security and transportation.  The strategic 
dialogue meetings serve several purposes: 1) to allow the 
U.S. and UN to compare notes on pressing political and 
security issues related to Iraq; 2) to ensure that the close 
coordination and cooperation with the UN in Baghdad is 
reinforced at headquarters level; and 3) to ensure that 
senior UN officials are assured of continued U.S. dedication 
to assisting with the UN's security needs.  U.S. participants 
typically include S/I, USUN, IO/UNP, and DoD for the security 
portion.  (Note:  Ambassador Khalilzad intends to participate 
in part of the discussion.)  UN participants typically 
include the UNAMI Special Representative to the 
Secretary-General, as well as senior Department of Political 
Affairs and Department of Safety and Security officials.  The 
UK Mission typically sends a note taker.  The political 
agenda focuses on issues related to UNAMI,s mandate as a 
special political mission (see UNSCR 1770); the mandate must 
be renewed by August 10.   The security portion treats both 
the security arrangements for the UN presence in Iraq and an 
exchange of views on the security situation.  Economic issues 
are traditionally addressed within the International Compact 
with Iraq; the first annual review was held in May in 
Stockholm and attended by Prime Minister Maliki, UN SYG Ban, 
Secretary Rice, and Treasury Deputy Secretary Bob Kimmitt, 
among others.
