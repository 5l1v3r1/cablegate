REF: STATE 64530 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) Poloff conveyed points and the updated P5 1 package 
for Iran (reftel) to Julian Juarez Cadenas, the Deputy 
Director General for UN-Related Security and Legal Issues at 
the Foreign Secretariat (SRE), on June 20.  Juarez commented 
that he hoped Iran would accept the package and a diplomatic 
agreement could be reached.  Juarez also said that it was his 
understanding that Iran had made a counterproposal.  He 
expressed concern, based on comments two weeks ago from the 
Israeli Defense Minister in which he said no options are off 
the table, that Israel could opt for a military response 
against Iranian nuclear facilities.
