¶1. (SBU) Per ref A demarche, D/Political Counselor met with 
Under Secretary-General for Safety and Security David Veness 
June 11 to request UN approval of a plan to provide IOM 
caseworkers with housing, office space and security coverage 
by the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. Veness said he had only 
received the plan the day before but based on his initial 
review he had concluded that he needed additional information 
from IOM. Specifically, he expressed concern that the plan 
divides security responsibility for the IOM caseworkers 
between the RSO office at the U.S. Embassy and UN unit for 
safety and security at the UNAMI compound. In principle, 
explained Veness, he opposed "split security plans" because 
they cause confusion regarding responsibilities and 
information flow. He said he would be consulting with IOM in 
the coming days about revising the current proposal. He said 
he would prefer that the United States assume full security 
responsibility for the IOM caseworkers. D/Political 
Counselor underscored U.S. support for the presence of the 
IOM caseworkers, and urged Veness to contact USUN with any 
follow-on concerns so the two sides could reach a 
satisfactory conclusion. She observed that there could be 
resource implications for a complete U.S. assumption of 
security responsibilities. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Turning to the subject of the upcoming U.S.-UN 
high-level dialogue on Iraq, currently scheduled for July 11, 
Veness noted that he would lead the security portion of the 
discussion. He confirmed that the UN is looking closely at 
the security arrangements for UNAMI following the end of 
MNF-I's mandate and will expect to discuss this matter during 
the July meeting. He relayed informally the UN's assessment 
that the Iraqi Security Forces will not be in a position to 
provide adequate security for UNAMI by the end of the year 
and said the UN would prefer continuation of the current 
security arrangements. He said he raised this topic with 
General Petraeus and DCM Butenis when last visiting Baghdad 
in February.
