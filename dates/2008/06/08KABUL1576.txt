SUBJECT: FARYAB: STABLE SECURITY, BUT PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS' 
PERFORMANCE IS MIXED 
¶1. (U) Summary:  Faryab suffered a severe winter and is currently 
suffering drought.  Faryab is generally secure.  Provincial 
governance performance remains mixed; the Governor and the 
 
Provincial Council President are positive forces, while other 
government institutions such as the provincial police and line 
ministries need improvement. 
Security: Stable but Fragile 
---------------------------- 
¶2. (SBU) Faryab security remains stable but fragile.  The two 
principal threats are: 
- Destabilizing activities by insurgents from Badghis's Ghormach 
district.  This activity has potential to stir up ethnic tensions 
between Badghis's Pashtuns and Faryab's Uzbeks.  It could escalate 
violence and inter-tribal retaliations. 
- Dostum's Junbesh Party.  While there have been no recent problems 
with Junbesh, it remains the major political force in the province 
and can quickly create protests and/or disturbances. 
¶3. (SBU) Radical Uzbeks from Ankhoi and Dawlatabad districts 
represent a growing security concern.  PRT Maymana believes some 
mosques in these districts have ties to the Islamic Movement of 
Uzbekistan (IMU) and Pakistan.  There are also indications that 
Uzbeks from these areas actively participate in the Badghis 
insurgency. 
¶4. (SBU) ANSF in Faryab consists of Afghan National Army (ANA) and 
Afghan National Police (ANP), which includes the Afghan Border 
Police (ABP).  The ANA is trusted, while the ANP and the ABP among 
them are less respected.  At PRT Maymana, the Norwegians are growing 
in capability and numbers.  They have added three helicopters to the 
PRT and plan to add more troops as RC North's Quick Reaction Force 
transitions from Norwegian to German troops. 
Development: Ring Road and Schools are Priorities 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
¶5. (U) Road clearing for the Ring Road is nearing completion and 
asphalting continues.  Electrical power is largely limited to the 
power line connecting Maymana to the Turkmenistan power grid. 
Norwegian funds will fund water and sanitation projects and rural 
development. 
 
¶6. (U) The Government of Norway (GoN) is paying special attention to 
school construction and teacher training.  It has budgeted funds for 
the construction of 82 primary schools for 2008 and another 140 in 
¶2009.  PRT Maymana has coordinated the school construction through 
the Ministry of Education.  The Norwegians will provide the funds to 
the Ministry of Education, which will then be responsible for the 
construction.  The GoN, through the Norwegian Refugee Council, is 
training teachers in Afghanistan's northern provinces.  Since they 
started the program, they have trained about 4000 teachers.  In 
2007, they trained 1130 teachers in Faryab. 
 
Governance: Shafaq is Effective, PTS is Broken 
--------------------------------------------- - 
¶7. (U) Governor Shafaq is involved in the details of governance.  He 
has proven adept at maintaining the provincial balance of power 
between GIRoA and Junbesh elements.  The Provincial Council (PC) is 
weak, poorly attended, and inactive.  Line ministry performance 
varies considerably.  The line ministry for Education is the most 
organized and effective.  Faryab suffered a severe winter and is 
currently suffering from a drought.  These back-to-back problems 
will test the provincial government if they lead to large-scale 
unemployment, internally displaced persons, and disputes over scarce 
resources. 
¶8. (SBU) The Program Takhim-E-Sohl (PTS) for insurgent 
reconciliation is weak at best; it is unclear if PTS officials have 
even visited the province.  To fill the void, PC President Jinab 
formed a Peace and Reconciliation Council.  Led by Jinab and 
consisting of provincial warlords, elders and other government 
officials, the council has attracted insurgents to negotiate with 
the government and participate in the Disarmament of Illegally Armed 
Groups progam. 
¶9. (U) PRT Maymana is very involved with Rule of Law (RoL) work. 
The GoN has assigned police advisors, prison advisors, and a legal 
advisor to monitor and mentor the provincial judicial system.  The 
PRT Legal Advisor says that there has been an 80 percent increase in 
the caseload heard by the provincial court system since Norwegian 
RoL efforts began in 2006.
