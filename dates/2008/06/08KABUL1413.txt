SECURITY SITUATION 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  The UK-led PRT in Lashkar Gah deployed a 
stabilization team to Garmsir on June 1.  The team is working with 
the district leadership to establish reconstruction and development 
priorities.  The District Administrator has established his office 
and is meeting with city residents and ISAF forces to support 
development activities.  Numerous shop owners returned to the 
central bazaar; families are returning to their abandoned compounds, 
and the city is coming back to life after the cessation of fighting. 
 The Afghan National Police (ANP) and Afghan Border Police (ABP) are 
working well with ISAF forces and coordinating joint patrols to 
expand their security footprint.  ISAF's recent military success has 
created an opportunity for GIRoA to extend its control over Garmsir 
district. 
 
Garmsir Stabilization 
--------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The PRT's stabilization team deployed to Garmsir on June 1 
and immediately met with district leadership to establish 
reconstruction and development priorities.  The District 
Administrator, Abdullah Jan, told PRT officers that local residents 
welcomed ISAF operations and were eager to return to their homes. 
He said many of the enemy forces who had controlled the area were 
foreigners and treated local residents badly.  The insurgents forced 
local residents to provide housing and food, and many farmers had 
been unable to harvest their crops because of the constant fighting. 
 Jan said local residents needed clarification from UK and U.S. 
forces so they would know which roads were open and cleared of 
explosives.  He agreed to meet regularly with ISAF commanders to 
review the cleared routes. 
 
Need for Additional Governance and Security Personnel 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
¶3. (SBU) Jan said he needs staff from Helmand line ministries to 
build governance capacity.  He has contacted Governor Mangal to 
address this and other governance and security needs.  The Chief of 
Police, Colonel Gulli, is from the Garmsir area, and he and his men 
have the local knowledge to stop the enemy force from infiltrating 
back into the city.  Jan said the ANP and ABP have a good working 
relationship and are manning checkpoints and patrolling with ISAF. 
Jan said he has about 70 ANP and about 95 ABP to support ISAF 
efforts, but he has asked Mangal for Afghan National Army forces to 
expand the security area around the city. 
 
Reconstruction: Hospital and Bazaar are Priorities 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
¶4. (SBU) The stabilization team discussed reconstruction priorities 
with local residents who most frequently requested repairs to the 
city hospital and central bazaar.  The city hospital is rundown but 
structurally sound, and with cleaning and renovation could be 
operational in weeks.  The stabilization team's medical staff worked 
with the local doctor and his staff at the facility to compile a 
list of needed medical supplies.  Residents also requested the 
reopening of the bazaar as soon as possible so they could buy food 
and other needed items.  Lashkar Gah is 60 kilometers away; many 
residents said they could not make this trip and were running low on 
supplies.  There are several hundred shop stalls at the central 
bazaar, most in useable condition, and at least a dozen shop owners 
had reopened their shops.  The PRT stabilization team is working 
closely with the U.S. Marine Corps civil affairs team to coordinate 
development activities and develop a comprehensive reconstruction 
plan for Garmsir. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: The deployment of the stabilization team to 
Garmsir was welcomed by UK and U.S. forces so the reconstruction and 
development program could move forward.  The stabilization team's 
medical, engineer and governance officers worked with local 
officials to build an initial plan based on local needs to help 
support the return of city residents.  With sustained transport and 
security support from ISAF, this stabilization effort can deliver 
better conditions to the local population very quickly after the 
conclusion of military operations.       Early establishment of a 
central government presence in the district, as both security 
provider and dispenser of development aid and services, is key to 
securing this area from re-infiltration by insurgents.
