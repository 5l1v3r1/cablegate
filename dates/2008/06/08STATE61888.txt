 ¶1.  This is an action request.  The Department instructs 
USUN to deliver the letter in para 2 below to the UN 
Electoral Assistance Division as soon as possible.  No 
original will follow.  A follow-up letter will be supplied 
once the funds can be formally obligated.  The follow-up 
letter will include the terms and conditions of the award, 
and will require UN acknowledgment of the award.  End action. 
 
 
¶2.  Begin text of letter: 
 
Dear Mr. Jenness, 
 
Thank you for your letter dated May 21, 2008, which requested 
U.S. financial support for the United Nations Trust Fund for 
Electoral Assistance.  We appreciate the United Nations 
Electoral Assistance Division,s effort to support the rapid 
deployment of election observers from the African Union (AU) 
and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) for the 
second round of Zimbabwe,s presidential elections scheduled 
for June 27, 2008. 
 
The United States intends to contribute $1.35 million to the 
United Nations Trust Fund for Electoral Assistance to support 
election observation for the June 27 run-off election in 
Zimbabwe.  We will send to you very shortly another letter 
that will be used as an award of the funds, but we are still 
in the process of making the funds available so they can be 
formally obligated. 
 
Again, we thank you for your efforts in supporting the AU and 
SADC in their mission to observe the run-off election in 
Zimbabwe.  We will watch the election process carefully, and 
believe the AU and SADC election observers can help ensure 
that the election proceeds smoothly in a fair and transparent 
fashion. 
 
Sincerely, 
Kristen Silverberg
