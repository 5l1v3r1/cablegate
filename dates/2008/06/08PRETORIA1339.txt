of the Government of Burundi was headed by Major-General 
Evariste Ndayishimiye.

achieve this progress; 
 
Strongly commended both parties on the return to Burundi of

Joint Verification and Monitoring Mechanism (JVMM) on 19 May; 
the conclusion of the joint declaration on the cessation of 
hostilities on 26 May; and the adoption on 2 June of the

achievements and ongoing efforts of the Regional Initiative

Fully respect the timeliness outlined in the Revised

   issues, including the political accommodation of the 
   PALIPEHUTU-FNL in national institutions as well as their 
   integration in the defence and security forces 
-- Ensure that the resolution of these issues would not be 
   used in any way as a precondition for implementing the 
   JVMM Programme of Action and the Joint Operational Plan 
-- Take specific initiatives in order to sensitize the 
   national institutions, Palipehutu-FNL members, and the 
   population on the ongoing peace process 
-- Refrain from any inflammatory action or declaration 
-- Endeavour to find as soon as possible a mutually 
   acceptable solution to the question of the registration
