SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN PRE-LICENSE END USE CHECK ON 
APPLICATION 05-050103848 
 
¶1.  This is an action message.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2.  The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post assistance in conducting a 
pre-license check for the export of power modules to Ukraine 
via Russia.  Post is requested to complete this Blue Lantern 
check within 30 days.  Lack of response to a Blue Lantern 
check will affect pending and future licenses involving 
parties to this license. 
 
¶3.  Reason for request: license application documents 
indicate that the requested components are to be incorporated 
into a static converter for use on an AN-70 transport 
aircraft.  These documents, however, do not specify the final 
end-user of the aircraft.  The power modules are United 
States Munitions List (USML) commodities.  Restrictions of 
the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) prohibits the re-transfer 
or re-export of USML commodities without express USG 
authorization. 
 
¶4.  ACTION: Please contact the Foreign Consignee, Aviant 
State Aviation Plant, and the Foreign End User, ASTC ANTONOV. 
 Ask each company to explain the end use of the static 
converter that will contain the USML components.  Will this 
static converter be used in a single AN-70, or for testing 
purposes on several aircraft?  If the static converter is 
intended for permanent installation on one AN-70, who will be 
the ultimate end-user of this particular aircraft?  Ask 
Aviant and Antonov if they understand the restrictions on 
USML commodities, and the prohibition against re-transfer or 
re-export without express USG authorization.  END ACTION.
