SUBJECT: SLM-UNITY AND SAF BOTH CLAIM VICTORY IN NORTH DARFUR FIGHT 
 
 
¶1. (U)  SUMMARY:  Fighting between SLM-Unity and Sudanese Armed 
Forces broke out on June 8 in North Darfur State.  SLM-Unity 
representatives claimed victory, alleging that they killed more than 
150 SAF soldiers and destroyed dozens of SAF vehicles.  SAF reported 
they suffered only fourteen casualties and that GoS forces now 
control the area.  A second, separate clash may have taken place the 
following day near the Libyan border.  END SUMMARY. 
 
SLM-UNITY DECLARES VICTORY

¶2.  (U)  On June 8, the spokesman for SLM-Unity, Mahgoub Hussein 
issued a press release on sudaneseonline.com declaring that 
SLM-Unity succeeded in a military ambush on SAF between El Taweisha 
and Gussa Jammat (approximately 200 km southeast of El Fasher in Um 
Kadada locality of North Darfur State.)  According to the statement, 
SLM-Unity killed 157 SAF soldiers, seized five vehicles, and 
destroyed SAF equipment including 19 military vehicles filled with 
supplies, ammunition and some "internationally banned weapons 
including cluster bombs."   The statement reports that SLM-Unity 
lost seven of its fighters in the combat.  Chief Commander of 
SLM-Unity, Abu-Bakr Kado, later told the international press that 
the fighting continued for approximately three hours and that "We 
fought them [SAF] because the government forces entered our 
territories." 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  On June 11, SLM-Unity leaders Osman Bushra and Sayed 
Sharif confirmed in separate phone conversations with emboffs that 
heavy fighting between SLM-Unity and SAF occurred on June 8. 
According to these sources, SAF forces provoked the fight by moving 
into SLM-Unity "liberated areas" on June 8.  Bushra stated that 
SLM-Unity killed approximately 150 soldiers, destroyed 80 vehicles, 
and captured 8 others.  According to Bushra, the commander of the 
SAF forces escaped with approximately ten vehicles, and SLM-Unity 
suffered six casualties and fourteen wounded. 
 
SAF: WE ARE IN CONTROL OF THE AREA

¶4.  (U)  Also on June 11, most Sudanese newspapers carried a 
statement from the Sudanese Armed Forces, stating that it repelled 
an ambush planned by the SLM-Unity in Um Kadada locality of North 
Darfur. General Mohamed Al Aghbash, the SAF Spokesman, said that the 
SAF forces lost 14 soldiers in the ambush, but succeeded in driving 
SLM-Unity away from the area which SAF had completely secured.  The 
SAF Spokesman stated that SLM-Unity left "a very big number of 
killed and injured behind in the attack, and a large quantity of 
military equipment which is still being inventoried."  Al Aghbash 
called other reports on the attack "baseless," as "SLM-Unity always 
attempts to exaggerate in the media, while the facts on the ground 
confirm their fleeing and huge loss both in terms of resources and 
personnel." 
 
OTHER REPORTS FROM SLM-MM AND UNAMID 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
¶5.  (SBU)  SLM-Minni Minnawi (SLM-MM) contacts in North Darfur told 
fieldoffs on June 10 that the fighting took place in a 
GoS-controlled area, close to SLA-MM areas.  According to these 
sources, SLA-Unity approached the area, but a SLA-MM commander 
there, Abdalla Mohamedin, told SLA-Unity to leave the area.  GoS 
soon learned of SLA-Unity's presence and subsequently attacked, and 
according to this SLM-MM source the GoS was "severely defeated." 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  UNAMID's unofficial description of the fighting aligns 
more closely with official GoS figures.  According to the J3 sector 
commander in the morning briefing on June 11, SLM-Unity killed 14 
SAF troops, including a colonel, wounded 35 others, and took 19 APCs 
in the fighting [NOTE: The Ceasefire Commission later told FieldOff 
no/no APCs had been taken in the fighting -a report that appears 
more plausible- but the CFC has yet to conduct an investigation in 
this remote region.  END NOTE].  According to these UNAMID reports 
quoting GoS sources, 106 SLM-Unity fighters died in the attack. 
These UNAMID sources also stated that GoS reportedly dispatched 
Antonovs to bomb areas in the region in the aftermath of the 
fighting. 
 
¶7.  (SBU)  COMMENT:  Conflicting reports are not unusual coming in 
the vast and isolated landscape of Darfur.  The numbers of dead, 
wounded, and captured vehicles, in addition to the reference to APCs 
taken by SLM-Unity, should all be taken with a grain of salt. 
Although the figures are in dispute, all reports agree, at the very 
least, that significant fighting between SLM-Unity and SAF took 
place on June 8.  If the SAF sustained losses even half of the 
SLM-Unity reports, then reprisal attacks can be expected, including 
aerial bombardment and Janjaweed attacks.  There are also rumors of 
another clash between SLM-Unity and the GoS on June 9 close to the 
Libyan border in which SLM-Unity once again overwhelmed the SAF.  If 
such reports are true, it would indicate a level of command and 
control within SLM-Unity sophisticated enough to coordinate
