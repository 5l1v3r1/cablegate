¶1. (SBU) This cable is Sensitive but Unclassified.  Not for

¶2. (SBU) The second meeting of Special Envoys on Burundi was 
held in Magaliesberg, South Africa June 9-10, 2008.  The SAG 
Minister of Safety and Security, Charles Nqakula, hosted this 
meeting along with the SAG Special Envoy Ambassador Kingsley 
Mamabolo.  Agathon Rwasa led the PALIPEHUTU-FNL delegation, 
and Major-General Evariste Ndayishimiye headed the Government 
of Burundi delegation. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The first Special Envoys meeting was held in Cape 
Town, South Africa in February 2008.   Unlike the Cape Town 
meeting, called in an atmosphere of hopelessness as Burundi 
again was plunged into crisis, the Magaliesberg meeting 
represented a "good story" with "a good ending," according to 
Mamabolo. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In the month preceding the Magaliesberg meeting, 
significant developments occurred in the Burundi peace 
process.  Chairman Agathon Rwasa and elements of the 
PALIPEHUTU-FNL leadership returned to Burundi.  The work of 
the Joint Verification and Monitoring Mechanism (JMVV) 
resumed.  A new cessation of hostilities agreements between 
the parties was signed and the Joint Operational Plan on the 
disarmament, demobilization, and the reintegration of 
PALIPEHUTU-FNL combatants was adopted (reftels).  These 
agreements laid out the framework of mutual commitments for 
both parties "to build confidence and move the peace process 
forward." 
 
¶5. (SBU) Following the second Special Envoys meeting, the 
Magaliesberg Communique and Declaration on the Burundi Peace 
Process (septel) were announced which set forth the areas of 
agreement between the parties and the pledges of support from 
the Envoys. 
 
¶6. (SBU) The Special Envoys noted that the two parties now 
hold common views on the causes and consequences of the 
conflict as well as key socio-economic challenges facing 
Burundi.  They applauded recent achievements of the South 
African facilitation as well as the SAG's financial and 
military assistance.  The contributions of international 
partners in support of the Burundi peace process were also 
acknowledged.  They pledged to continue leveraging 
international resources to financially support the SAG 
Facilitation and the Burundi peace process, including 
"...interceding with donors on the provision of humanitarian 
assistance until the conclusion of the disarmament, 
demobilization, and reintegration process.  The Special 
Envoys will also continue to support the PALIPEHUTU-FNL 
transformation into a political party, including the training 
of its members.  They will "pay special attention to the 
reintegration aspects of the disarmament, demobilization, and 
reintegration" of the PALIPEHUTU-FNL; and agreed to consider 
ways of providing additional support to the Government of 
Burundi "to address the pressures caused by rising prices of 
food and fuel." 
 
¶7. (SBU) Mamabolo also noted with the PALIPEHUTU-FNL's return 
and the peace process itself had implications for funding 
support.  He noted, "Just to monitor it you have to create 
the Joint Liaison Team (JLT) to monitor the violation of the 
ceasefire."  He also mentioned long term structural 
Qceasefire."  He also mentioned long term structural 
challenges that will require international support, including 
humanitarian and many other needs, the return of refugees, 
settling displaced persons, and the critical demobilization 
and disarmament of the PALIPEHUTU-FNL combatants, and post 
conflict reconstruction. 
 
¶8. (SBU) COMMENT:  The tone of the meeting was decidedly 
upbeat.  Although Rwasa reiterated many of his side's 
familiar doctrinaire demands like retaining the 
constitutionally prohibited PALIPEHUTU-FNL as the name for 
 
PRETORIA 00001392  002 OF 002 
 
 
his political party, most of the participants agreed that it 
seemed as if everything could be open for discussion.  The 
South African facilitators said they were pleased with the 
progress made at the meeting, but were quick to note that the 
price of peace was high and they were the ones picking up 
much of the tab.  They appealed for help from the 
international community to defray some of their expenses, 
transmitting to participants by e-mail on June 19 an 
operating budget listing expediters and requirements for 
additional resources (reftel).  The meeting closed, to the 
surprise of most, with a Rwasa-initiated prayer circle - all 
at the conference joining hands to hear Rwasa's 20-minute 
appeal for peace and understanding.  The press was admitted 
to listen and to tape the closing event.
