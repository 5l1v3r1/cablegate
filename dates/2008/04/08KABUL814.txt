REF: NEGROPONTE - SASAE MEMCON 
-- 
¶1.  (SBU)  On March 30 the Charge, accompanied by EconCouns, 
reviewed with visiting Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister Ken Sasae 
and Japanese Ambassador to Afghanistan Hideo Sato Japan's plans for 
assistance to Afghanistan.  Sasae reaffirmed Japan's commitment to 
completing its portion of the Kandahar to Herat Ring Road, and 
acknowledged its symbolic and practical significance.  He welcomed 
Kai Eide's appointment as the Senior Representative of the Secretary 
General (SRSG) in Kabul, and was scheduled to see Eide later that 
day. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) In discussing the Afghanistan Support Conference in Paris, 
Sasae expressed special interest in the training of Afghan National 
Police (ANP), and implied that Japan would be making a contribution 
to the Law and Order Trust Fund for Afghanistan (LOTFA) as part of 
its Paris pledge.  Although Japanese police are not suited for 
training in Afghanistan, Japan is willing to provide both police 
equipment and specialized training of Afghans in Japan.  Japan will 
send a police delegation to Kabul to better understand the ANP's 
needs, and would appreciate the assistance of the Combined Security 
Transition Command - Afghanistan (CSTC-A) in arranging their 
meetings. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Sasae responded enthusiastically when the Charge offered 
to host a delegation of Japanese reporters to Afghanistan similar to 
the previous delegations from NATO countries.  Sasae agreed that it 
is important to "get out the story of what is going right" in 
Afghanistan.
