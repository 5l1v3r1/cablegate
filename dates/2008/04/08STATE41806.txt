¶1.    This is an action request.  Please see para. 6 
 
¶2.    Background:  The UN Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) is the UN 
peacekeeping operation mandated to monitor and support 
implementation of Sudan,s historic Comprehensive Peace 
Agreement (CPA), which ended 21 years of civil war between 
northern and southern Sudan when it was signed on January 9, 
¶2005. Under the CPA, the parties to the agreement (e.g. the 
National Congress Party (NCP) and the Sudan Peoples 
Liberation Movement (SPLM)) are provided a six-year interim 
period during which a census, national elections, and a 
referendum on the South,s determination to secede or remain 
part of a united Sudan will take place.  Sudan,s national 
census, a milestone under the CPA, is scheduled to take place 
April 22 ) May 6.  Also, the international community is 
eagerly anticipating planning for the 2009 national 
elections.  Sudan,s disputed oil-rich border region of Abyei 
continues to see an escalation of tension and violence 
between local Misseriya tribes, local Dinka Ngok, the Sudan 
People,s Liberation Army (SPLA), and Sudan Armed Forces 
(SAF) elements, as the Presidency continues dialogue on 
resolving the problem. 
 
¶3.    Two key positions within UNMIS are undergoing 
transition.  The position of Deputy Senior Representative of 
the Secretary General (D/SRSG), formerly held/soon to be 
vacated by Taye Zerihoun, has not been officially filled.  In 
addition, the tour of UN Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) Force 
Commander Lt. General Jasbir Singh Lidder ended on/about 
April 8, 2008 (reftel A,B).  The loss of UNMIS staff is 
particularly unfortunate at this time when respected 
leadership is crucial to fulfillment of the UNMIS mandate 
amidst civil and military challenges. 
 
¶4.    The Department is unaware of formal announcements 
related to the replacement of either position, but has heard 
rumors about and received endorsements for potential 
candidates.  The Washington SPLM mission reported to the 
Department its understanding that Mr. Azouz Ennifar, D/SRSG 
for the UNMEE mission, would replace Zerihoun and expressed 
its concern over the appointment of a Muslim individual given 
the tense Muslim/Christian environment in Sudan (Note: The 
SPLM was equally disappointed with the appointment of SRSG 
Qazi because of his Muslim religious and cultural 
affiliation; the SPLM was not consulted on his appointment, 
either.  End note).  With respect to the replacement of FC 
Lidder, the Department has not been informed of potential 
candidates, but has received requests to endorse at least one 
West African military commander (reftel C).  While we are 
taking these comments on board, we do not see any reason to 
break with our usual policy in this case.  Proposed TALKING 
POINTS: 
 
z     UNMIS is making a difference on the ground in Southern 
Sudan, due in large part to the presence of capable and 
competent staff. 
 
z     The continued provision of such fully functioning and 
capable UNMIS staff is crucial for implementation of the CPA, 
as well as for maintaining the achievements of the UNMIS 
operation thus far. 
 
z     The D/SRSG and FC positions cannot remain vacant during 
this critical period.  Moreover, they should be filled by 
individuals capable of undertaking the massive 
responsibilities of the CPA, including possessing the ability 
to work productively with the constituents of the CPA, namely 
the SPLM. 
 
z     With respect to the UNMIS FC, an appropriate candidate 
must be capable of moving forward on creative peacekeeping 
initiatives, such as the nascent JIU support cell (reftel D), 
and making progress amidst difficult circumstances, such as 
monitoring efforts in Abyei and increasing violence in 
Kordofan (reftel E). 
 
z     We recognize the complex difficulties associated with 
UNMIS and Sudan generally, but encourage the UN nonetheless 
to remain committed to a fully operational UNMIS.  End 
points.

¶5.    ACTION USUN:  Drawing from the Background and suggested 
Talking Points, Post is requested to approach the UN 
Secretariat and obtain information on prospective candidates 
 
SIPDIS 
and a timeline for  the replacement of both D/SRSG Zerihoun 
and UNMIS FC Lidder.  USUN is requested to underscore to the 
Secretariat the importance of finding appropriate and 
 
SIPDIS 
competent replacements for these individuals.
