REF: DAMASCUS 236 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Department appreciates Post's update on Iraqi 
refugee resettlement (reftel). 
 
¶2.  (SBU) PRM and DHS/USCIS authorize GSO or a contractor to 
drill additional tennis ball-sized holes in the Plexiglass in 
each interview room to facilitate better communication.  We 
understand this will cost approximately 800 USD and require 
roughly 8 hours of labor to be done after hours.  PRM also 
authorizes the purchase of approximately 150 USD of local 
rugs to hang on the walls of the interview rooms to improve 
acoustics.  PRM will provide funding via IOM and we will ask 
IOM to coordinate directly with the Embassy regarding payment 
for the contractors and rugs. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) PRM has discussed UNHCR,s proposal to change the 
DHS work week to allow UNHCR to have access to the interview 
rooms for one additional Syrian work day with DHS/USCIS and 
IOM.  All are in agreement to implement a Monday-Friday DHS 
interview schedule starting on May 5.
