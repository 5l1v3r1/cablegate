IRAQ 
 
REF: BRUSSELS 0533 
 
(SBU) Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki's April 16 meetings in 
Brussels will, according to EU officials, send a strong 
signal that the EU is engaging on and committed to Iraq. 
Maliki and his entourage, including the Foreign Minister, Oil 
Minister, Interior Minister, Defense Minister and National 
Security Advisor, among others, will meet with EU Council 
HiRep Solana, Commission President Barroso, Slovenian 
Presidency FM Rupel, and European Parliament President 
Poettering.  Following his meeting with Poettering he will 
address the European Parliament Foreign Affairs Committee. 
Contacts said the EU has no enormous expectations for the 
visit, but they will use this opportunity to reinforce 
messages on the importance of political inclusiveness and to 
reiterate EU commitment to Iraq.  UN Special Representative 
for Iraq Staffan Di Mistura's April 11 briefing to the 
Council's Political and Security Committee will serve as 
curtain raiser for the Maliki visit.  The Maliki visit will 
also serve to inform the EU prior to the April 29 meeting of 
EU Foreign Ministers (GAERC), where they will review progress 
in Iraq.
