SUBJECT: BAHRAIN: DESIGNATION OF FUTURE BANK 
 
REF: A. STATE 27642 B. MANAMA 130 Classified By: Ambassador Adam Ereli for reasons 1.4(b) and (d).

1.(C) Econoff conveyed ref A non-paper regarding the March 12 U.S. domestic designation of Future Bank to MFA Director of Bilateral Affairs Dr. Dhafer Alumran March 23 and met to follow up with him March 27. Alumran told Econoff the GOB would consider the USG's request, but could provide no assurances that Bahrain would take further action against Future Bank.

2.(C) Comment: The GOB considered moving against Future Bank (ref B) in order to forestall U.S. designation, but in the end failed to take action. We believe that in the end, the GOB concluded that taking on Iran by moving against Future Bank at this time was more than the traffic of the Bahrain-Iran relationship could bear. ********************************************* ******** Visit Embassy Manama's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX********************************************* ******** ERELI
