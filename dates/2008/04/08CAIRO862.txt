¶1. (SBU)  Israa Abdel Fattah, a young Ghad party member 
detained since April 6 for allegedly inciting a general 
strike on the same day, was released the evening of April 23. 
 Abdel Fattah was reportedly ordered released on April 14 by 
the Public Prosecutor, but was kept in "protective custody" 
by the Ministry of Interior until April 23, when the 
government news agency announced that Minister of Interior 
Habib Al Adli ordered her release on humanitarian grounds. 
She originally called for the April 6 strike on the internet 
social networking site Facebook (reftel), and the Facebook 
group she launched attracted almost 70,000 members. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Following her release, Abdel Fattah appeared on two 
evening TV talk shows, where she apologized "for what I did," 
and said that she does not support and will not participate 
in a general strike planned for May 4, or any future such 
initiatives.  (Note: Facebook activists are calling for this 
strike to protest against rising prices, symbolically held on 
President Mubarak's eightieth birthday.  The Facebook group 
devoted to the strike has over 20,000 members thus far.  End 
note).  Abdel Fattah noted that she hoped to depart Cairo on 
April 24 for the umra pilgrimage to Mecca.  She also urged 
the authorities to release "the other 21 youth who are still 
imprisoned on charges of participation in the April 6 
strike."  In response to a question as to whether she would 
check her Facebook account anytime soon, she replied, "I 
don't think so." 
 
¶3. (SBU) We have as yet not been successful in our efforts to 
contact Abdel Fattah's lawyer.  Thus, it remains unclear to 
us whether the charges against Abdel Fattah were dropped, or 
whether she may still face trial. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment: By detaining Abdel Fattah for two and a 
half weeks, and allowing her chastened appearance on TV so 
soon after her release, the Egyptian authorities are clearly 
sending a warning message to other young on-line activists 
that their virtual activities can have all to real 
consequences.  It remains to be seen whether Abdel Fattah's 
experience casts a measurable chill over the burgeoning 
online activist community.
