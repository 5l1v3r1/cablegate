In Today's Papers 
 
PM Erdogan's Message from Sweden 
Milliyet, Sabah, Hurriyet, Turkiye, Zaman:  Mainstream Sabah reports 
that during his meetings in Sweden, PM Erdogan said, "The 
Constitutional Court will do its job and we (AKP) will do our job to 
prepare our defense."  Conservative-nationalist Turkiye reports that 
Erdogan commented on Turkey's relationship with the EU, "We are 
looking for political and economic stability in Turkey.  Turkey will 
utilize its experience as a democracy to overcome its troubles.  EU 
membership is a strategic goal for us."  Islamist-oriented Zaman 
reports, "The AKP government has changed its strategy.  They are 
focusing on EU reforms instead of constitutional amendments. 
Mainstream Hurriyet reports that prior to EU Commissioner Barosso's 
visit to Turkey on next week, EU officials warned, "Barosso will 
emphasize the EU's concerns regarding the party closure case. 
However, Barosso will also emphasize that secularism is as important 
as democracy." 
 
Meanwhile, Mainstream Hurriyet reports that PM Erdogan's visit to 
Stockholm was met with protests from PKK supporters, Armenians and 
Assyrians.  On his way to the Swedish Parliament, eggs were hurled 
at PM Erdogan's motorcade during protests by Armenians and the 
Assyrians.  Once he arrived at the Swedish Parliament, a group of 
PKK supporters staged a demonstration and displayed photos of jailed 
PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan. 
 
EDITORIAL OPINION:  AKP Closure Case 
 
In Islamist-leaning Yeni Safak, Ali Bayramoglu wrote (4/3): "Since 
2005, EU reforms have been neglected.  However, the AKP government 
can overcome its problems by sticking to the EU reform process. 
Democratization is the key to solving these problems.  A civilian 
and democratic constitution should be prepared as quickly as 
possible and taken to the people for a referendum." 
 
Hasan Cemal wrote in mainstream Milliyet (4/3): "Some circles in 
Turkey are very skeptical about democratic values according to EU 
standards; thus they advocate fear that an EU-style democracy would 
weaken Turkey by paving the way for internal division and the loss 
of secularism.  These circles seem to be enjoying themselves because 
the court case against AKP damage Turkey's EU accession process. 
However, separatism and radical Islam will become a significant 
threat to Turkey if we turn our backs on democracy and the EU 
process.  Prime Minister Erdogan should initiate reforms in line 
with EU standards and he should take efforts toward eliminating 
secularism-related anxieties." 
 
In mainstream Sabah, managing editor Ergun Babahan wrote (4/3): 
"First of all we should look at the current situation with a broader 
perspective.  On one hand, there is an attempted coup against the 
democratic process, but on the other hand, the EU process has become 
all but insignificant during the AKP's second term.  Because the AKP 
has neglected the EU process, worries about 'the AKP's secret 
agenda' have increased.  Therefore, part of society feels discomfort 
and uneasiness toward the AKP.  The current attempts against the 
regime can be eliminated by broadening freedoms and eliminating 
worries.  A Western-style democratic system is the best way to turn 
this crisis into an opportunity." 
 
EDITORIAL OPINION:  Trade Between Turkey and Iraq 
 
Meliha Okur wrote in mainstream Sabah (4/3): "There has been an 
important development regarding the oil trade.  South Korea and the 
northern Iraqi Regional Kurdish Administration signed an agreement 
concerning rights for oil and natural gas resources in northern 
Iraq.  Given the fact that South Korea has been a part of the 
occupying forces in Iraq since 2003, the northern Iraqi 
administration did not see any harm in signing a deal with one of 
the occupying forces.  Then, we should ask why and for what is 
 
ANKARA 00000629  002 OF 003 
 
 
Turkey still waiting?  Turkey has to wake up immediately and move 
forward on trade opportunities with Iraq." 
 
301 Will Be Annulled Soon 
Radikal, Hurriyet, Sabah, Milliyet, Cumhuriyet, Vatan and others: 
Mainstream Sabah reports PM Erdogan spoke about Article 301 during 
his meetings in Sweden.  He said, "The bill changing Article 301 
will be brought to Parliament after the draft law on Social Security 
is adopted."  Liberal Radikal's headline reads, "Yet Another Promise 
from the Government." Reportedly, Justice Minister Mehmet Ali Sahin 
told AKP members that the amended bill will be submitted to 
parliament next week.  Radikal adds that PM Erdogan told his 
contacts in Stockholm that Article 301 will be amended very soon. 
 
Court of Appeals Chief Prosecutor's Press Office Warning 
All papers report that Court of Appeals (Yargitay) Chief 
Prosecutor's Press Office announced that legal steps will be taken 
against those who say or publish insulting or threatening statements 
against the Court of Appeals Chief Prosecutor and those who aim to 
influence the trial process. 
 
NATO Summit, President Gul's Remarks 
All media outlets carry President Gul's refusal to send combat 
troops to Afghanistan yesterday and the opening of the NATO Summit 
in Bucharest.  Mainstream Aksam writes, "The NATO summit's main 
priorities are to increase the combat forces in Afghanistan and to 
enhance the missile defense program in Eastern Europe," and 
President Gul noted, "As you know, Turkey is very involved in 
Afghanistan and will remain involved, but we will not send combat 
troops.  We are prepared to help with civilian and reconstruction 
support."  In "Another 'No' to the U.S.," mainstream Hurriyet 
writes, "President Gul reiterated Turkey has no intention to send 
combat troops to Afghanistan."  In "No Combat Troops to 
Afghanistan," liberal Radikal writes, "Gul's Shield Is Hot," which 
is a saying in Turkish which means, "Gul is ready to fight back," 
against demands for more combat troops in Afghanistan.  Islamist- 
oriented Zaman draws attention to the fact that "Ankara's 
fundamental point" at the summit was to communicate that, "Afghans 
are our allies and friends, and we will not fight against the Afghan 
people." 
 
Meanwhile, mainstream Hurriyet reports that President Bush warned 
the world at the NATO Summit by saying, "If additional troops are 
not sent to Afghanistan, another attack, like September 11, is 
inevitable."  President Bush also stressed that 'despite Moscow's 
rejection, Ukraine and Georgia are ready for NATO membership."
