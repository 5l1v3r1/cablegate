SUBJECT: REQUEST CLARIFICATION ON FOIA REQUEST: RECORDS OF ALL 
FINANCIAL PAYMENTS SINCE JANUARY 1, 2006 
 
Ref:  A) Triner-O'Herron 2/28/08 and 3/4/08 e-mails 
 
B) State 14436 
 
¶1. (SBU) Per ref A exchanges with the Department, post requests 
clarification of ref B Freedom of Information Act request from Mara 
Verheyden-Hilliard on behalf of the Venezuela Solidarity Network. 
The request asks for "copies of all records regarding all grants, 
payments, and/or funds transfers to individuals, groups or political 
parties in Argentina from January 1, 2006 to the present."  Post's 
Financial Management Office has determined that these search 
criteria -- as presently defined -- would require providing copies 
of records of thousands of payments made by the Embassy to 
individuals and groups.  Since the cost of the search is borne by 
the requester, post reiterates its request to the Department that it 
ask Verheyden-Hilliard to redefine the search criteria. 
 
¶2. (U) Thank you for your assistance.
