Main Stories: 
------------- 
The front pages of the dailies report existence of an "Israeli plan 
to invade Gaza."  Al-Ayyam reports that, "Israel plans to hand over 
the Gaza Strip to Egypt or a third party."  Dailies also note that, 
"Tel Aviv threatened that Hamas will pay a high price," especially 
in response to recent killings of Israeli soldiers near Gaza.  Al 
Quds' front page attributes the threat to a statement by Israeli 
Prime Minister Olmert.  Meanwhile, all papers report that Hamas 
called upon its members, "to target and hit the enemy everywhere. 
Al-Ayyam adds that Hamas announced that, "the zero hour for [Gaza] 
exploding is coming soon".  Reports also continue to highlight the 
effects of the fuel shortage in Gaza and run quotes by former 
president Carter that describe Israeli actions in Gaza as "a crime 
and a savage act." 
 
Front page reports announce that, "Israel heightens security," ahead 
of the Passover holiday and will seal its borders with the West Bank 
from April 17 to April 27.  The front page of Al-Hayat Al-Jadida 
reports that "Washington is worried about the violence in the Middle 
East." Related reports in all papers highlight warnings by the Arab 
League about the consequences of Israel's "ethnic cleansing war" 
against Palestinians and "hunger policy against Gaza." 
 
The front pages of Al-Quds and Al-Ayyam carry photos of Palestinian 
President Abbas during a lecture at the Moscow State Institute of 
International Relations on April 17.  Abbas said that, "the 
conference planned for Moscow in June must rescue the peace 
process."  The dailies also highlight that Abbas insisted that 
"Israel is placing obstacles to the peace process."  Citing an AFP 
story, Al-Ayyam reports that Abbas stated that, "We have great hopes 
that the [Moscow] conference will move the peace process between 
Palestinians and Israel forward and that it will lay the ground work 
for an overall peace process in all of the Middle East, including 
Syria and Lebanon." 
 
All front pages dedicate substantial coverage to "commemorative 
ceremonies on Prisoners Day" on April 17.  Al Quds documents the 
presidential celebration in Ramallah with a photo of Palestinian 
Premier Salam Fayyad attending the ceremony.  Palestinian President 
Abbas said in his remarks that, "there can be no peace agreement 
without freeing all prisoners."  Al-Quds reprints the entire 
transcript of Abbas remarks.  The dailies also report on several 
public protests and gatherings held throughout the West Bank.  Other 
inside pages of the dailies report that, "Palestinian children sent 
a letter to President Bush and to the world asking them to free 
their parents from Israeli jails."  A photo of an elderly mother 
weeping and carrying a picture of her jailed son appears on the 
front page of Al-Ayyam. 
 
The meeting between former President Carter and a Hamas delegation 
on April 17 in Cairo attracts front page coverage in all dailies. 
Al-Quds front page reports that Carter met with Egyptian President 
Mubarak on April 17 and will meet with Syrian President Al-Assad on 
April 18.  While in Syria, Carter will also meet with Hamas official 
Khalid Mash'al, the paper continues.  The front page of Al-Hayat 
Al-Jadida reports that, "the White House considers the meeting to be 
useless."  Al-Quds front page also runs a full translation of the 
Washington Post April 17 op-ed by former Hamas foreign minister 
al-Zahar. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida front pages a photo of Palestinian children 
standing with a sign that says, "Don't demolish the kindergarten."

The protest came as the Israeli high court considers a decision to 
demolish parts of the Al-Aqaba village near the northern West Bank 
town of Tubas. The Israeli military has urged that houses and a 
school be demolished because, "they are located in a military zone". 
 
 
Citing the wires, the front page of Al-Quds reports on the killing 
of 65 Iraqis and injuring of 60 others following an explosion in 
Karkuk on April 17.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------ 
 
¶1. Independent Al-Quds carries an op-ed by Dr. Naji Sharab, a 
political science teacher in Gaza, entitled, "What does the world 
expect from Palestinians? (04/18):"... the Palestinian question is 
the only one that enjoys the support of international declarations 
about its rights, including the right to self-determination.  Yet, 
the international community has worked to prevent Palestinians from 
obtaining their rights.  Moreover, the international community has 
called upon Palestinians to prove that they can practice democracy 
with a kind of transparency... that can rarely be found even in 
Western democracies.  [Despite this demand] Palestinians were 
punished for practicing democracy and choosing Hamas, which should 
be considered an internal matter [not open to foreign 
intervention]...  Democratic regimes, primarily the United States, 
have not given this show of democracy a chance because it was not to 
the benefit of Israel.  Therefore, a decision was made to derail it, 
first by the siege [economic blockade], then by [military] power and 
aggression, and by assassinations and the imprisonment of 
parliamentary members...[actions] which historically have not 
happened even in the most dictatorial of countries.  This is a real 
history lesson in how a strong democracy assassinates a weaker 
one." 
 
¶2. Independent Al-Ayyam carries an op-ed by regular columnist 
Muhammad Yaghi, entitled, "Invading Gaza" (04/18)": "... isn't 
destroying Hamas really just a call for other more extreme Islamic 
movements to come in and replace it?  Some people think that Israel 
is indifferent [to such a scenario] or that such a development would 
serve to better justify Israeli military attacks against 
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.  Israel might not care, if 
Gaza were not on its border, but [attracting more extremist 
elements] along the borders of Israel is the last thing that Israel 
needs.  The Israeli military may think that there is no difference 
between Hamas and more extreme Islamic organizations like Al-Qaeda. 
But in reality, Hamas has a political leadership that supervises its 
military structure and controls it.  In the case of Al-Qaeda, it is 
more of a militant group that acts alone, on the basis of continuous 
warfare... regardless of the costs or methods of fighting.  The 
issue of Gaza rocket attacks has no military solution.  It only has 
a political solution; a comprehensive truce in the West Bank and 
Gaza, the lifting of the siege and reopening of [Gaza] crossings, 
especially Rafah, the exchange of prisoners and acceleration of 
political negotiations to end the Israeli occupation of the West 
Bank."
