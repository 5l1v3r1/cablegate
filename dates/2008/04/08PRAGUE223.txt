(SBU) Czech MFA desk officer for Iraq, Sylva Sulaimanova, 
noted that the Czechs provided over two million crowns 
(roughly 200,000 USD) to the UN High Commission for Refugees 
last year.  Unfortunately, she indicated that it would be 
quite difficult for the Czechs to provide the same level of 
support this year, given their limited resources and their 
substantial additional commitments in Afghanistan (Note: In 
March 2008, the Czechs established a PRT in Lowgar province 
in Afghanistan.  The GOCR has substantially increased its 
funding for infrastructure development in Afghanistan and 
more than doubled its troops on the ground.  End Note.) 
While the Czechs share our concerns about the growing number 
of Iraqi refugees in Jordan and Syria as well as internally 
displaced persons, Sulaimanova noted that the Czechs have a 
small number (in the low hundreds) of refugees settled here 
in the Czech Republic and that any GOCR funds would be used 
to address the needs of these refugees first.
