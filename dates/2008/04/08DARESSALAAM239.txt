DELIVERED 
 
REF: STATE 38627 
 
¶1. (SBU) The Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs and 
International Cooperation, Ambassador Seif Ali-Idd, who led 
the Tanzanian delegation to the April 12 Southern African 
Development Community (SADC) meeting in Lusaka, Zambia, told 
PolCouns that Tanzania is committed to assuring that 
"Zimbabwe will not become another Kenya."  Ambassador Seif 
emphasized that Tanzania intended to strongly urge the SADC 
member states represented in Lusaka to push for the Zimbabwe 
Electoral Commission to release the results of the March 29 
Zimbabwean Presidential election as quickly as possible. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) After Ambassador Green tried, yet was unable to 
reach, either President Kikwete or Foreign Minister Bernard 
Membe (who are both traveling outside the country) to deliver 
reftel demarche, PolCouns, with the assistance of the 
Tanzanian High Commission in Lusaka, could finally reach 
Ambassador Seif the morning of April 12, just shortly before 
the SADC meeting began.  Ambassador Seif said Tanzania shares 
the concerns of the United States about the escalating 
violence in Harare.  He emphasized that Government of 
Tanzania (GOT) does not want the situation in Zimbabwe to 
escalate to the level of violence that occurred in Kenya 
following the December 2007 elections, and is certain many 
SADC members share the same goal.  He also stressed that 
Tanzania believes that the election results should be 
released immediately and will press for this objective in the 
SADC meeting.
