¶1.  The Government of Nepal (GON) is unlikely to send any 
delegates to the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear 
Terrorism Exercise Planning Group (EPG) to be held in Paris, 
France on April 15.  The Deputy Chief of Mission extended 
invitation as requested in Ref B to Foreign Secretary Acharya 
on April 3.  On April 8, Emboff followed up with the duty 
officer at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) as per Ref 
¶A.  (Note:  GON offices, including the MFA, are closed April 
7-14 in observance of the Constituent Assembly election on 
April 10 and subsequent local holidays.  End note.)  The duty 
officer said he would contact the Foreign Secretary and 
inform post if the GON decided to participate in the EPG. 
 
¶2.  The GON has been unable to participate in any Global 
Initiative-related exercise to date because of a limited 
budget and lack of officials with relevant technical 
expertise (Ref D).  The GON has yet to form an interagency 
group to handle Global Initiative issues (Ref C).  Post does 
not anticipate movement on any major programs, including the 
Global Initiative, until well after the new Constituent 
Assembly sits, probably in May.
