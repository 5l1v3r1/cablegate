SUBJECT: SETTLERS CONFIRM PLAN TO BUILD NEW UNITS IN ELKANA 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Responding to press reports of new construction 
planned in Elkana and Ariel, YESHA contacts said the Israeli 
Ministry of Defense (MoD) approved tenders on April 17 for 52 
units in Elkana and 48 in Ariel.  These contacts said the 
Elkana development involves converting 52 "cubiot" caravans 
to permanent housing, and allows detailed planning for 
utilities to proceed.  They said Elkana's proximity to Tel 
Aviv (about a 20-minute commute) will cause the new units to 
"sell like hotcakes," noting that all 80 units recently 
constructed in nearby Oranit settlement sold "overnight." 
 
¶2.  (SBU) YESHA contacts said the Elkana development was 
initially planned 3 or 4 years ago, and is one of several 
constructions plans awaiting approval.  Local press quoted 
Elkana Local Council head Yehuda Cohen noting that Elkana has 
a separate plan for 100 units awaiting MoD review.
