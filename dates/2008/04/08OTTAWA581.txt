(sbu) Minister of International Development Bev Oda will lead 
Canada's delegation to the May 2 Ad Hoc Liaison Committee 
(AHLC) meeting in London, according to Louise Corbin, 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) 
Acting Deputy Director for Israel/West Bank/Gaza.  (DFAIT's 
Middle East Director Michael Grant will accompany Minister 
Oda.)  Corbin said Canada has yet to disburse funds pledged 
at the December Donor's Conference because the Canadian 
fiscal year only started on April 1 -- but would do so in the 
coming months.  Corbin also stated that Canada would be 
represented at the May 21-23 PA Investment Conference by the 
Canadian Representative to the Palestinian Authority, who is 
based in Ramallah.
