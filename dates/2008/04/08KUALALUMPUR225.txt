¶1. (SBU) Preparations for a policymakers conference involving 
officials from Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia are 
moving forward.  PACOM and S/CT have committed funding for 
the event, scheduled to take place May 4-7, 2008 at the 
Shangri-La hotel in Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia.  The maritime 
policy division of Malaysia's National Security Council has 
agreed to the U.S.-facilitated event.  The tightly focused 
conference involving a small number of participants is 
intended to promote cross-border cooperation and coordination 
between relevant agencies from Indonesia, the Philippines, 
and Malaysia in their tri-border operating area.  The T3PC 
concept includes the involvement of a limited number of 
embassy officers with PACOM personnel to facilitate 
discussion among the conference delegates. 
 
Why Another Tri-border Conference? 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Combating transnational crime, including terrorism, 
and enhancing regional stability in the tri-border region 
require greater awareness, capability and coordination among 
the three nations.  Three rounds of U.S.-facilitated 
conferences for security officials from Indonesia, Malaysia 
and the Philippines have forged better communications and 
understanding in the tri-border area, and improved prospects 
for increased trilateral cooperation over the longer term to 
address common threats.  While earlier conferences have been 
productive, their effectiveness has been diminished at times 
by mismatches among the delegations in terms of their rank, 
interagency breadth, and depth of knowledge of tri-border 
security policies.  In addition, in the larger conference 
setting, the opportunities for exchanges between policymakers 
from the three countries have been limited.  To address these 
areas, the May Tri-border Policymakers Conference is designed 
as a smaller event with opportunities for extensive 
interchange between more senior officials who have 
responsibilities for aspects of maritime and border security. 
 This event provides an opportunity to enhance relationships 
among officials of the three countries, identify new 
opportunities for collaboration, elicit political support for 
programs currently in train or being planned for the 
tri-border area, and expose a core group of policymakers to 
other possibilities for advancing maritime security. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The draft agenda includes plenary sessions and 
breakout groups focused on domain awareness, threats and 
trends, security organization development, capacity building, 
security policy and practice (refs A and B).  The full agenda 
will be shared separately. 
 
Action Requested 
---------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) We invite Embassies Jakarta, Manila and Kuala Lumpur 
to designate two or three working-level experts on security 
forces, ports/borders, and regional security policy.  The 
teams would meet with PACOM counterparts prior to the 
conference, facilitate policymakers' discussion during 
break-out sessions, and remain afterward to consolidate 
outcomes and coordinate reporting and take-aways.  PACOM 
funds will pay for the embassy teams' travel, per diem, and 
lodging. 
 
¶5. (SBU) We also invite embassies to recommend delegations 
comprised of 5-6 policymakers at the agency Deputy Director 
or Under Secretary level representing the 5-6 host government 
agencies most deeply involved in issues impacting tri-border 
security.  By way of comparison, the Malaysian delegation 
will likely include representation from the NSC, Joint Forces 
HQ, Coast Guard, Marine Police, Customs, and MFA S.E. Asia 
Division.  Once delegates are recommended, embassies will 
have the opportunity to quickly assure that there is 
sufficient parity among the three delegations, and if 
necessary, make adjustments.  When final lists are agreed, 
embassies may begin human rights vetting of host nation 
officials.  Embassies would be asked to extend invitations to 
the foreign delegates drawing on stock language that will be 
provided separately.  Ideally, posts would contact foreign 
 
KUALA LUMP 00000225  002 OF 002 
 
 
officials and extend invitations one month before the event. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Please send the names, titles, and organizational 
affiliations of recommended delegates and embassy teams by to 
Jason Donovan (DonovanJ@state.gov).
