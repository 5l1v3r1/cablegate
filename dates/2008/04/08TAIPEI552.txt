¶2. (SBU) New Presidential Office Appointments: 
 
-- Secretary General Chan Chun-po will head the presidential 
office after serving as Ma's presidential campaign director 
and chief of Ma's presidential transition team.  Chan also 
directed Ma's successful 1998 and 2002 Taipei mayoral 
campaigns.  Chan will likely remain a Vice Chairman on the 
KMT Central Standing Committee, a position which he has held 
since January 2007.  Chan, 67 years old, was born in Changhua 
County.  He received his master's degree in political science 
from Harvard in 1970, and was an IV grantee in 1987.  Chan is

City Director of Public Health under Ma (1998-2000) and, 
after outstanding service during the SARS outbreak of 2003, 
returned to serve as Ma's deputy mayor (2004-2006).  Yeh quit 
the deputy mayorship in an unsuccessful attempt to seek the 
KMT nomination in the 2006 Taipei mayoral race.  He told the 
press on Saturday that he had declined Ma's original offer to 
head the Department of Health because he did not enjoy being 
in the limelight.  Yeh, 58, is a high school classmate of 
Ma's.  He has an M.D. from National Taiwan University and 
studied for his doctorate in public health at Harvard.  He 
speaks English at the S-3 level. 
 
-- On April 14, Ma confirmed that he will appoint KMT Vice 
Chairman P.K. Chiang (Pin-kung) Chairman of the Straits 
Exchange Foundation (SEF).  Ma indicated that Chiang's 
extensive contacts with Chinese officials and Taiwan 
businesspeople in China made him the ideal candidate for the 
post.  Chiang served two terms as legislator (2001-2008), was 
Chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development 
(1995-2000), and Economics Minister (1993-1995).  Chiang,
