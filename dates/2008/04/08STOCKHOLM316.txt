SUBJECT: STATE SECRETARY BELFRAGE SAYS HE WAS MISQUOTED BY 
IRANIAN PRESS 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) State-run Iranian press source, Press TV, ran a web 
article on April 23, which misquoted Swedish State Secretary 
Frank Belfrage during his recent visit to Tehran.  In a 
meeting on April 25 in Stockholm, the DCM showed Belfrage the 
article. 
 
Excerpted text: 
 
"Belfrage has praised Iran's commitment to restore Iraq's 
stability and security... (and) described Tehran as the 
cornerstone of Iraq's progress." 
 
End excerpted text. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Belfrage, not having heard about the article, told 
the DCM that he told Iranian FM Mottaki that "it was 
important that Iran contribute to the stability of Iraq." 
Furthermore, he said he did not made this comment to the 
Iranian press, but rather to Mottaki.  Apparently Mottaki, or 
an aide, misquoted him to the press.  We said we appreciated 
the clarification.
