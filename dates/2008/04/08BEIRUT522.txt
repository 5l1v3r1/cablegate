SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
¶1.  (U) In FY 2006, the State Department's Office of the 
Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS) 
received $10 million under Section 1207 of the 2006 National 
Defense Authorization Act in response to an emergency request 
for assistance to Lebanon following the July 2006 war between 
Israel and Lebanese-based Hizballah.  A USG interagency 
group, including representatives from DOD and State, 
implemented a number of humanitarian and stabilization 
programs.  $5 million worth was dedicated to demining 
activities and the remaining $5 million was used to support 
GOL security forces. Activities funded through 1207 have had 
a positive impact on thousands of Lebanese citizens and has 
helped stabilize the country in the aftermath of the war. 
End Summary. 
 
SUCCESS STORIES 
--------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) From September 2006 to December 2006, a total of 
2,170,915 m2 of Lebanese territory was cleared of mines and 
11,642 pieces of unexploded ordnance (UXO) were removed and 
destroyed by the Mine Advisory Group (MAG).  The 1207 funds 
also allowed for the recruitment, equipping, and training of 
Battle Area Clearance teams (BAC).  Section 1207 funds also 
equipped the operational Mine Action Center (MAC) in south 
Lebanon to deal with unexploded ordnance (UXO) and 
sub-munitions clearance operations.  Since August 2006, 
nearly 17,000 remnants of war, including cluster 
sub-munitions, booby traps and other unexploded ordnance UXO 
have been destroyed and over 6.8 million m2 of land have been 
cleared in south Lebanon.  Nearly 450,000 residents now live 
safe and secure lives free from land-mines as a result of 
this funding. 
 
¶3.  (U) In addition to demining activities, $5 million of the 
FY 06 1207 funding went to activities supporting the Lebanese 
Internal Security Forces (ISF) and General Security (GS), 
both government law enforcement agencies.  With FY 2006 1207 
funding, 2000 sets of Civil Disorder Management (CDM) 
equipment was delivered to the ISF's Mobile Forces, which 
helped them to contain subsequent pro-Hizballah street 
protests in Beirut.  A USG funded program trained the ISF to 
use this gear to preserve order during a chaotic political 
time in Lebanon.  The ISF action meant that street protests 
were unsuccessful in bringing down the democratically elected 
government, the protesters aim. 
 
¶4.  (U) FY 06 1207 funding also helped equip GS with 20 
computers programmed with i2 investigative analysis software. 
 Funds will also help train GS officers to operate these 
programs.  This donation was the first USG foreign assistance 
granted to the GS and supported the mission's goals of 
strengthening Lebanon's control over its borders by assisting 
the GS, which has the sole responsibility over immigration at 
the Beirut International Airport (BIA), four land border 
crossings, and several maritime ports. 
 
INTERAGENCY COORDINATION 
------------------------ 
 
¶5.  (U) After the July 2006 war between Israel and Hizballah, 
Embassy Beirut established a Reconstruction and Stabilization 
(R&S) Office consisting of two FSOs and two LES specialists. 
The purpose of this office, which reports directly to the 
Front Office is to track all USG foreign assistance in 
Lebanon to ensure coordination and maximum utility.  The R&S 
office chairs weekly meetings of representatives from DOD, 
State (MEPI, INL, PD, and RSO), and USAID.  Officials from 
the three agencies discuss the implementation and evaluation 
of all USG funded programs, including FY 06 1207 projects. 
 
¶6.  (U) At these meetings State and DOD officials often 
discuss and coordinate on security assistance programs and 
 
BEIRUT 00000522  002 OF 002 
 
 
share information and best practices.  For example, State 
officers worked with DOD colleagues to determine the best 
type of CDM equipment to purchase or hold discussions on best 
practices for end-use onitoring procedures between State and 
DOD representatives for the 20 donated Dell desktops.  Thiscooperation has empowered the relatively small embassy staff 
managing 1207 to build on the strengths and expertise of 
fellow Country Team members.
