¶1.  (SBU) In an April 3 meeting with Poleconoffs, Sam Rainsy 
Party (SRP) parliamentarian Tioulong Samura evinced 
confidence in the face of rumors that she could be arrested 
over allegations that she was involved in the detention of a 
defector from the Sam Rainsy Party (reftel).  Samura, who had 
just returned to Cambodia from overseas, said that she was 
aware of arrest rumors--including some gossip that her 
parliamentary immunity could be lifted.  There were always 
rumors, she said, and it was impossible to know what rumors 
to take seriously.  She declared herself ready to serve time 
in jail, with her suitcase already packed with several 
lengthy books and yarn to knit clothes for her new 
grandchild.  She also stated that she would be willing to 
answer questions from the police if asked. 
 
¶2.  (C) The opposition leader, who is also the wife of party 
chief Sam Rainsy, said that she wasn't surprised by the 
allegations, describing them as "one of a series of tricks 
they (the CPP) has used against us."  She also relayed 
accusations about Cambodian People's Party (CPP) infiltration 
of the SRP:  that some SRP defectors had been assigned to 
publicly defect while others were told to remain within the 
party as spies. (Comment:  This information is third 
hand--coming from alleged detention victim Tim Norn, who has 
proven to be an unreliable source prone to change stories, 
and delivered via Samura.  End Comment.)  Samura said she 
expected another wave of detentions in late April when the 
SRP submits its party list.
