SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  In March 2008, the Government of Nicaragua (GON) resolved 5 
claims, and 2 U.S. citizens withdrew a total of 4 claims from the 
Embassy Property Office database.  With the inclusion of 5 claims 
resolved in March, the GON has resolved 12 claims during the 
2007-2008 waiver year.  The Property Office database now includes 
657 registered property claims belonging to 309 Amcits.  Most 
resolutions have involved compensation via government-issued 
indemnification bonds ("bonos de pago de indemnizacion" or BPIs). 
As of March 31, 2008, the GON has issued BPIs with a face value of 
$324,059,784 to Embassy-registered claimants during this waiver 
year.  Since taking office in January 2007, the Ortega 
administration has resolved a total of 17 claims. 
 
EMBASSY-REGISTERED CLAIMS RESOLVED IN MARCH 2008 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶2.  On March 6, 2008, Dr. Elizabeth Karim, legal representative for 
U.S. citizen Octavio Bustamante, provided a copy of the final 
settlement document (finiquito) to the Embassy Property Office 
attesting that on August 24, 2007, the GON compensated Bustamante 
with BPIs for three fishing vessels.  Mr. Bustamante settled with 
the GON for BPIs with a face value of 330,200 cordobas, 
approximately $17,257.50.  We have updated our database to reflect 
this settlement.

¶3.  On March 4, 2008, Dr. Ricardo Larga Espada, legal representative 
for U.S. citizen Perla Ordonez, informed the Property Office that 
she has control of 2 Embassy-registered claims and he requested that 
we remove the cases from our database.

EMBASSY REGISTERED CLAIMS WITHDRAWN BY U.S. CITIZEN 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶4. On March 4, Dr. Ricardo Larga Espada, legal representative for 
U.S. citizen Perla Ordonez, requested that the Property Office 
remove 1 Embassy-registered claims from our database because this 
case is a private dispute with her neighbor. 
 
¶5. On March 6, 2008, Dr. Elizabeth Karim, the legal representative 
for U.S. citizen Octavio Bustamante, requested that the Property 
Office remove 3 Embassy-registered claims from our database because 
the properties were foreclosed by a bank on November 28, 1996, so 
there is no longer any claim pending against the GON for these 
properties. 
 
                       Type of            No. of
