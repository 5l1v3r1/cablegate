SUBJECT: PRT LASHKAR GAH, HELMAND PROVINCE: MUSA QALA RECONSTRUCTION 
AND POLITICAL UPDATE 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  Musa Qala remains stable but the absence of 
Mullah Salam and the District Shura has slowed government 
reconstruction efforts and stalled governance development. 
Ministries' provincial representatives in Lashkar Gah cannot 
coordinate development activities and will not send staff to Musa 
Qala until the local government returns.  The USAID generator was 
installed on March 27, and a local staff has been trained to operate 
and maintain the equipment.  The Afghan National Police (ANP) 
maintain order in the city and continue to work well with the UK 
Police Mentoring Teams (PMT).  However, freedom of movement outside 
the city is limited and security remains the greatest concern of 
city residents. 
 
Musa Qala Politics 
------------------ 
¶2.  (SBU) Mullah Salam and the Musa Qala District Shura left the 
city three weeks ago for Kabul, and only returned to Helmand on 
April 3.  Local residents are upset that their local government 
spent so much time in the capital and not in Musa Qala working on 
local issues.  Additionally, the Musa Qala Shura has not resolved 
land use issues in the city and this is delaying construction of the 
police and government building.  Residents expressed support for 
ISAF and government operations but are anxious to see reconstruction 
and development efforts move forward and create additional jobs in 
the city. 
 
Development Update 
------------------ 
¶3.  (SBU) USAID installed and tested the generator on March 27, and 
USAID engineers have trained a local resident to operate and 
maintain the equipment.  USAID will pay the operator's salary and 
the PRT will fund the fuel costs for the immediate future.  USAID 
also trained UK personnel on the application process for Small 
Community Grants.  USAID expects to start disbursing Small Community 
Grants within next 30 days.  Furthermore, USAID continues to work 
with Provincial Agricultural Authorities on the roll-out of a 
500-participant contract farming program in Musa Qala, expected to 
begin in six weeks with the start of corn-planting season. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Raz Mohammad, Deputy Minister of Rural Rehabilitation and 
Development, told PRT officers that a contract to build a mosque 
with a capacity of 800 people for central Musa Qala is signed.  He 
said that his ministry has the required funding and that his local 
director and three engineers will soon arrive to mark the site and 
coordinate an official ground breaking event.  Mohammad said he will 
try to employ two staff to work with the area leaders and supervise 
the implementation of various projects.  USAID will support these 
staff by coordinating logistics. 
 
Security 
-------- 
¶5. (SBU) The Afghan Police forces continue to work well with the UK 
Police Mentors, and Police Commander Koka has improved policing in 
the city.  The police arrested two armed Taliban inside the District 
Center on March 27, and have prevented several attacks on the local 
political leadership.  Shopkeepers have complained, however, that 
Salam's militia/guards have tried to collect taxes, which they 
assert is clearly illegal.  Commercial supplies continue to reach 
the city, but freedom of movement outside the city is limited; 
residents said "real security" extends just 1-2 kms from the city. 
UK stabilization officers said they were unable to leave the secure 
area of the city on a regular basis, and PRT officers were unable to 
visit reconstruction projects, due to the increased risk of suicide 
bombers. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Over the past three months the PRT and local government 
have effectively coordinated reconstruction and development efforts. 
 Unfortunately, the prolonged absence of Salam and the Shura delayed 
project implementation and left a leadership void in the city. 
Helmand officials will not send staff to work in Musa Qala and 
residents have no effective government body.  The return of the 
local government to Musa Qala is critical to resolve development and 
security issues.
