SUBJECT: MOROCCO OPTIMISTIC ON PROSPECT OF SIGNING ON TO 
PSI 
 
REF: STATE 71525 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On April 3, 2008, Poloff extended ref invitation to 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs Director for United Nations 
Division Azzedine Farhane for the Government of Morocco (GOM) 
to attend the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) May 
28-29 event in Washington D.C.  Farhane said that he would 
pass the diplomatic note and background materials to his 
superiors and get back to us.  After Poloff fielded questions 
regarding the number of participants currently in PSI, 
particularly among other African countries, Farhane seemed 
pleased and said that he would personally recommend to his 
superiors that the GOM should join the PSI since its 
principles fall in line with other nonproliferation and 
security measures that Morocco currently practices. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On April 4, 2008, MFA Director General Youssef 
Amrani indicated to DCM that Morocco was positively disposed 
toward PSI.  Later that day, MFA Secretary General Omar 
Hilale briefly told PolCouns that he appreciated the 
nvitation to the meeting in Washington D.C. and that the GOM 
was very interested in PSI.  Hilale said that there were some 
unspecified bureaucratic obstacles to signing on but that MFA 
officials were trying to work them.
