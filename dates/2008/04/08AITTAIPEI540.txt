Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused news 
coverage April 18 on the alleged power struggle in President-elect 
Ma Ying-jeou's team; on the idea of relocating the Presidential 
Office; and on the row between the Chinese government and CNN.  In 
terms of editorials and commentaries, an editorial in the 
pro-independence "Liberty Times" tried to remind the Taiwan people 
of China's bullying by citing the example of China's suppression of 
freedom of the press and the Chinese government's recent move for 
inflaming patriotism in China.  End summary. 
 
"Does It Mean that the Taiwan People Have to Grin and Bear It?" 
 
The pro-independence "Liberty Times" [circulation: 720,000] 
editorialized (4/18): 
 
"In recent years, China always claims publicly that it wants a 
peaceful rise and the establishment of a harmonious world.  In other 
words, [China] seemingly is ready to accept the norm of civilization 
and enter the big family of international human rights.  But in fact 
we can always easily tell from China's behavior that the so-called 
peaceful rise is actually a malicious rise.  [China's] so-called a 
harmonious world is based on the prerequisite that the international 
community has to yield to China's standards. ... 
 
"China's official and people's national sentiments can ignite just 
by a slight inflammation, and Taiwan should take warning from this. 
At the moment, some people lay the future of Taiwan's economy on 
China, including the opening of direct flights across the Taiwan 
Strait, allowing Chinese capital to flow to Taiwan, opening up 
[Taiwan] to Chinese tourists, allowing conversion between the New 
Taiwan dollar and the Chinese yuan, and promoting a cross-Strait 
common market.  However, as described before, if [Taiwan] walks this 
road, once China's officials and people are discontented with 
Taiwan, they can oppress Taiwan into yielding to China's threats by 
using methods such as 'boycotting Taiwan products' or 'prohibiting 
travel to Taiwan.'  For example, in order to attract Chinese 
tourists, [Taiwan's] tourism industry will greatly increase the 
construction of tourism facilities for them.  Not only will tourists 
from developed countries such as Europe, the United States and Japan 
be crowded out, but our government will definitely also be forced to 
take China's blackmail when facing pressure from tourism industry 
people if China prohibits Chinese tourists from visiting Taiwan. 
Shouldn't those people who keep saying 'rely on China' day and night 
think about the possible consequences in the first place?"
