SUBJECT: PRT CHAGHCHARAN: No Improvements in sight to Runway at 
Chaghcharan Airport 
 
REF:  Vilnius 272 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: The Chaghcharan airport improvement project has 
had an off-again, on-again existence since the Asian Development 
Bank (ADB) first provided funding in 2004.  The project as 
originally conceived by the Afghan government would cost 
approximately USD 3 million to refurbish runways, aprons and taxi 
ways.  In mid-2007, the Lithuanian-led PRT voiced concerns about the 
improvements since they would make the runway unsuitable for C-130 
traffic, which it can currently receive.  The Combined Security 
Transition Command-Afghanistan (CSTC-A) initially expressed interest 
in bringing the airport up to the C-130 standard, but was unable to 
provide the funding.  The Ministry of Transportation and Civil 
Aviation (MoTCA) has used up all the ADB funding on cost over-runs 
at other airports.  The Afghan government has requested additional 
funding from the ADB, and Lithuania has tentatively allocated part 
of its budget for Afghanistan operations to improve the airport.  It 
is unlikely that the airstrip will be improved in the near to medium 
term. 
 
In The Beginning 
---------------- 
¶2. (SBU) In November 2004, the ADB provided approximately USD 20 
million to the Afghan government for the rehabilitation and widening 
of existing runways and construction of aprons and taxi ways at 
selected regional airports.  The plan was to spend approximately USD 
3 million each on seven regional airports.  During the first round 
of bidding, a Turkish company submitted a bid for USD 13 million for 
the Chaghcharan project.  The bidding was subsequently re-opened but 
no bidders were qualified. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In mid-2007, the Lithuanian-led PRT in Ghor province became 
concerned when they learned that the refurbished runway would only 
support aircraft up to an operational weight of 21 tons.  The 
operational weight of a C-130 is approximately 71 tons, and the PRT 
is heavily dependent on C-130 traffic for life support due to its 
remote location and lack of serviceable roads.  Currently, 
Chaghcharan receives four to six C-130s in a week.  If the airstrip 
were refurbished only to the level requested by the Afghan 
government, the planned thin-crust runway would not support C-130s. 
Without C-130 supply flights, the PRT would have to close. 
 
Search for Alternative Sources of Funding 
----------------------------------------- 
¶4. (SBU) In its 2007 budget for Afghanistan operations, Lithuania 
did not allocate funds to upgrade the airport.  They contacted 
different entities to try to identify alternative sources of 
funding.  CSTC-A expressed interest in funding the difference 
between the amount that ADB would provide and the amount needed to 
make the airport C-130 worthy, since the airport is strategically 
important due to its location in the approximate geo-center of 
Afghanistan.  (Ghor's small population and limited agricultural and 
craft production are insufficient to make a strong economic argument 
for the airport.)  CSTC-A engineers estimated that it would cost 
approximately USD 28 million to make the Chaghcharan airport C-130 
capable. 
 
Lithuania Makes the Rounds 
--------------------------- 
¶5. (SBU) Lithuanian representatives raised their concerns with the 
governor of Ghor Province, CSTC-A, ISAF HQ, the ADB and the MoTCA. 
After several on-again, off-again rounds between the ADB and the 
MoTCA, the project stalled because it was dependent on having funds 
left over after other, higher-priority airports were refurbished 
(such as Badghis, Faryab and Badakhshan).  Unfortunately, cost 
over-runs have used up all the ADB funding.  CENTCOM has directed 
CSTC-A to focus on airports in southern Afghanistan and to be more 
"careful" about spending U.S. funds, and therefore CSTC-A has 
withdrawn its potential support for the Chaghcharan airport. 
 
Effort Continues 
---------------- 
¶6. (SBU) In March 2008, the MoTCA told the Lithuanians and ISAF that 
it would ask the ADB for additional funding for the Chaghcharan 
airport.  The MoTCA said that if the ADB turned down its request, 
MoTCA would go to the Ministry of Finance to identify other funding. 
 Lithuania has tentatively decided to allocate part of its budget 
for Afghanistan to improve the airport.
