REF: JAKARTA 452 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary.  The Olympic torch passed through Jakarta 
April 22, guarded by 3,000 police, observed by 1,000 
spectators and protested by 200 human rights activists.  One 
Dutch human rights activist was arrested along with nine 
hired thugs.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) In a closed ceremony held at the Bung Karno sports 
stadium on April 22, a thousand spectators observed the 
Olympic torch in a ceremony in which 80 dignitaries and 
celebrities took turns carrying the torch around the stadium. 
 Outside the stadium, 200 pro-Tibet demonstrators from a 
coalition of human rights organizations displayed free Tibet 
banners, according to Embassy FSNs. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) A Dutch student, Stefe Boulte, working as an intern 
for the Indonesian human rights group Kontras, was arrested 
under a law prohibiting foreigners from participating in 
demonstrations, a Kontras representative told DepPol/C. 
Kontras contacted the Netherlands Embassy regarding the 
arrest   A group of thugs, apparently hired by one of the 
torch event's Indonesian sponsors to supplement security, 
instigated a scuffle by wresting away a banner from 
protesters.  Nine of the thugs were arrested and released, an 
FSN reported. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Otherwise the demonstration, organized by a 
respected human rights leader, Tri Agus, was peaceful. 
Protesters called for Indonesia to review its bilateral 
relationship with China and to investigate the human rights 
situation.  The same coalition which organized this protest 
also has been active on criticizing the regime in Burma and 
helped organize a March conference on Burma (see reftel).
