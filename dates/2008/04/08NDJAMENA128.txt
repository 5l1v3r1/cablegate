SUBJECT: CHAD: PRIME MINISTER ANNOUNCED REBEL 
INCURSION 
 
¶1.  (U) On April 1, Chadian Prime Minister Kassire 
convoked the diplomatic corps at his office to 
announce that at 6:40 a.m. Chad time a group of armed 
rebels had attacked Ade, 68 kilometers from the 
Chad/Sudan border.  Prime Minister Kassire stated that 
this attack was proof that Sudanese President Bechir 
"had not changed."  Despite the Dakar accord he 
continued to be the aggressor.  His aim was nothing 
less than the annihilation of Chad.  Prime Minister 
Kassire asked for a "mobilization of conscience" among 
the international community. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Post was informed by UN security services 
(UNDSS) earlier today of heavy fighting near Ade. 
Although the World Food Program (WFP) security officer 
reported that Abeche was calm, it appears that a large 
number of Chadian National Army (ANT) troops departed 
Abeche for Goz Beida late on March 31. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Other government sources have confirmed this 
attack and believe that the rebel forces intend to 
continue South West towards Am Timan (Salamat region). 
Some Chadian sources believe that the rebels may hold 
in Am Timan in order to resupply and await further 
instructions before attacking N'Djamena. 
 
¶4. (U) Post held an EAC (septel) to discuss the 
security situation and review tripwires. 
 
¶5. (U) Tripoli minimize considered.
