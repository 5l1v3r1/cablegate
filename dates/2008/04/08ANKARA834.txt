¶1. This report was coordinated with FAS Ankara. 
 
¶2. SUMMARY: Turkey has the highest per capita wheat consumption in 
the world, and in a normal year is not only self-sufficient but 
exports wheat flour to neighboring countries.  Severe drought in 
2007 slashed Turkish crop yields, and commodity prices in Turkey 
began to rise by mid-summer 2007.  Price increases have continued, 
attracting more attention when international media began to cover 
global food price concerns.  The government first moved to control 
prices in the fall of 2007 by increasing grain import quotas and 
cutting duties on grain and oilseeds, although with limited success. 
 Commodity analysts and many consumers are convinced that official 
statistics understate both production shortfalls and price 
increases.  END SUMMARY 
 
DEMAND 
------ 
 
¶3. Turkey has the highest per capita wheat consumption in the world, 
and in a normal year is not only self-sufficient but exports wheat 
flour to neighboring countries.  Rising incomes are slowly 
increasing demand for livestock products, and the government is 
trying to increase the efficiency of the sector, especially dairy. 
One benefit of this has been the re-opening of the market for 
imports of U.S. breeding cattle, after which Turkey immediately 
became the largest market for U.S. breeding cattle outside of North 
America. 
 
SUPPLY 
------ 
 
¶4.  The worst drought in decades severely damaged the 2007 grain and 
oilseed crops across most of Anatolia, and also sharply reduced 
output of horticultural products.  Post forecasts that stocks of 
grain and oilseeds at the end of the 2007/08 crop year will be as 
much as 75 percent below normal. 
 
¶5.  Both food and feed grain prices began to rise in mid-summer 2007 
as the extent of the drought became clear.  At first the GOT tried 
to control bread price increases in major cities, but flour, pasta 
and bulgur prices continued to rise.  By February 2008, the price of 
milling wheat at the Polatli Commodity Exchange was 25 percent 
higher than a year earlier.  As the price of bulgur and pasta 
increased, consumers began to switch to rice, which had not been 
affected by drought.  Because of this increase in demand, the price 
of rice quickly increased as much as other products.  Although per 
capita consumption of wheat is about 25 times higher than that of 
rice, rice price increases have received more attention in the 
media, perhaps because of stories in the international press.  The 
drought also reduced domestic sunflower seed production and doubled 
local prices for vegetable oil. 
 
GOVERNMENT POLICY RESPONSE 
-------------------------- 
 
¶6.  The GOT was aware of the impact of the drought as soon as the 
wheat harvest began in June 2007.  Grain imports are government 
controlled through the Turkish State Grain Board (TMO).  In July 
2007, TMO officials approached post's FAS office inquiring if USDA 
credit guarantees would be available for up to 2 million metric tons 
of wheat imports, their estimate of the production shortfall.  A 
week later, the Minister of Agriculture was quoted as saying the 
production shortfall was only 500,000 tons.  Unfortunately for TMO, 
it took until October for Parliament to grant authority to import 
wheat, and by then world prices had doubled from their July levels. 
Furthermore, the initial wheat import quota was only 800,000 tons, 
which flour millers recognized as inadequate.  TMO also was 
authorized to import 300,000 tons of corn for feed.  Additional 
authorizations have continued.  The most recent announcement on 
April 8 gave TMO permission to import up to 700,000 MT of wheat with 
zero duty until May 31, 2009. 
 
¶7.  In September 2007, because of reduced sunflower seed production, 
GOT reduced import duties for most vegetable oils.  In October, the 
GOT allowed duty free imports of sunflower seed for crushing. 
Although the 2007 rice harvest was normal, and ironically the GOT 
was defending its protectionist rice import policies in the WTO, in 
April 2008, TMO was given a duty free import quota for 100,000 MT of 
rice for use until May 31, 2009. 
 
POLITICAL IMPACT 
 
ANKARA 00000834  002 OF 002 
 
 
---------------- 
 
¶8.  In recent weeks, opposition parties in Parliament have demanded 
formation of a committee to investigate why wheat, rice and other 
grain prices have risen so sharply in Turkey.  Shortcomings in 
domestic agricultural policies have been the focus of the 
complaints, rather than drought or the international situation.  The 
ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) Government has 
acknowledged the effects of rising food and energy prices on the 
economy.  While official statistics state that food prices rose 
16.28 percent from March 2007 to March 2008, commodity analysts and 
many consumers are convinced that official statistics understate 
both production shortfalls and price increase. 
 
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT 
-------------------- 
 
¶9.  While rising food prices have not yet had an effect on 
environmental issues such as deforestation, water availability and 
quality, and soil conservation, 2007's drought has had a significant 
impact on water availability and quality and required increased 
irrigation that was reported in refs B - D.  This, in turn, 
contributed to the rise in food prices in Turkey.  So far this crop 
year, rainfall in Central Anatolia's wheat belt has been close to 
normal, but the size of the crop will depend on the May rains.  In 
contrast, Southeastern Anatolia, which suffered less damage last 
year, is suffering a severe drought: rainfall since last autumn is 
only half of normal.  Although the Southeast is not as important a 
wheat production area as Central Anatolia, it is an important 
producer of pulses, such as lentils, that are a staple food. 
 
ECONOMIC IMPACT 
--------------- 
 
¶10.  On April 29, Turkey's Treasury Minister, Mehmet Simsek, stated 
that the GOT expects its current account deficit to reach $50 
billion in 2008 due in part to the global rise in commodity prices, 
including food prices.  Simsek also forecasted continued high-level 
inflation because of the same conditions, and the Turkish Central 
Bank revised its expected inflation rate for food prices to 13% by 
the end of 2008.  Turkey is import dependent for industrial 
production and final consumption.  Turkish Foreign Trade 
Undersecretariat data shows that unprocessed and processed food 
imports for industrial usage increased 156% for the first two months 
of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007.  Imports of these 
products for final consumption increased by 79% for the same period. 
 U.S. exports have benefitted from Turkey's increased import demand. 
 Exports of U.S. grains, feedstuffs, and vegetable oil in 2007 were 
valued at $265 million, three times the 2006 level.  Current 
statistics are not available to indicate how many poor households 
would be impoverished by food price rises.  2006 statistics 
calculated the poverty rate at 17.8% and indicated that 539,000 of 
Turkey's 70.6 million people lived at the subsistence level when 
looking at their food expenditures.
