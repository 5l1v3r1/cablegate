REF: JERUSALEM 565 
 
¶1.  (SBU) According to PA Civil Affairs director Hussayn 
al-Shaykh and Joint Security Committee (JSC) head Samir 
Makhzumi Qaysi, IDF Central Command liaison officers gave 
them a map late April 2 of 48 roadblocks that the IDF said it 
had recently removed.  (Note: the PA JSC chief leads the PA's 
District Coordination Offices (DCOs), which are responsible 
for liaison with the IDF but have been largely inactive since 
the second Intifadah.  End note).  Al-Shaykh and Makhzumi 
said the IDF called them early April 3 to request that the 
maps be returned, as they are incomplete, contain mistakes, 
and would be replaced with a more updated version.  Al-Shaykh 
and Makhzumi said they returned the maps as requested. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Makhzumi and al-Shaykh said the IDF assured them 
they will receive a new, more accurate map the afternoon of 
April 3.  Both said they would provide the USG with a copy 
(please protect) as soon as they receive it.
