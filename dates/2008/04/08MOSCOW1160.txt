¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a Pre-license check to determine 
the legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, 
Comimpex, Moscow, Russia. The company is listed on BIS 
license application D393772 as the ultimate consignee 
of air cartridges, taser kits and tasercam, extended 
range electronic projectile, quantity:200. These items 
are controlled for crime control reasons under ECCN 
OA985. The licensee is Taser International, Inc., 
17800 N. 85th St., Scottsdale, AZ 85255. 
 
¶3. On April 18, 2008, Export Control Attache Peter 
Liston and LES Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested pre-license check at the offices of 
Comimpex, Ryabinovaya st., 47, Moscow, Russia. The 
export control team met with Vladimir Abramov, General 
Director of Inforcom and Comimpex Companies. 
 
 
 
¶4.  Vladimir Abramov, DBA Inforcom and Comimpex, owns 
and operates a well established electronics and IP 
import and retails sales business in Russia.  Inforcom 
was established in 1988 and is the 2nd largest retail 
distributor of U.S. manufactured PolkAudio speakers in 
the world.  Vladimir Abramov travels regularly to the 
United States on both business (related to PlokAudio) 
and pleasure.  Abramov has attended numerous trade 
shows in the United States.  It was a trade show in 
Las Vegas approximately 6 years ago where Abramov was 
introduced to Taser International and their line of 
products.  When Taser recently released a consumer 
line of products for the commercial market, that 
included a women's line, he decided that it was the 
right time to enter into market.  Abramov met with 
Taser International in the United States and received 
exclusive rights to sell the product in Russia. 
Abramov established the company Comimpex approximately 
3 months ago solely for the importation and marketing 
of the Taser product. 
 
¶5.  Vladimir Abramov employs approximately 17 people 
at this time.  Abramov is expanding his operations and 
relocating to a larger office/warehouse complex that 
is under construction.  The Moscow Export Control Team 
was given a tour of the new office location, which 
will house only Abramov's businesses and will include 
the latest security system available on the market. 
Abramov is familiar with the licensing restrictions 
with the commodity in reftel and has the technical and 
commercial sophistication to market it under the terms 
of his exclusive contract with Taser and Commerce 
License. 
 
¶6. Recommendations: Post recommends Comimpex, Moscow, 
Russia, as reliable recipients of sensitive U.S. 
origin commodities. It is requested that post be 
notified of final disposition of the application, and 
of any shipments for this organization in order to 
conduct appropriate FCS follow-up and statistical 
reporting.
