SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERED:  COSTA RICA REMAINS ON 301 
WATCH LIST 
 
REF: STATE 43145 
 
¶1.  AUSTR Everett Eissenstat, accompanied by Charge Peter 
Brennan, FCO, and EconOff, delivered Reftel demarche to the 
GOCR's Minister of Foreign Trade (COMEX), Marco Vinicio Ruiz, 
on April 24, 2008. 
 
¶2.  Minister Ruiz and attending COMEX officials were not 
surprised by the news (that Costa Rica remains on the Watch 
List). 
One COMEX official acknowledged the status as fair as Costa 
Rica made 
virtually no progress in IP legislation or enforcement 
over the past year. 
 
¶3. COMMENT: Costa Rica's planned implementation of CAFTA by 
October 1 should significantly advance IPR legislation and 
protection. 
Enforcement will remain the GOCR's distinct challenge for the 
next cycle of Special 301 reporting, however.  The one glimmer of 
good news: 
During her meeting with AUSTR Eissenstat on April 24, VP and 
Justice Minister Laura Chinchilla acknowledged the need for increased IP enforcement and said the GOCR was seriously considering creating a dedicated prosecutor unit for that purpose.
