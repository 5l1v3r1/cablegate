¶1. (U) EU contacts confirmed that the EU will be represented 
at the Expanded Neighbors process on April 22 in Kuwait by 
Slovenian Presidency Foreign Minister Rupel, Council desk 
officer for Iraq Sophie Kisling, and Commission Deputy 
Director-General for the Middle East Hugues Mingarelli. 
Council HiRep Javier Solana and Commissioner for External 
Affairs Benita Ferrero Waldner will both be in Japan for the 
EU-Japan summit meeting on 22 April and thus are unable to 
attend the Expanded Neighbors meeting. Council contact 
understands both French FM Kouchner and British FM Miliband 
will also attend the neighbors meeting.  EU participation in 
the May 29 Stockholm ministerial meeting of the International 
Compact with Iraq has not yet been determined. Council 
contact assured us that encouraging debt relief, diplomatic 
representation, general establishment of friendly relations, 
and (where appropriate) non-interference are routinely 
included in their talking points with Arab governments. 
 
¶2. (SBU) PM Maliki will visit Brussels on 16 and 17 April and 
will meet with EU officials on the 16th as follows: 
President of the European Parliament Han-Gert Poettering, 
President of the European Commission Jose Manuel Barroso and 
Secretary General/High Representative of the Council Javier
