     ¶B. GAREY-KANEDA E-MAIL (4/23) 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  In response to ref A demarche, MFA acting Somalia 
desk officer Frederic Bouvier said on April 23 that the 
French had been in discussion with the Norwegian organizers 
of the April 30 Somalia International Contact Group meeting. 
Bouvier said that France would attend, but only as part of 
the EU delegation.  Bouvier said that Somalia desk officer 
Thierry Caboche would be the French representative.  Bouvier 
remarked that attendance as part of the EU delegation was not 
a problem in terms of France's not being an "official" 
individual member of the ICG.  The recent piracy incident in 
Somalia had raised French interest in issues involving 
Somalia, he commented.  This was reflected in France's work 
on regional piracy issues at the UN and in its interest in 
the April 30 Oslo meeting.  He said that the MFA would inform 
us if it had any comments on ref A points. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  In a brief April 24 follow-up exchange, Bouvier 
said that the French were "perfectly comfortable" with the 
approach set forth in ref A points.
