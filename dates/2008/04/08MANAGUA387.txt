¶1. (SBU) Summary: Post requests that nonimmigrant visa eligibility 
be restored for Alejandro Bosco Arguello Guzman.  Post has confirmed 
that Arguello resolved his property claim dispute with the heir of 
U.S. claimant Mrs. Teodolinda Gonzalez-Becklin on January 15, 2008. 
Based on this resolution, Post requests that the Department 
determine whether Section 2225 of the 1998 Foreign Affairs Reform 
and Restructuring Act still applies to Mr. Arguello Guzman.  Please 
see action request in Paragraph 4.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On October 15, 2007, Mrs. Jeanette Raider, daughter and 
heir of U.S. claimant Mrs. Teodlinda Gonzalez-Becklin, told the 
Office of Assessment and Indemnification that she was prepared to 
settle her family's property claim dispute with Arguello Guzman by 
accepting indemnification bonds (BPIs) issued by the Government of 
Nicaragua (GON) worth an estimated $24,750.  Her attorney finalized 
the settlement on her behalf with the GON on January 15, 2008. 
 
¶3. (SBU) On January 17, 2008, Econoff spoke to Mrs. Raider who 
confirmed that she settled her claim and she had received the BPIs. 
Mrs. Raider lives in Florida and may be contacted at (772) 287-2969. 
 On April 2, 2008, the Embassy Property Office received a copy of 
the settlement document, which Post will forward by e-mail. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Action Request: Post finds sufficient evidence that the 
property dispute between Teodolinda Gonzalez-Becklin and Alejandro 
Bosco Arguello Guzman has been resolved.  Thus, we request the 
Department consider removing his visa ineligibility under Section 
¶2225.
