¶4. Suggested talking points: 
 
-- Limiting foreign investment in the telecom and broadcasting 
sectors impedes innovation and hurts Indonesia's economic and 
technological competitiveness. (Currently foreign investment in 
fixed telecom is limited to 49%, cellular to 65% and media to 20% as 
per last year's negative list). 
 
-- Blocking access to internet websites sends the message that 
Indonesia does not want to be part of a global society that values 
freedom of information. 
 
-- We believe that consumers, not governments, should be the 
ultimate arbiter of what does (or does not) have artistic merit or 
entertainment value. 
 
-- We find that government censorship is often ineffective and 
ultimately counterproductive to our national interests. 
 
-- As President Bush has said, "With freedom comes responsibilities. 
 With freedom comes the responsibility to be thoughtful about 
others."
