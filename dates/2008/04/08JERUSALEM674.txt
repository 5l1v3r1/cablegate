Main Stories: 
------------- 
Black and red Dramatic black and red banner headlines on all front 
pages indicate crisis reporting on the killing of up to 20 
Palestinians in Gaza on April 16.  All papers lead with graphic 
photos of the injured, dead bodies including a Reuters cameraman and 
a destroyed mosque.  Lead stories highlight that most of the victims 
are children.  Coverage expresses anger over the killing of the 
cameraman, with Al Hayat Al Jadida running a photo showing the 
Reuters vehicle clearly marked "TV".  The dailies report that 
Palestinian President Abbas, "strongly condemned the attack," and 
called upon Israel to, "immediately stop its aggression on our 
people."  Speaking to the Voice of Palestine radio, PLO negotiator 
Erekat said that, "escalation will only lead to further 
deterioration in the situation and violence."  He added that the 
attack happened at a time when there were, "great chances of 
achieving a truce and calm in Gaza."  The dailies also report on the 
killing of three Israeli soldiers during clashes with, "Palestinian 
fighters" in Gaza during an early morning Israeli incursion in the 
Strip on April 16. 
 
Wafa News Agency reports that PLO negotiator Erekat called upon the 
American administration on April 16 to investigate the accuracy of 
Israeli claims about the removal of checkpoints and settler outposts 
in the West Bank, stressing that these claims should be viewed as 
part of a, "public relations" campaign.  Another WAFA news report 
runs April 16 comments by the Saudi and Jordanian kings calling upon 
Israel to immediately halt "violations" against the Palestinian 
people and stop settlement activities and lift the "siege" imposed 
on the Gaza Strip. 
 
On inside pages, the three dailies report that PLO negotiator Erekat 
met with NSC advisors Hadley and Abrams and Consul General Walles on 
April 16.  Attendees discussed the agenda for Palestinian President 
Abbas' meeting at the White House next week.  Erekat repeated 
well-known demands for greater US pressure on Israel to implement 
first phase obligations of the road map. 
 
The dailies report that senior Hamas leaders Mahmoud Zahhar and 
Sa'id Siyam headed to Egypt on April 16 to meet with former US 
president Jimmy Carter.  The dailies note further that Isma'il 
Haniyah was also invited to meet with Carter but that he declines 
for, "private reasons."  Ma'an news agency reports that discussions 
with Carter will address the blockade of the Gaza Strip and a 
potential ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinians. 
 
The dailies carried extensive coverage of West Bank activities, 
"honoring Prisoners Day."  Activities included public parades and 
rallies sponsored by relatives of prisoners and political parties. 
Related reports in all papers highlight Israeli Foreign Minister 
Livni, "criticizing" Palestinian President Abbas's plans to, "honor 
six imprisoned Palestinian women," at a ceremony at the Ramallah 
Presidential compound on April 17. 
 
The dailies highlight that Palestinian President Abbas is conducting 
"important" talks with Russian officials.  According to the dailies, 
Abbas will focus on, "developments after Annapolis."  Presidential 
spokesperson Abu Rudaynah explained that Abbas's visit will include 
"in-depth talks" on all issues, especially the status of 
negotiations with Israelis as well as Palestinian-Russian relations. 
 
 
Al-Quds' front page reprints a letter sent by jailed Fatah leader 
 
JERUSALEM 00000674  002 OF 002 
 
 
Marwan Barghouti to Palestinian President Abbas and to the Fatah 
Central Committee and Preparations Committee for the sixth Fatah 
conference.  The letter includes 20 points for Fatah to follow that 
will, according to Barghouti, allow Fatah "to survive and return 
hope to the Palestinians of freedom, independence and justice." 
Related reports in the dailies highlight the Israeli refusal to 
allow former president Carter to meet with Barghouti.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------ 
¶1. Independent Al-Ayyam carries an op-ed by veteran columnist Talal 
Okal entitled, "There is only one exit... (04/17):  "It is clear to 
everyone that the situation in Gaza is miserable.  It has spiraled 
down into the heart of catastrophe where life has become 
unbearable... two years have passed since the siege [of Gaza] began 
after the formation of the Hamas Government following Palestinian 
elections.  Ten months after the Hamas coup [of Gaza], the siege has 
intensified to become complete isolation.  Over [the last 10 
months], Gaza has experienced comprehensive operations of 
destruction that have violated the most basic of human rights, the 
right to life... the unemployment rate has reached 40% and the 
poverty rate has exceeded 75%... in political science [theory] it is 
permissible to consider solving one crisis by creating others, but 
this strategy will not work in [Gaza] because any new crisis will 
only serve to deepen the current one." 
 
¶2. Official Al-Hayat Al-Jadida prints a piece by regular columnist 
Yahia Rabah entitled, "Jimmy Carter!" (04/17):  "During his 
presidency, former president Jimmy Carter created one of the most 
dangerous and important storms in the Middle East - the 
Egyptian-Israeli peace agreement that allowed Egypt to regain the 
Sinai and allowed Israel to raise its flag atop the Israeli Embassy 
in Cairo.  Jimmy Carter has returned to the region 30 years later to 
create a lesser storm by laying a wreath at the tomb of Yasir Arafat 
and criticizing Israeli discriminatory policies and by meeting with 
Hamas officials in Cairo and Damascus.  Carter intends to convince 
Khalid Mash'al, head of the Hamas polit bureau, to accept a peaceful 
resolution with Israel and a peaceful resolution to the conflict 
between Hamas and Fatah.  Regardless of Israeli and the American 
official attempts to insist that the man has no official 
responsibilities, his visit to the region remains important.  It is 
very important, because a man like Carter can transmit his beliefs 
to the American public and influence public opinion... His visit is 
very important to Hamas. I think that Hamas will not miss this 
valuable chance after years of isolation and frozen relations [to 
get their message out]. [They should take] maximum advantage of this 
chance."
