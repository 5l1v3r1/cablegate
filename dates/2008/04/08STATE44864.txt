SUBJECT: RECOGNITION OF EXEMPLARY PERFORMANCE ON BLUE 
LANTERN END-USE CHECKS: YVONNE GONZALES 
 
 
¶1. I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the 
outstanding performance of economic officer Yvonne Gonzales 
for her timely and thorough investigation of Blue Lantern 
cases.  As you know, the Blue Lantern program is the 
Department's primary instrument for monitoring the end-use of 
exported defense articles, technology, and services.  This 
program is indispensable to PM's Directorate of Defense Trade 
Controls (PM/DDTC) in making informed licensing decisions, 
discovering illicit supply networks, and deterring diversions 
of U.S. military articles and technology. 
 
¶2. Since the beginning of FY2008, Ms. Gonzales has managed 12 
Blue Lantern cases, many of them complex and requiring 
considerable effort to complete.  Ms. Gonzales not only 
handled this heavy case load with aplomb, she also provided 
important insights into local procurement systems, most 
importantly the requirement for an Indonesian firm to act as 
supplier and intermediary for all MOD purchases.  This 
information led to the discovery of the involvement in 
proposed transactions of several Indonesian firms that were 
not listed on license applications.  Ms. Gonzales' diligence, 
thoroughness, and professionalism helped PM/DDTC to make more 
informed licensing decisions. 
 
¶3. The PM Bureau and the Department are grateful for the 
efforts of Ms. Gonzales, which have demonstrably contributed 
to the security and integrity of U.S. defense trade.
