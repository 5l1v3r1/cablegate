Dear High Representative Sampaio: 
 
I am pleased to announce that Secretary Rice has 
identified the U.S. Department of State,s Citizen Dialogue 
Program as a program that furthers the objectives of the 
Alliance of Civilizations.  The Citizen Dialogue Program 
sends smallgroups of American Muslims overseas 
to share their experiences with a range of audiences in 
foreign countries.  The goals of the program include 
taking part in an open dialogue about life in America and 
Islam in America, freedom of faith, pluralism, respect, 
and mutual understanding of culture and civilizations. 
This person-to-person program also will develop new 
bridges among diverse communities.  These objectives are 
compatible with Alliance of Civilization's goals of 
furthering understanding between cultures, developing 
links between individuals and groups interested in 
promoting intercultural understanding, and reaching out to 
youth. 
 
The focus of the Citizen Dialogue Program is primarily on 
local Muslim communities, religious leaders, government 
officials, NGOs, business leaders, youth and civil 
society.  Participants share their first-hand experiences 
of life in the United States and also talk with the 
media.  Particular attention is given to young 
people in these communities.  Under this worldwide 
program, American Muslim leaders have visited numerous 
countries in Europe, as well as in Asia, Africa, and the 
Middle East.  In our current fiscal year, four Citizen 
Dialogue teams will visit about a dozen countries in 
Europe, with additional trips to other regions.  The next 
dialogues will be in Spain and Austria in late April. 
 
We look forward to the results of this program. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Kurt Volker 
Acting Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of European and 
Eurasian Affairs
