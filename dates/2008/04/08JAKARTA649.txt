REF: SECSTATE 00017167 
 
¶1.  We contacted Indonesian Air Force CN-235 Procurement Division 
Lieutenant Colonel (LTC) Eddy Supriono on March 25, 2008 to verify 
transaction numbers 050064977, 050060383, and 050053797.  The 
Indonesian Air Force (IAF) does not have direct contact with U.S. 
based Fatair Inc.  According to Supriono, the business transaction 
took place through local supplier PT. Putra Candra Lestari (PCL), 
which is a registered supplier of IAF.  The majority of IAF supply 
transactions utilize an Indonesian-based company, which in turn 
contracts with foreign suppliers.  In this case, PCL purchased parts 
on behalf of IAF from Fatair. 
 
¶2.  Supriono confirmed that IAF received the items detailed in 
reftel in full for license numbers 050053797 and 050060383 and that 
the goods are being used for the purpose as stated on the licenses. 
LTC Supriono said that there is no shipment yet for license 
050064977 and that it is a "blanket export license order".  The 
blanket license, according to Supriono, is for a future order.  He 
said PCL will forward more funds to Fatair for the upcoming 
contract.  Once an order from IAF is confirmed, PCL will send a 
wire-transfer of the funds to Fatair and the export license will 
already be available in order to speed up the process.
