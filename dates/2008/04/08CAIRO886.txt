¶1. (SBU) On April 23, Amira Fahmy of the MFA Human Rights office 
told us that the GOE was "disappointed" that the interim Trafficking 
in Persons (TIP) report on Egypt states that Egypt has only made 
"minimal progress" on combating TIP during the reporting period. 
Fahmy said that the National Coordinating Committee to Combat and 
Prevent Trafficking in Persons has established a drafting committee 
to draft new, comprehensive anti-TIP legislation.  Fahmy expected 
the legislation to be completed by July and introduced to parliament 
in the 2008 - 2009 parliamentary session.  Additionally, Fahmy noted 
that the new anti-TIP unit in the National Council for Childhood and 
Motherhood (NCCM) has arranged seminars since February to educate 
security personnel on identifying victims of trafficking.  Finally, 
she said that the GOE is undertaking a comprehensive, Egypt-wide 
assessment of trafficking networks in the country, and is not 
limiting its research efforts to just the Sinai.  Fahmy noted that 
the GOE hoped to see these points mentioned in the annual TIP report 
when it is released in summer 2008. 
 
¶2. (SBU) We commended Fahmy on the progress she mentioned, but 
emphasized the importance of measurable results.  We also noted that 
the child protection law with anti-TIP provisions is still pending 
in parliament (ref A).  The comprehensive anti-TIP law has not yet 
been drafted.  In addition, we noted that NCCM's recent training 
activities fall outside the reporting period for the interim report, 
as well as for the upcoming annual report.
