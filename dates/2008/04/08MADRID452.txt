(SBU)  The DCM delivered reftel demarche to Spanish MFA 
Political Director Rafael Dezcallar on April 21.  Dezcallar 
sought to clarify the Spanish position, stating that Spain 
does not oppose an eventual role for the OSCE inside 
Afghanistan, and that indeed such a role would be the ideal 
end result of OSCE involvement.  However, in the immediate 
term, Spain would support initial efforts to develop the 
project outside and along the Afghan borders before putting a 
presence on the ground within Afghanistan.  Dezcallar said 
that the security risks of working in Afghanistan were an 
obvious concern at such an early stage in the project's 
development.  Nevertheless, OSCE involvement in Afghan border 
issues without an eventual physical presence in Afghanistan 
would be counter-intuitive.
