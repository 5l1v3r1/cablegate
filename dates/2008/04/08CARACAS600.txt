¶1. (SBU) On April 29 labor negoiations between General Motors 
(GM) and its union reached a breaking point.  GM Venezuela's 
legal counsel confirmed media reports that GM stopped 
production as a result of the impasse.  In response to the 
halt in production, GM workers rioted, damaged 28 cars, and 
blew up a gas tank.  Two employees were injured.  (Note: 
Media reports erroneously stated that 780 vehicles were 
damaged. End Note.) 
 
¶2. (SBU) GM then reached an interim agreement with the labor 
union "Syndicate of Winning Socialists" on April 30 and 
resumed normal production of 400 vehicles per day.  GM was 
able to resume production when they met the union's demands 
for improved cafeteria food and better quality toilet paper. 
Production may halt again if GM cannot come to an agreement 
with the union on their proposed salary increase of roughly 
USD 16 per day versus GM's offer of USD 9.50.  Production is 
continuing normally at Ford and Goodyear.  Both reached 
hard-fought agreements with their unions in 2007. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Chrysler, which halted production in March 2008, 
plans to re-start in mid-May (reftel.)  Chrysler Venezuela 
President Luis Perez De La Cruz told the Embassy Chrysler 
halted production because they could not get enough dollars 
from CADIVI, the BRV foreign exchange agency, to pay their 
suppliers.  De La Cruz went to CADIVI weekly requesting the 
funds which CADIVI finally released the second week in April.
