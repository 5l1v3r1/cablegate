¶1. (SBU) Summary: President Yudhoyono is set to approve a 25% fuel 
price increase at a Cabinet meeting next Monday, according to the 
Ministry of Finance (MOF).  The Government of Indonesia (GOI) wants 
to demonstrate its commitment to fiscal sustainability in light of 
high oil prices, a rising subsidy bill, and a flagging macroeconomic 
outlook.  To reduce negative domestic reactions, the GOI will 
implement a cash transfer program for poor households to offset the 
economic costs of the fuel price increase.  The fuel price increase, 
scheduled for June, is largely optics for financial markets as the 
subsidy and overall budget savings are minimal.  Long-term 
macroeconomic challenges remain, particularly with rising inflation 
projections.  End Summary. 
 
President to Approve Fuel Price Increase on May 5 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶2. (SBU) President Yudhoyono has informally approved a 25% fuel 
price increase, but will convene a Cabinet meeting on May 5 to 
officially sign off on the plan, according to MOF Fiscal Policy head 
Anggito Abimanyu.  The price hike will increase regular gas (called 
"Premium") from Rp 4,500 ($0.50; Rp 9,000/USD) to Rp 6,000 ($0.67) 
per liter, still below international market rates of Rp 8,000 
($0.89) per liter.  The lowest cost gas (called "Solar") will 
increase from Rp 4,300 ($0.48) to Rp 5,500 ($0.61) per liter.  The 
higher quality, unsubsidized gas (called "Pertamax") will remain at 
Rp 8,300 ($0.92) per liter.  Kerosene will also increase 25%, from 
Rp 2,000 ($0.23) to Rp 2,500 ($0.28) per liter. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The actual budget savings based on this fuel price increase 
is minimal.  The fuel price increase will reduce the GOI's subsidy 
bill by Rp 25 trillion ($2.78 billion), roughly 10% of the overall 
subsidy bill and 2.5% of the entire budget.  However, the GOI will 
use about 50% (Rp 11.5 trillion; $1.28 billion) of the savings for a 
cash transfer program.  Beginning in June, the GOI will disburse Rp 
100,000 ($11.11) to poor households every three months.  The GOI 
wants to present this fiscal policy decision as pro-poor to counter 
potential domestic criticisms that fiscal policy improvements are 
made at the expense of the poor. 
 
Fuel Price Increase: Largely Optics for Markets 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶4. (SBU) The GOI hopes to assuage the financial markets with the 
fuel price increase, according to Abimanyu.  The fuel price hike 
will buy the GOI a short reprieve from market scrutiny, but will not 
fundamentally alter long-term fiscal challenges and risk 
assessments, according to MOF and private bank contacts.  High oil 
prices, a rising subsidy bill, and high inflation have led to 
increasing financial market uncertainty, particularly in the past 
four months.  Financial markets have been waiting for this fiscal 
policy move.  Investor concerns have driven 10 year yields on 
government bonds to 13%, up from 10% in January 2008.  The fuel 
price increase should improve market perceptions, but it also leaves 
one large problem: inflation.  The MOF estimates inflation to be 
11.1% this year (6.5% core inflation; 2.5% volatile commodity 
prices; 2.1% administered/fuel price increase).  Financial markets 
will now look to the central bank to begin raising interest rates to 
reign in inflation. 
 
Long-Term Fiscal Outlook Still in Question 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶5. (SBU) The GOI is still considering additional long-term fiscal 
sustainability measures.  GOI officials are evaluating an overall 
cap on fuel subsidies that would limit the fuel subsidy bill to 
three percent of GDP, roughly Rp 132 trillion ($14.67 billion). 
Although MOF officials claimed that this cap was already in place, 
there is no provision in the budget law yet, according to a senior 
Parliament Budget Committee contact.  Capping the subsidy bill would 
have an even more positive effect on markets due to countering 
perceptions of an unlimited subsidy bill, according to World Bank 
Jakarta's lead economist Bill Wallace.  Regardless, the GOI will 
likely overshoot this "three percent" subsidy rule this year, 
according to Abimanyu. 
 
¶6. (SBU) The MOF is proposing an automatic price adjustment 
mechanism for fuel as a long-term strategy to reduce subsidies. 
Abimanyu suggested a monthly Rp 500 ($0.06) or Rp 1,000 ($0.11) per

liter increase to gradually move fuel prices to international market 
rates.  However, he said that this proposal was in its preliminary 
stages.  The MOF is also implementing a pilot project on fuel "smart 
cards," which would limit fuel consumption per person.  The pilot 
project will be limited initially to two cities (Denpasar, Bali and 
Batam); nationwide implementation is not expected in the near term. 
 
 
Protests, Political Implications of Fuel Price Hike 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶7. (SBU) The GOI is anticipating some political economic fallout 
from this fuel price hike, but is taking action to limit negative 
reactions, according to our contacts.  The intensity of this 
reaction is uncertain.  In 2003, the Megawati administration 
reversed their original fuel price increase due to violent protests. 
 In 2005, the 125% fuel price increase led to strong, but manageable 
protests.  Inflation stabilized within six months of the 2005 fuel 
price increase.  The current cash transfer program is designed to 
dampen any potential public backlash, according to Abimanyu.  In 
addition, the GOI is leaking the fuel price increase proposal to 
test the waters for possible protests and financial market reactions 
ahead of next week's Cabinet meeting to announce the fuel price 
increase.  Due to wide political support for the fuel price 
increase, protests are likely to be minimal, according to our 
contacts.
