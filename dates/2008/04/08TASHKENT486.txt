TURKISH BID 
 
REF: STATE 41999 
 
¶1. (SBU) P/E Chief delivered reftel demarche April 22 to 
Ismat Faizullaev, head of MFA's U.S. Affairs Section. 
Faizullaev had no immediate reaction but promised to share it 
with other offices at MFA, including the head of the UN and 
International Oganizations Office. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The EBRD's alternate director for Turkey and 
Uzbekistan (among others in the grouping), Turan Oz, is 
visiting Tashkent next week and has requested a meeting April 
29 with Ambassador and the Political and Economic Section. 
We expect Oz to raise the Turkish proposal.  We welcome input 
from Department ahead of this meeting, particularly any 
information on Oz's own inclinations. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Post has outstanding requests to meet with officials 
at the Ministries of Foreign Economic Relations and Finance, 
both of which will likely be involved in the final decision 
on Uzbekistan's position.  Unfortunately, access to these 
agencies remains limited, with all requests passing through a 
lengthy screening process at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' 
protocol office, and possibly the Presidential Apparat and 
the National Security Service.
