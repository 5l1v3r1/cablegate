SUBJECT: SPAIN ENCOURAGES GREATER REGIONAL ENGAGEMENT WITH 
IRAQ 
 
REF: STATE 035471 
 
¶1. Spanish MFA Deputy Director for Middle East Affairs, 
Alberto Ucelay, in response to reftel demarche, said that 
Spain also seeks greater regional engagement with Iraq. As 
the new Spanish cabinet is being formed this week, he was not 
able to share specific details about Spanish FM participation 
in upcoming conferences, but assured us that Spain would work 
for additional support for Iraq. Spain will also continue to 
fulfill its financial pledges. 
 
¶2.  The Spanish MFA reports that it disbursed 100 percent of 
the Madrid Conference Pledge, with the qualifying information 
that some concessional loans have not been finalized due to 
Iraqi capacity issues.  The Spanish MFA said that specific 
project proposals for the concessional loans are pending at 
this time. 
 
¶3.  Spain also participates, through the EU initiative EUJUST 
LEX, in efforts to rebuild Iraqi capacity.  In the second 
half of 2007 Spain trained 39 police officials, 20 prison 
officials and 25 judges.  In March, Spain hosted a delegation 
of Iraqi electoral commission employees to learn about the 
Spanish general elections and democratic practices.  There 
are plans to continue the programming in 2008. 
 
¶4.  With regard to Iraqi displaced persons, Spain contributed 
800,000 euros to an EU program to alleviate the situation in 
Jordan and Syria.
