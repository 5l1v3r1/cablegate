GRADUATE FROM USG FUNDED LEBANON POLICE PROGRAM 
 
 
¶1. (U) Summary. The first class of 166 Lebanese Internal Security 
Forces (ISF) police cadets trained under the USG sponsored Lebanon 
Police Program graduated on April 15, 2008. The graduation ceremony 
took place at the ISF Academy located in Warwar, a suburb of Beirut, 
and featured a sixty piece marching band and precision marches by 
the graduating police recruits. Flanking the graduates and band were 
an impressive array of police vehicles, SUVs and refurbished Armored 
Personnel Vehicles, all donated by the USG to the ISF and funded 
through the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement 
Affairs (INL). 
 
¶2. (U) The graduation was attended by the Director General of the 
ISF, Achraf Rifi, his entire Command Staff and 32 of the ISF's 
highest ranking officers, as well as by U.S. Charg d'Affaires CDA) 
Michele J. Sison, Embassy INL Office Director and the U.S. and 
Lebanese Police Program Training staff. 
 
¶3. (U) Charge Sison congratulated the first class of 166 graduates 
trained under the INL Lebanon Police Program. The ten week training 
program in modern policing and law enforcement skills is taught by 
U.S. instructors and curriculum developers with the assistance of 
Lebanese police and legal advisors as well as translators and 
language assistants. End Summary. 
 
U.S. Announces Police Visitor Program 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) Charge Sison announced to the graduating class the 
inauguration of a new Police Visitor Program, funded by INL Lebanon, 
to honor the top students and instructors, and those officers who 
have played a significant role in police training. These 
high-achieving police and leading officers will spend 10 days 
visiting police departments, academies, and criminal investigations 
units in the U.S. to observe their operations and to exchange best 
practices with their police counterparts. Serving as a motivational 
incentive for future classes, the Visitor's Program will also 
increase the professionalism of the ISF by forging international 
relationships and strengthening operational knowledge. 
 
Impassioned Speech by ISF Commander 
------------------------------------ 
¶5.  (U) As part of his impassioned review of the challenges facing 
the ISF, General Rifi stated the following in his prepared remarks: 
 
 
"Criminal actors continue to attempt to kill the best men of our 
country, who are targets for the sole reason that they believed in 
the independence of this country and its right to full sovereignty 
over all its territories. 
 
Terrorist crimes were perpetrated against our forces and those of 
the Lebanese Army. Hence, the blood of all these martyrs became the 
first cornerstone upon which we built the trust between our forces 
and the Lebanese citizens. 
 
The battles we fought were patriotic battles above all else, and the 
missions we accomplished were national missions of excellence.... 
 
Because of the lack of financial resources, it was not possible to 
obtain all that we needed, all at the same time.... 
 
The support of the Lebanese government and the Minister of the 
Interior and Municipalities was essential to develop the ISF 
organization. In addition, the Lebanese Army command thankfully 
agreed to assist us.   I can assure you that the cooperation between 
these two institutions is continuing and at its best.... 
 
We know that our units have the right to ask for more officers, 
training and equipment and we will meet their needs. The Lebanese 
citizen too has the right to claim security and protection, while 
preserving his human dignity. 
 
I appreciate the unit commanders' patience with the lack of 
resources but it is now time to accelerate the pace, and I promise 
to provide their units with what they need. Our fetus has ended its 
creation phase and has now entered the development phase. Soon the 
Lebanese citizen shall see the results of our efforts. 
 
[The United States'] aid amounting to 60 million dollars was 
allotted to equipment, training and rehabilitation.... This 
assistance and the assistance provided by other friendly countries 
have played an important role in improving our capability to 
confront terrorism in Lebanon.

This assistance enabled us to uncover the terrorist and criminal 
role of the group named "Fatah Al Islam".  Through concrete proof 
and scientific evidence, we were able to prove the involvement of 
Fatah al Islam in the terrorist attacks of Ain Aalak, and succeeded, 
subsequently, in crushing this group in Tripoli and Naher El Bared 
Camp.  During these fierce fights, our forces worked hand in hand 
with the Lebanese Army, who paid a high price and bore heavy 
casualties in the battlefield in order to protect our 
territories.... 
 
I avail myself of this great occasion to show the whole world that 
we are following a clear and pragmatic plan whose success depends on 
our mission and capabilities. 
Allow me, in this occasion, to congratulate everyone of you on the 
efforts that you put forth to make this session a success; we are 
very proud of your commitment, discipline, devotion and skill." 
 
¶6. (U) Press coverage of the graduation was extensive.  The main 
broadcast news stations covered the speeches the marching pageantry 
with great interest, and zoomed in on the new U.S. police cars, 
topped with their lights and sirens, and festooned with the ISF logo 
and new 999 emergency call number.  Although Al Manar was not at the 
ceremony, the Hizbollah backed TV station gained access to the 
footage and devoted more airtime to the graduation than did the 
other more moderate stations. 
 
Continuing Basic Police and Instructor Training 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
¶7. (U) The next Basic Police training class for police recruits 
begins April 21, 2008. Over the next four years the INL program aims 
to train 8,000 police recruits and 1,200 instructors. Two Instructor 
training courses have been completed, and those graduates are now 
assisting in the basic training program.
