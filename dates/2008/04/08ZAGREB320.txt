Â¶1.  Non paper was delivered to Sanja Bujas-Juraga, Head of 
International Security Department at Croatia's Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, on April 9, 2008.  Bujas-Juraga welcomed 
this clarification and noted that the GoC fully supports and 
implements these measures.  In early June, Croatia will 
co-host with Romania a NATO-sponsored regional conference on 
implementation of UN sanctions to prevent the proliferation 
of WMD and expects participation from across southeast Europe.
