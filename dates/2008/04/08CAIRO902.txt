SUBJECT:  USAID DEMOCRACY AND GOVERNANCE PROGRAMS:  THE WAY FORWARD 
 
We agree that the best way forward to determine FY 2008 spending 
levels on democracy and governance programs in Egypt is option 
three, selected by the April 11 Senior Level Working Group.  This 
option sets a $48 million floor for spending on democracy and 
governance programs.  We would also support an assessment to 
determine if and how the additional $19 million that is "ring 
fenced" can be spent on D&G programs in Egypt.  Post warmly invites 
representatives from MEPI and DRL to participate in the assessment 
that begins May 18.
