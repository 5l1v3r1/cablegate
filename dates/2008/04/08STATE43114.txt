SUBJECT: GUIDANCE FOR UNMIS CONSULTATIONS 
 
 
 Â¶1.  USUN is requested to draw on the following points for 
the UN Security Council briefing and consultations on the UN 
Mission in Sudan (UNMIS), scheduled for April 24. 
 
 
We welcome the Secretary General's report on UNMIS.  We 
appreciate the efforts of UN personnel and troop contributors 
to make this crucial operation work, despite the difficult 
operating environment.  We believe it is critical that UNMIS 
succeed in its mission to help the Sudanese implement the 
Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA).  We note that the CPA 
ended a two decades long conflict that left two million dead 
and four million displaced and we believe that the full, 
rigorous, and effective implementation of the CPA is the 
cornerstone for any enduring peace in Sudan.  With that in 
mind, I would like to make four points: 
 
 
First, we urge both parties, the National Congress Party and 
Sudan People's Liberation Movement, to resolve the situation 
in Abyei.  We are concerned about rising tensions in the area 
between some Misseriya elements and the Sudan People's 
Liberation Army.  We welcome UNMIS' good offices and 
peacekeeping activities in support of this endeavor.  We urge 
progress on North-South border demarcation to facilitate a 
long-term solution to the crisis.  And we take note of the 
Secretary General's recommendation that UNMIS be authorized 
 
SIPDIS 
to provide technical assistance to the border demarcation 
process. 
 
-- We urge both parties to redeploy their troops from the 
border immediately to reduce the risk of a return to violence. 
 
Second, we welcome the conduct of the census in Sudan which 
is an important milestone in the implementation of the CPA, 
and urge all citizens to participate.  We call on all parties 
to do their utmost to ensure the comprehensive, peaceful and 
safe conduct of the census.  We urge the Government of Sudan 
and the Government of Southern Sudan to facilitate the 
orderly conduct of the census in all parts of Sudan. 
 
-- We also look forward to the 2009 elections in Sudan, and 
welcome UNMIS' assistance with elections preparation, in 
consultation with the government of Sudan and in accordance 
with UNMIS' mandate.  We urge our international partners to 
join us in the provision of election assistance. 
 
Third, the CPA is essential to peace throughout Sudan, 
including Darfur.  The ongoing violence in Darfur threatens 
to undermine the CPA.  We call upon the Government of Sudan 
to facilitate the rapid and complete deployment of UNAMID, 
and to urge all parties to the conflict to participate in the 
peace process in Darfur.  We urge all parties, particularly 
the rebel groups, to cease attacks on humanitarian convoys. 
 
Finally, we want to emphasize the importance of UNMIS' 
continued effective operations.  Important positions such as 
the Deputy SRSG or the Force Commander must not remain vacant 
for any length of time.  We support the Secretariat's efforts 
to fill any vacancies promptly with the most capable leaders.
