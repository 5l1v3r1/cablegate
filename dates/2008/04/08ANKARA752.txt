In Today's Papers 
 
European Parliament Adopts Turkey Report 
All papers report the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign 
Affairs adopted Ria Oomen-Ruijten's draft report on Turkey.  The 
draft report received 53 votes in favor, two against, and four 
abstentions.  The final voting on the report will be completed in 
May.  The report expresses concern over the possible closure of the 
AKP, and hopes the Constitutional Court makes its decision in line 
with the principles of law, European standards, and the Venice 
Criteria.  It calls on the Turkish government to respect pluralism, 
secularism, and democracy while continuing reforms.  The report 
calls on the lawmakers and mayors of the pro-Kurdish DTP to put a 
clear distance between themselves and the PKK terrorist 
organization.  It also calls on the government to launch a civilian 
initiative that aims for a permanent resolution to the Kurdish 
question.  The report urges Turkey to investigate the underground 
Ergenekon terrorist network and its connections within the state. 
 
Mainstream Hurriyet, under the headline, "The EU Report Is like a 
Lesson in Democracy," criticizes the AKP government for the way the 
headscarf reforms were handled, because the committee says, "the 
headscarf reforms should have been part of a broader democratic 
reform package."  Islamist-oriented Zaman writes, "the EU is 
unanimous: if the AKP is closed, it will harm Turkey's EU accession 
talks."  A commentary in mainstream Sabah says "Banning peaceful and 
democratic political parties violates the Copenhagen Criteria and 
the Venice Criteria.  It also means the suspension of Turkey's 
relations with the EU." 
 
Cumhuriyet, Radikal, and Milliyet report Croatia moved a step toward 
joining the European Union with new accession talks on transport and 
energy.  Mainstream Milliyet notes that, due to Turkey's internal 
political problems, Turkey is behind Croatia in EU accession talks. 
Turkey and Croatia began EU membership talks at the same time, but 
Croatia is halfway to full membership while Turkey has to wait for 
at least ten more years, papers comment.  Meanwhile, EU Enlargement 
Commissioner Olli Rehn said Turkey could join the European Union in 
10-15 years if it continues the reforms. 
 
May 1 Designated 'Labor and Solidarity Day' in Turkey 
All papers report on Monday, the Council of Ministers decided to 
celebrate May 1 as "Labor and Solidarity Day," but stopped short of 
declaring it an official holiday.  Government spokesman Cemil Cicek 
told the press yesterday Turkey was going through "economic 
stagnation," and added that making May 1 official holiday would cost 
the country "2 billion YTL."  Cicek also said Istanbul's Taksim 
Square would not be opened to celebrations or other activities on 
May 1.  Istanbul Governor Muammer Guler and Mayor Kadir Topbas also 
rejected the request, saying Taksim Square would not be used for 
rallies anymore.  Labor unions, however, insist on celebrating May 
Day in Taksim Square, according to papers.  Under the headline, "AKP 
Mocks Workers," leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet quotes labor union 
leaders as saying "The AKP government wants the EU Criteria for 
itself, but imposes the 'AKP Criteria' on Turkey's working class." 
 
Austria's Foreign Minister Plassnik Visits Turkey 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Zaman and others 
report Austrian Foreign Minister Ursula Plassnik held a joint press 
conference with her Turkish counterpart Ali Babacan.  Plassnik told 
the press the EU should not be expected to act as a "referee" on 
"sensitive" matters such as secularism and the closure case against 
the AKP.  Plassnik emphasized the doors of EU should not be closed 
for Turkey.  Turkish FM Ali Babacan pointed out Turkey's intentions 
to normalize ties with Armenia.  "Turkeys' dialogue channels with 
Armenia are open.  We have new preparations, and ready to share them 
with the new Armenian government," Babacan said.  Papers report 
Babacan told Plassnik Turkey was uncomfortable with Austria's 
reluctance to extradite three PKK leaders -- Riza Altun, Remzi 
Kartal, and Cihan Yildiz -- to Turkey.

Iraqi General Abadi Meets Turkish Military Leaders 
Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Milliyet, and Zaman report the Iraqi military 
General Staff's second-in-charge General Nasier Abadi met Turkish 
General Staff (TGS) chief General Yasar Buyukanit and TGS deputy 
chief General Ergin Saygun in Ankara on Monday.  The generals 
discussed the U.S.-Turkey-Iraq mechanism against terror, the PKK, 
Turkish cross border incursions into Iraq, and the training of the 
Iraqi military, say papers. 
 
Editorial Commentary on U.S. Elections 
 
"Obama, Clinton and McCain" 
Ilter Turkmen wrote in mainstream Hurriyet (4/21): "At the beginning 
of the presidential race, almost everybody expected Democrats to 
beat Republicans because of the controversial war in Iraq.  However 
the Republicans made a smart move by voting for McCain.  As for the 
Democrats, the in-party competition continues everyday between 
Hillary Clinton and Barack Hussein Obama.  The Pennsylvania primary 
will determine the upcoming picture of the Democratic Party.  Obama 
has an advantage of being a dynamic and charismatic personality.  He 
has the courage to speak up.  Some are using cheap politics against 
him.  His candidacy, in fact, is an indication of real democracy. 
Many European countries are already in close contact with the three 
front runners and their staffers.  Turkey better do the same thing 
as soon as possible." 
 
"Will Obama Be Successful?" 
Yasemin Congar observed in leftist Taraf (4/21): "Barack Obama is 
likely to win the Democratic nomination and chances are he will be 
the new president of the United States.  Blue collar whites comprise 
roughly 48 percent of the voting population.  If blue collar whites 
in Pennsylvania vote for Obama, then we can hope for a change in the 
US."
