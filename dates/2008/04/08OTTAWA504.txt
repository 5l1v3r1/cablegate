(SBU)  In response to reftel demarche, Senior Policy Analyst 
Michael Blackmore in the Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade said Canada was very pleased with the 
inclusion of Bahrain in the GI and the news was very timely, 
since Canada is just getting invitations out this week to a 
conference on the security of radiological sources which it 
is hosting June 10-12.  The GOC would be very pleased to have 
Bahrain participate and will send an invite when it has the 
point of contact.
