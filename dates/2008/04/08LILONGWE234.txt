SUBJECT: Malawi Government Calls for Release of Zimbabwe Election 
Results 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: In a statement released on April 19, the GOM 
called on the Zimbabwe Government to release the election results so 
that "a Government can be formed that will steer the country to the 
future."  Reiterating the SADC principle of "non-interference," the 
GOM expressed concern over the economic and political issues facing 
the people of Zimbabwe.  Adding that it believes Zimbabweans "should 
not live in the past," the GOM called for new negotiations "to 
reconcile differences," including a resumption of the Zimbabwe-UK 
talks that followed the Lancaster House Agreement.  Regarding 
Zimbabwean discussions with the UK Government, the GOM stated, "even 
when a new Government is constituted, dialogue between Britain and 
Zimbabwe will still be necessary."  Prior to this statement, Malawi 
had not strayed from the SADC line.  It appears that the GOM has 
begun to soften that stance and may be opening up to the possibility 
of Mugabe's fall.  End summary. 
 
Malawi Calls for Release of Election Results 
-------------------------------------------- 
¶2. (SBU) In a statement released on April 19, the GOM stated it is 
"ready to work with any Government that will emerge in Zimbabwe, 
based on the will of the people as expressed through the general 
elections."  The statement adds that "it is important that the 
results of the general elections that took place recently need to be 
published so that a Government can be formed that will steer the 
country to the future." 
 
¶3. (SBU) Noting the SADC principle of non-interference in the 
internal affairs of a sovereign state, the GOM went on to commend 
the work of South African President Mbeki in "bringing the ZANU-PF 
and the MDC to the negotiating table that led to the holding of the 
recent General Elections." 
 
Zimbabwe Should Not Live in the Past - Call for New Negotiations 
------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) The GOM stated its belief that Zimbabweans "should not live 
in the past.  They must move on."  The statement added, "therefore, 
we believe that a new set of negotiations could be initiated at 
different levels ... to air their views, to listen to one another 
and to reconcile their differences." 
 
¶5. (SBU) Specifically, the GOM called for the resumption of the 
negotiations between Zimbabwe and the United Kingdom "that took 
place following the Lancaster House Agreement."  The GOM claims that 
the breakdown of those talks contributed to the current situation, 
and it called for a "new atmosphere of understanding and mutual 
trust between the two governments as the basis for solving the 
Zimbabwe crisis."  The statement added that "even when a new 
Government is constituted, dialogue between Britain and Zimbabwe 
will still be necessary." 
 
¶6. (SBU) The GOM called for new negotiations between the GOZ and 
white farmers "to deal with the issue of land resettlement."  Malawi 
also called for the strengthening of the dialogue between the 
Government of Zimbabwe and the MDC "to look at the underlying 
political crisis and to remove the current deadlock. The release of 
all the results of the recent elections is the necessary condition 
for such dialogue." 
 
Comment 
------- 
¶7. (SBU) The GOM has not strayed far from the SADC line on Zimbabwe 
- until now.  By calling for the release of election results, 
terming the situation a "crisis," and appearing to lay the 
groundwork for reconciliation through ongoing and broad-based 
negotiations, the GOM is taking a welcome step out of SADC's shadow, 
perhaps even opening to the possibility of a new government in 
Zimbabwe. Our GOM contacts are spinning this statement as reflecting 
a great deal of nuance and a new attitude on their part.
