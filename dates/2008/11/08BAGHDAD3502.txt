SUBJECT: MOU BETWEEN BAGHDAD AMANAT AND USG 
 
¶1.  (U) The Baghdad Amanat signed a Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU) with USG that marks a turning point in 
the coordination of U.S. reconstruction efforts in the 
Capital. The MOU is the result of a six month long 
coordinated effort on the part of the Provincial Projects 
Management Section of the Baghdad PRT.  The MOU brings 
together all interested parties and will facilitate and 
streamline construction activities in Baghdad.  The MOU was 
signed by the Baghdad Amanat, Gulf Region Division (GRD), 
Provincial Reconstruction Team ) Baghdad (PRT-B), Joint 
Contracting Command Iraq/Afghanistan (JCCI/A), and 
Multi-National Division ) Baghdad (MND-B).  The agreement 
spells out procedures and standards for U.S. facilitated 
reconstruction projects and solidifies the partnership 
between the Amanat and the four US parties responsible for 
reconstruction efforts within the city of Baghdad. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The MOU developed out of a seven point letter sent 
from the Baghdad Deputy Mayor for Technical Affairs Mr. 
Ibrahim Mustafa to the GRD Commanding General BG Dorko.  The 
letter requested US agencies follow Iraqi standards for 
construction project execution.  Specifically, the Mayor 
wanted the US to use the Iraqi contractor classification 
method when awarding contracts, in order to prevent 
unqualified contractors from taking on projects larger than 
their scope of experience.  The Mayor also asked for Iraqi 
participation and oversight of projects.  The MOU addresses 
the Mayor's concerns and creates a process for project 
development, execution, and turn-over procedures. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The PRT served as the coordinator for the MOU 
negotiations and drafter for the document language, including 
translation of the final technical language.  During the 
final stages of negotiating the MOU, the PRT played a pivotal 
role in ensuring the MOU provided for the interests of the 
Amanat as well as the Coalition Forces. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) This MOU process will be shared with other PRTs as 
a Best Practice to facilitate greater cooperation with 
provincial authorities and to ensure projects, from 
conception to execution, meet Iraqi government standards and 
regulations.
