Â¶1. (SBU) On November 10, Econoff advised MFA's Deputy 
Director for Multilateral Economic and Maritime Relations 
Juan Luis Munoz de Laborde of the US's strong concerns on 
Article 10 of the EU proposed "third maritime safety" 
regulation (reftel).  Econoff explained that this provision 
would interfere with the manner in which non-EU countries 
carried out their safety oversight responsibilities towards 
vessels carrying their flag.  Munoz de Laborde indicated that 
he had not been aware of the controversy associated with this 
provision and said he would discuss this issue with Spain's 
Merchant Marine representatives to determine what Spain's 
position, if any, would be.  He indicated that he would 
contact Econoff at a later date to discuss this matter 
further.
