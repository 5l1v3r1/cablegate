REF:  STATE 122053 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) On November 19, we shared reftel non-paper regarding the 
USG objectives for the UN-organized Doha conference on Financing for 
Development with Viktor Zagregov, Head of the UN Section in the 
MFA's International Organizations Department, and Grigoriy Ustinov, 
a second secretary in Zagregov's section.  On November 20, Zagregov 
told us he would attend the Doha conference and appreciated 
receiving the U.S. non-paper, but the GOR did not have any 
substantive reaction at this point.  He explained that the GOR was 
still finalizing its positions for the Doha conference, and, without 
identifying specific issues, noted that the Russian delegation in 
Doha would have discretion to decide many questions on the spot 
without consulting with Moscow.  On November 24, Ustinov advised us 
that the MFA had discussed the U.S. non-paper with the Ministry of 
Finance, but still did not have a substantive reaction.  Ustinov 
also noted that Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Aleksey 
Kudrin would head the Russian delegation in Doha.
