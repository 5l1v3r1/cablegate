SUBJECT: ISRAEL MEDIA REACTION 
 
-------------------------------- 
SUBJECTS COVERED IN THIS REPORT: 
-------------------------------- 
 
Election of Barack Obama to President 
 
------------------------- 
Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Leading media reported that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is 
arriving in the region today. 
 
All mainstream media led with the election of Sen. Barack Obama to 
President of the U.S.  Banners in Yediot: QAmericaQs HopeQ; Maariv: 
QThe ChosenQ; Israel Hayom: QThe Obama EraQ; and The Jerusalem Post: 
QTriumphant Obama: Change Has Come to America.Q  HaQaretz chose to 
highlight ObamaQs comment in his victory speech: QThat's the true 
genius of America, that America can change.Q  The first page of the 
newspaper is a full translation of the speech. 
 
All media reported that president-elect Obama has offered the post 
of White House Chief of Staff to Rep. Rahm Emanuel (D- IL).  His 
father is a former Israeli who was a member of Menachem BeginQs 
Irgun underground movement. 
 
HaQaretz reported that the purpose of PM Ehud OlmertQs visit to 
President Bush later this month will be an attempt to reach last 
minute agreements and extract a number of promises before both 
leaders step down.  Olmert is looking for commitments from Bush on 
the peace process with the Palestinians, U.S. military aid and 
various arms deals. 
 
Media reported that yesterday PM Olmert congratulated Obama and 
said: "U.S.-Israeli ties are special and based on shared values and 
interests that manifest themselves in close cooperation.  Israel and 
the U.S. have a joint interest to improve relations." HaQaretz 
reported that FM and Kadima Chairwoman told the Knesset, in 
criticism of Likud Chairman Benjamin Netanyahu: QIf Israel 
represents itself as a country that opposes any [peace] process then 
the world, headed by the U.S., will try to force processes on it. 
Just saying 'no' has never helped Israel in any diplomatic sphere." 
Leading media quoted U.S. Ambassador to Israel James Cunningham as 
saying yesterday at a reception at JerusalemQs King David Hotel that 
Barack Obama will be a Qgreat president and a great friend of 
 
Israel.Q  The Jerusalem Post noted that Cunningham declared that it 
was a proud day in American history and part of a process, and 
lauded John McCain for Qhis incredibly gracious concession speech. 
HaQaretz reported that Obama could replace Cunningham immediately. 
 
Many media and social activists wish for an QIsraeli ObamaQ: QWhy 
not an Ethiopian, Arab, or Yemenite PM? 
 
Israel Radio reported that last night the IDF attacked Islamic Jihad 
positions in northern Gaza, killing an Islamic Jihad militant. 
 
The Jerusalem Post quoted police as saying that PM Olmert will 
undergo a ninth round of investigation from the National Fraud Unit 
tomorrow. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that yesterday the homes of East 
Jerusalem Arabs were demolished, prompting riots. 
 
Israel Radio reported that MK Israel Hasson, No. 2 in Yisrael 
Beiteinu and former deputy head of Shin Bet, has joined Kadima.

Summary: 
-------- 
 
The independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz editorialized: QIn an era 
when America became anathema in the world, and the Wall Street 
crisis dragged its people and many people all over the globe to the 
abyss of uncertainty and fear of the future, America chose the 
chance for peace and dialogue and socioeconomic repair in the spirit 
of the New Deal. 
 
The conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized: QThe 
members of the new administration will see with their own eyes that 
no one wants peace more than Israel.  No one.  Congratulations 
President-elect Obama on a historic victory.  Godspeed. 
 
Liberal columnist Yael Paz-Melamed wrote in the popular, pluralist 
Maariv: QA new wind will blow from the White House -Q not a hostile 
one, but a different one. 
 
Chief Economic Editor Sever Plotker wrote in the mass-circulation, 
pluralist Yediot Aharonot: QObamaQs electrifying election call, Qyes 
we can!Q becomes, for president-elect Obama a tough personal 
question: Qcan he?Q  Can Obama? Billions of people believe that he 
can, and that is already an excellent start. 
 
The nationalist, Orthodox Makor Rishon-Hatzofe editorialized: QAs a 
whole we must turn to the ancient rule: QIf I am not for myself, who 
will be?Q  This is the lesson to be learned from the aftermath of 
the U.S. elections. 
 
Block Quotes: 
------------- 
 
Â¶I.  "The Dawn of a New Era" 
 
The independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz editorialized (11/6): QThe 
election of Barack Obama as president of the United States is a 
moving, historic event that inspires hope.... Obama was elected not 
only because of his good qualities, his personal charm and his 
verbal abilities.  He was chosen first and foremost because he 
represents, in the most acute and genuine way, the change for which 
the citizens of the United States so desperately yearn.... In an era 
when America became anathema in the world, and the Wall Street 
crisis dragged its people and many people all over the globe to the 
abyss of uncertainty and fear of the future, America chose the 
chance for peace and dialogue and socioeconomic repair in the spirit 
of the New Deal.... With his election, the deepest wound in American 
society, which was born with slavery but continued to bleed overtly 
and covertly in race riots and discrimination, has begun to heal. 
With Barack Obama's entry into the White House, the U.S., and 
together with it the entire world, stands on the threshold of a new 
era.  If Obama succeeds in fulfilling the hope that is pinned on 
him, the day of his election will go down as the day that wrought a 
change in the entire world, and will grant those living there a 
reason to look forward to the future with hope. 
 
II.  "Mazal tov, Obama" 
 
The conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized (11/6): 
QJust as the people of the United States were electing Barack 
Hussein Obama as their next president, Hamas was putting the 
finishing touches on a plot to abduct Israeli soldiers and break the 
relative cease-fire which has prevailed for the past five months.... 
Even as Hamas-controlled Gaza, fueled by religious fanaticism and 
mired in the culture of victimization, pursued its predictable 
violent trajectory -- 6,000 miles away, the splendor of peaceful 
change, representative democracy and political civility was on 
display for all to see. Those in our part of the world dedicated to 
rejectionism, violence, and terror will soon discover anew that the 
relationship between Washington and Jerusalem is above partisanship. 
 And the members of the new administration will see with their own 
eyes that no one wants peace more than Israel.  No one. 
Congratulations President-elect Obama on a historic victory. 
Godspeed. 
 
III.  "The Dawn of a New Middle East" 
 
Liberal columnist Yael Paz-Melamed wrote in the popular, pluralist 
Maariv (11/6): QWhen Israel pledged to vacate 26 unauthorized 
outposts and we did not even evacuate one of them, the friend from 
the White House [Bush] turned a blind eye.... A new wind will blow 
from the White House -Q not a hostile one, but a different one.  If 
[ObamaQs] advisers for the region are indeed people like Dan 
Kurtzer, Dennis Ross, or Martin Indyk, one can anticipate more 
proportionality towards Israel and its policy.  Those advisers, 
together with the powerful pro-Israeli lobby, in addition to 
pressure from the Pentagon, will certainly moderate American policy 
as Obama might perhaps have wanted to see it.  But there will be 
change anyway.  Apart from our politics, everything is changing, and 
the hope blowing from ObamaQs election is necessary for Israel, 
too. 
 
 
 
 
IV.  "Mr. World" 
 
Chief Economic Editor Sever Plotker wrote in the mass-circulation, 
pluralist Yediot Aharonot (11/6): QHumankind is united today like 
never before. Democracy, in all its various and not always perfect 
forms, is more common today than in the past.  When people describe 
their problems in terms of dreams and not in terms of wars, Barack 
Obama is viewed as the right man in the right place.  He crosses 
borders, religions, and races.  All the world is Obama.  And yet, 
the hard part is still in front of him.  Obama has never yet managed 
anything except his own lection campaign, and that is not much.  He 
is a American-style social democrat, who is getting Amrica in a 
condition of fear and trepidation -- astrong nation, but confused 
and expectant.... To win in the elections you have to know how to 
make promises.  To lead after the elections you have to know how to 
keep them.  The test of decisions is very different from the test of 
speeches.  ObamaQs electrifying election call, Qyes we can! 
becomes, for president-elect Obama a tough personal question: Qcan 
he?Q  Can Obama? Billions of people believe that he can, and that is 
already an excellent start. 
 
Â¶V.  QObama and Israel 
 
The nationalist, Orthodox Makor Rishon-Hatzofe editorialized (11/6): 
QLike in the past, Israel adopted a neutral approach to both 
candidates.... At this time, the Mideast policy of the elected 
Democratic candidate is unclear.   As his latest statements 
demonstrate, he might take steps that will lead to a rapprochement 
between Washington and Tehran, not between the U.S. and Syria.... At 
present it is IsraelQs duty to prepare anew and set its policy 
according to its interests to protect its well-being and the 
security of the state.  Not one will take of our security.  As a 
whole we must turn to the ancient rule: QIf I am not for myself, who 
will be?Q  This is the lesson to be learned from the aftermath of 
the U.S. elections.
