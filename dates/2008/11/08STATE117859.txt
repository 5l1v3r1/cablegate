SUBJECT: OSCE PERMANENT COUNCIL:  STATEMENT ON MOLDOVA 
 
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
 
We regret Transnistrian authorities' decision to deny 
President Voronin access to his home town of Corjova, in the 
Transnistrian region of Moldova. 
 
Incidents like this have the potential to undermine the 
environment for interactions between officials in Chisinau 
and Tiraspol, and show how easily a positive atmosphere can 
be spoiled.  We are reminded again that the path to 
negotiations and a lasting resolution will not be easy. 
 
Despite this, we look forward to the November 7-8 roundtable 
in Odessa and to the November 20-21 talks among the 3 plus 2 
mediators and observers in Vienna.  It is our hope that these 
events will clear the way for formal talks in the 5 plus 2 
format, and that all parties soon will return to the 
negotiating table to discuss the core issues of the conflict, 
including the definition of Transnistria's status within 
Moldova and the withdrawal of Russian forces from Moldova's 
territory.  A settlement respecting Moldova's independence, 
sovereignty, and territorial integrity must be the goal of 
all our efforts. 
 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
