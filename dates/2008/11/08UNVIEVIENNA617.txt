SUMMARY 
--------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Meeting in mid-November, UNODC Executive Director told 
Ambassador of the shocking level of amphetamine seizures in Saudi 
Arabia.  He expressed surprise at the difference between USG and 
UNODC estimates of poppy cultivation in Pakistan, predicted a 
decline in Afghanistan poppy cultivation in 2009, and proposed to 
conduct more frequent surveys on coca cultivation in Colombia.  He 
cited problems in counternarcotics efforts in Iran, and requested 
Ambassador's help for him to meet with CENTCOM Commander General 
Petraeus.  Costa and General Petraeus may meet in Europe during 
December 8-9.  End Summary.

Afghanistan 
------------ 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Costa stressed that reduction in poppy cultivation could 
not be sustained without improved security.  Asking missionoffs not 
to take notes, he shared with Ambassador the information that poppy 
cultivation and opium production would be down significantly in 
2009, based on preliminary planting surveys there.  He said he would 
disclose this information at the November 18 Friends of Afghanistan 
meeting.  (Note:  at the November 18 meeting, Costa stated that the 
level of poppy cultivation across Afghanistan would either hold (in 
the poppy-free provinces) or decline, with the greatest decline 
predicted for Helmand and the southern provinces, where such 
cultivation could fall by 20% in 2009. See Reftel.  (End Note.) 
 
--------------------- 
Drugs in Saudi Arabia 
--------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Costa began his November 12 meeting by informing 
Ambassador of his pending visit to Saudi Arabia, because he has been 
shocked by the consumption of amphetamines reflected in the large 
seizures of the chemical in the country.  He showed Ambassador a 
graph from UNODC's 2008 World Drug Report (page 176) which indicated 
seizure of 12.3 metric tons of amphetamines, generally marketed as 
Captagon, in Saudi Arabia in 2006.  Costa noted that that amount 
exceeded the combined total of such seizures in the U.S. (5.8 mt) 
and China (6.1 mt), and accounted for 28% of total world seizures. 
Costa said that Saudi Arabia and Iran have the worst addiction 
problems in the world. 
 
-------------- 
Pakistan Poppy 
-------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Ambassador gave Costa a copy of the letter from INL A/S 
David Johnson responding to Costa's earlier proposal to extend the 
Afghan opium survey to Pakistan.  Costa seemed surprised at the USG 
data that less than 2000 hectares in Pakistan were under poppy 
cultivation, or about 1% of the Afghan acreage.  Costa said that 
former Pakistan President Musharraf had indicated 8,000 hectares. 
 
--------- 
Colombia 
--------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  Costa told Ambassador that Colombia president Uribe was 
"disturbed" by UNODC's data on coca cultivation in his country. 
Costa noted that both USG and UNODC data, though different, point to 
the same downward trend in coca cultivation in Colombia.  To address 
Colombia's concerns, UNODC would propose to conduct more surveys 
throughout the year, as it does in Afghanistan.  In other words, 
UNODC would monitor/survey pre-planting intentions, planting and 
harvest data. 
 
---- 
Iran 
---- 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  He also noted that Iran was a problem for the UNODC 
because it needs and wants help in counternarcotics, but there is 
only "limited donor appetite" for assistance to Iran.  He asserted 
that Iran, directly or through Pakistan, absorbs/transships 70% of 
Afghanistan's opium export.  Strengthened border controls will not 
solve the problem as long as corruption and organized smuggling can 
circumvent these controls.  In his view, for others to help Iran, 
the government must first be willing to acknowledge that it has a 
problem with both drug addiction and official corruption that 
encourages the drug trade. 
 
------------------------- 
Briefing General Petraeus 
------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU)  Costa asked for Ambassador's help to brief CENTCOM 
Commander General Petraeus  on Afghanistan.  He said he would be 
willing to travel to Florida for a joint event with the General 
regarding the narcotics situation in Afghanistan. 
 
¶8.  (SBU)  (Note: We have since learned that General Petraeus agreed 
to a low-key meeting in Europe, where he plans to travel on December 
8 and 9.  Costa has prior plans to go to Brussels on those two days 
for an anti-corruption event with the European Commission.  It is 
possible that the two may meet in Brussels or elsewhere in Europe 
during those two days.  End Note.)
