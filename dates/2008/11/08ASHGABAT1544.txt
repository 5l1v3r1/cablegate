SUBJECT:  AMBASSADOR MANN: A WELCOME FIGURE IN TURKMEN STATE MEDIA - 
MEDIA REACION TO HIS RECENT VISIT 
 
¶1. (U) Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for public Internet. 
 
¶2.  (U) SUMMARY:  Turkmenistan's state media widely reported on U.S. 
Coordinator for Eurasian Energy Diplomacy Steven Mann's November 20 
meeting with President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov.  The same day, 
media sources accurately carried Mann's remarks from Turkmenistan's 
International Oil and Gas Conference (TIOGE) in which he emphasized 
opening Turkmenistan's energy market for foreign investment and 
partnership.  END SUMMARY. 
 
MEDIA HIGHLIGHT MANN'S MEETING WITH TURKMEN LEADER 
 
¶3.  (U) The November 20 "Watan" TV news program highlighted Mann's 
meeting with President Berdimuhamedov, praising bilateral relations 
with the United States.  The news story reported that both sides 
reaffirmed the mutually beneficial partnership between the two 
countries.  The story ended with an accurate translation of Mann's 
remarks to state media, following the meeting.  The same day "Owaz" 
radio channel's evening news program (Turkmen, Russian, English) 
carried a similar story on the meeting. 
 
¶4.  (U) The following day, stories appeared on the front pages of 
state-run dailies "Neytralniy Turkmenistan" (Russian, circ. 44,991) 
and "Turkmenistan" (Turkmen, circ. 33,391).  Articles were also 
posted on the government website "Turkmenistan Golden Age" (Turkmen, 
Russian, English) and on the Russia-based, pro-government website 
"Turkmenistan.ru" (Russian, English).  In subsequent days, most of 
the state weeklies reprinted a shorter version of the news story. 
 
ACCURATE COVERAGE OF MANN'S APPEARANCE AT TIOGE 
 
¶5.  (U) In rare, "double coverage" of a foreign visitor, the 
above-mentioned "Watan" TV news broadcast also included Mann's 
interview with a Watan correspondent taped on the margins of TIOGE. 
A "Reuters" November 20 news story accurately highlighted quotes 
from Mann's conference remarks, focused on his urging Turkmenistan 
to involve western companies and attract international partnership 
in developing the country's energy resources. 
 
¶6. (SBU) COMMENT:  Coverage of Steve Mann's visit naturally focused 
on discussions and cooperation in the energy sector, a safe topic 
for state media.  As all coverage is directed or heavily influenced 
by the president's office, the rare, double appearance of Mann on 
the evening news program was an indication of official support for 
cooperation with the United States in energy.  It might also be a 
sign of growing comfort with Ambassador Mann as an interlocutor, 
which is no small accomplishment given the importance that Turkmen 
attach to personal relationships.  END COMMENT.
