¶1.  (SBU) In coordination with the UK Embassy in Astana, we 
delivered reftel A points and non-paper on preventing Iran's 
acquisition of new supplies of uranium on November 21 to 
Sergey Savelyev, Deputy Director of the MFA's Department of 
Multilateral Cooperation.  We had previously delivered the 
same non-paper on September 2 (reftel B).  Savelyev expressed 
the Government of Kazakhstan's continuing support for strong 
non-proliferation efforts towards Tehran.  He promised to 
pass our non-paper to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral 
Resources (MEMR), which he said has the lead on this issue. 
Savelyev said he would report back to us any comments from 
MEMR.
