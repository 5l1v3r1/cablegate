Visits by the British Foreign Minister and the French Prime Minister 
to Beirut were given top billing in the Lebanese press.  Security 
investigations and the continuous pursuit of Fatah Al-Islam leaders 
were also underscored in headlines and front-page lead stories.  The 
press also highlighted the eighth report by the U.N. Secretary 
General on the implementation of UNSCR 1701.  A commentator noted 
that the French and British visits reflect "renewed" European 
interest in Lebanon as helping stability in the region.  The 
Europeans seem satisfied with the developments in Lebanon following 
the Doha Agreement, and are emphasizing the "positive Syrian role in 
these developments."  One editorialist noted that Lebanon should 
put, once and for all, an end to its fears of a deal at its expense 
between the international community and Syria.

------------Q 
 
"Miliband in Beirut:  Linkage Versus Divisions?" an editorial by 
Rafiq Khoury in centrist Al-Anwar (11/20): 
 
"...Miliband believes that the region's crises are interlinked and 
need a comprehensive solution.  He believes that the only way to 
solve the Palestinian conflict is to deal with it as part of a 
comprehensive solution that would also include the Iranian nuclear 
discord in addition to other issues.  Miliband used this same logic 
during his visit to Beirut when he noted that there will be no 
stability in the world without stability in the Middle East and no 
stability in the Middle East without stability in Lebanon.   ...In 
contrast, President (sic!) Obama, who will be facing unprecedented 
challenges,...has to think in a different way.  It is dangerous for 
the United States to insist on solving all crises together because 
this will lead to no solutions anywhere.  ...As for Beirut, the time 
has come to put a stop to all fears about possible deals with Syria 
at Lebanon's expense every time a European or an American official 
visits Syria or Iran.  ...Everyone is saying what Miliband said that 
'we have not lost our focus on Lebanon's importance,' and like Rice 
said, 'Washington is not prepared to make a deal at Lebanon's 
expense...'  What is important is that the Lebanese themselves play 
their role in building their state in order to protect Lebanon's 
future."
