ANTI-ISRAEL BIAS 
 
REF: STATE 123081 
 
(SBU) We delivered reftel demarche on November 24 to MFA 
Senior Counselor for International Organizations Petr 
Ilichev, urging Russia to vote "no" on UNGA resolutions with 
an anti-Israel bias.  Ilichev said that the GOR would 
continue its practice of abstaining on such votes.  He 
explained that although Russia preferred not to see UNGA 
resolutions that singled out specific countries, the GOR 
understood that the "difficult political and economic 
situation" faced by the Palestinian people inspired the 
drafting of these resolutions and would not oppose them.
