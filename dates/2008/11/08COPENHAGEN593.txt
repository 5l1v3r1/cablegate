(U) Poloff delivered reftel to Stephen Schoenemann, MFA's 
Asia and Latin America Department Section Head, on October 
Â¶22.  Schoenemann stated that Denmark places great emphasis on 
the upcoming elections in Afghanistan.  The Nordic countries, 
Denmark included, are cooperating closely on support for the 
elections and share a joint Nordic seat on the Steering 
Committee for the ELECT project.  Denmark's support to the 
UNDP ELECT program has been 3.7 million DKK (approx. 
$629,000) for the 2007-2008 period.  Denmark also provided 
some bilateral support to media organizations prior to and 
during the last elections.  Denmark's support to the upcoming 
elections has not been finalized.  However, the Danes 
anticipate approximately 20 million DKK (approx $3,400,000) 
for 2009-2010.  Denmark does not technically pool funding 
with other Nordic countries but it will regard the 
contribution as part of a joint Nordic contribution to the 
elections.
