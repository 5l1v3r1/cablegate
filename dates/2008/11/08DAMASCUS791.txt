¶1. Syrian papers dedicated their front-page headlines and editorials 
to President al-Asad's November 9 speech at the opening session of 
the Arab Transitional Parliament.  He called on the United States to 
pull its troops out of Iraq claiming, "The presence in Iraq of 
American occupation forces is a permanent threat to neighboring 
countries and an element of instability in the region."  All papers 
carried the speech's full text and the conference's final 
communiqu, which condemned the alleged U.S. attack in Abu Kamal 
describing it as "a flagrant violation of international law." 
¶2. Sada Souria, an unofficial sounding-board for the SARG, and Damas 
Post, a pro-SARG website, reported on FM Mouallem's interview with 
Qatar's Al-Sharq Newspaper.  FM Mouallem stated reopening the 
American School and the American Cultural Center depends on the new 
U.S. administration.  He said the new administration must adopt a 
"course that is completely different from the current U.S. 
administration's; a course that relies on a serious and objective 
dialogue with Syria.  Only then we will witness an improvement in 
Syrian-U.S. relations."  When asked about the Obama administration's 
role in the solving the Middle East crisis, he said "Obama's era 
will be different from Bush's era for one reason that the failure of 
Bush's domestic and foreign policies has caused Obama's victory." 
He expressed hope that achieving a just and comprehensive peace in 
the region will be one of Obama's priorities.  He said that "Arabs 
are ready for peace, but we must know Israel's intention on making 
peace."

¶6. Al-Ba'ath, "The Sublime Pan-Arab Voice" 
 
Shawkat Abu-Fakhr, an Al-Ba'ath commentator, wrote: "President 
Asad's speech was the sublime pan-Arab voice all over the Arab world 
in defending legitimate Arab rights and just Arab causes despite 
challenges and obstacles ....  President Asad's speech confirms the 
soundness of Syria's course despite the fierce and brutal campaigns 
of aggression and allegations in the last few years.  Syria did not 
lose the compass and still sticks to its pan-Arab and nationalist 
principles ....  No concessions on rights and no bargaining ....  As 
President Asad confirmed, it is no longer acceptable for Arabs to 
prove their readiness for peace as a strategic option while Israel 
continues to occupy Arab lands, dispel its inhabitants, and commit 
the ugliest massacres under the slogan of peace and security."
