PIPELINE 
 
REF: ANKARA 1914 
 
¶1.  (U)  SUMMARY.  Media report on the afternoon of November 5, 
a technical malfunction triggered a rupture in the Kirkuk-Ceyhan 
pipeline near the Bozova district of Sanliurfa province.  An MFA 
source told us the cause of the accident was technical, while a 
BOTAS official preferred to wait for the results of an ongoing 
investigation before commenting.  A former BOTAS official 
speculated these types of accidents may be the result of a 
strained budget situation at BOTAS (reftel).  According to 
reports, crude oil has seeped over an area of 5 kilometers, 
reaching the shores of the artificial lake created by the 
Ataturk Dam.  A local contact confirmed press reports that water 
had been cut off to residences in the affected areas, including 
Sanliurfa city.  END SUMMARY. 
¶2.  (SBU) Local press report at approximately 1530 on November 
5, residents of Yalintas village heard an explosion on the 
Kirkuk-Ceyhan pipeline.  (Note: This pipeline is operated by 
state-owned pipeline monopoly BOTAS and it carries Iraqi oil to 
the port of Ceyhan.  End note.)  Director of State Waterworks at 
the Ataturk Dam Gungor Gurkan confirmed online news that the 
burst was caused by an abrupt shift in pressure and not by 
sabotage or an act of terrorism. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) MFA Energy Department Head Berris Ekinci told us the 
GOT currently believes the cause of the accident was technical. 
The Deputy for Natural Gas and Petroleum Operations at BOTAS, 
Ruhi Aksoy, said BOTAS is currently investigating the accident 
and he declined to speculate on the cause before the team 
finishes its assessment. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Former BOTAS Department Head for International Affairs 
and current General Manager for E.ON Ruhrgas in Turkey, Dr. Cenk 
Pala also told us he believes the cause was technical.  Pala 
hypothesized that BOTAS's strained financial situation is taking 
its toll on the company.  GOT-owned enterprises owe BOTAS more 
than USD 8 billion (including interest) according to Pala. 
BOTAS is operating on a shoe-string budget and has not been able 
to provide the necessary training for staff or maintenance for 
pipelines.  Additionally, BOTAS is losing qualified staff to 
private companies. 
 
 
¶5.  (U)  Online images show heavy plumes of black smoke 
spiraling from a controlled fire set by local officials to 
prevent crude oil from further seeping into the already 
contaminated two-kilometers of river bed.  According to the 
press, fires are expected to burn for two days after which BOTAS 
Petroleum Pipeline Corporation, the pipeline's operating 
company, reportedly will require at least five days to assess 
and fix the damage. 
¶6.  (U)  While the environmental impact assessment is ongoing, 
Sanliurfa Human Rights Association Chairman Sedat Gozkiran told 
us the Ataturk Dam Irrigation Union reported a "serious amount" 
of oil had leaked into the reservoir and that residential water 
supplies had been shut off by the state.  Media report a 
30-kilometer oil slick now covers protected areas for the local 
softshell Euphrates turtle and fish population. 
¶7. (SBU)  Comment.  The Kirkuk-Ceyhan (also known as 
Kirkuk-Yumurtalik) pipeline, spanning over 1850 kilometers 
between Iraq and its ending point in the Mediterranean terminus 
in Turkey has experienced periodic sabotage over the past five 
years.  At this point, there is no reason to believe the 
accident was the result of sabotage.  The pipeline has been 
performing well this past year, with BOTAS reporting over 100 
million barrels flowing between January and September.  End 
comment.
