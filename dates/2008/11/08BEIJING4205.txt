  Editorial Quotes

¶1. G20 SUMMIT 
 
"G20 summit shows an equal, mutually beneficial and win-win 
relationship" 
 
The official intellectual publication Guangming Daily (Guangming 
Ribao) (11/13): "Both developed and developing countries have high 
expectations in the upcoming G20 summit.  Since its establishment, 
the G20 summit hasn't fulfilled its role. It has far less influence 
in economics and politics than the G8 group which tries to set 
universal standards and policy. The global financial crisis makes 
people reflect on what kind of international organization should 
dominate the World. In addition, the G8 group has not been 
institutionalized. Each meeting is called upon by the country that 
currently holds precedence; it rotates rather than follows a fixed 
schedule. Due to the emergence of the new economy, the G8 countries 
are not as strong and influential as they have been in the past. The 
financial crisis has taught rich countries that the World is no 
longer their private club. Therefore the G20 summit, which covers 
major industrialized countries and emerging economies, will play an 
active role in resolving international issues. China will 
participate in this summit with very strong cooperative intentions." 
 
 
¶2. FINANCIAL CRISIS 
 
 "The 'Market rescue' should first benefit the poor" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao) (11/13): "When people talk about the victims 
of the financial crisis they first think of the investments banks, 
former Wall Street executives, and the burning U.S. government. 
Actually the most directly and largely affected victims are the poor 
people who live at the lowest level of society. Because of the 
sub-prime mortgage crisis the poor people have lost one of their 
most basic rights, the right to shelter. The key to the success of 
Roosevelt's 'New Deal' was that it benefited the poor. No matter 
what 'market rescue' measures are being taken, they will not achieve 
what the policy makers wanted them to achieve; we wont save the 
economy unless we can make the poor believe that their savings, 
houses and jobs will not be affected."
