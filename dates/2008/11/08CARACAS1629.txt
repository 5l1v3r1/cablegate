¶1. (SBU) Economic Counselor was contacted November 26 by 
Nelson Dominguez of Venezuela's National Institute of Aquatic 
Spaces (INEA).  Dominguez identified himself as the head of 
INEA's maritime security unit and said he had been tasked by 
the President of INEA to meet with the Embassy to discuss our 
request for a Coast Guard port security visit.  We agreed to 
meet at 2:00 pm on Monday, December 1.  Economic Counselor 
will be accompanied by Coast Guard Attache Stephen Lesley. 
Dominguez volunteered that he had been involved in making the 
arrangements for the December 2004 visit of a Coast Guard 
International Port Security (IPS) Team; the report from that 
visit identified him as the Manager of INEA's Office of 
Systems Quality. 
 
¶2. (SBU) This call came after repeated Embassy attempts over 
the past six months to follow up with INEA on this issue.  We 
will report on the meeting outcome.
