¶1.  (U) The following is a weekly economic update for Ecuador that 
describes notable developments that are not reported by individual 
cables. 
 
Tariff Cuts for 49 Industrial Inputs 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (U) On October 30, Ecuador's Council on Foreign Trade and 
Investment (Comexi) approved a proposal to reduce tariffs to zero on 
49 industrial inputs and raw materials.  This is the eighth tariff 
reform since August 2007 (reftel).  The objective is to improve 
national production in the manufacturing, mining, textile, and 
cement sectors.  Products with tariff reductions include fuel for 
industrial engines; lubricant greases; alcohol sulfates, rubber 
waste; threads and cords of vulcanized rubber, and fabrics for towel 
manufacture, among others.  Under Secretary for Foreign Trade in the 
Ministry of Industries, Alexis Valencia, said that the reform would 
cost the GOE $6.7 million in lost tariff revenue. 
 
Effect of OPEC Production Cuts on Ecuador 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) Ecuador rejoined OPEC in October 2007.  In October 2008, OPEC 
decided to cut production given falling petroleum prices.  President 
Correa supported OPEC's decision in his weekly radio address October 
25, and said that Ecuador agreed to lower its quota from 520,000 
barrels per day (bpd) to 493,000 bpd.  Ecuador currently produces 
around 500,000 bpd between state oil company Petroecuador and 
private companies, and increasing production has been an 
administration priority. 
 
¶4.  (U) On November 10, Minister of Mines and Petroleum Derlis 
Palacios announced that Ecuador would ask OPEC for "special 
treatment" to maintain production if the group institutes additional 
production cuts, citing Ecuador's marginal producer status and the 
significant effect cuts would have on Ecuador's budget.  On November 
15, President Correa stressed that Ecuador would "respect and follow 
OPEC's decisions," while echoing the Minister's comments that 
Ecuador would seek exceptions because of its marginal status. 
 
Ecuador-Peru Trade Increased following Peace Accord 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶5. (U) At the Ecuador and Peru Integration Forum, celebrating the 
ten year peace agreement between these countries, Alfredo Davalos, 
Director of the Commercial Office at the Embassy of Ecuador in Lima, 
stated that trade between Peru and Ecuador had increased by over 
500% from 1998 to 2007.  Trade had increased from $300 million in 
1998 to $1.9 billion in December 2007.  Davalos said that trade was 
expected to reach $2.2 billion by the end of 2008.  Petroleum 
comprises 80 percent of Ecuadorian exports to Peru; other exports 
include wood products, tuna, shoes, and cleaning products.  Imports 
from Peru are largely petroleum derivative products and cleaning 
products.  Ecuador has a positive trade balance with Peru; last year 
Ecuador's exports to Peru were $1.5 billion, while Peru's exports to 
Ecuador were $400 million.
