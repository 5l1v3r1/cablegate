SUBJECT: TRAVEL WARNING - SOMALIA 
 
¶1. The State Department warns U.S. citizens of the 
risks of travel to Somalia and recommends that 
American citizens avoid all travel to Somalia. 
This replaces the Travel Warning dated October 24, 
2008 to note terrorist attacks in the regions of 
Somaliland and Puntland. 
 
¶2. The Department of State warns U.S. citizens 
against all travel to Somalia, including northern 
Somalia. On October 29, 2008, terrorists launched 
several coordinated and near-simultaneous 
attacks involving multiple car bombs against local 
and international targets in the regions of 
Somaliland and Puntland.  There is no U.S. Embassy 
or other U.S. diplomatic presence in Somalia. 
Consequently, the U.S. Government is not in a 
position to assist or effectively provide services 
to U.S. citizens in Somalia. 
 
¶3. Terrorist operatives and armed groups in 
Somalia have demonstrated their intent and 
capability to attack air operations at Mogadishu 
International Airport.  Kidnapping, murder, 
illegal roadblocks, banditry, and other violent 
incidents and threats to U.S. citizens and other 
foreigners can occur in many regions.  Inter-clan 
and inter-factional fighting flares up with little 
or no warning.  Unpredictable armed conflicts 
among rival militias are prevalent in southern 
Somalia, particularly in and around Mogadishu. 
This has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of 
Somali nationals and the displacement of nearly 
one million people.  In December 2006, Ethiopian 
military forces entered Somalia in support of the 
Somali Transitional Federal Government.  The 
continuing Ethiopian military presence and support 
for the Transitional Federal Government has 
heightened tensions among rival political and clan 
factions within Somalia. 
 
¶4. The Sanaag and Sool Regions in eastern 
Somaliland, bordering on Puntland (northeastern 
Somalia), are subject to insecurity due to ongoing 
border disputes and inter-clan fighting.  There 
also have been several fatal attacks and violent 
kidnappings against international relief workers, 
including Westerners, throughout Somalia, 
Somaliland, and Puntland.  Lines of control in 
Mogadishu are unclear and frequently shift, making 
movement within Mogadishu extremely hazardous. 
Violent riots have recently occurred in Mogadishu, 
as thousands of civilians protested rising food 
prices and the devaluation of the Somali currency. 
 
¶5. Recently, insurgents and extremist elements 
opposed to the Somali government conducted hit- 
and-run attacks on several towns in central and 
southern Somalia, to include the districts of Gedo 
and Bay (especially the vicinity of Baidoa) in the 
south. 
 
¶6. U.S. citizens also are urged to use extreme 
caution when sailing near the coast of Somalia. 
Merchant vessels, fishing boats, and recreational 
craft all risk seizure by pirates and having their 
crews held for ransom in the waters off the Horn 
of Africa, most especially in the international 
waters near Somalia.  There have been numerous 
such incidents, highlighting the continuing danger 
of maritime travel near the Horn of Africa.  If 
transit around the Horn of Africa is necessary, it

is strongly recommended that vessels travel in 
convoys, and maintain good communications contact 
at all times. 
 
¶7. U.S. citizens who travel to Somalia despite 
this Travel Warning are urged to register through 
the State Department's travel registration 
website, https://travelregistration.state.gov and 
obtain updated information on travel and security 
from the U.S. Embassies in neighboring countries. 
Travelers to the self-declared "Republic of 
Somaliland" should register with the U.S. Embassy 
in Djibouti, and travelers to Puntland or southern 
Somalia should register with the U.S. Embassy in 
Nairobi. 
 
¶8. The U.S. Embassy in Djibouti is located at 
Plateau du Serpent, Boulevard Marechal Joffre, 
Djibouti City; telephone (253) 35-39-95; after- 
hours telephone number (253) 35-13-43.  The 
mailing address is Ambassade Americaine, B.P. 185, 
Djibouti, Republique de Djibouti, and their 
workweek is Sunday through Thursday.  The U.S. 
Embassy in Nairobi is located on United Nations 
Avenue, Gigiri, Nairobi, Kenya; telephone 
(254)(20) 363-6000; after-hours emergencies 
(254)(20) 363-6170.  The mailing address is P.O. 
Box 606 Village Market 00621, Nairobi, Kenya. 
 
¶9. U.S. citizens should also consult the 
Department of State's Country Specific Information 
for Somalia and the Worldwide Caution, which are 
located on the Department's internet website at 
http://travel.state.gov.  Travelers may obtain up- 
to-date information on security conditions by 
calling 1-888-407-4747 toll-free in the U.S. or 
outside the U.S. and Canada on a regular toll line 
at 1-202-501-4444. 
 
¶10. Minimize considered.
