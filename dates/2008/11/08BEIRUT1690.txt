SUBJECT:  LEBANON:  STUDENT AND ASSOCIATION VOTES SPLIT BY MARCH 14 
AND OPPOSITION 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (U) Results of recent elections in several university student 
councils suggest that Lebanese society is divided between March 14 
and the opposition.  March 14, however, dominated recent 
professional association elections.  The outcomes of such elections 
generally are predicated on local circumstances and are not 
necessarily an accurate prediction of national trends. 
Nevertheless, observers watch the results closely and both sides use 
victory to support claims of popular support.  Moreover, a 
consistent set of victories for one side could boost its electoral 
prospects in the 2009 parliamentary elections given the Lebanese 
penchant for siding with winners.  End summary. 
 
STUDENT ELECTIONS SHOW SPLIT 
BETWEEN MARCH 14 AND OPPOSITION 
------------------------ 
 
¶2. (U) March 14 and the opposition each scored victories in several 
university student council elections that occurred in November. 
March 14 students did well in districts where the opposition won in 
the 2005 parliamentary elections, whereas opposition students 
prevailed in areas where March 14 MPs won in 2005.  However, this 
could be a reflection of the fact that many students are not from 
the districts where they attend university, rather than an 
indication of local unhappiness with incumbent parliamentarians. 
The students' own votes in the general election are not seen as 
significant, since few have reached the minimum voting age of 21. 
 
¶3. (U) On November 7, March 14 won a sweeping victory at Notre Dame 
University (NDU), winning 25 out of 30 seats to the opposition's 
five seats.   Located in the pre-dominantly Christian district of 
Kasrawan, where Michel Aoun's Free Patriotic Movement (FPM) 
currently holds all five parliamentary seats, this was the first 
time since 2005 that the FPM lost this annual student election. 
Similarly, March 14 won the November elections at Lebanese American 
University (LAU) in both its Beirut and Jbeil campuses.  In the 
pre-dominantly Sunni Muslim Beirut campus, March 14 won ten out of 
the 12 seats, and in the pre-dominantly Christian Jbeil (a district 
where the FPM currently holds all three parliamentary seats) campus, 
March 14 won eight out of the 12 student body seats. 
 
¶4. (U) The opposition had successes also. Candidates associated with 
Michel Aoun's FPM won six out of 11 seats in the elections at Saint 
Joseph University, located in the Christian Beirut neighborhood of 
Achrafieh.  The opposition (represented primarily by the FPM and 
Marada) won a sweeping victory in NDU's North Lebanon campus in 
Koura (where March 14 currently holds all three parliamentary 
seats). 
 
FEARS OF POLITICAL 
STRIFE PROMPT CANCELLATION 
OF LEBANESE UNIVERITY ELECTIONS 
----------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) At Lebanese University, the president announced the 
cancellation of all student council elections throughout LU campuses 
nationwide to avoid political tension.  Both March 14 and opposition 
youth associations condemned the decision and called for holding the 
elections.  In separate communiqus, Future Movement, FPM, and the 
Communist Party called the elections a student right and called on 
the president to retract his decision. 
 
INTRA-MARCH 14 POLITICS 
PLAY INTO AMERICAN UNIVERSITY 
OF BEIRUT ELECTIONS 
----------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Even at the student level, cooperation within the March 14 
coalition is a problem.  Walid Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist 
Party (PSP) issued a communiqu stating the PSP would not run in the 
November 26 elections at the prestigious American University of 
Beirut, but PSP students would vote for March 14 candidates. 
Minister of State Wael Abou Faour, complaining about the Future 
Movement's confessional approach to the elections, explained to 
Polstaff that this was to protest the Future Movement's attempt to 
limit the Druze community's representation based on the percentage 
of Druze students.  He warned that, without their own candidates, 
PSP students might not be motivated to vote, which could hurt March 
¶14.

MARCH 14 DOMINATES PROFESSIONAL 
ASSOCIATION ELECTIONS 
----------------- 
 
¶7. (U) On November 16, March 14 won three out of four seats up for 
election in the Beirut Bar Association.  The fourth and one 
alternate seats went to opposition FPM and Amal candidates, 
respectively.  March 14 also won a sweeping victory in the November 
23 Dentists' Association elections. 
 
¶8. (SBU) March 14 lost the presidency of the northern Bar 
Association to the opposition Marada candidate on November 2.  Many 
observers told us that this was because majority leader Saad Hariri 
insisted on presenting a Christian candidate from his Future 
Movement, rather than someone with better local "Christian" 
credentials, prompting a negative reaction from Christian voters. 
March 14 SYG Fares Souaid dubbed this a "miscalculation" on the part 
of March 14. 
 
¶9. (U) Meanwhile, Hizballah Labor Minister Mohammad Fneish postponed 
elections for the national teachers' union, originally scheduled for 
November 23, claiming voter lists had not been updated.  Many 
observers, however, believe fear of a March 14 victory was the real 
reason for the postponement.  The Labor Minister has authority over 
union elections. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶10. (SBU) Student and professional association elections occur 
throughout the year in Lebanon, and political parties invest 
considerable time and money trying to influence them.  While the 
results are debated intently as an indicator of national trends, in 
fact issues or circumstances within the association or university 
often are key factors.  However, with parliamentary elections just 
over the horizon, both March 14 and the opposition will point to 
their victories as evidence of their popular support.  Typical was 
March 14 stalwart MP Marwan Hamadeh's comment to Voice of Lebanon 
radio that the March 14 victory in Beirut bar association "reflected 
the upcoming Lebanese parliamentary elections."  Moreover, a 
consistent run of victories for one side could boost its electoral 
prospects in the 2009 parliamentary elections, given the Lebanese 
penchant for siding with winners.  So far, there is no sign of such 
a run.  End comment.
