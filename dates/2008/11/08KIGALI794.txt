President-Elect Barack Obama 
United States of America 
 
Dear President-Elect Barack Obama, 
 
It gives me great pleasure to convey to you, the Democratic Party, 
and the American people, on behalf of the Government and people of 
Rwanda, and on my own behalf, our most heartfelt congratulations on 
this historic occasion of your election as the 44th President of the 
United States of America. 
 
Your resounding success is clear demonstration of the confidence the 
American people have in your leadership to steer them into a more 
promising future. 
 
The implications of your election go beyond the United States of 
America to the rest of the world including Africa and Rwanda in 
particular, especially in these times of critical global challenges. 
 I have no doubt that there exists worldwide goodwill to address 
these difficulties that affect us all and take this opportunity to 
assure you of our commitment, as Rwanda, to play our part. 
 
We look forward to working with you and your administration to 
strengthen the existing excellent relations between our countries. 
 
Sincerely, 
/S/ 
Paul Kagame
