Santa Catarina State Governor, Luis Henrique da Silveira reported

has caused havoc in the state with destruction of highways, homes, 
plantations and human life.  He said that the floods are affecting 
1.5 million people and that the federal government is sending rescue 
teams, medicines and food supplies.

area, but there are no reports of casualities among the American

communications are limited. 
 
¶3.  (U) Mission Brazil has been in touch with Santa Catarina State 
Deputy Secretary for International Affairs, Celso Eduardo Flores to 
discuss an offer of disaster relief from USAID's Office of Disaster 
Assistance (OFDA).  The Deputy Secretary requested that we 
coordinate our response with their Director of Civil Protection, 
which we agreed.  He also understood that we would channel our 
funding via Caritas Brazil.  USAID has agreed to send a two person 
assessment team to the region to assess the situation.
