SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Sunni tribal sheikhs from across Salah-ad-Din (SaD) 
province staged a peaceful demonstration in support of the 
Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) on November 19 in downtown 
Tikrit.  The demonstration underscores the support of Sunni 
leaders in SaD for a continued U.S. presence, which they view 
as a guarantee of their security and political influence. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3. (SBU) On November 19, a variety of influential Sunni 
tribal leaders from across Salah-ad-Din province staged a 
peaceful demonstration in support of the SOFA.  The 
organizers of the protest included Sheikh Hamad Salim 
Al-Jabouri (Tikrit Sons of Iraq (SOI) leader), Khaled Falayeh 
As-Samarra'i (Samarra Sheikhs Council), and Sheikh Ahmad 
Rajib Al-Duleimi (Awakening Chairman Tikrit).  Sunni tribal 
representatives from Sharqat, Balad, Al-Dawr Samarra, and 
Bayji also participated in the demonstration. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The demonstration march started at 0900 local time 
at the Farmers Union Building in downtown Tikrit and 
proceeded to the Governorate Building.  According to PRT 
contacts, approximately 500 people participated in the 
demonstration. Protesters chanted slogans, such as "Na'am, 
na'am itifakiya amniya" ("yes, yes for the security 
agreement"). The protesters carried banners calling for the 
quick approval of the agreement by the Council of 
Representatives and affirming their support for Prime 
Minister Nuri Al-Maliki's efforts to conclude the agreement 
with the U.S. 
 
¶5. (SBU) COMMENT: The SaD Sunni tribal sheikhs view the U.S. 
presence in Iraq as a guarantee of their security and 
influence and support the SOFA for that reason.  The prospect 
of a premature U.S. withdrawal is of special concern for SOI 
and other leaders who have supported CF.  END COMMENT.
