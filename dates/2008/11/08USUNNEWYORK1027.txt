REMEMBRANCE 
 
¶1.  Summary:  Iran was recalcitrant in the November 3 UN 
General Assembly (UNGA) debate in reaction to U.S. remarks on 
Iran's denial of the Holocaust, and complained generally of a 
UN conspiracy.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  Citing the lessons of the Holocaust, U.S. Public Delegate 
Cheryl Halpern commended UN efforts to memorialize the 
victims and confront the threat of genocide in our day. 
Halpern called Iran to account for Holocaust denial, which is 
"unacceptable and unconscionable."  Full USDel remarks are 
available at the Mission's web site, 
www.usunnewyork.usmission.gov. 
 
¶3.  After scheduled speakers concluded, Iran exercised the 
right of reply and attempted to defend against a 
"disinformation campaign" of "baseless and absurd distortions 
against Iran" organized in "certain circles" to "please a 
political group."  Conceding "there is no justification for 
genocide," the Iranian said that the "Israeli regime" cannot 
exploit "past crimes as a pretext for new crimes."  Video is 
available at www.un.org/webcast, search November 3. 
 
¶4.  The other speakers' remarks were supportive of the SYG's 
report under consideration.  The Israeli PermRep expressed 
appreciation for the UN's outreach and turned her remarks to 
adapting "the lessons of Nazi genocide to the evolving 
threats of our time."  She highlighted the Iranian call for 
Israel's destruction and denial of "the historical realities 
of the Holocaust."  The Russian representative said that any 
attempt to whitewash history is unacceptable and called for 
vigilance against racism, discrimination and xenophobia.  The 
French PermRep then reaffirmed the EU's commitment to combat 
anti-Semitism, racism, and "all forms of political, ethnic or 
religious intolerance."  Austrian, Canadian and Australian 
representatives echoed these themes and detailed their 
nation's efforts to memorialize the Holocaust and prevent 
discrimination.  The Rwandan representative condemned social 
attitudes that lead to genocide. 
 
¶5.  The SYG's report "Program of Outreach on the 'Holocaust 
and the UN'" (A/63/316) outlined UN collaboration with a 
network of civic and academic leaders in seminars, 
exhibitions, scholarly papers, panel discussions, films, 
online products, and the observance of the January 27 as the 
International Day of Commemoration.  The outreach program has 
publicized survivors' accounts and continues to warn of the 
consequences of discrimination.
