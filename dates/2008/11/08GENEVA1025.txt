                                   Official Translation 
                                   November 21, 2008 
 
Statement by the Representative of the Russian Federation 
to the Joint Compliance and Inspection Commission 
for the Treaty on the Reduction 
and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms 
 
      On November 17, 2008, Representatives of the Republic 
of Belarus, the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Russian 
Federation, Ukraine, and the United States of America met in 
Geneva, Switzerland, to consider whether the Treaty Between 
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States 
of America on the Reduction and Limitation of Strategic 
Offensive Arms (START) will be extended, as provided for in 
paragraph 2 of Article XVII of the Treaty. 
 
      Therefore, the requirement of the Treaty to meet on 
this issue before December 5, 2008, is fulfilled.  In this 
connection, the Parties desire to emphasize that there is no 
Treaty requirement to make a decision to extend the Treaty at 
this meeting. 
 
      The Republic of Belarus, the Republic of Kazakhstan, 
the Russian Federation, Ukraine, and the United States of 
America will continue to discuss the issue, noting that a 
decision on this issue can be made up until expiration of the 
Treaty on December 5, 2009.
