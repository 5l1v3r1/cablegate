¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: In response to reftel points, the Brazilian 
National Telecommunications Agency (ANATEL) raised concerns that 
consolidating working party activities could diminish focus on 
international mobile telecommunications work.  ANATEL looks forward 
to discussing these issues further with USG in Geneva this week. END 
SUMMARY 
 
¶2. (SBU) On November 6, 2008 Econoff delivered reftel demarche to 
the Brazilian National Telecommunications Agency (ANATEL). Mr. 
Marcos de Souza Oliveira, ANATEL's manager of spectrum engineering, 
received the document regarding the department's compromise proposal 
of restructuring the study groups within the International 
Telecommunication Union- Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) Study 
Group (SG) 5 that will be discussed at the ITU-R meeting in Geneva, 
Switzerland November 10-11. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) While Oliveira applauded the U.S. compromise  reversing 
its previous position to eliminate working party (WP) 5D within the 
SG 5 and instead proposing to transfer only the sub working group 
spectrum sharing aspect from WP 5D to WP 5A, Oliveira voiced 
concerns about potentially diminishing WP 5D's important work in 
International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT), arguing for a 
continued separation between WP 5D's IMT studies and WP 5A's land 
mobile services work. Oliveira rejected the U.S. opinion that 
inevitable convergences between IMT and general land mobile service 
technologies warranted this change, arguing instead that IMT issues, 
as a direct by-product of increased globalization, should continue 
to have its own forum within ITU-R's SG 5 and said proposals should 
not be solely inspired by cost cutting measures, as Oliveira 
suggested this proposal was. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Oliveira expressed appreciation for continued U.S. efforts 
to streamline ITU-R WP structures and would welcome future U.S. 
proposals. He also noted that Mario Antonio Tavares, ANATEL's 
representative for the ITU meeting in Geneva this week, looks 
forward to meeting with Ambassador Gross to discuss this and other 
telecommunication related issues.
