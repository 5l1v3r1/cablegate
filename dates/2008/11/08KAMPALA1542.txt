REF: STATE 123081 
 
¶1.  PolOff delivered reftel points to Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs Multilateral Organizations and Treaties Office 
Director Isaac Sebulime on November 20, calling on Uganda to 
vote against or at a minimum abstain on unhelpful and 
disproportionate resolutions against Israel.  Sebulime said 
that the GOU recognized that the Israel-Palestine issue was 
"politicized" within the UN, but noted that it was a problem 
created by the UN and therefore viewed by many in the 
international community as the place to solve it.  In the 
end, Sebulime said that the GOU would review past resolutions 
and consider the USG position accordingly. 
 
¶2.  Comment: As noted in reftel, Uganda in the past has had a 
mixed record in supporting the U.S. position on anti-Israeli 
resolutions.  Barring imminent changes in key positions at 
the Foreign Ministry or at the Ugandan Mission to the UN, we 
do not expect any substantial shifts in GOU voting patterns 
towards Israel or Palestine.
