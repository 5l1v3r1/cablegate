Main Stories: 
------------- 
 
Al Quds leads with reports on preparations for the Palestinian 
dialogue in Cairo, revealing that Hamas has demanded several 
amendments to the Egyptian paper for Palestinian reconciliation. 
These include clarification on Palestinian Authority (PA) 
President's term in office and his powers to negotiate with Israel. 
 
 
The three papers front-page comments made by President Abbas during 
his November 2 meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah that no peace 
agreement would be signed this year and that the PA will not sign 
any incomplete agreement with Israel.  All papers report that Abbas 
and Ahmed Qurei'ya will attend the Middle East Quartet meeting in 
Egypt, to be held on November 9. 
 
Al Ayyam and Al Hayat Al Jadida lead with news that Israeli security 
officials have warned of the possibility of political assassinations 
of Israeli leaders by right-wing Israelis intent on sabotaging a 
peace agreement with Palestinians.  The warning is based on calls 
for violence by Israeli settlers.  Al Quds reports on its front page 
that the Israeli government has decided to stop funding for 
settlement outposts in the West Bank in response to increased 
settler violence against the Israeli military. 
 
Al Quds carries an article from the Israeli Haaretz newspaper 
stating that Israel's Defense Minister Ehud Barak favors finalizing 
a prisoners swap agreement with the PA before the end of this year. 
According to the report, Barak fears an internal Palestinian crisis 
that would hinder negotiations when Abbas's term in office ends. 
 
All papers carry a report that the Arab League condemned Israeli 
"aggression" and poor treatment of Palestinians and the destruction 
of an Islamic graveyard in Jerusalem.  In related reporting, all 
papers report on Palestinian protests over closures in Hebron and 
carry photographs of Palestinian children facing Israeli soldiers on 
November 2 in a public protest to lift the Israeli closure on the 
West Bank city of Hebron.  On its inside pages, Al Quds reports that 
Israel is preventing Palestinian doctors from entering Jerusalem to 
work at their clinics. 
 
Al Ayyam reports on its front page that Saudi security averted a 
terrorist attack on Los Angeles when they arrested Al Qaeda leader 
Ali Faqisi, also known as Abu Bakr. 
 
In coverage of the U.S. presidential election, Al Quds reports on 
its front page that a recent CNN poll shows Obama leading 7 points 
over McCain in the US elections and publishes a proposed lists of 
nominees in a potential Obama administration.  The list names Robert 
Zoellick as Secretary of State.  Al Hayat Al Jadida's front page 
reports that Americans fear an elections system shutdown due to 
heavy voter turnout, citing a desire to avoid a repeat of the 2000 
elections. 
 
All papers report on a poll by Alpha International that 73 percent 
of Palestinians living in the Palestinian Territories support the 
dissolution of the Palestinian Legislative Council and new 
parliamentary elections in 2009.  If elections were held today, 48 
percent would vote for Fatah and 12 percent for Hamas.  Liekwise, 52 
percent support holding new presidential elections and 52 percent 
support negotiations with Israel. On ending the Palestinian-Israeli 
conflict, 56 percent said that this could be accomplished through

negotiations and 29 percent said its needs armed struggle.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------ 
 
1)  In its main editorial "UN Responsibilty", Al Quds comments on 
statements by Robert Serry, U.N. Middle East envoy, on the 
demolition of Palestinian houses.  It says: "with respect to the 
stand expressed by the UN envoy on the [Israeli] house demolition 
policy......it is time for the UN to work in cooperation with the 
international community to implement thesQpositions and implement 
the international legitimacy relevant to the Palestinian issue, so 
that the UN role won't remain confined to the humanitarian role or 
to simple criticism." 
 
2)  Columnist Hasan Al Batal editorializes in Al Ayyam under the 
title "Time for an American change" that "if this young black man 
[Obama] wins, despite demonization campaigns against him, the 
American voter will finally be matured and select 'change' in 
America after the [rest] of the world has changed.  The first black 
American for President and the first Presidential female candidate 
and the first female Vice Presidential candidate, this is the 
beginning of change ... It's not important in which direction the 
wind of change will blow as winds usually change [direction]." 
 
3) Columnist Talal Okal opines in Al Ayyam under the title "This 
interest is strange" that the Arab media interest in the US 
elections is odd.  He asks: "Is there a change that we expect and 
don't know, that can result from the victory of the Democratic 
Barack Obama to replace George Bush the Republican?.....by 
examination, we might not find any change except personal qualities 
of the president, as Obama might add a human touch; as done by 
Clinton eight years ago, but with no substantial change in 
policies."
