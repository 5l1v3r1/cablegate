REF: STATE 116174 
 
(U) Post has been unable to confirm the bona fides of reftel 
entities.  Officials at the end-user Russian Ministry of Atomic 
Energy (RosAtom) declined to provide us with information regarding 
this case.  They also claimed to not know the reftel point of 
contact, Aleksandr Starostin.  ESTOff contacted his interlocutors at 
RosAtom as well, but was also unsuccessful in obtaining any 
information.  Officials at foreign consignees JSC Instrument Plant 
Tenzor and the Novovoronezh Nuclear Power Plant would not speak with 
us without permission from RosAtom, which as previously indicated 
was not forthcoming.
