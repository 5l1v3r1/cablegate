(SBU) PolChief passed reftel points to MFA's Director of 
International Organizations Yacub al-Hosani on November 24 with a 
reminder that the UN needs to maintain a balanced role in moving the 
Israeli-Palestinian dispute towards a positive conclusion. 
Emphasizing that the UN must avoid the bias represented in the 
resolutions listed reftel, PolChief expressed concern that the UAEG 
had often voted in support of them.  Al-Hosani noted the concern, yet 
added that sometimes these resolutions were deemed the only way to 
keep the Palestinian plight from being forgotten.
