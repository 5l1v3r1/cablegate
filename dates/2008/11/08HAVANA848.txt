REF: STATE 114666 
 
¶1.  Post's Emergency Action Committee (EAC) met on 
October 27, 2008, to discuss security planning 
for an Election Night event at the Chief of 
Mission residence on November 4, 2008. 
Approximately 150 guests are expected and USINT 
will employ a variety of physical and technical 
countermeasures to ensure the security of all 
attendees. 
 
¶2.  Based on current threat information, host 
country vigilance, and the utilization of USINT 
security assets, the EAC is confident that 
security planning for Election Night meets Post's 
needs.
