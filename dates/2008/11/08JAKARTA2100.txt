SUBJECT: INDONESIA - NOVEMBER 14 AVIAN INFLUENZA UPDATE 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary.  Indonesia's media has alarmed international 
press with reports of 17 likely hospitalized bird flu cases in 
Makassar, but health experts are suggesting that these are more 
likely cases of mild influenza-like illness (ILI) and pneumonia. 
The Makassar hospital has sent samples to the National Institute of 
Health Research and Development (NIHRD) for analysis.  NIHRD 
anticipates releasing results in two days.  According to the Jakarta 
office of the World Health Organization (WHO) NIHRD did confirm 
another new case of avian influenza on November 12, but the Ministry 
of Health has not officially announced the result for posting on the 
WHO website.  Minister of Health Siti Fadilah Supari traveled to the 
United States on November 12 to be a featured speaker at the Seventh 
International Bird Flu Summit in Las Vegas, Nevada.  Supari's 
ministry funded television show "enters its third rerun season.  USG 
agencies report on latest activities. End Summary.

Makassar Cases and New H5N1 Death 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Indonesia media has released reports that up to 17 patients 
have been hospitalized in Makassar with suspected bird flu.  The 
media reports that preliminary rapid tests have confirmed H5N1 and 
that poultry has been dying in the area.  Sources within the World 
Health Organization (WHO), Ministry of Health (MOH) and the district 
are advising that rapid tests may have been done on some patients 
for influenza A, and not H5N1.  Only two of the 17 patients appear 
to be experiencing fever at this time.  Officials are speculating 
that these cases appear to resemble influenza-like illness and not 
H5N1, with several cases being pneumonia.  The Makassar hospital has 
sent samples for all patients to NIHRD for testing.  NIHRD 
anticipates releasing results in two days.   Participatory 
Disease/Response personnel in the area are culling fowl and 
monitoring the situation closely. 
 
¶3. (SBU) According to WHO sources, NIHRD confirmed on November 12, a 
new fatal case of H5N1 from samples of a 15 year-old girl from 
Semarang, Central Java.   The girl died after four days of 
hospitalization in Semarang.  Although the Ministry of Health has 
yet to announce the case publically for inclusion on the World 
Health Organization website, MOH officials immediately notified the 
WHO Jakarta office.  However, press reports that Minister Supari is 
publicly denying the case stating "Both of the laboratory tests 
showed that she was negative of bird flu, so the total death toll 
(of bird flu) remains 112."

Supari in Vegas and on TV 
-------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) Minister Supari traveled to Las Vegas on November 12 to 
deliver a keynote address at the 7th International Bird Flu Summit. 
The conference will take place on November 13 - 14, 2008, at the 
Monte Carlo Resort and Casino Hotel, in South Las Vegas, Nevada. 
 
¶5. (U) Minister Supari's television program "Chitchatting with Madam 
Minister" has entered its third season of reruns.  Started in June 
2007, the show provides 13 episodes, all featuring Minister Supari 
interacting with a live audience of housewives, students, or youth 
groups.  Each episode runs approximately one hour and aims at 
educating the general public about health policies on such topics as 
 health insurance for the uninsured, health for hajj pilgrims, 
sample sharing, heart disease, asthma, and infectious diseases. 
 
¶6. (SBU) According to sources, MOH public outreach funds have 
financed the series, with production costs running at $50,000 per 
show. The show was conceived as a way to combat negative publicity 
that the Minister was receiving in early 2007.  Each show follows a 
standard format that includes Minister Supari interacting with 
expert guests (usually Director Generals from the MOH), followed by 
a question and answer session, a quiz, and ending with entertainment 
such as singing or dancing performed by the audience.

¶7.  (U) The USAID funded Community Based Avian Influenza Control 
 
JAKARTA 00002100  002 OF 002 
 
 
(CBAIC) Project is developing key messages for use by mass media and 
stakeholders following a series of discussions from technical 
partners and Indonesian officials.  USAID and the United Nations 
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) plan to conduct a 
decontamination campaign at key points in the poultry production and 
marketing chain to minimize the spread of AI virus by the end of the 
year. 
 
¶8.  (U) Approximately twenty Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) 
auditors/inspectors completed a one week APHIS funded training 
course to assess biosecurity status of commercial poultry farms. 
Participating farms passing inspection receive "AI-free" 
certificates good for two years issued by the MOA.  APHIS also plans 
to begin market interventions such as perimeter control in slaughter 
houses and markets.

Human Health Activities 
----------------------- 
 
¶9.  (SBU) CDC along with WHO and MOH are in the process of 
implementing an early warning system for early outbreak detection 
and response in Lampung province, Sumatra.  The program will 
expanded to Bali and Sulawesi provinces over the next six months. 
CDC and WHO continue to work with the MOH on a follow-up simulation 
exercise for epicenter containment in Sulawesi province in February 
¶2009. The scenario will be different from the Bali exercise earlier 
in the year and will emphasize testing operational guidelines in an 
urban environment. 
 
¶10.  (SBU) NIHRD is finalizing documentation for renewal of its 
cooperative agreement with CDC- Atlanta.  NIHRD will use funds to 
support influenza testing for patients with influenza-like illness 
in a network of primary health care centers and patients with severe 
acute respiratory illness in a network of eight hospitals.  CDC 
awarded funds to NIHRD through the REDI Center to conduct a 
prospective cohort study of approximately 600 high risk (for H5N1 
exposure) poultry workers from Tangerang municipality to begin in 
January 2009.
