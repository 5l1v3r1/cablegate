SUBJECT: EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOL IN CANADA 
 
REF: STATE 92121 
 
¶1. (U) Summary: Canada's emergency telecom systems consist of 
a priority access for dialing (also known as priority access 
to dial tone or PAD) system for landline phones and a 
wireless priority system (WPS) similar to the U.S. model. 
The dated PAD system offers little benefit to the Embassy. 
However, the GOC would welcome Mission Canada's participation 
in the WPS. End Summary. 
 
LANDLINE PRIORITY 
----------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Reftel requested information regarding potential 
means for post to communicate locally and with Washington in 
case of emergency and/or severe network overload.  Christine 
Volonte, Project Officer, National Emergency Telecom 
Services, Industry Canada, told emboffs that Canada does not 
have an emergency "end-to-end" priority service for landline 
calls on par with the U.S Government Emergency Telecom 
Service (GETS).  Canada's emergency system provides Canadian 
federal, provincial, and municipal officials only with 
priority access to dial tone (PAD).  Volonte noted that the 
Canadian and U.S. telecom systems are well integrated and use 
the same switching and routing.  As a result, many Canadian 
officials, herself included, have U.S. GETS cards that give 
them access to the U.S. GETS system as long as they can get a 
call through to a U.S. system. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Canadian PAD system is not compatible with voice 
over internet protocol (VOIP), which is already used by 
several Canadian municipalities, including Vancouver, the 
host of the 2010 Olympics, Volonte said.  She stated that the 
technology needed to prioritize certain VOIP data packets 
(particularly end-to-end) does not yet exist. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Volonte believes that the Canadian PAD system would 
not be beneficial to post.  She said even in times of severe 
stress on the Canadian telecom system, the Embassy's own 
communications arrangements would likely allow Embassy 
officials to obtain a dial tone due to the fact that we host 
our own PBX system and have digital (T-1) lines. 
Furthermore, she expects that the PAD system will eventually 
be phased out. 
 
WIRELESS PRIORITY 
----------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Canada's wireless priority service (WPS), according 
to Volonte, is identical to the WPS in the United States. 
The Canadian WPS does not offer end-to-end priority, but 
rather helps prioritize phone to cell tower communication 
during emergencies.  The system is two years old, has less 
than 1,000 subscribers, and is maintained by Rogers Wireless, 
a private company.  A second company, MTS Allstream, has 
requested and been approved to offer WPS because they provide 
Canada-wide telecom services but have not yet offered the WPS 
service to customers.  All domestic officials wishing to 
subscribe to WPS must apply through Industry Canada, and 
foreign officials must apply through the Department of 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade.  WPS in Canada has 
issues identical to WPS in the United States regarding the 
use of 3G (HSPA) handsets and at this point in time 2G phones 
should be used to ensure access to WPS. 
 
¶5. (U) Within the WPS, subscribers are separated into five 
levels of priority: 
 
Level 1: Executive Leadership and Decision Makers 
Level 2: Disaster Response and Military Command and Control 
Level 3: Public Health and Safety and Law Enforcement Command 
Level 4: Public Service, Utilities, and Public Welfare 
QLevel 4: Public Service, Utilities, and Public Welfare 
Level 5: Disaster Recovery 
 
¶6. (SBU) Mission Canada officials, should they subscribe to 
WPS, would be assigned priority level 2.  The subscription 
costs 10 CAD/month/phone and 1 CAD per minute of use.
