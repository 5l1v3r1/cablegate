¶1.  (SBU) Vladan Lazovic, First Secretary with the MFA Human Rights 
Directorate, told PolOff on November 21 that Serbia likely will 
abstain on the UNGA resolutions reaffirming the existence and 
activities of three UN bodies that promote a culture of bias against 
Israel (reftel). 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Lazovic said that he did not anticipate that Serbia, which 
abstained or was absent on all three votes in 2007, would change its 
position.  Lazovic said Serbia would align itself with the stance 
adopted by the European Union, noting that many EU countries 
abstained or were absent during 2007 voting on the three 
resolutions.
