Poloff reported information requested by reftel to Peter 
Huber, MFA Director of the Department for International 
Organizations.  Huber told Poloff the demarche on 
anti-Israeli resolutions was an "annual ritual between our 
governments," and commented that the GOA has little control 
over the volume of anti-Israeli resolutions.  He expressed 
his belief that the number of UNGA resolutions was in part a 
reflection of frustration by member states at the lack of 
progress in the Security Council.  He said the GOA will 
review each UNGA resolution on a case-by-case basis before 
making a voting decision.  However, the GOA considered these 
resolutions as part of the Middle East peace process, and 
when the GOA believed voting for a resolution could advance, 
or at least not damage, this process they would vote for it. 
On resolutions reaffirming the three UN bodies, he remarked 
that the GOA will consult with its EU partners on how to 
vote. (Note: In the 62nd UNGA the GOA abstained on 
resolutions 62/80 and 82/81, and voted yes on 62/106. End 
note)
