SUBJECT: Chavez - Sao Paulo Media Reaction 
 
Title- Chavez' second defeat 
 
Main editorial in center-right O Estado de S.Paulo (11-26) states: 
"The regional elections held on Sunday in Venezuela pushed t 
'chavismo' to the outskirts of the country and defeated the myth 
that the poor are the pledged voters of the caudillo....  The most 
concrete effect of the rejection to Chavez-whose 'great 
accomplishments,' which influenced the vote, include a shortage of 
staple goods, 30%-inflation and crime running rampant, especially in 
Caracas-is the strengthening of the resistance to his plans to 
perpetuate himself in power.... The disfigured opposition of years 
past has rebuilt itself and has promised to challenge [Chavez] in a 
united way during the 2009 congressional elections, public opinion 
seems reinvigorated-and the source of power that exuded from oil at 
more than USD100.00 has vanished." 
 
Title- Elections show erosion of Chavez' popularity 
 
Editorial in business-oriented Valor Econtmico (11-26) says: "The 
state and municipal elections last Sunday gave [Chavez] an 
uncontested victory based on the number of votes his allies obtained 
and on the number of states where they continued in power.... [But] 
the opposition once more galvanized the support of part of the 
middle class that opposes Chavez, but what is significant is that it 
deteriorated Chavez' traditional support base.... Chavez' political 
power tends to erode even more because the good days of absurd oil 
revenues are over.... Chavez has not given up and may once more try 
to change the Constitution in order to get reelected.... Now that 
the opposition is more engaged, the president will have two options. 
He can either work with [the opposition] or become more radical, as 
has been his style. If he chooses the last option, the consequences 
are unpredictable."
