REF: A. OCTOBER 31 WRIGHT-SILBERBERG EMAIL 
     ¶B. STATE 116705 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  The Forum for Security Cooperation on 
November 12 adopted decisions for an information exchange on 
end-user certificates, endorsement of a guide to disposition 
of melange (rocket fuel oxidizer), and the forwarding of a 
draft Ministerial Council decision on small arms, light 
weapons, and stockpiles of conventional ammunition (SALW/SCA) 
to the Ministerial Council.  The impasse continues over the 
companion Ministerial draft decision on other FSC issues as 
Georgia and Russia cannot agree how to describe the autumn 
round Security Dialogue discussions of their conflict in 
August.  Estonia welcomed initial comments on the draft 
agenda for the March 2009 cyber security workshop.  Russia 
opposes expanding the work of implementing UNSCR 1540 at the 
OSCE to the Security Committee/Permanent Council, preferring 
to keep it in the FSC and avoid "too many cooks."  End 
summary. 
 
Defense Planning Deadline 
------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) In the November 12 FSC working group, Sweden (Byren) 
announced it supported the Russian proposal for a single 
deadline for submission of defense planning information 
(FSC.DEL/494/07/Rev.3/Corr.1) as it would "strengthen 
implementation of the Vienna Document."  Russia (Ulyanov) 
said there was near consensus and called on delegations that 
were not prepared to endorse the proposal to say so. 
Azerbaijan reported it lacked final guidance.  The U.S. 
reminded that it opposed the proposal.  Germany (Schweizer) 
reported it would have difficulty in predicting by what date 
its defense budget data would be available for submission, 
although in principle it wants to support the proposal. 
 
End-User Certificates 
--------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) The working group endorsed, and the plenary 
subsequently adopted without comment, the draft decision for 
an information exchange on end-user certificates 
(FSC.DD.9/08/Rev.3). 
 
Melange Overview 
---------------- 
¶4. (SBU) The working group also endorsed, and the plenary 
subsequently adopted without comment, the draft decision 
(FSC.DD/13/08/Corr.1) welcoming the "overview" of disposal of 
melange (rocket fuel oxidizer) (FSC.DEL/443/07/Rev.2). 
 
Code of Conduct Questionnaire 
----------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Belarus (Pavlov) proposed adding a reference to the 
Helsinki Final Act in the preamble to the draft decision for 
an update of the Code of Conduct Questionnaire 
(FSC.DD/14/08).  Switzerland supported Belarus.  Germany 
(Schweizer) asked whether Belarus could then support the 
entire document.  Pavlov said he still needed final 
instructions but doubted Belarus would block consensus. 
Latvia (Nilsons) recommended combining draft Questionnaire 
sections I.3.1. and I.3.2., on the implementation of "other 
 
USOSCE 00000274  002 OF 004 
 
 
international commitments," as they appeared redundant. 
Russia objected, insisting that the first section addressed 
current commitments while the second concerned future ones. 
Germany still lacks final instructions, although signals from 
Berlin are "increasingly positive." 
 
SALW MC.DD 
---------- 
¶6. (SBU) The working group and plenary endorsed the draft 
Ministerial Council decision (MC.DD/7/08/Rev.3) welcoming 
work done by the FSC in 2008 on SALW/SCA and requesting for 
2009, inter alia, a review of the OSCE Document on SALW, 
establishment of national legal frameworks for the control on 
SALW brokering, and national efforts to adopt an 
international tracing instrument for SALW. 
 
¶7. (SBU) The working group also endorsed a draft decision 
that was later adopted by the plenary transmitting the SALW 
draft decision to the Ministerial Council for its approval in 
December (FSC.DD/15/08).  USDEL Silberberg discussed with the 
Secretariat and CiO its intention to make an interpretive 
statement if the SALW is adopted at the Ministerial.  The 
Secretariat recommended informing the chair at the 
Ministerial plenary of U.S. intentions well in advance of 
consideration of the draft decision. 
 
FSC Issues MC.DD 
---------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) During negotiation of the draft Ministerial Council 
decision on FSC issues (MC.DD/6/08/Rev.3), Russia agreed ad 
ref to the language in OP1 tic 2 describing the Security 
Dialogue on the Georgia-Russia war as the "dialogue . . . 
addressing the armed conflict in August 2008."  Georgia has 
requested further instructions but for the time being could 
not agree to this language.  Russia also now supports the 
German compromise version of OP3 on progress reports ("These 
reports should include . . . and other areas, as 
appropriate.").  The chair has issued a revised version 
(MC.DD/6/08/Rev.4) with only the German OP3 and encouraged 
Russia and Georgia to resolve their differences over OP1. 
 
FSC Chair's Letter 
------------------ 
 
¶9. (SBU) There was no discussion of the FSC Chair's Letter 
(MC.GAL/7/08).  The chair announced his intent to forward the 
letter to the Ministerial Council by November 26. 
 
Cyber Security 
-------------- 
¶10. (SBU) Estonia (Tiigimae) solicited comments on the draft 
agenda and modalities for the March 2009 cyber security 
workshop (FSC.DEL/177/08).  Switzerland recommended a closing 
session to consider possible follow-up actions by "OSCE 
bodies."  Italy said a distinction needed to be made between 
terrorist use of the Internet to disseminate propaganda and 
terrorist attacks on or through the Internet.  USDEL had 
earlier provided comments (ref) from Washington to Estonia, 
which welcomed these and other comments and will soon convene 
a "task force" of interested delegations and Secretariat 
members to refine the plans for the work shop. 
 
 
USOSCE 00000274  003 OF 004 
 
 
UNSCR 1540 
---------- 
 
¶11. (SBU) Luxembourg (Pilot) recalled in the working group 
that the U.S. had intervened in the November 10 Security 
Committee (Permanent Council) meeting to recommend broadening 
the scope of OSCE efforts to implement UNSCR 1540, which 
requires all states to prevent the spread of WMD to non-state 
actors, to include the Borders and Actions against Terrorism 
Units.  Pilot asked the chair what would be the future role 
of the FSC in implementing 1540?  The chair (Kangaste) said 
he was aware of the U.S. comments in the Security Committee 
and the CiO was coordinating efforts within the OSCE to 
implement 1540. 
 
¶12. (SBU) The U.S. (Silberberg) affirmed that the scale of 
1540 work at the OSCE should be broad and encouraged the 
chair and delegations to discuss the future of 1540 
implementation at the OSCE with the UN 1540 committee chair, 
Ambassador Jorge Urbina, when he visits the FSC on December 
¶10. 
 
¶13. (SBU) Russia (Ulyanov) said it found the U.S. remarks in 
the Security Committee interesting but it would need some 
time to formulate a response.  Its initial thought was to 
keep 1540 work in the FSC ad "avoid too many cooks."  Ulyanov 
also warned that the FSC chair (Kangaste) should not be 
coordinating with the Security Committee, as the Forum and 
the committee were not "equals": the FSC's equal is the 
Permanent Council.  If Kangaste needs to coordinate with the 
Security Committee, he should be doing so as a working group 
chair. 
 
Pavlov Departs 
-------------- 
 
¶14. (SBU) Vasily Pavlov, the Belarusian representative in the 
FSC, Joint Consultative Group (CFE), and Open Skies 
Consultative Commission for the last four years plus has been 
reassigned to Minsk where he will work on OSCE issues at the 
MFA.  In his farewell remarks, he encouraged the FSC to 
resume normative work including "updating and improving" the 
base documents of the OSCE political-military acquis, 
including the Vienna Document and OSCE Document on SALW. 
Pavlov's replacement is Dmitry Krayushkin. 
 
Russian Visas for VD99 Inspections 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶15. (SBU) Russia announced in an F41 notification (ref B) 
that personnel on Vienna Document inspections of Russia who 
require visas will receive visas at the entry points (POEs) 
of St. Petersburg and Kaliningrad and the Moscow airports 
(Vnukovo, Domodedevo, and Sheremetyevo).  Use of other entry 
points will require visas issued through Russian consular 
offices on the territory of the pS notifying intention to 
inspect.  UK (Gare), Canadian (Gosal) and U.S. 
representatives (Hnatczuk) discussed the visa requirements on 
the margins of the FSC and agreed to raise the matter with 
their capitals.
