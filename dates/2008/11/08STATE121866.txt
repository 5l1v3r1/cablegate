SUBJECT: TRAVEL ALERT NICARAGUA 
 
¶1.  The Department of State warns U.S. citizens about 
heightened security concerns in Nicaragua, and advises 
U.S. citizens traveling to or already in Nicaragua to 
maintain a high level of vigilance and to take 
appropriate steps to increase their security awareness. 
This Travel Alert expires on December 12, 2008. 
 
¶2.  Municipal elections across Nicaragua took place on 
November 9, 2008.  Violent demonstrations followed and 
witnesses have reported numerous injuries.  The situation 
remains fluid.  Street protests and or clashes are likely 
to continue in the coming days and can be unpredictable 
in time, place, and intensity. 
 
¶3.  Activities observed during protests include but are 
not limited to tear gas, rubber bullets, setting off 
fireworks, rock-throwing, tire burning, road blocks, bus 
and vehicle burning, and physical violence between law 
enforcement and protestors or between political rivals. 
Activities tend to become increasingly violent in the 
early afternoon.  Passersby and observers are not immune 
from the effects of these protests. 
 
¶4.  We remind U.S. citizens that even events intended to 
be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly 
escalate into violence.  We urge American citizens to 
avoid the affected areas if possible, and to exercise 
caution when in the vicinity of any large gathering. 
U.S. citizens should monitor media coverage of local 
events and be aware of their surroundings at all times. 
 
¶5.  Americans traveling abroad should regularly review 
the U.S. Embassy's website 
(http://nicaragua.usembassy.gov) and the U.S. Department 
of State's Bureau of Consular Affairs' website 
www.travel.state.gov, where the current Worldwide 
Caution, Travel Warnings, Travel Alerts, and Country 
Specific Information can be found.  The U.S. Embassy also 
encourages U.S. citizens to review to "A Safe Trip 
Abroad," found at 
http://travel.state.gov/travel/tips/safety/sa fety_1747.ht 
ml, which includes valuable security information for those 
both living and traveling abroad.  In addition to 
information on the Internet, travelers may obtain up-to- 
date information on security conditions by calling 1-888- 
407-4747 toll-free in the United States and Canada, or 
outside the United States and Canada on a regular toll 
line at 1-202-501-4444. 
 
¶6.  The U.S. Embassy in Managua is located at Km 5 1/2 C. 
Sur Managua, Nicaragua.  The U.S. Embassy in Managua can 
be reached 24/7 at 011-505-252-7100.  For emergencies 
(deaths, arrests, etc.) after hours, U.S. citizens can 
call this phone number and ask for the Embassy Duty 
Officer.  The American Citizen Services unit also is 
available by email at ACS.Managua@state.gov. 
 
¶7.  General information regarding consular services is 
available by calling 011-505-252-7888.  Non-emergency 
services for U.S. citizens are available Monday through 
Friday, 1:00 to 3:00 PM, except on Nicaraguan and U.S.
