Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Transitional Federal Government (TFG) Foreign Minister Ali 
Ahmed Jama said in an October 7 press conference that the TFG had no 
plans to recognize South Ossetia and Abkhazia.  Jama stated that the 
Somali Ambassador to Moscow had been recalled to Somalia to explain 
any statements that were made on the subject.  Jama concluded that 
Somalia is not in a position to recognize the two regions, and is in 
fact "not seized" with this issue at all.  End summary.

TFG "Not Seized" with This Issue 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) On the heels of Somali Ambassador to Russia Mohammed 
Khandule's recent statement to Russian media that Somalia will 
recognize South Ossetia and Abkhazia, Transitional Federal 
Government (TFG) Foreign Minister Ali Ahmed Jama hosted a press 
conference at the Somalia embassy in Nairobi to clarify the TFG's 
stance.  Jama opened the press conference, with approximately 25 
international, Kenyan and Somali journalists present, with a 
statement that the TFG had "neither discussed nor made a decision" 
on recognition of the two regions.  Jama said reports that the TFG 
would recognize the two regions were "totally false." 
 
¶3. (U) Jama stated that Khandule had been recalled to Somalia to 
clarify whether he had made any statements on this subject, and, if 
so, what he had said.  Jama appeared to have no firm grasp of what, 
if anything, Khandule may have said or claimed to have said.  Asked 
if Khandule has been relieved of his duties, Jama said Khandule had 
merely been called back for consultations, and that a decision on 
his future as Ambassador would be reached following an 
investigation. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Mohamed Osman Aden, Political Counselor at the Somalia 
embassy, confirmed to Emboff that Khandule was en route to Somalia, 
via Dubai, but Aden did not know when Khandule he would arrive in 
Somalia.  Aden stated that Khandule is indeed the TFG's appointed 
Ambassador to Russia and that he had been "reconfirmed" in the 
recent past.
