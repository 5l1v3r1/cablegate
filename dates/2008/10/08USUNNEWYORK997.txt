SUBJECT: UNGA: UN PASSES 17TH ANNUAL RESOLUTION AGAINST THE 
CUBAN EMBARGO 
 
REF: STATE 115034 
 
¶1.  Summary:  In plenary session on October 29, the UN 
General Assembly (UNGA) passed its 17th annual resolution 
condemning the United States embargo on Cuba with near 
unanimity, slightly more one-sided than last year.  The usual 
diatribes were accompanied by more measured language from the 
EU and Norway.  The final score was 185-3-2, with two 
absences.  The President of the General Assembly (PGA) broke 
new ground in condemning the United States and hinted at his 
views of UN reform.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  After PGA Miguel Brockmann d'Escoto introduced the 
Secretary-General's report (A/63/93), he opened debate on the 
Resolution on the Necessity of Ending the Economic, 
Commercial and Financial Embargo Imposed by the United States 
of America Against Cuba (A/63/L.4). 
 
¶3.  The PGA closed the list after 30 speakers signed up, from 
Antigua and Barbuda (on behalf of the G77), Egypt (for the 
Non-Aligned Movement), Guyana (for CARICOM), Venezuela, 
Mexico, Vietnam, Sudan, South Africa, China, Algeria, Iran, 
India, Russia, Angola, Zambia, the United States, Nicaragua, 
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Tanzania, Cuba, France (for 
the EU), Brazil, Laos, Indonesia, Burma, Belarus, Ecuador, 
Syria, Norway and Uganda. 
 
¶4.  Three hours and five minutes of debate yielded 22 
accusations of violating international law, 23 criticisms of 
unilateralism, and 29 uses of the word "extraterritorial." 
French and Norwegian delegates were the only Member States to 
hedge, admitting this is "primarily a bilateral matter 
between the United States and Cuba" but nevertheless calling 
for an end to the embargo.  South African PermRep Dumisani 
Kumalo closed his remarks with "Viva Commandante Fidel." 
 
¶5.  Russia, China and Vietnam supported the "rights of 
nations" to choose their own political systems without 
"interference."  Venezuela, Vietnam, China and India all 
dwelled on hardships endured by the Cuban people, especially 
women and children, allegedly due to the embargo.  Mexico 
said that any sanctions should be based on UN decisions. 
With Egyptian PermRep Maged Abdelaziz as spokesman, the 
Non-Aligned Movement took the rhetoric one step further, 
calling for USG compensation to Cuba.  Syria used the 
occasion to criticize the United States for, most recently, 
"flagrant aggression against Syria." 
 
¶6.  Less stridently, French Deputy PermRep Jean-Pierre 
Lacroix claimed the embargo hampers Cuba's development.  He 
urged the United States to implement the May 18, 1998 London 
Understanding covering waivers for Titles III and IV of the 
Helms-Burton Act.  Lacroix noted that the human rights 
situation in Cuba has not fundamentally changed, that the 
Government of Cuba (GoC) continues to deny freedoms to its 
citizens, and Cuba's achievements are undermined by its 
restrictions on human rights.  Lacroix called for freedom of 
expression and information as well as the unconditional 
release all political prisoners. 
 
¶7.  Cuban FM Felipe Perez Roque recounted suffering in Cuba, 
and departing from his prepared text, worried about the 
health of his children in light of the embargo.  Addressing 
the United States, Perez lectured, "Your Secretary of State 
doesn't come to this debate because she has nothing to say. 
You use lies, we use the truth.  You threaten, we never 
threaten...You gentlemen should feel ashamed, you are 
alone...the embargo is a genocidal and illegal policy." 
 
¶8.  Received with whooping and widespread loud applause, the 
final count was 185 votes for resolution 63/7, three opposing 
(United States, Israel and Palau), two abstentions (the 
Marshall Islands and Micronesia), and two absences (Iraq and 
El Salvador).  Since the previous year's resolution 62/3 had 
184 votes, four opposing votes, one abstention, and three 
absences, the United States slipped one notch in each voting 
category.  The Marshall Islands changed last year's vote to 
an abstention, and Albania, an absentee last year, voted for 
the resolution. 
 
¶10.  PGA d'Escoto closed the meeting commenting on the 
"illegal criminal embargo" against his "sister country" and 
USG "unwholesome stubbornness," and praise for "Fidel, a hero 
of international solidarity."  The PGA remarked that the 
United States "has been rightfully repudiated and 
condemned...We will do all we can to insure the overwhelming 
opinion here is no longer flouted."
