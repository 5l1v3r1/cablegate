¶1. (U) SEE ACTION REQUEST IN PARAGRAPH 4. 
 
¶2. (SBU) SUMMARY:  Despite repeated approaches over several 
months, the Ministry of Defense has not made a decision 
regarding the research vessel Oceanus' request to enter 
Egyptian waters in order to conduct meteorological and 
geological research in the Red Sea.  Embassy Cairo delivered 
Ref A request to the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and 
Scientific Research in July.  In September, both ministries 
told us that the sticking point was opposition from MoD. We 
believe that MoD is stalling because it does not want to 
refuse the Oceanus' request outright and that the Oceanus 
will have to forego the Egypt portion of its research 
mission.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Embassy Cairo delivered Ref A request to conduct 
research in the Red Sea in July, on behalf of a joint project 
of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution of the U.S. and 
King Abdullah University of Science and Technology of Saudi 
Arabia.  The line ministries (Foreign Affairs and Scientific 
Research) had no objection but noted that they could not 
proceed without the concurrence of the Ministry of Defense 
(MoD).  MoD has not responded to various approaches on this 
issue for two months.  On October 20, Major General Ahmed 
Motaz, Chief of U.S. Affairs, told polmiloff that he is 
waiting for further information from the Ministry of Higher 
Education before making a decision.  COMMENT:  The GOE is 
suspicious of academic research missions in general and 
imposes a highly bureaucratic review process.  MoD is wary of 
maritime research missions in particular and refused 
permission to the last U.S. academic research vessel we 
requested clearance for, in 2002.  The Ministry of Higher 
Education has no official role in reviewing scientific 
research requests from foreign institutions.  We interpret MG 
Motaz' point as a stalling tactic because MoD does not want 
to refuse R/V Oceanus' request outright. END COMMENT. 
 
¶4. (SBU)  ACTION REQUEST:  The R/V Oceanus has started the 
second leg of its research in the Red Sea, having already 
received clearance from Sudanese and Saudi Arabian 
authorities to enter their waters.  We do not anticipate that 
we will get a decision from GOE authorities in time to allow 
the Oceanus to enter Egyptian waters on schedule.  We will 
continue to seek a favorable decision with MoD but apprised 
the research team on board the Oceanus on October 20 of the 
situation.  We request that OES/OA provide post with at least 
six months notice for future maritime research missions as 
well as proposed dates of Suez Canal transit.  OES should 
advise academic institutions that it will likely be necessary 
to have an official GOE observer on board maritime research 
missions in order to secure permission to work in Egyptian 
waters.  END ACTION REQUEST.
