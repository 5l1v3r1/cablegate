Main Stories: 
------------- 
Al Quds leads with news of a stabbing incident on October 23 in Gilo 
in Jerusalem. All front pages report that a 20 year old Palestinian 
from the Tuqu village south of Bethlehem, killed an Israeli man and 
injured an Israeli policeman before himself being injured and taken 
into custody by the Israeli military.  The Israeli military later 
"stormed" Tuqu village and demolished the perpetrator's house and 
arrested his sister and another young man. 
 
Al Ayyam leads with news of the expected deployment of 550 
Palestinian Authority police to Hebron, in coordination with Israel. 
 The deployment, which is to begin in surrounding villages and later 
move into the city, has been criticized by Israeli settlers who 
claim that the Israeli "caretaker government" has no mandate to 
approve the deployment.  In related reporting, Al Quds reports on an 
inside page that the Israeli military on October 23 confiscated 
agricultural equipment used for a land reclamation project in 
Hebron. 
 
Al Quds and Al Ayyam quote Egypt's President Mubarak on their front 
pages telling Israeli President Peres that the Arab peace initiative 
is a complete package not subject to negotiation.  Mubarak, who met 
with Peres in Sharm al Sheikh on October 23, also highlighted his 
intention to conclude a Hamas-Israel prisoner exchange deal.  For 
his part, Peres confirmed that Israel accepts the Arab initiative 
and the two-state solution.  In related reporting, Al Hayat Al 
Jadida runs a front page quote by PLO negotiation chief Erekat 
stating on October 23 in Tokyo that the next U.S. president will be 
committed to [continuing] the peace process, immediately following 
his election. 
 
On inter-Palestinian dialogue, Al Quds' front page runs quotes by 
Salih Zidan, Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine polit 
bureau member stating his expectation that the Cairo unity talks 
will result in approval by all Palestinian factions of the Egyptian 
proposal for unity, including a timetable for implementation. 
 
Al Quds' front page reports that the, "largest-ever parliamentary 
delegation," will visit Gaza in November and include Arab and 
European legislators.  The visit will be organized by the European 
Campaign to Lift the Siege of Gaza.  In related news, Al Hayat Al 
Jadida reports on an inside page that Israel is preventing dozens of 
experts from attending a conference in Gaza that will discuss mental 
health issues related to the "siege" on the Strip. 
 
The visit by a U.S. Consulate delegation to Jericho is highlighted 
on an inside page in Al Quds.  The delegation included American 
officials from the Consulate's economic section who met with the 
Mayor of Jericho.  The Mayor thanked the U.S. government for 
supporting the Palestinian people and explained the city's need for 
a new sewage system.  The mayor explained that the Jordan River, 
which was once a tourist attraction and agricultural area, is being 
turned into a garbage dump by Israel.  He also called for the 
removal of Israeli checkpoints around Jericho.  A separate Al Quds' 
inside page report notes that the U.S. delegation also met with 
Kamil Sunnoqrot, Director of Tel Sultan Tourism Resort, who briefed 
them on Jericho tourism and demanded the removal of an Israeli 
checkpoint, north of Jericho, to facilitate tourists' access to the 
city.

¶1.  Azmi Khawaja, Palestinian National Legislative Council Member, 
opines in Al Ayyam under the title, "Cairo dialogues approach a 
decisive moment"(10/24): "We must succeed in these talks, because 
their failure would threaten the Palestinian cause... Successful 
talks would mean an end to the Gaza siege... and the opening of 
corridors for passage including between the West Bank and Gaza... 
We need to understand that Israel does not want an independent 
Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. Israel only 
wants an economic peace, not a political one... After the successful 
conclusion of the talks, we will be standing before a crossroads, 
either the Israelis accept Palestinian demands for establishing a 
Palestinian state, the return Jerusalem, and the withdrawal to 1967 
borders... or we are heading into a third Palestinian intifada that 
will continue until the Israeli occupation is removed... 
Palestinians have tried the Madrid peace conference, the Oslo 
accords, the [Middle East] Quartet, the promises of George Bush, the 
Annapolis conference, Tony Blair - all of them have failed.  We have 
not progressed one step forward towards a final agreement." 
 
¶2.  Lawyer Ibrahim Shaban writes in Al Quds under the title 
"Palestinian municipal elections in Arab Jerusalem" (10/24):  "What 
prevents Palestinians from holding their own municipal elections and 
electing a municipal council and a mayor [for Jerusalem] like they 
do in Hebron or Nablus....is the occupation [really] the central 
obstacle?  Don't they [Palestinian Authority] hold negotiations at 
all levels?  Why don't they hold urgent negotiations on this 
matter?"
