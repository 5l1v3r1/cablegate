SUBJECT: KOSOVO ICJ RESOLUTION AT UNGA -- LIBYA 
 
REF: STATE 105796 
 
Drawing on background and talking points contained in reftel, we 
informed via dipnote on October 6 the General People's Committee 
for Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation (MFA 
equivalent) of the USG intention to vote against the Serbian 
resolution at UNGA concerning the legality of Kosovo's 
declaration of independence.  We urged Libya to join us and 
other concerned countries in voting against the measure.  We 
have been unable to meet with appropriate Libyan officials at 
the General People's Committee because of their Ramadan and the 
Eid al-Fitr holiday work schedules.  Given Libya's previous 
position on Kosovo, we expect that its delegation to the UNGA is 
likely to vote with any emerging Arab/Islamic consensus.
