REF: STATE 95270 
 
In response to reftel request, Vasily Titushkin, the MFA Legal 
Department's Executive Secretary in charge of Antarctic Treaty 
issues, informed Post that Russia has no jurisdiction over the 
companies named in reftel.  The GOR understands that The Antarctic 
Company (TAC) and Antarctic Logistics Centre International (ALCI) 
are both incorporated in South Africa and therefore subject to South 
African law.  ALCI has provided logistical support for GOR 
activities in connection with the International Polar Year and 
occasionally for other transportation needs in Antarctica, and ALCI 
has leased Russian-built aircraft.  However, Russia assumes no 
regulatory oversight over ALCI or TAC expeditions.
