¶1. (SBU) Head of the Americas Desk at the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs (MFA) Oussama Khachab orally informed us September 18 that 
Lebanon undertook the necessary measures regarding the nine names 
approved by 1267 Sanctions Committee (List 103).  He indicated that 
"the Special Investigation Commission (SIC) fighting money 
laundering and terrorism finance has sent to the Lebanese mission to 
the UN a sealed envelope to be delivered to the UN Commission 
(Taliban and al Qaida Sanctions Committee) that was formed in 
compliance with resolution 1267." 
 
¶2. (SBU) SIC Secretary told us September 25 that the SIC has 
circulated the list of names to all banks operating in Lebanon, and 
banks reported that they have no accounts under these names.
