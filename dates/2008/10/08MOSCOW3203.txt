¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The Russian Federal Veterinary 
and Phytosanitary Surveillance Service (VPSS) 
informed via official letter that as of October 
28, that another U.S. poultry plant (P-7927) was 
delisted after routine tests revealed the 
presence of Salmonella.  The letter requests that 
the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service 
(FSIS) conduct an investigation into how this 
foodborne pathogen found its way into poultry 
shipments to Russia.  The original scanned copy 
of the VPSS letter and courtesy translation were 
sent to FSIS on October 29, 2008 (REF A).  An 
informal embassy translation of the letter 
follows.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) BEGIN TEXT: 
Moscow, October 28, 2008 
No. FS-NV-2/10941 
 
Assistant Deputy Administrator 
USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) 
Dr. William James 
 
The Federal Veterinary and Phytosanitary 
Surveillance Service (VPSS) extends its regards 
to the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service 
(FSIS) and informs you of the following: 
 
Salmonella was detected recently during routine 
testing of residues of prohibited and harmful 
substances in poultry shipments (chicken 
quarters) imported from the United States (lab 
test results No. 7905/B-5933 of September 25, 
2008; No. 8556/B-6552, 8554/B-6550, 8555/B-6551 
of October 13, 2008).  The product was 
manufactured at establishment No. P-7927 
(veterinary certificates No. RFA-039425, RFA- 
039424, RFA-039423 of April 16, 2008). 
 
Coccidiostat salinomycin was also detected in 
poultry shipments from U.S. establishment No. P- 
758 (lab test results No. 1652 of October 8, 
2008; veterinary certificate No. RFA-049572 of 
August 21, 2008). 
 
Antibiotics of tetracycline group were found in 
the shipments of poultry that were produced at 
the U.S. establishment No. P-1309 (lab results 
No. 478M, 480M of September 22, 2008).  The 
poultry was imported to the Russian Federation 
with veterinary certificates No. RFA-027512, RFA- 
027514, RFA-027516 of August 1, 2008. 
 
The cases mentioned above are violations of the 
requirements set forth in the negotiated 
veterinary certificate for export of poultry to 
the Russian Federation. 
 
Therefore, VPSS informs you that temporary 
restrictions on the import of products from 
above-mentioned establishments come into force on 
October 28, 2008.  In addition, VPSS requests 
that you conduct an investigation to determine 
why illegal substances are being found in 
veterinary products shipped from the United 
States to Russia.  VPSS asks you to take urgent 
measures to prevent the shipment of meat and 
poultry products to Russia that do not fully 
comply with the requirements of the Russian 
Federation and the negotiated veterinary 
certificates. 
 
Please inform VPSS about the results of 
investigation and the preventative measures FSIS 
 
will take to stop these types of occurrences from 
taking place in the future. 
 
Dr. James, let me assure you in my highest 
esteem.

Acting Head

¶3. (SBU) COMMENT: Russia currently has a zero- 
tolerance policy for foodborne pathogens, such as 
Salmonella.  To date, Russia has not offered any 
scientific basis for such an unreasonably strict 
regime, which is not consistent with 
international sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) 
norms.  Although Russia has agreed to abide by 
international SPS standards as of the date of WTO 
accession, or to provide a scientific basis to 
justify stricter standards during regular 
engagements and consultations, we recommend that 
USDA and USTR officials continue to urge Russian 
negotiators to immediately adopt international 
SPS standards at upcoming meetings in Geneva and 
Washington, DC.  No less should be accepted of an 
aspiring WTO member.
