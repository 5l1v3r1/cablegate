SUBJECT: SYRIAN ARTISTS DEMAND RETURN OF ARTWORK ON DISPLAY AT U.S. 
AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE 
 
¶1.  On October 29, a letter was delivered in person to the American 
Cultural Center by Syrian artist AbdulJabbar Weis, with whom the 
mission has previously had a cordial relationship.  The letter was 
written on behalf of five artists who have works on display at the 
U.S. Ambassador's residence in Damascus.  They requested the return 
of their artwork; the Embassy will respond to their letter and 
comply with the request in the coming week. 
 
¶2.  Text of letter: 
 
October 29, 2008 
 
To the Director of the American Cultural Center 
 
I am graphic artist AbdulJabber Weis.  On behalf of myself and my 
colleagues graphic artists Muhammad Ghannoum, Itab Hreib, Fadi 
Yazizi, and Muhannad Orabi, we request the withdrawal of our artwork 
from the residence of the American Ambassador in Damascus because of 
the mean aggression against our country by the American helicopters 
two days ago which killed Syrian civilian victims, including a 
father and his sons.  We are far above displaying our artwork, which 
reflects our civilization and culture, in the Embassy of a current 
government that believes in a culture of killing, conquering, and 
enslaving people. 
 
Your current government has engaged in oppression and conquering, 
making the name of your country -- America - synonymous with all 
those who are enemies of humankind.  There is no crime, aggression, 
or theft of people's resources in this world that your country's 
government has not committed.  You current government has come to 
resemble the government of ancient Rome that destroyed 
civilizations, killed peoples, and placed kings and knights of its 
enemies in closed playgrounds to become meals for tigers and lions, 
to satisfy the blood lust of the Roman rulers.  After a period of 
history that witnessed glory and prosperity, the Roman Empire 
collapsed and was destroyed completely.  Nothing remains of its 
arrogance except drawings on walls and pillars and the remains of 
arenas and other ruins.  People read the stories of the Roman 
oppression to their children from history books.  We are sure all 
future generations and peoples will write about the oppression and 
aggression brought about by your current government under the 
leadership of President George Bush, the son.  His actions will 
never be forgotten. 
 
For the reasons mentioned above, we request the return of our 
artwork as soon as possible, and before the end of the week. 
 
AbdulJabber Weis
