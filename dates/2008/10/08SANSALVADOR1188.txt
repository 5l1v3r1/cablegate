REF: STATE 103725 
 
Poloff delivered Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) 
non-paper on technical workshop for Egypt and Israel to 
Gustavo Argueta, MFA Multilateral Affairs Officer, on October 
Â¶3.  Argueta said the GOES is in favor of the workshop and 
asked if the USG planned to bring the workshop proposal to 
the resolution discussion.  In a follow-up response October 
8, Argueta suggested that the USG share the workshop proposal 
with as many allied countries as possible, and recommended 
promoting the idea by holding an informal discussion session 
in New York.  Should the USG choose to hold a discussion of 
this type, Argueta asked that the Salvadoran mission be 
invited.
