In Today's Papers 
 
Harsh Messages from the Military 
All papers give extensive front page coverage to Chief of General 
Staff General Ilker Basbug's press statement following a military 
ceremony in Balikesir.  Basbug responded harshly to news reports 
indicating the military had prior knowledge of a potential PKK 
attack against the Aktutun military outpost, but did nothing to 
prevent the attack.  General Basbug said "we have launched legal 
action against those who leaked classified information and used it 
in their reports.  The attack in Bayraktepe was a suicide attack for 
the terrorist organization but an epic of heroism for the Turkish 
soldiers who fought there.  Those who praise the terrorist 
organization are responsible for the blood that has been and will be 
shed.  I want all to understand this.  The Armed Forces are 
stronger, more determined and resolute than ever.  Therefore, my 
final say on the matter is: I am warning everyone to be careful know 
their place."  Leftist Taraf says the warnings issued by Basbug were 
"incompatible with democracy."  Liberal Radikal notes that that the 
hard-line attitude of Basbug was "not fitting with his position as 
Chief of the General Staff."  Islamist oriented Yeni Safak says 
"Basbug should respond the allegations for neglect in Aktutun 
outpost instead of criticizing the media."  Milliyet editor Sedat 
Ergin says "Basbug can use such an approach in army headquarters but 
not with the public." 
 
Meanwhile, CNN Turk, Radikal, Milliyet and Sabah report that the 
Military Court declared a news blackout for the reports regarding 
Aktutun attack until the military has completed their internal 
investigation.  The news blackout will be valid until the military 
completes its investigation on the issue. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Basbug's Response to Criticism of the 
Military 
 
Ergun Babahan wrote in mainstream Sabah:  "It is a very serious 
issue that reports on the Aktutun attack were leaked from TGS 
headquarters to the press.  It might look like an example of 
successful journalism, but it is very troubling information can leak 
from TGS headquarters this often.  It is understandable for General 
Basbug to defend his institution, however, I believe that he must 
respect press freedom." 
 
Dogan Heper wrote in mainstream Milliyet: "General Basbug used a 
very harsh tone in his statement yesterday and everyone found this 
harshness to be rather strange.  Of course, It was his duty to 
respond to the allegations about the Aktutun attack but couldn't he 
explain the facts in a different tone?" 
 
Gungor Mengi wrote in mainstream Vatan:  "While we were expecting 
clarification from General Basbug (regarding Taraf's claims of 
negligence), instead Basbug responded with an extreme reaction and 
the press received this as some sort of warning or threat.  The 
Chief of General Staff should understand that the media will report 
news.  I respect the commander's sensitivities on this issue however 
I object to the tone and his style in his statement." 
 
19 Policemen Could Be Sentenced to Life in Prison for Ceber Torture 
Case 
Media outlets report 19 police officers charged with causing the 
death of leftist activist Engin Ceber said they used "proportionate 
force" against Ceber.  Engin Ceber died after a brain hemorrhage 
sustained as a result of torture he experienced during police 
custody and later in prison.  Justice Minister Mehmet Ali Sahin said 
the inspectors' report about the death of an inmate in jail will be 
submitted to the prosecutor.  Sahin is quoted as saying article 94 
of the penal code envisages life sentence for officials responsible 
for the death of a citizen as a result of torture. 
 
Poll: Ruling AKP's Popularity on Decline 
 
ANKARA 00001801  002 OF 002 
 
 
Mainstream Vatan carries the results of a survey conducted by 
Metropol polling company, known to be close to the ruling AKP.  The 
survey shows the AKP's popularity dove from 50.9 percent in 
September to 35 percent in October, marking a 31 percent decline in 
the number of voters baking the party.   Support for CHP has risen 
by 6 points, and for MHP by 2 points.  The distribution public 
support for the political parties in October is as follows: AKP 35.0 
percent, CHP 15.5, MHP 8.6, DTP 3.4, others 3.8, and indecisive 
13.9. 
 
Turkish Warship on its way to Somalia to Fight Pirates 
Sabah, Radikal, Cumhuriyet and Zaman report NATO European Command 
(SHAPE) sent a seven-vessel NATO alliance fleet, including Turkish 
warship Gokova, to the Indian Ocean to protect shipping from the 
growing threat of pirates along offshore Somalia.  According to 
NATO's 2004 Istanbul Summit, the "deterrent" fleet will also visit 
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, and UAE. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Barzani-Turkey, PKK 
 
Mustafa Balbay writes in leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet: "Massoud 
Barzani says Turkey should look within for a resolution to the 
Kurdish problem, and makes a genial suggestion such to lower the 
election threshold.  Barzani has already begun political operations 
against Turkey while we're talking about operations into northern 
Iraq.  Erdogan's disregard of this fact and his statement that 
Turkey has been late in talking to Barzani and Talabani prove that 
the PM is not looking at the struggle against terror through the 
eyes of Ankara.  The AKP has already set up a buffer zone between 
the opposition and state institutions in Ankara." 
 
Mumtazer Turkone opines in Islamist-oriented Zaman: "You cannot 
reach perfection without criticism.  A military that is not 
criticized will lose credibility in the eyes of the public.  But, an 
army must not be alienated from the people it seeks to protect.  The 
PM asked during his party group address earlier this week whether 
the PKK was an enemy or merely criminals.  If the PKK is an enemy, 
it must be destroyed.  If the PKK are only guilty criminals, they 
must be apprehended and tried in line with judicial procedures."
