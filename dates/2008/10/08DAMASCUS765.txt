News Summary 
------------ 
 
Â¶1. Only government-owned daily al-Thawrah was published on Friday 
October 31. al-Thawrah gave pride of place to strident coverage of 
the alleged U.S. raid in Abu al-Kamal. The top half of its front 
page reported on the protest march organized by the Syrian 
government on October 30 in downtown Damascus and a condolence visit 
by the Minister of Labor and Social Affairs, on behalf of President 
Assad, to families of the victims in AlbuKamal.  The article was 
accompanied by a huge photograph of the demonstration. Pages 2-3 
were fully devoted to coverage of the demonstration and messages 
received from regional and international groups and leaders 
condemning the attack.

Editorial 
--------- 
"Perpetual Fumbling:" (op-ed by columnist Mustafa al-Miqdad) 
 
"The Bush Administration once again has confirmed the loss of its 
[moral] compass in its political, military, intelligence, and 
strategic calculations. It chose to launch the aggressive attack on 
civilians working near the border under the pretext of anticipating 
a confrontation with 'terrorists'... . 
 
"The current Bush Administration is in a perpetual crisis which is 
still providing reasons for it to continue to pursue a policy of 
murder and criminality under the pretext of combating the 
'terrorism' hidden in the Islamic world, according to its 
superstitious beliefs. 
 
"The occupation and the Bush Administration, threatened by the loss 
of the Republican seat in the White House, are practicing a war of 
psychology and distortion against the American people a few days 
before the presidential elections in an attempt to implant its idea 
of pursuing terrorism in all corners of the world and of carrying 
out preemptive strikes... 
 
"The Syrian response came with clear indications and I believe that 
more responses are still in the Syrian basket. There is no doubt 
that it is able to uncover the falsehood of the American allegations 
and the [U.S.] Administration's fumbling, as a great power, in 
taking an effective international role."
