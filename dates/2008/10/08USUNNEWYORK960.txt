Classified By: Ambassador Alejandro D. Wolff for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d 
). 
 
¶1.  (C) Summary: Ambassador Khalilzad told the President of 
the UN General Assembly (PGA) October 20 that the PGA's 
decision to accelerate intergovernmental negotiations on UN 
Security Council expansion had alienated a number of 
significant countries including the U.S., which had helped 
facilitate the compromise decision and timeline during the 
last session.  The PGA said he had not realized the 
significance of the dates in the decision document and said 
he would "soft-pedal" his previous decision and not formally 
launch negotiations November 21.  The Afghan Perm Rep who has 
been named by the PGA to chair the negotiations told 
Ambassador Khalilzad October 20 that he would make the 
November 21 meeting a short preparatory meeting only.  The 
PGA confirmed he plans to hold an Interactive Panel on the 
Global Financial Crisis, October 30, with five experts who 
will discuss the subject and take questions from member 
states.  On the Saudi-proposed High-level meeting scheduled 
for November 12-13, the PGA confirmed that he expects at 
least 30 heads of state, including the Pakistani president. 
End summary. 
 
UN Security Council Reform 
-------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (C) Ambassador Khalilzad raised in an October 20 meeting 
with the President of the General Assembly (PGA) Miguel 
d'Escoto Brockmann his concern that the PGA's decision to 
accelerate intergovernmental negotiations on UN Security 
Council expansion (ref A) had alienated a number of 
significant countries.  Ambassador Khalilzad described the 
role he had played September 15 in facilitating the 
compromise decision (62/557) and the importance of the 
timeline in those negotiations (ref B).  He urged the PGA to 
signal to the Uniting for Consensus (UFC) bloc that the 
Open-ending Working Group (OEWG) should make every effort to 
come to an agreement on framework and modalities by February 
1, 2009, and that if there is no agreement, then 
intergovernmental negotiations will start no later than 
February 28, 2009.  Ambassador Khalilzad strongly suggested 
that the PGA tell the membership that formal negotiations 
will not start until after the February 1, 2009 deadline for 
the OEWG's discussions. 
 
¶3.  (C) The PGA replied that he had not been aware of the 
significance of the dates until the Egyptian Perm Rep met 
with him on October 17.  (Comment: We find it hard to believe 
that the PGA did not grasp the importance of the dates 
contained in the decision.  However, this expression of 
naivete may be his way to save face.  End comment.)  The PGA 
said that he would "soft-pedal" his previous decision to 
launch intergovernmental negotiations on November 21. 
Ambassador Khalilzad pressed the PGA to reassure the 
membership in the November 11 OEWG meeting of his commitment 
to the timeline expressed in decision 62/557 and that the 
November 21 informal GA plenary would be a preparatory 
meeting and not a formal launch of intergovernmental 
negotiations.  (Note: According to a readout PolOff received 
from her Chinese counterpart, the Chinese DPR met October 21 
with the PGA's Chef de Cabinet Ambassador Norman Miranda who 
confirmed that intergovernmental negotiations would not be 
launched until February 2009 and described the November 21 
meeting as a "consultation" with member states.  End note.) 
 
¶4.  (C) Afghan Perm Rep Zahir Tanin, who the PGA named to 
chair the intergovernmental negotiations, told Ambassador 
Khalilzad in a separate meeting October 20 that he has also 
been lobbied hard by member states upset with the accelerated 
timeline and had approached the PGA at his own initiative on 
October 17 to relay the membership's widespread displeasure. 
Tanin agrees with the need for a period of 
confidence-building over the next several months before 
intergovernmental negotiations are launched in February. 
Tanin told Ambassador Khalilzad that he plans to hold a short 
preparatory meeting November 21 to report to the membership 
 
USUN NEW Y 00000960  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
that there is still a need for further preparations before 
launching intergovernmental negotiations. 
 
Interactive Panel on the 
Global Financial Crisis 
------------------------ 
 
¶5.  (C) The PGA said he was continuing to plan for the 
October 30 Interactive Panel on the Global Financial Crisis 
which he viewed as a service to the membership.  The format 
would be a panel discussion followed by questions from the 
membership with no speeches from member states.  He noted 
that the Secretary-General had asked him not to schedule the 
panel for October 24 when the Secretary-General would be 
hosting World Bank and IMF visitors at the UN, including 
World Bank President Robert Zoellick.  Ambassador Khalilzad 
urged the PGA to select a panel with a broad perspective. 
The PGA said that he had wanted a panel that included more 
than just economists so there could be a discussion of the 
human impact of the crisis.  The PGA said the panel would be 
composed of the following five members: Joseph Stiglitz (US) 
- chair of panel; Sir John Eatwell (UK); Pedro Paez 
(Ecuador); Prabhat Patnaik (India); and Francois Houtart 
(Belgium). 
 
Saudi-proposed Inter-faith 
High-level Meeting 
-------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (C) The PGA relayed that the Pakistani President had said 
he would come to the Saudi-proposed inter-faith high-level 
meeting November 12-13, as well as at least 30 other heads of 
state.  The PGA said he is open to any further input or 
documentation for the meeting.  Ambassador Khalilzad promised 
to send him a copy of the Astana Declaration from the recent 
Common World Forum in Astana, Kazakhstan.
