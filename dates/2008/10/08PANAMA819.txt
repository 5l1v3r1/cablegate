¶1.  (C)  1st VP and FM Samuel Lewis Navarro told the 
Ambassador October 9 that the Russian nuclear-powered russian 
crusier Petr Velikiy (Peter the Great) will cross the Canal 
in December, and make a two-day port call at the Vasco Nunez 
de Balboa navel base (former Rodman Naval Station) on 
December 13 or 14. He said that during the port call the ship 
would re-supply and the crew would have liberty. Lewis 
downplayed the importance of the crossing, underscoring that 
the Canal was open to all. He further asserted that the 
crossing would provide the GOP an opportunity to caution the 
Russians on the way they engage in the hemisphere. 
 
¶2.  (C)  Vice Minister of Government and Justice Rodrigo 
Cigarruista (Note: Now Acting Minister of Government and 
Justice (see septel). End Note) told DATT and PolOff October 
8 that Russian Embassy was coordinating the event with the 
Panama Canal Authority (ACP) and the GOP, and that they were 
requesting a five-day port call. He said the GOP had agreed 
to the transit, but that it would not grant the special 
coordination granted to U.S. High Value Transits (HVTs), to 
prevent the Russians from learning details about how such 
crossings are protected. He said the GOP was considering 
denying the request for a port visit, so as not to be seen 
supporting the Russian's exercises with the Venezuelans. He 
said the likely excuse would be that the only pier capable of 
receiving the ship was under repair, and that they might dock 
a repair ship at the dock to reinforce the story.
