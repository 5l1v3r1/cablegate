¶1.  This cable responds to the items requested in paragraph six and 
seven of Reftel A.  Supplemental documentation will also be sent via 
e-mail.  Transportation/ICT Officer Daleya Uddin (Uddinsd@state.gov 
or +27-12-431-4344) and Economic Specialist Christo Esterhuizen 
(EsterhuizenJC@state.gov or +27-12-431-4417) are the main points of 
contact at post. 
 
¶2.   Electricity and transport infrastructure in South Africa are 
mainly developed, maintained, and controlled by South African 
Government (SAG) departments or state-controlled companies.  Reftels 
B and C and previous referenced reporting provide additional 
background information on Eskom (the state-owned power producer) and 
Reftel D provides background information on Transnet (the 
state-controlled freight and transport logistics group).

Infrastructure Bottlenecks 
Constrain Growth and Trade 
-------------------------- 
 
¶3.   Credit ratings agency Standard & Poor's estimates that 
infrastructure constraints will postpone attempts by the SAG to 
reach its earlier 6.0 percent medium-term gross domestic product 
(GDP) growth target, with potential GDP growth remaining at an 
estimated 3.9 - 4.5 percent for the foreseeable future.  The most 
important infrastructure constraints relate to transport and, most 
urgently, to power.  It is estimated that a low power capacity 
margin will shave about 0.5 percentage points off GDP growth in 
¶2008.  Sustained investment by Eskom and a greater focus on managing 
demand are likely to contain the effects thereafter, but the energy 
constraint will remain until the early years of the next decade. 
Some major energy-intensive investments have already been 
postponed/cancelled as a result of the power shortage. 
 
¶4.   Transnet officials explained that major bottlenecks occurred 
due to the lack of investment in infrastructure maintenance and 
expansion during the 1990s.  At the time, the SAG was considering 
plans to privatize some of its state-run entities and the lack of 
infrastructure investment is blamed on stalled privatization plans. 
 
¶5.   The SAG has since abandoned privatization plans and is 
currently undertaking significant infrastructure expansion projects 
through state-owned companies to address bottlenecks.  Both Eskom 
and Transnet are currently investing tens of billions of dollars to 
improve electricity and transport/logistics capacity and to address 
infrastructure bottlenecks that are hampering growth and trade. 
Investment has been lacking for many years and the cost of 
"catch-up" is rising exponentially, especially given the global 
demand and tight supply for much of the same equipment. 
 
---------------------------- 
Rising Costs and Bottlenecks 
Hurt Textile Trade 
---------------------------- 
 
¶6.   The cost of transporting and storing goods in South Africa 
amounts to approximately 14.7 percent of GDP, which industry 
officials believe is significantly higher than most of South 
Africa's trading partners.  Global fuel price increases are adding 
further pressures to transport costs since the majority of cargo is 
transported via road.  Approximately 12 percent of the South African 
textile industry's operational cost is made up of transport costs. 
 
 
¶7.   Transnet's expansion plans include shifting freight volumes 
Q7.   Transnet's expansion plans include shifting freight volumes 
from road to rail transport systems.  However, rail's share of 
freight volume is still on the downward spiral because of Transnet's 
poor history of service delivery.  Road transport infrastructure is 
being taxed by increased transport of cargo.  Rail is unable to cope 
with any volume increases due to the lack of past investment and 
protracted procurement procedures.  Where the rail infrastructure is 
operational, it is inefficient and underutilized. 
 
¶8.   The South African textile and clothing industry experiences 
long lead times for exporting goods.  For example, it takes about 26 
shipping days for the industry to transport goods to Italy, which 
makes it uncompetitive.  Shipping frequencies need to be increased 
to improve competitiveness.  The Ports of Cape Town and Durban do 
not have enough capacity to handle existing demand.  Often goods 
have to be transshipped from Cape Town to Durban because of a lack 
of capacity at Cape Town.  This additional transshipment increases 
cost and volumes handled in Durban, which has a negative impact on 
Durban's ability to cope.

World Cup and Improved Infrastructure 
Expected to Boost Tourism Growth 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶9.   Efforts are underway to increase airport infrastructure and 
create limited public transport systems in the Gauteng, Cape Town, 
and KwaZulu-Natal provinces before the start of the 2010 FIFA World 
Cup.  The World Cup has provided impetus for investments, but many 
projects extend beyond the World Cup.  The tourism sector is 
creating packages to leverage growth opportunities presented by the 
World Cup.  The Department of Transport is negotiating liberalized 
bilateral air-lift strategies to increase air service into all three 
international airports (Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Durban). Deputy 
Minister of the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism 
(DEAT) Rejoice Mabudafhasi announced that South Africa is on track 
to receive 10 million tourists per year by 2010.
