REF:    SECSTATE 112727 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Per reftel, Charge d'Affaires and poloff delivered 
demarche October 23 to Ambassador Clementine Shakembo, Diplomatic 
Counselor to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and International 
Cooperation.  (Note:  Meeting was held with Shakembo, Ministry's 
senior career employee, given unavailability of Minister and Deputy 
Minister to receive us on short notice.  End note.) 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Ambassador Shakembo pledged to transmit our message to 
Mbusa Nyamwisi, who would ensure that the message was given to the 
proper person as it was not clear who would go to the October 27 
meeting in Harare.  Shakembo did state, however, that regardless of 
who led the Congolese delegation to that meeting Foreign Minister 
Mbusa would not/not attend if Prime Minister Muzito had not yet 
formed a new government with him, Mbusa, remaining in the post of 
Foreign Minister. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) On substance, Shakembo said the difficult political 
situation in Zimbabwe will require tact, noting that the DRC had its 
own experience with power sharing agreements.  She also expressed 
sympathy for the suffering of the Zimbabwean people.  Shakembo said 
the GDRC fully understands USG views on Zimbabwe.
