¶1. (SBU) According to Monsignor Franco Coppola, Director for the 
Middle East at the Holy See Secretariat of State, the Government 
of Iran recently informed the Holy See Nuncio in Teheran that it 
does not have any information about the whereabouts of U.S. 
citizen Robert Levinson.  The GOI informed the Nuncio that the 
Swiss Ambassador, on behalf of the USG, had already raised the 
issue.  The GOI added that the Holy See has no business 
expressing interest in the case.  (Note: The Nuncio raised the 
Levinson case with the GOI at USG request (reftel A).  End 
note.) 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: The GOI's chastising reply to the Nuncio's 
inquiry about Levinson's disappearance terminates the Holy See 
attempt to elicit information on the case.  End comment.
