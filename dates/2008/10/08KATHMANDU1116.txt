SUBJECT: NEPALESE FORCES DEPLOYING TO UNAMID 
 
REF: STATE 106544 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Due to the Government of Nepal's (GON's) closure 
October 6-10, and post's own closure October 6-9, post has 
been unable to contact any high-level host government 
counterparts to assess the GON's readiness to make good on 
its previous pledge to the UN-African Union Mission in Darfur 
(UNAMID).  However, post has received no indication to date 
that perceived opposition by the Government of Sudan to 
non-African troop-contributing countries may have forced the 
GON to reconsider its pledge to provide troops for UNAMID 
(reftel).  Many of the 200 Nepalese troops trained by 
U.S.-funded programs are already in Sudan; the final of the 
three groups is expected to deploy in late October. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On October 10, post's Senior Law Enforcement 
Adviser consulted senior police officials who maintain that 
both the Nepal Police and Armed Police Force are prepared to 
increase support to UNAMID.  The GON would like to train 
additional police for UNAMID but cannot proceed until the UN 
Peacekeeping Operation administers oral and written 
proficiency examinations and provides the GON with a list of 
qualified candidates.  Post expects to receive a formal 
letter from the GON detailing its commitment to UNAMID on 
October 14. 
 
¶3.  Minimize considered.
