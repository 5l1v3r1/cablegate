¶1.  (U) Summary: DEM Party Sao Paulo incumbent Mayor Gilberto 
Kassab's surprising first-place finish in first-round Sao Paulo 
mayoral voting against PT candidate Marta Suplicy makes Kassab the 
favorite for the October 26 second-round vote.  Even more important, 
Kassab's strong showing solidifies PSDB Governor Jose Serra's status 
as favorite for the 2010 PSDB presidential nomination.  Kassab's 
come-from-behind campaign saw him outpoint Suplicy, who originally 
led in the polling, and easily vanquish PSDB candidate Geraldo 
Alckmin.  Alckmin was backed by Serra PSDB rival and Minas Gerais 
Governor Aecio Neves, whose prospects for the PSDB presidential 
nomination have now dimmed.  End Summary. 
 
Kassab's Comeback 
 
¶2.  (U) DEM Party Sao Paulo incumbent Mayor Gilberto Kassab 
surprisingly came out on top of first-round voting in Sao Paulo's 
10/5 mayoral elections, narrowly edging out PT candidate Marta 
Suplicy by a single percentage point (34 percent to 33 percent). 
Just a few weeks ago, Kassab lagged far behind in polls which showed 
him coming in third place, behind Suplicy and PSDB candidate Geraldo 
Alckmin.  A strong campaign combined with what most observers 
acknowledge is Kassab's solid record as Mayor pulled him out in 
front and now position him as the likely favorite to win the 
mayorship of Brazil's largest city against PT candidate Suplicy in 
second-round voting on 10/26.  Kassab gains critical momentum from 
this victory and is likely to be endorsed by the majority of the 
other candidates. 
 
Looking at 2010 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The Sao Paulo mayor's race is widely seen as a warm-up for 
the 2010 presidential contest, with likely contenders fighting 
through surrogates.  Kassab enjoyed the support of PSDB Governor 
Jose Serra, under whom he served as vice Mayor as part of a 
coalition PSDB-DEM administration in the Sao Paulo municipality 
before Serra's 2006 run for Governor.  Encouraged by Minas Gerais 
Governor Aecio Neves (who also has presidential ambitions), PSDB 
candidate Geraldo Alckmin threw his hat in the ring.  Alckmin 
started off strong but then, following poor debate performances and 
a lackluster campaign, wound up garnering only 22 percent of the 
vote.  Most of Alckmin's supporters will likely cast ballots for 
Kassab in the final vote. 
 
Serra Strengthened 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Kassab's performance clearly strengthens Serra's hand in 
the PSDB, making him the clear favorite to be the party's 2010 
presidential nominee.  His rival, Neves, also suffered a reverse 
when another political ally and candidate for the Mayor of Belo 
Horizonte, Marcio Lacerda (PMDB), did not score a first-round 
victory as anticipated.  Lacerda advances to the second round.
