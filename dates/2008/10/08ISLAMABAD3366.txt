REF: SECSTATE 108482 
 
On October 22, Deputy PolCouns and Poloff delivered reftel 
points to Ayesha Farhat, Assistant Director of UN-I Office 
with the MFA, concerning the readiness of Pakistan in making 
good on its scheduled contributions for the African 
Union/United Nations Hybrid operation in Darfur (UNAMID). 
Concerning its pledged 329-person engineer company for West 
Darfur and the 156-person Level III hospital in South Darfur, 
Farhat noted that this Pakistani pledge had already been 
fulfilled and the teams were on the ground in Darfur.  She 
also said that Pakistan would be unable to make further 
pledges, especially those requesting heavy air assets or 
equipment, given Pakistan's current economic situation and 
security operations along the Pak-Afghan border.
