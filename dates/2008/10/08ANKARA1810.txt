¶1. (C) We met October 16 with Basat Ozturk, DDG for Aviation 
and Maritime Affairs at MFA, to discuss Turkey,s position on 
oil and gas exploration off the coast of Cyprus.  Ozturk said 
Turkey,s position has not changed from last year (reftel), 
and will not be affected by ongoing talks between the 
Government of Cyprus (GOC) and the Turkish Republic of 
Northern Cyprus (TRNC).  The GOC has not only asserted an 
Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), Ozturk said, but also has 
tried to extend its continental shelf to cover the same 
territory without reaching a delimitation agreement with 
Turkey.  In Turkey,s view, under both general international 
law and the Law of the Sea (to which Turkey is not a party), 
Cyprus was obliged to reach a maritime delimitation agreement 
with all affected parties, including Turkey, beforehand.  It 
did not even attempt to do so. Thus, Turkey views the Cypriot 
continental shelf claims as illegal.  Without a delimitation 
agreement in place, Turkey considers all waters more than 12 
miles off the coast of Cyprus as "high seas." 
 
¶2. (C) Ozturk said Cyprus signed a maritime delimitation 
agreement with Egypt and negotiated one with Lebanon.  Turkey 
approached both governments and showed them that under the 
Turkish proposal for delimitation of the Eastern 
Mediterranean, they would have significantly larger 
continental shelves than under the Cypriot plan.  In Egypt,s 
case, the difference is 12,000 square kilometers.  As a 
result of these discussions, Egypt withdrew from its 
delimitation agreement and the Lebanese have frozen talks 
with the Cypriots.

¶3. (C) Turkey asserts a continental shelf claim to the west 
of Cyprus, between 28 degrees east and 32 degrees -- 16 
minutes -- 8 seconds east and north of the line at 34 degrees 
south.  This claim overlaps partially with the Cypriot EEZ. 
Within this zone, Ozturk said, Turkey has a "direct national 
interest" and will "actively disrupt" any exploration 
activity.  Ozturk said that "active disruption" did not need 
to be via military force.  For example, in the case of 
seismic work, Ozturk said Turkish fishing vessels might 
repeatedly circle the ship and thus prevent it from taking 
accurate readings.   Ozturk emphasized that Turkey's national 
interests in this zone can only be changed by a delimitation 
agreement with a future united Cyprus, and are outside the 
scope of the GOC-TRNC talks.

¶4. (C) Beyond its direct interests in this continental shelf 
claim area, Ozturk said Turkey has "indirect interests" in 
the seabed delimitation off Cyprus on behalf of the TRNC. 
Turkey will seek to dissuade companies from doing work in 
those areas until there is a final Cyprus settlement.  Ozturk 
said Turkey has several times successfully dissuaded 
companies from bidding on or carrying out exploration in this 
zone (see reftel) and will continue to do so.
