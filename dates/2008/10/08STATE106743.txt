¶1. This is an action request; see paras 3 and 4. 
 
---------- 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
¶2. As part of security sector reform efforts in Somalia the 
United States will provide a two-week Interdicting Terrorist 
Activities Course for nineteen Somali Transitional Federal 
Government participants.  The Committee has already granted 
an exemption to the arms embargo on Somalia established by 
the Security Council in resolution 733 (1992) for this 
training (ref A).  In our exemption request we indicated the 
course would be held in Nairobi, Kenya from 21 July through 1 
August 2008 (ref B).  Given logistical issues, the course 
will now be held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia from 13 - 24 
October 2008.  This cable requests USUN update the UNSC 
Somalia Sanctions Committee and its Monitoring Group. 
 
-------------- 
ACTION REQUEST 
-------------- 
¶3. USUN is to advise the Committee established pursuant to 
resolution 751 (1992) concerning Somalia that the date and 
location of the two-week Interdicting Terrorist Activities 
Course for nineteen Somali Transitional Federal Government 
(TFG) participants has changed.  The United States will now 
hold this training in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia from 13 - 24 
October 2008. 
 
¶4. USUN is also to inform the Monitoring Group related to the 
Committee established pursuant to resolution 751 (1992) 
concerning Somalia of the date and location change of the 
course.  USUN is also to provide the Somalia Monitoring Group 
the participant list in para 5.  The United States possesses 
no credible information of gross human rights violations for 
the nineteen candidates who have been nominated to attend the 
Interdicting Terrorist Activities course.
