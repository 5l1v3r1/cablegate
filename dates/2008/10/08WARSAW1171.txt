DILLIGENCE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 103210 
 
Post supports the goals of OPIC's proposed relationship with 
the Virgin Green Emerging Markets Fund (the Fund) and is not 
aware of any substantial political or public relations 
downside to the project.  Improving energy efficiency and 
expanding use of renewables are increasingly important 
priorities for both the Polish government and USG throughout 
the region.  Poland will likely soon face costly EU-related 
emissions caps, which will place a huge burden on its largely 
coal-dependent energy sector.  The project's proposed focus 
on supporting private sector activity in renewables, 
efficiency and water would be well received given these 
factors.  Capital markets in Poland are fairly well 
developed.  However, the energy sector is dominated by state 
controlled entities and it remains difficult to get financing 
for startup projects and long-term investments in the Fund's 
proposed areas.  Post does not know of any negative 
information regarding the prospective Fund manager's 
reputation in Poland.
