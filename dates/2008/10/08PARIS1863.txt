¶2.  (SBU) During the recent visits to Paris of USDP Eric 
Edelman (ref B) and General David Petraeus (ref C), both men 
raised with their French interlocutors the recent designation 
of General McKiernan as ISAF as well as OEF commander in 
Afghanistan.  French officials from the Elysee, MFA and MOD 
all agreed with the reasoning behind the decision to 
streamline internal U.S. command and control arrangements in 
Afghanistan by dual-hatting General McKiernan and they 
expressed support for the USG decision.  (Embassy comment: 
The U.S. command and control structure modifications were 
viewed as a purely practical decision by the GOF and the 
announcement did not raise any concerns among French 
decision-makers).
