SUBJECT: RWANDA: UNHCR SEES INCREASED POPULATION MOVEMENT 
FROM DRC, PREPARES FOR MORE 
 
¶1. (SBU) Officials from the United Nations High Commission on 
Refugees (UNHCR) in Kigali told poloffs October 29 that since 
the morning of October 28 some 1200 individuals had crossed 
from North Kivu into Rwanda near Gisenyi, and that more were 
amassing on the border.  The individuals had declined to 
register at the Nkamira Refugee Transit Center located 
outside Gisenyi, opting instead opted to stay on the grounds 
of a school compound in Gisenyi town.  According to UNHCR, 
the individuals were waiting to see the outcome of the 
fighting, and hoped to return to their homes, rather than 
seek refugee status in Rwanda or enter Internally Displaced 
Persons (IDP) camps in the DRC. 
 
¶2. (SBU) UNHCR has contingency plans to accommodate large 
numbers of refugees from the conflict should the need arise, 
and is readying food and emergency health and hygiene kits in 
its two transit camps, Nkamira and Nyagatare (in Gisenyi and 
Cyangugu, respectively).  Each has adequate water supplies. 
Following recent operations to transfer persons from the two 
transit camps to refugee camps farther inside Rwanda, each 
camp is currently empty, and could hold up to 5,000 persons. 
Nyabiheke camp in the Eastern Province is undergoing 
expansion, and could be used for any overflow, but UNHCR 
prefers for the moment not to transfer any persons there 
until the completion of an on-going "verification" of the 
camp's residents.  UNHCR officials based in Kigali report 
difficulty obtaining up-to-date information, and will travel 
to Gisenyi October 30 to observe the situation for themselves.
