SUBJECT: OCTOBER 16 AMCONSULATE MONTERREY EAC MEETING 
 
REF: MONTERREY 458 
 
¶1.    (SBU)   At approximately 11:36 a.m. October 16, a series 
of 7 to 8 gunshots, in two bursts, were heard near the 
Consulate.  This gunfire comes in the wake of the weekend 
gunshot/grenade attack on the Consulate by assailants unknown 
(see reftel).  Upon hearing the gunshots, Post Acting RSO 
immediately initiated duck and cover procedures and Consulate 
personnel remained in that mode until it the all-clear was 
determined.  Due to the uncertainty surrounding this incident, 
Consul General temporarily suspended services to the public and 
released non-essential employees early on a staggered basis. 
Post is set to resume normal operations at OOB Friday, October 
¶17. The Emergency Action Committee met on October 16 at 1600 in 
the Consulate building, and was attended by the CG, Acting RSO, 
Cons, Econ/Pol, PA, MGT, GSO, CLO, FCS, FAS, ACS, Embassy RSO, 
DHS, DEA, FBI, and ATF. 
 
¶2.   (SBU)   At the EAC, Acting RSO briefed on efforts to date 
to ascertain the source of the gunshots.  Footage from security 
cameras covering the highway failed to reveal anything unusual; 
however tapes from buildings adjacent to the Consulate are being 
reviewed as well.  A search of the Consulate's premises did not 
uncover any new bullet holes or bullet fragments.  In response 
to post's request to the Nuevo Leon state Attorney General for 
increased police protection, the State provided additional 
security.  Three SWAT teams are now located at both the front 
and back of the Consulate and more guards have been stationed 
along the private road leading to the back gate of the building. 
 
¶3.   (SBU)  The October 16 incident at the Consulate followed an 
early morning raid by the Mexican army.  That enforcement action 
resulted in the seizure of 8 tons of marijuana, 21 grenades, 
approximately 20,000 rounds of ammunition, and one arrest. 
Shortly thereafter, Mexican law enforcement authorities engaged 
in a gun-battle with suspected organized crime elements in a 
house in the up-scale Monterrey neighborhood of Contry.  The 
incident at the Consulate occurred shortly after the incident at 
Contry. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)   EAC agreed to issue a warden notice informing local 
Amcits of this new incident. Local television and radio ran 
extensive coverage on the situation at the Consulate, with 
cameramen providing close-up shots of the additional police 
units posted at the building.  The reporting on the Consulate 
was juxtaposed with the gun battle at Contry.  Consul General 
requested Agency/Section heads to brief their Amcit/LES staff 
(as well as family members) on the latest developments, post's 
security posture, and the need for vigilance in both work and 
home routines.  Post is also requesting a timely visit from the 
Mexico City RMO/P. 
 
¶5.   (U)   Post will continue to monitor developments closely.
