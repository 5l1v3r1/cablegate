REF: STATE 108855 
 
¶1.  (U)  This is an action request.  Please see para 3. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On October 14, poloffs delivered reftel demarche to 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade Development Cooperation 
Division's Jong-ho Kyun.  Kyun noted that Deputy Minister for 
Multilateral, Global and Legal Affairs Oh Joon, who headed 
the ROK delegation at June 2008 Donor's Conference in Paris, 
declared USD 30 million in economic support for Afghanistan 
for the next three years.  Although no specific amount is 
earmarked for the 2009-2010 Afghan elections, the ROKG 
assistance would come from this pool of USD 30 million.  Kyun 
shared that a ROK survey team, made up of more than ten ROKG 
officials from MOFAT, Ministry of National Defense and other 
agencies, is scheduled to visit Kabul in early November for a 
week.  The survey team's findings, as well as responses to 
the ROKG inquiries indicated in para 3, will contribute to 
the final ROKG decision regarding election assistance, Kyun 
said. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  The ROKG requested prompt USG response to the 
following inquiries: 
 
-- Who are other donor countries and what is their donation 
amount? 
-- Are there any conditions attached to their donation? 
-- Is the USG contribution toward election assistance made 
bilaterally or is it deposited in the UNDP?
