     ¶B. UN S/PRST/2008/40 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: UN Peacekeeping U/SYG Le Roy said in two 
recent meetings an immediate political solution was needed to 
end hostilities in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), 
and that MONUC required additional resources to protect 
civilians.  Le Roy believed if Goma fell MONUC would be at 
risk throughout the DRC.  The advance of rebel CNDP forces 
towards Goma, which ended in a unilateral ceasefire October 
29, uprooted up to 250,000 IDPs who now need immediate 
humanitarian assistance.  Le Roy said DRC 
troops (FARDC) crumbled in the face of the CNDP attacks and 
FARDC elements attacked MONUC positions and looted places in 
Goma following their collapse.  The Security Council issued a 
strong Presidential Statement calling for a permanent 
ceasefire and a return to dialogue.   END SUMMARY 
 
DPKO BRIEFS UNSC, IF GOMA FALLS, "PRAY" 
 
¶2. (SBU) UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) 
Under-Secretary-General Alain Le Roy briefed the P3 2 
(Belgium and South Africa) on October 28 and the Security 
Council on October 28 and 29 on the escalating crisis in 
eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).  Le Roy noted the 
UN Operation in the DRC (MONUC) would be at risk if Goma were 
to fall, saying the city's fall would lead citizens 
throughout the country to turn on MONUC forces.  When Le Roy 
asked the P3 2 what should be done if Goma fell, only South 
African PermRep Kumalo responded, with just one word, "pray." 
 
MONUC NEEDS HELP-"WE NEED DRC AND RWANDA TO TALK" 
 
¶3. (SBU) Le Roy also said MONUC was "stretched to the limit" 
and was being attacked on all sides.  He called for nations 
to explore DRC President Kabila's request for a 
multi-national force (MNF).  That said, he noted and Council 
members agreed that only a political solution would bring 
lasting peace.  He asked Council members to apply pressure to 
all parties, especially President Kabila and Rwandan 
President Kagame, to cease fire and return to the Goma and 
Nairobi agreements.  UNSYG Ban was exploring the option of 
naming a Special Envoy for the region, Le Roy said.  Kagame 
told Ban he was not prepared to meet with Kabila, but would 
send his foreign minister to Kinshasa for discussions, 
according to Le Roy.  Le Roy noted Ban would continue to 
press for the two presidents to meet. 
 
MONUC WILL ASK FOR MORE TROOPS, SENEGALESE TO HEAD FORCES 
 
¶4. (SBU) Le Roy reiterated SRSG Doss' call for additional 
resources, (Ref. A) including two light infantry battalions, 
two formed police units, two special forces companies, air 
transport abilities, and increased intelligence.  (NOTE: 
While Doss mentioned this request during his October 6 
briefing to the Security Council, MONUC has yet to present a 
formal request for additional troops.   Ambassador DiCarlo 
reiterated the need for a formal request to Le Roy in the 
margins of the October 29 briefing.  He replied that DPKO 
would present a letter to the Council soon.  END NOTE.)  In 
the P3 2 meeting Le Roy said Senegalese General Gaye would be 
the interim replacement for Force Commander Diaz, who 
tendered his resignation for "personal reasons" after only 
three weeks in the DRC. 
 
CROSS-BORDER FIRE, DID RWANDA TRAIN CNDP? FARDC COLLAPSES 
 
¶5. (SBU) Le Roy noted the Rwandan government confirmed its 
forces shelled positions inside the DRC in response to DRC 
shelling Rwanda.  Le Roy also said the new guerilla tactics 
used by the CNDP were very hard for MONUC to combat, and he 
thought these tactics most likely were taught to the CNDP by 
the Rwandan military.  FARDC commanders, Le Roy noted, 
abandoned their posts or lost control of their troops quickly 
following the CNDP attacks.  Alarmingly, FARDC troops were 
looting, shooting at MONUC, and harassing civilians, Le Roy 
said. 
 
HUGE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS 
 
¶6. (SBU) Le Roy noted more than 250,000 internally displaced 
persons (IDPs) were in the Goma region, and another 250,000 
IDPs were expected if the fighting continued.  Goma was being 
flooded by IDPs, and this scale of need would require a 
massive NGO response.  Le Roy said both CNDP and FARDC 
elements were hampering relief workers access to those in 
need. 
 
SC ACTIONS-(WEAK) PRESS REMARKS, THEN A STRONGER PRST 
 
¶7. (SBU) On October 28, all Council members called on the 
President of the Security Council, currently China, to make 
remarks to the press condemning the recent attacks by the 
CNDP and calling for General Nkunda to cease offensive 
operations.  The Council assumed Chinese PermRep Zhang would 
follow the agreed upon remarks, and members expressed 
surprised and disappointment when Zhang removed all specific 
references to the rebel groups and the FARDC during his press 
statement.  On October 29, the Council 
issued a Presidential Statement (PRST) specifically 
condemning the recent CNDP offensive. (Ref. B)  The PRST 
expressed concern at the cross-border heavy weapons fire, and 
called on all regional governments to diffuse tensions and 
cease support of armed groups.  It also called on MONUC to 
take robust action to protect civilians at risk.
