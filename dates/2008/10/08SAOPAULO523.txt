Taking the crisis seriously 
 
Lead editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (10/01) says: 
"While President George Bush negotiates a new bailout package for 
the financial sector with the [U.S.] Congress, the Brazilian 
government should take two attitudes: first, root for success of 
these negotiations, since without a planned official intervention, 
the crisis will last longer, bailout operations will be less 
efficient and the correction will be more painful not only for the 
U.S., but worldwide, including Brazil; second, leave out the oratory 
and study, with realism, a way to face the challenges without 
disturbing the national economy. At this moment, it is more prudent 
to forget the optimism... The challenge now is not to make Brazil an 
island of prosperity, but to facilitate the accommodation of the 
economy." 
 
More power for Correa 
 
Editorial in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (10/01) comments: "President 
Rafael Correa received last Sunday, with a large majority, the 
approval of the new Ecuadorian Constitution.... The issue now is to 
know if in practice the Constitution will be a dictatorial tool in 
the hands of Correa.... It is highly risky to politicize the 
institutions and guardianship of the executive over other powers, as 
is occurring in Venezuela and threatens to happen in Bolivia under 
Morales.  In the area of economics, nothing guarantees that 
contracts will be respected.  An untimely action of Correa against 
the Brazilian contractor Odebrecht is a good example.  ... For now, 
Correa's nationalist platform is benefitting from high oil 
valuations, which provides social programs and accelerates public 
expenditures.  However, it is not known yet how the new 
South-American populism would face a hypothetical situation, more 
and more feasible, of lower of fossil fuel prices."
