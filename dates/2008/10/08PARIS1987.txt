¶1. Embassy met with Eurotradia International Services Division Chief 
Charles de Montesquieu (Tel: +33 1 40 76 26 50; 
email:cdemontesquieu@eurotradia.fr) for clarification of subject 
shipment. 
¶2. Montesquieu informed us that Eurotradia (established as Office 
Generale de l'Aeronautique I 1920) is 77.9 percent owned by six 
stockholder companies:  Total, Thales, EADS, Dassault Aviation, BBDA 
and Snecma/Safran Group.  It provides consulting services in 
addition to acting as a parts and repairs broker, primarily in 
military and civil aviation, but also in energy.  Approximately 95 
percent of its parts and repairs business involves selling French 
components and services outside of France. 
¶3.  In response to the questions proposed (reftel) 
-- End-User Documentation:  Eurotradia staff produced a 
Non-Transfer/End User Certificate (DSP-83) signed by Colonel Deputy 
Director General Purchasing Yahya Yousuf Abdulla Al Baloushi on 
December 12, 2007.  Montesquieu added that under provisions ("DDU") 
of the company's contract with the Abu Dhabi Air Force, Eurotradia 
had to deliver the subject component -- as will all parts -- 
directly to the relevant airbase. 
-- Recordkeeping:  Staff members explained recordkeeping procedures 
for all transactions, including but not limited to arms export 
licensing records.  The company's export licensing officer said that 
subject export item never came under French jurisdiction, but under 
French arms export rules had to be recorded in an "intermediation" 
register that is stored in a safe and is inspected every six months 
by police authorities, after which a copy is sent to the French 
defense export authorities. 
-- Primary Clients:  Montesquieu told us that Eurotradia primarily 
serves the Middle East and Africa, with some clients in Asia and the 
Americas.  Its six biggest customers are Abu Dhabi, Pakistan, 
Kuwait, Jordan, Cameroon and Qatar military entities.  Sales since 
January 1, 2008 amount to 32 million euros, over 7 million of which 
were to the Abu Dhabi Air Force. 
-- Familiarity with U.S. Export Control Rules:  Although Montesquieu 
said Eurotradia rarely handles parts from outside of France, his 
staff clearly understood that they would not have been able to 
formally place their order with the U.S. supplier, Defense 
Technology Equipment, without producing a valid DSP-83. 
Montesquieu, who has previously worked in Washington DC noted that 
Eurotradia has a small office in Washington DC that bids on French 
military procurement contracts issued via the French Embassy, 
largely for C-130 parts.
