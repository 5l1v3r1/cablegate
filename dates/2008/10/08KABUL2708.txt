SUBJECT:  Initial Phase of Voter Registration Faces Tenuous Security 
Situation 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  With the commencement of voter registration just 
one day away - Oct.6, the Independent Election Commission (IEC) is 
struggling to address a number of issues that illustrate the fragile 
and fluid security situation that could undermine the registration 
process in some areas.  The IEC has recognized the need for a 
Command and Control Center to coordinate security support, promote 
quick response and provide broad situational awareness.  The IEC is 
also exploring options for air transport of materials to some 
areas. 
 
Attack on Truck Highlights Uncertain Security Environment 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) At a September 28 security meeting, Dr. Daoud Ali Najafi, 
the IEC Chief Electoral Officer, reported a September 27 attack on a 
truck carrying voter registration materials.  Najafi alleged "local 
Taliban" attacked the truck in Gul Sala, Chapa Dara district, Kunar 
province.  It was traveling without an Afghan National Police (ANP) 
escort to Nuristan to deliver 25 registration material kits for 
50,000 voters.  The truck was detained and the materials burned. 
The truck and driver were not harmed and tribal elders reportedly 
negotiated their release. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Specific details of this incident remain unconfirmed and 
some reports are contradictory - including whether or not an ANP 
escort was requested.  Although this is the first attack on a truck 
delivering registration materials, drivers in a number of areas have 
previously refused to transport materials without an ANP escort out 
of concerns for themselves and their families.  Many have reportedly 
received death threats. 
 
Poor Coordination Hinders VR Process 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶4. (SBU) Faulty communication and coordination between IEC and the 
Ministry of Interior (MOI) also plague the process and undermine 
coordination on security issues.  For example, representatives from 
MOD, NDS, and ISAF attended the Sept. 28 security meeting, but the 
MOI representative was notably absent.  The IEC is operating in an 
accelerated mode due to the pressures of preparing for the Oct. 6 
opening of the VR process, resulting in last minute or ill-prepared 
requests to the MOI.  MOI also shares responsibility for the current 
situation through its prior unresponsiveness to IEC requests and 
failure to demonstrate consistent commitment to coordination on VR 
preparations.  Considerable efforts by the international community 
are ongoing to promote improved coordination, support capacity 
building and keep the process on track. 
 
IEC Recognizes the Need for Command and Control Center 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶5. (SBU) A functioning IEC operations center staffed by experienced 
personnel might have staved off this particular security incident by 
coordinating security and logistical support for the registration 
process and serving as a central communications point, including a 
direct communication link with MOI.  The international community 
(IC) has long stressed the importance of establishing such a Command 
and Control Center, but the IEC has not given this priority 
attention.  The IEC also has a growing awareness of its own security 
vulnerabilities; credible threats have been made against the IEC 
compound and additional steps are underway bye the IEC and IC 
stakeholders to address those threats and implement additional 
safeguards.  The IEC now recognizes the importance of establishing a 
Command and Control Center.  There is not yet a timeline for 
establishing this Control Center or a process for identifying 
trained staff, but swift implementation is key and the IC will 
support this effort as much as possible. 
 
IEC Submits Last-Minute Requests for Air Transport 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Dr. Najafi predicts the security situation will worsen with 
the opening of the voter registration, especially in certain

insecure provinces such as Ghazni, Wardak, Kunar, Logar, and 
Nuristan where Provincial Election and District Field Officers have 
resigned after receiving death threats from anti-government 
elements.   The IEC is considering various options for the secure 
transport of registration materials - particularly the use of air 
assets.
