SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On April 24, the Sao Paulo State Executive Committee of 
the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) voted unanimously to 
support Sao Paulo incumbent Mayor Gilberto Kassab (Democratic Party 
- DEM) in this year's municipal elections.  PMDB state president 
Orestes Quercia stated that national politics drove the decision. 
Quercia deems it essential to defeat the Lula/Workers' Party (PT) 
administration in 2010 and believes that an alliance with Kassab, a 
political protege of Sao Paulo Governor Jose Serra (Social Democracy 
Party of Brazil - PSDB), who is currently considered the frontrunner 
for president, sets them up to achieve that goal.  However, the PMDB 
is a diffuse, fragmented entity in which regional "caciques" like 
Quercia have considerable autonomy, making the impact of this local 
alliance on the national PMDB, a major partner in President Lula's 
governing coalition, unclear.  At the local level, the surprise 
announcement represents a serious disappointment to Mayor Kassab's 
two principal opponents, former Governor Geraldo Alckmin (PSDB) and 
Tourism Minister Marta Suplicy (PT), both of whom had avidly courted 
Quercia in pursuit of PMDB support.  It also significantly increases 
Kassab's profile in the 2008 mayoral election and turns him from a 
definite third place finisher into a contender in his own right. 
End Summary.

PMDB SUPPORT BRINGS TV TIME 
--------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) PMDB support of Kassab comes with a price.  In return for 
the endorsement of Kassab, the Democratic Party pledged to support 
Quercia's 2010 bid for a Senate seat.  The question of Kassab's 
running mate was left open to allow flexibility in negotiations 
aimed at bringing Governor Serra's PSDB into the alliance.  However, 
if he is unable to win over the PSDB, Kassab is expected to choose 
Quercia's PMDB designee, Alda Marco Antonio, to fill out the 
ticket. 
 
¶3.  (U) The PMDB, a major national party with a prestigious history, 
is not, by itself, an important force in Sao Paulo state or city 
politics.   The party has only five of 70 state federal deputies, 
three of 94 state legislators, and two of 55 City Council members, 
and has not elected a Governor since 1990.  Running as the party's 
gubernatorial candidate in 2006, Quercia garnered only 4.6 percent 
of the vote.  The PMDB, however, does sometimes act as spoiler or 
kingmaker between the two major contenders, PT and PSDB, at the 
state and local level.  Of particular importance to Kassab is the 
amount of television advertising time the PMDB can use in the 
upcoming elections.  As the party that elected the largest number of 
federal deputies nationwide in 2006, the PMDB commands the largest 
bloc of free television and radio advertising time this year.  A 
PMDB-DEM coalition will be entitled to almost eight minutes (out of 
a total of 25) of free advertising, afternoon and evening, three 
days a week during the 45-day advertising season (August-September) 
leading up to the elections.  This is almost twice as much 
advertising time as either the PT or PSDB.  Polls have consistently 
shown Kassab running third behind Alckmin (PSDB) and Suplicy (PT), 
both of whom are nationally known figures.   Up to now, the Mayor 
has been considered a second-tier candidate.  However, the alliance 
with the PMDB is a dramatic sign that Kassab has no intention of 
fading away.  When added to the advantages of incumbency and control 
of the municipal apparatus, the free advertising time that comes 
with PMDB support makes Kassab a force to reckon with.

ISOLATING THE OPPONENTS 
----------------------- 
 
¶4.  (U) The PT had been negotiating aggressively for PMDB support 
for Marta Suplicy's candidacy and was evidently taken by surprise by 
the sudden shift.  The PMDB is a partner in President Lula's 
governing coalition, holding six Cabinet positions, and the two 
parties are electoral allies this year in a number of major cities. 
PT national electoral strategy calls for strengthening state and 
local ties with the PMDB as a prelude to the 2010 election.  The PT 
and Suplicy are now reduced to looking for support among several 
smaller parties.  However, even the PT's natural ideological allies 
among the small, leftist parties are in doubt, as many are talking 
about running their own "Left Bloc" candidate. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The real loser and victim in this affair, however, is 
Geraldo Alckmin.  From the beginning (reftels), Alckmin has been 
running against the wishes of a significant portion of his own 
party.  Led by Governor Serra, this faction prefers to maintain the 
traditional PSDB-DEM alliance by supporting Mayor Kassab's 
re-election.  (Note: Serra was elected Mayor in 2004 with Kassab as 
his running mate.  Kassab became Mayor in 2006 when Serra resigned 
to run for Governor.  He kept much of Serra's team in place.  End 
Note.)  While numerous PSDB leaders, including Serra himself, have 
stated publicly that Alckmin will be their party's Mayoral candidate 
if he wants to be, it has become evident that their support for him 
will be grudging at best.  Most political observers see the 
Quercia-Kassab alliance as a behind-the-scenes maneuver by Serra to 
isolate and demoralize Alckmin in the hopes of convincing him to 
give up his candidacy.  However, Alckmin instead responded by 
reiterating his intention to run.  Fernando Braga, an Alckmin 
advisor, acknowledged to Poloff that Mayor Kassab's new-found 
support will make Alckmin's task more difficult, but saw no sign 
that Alckmin was thinking of quitting.  In a tumultuous May 5 
meeting, the PSDB's local Executive Committee voted to nominate 
Alckmin, but a significant 
minority expressed vocal opposition and vowed to continue to push 
for the party to support Kassab and preserve the alliance with the 
DEMs.

QUERCIA EXPLAINS

¶6.  (U) In a full-page interview published April 30 in Folha de S. 
Paulo, Orestes Quercia explained why, faced with a choice, he 
decided to unite the PMDB's forces with Mayor Kassab and the 
Democratic Party.  "Above all I think the country needs to change 
the PT government.  And today there's only one alternative to defeat 
the Lula government, and that is the [presidential] candidacy of 
Jose Serra.  Since the municipal election has this objective of 
strengthening a presidential candidacy, I decided to take a position 
that would benefit the Democrats and their alliance with Serra." 
Like many others, Quercia believes that Alckmin should withdraw his 
Mayoral candidacy and run for Governor in 2010 with PSDB, DEM, and 
PMDB support.  He believes Minas Gerais Governor Aecio Neves (PSDB) 
would not be as strong a presidential candidate as Serra, and is 
skeptical of rumors that Neves may switch to the PMDB.  "The PMDB is 
a very divided party.  It would be a very large risk for him." 
Quercia heaped scorn on Lula and the PT - "The government has to 
change because it doesn't have the competence to govern...it's just 
surfing on a wave" - and on his own party: "The PMDB doesn't 
participate in the process of the economy, of the government, 
nothing.  It went chasing after positions [in the government], it 
 
SAO PAULO 00000225  003 OF 003 
 
 
became the party that only thinks about positions." 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Claudio Lembo, a DEM leader who served as Geraldo 
Alckmin's Lieutenant Governor, told Poloff that even though Quercia 
and the PMDB are not major players in Sao Paulo, the deal gives 
Mayor Kassab a big boost.  "If Marta Suplicy had that TV time, she'd 
be almost impossible to beat, with her support from the masses," he 
said.  Mayor Kassab, he said, lacks charisma and so far hasn't 
connected well with the voters, but he works hard and has a good 
record to run on, and the TV time will help him significantly. 
Lembo, who participated in the negotiations, said the real benefit 
of the alliance is to sew up Sao Paulo - Brazil's most populous 
state, with about 22 percent of the nation's voters - for Serra in 
2010, if Kassab can win in Sao Paulo this year.  Lembo also noted 
that the agreement exacerbates the split within the PSDB between the 
supporters of Alckmin's mayoral candidacy and those who want to 
support Kassab and preserve the PSDB-DEM alliance.  He predicted 
that Alckmin will not abandon the race but that those who oppose his 
candidacy will keep the pressure on him and may openly challenge him 
at the party's convention in June, leading to a floor fight.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶8.  (SBU) It is not clear that the support of Quercia and the Sao 
Paulo PMDB for Kassab and thus for Serra's presidential bid will 
help Serra significantly or serve as a model for other states where 
such an alliance might be replicated.  Orestes Quercia is not a 
well-loved or admired figure in Sao Paulo politics.  Twenty years 
ago, when Quercia was Governor, a group of Sao Paulo PMDB leaders 
became so disenchanted with his iron grip on the state party 
machinery and his alleged unethical conduct in office that they 
bolted the party and joined with disaffected PMDB members elsewhere 
to form a new party, the PSDB.  These prominent renegades included 
(among others) former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, former 
Sao Paulo Governors Mario Covas and Geraldo Alckmin, and Jose Serra. 
 The defection of so much political talent is one reason the Sao 
Paulo PMDB remains weak to this day.  Nonetheless, Quercia's move 
turns Kassab from an also-ran -- he has been languishing well behind 
Suplicy and Alckmin in the polls -- into a serious contender for Sao 
Paulo mayor.  Defeating the popular Suplicy in October would create 
an additional hurdle to Lula's and the PT's 2010 ambitions.  End 
Comment.
