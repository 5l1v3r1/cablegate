1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Regional Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) 
conducted a post shipment-verification (PSV) at International 
Aerospace Tubes Asia, IAT, 32 Loyang Drive, Singapore (IAT). The 
item in question is one case of Nextel braided sleeving exported to 
IAT on or about September 15, 2007 and valued at USD 5,400.  The 
item is classified under Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) 
1C010 and is controlled for national security (NS) and nuclear 
nonproliferation (NP) reasons.  The exporter was 3M of St. Paul, 
Minnesota. 
 
¶3.  IAT is an affiliate of Pratt & Whitney (67% shareholder) and SIA 
Engineering Company (33% shareholder).  It specializes in the repair 
of aerospace tubes and manifolds for PW4000 engines. More 
information is available at www.siaec.com.sg. 
¶4.  On April 23, 2008, the ECO, accompanied by a representative of 
Singapore Customs visited the company and met with Mr. Wong, Chow 
Mein, Senior Materials & Purchasing Coordinator.  Mr. Wong confirmed 
that IAT had received a copy of the export license conditions (as 
required in the license).  He also stated that the item was being 
used in the repair of aircraft engines.  He took the ECO to the 
production floor and showed the ECO parts that were being repaired 
with the item.  Most of the sleeving had been used in prior 
repairs. 
 
¶5.  At the time visited, IAT appeared to be a suitable recipient of 
the commodities shipped since IAT cooperated with the PSV, provided 
ECO with access to the item and operates a line of business 
consistent with the item's use.  Also, IAT was informed of the 
applicable license conditions and indicated its intent to comply 
with the conditions and U.S. export controls more generally.
