Article in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (5/6) says: "The 
approval of the autonomy referenda was the way six out of the nine 
provinces that make up Bolivia found to force the central government 
to revise the constitutional project...[that]  increases the power 
of the central government...and withdraws it from the provinces.... 
With the referenda, the opposition intends to obtain some political 
advantage that goes beyond achieving administrative autonomy. The 
main one is to isolate the central government and force it to 
negotiate structural reforms.... Both sides must be willing to 
negotiate to overcome the impasse they created."
