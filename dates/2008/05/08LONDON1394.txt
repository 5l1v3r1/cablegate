SUBJECT: UPDATE ON EMBASSY LONDON PLANS FOR DAY OF 
SOLIDARITY WITH THE CUBAN PEOPLE 
 
REF: A. LONDON 1265 B. STATE 51536 C. STATE 45792 D. STATE 46997 
 
¶1. Per ref A, "The Daily Telegraph" has agreed to run the 
Department-cleared op-ed under the Ambassador's signature in 
its online version on May 21. 
 
¶2. In addition, Embassy London is working with the NGO 
"English PEN" to mark the occasion. PEN advocates for 
freedom of expression around the world and calls attention to 
the plight of persecuted and imprisoned writers. PEN is 
interested in hosting a roundtable to brief embassies and 
think tanks about the lack of freedom of expression and the 
plight of those imprisoned in Cuba for expressing their 
opinions. Unfortunately due to staffing problems, PEN does 
not believe it will be able to organize this event this week, 
but is aiming for the week of May 26. We will continue to 
assist PEN in firming up this event. 
 
¶3. FCO contacts have reiterated that HMG plans to keep a low 
profile on Cuba leading up the sensitive June EU meeting in 
which the EU common position will be discussed.
