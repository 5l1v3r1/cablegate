REF: STATE 45792 
 
(SBU) Post has determined that it is not feasible to organize 
local events to mark the "Day of Solidarity with Cuba" in 
Oman due to the lack of awareness or interest among Omanis 
about Cuban affairs (Cuba has no diplomatic presence in 
Oman), the absence of non-governmental partners with which to 
conduct joint programming, and government controls on the 
press that limit public discussion of human rights and 
democracy.  Post will, however, inform the government of USG 
activities on May 21 to mark the event.
