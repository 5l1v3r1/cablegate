¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Regional Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) 
conducted a post shipment-verification (PSV) at Hitech Heat 
Treatment Services Pte. Ltd., 57 Joo Koon Circle, Singapore 
(Hitech). The item in question is one absolute pressure transducer 
exported to Hitech on or about October 10, 2007.  The item is 
classified under Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) 2B230 
and is controlled for nuclear nonproliferation reasons (NP).  The 
exporter was MKS Instruments Inc. or Andover, Massachusetts. 
 
¶3.  According to the Singapore companies registry, Hitech was 
registered in 1991 and its registered share capital is the Singapore 
 
dollar equivalent of approximately USD 1.25 million.  Its directors 
are Malaysia national, Oan, Kim Eng and Singapore citizen, Yio Oon 
Koon and Singapore permanent resident, Lim Tien Hwa.  Messrs Lim and 
Yio are are also the shareholders of the company. 
 
¶4.  A review of the company's web site (www.hitech.sg) reveals that 
the company specializes in providing heat treatment services to a 
range of manufacturing sectors including aerospace, power 
generation, military, electronics, etc.  Its services include Vacuum 
heat treatment, protective atmosphere heat treatment, plasma surface 
treatment as well as cryogenic treatment, among others. 
 
¶5.  On April 21, 2008, the ECO, accompanied by a representative of 
Singapore Customs visited the company and met with Mr. Wilfredo 
Linao, Plant Superintendent.  Mr. Linao provided a brief description 
of the company consistent with the information on the company's web 
site. 
 
¶6.  As to the particular item in question, Mr. Linao confirmed that 
the company had received the transducer and was using it on a Fours 
BMI furnace.  Mr. Linao provided the ECO with documentation 
confirming receipt.  Mr. Linao then took the ECO to the plant floor 
where the ECO was able to inspect the item on the back of the 
furnace.  Mr. Linao also confirmed that the company has received the 
applicable license conditions from the exporter (MKS). 
 
¶7.  At the time visited, Hitech appeared to be a suitable recipient 
of the commodities shipped since Hitech cooperated with the PSV, 
provided ECO with access to the item and related documents and 
operates a line of business consistent with the use of the items. 
Also, Hitech is familiar with the applicable license conditions and 
expressed its commitment to comply with them.
