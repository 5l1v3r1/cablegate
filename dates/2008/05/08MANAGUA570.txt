SUBJECT: NICARAGUA: MFA NON-COMMITTAL ON PRISONERS OF 
CONSCIENCE DECLARATION 
 
REF: SECSTATE 40380 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul Trivelli for reasons 1.4(b, d) 
 
¶1.  (C) On May 6, poloff delivered reftel demarche to 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials Mario Barquero, 
Director for the Non-Aligned Movement, and Renee Morales, 
Director for North American Affairs.  While neither was 
familiar with the draft declaration itself, Barquero 
immediately recognized the unstated Cuban human rights 
subtext and smugly raised the issue of USG treatment of 
Guantanamo detainees.  In the ensuing decussion, Barquero 
gave no indication of either support or opposition to the 
declaration's basic points, but did agree to discuss with the 
GON's UN representatives. 
 
COMMENT

¶2.  (C) Although this declaration seeks to take a thematic 
approach to the issue of prisoners of conscience, given 
President Daniel Ortega's close personal ties to Cuba, there 
is little chance that the GON will support this initiative. 
This was made clear by Barquero's poorly concealed smirk when 
we brought up the declaration and asked for GON support.
