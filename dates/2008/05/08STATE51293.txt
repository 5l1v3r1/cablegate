SUBJECT: TRAVEL ALERT - ZIMBABWE 
 
 
¶1.  This Travel Alert is being issued to update U.S. 
citizens on safety and security concerns throughout 
Zimbabwe due to ongoing political instability following the 
March 29 national elections, and recommends deferral of 
non-essential travel to Zimbabwe at this time.  This 
supersedes the Travel Alert for Zimbabwe dated April 11, 
2008 and expires on July 1, 2008. 
 
¶2.  U.S. citizens should defer non-essential travel to 
Zimbabwe.  While the country prepares for a runoff of the 
presidential elections between President Robert Mugabe and 
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) candidate Morgan 
Tsvangirai, Zimbabwean security forces, including some 
military and police, as well as so-called war veterans, are 
creating a climate of intimidation and fear across the 
country, particularly in rural areas and high-density 
suburbs.  There have been attacks on opposition supporters, 
renewed farm invasions, and arrests of election officials 
accused of vote tampering.  There is a continued risk of 
arbitrary detention or arrest. 
 
¶3.  Americans should be particularly cautious when using 
still, video or telephone cameras in any urban setting, or 
in the vicinity of any political activity, as this could be 
construed by Zimbabwean authorities as practicing 
journalism without accreditation, a crime punishable by 
arrest, incarceration and/or deportation. 
 
¶4.  American citizens traveling to or resident in Zimbabwe 
should register with the U.S. Embassy by completing a 
registration form online at 
https://travelregistration.state.gov.  Registration enables 
the Embassy to contact American citizens in case of 
emergency and provide updates on the security situation. 
 
¶5.  As the Department of State continues to develop 
information on any potential security threats to U.S. 
citizens overseas, it shares credible threat information 
through its consular information program documents, 
available on the Internet at http://travel.state.gov.  In 
addition to information on the Internet, travelers may 
obtain up-to-date information on security conditions by 
calling 1-888-407-4747 toll-free in the U.S. or outside the 
U.S. and Canada on a regular toll line at 1-202-501-4444. 
 
¶6.  Minimize considered.
