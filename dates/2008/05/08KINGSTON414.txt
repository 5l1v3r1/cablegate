End Summary. 
 
2.(SBU)  Prime Minister (PM) Bruce Golding, accompanied by Mrs. 
Golding, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and 
Foreign Trade Ken Baugh, Minister of Tourism Ed Bartlett, Minister 
of Health Ruddy Spencer, Minister of Water and Housing Horace Chang, 
and Minister of Agriculture Chris Tufton, visited Havana May 5 - 7. 
This was the largest government delegation to leave the country 
since Golding's Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) took office in September, 
Â¶2007.  The PM is believed to be the first Caribbean leader to have 
an official face-to-face meeting with Raul Castro since he assumed 
the Presidency.  They reportedly met at the Palace of the 
Revolution, followed by a wreath-laying ceremony at the Jose Marti 
monument.  The delegation also reportedly visited two eye surgery 
hospitals in which many Jamaicans receive treatment, the Information 
Sciences University, and a green house agricultural complex. 
 
Agriculture, health, tourism, water resources, and housing 
agreements 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
3.(SBU)  The Jamaican delegation signed framework agreements for 
bilateral cooperation in the areas of agriculture, health, tourism, 
water resources, and housing.  Speaking on the afternoon of May 5, 
Golding reportedly said that "one of the areas to be explored is the 
possibility of multiple destination marketing where visitors can 
purchase a package through which they could spend some time in 
Jamaica and some time in Cuba."  Details of the tourism agreement 
reportedly will be worked out by Bartlett with his Cuban 
counterpart.  In agriculture, cooperation reportedly is envisioned 
in greenhouse technology.  The PM also reportedly said the two 
countries have agreed to further talks to protect their territorial 
waters from drug smugglers. 
 
Golding reiterates call for lifting of U.S. embargo, constructive 
U.S. engagement with Cuba 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
4.(SBU)  According to the Jamaica Observer newspaper, Golding "gave 
a commitment to encourage the American Government to pursue a path 
of constructive engagement with the Cuban Government, similar to 
what has been adapted (sic) with communist China and Vietnam.  He 
said the U.S. was prepared to engage constructively with China and 
Vietnam, and the time has come for constructive engagement with 
Cuba."  Speaking at an airport press conference upon his return to 
Kingston, the PM said: "We gave them (Cuban Government) an assurance 
that not only would we continue to support that view, but that we 
would use whatever influence we have, however limited, to seek to 
encourage and influence the thinking of the U.S. Government towards 
a different approach to Cuba."  According to the Gleaner newspaper, 
while in Havana Golding said that "he believed the lifting of the 
U.S. embargo on Cuba was imminent." 
 
JLP Government to continue longstanding bilateral cooperation 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
5.(SBU)  Historically in Jamaica, JLP Governments generally have 
been less sympathetic to the Cuban regime that those of the 
opposition People's National Party (PNP).  This was particularly 
true when Edward Seaga succeeded Michael Manley as PM during the 
early 1980s.  Indeed ironically, Golding himself was a prominent 
Minister in the newly-elected Seaga Government when it declared 
Cuban Ambassador Ulisses Estrada persona non grata.  As noted in the 
local press, the PM's recent visit to Havana is to some extent an 
effort to "bury the Seaga-era Cuban policy."  Golding also sought to 
allay any concerns by the Cubans that the Government of Jamaica

might somehow hold them responsible for a recent scandal surrounding 
the distribution of Cuban light bulbs, in which one senior Jamaican 
official has been indicted on corruption charges (reftel B). By 
septel, we will provide further analysis and comment on Golding's 
trip and its implications for U.S.-Jamaican relations.
