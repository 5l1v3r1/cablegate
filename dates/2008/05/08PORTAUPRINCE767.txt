¶1. (SBU) Summary:  The Government of Haiti values the 
assistance it receives from Cuba and does not criticize the 
country publicly or privately.  Cuba's provision of doctors 
in hard-to-reach areas of the country is seen positively by 
large sectors of the Haitian public.  After the April food 
riots, the Cuban and Venezuelan Ministers of Agriculture 
visited Haiti to explore providing technical assistance to 
Haitian agriculture.  Post knows of no Haitian investment in 
Cuba.  End summary. 
 
Promotion of Democracy and Human Rights in Cuba 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Government of Haiti does not promote democracy 
or human rights in Cuba.  In its two years in office, the 
government of President Rene Preval does not publicly comment 
on Cuba's human rights or democracy record.  It has kept 
silent on the undemocratic succession of power from Fidel to 
Raul Castro.  This is in keeping with Haiti's practice of not 
commenting adversely in public on governments that provide 
assistance.  There were no demonstrations, public 
announcements nor legislative acts in support of the May 21 
Day of Solidarity with the Cuban people.  Developments in 
Cuba receive very little attention in the Haitian press. 
 
Agreements and Exchanges:  Health and Energy 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Haiti is a member of the Venezuela-Cuba-Haiti 
Tripartite Agreement, which facilitates technical assistance 
to Haiti.  This includes Venezuela and Cuba's building of 
electricity generation plants in the capital, Gonaive, and 
Cap Haitien, and their repair of existing electricity plants, 
as well as Cuba's provision of physicians working in Haiti. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Haitian medical students continue to receive 
scholarships to study in Cuba.  The program began under 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide's second administration (2001-2004). 
Approximately 1,000 Haitians have participated in this 
program.  Haitian officials, including President Preval and 
Chamber of Deputies President Eric Jean Jacques, have 
received medical treatment in Cuba.  Post knows of no 
Haitians engaging in Cuban-paid medical travel to Cuba. 
 
Trade/Investment 
---------------- 
 
¶5. (U) Post is aware of no Haitian public or private 
investment in Cuba, nor Cuban investment in Haiti.  Post is 
aware of no bilateral trade agreements between Haiti and 
Cuba. 
 
High-Level Visits 
----------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Haitian President Rene Preval attended the Fourth 
Petrocaribe Summit held in Cienfuegos, Cuba on December 21, 
¶2007.  A Ministry of Agriculture contact told Econoff that 
the Cuban and Venezuelan Ministers of Agriculture visited 
Haiti in April after the food riots to discuss how each 
country could assist in developing Haiti's agricultural 
sector.
