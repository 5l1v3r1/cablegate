In Today's Papers 
 
The AKP's Roadmap Is To Continue Their Mission 
Radikal, Turkiye, Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Vatan, Cumhuriyet, 
Zaman and others:  Liberal Radikal gives a front-page coverage to PM 
Erdogan's remarks at a dinner sponsored by TESEV, a foundation for 
economic and social research.  Prominent journalists who attended 
the dinner included Ergun Babahan, Mehmet Barlas, Taha Akyol, Hasan 
Cemal, and Cengis Candar.  According to speculation in the press, PM 
Erdogan indicated at the dinner the AKP will "continue the mission," 
even if they are banned by the Constitutional Court.  Mainstream 
Milliyet columnist Fikret Bila lists AKP politicians that could take 
over the duties in the party if Erdogan is banned from politics. 
These names include Ali Babacan, Mehmet Ali Sahin and Cemil Cicek 
because none of these names are listed in the chief prosecutor's 
indictment.  Mainstream Vatan reports that AKP plans to hold early 
elections if Erdogan is banned from politics.  Columnist Bilal Cetin 
of mainstream Vatan writes, "The AKP will adjust its roadmap based 
on the court's decision on whether or not to ban them."  Murat 
Yetkin of liberal Radikal notes, "regardless of what Erdogan does or 
does not do, the mission of the AKP will continue through a new 
party if the AKP is banned."  Okay Gonensin of mainstream Vatan 
writes, "The AKP will not amend the constitution to prevent closure, 
but Erdogan could run as an Independent and thus become the first 
Independent PM."  The press indicates the bottom line is that if AKP 
is banned, they will create a new party in order to continue their 
mission. 
 
Meanwhile, PM Erdogan attended a ceremony in Ankara yesterday on the 
occasion of Foundations Week and said, "Turkish society 
traditionally has the feeling of solidarity in times of crisis," and 
expressed his wish that "Turkey will not go through such periods 
again."  He added, "The economy, the state and society have 
developed in a very concrete way.  Because of cooperation, many 
problems were resolved.  However, Turkey deserves more democracy, 
justice, production and development." 
 
Wounded PKK is Angry with Barzani; PJAK Threatens U.S. Interests in 
Turkey 
Sabah, Milliyet, Vatan, Cumhuriyet, Hurriyet and others: Mainstream 
Milliyet reports that the PKK terrorist organization suffered heavy 
losses during Turkish military operations last week in northern 
Iraq.  Reportedly, the PKK is angry with Kurdish Regional Government 
(KRG) President Massoud Barzani for remaining silent and not 
criticizing the Turkish air strikes.  Sabah and Milliyet report that 
the operations against the PKK continue in Sirnak's Bestler -Dereler 
region.  Operations intensified yesterday following the discovery of 
a group of terrorists' movement in the region.  The Turkish General 
Staff (TGS) web site reported that two terrorists were killed while 
trying to cross the border. 
Meanwhile, Mainstream Hurriyet carried an AP article yesterday on 
its website indicating PJAK threats against U.S. targets in Turkey. 
Under the headline, "The U.S. Sold Us Out," Peritan Derseem, a 
senior official with the PKK's Iranian wing, PEJAK, is quoted as 
saying, "We have changed our stance toward the United States 
government and we are standing against them now," and "Maybe some 
day individual combatants might launch suicide attacks inside Iraq 
and Turkey, and even against American interests." 
 
EDITORIAL OPINION: U.S. Help In The Fight Against The PKK 
 
"Body Bag Deliveries" 
Enis Berberoglu wrote in mainstream Hurriyet (5/6): "There have been 
rumors and expectations about PKK leadership being extradited from 
northern Iraq to Turkey.  Current events, however, indicate that the 
U.S. does not want PKK leadership to be caught alive.  Last year 
when PKK leader Murat Karayilan went to a hospital in Erbil for 
treatment, the U.S. shared this intelligence with Turkey.  However 
later on, the U.S. blocked Karayilan's capture at the hospital.  Now 
a year later, it seems the U.S. has revised its attitude.  When 
 
ANKARA 00000873  002 OF 003 
 
 
Karayilan held a meeting at Kandil Mountain last week, the U.S. 
instantly informed Ankara, and air operations ensued. Thus, the U.S. 
no longer keeps its intelligence reports regarding PKK to itself; on 
the contrary it shares them with Turkey immediately.  It looks like 
the U.S. is prepared to deliver to Turkey PKK leaders packaged in 
body bags.  Both PKK and PJAK are having a hard time realizing this 
and acknowledging the fact that the U.S. has made a clear choice 
between Turkey and the PKK.  The U.S. is on Turkey's side." 
 
"The PKK Is Alienated" 
Mainstream Milliyet's carried this group analysis from its regional 
reporters (5/6): "In its fight against PKK, Ankara has support from 
Washington and Baghdad.  In addition, there is support from Tehran, 
who deals with the PJAK threat.  Now Ankara hopes to complete this 
support chain with the Kurdish Regional Government of northern Iraq 
(KRG).  The KRG kept silent when the Turkish army launched an air 
attack in the Kandil Mountain area last week.  Then, over the 
weekend, KRG President Massoud Barzani, who used to strongly oppose 
cross-border operations, changed his rhetoric.  On Saturday, Barzani 
asked the PKK to abandon violence and begin a dialogue with Turkey. 
The obvious switch in KRG's position created uneasiness within the 
PKK.  PKK figures are now complaining about both Turkey and the KRG. 
 The statements from the PKK also complain about the 
intelligence-sharing mechanism between Turkey and the U.S., and 
about the cooperation against PJAK between Turkey, Iraq and Iran. 
There was speculation about the U.S. giving support to PJAK in its 
efforts against the government of Iran.  However, it seems the U.S. 
does not care for PJAK any longer." 
 
 
DTP Delegation to Meet with Talabani 
All papers report a DTP delegation comprised of Ahmet Turk, Sebahat 
Tuncel, and Kamuran Yuksek will go to Iraq today to request Iraqi 
President Jalal Talabani's support against the Turkish military 
operations in the north.  Papers also report that DTP deputies 
Gulten Kisanak, Aysel Tugluk and Akin Birdal paid a condolence visit 
to a Diyarbakir family of a PKK terrorist who was killed in the 
Turkish air operations in northern Iraq. 
 
Trade Unions Will File Complaints over May Day Incidents 
All major news outlets report leaders of several trade unions 
yesterday held a joint press conference to announce that they would 
seek legal remedies in the face of incidents that occurred on May 
Day.  Liberal Radikal writes in, "Next Year Another Taksim" that, 
"Union leaders are determined to hold May Day celebrations in Taksim 
next year."  Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Cumhuriyet and other papers 
report Suleyman Celebi, the secretary-general of the Confederation 
of Revolutionary Workers' Unions (DISK), Mustafa Turker, the 
secretary-general of the Confederation of Turkish Labor Unions 
(Turk-Is) and Ismail Hakki Tombul, the head of the Confederation of 
Public Sector Trade Unions (KESK), issued a joint statement which 
noted, "The ruling AKP, the governor of Istanbul and the Istanbul 
police chief violated citizens' rights to life and freedom of speech 
and the rights to hold demonstrations and rallies."  They also 
added, "The government does not accept that the police used 
disproportionate force and treated the demonstrators harshly. 
However, the concept of the proportionate use of force is a legal 
term, which is clearly defined in the rulings of the European Court 
of Human Rights." 
 
 
EU Troika Meeting Takes Place in Ankara Today 
All news outlets report on today's meeting between Turkish Foreign 
Minister Ali Babacan and representatives of the EU.  In addition to 
FM Babacan, NTV reports the participants will include Slovenian 
Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel, French State Minister for European 
Affairs Jean Pierre Jouyet, and EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli 
Rehn.  Mainstream Sabah writes, "The focus of the meeting will be on 
the closure case against the AKP, the events on May Day, and union 
rights."  In addition, mainstream Hurriyet notes, "EU members will 
 
ANKARA 00000873  003 OF 003 
 
 
urge Turkey to continue its reforms, Babacan will brief the Troika 
on Turkey's progress in its reforms," and finally, "Cyprus, Iraq, 
and Iran will come to the agenda."  Melih Asik of mainstream 
Milliyet writes, "This meeting is not going to defend democracy, but 
will be the EU's effort to save the AKP."  Columnist Muharrem 
Sarikaya of Sabah writes, "The EU is now preoccupied with security 
and gas," so "issues concerning the Nabucco pipeline will be 
discussed at the meeting."
