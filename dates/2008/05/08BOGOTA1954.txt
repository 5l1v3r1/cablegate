SUMMARY 
------- 

¶1.  (C) The Prosecutor General (Fiscalia) announced it is 
investigating nine individuals, including a U.S. citizen and 
three other foreigners, for alleged ties to the FARC, and has 
also asked the Supreme Court to investigate three Colombian 
legislators.  The investigations result from the Fiscalia's
preliminary analysis of material found in the Raul Reyes 
computers.  The opposition Polo party issued a statement 
supporting three Polo members under investigation; some human 
rights groups claimed the investigations aim to distract 
attention from the ongoing parapolitical scandal. Still, Polo 
Senator Gustavo Petro told us he does not discount the 
possibility that some Polo members maintained inappropriate 
ties with the FARC, proof of which he believes could split 
the Polo apart. End Summary 

FARC-POLITICA INVESTIGATIONS 
---------------------------- 

¶2.  (U) Prosecutor General Mario Iguaran announced May 22 the 
launch of official investigations against twelve individuals 
presumed to have relations with the FARC.  The initial 
evidence for the investigations comes from correspondence 
from the computer files of FARC Secretariat member Raul 
Reyes, killed by Colombian military forces on March 1.  In 
what is dubbed by local media as the first chapter of the 
"Farcpolitica," some individuals are being investigated for 
allegedly providing political advice or arms to the FARC 
while others allegedly knew the locations of kidnapped 
victims but never shared the information with authorities. 


¶3.  (U) Prominent officials under investigation include 
Liberal Party Senator Piedad Cordoba, Polo Democratico (and 
Communist Party) legislators Wilson Borja and Gloria Ines 
Ramirez, former presidential candidate Alvaro Leyva, and 
Communist newspaper editor (and Polo member) Carlos Lozano.
The GOC had, at various times, authorized Lozano, Leyva, 
Cordoba, and Borja to reach out to the FARC to promote a 
humanitarian accord.  Several human rights groups and 
commentators charged the GOC with trying to block all efforts 
to promote a humanitarian exchange.  Others argued that in 
initiating the investigation the GOC is trying to divert 
attention from the ongoing parapolitica scandal which has 
implicated over 50 members of the governing coalition. 

¶4.  (C) Four foreigners - including American citizen James 
Jones - are under investigation as well.  Jones allegedly 
maintained ongoing correspondence with Reyes and worked on 
the FARC's behalf.  In March, Semana magazine published 
excerpts of one of Jones' letters to Reyes, in which he 
offered to serve as a communications "bridge" between the 
FARC and a U.S. Congressman.  Presidential advisor Jose 
ObdulioGaviria told us in February that the GOC was 
considering pursuing criminal charges against Jones, as well 
as U.S. citizen James Petras. 

¶5.  (U) Investigators presented over 900 emails between 
Cordoba (using an alias "Teodora de Bolivar") and different 
FARC contacts.  The Fiscalia reports that the tone and 
content of the Cordoba emails indicate she "exceeded" her 
political role and provided advice and guidance to the FARC. 
Venezuelan Congressman Amilkar Figueroa is believed to have 
facilitated the delivery of arms to the terrorist group. 
Figueroa called the investigation a "witch hunt" and accused 
the GOC of trying to distract attention from its "internal 
political crisis."  Ecuadorian Congresswoman Maria Augusta 
Calle allegedly loaned her Quito bank account to the FARC and 
may have received financial support from the terrorist group. 


POLO REACTION 

------------- 

¶6.  (C) In an official communique, the Polo party reiterated 
its support for the proper pursuit of justice while 
expressing confidence in the innocence of its three members 
(the two representatives and Lozano).  Cordoba and Borja
called the investigation a "smokescreen" while Ramirez 
accused the GOC of trying to jeopardize humanitarian exchange 
efforts.  Polo Senator Gustavo Petro, who opposes Borja and 
Ramirez in the Polo's internal elections, does not discount 
the possibility that the two maintained inappropriate ties 
with the FARC.  The FARC and the Communist Party maintained 
formal relations from 1974-1993.  If the two were implicated 
in ongoing relations with the FARC, Petro said, it would 
split the Polo apart.
