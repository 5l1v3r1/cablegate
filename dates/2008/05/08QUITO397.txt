COMMITTEE MEETING 
 
REF: STATE 43044 
 
¶1.  (SBU) PolOff delivered reftel points and U.S. proposed 
papers to the MFA's Multilateral Affairs Directorate on April 
23, 2008.  We received a response on April 30 from Lourdes 
Puma, MFA Director General of Multilateral Affairs, who had 
been previously unavailable due to travel and her 
participation in the EU-Andean Community negotiations. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Puma said that Ecuador was unable to attend the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Preparatory Committee 
(PrepCom) meeting due to limited resources.  She said that 
she had not yet reviewed the documentation, and wanted the 
opportunity to do so before making any comments, promising to 
contact us thereafter with any questions or comments.  Post 
will follow up at a later date to clarify the GOE's position.
