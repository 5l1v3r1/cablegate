SUBJECT: TUNISIAN MFA STATEMENT ON CONCERN OVER SITUATION 
IN LEBANON 
 
 
¶1. (U) On May 8, the Tunisian Foreign Ministry released a 
statement regarding its concern about the situation in 
Lebanon.  Text of the MFA communique (official Tunisia-Africa 
Press Agency translation) is as follows: 
 
BEGIN TEXT: 
 
Tunisia is following with deep concern the evolution of the 
security situation in Lebanon, after the serious events which 
took place in some Lebanese areas, since yesterday, and which 
risk to become uncontrollable. 
 
Tunisia calls upon all Lebanese protagonists to show 
restraint, prioritize Lebanon's higher interest, and preserve 
the country's national unity, security, and stability. 
 
It reiterates its call on all sides to avoid escalation and 
violence and prioritize dialogue and peaceful means to settle 
their differences. 
 
Tunisia voices hope that the brotherly Lebanese people will 
manage to overcome this difficult juncture, in such a way as 
to preserve Lebanon from all dangers and negative fallout. 
 
END TEXT. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment:  With this public statement, the Government 
of Tunisia is maintaining its traditional moderate stance 
vis-a-vis regional issues.  The MFA communique was covered in 
the Tunisian press, and echoed in editorials in some media 
outlets.  Its moderate message has not fully filtered down to 
the most popular Arabic daily ash-Shourouq, however, which is 
known for its anti-American slant.  The coverage of events in 
Lebanon in the May 8 and 9 editions of ash-Shourouq, for 
example, cast Nasrallah in the role of the hero and showcased 
his anti-American rhetoric.  End Comment.
