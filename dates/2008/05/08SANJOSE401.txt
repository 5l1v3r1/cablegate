¶1. (U) On May 14, two JTF-B Blackhawk helicopters completed a 
humanitarian assistance airlift of 180,000 pounds of 
suspension bridge material for Costa Rica's indigenous 
population in the remote and mountainous Talamanca area.  The 
mission began on May 7 and was to conclude in four days, but 
due to inclement weather was extended to May 14 in order to 
complete the airlift of all materials, which included cement, 
planks, fencing, rope and rebar reinforcement rods.  It took 
approximately 50 sorties to complete the mission. 
 
¶2. (U) The suspension bridging material, enough to build five 
bridges, will replace dangerous home-made bamboo bridges that 
currently span rushing streams and high gorges.  In the past 
year and a half, over 20 people have died and more than 30 
have been injured at the bridge sites, including children who 
died while trying to go to school.  We suspect that there 
have been many more deaths that have gone unreported.  The 
bridges in these remote areas are essential as most schools, 
hospitals, and other components of the government's social 
support networks are located several hours walking distance 
from the communities.  During the rainy reason, floods often 
isolate these communities and the new suspension bridges will 
assist the indigenous population to self-evacuate to safer 
areas. 
 
¶3. (U) In addition to the airlift of materials, JTF-B 
helicopters were able to support the indigenous communities 
of Talamanca with several other humanitarian missions.  For 
example, an eight-month old dehydrated baby and her mother 
were medevac'd as well as an 11-year old girl who had been 
severely bitten by a venomous snake.  All of the patients 
have recovered from their injuries.  Also, a five-person 
Costa Rican medical team was airlifted to a remote village 
called Piedra Meza (site of a December MEDRETE, see Ref B) to 
provide medical care to some ill indigenous families.  Over 
20 individuals received treatment. 
 
¶4. (U) The humanitarian airlift was a joint operation 
conducted with JTF-B helicopter and rigging assets, GOCR 
emergency management personnel, local NGOs, and about 50 
local laborers who assisted in the loading and unloading of 
the materials from the helicopters.  According to Veronica 
Vega of the GOCR's National Community Development 
Directorate, more than 15000 local indigenous persons will 
benefit from the construction, to be carried out by the GOCR 
and NGOs, of the suspension bridges. 
 
¶5. (U) Both local and national Costa Rican media carried wide 
coverage of the event, including television and print.  All 
of the coverage was positive and accurately described the 
involvement and coordination between USG, GOCR and local 
NGOs.  We did not see any negative references to the use of 
U.S. military assets in Costa Rica.

COMMENT 
======= 
 
¶6. (SBU) As noted in Ref A, this airlift came in the wake of 
a specific GOCR request for U.S. military assistance for 
humanitarian projects.  Along with last December's MEDRETE 
(Ref B), the successful completion of this complex mission -- 
involving an unprecedented partnership of U.S. military, 
non-law enforcement GOCR entities, local NGOs, and local 
laborers -- is a significant development for a country (and 
administration) traditionally reluctant to be involved with 
most things military. 
 
¶7. (SBU) By using soft military power, the airlift of these 
suspension bridge materials directly contributed to 
furthering two of our four Mission Strategic Plan goals for 
Costa Rica, investing in people and promoting prosperity. 
Post thanks OSD, SOUTHCOM, and JTF-B for approving this 
mission.  The impact has been huge, both on the Costa Rican 
people and on the positive image of the U.S. government and 
military.  We especially want to thank the highly competent 
and professional 16-member military team, who performed 
flawlessly.  The pilots, crew, and rigging teams were truly 
first-class.  Thanks to their hard work in unforgiving 
terrain and hot weather, U.S. objectives in Costa Rica and 
the region were directly and positively advanced. 
 
¶8. (U) We will conduct a follow-up visit to the bridging 
 
sites once the construction is complete.
