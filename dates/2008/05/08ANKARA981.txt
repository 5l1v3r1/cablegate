¶1.  On May 22, we delivered reftel demarche to Volkan 
Oskiper, Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, First Secretary 
for International Political Organizations.  Oskiper said the 
Government of Turkey (GOT) shares the U.S.Government's 
concerns about the Burma regime's rush to move to 
reconstruction efforts.  The GOT has given USD one million to 
the United Nations for relief efforts in Burma.  The money 
was split equally between UNICEF and the Office of 
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.  The GOT does not plan 
to make any additional pledge at the Burma Donors Conference 
on May 25. 
 
¶2.  Turkey's Ambassador to Thailand is also accredited to 
Burma.  The GOT asked him to travel to Burma for a May 22-23 
tour of the disaster area and asked him to remain in Rangoon 
through May 25 to monitor the pledge conference.  Oskiper 
emphasized that the GOT does not intend to make any pledge at 
the conference.
