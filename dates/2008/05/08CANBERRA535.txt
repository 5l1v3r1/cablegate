Dear Colleagues 
 
Today, May 21, marks Cuban Solidarity Day.  The date is 
linked to the anniversary of the death of Pedro Luis Boitel, 
a poet and activist, who died while on a hunger strike in a 
Cuban jail in 1972. 
 
The purpose of this event is to promote peaceful democratic 
change in Cuba, by demonstrating broad and robust support for 
the Cuban people, and to reflect on the plight of prisoners 
of conscience and the dearth of civil and political freedoms 
within that state.  Attached you'll find a 2007 human rights 
report from the U.S. Department of State, as well as a human 
rights report from Freedom House, also on the human rights 
situation in Cuba. 
 
I encourage you as members of this Parliamentary Friendship 
Group to mark today by demonstrating your support for 
ordinary Cubans, by visiting www.solidaridadcuba.org to find 
out more information about Cuban Solidarity Day or through 
signing a petition for the release of Cuba's political 
prisoners at www.peticioncuba.org. 
 
Kind regards 
 
Michael Danby MHR 
Chair, Australia-U.S. Parliamentary Friendship Group

(Note:  Mr. Danby had also volunteered to draft an op-ed for 
the Financial Review, but the newspaper had not published any 
Cuba-related item as of COB May 22.  End note.) 
 
¶3. (SBU) Outreach to the Cuban community:  CG Sydney hosted a 
coffee for prominent author and Cuban exile Luis Garcia on 
the morning of May 22.  Garcia, whose parents sought 
political asylum in Spain and then migrated to Australia in 
the 1960's,  was familiar with President Bush's gesture in 
proclaming May 21 a Day of Solidarity with the Cuban People, 
and commended the United States commitment to principles of 
democracy and freedom. 
 
¶4. (U)  U.S. Mission Webpages:  The webpages for the U.S. 
Embassy and Consulate Generals (CG) Melbourne, Perth and 
Sydney prominently featured a Solidarity Day article, along 
with background information and the President's May 21 
proclamation and his remarks to the media on the occasion. 
 
¶5. (U) Local media coverage:  Despite aggressive attempts by 
the Embassy and CGs to place the Solidarity Day op-ed in 
prominent papers in Australia, including the Sydney Morning 
Herald, The Australian, The Melbourne Age, and the Canberra 
Times, no papers have picked up the item to date.
