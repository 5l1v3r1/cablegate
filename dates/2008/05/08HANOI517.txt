SUBJECT: DAY OF SOLIDARITY WITH CUBAN PEOPLE - VIETNAM RESPONSE 
 
REF:  STATE 45792 
¶1. (SBU) Mission Vietnam has considered activities for May 21 - Day 
of Solidarity with the Cuban People.  We will continue to raise our 
concerns about Cuba discreetly to key players in the GVN.  In view 
of local considerations, however, we have not scheduled any public 
outreach activities. 
¶2. (SBU) These considerations include the fact that Vietnam is a 
traditional Communist ally of the Cuban government, and - at present 
- Vietnam's state-controlled press will not allow any piece directly 
or indirectly critical of the Cuban government.  In fact, activism 
on our part could spark a concerted propaganda counter attack, which 
could prove effective in negatively affecting views towards the 
United States.  Any activity highlighting the plight of political 
prisoners, in particular, would lead the regime to react, 
considering that Vietnam has political prisoners of its own. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The (relatively) good news is that, despite its long 
history of ties with Cuba, Vietnam does not have extensive relations 
and there is a very small number of Cubans living in Vietnam.  Over 
time, we expect that continued progress in our bilateral relations 
will erode the affinity still felt by some for the Cuban regime and 
people.  In future years, with continued progress, we will be better 
positioned to contribute to these global efforts.
