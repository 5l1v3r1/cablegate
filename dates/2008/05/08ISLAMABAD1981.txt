SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERY TO MOVE ENGINEERS FROM UNMIS TO 
UNAMID FOR 90 DAYS 
 
REF: SECSTATE 55232 
 
(U) On May 28, Poloff delivered reftel points to Farhat 
Ayesha, the Assistant Director of the United Nations I Desk 
at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, regarding the movement of 
engineers from the UN Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) to the 
UN-African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) for 90 days. 
Farhat noted to Poloff that Pakistan had already committed a 
number of helicopters, a military field hospital, and 
approximately 1000 peacekeeping and professional personnel to 
UNAMID.  However, she pledged that she would look into the 
matter to see if UNMIS could afford to lose these engineers 
for this period of 90 days.  Post will follow up and pass 
along a response accordingly.
