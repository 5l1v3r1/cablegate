SUBJECT: FRIENDS OF IRAQ CONFERENCE JUNE 17-19, 2008, UAE 
 
¶1. This is an action request. See para 3. 
 
¶2. SUMMARY. Multi-National Force-Iraq (MNF-I), Government of 
Iraq (GOI), and U.S. Embassy Baghdad will co-host the Friends 
of Iraq Conference (previously known as the Iraq Conference) 
at the Armed Forces Officer Club (AFOC), Abu Dhabi, United 
Arab Emirates, June 17-19, 2008. Posts are requested to 
solicit participation by military and/or civilian 
representatives from Coalition partners and prospective 
partners. This conference provides an opportunity to discuss 
how to collectively build on the gains achieved in Iraq and 
to discuss current and emerging needs and coalition 
opportunities. The conference also provides a forum to 
underscore that the U.S. drawdown of surge forces does not 
communicate a reduced need for Coalition support or a reduced 
USG commitment to Iraq. Key conference invited speakers 
include Multinational Force-Iraq Commanding General (CG 
MNF-I) General David Petraeus and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq 
Ryan Crocker. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3. ACTION REQUEST. Embassies are requested to convey the 
following invitation in para 4 and conference details in para 
5 as soon as possible. Hotel accommodations at the AFOC are 
reserved only for those annotated in para 6A, all others are 
requested to make reservations at the nearby Shangri-La Hotel 
(www.shangri-la.com). Participants from each country are 
expected to be well versed on Iraq issues. Some invited 
countries have no current involvement in the coalition, but 
CG MNF-I requests the conference be as inclusive as possible 
and approach all potential capability contributors. Please 
note that the name of the conference was changed from "Iraq 
Conference" to "Friends of Iraq Conference" after the 
invitation was delivered to many participants through 
military channels. Web sites and other material now reflect 
the new name. 
 
3A. For USUN: Extend an invitation to the UN Under Secretary 
for Political Affairs, Ambassador Lynn Pascoe.

Secretary General for Operations, Mr. Martin Howard.

MNF-I CONFERENCE INVITATION

¶4. INVITATION. The signed original of the following 
invitation has been delivered to USCENTCOM Senior National 
Representatives (SNR) in Tampa, FL dated April 24, 2008. 
Bahrain, Oman, Iceland, and Montenegro do not have SNRs; the

BEGIN TEXT OF INVITATION. 
 
The Government of Iraq; Chief of Mission, United States 
Embassy-Baghdad; and Commanding General Multi-National Force 
- Iraq, are pleased to invite you to their Iraq Conference in 
Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates from 17 to 19 June 2008. 
 
Over the course of the last six months, Iraqi and Coalition 
forces have realized marked improvements in security that 
present opportunities to accelerate and focus rebuilding 
efforts throughout Iraq. Iraq's leaders are capitalizing on 
this momentum by tackling national issues and promulgating 
legislation that is improving governmental processes and 
reinvigorating the economy. These efforts will also give 
other nations innumerable opportunities to sustain rebuilding 
efforts and continue to improve their long-term relationship 
with the Government and people of Iraq. 
 
At the Iraq Conference, we will discuss how we can 
collectively build upon these gains and organize to 
accomplish the work that remains. Please come prepared to 
address what your country can contribute to this important 
endeavor. 
 
Senior officials will attend from the United States 
Department of State, the Government of Iraq, and the United 
States Department of Defense. Therefore, we respectfully ask 
that at a minimum, the Vice or Deputy Chief of Defense, and a 
senior representative from the Foreign Ministry attend. 
 
Please find important conference details enclosed. We look 
forward to seeing and spending time with your nation's 
representatives, and we are prepared to assist you in any way 
possible to make this a memorable and successful conference. 
If you require an interpreter or any other special 
accommodations please let us know so that we can make 
necessary arrangements. 
 
Sincerely, 
Moffak al-Rubaie 
National Security Advisor 
Government of Iraq
