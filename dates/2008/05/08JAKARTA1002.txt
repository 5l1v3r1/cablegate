SUBJECT: INDONESIA - GLOBAL LAUNCH OF HARRISON FORD PSAS ON WILDLIFE 
TRAFFICKING 
 
REF: STATE 50722 
 
¶1.  This message responds to reftel action request on the global 
launch of three television public service announcements (PSAs) on 
combating wildlife trafficking featuring actor Harrison Ford. 
 
¶2.  Post has been in discussions with Cinema 21, the largest 
Indonesian cinema network.  Cinema 21 has indicated their 
willingness to show the PSAs -- pending their internal review of the 
PSAs -- before screenings of the new Indiana Jones movie, which 
opens in Indonesian theaters on May 22.  They would potentially air 
the PSAs before each screening of the movie country-wide.  If 
possible, Post requests permission to have Cinema 21 begin showing 
the PSAs before the June 5 launch date, in order to maximize the 
potential audience while the movie is running in Indonesia.  Post 
will also try to place the PSAs on television networks beginning 
June 5. 
 
¶3.  Regardless of whether Post can air the PSAs before June 5, Post 
requests that OES send broadcast-quality copies of the PSAs to 
Embassy Jakarta immediately, preferably in Betamax PAL format (in 
addition to DVD copies).  Post also welcomes the opportunity to 
download and record the PSAs from the American Embassy Television 
Network at the earliest possible time.  Please advise when AETN 
plans to transmit the PSAs. 
 
¶4.  Please direct copies of the PSAs, and any questions, to Machut 
Shishak, Environment Officer (Email: shishakma@state.gov, Phone: 
+62-21-3435-9229, +62-811-149-5710) and Stafford Ward, Assistant 
Information Officer (Email: wardsa@state.gov, Phone: 
+62-21-3435-9565, +62-811-198-0511).  The embassy mailing/courier 
delivery address is US Embassy Jakarta, Jl. Medan Merdeka Selatan 
No.4-5, Jakarta 10110, Indonesia.  Please use rapid delivery to 
ensure there is time to review the content.  Thank you.
