REF: STATE 51372 
 
¶1. (U) PolOff delivered the UN System of Internal 
Justice demarche to Deputy Director General Pekka 
Oinonen of the MFA's Legal Department and to Director 
Kai Sauer of the Unit for General Global Affairs on 
May 20. 
 
¶2. (U) Oinonen stated that the GoF agrees with most 
of the points in the US non-paper, and that the EU 
and the US are generally on the same track.  However, 
at the GA legal experts meetings in June and July, 
the GoF may raise concerns on legal security for 
employees; the number of judges in the UNDT; right of 
appeal based on material facts; and limitations 
placed on "conditions of employment" claims. 
 
¶3. (U) Regarding "Transitional Arrangements", they do 
not support the transfer of existing cases into the 
new system.  Existing cases should be resolved on the 
current system even if the tenure has to be extended, 
Oinonen said; the new system should accept only new 
cases.
