¶1. (SBU) We confirmed on May 7, per ref A inquiry, that 
Ukraine is seeking re-election to the UN Human Rights Council 
(UNHRC) with Iryna Kachenko, UN Desk Officer for elections in 
the MFA's International Organizations Division.  We also 
conveyed the USG position expressing deep concern about the 
performance of the UNHRC.  Ms. Kachenko advised Poloff that 
the GOU shares U.S. concerns that the UNHCR is being used for 
little more than making damaging public condemnations of 
Israel.  She expressed the GOU's willingness to continue to 
work with the U.S. to make the UNHRC a more legitimate and 
responsive body to address global human rights issues. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Embassy Comment: Ukraine has been a leader among 
post-Soviet republics in the field of human rights both at 
home and abroad and should continue its strong record if 
re-elected.  Ukraine's voting record in the UNHRC has been 
identical to France and differs from that of EU members, 
Great Britain, Germany, and Poland by virtue of one 
abstention rather than a no vote on the November 15, 2006 
resolution S-3/1 (Beit Hanoun assault).  Should it be 
re-elected, we anticipate that Ukraine would continue to 
follow the EU's lead and be a good ally in the Commission for 
the U.S. with regard to promoting human rights globally. 
Re-election to the UNHRC would affirm and recognize Ukraine's 
commitment to human rights, which would also serve to support 
USG objectives to solidify democracy in Ukraine.  End Comment.
