APPLICATION 05-050096158 
 
REF: SECSTATE 50430 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Post validates the bona fides of application 
05-050096158 and asses the information conveyed reftel as 
accurate.  On May 16, Econoff visited Technical Communication 
Solutions Maroc (TCSM) and met with its Director, Ahmed 
Eljorfi.  TCSM is a small consulting business, with an office 
in the industrial zone of Temara.  Eljorfi was able to speak 
about the sale, intended use, and export license application 
for 12 x Advanced Radar Surveillance Systems (ARSS-1), and 
produced operating and maintenance manuals for the equipment. 
 He produced his file of the transaction that included a 
signed purchase order between the Chief of the Procurement 
Division, National Defense Administration (MOD) and 
Telephonics Corp, signed January 9, 2008.  Eljorfi explained 
his (TCSM) role in the transaction as a consultant and 
facilitator, who was first approached by Colonel Major 
Boujemaa Bouraada, Inspector of Transmission (Signal Corps) 
in 2007. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Eljorfi is a retired Royal Moroccan Air Force 
(RMAF) avionics and radar officer/technician.  He attended 
technical training with the U.S. Air Force at Chanute AFB, IL 
in 1977, and at McClellan AFB, CA in 1983.  He retired from 
the RMAF in 1992 and worked for Harris Corp. until starting 
his own consulting firm in 1999.  His firm specializes in 
security and surveillance equipment.  He explained that the 
12 ARSS-1 radars are ground surveillance systems that will be 
used by Moroccan border security forces to detect illegal 
immigrants and unauthorized transit along Morocco's borders. 
He said TCSM would never take possession of the equipment, 
but that it would instead go directly to the Direction of 
Reception and Transit in Casablanca (a military storage and 
reception facility) before being deployed to the field. 
Eljorfi explained that his role was to act as Telephonics 
(Griffon Corporation's electronic and communication systems 
subsidiary) intermediary in Morocco, and to provide 
instruction to the Moroccan military on its operation and 
maintenance.  When asked how he became involved with 
Telephonics, Eljorfi said he was first approached by the 
Signal Corps in February 2007, who was interested in 
purchasing border surveillance radars.  Eljorfi explained he 
did a simple search on the Internet for distributors of 
suitable systems, which led to his association with 
Telephonics. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In a March 2008 meeting with U.S. Ambassador Riley, 
Lt Gen Abdelaziz Bennani, Inspector General of the Royal 
Moroccan Armed Forces, mentioned these radars and asked for 
USG assistance in facilitating their delivery.  Post has no 
doubt the Moroccan military ordered them from Telephonics or 
that TCSM is the bona fide local agent for Telephonics in 
Morocco.
