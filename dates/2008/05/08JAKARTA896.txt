REF: JAKARTA 795 
 
¶1.  (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- Please 
handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  The GOI has returned four fugitive 
Timor-Leste soldiers to GOTL authorities.  The four were 
wanted for suspected involvement in the February 11 attacks 
on President Ramos-Horta and PM Gusmao in Dili.  The arrest 
and return of the four fugitives at the GOTL's request is the 
latest indication of Indonesia's desire to maintain 
constructive relations with its neighbor.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  (U) FUGITIVES RETURNED:  Indonesian National Police 
sources have confirmed that four Timor-Leste nationals were 
handed over to GOTL authorities in Dili on May 5.  According 
to reports, Egidio Lay Carvalho, Jose Gomes, Ismail Moniz 
Soares and Pito Tilman were accompanied back to Dili by the 
head of Indonesia's Detachment 88 anti-terror unit (SD-88) 
Brig. Gen. Surya Dharma.  The four men were reportedly active 
duty members of the Timor-Leste military (FDTL), including 
two from the army, one from the navy, and one from the 
military police. 
 
¶4.  (U) ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT IN DILI TURBULENCE:  The four men 
are suspected of involvement in the February 11 attacks on 
President Jose Ramos-Horta and Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao. 
The attacks were led by renegade FDTL leader Alfredo Reinado, 
who was killed during the February fighting.  According to 
police sources, the men entered Indonesia from Timor-Leste 
without documentation soon after the attacks.  Indonesian 
police arrested three of the four men in West Timor, the 
Indonesian province adjacent to East Timor, in April 
following a request from the GOTL (reftel).  The fourth man 
was picked up in Jakarta. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) TRYING TO BE CONSTRUCTIVE:  The GOI's prompt 
accession to the GOTL's requests to capture and return the 
fugitives--despite the lack of a formal extradition 
treaty--is evidence of Jakarta's desire to maintain 
constructive relations with its neighbor.  Recent comments by 
President Ramos-Horta which basically alleged some sort of 
Indonesian hand in the February turbulence were not taken 
well in Jakarta, though a recent visit to Indonesia by PM 
Gusmao helped smooth relations out.  By taking the concrete 
action of rendering the men back to Dili, the GOI clearly 
hopes to get fully back in the good graces of Dili while 
helping the GOTL deal with restive elements.
