¶1. (SBU) Embassy Paris' Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear 
Terrorism (GI) POC was asked by the Russian Embassy to join 
in a demarche to the French MFA on the upcoming GI exercise 
activity in Kazakhstan in early June.  Embassy poloff 
accepted the meeting per guidance in reftel A.  French GI 
action officer Thomas Guibert welcomed the news of the 
Kazakhstan exercise and applauded Astana's initiative, 
particularly since the exercise appears to move into a new 
technical area of great interest to France: nuclear site 
protection.  Guibert noted that during the April 15 EPG in 
Paris, the GOF had also encouraged non-Western GI member 
states to take a more active role in this Initiative in order 
to highlight the importance of its international membership. 
Poloff emphasized that Western attendance at the Kazakh 
exercise was critical in order to encourage other non-Western 
states to also host GI events.  Guibert agreed to push 
strongly for French attendance. 
 
GIIP 
---- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Poloff also took the opportunity to reinforce the 
U.S. request for French participation at the June 2-4 Global 
Initiative Information Portal (GIIP) meeting in Tallinn, 
Estonia (refs B and C).  Guibert stressed France's strong 
interest in the GIIP, but noted that the GOF is having 
difficulties finding available officials for the meeting. 
 
FRANCE-HOSTED EXERCISES? 
------------------------ 
 
¶3. (SBU) Guibert told us that France continues to consider 
the possibility of hosting an exercise within the framework 
of the EPG but is waiting for the results of the two Madrid 
exercises before making a full commitment.  The GOF wants to 
have a better understanding of the scope of the exercises 
before beginning its own planning.  More practically 
speaking, France is the EU President from July 1-December 31, 
2008, and is already facing significant demands on its 
limited resources. 
 
NEW GI MEMBERS 
-------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Russian poloff announced the membership of three new 
countries in the GI: Ireland, Malta, and the UAE.  Guibert 
noted that the additions not only open up the GI to an 
important Middle East partner, but also mean that all EU 
countries are now members-- something France has long sought 
in order to seek EU funding for the GI.
