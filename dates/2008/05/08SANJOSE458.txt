¶1. (U) On May 22, we delivered the Department's talking 
points on WHA arguments against the Prisoners of Conscience 
Declaration (provided by Joseph Rees, Acting DAS, IO Bureau, 
via email) to the MFA's Chief of Staff Antonio Alarcon and to 
working-level MFA personnel. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On May 28, we followed up with the MFA's Deputy 
Director of Foreign Policy, Alejandro Solano, who told us 
that Costa Rica's main complaint was that the GOCR had not 
been consulted during the formulation process of the 
declaration. The MFA emphasized to us that writing such a 
declaration, with the knowledge of Costa Rica's interest and 
support of human rights without consultations during the 
drafting of the declaration, showed a lack of respect to the 
country. Therefore, he said, the GOCR would not sign on as a 
co-sponsor since the declaration was delivered to them with a 
"take it or leave it approach," with no opportunity to shape 
the declaration's content. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Solano added that Costa Rica, however, would vote in 
favor of the declaration in the UN. Nevertheless, upon 
receiving our points last week, he revisited the matter with 
FM Bruno Stagno, and the GOCR's decision not to cosponsor, 
due to being left out of the drafting process, was final.
