TAGS: ASEC OSCE AF
SUBJECT: OSCE: GUIDANCE ON PERMANENT COUNCIL DECISION ON 
OSCE-AFGHANISTAN CONFERENCE 
 
REF: USOSCE 128 
 
¶1. (SBU) The Department concurs with Post's analysis (reftel) 
of the potential political costs of opposing the PC draft 
decision (PC.DD/16/08) on the OSCE-Afghanistan conference, 
and therefore instructus Post not to block cosensus in 
support of the conference.  Given the potential uncertainties 
with regard to the security situation in Kabul for holding 
this conference, however, the Department believes the draft 
decision should include language that opens the way for the 
PC to revisit the decision should there be an unforeseen 
deterioriation in the security situation. 
 
¶2. (U) Post should seek to amend the DD by inserting at the 
end of the only sentence of operative paragraph 2, the 
phrase: "in order to facititate a Permanent Council review of 
this decision in the event of unforeseen security 
circumstances."
