SUBJECT: SOMALI PIRACY UN RESOLUTION RAISED WITH CZECHS 
 
REF: STATE 47531 
 
Embassy officials discussed demarche request related to the 
draft UN Security Council resolution on Somali Piracy with 
Czech UN Department official Rene Dlabal on May 7.  As the 
Czechs are rarely called upon to address issues linked to the 
UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, Dlabal welcomed our 
non-paper on the subject and indicated that he would be back 
in touch if anyone in his section had additional questions.
