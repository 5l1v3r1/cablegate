Main Stories:

For a third day, the dailies extensively report on Palestinian 
"disappointment" regarding remarks made by President Bush before the 
Israeli Knesset on May 15.  The dailies report President Abbas 
commenting, "We are not satisfied with Bush's speech and it made us 
angry."  Al-Hayat Al-Jadida opens with a red banner headline 
reading:  President Abbas says, "Neither Washington nor others can 
give the green light for surrendering Jerusalem."  Al-Ayyam's lead 
story quotes Abbas stating, "there are no understandings [with the 
Israelis], it is more of an exchange of opinions... distances 
[between positions] are still great." 
 
The dailies summarize the visit of President Bush by saying that he 
left the region in a state of more "frustration".  The papers also 
note that Bush's May 17 speech before the World Economic Forum in 
Sharm el Sheikh did not live up to Arab expectations and did not 
make mention that Palestinian statehood nor the conclusion of a 
final agreement would happen soon.  The dailies particularly focus 
on comments made by Egyptian President Mubarak that, "whoever thinks 
that Arabs will agree to any agreement that does not fulfill the 
hopes of the Palestinian people, is mistaken."  Mubarak added that 
Palestinian President, "Abbas needs a just and honorable solution," 
continuing, "not solving the Palestinians' issue will encourage 
terrorism." 
 
Front page related coverage of President Bush's regional visit, 
highlights Secretary Rice's expectations that peace negotiations 
will be "extensive."  Al-Quds carries an AFP report with Rice 
confirming that, "Israeli and Palestinian negotiators unofficially 
discussed a peace agreement." The dailies report that Israeli 
Foreign Minster Livni said, "it is best not to rush an agreement 
between the Palestinians and Israelis."  White House spokesperson 
Stephen Hadley is quoted in dailies admitting that, "Bush has 
nothing to announce regarding notable progress in the peace 
process." 
 
Dailies report on the meeting of President Bush and Palestinian 
Premier Fayyad in Egypt on May 18.  Al-Ayyam reports that Fayyad 
explained to Bush steps that he feels are necessary for the success 
of the political [negotiation] process. Fayyad listed the need to 
resolve the following issues in order of priority: Israeli 
settlement activity, Israeli security [military] action and the 
removal of checkpoints and freedom of movement.  Fayyad added that, 
"everything is meaningless if settlement activity continues." 
 
Palestinian Presidential spokesperson Abu Rudaynah denies rumors 
that Palestinian President Abbas intends to resign if peace efforts 
do not succeed, front pages announce.  Abu Rudaynah states that, 
"this news is baseless, and President Abbas is determined to 
continue working on achieving the Palestinian dream of an 
independent state." 
 
Negative coverage dominates front pages concerning Israeli 
intentions to conduct a military operation in the Gaza Strip. 
Al-Ayyam reports under a red banner that Israeli Premier Olmert will 
make a decision regarding a Gaza operation, "very soon."  Linked 
reports highlight that the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is deepening 
because of fuel shortages.  Other Gaza reporting focuses on a call 
by Hamas leader Ismael Haniyah on Egypt to re-open the Rafah border 
crossing in the event that Israel fails to approve a Gaza truce. 
Reporting is rounded out by all dailies with an AFP story about a 
 
JERUSALEM 00000845  002 OF 003 
 
 
call by Osama bin Laden to lift the "siege" on Gaza. 
 
Preparations for the Palestinian Authority's (PA) Palestine 
Investment Conference in Bethlehem wins positive coverage in all 
dailies.  The dailies note that more than 400 Arab businessmen 
received permits to participate in the conference.  Weekend coverage 
on the conference highlighted the role of PA security forces in 
ensuring the security of conference participants.  Al-Ayyam 
front-paged a weekend report featuring the White House press release 
of the names of the US Presidential Delegation members traveling to 
Bethlehem to participate in the investment conference.

Front pages dedicated extensive coverage to the meeting of President 
Bush with Palestinian President Abbas on May 17 in Egypt.  Al-Quds 
opened with, "Bush pledges to Abbas that he will work on achieving 
the dream of a Palestinian state."  According to Al-Ayyam, Abbas 
insisted that, "any agreement should include all [final status] 
issues." The dailies also ran comments by PLO negotiator Saeb Erekat 
revealing that,"President Abbas expressed to Bush his disappointment 
over Bush's remarks in front of the Knesset." Al-Quds reported that 
Bush replied by saying, "I am the first American president who 
talked about a Palestinians state, and I am absolutely determined to 
achieve this during my term." 
 
Ma'an news agency reported that the Israeli military removed a 
roadblock which previously closed off the southern entrance of the 
West Bank city of Hebron.  The removal had been postponed several 
times before because of protests by Israeli settlers claiming that 
removal threatens their security.  The road, which links the city of 
Hebron to a nearby industrial zone, has been closed since the 
beginning of the second Palestinian Intifada.

Pessimism accompanied coverage of the visit of President Bush to 
Israel and his remarks before the Israeli Knesset. Al-Hayat 
Al-Jadida opened with, "Palestinian disappointment following Bush's 
Remarks." The dailies reported that Palestinian negotiator Saeb 
Erekat told Reuters: "Bush should have told the Israelis that, 1 
mile from where he was speaking, there is a nation that has lived in 
disaster for 60 years. He should have told the Israelis no one could 
be free at the expense of others. He missed this opportunity and we 
are disappointed."  Al-Hayat Al-Jadida front-paged an AFP story 
entitled "the diplomacy of Bush left tremendous disappointment in 
the region." 
 
Efforts for a truce between Israel and Palestinians in Gaza received 
front-page coverage in the dailies.  All dailies reported that Hamas 
spokesperson Aiman Taha confirmed on May 16 that Hamas has delayed 
their visit to Cairo until next week.  On the other hand, the 
dailies reported that Tel Aviv has asked Cairo to resume mediation 
on the issue of the release of the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit.  In 
other Gaza news, coverage highlighted that unidentified gunmen blew 
off the door of the Rosary Sister's school in the center of Gaza 
city.

Â¶1.  Independent Al-Quds carried its daily editorial entitled 
"Important dots above many words!" (5/19): "...The American 
President repeated in his speech [May 18], in Sharm Al-Sheikh that a 
solution is possible before the end of the year. He called upon 
Israel to ease the suffering of Palestinians and to work against 
what he described as 'terrorism'. As if the only obstacles to 
reaching a peace agreement are Israeli military checkpoints.  Again, 
Bush ignored all [other] Israeli violations that destroy peace 
efforts.  Violations like settlements, the wall, isolating 
Jerusalem, the siege, and military campaigns as will as extreme 
Israeli positions in negotiations with Palestinians... In the end, 
all that Israel and the United states need to understand is that 
Arabs and Palestinians will not accept that the current situation 
continues. Israel is hiding behind peace slogans that have never 
been implemented. And the United States is taking a biased stand 
towards Israel without pressuring it to respond to the peace 
efforts. It is not logical to keep talking about peace while the 
vision of two states is at a stalemate with no real steps towards 
making peace."
