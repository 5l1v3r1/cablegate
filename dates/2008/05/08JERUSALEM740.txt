Main Stories:

Ongoing Egyptian efforts to reach an Israeli-Palestinian truce 
receive extensive coverage on the front pages of the dailies. 
Al-Quds leads with the announcement that, "Egypt will inform Israel 
about the details of the truce in the coming days."  According to 
the coverage, twelve Palestinian political and military factions 
have agreed in principle to accept a ceasefire with Israel.  The 
dailies report that Palestinian leaders agreed that any agreement 
should be bi-lateral, apply to both the Gaza Strip and the West 
Bank, and include an end to the siege of the Gaza Strip. On the 
ground, the dailies report that a Palestinian was killed and five 
where injured in an Israeli airstrike on Gaza on April 29. The 
dailies also report that sewage has begun to flood Gaza City streets 
and warned of a humanitarian and environmental crisis. 
 
The meeting of Saudi King Abdullah and Palestinian President Abbas 
on April 29 in Riyadh is front page news.  The dailies report that 
both leaders discussed the latest developments regarding the 
"Palestinian cause" and the peace process in the region. President 
Abbas also briefed the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques on the 
outcomes of his recent visits to the USA and Russia, according to 
the coverage. 
 
Comments made by Secretary Rice at the April 29 meeting of the 
American Jewish Committee in Washington received front page coverage 
in all dailies.  Citing an AFP story, the dailies highlight that 
Rice stated, "Hamas is fighting on behalf of Iran against Israel." 
She further explained that Palestinian Hamas militants are serving 
as "proxy warriors for an Iran bent on destroying Israel and 
destabilizing the Middle East[AFP]." 
Citing AFP, the front page of Al-Quds reports that French President 
Sarkozy confirmed on April 29, that he would support Palestinian 
President Abbas' efforts to develop the Palestinian Territories. 
President Sarkozy said that the security of Israel is linked to 
ending the Israeli occupation and establishing a viable, democratic 
and modern Palestinian state.  A related report on Al Ayyam's front 
page quotes the British Council in Jerusalem saying that progress 
should be made in the areas of negotiations, the economy and freedom 
of movement," in order to support peace efforts. 
 
The dailies report that the Israeli non-governmental organization 
B'Tselem has called upon the Israeli Army's Judge Advocate General 
to open a military police investigation into the circumstances of 
the death of a Palestinian mother and her four young children killed 
on April 29 by an Israeli shell in the northern Gaza area of Beit 
Hanun.  The dailies also report that the Israeli military stated 
that Israeli soldiers are not responsible for the killing. 
 
According to the dailies, the UN refugee organization OCHA issued a 
report stating that obstacles to movement in the West Bank increased 
to 612 following a detailed field survey completed on March 18. 
This represents an increase of 236 obstacles (62.8%) over the 
baseline figure of August 2005.

BLOCK QUOTES:

¶1.  Independent Al-Quds ran its daily editorial entitled "Which 
map?!" (5/01):  "Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni... presented 
the Palestinian negotiation team... an Israeli vision of a final 
 
JERUSALEM 00000740  002 OF 002 
 
 
agreement [as] a serious, official position presented through the 
main negotiation channel.  This bizarre solution indicates complete 
Israeli control over large settlements in the West Bank and in 
Jerusalem as well as in the Jordan valley.  This will go along with 
other security arrangements regarding [a mountain ridge between 
Jerusalem and Jericho].  The anger of Abu Ala' [Ahmad Quray, chief 
Palestinian negotiator] is not enough, even if it was necessary.  We 
think that it is the right of our people to ask the head of our 
negotiation team to say what is going on in these negotiations in 
order to enlist the support of Arab and international public opinion 
on the side of the Palestinians against Israeli polices that will 
never lead to a solution and erase the tension that exists in the 
region.  On the contrary, [the Livni plan] will make [the region] a 
center that is ready to explode into more violence and extremism. 
Israel, which is backed by Washington, should realize that peace has 
requirements and conditions that [must be followed and that not 
every agreement will] be accepted by any Palestinian Authority or 
any Palestinian official..." 
 
¶2.  Independent Al-Ayyam runs an op-ed by veteran columnist Abdullah 
Awwad, entitled "Which truce... which resistance and which 
negotiations?" (5/01):  "...whoever claims to represent the 
Palestinian people should not try to stop resistance... whether by 
an agreement or a truce or a unilateral truce and this is a rule for 
all Palestinian parties.  This right [to resist] belongs to the 
Palestinians people themselves. All agreements and truces do not 
prevent people who live under occupation from engaging in all means 
of resistance. Public ownership of resistance belongs to the people 
who are killed, burned, their children slaughtered, and their sons 
imprisoned daily.  When Hamas talks about resistance and a truce, it 
is playing a misleading game... A truce basically means ending 
resistance and Hamas has no right to do this nor does any other 
party.  Therefore, I am wondering what they are negotiating in 
Cairo?... this issue has only one explanation, each party has its 
own special calculation."
