SUBJECT: TRAVEL ALERT - SOUTH AFRICA 
 
¶1.  This Travel Alert advises American citizens of an 
increase in violent attacks on foreigners, particularly 
refugees or immigrants from other African nations. 
American citizens in South Africa are urged to monitor 
media reports and to avoid areas where attacks may be 
likely to occur.  This Travel Alert expires on July 1, 
¶2008. 
 
¶2.  In recent weeks, South Africa has seen an increase in 
the frequency, size, and duration of "xenophobic" attacks 
directed at foreigners - particularly refugees or 
immigrants from other African nations.  The most recent 
attacks started in the Johannesburg township of Alexandra 
but spread to other low income neighborhoods and informal 
settlements.  Several recent incidents of mob violence have 
taken place in other areas of Johannesburg including the 
Central Business District (CBD), Hillbrow, and Soweto.  An 
undetermined number of persons have been killed in these 
incidents and many more, including both targeted victims 
and bystanders, have been injured.  So far, most violent 
incidents have taken place at night. 
 
¶3.  While there have been no reports of Americans or other 
non-African visitors being targeted, these incidents of mob 
violence have developed quickly and proven difficult for 
local authorities to control.  American residents and 
visitors are advised to listen to local media for reports 
of such incidents and to avoid areas (including but not 
limited to townships) where they may be likely to occur. 
American citizens are reminded that while the most recent 
outbreak has been concentrated in the Johannesburg area, 
there have been attacks on foreigners in other areas and 
the potential exists for them to spread to other regions 
with little or no warning. 
 
¶4.  All Americans in South Africa are urged to register 
either online at https://travelregistration.state.gov or by 
phone or in person directly with the U.S. Embassy in 
Pretoria or the Consulates General in Johannesburg, Cape 
Town, or Durban.  Registering gives U.S. citizens access to 
updated information on travel and security within South 
Africa and makes it easier for the Embassy to contact them 
in case of emergency. 
 
¶5.  The U.S. Embassy is located at 877 Pretorius Street, 
Arcadia in Pretoria, telephone (27-12) 431-4000 (from South 
Africa 012-431-4000), fax (27-12) 431-5504 (from South 
Africa 012-431-5504).  The U.S. Embassy web site is 
http://usembassy.state.gov/pretoria/. 
 
¶6.  The U.S. Consulates General are at the following 
locations: 
 
The Consulate General in Johannesburg, which provides 
consular services for Americans in both Johannesburg and 
Pretoria, is located at No. 1 River Street (corner of River 
and Riviera Roads), Killarney, Johannesburg telephone (27-

(27-31) 305-7600 (from South Africa 031-305-7600), fax (27- 
31) 305-7691 (from South Africa 031-305-7691).  Its 
consular jurisdiction is the province of KwaZulu-Natal. 
 
¶7.  As the Department continues to develop information on 
any potential security threats to U.S. citizens overseas, 
it shares credible threat information through its consular 
information program documents, available on the Internet at 
http://travel.state.gov. In addition to information on the 
Internet, travelers may obtain up-to-date information on 
security conditions by calling 1-888-407-4747 toll-free in 
the U.S. and Canada, or outside the U.S. and Canada on a 
regular toll line at 1-202-501-4444.
