Â¶1. (U) On May 06, POLOFF delivered reftel demarche to Neusa 
Marques, Legal Advisor to the Director General of External 
Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Marques accepted 
the demarche, and stated that the GOCV appreciates the 
importance of maritime security issues.  However, they are 
unable to immediately respond, as the MFA is currently extremely 
busy drafting food aid requests to the international community. 
Post will forward any GOCV response to this issue upon receipt.
