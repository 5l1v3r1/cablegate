INTITIATIVE AND BIOTECHNOLOGY 
 
Ref: A) STATE 52628, B) STATE 53346 
 
¶1.  This report was coordinated with FAS Ankara. 
 
¶2.  We delivered reftel messages to Turkish Foreign Trade 
Undersecretariat Deputy Director General for Multilateral Affairs, 
Hasan Yalcin.  He told us that Turkey too is concerned about rising 
food prices.  It has long supported a reduction of agricultural 
subsidies during discussions at the WTO and asked us for information 
on any specific new proposals the U.S. plans to submit in support of 
the President's Global Food Security Initiative.  Yalcin expressed 
concern, however, that with global food prices already at a "crisis" 
level, an abrupt end to agricultural subsidies could further 
increase prices in the short term instead of leveling out the market 
and providing relief.  He said that any proposal would be carefully 
considered by Turkey. 
 
¶3.  We provided Yalcin the information in ref B about agricultural 
biotechnology and mentioned the EU's WTO requirements related to 
this subject.  Turkey is harmonizing its regulations with the EU and 
has often sided with the EU on this issue.  We will report septel 
about our efforts to increase public awareness about the benefits of 
agricultural biotechnology in Turkey.
