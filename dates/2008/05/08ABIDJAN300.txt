SUBJECT: WIPO DIRECTOR GENERAL ELECTION - COTE D'IVOIRE 
DEMARCHED 
 
REF: SECSTATE 47557 
 
¶1.  (U)  Emboff presented reftel demarche points and 
preferred candidate lists to MFA Assistant Director for the 
Office of Economic and Social Issues within the UN 
Department, Etienne Kinda.  Kinda asked if the French 
candidate were a preferred U.S. candidate.  Emboff reiterated 
that the five candidates on the list fit USG criteria for a 
strong leader, while several (not including the French 
nominee) would, in our view, obstruct progress on 
intellectual property issues.  Concerning the Ivoirian 
delegation to the WIPO conference May 13-14, Kinda said it 
was "likely" Minister of Advanced Technologies Ahmed Bakayoko 
would be the lead. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Comment.  Given strong French influence in Cote 
d'Ivoire (more than 1500 troops participate in peacekeeping 
here, Cote d'Ivoire's bilateral debt exceeds $1.5 billion, 
and French companies dominate finance and other key 
industries), it is possible that Cote d'Ivoire would support 
the French candidacy, at least in the first round, 
particularly given Kinda's reaction and question.  If that 
candidacy does not advance, however, Kinda's general 
receptivity to the demarche indicates Cote d'Ivoire could be 
receptive to supporting a candidate on the USG preferred 
list.  End Comment.
