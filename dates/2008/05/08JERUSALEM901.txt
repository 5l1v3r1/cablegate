Reaching Out to Democracy 
and Human Rights Activists 
-------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Since April 2007, ConGen officers have met with a 
broad range of human rights and civil society activists and 
democratic political leaders from the West Bank and Gaza. 
During these meetings, ConGen officers expressed strong USG 
support for activists' efforts to build a more democratic and 
secure future for Palestinians.  Examples of these efforts 
include regular meetings in Jerusalem and the West Bank with 
the Palestinian Independent Commission for Citizens' Rights, 
International Committee of the Red Cross, Arab Studies 
Society, Jerusalem Center for Women, and a variety of other 
local and international groups. 
 
MEPI Programmatic Support 
------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Post has developed and administers wide-ranging 
Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) and Public 
Diplomacy programs  to support the goals of achieving greater 
personal freedoms and improved democratic systems.  Post has 
a full-time MEPI coordinator who meets regularly with civil 
society activists and local and international NGOs to monitor 
existing programs and develop new programs.  Through MEPI 
programming, Post supports a portfolio of more than $15 
million in assistance to strengthen political parties, 
empower women, and develop an active civil society that 
advocates for good governance and critical personal freedoms. 
 Current MEPI programming includes $150,000 in small grants 
for six civil society organizations that educate Palestinian 
residents of East Jerusalem on their rights, confront honor 
crimes in Gaza, and empower youth throughout the West Bank. 
Post just completed this year's small grant competition and 
will fund 11 new projects focused on civic engagement of 
youth in under-served communities for a total of $300,000. 
 
PD Programmatic Support 
--------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Post's MEPI programs complement a robust Public 
Diplomacy outreach and program campaign to support democracy 
and human rights activists.  These efforts include visiting 
speaker programs, digital video conferences (DVC) with 
American speakers, including an April 3 DVC between 
Palestinian imams and American Muslim leader Ihsan al-Khatib 
on religious freedom.  PD also organized a March 18 DVC for 
Palestinians with American civil rights leader Dr. Bert 
Ransom on nonviolence.  In December 2007, PD gave a small 
grant to the Teacher Creativity Center, which strives to 
eliminate violence from schools by encouraging the 
integration of human rights education into Palestinian school 
curriculum. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) PD programming also included exchange programs that 
build skills, networks, and exposure of civil society and 
democracy leaders.  Post sent Rafeef Mujahad, attorney at 
al-Haq Human Rights Center in Ramallah, to the U.S. on a 
"Human Rights Advocacy and Awareness" International Visitor 
Leadership Program (IVLP) in November 2007.  In October 2007, 
human rights lawyer Ala'a Ghanayim participated in a 
"Judicial System" IVLP.  Upon their return, ConGen officers 
met with Ghanayim and Mujahad to discuss how they are using 
their new skills to promote human rights in the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip. 
 
Media Outreach 
-------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) On May 2, PAO sent a letter to 250 Palestinian 
journalists commemorating World Press Freedom Day and 
 
JERUSALEM 00000901  002 OF 002 
 
 
reiterating U.S. support for the freedoms of press and 
speech.  On May 3, PAO also contributed an op-ed to al-Quds 
newspaper, the largest Palestinian daily, which highlighted 
the importance of press freedom as a "necessary element in 
any free society" and applauded Palestinian journalists for 
their "commitment to providing the Palestinian people with 
the information they need to support a democratic society." 
 
Upcoming Plans 
-------------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Post will continue to meet with democracy and human 
rights activists and organizations to reinforce U.S. support 
for democratic institutions in a future Palestinian state and 
will report on these meetings.  Post will also continue to 
administer and support MEPI and Public Diplomacy programming 
that advances freedom and democracy in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip.
