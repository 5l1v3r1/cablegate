¶1. (U) Embassy Manama maintains regular contact with democracy and human rights activists and NGOs in Bahrain, and encourages leaders in government and in opposition to persist in the revival of parliamentary politics and other reforms that King Hamad launched in 2002. To the best of our knowledge, there are no active third country dissidents exiled to or receiving asylum in Bahrain.

¶2. (SBU) Since our last report on democratization outreach (ref B), Emboffs maintained frequent contact with individual oppositionists and activists. Group meetings included a February, 2008 roundtable discussion for civil society activists, hosted by Ambassador; DCM hosted a roundtable meeting with leaders of opposition parties. Embassy highlighted publicly the liberalizing reforms associated with the FTA; for example, on April 8, Bahrain TV aired an interview with Ambassador on the topic. Embassy Manama regularly meets with members of parliament and activists from all legal parties, except for several Sunni Islamist politicians who decline meetings with USG officials as a matter of policy. XXXXXXXXXXXX Since last year's response, Bahrain has experienced recurrent small street clashes between Shi'a youth and security forces. Some of those arrested and charged in connection with riots in December 2007 have alleged mistreatment at the hands of the police.
