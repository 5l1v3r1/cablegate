REF: A) USDOC 02728 B) D395137 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO), attempted 
to conduct a pre-license check at Golden Mutual (H.K.) Limited, 
Suite B, 11/F, Sun Hing Commercial Building, 55 Tong Mei Road, 
Kowloon, Hong Kong (Golden Mutual). The purpose of the visit was to 
determine the suitability of Golden Mutual to be the ultimate 
consignee (but not end user) of various cross tangential flow 
filtration components that are the subject of export license 
application D395137.  The items (ECCN 2B352) are valued at USD 
$6,100 and are controlled for chemical and biological weapons 
reasons (CB). The license applicant is Pall Corporation of East 
Hills, New York. 
 
¶3. According to the Hong Kong Companies Registry, Golden Mutual was 
registered in 1998. Its share capital is the Hong Kong equivalent of 
USD 1250.  Mainland national Liu, Xian is listed as the sole 
director.  His mainland identification number is 440111540707426. 
 
¶4.  A web search revealed that Golden Mutual does not appear to have 
a web presence.  However, Golden Mutual's address and phone numbers 
are also listed as the business address and phone numbers for a 
number of additional companies including HuaXing (HK) Industrial 
Development Co., Ltd (a mainland handbag manufacturer) as well as 
Shanyuantang Medicament Biological Holdings Limited (a mainland 
pharmaceutical company - www.syt.com.cn).  ECO surmises that the 
Golden Mutual address is located at the offices of a company 
secretarial firm. 
 
¶5.  Commercial assistant Carrie Chan attempted, on several 
occasions, to reach a representative of Golden Mutual at the contact 
number listed in reftel A.  The phone number was found to be the 
phone number for accounting firm David Ho & Co. The person answering 
the phone provided another number for Golden Mutual, namely (852) 
2388-9987.  A call to that number was rerouted to a mainland China 
number.  The person answering the phone at that number confirmed 
that Golden Mutual is located at this office (along with a number of 
other companies).  The person answering the phone (who did not 
identify herself) stated that she would pass along ECO's interest in 
meeting Hong Kong company Golden Mutual to the general manager. 
Subsequent follow-up calls to the company's Hong Kong phone number 
were not returned.  Finally, on May 23rd, Commercial Assistant Chan 
was able to reach someone at the 2388-9987 number.  The person 
answering the phone stated that Golden Mutual had left in December 
2007 and did not have further contact details. 
 
¶6.  According to its staff, the Hong Kong affiliate of the exporter 
(Pall Asia International Ltd.), is only involved in payment and 
logistics matters so is unaware of the order in question and is not 
familiar with Golden Dragon. 
 
¶7. Golden Mutual does not appear to be a suitable recipient of the 
subject controlled items since it has not been possible to verify 
the company's existence/operations in Hong Kong.
