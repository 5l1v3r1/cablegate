SUBJECT: AFTER-ACTION: "DAY OF SOLIDARITY WITH CUBAN 
PEOPLE" ACTIVITIES IN SURINAME 
 
REF: STATE 51536 
 
¶1. (U) In solidarity with the people of Cuba, Post placed 
an explanatory text with a link to solidaridadcuba.org on its 
website. 
 
¶2. (U) Given longstanding bilateral ties between Suriname 
and Cuba, Post faces an uphill battle in sensitizing the 
Government of Suriname to the plight of ordinary Cubans. 
Nevertheless, the Ambassador, who served in Havana in the 
1990's, has made it her personal mission to subtly educate 
Surinamers on the realities of life there. 
 
¶3. (U) To commemorate May 21 in particular, Post's planned 
signature event would have been a screening of the movie, 
"Bananas." Unfortunately, and despite Post's best efforts, 
these plans fell through; the express ordered copy of the 
film still has not arrived. The movie is not legally 
available in Suriname. As a substitute, and keeping the 
solidarity theme in mind, Post screened the inspiring movie, 
"In America" instead of "Bananas." Post will consider 
rescheduling a screening of "Bananas" at a later, similarly 
appropriate date. 
 
¶4. (U) There was no initial media coverage in Suriname.
