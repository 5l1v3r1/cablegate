Reaffirming its strongest condemnation of the 14 February 
2005 terrorist bombing, as well as of all other attacks in 
Lebanon since October 2004, and reaffirming also that those 
involved in these attacks must be held accountable for their 
crimes, 
 
Having examined the report of the International Independent 
Investigation Commission (S/2008/210) ("The Commission"), 
submitted pursuant to resolutions 1595 (2005), 1636 (2005), 
1644 (2005), 1686 (2006), and 1748 (2007), 
 
Commending the Commission for its outstanding professional 
work and the progress it continues to achieve under difficult 
circumstances in assisting the Lebanese authorities in their 
investigation into all aspects of this terrorist act, 
 
Taking note of the request to extend the mandate of the 
Commission expressed by the Commissioner in his briefing to 
the Security Council on 8 April 2008, in order to ensure 
stability and continuity in the investigative process, 
 
Taking note of the letter of the Prime Minister of Lebanon of 
8 May 2008 (S/2008/334, Enclosure) to the Secretary-General 
expressing the hope that the Security Council will respond 
favourably to the Commissioner's request by extending the 
mandate of the Commission until 31 December 2008, and noting 
the concurrent recommendation of the Secretary-General in 
this regard, 
 
Willing to continue to assist Lebanon in the search for the 
truth and in holding all those involved in this terrorist 
attack accountable, 
 
¶1.  Welcomes the report of the Commission; 
 
¶2.  Decides to extend the mandate of the Commission until 31 
December 2008 and declares its readiness to terminate the 
mandate earlier if the Commission reports that it has 
completed the implementation of its mandate; 
 
¶3.  Requests the Commission to report to the Council on the 
progress of the investigation at the latest in six months and 
at any other earlier time if it deems appropriate;
