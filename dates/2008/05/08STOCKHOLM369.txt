SUBJECT: USAID REPRESENTATIVE IN MAZAR-I-SHARIF URGES 
SWEDES TO INTEGRATE CIVILIAN ADVISORS AND MILITARY MORE 
EFFECTIVELY 
 
¶1. (SBU) On May 15-16, Deputy Economic Counselor accompanied 
USAID Field Program Officer (FPO) from Mazar-i-Sharif to 
meetings at the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, 
Ministry of Defense, Swedish Military Intelligence and 
Security Directorate, and the Swedish International 
Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA).  FPO shared the 
following observations at the close of a two-year tour in 
Mazar-i-Sharif: 
 
- The Swedish government should focus on integrating its 
civilian advisors with its military more effectively. 
 
- The German-led Regional Command North headquarters in Mazar 
would benefit from a greater civilian presence (only two 
civilians at present). 
 
- Swedish pre-deployment military training should include the 
civilian advisors with whom the Swedish military will work. 
 
- Swedish troop deployments to Mazar should be longer than 
six months to improve results.  (Sweden currently has 350 
troops covering four provinces in northern Afghanistan.) 
Swedish civilians stay in the PRT for a full year. 
 
- The Swedish military could win more "hearts and minds" in 
the local population by having some type of Civilian Military 
Cooperation (CIMIC) funds at its disposal for small projects 
with an immediate and visible impact that do not interfere 
with long-term development. 
 
- The Swedish PRT should begin to utilize Afghan expertise 
where possible. 
 
2.(SBU) FPO also identified the following sectors where SIDA 
should focus Swedish aid efforts: 
 
- Infrastructure 
 
- Rule of Law 
 
- Access to water and water usage 
 
- Groundwater hydro-geological assessments. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Swedes said they appreciated these comments, but 
did not provide any substantive replies to these 
observations.  Post will follow up to report Swedish 
responses septel.
