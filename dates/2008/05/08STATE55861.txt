SUBJECT: LIFTING OF TRAVEL WARNING: INDONESIA 
 
¶1.  Effective May 23, 2008, the Department has 
cancelled the Travel Warning issued for Indonesia. 
The Department has determined that the current 
security climate in Indonesia no longer warrants a 
Travel Warning. 
 
¶2. Updated information on safety and security in 
Indonesia can be found via the Bureau of Consular 
Affairs' Country Specific Information on Indonesia, 
updated May XX, 2008.  Americans can obtain 
information on travel and security in Indonesia from 
the Department of State by calling 1-888-407-4747 
within the United States and Canada; or 1-202-501-4444 
from outside the United States and Canada.  Americans 
can also call the Embassy in Jakarta at (62)(21) 3435- 
9000, the Consulate General in Surabaya at (62)(31) 
295-6400, and the Consular Agent in Bali at (62)(361) 
233-605.  American citizens should read the Department 
of State's Country Specific Information for Indonesia, 
the latest Worldwide Caution, and Fact Sheet on Avian 
Influenza, all available at http://travel.state.gov. 
 
 
¶3.  Americans living and traveling in Indonesia are 
urged to register and update their contact information 
with U.S. Embassy Jakarta, U.S. Consulate General 
Surabaya, or the U.S. Consular Agent in Bali. 
Registration facilitates the U.S. Mission's contact 
with Americans in emergency situations and may be done 
online and in advance of travel.  Information on 
registering can be found at the Department of State's 
Consular Affairs website, 
https://travelregistration.state.gov.  Registration 
information and recent warden messages are also 
available on U.S. Embassy Jakarta's website at 
jakarta.usembassy.gov.
