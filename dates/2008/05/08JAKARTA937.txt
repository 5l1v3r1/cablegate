RESPONSE 
 
REF: STATE 47531 
 
¶1.  (U) On May 12, Poloff discussed draft UNSC resolution 
(reftel) with Fikri Cassidy, Deputy Director for 
International Security and Disarmament at the Department of 
Foreign Affairs (DEPLU).  Urging Indonesia's support for the 
proposed resolution, Poloff emphasized that the measure was 
designed to assist the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) 
of Somalia and was being proposed with the TFG's support. 
 
¶2.  (U) Cassidy said DEPLU had already received a more 
advanced draft of the resolution and had already issued 
instructions regarding that draft to the Indonesian mission 
in New York.  In those instructions, Cassidy said, DEPLU had, 
in particular, raised concerns related to the United Nations 
Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).  Cassidy did not 
provide further detail regarding those instructions.
