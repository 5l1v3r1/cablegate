¶1. SUMMARY: Ethiopia-based Regional Refugee Coordinator (REFCOORD) 
and Washington-based Refugee Officer Matthew Austin recently visited 
Djibouti on separate occasions to survey the refugee situation and 
assess the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) 
activities.  During these visits, the National Office of Assistance 
to Refugees and Disaster Stricken People (ONARS) reported that the 
Government of Djibouti (GODJ) continues to search for solutions to 
cope with the current refugee and migrant influx.  Since the 
beginning of 2008, the refugee population at Ali Addeh camp has 
increased by 2,000 persons, or 20 percent.  ONARS struggles to 
accommodate the refugee influx and faults UNHCR Geneva for their 
lack of financial and resource assistance to Djibouti.  Meanwhile, 
UNHCR seeks NGO support for extending activities to refugees at the 
camp.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------ 
GODJ BLAMES UNHCR GENEVA 
------------------------ 
 
¶2. In 2006, UNHCR Geneva launched a special appeal to address the 
movement of Somali refugees and internally displaced people in the 
Horn of Africa.  The only condition to receive money from this fund 
was that there had to be an influx of Somali refugees in the country 
during 2006-2007.  Mr. Hassan Omar, the Secretary General of 
Djibouti's Ministry of Interior and the Executive of ONARS, traveled 
to Geneva in October 2007 to lobby for money from this fund and 
reportedly received a commitment from Geneva for USD 775,750 for 
July 2007 - to December 2008; however, Geneva has yet to give the 
funds to Djibouti.  Mr. Omar reported that UNHCR Geneva provided an 
official statement to the Ambassador of Djibouti in Geneva 
documenting the commitment.  Nevertheless, the GoDJ finds itself in 
a deadlock without the anticipated aid.

REFUGEE CAMP ISSUES 
------------------- 
 
¶3. The REFCOORD visited post from March 10-12 and the Bureau of 
Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM) conducted an additional 
visit from March 29-April 1.  Both visitors, accompanied by the post 
refugee officer and representatives from UNHCR and ONARS, witnessed 
refugees crossing the border between Djibouti and Somaliland 
(northwestern Somalia) at Loyada, visited Djibouti's sole refugee 
camp at Ali Addeh, and discussed the food pipeline with the World 
Food Program (WFP). 
 
¶4. During both visits to the refugee camp in Ali Addeh, the 
delegation found the refugees who were at the border the previous 
day collecting 15 days of food rations.  The food distribution was 
not a complete ration.  It lacked essential items due to 
communication failures by UNHCR and ONARS with the WFP.  Despite the 
problems encountered, food distribution has improved considerably 
since the last delegation visit in 2007.  For example, in an effort 
to improve the distribution process, ONARS replaced the camp 
manager.  Nevertheless, room for improvement remains, including the 
need for a well managed and constructed food distribution center and 
inventory controls.  UNHCR plans to send the new camp manager to 
Kenya's Dadaab refugee camp for training with WFP, UNHCR, and CARE, 
who manage food distribution for a camp population of approximately 
190,000.  PRM stressed the importance of sending the camp manager 
for training immediately. 
 
¶5. Refugees complained about the lack of an adequate supply of water 
and organized activities.  The bore holes and traditional wells are 
insufficient in number, and do not contain enough water to maintain 
Sphere standards of 15 liters per person per day for the refugee 
population.  In addition, the water in these wells is not drinkable 
because of the salt content.  A low water supply forces UNCHR to 
stagger the water availability to the refugees.  Refugees line their 
jerry cans up at the distribution point waiting for the allotted 
time to collect water.  UNHCR plans to conduct a hydrological survey 
in the Ali Addeh area, and subsequently develop the water system, if 
funds are available.  A large number of the population, especially 
the youth, is idle.  UNHCR would like to address this issue by 
implementing vocational training, income generating, and 
entertaining activities to alleviate the mounting pressures caused 
by a lack of activities.  In addition, the refugee camp lacks a 
community center, which would be an effective venue for such 
programs and various sensitization campaigns.

REFUGEE CAMP LACKS NGO SUPPORT 
------------------------------ 
 
¶7. The refugee camp lacks participation by international NGOs. 
Currently only one international NGO, the Association of Medical 
Doctors of Asia (ADMA), and one local NGO, the Association for the 
Protection and Advancement of the Family (APEF), work in the refugee 
camp.  AMDA runs a 24-hour medical clinic at the refugee camp, with 
one doctor, one midwife, two national nurses and two refugee nurses, 
working on consultations, treatment, MCH, HIV/AIDS, hygiene, family 
planning, and nutrition awareness programs.  It also operates a 
pharmacy, supplied with medicines from a stock in its Ali Sabieh 
office.  There is, however, no proper internal control on the 
procurement and distribution of these medical supplies, and a strong 
stock control mechanism needs to be developed. 
 
¶8. The clinic is very Spartan, lacking electricity and running 
water.  Each examination room is divided by wooden partitions or 
corrugated metal.  UNHCR expanded a health clinic donated by USAID 
in Ali Addeh village, to provide comfortable health services for the 
refugees.  As construction ended for the new site in February 2008, 
UNHCR discovered that the contractor had failed to install the 
electrical system.  UNHCR has not provided final payment to the 
contractor and is in discussion on resolving the matter.  UNCHR 
plans to reopen the clinic in May and expects that AMDA will 
relocate to the new facilities. 
 
¶9. The other NGO located at the camp, APEF, collects complaints and 
identifies issues from refugees, compiles data on them, and passes 
them on to UNHCR for resolution.  This NGO, like AMDA, has a daily 
presence in the camp.  It is one of the only sources where refugees 
can voice their concerns and complaints, since UNHCR's protection 
staff presence is limited.  A strong international NGO is needed in 
Djibouti to meet the needs of the growing refugee population and to 
relieve the burden from the overwhelmed UNHCR staff.  Matthew Austin 
is encouraging NGOs operating in the region to consider establishing 
operations in Djibouti. 
 
¶10.  The camp also has a small primary school (grades 3-8) run by 
UNHCR, in partnership with UNESCO-PEERS.  Each class has 
approximately 40 students.  All children wishing to enroll were able 
to do so at the beginning of the current school year.  However, the 
influx of new refugees has exceeded to capacity of the school to 
accommodate all new students.  UNHCR plans to build new classrooms, 
but could not say when they would be completed. 
 
¶11. After the completion of primary school, the children do not 
continue with their education because there is no secondary school 
located in the refugee camp, even though one is needed.  UNESCO's 
PEERS office in Djibouti provides technical assistance and teaching 
material.  Teachers explained they need more training, more material 
to teach with, and more school supplies. 
 
¶12. COMMENT: A year after the 2007 PRM delegation's visit, Post 
notes positive changes in refugee management with all parties 
involved.  Nevertheless, Post concurs with REFCOORD and Refoff's 
remarks that with the ongoing influx of southern Somali refugees, 
more needs to be done by UNHCR and its implementing partners on camp 
and food distribution management, together with refugee reception, 
protection, and assistance.  Additional improvements should include 
providing adequate water supply, possibly building a community 
center and creating activities, as well as reinforcing health, 
educational and nutritional capacities to meet refugee needs at the 
camp.  To meet these goals, UNHCR needs additional funds and 
training for its existing implementing partners, and the assistance 
of at least one internationally recognized large NGO with experience 
and resources.  END COMMENT.
