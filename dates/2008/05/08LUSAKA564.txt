¶1. Information Minister Mike Mulongoti confirmed to local press that 
the GRZ was making preparations to receive 25,000 Zimbabweans 
fleeing the violence in South Africa.  Mulongoti was responding to 
reports published by Agence France Presse (AFP) on May 26 which 
indicated the Red Cross Society was preparing to receive roughly 
5,000 families in Zambia.  According to press reports, these 
families are currently headed to Zambia via Botswana. 
 
¶2. UNHCR Country Representative James Lynch and ConOff discussed the 
AFP reports on May 27.  At that time, UNHCR expressed doubt as to 
the accuracy of this story and the imminence of such a large number 
of refugees. Subsequently, the International Federation of the Red 
Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) in Zambia issued a Note 
Verbale indicating that AFP misunderstood the comments made by their 
Southern Africa Zone head.  According to the IFRC, "no record about 
people fleeing from Southern Africa to seek refuge in Zambia in 
great numbers has reached our office." 
 
¶3. COMMENT: Post believes that Mulongoti may have been referring to 
GRZ, UNHCR, and IFRC contingency planning activities (Reftel) and 
his comments were designed to reassure the public that Zambia was 
ready for Zimbabwean refugees should they decide to come.  Post will 
remain in contact with UNHCR and will update as additional 
information becomes available.  END COMMENT
