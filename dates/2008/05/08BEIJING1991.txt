through diplomatic channels. 
 
Ban Ki-moon Possible Visit to China

¶3. In response to a question about UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon 
possibly visiting China after his visit to Burma, Qin said that he 
was not in a position to release information but that 
"consultations" were ongoing.  Qin said that China was very grateful 
for the expressions of condolences by the UN Security Council and 
Ban.  Qin said that these comments show that the international 
community stands with the Chinese government and people. 
 
No Information on Dirty Bomb Threat

Olympics.

------------------------------ 
 
¶5. Responding to a question about China's reported arms shipment to 
Zimbabwe, Qin said that the military goods "will return to China" 
and that the An Yue Jiang is currently on its way back to China. 
Qin called reports to the contrary "groundless and complete 
fabrications."  Pressed on whether China had spoken to the 
Zimbabwean government about the issue, Qin would only say that 
"because the reports are groundless, there is nothing to discuss." 
 
Oil Platform in South China Sea 
------------------------------- 
 
¶6. Asked about reports that a Chinese oil platform had been towed 
into the South China Sea escorted by Chinese naval vessels, Qin said

its islands.  China would like to solve disputes over the sea 
peacefully. 
 
Ian Nuclear Proposals
