SUBJECT: FRENCH ACCEPT USG DECISION ON UNAMID VEHICLES FOR 
BURKINA FASO 
 
REF: STATE 49780 
 
(SBU)  MFA DAS-equivalent Christine Fages discussed reftel 
demarche on May 15, saying that the GOF understood and 
accepted the USG decision not to help finance French-sourced 
VABs for use by Burkina Faso as part of its contribution to 
UNAMID.  She said that the euro-based price of the VABs 
increased their cost to the U.S. as the euro continued its 
rise against the dollar, despite French efforts to reduce the 
price.  She remarked that it seemed inevitable that the 
drawn-out effort to come to an arrangement over them would 
end in another solution.  Fages noted, however, that the 
Casspir vehicles selected by the USG were not as good as the 
French vehicles.  The GOF would face some difficulties in 
undoing what had already been done with the VABs but she said 
this would eventually be worked out.  She referred to some 
"housekeeping" that would have to take place in New York with 
the UN in terms of France's offer to assist Burkina Faso. 
Fages suggested that the French Presidency might be slightly 
irked by the USG decision, as the Presidency had been highly 
interested in helping assist Burkina Faso's participation in 
UNAMID, but she said "don't worry, we're not about to make a 
fuss with the U.S. over this kind of issue.  You made your 
decision, we understand the reasons for it, and we'll all 
move on."
