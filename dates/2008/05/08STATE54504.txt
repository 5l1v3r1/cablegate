¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  This cable contains OES' responses to 
Southern Cone Ambassadors' requests in reftel for more 
information on OPIC's energy investment fund and the 
Latin America Energy Initiative; for more public 
diplomacy materials on biofuels, specifically on the time 
frame for second generation biofuels; and for a new IV 
program on regional environmental law enforcement.  The 
Bureau of Oceans, Environment and Science (OES) thanks the 
Southern Cone Ambassadors for their interest and attention 
to our issues.  The Ambassadors identified a number of 
vitally important issues at the Southern Cone Chiefs of 
Mission conference, and we will incorporate their ideas 
into our strategic thinking and work with the interagency 
to develop approaches to these important regional and 
global issues.  In the meantime, we are able to provide 
some preliminary information and resources in the 
paragraphs that follow.  End summary 
 
------------------------------- 
OPIC ENERGY INVESTMENT FUND AND 
LATIN AMERICA ENERGY INITIATIVE 
------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) OES concurs that the new OPIC Energy funding 
is an exciting new opportunity to promote our interests 
globally and in the Latin America region.  We are eager 
to see the initiative move forward.  Unfortunately, at 
this time OES does not have additional information to 
provide as OPIC is still working out the details.  We 
understand that OPIC is planning a meeting in June with 
Private Sector partners to discuss this subject and we 
will report on further developments with regards to the 
funds when more information becomes available.  Should 
Ambassadors wish to follow up directly with OPIC, our 
POC is Executive Vice President John Simon at 
email: John.Simon@opic.gov and phone: 202-336-8407. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
PUBLIC DIPLOMACY MATERIALS ON BIOFUELS 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (U) OES agrees that more public diplomacy materials 
on the key topic of biofuels would be helpful in the 
near term, and we understand from IIP that more such 
materials are in the works.  We have consulted with IIP 
and identified a current article containing relevant 
information which can be found on the America.gov 
website at: http:// www.america.gov/st/ env-english/ 
2008/February/ 20080225140244lcnirellep0.837154.html 
IIP is planning more stories on biofuels which will be 
posted on the America.gov website as they become 
available. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR REQUESTING A NEW IV PROGRAM FROM ECA 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶4.  (U) OES agrees that your proposal for a new Southern 
Cone regional IV program on environmental law enforcement 
is a good idea, and we have consulted our public affairs 
staff on the mechanics of developing new IV programs. 
Our public affairs staff advises us that proposals for 
new International Visitors Leadership Projects must be 
proposed to ECA program offices directly from post PAOs 
or CAOs.  To suggest a new regional Southern Cone project 
on the theme of environmental law enforcement, posts 
should coordinate a draft proposal summary highlighting 
the compelling need and justification for the proposed 
project and submit it directly to ECA/PE/V/G/N Branch 
Chief Chris McShane.
