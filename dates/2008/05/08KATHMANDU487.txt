(SBU) On April 24, Emboff delivered reftel talking points to 
Rudra Nepal, Under Secretary for UN and International 
Organizations at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, encouraging 
the Government of Nepal (GON) to prohibit the travel of 
designated Iranian proliferators as authorized by UNSCR 1737, 
1747, and 1803.  Rudra Nepal assured Emboff that the GON 
supported the measure but was unable to specify any domestic 
procedures in place to ensure that designated individuals or 
those subject to "vigilance and restraint" are appropriately 
vetted and denied entry into Nepal.  The Under Secretary said 
he would convey U.S. interest in this matter to the Ministry 
of Home Affairs.
