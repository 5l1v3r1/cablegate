1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Regional Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) 
conducted a post shipment-verification (PSV) at Advanced Material 
Engineering, 601 Rifle Range Road, Singapore (AME). The items in 
question are 30 detonators exported on or about December 11, 2007 
and valued at USD 2,148.  The items are classified under Export 
Control Classification Number (ECCN) 3A232 and are controlled for 
nuclear nonproliferation (NP) reasons.  The exporter was RISI of 
Tracy California. 
 
¶3.  According to the Singapore companies registry, AME has been in 
existence since 1994.  Its paid-up share capital is the Singapore 
equivalent of USD 27 million.  The following Singapore nationals are 
listed as directors:  Low, Yee Kah, Jway, Ching Hua, Fong, Saik Hay, 
Wu, Tzu Chien, Gan, Boon Jin, Kwok, Wai Onn, Sew, Chee Jhuen and 
Tay, Kian Seng. Singapore Technologies Kinetics Ltd. is listed as 
the sole shareholder. 
 
¶4.  According to its website, Singapore Technologies Engineering 
Ltd. (ST Engineering) is the parent company of Singapore 
Technologies Kinetics (ST Kinetics) which is the parent company of 
AME.  ST Engineering group has over 100 subsidiaries and associated 
companies in 20 countries including the United States, Europe, 
China, Singapore and Australia.  ST Kinetics is the land systems and 
specialty vehicles arm of ST Engineering.  It is one of Asia's 
leading defense and specialty vehicles companies with sales of over 
USD 600 million in 2006.  AME designs and manufactures conventional 
and smart munitions, advanced protective materials as well as guided 
system components.  More information is available at www.stengg.com. 
 
 
¶5.  On April 21, 2008, the ECO, accompanied by a representative of 
Singapore Customs visited the company and met with Mr. Goh, Beng 
Kwang, Senior Manager.  Mr. Goh is responsible for export control 
compliance at AME.  He confirmed that the information on the 
company's web site was correct. 
 
¶6.  As to the particular item in question, Mr. Goh accompanied the 
ECO to inspect the items.  ECO notes that entry into the entire AME 
complex is very highly controlled.  He further noted that the items 
were kept under lock and key in a bunker.  ECO reviewed the 
application documentation for the shipment confirming receipt of the 
detonators.  ECO also inspected the box containing the detonators 
that remained under its original seal. According to Mr. Goh, the 
items are used to test metal bonding techniques.  Use of 
conventional detonators has not provided the necessary precision 
and, as a result, very high precision detonators were procured. 
 
¶7.  At the time visited, AME appeared to be a suitable recipient of 
the commodities shipped since AME cooperated with the PSV, provided 
ECO with access to the items and operates a line of business 
consistent with the their use.  Also, AME was well aware of U.S. 
export licensing rules and indicated its intent to comply with those 
rules.
