¶1. (SBU) Summary:  The Greater Toronto Airports Authority (GTAA) has 
expressed concern that staffing at U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection (CBP) Preclearance in Toronto will endanger growth plans 
at Pearson International Airport.  GTAA officials complain that 62 
new flights were recently denied access to U.S. CBP preclearance 
facilities at Pearson.  GTAA anticipates serving over 49 million 
passengers a year by 2020, a 56% increase over 2006 total passenger 
volumes of about 31 million passengers.  To handle the anticipated 
passenger growth, GTAA plans to add a sixth (and final) runway, use 
the currently moth-balled Infield Terminal to which passengers must 
be bussed, and further expand the new Terminal 1.  GTAA officials 
plan to move U.S. CBP preclearance facilities in Terminal 1 to a new 
location that would put U.S. officials behind airport security 
screening, significantly improving their safety.  GTAA is not 
considering a similar renovation for U.S. CBP preclearance 
operations in the older Terminal 3 in the next few years.  U.S. CBP 
has suggested GTAA encourage airlines to schedule new U.S.-bound 
flights during non-peak hours to increase the likelihood of access 
to preclearance services.  GTAA officials and Canadian airline 
executives hope the U.S. government will provide additional manpower 
to the U.S. CBP Toronto Pearson Preclearance facility to accommodate 
the growing passenger loads heading across the border to the U.S. 
End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) GTAA President and CEO Lloyd McCoomb expressed concern to 
Consul General Nay on April 17 that inadequate staffing at U.S. CBP 
Preclearance in Toronto is endangering growth plans by Canadian 
airlines and the GTAA.  McCoomb observed that passengers on 
U.S.-bound flights that cannot be cleared by U.S. CBP in Toronto 
have to be cleared on arrival in the U.S.  Some of these flights, he 
said, are heading to destinations with very small or remote CBP 
presences. 
 
¶3. (SBU) GTAA officials complained that U.S. CBP was unable to 
provide preclearance services to 62 flights coming out of Pearson 
Airport's older Terminal 3 at Pearson International Airport.  We 
later learned that these flights were all scheduled to depart during 
peak departure time to the U.S.  Toronto CBP Preclearance officials 
noted that they could have handled the passengers from these flights 
if they had been rescheduled to depart at other than peak U.S. 
departure times.  The flights included: 
 
--Canjet Flt#970 Saturday service to St. Petersburg, FL at 08:30 
from April 5-May 17 with a B737 -- 7 flights with 132 seats each 
denied. 
 
--Skyservice Flt #505 Friday service to Orlando, FL at 07:00 from 
May 2-Sept. 12 with a B752 -- 20 flights with 216 seats each denied. 
 
 
--Skyservice Flt #505 Saturday service to Orlando, FL at 07:45 from 
May 3-Oct. 25 with a B752 -- 26 flights with 216 seats each denied. 
 
 
--Air Transat Flt#506 Sunday service to Orlando at 06:25 on March 30 
with a A313 -- 1 flight with 260 seats denied. 
 
--Air Transat Flt#506 Sunday service to Orlando at 13:55 on April 
6-April 27 with a A313 -- 4 flights with 260 seats each denied. 
 
--Air Transat Flt#758 Friday service to Fort Lauderdale at 06:25 on 
April 4-April 25 with a A332 -- 4 flights with 362 seats each 
denied. 
 
¶4. (SBU) GTAA anticipates serving over 49 million passengers a year 
by 2020, a 56% increase over 2006 total passenger volumes of about 
31 million passengers.  GTAA estimates that the number of 
transborder passengers will increase 64% from 8.9 million in 2006 to 
about 14.6 million in 2020.  The number of international passengers 
is expected to grow 75% to 15 million in 2020, while the number of 
domestic passengers will grow a more modest 44% to 19.4 million in 
the same year. 
 
¶5. (SBU) GTAA officials say they have discussed their long-term 
growth plans (available at www.gtaa.com/en/gtaa_corporate/ 
publications/master_plan/) with Toronto-based U.S. CBP officials. 
To handle the anticipated passenger growth, GTAA plans to add a 
sixth (and final) runway, use the currently moth-balled Infield 
Terminal to which passengers must be bussed, and further expand the 
new Terminal 1. 
 
¶6. (SBU) McCoomb said GTAA plans to move U.S. CBP preclearance 
facilities in Terminal 1 to a new location that would put U.S. 
officials behind airport security screening, significantly improving 
their safety.  U.S.-bound passengers currently check in with 
airlines, then clear U.S. Customs while still carrying their 
baggage.  After leaving customs, passengers drop their bags and then 
 
TORONTO 00000148  002 OF 002 
 
 
clear airport security before proceeding to the gate area for their 
flight.  McCoomb said the GTAA has finished the concept definition 
of the project, is moving to the design development stage, and is on 
track to move U.S. CBP to the new location in about five years.  The 
new facility will enable passengers to check their luggage and be 
screened by airport security before proceeding through the U.S. CBP 
preclearance facility.  Passenger bags will be electronically 
photographed and tracked and will be retrievable should a U.S. CBP 
inspector wish to inspect the baggage before admitting a passenger. 
McCoomb admitted that a similar renovation for U.S. CBP preclearance 
operations in Terminal 3 is not anticipated in anytime soon (i.e. 
well beyond the five year planning horizon). 
 
¶7. (SBU) Comment:  U.S. CBP officials are encouraging Toronto-based 
airlines to continue to apply for preclearance services for new 
flights and plans to service new flights whenever possible.  U.S. 
CBP has suggested the GTAA promote the scheduling of new U.S.-bound 
flights during non-peak hours to increase the likelihood of 
approval.  GTAA officials and Canadian airline executives hope the 
U.S. government will also provide additional manpower to the Toronto 
Pearson Preclearance facility to accommodate the growing passenger 
loads heading across the border to the U.S.  The fact that CBP has 
been unable to provide pre-clearance to U.S.-bound flights departing 
during peak hours raises serious concerns for the GTAA and affected 
air carriers, given their growth projections.  They hope that 
trusted traveler programs like NEXUS will help increase U.S. CBP 
capacity, and recognize that more diffuse departure times will help, 
but believe that additional U.S. official manpower will be required 
to manage the growing passenger loads.  End Comment.
