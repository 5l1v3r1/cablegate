SUBJECT: SLOVAK FM KUBIS DISCUSSES AFGHANISTAN WITH 
AMBASSADOR KHALILZAD 
 
¶1. (SBU) In a May 13 meeting, Slovak FM Jan Kubis told 
Ambassador Khalilzad that he had just returned from a joint 
trip to Afghanistan with Dutch FM Verboken.  Kubis said he 
had found the situation in Afghanistan "unclear and 
unresolved."  Kubis speculated that the local Afghan 
population is unhappy with the looming uncertainty.  He 
stated that the Slovak Ministry of Defense has plans to 
increase its troop presence in Afghanistan from 100 plus to 
250-300, but this has not yet been approved by the Government 
of Slovakia.  Kubis stated that he hopes the upcoming Paris 
political conference on Afghanistan comes up with three or 
four priorities. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ambassador Khalilzad said that he has expressed 
concerns to President Karzai regarding political polarization 
as governance is a key issue for Afghanistan.  Khalilzad 
asked Kubis for his assessment of Uruzgan Province.  Kubis 
responded that governance is clearly the biggest problem and 
the absence of a UN presence in Uruzgan Province is also an 
issue.  Khalilzad noted that recent U.S. actions included 
adjusting UNAMA's mandate to sharpen its focus and giving new 
UNAMA SRSG Kai Eide more staff in the field.  He said that 
the U.S. had also asked Eide for a proposed timeline on 
implementing tasks in the UNAMA mandate.  Khalilzad stressed 
that we are working in the ACABQ to pass a benefits package 
that will encourage more UN staff to take unfilled positions 
Afghanistan. 
 
¶3. (SBU) On Kosovo, Kubis said that Slovakia will not remain 
alone if all other EU members other than Cyprus are ready to 
recognize it.  However, he said he did not see such a 
situation yet.  Ambassador Khalilzad asked Kubis if Slovakia 
would be re-engaging in Iraq.  Kubis responded that Slovakia 
is looking at ways to get involved in economic projects, but 
will not re-engage on military or police matters because of a 
previously made political decision in Bratislava.
