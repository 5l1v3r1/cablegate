(sbu) Canada plans to be represented at the "political level" 
-- possibly by Deputy Foreign Minister Leonard Edwards -- at 
the May 29 International Compact with Iraq Ministerial in 
Stockholm, according to Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade's Deputy Director for Iran/Iraq Jeffrey McLaren. 
McLaren stated that Canada had no plans to pledge new funds 
in Stockholm, but noted that Canada had recently earmarked 
$15 million to the International Reconstruction Fund Facility 
for Iraq (IRFFI) from Canada's overall $300 million allocated 
for Iraq reconstruction (see ref d).  This $15 million, he 
said, brings Canada's total IRFFI contributions to $115 
million.  (Comment:  Ref b provides an insight into Canada's 
view of funding Iraqi reconstruction and ref c notes that 
Canada has taken in double its allotted number of Iraqi 
refugees.  End Comment)
