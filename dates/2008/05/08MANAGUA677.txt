SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  In April 2008, the Government of Nicaragua (GON) did not report 
the resolution of any Embassy registered property claims.  During 
the April 24 Property Working Group meeting, the GON confirmed the 
dismissal of 84 claims in February and March based on anti-Somoza 
Decree 38.  The widow and legal heir of a U.S. citizen withdrew 1 
claim from the Embassy property database because her family did not 
have the necessary documents to support the claim.  With the 
inclusion of 1 withdrawn claim in April, the Property Office 
database now includes 656 pending registered property claims 
belonging to 309 Amcits.  To date, most resolutions have involved 
compensation via government-issued indemnification bonds ("bonos de 
pago de indemnizacion" or BPIs).  As of March 31, 2008, the GON has 
issued BPIs with a face value of $324,059,784 to Embassy-registered 
claimants.  Since taking office in January 2007, the Ortega 
administration has resolved a total of 17 claims, 12 during this 
waiver year. 
 
GON DISMISSES 84 MORE U.S. CLAIMS 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶2. During the April 24 monthly Property Working Group meeting, the 
GON confirmed the dismissal of 84 claims based on Decree 38 
mentioned in letters dated February 26 and March 31 from Attorney 
General Hernan Estrada to the Ambassador (Ref A).  Decree 38 
authorized the GON to confiscate property of individuals deemed to 
have been "allies of Somoza."  However, during the Ambassador's May 
9 meeting with the Attorney General, Estrada said that he would meet 
with claimants to determine if the decree is indeed applicable to 
their cases. 
 
U.S. CLAIMANT WITHDRAWS ONE CLAIM - NO DOCUMENTS 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶3. On April 2, 2008, Mrs. Julia Bustamante, the widow and legal heir 
of U.S. citizen Octavio Bustamante, requested that the Property 
Office remove 1 Embassy-registered claim from our database because 
she did not have the necessary documents to support the claim.  We 
have updated our database to reflect this withdrawn claim.
