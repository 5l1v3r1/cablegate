SUBJECT: KONY FAILS TO MEET NORTHERN UGANDAN LEADERS 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) leader Joseph Kony failed to 
meet with his negotiating team and northern Ugandan religious 
leaders and elders at Rikwangba, which had been set originally for 
May 10.  Kony did not show up on May 10 reportedly due to the LRA's 
own internal meetings in Garamba National Park.  The northern 
leaders were assured by LRA negotiating team leader, James Obita, 
that Kony would arrive at Rikwangba on May 11.  He failed to 
materialize.  Beginning May 11, all communications between the LRA 
in the field and the LRA delegation ceased, even at the lowest 
levels. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The northern leaders, LRA negotiating team, and GOU were 
trying to piece together the series of events and telephone 
conversations to determine what happened.  The northern leaders were 
furious, according to Warner Tan Kate, political advisor to U.N. 
Special Envoy for LRA-Affected Areas Chissano.  They departed 
Nabanga, which had no water supply, for Juba on May 14.  On May 15, 
some of the delegates may meet with Government of Southern Sudan 
mediator Riek Machar to discuss the next steps.  Post will continue 
to follow the situation closely.
