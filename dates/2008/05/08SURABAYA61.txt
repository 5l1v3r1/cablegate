SUBJECT: EAST JAVA: PRESIDENT YUDHOYONO OPENS EDUCATION DAY AMID 
STUDENT PROTESTS 
 
¶1.  (U) Summary: President Yudhoyono visited East Java May 12-13 
May for National Education Day opening ceremonies at Airlangga 
University in Surabaya.  The President was greeted by 
small-scale student protests calling for reduction in fuel and 
food prices, expulsion of foreign oil companies and a solution 
to the Sidoarjo mudflow disaster.  Consulate Surabaya attended 
opening ceremonies at which the President put forward a vision 
for Indonesian education, albeit in broad strokes.  With the 
national spotlight on local education, East Java officials have 
admitted that illiteracy is a significant problem.  End Summary 
 
¶2.  (U) Police prevented a few hundred student protestors 
greeting the Presidential motorcade from entering the campus at 
Airlangga University.  The students held signs demanding a 
reduction in fuel and food prices, a new government economic 
team, an end to foreign oil and gas operations and finally a 
solution to the Sidoarjo mudflow disaster.  The protestors 
represented various local universities and a wide range of 
student groups including: The Indonesian Muslim University 
Student Committee for Action (KAMMI); The Indonesian Muslim 
Students Association (HMI); The Nadhlatul Ulama Student Movement 
(PMII); The National Movement of Indonesian University Students 
(GMNI); and The Christian University Student's Movement (GMKI). 
No mention was made of the protests at the ceremony. 
 
Awards for "Educational Heroes" 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (U) In a 12 May speech opening ceremonies on Indonesia's 
National Education Day, President Yudhoyono praised the teachers 
of Indonesia particularly those who "struggle in isolated 
areas--they are the real heroes."  In his introductory remarks, 
the Minister of Education Bambang Sudibyo explained that East 
Java had made strides in education and Airlangga is a leading 
university and a natural fit for the event.  The Governors of 
Central Java, West Sumatra and Riau were also given awards for 
excellence in managing education in their provinces. 
 
A Vision Built on Buzzwords 
--------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (U) After thanking the teachers of Indonesia for their hard 
work, the President explained the desired goals of educational 
reform without offering a detailed plan.  In a speech peppered 
with English buzzwords, the president exhorted educators to 
produce students who are: "self-generating", "self-developing" 
and "independent."  He stressed that Indonesia must foster a 
"critical mass" of citizens who can create a "knowledge-based 
society", full of "intellectual curiosity."  A "world class 
university" and an "open university" are key parts of the 
strategy, he said.  Apparently referring to resolve and 
determination, the President called on his audience not to be 
either (in English) "permissive" (or now in Indonesian) "lunak" 
(soft).  "A permissive nation cannot become a developed nation". 
 Having set these goals, the President was vague on how they 
might be achieved. 
 
East Java Can't Read 
-------------------- 
 
¶5.  (U) 4.5 million East Javans over the age of 15 are 
illiterate, making the province among the least literate in 
Indonesia according to Head of East Java Education and Culture 
Office Rasiyo, as quoted by local media on May 11.  Bambang 
Sudibyo, the Minister of Education told local media that 
illiteracy in East Java is 11.97 percent, well beyond the 
national average of 5 percent.  Rasiyo reminded the press that 
since 75 percent or 3.5 million illiterate citizens are 65 or 
older, many lack the motivation to learn at this point in their 
lives.  The highest rates of illiteracy are found in the 
Regencies of Malang, Probolinggo, Sumenep and Pamekasan.  East 
Java is ranked fifth in illiteracy behind Papua, West Nusa 
Tenggara, South Sulawesi and Bali.  Education Minister Sudibyo 
said that reducing the rate is "homework" for East Java's 
Education and Culture Office.
