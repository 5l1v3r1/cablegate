¶1. (SBU) This is another in a series of weekly reports on PKK 
violence in Turkey.  Our primary source is the Turkish General Staff

well as casualties incurred. 
 
¶2. (U) During the April 24-30, 2008 reporting period, seven security 
officials died, including two in landmine explosions and the rest in 
clashes with the PKK.  One of the two who were killed when they 
stepped on a landmine was a village guard.  Three additional 
security personnel were injured, all in landmine explosions.  The 
total number of security force casualties for the year through April 
30, 2008 was 37 killed and 42 injured. 
 
¶3. (U) During the same reporting period, three PKK terrorists were 
killed, two were captured, and nine surrendered.  Of the two killed, 
one was found dead in Nusaybin, Mardin Province on April 28. 
According to official TGS website figures, through the fourth week 
of April, the number of PKK militants killed this year was 316, the 
number of those captured was 86, and the number of those who 
surrendered was 58.
