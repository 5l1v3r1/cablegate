Sichuan Earthquake 
------------------ 
 
¶2. During the May 15, 2008 regular MFA press briefing, spokesperson 
Qin Gang said many countries have offered to send assistance and 
rescue teams to China following the May 12 earthquake in Sichuan. 
The Chinese Government and people are grateful for the offers of 
support.  When asked for specific relief needs, Qin said China 
requires housing material, communications equipment and medical 
supplies.  China has so far received offers totaling approximately 
$100 million and more than $10 million in supplies, Qin stated. 
 
¶3. China has agreed to allow a Japanese rescue team to travel to the 
disaster area and is considering similar requests from other 
countries, Qin said.  China views Japan's offer as a gesture of 
"friendly affection" and appreciates the support of the Japanese 
Government and people.  When asked why China did not accept rescue 
teams from South Korea and Australia, Qin said local authorities are 
still assessing the situation. 
 
¶4. When asked if the earthquake damaged nuclear facilities in the 
Sichuan area, Qin said he is not aware of any such damage and 
directed questions to the relevant Chinese authorities. 
 
Foreign Tourists in Sichuan 
--------------------------- 
 
¶5. According to the Tourism Board, Qin said, there were 93 foreign 
tourists in Sichuan during the earthquake and all are "basically 
safe."  However, contact has yet to be made with 41 of the tourists. 
 The Chinese Government is in close contact with relevant embassies 
regarding 12 American, 31 British and two Israeli tourists. 
 
MFA Reporting Trip to Earthquake Affected Areas 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶6. Qin says the MFA is organizing a trip for foreign media to 
earthquake affected areas.  Qin said 35 news agencies are already 
reporting from the area.  He expressed hope that foreign reporters 
would tell the world the "true" story of how the Chinese Government 
and people are "united to meet the needs" of those affected by the 
disaster. 
 
Burma Cyclone Disaster Relief 
----------------------------- 
 
¶7. Asked to comment on reports that Burma was diverting aid from 
cyclone victims, Qin said the international community should 
"respect the will of the Burmese."  Describing Burma as a friendly 
neighbor of China, Qin expressed China's empathy for the victims of 
the cyclone disaster and said he hopes the international community 
and Burma can agree "through friendly consultations" on the aid 
Burma needs.
