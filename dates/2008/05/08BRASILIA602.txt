SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERED: U.S. CANDIDATE FOR 
INTERAMERICAN JURIDICAL COMMITTEE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 45616 
 
Â¶1. (U) Poloff delivered reftel demarche on May 6 to the 
Ministry of Exterior Relations OAS Division Secretary Luciano 
Rego, who noted that they were aware of the U.S. candidacy 
and would take a careful look at the non-paper and C.V. 
Rego noted that the GoB already made commitments to the 
Paraguayan and Peruvian candidates and would now have to 
decide between the Canadian and U.S. candidate.  Unprompted, 
Rego commented that he considered it important that  someone 
from the U.S. serve on the committee.  Finally, he added that 
the GoB might be open to a vote exchange, but the Ministry 
first would have to deliberate internally to see if there are 
any outstanding Brazilian candidacies on which to exchange 
votes.
