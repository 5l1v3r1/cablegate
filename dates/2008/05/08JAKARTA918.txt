¶1. (SBU) The Government of Indonesia said May 8 that it will 
institute greater scrutiny on mining export shipments beginning in 
July, according to a senior trade ministry official.  GOI officials 
say they want to curb illegal exports of coal, as well as copper, 
nickel, bauxite, lead, zinc and gold ores and concentrates.  A 
similar clampdown on tin in February 2007 resulted in tighter 
supplies and global prices hitting 20-year highs. In 2006, 
Indonesian tin exports were 118,555 tons worth $913 million. After 
the regulation, tin exports dropped to 86,304 tons but rose in value 
to $1.2 billion, according to government data. 
 
¶2. (SBU) GOI officials said they will pay greater attention to 
verifying the export volumes reported by miners as well as the 
quality of ore and condensate exports.  Under the current system, 
exporters provide reports to customs, which makes little effort to 
reconcile actual shipments with the declarations.  Our contacts say 
the GOI is particularly concerned about losing revenue from coal 
exports, given the doubling of global coal prices in the last year 
and the surging volumes of Indonesian thermal coal exports. 
Indonesia produced almost 200 million metric tons of coal in 2007 
and exported almost 80 percent of that production. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Several of our expatriate mining contacts expressed mixed 
reviews of the new policy, but tempered their remarks given the 
limited amount of information the GOI released on their plans.  They 
noted Indonesia has a long history of announcing export taxes and 
other types of controls only to let them lapse or withdraw them in 
the face of public criticism.  In general, our mining company 
contacts welcome higher prices but worry that continued strong 
increases on global markets may lower world growth, which will 
eventually cause the minerals boom to bust.  They also expressed 
concerns about GOI backsliding on investment climate issues.  They 
see a danger of complacency stemming from the higher revenues and 
fear it will prompt GOI officials to continue pursuing policies that 
suppress even further the already anemic levels of minerals 
exploration investment.
