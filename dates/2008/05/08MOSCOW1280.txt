SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERED: UNSC RESOLUTION ON SOMALI 
PIRACY 
 
REF: STATE 47531 
 
We delivered reftel demarche to MFA Senior Counselor for 
International Organizations Petr Ilichev on May 6.  Ilichev 
said that the GOR supported UNSC action to assist in the 
fight against piracy in Somali waters and would support the 
proposed UNSC resolution with certain changes: 
 
-- Paragraph 6:  The GOR is concerned that the reference to 
"States cooperating" with the Transitional Federal Government 
of Somalia is overly broad and could be used by any country 
to justify entering Somali waters. 
 
-- Paragraph 6b: The GOR suggests adding language that would 
make those "boarding, searching and seizing vessels" liable 
for the safety of the crew and cargo on those vessels. 
Language similar to that used in UNSCR 1803 on Iran would 
suffice. 
 
-- Paragraph 12:  The GOR will propose striking the 
"possibility of extending the measures provided by the 
present resolution to other areas affected by piracy."
