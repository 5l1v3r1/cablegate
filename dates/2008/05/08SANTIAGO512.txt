SUBJECT: CHILE'S POLICE CHIEF DIES IN HELICOPTER CRASH IN PANAMA 
 
¶1. (U) Summary: Chile's police chief, Director General Jose 
Bernales, his wife and some members of his delegation, died on May 
29, when their helicopter crashed into a three-story building in 
Panama City.  General Bernales and his delegation were attending a 
United Nations-sponsored conference on terrorism in Panama City. 
Bernales was committed to cooperation with the USG on transnational 
crime issues and will be missed, but we expect that cooperation to 
survive his tragic demise.  End summary. 
 
Helicopter Crash Kills Chilean Police and Panamanians 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶2. (U) In Panama City on May 29th, 2008, Director General of 
Carabineros, Jose A. Bernales (59), his wife Ms. Teresa Bianchini, 
Carabinero Lieutenant Colonels Oscar Tapia and Ricardo Orozco, 
Captain Mauricio Fuenzalida, and Tapia's wife, Carolina Reyes, died 
in a helicopter crash while on an official visit to Panama. 
According to Chilean press, after failed attempts to land, the 
helicopter crashed into a three-floor department store in the highly 
populated Caledonia neighborhood.  Panamanian police confirmed the 
death of at least four Panamanians at the site of the accident and 
many others were rushed to hospitals. 
 
¶3. (SBU) General Bernales and his delegation were in Panama 
attending a UN-sponsored conference on terrorism.  The 12-seat 
helicopter (UH 1N) was built in 1973 and purchased (for $1) by 
former President of Panama Omar Torrijos, father of the current 
President Martin Torrijos.  The Embassy has heard unconfirmed 
reports that the helicopter experienced other mechanical problems 
when flying with Panama's Vice President eight weeks ago, and had to 
make a hasty, unplanned landing. 
 
¶4. (U) President Bachelet decreed three days of national mourning 
and flags were lowered to half-staff.  Bachelet called General 
Bernales, who had served as Chile's chief of the police since 2005, 
"a great police director, an important support for the GOC on order 
and security matters."  In November 2007, General Bernales was 
selected as the first President of AMERIPOL (Police of the Americas) 
by the representatives of the 18 member countries. 
 
Bernales: A Modernizer 
---------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) Bernales did much to modernize the Carabineros, leading them 
to improve their efforts to target transnational and organized 
crime, for example.  Under his leadership, the Carabineros 
significantly upgraded their airwing and groundfleet capabilities, 
personnel protection equipment, and forensic and electronic 
surveillance capabilities.  Improvements to their investigative 
capabilities included an Integrated Automated Fingerprint 
Identification System (IAFIS) and the development of an integrated 
criminal database.  Bernales actively labored to raise the 
capabilities of the Carabineros to recognized international 
standards, implementing modern concepts such as community policing 
and proactive police resource allocation and deployment strategies. 
 
 
 
A Friend of the Embassy 
------------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) Bernales was a close contact of the Embassy.  The Carabineros 
collaborate with various sections within the Mission on law 
enforcement and national security issues such as counterterrorism 
and transnational criminal activity.  Under Bernales' leadership the 
Embassy saw an unprecedented level of cooperation with Carabineros 
on law enforcement issues.  He met frequently with Embassy law 
enforcement officials and, on several occasions, with the 
Ambassador.  Bernales personally sought and realized a formal 
agreement of cooperation between the Carabineros and the FBI.  A 
Carabinero liaison officer works closely with the Regional Security 
Office to coordinate security support and Carabineros are posted 24 
hours a day at both the Chancery and the Chief of Mission Residence. 
 In response to demonstrations and security incidents directed at 
the Embassy, the Carabinero response has consistently been swift, 
professional, and measured.  In January 2008, the Carabineros' 
anti-narcotics unit (OS-7) requested, for the first time, DEA's 
support in efforts to combat the alarming surge in transnational 
cocaine trafficking along Chile's northern border with Bolivia.  In 
early May, OS-7 commanders contacted the Embassy with a request to 
obtain DEA-provided training for their investigators. 
 
¶7. (U) Ambassador Simons has authorized the Embassy to lower its 
flag to half-staff in recognition of the national mourning period 
for Director General Bernales.  He also expressed his condolences in 
phone calls to Defense Minister Goni and Interior Minister Perez 
Yoma, and is sending a letter to President Bachelet.  Senior Embassy 
staff attended a May 30 mass at the Carabinero training school, and 
the Ambassador will attend the funeral mass currently scheduled for 
Sunday, June 1. 
 
¶8. (U) General Eduardo Gordon will act as the temporary head of the 
Carabineros until President Bachelet names a formal successor for 
Bernales.  Gordon had been a low-profile Carabinero officer until 
Bernales appointed him to be his second-in-command in December 2005. 
Prior to that appointment he served as the Chief of Carabineros in 
Valparaiso. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) Chileans are in shock at the death of the leader of their 
much loved Carabineros.  In polls, Chileans regularly rank 
Carabineros as the most trusted of public institutions, and the 
country is now in mourning.  Bernales is famous for bring the 
Carabineros and Chilean community together.  Though the Embassy has 
lost a committed partner in the fight against trasnational crime, we 
do not anticipate Bernales' death to result in a deterioration of 
daily cooperation.  The Embassy has institution-wide relationships 
with the Carabineros.
