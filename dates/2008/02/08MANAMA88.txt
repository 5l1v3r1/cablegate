(SBU) DCM spoke with MFA Under Secretary for bilateral 
affairs Sheikh Abdul Aziz al Khalifa February 7 concerning 
UNIFIL.  Pol/Econ Chief followed up with MFA Americas Desk 
Officer Hind Kamal on February 11 to encourage the GOB to 
contribute to the UNIFIL mission (reftel).  Both replied that 
the GOB supported the UN's role in Lebanon, but said that it 
was unlikely Bahrain would be able to contribute troops to 
UNIFIL.
