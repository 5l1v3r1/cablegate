¶1. (SBU) On February 22, 2008 we formally demarched Director General 
of Sea Transportation Effendi Batubara, Director of Sea Transport 
Djoni Algamar and Head of Section for Security Affairs Mukhlis 
Tohepaly that the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) will issue a Port Security 
Advisory (PSA) effective on or about February 26, 2008 and that 
conditions of entry will be imposed two weeks later on vessels 
coming to the U.S. from within five port calls of non-exempt 
Indonesian ports.  The Directorate General of Sea Transportation 
(DGST) officials accepted the demarche with minor protest and 
expressed interest in continued cooperation with the U.S. on 
improving Indonesia's port security. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Batubara raised one main point of contention. He complained 
that the PSA would apply to all non-exempt Indonesian ports when 
USCG checked International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) 
Code compliance at just 22 port facilities, only six of which USCG 
found to be insufficiently compliant.  He considered 22 port 
facilities out of hundreds to be too small of a sample, especially 
considering that only a minority of those were not ISPS 
Code-compliant. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Batubara and his staff did not object to waiving the 
Recognized Security Organization (RSO) requirement for private ports 
operated by Chevron, Newmont and British Petroleum.  However, 
Tohepaly faulted the USCG for not coordinating meetings and visits 
with private ports through the Directorate General of Sea 
Transportation (DGST).  Tohepaly said that, according to the ISPS 
Code, all compliance issues should be directed to the "designated 
authority." 
 
¶4. (SBU) Batubara said that DGST's priority was to gain exemption 
for the six public port facilities that USCG previously visited and 
found to be non-compliant.  Algamar requested a format for the 
Alternative Security Procedure Process (ASPP) report and a list of 
approved RSOs.  Algamar requested that Port Security Liaison Officer 
Lieutenant Commander Philemon Purganan meet with Indonesian RSOs on 
his next visit to Indonesia to discuss the ASPP.  Algamar also asked 
for the schedule of the next USCG visit to Indonesia. 
 
¶5. (SBU) DGST officials did not discuss the economic impact of the 
PSA.  In a January 18, 2008 meeting, Ministry of Trade officials 
told us they did not know what the impact would be, but, if 
necessary, shippers would redirect their cargo to exempted ports or 
consolidate their shipments outside of Indonesia.  In a meeting on 
February 22, 2008, Australian Department of Transportation officials 
said, although they are concerned, they do not have a clear idea of 
the PSA's impact on Australian shipments to the U.S. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Algamar asked for capacity building to help his staff 
perform the regulatory function over ISPS Code compliance and port 
security generally.  We told them the USG is committed to the 
long-term goal of helping Indonesian ports achieve ISPS Code 
compliance in order to remove the PSA.
