¶1.  Consulate General Munich wishes to express its appreciation for 
the assistance provided by Mission Germany colleagues in supporting 
the 44th Munich Security Conference. 
 
¶2.  Attending the Conference were three heads of government, 20 
foreign ministers, and 23 defense ministers.  The U.S. delegation 
held 21 bilateral and multilateral meetings and engaged more than 60 
media outlets in a dozen press events.  U.S. participation was 
substantial, with a total delegation of 223, including Secretary of 
Defense Gates, CODEL Lieberman with two U.S. Senators, three members 
of the House of Representatives and one governor, EUR Assistant 
Secretary Fried, VCI Assistant Secretary DeSutter, Ambassador to 
 
SIPDIS 
Germany Timken, Ambassador to NATO Nuland, Ambassador to Belarus 
Stewart, DAS Kramer, DAS Butler, and other senior USG 
representatives.  The delegation's collective focus on engaging the 
40 German Bundestag members attending invigorated the dialogue about 
NATO's success and shortcomings in Afghanistan. 
 
¶3.  In particular, post would like to recognize the following 
Mission Germany offices/individuals who assisted with the 
conference.  Without their assistance and teamwork, our Mission 
could not have made the important participation by senior U.S. 
Government officials at the conference a success: 
 
- Ambassador Timken:  for leadership that successfully prioritized 
intensive engagement of German Bundestag members by delegation 
members. 
 
- DCM John Koenig:  for outstanding strategic guidance in planning 
the U.S. delegation's engagements at the conference. 
 
- Berlin DATT/ODC (David Allwine, Richard Naughton, Dan Stiver): 
for assisting in coordination with the Office of the Secretary of 
Defense. 
 
- Berlin GSO (Thorsten Kirch, Michael Schumann, Wolf Meyer):  for 
providing excellent chauffeur services in an extremely difficult 
traffic/security environment, and assisting with coordination and 
set-up of bilateral meeting rooms. 
 
- Berlin PA (Robert Wood, Maja Boehm, Nancy Rajczak, Julia 
Sebastian):  for arranging press interviews with more than sixty 
media outlets for U.S. participants, including Defense Secretary 
Gates, Ambassador Timken, Ambassador Nuland, and Assistant Secretary 
Dan Fried; assisting with CODEL press requests; providing rapid 
transcriptions of Secretary Gates' remarks; tracking and 
disseminating media reaction; and quickly   uploading photos and 
speeches to the Mission's public websites 
(http://munich.usconsulate.gov). 
 
- Berlin Pol-Mil (Bill Moeller, Ken Kero, Thorsten Schulz):  for 
note taking during conference sessions and bilateral meetings, 
providing rapid, detailed reporting to Washington.  Additionally Ken 
Kero's early arrival allowed control officer Tom Kelsey to 
participate in PRT training at Ft. Bragg. 
 
- Jeff Rathke (Berlin POL):  for serving as a liaison with the 
German Foreign Office and supporting A/S Fried during the 
conference. 
 
- Sam Ward (ARSO Berlin):  for critical protection of principal 
VIPs.
