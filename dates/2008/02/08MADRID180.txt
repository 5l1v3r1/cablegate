SUBJECT: SPAIN: CI/KR RESPONSE FOR S/CT 
 
REF: STATE 6461 
 
¶1. (SBU) Per REFTEL, Embassy Madrid's Counterterrorism 
Working Group has collectively taken inventory of Spain's 
critical infrastructure and key resources and does not 
believe that the country possesses any CI/KR that, if 
destroyed, disrupted, or exploited, would have an immediate 
and deleterious effect on the United States.  Since the 
Madrid train bombings of March 11, 2004, the Spanish 
government has taken steps to better defend itself against a 
future terrorist attack.  In recent months, critical 
infrastructure protection, both physical and cyber, has 
become a priority interest for the GOS with the establishment 
of a national center to assess and protect critical 
infrastructure.  Under the auspices of the Spanish Ministry 
of Interior's Secretary of State for Security, the Spanish 
government created in late 2007 the National Center of 
Critical Infrastructure Protection (Centro Nacional de 
Proteccion de Infraestructuras Criticas - CNPIC).  The 
center's director is Fernando Sanchez Gomez, a former Civil 
Guard officer with over 20 years of experience. 
 
¶2. (SBU) According to an internal CNPIC document provided to 
the Embassy, the center's mandate includes: 
 
-- Maintaining and updating the GOS' Plan for Critical 
Infrastructure Security and National Catalog of Strategic 
Infrastructure 
 
-- Gathering, analyzing, integrating and evaluating 
information from public institutions, police departments, 
strategic sectors and international cooperation 
 
-- Providing threat assessments on and risk analysis of 
strategic installations 
 
-- Creating a mechanism for information sharing, streamlined 
communications, and alert warnings 
 
-- Command and control support through an Operations Room 
when triggered by an alert 
 
-- Establishing a national point of contact within the 
European Program for Critical Infrastructure Protection 
 
¶3. (SBU) CNPIC officials told us their nascent center 
currently has a few knowledge gaps, including how to best 
collaborate and interact with the private sector, and how to 
integrate the protection of both physical security and cyber 
security into a single entity.  They asked for our assistance 
in arranging an official visit to Washington to learn first 
hand from elements of the Department of Homeland Security how 
our CI protection has evolved in recent years.  A small group 
of Spanish technical experts will travel to the U.S. during 
the week of February 18 to meet with a variety of officials 
tasked with protecting U.S. critical infrastructure.  The 
group is scheduled to meet with DHS' Center for 
Infrastructure Protection and visit TSA's Freedom Center. 
Embassy Madrid appreciates DHS' efforts to organize this 
visit and to educate our Spanish counterparts on critical 
infrastructure protection.  Post will report further as the 
CNPIC carries out its mandate.
