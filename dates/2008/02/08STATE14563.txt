¶1.  Action Requests:  Ambassador or appropriate senior 
embassy official is requested to deliver the text in 
paragraph 4 as a letter over Post Official's signature 
to either the host government's Foreign minister or, 
if known, the host government's designated Minister-level 
head of official delegation to WIREC 2008.  Post at its 
discretion may cc other ministers who have indicated an 
interest in attending WIREC.  Post is asked to confirm 
delivery of the letter via return cable.  Please include 
name and contact information for post's WIREC POC in the 
response cable. 
 
¶2.  Post is requested to inform the Host government that 
Official Individual Country Ministerial-level delegations may

of 
up to three Ministers, including the Ministers of Foreign 
Affairs, Energy, Agriculture, or Environment (or the 
equivalent 
Ministers covering those portfolios) and three subnational 
government representatives.  We defer to Tunisia's Minister 
of Foreign Affairs (MFA) to determine their country's precise 
makeup of the 'Official WIREC Ministerial Delegation,' as 
well 
as to inform us of their 'Head of Delegation,' assuming more 
than one Minister-level delegate is part of the official 
delegation.  However, we appreciate Embassy engagement with 
the 
MFA to ensure that the delegation is comprised of appropriate 
Ministers and subnational government representatives.

TEXT OF LETTER

¶4.  Begin text of the letter: 
 
Dear Mr./Madam Minister: (or other appropriate salutation) 
 
The U.S. State Department will host the Washington 
International 
Renewable Energy Conference (WIREC 2008) in Washington on 
March 
4-6, 2008.  WIREC 2008 is the third global ministerial-level 
event on renewable energy after Bonn in 2004 and Beijing in 
¶2005.  WIREC will serve as a global platform for ministers 
And senior leaders from the private sector, sub-national 
governments, and civil society to discuss and share 
information about the benefits of renewable energy, 
identify best practices and barriers, and consider 
policy options and measures needed to encourage the rapid 
development of renewable energy in their countries. 
 
I am pleased to invite (insert name of country) to send an 
official delegation to WIREC 2008.  Approximately 2,000 
delegates will participate in the three-day conference at 
the Washington Convention Center, and we envision 
participation 
by U.S. Cabinet secretaries and senior White House officials. 
 
In the spirit of the International Action Program that was 
agreed to at the Bonn Conference, I am inviting your 
government 
to consider making a voluntary national pledge at WIREC to 
accelerate the deployment of renewable energy in your country. 
The consolidation of national governments' pledges, as 
well as pledges from other major stakeholders (sub-national 
governments, international organizations, the private sector, 
civil 
society, and multi-stakeholder partnerships) will be one of 
the 
major outcomes of WIREC. 
 
I look forward to your official delegation's active 
participation 
in WIREC 2008. 
 
Sincerely, 
(insert name of Ambassador or appropriate senior 
embassy official) 
 
End text.
