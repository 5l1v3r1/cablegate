¶1. (SBU) Per reftel, ESTH Counselor advised officials in the 
Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Division of the Department 
of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) that the 
U.S. would not circulate a draft NSG policy statement 
regarding India until the Government of India and the IAEA 
had finalized the safeguards agreement.  Speaking personally, 
they thought delaying circulation of an edited statement made 
sense, but wondered within what sort of time frame after the 
completion of the safeguards agreement we would hope to 
circulate a draft and secure NSG concurrence.  They advised 
they would consider the draft when received and develop a 
Canadian government position at that time.  (Last fall, DFAIT 
officials had said they would not pursue development of a 
specific position on our first draft of the NSG policy 
exception statement until the safeguards agreement was closer 
to finalization.) 
 
¶2. (SBU) Our contacts continued that Canada is particularly 
interested in possible implications of the IAEA-India 
agreement on safeguards for Canadian-origin material and 
equipment.  Canada wants the safeguards in place for its 
material and equipment in India preserved without diminution.
