REF: ANKARA 147 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1. The Ministry of Agriculture announced on February 4th, that there 
is a new outbreak of Avian Influenza in the country.  This outbreak 
is in Samsun province on the Black Sea, about 400 Kilometers east of 
Zonguldak, where the last outbreak occurred. 
 
¶2. On January 28, Ministry officials were informed about a possible 
case of Avian Influenza (AI) in dead backyard poultry in the 19 May 
District of Samsun Province.  Ministry provincial officials went to 
the location, started quarantine measures, and took samples from the 
suspicious birds on the same day.  The initial laboratory tests 
results confirmed that the birds were infected with AI. 
 
¶3. The infected area is situated near a wetland area and the 
backyard poultry live in close contact with wild birds.  The source 
of disease is most probably the wild water birds. 
 
¶4. A total of 37 backyard poultry owned by eight families in the 
village, were culled as a precautionary measure in the area on the 
first day.  The Ministry stated that it has taken all other 
necessary measures.  Surveillance and quarantine measures in the 
area are continuing. 
 
¶5. It is not yet clear if this is H5N1 strain of the AI virus. 
 
¶6. Comment: At this point, everything seems to be under control. 
However, Embassy Ag office is concerned of possible economic effects 
if more cases develop and they are in Western Turkey close to the 
commercial poultry operations.  Currently, the two outbreaks have 
only affected a small number of birds and have been in villages far 
from commercial facilities.
