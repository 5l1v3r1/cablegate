SUBJECT: TENY COMMENTS ON NCP-SPLM EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, AEC, AND 
OIL 
 
REF: KHARTOUM 193 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY:  In a February 11 meeting with econoffs, 
Angelina Teny, State Minister at the Ministry of Energy and Mining 
and wife of GoSS Vice President Riek Machar, outlined the SPLM's 
priorities for the next round of discussions at the joint NCP-SPLM 
political executive committee, naming the census, elections, Darfur, 
and the overall SPLM-NCP relationship as top issues.  Teny also 
discussed the work of the Assessment and Evaluation Committee and 
the oil industry.  With respect to the latter, Teny called for a 
more organized system for transferring oil revenues to the south, 
for more southern representation within the oil industry, and for a 
fully functional National Petroleum Commission.  END SUMMARY. 
 
POLITICAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE 
----------------------------- 
¶2.  (SBU)  Teny opened the meeting stating that there are four 
pressing issues facing the SPLM in the joint political executive 
committee, the SPLM-NCP negotiating committee formed upon the return 
of the SPLM to the Government of National Unity.  (Note: Teny is one 
representative of the SPLM in this committee.  She stated that she 
removed herself from the last round of talks as she was "exhausted" 
by previous meetings. End Note.)  Teny said that SPLM 
representatives would discuss the census in the February 11 meeting, 
as they want information on ethnicity, residence, and religion 
included on the forms.  She stated that the SPLM never formally 
agreed to the current forms that have already been printed. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Teny also said that the SPLM will discuss elections in the 
political executive committee, adding that the SPLM has not decided 
whether to form an alliance with the NCP.  Teny stated that without 
an improvement in Darfur, completion of the census and elections may 
be impossible and that the SPLM realizes that stabilizing Darfur is 
in its own interests.  Although not offering details, Teny said that 
the SPLM also hopes to address its overall relationship with the 
NCP.  Teny said that she has also encouraged the committee to 
discuss Abyei, as the parties need to be consulted on this issue and 
"no one will accept a decision made only by the presidency."  Teny 
stated that she views the political executive committee as 
"complementary" to the AEC, as the AEC is there to observe and "not 
make political decisions." 
 
ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION COMMITTEE 
----------------------------------- 
¶4.  (SBU)  Teny stated that she was surprised by the positive report 
presented by the chairman at the AEC's February 5 plenary session. 
She stated that former Chairman Tom Vraalsen usually presented 
critical reports that raised real issues.  She also stated that the 
SPLM has "more or less" accepted the candidate for the AEC chair, 
former UK Ambassador to Egypt Derek Plumley.  She also stated that 
due to a busy schedule, competing meetings, and new SPLM 
representatives to the AEC, the next scheduled wealth sharing 
working group meeting may have to be postponed. 
 
OIL: ARREARS, TRANSPARENCY, & NPC 
---------------------------------- 
¶5.  (SBU)  Teny said that she realizes that the Government of 
National Unity owes approximately $200 million USD in oil revenue to 
the Government of South Sudan.  Although concerned about this money, 
Teny said that "it is not just a matter of getting back this money, 
it is about the overall way that revenues are transferred."  She 
said that the current method is unpredictable, disorganized, and 
expensive.  She said that it is impossible to calculate when money 
will be received and that this greatly complicates the work 
associated with oil revenues. 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  Teny stated that other senior SPLM leaders are aware of 
problems within the oil industry, but that they have not acted to 
improve it.  She stated that she finds herself torn between 
competing loyalties as both an employee of the Ministry of Energy 
and Mining and an SPLM representative.  She said that senior GoSS 
leaders should unilaterally decide to appoint a number of 
contractors and/or consultants to key positions in the central 
processing facilities, export terminals, and the oil marketing 
department.  Teny believes that these observers would add a new 
level of transparency to the oil industry and increase the capacity 
of southern employees in important positions in this sector.  "I 
have been talking until I am blue in the face about this, but 
nothing has happened," stated Teny. 
 
¶7.  (SBU)  Teny stated that the National Petroleum Commission is not 
yet fully functional and that "guys in the Ministry of Energy and 
Mining control it."  She said that the GoSS has appointed 
representatives to the National Petroleum Commission, but that many 
of them have little experience in the industry and are distracted by 
their other appointments. 
 
¶8.  (U)  Teny said that she hopes that there will be a significant

discovery of oil in the north "as it would take pressure off of the 
south," since the North relies  heavily on the oil revenue from 
fields in the South.  According to Teny, blocks 8, 11, and 14, all 
of which are in the North, show promising signs.  She stated that 
she expects natural gas production to start in the Red Sea in early 
¶2009. 
 
¶9.  (SBU)  COMMENT:  Although Teny is the most senior-ranking SPLM 
member in the Ministry of Energy and Mining, on February 11 she 
appeared frustrated and content to leave the job of reforming her 
ministry to others in her party.   Teny is one of the overworked 
SPLM elite, juggling multiple committee memberships, jobs, and 
loyalties.  Teny's situation seems to be representative of much of 
the SPLM senior leadership.  Having just returned to the GNU, SPLM 
leaders are exhausted by the endless negotiations with the NCP and 
appear tentative in advancing their agenda on important issues such 
as the census, elections, and transparency in the oil industry.
