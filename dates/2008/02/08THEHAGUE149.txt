¶1.  (SBU)  Econoff shared on February 7 ref A points 
requesting information on nuclear-related items actually 
delivered to Iran with Kees Jan Steenhoek, Senior Policy 
Advisor for Foreign Economic Relations and Export Control at 
the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  In a subsequent discussion on February 15, 
Steenhoek said the GONL already publishes approved export 
licenses for military and dual-use goods on the website of 
the Ministry of Economic Affairs, available in Dutch at 
www.exportcontrole.ez.nl.  Information includes item 
description, its reported use and value, destination country, 
and the application and license expiration dates. 
Information on end users is business sensitive and therefore 
not included, Steenhoek added.  Steenhoek offered to provide 
a consolidated list of export licenses specifically approved 
for Iran and discuss with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the 
possibility of providing additional details.  Post will 
follow up and report on any substantive information received. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Steenhoek said IAEA questions on the GONL's one 
export denial (See ref B) should be directed to the Dutch 
mission in Vienna, which has a secure line back to The Hague. 
 Alternatively, questions could be directed to him at 
k.j.steenhoek@minez.nl or to Ceta Noland, Senior Policy 
Officer, Security Policy Directorate, Nuclear and 
Non-Proliferation Division, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at 
cd.vannoland@minbuza.nl.
