SUBJECT: FINNISH RESPONSE - DEMARCHE ON POSSIBLE RUSSIAN 
RECOGNITION OF ABKHAZIA, GEORGIA 
 
REF: SECSTATE 14840 
 
Classified By: POLCHIEF GREG THOME FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
 
(C) PolChief delivered subject demarche Feb. 15 to Antti 
Vanska, Deputy Director of the Finnish MFA Unit for Russia. 
The GoF views Russian unilateral recognition of Abkhazia as 
unlikely.  Some Russian officials had suggested months ago 
that they might consider recognizing Abkhazia, "back when 
they still thought they could derail the Kosovo independence 
process," Vanska said.  Now that the Kosovo process has 
advanced, however, this possibility has diminished.  Russian 
FM Lavrov recently stated publicly that Russia would gain 
nothing by recognizing Abkhazia, Vanska said, adding that the 
GoF has heard suggestions along similar lines from Russian 
officials in private.
