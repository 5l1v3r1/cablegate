SUBJECT: CUBAN TRANSITION IN THE SURINAMESE MEDIA: WELCOME BALANCE 
AND CUSTOMARY INDIFFERENCE 
 
REF: Paramaribo 74, Paramaribo 81 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  Coverage of the transition of power in Cuba by 
the Surinamese media featured mostly wire stories.  Limited 
commentary was characterized by balance and mild criticism of the 
Cuban regime.  Government of Suriname (GOS) public reflection was 
also balanced, with the exception of praise for Fidel Castro by GOS 
Minister of Health Celsius Waterberg.  Criticism of undemocratic 
practices in Cuba was a welcome departure from customary Surinamese 
reticence on controversial issues.  END SUMMARY.

Media Coverage: Balance and Indifference 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U)  Coverage of the transition of power in Cuba in Surinamese 
newspapers was largely made up of wire stories taken either from the 
Associated Press or Dutch sources.  Limited editorial reaction to 
Castro's resignation was typified by the quote, "what does that have 
to do with Suriname?  At first glance, nothing..." courtesy of the 
"Times of Suriname," an opposition-oriented daily.  This February 20 
editorial went on to say Castro's resignation would be a good 
example for Suriname's aging leaders to follow, and featured a 
cartoon showing Castro resigning while Suriname's prominent 
politicians sat at the table drooling, snoring, and sucking their 
thumbs.  Other commentary was more critical and outward-looking. 
"Dagblad Suriname," a second opposition-oriented daily, opined on 
February 22 that "[Castro's] promises of good leadership for the 
most part remained promises..." damaged by, for example, "eager use 
of bullets against Batista supporters."  The editorial did praise 
the education and health systems in Cuba, but concluded it is now 
time for Raul Castro to take advantage of the opportunity reform the 
Cuban economy.  The editorial repeated, without comment, remarks by 
President Bush calling for democracy in Cuba.  A popular television 
talk show discussed the opening of a new Democracy Center in 
Suriname; when asked whether Cuba could be considered a type of 
democracy, one guest, a prominent local academic specializing in 
democracy, said no.  The second guest, Jenny Simons, a prominent 
opposition parliamentarian from the nationalist, left-oriented 
National Democratic Party of Suriname, said the system currently in 
Cuba is not wanted here.

Government Reaction: Balance and Praise 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (U)  On February 25 the consensus paper-of-record, "De Ware 
Tijd," carried commentary on Cuba by major figures from the GOS. 
Speaking prior to the selection of Raul Castro, GOS Vice President 
Ramdien Sardjoe said "we are all curious, but with the intention 
that we get a leadership there which responds to the aspirations of 
the Cuban people."  Minister of Health Celsius Waterberg had praise 
for Castro, calling him a "world leader of stature."  Commenting on 
Castro's health, Waterberg said "we find it only too bad... I think 
people will always be able to fall back on him for council." 
Waterberg was educated in Cuba and has a Cuban wife.

Comment

¶4.  (SBU)  Despite Cuba's prominence in the region, Surinamese 
reticence and overall indifference to political events in Cuba 
should not be surprising; Surinamese are typically inward focused, 
and loathe to get involved in controversy.  For this reason, the 
mild criticism implied by Vice President Sardjoe's remarks, the 
direct criticism from a leftist opposition politician, and a 
balanced account including direct criticism in one of Suriname's 
opposition-oriented newspapers are bigger surprises.  These are also 
good signs that Surinamers - as a rule practical and cynical - are 
less convinced by local Cuban propaganda than the steady stream of 
Cuban-Embassy-engineered press releases would like to suggest.  END
