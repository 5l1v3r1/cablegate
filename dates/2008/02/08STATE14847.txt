SUBJECT: SPECIAL TRIBUNAL FOR LEBANON: NOTIFYING UN ABOUT 
ADDITIONAL U.S. CONTRIBUTION 
 
 
¶1.  (U)  This is an action request.  Department requests post 
provide written notification to the UN that the U.S. intends 
to donate an additional $9 million to the Special Tribunal 
for Lebanon.  USUN should deliver the notification no later 
than noon on February 13.  See para 2 for a draft response. 
 
¶2.  (U)  USUN should draw from the language below: 
 
The United States is pleased to inform you of our intent to 
provide an additional contribution in the form of a grant for 
the Special Tribunal for Lebanon subject to necessary 
Congressional notification.  This letter reiterates Secretary 
Rice's pledge for a $2 million contribution to the Special 
Tribunal for Lebanon plus an additional $7 million to be used 
for startup costs and the first year of operation.  This 
brings the combined U.S. contribution to $14 million for the 
first year and start up costs.
