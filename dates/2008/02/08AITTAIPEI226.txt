REF: 07 STATE 166402 
 
¶1.  Per ref A, Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) 
issued a formal instruction on February 2, 2008, providing all 
banking institutions with information on seven individuals 
(including Fawzi Mutlaq Al-Rawi) with ties to the Iraqi insurgency 
and the former Iraqi regime. 
 
¶2.  The FSC asked banking institutions in Taiwan to strengthen 
monitoring over transactions with the designated individuals which 
will arise because the U.S. has prohibited the U.S. banking sector 
from engaging in transactions with these individuals.  The FSC 
required them to treat transactions with the designated individuals 
and their beneficiaries as suspected money laundering transactions, 
and instantly report these transactions to the Ministry of Justice 
Investigation Bureau for further investigation and action. 
 
¶3.  The FSC also asked the following industry associations to 
request their members to comply with the February 12, 2008 
instructions: 
--Credit Cooperation Association 
--Bills Finance Association 
--Securities Firms Association 
--Securities Investment Trust and Consultant Association 
--Futures Commissioners Association 
--Life Insurance Association 
--Non-life Insurance Association 
--all jewelry associations 
--Credit Card Firms Association
