Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. Key points at the February 27 Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) press 
briefings were: 
 
-- Espionage charges involving a TAO official are being dealt with 
"according to the law." 
 
-- The spokesperson denied that China targets websites in Taiwan or 
elsewhere for blockage. 
 
-- Taiwan authorities' charges that the Mainland was setting 
political obstacles to Mainland tourism of Taiwan were a "distortion 
of the facts," with Chen Shui-bian and his "stubborn adherence to 
Taiwan independence" to blame for the delay in opening up Taiwan for 
Mainland tourism. 
 
-- The [Taiwan] Mainland Affairs Council's recent press release 
regarding the so-called "2005 Consensus" is a "complete 
fabrication." 
 
-- The spokesperson had no information about a possible merger 
between the Taiwan Affairs Office and the Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office. 
 
Espionage Charges against TAO Official 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. At the February 27 regular Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) press 
briefing, TAO spokesman Fan Liqing responded to a question regarding 
the recently reported arrest of a TAO official on espionage charges 
by saying that "the relevant bureaus will deal with the situation in 
accordance with the law." 
 
March 22 Taiwan Election 
------------------------ 
 
¶3. In response to a question about a "direct flight timetable" 
proposed during the recent presidential election debates in Taiwan, 
the spokesperson merely responded that China had "seen reports" of 
the proposal.  Asked about the DPP's supposed recent "softening" 
toward the Mainland in the run-up to the March 22 election, Fan said 
Taiwan should "get rid of obstacles" between the two sides, adhere 
to the one-China principle and recognize the 1992 consensus.  When a 
Xinhua reporter asked for comment about Taiwan authorities' charges 
that the Mainland was setting political obstacles to mainland 
tourism of Taiwan, Fan responded that the charges were a "distortion 
of the facts."  Fan blamed Chen Shui-bian and his "stubborn 
adherence to Taiwan independence" for the delay in opening up Taiwan 
for Mainland tourism. 
 
Mainland Website Censorship 
--------------------------- 
 
¶4. When asked whether China would unblock Taiwan media websites 
before the Olympics, Fan said that China does not target the 
websites of specific areas or "create special policies for 
individual websites." 
 
"2005 Consensus" 
---------------- 
 
¶5. The spokesperson called the [Taiwan] Mainland Affairs Council's 
recent press release regarding the so-called "2005 Consensus" a 
"complete fabrication" and a "slander against the Mainland."  (Note: 
 The MAC press release reportedly stated that, according to what MAC 
calls the "2005 Consensus," both sides in 2005 had agreed to look 
past differences regarding the "one-China principle" and resume 
negotiations on tourism and charter flights.  End note.)  Fan also 
chastised Chen Shui-bian for ignoring the 1992 Consensus. 
 
Cross-Strait Agricultural Entrepreneurial Zones 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶6. Spokesperson Fan announced that Fujian, Guangdong, Hubei and 
Jiangsu would create their own agricultural zones for 
entrepreneurial farmers in order to increase cross-Strait 
agricultural cooperation and encourage investment from Taiwan. 
 
Physician Credentials for Taiwan Citizens 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. Deputy Director of the General Office of the Ministry of Health 
Mao Qunan announced a new program for Taiwan physicians to practice 
in the Mainland.  Physicians must have more than five years of legal 
medical practice in Taiwan, hold a physician's license and currently 
be practicing in Taiwan.  Mao welcomed Taiwan physicians to come to 
the Mainland and noted that the policy was the same for Hong Kong 
and Macao.

-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶8. Hong Kong, Macao Affairs Office Commissioner of Education Liu 
Jianfeng announced a number of adjustments to the policies governing 
citizens of Taiwan who attend school on the Mainland.  Liu said that 
the policies are designed to ensure that children who are Taiwan 
citizens are not discriminated against in the Mainland school 
system. 
 
Agency Reorganization, Tzu Chi Foundation, Trade Policy 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
¶9. Fan said that she had no information about a possible merger 
between the Taiwan Affairs Office and the Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office.  Fan also confirmed that the PRC has approved an 
application by Taiwan's Tzu Chi Foundation, a Buddhist-founded 
nonprofit, to operate in the Mainland.  Finally, Deputy Director of 
the MOFCOM Electrical and Mechanical Technology Industries Zhou 
Ruojun discussed future trade policy adjustments aimed at promoting 
cross-Strait trade growth and ensuring sustainable use of resources.
