¶1.   (C)  Summary:   In the wake of the losses suffered by  Musharraf's Pakistan Muslim League (PML) and the religious  parties, scenarios for the next government are being debated. 
 Bhutto widower Zardari described the Pakistan People's Party  (PPP) as supporting a government of ""national unity,"" but he  is leaning toward a coalition with Nawaz Sharif which  excludes the leadership of the pro-government PML.  Musharraf's advisors have tried to convince Zardari to  exclude Nawaz Sharif in any PPP-led government, but Zardari  argues he does not need a party that was resoundingly  defeated and whose winners are (allegedly) defecting in  droves.  Zardari argues that a government without Nawaz would  be weak, short-lived, and ultimately damage the PPP.  Zardari  claims he does not intend to force a confrontation with  Musharraf nor allow Nawaz to do so. 
 
¶2.  (C)  Zardari fears the GOP (""the agencies"") will attempt  to split the PPP by backing Amin Faheem, who Zardari does not  want to become Prime Minister.  Zardari floated the idea of  allowing Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) stalwart  Javed  Hashmi - whom he claims is on the outs with Nawaz - or the  head of the Pashtun nationalist Awami National Party (ANP),  Asfandyar Wali Khan to become Prime Minister.  Ambassador  emphasized the need to look toward the future, not to revisit  old issues, and stressed our concerns about Nawaz's seeming  desire to focus the new assembly on getting rid of President  Musharraf instead of on the insurgency and the economy. 
Zardari candidly said he knew he had to deal with Musharraf  because of Musharraf's influence with the military and his  own lack of credibility with that institution.  End summary. 
 
 
¶3.  (C)  Ambassador met alone with Bhutto widower and party  head Asif Zardari February 20 for ninety minutes to discuss  his plans for the PPP's participation in government.  Not  surprisingly, Zardari sought to send the right messages to  the USG about fighting terrorism,  PPP's long alliance with  the U.S., and the need for a long-term strategy in the tribal  areas.  As had NSA Tariq Aziz, he noted that Nawaz had  benefited from a last-minute infusion of Saudi money and  support, ostensibly taking votes away from the PPP (Ref A). 
 
¶4.  (C)  Zardari had met February 19 with NSA Tariq Aziz and  DG ISI General Nadeem Taj about the formation of the  government.   Zardari said he wanted  a ""government of  national unity"" with Nawaz Sharif, ANP, independents, and  probably the Muttahida Quami Movement (MQM) party. 
Ambassador asked about Nawaz  Sharif's desire to unseat  Musharraf.   Ambassador said the Embassy had good relations  with Nawaz and his party, but we were concerned by recent  public statements in which he seemed to look toward the past. 
 This strategy would not solve Pakistan's critical economic  challenges and the insurgency. 
 
¶5.  (C)  Zardari said he would not accept Sharif's public  conditions.  If Nawaz joined the PPP coalition, Zardari  planned to meet Nawaz's demands on the judiciary by burying  them in committee, which he thought might satisfy Nawaz.  He  said that if the PPP left Nawaz out of its coalition, the  government would be weak, would fail quickly, and Nawaz would  win the next election.   Zardari said it was even possible  they could agree to give the PML-N the Prime Minister  position, but neither Nawaz nor his brother Shahbaz will be  in the parliament.  One possible candidate, he mused, was  PML-Q stalwart,  Javed Hashmi.   According to Zardari, Nawaz  had assigned Hashmi to the closest races in hopes that he  would lose.  ""What is Nawaz going to tell me,"" Zardari  laughed, ""that he doesn't want Javed Hashmi to be Prime  Minister?"" (Ref B) 
 
¶6.  (C)  Another option, Zardari mused, was to give the PM  post to the ANP leader, Asfandyar Wali Khan, who could be a  compromise candidate.   Zardari said he was afraid the  ""government forces"" (ISI, etc) would try and split the PPP  and make Amin Faheem Prime Minister.  Zardari noted  Faheem  has never done a day's work in his life,"" and that ""he had  been in Dubai five times since Benazir's death for rest and 
  ISLAMABAD 00000745  002 OF 002 
 
  recreation."" Benazir was fond of him and he was loyal,  Zardari recounted, but Faheem was incompetent.   Zardari  described Faheem as ""not happy"" with the Prime Minister post  slipping away from him.   As reported reftel, Zardari said he  would be more inclined toward PPP Punjab leader, Shah Mehmood  Qureshi. 
 
¶7.  (C)  Ambassador asked Zardari about rumors that he  planned to put his sister Azra Pechuho - a respected  physician with a reserved seat from Sindh - into the Prime  Ministership until he could take the job himself.   Zardari  replied Benazir had come up with this scheme at one point,  but he knew it was not viable. 
 
¶8.  (C)  Zardari said he was trying to convince Musharraf's  advisors that Nawaz would be better off ""inside the tent""  than outside.  He said that he would not work with PML leader  Pervaiz Elahi.  ""Why,"" he asked  ""should I include someone  who has just had an embarrassing defeat at the polls when I  can attract many of his assembly members to my side.  They  are already calling us.""   Zardari added that he would have a  hard time bringing along his party stalwarts if the PML were  in the coalition.  Zardari said he was trying to convince  Musharraf he would work with him.  He knew the Army would  never see Musharraf humiliated, that Musharraf still had  power within the Army, and he recognized his own reputation  within the Army was not good. 
 
¶9.  (C)  Comment:  Zardari is far less emotional than his  late wife.  He seems both ruthless and practical but his  political skills have not really been put to the test.   The  process of forming a government will go through several,  emotion-laden versions over the next few days.
