SUBJECT: AFGHANISTAN: POST ASSESSMENT ON THE RELEASE OF NIGHT VISION 
DEVICES 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request - see paragraph 2. 
 
¶2. (SBU) SUMMARY:  Post requests the immediate release of Night 
Vision Devices (NVDs), specifically 1,750 pairs of the American 
Technologies Network Corporation ATN NVG7-CGTI Individual Night 
Vision Device-Night Vision Goggles, to the Government of the Islamic 
Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA).  The Generation 2 system will be 
used by the Afghan National Army (ANA) Commando Battalions to 
advance nighttime operational effectiveness while reducing 
collateral damage risk.  Two commando battalions are teamed with 
Coalition Forces in combat operations at this time, with additional 
units in training.  USG funding for this equipment is estimated at 
$2.3M through a Title 22 funded Foreign Military Sales case.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
Justification of NVD Technology for Release 
 
¶3. (SBU) ATN NVG7-CGTI Individual NVDs will provide high quality 
image clarity for nighttime operations.  They allow the wearer to 
select and clearly identify the enemy and reduce the possibility of 
collateral damage. 
 
Justification of GIRoA Need and U.S. Interests 
 
¶4. (SBU) The ANA Commando Battalions need a viable night vision 
capability that will allow them to safely and effectively support 
ANA and Coalition Force night operations - particularly in 
conjunction with Coalition Special Operations Forces.  Release of 
the NVDs will enhance the ANA Commandos' ability to conduct 
counter-terrorism missions, improve interoperability with Coalition 
Forces, and improve their ability to maintain their own defense and 
security. 
 
Afghanistan Safeguarding Sensitive Technology 
 
¶5. (SBU) Afghanistan has demonstrated the intent and ability to 
protect sensitive, classified military technology since working with 
U.S. and Coalition Forces.  The Embassy has confirmed with the 
Afghan government, in writing, their intent to provide these items 
with the same degree of security as the U.S. would provide.  We will 
continue to mentor the GIRoA on their protection of sensitive USG 
technology in anticipation of long-term cooperation between our 
governments.  We also will obtain all necessary formal agreements 
with the GIRoA before transferring any sensitive equipment or 
technology. 
 
Anticipated Reaction from Neighboring Nations 
 
¶6. (SBU) We do not anticipate the release of these NVDs to the GIRoA 
will adversely affect the regional balance of power or cause 
negative reactions from neighboring nations. 
 
Afghanistan's Political Importance to the Region 
 
¶7. (SBU) A stable, democratically-elected Afghan government, capable 
of protecting its people and sovereignty, and remaining at peace 
with its neighbors is one of the USG's highest priorities.  The 
release and employment of ATN NVG7-CGTI NVDs will facilitate 
progress toward this goal, advancing the ANA Commando Battalions' 
ability to identify, target and carry out night operations against 
anti-Afghan, anti-ISAF, and anti-OEF forces while reducing the risk 
to self and others. 
 
Source of Financing and Economic Impact 
 
¶8. (SBU) This purchase will be financed by the USG using Foreign 
Military Sales Funding.  The cost is estimated at $2.3 million for 
1,750 pairs of goggles.  There is no significant economic impact 
anticipated to be generated by this sale. 
 
Relevant Human Rights Considerations 
 
¶9. (SBU) There are no human rights considerations that should 
preclude the release of the defense equipment to the GIRoA. 
 
Training 
 
¶10. (SBU) Training would be provided by U.S. personnel already in 
country and not necessitate additional U.S. presence. 
 
Post Recommendation 
 
¶11. (SBU) Post recommends immediate Washington approval for the 
release of the ATN NVG7-CGTI NVDs to the GIRoA.
