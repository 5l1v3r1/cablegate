REF: 07 Moscow 5408 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Prime Minister Zubkhov officially appointed Sergey 
Kiriyenko Director General of the newly formed Rosatom State 
Corporation on February 4.  Natasha Klishina, head of the Bilateral 
Cooperation Section of Rosatom's International Department, reviewed 
with us February 5 the state of play in the transition from the old 
to the new Rosatom. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Rosatom will soon announce the formal "liquidation" of the 
old structure, Klishina told us.  The transition will take about 8-9 
months.  Rosatom officials tell us the next two or three months may 
be the most intensive.  Rosatom will send employees a two-month 
"notice letter."  The Corporation will offer many employees, but not 
all, positions in the new structure.  Klishina anticipated that all 
current Rosatom Deputy Directors would carry on into the new 
Corporation. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Klishina observed that the transition was taking place 
largely as envisioned last fall when the Duma passed the Rosatom 
Corporation law (ref).  Consolidation of the various civil 
components of Rosatom under Atomenergoprom (AEP) was proceeding. 
Klishina felt the new structure would serve, as intended, to improve 
integration and competitiveness.  Although the state budget will 
fund Rosatom Corporation in the early years, Klishina affirmed that 
the goal is for the Atomenergoprom to turn a profit and become 
self-sustaining in the medium term.  Ultimately, government funding 
would support only the research and development functions of Rosatom 
Corporation. 
 
¶4.  (U) The GOR released February 7 a preliminary organizational 
chart of Rosatom Corporation.  The chart shows four functional 
groups: the nuclear weapons complex (composed of 15 enterprises); 
nuclear and radiation safety, to include the handling of spent 
nuclear fuel (7 enterprises); scientific, research and training 
institutions (18 enterprises); and AEP.  Under AEP fall 86 
institutions and organizations related to the civilian nuclear power 
industry. 
 
¶5.  (U)  President Putin named the Rosatom Corporation Supervisory 
Board in late 2007.  The Board consists of the following members: 
 
¶S. V. Kiriyenko (Director General of the Corporation) 
¶S. S. Sobyanin (Head of the Presidential Administration) 
¶S. E. Prikhodko (Assistant to the President) 
¶I. I. Shuvalov (Assistant to the President) 
¶L. I. Brichiova (Assistant to the President) 
¶A. R. Belousov (Deputy Minster for Economic Development and 
          Trade) 
¶I. V. Borovkov (Deputy Chief of Staff of the Government and 
       Head of the Military-Industrial Commission 
       of the GOR) 
¶A. V. Bortnikov (Head of the Economic Security Service, 
        FSB) 
¶V. N. Verhovtsev (Head of Department 12 of the Ministry of 
        Defense (Nuclear Weapons))
