¶1.  The President of the governing Council of the International 
Civil Aviation Organization(ICAO), Roberto Kobeh, sent a reply to 
the FAA Administrator, copied to USICAO, affirming ICAO's acceptance 
of the September 10, 2007 United States' offer to continue worldwide 
access to the U.S. Global Positioning System-GPS.  Text of ICAO's 
acceptance, which repeats the U.S. offer, is given paragraph two. 
The exchange of letters renews the pre-existing agreement regarding 
GPS services between the United States Government and ICAO.  A PDF 
copy of the letter has been emailed to OES/SAT RClore, IO/T LLuftig, 
EB/TRA/OTP WDayton, L/EB K Milton, and L/OES M Simonoff, FAA/API 
JTooren, FAA BCleese, and DOT/OST J Kiser. 
 
¶2.  The text of President Kobeh's December 18, 2007 letter is 
below. 
 
Begin text: 
 
Sir/Madam, 
 
I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of the letter dated 
September 10, 2007 from Mrs. Marion C. Blakey, Administrator, 
Federal Aviation Administration, which reads as follows: 
 
(Begin quote of US offer) This letter reaffirms the United States 
Government's commitment to provide the Global Positioning System-GPS 
Standard Positioning Service-SPS for aviation throughout the world. 
Further, the United States commits to provide the Wide-Area 
Augmentation System (WAAS) service within its prescribed service 
volume. 
 
More than ten years ago, the United States began providing the GPS 
SPS.  Since 1994, GPS has grown into a global utility whose 
multi-use services have become essential elements of the worldwide 
infrastructure.  In 2003, the United States commissioned the WAAS 
Satellite-Based Augmentation System to provide improved space-based 
positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) service.  In 2004, the U.S. 
Government's GPS management structure was improved by national 
policy directive to accommodate a more comprehensive approach to 
planning, resource allocation, and system development.  This policy 
strengthens civil participation in managing GPS and supports state 
aircraft access to airspace using other using other GPS signals, 
such as Precise Positioning Service (PPS) where the capability is 
equivalent. 
 
The U.S. Government maintains its commitment to provide GPS SPS 
signals on a continuous worldwide basis, free of direct user fees, 
enabling worldwide civil space-based PNT services (to include GPS 
SPS augmentation), and to provide open, free access to information 
necessary to develop and build equipment to use these services. 
 
The U.S. Government commits to providing single frequency WAAS 
signals on a nondiscriminatory basis, free of direct user fees, 
throughout the area of coverage of WAAS satellites within its 
prescribed service volume and to provide open free access to 
information necessary to develop and build equipment to use these 
services.  WAAS provides new and improved aviation capabilities for 
satellite-based vertical-guidance procedures, consistent 
International Civil Aviation Organization initiatives.   The U.S. 
Government has concluded arrangements with Canada and Mexico that 
extend the WAAS service in North America and is supporting testing 
and development of WAAS capabilities for the Western  Hemisphere. 
 
The U.S. Government plans to take all necessary measures for the 
foreseeable future to maintain the integrity, reliability, and 
availability of the GPS SPS and WAAS service and expects to provide 
at least six years' notice prior to any termination of such 
operations or elimination of such services. 
 
All of the above commitments are subject to the availability of 
funds as required by United States law. 
 
The availability of GPS and WAAS signals is not intended in any way 
to limit the right of any State to control the operations of 
aircraft and enforce safety regulations within its sovereign 
airspace.  Furthermore, the United States expects that standards and 
recommended practices (SARPS) developed by the ICAO will continue to 
be compatible with GPS operations and vice versa, and that States 
will be free to augment GPS in accordance with appropriate SARPS. 
 
I (FAA-Blakey)would greatly appreciate your confirmation that the 
ICAO is satisfied with the foregoing political commitments, which I 
submit in lieu of an agreement.  In that event, this letter and your 
reply will comprise the continued mutual understanding between the 
Government of the United States and the ICAO regarding the provision 
and use of space-based navigation services." (End quote of U.S. 
offer) 
 
I (ICAO Pres. Kobeh) am pleased to inform you that the arrangements 
contained in the foregoing are acceptable to the International Civil 
Aviation Organization. 
Complimentary close and signed by Roberto Kobeh Gonzalez. (End text 
of ICAO acceptance)
