In Today's Papers 
 
High Court Chief: The Regime Is Not in Danger 
All papers report High Court of Appeals Chairman Hasan Gerceker said 
at a meeting with the press Wednesday he does not think Turkey's 
secular system is at risk.  Gerceker added any discussion to the 
contrary was "not timely."  Gerceker also said the judiciary would 
implement any changes "the political will" would want in article 301 
of the Turkish penal code, which makes "insulting Turkishness" a 
crime.  "However, I don't think article 301 restricts free speech," 
noted Gerceker.  Mainstream papers comment that Gerceker, unlike 
other high court members who have issued warnings on these matters 
in the past, refrained from commenting on "secularism" or "threats 
to the regime." 
 
Gates, Cheney to Visit Turkey 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Zaman and others 
report Defense Secretary Robert Gates will pay an official visit to 
Turkey on February 27-28.  Papers report Gates will meet with his 
Turkish counterpart Vecdi Gonul as well as the President, PM, and 
the chief of military general staff  in order to discuss the fight 
against terror, Iraq, Iran, and Cyprus.  Liberal Radikal and 
mainstream Sabah claim Gates will ask Turkey to give "active 
military support" to the fight against terror in Afghanistan. 
 
Papers also report US Vice-President Dick Cheney is expected to 
visit Turkey in March.  Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet expects 
Cheney to ask Turkey to contribute an additional 2,000 troops to the 
peacekeeping force in Afghanistan.  Radikal reminds Turkey had 
earlier turned down troop demands for the high-risk zone in 
Afghanistan.  The paper comments whether the US-Turkey cooperation 
in combating the PKK would lead to a change in Turkey's position in 
Afghanistan. 
 
Turkey- US Summit on Terrorist Extradition 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Taraf, Zaman and others 
report Justice Minister Mehmet Ali Sahin said Turkey was planning to 
hold a symposium in March in Istanbul to discuss extradition of 
terror suspects.  Mainstream Milliyet reports that during his visit 
to Turkey last week, US Attorney General Michael Mukasey offered to 
arrange a round-table meeting of Turkish and US specialists to 
discuss extradition issues.  Sahin reportedly told Mukasey there 
were no problems in extradition of criminals between Turkey and the 
US, but added that EU countries used to decline Turkish extradition 
requests.  Sahin, therefore, offered to invite EU countries such as 
Belgium and France which Turkey experiences problems regarding the 
extradition of terrorists. 
 
AKP Carries the Constitutional Draft to the US 
Mainstream Milliyet reports that AKP Vice Chairman Dengir Mir Firat, 
Constitutional Amendment Committee chairman Prof. Ergun Ozbudun and 
AKP Mardin deputy Cuneyt Yuksel will go to the US to attend a 
conference at Colombia University on March 3 to discuss the new 
constitution draft.  Reportedly, one of the sponsors of the 
conference is Turkish Cultural Center which is known to be close to 
Fethullah Gulen. 
 
Parliament Adopts New Foundations Law 
Sabah, Turkiye, Milliyet, Hurriyet, Radikal, Yeni Safak and others: 
The Turkish Parliament adopted the new foundations law yesterday. 
The opposition parties MHP and CHP voted against it, but 
nevertheless, the law was passed by 242 votes in favor and 72 
against.  The new law allows foreigners to establish new foundations 
in Turkey on the principle of legal and actual reciprocity. 
Conservative-nationalist Turkiye notes that foundations will also be 
able to establish economic enterprises and companies on the 
condition they notify Turkey's foundation authority.  Foundations 
will be able to acquire assets and use them at their will. 
 
PM Erdogan Urges Turkish Ambassadors to Stay Committed in EU Bid 
 
ANKARA 00000328  002 OF 003 
 
 
Radikal, Yeni Safak, Sabah, Hurriyet, Milliyet and others:  Prime 
Minister Erdogan hosted a luncheon for a group of Turkish 
Ambassadors who were recently appointed to their new missions 
abroad.  PM Erdogan voiced strong commitment for Turkey's EU 
accession and urged the ambassadors to fight against efforts aiming 
to divert Turkey's efforts to join the EU.  Islamist-oriented Yeni 
Safak describes the PM's words as a call for mobilization in the EU 
accession process. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Pakistan, Armenia 
 
"Pakistan's Democracy Test" 
Sami Kohen wrote in mainstream Milliyet:  "The most important aspect 
of the Pakistani elections is that they took place in a free and 
orderly fashion.  Thus, Pakistan has gained significant ground 
regarding democracy. The election results are a clear indication of 
the people's demand for democracy and change.  This opens a new page 
in Pakistan's political history.  This is going to be a challenging 
period of transition in Pakistan.  Under normal conditions, a 
president and an opposition-led government can work in harmony.  But 
Pakistan does not have that type of political and democratic 
maturity yet.  Given the challenges that Pakistan is going through, 
all of the political powers are required to work toward consensus 
versus polarization.  In the coming days, Pakistan will show the 
extent to which it is ready to digest the essence of democracy." 
 
"Conditions Will Force Sarkisian Toward Pragmatism" 
Semih Idiz wrote in mainstream Milliyet:  "What are the possible 
outcomes of the Sarkisian era?  Given the grave economic challenges 
that Armenia is facing, the country's priority must be the economy 
and not the genocide issue. Sarkisian also is aware of the fact that 
the continuation of Karabakh issue harms more Armenians than 
Azerbaijanis.  Indeed this issue, rather than genocide issue, is the 
main reason for Turkey's political and economic embargo against 
Armenia.  Sarkisian will have to take some pragmatic steps regarding 
Karabakh, if only for the sake of the Armenian economy.  Speaking 
with Armenian officials here in Yerevan, it is obvious that they are 
waiting for Turkey take the first step toward dialogue.  Once this 
happens, it is expected that the Diaspora will also soften its 
attitude toward Ankara.  Turkey, on the other hand, does not want to 
harm its relations with Azerbaijan and does not want to appear to 
take initiative while Armenia remains on Azeri territories.  In 
other words, Ankara expects Armenia to take the first step towards 
dialogue.  One thing is for certain: given the current 
circumstances, Sarkisian will have to be more pragmatic now than 
ever before."
