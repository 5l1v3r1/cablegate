Panama Ponders Whether to Accept 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶1. (C) "Let me raise this request with (First VP and FM) 
Samuel Lewis," Lewis' Senior Advisor Adolfo Ahumada told 
POLCOUNS on February 8 in response to reftel request for GOP 
assistance.  Ahumada underscored (twice) in a brief 
conversation the "political sensitivities" that would need to 
be overcome to accept any protected Cuban migrant from U.S. 
Naval Station, Guantanamo.  Given the narrow and specific 
nature of this request -- to commit to facilitate the entry 
and treatment of one protected migrant in the event of 
medical necessity with the understanding that the USG would 
pay for all transportation and medical treatment costs as 
well as, upon termination of medical treatment, return the 
migrant to Guantanamo -- Ahumada undertook to consult with 
Lewis.

Comment

¶2.  (C)  While Ahumada, Lewis' closest advisor and confidant, 
was willing bring this special case to Lewis' attention, it 
is important not to raise expectations too high that Panama 
will commitment to facilitate medical treatment.  Panama is 
normally loathe to accept migrants, particularly Cuban 
migrants and especially Cuban migrants from Guantanamo. 
Should Panama agree to assist in this case, Panama is likely 
to underscore that it is not establishing any precedents for 
future migrant cases and to insist that this matter be 
handled without any public fanfare.  In the end, post 
assesses that Panama is very, very unlikely to commit to 
offer assistance in this matter.  Post will continue to 
follow up on this matter until a final decision is reached.
