     Â¶B. SOMERS-ROACH E-MAIL OF 02/28/08 
 
(SBU) As per ref B, A/DCM presented ref A information to MFA 
Acting Director General for International Organizations 
Affairs Mr. Saleumxay Kommasith.  DG Saleumxay did not 
provide a substantive response.  Laos, of course, is not on 
the Security Council, is land-locked, and perceives no direct 
interest in the issue even though piracy is recognized within 
ASEAN as a common security threat.
