Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Robert J. Faucher for reasons 
1.4 (B) and (D). 
 
¶1.  (C) Irish Prime Minister (Taoiseach) Bertie Ahern has 
announced that he has accepted an invitation from Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi to address a joint session of Congress on April 
30, 2008.  At the same time, Declan Ganley, the President of 
the Libertas Institute, which is leading the fight in Ireland 
against the Treaty, urged the Ambassador to press Congress 
not to set the date for the Congressional address by Ahern 
prior to the date for the Irish referendum on the Lisbon 
Treaty.  The Ambassador assured Ganley the U.S. would take no 
side in the Treaty debate.  End summary. 
 
AHERN BEFORE CONGRESS 
--------------------- 

¶2.  (U) Stating that he was deeply honored, Irish Prime 
Minister (the Taoiseach) Bertie Ahern announced late on 
February 19 that he has accepted an historic invitation from 
Speaker Nancy Pelosi to address a joint session of Congress 
on April 30, 2008.  It is expected that his 30-minute speech 
will highlight the strong historical relationship between the 
U.S. and Ireland, express gratitude to Members of Congress 
who have supported the Northern Ireland peace process over 
the years, and include reference to Ireland's strong economic 
performances and global issues of mutual concern, such as 
Kosovo, Darfur, and climate change. 
 
¶3.  (C) Ahern, who addressed a joint session of the British 
Parliament last year, will become only the fifth world leader 
ever to have addressed joint sessions of both Congress and 
the British Parliament(Haile Selassie, Charles de Gaulle, 
Francois Mitterrand and Nelson Mandela).  Previous Irish 
leaders who have addressed Congress include John Burton, 
Garret FitzGerald, Liam Cosgrave, Eamon de Valera and Sean T. 
O'Kelly. 
 
LISBON TREATY OPPONENTS DISMAYED 
-------------------------------- 

¶4.  (C) Declan Ganley, the President of the anti-Lisbon Treaty 
'Libertas Institute', accompanied by his Executive Assistant 
Stephen Nolan, met with the Ambassador February 19 to urge 
him to press Congress not to set the date for the address by 
Ahern to both houses of Congress prior to the date for the 
Irish referendum on the Lisbon Treaty.  Ganley expressed 
great concern that Ahern, whose favorable ratings have been 
falling since his June 2007 re-election, would use the 
inevitable bounce in popularity from his appearance before 
Congress to sway Irish voters to support the Treaty. 
 
¶5.  (C) Ganley warned that the U.S. must be careful not to 
directly or indirectly influence the outcome of the Treaty 
referendum in Ireland.  Ganley believed that Ahern's address 
to Congress will undoubtedly touch upon the importance of 
Ireland's approving the Lisbon Treaty.  Ganley went on to 
assert that such a statement in Congress will be seen by 
Irish voters as a U.S. endorsement of Ahern's vision and the 
government's support of the Treaty.  Ganley added that the 
U.S. should be prepared for harsh criticism in leading 
European newspapers. 
 
¶6.  (C) The Ambassador responded that, while the Embassy is 
watching the Treaty referendum with interest, the U.S. will 
take no side in the debate.  He stressed that for most 
Americans there is little interest in or awarneness about the 
referendum.  Ahern's Congressional address will be seen in 
the U.S. primarily as an expression of the long-standing 
excellent bilateral relations between the U.S. and Ireland. 
 
 
¶7.  (C) Comment:  Ganley's Libertas Institution is clearly 
concerned that casting Ahern in a statesmanlike role will 
provide unwanted credibility to Ahern's support of the 
Treaty.  While we can expect a bounce for Ahern, who is 
beleaguered by investigations and tribunals into his personal 
affairs, Ganley is overstating the case that much of Ireland 
will be swayed regarding the Treaty due to Ahern's 
Congressional appearance.  End Comment.
