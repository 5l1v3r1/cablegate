¶1. (SBU)  On February 15, we delivered reftel points regarding U.S. 
support for the IAEA request to the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) 
Governments for additional information regarding export denials to 
Iran or nuclear related items already delivered to Iran. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Alexandr Bolichiov of the MFA Directorate of Disarmament 
and Security Affairs (DVBR) expressed two concerns.  First is the 
potential for information to be leaked when provided to the IAEA or 
the NSG.  He reports that Russia has had a number of incidents in 
which information provided to IAEA or NSG was leaked outside these 
groups.  Second, the GOR normally reports Iran nuclear item 
deliveries through established channels in the UNSC.  There is no 
established mechanism for reporting this type of information to the 
NSG or IAEA.
