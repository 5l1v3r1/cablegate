PROSTITUTION IN AFTERMATH OF 2006 WORLD CUP

¶1.  (SBU) Summary: North-Rhine Westphalia (NRW), Germany's most 
populous state, appears to be successfully combating trafficking 
in persons for the purposes of sexual exploitation.  Using both 
traditional and innovative methods, NRW experienced a decrease 
in the number of trafficking in persons cases in 2006.  The 
State Office of Criminal Investigation (LKA), the Ministry of 
Integration and Women's Affairs (MGFFI) and local NGOs attribute 
this decrease to their multi-organizational approach in 
executing what they describe as a comprehensive strategy to 
reduce trafficking in persons and told us that they have been 
approached not only by other German states, but also neighboring 
countries to share their best practices.  End Summary.

The Numbers Speak for Themselves: NRW TIP Victims Down in 2006 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
¶2.  (U) According to the LKA's annual report on trafficking in 
persons for the purposes of sexual exploitation, the number of 
such cases in NRW decreased by 11 percent from 78 in 2005 to 69 
in 2006, the most recent year for which data are available. 
These figures also show that in 2006 the actual number of forced 
prostitution victims statewide was at its lowest level in almost 
10 years (99 victims).  The majority of the victims (78 percent) 
were from Eastern Europe, with the largest percentages from 
Romania (21.1 percent) and Poland (14.4 percent). 
 
-------------------------------- 
Traditional Strategies Beefed Up 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) A senior official at the Ministry of Integration and 
Women's Affairs told Pol/Econ officer recently that press 
speculation over increased demand for prostitute services, which 
could have increased the number of trafficked forced 
prostitution victims during the 2006 World Cup, "sent the 
ministry into overdrive."  A senior LKA official told us the 
long-standing interagency working group that addresses this 
issue beefed up its traditional three-pronged approach 
(heightened awareness, additional border checks, and increased 
police presence).  Senior MGFFI officials said these strategies 
were particularly effective as they were a result of a 
long-standing working relationship among various stakeholders, 
including the LKA, MGFFI, relevant NGOs, and local police 
throughout the state.  Together, they increased their outreach 
efforts through awareness campaigns which included pamphlets, 
flyers, and additional training for police officers.  They also 
leveraged their resources and used additional border checks 
originally designated to check for soccer hooligans to also 
check for possible TIP victims.  Lastly, the group worked with 
local police to increase the latter's presence in red light 
districts and in other areas where tourists were expected to 
congregate.

¶4.  (SBU) Senior officials at the MGFFI told us they believe NRW 
has played a "leading and pioneering role" in Germany in 
supporting TIP victims, an assessment shared by the Federal 
Family Ministry, which has the lead within the German federal 
government on fighting TIP.  MGFFI funds various NGOs that work 
in this area and noted that there was a mass outcry across party 
lines from state parliamentarians when the administration did 
not request funding for TIP victim services programs in 2007 due 
to an anticipated budget crunch.  Parliamentary members added a 
line item to the budget and overwhelmingly voted to continue 
funding these programs, which receive 1 million euros annually. 
In NRW, eight NGOs are specifically engaged in helping TIP 
victims who have been forced to work in prostitution.

From Traditional to Innovative:  Taking Effective Programs One 
Step Further 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Ministry officials highlighted one work transition 
program, jointly funded by NRW and the European Union's Social 
Fund with 1.1 million euros, calling the administering NGO 
("Madonna")  one of the most "successful and respected" in the 
field.  They highlighted that from mid-2006 until mid-2007, 40 
(of 70) prostitutes were successfully trained to become nurses 
in homes for senior citizens.  MGFFI supports Madonna's work 
with 245,000 euros annually.

¶6.  (SBU) The head of Madonna told us that in 2006, in response 
to press speculation about an increase in forced prostitution 
during the World Cup, the organization teamed up with another 
NGO, Kober, to extend their counseling services to women who 
wanted to get out of the prostitution industry.  While Madonna 
and Kober have traditionally offered intensive counseling 
in-person and via telephone, the launching of the new 
cooperation agreement allows them to pool their resources to 
increase effectiveness, to offer their services in an on-line 
format in seven different languages, and to branch out across 
the state.

Comment 
------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Our conversations with key stakeholders across NRW 
indicate that the media hype surrounding the anticipated 
increase in forced prostitution during the 2006 World Cup -- 
although it turned out to be unfounded -- served as a major 
motivational tool for those in the state who fight this crime on 
a daily basis.  In addition to expanding the scope of existing 
methods, these groups also designed new and innovative 
strategies for combating forced prostitution.  We share the 
confidence of NRW stakeholders that they are on the right track. 
 The state's commitment to funding anti-TIP initiatives is 
another indication that there is strong political will to fight 
human trafficking.
