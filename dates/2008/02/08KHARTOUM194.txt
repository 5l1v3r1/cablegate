¶1. (SBU) On February 7, Embassy Khartoum received a letter from the 
Chadian Embassy claiming that the Sudanese government had dispatched 
forty-eight armed vehicles carrying Chadian rebels and members of 
the Sudanese Armed Forces across the border into Chad.  The convoy 
is said to have left at five in the morning February 6. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Translation of the letter follows. 
 
Begin text: 
 
Further to our press release of January 16, citing that the rebels 
are well-trained and prepared by the Government of Sudan to take 
subversive action against Chad and to derail the deployment of the 
hybrid forces in Darfur and the European forces in Chad and the 
CAR. 
 
We said in this release that an attack against Chad is imminent, and 
just six hours after the release Chad was attacked by the enemy, 
made up of rebels and militias funded and trained by Sudan. 
 
We inform again the national and international opinion that Sudan 
continues to provide logistical support to Chadian rebels, and 
recently raised a strong arm against Adre. 
 
On February 2, 2008 the Sudanese government sent another convoy of 
some forty armed Toyotas and five trucks carrying ammunitions and 
shells from the Sudanese town of El Geneina into Chad, headed by 
Tahir Guinassou, Abakar Tollimi and other Sudanese militia to 
provide relief to rebels who had left N'Djamena headed toward 
Sudan. 
 
The same day, a convoy of rebels and Sudanese militia supported by 
Sudanese air power attacked the village of Adre, which the Chadian 
Army protested. We received information on the morning of February 4 
that the Sudanese government had provided Chadian rebels and 
janjaweed with 200 new Toyotas which are currently being armed so 
that rebels can attack other villages in Chad, particularly the 
village of Adre. 
 
On Feburary 6, 2008 the Sudanese government sent another convoy of 
forty-eight armed Toyotas carrying Chadian rebels and Sudanese Armed 
Forces, which crossed the border at five in the morning. 
 
Today, Sudan in a change of strategy is sending weapons, ammunition 
and fuel to the border (Hadjar-Hadid, Tourab-Ahamar) while the 
rebels and militias continue to seek the destabilization of Chad. 
 
The Sudanese government has not ceased in its aggressive actions 
against Chad, using multiple tactics to create rebel militias from 
many factions to start a civil war in Chad meant to cover its own 
problems in Darfur. That is the reality of the hour.
