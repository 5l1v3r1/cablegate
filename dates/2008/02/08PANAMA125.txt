"Panama will continue to support efforts to address the 
situation in Lebanon in the Security Council," Acting FM 
Ricardo "Dicky" Duran told POLCOUNS on February 11 in 
response to reftel demarche.  (Note:  Due to Panama's 
Carnival celebrations, post was unable to deliver this 
demarche to an appropriate senior GOP official prior to 
Department's February 7 deadline.)   Duran undertook to 
consult with First VP and FM Samuel Lewis to consider issuing 
a public declaration condemning Syrian and Iranian 
interference in Lebanon.  On other proposals, Duran 
summarized that:  (1) economic assistance was unlikely to be 
forthcoming, (2) military assistance was impossible given 
that Panama does not have a military, (3) no high-level 
visits by GOP officials to Damascus were expected, and (4) 
Panama would continue to fulfill its UN obligations to impose 
financial and other sanctions against entities that sought to 
undermine Lebanon.  (Comment:  Panama is unlikely to do 
anything unilateral to support Lebanese PM Siniora's 
government or to increase pressure against Syria and its 
proxies in Lebanon.  That said, Panama will continue to be 
supportive of U.S. positions in the UNSC.)
