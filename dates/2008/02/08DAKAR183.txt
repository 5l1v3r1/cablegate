¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  After four years of missteps and missed 
opportunities, Senegal is again pursuing a Millennium Challenge 
Corporation (MCC) compact, with some positive initial efforts. 
Responding to MCC criteria for re-engagement, Senegal has 
established a new counterpart agency and has agreed to work together 
on examining the country's economic constraints with an eye to a new 
proposal.  Prime Minister Soumare has offered his personal 
assurances to Charge to help keep the effort on track.  End 
summary. 
 
A POSITIVE RESPONSE 
------------------- 
¶2.  (SBU) In a December 20, 2007, letter to President Wade, John J. 
Danilovich, CEO of the MCC, confirmed that Senegal remains eligible 
for Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) funding in 2008.  Ambassador 
Danilovich also outlined a number of steps, with clear time-lines, 
that the GOS should take in order to effectively pursue a possible 
compact.  President Wade replied positively in a January 25 letter, 
stating that his administration will take the steps necessary to 
create a proposal that meets all MCC criteria.  President Wade also 
indicated that Prime Minister Cheikh Hadjibou Soumare will lead 
Senegal's effort.  In a January 30 letter, the Prime Minister 
confirmed Senegal's willingness to pursue a compact as outlined by 
Ambassador Danilovich and noted that the GOS was already 
establishing a counterpart agency, to be headed by Mr. Ibrahima Dia, 
who was the number two official at Senegal's previous counterpart 
agency, the AMPMD. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) On February 4, Economic Counselor met with Mr. Dia to 
congratulate him on his appointment and to encourage him to not lose 
any time in standing up his organization.  Dia, whom we assess in a 
favorable light from his time at the AMPMD, was knowledgeable, 
organized, and anxious to host a team from the MCC in order to 
outline the criteria for a new economic constraints analysis.  He 
had already hired most of his core staff and would soon be in a 
fully functional office.  When asked if the government had any 
preconceived ideas for a new compact, Dia said that there were 
always ideas floating around (including one we've frequently heard 
mentioned lately to construct rainwater retention basins).  He 
added, however, that his mandate was to work with the MCC to 
consider proposals based on new analysis, not previous ideas.  At 
the same time, he mentioned that, in his view, a compact focusing on 
boosting rural incomes would be of tremendous benefit to the 
country. 
 
PRIME MINISTER SOUMARE IS ON-BOARD 
---------------------------------- 
¶4.  (SBU) The Charge d'Affaires met with Prime Minister Soumare on 
February 13 to acknowledge the positive responses sent by President 
Wade and the PM.  The CDA underscored that the MCC is ready to work 
in collaboration with the GOS, but having failed to conclude a 
compact on two proposals after significant effort and cost, this 
current effort was vitally important if the GOS was indeed serious 
about receiving MCC funding.  PM Soumare expressed his complete 
agreement.  He demonstrated an understanding of how MCC works, 
confirmed the government's willingness to support the chronology 
that Ambassador Danilovich outlined, and offered his intention to 
follow the program's progress at each step.  The PM also introduced 
Mr. Diatourou Ndiaye, Economist and Special Advisor to the Prime 
Minister, who is the PM's designated point-person for the MCC. 
Soumare said that if there were any problems with the effort that 
Mr. Ndiaye needs to know so that it can be reported back to the PM. 
 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
¶5.  (SBU) At this point, we are guardedly optimistic that Senegal 
will make a sincere effort to follow MCC guidelines and requirements 
in order to develop a sensible and timely compact proposal.  The 
exchange with the Prime Minister was direct, but also positive and 
sincere.  He offered his personal pledge to the CDA to do all he can 
to keep Senegal's latest, perhaps last, MCC program on track.  We 
hope it will help that Soumare is a technocrat and not an ambitious 
politician caught up in "palace intrigues" as was the previous Prime 
Minister.  The key to concluding a compact, however, will rest in 
the willingness of the country's most powerful players to refrain 
from viewing MCC funding as a potential source of lucrative deals 
that can benefit the inner circle.
