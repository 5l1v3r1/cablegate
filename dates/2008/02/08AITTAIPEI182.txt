SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: TAIWAN'S UN REFERENDUM 
 
 
Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies continued to focus 
news coverage February 5 on the March presidential election and the 
UN referenda, on the upcoming Lunar New Year holidays, and on the 
epilogue for the family members of fugitive tycoon Wang You-theng, 
who remain in custody.  In terms of editorials and commentaries, an 
editorial in the centrist, KMT-leaning "China Times" discussed the 
UN referenda to be held in tandem with the presidential election in 
March.  The article said the UN referenda have created a predicament 
for both the Blue and Green camps.  End summary. 
 
[Ed. Note:  AIT will close for Chinese New Year until February 12, 
Â¶2008.  This will be the last Media Reaction until then.  We wish 
everyone a happy and prosperous Year of the Rodent!] 
 
"The Referenda May Not Be Able to Be Bundled with the Presidential 
Election, But They Sure Can Tie up Frank Hsieh!" 
 
The centrist, KMT-leaning "China Times" [circulation: 400,000] 
editorialized (2/5): 
 
"... In other words, the 'referenda bundled with the presidential 
election' in March this year have created a certain kind of 
'predicament' for both the Blue and Green camps.  The situation is 
especially so for the Green camp.  On Frank Hsieh's part, because 
the 'UN referendum' involves the fundamental beliefs of the DPP, 
which is the key point that differentiates the party from the Blue 
camp, it left Hsieh no room to dodge or maneuver.  The question thus 
lies in whether Hsieh wants to treat the UN referendum as the 
principal idea of his campaign for the presidency.  The dilemma that 
Hsieh now faces is that, if he pushes strongly for the UN 
referendum, it will surely trigger intense reactions from Washington 
and Beijing.  The high-ranking U.S. officials' criticism of the UN 
referendum was originally aimed at Chen Shui-bian, and it is 
certainly not an outcome that Hsieh will be happy to see if 
Washington turns and aims the rifle barrel at Hsieh.  In the same 
light, manipulating the UN referendum will also escalate [tension] 
across the Taiwan Strait.  Compared with the various campaign 
policies Hsieh has proposed in an effort to ease restrictions on 
Taiwan's investments on the mainland, that would be akin to Hsieh's 
slapping himself in the face. 
 
"The second reason that Hsieh may not be willing to disclose was 
that, once he regards the 'UN referendum' as a major idea for his 
campaign for the presidency, it will be, without a doubt, paramount 
to his declaration that he will follow the line picked by Bian [i.e. 
President Chen].  Or even, it will indicate that he has again put 
Bian back into the fulcrum of the campaign, and surely he and Bian 
will be linked together. ..."
