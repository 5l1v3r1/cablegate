SUBJECT:  French Foreign Minister visits DRC 
 
 
¶1. French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner pledged France's support 
for the Kivus conference's Acte d'Engagement during his January 
25-26 visit to Kinshasa and Goma and announced his government's 
intention to open two new consulates in the DRC to assist in 
implementing the peace process.  Following their January 25 meeting 
in Kinshasa, President Kabila told the press he would send all FDLR 
fighters back to Rwanda, including those responsible for genocide, 
and asked Kouchner to deliver that message to Rwandan President 
Kigame when he arrived in Kigali. 
 
¶2. Koucher expressed a desire to strengthen bilateral relations in 
his meeting with Kabila, a theme he reinforced in with Prime 
Minister Gizenga the same day.  He expressed hope that the DRC would 
host the first post-2008 Francophonie summit.  He recognized that 
France had been "cut off" from the DRC for several years and would 
like to renew their friendship.  He announced that France was ready 
to make further financial commitments in addition to the $294 
million it had pledged in March 2007 to assist the Congolese 
education, health and environmental sectors. 
 
¶3. Kouchner flew to Goma January 26, where he met with National 
Assembly President Vital Kamerhe.  He also visited the Mugunga IDP 
camp outside of Goma and Heal Africa, a local hospital that 
specializes in treating victims of sexual violence. 
 
¶4.  Note:  Press reports indicated that the new consulates would be 
situated in Goma and Bukavu. In fact, the French Embassy's political 
counselor told us January 31 that his government had yet to decide 
on their locations.  End note.
