SUBJECT: PANAMA: CUBA DEMARCHE DELIVERED 
 
REF: STATE 18320 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William A. Eaton.  Reasons:  1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
(C) "Do not expect us to make any public comment," First VP 
and FM Samuel Lewis told Ambassador on February 24 in 
response to reftel demarche.  Repeating an oft stated desire 
to serve as "bridge to Cuba," Lewis asserted that Panama was 
pushing Cuba to do "something" themselves before "external 
pressure" created an impetus for reform, but Lewis provided 
no specifics as to what "something" might constitute.  Hoping 
for positive developments, Lewis noted that it would be 
important to see who would be selected as Vice President and 
members of the State Council.  Asserting that he perceived 
"signals that Raul would implement change," Lewis said that 
he thought there would be more movement towards "greater 
democracy," "transparency," and "economic liberalization." 
Also, Lewis informed Ambassador that Panamanian President 
Martin Torrijos would likely travel to Cuba in the 
(unspecified) near future for medical treatment for his 
handicapped daughter.  Comment:  Post has no expectations 
that Panama will do anything public any time soon to pressure 
for democratic change, greater respect for human rights 
norms, or any other reform in Cuba.
