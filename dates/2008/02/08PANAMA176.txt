Summary and Comment 
------------------- 
 
¶1.  (C) Panamanian President Martin Torrijos extended his 
"sincere congratulations" to Cuban President Raul Castro for 
his "well deserved designation to the highest government 
position in the Republic of Cuba, as a result of the very 
right and unanimous decision by the honorable Cuban General 
Assembly," an MFA press release announced on February 27. 
The press release expressed the desire to "strengthen even 
more during" Raul Castro's term the "frank relationships of 
friendship and cooperation that currently exist.  The letter 
was sent on February 24.  This glowing statement is in 
keeping with the Torrijos Administration's continuing desire 
to refrain from doing anything that would alienate Cuba. 
Continuing to present itself to the USG as a "bridge" to 
Cuba, Panama is also unlikely to do anything public that 
would cause it to incur Cuban wrath or even discomfort.  The 
use of the term "frank" is curious, as there appears to be a 
lack of candor in the Cuba-Panamanian bilateral relationship.
