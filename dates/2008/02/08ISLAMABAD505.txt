SUBJECT: AMIN FAHEEM: SINCERE BUT UNPREPARED TO BE PRIME 
MINISTER 
 
Classified By: Anne W. Patterson, for reasons 1.4 (b)(d) 
 
¶1.  (C) Summary.  Ambassador met January 31 with Amin Faheem,  the Pakistan People's Party Vice-Chairman, who confirmed the  party will not decide on a candidate for Prime Minister until  after the February 18 elections.  Faheem continues to remain  open to working in a coalition with Musharraf's party (and  others) and saw no reason to impeach Musahrraf for his  activities during the state of emergency.  With no personal  security and no plans to campaign on a national level,  Faheem's self-effacing sincerity makes him an unconvincing  candidate for Prime Minister.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  (C)  Ambassador and Polcouns met January 31 with Pakistan  People's Party (PPP) Vice Chairman Amin Faheem at the  Islamabad home of Air Vice Marshall Rahim Yousefzi (ret).  Faheem said he was recovering from the flu and continued to  feel the after-effects of being in the car with Benazir  Bhutto when she was assassinated on December 27.  He has  trouble hearing in his left ear and continued pain in his  chest and shoulder from the effect of the blast. 
  Election Fraud 
-------------- 
 
¶3. (C) Faheem and Yousefzi recounted several continuing PPP  allegations of vote rigging.  They claimed the nazims  (mayors) are disbursing money and controlling the police who  will be assigned law and order duties on election day.  This  will be a problem if there is a ""tussle"" where political  party polling agents disagree on results and the police are  not impartial arbitrators.  Faheem supported PPP calls for  deploying the Army at polling stations on election day. 
  Security 
-------- 
 
¶4.  (C)  In response to Ambassador's concern, Faheem said he  has no personal security.  The PPP insisted he now use a  driver, but he has no armored car and no bodyguards.  The GOP  has provided PPP Co-Chairman Asif Zardari with two police car  escorts.  The PPP will begin campaigning again (post  Muharram) and will divide up responsibilities across the  country.  Faheem will campaign in Sindh, where he says he has  security protection from a supportive constituency. 
 
  Electoral Prospects 
------------------- 
 
¶5.  (C)  Faheem predicted the PPP will do well in Sindh and  would sweep the country if the elections were free and fair. 
Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz will do well in central Punjab  and Lahore, but Pervaiz Elahi's Pakistan Muslim League (PML)  will do well in Punjab as well.  Support for the PML has  declined because of power outages and rising flour prices. 
  Post Election 
------------- 
 
¶6.  (C)  Confirming other reports, Faheem said that the PPP  Central Executive Committee will decide the party's candidate  for Prime Minister.  This will not occur until after the  election. 
 
¶7.  (C)  Faheem said his goals are to focus on fighting  terrorism, improving the economy and tacking the law and  order problem  For this, Pakistan needs a national unity  government.  He is prepared to work with PML, the Muttahida  Quami Movement (MQM) and Nawaz Sharif.  Faheem does not want  to see post-election violence and thinks the PPP can work  with the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam leader Fazlur Rehman to counter  extremist threats.  Benazir Bhutto had worked with Fazlur  before because he is a pragmatist.  Yousefzi was more  derisive, saying Fazlur works with everyone for a price. 
 
¶8. (C)  Saying he had met with Musharraf and found him  sincere, Faheem said he saw no need for a post-election  effort to impeach Musharraf because of his actions during the  state of emergency.  On the National Reconciliation Order  which reportedly expires on February 4, Faheem said there  were differing legal opinions on its continued validity. 
  ISLAMABAD 00000505  002 OF 002 
 
  Personally, he did not want to fight PML and MQM after the  elections.  It was time to work for the future.  Again,  Yousefzi was more critical, citing Musharraf's continued  support for the rule of ""radical mullahs"" in the Northwest  Frontier Province an the lack of a GOP strategy for  countering a growing extremist militancy. 
 
¶9.  (C)  Comment: Faheem continues to leave the impression of  being mild-mannered, sincere and unprepared for being Prime  Minister.  He is not even attempting to campaign on a  national basis, has no security, and is taking a very  gentlemanly approach to growing challenges within the PPP to  his nomination as Prime Minister.  If the PPP wins and he  becomes Prime Minister, it is likely that Faheem will be  taking orders behind the scenes from the more assertive and  focused Asif Zardari.
