¶1. SUMMARY: Embassy Ag office is now aware of six outbreaks of Avian 
Influenza (AI), three of which have confirmed lab results and have 
been reported to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) by 
TurkeyQs Ministry of Agriculture.  The Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations (FAO) office in Turkey has 
expressed some concern about the most recent outbreaks since they 
occurred near commercial poultry operations. Contact with wild birds 
continues to be the cause of the outbreaks according to FAO and EU 
reps in Ankara.  They also believe that the GOTQs response to the AI 
outbreaks has been sufficient but increased surveillance in wetland 
areas and additional public education outreach is needed.  End 
summary. 
 
¶2. On February 13, Embassy Ag Couns met with veterinary experts in 
FAOQs Ankara office to discuss the current bird flu situation in 
Turkey. Overall, FAO reps are satisfied that villagers are reporting 
cases to officials and have good cooperation with local 
veterinarians.  However, they categorized the current situation in 
Turkey as QriskyQ since the number of outbreaks is increasing and 
two of the most recent ones were near commercial poultry 
operations. 
 
¶3. As of February 15, Turkey has reported a total of three outbreaks 
to the OIE.  These are laboratory confirmed cases having the Avian 
Influenza H5N1 virus.  In addition to these three outbreaks, Turkey 
has notified the EU, but not yet to the OIE, of three others for 
which rapid tests have been positive and one for which the rapid 
test was negative.  It appears that the Turkish Ministry of 
Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA) has taken the necessary culling 
and quarantine measures. (Quarantine takes place until there is no 
longer risk of the disease, approximately 42 days after the Qend of 
the infectionQ period, which is when all disinfecting and cleaning 
measures have been taken to remove all possible infected items from 
the area.) 
 
¶4. Summary and details of the outbreaks in 2008: 
 
The three cases reported to the OIE: 
a) January 18 - Sazkoy Village, Zonguldak province Q 583 total bird 
deaths (573 were culled in 5 villages). 
b) January 26 Q Yorukler village, Samsun province Q 57 total bird 
deaths (37 culled). 
c) February 1 Q Yenicam village, Sakarya province Q 3,646 total bird 
deaths (3,593 culled). 
d) 
Two additional suspected outbreaks occurring after February 1 and 
awaiting lab confirmation, according to FAO and EU epidemiologists: 
a) Konacik village, Sakarya province Q 1,119 total bird deaths 
b) Perme district, Samsun province Q 48 total bird deaths 
 
Another suspicious case occurred in Samsun province but initial 
rapid test results were negative so no culling was done. 
 
¶5. FAO staff is concerned because as a result of the third reported 
case, culling had to take place in villages on the border of Kocaeli 
province, a poultry producing area with about 250,000 broilers and 
layers.  If more outbreaks occur in this area, it could pose a 
threat to commercial producers. 
 
¶6. All experts believe that the source of the virus is wild birds 
but spread of the virus can be controlled by biosafety measures. 
FAO experts continue to work closely with the EU Avian Influenza 
response and preparedness team in Turkey to improve biosecurity.  A 
team will go to Samsun and Sakarya provinces next week to collect 
samples from wild birds to assess the role of wild birds in recent 
outbreaks. 
 
¶7. According to local FAO epidemiologists, MARAQs response to this 
yearQs AI outbreaks is satisfactory but more surveillance is needed 
in wetland areas.  They also believe that the public education

program needs to be evaluated and more tailored to target audiences 
with clear, simple messages.  FAO reps also recommend a 
comprehensive study of wild birds in Turkey.
