RESIGNATION; SAO PAULO 
 
¶1. "Fidel's Resignation" 
 
Liberal, largest national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo (2/20) 
editorialized: "The impact of Fidel Castro's resignation is above 
all a symbolic one.  In practical terms, it only makes official the 
situation that has existed since July 2006, when the dictator began 
his medical treatment.... Fidel's brother, Ral Castro, and a group 
of younger and supposedly more pragmatic leaders will have the 
responsibility of continuing a slow and gradual transition not to 
democracy, but towards a more open economy tailored according to the 
Chinese model. In the political area, if Fidel Castro's successors 
have the opportunity, they will keep intact the authoritarian nature 
of the regime and the sole party system. Obviously, such strategies 
are easier to conceive than to execute.... The financial support 
being provided by Hugo Chvez is an element that helps the 
continuation plan of the Cuban dictatorship. It is up to the 
international community to influence the economic opening attempted 
by Havana to become a political opening too.  Washington's role in 
this change will be the determining factor....  The ideal would be 
that the USG alleviate the economic sanctions imposed on Havana." 
 
¶2. "Fidel's Testament" 
 
Center right national circulation daily O Estado de S. Paulo's lead 
editorial maintained (2/20): "One should not expect major openings 
in the Castroist regime in the near future.... Even outside the 
formal structure of power - both in the state and in the party - 
Fidel will continue to exert strong influence on Cuba's destiny, 
maybe until his death. Since he replaced his brother, Ral Castro 
has publicly shown a wish to conduct economic reforms and initiate a 
diplomatic dialogue with the major Western nations, including the 
US.... He said he wanted to normalize relations with the European 
Union and suggested the opening of a direct dialogue with President 
George Bush. Although he had conditioned all these advances to the 
maintenance of the Castroist regime - i.e., restrictions fundamental 
liberties - the reforms did not happen.... The obstacle, as everyone 
knows, was and will continue to be Fidel."
