Â¶1. (SBU) Ching Cheong, the Straits Times reporter arrested in 2005 
and convicted in 2006 for spying, was released today and is on his 
way to Hong Kong, according to South China Morning Post reporter 
Ivan Zhai.  Zhai speculated that Cheong, whose five-year sentence 
was due to end in 2011, was released as a pre-Chinese New Year 
gesture of goodwill by the Chinese government.
