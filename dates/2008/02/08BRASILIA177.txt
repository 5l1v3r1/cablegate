¶2.  (SBU) Environment, Science and Technology (EST) Counselor 
delivered REFTEL points on January 31 to Counselor Luiz Fernando 
Abbott Galvao in the Ministry of External Relations' Division for 
Disarmament and Sensitive Technologies.  Galvao recalled the USG 
statement about the USG soon distributing a draft document on India 
after the November meeting of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG).  He 
noted that earlier Brazil had submitted comments to the USG on a 
draft NSG policy statement, and per REFTEL, EST Counselor replied 
that most of the comments received had been incorporated into a 
revised draft.  Galvao recognized that the negotiations between 
India and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) were in a 
sensitive stage.  He accepted without comment the information that 
the USG planned to distribute NSG policy statement only after the 
completion of a safeguards agreement between India and the IAEA.
