PROPOSAL 
 
REF: STATE 12905 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  Embassy Jakarta and the European Commission (EC) 
jointly delivered reftel demarche to Mr. Ansari Bukhari, Director 
General of Textiles, Metal and Multifarious Industries, Ministry of 
Industry.  He had not seen the joint proposal yet, so we gave him a 
copy and reviewed the main points.  Bukhari said that the Government 
of Indonesia (GOI) agreed "in principle" to streamlining and 
standardizing labeling but would need to study the proposal more 
closely before committing to publicly co-sponsor or support it.  End 
Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Bukhari explained that the GOI was in process of preparing 
new legislation on labeling requirements driven by concerns over 
consumer protection and controlling illegal transshipments.  He said 
that if the Taft Goods proposal simplifies labeling, Indonesia would 
consider supporting it.  Bukhari expressed reservations though on 
supporting any measure that while ostensible streamlining 
requirements would actually complicate them.  He added "Indonesia 
has had bad experiences" with regulations that in effect become new 
technical barriers to trade, especially for small businesses. He 
mentioned specific concerns on requirements relating to textile 
content (which could become an issue as the proposal allows for 
fiber content.) 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Bukhari explained that that Indonesian industry have so 
far not complained over labeling requirements on their exports, but 
saw the advantage of reduced cost through harmonized labeling 
requirements.  He promised to study the proposal and share it with 
his intra-ministerial colleagues and advise us if the GOI has any 
specific objections.
