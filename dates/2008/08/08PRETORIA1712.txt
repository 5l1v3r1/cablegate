------------------------------------------- 
Rand Strengthens as Trade Deficit Decreases 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) The rand rose to a six-month high against the dollar after 
South Africa's trade deficit narrowed unexpectedly last month.  The 
local currency climbed as much as 0.8% to R7.33 to the dollar, the 
strongest level since February 4.  The South African Revenue Service 
(SARS) said the deficit fell from R1.7 billion ($233 million) in May 
to R183 million ($25 million).  "The more favorable trade balance, 
despite remaining in deficit territory, is a welcome reprieve after 
reflecting an average monthly deficit of R6.5 billion ($890 million) 
in the year to date," Standard Bank Economist Shireen Darmalingam 
said.  SARS figures reflect a trade deficit of R34.2 billion ($4.7 
billion) for the year to date.  Exports rose 6.1% in June, mainly as 
a result of robust growth in exports of jewelry, especially gold. 
Exports of mineral and chemical products also rose strongly, 
contributing R2.7 billion ($370 million) to export revenue.  Growth 
in exports of vehicles remained robust, rising 45.8% y/y.  The rise 
in these categories was partly countered by a decline in exports of 
base metals, which fell by R4 billion ($548 million).  Imports 
stayed resilient in June, increasing from R57.9 billion ($7.9 
billion) in May to R60.3 billion ($8.3 billion) - an increase of 
4.2% after declining 12.5% in the previous month.  Imports of 
mineral products such as oil were again the main reason for the 
increase in imports, with most other categories relatively unchanged 
over the month.  (Business Day, August 1, 2008) 
 
------------------------ 
Inflation Races to 11.6% 
------------------------ 
 
¶3. (U) Statistics South Africa (StatsSA) announced that CPIX 
inflation (consumer inflation excluding mortgage costs) surged from 
10.9% in May to 11.6% in June, exceeding consensus market forecasts 
for an 11.3% increase.  CPIX inflation has now breached its 3%-6% 
official target range for 15 months in a row.   Prices for food and 
fuel were once again the main culprits.  Food prices increased by a 
shocking 18.2% y/y, while transport costs increased 17.4% y/y in 
June.  The Reserve Bank has raised the policy interest rate by five 
percentage points to 12% since June 2006 in a bid to curb mounting 
Qpercentage points to 12% since June 2006 in a bid to curb mounting 
price pressures, primarily sparked by rising food and fuel costs. 
The annual rise in CPIX is expected to climb above 13% later this 
year, as the effect of steep hikes in electricity tariffs feeds into 
consumer prices.  That will in turn put upward pressure on inflation 
expectations and pay settlements, which some economists believe 
could prompt the South African Reserve Bank to raise interest rates 
on August 14.   (Business Day, July 31, 2008) 
 
-------------------------------------- 
China to Extend Acquisitions in Africa 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) High-level bankers from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of 
China (ICBC) and from Standard Bank, respectively China and Africa's 
 
PRETORIA 00001712  002.2 OF 005 
 
 
biggest banks, are examining potential targets in Africa's oil and 
gas, ICT, base metals and power sectors, according to executives at 
Standard Bank. They said that the resulting deals would be worth at 
least $5.5 billion, the size of the 20% stake in Standard purchased 
last year by ICBC.  Standard intends to use the connection with ICBC 
to open doors to Chinese investors and guide them into Africa. 
Standard has a presence in 18 sub-Saharan Africa countries.  The 
banking executives said that Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo, 
and Angola are ripe for Chinese deals.  (Financial Times, July 30.) 
 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Bad Bank Loans on Rise in South Africa 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) The South African Reserve Bank's (SARB) 2007 Supervision 
Annual Report noted that South Africa's banking system is sound and 
profitability is strong, but conceded that bad debts are rising as 
borrowing costs increase.  Non-performing loans in the commercial 
banking sector increased from R18.8 billion ($2.6 billion) at the 
end of 2006 to R29.4 billion ($4 billion) at the end of 2007, and 
continued to grow into 2008.  By the end of May, bad loans, 
including a tighter change in definition after the implementation of 
Basel 2 standards, had grown to R55.7 billion ($7.6 billion), which 
accounted for 2.5% of total loans and advances.  The ratio has 
averaged about 1% in the past.  However, SARB's Registrar of Banks 
Errol Kruger said there was no cause for alarm, with the capital 
adequacy ratio still high at more than 12% and banks closely 
monitoring the situation.  "It would not be correct to say it is not 
a worry but it is not a surprise ... there are no red lights 
flashing," he said, adding. "I am very happy to report that the 
banks are in good shape." Local banks have no direct exposure to the 
global credit crisis, but domestic conditions have deteriorated due 
to tighter monetary policy and rising prices.  The SARB report 
showed that banks' profitability remained solid due to strong asset 
growth.  Total net income after taxes rose 20.6% y/y to R31.8 
billion ($4.4 billion) at the end of December 2007, while the 
cost-to-income ratio stood at 50.6% in May 2008. Total industry 
assets increased to R2.86 trillion ($392 billion) by the end of May.

Trade Talks Collapse Bad for South Africa 
----------------------------------------- 
 
 
¶6. (U) Business Unity South Africa (BUSA) said it was disappointed 
by the news that the latest round of negotiations at the World Trade 
Organization (WTO) had failed to reach agreement.  It was clear that 
some progress was made on key matters related to agricultural and 
industrial negotiations. "South African business regrets that it was 
not possible to cement these movements and address other outstanding 
issues, including some of those of specific concern for South 
Africa," BUSA said.  The status quo now remained for the foreseeable 
future. "This means that South African exports will continue to face 
competition from subsidized products from other countries," noted 
BUSA CEO Jerry Vilakazi.  With the collapse of the WTO talks, the 
QBUSA CEO Jerry Vilakazi.  With the collapse of the WTO talks, the 
possibility of redressing the imbalance in the global trading system 
in favor of developing countries was also put on ice.  BUSA said it 
remained committed to working with the government and other 
stakeholders in continuing to actively participate in WTO 
negotiations.  (Beeld, August 31, 2008)

MIDP Rewrite 'Poses Risk to Car Exporters' 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶7. (U) South Africa's vehicle sector is deeply concerned about the 
revised architecture of the Motor Industry Development Program 
(MIDP), with insiders warning that major exporters and 
capital-intensive producers in particular stand to lose.  South 
Africa was forced to review the program as it does not comply with 
World Trade Organization (WTO) rules.  Material changes, notably a 
shift from an export-based incentive to a production allowance, may 
not be attractive enough to keep export-oriented manufacturers based 
in South Africa.  BMW and DaimlerChrysler would be hit hard, as they 
export 80% and 60%, respectively, of their total production.  After 
a consultative session with the team reviewing the MIDP, it is 
understood that virtually all segments of industry are unhappy with 
 
PRETORIA 00001712  003.2 OF 005 
 
 
the new structure and its implications for profitability.  The 
sector is already under pressure with a decline in demand for cars. 
One insider said the latest draft was "WTO compatible, but does not 
support industry".  The new scheme is expected to be released at the 
end of August 2008.  (Business Day, July 28, 2008) 
 
--------------------------------- 
OECD Report Questions MIDP Policy 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶8. (U) The 30-member Organization for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) criticized South Africa's Motor Industry 
Development Program (MIDP) in its first report on the country.  The 
OECD said, "Such a support program is often justified by the 'infant 
industry' argument.  The extent to which such an argument may apply 
to a sector essentially driven by foreign direct investment is, 
however, questionable, as is the quasi-permanent character of the 
subsidies."  The OECD report contended that there is a risk of waste 
and misallocation of resources, as these policies often further 
distort competition between industries or firms.  OECD Secretary 
General Angel Gurra suggested that a more detailed cost-benefit 
study be undertaken to establish the validity of the MIDP.  However, 
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) Director-General Tshediso 
Matona recently defended the economics behind sustained 
automotive-industry support.  Matona said the new program would 
shift the emphasis away from the current export focus, to one that 
emphasized 'scale' in the production of vehicles, and was supportive 
of the development of world-class component manufacturing.  "Through 
the MIDP, we know now that we have the capacity to produce 
high-quality cars for export.  We now need to develop the economies 
of scale so as to reduce production costs and to deepen the 
components industry.  Those are the two main pillars of the new 
support instrument," Matona said.  (Engineering News, July 25, 2008) 
 
 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Gautrain Might not be Ready for World Cup 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶9. (U) Bombela Concession Company CEO Jerome Govender announced that 
the Gauteng Provincial Government has not yet committed to 
accelerate construction of the rapid-rail Gautrain project.  The 
Gautrain is a public-private partnership between the provincial 
government and Bombela, a consortium consisting of international 
partners.  Govender emphasized that the first-phase of construction 
was contracted for 45-months and would not be completed until the 
end of June 2010.  This means the system will not be operational in 
time for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, which starts on June 9.  "We need 
a change in the contract - an instruction from government to 
accelerate the project - to achieve [a] May target," said Govender. 
"We were never contracted to finish the project in time for the 
World Cup."  The provincial government will have to increase the 
budget to acquire the additional resources necessary to speed up 
construction, should it want the airport link to be completed in 
time.  The second phase of the project -which links Johannesburg and 
Pretoria- is set to be completed by April 2011.  Gautrain Project 
Leader Jack van der Merwe said the project team will only know by 
QLeader Jack van der Merwe said the project team will only know by 
mid-2009 whether it will possible to meet the May 2010 target.

End of Load Shedding for Johannesburg - City 
  Power - Wishful Thinking? 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶10. (U) The City of Johannesburg municipal power supplier City Power 
assured consumers that load shedding was a thing of the past, 
asserting that City Power had enough electricity even if state power 
supplier Eskom requested a cut in supply.  City Power Managing 
Director Silas Zimu asserted that the municipality's mitigation 
program had been successful in producing more than 500 MW of 
additional power.  "Even if Eskom asked us to load shed, we won't as 
the City of Johannesburg," said City Councilor Roslynn Greef.  City 
Power has trumpeted a number of positive planning measures, 
including the installation of smart meters, establishing pricing 
incentives, seeking to refurbish inactive gas turbines, and creating 
a "virtual power station" based on massive installation of solar 
water heaters.  However, implementation is still a challenge.

Johannesburg consumes about 3,500 MW of power, compared to 3,200 MW 
in Paris.   (Engineering News, Star, Business Day, July 29, 2008) 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
The Next, Bigger Crisis - Power Distribution 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶11. (U) The failure to overhaul the power distribution sector could 
cause the next crisis in the electricity industry.  The government 
has tacitly admitted that it has failed to overhaul South Africa's 
vast electricity distribution industry since a plan to consolidate 
the sector was first put on the agenda 13 years ago.  "One of the 
lessons I have learnt in this process is that this restructuring is 
extremely complex - it cuts across all spheres of government and we 
need constant consultations and persuasion.  It if was really 
simple, we would have done it long ago," says Nellie Magubane, the 
DME's deputy director in charge of electricity.  "It is not just 
about legislation - it is about money, and the issues are also 
political."  Electricity is currently distributed by Eskom and 187 
municipalities - the fragmented system has been fraught with 
financial inefficiency, management problems, and lack of investment 
in maintenance and capacity, especially at the local government 
level.  The government's restructuring plan would entail that Eskom 
and the 187 municipalities distributing power be split into six 
Regional Electricity Distributors (REDS), which would be easier to 
regulate and manage.  It would also provide a better way to raise 
commercial financing.  The REDS fall under the state-owned 
Electricity Distribution Industry Holdings (EDI).  However, the plan 
has proved unworkable, because it relies on municipalities and Eskom 
to voluntarily cede to the REDS their power distribution function, 
assets, revenues, and staff - without addressing the issues that 
affect the REDS.  Unless there is a constitutional amendment to give 
national government power over electricity distribution, 
municipalities will cling to their right to distribute power because 
it is their largest single source of income.  With municipal 
finances in a mess, the lack of investment in electricity 
distribution could worsen and cause the next power crisis.

South Africa Stopped Zimbabwe Power 
  Exports Months Ago 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶12. (U) South Africa stopped supplying electricity to Zimbabwe 
several months ago, according to Eskom CEO Jacob Maroga.   He said 
there was no political motive.  "It is simply a contractual issue. 
They had been paying for their electricity in advance for the last 
two to three years.  They simply stopped making new orders."   He 
said there was no outstanding debt.  Eskom said it believed Zimbabwe 
was continuing to pay for electricity imports from other regional 
countries, which could include Mozambique, Zambia, and the DRC.  It 
could also include Botswana, but Botswana's government has been 
particularly critical of Mugabe since the election.   (Engineering 
News, July 30, 2008) 
 
------------------------------------ 
Government Proposes New Carbon Taxes 
------------------------------------ 
Q------------------------------------ 
 
¶13. (U) Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism (DEAT) 
Minister Marthinus Van Schalkwyk announced a cabinet-endorsed 
proposal to introduce incentives and taxes aimed at reducing carbon 
emissions.  The Minister said that although the tax structure has 
not yet been defined, the cabinet has instructed the National 
Treasury to investigate the issue and propose new incentives and 
taxes.  Van Schalkwyk warned that the policy reform could change 
South Africa's economic structure over the coming years by 
encouraging drastic emission reductions in the transportation sector 
and forcing a shift towards public transport.  The new policy could 
also intensify the development of hybrid and electric cars.  As a 
coal-based economy, South Africa is listed among the world's largest 
carbon dioxide emitters.  The government is seeking to nudge 
businesses to adopt green programs and cleaner production cultures. 
Critics of the proposed taxes argued that the move would be 
counter-productive.  Chemical and Allied Industries Association CEO 
Laurain Lotter said that the taxes would add significantly to the 
cost of doing business in South Africa and urged that the government 
explore other options.  (Business Day, July 29, 2008)

Climate Change Could Destroy Species in Kruger 
  National Park 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶14. (U) The Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism Marthinus 
Van Schalkwyk told a climate change conference in Cape Town that 
climate change, if not kept in check, could lead to the extinction 
of certain animals in the Kruger National Park.  Van Schalkwyk cited 
a United Nations Panel on Climate Change report which indicated that 
a 2.5% rise in temperature could bring about the extinction of 24% 
to 40% of mammals, 28% to 40% of birds, and 21% to 45% of reptiles 
in the popular conservation park.  He encouraged all countries to 
fight the eminent catastrophe of climate change.  He also added that 
"South Africa had to take very difficult and important decisions 
relating to its own efforts to reduce and avoid emissions."  He said 
the country can longer afford not to engage in emission reduction 
efforts.  According to Van Schalkwyk, South Africa is on the path to 
building a low carbon economy, and to developing mitigation and 
adaptation mechanisms.  (Pretoria News, July 22, 2008)

CITES Criticized for Authorization for 
Ivory Sales to China 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶15. (U) The Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species 
(CITES) has approved the sale of 108 tons of African ivory to China. 
 It noted China's improved crackdown and control of illegal domestic 
ivory trade as justification for the approval.  Botswana (44 tons), 
Namibia (9 tons), South Africa (51 tons), and Zimbabwe (4 tons) will 
be authorized to conduct a once-off sale of their ivory stocks. 
CITES will closely monitor the ivory sales, while the proceeds will 
be allocated to elephant conservation.  The governments are pleased 
with the CITES authorization, but animal right activists are 
enraged.  Animal Rights Africa (ARA) is concerned that South 
Africa's authorized sale of 51 tons represents approximately 16,000 
elephants.  ARA figures indicate that 20,000 elephants are killed 
annually to service illegal ivory trade.  ARA spokesperson Michel 
Pickover accused South Africa of not being in solidarity with the 
other African states in opposing ivory trade.  Eighteen African 
nations are opposed to the sales.  (Bua News, The Star, and Pretoria
