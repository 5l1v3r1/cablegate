SUBJECT: ANNOUNCING A NEW CHINA ESTH ONLINE FORUM--BLUE SKIES OVER 
BEIJING 
 
¶1. Embassy Beijing is pleased to announce the creation of a new 
internal blog on Communities (at) State, designed to provide a forum 
for information sharing and discussion of issues related to 
environment, science, technology, and health issues in China.  "Blue 
Skies Over Beijing" will be administered by staff in the Beijing 
ESTH section, and can be accessed by clicking the following link 
from any Federal agency, office, or employee with a connection to 
Intelink-U. 
 
Blue Skies Over Beijing 
 
http://www.intelink.gov/communities/ 
state/blue_skies_over_beijing/ 
 
State OpenNet users will be able to access the site directly; 
however, some employees in other agencies may be asked to register 
with an ID and password before logging into Intelink-U. 
 
¶2.  The Olympics have focused the world's attention on Beijing's air 
quality, as well as on recent government measures to improve 
environmental conditions and plans for creating a Green Olympics. 
While the Olympics and Paralympics will be over by the end of 
September, we hope this Community will provide a lasting forum for 
interested parties within the USG to discuss environmental policy, 
science and technology cooperation, and health issues related to 
China. 
 
¶3. For those who consider themselves to be members of this 
"community," Beijing ESTH invites you to bookmark and check "Blue 
Skies Over Beijing" often, and we welcome the feedback and 
suggestions of any reader.  Technical difficulties in accessing the 
page can be addressed to the Knowledge Management Action Team in the 
Department of State's Office of eDiplomacy at KMTeam@state.gov.

ESTH Section at BeijingUSEmbassyESTH@state.gov.
