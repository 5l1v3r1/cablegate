Main Stories: 
------------- 
The dailies highlight and Al-Quds leads with reports of escalations 
in tension between Israel and Iran concerning the latter's 
possession of nuclear weapons. In an interview with the Israeli 
Radio on August 27 Deputy Israeli Minister of Defense Matan Vilnai 
is quoted as saying that Israel's enemies have established missile 
systems to attack Israel, for they know they cannot defeat Israel in 
the battlefield. 
 
Al-Quds reports that a high-ranking Palestinian official in the 
Palestinian Presidency revealed that for the first time during her 
discussions with President Mahmud Abbas in Ramallah, U.S. Secretary 
of State Condoleezza Rice referred to the need to establish a 
Palestinian state within the June 1967 borders. The source added 
that, "This is considered a qualitative and clear development on 
part of the American administration vis-a-vis the peace process 
between Palestinians and Israelis." The source confirmed that Rice 
asked both sides to agree on changes to the 1967 borders, and that 
they work on the issue of Jerusalem and try to reach an 
understanding on the religious sites in the city and on the security 
and administrative arrangements for the eastern and western parts of 
the city.  The source added that Rice has informed both sides that 
the American administration will try to compile an understanding 
that includes an international mechanism to compensate Palestinian 
refugees, as part of resolving the conflict. 
 
Al-Ayyam and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida cite an AFP story about Israel's 
intention to ease restrictions on the release of Palestinian 
prisoners in any future exchange deal with Hamas on the release of 
Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. 
 
Al-Quds highlights a report quoting unnamed diplomatic sources in 
East Jerusalem on August 27 that diplomatic missions in Jerusalem 
have complained to Israel about settlement activities in the Sheikh 
Jarrah neighborhood of East Jerusalem. The same sources told Al-Quds 
that two diplomatic missions have officially addressed the Israeli 
authorities in order to stop the settlement project at Karam 
Al-Mufti area, located near consulates and representative offices. 
 
The three dailies report that the PA Ministerial Council expressed 
its support for steps taken by the General Teachers' Union and the 
unions of the health and public employees sectors in the Gaza Strip 
to protest the Hamas government's "practices and measures" against 
the employees in these unions. 
 
The three dailies report that Israeli Minister of Defense Ehud Barak 
gave orders to reopen the crossing points between Israel and the 
Gaza Strip on August 28 after two days of closure.  In addition, the 
Egyptian authorities decided to reopen the Rafah Crossing on August 
30 and August 31 to allow the passage of special cases, including 
people in need of medical care. 
 
All dailies report that the peace activists who arrived in the Gaza 
Strip on the "Free Gaza" boats will leave Gaza on August 28 to 
return to Cyprus. Palestinian Legislator Jamal Al-Khudari is quoted 
saying in a press conference on August 27 in Gaza that the peace 
activists will be accompanied by a number of Palestinians, including 
medical patients, who have been unable to leave the Gaza Strip. 
 
Developments in the Palestinian factional dialogue in Egypt receive 
front-page coverage in all dailies. Al-Quds reports that Palestinian 
Ambassador to Egypt Nabil Amr stated on August 27 that in order for 
 
JERUSALEM 00001610  002 OF 002 
 
 
the national dialogue to succeed, there cannot be two authorities 
for one homeland. He added that Gaza and the West Bank must be 
geographically, politically, and administratively united. Hamas 
leader Ismail Haniyeh is quoted as saying the dialogue is facing 
serious difficulties.

BLOCK QUOTES:

¶1.  Independent Al-Quds runs an editorial entitled, "The National 
Dialogue as Target and not as Logo" (8/28): "[I]nternal and external 
factors, such as competition between the Palestinian factions and 
Arab and international pressure, hinder the achievement of 
Palestinian national unity.  These factors should be the focus of 
official Palestinian statements and declarations.  Fatah and Hamas 
and all other Palestinian factions must join their efforts under 
Arab sponsorship to overcome [these factors]. This is not an 
impossible mission if the intentions were true and if the higher 
national interest was considered above any group or private 
interest..." 
 
¶2.  Al-Ayyam runs an editorial by regular columnist, Dr. Abdul Majid 
Sweilem, entitled, "Cairo Dialogues and Awaiting a Miracle" (8/28): 
"[T]he issues of security, PLO, political program, means of 
struggle, election mechanisms, and the focal points of the political 
system are all big and important issues that are capable of 
developing. Awaiting the miracle of agreement [between the 
Palestinian factions in Cairo], we must be aware that all those who 
consider the unity of the Palestinian cause, people and destiny are 
requested to be ready to deal with a national and popular work 
organized to change facts into a true national and struggle program 
which might be the strategic outlet of the country's crisis..."
