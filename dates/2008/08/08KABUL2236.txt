SUBJECT:  November 2008 Conference on Afghan Refugees 
 
Ref: A - Kabul 1493 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (IROA) and 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) will 
co-host the International Conference on Return and Reintegration in 
Kabul on November 19, 2008. The conference will address the 
difficult issues related to the Afghan refugee population still 
residing in Pakistan and Iran.  UNHCR Kabul hopes to use the 
conference to urge Pakistan (especially) and Iran to change their 
policies of potentially unsustainable and politically sensitive 
levels of repatriation/deportation while offering more reasonable 
alternative targets and implementing arrangements. 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Co-chaired by IROA Foreign Minister Dr. Rangin Dadfar 
Spanta and UNHCR Antonio Guterres, the conference will not be a 
donor's conference but rather a mechanism to seek a policy 
convergence among IROA, neighboring countries (Pakistan and Iran), 
and donor countries on how return and reintegration can be enhanced 
given Afghanistan's limited absorption capacity (Ref A).  UNHCR will 
present a five-year strategy and plan of implementation for return 
and reintegration, based on the costing exercise currently being 
undertaken for the Afghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS) 
for 2009-2013.  The plan would include a realistic level of return 
(maximum 1 million persons over five years), which UNHCR hopes will 
spur donors into increasing resources for existing programs in key 
provinces and sectors.  UNHCR hopes countries will send 
Ministerial-level envoys to the conference with enough clout to 
bring the key players together over a realistic and productive 
outcome. 
 
¶3. (SBU) UNHCR and the IROA Ministry of Refugees and Repatriation 
(MORR) are already sharing ideas informally with Pakistan and Iran 
on the conference agenda.  Through the costing exercise, which will 
provide costs for reintegration by sectors (e.g., education and 
health) and geographic areas, UNHCR hopes to stave off Iran's 
attempts to quantify how much it costs to repatriate or integrate 
one individual.  They fear Iran would use a per/person cost to 
coerce donors to fund that number times a deportation target, e.g., 
$75 million to reintegrate 100,000 deportees at $750 each.  Iran 
would then feel justified in deporting 100,000 Afghans since the 
donor community was paying to reintegrate them. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Given the difficult security and political situations in 
both Afghanistan and Pakistan, and Afghanistan's chronically 
strained relationship with Iran, it seems unlikely that any of the 
three governments will be able to focus enough energy on the 
conference to find agreement on a rational, mutually acceptable 
repatriation and reintegration plan.  One positive outcome could be 
that Pakistan and Iran could take some political cover from the 
conference to walk back slightly from their public positions that 
their Afghan populations should depart (voluntarily) soon -- a 
position that many officials recognize privately as unrealistic but 
dare not voice publicly.  In return, both countries would want a 
strong commitment of continued donor support for programs for Afghan 
refugees and deportees in the three countries through 2013 and 
likely beyond.
