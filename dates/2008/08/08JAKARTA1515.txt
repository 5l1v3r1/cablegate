SUBJECT: MARRIOTT BOMBING VICTIMS COMMEMORATE TRAGIC DAY 
 
REF: (03) JAKARTA 9011 
 
¶1.  (U) SURVIVORS HOST COMMEMORATION:  Survivors of the 
August 5,  2003 Marriott Hotel bombing in Jakarta 
commemorated the five-year anniversary on Tuesday, with a 
prayer led by a Muslim cleric at 12:45 p.m., the moment of 
the bombing.  The attack killed 12 and injured approximately 
150, mostly Indonesians.  The event was hosted by the 8/5 
Foundation, a group of survivors and their families, along 
with the Marriott Hotel. 
 
¶2.  (U) QUICK U.S. RESPONSE APPRECIATED:  Imam Prasojo, chair 
of the Nurani Foundation, which assisted victims after the 
bombing, praised the U.S. Mission for its prompt response. 
He said the Ambassador called him right after the bombing and 
asked how assistance could be directed so that it would 
alleviate suffering immediately.  Working through the Nurani 
Foundation, the Mission contributed a half million dollars in 
USAID funds for victim cash support, medical supplies, 
medical treatment, and follow-up care, USD400,000 of which 
was dispersed within 10 days of the bombing so that victims 
would get immediate relief. 
 
¶3.  (U) MARRIOTT MANAGER STOOD STRONG:  Prasojo also cited 
the work of then Marriott Manager John Jaskula, an American 
who Prasojo said treated Marriott staff as family and made 
sure everyone was attended to during that traumatic time, 
never flinching during recovery efforts. 
 
¶4.  (U) VICTIMS NOT FORGOTTEN:  Several of the Marriott bomb 
victims who continue to suffer from the burns and other 
disabilities spoke at the ceremony about how the bombing 
changed their lives.  Slide shows of the victims before and 
after the bombing punctuated the human devastation of the 
bombing.  8/5 Foundation continues to raise funds for 
victims, and donors made contributions at the ceremony. 
 
¶5.  (U) TERRORIST VICTIMS UNITED:  Foundations to assist the 
October 12, 2002 Bali bombing continue to work with 8/5 and 
other terrorist victim organizations.  Geoffrey Thwaites, an 
Australian whose son was among the young rubgy team players 
who lost their lives at the Bali bombing, attended the 
Marriott commemoration.  Thwaites founded the Zero to One 
Foundation (ZTOF) to assist the victims and their families. 
This foundation has since assisted victims of other attacks 
as well as tsunami victims in Aceh and Nias.
