SUBJECT: RUSSIA SUPPORTS FIFTH ROUND OF WESTERN SAHARA TALKS 
 
REF: STATE 88765 
 
(SBU) We delivered reftel demarche on August 20 to MFA Senior 
Counselor for International Organizations Petr Ilichev, who 
said that Russia supported holding a fifth round of Western 
Sahara talks later this year and preferred that they be led 
by the SYG's Personal Envoy Peter Van Walsum.  Ilichev 
explained that when Van Walsum visited Moscow earlier this 
year, the MFA told him that he maintained Russia's confidence 
as the person most capable of carrying out further 
negotiations on Western Sahara.  Ilichev cautioned, however, 
that considering that the Polisario said that it had "lost 
confidence" in Van Walsum, it might be necessary to "strike a 
balance" between supporting him and responding to "facts on 
the ground."  Ilichev warned against the UN finding itself in 
a situation similar to that in Eritrea, where one party would 
not agree to meet with the representative named by the SYG.
