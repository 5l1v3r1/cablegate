SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK 
ON APPLICATION 050112953 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post's assistance in conducting 
a pre-license check on application 050112953 for the export 
of spare aircraft engine component parts to Taiwan.  Post is 
requested to complete this Blue Lantern check within 30 days. 
 Lack of response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending 
and future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request:  Unfamiliar foreign end-user, Air 
Force Institute of Technology, and unfamiliar foreign 
consignee, Sense Tek.  Neither company has appeared on any 
previous license applications, nor have the bona fides of the 
companies been verified by a Blue Lantern check. 
 
¶4. ACTION:  Department requests that AIT Taipei make 
appropriate inquiries to verify the bona fides of foreign 
end-user Air Force Institute of Technology and foreign 
consignee Sense Tek, and to confirm the legitimacy of this 
proposed transaction.  PM/DTCC also requests that post 
conduct site visits to the companies in order to provide 
Department with an assessment of their business operations 
and on-site security.  Finally, post is asked to assess 
whether the companies appear to be reliable recipients of 
USML items.  If a site visit is not possible, please inform 
the PM/DTCC officer. 
 
The following questions for both companies are provided as 
suggested guidance: 
 
--Does the company have supporting documentation, including 
purchase orders, for this proposed transaction? 
 
--What role will Sense Tek play in the proposed transaction? 
Will Sense Tek be handling or storing the items listed on the 
application?  If so, does it have secure facilities and 
proper accounting and security procedures for handling these 
sensitive USML items? 
 
--What is the exact end-use for this USML item?  How exactly 
will the component be used as a "student training aid"? 
 
--When was the company established and who are its 
principals? 
 
--What is the nature of its business -- what type of items 
does it handle, does it serve as a broker? 
 
--What type of organizations are among its typical customers 
and where are the customers located? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on United 
States Munitions List (USML) items, especially the 
prohibition against unauthorized re-transfers and re-exports? 
 
END ACTION
