     ¶B. STATE 6161 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  During its winter-spring session and under 
U.S. chairmanship, the Open Skies Consultative Commission 
(OSCC) commemorated the 500th observation flight since the 
Open Skies Treaty entered into force.  This "good news" event 
garnered widespread press coverage which emphasized an arms 
control treaty that is working, bringing benefits including 
openness, transparency, and cooperation.  While a collective 
accomplishment for the 34 states parties to the treaty, the 
commemoration also served to underline the positive role of 
the U.S. in European security. 
 
¶2. (SBU) An agreement to allow digital photography is still 
badly needed.  To this end, working group meetings during the 
session included commercial aerial camera manufacturers.  The 
working group Chair (also U.S.) issued a very technical "best 
guess" for an agreement in April.  All countries agreed with 
his proposal except for Russia, which blocked consensus in 
May.  Russian comments were received in July and are under 
study.  The OSCC approved the extension of the mandate for 
this working group through 2008.  During the January-July 
OSCC session, there also was a minor deal with Russia on 
refueling, a semi-reversal by an ally after U.S. demarches, 
and more.  The next OSCC meeting will be on September 22. 
End summary. 
 
U.S. Chairmanship and 500th flight Commemoration 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶3. (SBU) On April 14, the United States began its five-month 
Chairmanship of the OSCC, following Germany's January-March 
chairmanship.  The U.S. emphasized the need for states to 
complete work on the digital video sensor decision.  The U.S. 
delegation also began organization of the commemoration of 
the 500th Open Skies observation flight under the Treaty, 
noting that the 500 number would probably be reached during 
the summer recess in August.  As of July 10, the official 
flight tracker included notifications for 488 flights 
(OSCC.DEL/7/08/Rev 2); on August 1 it had reached 495 
flights. 
 
¶4. (SBU) On July 14, the OSCC held a special plenary session 
to commemorate the conduct of 500 observation flights since 
the Treaty's entry into force in January 2002.  Mission's 
Public Diplomacy section encouraged press coverage and 
organized a media event, including the release of 500 
balloons on the front steps of the Hofburg Palace in symbolic 
commemoration.  The U.S. initiative received strong support 
from all delegations, including financial contributions from 
Italy, Sweden and Lithuania to defray some of the costs. 
U.S. leadership of the event was especially welcomed as a 
sign of commitment to European arms control and security. 
The historical significance of the Treaty on Open Skies was 
linked (by Finnish Ambassador, speaking on behalf of the OSCE 
Chairman-in-Office) under U.S. Chairmanship and former 
President Bush's proposal in May 1989, which initiated the 
successful talks that led to the Treaty. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The 500 balloons provided a visual that garnered 
widespread positive press attention around the world for an 
arms control treaty that is working, bringing benefits 
including openness, transparency, and cooperation.  While a 
collective accomplishment for the 34 states parties to the 
treaty, the commemoration and its widespread press coverage 
underlined the positive role of the U.S. in European 
security.  We are not unaware of any negative coverage or 
comments.  (More details ref A) 
 
Sensor Working Group:  No Deal on Digital Yet 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) On January 21, the OSCC adopted a Decision extending 
the mandate for the Informal Working Group on Sensors (IWGS) 
into 2008 (OSCC.DEC/1/08).  The U.S. Delegation continued to 
emphasize the priority for progress on digital sensor work, 
 
USOSCE 00000200  002 OF 003 
 
 
especially with regard to Revision One to Decision Number 
Fourteen (video).  The IWGS chairman (U.S.) held a meeting 
from February 27-March 7 that included both traditional 
working group sessions and meeting with commercial aerial 
camera manufacturers. 
 
¶7. (SBU) In April, the Chair issued a very technical "best 
guess" version of Decision 14 with the hope that it would be 
acceptable to all.  He requested comments by May 1 
(OSCC.SEN/4/08).  In early-May, however, Russia said it was 
withholding consensus.  It provided comments on this version 
in July.  These comments were still under careful study when 
the winter-spring session ended. 
 
Brits Reverse on Outbound Missions after U.S. Demarche 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) In May, delegations learned that the UK would no 
longer be able to fund operation and repairs of the aging 
aircraft it had been using for Open Skies missions.  It 
indicated it would only be able to continue to receive all 
passive quotas (i.e., inbound missions).  Following a U.S. 
demarche, extensive informal consultations, and an offer from 
the U.S. to share an Open Skies flight on a U.S. aircraft, 
the UK revised its position such that it will continue 
flights with partners and/or leased aircraft in 2009.  In 
July, the UK delegation made a clarification statement 
regarding its future intentions for participation under the 
Treaty.  The UK emphasized it continued to value the Treaty, 
and remains committed toward its implementation. 
 
Deal with Russia on Alternate Airfields for Refueling 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) In May and June, Russia and the U.S. exchanged notes 
verbale reflecting a bilateral agreement reached during two 
previous bilateral consultations in August 2006 and 2007. 
The notes specify the procedures for use of alternate 
airfields for refueling stops prior to and during observation 
flights.  The draft decision under discussion in the working 
group is compatible with these bilateral arrangements. 
 
First time:  Sharing Missions with Poland, Georgia 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶10. (SBU) The U.S. has fostered the opportunity to partner 
with countries that can provide aircraft for some of the U.S. 
active quotas.  This year, USDel negotiated arrangements for 
sharing such missions with Poland and Georgia (both for the 
first time), as well as Turkey.  The OSCC Decision on Quota 
Distribution for 2008 was subsequently revised three times 
this session to reflect these new arrangements.  The Decision 
also reflects the U.S. offer to bring representatives from 
the UK and Latvia of joint missions (OSCC.DEC/5/08).  U.S. 
offers for sharing flights continue to build good will with 
Allies. 
 
Rules and Procedures:  Alternate Airfields 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶11. (SBU) In April, Russian Chair (Kozlov) of the Informal 
Working Group on Rules and Procedures (IWGRP) introduced 
three papers (a food for thought and two draft decision) 
regarding procedures for alternate airfields.  Working group 
discussion from May)July resulted in a consolidated text 
provided by Slovakia.  Russia agreed this text could serve as 
the basis for future discussion (OSCC.RP/13/08). 
 
¶12. (SBU) In July, the OSCC adopted a Decision 
(OSCC.DEC/4/08) that applies a scale of distribution of OSCC 
expenses that reflects the OSCE permanent council scale for 
2008 and 2009. 
 
Focus this Fall 
--------------- 
 
¶13. (SBU) USDel expects the fall OSCC round to focus on the 
 
USOSCE 00000200  003 OF 003 
 
 
following issues: 
 
 -- Digital (and other) Sensors:  The sensor working group 
IWGS will continue to discuss draft decisions, including 
recent Russian drafting suggestions; 
 
 -- Annual quota distribution:  a special workshop will be 
held on October 9-10 to organize the active quota 
distribution, as well as to discuss initial deconfliction of 
those quotas over certain states.  The U.S. quota bid for 
2009 should be distributed by mid-September in preparation 
for this meeting.  Germany is organizing the quota meeting 
per modalities paper (OSCC.INF/19/08); 
 
 -- Deconfliction of quotas by quarter will take place after 
the quota distribution decision is adopted at the end of 
October.  First quarter 2009 should be done by November 15; 
 
 -- If all potential mission sharing arrangements for 2009 
are not organized prior to October, delegation will support 
further bilateral consultations upon request; 
 
 -- Rules and Procedures: USDel expects discussion to 
continue on the Slovak drafting proposal of the original 
Russian text for an OSCC decision on alternate airfield 
procedures; 
 
 -- USDel will participate in drafting the standard paragraph 
OSCC contribution to the Ministerial Declaration, and will 
work with its troika partners, Germany and Belarus, to 
prepare the annual OSCC Chairman's Report to OSCE Ministers. 
 
¶15. (SBU) Open Skies activities taking place elsewhere in 
Europe this fall include: 
 
--Romania and POD Group joint aircraft/sensor certification 
event in Bucharest in mid-September; 
 
--Germany is hosting another seminar on future Open Skies 
aircraft options in Berlin October 15-16. 
 
¶16.  (SBU) Although the U.S. is still chair of the OSCC, no 
further meetings are expected under U.S. chairmanship.  The 
next OSCC meeting will be when the Fall 2008 session begins 
on September 22 under chairmanship of Belarus.
