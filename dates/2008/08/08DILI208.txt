Summary 
------- 
¶1. From August 11 - 13, Poloff traveled to the enclave district 
of Oecussi, located within the boundaries of Indonesia's West 
Timor province, to attend a cultural festival and to assess 
border conditions in Timor-Leste's westernmost district.  Travel 
to Oecussi is hampered by requirements for Indonesian visa and 
vehicle permits; public reliance on a weekly ferry service to 
Dili; and a lingering lack of capacity within the National 
Police of Timor-Leste (PNTL) and Timorese Immigration 
institutions, including as lack of radios, computers, and 
telephone links between border posts and Dili.  These 
constraints were underscored this week by mechanical failures 
which caused the suspension of the ferry service, thereby 
stranding in Oecussi over 100 visitors from Dili who traveled to 
attend the enclave's weeklong cultural heritage festival. 
Implementation of a border crossing card system, or the issuance 
of Indonesian visas at the border, would alleviate some of the 
transportation problems.  End summary. 
 
 
Red Tape at the Border 
---------------------- 
 
¶2. The district of Oecussi, surrounded on three sides by 
Indonesia and the Savu Sea to the north, is not contiguous with 
the rest of Timor-Leste.  The only ferry connecting the enclave 
to Dili suspended its weekly service this week for mechanical 
repairs, stranding over 100 passengers who traveled to attend 
the weeklong Oecussi cultural festival (August 10 - 16).  (Note: 
 In an August 18 meeting with visiting U.S. officials, Finance 
Minister Emilia Pires complained the vessel had been sent to 
Surabaya because that Timor-Leste has no indigenous capacity to 
make even minor repairs.  End note.)  Travelers from Oecussi 
overwhelmingly choose the ferry service due to lack of road 
transportation, high fuel costs, and consular requirements (see 
below). 
 
¶3.  For overland travel from Dili to Oecussi, travelers must 
clear Timorese and Indonesian immigration posts at each of the 
two borders.  They must also have both an Indonesian visa and a 
passenger vehicle permit; these are issued only at the 
Indonesian Embassy in Dili. Travelers resort to petty bribery 
when they lack these documents.  Overland vehicle travel 
originating in Oecussi is impractical due to the fact that the 
necessary Indonesian permits cannot be obtained there. 
 
¶4. Red tape is not the only hindrance to travel. On August 11, 
Poloff waited for an hour and a half at the first border 
checkpoint while Timorese immigration officials confirmed from 
the Indonesian Embassy in Dili that the vehicle permit issued to 
the U.S. Embassy vehicle was valid.  Undisciplined border 
personnel was also a problem.  During the return trip to Dili on 
August 13, we waited for two hours at the Oecussi checkpoint for 
the Timorese immigration officer to report for to work.  Several 
PNTL officers on the scene reported that three members of the 
Timor-Leste National Parliament waited the same length of time 
the previous day until the immigration officer's arrival.  In 
spite of the presence of PNTL officers, no one was authorized to 
grant permission to leave Timorese territory into Indonesia 
except the Timorese immigration officer. 
 
Security Challenges 
------------------- 
 
¶5. There are 34 UN Police Mission (UNPOL) officers, 120 PNTL 
officers, over 12 immigration, and 78 Border Patrol officers 
assigned to Oecussi.  The Timorese personnel continue to face 
serious basic capacity challenges. Officers assigned to the 
border post between Oecussi and Indonesia lack radios and 
telephone line reception.  In case of emergency, they would be 
effectively cut off from communications with police, military, 
or immigration officials in Oecussi's district capital Pante 
Maksasar or Dili.  The infrastructures at the Indonesian 
checkpoints were more modern and better stocked with 
communications equipment.  In contrast, Timor's infrastructure, 
especially between Oecussi and West Timor, was dilapidated and 
lacking basic equipment.  One new Timorese immigration structure 
erected last year in Oecussi remains unfinished, and officers 
reported that construction work there was discontinued "months 
ago."

¶6. During conversations with Poloff, PNTL Immigration, and 
Indonesian officials noted that no serious discussion have been 
held between Timor-Leste and Indonesia to revamp border crossing 
procedures.  However, officers from both countries noted they 
are aware of their duty to combat human and drug trafficking, 
although they admitted that the border remains porous and 
vulnerable to undetected illegal entries.  They also 
acknowledged that low salaries may tempt some officers to accept 
bribes, although they alleged that they "personally have not 
known of such a case." 
 
UNPOL mentorship 
---------------- 
 
¶7. PNTL officers in Oecussi are mentored by UNPOL officers, and 
an UNPOL detachment is assigned to work side by side with its 
Timorese counterpart.  The PNTL in Oecussi lack photocopy or fax 
machines, and only have one operational patrol vehicle assigned 
to its unit, three computer terminals donated by the United 
Nations in 2002  Accordingly, the PNTL cannot operate 
independently from UNPOL assistance at this time.  PNTL officers 
also reported that the Oecussi detachment has not received new 
uniforms since 2003, unlike other PNTL units, because it is 
isolated from the rest of the country.  In spite of these 
challenges, UNPOL officers and the PNTL Deputy Commander 
described morale within the PNTL as "good" and praised the 
assistance provided by UNPOL to professionalize the force. 
Women compose over one third of the PNTL force in Oecussi, 
indicating evidence of more opportunities for women within the 
state's security sector.
