¶1. (SBU) Summary: Fears of the demise of Russia's system of 
state-sponsored health care are premature.  The country has an 
enormous potential market for private health care, but the sector is 
still growing.  Private care is primarily available in outpatient 
fields such as cardiology, dentistry and orthodontics, urology, 
obstetrics/gynecology, plastic surgery, and drug dependency 
treatment for those few who can afford its higher costs.  Quality 
varies widely by the type of care and from one facility to another. 
The legal framework necessary to support a broad network of private 
medical institutions with a system of private, or even government, 
insurance is still lacking.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) In recent years, Russian media has criticized the state of 
Russia's health care system.  Although the constitution provides for 
free health care at state expense, patients commonly pay for many 
supplies, even in state hospitals, including needles, bandages, and 
medicines.  The rise of an alternative system of private health 
services has aroused fears in some corners that these enterprises 
may someday replace state-sponsored health care entirely.  President 
Medvedev, speaking to World War II veterans on August 18, attempted 
to dispel that thinking: "Fears that medicine will be handed over to 
business are groundless.  That will not happen.  If private 
businesses want to invest in health care, they can set up their own 
private clinics.  But the state system of medical support will 
continue to exist has it has existed." 
 
¶3. (SBU) Several highly regarded private health clinics operate, but 
mostly in large cities such as Moscow and St. Petersburg.  The best 
known in Moscow are the European and American Health Centers, as 
well as the Center for Endoscopic Surgery and Kidney Stone 
Treatment, one of the oldest specialty private clinics, which opened 
in the early 1990s.  Many Russian patients consider the quality of 
care to be higher in private facilities.  However, a number of 
doctors told us that although facilities and equipment are often 
better at private health care centers, inpatient care is equal to or 
better in state centers.  Public institutions performing 
cardiosurgery and cancer treatment were singled out as superior to 
private counterparts.  Doctors consider Russia's inadequate medical 
education system to be a common barrier for all healthcare 
providers, public and private. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Russian health professionals see a variety of impediments 
to the development of widespread private health care.  According to 
one contact, the main obstacle is a lack of government regulation. 
Legislation has compelled the state healthcare oversight agency 
Roszdravnadzor to delegate its regulatory role in quality control to 
regional authorities over recent years, and regulatory resources are 
not yet sufficient in the regions to ensure adequate enforcement. 
Another contact from the Society for Evidence-Based Medicine more 
optimistically noted that if the constitution were implemented 
properly, private health care would develop over time as both 
government and private clinics attain equal access to insurance 
funds.  With a lack of legal enforcement, however, such development 
appears to be unlikely in the near future.  Another contact 
suggested that high property values in the big cities will 
eventually compel the government to sell off most of its state 
clinics to insurance companies to make way for private centers. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment:  Our limited survey of health practitioners and 
NGOs in Moscow suggests that private health care is available for 
those few who can afford it.  However, quality of care varies widely 
by specialty.  For the broader population, a system of private 
health care facilities with an integrated and functioning insurance 
network is a long way off.  Though some speculate that the 
government will be tempted to sell off state clinics in large cities 
to insurance companies as real estate prices soar, it is not clear 
if the legal framework for this exists.
