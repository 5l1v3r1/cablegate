SUBJECT: PANAMA: FARC REPORTEDLY LOOTS STORES IN THE DARIEN 

Classified By: PolCouns Brian Naranjo for Reasons 1.4 (d) 

¶1.  (C)  The Panamanian media reported August 3 that 60 armed 
men had entered the village of BajoChiquito (est. 200 
population) in the Darien Province and looted a store. They 
reported that local residents of the region, which is in the 
Embera-Wounaan Area Number 1, reported that there had been 
several similar actions in the area over the last several 
days. The newspapers reported speculation that the men were 
members of the FARC's 57th Front, and increased fear in the 
region, as a result of the reported threats by the group to 
return to the area again in the future. Official reaction has 
been muted and limited to noting that the Panamanian National 
Police (PNP) had sent reinforcements into the area. 
Commissioner Frank Abrego, head of the PNP's Frontier Unit 
was in the area investigating. All public GOP commentary on 
this incursion has refrained  from mentinoing the term 
"FARC," opting instead for the generic "criminal elements."
The papers reported up to 200 PNP men may have been sent to 
reinforce units in the region. Comment: BajoChiquito is over 
25 miles inside Panama.

¶2.  Post will report on any further developments.
