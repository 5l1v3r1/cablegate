After Musharraf 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (08/20) says: "...In 
the short term, it is expected that the165 million Pakistanis will 
realize that the country won with the end of the [Musharraf] 
government of almost a decade and, lately, devoid of legitimacy... 
While the Americans supplied the Pakistani military budget with 
declared resources in the amount of US$10 billion, part of which was 
transferred to support weakened public finances and, certainly, 
private banking accounts, Musharraf advanced seeking dictatorial 
power... Political stability in Pakistan is crucial in combating 
terrorism, among other reasons, because it is the only country with 
a Muslim majority that has nuclear arms.  Let's see how the 
architects of Musharraf's fall will behave - the former Premier 
Nawaz Sharif and Asif Zardani, the widow of Benazir Bhutto who now 
leads the major national party." 
 
The Mercosul Agenda 
 
Lead editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (08/20) 
comments: "To resume the negotiations for a trade agreement with 
European Union, held for four years, is the most ambitious item on 
the Brazilian [trade] agenda during its temporary presidency of 
Mercosul this term.... These negotiations will be the first 
important step of Mercosul since the failure of the Doha 
negotiations.  The first challenge will be to define the level of 
ambition for a trade agreement.  The Europeans will hardly offer 
more than they have offered in the multilateral round.  On the other 
side of the table, Mercosul members will, once again, face 
difficulties forming a consensus on concessions in the trade sector. 
...Everything will be much more difficult with the inclusion of 
Venezuela.  ... It makes no sense to have a partner that imposes 
conditions and demands changes in the bloc.  Mercosul will be an 
extra instrument for President Hugo Chavez to promote himself, 
thanks to another mistake in diplomacy by the Worker's Party."
