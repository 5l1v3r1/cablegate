¶1. (SBU) On August 19, we delivered Ref A demarche to Carlos 
Cordero at the MFA's Department of Disarmament, Terrorism and 
Organized Crime.  Cordero promised to follow the usual Costa 
Rican procedures of alerting Costa Rican intelligence and 
financial oversight agencies; however, since this is a 
national designation and not a UN designation, the GOCR's 
ability to act is more limited (Ref B).  He did appreciate, 
however, that the U.S. designations were aimed at fulfilling 
our obligations under UNSCRs 1747 and 1803.
