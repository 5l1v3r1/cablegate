Protests Require Approval 
------------------------- 
 
¶2. At the August 20 MFA press conference, spokesman Qin Gang 
reiterated that Public Security Bureau (PSB) approval is required to 
hold a protest in China.  Qin asked reporters if they were 
"disappointed" after reading the Xinhua report that none of the 77 
applications to protest in Beijing during the Olympics were approved 
because it was "not exciting."  Pro-Tibet independence protestors 
also must follow the law, Qin reminded the journalists, however 
anyone advocating "splitting China" would not be welcomed by the 
Chinese people.  Qin had no information on reports that two elderly 
women had been sentenced to reeducation through labor following 
repeated applications to protest. 
 
South Ossetia 
------------- 
 
¶3. China welcomes the recent cease fire agreement and troop 
withdrawal in the conflict between Russia and Georgia, said Qin. 
China hopes that the agreement will lead to a peaceful solution and 
ensure peace, stability and "normal life" in the region. 
 
Reported Detention of Suspected Pakistani Terrorists 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶4. The spokesman had no information regarding reports that 35 
Pakistanis had been detained as terror suspects by China. 
 
Dalai Lama in France 
-------------------- 
 
¶5. When asked to comment on the Dalai Lama's planned trip to France, 
Qin noted that China's position on the Dalai Lama is "clear cut and 
consistent."  China hopes that France will consider China's position 
and work with China to avoid any problems on the issue. 
 
Algerian Bombings 
----------------- 
 
¶6. Qin expressed China's condolences and sympathy to the victims of 
the suicide attacks in Algeria.  China "firmly opposes terror and 
supports the Algerian government's efforts to combat terror and 
safeguard stability." 
 
Reaction to Death of Zambian President 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. Asked for China's reaction to the death of Zambian president Levy 
Mwanawasa, Qin Gang lauded Mwanawasa's contributions to improving 
relations with China and said that China will never forget his 
accomplishments.  China wants to work with Zambia to develop further 
bilateral relations. 
 
Poisoned Dumplings 
------------------ 
 
¶8. Chinese authorities are still investigating the dumpling incident 
and details of the investigation should not be revealed before its 
conclusion, said Qin in response to a question regarding reports 
that China had asked Japan not to release information that "poisoned 
dumplings" have sickened Chinese citizens as well as Japanese. 
China attaches great importance to food safety not only for Japanese 
consumers but also Chinese consumers, said Qin.  China wants to 
continue to work with Japan on the issue.
