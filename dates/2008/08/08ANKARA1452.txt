(U) Sensitive but unclassified - please protect accordingly. 
 
¶1. (SBU) This is another in a series of weekly reports on PKK 
violence in Turkey.  Our primary source is the Turkish General Staff 
(TGS) website, which documents contacts and clashes with the PKK, as 
well as casualties incurred. 
 
¶2. (U) During the July 24-31, 2008 reporting period, five security 
officials were killed, including two in clashes and three by IED. 
Four security officials were injured, including three in clashes and 
one by an IED.   The total number of security force casualties for 
the year through July 31, 2008, was 63 killed and 98 injured. 
 
¶3. (U) During the same period, two PKK terrorists were killed in 
clashes.  Six PKKers were captured and three surrendered.  According 
to official TGS website figures, through the fourth week of July, 
the number of PKK militants killed this year was 554, the number of 
those captured was 118, and the number of those who surrendered was 
¶92. 
 
¶4. (U) The IEDs placed by the PKK claimed the lives of five 
civilians -- two in Lice, Diyarbakir Province on July 24, and three 
in Semdinli, Hakkari Province on July 27.  Three additional 
civilians were injured, including two by the IED in Lice, and one in 
clashes in Koyulhisar, Sivas Province on July 31.  The TGS website 
noted that one civilian was kidnapped for ransom by the PKK in Kigi, 
Bingol Province on July 24.  Meanwhile, the Ministry of Interior and 
the Istanbul Governor were quoted as blaming the PKK for two bomb 
explosions that left 17 people dead and 154 people injured in the 
Istanbul suburb of Gungoren on July 27.  Despite accusations from 
GOT officials, there was media speculation about who might actually 
have carried out these attacks, and the PKK denied responsibility. 
The total number of civilian casualties for the year through the end 
of the fourth week of July, including the Gungoren bombings, was 40 
killed, with another 225 wounded.
