¶1. (U) Summary: Consulate General Guangzhou has reviewed pandemic 
preparedness efforts based on guidance issued by the Department 
(reftel). Post's Emergency Action Committee meets regularly and 
reviews tripwires annually or as often as necessary if circumstances 
warrant.  Employees are strongly encouraged to maintain six-weeks 
worth of stay-in-place food and water supplies; post has also 
stocked emergency non-perishable food and medical supplies. 
American Citizens Services efforts to keep the local American 
community informed include handouts to all passport services 
customers, regularly updated information on post's website, online 
discussions and programs targeting the American school and U.S. 
businesses. End summary. 
 
------------------------ 
Continuity of Operations 
------------------------ 
 
¶2. (U) Pandemic planning is coordinated and reviewed by post's 
Emergency Action Committee (EAC).  The Consul General has designated 
the Consular Section Chief as the EAC Chair and Post's Emergency 
Preparedness Officer.  The EAC consists of representatives from each 
section and agency at Consulate General Guangzhou. 
 
¶3. (U) The EAC regularly holds emergency planning meetings and 
schedules avian influenza-specific meetings as needed. The EAC also 
annually reviews and assesses post tripwires and responses (or more 
frequently if circumstances warrant), and then updates the Emergency 
Action Plan (EAP). Post's tripwires were last reviewed on June 14, 
¶2008. 
 
¶4. (U) On July 15, EAC members participated in post's annual Crisis 
Management Exercise (CME), with a scenario based on an avian 
influenza outbreak.  On August 12, a follow-up meeting was held to 
review CME lessons-learned. 
 
------------------------ 
Cross-training Employees 
------------------------ 
 
¶5. (U) Post introduces pandemic planning to each employee upon 
arrival during the RSO in-brief.  To further increase preparedness 
in the Consulate community, post will hold a townhall meeting 
September 2008 to disseminate information on avian influenza and 
other related health concerns, post's pandemic planning and advice 
on establishing a household contingency plan.  Post will also 
produce and distribute a pamphlet containing key emergency 
information specific to pandemics.

Post Supplies 
------------- 
 
¶6. (U) Guangzhou's local water supply is not potable. Post maintains 
a limited supply of bottled water in-house.  In addition, the 
Consulate has access to neighboring White Swan Hotel's water tank. 
Post maintains a limited supply of emergency, non-perishable food in 
case sheltering-in-place is required.  However, we emphasize 
employee responsibility during a potential pandemic and the RSO 
strongly encourages employees to maintain at least six weeks-worth 
of stay-in-place food and water supplies per household. Post does 
not stockpile fuel.

¶7. (U) Post maintains fully stocked medical supplies at its Shamian 
Island location. Additional supplies are available at Post's China 
Hotel annex.  Post has the following supplies on hand: 
-- N-95 masks 
-- Sterile and non-sterile gloves 
-- Anti-viral medication (Tamiflu) 
-- Germicidal hand rinse 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Communication - American Citizen Awareness 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶8. (U) Maintaining an efficient and effective line of communication 
with Americans is a high priority.  Post makes every effort to keep 
U.S. citizens in south China abreast of ways in which they as 
individuals can prepare for a pandemic situation.  All passports 
that are handled in American Citizens Services (ACS) receive avian 
influenza informational inserts.  Basic information including warden 
messages, avian influenza virus and health information, and relevant 
resources, such as www.pandemicflu.gov, are located on Consulate 
General Guangzhou's website: 
http://guangzhou.usembassy-china.org.cn.   On August 18, Post hosted 
an online webchat addressing the topic of 'Emergency Preparedness,' 
which enabled Americans and local Chinese to submit real-time 
questions about how to safeguard themselves during a pandemic 
situation.  In addition to Post's online initiatives, citizens may 
also refer to the local health agencies and reputable local media 
outlets for up-to-date information. 
 
¶9. (U) Consular Affairs conducts outreach programs specifically 
targeting the American School's administrators and parents; this 
includes on-site information booths.   Post RSO conducts briefings 
for the local U.S. business community as part of the Overseas 
Security Advisory Council's (OSAC) programming. 
 
¶10. (U) As 'ground-zero' for H5N1 avian influenza and other 
infectious disease outbreaks, post appreciates the Department's 
emphasis on pandemic planning.  Guangzhou will continue to enhance 
post preparedness and community awareness, as well as strengthen 
cooperation with local government and health officials.
