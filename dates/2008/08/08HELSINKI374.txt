(SBU) Poloff delivered GAERC points to MFA Deputy Director 
Anu Laamanen on August 12.  Finnish representatives were en 
route to Brussels and Laamanen had obtained no position draft 
as yet.  She stated that Foreign Minister Stubb had met with 
Lavrov in the morning and that he had called Secretary Rice 
to give her a readout on the meeting. Sarkozy, Putin and 
Medvedev were in a closed door meeting at the time of the 
demarche and Laamanen awaited the results.  She stated that 
French Foreign Minister Kouchner and Stubb would brief EU 
ministers the following day.  Swedish FM Carl Bildt & Chair 
of Committee of Ministers, Council of Europe, would also 
recount his Tblisi trip.  Laamanen stated that the GoF is 
especially grateful for Stubb's access to the Secretary and 
other USG officials during the course of this crisis.
