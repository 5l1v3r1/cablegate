SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: BEIJING OLYMPICS 
 
Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies continued to focus 
August 14 news coverage on the Beijing Olympics and on President Ma 
Ying-jeou's transit stops in the United States Tuesday.  An 
editorial in the pro-independence, English-language "Taiwan News" 
discussed the Beijing Olympics and said U.S. President George W. 
Bush's statement made in Bangkok on cross-Strait situation "signals 
that Taiwan may well be slated to be used as a bargaining chip to 
realize 'peace in our times' with a rising authoritarian power." 
End summary. 
 
"Olympic Games Mask PRC Rights Crisis" 
 
The pro-independence, English-language "Taiwan News" [circulation: 
20,000] editorialized (8/14): 
 
"... However, the fact that PRC has fulfilled virtually none of its 
promises has not impeded world democratic leaders, such as United 
States President George W. Bush and French President Nichols 
Sarkozy, from eschewing calls by the global human rights community 
to refrain from attending the lavish opening spectacle.  Instead, 
fearful of offending this rising military and economic powerhouse, 
world leaders have had shown more enthusiasm to rush to Beijing to 
endorse the authoritarian CCP regime than attending the 2004 
Olympics in Greece, the birthplace of democracy. ...'' 
 
"The declaration by Bush in Bangkok on the eve of the Beijing 
Olympics that cooperation with the PRC had succeeded in 'ensuring 
peace in the Taiwan Strait' for the price of explicit opposition by 
Bush to 'Taiwan independence' signals that Taiwan may well be slated 
to be used as a bargaining chip to realize 'peace in our times' with 
a rising authoritarian power.  Only continued efforts by the world 
community in word and action to pressure Beijing to fulfill its 
human rights commitments and clear demonstration of the resolve of 
the 23 million Taiwan people to protect our democracy and autonomy 
can prevent the Beijing Olympics from following the example of the 
Berlin Games and becoming the prelude to a strengthening of 
authoritarianism in China and sentencing Taiwan to becoming another 
Czechoslovakia."
