SUBJECT: CASHIER CHECKING ACCOUNT 
 
REF: 05 CHARLESTON 01681 
 
¶1. In reftel, post cashier was authorized to establish a 
checking account valid until 08/31/08. Post requests that this 
authorization be extended to allow principal cashier, Muge 
Kocak, to continue using the checking account. 
 
¶2. Required information for cashier checking account:

        b. Cashier's name: Muge Kocak 
        c. Cashier code: TRB 
        d. Name of Bank: Fortis Bank 
        e. Purpose: Receive replenishment and make vendor payments. 
        f. Justification: Turnover time for receiving checks from 
Charleston typically takes up to 21 days,       which creates 
significant issues with Posts' paying vendors on time. In 
addition, the Consulate's       location outside of downtown Adana 
requires that the cashier's carrying checks to the downtown 
bank requires a physical security escort. 
 
¶3. Based on the justification above, Post requests 
re-authorization for Class B Cashier Muge Kocak to continue 
operating a cashier Checking account.
