¶3.  Negotiations Continuing...South African president Thabo Mbeki is 
expected in Harare August 9 or 10 to facilitate one-on-one talks 
between Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe and MDC president Morgan 
Tsvangirai.  The principal unresolved issue is the distribution of 
power between Mugabe as president and Tsvangirai as prime minister. 
Other issues include the transitional constitution, the size of 
cabinet and allocation of ministries, the future role of the 
security chiefs, and the nature and extent of amnesty.  If an 
agreement is reached, it is expected to be signed next week.  See 
Harare 661, 669, 674. 
 
¶4.  OFDA Director Visit...  USAID's Director of the Office of U.S. 
Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), Ky Luu, visited Harare, Zimbabwe 
July 29-31 to consult with humanitarian organizations, UN agencies, 
donor representatives, and Zimbabwean citizens regarding the crisis 
in the country.  The timing of his trip was particularly opportune, 
as Zimbabwe's humanitarian community has been operating under a 
restrictive and threatening environment in the post-March 29 
election period.  Luu's interactions and analysis led to a statement 
released by USAID Administrator Fore calling on the GOZ to rescind 
its ban on NGO field activities and create conditions suitable for 
humanitarian organizations to resume work safely and constructively. 
USAID is discussing a series of moves toward a strategic plan of 
action on the humanitarian situation.  See Harare 663, and for

¶5.  Price Controls Re-Imposed on Tourism...  In a hastily arranged 
meeting this week to explain the reintroduction of price controls in 
the tourism sector, the chairman of the National Incomes and Pricing 
Commission (NIPC), Goodwills Masimirembwa, accused players of 
profiteering through the use of the bank-transfer exchange rate 
rather than the agreed inter-bank rate in pricing products and 
services.  The President of the Zimbabwe Council for Tourism, Chipo 
Mutasa, expressed disappointment, highlighting the industry's 
position at the tail end of the value chain and its consequent 
inability to control costs.  Masimirembwa proposed a new system 
whereby players would apply individually for price increases so that 
the NIPC could identify "pockets of abuse" in the value chain. 
 
¶6.  Coins No Remedy for Cash Shortage... The reintroduction of coins 
that had been taken out of circulation in 2006, and the introduction 
of some new coins (highest denomination Z$2.5 billion old value), 
are likely to fuel the growth in money supply further--in the short 
term, at least.  We learned that the Reserve Bank provided Cargill 
with Z$100 quadrillion (old value) solely in coins this week to meet 
the company's cash purchases of cotton. 
 
¶7.  There is an apparent shortage of cash in the economy.  Most 
banks do not have enough resources and securities to enable them to 
get sufficient cash from the RBZ every day.  Unable to meet their 
customers' demand for cash, the banks still have long lines at their 
branches every day. 
 
¶8.  Scramble for Alternative Banknote Supplier...  Having lost its 
regular supplier of banknote paper and issued a new revalued 
currency in a hyperinflationary environment, the GOZ is scrambling 
to locate an alternate secure paper supplier.   See Harare 672. 
 
¶9.  "Homegrown Solutions" - the Fuel Couponization of Zimbabwe's 
Economy...  Already widely traded as a stable-even 
appreciating-shadow currency as the value of the local currency 
swoons, the GOZ approved use of BP and Caltex fuel coupons at an 
inaugural private "Auction by Barter" today where "executive 
vehicles," trucks and other vehicles will go under the hammer under 
the auctioneer's slogan "Tough Times - New Ideas!" 
 
¶10.  Corrigendum...  Last week's ZimNotes on the FEWSNet Executive 
Overview of Food Security should have read that Zimbabwe's national 
cereal deficit is "just over one million metric tons," not "just 
over one metric ton."

¶11.  August 1, 2008 The Herald: 
 
"The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has donated ... for the sitting judges 
(of the High Court)...16 top of the range Mercedes Benz E 280 ... 
32-inch plasma screen televisions and a full set of satellite dishes 
each .... Apart from the top-of-the-range Mercedes Benz, the judges 
also have utility vehicles which include Toyota IMV and Isuzu 
trucks, courtesy of the Central Bank.  (Master of the High Court) 
Mr. Nyatanga said it was not desirable for judges to drive Mercedes 
in rough terrain going to their farms."
