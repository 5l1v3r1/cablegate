SUBJECT: UNIFIL: PREVIOUSLY REQUESTED NOTIFICATIONS FOR VISITS

REF: BEIRUT 998; USUN 00732 
 
¶1.  (SBU) U.S. Embassy Beirut appreciates the efforts of USUN 
in bringing the issue of the suspicious incidents involving 
representatives of the Indian contingent of UNIFIL to the 
attention of the Asia and Middle East Director in the Office 
of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) detailed in reftel.  In a 
meeting on July 21, 2008, POL officers from USUN delivered a 
message to DPKO asking that "Prior to any appointment at the 
U.S. Embassy, UNIFIL members should send an e-mail to 
DRSOBeirut@state.gov stating the time, date, and vehicle 
information".  After a detailed review of existing consular 
and security procedures, post has determined that the 
information requested in that message can be obtained from 
alternate sources, and that rescinding this request will help 
avoid a double standard treatment of UN diplomatic personnel 
in Lebanon. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Based on above determination, U.S. Embassy Beirut 
requests that USUN contact DPKO to express the Embassy?s deep 
appreciation for its assistance in handling these incidents. 
Post would also like to inform the DPKO Middle East Director 
that the Embassy has developed alternate procedures in order 
to obtain the previously requested information, and that 
advance submissions of information regarding visits of UNIFIL 
personnel to the Embassy are no-longer necessary.
