SUBJECT:  ECUADORIAN COMMENTS ON 2009 SUMMIT OF THE AMERICAS DRAFT 
DECLARATION 
 
Ref.  State 84362 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Emboffs met with Emilio Izquierdo, Under Secretary for 
Multilateral Affairs at the Foreign Ministry, to seek an Ecuadorian 
reaction to the draft Summit of the Americas declaration, per 
reftel.  Izquierdo said the Government of Ecuador is still reviewing 
the draft declaration, but said that the initial reaction is 
positive and Ecuador did not have any concerns. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Izquierdo said that Ecuador is still defining its 
priorities for the Summit, but he thought that GOE attention would 
be most focused on environmental issues.  He added that he is 
hopeful that Ecuador would be able to bring additional resources to 
the Summit, probably for environmental issues, but that too is being 
discussed within the GOE.  (Note:  Izquierdo did not specify what 
type of resources, but we assume he meant financial or project 
support for certain environmental activities.)
