SUBJECT: RUSSIAN COMMENTS ON PREPARATIONS FOR NUCLEAR 
SUPPLIERS GROUP MEETING AUGUST 21-22 
 
REF: STATE 85948 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  On August 13, we met with MFA Department of 
Security and Disarmament Affairs Nuclear Issues Officer 
Alexander Bolychov to deliver reftel points regarding 
outreach activities prior to the NSG Plenary August 21-22. 
Bolychov reiterated Russia's support for the Nuclear 
Suppliers Group (NSG) waiver for India and told us that 
Russia is also actively reaching out to NSG-member countries, 
particularly China, members of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States (CIS) and smaller countries.  He also 
noted that Russia will address concerns expressed by Austria, 
Norway, Ireland and other countries regarding the waiver. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Bolychov mentioned two issues in paragraph 4 of 
the draft text that he thinks that NSG members could raise. 
First, the inclusion of the term "all non-member adherents" 
is a red flag because this issue has not yet been resolved. 
The second is the "confidentiality principle".  He made it 
clear that Russia will not/not raise either of these issues. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  After briefly discussing the draft, Bolychov asked 
if India had directly contributed to the wording of the draft 
waiver.  He said that if India were perceived to be too 
directly involved in the final document, it could give those 
not fully committed an additional issue to raise.
