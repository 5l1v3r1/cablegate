SUBJECT: ASEAN SECRETARIAT RAISES CONCERNS ABOUT CHARTER, ROLE 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary.  ASEAN Secretariat Principal Director for External 
Relations Dhannan Sunoto and his team raised concerns about growing 
political opposition to the ASEAN Charter in Thailand, Indonesia and 
the Philippines.  The Secretariat officials also expressed regret 
about ASEAN's limited role in easing border tensions between 
Thailand and Cambodia.  ASEAN member countries agreed in principle 
to hold an ASEAN Development Coordination Forum to advance the goals 
of the ASEAN Economic Community.  End Summary. 
 
Charter Ratification Concerns Grow 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) ASEAN Secretariat Principal Director for External Relations 
Dhannan Sunoto and his team raised concerns to the Embassy about 
growing political opposition to the ASEAN Charter in Thailand, 
Indonesia and the Philippines.  The ASEAN Charter establishes ASEAN 
as a legal entity and provides greater accountability for members to 
comply with ASEAN agreements.  The other seven members of ASEAN 
(Brunei, Burma, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam) 
have already ratified the Charter.  Secretariat officials noted that 
the Thai government is in a weak position to advocate for ASEAN 
Charter ratification in light of the strong criticism from 
opposition parties over the government's handling of the 
Thai-Cambodia border dispute.  In Indonesia, Secretariat officials 
worry that political opposition to the Charter will intensify in 
advance of the 2009 Presidential election.  Political efforts to tie 
Charter ratification to human rights issues in Burma could derail 
ratification in the Philippines, according to the officials. 
 
¶3. (SBU) ASEAN officials also expressed frustration that ASEAN had 
not been able to play a more meaningful role in easing border 
tensions between Thailand and Cambodia.  According to the officials, 
Thailand has consistently downplayed a role for ASEAN in the 
dispute, preferring to pursue a resolution on a bilateral basis. 
Thailand opposed the formation of an inter-regional group to address 
the dispute, according to the officials.  In addition, the officials 
noted that Cambodia prefers to raise the issue outside of ASEAN, 
fearing ASEAN would try to settle the matter internally without 
exposing problems to the broader international community. 
 
ASEAN to Host Development Forum 
------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) ASEAN member countries agreed in principle at their August 
Standing Committee Meeting to hold an ASEAN Development Coordination 
Forum, according to the ASEAN Secretariat.  The purpose of the Forum 
is to bring together member country representatives, ASEAN dialogue 
partners, and other interested organizations to form new 
partnerships and discuss actions needed to achieve the ASEAN 
Economic Community by 2015.  According to Secretariat officials, the 
Forum will take place in 2009, following the arrival of the ASEAN 
Member Country Permanent Representatives at the ASEAN Secretariat. 
The ASEAN Secretariat plans to host the Forum in Jakarta.
