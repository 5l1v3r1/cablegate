¶1. (U) Summary.  Consulate General Sao Paulo's Entry-level Committee 
(ELC) held a series of digital video conferences with bureaus in 
Washington, D.C. on mid-level job opportunities.  Participants 
described mid-level positions, key functions of each bureau, skills 
of successful candidates, and the expertise that employees gain in 
these positions.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) On August 20, Sao Paulo's ELC sponsored digital video 
conferences regarding mid-level job opportunities in Washington, 
D.C.  The Bureaus of Oceans, Environment and Science, Western 
Hemisphere Affairs, International Narcotics and Law Enforcement, and 
Intelligence and Research participated with Sao Paulo's fifteen 
ELOs.  Office directors and FS-03 officers explained mid-level 
positions in each bureau and how they choose among candidates.  They 
also described the skills FS-03 officers gain through these 
positions and which positions they choose afterwards.  Each bureau 
also gave the ELOs a better sense of how the regional and functional 
bureaus work within the Department. 
 
¶3. (U) Comment.  Most ELOs have not had the benefit of serving in 
Washington and do not have the opportunity to attend brown bag 
lunches and other recruiting events in the Department.  Sao Paulo's 
ELOs found that these video conferences effectively explained job 
options in Washington, D.C.  The ELOs also appreciated the in-depth 
explanations of how regional bureaus and inter-functional bureaus 
work together.  While second-tour officers immediately benefited 
from the conferences, first-tour officers found them useful in 
describing the skills that officers should acquire early for future 
success.  We strongly recommend that other posts take advantage of 
DVC technology as a way of getting information out to ELO bidders 
serving abroad.  Post greatly appreciates the assistance of OES, 
WHA, INL, and INR in this initiative.  End Comment.
