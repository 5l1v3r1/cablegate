SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. In July 2008, the Government of Nicaragua (GON) resolved six 
Embassy registered property claims.  Four claims were reported 
during the 2007-2008 waiver period (Refs A,B), while the remainder 
were resolved this waiver year.  The Property Office database now 
includes 624 unresolved registered property claims belonging to 297 
Amcits.  To date, most resolutions have involved compensation via 
government-issued indemnification bonds ("bonos de pago de 
indemnizacion" or BPIs).  As of July 31, 2008, the GON has issued 
BPIs with a face value of $328,975,518.06 to Embassy-registered 
claimants.  Since taking office in January 2007, the Ortega 
administration has resolved a total of 49 claims, two during the 
2008-2009 waiver year.
