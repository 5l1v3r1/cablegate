SUBJECT: CANADA UNLIKELY TO ATTEND DEVELOPMENT MINISTERS 
MEETING, MONROVIA, LIBERIA, SEPT. 5-6 
 
REF: SECSTATE 89825 
 
¶1. (U) On August 22, Econoff delivered reftel points to 
Jean-Yves Bourque, Program Officer, Canadian International 
Development Agency (CIDA).  Bourque stated that Canada does 
not have an aid program with Liberia and therefore is 
unlikely to attend the September Development Ministers 
meeting in Monrovia. 
 
¶2. (U) On August 27, Bourque confirmed that International 
Cooperation Minister Oda received an invitation to the 
conference.  He explained that the Minister has not yet 
decided if and on what level Canada might be represented. 
Bourque again said that because Canada has no aid program 
with Liberia, and does not want to artifically raise 
Liberia's hopes, it is extremely unlikely that Canada would 
send a high level representative to the meeting.  He said 
because of USG encouragement to attend the conference, Canada 
will consider sending an Abidjan-based development official.
