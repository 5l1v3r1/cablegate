REF: CARACAS 1081 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  On August 11, the Bolivarian Republic of 
Venezuela (BRV) freed prices for a number of price-controlled 
food products and raised maximum prices for several others. 
Press reports indicate the BRV has increased regulated food 
prices over thirty times since October 2007.  Although the 
most recent round of price increases of up to 110 percent 
will contribute to inflation, keeping food on the shelves is 
of greater concern to the BRV in the run-up to the November 
elections.  Many producers argue the increases are 
insufficient and will not boost domestic food output enough 
to satisfy growing consumer demand.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  In response to the increasing scarcity of several 
controlled price food products (reftel), on August 11 the BRV 
increased the regulated prices of eight basic food basket 
items and freed prices for seven others.  The price increases 
range from a one percent increase for pork chops to a 110 
percent increase for tomato sauce. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Although years of pressure by industry groups 
played a role in securing the price increases, industry 
insiders believe the most important factor in the BRV's 
decision was the need to keep food items popular with lower 
income groups on the table.  Several members of the VenAmcham 
Processed Food Products Committee told the Agriculture 
Attache on August 14 they are not surprised the BRV is taking 
action to reduce shortages ahead of the November elections, 
noting that the BRV considers food scarcity more damaging to 
its prospects in the November elections than inflation. 
 
¶4. (SBU)  The President of the Federation of Associations and 
Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Fedecamaras) told the 
press the most recent price increases, justified as the BRV's 
attempt to ensure supply, are yet another example of the 
failure of regulated prices to contain inflation.  According 
to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), average 
inflation in terms of food prices over the first five months 
of the year among 16 Latin American countries was 7.2 
percent, while in Venezuela the figure was 15.3 percent. 
 
¶5. (SBU)  Producer reaction to the price increases has varied 
by how close industry representatives are to officialdom. 
While "Bolivarian" producers have registered their approval 
of the price increases, the larger associations critical of 
the BRV argue the new prices do not cover the costs of 
production and will not sufficiently encourage domestic 
production.  Although shortages of eggs and milk became much 
less common when the BRV freed their prices, most producers 
are not optimistic the BRV will be willing to apply this 
lesson across the board.
