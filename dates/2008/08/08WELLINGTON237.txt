OUTCOME 
 
REF: STATE 81715 
 
¶1. Action Request - see paragraph 5. 
 
¶2.  In a press release issued Wednesday (7-30), NZ Trade 
Minister Goff said, "Despite substantial progress made across 
a range of issues taking us closer to agreement than the 
(DOHA) Round has ever been...differences of opinion between 
the U.S. and India over a safeguard mechanism to protect 
farmers in the developing world was unable to be resolved." 
Goff went on to say, "while all countries are obliged to 
pursue their legitimate national interests, it is equally 
important that each sees that no country's real interests are 
served by a failure to reach an outcome."  Trying to keep 
hope alive, he expounded further the same day in a radio 
interview (RadioNZ) saying, "it doesn't mean the round has 
failed but what it does mean is we won't achieve an outcome 
to the round this year, which was a realistic expectation at 
the start of the talks." Local press coverage has tried to 
express the concerns of both developing and developed 
nations' positions but the U.S. is featured as the developed 
country party unable to reach compromise with India and other 
developing countries seen as vulnerable to competition from 
large foreign producers. 
 
¶3.  On Thursday (7-31), Econoff spoke with Trade Minister 
Goff's Special Assistant, Catherine McIntosh (Goff en route 
from Geneva) and delivered the provided talking points 
(reftel) along with Ambassador Schwab's statement regarding 
Doha. Econoff stressed that it is neither helpful nor 
accurate to reduce the outcome solely to a disagreement 
between the U.S. and India as Goff,s statement yesterday 
appeared to do. 
 
¶4.  Econoff pointed out that some reportage like "The Press" 
newspaper (Christchurch) in an article published Thursday 
entitled "Free trade vital" attempted to better explain the 
complexity of the situation. Econoff drew her attention to 
the statement, "... they (China & India) were pitched not 
against the U.S. and EU...but rather against Latin American 
countries like Brazil & Uruguay which are seeking 
opportunities for their highly efficient agricultural 
exporters." While Econoff said that he recognized that this 
statement was not a definitive rendition of events but used 
it as an example of a more nuanced attempt to better explain 
the dynamic in Geneva. Econoff also pointed out that shadow 
Trade Spokesman Groser was quoted in the press as saying it's 
not helpful to try and lay blame but continue efforts to 
conclude the Round. Econoff said the Embassy would welcome 
the opportunity to discuss this further with the Minister 
when is back in office next Monday. 
 
¶5. ACTION REQUEST.  Embassy requests assistance from USTR, 
EEB and Public Affairs in developing or identifying materials 
to use with Minister Goff and to set the public record 
straight. One option might be an OpEd, which might better 
reflect events. Another possibility might be a DVC with 
journalists and government trade officials. Embassy 
appreciates any additional guidance on this topic.
