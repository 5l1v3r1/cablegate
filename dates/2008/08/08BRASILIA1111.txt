REF: A. SECSTATE 84362 
     ¶B. BRASILIA 1036 
 
¶1.  As per reftel, post discussed preparations for the April 
2009 Summit of the Americas with Brazilian Ministry of 
External Affairs Division of American States Deputy Director 
Antonio Franca.  Franca said that Brazil was still reviewing 
the draft declaration and would have specific comments later 
but was generally satisfied with the text.  Brazil's 
priorities will be energy security and social development 
(note: conversations on this subject during Amb. Morales' 
recent visit (ref b) indicate that the Brazilians may define 
energy security differently than the USG does, in that an 
important factor for the GOB is energy access).  Franca 
suggested that there would be a strong possibility for 
Brazil-U.S. cooperation on energy, particularly biofuels, and 
stated that it would be important for other hemispheric 
countries that benefit from greater access to biofuels to 
speak up in support.  According to Franca, Brazil will 
support the sub-theme of strengthening public security, but 
he cautioned that the declaration would have to be carefully 
worded because of Brazil's "legal distinction between 
security and defense." 
 
¶2.  Franca agreed that further coordination between the U.S. 
and Brazil will be useful.  His understanding is that each of 
the negotiating SIRGs will focus on one of the Summit themes, 
therefore he suggested an exchange of ideas two to three 
weeks proceeding each.  Post believes that such exchanges 
would be valuable and requests Washington agencies' input on 
the appropriate subject by the beginning of September to 
allow time to prepare for the September 18-19 SIRG.
