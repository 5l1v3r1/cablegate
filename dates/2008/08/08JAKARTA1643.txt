INFORMATION 
 
¶1. (U) This message is sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect 
accordingly. 
 
¶2. (SBU) According to WHO resident representative Dr. Subhash 
Salunke, Indonesia is reporting possible outbreaks of avian 
influenza to the WHO within 24 hours in compliance with the 
International Health Regulations.  Salunke confirmed to the Embassy 
that the WHO does not make public Indonesian avian influenza cases 
until the Ministry of Health announces them (roughly on a monthly 
basis). 
 
¶3. (SBU) When asked whether this delay in public announcement of 
cases lessened the ability of the world community to monitor 
potential outbreaks of avian influenza, Salunke said that the WHO 
studies the information provided by Indonesia carefully.  He added 
that if the WHO thought there were an international public health 
risk, it would make a public announcement with or without 
Indonesia's permission.  Salunke said that he was not pushing the 
Ministry of Health to allow it to make public cases immediately, 
noting that the WHO had already convinced Indonesia to announce its 
cases on a monthly rather than quarterly basis.
