SUBJECT: BEHIND THE (GEORGIA) CONFLICT, A FIGHT FOR OIL 
 
Liberal Folha de S. Paulo's correspondent Gilles Lapouge comments 
(08/27): "...The combat is clear: the Americans and Europeans try to 
ignore Russia and Iran by opening new ways for the oil to flow, over 
which Russia has no control.  But Moscow intends to maintain and 
resume the administration of Russian and Asian gas and oil to 
Europe.  In the confrontation between the West and Russia, Georgia 
is in a strategic position, which on one hand explains Western 
efforts for the countries in the Caucasus to make them a part of its 
economic-military devices... And, inversely, the risks assumed by 
the Kremlin to defeat Georgia and attract it to Russia's sphere of 
influence as well as the two Georgian separatist pro-Russian 
provinces of Abkazia and South Ossetia.  A difficult game of chess 
has started.  It is necessary to say however that the Russian player 
managed to block the Western player (the U.S. and EU).  Unless in 
the meeting called by Sarkozy a great idea comes forth."
