REF: A. STATE 88759 
     ¶B. TEL AVIV 1741 
 
¶1. Per reftel "A", on August 20 econoff transmitted the new 
list of designations to Roy Keidar, Legal Advisor to the 
Israeli National Security Council (NSC). Courtesy copies were 
also left with representatives of Mossad and with Yehuda 
Shaffer, Director of Israel's FIU, the Money Laundering and 
Terror Financing Prohibition Authority (IMPA). 
 
¶2.  The status of Israel's pending initiative to adopt a 
procedure that would allow it to come into compliance with 
UNSCR 1267 remains unchanged (see reftel "B"). Until the 
procedure is adopted and put into effect, Israel does not 
have the capacity to adopt into its own domestic law any 
designations by the USG or UN. The NSC continues to track 
these designations, however, and intends to retroactively 
adopt them once the new procedure is in place.
