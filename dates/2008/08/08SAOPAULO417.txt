Putting the Pieces Together After Doha 
 
Lead editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (08/01) says 
"The world is more dangerous for international trade with the 
collapse of the Doha Round.  The imposition of the law of the 
stronger [nations] will be much easier than it would be, in the 
coming years, if the negotiators had reached a modest agreement, but 
acceptable agreement for all. ... The evident risk, now, is the 
increase in subsidies, with the new U.S. Agricultural Law. ... 
Brazil will be one of the countries that will be harmed if these 
possibilities are confirmed, as it would have been one of the major 
winners, in case an agreement was reached. ... Meanwhile, only U.S. 
Trade Representative Susan Schwab has proposed a concrete proposal 
by suggesting a restart of the negotiations and establishing 
agreements on partial packages. ...The longer the negotiations are 
suspended, the more difficult it will be to put the pieces back 
together and even more improbable will be the ability to recuperate 
points agreed to up until now.  The change of administration in the 
U.S. and the European Union may create new priorities - and the new 
administrations probably will be more sensitive to protectionist's 
voices. ....The harm will especially large for the majority of the 
countries, if the loss of this effort results in a weakening of WTO 
and cracks in the multilateral system.
