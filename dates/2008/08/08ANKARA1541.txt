In Today's Papers 
 
Black Sea Tensions Steadily Rise 
Media continue to report on increasing tensions in the Black Sea and 
pay particular note to the presence of U.S. ships in the sea as 
Russia spurs tensions by recognizing South Ossetia and Abkahzia's 
independence.  Far right Ortadogu reports in "Tension's New Address 
- Poti," that the "Russians are now searching cargo ships that 
arrive in Poti," as, "additional U.S. ships are bound for Georgian 
ports."  Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak reports, "The USS Taylor 
passed through the straits to join Spanish, Polish, and German 
warships who are conducting military exercises in the Black Sea off 
the coast of Romania."  Can Atakli of mainstream Vatan criticizes 
the Turkish government for allowing the U.S. aid ships to pass 
through the Bosporus, "The U.S. humanitarian aid could have been 
taken to Georgia by the Turkish Navy," instead of by U.S. ships. 
Mustafa Balbay of leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet writes, "The new 
era in the Caucasus is a new tiff between the U.S. and Russia that 
will turn the entire region into another Middle East," as "Turkey is 
now dragged into the Caucasus crisis because it allowed the U.S. 
ships to pass through the straits."  Sami Kohen of mainstream 
Milliyet calls Russia's recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia 
"Russia's Kosovo revenge."  Liberal Radikal carries the headline, 
"The Russian Bear Shows Its Teeth to the West," by recognizing 
Abkhazia and South Ossetia's independence.  Mainstream Milliyet 
calls the Russian vote, "A Call for Division."  Islamist-oriented 
Zaman warns NATO, "Efforts to integrate Georgia into NATO before 
solving the problems in South Ossetia and Abkhazia could lead to a 
confrontation with Russia."  In addition, Zaman notes, "sanctions 
and pressure from the West will not make Russia bow to demands from 
the West," as the West is "dependent on Russian energy resources." 
 
Editorial Opinion on Montreux Treaty/Caucasus 
 
Murat Yetkin wrote in liberal Radikal: "A high-level Russian source 
from the Russian Embassy in Ankara expressed appreciation for 
Turkey's actions in accordance with the Montreux Treaty.  The source 
told me "Russia does not hold Turkey responsible for the current 
situation in the Black Sea.  Russia is concerned about the U.S. 
efforts to deliver humanitarian aid.  We don't understand why war 
ships were used instead of planes, which would be the easiest way to 
deliver the aid.  The Montreux Treaty should not be revised and 
everybody should fully respect its terms." 
 
Mustafa Balbay wrote in leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet: "The new era 
in the Caucasus is marked by a U.S.-Russia tiff that will turn the 
entire region into another Middle East.  Given Ankara's recent 
poorly coordinated efforts, there seems to be no working harmony 
between President Gul, Prime Minister Erdogan and the bureaucrats at 
the Foreign Ministry.  The MFA allowed American warships to pass 
through the Straits.  While Ankara believes one crisis was 
eliminated, in fact the passage of the ships mark the beginning of a 
larger crisis and Turkey is right in the middle of it.  Turkey hoped 
to be a part of a solution to the problem, but Turkey will likely 
end up being part of the crisis instead." 
 
Sami Kohen commented in mainstream Milliyet:  "The Russian 
parliament recognized the independence of the South Ossetia and 
Abkhazia.  It is obvious that Moscow wants to use this issue as a 
trump card against the Western community.  Russian support for South 
Ossetia and Abkhazia is not a new development.  Following the 
establishment of a pro-U.S. government in Georgia, Russia increased 
its economic and military support in both South Ossetia and 
Abkhazia.  Moreover, locals were issued Russia-issued passports. 
Earlier, Russia warned the western countries during Kosovo's 
independence discussions by saying "if Kosovo's independence is 
recognized, some day Moscow will recognize South Ossetia and 
Abkhazia's independence."  Thus, this last step Russia recognition 
of these two countries' independence can be seen as Russia's revenge 
for Kosovo."

Can Atakli noted in mainstream Vatan:  "There was no need to relax 
tonnage requirements under the Montreux treaty to allow the U.S. 
ships to pass through the straits.  The U.S. humanitarian aid could 
have been delivered to Georgia by the Turkish navy.  All the goods 
could have been transferred to Turkish ships in the Bosporus without 
sparking any problems.  Actually, U.S. civilian ships could also 
take the aid to Georgia without any problems.  None of these options 
were considered.  Instead, the Montreux rules were stretched and 
U.S. warships passed through the straits.  Whether it was 
intentional or not, Turkey is caught between Russia and the U.S. I 
really hope that this situation won't cause huge problems for 
Turkey." 
 
No Delays in Nuclear Tender 
Cumhuriyet, Milliyet, Yeni Safak, Radikal, and others:  Today's 
papers report that the Energy Ministry arranged a meeting with the 
companies participating in the tender process for Turkey's nuclear 
power plant.  Energy Minister Hilmi Guler said that there will be no 
delay on the bidding date for the tender, which is scheduled for 
September 24th.   Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet reports that four 
of these companies had requested postponement on the bidding date. 
 
 
Education Minister Celik Goes to Iran 
Mainstream Sabah reports that education Minister Huseyin Celik went 
to Iran today to visit his Iranian counterpart Alireza Ali Ahmedi. 
Van Mayor Burhan Yenigun and Van AKP deputy Kayhan Turkmenoglu will 
accompany Minister Celik.  The Ministry of Education issued a 
statement saying that Celik will have meetings "to improve the 
bilateral relations in the field of education, as well as to boost 
cultural cooperation between the Turkish and Iranian people." 
 
Iraqi PM Maliki says U.S. Troops will be out of Iraq by 2011 
Mainstream Milliyet cites a written statement from Iraqi Prime 
Minister Maliki's office disclosing that during a recent meeting 
with tribal leaders in Baghdad's Green Zone, Maliki said "Iraq 
reached an agreement with the coalition forces so there will be no 
presence of foreign troops in Iraq after 2011."  Milliyet notes that 
following Maliki's statement the White House issued a statement 
saying that a final agreement has not been finalized regarding a 
U.S. withdrawal. 
 
Editorial Commentary on AKP/Corruption Allegations: 
 
Oktay Eksi wrote in Hurriyet: "As one of the former AKP supporters 
emphasized, the AKP party founders originally suggested the creation 
of a system of financial transparency for all party members, but 
Erdogan never took a tangible legal step to implement this idea. 
Since the AKP came to power, no AKP politician has been investigated 
for corruption.  Turkey is ranked 64th among 180 countries in 
Transparency International's most recent corruption index, in 2006 
Turkey ranked four points higher.  PM Erdogan's so-called 'strong 
stance against corruption' is nothing but empty rhetoric."
