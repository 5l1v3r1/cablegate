¶1.  (U) This message was coordinated with Consulate Medan. 
 
¶2.  (U) SUMMARY:  A half dozen child and labor protection 
advocates in Medan in western Indonesia recently recounted to 
Labatt the extreme difficulties they face in saving child 
workers from unhealthy work conditions.  Sometimes when 
children are rescued from harsh labor conditions, the whole 
rescue effort is foiled when the children are then trafficked 
to other jobs, largely because their parents are powerless 
and poor.  The only solution is to provide sustainable 
education and other opportunities for children in order to 
help families cope with poverty, the child protection 
advocates said.  USDOL projects are helping in this effort. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
MEETING IN MEDAN 
 
¶3.  (U) Labatt recently reviewed trafficking-related issues 
during a stop in Medan in North Sumatra.  A half dozen child 
and labor protection advocates in Medan recounted to Labatt 
the extreme difficulties they face in saving child workers 
from unhealthy work conditions.  Trapped in an environment 
where parents expect and need children to work in order to 
make ends meet--exacerbated by the families' inability to pay 
school fees--many children work long hours in unhealthy 
conditions.   Public education is free through grade eight 
under Indonesian law but fees are charged for high school. 
Many elementary and junior high schools charge fees despite 
the law.  Unofficial fees can be as high as USD 170 a 
semester, several months' salary for poor families.  The 
situation in Medan is a microcosm of conditions nationwide 
(Ref C). 
 
TO WORK OR TO BE TRAFFICKED 
 
¶4.  (U) In the past, North Sumatran NGOs have reported child 
labor activity to police, only to see the children sometimes 
fired from their jobs and trafficked, child welfare advocates 
told Labatt.  The same employers later hire other children. 
Traffickers prey on children who are desperate for income and 
accustomed to working.  Oktoviana (one name only), head of 
the influential child advocacy NGO Yayasan Pondok Rakyat 
Kreatif (YPRK), said she has been working for nearly 20 years 
to stop child labor in the local shrimp packaging industry 
(Ref B) but has yet to arrive at a solution which will 
protect children's welfare.  Children in these factories rise 
at dawn to be bused to work and do not get to bed until 
around midnight.  These conditions are classified as the 
worst forms of child labor because of the long hours and the 
fact the children have no opportunity to pursue any kind of 
education. 
 
¶5.  (U) The only solution is to provide educational and job 
training opportunities for children, to help families cope 
with poverty, and to educate parents of the dangers of child 
labor and trafficking, child protection advocates said.  The 
U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) funds many projects 
nationwide, which have succeeded in keeping children in 
school by defraying costs of education, providing vocational 
education and educating communities on the harm caused to 
children who forego education in order to work (Ref A).  A 
commonly held perception in poor Indonesian communities is 
that child labor is positive because the children are helping 
their families. 
 
¶6.  (U) Another obstacle in rescuing child workers in North 
Sumatra and elsewhere--mostly aged 15-17 but some under age 
15--is the fact that they have false documents raising their 
ages and that they conspire with employers to lie about their

age.   Sometimes local officials in Indonesia readily comply 
by issuing false documents which allow children to work. 
 
WORKING TO TACKLE THE PROBLEM 
 
¶7.  (U) Over all, the child protection advocates painted a 
picture of an ongoing problem, which the GOI is working to 
deal with.  USG programs to prevent child labor are leading 
the way to find solutions.   The GOI will need to make huge 
investments in education to help overcome this problem. 
Still, the GOI is increasingly addressing child employment 
through innovative education programs, following the models 
of USG-funded projects, such as those sponsored by USDOL. 
Political awareness of the child labor problem has greatly 
increased in recent years largely because of these USG 
efforts.
