Article by Marcelo de Paiva Abreu, professor at the School of 
Economics in PUC Rio de Janeiro (Catholic University), in 
center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (08/25) says: "Last week's 
happenings in Ossetia, Abkhazia and Georgia explained important 
changes in the global political balance.  For the first time, since 
the fall of communism, it is evident that there are concrete limits 
to the U.S. strategy based on the utilization of the U.S. economic 
and military forces. ... It was clearly evident the resurgence of 
Russian military power.  But, more importantly it was the evidence 
that the U.S. did not have the right conditions to go further than 
offering moral comfort to Saakashvili and from a military point of 
view, nothing could be done to avoid a Georgian humiliation. The 
imprudence of the U.S. strategy was painfully evident and North 
American frustration with its own incompetence was so huge that the 
government easily convinced itself that everything could be 
explained away by Russian bad faith...."
