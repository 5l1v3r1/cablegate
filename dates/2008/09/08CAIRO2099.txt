We delivered points in reftel to MFA Deputy Director for 
Palestinian Affairs Barakat Leithy on September 25 (senior 
MFA interlocutors on Israel-Palestinian issues are currently 
in New York with the Egyptian delegation to the United 
Nations General Assembly).  Leithy took our points but was 
non-committal.  He promised to convey our position to the 
Egyptian delegation in New York immediately.
