SUBJECT: GUIDANCE FOR UNSC CONSULTATIONS ON ZIMBABWE 
SEPTEMBER 19 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request.  USUN should draw from the 
points in para 2 during the UN Security Council consultations 
on Zimbabwe September 19. 
 
¶2. (U) Begin points: 
 
     I would like to thank Assistant Secretary General for 
Political Affairs Haile Menkerios for his briefing on the 
situation in Zimbabwe. Today, I would like to make three 
points. 
 
     First, the United States notes that the agreement 
signed by the parties on September 15 provides an opportunity 
to put Zimbabwe on the path to democratic reform and economic 
prosperity.  We are cautiously optimistic that it will give 
greater voice to the aspirations and will of the Zimbabwean 
people, as expressed on March 29.  If implemented, the 
agreement offers the people of Zimbabwe a chance to live in 
peace without fear of violence and intimidation. 
Furthermore, the agreement notes the State,s responsibility 
to ensure that all Zimbabweans have access to humanitarian 
and food assistance.  The true test of the agreement will be 
in its implementation. 
 
     Second, the United States remains concerned about the 
welfare of the Zimbabwean people given reports of incidents 
of government-sanctioned violence and intimidation in some 
areas of the country.  There are reports that so-called war 
veterans and youth "militia" -- previously organized and 
funded by the government -- have not been disbanded and 
continue to assault and harass segments of the population. 
 
     Third, although we are encouraged by the government,s 
decision to lift the suspension on the operations of 
organizations providing humanitarian assistance, we remain 
seriously concerned by reports that democratic governance and 
human rights organizations may still face significant 
challenges to their operations.  We hope that under the new 
government, civil society will be able to operate freely so 
that Zimbabweans can safely exercise their political rights. 
We are also concerned that the imposition of certain 
reporting and monitoring requirements on humanitarian 
organizations could potentially obstruct much needed food and 
medical assistance programs.  As part of our commitment to 
help the people of Zimbabwe in their time of greatest need, 
we have provided over $170 million in food aid and other 
support inside Zimbabwe.  In addition, we have provided $2.5 
million for refugees and asylum seekers in neighboring 
countries. 
 
     We strongly encourage the commitment of all parties to 
begin concrete steps to implement the agreement signed on 
September 15, so that the Zimbabwean people can experience 
relief, begin recovery, and continue on the path to 
democratic reform. 
 
. Lastly, we thank UN Assistant Secretary General for 
Political Affairs Haile Menkerios for keeping the Council 
informed of developments in Zimbabwe.
