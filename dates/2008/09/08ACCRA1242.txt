SUBJECT: GHANAQS FINANCE MINISTER DEAD 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Ghanaian media is reporting that Ghana's 
Minister of Finance and Economic Planning, Kwadwo 
Baah-Wiredu, has passed away in South Africa.  Baah- 
Wiredu, one of President Kufour's most popular 
ministers, was in South Africa for medical treatment 
for an undisclosed illness since last week.  The 
government has yet to react officially to the death, 
but Ambassador Teitelbaum expressed his condolences 
during a call on Vice President Mahama on the 
afternoon of August 24.  Baah-Wiredu was 57 years 
old and has held different Cabinet portfolios 
continuously since 2001. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The popular Finance Minister's death is an 
unwelcome development for the Ghanaian government. 
The effect on the governing partyQs presidential 
campaign is unclear, but likely minimal. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Contacts in the ministry confirmed that Dr. 
Anthony Akoto Osei, the current Minister of State, 
would be the leading candidate to replace Baah- 
Wiredu if a caretaker is named for the remaining 
three months of the administration.    Dr. Osei is 
already heavily involved in the day-to-day running 
of the ministry.  However, they stressed that the 
government has not made a decision on whether to 
fill the void.  None of our contacts expect a change 
of course in economic or financial policy due to 
Baah-Wiredu's death.
