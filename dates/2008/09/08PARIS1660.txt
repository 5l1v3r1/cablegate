¶2.  (SBU) On September 2 we conveyed reftel demarche in 
support of the expansion of the Afghan National Army from 
86,000 to 134,000 at the September 10 Joint Coordination 
Board Meeting in Kabul to Nicolas Niemtchinow, DAS-equivalent 
in the bureau of Strategic Affairs at the MFA.  Niemtchinow 
responded that the GOF takes the subject of supporting the 
Afghan National Army (ANA) very seriously and that the 
training and increased capabilities of ANA is both a priority 
and a key element of our common engagement in Afghanistan. 
The GOF is considering what else they can do to support the 
ANA, aside from their current investment in training via 
OMLTs.  Niemtchinow promised to keep us informed as events 
progress and assured us in the meantime of France's support.
