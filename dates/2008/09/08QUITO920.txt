SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR HODGES' FIRST TRIP IN ECUADOR HIGHLIGHTS BREADTH 
OF U.S. ECONOMIC AID 
 
¶1.  (U) Summary: On September 3-4, the Ambassador traveled to the 
provinces of Tungurahua and Cotopaxi in central Ecuador.  Ambassador 
Hodges delivered her first speech in Ambato, the largest city in 
Ecuador's central Sierra, and used several other events to showcase 
the range of USG economic support for this region.  The trip 
attracted significant press coverage, and the Ambassador was warmly 
received at every stop.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (U) By choosing Ambato, the capital of Tungurahua, for her first 
trip, the Ambassador emphasized U.S. connections to ordinary 
Ecuadorians.  The Ambassador's first public speech was before CEDET, 
a national grouping of regional private-public development agencies 
that seek, with USAID support, to create a positive business climate 
in Ecuador.  The press coverage noted the speech's focus on the 
long-standing close relationship between the U.S. and Ecuador and 
the breadth of ongoing cooperation. 
 
¶3.  (U) The Ambassador visited a series of projects in the region 
supported by USAID and USDA's PL-480 program, accompanied by media 
coverage to highlight the extent of U.S. support for regional 
development projects.  She also visited Ecuador's largest broccoli 
exporter and a large flower farm, two labor-intensive businesses 
that benefit under the Andean Trade Preferences Act and highlight 
Ecuador's ability to develop new export products. 
 
¶4.  (U) Comment:  In a quick visit to Ecuador's central Sierra 
region, the Ambassador was able to highlight the breadth and depth 
of our cooperation with Ecuador, the USG's ability to deliver 
projects that help ordinary Ecuadorians throughout the country, and 
the benefits of working with the private sector through trade-based 
programs to create good jobs for Ecuadorians.
