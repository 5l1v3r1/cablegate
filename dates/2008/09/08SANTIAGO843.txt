ISSUE 
 
REF: A. STATE 96677 
     ¶B. SANTIAGO 779 
 
Classified By: Acting Pol/Econ Chief Tim Stater for reason 1.4 (b). 
 
¶1.  (C) Poloff delivered Ref A demarche to Eduardo Schott, 
MFA Deputy Director for European Affairs, on September 15. 
Schott reiterated the position he elaborated on August 
27--Chile has no plans to recognize either South Ossetia or 
Abkhazia (Ref B).  Schott was unconcerned by Nicaragua's 
recognition of the two regions, saying that Nicaragua was 
isolated in its action but had the right to make its own 
foreign policy decisions.  He maintained that Nicaragua's 
action would have little bearing on decisions by other Latin 
American countries as to whether or not to recognize Abkhazia 
and South Ossetia, and that Cuba and Venezuela were the only 
countries in the region he thought might extend recognition. 
Given this assessment, Schott thought it was unnecessary for 
Chile to publicly express concern over the action or discuss 
it with Nicaragua.  Finally, Schott added that the current 
crisis in Bolivia is the central concern of the region, so 
that other Latin American countries are distracted from 
events in the Republic of Georgia. 
 
¶2.  (C) Schott went on to say that it was no surprise that 
Kosovo's independence was being used to justify other 
independence movements.  Concerns that recognizing Kosovar 
integrity would lead to additional bids for independence were 
a central factor in Chile's decision not to recognize Kosovo, 
he said.  Schott acknowledged Poloff's points that Kosovo was 
a categorically different situation given the UN-sanctioned 
international administration and security guarantees, but 
said that nonetheless the situations were similar enough that 
some actors could claim--justifiably or not--a Kosovo 
precedent.
