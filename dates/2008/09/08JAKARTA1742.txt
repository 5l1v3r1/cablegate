REF: JAKARTA 1676 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On September 15, poloff delivered to the Indonesian 
Department of Foreign Affairs (DEPLU) the Department of 
Justice (DOJ) memorandum on the Application the Law of 
Foreign State Immunity: Sarmili v. World Health Organization 
and United States of America and the letter addressed to the 
court summarizing the attached memorandum under cover of 
diplomatic note.  The letter and memorandum, explaining the 
basis for sovereign immunity in international law, were 
delivered in English and Indonesian.  Emboffs subsequently 
received confirmation that all documentation had been 
delivered to the court. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) During the delivery of the letter and memorandum to 
DEPLU, Emboffs met with Arif Havas Oegroseno, Director of 
DEPLU's Office of Political, Legal and Regional Treaties, and 
his assistant, Cahyo Muzhar.  Muzhar said that he was 
drafting the legal opinion from DEPLU to submit along with 
the USG documents to the court.  He reiterated that Oegroseno 
had discussed the case with the court and believes he made 
progress with the judges. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Oegroseno and Muzhar recommended that neither the 
USG nor its agent appear at the September 17 proceedings. 
Muzhar stated that he might send a member of DEPLU,s staff 
to monitor the proceedings. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Muzhar also stated that DEPLU considers the summons 
dated June 12, 2008, to be the second summons rather than the 
third summons.  If the court agrees that the June 12 summons 
is the second summons, there may be a third summons for a 
court date in November.  Muzhar elaborated that the plaintiff 
seemed reluctant to pay the court fees for the delivery of 
the third summons.  He indicated that if the court required 
an expert witness to testify on Foreign Sate Immunity, 
DEPLU's Arif Havas Oegroseno would consider serving as the 
expert witness.
