REF: STATE 89919 
 
¶1. (U) Summary:  Diagnost representatives told us they plan to 
purchase the reftel item to use as a demonstration model for 
prospective customers, including Zenit.  Diagnost was established in 
1991 and the five original owners still run the company.  Diagnost 
operates as a broker of monitoring and control equipment, purchasing 
goods from the U.S. and Europe and selling them to companies located 
mostly in the Russian Federation.  These companies include steel 
mills and aluminum plants, among others.  The only role Zenit will 
play in this transaction is that of potential customer.  Post 
verified the bona fides of Diagnost and recommends it as a reliable 
end-user of United States Munitions List (USML) items.  End Summary. 
 
 
¶2. (U) In a September 11 meeting, Diagnost Director Aleksandr Kozlov 
and Sales Manager Dmitriy Cheredeyev told us their company has been 
in business since 1991.  They are co-owners of the company, along 
with Mikhail Petrevshenkov, Aleksandr Sergeyev, and Gennadiy 
Yasinovskiy.  Diagnost is a limited-liability corporation. 
 
¶3. (U) Diagnost operates as a broker of monitoring and control 
equipment.  It imports equipment from U.S. companies such as Mikron 
and European companies such as Chauvin-Arnoux of France and Ion 
Science Innovation of the United Kingdom.  It deals in items such as 
infrared radiometric cameras, ultrasonic sensors, electronic 
measuring devices, and the like.  Diagnost's customers typically 
include steel mills, aluminum plants, oil and gas companies, and 
power stations all over Russia, as well as in Ukraine, Belarus and 
Kazakhstan. 
 
¶4. (U) Diagnost does possess supporting documentation, including 
purchase orders, for this transaction.  Diagnost plans to use this 
Hotshot HD-XT Predictive Maintenance Camera System (FLIR) strictly 
as a demonstration model to show to potential customers.  If the 
customers would like to buy the item, Diagnost would then order 
another example of the item from Electrophysics Corp. and sell it to 
the customer.  Diagnost does not own a large warehouse or storage 
facility.  Instead, it purchases items from foreign sellers only 
after it has an order from a customer.  Goods waiting for 
distribution are kept in the company's office, which is located 
inside a guarded building. 
 
¶5. (U) Zenit was listed on the Blue Lantern application simply as a 
potential customer.  Diagnost plans to show the item to Zenit; Zenit 
will not actually use the item listed on the reftel application. 
 
¶6. (U) Diagnost understands the restrictions on USML items, 
especially the prohibition against unauthorized re-transfers and 
re-exports.  Post verified the bona fides of Diagnost and recommends 
it as a reliable end-user of USML items.
