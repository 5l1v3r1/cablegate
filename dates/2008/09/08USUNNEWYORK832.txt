DEMONSTRATIONS 
 
¶1.  This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 4 below. 
 
¶2.  USUN has received a diplomatic note from the Iranian 
Mission to the UN complaining that demonstrators linked to a 
terrorist group have been allowed to demonstrate in New York, 
 The note requests the USG prevent further demonstrations. 
Text of the note follows in paragraph 3 below. 
 
¶3.  Begin text of Iranian note no. 214 of September 12, 2008: 
 (Complimentary salutation)... and has the honor to state the 
following: 
On 12 September 2008, dozens of members and supporters of the 
terrorist group, Mujahedin Khalgh Organization (MKO), 
demonstrated in front of the United Nations Headquarters in 
New York against the Islamic Republic of Iran.  The 
demonstrators carried the flag and the emblem of the 
notorious organization and the pictures of its infamous 
leaders with them.  We have learned that they intend to carry 
out more demonstrations in coming days. 
Giving permit (sic) to the supporters and members of a 
terrorist group - which is also designated by the United 
States as a terrorist group - to stage demonstrations and 
propagate its evil cause amounts to legitimizing terrorism. 
The United States is bound by its international obligations 
to refrain from providing any form of support to the members 
and supporters of the MKO terrorist groups.  It is expected 
that necessary measures will be taken by the United States 
authorities to ban this terrorist group and prevent public 
demonstrations by its members and supporters. 
(Complimentary close).  End text 
 
¶4.  The New York City Police Department has informed USUN 
that "the Association of Iranian-Americans in New York" were 
the sponsors of the September 12 demonstration.  This group 
plans to continue to demonstrate across the street from the 
UN through the 19th of September, and then will hold a larger 
rally (up to 500 people) at an alternate site on September 23 
when as many as 120 heads of state and government will be in 
town.  The NYPD says it has never experienced problems with 
this group and intends to permit the demonstrations while 
monitoring them to make sure they do not spin out of control. 
 USUN requests that the Department provide guidance for a 
reply to the Iranian Mission.
