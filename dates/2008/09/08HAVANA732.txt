HURRICANE IKE UPDATE 
 
¶1. Post's Emergency Action Committee (EAC) met at noon today to 
discuss the current status of Hurricane Ike and the impact to UNINT 
operations. 
 
¶2. As of 11:00 a.m. Sunday, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) 
reported no change in the status of Hurricane Ike.  It remains a 
Category Four (4) storm and should make landfall near Holguin 
Province, Cuba on Sunday evening.  The NHC further reported that 
rain should begin falling from the outer bands in Havana on Monday 
afternoon with full force winds arriving circa 2300 hours, Monday 
evening.  The eye of the storm is projected to pass over Havana at 
approximately 0800 hours, Tuesday, September 9th.  At present, the 
NHC projects a likely storm surge along the northern coast of 7-10 
feet given Ike's current path but added that any deviation north or 
south will alter their projection.  If the storm continues over 
land, it's strength should diminish to a Category One (1) hurricane 
by the time it reaches Havana. 
 
¶3.  Post Operations:  USINT EAC decided to close the Section at 1400 
hours on Monday and remain closed to the public through Tuesday 
pending a post-storm review of local conditions.  Visa and refugee 
interviews will be cancelled on Wednesday, as well.  Facility and 
residential preparations are in full swing and will be completed by 
Monday afternoon. 
 
¶4.  The EAC also decided to seek authorized departure approval from 
the Department as one family has requested permission to leave the 
island in advance of the storm.  Post management is drafting that 
request septel, and will advise USINT personnel that they have this 
option if the Department approves the authorized departure request. 
USINT residents living in lower-lying areas of Havana also have been 
given the option to relocate to either an approved hotel or Post 
housing in a non-flood zone. 
 
¶5.  The USINT Consular Section is revising their warden message and 
contacting wardens via telephone and/or email regarding Ike's 
projected effects and the request for authorized departure.  Post 
believes that the impact on American Citizen Services operations 
will not be significant. 
 
¶6.  The International School of Havana (ISH) anticipates that Monday 
will be a regular school day but added that they will reassess their 
schedule based on the storm's path.  (NOTE:  Fifteen USINT family 
members attend ISH.) 
 
¶7.  USINT will upgrade Post's website with information related to 
Tuesday and Wednesday's closure, and the warden message/travel 
advisory on Monday.
