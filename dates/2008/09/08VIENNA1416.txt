¶1. (U) Polchief discussed reftel points September 25 with 
Stefan Weidinger, MFA unit chief for Development Cooperation 
in Southeastern and Eastern Europe.  Weidinger noted that the 
Southern Caucasus, including Georgia, is one of the MFA's 
seven priority regions for assistance worldwide.  He said 
that at the October donor conference Austria will report that 
it plans to spend between a minimum of 550,000 euros and a 
maximum of 1.5 million euros in bilateral technical 
assistance for the Southern Caucasus for 2009.  About 40 
percent of this amount would be for Georgia.  Austria 
provided Georgia with 1.3 million euros in bilateral 
technical assistance in 2008.  Following the conflict with 
Russia, the GOA provided Georgia with 350,000 euros in 
emergency assistance, primarily for UNICEF projects to 
protect civilians against mines, he said. 
 
¶2. (U) In addition to the bilateral technical assistance, the 
GOA is considering funding small humanitarian projects in 
Georgia focused on the civil service, rule of law, and youth, 
Weidinger said.  The GOA will contribute 2.6 percent of any 
EU or European Commission assistance provided to Georgia, he 
said.
