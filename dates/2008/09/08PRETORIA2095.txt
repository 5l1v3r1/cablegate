SUBJECT: ANC NATIONAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE STATEMENT 
RECALLING MBEKI 
 
¶1.  On 21 September, The National Executive Council (NEC) of 
the ruling African National Congress (ANC) announced that 
President Thabo Mbeki was told to step down, which he did the 
following day.  In explanation of this decision, ANC 
Secretary Gwede Mantashe said the ANC admired Mbeki's many 
years of service and accomplishment.  However, in response to 
press questions, he explained that the two centers of power 
problem in the ANC had to be resolved, and that the prospect 
of the NPA reopening the corruption trial against ANC 
President Zuma precipitated this decision as Zuma supporters 
believe Mbeki was leading a political conspiracy to persecute 
and prosecute Zuma. 
 
¶2.  Text of ANC National Executive Committee Statement. 
 
20 September 2008 
 
Over the past two days, the National Executive Committee of 
the ANC has deliberated on the Pietermaritzburg decision by 
Judge Chris Nicholson. 
 
In particular, we have focused on the implications of the 
judgement for our movement, and for our people as a whole. 
 
The judgement has had a profound impact on many aspects of 
our legal system. It has obviously also had an impact on the 
affairs of the ANC. 
 
We wish to assert to you that our most important task as a 
revolutionary movement is the stability of our country and 
the unity and cohesion of the ANC. Our movement has been 
through a trying period and we are determined to heal the 
rifts that may exist. 
 
In the light of this, and after a long and difficult 
discussion, the ANC has decided to recall the President of 
the Republic before his term of office expires. 
 
Our decision has been communicated to him. 
 
The formalities are now subject of a Parliamentary process 
and, we can assure you, will take place in a way which 
ensures smooth running of government. 
 
We acknowledge with deep admiration all the great strides our 
country has made under the stewardship of President Mbeki. He 
remains a loyal cadre of our movement and we will continue to 
work closely with him on matters relating to our desire to 
achieve a developmental state. 
 
We will follow with precision all the constitutional 
requirements to ensure that interim arrangements are in place 
to ensure the smooth running of the government. 
 
In the coming days, the President of the ANC will meet with 
ANC deployees in government to assure them that the NEC would 
wish for them toremain in Government. 
 
To the citizens of South Africa, we make the commitment that 
we share their desire for stability and for a peaceful and 
prosperous South Africa. We believe that our decision is in 
the interests of making that a secure reality. 
 
Issued: African National Congress
