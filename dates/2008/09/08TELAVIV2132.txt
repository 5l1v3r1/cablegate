Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
This morning Maariv and the electronic media reported that FM Tzipi 
Livni defeated Transportation Minister Shaul Mofaz by 431 votes in 
the Kadima primaries (43.1% - 16963 votes to 42% - 16555 votes). 
Interior Minister Meir Sheetrit got 8.5% of the votes; and 6.5% went 
to Internal Security Minister Avi Dichter.  Last night exit polls by 
TV stations had forecast that Livni would win by 10-12%. 
Commentators called this discrepancy the "Yom Kippur of the polls" 
(after the Yom Kippur War).  The media reported that Livni would 
have to choose between forming a coalition -- she has up to 42 days 
to do so -- and calling for new elections.  Shas and Labor Party 
officials cast doubt on her ability to form a government.  IDF Radio 
reported that Labor prefers to remain in the coalition, in an 
attempt to avoid general elections. 
 
Israel Radio quoted Livni as saying after the publication of the 
results that she will begin her meetings with Knesset faction 
members to establish a coalition as soon as possible, and that she 
would take action to unite Kadima.  Livni was quoted as saying that 
her rivals were rivals of the moment, and that now they would set 
out on the road together.  She stressed that the national mission 
she faces is to promote government stability and eliminate 
uncertainty.  She thanked her supporters and said that the hope that 
they had placed in her will enable her to treat the post of Kadima 
chairman and prime minister of Israel as sacred.  Livni said that 
Kadima proved today that there is another type of politics. 
 
Ha'aretz reported that PM Ehud Olmert will inform the cabinet of his 
resignation on Sunday. 
 
Yediot reported that yesterday the new ambassadors of Egypt and the 
U.S. presented their credentials to President Shimon Peres. 
 
Leading media reported that the PM's point man on prisoner 
exchanges, Ofer Dekel, left yesterday for Egypt, and that he 
expected to present the Egyptian government with new, more flexible 
ideas on negotiations with Hamas.  Yediot reported that yesterday, 
despite objections by Gilad Shalit's family, the GOI transferred 50 
million shekels (around $24 million) to the PA in Gaza. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that a fifth round of indirect 
Israeli-Syrian talks in Turkey that were expected to take place 
tomorrow and Friday have been postponed, but neither Israeli nor 
Turkish sources confirmed remarks made yesterday by Syrian FM Walid 
Muallem that Israel asked for the delay. 
 
Major media reported that in two days of trading, Israel's five 
biggest banks lost 7 billion shekels (around $1.972 billion) in 
value.  Since the start of the year the banks have lost 24 billion 
shekels (around $6.76 billion) from their combined market 
capitalization on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange -- 40% of their value. 
Ha'aretz reported that yesterday, in a meeting with Bank of Israel 
Governor Stanley Fischer and Banks Supervisor Rony Hizkiyahu, the 
managing directors of the seven largest banks in Israel reported 
that exposure of commercial banks to the collapse of U.S. investment 
banking giant Lehman Brothers is limited.  The banking system has 
taken steps to protect itself from the effects of the financial 
crisis in the U.S., they said.  Ha'aretz reported that from the 
start of 2008 the index of Israeli shares on NASDAQ has lost around 
24%, dropping to its lowest level since its launch on November 17, 
¶2006.  The Jerusalem Post reported that the local property market is 
expected to take a hit from the American meltdown. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that in an interview with the Iranian 
Press-TV, Lauren Booth, the sister-in-law of Tony Blair, called Gaza 
a "concentration camp" and a "humanitarian crisis on the scale of 
Darfur." 
 
Makor Rishon-Hatzofe reported that yesterday for the first time a 
group of Neturei Karta ultra-Orthodox took part in an anti-security 
fence demonstration in Na'alin. 
 
Citing a Reuters report, Ha'aretz quoted CIA Director Gen. Michael 
Hayden as saying on Tuesday that the destruction of a suspected 
Syrian nuclear reactor in September 2007 was the result of an 
intelligence collaboration that included a "foreign partner" who 
first identified the facility's purpose. 
 
All media reported on yesterday's attack against the U.S. Embassy in 
Sanaa, which was purportedly carried out by Al-Qaida. 
Maariv reported that an Israeli businessman residing in New York, a 
former IDF officer, sold a computer defense program used by the 
Israel Police to an Arab state. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that the 26th Conference of Mayors is 
underway in the city this week with more that 40 mayors and 
governors from around the globe.  The newspaper said that previous 
conferences were the "quintessential mix of tourism and socializing, 
with a little international municipal comparison and discussion 
mixed in."  Starting this year, the U.S. mayors in attendance were 
provided with business-development meetings so that they could bring 
something tangible back to their communities. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that all visa requirements for Israeli 
and Russian nationals traveling between their countries will be 
canceled as of Saturday. 
 
Maariv "new journalism" columnist Ron Maiberg wrote that although he 
used to hold a Green Card and he loves Americans, they unnerve him 
and he would never take an American passport.

Summary:

Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote in the independent, 
left-leaning Ha'aretz: "Whoever succeeds Olmert will ... have to 
choose among less than stellar options.... There is no reason to be 
jealous of the winner." 
 
Veteran journalist Hemmi Shalev wrote on page one of the independent 
Israel Hayom: "Livni needs to be careful not to squander the credit 
she has built up and the momentum she has gained from her victory by 
engaging in cynical and enervating coalition negotiations." 
 
Senior columnist Nahum Barnea wrote in the mass-circulation, 
pluralist Yediot Aharonot: "The real battle begins now.  Livni still 
hasn't put together a political team that can help her meet the 
challenges that lie ahead." 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Herb Keinon wrote on page one of the 
conservative, independent Jerusalem Post: "The fate of the 
Israeli-Palestinian diplomatic process will be determined more by 
whom the Palestinians select as their leader ... than on whom the 
40,000 or so Kadima voters ... decided should succeed Olmert."

¶I.  "Don't Envy the Winner" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote in the independent, 
left-leaning Ha'aretz (9/18): "On what will Olmert's heir be able to 
focus?.... Serious negotiations with the Palestinian Authority will 
endanger the coalition because of Shas, and in any case, the public 
doesn't believe that such a deal is possible.... Getting the talks 
[with Syria] to the next level ahead of a deal requires American 
intervention; the outgoing administration isn't interested, and the 
incoming one will need some time to formulate a policy.  Preparing 
the country to face the Iranian threat will ... take away 
Netanyahu's best card in the general election.  But the risk here is 
great.  The public will start expecting a preemptive war against 
Iran to keep it from developing nuclear weapons.  This would require 
American support, which does not currently exist, but failing to 
follow through would turn the prime minister into a pathetic figure. 
 If the new prime minister initiates a conflict with the settlers, 
as Ariel Sharon did, that would strengthen Kadima in the eyes of 
centrist voters but would create a deep internal rift, and it's 
doubtful that Olmert's successor will have the public standing or 
political ability to make such a move.  Going to elections hastily, 
before the leadership of Olmert's heir gets imprinted onto the 
public consciousness, would be political suicide.... Whoever 
succeeds Olmert will therefore have to choose among less than 
stellar options, putting the new leader to a complex test at a time 
when the public wants to find its way out of the doldrums of the 
past two years, but does not believe in the political system.  One 
can only conclude that there is no reason to be jealous of the 
winner." 
 
II.  "The Golda-Palin Effect" 
 
Veteran journalist Hemmi Shalev wrote on page one of the independent 
Israel Hayom (9/18): "The good news is that Livni's victory last 
night will hasten the end of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's failed 
term in office and will expedite purging politics of the ills that 
he ushered in.  At the very least, it will kindle hope of a calmer 
public discourse and of cleaner governmental politics.  There are 
some people who question Livni's moral right to form an alternative 
coalition government, but one cannot deny her legal right to try. 
The potential partners all seem to be talking about their desire to 
hold elections quickly, but experience has taught us that we can be 
skeptical about those statements, some of which are made more as a 
means of establishing a bargaining position than as an matter of 
principle.  With that having been said, after weeks of campaigning 
that wasn't terribly pleasing aesthetically, Livni needs to be 
careful not to squander the credit she has built up and the momentum 
she has gained from her victory by engaging in cynical and 
enervating coalition negotiations.  A few weeks of wholesale give 
and take with the sly Shas foxes will be enough to crack her Mother 
Theresa image and send Livni, beaten, tarred, and feathered, in the 
event of failure, into general elections." 
 
III.  "Yes to Livni" 
 
Senior columnist Nahum Barnea wrote in the mass-circulation, 
pluralist Yediot Aharonot (9/18): "Livni's victory ... did not stem 
from an organizational feat or political alliances.  It stemmed from 
the yearning within the general public for a new, fresh, and mainly 
clean leadership.  Livni succeeded at being, at least for now, both 
a princess and Cinderella.  She is a princess because she was born 
into a political household and entered the political establishment 
under the wing of the [Likud] party elders, who were fonder of her 
parents than they were of her.   She is Cinderella because her rise 
to the top was so swift.  Her prince was Ariel Sharon.  Politicians 
and the other party leaders were right to say last night that 
Livni's election was still a far cry from ensuring her the 
premiership.  She is going to have to engage in exhausting 
negotiations that will oblige her to be more cunning and 
manipulative than she has ever had to be before.  That does not mean 
that her chances of forming a new coalition government are 
negligible.... The real battle begins now.  Livni still hasn't put 
together a political team that can help her meet the challenges that 
lie ahead." 
 
IV.  "Palestinian Internal Politics Are Even More Important than 
Kadima Primary" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Herb Keinon wrote on page one of the 
conservative, independent Jerusalem Post (9/18): "The fate of the 
Israeli-Palestinian diplomatic process will be determined more by 
whom the Palestinians select as their leader in January -- if indeed 
elections in the Palestinian Authority are held -- than on whom the 
40,000 or so Kadima voters who troubled themselves to go to the 
polls Wednesday decided should succeed Olmert.  We Israelis like to 
think we're in control, that we dictate the pace and outcome of 
events.  But we don't.  There is another side, and what is happening 
over there domestically is equally important, if not more important, 
to the fate of the diplomatic process than what is happening over 
here.  The question of whether Hamas manages to wrangle control of 
the PA from Fatah or whether Fatah succeeds in wresting back control 
in Gaza is more important in the long run for the peace process than 
whether Tzipi Livni or Shaul Mofaz becomes Kadima's leader and -- 
possibly -- the prime minister for a few months.
