RUSSIA: CRITICAL OF THE ANTI-TERROR COALITION 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. At the beginning of its speech, Russia called the war in 
Iraq a violation of international law under the "false 
pretext" of the fight on terror.  Continuing, the speaker 
asked if the casualties in Afghanistan were an "acceptable 
price" to pay in countering terrorism.  Russia argued that 
the coalition's operating method has created a "unipolar," 
rather than cooperative, international security framework, 
leading to the aggression in South Ossetia that Russia helped 
repel.  In addition to defending its recent actions in 
Georgia, Russia commented that the international community 
should not "artificially undermine" its relationships with 
partner countries that have "a common history and geography." 
However, the Czech Republic criticized Russia for its actions 
against Georgia and called on the international community to 
assist in alleviating the suffering of those displaced. 
 
NORTH KOREA: DERIDES U.S. FOR HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶3. North Korea called the United States "the worst human 
rights violator, evidenced by its armed invasion of sovereign 
countries and unhesitatingly massacring of innocent 
civilians."  The speaker deemed the U.S.-South Korean August 
2008 joint military exercise "war drills mounting a 
preemptive nuclear strike on the DPRK."  He also accused the 
United States of hindering implementation of the Six-Party 
October 2007 agreement and September 2005 joint statement, 
prompting North Korea to take "relevant countermeasures." 
Regarding Japan, he opposed its request for a Security 
Council seat due to its "history of aggression and massacre" 
against Korea during World War II (which Japan addressed in a 
right of reply). 
 
GENERAL THEMES 
-------------- 
 
¶4. Speakers continued to address progress toward the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDG's) in light of the food, 
energy and financial crises, calling for developed countries 
to fulfill their commitments.  In contrast to most speakers, 
Hungary insisted that the current crises should not be an 
excuse for giving up on the MDG's.  Many speakers 
specifically addressed the need for increased action to 
reduce greenhouse gases to ameliorate the damaging effects of 
climate change.  On the democratization of the United 
Nations, most countries included references to the reform or 
expansion of the Security Council.  Concerning security 
issues, other speakers reiterated their support for the fight 
against terrorism as well as called on the international 
community to bolster efforts to rebuild Afghanistan and to 
resolve the Iraeli-Palestinian conflict.
