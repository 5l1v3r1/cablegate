SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. Renewable energies expert Dr. Doug Arent from the U.S. National 
Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) spoke at a series of events in 
Chile and Argentina on energy technology and energy efficiency, 
issues of primary importance to the national security of these two 
countries.  Dr. Arent's visit was arranged under Public Diplomacy's 
International Information Program.  His presentations to government, 
private sector and academic audiences were well-received, and they 
attracted considerable press attention.  END SUMMARY. 
 
----- 
CHILE 
----- 
 
¶2. Dr. Arent's visit to Chile was very productive.  Ambassador Paul 
Simons demonstrated extraordinary support for the program and 
actively participated during all three days. 
 
¶3. Dr. Arent was well received by the Chilean National Energy 
Commission and Ministry of Treasury (on biofuels and energy 
efficiency), the Science and Technology commission (CONICYT), 
investors and banking groups (CORFO, Fundacion Chile), and business 
groups (AmCham/Chile, SOFOFA, CIFCO, etc.).  He lectured to a 
multidisciplinary audience at the public University of Chile and a 
standing-room only event at University of Talca. 
 
¶4. Arent's visit received substantial media coverage and very 
positive reactions from the Chilean public. During the Government of 
Chile (GOC) meeting on biofuels and energy efficiency Dr. Arent was 
able to provide feedback on Chile's current plans to create a number 
of biofuels pilot plants across the country.  Chileans sought advice 
on capturing international investment in these demonstrative plants, 
technical cooperation opportunities, and research and development 
challenges associated with second-generation (cellulosic) biofuels. 
Chileans seemed positively impressed by Dr. Arent's extensive 
knowledge and respect for the GOC's positions. 
 
¶5. COMMENTS Meetings with the private sector and investors were more 
subdued compared to the enthusiasm at universities and with Chilean 
government (GOC) representatives. END COMMENT. 
 
--------- 
ARGENTINA 
--------- 
 
¶5. Dr. Arent's visit to Buenos Aires was content-filled.  Dr. Arent 
spoke to private sector experts at Argentina's Business Council for 
Sustainable Development (CEADS), to political and technical staff of 
the Government of Argentina (GOA) Secretariat of Energy, and 
professors and undergraduate students at the University of Buenos 
Aires. 
 
¶6. Dr. Arent also spoke to an enthusiastic group of grad students at 
the University of Social and Business Sciences (UCES).  To close off 
Dr. Arent's visit, ECON Officer Douglas Climan and ESTH Officer 
James Perez accompanied him to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
 
¶7. COMMENT:  The Argentina program received less enthusiasm from the 
government of Argentina.  The GOA representatives seemed to have an 
intrinsic distrust of a "hidden agenda". END COMMENT.

FOLLOW-UP 
--------- 
¶8. Dr. Arent mentioned the possibility of making his presentations 
available online and having one of NREL's Spanish-speaking experts 
respond to questions online. 
 
¶9. Another opportunity for collaboration is NREL's expert visitors 
program.  During the week of August 20, the NREL facilities in 
Golden, Colorado was planning to receive a group of South American 
experts to learn more about NREL's Bio for Biofuels Program.  Their 
visit was made possible through the Cochran Fellowship Program, 
which is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's 
Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS). 
 
---------- 
CONCLUSION 
---------- 
¶10. The Strategic Speaker Initiative is an excellent mechanism to 
leverage funds towards ESTH issues with a regional perspective.  For 
under USD 5,000, the Department of State was able to reach a 
significant number of government representatives, university 
professors, students, private investors, and business groups.  Much 
of the South American public was not aware of the USG's advanced 
work in renewable energies, instead looking to Europe for renewable 
energy examples.
