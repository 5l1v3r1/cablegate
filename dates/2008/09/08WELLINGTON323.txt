¶1. (U)  Summary.  On September 10, the governments of 
New Zealand and Australia announced a joint venture to 
undertake non-lethal scientific research of whales in 
the South Oceans to better manage whale numbers in the 
region.  Although both governments avoided characterising 
the proposed research program as a means to confront 
Japan's whaling research program, Greenpeace New Zealand 
would like it to be used in this way.  Both governments 
will now work toward developing the research program and 
building support within the ICW, with the expectation that 
it will begin in late 2009-10.  End Summary. 
 
Joint New Whale Conservation Initiative Unveiled 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶2. (U)  On September 10, New Zealand Conservation 
Minister Steve Chadwick and Australian Environment 
Minister Peter Garrett announced in Auckland a joint 
New Zealand-Australia initiative to develop a non- 
lethal whale research in the Southern Ocean.  Garrett 
stated that the aim of the initiative is to increase 
the global commitment to non-lethal research to better 
manage the recovery of whales.  He cited the dramatic 
reduction in whale numbers in the South Ocean region, 
particularly the South Pacific Humpback, as 
justification for non-lethal research.  Chadwick 
stated that the new initiative in the Southern Ocean 
would build on the innovative and collaborative 
approach Australia and New Zealand have always brought 
to this area.  Both governments predict the initiative 
will expand its membership to other nations active in 
or neighbouring the Southern Ocean. 
 
Part of a Larger Plan to Reform the ICW 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU)  The initiative is led by Australia, which 
proposed the creation of a world-wide collection of 
research partnerships, such as the Southern Ocean 
initiative, in advance of the June 23-27, 2008 
International Whaling Commission (IWC) meeting in 
Chile.  The proposal was widely welcomed at that 
meeting, which included delegates from the United 
Kingdom and hosts, Chile.  New Zealand Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs (MFAT) Policy Officer Finnian Cheshire 
of the Environment Division told post that The GNZ has 
not yet received any explicit statements of support 
for the proposal from IWC-member governments. 
However, he expressed confidence that broad support will be 
forthcoming once governments further study the 
proposal.  The creation of world-wide research 
partnerships forms part of a larger New Zealand and 
Australia plan to modernise the  IWC and make it into 
a 21st Century conservation-focused organisation. 
 
Confronting Japan Not the Goal 
------------------------------ 
 
¶4. (SBU)  Both ministers were careful in public 
remarks to avoid mentioning Japan and its 
controversial scientific whaling policy.  MFAT's 
Cheshire stressed that the proposed initiative should 
be seen exclusively as a genuine program of non-lethal 
research rather than a means to directly confront 
Japan.  However, Greenpeace New Zealand Executive 
Director Bunny McDiarmid hopes that the initiative 
will openly challenge the legitimacy of Japan's whale 
research program.  McDiarmid hoped that the program 
will be a serious challenge to Japan's supposedly 
scientific program that kills whales while offering 
little scientific value for the past 20 years and 
asserted that scientific study of whales on the South 
Ocean could be gathered without killing whales.  The 
Japanese Government has not commented on the proposed 
non-lethal research program. 
 
Economic Upside 
--------------- 
 
¶5. (U)  Chadwick believes that there is a significant 
economic upside for the region in developing non- 
lethal scientific whale research.  She claimed that 
because the proposed science is reliable and would 
 
WELLINGTON 00000323  002 OF 002 
 
 
support sustainable management of whales, the whale- 
watching industry in Australia, New Zealand and other 
Pacific Island countries would benefit enormously. 
 
Next Steps 
---------- 
 
¶6. (SBU)  Chadwick and Garrett announced that both 
their governments would continue to work together to 
reform the management of science in the IWC and 
evelop internationally-agreed, cooperative 
conservation management plans for whales.  Garrett 
stated that Australia plans to host an international 
gathering of whale scientists in February 2009 to 
draft a five-year research plan for whales in the 
Southern Ocean.  He anticipated that this plan will be 
reviewed by the IWC Scientific Committee and finalised 
in June 2009, with the research program expected to 
begin in late 2009-10.  MFAT's Cheshire said the 
initiative is still a work in progress and that the 
New Zealand Government is now engaged in a process of 
determining the how best to further contribute to the 
South Oceans initiative and whether its jurisdiction 
should be expanded to include the Ross Sea.
