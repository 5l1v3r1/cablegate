¶1. (SBU) Summary.  In response to reports of isolated cases of 
cholera in various areas of Iraq, the Government of Jordan had 
directed the medical screening of people arriving from Iraq.  It has 
also imposed a temporary ban on the import of non-canned food 
products from Iraq.  The number of reported cases varies depending 
on who is reporting and the degree of seriousness remains open to 
question.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (U) Press accounts in Jordan have reported the banning of food 
imports (other than canned goods) into Jordan 
for the next two months due to concerns over possible contamination 
from an "outbreak" of cholera in neighboring Iraq.  The Government 
of Jordan (GoJ) instituted this ban on September 10, noting that 
similar measures taken in 2007 were effective in helping prevent the 
spread of the disease at that time. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Jordanian Ministry of Health (MoH) subsequently 
announced on September 12 that all passengers arriving to Jordan 
from Iraq would need to complete a questionnaire and submit it to a 
"health squad" at all Jordanian ports-of-entry.   If indications of 
cholera are found, the individual would be sent to a local hospital, 
at GoJ expense, for laboratory testing.  So far only Iraqis have 
been subjected to this screening.  A MoH representative commented to 
EmbOffs that while Jordan has not yet actually discovered a case of 
cholera among arriving Iraqis, and little would actually change in 
day-to-day activities, this screening procedure would remain in 
effect for two months. 
 
¶4. (SBU) World Health Organization (WHO), the UN, and Embassy 
Baghdad (reftel) are aware of the health threat, but none indicated 
serious concerns.  The most recent information indicates that as of 
28 September there are  340 confirmed cases, with five fatalities. 
This remains significantly less than in 2007 when, by the end of 
September, there were reportedly more than 1,400 confirmed cases. 
Note:  The September 2007 outbreak resulted in a total of 4,696 
cases and 28 deaths.  End note.  A WHO report dated September 10, 
noted that as the overall quality of water and sanitation in Iraq 
remains poor, cholera infection/contamination/outbreak is possible.
