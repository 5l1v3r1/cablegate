SUBJECT: NIGERIA: MEND DECLARES CEASEFIRE FOLLOWING WEEK OF 
HEIGHTENED ACTIVITY 
 
REF: ABUJA 1898 
 
Classified By: Acting Political Counselor Cheryl Fernandes for reasons 
1.4. (b & d). 
 
¶1. (SBU) Following a September 13 raid by the Joint Task 
Force (JTF) on the Elem Tombia area (south of Port Harcourt, 
Rivers State), the armed group MEND (Movement for the 
Emancipation of the Niger Delta) mounted a week-long string 
of attacks against oil interests in the Niger Delta region. 
However, MEND promised in an e-mail directed to Nigerian 
media outlets to begin an indefinite, unilateral ceasefire 
effective 0100 hours, September 21.  According to press 
reports, the MEND statement maintained that "after one week 
of intense lopsided fighting and an unprecedented sabotage on 
the oil industry prompted by an unprovoked attack on civilian 
communities, the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger 
Delta will downgrade the oil war code named "Hurricane 
Barbarossa" to a state of alert code named "Tropical Storm 
Vigilant."  "We hope that the military has learnt a bitter 
lesson.  The next unprovoked attack will start another oil 
war that will be so ferocious that it will dim the pleas of 
the elders.  That blood oil war will come in the form of 
another hurricane and its devastation and mode of operation 
will be different from what was seen with Barbarossa." 
 
¶2. (SBU) Press also reported that MEND leader Victor 
Ebikabowei (Boyloaf), Niger Delta Vigilante leader Ateke Tom, 
Niger Delta Patriotic Front leader Farah Dangogo, and Ijaw 
Youth Leadership Forum leader Chief Ekpemupolo were 
reportedly sending delegations to Abuja on September 22 to 
discuss conditions for laying down arms and pave the way for 
the smooth inauguration of the Niger Delta Ministry (reftel). 
 The delegations will also reportedly discuss terms for Henry 
Okah's release and amnesty for militants. 
 
¶3. (C) Kwara State Governor and leader of the Governors' 
Forum Bukola Saraki told the Ambassador on September 22 that 
the ceasefire was a joint, not unilateral, effort coordinated 
by the Yar'Adua administration, and that the ceasefire would 
start today or tomorrow.  (Comment.  If, indeed, the 
ceasefire is a negotiated agreement brokered by the GON 
rather than a unilateral action on the part of MEND, it may 
be designed to give the new Niger Delta Ministry the 
breathing room it needs to begin to address the underlying 
issues of the region.  On the other hand, it may be yet 
another attempt to kick the ball further down the field once 
again -- avoiding action but giving the impression of 
movement.  End Comment.)
