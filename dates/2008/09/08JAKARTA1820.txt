¶1.  Post has received the official invitation to the upcoming

Eleven/F-11) Plus Partners in Jakarta on October 17, 2008 (reftel). 
The GOI Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) and Forest Ministry will

¶2008.  Participants are requested to register by October 10. 
 
¶2.  The invitation, signed by both the Minister of Foreign Affairs

Jakarta, 22 September 2008 
 
Excellency, 
 
We are writing to you in the spirit of the consensus reached during 
the Meeting of Tropical Rainforest Countries (Forest Eleven) with 
other rainforest countries and partner countries held in Bali in 
December 2007 on the sideline of the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). On that occasion we all 
stressed the need to strengthen international cooperation in the 
field of sustainable forest management. 
 
Thus all participants reiterated the commitment to promote among all 
stakeholders cooperation in sustainable forest management and in 
addressing the challenge of deforestation. 
 
Accordingly, Forest Eleven (F-11) is now drafting a Tropical 
Rainforest Countries (F-11) Cooperation Framework to translate the 
commitments reached in the Joint Statement of Tropical Rainforest 
Countries' Leaders of 24 September 2007 into a set of concrete and 
concerted cooperation to complement the process towards post-2012 
international climate change arrangement. 
 
In the light of these developments, we are pleased to invite you to 
Jakarta for an F-11 + Partner Countries Ministerial Meeting on 17 
October 2008 to further strengthen our cooperation. 
 
We look forward to welcoming you and working closely with you in 
Jakarta. 
 
Please accept, Excellency, the assurances of our highest 
consideration. 
 
Dr. N. Hassan Wirajuda 
Minister for Foreign Affairs 
 
Dr. (HC) M.S. Kaban 
Minister for Forestry
