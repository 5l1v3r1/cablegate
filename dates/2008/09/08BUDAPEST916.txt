SUBJECT: HUNGARY'S VIEW ON REBUTTING RUSSIA'S CLAIMS 
AGAINST GEORGIA 
 
REF: SECSTATE 98030 
 
¶1. (SBU) MFA Security and Non-proliferation Department Head 
Vilmos Hamikus discussed reftel with PolOff on September 17. 
Hamikus commented that Hungary would most likely work within 
the EU framework rather than making an individual statement 
on Russia's genocide claim.  He noted that the September 
15-16 GAERC meeting was entirely devoted to the EU's planned 
observer mission in Georgia and the reftel subject was not 
addressed. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Queried as to possible Hungarian participation in 
the EU mission, Hamikus said that their offer of a POLAD was 
turned down but Hungary was still offering five observers for 
the 200 person contingent, noting that there are currently 
300 volunteers.  He stated that the EU wants at least a 
twenty-person team and an armored vehicle from participating 
countries, making it difficult for Hungary to contribute to 
the operation.  Hamikus stated that they were in discussion 
with Austria and France about a cooperative effort to allow 
Hungarian participation.
