SUBJECT: RECOMMENDATION FOR PRESIDENTIAL DELEGATION TO 
ATTEND CEREMONIES MARKING THE 90 ANNIVERSARY OF POLAND'S 
INDEPENDENCE 
 
¶1. (SBU) Embassy Warsaw recommends that a presidential 
delegation at the highest possible level represent the United 
States at commemoration ceremonies in Warsaw on November 11 
marking the 90th anniversary of Poland's regaining its 
independence.  This is a tremendously significant milestone 
for the Poles along the way to their first centennial, and 
will be marked by private and officials celebrations, 
notionally to including a ceremony at the tomb of the unknown 
soldier and a gala ball, hosted by President Lech Kaczynski. 
This would also be an fitting occasion to draw attention to 
the upcoming 90th anniversary of U.S.-Polish relations, which 
officially kicks off in 2009. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The United States is intimately associated with the 
formation of the modern Polish state.  Point 13 in President 
Wilson's "14 Points" speech called for the re-establishment 
of a Polish state following World War I. At Versailles peace 
talks, Wilson pressed hard to ensure that the new state came 
into being, a position not all participants to the talks 
shared. No other nation played as central a role in the 
establishment of the free and independent nation of Poland. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Over the past 90 years, Poland has proven that it 
is willing to pay a high price for freedom.  The Polish 
population triumphed - at great human cost - over foreign 
occupation and domestic oppression to become a free 
democratic state. Poland has evolved into an exceptionally 
strong partner to the United States in advancing the 
President's Freedom Agenda around the world.  The occasion 
offers a unique opportunity for the USG to demonstrate 
solidarity with the Polish people and to thank Poland for its 
unwavering support.  Among other things, Poland has 
vigorously condemned Russian aggression against Georgia, 
contributed troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, agreed to host a 
missile defense interceptor site to protect the United States 
and Europe, and co-founded both the Proliferation Security 
Initiative and the Community of Democracies Movement, but the 
goes on.
