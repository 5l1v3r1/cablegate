¶1.  This cable is intended to provide an update on exploration and 
production activity as it relates to pre-salt oil reserves in 
Brazil.  Pre-salt refers to a 500-mile wide "new frontier" area in 
Brazil, located under a thick layer of salt -- 350 miles off of 
Brazil's southeastern coast at an average water depth of over 7000 
feet.  About 25 percent of the pre-salt area has already been 
contracted to private companies through Brazil's competitive bid 
round process.  Petrobras (Brazil) holds the greatest stake in these 
blocks; the other international oil companies with pre-salt 
interests (through consortiums) are Shell, Petrogal, BG Group, 
Repsol YPF, Exxon Mobil and Hess.  The government is currently 
considering regulatory changes aimed at capturing more revenue and 
has suspended the licensing of further oil rights in the pre-salt 
area since late 2006. 
 
First Pre-Salt Well Comes On Line 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  On September 2, President Lula was on hand to launch Brazil's 
pre-salt production as Petrobras officially brought its first 
pre-salt well on line.  The well is located in the Campos Basin's 
"Jubarte" field off the coast of the state of Espirito Santo. 
Petrobras has invested USD 30.5 million in the well.  Output is 
expected to reach 18,000 barrels per day.  According to Petrobras, 
data from Jubarte drilling will be used to fine-tune the company's 
strategy for what it expects to be larger reserves in the Santos 
basin. 
 
Large Tupi Field Scheduled To Begin Output Next Year 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶3.  Meanwhile, initial production at Petrobras' "Tupi" field 
(BM-S-11) in the Santos basin is scheduled to begin in mid-late 
¶2009.  Tupi is considered the largest oil discovery in the Americas 
since 1976, estimated to hold between 5-8 billion barrels of oil. 
Initial output is expected at 20,000-30,000 barrels per day, with 
estimates that pilot production could reach 100,000 barrels per day 
by 2011.  Peak production, not expected until 2026, is planned at 
one million barrels per day. 
 
How U.S. Companies are Positioned in the Pre-Salt Play 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶4.  Exxon Mobil and Hess are the only two U.S. companies with 
pre-salt stakes, both holding 40 percent interests in the block 
(BM-S-22) which is currently estimated to be the apex of the largest 
structure in the pre-salt area.  Petrobras has a 20 percent stake in 
that block.  Test well drilling is planned to launch in October 
¶2008.  Chevron dropped out of an earlier partnership (before oil was 
discovered in the pre-salt area) for what is now called the "Parati" 
field (BM-S-10); company representatives have said privately that 
they seriously regret that decision. 
 
More Data Needed, Probably Not One Giant Field 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶5.  Given the extreme depth of the pre-salt reserves and the 
technical difficulty in drilling through such a thick layer of salt, 
experts agree that a lot more data is needed to properly assess the 
area and what will be required to develop it.  Petrobras Director 
for Exploration and Production Guillerme Estrella has said that the 
company hopes to have a complete evaluation of Brazil's pre-salt 
reserves by 2010.  Initial rumors suggested that the pre-salt area 
could be one giant field, supported by the evidence that all the 
test wells drilled in the pre-salt area so far have found oil. 
Industry insiders, though, say that this 100 percent success rate is 
absolutely unsustainable.  Petrobras has recently updated its 
assessment, its data suggesting several big areas within the 
pre-salt area as opposed to one giant field.
