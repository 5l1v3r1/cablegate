¶1. (U) As of September 2008, this is the data we have on 
Egypt's UNAMID deployment.  Egypt's initial planned 
contribution to UNAMID was 1,520 personnel, which it has not 
yet met.  This number appears to have increased with the 
commitment of a second infantry battalion of approximately 
850 personnel. 
 
¶2. (SBU) To date Egypt has deployed 683 troops to UNAMID. 
Most recently, Egypt completed the full deployment of its 
335-person engineering company, with the arrival in Darfur of 
126 engineers in July and another 126 engineers on August 12. 
 In May, Egypt sent 185 signals personnel to Darfur.  They 
joined 128 military observers and 35 police trainers that had 
previously been deployed.  Additionally, Egypt has sent over 
800 troops to the UN Mission in Southern Sudan (UNMIS). 
 
¶3. (SBU) Egypt still needs to deploy two infantry 
battalions--of approximately 850 personnel per batallion--and 
150 medium transport personnel in order to fulfill its UNAMID 
commitment.  Post is endeavoring to set up a meeting with the 
UN Affairs office in the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
to discuss deployment plans for these troops, but the meeting 
may be delayed until the end of Ramadan and the Eid al-Fitr 
holiday.
