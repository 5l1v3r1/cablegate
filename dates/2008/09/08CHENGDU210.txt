¶1. (SBU)  This cable contains sensitive but unclassified 
information - not for distribution on the Internet. 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Summary:  Official data published on the Ministry of 
Environmental Protection website strongly suggests that Chengdu 
air quality data is being manipulated to appear cleaner than it 
is, despite official claims that the data from local air quality 
monitors is aggregated and sent to Beijing automatically.  Both 
the Sichuan provincial-level Environmental Protection Bureau and 
the Chengdu Environmental Protection Bureau claim air quality in 
Chengdu to be gradually improving, but already in general "very 
good."  Apparent manipulation going back to at least 2001 makes 
it difficult to verify this claim.  End Summary. 
 
 
 
What Officials Say about the Air 
 
------------------------------------------ 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Director of Science and Technology and 
International Cooperation at Sichuan's provincial-level 
Environmental Protection Bureau, Zhao Lechen, told Congenoff 
recently that Chengdu's air quality data is gathered by eight 
air quality monitors spread throughout the city.  He said that 
the monitors are generally placed on top of buildings and 
reported data automatically to back to a regional control center 
in Chengdu.  The data is then passed automatically to Beijing, 
where it is posted on the Ministry of Environmental Protection's 
website.  Zhao asserted that the city's air quality is improving 
gradually over time. 
 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Deputy Director at Chengdu's Environmental 
Protection Bureau, Shen Shaoji, also claimed that data from 
local air quality monitoring stations is transmitted 
automatically to Beijing.  Shen said that moves to reduce 
pollution, such as banning coal burning inside the city's third 
ring road, restrictions on the use of government vehicles by one 
day per week, and encouraging residents who lived less than 1.2 
miles from work to avoid driving to work has contributed to the 
claimed increase in air quality in the city.  Both Shen and Zhao 
said that while Chengdu could further improve its air quality, 
air quality is in general far better than in cities like Beijing. 
 
 
 
Comments 
 
--------------- 
 
 
 
¶5. (SBU) Both Shen and Zhao were very optimistic about Sichuan 
and Chengdu's environmental conditions and outlook, and neither 
told Congenoff that the city faced any significant challenges. 
China defines excellent and good air quality as a day having an 
air pollution index (API) value between 0 - 100.  Analysis of 
Chengdu's air quality data between 1 January 2001 and 15 
September 2008 shows that during those years there were many 
days on which air pollution exceeded an API of 100, but  were 
recorded as being lower than 100.  This year, from 1 January to 
15 September, Chengdu recorded 62 days with an API 91-100, but 
only 2 days with a value of 101-110.  This is consistent with 
air quality data manipulation techniques discussed in reftel. 
 
 
 
¶6. (SBU) In a normal distribution of data, one would expect to 
see approximately 23 more days with an API 101-110. The same 
pattern of data manipulation holds true for previous years.  In 
2007 Chengdu recorded 77 days between API 91-100, and only 6 
between 101-110. For the entire data set from 2001-2008, Chengdu 
reported 620 days between API 91-100, about 80 percent more than 
would be expected in this random set of pollution data.  Days 
between 101-110 were less than half of their normal distribution 
for a data set.
