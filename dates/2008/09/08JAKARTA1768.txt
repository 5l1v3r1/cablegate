NO-SHOW AT SEPT. 17 HEARING 
 
REF: JAKARTA 1742 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1.  (U) This message is Sensitive But Unclassified.  Please 
handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Legal proceedings were scheduled to begin in the 
Central Jakarta District Court on September 17 in the 
avian-influenza lawsuit against the USG and the World Health 
Organization (refs).  On DEPLU's advice, neither the USG nor 
its agent appeared at the September 17 proceedings.  Mission 
did send an FSN to observe the proceedings. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The court clerk told an FSN that because the 
plaintiff did not attend the proceedings, the hearing was 
canceled.  The clerk stated that the judge had postponed the 
hearing until October 10. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The court has asked the plaintiff to provide 
additional funds for administrative fees.  In civil cases, 
the plaintiff must pay a fee for the issuance of a summons. 
The court has issued three summons to the defendants and 
there is no longer any funding available for a fourth 
summons. According to the clerk, the plaintiff was asked to 
provide additional funds to the court if the plaintiff 
intended to continue the case.  The plaintiff has not 
complied with the court's request. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) If the plaintiff provides additional funding before 
October 10, the court could issue a fourth and final summons 
to the defendants.  If there is a fourth hearing, and the 
defendants do not appear, the case could proceed and the 
judge could issue a ruling without the defendants present. 
The clerk explained that if the plaintiff had not provided 
the requested funds before October 10, the clerk would 
request that the judge dismiss the case for failure to pursue 
the claim. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) There was no press coverage of the court 
proceedings.
