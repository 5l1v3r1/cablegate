¶2. (SBU)  Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Italian MFA 
Coordinator for Afghanistan Sergio Mercuri and MFA 
Political-Military Office Deputy Director Carlo Batori on 
September 3.  Mercuri and Batori both reiterated Italian 
support for ANA expansion in principle (Ref B), but stressed 
that the GOI will need more details on the proposal before 
committing funds.  In a subsequent discussion on September 8 
Batori said that MOD Wardak had made an excellent case for 
ANA expansion at the NAC on September 3 but that many 
questions still remain.  The ANA already has difficulties 
with recruitment and desertions, Batori said; can it 
effectively grow to the 134,000-troop level?  A larger ANA 
would, he agreed, help address some of the current CJSOR 
shortfalls, but it would also create a need for additional 
OMLTs and possibly divert scarce training resources away from 
the "underprioritized" Afghan National Police. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Batori also cautioned that all of Italy's foreign 
aid and defense programs are facing the possibility of deep 
budget cuts under the current government.  (Note: Budget cuts 
in defense spending alone are projected to total USD 2.5 
billion over the next three years.)  Although Afghanistan 
will remain a top priority for the GOI, he said, large new 
outlays of donor assistance are unlikely beyond the Euro 50 
million/year commitment Italy made at the June 2008 Paris 
Conference.
