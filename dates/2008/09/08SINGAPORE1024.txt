QIOPTIQ SINGAPORE PTE LTD - APPLICATION NUMBER: D389694 
 
REF. USDOC 05578 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), CommAttache TODD AVERY, CommSpec CHAN Y K and Senior 
Special Agent RUSSEL PERRAS from the Container Security Initiative, 
Department of Homeland Security conducted a post 
shipment-verification (PSV) at Qioptiq Singapore Pte Ltd, 8 Tractor 
Road, Singapore 627969 (TEL: 65-6499 7777 ; FAX: 65-6261 4833). The 
items in question are two Moore Nanotechnology Nanotech 2-Axis 
turning lathes (S/Ns 2008-87-CPL and 2008-88-CPL) exported to 
Qioptiq on or about June 25, 2008.  The items are classified under 
Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) 2B001 and are controlled 
for national security (NS) and nuclear nonproliferation (NP) 
reasons.  The exporter was Sackman Associates of Sudbury, 
Massachusetts. 
 
¶3. Emboffs met with Mr. Peter Yeo (Export Compliance Manager), Mr. 
Wong C C (Export Control Officer), Mr. Nasrul (Process Development 
Engineer) and Ms. Jenny Choo (Supply Chain Manager) to brief them on 
the procedures and requirements outlined in their export license. 
 
¶4. From the interview and site inspection, Emboffs established that 
Qioptiq had ordered the commodities and is using them to machine 
optical lenses for the defense industry. Emboffs verified that the 
captioned commodities are two of four CNC lathes installed in 
Qioptiq's Technology Center within their production facility. 
Qioptiq indicated that three of the for lathes are currently being 
used to machine optical lenses for British Aerospace in the U.S. and 
the fourth is being used for R&D purposes evaluating infra-red 
material such as germanium. So far, the lathes have not been used 
for any projects or customers other than BAe Systems. 
 
¶5. Emboffs verified that Qioptiq was informed of the applicable 
license conditions (as required by the relevant licenses) and that 
it keeps a production log as required by those licenses. 
 
¶6. At the time visited, Qioptiq appeared to be a suitable recipient 
of the commodities shipped since Qioptiq cooperated with the PSV, 
provided Emboffs with access to the items and related documents and 
operates a line of business consistent with the use of the items. 
Also, Qioptiq is familiar with the applicable license conditions and 
expressed its commitment to comply with them.
