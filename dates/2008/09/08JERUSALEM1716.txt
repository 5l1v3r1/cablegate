Main Stories:

"Greater Israel is over... anyone who talks that way is delusional," 
according to Israeli Premier Olmert, whose comments to the Israeli 
cabinet on September 14 lead coverage in Al Quds and Al Ayyam.  In 
separate reporting, all front-pages highlight Olmert's condemnation 
of recent attacks by Jewish settlers on two West Bank villages near 
Nablus, describing the attacks as "murderous."  The reports detail 
the number of Palestinians injured and damage to Palestinian 
agricultural land, downplaying official Israeli statements promising 
to deal firmly with settler violence. 
 
Remarks by Hamas leader Khalid Mish'al stating that there will be no 
legitimate Palestinian president after January 2009 unless new 
elections are held, is front page news in all dailies.  Al-Ayyam 
leads with the story under the headline, "Mish'al initiates battle 
over the Presidency, refusing to recognize the legitimacy of the 
[PLO] Executive Committee."  Other stories quote Palestinian 
Authority President Abbas noting that Palestinian law will be the 
basis for resolving the issue. 
 
Citing Israeli daily Yediot Ahranut, Al-Ayyam front-pages a report 
that Palestinian Authority President Abbas and Israeli Premier 
Olmert will meet on September 16 to discuss, "among many peace 
process issues," proposed compensation for "Jewish settlers" who 
would voluntarily move from their West Bank homes. 
 
Al-Quds front-pages several stories quoting international leaders 
condemning Israeli West Bank settlement activities.  Spanish Foreign 
Minister Moratinos, who visited Ramallah on September 14, is 
reported describing the expansion of settlements as an "obstacle" to 
any future agreement between the two sides.  Jordan's King Abdullah 
and EU foreign policy chief Solana are also quoted criticizing 
Israeli settlement activities in the West Bank.  In related 
reporting from the weekend, Palestinian Authority President Abbas 
told the press after his meeting with Moratinos that, "We will ask 
the new US administration to support the peace process immediately 
after it is elected."  Abbas also held weekend meetings with 
Norwegian Special Coordinator for the Middle East and Special Envoy 
of the Russian President on September 13, according to weekend 
coverage. 
 
Al-Ayyam quotes Bassam Zakarnah, head of the union for Palestinian 
Authority (PA) employees, confirming that the PA has agreed to pay 
employees their September salaries and 50 percent of their benefits 
by the end of the month. 
 
The closure of all Gaza crossings by the Israeli Government is 
highlighted in all dailies.  Citing a statement issued by Israeli 
Defense Minister Barak's office, reports state that the closure is a 
response to the September 14 firing of a missile from the Gaza Strip 
on the Israeli town of Sderot.

Weekend stories 
--------------- 
 
Sunday, September 14, 2008 
 
Al-Quds led with comments by an American expert from the 
conservative Washington think tank, Foundation for Defense of 
Democracies, regarding a probable Israeli attack on Iran.  The 
 
JERUSALEM 00001716  002 OF 003 
 
 
expert notes that the "ideal" time for a strike would be after the 
November presidential elections, during the transition between 
administrations.  If Barack Obama wins, the likelihood of an Israeli 
strike is higher than if John McCain wins because of Obama's and 
Biden's "appeasement policies" towards Iran and "less favorable 
views" of Israel, according to the story that first appeared in Gulf 
dailies. 
 
All dailies report on the killing and injuring of West Bank 
Palestinians by Israelis.  Front pages highlighted that armed 
"Jewish settlers" attacked the Nablus area village of Asira 
Al-Qibliya after a Palestinian intruder stabbed and lightly wounded 
an Israeli boy in an "illegal Jewish outpost."  Al-Ayyam leads with 
news of the killing of a Palestinian teenager by Israeli Defense 
Forces near Bethlehem on September 13. 
 
Palestinian Authority (PA) Premier, Salam Fayyad was shown on front 
pages feeding a little girl at an orphanage in Hebron during a 
September 13 Iftar.  In remarks, Fayyad again called for an end to 
internal Palestinian division and reunification according to the 
plan proposed by PA President Abbas. 
 
Saturday, September 13, 2008 
 
Front pages showed photos of worshipers performing the second Friday 
prayers of Ramadan at Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque and throngs of 
other worshipers who were prevented from entering Jerusalem, 
standing behind the Qalandiya checkpoint near the West Bank city of 
Ramallah.  The three dailies highlighted that more than 100,000 
Palestinian worshipers performed the Friday prayers at Al-Aqsa, 
despite strict Israeli procedures imposed at West Bank checkpoints. 
 
 
 
All dailies led with a September 12 interview by Palestinian 
Authority President Abbas with Israeli daily Ha'aretz.  Abbas raised 
doubts over the possibility of an early peace agreement before 
December and emphasized that the U.S. plays a central role in the 
peace process.  He added that Israel must discuss (in negotiations) 
both its responsibility for the refugee problem and a practical 
solution to the right of return.  "Palestinians who do not return to 
Israel will be able to return to Palestine, "the Palestinian leader 
further commented.  The complete interview was published on the 
inside pages of the three dailies.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------ 
¶1.  Independent Al-Quds runs its main editorial under the title, 
"Partition on the Basis of International Legitimacy"(09/15): "in a 
statement seldom made by Israeli leaders, Premier Ehud Olmert said 
[on September 14] in an address to his government, that the dream of 
Greater Israel has ended [forever] and that maintaining otherwise is 
self-delusion, adding that this land must be divided [between Israel 
and] the Palestinians if Israel does not want to become a 
bi-national state.  With this, Olmert clarified vital issues but 
also raised many questions... The strange thing about this position 
is the justification that Olmert offers for... the need to divide 
the land with the Palestinians - not in the interest of peace, 
security, or the welfare and prosperity of both peoples - but mainly 
because of his desire that Israel not become a bi-national state and 
remain a Jewish state, completely ignoring the rights of the Israeli 
minority [of Palestinians] living within the green line... Is [the 
proposed partition] the same partition of historical Palestine [1948 
 
JERUSALEM 00001716  003 OF 003 
 
 
borders] per international resolutions?... If the dream of Greater 
Jerusalem has vanished from the minds of Israeli leaders, they 
should seek to implement legitimate international resolutions and 
not to impose a new division that can never be a basis for peace, 
security or stability in the region". 
 
¶2.  Under the title "Has the Exception Become the Rule?" regular 
columnist Talal Okal opines in independent Al-Ayyam: "[t]he 
Palestinian negotiating team should have agreed to [conduct] a media 
campaign to expose the Israeli policies that are responsible for the 
failure of negotiations... Palestinians should take into account the 
role of international variables that are moving us towards a 
multi-polar world in which Russia will play a critical role... [and 
the EU will play a greater role], especially in Arab-Israeli peace 
negotiations, including Palestinian-Israeli negotiations. 
Negotiations have reached their final phase, for it is not expected 
that the current American administration will be capable of 
continuing [the process].  Probably, the September 26 meeting 
between Bush and [PA President] Abbas is the final attempt."
