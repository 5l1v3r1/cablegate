¶1. (SBU) Summary:  On September 4, Beja Congress Executive Committee 
members requested USG capacity building and media training support 
as their organization transitions from an armed opposition movement 
to a civil political party.  They echoed reports of impending famine 
in the East in the near future.  Expressing appreciation for past 
USG humanitarian aid, they hoped that the USG would play a larger 
role in aid and development in the East going forward.  CDA 
Fernandez welcomed the Beja Congress party's maturation, urged its 
leaders to build networks with other like-minded organizations 
across Sudan, noted USG hopes to establish a development program in 
the East, and encouraged the Beja Congress party to stay in close 
contact with the Embassy.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On September 4, members of the Beja Congress Executive 
Committee called on CDA Fernandez to brief him on the August 15 
general conference of the Beja Congress in Erkowait and on the 
humanitarian and development needs of the East.  They were Salah 
Barkwin, the Eastern Front Secretary of Kassala State whom CDA 
Fernandez met on May 4 in Kassala (Reftel A); Abdalla Musa, Member 
of the National Council and Beja Congress Spokesman; and Al-Amin 
Shingrai, who has spent much of the last decade in exile in the 
United States before returning to Sudan upon the signing of the 
Eastern Sudan Peace Agreement (ESPA). 
 
"A NEW ERA" FOR BEJA CONGRESS PARTY 
----------------------------------- 
¶3. (SBU) Barkwin described the Beja Congress general conference in 
Erkowait as "very successful," noting that it was broadly attended 
not just by Beja but all groups of the East. Despite its name and 
historical roots, he characterized the Beja Congress as an inclusive 
party whose membership is open to all. He stated that while the Beja 
Congress is a member of the Government of National Unity (GNU) 
through the Eastern Front, it was not allied with the NCP. "We have 
our own views," stated Barkwin.  "We are also allied with our old 
friends in the South, in Darfur, and in the North," referring to the 
Beja Congress' erstwhile allies in the now defunct umbrella 
opposition group National Democratic Alliance (NDA). 
 
¶4.  (SBU) CDA Fernandez agreed that party alliances are constructive 
and encouraged the Beja Congress to build networks with other 
like-minded organizations across Sudan.  He asked whether an SPLM 
alliance with the DUP precludes one with the Eastern Front. 
Shingrai replied that this is to some extent true, given the 
historical animosity between the DUP and Beja Congress as both fight 
over the same geographic base. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Echoing Eastern Front and Beja Congress Chairman Musa 
Mohamed Ahmed (Ref. B), Shingrai stated that the Beja Congress is 
now in a "new era" as a civil political party after years as an 
armed opposition movement. "We must manage the struggle in a civil 
way," he said.  Noting the Beja Congress' long history of good 
relations with the USG and Embassy Khartoum, he urged the USG to 
help the party with this transformation through capacity building 
and media training assistance. "We need to remake the party from 
what it was to what we want it to be," he said. CDA Fernandez stated 
that in advance of the 2009 elections, the USG remains focused on 
training and capacity building for democratic forces in Sudan, 
especially those representing marginalized people. He encouraged the 
Beja Congress to stay in close contact with the Embassy and work 
with like-minded organizations throughout Sudan. 
 
ECHOING REPORTS OF FAMINE IN THE EAST 
------------------------------------- 
¶6. (SBU) The Beja Congress leaders expressed appreciation for 
humanitarian aid provided by the USG over the years, including the 
years of armed struggle.  But they urged that the USG ramp up both 
humanitarian and development aid for the East. They echoed previous 
reports (Ref C) of a dire shortage of food in the region, notably in 
Kassala and Red Sea states.  "The last harvest was very weak" due to 
a lack of rain, stated Barkwin, noting that the East also had to 
contend with the annual Gash River flash floods.  He stated that the 
price of sorghum remains high, and while the State Government in 
Kassala tried to import sorghum from other parts of Sudan, the 
result was inadequate due to the state's limited financial 
resources. "It is not enough," he said.  Shingrai declared that 
unless the international community provides food aid and the GOS 
declares a state of emergency, then "starvation is a probable 
consequence." They feared that the ruling NCP is downplaying the 
serious consequences of hunger in the East for political reasons.

¶7. (SBU) CDA Fernandez agreed that it is an unfortunate reality that 
the East does not receive the attention it deserves.  He 
characterized the humanitarian situation as a "slow motion crisis" 
that does not capture the attention of the world in the way as the 
Darfur conflict, or even the CPA.  However, he added that USAID is 
seeking to establish a development program for Northern Sudan, 
including the East. This would be the first USG-funded development 
program in the East in many years. CDA Fernandez pointed out that 
improved relations with the GOS are a necessary prerequisite to 
increased development aid, as the regime has typically viewed 
outside involvement in Eastern Sudan with suspicion.  He noted that 
on his trip to Kassala in May (Ref. A) all meetings with political 
parties were attended by a NISS representative, a level of 
monitoring not seen elsewhere in Sudan. Shingrai expressed hope that 
this might change, observing that "the regime has too many problems 
in Darfur and in the South, so we expect they won't give us a hard 
time." 
 
Comment 
------- 
¶8. (SBU) Unlike Dr. Amna Dirar, whose leadership challenge of Musa 
Mohamed Ahmed in the Eastern Front remains unresolved (Ref. D), the 
Beja Congress leadership does not seem to view membership in either 
organization as mutually exclusive.  Rather, they seem to view the 
Eastern Front simply as a vehicle to promote the agenda of the Beja 
Congress.  Whether either organization will be a force in the 2009 
elections depends largely on whether they can successfully establish 
electoral alliances.  An alliance with the SPLM would be intriguing, 
but is hampered by the SPLM's indecision as to whether it will mount 
a serious national election campaign against the NCP or make a deal 
with them.  Post will continue to encourage such alliances and reach 
out to democratic forces in advance of the elections, especially 
those representing marginalized populations.  Although reports of 
famine in the East may be premature, it is Sudan's poorest region 
and Post will continue to monitor the situation closely.
