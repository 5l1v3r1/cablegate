SUBJECT: TRAVEL WARNING - YEMEN 
 
¶1. This Travel Warning updates information on security 
incidents in Yemen and reminds U.S. citizens of the high 
security threat level in Yemen due to terrorist 
activities.  The Department of State 
has authorized the departure of non-emergency personnel 
and eligible family members of the U.S. Embassy in 
Sana'a. 
The Department recommends that American citizens defer 
non-essential travel to Yemen.  U.S. citizens remaining 
in Yemen despite this warning should monitor the U.S. 
Embassy website at http://yemen.usembassy.gov and should 
make contingency emergency plans.  This supersedes the 
Travel Warning for Yemen issued August 13, 2008. 
 
¶2. The security threat level remains high due to 
terrorist activities in Yemen.  On September 17 at 
approximately 9:15 a.m. local time, armed terrorists 
attacked the U.S. Embassy in Sana'a, Yemen.  A number of 
explosions occurred in the vicinity of the Embassy's main 
gate.  Several Yemeni security personnel were killed, as 
were a few individuals waiting to gain entry to the 
Embassy. 
¶3. U.S. embassy employees have been advised to exercise 
caution when choosing restaurants, hotels or visiting 
tourist areas in Sana'a in order to avoid large 
gatherings of foreigners and expatriates.  In addition, 
unofficial travel outside of the capital is not 
authorized at this time. 
¶4. U.S. citizens who travel to or remain in Yemen despite 
this warning should exercise caution and take prudent 
security measures, including maintaining a high level of 
vigilance, avoiding crowds and demonstrations, keeping a 
low profile, varying times and routes for all travel, and 
ensuring travel documents are current.  U.S. citizens in 
Yemen are advised to exercise particular caution at 
locations frequented by foreigners countrywide including 
restaurants and hotels.  From time to time, the Embassy 
may restrict official Americans from restaurants, hotels, 
or shopping areas.  The Department of State strongly 
encourages U.S. citizens to consult the most recent 
Warden Messages 
(http://yemen.usembassy.gov/service.html) 
 to get up-to-date information on security conditions. 
U.S. citizens who believe they are being followed or 
threatened while driving in urban centers should proceed 
as quickly as possible to the nearest police station or 
major intersection and request assistance from the 
officers in the blue-and-white police cars stationed 
there. 
¶5. The Department remains concerned about possible 
attacks by extremist individuals or groups against U.S. 
citizens, facilities, businesses, and perceived 
interests.  On January 17, 2008, suspected al-Qa'ida 
operatives ambushed a tourist convoy in the eastern 
Hadramout Governorate, killing two Belgians.  On July 2, 
2007, suspected al-Qa'ida operatives carried out a 
vehicle-borne explosive device attack on tourists at the 
Belquis Temple in Marib, which resulted in the deaths of 
eight Spanish tourists and two Yemenis.  The targeting of 
tourist sites by al-Qa'ida may represent an escalation in 
terror tactics in Yemen.  On February 3, 2006, 23 
convicts, including known affiliates of al-Qa'ida, 
escaped from a high-security prison in the capital city, 
Sana'a, some of whom remain at large.  Two of the 
escapees were later killed in vehicle-based suicide 
attacks on oil facilities near Mukalla and Marib on 
September 15, 2006.  Those attacks were followed by the 
arrest the next day in Sana'a of four suspected al Qa'ida 
operatives, who had stockpiled explosives and weapons. 
¶6. Since January 2007, the Government of Yemen has been 
battling al Houthi rebels in and around the northern 
governorate of Saada.  While foreigners have not been 
 
STATE 00099734  002 OF 002 
 
 
targeted, hundreds of soldiers and civilians have been 
killed in the violence.  U.S. citizens traveling in Yemen 
should be aware that local authorities occasionally place 
restrictions on the travel of foreigners to parts of the 
country experiencing unrest.  In addition, the U.S. 
Embassy itself often restricts travel of official 
personnel to the tribal areas north and east of Sana'a, 
such as the governorates of Amran, Al Jawf, Hajja, Marib, 
Saada, and Shabwa.  Travelers should be in contact with 
the Embassy for up-to-date information on such 
restrictions. 
¶7. U.S. citizens should register at the Consular Section 
of the U.S. Embassy in Sana'a and enroll in the warden 
system (emergency alert network) to obtain updated 
information on travel and security in Yemen.  This can be 
done online prior to arrival in Yemen at 
https://travelregistration.state.gov/ibrs. 
¶8. The U.S. Embassy is located at Dhahr Himyar Zone, 
Sheraton Hotel District, P.O. Box 22347.  The telephone 
number of the Consular Section is (967) (1) 755-2000, 
extension 2153 or 2266. The fax number is (967) (1) 303- 
¶175.  The after-hours emergency number is (967) (1) 755- 
2000 (press zero for extension) or (967) 733213509.  From 
time to time the Embassy may temporarily close or suspend 
public services for security reasons.  Emergency 
assistance to U.S. citizens during non-business hours (or 
when public access is restricted) is available through 
Embassy duty personnel. 
¶9. Current information on travel and security in Yemen 
may be obtained from the Department of State by calling 
1-888-407-4747 within the United States and Canada or, 
from outside the United States and Canada, 1-202-501- 
¶4444.  U.S. citizens should consult the Country Specific 
Information for Yemen and the Worldwide Caution on the 
Department's Internet site at http://travel.state.gov. 
Up-to-date information on security conditions can also be 
addressed at http://yemen.usembassy.gov/service.html.
