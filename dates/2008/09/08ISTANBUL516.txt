¶1. (SBU)  SUMMARY:  Sadrettin Karaduman, Saadet Party (SP) 
Istanbul Party Chairman spoke longingly about past glory 
days when his party controlled the city's administration. 
Karaduman credited mayors from SP's previous political 
organizations --  Welfare (Refah) Party (RP) and Felicity 
(Fazilet) Party (FP), for major improvements in the city's 
infrastructure. Karaduman failed to give credit to RP's most 
notable former mayor, Prime Minister Erdogan. Despite being 
out of government, SP can still bring out a crowd, Karaduman 
argued, such as when SP organized protests against the Pope's 
visit in 2006. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) During a September 5 meeting with us, Karaduman 
waxed nostalgic about the glory days when RP and FP -- the 
predecessors to SP -- controlled the mayor's office for 
greater Istanbul. Karaduman was joined by SP Deputy for 
Foreign Affairs Mustafa Kaya and two other party officials. 
Karaduman credited his previous party's administration for 
improvements to Istanbul's infrastructure, particularly 
expanding the city's transportation and water systems. 
Karaduman claimed it is this solid history of good governance 
that will bring SP bring back into power in the local 
elections scheduled for March 2009. Not surprisingly, 
Karaduman failed to give any credit to former RP mayor and 
now PM Erdogan, leader of the rival AKP. Instead, Karaduman 
blamed AKP for harming Turkey's economy, particularly for 
driving up the current account deficit and high unemployment. 
Karaduman, however, failed to make any specific policy 
distinctions between SP and the AKP, relying on general 
statements to lay out the failings of his former political 
partners. 
 
------------------------------------ 
The Party Can Bring Out the Faithful 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶3. (SBU) Karaduman highlighted SP's ability to bring its 
supporters to the streets. He told us SP has numerous 
grassroots supporters eager to support the party and come out 
en masse upon demand. (COMMENT: Tens of thousands of 
protestors attended a SP rally opposing the Pope's visit to 
Istanbul in 2006. Also in 2006 SP held rallies in Istanbul 
criticizing Israeli policies towards the Palestinians and 
protesting the "Danish cartoon," both of which drew thousands 
of demonstrators. END COMMENT) Responding to our question, 
Karaduman stated the Izmir branch independently organized 
their own anti-Israeli rally last spring, without approval 
from the national organization.  This is one of SP's 
strengths, according to Karaduman.  Its local leaders are 
able to take the initiative on their own.  Karaduman said SP 
rewards such proactively, promoting local organizers who work 
hard and demonstrate they have broad appeal. 
 
---------------------------- 
No Compromise on Headscarves 
---------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Karaduman was disappointed by the Constitutional 
Court's decision upholding the ban on headscarves in 
universities.  He regards wearing headscarves as a basic 
right, just as is a university education for women. 
Karaduman told us the court's verdict will simply perpetuate 
this injustice, forcing this issue to come up again in the 
future.  Karaduman acknowledged the issue is divisive in 
Turkey, yet he did not see any compromise that SP could 
accept. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Still Milli Gorus Despite Different Party Names 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶5. (SBU) In a rare show of support for AKP, Karaduman 
criticized the practice of banning political parties in 
Turkey.  Karadumen argued that the recent attempt to ban AKP 
is evidence that Turkey's political system is not truly 
democratic.  The biggest blows to Turkish democracy, he said, 
were the bans of RP and FP, as well as the so-called 
"post-modern coup" conducted by the military in 1998 against 
then Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, the leader of RP. 
Deputy Chairman Mustafa Kaya, told us the political parties 
RP, FP, and SP are actually all part of the same Milli Gorus 
 
ISTANBUL 00000516  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
movement.  The political parties are expendable arms, he 
said, that can be disposed of without harming the core 
organization. Kaya said it is unfortunate that Milli Gorus 
needs to play this charade, but that it is necessary given 
the limited freedom in the current political system. 
(Comment: While Erbankan established the Milli Gorus movement 
in 1975, not all of its members aligned themselves with SP. 
Most notably, AKP has a sizable Milli Gorus wing (reftel). 
End Comment.) 
 
¶6. (SBU) Kaya insisted the English translation for Milli 
Gorus ("National View") is confusing since it falsely 
labels the party as nationalist.  Kaya stressed Milli Gorus's 
focus is worldwide and should not be associated with 
nationalism, especially the ultra-nationalist National Action 
Party (MHP). Throughout our meeting, Karaduman, 
Kaya, and the other party members stressed that SP's aim is 
global: it hopes to assist the entire world's population, by 
promoting world peace and social justice. 
 
¶7. (SBU) COMMENT: SP's political efforts  appear directed 
more towards stirring up its grassroots supporters rather 
than winning elections. Support for the party typically falls 
in the low single digits in the national polls.  It is not 
viewed as a serious contender in Istanbul in the upcoming 
local elections.  The party's ability to fill the streets on 
a particular issue on short notice, however, can certainly 
draw the public's attention.
