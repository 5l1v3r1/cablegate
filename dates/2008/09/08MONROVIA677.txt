REF: STATE 90978 
 
¶1. PolOff met with Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs for 
International Cooperation and Economic Integration Conmany Wesseh 
August 29 to deliver reftel demarche.  Wesseh said that to his 
knowledge there had been no internal GOL discussions as of yet on 
formulating a position with respect to Russia's recognition of 
Abkhazia and South Ossetia and that Liberia would arrive at a 
position in conjunction with its ECOWAS partners. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Wesseh, who was just nominated to be Liberia's Permanent 
Representative to the United Nations, said he personally was very 
concerned about the "old Cold War rhetoric being thrown around on 
both sides" and hoped that the new international order would not be 
threatened.  He said his personal opinion was that the international 
community should take care not to "disrespect mighty Russia" in a 
way that would encourage it to make alliances with terrorist 
states. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Wesseh said that Liberia has not done much at all to engage 
Russia as a development partner but that he personally would not be 
averse to doing so in the future.
