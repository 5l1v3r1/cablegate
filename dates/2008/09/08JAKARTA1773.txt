Jakarta 15, September 2008 
 
Dr. Rice, 
 
We in Indonesia share the grief of the American people in the 
wake of the tragedy inflicted by Hurricane Ike as it swept 
across the states of Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas. 
 
Our prayers are with the victims of the disaster. 
 
We are confident, however, that the great American nation 
will very soon recover and grow even stronger as it weathers 
the impact of this debacle. 
 
Accept, Excellency, the assurances of my highest esteem. 
 
Dr. N. Hassan Wirajuda 
 
Her Excellency 
Dr. Condoleezza Rice 
Secretary of State of the United States of America 
Washington D.C.
