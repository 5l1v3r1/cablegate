Canada plans to pledge approximately C$10 million in aid to 
Georgia at the Brussels donor conference in October, 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) 
Eastern Europe and Balkans Division Senior Desk Officer 
Curtis Peters told Econcouns.  Canada has not finalized its 
pledge details nor the members of its delegation, Peters 
said.  He added that if the conference occurs just after 
Canada's October 14 national elections, it may preclude 
Canadian ministerial representation in Brussels.
