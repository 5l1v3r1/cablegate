COMPLIANCE RESOLUTION 
 
REF: STATE 101817 
 
¶1. Poloff discussed the U.S. UNGA First Committee resolution 
on compliance with nonproliferation, arms limitations and 
disarmament agreements with MFA Head of UN Division Azzedine 
Farhane on September 26.  Farhane said that Morocco will 
certainly support the resolution. 
 
¶2. When asked if Morocco would co-sponsor the draft 
resolution, Farhane explained that it may depend upon the 
actions of the Arab League and Organization of the Islamic 
Conference (OIC).  He indicated that Morocco will encourage 
their constituencies in the OIC and Africa Group to give 
their support. 
 
¶3. Farhane suggested that the United States engage those 10 
countries who abstained from the 2005 compliance resolution 
vote and actively seek their full support.  Farhane opined 
that he hoped this resolution would pass by consensus and 
agreed to forward details of the draft resolution to the 
Foreign Minister.
