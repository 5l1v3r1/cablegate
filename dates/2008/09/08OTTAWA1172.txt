SUBJECT: CANADA WILL DISCUSS BRAZIL'S PARTICIPATION IN PDG 
IN STEERING COMMITTEE 
 
Classified By: Acting PolMinCouns Kurt van der Walde, 
reason 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C) Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade 
(DFAIT) Policy Planning officer Helen Fytche told poloff 
September 4 that Canada would be pleased to discuss Brazil's 
participation in the Partnership for Democratic Governance 
(PDG) at the October 17 Steering Group meeting.  Canada felt 
this was the most appropriate venue to discuss the topic, 
said Fytche.  Canadian International Development Agency 
(CIDA) Director General in the Office of Democratic 
Governance Adair Heuchan will lead Canada's delegation to the 
meeting.  Fytche added that she had shared the demarche with 
DFAIT's Brazil desk, and stated that DFAIT was continuing to 
hold constructive discussions on the future of the PDG. 
 
¶2. (C) A PDG delegation met recently with the Canadian High 
Commissioner in South Africa, said Fytche, and asked for 
Canadian assistance in urging South Africa to serve as a PDG 
observer.  Canada supports South Africa's participation as an 
observer, but is being careful not to apply too much pressure 
on South Africa since Canada believes South Africa is 
reluctant to take on that role, said Fytche.
