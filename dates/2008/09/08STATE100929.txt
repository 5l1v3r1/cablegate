¶3.  (C) SUMMARY:  Assistant Secretary Shannon met with 
Panamanian Ambassador Federico Humbert on September 9, 2008. 
Humbert, who requested the meeting, previewed Panamanian 
President Martin Torrijos' September 15-17 visit to 
Washington, intended to encourage Congressional approval of 
the U.S.-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement (TPA).  Ambassador 
Humbert stated President Torrijos was under great pressure to 
secure U.S. Congressional approval of the TPA before he 
leaves office in May 2009, and hoped to secure it during a 
lame duck session.  Humbert briefly discussed the extradition 
of Manuel Noriega, stating that Panama does not welcome his 
return and encouraging his speedy extradition elsewhere.  He 
stated Panama was hesitant to recognize Kosovo while 
condemning Russia's actions in Georgia on behalf of breakaway 
regions, despite the differences between the two situations. 
End Summary. 
 
TORRIJOS' LAST PUSH ON TPA 
-------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (C) Ambassador Humbert stated this will be President 
Torrijos' last visit to Washington during his presidency, and 
that it will be difficult for him to return to Panama without 
a plan for moving forward on the U.S.-Panama TPA.  He noted 
he had received mixed messages from within the Administration 
regarding the possibility of submitting the Panama TPA to 
Congress before the approval of the U.S.-Colombia TPA. 
However, he stated President Torrijos did not want to stand 
in the way of the Colombia TPA.  Torrijos understands the 
Panama TPA may not be approved until after Colombia, Humbert 
said, but requests that the Administration submit the Panama 
TPA as soon as possible.  He added that Panama &has the 
votes8 needed to gain Congressional approval, that 
substantive labor issues have been addressed, and that former 
National Assembly President Pedro Miguel Gonzalez is no 
longer in office.  (Comment:  Gonzalez was indicted in the 
United States for the 1992 murder of one U.S. serviceman and 
attempted murder of another.  Members of Congress have cited 
Gonzalez, position as National Assembly President as the 
major obstacle to considering the Panama TPA.  End Comment.) 
 
¶5.  (C) Humbert stated Torrijos understands that U.S. 
domestic politics play a significant role in the timing of 
Congressional submission and approval, and Torrijos does not 
expect the Panama TPA to be submitted before the U.S. general 
election.  The GOP is hopeful the TPA will be approved during 
a lame duck session between the election and the inauguration 
in January.  Humbert noted the GOP has already reached out to 
the Obama and McCain campaigns to advocate for the TPA.  A/S 
Shannon noted the Administration's continued support for 
Congressional approval of the Panama TPA, and stated that 
while he also hoped for a lame duck session, it was not clear 
whether Congress will hold one. 
 
RETURN OF NORIEGA TO PANAMA WOULD BE A REAL HEADACHE 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶6.  (C) Humbert stated the return of Manuel Noriega to Panama 
would be "a real headache" that the GOP did not welcome. 
He also noted Noriega's possible return would arise as an 
issue in Panama's upcoming presidential election.  &The 
sooner he leaves the States, the better,8 Humbert said, 
requesting the USG ensure that Noriega,s extradition 
elsewhere occurs as quickly as possible. 
 
PANAMA HESITANT TO ACT ON KOSOVO, GEORGIA 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (C) Humbert stated that because the GOP had been 
"hitting Russia hard" on Georgia, now was not the right 
time to recognize Kosovo.  Not recognizing Kosovo, he said, 
gives the GOP firmer ground to stand on at the UN when 
dealing with Russia.  A/S Shannon distinguished recognition 
of Kosovo from the issue of the breakaway regions of South 
Ossetia and Abkhazia, noting that while Kosovo's independence 
was a result of a comprehensive UN process, Russia,s actions 
in Georgia were inconsistent with UN Security Council 
resolutions and international law.  A/S Shannon noted that he 
looked forward to further discussing this issue with 
Panamanian Vice President and Foreign Minister Samuel Lewis 
during President Torrijos, visit to Washington. 
 
¶8.  (C) A/S Shannon stated Nicaragua would pay a high price 
for its recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and 
Humbert responded that Ortega was merely continuing to 
isolate himself.  A/S Shannon stated while Nicaragua was 
attempting to curry favor with Russia and emulate Venezuela, 
re-introducing a relationship of Russian patronage with 
Nicaragua would be very negative for the hemisphere.  He 
noted that in light of Nicaragua's action, the USG will have 
to reconsider all aspects of our bilateral relationship, 
including Nicaragua,s Millennium Challenge Compact.
