REF: STATE 97316 
 
 ¶1.  On September 12, Econoff delivered reftel demarche and 
nonpaper concerning the OFAC designations of Venezuelan 
officials under the Kingpin Act to Iago Lossada in the MFA,s 
International Counter-Terrorism Directorate.  Econoff 
subsequently shared the information with Conchita Cornejo 
Garcia of the Finance Ministry,s Treasury and Financial 
Policy Directorate. 
 
¶2.  In a September 17 follow-up conversation, Lossada 
indicated that he had shared the information concerning the 
designated individuals with appropriate GOS agencies and 
authorities.  He noted that he was unable to provide a 
response until he received comments back from these agencies 
and did not know if the GOS would be able to share 
information on the designees.  GOS policy is to implement UN 
and EU designations only, and therefore not U.S. domestic 
designations.  However, Lossada was grateful for the 
information and encouraged Econoff to continue sharing 
advance designation notices and the valuable background 
information on prospective designees for Spanish law 
enforcement purposes.  Post will follow up and report any GOS 
response.
