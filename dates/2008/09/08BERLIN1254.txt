NICARAGUAN RECOGNITION OF SOUTH OSSETIA AND ABKHAZIA

S: 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
 
Â¶1. (C) On 12 September 2008, POLOFFs delivered reftel 
demarche to Christiane Botschen, Deputy Director for Mexico, 
Central America, and the Caribbean at the German Foreign 
Office.  Botschen informed POLOFFs that Germany and the EU 
shared the same concerns as the United States about 
Nicaragua's recent recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, 
and were planning to deliver a Troika level demarche to the 
Nicaraguan Government in Managua.  The demarche is being 
prepared in Brussels by the EU working group on Latin America 
and the Caribbean, and is expected to be delivered following 
their next meeting on 16 September.  Botschen added that the 
EU is also considering a less formal, discreet demarche to 
other Latin America states, possibly Bolivia and Venezuela, 
whom they suspect may also recognize South Ossetia and 
Abkhazia.  Botschen admitted that while Nicaragua's 
recognition is "unacceptable" to the EU and Germany, there is 
little the EU could do to make President Daniel Ortega 
reverse his position.
