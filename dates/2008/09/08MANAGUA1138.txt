REF: MANAGUA 1124 
 
¶1. (U) On September 5, the Ortega Administration issued 
Decrees 46 and 47, extending full diplomatic recognition to 
its "sisters," the Republic of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. 
The decrees recognize the independence of the two 
"republics," welcomes them into the "community of independent 
nations of the world," and directs the Foreign Ministry to 
take all necessary steps to consummate the recognition by 
establishing "full diplomatic relations." The Decrees were 
signed by Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega and Acting 
Foreign Minister Manuel Coronel Kautz.  Copies of the decrees 
have been sent to STATE/WHA. 
 
¶2. (U) Nicaragua media reported that on September 4, Russian 
Ambassador Igor Kondrashev met with the Chair of the National 
Assembly's Foreign Affairs Committee, Jamileth Bonilla, to 
discuss the situation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. 
Kondrashev "welcomed" the decision of Ortega to recognize the 
"two regions."  Bonilla, a former opposition leader who now 
claims to be independent but tends to vote with the Ortega 
government, noted her opposition to Ortega but "applauded" 
the decision to recognizing, noting that it would "contribute 
to peace."  Nicaraguan radio is reporting that other Latin 
American nations are praising Ortega's "leadership" on 
recognition and that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and 
Cuba's Raul Castro have called Ortega to congratulate his 
move. 
 
¶3. (U) Opposition leaders have begun to criticize Ortega's 
decision.  Constitutional Liberal Party (PLC) spokesman 
Leonel Teller issued a press release lamenting the decision 
and Ortega's "continued alienation" of Nicaragua from 
countries that can help and establishment of alliances with 
countries from whom Nicaragua has "nothing to gain, ... such 
as these countries protected by Russia."  National Assembly 
Deputy and Chair of the Defense Committee, Enrique Quinonez 
commented that Ortega rushed to recognize because "he wants 
to be world leader and is looking to start another Cold War."
