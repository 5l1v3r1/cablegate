REF: A. 07 ANKARA 1578 
     ¶B. ANKARA 1471 
 
 ¶1. On August 28, after more than a year of delay, Turkey 
finally deposited its instruments of accession for the WIPO 
Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms 
Treaty with the WIPO in Geneva, with no reservations.  The 
treaty will enter into force on November 28, 2008. As 
reported in ref A, Turkey ratified the two treaties on May 8, 
2007 and expected to formally join in July of that year. 
 
¶2. Although the process took much longer than anticipated, 
the entry into force of the two so-called "Internet" treaties 
is yet another positive step in Turkey,s IPR enforcement 
regime.  Taken together with the positive new programs 
outlined in ref B, it helps to move forward the GOT's stated 
intention of improving IPR protections and aligning Turkey's 
laws with international standards.
