INFORMATION 
 
REF:  STATE 94522 
 
¶1.  Per REFTEL, Post's officers responsible for handling requests 
for marine scientific research authorizations are as follows: 
 
-  Environment, Science, Technology and Health (ESTH) Counselor 
Richard J. Driscoll - tel. 55 61 3312-7401, email 
DriscollRJ@state.gov (through summer 2010) 
 
-  ESTH Officer Jeremy W. Long - tel. 55 61-3312-7432

-  ESTH Assistant Daisy B. da Costa - tel. 55 61 3312-7432, email: 
CostaDBD@state.gov 
 
¶2.  The ESTH Office has obtained updated information from the 
Brazilian Ministry of External Relations' (MRE) Division of Oceans, 
Antarctic and Space (DMAE).about authorizations for marine 
scientific research in Brazilian waters.  DMAE's Secretary Ronaldo 
Lima Vieira explained that requests for authorization should be 
submitted at least one hundred and eighty (180) days in advance. 
DMAE requires two forms to be submitted with the diplomatic note 
requesting the authorization.  These are:  (1) the marine research 
authorization form required by the Brazilian Navy and (2) the radio 
frequency form required by the National Telecommunication Agency (or 
ANATEL - Agencia Nacional de Telecomunicacao).  The current versions 
of these forms have been sent to OES/OA. 
 
¶3.  The radio frequency authorization form is written in both 
Portuguese and English.  The Navy authorization form, however, is 
only in Portuguese; a translated version of that form has been sent 
to OES/OA.  Both forms can be completed in English and sent to the 
Embassy's ESTH office, which will translate them into Portuguese for 
submission to the Brazilian authorities, which insist on Portuguese 
versions. 
 
¶4.  The MRE emphasized that it needs all the detailed information 
requested on the forms.
