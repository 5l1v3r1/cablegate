In Today's Papers 
 
Retired General Detained in Ergenekon Investigation Released 
All papers report retired General Eruygur, who suffered a cerebral 
hemorrhage after falling down stairs at Kandira hospital, was 
released from prison on Sunday for health reasons. 
Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet's headline reads "Former General in 
Coma Released from Prison" and reports that Eruygur was waiting 
trial in the Ergenekon case and was hospitalized five days ago after 
he fell down the stairs at Kandira prison.  Doctors said Eruygur is 
still in critical condition, adds the paper.  Meanwhile, liberal 
Radikal reports that four lieutenants and a military student who 
last week were detained in the Ergenekon investigation have been 
formerly arrested while lawyer Levent Temiz, artist Nurseli Idiz and 
transsexual celebrity Seyhan Soylu were set free. 
 
Deniz Feneri Case and Debates in Turkey 
Media outlets continue to cover Deniz Feneri Germany case and its 
potential impact on Turkish politics.  Weekend papers predominantly 
highlighted RTUK Chairman Zahid Akman's connection to the Germany 
case.  Stories in Radikal, Milliyet, Hurriyet, Vatan as well as 
Taraf argued that there are enough reasons for Akman to announce his 
resignation.  Meanwhile mainstream Milliyet and Hurriyet noted that 
Mr. Akman is still involved in businesses as either a shareholder or 
board member,despite restrictions set out in the law for RTUK 
Chairs's involvement in commercial interests.  Monday papers carry a 
statement from Zahid Akman, sent to media through his lawyer to deny 
the charges.  The statement says, the allegations against Akman are 
baseless because all of his commercial assets were acquired prior to 
his assuming the RTUK Chairmanship position. "Moreover there is no 
regulation mentioned in the RTUK chairman's responsibility banning 
him from being a shareholder" the statement added. 
 
Papers also highlight Parliament Speaker Toptan's follow up remarks 
on the RTUK Chairman debate.  Toptan said, in many countries 
resignation due to allegations is an established culture and he 
wished that Turkey could have the same culture.  "Resigning from a 
duty does not mean accepting allegations" he added. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Deniz Feneri Case 
 
Taha Akyol wrote in mainstream Milliyet: "Respectful British paper 
The Economist questioned the AKP's purity last week with a headline 
"Isn't the AKP pure any longer?"  Moreover, regarding PM Erdogoan's 
attacks against the media, an EU Ambassador said "Fasting must have 
made him a nervous man."  If global economic and political centers 
are becoming suspicious of the AKP, then trust in the capital 
movements will be affected as well.  Therefore, instead of 
criticizing and threatening the media, PM Erdogan should initiate an 
investigation against fraud in Turkey as well.  If he doesn't hurry 
up and clean his own garden soon, questions about the AKP's purity 
will increase." 
 
Mehmet Tezkan wrote in mainstream Vatan:  "Deniz Feneri officials 
committed a crime against humanity by stealing poor people's money. 
Through their illegal act, they damaged people's charitable feelings 
and other charity organizations' credibility as well.  The social 
angle of the incident is much stronger than the political results. 
Therefore, the resignation of Zahid Akman will not be satisfactory. 
Under these conditions, Akman is obliged to resign.  But the case 
should not end there and Akman, Zekeriya Karaman and their circle 
should be tried.  The prosecutor of the case should be the poor 
children who lost their aid money to this charity organization." 
 
U.S. Religious Freedom Report 
Milliyet, Cumhuriyet and Zaman report on Sunday the annual US State 
Department report on religious freedom says the Turkish state 
generally respects religious freedoms, but adds there are 
restrictions for Islamic and other groups.  The symbols of Islam are 
not allowed in state offices and universities, and the military

General Staff (TGS) and the National Security Council (MGK) view 
religious fundamentalism as a threat, according to the report.   It 
criticizes the Turkish government for forcing Alevi children to 
receive Sunni religious instruction in school.  It also criticizes 
Turkey for not recognizing the Ecumenical status of the Greek 
Orthodox Patriarchate, and for keeping the Halki Seminary in 
Istanbul closed.  The report also says Turkey's leading politicians 
have ties with religious communities, which are outlawed in Turkey. 
 
 
Suicide Attack against Islamabad Marriott 
Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak reports, "The Bomb Attack in Pakistan 
Also Killed the Czech Ambassador," and "Ivo Zdarek was only 
appointed to Islamabad one month ago."  Liberal Radikal calls the 
attack "Like Pakistan's September 11th," and reports, "As Bush's war 
spreads, the American Marriott Hotel is reduced to rubble in 
Pakistan," as authorities call it, "the work of Al-Qaeda." 
Islamist-oriented Zaman carries the headline, "The Prime Minister's 
Iftar Program Was Cancelled only Hours before the Explosion." 
Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet carries the headline, "The Footprints 
of Al-Qaeda in the Attack," as "all signs indicate Taliban militants 
who are on the border with Afghanistan and who are linked to 
Al-Qaeda are responsible."  Leftist Taraf reports, "Pakistan Lives 
Through Its Own September 11th."  Mainstream Sabah reports, 
"Terrorists Create a 6-meter Crater with 1 Ton of Explosives." 
 
James Jeffrey Begins Confirmation Hearings 
Far right Ortadogu reports, "Jim Jeffrey beings his official 
confirmation hearings this week," and "is being pressured by the 
American Armenian Assembly (AAA) to refer to the events of 1915 as 
'genocide.'"  In "Genocide Blackmail Against Bush's Ankara 
Ambassador," Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak reports, "the AAA wants 
Jeffrey to recognize the events as 'genocide,'" while, "Armenian 
President Serge Sargsyan called for the opening of the 
Turkish-Armenian border and for diplomatic relations."
