¶I.  BROAD ITEMS OF INTEREST TO ADVISORS AND AGENCY MANAGERS: 
 
¶A. (SBU) On August 22, the Advisor briefed officials of the 
U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission on the current 
status of Taiwan's export control system. The commissioners were 
particularly interested in Taiwan's relaxation of caps for 
investments in China by Taiwan companies, and rules related to 
export controls of semiconductors destined for China. 
 
¶B. (SBU) On August 28, the Advisor and Econoff met with officials of 
the Mainland Affairs Council of the Executive Yuan to discuss 
Taiwan's plan to relax export controls rules on semiconductor 
equipment to China.  See reftel A. 
 
II. COMPLETED ACTIONS FOR THE REPORTING PERIOD. 
 
¶A.  SITE ASSESSMENTS AND MEETINGS DURING REPORTING PERIOD: 
 
¶1. (SBU) On August 14, the Advisor met with officials of the Taiwan 
External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) to discuss trade 
promotion activities in North Korea and Burma.  TAITRA is a 
non-governmental organization funded partly by the Ministry of 
Economic Affairs (MOEA).  TAITRA works closely with the Trade 
Development Division of the  Bureau of Foreign Trade of the MOEA in 
its trade promotion activities. 
NORTH KOREA: 
(SBU)  TAITRA officials stated that the trade relationship with 
North Korea began in 2000.  At that time, Taiwan and North Korea 
formed the North Korea-Taiwan Committee for Promotion of Private 
Sector Economy and Technology.  This Committee is headed by TAITRA. 
During the initial engagement period, Taiwan visited and received 
information from the China Council for the Promotion of 
International Trade based in Jilin province of China, located just 
above North Korea. However, until recently, the Committee was fairly 
dormant in its trade promotion activities.  TAITRA organized a trade 
mission in February 2008 and in the Pyongyang International Trade 
Fair in May 2008.  The Trade Fair was attended by representatives of 
22 Taiwan companies. 
(SBU) Also in 2000, North Korean officials visited Taiwan at the 
invitation of Taiwan companies but did not meet with TAITRA. 
Following the company visit, a North Korean Government-Taiwan 
industry committee was formed, also called the North Korea-Taiwan 
Committee for Promotion of Private Sector Economy and Technology. 
As with the official committee, TAITRA officials stated that this 
committee exists in name only and has not been used to facilitate 
trade between Taiwan and North Korea.  Since then, North Korean 
Government officials have continued to visit Taiwan companies 
several times a year.  TAITRA officials added that TAITRA is not 
involved in these visits and that neither North Korean officials nor 
Taiwan company representatives have reached out to TAITRA for 
official meetings during the visits. 
(SBU) Taiwan's major import from North Korea is coal. Taiwan's major 
exports to North Korea are uncombed synthetic fiber and cotton, 
oxygen-function amino-compounds, petroleum and oils obtained from 
asphalt, electrical products and electronics. (Source: 2006 Taiwan 
trade statistics.)  As the trade relationship develops, Taiwan is 
looking at the following industries for trade promotion: mineral; 
machinery and manufacturing equipment; electrical products and 
electronics; base metal; fibers; plant oil; prepared food; animal 
products; chemicals; raw plastics and plastics products; and 
transportation vehicles.  For the manufacturing equipment sector, 
the focus would be on exports of equipment to produce toothpaste, 
soap, cosmetic containers, construction material (cement, brick, 
paint, glass) and general consumer merchandise.  North Korea has 56% 
of the world's natural magnesium carbonate deposits as well as 300 
different types of mineral deposits. TAITRA said North Korea has 
been courting Taiwan companies for form joint ventures and seeking 
other types of investments. 
(SBU) China is the leading exporter of goods to North Korea, mostly 
by companies in the North East part of China.  (The Republic of 
Korea is the leading importer of goods from North Korea, mostly 
manufactured goods from economic zones established just across the 
Demilitarized Zone.)  The fact that all travel to North Korea must 
transit through Beijing or Shenyang has worked to China's advantage. 
 China has also taken advantage of its lead position by paying lower 
than market value for commodities, such as coal, imported into 
China. This has made North Korea aggressively explore trade 
opportunities with other countries. 
(SBU) Currently, all North Korean companies are state-owned.  Since 
North Korea does not have tradable currency, barter trade is the 
main form of exchange. For example, North Korea proposed that it pay 
Taiwan companies with finished products made with the equipment 
imported from Taiwan rather than purchasing the equipment with 
currency.  Regardless of North Korea's overtures, according to 
TAITRA, it would be difficult for Taiwan companies to invest in 
North Korea until North Korea transforms its way of doing business. 
TAITRA added that establishing special economic zones for 
manufacturers and developing legal norms would be a good starting 
point in attracting foreign investments. 
(SBU) In summary, TAITRA officials said North Korea is being looked 
at as the next Vietnam in terms of establishing a manufacturing base 
for Taiwan companies.  However, North Korea has strong structural 
impediments which prohibit development of a viable, long-term trade 
relationship.  The officials emphasized that the biggest political 
hurdle for North Korea to overcome is trade restrictions imposed by 
many countries around the world.  The officials added that future 
trade development for Taiwan greatly depends on the outcome of the 
Six-Party talks. 
BURMA: 
(SBU) Taiwan has had a long trade relationship with Burma. All of 
Taiwan's investments, however, are made through third countries, 
such as Singapore and Thailand, due to political issues between 
China and Taiwan.  The officials stated that any trade activity by 
Taiwan business people is strictly controlled. Taiwan business 
people cannot use the word "Taiwan" in any document for business 
purposes.  In the past, approximately 500 Taiwan companies operated 
in Burma; now, the number has been reduced to approximately 100. 
There is only one high technology Taiwan company, a maker of optical 
lenses, in Burma.  That company's products are exported back to 
Taiwan or other countries through neighboring countries like 
Singapore and Thailand.  There is great potential for trade with 
Burma but Burma needs to change its relationship with Taiwan before 
that potential can be realized, the officials added. 
 
¶B.  BLUE LANTERN: 
 
(SBU)  One blue lantern check was conducted during the reporting 
period.  The results of the check have been reported to PM/DDTC. 
 
III. TRAINING CONDUCTED DURING REPORTING PERIOD: 
 
¶A. (SBU) From August 6-7, along with an official from ISN/CTR, the 
Advisor briefed Singapore interagency officials on changes to the 
Wassenaar Arrangement control list and U.S. implementation of those 
changes.  This was the same update provided to Taiwan officials in 
March.  See reftel B. 
 
¶B. (SBU) On August 18, the EXBS Advisor, ISN/ECC official, and a 
contractor from a Department of Energy laboratory reviewed Republic 
of Korea's YesTrade, an internet-based license processing and 
internal control system.  ISN/ECC is exploring the use of YesTrade 
as a baseline for developing an electronic license processing system 
for certain cooperating countries. 
 
III. UPCOMING TRAINING: 
 
¶A. (SBU) From September 22-26, the Advisor will be in Seoul to 
participate in the Fourth Regional Assistance and Protection Course 
for Asian States Parties hosted by the ROK and the OPCW (September 
22-24), attend an industry outreach event sponsored by the Korea 
Strategic Trade Institute (September 25), and meet with officials of 
the Ministries of Knowledge Economy and Foreign Affairs and Trade 
(September 26). 
 
¶B. (U) During mid-December, an Industry-Government Outreach program, 
implemented by the Department of Energy, is being planned in 
Taichung.  This program will follow the same format as the July 
program but for companies located in Central Taiwan.  Many machine 
tool manufacturers are located in Taichung. 
 
¶V. UPCOMING MEETINGS: 
 
¶A. (SBU) On September 4, the Advisor is scheduled to meet with 
TAITRA officials to discuss Taiwan's trade promotion activities in 
the Middle East, with a particular focus on Iran and the United Arab 
Emirates. 
 
¶B. (SBU) On September 4, the Advisor will meet with Kang Da, the 
local subcontractor for ICP software development, and the Bureau of 
Foreign Trade to review the progress of the software development. 
 
¶C. (SBU) On September 9, the Advisor plans to meet with Ministry of 
Justice Investigation Bureau agents to review recent export control 
enforcement efforts. 
 
¶D. (SBU) On September 10, the Advisor will participate in the 
Australia Group's briefing on its recent activities to Taiwan 
officials.  Representatives from Japan and the Czech Republic are 
also expected to attend.  The meeting is hosted by the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs.
