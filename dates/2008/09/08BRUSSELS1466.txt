(U) Per reftels, USEU requested EU attendance at upcoming 
meetings on Haiti and Cuba on the margins of UNGA.  EU 
Council Secretariat DG Robert Cooper will be unable to attend 
the meeting on Haiti as requested, as he will be with SG/HR 
Solana at that time.  The European Commission will be 
represented at both meetings, probably by Development 
Director-General Stefano Manservisi.  Manservisi's staff 
assured post that the USG has already been informed of 
Commission participation, although post is unaware of any 
such communication.  Commission staffers asked that the USG 
reach out to the Commission in New York to confirm the times, 
places, and Commission participation at both meetings.
