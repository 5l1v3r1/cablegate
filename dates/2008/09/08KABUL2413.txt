RELEASE OF MUHAMMAD AHMAD, SON OF AAFIA SIDDIQUI 
 
REF: STATE 93972 
 
 ¶1. (SBU) Polcouns telephoned MFA Senior Advisor Davood 
Marodian on 9/3, and urged the GOA to inform the Embassy of 
its timeline on releasing Muhammad Ahmad and to notify the 
Embassy before any release.  Marodian attended FM Spanta,s 
9/2 press conference where Spanta announced the GOA would 
release Ashan soon to his family.  Marodian said the choice 
of the word &family8 was deliberate, to maintain some GOA 
flexibility on to whom it would release the boy. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Marodian understood our points, but urged us to 
inform the GOA quickly of Washington guidance on how to 
handle the case.  Marodian assured Polcouns that he would 
coordinate with the relevant GOA authorities to ensure no 
release occurs before we know Washington guidance.  He would 
look into what if any timeline there was on a release. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Pakistan charge delivered a diplomatic note 
earlier today asserting the child was of Pakistani 
citizenship and requesting the child,s release to his family 
in Pakistan.  The MFA will take no immediate action. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment: The MFA is willing to help us, but it does 
not have custody of the boy and must rely on cooperation of 
other GOA agencies.  We require timely Washington guidance.
