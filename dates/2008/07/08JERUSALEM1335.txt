Main Stories:

Palestinian Authority President Mahmud Abbas' July 22 meetings in 
Ramallah and Jerusalem lead coverage.  The three dailies report that 
Abbas commented during a meeting with Fatah members that, "the 
Palestinian people are having difficulty negotiating with the 
Israelis."  He added that if Israeli Defense Forces continue West 
Bank incursions and the humiliation of Palestinian security forces, 
he will withdraw Palestinian security forces from the city of Nablus 
and hold Israel responsible for the decision.  In related coverage, 
front pages report that Abbas met with Israeli President Peres in 
Jerusalem.  During a joint press conference, Abbas confirmed that, 
"a better future should greet our coming generations."  Peres stated 
that Israel and the Palestinians will continue to work on solving 
the problems between them through "difficult compromises" made by 
both sides.  Peres also focused on the need for the establishment of 
a Palestinian state living side by side with Israeli in peace and 
hope, according to coverage. 
 
Palestinian Authority Premier Salam Fayyad's July 22 press 
conference in Ramallah captures headlines.  Speaking after a meeting 
with members of the Palestinian Legislative Council, "not-including 
Hamas members", Fayyad stated that foreign aid has not yet 
materialized and the financial situation of the government is 
difficult.  Fayyad confirmed that the Palestinian government is, 
nevertheless, making every effort to pay the salaries of public 
employees.  Al- Hayat Al-Jadida quotes Fayyad stating that, 
"reunification of the homeland, under any scenario, is a top 
Palestinian priority, and that Israel has not presented any 
solution, "that Palestinians can accept."  All dailies cover news 
that Fayyad will meet with Israeli Minister of Defense, Ehud Barak, 
on July 23 to discuss a number of issues, especially Israeli 
incursions into the Palestinian Territories. 
 
Front pages highlight the "bulldozer attack" on July 22 in West 
Jerusalem.  In an apparent break from previous reporting on similar 
attacks, the dailies simply describe the perpetrator as an 
"attacker" and remain silent about a possible motive, thereby 
denying the dead assailant and his act, the customary glorification. 
 All dailies report that the "attacker" was 22-year old East 
Jerusalem resident Ghassan Abu Tayr and also note that 16 Israelis 
were injured in the attack.  The dailies run front page pictures of 
the crime scene. 
Quartet representative Tony Blair's call on the European Union to 
play a greater role in the peace process is front page news. 
Blair's call came during a July 22 meeting with EU foreign 
ministers, during which he also expressed his optimism about the 
possibility of Israelis and Palestinians reaching a peace agreement 
by the end of 2008. 
 
Al-Ayyam highlights news that Hamas leader Sa'id Siam told local and 
Arab press in the Gaza Strip on July 22 that Hamas will not deal 
with Palestinian Authority President Abbas after January 2009 in his 
capacity as president.  Siam added that Abbas has no intention of 
launching national dialogue and stressed that Hamas has already 
shown too much flexibility on the issue. 
 
The three Palestinian dailies, Wafa news agency and a number of 
local news websites ran the July 22 Haaretz story alleging that the 
U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem is increasing tension between Washington 
and Tel Aviv.  Al- Hayat Al- Jadida runs the story on its front 
page.

BLOCK QUOTES:

¶1.  Independent Al-Quds runs its daily editorial by Rasim Ebaydat 
from Jerusalem, entitled, "America has no permanent enemies, when 
will Arab moderates learn that???" (7/23): "...America sees that 
engaging Iran... is better than encountering it militarily.  This 
Iranian-American relationship should switch on a lightbulb for 
moderate Arab countries, who are... dependent on what they call 
their American ally and friend.  Many indications show that this 
ally cares chiefly about ensuring its own interests... all the 
world... obeys the strong and not the weak.  In several cases there 
has been a retreat by moderate Arab countries from their role and 
presence [in the region] which has enabled other regional countries 
to play a larger role... [moderate Arab countries] should know that 
being dependent on the American ally does not guarantee security. 
If America feels that these countries are a burden, it will find 
pretexts and justifications to not only... [exit the relationship], 
but also bring them before international courts..." 
 
¶2.  Independent Al-Ayyam carries an editorial by Hani Habib 
entitled, "Obama...prey to Israeli extortion" (7/23): "...pleasing 
Israel is what the two candidates [for U.S. presidency] seek... so, 
it is not strange to see Obama and McCain making statements about 
their foreign policy regarding Israel.  This makes the competition 
for the White House a question of seeking Israel's approval... in 
our opinion, Obama faces a difficult job in Israel.  His 
contradictory statements on the Middle East conflict have made 
Israelis more skeptical of his policies...  McCain has taken 
advantage of [Obama's contradictions] and accused [Obama] of a lack 
of political experience... in addition to all that, some Israelis at 
the Foreign Ministry are afraid that Obama is an unknown quantity... 
Obama will Qce difficulties and extortion in seeking Israel's 
approval... and the Jewish state will push [him] psychologically, 
financially and morally via the Jewish lobby in the United States, 
to clarify his policies..."
