SUBJECT: INFORMATION FOR UN AND EU SANCTIONS ON ZIMBABWE - 
GIDEON GONO 
 
REF: SECSTATE 72065 
 
The Belgian MFA confirmed to emboff that Belgium and other EU 
countries have no objection to adding Gideon Gono's name to 
the Annex of the UNSCR resolution on Zimbabwe listing names 
of individuals and entities supporting actions and policies 
which undermined democratic processes in Zimbabwe.  Belgian 
officials in New York may already have conveyed this 
information to USUN.  The Belgians stated they had only 
expressed surprise and not an objection to adding Gono's name 
to the annex. They were surprised because Gono's name was not 
already on the EU sanctions list.  They have no objection to 
any of the 14 individuals the USG proposes to list in the 
UNSCR annex. EU member state ambassadors resident in Zimbabwe 
recently sent their unanimous recommendation to add Gideon 
Gono's name to the EU Zimbabwe sanctions list whenever the EU 
next reviews the list.
