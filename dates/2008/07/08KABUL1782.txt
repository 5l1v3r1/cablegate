KABUL 00001782  001.2 OF 002 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: Security in the northern province of Jowzjan has 
improved over the past six months, at least partly due to efforts of 
the new governor, Hashem Zari.  Some districts bordering Tajikistan 
remain insecure because of smuggling and other insurgency-related 
criminal activity.  Dostum's recent clash in Kabul with the Turkmen 
leader Akbar Bay does not seem to concern most people in the 
province.  Drought has caused significant problems in both grain 
production and animal grazing.  Governor Zari is negotiating grazing 
rights with neighboring Turkmenistan.  The Provincial Council works 
well with both Governor Zari and Kabul's line ministry 
representatives.  Governor Zari has established a strong, positive 
role in the province since his appointment in November 2007.  He has 
strong relations with all provincial authorities, including the 
newly appointed chief of the National Directorate of Security. 
Security: Calm and Improving 
----------------------------- 
¶2. (SBU) Jowzjan is calm and security has improved over the last six 
months despite potential inter-ethnic conflict and rival political 
parties.  Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin (HiG) reportedly contributes to 
increased instability in the remote districts of Qushtepa and 
Darzab.  Local support for extremists and ongoing criminal activity 
in those districts may cause deterioration in security, linked to 
the neighboring districts of Belcheragh and Sayyd, in Faryab and 
Sar-e-Pul provinces, respectively. 
¶3. (SBU) The northern border district of Qarqin remains vulnerable 
due to smuggling of drugs and weapons, and potential insurgent or 
anti-GIROA activity driven by Turkmen minority movements.  Most 
insurgent activity is limited to recruitment, propaganda and 
smuggling. 
¶4. (SBU) Dostum's recent clash in Kabul with Turkmen leader Akbar 
Bay and the Afghan government's reaction to the incident did not 
have a strong impact in Jowzjan.  Local political leaders, including 
Junbesh party leaders, downplayed the incident.  While many in 
Jowzjan province, especially ethnic Uzbeks, consider Dostum the 
"founding father" of Junbesh and the Uzbek "national hero" of 
liberation, most say Dostum's clash with Bay and Karzai is not 
relevant to daily life in Jowzjan. 
Development: Drought Has Affected Agriculture 
--------------------------------------------- 
¶5. (SBU) Jowzjan's primarily agricultural and rain-fed economy has 
been significantly impacted by drought.  Governor Zari is discussing 
potential temporary grazing rights with Turkmenistan.  Reportedly, 
meat prices dropped during the spring because of oversupply 
resulting from farmers slaughtering cattle due to lack of animal 
feed. 
¶6. (SBU) Shebergan city is the only major urban area in the 
province.  Industry is limited, although U.S. assistance is targeted 
at reviving oil production and processing around Shebergan. 
Underemployment continues to drive farmers to urban centers and 
young men to Pakistan or Iran, usually leaving their families 
behind.  Turkmen communities weave carpets, which is often the major 
source of income in these rural areas. 
¶7. (SBU) According to Provincial Council (PC) members and some 
political leaders, work on getting the central government's approval 
and funding of the Provincial Development Plan is progressing well, 
partly thanks to Governor Zari's efforts to connect the PC members 
with ministries and parliamentarians in Kabul.  The Governor 
organized several trips to Kabul for PC members and other provincial 
elders to meet with President Karzai and ministry representatives. 
 
Governance: New Governor Starts Well 
------------------------------------ 
¶8. (SBU) Hashem Zari became governor in November 2007 after a 
six-month vacancy following the abrupt departure of Juma Khan 
Hamdard in May 2007.  Zari gets along well with the PC, most line 
ministry directors, and most political players in the province, 
although there appears to be tension between him and Deputy Governor 
Faquir.  Zari always emphasizes his political independence and walks 
a fine line between old Dostum supporters and other players in the 
province.  There are some indications that he may favor Junbesh, as 
he seems to have bureaucratically hindered the establishment of a 
Jamiat political office in Shebergan.  The power struggle between 
Dostum and his rivals in the region seems to be slowly fading, 
although any movement to limit Dostum's position could quickly 
instigate new problems, especially if Dostum decides to mobilize the 
network of sub-commanders he still controls. 
¶9. (SBU) Jowzjan's PC functions independently and cooperates well 
with Governor Zari and the line ministries.  All of the PC members 
are active in discussions and are well informed about the line 
ministries' work and the Provincial Development Plan's priorities. 
¶10. (SBU) The Provincial Chief of Police faces difficult challenges

insurgents or criminals.  Relations between the police and the 
National Directorate for Security (NDS) have improved since the 
appointment of a new NDS director, a Jamiat supporter.
