REF: A. STATE 69691 
     ¶B. SAN JOSE 186 
 
¶1. We delivered Ref A demarche on July 2 to Deyanira Ramirez, 
MFA UN Desk Officer.  She was pleased that Kosovo remained a 
top U.S. priority and that the U.S. was seeking wider 
recognition of Kosovo's independence, given that Costa Rica 
was one of the first nations to grant recognition (Ref B). 
However, Ramirez expressed that Costa Rica would not be among 
the donor countries.
