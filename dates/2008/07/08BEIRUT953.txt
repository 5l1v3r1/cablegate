Classified By: Charge d'Affaires a.i. Michele J. Sison for reasons 1.4( 
a) and (b) 
 
¶1. (C) Summary. Charge and Office of Defense Cooperation 
Chief visited three Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) sites on 30 
June, including the Lebanese Mine Action Center (LMAC), the 
LAF Engineer Regiment, and the Mine Detecting Dog unit. The 
purpose of these visits was to publicly demonstrate the scope 
of U.S. support to humanitarian demining in Lebanon -- 
approximately $10 million since 2006 -- and to inspect the 
equipment purchased through the Department of State's PM 
Bureau Weapons Removal and Abatement Program, currently 
executed by Dyncorp Corporation. End Summary 
 
¶2. (C) At the Lebanese Mine Action Center (LMAC), the Charge 
met with Brigadier General Mohamed Fehmi. To date, U.S. 
funding has assisted in clearing 4,092,569 square meters of 
land returned to productive and safe use, with an additional 
789,803 square meters of land scheduled for clearance. The 
Government of Lebanon GOL) contributes $5.5 million per year 
to the LMAC budget. BG Fehmi discussed the need for increased 
future funding for victim assistance related to landmines and 
unexploded munitions. The LMAC plans to expand the scope of 
its responsibilities by opening an LMAC office, funded with 
the assistance of State/PM and Dyncorp in Nabatiyeh in 
southern Lebanon. This office will be fully mission capable 
by January 2009 and is one component of a broader GOL plan to 
assume full responsibility from the United Nations for the 
humanitarian demining mission in Lebanon by then. Fehmi also 
discussed the importance of accurate and complete "strike 
data" from the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) in regard to the 
2006 Israeli-Hizballah conflict. 
 
¶3. (C) The Charge next visited the LAF Engineer Regiment and 
met with its Commander, Colonel Roland Abou Jaoudi. The 
Colonel briefed the capabilities and mission of his unit via 
a five minute film and then guided the Charge through a 
static display of his unit's diverse array of humanitarian 
demining equipment to include about one dozen new trucks -- 
such as Ford Superduty F250s, Toyota Landcruiser Ambulances, 
cargo vans, Ford Explorers, and Ford F150s -- out of a total 
of 62 trucks of various types that the USG has provided to 
the LMAC and Engineer Regiment. Abou Jaoudi also discussed 
the upcoming resumption in August 2008 of the U.S. NAVCENT 
maritime demining engagement that is surveying the multiple 
munitions sites in Lebanese territorial waters, the scope of 
which has yet to be determined. Abou Jaoudi also  discussed 
the importance of the LAF acquiring armored bulldozers for 
future military operation in urban terrain. The Charge' 
observed one LAF bulldozer with "field expedient" armor with 
Nahr al Barid battle damage, which included holes in the 
armor plating from projectiles. (NOTE: Embassy has requested, 
through USCENTCOM, four D9 Armored bulldozers via FY-08 
"Tranche Four" 1206 funding. END NOTE.) 
 
¶4. (C) At the last site of the visit, the Hammana Base in the 
mountains above Aley, the Charge observed a training 
demonstration of the LAF's mine detecting dogs in a live 
minefield.  She also inspected their training facilities and 
kennel, which has recently been refurbished by U.S. funds 
executed and supervised by Dyncorp. The dogs are acquired and 
initially trained by NGO donations, notably the Marshall 
Legacy Institute, and further trained and maintained by LAF 
soldiers. This LAF program began in 2001 and periodically 
receives new dogs to replace those dogs who are retired due 
to age. 
 
COMMENT 
------ 

¶5. (C) U.S.-supported demining in Lebanon has been very 
successful.  The Lebanese Armed Forces have been cooperative, 
technically proficient and grateful for U.S. support. 
Continued USG demining efforts help improve the image of the 
U.S. in southern Lebanon, the area hardest hit during the 
2006 Lebanese-Israeli conflict.  Charge's June 30 visit to 
review U.S.-funded demining programs received widespread, 
positive media coverage on July 1.  End Comment.
