Classified By: CDA Christopher Henzel for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). (S) A/DCM delivered reftel points to MFA Legal Affairs Director Dr. Yusuf Abdulkarim on July 22. Dr. Yusuf is the GOB's principal POC on IAEA matters. He immediately grasped the problems Syria's candidacy posed, noting that it would be "troubling" to have Syria sitting on the Board of Governors while its own activities are under investigation. Dr. Yusuf said that he supported the idea of an alternative candidate, but must consult with the Foreign Minister's office before instructing Bahrain's Geneva mission (which also covers the IAEA in Vienna) to reach out to the Kazakhs. ********************************************* ******** Visit Embassy Manama's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX********************************************* ******** HENZEL
