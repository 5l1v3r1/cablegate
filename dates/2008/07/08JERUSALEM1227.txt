The visit of Palestinian Authority Premier Fayyad to the West Bank 
communities of Nablus city and Ni'lin village on July 10 attracts 
front page coverage in the three dailies.  During his visit to 
Nablus, Fayyad emphasized that all Israeli actions against 
Palestinian institutions in Nablus are illegal and violate previous 
agreements and commitments and are therefore, "invalid."  Fayyad 
also condemned the "escalation" of Israeli settlement activities and 
the construction of the separation barrier, while praising the 
steadfastness of villages affected negatively by the barrier.  In 
related coverage, Al-Ayyam reports that 17 demonstrators were 
injured when Israeli soldiers dispersed a peaceful march protesting 
the separation barrier in Ni'lin village on July 10.  Al-Quds leads 
with a photo of armed Israeli soldiers disbursing the foreign and 
Palestinian protestors. 
 
Front pages highlight that the, "Palestinian leadership is studying 
the possibility of halting communication with Israel until 
settlement activities stop."  The comment was made by Yasir 
Abd-Rabbuh, Secretary of the Executive Committee of the PLO at a 
press conference on July 10.  Abd-Rabbuh added that a decision to 
halt communications would be implemented upon the return of 
Palestinian Authority President Abbas from Paris. 
 
Front page headlines announce the first killing of a Palestinian by 
Israeli soldiers since the start of the Israel/Hamas truce in the 
Gaza Strip.  The incident took place next to Kisofim crossing in the 
northern Strip on July 10.  In response, Al-Aqsa Brigades fired 
rockets at Sderot "settlement" (city) in southern Israel.  In 
contrast, Hamas arrested three Hamas activists who fired rockets at 
Sderot on July 10, the papers report. 
 
In an exclusive interview with Al- Quds on July 10, Hamas leader 
Musa Abu Marzuq announced that Cairo will soon host closed-door 
negotiations between Israel and Hamas regarding a prisoners exchange 
deal that could include the release of Israeli soldier Shalit. 
 
On an inside page, Al-Quds reports that three Palestinian Fulbright 
students, "who wish to benefit from a scholarship to the United 
States, despite Israeli actions that are preventing them from 
traveling," met on July 10 with U.S. Consulate officials at the Erez 
crossing point for visa interviews.  The article is accompanied by a 
photo showing the three students waiting to cross the checkpoint to 
meet with U.S. officials on the Israeli side of the crossing.

BLOCK QUOTES:

¶1.  Independent Al-Quds runs its daily editorial entitled: "Dr. 
Fayyad's ideas to end division are practical and constructive" 
(7/11): "...out of a feeling of deep responsibility towards his 
people and the cause of his homeland, [Palestinian Authority 
Premier] Dr. Fayyad has laid out some constructive and practical 
ideas to end division between the West Bank and Gaza Strip.  These 
ideas have two main elements:  First, the formation of a national, 
non-factional caretaker government to run the country's affairs and 
prepare for legitimate, presidential elections.  Second, Arab 
assistance in re-establishing Palestinian security capacities that 
are professional and would provide [interim] security for the Gaza 
Strip... Fayyad's ideas are practical, constructive, and realistic 
 
JERUSALEM 00001227  002 OF 002 
 
 
which is why all Palestinian factions should happily accept and 
support them.  Especially, since these ideas meet the needs of the 
Palestinian people, provide security, and pave the way for 
legitimate, presidential elections..." 
 
¶2.  Independent Al-Ayyam runs an editorial by former Palestinian 
National Council member, Azmi Al-Khawaja, entitled: "Settlement 
activities and the 'racist separation wall' are killing the peace 
process" (7/11): "... [Israeli] settlement activities continue as 
does the construction of the barrier that is swallowing up land. 
All this is happening in the absence of decision makers - mere 
condemnations are useless.  If we compare the situation in 1996 to 
the current one, we find that there is a big difference in the [rate 
of] settlement expansion and the construction of the barrier.  What 
[Palestinians] want is: a)  reunification of the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip...b) a national unity government with an active Palestinian 
Legislative Council... c) an active PLO... d) a halt to negotiations 
with [Israeli leaders] Olmert and Livni because they are useless and 
because there can be no Palestinian state or guarantee of rights 
without the return of refugees, without Jerusalem, and without a 
complete Israeli withdrawal to the borders of 1967..."
