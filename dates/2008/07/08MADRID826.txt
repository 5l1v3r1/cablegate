Â¶1.  Ambassador spoke to FM Moratinos the morning of July 23 
and conveyed our deep concerns about Venezuela.  He asked 
Moratinos to remind the GOV of its commitments under the 
Inter-American Charter, with particular emphasis on the civil 
and political rights of Venezuelans.   Moratinos told 
Ambassador that Spain shared our concerns and that the 
talking points addressing those issues were already prepared 
for the GOS principals that would engage with Chavez during 
his July 24-25 visit.
