REF: STATE 76596 
 
On July 17, Poloff delivered reftel points to Kamran Akhtar, 
Director of Disarmament for the MFA, and requested that 
Pakistan freeze the assets of the additional Iranian entities 
and individuals included under E.O. 13382. Akhtar assured 
Poloff that Pakistan diligently followed the rules as 
outlined in UNSCRs 1737, 1747, and 1803, and if these new 
entities were now listed under these guidelines, they would 
also freeze the assets for those additions as well. However, 
Akhtar noted that Pakistan would not freeze the assets of the 
newly listed entities without notification from the Pakistan 
UN delegation but would do so once informed officially by 
this body. Akhtar provided Poloff with a copy of the April 
2008 Statutory Notification 339(I)/2008, which outlined which 
Iranian individuals and entities Pakistan currently froze - 
including only three of the newly listed under E.O. 13382.
