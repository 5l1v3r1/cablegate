Â¶1. (SBU) Post approached the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture 
regarding the U.S. raw sugar tariff rate quota (TRQ) and received 
the following response.  Brazil has already shipped nearly all of 
its FY2008 quota to the U.S. and expects to ship the entire amount. 
If the U.S. were to open further TRQ quantities, Brazil would be in 
a position to supply this demand.
