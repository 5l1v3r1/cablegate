SUBJECT: NO EVIDENCE OF SEA/GTIP MISCONDUCT IN UNDOF/UNTSO 
MISSION 
 
REF: STATE 68780 
 
¶1. (U) This cable is in response to State 68780. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Post contacted sources in the local human rights and 
NGO communities, in addition to media and DAT contacts 
regarding the status of SEA/GTIP in the UNDOF/UNTSO mission. 
Sources had no knowledge of any SEA/GTIP related complaints 
against UNDOF/UNTSO personnel operating in the Golan. 
According to DAT, who has traveled extensively through 
UNDOF/UNTSO theater, local perceptions of UNDOF/UNTSO are 
positive, and we are unaware of any reports of sexual abuse 
or trafficking by UN personnel.  (Comment: Embassy's frequent 
contact with UNDOF/UNTSO strongly suggests both organizations 
excercise effective leadership that expects and enforces high 
professional standards for all of its staff. End Comment.) 
 
¶3. (SBU) Syria was designated as a tier 3 country in the June 
2008 Trafficking in Persons Report due to Syria's standing as 
both a transit and a destination country for women and 
children trafficked for commercial exploitation and forced 
labor.  However, Post has no information that the broader 
problem of SEA/GTIP in Syria is being exacerbated by the UN 
Peacekeeping mission.
