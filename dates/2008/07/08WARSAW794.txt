Post delivered reftel demarche on June 24, 2008 to Maciej 
Switkowski, director of the Department of Post in Poland's 
Ministry of Infrastructure.  Switkowski stated Poland would 
review the U.S. candidates, and noted Poland has no 
candidates of its own.  He stated he understood U.S. concerns 
regarding Russia's proposed revision of the Universal Postal 
Union (UPU) Mission Statement, and suggested Poland may share 
the U.S. view.  He also mentioned a Japanese proposal. 
Poland's general preference is to limit growth in its 
contributions to the budgets of international organizations, 
so Switkowski seemed open to the U.S preference for zero 
nominal growth in the UPU budget.  Switkowski concluded by 
noting that final Polish positions will be developed in 
consultation with the Foreign Ministry.  On June 27, post 
delivered reftel demarche to Tomasz Ostaszewicz and Zofia 
Schnitzer, in the Department of International Bilateral 
Cooperation at the Ministry of Economy, who reiterated 
Poland's interest in containing the budget of international 
organizations.  The demarche and diplomatic note were also 
delivered to the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
