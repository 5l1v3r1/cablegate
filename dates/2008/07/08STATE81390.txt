FOR PSI 5TH ANNIVERSARY PRESENTATION 
 
REF: STATE 023568 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY AND BACKGROUND:  Ambassador Friedrich Groning, 
Commissioner of the Federal Government for Arms Control and 
Disarmament, German Foreign Office, gave a presentation at 
the Senior-Level Meeting for all states endorsing the 
Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI), held May 28, 2008, 
in Washington, DC, on the occasion of the PSI's Fifth 
Anniversary.  Groning's presentation described a PSI resource 
website newly proposed and developed by Germany.  The PSI 
Senior-Level Meeting was attended by representatives of 85 
countries, almost all of the 92 states that have endorsed the 
PSI. 
 
¶2.  ACTION REQUESTED:  Embassy is requested to deliver under 
appropriate cover the following letter from Acting Under 
Secretary John Rood to Ambassador Groning, thanking him for 
his presentation at the PSI Fifth Anniversary Senior-Level 
Meeting.  The State Department does not plan to release the 
text of this letter but has no objection if the Government of 
Germany wishes to do so.  There will be no signed original. 
 
¶3.  Begin text of letter: 
 
Dear Ambassador Groning: 
 
On behalf of the U.S. Government, I want to thank you for 
your presentation "Expanding Distribution of PSI Information: 
 The PSI Resource Page" given at the May 28, 2008 
Senior-Level Meeting for Proliferation Security Initiative 
(PSI) participants in Washington DC.  Your presentation made 
an important contribution to the meeting.  We are looking 
forward to widespread use of Germany's new PSI website as a 
tool for participating countries to stay better informed on 
PSI developments. 
 
I believe the PSI Fifth Anniversary Senior-Level Meeting was 
very successful in reaffirming the strong commitment of the 
PSI partner states to respond to the WMD proliferation 
challenge.  It also provided the participants from 85 
countries an opportunity to strengthen communication with one 
another.  We hope this event will result in expanded 
participation in PSI activities, particularly on a regional 
basis.  The United States recognizes that Germany plays a 
significant role in the PSI, and we greatly appreciate your 
Government's continued efforts and contributions to advancing 
the PSI goals. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
John C. Rood 
Acting Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and 
International Security
