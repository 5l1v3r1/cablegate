Al Quds and Al Ayyam lead with their daily reports on Israeli 
operations in the West Bank and Jerusalem.  According to all papers, 
26 Palestinians, including former Hamas parliamentarian Muna 
Mansour, were arrested as part of a July 21 incursion into the West 
Bank city of Nablus.  Israeli forces, "invaded dozens of houses, 
checked them and destroyed their contents," and confiscated 
computers, according to coverage.  Al- Quds leads with a photo of 
Hamas member Mansour's sons surveying the damage by Israeli forces 
to their house.  Jericho and a village near Hebron were also sites 
of Israeli activity where local institutions were "invaded," two 
arrests made and one Palestinian youth injured.  In Jerusalem news, 
Al-Quds continues coverage of the week-long "sit-in" at the house of 
the Al-Kurd family in Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood in East Jerusalem, 
following eviction orders by the Israeli Supreme Court.  The owner 
of the house is quoted as saying, "I wouldn't give up my house for 
all the money in the world." 
 
All dailies highlight official Palestinian reaction to, "Israeli 
escalation [of operations] in the West Bank and Jerusalem." 
Palestinian Authority Minister of Information Al-Malki especially 
condemned ongoing activities in Nablus city and he confirmed in a 
press conference on July 21 that the Palestinian Authority (PA) 
Government is following the issue closely and considers the 
"escalation" to be illegal.  Al-Malki also reiterated PA support for 
the residents of Jerusalem. 
 
Citing Israeli sources, Al-Ayyam leads with a reported "demand" by 
the U.S. administration to Israeli and Palestinian negotiators that 
they produce a "written document outlining their achievements" in 
negotiations, to be presented to the new U.S. president in January 
¶2009. 
 
Al- Ayyam covers news about captured Israeli soldier Shalit. 
Israeli sources expect that negotiations between Hamas and Israel 
will resume in the coming few weeks through Egyptian mediation.  The 
sources also revealed that Jimmy Carter has made a proposal to 
broker a meeting between Hamas, Israel and Egypt to push the 
prisoner exchange negotiations forward, the paper noted.  In related 
coverage on Al- Ayyam's front page, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyyah 
confirmed on July 21 that Hamas will not give in on its demands 
regarding a prisoner release deal with Israel. 
 
Al- Ayyam's front pages highlight Secretary Rice's July 21 meeting 
with representatives of nine countries in Abu Dhabi.  The paper 
notes that the meeting took place an hour after Rice "threatened 
Iran with punishment" over its nuclear program if Iran does not 
"cooperate" in the next two weeks. 
 
Coverage also highlights news about the British Premier Gordon 
Brown's speech at the Israeli Knesset on July 21 in which he called 
on Palestinians to fight terrorists and threatened Iran with new 
sanctions.  Al- Ayyam quotes Brown stating that, "achieving peace 
includes a withdrawal from settlements and a fair solution to the 
Palestinian refugee cause."  Al- Quds quotes Brown asserting that, 
"peace between Palestinians and Israelis is possible and Jerusalem 
is the capital of the two cities."  In related coverage, Al- Quds 
reports a spokesperson of the British Consulate General in Jerusalem 
reiterated to local press on July 21 the message that East Jerusalem 
is the capital of the future Palestinian state.

¶1.  Al- Quds prints its daily editorial entitled, "Brown's Visit and 
his Positive Declarations" (7/22): "During his visit to the 
Palestinian lands and Israel, British Premier Gordon Brown showed 
positive understanding of the situation and peace demands. He talked 
frankly and clearly regarding the need to stop the settlement 
activities in Jerusalem and other places in the West Bank, to 
facilitate passage into and out of the city, and to open all the 
closed institutions, such as the Arab Chamber of Commerce. In 
addition, he referred to the ongoing attempt to find a solution to 
the 1967 borders ...and announced as well the donation of $60 
million to the Palestinian National Authority, of which $30 million 
will be dedicated to the building of housing units and to the 
creation of 50,000 job opportunities... However, Brown is not the 
first Western leader who has visited the country and will not be the 
last, and we always listen to declarations that have vaporized in 
the air..." 
 
¶2.  Al-Ayyam runs an editorial by Muhammad Abdel-Hamid entitled, 
"Why Don't We Withdraw from the Negotiations?" (7/22): "...What 
shall we lose if we state that we will continue the negotiations 
only if Israel shows commitment and fulfills its obligations 
according to the Road Map?  We do not lose anything. On the 
contrary, the condition of negotiating what has been set by the 
Quartet and at the Annapolis conference places the [Western] 
countries between two options: either being biased to the Israeli 
attitude or respecting international legislation ... The withdrawal 
from the negotiations is a legal and important attitude to show the 
Arab and the world the reality of what is going on. And to stress 
the necessity of intervention and international supervision of 
international legislation. Withdrawal from the negotiations would 
mark an important strategy for the Palestinian people that would 
rebuild national unity, PA institutions, and their international 
allies."
