¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post's assistance in conducting 
a post-shipment check on application 050086962 for the export 
of C-130 spare parts to Morocco.  Some items shipped from the 
U.S. to Morocco via Greece on March 28 and April 5, 2008, but 
over $5.5 million remains to be exported.  Post is requested 
to complete this Blue Lantern check within 45 days.  Lack of 
response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and 
future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request:  Unusual routing to the Royal Air 
Force of Morocco (RAFM) via Greece. 
 
¶4. ACTION: Embassy is requested to make inquiries with 
appropriate RAFM officials to determine if it has received 
the C-130 spare parts from Hellenic Aerospace Industry in 
Greece and that the articles are being used for the purpose 
stated on the license.  What is the nature of the RAFM's 
relationship with Hellenic Aerospace? Are there any 
additional foreign parties, including consignees in Morocco, 
involved in this transaction?  Does the RAFM understand the 
restrictions on United States Munitions List (USML) articles, 
particularly regarding re-export and retransfer?  Post may 
find it useful to reference Hellenic Aerospace Industries 
Letter of Intent dated December 5, 2007 and signed by P. 
Bourtzinakos, Director.  END ACTION.
