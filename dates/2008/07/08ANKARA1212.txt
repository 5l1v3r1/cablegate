Classified By: Pol-Mil Counselor Carl Siebentritt for 
reasons 1.4 (b,d). 
 
¶1. (U) The Turkish General Staff's (TGS) official reaction to 
the July 1 "Ergenekon" arrests (ref a), which netted two 
retired army four-star generals and other former military 
personnel, has been limited to an official website posting 
clarifying that searches of military property related to the 
arrests were conducted according to law by military 
personnel, not civilian police, with the participation of a 
public prosecutor.  Land Forces Commander and CHOD-apparent 
Gen Ilker Basbug told journalists July 2 that "we are living 
through difficult days in Turkey.  We must all act with 
commonsense, care and responsibility."  He denied press 
reports that he had discussed the arrests with Prime Minister 
Erdogan during their June 24 meeting, chiding the press for 
publishing "conspiracy theories" aimed at undermining the 
unity and integrity of the armed forces.  The Prime Ministry 
issued a similar denial, describing as "deliberate 
fabrications" allegations that Erdogan and Basbug discussed 
the arrests. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The arrests come a month ahead of the August meeting 
of the Supreme Military Council (YAS), which will decide on 
the promotion and assignment of the most senior TGS leaders, 
as well as on expulsions of military officers for excessive 
piety, corruption, or other "unbecoming" activities.  As 
chairman of the YAS, the prime minister is expected to agree 
to recommendations, formulated in advance by the military, 
which are then subject to the president's approval.  Basbug 
is expected to be anointed CHOD during the YAS, while there 
are several candidates for the Deputy CHOD position.  Other 
assignments to major commands made at the YAS will indicate 
who future top commanders will be. 
 
¶3. (C) Political upheaval, including a possible closure 
decision against the ruling Justice and Development Party 
(AKP), could complicate this military succession process.  It 
is likely the military's low key response to the arrests is 
an indication it wants to avoid jeopardizing a smooth 
transition and may prefer that an AKP closure decision occur 
after the YAS.  It is also not in the interest of the Erdogan 
government to further complicate its own precarious situation 
by opposing the military's choices for top positions, a move 
that would exacerbate already high tensions.  There is some 
speculation that Erdogan's June 24 meeting with Basbug, 
reportedly to discuss security matters, was a signal the 
government will not oppose Basbug's promotion to CHOD.  In 
2006, the YAS announced Gen Yasar Buyukanit's selection as 
CHOD on the first day of meeting, widely seen as reflecting 
Erdogan's desire to ensure a non-contentious military 
leadership succession (ref c).' 
 
¶4. (C) All are awaiting the closure case decision and its 
timing, and publication of the evidence against the Ergenekon 
suspects, as indicators of the degree of political tension 
Turkey will experience in the coming weeks.
