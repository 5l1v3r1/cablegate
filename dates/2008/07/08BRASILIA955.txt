GUILDELINES 
 
¶1.  The US Embassy Brasilia will be embarking on a Phase 2 
Renovation of the Embassy Chancery starting in FY2009 or FY2010. 
Recognizing the growing importance of environmental issues in Brazil 
and South America, the Executive Office of the Embassy Brasilia 
requests that the Office of Buildings Operations (OBO) of the 
Department of State give the highest priority to environmental 
sustainability in the design and construction of the facility 
renovation.  Per our understanding of OBO's Energy and Sustainable 
Design Program, a wide range of environmentally-appropriate 
technologies and strategies can be incorporated into facility 
renovations, resulting in improved operational efficiency and 
reduced ecological impact. 
 
¶2.  It is hoped that OBO's Phase 2 Renovation design and 
construction plan, will give thorough attention to optimize energy 
efficiency and environmental soundness of the following systems: 
Exterior security lighting systems, internal lighting systems and 
controls, internal air circulation systems and HVAC controls (for 
cooling only), internal potable water systems (use of innovative 
bathroom fixtures), potential use of solar water heat (as 
appropriate), efficient bathroom hand dryer systems (evaluation of 
long-term cost of hand driers or paper towels), use of appropriate 
roof insulation, efficient collection systems for waste and 
recyclables, and other systems. 
 
¶3.  Local sourcing of building materials (as appropriate) would be 
desirable to reduce the ecological impact of the renovation, and 
potentially enable Mission Brazil to showcase the newly renovated 
facility as a state-of-the-art commitment to high energy efficiency 
and environmental sustainability.
