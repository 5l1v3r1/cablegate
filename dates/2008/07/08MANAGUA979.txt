¶1. (SBU) Post delivered reftel invitation to President Ortega 
via diplomatic note on July 29 seeking his participation in a 
trade summit to be held during the September 22 - 26 
timeframe, to coincide with the United Nations General 
Assembly.  Emboffs also contacted officials at the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and 
Development to make them aware of the invitation and enlist 
their support in encouraging Ortega's participation in the 
summit. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: Post will continue to follow up with the 
Nicaraguan Government and relay any substantive response. 
However, President Ortega's travel is often confirmed only at 
the last minute, and coordination with the his staff is 
exceedingly difficult.  Given Ortega's generally 
uncomplimentary view of the United States - Central America - 
Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement, we would be somewhat 
surprised if he chose to participate in the trade summit. 
End comment.
