¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: On July 15, Poloffs discussed reftel points 
with Bob Aal, Dutch MFA Security Policy Department contact 
for Africa.  At the request of the UN, the Dutch protected 
humanitarian aid convoys to Somalia this spring, but for the 
moment the Dutch are following the EU lead on responding to 
piracy and UNSCR 1816.  The Dutch have prepared new 
procedures to respond to requests from threatened 
Dutch-flagged vessels.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2.  (SBU) DUTCH SUPPORT MULTILATERAL RESPONSE TO PIRACY:  Aal 
noted that the protection of humanitarian aid from piracy has 
strong support in the Dutch parliament, and that the previous 
three-month escort mission by the Dutch frigate HMS Eversen 
this spring was very successful, delivering 43 tons of food 
aid.  The Dutch had found it easy to respond given the 
request of the United Nations, World Food Programme, and 
International Maritime Organization for escort support.  With 
regard to implementation of UNSCR 1816, however, the 
Netherlands, internal deliberations are just beginning.  Our 
"direction is unclear."  The Dutch are looking for EU 
leadership on this issue.  EU High Representative Javier 
Solana presented a paper last week that outlined options for 
responding to piracy, ranging from ESDP formal arrangements 
to informal coalitions of the willing.  The EU discussions on 
the rule of law and treatment of detained pirates "are just 
starting."   The response on detainees, jurisdiction issues, 
and asylum seekers would likely be left to individual EU 
states.  Overall, the Dutch have signaled their willingness 
to the EU to work on this issue. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) RESPONDING TO HIJACKING OF DUTCH-FLAGGED VESSELS: 
On July 11, the Dutch cabinet adopted a contingency plan for 
responding to piracy against Dutch-flagged vessels.  The 
cabinet approved a proposal by Transportation Minister 
Huizinga to designate a single office in her ministry to 
respond to Dutch shipping companies requesting aid.  Huizinga 
will lead an inter-agency effort to elaborate on the 
contingency.  The cabinet,s decision responds to the May 26 
hijacking of the MV Amiya Scan, a Dutch owned ship, off the 
coast of Somalia.  The Amiya Scan was eventually released on 
June 25 after the owners had paid a ransom to the pirates.
