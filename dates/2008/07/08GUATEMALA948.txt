RESPONSE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 79505 
 
(SBU) Embassy delivered reftel demarche to Vice Foreign 
Minister Lars Pira July 24.  Pira said that the Government of 
Guatemala supports the USG and P5 1 positions on Iran.  If 
the GOG attends the NAM Foreign Ministers' meeting in Tehran, 
its representative would proceed as suggested in reftel. 
However, no decision to attend had yet been made because of 
the substantial travel costs involved and because the NAM is 
a low diplomatic priority for Guatemala.
