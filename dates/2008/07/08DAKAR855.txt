SUBJECT: SENEGAL: WADE TO VISIT US WITH MASSIVE ENTOURAGE 
 
Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade is planning to leave for the 
United States on July 23 with a massive entourage in tow.  On July 
25, Wade will address how his country confronts climate change at 
the UNITY: Journalists of Color Convention in Chicago, Illinois. 
Wade will discuss Senegal's geographic position and the impact of 
climate changes on the African continent.  President Wade, who has 
been criticized domestically for what many consider to be excessive 
foreign travel and its high cost, will be accompanied by 35 
government officials and more than 40 "artists."  Wade is expected 
to arrive in Washington, DC on July 26.  His official program in 
Washington is TBD.
