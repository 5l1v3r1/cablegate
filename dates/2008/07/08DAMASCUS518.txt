Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) The 2008 harvest of Syria's primary strategic crop 
-- wheat -- declined by 50 percent from 2007, primarily due 
to bad weather.  For the first time in 15 years the SARG has 
turned to the international wheat market to compensate for 
the shortfall in supply.  Even with this year's record-low 
yield, experts estimate that the SARG's strategic wheat 
reserve will maintain roughly one year's supply until the 
2009 crop is harvested.  Perhaps reflective of the low yield 
and its strained regional relationships, the SARG has not yet 
taken any steps towards meeting its wheat export obligations 
to Egypt, Jordan and Yemen.  Post has received inquiries from 
several private Syrian wheat importers regarding U.S. wheat, 
although high freight costs (USD 100/MT) are a concern.  If 
the dollar continues to fall, however, U.S. wheat may enter 
the Syrian market for the first time. End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Wheat Harvest Down 50 percent from 2007 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) With 100 percent of the crop harvested, Syria's 
wheat production barely reached two million metric tons (MT) 
in 2008 -- a 50 percent decrease from last year's yield and 
the worst harvest in over ten years.  Contributing factors to 
the decline included an on-going three-year drought, a 
late-winter frost and a 357 percent increase in the price of 
diesel when the SARG cut fuel subsidies in half in early May. 
 Mostly due to the frost, much of the rain-fed wheat in the 
northeastern province of al-Hasakeh was deemed unfit for 
harvesting and was instead sold for grazing.  Landlords 
earned 5000 to 6000 SYP (USD 110-130) per dunum grazed 
without incurring harvesting and transportation expenses, 
which increased fourfold in reaction to the diesel price 
increase. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Strict SARG Actions Limited Leakage 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Anticipating a record low harvest, the SARG took a 
number of unprecedented measures in May to prevent farmers 
from both grazing their crops and smuggling harvested crops 
to the black market.  Such measures included prohibiting 
farmers from transporting harvested crops across provincial 
borders, prohibiting the harvesting and transportation of 
wheat at night, requiring cargo trucks to have police escorts 
en route to government markets, and placing military 
checkpoints on major routes to prevent the undocumented 
transportation of wheat.  These actions were somewhat 
successful in preventing leakage as the SARG's General 
Establishment for Cereal Processing and Trade (HOBOOB) 
reported purchasing 951,000 MT, or approximately 48 percent 
of the total crop.  In previous years, HOBOOB purchased an 
average of 68 percent of the total wheat crop.  The SARG also 
attempted to reassure farmers that it would help offset 
increased production costs by offering a 3000 SYP (USD 65) / 
dunum stipend for irrigation and creating a "Price Support 
Fund."  Currently, no details on the implementation of either 
of these initiatives have been issued and most Syrian farmers 
remain skeptical. 
 
 
--------------------------- 
Bashar Looking for Handouts 
--------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) During his June 2 trip to Abu Dhabi, the UAE 
President offered Bashar al-Asad a "gift" of 500,000 MT of 
wheat for the Syrian people.  We understand that Bashar asked 
for the donation after learning that the UAE was paying for 
food assistance for both Egypt and Jordan. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Wheat Trade Increasing in Political Significance 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Due to this year's record low yield, for the first 
time in 15 years the SARG has turned to the international 
wheat market to compensate for the shortfall in supply. 
HOBOOB issued a tender to purchase 120,000 MT for delivery to 
the Syrian ports of Lattakia or Tartous on a 
cost-insurance-freight (CIF) basis within a month of opening 
a letter of credit.  Local analysts theorize that such a 
tender may be the first 25 percent tranche of a 500,000 MT 
"gift" that Bashar received from the President of the UAE.  A 
competing theory holds that the SARG may have issued the 
tender as a trial balloon to test the value of its own wheat 
for export to the global market.  As Syria also produces the 
more expensive durum (hard) wheat, but primarily consumes the 
cheaper milling (soft) wheat, some experts believe that the 
SARG may try to increase its stockpiles of milling wheat by 
exporting Syrian durum. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Syria mills around 7000 MT of wheat per day, 
primarily to produce bread -- although pasta, couscous and 
bulgur are also locally manufactured.  Most of the daily 
milling requirements are provided from Syria's strategic 
wheat reserve.  The SARG is believed to have established a 
"redline" for its strategic reserves at a one-year supply, or 
roughly three million MT.  Even with this year's record-low 
yield, experts estimate that the strategic reserve will hold 
at approximately three million MT until the 2009 crop is 
harvested. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Syria has contractual obligations to export a total 
of 700,000 MT of wheat to Egypt, Jordan and Yemen.  Perhaps 
reflective of this year's low yield -- as well as of its 
strained political relationship with Egypt -- the SARG has 
yet to take any steps towards meeting these obligations. 
Post has received inquiries from several private Syrian wheat 
importers regarding U.S. wheat, although high freight costs 
(USD 100/MT) are a concern.  If the dollar continues to fall, 
however, U.S. wheat may enter the Syrian market for the first 
time. (ref D)

Comment 
------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) Global food inflation (ref A) and recent SARG 
economic policy decisions (ref B) have combined to 
substantially increase the economic pressure on the average 
Syrian consumer.  While Syrians openly grumble about 
inflation, the SARG seems confident that there will be no 
increase in bread prices resulting from this year's poor 
harvest.  Local experts tell us that wheat is the one 
strategic crop about which the SARG has a "psychological 
complex," dating from Syria's dependence on foreign grain 
donations in the 1980s.  The status of Syria's strategic 
wheat reserve is a closely-held secret because the regime 
 
views wheat as one pillar of its political independence. 
Consequently, the UAE's pledged gift of wheat is particularly 
significant.  Although the logistical details of this deal 
have not yet been disclosed, the additional wheat should help 
to ease regime concerns over possible shortages and 
breadlines for the next year.
