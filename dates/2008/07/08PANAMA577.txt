¶1. (C) POL met with MFA human rights officer Janio Tunon to 
discuss respect for human rights and the need for democratic 
change in Cuba. POL encouraged Panama to engage in dialogue 
with Cuba and promote the human rights benchmarks set by the 
European Union. Tunon stated that Panama's relationship with 
Cuba was based on commercial ties and trade, asserting that 
Panama would not push Cuba to discuss "sensitive political 
matters." Tunon highlighted that Raul Castro's economic 
reforms demonstrated progress towards a liberal market 
economy, his regime would evolve at its own pace, and Cuba 
would not be influenced by external players.

¶2. (C) Panama is loathed to engage on human rights and 
democratic change in Cuba. Tunon's response to this demarche 
    was a complete regurgitation of Panama's views on its 
engagement with the Cuban regime. While often holding itself 
out as a "valid interlocutor" with the regime, Panama is 
unwilling to carry water regarding respect for human rights 
and the need for democratic change.
