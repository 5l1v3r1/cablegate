Â¶1. (SBU) Poloffs on July 9 delivered REFTEL demarche to 
senior officials in the Ministry of Defense (Brigadier 
General Munoz Castresana in the office of the Secretary 
General for Defense Policy) and Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
(Deputy Director General for Arms Control Ignacio Sanchez), 
and shared with them our new policy on cluster munitions. 
The demarche came just as Spanish Defense Minister Carme 
Chacon announced in Congress that Spain planned to accelerate 
its compliance with the terms agreed to at the May 30 Dublin 
meeting of the Oslo Process on conventional weapons and 
destroy its cluster munitions arsenal "in the near future." 
Defense Minister Chacon reiterated this policy change during 
her July 17 appearance before the Congressional Defense 
Commission.  Nearly 5,000 units reportedly are to be 
destroyed beginning later this month and this step would make 
Spain the first country to prohibit cluster munitions and 
destroy its arsenal.  Post understands the Spanish Chief of 
Defense was not consulted on his government's decision before 
it was announced.  The Spanish Air Force has in the past used 
these types of munitions for aircraft runway denial and is 
the branch of military service most likely to be affected.
