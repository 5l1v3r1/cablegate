¶1. In response to reftel, Econoff delivered talking points to 
New Zealand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT). 
MFAT's initial response was favorable to both the candidacy 
of the United States to the Council of Administration (CA) 
and Postal Operations Council (POC) of the Universal Postal 
Union (UPU) and the GNZ supports the policy of continuing 
zero nominal growth disciplines in the UPU budget. MFAT has 
subsequently responded to demarche through diplomatic note. 
Text of DipNote follows in para 2.  The DipNote has also been 
emailed to IO/T - Chris Wood. 
¶2.  Begin text of diplomatic note: 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade presents its 
compliments to the Embassy of the United States of America 
and has the honour to advise that the Government of New 
Zealand will support the candidatures of the Government of 
the United States of America for election to the Council of 
Administration (CA) and the Postal Operations Council (POC) 
of the Universal Postal Union (UPU) at the elections to be 
held during the 24th UPU Congress in Geneva from 23 July to 
12 August 2008. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade has the further 
honour to advise that New Zealand is also seeking re-election 
to the Postal Operations Council at the upcoming UPU 
Congress.  The Government of New Zealand would greatly 
appreciate the support of the Government of the United States 
of America for New Zealand's candidature. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade takes this 
opportunity to renew to the Embassy of the United States of 
America the assurances of its highest consideration.

¶3.  While no promises or conditions for obtaining New 
Zealand's support were discussed when demarche initially 
delivered, Post would appreciate any information/instructions 
State can provide in response to GNZ's request for support of 
its candidature to the POC of the UPU.
