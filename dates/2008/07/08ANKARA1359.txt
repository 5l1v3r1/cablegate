In Today's Papers 
 
Erdogan, Baykal Denounce Istanbul Bombings, PKK Denies 
Responsibility 
All news outlets report on Monday, Prime Minister Erdogan and 
opposition CHP leader Deniz Baykal visited the site of the deadly 
bomb attack in Gungoren neighborhood in Istanbul.  Erdogan claimed 
the blasts were in retaliation to the Turkish operations against the 
PKK in northern Iraq.  The PM urged Turkish people to withdraw 
support for "political parties backing terror."   Baykal issued a 
call for a "nationwide campaign against terror, calling for millions 
of Turks to rally together to condemn terror.  Papers report Erdogan 
supports Baykal's idea and would be willing to discuss it with him.. 
 
 
Istanbul Governor Muammer Guler said earlier the attack was an act 
of terrorism.  Papers quote security experts suggesting the attack 
"could have been perpetrated by the PKK," and that intelligence 
units had been expecting a PKK operation "in a big city, especially 
in the aftermath of the Turkish cross-border operations into 
northern Iraq."  Zubeyir Aydar, chairman of the People's Congress of 
Kurdistan (Kongra-Gel,) "strongly condemned" the attack and said 
"the Kurdish freedom movement has nothing to do with this."  Aydar 
said the fact that the attack took place in the midst of  the AKP 
and 'Ergenekon' trials should not be overlooked.  Mainstream Sabah 
reports "allegations" that the PKK-affilianted TAK had accepted 
responsibility for the attack.  Kurdish party DTP leader Ahmet Turk 
warned it was "premature" to point at anyone as the perpetrator, and 
the incident should not be exploited "for political benefits."  Turk 
said the attack was a blow for "peace, coexistence and the future." 
 
 
Papers also speculate the attack's aim was chaos which would lead to 
civil strife in Turkey.  Mainstream Sabah says the Ergenekon 
indictment alleges the possibility of such attacks to stoke tension 
between Kurds and Turks. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Istanbul Bombings 
 
Murat Yetkin wrote in liberal-intellectual Radikal (7/29): "Efforts 
are underway to provoke a conflict between Turks and Kurds.  The 
bombings in Istanbul resulted in a great deal of hatred, and the PKK 
was believed to be the perpetrator.   Even though the PKK 
spokespersons in northern Iraq and Brussels denied responsibility, 
there is an overall perception that this was the work of the PKK. 
Perception is sometimes stronger than the truth and in this case, it 
will be grave if this goes beyond the PKK and people of Kurdish 
origin are held responsible.  We should take a lesson from the past. 
 There is a trap and we should not fall into it." 
 
Ekrem Dumanli wrote in Islamist-leaning Zaman (7/29):  "At this 
point there is no use thinking about who benefited from the Istanbul 
bombings.  Any sensible Turk is well aware of the fact that there 
are many traps.  In this game, those who are responsible for the 
chaos are creating 'savior' or 'heroic' identities for themselves. 
However, Turks are fed up watching various versions of the same 
movie.  And they have come to the point of 'enough is enough' - a 
very good response to chaos plotters." 
 
Court Holds First Hearing on AKP Closure Case 
All papers report the Turkish Constitutional Court, convened its 
first hearing on the AKP closure case on Monday.  The hearing lasted 
12 hours.  Court justices will come together every day until they 
reach a decision.  Papers comment yesterday's long meeting raised 
expectations that the ruling might come earlier than anticipated. 
Under the Constitution, at least seven out of 11 court members' 
votes are needed to close the party. 
 
Editorial Commentary on 'Ergenekon' Probe 
 
 
ANKARA 00001359  002 OF 003 
 
 
Ali Sirmen wrote in leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet (7/29):  "The 
Ergenekon investigation provides both horror and laughter at the 
same time.  Putting inconsistencies and irrelevant accusations 
aside, so many horrifying stories have appeared in certain media 
outlets and they've been presented as truth. The whole thing is 
portrayed as going after the deep state.  If this is the genuine 
desire, state transparency is the only way to achieve the goal. 
Let's take the murder of Hrant Dink.  It is presented as a deep 
state act.  This proposition deserves only laughter.  It is 
certainly the responsibility of the State to prevent something like 
Dink's murder from happening.  The State's failure is that, almost 
deliberately, it did nothing to prevent the Dink murder.  Yet the 
responsible figures are still in public service: Chief of Police, 
Police Intelligence Chief, Istanbul Governor and others.  They are 
not hiding in the deep.  Let's deal with the shallow state first 
before going after the deep one." 
 
Kurds Attack Turkmen Office after Deadly Bomb Attack in Kirkuk 
All papers report 32 people were killed Monday when a female suicide 
bomber struck a Kurdish rally in the city of Kirkuk in northern 
Iraq.  The demonstrators attacked the Iraqi Turkmen Front (ITF) 
building and Turkmeneli TV station in the city after the attack. 
Demonstrators set the ITF office on fire and abducted five people, 
according to ITF officials.  Islamist-oriented Zaman reports Ankara, 
worried about the developments, advised the Turkmen to "keep calm." 
ITF's Turkey representative Ahmet Muratli said Kurds held the 
Turkmen responsible for the attack, and claimed some want to incite 
fighting between the Kurds and Turks. 
 
Babacan to Tehran July 29 
Milliyet, Sabah, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Zaman and Yeni Safak report 
Foreign Minister Ali Babacan will travel to Tehran on July 29 to 
participate in the Non-Aligned Movement summit talks. 
Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet expects Babacan to continue Turkey's 
"facilitator" role between Washington and Tehran regarding Iran's 
nuclear program through contacts on the sidelines of the summit. 
Babacan will also lobby UN member states attending the meeting for 
Turkey to gain a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council, 
according to Cumhuriyet. 
 
Paper: Ahmadinejad to Visit Turkey August 14 
Liberal Radikal reports Iranian President Ahmadinejad will travel to 
Turkey on August 14 on a working visit.  Radikal says Ahmadinejad 
and Turkish President Abdullah Gul are expected meet in Istanbul, 
which would excuse the Iranian President from visiting Anitkabir, 
the mausoleum of Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey.  In the 
past, visiting Iranian officials declined to visit Anitkabir, which 
caused public anger in Turkey. 
 
Iran 'Intermediates' for Improving Turkey-Armenia Ties 
Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak reports Kaan Soyak, the co-chair of 
Turkey-Armenia Business Development Council, said Iran wants to 
"help" in improving ties between Turkey and Armenia.  "For the first 
time, regional countries including Iran plus the Minsk Group members 
want Turkey-Armenia border reopened and ties between the two 
countries normalized," Soyak said.
