SUBJECT: NICARAGUAN CUSTOMS TAXES FTZ TRASH 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: Apparel and furniture manufacturers complain that 
in March 2008, Nicaraguan Customs began to tax fabric scraps and 
trimmings disposed of in local landfills as "exports," levied upon 
an arbitrary value based on weight.  The government has temporarily 
backed off this new trash tax after manufacturers complained 
directly to President Ortega.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Apparel and furniture manufacturers recently complained to 
Econoff that in March 2008, Nicaraguan Customs (DGA) began to tax 
fabric scraps and trimmings disposed of in local landfills as 
"exports."  One furniture manufacturer, Justin Westbrook, reports 
that DGA had attempted to impose a charge of $0.50 per kilogram. 
Rather than pay what would amount to $9,000 in taxes per month on 
his trash, Westbrook began to store his waste in an unused part of 
his manufacturing facility that he had planned to bring into 
operation this year.  Westbrook said the fee would put his company, 
Mubletex, out of business. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Scott Vaughn, President of the Nicaraguan Textile and 
Apparel Manufacturers Association (ANITEC), argued that the waste 
produced by his company and others has no commercial or transaction 
value and should therefore not be subject to taxation when removed 
from the Free Trade Zones (FTZs) in which they operate.  His 
company, Rocedes Apparel, faces waste disposal fees of $2,000 a 
month.  He reports that the local DGA officials plan to assess a 
$0.10 per kilogram tax on his trash.  Vaughn and Westbrook complain 
that, without a transaction value on which to base customs duties or 
VAT, DGA authorities have assigned arbitrary tax rates based on 
weight.  They report that these rates vary widely, depending on the 
manufacturer. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Edmundo Guerrero, the DGA representative for the FTZ where 
Westbrook operates, argues that Muebletex' waste does indeed have 
value as it is often removed from landfills by scavengers who later 
use the scraps and trimmings to stuff mattresses and weave rugs.  In 
a June 2008 meeting between ANITEC and DGA leadership, DGA Deputy 
Director Wilfredo Altamirano argued that Technical Circular 100/2006 
authorizes them to collect duties and VAT on waste.  Econoff 
received a similar explanation from DGA staff in response to June 
2008 letter to DGA Director Eddy Medrano. 
 
¶5. (SBU) At the June meeting between ANITEC and DGA, ANITEC 
Executive Director Dean Garcia countered that the circular requires 
manufacturers to submit monthly reports to DGA detailing the type 
and quantity of fabric disposed of and the mode of disposal, but is 
silent on the mode of disposal and the collection of taxes and fees. 
 Free Trade Zone Commission Technical Secretary Alvaro Baltodano and 
ProNicarauga Executive Director Javier Chamorro have expressed 
sympathy with ANITEC's position. 
 
¶6. (SBU) In a follow-up conversation with Econoff, Scott Vaughn 
reported that DGA has temporarily backed off on collecting taxes on 
trash after a group of FTZ investors brought the issue to the 
attention of President Ortega in late June.  However, Vaughn 
believes formal repeal of the tax is unlikely, given the 
government's constant search for creative ways to maintain leverage 
over FTZ companies.
