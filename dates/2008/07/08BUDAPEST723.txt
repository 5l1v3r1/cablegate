¶1. (SBU)  MFA Americas Department Head Szilveszter Bus 
discussed reftel with PolOff on July 22.  Bus commented that 
the recently updated EU Common Position opens a new chapter 
in EU/Cuba relations.  While Hungary supported the lifting of 
sanctions - stating that the embargo was/is not successful - 
Bus stressed that "it is important to have review mechanisms 
as well as dialogue with pressure."  He views "new" freedoms 
to have cell phones, or visit seaside beach resorts, as 
"something going on in the country, but not real reform." 
Bus said that Hungary will remain as active in Cuba as in the 
past, "working behind the scenes in Havana within the context 
of the Trans-Atlantic relationship while facilitating unity 
with the EU." 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Bus noted that their Ambassador and DCM in Havana 
regularly invite opposition leaders to their residences for 
meetings.  He commented that the Embassy outreach program to 
the opposition includes distribution of DVDs and cameras, as 
well as plans for a fall film festival focusing on the 
Hungarian transition to democracy.  Queried as to any 
pushback from the Cuban Government on relations with the 
opposition, Bus stated that their quiet diplomacy keeps doors 
open to the Cuban Government, "a much more effective approach 
than the shouting of the Czechs, who don't have any dialogue 
with the Cubans." 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Within the EU framework, Bus noted that Hungary 
worked hard on the final EU Common Position text, in 
particular, to soften the "the Council is encouraged" 
language desired by Spain to the more nuanced the "Council 
notes the changes."  In closing, Bus said the MFA looks 
forward to continued cooperation with the U.S. in moving the 
Cuban democracy agenda forward.
