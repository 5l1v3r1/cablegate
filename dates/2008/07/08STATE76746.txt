REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Embassy Wellington and AIT 
Taipei's assistance in conducting a post-shipment check on 
license 05-050095335 for the export of 16L401-21; SHIM to 
Taiwan and on license 05-050097129 for the export of spare 
parts for multiple aircraft platforms to Taiwan.  Embassy 
Wellington and AIT Taipei are requested to complete this Blue 
Lantern check within 45 days.  Lack of response to a Blue 
Lantern check will affect pending and future licenses 
involving parties to these licenses. 
 
¶3. Reason for request:  Questionable routing to Taiwan via 
New Zealand and unfamiliar foreign intermediate consignee, 
Custom Aeronautical Solutions (CAS). 
 
¶4. ACTION AIT Taipei: Department requests that AIT contact 
the Taiwan MOD and verify its order for the items listed on 
both license applications and provide information of its 
relationship with the New Zealand company CAS. 
 
END ACTION AIT Taipei. 
 
ACTION Wellington: Department requests that Embassy conduct a 
site visit to Custom Aeronautical Solutions (POC: Emma Niu, 
Sales Manager, Tel #:  64 3 355 2223, Email: 
emma@customaero.co.nz) in order to assess its business 
operations, on-site security, and general reliability as a 
recipient of United States Munitions List (USML) items.  The 
following questions are offered as suggested guidance with 
CAS: 
 
- Can the company provide documentation from the Taiwan Air 
Force, the Taiwan Naval Logistics Command, and the Taiwan 
Army Logistics Command (e.g. purchase order, contract, or 
letter of intent) establishing them as the final end users of 
these items? 
 
- What is the company's exact role in these transactions? 
 
- Who are the company's main clients? 
 
- Does the company keep proper, detailed records of its sales 
and customers? 
 
- Does the company understand the restrictions on United 
States Munitions List (USML) articles, particularly regarding 
re-export and retransfer? 
 
If a site visit is not possible, please inform PM/DTCC case 
officer.   End Action Wellington.
