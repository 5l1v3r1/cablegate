KBR/U.S. MILITARY 
 
¶1. (U) On July 1, Head of the Gulf Department at the MFA, Dag 
Juhlen-Dannfelt, contacted poloff to protest the breach of 
Sweden's diplomatic compound in Baghdad by KBR contractors 
and the U.S. Military.  According to a report sent by 
Sweden's security contractor Control Risks, the perimeter 
defenses were breached on two sides on June 28 to allow 
passage of a vehicle convoy.  A KBR contractor allegedly 
verbally abused the Swedish security team, per the Control 
Risks report. 
 
¶2. (U) Juhlen-Dannfelt said Sweden's Ambassador to Iraq 
Niclas Trouve will contact Amb. Crocker to further discuss 
the issue.  We sent the detailed report via email to NB 
Director Robert Gilchrist and Special Assistant to Amb. 
Crocker, Ali Khedery.
