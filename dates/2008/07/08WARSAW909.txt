SUBJECT: ANTARCTIC TREATY: POLAND MAKING PROGRESS ON 
ADOPTION OF ATCM MEASURE 1 
 
REF: STATE 74080 
 
(SBU)  EconPff delivered reftel demarche to Jakub T. Wolski, 
of the MFA's Legal and Treaty Department, on July 25.  Wolski 
stated that Poland has been making progress on approving 
Measure 1 (2003) of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting 
(ATCM).  The major roadblock has been translating the large 
number of documents associated with the measure.  They 
finished translation of all the required materials in June 
2008, and now only need to forward the documents to the 
Council of Ministers for final approval.  Barring any 
unforeseen problems, Wolski anticipated that Poland would be 
able to approve Measure 1 by September 2008. 
 
(SBU)  Econoff and Wolski briefly discussed the U.S.-hosted 
32nd ATCM, scheduled for April 2009, particularly with 
respect to approving Measure 1 well before the conference. 
Wolski anticipated that Poland would likely be represented at 
Minister level at the 2009 ATCM.  To ensure the highest 
possible level of participation, he requested additional 
details regarding the conference, including logistics and a 
recommendation for the optimal dates for Ministerial 
participation.
