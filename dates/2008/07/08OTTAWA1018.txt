REF: SECSTATE 80675 
 
¶1. (sbu) Canada strongly supports the U.S. idea of broadening 
free trade agreements and cooperation in the western 
hemisphere, Department of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade (DFAIT) Senior Advisor in the Americas Strategy 
Secretariat Rouben Khatchadourian told Econcouns on July 30. 
Responding to reftel points, Khatchadourian said Canada also 
favors greater hemispheric integration and is "playing catch 
up with the United States" in Latin America in this regard. 
 
¶2. (sbu) Khatchadourian was already aware of the U.S. 
proposal to hold an FTA leaders summit around the UNGA time 
frame.  He stated that he would send our request to the 
Foreign Minister's office, adding that Canada would likely 
support an FTA initiative/meeting, especially at "the right 
time and right level."  Khatchadourian confirmed that Prime 
Minister Harper would address the UNGA on September 25, but 
would likely be unavailable on September 23-24.  Brazilian 
President Lula is tentatively scheduled to make a state visit 
to Canada on those dates, Khatchadourian said.  He asked that 
we keep Lula's visit close hold.
