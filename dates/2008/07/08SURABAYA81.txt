¶1. (SBU) Summary: During a July 4 visit to Surabaya, Ambassador 
Hume discussed the prospects for enhanced education cooperation 
between the U.S. and Indonesia with local officials, academics, 
and business leaders.  All stressed the importance of 
establishing necessary infrastructure and institutions to take 
full advantage of educational exchanges and highlighted the need 
for practical skills that reflect economic development 
realities.  Business leaders pointed to a need for vocational 
training aimed at local conditions.  The Surabaya-Seattle Sister 
Cities representatives identified educational exchanges as one 
of three priorities for future cooperation.  The Ambassador 
offered to support local efforts to develop public-private 
partnerships for education and cultural exchanges and noted the 
interest of Seattle-based businesses and organizations in 
increased cooperation with Indonesia.  End Summary. 
 
Educational Exchanges 
--------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) In a roundtable discussion with Ambassador Hume, 
Surabaya businessmen and academics highlighted the importance of 
domestic reform and increased cooperation with U.S. institutions 
to strengthen Indonesia's educational system.  With only 7,000 
PhDs, Indonesia is at a disadvantage when competing for 
high-value investment or taking advantage of available exchange 
programs.  As an example, Ambassador Hume noted that the 
Ministry of Health had only nominated three qualified people for 
20 training slots in the United States.  Kacung Marijan, a 
professor of political science at Airlangga University, noted 
that while the constitution mandated 20 percent of the national 
budget be spent on education, it wasn't simply a question of 
throwing government money at the problem.  Priority should be 
placed on strengthening educational institutions and 
infrastructure to ensure that schools and universities were 
better prepared to take advantage of exchanges of people and 
ideas. 
 
Private-Public Sector Paradigm 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Ambassador Hume stressed that both Indonesia and the 
United States must benefit from institutional exchanges.  If 
not, projects will die on the vine.  He highlighted the 
importance of a private-public sector paradigm by which the 
government plays a facilitating and coordinating role that 
allows many types of interaction, exchanges, cooperation to take 
place smoothly and effectively.  For example, Stanford sends 
roughly 15 students a year to study in Indonesia, a program it 
runs without USG or Indonesian Government involvement.  Wibisono 
Hardjopranoto, Rector of Surabaya University, agreed, noting 
that three Yale University students were currently in Surabaya 
studying the economic impact of the Sidoarjo mudflow.  They had 
contacted Surabaya University directly through the internet. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Kresnayana Yahya, Director of Enciety Consultants, 
stressed that education exchanges could be improved by focusing 
on projects that have a real impact on society and the lives of 
students.  He suggested that the local Brantas river management 
project would benefit from examining the Tennessee Valley 
Authority and how it manages water supply issues across state 
borders.  Frank Pandji, Director of PT Mepoly Industry Corp., 
stressed that vocational education had to target economic 
realities in a given area.  It made no sense, he argued, to 
provide vocational training that did not match local industries 
or employment needs. 
 
Seattle-Surabaya Sister City Association 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶5. (SBU) In a separate meeting with Ambassador Hume, the Vice 
President of the Seattle-Surabaya Sister City Association 
(SSSCA) said Surabaya city government officials had identified 
educational exchanges as one on three priority areas for 
cooperation.  The other two priorities are urban transportation 
planning and training of health care professionals and health 
care institution building.  The University of Washington has an 
excellent teaching hospital that could partner with its Surabaya 
counterparts.  The Ambassador offered to write a targeted letter 
of support for the SSSCA's efforts highlighting the lifting of 
the travel warning and encouraging public-private partnerships. 
There are a number of large, Washington state-based corporations 
with current of potential equities in Indonesia including 
 
SURABAYA 00000081  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
Boeing, Starbucks, Microsoft. (Note: Los Angeles and Jakarta 
have a sister-city relationship, which we are looking to expand. 
According to the Indonesian Consul in San Francisco, California 
and Yogyakarta have a sister-province/state relationship, which 
Indonesia is hoping to rejuvenate.)
