Deported UK Citizen Admitted to Illegal Activities 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶2. At the July 10, 2008, regular MFA press briefing, MFA Spokesman 
Liu Jianchao said that Dechen Pemba, a UK citizen deported from 
Beijing July 8, is a leading member of the Tibetan Youth Congress, a 
"separatist organization," and has "admitted to committing 
activities that are against Chinese law."  Her admission of guilt is 
a "hard fact."  This incident has "nothing to do with the Olympics," 
added Liu, asking that specific questions be referred to the 
relevant department. 
 
Six-Party Talks to Discuss Verification Mechanism 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶3. Asked about the possibility of a "verification mechanism" being 
agreed upon during this week's Six-Party Talks Heads of Delegation 
meeting, Liu said he believes "the issue will be discussed."  Liu 
stated that the Talks are focused on how to implement the remaining 
"Second Phase actions," and that the MFA would brief the press in 
due time. 
 
Media Freedom During the Olympics 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶4. China might not satisfy "some requests" of the press for "some 
reasons," said Liu when asked about guarantees of media freedom 
during the Olympics.  China will do its best to grant requests, and 
Liu will convey reporters' requests to the relevant authorities. 
The Beijing City Government, BOCOG and the entire Chinese Government 
have the same aspiration, which is to have the "perfect Olympic 
Games."  Asked why journalists will be allowed access to Tiananmen 
Square only at certain times, Liu replied that Tiananmen can expect 
"large loads of tourists" and "big activities" during the Games. 
 
Sarkozy Visit, French FM Comments 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶5. The Dalai Lama issue is an internal affair of China and China's 
position on the Tibetan issue is consistent and clear, said the 
spokesman when asked about the French Foreign Minister's reported 
comments in response to Chinese criticism of his meeting with the 
Dalai Lama.  Asked how China would handle Chinese public protests 
during President Sarkozy's visit to China, Liu said that he thinks 
the Chinese people will show hospitality to all foreign guests. 
Commenting on France's recent efforts to improve bilateral 
relations, the spokesman said he hopes China and France can turn a 
new page in relations, maintain a long-term perspective and overcome 
difficulties. 
 
Terrorism in Xinjiang 
--------------------- 
 
¶6. The facts prove that there are terrorist organizations in 
Xinjiang that engage in terrorist activities, said Liu when asked 
about overseas Uighur groups' doubts of the facts surrounding an 
alleged raid on terrorists in Urumqi July 8.  Liu told reporters to 
contact public security authorities with specific questions 
 
BEIJING 00002701  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
regarding the incident.  "East Turkestan" Islamic terrorist groups 
have links to forces inside and outside China, stated Liu.  He 
acknowledged seeing reports in the Chinese media today that Chinese 
police have detained 82 suspected terrorists in the first half of 
2008, adding that the Chinese Government is "very solid" on this 
issue (reftel). 
 
Many Efforts to Solve Darfur Crisis 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶7. China has made many efforts to solve the Darfur crisis, including 
contributing peace-keeping forces to Darfur.  China hopes to solve 
the crisis and to help the people of Sudan overcome difficulties and 
have peaceful lives and development, said Liu when asked if China is 
satisfied with the situation in Darfur.  China supports the 
"dual-track" approach, which seeks to implement the UN and African 
Union consensus and work for conciliation through negotiations. 
Sudan is a friend of China, he stated. 
 
Visit: Montenegrin FM 
--------------------- 
 
¶8. Montenegrin Foreign Minister Milan Rocen will visit China July 
15-16 at the invitation of FM Yang.
