REF: STATE 71296 
 
¶1.  (U) This is an Action Request -- See Para 6. 
 
¶2.  (U) SUMMARY:  Mission has conveyed reftel invitation re 
the upcoming nuclear safeguards workshop to the Indonesian 
Department of Foreign Affairs (DEPLU).  DEPLU expressed 
interest in sending Indonesian participants and asked whether 
USG funding was available to help defray costs.  Mission 
requests Department of Energy's review of possible assistance 
in para 6.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  (U) Dep/Pol/C conveyed to DEPLU contacts reftel 
invitation for Indonesia to send two to three participants to 
the workshop on next generation nuclear safeguards taking 
place in Washington, September 11-12.  Dep/Pol/C explained 
the challenges facing the international safeguards system and 
the importance of continuing to strengthen those safeguards. 
 
¶4.  (U) Our GOI contact expressed interest in the workshop. 
Andy Rachmianto, Deputy Director for International Security 
and Disarmament at DEPLU, remarked that Indonesia had been 
among the first countries to implement previous generations 
of nuclear safeguards and wanted to stay at the forefront in 
the next generation as well.  He said he would convey the 
invitation to colleagues at the Indonesian Nuclear Regulatory 
Agency (BAPETEN), as specifically requested in reftel. 
 
¶5.  (U) Noting that most agencies had recently experienced 
sharp budget cuts because of rising food and fuel prices, he 
asked whether any USG funding was available to help defray 
the costs of participation.  Dep/Pol/C said he would check. 
 
¶6.  (U) ACTION REQUEST:  Mission has checked DOE's website re 
the workshop and found no information on funding.  Mission 
strongly supports the invitation to Indonesia, which has a 
good record on nuclear safeguards and takes these issues 
seriously.  Any funding that can be made available would be 
well spent.  We would appreciate a review of this request in 
the near term so that we can get back to DEPLU.
