SUBJECT: DIRECT FLIGHTS RESUME BETWEEN RUSSIAN FAR EAST AND ALASKA 
 
¶1.  Despite high prices, uncertain schedules and a good deal of 
behind-the-scenes wrangling between U.S. and Russian officials, 
direct flights between the U.S. West Coast and Pacific Russia 
have resumed, courtesy of the Russian carrier Vladivostok Avia 
(VladAvia).  On July 7, the first flight from Vladivostok to 
Anchorage via Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy was successfully 
completed, carrying a light load of Russian passengers.  The 
return trip is expected to be full of American tourists heading 
to Kamchatka to see its geysers, volcanoes, hot springs and 
other natural wonders. 
 
¶2.  Behind the scenes, U.S. Transportation Safety Administration 
(TSA) officials have been doing what they can to cope with 
last-minute planning on the Russian side and Kamchatka's 
rudimentary infrastructure.  Due to a late notice, the TSA had 
to scramble to assemble a team to complete an inspection of 
Petropavlovsk's airport in time for Monday's inaugural flight. 
Obtaining a quick turnaround on visas turned out to be another 
hurdle, although the Consulate and VladAvia officials did their 
best to speed the process.  Finally, the Consulate has had to 
intervene to ensure that an electronic funds transfer makes it 
through to Petropavlovsk so that the TSA team can pay their 
hotel bills. 
 
¶3.  Despite such difficulties, the potential for trade and 
tourism is enormous, especially as the Russian Far East gears up 
to host the 2012 APEC summit by  modernizing its transport and 
business facilities and adding a range of casinos, western 
hotels, and other attractions to complement the already famous 
trans-Siberian railroad and the region's natural beauty.  The 
American Bar Association and VladAvia are joining the Consulate 
in sponsoring a student essay contest on the future of 
U.S.-Russian relations to highlight the flights.  The winner 
will receive a free VladAvia roundtrip ticket to Alaska.  The 
state Governor's office and the University of Alaska have agreed 
to help support the visit with tours and educational 
programming. 
 
¶4.  Comment:  Based on the difficulties in getting these flights 
off the ground, appears there are some in the Far East who are 
not quite ready for normal U.S.-Russian relations, an attitude 
that, if unchecked, may hinder the flights from developing 
fully.  However, with every trip to the United States by a 
Russian student, businessman, or tourist, Russia becomes just a 
little more likely to realize its vast potential for partnership.
