SUBJECT: T LETTER OF THANKS TO CANADIAN FINANCE OFFICIAL 
FOR PSI 5TH ANNIVERSARY PRESENTATIONS 
 
REF: STATE 023570 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY AND BACKGROUND:  Robert Sample, Senior Economist, 
Department of Finance Canada, gave a presentation at the 
Senior-Level Meeting for all states endorsing the 
Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) held May 28, 2008, in 
Washington, DC, on the occasion of the PSI's Fifth 
Anniversary.  Sample's presentation covered proliferation 
financing, during the panel on efforts to strengthen 
international frameworks that support the PSI.  The PSI 
Senior-Level Meeting was attended by representatives of 85 
countries, almost all of the 92 states that have endorsed the 
PSI. 
 
¶2.  On May 29, 2008, the United States hosted a PSI Outreach 
Workshop in Washington, attended by representatives of 21 
countries that have not yet endorsed the PSI, as well as most 
of the PSI participating states.  The workshop provided 
detailed information on the broad range of PSI activities and 
tools that have been developed for training, organizing for, 
and conducting interdictions of shipments of proliferation 
concern.  Robert Sample also gave a presentation on 
proliferation financing at this workshop.  (Copies of 
presentations can be forwarded upon request.) 
 
¶3.  ACTION REQUESTED:  Embassy is requested to deliver under 
appropriate cover the following letter from Acting Under 
Secretary John Rood to Department of Finance Senior Economist 
Robert Sample, thanking him for his presentations at the PSI 
Fifth Anniversary Senior-Level Meeting and Outreach Workshop. 
 The State Department does not plan to release the text of 
this letter but has no objection if the Government of Canada 
wishes to do so.  There will be no signed original. 
 
¶4.  Begin text of letter: 
 
Dear Mr. Sample: 
 
On behalf of the U.S. Government, I want to thank you for 
your presentation on proliferation financing, given in the 
panel on efforts to strengthen international frameworks at 
the May 28, 2008 Senior-Level Meeting for Proliferation 
Security Initiative (PSI) participants in Washington DC. 
Your presentation made an important contribution to the panel 
and the meeting overall, covering a key element of the 
international legal framework to counter WMD-related 
trafficking. 
 
I also would like to thank you for giving the presentation on 
proliferation financing at the May 29, 2008 PSI Outreach 
Workshop, geared toward briefing non-PSI states and PSI 
endorsing states that have not participated regularly on this 
critical issue. 
 
I believe the PSI Fifth Anniversary Senior-Level Meeting was 
very successful in reaffirming the strong commitment of the 
PSI partner states to respond to the WMD proliferation 
challenge.  It also provided the participants from 85 
countries an opportunity to strengthen communication with one 
another.  We hope this event will result in expanded 
participation in PSI activities, particularly on a regional 
basis.  The United States recognizes that Canada plays a 
significant role in the PSI, and we greatly appreciate your 
Government's continued efforts and contributions to advancing 
the PSI goals. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
John C. Rood 
Acting Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and 
International Security
