An Institutionalized Savagery 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S.Paulo (7/01) says: "Robert 
Mugabe, the hero of Zimbabwe's independence movement, could have 
been for his country what Nelson Mandela was for South Africa, but 
instead became a second Idi Amin.  Essential for the future of the 
new Idi Amin is the position of South Africa's president Thabo Mbeki 
who has been giving signs of exasperation with the tyrant. It is 
unlikely that South Africa, as well as Russia and China, will 
support economic sanctions against Zimbabwe, and much less the 
sending of the UN's blue helmets.  But it would be considered a 
victory if the African Unit, with the support of South Africa, 
declared illegitimate the sixth mandate of Mugabe and put pressure 
[on Mugabe] for new elections."
