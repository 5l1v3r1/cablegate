REF: A. PARIS 1293 
     Â¶B. STATE 69644 
 
(SBU)  Following transmission of ref A, we received 
additional comments on ref B demarche from MFA desk officer 
Thierry Caboche on July 9.  He said that France shared the 
USG's concern for the humanitarian and food crises plaguing 
the Horn of Africa.  He noted that France had doubled its 
humanitarian assistance to Somalia ("a priority for us"), 
amounting to 3.5 million euro (USD 5.5 million) for 2008. 
Concerning a possible supplementary contribution, Caboche 
said that a decision on a second tranche of food aid (which 
would take into account all other regions of the world) for 
2008 would be made in the autumn of 2008.  At that time, he 
said, the MFA's AF Bureau would be competing with the 
priorities of the MFA's other offices for resources, but that 
the AF Bureau would make the case for additional assistance 
for the Horn of Africa, "taking into account the very grave 
humanitarian situation in the region."
