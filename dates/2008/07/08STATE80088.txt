SUBJECT: DEMARCHE REQUEST ON NATO MEMBERS AND ASPIRING 
MEMBERS' PARTICIPATION IN NAM MINSTERIAL 
 
REF: STATE 74879 
 
¶1. (SBU) The department requests that action addressees 
pursue the following objectives with regard to host 
government's potential attendance at the upcoming Non-Aligned 
Movement (NAM) Foreign Ministers meeting in Tehran, July 
27-30, 2008.  Posts should: 
 
-- Determine from host governments whether they have any 
plans to attend, whether if as observers or as guests, and 
strongly discourage host governments from attending. 
 
-- If host governments have taken a firm decision to attend, 
urge them to avoid any appearance of supporting Iran's 
failure to comply with its NPT, IAEA, and UNSC obligations 
with respect to its nuclear program and more generally NAM 
positions at odds with interests of the NATO alliance. 
 
-- Urge host governments that will participate in the meeting 
and that have officially recognized Kosovo to lobby other 
states to recognize Kosovo as soon as possible. 
 
¶2. (U) Posts may use their discretion in delivering this 
demarche if they understand that host government has no plans 
to attend the NAM ministerial.

Background and Talking Points 
---------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) The NAM Foreign Minister's meeting is scheduled to 
take place 27-30 July 2008 in Tehran, Iran.  NAM positions 
are often opposed to U.S. policies and interests and more 
broadly to NATO members' policies and interests.  The draft 
final document prepared in advance of this meeting contains 
objectionable language on the Middle East, terrorism, 
religious freedom, and human rights, among other topics. 
NATO members or states that seek NATO membership should 
understand that they are indeed "aligned," and that their 
attendance, particularly at senior levels, is inappropriate 
and sends the wrong message to the international community 
and to their own publics.  We are particularly concerned 
regarding attendance of this meeting in light of  Iran's aim 
to enlist continued NAM support for its attempts to defeat 
international efforts to halt its attempts to develop a 
nuclear warhead. 
 
¶5.  (U) Posts may draw on the following points in making this 
demarche to host governments.   Posts may also draw guidance 
from reftel, which goes into detail regarding Iran's attempts 
to enlist NAM support for its nuclear program. 
 
-- As an ally, we urge you not to participate in this 
meeting, as NAM positions often run counter to the interests 
of NATO. 
 
-- Attending this meeting in Tehran signals the wrong message 
to the Government of Iran at a time when we are seeking to 
maintain international unity and increase pressure on Iran to 
comply with its Non-Proliferation Treaty, International 
Atomic Energy Agency, and UN Security Council obligations. 
 
-- If you do participate, we urge you to avoid any actions 
that would imply support for the Government of Iran. 
 
-- (For states that have recognized Kosovo) We also urge you 
to use the opportunity to advocate for other states to 
recognize Kosovo.
