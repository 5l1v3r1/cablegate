¶1.  (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- Please 
handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Mission has been funding and actively 
working with The Asia Foundation (TAF) on its Islam and Civil 
Society (ICS) program.  The program--which recently 
ended--was designed to strengthen key Islamic organizations 
in their efforts to engage Indonesia's Muslim majority 
population in the development of democracy and civil society 
in Indonesia.  Most observers believe the program has been a 
great success in bolstering moderates and serving as a 
counter to extremists.  Though this particular USAID-funded 
program has ended, TAF--and Mission--remain heavily engaged 
in working with moderate Muslim groups.  END SUMMARY. 
 
A PROGRAM ASSISTING MODERATE MUSLIMS 
 
¶3.  (SBU) TAF program directors and other officers recently 
outlined its ICS program to Mission.  The just-completed ICS 
program received nearly US $11 million administered by USAID 
since its inception.  The program, according to observers, 
has been highly successful in strengthening the role of 
moderate Muslim organizations in Indonesia, engaging civil 
society and ultimately acting as a counter to extremist 
groups. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) One aspect of TAF's success with the program was to 
adapt quickly to local sentiment and conditions.  The 
program's original focus was to foster the spread of a 
moderate form of Islam that worked with democracy.  However, 
after 9/11, TAF--which was taking a bit of a confrontational 
approach to counter Islamists--came under fire from Islamic 
groups who began to distrust its intentions.  At around this 
time, for example, TAF published a moderate Muslim magazine 
meant to specifically counter the radical message being 
spread in "Sabili"--a conservative Islamic magazine.  TAF was 
threatened by many hardline groups and eventually ceased 
publication of the magazine. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) In consultation with Mission, TAF soon re-evaluated 
its strategy and approach and began to center its efforts on 
the promotion of democracy and good governance, through 
poverty reduction, education, and women's empowerment.  This 
new strategy resulted in TAF being able to reach out and 
partner with Islamic organizations in almost every area of 
its programming.  The link with these organizations provided 
TAF local credibility, moral authority, and the nation-wide 
structure of these well-established Islamic mass 
organizations.  TAF engaged in significant reform efforts 
through bringing Muslim leaders together and mobilizing 
Islamic boarding school (pesantren) networks.  These networks 
developed into avenues that allow Muslim leaders and Islamic 
boarding schools to dialogue and share information. 
 
KEY ASPECTS OF THE EFFORT 
 
¶6.  (U) As part of the program, TAF engaged in extensive 
media outreach and training programs.  The following are a 
few recent examples of each: 
 
--Production of a short film entitled "Islamic Philanthropy 
and Social Development in Contemporary Indonesia."  Purpose: 
raise public understanding of Islamic philanthropy and its 
use in the pursuit of social justice. 
 
--Twice-monthly radio and television talk show.  Purpose: 
Discuss civic participation in conflict prevention. Partner: 
Center for Religious and Cultural Studies, Gadjah Mada 
University. 
 
--Publishing a monthly supplement for a local magazine. 
Purpose: Showcase themes associated with Islam and

development issues.  Partner: The Wahid Institute. 
 
--Training 60 Islamic school students on various issues 
including regional legislation and conflict prevention. 
Partner: International Center for Islam and Pluralism. 
 
--Holding a national conference on Islam, good governance, 
and poverty in Indonesia for more than 200 representatives 
from Islamic organizations, local government, NGOs, 
universities, and the media.  Partner: Ma'arif Institute. 
 
--Conducting public discussions on 38 campuses in major 
cities throughout Indonesia meant to broaden student 
perspectives on civic rights in contemporary Indonesia. 
 
A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Most observers believe the program has been a great 
success in bolstering moderates and serving as a counter to 
extremists.  TAF's unconventional approach of spreading 
moderate Islam indirectly through promoting economic 
development and good governance was counter to methods used 
by other groups.  This approach, however, has successfully 
gained the trust and support of the two largest Muslim 
organizations in Indonesia, Muhammadiyah and Nahdlatul Ulama, 
organizations whose joint membership exceeds 75 million 
Muslims.  Though this particular USAID-funded program has 
ended, TAF--and Mission--remain heavily engaged in working 
with moderate Muslim groups.
