¶1. Summary.  The Indonesian National Defense Forces Headquarters, 
Strategic Intelligence Agency (BAIS) confirmed receipt of 
telecommunication equipment listed in reftel and that they are being 
used for the purpose stated on the license.  We conducted a site 
visit to Indonesian firm PT Ciptaarta Hadikara (Cipta) and it 
appears to be a reliable recipient of United States Munitions List 
(USML) items. End summary. 
 
¶2. We contacted BAIS Deputy Purchasing Officer Lieutenant Colonel 
Eddy Noviar on June 12 to verify the transactions detailed in 
reftel.  Noviar confirmed that BAIS received all items listed on 
each of the licenses.  He verified that Cipta is a registered 
company on the BAIS supplier list.  Noviar said BAIS has other 
current contracts with this company. 
 
¶3. We visited Cipta on June 20 and met the Director Aristotle SE and 
his staff Otok Bimo Widagdo to verify the order of items listed in 
reftel.  Aristotle confirmed his company received the order from 
BAIS in 2006 and that the items had been shipped in three shipments 
and received by the end-user in March, April and August 2007. 
Aristotle provided us with contract documentation signed by BAIS and 
Cipta and delivery reports of each shipment.  Aristotle said his 
company was aware of restrictions on USML articles, particularly 
those that are re-exported.  Aristotle said his company never mixes 
USML items with other products at the request of the end-user.  The 
intermediate consignee shipped the items directly to BAIS.  BAIS 
used its own expediter to pick up the items from the airport and 
deliver them to the BAIS warehouse. 
 
¶4. Cipta was established in 1995 as a trading company.  Since 
inception, the company's core business is supplying military 
electronic and communications equipment.  Since 2002, the company 
has been acting as the Indonesian principal for Harris Corporation, 
a U.S. based company.  Their customers include BAIS, Indonesian 
Navy, Indonesian Army and Indonesian Air Force.  According to 
Aristotle, Cipta has submitted two other export license applications 
to the Department of State this year.  Both export licenses are to 
procure similar telecommunication items from Harris Corporation 
ordered by BAIS.
