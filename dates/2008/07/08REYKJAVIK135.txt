Deputy Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Communications Halldor 
Kristjansson on July 10 and followed up with a diplomatic note. 
Kristjansson commented that many others are seeking Iceland's 
support at the UPU Congress and he could not comment on whether or 
not Iceland will support U.S. objectives at the Congress. He said

delegation, along with a representative from the Ministry for 
Foreign Affairs.
