CAMPAIGN WHILE REFOCUSING ON LIBERATING REMAINING HOSTAGES 

PARIS 00001331  001.2 OF 002

¶1. (C) SUMMARY: A Board Member of the Committee in Support of 
Ingrid Betancourt told Poloff on July 11 that former 
hostage/presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt will focus 
her energy on securing the release of all remaining FARC and 
ELN hostages in Colombia and he strongly hinted Betancourt 
would run again for the Colombian presidency in the 
indeterminate future.  Thankful for USG efforts to help win 
the release of the 15 hostages on July 2, Hugo de Coulomme
singled out Ambassador Brownfield, WHA/AND and even latecomer 
Embassy Paris for their assistance to the families of the 
American hostages.  Betancourt is scheduled to receive the 
Legion of Honor Award in Paris on French National Day on July 
14, and will host a concert/rally also in Paris on July 20. 
END SUMMARY. 


Background 

¶2.  (C) On July 11 Poloff met in Paris with Hugo de Coulomme, 
member of the board of directors for the newly renamed 
Committee With Ingrid Betancourt in Support of the Colombian 
Hostages (formerly known as the Committee in Support of 
Ingrid Betancourt).  Coulomme is a dual UK/French national 
who joined the Committee in January 2008.  Not part of the 
broader international coalition of FARC and ELN hostage 
support committees, Coulomme said the Committee will remain 
independent and enjoy its status as "the key group" with 
direct access to Ingrid and the Betancourt family. 


Continuing fight for those left behind 

¶3.  (C) Coulomme said he was flattered to have been the main 
point of contact when Jo Rosano, mother of Marc Gonzalves, 
received the news while visiting Paris that her son was freed 
with 14 other hostages on July 2.  He thanked Embassy Paris 
and WHA/AND for their responsiveness and assistance to help 
reunifyRosano with her son in the U.S.  Coulomme said the 
Committee will continue its work, in lockstep with Ingrid 
Betancourt, to secure the release of the remaining FARC and 
ELN hostages still in captivity in Colombia.  The Committee 
is currently in a state of flux but is working on a strategy 
to redirect its efforts on the hostage issue, he said.  More 
importantly, the Committee is in regular contact with 
Betancourt, her children Melanie and Lorenzo 
Delloye-Betancourt, and her ex-husband, FabriceDelloye, who 
all remain active in the re-focused movement. 


Sarkozy, France, and the USG: Praise all around 

¶4.  (C) Coulomme believed French President Sarkozy played an 
important role in securing Betancourt's release.  Political 
posturing aside, Coulomme claimed Sarkozy "really pushed" the 
hostage issue to the forefront of French foreign policy.  He 
contrastedSarkozy,s activism which he believed was even 
more effective than his predecessor Jacques Chirac.  As far 
as the Colombian military operation on July 2 went, Coulomme
said he and other Committee members were "not convinced" the 
operation was purely Colombian; he said the Committee 
believed "it was obvious" there was substantial USG support, 
and he wanted to know more about the USG role in the rescue. 
That aside, he said the families of the American hostages -- 
who the Committee claims to have been in touch with all along 
-- were very thankful for USG efforts on their sons' behalf. 
Of particular note was Ambassador Brownfield, whom Coulomme
said really made an effort to reach out to the families.  The 
Committee also praised Arizona Governor Bill Richardson's 
work on the issue this past year. 


Upcoming Events: Concert and Honors 


PARIS 00001331  002 OF 002 


¶5.  (C) Ingrid Betancourt was planning to return to Colombia 
to take part in a demonstration to be held on July 20 in 
Bogot.  But after consulting with her family -- who are 
against her immediate return to Colombia -- Betancourt 
decided to stay in Paris for the time being.  "Ingrid is 
extremely tired," said Coulomme.  "She wants to relax and 
regroup," he claimed.  Coulomme cautioned that although 
Betancourt has wavered on announcing any aspirations for the 
Colombian presidency, she confided to him that her future 
plans will "definitely involve Colombia."  The Committee, in 
coordination with several unnamed Colombian non-profit 
organizations also working to bring attention to the 
hostages, will instead host a concert and rally for 
Betancourt also on July 20 in Paris, which will be broadcast 
simultaneously via satellite with the Bogot event. 
Colombian singer Juanes has tentatively agreed to perform. 
Coulomme said Betancourt will make an appearance and give a 
speech at the event.  On July 14, she will be a guest of 
honor during French National Day celebrations, and is to 
receive the Legion of Honor award later that day at the 
Elyse. 


Request for Meeting with Embassy Paris 

¶6.  (C) Coulomme said that in the next few weeks Betancourt 
has expressed interest in meeting with Embassy Paris 
officials.  He said she would like to discuss USG efforts to 
secure the release of all remaining hostages still in 
captivity in Colombia. 


Comment 

¶7.  (C) Although Coulomme is untested and a relative newcomer 
to this effort, he strongly indicated that Betancourt will at 
some point seek the Colombian presidency.  He noted that like 
many politicians, Betancourt has been unwilling to show her 
hand, especially so soon after being released.  That aside, 
he believed she is mostly concerned with timing and whether 
President Uribe will be able to successfully change the 
constitution to run for a third term.  And if she does choose 
to run, she already enjoys an established international 
support network that could morph into a campaign structure.
