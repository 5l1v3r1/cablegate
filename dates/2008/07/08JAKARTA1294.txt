SUBJECT: G8 - YUDHOYONO TO SOLICIT USG SUPPORT FOR WORLD OCEANS 
CONFERENCE 
 
¶1. (SBU) President Yudhoyono will convey an aide memoire on the 2009 
World Ocean Conference (WOC) to President Bush and other world 
leaders during next week's G8 Summit in Japan, as part of an effort 
to solicit international support and high-level participation at the 
May 2009 event.  The Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (DKP) 
has prepared the aide memoire on the WOC, which Indonesia is hosting 
in Manado, North Sulawesi, from May 11-15, 2009.  The Government of 
Indonesia would like the WOC to serve as the backdrop for a Summit 
Meeting of Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI) country leaders, who will 
officially adopt the CTI Action Plan and "kick off" its 
implementation. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The centerpiece of the WOC is intended to be a "Manado 
Ocean Declaration" - an agreement stressing the role of the oceans 
in regulating climate change and the importance of safeguarding the 
function of oceans as an effort to mitigate and adapt to climate 
change.  DKP sources indicate that they are open to advice and 
suggestions in formulating a substantive declaration, to develop 
agreement on needed action to address ocean impacts of climate 
change (next steps beyond emissions controls).  The declaration is 
also intended to attract the high-level participation that the GOI 
wants at the WOC and CTI Summit.  The text about the declaration and 
its rough outline are reproduced verbatim below: 
 
Manado Ocean Declaration 
------------------------ 
The Manado Ocean Declaration (MOD) is a commitment between nations 
to address the impacts of climate change on the way of life and 
livelihoods in and on the sea, the coast and small islands. 
 
The MOD will consist of 3 parts: preamble, body, and 
recommendations. 
 
Preamble: 
The preamble will refer to amongst other things to the Convention on 
the Law of the Sea 1982 (UNCLOS), especially in relationship to the 
protection and conservation of the marine environment and the 
obligation to cooperate, at both regional and global levels. 
 
Body: 
The body will make statements about the two-way relationship between 
climate change and the oceans, including drafting a number of 
solutions (adaptation and mitigation) for addressing the current 
impacts and those which will or are predicted to occur in the 
future. 
 
Recommendations: 
The recommendations section will contain ways in which the 
declaration can be translated into action, in the form of 
opportunities for the international cooperation which is needed such 
as: research, exchange of data, capacity building, transfer of 
knowledge and technology, substantial financial support, and so on.
