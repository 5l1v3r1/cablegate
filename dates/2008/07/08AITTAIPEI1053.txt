SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: TAIWAN'S DIPLOMACY 
 
Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused news 
coverage July 17 on the crash of a Taiwan army AH-1W Super Cobra 
attack helicopter; on the government's relaxation of regulations 
governing cross-Strait matters; and on Tropical Storm Kalmaegi.  In 
terms of editorials and commentaries, an op-ed in the 
pro-unification "United Daily News" said that, given that 
cross-Strait relations are in different circumstances from before, 
Taipei should be wise about diplomatic competition with China, and 
perhaps President Ma Ying-jeou should for the United States' help in 
consolidating Taiwan's diplomatic relations with Paraguay.  End 
summary. 
 
"Contest-of-Wits Diplomacy, Using Wisdom to Find Ways" 
 
Chen Yu-chun, a Taiwan academic and now a senior research fellow at 
China's Tsinghua University, opined in the pro-unification "United 
Daily News" [circulation: 400,000] (7/17): 
 
"... [Taiwan's President] Ma Ying-jeou is set to visit South America 
in August to consolidate [Taiwan's] diplomatic relations with 
Paraguay.  However, the degree of difficulty in terms of handling 
[the task to consolidate Taiwan's relations with Paraguay] is 
formidable.  The leftist Paraguayan government which is about to 
take office has great interest in establishing diplomatic ties with 
Beijing.  [What if] new [Paraguayan] President [Fernando Lugo] 
proposes the request [of establishing diplomatic ties to Beijing]; 
can Beijing reject the request?  Can Taipei lambast this as 'China's 
suppression' [of Taiwan's diplomacy]?  On the other hand, [the 
prospect for Taiwan's diplomacy] is not dim at all.  Maybe Ma could 
win using the 'Nicaragua model,' in which Nicaragua suspended its 
establishment of diplomatic ties with Beijing but strengthened 
practical economic and trade relations with China.  Recently, there 
has been an argument that the United States is suspending arms sales 
to Taiwan in order not to sabotage the atmosphere on the eve of the 
Beijing Olympic Games.  Another argument alleges that Taipei took 
the initiative to suspend arms procurement from the United States in 
order to maintain improving cross-Strait relations.  If the latter 
argument is true, Ma will have room to maneuver, because showing 
goodwill to reconcile [with China] may make Beijing persuade 
Paraguay to suspend the establishment of diplomatic ties [between 
China and Paraguay].  On the other hand, Ma could ask for the United 
States' help by using leverage on Paraguay, more or less, because 
the United States has military bases in Paraguay. (sic) ..."
