SUBJECT: UNAMID'S REPORTED FAILURE TO MOVE 3000 CONTAINERS 
 
¶1. (SBU) UNAMID has over 3000 containers in Port Sudan and El Obeid, 
Kordofan waiting for transportation to Nyala, Darfur, according to a 
UNAMID administrative officer.  At least half of these are in El 
Obeid.  According to the officer and to other sources in the NGO and 
diplomatic community in Khartoum, the delay in transporting the 
containers has absolutely nothing to do with GOS obstruction or a 
lack of security escorts. It is almost entirely due to UNAMID weak 
logistical capabilities. UNAMID procurement is simply incapable of 
cutting the necessary contracts with local transportation companies 
to move the containers.  Internal financial controls and bureaucracy 
as well as slow payment mechanisms prevent UNAMID from cutting the 
necessary deals.  The German Ambassador noted to CDA Fernandez on 
July 27 that "unlike WFP, UNAMID won't pay in cash, and pays late, 
they expect Sudanese truckers to have bank accounts." The UNAMID 
officer said there are plenty of trucks available; it's just that 
the local contractors won't work at the prices offered and given the 
late payments.  The officer thought it unlikely that additional help 
from headquarters would improve the situation. What is required is a 
top-down decision to make this happen and find a way to "bend the 
system to local circumstances rather than making the local system 
bend to UN bureaucracy." 
 
¶2. (SBU) Meanwhile, WFP is able to transport hundreds of trucks into 
Nyala each month.  A WFP logistical officer observed that UNAMID 
should never have signed single contracts from Port Sudan all the 
way to Nyala.  WFP splits it into two contracts because one group of 
transport companies have trucks that go from Port Sudan to El Obeid 
on paved roads, and another group of companies have smaller off-road 
capable trucks that go from El Obeid to Nyala.  WFP agreed that 
UNAMID has problems with delayed payments as well (and probably 
should create a mechanism to be able to pay with cash up front,) but 
said there is also a lack of trucks that can transport 20 foot 
shipping containers.  (WFP doesn't ship containers and is therefore 
able more flexible and able to use smaller trucks.)  So either 
UNAMID must buy some trucks to move all these containers, or create 
a contract that will allow a local company to buy the necessary 
trucks.  WFP also suggested that UNAMID should consider moving the 
containers via train, since there are trains that go from Port Sudan 
to Nyala and from El Obeid to Nyala.  A final suggestion was for 
UNAMID to consider unpacking the containers and breaking the 
shipments into smaller sizes, though TCCs and UNAMID may not be 
willing to have their containers opened.  "UNAMID needs some 
logisticians rather than procurement officers," noted the WFP 
officer. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The WFP officer also noted that even if UNAMID can manage 
to move 300 containers a month (a rapid rate given the current 
capacity of roads and transport companies,) it will take a year to 
move the current back-log.  UNAMID had requested assistance from WFP 
in moving their containers for them, but ultimately WFP decided it 
was too much of a mess and "too politically risky" to become 
involved. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment: UNAMID has a very serious and embarrassing problem 
on its hands, one that it is not currently capable of solving. It is 
much easier for DPKO to posture and hide behind the false image of a 
uniformly malevolent Sudanese regime obstructing the UN at every 
turn. Instead of seeking advice first on the best method to get the 
containers to Nyala, UNAMID signed contracts that local companies 
are not able to complete.  The fact that UNMIS has a logistical hub 
in El Obeid made this a logical place to send containers when UNAMID 
was just getting started, but now it is stuck with 1500 containers 
in El Obeid that it cannot easily move.  New contracts on transport 
by train seem possible, combined with repackaging of the contents of 
some containers (those that can feasibly be repackaged for smaller 
trucks) as well as finding a way to both improve the road to Nyala 
and increase the capacity of transport companies by signing new 
contracts to help them buy the necessary trucks.  UNAMID won't be 
able to do this cheaply nor without pursuing creative solutions, 
something that the current UNAMID administrative and procurement 
apparatus seem incapable of doing.  This is not to say the problem 
can be easily solved; we warn against berating UNAMID as this is a 
seriously complicated logistical issue that requires greater 
capacity and attention than UNAMID is currently capable of 
dedicating, but at the very least one would have thought they could 
have availed themselves of the hard-won experience won by other UN 
agencies such as WFP.
