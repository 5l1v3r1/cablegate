SUBJECT:  AFGHAN VOTER REGISTRATION 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The Afghan voter registration process is moving forward. 
The Independent Election Commission (IEC) presented its operational 
plan and budget to donors, who responded positively; commitments 
received cover the total proposed budget of $101.5 million (led by 
the USG's $65 million and with additional contributions from Great 
Britain, Germany, Canada, Norway and Sweden).  The registration 
process is planned in four phases starting October 6 (with those 
areas expected to be most affected by winter snows addressed first) 
and procurement of materials, recruitment of registration staff, 
training, and public outreach/information campaigns are ready, 
pending signing of a USAID/UNDP agreement to obligate funds.  UNDP 
was selected by UNAMA to manage the registration process, and they 
did this successfully in 2005 (though with administrative and 
financial management weaknesses that have now been addressed).  It 
is urgent that this program move forward as quickly and effectively 
as possible to permit elections to proceed on schedule. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) UNDP has submitted to USAID a program budget and work plan 
for the registration effort: we have reviewed them and found them 
satisfactory.  In addition, USAID and UNDP have agreed to include 
additional measures to provide close and effective oversight of the 
program to ensure sound management.  Both UNDP and USAID are anxious 
to proceed quickly, to meet urgent procurement timelines necessary 
to keep the elections time-table on track. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Post will proceed to sign the agreement with UNDP and will 
work closely with them to support and implement this 
presidential-priority program.
