Olympics Should Not Be Politicized 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶2. The Olympic Games should not be politicized, and any attempt to 
interfere in China's internal affairs by politicizing the Olympics 
is doomed to failure, MFA Spokesman Liu Jianchao said at the regular 
bi-weekly MFA press conference July 3.  Heads of state and other 
dignitaries are invited by the relevant National Olympic Committee, 
he said. Asked a follow up as to why the Chinese Government has 
invited heads of state independent of the National Olympic 
Committee, the spokesperson responded that he had already said 
enough on procedural matters. Asked for comment on Sarkozy's plan to 
announce whether he will attend the Olympics next week, the 
spokesperson said the he had answered the question Tuesday and had 
no further comment, nor could he comment on a potential meeting 
between Sarkozy and Chinese President Hu Jintao on the margins of 
the upcoming G-8 summit. The spokesperson likewise had no 
information on whether Kim Jong-il will attend the Olympics. 
 
Mongolian Unrest: China Hopes for Stability 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  China has taken note of the recent unrest in Mongolia, Liu said. 
 As a friendly neighboring country, China hopes to see a stable 
Mongolia.  The spokesman had not heard of tightened border security 
following the unrest. 
 
China Is a Rule of Law Country 
------------------------------ 
 
¶4. The spokesman had not heard of a specific case of "an American 
convicted 10 years ago for tax evasion in Shanghai" (Note: the 
journalist was referring to the case of Jude Shao), and could not 
comment on his recent parole.  He noted, however, that China is a 
country that abides by the rule of law and that all such cases are 
handled within the bounds of Chinese law. 
 
G-8 Agenda: Not Political 
------------------------- 
 
¶5. The G-8 is an international conference of 16 nations, Liu said. 
The agenda is agreed on by all and is not political in nature. 
 
Dalai Lama Meeting: No Information 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶6. Asked for the results of the meeting between the Chinese 
Government and the Dalai Lama, the Liu responded that he too is 
waiting for news. 
 
Six-Party Talks: No Date Set 
---------------------------- 
 
¶7. No date has yet been set for a Six-Party Talks heads of 
delegation meeting.  Liu expressed hope that the relevant parties 
can agree in the near future. 
 
Visit: Mexican President Calderon, July 7-12 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶8. VISITS: Mexican President Felipe de Jesus Calderon will visit 
Beijing and Shanghai July 7-12, and will meet President Hu Jintao, 
Premier Wen Jiabao and Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi. This will be 
Calderon's first visit to China. In 2003, China and Mexico 
established a strategic partnership. Cooperation between the two is 
mutually beneficial, as both are developing nations.
