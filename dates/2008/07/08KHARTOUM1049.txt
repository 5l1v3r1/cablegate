INDICTMENTS AGAINST SUDANESE REGIME 
 
REF: KHARTOUM 1046 
 
¶1. (SBU) One day before the anticipated announcement by the ICC of 
indictments against senior Sudanese regime officials, Khartoum 
remains calm but the city is rife with rumors and speculation about 
what will happen and how the regime and other political forces in 
the country will react to the indictments.  As just one example, on 
July 10 rumors raced across the city and even reached Juba and El 
Fasher that another Darfur rebel attack on the capital was imminent 
and that a rebel column was within 100 kilometers of the capital. 
This rumor even made it into the local news media but ultimately 
turned out to be false.  The SPLM held an emergency meeting of its 
Political Bureau July 11 to discuss options in response to likely 
NCP actions following the indictments (septel).  Many keen observers 
including UN officials speculate that rebel forces and even possibly 
the SPLM could take advantage of the indictments to undermine the 
regime, but it is still too early to tell. 
 
¶2. (U) Khartoum residents anticipate demonstrations against the 
indictments both the day of the announcement (expected at 2 pm local 
time July 14) and the following day.  There was a small and 
peaceful, apparently impromptu demonstration July 13 at midday which 
moved from the bus stop north of the chancery toward the Presidency. 
 Sudanese press July 13 highlighted statements by Sudan's ambassador 
to the Arab League (which will hold an emergency session regarding 
the indictments) and the African Union Peace and Security Council 
rejecting the indictments.  President Bashir will lead an emergency 
meeting of his Cabinet the afternoon of July 13 to review possible 
responses to the indictments.  First Vice President Salva Kiir flew 
from Juba to Khartoum July 13 to attend the meeting. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In anticipation of possible strong reactions by the regime 
against the UN (UNSCR 1593 instructs the ICC to investigate war 
crimes in Darfur), UNAMID has evacuated all non-essential civilian 
staff from Darfur and moved to level IV security.  In Khartoum, 
UNMIS raised its security level from II to III and has evacuated 
some non-essential civilian staff and told staff who are on leave to 
delay their return by several days.  Non-peacekeeping UN agencies 
such as UNDP and WFP have been told to evacuate their families, and 
non-essential staff at these agencies have been evacuated.  (Note: 
UNMIS and UNAMID staff are not supposed to have family members in 
country and those that do, against UN guidance, have been asked to 
remove their families. End note.)  A/SYG Jane Holl-Lute arrived in 
Khartoum July 12 ostensibly to cover for SRSG Qazi (who is on leave 
due to a family medical emergency) but senior UN staff indicated 
that she is also here in case a major evacuation of UN personnel is 
required.  UNMIS headquarters in Khartoum is prepared to lodge on an 
emergency basis all 1000 UN civilian staff that remain in town, if 
required.  UNMIS also established an alternate command center in 
Juba (which immediately prompted false rumors that UNMIS was 
planning to move all operations to Juba). 
 
¶4. (SBU) Other western Embassies in Khartoum have essentially 
mirrored the security arrangements and posture of the U.S. Embassy 
(reftel).  Non-essential TDY visitors have been evacuated or told to 
delay their arrival, staff on leave have been encouraged to extend 
their leave by several days, and operations will be at a minimum 
July 14 and possibly July 15. 
 
¶5. (U) There are currently 66 official Americans in Khartoum and 14 
official Americans in Juba.  There are no official Americans in 
Darfur.  The Khartoum airport remains open and some seats on 
commercial flights are available although the number of available 
seats is declining rapidly, according to our travel agent.  There 
are 350 MREs at the Embassy chancery, 168 MREs at USAID, and 45 MREs 
at the RAO annex.  There are 540 liters of bottled water at the 
chancery, 540 liters at USAID, and 100 liters at the RAO annex. 
There is a 96-hour supply of generator fuel at the chancery, a 
72-hour supply at the RAO annex, and a 72-hour supply at the USAID 
annex.  RSO distributed safe haven kits to staff July 11 - 13.  The 
Embassy received and immediately put into use 9 additional armored 
vehicles July 10, which had been ordered by Embassy Khartoum in 
September 2007.  The MFA has not yet provided non-diplomatic plates 
but is working with the police to obtain them (and requested that we 
not read anything into the delay). 
 
¶6. (U) CDA held a comprehensive town hall meeting July 13 with all 
American staff and later held a meeting with the FSN committee.  CDA 
provided an overview of the political situation, reviewed operations 
for the next two days, answered questions, and urged anyone with 
private concerns to see him or section/agency heads.  RSO and MGT 
 
discussed security procedures, preparations and operations 
anticipated over the next few days.  The EAC met again following the 
town hall (septel) to finalize preparation regarding staffing for 
July 14 (minimum core staff only).
