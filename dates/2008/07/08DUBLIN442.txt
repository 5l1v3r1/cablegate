REF: STATE 79278 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) On July 29, 2008 POLOFF delivered reftel demarche to 
Ciara Delaney, First Secretary for Enlargement & Eastern 
Europe in the Department of Foreign Affairs' EU Division. 
Delaney indicated that the outcome of the AKP case will 
strongly influence the EU's treatment of Turkey.  She stated 
that current reports suggest that the verdict will be less 
severe than originally anticipated and that it is likely to 
be announced by end of day on July 29.  The Irish 
Government's preference is that negotiations on Turkey's 
accession are not suspended.  However, the final decision 
will be dependent upon upcoming EU discussions.
