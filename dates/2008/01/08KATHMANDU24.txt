Nepal Will Not Send Delegate to Workshop 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶1.  On January 3, Emboff informed Mani Bhattarai, Section 
Officer for UN and International Organizations at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), of the postponement of the 
detection architecture model guidelines workshop (Ref A) and 
the entry of four additional partner nations into the Global 
Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (Ref B).  Bhattarai 
asked how many countries were now part of the Global 
Initiative and whether the United States would provide 
funding for partner nation travel to the workshop.  Bhattarai 
said the government of Nepal (GON) did not have the money to 
send anyone to the workshop, but perhaps resources for 
similar events would be allocated in the fiscal year 
beginning in July 2008.  The Section Officer also commented 
that his government would have been unlikely to participate 
because the new event date was too close to Nepal's planned 
Constituent Assembly election in April. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶2.  Bhattarai told Emboff the GON had yet to select a Global 
Initiative point of contact, and Emboff could continue to 
deliver updates to him.  Post does not expect the host 
government to designate a technical expert any time soon, 
should one exist.  The MFA has been receptive to receiving 
information about the Global Initiative, but it is clearly a 
low priority.
