OVERSIGHT ISSUES FOR THE PRESS 
 
REF:  PRETORIA 00073 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary.  South African Civil Aviation Authority 
(CAA) CEO/Commissioner Colin Jordaan discussed safety 
oversight and compliance with international aviation safety 
standards during his first interviews with the South 
African media.  Jordaan alerted all airlines during the 
interviews that CAA has "improved its oversight capacity 
significantly".  He identified recruitment, training, and 
retention of qualified inspectors as areas of concern for 
CAA as it continues to improve its oversight capacity. 
Jordaan responded candidly to questions about engine 
failure on a Nationwide flight on November 7, 2007.  He 
remained concerned about long-term recruitment and 
retention prospects despite a successful round of 
recruitment for airworthiness inspectors.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) Jordaan gave an interview with "Classic FM 102.7" 
immediately after receiving the FAA good news letter from 
Economic Counselor on January 7 (reftel).  The interview 
ran later during the evening rush hour.  Jordaan was candid 
about flight safety oversight gaps that had threatened to 
cause a downgrade from Category One.  He was also frank 
about the effects a downgrade would have had on South 
Africa.  Jordaan pledged his commitment to assure the 
maintenance of South African safety oversight standards. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Compliance with International Standards 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) Jordan discussed compliance with international 
aviation safety standards in his first print interview in 
the Business Times on January 13.  (Note: Jordaan joined 
CAA in December 2007, shortly after it announced that the 
positions of CEO and Commissioner would be merged into one 
position, bringing the CAA in line with international best 
practices and addressing a shortfall identified in the FAA 
audit).  He told the press that CAA has increased its 
aircraft maintenance standards "over the last eighteen 
months to be in line with (evolving) international 
standards."  According to Jordaan, CAA has "introduced new 
technical guidance materials that have resulted in more 
intensive inspections for maintenance organizations."  CAA 
has hired additional inspectors and enforcement agents to 
keep up with evolving international standards.  CAA 
recently recruited 15 qualified aircraft engineers (from an 
applicant pool of over 100) to act as airworthiness 
inspectors. 
 
------------------ 
Improved Oversight 
------------------ 
 
 
¶4. (U) Jordaan warned all airlines against "cutting 
corners" since the CAA has "improved its oversight capacity 
significantly."  In addition to its audit functions, CAA 
has instituted a new whistleblower program.  A confidential 
aviation hazardous reporting system has been created to 
identify shortcomings that "might be concealed during a 
normal audit."  Under the new program, any airline or 
maintenance organization employee can directly and 
anonymously inform CAA of any violations.  Transportation 
Officer confirmed with CAA General Manager for Aviation 
Security that the whistleblower program was already 
functional.  A confidential aviation hazard reporting form 
is available on the CAA website (http://www.caa.co.za/) and 
can be sent to a dedicated e-mail address 
(CAHRS@caa.co.za).

Q------------------------------------------- 
Recruiting and Retaining Skilled Inspectors 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) Jordaan identified continued recruitment, training, 
and retention of qualified inspectors as an area of concern 
for South Africa.  According to Jordaan, the South African 
Air Force has become a training ground for civilian 
airlines.  He said the Air Force "is battling to train and 
retain" engineers.  Additionally, South African Airways 
(SAA) lost approximately 40 technicians to emigration 
 
PRETORIA 00000115  002 OF 002 
 
 
(mostly to Australia and New Zealand) in 2007.  Jordaan 
emphasized that "as soon as (engineers) qualify they go to 
the airlines or leave the country." 
 
¶6. (U) Jordaan lauded efforts by SAA and other airlines for 
their training and apprentice programs.  However, he was 
candid about the difficulty airlines are having in 
attracting young professionals.  Jordaan stated that 
airline training programs were not attractive to the youth 
population.  He also refuted claims that the demand for 
black pilots was compromising safety.  Jordaan reiterated 
that "black pilots are required to meet exactly the same 
standards as any other pilot." 
 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Response to Nationwide Engine Failure 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (U) Jordaan spoke about the temporary grounding of 
domestic air carrier Nationwide in December 2007.  He 
responded candidly to questions from both the radio and 
print media about engine failure on Nationwide's Boeing 
732-200 on flight CE723 on November 7. Although the 
incident is still under investigation, Jordaan stated that 
the incident would not have occurred if the plane had been 
maintained properly.  He also emphasized that it was the 
only commercial airline accident registered in South Africa 
in 2007 and "was dealt with quickly and thoroughly." 
 
¶8. (U) Jordaan used the Nationwide example to highlight the 
quality of South African pilots.  According to Jordaan, 
annual flight operations inspections by Boeing and Airbus 
rank South African pilots highly. 
 
¶9. (SBU) Comment.  Jordaan expressed his concern about 
long-term recruitment and retention prospects in his 
conversations with both the Embassy (reftel) and the media. 
This is not surprising, since skilled labor shortages exist 
in almost all sectors of the economy.  This is the result 
of inadequate education for the disadvantaged population, a 
rapidly growing economy, and a global skills shortage that 
is attracting many skilled South Africans to accept well- 
paid employment in other countries.  End Comment.
