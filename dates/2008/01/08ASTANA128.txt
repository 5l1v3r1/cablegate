¶1.  (SBU) Econoff delivered Ambassador Donnelly's letter to  Vice 
Industry and Trade Minister Aitzhanova(Reftel A) on January 15 via 
Damigul Kabieyeva, Head of the Ministry's WTO accession department. 
Econoff simultaneously delivered TIFA demarche points (Reftel B) to 
Kabiyeva and her deputy, Saadat Assanseiteva. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Kabiyeva reiterated Kazakhstan's support for the proposed 
TIFA Council Meeting to be held in June/July 2008.  She shared the 
GOK's concerns about the organization of the event in either 
Dushanbe or Ashgabat, and wanted to know if the meeting would 
definitely be held in one of those cities, or if other sites could 
be considered.  She contended that Turkmenistan and Tajikistan's 
limited budgets may impact the effectiveness of the event.  She 
acknowledged, however, that 2008 TIFA Council Meetings held in 
either location might provide a needed economic stimulus.  Kabiyeva 
also inquired whether or not requirements would be made of 
Turkmenistan and Tajikistan regarding the size of their 
participating delegations. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Kabiyeva said that after three years of participation in 
TIFA, the GOK feels that there are few demonstrated results and 
remains anxious to see TIFA and the Council Meetings "go from 
dialogue to practical measures."  Both she and Assanseiteva agreed 
that the theme of streamlining customs processes would be 
advantageous. Kabiyeva strongly supported the involvement of private 
sector representatives and was amenable to facilitating regional 
working groups prior to the Council Meeting. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Kabiyeva recommended creating an established agenda of 
locations and themes for future Council Meetings based on a 
consistent rotating roster of hosts and issues (similar in structure 
to the Eurasian Economic Community.)  This structure, she added, 
would allow for the more effective inclusion of desired private 
sector representatives. Kabiyeva also recommended regular systematic 
meetings held at different levels prior to the Council Meetings, 
organized such that concrete negotiations could be held and 
agreements (such as MOUs between business groups) signed during the 
plenary. Her final recommendation was to invite representatives from 
other organizations involved in similar work (such as the EEC) to 
participate in the meeting. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Kabiyeva noted that she and Vice Minister Aitzhanova have 
not discussed in detail their official recommendations for the 2008 
TIFA Council Meeting.  She promised an official response in writing 
by February 15. Kabiyeva also requested information regarding the 
composition of the proposed U.S. private sector delegation.
