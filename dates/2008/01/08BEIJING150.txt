China and Malawi Establish Diplomatic Ties 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶2. At the January 15 regular MFA press briefing, spokesperson Jiang 
Yu told reporters that China and Malawi decided on December 28 
through friendly consultations and negotiations to establish 
diplomatic relations at the Ambassador level.  The two countries 
share the common task of economic development and common views on 
many international issues, said Jiang.  She added that the one-China 
principle is the consensus of the international community based on 
the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.  She said China is 
ready to establish and develop friendly relations with other 
nations.  Jiang ignored a reporter's question as to why China waited 
more than two weeks to announce the agreement. 
 
¶3. Asked for the MFA's view on Chen Shui-bian's encouragement to 
nations recognizing Taiwan's sovereignty to open "commercial 
offices" in mainland China, Jiang stated that the one-China 
principle is the important, basic principle in dealing with 
questions related to Taiwan and that "relevant" countries must 
follow this principle. 
 
Human Rights and the Olympics 
----------------------------- 
 
¶4. Jiang said some organizations with "ulterior political motives" 
use the Olympics to "tarnish China's image" and "exert pressure" on 
the Government, when asked about the Dutch Government's involvement 
in organizing a discussion of human rights and the Olympics Games. 
Such attempts to politicize the Olympics are "against the Olympic 
spirit and doomed to failure," she added.  "No country in the world 
is perfect," and no country can make "irresponsible remarks" on the 
human rights conditions of other countries.  Since reform and 
opening, China has made great progress in human rights development, 
development to which the Chinese Government is "devoted," stated 
Jiang. 
 
Hu Jia Investigated for "Suspected Offenses" 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. Activist Hu Jia is being investigated "in accordance with the 
law" by the Beijing Public Security Bureau for "suspected offenses" 
and the relevant department will handle the case accordingly, stated 
Jiang when asked for comment on United States concern over Hu's 
arrest. 
 
PRC Assists Crew of Taiwan Ship 
------------------------------- 
 
¶6. The crew members of a Taiwan ship that "encountered danger" near 
Fiji are now safe and in good condition in Fiji, said the 
spokesperson.  The MFA launched an "emergency response mechanism" to 
assist the ship and the PRC Embassy in Fiji worked to coordinate 
rescue work, said Jiang. 
 
India and China Enhance Civilian Nuclear Cooperation 
--------------------------------------------- -------

¶7. In "A Shared Vision for the 21st Century" published yesterday, 
China and India agreed to enhance bilateral civilian nuclear 
cooperation while honoring and respecting international commitments, 
stated Jiang.  China applauds PM Singh's view, expressed during his 
visit, that "the world is big enough" to allow India and China's 
simultaneous development. 
 
ROK Fire, African Democracy, Mao Ads, Six-Party Talks 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶8. Responding to reporters' questions, Jiang confirmed that the 
families of the Chinese victims in the January 7 Republic of Korea 
(ROK) fire have been notified, eighty relatives of the deceased and 
injured are currently in the ROK and the compensation process is 
underway.  Reports of China's protesting of Citroen's use of Mao 
Zedong's image in advertisements run in Spain are not an issue of 
diplomatic affairs, said Jiang, deflecting the question.  "Views of 
the media are views of the media," stated Jiang when asked about a 
People's Daily article pointing to disorder in Kenya as proof that 
Western-style democracy does not work in Africa.  The spokesperson 
had no information on when the Six-Party Talks will restart. 
 
Visits: UK PM Brown, Vietnam FM Pham, ROK Envoy 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶9. UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown will make an official visit to 
China January 18-20.  Chinese-UK relations enjoy good momentum and 
increased exchanges and mutual trust, said Jiang, noting that the 
bilateral trade volume between the two nations is expected to total 
USD 40 billion for 2007.  China hopes the two countries can develop 
a long-term strategic partnership. 
 
¶10. Vietnam Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Pham Gia 
Khiem will visit January 22-26 to co-chair the Second Meeting of the 
Guiding Committee for China-Vietnam Bilateral Cooperation at the 
invitation of State Counselor Tang Jiaxuan.  Pak Geun Hye, special 
envoy to ROK President-elect Lee Myung-bak, will arrive in Beijing 
January 16.  China attaches great importance to Pak's visit and 
specific arrangements are still under discussion, said Jiang.
