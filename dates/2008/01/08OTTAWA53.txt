¶1. (SBU) According to Sudan Desk Officer Suehila Elkateb at 
the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, 
legal prohibitions on providing military assistance to Sudan, 
in place since the 1990s, make it impossible for Canada to 
assist with the JIU program.  Even given the exemptions in 
resolution 1591 for CPA implementation, Canadian law would 
not allow for this kind of program, according to Elkateb. 
She added that Canada does not even have a military attache 
in Khartoum, but relies on a regional officer to cover Sudan. 
 She reiterated that Canada nonetheless remains committed to 
supporting the CPA and has a number of projects in justice 
sector reform, IDPs, and support for AMIS, among several 
others, and recognizes the importance of the JIU program. 
 
¶2. (U) On January 9, Foreign Minister Bernier issued the 
following statement on the third anniversary of the signing 
of the CPA: 
 
"The Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed three years 
ago, on January 9, 2005, but despite progress in key areas of 
the agreement, some of these critical provisions remain to be 
fully implemented.  Canada believes full implementation of 
the Agreement represents the cornerstone of efforts to 
achieve a lasting peace throughout Sudan.  Canada urges all 
parties to negotiate in a spirit of compromise conducive to 
ongoing dialogue and reconciliation.  In this context, Canada 
welcomes the Sudan People's Liberation movement's recent 
decision to recommence participation in the Government of 
National Unity, as well as the Government's announcement of a 
new Cabinet including ministers from the Sudan People's 
Liberation Movement.  Canada also welcomes the January 1 
transfer of authority over peacekeeping operations in Sudan's 
Darfur region from the African Union Mission in Sudan to the 
African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur. 
Canada calls on all parties to the Darfur conflict to pursue 
peace negotiations in good faith."
