SUBJECT: GUIDANCE FOR 9 JANUARY 2008 UN SECURITY COUNCIL 
CONSULTATIONS ON UNAMID 
 
 
PURPOSE:  This is an action request.  The Department asks 
USUN to draw upon the following themes for the United Nations 
(UN) Security Council Consultations on the UN-African Union 
(AU) Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) on 9 January 2008. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
CONDEMN SUDANESE ARMED FORCES ATTACK ON UNAMID AND 
PRESSURE ALL PARTIES 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
--Condemn in the strongest possible terms the attack by 
Sudanese Armed Forces on a UNAMID supplies convoy on 7 
January 2008; consequently we strongly urge the Security 
Council to take further measures as appropriate for such an 
unacceptable attack, including tightening of the arms embargo. 
 
--Stress the urgent need to deploy UNAMID rapidly and push 
for all parties to accelerate UNAMID's deployment. 
 
--Strongly state that attempts by any party, including both 
the Government of Sudan (GOS) and rebels, to derail the 
process or threaten elements of the force will not be 
tolerated. 
 
--Express strong support for further measures if GOS and 
rebel intransigence continues. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
ESPECIALLY PRESSURE THE GOVERNMENT OF SUDAN 
------------------------------------------- 
 
--Express deep concern at the Government of Sudan's refusal 
to accept the full list of troop contributing countries 
agreed upon by the UN and AU.  The GOS must not renege on its 
agreement to cooperate with UNAMID's deployment, including 
acceptance of non-African components in a predominantly 
African force.  The GOS must end its obstruction to allow 
deployment of UNAMID to move forward in full.  This includes 
providing immediate and full approval for all UNAMID TCCs 
regardless of nationality, providing access to necessary land 
and water, granting flight clearances (including at night and 
not limited to medical evacuations), issuing visas in a 
timely manner, and finalizing an appropriate status of forces 
agreement that allows UNAMID the freedoms required to 
implement its robust mandate. 
 
------------------------------------- 
PRESSURE FOR OTHER ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS 
------------------------------------- 
 
--Note that very little of the Heavy Support Package of UN 
assistance to AMIS and UNAMID has actually deployed. 
 
--Urge the UN and troop and police contributing countries to 
accelerate the steps necessary for deployment, particularly 
given the urgency of the situation in Darfur. 
 
--Press the UN to move forward immediately with deployment of 
self-sustaining Ethiopian, Egyptian, and Thai battalions and 
to make provisions (such as camp construction) for those 
units which will require additional support. 
 
--Urge the UN to ensure UNAMID's three principal officers - 
Head of Mission, Force Commander, and Director of 
Administration - maintain a constant presence in Darfur to 
implement UNAMID's rapid deployment. 
 
--Reiterate the call for countries to contribute the 
necessary helicopters and heavy transport units and express 
support for the UN-led 16 January meeting on this issue. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
PRESSURE FOR A CEASEFIRE AND POLITICAL SETTLEMENT 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
--Urge all parties to respect a ceasefire immediately.  Urge 
all parties to cooperate with the UN-AU-led peace process. 
Note that all parties must be held accountable for their 
actions. 
 
POINT-OF-CONTACT:  Grace M. Kang, IO/PSC 202-736-7735. 
 
BACKGROUND:  Although the transfer of authority from the 
African Union Mission in Darfur (AMIS) took place on 31 
December 2007 as required by UN Security Council Resolution 
1769, very little of the Heavy Support Package of UN 
assistance to AMIS and UNAMID has actually deployed. 
Pressure is required on all parties, especially the GOS.
