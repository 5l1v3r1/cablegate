"Weak Results" 
 
Liberal, largest national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo (1/16) 
editorialized: "President George W. Bush concludes today his 
eight-day visit to six Middle East nations with a poor balance 
regarding ambitious US projects for the region.... Bush is still 
trying to compensate for the effects of the invasion in Iraq in 
2003... and he wants to promote a scenario of stability that does 
not lead to further oil price hikes.... The weakness of leaders 
[such as Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian National 
authority's President Mahmoud Abbas] prevents their commitment to 
the concessions necessary to advancing the peace process. In Kuwait, 
Bahrain, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, Bush kept harping on 
the risks of Iran's aggressive regional strategy. But the 
presidential rhetoric was undermined by friendly fire: the recent 
report released by the US intelligence services on the suspension, 
in 2003, of the Iranian project to build a nuclear bomb. Actually, 
Bush has not even achieved much more modest goals such as preventing 
Iran's rapprochement with Egypt, a nation where he will conclude his 
Middle East visit today."
