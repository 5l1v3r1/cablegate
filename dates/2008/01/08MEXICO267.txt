     ¶B. MEXICO 151 
 
¶1.  Deputy PolCouns delivered reftel A points to Lorena 
Larios, Deputy Director of the Foreign Ministry's (SRE) 
Office of International Policy on Human Rights, conveying 
appreciation for GOM interest in the PDG and calling 
attention to the importance the PDG attached to projects that 
aim to improve government services and promote greater 
transparency on budgets and procurement.  Larios took on 
board points but signaled Mexico may still seek to pitch 
assistance on elections with other PDG partners at the 
upcoming Paris meeting. 
 
¶2.  Deputy PolCouns conveyed appreciation for Mexico's 
interest in providing electoral assistance to Iraq but noted 
Iraq had not requested such assistance from the PDG.  As Iraq 
prepares for elections over the next two years, we would 
advise Mexico of opportunities to provide assistance on 
elections as they became available. 
 
¶3.  As of 1/30, Mexico had still not identified who would 
head its delegation to the PDG meeting scheduled for 2/13. 
Larios welcomed the invitation to the small group meeting the 
morning of 2/13 at the USOECD Mission to discuss Chile's 
candidacy as PDG Vice-Chair.  She wondered aloud though why 
Mexico had not been considered a candidate.  Deputy PolCouns 
advised that Chile had apparently volunteered and the U.S. 
was responding positively to that offer.
