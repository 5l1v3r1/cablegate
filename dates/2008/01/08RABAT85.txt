SUBJECT: MOROCCO INVITES OBSERVERS TO GLOBAL INITIATIVE FOR 
COMBATING NUCLEAR TERRORISM CONFERENCE 
 
REF: RABAT 00056 
 
¶1. (U)  Summary and Action Request:  The Moroccan MFA has 
agreed to invite observers to the Global Initiative for 
Combating Nuclear Terrorism Conference (reftel) and has begun 
to send out invitations.  Embassy recommends Department to 
encourage info addressees from invitee countries to 
follow-up, possibly in coordination with Russian and Moroccan 
counterparts. 
 
¶2.  (U)  At COB on January 25, Moroccan MFA Head of United 
Nations Division Azzedine Farhane informed the Embassy that 
the Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) had begun 
sending out invitations for the Global Initiative for 
Combating Nuclear Terrorism (GI) Conference (i.e., 
"Responding to Malicious Acts Involving Radioactive 
Materials"), being hosted in Rabat February 5-7, 2008, to the 
below list of non-GI member countries to come as observers to 
the conference. 
 
¶3.  (U)  While all GI-member states received invitations to 
the conference in early to mid-January, the two co-hosts of 
the GI (i.e., U.S. and Russia) encouraged Morocco (via reftel 
joint demarche) to invite a number of non-GI member states to 
the conference as observers in the hopes of encouraging them 
to become full members of the GI.  The list of observer 
invitees contained the following countries: Algeria, Bahrain, 
Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Mali, Niger, Oman, Saudi Arabia, 
Senegal, Tunisia, and UAE. 
 
¶4.  (U)  The Moroccan MFA informed us at COB Friday, January 
25th, that it had begun sending out invitations to each of 
the respective country embassies in Rabat, via fax, and 
promised to follow-up with hard-copy invitations to the same 
embassies on Monday, February 28th.  According to the 
Moroccan MFA, it will be incumbent upon each invitee country 
embassy in Rabat to inform its government about the 
invitation and to pick appropriate individuals to attend. 
 
 
¶5.  (U)  As noted in the US-Russian Demarche, reaching out to 
countries in the Middle East, North Africa, and West Africa 
reflects both co-chairs' interest in trying to encourage as 
many countries as possible to join the GI, already made up of 
some 60 participating countries.  Toward this end, and to 
assist our Moroccan conference hosts, Embassy Rabat 
recommends that the Department ask embassies in each of the 
invitee capitals to encourage host country participation in 
the GI conference, given the short lead time before the 
conference begins.  Ideally, this could include joint 
demarches with Russian and/or Moroccan embassies.  The short 
time frame, however, may make delivering the message early 
more important than awaiting these arrangements. 
 
¶6.  (U)  In addition to the formal U.S. delegation, Post 
understands that the State Department Coordinator for 
Counterterrorism Ambassador Dell Dailey will make a brief 
visit to the conference on that afternoon of February 7th, 
also to encourage GI membership.
