SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR'S COURTESY CALL WITH CANADIAN AMBASSADOR 
 
 ¶1. (SBU) Summary: Ambassador and Mrs. Fannin met Canadian 
Ambassador Patricia Fortier and her husband Paul Durand, the 
OAS representative in the Dominican Republic, for a courtesy 
call.  Fortier highlighted the GOC's efforts in stabilizing 
Haiti and increased role in fighting crime, as well as areas 
for cooperation in strengthening democracy in the Dominican 
Republic. End summary. 
 
---------------- 
Efforts in Haiti 
---------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Fortier highlighted the GOC's efforts in stabilizing 
Haiti. The GOC has a bilateral agreement with Haiti which 
allocates over $550 million CAD over a five year period to a 
range of education, health, and governance programs.  The GOC 
also has important trilateral projects that involve both 
Haiti and the Dominican Republic.  One such project is a $20 
million CAD watershed project along the border of Haiti ) a 
necessary step to maintaining the stability of Haiti's 
hydroelectric dam. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Other areas of trilateral cooperation involve issues 
such as deforestation and health.  Contrary to popular media 
sources (see e.g., "An Inconvenient Truth") that purport to 
demonstrate a clear demarcation of deforested areas between 
Haiti and the Dominican Republic, Fortier has observed 
deforestation extending well within Dominican territory.  She 
also observed a "mixing bowl" of diseases and health issues 
in the border towns. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Fortier stated the GOC is doing what it can to 
promote cooperation between Haiti and the Dominican Republic, 
despite what she suggested were ludicrous allegations of an 
international conspiracy under which Canada and the United 
States are plotting to unite the two nations of Hispaniola. 
She stated that despite some reports of altercations and 
confrontations between viewers in the film screenings of the 
"Price of Sugar" and "Sugar Babies," Haitians and Dominicans 
agree and cooperate on many issues. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Increased role in fighting crime 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) In response to Ambassador Fannin,s question 
regarding Canadian efforts to combat drug trafficking, 
Fortier stated that, though Canada's military does not 
usually participate in drug interdictions, the GOC is 
cooperating with the British and Dutch in a joint task force 
monitoring over-flights in El Salvador and Honduras.  Fortier 
is concerned with the increase of drug transshipments to the 
Dominican Republic, especially as there are hundreds of 
flights daily to Canada from the Dominican Republic, and 
recent media reports of airport personnel involved in 
smuggling drugs out of airports run by Canadian companies. 
In this vein, Fortier continued that there must also be 
effective border control to reduce smuggling by organized 
criminal groups. 
 
-------------------- 
Areas of cooperation 
-------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Durand stated that the one of the fundamental issues 
in the Dominican Republic is the lack of adequate 
institutions.  Fortier highlighted the deficiency of 
institutional capacity as demonstrated by the GODR's 
obstructionist response to tropical storms Noel and Olga. 
Though USAID and the GOC coordinated relief efforts for 
tropical storm Noel, the GODR impeded their efforts by not 
being forthcoming with information regarding the extent of 
the damages. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Fortier and Durand acknowledged that the populace 
needs to demand and effect change to their institutions. 
Both noted that increased support for civil society 
organizations such as Foundation for Institutionalization and 
Justice (FINJUS) and Citizen's Participation (Participacion 
Ciudadana) is an encouraging step.  Durand warned that, if 
change is not effected, popular frustration could eventually 
foster a Chavista movement similar to Venezuela's. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Durand stated the OAS welcomes an invitation to 
observe the presidential elections and suggested that the 
Canadian, U.S. and other Embassies also need to be vigilant 
for any warning signs of electoral malfeasance.  Ambassador 
Fannin stated early involvement in the electoral process is 
fundamental.
