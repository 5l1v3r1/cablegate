CIVILIAN FOR AFGHANISTAN DELIVERED 
 
REF: STATE 1991 
 
(U) On January 9, we delivered reftel demarche to Albert 
Sitnikov, Counselor in the MFA International Organizations 
office.  On January 11, Sitnikov replied that Russia's 
preferred candidate for the post is former Turkish FM Hikmet 
Cetin.  The GOR is impressed with Cetin's success during his 
tenure as the NATO Senior Civilian Representative to 
Afghanistan from November 2003 to August 2006.  Sitnikov also 
argued that, because Cetin is Muslim, he is more acceptable 
to the Afghan people than Lord Ashdown.
