¶1.  The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Attache, 
Paris, France requests the assistance of the Regional Security 
Office, Freetown, Sierra Leone in support of the investigation of 
Alhaji Kabba SACCOH, a citizen and national of Sierra Leone who is 
believed to have been a previous member of the Revolutionary United 
Front (RUF). 
 
¶2.  SACCOH is identified as follows: 
 
NAME:  Alhaji Kabba SACCOH 
AKA:   Alhaji KABBA SACCOLT 
DOB:   06/19/1972 
SEX:   Male 
ALIEN REGISTRATION NUMBER: 096151096 
HEIGHT AND WEIGHT: 6'0", 175 lbs. 
 
¶3.  SACCOH is presently in removal proceedings in New York, NY based 
on an application that SACCOH filed for 
Political Asylum.  On September 5, 2007, U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection intercepted a DHL package manifested as "newspaper" 
containing documentation illustrating that SACCOH was a former RUF 
member who was responsible for killing, maiming, and burning houses 
in Sierra Leone.  A letter was also included in the shipment 
informing SACCOH that he is wanted in Sierra Leone.  Two Internet 
articles from the "Awareness Times" have also been located, printed, 
and retained.  These articles make similar claims to SACCOH's RUF 
membership. 
 
¶4.  In furtherance of this investigation, the following information 
is being sought from the RSO in Freetown: 
 
* Confirmation that SACCOH was a member of the RUF. 
 
* If applicable, confirm the current status of any active 
investigation(s) in Sierra Leone against SACCOH. 
 
* Confirm if there are any active warrants for SACCOH's arrest in 
Sierra Leone and obtain copies, if applicable. 
 
* Determine if there are any active sources of information such as 
previous RUF members, turncoats, or witnesses who might be able to 
assist in confirming SACCOH's RUF membership. 
 
* If it is confirmed that SACCOH was an RUF member, obtain any 
reports pertaining to atrocities or human rights abuses that SACCOH 
is thought to be responsible for. 
 
* An original copy of "The Spectator" newspaper dated September 3, 
¶2007.  The authenticity of the newspaper previously seized by CBP 
has come into question and it is possible that this newspaper is not 
authentic and was to be utilized by SACCOH in support of his asylum 
case. If the paper seized is not genuine and SACCOH attempts to use 
these or similar documents in future immigration related matters, 
then criminal prosecution will be sought regardless of SACCOH's RUF 
membership. 
 
 
¶5.  Digital images of SACCOH and copies of the previously referenced 
documents to include "The Spectator" and the "Awareness Times" can 
be provided to post under separate cover. 
 
¶6. Please reference ICE Attache Paris case number PA16FR08NY0005 in 
any correspondence. 
 
¶7.  Point of contact: Assistant ICE Attache Richard Jolles, 2 Avenue 
Gabriel # A-225, 75008 Paris, France. Telephone: 33-1-4312-2371; 
fax: 33-1-4562-3639. 
 
¶8.  Thank you for your assistance.
