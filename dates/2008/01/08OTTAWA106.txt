REF: STATE 5276 
 
¶1. (SBU) Department of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade (DFAIT) Deputy Director for the Southeast Asia and 
Pacific Division Evelyne Coulombe told PolOff that Canada is 
taking every opportunity to encourage other governments to 
impose import bans on Burma.  Coulombe said that the DFAIT 
Southeast Asia and Pacific Division director consistently 
emphasizes the need to exert greater pressure on Burma during 
meetings with foreign government officials, and noted that 
Canada is continuing to pressure ASEAN to take a tougher 
stance on Burma.

against Burma in December 2007.  The measures, subject to 
certain exceptions, include: 
 
-- A ban on all goods (except humanitarian goods) exported 
from Canada to Burma 
-- A ban on all goods imported from Burma into Canada 
-- A freeze on assets in Canada of any designated Burmese 
nationals connected with the Burmese state 
-- A prohibition on the provision of Canadian financial 
services to and from Burma 
-- A prohibition on the export of any technical data to Burma 
-- A ban on new investment in Burma by Canadian persons and 
companies 
-- A prohibition on Canadian registered ships or aircraft 
from docking or landing in Burma

docking or landing in Canada and passing through Canada
