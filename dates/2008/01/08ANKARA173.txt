Classified By: CDA Nancy McEldowney for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1. (C) Summary: Greek Prime Minister Karamanlis' January 
23-25 trip to Turkey symbolizes the improved state of 
Turkish-Greek relations.  During his meeting with PM Erdogan, 
the two Prime Ministers focused on how to overcome the three 
most contentious bilateral issues -- Cyprus, the Aegean, and 
minority rights.  Although no final agreements were reached, 
Erdogan and Karamanlis agreed on several new channels of 
dialogue to accelerate the process.  Publicly, both leaders 
praised the new era of good will.  Karamanlis reiterated 
Greek support for Turkey's EU bid and Erdogan made positive, 
yet vague, statements regarding the Ecumenical Patriarch. 
The Turkish media praised Karamanlis for his bravery in 
making the domestically unpopular trip.  The success of the 
visit gives PM Erdogan space to take on several of the more 
controversial aspects of the bilateral relationship in the 
coming months.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (C) While Greek Prime Minister Karamanlis' January 23-25 
trip to Turkey did not result in any formal deliverables or 
public commitments, the visit itself marks an historic step 
forward for the bilateral relationship.  During a 
two-and-one-half hour meeting, January 23, Prime Ministers 
Karamanlis and Erdogan discussed Cyprus, the Aegean, and 
reciprocal minority rights.  MFA Deputy U/S for the Americas 
and NE Mediterranean Haydar Berk told us the two leaders 
agreed that 2008 is a "window of opportunity" to seek 
progress on all three issues.  To do so, the GOG and GOT will 
accelerate exploratory talks at the U/S level on the Aegean, 
increase ministerial engagement on minority rights, and 
enhance maritime and civil aviation cooperation (ref a). 
 
¶3. (C) On Cyprus, Berk noted, the two sides still hold 
differing opinions, but agreed on general principles 
including the need to relaunch the UN process following the 
Cyprus elections.  MFA Deputy Director General for Greece 
Kerin Uras reported Erdogan asked Karamanlis to increase 
pressure on the Greek Cypriots to "constructively engage." 
Karamanlis expressed hesitancy to do so, as previous attempts 
to influence Nicosia had proven counterproductive. 
 
¶4. (C) Overall, Berk characterized Karamanlis' visit as 
successful, noting that both sides tried to focus on "the 
full side of the glass." An informal agreement between the 
Turkish and Greek General Staffs to avoid maritime or 
airspace incidents one day prior until one day after the 
talks allowed the leaders to maintain a positive tone. Berk 
added that the soon-to-be-voted-on Foundations Law will lay 
the groundwork for resolving many of the Greek minority 
property disputes, including Halki. 
 
¶5. (C) At a joint press conference, both leaders spoke of 
increasing good will and cooperation. Erdogan stated that 
political, military, economic, and cultural relations will 
improve in the coming months.  Turkey and Greece will tackle 
"non-problematic" issues first and then progress to more 
contentious ones.  Karamanlis' comments reflected Erdogan's 
positive tone and the potential for greatly improved 
relations.  He repeated his position on Turkey's EU 
membership -- full compliance, full membership. In response 
to press questions, Karamanlis said that, from the Greek 
perspective, the only problem in the Aegean is the issue of 
the continental shelf.  He also urged the GOT to allow the 
opening of the Halki seminary and to recognize the ecumenical 
status of the Patriarch.  Erdogan responded that the GOT was 
"evaluating" the Halki seminary, and that the ecumenical 
issue is an internal matter of the Orthodox Church. 
 
¶6. (C) Before leaving for Istanbul on January 24, Karamanlis 
also met with President Gul and opposition leader Deniz 
Baykal.  Baykal told the press that during his meeting with 
Karamanlis, he expressed support for the Annan Plan and noted 
it would be difficult for a secular state such as Turkey to 
open the door to religious education being provided through 
entities such as Halki seminary.  During a speech to students 
at Ankara's Bilkent University, Karamanlis said "The time has 
come to solve the Cyprus issue.  Nicosia is the last obstacle 
for Turkey with the EU."  In Istanbul, Karamanlis and his 
delegation of 160 Greek businessmen met with representatives 
of the Turkish-Greek businessmen's associations, Economic 
Policy Research Forum of Turkey (TEPAV), and Turkish Union of 
Chambers of Commodities and Commerce (TOBB) to discuss how to 
improve bilateral trade. 
 
¶7. (SBU) The Turkish press warmly received the Greek Prime 
Minister's visit and focused on its symbolism.  One 
journalist optimistically wrote, "the friendship and 
cooperation has begun."  Most major media outlets praised 
Karamanlis for his courage in traveling to Turkey and 
highlighted the gentlemen's agreement to avoid maritime or 
aviation incidents that might have sullied the visit. 
Karamanlis' January 24 meeting with Greek Orthodox Patriarch 
Bartholomew in Istanbul was largely ignored by the press (ref 
b). 
 
¶8. (C) Comment:  Although a few naysayers highlighted 
Karamanlis' public mention of minority issues and the Aegean 
dispute, the vast majority of Turks welcomed the new era in 
bilateral relations.  Erdogan escaped criticism; many 
portrayed him as the consummate statesman.  The success of 
the visit, the absence of incident, and the promise of Greek 
support for Turkey's EU bid should strengthen Erdogan's hand 
domestically, and perhaps allow him to take on in coming 
months some of the more controversial issues that have vexed 
Turkish-Greek relations for years.  End Comment.
