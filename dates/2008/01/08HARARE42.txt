SUBJECT: GOZ BANS MDC MARCH; MDC PLANS TO GO AHEAD 
 
 
¶1.  (U) After granting written permission on January 18 for 
an MDC march on Wendesday, planned to protest the GOZ's 
refusal to implement a new constitution before elections and 
to postpone the electiond date, police yesterday rescinded 
approval.  Police justified their action by claiming 
opposition leaders had violated a pledge to ensure the march 
remained peaceful.  In a press conference later in the day, 
MDC (Tsvangirai faction) secretary general Tendai Biti vowed 
the march would proceed despite the order banning it. 
 
¶2.  (U) Comment.  The planned demonstration is part of series 
of rallies the MDC hopes to hold over the coming weeks.  On 
Sunday, a rally in the high-density suburb of Highfield drew 
over 10,000 people and the MDC was hoping for much greater 
numbers on Wednesday.  The government ban and past government 
action in violently suppressing MDC rallies is likely to 
deter people from participating on Wednesday.  Additionally, 
police will undoubtedly stop people from traveling from high 
density suburbs to the city center where the march is 
supposed to begin. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Comment continued.  The GOZ's action defies the 
spirit of the SADC negotiations by closing rather than 
opening democratic space.  If the government uses violence 
against marchers, this will be a clear signal it intends to 
perpetuate ZANU-PF rule at all costs, and that it considers 
SADC irrelevant.  On the other side, the number of MDC 
members who participate will be a test of MDC organization 
and whether the MDC is prepared to defy government 
repression.  End Comment
