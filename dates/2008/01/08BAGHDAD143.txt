SUBJECT: NINEWA: DROUGHT THREATENS ALREADY STRESSED FARM 
SECTOR 
 
This is a Ninewa Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) message. 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) A late start to the rainy season in the northern 
Iraqi province of Ninewa threatens the province's wheat crop 
and sheep herds in an agricultural economy already suffering 
from tight credit, a lack of fuel and security constraints on 
marketing.  While rains usually begin in late October in this 
potentially productive grain-farming province, Ninewa has 
received only one day of significant rainfall since 
September.  Normal rainfall over this period is on average 
4.2 inches, but this year's rainfall since September has been 
no more than one-quarter that amount.  The PRT is working 
closely with local partners on a long-term transition to 
sustainable agriculture, a sector that could provide rural 
employment and raw materials for a thriving food-processing 
industry.  For this season, though, nothing short of an 
immediate infusion of water and forage would reverse the 
effects of the current drought.  End Summary. 
 
Wheat Planting Reduced, Low Germination Expected 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Early estimates from farmers across the province, 
local and provincial agricultural officials, and Provincial 
Reconstruction Team agricultural advisors are that the rains' 
delay has prompted wheat farmers this year to plant 15-30 
percent less land than usual.  The lack of rainfall during 
the crucial post-planting period may reduce germination of 
this year's already below-average crop by at least 50 
percent.  Farmers said they need rain by the middle of March 
to germinate and sustain any of the seeds they planted this 
season. 
 
Sheep Herds Lack Forage 
----------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) A lack of rain is squeezing sheep herders as well. 
Normal fall and winter forage did not materialize due to the 
last four months' dry weather.  With the current sub-freezing 
night-time temperatures across Ninewa, meaningful amounts of 
forage are now not expected until at least March.  Farmers 
told the PRT that they expect many sheep could die of 
malnutrition before adequate forage is available. 
 
PRT Pursuing GOI, Private Farm Solutions 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) The PRT is pursuing several projects to address the 
credit, fuel and security constraints on Ninewa's farm 
sector.  These initiatives include multi-sectarian rural farm 
associations to share risk on common problems like high input 
prices, expansion of local veterinary programs, increased 
access to micro-loans, and business improvement loans for 
agricultural processors.  Unfortunately, none of these can 
address the short-term lack of rain. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) The lack of rains in Ninewa harms a local 
agricultural economy already depressed by tight credit, a 
lack of fuel and security constraints on marketing.  While 
some parts of the province could farm wheat and barley with 
only rain, others depend on the marginally operational Al 
Jazeera Irrigation System and expensive individual pumps. 
While rains are the only full solution to a failing wheat 
crop and starving sheep, stop-gap measures could include 
increased fuel resources for private irrigation pumps, 
improved veterinary care to combat malnutrition-related 
diseases and delivery of forage from overseas markets.  In 
the long-term, a multi-year transition of marginal cropland 
to pastureland would provide farmers a profitable way to use 
their land without relying on rains to grow grain.
