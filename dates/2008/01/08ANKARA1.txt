¶2. (SBU) Summary.  Energy Minister Guler told the Ambassador 
December 28 that energy issues will continue to play a 
central role in the GOT's domestic and foreign policy agendas 
for 2008.  Guler noted three main priorities:  1) expanded 
investment in the energy sector (to include privatization of 
electricity distribution and generation assets); 2) reduction 
of reliance on Russia through the development of nuclear 
power, acceleration of investment in Iraqi gas and expedition 
of Turkey's efforts on Nabucco; and 3) implementation of 
energy efficient measures.  Referring to Russia's recent deal 
with Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan for a Tri-Caspian pipeline, 
Guler expressed dismay that Russia is "scoring all the 
goals."  Guler said new ideas and new approaches are needed 
to move forward our vision for Caspian energy development. 
Lastly, Guler requested we share information on energy 
efficiency and Turkey's oil, gas and geothermal potential. 
End summary. 
 
Expanding Investment in the Energy Sector 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) In a December 28 meeting with the Ambassador, Guler 
reaffirmed that privatization of Turkey's electricity assets 
is on the agenda for 2008.  In addition to restarting a 
stalled tender process put on hold by July 2007 parliamentary 
elections, Guler said that electricity generation assets 
would also be sold.  In order to expedite preparation, the 
Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MENR) will directly 
implement the tender rather than transfer the process to the 
State Privatization Agency.  (Comment:  The sale of Turk 
Telecom proceeded on similar grounds without the involvement 
of the Privatization Agency.)  The Ambassador commented that 
offering both generation and distribution assets would likely 
increase bidder interest. 
 
Reducing Reliance on Russia 
----------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) The centerpiece of Turkey's strategy to reduce 
dependence on Russia is to diversify its energy mix away from 
natural gas.  Currently, electricity is produced by three 
main sources: natural gas (46%), hydroelectric dams (25%), 
and coal (22%) with the balance from renewables and other 
sources.  Guler said Turkey will encourage investment in 
hydro, wind and geothermal resources.  In addition, Turkey is 
on a fast-track to develop nuclear power (ref A) and will 
offer the first tender in late February.  Guler stressed that 
our energy diplomacy needs to be reinvigorated by new ideas 
and new solutions.  He said one idea might be moving up the 
timeline to build a gas pipeline from Iraq that would twin 
the existing oil pipeline from Kirkuk to Yumurtalik in Turkey 
(outlet to the Mediterranean). Ambassador noted accelerated 
investment in Iraq's gas sector would be good for the world's 
energy balance, as well as for Turkey and Iraq.  Ambassador 
added that 2008 is the time to make a breakthrough on some 
long-standing projects, particularly, the transit of Azeri 
gas through Turkey for the Turkey-Greece-Italy 
interconnector.  Guler said the Italian Energy Minister had 
invited him to the quadrilateral talks on this issue set in 
begin in January (ref B) and he planned to attend. 
Ambassador said if this agreement can be pushed forward, it 
would alter facts on the ground that would affect how Russia 
markets gas to Europe.  Lastly, Guler noted that Turkey would 
expedite its commitments to Nabucco and that new appointments 
to the BOTAS (State-owned pipeline company) board would be 
finalized soon.  (Comment:  With the new appointments, the 
BOTAS board will have a quorum which will likely vote in 
favor of the German company RWE's joining the Nabucco 
consortium.  ref C)

¶5.  (SBU) Action request:  Following up on a request he made 
to U.S. Energy Secretary Bodman (ref D), Guler again asked 
for an exchange of information on energy efficiency.  He said 
the GOT would kick off a public campaign on energy efficiency 
in 2008 and thought the potential for energy savings could 
have as much impact as new investment in the sector.  (Note: 
DOE will host a Clean Energy Technologies Workshop in 
Istanbul January 29-30, which will also include some 
expert-level discussions with MENR's energy efficiency 
directorate, EIE.  Guler also appears interested in policy 
level discussions and is soliciting U.S. experience in 
putting into place policies to encourage energy efficiency.) 
Guler made one additional request for U.S. assistance; he 
asked whether we could share any data or satellite 
information on Turkey's oil and gas reserves or geothermal 
energy potential.  He said he would like to use such data to 
attract foreign investment.  Ambassador said we would take 
both requests back to Washington.  Post appreciates 
Washington's assistance in responding to Guler's requests.
