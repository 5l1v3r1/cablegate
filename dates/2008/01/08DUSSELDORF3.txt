¶1.  (SBU) German federal banking regulators report they have 
placed the Hamburg-based Europe-Iran Commercial Bank 
(Europaeisch-Iranische Handelsbank) under "special supervision." 
 As part of Mission Germany's ongoing dialogue with the Federal 
Finance Ministry in Berlin and Bonn-based German federal bank 
regulators on Iran-related issues, senior German Federal 
Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) officials told 
Duesseldorf Pol/Econ Officer on January 9 that BaFin officials 
have regular meetings with the bank and closely observe their 
business activities, meeting personally with bank 
representatives four to six times a year (significantly more 
than other banks, which tend to receive only one to two visits 
annually).  Our interlocutors added that BaFin requires the 
Europe-Iran Commercial Bank to submit special reports and that 
regulatory officials evaluate their trade financing as well as 
the origin of personal deposits. 
 
¶2. (U) On November 12, 2007, BaFin issued a circular notice 
asking German banks and financial service institutions to take 
into consideration the October 11 Financial Action Task Force 
recommendations on exercising additional due diligence and 
scrutiny on all Iran-related transactions.  Embassy Berlin has 
provided the text of the BaFin circular to Treasury, EEB, EUR, 
and ISN. 
 
¶3.  (U) This message was coordinated with Embassy Berlin and 
Consulate General Hamburg.
