SUBJECT: TURKMENISTAN/IRAN:  NOW THE IRANIANS ARE BLAMING 
THE U.S. FOR CUTTING OFF THE GAS? 
 
REF: A. OSC IAP200801150022 
     ¶B. ASHGABAT 0007 
 
¶1.  (U) Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for public Internet. 
 
¶2.  (U) As Turkmenistan's gas pipelines to Iran remain shut 
off for the second week, both sides have dug in their heels 
in the natural gas war that began just after the new year. 
However, Iran continues to rachet up the stakes.  According 
to a January 15 report from Tehran's Mehr News Agency (ref 
A), the Chairman of the Iranian Majles Energy Committee, 
Kamal Daneshyar, stated that "Of course, American pressure 
may also have influenced Turkmenistan in cutting off the 
gas...but we believe that what lies behind the scenes of the 
gas cut is that Turkmenistan wants to increase the price from 
seven cents to 14 cents."  Daneshyar reportedly also 
indicated that the Iranian government will lodge a complaint 
against Turkmenistan at the international arbitration court. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The Petronas country manager in Turkmenistan, 
Suleiman Abdullah, agrees with reftel analysis that 
Turkmenistan has halted gas flows to northern Iran in a 
hardball effort to force the Iranians to increase the price 
they are paying for Turkmenistan's gas.  Asking, "Have you 
ever tried to negotiate with the Iranians?" Suleiman pointed 
out that it is in Turkmenistan's interest to unify the price 
that it is charging at the border for gas.  Otherwise, he 
suggested, the Iranians will continue to do what they have 
been doing over the last several years:  reselling the gas 
they purchase from Turkmenistan for $65 per thousand cubic 
meters for a much higher price at the Turkish border. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) COMMENT:  Despite the hardball tactics on both 
sides, the two countries eventually will need to reach 
agreement.  By attributing Turkmenistan's decision to U.S. 
pressure, even if only in a passing comment, Iran may be 
trying to use whatever leverage it has, including implying 
Turkmenistan's actions are inconsistent with its neutral 
status.  The negotiation's decibel level could continue to 
rise before the two sides find common ground.  END COMMENT.
