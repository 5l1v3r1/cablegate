¶1. (SBU) Summary. During his January 7 visit to the 
Governorate of Nabeul, the Ambassador highlighted USG 
financial and public support for Tunisian government and 
civil society efforts to promote the integration of 
handicapped youth through local educational initiatives.  The 
Ambassador visited two vocational training centers for 
handicapped youth that were constructed with funding from the 
US Department of Defense Humanitarian Assistance (HA) 
Program.  The Ambassador also met with the Governor of Nabeul 
to express USG appreciation for his support for the HA 
program and discuss regional priorities, including 
development of the agricultural and tourism sectors and 
attracting US investment.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On January 7, the Ambassador visited the Governorate 
of Nabeul and met with Governor Mohamed Lamine El Abed.  The 
Governor noted that Nabeul, Tunisia's third largest 
governorate, has strong agriculture, handicrafts, industrial 
and tourism sectors.  El Abed told the Ambassador that he 
hopes to attract more US investment, particularly in Nabeul's 
burgeoning ecotourism industry.  The Ambassador said he is 
working to increase US business interest in Tunisia, which 
has made impressive economic and social progress.  He also 
expressed USG thanks for the Governor's support for the two 
HA-funded projects in Nabeul, which the Governor 
characterized as examples of civil society development.  El 
Abed added that he fondly remembered the days of Peace Corps 
in Tunisia and said that English education is a strategic 
choice. 
 
¶3. (U) The Ambassador also visited the two vocational 
training centers in Nabeul and Menzil Temime that were 
constructed with funding from the DOD Humanitarian Assistance 
Program.  The Embassy provided $550,000 to the Association 
for the Parents and Friends of the Handicapped (APAHT) to 
construct the two educational and training facilities that 
promote a better quality of life for youth with special needs 
and their families.  The Ambassador had the opportunity to 
speak with tens of students at the centers, as well as learn 
more about the programs from APAHT volunteers and 
professional educators.  He recognized the centers as symbols 
of education and opportunity -- common values shared by 
Tunisia and the United States.  The Ambassador also expressed 
his support for the two projects and highlighted the efforts 
put forth by the Tunisian authorities, community participants 
and APAHT members for their support for and coordination of 
the projects.  (Note: Since 1999, the HA Program has provided 
almost $5 million in funding for eight projects in Tunisia. 
End Note.)
