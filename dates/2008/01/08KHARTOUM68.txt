SUBJECT: AMIS "LIQUIDATION TEAMS" TO REDISTRIBUTE UNAMID ASSETS 
 
¶1.  (SBU) This is an action request.  Please see paragraph ten. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Summary. The African Union (AU) plans to form Liquidation 
Teams to inventory and redistribute equipment, possibly including 
USG assets already transferred to UNAMID.  Until the inventory, AMIS 
refuses to permit UNAMID personnel access to the equipment. UNAMID 
has requested USG and donor intervention to prevent diversion of 
these badly-needed assets. End Summary. 
 
AU LIQUIDATION TEAMS FORMED 
--------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) The African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) has issued 
instructions on the "Liquidation of AMIS Human Resources and 
Assets," which could possibly undermine donor and USG materiel 
support for the UN-African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID). 
 
¶4. (SBU) To conduct this liquidation, Joint Special Representative 
(JSR) Senior Advisor and transitioning African Union Mission in 
Sudan (AMIS) Chief Political Officer Abdul Rahman Ibrahim Ahmed told 
emboffs on January 14 that the Khartoum African Union (AU) office 
has established a team of 100 former AMIS officers, including UN 
appointees, headed by former AMIS Deputy Head of Mission Ambassador 
Hassan Gibril and former AMIS Joint Chief of Staff Brigadier General 
Musonda, to conduct an inventory of AMIS equipment. 
 
¶5. (SBU) AU Liquidation Team Chief told FieldOff in El-Fasher on 
January 16 that "liquidation" was part of every peacekeeping 
operation and that this action was overdue. He said that most, if 
not all, of the AMIS equipment belongs to the AU and the AU would 
decide which assets would go to the UN, which would go to other 
operations "such as Somalia," and which would go to "local 
populations." 
 
AU REFUSES EQUIPMENT TO UNAMID 
------------------------------ 
 
¶6. (SBU) UN Chief of Integrated Support Services (CISS) Ian Divers 
expressed to emboffs January 15 his view that the AU's "sense of 
entitlement is out of hand," citing AMIS' refusal on January 12 to 
permit entry to a UNAMID Joint Logistics warehouse to the Deputy 
CISS.  He said that AMIS has refused to release badly-needed 
ground-to-air radios and vehicles to UNAMID.  Divers added that 
there is no recognition that most if not all of the equipment was 
USG-owned and now belongs to UNAMID. 
 
AU TOLD THAT USG ALREADY TRANSFERRED ASSETS TO UNAMID 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶7. (SBU) Emboffs provided Joint Special Representative (JSR) 
Political Advisor Abdul Rahman Ibrahim Ahmed on January 14 a copy of 
the USG Technical Manager's (USGTM) one-page statement that was 
posted at AMIS camps in advance of Turnover of Authority (TOA). 
This statement alerted all AMIS personnel on the mechanics of the 
transition and transfer of assets to UNAMID. Emboffs explained that 
the USG inventoried all equipment prior to TOA and that all USG 
assets used by AMIS are now UNAMID property. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Abdul Rahman confirmed he knew USG assets should be turned 
over to UNAMID, but said that there was a great deal of equipment 
that the AU had donated as well.  However, Abdul Rahman appeared to 
confuse USG, UK, Canadian and other bilateral support given to 
individual Troop Contributing Countries (TCCs) with donor 
contributions made to the AU. 
 
UN SEEKS HELP 
-------------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) UN CISS Director Divers expressed dissatisfaction with the 
situation, saying that UN New York headquarters seemed "amused" by 
the liquidation problem.  He added that the prolonged absence of UN 
Director of Administration Mohammed Yunis makes the situation worse 
as only Yunis has the financial and personnel decision-making 
authority to deal with the problem.  Divers urged USG assistance 
saying that 
donors need to protect their investments in the peacekeeping 
operation and control the AU.  He said that the UN Department of 
Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) Assistant-Secretary-General for 
Mission Support Jane Holl Lute's January 19 visit would be a good 
time to raise the issue and, he hoped, would be before Joint Special 
Representative Rudolphe Adada formally authorized the AU Liquidation 
Teams. 
 
¶10. (SBU) Action request: Embassy plans to relay our concerns to 
AU/UNAMID officials such as Special Representative Monique 
Mukaruliza and others on the AU's liquidation plans. We suggest that 
other missions do the same prior to Holl Lute's upcoming Darfur 
 
KHARTOUM 00000068  002 OF 002 
 
 
trip, which will soon be followed by a DPKO Under-Secretary-General 
Jean-Marie Guhenno Darfur visit.  While it is unlikely to change 
the Liquidation Team's mandate at this stage without risking some 
loss of AMIS prestige, we believe it would make sense nonetheless to 
weigh in with the AU in Addis Ababa to try to modify the parameters 
for distribution of AMIS assets in order to control the potential 
loss of UNAMID equipment and materiel. This is the latest of a 
series of self-inflicted wounds carried out by the international 
force in Darfur "against itself" leading to an already weakened and 
divided force.
