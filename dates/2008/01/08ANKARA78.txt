REF: ANKARA 02962 
 
¶1. Summary:  The EXBS Program Manager for Turkey met with 
post and Turkish officials to review the state of the 
program.  EXBS  Advisor completed transfer of the 
Z-Backscatter Van (ZBV) to Turkish Customs.  Turkish Atomic 
Energy Agency (TAEK) has requested a joint proliferation 
"threat" assessment. Progress continues for ongoing 
enforcement training and equipment deliveries. 
 
¶2. Completed Actions for the Reporting Period 
 
¶A. Meetings During Recent Reporting Period 
 
1)  Brett Golden, EXBS Program Manager for Turkey, held the 
following meetings during his December 7-8 visit to Ankara: 
 
a) Turkish Atomic Energy Agency (TAEK) Director Okay 
Cakiroglu. Cakiroglu continues to promote indigenous 
development and deployment of radiation detection equipment, 
to include portal monitors at key border crossings, hand-held 
detectors, and personal pagers for Customs Enforcement 
Officers.  He asserted the new Turkish portal monitors would 
provide a more secure system for Turkey and reduce the risk 
of "backdoor" access by "other" entities.  TAEK already has 
built over 100 portal monitors to date.  He proposed a joint 
US/Turkish threat assessment to identify specific 
nonproliferation risks for Turkey (reftel), and based on the 
assessment, to work cooperatively with the U.S. to develop a 
suitable radiation detection equipment program for 
implementation in Turkey.  We believe it will be difficult to 
obtain TAEK buy-in for future EXBS and SLD initiatives 
without conducting such an assessment. Request update from 
Washington on progress toward convening a threat assessment 
team to travel to Ankara within the next few months. 
 
On Commodity Identification Training (CIT), Okay noted that 
TAEK, Foreign Trade, and Customs have delivered training for 
the US/Turkish developed CIT software program to over 50 
Customs officials since its inception last year.  There are 
plans to train an additional 400 officials in the coming 
year. TAEK also indicated that they have begun integration of 
WMD related content into their CIT curriculum. 
 
b) Undersecretariat for Foreign Trade (UFT) Department Head 
for Foreign Agreements Atilla Bastimaci.  Atilla noted that 
UFT is working closely with Turkish Parliament to harmonize 
Turkey's export control laws with EU legislation.  As a 
result, Atilla said it would be difficult for UFT to co-host 
the Transshipment Forum this year.  Atilla suggested UFT 
would be better positioned to co-host this conference in 2009 
or 2010.  We agreed EXBS would consider Turkey as a potential 
co-host in the future. 
 
c) Turkish National Police (TNP) Organized Crime and 
Smuggling Section Head Mehmet Keskinkilic.  Keskinkilic 
expressed appreciation for the assistance and training that 
EXBS has provided to his officers through U.S. Customs and 
Border Security training programs.  He noted his officers 
have incorporated this training into training programs in 
Turkey.  His biggest concern now is to obtain enforcement 
equipment and training that would assist his officers in 
performing searches for WMD related items. Keskinkilic 
expressed interest in the possibility of some of his officers 
attending the October 2008 Controlled Delivery training 
course offered by US/DHS Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
officers. 
 
d) Acting Director General for Customs Enforcement Hayrettin 
Cevher.  We discussed past and current EXBS/Customs 
cooperation and signed the property grant documents for the 
formal turnover of the AS&E Z-Backscatter van to Turkish 
Customs. They plan a more public announcement of this new van 
and U.S. assistance following future successful seizures by 
Customs. 
 
e) MFA Head of Department for Nonproliferation and 
Disarmament Elif Ulgen.  We reviewed with Ulgen Golden's 
 
 
meetings with other GOT agencies and requested an update on 
the status of the EXBS agreement. Elif noted that while MFA 
welcomed news that the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy (PUNE 
or 123) Agreement is now at the White House, the acceptance 
note for the EXBS Agreement would most likely be issued 
simultaneously or immediately following U.S. ratification of 
the PUNE Agreement. 
 
f) EXBS Advisor took intermit leave locally from 17 - 28 Dec, 
¶2007. 
 
¶B. Training Conducted During this Reporting Period: - None. 
 
¶C. Equipment Delivered During this Reporting Period: - One 
Z-Backscatter van was formally transferred to Turkish Customs 
Enforcement on December 7th, 2007. Customs Enforcement has 
obtained the required Turkish licenses and picked up the van 
on January 11th, 2008. 
 
¶D. Imminent Training or Equipment Status Update: 
 
1) 8 ea- CT-30 Kits and 200 ea- Gerber tool kits 
w/flashlights are at Ankara Airport in bonded storage at a 
special warehouse for radioactive materials and MFA has 
informed us that they have obtain all required licenses for 
Customs clearance.  Anticipate delivery to Customs 
Enforcement in 1-2 weeks.  As noted in last month's report, 
Los Alamos Technical Associates (LATA) will need to provide 
funding for storage fees upon the equipment's release from 
the bonded warehouse. Expected storage cost will be 
approximately $25 per day for all materials in storage, or 
approximately $1,125 in total. 
 
2) In cooperation with EXBS, DOE/SLD has scheduled 6- two day 
hand-held radiation detection training sessions for up to 48 
Turkish National Police officers at the TNP,s Golbasi 
Training facility for February 1 - 18, 2008. This will be 
conducted by three DOE Pacific Northwest Laboratory 
instructors. 
 
¶E. Significant Developments in Export Controls, 
Nonproliferation, or Related Border Security: The 
Undersecretariat for Foreign Trade continues to work with 
Parliament to harmonize current export control Laws with EU 
Export Control Laws. UFT expects these new laws to be enacted 
later in 2008. 
 
¶3. Future Activities: EXBS Advisor requested MFA approval to 
visit several southern ports of entry in mid-to- late January 
¶2008.  Advisor also made a request to attend the 
commissioning ceremony in the port of Izmir for a new x-ray 
unit which was donated by the EU to Turkish Customs 
Enforcement. 
 
¶4. Red Flag Issues:  None.
