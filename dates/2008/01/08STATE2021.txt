SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSE 05-050077022 
 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request. See paragraphs 2 - 4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a pre-license check on license 05-050077022 for the export of 
ammunition components to Russia. Post is requested to 
complete this Blue Lantern check within 30 days. Lack of 
response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and 
future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for Request: Applicant has submitted this 
application on two previous occasions, each being returned 
without action. The first application (050053908) did not 
sufficiently explain the provided end-use and the second 
(050055208) was submitted with a new end-use that was not 
supported by the documentation provided. The current 
submission claims commercial re-sale as the end-use. 
Considering the caliber and quantity of the ammunition 
components as well as the previous submissions for these 
items, the bona fides of this transaction and end-user should 
be established. 
 
¶4. Action Request: Post is requested to establish the bona 
fides of Barnaul Cartridge Plant as a reliable recipient of 
United States Munitions List (USML) articles. Post should 
also determine the client-base of Barnaul Cartridge Plant to 
whom the manufactured ammunition may be sold. The following 
points are provided for guidance: 
 
(To Barnaul Cartridge Plant)-- How long has your company been 
in the business of importing and selling defense articles? 
Are you familiar with the restrictions governing the import 
of U.S. Munitions List (USML) commodities, in particular, the 
prohibition of unauthorized re-export? Who are your regular 
customers and where do they reside? Can you elaborate on the 
specific end-use of these items? Does your company have any 
purchase orders from any potential buyers for these items? 
What use does your company have with such a high quantity of 
ammunition components? 
 
¶5. Details of license application:

QUANTITY/COMMODITY: 
 
10,103,000 Components for Ammunition (cal .224 - .355)
