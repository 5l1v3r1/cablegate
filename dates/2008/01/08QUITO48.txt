¶1.  (SBU) On January 16, PolChief and MilGroup Commander 
delivered proposed text of diplomatic note and talking points 
from Reftel in a meeting with MFA Under Secretary of 
Sovereignty Affairs Jaime Barberis, MFA Legal Advisor Gonzalo 
Salvador, and MOD Chief of Ministerial Cabinet COL Galo Cruz. 
 The initial Ecuadorian response was positive.  The GOE is 
reviewing the text further, and promised to give us a quick 
response.  COL Cruz stated that he would like to see the 
process completed before the Defense Minister's trip to the 
United States on January 23. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On January 17, Embassy Quito updated the text of 
the proposed diplomatic note per the January 17 e-mail from 
WHA/AND Janine Keil, to reinsert an inadvertently omitted 
sentence in Article XIII.  Text of Article XIII now reads as 
follows: "Vehicles, vessels, and aircraft operated by the 
United States armed forces shall not be subject to the 
payment of landing or port fees, pilotage, navigation or over 
flight charges, or tolls or other use charges, including 
light and harbor dues, while in Ecuador.  Aircraft operated 
by or for the United States armed forces shall observe local 
air traffic control regulations while in Ecuador.  Vessels 
owned or operated by the United States armed forces shall not 
be subject to compulsory pilotage at Ecuadorian ports."
