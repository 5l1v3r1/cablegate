SUBJECT: SENEGAL-PRESIDENT OF NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEFIES 
PRESIDENT WADE 
 
REF: Dakar 2287 
 
SUMMARY 
-------- 
¶1.  (SBU) Pressed on December 28 by President Wade to 
resign from his position as Chairman of the National 
Assembly, Macky Sall, one of Wade's former Prime 
Ministers, refused to do so indicating that he had 
"done no wrong."  This is an unprecedented riposte 
for the ruling PDS (Democratic Party of Senegal) 
where Wade?s authority is seldom challenged.  The 
crisis between the President and the Chairman of the 
National Assembly is now reaching a climax and 
heralds more political turbulence ahead.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
NO LEGAL EXIT 
------------- 
¶2. (SBU) Generally, when Wade faces opposition from a 
member of his party he does not hesitate to use 
extreme measures such as dissolving institutions to 
rid himself of dissenters.  In the case of Macky Sall 
however, the Senegalese Constitution prevents Wade 
from dissolving the National Assembly before June 
2009 (i.e. two years after the Assembly's election). 
Although legislation to reduce the term of office of 
a National Assembly Chair from five to one year is in 
the pipeline, Sall could constitutionally still lead 
the Assembly for at least another six months.  Doudou 
Wade, the leader of the majority and Wade's nephew 
commented: "this is too long, he must resign to 
respect the will of the President or we will no 
longer respect his authority." 
 
DIGGING THE TRENCHES 
-------------------- 
¶3.  (SBU) President Wade has instructed Doudou Wade 
to orchestrate a campaign to force Sall to resign. 
It is reported that he has obtained signatures from 
107 of the 150 Members of Parliament for a motion to 
that effect.  However, Sall has made it clear that 
these signatures calling for his resignation are not 
legally binding and he will not resign as a matter of 
principle.  A staff member of the Assembly told 
Embassy that the government has already started to 
tighten the Assembly's financial spigot and this may 
be part of a strategy to weaken Sall's leadership. 
Meanwhile, Sall has initiated a counter offensive by 
organizing a group of Deputies led by Aliou Dia who 
are calling for the independence of the legislative 
branch.  Dia indicated that he has support from one 
third of the Assembly and will conduct "a media 
campaign."  Sall has also activated his ethnic 
political base in the River valley area (north of 
Senegal) and some religious leaders from that area 
are already underlining Sall's significant 
contributions to Wade's reelection last February and 
thus that he deserves to Chair the Assembly. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
¶4.  (SBU) Wade's battle with the Chair of the 
National Assembly is just another chapter in the 
post-Wade succession battle.  Macky Sall, who 
believes that he is a legitimate contender after 
serving both as Prime Minister and leading Wade?s 
Party to legislative victory, is not ready to stay on 
the sidelines and let Wade's son Karim assume the 
mantel of the party's future nominee.  Both Wade and 
Sall are determined to avoid defeat in this 
confrontation.  Though this is a purely political 
battle within the PDS, it has lead to a much needed 
public debate about the importance of independence 
for the legislative branch and the impact of 
executive interference.
