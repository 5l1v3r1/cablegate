¶1.  (U) This cable responds to a request for information on 
MINURSO's efforts to combat trafficking in persons (TIP) and sexual 
exploitation and abuse (SEA) involving UN peacekeeping mission 
personnel in the Western Sahara and Moroccan peacekeepers in Cote 
d'Ivoire.  This message was cleared with Embassy Rabat and 
represents coordinated Mission views. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) According to the Government of Morocco (GOM), TIP and SEA 
are not a problem with the MINURSO mission in the Western Sahara. 
In discussions with officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
(MFA), Poloff was informed that MINURSO personnel have cooperated 
fully with the GOM in efforts to deal with illegal migrants and 
trafficked persons found in the Western Sahara.  Furthermore, the 
GOM is satisfied with MINURSO's efforts to control SEA and TIP in 
the region. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) MINURSO Civil Affairs Officer, Claire Bamber, reported 
that in 2007 there was one case of misconduct involving a Pakistani 
peacekeeper and a local civilian.  The case was reported and 
thoroughly investigated.  MINURSO ordered the Pakistani officer be 
sent home as a result of the investigation.  The incident has been 
fully reported to the UN and the Security Council. 
 
¶4.  (U) In July of 2007 Moroccan peacekeepers in Cote d'Ivoire were 
accused of sexual abuse involving underage girls.  The GOM fully 
supported UN efforts to investigate the accusations.  An inquiry 
team, consisting of UN investigators and Moroccan army officers, was 
unable to unearth any conclusive evidence of abuse.  No formal 
charges have been filed. 
 
¶5.  (U) MINURSO's Head of Mission and Special Representative of the 
Secretary General for the Western Sahara, Julian Harston, strongly 
 
SIPDIS 
endorses the UN's zero-tolerance policy regarding sexual 
exploitation and abuse.  To further enhance the mission's already 
strict policies, MINURSO welcomed, in February 2007, its first 
Conduct and Discipline Officer.  The officer will further develop a 
mandatory training program regarding sexual abuse and exploitation. 
 
 
¶6.  (U) Mission was unable to locate any reports, other than the one 
listed about by MINURSO, of SEA or TIP- involving MINURSO personnel. 
We believe that the general public perceives no problem of this 
nature with MINURSO.
