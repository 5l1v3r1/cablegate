¶1.  (SBU) Summary: The Gaza Power Plant received 750,000 
liters of industrial fuel on January 22 and restarted 
electricity production following two days of shut-down.  Gaza 
gas station owners refused to make deliveries within Gaza of 
a 250,000-liter diesel fuel shipment at the Nahal Oz fuel 
transfer station on January 22, complaining that the 
shipments were "for the exclusive use of UNRWA and PA 
hospitals - not the Gaza public."  An estimated 27 truckloads 
of humanitarian shipments passed through Kerem Shalom 
crossing on January 22.  The Coastal Municipalities Water 
Authority estimated that during the shut-down of the Gaza 
Power Plant, roughly 40 percent of Gazans were without 
running water in their homes.  End summary. 
 
Gaza Power Plant Receives Two Days Fuel Supply 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Gaza Power Plant Manager Rafiq Maliha told Econoff 
on January 22 that the plant is in the process of receiving a 
750,000-liter shipment of industrial fuel from the Nahal Oz 
fuel transport station - enough for the plant to produce 65 
MW of electricity for two days.  Maliha said that the plant, 
which produces roughly 30 percent of Gaza's electricity 
supply, re-started its turbines in the morning hours of 
January 22, following two days of shut-down due to a lack of 
fuel.  Maliah said that he did not know when the next fuel 
delivery would take place, as the Israeli press has claimed 
the January 22 fuel shipments to be a "one time" exception. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Maliha said that the 120 MW of electricity from the 
Israel Electricity Company (IEC) and the 18 MW from Egypt 
continued to supply most of the southern, central, and the 
most northern Gaza Strip with power when the Plant was shut 
down.  He said that the shut down of the Plant hit hardest 
those residents of Gaza City and some in central Gaza. 
Maliha stressed that the ad hoc configuration of Gaza's grid 
makes it difficult to transfer and monitor electricity flows 
through the exchange points between the IEC and the Power 
Plant. 
 
Gaza Gas Station Owners Declare Work Stoppage 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Vice Chairman of the Gaza Petroleum and Gas Station 
Owners' Association Mahmound Khozendar told Econoff that 
250,000 liters of diesel fuel were transferred at Nahal Oz on 
January 22, but that his association's members refused to 
deliver the fuel, as the entire amount was to be shipped to 
UNRWA and PA hospitals for their exclusive use - none for the 
gas stations.  "We will not participate in this sort of 
abuse," said Khozendar.  He stressed that once diesel fuel is 
"available to all Gazans" his association's members will 
re-start fuel deliveries.  The 250,000 liters of diesel fuel 
remains in holding tanks on the Gaza side of the Nahal Oz 
transfer station.  Khozendar added that the industrial fuel 
deliveries to the Power Plant will continue to be an 
exception to the work stoppage.  He noted that 240 tons of 
cooking gas was received at Nahal Oz on January 22 and 
delivered through a separate distribution system. 
 
Some Humanitarian Shipments Go Through 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) WFP Deputy Country Director Jacques Higgins said 
that WFP shipped seven truckloads of food aid into Gaza 
through the Kerem Shalom crossing on January 22.  Higgins 
said that UNRWA, ICRC, and WHO had also shipped on that day 
an estimated 20 truckloads of humanitarian goods through 
Kerem Shalom.  WFP planned to ship 15 trucks of aid through 
Kerem Shalom on January 23, said Higgins. 
 
Lack of Electricity Cripples Hospital Operations 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) WHO Country Director Mahmoud Daher told Econoff on 
January 22 that Dar al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City has, once 
again, limited its health services to emergency cases only, 
as the hospital's three generators have only three or four 
days of diesel fuel supply remaining - roughly 9500 liters. 
Daher estimated that Gaza hospital activity has slowed by 50 
 
JERUSALEM 00000111  002 OF 002 
 
 
percent in the last two days due to the lack of electricity. 
Despite the Power Plant's renewed power production on January 
22, Gaza hospital managers had told him that they will 
continue to limit health services offered for the foreseeable 
future to preserve fuel stocks, as the fuel import situation 
remains unpredictable. 
 
Limited Running Water Throughout Gaza 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) PA Coastal Municipalities Water Utility (CMWU) 
engineer in Gaza Monther Shoblak told Econoff on January 22 
that during the January 20-22 Power Plant shut-down, an 
estimated 40 percent of Gaza homes were without running 
water.  He said that some 60 percent of the 137 CMWU-operated 
water wells in Gaza have been turned-off to conserve limited 
diesel fuel supplies.  Shoblak said that all Gaza power and 
water utilities continue to rotate electricity and water 
services to the extent possible between Gaza neighborhoods, 
most of which received two hours of running water and four to 
eight hours of electricity during the Power Plant shut-down.
