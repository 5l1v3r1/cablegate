REF: ANKARA 354 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1.  The Turkish Ministry of Agriculture reported on January 22 that 
avian influenza was found in dead backyard poultry in the town of 
Caycuma, in the northern province of Zonguldak.  Following the 
RT-PCR method testing at the Central Veterinary Control and Research 
Institute, it was determined that the birds had been infected with 
the H5N1 strain Avian Influenza virus. 
 
¶2. A farmer from Sazkoy village in Caycuma, Mr. Serafettin Yilmaz, 
informed the Ministry that six of his chickens were found dead on 
January 18 and 19 and two were found sick. Precautionary measures 
and tests began immediately. 
 
¶3. The area where the dead birds were found is very close to Filyos 
Stream, where migratory birds are seen. There are about 300 poultry 
at risk in Sazkoy village and up to 1,500 including the surrounding 
villages. As a result of this incident, the Ministry of Agriculture 
established six Culling Teams and six Disinfection Teams. Ministry 
of Health officials were informed of the developments and they have 
taken necessary precautions. 
 
¶4. Sensitive: A source from the Ministry informed FAS that there is 
a commercial poultry operation QnearbyQ but officials do not plan on 
culling at that facility at this time. 
 
 
¶5. No other AI cases have been observed in Turkey since February 
¶2007.
