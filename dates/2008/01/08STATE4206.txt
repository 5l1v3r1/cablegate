SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶2.  (U)  On 18 December, Pakistan notified the UNSCR 1737 
Sanctions Committee of its intention to authorize-under 
paragraph 15 of UNSCR 1737-payments due under contracts with 
Bank Sepah entered into prior to the listing of Bank Sepah in 
Annex I of UNSCR 1747.  Washington would like to request that 
Pakistan provide more information to the Committee and the 
U.S. regarding these payments and the underlying contracts in 
order to confirm that the authorization of such payments is 
fully consistent with the terms of paragraph 15 of UNSCR 1737. 
 
¶3.  (U)  In accordance with paragraph 15 of UNSCR 1737 and 
paragraph 4 of 1747, Pakistan may authorize these payments as 
early as January 18.  We wish to immediately convey our 
request to the GOP, prior to the payment of any funds, and 
ask the GOP to delay authorization or withdraw its 
notification until more information is provided on the origin 
of money used to process these payments.
