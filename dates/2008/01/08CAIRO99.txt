SUBJECT: FOLLOW-UP MEDIA COVERAGE OF PRESIDENT BUSH'S VISIT 
 
REF: CAIRO 0065 
 
¶1. (SBU) Following a week of negative media coverage, from 
government, opposition and independent newspapers alike, in 
the lead up to President Bush's January 16 visit to Egypt, 
all Egyptian TV channels - government and satellite - 
carried the joint POTUS-Mubarak press conference live and 
provided straightforward coverage as the lead prime time 
news story on January 16.  Television talk shows that 
evening featured extensive discussion of the visit with 
political analysts but also replayed images from Israeli 
attacks in Gaza on January 16. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Pro-government print media coverage highlighted 
President Bush's praise of Egypt's political reform, 
economic openness, and positive role of women, as well as 
President Mubarak's statement that the Palestinian issue is 
the key to regional peace and stability.  Negative 
headlines appeared in the independent and sensationalist 
press.  Leading independent daily Al Masry Al Yom described 
the summit as "cold," and highlighted public protests 
against the visit in Cairo and other Egyptian governorates. 
Protesters accused the Egyptian regime of "complacency 
with U.S and Zionist policy, aimed at shedding the blood of 
Arabs." 
 
¶3. (SBU) On January 20, Al-Ahram carried an interview of 
the Ambassador with Salama Ahmed Salama which highlighted 
the success of the visit and the agreement between 
President Bush and President Mubarak to "manage 
disagreements."  The same pro-government newspaper on 
January 18 carried a piece by Osama Saraya who argued that 
President Bush's visit underscored Egypt's continuing 
importance in regional affairs. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Commentaries in all papers ranged from a neutral 
discussion of the bilateral relationship to a broad 
criticism of U.S. policy in the region, such as by 
editorialist Mohamed Abul Hadid in Al Gomhouriya: "Bush 
wants Arab support in continuing to occupy Iraq, attacking 
Iran, pressuring Palestinians, helping the American 
treasury by buying its weapons, and adopting the American 
life of democracy, etc.  However, when we make a single 
request for the U.S. to pressure Israel to evacuate from 
Palestinian territories, he says he cannot. In fact, he 
would not."
