SUBJECT: POLAND READIES AIR MARSHALL AGREEMENT WITH U.S. 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  William Gaches, Assistant Administrator of the 
Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and Paul 
Rodgers, TSA Representative in Brussels, visited Warsaw 
December 6-7.  While in Warsaw, Gaches and Rodgers met with 
officials from Poland's Civil Aviation Office to discuss a 
proposed bilateral air marshal agreement.  The agreement 
would set out rights and responsibilities of both U.S. 
federal air marshals on board U.S. carrier flights to Poland 
and of Polish sky marshals on board Polish carrier flights to 
the U.S. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Polish aviation officials who met with Gaches and 
Rodgers expressed strong support for the draft agreement that 
Gaches presented.  However, they requested further 
negotiations on a provision in the agreement that stipulates 
when U.S. law would apply on a U.S. aircraft departing from 
Poland.  Under the terms of the draft agreement, U.S. law 
applies when the doors of the aircraft are closed.  The 
Polish officials felt that Polish law should continue in 
force until the aircraft leaves the ground.  Both the U.S. 
and Polish officials were optimistic that the issue could be 
resolved. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Gaches said Kip Hawley, TSA Administrator, or one 
of senior assistants, would come to Poland to sign the 
bilateral agreement.  Gaches added that no date had been set 
for signing the agreement, but estimated that it would occur 
in April or May 2008. 
 
¶4.  (U)  This cable was cleared by Gaches and Rodgers.
