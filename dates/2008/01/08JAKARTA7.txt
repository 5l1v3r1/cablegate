COOPERATION 
 
 ¶1. (U) SUMMARY: On November 26 - 27, Jakarta hosted the New 
Asian-African Strategic Partnership (NAASP) Workshop on 
Satellite Technology and Its Applications.  Experts, 
representatives and observers from eleven nations attended 
the conference to discuss potential areas of cooperation. The 
conference produced three-pages of recommendations for NAASP 
member states, including discussion of a roadmap to support 
the launch of an Afro-Asian satellite by 2017.  END SUMMARY. 
 
Why Satellites?  NAASP Background and Satellite Interest 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
¶2. (U) The NAASP was established during the Asia-Africa 
Summit in Jakarta in April, 2005 to focus on three broad 
areas of regional partnership: political solidarity, economic 
cooperation, and cultural relations with an overall emphasis 
on practical cooperation. The NAASP includes 89 countries 
from across the two continents.   During the Durban 
Conference in September, 2006, members identified cooperation 
in satellite communication as a primary initiative. 
 
¶3. (U) Muhammad Nuh, Indonesia's Minister of Communication 
and Information Technology opened the conference, emphasizing 
satellite cooperation is one of the most important 
implementations of the New Asian-African Strategic 
Partnership.  Minister Nuh explained that Indonesia was the 
first developing country to acquire its own domestic 
satellite system (PALAPA in 1976) noting, "We had a strong 
belief that the satellite system is just the right 
communication technology to unite our archipelagic country 
consisting of more than 17,000 islands and where no 
terrestrial means could ever reach in a relatively short time 
and be affordable to our country." 
 
¶4. (U) Developing satellite technology is a priority for 
NAASP countries for the following reasons: 
-- Presents new opportunities for economic and social 
development. 
-- Promotes education by making distance-learning feasible. 
-- Provides advances in science and medicine by allowing 
greater cooperation through telecommunications. 
-- Enhances the capabilities of governments to deliver social 
services. 
-- Establishes decision support systems for disaster 
management, agriculture, security,and environmental 
monitoring. 
-- Presents turnkey solutions for communications in areas 
that are remote or lack the necessary infrastructure. 
 
Sky of Diamonds, but Asia Can Do More 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Conference attendees discussed both individual and 
bilateral achievements but only briefly focused on broader, 
multi-lateral perspectives. Indonesian National Institute of 
Aeronautics and Space Chairman Adi Sadewo stated that member 
states should share both benefits and costs of these 
programs. South African Director of Space Application and 
Satellite Communication Elliot Sibeko emphasized that the 
satellite market was a lucrative industry, stating that South 
Africa was already paying millions to foreign companies to 
provide telecommunications services and that a country could 
potentially profit from developing its own system. 
 
¶6. (U) Dr. Sayed Mostafa Safavi Homami of the Iran Space 
Agency called for more regional participation from Asia when 
he noted, "This program should be done on a broader scale. 
Africa has demonstrated its willingness, but Asia should do 
more."  He explained that the wealthier Asian countries 
should be willing to provide resources and expertise for the 
region as a whole. 
 
¶7. (U) The conference produced a three-page document of 
recommendations for NAASP member states.  Recommendations 
included forming networks of expertise or "centers of 
excellence" where advanced countries would share expertise 
with other developing nations.  Delegates agreed to set up a 
joint task force in order to formulate "a roadmap" to support 
the launch of an Afro-Asian Satellite by 2017. 
 
The Cart Before the Horse? 
-------------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) COMMENT: Delegates spent two days discussing 
satellite technology, but didn't come up with many concrete 
recommendations.  Although each delegation seemed keenly 
aware of how satellite technology benefits its own country, 
 
JAKARTA 00000007  002 OF 002 
 
 
overall, the conference presented few cogent points regarding 
the benefits of satellite cooperation across the region. 
Delegates did not discuss reverse-engineering currently 
orbiting satellites for these programs nor did they discuss 
the need to develop a common launch system in order to place 
several satellites or an entire constellation in orbit.  In 
short, the question must be asked, "How will they get them up 
there?"  The conference was an important first step towards 
satellite cooperation, but failed to provide anything more 
substantial than stating broad, common goals.
