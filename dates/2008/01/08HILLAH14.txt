SUBJECT: NAJAF PRIVATE BANKERS DISCUSS REQUIREMENTS TO OPERATE BANKS 
 
¶1.  This is a PRT Najaf cable. 
 
¶2.  SUMMARY:  PRT Leader and PRToff met with individuals 
representing five private banks at FOB Endeavor on January 28, 
¶2008.  The purpose of this initial meeting was to introduce 
PRToff and to discuss topics concerning local private bankers. 
Issues discussed included: combating security fears; operating 
with inconsistent electricity; lacking sufficient fuel for 
generators; improving Iraqi banking system; training employees; 
acquiring new equipment; and operating Automatic Teller Machines 
(ATM).  END SUMMARY 
 
¶3.  PRToff (Banking and Financial Advisor Darrell Brown) 
introduced himself by saying he was here to initiate a dialogue 
about their concerns and how to address them as a team. 
Discussion centered on the most important obstacles impeding 
efforts to operate banks safely and efficiently.  Their primary 
concerns are addressed below. 
 
¶4.  Several of the bankers stated they had no security 
protection.  The IA and IP guard the state banks but are not 
available for the private banks.  Consequently, their ability to 
transport and store cash is severely impaired.  They are also 
concerned they will be kidnapped or robbed.  Note:  After the 
meeting, it was reported Governor Al'Tae promised to authorize 
banking staff to carry personal weapons. 
 
¶5.  Another concern expressed was that electricity was available 
for three hours a day on average.  When asked about generators, 
they all replied they have them, but fuel is too expensive. 
Note: After the meeting, it was reported Governor Al'Tae 
promised to provide them with more electricity and fuel. 
 
¶6.  Several of the bankers complained the banking system is slow 
or non-responsive, because it is centrally run out of Baghdad. 
For example, one banker said it takes months to get approval to 
make a loan.  This angers local customers and drives them to 
other means of financing.  PRToff said he is aware of this 
problem and that efforts are underway locally and at the 
national level to improve this, but the solutions depend upon 
the political will to change and that this will take time. 
 
¶7.  Modernizing equipment and training employees was also 
discussed.  Many banks are keeping records manually, or on 
outdated computers.  In addition, many employees are unfamiliar 
with modern banking.  PRToff said much of this issue can be 
addressed by training officers and employees in Iraq and 
possibly outside Iraq.  He suggested one option could be 
developing training courses in conjunction with Kufa University. 
 
 
¶8.  One bright spot came when Director Hamid Abbas of Warka Bank 
spoke.  He said his bank has an ATM, just recently implemented a 
Visa debit card program and can do international wire transfers 
via Western Union.  PRToff Brown asked how many merchants in 
Najaf accept debit cards.  Director Abbas replied only a few, 
but that efforts to bring more merchants into the system are 
underway.  Director Abbas expressed interest in working on 
placing ATMs in the Najaf Regional Airport, a top priority of 
Governor Al'Tae. 
 
¶9.  PRToff concluded the meeting, saying the opportunities for 
improvement were many, and that PRT Najaf is committed to 
assisting the bankers in any way possible, but that the primary 
responsibility in making banking work lies with them.  They 
agreed.  The next meeting was discussed, with general agreement 
to meet in one of the local banks to discuss moving and storing 
cash safely and training employees.
