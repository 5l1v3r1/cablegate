¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Canadian International Trade Minister David 
Emerson's 24 hour visit to Mongolia, the first by a Canadian 
Minister in over 10 years, included meetings with President N. 
Enkhbayar, Prime Minister S. Bayar, Foreign Minister Oyun, and his 
counterpart at the Ministry of Industry and Trade Kh. Narankhuu. 
Minister Emerson also spoke at a business breakfast largely attended 
by Canadian mining firms active in Mongolia. At meetings with the 
GOM and business representatives, Emerson made clear that the 
Government of Canada (GOC) sought to discourage the Government of 
Mongolia's (GOM) apparent insistence on owning and perhaps even 
operating mines.  However, he also signaled that Canada would engage 
with Mongolia in the important mining sector, would support several 
initiatives to improve mining administration and would begin 
negotiations on a bilateral investment agreement with the GOM in 
March.  Emerson assured the business community that Canada intended 
to support their positions before the GOM and that the GOC would 
raise its profile in Mongolia.  A local Canadian businessman was 
made Canada's Honorary Consul, filling a position vacant these past 
18 months.  The Charge'and the British Ambassador respectively 
explained U.S. and British approaches to moving investment forward. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
President Enkhbayar Bangs The Old Time Socialist Drum 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) At the North American Mongolian Business Council's January 
10 breakfast with business and diplomatic representatives, Minister 
Emerson described the results of his meetings the previous day with 
GOM senior officials.  Emerson said he met with President Enkhbayar, 
whom he characterized as extremely well informed, articulate, and 
visionary.  After this brief encomium, Emerson expressed concern 
that Enkhbayar's approach to mining was too statist for Canadian 
tastes, saying that Enkhbayar was behind many of the efforts to 
re-nationalize Mongolia's natural resources, in spite of clear 
evidence that this was not the best development path.  Emerson 
recounted for Enkhbayar that Canada, much to its regret, had already 
tried nationalized resource businesses in mining and lumber, and 
that those efforts had largely failed to produce sustainable, 
efficient industries, forcing Canada to eventually privatize those 
industries in the end.  Canada's experience, and that of other 
nations, demonstrated that a sound legal and administrative 
framework could achieve the state's financial and social goals for 
its environment and people more effectively than outright government 
ownership and operation of assets. 
 
PM Bayar's Pragmatic Government More 
Encouraging Than Presidential Visions 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Emerson collectively praised PM Bayar, Foreign Minister S. 
Oyun, and MIT Minister Narankhuu for their pragmatic approach to 
 
ULAANBAATA 00000015  002 OF 004 
 
 
developing Mongolia's resources.  While the three senior GOM 
officials acknowledged the severe political pressures for 
nationalization impinging on Mongolia's development process, each of 
them also recognized and agreed with the GOC's view that the GOM 
needed foreign investment to bring its mines on line, and they 
agreed with GOC views that government ownership of assets was not 
the best way to develop them.  However, ministerial discussions 
revealed that the GOM simply lacked the statutory and regulatory 
apparatus needed to manage its resources effectively even as just a 
regulator, much less than as an owner. In response, Emerson stated 
that the GOC intended to provide technical assistance to help the 
GOM improve its regulatory framework.  (Comment:  Local analysts say 
it is this gulf between the GOM's fear that it won't get its fair 
share of Mongolia's mineral wealth and its inability to regulate the 
sector to that end that is, as much as anything, driving GOM 
attempts to nationalize assets, based on a belief that if the GOM 
owns a piece of the pie outright, then it will at least get 
something from natural resource extraction. Given that at least 30% 
of the GOM's budget is underwritten by the state-owned Erdenet 
copper mine, Mongolia's insistence on state participation is 
explainable. End Comment.) 
 
¶4. (SBU) Emerson also formally announced that the GOC would enter 
into negotiations with the GOM on an investment agreement, the 
"Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement," the aim of 
which is to boost Canada's trade ties with Mongolia. Canada is 
Mongolia's second-largest investor, with about US$397 million worth 
of assets in the country, and the prospective agreement would give 
investors from either country legally binding rights in the other. 
Emerson stated that "our desire to put in place an investment 
agreement with Mongolia is a clear expression of Canada's commitment 
to building a strong long-term partnership." 
 
Interaction with Canadian Mining Business, 
Diplomats, and NGO Representatives 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) During the January 10 breakfast, Minister Emerson and his 
delegation also heard a range of viewpoints regarding the GOM's 
approach to mining.  Mining representatives delivered consistent 
points to the Minister.  Firms stated they are able and willing to 
handle the commercial aspects of their respective businesses, but 
they want and need foreign governments to project a united front to 
the GOM to cover their  political flank.  In short, the mining 
companies told Canada to join U.S., British, Japanese, Australian 
and German efforts to encourage (cajole, harangue, etc.) the GOM 
into staying out of the mining business while creating a 
transparent, predictable, best practice-based, rule of law approach 
to regulating and profiting from its resource base. 
 
¶6. (SBU) The British Ambassador echoed these sentiments. He noted 
that Mongolia had not really grasped the implications of its 
"Third-Neighbor" policy. Her Majesty's government was reconsidering 
 
ULAANBAATA 00000015  003 OF 004 
 
 
its level of engagement with Mongolia because Britain had little of 
substance on the ground. If Mongolia wanted the British relationship 
to continue or increase, it had to do what was necessary to get 
British investment. If Mongolia really wants to balance China and 
Russia with investment and political support from Britain, the U.S., 
Canada, Japan, etc., then it must create and sustain an environment 
conducive to investment. 
 
¶7. (SBU) The Charge' agreed with the British position, noting the 
USG had consistently and constantly encouraged the GOM to create and 
sustain a solid market environment for all investors.  He added that 
attracting investment also depended on Mongolia giving full and 
careful consideration as well as a timely decision to major 
development project proposals such as the copper-gold mine at Oyu 
Tolgoi. 
 
Chances For A Canadian Embassy In Mongolia Seem Slim 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) Minister Emerson went out of his way to assure his fellow 
Canadians that Canada intended to represent their interests more 
assiduously. He noted that this first ministerial visit in 10 years 
clearly indicated Canada's growing interest in Mongolia. (Note: 
Minister Emerson's Policy Advisor told Commoff that he had to "beg" 
Minister Emerson to take a day in Mongolia.  Apparently, the 
Minister was concerned about the distance between Beijing and 
Ulaanbaatar (two hours flight time). The Advisor also pointed out 
that Canada had at least US$400 million invested in Mongolia with 
the prospect of more in coal, uranium, services, etc., and that the 
Minister should give some push to an emerging portfolio.) He pointed 
out that Canada had just the previous day formally installed a new 
Honorary Canadian Consul, Mr. Alain Fontaine, a very accomplished 
French Canadian who serves as the CEO of one of Mongolia's largest 
technology and infrastructure firms. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) The visit by Canadian Trade Minister Emerson has provided a 
temporary boost in attention here and perhaps in Canada, but it is 
important to note that neither the Mongolians nor the Canadians 
present seemed to be much moved by Canadian protestations of 
interest. One prominent local businessman was extremely indifferent, 
saying he used to get excited about Canadian promises to set up shop 
in Mongolia, but he has been disappointed so many times that he no 
longer believes GOC promises.  After all, the Minister provided no 
time tables for raising the profile on the ground.  And it was only 
after Canadian firms protested loudly to Ottawa in recent years that 
their Beijing Embassy increased the frequency of its brief TDY 
visits to UB from annual to quarterly to monthly levels, albeit not 
always consistently nor with the right officer at the right level. 
And even the Honorary Consul post was left vacant for 18 months. 
Nonetheless, from post's perspective, it was useful for senior 
 
ULAANBAATA 00000015  004 OF 004 
 
 
Mongolian officials to hear messages similar to our own from a 
senior Canadian minister representing their second largest investor, 
and one which can speak from experience of the faults of state 
ownership and participation in the mining sector.  END COMMENT.
