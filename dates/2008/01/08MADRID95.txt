SUBJECT: INVITATION FOR SECRETARY RICE TO ATTEND APRIL 
10-11 MIGRATION FORUM IN ECUADOR 
 
REF: ENANO-ADAMS E-MAILS OF JANUARY 23 
 
Spanish Ibero-American summit organizers have asked the 
Embassy to share an invitation to the Secretary on behalf of 
former long-time Inter-American Development Bank President 
Enrique V. Iglesias.  Iglesias is based in Madrid as General 
Secretary of the Ibero-American General Secretariat (SEGIB). 
 
SIPDIS 
His organization is sponsoring the Ibero-American Forum on 
Migration and Development (FIBEMYD) that will take place in 
Cuenca, Ecuador, on April 10 and 11 with the support of the 
International Organization for Migration.  In a letter dated 
January 9 and shared electronically by Post with the Bureau 
of Western Hemisphere Affairs, Iglesias invites the Secretary 
to participate in this first meeting "given the key role that 
the United States plays . . . (as) the main country of 
destination for Latin-American migration."  SEGIB is inviting 
other government officials, executive heads of international 
organizations, experts, and civil society representatives to 
take part.  Post will forward hard copy of the invitation 
package, including the FIBEYMD's concept document and a 
letter from the mayor of Cuenca, to the attention of WHA/PPC 
for appropriate handling within the Department.  Iglesias 
plans to share additional material and a provisional agenda 
for the two-day forum at a later stage, and requests the 
Secretary accept his invitation at her earliest convenience.
