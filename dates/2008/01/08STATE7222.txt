     ¶C. 2007 NEW DELHI 5410 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request. Please see paragraph 5 & 6. 
 
¶2. (U) Background: The tour of UN Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) 
Force Commander Lt. General Jasbir Singh Lidder, originally 
set to expire in early January (ref a), has been extended 
three months and is set to end in March 2008 (ref b).  We, 
however, would like his tour extended for at least six 
months, through June 2008. UNMIS is the UN peacekeeping 
operation mandated to monitor and support implementation of 
Sudan,s historic Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), which 
ended 21 years of civil war between northern and southern 
Sudan when it was signed on January 9, 2005. Under the CPA, 
the parties to the agreement (e.g. the National Congress 
Party (NCP) and the Sudan Peoples Liberation Movement (SPLM)) 
are provided a six-year interim period during which a census, 
national elections, and a referendum on the South,s final 
status as part of a united or divided Sudan will take place. 
 
¶3. (U) UNMIS is at a critical juncture during the CPA,s 
interim period-- between signing of the agreement and the 
vote on North/South unity in 2011.  Before the onset of the 
rainy season in the spring, Lidder,s leadership and 
expertise is needed to facilitate the redeployment of Sudan 
Armed Forces (SAF) and Sudan People,s Liberation Army (SPLA) 
troops from the border, as well as to lead efforts to train, 
equip, and reposition the Joint Integrated Units (JIUs) (SAF 
& SPLA combined units) in sensitive border and oil regions. 
The extension of Lidder,s tour for at least six months as 
opposed to three months will give him the chance to make 
headway on these pivotal areas before the onset of the rainy 
season when military movement is infeasible. 
 
¶4. TALKING POINTS: 
 
- We believe that Lt. Gen. Jasbir Singh Lidder is an 
effective and capable leader of a very difficult mission. 
Given Lt. Gen. Lidder,s proven track record, we would like 
to see his tour as UNMIS Force Commander extended for at 
least an additional three months, bringing the full extension 
to at least six months. 
 
- We believe that should Lt. Gen. Lidder,s term not be 
extended, it would have an adverse effect on both UNMIS and 
the implementation of the CPA. Without strong and experienced 
leadership, UNMIS,s already challenging mission would be 
made even more difficult. Moreover, the United Nations does 
not yet have a leader positioned to replace him. 
 
- It is also important to note that this request comes at a 
critical time. Progress in certain key areas under Lidder,s 
command, such as the redeployment of SAF and SPLA troops, as 
well as the training and equipping of the JIUs, must continue 
in order to support implementation of the CPA.  Once the 2008 
rainy season begins in May/June, weather conditions will make 
military maneuvering nearly impossible. 
 
- By securing an additional three-month extension of Lt. Gen. 
Lidder,s tour of duty, we will be able to keep UNMIS on 
track and moving forward.  Once the rainy season begins, 
there will be a natural window of time in which to replace 
Lidder, if necessary.  Meanwhile, he will have continued to 
be effective in his role as UNMIS Force Commander. 
¶5.  ACTION REQUEST TO NEW DELHI:  Drawing from the background 
and talking points above, Post is requested to approach 
appropriate high-level officials within the Indian Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Defense to urge an 
extension of Mr. Lidder,s tour for at least an additional 
three months so he can remain in Sudan until the rainy season 
begins in May/June. If his tour can be extended beyond June, 
until his replacement is named for instance, that would be 
ideal. 
 
¶6. ACTION REQUEST USUN: Drawing from the background and 
talking points above, Post is requested to approach Indian UN 
counterparts at the highest possible level to underscore that 
we are requesting an additional extension of UNMIS Force 
Commander Lidder,s tour of duty for at least three months 
and that we are also making similar requests in New Delhi. 
We look forward to India,s cooperation on this issue. 
 
¶7. Please respond no later than January 25. POCs in AF/SPG
