SUBJECT:  MOROCCO:  1989 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF:  A) STATE 363024, B) STATE 31797 
 
Â¶1.  FOLLOWING IS POST'S CONTRIBUTION TO DEPARTMENT'S 
ANNUAL REPORT ON TERRORISM: 
 
IN 1989 THE UNITED STATES AND MOROCCO SIGNED AN 
AGREEMENT ON JOINT COOPERATION IN FIGHTING AGAINST 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, ORGANIZED CRIME AND THE 
ILLICIT PRODUCTION, TRAFFICKING AND ABUSE OF 
NARCOTICS (REF B).  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF 
THIS AGREEMENT, THE UNITED STATES HAS ENJOYED EXCELLENT 
COOPERATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF MOROCCO IN COUNTERING 
TERRORISM. 
 
IN 1983 THE UNITED STATES AND MOROCCO NEGOTIATED A 
MUTUAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE CONVENTION (WHICH INCLUDES 
EXTRADITION PROVISIONS).  THE AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED 
BY THE UNITED STATES, BUT HAS NOT YET BEEN SIGNED BY 
MOROCCO. 
 
MOROCCO SUFFERED FROM LIBYAN SUPPORTED DOMESTIC 
TERRORIST ATTACKS IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES, BUT AS A 
RESULT OF A CHANGING DOMESTIC/REGIONAL POLITICAL 
ENVIRONMENT, THERE IS NO LONGER ANY SIGNIFICANT 
THREAT OF POLITICALLY MOTIVATED TERRORISM IN MOROCCO. 
THE GOVERNMENT OF MOROCCO, AND KING HASSAN II PERSONALLY, 
ARE ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO TERRORISM.  THE PLO HAS MAIN- 
TAINED DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATION IN MOROCCO SINCE 1971, 
AND MOROCCO CONTINUES TO PROVIDE STRONG DIPLOMATIC AND 
POLITICAL BACKING FOR ARAFAT AND THE PLO MAINSTREAM. 
MOROCCO COUNSELS MODERATION TO THE PLO, AND MOROCCAN 
POLICY SEEKS TO PROMOTE A NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT TO 
THE ARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT.  THE MOROCCAN GOVERNMENT, 
THEREFORE, DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY KIND OF SUPPORT  FOR 
TERRORIST GROUPS, WHETHER WITHIN OR OUTSIDE THE PLO 
UMBRELLA. 
 
THERE WERE NO ACTS OF TERRORISM IN MOROCCO IN 1989, AND 
SO, NO PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING TERRORISM.
