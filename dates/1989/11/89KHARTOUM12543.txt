¶1.  THE 1989 ANNUAL TERRORIST REPORT FOR SUDAN IS AS 
FOLLOWS. 
 
¶2.  THE APPEAL PROCEDURE CONTINUED IN 1989 FOR THE FIVE 
DEFENDANTS SENTENCED TO HANG FOR THE MAY 15, 1988, 
BOMBINGS AT THE ACROPOLE HOTEL AND THE SUDAN CLUB, WHICH 
TOOK SEVEN LIVES.  ON SEPTEMBER 25, SUDAN'S DEPUTY CHIEF 
JUSTICE ABDUL MONFIM AL NAHAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE CHARGE 
IN THE CASE WOULD BE CHANGED FROM SECTION 252 OF SUDAN'S 
PENAL CODE TO SECTION 251 (REF C).  THIS CHANGE COULD 
PERMIT THE DEFENDANTS TO ESCAPE THE DEATH PENALTY IF THE 
VICTIMS' KIN ACCEPTED COMPENSATION (DIA) FROM THE GUILTY 
PARTIES.  IN OCTOBER THE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED THAT THE 
KIN OF THE VICTIMS (FIVE BRITISH AND TWO SUDANESE) WOULD 
BE ASKED TO INDICATE BEFORE JANUARY 3, 1990, WHETHER THEY 
WOULD PARDON THE MURDERERS, WITH OR WITHOUT COMPENSATION 
(REF B).  IF THE KIN DID NOT RESPOND OR REFUSED PARDON, 
THE COURT WOULD ORDER THE EXECUTIONS. 
 
¶3.  THE PLO MAINTAINS A CAMP NEAR SUDAN'S RED SEA COAST 
FOR FIGHTERS EVACUATED FROM LEBANON IN 1982.  IN 1989 
THIS CAMP MAINTAINED ITS PREVIOUS LEVELS OF SIZE AND 
ACTIVITY.  THE GOVERNMENT OBSERVES ACTIVITY AT THE CAMP 
CLOSELY. 
 
¶4.  THE GOVERNMENT MADE NO PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN 1989 IN 
SUPPORT OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORIST 
ISSUE.
