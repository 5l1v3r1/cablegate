SUBJECT: CHAD: 1987 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF:  STATE 42378 
 
¶1.  CHAD DOES NOT ENGAGE IN OR SUPPORT INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM.  RATHER, THIS COUNTRY HAS LONG BEEN THE TARGET 
OF TERRORIST ACTIVITIES CARRIED OUT OR SPONSORED BY LIBYA, 
WHOSE ULTIMATE GOAL IS THE DESTRUCTION OF THE HABRE REGIME 
AND THE EXPANSION OF LIBYAN HEGEMONY SOUTHWARD. 
 
¶2.  LIBYAN TERRORISM HAS BEEN LARGELY INEFFECTIVE OVER 
THE PAST YEAR DUE TO A COMBINATION OF ITS OWN INCOMPE- 
TENCE, THE PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES OF ACCESS TO THIS 
ISOLATED LAND, AND (MOST IMPORTANT), THE TIRELESS EFFORTS 
OF THE CHADIAN SECURITY SERVICES, WHICH FOILED SEVERAL 
ATTEMPTS TO SMUGGLE ARMS AND EXPLOSIVES INTO THE COUNTRY. 
 
¶3.  DURING 1987, ONLY TWO ATTEMPTS AT TERRORISM WERE IN 
ANY WAY SUCCESSFUL IN CHAD.  IN MARCH 1987, A LIBYAN- 
SPONSORED TERRORIST ATTEMPTED TO DESTROY A BRIDGE CONNECT- 
ING NDJAMENA TO KOUSSERI IN CAMEROUN.  THE TERRORIST DID 
SUCCEED IN BLOWING HIMSELF UP, BUT ONLY DAMAGED THE 
BRIDGE, WHICH WAS BACK IN LIMITED OPERATION WITHIN HOURS. 
IN OCTOBER 1987, A BUILDING BELONGING TO AN AMERICAN 
PRIVATE VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATION IN THE PROVINCIAL TOWN OF 
MOUNDOU WAS DAMAGED BY AN EXPLOSION FOR WHICH LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES BELIEVE LIBYAN-INSPIRED TERRORISTS WERE 
RESPONSIBLE.
