¶1. (SBU) Summary and action request: The Turkish MFA has 
inquired about the status of two Turkish citizens it claims 
are CF detainees in Iraq.  The MFA filed a diplomatic note 
about one alleged detainee; while it has not done so for the 
other, MFA personnel have made repeated informal inquiries 
with us.  Request MNF-I provide information we can pass to 
the GOT on both detainees.  End summary and action request. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In late August 2005, MFA approached us requesting 
information on the following Turkish citizen, whose family 
had reported him detained by CF earlier that month: 
 
Name: SOYER, Gunay 
Father's Name: Huseyin 
Mother's name: Ese 
Place of birth: Seyhan, Adana, Turkey 
Date of birth: 1975 
 
The Turkish MFA has said that Soyer was "employed by Turkish 
company ERKA, a contractor used by the 39th Wing at Incirlik 
Air Base.  His last place of employment was in Mosul at the 
MFA base (NFI) pump station."  MFA has asked: 
 
--What, if any, charges were pressed against Soyer? 
 
--If he is not charged, on what grounds is he being detained? 
 
--What advice can the MFA pass to his family on the earliest 
possible timing of his release, if found innocent of the 
charges or cleared on any suspicion? 
 
Post was able to learn the following information from Task 
Force Freedom in Mosul: Soyer was detained by MNF-NW soldiers 
for trespassing on a military installation on Aug. 1, and was 
transferred to Abu Ghraib on Aug. 18.  Despite repeated 
inquiries by ODC-Turkey with MNF-I, however, we have received 
no further information on this detainee. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The second detainee is Ali Iskender DINLER 
Father's Name: Huseyin 
Mother's Name: Naime 
Place of Birth: Ankara 
Date of Birth: 1 May 1969 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Turkish MFA sent us the following diplomatic 
note concerning Dinler on Dec. 5.  Informal Embassy 
translation follows: 
 
BEGIN TEXT: 
 
Republic of Turkey 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
 
2005/KOKD/508921 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Turkey 
presents its compliments to the Embassy of the United States 
of America and attaches the copy of the application received 
from Afken Construction, Tourism and Trade Corp. 
 
As clearly noted in the mentioned application, the said 
company started providing food services to Kellogg Brown and 
Root Services (KBR) at the U.S. Military's H1 Palace -- Camp 
Freedom US Military in Mosul in July 2003.  Ali Iskender 
Dinler started working at the mentioned camp as Operation 
Manager.  In April 2005, he was called back to Turkey as he 
had a verbal argument with the Camp Manager Joey Wilson. 
Since then he had been in contact with the KBR authorities in 
Baghdad and Kuwait for business reasons.  Some time ago he 
returned back to the U.S. Military's H1 Palace -- Camp 
Freedom for demobilization of dining-halls.  On November 19, 
2005, the fourth day of his stay in the camp, he was 
interrogated by the security guards of the KBR officials, was 
notified that he was banned from entering the camp, and was 
handed over to the US military authorities.  Since then he 
has been under detention and under interrogation somewhere 
and he has not been released yet.  During this period, Akfen 
has provided the US Army Officer Marcus T. Lewis all the 
 
ANKARA 00007302  002 OF 002 
 
 
information he requested through email.  The mentioned 
application requests the release of the said person (Mr. 
Dinler) who has been successfully working at their company 
and has committed no crime. 
 
The Ministry requests an investigation and information about 
the whereabouts of the noted person by using the above 
mentioned information and the attached documents. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Turkey 
avails itself of the opportunity to renew to the Embassy of 
the USA the assurances of its highest consideration. 
 
Ankara, December 5, 2005

¶5. (SBU) In addition to the diplomatic note, MFA provided us 
a series of emails between Dinler's company, Akfen, and a SGT 
Marcus T. Lewis, U.S. Army Force Protection, Mosul (email 
address marcus.t.lewis@us.army.mil).  Post has also received 
an inquiry on this case from the President of the Turkish 
Human Rights Association.
