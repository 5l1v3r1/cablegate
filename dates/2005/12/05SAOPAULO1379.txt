¶1. (U) On Wednesday, 12/14/05 at approximately 2130 hours, a 
locally employed Brazilian staff member was assaulted at 
gunpoint while stopped in traffic in her vehicle. According 
to the victim's accounts, 2 males and an elderly female 
approached her vehicle at a traffic light. One of the males 
asked the victim to take the elderly female to a local 
hospital. When the victim refused to roll down her car 
window, one of the males aimed a pistol at her head and 
ordered her to exit the vehicle. The victim was then placed 
in the back-seat of the vehicle where the perpetrator held a 
"moist cloth" with "chemicals" over her nose and mouth. 
Nearly 12 hours later, the victim said she regained 
consciousness at approximately 0900 hours on 12/15/05. When 
she did regain consciousness, the victim stated that she was 
inside her own vehicle within close proximity to the traffic 
light where the incident reportedly occurred. None of her 
valuables, including cash and credit cards were missing and 
she did not report any injuries. 
 
¶2. (U) On 12/15/05, the RSO office immediately instructed the 
employee to seek medical attention and file a police report. 
RSO and local FSNIs are currently following up with the 
police, medical personnel and the victim to further 
investigate this incident. 
 
¶3. (U) It is noteworthy that the street on which this 
incident occurred is frequently used as a main traffic artery 
for people traveling to and from Sao Paulo's domestic airport 
(Congonhas). The street is lined with illegally erected 
low-income housing slums. The RSO office is currently 
analyzing viable alternate vehicle routes to the Congonhas 
airport and these alternate routes are being included in the 
pending security notice advising employees of this incident. 
 
¶4. (U) On the morning of 12/15/05, the RSO office also 
received initial reports of an armed robbery that occurred 
inside Sao Paulo's international airport (Cumbica) . The 
Spouse of the Honorary Consul General of Honduras was 
reportedly robbed at gunpoint directly in front of the 
American Airlines ticket counter by a male dressed in a suit 
and tie. There were no reports of any injuries or arrests 
following the robbery. RSO and FSNIs have made inquiries to 
airport police authorities to obtain additional details 
regarding this incident. RSO will provide additional 
information should it become available.
