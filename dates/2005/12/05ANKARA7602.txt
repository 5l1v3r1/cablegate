BRIEFING 
 
2006 Budget Approval:  All papers and TV channels report on 
escalating tensions in Parliament during 2006 budget 
debates.  While the AKP government tried to paint a rosy 
picture regarding Turkey's situation, the opposition 
parties, especially the CHP and its leader Baykal accused 
the government of corruption and favoritism.  "Milliyet" 
reports that after 19 hours of heated debate, the parliament 
approved the 2006 budget. 
 
A New Era in the Turkey-Egypt Relationship:  "Posta", 
"Zaman" and "Cumhuriyet" report that a new era started in 
Turkey-Egypt relations with President Sezer's two-day visit 
there.  "Cumhuriyet" reports that in his statement after the 
meeting with President Mubarak, President Sezer said that 
the two countries had to coordinate their efforts for 
security and stability in the Middle East.  The paper adds 
that Turkey and Egypt signed a free trade agreement 
yesterday. 
 
Orhan Pamuk Case:   "Hurriyet", "Milliyet", "Sabah" and 
"Radikal" report that the Court of Appeals announced 
yesterday that they need the Justice Minister's approval to 
take legal action against those who insulted Turkish 
identity before June 1 when the new penal code came to 
effect.  "Hurriyet" reports that Justice Minister Cemil 
Cicek called for patience on the subject of the new penal 
code and pending cases. 
 
Investigation Launched Against Lagendijk:  "Sabah" reports 
that the Istanbul Prosecutor's Office launched an 
 
ANKARA 00007602  002 OF 003 
 
 
investigation against EU's Lagendijk for insulting the 
Republic of Turkey as well as its military.  "Yeni Safak" 
says that all cases related to article 301 become an anti-EU 
campaign and, thus, 301 indirectly becomes the EU's problem. 
The investigation against Lagendijk as well will be 
conducted under articles 301 and 288. 
 
KDP Delegation in Ankara:  "Sabah", "Cumhuriyet" and 
"Radikal" report that a delegation from the Iraqi Kurdistan 
Party (KDP) was in Ankara yesterday for the first talks 
between Turkish officials and Iraqi Kurds since Iraqi 
elections earlier this month. 
 
RTUK Permission for Kurdish Broadcasting:  "Radikal" and 
"Aksam" report that RTUK (Radio and Television High 
Commission) gave permission to 12 private radio and TV 
stations to broadcast in Kurdish.  "Aksam" says that RTUK 
ruled that the broadcasts should not last more than 45 
minutes a day nor total more than 4 hours in a week. 
 
EDITORIAL OPINION:   Iran 
 
"Troublemaking Comrades" 
Abdulhamit Bilici observed in the Islamist-intellectual 
"Zaman" (12/28):  "Turkey is surrounded by careless figures, 
and this reinforces the importance of our own domestic 
stability.  One of the troublemakers right next door is 
Saddam, currently on trial.  The entire region and later the 
entire world suffered for years because of his troublesome 
policies.  A close, cold-blooded analysis of the recent 
events would prove that Saddam Hussein laid the ground work 
for the position of both the PKK and Al Qaeda today.  Iraq's 
invasion of Kuwait was the beginning of the US presence in 
the region. As for the PKK, one should never forget that the 
PKK managed to put down roots in the north of Iraq once 
Saddam lost control of the region. Another immediate 
neighbor, Syria, is no different.  We should remember that 
Assad's father hosted the leader of the PKK in Syria for 14 
years.  The Syrian occupation of Lebanon under the pretext 
of stopping civil war resulted in the Bekaa valley becoming 
a base for terrorist organizations.  The new Assad regime 
has been very sympathetic to Turkey, but there are some 
inherited problems related to Lebanon which seem to be a 
very big headache for Damascus.  Finally, the harsh 
statements from the Iranian leader have caused more 
speculation regarding a possible American operation.  It 
seems Turkey is on a road filled with reckless drivers.  We 
had better ask if we can really trust Iranian companionship 
on this road trip." 
 
"The Iranian Deadlock" 
Sami Kohen commented in the mainstream daily "Milliyet" 
(12/28): "The world community is more concerned about Iran's 
nuclear program than the radical statements against Israel. 
There is international consensus regarding the need to stop 
the Iranian nuclear program.  That means there is a common 
perception that Iran is capable of producing an atomic bomb 
if it starts a uranium enrichment program. The character and 
behavior of the leaders of the Iranian regime are creating 
more concern for the world.  It remains to be seen whether 
Iran will choose to compromise with the world.  If consensus 
cannot be reached, most likely the US will force the United 
Nations into imposing sanctions.  It is also not out of the 
question to see a targeted operation against Iran by Israel. 
These are certainly radical scenarios and hopefully 
international diplomacy will prevail before a serious crisis 
knocks at the door.  Otherwise, Turkey will find itself in a 
very difficult situation."
