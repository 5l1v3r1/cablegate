SUBJECT: IRAN DENIES ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON AHMADINEJAD 
 
¶1. Iranian government spokesman Golamhoseyn Elham has denied 
reports of a December 15 assassination attempt on Iranian 
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. He confirmed, however, that a 
Revolutionary Guardsman -- identified by Iran Daily as

car's occupants were killed by bullet fire. 
-- An "informed source" told Farda News the vehicle was 
performing a security check on the route Ahmadinejad's motorcade 
was to take, although the bandits were unaware of the victims 
and only sought to steal the vehicle. 
 
-- WorldNetDaily.com cites a Jomhuri-ye Islami report -- an 
extremely conservative Tehran-based paper -- that at 6:50pm the 
lead car in the presidential motorcade was ambushed by "armed 
bandits and troublemakers," killing the driver and one of 
Ahmadinejad's bodyguards.  Ahmadinejad was not in the car at the 
time.
