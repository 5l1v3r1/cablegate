¶1. (SBU) Daniel Joly, Director of the Iraq program at the 
Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) assured 
polmiloff late on December 7 that Canadian funding for 2006 
training at the JIPTC would be authorized before the end of 
the year.  The funding package already had been reviewed 
against stringent guidelines on what the Minister could and 
could not do following dissolution of the government, Joly 
said, and there was no obstacle to approval. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Moreover, Joly continued, International Cooperation 
Minister Carroll was "personally committed" to continuing 
Canada's support for training of the Iraqi police force in 
the wake of her visit to the JIPTC earlier this year.  The 
formality of the Minister's signature was all that remained 
to authorize CAD 7.5 million for 2006, and it would be done 
at the "earliest opportunity," he concluded
