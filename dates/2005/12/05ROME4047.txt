Italy strongly condemns and reproves the attack in Beirut 
that cost the life of Gebran Tueni, whom we remember for the 
courage in which he always supported the idea of a sovereign 
and independent Lebanon. 
 
There must be end an to terrorist violence, which in all its 
horror returned to strike a symbol of liberty right at a time 
when Lebanese democracy is proceeding with great courage 
towards full sovereignty. 
 
Italy stands beside the Government and people of Lebanon in 
this most recent painful moment and will not fail to give its 
own firm support to the initiatives taken to bring clarity on 
the causes and modalities of the attack.
