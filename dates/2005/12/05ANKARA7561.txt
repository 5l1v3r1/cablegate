¶1.  Summary:  To supplement a proposed $15 million Bank 
loan, the World Bank seeks a partnership role with USAID 
in a package to assist Turkey's Avian and Human Pandemic 
Influenza readiness.  Bank staff sees potential for USAID 
contribution on early surveillance training, 
communication, protective gear, and mobile incineration 
equipment, and would hope that a relationship could be 
structured on a sustained, multi-year basis.  End 
Summary.

¶2.  (SBU)  In a December 20 meeting, World Bank lead 
Agricultural Economist Mark Lundell and Ankara-based 
colleagues said Bank staff would be approaching USAID to 
discuss joint work to further Turkey's AI preparedness. 
The Bank is aiming to fashion a $15 million AI loan to 
Turkey, but the GOT is insisting that this be 
supplemented by a comparable amount of grants.  While 
this amount of grants may not be achievable, the World 
Bank would welcome significant contributions toward this 
goal from USAID, EU, FAO, and other partners. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  The planned facility is aimed at both animal 
influenza and human pandemic readiness, focusing on 
prevention, preparedness and planning, as well as 
response and containment.  It aims particularly at 
training for early surveillance, augmenting veterinary 
epidemiological expertise, and building capacity for 
potential multiple outbreaks.  Attempting to coordinate 
sustained contributions with other partners, the World 
Bank is focusing much of its assistance on strengthening 
culling compensation funds, establishing an AI 
secretariat at the Prime Ministry, and restructuring 
 
SIPDIS 
affected poultry broiler and layer industries. 
Recognizing that EU pre-accession assistance is not quick 
acting, the World Bank envisions an potential role for 
USAID to fill short-term gaps in: 
 
-Fashioning and augmenting training for surveillance 
-Facilitating public communication strategies (the first 
hurdle is implementing measures to communicate; then 
establishing best approaches for communication) 
-Contributing personal protective gear and clothing 
-Contributing mobile incineration equipment 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Lundell observed that any of the above action 
items might fit nicely with USAID activities and goals in 
other "front line" countries like Romania and Ukraine. 
As noted already by USAID, improvements to veterinary and 
health systems will address other diseases as well.  The 
World Bank reps said the GOT has been very receptive to 
advice on quickly stepping up AI readiness and 
preparedness (apart from harping on the goal of grants 
comprising 50% of the total package, stemming from global 
goals expressed at WHO AI conferences). 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  Comment: Turkey experienced one confirmed 
outbreak of H5N1 in early October (reftels).  Although 
the GOT received high marks for quickly containing the 
outbreak (benefiting from EU training and a simulation), 
the economic impact to the poultry and egg industry was 
severe.  The main conclusions of a November USAID visit 
(ref A) were: there is a need and a possible USAID role 
to augment/assist GOT's ability to respond to multiple 
outbreaks, to educate both farmers and consumers on the 
virus, and to establish and empower a supra-governmental 
authority for AI readiness.   Given Turkey's location on 
major Asia-Africa migratory flyways, there is an urgency

to mitigate these risk areas before any new outbreaks 
occur.
