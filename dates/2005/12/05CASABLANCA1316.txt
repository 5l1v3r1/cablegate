SUBJECT:  IOM AND GOVERNMENT OF MOROCCO HOLD JOINT 
CONFERENCE ON MIGRATION AND RELIGION 
 
 
¶1.  (U) This cable is sensitive but unclassified.  Please 
protect accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (U) Marking International Migrants Day, December 18, the 
International Organization of Migration (IOM) released a 
statement saying, "More attention should be paid by the 
international community to the large numbers of migrants 
stranded far from their homes and in need of assistance and 
protection."  These sentiments were closely echoed earlier 
this month at a conference organized by IOM and the Moroccan 
Ministry in Charge of Moroccans Living Abroad.  The 
conference, held on December 5-6, entitled "Migration and 
Religion in a Globalized World", drew participants from over 
40 countries and formally addressed such topics as, the role 
of religion in the migratory process, the role of the media, 
and the sensitization of youth to religious tolerance. 
Informally, however, many of the speakers tied their 
presentations to terrorism often linked to immigrants and 
the perceptions and misperceptions of Islam in the West.

Opening Remarks Address Concerns of Terrorism 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (U) Prime Minister Driss Jettou opened the conference by 
reaffirming Morocco's commitment to its international 
obligation to preserve the identity and rights of migrants. 
Morocco has a long history of supporting diversity, said 
Jettou, and will continue to do so.  The PM, however, very 
quickly zeroed in on the challenges many countries, and 
Morocco in particular, are facing regarding clandestine 
migration and its links to organized crime, as well as the 
problem of international terrorism unreasonably veiled under 
the cover of religion. 
 
¶4.  (U) The injustice of the perceived linking of Islam and 
terrorism in the West was a sentiment that was seconded by 
another of the opening speakers, Nezha Chekrouni, Minister 
Delegate in Charge of Moroccans Living Abroad, who was the 
motivating force behind the conference.  The Minister 
reminded listeners that Arabs too are victims of terrorism 
and that terrorism by its very nature can not be Islamic. 
Her strongest point, however, was hammered home when she 
relayed her belief that xenophobia will greatly hinder the 
forward march of democracy and only democracy will put an 
end to terrorism. 
 
------------------------------ 
Calls for Tolerance and Respect 
------------------------------ 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The speakers were unanimous in their desire to see 
the international community adopt an approach to migration 
based on tolerance and respect.  Panels addressed what they 
see as a desperate need for education on religious tolerance 
and highlighted the necessity to concentrate on the younger 
generations from both the sending and the host country 
communities.  Many panel members called on Governments in 
both host and originating countries to step in and lead the 
way.  According to the Senegalese Minister of Senegalese 
Abroad "Western youth should be educated on Islam and in 
return there should be no fear of the West here." 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The role of the media was emphasized as well, 
underscoring the influential and crucial function it plays. 
The consensus was that the media can act as a bridge or a 
chasm between immigrants and their new country influencing 
public opinion on migration and religion.  One participant, 
an official from Algerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
denounced Western media blaming it for the demonization of 
Islam after the attacks in Spain and London, as well as on 
CONFERENCE ON MIGRATION AND RELIGION 
 
the World Trade Center.  The media, he claimed, is creating 
an atmosphere of prejudice and intolerance in the West. 
While another panelist pointed to the beneficial ties the 
media has helped to create, linking immigrants to their home 
countries via satellite broadcasts and internet media 
access.

Eating Couscous in Amsterdam 
---------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (U) While many of the participants spoke from a strictly 
eastern or western perspective two panelists presented a 
unique viewpoint reserved for those with a foothold in each 
world.  Mohamed Baba, a Dutch-Moroccan partner in Mex-it, 
Advisors on Intercultural Management and Fatima Elatik, a 
Dutch-Moroccan, Vice-Governor of the district of Zeeburg in 
Amsterdam, spoke of their experiences as second generation 
Muslims living in Europe.  According to Baba the way to see 
successful integration of immigrants, and consequently 
lessen the threat of extremism, is to concentrate on better 
housing, education, and jobs.  Additionally, new stiffer 
security measures, he claims, are hardening the society and 
forcing people to adopt negative attitudes towards new 
immigrants, hindering integration.  Elatik, an outspoken 
woman sporting a headscarf fashionably knotted behind her 
neck, spoke plainly about the problem of migrants in Europe 
as a problem of integration not a problem of Islam.  After 
three generations of citizenship, she stated, "people like 
me are still called immigrants and that has to stop." 
Muslims in Europe, in her opinion, are struggling to find 
their identity and that may be part of what is leading some 
to the threshold of extremism.  Acceptance and integration, 
she advised, are the only answers. 
 
------------ 
No Easy Task 
------------ 
 
¶8.  (U) Minister Delegate Chekrouni closed the conference by 
reminding the participants that, for most immigrants, 
reconciling their principles and values with those of their 
host countries is not an easy task.  It is, however, vital 
that all immigrants respect the laws in force in their host 
countries.  She wrapped up by reminding everyone that the 
objective of the conference was to create a space for 
dialogue on the issue and stressed the idea that "the 
adversary that we should face is extremism."

Comment

¶9.  (SBU) The goal of the conference in opening up a 
dialogue to explore the link between religion and migration 
in order to help governments form policies was well served 
and Minister Delegate Chekrouni is to be congratulated for 
her role in organizing the conference.  However, sadly 
lacking from the discussion was any mention, beyond the 
opening remarks of PM Jettou, of the challenges faced by 
countries, like Morocco, who are not only originating but 
destination countries for migrants.  While rightly demanding 
that its citizens abroad are treated justly, Morocco must 
demonstrate to the international community its respect for 
those who cross its borders in search of a better way of 
life.  GREENE
