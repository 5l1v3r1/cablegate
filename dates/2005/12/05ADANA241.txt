rector has been acquitted of the charges against him for not 
officially declaring and registering historical artifacts he 
allegedly kept possession of, because of lack of evidence.  The

in the meeting.  DTP Co-Chairperson Aysel Tugluk said that 
trying to come out with a solution (to the Kurdish issue) 
without us, without the representatives of the Kurdish people,

determine their own fate.

raporteur on Turkey, who came to Turkey to attend as an observer 
to the trial of the author Orhan Pamuk, told a Firat news Agency

was weakening.  If this situation continued, our relationships 
with Turkey will suffer serious problems, said Eurlings. 
According to Eurling, the Semdinli incident is a really grave 
problem which should be probed thoroughly; and what they hoped 
to see in southeastern Turkey was not an environment dominated 
by a heavy military presence, but one where civilians were in 
charge in addressing the issues.
