SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION: TRADE; QUITO 
 
Â¶1.  "WTO:  Discriminatory Globalization," an 
editorial (12/22) in Quito's leading centrist "El 
Comercio" (circ. 70,000) 
 
Quote:  ". . .although it is ironic from the 
perspective of underdeveloped countries, an agreement 
was reached, or better still a circumstantial way out 
so that eight years from now the agricultural 
subsidies that protect that activity in many 
countries of the developed world will be eliminated. 
 
"The result, a precarious achievement of delayed 
execution, is very dangerous, because it means that 
the economic liberalization of the world has two 
faces with very different fates.  One is the 
developed one, which protects its extraordinary 
technological development sheltering an unproductive 
and incompetent agricultural field; that balances the 
distribution of the GDP -via compensations-without 
affecting the economic stability of the system or 
attempting against the social structure of its 
historical urban centers. 
 
"The other face is located in underdeveloped 
countries.  It is endowed with a great agricultural 
field that is prevented from incorporating into the 
large world markets, while its poverty indexes grow 
dangerously. 
 
". . . It is comprehensible that in the aftermath of 
the fall of the Berlin wall the end of history was 
considered to have arrived, but it becomes 
inconceivable that [the developed world] had 
forgotten that hunger and marginalization were at the 
core of all revolutions in history."
