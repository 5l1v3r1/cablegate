------------------------ 
Summary and Introduction 
------------------------ 
 
¶1. (SBU) This cable includes the full text of the December 
11 revised Afghanistan Compact and three Annexes for 
Washington review.  This final revision reflects the bulk of 
consensus recommendations reached at a series of December 2- 
5 PrepCom meetings held on the margins of the Kabul Regional 
Economic Cooperation Conference (Ref A) as well as stylistic 
changes that tighten the text and clarify its message by 
creating a preamble, and  "Purpose" and "Principles of 
Cooperation" introductory sections.  In the paragraphs below 
we highlight key final modifications to the Compact text. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Beyond areas of critical policy concern we believe 
it is time to stop dealing with issues of language and form. 
We have some of what we want.  So do others.  We need to 
close on the compact, particularly on the benchmarks, and 
start working on other donors to fund the large projects 
necessary for victory in Afghanistan.  Ultimately this 
compact is about hard political reforms and audacious 
development.  We need to get on with it and only reclama on 
major substantive issues.  The GoA and UNAMA request final 
comments NLT December 15.  They request also that all 
comments come through ambassadors and not/not via the 
conference call, in which the GoA no longer intends to 
participate (See para 11).  End Summary. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Compact Chapeau:  Key Modifications 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) This section is rewritten in a form to add punch. 
It now has complete GoA buy-in.  The substance is what we 
agreed to except for issues noted below: 
 
¶4. (SBU) The introduction to the "Purpose" section removes 
earlier references to the GoA "seeking the support of the 
international community for the implementation of the Afghan 
National Development Strategy (ANDS)."  PrepCom participants 
thought this language inappropriate given that the ANDS is a 
wholly GoA driven strategy and, in any case, premature given 
that a Final ANDS has yet to be released by the GoA.   The 
current version of the compact chapeau also removed an 
earlier statement that "The mechanism for implementing the 
commitments under this compact will be the ANDS"because a 
later statement in the final paragraph of the Compact 
chapeau names the joint coordination and monitoring 
mechanism as the Compact's implementing vehicle. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) In the "Principles of Cooperation" section, a new 
point has been added: "Recognize the importance of gender in 
all policies and programs."  In the "Security" section, 
language has been modified to recognize the contribution of 
"partner nations" to security sector reform in addition to 
OEF and NATO/ISAF forces.  In the "Governance, Rule of Law 
and Human Rights" section, language has been added on 
promoting justice and building a fiscally sustainable 
administration for future elections. In the "Economic and 
Social Development" section, the introduction to the five 
basic priorities has been changed to a declarative "Public 
investment will be structured around five basic priorities 
of the ANDS" and objective language has been added to expand 
employment generation and enterprise creation. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) In the chapeau's "Counter-Narcotics - a 
Crosscutting Priority" section, a notable omission is the 
absence of eradication from a CN strategy list that includes 
interdiction, law enforcement, judicial capacity building, 
enhanced regional cooperation, alternative livelihoods and 
institution building.  In a December 10 UNAMA meeting with G- 
8 ambassadors, Ambassador Neumann flagged this omission and 
strongly called for its inclusion as a statement that both 
donors and the GoA accept both the legitimacy and practical 
necessity of eradication as one of the tools to fight 
Afghanistan's narcotics scourge.  Subsequently, language in 
the Annex I counter-narcotics Security Benchmark was 
strengthened considerably to read "The government will 
strengthen its law enforcement capacity at both central and 
provincial levels, resulting in a substantial annual 
increase in the amounts of drugs seized or destroyed."  We 
are inclined to push back once more on the language in the 
cover document but accept this compromise.  UK support for a 
push to include the word eradication would be helpful.  We 
await Washington's guidance. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Annex I: Benchmarks - Key Modifications 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) The extended benchmark (BM) section adds a small 
chapeau committing the GoA, with the support of the 
international community to achieving all BMs within the 5- 
year timeframe of the Compact.  In the "Security" section 
reference to the size of ANA forces, disagreement remains 
over whether to modify the 70,000 target by including our 
proposed language of the phrase "up to", now retained in 
brackets before the 70,000 figure.   "Up to" language is 
also bracketed before the police manning figure but the 
police language will follow whatever is agreed to on the ANA 
language.  Given the cross-cutting priorities associated 
with counter-narcotics efforts, the BM's text is now divided 
between the Security, Governance, Agriculture and Rural 
Development, and Social Protection sections. The Gender 
section has been strengthened with language added requiring 
the National Action Plan for Women in Afghanistan to be 
fully implemented. The Agriculture and Livestock BM has been 
strengthened, with language mandating a 30 percent increase 
in public investment in agriculture (vice a 30 percent 
increase in investment in creating an "enabling environment 
for agriculture.") 
 
¶8. (SBU) In the Economic Governance and Private Sector 
Development section, controversial Financial Management BM 
language detailing specific targets for the share of donor 
assistance flowing through the GoA's Core Budget was 
softened at the request of the US, Germany and Japan to read 
".donors will make every effort to increase the share of 
total external assistance to Afghanistan that goes to the 
core Budget."  In extended discussion on the also 
controversial Domestic Revenues BM, a GoA/IFI/US/UK working 
group has revised the measurement of the GoA's core budget 
expenses to include World Bank estimates of previously off- 
budget recurring costs associated with the ANA, ANP, 
education and health care, as well as projected recurring 
parliamentary and election expenses. The benchmark now 
details an increasing share of domestic revenues as a 
percentage of this revised budget, models budget revenues as 
a percentage of GDP and refers to a "continuing need, in 
accordance with the principles in Annex II, for (1) external 
assistance to the core budget and (2) increasing cost 
effectiveness of assistance that funds recurrent expenditure 
through the external development budget."  We suggest 
accepting this language.  Finally, a new BM on Regional 
Cooperation was added, referring to working initiatives 
agreed upon at the December Regional Economic Cooperation 
Conference. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Annex II: AID Effectiveness - Key Modifications 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶9.  (SBU) Annex II adds a welcome point calling on the GoA 
to improve its ability to generate domestic revenues through 
customs duties and taxes and to achieve cost recovery 
through public utilities and transportation.  On donor 
commitments, language on multi-year commitments is modified 
to read "Increasingly provide more predictable and multi- 
year funding commitments or indications of multi-year 
support.".  Language is added asking donors to "avoid 
activities that undermine national institution building and 
limit the use of top-ups which will not be sustainable in 
the medium term." 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
Annex III: Coordination/Monitoring - Key Modifications 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
¶10. (SBU) In Annex III, language was added to clarify that 
".the Board supplements existing consultative mechanisms 
between the GoA and the international community."  It also 
clarifies that the Board will be "supported by technical 
experts and financial assistance, as needed."  This section 
caused a great deal of discussion with the GoA and the IFIs, 
both of whom were concerned about setting up parallel 
monitoring bureaucracies.  We believe we have enough eyes on 
the ground to know when things are going wrong.  We have 
what we need and recommend accepting this Annex without 
further change. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Final Comments Due by December 15 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶11.  At this same December 10 meeting, UNAMA Deputy SRSG Haq 
emphasized the need for final comments from G-8 + capitals 
by December 15 in order to meet the timelines agreed to at 
the December 2-5 PrepCom sessions. The GoA requested all 
changes be received through Ambassadors.  They feel the G-8 
conference call mechanism sets of confusing dual tracks. 
The GoA has decided no longer to participate in those calls. 
(Comment:  The GoA is firm.  While we did not prompt this 
decision, we endorse it, as the use of a conference call in 
which many Ambassadors here did not participate was causing 
increasing policy confusion. End Comment)

THE AFGHANISTAN COMPACT BETWEEN THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF 
AFGHANISTAN AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
 
THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN AND THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY: 
 
DETERMINED TO STRENGTHEN THEIR PARTNERSHIP TO IMPROVE THE 
LIVES OF AFGHAN PEOPLE, AND TO CONTRIBUTE TO NATIONAL, 
REGIONAL, AND GLOBAL PEACE AND SECURITY; 
 
AFFIRMING THEIR SHARED COMMITMENTS TO CONTINUE, IN THE 
SPIRIT OF THE BONN, TOKYO, AND BERLIN CONFERENCES, TO WORK 
TOWARD A STABLE AND PROSPEROUS AFGHANISTAN, WITH GOOD 
GOVERNANCE AND HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION FOR ALL UNDER THE 
RULE OF LAW AND MAINTAIN THAT COMMITMENT OVER THE TERM OF 
THIS COMPACT AND BEYOND; 
 
RECOGNIZING THE COURAGE AND DETERMINATION OF AFGHANS WHO, BY 
DEFYING VIOLENT EXTREMISM AND HARDSHIP, HAVE LAID THE 
FOUNDATIONS FOR A PEACEFUL, PLURALISTIC AND PROSPEROUS STATE 
EMBRACING THE PRINCIPLES OF ISLAM AND DEMOCRACY; 
 
NOTING THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BONN AGREEMENT THROUGH 
THE ADOPTION OF A NEW CONSTITUTION IN JANUARY 2004 AND THE 
HOLDING OF PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS IN OCTOBER 2004 AND 
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY AND PROVINCIAL COUNCIL ELECTIONS IN 
SEPTEMBER 2005, WHICH HAVE ENABLED AFGHANISTAN TO REGAIN ITS 
RIGHTFUL PLACE IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY; 
 
MINDFUL THAT AFGHANISTAN'S TRANSITION TO PEACE AND STABILITY 
IS NOT YET ASSURED, AND THAT STRONG INTERNATIONAL ENGAGEMENT 
WILL CONTINUE TO BE REQUIRED TO ADDRESS REMAINING 
CHALLENGES;

BY SETTING CONDITIONS FOR SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND 
DEVELOPMENT; STRENGTHENING STATE INSTITUTIONS AND CIVIL 
SOCIETY; REMOVING REMAINING TERRORIST THREATS; MEETING THE 
CHALLENGE OF COUNTER-NARCOTICS; REBUILDING CAPACITY AND 
INFRASTRUCTURE; REDUCING POVERTY; AND MEETING BASIC HUMAN 
NEEDS; 
 
HAVE AGREED TO THIS AFGHANISTAN COMPACT. 
 
PURPOSE 
 
THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT HAS ARTICULATED ITS OVERARCHING GOALS 
FOR THE WELL BEING OF ITS PEOPLE IN THE AFGHANISTAN 
MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS REPORT 2005.  CONSISTENT WITH 
THOSE GOALS, THIS COMPACT IDENTIFIES THREE CRITICAL AND 
INTERDEPENDENT AREAS OR "PILLARS" OF ACTIVITY FOR THE FIVE 
YEARS FROM THE ADOPTION OF THIS COMPACT: 
 
¶1.   SECURITY; 
 
¶2.   GOVERNANCE, RULE OF LAW, AND HUMAN RIGHTS; AND 
 
¶3.   SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT. 
A FURTHER VITAL AND CROSSCUTTING AREA OF WORK IS ELIMINATING 
THE NARCOTICS INDUSTRY, WHICH REMAINS A FORMIDABLE THREAT TO 
THE PEOPLE AND STATE OF AFGHANISTAN, THE REGION, AND BEYOND. 
 
THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT HEREBY COMMITS ITSELF TO REALIZING 
THIS SHARED VISION OF THE FUTURE; THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY RECIPROCALLY COMMITS ITSELF TO PROVIDE THE 
RESOURCES AND SUPPORT TO REALIZE THAT VISION.  ANNEX I SETS 
OUT DETAILED OUTCOMES, BENCHMARKS, AND TIMELINES FOR 
DELIVERY, CONSISTENT WITH THE HIGH-LEVEL GOALS SET BY THE 
ANDS.  THE GOVERNMENT AND INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ALSO 
COMMIT THEMSELVES TO IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS AND 
ACCOUNTABILITY OF INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE AS SET FORTH IN 
ANNEX 2. 
 
PRINCIPLES OF COOPERATION 
 
AS THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
EMBARK ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS COMPACT, THEY WILL: 
 
¶1.   WORK ON THE BASIS OF PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE AFGHAN 
  GOVERNMENT, WITH ITS SOVEREIGN RESPONSIBILITIES, AND THE 
  INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, WITH A CENTRAL AND IMPARTIAL 
  COORDINATING ROLE FOR THE UNITED NATIONS; 
 
¶2.   RESPECT THE CULTURE, VALUES AND HISTORY OF AFGHANISTAN, 
  BASED ON ISLAM; 
 
¶3.   ENLIST FURTHER THE DEEP-SEATED CULTURE OF PARTICIPATION 
  AND ASPIRATION TO OWNERSHIP OF THE AFGHAN PEOPLE; 
 
¶4.   PURSUE FISCAL, INSTITUTIONAL, AND ENVIRONMENTAL 
  SUSTAINABILITY;

  INTERNATIONAL RESOURCES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IN ORDER TO 
  OFFER ALL AFGHANS TANGIBLE PROSPECTS OF WELL-BEING IN AN 
  EQUITABLE MANNER; 
¶7.   RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF GENDER IN ALL POLICIES AND 
  PROGRAMS; 
 
¶8.   PROMOTE REGIONAL COOPERATION; AND 
 
¶9.   COMBAT CORRUPTION AND ENSURE PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY AND 
ACCOUNTABILITY IN RESOURCE ALLOCATION AND PROGRAM 
IMPLEMENTATION. 
SECURITY 
 
GENUINE SECURITY REMAINS A FUNDAMENTAL PREREQUISITE FOR 
ACHIEVING STABILITY AND DEVELOPMENT IN AFGHANISTAN. 
SECURITY CANNOT BE PROVIDED BY MILITARY MEANS ALONE.  IT 
REQUIRES GOOD GOVERNANCE, JUSTICE, AND THE RULE OF LAW, 
REINFORCED BY RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT.  THE AFGHAN 
GOVERNMENT AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WILL CREATE A 
SECURE ENVIRONMENT BY DISBANDING ALL ILLEGAL ARMED GROUPS 
AND ENABLING AFGHAN INSTITUTIONS TO MEET THE SECURITY NEEDS 
OF THE COUNTRY IN A FISCALLY SUSTAINABLE MANNER. 
 
TO THAT END, THE NATO-LED INTERNATIONAL SECURITY ASSISTANCE 
FORCE (ISAF), THE US-LED OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM (OEF), 
AND PARTNER NATIONS INVOLVED IN SECURITY SECTOR REFORM WILL 
CONTINUE TO PROVIDE STRONG SUPPORT TO THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT 
IN ESTABLISHING AND SUSTAINING SECURITY AND STABILITY IN 
AFGHANISTAN.  THEY WILL CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN AND DEVELOP 
THE CAPACITY OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY FORCES TO ENSURE THAT 
THEY BECOME FULLY FUNCTIONAL.  OEF FORCES WILL CONTINUE TO 
CONDUCT COUNTER-TERRORISM OPERATIONS IN CLOSE COORDINATION 
WITH THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT AND ISAF.  ISAF WILL CONTINUE TO 
EXPAND ITS PRESENCE THROUGHOUT AFGHANISTAN PRIMARILY THROUGH 
PROVINCIAL RECONSTRUCTION TEAMS (PRTS) AND WILL CONTINUE TO 
PROMOTE STABILITY AND SUPPORT SECURITY SECTOR REFORMS IN ITS 
AREAS OF OPERATION. 
 
     FULL RESPECT FOR AFGHANISTAN'S SOVEREIGNTY AND 
STRENGTHENING DIALOGUE AND COOPERATION BETWEEN AFGHANISTAN 
AND ITS NEIGHBORS CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL GUARANTEE OF 
STABILITY IN AFGHANISTAN AND THE REGION.  THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY WILL SUPPORT CONCRETE MEASURES TO THIS END. 
 
GOVERNANCE, RULE OF LAW, AND HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT WILL RAPIDLY EXPAND ITS CAPACITY TO 
PROVIDE BASIC SERVICES TO THE POPULATION THROUGHOUT THE 
COUNTRY.  IT WILL RECRUIT COMPETENT AND CREDIBLE 
PROFESSIONALS TO PUBLIC SERVICE ON THE BASIS OF MERIT; 
ESTABLISH A MORE EFFECTIVE, ACCOUNTABLE, AND TRANSPARENT 
ADMINISTRATION AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT; AND IMPLEMENT 
MEASURABLE IMPROVEMENTS IN FIGHTING CORRUPTION, PROMOTING 
JUSTICE AND THE RULE OF LAW, AND PROTECTING THE HUMAN RIGHTS 
OF ALL AFGHANS. 
 
THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT WILL GIVE PRIORITY TO THE COORDINATED 
ESTABLISHMENT IN EACH PROVINCE OF FUNCTIONAL INSTITUTIONS - 
INCLUDING CIVIL ADMINISTRATION, POLICE, AND JUDICIARY. 
THESE INSTITUTIONS WILL HAVE APPROPRIATE LEGAL FRAMEWORKS 
AND APPOINTMENT PROCEDURES; TRAINED STAFF; AND ADEQUATE 
REMUNERATION, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND AUDITING CAPACITY.  THE 
GOVERNMENT WILL ESTABLISH A FISCALLY AND INSTITUTIONALLY 
SUSTAINABLE ADMINISTRATION FOR FUTURE ELECTIONS UNDER THE 
SUPERVISION OF THE AFGHANISTAN INDEPENDENT ELECTORAL 
COMMISSION. 
 
REFORMING THE JUSTICE SYSTEM WILL BE A PRIORITY FOR THE 
AFGHAN GOVERNMENT AND INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  THE AIM WILL 
BE TO ENSURE TO ALL AFGHANS EQUAL, FAIR AND TRANSPARENT 
ACCESS TO JUSTICE BASED UPON WRITTEN CODES WITH FAIR TRIALS 
AND ENFORCEABLE VERDICTS.  MEASURES WILL INCLUDE COMPLETING 
LEGISLATIVE REFORMS FOR THE PUBLIC AS WELL AS THE PRIVATE 
SECTOR; BUILDING THE CAPACITY OF JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS AND 
PERSONNEL; PROMOTING HUMAN RIGHTS AND LEGAL AWARENESS AND 
REHABILITATING JUDICIAL INFRASTRUCTURE. 
THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
REAFFIRM THEIR COMMITMENT TO THE PROTECTION AND PROMOTION OF 
RIGHTS PROVIDED FOR IN THE AFGHAN CONSTITUTION AND THE 
INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS COVENANTS AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS 
TO WHICH AFGHANISTAN IS PARTY.  WITH A VIEW TO REBUILDING 
TRUST AMONG THOSE WHOSE LIVES WERE SHATTERED BY WAR, 
REINFORCING A SHARED SENSE OF CITIZENSHIP AND A CULTURE OF 
TOLERANCE, PLURALISM, AND OBSERVANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW, THE 
AFGHAN GOVERNMENT WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY WILL IMPLEMENT [THE TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE ACTION 
PLAN FOR PEACE, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION] [A TRANSITIONAL 
JUSTICE ACTION PLAN]. 
 
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT 
 
THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY WILL PURSUE HIGH RATES OF SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC 
GROWTH WITH THE AIM OF REDUCING HUNGER, POVERTY, AND 
UNEMPLOYMENT TO ADDRESS THE ROOTS OF VIOLENT CONFLICT.  IT 
WILL PROMOTE THE ROLE AND POTENTIAL OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR, 
ALONGSIDE THOSE OF THE PUBLIC AND NON-PROFIT SECTORS; CURB 
THE NARCOTICS INDUSTRY; ENSURE MACROECONOMIC STABILITY; 
RESTORE AND PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COUNTRY'S HUMAN, 
SOCIAL, AND PHYSICAL CAPITAL, THEREBY ESTABLISHING A SOUND 
BASIS FOR A NEW GENERATION OF LEADERS AND PROFESSIONALS; 
STRENGTHEN CIVIL SOCIETY; AND COMPLETE THE REINTEGRATION OF 
RETURNEES, INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS AND EX-COMBATANTS. 
 
PUBLIC INVESTMENTS WILL BE STRUCTURED AROUND FIVE BASIC 
PRIORITIES OF THE AFGHANISTAN NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY: 
 
¶1.   AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT; 
 
¶2.   PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE; 
 
¶3.   HUMAN CAPITAL, INCLUDING HEALTH AND EDUCATION; 
 
¶4.   SOCIAL PROTECTION; AND 
¶5.   ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE AND PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT. 
 
IN EACH OF THESE AREAS, THE OBJECTIVE WILL BE TO ACHIEVE 
MEASURABLE RESULTS TOWARDS THE GOAL OF EQUITABLE ECONOMIC 
GROWTH THAT REDUCES POVERTY, EXPANDS EMPLOYMENT AND 
ENTERPRISE CREATION, ENHANCES OPPORTUNITIES IN THE REGION, 
AND IMPROVES THE WELL-BEING OF ALL AFGHANS. 
 
COUNTER-NARCOTICS - A CROSSCUTTING PRIORITY 
 
MEETING THE THREAT THAT THE NARCOTICS INDUSTRY POSES TO 
NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AS WELL AS THE 
DEVELOPMENT AND GOVERNANCE OF THE COUNTRY AND THE WELL-BEING 
OF AFGHANS WILL BE A PRIORITY FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  THE AIM WILL BE TO ACHIEVE A 
SUSTAINED AND SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE PRODUCTION AND 
TRAFFICKING OF NARCOTICS WITH A VIEW TO COMPLETE 
ELIMINATION.  ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS INCLUDE IMPROVED 
INTERDICTION, LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND JUDICIAL CAPACITY 
BUILDING; ENHANCED COOPERATION AMONG AFGHANISTAN, 
NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES, AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ON 
DISRUPTING THE DRUGS TRADE; WIDER PROVISION OF ECONOMIC 
ALTERNATIVES FOR FARMERS AND LABORERS; AND BUILDING NATIONAL 
AND PROVINCIAL COUNTER-NARCOTICS INSTITUTIONS.  IT WILL ALSO 
BE CRUCIAL TO ENFORCE A ZERO-TOLERANCE POLICY TOWARDS 
OFFICIAL CORRUPTION; TO REINFORCE THE MESSAGE THAT PRODUCING 
OR TRADING OPIATES IS BOTH IMMORAL AND A VIOLATION OF 
ISLAMIC LAW; AND TO REDUCE THE DEMAND FOR THE ILLICIT USE OF 
OPIATES WHILE PROVIDING USERS WITH MEDICAL SUPPORT. 
 
 
COORDINATION AND MONITORING MECHANISMS 
 
THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WILL 
ESTABLISH A JOINT COORDINATION AND MONITORING MECHANISM FOR 
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS COMPACT.  AS DETAILED IN ANNEX 3, 
THIS MECHANISM WILL BE CO-CHAIRED BY THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT 
AND THE UNITED NATIONS AND WILL BE SUPPORTED BY A 
SECRETARIAT.  IT WILL ENSURE GREATER COHERENCE OF EFFORTS BY 
 
SIPDIS 
THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT AND INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO 
IMPLEMENT THE COMPACT AND PROVIDE REGULAR AND TIMELY REPORTS 
ON ITS EXECUTION TO THE PRESIDENT, NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, AFGHAN 
PUBLIC, AND INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.
