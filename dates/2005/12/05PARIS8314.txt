SUBJECT: MDA: FRANCE REITERATES SUPPORT FOR DRAFT GENEVA 
PROTOCOL 
 
REF: SECSTATE 220751 
 
(SBU) If the draft Geneva protocol comes up for an urgent 
vote, France will "support its friends" and hold to its 
commitments by voting in favor, according to French MFA IO 
Desk Officer for Social and Labor Issues Sonia Dona Perez. 
She expressed concern about possible delays due to the 
reported protocolary inflexibility of Geneva authorities, 
which may prevent delegations from voting without their first 
presenting formal diplomatic notes (rather than telgraphic 
authorization).
