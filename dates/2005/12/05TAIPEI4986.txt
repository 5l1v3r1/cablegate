¶1. In the "3-in-1 local elections" on December 3 (REF A), 
the ruling DPP won city mayor/county magistrate seats in 
five cities/counties in southern Taiwan - Chiayi County, 
Tainan County (REF C), Tainan City (REF D), Kaohsiung 
County, and Pingtung County.  The KMT won in Chiayi City 
(REF B) for the first time in 23 years and kept its 
magisterial seat in Penghu County.  Taitung County (REF E) 
was won by an independent candidate who is still a KMT 
member.  This report provides bio information for the newly 
elected magistrates of Kaohsiung, Pingtung, Taitung, and 
Penghu counties. 
 
¶2.  Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing (DPP) 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
Born in 1956, Yang is the incumbent Magistrate elected in 
¶2001. 
 
Yang has a master's degree in Civil Engineering from 
National Taiwan University.  He was elected as a Provincial 
Assembly member in 1994 and as a Legislator in 1998.  Before 
became an elected official, he was a civil servant engineer 
working for both the Kaohsiung City and County Governments. 
 
Yang's strong grass roots support, including from "pan-blue" 
factions in the county, made this an easy race for him. 
 
¶3.  Pingtung County Magistrate Tsao Chi-hung (DPP) 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Born in 1948, Tsao is a former Legislator (1999-2004), 
former Provincial Assembly member (1994-98) and former 
National Assembly member (1992-94). 
 
Tsao holds a BA in Education from the Chinese Culture 
 
SIPDIS 
University, Taipei, and taught at a junior high school 
before his election to the Legislature.  As a ruling party 
legislator, Tsao felt that "changing Taiwan" could not rely 
on politicians.  Instead, he hoped that political enthusiasm 
could be transferred to improving one's community.  He has 
advocated "community development projects" to promote the 
idea of improving living environments in Taiwan. 
 
¶4.  Taitung County Magistrate Wu Chun-li (KMT) 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Born in 1962, Wu is the incumbent Speaker of Taitung County 
Council elected in 2002. 
 
Wu is a graduate of National Kaohsiung University of Applied 
Science, Kaohsiung.  He was the KMT candidate in the 2001 
magisterial election, but was defeated by former Magistrate 
Hsu. 
 
Before the election, the Ministry of Interior (MOI) declared 
Wu would be suspended from his post immediately if elected 
because he had been convicted in a corruption scandal. 
Before his recent December 20 swearing-in ceremony, the MOI 
publicly reiterated its intention.  During the December 20 
ceremony, Wu appointed his ex-wife as Deputy Magistrate to 
have her act on his behalf.  Wu divorced his wife on 
December 19 deliberately to bypass the nepotism law which 
forbids elected officials from appointing family members to 
public office. 
 
The MOI invalidated this appointment since, they argued, Wu 
had no authority to appoint subordinates since he had been 
suspended from the magistrate position.  The MOI has 
appointed Taitung County Government Secretary-general Lai 
Shun-hsien as Acting Magistrate.  There are legal questions 
regarding the MOI's actions.  Wu's supporters claim the MOI 
has no standing to invalidate Wu's swearing-in since he was 
convicted prior to his election, not after it.  Over the 
next few months, this case will be argued in court and, in 
the long run, there could be possible clarifications to the 
election law. 
 
In the near future, the MOI will have to call a by-election 
to elect a "legitimate magistrate."  If Wu runs again and 
wins his supporters claim that, according to the current 
"Local Autonomy Law," the MOI will have no further legal 
right to remove him again from the magisterial seat. 
Apparently, Wu is planning to run in the by-election.  If 
not allowed to run, Wu's ex-wife intends to run. 
 
¶5.  Penghu County - Wang Chien-fa (KMT) 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Born in 1948, Wang is the incumbent Makung City Mayor (the 
biggest city in Penghu County where half of the county's 
residents live), elected in 2002. 
 
Wang, a native of Makung City, is a graduate of National 
Open University.  Before being elected as Makung City Mayor, 
Wang served in the County Government as Director of the Tax 
Bureau and Bureau of Finance. 
 
Wang's older brother was Penghu County Magistrate from 1989 
until his death in 1992.
