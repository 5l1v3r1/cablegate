BRIEFING 
 
Ambassador Wilson's Remarks on Turkish Economy:  Monday's 
"Turkiye" quoted Ambassador Wilson as saying that "Turkey's 
economic performance has been remarkable.  No other European 
country has been this successful.  Turkey is one of the 
world's emerging markets.  This attracts not only Americans, 
but businesspeople from all around the world.  General 
Electric is preparing to invest $1.8 billion in Turkey, 
reflecting confidence in the Turkish economy and its 
future." 
 
President Sezer's Visit to Egypt:   "Milliyet" reports that 
President Sezer is in Egypt for a two-day working visit. 
Sezer and Mubarak, reportedly, will be discussing Iraq, 
Syria and Cyprus issues.  Accompanied by Foreign Minister 
Gul and State Minister Kursad Tuzmen, Sezer is expected to 
sign a free trade agreement with Egypt today to improve the 
economic relationship between the two countries. 
 
Intellectuals Demand the Annulment of Article 301:  Today's 
papers report on the joint statement released by 169 
intellectuals yesterday protesting two articles of the new 
penal code.  In the statement, the intellectuals demanded 
the annulment of articles 301 and 305. 
 
ANKARA 00007590  002 OF 003 
 
 
 
According to the intellectuals, these two articles thwart 
freedom of thought and expression.  The declaration stated 
that there has been an increase recently in the number of 
trials based on article 301. 
 
YOK Struggle Against the New Regulation for Imam-Hatip 
Graduates:  The Higher Education Board (YOK) filed a suit 
yesterday to cancel a decree making university access easier 
for graduates of Imam-Hatip schools.  "Cumhuriyet" says that 
the recent decree damages Turkey's secular system. 
 
Opening of a New American Consulate in Erbil:  "Milliyet" 
reports that US Ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad, told 
Zagros TV that the Iraqi Kurds are the US's strategic allies 
and the US is going to open a Consulate in Erbil in the very 
near future. 
 
Secretary Rice's Upcoming Visit to Turkey:  "Cumhuriyet," 
 
SIPDIS 
citing diplomatic sources, says that Secretary Rice will be 
coming to Turkey at the beginning of February to discuss 
Iran, Syria, Iraq and PKK issues.  According to same 
diplomatic sources, visiting Turkey after the CIA and FBI 
leaders, Rice will present Turkey with more concrete 
evidence on Syria and Iraq and will ask Ankara to take a 
tougher stance against the two countries. 
 
US Assistant Secretary E. Anthony Wayne's Op-ed:  The 
December 26 edition of "Sabah" carried an op-ed piece 
written by E Anthony Wayne, Assistant Secretary of State for 
Economy and Business Relations, about countering terrorism 
by cutting off terrorist financing. 
 
EDITORIAL OPINION:   US-Turkey; GWOT 
 
"Awaiting Secretary Rice" 
Yilmaz Oztuna observed in the conservative daily "Turkiye" 
(12/27):  "The visit of the FBI and CIA directors to Ankara 
received significant attention in the European press. 
Turkey now expects to host Secretary Rice in Ankara in early 
January.  She is going to engage in serious discussions with 
Turkey about regional and strategic topics, in which Turkey 
has a very important role.  During the talks with Secretary 
Rice, Ankara is expected to bring up the elimination of 
terrorist organizations, like the PKK and Armenian ASALA. 
Ankara will also ask the US to pressure the Greek Cypriots 
toward a peaceful settlement.   According to the German 
press, Secretary Rice will ask in return for Turkey's 
strategic help in a strike against Iran. Iran currently 
poses a threat against the entire western system, not only 
to the US.  Nevertheless, interestingly Iran did not accept 
the recent offer from Russia to cooperate on a uranium 
enrichment program.  The developments regarding Iran require 
close analysis and Turkey should be prepared for 
comprehensive talks with Secretary Rice." 
 
"The Decline of Bush's Popularity" 
Oral Calislar wrote in the leftist-nationalist "Cumhuriyet" 
(12/27): "Recent news from the United States clearly 
indicates that the image of Bush as a hero is gone, as he is 
losing popularity very quickly.  The occupation of Iraq did 
not bring any power and prestige for President Bush.  The 
resistance of the Iraqi people has become a main factor in 
the collapse of the image of a `powerful' war machine.  The 
partners of President Bush are currently leaving Iraq. It 
was unacceptable to begin with that the US could invade a 
country, violating international laws and justifying its 
action with lies.  The US thought that it could because it 
was so powerful. President Bush is not a trustworthy figure 
 
ANKARA 00007590  003 OF 003 
 
 
in the eyes of the American people.  The clock is tickling 
against him.  In this atmosphere, there is additional 
speculation about the possibility of an American operation 
against Iran.  If that happens, it will only bring more 
disaster.  However, President Bush might consider taking 
such an insane action in hopes of restoring his image. 
Elections are the most significant indicators in American 
politics.  Can conservative Republicans engage in insane 
acts on the eve of presidential elections?  It is very 
difficult but it is not impossible either."
