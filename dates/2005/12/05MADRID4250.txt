SUBJECT: SPAIN/IRAQ: MFA STATEMENT ON ELECTIONS 
 
REF: STATE 225860 
 
Embassy shared reftel points with MFA Subdirector General for 
Middle East Affairs Alberto Moreno on December 13.  Moreno 
expressed appreciation for the points, but was non-committal 
as to whether Spain would issue a statement on the Iraq 
elections.  The MFA did move forward, releasing a December 16 
press communique congratulating the Iraqi people on the 
elections and reconfirming Spain's commitment to assist in 
the reconstruction of Iraq.  An informal translation of the 
MFA statement follows: 
 
Begin Text: 
 
The Spanish government expresses its satisfaction regarding 
the celebration of general elections in Iraq, and 
congratulates the Iraqi people for the high participation in 
an election that has taken place in a relatively calm 
climate.  The Spanish Government also trusts that (the 
elections) will redound in the form of greater legitimacy and 
representation on the part of the Assembly and Government 
that will result from the electoral process. 
 
The Spanish government hopes that this election, a key 
element of the Iraqi political transition laid out in UNSC 
Resolution 1546, consolidates the base of a sovereign, safe, 
united, prosperous, and democratic Iraq, at peace with its 
neighbors. 
 
These elections constitute an important step in the Iraqi's 
progressive assumption of all elements of national 
sovereignty, including the maintenance of security and public 
order in the country. 
 
The Spanish Government reiterates its commitment to Iraq's 
democratization, reconstruction, stability and territorial 
integrity.
