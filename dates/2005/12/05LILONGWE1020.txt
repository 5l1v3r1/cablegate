REF: A. LILONGWE 829 B. LILONGWE 863 C. LILONGWE 1005 
 
¶1. (SBU) The Government of Malawi has submitted, via 
diplomatic 
note to the Embassy, a request for an End User, Retransfer 
and Security Assurances agreement covering four UH-1H 
helicopters.  The helicopters, tail numbers 317, 331, 360, 
and 387, are to be donated to Malawi by Taiwan.   Post has no 
objections, but requests further guidance on how to proceed. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: The helicopters, along with four 
locomotives and four patrol boats, are the latest example of 
how much Taiwan values Malawi's strong support (reftels). 
Taiwan is also funding the building of a new parliament 
building in Lilongwe, and a new road in northern Malawi.
