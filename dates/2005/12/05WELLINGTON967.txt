SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND RESPONSE FOR SUPPORT OF PARTNERSHIPS 
TO REDUCE MERCURY POLLUTION 
 
REF: SECSTATE 218928 
 
¶1.  Poloff on December 6 provided reftel demarche points to 
Lesley Woudberg, Senior Advisor, Environment Division, NZ 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT).  On December 
13, Woudberg responded that GNZ is following the UN 
Environment Program (UNEP) 2005 decision on mercury closely 
and is interested in seeing how effective a partnership 
approach will be, believing approaches other than an 
international agreement are likely to be most effective. 
However, she said that New Zealand is not in a position to 
actively pursue partnerships, and GNZ does not see mercury as 
a high priority for New Zealand at this time. 
 
¶2.  Woudberg said that New Zealand faces low risk of mercury 
from human sources, noting that New Zealand does not have 
chlor-alkali facilities, or artisanal and small-scale gold 
mining that use mercury.  There is relatively little coal 
combustion in New Zealand.  In order to meet its Kyoto 
obligations, New Zealand has recently introduced new air 
quality standards.  While these do not specifically target 
mercury, they will reduce mercury produced by coal 
combustion.  Woudberg also noted low external risk, 
indicating that New Zealand has no large scale, "up wind" 
producers, and that circulation patterns in the Southern 
Hemisphere do not appear to have the same concentrating 
effects as those in the Northern Hemisphere. 
 
¶3.  While noting that the level of risk from human sources is 
low, Woudberg indicated that New Zealand does have a 
"relatively high level" mercury problem.  She indicated that 
these mercury levels are naturally-occurring and stem from 
volcanic activity.  As a result, GNZ has standards related to 
the mercury levels in fish, for example.
