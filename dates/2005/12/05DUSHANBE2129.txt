SUBJECT: TAJIK MEDIA NAMES RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR "DIPLOMAT OF THE YEAR" 
 
 
¶1.  A New Year's tradition, Tajikistan's electronic news agency 
"Asia Plus" and Russian-language independent paper "Kurier 
Tajikistana" published best of the year lists, sourced from 
editors' personal opinions and popularity polls, and the 
diplomatic community wasn't left out of their end of the year 
analysis.  "Asia Plus" ranked Russian Ambassador Ramazan 
Abdulatipov as "Diplomat of the Year."  In "Kurier Tajikistana," 
Abdulatipov edged out Ambassador Hoagland 16 - 7 for "Most 
Active Diplomat." 
 
¶2.  "Asia Plus," published a lengthy section on Abdulatipov that 
praises him for being the first Muslim Russian Ambassador to 
Tajikistan as well as a famous scientist and statesman.  He was 
also lauded for his "zealous work in Tajikistan that 
overshadowed his colleague, Ambassador Hoagland." 
 
¶3.  (SBU) COMMENT.  The Tajik mass media is ever quick to pit 
the United States against Russia on all manner of issues.  This 
is not always negative, however, as papers, editors, and issues 
swing between the two camps, keeping readers engaged in what the 
two countries are doing in Tajikistan.  The influence of Russian 
media organs, the Tajik State-owned press, and cautious 
self-censorship continue to remain an issue with free 
independent press in Tajikistan, but moments of open criticism, 
genuine reporting, and free expression have been, and continue 
to be, present.  END COMMENT.
