BRIEFING 
 
Government Opens the University Doors to Imam-Hatip 
Students:  All papers cover extensively the news about a 
regulatory change that allows Imam-Hatip (Islamic schools) 
graduates to enter any university they want by completing 
the necessary courses in the correspondence ("open") high 
school system.  "Hurriyet" reports that the Higher Education 
Board (YOK) announced that they will be applying to the 
court for the regulation to be annulled. 
 
Tense Budget Debates at the Parliament:  During 
parliamentary debates yesterday on next year's budget, 
opposition parties harshly criticized the Government for its 
domestic and foreign policies.  "Sabah" says CHP leader 
Deniz Baykal criticized the Prime Minister mainly for his 
comments related to the Turkish national identity, saying 
that `Turkey has no such problems'. 
 
Rector Askin Trial:  Today's papers give extensive coverage 
to the trial of Van University Rector Prof. Yucel Askin for 
irregularities in the university hospital.  "Sabah" reports 
that the previous judge who had objected to Askin's jail 
sentence was replaced with a new judge.  The trial lasted 
 
ANKARA 00007359  002 OF 003 
 
 
for six hours and the court rejected the prosecutors request 
for Askin's release.  The trial was postponed to December 29 
due to the need to hear other defendants. 
 
General Buyukanit Comments:  Turkish Land Forces Commander 
General Buyukanit described his visit to the US as extremely 
positive.  Buyukanit said that there were some news reports 
claiming that he came to the US to get some form of 
approval.  He responded that the Turkish Military gets its 
authorization only from Ataturk and from laws.  He added 
that this is only a routine visit and such visits are paid 
to many countries. 
 
Pentagon Bribes Media for Pro-American news:  All papers 
report on the Pentagon information program first reported on 
by "USA Today." Several papers claim that the US has 
allocated $400 million to be paid to pro-American 
journalists for their articles.  "Zaman" says that this 
money is to be used as a psychological warfare tactic by the 
US. 
 
The US Prepares to Strike Iran:  "Cumhuriyet" reports on its 
front page that US is stocking fuel oil for jets brought to 
Iskenderun airport in October and November.  The paper 
claims that the US is getting ready to strike Iran. 
 
Barzani and Talabani Remarks: In remarks attributed to 
Barzani in "Aksam" and Talabani in "Yeni Safak," Iraqi 
officials requested a general amnesty from Turkey for the 
PKK militants in the mountains.  Barzani reportedly said 
that this is the only solution for the PKK issue. 
EDITORIAL OPINION: IRAQ ELECTIONS 
 
"Democracy vs. Anti-Democracy" 
Hasan Cemal observed in the mainstream "Milliyet" (12/15): 
"The main issue in the Iraq elections is the battle between 
those who are for democracy and those who are against it. 
This time Sunni participation is even more important than 
before because it directly links to the legitimacy of the 
elections and Iraq's stability. There is also some 
speculation and concern regarding the possibility of an 
emergence of an Islamic dictatorship in Iraq right after the 
demise of the Saddam Hussein dictatorship.  In any case, 
this is a very important day for Iraq.  Elections can either 
pave the way for stability and democracy or cause chaos and 
division.  Let's hope for the first possibility as this also 
has important consequences for Turkey." 
 
"The Iraqi Election Also Draws Turkey's Destiny" 
Cuneyt Ulsever commented in the mass appeal "Hurriyet" 
(12/15): "There are two facts which cannot be changed: the 
US has clearly failed to bring peace and order to Iraq; and 
tmore effort is made every day in the US to bring the Iraq 
war to an end. The US is aware of the fact that it will have 
to pull out from Iraq gradually.  However a US withdrawal 
without any back up is going to create nothing but chaos in 
Iraq.  In the meantime, the US has some other business on 
the agenda, like Syria and Iran. At this point, there is no 
way for the US to achieve a UN mandate for their future 
efforts.  Therefore the US is trying to build bilateral or 
regional support.  Turkey is on the top of this list, and 
that gives Turkey a valuable card to play." 
 
"Iraq is a Turning Point Not Only for the Mideast, But also 
for Turkey and the US" 
Cengiz Candar wrote in the tabloid "Bugun" (12/15): "The 
election in Iraq is the most important event of 2005 in 
world politics.  Currently Iraq is at the center of world 
politics and events there directly or indirectly concern 
 
ANKARA 00007359  003 OF 003 
 
 
every country on the globe.  The result of the elections 
will shape the future destiny of the Middle East with both 
regional and global impact.   The election is, of course, 
very important for Turkey as well. Given the current 
situation in Iraq, unity can still emerge after the 
elections.  This possibility, despite all the setbacks, is 
becoming stronger than the possibility of a divided Iraq."
