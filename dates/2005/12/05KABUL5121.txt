SUBJECT: TWO SCHOOLS ATTACKED IN HELMAND 
 
REF: KABUL 5038 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  A TEACHER WAS KILLED ON DECEMBER 16 IN NAD ALI 
DISTRICT IN HELMAND PROVINCE.  ALTHOUGH THE MOTIVE WAS 
UNCLEAR, TERRORISM IS LIKELY.  ON DECEMBER 17, ANOTHER 
INCIDENT INVOLVING A SCHOOL TOOK PLACE, THIS TIME IN THE 
PROVINCIAL CAPITAL.  TWO MEN ON A MOTORCYCLE DROVE TO THE 
KARTELEGON SCHOOL IN LASHKAR GAH, WALKED INTO THE SCHOOL, AND 
SHOT AND KILLED A MALE STUDENT AND A JANITOR.  THEY THEN FLED 
ON THE MOTORCYCLE. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  PRT LASHKAR GAH BELIEVES THESE ACTIONS WERE LIKELY 
INTENDED TO DISRUPT THE ARRIVAL OF HELMAND'S NEW GOVERNOR, 
ENGINEER DAUD (REFTEL), AND THAT TERRORISTS TOOK ADVANTAGE OF 
THE WEAKNESS OF LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT.  AS A RESULT OF THESE 
INCIDENTS, ENGINEER DAUD CONVENED AN EMERGENCY EVENING 
SECURITY COUNCIL MEETING WITH HELMAND LAW ENFORCEMENT 
OFFICIALS.  HE DIRECTED ADDITIONAL SECURITY MEASURES TO 
COUNTER THESE ATTACKS, AND TOOK A VERY STERN POSITION WITH 
HIS POLICE CHIEF: EITHER TAKE CHARGE OR SOMEONE ELSE WILL BE 
TAKING OVER YOUR JOB.
