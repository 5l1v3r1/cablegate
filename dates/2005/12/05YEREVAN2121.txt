(SBU) On December 8, the Armenian National Assembly 
voted to extend Armenia's deployment of a non-combat 
contingent to Iraq for an additional year.  In contrast 
to last December's original authorization, opposition 
parties who are boycotting the National Assembly did 
not return to vote (reftel).  Most of the pro- 
government coalition (with the exception of the 
Dashnaks) and non-aligned members, voted to extend the 
contingent's mandate, and it cleared the National 
Assembly by a vote of 73 for to 12 against, with one 
abstention.  (Note:  The resolution needed a simple 
majority of 66 votes to pass the National Assembly. 
End Note.)
