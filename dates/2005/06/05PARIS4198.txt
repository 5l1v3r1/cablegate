START MEMO NOM-POST-OBJ: 
Our principal objective is to strengthen our contact with a 
potential high-level civil servant in the French government 
trade bureaucracy and help him better understand the US 
position on key economic issues.  We expect that in the near 
future we will continue to deal with Mr. Saintoyant in his new 
post. In the more distant future he is likely to become a more 
influential player on the whole range of US-EU trade issues. 
By having him visit the United States for the first time early 
in his career and via this program, we will solidify Mr. 
Santoyant's appreciation for the importance of Franco-American 
cooperation on trade relations and his understanding of the 
extensive common interests shared by the US and France on 
trade liberalization. 
END MEMO NOM-POST-OBJ: 
START MEMO NOM-POST-RCMD: 
Mr. Saintoyant would be an excellent participant in the 
project "Trade and Economic Development."  This subject is at 
the center of European and French thinking on how to maintain 
forward momentum in multilateral trade negotiations, since the 
commitment of developing countries to trade liberalization is 
essential to the success of future WTO negotiations.  The 
French finance ministry's trade directorate is the source of 
some of the most creative thinking in Europe on this topic. 
Mr. Saintoyant could provide valuable insights on how free 
trade can help spark economic growth in developing countries, 
while also offering a sophisticated presentation of the limits 
of trade liberalization in dealing with world poverty.

START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Saintoyant's past experience and future prospects make him an 
ideal candidate for the IV Program. After graduating from the 
prestigious Ecole Nationale d'Administration, a college for 
future high-level civil servants, he was hired to his current 
position at the Ministry of Economics and Finance. This billet 
is a very sensitive one for American interests as is 
demonstrated by the fact that this job put him in charge of 
handling international negotiations pertaining to agriculture 
and development issues. He is a desirable candidate for this 
program because the issues he is in charge of are crucial to 
ongoing and future US trade policy objectives including, for 
example, WTO Doha Round and relations with developing 
countries. To take part in the IV Program would ideally make 
him more sympathetic to, or at least more understanding of, 
U.S. positions on such issues. Furthermore, since he is in 
charge of negotiations and other issues important to the U.S., 
what he learns and experiences via this program will be passed 
on to those in his chain of command, both upward as well as 
downward. 
Evidence of the fact that such an experience could make the 
French Ministry of Economics and Finance more amiable to U.S. 
interests is the testimony of the U.S. Embassy Trade Officer 
who has had contact with him for two years. This officer 
considers Saintoyant to be more open to external views than 
many other French officers in this trade directorate. He 
appears to be sensitive to new ideas and recognizes the 
importance of not evaluating issues through a protectionist, 
nationalistic lens. Providing him with further American 
acquaintances and an on-the-ground view of how the U.S. works 
could markedly broaden this potential high-level negotiator's 
worldview in a direction sympathetic to the U.S. 
Saintoyant will soon take a new position in the Ministry of 
Economics and Finance. A recent reorganization of this 
ministry has opened several positions that would allow him to 
exercise further influence in roles dealing with international 
trade as well as international finance issues. As an example 
of how influential these new positions are, one of the options 
would have him working for the preparation of G8 meetings. In 
the next 10 years, Saintoyant will almost certainly occupy a 
more senior position at the Ministry of Economics and Finance 
or overseas. It is even feasible that he will serve as an 
advisor to a French minister. In any case, his current role is 
vital enough that this program would, through him, make the 
Ministry of Economics and Finance more understanding of U.S. 
concerns.
