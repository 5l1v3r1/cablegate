Â¶1. (U) Pol/Econ delivered demarche per reftel 2 June to 
Director of Bilateral Relations, Mohamed Ali Hassan. Hassan 
stated that while Djibouti appreciates the U.S. requesting 
assistance on its neighbor's behalf and explaining why it 
will be supporting a particular candidate, it has a hard time 
supporting a country that does not approach Djibouti directly 
for assistance. He continued that if a country was looking to 
be elected to a seat in an organization, it should approach 
its fellow members first, before another member approached 
others on its behalf. Hassan said that Djibouti sees great 
value in partnerships and would welcome an approach by 
Barbados, but without knowing the objectives and goals of 
Barbados first-hand it would be difficult to lend its 
support.
