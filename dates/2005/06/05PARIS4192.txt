It has always been a goal to reach out to the minority and 
immigrant communities in France. Since 9/11, the importance of 
reaching out to the Muslim community in particular has also 
become a top priority. Naima Charai is one of the few 
immigrant women elected officials in France and does not 
manifest any strong a-priori anti-U.S. bias. Her main areas of 
concern, social and urban problems, are ones that both our 
countries devote enormous efforts and resources to, although 
pursuing somewhat different approaches. An IV program for 
Charai, who has never been to the U.S., would offer the 
possibility of creating a strong, favorable impression in 
someone who has a profile that we do not often run across and 
who has the energy and drive to be present on the political 
scene for many years to come.

START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
The Regional Council of Aquitaine covers five departments and 
is the third largest in France. It has a budget of some 700 
million Euros with  broad responsibilities in the areas of 
economic development, education, infrastructure, and 
transportation. There are 85 elected members of the Council. 
Naima Charai is an exception in France: young (32), female, 
from an immigrant family of 10 children whose parents are 
illiterate, and an elected official (put in an electable 
position on the PS electoral list in March 2004). By any 
standards she is a classic success story. From doing a 
secondary program in sewing and styling, through an individual 
effort she was able to re-orient herself and attain 
undergraduate degrees in psychology and then go on to two 
graduate degrees in the same field. 
Early on Charai became involved in association and 
humanitarian work. She has worked with Medecins du Monde to 
facilitate access to health care for 16-25 year-olds who are 
in precarious circumstances and also with young drug addicts. 
Starting in 2000 she became involved with prostitution issues 
and founded an organization to promote access to health care 
for these young women (and sometimes men) from Eastern Europe 
and Africa, as well as making them aware of their fundamental 
rights. 
The same drive and profile that brought her to the attention 
of local politicians made the APP aware of her activities. I 
had first met her several times when she was sent by the 
Regional Council to represent it at various events. Although 
on the Left politically, she is not dogmatic in her attitude 
toward the United States and is genuinely interested in 
learning more about American approaches to social and urban 
problems. Although not a practicing Muslim, she comes from 
that community and offers an unusual opportunity to make 
connections with someone who has made extraordinary strides 
herself and is likely to be an increasingly important 
interlocutor for the future.

Based on the USG's current efforts to reach out to new 
audiences and especially to the Arab-Muslim community, an IV 
project for Mr. Boumahdi would be a chance for the USG to have 
a significant impact on an influential point of contact for 
the Mission in the Toulouse area. Having never visited the 
U.S. and coming from an environment where negative sentiments 
towards the U.S. tend to prevail, this is an outstanding 
opportunity to influence Mr. Boumahdi's perceptions of 
American religious culture and policy towards minorities. As a 
Muslim leader, his exposure to religious issues in the United 
States would very likely help counter many misconceptions 
present in the minds of French Muslims due to their current 
distrust of the United States based on their perception that 
the U.S. are waging a war against Islam. Providing him with a 
direct understanding of American values and efforts to fight 
discrimination will enable Mr. Boumahdi to gain a realistic 
knowledge and perception of the United States. Through Mr. 
Boumahdi, the USG can correct misunderstandings about 
America's attitude towards religious and ethnic minorities. 
END MEMO NOM-POST-OBJ: 
START MEMO NOM-POST-RCMD: 
Having never been to the United States, Mr. Boumahdi is eager 
to learn about the U.S. affirmative action policy (its roots, 
consequences, and results according to key players in the 
field). He is more specifically interested in discrimination 
in the job market and would like to meet with non-profits that 
deal with discrimination and job integration. He is also 
interested in meeting with Muslim leaders as well as with 
other minority leaders (Hispanic, African-American, religious 
minorities). He would like to better understand the way 
American Muslims live and the issues they face, in particular 
how they practice their faith and what attitude Muslims in 
other parts of the world should adopt towards America and 
towards American Muslims. He is also keen to see if Muslims 
outside of the U.S. can benefit from American Muslims' 
experience with social integration (before and after 9/11), 
religious tolerance, and secularism.

NOMINATING-OFFICER: Helene Mason 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Through his professional and personal interests, Rachid 
Boumahdi is a key player in Toulouse with regard to the many 
issues facing Muslim and immigrant communities. A native of 
Algeria himself, Mr. Boumahdi arrived in France in 1989 to 
pursue his post-graduate studies at the Toulouse University of 
Social Sciences thanks to a scholarship awarded to him by the 
Algerian Ministry of Higher Education as valedictorian of his 
class at the University of Algiers. His subsequent research in 
the field of economics has focused in part on discrimination 
in the job market in France and abroad. He has already 
published articles on this theme and is keenly interested in 
the current debate on affirmative action taking place in 
France. A deeper understanding of the roots and effects of 
affirmative action in the United States would likely impact 
his contribution to the French scientific community's debate 
on this issue. As a university lecturer currently responsible 
for teaching economics to approximately 500 students at 
various undergraduate and post-graduate levels and as a likely 
future tenured professor, he may also have the opportunity to 
teach on this theme to a number of students. 
With respect to his personal involvement with the Muslim 
community, Mr. Boumahdi is highly regarded as a moderate 
preacher and is one of three main local Islamic leaders for a 
community of approximately 30,000 Muslims in Toulouse. He has 
led prayer meetings -both in French and Arabic- twice a day, 
and the Friday prayers in particular, for the past five years 
at a cultural center in Portet-sur-Garonne, a close Toulouse 
suburbs. There are only approximately eight places of worship 
for Muslims in the greater Toulouse area. As one of the few 
Muslim preachers in Toulouse, Mr. Boumahdi is a member of the 
"Muslim Coordination" group, which brings together the main 
Toulouse Imams on a monthly basis to discuss issues and 
exchange ideas. He embodies the emergence of a new Muslim 
elite in Toulouse and has actively worked in favor of an Islam 
disconnected from foreign countries' influence, thus 
redefining the place of Islam and its organization in 
Toulouse. 
Mr. Boumahdi is also involved with the Institute of Science 
and Theology of Religions (ISTR) through which he teaches a 
course on Islam every trimester to a total of approximately 
100 students from the Nursing School, Toulouse Business School 
and the National School for Civil Aviation. Until 2003, he was 
also involved in the ISTR inter-faith Advisory Board along 
with a number of other religious leaders and experts in 
Toulouse. 
Through his various connections, Mr. Boumahdi's network puts 
him on the forefront of the Toulouse Muslim life. His advice 
is sought-after by his peers and his influence in the Muslim 
community is great, despite his refusal to take part in the 
regional chapter of the French Council on the Muslim Faith. 
Mr. Boumahdi's open-mindedness also sets him apart and 
warrants a beneficial, if not influential, IV visit. He will 
no doubt become a university professor, with the added 
credibility and influence that this position entails, and has 
every intention of continuing to be an active leader in the 
Toulouse Muslim community. 
Not only would a visit to the United States as an 
International Visitor certainly influence Mr. Boumahdi's 
vision of religious issues in the U.S., it would also enable 
APP Toulouse to establish links with the local Muslim 
community. Such connections are difficult to develop, 
especially in the current international political situation, 
and this would be an effective opportunity to facilitate and 
amplify our outreach to the Muslim community.

Amar Dib is a sociologist who occupies a series of concurrent 
positions, all tied to immigration and integration issues. 
Responsible for the Early Prevention Unit of the greater Lyon 
urban community, Dib also is an Administrator of the FASILD 
(Special Action and Support Fund for Integration and Anti- 
Discrimination), a national agency that supports some 6,000 
institutions nationwide. In 2002, Dib was appointed a member 
of the National Economic and Social Advisory Council. Dib also 
is the Publishing Director of SADMagazine, a monthly national 
magazine that targets Muslim readers and covers social, 
economic and cultural issues. Dib is close to J-L Borloo, the 
Minister of Labor and Social Cohesion, who recently tasked Dib 
with recommending new policies to facilitate the integration 
of immigrants. Borloo asked Dib to place a special focus on 
affirmative action in his report. Dib is the author of several 
reports on integration policies, including one on housing and 
ethnic pluralism that was ordered by the Presidency. He also 
produced a study on Islam and integration. Dib is the national 
president and co-founder of Club Convergence, a national 
network, which gathers some 5,000 intellectuals and upper 
class French Arabs. Club Convergences has two primary goals: 
not only to serve as role models for young Arabs in France, 
but also to serve as "evidence" (to the French authorities) 
that French Arabs can serve in positions of responsibility in 
numerous different fields. In addition, Dib participates in 
numerous outreach programs, seminars and other events 
throughout the country. 
Dib is expected to pursue an active career that will keep him 
close to the highest national political and media circles. As 
a prolific author and active network lobbyist he should also 
remain an influential relay for new ideas.

One of our primary tasks is to reach out to the media in order 
to achieve balanced and fair coverage of U.S. policies, goals 
and values. It is vital to include major local media in this 
strategy. For Southwestern France, Sud-Ouest is the major 
player and Beziat is one of its rising young stars. He is now 
at a point in his career where he will be taking on increasing 
responsibilities. A more knowledgeable understanding of the 
U.S. as the result of an IV program will have a positive, long- 
term impact.

START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Sud-Ouest is privately held, belonging primarily to the 
founding Lemoine family. With an audience of 300-350,000, it 
is the leading regional newspaper in the area, and the second 
regional daily after Ouest-France. It covers Aquitaine, 
Charentes and Gers, and owns local dailies in Pyrenees 
Atlantiques, Charentes and Dordogne. Sud-Ouest also owns 50% 
of the Bordeaux based local TV station TV7 and operates a 
brand new, highly automated printing plant which Ambassador 
Leach visited in 2003. 
Bruno Beziat has been a journalist with Sud-Ouest for the past 
10 years. He served outside of Bordeaux in smaller cities 
before being called back to the main office in 2000 to oversee 
local Bordeaux coverage and the CUB (Communaute Urbaine de 
Bordeaux). He was recently promoted to head up the newspaper's 
social and daily life coverage, including the key sector of 
education. Beziat's original training is not specifically as a 
journalist, but rather in sociology, 
information/communication, and political science, all in 
Bordeaux, so he is very much a local product. 
Even though Beziat has had some limited exposure to the United 
States, from a high school trip and from brief visits to the 
U.S. when he worked for a weekly in Saskatchewan, Canada, this 
was more than 10 years ago. He understands, as does his senior 
management, that he would definitely benefit from exposure to 
U.S. issues, problems, and approaches today. We have been told 
by Sud-Ouest's managing editor that Beziat is being groomed 
for increased responsibilities at their publishing group and 
they are making a calculated investment in him. We can see why 
since he is a dynamic and resourceful individual. 
It is well-known that there has been considerable criticism of 
and even hostility towards the U.S. in the French media in 
recent years. This has not been the case of Sud-Ouest, which 
presented balanced coverage, for example, of the American 
presidential campaign and has been judicious in its coverage 
of the Iraq war. Discussions with Beziat have indicated that 
he is open-minded about the United States and curious about 
developments there. Selection as an IV would result in many 
years of more informed and sympathetic coverage of the U.S. at 
a major regional press outlet.

Adji Ahoudian has demonstrated a clear grasp of the difficult 
issues that confront underprivileged youth in France and has 
shown his dedication to providing a better life for the 
residents of his neighborhood. We believe a greater 
understanding of how these issues have been dealt with in the 
U.S., and the possibility of associating his goals and 
objectives with those of US support organizations for 
youth/minorities, will bolster the work of BGA within the 19th 
arrondissement.  A deeper understanding of U.S. government, 
society and culture will also permit him to act as a third 
party endorser of our policies and enhance his own active role 
as a minority community leader.

START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Actively involved in Paris' social arena, Mr. Adji Ahoudian, a 
young (25 years old) French of African origin leading a 
neighborhood association for young immigrants (Braves Garcons 
d'Afrique - Brave Boys of Africa), presents very high 
potential in terms of outreach towards a multi-ethnic and 
underprivileged community.  Born in Burkina Faso, Mr. Ahoudian 
came to France at the age of 2.  His early experiences and 
drive lead him to found  "BGA", which is now a key local actor 
for the integration of ethnic minorities in Paris' 19th 
District.  His group has been active in fostering projects, 
especially in the artistic arena, aimed at building solidarity 
among resident youth of mostly African extraction and at 
providing a creative and peaceful alternative to a lifestyle 
of violence (of national and international scope). In so 
doing, the BGA expects to also facilitate their integration 
into French society.  Mr. Ahoudian has never traveled to the 
U.S. but shows great cultural and artistic (dance & music in 
particular) interest in America, especially the African- 
American and immigrant community experience. 
Adji Ahoudian's work with underprivileged youth in his own 
neighborhood would greatly benefit from a trip to the United 
States.  He would greatly benefit from exposure to social and 
cultural community work aimed at integrating minorities and 
immigrants within the U.S. and build his own network of 
contacts for future development of local and national 
projects.  This experience would also provide him with a 
strong insight to U.S. values and society, leading to an 
increased support for U.S. policy positions for himself and 
the individuals he deals with on a regular basis and for whom 
he represents an alternative leadership.

It is important for Dr. Chelini-Pont to have exposure to both 
American notions of the separation between Church and State 
and also the central role that religion plays in American 
life. It would be useful for her to meet religious leaders 
within their communities (priests, ministers, rabbis, and 
imams) to observe the ways in which organized faith can 
interact with democracy. She should speak to someone in the 
government who can describe faith-based approaches to societal 
problems. She should also visit with professors of theology, 
universities with religious affiliations and centers of 
ecumenical activity on campus (for example: the Neuman Club at 
the University of California in Berkeley).

START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Long before religious pluralism and its 
confrontation/collision with the state became a hot issue in 
France, University Professor, Blandine Chelini-Pont designed 
two curricula on "Religion and Democracy" and "Secularism and 
Education" that received the Ministry of Education's 
accreditation: She has been teaching these courses for six 
years at the graduate level at the Marseille Law School and at 
the School of Political Science, the only institutions in 
France of higher learning where such curriculum is being 
offered. 
At age 39, a mother of five children, Dr Chelini-Pont is 
brilliant but modest. She admits to many sleepless nights 
while securing her reputation as a prolific author, and sought- 
after speaker on matters of religion, ethics, politics and 
culture. Her expertise on the history of religion and its 
interaction within the public sector, as well as her recent 
research on religious identity and the role of Islam in France 
prompted a special consultant's assignment at the Council of 
Europe. She also is a regular guest speaker for the Committee 
on "Religion and Politics" at the Quai d'Orsay. Last year, she 
was named special consultant within the Academy of 
Aix/Marseille (the representation of the Ministry of Education 
in the region) for the period 2004-2006 where she will conduct 
a seminar for all the directors of regional high schools on 
"education and secularism". 
After the publication of her sixth book in 2005 "Dieu, la 
France et les Etats-Unis: quand les mythes font la loi", she 
hopes to introduce aspects of U.S. studies into the curriculum 
at Marseille Law school. An invitation to the U.S. would be 
very timely as it would give her first hand exposure to the 
intellectual climate in which American religious thought and 
practice have influenced and been influenced by the 
development of American democracy. So far, she has only gone 
twice to the U.S. for research at libraries, it would be 
beneficial to expose her to a multi-disciplinary approach 
where she would meet with American government officials, NGOs, 
lawyers, minority groups, religious leaders, and of course 
other academics.
