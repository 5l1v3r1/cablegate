Embassy transmitted reftel note verbale on June 3 to MFA 
Director for Consular Affairs and Assistance Miguel Angel de 
Frutos Gomez.  Poloff followed up with Javier Suarez of the 
Office of Consular Affairs to convey USG interest in Mr. 
Henriquez' case and our desire to see him resettled as 
swiftly as possible.  Suarez was aware of the case through 
information received from the Ministry of Interior's Asylum 
Office, which had received an asylum application from Mr. 
Henriquez' Spanish attorney, Ariel Fraga.  Suarez said the 
USG note verbale would initiate a GOS interagency process to 
determine whether Mr. Henriquez would be likely to be 
approved for asylum if he were permitted entry into Spain. 
Post will track this case and report developments as 
necessary.
