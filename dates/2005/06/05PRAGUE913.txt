(SBU) Embassy passed reftel points to Czech MFA on June 9. 
On June 16, Mr. Pavel Caban, from the MFA Department of 
International Law indicated that the GOCR had expressed to 
the Swiss government their support for the October 2005 
Conference and the Third Additional Protocol.  Mr. Caban also 
noted that the Czech's general attitude regarding this issue 
remains the same as it was in 2000.  However, Mr. Caban 
advised us that if and when the conference takes place, a 
formal GOCR position will need to be developed and approved 
at the cabinet level, and that this would be coordinated with 
the Czech's EU partners.
