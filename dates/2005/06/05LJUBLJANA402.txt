Â¶1.  (SBU) Pol-Miloff delivered reftel demarche to MFA Legal 
Department staffer Ondina Blokar on 15 June.  Blokar said 
that an interministerial working group on international human 
rights law issues had been requested to issue an opinion on 
the Swiss Circular Note and the Third Additional Protocol. 
While the opinion has not yet been issued, Blokar said the 
GoS would likely have "no problem" with the proposal.  She 
referred to a May 2005 EU committee meeting in Brussels at 
which EU member states discussed "doing something similar" 
with respect to the Swiss Circular Note, i.e. asking other 
countries for the broadest possible support.  Blokar stressed 
that Slovenia has been a strong supporter of the ICRC and 
would continue to support international humanitarian causes 
in the future.
