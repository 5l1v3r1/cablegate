SUBJECT: CANADA'S RESPONSE TO DEMARCHE ON CHALLENGING OTHER 
DONORS TO FIGHT HUNGER AND ADDRESS HUMANITARIAN NEEDS IN 
AFRICA. 
 
REF: SECSTATE 108008 
 
Charge John Dickson discussed reftel demarche with David 
Malone, Assistant Deputy Minister for GlobalIssues at 
Foreign Affairs Canada.  Malone welcomed the information and 
responded that although the GOC is not in a position at 
the moment to make additional commitments right now, he 
expects they will have the "flexibility" to have something 
for Gleneagles.  Note:  Malone was referring to PM Paul 
Martin's minority government current management of their 
budget, maneuvering budget bills through a series of 
knife-edge votes.  A bill that will boost foreign aid 
spending is currently being contentiously debated in the 
House Finance Committee. Although the legislation is expected 
to pass, the GOC cannot count on the additional funding yet. 
End note.
