GUIDANCE 
 
 
¶1.  This is an action request. 
 
¶2.  For the upcoming 172nd Executive Board in September, 
Mission would like guidance on the following two questions: 
 
a. Should the United States present its candidacy for the 
group I seat as Executive Board vice chair? 
 
b.  Should the United States respond to a request from the 
Chair of the Executive Board requesting letters of 
nomination for the Director General position?  This would be 
the opportunity for the USG to officially go on the record 
with its support of DG Matsuura.  Any letter must be 
submitted by late July.
