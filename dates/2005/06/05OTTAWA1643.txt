START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Adrienne Batra leads the Manitoba branch of the Canadian 
Taxpayers Federation, a federally incorporated, non-profit, 
non-partisan, organization that describes itself as a 
watchdog on government.  Ms. Batra has consistently been a 
high-achiever throughout her adult life, whether in college 
where she completed her college degree while serving as a 
Lieutenant in the Canadian Armed Forces - and being elected 
VP Academic to the University of Saskatchewan Students' 
Union - or in her current position where she maintains a 
high public profile through her well-researched columns and 
serving as a frequent guest host of Manitoba's most-listened 
to call-in radio show, Adler On Line.  Although Ms. Batra is 
clearly thriving in her current environment, Post expects 
that she will continue to rise through the expanding network 
of pro-trade and free enterprise NGOs in Canada and one day 
will likely run for elected office.  Ms. Batra is an avid 
free-trader and is favorably disposed to the United States, 
despite relatively limited exposure to the country and its 
people.  More extensive exposure to the country through an 
IVLP would help to further shape her perceptions of the 
United States and put some 'meat on the bones' of the 
positive conceptions she already holds.  Batra will share 
her  experiences in the United States via media appearances 
when she returns, as well as through her leadership 
position.
