(SBU) 1. Charge delivered reftel demarche to Assistant Deputy 
Minister for Global Issues David Malone June 16.  Malone 
thanked us for the points and for earlier discussions which 
he held with IO A/S.  Malone said he believes we are in synch 
with the majority of issues related to UN reform and looks 
forward to continuing the dialogue and continuing to work the 
issue in close coordination.  This is something that matters 
to Canada and Malone said the GOC is pleased that the US is 
so focused on it as well.  He noted press reports of a change 
in US policy regarding Security Council reform, and expressed 
the unrelated concern that Security Council reform and 
"Kofigate" are overshadowing all else in the UN reform 
agenda.  He said he had hoped that SC reform would have been 
disposed of before now and worries that it will cloud the 
upcoming summit.  He expressed concern about the AU 
disconnect on a possible SC seat and how this has agitated 
China.  India and Brazil he believes are taking a more 
mature, and helpful approach.  Germany will use the issue to 
help with upcoming elections, and Japan is under tremendous 
popular pressure to deliver. 
 
Â¶2. (SBU) Malone also said he enjoyed the opportunity to 
exchange views with Senator Mitchell and Ambassador Ward and 
said that these talks were very helpful and very appreciated. 
 He believes the Mitchell report could be the Washington 
baseline for UN reform and is pleased that so much of it is 
in line with Canada's thinking.  Malone said Ottawa shares 
the Administration's concerns with the Hyde Amendment, and 
while he recognizes the limitations of a government on the 
Hill, if there is anything Canada could do to be helpful he 
hopes we will so inform him.
