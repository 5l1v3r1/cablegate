START MEMO NOM-POST-OBJ: 
Given the still centralized nature of the French Republican 
system, candidates from the ENM are essential to our efforts 
to reach out to their judicial sector. There is no better way 
to achieve results in familiarizing French magistrates with 
American approaches to legal and judicial concerns. Judge 
Bouroz is an exceptional candidate. He has had no real 
contacts with the United States and very interested in 
learning more about the American system. His position over the 
next few years and for the rest of his career offers a unique 
opportunity to create a positive long-term relationship and 
interlocutor. 
END MEMO NOM-POST-OBJ: 
START MEMO NOM-POST-RCMD: 
The nominee has some English, but is not sufficiently 
confident to be able to undertake an English-only program. In 
any case neither of the European regional programs dealing 
with trafficking in persons or international crime fall 
particularly within his areas of expertise. A program focused 
more on social issues with a strong legal/judicial component 
would seem most appropriate.

NOMINATING-OFFICER: J. Brinton Rowdybush 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
The National School for Magistrates (ENM) is located in 
Bordeaux and is the sole institution for the training of 
judges in France. After a rigorous selection process for 
admission, the students undergo an intense program and a stage 
in preparation for their responsibilities in the judicial 
system. Later in their careers some of the most promising 
judges are brought back under a three-year renewable agreement 
to teach the next generation of magistrates. 
Alexis Bouroz is a rising young magistrate who recently joined 
the faculty at ENM. He is responsible for courses dealing with 
penal (prosecutorial) issues. He teaches courses on 
investigations, the decision to pursue cases, and how to 
support accusations. In addition, he has broader 
responsibility for training on justice and the media. Bouroz 
is in a vital position where he is in daily contact with 
significant numbers of individuals who will become judges in 
France. 
Judge Bouroz was selected, by the Director of ENM, from among 
several candidates who had expressed interest in the IV 
program. The Director has been an excellent contact for the 
APP, and has been involved with providing outstanding 
candidates from ENM in the past. Since Bouroz is at the 
beginning of his minimum three year tenure, selection now 
would have the broadest possible effect over the next several 
years, not only for his potential impact on the student body, 
but also because of his interaction with the other faculty and 
administrators of the school. 
The judicial profession in France is one of the pillars of 
their governing system. It has become increasingly assertive 
and independent over the past generation. There has been 
growing interest in looking beyond France for ideas which 
might ameliorate the administration of Justice here. The 
recent adoption of "plaider coupable" which is a version of 
the U.S. plea-bargaining is an important example of this, and 
one in which Bourg and ENM are intensely interested. Given the 
important transnational judicial contacts that are requires in 
today's world, Judge Bouroz's selection is one that would have 
a major long-term ripple effect.
