SIPDIS 
how the sum of $205 million of Iraq debt had been attributed 
to Slovenia.  He explained that he was under the impression 
that Serbia and/or Montenegro was claiming all this debt for 
itself.  At any rate, Cerar was not aware that anything had 
been agreed among the FRY successors on this particular piece 
of debt.  Slovenia is not in a position to make a decision on 
debt forgiveness until it is certain which portion of the 
Iraq debt, if any, is ascribed to it.  He agreed to look into 
disbursing the rest of the funds Slovenia has previously 
pledged.  FM Rupel will lead the Slovene delegation to the 
conference.
