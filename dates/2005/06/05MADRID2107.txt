REF: STATE 100709 
 
Arturo Laclaustra, the Director General of Terrorism, 
International Affairs, and the United Nations at the MFA, 
will co-sign the Geneva Group's letter to the UN Secretary 
General highlighting the importance of management reform. 
Poloff discussed the UN reform letter with Deputy Director 
General for UN Affairs Juan Manuel Gonzales de Linares on 
June 1.  Gonzales de Linares told Poloff that the letter 
seemed reasonable, and he did not know why Spain had not 
signed it to date.  On June 2 after checking with Spain's 
Ambassador in Geneva and others in the MFA, Gonzales de 
Linares told Poloff that Spain agrees with the letter, and 
Laclaustra will sign the letter.
