SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION REPORT - IRAN IRAQ 
PARIS - TUESDAY, JUNE 28, 2005 
 
 
(A) SUBJECTS COVERED IN TODAY'S REPORT: 
 
¶1. IRAN 
¶2. IRAQ 
 
B) SUMMARY OF COVERAGE: 
 
A WIDE VARIETY OF MOSTLY DOMESTIC STORIES DOMINATE TODAY'S 
FRONT PAGES, WITH RIGHT-OF-CENTER LE FIGARO AND MARSEILLES- 
BASED REGIONAL LA PROVENCE DEVOTED TO ITER, THE EXPERIMENTAL 
NUCLEAR REACTOR. LA PROVENCE HEADLINES: "ITER'S SUNRAYS 
SHINING ON CADARACHE," WHICH IS THE FRENCH VENUE CHOSEN FOR 
THE REACTOR. LE FIGARO HEADLINES: "ITER, GALILEO: THE 
SUCCESSES OF EUROPEAN TECHNOLOGY." 
 
AMONG TODAY'S INTERNATIONAL NEWS, THE MEETINGS BETWEEN 
AMERICAN OFFICIALS AND IRAQI INSURGENTS CONTINUE TO SPILL INK: 
FOR LE FIGARO IT IS A SIGN "THAT LONDON AND WASHINGTON WANT TO 
INCLUDE SUNNI INSURGENTS IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS." IN 
REGIONAL OUEST FRANCE, EDITORIALIST JOSEPH LIMAGNE TITLES HIS 
COMMENTARY ON THE SITUATION IN IRAQ "FROM BAD TO WORSE." (SEE 
PART C) MENTION IS MADE IN SEVERAL OUTLETS OF PRESIDENT BUSH'S 
ADDRESS THIS EVENING IN FORT BRAGG, "COINCIDING WITH THE FIRST 
ANNIVERSARY OF THE TRANSITION OF POWER IN IRAQ." POPULAR RIGHT- 
OF-CENTER FRANCE SOIR TITLES: "IRAQ DESTABILIZES BUSH," (SEE 
PART C) WHILE LIBERATION WRITES: "TONIGHT, PRESIDENT BUSH WILL 
SPEAK TO THE NATION TO EXPLAIN THE ACTIONS OF HIS 
ADMINISTRATION, WHICH IS UNDER ACCUSATIONS OF HIDING THE 
REALITY OF WHAT IS GOING ON IN IRAQ." 
 
LE FIGARO CARRIES AN INTERVIEW WITH AMR MOUSSA, LEADER OF THE 
ARAB LEAGUE, ABOUT DEMOCRATIZATION. HE ALSO CONCLUDES ON 
SECRETARY RICE'S VISIT TO THE REGION: "THIS WAS SECRETARY 
 
SIPDIS 
RICE'S FIRST TRIP IN THE ARAB WORLD IN HER ROLE AS SECRETARY 
OF STATE. THE RESULT IS OVERALL POSITIVE. I BELIEVE THAT BOTH 
SHE AND THE U.S. NOW UNDERSTAND THAT THE PALESTINIAN QUESTION 
CANNOT BE LEFT ASIDE. IN THE ARAB WORLD DEMOCRACY MUST FOLLOW 
A CERTAIN PROCESS. DEMOCRACY IS ASKING THE PEOPLE WHAT ROAD 
THEY WANT TO TAKE TO BUILD THEIR COUNTRY. THOSE WHO WANT TO 
PLAY A ROLE NEED TO OFFER CHOICES THAT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS 
OF THE 21ST CENTURY." 
 
THE AFTERMATH OF THE IRANIAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION ELICITS 
MUCH COMMENTARY. LE FIGARO TITLES ON ITS FRONT PAGE: 
"WASHINGTON RAISES ITS VOICE," WHILE IN CATHOLIC LA CROIX THE 
QUESTION OF THE DAY IS: "CAN IRAN DO WITHOUT RELATIONS WITH 
THE U.S.?" THE ANSWER BY CERI RESEARCHER FARIDA ADELKHAH: 
"IRAN NEEDS THE U.S., IF ONLY IN ORDER TO HAVE A STABLE 
ENVIRONMENT. AHMADINEJAD'S REMARKS ABOUT THE U.S. WERE 
DESTINED FOR DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION. HIS SPEECH IS IRRESPONSIBLE 
BECAUSE IMPROVING RELATIONS WITH THE U.S. WAS EVERY 
CANDIDATE'S WATCHWORD. PARLIAMENT MEMBERS MADE CLEAR THEIR 
WISHES FOR D ENTE ON THE INTERNATIONAL SCENE. IRANIANS LIVE 
INSIDE THEIR OWN CONTRADICTIONS: THEY WANT TO EXIST ON THE 
INTERNATIONAL SCENE BUT THEY ALSO WANT THEIR INDEPENDENCE." 
 
RIGHT-OF-CENTER LES ECHOS CARRIES A COMMENTARY BY ECONOMIST 
NICOLAS BAVAREZ TITLED: "SHOCK THERAPY FOR EUROPE." AMONG HIS 
SUGGESTIONS FOR A POST-MAY 29 EUROPE: "THE MAD RUSH TO EXPAND 
EUROPE MUST BE HALTED. THIS IMPLIES POSTPONING MEMBERSHIP FOR 
BULGARIA AND ROMANIA, AND PUTTING A STOP TO THE NEGOTIATIONS 
WITH TURKEY, WHICH IS NOT PART OF EUROPE, NEITHER BY ITS 
CULTURE OR ITS HISTORY." 
 
LE MONDE REPORTS ON THE HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH JUNE 26TH REPORT ON 
ARBITRARY ARREST, DETENTION AND TORTURE IN THE NAME OF THE WAR 
ON TERRORISM IN THE UNITED STATES. 
 
LE MONDE ALSO REPORTS ON THE NOMINATION OF FORMER STATE 
DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL AND REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE MEMBER 
PATRICIA HARRISON TO BE PRESIDENT OF CPB AND COMMENTS: "HER 
NOMINATION TAKES PLACE JUST WHEN THE ATMOSPHERE BETWEEN THE 
WHITE HOUSE AND THE MEDIA SHOWS SIGNS OF TENSION." 
 
(C) SUPPORTING TEXT/BLOCK QUOTES: 
IRAN 
 
"WASHINGTON REVISES ITS IRANIAN POLICY" 
JEAN-LOUIS TURLIN IN RIGHT-OF-CENTER LE FIGARO (06/28): "THE 
ELECTION OF A HARD-LINER IN IRAN WILL NOT GIVE THE AMERICANS 
RENEWED CONFIDENCE IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH TEHRAN. EXPERTS 
BELIEVE THAT THE NEW IRANIAN PRESIDENT WILL NOT BOTHER TO PUT 
ON GLOVES IN HIS DEALINGS WITH THE AMERICANS AND THE 
EUROPEANS. THEY ALSO AGREE THAT A MILITARY APPROACH IS NOT AN 
OPTION. STRIKES AGAINST IRANIAN NUCLEAR INSTALLATIONS CANNOT 
BE GUARANTEED SUCCESS; THEY WOULD BE MILITARILY IMPOSSIBLE TO 
SUSTAIN BECAUSE OF THE IRAQI QUAGMIRE, AND POLITICALLY, THEY 
WOULD BE DANGEROUS FOR THE REGION AND DOMESTICALLY 
UNACCEPTABLE." 
 
IRAQ 
"FROM BAD TO WORSE" 
JOSEPH LIMAGNE IN REGIONAL OUEST FRANCE (06/28): "IT HAS BEEN 
BARELY A YEAR SINCE U.S. ARMY OFFICIALLY GAVE OVER THE REINS 
OF POWER TO THE IRAQI AUTHORITIES. THE SITUATION THEN WAS 
TRAGIC. TODAY, IT IS WORSE. GOING AFTER ARMED GUERRILLA GROUPS 
IS NOT ENOUGH. ONE CAN UNDERSTAND GEORGE BUSH, TONY BLAIR AND 
THE IRAQI PM ADMITTING TO TALKS WITH SOME OF THEIR 
ADVERSARIES. BUT NOTHING SAYS THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO RALLY 
THE MOST MODERATE AMONG THEM TO THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. STILL, 
EVERY AVENUE MUST BE EXPLORED. IF, AS MANY EXPERTS BELIEVE, 
THE NERVE CENTER OF AL-QAEDA IS NOW IN IRAQ, THEN IT IS 
ESSENTIAL TO DEPRIVE ZARQAWI OF LOCAL ALLIES. IT HAS BECOME 
VITAL TO STOP SUCH RAPPROCHEMENT. INCLUDING FOR US. EUROPEAN 
ANTI-TERRORIST EXPERTS ARE LOOKING INTO THIS VERY CLOSELY. 
BECAUSE YOUNG ISLAMISTS FROM EUROPE WHO ARE WAGING A `HOLY 
WAR' IN IRAQ, AS THEIR ELDERS DID IN AFGHANISTAN AND BOSNIA, 
WILL ONE DAY RETURN HOME. FOR THEM, IRAQ IS AT ONCE A GROUND 
FOR OPERATIONS AND A TERRORIST LEARNING CAMP. THIS IS WHY, 
WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT, THE OUTCOME OF THE IRAQI TRAGEDY 
CONCERNS US ALL." 
 
"U.S. CONFIRMS CONTACTS WITH GUERRILLAS" 
ADRIEN JAULMES IN RIGHT-OF-CENTER LE FIGARO (06/28): "ONE 
NEGOTIATES ONLY WITH ONE'S ENEMIES. IRAQ IS NO EXCEPTION TO 
THE RULE. THE DEMAND FOR A PULLOUT CALENDAR MADE BY THE 
INSURGENTS HAS BEEN REJECTED BY THE AMERICANS. FOR THEIR PART 
THE AMERICANS ARE SAID TO HAVE ASKED THE INSURGENTS TO STOP 
GIVING SUPPORT TO ZARQAWI. BUT THE INSURGENTS HAVE REJECTED 
THE REQUEST, SAYING THAT FOREIGN ALLIES ARE THE EQUIVALENT OF 
THE COALITION PUT TOGETHER BY THE U.S. TO INVADE IRAQ. IN 
SPITE OF THIS STALEMATE, THE FACT THAT WASHINGTON HAS 
ACKNOWLEDGED THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH TALKS MEANS THAT THE U.S. 
IS CHANGING ITS THINKING ON IRAQ. TWO YEARS AFTER THE SUNNI 
UPRISING, THE AMERICANS ARE BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE 
USE OF MILITARY FORCE CONTRIBUTES AS MUCH TO THE GUERRILLA'S 
DEVELOPMENT AS IT DOES TO ITS ERADICATION." 
 
"IRAQ DESTABILIZES BUSH" 
GUILLAUME DUMANT IN RIGHT-OF-CENTER FRANCE SOIR (06/28): "ONE 
YEAR TO THE DAY AFTER THE TRANSITION OF POWER IN IRAQ, 
PRESIDENT BUSH WILL TRY TO JUSTIFY HIS POLICY'S LEGITIMACY 
BEFORE A MILITARY AUDIENCE IN FORT BRAGG. THE `TERRIBLE 
DIFFICULTIES' PRESIDENT BUSH SPOKE OF AFTER HIS MEETING WITH 
THE IRAQI PM ARE EXACTLY WHAT IS MAKING AMERICANS DOUBTFUL. IN 
ORDER TO COUNTERBALANCE THIS LACK OF CONFIDENCE A VAST PUBLIC 
RELATIONS CAMPAIGN IS UNDERWAY, WITH SEVERAL MEDIA APPEARANCES 
BY BUSH AND RUMSFELD." WOLFF
