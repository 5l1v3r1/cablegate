An International Visitor Program for "Depute" HUYGHE would 
address the MPP Strategic Goal of "Economic Prosperity and 
Security" by promoting exchanges between U.S. policymakers and 
an important French politician. It would also help a lawmaker 
who has already worked on financial reform to better 
understand U.S. financial markets in order to use that 
knowledge to "ease the regulatory burden on financial 
markets." 
END MEMO NOM-POST-OBJ: 
START MEMO NOM-POST-RCMD: 
Nominating officer recommends a program that focuses on 
Monsieur Huyghe's interest in financial reform and his 
involvement with cleaning up industrial pollution. Either an 
individual or a group program would be appropriate. Meetings 
in Washington should focus on financial and environmental 
legislation and regulation. Visits to the New York Stock 
Exchange and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to 
see the system in operation would be most useful, as would the 
opportunity to see successfully completed as well as ongoing 
clean-up operations. Love Canal comes to mind.

NOMINATING-OFFICER: Richard Huckaby 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Sebastien Huyghe is definitely a rising star in the UMP (Union 
pour un Mouvement Populaire). Having deposed Lille's Socialist 
Mayor Martine AUBRY from her seat in the National Assembly in 
the last general election in 2002, he has attracted both local 
and national attention. A very active "depute", his interests 
include finance law and the environment. For example, he was 
instrumental in pushing through legislation reducing the tax 
burden of expatriate executives living in France in 2003, and 
he serves as Vice-President of the legislative study group on 
historical environmental pollution. He is also a member of the 
group responsible for France-U.S. relations. 
Although he has hardly any U.S. experience (about two weeks 
total), he has an open mind and a generally positive view. An 
International Visitor program would allow him to learn 
firsthand about various aspects of the American political 
scene, including the functioning of legislative bodies and the 
private/government partnerships which have been developed to 
address environmental problems. He has the personality and the 
intellectual capacity to counter some of the traditional anti- 
Americanism of French intellectuals and politicians. The 
opportunity for him to learn about U.S. pollution control 
technologies could also bring business to American companies. 
It is certainly in the interest of the U.S. government for 
this young political leader to have the opportunity to 
experience directly various aspects of U.S. political and 
cultural life.

Nominee hopes to become an elected official.  His ambition is 
to win a seat in the National Assembly.  If he should succeed 
in doing so, his having learned about the U.S. through the IV

Nominee is an active politician with ambitions to win elective 
office -- though (like many members of the ruling UMP party) 
he lost his bid last March for a regional counsellorship in 
his native region of Normandy.  Nominee is a well-respected, 
up-and-coming member of the Gaullist "current" of the center- 
right.  His interest (and governing experience as a former 
prefect and bureaucrat in the Ministry of the Interior 
following his graduation from France's elite Ecole Normale 
d'Administration) is in domestic governance.  In addition, as 
Chief of Staff to the President of the National Assembly he 
has considerable influence on legislators' approach to both 
domestic and international affairs matters.  Nominee has never 
been to the U.S.  A better understanding of the U.S. and the 
U.S. policy-making process should inform -- to our benefit -- 
nominee's contributions to policy making in France.

We hope Mr. Bechu will gain a better understanding of the U.S. 
political system, and greater knowledge of American values and 
culture, thus promoting mutual understanding between our two 
countries.  We would also like to see him develop a network of 
contacts in the U.S., especially at the county and municipal 
level, with whom he could exchange ideas about economic 
development.  This exchange of experiences would help promote 
economic development of the U.S.  Ideally, Mr. Bechu will

him toward cooperation with the U.S., thus enhancing our own

START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Christophe Bechu is the youngest person ever elected President 
of a General Council in France.  He was elected a municipal 
councilor of his hometown of Avrille even before completing 
his studies at Sciences Po in Paris.  Although clearly 
ambitious, he has kept his focus on the demands of his current 
job, where he is responsible for a team of 1200 General 
Council employees.  He has made a point of visiting each 
canton of his department to listen to the needs of the 
citizens.  A devoted member of the conservative UMP party, 
Bechu is nevertheless well liked by his political opponents, 
and respected for his efforts to improve the economic 
situation in Maine-et-Loire.  Bechu has made only one brief 
trip to the U.S. to study a botanical park that he hopes to 
recreate in his department as part of his economic development 
plan.  He would thus benefit greatly from exposure to the 
American political system at this early stage in his promising 
career.  As he assumes positions of greater authority in the 
French government, his IV experience will make him more 
inclined to work cooperatively with the U.S. on matters of 
mutual interest.

Philippe Rouault, elected Member of the National Assembly in 
2002, is a former mayor of the suburban town of Pace, and 
former member of the General Council of the Ille-et-Vilaine 
Department.  Rouault is a rising star in the UMP party and 
achieved national prominence in September 2003 when he 
attended the WTO Cancun Ministerial meeting as a special envoy 
of the French Parliament.  Rouault has always been interested 
in French-American relations, but has had little direct 
exposure to the U.S.  In his role as the committee reporter 
for the Environmental Commission of the French Parliament, 
Rouault has taken a keen interest in rural development in 
order to advance the interests of his largely rural 
constituency.  An IV program on rural development and 
governance will enable Mr. Rouault to draw on the experiences 
of rural communities in the U.S. in fashioning a strategy for 
his district.  It will also help ensure continued positive 
relations between the U.S. and this young man with a bright 
political future.

START MEMO NOM-POST-OBJ: 
We hope Mr. Nocquet will gain an understanding on how rural 
areas cope with an evolving economy and ensuing population 
shifts, with a special focus on ways to attract new families, 
develop new business and maintain basic services. 
We would also like to see him develop a network of contacts in 
the U.S., especially at the county and municipal level, with 
whom he could exchange ideas about economic development. 
Ideally, Mr Nocquet will develop a greater appreciation for 
the U.S. that will incline him toward cooperation with the 
U.S. as he moves upward through the French political ranks.

START MEMO NOM-POST-RCMD: 
Mr Nocquet should spend some time in Washington, DC to meet 
with elected officials and government representatives. This 
will enable him to gain a better understanding of the U.S. 
political system, and of federal government programs that 
address economic development. He should also visit a few small 
cities in rural areas where he can speak to elected officials 
and economic development specialists to share ideas on how to 
integrate development goals in a mixed rural/urban setting.

NOMINATING-OFFICER: Emilie Salieges 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Olivier Nocquet is the young, energetic and very forward- 
looking parliamentary assistant of Senator Jean Bizet, the UMP 
Senator from the La Manche department of Normandy.  A junior 
politician-in-the-making, Mr. Nocquet is committed to the 
Normandy region through both family ties and his personal 
desire to assist his native region in its attempt to gain a 
more solid economic and political footing.  La Manche is home 
to the largest number of agricultural enterprises in the 
Normandy region.  Characterized by small towns that rely on a 
rural economy, La Manche is very concerned by agricultural 
issues between France, the U.S. and the E.U. It faces problems 
like rural migration to urban areas, closings of small 
businesses and unfavorable implementation of farming quota 
policies.  In this regard, Mr. Nocquet works hard with Senator 
Jean Bizet, a very pro-American Senator who is the head of the 
Senate's Biotechnology Committee and special assistant to the 
Foreign Trade Minister, to ensure rural economic survival in 
this part of France.  Although Mr. Nocquet is very 
professional, he appears to APP Rennes staff to have little 
concrete information on the U.S., its policies and rural 
development practices. We believe that an IV grant for Mr. 
Nocquet would provide him with the contacts and factual 
information he needs to promote a mutually beneficial dialogue 
between the U.S. and the agricultural stronghold he serves.
