SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) In this cable, Post provides an update to Reftel 
A, which was sent in January 2005 in response to AmConsul 
Jerusalem's request in Reftel B for information on the 
status of Palestinian security internees held by Coalition 
Forces inside Iraq.  As of May 31, 2005, Multi-National 
Force - Iraq held eight identified Palestinians; their 
individual status is detailed below.  Unless otherwise 
indicated, all information may be passed to Palestinian 
Authority officials. 
 
¶2.  (U) The files of security internees are subject to 
review every 90-180 days by the Combined Review and Release 
Board, an Iraqi-majority panel staffed by representatives 
from the Iraqi Ministries of Justice, Interior, and Human 
Rights, as well as MNF-I.  The CRRB currently approves 
40% of the cases it reviews for release, with the remaining 
60% recommended for continued detention on the assessment 
that release would pose an imperative threat to Iraqi 
security.  All detainees remain subject to criminal 
prosecution by the Central Criminal Court of Iraq.

CASE DETAILS 
------------ 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Mohammed Saleh Hassan (ISN No. 150447) was 
detained by MNF-I on September 4, 2003; Mr. Hassan was in 
possession of explosives at the time of his apprehension, 
and is believed to have been involved in attacks on 
Coalition Forces. (Do not pass this sentence: the FBI has 
placed a hold on this detainee due to active 
interrogation.) 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Marwan Helmi Saeed Dabhof (ISN No. 162141) was 
detained by MNF-I on July 16, 2004 due to his involvement 
in a terrorist cell manufacturing Vehicle-Borne Improvised 
Explosive Devices (VBIEDs) and linked to al-Qaeda. On 
February 9, 2005, the Board (see para (2) recommended Mr. 
Dabhof for continued internment as an ongoing security 
threat. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Awad Ahmed Awad Sahknini (ISN No. 166831) was 
detained by MNF-I on November 24, 2005 based on information 
suggesting that he was a high-level terrorist cell 
organizer associated with Tawheet al-Jihad. He was 
recommended for continued internment by the Board on April 
5, 2005. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Jayyab Mahmoud Hasan Ehmedat (ISN No. 106593) has 
been recommended for release.  His file has been sent to 
CENTCOM for approval, a process which normally takes four- 
to-six weeks; should CENTCOM concur, he will be free to 
depart Iraq voluntarily, or to seek the permission of the 
Iraqi government for his release inside Iraq. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Ahmed Hussain Yousif (ISN No. 107298) was 
detained on April 23, 2003 for illegal entry into Iraq and 
engagement in anti-Coalition activities. He was recommended 
for continued internment by the Board on January 5, 2005, 
and is currently facing trial at the Central Criminal 
Court. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Ibraheem Mahmood Mohammed (ISN No. 154750) was 
detained on December 5, 2003 in possession of blank 
passports and bomb-making equipment. He was recommended by 
the Board for continued internment on April 15, 2005, and 
is currently being considered for prosecution by the 
Central Criminal Court. 
 
¶9.  (SBU) Mohammed Awad Ahmed (ISN No. 166826) was detained 
with seven others (five wounded) during fighting in 
Fallujah on November 25, 2004.  He was found near a weapons 
stockpile, and his hands tested positive for gunpowder. The 
Board voted for continued internment on March 15, 2005. 
 
¶10.  (SBU) Osama Feysa Mohammed (ISN No. 172700) was 
detained on May 2, 2005 during a targeted raid on his 
cousin's house.  His file has been sent to the Commanding 
General of Task Force 134 for consideration for expedited 
release. 
 
¶11.  (SBU) Coalition Forces have no record of holding a 
Palestinian detainee with a name similar to "Ahmad Badran 
Fares Abueid". The identification number provided by the 
Palestinian Authority for this detainee, 106319, belongs 
to an Iraqi national named Abbas Mahmud al-Azawi, resident 
in Diyala Province, detained April 14, 2003 and released 
thirteen days later.
