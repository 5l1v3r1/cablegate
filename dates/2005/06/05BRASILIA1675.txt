SUBJECT: BRAZIL: RESPONSE TO NEW TEXT FOR PKO SOUTH DIPNOTE 
 
REF: STATE 112461 
 
¶1. (SBU)  Poloff delivered reftel points to Luisa Lopes, 
Deputy Director of the Office to Combat Illicit Transnational 
Activities (COCIT) at the Ministry of External Relations 
(MRE).  Lopes noted that the proposed language was similar to 
past US/GOB agreements and is in line with agreements between 
the GOB and other countries.  Lopes believed COCIT could 
provide a definitive response to reftel before early next 
week.  Given that Lopes will be traveling next week and COCIT 
Office Director Marcos Pinta Gama is out of town, post is not 
optimistic that COCIT will respond before the week of July 4 
(Note: Lopes and Pinta Gama are the only two MRE officials in 
COCIT who can provide an official response. End note). 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Post will continue to pressure COCIT for a reply. 
In the coming days, post may need to raise the issue with the 
office of Antonio Patriota, Under Secretary for Political 
Affairs at the MRE, if a timely response from COCIT is not 
received.
