¶1.  We delivered ref A demarche to MFA Northeast 
Mediterranean Affairs A/DDG Bilman June 14.  Bilman was not 
aware of the incident.  He said he would "definitely look 
into the matter."  However, his "first reaction" was that the 
restriction is "not unacceptable."  He wondered whether the 
Vienna Convention applies to a "conflict area" and added that 
the U.S. needs to be aware of "sensitivities" concerning 
Varosha.  He asked rhetorically what would happen if an FSN 
took a camera and photographed Varosha. 
 
¶2.  We replied that there was no conflict nor any reasonable 
likelihood of conflict in Varosha, and that it is the Vienna 
Convention right of the U.S. Embassy, not Turkish 
authorities, to select personnel to perform our diplomatic 
business.  We pointed out that a contingent of six Turkish 
authorities accompanied Embassy Nicosia during the visit (ref 
B), and there was no danger of any unauthorized activity. 
 
¶3.  (C) Comment:  Judging by Bilman's reaction and demaenor, 
the MFA is not convinced that we mean business on this issue. 
 When Embassy Nicosia plans its next such visit we would, 
with Department's concurrence, request advance notice so we 
can again demarche the Turks energetically.  End Comment.
