¶1.  Poloff delivered reftel points to Walid Obeidat in the 
Foreign Minister's private office on June 20.  Obeidat did 
not offer a substantive response, but noted that Jordan's 
financial situation would likely preclude monetary donations 
to the mission in Darfur.  However, he said that he would 
pass the points to relevant parties within the GOJ to 
ascertain whether other types of assistance could be offered.
