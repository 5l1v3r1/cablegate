------- 
¶1. (U) On June 1, 2005, the Department of Minerals

Government Announces Marginal Price Decreases 
-------------------------------------- 
¶2.   (U) On June 1, the Department of Minerals and 
Energy (DME) reduced the retail price of gasoline by 
3.1% and wholesale prices of diesel and kerosene by 
an average of 3.3% and 6%, respectively.  The 
primary reason for the move was the lower price of 
imported crude oil during the May 1 to May 31 period 
of assessment.  The weakening of the rand towards 
the end of May and a surcharge to balance refinery 
losses incurred during the previous month lessened 
the decrease somewhat as prices moved from all time 
highs in May.  The tables below show the decrease in 
the average price of fuel in Johannesburg and 
components for the new price.
