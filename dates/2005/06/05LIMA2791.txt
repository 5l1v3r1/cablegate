¶1.   Post applauds the re-establishment of the formerly Jazz 
Ambassadors program through the American Music Abroad and would 
like to be considered in one of the 2006 tours. 
 
¶2.   We prefer the month of February and a weeklong tour (5 
program days plus 2 travel days). Best days for performances in 
Lima are from Tuesday through Thursday.  Nevertheless, Post would 
also like to program quartet in at least one provincial city. 
 
¶3.   MPP goals include jazz performances as part of its cultural 
objectives. Peru has a tradition for jazz and the Lima Binational 
center has contributed in this respect, sponsoring a one-week 
festival every year in April.  Since 2002, PAS Lima has co- 
sponsored this internationally recognized jazz festival as part 
of Jazz Appreciation Month (JAM). The city of Lima is becoming 
the Jazz Latin American city with several Peruvian groups, which 
perform throughout the year, as well as several radio stations, 
which sponsor jazz programs.  PAS will continue its support in 
raising the U.S. cultural profile in Peru. 
 
¶4.   A Hip-Hop Quartet would also be welcome as it would also 
help promote U.S. culture and would enhance mutual understanding 
between the United States and Peru.  Most recently Post presented 
a project for funding through the Performing Arts Initiative 
Program.  The project, which unfortunately was not selected, was 
intended to offer a vital, creative, and professional alternative 
for young people who are susceptible to delinquency, vandalism, 
and drugs. 
 
¶5.    Cultural presentations as the proposed gives the mission 
the opportunity to invite key contacts in Lima and in the 
provinces. Post will also program a performance for an audience 
composed by massive affluence of people from middle and low 
social classes.  In the province Post would reach native and/or 
rural communities who are rarely exposed to U.S. culture. 
 
¶6.   In the short term, such a performance would provide 
Peruvians with a better understanding of U.S. culture and musical 
tradition.  In the long term, this would promote and strengthen 
the bonds of friendship between our countries.
