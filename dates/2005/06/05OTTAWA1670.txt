START MEMO POST-OBJ: 
Daniel Igali is a high profile, first-time candidate for the 
British Columbia Legislative Assembly with the potential for 
greatness in the B.C. Liberal Party. Nominated by his party 
to replace the incumbent in the Liberal-held Surrey-Newton 
Electoral District, he is a strong contender to retain the 
electoral district for the Liberals in the May 2005 
provincial elections. Daniel is young, popular, and 
energetic. He also shows a strong interest in international 
affairs and counter terrorism. In short, he is exactly the 
type of talent we look for in identifying future Canadian 
leaders for the IVL Program. 
Daniel Igali is internationally known as the Canadian 
wrestler who, in the 2000 Sydney Olympics, won gold, knelt 
down and kissed the Canadian flag.  Since then, he has been 
repeatedly interviewed by the media including all major 
Canadian newspapers, CBC: Life and Times, Sportsnet and 
Reader's Digest.  Attracted by his "star appeal," the 
provincial BC Liberals recruited him to run in the May 2005 
elections. 
Daniel came to Canada as a refugee from poverty-stricken 
Eniwari, Nigeria, to pursue an education and a career in 
sports.  He is currently completing a Masters Degree in 
criminology and shows particular interest in counter 
terrorism efforts and international politics. During his 
high achieving wrestling career, he became the 1994 African 
Champion, the first male Canadian world wrestling champion 
and a gold medallist in the 2000 Athens Olympics. 
As a young person with star appeal and great potential, we 
feel he will benefit tremendously from the IVL Program. 
Daniel is very committed to improving the lives of others 
through advocacy and community work.  The Igali Foundation 
Inc is a not-for-profit foundation that aids underprivileged 
children worldwide.  Locally, he devotes much of his time on 
the "Keep Sweating Tour", where he speaks to children and 
corporations on the benefits of healthy living and proper 
conduct.  He also successfully funded and lobbied for the 
construction of a new school and community center in his 
hometown in Nigeria. 
Daniel has expressed a strong interest in participating in 
the IVL Program to learn more about U.S. efforts to 
incorporate counter terrorism into its overall foreign 
policy. The insight he would gain from this program would be 
invaluable as Daniel moves into an influential position in 
the B.C. Legislature Assembly. We are excited about the rare 
opportunity to nominate someone certain to become an 
important player in B.C. politics to participate in the IVL 
Program. 
END MEMO POST-OBJ: 
START MEMO POST-RCMD: 
With to Mr. Igali's background in criminology and his 
interest in counter-terrorism efforts, we recommend him to 
participate in a multiregional program on counter-terrorism. 
Through such a program, he will be able to learn firsthand 
how the US is combatting terrorism domestically and 
internationally at the local, state and federal levels. 
Please note that Mr. Igali goes by the name "Daniel Igali."

he will continue to be an important player and respected 
public figure in western Canada. 
Mr. Igali's participation in the IVLP would support the 
Mission goal of advancing  counterterrorism cooperation with 
Canada.  With a 5,000-mile border with the United States, 
Canada is an indispensable partner in the U.S. war against 
terrorism.
