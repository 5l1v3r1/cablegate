ZAMAN/CUMHURIYET/YENI 
SAFAK/RADIKAL/HURRIYET/SABAH/GUNDEM/EVRENSEL: A medium-scale 
tremor in Bingol caused damage in many buildings and wounded 50 
people. The Turkish Red Crescent dispatched relief items 
including food, blankets, and tents to the region where schools 
have been closed for two days as well. 
ZAMAN: It is alleged that cooperation has been taking place 
between PKK and Hizbullah. According to a piece of news in the 
Aksiyon Magazine this week, PKK has given some of its C-4 
explosives to Hizbullah in order to distract the security 
officials' attention. Taking advantage of the vacuum of 
authority in Iraq, PKK allegedly acquired C-4 explosives during 
the looting of military warehouses in Iraq and infiltrated 
approximately 1000 kilos of those explosives into Turkey. PKK 
leader Murat Karayilan reportedly announced in a statement in 
May that PKK signed a new agreement with Hizbullah and wanted to 
benefit from the Hizbullah's experiences in urban areas. 
ZAMAN/GUNDEM: The dead body of the Syrian Kurdish religious 
figure Sheikh Mohammad Mashuk Xaznevi, was found in Deir el Zor 
town on June 1, 2005 after he was reportedly kidnapped from the 
Islamic Studies Center in Damascus on May 8 and allegedly 
exposed to torture for three weeks. The Kurds hold Damascus 
responsible for the assassination and undertook demonstrations 
in his birthplace Qamichli, where 5 persons were reportedly 
killed and 33 others, including 3 policemen, wounded during the 
tumult.

see anybody shedding tears."  Meanwhile, soldiers killed in 
clashes in Cicekli village of Tunceli were buried in Gaziantep,
