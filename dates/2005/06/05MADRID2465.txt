(SBU) Spanish Defense Ministry's inquiries on license number 
946549 involving an unknown Spanish firm Paramount Aircraft 
Services have indicated that the Spanish Air Force has 
not/not ordered spare parts for its P-3 Orion Aircraft 
through the company.  The MOD informed us June 27 that that 
it has had no contact with Paramount Aircraft Services and 
has placed no purchase orders of any type with the company. 
Officials told us that they confirmed this information with 
the Spanish Embassy in Washington.
