¶1. Embassy on May 25 provided Ref A-B talking points in 
Spanish to MFA UN-OAS Director Michelle Cohen, emphasizing 
the importance of fiscal restraint in the proposed ILO budget 
for 2006-2007 and U.S. preference for Barbados over Cuba as 
the Caribbean candidate for the ILO Governing Body.  The same 
day we provided the talking points to the Labor Ministry's 
director of international relations, Nelson Reyes, who plans 
to accompany Labor Minister Jose Ramon Fadul to Geneva. 
Reyes informed us that the Dominican Republic "is totally in 
agreement" with our position on the ILO budget.  On the 
competing candidacies of Cuba and Barbados for the ILO 
Governing Body, Reyes said he personally would prefer 
Barbados because of Cuba's violations of labor union rights 
under ILO conventions 97 and 98.  However, he said the Labor 
Minister would decide the Dominican Republic's position, and 
Reyes did not know how that would come out.
