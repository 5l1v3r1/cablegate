¶1.  Ministry of Industry and Commerce Director of Foreign 
Trade Relations Abdul Razak Zainalabedin told EconOff May 15 
that Bahrain submitted its initial offer in the ongoing 
General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) negotiations 
March 31, 2003 and held its first round of bilateral meetings 
with members of the WTO, including the United States, May 
¶2003.  Zainalabedin emphasized that the GOB shares the USG 
view that it is in every member's interest to participate in 
the services negotiations, both to secure a positive outcome 
on services itself and in support of wider Doha Development 
Agenda objectives. 
 
¶2.  Zainalebedin said the Ministry of Industry and Commerce 
is engaging with appropriate GOB officials to finalize 
Bahrain's revised WTO services negotiation offer (Ref B) and 
that the GOB expects to meet the May deadline.  Bahrain will 
send a delegation to Geneva to hold another round of 
bilaterals during the upcoming services cluster June 27-July
