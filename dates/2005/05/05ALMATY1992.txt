immediate substantive response.

Minister of Labor and Social Protection, Gulzhana 
Karagusova, would lead the GOK delegation to the June

heads the Eurasian Industrial Association.  His business 
interests are primarily in metals, and his main customer in 
Kazakhstan is Mittal Steel.  Mashkevich is also reputed to
