Per reftel request, Embassy contacted "ROVI Laboratorios 
Farmaceuticos."  An assistant to principal investigator Juan 
Lopez-Belmonte informed us that ROVI is part of a three- 
party consortium which also includes an Austrian and German 
companies.  The project is currently in the phase of 
scientific research development and ROVI's eventual role 
would be to package the product.  However, our interlocutor 
stressed that ROVI has not yet signed a contract and thus 
its eventual participation in the consortium is not yet 
assured.
