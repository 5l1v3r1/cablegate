Mr. MATLOCK, 
 
      The TGS Scientific Decision Support Center (SDSC) 
currently uses Extended Air Defense Simulation (EADSIM) 
version 11 R-06 for NATO Missile Defense (MD) Studies as a 
member of Modeling and Simulation Team (MST) and Bilateral MD 
Architecture Analysis Study under the terms and conditions of 
the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed between our 
governments in June 2001. 
 
      The aforementioned MOU enables TU to acquire and get 
necessary services for current version of EADSIM until June 
2008 via the consent of Missile Defense Agency (MDA). 
 
      Within this context, I kindly request the release of 
new version of EADSIM (v.12) to the TGS SDSC.  Please note 
that the administrative paperwork e.g., user information 
request, user site registration, MOU and Software Utility 
Agreement for release of EADSIM, has already been completed 
and sent to Teledyne Brown Engineering. 
 
 
 
Sincerely,
