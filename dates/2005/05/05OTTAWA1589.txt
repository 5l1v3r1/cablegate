NOMINATING-OFFICER: Ottawa Econ/Bud Locklear 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Since April 2004 Ms. Qi Wang has served as a Policy Analyst 
within the Privy Council Office's Border Task Force, a group 
that was created in the wake of 9-11 to provide direct 
support to the Canadian Deputy Prime Minister on the U.S.- 
Canada Smart Border Declaration and its associated Action 
Plan.  Ms. Wang works to develop advice and policy and to 
coordinate horizontal border initiatives by Canadian 
government departments with the view of advancing the 
objectives of border security and facilitation. 
The Borders Task Force, although small, plays a key role in 
the management of the U.S.-Canada relationship along the 
border; the Task Force's chief interlocutors in the USG are 
at the White House (Homeland Security Council), DHS 
Headquarters (Office of the Secretary) and the Embassy. 
By increasing the knowledge and sophistication about the 
United States among members of the Task Force we will help 
ensure that U.S.-Canada relations on the key files of trade 
and security benefit from a clear vision and understanding 
of American policy, practice and interests. 
Through the IVLP, we hope Ms. Wang will gain a more refined 
sense of economic, political, security and social issues 
facing the U.S.; the workings of the U.S. government; and 
the myriad factors that influence U.S. foreign and domestic 
policy.  It is also her hope that the extended stay in the 
U.S. will give her the opportunity to better experience 
American culture and regional variations. 
While Ms. Wang has had the opportunity to develop contacts 
in the Government of the United States as a result of her 
position at the Borders Task Force and her work takes her 
across the border about once every six weeks, she considers, 
and we agree, that she has had fairly limited exposure to 
the United States.  The business trips to the U.S.: 
Washington DC, Detroit, Buffalo have been restricted to a 
couple of days for the most part and not particularly 
conducive to immersing oneself in American culture or 
receiving sophisticated analysis of broad American 
interests.  In terms of personal travel, she has had the 
chance to visit New York and Boston. 
We fully expect that Ms. Wang will ascend to positions of 
significant importance and influence in the Canadian 
government.
