NOMINATING-OFFICER: Christopher Davis; Genevieve Thomassin 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Abdelhaq Nabaoui has the delicate task of being the first ever 
president of the Alsace Muslim Regional Council (Conseil 
Regional du Culte Musulman, CRCM), established in 2003. 
Islamic tendencies in Alsace reflect those elsewhere in 
France, with the added feature of stronger Turkish 
representation, given the proximity to the large Turkish 
immigrant population in Germany.  Nabaoui and his UOIF list 
joined forces with the Turkish Milli Gorus list to win nine of 
21 seats in the CRCM board.  Nabaoui himself emerged as the 
strongest consensual candidate for president. 
With such diversity, even rivalry, among tendencies obliged to 
o 
cohabitate in artificial constructs such as the CRCM, all is 
not sweetness and light within the CRCM.  Nabaoui contends, 
however, that the cooperation within the Alsace CRCM is better 
than that at the national level (Conseil Francais du Culte 
Musulman, CFCM). 
In fact, Abdelhaq Nabaoui has won the respect of regional 
officials, regional representatives of the GOF, and academics 
for his outreach (more than 200 visits) to the Islamic 
community in Alsace, and to local and regional authorities, 
raising their awareness on issues facing local Muslim 
populations.  And vice versa.  For example, Nabaoui was 
instrumental in getting the regional Muslim community to 
support the GOF's position on headscarf legislation during the 
Chesnot-Malbrunot hostage crisis, from August to December 
Â¶2004.  He nonetheless feels that the GOF, which created the 
CRCMs, is not doing enough to provide office space and 
accoutrements to them. 
Nabaoui has assumed his responsibilities at some sacrifice, 
taking a cut in pay in his teaching profession of about 500 
euros per month to give himself the time for his outreach 
activities. 
Abdelhaq Nabaoui is now one of the prominent Islamic leaders 
in Alsace. While it is too early to tell who will emerge as 
president of the next CRCM after elections in June, Nabaoui 
should continue to be an influential moderate in the Muslim 
community.
