SUBJECT: PERU: OAS WORKING GROUP ON RACISM 
 
REF: STATE 82983 
 
¶1.  Poloff delivered the demarche on the proposed OAS Working 
Group on Racism (Reftel) to the Foreign Ministry's Director 
of Human Rights, Carlos Roman, and to its Director of OAS and 
Hemispheric Affairs, Carlos Chocano, on 5/5.  Neither offered 
an official reply.  Chocano indicated, however, that Peru has 
historically backed initiatives against racism put forward by 
Brazil in the OAS.  Unofficially, Roman said that Peru had 
reacted favorably to the proposal for the working group to 
develop an Interamerican Convention in consultations with 
Brazil. 
 
¶2.  Emboffs will continue to raise this issue with the 
Foreign Ministry.
