SUBJECT: NEA PDAS CHENEY'S PRESS COVERAGE IN BAHRAIN 
 
 
¶1.  PDAS Elizabeth Cheney conducted a press roundtable 
during her May 10 visit to Bahrain to discuss the Forum 
for the Future and U.S. support for democracy in the 
region.  Press reports on May 11 generally reflected the 
editorial slant of the Bahraini media with pro-government 
papers focusing on Cheney's positive comments about 
Bahrain's reforms, and independent newspaper Al Wasat 
highlighting her remarks about the need for continued 
political openness. 
 
¶2.  Pro-government Al-Ayam and Bahrain Tribune both 
headlined, "US Official Praises Kingdom's Openness and 
Freedom," and Gulf Daily News headlined, "US Hails 
Bahrain Reforms" and "Process of Change in the Arab World 
Praised."  Al Wasat wrote about the plans for the Forum 
for the Future and Cheney's comments on the need for 
continued political reforms and economic openness.  Al 
Wasat also highlighted the important role that civil 
societies hope to play in the Forum.  Many of Al Wasat's 
reporters are active in non-governmental or political 
organizations, and their coverage tends to reflect their 
involvement in reform issues. 
 
¶3.  Press coverage of Cheney's meeting with Shaikha 
Sabika, wife of the King, and other leading Bahraini 
women, reinforced the important role of women in 
Bahrain's society.  Press stories centered on the goals 
of MEPI's women's pillar, including the role of 
Bahraini women in civil society, and preparations for 
increased women's involvement in the 2006 Municipal 
Council and Parliamentary elections.  All Bahraini 
newspapers quoted Cheney's remarks hailing the experience 
of Bahraini women as evidenced by their leading positions 
in the government and society.
