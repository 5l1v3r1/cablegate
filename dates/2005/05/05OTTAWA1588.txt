SUBJECT: FY 2006 IVLP, ITT on U.S. Public Policy Issues and 
the Broadcast Media 
 
REFERENCE:  OTTAWA 1504 
 
¶1.   Mission Canada proposes a two-person International 
Visitor Leadership Program which would acquaint two 
accomplished broadcast journalists in Halifax and Winnipeg 
with major public policy debates in the U.S. and how they 
are covered in the broadcast media.  Through meetings with 
federal executive, legislative and judicial branches, state 
and local governments, NGOs, industry and professional 
associations, and their counterparts in U.S. media 
organizations, they would gain insights into a) the workings 
of the U.S. political system, and b) how the diverse views 
of Americans merge in the policy-making process.  Specific 
issues on which they might focus include U.S. Homeland 
Security (e.g. balancing security measures with privacy and 
civil liberties concerns); U.S. Trade Policy (e.g. 
commitment to free trade, positions on agricultural trade 
distortions in world markets, U.S. trade remedies as applied 
to Canada-U.S. softwood, wheat and hog trade); energy and 
environmental policy, or domestic health care and social 
security debates. 
 
¶2.   Proposed participants, Wade Keller, Senior Producer, 
ATV news, Halifax, Nova Scotia; and Kacey Wilson, 
Host/Producer "Today So Far", CJOB 68 Radio, Winnipeg, both 
have full country team approval.

START MEMO PROJ-DESC: 
This program would acquaint two emerging broadcast 
journalists with major public policy debates in the U.S. and 
how they are covered in the broadcast media.  Through 
meetings with federal executive, legislative and judicial 
branches, state and local governments, NGOs, industry and 
professional associations, and naturally, their counterparts 
in U.S. media organizations, they would gain insights into 
how the differing views of Americans merge in the policy- 
making process.  Specific issues on which they might focus 
include U.S. Homeland Security (e.g. balancing security 
measures with privacy and civil liberties concerns); U.S. 
Trade Policy (e.g. commitment to free trade, positions on 
agricultural trade distortions in world markets, U.S. trade 
remedies as applied to Canada-U.S. softwood, wheat and hog 
trade); Energy and Environmental Policy (respective 
contributions of energy companies, auto companies, 
alternative energy researchers and producers, nuclear power 
proponents, conservationists, public utilities, and NGOs), 
Prescription Drug Trade, or the Social Security Debate.

NOMINATING-OFFICER: ConGen Len Hill 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Mr. Keller is one of this post's most important media 
contacts. His position as Senior Producer for ATV news, the 
Atlantic regional affiliate for Canada's largest private 
sector broadcaster, CTV, puts him in regular contact with 
the Consulate.  He works with us in coordinating TV 
interviews of visiting U.S. officials such as the 
Ambassador, U.S. Under Secretary for Commerce Grant Aldonas 
and other high ranking officials.  He also works closely 
with other host government officials and business and 
community leaders in coordinating similar interviews. 
ATV news is broadcast throughout three of Canada's four 
Atlantic Provinces and has captured over 350,000 viewers 
each evening, more than the Toronto CTV affiliate.  As such, 
Mr. Keller's work has a direct influence on how Atlantic 
Canadians view the U.S.-Canada relationship and U.S. foreign 
policy.  An IVLP project would give him direct exposure to 
politics and policymaking in the United States, as well as 
media trends, that will strengthen his ability to interpret 
United States news and events for the Canadian public.

NOMINATING-OFFICER: ConGen Todd Schwartz 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Engaging media leaders in Canada's central region in 
dialogue with Americans is important to post, both to 
provide issue-specific information and to shape reporters 
overall picture of the United States.   Although young at 
26, Kacey Wilson has  come into her own since taking over 
CJOB's afternoon call-in show late last year.  She has a 
quick and solid grasp of a wide variety of issues, and has 
an overall favorable impression of the United States. 
Wilson has a promising future ahead of her in broadcasting, 
and her appearance and demeanor will not limit her 
exclusively to radio.  Her quick adaptive skills and the way 
she puts her guests instantly at ease - while really teeing 
them up for the hard questions she is about to ask - will 
serve her well in years to come in whatever opportunities 
she chooses to accept. 
We believe that an IVLP at this early point in her very 
promising career would offer her the opportunity to see the 
United States from the American perspective, giving her a 
fresh take on the many issues that are important to U.S. 
interests in Manitoba and Canada.
