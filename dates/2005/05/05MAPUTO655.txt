¶1. On March 24, poloff delivered reftel demarche to Ilidio 
Caifaz, Director of National Studies, Ministry of Labor. 
Caifaz stated he would share the talking points with the 
Minister of Labor in their meeting later this week, but gave 
no indication of which candidate the GRM would support should 
the issue come to vote at the upcoming International Labor 
Conference in Geneva. 
 
¶2. Comment: At the recent AU Labor Affairs Commission meeting 
in Pretoria, the majority's view was to support Cuba's 
candidacy (ref A). Mozambique traditionally votes along AU 
lines and there is little indication that the practice would 
change with this vote. Mozambique also maintains close ties 
with Cuba. Minister of Foreign Affairs Abreu is currently in 
Havana for the intergovernmental meetings aimed at further 
strengthening bilateral relations between the two countries.
