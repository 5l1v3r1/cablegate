The Ministry of Foreign Affairs - the Deputy Assistant 
Minister for International Political Relations and 
Disarmament - gives its best regards to the American Embassy 
in Cairo and informs it that Egypt has submitted its 
nomination to run again for membership of the UNESCO 
Executive Council for the period 2005-2009.  UNESCO 
membership elections will take place during the 33rd session 
of the General Conference scheduled for October 3-21, 2005. 
 
Egypt was among UNESCO,s 37 founding countries in 1945 and 
one of the first 20 countries that signed its charter that 
was implemented on November 4, 1946.  The unique identity and 
diversity of Egyptian culture helped Egypt play a positive 
and constructive role in directing the activities of the 
organization by way of its membership on the Executive 
Council, enabling Egypt to maintain its membership since the 
establishment of UNESCO with the exception of only one period. 
 
In light of Egypt,s efforts to maintain good cooperation and 
relations among the member states with the aim of energizing 
the organization,s activities and programs related to the 
culture of peace, dialogue, and harmony among cultures and 
civilizations, we therefore look forward to your 
government,s support for Egypt's nomination for membership 
on the Council. 
 
Formal diplomatic closing.
