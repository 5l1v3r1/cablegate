Post delivered reftel demarche April 15 to the New Zealand 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT).  On May 23, 
Michelle McGillivray of MFAT's United Nations and 
Commonwealth Division reported that New Zealand would be 
unable to resettle any of the Cuban and Haitian migrants 
being housed at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo.  New 
Zealand takes in 750 refugees a year through its 
resettlement program with UNHCR.  That program does not 
include a humanitarian category or any flexibility allowing 
New Zealand to depart from the refugee quota.  The country 
takes direction from the UNHCR office in Canberra on the 
refugees it resettles.
