¶2.   DAILY SPANISH PRESS OF MAY 7, 2005 REPORTED THAT 
  THE SPANISH NATIONAL COURT SENTENCED THE ALLEGED ETA 
  ACTIVISTS REFERENCED BELOW TO 2,775 YEARS OF PRISON FOR 
  PLACING A 28 AND A 25 KILOGRAM-BOMBS ON A TRAIN TO 
  EXPLODE ONCE IT ARRIVED AT MADRID'S CHAMARTIN, RAILWAY 
  STATION ON CHRISTMAS EVE IN 2003.  THEY BOTH MANAGED TO 
  PLACE A SUITCASE AND A BACKPACK CONTAINING THE BOMBS 
  AND LATER ABANDONED THE TRAIN.  THEY WERE BOTH DETAINED 
  LATER AND THE BOMBS WERE DEACTIVATED.  COURT SUMMARY 
  REFUSED DEFENSE ALLEGATIONS AND CONCLUDED THAT ALTHOUGH 
  EXPLOSIVES WERE SET TO EXPLODE AFTER ALL PASSENGERS HAD 
  LEFT THE TRAIN, THE RISK OF AN PREMATURE EXPLOSION WAS 
  HIGH AND WOULD HAVE CAUSED A MASSACRE.
