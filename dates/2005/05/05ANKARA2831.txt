¶2. (SBU) MFA Disarmament and Arms Control officer M. Selcuk 
Sancar called in PolMilOff on May 17 to inform us that the 
GOT is requesting one additional change to the draft CFE Host 
Country Agreement Text.  Sancar reported that the MFA's legal 
department has determined that an exchange of diplomatic 
notes does not meet Turkey's legal requirements.  After the 
exchange of notes, Sancar explained, MFA would then need to 
seek approval from the Council of Ministers before the 
agreement can go into effect.  She anticipated this would not 
be controversial. 
 
¶3. (SBU) PolMilOff reminded Sancar--who has been in her 
position for only two weeks--that according to our records we 
have been negotiating this agreement with Turkey since 2002, 
and that the GOT had already to this point twice asked for 
revisions which the Department has accommodated.  Will this 
be Turkey's final revision, he asked.  Sancar acknowledged 
the point, and said that as far as she knew Turkey would not 
ask for any further revisions to the draft agreement. 
 
¶4. (SBU) To cover Turkey's legal requirements, MFA proposes 
the following revision to paragraph IV of the agreement: 
 
BEGIN TEXT: 
 
...constitute an agreement between the two Governments which 
shall enter into force on the date of the later of the notes 
by which the Parties inform each other that the legal 
requirements necessary for entry into force have been 
completed and shall remain in force so long as the covered 
equipment or facilities shall no longer be located in the 
territory of the Republic of Turkey. 
 
END TEXT 
 
¶5. (U) Please advise if we can accommodate the Turks' request 
for this revision.
