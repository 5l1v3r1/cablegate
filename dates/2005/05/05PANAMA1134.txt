¶1. (SBU) ON MONDAY, MAY 23, THE FIRST ROUND OF DEBATES IN 
PANAMA'S NATIONAL ASSEMBLY CONTINUED AMID ROWDY, MAINLY 
STUDENT-LED DEMONSTRATIONS IN PRINCIPAL STREETS OF THE CITY, 
AND AT LEAST 70 ARRESTS.  POLICE REPORTED STUDENTS WERE 
CARRYING KNIVES, MOLOTOV COCKTAILS, PLIERS, AND PETARDS. 
SOME WORE MASKS.  CURRENTLY, THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY HAS NO 
PLANS TO ASK FOR A SECOND TEN-DAY ROUND OF DEBATES FOR THE 
REFORM PACKAGE PRESENTED BY THE RULING DEMOCRATIC 
REVOLUTIONARY PARTY (PRD MEANING THE SOCIAL SECURITY (CSS) 
REFORMS COULD BE PASSED IN THE PRD-CONTROLLED ASSEMBLY THIS 
WEEK.  PANAMENISTA PARTY POLITICIANS HAVE INFORMED EMBASSY 
PERSONNEL THAT THE ASSEMBLY WILL MOST LIKELY PASS THE PACKAGE 
WITH ONLY MINOR CHANGES, AND WITH LITTLE OR NO OPPOSITION 
INPUT.  PANAMENISTA MANUEL GRIMALDO VOICED CONCERN THAT 
OPPOSITION, LABOR, AND CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS WERE NOT 
BEING CONSULTED IN THE DEBATE SESSIONS, JUST AS THEY HAD 
FEARED.  GRIMALDO ATTENDED SESSIONS SUNDAY, MAY 22, DURING 
WHICH NEITHER HEALTH MINISTER ALLEYNE NOR CSS DIRECTOR 
GENERAL LUCIANI WERE PRESENT.  LUCIANI SENT HIS SECRETARY 
GENERAL INSTEAD.  GRIMALDO ALSO SAID THAT PRD LABOR COMMITTEE 
CHAIRMAN LEANDRO AVILA HAS PRIVATELY TOLD THE OPPOSITION HE 
WAS CONFIDENT THE REFORMS WILL PASS. 
 
¶2. (U) MEDIA COVERAGE OF THE DEMONSTRATIONS, WHICH WERE 
SMALLER THAN EXPECTED, HAS BEEN SENSATIONALIST, HOWEVER, 
STUDENTS, POLICE, AND A REPORTER DID SUFFER MINOR INJURIES. 
THE MINISTRY OF GOVERNMENT AND JUSTICE AND NATIONAL POLICE 
HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE THIS AFTERNOON TO APPEAL FOR 
DIALOGUE.  THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION ALSO CANCELED CLASSES AT 
THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE, THE SCHOOL FROM WHICH MOST OF THE 
STUDENTS INCITING DEMONSTRATIONS CAME. 
 
¶3. (U) POST HAS ISSUED A WARDEN MESSAGE, AND THERE HAVE BEEN 
NO DISRUPTIONS IN EMBASSY OPERATIONS.  POST WILL PROVIDE 
UPDATES AS WEEK'S EVENTS UNFOLD.
