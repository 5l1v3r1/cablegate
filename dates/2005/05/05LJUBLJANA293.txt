SUBJECT: SLOVENIA AND IRAQ ESTABLISH DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS 
 
¶1.  (U) Following a decision reached at its 28 April session, 
the GoS issued a joint statement with the Government of Iraq 
on 29 April announcing that the Slovenian and Iraqi PermReps 
to the UN had exchanged notes establishing diplomatic 
relations.  According to MFA Iraq Desk Officer Beti Likar, 
the GoS is currently discussing whether to cover bilateral 
relations with Iraq from either a third country or its UN 
Mission.  There has been no discussion to date about opening 
a Slovenian Embassy in Baghdad.  Press reports indicate that 
the GoS hoped to resume Slovenia's strong business 
cooperation with Iraq that existed before the UN embargo took 
effect and dates back to the days of strong cooperation 
between Iraq and Yugoslavia. 
 
¶2.  (U) Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel immediately and 
publicly welcomed the 28 April decision of the Iraqi 
Transitional National Assembly to confirm Prime Minister 
Ibrahim al-Ja'afari's Iraqi Transitional Government. 
 
¶3.  (U) Minimize considered.
