REF: STATE 82983 
 
(SBU) PolOff delivered Reftel talking points to MFA Human 
Rights Director Janio Tunion and Deputy International 
Organizations and Commissions Director Nubia Lezcano on May 
5, stressing how the working group would undercut existing 
treaties.  Speaking unofficially with PolOff on May 6, Tunion 
said that the GOP is aware that funding redundant and 
"excessive" studies and working groups that develop no 
positive or concrete results would waste scarce OAS 
resources.  He said he would pass the talking points to his 
superiors.  Embassy will report any further developments to 
Department.
