Polmiloff discussed reftel points with Marc Versteden (Senior 
Policy Officer, Security Policy Department, MFA) October 4. 
Versteden noted -- as indicated by the demarche points -- 
that the Netherlands has pledged funds to the NATO-PfP Trust 
Fund project to help Ukraine destroy its excess munitions, 
small arms and light weapons.  As such, the Netherlands is 
concerned about the delay in implementation.  He planned to 
discuss further action with his colleagues in the MFA's Arms 
Control and Arms Export Policy Division.  Post will provide 
updates as necessary.
