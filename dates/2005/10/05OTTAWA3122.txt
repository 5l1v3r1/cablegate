¶1. (SBU) POLMINCOUNS delivered reftel demarche to Middle East 
Director General Mark Bailey October 19.  Bailey said that 
Minister Pettigrew would not be able to attend the meeting in 
Bahrain because of the unstable political situation in Canada 
but Deputy Minister Harder would attend in his place. 
 
¶2. (SBU) With regard to a possible Canadian contribution to 
the Foundation, Bailey said that his office would be 
receiving some money from the Global Peace and Security Fund 
launched through the International Policy Statement.  This is 
money that Foreign Affairs will control independent of CIDA. 
As it is the first year this has been done there is no model 
for how the funding should be used, but Bailey assumes there 
will be stiff competition for limited funds.  He said they 
would make the pitch for a contribution to the Foundation but 
emphasized that if successful the amount would be in the 
thousands not millions.  He also did not believe that they 
would make the October 24 deadline, but did think that they 
would have something positive to announce prior to or at the 
meeting.  Bailey asked for any more detailed information than 
what was contained in the demarche on specific amounts other 
G-8 members were contributing.
