¶1.  On October 17, we received a fax transmittal of a letter 
from President Toledo and President Uribe to President Bush 
regarding the subsequent conclusion of the U.S.-Andean FTA 
negotiations.  Presidents Toledo and Uribe have instructed 
their negotiators to quickly conclude negotiations.  As 
such, they propose that during the Summit of the Americas in 
Mar del Plata next month, President Bush, along with 
Presidents Toledo and Uribe, could announce the culmination 
of the FTA negotiations.

Mr. President 
George W. Bush 
 
Dear Mr. President: 
 
The negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement between the 
United States and the three Andean beneficiaries of ATPDEA, 
a mechanism of solidarity that favors the Andean region in 
its fight against narcotrafficking, has progressed 
satisfactorily.  The negotiations have already matured from 
the technical point of view; it is clear that the 
negotiations have advanced to their conclusion.  With a firm 
political compromise, we have instructed our negotiators to 
conclude this agreement.  We appreciate that you will 
instruct your negotiators to do the same. 
 
The sides have made reciprocal concession, enabling us to 
conclude a majority of the issues.  Nevertheless, we 
recognize that several pending issues remain.  To resolve 
them, it would require our determined political will.   Only 
in that way, we will find a satisfactory solution for the 
pending agricultural, intellectual property and biodiversity 
issues. 
 
The Summit of the Americas, which will occur in Mar del 
Plata next month, would be a favorable location to announce 
together to the Governments of South America the culmination 
of the negotiations, giving a clear and fortunate signal of 
understanding between our countries. 
 
Sincerely and with affection, 
 
Alvaro Uribe Velez 
President of Colombia 
 
Alejandro Toledo 
President of Peru
