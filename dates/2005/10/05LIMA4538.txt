SUBJECT: DGAC WELCOMES FAA IASA REASSESSMENT 
 
REF: STATE 191200 
 
¶1.  As requested in Reftel, we met with Roberto Rodriguez, 
Director General of Civil Aviation, and Juan Crovetto, 
Director of Aviation Security, on October 20 to discuss the 
impending FAA International Aviation Safety Assessment 
(IASA) and deliver the letter from James Ballough. 
Rodriguez noted that he had been expecting an assessment, 
since Peru has faced some serious aviation issues, including 
the collapse of Drug Kingpin Fernando Zevallos' 
AeroContinente and the fatal TANS crash in September, since 
the last FAA IASA three years ago. 
 
¶2.  Rodriguez suggested that the week of December 5 would be 
the best time for the FAA assessment; it enables people to 
travel for the Thanksgiving holiday and allows the 
Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) to review the 
FAA's areas of concerns.  Rodriguez also highlighted that 
the DGAC requested a separate International Civil Aviation 
Organization (ICAO) audit to review the TANS crash. 
 
¶3.  Both Rodriguez and Crovetto will contact FAA Miami's 
office of International Inspections directly.  The DGAC is 
confident that Peru will maintain its Category I status.
