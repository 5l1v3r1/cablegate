¶1.  (SBU) Ministry of Oil Director General for Finance Radwan 
al-Sa'adi updated Emboffs October 30 on the status of Iraq's 
payment of some $900 billion in arrears to Turkish fuel 
exporters.  According to Radwan, the Ministries of Finance 
and Planning have both signed off on the release of $500 
million to pay the Turks.  The Ministry of Finance confirmed 
the release of these funds to us October 30.  Radwan said 
that the money should hit the account of JP Morgan in New 
York on Monday October 31.  (Note: We were not told which 
exporters were to be paid or in what percentage the creditors 
would be made whole.  End Note). 
 
¶2. (SBU) MinFin also confirmed the release of another $175 
million to pay non-Turkish suppliers, of which $150 million, 
according to the MoO officials, will go to pay the Kuwaiti 
company KPC.  MinFin confirmed the release but did not 
confirm that the suppliers identified by MoO would be those 
paid.  We will continue to track this issue.
