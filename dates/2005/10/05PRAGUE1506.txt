REF: A. STATE 188927 
 
     ¶B. STATE 188933 
 
¶1. (SBU) The Czechs intend to co-sponsor the UNGA resolution 
on Holocaust Remembrance (ref A), according to Jan Kara, 
Director of the Czech MFA UN Department. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Kara indicated that the Czechs are still examining 
the USG points (ref B) and consulting with other states on 
the UNGA resolutions that are biased against Israel.  The 
Czechs will, at a minimum, abstain again this year on all 
three resolutions, but Kara did not rule out a "no" vote. 
Kara indicated that the final Czech position will be heavily 
influenced by debate among EU members, and noted that to date 
no EU member has seen the draft text of any of the three 
resolutions.
