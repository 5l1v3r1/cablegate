SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED; PLEASE PROTECT ACCORDINGLY 
 
¶1. (SBU) A PEACEFUL BUT GROWING DEMONSTRATION BY SUDANESE 
REFUGEES HAS FORCED UNHCR TO CLOSE ITS OFFICE IN CAIRO.  WITH THE 
EXCEPTION OF THE REGIONAL REPRESENTATIVE, SAAD AL ATTAR, AND 
SEVERAL CRITICAL SECURITY PERSONNEL, STAFF-MEMBERS HAVE BEEN SENT 
HOME AND UNHCR HAS SENT OUT EMAILS ADVISING THAT THE OFFICE WILL 
NOT BE OPERATIONAL FOR THE TIME BEING. 
 
¶2. (SBU) ACCORDING TO PROTECTION OFFICER, INGE DE LANGHE, ABOUT 
50 DEMONSTRATORS TOOK UP POSITION IN A SMALL PARK NEAR UNHCR'S 
OFFICE WITH TENTS AND BANNERS LATE LAST WEEK.  DURING THE WEEKEND 
MORE ARRIVED AND WHEN REFCOORD VISITED THE SITE THIS MORNING, 
MONDAY, OCTOBER 10, THE CROWD HAD GROWN TO AROUND 1,000 WITH 
BUSLOADS CONTINUING TO ARRIVE.  THE DEMONSTRATION IS PEACEFUL 
WITH ALMOST A PICNIC ATMOSPHERE.  EGYPTIAN POLICE ARE STANDING BY 
BUT SEEM QUITE RELAXED ABOUT THE SITUATION.  THIS IS IN MARKED 
CONTRAST TO THE VIOLENT RIOT STAGED BY SUDANESE IN AUGUST LAST 
YEAR (SEPTEL) WHEN REFUGEES ATTACKED THE UNHCR OFFICE INJURING 
SEVERAL POLICE AND CAUSING CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE. 
 
¶3. (SBU) ACCORDING TO DE LANGHE, UNHCR BELIEVES THE SUDANESE ARE 
RECENT ARRIVALS FROM THE SOUTH (NOT DARFUR).  THEY ARE NOT 
REGISTERED OR RECOGNIZED REFUGEES AND SEEM TO BE QUITE WELL 
ORGANIZED WITH WELL-CRAFTED BANNERS CRITICIZING UNHCR'S DECISION 
TO CEASE REFUGEE STATUS DETERMINATIONS (RSDS) FOR SUDANESE IN 
JUNE 2004 AND OPPOSING REPATRIATION.  SOME OF THE BANNERS DEMAND 
THIRD COUNTRY RESETTLEMENT.  UNHCR MET FOR AN ENTIRE DAY WITH THE 
SUDANESE OVER THE WEEKEND BUT FAILED TO DEFUSE THE DEMONSTRATION. 
 
¶4. (SBU) IT IS UNCLEAR WHO IS ORGANIZING THE DEMONSTRATION BUT IT 
HAS INVOLVED SOME CAREFUL PLANNING WITH THE PROVISION OF BUSES, 
TENTS, FOOD AND NUMEROUS BANNERS. UNHCR BELIEVES THE SITUATION IS 
BEING FUELED BY THE APPARENT EASE WITH WHICH SUDANESE ASYLUM 
SEEKERS CAN OBTAIN VISAS TO COME TO CAIRO. 
 
¶5. (SBU) UNHCR FEARS THAT THE SUDANESE ARE PREPARING FOR A LONG 
SIEGE AND IF THE NUMBERS KEEP GROWING THE EGYPTIAN AUTHORITIES 
WILL FEEL COMPELLED TO TAKE COUNTERMEASURES. 
 
¶6. (U) KHARTOUM MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.
