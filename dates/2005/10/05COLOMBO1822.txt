On October 18, poloff delivered Reftel demarche to Sumedha 
Ekanayake, Assistant Director of UN and Multilateral Affairs 
at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA).  Ekanayake said 
that Sri Lankan diplomats in the UN were frustrated with 
these obsolete bodies, (NOTE: Sri Lanka chairs the Special 
Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the 
Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the 
Occupied Territories).  Ekanayake noted, however, while the 
Government of Sri Lanka (GSL) will not obstruct a consensus, 
it would not take the lead in abolishing the committees due 
to Sri Lanka's membership in the Non-Aligned Movement and its 
relations with Arab capitals.  Enanayake suggested the US try 
to build support among moderate Arab countries, like Egypt.
