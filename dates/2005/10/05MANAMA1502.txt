REF: STATE 189518 
 
Ambassador delivered reftel letter from Secretary Gutierrez 
on the UNESCO Cultural Diversity Convention to Minister of 
Industry and Commerce Hassan Fakhro during a meeting on 
October 17.  Fakhro said that Bahrain was sympathetic to our 
viewpoint, but that in the face of such a vast majority in 
favor of the resolution, it would be politically very 
difficult for Bahrain to stand against the GCC/Arab League 
consensus.  But, he added, if a certain number of countries 
moved toward postponement, Bahrain would have no objection to 
supporting that position.
