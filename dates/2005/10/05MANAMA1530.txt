¶1.  (SBU) Pol/Econ chief October 19 delivered Ref A urgent 
demarche on the UNESCO cultural diversity convention vote to 
MFA Director for International Organization Affairs Ghassan 
Shaikho.  Shaikho said his office was currently in the midst 
of contacts with the Bahraini mission in Paris and GCC and 
Arab delegations concerning the vote.  Bahrain had not yet 
decided how it was going to vote.  He welcomed the concept of 
expressing Bahrain's concerns about the possible impact of 
the convention on international trade and the free flow of 
information in Bahrain's explanation of vote, to be issued 
either before or after the vote. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Shaikho emphasized that Bahrain shares the United 
States' concerns about possible UNESCO interference in trade 
issues.  According to his information, the United States 
viewed the matter as a trade issue whereas the other side 
viewed it as a response to globalization and the protection 
of local cultures.  He thought the U.S. was at a disadvantage 
because it had entered the debate only after the draft text 
of the convention had been issued.  He thought there might be 
some "constructive ambiguity" in the text of the convention 
that could work either for or against the U.S. position, 
depending upon the interpretation of those charged with 
implementing it.
