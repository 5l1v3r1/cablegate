¶1.  (SBU) The ongoing suffering in Pakistan struck a deep 
chord in Turkey, leading to a broad outpouring of public 
interest and support for contributing to the earthquake 
relief effort, epitomized by Prime Minister Erdogan's October 
20 visit to the affected area, during which he pledged $150 
million in Turkish support.  Turkey feels a deep solidarity 
with Pakistan's tragedy, given its own vulnerability to 
earthquakes and a long special relationship between the two 
countries.  The campaign has resonated with street banners 
and television commercials urging public participation. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) MFA Official Sebnem Incesu highlighted Turkey's 
participation in the Geneva donor conference (Minister of 
State and Deputy PM Mehmet Ali Sahin) and the strong action 
and pledges that resulted from Erdogan's visit to Pakistan. 
The $150 million pledge covers both humanitarian assistance 
and reconstruction, pushing it to the head of the list of 
international donors in dollar terms.  Incesu said that while 
some details of this pledge had not yet been fleshed out in 
detail, bilateral assistance disbursed to date totaled $52 
million, including significant citizen contributions. 
According to the MFA official, Turkey had sent to Pakistan 
over 200 people as part of medical and rescue teams and a 
total of 54 tons of relief materials, including medical 
equipment, medicine, 1,500 tents, and 44,000 blankets. The 
GOT has sent 15 military and 3 civilian planes-loads of 
supplies.  The GOT has also coordinated assistance from the 
Red Crescent, universities, and other NGO's.   The GOT has 
set up one field hospital.  In addition, the GOT is shippping 
50,000 tons of flour in 3 ships to Pakistan. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) According to the MFA rep, the GOT will announce a 
response to the special UN flash appeal in an amount of $2.75 
million to be contributed to UN affiliated organizations. 
MFA also pointed out Turkey's contribution to the NATO 
airlift from Incirlik Air Base (Ref B).  Turkey provided land 
shipment capacity (40 trucks) from Iskenderun port and two of 
19 NATO planes assuring the air bridge.
