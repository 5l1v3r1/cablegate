SUBJECT: BRAZIL: URGENT DEMARCHE ON UNESCO CULTURAL 
DIVERSITY CONVENTION 
 
REF: A) STATE 189518, B) STATE 184292 
 
¶1. On October 14 post forwarded (Ref A) correspondence from 
Secretary Rice, under cover of a letter from the Ambassador, 
 
SIPDIS 
to Foreign Minister Celso Amorim.  To date, we have not 
received a response from the GOB.  Similarly, on October 17 
post forwarded Ref B letter from Secretary Gutierrez, under 
cover of a letter from Ambassador Danilovich, to 
Development, Industry and Trade (MDIC) Minister Luis Furlan. 
Again, to date, we have not received a response from the 
Brazilian government to this second letter. 
 
¶2. Mission FCS officers have raised the matter of the UNESCO 
Cultural Diversity Convention with business counterparts in 
both Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.  In general, our private 
sector interlocutors have pled ignorance of this issue and 
directed us to either the Ministry of Culture or MDIC. 
Notwithstanding our efforts, the UNESCO Convention remains a 
low-profile issue within Brazil.
