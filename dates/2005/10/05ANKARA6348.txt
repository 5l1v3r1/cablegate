¶1. (U) Poloff delivered ref demarches on the Holocaust 
Remembrance Resolution as well opposing anti-Israel bias to 
Turkish MFA Middle East department officer Cagri Sakar on 
October 20. 
 
Holocaust Resolution -- Israel Gives Turkey an "Out" 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Concerning the Holocaust Remembrance Resolution, 
Sakar said Foreign Minister Gul had spoken to Israeli FM 
Shalom on the margins of the UNGA.  Shalom reportedly asked 
Gul for Turkey's support on the resolution, but also said 
that Israel "would understand" if Turkey is not able to do 
so.  Speaking personally, Sakar suggested that, had Shalom 
made a firmer approach to Gul, the Turkish MFA would have 
already decided to co-sponsor the resolution.  With Shalom 
perceived as having given Turkey an "out," however, the MFA 
is now taking its time to consider the consequences of 
co-sponsorship.  Sakar said the issue is currently on FM 
Gul's desk for decision. 
 
Anti-Israel Bias:  To be Decided, Prospects not Good 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) On anti-Israel bias, Sakar admitted he had not 
followed the matter but undertook to report to the highest 
level our hope for a Turkish "no" vote or, at minimum, 
abstention/absence.  Again speaking personally, Sakar said 
Turkey had long supported the Palestinians, even through the 
three UN bodies, and would probably continue to do so absent 
dramatic progress in the Middle East Peace Process.  He did, 
however, ask about the position of EU countries.  Poloff 
noted that none had voted "yes" last year.  (Note. As an EU 
candidate country, Turkey appears to be in the process of 
aligning its positions with those of the EU.  End note.) 
 
¶4. (U) Post will follow up and report final GOT decisions on 
these issues as they are reached.
