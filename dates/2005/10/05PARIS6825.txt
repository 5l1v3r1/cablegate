SUBJECT: AUSTRALIA MULLS OVER AMBASSADORIAL ACCREDITATION 
TO MAURITANIA 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Australia is looking for signs of progress toward 
democracy since the August coup in Nouakchott in order to 
justify the accreditation of its ambassador in France to 
Mauritania, Second Secretary Tracey Haines informed Africa 
Watcher on October 4.  Australian ambassador Penny Wensley, 
who began her tenure in France in March, has yet to present 
her credentials in Nouakchott.  (Note:  Australia covers 
Algeria, Mauritania, and Morocco from Paris.)  In the 
aftermath of the coup, Haines said there was concern that 
moving forward could send the wrong signal. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) At the same time, Haines said, Australia has 
ongoing consular and commercial concerns.  Woodside, the 
largest oil and gas production company in Australia, is near 
completion of a $1 billion oil project at the Chinguetti 
field, estimated to contain 123 million barrels of oil, 
according to a 9/21 report in "The Australian" provided by 
Haines.  She tallied Australians in Mauritania at 45, but 
said their numbers would soon double.  Woodside would host a 
"First Barrel" ceremony in February 2006 and was expecting a 
formal government presence, Haines said. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) As Canberra mulls over ambassadorial accreditation, 
Haines said she would welcome USG updates, as appropriate, on 
the Mauritanian situation.
