¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  MFA U/S for Multilateral Affairs Mauricio 
Montalvo told DCM and PolChief that the GOE may be open to 
voting in favor of an Israeli-sponsored holocaust resolution, 
but that it would be more difficult to change its votes on 
other anti-Israeli resolutions.  He expressed appreciation 
and agreement with our points on both issues and suggested 
USUN contact the Ecuadorian mission to discuss the holocaust 
resolution.  End Summary. 
 
Holocaust Resolution 
-------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Without firmly committing the GOE, Montalvo agreed 
that Ecuador might be able to support a holocaust resolution. 
 Doing so would be made easier by the fact that the 
resolution was new, and could therefore be treated on the 
merits.  For more on Ecuador's position on Israel's Holocaust 
resolution, Montalvo suggested USUN contact Ecuador's new 
Ambassador to the UN, Diego Cordovez.  As one of Ecuador's 
most senior diplomats, Montalvo implied, Cordovez will have 
considerable latitude to influence the GOE's position on the 
issue. 
 
Anti-Israel Bias 
---------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Montalvo agreed with our view that many anti-Israel 
resolutions in various UN fora are a distraction. 
Nevertheless, it would hard to change Ecuador's established 
position on the resolutions (in favor of the Palestinian 
cause), he said.  Doing so would open the GOE to criticism at 
a sensitive time.  We urged Montalvo rise above traditional 
posturing to do the right thing.  He was noncommittal, saying 
much will depend on the views of FM Carrion, a personal 
friend. 
 
Bio note on Diego Cordovez 
-------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Cordovez served in the Ecuadorian foreign service 
until 1963, when he joined the UN, serving first in UNCTAD 
and later in ECOSOC.  As UN U/S for Political Affairs 1981-88 
he was involved in mediation of the Iran-Iraq war and 
Afghanistan.  He served as Foreign Minister under President 
Rodrigo Borja (1988-92) and subsequently tried but failed to 
win the UN SecGen position in 1992.  He later served as UN 
special advisor and  to resolve conflicts in Libya-Malta, 
Cyprus, and Venezuela, and practiced international law in New 
York.  Cordovez was a failed vice presidential candidate 
(with Guayaquil Social Christian party mayor Jaime Nebot) in 
¶1996.
