¶1.  (SBU) Pol/Econ chief October 2 delivered reftel demarche 
concerning the U.S. UNGA First Committee resolution on 
compliance to MFA Director for International Organization 
Affairs Ghassan Shaikho.  Shaikho said that Bahrain supports 
all non-proliferation goals and objectives, including the 
declaration of a Middle East WMD-free zone.  The Arab 
countries coordinate closely on non-proliferation issues and 
are concerned about Israel's lack of compliance.  He pledged 
to relay the demarche to the Foreign Minister and the 
Bahraini Mission in New York. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Shaikho said that if the U.S. called for adoption 
of the resolution without a formal vote, as was the case with 
the 2003 resolution, Bahrain would support it without 
question.  In the case of a vote, however, the issue became 
more problematic and would require coordination with other 
Arab countries.
