SUBJECT: PHILIPPINE MARINES CAPTURE SEVEN ASG TERRORISTS ON 
TAWI-TAWI 
 
¶1.  (U) In a September 21 early morning raid on a safe house 
in Panjogan village near Bongao, Tawi-Tawi, Philippine 
Marines captured Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) commander Jundan 
Jamalu, a.k.a. Jundan Jain a.k.a. "Black Killer," and six 
other ASG terrorists.  Jamalu had been wanted by Philippine 
authorities for his role in the April 2004 kidnapping of 
three Indonesian sailors from a Malaysian-registered tugboat 
off Sabah.  (Note: Jamalu is also on the US Department of 
Defense's Rewards list for his terrorist activities.  End 
Note.) 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Comment: Jamalu's arrest highlights the role of 
Tawi-Tawi, the southernmost island of the Sulu Archipelago, 
as a terrorist transit point and safe haven.  One of the 
original Dos Palmas kidnappers, ASG terrorist Toting Craft 
Hanno, who was recaptured by the Armed Forces of the 
Philippines in January 2005, also found refuge in Tawi-Tawi 
after escaping from Basilan prison in April 2004.
