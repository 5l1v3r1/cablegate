GOF OFFERS of AID 
----------------- 
 
¶2.  France announced on September 2 it is willing to provide 
disaster relief assistance to the United States to help the 
victims of Hurricane Katrina.  Initial proposals included: 
 
--Interior Ministry capabilities: an emergency services 
detachment of 35 people (including 11 hurricane specialists) 
can be immediately deployed from Guadeloupe and Martinique. 
An airmobile disaster intervention detachment of up to 60 
people can also be mobilized from continental France. 
 
--The Foreign Ministry pre-positioned humanitarian action 
supplies in Martinique, including 600 tents, almost 1000 camp 
beds, 60 generators, 3 motor pumps, 3 water treatment units 
and 1000 foldable jerry cans. 
 
-- The Defense Ministry can make available 2 aircraft which 
are already in the area and another six from continental 
France, 2 navy ships (one with a helicopter) and a hurricane 
unit specialized in medical support. 
 
-- The Telecom sans frontiers NGO and the French water 
company Veolia Environment Company offered services in their 
areas of expertise, namely, restoring telephone and water 
links. 
 
¶3.  On September 4, we met with representatives of the French 
disaster response team (which includes representatives from 
the Foreign Ministry, Defense, Interior, and the Presidency), 
and shared with them the points provided in Ref B.  The 
French provided further specifications of their offers of 
material assistance, at our request, as follows: 
 
143  tents 25m2 
146  tents 13m3

Subsequently, the French MFA indicated it also has available 
1000 MRE rations.  We faxed the detailed list to the Task 
Force. 
 
¶4.  During the meeting, French officials indicated they also 
would coordinate their offers with the European Commission 
Civil Protection Cooperation Mechanism (ECCPM).  (NOTE: 
French officials provided a copy of a message from the ECCPCM 
to us, with a list of urgent requirements in two tables.  It 
appears the second table is almost verbatim from Ref B, with 
the exception that pharmaceuticals are listed as being 
requested, not excluded.  END NOTE.) 
 
¶5.  The GOF indicated that it has planes ready to go in 
Guadeloupe and Martinique with disaster supplies; their 
pilots just need to know a destination.  The French also 
would like to know exactly what to send, and sought 
confirmation of our priorities.  Delivery can be by air or 
sea, but by sea will take a few days longer.  French 
officials repeated their offer to provide trained personnel. 
These specialists would be fully autonomous (e.g., have 
enough food and water) for up to five days.  The French Red 
Cross stated their contacts with the US Red Cross indicated 
the greatest need is for medical personnel. 
 
¶6.  We checked by phone with the Task Force, and relayed the 
message that the USG priority now is for material supplies, 
not personnel.  We also relayed the message to the French 
that search & rescue personnel are not required.  The French 
suggested that they could also provide personnel to aid in 
the distribution of goods, if desired.

PRIVATE OFFERS 
-------------- 
 
¶7.  In addition to the French Telecom NGO and Veolia, the GOF 
informs us that Airbus is willing to make available, as soon 
as September 6, its Beluga cargo carrier.  In addition, the 
Groupe de Secours Catastrophe Francais has offered to send a 
team of 5-15 persons to engage in water purification of up to 
1500 liters per hour and to provide sanitary support.  POC is 
Thierry Velu, tel  336 63 58 0195, fax  333 21907 932, email 
secretaire@gscf.fr.  The Corps Mondiale de Secours, another 
 
SIPDIS 
NGO specializing in search & rescue, has also offered its 
services. POC is Camille Chardon, tel.  336 19 98 45. 
 
¶8.  We have referred other offers to FEMA and the Task Force 
for consideration, as well as to the Embassy website, which 
has contact information for donations. 
 
--------------- 
CONSULAR ISSUES 
--------------- 
¶9.  Francoise le Bihan, Assistant Secretary for French 
Consular Services, expressed concern to us about the plight 
of EU members in the wake of the storm, particularly of 
course French citizens.  She requested, if possible, to have 
EU citizens grouped together for easier handling.  She 
reported the French ConGen in New Orleans had been relocated 
to Lafayette, but soon would move to Baton Rouge.  Other 
French consulates, such as in Houston, are also involved in 
providing aid. 
 
---------- 
ACCEPTANCE 
---------- 
¶10.  We relayed the USG acceptance to the French of the tents 
and generators (ref D).  The GOF took note, and requested 
destination information soonest.  In order to fuel the planes 
properly, that is the most important piece of information 
missing.  The GOF also awaits further notification on its 
other offers of aid, specifically the personnel proffered.
