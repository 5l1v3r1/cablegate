¶1.  According to Pablo Muelas Garcia, Technical Advisor in 
AECI (the Spanish USAID equivalent), two Spanish Hercules 
transport aircraft are scheduled to depart Spain tomorrow 
(September 7) with material assistance from the Spanish 
Government (reftel A.)  As currently planned, one plane will 
contain MREs and the second a compendium of items from our 
list (reftel B), including tents, bedding, cleaning items, 
water purification plants, and basic medical supplies. 
Muelas also asked for status of an earlier Spanish request 
for U.S. airlift.  We had turned the request off because of 
the availability of the Spanish Hercules.  He stated he had 
just returned from a meeting with NGOs and the governments 
of Spain's autonomous communities (state equivalents.)  He 
estimated that between the two, there could be three further 
planeloads of supplies to transport.  He did not yet have 
details on the supplies or timing. 
 
¶2.  Madrid's Air Attache is coordinating the U.S. airlift 
request, as well as the travel of the Spanish Hercules 
aircraft.  We are also waiting for confirmation from OFDA on 
landing slots for the Spanish aircraft in Little Rock 
(information promised for later tonight.) 
 
¶3.  Embassy Madrid is receiving a large volume of calls from 
Spaniards wishing to provide assistance to victims of 
Hurricane Katrina.  We are steering them to the Spanish Red 
Cross, which has a telephone number dedicated to these 
donations.
