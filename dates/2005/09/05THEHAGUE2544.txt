Begin Text 
 
Dear Mr. Schofer, 
 
I would like to thank you for your letter dated August 25 and 
attached memorandum, providing an explanation regarding the 
Euro 300,000 granted by the government of the Kingdom of the 
Netherlands in December 2003 towards the setting up of an 
Iraqi National Bureau of Missing Persons (POBB8817). 
 
As you indicated in your letter, the money was returned by 
the Department of State to the Netherlands Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs.  I am pleased to confirm that the money was 
received this week.  Therefore, with this letter, this 
project has been closed. 
 
Please be aware that I share the regret as convey in the 
memorandum on the impossibility of carrying out this project 
as foreseen.  The very difficult circumstances in Iraq played 
no small role in this.  Both our governments are and remain 
committed to altering those circumstances for the benefit of 
the people of Iraq. 
 
With kind regards, 
Pim Dumore 
Director, Political Affairs Department 
For the Minister of Foreign Affairs
