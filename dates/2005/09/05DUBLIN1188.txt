¶1.  (C) Embassy Dublin has discussed the Irish/Colombia Three 
(ref A) with senior GOI officials on numerous occasions, 
including with Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Bertie Ahern on 
September 12 and Justice Minister Michael McDowell on 
September 10.  McDowell told the Ambassador that the GOI is 
investigating all its options, including whether new charges 
can be brought against the Three.  McDowell said that 
obstacles to extradition are legal, not political.  In a 
September 23 meeting with the Ambassador, Ministry of Justice 
Secretary General Sean Aylward said that Irish authorities 
 
SIPDIS 
had received the extradition request from Colombia (ref B). 
Noting that it was still in poor shape as an Irish legal 
document, he said the Ministry would "work on it."  Aylward 
thanked us for U.S. help facilitating the September 7 visit 
to Colombia of Garda officials.  He said the Irish government 
would seek to get information (such as Niall Connolly's false 
passport, reportedly in the Colombians' possession) to help 
make a case against one or more of the three in Ireland. 
Aylward said the meetings in New York between the Taoiseach 
and FM Ahern and the Colombian President and others "went 
well." 
 
¶2.  (C) Comment: The GOI was deeply embarrassed at the return 
of the Irish Three.  Their interest in finding a legal 
mechanism to deal with them is sincere, whether through new 
charges, extradition or having them serve their sentences in 
Ireland.  Of these three options, new charges for false use 
of an Irish passport would be most likely, depending on 
whether the Garda can produce evidence that would satisfy a 
prosecutor.  Post will continue to engage GOI officials.  End 
Comment.
