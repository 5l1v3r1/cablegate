SUBJECT: FRENCH TELECOM REGULATOR GRANTS IRIDIUM TEMPORARY 
AUTHORIZATION REQUEST 
 
REF: STATE 176979 
 
¶1.  On September 26, EconOff delivered reftel talking points 
to French Telecom Regulator ARCEP, which authorizes civilian 
use of radio frequencies in France.  ARCEP acknowledged that 
they had received the request for Iridium, but had not yet 
completed their review due to the temporary absence of a key 
frequencies expert.  EconOff reiterated the urgency of the 
request, given the extensive use of Iridium phones for 
hurricane disaster relief efforts in the U.S. 
 
¶2.  On September 28, Olivier Blondeau, the head of ARCEP's 
Frequencies Unit informed us of their positive reply to 
Iridium's request for temporary authorization.  ARCEP has 
extended of Iridium's current authorized use of the 1621.35- 
1626.5 MHz band to include the 1618.25-1621.35 MHz band for 
mobile services via satellite until December 31, 2005, on an 
exceptional basis, under the following two conditions:  (1) 
non-interference with the Globalstar network, and (2) 
protection of the radioastronomical site of Nancay in the 
Cher Department of France.
