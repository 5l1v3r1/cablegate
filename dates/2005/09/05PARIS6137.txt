¶1.  SUMMARY:  This is an action request, see para 14. 
France is still willing to provide further assistance, but 
awaits word from the USG as what else might be provided. 
The Ambassador, DCM, and other Embassy officials have 
publicly expressed thanks per ref B.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------ 
FRENCH GOVERNMENT OFFERS 
------------------------ 
¶2.  We have passed latest general acceptance cable to the 
GOF (ref C).  France continues to offer additional 
assistance, specifically 20 to 30,000 MREs.  These are 
located in Paris with the French Ministry of Defense, and 
are available for delivery within the next 2-3 days.  They 
can be flown using available Air France cargo space, meaning 
preferred destinations would be Houston or Atlanta.  Other 
arrangements could be made if another destination is better, 
such as Little Rock, but that could entail a delay of up to 
5 days in delivery.  One MRE contains 2 meals, with a 
caloric value of 3200 calories.  The total weight of the 
shipment would be 48 tons for the 30000 MREs. 
 
¶3.  France also has offered help with diving teams and the 
use of a tugboat.  We understand the Department will shortly 
send a message on formal acceptance, and we will immediately 
relay the message to the MFA upon receipt. 
 
¶4.  Our matrix on the status of French assistance, to date, 
is as follows:

PRIVATE ASSISTANCE 
------------------ 
¶5.  The French Red Cross made 12 logistical experts 
available to the US Red Cross. 
 
¶6.  The NGO Telecom Sans Frontiers sent a team to Houston on 
September 5 via commercial air to help restore telephone and 
communication links. 
 
¶7.  Air France informed us on September 6 that it is 
prepared to make cargo capacity available for French 
humanitarian relief shipments to the U.S.  Air France has 
frequent service to Atlanta and Houston, for example. 
 
¶8.  Representatives from the international oil company Total 
informed the Ambassador on September 6 that Total is 
pledging a donation of USD 1 million to the US Red Cross. 
 
¶9.  We have received innumerable offers of assistance from 
private French citizens, and are directing them to 
appropriate organizations in the US. 
 
---------------- 
PUBLIC DIPLOMACY 
---------------- 
¶10.  On September 3, Ambassador Stapleton conducted an 
interview about the hurricane with Le Parisien, the largest 
circulation (500,000) daily paper in Paris.  The interview, 
along with a photo of the Ambassador, appeared last 
Saturday.  On September 8, per guidance provided ref B, the 
Ambassador held a well-attended press conference to thank 
the GOF and the people of France for the aid that they have 
provided to date.  More than 20 journalists attended, and 
the results were immediate and positive.  Beginning last 
night with the AP and AFP wire services stories, five radio 
stations, a cable news TV station, and daily center-right 
newspaper Le Figaro all carried features based on the 
Ambassador's press conference remarks. 
 
¶11.  The DCM gave a live morning drive-time radio interview 
on September 6, emphasizing the resilience of the US and our 
thanks for French pledges of assistance. 
 
¶12.  Le Monde (center-left national daily) will publish 
Ambassador Stapleton's 9/11 anniversary op-ed in its Sunday- 
Monday weekend edition.  Entitled "Adversity and 
Friendship," the op-ed draws parallels between France's 
supportive response after 9/11 to its similar support and 
solidarity in Hurricane Katrina's wake. 
 
¶13.  We will continue to seize other opportunities for 
public and media outreach to reiterate our messages. 
 
¶14.  ACTION REQUESTED: Please provide further guidance on 
French offers of assistance, in particular the 20 to 30000 
MREs.
