¶1. (U) On 10 September 2005 at 1300 hours (Local) 
approximately 200 members of the Iraqi Turks Association, the 
Government Workers Union, the Labor Party, and Turkish Metal 
Workers Union, assembled on Kennedy Caddesi across from 
Embassy Ankara.  This planned demonstration was in support of 
Iraqi Turkmen and protested both U.S. and Turkish Justice and 
Development (AK) Party foreign policy in Northern Iraq.  A 
small group was allowed to place a black wreath in front of 
the Embassy's Main Gate with local press present.  The 
demonstrators dispersed at approximately 1345 hours. 
 
¶2. (U) The Turkish National Police deployed in sufficient 
numbers to contain the demonstration.  No arrests nor 
injuries were observed.  The Embassy's Surveillance Detection 
Team, Local Guard Force, and Marine Security Guards monitored 
the demonstration.
