SUBJECT:  Taiwan FSC Road Shows in October 2005 
 
¶1.  Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) will 
conduct road shows in New York and London in October 2005 to 
attract foreign investors to Taiwan.  Foreign investors will 
be encouraged to participate in merge & acquisition (M&A), 
and securities trading.  The major theme of the road shows 
will be focused on attracting foreign companies to list on 
Taiwan's new international board that the FSC plans to 
inaugurate in January 2006.  The FSC has set a goal to have 
20 foreign companies to list on the international board.  It 
particularly hopes to attract high-tech enterprises with 
potential for rapid growth.  The FSC will also encourage 
foreign companies to issue corporate bonds in Taiwan's 
market.  Trading in the market will not be subject to any 
capital gains tax although there is a securities transaction 
tax of 0.1%. 
 
¶2.  The road show in New York is scheduled for October 11 - 
15, and from there will go to London for another show. 
Euromoney will be the show's sponsor in New York.  The FSC 
road show delegation will be headed by FSC Chairman Kong Jaw- 
sheng and will also include:
