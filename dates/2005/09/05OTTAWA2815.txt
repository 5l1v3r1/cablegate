SUBJECT:   Mission Canada 90-Day Goal Tracker Application - 
Empowering Diplomacy Through Web Enabled Technology 
 
 
¶1.  Mission Canada is pleased to announce the launch of an 
innovative, locally developed, web-enabled application to 
track Mission 90-Day goals and progress. 
 
¶2.  The 90-Day Goal Tracker application provides Department 
and Mission managers with a snapshot of current Mission 
Canada goals, a graphical representation of the progress 
we're making in achieving those goals, a searchable archive 
of previous quarter goals, and a comprehensive report 
capability.  Additionally, the application contains a 
password-protected content management layer that enables 
goal coordinators to update goal details.  Plans are 
underway to expand the application to track Mission progress 
of MPP goals.  Additional details will be provided when the 
MPP module is available for use. 
 
¶3.  The 90-Day Goal Tracker dashboard is accessible from the 
Mission Canada home page http://ottawa.state.gov or directly 
via the following link: 
 
http://ottawa.state.gov/goals/default.asp 
 
¶4.  Bureau and Post personnel are invited to visit the site 
frequently to track quarterly Mission goals.  Requests for 
application passwords should be sent to the application 
administrator, IMO Ed Gagliardi (GagliardiEJ@state.gov) or 
to the application developer, Naveed Iqbal. 
(IqbalN@state.gov)  Note:  Passwords are only required for 
goal coordinators, not for read-only management access.
