(U) On August 23, Poloff spoke with Major Richard Reese, 
Commissioner of Corrections, Jamaica Department of 
Correctional Services (JDCS).  Reese confirmed his 
organization's export application for 140 automatic weapons 
for official use by the JDCS.  He explained that the JDCS is 
currently severely under-armed: the organization has 385 
non-functioning automatic Ruger Mini-14s that are "too old to 
repair," but can only afford to replace 140 of them.  Reese 
said that, as a stop-gap measure, he has purchased some 
shotguns for his guards, and has enlisted the help of the 
Jamaica Defense Force (JDF) in guarding the island's largest 
pre-trial remand center.  Reese added that the model of 
firearm that the JDCS uses is dictated by the Jamaica 
Constabulary Force (JCF), whose armory is used to repair JDCS 
weapons.  He said that the JDF also uses these particular 
weapons.  Reese added that he is grateful for U.S. assistance 
in this matter.
