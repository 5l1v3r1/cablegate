(SBU) Post delivered reftel demarche to MFA International 
Economic Affairs Office Director Amr Ramadan September 8. 
Ramadan, after reviewing the issue with his colleagues, 
responded to poloff September 12 that it was his 
understanding that the content of the demarche was no longer 
an issue, as the development document being negotiated in New 
York did not contain any of the elements pushed by Algeria, 
Brazil, Chile, France, Germany, or Spain.  Post also shared 
the text of reftel demarche with the Ministries of Finance, 
Trade, and Tourism.  No substantive reply was received on the 
demarche.
