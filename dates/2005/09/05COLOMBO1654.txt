¶1. (SBU) On September 16 poloff delivered Reftel A demarche 
to V. Krishnamoorthy, Director of UN and Multilateral Affairs 
at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Poloff followed up on 
September 20, when Krishnamoorthy responded that the 
Government of Sri Lanka (GSL) is "waiting to see" whether the 
matter can be resolved within the IAEA rather than sending a 
referral to the Security Council.  Krishnamoorthy added that 
the GSL has not/not yet decided what stance it will take on 
the referral issue.  In a separate September 20 conversation, 
Assistant Director of UN and Multilateral Affairs Sumedha 
Ekanayake told poloff that Sri Lanka has been strongly 
supportive of the EU on this issue.  He cited the late 
Foreign Minister Kadirgamar's telephone call expressing the 
EU's position to Iran's former Foreign Minister (Reftel C). 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: While our sources here did not directly 
confirm the Government of Japan's assessment (Reftel B), the 
GSL seems willing to support the US and EU positions on this 
issue; nevertheless, Sri Lanka's dependence on Iran's sale of 
oil at a concessional price is also a significant factor.
