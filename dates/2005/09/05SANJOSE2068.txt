On August 29, 2005, Econoff delivered talking points to 
Edwin Arias, Deputy Director for Foreign Policy in the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA).  Following is Embassy's 
informal translation of Arias' written comments:  "The 
process of coordinating and reaching consensus on the 
Declaration for the 4th Summit of the Americas is 
deliberate and sometimes long.  There are many countries 
party to this event and the central topic is complex.  A 
certain slowness is inherent in the Summit Implementation 
Review Group process because of the need to achieve 
consensus on the project.  We hope that the meeting in 
Buenos Aires in September will facilitate this process."
