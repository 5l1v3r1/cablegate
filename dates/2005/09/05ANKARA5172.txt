¶1.  (SBU) BTC Inauguration at Ceyhan: MFA DDG Energy Mithat 
Rende told Econ Counselor on September 2 that the GOT 
expected the BTC first oil tanker loading at Ceyhan to be 
scheduled for either mid December or March.  He said that 
BP's current forecast for BTC completion estimated end of 
December with risk of slippage if there were further delays 
in wrapping things up in Turkey.  Rende said that the MFA 
strongly opposed a "fake" ceremony; that is, using oil from 
tanker early commissioning, rather than oil that has in fact 
traversed the pipeline.  (Note: per Ref A the GOT Ministry of 
Energy still plans for post-Ramadan November 10, which 
appears disconnected from construction reality for a "real" 
ceremony.  The GOT has sought to nail down a date to 
facilitate high level visitors.  If first oil slipped past 
the new year, MFA appears to support aiming for better 
weather in March for the inauguration.  End Note.)  In a 
separate conversation with EnergyOff, BP confirmed the 
project timing, offering "odds on chance" of first oil before 
year-end.  The BP rep said that operation of only two of 
Turkey's four pump stations would be necessary for the 
initial start-up with reduced flow.  He noted that the latest 
delay was due to difficulties in completing the electronic 
and communication connections between Turkey pump stations 
and the Ceyhan control room.  Finally, the BP rep said that 
the first tanker from Supsa is scheduled to dock at Ceyhan on 
September 8 to fill up one tank for testing and 
pre-commission. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) BTC Security: The next step in arranging 
three-country security coordination and information 
mechanisms under the BTC Security Protocol is the convening 
of the Joint Committee on Security in Ankara (Ref B). 
According to Rende, the Georgians (heretofore slow in naming 
representatives) had agreed to September 5 (announced in the 
press), but unfortunately the Azeris said they could not meet 
on this date.  Rende said that the mutually satisfactory date 
remained to be determined.  He was sorry that he would not be 
able to attend the EUCOM Caspian Energy Security Conference 
in Garmisch September 26-28, but he said there would be good 
representation from GOT MFA, MENR, and BOTAS to discuss BTC 
security and other issues.
