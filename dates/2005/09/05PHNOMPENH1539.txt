     ¶B. PHNOM PENH 1522 
 
¶1.  On September 13, King Norodom Sihamoni conveyed to Charge 
and USAID Mission Director his profound condolences and those 
of King Father Norodom Sihanouk and Queen Mother Monineath 
for the destruction, suffering, and loss of life caused by 
Hurricane Katrina.  King Sihamoni then provided a cash 
donation of $20,000 on behalf of himself and his parents the 
King Father and Queen Mother to support the victims and 
recovery efforts.  Charge accepted the donation in principle. 
 
¶2.  In a moving statement, the King said that, as a young man 
studying in Prague, he had been touched by the influence of 
the culture of New Orleans and by the great American 
literature produced by southern writers.  He expressed his 
admiration for the efforts of the American people in dealing 
with the catastrophe and for the dignity of survivors.  He 
apologized for the modesty of the donation, but said that it 
represented an expression of his heartfelt sorrow and that of 
his parents.  Charge promised to convey these sentiments to 
Washington.  Charge added that the sum was a large amount for 
Cambodia and that the King's donation, along with the $20,000 
donation provided by the Cambodian government (Ref b), 
demonstrated the will of Cambodia and the Cambodian people 
not to just accept assistance from others, but also 
participate in the world community and help where Cambodia 
was able to assist. 
 
¶3.  We await guidance from the Department Task force on 
accepting the King's donation before we proceed with 
crediting the cash donation.  Today we will credit the RGC 
donation made September 9 as per Ref A instructions.
