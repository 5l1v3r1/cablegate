Â¶1. WAR ON TERRORISM 
 
B) SUMMARY OF COVERAGE: 
 
AMBASSADOR CRAIG STAPLETON'S PRESENTATION OF CREDENTIALS 
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON TO PRESIDENT CHIRAC IS REPORTED IN 
REGIONAL DAILY OUEST-FRANCE AND IN DAILY LE PARISIEN AS WELL 
AS IN AFP AND AP WIRES. 
 
TODAY'S NEWS STILL FOCUSES ON TERRORISM FROM VARIOUS ANGLES. 
RIGHT-OF-CENTER LE FIGARO HEADLINES "LONDON ON THE TRACK OF 
TERRORISTS". FOR LEFT-OF-CENTER LE MONDE, "GOVERNMENTS MUST 
DEFY HARASSING TERRORISM" WHILE CATHOLIC LA CROIX HEADLINES ON 
TERRORISM IN IRAQ "EVERYDAY IRAQ GOES TROUGH TERROR AND 
CHAOS." (SEE PART C). 
 
DANONE MAKES THE HEADLINES OF ECONOMIC NEWSPAPERS AS WELL AS 
SEVERAL EDITORIALS IN THE PRESS. "DANONE: FOLLOWING FEVER, THE 
POLEMIC" HEADLINES RIGHT-OF-CENTER LE FIGARO ECONOMIE WHILE 
ECONOMIC LES ECHOS'S EDITORIAL COMMENTS: ".WHAT SHOULD WE 
THINK OF ALL THIS POLITICAL FUSS THAT STARTED A RUMOR THAT 
FINALLY SEEMS UNJUSTIFIED? . WHAT HAPPENED? . (ECONOMIC 
MINISTER) THIERRY BRETON WAS RIGHT TO REITERATE YESTERDAY THAT 
IT IS FIRST OF ALL THE CEO'S WORK TO PREVENT TAKEOVERS." 
 
FOLLOWING ITS NEW CHALLENGE OF OFFERING TELEVISION ARCHIVES, 
GOOGLE MAKES THE HEADLINE OF LEFT-OF-CENTER LIBERATION, 
"GOOGLE THE NUMERICAL OGRE." THE PAPER ALSO DEVOTES TWO PAGES 
TO THE SUBJECT AMONG WHICH AN EDITORIAL ENTITLED "BIG BROTHER" 
THAT ASKS: "HOW LONG WILL GOOGLE MANAGE TO EXPLOIT FREE 
RESOURCES FROM THE WEB TO RECYCLE THEM IN NUMERICAL 
ADVERTISEMENTS WITHOUT THE WRITERS AND PRODUCERS ASKING FOR 
THEIR PIECE OF THE PIE? AND HAVE THE CONSUMERS WORRY ABOUT THE 
USE MADE OF COLLECTED PERSONAL DATA?" 
 
SPACE SHUTTLE DISCOVERY'S UPCOMING LAUNCH IS REPORTED IN 
VARIOUS PAPERS THAT ALL POINT OUT THAT THERE IS NO ROOM FOR A 
MISTAKE THIS TIME. 
 
AFTER THE FAILED HYDROCHLORIC ACID ATTACK ON A JEWISH SCHOOL 
BY SOME YOUTHS IN THE 18TH ARRONDISSEMENT IN PARIS, INTERIOR 
MINISTER SARKOZY IS REPORTED AS VISITING THE SCHOOL AND SAYING 
"WHEN A JEWISH PERSON IS THREATENED, IT IS THE REPUBLIC THAT 
IS THREATENED." HE CALLED FOR A ZERO-TOLERANCE POLICY ON ANTI- 
SEMITIC ACTS. 
 
 
(C) SUPPORTING TEXT/BLOCK QUOTES: 
 
WAR AGAINST TERRORISM 
 
"PATHOLOGY OF TERROR" 
BRUNO FRAPPAT IN CATHOLIC LA CROIX (07/26) "RADICALIZATION OR 
COMMITMENT UP TO DEATH BECOME WAYS OF EXISTING THAT CAN ONLY 
FEED THEMSELVES FROM HATRED FOR OTHERS HATE OF ALL THOSE THAT 
HAVE - OR SEEM TO HAVE - A COMFORTABLE IDENTITY. THUS 
TERRORISM FINDS - IF NOT ITS LEGITIMACY - AT LEAST ITS AGENTS, 
THROUGH A QUEST FOR ONESELF THAT SEES ACCOMPLISHMENT OF 
ONESELF THROUGH SOMEONE ELSE'S DEATH. TO DRY UP THE SOURCE 
MEANS TO DRY UP A DOUBLE HATRED: HATRED OF ONESELF, HATRED OF 
THE OTHER. POLICE WILL NOT BE ENOUGH. WE NEED A COALITION OF 
ALL THE ENERGIES OF WHAT MAKES US HUMANS, WHAT MAKES US 
SIMILAR. SO THAT NO ONE IS TEMPTED TO TURN ON ONE'S BROTHER." 
 
"DOUBLE OR NOTHING FOR AL-QAEDA" 
GILLES KEPEL IN LE FIGARO (07/26) "THE NUMERICAL REVOLUTION 
AND THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION HAVE 
TOTALLY TRANSFORMED THE TRANSMISSION OF KNOWLEDGE IN ISLAM. 
THE WEB HAS BEEN TAKEN HOSTAGE.BY THE MOST EXTREME GROUPS, . 
ACCELERATING THE CIRCULATION OF JIHADIST IDEAS IN AN 
EXPONENTIAL WAY . THIS INDOCTRINATION CONCERNS A LOT OF YOUTH 
(YOUNGER AND YOUNGER) FOR WHOM THE WEB HAS BECOME THE 
INSTRUMENT OF RELIGIOUS SOCIALIZATION . AND COMES AS A 
SUBSTITUTION FOR INTEGRATION IN REAL SOCIETY. NOW IT IS THIS 
SOCIAL INTEGRATION THAT REPRESENTS THE ONLY ANTIDOTE AGAINST 
TERRORISM BY
