NOMINATING-OFFICER: Information Officer- John Berry 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Mr. Sabet is one of PA-Cairo's senior contacts who have 
been cooperating largely in placing all of our cultural, 
youth and educational programs.  His evening newspaper is 
part of the leading pro-government daily "Al Ahram" and is 
widely read among the Egyptian public.  Despite Mr. Sabet's 
conservative education (Al Azhar high school and university 
are religious), he is always willing to hear about our 
programs and functions in Egypt and see ways of 
cooperation.  Mr. Sabet has long experience in Egypt's 
educational system, and thus his several travels abroad to 
discuss cooperation programs.   Mr. Sabet is also a writer 
of children's stories for the local Egyptian television 
channels due to his educational experience.  However, he 
has never been to the U.S. and North America.  An IV 
program will be an ideal first-hand experience for Mr. 
Sabet to know about the U.S. system and culture that will 
positively impact his future writings.
