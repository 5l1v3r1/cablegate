¶1. (SBU) An estimated 800-1000 Iraqi civilians converged on 
the closed border crossing point at Umm Qasr the morning of 
July 25 protesting lack of compensation for farm land lost 
due to the UN border demarcation.  Kuwaiti contractors 
working on emplacing a pipeline barrier along the border were 
threatened by stonethrowers and withdrew under the protection 
of Kuwaiti border police.  Senior MFA and MOD officials 
separately contacted the Embassy to apprise of the situation, 
but made no specific request for assistance.  Eventually, 
British MND-SE forces assisted in generating an Iraqi police 
response and the protestors moved to a district governorate 
office in Umm Qasr to register their demands for compensation. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Upon receipt of the information we coordinated with 
U.S. and British military to facilitate an appropriate 
response and to diffuse the situation.  Reportedly there was 
some minor physical damage at the border post but no 
injuries.  This episode involved larger numbers of Iraqis 
than previous clashes at spots along the sensitive border, 
highlighting the ongoing need for regular coordination 
between Iraqi and Kuwaiti border police to prevent more 
serious incidents.
