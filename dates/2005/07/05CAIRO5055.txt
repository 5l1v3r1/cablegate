¶1.  (SBU) The Charge chaired on June 29 a meeting of the 
Embassy's Homeland Security Working Group (HSWG).  RSO, 
LEGAT, ORA, DEA, CONS, and ECPO attended. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) ECPO and HSWG members discussed security 
developments in the Sinai in reference to regional terrorist 
threats and in light of reports of several skirmishes between 
armed bedouins and Egyptian police in mid-June.  The 
skirmishes reportedly led to the deaths of 2-3 police and an 
approximately equal number of armed bedouins.  GOE officials 
were quoted in media reports linking the incidents to the 
pursuit of fugitives wanted in connection with the October 
bombings in Taba and Nuweiba, particularly Mohammed Ahmed 
Salah Feleifal, whose brother Soliman reportedly died while 
carrying out the October 7 attack.  HSWG members agreed that 
they would seek from contacts an updated GOE assessment of 
the security situation in the Sinai, and take any appropriate 
steps under the auspices of the EAC committee. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  The Consul General thanked Legat for a recent 
contribution that will be submitted for consideration as a 
Visas Vipers entry.  The Consul General reminded the full 
HSWG to remain alert for information that might be used in 
preparing new Viper entries.
