GEOGRAPHICAL INDICATIONS 
 
REF: SECSTATE 131291 
 
 ¶1. Summary: A broad survey of Taipei retail groceries shows 
that most products marked with the geographic indicators (GI) 
listed in reftel are actually from the region implied by the 
name.  The biggest "offenders" in Taiwan are imported 
cheeses.  Taiwan's Intellectual Property Office has responded 
to calls from the EU to enforce existing legislation to 
protect GI.  Taiwan also has its own geographic indicators 
that could lead some policymakers to support the EU's 
proposal to further restrict use of generic geographic 
indicators.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. AIT/T Econ staff conducted an unscientific survey of six 
retail grocery outlets in the Taipei area, ranging from the 
up-scale (Jason's and City-Super) to the average (Wellcome 
and SongQing), and including discount retailer Carrefour and 
warehouse store COSTCO.  One wine, a Bourgogne found in 
Wellcome that was allegedly produced in the United States, 
did not comply with expected GI.  Our survey found that many 
popular cheeses found in all stores except COSTCO used GIs 
that were contrary to the true origin of the product.  These 
products included Feta from the U.S., Denmark and Australia, 
Parmigiano Reggiano from the U.S. and New Zealand, Mozzarella 
from the U.S., Australia, and Denmark, and Pecorino Romano 
from the U.S.  Our survey also found Prosciutto de Parma from 
the U.S. and Australia, and Kalamata olives from Australia. 
 
¶3.  Taiwan has its own geographic indicators that Taiwan 
producers actively use to promote their own products. Alishan 
tea is famous in Taiwan and Mainland China and commands a 
premium from tea drinkers.  "Taiwan" is used to identify 
everything from beer to vermicelli noodles.   TIPO has in the 
past been approached by EU representatives in Taiwan to 
support increased protections for GI, most recently in the 
2002 European Chamber of Commerce and Trade White Paper. 
That document encouraged the Taiwan authorities to take 
increased actions to enforce rules related to GI and age of 
alcohols.  This recommendation has not been repeated in 
subsequent ECCT White papers.
