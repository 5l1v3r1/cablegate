  ¶1.   NEW WAVE OF ATTACKS IN LONDON 
¶2.   SECRETARY RICE IN AFRICA AND ISRAEL 
¶3.   REVALUATION OF CHINESE CURRENCY 
 
(B) SUMMARY OF COVERAGE: 
 
HEADLINES ARE DOMINATED BY THE ATTEMPTED TERRORIST ATTACKS IN 
LONDON YESTERDAY. "ANXIETY AFTER THE ATTACKS" LEADS RIGHT-OF- 
CENTER LE FIGARO UNDERSCORING IN ITS REPORT THAT THE LATEST 
ATTACKS "CONFIRM AL QAEDA'S AMBITIONS IN EUROPE. AND INTENTION 
TO MAKE GOOD ON ITS THREATS." LEFT-OF-CENTER LIBERATION'S: 
"LONDON: THE STRATEGY OF FEAR," RE-EXAMINES THE LINK BETWEEN 
THE UK'S INVOLVEMENT IN IRAQ AND THE ATTACKS. POPULAR RIGHT-OF- 
CENTER DAILY LE PARISIEN LEADS: "FOUR NEW ATTACKS: FEAR IN 
LONDON," COMMUNIST L'HUMANITE AND CATHOLIC LA CROIX BOTH LEAD: 
"LONDON: ONCE AGAIN A TARGET OF TERRORISM." 
 
POPULAR RIGHT-OF-CENTER FRANCE SOIR NOTES THAT PARIS IS UNDER 
PARTICULARLY CLOSE-WATCH THIS WEEKEND WITH THE TOUR DE FRANCE 
THAT WILL SEE THOUSANDS OF ONLOOKERS GATHERED AT THE CHAMPS 
ELYSEES TO WITNESS THE VICTORY OF LANCE ARMSTRONG. 
 
LEFT-OF-CENTER LE MONDE'S OPINION PAGES FEATURE AN OP-ED BY 
FRENCH DEFENSE MINISTER MICHELE ALLIOT-MARIE ON THE FRENCH 
PRESENCE IN AFGHANISTAN. ALLIOT-MARIE EMPHASIZES THAT FRANCE 
IS COMMITTED TO AFGHAN RECONSTRUCTION. TO THE FIGHT AGAINST 
DRUG TRAFFICKING. AND TO THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM." 
 
LE FIGARO CARRIES A FULL-PAGE INTERVIEW OF ISRAELI PRIME 
MINISTER ARIEL SHARON IN WHICH HE CONFIRMS THE WITHDRAWAL FROM 
GAZA ON AUGUST 15 AND ADDS THAT "THIS WITHDRAWAL WILL OPEN THE 
WAY FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ROAD MAP." SHARON ALSO 
PRAISES FRANCE AS A MODEL IN "FIGHTING ANTI-SEMITISM" AND AS A 
"PRIVILEGED TRADE PARTNER." 
 
SEVERAL DAILIES REPORT THE KIDNAPPING OF TWO ALGERIAN 
DIPLOMATS IN IRAQ. LEFT-OF-CENTER LIBERATION POINTS OUT THAT 
LATELY "DIPLOMATS HAVE BECOME THE PREFERRED TARGETS OF THE 
IRAQI REBELLION." LE FIGARO CARRIES A PARTICULARLY SCATHING 
PIECE ENTITLED: "THE CIVILIAN VICTIMS OF AN ENDLESS WAR" 
FEATURING CHARTS AND GRAPHS THAT GIVE A BREAKDOWN OF CIVILIAN 
VICTIMS IN IRAQ BASED ON AGE, GENDER AND REGION. IN THE REPORT 
DELPHINE MINOUI WRITES: "THE OCCUPATION FORCES ARE PRIMARILY 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATHS OF CIVILIANS. THE RECENT HARDENING 
OF THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT HAVE LED TO A MULTITUDE OF 
`BLUNDERS.'" 
 
SECRETARY RICE'S VISIT TO DAKAR FOR THE 4TH AGOA FORUM IS 
 
SIPDIS 
REPORTED AT LENGTH IN CATHOLIC LA CROIX AND HER SURPRISE VISIT 
TO ISRAEL IS MENTIONED IN L'HUMANITE. (SEE PART C) 
 
THE MAIN ECONOMIC STORY TODAY IS THE REVALUATION OF THE 
CHINESE CURRENCY WHICH IS REPORTED THROUGHOUT THE ELECTRONIC 
AND PRINT MEDIA. CENTRIST BUSINESS-ORIENTED LA TRIBUNE SEES 
THE REVALUATION OF THE YUAN AS "SYMBOLIC" BUT HAVING A VERY 
POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE EUROPEAN MARKETS. ECONOMIC RIGHT-OF- 
CENTER LES ECHOS CALLS THE REVALUATION "A SMALL GESTURE" AND 
LEFT-OF-CENTER LIBERATION SAYS THAT IT IS INTENDED TO "CALM 
WASHINGTON." (SEE PART C) 
 
(C) SUPPORTING TEXT/BLOCK QUOTES: 
 
NEW WAVE OF ATTACKS IN LONDON 
 
"SOWERS OF FEAR" 
THE EDITORIAL IN CATHOLIC LA CROIX BY DOMINIQUE GERBAUD 
(07/22): "WITH THESE ATTACKS. THE TERRORISTS SEEM TO BE 
SENDING OUT A THREE-FOLD MESSAGE TO SAY THAT THEY STILL EXIST, 
THEY REMAIN ORGANIZED AND CAN STRIKE WHEN THEY WANT. IN SHORT 
THEY WILL CONTINUE TO SOW FEAR. THE MESSAGE IS ALSO THAT 
TERRORISM DOES NOT NESTLE EXCLUSIVELY IN THE MOUNTAINS OF 
AFGHANISTAN, IT IS AT OUR DOORSTEP AND ENJOYS THE FREEDOM TO 
MOVE AROUND AS IT PLEASES. THESE TERRORISTS ARE SPREADING 
DOUBT AND FEAR IN OUR SOCIETY. AND IN RESPONSE THERE IS ONLY 
ONE SOLUTION. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MUST BE UNITED WITH 
LONDON AND REFUSE TO GIVE IN TO THE SPIRAL OF FEAR," 
 
"CONFIRMATION OF AL QAEDA'S EUROPEAN AMBITION" 
ARNAUD DE LA GRANGE IN RIGHT-OF-CENTER LE FIGARO (07/22): 
"EVEN IF YESTERDAY'S ATTACKS WERE MINOR COMPARED TO THOSE OF 
JULY 7, THEY PROVE THE NERVE OF THE ATTACKERS GIVEN THE 
CURRENT POLITICAL CONTEXT. THEY ALSO SUBSTANTIATE THE FACT 
THAT AL QAEDA SEEMS TO HAVE AN INFINITE SUPPLY OF HUMAN 
RESOURCES ON BRITISH SOIL. TERRORISM IN EUROPE SEEMS TO BE 
EVOLVING FASTER THAN ANTI-TERRORISM." 
 
"REPEAT" 
GERARD DUPUY COMMENTED IN LEFT-OF-CENTER LIBERATION (07/22): 
"WAS THIS REPEAT ATTACK `INTENDED TO KILL' AS THE CHIEF OF 
SCOTLAND YARD INDICATED? OR WAS IT DESIGNED ONLY TO DERIDE THE 
PUBLIC AUTHORITIES' CAPACITY TO PROTECT ITS CITIZENS? AT THE 
LEAST, THE INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR YESTERDAY'S ATTACKS HAD 
IN MIND TO TWIST THE KNIFE IN THE WOUND AND THEY SUCCEEDED. 
THE THEORY THAT THESE ATTACKS WERE IMPROVISED BY SYMPATHIZERS 
OF THE JULY 7 SUICIDE BOMBERS IS NOT REASSURING AND DOES NOT 
FIT WITH THE IMAGE OF AN ORGANIZATION LIKE AL QAEDA THAT IS 
STRUCTURED AND POWERFUL." 
 
"TO BE IN IRAQ OR NOT TO BE IN IRAQ: THAT IS THE QUESTION" 
MARC SEMO IN LEFT-OF-CENTER LIBERATION (07/22): "THIS REPLICA 
OF THE TREMOR THAT SHOOK LONDON A WEEK AGO POSES A POLITICAL 
CHALLENGE TO THE LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY. TODAY, JUST AS 
WAS THE CASE A WEEK AGO, BRITISH PUBLIC OPINION AND POLITICAL 
LEADERS ARE UNITED. BUT IT WILL NOT TAKE LONG FOR THE DEBATE 
ON THE UK'S MILITARY PRESENCE IN IRAQ ALONGSIDE THE U.S. TO 
RESURFACE. AND THE ANTI-TERRORIST MEASURES THAT HAVE BEEN 
IMPLEMENTED IN LONDON OF LATE, NAMELY THE EXPULSION OF RADICAL 
IMAMS, WILL DO LITTLE TO CALM PUBLIC OPINION ON THE ISSUE OF 
IRAQ." 
 
"THE INFERNAL SPIRAL" 
BERNARD DURAUD IN COMMUNIST L'HUMANITE (07/22): "EVERYDAY WE 
HAVE PROOF THAT IN GREAT BRITAIN, IN EUROPE AND ELSEWHERE IN 
THE WORLD TERRORISM CAN STRIKE BLINDLY AT ANY TIME AND 
ANYWHERE. IS IT POSSIBLE TO BE PROTECTED FROM A STRATEGY OF 
VIOLENCE THAT KNOWS NO LIMITS AND RESPECTS NO RULES?" 
 
SECRETARY RICE IN AFRICA AND ISRAEL 
 
SIPDIS 
 
"CONDOLEEZZA RICE'S CHARM OFFENSIVE IN AFRICA" 
CHRISTINE HOLZBAUER IN CATHOLIC LA CROIX (07/22): "EVERY 
MINUTE OF THE VISIT WAS PLANNED IN DETAIL. AND IS PART OF THE 
WHITE HOUSE'S NEW TACTIC TO WIN OVER THE AFRICAN CONTINENT. 
UNTIL RECENTLY THE THREE TRADE HUBS WERE SITUATED IN 
ANGLOPHONE AFRICA AND IT IS SIGNIFICANT THAT THE FOURTH HUB 
WILL BE IN A FRANCOPHONE COUNTRY: SENEGAL." 
 
"FOR THE SECOND TIME IN ONE MONTH CONDOLEEZZA RICE GOES TO THE 
MIDDLE EAST" 
CORINE LESNES IN LEFT-OF-CENTER LE MONDE (07/22): "DURING MR. 
BUSH'S FIRST TERM IN OFFICE HIS SECRETARY OF STATE - COLIN 
POWELL - WAS CRITICIZED FOR NOT TRAVELING ABROAD ENOUGH. BUT 
LESS THAN SIX MONTHS AFTER TAKING UP THE OFFICE OF SECRETARY 
OF STATE CONDOLEEZZA RICE HAS SHOWN THAT SHE DESERVES THE 
MONIKER OF `GLOBETROTTER.' THE CURRENT SECRETARY OF STATE IS 
SPARING NO EFFORT AND THIS IS ALREADY HER SECOND VISIT TO THE 
MIDDLE EAST IN A MONTH. ON JUNE 20 SHE HAS CREATED A STIR IN 
CAIRO WHEN SHE ACKNOWLEDGED THE MISTAKES THAT THE U.S. HAS 
MADE IN DEALING WITH THE SITUATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST. DURING 
THESE VISITS, THE SECRETARY ALWAYS APPEARS TO BE VERY 
COMFORTABLE AND IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT SHE WAS IN PART 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FOREIGN POLICY DECISIONS OF THE FIRST 
ADMINISTRATION." 
REVALUATION OF CHINESE CURRENCY 
 
"A MONETARY REFORM TO CALM WASHINGTON" 
PIERRE HASKI CORRESPONDENT FOR LEFT-OF-CENTER LIBERATION IN 
BEIJING WRITES (07/22): "THE PURPOSE OF CHINA'S MONETARY 
REFORM IS MORE POLITICAL THAN ECONOMIC IN ORDER TO DEFUSE 
TENSIONS WITH WASHINGTON AND PAVE THE WAY FOR THE CHINESE 
PRESIDENT'S UPCOMING TRIP TO THE U.S. CONSIDERING THE INITIAL 
REACTIONS FROM WASHINGTON, THIS MANEUVER HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL. 
ONLY 48 HOURS AGO PRESIDENT BUSH WAS STILL CALLING ON CHINA TO 
`CHANGE THE WAY IT EVALUATES ITS CURRENCY.' THE EU HESITATED 
TO FOLLOW THE EXAMPLE OF THE U.S. VIS-A-VIS CHINA AND FINALLY 
FELL IN BEHIND. BUT WASHINGTON'S SATISFACTION WITH THE CHINESE 
GOVERNMENT'S DECISION MAY BE SHORT LIVED." 
 
"CODED MESSAGE" 
PASCAL AUBERT EDITORIALIZED IN CENTRIST BUSINESS-ORIENTED LA 
TRIBUNE (07/22): "THE MESSAGE IS CODED, AS ALWAYS WHEN IT 
COMES FROM CHINA. BY OPTING TO REVALUE ITS CURRENCY WHEN IT 
WAS THE LEAST EXPECTED, THE CHINESE AUTHORITIES HAVE SENT A 
CLEAR MESSAGE TO THE REST OF THE WORLD THAT IT IS USELESS TO 
TRY AND INFLUENCE OR INTIMIDATE CHINA. BEIJING WILL MAKE 
DECISIONS IN SPITE OF INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE. BUT THE CAT AND 
MOUSE GAME IS FAR FROM OVER." STAPLETON
