¶1. Post's Visa Viper Committee met on Friday, July 1, 2005. The 
Ambassador chaired the meeting, which was attended by Consular, 
Pol/Econ, ODC, DAO, ORA, Public Affairs, Management, FSI Arabic 
language field school, and MEPI representatives.  We reviewed 
the recently disseminated revised procedures for 2005, and 
Ambassador encouraged all committee members to re-read the 
incoming cable. 
 
¶2. Names of individuals who had come to the attention of RSO 
were submitted, in addition to one pulled from open source 
reporting by the PAO. (Mr. Laajili was sentenced by a Tunisian 
court for attempting a suicide mission in Iraq). Committee 
members were unanimous that this individual merits inclusion in 
the lookout system.
