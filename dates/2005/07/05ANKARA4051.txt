¶1.  (SBU) We delivered reftel points to Turkish MFA Middle 
East Department Head Bozay July 12.  Bozay undertook to pass 
the requests to the Turkish Ministries of Interior 
(responsible for Turkey's police forces) and Defense.  He 
expressed optimism Turkey will find a way to contribute to 
the urgent needs in reftel. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) In the longer term, Bozay told us Turkey is 
interested in providing experts to train Palestinian security 
forces in subjects such as forensic investigation, 
peacekeeping operations, and police personnel management. 
The Turks will coordinate with the Israelis on this and avoid 
providing training or equipment that could be construed as 
designed to build up a "military" force as opposed to a 
civilian security force.
