¶1. (SBU) Action request: The Slovak Ministry of Defense would 
like to add to the agenda of Ambassador Jones' July 22 
pol-mil talks on Iraq discussion on Slovak intentions to end 
participation in OEF and join ISAF in Afghanistan.  Please 
advise if the team from Washington will be prepared to 
discuss this issue with the Slovaks.  End action request. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Vladimir Jakabcin, Director General for Defense 
Policy and International Relations at the Slovak Ministry of 
Defense sent the following letter to the Charge, received on 
8 July, 2005. 
 
Dear Sir (Scott): 
 
The Slovak Republic, through its involvement in Operation 
Enduring Freedom and NATO-led International Security 
Assistance Force in Afghanistan (hereinafter "ISAF"), 
strongly supports the effort of international communities to 
establish a secure and stabile situation in Afghanistan. 
 
The idea for greater synergy between the Operation Enduring 
Freedom under the leadership of the United States, which has 
been there since the aftermath of September 11th to fight the 
Taliban and the al-Qaeda terrorist elements, and the expanded 
ISAF role in the hands of NATO is endorsed by the Slovak 
government. 
 
Contemporary (current) activities of the Slovak unit deployed 
within Operation Enduring Freedom have to be re-evaluated, 
and we are in the process of finding an appropriate place for 
subsumption into ISAF structures.  Our intention is to finish 
our participation in OEF by the end of this year and to join 
the ISAF operation by the beginning of the next year.  To 
receive your attitude (opinion) to this approach would be 
highly appreciated. 
 
With the intention to discuss all possible questions which 
could arise from this intended transformation, I propose to 
include this topic into the agenda of talks between the 
Slovak MoD and the US civ/mil Team on Iraq which will take 
place in Bratislava on 22nd of July. 
 
With respect, 
 
Vladimir Jakabcin /s/
