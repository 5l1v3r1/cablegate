Â¶1. (SBU) Post delivered reftel points to the Regional 
Security and Peacekeeping Division (IDC) at Foreign Affairs 
Canada on June 30, just prior to the Canada Day long 
week-end.  In a follow-up discussion on July 7, desk officer 
Emi Furuya informed polmiloff that a Canadian Coast 
Guard/RCMP team in the field is conducting an assessment of 
maritime and coastal policing needs of the Palestinian 
Authority based on recommendations from the Canadian missions 
in Ramallah and Tel Aviv.  Furuya said that the Canadian 
government is unable to provide funding for the items on the 
USSC's list, adding that USG was "aware" of the assessment 
team's presence, as well as Canadian intent to provide 
technical assistance, through a Canadian Border Services 
liaison officer "embedded" on USSC Ward's staff.
