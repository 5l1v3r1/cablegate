SUBJECT: FRENCH REQUEST TO INTERVIEW COALITION DETAINEE 
 
¶1.  (SBU) We have received a letter from the French 
Embassy, Baghdad requesting that Judge Philippe 
Courroye, First Investigating Judge at the Upper Paris 
Court be permitted to interview Mr. Tariq Aziz, Mr. 
Taha Yasin Ramadan, and Mr. Amir Rashid al-Tikriti 
al-Ubaydi, all currently held in Coalition detention 
facilities, on matters related to oil-for-food funds. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Mr. Tariq Aziz and Mr. Taha Yasin Ramadan 
have appeared before investigative judges of the Iraqi 
Special Tribunal, and are in Iraqi legal custody 
pending trial. The ITG ordinarily controls access to 
these detainees, and we understand that the French 
Embassy has requested access through appropriate 
Iraqi channels. We also understand that MNF-I will 
support the ITG's decision on this matter.

¶3.  (SBU) Mr. Amir Rashid al-Tikriti al-Ubaydi, 
however, remains in the legal as well as the physical 
custody of MNF-I. We therefore seek guidance as to 
how to respond to the French Embassy's request, and 
thank the Department in advance for its assistance.
