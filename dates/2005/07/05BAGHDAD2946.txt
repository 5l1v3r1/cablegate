SUBJECT: PROPOSALS FOR POSSIBLE UNHCR ASHRAF ENGAGEMENT 
 
-------------- 
ACTION REQUEST 
-------------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Embassy asks the department to request that 
US Mission Geneva approach UNHCR to determine whether 
UNHCR will be willing to undertake any of the actions 
listed in paragraph (2). 
 
-------------- 
TALKING POINTS 
-------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) MNF-I requests UNHCR assistance in one of 
the following forms for 192 Iranian nationals living 
in an MNF-I tent city (the Temporary Interview and 
Protection Facility, or TIPF) on the outskirts of the 
former Mujahideen-e-Khalq (MeK) military base at Camp 
Ashraf who are awaiting refugee status determinations 
(proposals are listed in descending preference): 
 
(i) that UNHCR representatives set a date to visit 
Camp Ashraf to conduct refugee status determination 
interviews with 192 Iranian nationals who have 
dissociated themselves from the MeK. MNF-I is able to 
provide secure convoy and helicopter transport to Camp 
Ashraf from Baghdad International Airport or the 
Iranian border, as well as accommodations and 
communications capability; 
 
(ii) that UNHCR representatives set a date on which 
UNHCR representatives would be willing and able to 
begin small-group refugee status determination 
interviews at the Muntheria-Khosravi Iraqi-Iranian 
border crossing. MNF-I is able to arrange use of 
indoor facilities at the border, and to transport 
interviewees round-trip from Camp Ashraf; 
 
(iii) that one or more UNAMI representatives visit 
Camp Ashraf (MNF-I is able to provide round-trip 
helicopter transport for a days' visit) to speak with 
refugee status candidates about UNHCR's willingness to 
conduct refugee status interviews in future; 
 
(iv) that one or more UNAMI representatives agree to 
meet with a small representative delegation of refugee 
status candidates from Camp Ashraf in Baghdad to speak 
to the same (MNF-I is able to provide round-trip 
convoy transportation for the Ashraf residents). 
 
------------------------- 
ADDITIONAL TALKING POINTS 
------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) MNF-I is aware that refugee status 
interviews will not provide a quick fix for these 192 
Iranian nationals, and rapid third-country 
resettlement is unlikely. The 192 interviewees, many 
of whom have awaited refugee status interviews for 
two years or more, are likewise aware that refugee 
status determination will not enable their immediate 
departure from Camp Ashraf. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) However, there is a growing tension in the 
TIPF as residents voice their resentment that ICRC- 
assisted repatriation is successful and ongoing for 
those willing and able to return to Iran, but that no 
corresponding arrangement has been made for those 
fearing for their safety upon repatriation. Several 
recent unexpected runaways into the desert and 
isolated occurrences of self-harm attest to the 
rising stress levels. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) MNF-I believes that an expression on UNHCR's 
part of willingness to engage on humanitarian grounds 
would greatly reduce tension in the TIPF, and have a 
positive effect on morale. MNF-I would also welcome 
any additional proposals UNHCR may make with the aim 
of achieving a similar effect. 
 
--------------------------- 
QUERY FOR US MISSION GENEVA 
--------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Many residents of the TIPF have written 
lengthy accounts of their PoW experiences, kidnapping 
by the MeK, or persecution inside Iran which they have 
requested MNF-I pass to UNHCR. If UNHCR does not plan 
to visit Camp Ashraf or otherwise make contact with 
MNF-I soon, MNF-I would appreciate guidance on how to 
handle this correspondence. (TIPF residents have 
access to APO mail, but are unsure of the correct 
address for personal letters to UNHCR.)
