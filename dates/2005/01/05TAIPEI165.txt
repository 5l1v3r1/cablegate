SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: CROSS-STRAIT CHARTER FLIGHTS 
 
"[Taiwan] Government Should Hold a National Policy 
Debate on the Cross-Strait Charter Flights Plan and 
Make a Final Decision on the Issue by Conducting a 
Public Vote" 
 
The pro-independence "Liberty Times" editorialized 
(1/14): 
 
". The charter flight plan is a policy tool being used 
by China to `pressure the officials through businessmen 
and to push for unification using economic means.' 
China eagerly wants to use the plan to highlight the 
fact that `cross-Strait air links are basically 
domestic routes' (since the matter is arranged by the 
private sectors rather than via talks between the two 
governments) and thereby declare to the world that 
`cross-Strait issues are domestic affairs.'  Beijing 
wants to use this fact to convince other countries to 
accept its rationalization for use of force against 
Taiwan and consequently achieve its ultimate goal of 
annexing the island.  Thus, questions regarding 
`charter flight' and `direct transportation' across the 
Taiwan Strait are by no means [related to] an issue 
that is so simple that `one can do it anytime one 
wants,' unless those who want to do it are those who 
want to be become citizens of the PRC.  We therefore 
want to sincerely remind our government that there are 
many things that the government can do for its people, 
so it should not waste any more of its precious time on 
cross-Strait direct transportation or charter flights. 
. 
 
"[We] hope the government would act honestly and 
frankly and hold a national debate on the cross-Strait 
charter flight and direct translation issues, and then 
make a final decision by holding a pubic vote on the 
issues.  Only by doing so can the government show its 
responsibility to all of the people of Taiwan."
