SUBJECT: MESSAGE FOR GENERAL CASEY 
 
King Abdullah continues to value his dialogue with U.S. 
military leaders.  As we maintain and bolster Jordanian 
support for U.S. goals in Iraq, and deepen the King,s 
understanding of our own appreciation of the military and 
security situation there, these contacts are invaluable. 
Should you find the time to stop in Amman, perhaps during a 
theater transit, your visit would be very useful and much 
appreciated by the King.  We could make the most of it by 
focusing on a meeting with him and dispensing with 
time-wasting protocol events.  A visit just after the 
January 30 election would be ideal, but Embassy Amman and the 
Jordanians would welcome you whenever you can spare the time. 
BAGHDAD MINIMIZE CONSIDERED. 
 
HALE
