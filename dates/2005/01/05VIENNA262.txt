¶1.  (SBU) At a January 28 meeting, Foreign Ministry Middle 
East director (assistant secretary-equivalent) Ralph Scheide 
told EconPolCouns that Foreign Minister Ursula Plassnik would 
issue a positive statement Monday, January 31 on the Iraq 
elections.  Scheide's draft (which the Foreign Minister had 
not yet approved) congratulates the Iraqi people for their 
historic achievement in holding elections, notes the need to 
overcome anti-democratic violence, and discusses further 
assistance to Iraq.  Scheide said the EU planned to make its 
own announcement along similar lines on Monday. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The draft Austrian statement notes that Austria has 
organized a special program to train ten Iraqi diplomats at 
Austria's Diplomatic Academy.  Scheide said the program 
begins at the end of January and runs for two months. 
Austria will cover all the costs of the course, which amount 
to some 100,000 euros, and will not seek co-funding or 
reimbursement (as it would normally do for foreign students). 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Scheide also told us that an Austrian will observe 
absentee voting in Amman.  The observer is an Interior 
Ministry official at Austria's Embassy in Amman. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Austrian firms have begun to engage in Iraq, 
Scheide said.  Austrian-Iraqi trade had expanded by 170 
percent in the past year, albeit from a low baseline. 
However, Austrian firms were not anxious for publicity at 
this point, fearing that a higher profile would make them 
targets of violence in Iraq.
