Poloff delivered reftel talking points to MFA DAS-equivalent 
for Human Rights in the Directorate of United Nations and 
International Organizations Affairs Beatrice le Fraper du 
Hellen on January 18.  In a follow-up conversation, Fraper du 
Hellen said French concurred that a resolution on the status 
of Afghan women (reftel A) was unnecessary this year. 
Regarding the UNCHR resolutions (reftel B), Fraper du Hellen 
noted the French felt that there were too many resolutions 
proposed without sufficient follow-through.  She recommended 
that specific priorities be identified, with fewer 
resolutions but greater effort exerted to assure success. 
Fraper du Hellen was concerned that without the US as a main 
co-sponsor, a Belarus resolution might have difficulty 
passing.
