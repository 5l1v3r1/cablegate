¶1. Poloff conveyed reftel points on the International Mission 
for Iraq Elections (IMIE) to Deputy Director General for the 
Near East Alberto Moreno on January 3.  Moreno thanked poloff 
for the information and said he would respond at a later date 
with GOS views.  On January 11, we learned from a separate 
MFA contact that Spain had provided $20 million to the UNDP 
in support of the January 30 Iraq elections, a gesture the 
MFA source implied was aimed at improving bilateral relations 
with the USG as much as at helping the Iraqi carry out their 
elections (Further elaboration will be provided septel). 
 
¶2. Poloff contacted Moreno on January 12 to discuss the 
Spanish contribution to the UNDP and possible GOS support for 
the IMIE.  Moreno said that the $20 million GOS transfer to 
UNDP to support the Iraq elections came from Spain's $300 
million commitment made during the Iraq Donors Conference. 
He said there were no further funds or other support 
available for IMIE, but that he believed the Spanish 
contribution would complement IMIE efforts.  Moreno noted 
that the GOS had significant concerns about the difficulty of 
carrying out the elections, but saw no alternative to moving 
forward with a vote as quickly as possible.  In Spain's view, 
the officials elected in the upcoming elections will enjoy 
greater credibility locally and internationally than the 
current authorities, a fact that should contribute to 
improved security for the Iraqi people.
