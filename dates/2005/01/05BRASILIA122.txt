SUBJECT: IAEA COMPREHENSIVE SAFEGUARDS AGREEMENTS AND 
ADDITIONAL PROTOCOL 
 
REF: STATE 268619 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Ministry of External Relations (MRE) Disarmament 
and Sensitive Technologies (DDS) Division Chief Santiago 
Mourao confirmed that reftel letter regarding IAEA 
comprehensive safeguards and the Additional Protocol was 
provided to Foreign Minister Amorin in December.  Mourao 
acknowledged that the G-8 letter contained "positive 
elements" including an offer of assistance in negotiating 
with the IAEA.  While the GOB recognized the complexity of 
any discussions with the IAEA, the DDS chief, however, was 
doubtful such help would be requested. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Mourao reconfirmed Brazil's stated position on the 
AP: it was not against the Additional Protocol but is 
proceeding deliberately in assessing the impact of the AP on 
Brazilian enterprises and likely will only resume discussions 
on it with the IAEA following the NPT revcon. He added the 
GOB is not prepared to offer any AP-related "gesture" before 
the May conference.  However, Mourao did point to a new 
bureaucratic development that will jump-start the GOB's 
inter-ministerial AP review process.  Led by the National 
Commission on Energy, an inter-agency review panel is being 
set up which, Mourao said, would review the AP and prepare 
Brazil's position vis a vis the IAEA.  Mourao or his deputy 
will likely chair the panel.
