¶1.  ESTHOFF and ECONOFF passed Ref A points January 14 to: 
(A) Juan Pablo de Laiglesia y Gonzalez de Peredo, the number 
two-ranking official in the Spanish Aid Agency (AEC); (B) 
Maria de la Concepcion Soto Calvo, the Director General of 
the Education and Science Ministry's Oceanographic Institute; 
and (C) Juan Segovia de la Torre, an official attached to the 
Environment Ministry's National Meteorology Institute.  De 
Laiglesia and Segovia de la Torre plan to attend the Kobe 
Conference.  De la Concepcion may attend. 
 
¶2.  COMMENT:  Spain has consistently "punched above its 
weight" in response to the Asian tsunami disaster (see Ref 
B).  Thus, we are not surprised that they are taking quite 
seriously Kobe's World Conference on Disaster Reduction.
