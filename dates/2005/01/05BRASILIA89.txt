SUBJECT: INVITATION FROM BRAZILIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY FOR NIH 
TO VISIT BRASILIA FOR DISCUSSIONS ON ISSUES RELATED TO 
MEDICAL RESEARCH PROJECTS 
 
REF:  EMAIL 12/17/2005 TO KEVIN BIALY 
 
---------- 
Summary: 
---------- 
¶1.  The Brazilian Foreign Ministry has extended an 
invitation to Kevin Bialy (and other NIH representatives if 
desired) to visit Brasilia after January 15, 2005, for face- 
to-face discussions related to NIH medical research 
projects.  The topics mentioned by the Brazilians were 
discussion of a speedier system for processing the grants 
and a way for the Brazilian government to know that the 
recommendations that accompany their letters of grant 
acceptance were being considered. Embassy encourages 
acceptance of the invitation, and would hope a visit could 
be scheduled in January 2005.  End summary. 
 
---------- 
Background 
---------- 
 
¶2.  In November 2004, Brazil's Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
communicated with Embassy Brasilia regarding the possibility 
of holding discussions with NIH on above-mentioned issues. 
Embassy Brasilia supported this initiative because, as you 
know, recent letters of grant acceptance from the Ministry 
to NIH contained "recommendations" that NIH adhere to 
provisions of Brazilian law pertaining to rules on research 
involving human subjects. In an effort to ensure that NIH 
was aware of all Brazilian rules and regulations in this 
area, Embassy requested and received a copy of Brazilian 
Ministry of Health publication "Rules on Research Involving 
Human Subjects" (English) and forwarded it via FEDEX to 
Kevin Bialy. 
 
---------- 
Meeting To Clarify Issues 
---------- 
 
¶3.  In subsequent discussions with Minister Counselor 
Vergniaud Elyseu Filho, Chief of the Division of Science and 
Technology at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Embassy 
related its desire to have a clearer understanding of the 
"recommendations" included in the grant acceptance letters. 
Elyseu Filho explained that recommendations in the 
acceptance letters are generated either by the Ministry of 
Health or the National Commission for Ethics in Research. 
He expressed a willingness to invite representatives from 
each of these entities to the meeting to clarify this 
process and other issues. 
 
¶4.  Embassy strongly supports the Brazilian request for NIH 
to travel to Brasilia, and hopes that it can be scheduled in 
January.  We recommend that because of national holidays, 
you avoid the period February 2-15, as often Ministry 
officials are unavailable. 
 
¶5.  We view this meeting as an excellent opportunity to 
ensure that NIH has access to all rules and regulations 
governing your activities in Brazil.  It will also provide 
the Brazilians with an opportunity to express to you any 
concerns they may have. 
 
¶6.  Embassy believes the research funded and conducted in 
Brazil by NIH with its Brazilian partners is an extremely 
positive and important component of our bilateral 
relationship.  Judging from the attitude of those we've 
spoken to at the Ministry, the Brazilians hold this 
partnership in equally high regard. 
 
¶7.  NIH may reply to this communication either by cable, or 
email to Brasilia Embassy Science Counselor Patricia Norman 
at NormanPD@state.gov Tel: 55 61 312-7401.  Logistical 
details can be worked out after your acceptance has been 
received.
