(SBU) On February 25, Panamanian Foreign Minister Samuel 
Lewis Navarro informed DCM that he had given instructions to 
Panamanian OAS Ambassador Royo to argue that the chair of the 
working group that will draft the OAS social charter and 
action plan should be chosen by consensus.  FM Lewis said 
that the GOP does not want the issue to go to a vote because 
it believes that may create ideological divisions within the 
OAS.  Lewis said he would make that point to his colleagues 
at the presidential inauguration in Montevideo on March 1.
