(SBU) According to Ministry of External Relations (MRE) 
Disarmament and Sensitive Technologies (DDS) Division Chief 
Santiago Mourao, the IAEA has granted its okay for 
commissioning of the Resende uranium enrichment facility. 
The commissioning will take place after operational testing 
to begin in mid-February.  Mourao believed that when 
operational, Resende would not be enriching fuel up to the 
levels allowed by the IAEA.  Mourao noted that there were 
still small technical details that needed to be worked out 
between the GOB and the IAEA, for example, the issue of cost 
sharing.
