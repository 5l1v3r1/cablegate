REF: JERUSALEM 698 
 
(SBU) Palestinian Ambassador Auni Mohommed Battash telephoned 
the Ambassador February 22 to reinforce the Palestinian 
Authority's positive reaction (reftel) to the President's 
February 21 speech in Brussels on the Palestinian-Israeli 
conflict.  Battash offered his "whole-hearted support for the 
President's cooperative approach to peace in the Middle 
East."  Saying he watched the speech on television, the 
Palestinian felt the remarks in Brussels were exactly the 
"right way to proceed and to address the conflict."  He 
repeatedly applauded the President's wisdom and insight.
