(C) SUPPORTING TEXT/BLOCK QUOTES: 
 
BUSH-PUTIN MEETING IN BRATISLAVA 
 
"BUSH DEMANDS DEMOCRACY FROM PUTIN" 
LAURE MANDEVILLE IN RIGHT-OF-CENTER LE FIGARO (02/24): "THE 
RUSSIAN-AMERICAN RELATIONSHIP IS LIGHT YEARS FROM WHAT IT WAS 
IN 2001 WHEN THE TWO HEADS OF STATE MET IN SLOVENIA. THE 
ALLIANCE THAT WAS CREATED TO FIGHT TERRORISM AFTER SEPTEMBER 
11 IS HAVING MORE AND MORE TROUBLE RESISTING RUSSIA'S 
REVERSALS IN DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM. THE RECENT ATTEMPT BY THE 
KREMLIN TO TRY AND THWART THE ELECTIONS IN UKRAINE HAS PUT A 
SERIOUS STRAIN ON THE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO PRESIDENTS. 
GEORGE W. BUSH IS ATTACHED TO A PRAGMATIC DIALOGUE WITH MOSCOW 
BUT WANTS TO GIVE IT A LESSON IN DEMOCRACY AT THE SAME TIME, 
TWO OBJECTIVES THAT APPEAR TO BE IRRECONCILABLE." 
 
"CRISIS ON THE HORIZON" 
SACHA BALIT VANDEBROUCK IN POPULAR RIGHT-OF-CENTER FRANCE SOIR 
(02/24): "GEORGE BUSH IS THE ETERNAL `LESSON GIVER' AND SINCE 
YESTERDAY THIS ROLE HAS BEEN REINFORCED BY THE EUROPEAN 
COMMISSION WHEN IT SANCTIONED THE PRESIDENT'S INTENTION TO 
REMIND VALDIMIR PUTIN OF THE BASICS OF DEMOCRACY." 
 
"BUSH AND PUTIN: TROUBLE BREWING" 
PAUL FALZON IN COMMUNIST L'HUMANITE (02/24): "THE AMERICAN 
PRESIDENT EMBARKED ON A SENSITIVE MISSION TO WIN OVER EUROPE. 
EVEN IF HIS VISIT DID NOT PRODUCE MUCH IN THE WAY OF RESULTS. 
IT DID SUCCEED IN PART IN IMPROVING THE TRANSATLANTIC 
RELATIONSHIP. TODAY THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT WILL MEET HIS 
RUSSIAN COUNTERPART IN BRATISLAVA FOR A SUMMIT THAT WILL NO 
DOUBT BE TENSE. INDEED, OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS WASHINGTON 
HAS NOT MINCED WORDS WITH REGARD TO MEASURES TAKEN BY MOSCOW 
IN THE MEDIA OR ENERGY SECTORS. MOSCOW, FOR ITS PART HAS TAKEN 
PAINS NOT TO RESPOND TOO HARSHLY. AND TODAY VERY FEW SUBJECTS 
BIND THESE TWO FORMER COLD WAR ADVERSARIES." 
CHINA ARMS EMBARGO 
 
"CHINA, RIVAL OR PARTNER?" 
JACQUES AMLARIC IN LEFT-OF-CENTER LIBERATION (02/24): "THE 
DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN EUROPE AND THE U.S. OVER THE LIFTING OF 
THE ARMS EMBARGO TO CHINA WAS NOT RESOLVED DURING GEORGE W. 
BUSH'S VISIT TO BRUSSELS AND IS NOT ABOUT TO BE. THE U.S. SEES 
CHINA AS A RIVAL MILITARY POWER WHICH IS COMPLETELY THE 
OPPOSITE VIEW OF THE TWO EUROPEAN LEADERS MOST IN FAVOR OF THE 
LIFTING OF THE EMBARGO: JACQUES CHIRAC AND GERHARD SCHRODER. 
FOR THEM, CHINA IS THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT TRADE PARTNER IN 
EUROPE AND A STRATEGIC PARTNER THAT SHOULD NO LONGER BE 
HUMILIATED." 
 
"CHIRAC-BUSH: A RE-MARRIAGE OF CONVENIENCE" 
PIERRE BEYLAU IN WEEKLY NEWS MAGAZINE LE POINT (02/24): "CHINA 
MAY BECOME THE NEXT BIG APPLE OF DISCORD BETWEEN EUROPE AND 
THE U.S. AMERICA CONTINUES TO VIEW CHINA AS A STRATEGIC AND 
ECONOMIC RIVAL WHILE EUROPE HAS NO INTENTION OF LETTING ITSELF 
BE EMBARKED ON AN ANTI-CHINESE CRUSADE."  LEACH
