FRAMEWORK OUTREACH ON SECTORAL INITIATIVES 
 
REF: STATE 17096 
 
1.EconOff met on 2/4/05 with Arancha Herran Lafoz, an 
international relations staff person for the Spanish 
Confederation of Business Organizations (CEOE), to discuss 
sectoral initiatives per reftel request.  Herran explained 
that CEOE is a national umbrella organization representing 
many different interests.  Moreover, CEOE coordinates its 
international trade positions with the European Union of 
Businesses (UNICE) in Brussels.  She said that CEOE's basic 
position was that before sectoral initiatives could be 
considered, Doha round trading partners should agree upon 
non-lineal tariff cuts from applied, not bound, rates for a 
maximum 15% rate.  Herran would not be drawn into a 
discussion into what sectoral initiatives CEOE might support, 
although she noted that in Cancun, CEOE supported a sectoral 
textiles/footwear initiative, as long as it was based upon 
reciprocity.  In March, CEOE will survey its members 
regarding what sectors might be appropriate for sectoral 
intiatives.  Herran promised to share the results of this 
survey as soon as it was completed.
