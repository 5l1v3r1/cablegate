¶1.  (SBU) Summary: Palestinian militants launched three 
shooting attacks at IDF and Israeli settler targets February 
11-14, including one in which militants fired on Israeli 
laborers who were putting up a fence along the Kissufim Road. 
 No injuries were reported.  The GOI agreed February 14 to 
the release of some 500 Palestinian prisoners, all of whom 
must have served at least two-thirds of their sentences and 
have no "blood on their hands" from direct attacks against 
Israelis.  The bodies of 15 Palestinian militants were to be 
handed over in Gaza February 14 as a good will gesture to Abu 
Mazen.  In the West Bank, the IDF shot and killed a 
Palestinian man February 14 who reportedly attacked an IDF 
solider with a knife in Nablus.  Abu Mazen named BG Mahmoud 
Asfour as acting commander of Gaza and West Bank police on 
February 12, according to Palestinian security sources, 
replacing Sa,eb al-Ajaz, whose resignation, along with those 
of eight other security commanders, was accepted last week 
after the Hamas shelling of Gaza settlements.  End Summary.
