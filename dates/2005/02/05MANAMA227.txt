¶1. This is an action cable.  Please see paragraph 4. 
 
¶2. Newly appointed Minister of Information and Minister of 
State for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Mohammed Abdul Ghaffar, 
requested USG assistance to professionalize Bahrain 
Satellite Television during a February 10 meeting with the 
Ambassador.  Dr. Abdul Ghaffar asked us to identify an 
American media organization or consultants who would serve 
as in-house advisors on management, programming, technology, 
and set design at the Bahrain Satellite Television Channel, 
the Kingdom's only  government-owned and operated satellite 
television outlet.  The Minister emphasized the importance 
of improving television news services in the Arab world. 
 
¶3.  The Ambassador briefed the Minister on MEPI-funded media 
training programs which are currently active in Bahrain. 
The Minister requested additional support from MEPI in 
improving Bahrain Satellite Television. 
 
¶4.  ACTION REQUEST:  Post requests information on media 
organizations and/or implementers that could advise the 
Ministry of Information on management, programming, 
technology, and set design at the Bahrain Satellite 
Television Channel.  The Minister  would like the 
implementer to provide a comprehensive plan on the steps 
needed to improve Bahrain Television, and the timeframe 
expected to complete the project.  They are looking for an 
experienced implementer that could walk them through all of 
the necessary steps, beginning with a baseline assessment. 
The implementer would be expected to develop a detailed plan 
on how to improve the quality of broadcasting, including 
staffing, training and equipment recommendations. 
 
¶5.  Per reftelcon, an early March visit by NEA/PI Romanowski 
would provide an excellent opportunity to explore how best 
to move forward.
