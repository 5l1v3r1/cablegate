TURKEY PLANS DEMOCRACY ASSISTANCE DIALOGUE MEETING ON 
WOMENS' ISSUES IN JUNE

June DAD Meeting in Istanbul Focused on Women 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  According to MFA Policy Planning Department Head Tezel, 
the MFA is working with the Turkish Economic and Social 
Studies Foundation (TESEV), a local NGO, to organize a June 
conference in Istanbul focusing on the role of women in 
society.  This will probably be the first event in the 
Democracy Assistance Dialogue (DAD), co-sponsored by Turkey, 
Italy and Yemen.  Tezel said the MFA picked this topic 
because it is one "in which Turkey has a comparative 
advantage." 
 
¶3.  The MFA and TESEV will ask other Turkish NGOs and 
academics to participate.  They will also invite foreign 
governments and NGOs.  Tezel currently expects modest 
participation of about 30-40. 
 
¶4.  Tezel does not foresee funding will be an obstacle to the 
conference.  The GOT, as host, will finance the costs of the 
conference and is considering funding some regional 
participants' expenses.  Tezel said the UK has expressed 
interest in helping with funding and the GOT is looking into 
whether the G-8 has funds available. 
 
¶5.  The MFA appointed Ambassador Omur Orhun to a 
newly-created post of BMENAI Coordinator in January.  Orhun 
has been OSCE Ambassador.
