SUBJECT: CBD AND GENETIC RESOURCE SHARING IN VENEZUELA 
 
REF: STATE 269625 
 
¶1. (U) This telegram is in response to reftel's request for 
information regarding access and procedures for access to 
genetic resources in Venezuela. 
 
--------------------------- 
Laws and National Authority 
--------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Access to genetic resources is controlled by the 
Ministry of the Environment and National Resources (MARN) 
through its National Biodiversity Office.  The principal 
legal framework under which procedures and policies are 
governed is the National Biodiversity Law (Ley de Diversidad 
Biologica) of 2000. In addition, as a member of the Andean 
Community, Venezuela is governed by Andean Community decision 
391, which sets out rules and responsibilities for the 
competent national authority, MARN.  There are numerous other 
laws that relate in some way to the activities of the 
National Biodiversity office. A full list of these can be 
found on the Web at ( 
http://www.marn.gov.ve/marn/default.asp?caso= 11&idart=829 ). 
 
---------------- 
Research Permits 
---------------- 
 
¶3. (U) Research permits are administered by MARN. In order to 
obtain a permit, an entity must work in conjunction with a 
Venezuelan counterpart. The permit application must also be 
submitted simultaneously to MARN and to the Ministry of 
Science's National Council for Science, Technology, and 
Innovation (CONACIT).  All scientific and research permits 
are issued by the Venezuelan Government at the national 
level.  It is important to note that research conducted by 
foreign government agencies also requires permission of the 
Office of Economic Development of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs. 
 
¶4. (U) Research permit applications must include information 
about: the applicant, the supplier of the genetic and/or 
biological resources, the Venezuelan point-of-contact (person 
or institution), the project leader and his/her working 
group, the nature of the project, and the location where the 
access to materials will be carried out.  A full project 
proposal must also be included.  Regulations stipulate that 
applications should be evaluated within 30 days, but 
provisions exist which allow for longer time frames.  Visas 
are processed after permits have been issued. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Movement and Collection of Specimens 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶5. (U) The collection of samples of plant and or animal 
specimens in situ requires additional permissions.  Animal 
trapping requires a Hunting for Scientific Purposes License, 
and plant collection requires a Permit for the Collection of 
Botanical Samples.  Both permits are issued through the 
Administrative Permit Office of MARN. 
 
¶6. (U) The export of non-CITES specimens requires 2 sets of 
permissions. An export permit must be obtained from the 
Administrative Permit Office of MARN, and a sanitary/health 
permit must be obtained from the Farming and Livestock Safety 
Service (SASA) of the Ministry of Agriculture.  SASA also 
issues import permits.
