ORGANIZATIONS ON SECTORAL INITIATIVES IN THE WTO

¶1.  Ref A requested information on private sector 
organizations which might have an interest in a 
sectoral initiative within the non-agricultural market 
access (NAMA) negotiating framework in the WTO.  While 
there are a number of Turkish industries (especially 
the apparel, leather, tile, glassware) with an interest 
in seeing tariff reductions in the U.S. and other 
export markets, they may not be strong supporters of a 
WTO initiative in their sectors because of the EU 
customs union.  Turkish industries enjoy an enormous 
competitive advantage in the EU market as a result of 
the customs union's zero tariff on virtually all 
industrial goods.  A sectoral deal could thus benefit 
them in non-EU markets but neutralize Turkey's 
advantage in Europe.  The Turkish apparel industry, for 
example, has been a strong advocate, together with its 
U.S. counterpart and others, for protectionism in its 
sector following the end of the quota system last 
month. 
 
¶2. That said, it may be worth approaching several 
Turkish business chambers to gauge their interest in 
sectoral liberalization. Three prime candidates would 
be: 
 
-- the Turkish Industrialists and Businessmen's 
Association (Tusiad), Mesrutiyet Cad. 74, 80050 
Tepebasi, Istanbul, Turkey; Contact:  Haluk Tukel, 
Secretary General, +90 212 249 11 31.
