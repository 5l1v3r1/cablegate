REF: TEL AVIV 0960 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Summary: In a February 24 meeting with Embassy and 
USAID officers, Norwegian police advisor Arnstein Overkil 
identified reconstruction of the PA's police forensic lab and 
training in crime scene investigation techniques as two 
possible areas where Norway might undertake programs to 
assist the PA security forces.  Overkil was uncertain whether 
community policing was a high PA priority, but was hopeful 
that newly-appointed PA Minister of Interior Nasser Yusuf 
would take difficult steps to pension off over-age officers. 
Stressing that the Norwegian government does not intend to 
make any decisions imminently, Overkil was focused in his 
assessment on ensuring that any Norwegian programs are 
thoroughly and effectively coordinated with those of other 
donors, in particular the EU COPPS program (reftel), and 
Egyptian and U.S. efforts.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Norwegian police expert Arnstein Overkil briefed 
Embassy and USAID officers February 24 on the results of his 
ongoing assessment for the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs of what role the GON might play in reforming the PA 
security services.  Overkil introduced himself as a chief of 
police in Norway, where he is also a public prosecutor and, 
until 2004, head of the Norwegian Security Service.  He 
portrayed his current eight-day mission as one of 
coordination as well as assessment, stressing Norway's desire 
to mesh potential programs with those of other donors, in 
particular with the EU COPPS program (reftel), but also with 
U.S. and Egyptian efforts.  Overkil also said that it would 
be his strong recommendation to the Norwegian government to 
undertake no program unless it had been specifically 
requested by the PA.

¶3.  (SBU) While cautioning that no decisions would be taken 
by the GON for at least several weeks, Overkil said he had 
identified shortcomings in both technical and managerial 
areas, noting that "delegation of authority is a nonexistent 
concept" in the PA police.  Furthermore, a lack of trust 
exists between the police and the population, he said.  He 
agreed with DCM's observation that the tendency, particularly 
in Gaza, to settle what would in other circumstances be legal 
matters through an informal justice system among the leading 
clans is a major challenge to the rule of law.  Competition 
among the various branches of the security services, while 
not in itself necessarily a bad thing, had blossomed under 
Arafat's tutelage into an unhealthy, cutthroat system that 
"would remain in the room for a while," he said, even though 
Arafat has now departed the scene.  Asked about prospects for 
pensioning off some 4,500 police officers to make headway in 
"right-sizing" the force, Overkil said it would be difficult, 
adding that he hoped newly-appointed PA Minister of Interior 
Nasser Yusuf would appoint people willing to take on 
difficult but necessary steps such as this.  Pol/C noted that 
Yusuf had expressed confidence in the availability of 
competent officers to move into more senior positions, once 
those positions open up.

Where Norway Might Fit

¶4.  (SBU) Overkil said that, although his assessment could 
not be definitively completed due to the lack of a sitting PA 
government (Note: The new PA government was confirmed only on 
the final day of Overkil's mission), he would be recommending 
that the GON focus on the civil police and possibly the 
Preventive Security Organization (PSO).  Specifically, 
Overkil listed four areas where he thought immediate 
attention could focus: 
    -- Reconstruction of the forensic laboratory in Gaza that 
had been built with EU and other European funds in the 
mid-90's and destroyed at the outbreak of the current 
Intifada. 
    -- A train-the-trainers program to develop crime scene 
investigation capability in the police: "As long as the 
police cannot carry out proper criminal investigations, they 
will continue to lose the respect of the population." 
    -- Leadership and managerial training for senior and 
upper mid-level officers as an "urgent requirement." 
    -- Training for female police officers in "more than 
secretarial skills."

Any Space for Community Policing?

¶5.  (SBU) Asked about the biggest change since he last worked 
in the region (as an advisor on police issues to 
then-Chairman Arafat as well as to the EU), Overkil said that 
the atmosphere in 1994-95 was much more optimistic than 
currently, although things are looking up now that there is 
new PA leadership.  He recommended that donors assist the PA 
but, at the same time, hold the PA strictly accountable for 
the use of any funds or equipment provided.  When asked if he 
has seen any evidence of Palestinian interest in community 
policing programs, Overkil responded that he hoped the PA 
would request programs in this category, as some mid-level 
officers with whom he spoke recognized the public's lack of 
confidence in the police.  USAID officers concurred with 
Overkil's assessment that forensic skills are lacking, adding 
that prosecutors, while happy with an 80 percent case 
resolution rate, had no data on the number of cases that 
could not be brought to trial for lack of evidence.
