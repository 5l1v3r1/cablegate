¶1. Summary:  A DOE-State team visited Ankara and Istanbul 
January 14-17 to meet with officials of the Turkish Atomic 
Energy Commission (TAEK) and operators of the TR-2 research 
reactor at the Cekmece Nuclear Research Center.  Discussions 
focused on possible Turkish participation in a combined 
shipment of high enriched spent fuel from the Eastern 
Mediterranean in September 2005.  TAEK noted its general 
agreement with the shipment but raised questions about how it 
would affect the ability of the TR-2 to continue operating 
without a new supply of fresh LEU fuel.  The US team agreed 
to take the Turkish questions back to Washington for 
interagency review and technical analysis with the intention 
of making a detailed proposal before the end of February.  If 
an agreement in principle can be reached by that time Turkish 
participation in a Septermber shipment can probably be 
arranged.  A summary report of the discussions and activities 
during the visit is at para. 8  End summary. 
 
¶2.  A DOE-State team visited Ankara and Istanbul January 
14-17 to meet with officials of the Turkish Atomic Energy 
Commission (TAEK) and operators of the TR-2 research reactor 
at the Cekmece Nuclear Research Center.  The purpose of the 
visit was to discuss possible Turkish participation in a 
combined shipment of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) to the United 
States planned for September 2005 and to evaluate the 
condition of the fuel and the capability of the facility to 
support such a shipment.  The proposed shipment would 
included SNF from research reactors in Austria, Israel and 
Greece as well as irradiated fuel containing HEU from TR-2. 
 
¶3.  Charles Messick of DOE Savannah River Site, Allan Krass 
of State/NP/NE and Emboff Kevin Lyon met with TAEK in Ankara 
on Friday, January 14, while Michael Dunsmuir and Randall 
Dunavant of Westinghouse Savannah River visited the small 
Triga research reactor at Istanbul Technical University 
(ITU).  The latter visit resulted in an understanding that 
the ITU reactor, which uses only LEU fuel, would not be 
interested in participating in a spent fuel shipment at this 
time.  The full team, with the addition of Nicholas Jenkings 
of NAC International, DOE,s shipping contractor, visited the 
TR-2 facility at Cekmece on Monday, January 17. 
 
¶4.  In Ankara, Messick presented an overview of the Foreign 
Research Reactor (FRR) Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) Acceptance 
Program and the proposal that Turkey participate in the 
proposed September shipment.  It was made clear to TAEK that 
under the rules of the program Turkey, as an "other than high 
income economy" would not have to pay either the shipping 
costs or the DOE management fee for the spent fuel.   Messick 
also emphasized the program requirements that the operators 
agree to convert the reactor from HEU to LEU fuel and to 
cease irradiation of all the HEU to be shipped at least 90 
days before the scheduled fuel loading. 
 
¶5.  The primary TAEK interlocutors were President Mr. Okay 
CAKIROGLU, Director Dr. Sevket Can and Reactor Department 
Head Dr. Sinan Taylan.  They made clear TAEK,s continued and 
expanding interest in both nuclear power and nuclear research 
and noted that they not only wanted to resume operation of 
the TR-2 after seismic upgrading, but that they planned to 
increase its operating power from 5 to 10 Megawatts and to 
build a new research reactor at a site near Ankara.  The TAEK 
officials noted their agreement in principle to participating 
in the shipment but also noted specific requests for 
consideration that would eliminate any risks to the 
successful operation of the TR-2.  In particular they noted 
that the reactor could continue to operate for some time on 
their inventory of partially burned HEU assemblies, and they 
suggested that a satisfactory way would have to be found to 
replace the unused HEU with LEU before they could agree to 
participate.  Mr. CAKIROGLU also requested that TAEK be 
permitted to keep a single unirradiated HEU assembly 
containing about 280 grams of HEU.  The U.S. side agreed to 
take these requests back to Washington for interagency 
discussion and also asked TAEK to provide a technically 
detailed proposal for what it wants to do with the one fresh 
assembly. 
 
¶6.  At Cekmece on Monday the full team was given a tour of 
the TR-2 reactor.  After the tour Messick, Krass and Lyon 
continued discussion on contract and policy issues, while the 
Savannah River and NAC reps examined the condition of the 
fuel and the transferring and loading capabilities of the 
facility.  A list of discussion items, agreements and 
proposed actions is provided in the summary record in para.8. 
 The most important of these from the policy point of view 
are the question of consideration for unused HEU. 
DOE and State will discuss these requests and prepare a 
detailed proposal for TAEK.  Experts from the Reduced 
Enrichment for Research and Test Reactors Program will be 
consulted for technical advice and will communicate with Dr. 
Taylan to clarify the operational requirements that must be 
satisfied.  It was understood by both sides that, in order to 
achieve a shipment in September, these issues must be 
resolved by the end of February in order to reach an 
agreement in principle on Turkish participation.  It was also 
agreed that TAEK, in consultation with the US Embassy, would 
look into the possibility of shipping the SNF from a port 
closer to the Mediterranean than Istanbul.  This would have 
the advantage of shortening the ship voyage and could have 
other efficiency and security 
advantages as well. 
 
¶7.  Inspection of the fuel found no significant corrosion or 
damage that might delay or prevent a shipment.  The SNF pool 
water was judged to be of good quality, however there was 
visual indication that a small amount of algae was present. 
There did not appear to be any insurmountable problems in 
transferring the fuel from the reactor pool to shipping casks 
and getting those casks to an appropriate 
port for loading on the ship.  TAEK understands that it is 
likely that the ship will already have SNF from other 
countries on board and that this may require some special 
licensing and security activities.  But they expressed no 
concern that this could not be handled satisfactorily in the 
time available. 
 
¶8.    The following is the trip report completed by the 
Department of Energy representative.  This report was shared 
with TAEK and contains more exact details of the findings and 
actions needed to be taken prior to the return of the fuel 
rods.

PURPOSE OF THE VISIT 
 
To discuss U. S. nuclear weapons nonproliferation policy and 
program issues concerning the Foreign Research Reactor (FRR) 
Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) Acceptance Program,  to discuss 
potential implementation of a near-term shipment of SNF from 
the TR-2 Research Reactor and contractual changes to support 
these activities, to evaluate the HEU SNF for transportation 
and future storage at the Savannah River Site, to evaluate 
the equipment and capabilities of the facility to package and 
prepare the material for shipment, and to determine shipment 
needs and requirements.  WSRC also conducted a brief review 
of the TRIGA fuel located at the Nuclear Energy Institute at 
Istanbul Technical University (ITU). 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
The Turkish Atomic Energy Commission was founded in 1956 as a 
first step in the recognition of peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy in Turkey.  The first task of this Commission was the 
establishment of the ekmece Nuclear Research and Training 
Center (CNAEM) in 1962 in Istanbul.  The first Turkish 
Research Reactor, TR-1 (1 MW), was also installed and 
operated in the same year at CNAEM.  TR-1 was operated 
continuously for fifteen years from May 27, 1962 to September 
13, 1977.   The 32 fuel assemblies from TR-1 were sent to SRS 
in 1984.  The TR-1 reactor was functionally replaced by the 5 
MW TR-2 reactor in 1982 to meet the increasing demand for 
radioisotopes.  The TR-1 reactor components still exist at 
CNAEM. 
 
At the time of this visit, the most recent operation of the 
TR-2 reactor occurred on January 7, 2005 for 
approximately 4 hours.  The reactor is operated briefly 
approximately once per week.  TAEK has plans to increase 
power from 5 MW to 10 MW in the future.  Currently, 18 HEU 
fuel assemblies and three LEU fuel assemblies are in the core. 
 
The ITU-TRR is a TRIGA Mark II type reactor.  Construction 
was started in 1975 and initial criticality occurred in 1979. 
 The reactor operates at 250kW using the original core 
consisting of 69 stainless-steel-clad LEU rods. In 1999, the 
reactor had accumulated approximately 231 MWhr of operation. 
Ten fresh TRIGA rods remain at ITU, two of which are 
instrumented.  Additional information can be found in the 
previous DOE trip report meeting minutes dated October 13, 
¶1999. 
 
FUEL INVENTORY 
 
The TR-2 fuel assemblies are MTR type assemblies. 
 
Characteristics of TR-2 fuel and control assemblies that may 
be returned to the U.S. are provided below. 
 
HEU 
Nominal Number at Facility 
30  Consisting of: 
18 standard (23 plates), 
1 fresh control instrumented assembly 
2 irradiation (12 plates) 
1 standard instrumented assembly 
8 control (17 plates)) 
 
Enrichment   93.3 % 
Fuel Meat   U-Al alloy 
Clad         Al 
Initial U-235(g) /assembly 
281 standard (2 irradiation@146; 1 std instrumented@281; and 
1 control instrumented @ 208 ) 
Burn-up     40% average 
 
LEU 
 
Nominal Number at Facility 
16  Consisting of: 
10 standard (23 plates) 
 2 irradiation (12 plates) 
 4 control (17 plates) 
Enrichment  19.8% 
Fuel Meat   U3SI Dispersion in Al 
Clad  Al 
Initial U-235 (g) / assembly 
406 standard (300 control, 212 irradiation) 
Burnup      (see below) 
 
Only two standard LEU assemblies and one irradiation assembly 
are in the core at present.  The standard 
elements have a burnup of about 7.5% and the irradiation 
assembly 12.5%. 
 
Note 1: One of the irradiation assemblies is a fresh LEU 
assembly.  The irradiation assemblies have 12 plates (TR2 
1004) with tubes in the center for irradiation activities. 
The assembly construction is slightly different from the 
standard assembly. 
 
Note 2: TAEK also has approximately 110 pins about 15' high, 
1/2' diameter, containing  1% U-235, that were provided by 
Brookhaven National Laboratory for a pile experiment in the 
1960s.  TAEK did not request that these be considered for 
acceptance. 
 
Note 3:  The instrumented assemblies are both HEU, one with 
little burnup and the other unirradiated. 
 
CONDITION OF FUEL 
 
All spent fuel is stored in the large part of the TR-2 pool. 
Most of the fuel is stored in two baskets located on the 
floor of the pool.  The assemblies in the core are located in 
the TR-2 side of the pool.  The reactor pool is stainless 
steel lined.  All spent fuel is stored in aluminum racks. 
Fresh fuel is stored in a vault located one floor below the 
reactor. 
 
An evaluation of fuel was conducted by WSRC.  A detailed 
report from WSRC will be issued under separate report.  The 
reactor pool water is high quality and the fuel appears to be 
in good condition; however there was visual indication that a 
small amount of algae was present.  Reactor personnel 
reported that one standard assembly and one control assembly 
are suspected of leaking during the previous visit in 1999. 
 
FACILITIES RELATED TO PACKAGING 
 
Mr. Nick Jenkins of NAC International conducted a detailed 
evaluation of the facilities related to packaging for 
consideration of conducting a future shipment.  The overhead 
bridge crane capacity is 10 metric tons.  There is about six 
meters (20 feet) between the crane hook and the top of the 
reactor pool.  On the bottom level of the reactor building 
there is a small transfer cask, about 40 centimeters in 
diameter that was used to remove fuel from the reactor in 
1984 and load the fuel into a shipping cask.  The transfer 
cask is in good condition and weighs about 1 ton.  Also 
stored on this level is the water tank that was used to mate 
with the IU-04 cask that was used to ship the TR-1 fuel to 
the U.S. 
 
The reactor building access doors are approximately 3 meters 
wide x 5 meters high and open onto an asphalt paved area. 
The access doors open into a partial ground level floor of 
the reactor building that has a floor load of 20 tons.  The 
outside area leading to the reactor access airlock has 
sufficient working area and is accessed by a   9 meters (30 
feet) wide road leading into a turnaround area just outside 
the reactor access airlock that is   9mX18m (30, x 60,). 
 
A demineralized water supply is available. 
 
POTENTIAL TRANSPORTATION ROUTE FROM THE REACTOR TO THE 
PORT OF EXPORT 
 
During the previous visit, M. Ozal stated that the best 
transportation route would be to take the shore road from the 
facility to the Istanbul Old City and load the truck/cask 
onto one of the truck/vehicle ferries departing from the 
piers at the base of the Galata Bridge.  The ferry would then 
proceed across the Bosphorus to Harem where the truck would 
drive off the ferry and travel a short distance to the 
general cargo piers located there.  Another suggestion was 
made to consider a a route to the same port in Istanbul that 
travels over the "Fatih Bridge" across the Bosphorus along a 
more convenient road.  However, further considerations for a 
port would be to move the casks further south toward the 
Mediterranean Sea for greater shipment efficiency. 
 
REGULATORY AUTHORITY 
 
The TR-2 at the Cekmece Nuclear Research and Training Center 
is part of the Turkish Atomic Energy Authority.  There is no 
separate nuclear regulatory authority in Turkey at the 
present time. 
 
POTENTIAL PROBLEM AREAS 
 
No significant problems have been identified. 
 
DISCUSSIONS, AGREEMENTS, AND ACTIONS 
 
1.)   The following documents were provided to the reactor 
operator: 
     Compilation of Contract Clauses for Countries with 
Other Than High Income  Economies 
     Revision 8 of Appendix A 
     Revision 9 of Appendix B 
     The FRR SNF Acceptance Program Record of Decision with 
Changes No. 1 through 3 and Fee Policy notices for high 
income economy countries and other-than-high income economy 
country reactor operators. 
 
2.)   Previous discussions, agreements, and actions were 
documented in the DOE Trip Report from    October 12, 1999. 
 
3.)   TAEK understands that DOE desires to establish a 
shipment of FRR SNF from the eastern Mediterranean area to 
arrive in the United States in September 2005.  TAEK and DOE 
agreed that a shipment may be possible if an agreement in 
principal can be reached, particularly regarding an agreement 
for consideration for TAEK,s unused U-235 in the existing 
HEU fuel.  TAEK expects to deplete the HEU, if continued to 
be used, to 60% burnup.  DOE agreed to reply to TAEK 
regarding U-235 consideration in TAEK,s HEU fuel. 
Additionally, TAEK desires to receive any potential 
replacement fuel prior to the shipment of their HEU. 
 
4.)   TAEK and DOE discussed that a contract between another 
FRR in Europe and CERCA is being made to fabricate fuel 
essentially identical to the LEU fuel that would be needed by 
TAEK, and that a fresh LEU material shipment to CERCA from 
DOE,s Y-12 facility is expected in about two months. 
 
5.)   TAEK has been informed that if TR-2 were to make a 
shipment of fuel to the United States, TAEK would be treated 
for contractual purposes according to the economic status of 
the country at the time of the shipment in accordance with 
the Federal Register Notice for Fee Policy. 
 
6.)   The DOE and TAEK also understand that TAEK will be 
expected to provide assistance to the shipment effort to the 
extent possible given their technical capabilities at the 
time of the shipment.  Additionally, DOE and TR-2 understand 
that specific responsibilities for tasks will be negotiated 
within the contract. 
 
7.)   TAEK indicated that there was a desire to restart the 
reactor for short periods with fuel       identified for 
return shipment.  DOE and TAEK will negotiate further reactor 
operation with fuel that will be returned to ensure 
sufficient cooling time will exist to meet shipping 
requirements. 
 
8.)   TAEK has been informed that the shipment of SNF from 
TR-2 may be combined with other countries, shipments and as 
such it is possible that when the vessel arrives in Turkey,s 
port of export, it could have SNF from other countries on 
board. 
 
9.)   TAEK understands that the DOE FRR SNF Acceptance 
Program has been extended for 10 additional years and as 
such, after full conversion to LEU fuel, LEU fuel assemblies 
with uranium enriched in the United States would be eligible 
for return to the United States under the FRR SNF Acceptance 
Program if the fuel is removed from the core (no longer 
irradiated) prior to May 13, 2016 and the shipment completed 
prior to May 13, 2019. 
 
10.)  Mr. Okay CAKIROGLU requested to keep the one fresh HEU 
fuel assembly with an agreement that TAEK would not use the 
assembly if an agreement to participate is made.  DOE asked 
that TAEK submit a request with appropriate justification and 
conditions 
 
11.)  TAEK and DOE agreed that Dr. TAYLAN and Dr. Jim Matos 
of Argonne National Laboratory will       communicate 
regarding the potential uses of the unused U-235 remaining in 
TAEK,s HEU fuel. 
 
12.)  TAEK,s existing LEU fuel was manufactured by CERCA. 
Specifications are contained in CERCA     drawing 2588200 
dated April 12, 1991 for the control assemblies and CERCA 
drawing 2588100 dated April 4, 1991 for the standard 
assemblies. 
 
13.)  TAEK and DOE understand that TAEK currently has uranium 
credit at DOE,s Y-12 Facility.     According to Y-12 the 
credit is for 4.703 Kg at 85.6%, which translates to 
approximately 21 Kgs of LEU at 19.75% enrichment.  Exact 
amounts must be verified. 
 
14.)  Mr. Kevin Lyon of the US Embassy in Ankara agreed to 
investigate the potential use of other ports in Turkey that 
may make a shipment from TR-2 more efficient for a combined 
shipment.
