Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (U) On February 14, the Central Bureau of Statistics 
(CBS) published updated 2004 figures showing growth of 4.3% 
for the year, a significant improvement over growth of 1.3% 
in 2003.  This compares well with 3.6% average growth in the 
OECD during the year.  Israeli GDP per capita increased by 
2.5% in 2004, following three years of declines.  Business 
sector GDP increased by 6.2% (versus 1.7 percent in 2003), 
more than making up for the 2% decrease in governmental 
spending.  A 14.6% increase in exports and 5.2% increase in 
private sector consumption contributed significantly to the 
improved economic picture.  The bright picture was dimmed 
only by the figures showing declines in both FDI and 
investment in fixed assets during the year.  Final growth 
figures will be reported in March. 
 
------------------------------ 
Exports as an Engine of Growth 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (U) The 2004 Israeli economy was largely driven by 
exports of goods and services, which increased by 14.6% and 
totaled USD 50 billion. This built on the 6.2% increase in 
exports the previous year, which followed negative export 
growth in 2001 and 2002.  Increases were seen in virtually 
all key sectors.  Industrial exports excluding diamonds, 
which account for more than 52% of total exports of goods 
and services, increased by 16.2 percent in 2004.  The 
resurgence of Israel's high-tech sector helped drive this 
growth, with exports in this sector increasing more than 21% 
during the year.  Agricultural exports increased 18.3% in 
2004, compared with growth of 5.8% in 2003. 
 
¶3. (U) Interestingly, the largest percentage increase in 
exports came in tourism, which is counted as a service 
export.  This grew 30% to USD 5.1 billion in 2004 versus USD 
3.9 billion in 2003.  Naturally, comparisons with 2003 must 
be viewed in light of the very low level of tourism in the 
run-up to the Iraq War.  In fact, the 2004 level was 
significantly lower than that of 1999 to 2000, when tourism 
exports totaled USD 15 million and USD 12.8 million 
respectively. 
 
------------------------ 
Israelis Consuming Again 
------------------------ 
 
¶4. (U) After exports, increasing private consumption 
expenditure was the second most important component of 
growth.  This increased 5.2% in 2004, following two years of 
minimal growth of 1.3% in 2003 and 1.1% in 2002.  The 
reasons for the improvement in the consumption picture was 
an increase in the standard of living of 3.4 percent in 
2004, compared with declines of 0.5 percent in 2003, and 0.9 
percent in 2002.  This resulted in large part from a 2% 
increase in real wages (following two years of declines); a 
decline in unemployment from 10.7% in 2003 to 10% as of 
November 2004; and increased labor participation.  The GOI's 
reduction of purchase taxes on electronics and household 
appliances, as well as the decrease in the VAT from 18% to 
17%, also had a significant affect, leading to a 15.2% 
increase in per capita expenditures on consumer durables. 
This good news on the personal expenditure side was 
reflected by data showing that consumer confidence rose 
significantly in 2004, reaching a level of 89 points in 
January 2005, the same level as before the outbreak of the 
Intifada in September 2000. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Public Expenditures Continues to Decline 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) Public sector expenditures continued to decline in 
2004 by 2 percent in line with the 2003 Economic Recovery 
Plan's objective to reduce the size of the public sector. 
This followed a decline of 2 percent in 2003.  The 
expenditure reductions occurred in non-military spending, 
primarily as a result of the Government's economic reform 
plan. 
 
--------------------------- 
Investment a Disappointment 
--------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Investment was the only weak point in the 2004 
economic numbers.  Investment in fixed assets remained 
sluggish, declining by 2.1 percent in 2004, following 
declines of 7 percent in 2002 and 4.9 percent in 2003.  The 
decline was primarily due to weakness in the building 
sector.  Foreign domestic investment (FDI) fell 
precipitously in 2004 to USD 1.6 billion from 3.9 billion in 
2003, in part as a result of issues relating to accounting 
classifications.  The Bank of Israel in its December 27 rate 
announcement said, "Investment remains the Achilles' heel of 
the growth process in Israel." 
 
------------------------ 
2004 Budget Deficit 3.9% 
------------------------ 
 
¶7.  (U) The budget deficit in 2004 totaled just under NIS 
20.4 billion, equal to 3.9% of GDP, which is slightly below 
the official GOI deficit target of NIS 20.6 billion, or 4% 
of GDP.  This represents a decline of NIS 7.3 billion from 
the deficit of NIS 27.7 billion, or 5.6 percent in 2003. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
BOI Brings Interest Rate to All-Time Low 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶8. (U) The Bank of Israel (BOI) maintained its policy of 
decreasing rates whenever economic conditions permit in 
order to encourage growth.  This was explicitly stated in 
the BOI's December 27th press release. "In the last two 
years the Bank of Israel has changed the focus of its 
interest-rate policy so as to support economic growth. 
Within this framework the Bank reduced the interest rate 
from 9.1 percent in December 2002 to the current rate of 3.7 
percent."  The BOI further reduced rates 0.2% at the end of 
January 2005 to 3.5%, the lowest BOI rate in Israeli 
history.  It maintained this rate in February.   These 
declines have been made possible by 2004's low inflation 
rate of 1.2%.
