REF: STATE 20503 
 
Per reftel instructions we contacted the Taiwan Ministry of 
National Defense and learned that there will be a 
procurement tender for 100,000 units of a component of the 
M77 grenade issued in the near future, but there has been no 
approach by any South Korean company regarding this item. 
The 2002 solicitation YR91A06W023 was awarded to the U.S. 
company D&Z.  MND noted that no South Korean company could 
sell the item unless third country sales had been licensed 
by D&Z.
