REF: HARARE 83 AND PREVIOUS 
 
(U) On February 8, three of the ZANU-PF officials found 
guilty of spying on ZANU-PF for South African intelligence 
were given jail sentences. The three, Zimbabwe,s 
ambassador-designate to Mozambique, Godfrey Dzvairo, banker 
Tendai Matambanadzo, and ZANU-PF external affairs director 
Itai March, pled guilty on December 24 but later changed 
their plea to not guilty on the basis that they were without 
legal representation when they made their plea.  The 
magistrate threw out their change of plea and upheld the 
guilty plea.  Dzvairo received a sentence of six years, and 
the other two received five years each, according to the 
Herald and the Daily Mirror newspapers.  The trial of ZANU-PF 
deputy security chief Kenny Karidza is ongoing.  Chinhoyi 
M.P. Phillip Chiyangwa is awaiting trial on similar charges.
