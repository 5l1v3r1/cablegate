SUBJECT: ISRAELI PRESS REPORTS CLAIM ATTORNEY GENERAL 
REVERSES ABSENTEE PROPERTY RULING 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Summary.  Both Ha'aretz and radio station Kol 
Israel report Tuesday February 1 that Attorney General 
Menachem Mazuz has "instructed the government to immediately 
halt" applying the Absentee Property Law in East Jerusalem. 
Mazuz is reported to have done this through a letter to 
Finance Minister Netanyahu, who supervises the Custodian of 
Absentee Properties Office. Embassy was unable to obtain GOI 
comment on the press reports in spite of repeated attempts to 
speak with a range of Israeli officials in the Foreign, 
Justice, and Finance ministries.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (U)  According to the reports, the AG states in his 
letter that applying the law in East Jerusalem to the 
properties of Palestinians is not in accordance with the 
objective of the law.  The reports also state that: 
 
-- Mazuz wrote in the letter that applying the law to East 
Jerusalem properties "could also have grave diplomatic 
repercussions on the separation fence, which has drawn strong 
criticism from the International Court of Justice at The 
Hague.  This is an issue where clearly Israel's interest 
would be to avoid opening new fronts in the world and in 
international law." 
 
-- Mazuz claimed not to have been informed of the GOI 
decision to apply the law in East Jerusalem.  According to 
Ha'aretz: "Embarrassed Justice Ministry officials could not 
explain how Mazuz wound up in the dark on such a sensitive 
matter, which clearly required a legal seal of approval.  The 
issue constitutes a serious organizational failure that is 
now being investigated..."

¶3.  (SBU)  The Absentee Property Law issue has been 
front-page news since Ha'aretz first reported it Friday, 
January 28.  It appears the AG has decided to take a clear 
decision not to apply the Law in East Jerusalem.  Embassy 
expects to obtain a definitive GOI comment within 24 hours.
