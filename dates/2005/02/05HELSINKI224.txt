Classified By: ACTING POLITICAL CHIEF DAVID ALLEN SCHLAEFER FOR REASONS 
 1.4(B) AND (D) 
 
¶1. On February 7, the Embassy delivered the Ref A non-paper 
on the upcoming NPT RevCon to Laura Kansikas-Debraise, new 
director of the Finnish MFA's Arms Control, Disarmament, and 
Non-Proliferation Unit.  In doing so we noted that a USG-GoF 
dialogue on RevCon issues already has started in New York; 
stressed that the U.S. wants to continue that dialogue in the 
months to come, including conversations here between Embassy 
Helsinki and the MFA; invited GoF comments on the non-paper 
and/or any of the issues it covers; and asked what Finland's 
objectives for the RevCon will be.  Kansikas-Debraise thanks 
the U.S. for taking the initiative, gave the document a quick 
scan, and said she would like some time to digest it before 
responding.  Embassy will seek a response from MFA as soon as 
possible; Washington will also recall that Ref B gave GoF's 
preliminary thoughts on the RevCon. 
 
¶2. The Government of Finland agrees with us on the importance 
of universal implementation of the NPT but also wants the USG 
to abide by our obligations concerning disarmament.  Public 
diplomacy outreach should focus on what the USG has done to 
reduce nuclear arms and counter disinformation about 
remaining stockpiles or new weapons programs; it should also 
stress the grave implications of a failure to disarm by Iran 
and North Korea. 
 
¶3. We would recommend an op-ed (available to posts in the 
last week of April) signed by a senior USG official making 
these points, preferably targeted toward European posts.  Our 
first priority would be placement in Finland's (and 
Scandinavia's) leading daily, 'Helsingin Sanomat,' or another 
major national newspaper. 
 
¶4. A DVC with a senior official on disarmament and U.S. 
compliance would be useful on the eve of the NPT RevCon.  The 
target audience would be journalists and commentators, and we 
would explore doing the DVC at the MFA press and information 
division to maximize exposure and permit GoF officials to 
attend.  We will maximize our targeted distribution of the 
electronic journal on nuclear proliferation in March. 
 
¶5. Should it be possible for a senior USG official to visit 
Finland before the RevCon, we would arrange interviews with 
major print and broadcast media.
