¶1.  Mr. Blessing Manale, Director for Sustainable 
Development Coordination at the Department of 
Environmental Affairs and Tourism (DEAT), confirmed 
to us on February 1 that the South African Government 
(SAG) would attend the Second International Forum on 
Sustainable Development in Marrakech, Morocco on 
March 21-23.  SAG also participated in the First 
International Forum in Rome in 2004.  Manale said 
that SAG regarded Type II partnerships as a critical 
outcome of the Johannesburg Summit on Sustainable 
Development and remained committed to implementing 
them wherever possible. 
 
¶2.  Manale told us that SAG began initial discussions 
on how best it could support Morocco to ensure the 
success of the forum.  DEAT has also requested that 
the Department of Minerals and Energy (DME) and the 
Department Water Affairs and Forestry (DWAF) consider 
participating in the forum.  Manale said that it was 
urgent that his Minister, Mr. Marthinus Van 
Schalkwyk, receive an invitation to any ministerial 
level event being planned for Sunday, March 20 as 
soon as possible. 
 
¶3.  As it stands, Ms. Pam Yako, DEAT Chief Operating 
Officer and slated to become Acting Director General 
by the end of February, will head South Africa's 
delegation to the forum.  Other delegates will be as 
follows: 
 
-- Mr. Alf Wills, Deputy Director General, 
International Cooperation 
-- Ms. Judy Beaumont, Chief Director, Planning and 
Coordination 
-- Mr. Zaheer Fakir, Head of International Liaison 
and Coordination 
-- Mr. Blessing Manale, Director for Sustainable 
Development coordination.
