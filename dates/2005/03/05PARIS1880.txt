SUBJECT: FRENCH RESPONSE ON ICJ NOMINATION 
 
REF: STATE 40125 
 
¶1. We delivered to the MFA's International Organizations 
directorate March 10 a diplomatic note in support of Judge 
Buergenthal's nomination, together with the judge's 
curriculum vitae.  Poloff met March 21 with MFA IO advisor 
Didier Gonzalez, congratulating the GoF on the appointment to 
the ICJ of Ronny Abraham, and noting that the U.S. National 
Group had been pleased to support Abraham's candidacy. 
 
¶2. Poloff urged that France support and co-nominate Judge 
Buergenthal's nomination in accordance with past practice of 
support among permanent members of the Security Council for 
each other's candidates.  Gonzalez replied that while the GoF 
was still looking at other candidates for positions on the 
ICJ nominated by other countries, France would support Judge 
Buergenthal's nomination in accordance with past practice.
