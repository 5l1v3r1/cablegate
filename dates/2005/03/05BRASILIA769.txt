& d) 
 
¶1.  (C)  Ministry of External Relations (MRE) Chief of 
Disarmament and Sensitive Technologies, Santiago Mourao, 
acknowledged that while he still believed the OAS is not an 
appropriate forum for a stand-alone MANPADS resolution, 
others obviously felt that it is appropriate.  As a result of 
active interest from other countries, Brazil would certainly 
participate in working towards a consensus resolution, he 
said. 
 
¶2.  (C)  As anticipated by reftel, Mourao responded to 
talking points by outlining the GOB's difficulties with the 
proposed MANPADS resolution.  The GOB has no problem with 
keeping such weapons out of the hands of terrorists, he 
noted, but it is concerned with protecting the interests of 
Brazil's military.  Mourao appreciated receipt of the USG 
points, and he assured poloff that Brazil would work towards 
an acceptable final document. 
 
¶3.  (C)  Comment:  Generally, Mourao's ability to articulate 
the GOB position on weapons or non-proliferation issues is 
excellent.  This time, however, his explanation regarding the 
MANPADS issue -- that the GOB is just looking out for its 
military and is very concerned with the disposal of older 
MANPADS -- fell flat.  Having lost on the question whether 
ultimately there would or would not be an OAS MANPADS 
resolution, the GOB, we suspect, in order to keep face, will 
insist on relatively minor changes to the resolution.  Mourao 
appears to understand the resolution does not seek to ban 
MANPADS and would not unilaterally "disarm" the Brazilian 
military.  However, based on his non-verbal communication, we 
suspect some internal GOB debate on MANPADS may be blocking 
more positive Brazilian engagement.  (Note: We will also 
provide reftel to MRE's OAS Division, but the issue is 
substantively handled by Mourao's division. End note)
