REF: STATE 39428 
 
 Â¶1. (SBU) On March 21, Poloff delivered reftel demarche 
--regarding the chairmanship of the OAS Working Group to 
draft the OAS Social Charter and Action Plan-- to Counselor 
Mariangela Rebua, Head of the Division of Social Affairs, and 
her Deputy, Adriano Silva Pucci, at Brazil's Foreign 
Ministry.  Rebua and Pucci noted that they were not aware of 
developments on this issue since last year, and that their 
understanding is that the Latin American candidate is 
Venezuela.  However, they emphasized that Brazil is not 
looking to create any "unpleasantness" and that the focus 
should be on addressing poverty, a topic on which everyone 
can agree.  They noted that Brazil will look for 
"constructive consensus" solutions, without being more 
specific.
