¶1.  Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) and its NGO 
partner, Turkish Economic and Social Studies Foundation 
(TESEV), planning for a June Democracy Assistance Dialogue 
(DAD) conference in Istanbul focusing on the role of women in 
society (ref A) appears to be on track. MFA BMENAI 
Coordinator Orhun and TESEV will meet with Turkish womens' 
NGOs in April to decide on the conference format and on a 
public affairs strategy. 
 
¶2.  According to MFA Policy Planning Head Tezel, the MFA 
currently sees no problems with funding for the Istanbul 
conference; he noted that the UK has offered help with 
funding.  Tezel asked us whether the USG would respond to 
funding concerns about the overall DAD initiative expressed 
by NGO No Peace Without Justice (ref B).  We would appreciate 
any information the Department has on this score.
