SUBJECT: PERU REQUESTS USG SUPPORT FOR SPANISH AWARD 
 
 
Action Request in Paragraph 3. 
 
¶1.  The Foreign Ministry, by diplomatic note dated 2/25/05, 
requested that the United States, as a member of the 
International Advisory Committee of the Binational Plan for 
Development of the Peru-Ecuador Frontier ("Binational Plan"), 
support the Andean Development Corporation's (CAF) nomination 
of the Binational Plan for the "Convivencia Ciudad Autonoma 
de Ceuta" prize.  According to the Foreign Ministry, this 
prize is awarded annually by the Fundacion Convivencia of 
Ceuta on the basis of the following criteria:  "those persons 
or institutions of any country whose labor has contributed in 
a relevant and exemplary form to improve human relations, 
fomenting the values of justice, fraternity, peace, liberty, 
access to culture and equality." 
 
¶2.  The Foreign Ministry attached to its diplomatic note a 
copy of a letter from the European Union's Lima Mission to 
the Fundacion Convivencia of Ceuta in support of the CAF's 
nomination of the Binational Plan for the Fundacion's prize. 
In this letter, the EU's Charge d'Affaires, Alain Bothorel, 
highlighted, "the important promoting and coordinating role 
that the Binational Plan is bringing about to develop 
projects that permit the elevation of the standard of living 
of the population, opening a sphere of understanding and 
cooperation in a context of peace and development of the 
frontier region." 
 
¶3.  Embassy requests guidance in responding to the Foreign 
Ministry's note.
