Assistant Minister of Justice Iskandar Ghattas.  Poloff also 
flagged for Ghattas the proposed visit to Cairo April 11-15 
of DOJ Computer Crimes expert Christopher Painter, for 
consultations with the GOE on cybercrime issues and to attend 
an Interpol conference on the same subject. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ghattas did not respond directly to the points in

USG's opposition to a new global convention on cybercrime. 
"We believe cybercrime is an extremely dangerous issue, 
especially for developing countries," Ghattas remarked. 
Ghattas welcomed the potential visit of DOJ's Christopher 
Painter and undertook to help arrange meetings between 
Painter and appropriate Egyptian interlocutors on the issue 
of cybercrime.
