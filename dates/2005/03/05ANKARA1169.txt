Â¶1.  We delivered reftel talking points concerning the 
International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia to 
GOT MFA Balkans officials Kasim Cavusoglu and Gizem Sucuoglu. 
 Both said that Turkey had been following this issue for a 
long time and agreed with the U.S. position, saying that 
people of all ethnic origins should be brought to justice. 
Cavusoglu further commented that "The generals are small 
fish.  Karadzic and Mladic must be taken to The Hague." 
Sucouoglu noted that Turkey had provided funds (NFI), but had 
not contributed personnel to this effort.
