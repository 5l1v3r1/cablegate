Note no. 484/DECOM/CGAP 
 
Rio de Janeiro, March 7, 2005 
 
Ambassador, 
 
I refer to the petition from Elekeiroz S.A., which 
requested initiation of an anti-dumping investigation on 
exports of n-Butanol to Brazil, originating from the U.S.A. 
and South Africa, classified under NCM/SH 2905.13.00 of the 
Common Mercosul Nomenclature. 
 
Pursuant to paragraph 2 of art. 21 of Decree no. 1.602 of 
8/23/95, I am notifying the Embassy that the Secretariat of 
Foreign Trade, of the Ministry of Development, Industry and 
Foreign Trade, decided to initiate an investigation (see 
SECEX Circular no. 10, published in the Diario Oficial da 
Uniao of March 2, 2005, a copy of which is attached), 
according to the sole paragraph of article 61 of the above 
referenced decree. 
 
It should be mentioned that according to art. 31, also 
contained in Decree no. 1.602 of 1995, you or a 
representative designated by you, can request meetings up 
to the date of convocation of the final audience, to be 
advised by this Department, with or without participation 
of the other interested parties, for the purpose of 
discussing essential aspects of the process and stating 
your opinions. 
 
It is worth remembering that according to art. 39 of the 
same decree, the investigation will be concluded within one 
year of its initiation, except in exceptional circumstances 
when the term can be up to eighteen months. 
 
Interested parties should designate their qualifications, 
formally indicating their representatives to DECOM; any 
document forwarded by the parties should be signed by their 
duly licensed representative for this purpose.  In case of 
a power of attorney from abroad, it should clearly identify 
and qualify parties granting and receiving the power of 
attorney, and be legalized by a Brazilian diplomatic 
representative in the respective country. 
 
In accordance with paragraph 4 of art. 21 of Decree 
1.602/95, I am attaching the complete text of the petition 
used to initiate the investigation. 
 
I point out that all interested parties, once qualified, 
can have access to DECOM documents in this investigation, 
which will be available to settle any eventual doubts at 
(55-21) 2126-1298/1297/1301. 
 
Please be advised that according to Art. 27 of Decree no. 
1.602 of 1995, known U.S. manufacturers and exporters, 
listed in Annex I, will be sent a questionnaire for 
purposes of the investigation.  If you know of the 
existence of other U.S. manufacturers and/or exporters of 
n-Butanol, not listed in said Annex, please inform this 
department of their complete name and address, so that they 
may be given an opportunity to respond to the questionnaire 
along with the others.
