¶1.  Embassy regrets the delay in responding to Reftels, which 
was due to a lack of cooperation from the Peruvian Air Force 
and Navy.  The new commands of both institutions, who took 
over this year, have promised to cooperate and have begun to 
provide answers to our Blue Lantern inquiries. 
 
¶2.  Post expects an answer shortly to questions posed in Ref 
B regarding applications 05-924452 and 05-920468 which are 
Air Force procurement issues. 
 
¶3. Answers to Ref B questions on application 05-888772: 
 
DID THE NAVY RECEIVE THE COMMODITIES LISTED IN REF A, 
PARAGRAPH 4 FROM NEDISA PERUANA? 
 
--  Answer:  Yes. Confirmed by Navy Aviation end users. 
 
IS NEDISA PERUANA PERFORMING MAINTENANCE WORK FOR THE 
AIRCRAFT SPECIFIED? 
 
--  Answer:  No, Nedisa Peruana is a parts supplier for the 
Ministry of Defense and has never performed maintenance work. 
 
HOW LONG HAS THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE DONE BUSINESS WITH 
NEDISA PERUANA? 
 
--  Answer:  In 2002 Nedisa bids won several Navy contracts. 
There are still some items that have not been delivered. In 
2003 the Navy stopped doing business with Nedisa, although it 
still hopes to receive the outstanding items. 
 
DOES THE MOD VIEW THE COMPANY AS A RELIABLE SUPPLIER? 
 
Answer: No. The Peruvian Navy does not view Nedisa as a 
reliable supplier.  According to several officers consulted, 
one in Naval Avaiation and one in Navy Procurement, the Navy 
decided to not make any more purchases from Nedisa "due to 
questionable acquisition processes during 2003 where A/C 
(aircraft) second usage (used) parts were presented as new." 
 
DOES THE MOD PLAN TO CONTINUE USING NEDISA PERUANA AS A 
SUPPLIER FOR AIRCRAFT 
PARTS? 
 
Answer:  The Navy believes, but is not positive, that the MOD 
does not/not plan to use Nedisa in the future.  The Peruvian 
Navy definitely is not/not now using and will not/not use 
Nedisa in the future. (Note: The Peruvian Navy has separate 
procurement authority from the rest of the Ministry of 
Defense. End Note.)
