SUBJECT: CHR 61: FRENCH ON GUANTANAMO RESOLUTION 
 
REF: STATE 69823 
 
¶1.  (U) This cable contains an action request.  See para 4. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Poloff delivered reftel points to Donatienne 
Hissard in the Human Rights office of the MFA's United 
Nations and International Organizations bureau on April 19. 
Hissard noted that France agreed completely with our view 
that the Cuban resolution was a retaliatory measure.  While 
there were no technical problems with the resolution, she 
continued, the source and reasons for its introduction 
completely undermined its legitimacy.  Hissard stated 
France's desire to see the EU vote against the resolution as 
a bloc, but said that discussions were ongoing and no 
consensus had yet been reached.  Hissard specifically 
mentioned that Germany "didn't know where it was going" on 
the resolution. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Hissard sought additional information about 
negotiations between the USG and the UN Special Rapporteurs 
regarding their request to visit Guantanamo, remarking that a 
positive response to the request would be detrimental to the 
success of the Cuban resolution.  Hissard also asked if we 
were considering any procedural means to defeat the vote, 
underlining that, in the eyes of some within the EU, a 
postponement vote was akin to a no-action vote. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Action Request: Post seeks information on USG views 
on the UN Special Rapporteurs' request that could be shared 
with the French to assist their lobbying efforts within the 
EU.
