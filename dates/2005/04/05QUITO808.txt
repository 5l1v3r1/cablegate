REF: SECSTATE 64395 
 
Â¶1.  In response to Reftel, the Embassy April 12 transmitted 
non-paper and supporting talking points to the Ecuadorian 
Foreign Ministry's Multilateral Affairs subsecretariat.  In a 
follow-up telcon with Poloff April 14, MFA officer Doug 
Martinez noted Ecuador had yet to formulate a position on the 
amendments, owing mainly to the TDY absence of its technical 
affairs expert, Ruben Herrera.  Other Ministry officials 
would give consideration to our text as they studied the 
matter, but Martinez was unable to state when the process 
might complete.  The Embassy will follow up and report any 
substantive response Septel.
