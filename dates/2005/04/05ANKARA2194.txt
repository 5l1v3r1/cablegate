SUBJECT: EXBS: TURKISH COMMENTS TO LATEST NP COOPERATION 
AND ASSITANCE AGREEMENT 
 
REF: STATE 26836 
 
¶1.  This is an action request- see para 4. 
 
¶2.  We have discussed the latest U.S. draft NP Cooperation 
and Assistance Agreement with MFA DDG for Arms Control and 
Disarmament Bulent Meric and other MFA representatives on 
several occasions since originally delivering it to the GOT 
in February, 2005.  Throughout March, MFA coordinated the 
text with other GOT ministries. On April 6, MFA provided us 
with comments on the latest draft; on April 18, MFA provided 
us with a Turkish translation of the latest draft that we 
faxed to NP/ECC that afternoon. 
 
¶3.  The following are the changes requested by the GOT to the 
text in reftel. (We sent a word document of the text with 
these changes by email to NP/ECC on April 11): 
 
a.  Introduction paragraph 4- line 3 insert the term 
"software" after the term database. 
 
b.  Part II- line 1 insert the term "software" after the term 
database. 
 
c.  Part IV- line 1 insert the term "software" after the term 
database. 
 
¶4.  Action request:  We request the Department review both 
the English and Turkish version of the Agreement and advise 
whether the USG will accept the Agreement as presented.  If 
both versions of the Agreement are acceptable, we request 
authorization to sign the Agreement.  Note:  Following the 
signing by both governments, the GOT will need to submit the 
Agreement to their parliament for final approval. 
 
¶5.  Comment: Both Governments have worked hard on this 
agreement for over two years.  Signing of this agreement 
would mark a significant step in the EXBS program and allow 
an increase in the cooperation efforts in the EXBS program. 
Evaluation and reply as soon as possible would be appreciated.
