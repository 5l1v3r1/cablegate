Â¶1.  (SBU) Former President Lucio Gutierrez' resignation was 
de facto, having been forced to abandon the Presidential 
Palace on the afternoon of April 20 due to large-scale 
protests and the withdrawal of military support.  He did not 
prepare and submit a formal written resignation, as he was 
forced to leave the Presidential palace via helicopter from 
the roof with great haste.  Gutierrez, who is now sought for 
arrest, has made no television or other public declarations 
or appearances since leaving the palace.  Former Presidential 
Secretary Carlos Polit told DCM on April 21 that it was 
 
SIPDIS 
highly unlikely the President would offer a resignation 
letter.
