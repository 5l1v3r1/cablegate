¶1. (U) On April 19, PolOff and EconOff attended a public 
panel discussion of the Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela, 
organized by the local Paraguayan-Venezuelan cultural 
association.  The panel comprised two Venezuelans and a 
member of Paraguay's Chamber of Deputies, Rafael Filizzola of 
the social-democrat oriented Pais Solidario (Country in 
Solidarity) party.  Filizzola aspires to be Mayor of Asuncion 
in 2006.  All three speakers used the event to criticize the 
U.S.  The event was also attended by Senador Domingo Laino, 
who is a member of the leftist wing of the Liberal party and 
a harsh critic of the U.S., and two members of the Paraguayan 
Communist party. 
 
¶2. (U) The two Venezuelan speakers, Dr. Gabriela Moran and 
Ligia Prieto de Centurion, delivered lengthy expositions on 
what they described as the unjust and imperialist 
exploitation of Latin America by European powers in colonial 
times and by the U.S. and other wealthy, powerful countries 
in modern times.  Moran also accused the U.S. of financing 
the April 2002 coup attempt in Venezuela, displaying a 
document that purportedly showed that the U.S. funneled USD 
20 million to anti-Chavez leaders, demonstrators, and media 
outlets through USAID development programs and the like. 
 
¶3. (U) Filizzola expressed support for the Bolivarian 
Revolution as an alternative to the policies of wealthy, 
powerful -- and he added "prepotente" (overbearing or 
arrogant) -- countries and the IFIs.  He pointed to Lula, 
Kirchner, and Vazquez's electoral victories as "encouraging" 
signs for the region, and praised Chavez's proposals for a 
regional news channel and a regional development bank as ways 
to "break the imperialist bonds."  He also criticized the GOP 
for maintaining diplomatic relations with Taiwan, rather than 
with mainland China, since, in his opinion, Paraguay "has 
much more to learn from (the latter's) economic model." 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment: As attendance was light (roughly 30 people) 
and there was no press coverage of the discussion, it is 
unlikely that the event will have any impact.  Filizzola is a 
smart, savvy young politician who likely has a long political 
career ahead of him, despite his party's limited following 
outside Asuncion.  In prior meetings with EmbOffs, Filizzola 
was more guarded, and therefore seemed less hostile to U.S. 
policy.  His commentary during the panel discussion was 
consistent with positions espoused by other members of Pais 
Solidario, and probably more accurately reflects his true 
colors.  The party's founder and leader is Senator Carlos 
Filizzola, Rafael's cousin.
