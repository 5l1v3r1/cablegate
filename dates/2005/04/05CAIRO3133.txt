START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Nominee is a model for empowering women through media and 
their contribution to the society in all aspects.  She has 
a good chance to hold a position in one of the TV's 
channels. Her participation in a program related to 
empowerment of women will help her understand the rights of 
women and the importance in their participation in the 
political process.  She is considered a young 
"social/political" influential leader in her professional 
community.  An IV program would educate her on new 
"democracies" and engage her in dialogues with American 
influential young leaders to encounter new ideas, which she 
might be able to apply in her community.  Program would 
also assist in addressing social and economic challenges 
facing women in general and means to face them.  Since she 
is a media figure, program could enhance her creativity and 
awareness of the impact of the media on the advancement of 
women's rights
