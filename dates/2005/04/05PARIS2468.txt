(U) MFA Action Officer on Middle East reform issues Brigitte 
Curmi confirmed to us April 11 that a working-level expert 
from the MFA Directorate of International Cooperation will 
attend the April 24-26, 2005 G8-BMENA Literacy Workshop in 
Algiers (reftel), along with a representative from the French 
embassy in Algiers.  Curmi welcomed the updated information 
on U.S. participation, and asked for a list of U.S. 
participants.  She confirmed that the GoF was not planning to 
make a presentation on the topics outlined reftel at the 
Algiers meeting.  She clarified that the MFA instead was 
working on a paper for presentation at the May G8-BMENA 
education ministerial, which would outline the French vision 
and experience on education reform, and stress the need to 
take a comprehensive approach.
