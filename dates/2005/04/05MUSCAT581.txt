SUBJECT: QABOOS PUBLICLY HAILS NEW IRAQI PRESIDENT 
 
 
¶1. (U) Sultan Qaboos sent a congratulatory cable of greetings 
on April 8 to Jalal Talabani on the occasion of his election 
as president of Iraq, "wishing him good health and success in 
fulfilling the aspirations of the people of Iraq for 
stability, progress and prosperity," according to the Oman 
News Agency.  The Sultan sent a similar message to new Iraqi 
PM Ibrahim Jaafari. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Minister Responsible for Foreign Affairs Yusuf bin 
Alawi had previously assured the Ambassador that Oman would 
be among the first to congratulate a new Iraqi government. 
Having now come through on that pledge, we will watch to see 
if disbursal of Oman's Iraq reconstruction pledge 
(approximately USD 5 million) is likewise soon fulfilled.
