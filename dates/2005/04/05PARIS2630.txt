SUBJECT:  SEEKING CLARIFICATION ON SECURITY REGULATIONS AND 
REQUIREMENTS FOR PRIVATE AIR TRAVEL TO THE U.S. 
 
 
NOT FOR INTERNET DISTRIBUTION 
 
¶1.  (U) This is a request for guidance.  See para 4. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) We were recently made aware of at least one case 
in which the CEO of one of France's largest companies, with 
significant investments and business interests in the U.S., 
was denied permission to fly, in a private European- 
registered aircraft, to the U.S.  The traveler's subsequent 
investigation into the refusal and the overall USG 
requirements for private (not-for-profit, or Part 91) 
operation into the U.S. was extremely confusing to both the 
traveler and his staff.  The traveler was confused about the 
several-day approval period for an International Fleet 
Waiver, the status about the waiver's applicability to 
members of the crew, and when a flight routing itinerary is 
required rather than requested.  The CEO approached the 
Ambassador seeking clarification, and even with substantial 
substantive resources at Post, we found it difficult to 
explain exactly what the requirements are. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) We understand that tighter controls on all air 
travel into the U.S. has become a necessity and a reality 
after September 11.  However, we are concerned that opaque 
and downright impenetrable rules and requirements may be 
dissuading and preventing travel to the U.S. by individuals 
who need to travel there (often on short notice) for 
legitimate business reasons.  Typically some of these 
individuals and their firms are heavily invested in the U.S. 
and responsible for the creation of American jobs. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Action request:  We would be grateful if relevant 
Washington agencies could coordinate and develop clear, 
concise, requirements and procedures for not-for-profit 
private aircraft travel to the U.S. that could be provided 
to Embassies.   Ultimately, we would want to be able to 
place such requirements on our website or to be able to 
explain the requirements when asked.  (For example, visa 
requirements for such individuals, indeed for all French 
citizens, are available on our website and comparatively 
easy to understand.)  Ideally, we would be able to pass a 
one or two-page information sheet to important contacts who 
need to make such travel to the U.S.  We would be grateful 
if Washington agencies could provide us with clear, concise 
guidance and information on relevant U.S. requirements that 
would give particular emphasis to the time required (i.e. 
how many days in advance) for obtaining necessary waivers 
and approvals.
