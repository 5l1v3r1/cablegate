¶1. (SBU) On 4/19, D/Polcoun delivered reftel points and 
concept paper on the U.S. proposal for developing election 
standards and assessment mechanisms to Foreign Ministry Human 
Rights and Social Affairs Director Carlos Roman.  Roman told 
Emboff on 4/21 that he had forwarded the U.S. proposal to 
Foreign Minister Manuel Rodriguez, as part of a briefing 
package on the Santiago Community of Democracies meeting. 
Roman said the evaluation of the USG initiative he had given 
the Minister was generally favorable, but he had noted 
concerns about possible duplication of the roles of existing 
institutions, such as the Carter Center and Transparency 
International.  Roman hoped the U.S. would provide more 
details on the make-up, the mandate, and the criteria for 
intervention of this proposed group of international election 
experts, as the GOP would need this kind of information 
before it could fully commit to supporting our initiative. 
 
¶2. (SBU) COMMENT:  We suggest that the USDel to the Santiago 
Ministerial engage with the Peruvians on the election 
standards initiative in order to assuage their concerns about 
duplication of roles.
