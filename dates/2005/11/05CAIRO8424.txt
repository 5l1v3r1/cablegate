Citing the pressing humanitarian nature of the Pakistan 
earthquake relief effort, the Ambassador pressed Minister of 
Defense Field Marshal Tantawi on November 2 to seriously 
consider Centcom's request for MI-17 helicopter parts in 
support of the relief effort.  Tantawi responded 
sympathetically and promised to look into the matter 
immediately.  Post is also continuing to stress the need for 
additional support (Ref A) and will report any substantive 
response after the local Eid al Fitr holiday (November 6).
