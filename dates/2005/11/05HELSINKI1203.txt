¶1.  (C)  Poloff spoke with officials in the Office for 
Caribbean and Central American Affairs at Finland's MFA and 
confirmed that there have been no changes in Finland's policy 
toward Cuba since Reftel was drafted in May.  There have been 
no high-level contacts between Finnish and Cuban officials in 
the past six months.  Finland does not have an Embassy in 
Havana and has little direct contact with the Cuban 
Government.  There is no direct bilateral assistance from 
Finland to Cuba.  Finland supports and will continue to 
support the EU common position on Cuba. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Finland's Customs Agency reports the following level 
of trade with Cuba from January-August 2005: 
 
Imports: 917,000  Euro 
Exports: 2.4 million Euro 
 
Imports from Cuba are down 90% from 2004;  exports are down 
27%.
