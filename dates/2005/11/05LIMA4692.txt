     ¶B. LIMA 4644 
 
¶1.  Iranian President Ahmadi-Nejad's public call for Israel 
to be "wiped off the map" (Ref A) was discussed at a 10/28 
breakfast hosted by the Ambassador for Foreign Minister Oscar 
Maurtua and leading Foreign Ministry officials (Ref B). 
Maurtua expressed disapproval of the Iranian leader's 
statement, and stated that Peru looked forward to working 
with the U.S. on international security issues during its 
upcoming stint on the Security Council in 2006-2007. 
 
¶2.  On 10/29, the Foreign Ministry issued a press statement 
advising that Foreign Minister Maurtua met that day with 
Israeli Ambassador Walid Mansour to inform him that the 
Peruvian Government "profoundly deplored" Ahmadi-Nejad's 
declarations regarding Israel.  According to the Ministry, 
Maurtua characterized Ahmadi-Nejad's statements as being, 
"contrary to the principles of the United Nations Charter, 
unacceptable to the international community and do not 
contribute to create a climate of detente necessary for the 
installation of peace and security in the Middle East."  The 
Foreign Minister further stated that, "Inadequate threats 
such as that announced by the Iranian Government, are not 
conducive to respect for the norms of peaceful co-existence 
that should prevail between States, the more so when both 
countries are members of the United Nations."
