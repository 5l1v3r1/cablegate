 ¶1.  (SBU) With respect to other countries cited for generous 
thanks in ref A, Post notes that Turkey remains first in the 
line of donors with a plege of $150 million. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On November 17, MFA Officer Sebnem Incesu 
reiterated Turkey's commitment to assisting Pakistan for both 
humanitarian and reconstruction needs from the earthquake. 
She said that Turkey's delegation led by the Deputy Prime 
Minister had already departed for the November 19 Pakistan 
Reconstruction Conference.  She said that the GOT had held 
discussions with Pakistan officials, but the Prime Ministry 
had still not released further details for a break-down of 
the $150 million pledge.  The MFA official said that $68 
million of bilateral assistance had been funded (the same 
figure as in Ref B) and that 24 plane-loads of materials had 
been transported.  She said that public fund-raising had 
totalled $87 million, but was not able to clarify if that 
constituted part of the $150 million pledge.  Incesu said 
that the $3 million response from Turkey for the UN flash 
appeal was being transfered this week (Ref B). 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Post notes that Turkey's response to Pakistan's 
crisis has struck a deep chord with the Turkish people, 
eliciting a generous pledge.  It is surprising that more 
details have not been fleshed out at this time, particularly 
with respect to reconstruction needs.
