REF: STATE 206962 
 
DCM delivered reftel demarche to the MFA's Assistant Minister 
for American Affairs Aly Al Hefny on November 13.  The 
Assistant Minister listened to the message and promised to 
convey the points to FM Aboul Gheit and other appropriate 
offices.  He asked if there has been an agreement between the 
Palestinians and Israelis on the use of the MDA symbol in the 
"occupied territories."  He said he believed there would be 
no progress on the issue of the MDA until this issue could be 
resolved.  The DCM and PolCouns pushed back that this was a 
humanitarian issue, not political; that the discussion in 
Geneva was separate from the discussion of the use of the 
symbol in the territories.  Al Hefny agreed to convey the 
points to the Foreign Minister and noted the Ambassador had 
raised the issue with the Minister recently.
