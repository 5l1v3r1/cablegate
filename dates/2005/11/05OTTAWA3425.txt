REF: OTTAWA 3421 
 
(SBU)  Reftel reported that the GOC was considering 
announcing an additional C$25 million in emergency relief at 
the Pakistan reconstruction conference.  We have just learned 
that Canada will not announce that funding at this time, but 
will commit to a major pledge in the near future, with 
details to be determined after they have absorbed the 
recommendations in the WB/ADB reconstruction report.
