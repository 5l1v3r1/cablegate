Summary 
 
¶2.  (U) All of the figures in this cable come from BCCR's 
most recent quarterly "Survey of Economic Perspectives 
http://www.bccr.fi.cr/ndie/Documentos/Informe %20Encuesta%20I 
II-05.pdf (specifically "Grfico No. 11" entitled "The 
current Investment Climate" on page 11) and reports from 
earlier quarterly found at 
http://www.bccr.fi.cr/ndie/encuesta_perspecti vas.htm. 
 
¶3.  (U) According to the third quarter 2005 report, only 4.2 
percent of the Costa Rican respondents believe now is a good 
time to invest in Costa Rica.  More importantly, those who 
believe that now is a bad time to invest reached a new high 
of 75.0 percent.  Opinions have solidified over the last 
year with those saying they were "Unsure" reaching a new low 
of 20.8 percent. 
 
¶4.  (U) Analyzing BCCR data on investor confidence over the 
last 12 quarters shows that confidence peaked at 61.0% in 
the first quarter of 2004 when Costa Rica concluded CAFTA 
negotiations with the U.S.  Confidence sunk to the low 
double-digits for the next two quarter as negotiations to 
conclude CAFTA-DR continued.  Once CAFTA-DR negotiations 
concluded and the agreement was signed on August 5, 2004, it 
soon became clear that the Pacheco administration had no 
intention of pushing CAFTA forward.  Confidence dove in the 
fourth quarter of 2004 into the low single digits where it 
has remained ever since. 
 
¶5.  (U) Here is the trend over the last 12 quarters to the 
questions "Is now a good time to invest in Costa Rica?":

COMMENT

¶6.  (SBU) The Central Bank of Costa Rica's figures are the 
clearest indication we have seen of the harm done to Costa 
Rica's investment climate by the current administration's 
"go slow" approach to CAFTA and languishing fiscal reform.
