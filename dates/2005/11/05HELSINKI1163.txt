SUBJECT: FINLAND CONDEMNS IRANIAN PRESIDENT'S EXTREMISM 
 
REF: STATE 199225 
 
¶1. (U) The GOF has roundly condemned Iranian President 
Ahmadi-Nejad's October 25 call for Israel to be "wiped off 
the map."  On Oct. 27, Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja 
released a public statement that expressed the GOF's "deep 
disapproval of the Iranian president's comment;" emphasized 
that "under no circumstances are threats of violence 
acceptable;" and lamented the negative impact it will have on 
relations between Iran and the EU.  On Oct. 31, MFA State 
Secretary (D equivalent) Arto Mansala called in Iranian 
 
SIPDIS 
Ambassador Javad Fini Oct. 31 to deliver an even more 
strongly worded statement and to demand an explanation. 
 
¶2. (SBU) MFA Regional Manager for the Middle East Leena 
Pylvanainen told PolChief privately that Mansala's meeting 
with Fini was brief and somewhat tense.  The Iranian, she 
said, was evasive, limiting himself largely to defending 
Ahmadi-Nejad's comments and making "no reasonable 
explanation" or apology for them.  She added that the GOF 
fully agrees with the substance of reftel's talking points 
and that Mansala delivered an unmistakable message along 
similar lines.
