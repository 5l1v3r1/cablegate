DEMARCHE RESPONSE 
 
REF: STATE 207928 
 
(SBU) On November 17 poloff delivered reftel talking points 
to Faruque Faquira, Head of Department, Directorate for 
International Organizations and Conferences, Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs.  Faquira stated he was following this issue 
closely and had been in contact recently with the Mozambican 
Mission in New York on the vote.  He indicated that 
Mozambique traditionally abstains on issues of this nature, 
and said he saw no reason why things would be different this 
time.  Though he did admit that Mozambique often votes as a 
block with other African nations, he did not believe that 
this would affect the final outcome, stating it was "very 
unlikely" that Mozambique would support a no-action motion on 
the Iran resolution because Mozambique attaches great 
importance to human rights issues.
