SUBJECT: FINNISH REACTION TO PRE-GAERC DEMARCHE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 208899 
 
Classified By: POLOFF DAVID ALLEN SCHLAEFER FOR REASON 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
 
¶1.  (C)  Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Tanya 
Jaaskelainen, Deputy EU Correspondent in the MFA's Unit for 
EU Common Foreign and Security Policy.  The points were also 
sent to the EU Coordinator in the Prime Minister's Office. 
Jaaskelainen said that Finland would focus on the MEPP, 
Kosovo, and Ukraine at the Nov. 21-22 GAERC.  She also 
commented on Syria. 
 
¶2.  (C)  MEPP:  Finland welcomed the "Agreement on Movement 
and Access" announced by the Secretary on Nov. 15.  Garnering 
sufficient financial and logistical support for the EU 
mission in Rafah is an important next step.  Finland will 
contribute to the Rafah mission and urge other EU countries 
to do the same.  It is important that the momentum 
established by the Rafah agreement be maintained;  Gaza is a 
good beginning, but not the endgame.  The EU and US must 
continue to work with Israel to address the full range of 
outstanding issues related to the Occupied Territories. 
 
¶3.  (C)  Kosovo:  The GoF is pleased that the EU quickly 
responded to UN Special Envoy Ahtisaari's request for support 
by appointing Stefan Lehne as EU Special Representative.  The 
Finns welcome a pending announcement of a U.S. Special Envoy. 
 Jaaskelainen remarked that the U.S. has supported Ahtisaari 
strongly in his prior missions on behalf of the international 
community, especially during the successful Aceh talks, and 
that the GoF was confident that he would continue to receive 
such support from Washington.  Finland aims to keep the EU 
ministers focused on the issue with a view toward providing 
maximum EU support and cooperation for Ahtisaari. 
 
¶4.  (C)  Ukraine:  Finland shares U.S. concern about the slow 
pace of WTO-related reform and anti-corruption measures.  The 
U.S. and EU must work in tandem to encourage greater energy 
toward reform in Ukraine.  Trans-Atlantic consultation is 
important in order to avoid duplication of programs and 
ensure maximum effect. 
 
¶5.  (C)  Syria:  The GoF agrees that it is important for 
Syria to cooperate fully with the UN investigation.  Finland 
has supported strong EU statements about this.  The GoF (and 
EU) has a different perspective as regards isolating the 
Syrians, however.  Total isolation may lead to missed 
opportunities to encourage the Syrians to cooperate on the 
Hariri investigation and on other issues, including support 
for militants in Lebanon.
