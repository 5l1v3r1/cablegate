¶1. (U)  On November 7, Poloff delivered reftel demarches to 
Ambassador Abdul bin Rimdap, Director for International 
Organizations at the Nigerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
Ambassador Rimdap was aware of the Iranian President's 
inflammatory remarks but said that the GON had not yet 
publicly reacted to them, in part because the GON is 
anticipating some additional statement or clarification of 
those remarks by the Iranian Foreign Minister. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ambassador Rimdap noted that Nigeria has relations 
with Israel and that they also have a very good bilateral 
relationship with Iran.  He explained that Nigeria and Iran 
work together as part of the "D-8" group of developing 
countries.  He also said that Nigeria recently abstained from 
a vote at the IAEA to refer the matter of Iran's nuclear 
activities to the UNSC.  He explained that the GON did not 
want to upset relations with Iran by voting to refer Iran to 
the Security Council. He implied that Nigeria would be 
equally hesitant to upset Iran on this occasion by condemning 
the Iranian President's statement of October 26.
