Â¶1.  (SBU) PolChief delivered RefTel points on November 8 to 
Undersecretary for Multilateral Affairs Mauricio MontalvoPer 
RefTel request, PolChief stressed the USG's hope that the GOE 
vote for the resolution on Iran's human rights record.  After 
clarifying that the Third Committee resolution deals only 
with Iran's deplorable human rights record, Montalvo said GOE 
support would "not be a problem" and that he would consult 
with Ecuador's mission in New York on the two U.S. sponsored 
thematic resolutions, as well as those on Turkmenistan, North 
Korea, Uzbekistan, and Burma.
