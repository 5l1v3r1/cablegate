As reported in Ref B, Spain is committed to supporting the 
demobilization process in Colombia through direct financial 
contributions as well as training and other programs. 
Spanish Prime Minister Zapatero told Colombian President 
Uribe that Spain would donate one million euros to the OAS 
demobilization initiative.  Spanish MFA Deputy DG for the 
Andean Community Juan Carlos Sanchez told poloff that he 
still is not sure how the funds will be disbursed, but that 
he will be meeting with the Spanish aid agency in early 
December to discuss this point.  Embassy will follow up with 
Sanchez at that time.
