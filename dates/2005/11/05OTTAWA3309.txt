Canada shares with the United States the heritage of the 
indigenous people who inhabited North America before the 
advent of European settlers.  Today, native Americans and 
Canada's "First Nations" and aboriginal peoples face similar 
challenges in adapting and harmonizing their traditional 
lifestyles and values with the economic and cultural demands 
of the modern milieu in which they find themselves. 
Canadians, like Americans, continue to discuss approaches to 
preserving and respecting indigenous heritage while at the 
same time seeking viable economic and social avenues for 
integrating them into modern society. 
Winnipeg is the capital and largest city in the Canadian 
province of Manitoba.  Fully 680,000 of Manitoba's 1.2 
million people live in Winnipeg, and the city has become the 
destination of choice for thousands of aboriginals (as they 
are now known in Canada) fleeing poverty in Manitoba's 
remote northern reserves.  Winnipeg's rapidly growing Indian 
population now makes up one-tenth of the city's total, and 
at current rates, could approach 100,000 (one-sixth of the 
total population) by 2020. 
The post proposes a program to allow influential Winnipeg 
city councillor Lillian Thomas to engage with U.S. federal, 
state and local officials to better understand the range of 
programs and institutions in the United States which help 
native Americans adapt to urban lifestyles.  The program 
supports the post's interest in promoting dialogue and 
possible trade and economic exchange between Canada and the 
U.S., as well as the MPP goal focused on broadening Canadian 
understanding of the values and attitudes that underlie U.S. 
policy goals and objectives.  Ms. Thomas' travel may also 
open new opportunities for American Indian groups to expand 
cross-border contacts in trade. 
Since being appointed by Winnipeg's mayor as Secretary of 
Urban Aboriginal Opportunities for the city of Winnipeg, 
Thomas has worked to develop a better understanding of the 
issues confronting Indians migrating to the city from remote 
reservations.  She has been keen to learn of different 
approaches taken in different cities in Canada, and now is 
eager to learn about what is being done in the United 
States.  She is particularly interested in innovative 
programs that have proven successful in U.S. cities and that 
could be usefully adapted to Winnipeg's situation. 
Post proposes Washington, DC and Arizona for the exchange 
sites, but welcomes suggestions from ECA/PE/V/F/A on 
destinations that can best accommodate Thomas's interests. 
Other U.S. sites Thomas expressed interest in include the 
Indian Housing Loan Guarantee program being initiated by the 
Office of Native American programs in Denver, and the 
Seattle Indian Center, which provides a wide variety of 
services to native people. 
Arizona shares several similarities with Manitoba.  In both 
jurisdictions, Indians make up a larger percentage of the 
population than the national average, are moving in large 
numbers from rural reservations to the cities, and are 
having similar problems adjusting to life in urban 
environments.  In both locations, the recent migrants from 
remote reservations struggle with the consequences of 
addiction, poverty and homelessness.  We believe it would be 
useful for Thomas to see the approach taken by U.S. cities 
to their native American populations, and also to develop 
contacts with those involved in developing and implementing 
services designed to help alleviate the problems, spawning 
contacts that will endure beyond the immediate future. 
After the program concludes, Thomas will be in a position to 
convey to Canadian native groups, the media and the general 
public what she saw and learned on her visit.  We anticipate 
this will create a significant multiplier effect beyond 
Thomas herself.   She will also be in a position to 
implement the ideas she has seen in U.S. cities when she 
returns to Winnipeg.  Winnipeg has the largest urban Indian 
population of any Canadian city, and other Canadian cities 
are looking to Winnipeg for ideas on how to aid the 
transition.  Ms. Thomas has expressed a willingness to share 
her experiences with the network of professional colleagues 
she has developed in the field across Canada.  English is 
Ms. Thomas' primary language.  An escort officer, if 
available, may help the participant navigate the cities, but 
is not required.
