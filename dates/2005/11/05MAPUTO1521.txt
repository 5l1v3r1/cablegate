DEMARCHE RESPONSE 
 
REF: A. STATE 206948 
     ¶B. MAPUTO 01060 
 
¶1. On November 17 poloff delivered ref A talking points to 
Faruque Faquira, Head of Department, Directorate for 
International Organizations and Conferences, Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs.  Faquira said the GRM had recently received 
the Swiss Government's note on this issue and indicated that 
Mozambique's position of supporting a diplomatic conference 
had not changed (ref B).  Faquira, however, was unable to 
confirm whether the GRM would support the adoption of a Third 
Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions, though he 
implied that Mozambique did support the universality of the 
Red Cross/Red Cresent Movement.  Faquira promised to relay 
the USG message to his counterpart in Geneva. 
 
¶2. Despite Mozambique's apparent support for the conference 
and perhaps even the Protocol itself, it is highly unlikely 
that the GRM will take an active role at the upcoming 
conference.  The GRM has openly admitted that it does not 
have sufficient staff to focus on this issue at present.  End 
Comment.
