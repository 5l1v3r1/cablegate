(SBU)  During a November 27 meeting with Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs Undersecretary Khaled Al-Jarallah, the Ambassador 
informed him of the impending signature of a memorandum of 
understanding between the Israeli National Society, Magen 
David Adom (MDA), and the Palestinian Red Crescent Society 
(ref A).  He said the agreement gives momentum to the 
discussions on adopting the third additional protocol to the 
Geneva Conventions and paves the way for resolving the 
longstanding issue.  He added that approving the use of the 
"red crystal" would facilitate the humanitarian work of not 
only the MDA, but also of other national societies in Europe 
and Africa.  He encouraged the GOK to review the matter and 
support the additional protocol at the December 5 - 6 
diplomatic conference in Geneva.  Al-Jarallah seemed 
interested in the recent developments and promised to review 
the issue and the GOK position.
