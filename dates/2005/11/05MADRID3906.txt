We delivered on October 14 reftel talking points to Isabel

Relations at the Customs and Special Taxes Department.  In a 
follow up telephone conversation, Assistant of Deputy 
Director Pablo Herrera told us off-the-record the issue is 
being discussed at the European Union level and that later 
on the EU will decide if the Framework will be signed.  He 
added that each country at an individual level is not
