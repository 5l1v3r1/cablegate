 ¶1.  (U)  Poloff spoke with MFA desk officer for Bolivia 
Anu-Vuori Kiikeri on November 28 about the rescheduled Dec. 
18 elections.  Kiikeri had just returned from a visit to La 
Paz where she attended a meeting of EU ambassadors.  She said 
that Finland will not send election monitors to Bolivia. 
Finland has already expended all available 2005 funds for 
monitoring missions in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 
the absence of a Finnish Embassy in La Paz makes any 
bilateral monitoring mission all the more expensive and 
logistically difficult. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Kiikkeri told Poloff that she agreed with the 
conventional wisdom that Evo Morales would win the election. 
She said that she was less worried about the danger of fraud 
or corruption during the election than the prospect that 
Bolivia's legislature would refuse to certify Morales 
afterward, sparking large-scale unrest and riots.  Finland 
will continue to monitor the situation through its Embassy in 
Lima.
