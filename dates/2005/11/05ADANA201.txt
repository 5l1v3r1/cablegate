police station 300 kilometers away from the Van Security

casualties. 
 
ZAMAN:  BBP (Grand Unity Party) reacted to the press's 
recent reporting on the new party logo of the newly formed DTP 
(Democratic Society Party), which used a rose image.  Deputy 
national chairperson of BBP said that the rose was a symbol 
identified with their own party logo and it was unacceptable for 
them to share that identity with "supporters of separatism."

to make a presentation at the Summmit of International Union of 
Municipalities and Local Administration Boards about relevant

in Hakkari's Yuksekova district.

fight between children that led to a bigger fight with guns and 
knives between members of two clans in Adana.

gathered at the headquarters of THAYD-DER in Adana and protested

and relatives be allowed to meet with Ocalan. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:   The daily reported that a man locked his 
daughter to a chicken coop in Hakkari's Yuksekova district.

that she was mentally ill.  Since then, the father kept his 
daughter locked in a chicken's coop.  However, the neighbors and
