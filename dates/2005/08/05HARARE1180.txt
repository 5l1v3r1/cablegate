SUBJECT: RUMORED DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN NATIONAL PARK

Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force (ZCTF) Vice 
President Johnny Rodriguez claimed in July in a widely 
distributed newsletter that the GOZ was planning an 
agricultural development project in the middle of the Mana 
Pools National Park.  This claim remains unsubstantiated and 
appears to be based on a proposal, rejected two-years ago, to 
turn an old failed sugar estate in the park into a winter 
maize farm.  End Summary

Alleged Development Plan for Protected Area 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) In early July 2005, ZCTF Vice President Johnny 
Rodriguez claimed in a widely distributed newsletter that the 
GOZ planned to start a massive agricultural project in the 
middle of the environmentally sensitive Mana Pools National 
Park.  The notice raised an alarm in local and international 
environmental circles.  In the newsletter, Rodriguez alleged 
that Vice President Joyce Mujuru had sanctioned the 
refurbishment of an old sugar plantation in the Chirundu area 
within the park and in neighboring GOZ-designated Safari 
Areas near Zimbabwe,s northwestern border with Zambia. 
Rodriguez further alleged to PolOff on July 12 that the plans 
were complete and work was ready to begin.  He promised to 
provide proof of the project within a week, but has failed to 
follow up with any evidence despite several further requests.

The Apparent Situation 
----------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Zimbabwe National Parks and Wildlife Authority 
Chairman of the Board George Pangeti told PolOff on August 18 
that there was no development project underway in Chirundu. 
He added that he was concerned that Rodriguez,s announcement 
and the ensuing publicity could damage the Authority,s 
reputation and impede its work on other programs.  According 
to Pangeti, the source of the rumor was a meeting in 2003 in 
which a group of investors had proposed turning a failed 
sugar estate within the Park into a winter maize farm.  The 
National Parks Authority nixed the plan based on its 
environmental impact on a sensitive area.  Pangeti added that 
as far as he knew no other such project was under 
consideration and that he had personally confirmed this with 
Agriculture Minister Made and Environment and Tourism 
Minister Nhema. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In a separate August 18 meeting, University of 
Zimbabwe Environment Professor Cummings confirmed Pangeti,s 
account of the 2003 proposal.  However, he did not discount 
the possibility that someone could now be talking up the 
project to access concessional financing without, however, 
any intention of actually going forward with the project. 
(N.B. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe is granting loans for 
agriculture production at five percent interest while market 
rates are over 200 percent.)

Comment

¶5. (SBU) While the evidence doesn't appear to bear out 
Rodriguez's allegations in this case, we fully expect more 
disputes of this sort to emerge.  Disappointed in their 
ability to exploit their farms under land reform, ruling 
party bigwigs increasingly have been scheming to grab and 
exploit environmentally sensitive areas that they believe 
could generate hard currency revenue from tourism, especially 
hunting.
