REF: SECSTATE 145390 
 
¶1.  Canada recently announced C$15 (about US$ 12) in new 
projects to support Haiti.  Minister for International 
Cooperation Aileen Carroll announced C$5 million (about US$ 4 
million) to fund new job creation.  The GOC will also commit 
C$5 million to rehabilitate Haiti's electrical system, in 
coordination with the U.S.  An additional C$5 million will 
support schools.  Most (C$3.6 million) will be 
quasi-budgetary support for public education to cover items 
such as salaries, scholarships and pedagogical equipment and 
C$1.5 million to support private education. 
 
¶2.  Overall, Canada has committed C$180 million to Haiti this 
fiscal year (through March 31, 2006).  Of that, C$100 million 
(about US$ 80 million) has been disbursed and the rest will 
be disbursed by the end of the fiscal year.  On her recent 
trip to Haiti, Minister Carroll announced a further C$40 
million in projects, including the C$5 million for job 
creation mentioned above.  The proposals for electricity and 
schools will be drawn from the remaining C$40 million.
