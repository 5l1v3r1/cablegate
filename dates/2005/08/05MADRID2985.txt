¶1. Trade policy officer discussed contents of ref B on August 
12 with the GOS working-level head of the interministerial 
working group charged with coordinating Codex issues.  His 
name is Juan Carlos Calvo (Ministry of Health).  Tel : 34 - 
¶9133808883.  E-mail: jcalvo@msc.es  He will not be attending 
the meeting in Japan.  Maria Dolores Gomez (Ministry of 
Health; Tel: 34 - 913380836; e-mail: mgomezv@msc.es) and 
Maria Teresa Calvo (Ministry of Agriculture; Tel: 34 - 
913475045; e-mail: tcalvosa@mapya.es) will represent Spain. 
 
¶2. Calvo said that the GOS is going to coordinate its final 
positions in an inter-ministerial meeting on August 26 in 
advance of an EU meeting on the subject in Brussels on 
September 1.  He added that the GOS and the EU support our 
proposal on staples.  Moroever, labeling and the environment 
should be dealt with in other Codex committees or other 
international bodies as far as the GOS and the EU were 
concerned. Calvo had no information on GOS views with respect 
to developing guidance for the food safety assessment of low 
levels of material derived from transgenic plants. 
 
¶3. Comment: Embassy's sense is that as Health and Agriculture 
are representing Spain, GOS policies will be science-oriented 
and pragmatic  However, Spain has a history of not rocking 
the boat within the EU unless the issue is of great national 
importance so the EU "consensus" coming out of the September 
1 meeting will shape Spain's views.  We have little sense for 
how active Spain will be in the September 1 meeting in 
Brussels.
