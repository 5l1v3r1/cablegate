SUBJECT: SPAIN:  AFGHANISTAN TRAGEDY OFFERS OPPORTUNITY FOR 
HIGHEST LEVEL OUTREACH 
 
¶1. (SBU) The tragic loss of 17 Spanish military personnel in 
the helicopter crash in Afghanistan offers the opportunity 
for the US to reach out to the Spanish public through their 
senior leadership as we express our condolences on the loss 
of life and our support for Spain's continued commitment to 
the task in Afghanistan.  Your outreach to Moratinos and Dan 
Fried's to National Security advisor Casajuana reinforced 
this message.  They were both extremely grateful to receive 
the calls. 
 
¶2. (SBU) President Zapatero has just appeared on national TV 
with a firm statement underscoring the courage of Spanish 
troops in a humanitarian mission to bring about peace and 
stability and an end to tyranny and violence in Afghanistan. 
He also saluted their efforts in Haiti, Bosnia and Kosovo. 
At this point, Zapatero and Defense Minister Bono's rapid 
reaction seems aimed at maintaining public support for this 
Spanish Parliament-approved mission.  They are also seeking 
to avert the kind of political controversy that embroiled the 
previous government over the alleged mismanagement of an 
Afghanistan related plane crash in 2003, in which 62 Spanish 
military personnel lost their lives. Personal outreach by the 
President to Zapatero, as the head of the Spanish government, 
would send a welcome public diplomacy signal as we work to 
create a positive environment in which the Spanish government 
can cooperate with the US on issues of vital concern to us. 
You will be in the best position to recommend the form and 
content of that personal outreach.   As always, I am grateful 
for your support and that of our colleagues in EUR. 
AGUIRRE
