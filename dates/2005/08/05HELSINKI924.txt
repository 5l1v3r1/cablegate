¶1. (SBU) PolChief met August 24 with MFA Human Rights Unit 
Director Johanna Suurpaa and Legal Officer Janina Hasenson to 
request additional assurances regarding the 15 Uzbek refugees 
in Kyrgystan.  Both reiterated their office's willingness to 
draft a note to Kyrgyz authorities in accordance with the 
guidelines outlined in Ref A.  However, they highlighted 
minor problems that might delay slightly the note's delivery. 
 First, Finnish refugee resettlement law, like that of many 
countries, does not permit the granting of refugee status 
without a UNHCR determination.  The MFA's legal office is 
already working with the Human Rights Unit to find a 
compromise on suitable language, but this may take a few 
days.  Second, Finland intends to consult with the 
Netherlands and Sweden on both the language and the form of 
communication before delivering anything to the Kyrgyz 
procurator general.  Finally, they said, Finland's 
non-resident ambassador was seeking clarifications from the 
Kyrgyz MFA regarding the issue. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Suurpaa suggested that there was some hope that 
Kyrgyz authorities might simply relent and release the 15 
Uzbeks to UNHCR, based on previous assurances and in response 
to the pressure currently being applied by UNHCR, the U.S. 
and the resettlement countries.  If not, however, she and 
Hasenson expressed confidence that Finland, Sweden and the 
Netherlands would eventually come up with an adequate joint 
response that would serve to secure the Uzbeks' release.
