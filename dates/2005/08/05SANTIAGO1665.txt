On August 5, conservative, influential "El Mercurio" 
(circ. 116,807) ran a column by pundit Andres 
Oppenheimer entitled, "Tele-Bush to Stop Tele-Chavez?" 
Quote: 
 
"A U.S. TV channel - which would end up being called 
Tele-Bush - would be counterproductive, at least while 
there still exist remnants of press freedom in 
Venezuela.  As a frequent CNN political analyst I do not 
agree with Chavez' stance that CNN reflects the White 
House's opinions....  However, Telesur should be left to 
its own fate....  If the U.S. Congress wants to confront 
Chavez's financial and propaganda squandering in Latin 
America, it would do better to assist Venezuelan daily 
"El Universal"...that would be far more effective...and 
wouldn't give Chavez a new excuse to remain in power 
forever by arguing that he is defending Venezuela from 
the claws of `imperialism'."
