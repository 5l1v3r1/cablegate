REF: BAGHDAD 3201 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Coalition Forces are working with the 
Central Criminal Court of Iraq (CCCI) to expedite the 
trial of two Turkish nationals requested for 
extradition by Turkey on suspicion of involvement in 
the Istanbul bombings. (As noted in Reftel, the CCCI 
has informed Post that it intends to try both 
individuals prior to their extradition to Turkey.) 
 
¶2.  (SBU) One of the two extradition candidates, 
Sadettin Akdas, was tried by the CCCI on August 7, 
2005 and convicted of crimes against the internal 
security of the state. He was sentenced to twenty 
years' imprisonment, and is now available for 
extradition. He remains in a Coalition detention 
facility pending Iraqi approval of the Turkish 
extradition request. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The remaining candidate, Burhan Kus, 
attended an investigative hearing on August 15, 2005, 
at which he admitted illegal entry into Iraq for the 
purpose of conducting terrorist attacks. We expect he 
will appear before a CCCI trial panel in mid-to-late 
September; conviction appears likely. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Post has arranged a meeting of Turkish 
Ambassador Cevikoz, Major General William Brandenburg 
(MNF-I Deputy Commanding General - Detainee 
Operations) and Judge Medhat, President of the Iraqi 
Higher Juridical Council on August 23, 2005 to discuss 
next steps in the extradition of Mr. Akdas.
