(SBU) PolOff discussed reftel points with Ambassador Jose 
Joaquin Chaverri, Director General for Foreign Policy at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on August 26.  Chaverri 
confirmed that Costa Rica would be represented at the August 
28 event in Caracas by its Alternate Representative to the 
OAS, Luis Guardia.  Chaverri discounted our concern that the 
event would result in one member state's proposal being 
considered before others by saying that Costa Rica expected 
to review several other member states' proposals at the 
event.  Chaverri specifically mentioned a Mexican proposal in 
this context.  Chaverri added that Costa Rica would not agree 
to support any proposal until all had been considered.
