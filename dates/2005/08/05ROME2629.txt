 ¶1. Summary.  Italy confirms its support for the concept of a 
SEEBRIG deployment as described in reftels and will work with 
the U.S. on details of possible implementation. End Summary. 
 
¶2. On August 4, DATT delivered Reftel A talking points to LTG 
Fabrizio Castegnetti, newly appointed chief of the Italian 
Interforce Operational Command (COI).  In his previous post 
as Deputy CHOD, Castegnetti had already promoted the concept 
of an Afghanistan mission for SEEBRIG at the most recent 
DCHOD meeting during Italy's turn as SEEBRIG commander (Note: 
SEEBRIG command has now passed to Bulgaria).  In regard to a 
possible SEEBRIG deployment in Afghanistan, Castegnetti said 
he did not immediately see how Italy itself could come up 
with logistical resources because Italy is currently 
overstretched in overseas military operations.  However, 
Castegnetti said that his commitment to the concept of the 
SEEBRIG deployment remained firm, that he would study ways to 
move the project forward, and that he would work with the 
U.S. in developing ideas.  The Embassy will approach 
Castegnetti again on SEEBRIG deployment when Italy goes back 
to work after August holidays. 
 
¶3. Comment.  Castegnetti's new role as chief of COI, his 
previous involvement in SEEBRIG,  and his longstanding close 
working relationship with this Embassy, mean that he will be 
an effective partner with the U.S. in laying the groundwork 
for a SEEBRIG deployment.  End Comment.
