SUBJECT: SAN JOSE: UN HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL DEMARCHE 
 
REF: STATE 140192 
 
¶1. (SBU) Charge d'Affaires delivered the demarche to Foreign 
Minister Roberto Tovar on August 1.  Poloff also sent talking 
points by fax to Carlos Cordero, Deputy Director for 
Multilateral Affairs.  In the meeting with the Charge, 
Minister Tovar expressed his belief that the Human Rights 
Commission is broken, and is badly in need of repair. 
Minister Tovar would not comment specifically on the U.S. 
proposal, but agreed to review the talking points. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In a follow-up call on August 3, Cordero told Poloff 
that he had forwarded the talking points to Costa Rica's 
mission to the UN, and was awaiting their comments.  He did 
note, however, that the U.S. and GOCR are in general 
agreement when it comes to UN Human Rights reforms, but 
differed on small details.  Post expects the GOCR to support 
the U.S. proposal.
