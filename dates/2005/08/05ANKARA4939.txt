REF: SABO EMAIL DATED 22 AUGUST 2005 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  ON 22 August 2005 Acting DCM Timothy Betts 
received a letter, written in Arabic, claiming that 
Mujahideen here in Turkey will strike down our personnel and 
families.  The letter was discussed at Country Team today, 23 
August.  Turkish National Police are investigating.  End 
summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On Monday, 22 August 2005 in the local mail A/DCM 
Tim Betts received a letter postmarked 16 
August in Cankaya, Ankara (the area where the Embassy is 
located).  The letter was addressed to: 
 
Mr. Timothy Betts 
Embassy of USA 
Ataturk Bulvari. 110 
Kavaklidere   Ankara 
 
The address was written in English except for "Bulvari." 
Inside the envelope was one sheet which carried writing in 
Arabic.  An informal translation prepared inside the Embassy 
follows: 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In the name of God, the Beneficent, the Merciful 
 
God most high said, "They killed all the unbelievers just as 
they (the unbelievers) killed all of you, and know that God 
is with the pious." 
 
Verily, the price of the tyranny and oppression that is being 
practiced against Islam and the Muslims in Iraq and many 
parts of the world will soon be pushed higher, here in the 
land of the Caliphate, Turkey( 
 
Indeed, the fighters (mujahideen) who are tied to this land 
are observing your movements( and they will strike your 
necks (cut off your heads) soon( successive blows without 
end( We will target all of your personnel and their families 
and all of your abodes without exception ( The one who warns 
is forgiven(. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Comment by ECON Counselor who did the translation: 
It's very good Arabic, written by a native speaker or someone 
close to a native speaker; some of the constructions are a 
bit complicated.   The language is "classical," that is using 
older, religious vocabulary, which suggests that the writer 
may have had a religious education of some kind. 
 
¶5. (U) At Country Team on 23 August RSO summarized this 
incident, reminded everyone to practice good personal 
security measures, and distributed the Personal Security 
Self-Assessment Checklist.  RSO will follow-up with the 
suggestion made at CT that the recent cable distributed to 
COMs addressing personal security and the checklist be sent 
out electronically to the entire mission. 
 
¶6.  (U) The envelope and letter has been sent to the 
Intelligence Division of the Turkish National Police for 
investigation. 
 
¶7.  (U) A full EAC has tentatively been scheduled for Friday 
August 26 and the overall security posture of post will be 
reviewed. 
 
¶8.  (U) Point of contact is RSO JANET SABO AT 90-312-455-5555 
ext. 2348.
