action, Minister Burgos traveled to Washington, D.C. to 
hold talks with the Secretary of State to share what was 
received and for the corresponding investigations to be 
carried out. 
At the general archive of the Ministry of Foreign 
Relations there is only a photostatic copy of the presented 
project and a note about what was carried out in 
Washington.  A copy of the project is enclosed. 
The Ministry of Foreign Relations - Department of 
Africa, Asia and Oceania, with the purpose of completing 
the corresponding historic file, will appreciate the 
donation of a copy of the documentation processed by the 
Department of State on this matter. 
The Ministry of Foreign Relations - Department of
