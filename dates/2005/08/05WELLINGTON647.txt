Post on August 18 delivered reftel demarche to the New 
Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT).  James 
Hartley of MFAT's Legal Division reported August 24 that the 
ministry still was consulting with various government 
agencies before developing a final position on the UNESCO 
Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity 
of Cultural Expressions.  A Cabinet decision on the 
government's position is likely to be required . New Zealand 
hopes to send Crawford Falconer, its ambassador to the WTO, 
to the August 25 informal meeting to discuss the convention, 
but his schedule has not yet been confirmed.
