offices in the Mission. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Though post has no feedback to offer on the 
discussion questions at this time, we note that "Industrial 
Regional Benefits (IRBs)" (Canadian equivalent of "offsets") 
figure prominently in federal government procurement 
decisions across the board, and especially in defense 
procurement.  IRBs give the federal governing party leverage 
vis-a-vis the provincial governments and among the 
electorate.  Mission is working on a report on Canadian 
defense procurement practices.
