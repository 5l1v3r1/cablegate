Anti-Smuggling and Organized Crimes Department of National 
Police General Directorate revealed that arms smuggling, which 
had declined after 2000, has increased anew due to Coalition 
Forces' invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the vacuum of authority in 
Northern Iraq. According to the report, 2,993 persons involved 
in arms smuggling were arrested, and 2,795 pistols and 319 
long-barreled weapons were seized in the past five years. 
CUMHURIYET, YENI SAFAK, MILLI GAZETE: Labor Party Chairman Dogu 
Perincek claimed that the "Religions and Cultures Park Project" 
to be implemented in Sanliurfa aimed at the "Judaization" of the 
region. Perincek said Israel has agreed to pay $20 million to 
the project provided a synagogue was included in it. The Current 
Justice and Development Party Mayor of Sanliurfa is also 
supporting the project. Perincek added that the project would 
become the site of Jewish and Christian missionaries' 
activities. Perincek said "This project forms the cultural leg 
of the United States' Broader Middle East Initiative. The US 
wants to make the Kurdish populated-Urfa and Kurds its 
collaborators." 
ULKEDE OZGUR GUNDEM: 101 students, 62 male and 39 female,

ULKEDE OZGUR GUNDEM, EVRENSEL: PKK guerillas attacked the 
Basakci Jandarma Station in Tunceli on August 15, wounding one

Mameki Bridge, right at the entrance of Tunceli. 
ULKEDE OZGUR GUNDEM: The Van Migrant Association, VMA, formed a 
"Legal Commission" to assist individuals who would apply for 
benefits from the recently passed "Compensation of Losses 
Stemming from Anti-terror Struggle" law. VMA demanded that the 
maximum amount of indemnity determined by law be raised from 12 
billion Turkish Liras (approximately $8,300) to 50 billion 
Turkish Liras (approximately $33,500) per case. 384 persons have 
applied to VMA's Legal Commission, and VMA officials attributed 
the high number of applicants to the fact that some lawyers were 
demanding up to 25 % of the indemnities for legal services they 
would provide. A similar commission has been set up at Mardin's 
Human Rights Association, as well.
