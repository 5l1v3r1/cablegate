SUBJECT: DARFUR:  PROBLEMS WITH RWANDAN TRANSPORT 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Charge spoke with Dutch Charge the morning of 13 
August regarding the movement of a company of Rwandan 
soldiers to Darfur to provide protection to AU observers. 
According to Dutch Charge, one commercial aircraft will 
transport RDF troops and equipment in two or three sorties 
from Kigali.  As of 1020 GMT, the aircraft had not arrived in 
Kigali.  Despite previous estimates that it would require 
three days to load the aircraft once it had landed, both the 
Dutch Charge and the RDF were hopeful that the plane could 
take off for Darfur tomorrow (8/14) as planned.  As one 
senior RDF officer put it, they "will work through the night". 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  A last minute problem has arisen over the 
transport of RDF ammunition.  Apparently, the RDF was not 
aware of international rules for the transport of hazardous 
goods, such as ammunition, and did not prepare the ammunition 
properly.  The Dutch Charge said that he is working with the 
RDF to try to resolve the issue, and the AU is assisting.  At 
present, it appears the RDF will charter a local air cargo 
service, Silverback, to take the hazerdous material.  It has 
not been resolved who will pay for this second charter, but 
the RDF is hopeful that either the AU or the Dutch will foot 
the bill. 
 
¶3.  (U)  Embassy will continue to monitor and advise of any 
undue delays in the Rwandan movement. 
 
¶4.  (U)  Khartoum minimize considered.
