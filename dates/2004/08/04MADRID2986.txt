Â¶1.  On August 4, we passed reftel points and exchange of 
letters to Jesus Antonio Perez Blanco, Subdirector General 
for Airline Navigation Systems and Airports at the Ministry 
of Public Works.  We also shared points with two MFA 
contacts:  Emilio Fernandez-Castano, Director General of 
International Economic Relations and Daniel Martinez Javega 
in their legal department.  Although points were delivered, 
ministries are running on a highly-reduced staff for August 
vacation.  A response is not expected until later in the 
month.  Embassy will follow up when reactions are received.
