¶1.  In response to the Embassy's offer to include Ecuador in 
the State Department's Small Arms/Light Weapons (SALW) 
destruction program, Ecuador's service chiefs recently 
provided lists of weapons and ammunition they wish to 
destroy.  Ecuador's joint command later blessed the 
inventory.  Post believes there is sufficient overlap between 
USG priorities (MANPADS, RPGs, shoulder-fired munitions) and 
the military's request to merit Ecuador's SALW inclusion. 
 
¶2.  Translation of combined lists follows (Post also emailed 
the list August 27 to PM/WRA POC Mark Adams).
