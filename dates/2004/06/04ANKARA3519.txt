¶1. (U) We delivered Reftel non-paper to MFA Arms Control 
Department Head Bulent Meric on June 11.  On June 22, MFA 
Arms Control Officer Omur Unsay called PolMilOff with the 
following reaction: Turkey has completed preparing its draft 
implementing legislation that will now require parliamentary 
approval.  Unsay emphasized that this would take time, but 
that Turkey was well aware of the time limit, and that Turkey 
expected the legislation to be passed and implemented within 
the one year's time available. 
 
¶2. Unsay added that the MFA had informed the Turkish Embassy 
in The Hague of the status, and that the Turkish Embassy 
would inform the OPCW Secretariat and the other members of 
the Western Group.
