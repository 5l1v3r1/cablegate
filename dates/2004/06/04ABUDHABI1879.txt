SUBJECT: UAE - SHARING THE JUNE 4 REVISED DRAFT TEXT 
OF A NEW UNSCR ON IRAQ 
 
Ref: (A) State 124992, (B) State 121748 
 
Polchief discussed with Yacub Al-Hosani, the director 
of the MFA's International Organizations Department, 
the latest modifications to the revised draft UNSCR 
text on Iraq (ref A) on June 6.  Al-Hosani said that 
he had already received the draft UNSCR from the UAE's 
UN Mission in New York, and he noted that the language 
had substantially improved from the last version (ref 
B).  He said the clarifications about the 
multinational force's mandate are a critical part of 
the resolution because they go to the heart of the 
Iraq sovereignty issue.
