¶1. (SBU) Econchief delivered reftel demarche encouraging 
UAE - Iraqi contacts on sovereign debt issues to the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance and 
the Central Bank.  He discussed it with Ministry of Finance 
Assistant Undersecretary for Revenue and Budget Khalid Al- 
Bustani and Central Bank Executive Director for Banking 
Supervision Saeed Al-Hamiz on June 6, 2004 and stressed the 
USG's support for the Iraqi request for meetings.  Both 
officials said that they had not received any communication 
from the Iraqi government requesting bilateral meetings. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Al-Bustani told Econchief that the IIG should 
contact the UAEG directly to schedule a meeting.  He 
suggested that the best approach would be for the Iraqis to 
communicate with the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 
writing.  The MFA could then ensure that the message was 
distributed to all appropriate parties in the UAEG and 
appropriately coordinated.
