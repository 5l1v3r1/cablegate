¶1. On December 19, Bahrain's Ministry of Commerce officially 
registered The American Chamber of Commerce in Bahrain as a 
non-profit company.  That evening, the Minister announced the 
registration at an AMCHAM membership dinner sponsored by 
Microsoft and American Express.  Approximately 60 high-level 
U.S. business representatives along with government officials 
and journalists heard the Commerce Minister and Charge' note 
that the creation of an AMCHAM in Bahrain is a vital step for 
promoting bilateral trade and making the FTA a success.  The 
AMCHAM formation committee reported an enthusiastic response 
to the membership drive.  The committee hopes to hold a 
general assembly and elect a board of directors by mid-July, 
before Bahrainis depart the country to escape the summer heat. 
 
¶2.  COMMENT:  The commercial registration of a fully 
independent, fully legal AMCHAM in Bahrain is an important 
component of our drive to make the FTA a success.  We hope 
U.S. corporate headquarters' will support membership in this 
organization and push for its accreditation by the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce.  END COMMENT.
