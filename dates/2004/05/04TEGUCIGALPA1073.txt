Â¶1. Editorial in Tegucigalpa-based moderate daily "El 
Heraldo" on 5/7 entitled "Bush in trouble."  "Things are 
turning out for the worse for President Bush, more than a 
year after the Iraqi invasion and after having declared the 
end of the military actions.  However, the Iraqis are still 
resisting, causing the death of thousands of American 
soldiers." 
 
"He's not only swamped with an eroding war, getting more and 
more enemies as time goes by.  He has even been forced to 
apologize for the documented human rights abuses his troops 
have caused to several Iraqis who are prisoners in their own 
country, among an avalanche of criticism and condemnation in 
the whole world." 
 
"Things aren't going well for the man who decided to skip 
the U.N. regulations to invade another fellow U.N. member, 
despite the fact he hasn't been able to properly justify his 
actions and the growing opposition around the world." 
 
"In fact, it's evident the main reasons to attack Iraq under 
the campaign to fight terrorism were false.  Perhaps Ted 
Kennedy is right when he said that Iraq is Bush's Vietnam."
