REF: SECSTATE 98283 
 
PolOff discussed reftel points with Silvia Corado, Director 
for Multilateral Affairs at the Foreign Ministry on May 4. 
Corado agreed that a large international presence is required 
to guarantee the integrity of the appeals process for 
revalidating the recall referendum.  However, the Guatemalan 
government's austerity program rules out sending a 
delegation.  Corado said members of the Embassy in Caracas 
would be seconded to the OAS Observer Mission, but had no 
additional details to share.
