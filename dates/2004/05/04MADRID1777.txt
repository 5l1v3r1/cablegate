¶1. We delivered reftel points to Francisco Arana Landa, 
Subdirector General for Nuclear Energy in the Ministry of 
Industry, Tourism and Trade.  Echoing the response he gave 
during our first approach on this issue (ref b), Arana said 
May 17 that no decisions have been made due to the change of 
government and the fact that newly-appointed officials are 
not yet settled in to their positions.  He promised to 
contact us once a decision had been made.
