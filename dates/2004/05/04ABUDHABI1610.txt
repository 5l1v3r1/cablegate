GOVERNING COUNCIL CHAIRMAN 
 
 
¶1. (U) The UAE Government issued a strong public 
condemnation on May 18 of the assassination of 
Izzadine Saleem, Chairman of the Iraqi Governing 
Council.  The official news agency quoted a Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs source as saying that the UAE 
"strongly condemns the heinous assassination" of 
Saleem, along with several other Iraqi citizens, 
victims of a "vicious criminal act."   The source 
called on Iraqis to unite against those "who are bent 
on destruction, disunity and blood-letting.  By 
committing such acts, the perpetuators aim to 
exacerbate the situation, wreak havoc, create anarchy 
and thereby thwart the process of power transfer to 
the Iraqi people.  This vicious calculation is clearly 
intended to impede the restoration of security and 
stability to Iraq."  This was the strongest public 
condemnation we have seen the UAEG use in reference to 
a terrorist attack in Iraq in the past year. 
 
¶2. (U) Baghdad minimize considered.
