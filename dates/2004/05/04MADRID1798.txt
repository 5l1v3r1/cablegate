Â¶1.  Per reftel Pol-miloff met May 10 with Guillermo 
Kirkpatrick, MFA's Director General for International Arms 
Control Affairs to revisit this issue.  Kirkpatrick said 
given the new government is still getting into place, it is 
highly unlikely the GOS will make a decision on whether to 
become a Global Partnership Donor prior to the Sea Island 
Summit in June, and maybe not by then.  The senior official 
responsible for issue, Rafael Dezcallar, Director General for 
Political Affairs, has taken over his position just recently 
and is getting up to speed on the issue.  If the GOS does 
make a decision before the Sea Island Summit, Kirkpatrick 
promised to let us know.  Meanwhile, we will continue to look 
for opportunities to press the issue with the GOS.
