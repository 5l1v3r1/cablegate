REF: STATE 089241 
 
As instructed by reftel, post briefed the GOC on U.S. plans 
for our mission to Iraq, and asked for their plans for 
representation.  The MFA's Director for Asia, Africa, and 
Oceania, Ambassador Guillermo Orjuela, advised post that GOC 
has no plans for representation.  He noted that the MFA has 
closed several embassies, including their mission to Iran in 
2002, as part of austerity measures introduced by the Uribe 
Administration.  He said that the GOC did not have relations 
with Iraq prior to the war.  Drawing on memory, he added that 
in the late 1970s the GOC conducted relations with Iraq via 
their mission in Vienna.  We will advise of any changes in 
the GOC position.
