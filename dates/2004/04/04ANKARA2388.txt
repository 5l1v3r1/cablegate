¶1. In an April 13 meeting with Econoff, Okay Kilic and 
Nihat Asan, Department Heads at the Turkish Maritime 
Undersecretariat, said that Turkish ships should be in 
compliance with the International Maritime 
Organization's (IMO) International Ship and Port 
Facility Security Code (ISPS) by July 1, but that some 
ports may not meet the deadline.  IMO members will have 
the right to turn away ships that have visited ports 
which do not meet ISPS standards after July 1. 
 
 
¶2. Kilic said that vessels were being evaluated by 10 
designated "recognized security organizations" (RSOs). 
About 200 of 670 Turkish ships have completed a security 
plan and the remainder should comply by July 1. 
However, the process for Turkish ports is moving more 
slowly.  In part, this is due to the fact that only five 
RSOs had been designated, although Kilic told us that 
further RSOs would be selected.  Kilic stated that a 
number of Turkey's privately-run port facilities were 
apparently resisting this security requirement, 
primarily due to the cost of completing an assessment. 
Asan estimated that about 60 percent of Turkey's 124 
ports should be in compliance with ISPS by July 1, 
including the main ports servicing trade with the United 
States (Izmir, Istanbul, Mersin).  However, the others 
are likely to miss the deadline. 
 
 
¶3. Kilic and Asan asked whether there is any possibility 
of extending the July 1 deadline.  Econoff responded 
that the ISPS requirement set a firm deadline, but that 
he would report the Maritime Undersecretariat's concerns 
on this.  Kilic and Asan also expressed interest in 
visiting a U.S. port to learn about American 
implementation of the ISPS.  Embassy will relay this 
request to the DHS/Coast Guard points of contact listed 
reftel.
