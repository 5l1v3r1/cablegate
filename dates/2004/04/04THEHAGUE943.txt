 (SBU) PolOff conveyed reftel points to Karen Burbach of the 
Dutch MFA Human Rights Office on April 14.  Burbach cited the 
draft chairman's statement on Sudan proposed by the Africa 
group on April 13, and called it too weak for the Netherlands 
to accept.  She noted that EU CHR members would be meeting 
later on April 14 and would seek to insert certain benchmarks 
into the Africa group text including:  establishment of a 
special rapporteur, condemnation of human rights violations 
and the need for cooperation with the UN.  Burbach said that, 
at this stage, the GONL supported trying to amend the draft 
chairman's statement because it thought it unlikely that a 
Sudan resolution would pass.
