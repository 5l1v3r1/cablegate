SUBJECT: MDC MP MASAITI ARREST 
 
REF: A. HARARE 682 
     ¶B. HARARE 553 
 
¶1. (U) MDC Member of Parliament for Mutasa Evelyn Masaiti was 
arrested in Mabvuku on April 17 on her way back from her 
constituency for allegedly looting a shop owned by acting 
Harare Mayor Sekesayi Makwavarara.  Masaiti told poloff on 
April 22 that she was driving from her constituency in 
Manicaland back to Harare to attend the April 19 Independence 
Day celebration when she was stopped by riot police in 
Mabvuku.  The police quizzed her about a soccer match the MDC 
had organized in Mabvuku and, despite her protestations 
arrested her.  While she was in custody, Makwavarara's shop 
in Mabvukhu was looted.  Masaiti said she, her driver, and 
another companion were beaten with batons by the riot police 
while they were in police custody.  The accused were 
transfered to Harare Central Prison on April 19. 
 
¶2. (U) Masaiti understood she was to be charged in the 
looting and was scheduled to appear in court on April 20, but 
the date was changed to April 21 after the State realized 
Masaiti was in police custody during the looting.  Masaiti 
was subsequently charged with organizing a football match for 
MDC supporters as a way of inciting the youth to protest 
against the death of an MDC supporter in last month's Zengeza 
by-election.  She was released on Z$100,000 bail April 21 and 
is scheduled to appear in court on April 29. 
 
¶3. Comment: (U) In its comprehensive campaign to steamroll 
the weakened opposition, ZANU-PF appears to be stepping up 
its harassment of MDC MPs in the run-up to the 2005 
Parliamentary elections.  The MDC parliamentary membership 
generally has been a heavily persecuted lot--more than half 
have been arrested during their tenure, and most have been 
physically assaulted and had their property destroyed.  In an 
apparent quid pro quo for MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai's 
attendance of President Mugabe's opening of Parliament in 
July 2003, attacks on opposition MPs ceased during the second 
half of last hear.  However, during the last four months, 
three MPs--Masaiti, Roy Bennet (Ref A), Ben Tumbare-Mutasa 
(Ref B)--have been arrested or harassed.  End Comment.
