BRIEFING 
Cyprus:  "Cumhuriyet" reports that the US Administration is 
exerting efforts to ensure that the UN Security Council 
approves a resolution on Cyprus implementation guarantees in 
advance of Saturday's referenda.  "Hurriyet" reports that 
AKEL leader Christofias urged Powell and Annan to secure 
approval of the resolution.  "Cumhuriyet" notes that `TRNC 
President' Denktas continues to campaign against the Annan 
plan.  `I know for sure that those who say yes today will be 
crying in three months time,' Denktas said yesterday. 
"Yeni Safak" reports that some political parties and other 
groups from Turkey arrived on the island to campaign for the 
refusal of the UN plan.  Former PM Ecevit arrived in Cyprus 
yesterday and referred to Greek Cypriots as `expansionist 
and racist.'  MHP leader Devlet Bahceil is also in Cyprus to 
oppose the plan. "Zaman" notes a current poll that indicates 
a 60 percent yes vote is likely in the `TRNC.' 
 
 
NSC Meeting on Monday:  Turkey's National Security Council 
will hold an extraordinary session on Monday to discuss 
developments in Cyprus following this weekend's referenda. 
 
 
Seized Ammunition:  All papers report that Italian police at 
the port of Gioia Tauro seized around 8,000 Kalashnikovs and 
military uniforms from a Turkish ship on Tuesday.  The 
weapons were reportedly loaded in Romania, and were 
scheduled for onward transport to New York.  The ship's 
owner acknowledged that the ship had been carrying weapons, 
but claimed that he thought the weapons were `antiques.' 
Italian authorities are continuing to investigate the 
incident. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
EDITORIAL OPINION: 
 
 
"Division the only solution left for Cyprus" 
Mehmet Ali Birand commented in the mass appeal "Posta" 
(4/21):  "The mistaken policies pursued by Denktas and 
Ankara in the past have enabled the Greek Cypriots to 
deceive the international community for long decades in a 
way that portrays the Greeks as the only side favoring a 
peaceful settlement in Cyprus. .  The EU's membership offer 
to the Greek Cypriots, US support for the Annan Plan, and 
the sidelining of Denktas have revealed the true intentions 
of the Greek Cypriots.  The Southern Cypriots will be 
digging their own grave if they vote against the Annan Plan 
on April 24.  Saying `no' in the referendum will mean 
acknowledging that division is the only formula to be 
applied in Cyprus.  It is up to the Greek Cypriots to decide 
whether to accept the Annan Plan or divide the island." 
 
 
 "The Middle East provoked" 
Mim Kemal Oke opined in the conservative/mass appeal "DB- 
Tercuman" (4/21):  "Israel is pursuing an extermination 
strategy against Hamas.  However, the real intention is to 
provoke Hamas into fanatical actions that will expose to the 
international community the viciousness of Palestinians and 
will also give Israel a pretext to retaliate. .  Hamas has 
remained silent thus far. .  The EU has not approved the 
occupation of Iraq by the US.  President Bush would like to 
end the foreign policy isolation the US has been facing 
after the war with Iraq. .  The upcoming presidential 
election in the US is a determining factor as well.  Bush, 
who is being challenged seriously by Kerry, feels obliged to 
play for the Jewish vote.""EDELMAN
