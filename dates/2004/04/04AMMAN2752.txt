TO NEEDS IN FALLUJAH 
 
¶1.  A quick survey of NGO representatives in Amman revealed 
that most relief agencies had pulled their international 
staff from Iraq in early April in anticipation of violence 
surrounding the April 9 anniversary of the fall of Baghdad 
and the Arba'aeen Shi'a pilgrimage.  As IRD Iraq 
Representative Richard Harmon explained to refcoord on April 
8, the convergence of the anniversary with the Shi'a 
pilgrimage seemed to create inviting opportunities for 
terrorists and hence greater security risks for humanitarian 
workers.  Because of these risks, Harmon gave his 
international staff an extended Easter holiday and asked them 
not to return to work until mid-April.  NGO Coordinating 
Committee for Iraq (NCCI) Representative Elodie 
Cantier-Aristide confirmed on April 12 that most NGOs had 
instituted similar policies and pulled their international 
staff out of Iraq well before the current violence and 
kidnappings began.  Following the kidnapping of international 
relief workers and missionaries, UNAMI NGO Coordinator Maura 
Lynch said that most NGO security officers have recommended 
that all international staff depart Iraq immediately. 
 
¶2.  In spite of the kidnapping threats, some NGOs continue to 
provide emergency relief, particularly in the Fallujah area. 
Cantier-Aristide confirmed that two NGO relief convoys 
entered Fallujah April 10-11, organized by Islamic Relief, 
Premiere Urgence and UPT.  The convoys delivered medical 
supplies and some non-food items donated by UNHCR.  ICRC and 
the GOJ also sent separate medical convoys to Fallujah. 
According to Lynch, Iraqi mosques are providing ad hoc 
assistance to civilians fleeing Fallujah, most of whom are 
headed to family and friends in the Baghdad area.  IOM is 
preparing to provide further assistance to Iraqis displaced 
by the current round of fighting but Lynch cautioned that UN 
security restrictions will affect IOM's ability to respond.
