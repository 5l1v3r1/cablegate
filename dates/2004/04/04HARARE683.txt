1.(SBU) Summary:  On 21 APR 2004, Amb. Sullivan 
discussed land reform and conservancies with GOZ Minister 
of Environment and Tourism Francis Nhema. Minister Nhema 
suggested private agreements between current owners and 
indigenous groups could be allowed as long as indigenous 
peoples benefited from, and were included as partners in, 
the operation of the conservancies. End Summary. 
 
 
2.(SBU) Ambassador Sullivan raised the potential 
seizure of land from Hammond Ranch of the Save 
Conservancy and Twin Springs in the Kwekwe district, both 
owned by American citizens. 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Nhema was aware of negotiations between 
Save Conservancy and a local indigenous company, 
Traditions, to run the conservancy as a partnership 
(ref). He mentioned that he was waiting for Save 
Conservancy to present a final proposal. 
 
4.(SBU) Nhema was not familiar with the Twin Springs 
property but stated that at 7000 plus hectares he saw no 
problem with the owners coming to an agreement with local 
groups along the lines of Save Conservancy's ongoing 
negotiations. Nhema said he objected to very small 
conservancies with only 1000 hectares. 
 
5.(SBU) Nhema emphasized the need for 1) indigenous 
peoples to benefit from the conservancies, 2) existing 
owners to partner with local groups to run the 
conservancies, and 3) a permanent solution which locks in 
conservation as the sole use for the land. 
 
d. 
 
6.(SBU) Comment: Although local sources suggest Nhema 
regularly exploits his official position for commercial 
gain, he appeared interested in preserving conservancies 
and wildlife. He stated that some of the conservancies 
taken over were not properly registered with the GOZ. 
Both American-owned properties in question are properly 
registered and possess Zimbabwe Investment Center 
certificates. 
 
7.(SBU) Biographic Note: Nhema received an MBA from 
the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and 
worked at the Zimbabwean Embassy in Washington DC as well 
as the Zimbabwean UN Mission in New York. He would like 
to visit Chicago because of various movie images he has 
seen- although he mentioned no current plans for travel.
