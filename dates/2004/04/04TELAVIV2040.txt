THIS IS A JOINT MESSAGE FROM EMBASSY TEL AVIV AND CONGEN 
JERUSALEM. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary: One Palestinian was killed April 2 in a 
heavy exchange of fire that erupted between IDF soldiers and 
Palestinian militants during an IDF incursion into the 
al-Salaam area of the Rafah refugee camp.  On April 1, UNRWA 
said in a press release that it was suspending delivery into 
Gaza of food aid for Palestinian refugees due to the 
unresolved issue of removing empty shipping containers from 
Gaza (see reftel and Tel Aviv septel).  UNRWA said that 
failure to remove the empty shipping containers while still 
bringing in full ones would result in a bottleneck and 
prohibitive demurrage costs.  In the West Bank, Israeli 
police shot six Palestinians with rubber bullets and injured 
about 30 other Palestinians with tear gas in response to 
stone-throwing by some worshippers at the Haram al Sharif 
complex April 2.  The police made 20 arrests.  Settlers in 
Hebron beat up a Palestinian boy April 1, and threw stones at 
an Arab bus in the northern West Bank, lightly injuring two 
babies, according to press reports.  End Summary.

refugee camp at approximately 0020 hours April 2, reportedly 
to search for tunnels used for the smuggling.  Palestinian 
militants fired on the troops and one Palestinian man was 
shot and killed in the ensuing heavy crossfire.  The 
operation was ongoing as of 1400 hours April 2. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) BORDER CROSSINGS/CHECKPOINTS: 
 
-- Route Four (Salahadeen Road), the main north-south traffic 
artery, was open for Palestinians. 
 
-- Erez Crossing was closed to Palestinians laborers April 2, 
but open for merchants over 28 years of age.  The number of 
merchants crossing April 2 was unavailable.  The IDF also 
allowed diplomats in vehicles and internationals on foot to 
cross.  UN agencies, however, refuse to authorize their 
non-diplomatic staff to cross on foot; staff must wait to 
cross until they can join someone crossing in a diplomatic 
vehicle.  The Erez Industrial Zone was closed April 2 due to 
a security alert, according to Israeli media. 
 
-- Sufa Crossing was closed for Palestinian laborers April 2, 
but open for the import into Gaza of aggregates used in 
construction. 
 
-- Karni Terminal was partially open for the import and 
export of goods into the Gaza Strip.  Unpacked goods may 
enter, but no Palestinian shipping containers may enter or 
exit.  On April 1, UNRWA said in a press release that it was 
suspending delivery into Gaza of food aid for Palestinian 
refugees due to the unresolved issue of removing empty 
shipping containers from Gaza (see reftel and Tel Aviv 
septel).  UNRWA said that failure to remove the empty 
shipping containers while still bringing in full containers 
would result in a bottleneck and prohibitive costs. 
 
-- Rafah Terminal was open for Palestinian travelers. 
 
-- Information on the status of Tel al-Sultan and Toufah 
checkpoints April 2 was unavailable.
