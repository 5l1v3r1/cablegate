SUBJECT: AFGHANISTAN: TURKEY STILL CONSIDERING PRT FOR 
TAKHAR 
 
REF: ANKARA 3618 
 
¶1. Turkish press reported July 15-16 that Turkey had decided 
to send a 200-man PRT to Takhar, Afghanistan.  We contacted 
the Turkish MFA July 16 seeking confirmation/clarification. 
MFA informed us that while no decision has yet been taken, 
Turkey is indeed reconsidering its formerly withdrawn 
proposal (see reftel) to send a PRT to Takhar and expected to 
reach a final decision in the next two weeks.  MFA South Asia 
Department will contact us when a decision is reached. 
 
¶2. Kabul minimize considered.
