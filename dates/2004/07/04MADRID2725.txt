The Spanish Council of Ministers approved the donation of EUR 
14.4 million (USD 17.4 million) on July 16 to finance the 
production of the new Iraqi dinar.  This allocation of funds 
will fulfill Spain's pledge of USD 18 million for production 
of Iraqi dinars during 2004-2005, promised at the Madrid 
Donor's Conference.  This disbursement is a further sign of 
Spain's intention to fulfill its USD 300 million commitment 
to Iraq reconstruction (reftel).
