Post delivered on July 6 reftel points on Iraqi assets to 
Luiza Lopes da Silva, Acting Director of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs (MRE) Office of International Illicit 
Activities, and to Bernardo Mota of COAF, Brazil's financial 
intelligence unit.  Mota undertook to search COAF's own 
databases as well as to share the list with the Central Bank 
and intelligence agency (ABIN), for them to check for 
financial assets in the names of the persons and entities on 
the USG list.  Lopes da Silva said the MRE would coordinate 
with its mission in New York a response to the USG request to 
support the listing of these persons and entities by the UN 
1518 Sanctions Committee.
