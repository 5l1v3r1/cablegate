(SBU) Drawing on reftel, DCM discussed USG planning for the 
Fourth Summit of the Americas with Foreign Minister-designate 
Samuel Lewis Navarro, whose initial response was to note that 
the U.S. themes looked very much like his own party's 
campaign platform.  Indeed, he reiterated what 
President-elect Torrijos has told us in recent meetings -- 
that the incoming PRD government will give priority to 
economic growth by encouraging greater domestic and foreign 
investment.  Lewis said that their goal was "to transform 
employees into entrepreneurs," which requires reducing the 
time that it takes Panamanians (and foreigners) to open up a 
business.  He also stressed that another PRD priority was to 
improve education, which was closely tied to other themes 
like economic growth and democratic governance.  In sum, 
Lewis said the PRD government that takes power on September 1 
will work closely with the United States on these themes, 
lending whatever support is necessary during the run-up to 
the November 2005 Summit in Argentina.
