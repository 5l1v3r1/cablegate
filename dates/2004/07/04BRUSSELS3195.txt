¶1.  In a meeting of the General Affairs and External 
Relations Council (GAERC) 
on July 26, EU FMs threatened sanctions if Sudan does not 
soon comply with 
international expectations on Darfur.  The GAERC Conclusions 
(available at 
http://ue.eu.int/) offer a very critical assessment of 
progress on the ground, 
and call for a UNSCR "with a view to further actions, 
including imposing 
sanctions" if the GOS does not immediately fulfill its 
commitments.  Although 
not imposing sanctions immediately, Dutch FM Bernard Bot, 
representing the EU 
Presidency, highlighted that "the EU will follow events very 
closely and, in 
light of further developments, will take action."  EU Member 
States agreed to 
continue an "active dialogue" with the Sudanese government 
and militia groups, 
Bot said.  He also referred to "active policy negotiations" 
with the UN, AU, 
and US on the issue.  He said that FMs had agreed to follow 
the path of the 
UN's agreement with Khartoum, which allows Sudan 90 days to 
improve the 
situation. 
 
¶2.  Though Bot emphasized the EU's demand for better 
containment of the rebels, 
he gave recognition to some of the recent measures the 
Sudanese government has 
taken to improve the situation -- e.g. the deployment of a 
police force with 
four thousand officers, increased access for nearly 120 
monitors, and the 
arrest of rebel leaders.  To determine if sanctions need to 
be applied, the EU 
will rely heavily on the reports of the monitors, as well as 
on the report of 
SYG Annan's special representative.  If necessary, the 
ministers will meet 
again to determine the nature of the sanctions, "in light of 
the situation in 
the field."  Bot also announced an additional 12 million 
Euros for the AU 
observer mission in Sudan, bringing the total EU contribution 
for humanitarian 
relief efforts in Sudan to 213 million Euros. 
 
¶3.  European Commission DG AIDCO officials assured USEU 
Development Counselor 
 that in view of the urgency, funds will be disbursed to the 
African Union's 
bank account by the end of this week.
