SUBJECT: GOT REQUESTS EXPEDITED PROCESSING OF US EXPORT 
LICENSE FOR MILITARY CHEMICALS 
 
 
¶1.  This is an action request -- see para 4. 
 
¶2.  MFA Acting Deputy Director General for Disarmament Bulent 
Meric convoked polmilcouns on July 19 under instructions 
"originating with military authorities."  Meric requested the 
USG expedite the processing of an export license application 
by Mil-Spec Industries for two kilograms each of three 
chemicals: cyanogen chloride (CNCl), phosgene gas (COCl2) and 
hydrocyanic acid (HCN).  These chemicals are being purchased 
by Mechanical & Chemical Industries Corporation (MKEK) to use 
in the production of gas masks for the Turkish armed forces. 
 
¶3.  Meric said that the USG rejected the original end user 
certificate as containing insufficient information.  Upon 
examination, Meric said he agreed that this was a reasonable 
finding.  The certificate was reissued by MKEK on April 6, 
2004, however, with complete information (text at para 5). 
Still, approval of the export has not been forthcoming; 
Turkish military authorities suspect the application may have 
been denied.  Polmilcouns told Meric that one should not 
assume an application had been denied unless Mil-Spec had 
been so informed.  Rather, the application may be waiting for 
US authorities to deal first with higher priorities.  Meric 
asked that the Embassy intercede to expedite the processing. 
The Turkish military is in desperate need of gas masks, he 
stated.  Meric was not certain of whether Mil-Spec has 
requested expedited handling of the license application but 
said he would inquire.  He also did not have a case number. 
 
¶4.  Action request:  Embassy requests the appropriate 
agencies expedite the processing of this Mil-Spec Industries 
export license application to the extent possible. 
 
¶5.  Begin text of April 6, 2004 end user certificate.
