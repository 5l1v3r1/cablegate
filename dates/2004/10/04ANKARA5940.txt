¶1. Turkish response on Commission for Human Rights WEOG 
rotation is contained in letter from FonMin Gul to Secretary 
Powell (para 2; original being pouched to Department). 
Turkey asks for U.S. support for increase in number of years 
allocated to Turkey. 
 
¶2. Text of Turkish response: 
 
Dear Mr. Secretary of State, 
 
Thank you very much for your Letter of 29 September 2004 
(Reftel A).  Turkey, as a country which is fully committed to 
achieving the highest standards in democracy, the rule of law 
and the promotion and protection of human rights is very much 
interested in serving actively in the United Nations 
Commission on Human Rights (CHR).   Within this framework, 
Turkey gives utmost importance to improving the work of the 
Commission and looks favorably at a rotation scheme for 
membership of WEOG countries. 
 
With this understanding, Turkey is ready to accept a rotation 
plan for the CHR within the WEOG.  We believe that objective 
criteria such as size, population, GDP, and contributions to 
the UN should be used in determining as to  how many a years 
a country will serve in the CHR.  However, the Dutch-Canadian 
proposal, which has been recently conveyed to us, does not 
seem to be fair with regard to the distribution of years for 
membership for Turkey.  During the 21-year period, the 
Dutch-Canadian proposal envisages only 6 years for Turkey 
while granting more to other countries such as Italy (14), 
Spain (11), Austria (8) and Portugal (7).  We believe that as 
a country which has achieved sweeping reforms that have been 
highly regarded by the international community, Turkey is 
better placed today to play a much more active role within 
the CHR.  With these considerations we request that Turkey be 
a member of the CHR for at least 8 years during this period. 
 
While desiring a successful conclusion of the long-standing 
efforts in bringing a rotation scheme for membership of WEOG, 
I look forward to your support for a longer term for Turkey's 
participation in the CHR than the one proposed in the 
Dutch-Canadian conceptual framework.  Sincerely, Abdullah Gul.
