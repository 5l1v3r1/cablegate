REF: SECSTATE 214134 
 
 ¶1.  Econoff delivered ref demarche to the Deputy Director 
General of the Taiwan Intellectual Property Office (TIPO), 
Jack Lu.  Lu and his staff had just returned from training in 
Washington with USPTO and had already been extensively 
briefed on the STOP! initiative.  Lu expressed Taiwan's 
willingness to fully participate in any US initiatives to 
prevent intellectual property piracy and touted Taiwan's 
recent gains in protecting IP, including the passage of 
amendments to the copyright law and the November 1 
"legalization" of the ad hoc intellectual property special 
task force.  He was concerned, however, that the provision in 
the initiative that called for publishing the names of 
companies and individuals involved in piracy in USTR's 
Special 301 report might violate privacy rights. 
 
¶2.  While in Washington, Lu, accompanied by Section Chiefs 
Margaret Chen and Bennet Chen, met with USTR and trade 
associations concerned with IPR to lobby for Taiwan's removal 
from the Special 301 list.  Lu said his meetings with the 
International Intellectual Property Association (IIPA) and 
USTR had been "very positive and very productive", and while 
no one had been willing to commit to completely removing 
Taiwan from the Special 301 list, he was optimistic that 
Taiwan's recent measures to improve the local IPR environment 
would be recognized and rewarded.
