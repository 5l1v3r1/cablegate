¶1. (U) This cable contains an action request in para 3. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On October 7, Ahmet Bigali, Director of 
Aviation Affairs at the Turkish Foreign Affairs 
Ministry, called Econoff to raise TSA security 
requirements on direct flights to the U.S. departing 
from Istanbul Ataturk Airport (ref A).  Bigali urged 
the USG to reconsider the Emergency Amendment, asking 
whether revision or cancellation of these measures is 
under consideration.  He added that the Turkish 
Minister of Finance had raised the issue in 
correspondence with MFA.  Bigali contended that the 
extensive screening requirements are a hardship for 
passengers and have led to a loss of U.S.-bound transit 
customers for Turkish Airlines. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Action Request:  To our knowledge, Turkish 
authorities have shown full cooperation with U.S. 
counterparts on this matter.  In the interest of 
maintaining that cooperation, Embassy requests a status 
update/guidance on ref A measures imposed in June, 
specifically whether there are plans to modify the 
requirements, and if so, when.  We also note that TSA's 
loan of explosive trace detection equipment in use at 
Istanbul Airport is about to expire and request 
information on whether the loan will be extended 
soonest.
