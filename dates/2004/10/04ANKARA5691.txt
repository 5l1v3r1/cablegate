SUBJECT:  DELIVERY OF CSI DEMARCHE 
 
Ref: State 198802 
 
Embassy delivered reftel demarche proposing Turkey's 
inclusion in the Container Security Initiative (CSI) via 
diplomatic note, and faxed copies to other interested 
Turkish agencies.  In a followup meeting on September 29 
with Acting Customs Undersecretary Riza Tuna Turagay, 
Econ Counselor reiterated demarche points.  Turagay told 
us he was inclined to support Turkish participation in 
CSI, which he believes will enhance Turkey's 
competitiveness in trade and transport.  However, he 
said that Customs has not completed internal 
consultations on the feasibility and desirability of 
introducing CSI to the Port of Izmir, and it will also 
have to seek the views of other agencies.  In a separate 
conversation on October 4, Orkun Ersoy, of the MFA 
Maritime Department, told Econoff that MFA was favorably 
inclined to CSI, but that GOT agencies had not taken a 
final decision on whether to proceed.  Post will provide 
updates on CSI as we receive further information from 
the GOT.
