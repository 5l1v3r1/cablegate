¶2.  As reported in Ref A, Embassy Kuwait received a letter 
from Major General Gary D. Speer, Deputy Commanding General 
of the Coalition Forces Land Component Command (CFLCC), 
requesting post's assistance in resolving the cases of three 
Egyptian drivers presumed to have been killed while driving 
in Iraq (text repeated in para 4).  CFLCC is asking for 
Government of Egypt (GOE) help in providing death

approach the Egyptian Embassy regarding the death of their 
nationals in Iraq, and convey CFLCC's request for official

Dear Mr. Tueller: 
 
Thank you for the Country Team's continued support of the 
Coalition Forces Land Component Command.  Embassy involvement 
in the foreign national driver crisis has been critical in 
moving this issue forward.  As a related matter, request your 
assistance in the cases of three Egyptian drivers who were 
killed in action while driving in Iraq for our host nation 
contractors. 
 
Missing since April 11, 2004, Egyptian truck drivers, Mr. 
Ibrahim Moussa, PP Number 792387, and Galal El Sayet Osman, 
PP Number 488960, worked under United States Army Contract 
Number W912D1-04-D-0001 for Ahamadah General Trading and 
Contracting Company.  Also, Habshy Elsayed, PP Number 
1438858, worked under United States Army Contract Number 
W912D1-04-D-004 for IAP, Incorporated and has been missing 
since April 26, 2004. 
 
These men have been missing since the convoys they were 
traveling in came under hostile fire from anti-coalition 
forces.  Although their bodies were not recovered, the nature 
of the attack and the extent of the damage to these 
individuals and their vehicles were such that they are 
presumed to be dead.  Our deepest sympathy and sorrow is 
respectfully given to their families. 
 
These drivers' employment contracts provided for a death 
gratuity in the amount of 10,000 Kuwaiti Dinar per person. 
Request assistance with the Egyptian Embassy in obtaining 
Government of Egypt death declarations (death certificates) 
for these men, so the death gratuities can be provided to 
their next of kin. 
 
Respectfully, 
Gary D. Speer 
Major General, US Army 
Deputy Commanding General
