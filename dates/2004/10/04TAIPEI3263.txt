SUBJECT:  RUNWAY ACCIDENT CLOSES TAIPEI'S SUNGSHAN AIRPORT 
 
 
A runway accident forced the closure of Taipei's Sungshan 
Airport last night.  A TransAsia Airlines Airbus A320 
slipped off the runway at 8:04 pm on October 18 after a 
flight from Hualien, Taiwan.  The aircraft was damaged but 
all 100 passengers and 6 crewmembers were unharmed.  It took 
some time for airport crews to clear the damaged plane, so 
the airport, which has only one runway, was closed to all 
flights until 10:30 am the following morning.  In all, the 
accident caused the cancellation of 30 flights.  Taiwan's 
Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) blamed a wet runway 
for the accident.  However, Taiwan's Aviation Safety 
Council, an agency independent of the CAA, will conduct an 
investigation to determine whether equipment failure or 
human error contributed to the accident.
