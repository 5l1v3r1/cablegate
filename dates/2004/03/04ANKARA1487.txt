(SBU) Econoff delivered reftel points urging that the 
UNCTAD XI Conference not be used to derail progress in 
the WTO negotiations to Asim Arar, MFA Department Head 
for Multilateral Economic Affairs, and to Husnu 
Dilemre, Deputy Director General for Agreements at the 
Foreign Trade Undersecretariat.  Arar and Dilemre told 
us that they would have to consult interagency on our 
points and were unable to provide an official response 
at this time.  However, Arar offered the personal 
opinion that the USG had a valid argument that trade 
talks should be handled in the WTO context, and not in 
UNCTAD.  Arar stated that the GOT's UNCTAD delegation 
would probably be led by Amb. Oktay Ozuye, MFA Director 
General for Economic Affairs, and that the delegation 
would include Foreign Trade and Geneva Mission 
representatives.
