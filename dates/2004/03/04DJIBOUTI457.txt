post translation of an article published in the Wednesday, 
March 24th, 2004 edition of La Nation, the official 
government mouthpiece, excerpting the Government of 
Djibouti's official statement condemning the assassination 
of Sheikh Yassin  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) BEGIN TEXT: President Ismail Omar Guelleh's 
message to Yasser Arafat firmly condemned the assassination 
of Sheikh Yassin, which he considered a demonstration of 
force aimed at discouraging all will for peace and 
constituting a serious threat to the peace process in the 
Middle East."  Guelleh strongly expressed his dismay and 
profound regrets following this barbaric and criminal act. 
In a manner, Guelleh paid homage to the militantism of 
Sheikh Yassin, characterizing him as an "eminent personality, 
who dedicated his life to fighting the occupation of his 
country and the colonization of his people."  Guelleh's 
comments reaffirmed the "complete solidarity of the people 
and government of Djibouti, as well as their indestructible 
support for the legitimate fight and aspirations of 
independence and sovereignty of the Palestinian people." 
The message reiterated "an appeal in favor of a force of 
international intervention in the occupied territories in 
order to protect the Palestinian people from being victims 
of extermination and expropriation.  END TEXT.
