We received a preliminary response to reftel points from 
Sylvia Iranzo, Deputy Subdirector General for Foreign 
Investment in the Ministry of Economy.  The General Manager 
of Banco Arab Espanol (BAE) informed Iranzo that BAE no 
longer holds Rasheed Bank assets, since the accounts were 
liquidated in 1992 after the first Gulf War.  Iranzo is 
awaiting an official written response from BAE.  Embassy will 
report any new information, as appropriate.
