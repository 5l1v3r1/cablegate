Summary and Guidance Request 
---------------------------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  The Holy See requested U.S. support in encouraging 
the Government of Italy and other interested parties to 
support the inclusion of the Italy-Somalia Forum for Peace 
and Reconstruction in the Somali peace negotiations.  In a 
February 25 meeting with poloff, Vatican Country Director for 
Somalia Lucio Sembrano described the current state of the 
Somali peace negotiations as critical.  Sembrano urged the 
U.S. to reassure Ethiopia and Somalia's other neighbors that 
a stable Somali government was in their best interest, and 
that they should support the ongoing negotiations.  We 
understand that this reflects current USG policy.  Please see 
guidance request at para. 6.  End Summary.

Vatican: Situation Urgent... 
---------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Vatican Country Director for Somalia Lucio 
Sembrano told us February 25 that the Holy See considered the 
Somali peace negotiations to be at a critical juncture, and 
requested U.S. support on two fronts.  As an indication of 
the urgency with which the Vatican sees the situation, 
Sembrano noted that the Vatican had intended to have its 
Foreign Minister raise the situation with the Ambassador, but 
instead decided to contact poloff to convey the information 
as soon as possible.

...and Precarious 
----------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Both Sembrano and a non-paper he passed us (faxed 
to AF/E and EUR/WE) noted the precarious state of current 
negotiations, noteworthy progress notwithstanding.  The Holy 
See ascribes some of the difficulty in making further 
progress to the exile of former Somali officials and 
intellectuals over ten years ago.  According to the Vatican 
non-paper, this left the nation with a "total lack of human 
resources and professional skills which are absolutely 
necessary for the success of any lasting and sustainable 
peace-making and reconstruction plan."  With current plans 
underway for appointments to a Somali parliament, the Holy 
See believes now is the time to involve a wider array of such 
people in the negotiating process. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Italy-Somalia Forum Should Have Role 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  According to the Holy See, the Italy-Somalia Forum 
for Peace and Reconstruction should have a role in the peace 
talks and in negotiations on the development of Somalia's 
transitional government.  The Vatican's non-paper reports 
that the Forum developed its own initiative to mediate among 
the various groups participating in the talks -- a process 
that showed great promise.  The Forum has reportedly involved 
and mobilized "the best intellectual and professional 
Somali(s)," most of whom are living in exile.  The Holy See 
believes it could be a useful tool for the international 
community in the reconstruction of Somalia, and concludes 
that the Forum's involvement "cannot be postponed 
indefinitely" and should be implemented in the shortest 
possible time.

Holy See Requests USG Help 
-------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  The Holy See asked for U.S. assistance in two 
ways: 
 
 
-- According to Sembrano, the Government of Italy has been 
lukewarm on the Forum's involvement in the Somali crisis. 
The Holy See requests that the U.S. approach the GOI and 
other relevant members of the international community to 
encourage their support of Forum participation in the peace 
negotiations. 
 
-- The Holy See also encouraged USG contact with the 
Government of Ethiopia to impress upon the GOE that Somali 
reconstruction is in its own long-term interest.  The Vatican 
asked the USG to encourage the GOE and other Somali neighbors 
not to disrupt Somali peace efforts.  Post understands the 
USG is already engaged on this front and is attempting to 
work with the international community to address the GOE's 
legitimate security concerns, while still making the point 
that a stable government in Somalia will be good for Ethiopia 
(ref a).

Guidance Request

¶6.  (SBU)  Post is attempting to get more information on 
Forum membership and modus operandi from its leadership in 
Rome that we will forward to Department (ref a).  We are also 
in contact with Embassy Rome on the issue (ref b).  Post 
requests guidance from Department to respond to the Holy See 
on the two issues raised in paragraph 5.
