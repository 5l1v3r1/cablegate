SUBJECT: EMERGENCY ACTION COMMITTEE MEETING - MADRID, SPAIN 
 
REF: STATE 64477 
 
¶1.  (U) Embassy Madrid Emergency Action Committee (EAC) met 
on 25 March 2004 as per REFTEL.  The EAC discussed the 
concerns and possible threat considerations as outlined.  The 
RSO stated that a Verbal Note was prepared for the Spanish 
Police requesting an augmentation of both static and dynamic 
police presence for the Embassy in Madrid, the Consulate 
General in Barcelona, and the six Consular Agencies. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Questions were addressed regarding the use of the 
surveillance detection elements, the special considerations 
of the Business International Center (BIC), and the general 
preparedness of all USG-Spain facilities.  It was presented 
that a small varying of assets, controls, numbers of police 
and other elements, keeps the potential enemy off-balance and 
unable to make a coherent plan of operation.  The RSO stated 
that this was exactly the course being followed but never 
allowing the security preparations to dip below a 100 percent 
level of coverage and control.  Only varying the coverage by 
levels of increase and change.  It was determined that the 
security measures in place meet all needs for the appropriate 
posture of strength. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Currently, due to the recent acts of terrorism in 
Madrid, RSO has provided copies of suspicious surveillance 
detection incident photos to the investigating police who are 
searching for any photographic correlation with their 
"wanted" list.  A "Duck and Cover" drill was conducted today 
and all security programs will continue to be monitored for 
maximum effectiveness.
