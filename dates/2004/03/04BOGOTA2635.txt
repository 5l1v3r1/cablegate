SUBJECT: DRAFT AGREEMENTS ON INTEGRATED INTELLIGENCE AND 
COMMUNICATIONS, AND LOGISTICS 
 
 
¶1.  At the request of the Vice Minister of National Defense 
(MOD) for Policy, MOD staff and Post (NAS and MilGp) have 
prepared two draft agreements (Appendices) that seek to 
integrate the MOD and the Colombian Military and National 
Police in the critical areas of intelligence and 
communications, and logistics. 
 
¶2.  Each Appendix is essentially a "framework" agreement 
that a) establishes the MOD policy to integrate efforts in 
these two areas, and b) permits USG to support current and 
future integration projects, which are attached as Sub- 
Appendices.  For example, the first two projects of the 
intelligence and communications agreement are a) the 
integration of counternarcotics voice communications systems 
of the police and the military (almost completed and highly 
successful), and b) the Colombian Imagery Library/Theater 
Intelligence Architecture sponsored by the National 
Geospatial Intelligence Agency and USSOUTHCOM.  The first 
logistics project provides aviation logistics management 
software (SAP) for the Colombian military.  Additional 
projects could be added to either agreement. 
 
¶3.  No additional funding is required to implement these 
agreements.  Funding for the initial integration projects is 
provided in other INL/NAS or DOD support programs, for 
example the NAS Antinarcotics Police budget (obligated under 
Appendix 1) funded the voice integration project.  NAS 
funding (approximately $4.5M) for the CNP phase of the 
aviation logistics software would also be obligated under 
Appendix 1.  The agreements are broad enough, however, to 
allow establishing new budget lines for future integration 
projects. 
 
¶4.  The draft agreements have been sent by email to INL/LP 
(Christie), USSOUTHCOM (SJS LTC Rose), and NGA (Gotay) for 
coordination of review and comment.  Unless otherwise 
advised by 29 March, we will process these agreements for 
signature in early April.
