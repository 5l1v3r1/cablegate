¶1. Embassy Wellington's designated point of contact for 
the Blue Lantern Program is: 
 
Joy Yamamoto 
Economic Officer 
Tel: 64-4-462-6182 
Fax: 64-4-472-3537 
E-mail: yamamotoJO@state.gov

¶2. Blue Lantern cases are coordinated with the 
Embassy's Defense Attache Office. 
 
¶3. The time frame for past Blue Lantern cases has 
ranged from weeks to months, with delays usually 
associated with bureaucratic inertia and not with 
policy differences. 
 
¶4. We are not aware of any local conditions that impede 
or affect working Blue Lantern cases.  Most of these 
cases involve government-to-government transfers, with 
our main interlocutor being the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and Trade.
