SUBJECT: ECUADOR SENDING ENGINEERS, TROOPS TO HAITI 
 
¶1.  The Government of Ecuador has directed that EC Army 
engineers and soldiers travel to Haiti to participate in 
UN-directed peacekeeping (PKO) operations and natural 
disaster (hurricane) relief.  Embassy officials learned 
September 23 that the first Ecuadorian deployment will 
include 66 combat engineers, heading to the Caribbean October 
16 as part of the Chilean contingent.  A second EC 
deployment, numbering 220, also is likely, and might assume 
southern Haiti duties now handled by Uruguayan soldiers. 
 
¶2.  Ecuador's high command enthusiastically supports the 
humanitarian mission, and the Embassy believes its forces can 
handle the demanding assignment.  Further, the EC joint 
command recently established an international peacekeeping 
training operation, and the UN just completed a PKO symposium 
in Ecuador. 
 
¶3.  COMMENT:  We too support Ecuador's involvement in 
multilateral peacekeeping and disaster assistance operations. 
 Experience gained working with the hemisphere's militaries 
in Haiti might even result in better cooperation with 
Colombia, a must if Ecuador desires an end to lawlessness and 
narcoterrorist incursions on its northern border.  END 
COMMENT.
