Â¶1.  (SBU) Pol/Econ chief September 21 delivered reftel 
demarche regarding the Tokyo donors' meeting for Iraq to MFA 
Director for Bilateral Affairs Dhafer Al-Umran.  He noted 
that he had already been approached by both the Japanese and 
Iraqis concerning Bahraini participation in the meeting.  He 
stated that the GOB considered it important to attend and 
participate in the meeting.  While his government had stated 
earlier that it could not afford to make a financial 
contribution, it was willing to contribute in kind.  For 
example, Bahrain would host an Iraqi delegation the week of 
September 25 for training on the operation of stock markets, 
and the Ministry of Interior would soon host training for 
Iraqi civil defense forces firefighting specialists.
