¶1. In a September 8 conversation with Econoff, Okay 
Kilic, Head of the Maritime Security Department of the 
Maritime Administration (MA), clarified that Turkey has 
not/not yet complied with all requirements of the 
International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea's 
(SOLAS) International Ship and Port Facility Security 
Code (ISPS). 
 
¶2. Kilic stated that Turkey has approved security 
assessments on all/all 154 port facilities.  146 of 
these facilities have submitted security plans, and the 
Maritime Administration has approved 121 of these plans. 
According to Kilic, the eight facilities which have not 
submitted plans are very minor ones with limited foreign 
trade.  The 25 facilities which submitted plans awaiting 
MA approval do include major ports run by the Turkish 
Railway Administration such as Haydarpasa (Istanbul), 
Samsun, Iskenderun and Mersin.  Kilic stated that, 
despite the fact that their plans have not yet been 
approved, these ports have put security measures in 
place.  MA is reviewing their plans carefully and 
conducting site visits, and Kilic expects all 
outstanding plans to be completed within the next two 
weeks. 
 
¶3. Kilic reiterated that lack of identification numbers 
for some facilities may prevent other users of the 
International Maritime Organization (IMO) database from 
accessing complete information on Turkish port security. 
He recommended accessing MA's website 
(www.denizcilik.gov.tr/isps/Safe_Ports) for current 
information. 
 
¶4. We note that the September 16 visit of International 
Port Security Liaison Officer LCDR Michael Bee to Ankara 
and the upcoming visit of Kilic to a U.S. port provide 
opportunities to exchange information and reinforce the 
need to complete ISPS requirements as soon as possible.
