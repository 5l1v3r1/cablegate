OFFICIALS ON SEPTEMBER 9 AND 10, 2004. 
 
 
  ¶1.    THIS  CABLE  IS SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.   NOT 
     INTENDED FOR INTERNET DISTRIBUTION 
 
  ¶2.   (SBU) SUMMARY: ON SEPTEMBER 9 AND 10, DEPUTY 
     ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR EUROPE ERIC STEWART TRAVELED TO 
     ANKARA TO MEET WITH GOVERNMENT OF TURKEY OFFICIALS ON KEY 
     BILATERAL ISSUES.  THE DAS MET WITH OFFICIALS FROM THE 
     MINISTRIES OF HEALTH, AGRICULTURE,JUSTICE,ENERGY,AND 
     UNDERSECRETARIATS FOR FOREIGN TRADE, TREASURY, AND EU 
     AFFAIRS.  BILATERAL ISSUES RAISED INCLUDED 
     PHARMACEUTICALS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS 
     PROTECTION, ENERGY INVESTMENT DISPUTES, AGRI-BUSINESS 
     TRADE ISSUES, AND FAILURE TO ENFORCE INTERNATIONAL 
     ARBITRAL AWARDS.  WHILE IN TURKEY, HE ALSO MET WITH THE 
     PHARMACEUTICALS LOCAL ACTION WORKING GROUP, LED A 
     ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSION WITH THE AMERICAN BUSINESS FORUM, 
     AND MET WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF CARGILL AND ADM ON AGRI- 
     BUSINESS ISSUES.  THE DAS LED A VIDEOCONFERENCE ON IRAQ 
     RECONSTRUCTION AND HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE WITH TWENTY- 
     FIVE MEMBERS OF THE MEDIA (INCLUDING PRINT AND T.V.). 
     THE DAS WAS ACCOMPANIED BY DESK OFFICER DAVID DE FALCO. 
     END SUMMARY. 
 
 ¶3. (SBU) MEETING AT THE UNDERSECRETARIAT FOR FOREIGN 
 TRADE WITH DEPUTY UNDER SECRETARY GUZEL: DAS STEWART 
 THANKED THE GOT FOR ITS SUPPORT AGAINST THE WAR ON 
 TERROR, INCLUDING RECONSTRUCTION EFFORTS.  HE ALSO 
 HIGHLIGHTED TURKEY'S IMPORTANCE AS A KEY-TRADING ALLY, 
 DUE TO ITS GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION AND DEMOGRAPHICS.  IN 
 2003, THE UNITED STATES EXPORTED OVER $2.9 BILLION TO 
 TURKEY AND IMPORTED $3.7 BILLION, AND U.S. COMPANIES 
 HAVE INVESTED APPROXIMATELY $2 BILLION IN TURKEY (2003 
 HISTORICAL COST FIGURES). 
 
 ¶4. (SBU) DAS STEWART URGED TURKEY TO TAKE STEPS TO 
 IMPROVE ITS INVESTMENT CLIMATE TO ATTRACT FOREIGN 
 CAPITAL.  AS TRADE TENDS TO FOLLOW INVESTMENT, A 
 STRONGER TURKISH INVESTMENT CLIMATE WILL HELP INCREASE 
 TRADE VOLUMES. 
 
 ¶5. (SBU) DAS STEWART RAISED USG CONCERN ABOUT THE GOT'S 
 DECISION TO WAIT UNTIL DECEMBER 31, 2007, TO PROTECT 
 CONFIDENTIAL TEST DATA.  TURKEY IS NOT IN COMPLIANCE 
 WITH ITS TRIPS OBLIGATIONS - PROTECTION IN THIS AREA 
 SHOULD HAVE COMMENCED IN 2000.  LACK OF PROTECTION FOR 
 CONFIDENTIAL TEST DATA THREATENS THE COMMERCIAL 
 POSITION OF SEVERAL U.S. FIRMS AND WILL HINDER CURRENT 
 AND FUTURE INVESTMENT IN THE TURKISH MARKET. 
 ADDITIONALLY, HE ASKED THAT TURKEY CEASE APPROVING ANY 
 COPIES OF PATENTED PRODUCTS.  DAS STEWART ASKED THAT 
 THE GOT ESTABLISH AN INTER-MINISTERIAL WORKING GROUP TO 
 DISCUSS THESE ISSUES WITH INNOVATIVE PHARMACEUTICAL 
 PRODUCERS. 
 
 ¶6. (SBU) DAS STEWART ENCOURAGED TURKEY TO STEP UP 
 ENFORCEMENT MEASURES TO ADDRESS PRODUCTION OF 
 COUNTERFEIT TRADEMARKED AND PIRATED COPYRIGHTED WORKS 
 SUCH AS APPAREL, OPTICAL MEDIA, AND BOOKS. 
 
 ¶7. (SBU) ON ENERGY INVESTMENT, WE EXPECT THE GOT TO 
 RESPECT ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE INTERNATIONALLY 
 BINDING CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS WITH INDEPENDENT POWER 
 PRODUCERS.  HE ENCOURAGED THE GOT TO RESOLVE ANY 
 OUTSTANDING DISPUTES THROUGH DIALOGUE AND REFRAIN FROM 
 TAKING EXTRA JUDICIAL STEPS SUCH AS UNILATERAL 
 CANCELLATION OF BOT CONTRACTS.  ADDITIONALLY, HONORING 
 THE EXCHANGE RATE GUARANTEE FOR EXISTING REGISTERED 
 CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IS NON-NEGOTIABLE FOR FOREIGN OIL 
 AND GAS COMPANIES. 
 
 ¶8. (SBU) THE DAS NOTED HIS PLEASURE WITH THE PASSAGE OF 
 AMENDMENTS TO THE ZONING LAW THAT ALLOW CARGILL TO 
 OPERATE ITS FACILITY FREE OF LEGAL ENCUMBRANCES.  HE 
 DID, HOWEVER, NOTE THAT THE SUGAR LAW, WHICH PLACES A 
 QUOTA ON THE PRODUCTION OF CORN SYRUP, WILL FORCE U.S. 
 COMPANIES TO REEVALUATE THEIR $170 MILLION WORTH OF 
 INVESTMENTS.  HE ASKED THAT THE GOT FIND A WAY TO 
 ACCOMMODATE THE CONCERNS OF THE HIGH-FRUCTOSE CORN 
 SYRUP INDUSTRY. 
 
 ¶9. (SBU) THE DAS RAISED CONCERNS IN THE DISTILLED 
 SPIRITS INDUSTRY OVER THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN IMPORT 
 REGIME THAT IS NON- TRANSPARENT AND THE IMPLEMENTATION 
 OF NEW STANDARDS REGARDING SUPERIOR ALCOHOLS. 
 
 ¶10. (SBU) THE DAS APPLAUDED TURKEY FOR ADOPTING THE EU 
 NEW APPROACH DIRECTIVES AND BELIEVES THAT MEETING 
 EUROPEAN AND INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS DOES AFFORD 
 GREATER CONSUMER, WORKER, AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. 
 HOWEVER, HE NOTED INCONSISTENCY WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION 
 OF THE DIRECTIVES IN TURKEY.  SPECIFICALLY, THE TURKISH 
 CUSTOMS SERVICE IS CLEARING CE-MARKED PRODUCTS 
 ORIGINATING IN THE EU AND DELAYING THE ENTRY OF CE- 
 MARKED PRODUCTS FROM COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE EU. 
 
 ¶11. (SBU) THE DAS CONCLUDED HIS REMARKS BY ASKING THE 
 UNDERSECRETARIAT FOR SUPPORT IN RESOLVING THESE TRADE 
 AND INVESTMENT ISSUES.  HE ASKED THAT THE DEPUTY UNDER 
 SECRETARY JOIN HIM IN A DIALOGUE AIMED AT MOVING THESE 
 ISSUES THROUGH THE VARIOUS LINE MINISTRIES. 
 
 ¶12. (SBU) DEPUTY UNDER SECRETARY GUZEL AGREED THAT IN 
 ORDER TO ATTRACT FURTHER INVESTMENT TO TURKEY MANY OF 
 THE OUTSTANDING DISPUTES WOULD HAVE TO BE RESOLVED. 
 SHE WAS FAMILIAR WITH MANY OF THE MATTERS LISTED AND 
 UNDERSTOOD THE NEED TO WORK WITH INDUSTRY AND THE USG 
 TO ADDRESS THEM.  SHE ALSO AGREED TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY 
 INTER-MINISTERIAL DIALOGUE WITH INNOVATIVE 
 PHARMACEUTICALS PRODUCERS ON PHARMACEUTICALS ISSUES. 
 THE DEPUTY UNDER SECRETARY AGREED TO CONTINUE THIS 
 EXCHANGE WITH THE DAS AND TO WORK WITH THE LINE 
 MINISTRIES TO RESOLVE OUTSTANDING ISSUES. 
 
 ¶13. (SBU) MEETING AT THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH WITH 
 DIRECTOR GENERAL GUMRUKCUOGLU: THE DAS RAISED USG 
 CONCERNS OVER THE LACK OF DATA EXCLUSIVITY AND 
 IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW REIMBURSEMENT REGIME THAT MAY 
 INCLUDE THE CREATION OF A POSITIVE LIST.  THE DAS URGED 
 THE MOH TO PARTICIPATE IN AN INTER-MINISTERIAL DIALOGUE 
 WITH INDUSTRY OVER THE CREATION OF A NEW REIMBURSEMENT 
 REGIME IN TURKEY. 
 
 ¶14. (SBU) THE DIRECTOR GENERAL ACKNOWLEDGED 
 DIFFICULTIES WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF DATA 
 EXCLUSIVITY, BUT ASSURED US THAT THE LAW HAD BEEN 
 DRAFTED AND THAT IT WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED BY THE 
 DECEMBER 2007 DATE.  HE HIGHLIGHTED THE COST OF 
 IMPLEMENTATION AS A MAJOR FACTOR FOR THE DELAY.  HE 
 NOTED THAT THE POSITIVE LIST HAD NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED 
 YET AND THAT IT WAS NOT THE MOH'S INTENTION TO 
 DISCOURAGE IMPORTS WITH THE CREATION OF SUCH A LIST. 
 HE PROMISED TO WORK WITH INDUSTRY OVER THE DEVELOPMENT 
 OF NEW REIMBURSEMENT POLICIES AND AGREED TO PARTICIPATE 
 IN ANY INTER-MINISTERIAL DISCUSSIONS HELD WITH 
 INNOVATIVE PRODUCERS OVER THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SUCH 
 POLICIES. 
 
 ¶15. (SBU) MEETING AT THE UNDERSECRETARIAT OF TREASURY 
 WITH UNDER SECRETARY CANAKCI: DAS STEWART HIGHLIGHTED 
 TURKEY'S NEED TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT FRIENDLY TO 
 FOREIGN INVESTMENT IF IT WISHES TO ATTRACT CAPITAL. 
 TURKEY HAS TAKEN A NUMBER OF STEPS, WHICH SERVE TO 
 CREATE UNCERTAINTY IN THE MARKET.  THESE INCLUDE, AN 
 INABILITY TO RESOLVE OUTSTANDING ENERGY CONTRACTS AND 
 THE REFUSAL TO HONOR THE EXCHANGE RATE GUARANTEE FOR 
 EXISTING ENERGY INVESTMENTS.  HE ENCOURAGED THE GOT TO 
 OPEN A DIALOGUE WITH FOREIGN INVESTORS TO CLARIFY THE 
 STATUS OF PROJECTS. 
 
 ¶16. (SBU) THE UNDER SECRETARY SHARED THE DAS' CONCERNS 
 AND UNDERSTOOD THE NEED TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT THAT 
 WILL ATTRACT NEEDED INVESTMENT.  THE UNDER SECRETARY 
 NOTED THAT ENERGY PROJECTS (ESPECIALLY THE HYDRO-POWER 
 PROJECTS) HAD RUN INTO FINANCING ISSUES BECAUSE OF THE 
 IMF REQUIREMENT THAT TURKEY CUT ITS PRIMARY SURPLUS TO 
 6.5 PERCENT OF GDP.  HE ASSURED US THAT THE GOT WAS 
 WORKING ON A SOLUTION FOR THE EXCHANGE RATE GUARANTEE. 
 HE ASKED THAT THE DAS PASS ALONG A LIST OF PROBLEM 
 ENERGY PROJECTS AND HE WOULD DO WHAT HE COULD TO WORK 
 WITH THE MINISTRY OF ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES AND 
 INDUSTRY TO DISCUSS NEXT STEPS. 
 
 ¶17. (SBU) MEETING AT MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE WITH UNDER 
 SECRETARY CAGIL:  DAS STEWART RAISED USG CONCERNS OVER 
 THE MANY STEPS TAKEN BY THE GOT THAT LIMIT ACCESS FOR 
 U.S. EXPORTERS.  THEY INCLUDE: AN ONEROUS, NON- 
 TRANSPARENT LICENSING REGIME FOR DISTILLED SPIRITS; 
 HIGH AD VALOREM TAXES AND A SUPERIOR ALCOHOL STANDARD 
 FOR DISTILLED SPIRITS; A SUGAR QUOTA THAT CAPS CAPACITY 
 OF U.S. PLANTS AT APPROXIMATELY FIFTY PERCENT; A SEED 
 CRUSHING TARIFF INCREASE OF SEVEN PERCENT WITHOUT 
 NOTIFICATION OR DISCUSSION WITH INDUSTRY; AND A WTO- 
 INCONSISTENT POLICY WITH REGARDS TO RICE QUOTAS.  HE 
 NOTED THAT THE RICE ISSUE WOULD BE TAKEN UP DURING THIS 
 MONTH'S ROUND OF WTO AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE MEETINGS. 
 
 ¶18. (SBU) THE DAS ASKED THE UNDER SECRETARY ABOUT 
 TURKEY'S PLANS WITH REGARDS TO ACCEPTING GMO PRODUCTS. 
 ¶19. (SBU) UNDER SECRETARY CAGIL ADMITTED THAT HIS 
 MINISTRY FACED DIFFICULT DECISIONS BECAUSE IT HAD TO 
 BALANCE TRADE INTERESTS WITH DOMESTIC PRODUCERS' 
 INTERESTS.  HE FELT CONFIDENT THAT THE ISSUES COULD BE 
 RESOLVED THROUGH AN OPEN DIALOGUE WITH THE AFFECTED 
 COMPANIES. 
 
 ¶20. (SBU) ON THE DISTILLED SPIRITS ISSUE, HE NOTED THAT 
 A LAW WOULD COME INTO EFFECT OVER THE NEXT MONTH THAT 
 WOULD CREATE THE CODEX COMMISSION AND BEGIN 
 HARMONIZATION WITH EU AGRICULTURE DIRECTIVES - WHICH 
 WOULD ADDRESS MOST OF THESE CONCERNS.  ON THE SEED 
 CRUSHING ISSUE HE DEFERRED TO THE EXPERTS, BUT SAID HE 
 BELIEVED THE TARIFF WOULD BE TEMPORARY AND OFFERED TO 
 INTERVENE WITH THE COMPANY TO CLEAR UP ANDY 
 UNCERTAINTIES. 
 
 ¶21. (SBU) ON THE RICE QUOTA ISSUE, THE UNDER SECRETARY 
 CONFIRMED THAT THE PRACTICE WAS TO PROTECT LOCAL 
 PRODUCERS AND HE COMPLAINED THAT THE PRICE OF RICE IN 
 TURKEY WAS EXTREMELY HIGH.  THE REQUIREMENTS TURKEY HAS 
 IMPLEMENTED SERVE TO ENSURE THE PURCHASE OF TURKISH 
 RICE. HE CLAIMED THERE WAS NO IMPORT BAN AND THAT THE 
 MINISTRY WAS FORCED TO TAKE THIS STEP BECAUSE IT WAS 
 DIRECTED TO DO SO BY MINISTERIAL DECREE. 
 
 ¶22. (SBU) IN RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION REGARDING GMOS, 
 THE UNDER SECRETARY SAID THAT TURKEY WOULD FOLLOW THE 
 EU'S LEAD.  HE PERSONALLY FELT THE PRODUCTS SHOULD BE 
 ALLOWED INTO THE COUNTRY IF THEY ARE PROPERLY LABELED. 
 
 ¶23. (SBU) MEETING AT UNDERSECRETARIAT FOR EU AFFAIRS 
 WITH DIRECTOR CAN:  THE DAS RAISED THREE ISSUES WITH 
 THE DIRECTOR THAT RELATE DIRECTLY TO TURKEY'S 
 HARMONIZATION WITH EU DIRECTIVES.  THE THREE ISSUES 
 WERE: INCONSISTENT CE-MARK ENFORCEMENT; LACK OF DATA 
 EXCLUSIVITY FOR PHARMACEUTICAL TEST DATA; AND GOT 
 IMPLEMENTATION OF SUPERIOR ALCOHOL STANDARDS. 
 
 ¶24. (SBU) DIRECTOR CAN NOTED THAT THE UNDERSECRETARIAT 
 WAS HAVING DIFFICULTIES IN EDUCATING LINE MINISTRIES ON 
 EU HARMONIZATION.  SHE WAS VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE DATA 
 EXCLUSIVITY ISSUE AND TOLD THE DAS THAT ONE OF HER 
 COLLEAGUES WAS WATCHING THE ISSUE VERY CLOSELY (AN EU 
 TRADE BARRIER REPORT ON TURKEY THAT HIGHLIGHTS 
 DEFICIENCIES WITH THE PROTECTION OF DATA EXCLUSIVITY IS 
 EXPECTED TO COME OUT IN OCTOBER).  ON THE DISTILLED 
 SPIRITS ISSUE, THE DIRECTOR CONFIRMED WHAT WE HEARD AT 
 THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE WITH REGARD TO THE CREATION 
 OF THE CODEX COMMISSION WITHIN THE MONTH.  SHE ALSO 
 CONFIRMED THAT A DRAFT LAW ON DISTILLED SPIRITS HAD 
 ALREADY BEEN DRAFTED AND COULD BE IMPLEMENTED QUICKLY. 
 FINALLY, ON THE CE-MARK ISSUE SHE EXPRESSED FRUSTRATION 
 OVER GETTING THE LINE MINISTRIES TO UNDERSTAND THEIR 
 DUTIES AND PROMISED TO GET AN UPDATE TO THE DAS ON THE 
 MATTER WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS. 
 
 ¶25. (SBU) MEETING AND MINISTRY OF ENERGY AND NATURAL 
 RESOURCES WITH UNDER SECRETARY DEMIRBILEK: DAS STEWART 
 RAISED USG CONCERNS OVER THE GOT'S INABILITY TO MOVE 
 FORWARD ON BOT PROJECTS WITH SIGNED CONTRACTS.  WHILE 
 THE USG UNDERSTANDS THE DIFFICULTY OF MOVING FORWARD ON 
 ALL THE PROJECTS, THE COMPANIES ARE FRUSTRATED THAT 
 THEY HAVE NOT RECEIVED STATUS UPDATES.  THE DAS ASKED 
 THE MINISTRY TO WORK WITH COMPANIES INTERESTED IN THE 
 NINE PROTOCOL HYDROPOWER PROJECTS.  HE URGED TURKEY TO 
 RESOLVE THE EXCHANGE RATE GUARANTEE ISSUE AND ADDRESS A 
 PROBLEM TOREADOR RESOURCES FACES WITH OBTAINING A BLACK 
 SEA LICENSE - WHICH THE COMPANY CLAIMS WAS GIVEN TO 
 TPAO CONTRARY TO THE PETROLEUM LAW OF 1954 (THIS MATTER 
 IS CURRENTLY WORKING ITS WAY THROUGH THE TURKISH 
 JUDICIAL SYSTEM). 
 
 ¶26. (SBU) THE UNDER SECRETARY ASSURED US THAT A 
 RESOLUTION TO THE BOT PROBLEM WOULD BE REACHED AND THAT 
 IT WOULD FALL WITHIN THE PARAMETERS OF THE SIGNED 
 CONTRACTS.  HE ALSO APPEARED NOT TO BE CONCERNED OVER 
 PENDING LAW SUITS.  ON THE EXCHANGE RATE ISSUE, HE TOLD 
 US THAT THE GOT WOULD RESOLVE THE PROBLEM BY ALLOWING 
 INVESTORS TO REPATRIATE PROFITS, UP TO THE AMOUNT OF 
 THE INITIAL INVESTMENT, FREE OF TAXES - A SOLUTION HE 
 CLAIMS WAS REACHED WITH INDUSTRY INPUT.  ON THE LICENSE 
 ISSUE, HE CLAIMS THAT EVERYTHING THE MINISTRY DID WAS 
 LEGAL.  HE ALLEGES THAT THE PETROLEUM LAW OF 1954 HAS 
 AN EXEMPTION FOR OFF-SHORE DRILLING WHICH ALLOWS TPAO 
 TO RECEIVE THE LICENSE. 
 
 ¶27. (SBU) MEETING AT THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE WITH UNDER 
 SECRETARY KASIRGA: DAS STEWART CONGRATULATED THE UNDER 
 SECRETARY FOR HIS MINISTRY'S ROLE IN PROMOTING IP 
 PROTECTION AND WORKING WITH THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF 
 JUSTICE AND PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE ON THE 
 SEPTEMBER IP SEMINAR.  THE DAS RAISED USG CONCERNS OVER 
 HIGH PIRACY LEVELS IN TURKEY, THE LACK OF DATA 
 EXCLUSIVITY, AND THE FAILURE OF SOME TURKISH COURTS TO 
 ENFORCE INTERNATIONAL ARBITRAL AWARDS. 
 
 ¶28.  (SBU)  THE  UNDER  SECRETARY REMAINS  COMMITTED  TO 
 ENFORCE  IP LAWS AND NOTED THE INTEREST ON THE  PART  OF 
 HIS   MINISTRY  TO  CONTINUE  TO  EDUCATE   JUDGES   AND 
 PROSECUTORS.   HE HIGHLIGHTED THE FACT THAT  TURKEY  HAS 
 SEVEN  SPECIALIZED IP COURTS WHOSE JUDGES WERE  REQUIRED 
 TO  STUDY  IP LAWS IN EUROPE FOR ONE YEAR.  HE  WAS  NOT 
 FAMILIAR  WITH THE DATA EXCLUSIVITY ISSUE  AND  DIRECTED 
 US TO THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH. 
 
 ¶29. (SBU) ON THE ARBITRATION ISSUE, HE WAS SURPRISED  TO 
 HEAR  ABOUT  THE PROBLEM.  HE ASKED THAT WE SEND  HIM  A 
 PAPER  DETAILING  OUR COMPLAINT SO THAT  HE  CAN  ASSIGN 
 LAWYERS  ON HIS STAFF TO INVESTIGATE.  HE ASKED THAT  WE 
 NAME  THE COURTS RENDERING THESE JUDGEMENTS AND PROMISED 
 TO GET BACK TO US WITH HIS FINDINGS.
