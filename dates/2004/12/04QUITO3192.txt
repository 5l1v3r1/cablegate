¶1.  After checking with the MFA, we have been unable to 
confirm any recent Ecuadorian government actions to advance 
democracy, human rights, and fundamental freedoms in Cuba. 
Ecuador abstained from the UNHRC Cuban human rights 
resolution in 2004.  Further information on this subject may 
be available through the EC mission in Geneva, according to 
the MFA.  As far as we know, the GOE does not maintain 
information on investments by Ecuadorian individuals or 
entities in Cuba.  We are verifying that with the Finance 
Ministry and will report any additional information SepTel.
