REF: BAGHDAD 2282 
 
¶1. (SBU) The Charge called senior Turkish MFA Special Envoy 
on Iraq, Ambassador Ahmed Koruturk, regarding the fuel 
shortages in Iraq and the Turkish truckers' strike.  Charge 
informed Koruturk that the severity of fuel shortages in Iraq 
was growing, pointing out that the truckers' strike was a 
contributing, but not the sole, factor. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Charge noted that we were getting mixed messages 
from different parties: Iraq Ministry of Oil, SOMO, and 
Turkish contractors.  Note: Post's continues to hear from 
Turkish contractors that communication from SOMO is 
inadequate. End Note.  The Charge encouraged the Turkish 
authorities to talk to contractors to make sure the 
contractors are communicating to SOMO what they think is 
necessary to resolve the strike. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Koruturk agreed this was a serious problem and one 
that the GOT would like to contribute to solving.  Though 
commercial issues are important, Koruturk felt security 
issues were also still important.  He said he would instruct 
his colleagues to speak to the contractors about engaging 
with SOMO. 
 
¶4. (U) Baghdad Minimize considered.
