¶1. (SBU) Embassy conveyed reftel points to officials at 
Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism (DEAT) and 
Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA).  According to DEAT's 
Director for International Relations, Zaheer Fakir, his 
Department was invited but never participated in discussions 
regarding future governance of UNEP, and DEAT does not 
support the French proposal. 
 
¶2. (SBU) DFA Multilateral Branch's Deputy Director for 
Conservation Elize Haber told EST Officer that South 
Africa's Ambassador to Nairobi attended the Stockholm 
meetings, which focused on UNEP's governing body rather than 
creation of a UN Environment Organization (UNEO).  She noted 
that in light of South Africa's strong interest in UN 
reform, it remains open to discussion with France about its 
proposal.  At present South Africa is unconvinced of the 
merits of transforming UNEP to a UNEO.  The SAG believes the 
current governance structure works well.  It shares USG 
concerns about the potential effectiveness of UNEO and the 
financial impact of creating UNEO, particularly on 
developing countries.  In addition, South Africa is 
concerned about a possible move of any new organization from 
Nairobi to a location outside Africa.  Haber also commented 
that her DEAT colleague did not appear to have complete 
information about the issue.
