REF: A. SECSTATE 248010 
 
On December 13, Poloff met with MFA Continental Asia Office 
Director Carlos Morales Sanchez to discuss REF A action 
request.  Morales stated that Spain recognized the 
seriousness of the narcotics problem within the international 
community and expressed his concern about the opium 
production in Afghanistan.  He cited Spain's continuing 
support to Operation Enduring Freedom and its recent 
additional assistance in regard to the Afghan elections as 
examples of its commitment to assist the people of 
Afghanistan.  Morales stated that the GOS would examine 
various options in regard to providing assistance in the 
counternarcotics field.  However, the GOS could not provide a 
concrete response at this time as to the nature of such 
assistance due to the fact that the 2005 budget is still 
pending and probably won't be approved until January.
