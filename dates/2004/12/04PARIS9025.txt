¶1.  (U) As per reftel, Poloff spoke to MFA DAS-equivalent for 
Human Rights in the Directorate of United Nations and 
International Organizations Affairs Beatrice le Fraper du 
Hellen about the need to lobby third countries against 
supporting any "no action motions" that might be brought by 
Iran or Turkmenistan.  Ms. Fraper du Hellen indicated that 
France was actively working to fight against efforts to 
undermine draft UN resolutions critical of human rights 
practices, and that the GOF had spoken to a number of 
countries about opposing possible no action motions and in 
support of the resolutions on Sudan and Zimbabwe. 
 
¶2.  (U) According to Ms. Fraper du Hellen, the GOF had asked 
the following countries to vote in line with US/EU positions 
or, at worst, abstain: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Brunei, Central 
African Republic, Comoros, Djibouti, Equitorial Guinea, 
Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Honduras, Laos, Moldova, Niger, 
Tajikistan, Togo.  Ms. Fraper du Hellen indicated that most 
countries indicated that they "took note" or would "consider" 
GOF requests.  Armenia indicated it hesitated voting against 
Iran because of an upcoming visit by the Armenian President 
to Tehran.  Niger said it would vote in line with the Islamic 
States -- in favor of Iran.  However, Fraper du Hellen seemed 
encouraged that efforts to switch third country votes would 
fail to garner enough support to pass motions of no action.
