SUBJECT: GOV REQUESTS SUPPORT FOR CANDIDATE TO UN HUMAN 
RIGHTS COMMITTEE 
 
 
¶1.  (U)  In a Diplomatic Note dated November 11 and received 
in the Embassy December 2, Venezuela's Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs requests USG support for Venezuela's candidate to 
fill a seat on the UN Human Rights Committee.  The note 
refers to the candidacy that Venezuela put forward in May 
2004 for one of three vacancies reserved for Latin American 
and Caribbean countries, but does not contain a name.  The 
vote is to take place in May 2005 in the Economic and Social 
Council, according to the Note. 
 
¶2.  (U)  The note explains that the GOV interest in filling 
the seat derives from the "process of profound changes and 
transformations in which Venezuela's institutions are 
engaged."  The election of the Venezuelan candidate will 
highlight the GOV's "firm disposition to respect, promote and 
protect the human rights of all Venezuelans."  The note ends 
by noting the value of the USG's support, and by noting that 
such support will help solidify our bilateral relations, and 
reinforce the work of the Committee.
