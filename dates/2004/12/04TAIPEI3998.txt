"China's Interpretation of [the Outcome] of Taiwan's 
Legislative Elections Is Completely Wrong" 
 
The pro-independence "Liberty Times" said in an 
editorial (12/16): 
 
". In short, the outcome of last Saturday's legislative 
elections has, only for the time being, marked an end 
to the rapid expansion of Pan-Green power over the past 
few years. . The key point of last Saturday's 
legislative elections was a confrontation between the 
powers of different political parties rather than a 
race [related to] the ideals and directions of these 
parties.  It is, without doubt, not a public vote on 
Taiwan's national status or the argument concerning 
unification or independence.  China's misinterpretation 
of the outcome of the legislative elections, a natural 
result of its ideological prejudices, has fully 
demonstrated that Beijing has no idea of what democracy 
or Taiwan's mainstream public opinion is.  In forming 
its Taiwan policy based on such false knowledge, China 
will surely strengthen its confrontational attitude, 
suppression, containment and isolation [of Taiwan]. 
There is definitely no possibility for the two sides to 
engage in a dialogue or reconciliation.  As a result, 
the answer to the question regarding who is the biggest 
source of turmoil in the Asia-Pacific region 
jeopardizing its stability and prosperity is already 
self-evident."
