SUBJECT: RAYTHEON BRIEFS AMBASSADOR ON MISSILE DEFENSE
CONSULTATIONS WITH CANADIANS
Classified By: POL M/C BRIAN FLORA. REASON 1.4 (b) and (d).
¶1. (C/NF) SUMMARY: In a December 8 office call, Raytheon
representatives (U.S. and Canadian) briefed the Ambassador
and mission officers on recent meetings with Canadian
Ambassador Kergin in Washington and senators on Parliament
Hill. Raytheon assesses that the Canadian government "may be
interested" in finding a way to host the X-Band Radar (MLX)
on Canadian soil. It is proposing a joint Canadian/USG and
industry study to examine elements of a Canadian contribution
to missile defense. END SUMMARY.
¶2. (C/NF) US VP for Ballistic Missile Defense Systems (BMDS)
Peter Franklin said that Raytheon's meeting with Ambassador
Kergin and Canadian defense attache RADM Mack went very well;
both officials were receptive to what Raytheon had to say.
At the Canadian Embassy's request, the Missile Defense Agency
(MDA) was scheduled to provide a classified briefing next
week regarding the potential benefit (to the MD system) of a
radar based in eastern Canada.
¶3. (C/NF) Franklin characterized the luncheon with fourteen
senators as particularly useful and generally positive.
Business Development Manager Dennis McKay commented that the
senators' principal concerns were consistent with those
articulated by other Canadians both publicly and privately:
i.e., a) what happens to NORAD cooperation if Canada doesn't
participate in MD; b) the effect/impact of debris from a
missile intercept on the environment and humans; and c) the
financial implications for Canada of participation in missile
defense. Franklin noted that Raytheon was proposing a joint
government and industry dialogue that would address the
senators' concerns and also inform Canadians of the range of
options for and benefits of MD particpation.
¶3. (C/NF) Ambassador Cellucci welcomed Raytheon's read-out
and thanked them for their initiative with Canadian
officials. He noted that Defense Minister Graham and Senator
Colin Kenny had spoken out in favor of missile defense, and
many other government interlocutors agreed that it made sense
for Canada. The problem was political, the Ambassador
continued, compounded by a lack of leadership in the
governing party and the Opposition. The Prime Minister was
psychologically hamstrung by his party's "minority" status in
the Parliament, and the Conservatives had decided to play
politics with national security. Without an assurance of
Conservative support, the governing Liberals did not dare
move forward on missile defense. Asked what Raytheon could
do to try and turn things around, the Ambassador urged
Raytheon representatives to talk to Conservative Opposition
Leader Stephen Harper. "Tell him I sent you," he quipped,
adding that he himself would continue to work on persuading
Mr. Harper to change tack for the good of the country.
¶4. (C/NF) In a separate meeting, a Canadian Raytheon
representative (protect) told polmiloff that Defense Minister
Graham's staff, at the Minister's behest, were brainstorming
proposals to try and advance Canadian participation in
missile defense. One of Graham's executive assistants wanted
to know informally (without directly approaching the Embassy)
if the USG would be receptive to Canada hosting the X-Band
Radar "as part of NORAD" rather than as explicit
participation in missile defense. Polmiloff responded that
it might be useful to explore this line of thought with the
parties involved and invited the Minister's staff to contact
Mission staff.
