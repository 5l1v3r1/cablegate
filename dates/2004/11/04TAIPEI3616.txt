¶1. Summary. In July 2004, Taiwan's Environmental Protection 
Administration (TEPA) introduced a draft rule to limit 
excessive packaging.  In response to industry opposition to 
the rule, TEPA issued a  revised draft of the rule on 
October 12.  As reported in ref A, the second draft is much 
narrower in scope than the original. Costco and Proctor and 
Gamble, which initially strongly opposed the rule, are now 
both satisfied with the changes and with TEPA's response to 
their concerns.  End Summary. 
 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
¶2.  As reported in Refs A-D, TEPA is eager to finalize 
regulations to restrict excessive packaging of goods in 
order to reduce waste, and move Taiwan towards its ultimate 
goal of complete recycling and zero waste by 2020. 
Initially TEPA was hoping to finalize the rule by September 
¶2004.  However, in part due to the strong negative reaction 
of foreign industry as reported in reftel B, TEPA has 
redrafted the rule and postponed its time-line for 
implementation. 
 
US COMPANIES SATISFIED WITH CHANGES 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  As reported in Ref A, the second draft of the rule 
issued on October 12 significantly narrowed the scope of the 
rule.  Following the issuance of the draft, AIT informed 
both AmCham and key US companies of the changes and of the 
deadline to comment.  In anticipation of the comment 
deadline at the end of this month, AIT followed up with the 
two US companies, which had expressed the most opposition 
to the initial draft of the rule.  Those companies, Costco 
and Proctor and Gamble, are now both satisfied with the 
changes to the rule and with TEPA's willingness to work with 
them to accommodate their concerns.  Neither company plans 
to submit any formal comments as all of their major concerns 
have already been addressed.
