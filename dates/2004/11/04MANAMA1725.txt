REF: STATE 225232 
 
(U) On October 25, EconOff met with Mohammed Al Juman, 
Director of Air Navigation at Civil Aviation Affairs and 
passed reftel letter from John Hancock, acting Director of 
International Aviation, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
on pre-payment for FAA technical assistance.  Al Juman noted 
GOB desire for increased cooperation with the FAA and raised 
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) plans to develop a system to 
manage regional airspace.  He underscored the need for 
well-tested systems and indicated that Europe had already 
expressed an interest in providing that assistance.  However, 
he said, the GCC wants to devise a system "right for the 
region," and there remained a strong preference among the 
Gulf states for a mechanism that would incorporate what they 
felt were the best elements of both the U.S. and EU systems. 
Al Juman also raised Bahrain's interest in becoming a 
regional training hub for pilots and negotiations with a 
Boeing subsidiary -- Alteon -- for the purchase and operation 
of flight simulators.
