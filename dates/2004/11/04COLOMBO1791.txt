REF: STATE 219260 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: On October 29, Ambassador delivered reftel 
points and non-paper to FM Kadirgamar.  Poloff had spoken 
separately with GSL Assistant Director for UN Affairs 
Ekanayake.  Kadirgamar expressed interest in US views, but 
acknowledged he was not well briefed on the subject. 
Ekanayake said Sri Lanka realizes some action is needed, but 
that Iran and Sri Lanka have a close relationship (Iran is a 
major buyer of Sri Lankan tea).  President Kumaratunga will 
visit Iran in late November, around the same time as the IAEA 
Board meeting.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ambassador delivered reftel points and non-paper to 
Sri Lankan Foriegn Minister Kadirgamar during an October 29 
meeting. MFA Director General for Economic Affairs Prasad 
Kariyawasam also attended.  Kadirgamar listened with interest 
to US points and agreed to review the non-paper.  Kadirgamar 
said he needed "to become better briefed" on the issue.  In 
response to Ambassador's explanation of steps that had taken 
matters to this point, Kadirgamar asked whether North Korea 
was in a similar situation.  Ambassador replied that North 
Korea had withdrawn from the NPT and therefore did not view 
itself as under IAEA safeguards.  Iran, as an NPT signatory, 
must honor its NPT and IAEA commitments. 
 
¶3. (SBU) During the meeting, Kadirgamar requested additional 
background information on this specific issue, the EU 
discussions with Iran and nuclear fuel cycle issues in 
general.  Post will contact NP directly for additional 
information that we can provide. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In an earlier discussion with poloff, Sumedha 
Ekanayake, Assistant Director for UN Affairs, acknowledged 
that his government realizes that "something must be done" 
about Iran's nuclear activities.  This decision is 
complicated by the "close relations" his government maintains 
with Iran.  Ekanayake said his government has not yet decided 
what course of action to pursue. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: We understand from the Foreign Ministry 
that President Kumaratunga will travel to Iran, a major 
importer of Sri Lankan tea, in late November -- at about the 
time of the IAEA Board meeting.  Presumably the IAEA Board 
meeting will figure prominently in Iran's agenda for this 
trip.  Deputy Secretary Armitage will meet President 
Kumaratunga and Foreign Minister Kadirgamar on November 8. 
This would be an ideal time to raise the issue if Department 
believes a highest-level approach is warranted.
