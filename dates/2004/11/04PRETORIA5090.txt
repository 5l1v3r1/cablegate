¶3. (SBU) Action Request:  Please provide a formal response to 
the South African comments on our proposed R&D Agreement on 
Nuclear Material Safeguards Technologies in conjunction with 
a formal response to South African comments on our proposed 
R&D Agreement on Nuclear Energy Cooperation (per Ref B). 
Given the similarities in these two R&D agreements, our 
responses to both sets of South African comments need to be 
consistent.  We would note that the South African holiday 
season is upon us and that we would like to present U.S. 
responses to the South Africans no later than December 8, if 
possible.
