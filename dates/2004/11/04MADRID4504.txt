Deputy Director for International Financing Systems Mario 
Delgado Alfaro regarding Spain's forgiviving USD 482 million 
of Iraqi Paris Club debt.  This equals 80% of the total USD 
602 million Iraqi debt held by Spain.  Delgado emphasized

Iraq and the Paris Club creditors.  He chided the articles in 
the Spanish press that indicate this was a bilateral Spanish 
decision motivated by American pressure.  The official
