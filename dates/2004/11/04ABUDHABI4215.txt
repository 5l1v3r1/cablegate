¶1. (U) On November 23, the UAE deported Sudanese opposition 
figure Abdul Aziz Khalid Osman on the basis of an Interpol 
Red Notice from Sudan.  Osman is wanted by Sudan for alleged 
sabotage against Sudanese oil installations in 1999.  Osman 
is the former head of the Sudanese Alliance Forces, one of 
the military elements of the National Democratic Alliance 
(NDA), a group that has been working since 1995 to overthrow 
the regime of President Omar Al Bashir.  In June 2000, Bashir 
issued an amnesty for acts of sabotage inside and outside of 
Sudan, however, the amnesty was conditional on individuals 
returning to Sudan.  Osman, who lives in Cairo, was arrested 
on September 23 at Abu Dhabi airport on the basis of an 
Interpol Red Notice and turned over to the state prosecutor. 
Our sources indicated that he was turned over over to 
Sudanese authorities and boarded a direct flight to Sudan on 
November 23. 
 
¶2. (U) Human Rights Watch wrote UAE President Sheikh Khalifa 
bin Zayed asking for Osman,s immediate release.  Human 
Rights Watch said that the Sudanese government,s extradition 
request was &a politically motivated attempt to deny8 
Osman,s right to free expression, association and movement. 
According to Human Rights Watch, Osman had traveled to the 
UAE to give lectures and hold meetings.  The NGO said the 
NDA, based in Eritrea, is now inactive. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Osman,s case came to Post,s attention in 
mid-October when his Amcit daughter and wife wrote to the 
Ambassador appealing for USG intervention with the UAEG. 
Although Osman is not a U.S. citizen, our Consul has met with 
the UAE Attorney General and made regular inquiries on behalf 
of the Amcit family regarding Osman,s well-being while he 
has been in custody.  We have also kept the CA/OCS, AF/RSA, 
AF/SE, NEA/ARPI, and Embassies Khartoum and Asmara, informed 
about the status of his case.  While media reports that this 
case was handled by the public prosecutor, we understand that 
the Ministry of Interior weighed in strongly regarding the 
final decision on this case, citing the UAEG's international 
obligation associated with the underlying Interpol Notice. 
 
¶4. (U) Khartoum minimize considered.
