MISSION IN IRAQ; HAS SUGGESTIONS FOR MANDATE

Guidance Request - see para 3. 
 
¶1. (U) MFA OSCE Office Director Fabio Cristiani told poloff 
that an OSCE election observer mission for Iraq as proposed 
reftel was in line with Italy's view that the organization's 
expertise should be exploited for "out of theater" missions. 
He agreed that ODIHR could provide invaluable assistance to 
the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq (IECI) in the 
run-up to the elections, and help draft "lessons learned" for 
future elections. 
 
¶2. (U)  Cristiani also noted that given the security 
conditions, such a mission would not follow standard ODIHR 
procedures, i.e. a small long-term advisory team followed by 
a larger short-term observer contingent throughout the 
country, culminating in a statement on whether or not the 
elections were "free and fair" and/or represented the will of 
the voters.  He suggested therefore that the effort not be 
dubbed a "monitoring mission" but rather a "technical" or 
"advisory" mission to the IECI.  Such distinctions would be 
necessary to dampen any expectation that OSCE would be able 
to comment on the election results countrywide, and to 
protect the integrity of future ODIHR efforts.  Cristiani 
said that the mandate must therefore be drafted carefully and 
be clear in its limitations.  Italy was ready to assist this 
effort. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Cristiani also said Italy would be interested in 
seconding personnel to an OSCE Iraq election team, but still 
faces internal bureaucratic hurdles described ref b, which 
preclude the MFA from distributing funds directly to 
observers.  Cristiani asked if the USG would intervene on 
Italy's behalf with ODIHR officials to encourage them to take 
on the simple task of a one-time per diem distribution to its 
observers.  Post requests Department's instructions on a 
response to Cristiani.
