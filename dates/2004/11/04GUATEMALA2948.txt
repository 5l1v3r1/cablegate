(C) Polcouns delivered reftel demarche to Guatemalan Acting 
FM Marta Altolaguirre, who agreed wholeheartedly with U.S. 
assessment.  She said Guatemala's troop contribution to 
MINUSTAH was just one indicator of Guatemala's commitment to 
the "long-term efforts" that would be required of the 
international community in Haiti.  Altolaguirre volunteered 
that her personal view was that Aristide had been a 
"disaster" and could play no useful role in Haiti's future. 
She said she would forward to Guatemala's delegation to the 
Ibero-American Summit, already in San Jose, our concerns 
about Haiti and the need to express support for Latortue and 
the Interim Government of Haiti.
