(SBU) On November 9, EconOff delivered points on the 
resolution to ban human cloning before the Sixth Committee 
(Ref A) to Ghassan Shaikho, MFA Director of International 
Organizations.  Shaikho noted Saudi Arabia's support for the 
Costa Rican resolution and indicated that he expected Bahrain 
would follow the SAG lead (Ref B) and vote in favor of the 
resolution as currently drafted.  He did not clarify whether 
the GOB had received a fatwa from Bahrain's Ministry of 
Islamic Affairs (Ref C) that would help the GOB justify its 
position.
