SUBJECT: DUTCH PARLIAMENT REITERATES OPPOSITION TO LIFTING 
CHINA ARMS EMBARGO 
 
 
¶1. (U) At a regular hearing in the Dutch parliament on 
November 18 prior to the monthly EU foreign ministers' 
meeting (GAERC), spokesmen for the main political parties 
reiterated their opposition to the lifting of the EU's China 
arms embargo.  Encouraged by the recent vote in the European 
Parliament and reports of Swedish and Danish opposition, 
they urged the government to lobby in the EU for maintaining 
the embargo.  Parliament previously adopted a unanimous 
resolution voicing the same request.  Nevertheless, FM Bot 
made clear at the time that the government would not block a 
consensus to lift the embargo.  After the November 18 
hearing, State Secretary for European Affairs Atzo Nicolai 
reportedly said that the government would take parliament's 
views into account in dealing with this issue. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment:  Unlike in some other EU member states, 
the Dutch parliament's unanimous opposition to lifting the 
China Arms Embargo has little practical impact on the Dutch 
government's ability to form and implement policy on this 
issue.  While opposition to lifting the Embargo is broad, it 
is not particularly deep, and there is little enthusiasm for 
forcing a rift in the EU on the issue.  Most parliamentary 
leaders have already indicated that they accept the 
government's argument that, as EU president, the Netherlands 
should act in accordance with EU consensus.    End comment.
