¶1. MONUC HAS AGREED TO PUT A UN AIRCRAFT AT THE DISPOSAL OF 
CODEL WOLF BEGINNING JANUARY 8 IN KINSHASA. ACCORDING TO THE 
CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER OF MONUC, A TWIN-ENGINE AIRCRAFT 
WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE CODEL FOR THE TIME THEY ARE IN 
THE CONGO (DRC). SPECIFICALLY, THE AIRCRAFT WILL TAKE THE 
CONGRESSMAN WOLF AND HIS DELEGATION FROM KINSHASA TO GOMA, 
AND ON TO BUKAVU BEFORE RETURNING TO GOMA. 
 
 
¶2. EMBASSIES KINSHASA AND KIGALI WOULD THEN COORDINATE TO 
ARRANGE FOR CODEL'S WOLF'S TRANSPORTATION TO THE NEARBY 
RWANDAN TOWN OF GISENYI FOR ONWARD TRAVEL TO KIGALI, 
 
 
¶3. THE MONUC ADMINISTRATOR SAID THAT DUE TO LOGISTICAL 
CONSIDERATIONS, IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR MONUC TO 
PROVIDE AN AIRCRAFT SPECIFICALLY FOR CODEL WOLF STARTING FROM 
GOMA. HE THEREFORE SUGGESTED THE KINSHASA VENUE AS THE MOST 
FEASIBLE. 
 
 
¶4. IN ADDITION, IN A DECEMBER 29 MEETING WITH AMBASSADOR 
SWING, PRESIDENT KABILA AGREED TO THE AMBASSADOR'S REQUEST TO 
MEET WITH CONGRESSMAN WOLF AND HIS PARTY ON MONDAY, JANUARY 8 
IN KINSHASA WHERE HE EXPECTS TO BE, AT THIS TIME. 
 
 
¶5. CODEL WOLF MAY WISH TO ARRIVE IN KINSHASA AT 2200, SUNDAY, 
JANUARY 7, ABOARD SABENA FLIGHT SN 759 FROM BRUSSLES.
