¶1.  (C) WE SHARED REFTEL POINTS JUNE 5 WITH ROELAND VAN DE 
GEER, A/S EQUIVALENT FOR THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE IN THE MFA. 
VAN DE GEER EXPRESSED SOME FRUSTRATION THAT THE EU HAD NOT 
YET ISSUED A STATEMENT SINCE THE SECOND ROUND OF PERUVIAN 
ELECTIONS.  HE SAID THE DUTCH PUSHED FOR A STRONG EU 
STATEMENT CRITICISING THE ELECTION PROCESS EARLY IN THE WEEK 
OF MAY 28, BUT WERE REBUFFED BY THE PORTUGUESE PRESIDENCY. 
THE PRESIDENCY HAD ARGUED THAT THE EU SHOULD WAIT UNTIL THE 
OAS MEETING IN WINDSOR HAD BEEN CONCLUDED. 
 
 
¶2.  (C) VAN DE GEER SAID THE DUTCH WOULD BE LOOKING TO THE 
RESULTS OF THE OAS MEETING, AND,  DEPENDING ON THE OUTCOME, 
WOULD DECIDE THE BEST WAY TO EXPRESS THEIR CONCERNS.
