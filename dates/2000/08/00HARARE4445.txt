SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT: OFFICIAL MEDIA SPIN SADC SUMMIT 
DECLARATION ON ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY ACT 
 
 
¶1.  GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE-CONTROLLED MEDIA, THE HERALD 
    NEWSPAPER AND THE ZIMBABWE BROADCASTING CORPORATION 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        HARARE  04445  091251Z 
    (ZBC), ARE SPINNING THE RESULTS OF THE JUST-ENDED 
    SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY (SADC) SUMMIT IN 
    WINDHOEK.  THE ANGLE TAKEN BY BOTH MEDIA OUTLETS GIVES 
    PROMINENCE TO SADC CONDEMNATION OF THE ZIMBABWE 
    DEMOCRACY ACT (ZDA).  GOVERNMENT MEDIA ALSO REPORT THAT 
    SADC LEADERS GAVE UNEQUIVOCAL SUPPORT TO ZIMBABWE'S 
    LAND REFORM PROGRAM. 
¶2.  ZBC TELEVISION AND RADIO LED THEIR AUGUST 8 PRIME-TIME 
    NEWSCASTS WITH STATEMENTS BY NEWS READERS THAT THE 
    SUMMIT "CONDEMNED" THE ZDA, PASSED BY THE SENATE IN 
    JUNE AND CURRENTLY AWAITING HOUSE ACTION.  A VIDEO 
    REPORT BY THE ZBC REPORTER IN WINDHOEK MADE CLEAR, 
    HOWEVER, THAT SADC'S CONCERN OVER THE ZDA WAS NOT AT 
    THE TOP OF THE SUMMIT AGENDA.  OF THE ROUGHLY 3-MINUTE 
    VIDEO OF SADC SPOKESMAN RAMSAMY READING THE SUMMIT 
    DECLARATION, ONLY ABOUT 10 SECONDS WAS RELATED TO THE 
    ZDA.  THE VIDEO WAS EDITED TO GIVE RAMSAMY'S STATEMENT 
    ON ZDA GREATER PROMINENCE. 
¶3.  THE AUGUST 9 EDITION OF THE GOVERNMENT-OWNED "HERALD" 
    DAILY NEWSPAPER GAVE PROMINENT PAGE-ONE COVERAGE TO THE 
    SADC SUMMIT STATEMENTS ON LAND REFORM AND THE ZDA. 
    HEADLINED "SADC LEADERS BACK LAND PROGRAMME," THE SUB- 
    HEAD READ "BRITAIN CALLED UPON TO HONOUR OBLIGATIONS -- 
    SUMMIT CONDEMNS US CONGRESS BILL." THE ARTICLE GAVE THE 
    APPEARANCE THAT THE SADC SUMMIT CONCERNED ITSELF ONLY 
    WITH THESE TWO ISSUES.  NO OTHER SADC BUSINESS WAS 
    MENTIONED IN THE ARTICLE.  THE ARTICLE EXCERPTED THE 
    SECTIONS OF THE SUMMIT DECLARATION DEALING WITH LAND 
    REFORM AND THE ZDA, AND DREW ON STATEMENTS FROM UNNAMED 
    "SADC LEADERS." 
¶4.  ZIMBABWEANS WHO RELY ONLY ON GOVERNMENT MEDIA FOR THEIR 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HARARE  04445  091251Z 
    NEWS (A DWINDLING NUMBER OF PEOPLE) WOULD COME TO THE 
    CONCLUSION THAT THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THE SADC SUMMIT 
    WAS TO SLAM THE UK FOR ITS FAILURE TO SUPPORT 
    ZIMBABWE'S VERSION OF LAND REFORM AND BERATE THE US FOR 
    CONSIDERING CONDITIONAL ASSISTANCE TO ZIMBABWE.
