(SBU) Charge raised reftel points regarding the Government of 
Ecuador's potentially recognizing the Georgian separatist regions 
of Abkhazia and South Ossettia with MFA UnderSecretary for the 
Americas Ambassador Javier Leon January 25.   Leon said he planned 
to travel to Ecuador this week for a UNASUR meeting of Vice 
Ministers of Defense, and would raise the issue with his GOE 
counterparts at that time.  Separately Pol/C gave the contact data 
of Georgian MFA officials, contained in reftel, to MFA U.S. desk 
officer Rolando Ruiz Rosas.
