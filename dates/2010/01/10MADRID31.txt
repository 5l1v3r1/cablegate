TARGET CONSENSUS 
 
REF: SECSTATE 03080 
 
¶1. As the newly arrived Ambassador is still making 
introductory calls, Post engaged at working level to quickly 
convey the message on climate change.  Econoff delivered the 
demarche to Deputy Director General for Climate Change 
Affairs Paz Valiente and Deputy Director General for 
Emissions Trading and Flexibility Mechanisms Ismael Aznar 
Cano, both in the Ministry of the Environment and Rural and 
Marine Affairs.  They confirmed that the EU believes it is 
important to show broad support for the Copenhagen Accord. 
The Permanent Representatives of the EU discussed emissions 
targets and associating with the Accord during a meeting in 
Brussels on Wednesday, January 13.  There is broad consensus 
on associating with the Accord, but EU member states are 
still working out the technical matter of whether to 
associate jointly or individually by country. 
 
¶2. Aznar said that the more important issue, currently being 
discussed at the Ministerial meeting in Seville (January 
14-17), is the emissions target.  He said that it is likely 
to be the 20% target initially proposed, since the 30% figure 
presented during the Copenhagen discussions was contingent on 
commitments by other developed countries and major emitters. 
Aznar added that it would be difficult to take revised 
commitments by non-EU countries into consideration at this 
point given the January 31 deadline.  However, he indicated 
that a target above 20% was within the realm of 
possibilities.  The Ambassador will reiterate demarche 
talking points as appropriate in his introductory calls.
