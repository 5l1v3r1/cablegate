¶1. (SBU) Summary: Shanghai Municipal leaders stressed the 
importance of the upcoming Shanghai 2010 World Expo during 
meetings with CODEL Murray on January 15.  Security concerns 
related to the event remain a top priority for the municipal 
government.  End Summary. 
 
 
 
World Expo the Big Ticket in 2010 
 
--------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Shanghai Municipal Communist Party Secretary Yu 
Zhengsheng warmly welcomed Senator Murray and the other members 
of her delegation January 15. Yu said the Shanghai World Expo 
2010 is the most important item on the Shanghai Municipal 
Government's agenda for the year.  He stated that unlike Beijing 
during the 2008 Olympics, Shanghai would adopt a "more open 
attitude" towards Expo attendees.  (Note:  It was not 
immediately clear what Yu meant by either his comparison to the 
Beijing Olympics or what a "more open attitude" entails on the 
security side.  End Note.)  The Shanghai Municipal Government 
predicts there will be 70 million visitors to the Expo, and Yu 
said 18 million Expo tickets already have been sold. 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Yu expressed his "heartfelt appreciation" for Secretary 
of State Clinton's leadership to secure support and funding for 
the U.S. Pavilion at the Shanghai 2010 World Expo.  He expressed 
to Senator Murray his expectation that the U.S. Pavilion will be 
one of the most successful pavilions at the Expo. 
 
 
 
Expo Security Challenges are Paramount 
 
-------------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) Yu said the high number of Expo visitors will pose a 
"real security challenge."  Concerns range from fire safety on 
the Expo construction site to security checks for visitors after 
the Expo opens on May 1.  Several subway stations near the Expo 
site also will implement new security checks, Yu said.  He added 
that the attempt by an alleged terrorist to detonate explosives 
concealed in his clothing while on a flight from Amsterdam to 
Detroit caused government officials to ask if additional 
precautions should be taken at Shanghai airports. 
 
 
 
Hoping for USG Visitors to the Expo 
 
----------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶5. During a lunch meeting on January 15, Shanghai Municipal 
People's Congress (SMPC) Vice Chairman Hu Wei also raised Expo 
security.  According to Hu, Shanghai is waiting for additional 
funding from the Central Government for Expo security, 
indicating that security costs are likely to exceed initial 
projections. 
 
 
 
¶6. (SBU) SMPC Vice Chairman Hu extended an invitation to Senator 
Murray to return for the Expo.  He noted that Shanghai receives 
many visits from foreign government leaders and is ready to 
receive more for the Expo.  He also believes many U.S. citizens 
will come to Shanghai to visit the Expo.  He added that 
accommodation for Expo visitors will be provided for by Shanghai 
residents as well as hotels in Shanghai and nearby cities.

Senator Murray thanked Hu for the warm welcome to Shanghai and 
also noted that many more members of Congress would like to come 
and visit the Expo.
