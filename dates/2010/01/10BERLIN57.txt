SUBJECT: RESPONSE TO REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ON 
FORCED LABOR AND CHILD LABOR IN THE PRODUCTION OF 
GOODS 
 
REF: STATE 131995 
 
There is no indication that forced labor or 
exploitative child labor is used in the 
production of goods in Germany.  According to our 
contacts in the Federal Labor Ministry and the 
ILO's Germany office, involuntary child labor in 
the production of goods is not a problem in 
Germany.  Children and teenagers are protected by 
the Young Persons Protection of Employment Act 
(Jugendarbeitsschutzgesetz -JArbSchG).  Pursuant 
to Sec. 5 of the Act, however, young persons who 
want to work may, under certain restrictions, 
take "easy jobs" such as delivering newspapers 
from the age of 14 as long as they only work for 
a limited number of hours.
