¶1. (U) SUMMARY: U.S. Embassy Kingston ranks amongst the top 10 
posts worldwide in terms of volume for H-2B applicants.  Kingston 
also ranks within the top 10 posts worldwide for fraud activity. 
In an effort to reach out to local employment agents, and combat 
fraud, Kingston's Fraud Prevention Unit (FPU) paired with the 
Jamaican Ministry of Labor to host a workshop on important 
employment-based consular issues, namely H-2B visas, J-1 visas, and 
the Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Act.

 Workshop Gets Permanent Secretary's Attention

¶2. (U) On January 14, Kingston FPU, accompanied by the Nonimmigrant 
Visa Chief, visited the Ministry of Labor to present information to 
registered Jamaican employment agents.  The workshop attracted 
about 80 participants, notably including the Permanent Secretary of 
the Ministry of Labor and Social Security, Alvin McIntosh, who 
welcomed the group and attended the majority of the presentations. 
Agents, who arrange for Jamaicans to obtain H-2B and J-1 employment 
in the U.S., traveled from throughout Jamaica with two agents 
flying down from their offices in the U.S. in order to participate. 
One agent who had flown down from Maine noted that the workshop was 
well worth the flight.  The purpose of the workshop was to inform 
the agents of visa processes and requirements and to allow 
networking among agents and with the U.S. Embassy staff.  The 
presentations included information about visa interviews and 
appointments, the H-2B petition process, the H-2B Final Rule, J-1 
summer work and travel visa requirements, and the Wilberforce 
Trafficking Victims Act.

Securing Cooperation on Wilberforce Education and Enforcement

¶3. (U) This workshop was well-targeted; registered agents are the 
intermediaries between Jamaicans and U.S. employers, and are in the 
position to best assist the U.S. Embassy with disseminating 
information on visas and workers' rights.  A significant portion of 
this workshop focused on education about the Wilberforce Act, and 
the rights of H-2B and J-1 workers.  In the vein of cooperation and 
improvement, the agents agreed to review, share, and promote 
awareness of visa issues, specifically the Wilberforce Trafficking 
Victims Act, with their clients.

 Interactive Presentations Encouraged Discussions

¶4. (U) Throughout the presentations, Emboffs encouraged questions 
and comments from the audience, which led to meaningful discussions 
and promises for future cooperation and information sharing. 
Specifically, the open style of presentation allowed agents to 
candidly discuss adjudication procedures for H-2B applicants, who 
had numerous extensions, as well as current fee regulations.  Also, 
agents volunteered information about fees charged for J-1 
applicants and frustrations with the quality of some U.S.-based J-1

summer work and travel sponsors.  (Comment: The J-1 summer work and 
travel program is an excellent exchange program between the U.S. 
and Jamaica; in 2009 approximately 4,000 Jamaicans participated 
and, according to validation study results, the vast majority 
travel well on their visas.  Reftel 09 Kingston 1142.  End 
Comment.)  Lastly, agents were forthcoming about the extent of 
their services, and shared their own best practices with Emboffs 
and their colleagues. 
 
 
 
¶5. (U) In order to assist Kingston FPU with identifying and 
cataloguing agents, all agents agreed to email the embassy with 
their contact information, lists of their current employees (who 
may visit the embassy to drop off applications), and information 
about their fees and services.

Agents Complimentary of Embassy Procedures 
 
 --------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
 
 
¶6. (U) Emboffs were encouraged by compliments from the agents 
regarding the new appointment system and current H-2B procedures. 
Several participants advised that they had been registered agents 
for five to ten years and noted that the appointment system, in 
particular, greatly improved the application process.  Agents 
appreciate the group appointment system, which helps streamline 
their efforts, as well as the ability to drop off H-2B applications 
the day before interviews.  Emboffs offered to continue to build on 
our partnership with the Ministry of Labor to ensure that 
registered agents are aware of any upcoming changes to procedures 
or visa regulations. 
 
 
 
¶7. (U) CONCLUSION: The H-2B, J-1, and Wilberforce workshop jointly 
hosted by Kingston FPU and the Jamaican Ministry of Labor was a 
great success.  The workshop allowed Emboffs to present valuable 
information on visa processing, while also encouraging greater 
cooperation and partnerships between the agents, the Ministry, and 
the embassy.  Kingston FPU is confident that this workshop will 
significantly advance our goals to reach our target audience for 
employment-related consular issues, visa procedures, and workers' 
rights.
