(SBU) In the course of the Ambassador's January 20 courtesy 
call, Presidential Chief of Staff Ahmed Ouederni cited 
science and technology (S&T) as an area in which the United 
States and Tunisia could deepen bilateral cooperation.  In 
reply, the Ambassador followed up on previous ministerial 
meetings (refs B-E) by noting that the 2004 U.S.-Tunisia S&T 
Agreement had yet to be ratified by the Government of 
Tunisia.  The Ambassador emphasized the importance of S&T 
cooperation as a component of the "new beginning" laid out in 
the President's Cairo speech and the Secretary's speech at 
the Forum for the Future in Marrakech.  Ouederni was 
apparently knowledgeable about the S&T Agreement but did not 
offer any reply.  On a related note, Ambassador raised the 
upcoming visit of Science Envoy Dr. Elias Zerhouni; Ouederni 
was familiar with Dr. Zerhouni and welcomed the visit.
