¶1.      (U)  A front-page article in the January 7th edition of 
the daily Royal Gazette quoted Chief Medical Officer Dr. John 
Cann, "There have been two deaths recorded in Bermudians with 
influenza, including one laboratory confirmed case of 2009 H1N1 
influenza."  However, it is unclear whether the Bermudian was 
resident on or off the island.  Dr. Cann's statement also noted 
that there have been 25 confirmed cases in Bermuda, up from 23 
since December 19, and that eleven persons suspected of having 
the virus have been hospitalized.  The Department of Health's 
official website has not been updated since December 19, when it 
reported no confirmed deaths on the Island attributed to the 
virus.
