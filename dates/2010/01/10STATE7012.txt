VIP TRAVEL 
---------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Representative James McGovern (D-MA) and a group 
from Lynn University visited the Hotel Montana January 23. 
Contrary to earlier indications, Senator John Kerry (D-MA), 
did not travel with the Lynn University group.  Senator Bill 
Nelson (D-FL) was scheduled to arrive January 23 with the non- 
profit Help Bring Hope for Haiti, Inc.  However, difficulties 
in arranging return transportation precluded the Senator from 
accompanying the non-profit.  (TF1/DHS e-mail, TF1/OFDA e- 
mail, Tampa Bay Tribune) 
 
SEARCH AND RESCUE (SAR) 
---------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  The Government of Haiti informed Ambassador Merten 
at 0054 EST January 23 that it has not ceased search and 
rescue operations.  At approximately 1630 EST, media reported 
a new live rescue in the capital.  Six SAR teams are in 
country, two at the Hotel Montana.  (TF1/Embassy Port-au-

¶4.  (SBU)  The UN estimates current fuel supplies will last 
until the port is rehabilitated to the point where it can 
receive fuel shipments.  (USAID SitRep#20) 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  JTF-H made adjustments to the aircraft arrival 
schedule allowing flights from Brazil, China, and Argentina to 
land January 23 even though they had not arranged landing 
slots.  JTF-H will revise the scheduling of aircraft to make 
the process more transparent.  An Air Force Brigadier General 
has assumed responsibility for coordinating all air activities 
supported by JTF-H.  (TF1/Interagency Conference Call)

HUMANITARIAN/SECURITY/INFRASTRUCTURE

¶13.  (SBU)  The port is still operating at 30 percent capacity 
(about 150 containers off-loaded in 24 hours) due to damage to 
the pier, but SOUTHCOM estimates the port's capacity will 
increase to 400 containers in the next 96 hours.  There are 14 
ships waiting to unload.  (TF1/Interagency Conference Call, 
USAID SitRep#20)
