SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: BRAZIL'S ROLE IN HAITI 
 
Gaseous Diplomacy 
 
Article in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (1-28) by Janio de Freitas 
states: "The solution to the provocation, supposedly diplomatic, 
had an even worse result. Trying to lessen the negative 
repercussions of the initiative to distribute food and water in 
front of U.S. troops.....some Americans were called to join the 
Brazilians in a new round of distribution.  The impromptu act 
provoked a run from desperate people.  And there was such tumult 
that Brazilian troops.....used pepper spray and tear gas to contain 
the crowd.  The idea [of distributing food] attributed to Foreign 
Minister Celso Amorim while passing through Haiti revisits improper 
and even irregular procedures for the Brazilian troops.  The 
function designated by the UN for Brazil is to provide security 
while working together with troops from other countries under the 
mandate of MINUSTAH."
