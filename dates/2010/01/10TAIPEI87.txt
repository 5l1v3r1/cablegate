SUBJECT: TAIWAN: RESPONSE TO CHILD LABOR AND FORCED LABOR 
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 
 
REF: STATE 131995 
 
1.(U) Summary: There were no reports in 2009 of a wide 
prevalence of goods being produced on Taiwan through the use 
of forced labor or child labor.  End Summary. 
 
Forced Labor Concentrated in Service Industry 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) In 2009, most of the 46 cases involving forced labor 
on Taiwan were concentrated among migrant workers in the 
service industries, including food service, elder care, or 
construction.  There was no clear evidence of a trend of 
forced labor in the production of certain goods on Taiwan. 
There were, however, isolated incidents of forced labor 
reported in the gravel and agricultural industries over the 
year.  The most widely reported methods of coercion or 
exploitation were confiscation of identity and travel 
documents, irregular immigration status, and deduction or 
non-payment of salaries. 
 
Demographics of Migrant Worker Population 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) In 2009, 10.25 million people were employed on 
Taiwan, excluding migrant workers.  Of the approximately 
350,000 migrant workers admitted to Taiwan in 2009, close to 
one-half worked in private households.  Among the remaining 
175,000 migrant workers, 94 percent worked in the 
manufacturing industry and were covered by the Labor 
Standards Law. 40 percent of migrant workers on Taiwan came 
from Indonesia, 22 percent from Vietnam, 20 percent from the 
Philippines, and 18 percent from Thailand.  One NGO confirmed 
that household caregivers and domestic workers on Taiwan 
remain the most vulnerable to exploitative labor practices. 
The majority of victims of forced labor practices reported in 
the local press worked in the service industries, e.g. food 
services or nursing homes. 
 
Statutory Prohibitions on Forced and Child Labor 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶4. (U) Taiwan has several statutes that prohibit forced and 
child labor, including the Human Trafficking Prevention Act, 
the Criminal Code, and the Labor Standards Law, which 
establishes basic labor protections including prohibitions on 
forced labor and restrictions on child labor in manufacturing 
and other sectors.
