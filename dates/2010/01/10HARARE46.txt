On the Political and Social Front 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  The Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC) on the constitution 
suspended the outreach phase of the constitutional review process 
citing disagreements over lack of funding and rapporteurs who should 
collect and collate public views. This month the teams were expected 
to begin their outreach efforts. The PSC is waiting for 
UNDP-promised funding for public outreach that will include per 
diems, fuel, and stipends for MPs as they canvass the country. The 
PSC pledged to resolve the emerging disagreements over rapporteurs. 
This appears to be a bump in the road; those involved believe the 
process will soon resume. 
 
¶3.  We've received several reports this week of soldiers, war 
veterans, and ZANU-PF officials calling rallies in villages in 
Manicaland and in the Mashonaland provinces where villagers and farm 
owners are told that they must vote for the Kariba draft or face 
renewed violence or loss of property; headmen have been told to get 
their constituents to vote for Kariba "or else." One MDC councilor 
told the press," We're telling our supporters not to attend any of 
these meetings. They shouldn't be afraid because if it means dying 
we all die together." 
 
¶4.  Members of Women and Men of Zimbabwe Arise (WOZA) marched to the 
Ministry of Education in Harare on Monday to hand over their report 
on the education system in Zimbabwe entitled Looking Back to Look 
Forward. The report covers recommendations and a list of demands 
that parents want addressed by the Minister of Education, Senator 
David Coltart. Police interrupted the peaceful demonstration, 
arresting three people, a woman and two men. One of the men, 
Andrisson Manyere, is an accredited journalist who was previously 
abducted and tortured by security agents in 2008; he was released 
later that day without charge. One woman was held in jail for two 
nights while police refused to assign an officer to her case. 
 
¶5.  Journalist Stanley Kwenda fled to South Africa this week after 
he was reportedly threatened with death by senior police officer 
Chief Superintendent Chrispen Makedenge. Kwenda published a story 
last week describing the suicide of Makedenge's wife who reportedly 
killed herself after suffering years of abuse and threats by her 
violent husband. Makedenge is feared among activists in Zimbabwe as 
he was involved in the 2008 abductions and torture of over a dozen 
Qhe was involved in the 2008 abductions and torture of over a dozen 
MDC and human rights activists. 
 
¶6.  On January 21 the Roy Bennett trial was again postponed to 
January 25 owing to indisposition of one of the two assessors who 
presides over the trial with Judge Chinembiri Bhunu. Judge Bhunu was 
expected to rule on whether the prosecution's key witness, Michael 
Peter Hitschmann, should be impeached and therefore liable to be 
cross examined by the prosecution. Bennett's lawyer, Beatrice 
Mtetwa, told us that the pace of the trial was too slow and remarked 
 
HARARE 00000046  002 OF 003 
 
 
that the adjournments were invariably longer than the court 
sittings. 
 
¶7.  Members of loosely-affiliated religious groups known as 
apostolic sects face arrests over their refusal on religious grounds 
to immunize their children against measles. On January 22, The 
Herald reported that in the last three months 51 children have died 
of measles because their apostolic parents refused to immunize them. 
Now the government has threatened to arrest those apostolics who 
refuse to immunize their children. Last year many apostolics 
succumbed to cholera after refusing to seek medical treatment. 
 
¶8.  Two MDC Councilors in Banket were arrested on Monday and 
released without charge the same day. Concilia Chinanzavana and 
Fanny Tembo were reportedly accused of kidnapping a ZANU-PF 
councilor during the 2008 elections. Both were kidnapped in late 
October 2008 and held by security agents and tortured for two months 
before appearing in Harare police custody in December 2008 and 
January 2009. MDC and human rights activists believe the arrests are 
meant to continue to intimidate them and MDC supporters in the 
area.

On the Economic and Business Front 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶9.  A month-long dry spell in most parts of the country is 
threatening agricultural production this year. The Zimbabwe Farmer's 
Union, which represents most small-scale farmers, says that its 
members have lost around 60 percent of their crops. As a result, 
Zimbabwe is facing potential massive food shortages this year with 
food crops already wilting in many parts of the country. Tobacco 
farmers have also been forced to reap their crop before maturity, 
thereby accepting poor yields rather than waiting and writing the 
crop off completely. More detailed crop assessments will be 
available in a few weeks. For now, experts tell us the 2010 maize 
harvest will be no better than 2009 and potentially somewhat lower. 
 
 
¶10.  The Grain Millers' Association of Zimbabwe (GMAZ) has advised 
government to lift an import ban on genetically modified grain in 
view of the looming drought-induced shortage. The chairman of GMAZ, 
who criticized a skewed government policy on GMOs that allows 
imported maize meal in the country but bars grain, wants the policy 
harmonized. 
 
¶11.  According to a report in the Financial Gazette, government 
revenue in December was US$20 million below target, casting doubt on 
the GOZ's US$1.4 billion revenue projection for 2010, especially in 
view of tax cuts in the 2010 Budget. The government proposes to 
reduce corporate tax from 30 percent to 25 percent, cut individual 
tax from 40 percent to 35 percent, and increase the list of imported 
products on zero-rated duty. These tax concessions will certainly 
result in a fall in revenue unless there is substantial economic 
growth. 
 
¶12.  At a workshop organized to consider export opportunities under 
the Economic Partnership Agreements with the European Union and 
Qthe Economic Partnership Agreements with the European Union and 
COMESA trade protocols, the vice president of the Confederation of 
Zimbabwe Industries urged firms to improve competitiveness ahead of 
the 2013 deadline when 45 percent of goods from the EU will enter 
Zimbabwe duty-free. While acknowledging that local industry operated 
under very harsh conditions in the past that made it difficult to be 
efficient, he urged companies to increase efficiencies by cutting 
costs and improving product quality.

¶13.  "ZANU-PF wants to take the country back to 2008. Their reason 
is that they are clear in their minds that any process that may lead 
to elections is against them because they cannot win any election in 
the foreseeable future. They will scuttle the constitution, delay or 
totally derail the talks, block the land audit while physically 
bringing back violence out in the countryside." -- Unnamed Senior 
MDC Official, speaking to The Zimbabwe Independent, January 22, 
¶2010.
