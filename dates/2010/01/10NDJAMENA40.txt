JANUARY 31 COPENHAGEN ACCORD DEADLINE 
 
REF: STATE 3080 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  DCM and Democracy/Development Officer met January 
21 with Sandjima Dounia, Secretary General of the Chadian 
Ministry of Environment, to deliver points in reftel on the 
desirability of Chad's associating itself with the Copenhagen 
Accord on climate change.  Sandjima made clear that Chad 
"looked forward to signing up" (tient a s'inscrire) to the 
Accord with the UNFCCC Secretariat, but he did not make 
promises that this would be done by the January 31 deadline. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Sandjima recalled that Chad was enormously 
concerned about environmental degradation.  For this reason, 
it had sent a very large delegation to Copenhagen, including 
not only President Deby and reps of the Prime Minister's 
office, but also the Ministers of Environment, Energy, 
Planning and Foreign Affairs, along with many others. 
President Deby's intervention had focused on the 
disappearance of Lake Chad, the effects of deforestation and 
desertification on the nation, and climate change.  Chad had 
a national plan containing descriptions of projects necessary 
to address these problems, and it sought financial assistance 
from international partners with specific projects. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Sandjima stressed that "the world would be at 
risk" unless the international community coordinated its 
response to climate change.  We noted that significant new 
funding mechanisms would be available, provided that the 
Copenhagen Accords were adopted on schedule.  We also 
indicated, per reftel, that the most vulnerable countries, 
which might well include Chad, would be prioritized for 
assistance.  Sandjima invited us to look at the projects in 
Chad's national plan with a view to offering advice on 
funding mechanisms for them. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Chad's proposed projects, described in the 
National Program for Adaptation to Climate change, include a 
priority listing and presentation of ten projects totaling 
$14.2 million.  As s the case with other African states 
located jus south of the Sahara and the semi-arid region 
knwn as the Sahel, Cha has suffered some of the most 
dramatic effects of climate change in terms of rduced 
rainfall and concomitant reduction in amouts of surface 
water.  The highest-rnking project in Chad's national 
program focuses on maximizing the use of remaining surface 
and subsurface water resources.  The national plan also 
places a high priority on developing crop varieties that are 
better suited to current climate patterns, preservation of 
soil fertility, development of pasture and animal feed 
reserves for the segment of the population dependent on 
livestock, and capacity-building for government offices 
responsible for climate prediction.
