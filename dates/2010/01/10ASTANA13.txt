¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  On recent visits to Kostanai and North 
Kazakhstan Oblasts, PolOff visited American corners in Kostanai and 
Petropavlovsk.  Local residents claimed their regions are "the most 
peaceful in Kazakhstan," and expressed optimism about their regions' 
futures, although infrastructure, especially in Petropavlovsk, 
appeared relatively unchanged since the Soviet era.  Local residents 
requested more opportunities to travel to the United States on 
scholarship and exchange programs.  They expressed concerns about 
Kazakhstan's relationship with China and the effect of possible WTO 
accession.  END SUMMARY. 
 
KOSTANAI TOUTS ITS CULTURAL LEGACY -- AND NEW INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Several of PolOff's interlocutors in Kostanai, including 
American Corner event participants, Oblast Akimat (regional 
administration) representative Tatyana Zueva, and the director of 
one of the largest NGOs in Kostanai, Igor Vassilenko, praised their 
"safe, livable, and dynamic" city.  Many residents, including Zueva 
and Vassilenko, noted with pride that they were born and raised in 
Kostanai.  Near the modern airport, a large billboard welcomed 
investment and featured Canadian, Chinese, Israeli, and Russian 
flags.  On the drive into town, Zueva pointed out several new 
residential districts and shopping malls.  The town's center boasted 
extensive holiday decorations, including an ice castle and several 
large, lighted "Christmas trees."  In spring, the Oblast purchases 
flowers from the nationwide conglomerate ZelenStroi to decorate the 
city and improve quality of life, Zueva said.  She praised the 
city's commitment to a "green environment," noting a city law that 
requires the planting of two trees for every tree cut down. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) "Kostanai has been known as a center of arts since Soviet 
times," Zueva asserted, proudly emphasizing the Oblast's 
preservation of many historic buildings, including those housing a 
modern art academy and philharmonic.  Zueva also led PolOff on a 
tour of the two-story, 600 square meter, government-subsidized 
local-artists gallery, which the Charge visited in May (ref B).  The 
first floor showcased works by well-known artists with Kostanai 
connections, the second exhibition room was devoted to young 
Kostanai artists, and a third gallery allowed Kostanai artist to 
exhibit works for sale.  Various other residents commented on the 
high value Kostanai residents place on art and culture. 
Representatives from the House of Friendship and NGO activists 
praised Post's May 2008 jazz event held in Kostanai, and urged the 
United States to support more cultural programming in Kostanai (ref 
B).  House of Friendship exhibits praised the accomplishments of 
Kostanai youth. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) At the same time, Kostanai Oblast's official 
representative, Tatyana Zueva, insisted on showcasing the city's 
modern development.  Zueva, a former music teacher and Soviet Young 
Pioneer leader, took PolOff to the newly constructed French House 
and two quirky restaurants, a faux castle and a trendy caf designed 
to look like a submarine.  The five-year-old castle restaurant was 
almost deserted during the week-day lunch hour, despite the fact 
that prices were approximately half those of an average Astana 
restaurant.  Young diners, on the other hand, filled the popular 
Nautilus cafe, where prices were 80% cheaper than in Astana. 
 
MORE SOVIET INFRASTRUCTURE IN PETROPAVLOVSK 
 
¶6.  (SBU) In contrast to the situation in wealthier Kostanai, the 
main airport in the neighboring North Kazakhstan Oblast was small, 
old, and dimly lit, with no mechanized baggage carousel.  In North 
Kazakhstan Oblast's capital city of Petropavlovsk, nondescript 
Soviet apartment complexes and administrative buildings filled the 
downtown, while traditional Siberian-style houses predominated in 
residential districts.  A few elaborately-carved ancient wooden 
houses lined the main street.  Unlike in Kazakhstan's large cities 
and new oil towns, large-scale new construction and skyscrapers were

conspicuously absent in Petropavlovsk, and PolOff's hotel felt 
distinctly Soviet.  The front-desk staff collected keys when guests 
left hotel premises, and large rooms were dimly lit.  The 
recently-remodeled sauna and swimming pool complex remained shabby. 
 
 
...BUT RESIDENTS PRAISE CITY FOR BEING SAFE AND QUIET 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Despite the lack of new buildings, local residents 
asserted their high satisfaction with Petropavlovsk's quality of 
life.  PolOff's first interlocutor, an ethnic-Kazakh taxi driver and 
long-time Petropavlovsk resident, said that "he would never want to 
live anywhere else," since the city is safe and calm.  The taxi 
driver's only complaint was occasional hoarding of gas at some 
stations in order to sell at peak prices.  Laura Temenova, a 
long-time, ethnic-Kazakh resident and manager of the Petropavlovsk 
American Corner, praised her "quiet and safe" city, but alleged that 
the heating was turned on several weeks late this year, causing many 
schoolchildren to become sick. 
 
RESIDENTS EAGER FOR EXCHANGES AND INTERESTED IN U.S. POLICIES 
 
¶8.  (SBU) At separate presentations at the American Corners in 
Kostanai and Petropavlovsk, PolOff answered questions from audiences 
that included over 50 North Kazakhstan and Kostanai State University 
students, several retirees, one journalist, and representatives from 
the regional administrations.  They asked PolOff about her 
impressions of Kazakhstan, the role of an Embassy, the 
foreign-service application process, and opportunities to study in 
the United States.  Of particular interest to the students was the 
economic crisis' affect on U.S. scholarship programs.  Residents did 
not hesitate to ask about international politics and U.S. policies, 
questioning PolOff about World War II memorials in Georgia, 
per-hectare grain yields, U.S. farm subsidies, Obama's Nobel Prize, 
U.S. policies towards Iraq and Afghanistan, and the October 
U.S.-Kazakhstan Energy Partnership meetings.  One participant 
further questioned the benefits of alternative energy cooperation 
for oil and gas-rich Kazakhstan.  A particularly active contributor, 
Marat Yermukanov, a journalist in his late 50s, who works for North 
Kazakhstan's "Severniy" newspaper, said his daughter had studied in 
the United States, and "returned with great impressions based on 
what she saw."  An ethnic Kazakh, Yermukanov expressed interest in 
U.S. journalism and concern about the decline of Kazakh language, 
the effect of the Iran-Israel conflict on Kazakhstan, the benefits 
of WTO accession, and the flooding of Kazakhstan's markets by cheap 
Chinese goods. 
 
¶9.  (SBU) After both sessions, PolOff answered individual questions 
from audience members.  A young North Kazakhstan Oblast 
representative, Samat Shakanov, asked for a list of companies 
interested in joint ventures, particularly in wheat-refining, meat 
production, bio-diesel, and bio-fuels.  At the same session, a local 
North Kazakhstan University graduate complained that he must pirate 
music and videos due to a lack of jobs in the region for educated 
young people. 
 
¶10.  (SBU) COMMENT:  North Kazakhstan and Kostanai Oblasts are 
stable regions with residents who are unafraid to speak their views. 
 However, the contrast between the Akimat representative, looking 
for cooperation to grow the local economy, and the self-proclaimed 
pirate, who expressed frustration at the lack of opportunity, 
demonstrates the challenges facing regional administrations.  END 
COMMENT.
