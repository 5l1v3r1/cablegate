Classified By: Ambassador Daniel M. Rooney.  Reasons 1.4(b/d). 
 
¶1. C) SUMMARY: The group charged with overseeing 
the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons in 
Ireland told us that weapons decommissioning 
has been accomplished to a great extent, but not 
completely.  Completing devolution of policing 
and justice remains crucial to the peace process; 
failure to do so could vindicate the violence of 
dissident splinter groups in the eyes of many. 
Continuing separation of the two communities in 
Northern Ireland and lack of economic opportunity 
also threatens further progress.  The possibility 
of traveling to the U.S. is a powerful "carrot" 
with which the U.S. can influence activists' 
behavior, according to our interlocutors.  We will 
continue to strengthen Irish resolve on urging the 
Northern Ireland parties to agree on devolution. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (C) On January 13 Ambassador Rooney met with General 
John de Chastelain, the Head of the Independent 
International Commission on Decommissioning in Northern 
Ireland, and co-Commissioners Andrew Sens, Brigadier Tauno 
Nieminen and Aaro Suonio. (STRICTLY PROTECT ALL FOUR.) De 
Chastelain said the Commission must start wrapping up its 
work, as its annual mandate expires on February 9 and will 
not be renewed.  The major paramilitary groups in Northern 
Ireland have all decommissioned their weapons, with the 
most recent having been the loyalist Ulster Defense 
Association (UDA), which decommissioned its weapons on 
January 6.  One splinter group within the UDA, the 
Southeast Antrim Brigade, has not decommissioned its 
weapons, however.  DeChastelain said the Southeast Antrim 
Brigade had indicated a desire to decommission, possibly 
even before the Commission's mandate expires, but was being 
held back by concerns regarding dissident elements within 
the group. 
 
¶3. (C) Sens said, while stressing the Commission's 
independence and commitment to "stay out of politics," that 
one concern of the loyalist groups is their desire to reap 
the same benefits from the decommissioning process as 
republican leaders have, including increased job 
opportunities and training, and the ability to travel to 
the U.S.  He commented that when Sinn Fein leader Gerry 
Adams received his first U.S. visa in 1994, it was a 
powerful message to the leaders of paramilitary groups to 
reform their behavior.  Loyalist groups are now vocalizing 
their desire to have this same benefit, although they 
realize they might not be eligible due to previous criminal 
and terrorism-related activities. 
 
¶4. (C) The Commissioners' assessment of the current state 
of play regarding the peace process was that great 
progress had been made and a return to widespread violence 
was 
unlikely but not impossible.  They said the most 
constructive role the USG and the Irish government could 
play would be to continue to make clear to the unionist 
side that devolution of policing and justice remains a 
necessary final step in the peace process.  If that step is 
not taken, they said, the mainstream republicans, 
particularly Sinn Fein, stand to lose credibility with 
their base, while the message of the republican dissidents, 
who advocate a return to terrorist violence, would be 
vindicated in the eyes of many frustrated grassroots 
nationalists.  At the same time, the Commissioners worried 
that Ireland and the UK are already discussing a Plan B to 
keep the peace process moving along if devolution fails. 
Both governments need to maintain resolve on devolution, 
they stressed. 
 
¶5. (C) The Commissioners stressed that continuing 
sectarianism and lack of economic opportunity remain two 
factors that endanger continuing progress toward stability 
in Northern Ireland.  They described the continued 
day-to-day separation between Catholics and Protestants, 
especially noticeable in separate schools, separate 
neighborhoods and separate sporting teams.  Lack of jobs or 
economic opportunity for young, uneducated and untrained 
men on both sides of the divide are the biggest potential 
threat to peace, all agreed.  All who are interested in 
consolidating the gains of recent years need to promote 
economic opportunity, job training and integration of the 
two communities, they said. 
 
¶6. (C) COMMENT:  The Commissioners' assessment of the 
current state of play, namely that a return to violence is 
unlikely but not impossible - and that completing 
devolution of policing and justice is necessary in order to 
avoid a complete impasse in the peace process - tracks with 
 
DUBLIN 00000013  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
what our Irish contacts report.  We will continue to 
strengthen Irish resolve on devolution to avoid a premature 
election of any Plan B.  END COMMENT. 
 
¶7. (C) NOTE:  The Commissioners stressed the importance of 
their independence and impartiality; please potect their 
confidentiality. END NOTE.
