¶1. (U) SUMMARY: Germany has increased humanitarian assistance 
to Haiti following the January 12 earthquake to 7.5 million 
euros.  Of this total, the Development Ministry (BMZ) is 
providing 2.5 million euros for food aid and the Foreign 
Ministry is contributing the remainder for emergency 
assistance, including search and rescue.  Germany is 
registering its contributions on the Financial Tracking 
System (FTS) of the UN Office for the Coordination of 
Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).  More assistance will be 
forthcoming pending a UN needs assessment.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) Econoff conveyed REF A and REF B points to contacts at 
the German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(BMZ) and Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA).  Kerstin 
Faehrmann, BMZ's Director for Emergency Aid and the World 
Food Program, said the German government had increased its 
humanitarian assistance for Haiti from the previously 
announced 1.5 million euros to a new total of 7.5 million 
euros.  BMZ's share of the total, 2.5 million euros, will go 
towards food aid, with 500,000 euros channeled via the German 
development implementing agency GTZ and 2 million euros via 
the World Food Program (WFP).  According to Faehrmann, 
Germany's 7.5 million euro contribution is part of the 400 
million euros pledged by the EU. 
 
¶3. (U) The Foreign Ministry is contributing the remaining 5 
million of the 7.5 million euro total towards immediate 
emergency aid.  The funds will be disbursed via German NGOs 
operating in Haiti and focus primarily on search and rescue, 
food aid, medicine, temporary shelter, and drinking water. 
The German Agency for Technical Relief (THW) has deployed a 
team of 4 experts in the fields of logistics, water, 
communications and construction.  A separate THW team has 
provided two water purification devices, which can supply 
drinking water for 60,000 people.  According to an MFA 
statement, the German Red Cross sent a mobile hospital to 
Port-au-Prince, and the German government will provide an 
additional mobile hospital.  The MFA is registering German 
government assistance on OCHA's Financial Tracking System 
(FTS).  Pending a needs assessment by the UN, more assistance 
will be forthcoming.  (REF C) 
 
¶4. (U) The MFA believes German citizens are among the dead 
and injured in Haiti, with 16 Germans still missing.  The 
MFA's regional doctor has traveled to Haiti (presumably to 
treat German victims).  The MFA is also sending additional 
personnel to staff the German Embassy in Port-au-Prince.
