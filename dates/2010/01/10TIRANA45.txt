¶1. (U) Ambassador Withers delivered reftel talking points 
to Foreign Minister/Deputy Prime Minister Ilir Meta.  Meta 
expressed his full support for our Afghanistan strategy and 
will stress the suggested points in his public remarks and 
in his participation at the January 28 London Conference. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The British Embassy in Tirana contacted Post to 
relay that they had received similar instructions and had 
been told to coordinate their demarche with the U.S. 
Embassy.  The U.K. Embassy was especially keen to urge the 
Government of Albania to contribute to the Reintegration 
Fund that will be presented at the London Conference.  The 
Ambassador mentioned the fund to Meta.  Meta noted that UK 
Foreign Minister David Miliband also called him January 20 
to urge Albanian support for the London Conference and the 
Fund.  Meta stated that the GOA would consider what it could 
contribute but had to be realistic about its capacities, 
given it is already contributing at levels that exceed its 
relative size compared to other contributors.
