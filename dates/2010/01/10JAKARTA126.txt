SUBJECT: ACTION REQUEST: A MULTILATERAL CLIMATE CENTER IN INDONESIA 
 
¶1. (SBU) Action Request: Post requests Washington concurrence to 
discuss with foreign missions resident in Jakarta and the GOI the 
possibility of multilateral participation in the proposed Jakarta 
component of the Asian Regional Center for Climate Change 
initiative.  The scheduled February 20-23 assessment visit could 
further explore how participation of other donor countries in the 
Jakarta ARC component could help multiply the impact that the center 
could bring to turning science into solutions for the whole range of 
mitigation and adaptation challenges.  If GOI and other partners 
agree to the Center concept in following weeks, the President could 
announce this new initiative during his upcoming visit. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On January 28, DCM Ted Osius discussed post-Copenhagen 
engagement with ambassadors and deputy ambassadors from resident 
missions of Australia, the EU, UK, the Netherlands and Norway, a 
group originally formed by Ambassador Hume in October 2009.  These 
mission representatives noted that their countries had climate funds 
for Indonesia, but lacked functional and coordinated mechanisms 
through which to spend those funds effectively.  Activities to date 
had been uncoordinated, isolated and disparate.  The solution, they 
agreed, would be a key group of supporting nations to jointly 
approach the GOI to work out coordinated arrangements of support for 
climate mitigation and adaptation actions. 
 
¶3. (SBU) This group is planning a follow on meeting with GOI to 
discuss coordination on climate change financing, on the ground 
projects and political engagement with the world.  They reported 
that the GOI sees the UNEP meeting in Bali this February 22 as a way 
to repair the trust lost in Copenhagen and to advance COP 16 in 
Mexico.  Post also notes that on January 25, Agung Laksono, 
Coordinating Minister for People's Welfare and Vice Chair of 
Indonesia's National Climate Change Council, and Climate Negotiator 
Rachmat Witoelar stated to the press on that Indonesia is working on 
establishing a climate center for Asia in Jakarta.  It appears that 
the desires of the GOI, major foreign donor nations, and the ARC 
concept are compatible and could form a strong regional climate 
change deliverable for POTUS to announce.
