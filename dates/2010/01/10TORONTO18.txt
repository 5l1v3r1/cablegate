SUBJECT: Ontario Moves Ahead With DRIC Construction Projects 
 
REF: 09 TORONTO 209 
 
¶1. (SBU) Following the December 3, 2009 approval of the federal 
environmental assessment by the GOC, Ontario moved ahead with the 
province's portion of the Detroit River International Crossing 
(DRIC) that will expand the busiest trade corridor between the 
United States and Canada.  On December 29, Infrastructure Ontario 
and the Ontario Ministry of Transportation (MTO) released a request 
for proposals (RFP) inviting companies short-listed to design, 
build, finance, and maintain the 7-mile-long border crossing access 
road to submit formal construction proposals.  There are no 
specific domestic content requirements.  However, successful teams 
had to demonstrate the ability to partner with local contractors. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In June 2009, Infrastructure Ontario and the Ontario 
Ministry of Transportation began pre-qualifying teams to design, 
build, finance and maintain The Windsor-Essex Parkway project.  The 
submission process for the Request for Qualifications (RFQ) was 
open to any firm, and the RFP bid process is limited to the three 
firms short-listed through the RFQ process.  The three finalists, 
Rose City Parkway Group, Windsor Essex Parkway Group, and 
Windsor-Essex Transportation Partners have roughly six months to 
prepare and submit their proposals. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The RFQ process ranked proposals from bidding firms based 
on their approach to partnering, design, construction, and 
maintenance, as well as their financing abilities to ensure 
completion of the project.  There were no restrictions on foreign 
content.  The successful team will be announced in late 2010. 
Initial construction of the Parkway began in December 2009 with the 
building of a new noise barrier and two bridges for the Parkway by 
a local contractor.  Full construction of the Parkway is scheduled 
to begin in 2011.
