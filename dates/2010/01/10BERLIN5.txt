¶1. (U) Per refs A and B, Econoff notified Dr. Udo Renner of 
the Technical University in Berlin (TU Berlin), TUBSAT-A 
Project Manager, of the January 10 collision risk posed by 
debris from the Russian COSMOS 2251 satellite.  Dr. Renner 
was very appreciative of the notification and was previously 
unaware of the collision risk.  He said that TUBSAT-A is 
almost 20 years old and inoperative, and was therefore not 
concerned about any resultant damage to the satellite.  Dr. 
Renner expressed interest in how this situation unfolds asked 
to be kept informed of future developments.  In addition to 
Dr. Renner, Econoff sent email notifications to Joachim von 
Marschall, MFA Head of Division for Research and Technology 
Policy, and Dr. Thorsten Nix, of the German Space Agency's 
(DLR) Office for International Cooperation. 
 
¶2. (U) Dr. Renner updated his contact information as follows

ABOUT TUBSAT-A 
-------------- 
 
¶3. (U) According to the NASA/JPL Mission and Spacecraft 
Library, the Technical University of Berlin Satellite A 
(TUBSAT-A) was the first micro-satellite (35 kg) built by the 
Institute for Aerospace (ILR) at the TU Berlin, and was used 
as a test platform for communications and attitude control 
systems.  TUBSAT-A was launched into low-earth orbit (LEO) on 
6/17/91 aboard an Ariane 4 rocket and has since ceased 
operation, according to Renner.  During its operational 
lifetime, the cube-shaped satellite was an important 
communications tool for Arctic and Antarctic expeditions. 
Since TUBSAT-A, ILR TU Berlin has launched five additional 
TUBSATs, of which four are still in active operation.
