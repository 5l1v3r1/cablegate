VIP TRAVEL 
---------- 
 
¶1. (SBU)  Pan American Health Organization Director Dr. Roses 
will travel to Haiti January 21.  (TF1/Interagency Conference 
Call) 
 
SEARCH AND RESCUE (SAR) 
---------------------- 

¶2.  (SBU)  Seventeen SAR teams continue operations in the field. 
Los Angeles County rescue workers made one rescue on January 20. 
To date, SAR teams have rescued over 122 people.  SAR teams also 
uncovered the bodies of two Americans from the Hotel Montana. 
(TF1/Interagency Conference Call) 
 
COMMODITY FLOW 
-------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Supplies are reaching primary distribution centers 
but are not effectively getting to secondary sites.  The biggest 
distribution bottleneck is vehicular traffic in Port-au-Prince. 
Improving distribution is a high priority for TF-Haiti.  The 
private sector is beginning to return, with some food markets 
and gas stations reopening.  Airport operations continue to 
increase, with 153 flights clearing the airport January 20. 
However, a backlog of flights continues due to high demand. 
Some aircraft have been turned around in-flight by air traffic 
control because of mismatched tail numbers or lack of detailed 
cargo manifests (flights are prioritized based on cargo).  All 
slots for large aircraft are booked through February 10.  There 
also continue to be delays caused by congestion on the ground. 
SOUTHCOM has invited the UN to coordinate on flight 
prioritization and scheduling.  SOUTHCOM is proposing the co- 
location of JTF-H with representatives from the UN, Government 
of Haiti, and USAID in the Humanitarian Assistance Coordination 
Center.  Under this arrangement, USAID will vet U.S. civilian 
flight requests and the UN will vet international flight 
requests.  To date, 25 percent of the flight slots allocated 
have gone to the international community.  (TF1/Interagency 
Conference Call, SOUTHCOM SitRep) 
 
EVACUATIONS/AMERICAN CITIZEN AND LE STAFF WHEREABOUTS 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  As of 0500 EST, approximately 400 Americans were 
inside the Embassy compound and an additional 200 were outside. 
There are 38 confirmed American fatalities and another 25 
reported, which remain unconfirmed.  On January 20, 927 people, 
including 772 Americans, were evacuated by air and bus. 
According to post, to date 7660 Americans have been evacuated 
from Haiti.  The arrival of passport reading machines and 
baggage screening equipment (donated by American Airlines) has 
expedited on-the-ground processing and improved security. 
Convoys continue to shuttle between Santo Domingo and Port-au- 
Prince.  A convoy with 88 Amcits arrived in Santo Domingo at 
0120 EST.  A DS-escorted convoy left Santo Domingo at 0300 EST 
with four passenger buses and a fuel truck.  Embassy Santo 
Domingo is planning on send four buses on January 21 and six on 
January 22.  (TF1/CA-TF, TF1/Embassy Port-au-Prince SitRep, 
TF1/Interagency Conference Call, TF1/CA e-mail) 
 
MEDICAL RESPONSE 
---------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  The Haitian Ministry of Health does not have the 
capacity to distribute supplies to hospitals.  A SOUTHCOM senior 
surgeon is taking inventory of the requirements at Haitian 
hospitals and will coordinate support with USAID.  The USNS 
Comfort is receiving patients from 10 hospital sites and has 
treated 237 patients.  (TF1/Interagency Conference Call, TF1/DOD 
SitRep) 
 
INTERNATIONAL COORDINATION/REQUESTS 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (U)  No updates at this time. 
 
DEPLOYMENT OF U.S. GOVERNMENT ASSETS 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶7.  (SBU)  The 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit began operations 
in Leogane, located nine miles west of Port-au-Prince.  (DOD 
SitRep) 
 
HUMANITARIAN/SECURITY/INFRASTRUCTURE 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶8.  (SBU)  There are no major changes to the overall security 
situation.  The GOH is getting more police on the street, 
including 50 of the 67 police assigned to Cite de Soleil.  A 
prison break in Les Cayes (400-500 inmates) and lack of pay for 
the police are adding to concerns about crime.  At current 
troops levels, MINUSTAH will not be able to keep pace with the 
growing demand for security.  Generals Fraser and Keen have 
agreed that U.S. support for MINUSTAH should be in place by 
January 22, pending completion of the Statement of Principles. 
In addition, Brazil has offered a battalion, and UNHQ noted that 
other countries are offering troops.  DOD delivered 43,000 
radios to Port-au-Prince for use by U.S. officials and other 
relief workers.  JTF-Haiti noted that the January 21 reopening 
of banks will be a test for security forces.  The port is 
operating at 30 percent capacity due to pier damage and 
insufficient logistical support on shore.  SOUTHCOM estimates 
three weeks will be needed to finish port repairs. 
Nevertheless, Dutch and French naval ships off-loaded cargo 
January 20.  Two USN ships will be next to unload.  The fuel 
pier should be operational by January 25.  (TF1/Interagency 
Conference Call, TF1/IO-USUN SitRep, DOD SitRep) 
 
POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS 
---------------------- 
 
¶9.  (SBU)  SOUTHCOM Commander General Fraser will brief Haiti 
relief issues, including flight coordination efforts, at the 
Pentagon Foreign Press Center at 1000 EST.  (TF1/DOD Public 
Affairs SitRep)
