SUBJECT: OSCE: STATEMENT ON RUSSIAN FEDERATION'S CALL FOR 
PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS IN THE NORTH 
CAUCASUS REGION 
 
Â¶1. Post is authorized to present the following statement at 
the January 28 Permanent Council meeting in Vienna. 
 
Begin text: 
 
Thank you, Mister Chairman. 
 
The United States and other delegations have repeatedly 
voiced concern here in the Permanent Council over the past 
year regarding the increased incidences of violence in 
Russia's North Caucasus region targeted against journalists, 
human rights defenders, government officials, and citizens. 
 
We agree with the European Union's statement today regarding 
the treatment of individuals in Russian police custody, which 
has recently led to abuses such as violence or neglect.  We, 
too, welcome initial steps taken to investigate these crimes, 
and we urge that any criminal misconduct revealed by these 
investigations be fully and transparently prosecuted.  Doing 
so, as the EU has noted, would further reflect Russia's 
dedication to fully implementing OSCE commitments. 
 
In that regard we note Russian Federation Prime Minister 
Putin's call on January 24 for the protection of human rights 
organizations in the North Caucasus, following a long period 
of violence against and dangers confronting human rights 
activists in this troubled region. We hope his expectation 
that regional and local authorities will work with law 
enforcement agencies to ensure the proper operation and 
functioning of human rights organizations and the safety of 
human rights defenders is a new sign of the government's 
determination to turn the deteriorating situation around and 
to take steps to end the apparent air of impunity that now 
prevails. 
 
It is time for those guilty of violence and murder to be 
brought to justice.  We support the Government of Russia, in 
keeping with Prime Minister Putin's statement, in its efforts 
to ensure that Russian civil society organizations will be 
able to fully participate without unnecessary hindrance in 
contributing solutions to societal challenges and in 
advancing rule of law. 
 
The United States welcomes this statement by the Russian 
Prime Minister as an acknowledgment by Russia of the 
importance of its OSCE commitments on fundamental freedoms 
and human rights, the protection of which will contribute to 
both internal and external security in a very volatile 
region.  It remains our hope that these words will soon be 
matched by results which will demonstrate the faithful 
implementation of OSCE commitments.
