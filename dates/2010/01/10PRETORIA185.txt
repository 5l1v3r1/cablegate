REF: STATE 073217 (09) 
 
¶1. (U) South Africa became an official member of the 
International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) on January 17, 
¶2010.  Elevating South Africa from observer country status, 
President Jacob Zuma authorized Minister of Energy Dipuo 
Peters to sign the statute enabling South Africa to 
participate as a full member of IRENA.  Minister Peters 
attended the third session of the organization's preparatory 
commission in Abu Dhabi on January 17, where IRENA's 2010 
work program, staffing, rules and budget were discussed. 
 
¶2. (U) On joining IRENA, Minister Peters said, "this is a 
pioneering development that will enable us to work with other 
countries to accelerate the introduction of renewable energy 
and to confront our vexing energy challenges". 
 
¶3.  (U) Richard Worthington, Climate Change Program Manager 
at the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) in South Africa 
welcomed the announcement, but also expressed the view that 
the South African government needed to do much more on 
renewable energy. 
 
¶4.  (U)  COMMENT: As described in reftel, the United States 
became a signatory of IRENA on June 29, 2009.  Renewable 
energy is an area of great potential for U.S. - South Africa 
bilateral cooperation and South Africa's decision to join 
IRENA is a step in the right direction. END COMMENT.
