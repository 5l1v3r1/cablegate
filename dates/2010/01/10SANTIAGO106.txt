"worrisome" to Chile, especially torture, the treatment of women

religious freedom, and death penalty for minor offenses, which 
Ateaga noted is sometimes used against activists.  Both Hertz and 
Ateaga agreed with the United States' plan to urge Iran to finalize 
the visit of a delegation from the Office of the High Commissioner 
for Human Rights.

Haiti, since Haiti would not be able to prepare for it.
