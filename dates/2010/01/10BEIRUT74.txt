GOVERNMENT REQUESTS U.S. ASSISTANCE IN SEARCH AND RESCUE, 
RECOVERY 
 
¶1.  The Lebanese government has requested immediate USG 
assistance in search and rescue and/or recovery operations 
following the crash of Ethiopian Airways flight 409 on 
January 25.  The plane, en route from Beirut to Addis Ababa, 
went down shortly after its 02:30 hrs (local) take-off 
approximately 4 km off the Lebanese coast about 15 km south 
of Beirut.  Debris and bodies are currently being recovered 
from the water and adjacent coastline.  Lebanese military 
officials estimate the depth of the water in the area where 
the plane went down to be 50-100 meters. 
 
¶2.  Mid-morning on January 25, the Lebanese Armed Forces 
passed to Embassy Beirut on behalf of the defense minister a 
request for the following:  "humanitarian assistance" in 
recovering the bodies from the flight; assistance in locating 
and recovering the plane's "black box"; and assistance in 
interpreting the data from the flight data recorder and 
cockpit voice recorder once they are recovered.  The Lebanese 
authorities specifically requested divers to assist in the 
recovery operations. 
 
¶3.  At noon on January 25, the Lebanese prime minister's 
office also requested the assistance of the NTSB and FAA in 
recovering and interpreting data from the plane's recorders. 
An official from the office stated that Prime Minister Hariri 
had already authorized reception of an NTSB/FAA team, and 
noted that Lebanon welcomed any help the U.S. could offer in 
the follow-up to the crash.  In a midday press conference, 
the prime minister said that Lebanon was requesting 
assistance from the U.S., UK, Cyprus and France. 
 
¶4.  Embassy Beirut recommends a favorable response to the 
Lebanese requests and stands ready to facilitate.
