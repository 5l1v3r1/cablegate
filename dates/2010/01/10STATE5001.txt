it will require 100 million prepared meals over the next 30 
days.  Major U.S. cell phone carriers will advance funds to 
the Red Cross to cover the $22 million in donations pledged 
for Haiti relief efforts via text, meaning funds will reach 
the organization within a week.  A 3.5 hour hold on all air 
traffic handled by the Port-Au-Prince air traffic control 
center began at 0200 EST on January 19 due to temporary 
airspace saturation.  The seaport at Port-Au-Prince should be 
at a minimal operating capacity by January 21.  (TF1/ Embassy
