What does "Strategic" mean? 
 
Op-ed in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (1-8) by columnist Eliane 
Catanhede writes: "...The question in place [at the moment] is 
whether the partnership between Brazil and France is enough to 
justify the purchase of the Rafale fighter plane.... The GOB seems 
to be divided between those who want to support the Air Force's 
report [which indicates preference for the Swedish jet] and the 
pro-French who support the Rafale at any cost and see only the 
political aspects.....In the end, what does 'strategic' really 
mean.  The alliance between the Sarkozy and Lula's Administrations 
or an Air Force package between two countries that will last for 
the next 30 years and will have industrial and technological 
impact?"
