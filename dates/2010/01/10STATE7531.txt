for post participation in the February 16 CIV-MIL ROC 
Drill in Doha, Qatar.  S/SRAP requests response by January 
27 identifying points of contact for each topic area and 
to finalize its recommended participants for review by 
Ambassador Holbrooke and General Petraeus.  S/SRAP will 
forward a consolidated list of non-military invitees to 
CENTCOM by January 29 which will include invited DC-based 
civilian, Embassy, Afghan, and international personnel. 
Details on logistics, conference schedule, and other 
logistical matters will be jointly addressed by S/SRAP and 
CENTCOM.  Post will have responsibility for drafting 
materials in close collaboration with ISAF, SRAP, and/or 
CENTCOM as applicable.  Ambassador Holbrooke may identify 
some topics areas which will be jointly presented with 
post personnel and invites post input.  END SUMMARY AND 
ACTION REQUEST. 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Logistics.  CENTCOM will coordinate all 
logistical support in Qatar for conference attendees. 
On-base transportation for senior personnel is available

participation, lodging, and access for all non-military 
personnel based in DC and Afghanistan.  Post is requested 
to coordinate all movement, visa, and country clearance 
support for all Afghanistan-based non-military invitees. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) S/SRAP agrees with the framework as outlined in 
paragraph 4 of KABUL216 which outlines two six-month turns 
over 19 substantive topic areas.  Presenters should have 
the most knowledge of the issues and can bestbe best able to 
explain what 
State is doing on the ground.  The requirement is not/not 
rank driven.  Presenters should be present at the full 
dress rehearsal on February 15th in Doha.  S/SRAP also 
concurs with the recommendation of not engaging President 
Karzai on the Doha Conference or extending invitations to 
Afghan officials until after the London Conference. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Post indicated that a small SRAP team will visit 
Kabul in early Feb to help coordinate.  S/SRAP concurs 
with this recommendation but is awaiting a timeframe from
