SUBJECT: Brazil Has Not Addressed Amcit Cases with Iran 
 
REF: 09 STATE 129480 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: Lisa Kubiske, Charge d'Affaires; REASON: 1.4(B), (D) 
 
¶1.  (C) The Government of Brazil has not discussed with the 
Government of Iran the cases of the six American citizens detained 
or missing in Iran.  Reftel was delivered to the Ministry of 
Foreign Relations (Itamaraty) Iran desk officer Roberto Salome 
(currently acting head of the Iran/Central Asia desk) on December 
28; he offered no immediate reply at that time. 
 
¶2.  (C) On January 5, Undersecretary for Political Affairs Vera 
Machado met with the Iranian Ambassador.  According to Salome, who 
attended the meeting and gave his readout to poloff on January 7, 
Machado pressed the Iranian Ambassador on treatment of the Baha'i, 
specifically the seven Iranian citizens who will be placed on trial 
on January 12.  The Iranian Ambassador told Machado that Iran has 
complete religious freedom, but that Baha'i is not a religion but 
rather a secret society implanted by the British during the 
colonial era, and that its followers are spies subject to judgment. 
The meeting ended shortly thereafter without discussion of other 
subjects.   Salome told poloff that Machado said to him on the way 
back, "They must think we're stupid." 
 
¶3.  (C) Salome said that the American citizen cases were not on the 
agenda because President Lula's office specifically instructed 
Itamaraty to request a meeting to discuss the Baha'i and the 
Iranian Embassy responded immediately.  When pressed, Salome said 
that Itamaraty had no problem delivering direct messages from the 
USG, such as about the detained and missing Amcits.  He seemed, 
however, to be missing direction from higher-ranking officers, many 
of whom are on vacation and will be reluctant to use their capital 
with the Iranian government on this issue.  Salome emphasized that 
the GOB believes that Iran should return the Amcits immediately, 
without attempting to link the cases to negotiations about Iran's 
nuclear program or other issues.  With more senior officials now 
beginning to return from leave, post will continue to raise the 
issue and report on any subsequent replies.
