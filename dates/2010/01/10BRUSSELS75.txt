¶1.  Emboff talked to Geert Vansintjan, Director of the Office 
of Humanitarian Aid, Food Aid and Rehabilition on January 21 
to thank him for Belgium's contributions to Haiti earthquake 
relief on January 20.  Belgium has contributed a "B-fast" 
team of up to 130 workers who focus on search and rescue 
assisted by dogs and operating a field hospital and a water 
purification unit (reftels).   Over the weekend of January 
15-16, the Embassy received a request from the Government of 
Belgium for U.S. military protection for the Belgian workers. 
 The Embassy passed the requests to the State Department 
operations center and ensured that security was provided as 
requested.  According to Vansintjan, the B-Fast team is 
likely to stay in Haiti longer than foreseen.  He described 
the Haiti situation as the "biggest crisis Belgium has 
confronted since B-Fast was set up."  The field hospital is 
to be extended and combined with a Red Cross hospital 
operated by Germans. 
 
¶2.  The arrival of the B-Fast team was coordinated through 
the UN's OCHA and to some extent its operations are being 
coordinated with U.S. forces on the ground in Haiti.  Belgium 
has also promised one million euros in response to the Flash 
Appeal, which is earmarked for UNICEF, FAO and the Red Cross. 
 However, Belgium is relying on the UN for coordination of 
its overall assistance effort more than on the United States.
