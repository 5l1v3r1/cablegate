¶1. (SBU) Post has followed up with the GOF on the interim 
response reported in reftel A to points in reftel B.  On 
January 5, Francois Delmas, action officer from the 
interagency Afghanistan and Pakistan Cell, said that delayed 
transmission of the draft MOU from the French Embassy in 
Kabul to Paris and a lack of personnel over the Christmas and 
New Year holidays had unfortunately slowed the French reply. 
However, he said the French Joint Staff was currently leading 
an interagency effort to draft a detailed official response 
to the MOU, and stressed that, while he could not offer 
substantive comment at this time, the delay was purely 
bureaucratic and not a tactic to express disapproval with the 
MOU.  Adding that it was clear that this issue was of 
critical importance to Washington, Delmas said he would 
encourage GOF stakeholders to expedite the process.
