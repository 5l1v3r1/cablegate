SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (01/22): Palestinian media ask 
what has changed since President Obama took office 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
Independent daily Al-Quds leads with a headline quoting President 
Obama saying "We exaggerated about our capacity to end the Middle 
East conflict." Reports note that the Palestinian leadership 
reiterated that President Obama is committed to the two state 
solution, but stressed that in order to achieve this vision, Israel 
must abide by international laws and commit to the road map. 
Palestinian Authority (PA) official daily Al-Hayat Al-Jadida runs a 
lead photo of a banner hanging in Ramallah that has a picture of 
Obama and reads "One year for Obama...What has changed?" 
 
The dailies report that Special Envoy George Mitchell met with 
Israeli officials yesterday in Tel-Aviv and will meet President 
Mahmoud Abbas today in Ramallah. The reports note that Mitchell 
discussed Israeli gestures of goodwill that will support the 
re-launching of negotiations. PLO Chief Negotiator Saeb Erekat 
condemned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's statements 
that Israel will maintain its presence on the Eastern borders of a 
Palestinian state. Erekat noted that in order for Mitchell to 
succeed in his mission, Netanyahu's conditions should be ignored 
because they jeopardize the two state solution. 
 
PA Presidency spokesperson Nabil Abu Rudeina noted that the PA will 
not accept even one Israeli soldier in the Palestinian territories 
after the Israeli occupation is over and accused Netanyahu of 
putting more obstacles on the peace process. 
 
The PLO issued a statement yesterday accusing Israel of obstructing 
the peace talks by their continued settlement activities, noting 
that the Israelis are the ones that should be pressured, not the 
Palestinians. The statement also condemned the Israeli decision to 
open the first Israeli university in the West Bank, saying it "ruins 
all the foundations for negotiations." 
------------ 
BLOCK QUOTE: 
------------ 
Adel Abdel Rahman, writing in Al-Hayat Al-Jadida under the title 
"Netanyahu and Abu Mazen" opines that those who are concerned about 
achieving peace in the region and the world must first force Prime 
Minister Netanyahu to respect international laws and resolutions, 
especially a full cessation of all settlement activity.
