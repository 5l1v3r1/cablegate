RELATIONS (C-RE9-02730) 
 
REF: A. ROME 000097 
     ¶B. ROME 000948 ...


Classified By: ELISSA G. PITTERLE, DIRECTOR, INR/OPS 
 
 ¶1.  (C)  WASHINGTON ANALYSTS GREATLY APPRECIATE THE 
EXCELLENT REFS ON ITALIAN-RUSSIAN RELATIONS AND WOULD 
APPRECIATE ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THIS TOPIC, AS 
POST'S TIME AND RESOURCES PERMIT. BECAUSE ITALY IS ONE OF RUSSIA'S STRATEGIC PARTNERS IN EUROPE, THERE IS SIGNIFICANT POLICYMAKER INTEREST IN ITALY'S POLICIES TOWARDS RUSSIA AND THE FACTORS DRIVING THOSE POLICIES. ANY INFORMATION REGARDING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HIGH-LEVEL OFFICIALS, PARTICULARLY THOSE BETWEEN ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER SILVIO BERLUSCONI AND 
RUSSIAN PRIME MINSTER VLADIMIR PUTIN OR RUSSIAN PRESIDENT DIMITRY MEDVEDEV, AND ITALIAN FOREIGN POLICY TOWARDS RUSSIA WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED. 
 
¶2.  (C)  THERE IS ALSO CONTINUED POLICYMAKER INTEREST IN THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA, PARTICULARLY IN THE ENERGY SECTOR. ITALY IS AT THE FOREFRONT OF EUROPEAN ENERGY AND CONTINUES TO ENGAGE IN BUSINESS DEALS WITH GAZPROM, THE RUSSIAN ENERGY GIANT. ENI, ITALY'S PARTIALLY STATE-OWNED ENERGY CONGLOMERATE, IS GAZPROM'S LARGEST PARTNER IN ITS EFFORTS TO STREAMLINE THE SOUTH STREAM PIPELINE, AND WE ARE VERY INTERESTED IN HOW THE TWO COMPANIES 
ARE OPERATING TOGETHER. U.S. POLICYMAKERS ALSO REMAIN INTERESTED IN ITALY'S MOVEMENT TOWARDS ENERGY DIVERSIFICATION AND THE RESTART OF ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM. ANALYSTS WELCOME ANY AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON THESE TOPICS, AS TIME AND RESOURCES PERMIT. 
 
¶A.  (U)  FOREIGN AND ECONOMIC POLICY: 
 
1)  (C)  PLEASE PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION ON THE PERSONAL 
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RUSSIAN PM VLADIMIR PUTIN AND ITALIAN PM SILVIO BERLUSCONI. WHAT PERSONAL INVESTMENTS, IF ANY, DO THEY HAVE THAT MIGHT DRIVE THEIR FOREIGN OR ECONOMIC POLICIES? 
 
2)  (C)  WHAT FACTORS ARE DRIVING ITALY'S FOREIGN POLICY WITH RUSSIA? 
 
3)  (C)  HOW DO ITALIAN LEADERS VIEW U.S. FOREIGN POLICY 
TOWARDS RUSSIA. HAVE ITALIAN POLITICAL OR BUSINESS LEADERS INFLUENCED RUSSIAN POLICY AGAINST U.S. INTERESTS, AND IF SO, HOW? 
 
¶B.  (U)  ENERGY POLICY: 
 
1)  (C)  WHAT ARE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS' AND ENI 
OFFICIALS' VIEWS ON ITALY'S ENERGY RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA AND THE SOUTH STREAM PROJECT? WHERE DOES ITALIAN ENERGY POLICY CONVERGE WITH RUSSIAN ENERGY POLICY, ESPECIALLY REGARDING LIBYA AND THE BALKANS? 
 
2)  (C)  PLEASE PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ENI EXECUTIVES, INCLUDING CEO SCARONI, AND ITALIAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, ESPECIALLY PM BERLUSCONI AND THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS. 
 
3)  (C)  PLEASE PROVIDE EXAMPLES, IF POSSIBLE, OF ANY 
INSTANCES WHERE THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT MADE DECISIONS TO BENEFIT ITALIAN BUSINESS OR COMMERCIAL INTERESTS AT THE EXPENSE OF POLITICAL CONCERNS ABOUT ENERGY POLICY. 
 
¶3.  (U)  PLEASE CITE C-RE9-02730 IN THE SUBJECT LINE OF 
REPORTING IN RESPONSE TO THE ABOVE QUESTIONS.
