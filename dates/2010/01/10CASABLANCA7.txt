¶1.  (U) This cable responds to Ref A request for information on UN 
efforts to combat trafficking in persons (TIP) and sexual 
exploitation and abuse (SEA) involving UN peacekeeping mission 
personnel in the Western Sahara and Moroccan peacekeepers in Cote 
d'Ivoire the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  This message was 
cleared with Embassy Rabat and represents coordinated Mission 
views. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) According to the Government of Morocco (GOM), TIP and SEA 
are not a problem within the United Nations Mission on the 
Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO).  Redouan Houssaini, Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs (MFA) UN Division Chie, submitted a response in 
writing to Mission inqiries stating the MFA is not aware of any SEA 
orTIP issues pertaining to MINURSO. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) MINRSO Public Affairs Officer Carmen Johns told poloff 
that there were no cases of SEA or TIP misconduc in 2009.  MINURSO 
is currently in the process o hiring a new Conduct and Discipline 
Officer whowill be is responsible for briefing andtraining all new 
arrivals on SEA, TIP, and other conduct issues.  Johns reported that 
MINURSO conducts regular refresher training throughout the year. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Houssaini also reported there were no incidents of SEA or 
TIP among the 1,561 members of the Moroccan Armed Forces serving at 
the UN Peacekeeping Operations in Cote d'Ivoire (UNOCI) and in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC). 
 
¶5.  (U) In July 2007, Moroccan peacekeepers in Cote d'Ivoire were 
accused of sexual abuse involving underage girls.  The GOM fully 
supported UN efforts to investigate the accusations.  An inquiry 
team, consisting of UN investigators and Moroccan army officers, was 
unable to unearth any conclusive evidence of abuse.  No formal 
charges were filed (Ref B).  There have been no allegations 
regarding Moroccan peacekeepers since 2007. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Mission is unaware of any other official reports in 2009 
of SEA or TIP incidents involving MINURSO personnel or Moroccan 
peacekeepers in Cote d'Ivoire.  The Embassy's Human Rights officer 
contacted local NGOs in Laayoune, Western Sahara which reported they 
do not believe there are SEA or TIP problems connected to MINURSO.
