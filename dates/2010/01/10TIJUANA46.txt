ARREST  
REF: TIJUANA 0035 
 
¶1.     (SBU) On January 12, 2010, Post's Emergency Action 
Committee (EAC) was convened to discuss that morning's arrest of 
Eduardo Teodoro GARCIA-Simental (alias `El Teo' La Paz, Baja 
California Sur, Mexico (REFTEL).  EAC participants included CG, 
CONS, RSO, DEA, DHS-ICE, MGT, PAO, CLO, and ATF. 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) DEA informed EAC about the arrest details (REFTEL). 
Law Enforcement Working Group (LEWG) members indicated from 
their local knowledge they anticipate adverse local reaction 
against Mexico police and military from drug trafficking groups 
as reprisal for the arrest.  Additionally, lower level members 
of El Teo cartel will likely struggle to take over the group 
leadership in the power vacuum.  Lastly, opposing cartels may 
increase violent activity to take advantage of uncertain 
leadership in the El Teo drug cartel. 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) EAC members discussed Post preparations for response to 
any potential reaction or retaliation in the Tijuana area 
against local law enforcement, or against Post personnel or 
locally residing U.S. citizens.  EAC members have received no 
information from GOM police or intelligence sources indicating a 
specific increased threat against U.S. citizens or U.S. 
interests within Tijuana's Consular District. However, the EAC 
concluded that Post's security posture should be elevated to an 
increased level of alertness as appropriate for the situation. 
 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) At EAC recommendation, PAO followed US Embassy Mexico 
City press guidance; CONS is preparing a Warden Message; and RSO 
informed all Post personnel of the arrest by security, and 
reminded all they should always be aware of their surroundings, 
avoid conflict areas, vary routes, and practice good security 
measures. 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Tijuana's EAC will continue to monitor the security 
situation in Tijuana.  All members will remain in close contact 
with their local U.S. and Mexican contacts regarding any new 
developments. For comments or questions, please contact RSO at 
011-52-664-622-7464, or -7451.
