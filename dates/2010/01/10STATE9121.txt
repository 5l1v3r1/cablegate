¶1. Under Secretary for Management, Patrick Kennedy, 
authorized an Ordered Departure from Embassy Port-au- 
Prince on 01/13/2010.  With Ordered Departure in effect, 
State Department and inter-agency personnel seeking 
Temporary Duty (TDY) in Embassy Port-au-Prince need 
approval from both the Ambassador and Under Secretary 
Kennedy before they can travel to post.  This does not 
apply to U.S. military personnel under USSOUTHCOM 
authority. 
 
¶2. Obtaining country clearance approval is necessary 
BEFORE a USG person can request permission to carry a 
firearm in support of USG operations.  If country 
clearance is granted, the requestor must subsequently 
obtain permission from Chief of Mission to carry a 
firearm in support of USG operations in Haiti. Once 
country clearance is approved, the traveler should 
inform RSO Port-au-Prince of the country clearance. 
Then RSO PaP will provide the traveler with a copy of 
Post's Firearms Policy as well as a form to request 
permission to carry a weapon in support of USG 
operations.  That request will be reviewed by RSO and 
Chief of Mission before a determination is rendered on 
whether the traveler can carry a weapon in Haiti.  Any 
armed Federal Agent found to be working in Haiti without 
COM approval will be instructed to leave country 
immediately.  The above does not apply to U.S. military 
personnel under USSOUTHCOM authority. 
 
¶3. The COM and RSO only review firearm requests for USG 
personnel traveling in support of USG operations.  The 
U.S. Embassy has arrangements with the Government of 
Haiti as it relates to firearm requests in support of 
U.S. Embassy operations.  Note: The Haitian National 
Police have arrested armed private security in the 
past.  The U.S. Embassy is not aware of any standing 
authorization for private persons or companies to enter 
Haiti armed. 
 
¶4. Should you have more general questions on weapons, or 
other queries for RSO, please consider directing them to 
the Diplomatic Security Agent working on the Haiti Task 
Force at 1TFH@state.gov. 
 
¶5. Minimized considered.
