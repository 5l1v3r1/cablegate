SUMMARY 
AND COMMENT 
----------- 
 
¶1. (SBU)  Chad's national election process has gained 
significant momentum since President Deby's December 5 
convocation of political party leaders to unite them around 
the common goal of credible legislative and municipal 
elections in 2010.  Chad's international partners including 
the U.S. have formed a working group to coordinate assistance 
to the electoral process, advising UNDP experts on a draft 
electoral timetable for polling as called for in the August 
13, 2007 Accord.  On December 28, Deby met with key 
institutional actors -- the Independent National Electoral 
Commission (CENI), the Steering Committee for achievement of 
August 13 Accords (Comite de suivi), and international 
democratic partners to prevail on them to work toward the 
common goal of elections this year and next.  Chad's 
electoral calendar, adopted January 6 by the CENI, sets 
November 28, 2010 as the date for legislative elections; 
December 12, 2010 as the date for Chad's first-ever municipal 
elections; and April 23, 2011 as the date for presidential 
elections.  The next two essential steps -- setting up a 
Permanent Electoral Board and carrying out an electoral 
census to establish voter rolls -- will take place in January 
2010, and March to May, 2010, respectively. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Although this ambitious electoral process could 
eventually fall behind schedule, it provides a template for 
potential success, and will give the international working 
group the ability to foresee poential problems in advance and 
to deploy its advice, encouragement and assistance 
appropriately and effectively, especially at predictable 
sticking points.  President Deby's two interventions and the 
coordinated, targeted support of the international community 
have been key to momentum in a process that had been lagging 
following the establishment of the CENI in July.  END SUMMARY 
AND COMMENT.

INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE KEY 
-------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  International advice and involvement have been key 
to resolving some long-standing debates within the Chadian 
body politic that had earlier blocked agreement on whether to 
hold elections, and later to set a date for them.  An ad hoc 
ambassadorial-level working group of democratic nations and 
entities -- comprised of representatives from UNDP, EU, AU, 
OIF, France, Germany, and Switzerland, as well as the U.S. -- 
has been meeting bi-weekly since November to ensure good 
international cooperation and cohesion with respect to Chad's 
electoral preparations.  The group met December 24 with 
visiting UNDP experts to work out a detailed timeline for 
upcoming votes.  In addition to laying out notional dates for 
legislative, municipal and presidential contests, the group 
specified a timeframe for announcement and certification of 
electoral results and outlined changes that would likely be 
necessary to Chadian law in order for elections to take place 
on schedule.  The group recommended that the number of 
polling stations currently called for -- some 17,000 -- be 
reduced, and that an upper limit on the number of National 
Assembly deputies be set at 180. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  The ad hoc working group also agreed 
provisionally, pending final approval in New York and 
Brussels, that UNDP would serve as overall coordinator of 
international assistance to the Chadian electoral process, 
with UNDP experts taking the lead on help with the electoral 
census, and that the EU would be deputy international 
coordinator, taking the lead on advice-giving to the CENI. 
Other members of the ad hoc working group have agreed to 
coordinate their support to the electoral process, both

advice-giving and financial.

MOMENTUM BUILDING 
----------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU)   UNDP presented the international community's 
timeline, proposals and recommendations to President Deby on 
December 28, in the company of reps of the CENI and Comite se 
suivi.  Deby stressed his commitment to elections in 2010 and 
¶2011.  He said that Chad was capable of staging democratic 
processes and that it wanted international electoral 
assistance.  He specified that per the August 2007 Accord on 
rapprochement between governing and opposition parties, the 
Comite de suivi (on which the international community has 
observer seats) should assist the CENI in electoral 
preparations.  (In November, Deby revitalized the Electoral 
Reform Committee by naming the dynamic new Chairman of his 
Popular Movement for Solidarity party, former Prime Minister 
Nagoum Yamassoum, as head of the MPS delegation on the body.) 
 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  UNDP's timeline was given to the CENI on January 
5, and that body adopted it unanimously one day later.  In a 
press conference on January 6, CENI head Ngarmadjal Gami laid 
out the dates for 2010 and 2011 elections and dates during 
which the electoral census would be conducted.  He conceded 
that the CENI had made a slow start in the months following 
its establishment in July 2009, but he promised a 
considerably accelerated pace with respect to legislative 
reforms necessary to keep the electoral timetable on track, 
and also with respect to technical preparations such as 
districting.  Gami noted that the CENI would work closely 
with the Chadian media to see that information on electoral 
processes and voter entitlements was disseminated widely in 
advance of the various contests.

USG ASSISTANCE 
TO CHAD ELECTIONS 
----------------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU)  A USAID team of democracy and conflict experts 
visited Chad December 5-18, consulted extensively in 
N'Djamena and elsewhere, and arrived at a plan to spend USD 
five million for elections and election-related conflict 
mitigation activities.  This plan reflected Post's priorities 
and was welcomed by the GOC and by international partners to 
whom it was briefed, including our colleagues on the 
international working group, MINURCAT, etc.  (NOTE:  In 2009, 
USG contributed 1.3 million USD to a national demographic 
census, a prerequisite for the subsequent election process.)

¶8.  (SBU)  Although this ambitious electoral process could 
eventually fall behind schedule, it provides a template for 
success, and will give the international working group the 
ability to foresee poential problems in advance and to deploy 
its advice, encouragement and assistance appropriately and 
effectively, especially at predictable sticking points. 
President Deby's two interventions and the coordinated, 
targeted support of the international community have been key 
to momentum in a process that had been lagging following the 
establishment of the CENI in July.
