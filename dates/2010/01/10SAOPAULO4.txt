"Presidential Turbulence" 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (1-6) says: ".... 
[President] Lula committed Brazil to France based on a personal 
choice whose motives are questionable.  He just forgot to reach 
common ground with the military.....the idea that the Rafale is 
indispensable to the strategic partnership between France and 
Brazil is unsustainable, because this partnership has already been 
established by the submarine deal....postponing the decision is 
likely to be less onerous for Lula, but this would mean leaving 
Brazil's jet fighter fleet obsolete for any type of aerial combat. 
...." 
 
 
 
"Putting the Cart before the Horse" 
 
Editorial in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (1-6) notes: 
".....announcing the preference for the French model when the bid 
was still underway was not only disrespectful but a lousy way of 
trying to reduce the price......Maybe Brazil will acquire more 
knowledge, profits and technology by choosing the French option, 
but it may be dangerously dependent on the whims of French 
government.  The debate in these terms is legitimate and there are 
good arguments on both sides.  But any decision cannot be made 
without a rigorous technical evaluation."
