¶1.  Summary.  USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (USAID/DART) 
staff report that the final U.S. Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) 
teams departed Haiti on January 27, as coordination efforts 
continue to advance response capacity for earthquake-affected 
populations in Haiti.  A small contingent of U.S. USAR members will 
remain in Haiti capable of responding to potential search and 
rescue requests.  Water trucking deliveries have increased to 133 
sites in recent days, reaching more than 400,000 beneficiaries per 
day.  However, inadequate sanitation services at displaced person 
spontaneous settlements sites remain a significant concern.  To 
date, USAID has contributed nearly $230 million in earthquake 
response funding to address the critical needs of affected 
populations.  End summary.

COORDINATION 
 
------------ 
 
 
 
¶2.  The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs 
(OCHA) has established sub-cluster coordination operations in 
Leogane and is looking to expand a presence to other heavily 
affected areas, including Jacmel.  Similarly, sector-specific 
clusters, including health and water, sanitation, and hygiene 
(WASH) are establishing coordination meetings in locations outside 
the capital.  The U.N. WASH Cluster has established coordination 
meetings in Leogane, Petit Goave, Grand Goave, Gressier, and 
Jacmel.  The Health Cluster is establishing sub-clusters in Leogane 
and Jacmel. 
 
 
 
¶3.  USAID/DART staff report that the multi-sectoral, multi-agency 
rapid assessment of spontaneous settlement areas, led by OCHA, 
began in Port-au-Prince on January 25.  Teams will continue 
assessments in the capital on January 27 before moving to 
additional locations in other departments.  Final results from the 
assessment are expected during the week of January 31.  USAID/DART 
staff note that the information compiled from the ongoing 
multi-sectoral assessments is critical to identifying gaps in 
coverage and inform appropriate response measures in the sectors of 
health, nutrition, water, sanitation, security, and shelter. 
 
 
 
¶4.  On January 26, USAID/DART staff participated in a donor 
coordination meeting in Port-au-Prince and noted a positive 
convergence of response priorities and approaches among donors that 
should facilitate enhanced coordination, including a focus on 
supporting a shelter and settlements approach supported by 
integrated WASH, livelihoods, health, and nutrition interventions. 
 
 
 
¶5.  To facilitate local Haitian non-governmental organization (NGO) 
engagement in response efforts, USAID's Office of U.S. Foreign 
Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA) has activated USAID/OFDA's Haiti 
consultant through an existing mechanism to serve as a local NGO 
liaison to the U.N. Emergency Shelter and Non-Food Item (NFI) 
Cluster to ensure local NGO access and participation in the 
distribution of emergency relief supplies as part of Haiti response 
efforts.

WATER, SANITATION, AND HYGIENE 
 
------------------------------ 
 
¶6.  USAID/DART staff report that water availability and access 
continues to improve for earthquake-affected populations.  In 
recent days, the number of water distribution sites receiving daily 
water delivery through a coordinated fleet of approximately 160 
water tanker trucks has increased from 115 to 133.  More than 2 
million liters per day are currently delivered to an estimated 
400,000 beneficiaries throughout Port-au-Prince out of a total 
target population of 500,000 beneficiaries at approximately 200 
sites. 
 
 
 
¶7.  However, inadequate sanitation facilities at displaced person 
sites continue to be of significant concern, according to the 
USAID/DART.  The USAID/DART is strongly advocating with the 
Government of Haiti (GOH)  National Direction for Potable Water and 
Sanitation (DINEPA) and the U.N. WASH Cluster to advance the 
construction of latrines as quickly as possible to prevent a 
further deterioration of conditions and a potential escalation in 
disease outbreaks.  The U.N. WASH Cluster estimates that a total of 
5,000 latrines are needed at this time for spontaneous settlement 
sites. 
 
 
 
¶8.  As of January 26, USAID/OFDA has supported and received 27 
flights containing relief commodities, including chlorination 
tablets, water purification units capable of providing 15,000 
liters of clean water per hour, water containers, and hygiene kits. 
As of January 26, USAID/OFDA had consigned 20 water bladders, 
100,000 water containers and 50,000 family hygiene kits to 
implementing partner the International Organization for Migration 
(IOM) for distribution to affected populations.

SEARCH AND RESCUE TEAMS 
 
----------------------- 
 
 
 
¶9.  Following demobilization on January 26, the final U.S. USAR 
teams departed Haiti on January 27. Operations have transitioned 
from search and rescue to recovery efforts, with the U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers (USACE) conducting recovery activities at the 
Hotel Montana, according to the USAID/DART staff.  The USACE team 
plans to remain on-site at the Hotel Montana for the duration of 
the recovery effort.  However, a small contingent of U.S. USAR 
specialists will remain in Haiti, capable of responding to 
potential search and rescue requests.  According to the U.N. 
Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) Team, between January 
13 and 23, international USAR teams rescued a total of 134 people, 
of which 47 individuals were by rescued by U.S.-based USAR teams.

USAID ASSISTANCE

¶10.  On January 25, USAID/DART staff coordinated the distribution 
of USAID/OFDA-funded U.S. USAR tent supplies to the U.N. Children's 
Fund (UNICEF) and area hospitals, including three 19X35-foot tents 
to the Foyer L'Escale orphanage in northern Port-au-Prince and one 
19X35-foot tent to the U.N. logistics base located at the UNICEF 
compound.  The donated tents will be utilized for the creation of 
child-friendly spaces at the L'Escale orphanage and will complement 
coordination efforts between UNICEF and the GoH's Ministry of 
Social Affairs to increase support for earthquake-affected orphans. 
In addition, USAID/DART and U.S. USAR team members delivered and 
erected one 19X35-foot tent and three 20-foot octagonal tents at 
the University of Miami field hospital at the Port-au-Prince 
airport and three additional 19X35-foot tents to the Port-au-Prince 
general hospital to enhance hospital operations. 
 
¶11.  According to the USAID/DART, offloading of USAID/OFDA-funded 
emergency relief supplies from the USNS LUMMUS at the 
Port-au-Prince port continued as of 1200 hours local time on 
January 26.  On January 25, USAID/DART staff reported that 1,632 
kitchen sets - to benefit approximately 8,160 individuals - and 210 
rolls of plastic sheeting - to benefit an estimated 10,500 people - 
were offload for consignment to implementing partner the 
International Organization for Migration (IOM) for distribution. 
The commodities supplement 1,584 kitchen sets, 190 rolls of plastic 
sheeting, and 16,650 humanitarian daily rations offloaded from the 
USNS LUMMUS on January 24. 
 
 
 
¶12.  As of January 26, USAID had contributed nearly $230 million in 
earthquake response funding, including more than $152 million from 
USAID/OFDA, $68 million from USAID's Office of Food for Peace 
(USAID/FFP), $5 million from USAID's Office of Transition 
Initiatives, more than $3.5 million from USAID/Haiti, and $1 
million from USAID/Dominican Republic.  On January 25, USAID/OFDA 
awarded $1 million to Samaritan's Purse for health, economic 
recovery, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) activities and 
$5 million to Save the Children for health, nutrition, and 
protection activities in affected areas.  In total, the U.S. 
Government has contributed nearly $356 million in earthquake 
response funding for Haiti to date.
