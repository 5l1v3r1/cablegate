SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: VENEZUELA PRESS FREEDOM 
 
Chavez Advances towards Dictatorship 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (1-28) notes: 
"....It is evident that Chavez increased violence against freedom 
of the press in a useless attempt to obfuscate the real situation 
of the deteriorating Venezuelan economy and the Bolivarian public 
administration......The reaction among the Venezuelan people to 
Chavez's decisions has been growing......Chavez's moves to limit 
press freedom are not an isolated phenomenon in Latin America....In 
other countries such as Bolivia with Evo Morales, Ecuador with 
Rafael Correa and Argentina with the Kirchner couple.....those in 
power have adopted concrete measures to curb the press."
