¶1. This message responds to reftel request for Embassy input on 
potential OPIC financing to Afghan Growth Finance Company (AGF), a 
non-bank financial institution operating in Afghanistan.  AGF is 
dedicated to providing debt financing to Afghan small and medium 
size enterprises (SMEs) with a focus in agribusiness. 
 
¶2. AGF -- and its U.S. sponsor, Small Enterprise Assistance Funds 
(SEAF), and AGF Country Director Mustafa Kazem -- are favorably 
known to State and USAID officers at post.  Embassy Kabul has no 
adverse information on AFG, SEAF or Mr. Kazam, with respect to 
potential ties to terrorism, money laundering, corruption, 
violations of law, or commercial and financial considerations. 
 
¶3.  Our Mission is familiar with AGF's recent loan history to Afghan 
SMEs, now totaling approximately USD 10 million.  Embassy supports 
AGF's plan to provide medium-term loans ranging from USD 50,000 to 2 
million to Afghan SMEs focusing in agribusiness and other sectors. 
To date, AGF is only one of a handful of lending institutions in 
Afghanistan willing to extend significant term loans to Afghan SMEs. 
 In addition, AFG provides much needed technical assistance in the 
areas of budget and accounting management, cost controls, management 
and inventory management to help ensure success for the borrower's 
enterprises. 
 
¶4.  In the World Bank's 2010 "Doing Business Report," Afghanistan 
ranks 127 out of 183 countries for obtaining credit, a 53-place 
increase from 180 in 2009.  However, access to credit continues to 
be identified as serious obstacle to investment in Afghanistan 
especially in the agricultural sector.  The U.S. Mission therefore 
fully supports AGF's OPIC application.
