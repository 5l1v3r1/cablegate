¶1. (SBU) PolOff delivered ref A and B points to the MOD 
Policy State Secretary Jozsef Bali and MFA's Security Policy 
and Non-proliferation Deputy Department Head, Gabor Horvath, 
January 15.  Both expressed appreciation for the ref A's 
clarifying points and acknowledged the importance of 
continued, unwavering support for ISAF efforts in 
Afghanistan.  Horvath expressed interest in further 
information as to what impact the proposed ISAF transition 
plan would have on the Hungarian PRT in Baghlan province, 
stating that he would follow up with the Hungarian Permanent 
Representative at NATO. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In response to ref A point on the upcoming Defense 
Ministerial in Istanbul February 4, Bali reiterated Hungary's 
offer to add 200 troops in 2010 outlined in ref C.  Bali was 
unaware that the Prime Minister told the Ambassador January 
14 that the number will increase to 235 (septel), but 
confirmed that the Prime Minister and Finance Minister had 
recently met to source funding for the additional troops from 
2010 budget reserves. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Turning to the ref B proposed meeting with D/SRAP 
Paul Jones at the January 25-27 PRT conference in Prague, 
Horvath said that Eszter Sandorfi, MFA's NATO Section Head 
and Deputy Secretary of the GOH Cabinet's PRT Committee, will 
lead Hungary's delegation and would gladly participate in the 
closed, pre-conference session.
