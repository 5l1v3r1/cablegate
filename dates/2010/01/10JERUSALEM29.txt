SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (01/07): Israel plans for more new 
settlements in East Jerusalem neighborhoods 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
Independent daily Al-Quds and PA official daily Al-Hayat Al-Jadida 
lead with news that the Jerusalem municipality endorsed the 
construction of a new Jewish neighborhood in Shufat, which will 
include a commercial center and three large buildings. The reports 
note that the Israeli authorities will confiscate approximately 
5,000 square meters of land in order to build the new neighborhood. 
According to Israeli Radio, this new neighborhood is one of 60 
similar projects the municipality intends to pursue in the Shufat 
and Beit-Hanina neighborhoods. 
 
In related news, Al-Quds runs a separate front page story citing 
Wafa that the Israeli authorities submitted 13 demolition orders 
against Palestinian houses in the south Nablus area yesterday and 
gave the families 48 hours to leave their homes. 
 
The dailies front page news that the humanitarian aid convoy for 
Gaza reached the Rafah border crossing yesterday and entered Gaza 
after two days of bloody clashes with the Egyptian police. According 
to press reports, the clashes resulted in the death of one Egyptian 
police officer and injured dozens of Palestinians. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida's lead headline highlights President Abbas 
telling the Kuwaiti press yesterday that he signed the national 
reconciliation agreement despite US pressure not to. 
 
Maan runs a report citing Israeli TV Channel 10 news that Israeli 
Defense Forces completed a large-scale military drill in the Negev 
preparing troops for a military offensive against the Gaza Strip. 
The report, aired Tuesday evening, speculated that the training 
could be seen as preparation for a re-occupation of the territory. 
 
Maan also reports that the Palestine Liberation Organization's (PLO) 
Mission to the United States announced on Wednesday that its new 
website and Facebook page were up and running. "Both are part of our 
larger effort to improve our communications and relations with the 
American-Palestinian community and the American public at large," 
said Christopher Hazou, the PLO's communications officer in 
Washington. 
 
The local press highlights the U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem 
sponsoring a digital video conference on the H1N1 virus with Daniel 
Rutz, Associate Director of Communication Science for the National 
Center for Infectious Diseases of the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention on Wednesday to help combat the misinformation in 
some of the local and regional press about the virus and vaccine. 
The Director General of Primary Care and Public Health of the PA 
Ministry of Health, Dr. Asad Ramlawi, moderated the discussion with 
Palestinian health practitioners from various PA ministries, as well 
as representatives from other local and international organizations 
and members of the Palestinian press corps.

BLOCK QUOTE: 
------------ 
Asad Abdel Rahman, writing in Al-Quds under the title "Four States 
in Historic Palestine!" proposes a cynical analysis reflecting how 
miserable the situation is in Palestine. Abdel Rahman notes that 
practically speaking, there are four states within Palestine: The 
State of Israel; the State of Settlers; the State of the West Bank; 
 
JERUSALEM 00000029  002 OF 002 
 
 
and, the State of Gaza. He wonders whether it will ever be possible 
to restore Palestine with these facts on the ground.
