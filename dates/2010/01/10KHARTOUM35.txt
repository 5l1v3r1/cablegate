REF: A) 09 KHARTOUM 1401 
 
¶1. (SBU) Khartoum media reported on January 6 that Abyei Chief 
Administrator Arop Moyak Monytoc (SPLM), as well as the Abyei 
Administration's directors of Finance, Agriculture, and 
Infrastructure, had been fired for alleged corruption.  A relatively 
minor political figure, Deng Arop Kuol (SPLM), Chair of the Legal 
Committee of the Southern Sudan Legislative Assembly (SSLA), was 
appointed as Monytoc's replacement.  It is likely that Kuol will be 
a more effective Administrator than Monytoc, who was rarely in Abyei 
and was not productive when he was there (Ref A).

Corrupt, or Out of Friends? 
--------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) On January 6, Khartoum media reported that Omar el Bashir, 
President of the Government of Sudan (GoS), issued a presidential 
degree relieving Arop Moyak Monytoc of his position as Abyei's Chief 
Administrator, as well as the Abyei Administration's directors of 
Finance, Agriculture, and Infrastructure.  The actions were taken as 
a result of alleged corruption.  Bashir appointed Deng Arop Kuol, 
theCair of Leead Ckm}itdeE nF 4he`Soet(epN Seln L}fisqvvg-Aq3ejBh0*CL1aQNnnyDo 
?q@~(Note: In a January 6 
telephone conversation with Poloff, David Raikow, United Nations 
Mission in Sudan political officer, noted that Monytoc's ineffective 
leadership and inflammatory statements had caused officials in both 
parties to lose patience with him. The corruption charges, while 
potentially merited, may therefore have simply been a catalyst or an 
excuse to remove him.  End Note.)

Uncontroversial Replacement 
--------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Deng Arop Kuol, a lawyer by training, is the Chair of the 
SSLA Legal Committee.   In a January 6 telephone conversation with 
Poloff, Raikow characterized Kuol as an uncontroversial choice with 
limited political capital, installed as a caretaker. However, Kuol 
is reportedly a cousin of and maintains close family relations with 
GoNU Foreign Minister Deng Alor (SPLM) and GoSS Minister of 
Presidential Affairs Luka Biong Deng (SPLM), connections that 
possibly could provide him with increased influence. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Comment.  Arop Moyak Monytoc was rarely in Abyei and had a 
reputation for increasing, rather than defusing, tensions in the 
region.  His removal is overdue and unlikely to be mourned by GoNU 
officials or the people of Abyei.  There is reason to hope that Kuol 
will be a more effective Administrator.  Charge met with Kuol on 
January 7, as reported septel.  End Comment.
