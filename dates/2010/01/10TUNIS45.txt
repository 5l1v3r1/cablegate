(SBU) Aside from an expression of sympathy and condolence 
from President Ben Ali (ref C), there has been no reporting 
in the Tunisian media of material assistance from the GOT to 
the international relief efforts in Haiti.  Mourad Belhassan, 
Deputy Director of the Americas Desk at the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, told us on January 20 that he was unaware of 
any GOT plans to offer assistance to Haiti, although he did 
not rule out the possibility.
