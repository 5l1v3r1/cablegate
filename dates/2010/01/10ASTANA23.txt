¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  During recent visits to Kazakhstan's Kostanai 
and North Kazakhstan Oblasts, interlocutors emphasized the tolerant 
nature of Kazakhstani society and government efforts to encourage 
ethnic harmony.  According to Viktor Sayko, Director of one of the 
North Kazakhstan Oblast's three organizations of ethnic Russians, 
ethnic Russians are generally content as Kazakhstani citizens, but 
some worry about potential compulsory study of the Kazakh language 
and employment discrimination.  END SUMMARY. 
 
KOSTANAI OFFICIALS PRAISE INTER-ETHNIC TOLERANCE 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Tatyana Zueva, Kostanai Oblast's Internal Policy 
Department representative, told PolOff that the oblast's 950,000 
residents represent more than 120 nationalities.  The region's main 
ethnic groups include Russians, Kazakhs, and Germans.  Zueva, an 
ethnic Russian, spoke often about Kazakh traditions and their 
importance in Kostanai.  Zueva mentioned her studies of the Kazakh 
language at the Akimat (regional administration), and pointed out 
tributes to Kazakh culture, by artists of various ethnicities, in 
Kostanai's art gallery.  Zueva emphasized that Kazakhstan has 
experienced no major incidents of ethnic violence since its 
independence in 1991. 
 
HOUSE OF FRIENDSHIP FLOURISHES 
 
¶4.  (SBU) At Kostanai's House of Friendship, a large two-story 
building with 16 small offices for some of the major ethnic groups 
in Kazakhstan, PolOff met its young director, Anton Trukhanov.  A 
former journalist and television commentator, Trukhanov explained 
the importance of teaching the children of various nationalities 
about their cultures and languages in order to continue the city's 
development as a harmonious, multi-cultural and artistically-vibrant 
locale.  Student dance and musical performances for a New Year 
celebration occupied the House of Friendship's theater during 
PolOff's visit.  Kostanai's largest ethnic groups -- Russians, 
Germans, Ukrainians, and Tatars -- have centrally-located offices 
near the Director's, while a statue of a sheaf of wheat, hung with 
the flags of ethnic groups in Kazakhstan, dominates the building's 
lobby. 
 
NORTH KAZAKHSTAN TOUTS ETHNIC HARMONY 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Erlik Zhandildin, Director of North Kazakhstan Oblast 
Akimat's Internal Policy Department, joined Kostanai Oblast 
officials in touting inter-ethnic accord in northern Kazakhstan.  He 
noted his oblast's 650,000 residents represent 100 nationalities, 
mainly Russians, Kazakhs, Poles, and Germans.  The region also 
established a 125-house settlement, called Bayterek, for Oralmans. 
(NOTE:  The Kazakhstani government has been encouraging ethnic 
Kazakhs, most of whom left Kazakhstan before the Soviet period, to 
return to Kazakhstan.  Returnees are called Oralmans.  END NOTE.) 
Zhandildin, an ethnic Kazakh, attributed the region's ethnic harmony 
to waves of migration over the last 100 years, as well as to the 
central and local government's continuing efforts to foster harmony, 
for instance, by funding ethno-cultural associations.  As Zhandildin 
told PolOff, "each person here has their own world view; in North 
Kazakhstan oblast, we believe in letting people live." 
 
ETHNIC RUSSIANS LIVE COMFORTABLY IN NORTH KAZAKHSTAN 
 
¶6.  (SBU) In an arrangement similar to Kostanai Oblast's House of 
Friendship, North Kazakhstan Oblast's Akimat provides rent-free 
space and modest funding for cultural events to 20 cultural centers, 
including  Viktor Sayko's "Russian Community" organization.  Sayko 
asserted that ethnic Russians, who constitute 80% of the region's 
population, live very comfortably in North Kazakhstan Oblast.  He 
argued that emigration decreased in the last few years due to good 
relations between ethnic Russians and Kazakhs.  Sayko further noted 
that most of the thousand citizens who left Kazakhstan within the 
last few years went to Omsk, close to Kazakhstan, and Kaliningrad,

which is seen as a gateway to Europe.  According to Sayko, most 
emigres were either unemployed, or "moved out of concern for the 
long-term future of their children."  Sayko said most patrons of his 
organization's free consultations about emigration issues thought 
they could more easily obtain jobs or live on their pensions in 
Russia.  However, many have found Kazakhstan's economy better, he 
underlined, and have returned. 
 
DIFFERING VIEWS OF ETHNIC RUSSIAN ORGANIZATIONS 
 
¶7.  (SBU) According to Sayko, Petropavlovsk's two other Russian 
organizations "complain more" about ethnic Russians' difficulties in 
modern Kazakhstan, especially the study of the Kazakh language.  In 
addition, he mentioned their criticism of his organization for 
"accommodating" the Akimat.  Sayko highlighted job discrimination as 
the most important concern.  At the same time, he acknowledged that 
the refusal of many ethnic Russians to learn Kazakh makes it 
difficult for them to occupy certain positions. 
 
WHAT ROLE SHOULD THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT PLAY? 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Sayko, who praised the Kazakhstani government and 
President Nazarbayev for maintaining inter-ethnic harmony, said he 
gathered one million signatures in support of Nazarbayev in 2005. 
Noting the 40 million ethnic Russians worldwide, Sayko advocated 
that ethnic Russians develop a sense of community and ethnic pride 
-- within an overarching identity as Kazakhstani citizens -- based 
on the model of strong Armenian, Jewish, and Korean communities. 
According to Sayko, the Russian Embassy sometimes provides small 
grants to Russian cultural centers for special activities, and his 
organization encourages participation in events, such as the third 
congress of Russian-speaking populations.  However, Sayko asserted 
ethnic Russians in Kazakhstan should not involve themselves in 
political issues between Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation. 
Commenting on a Russian initiative to distribute Russian "identity 
cards," Sayko told PolOff, "I have a Kazakhstani passport, and that 
is the only identity document I need."  Sayko added that his 
organization is considering carefully the proposal even though he 
personally sees no benefits. 
 
AN ETHNIC RUSSIAN ORGANIZATION'S VIEW ON THE CUSTOMS UNION 
 
¶9.  (SBU) In response to PolOff's inquiry about the Customs Union 
effect on the North Kazakhstan oblast, and particularly ethnic 
Russians, Sayko highlighted the positive response of businessmen 
involved in trade with Russia.  However, he also asserted ethnic 
Russians are more concerned about the movement of people than goods. 
 According to Sayko, Kazakhstani citizens previously could travel to 
Russia for up to 90 days without a visa, but had to register with 
immigration authorities within three days of arrival.  Sayko praised 
amended regulations, which allow visa-and-registration-free travel 
to Russia for up to one month. 
 
¶10.  (SBU) COMMENT:  Ethnic Russians in Kazakhstan sometimes have 
been portrayed as a fifth column of support for the Russian 
Federation.  Post considers this assessment grossly inaccurate. 
While most Russian-Kazakhstanis have relatives and other ties to 
Russia, the vast majority perceive themselves as loyal Kazakhstani 
citizens.  While some worry about the perceived employment bias in 
favor of Kazakhs, most have chosen to remain in Kazakhstan.  A few 
ethnic Slavs, most considered to be of Russian ethnicity, occupy 
influential positions within the government, notably Vladimir 
Shkolnik, President of KazAtomProm, and Roman Vassilenko, one of 
Foreign Minister Kanat Saudabayev's right-hand men.  Despite the 
plethora of views about ethnic relations in Kazakhstan, authorities 
throughout the country have clearly worked hard -- and generally 
succeeded -- in the creation of a peaceful and harmonious society. 
Although all seems relatively well now, any significant rise in 
Kazakh nationalism could cause problems in the future.  END 
COMMENT.
