RAPPROCHEMENT 
ON FAST TRACK 
------------- 
 
¶1. (SBU)  FORMIN Faki told Ambassador January 11 that 
Chad-Sudan rapprochement continued to gain momentum, with 
these key developments January 7-12: 
 
-- Chadian and Sudanese "technical teams" signed documents 
January 7 in NDjamena aimed at implementing the border 
security provisions of the 2006 Bilateral Protocol agreed in 
Khartoum. 
 
-- The Dr. Ghazi-led Sudanese "political team" met with the 
Faki-led Chadian "political team" in NDjamena January 7-9. 
 
-- GOC MFA released a communique January 9 pledging that GOC 
had undertaken to end support to any Sudanese rebel group; to 
eliminate Sudanese rebel presence from Chad; and to prevent 
any anti-Sudanese activity to take place on Chad territory. 
The communique claimed that the GOS had undertaken reciprocal 
engagements vis-avis rebels on its territory. 
 
-- Dr. Ghazi met with JEM's Khalil Ibrahim January 9 or 10. 
This followed the heavy-weight GOC delegation to deliver a 
stern Deby ultimatum to JEM last week which we reported in 
Ref A.  As Faki said to me yesterday:  "The JEM must leave 
Chad. Period." 
 
-- Dr. Ghazi departed then departed for Tripoli for talks 
with GOL to get Libyan imprimatur of Chad-Sudan rapprochement. 
 
-- Dr. Ghazi was expected back in NDjamena January 11 or 12 
to continue talks with Faki.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶2. (SBU)  These rapidly paced recent events nearly speak for 
themselves, but we note: 
 
-- The Faki-Ghazi bilateral track continues to go from 
apparent success to apparent success. 
 
-- The explicit and detailed GOC communique puts the Deby 
Government on the line for implementation of its engagements, 
especially regarding JEM. 
 
-- The GOC ultimatum to JEM and the Ghazi-JEM meeting could 
be constitutive of an end to the "proxy war" on this side of 
the border. 
 
-- GOC and GOS are wise to seek early Libyan blessing of the 
main terms of the rapprochement, which is, we think, 
essential to further success.
