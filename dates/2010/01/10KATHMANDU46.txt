REF: SECSTATE 004854 
 
¶1.  (U) SCA PDAS Patrick Moon discussed the earthquake in 
Haiti with Chief of the Army Staff Gurung on January 19. 
General Gurung reported that Nepal had two battalions serving 
in the UN Peace Keeping operation, MINUSTAH, in Haiti when 
the earthquake struck.  One soldier was injured and two Nepal 
Army vehicles were damaged. 
 
¶2.  (U) Since the earthquake, the Nepal Army has provided 
significant assistance in the rescue and relief operations. 
The 1,079 army personnel in Haiti have established temporary 
medical and evacuation centers in their battalion locations. 
Doctors from the battalions are treating injured in the 
wreckage and in medical centers.  Army troops are patroling 
and providing general law and order as the security situation 
deteriorates.  Other troops have been mobilized for general 
relief assistance and to escort and distribute relief 
materials to victims.  The Nepal Army is also providing 
temporary shelter to some of the UN personnel who have been 
displaced. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Other than its involvement in the UN Mission, Nepal 
has not offered additional humanitarian support. 
Should the UN request additional troops for the Haiti 
mission, Nepal would consider such a request but would 
require logistical support to transport troops and equipment.
