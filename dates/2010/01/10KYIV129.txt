¶1.  (U) The Government of Ukraine (GOU) has no principle objections 
to associating with the Copenhagen Accord.  However, given upcoming 
Presidential elections, it is uncertain that Ukraine will complete 
its association by the January 31 deadline.  Post delivered reftel 
talking points to Igor Lupaltsov, head of the National Environmental 
Investment Agency (NEIA) and head of Ukraine's Copenhagen 
delegation, and to Dmytro Matushenko, Economic Cooperation 
Department Officer at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), urging 
the GOU to associate with the Copenhagen Accord and present its 
emission reduction target by January 31.  Representatives at the 
NEIA and the MFA told us that that their respective agencies had no 
objections to Ukraine's association but the final decision would be 
made by the Cabinet of Ministers (CabMin).  On January 24, the 
Acting Deputy Chief of Mission discussed the issue and passed reftel 
points to the Deputy Prime Minister's chief advisor, Igor Zhovkva. 
Zhovkva said that Ukraine was likely to associate itself, and that 
the CabMin would base its decision on Lupaltsov's recommendations. 
 
¶2. (SBU) COMMENT:  We believe that Ukraine will eventually associate 
with the Accord and will provide an emission reduction target. 
Ukraine is interested in achieving a climate change agreement to 
supplant the Kyoto Protocol.  Ukraine has large amounts of unused 
carbon credits, and its antiquated industry gives it great potential 
to generate and sell additional carbon credits by improving 
efficiency and reducing emissions.  Nonetheless, given that Ukraine 
holds the second round of presidential elections on February 7, 
there is no certainty that Ukraine will complete the association 
process by January 31.  We will continue engaging our interlocutors 
in the government and will report any substantive developments.  End 
Comment.
