SUMMARY 
 
¶2.  (U) On January 25 we met with a Government of Nicaragua (GON) 
interagency team to discuss a renewal of the U.S.-Nicaragua Status 
of Forces Agreement (SOFA) for 2010.  The GON expressed a desire to 
renew the SOFA (within two weeks if possible), and proposed some 
modifications to the 2009 SOFA text for our consideration (see 
attached documents).  In reviewing its proposed changes for us, the 
GON reiterated a desire to establish essentially an "evergreen" 
SOFA text.  The Ministry of Defense representative also requested 
that the U.S. provide a more detailed lists of U.S. personnel 
transiting Nicaragua as part of operational activities.  We request 
Washington guidance in responding to the GON proposed text.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
GON Seeks SOFA Renewal for 2010, and Beyond... 
 
¶3.  (U) At the Foreign Ministry's request, on January 25 we met 
with a Government of Nicaragua (GON) interagency team comprised of 
representatives from the Foreign Ministry, the Ministry of Defense 
and the Nicaraguan Armed Forces (JAG), to discuss a renewal of the 
U.S.-Nicaragua Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) for 2010 
operational year (defined as 01 Jan to 31 Dec).  GON attendees 
were: Dr. Cesar Vega, Counselor, Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
(MINREX); Dr. Juan Umana, Ministry of Defense; Denis Palma, DirGen 
for Inter-institutional Cooperation, Ministry of Defense; Col. FNU 
Molina, Nicaraguan Army JAG Office; Renee Morales, Director, 
Americas Division, MINREX; Jane Mary Rivera, Americas Division, 
MINREX.  EMB Managua Attendees were:  Pol-Mil Officer Jesse Curtis; 
Senior Defense Official, COL Humberto Rodriguez; U.S. Military 
Group Commander, LTC Michael Regan and Senior Political Specialist 
Milena Lanzas (notetaker).  The GON expressed a desire to renew the 
SOFA (within two weeks if possible), and to this end, proposed some 
modifications to the 2009 SOFA text for our consideration (see 
attached documents).  The major changes include (1) moving the 
annual roster of operational activities from para 1 to an annex, 
(2) adding language regarding use of passports to enter and leave 
Nicaragua, (3) changing language related to inspection of items 
brought in to Nicaragua for use in operational activities, and (4) 
modification of the language related to importation of weapons.  In 
reviewing its proposed changes for us, the GON did reiterate a 
desire to work towards a SOFA text that would require minimal 
modification from year to year. 
 
¶4.  (U) In discussing the new language regarding passports (see 
changes listed in para below), MinDef's Palma stated that, while 
the SOFA text did not need to codify procedures, the GON would like 
"better lists" of U.S. personnel who were entering Nicaragua as 
part of these activities.  He asked if the USG would provide, 
particularly for ship visits, a complete list of U.S. personnel. 
We explained that the U.S. would not be able to provide a crew 
list, but would review our existing procedures and arrangements, 
(NOTE: These were developed in advance of the CONTINUING PROMISE 
2008 deployment of the USS KEARSARGE to Nicaragua END NOTE), to 
determine whether further adjustments were possible.  Referring to 
the new language in para 1 on notification of changes to 
activities, Palma also noted MINDEF's desire to define more clearly 
the time frames within which notification of program changes should 
occur.  He was clear that this not hold up agreement on the text 
itself, but seeks a "mutual understanding" on "adequate 
notification."  We asked the GON about changed language specific to 
inspections, to which the GON responded that it sought to ensure 
that paper documentation matched actual cargo and materiel and that 
health and safety regulations were respected.  They were clear that 
this change would not/not impose any new import tax or duty. 
 
ACTION REQUEST 
 
¶5.  (U) We have reviewed the suggested revisions and find them 
generally acceptable and reasonable; however, we request that 
Washington provide guidance on how to respond to the GON's proposal 
for the 2010 SOFA renewal.  Embassy Point of Contact for this issue 
is Political-Military Affairs Officer, Jesse Curtis (OpenNet/NIPR: 
CurtisJS@state.gov; SIPR: CurtisJS@state.sgov.gov; Tel: 
+505-2252-7128). 
 
GON Proposed Revised SOFA Text 
 
¶6.  (U) The GON's proposed changes to the SOFA text provided below 
are keyed to the attached, annotated English marked-up version of 
the SOFA.  For reference, we have also attached the marked-up 
Spanish original text provided by the GON and the 2010 Roster of 
Operational Activities in English and Spanish.  These documents 
will also be forwarded to State's WHA/CEN for dissemination and 
review. 
 
BEGIN List of changes in GON proposed SOFA text: 
 
-          Throughout text:  Replace "2009" with "2010." 
 
-          Change DipNote Number, as appropriate. 
 
Para 1 
 
-          Line 4 - Delete list of operational activities that 
begins in line 4, and replace with illustrative examples of the 
types of activities to be undertaken during the year.  "operational 
activities jointly agreed between Nicaragua and the United States, 
such as Exchanges, Medical Training Exercises, and visits for the 
purpose of Humanitarian Assistance,..." 

NOTE:  The GON proposal is to include the roster of operational 
activities as an Annex to the SOFA text.  The GON also desires to 
retain the current USMLGP-to-Nic Army channel to facilitate the 
Constitutionally-required annual notification to the National 
Assembly. 
 
-          Line 7 - Insert "coordinated" before 
"military-to-military." 
 
-          Line 9 - Insert phrase "and which are delineated in the 
attached Annex" after "2010 operational activities." 
 
-          At end of para, insert the sentence, "In the event that 
changes are required for certain activities, or to personnel or 
equipment related to these activities, notification of changes 
should be made with adequate advance notification."  The GON seeks 
to further clarify the mechanism for making changes to planned 
activities. 
NOTE:  The Ministry of Defense representative expressed a desire to 
define more concretely the phrase, "adequate advance notification." 

Para 2 
 
-          Line 8 - after the phrase "enter and exit Nicaragua 
with", insert the phrase "a passport, or in its absence, with..." 
NOTE: The GON prefers that USG personnel covered under the SOFA 
enter and depart Nicaragua using a passport.  However, they 
recognized the USG need for flexibility in this regard and retained 
the "Mil ID and orders" provision.  They did seek to clarify that 
this option would not/not apply to non-uniformed military 
personnel. 
 
-          Last Line - replace "carry" with "bring in" 
NOTE: GON sought to correct the meaning of the Spanish text, 
replacing "portar" (to carry) with "introducir" (to introduce/bring 
in). This reflects the GON's position that USG personnel should not 
bear arms while in Nicaragua, but would be permitted to bring in 
weapons, which would be securely stored during their stay in 
country, thus permit on-alert units to comply with their 
requirement that their arms be immediately available in the event 
of emergency deployment to another location. 
 
Para 3 
 
-          Line 2 - Delete "inspection and" from text. 
NOTE: GON asserts its right to inspect.  Not for customs or duty 
purposes, but for health, safety and quarantine purposes.  Example 
given was, right to inspect incoming medicines to verify that 
formulary is correct, in accordance with submitted documentation 
and in compliance with GON standards on medicines. 
 
-          Line 3 - Insert "in accordance with applicable 
Nicaraguan legislation" after the phrase "exemption from taxation." 
 
Para 4, Line 1; 
 
Para 9, Line 5; 
 
Para 12, Lines 3, 4 and 5 
 
-          Replace "shall" with "will" 
NOTE: This reflects a change in the Spanish from "deber + 
infinitive verb" to future tense.  We believe this change to the 
Spanish weakens the obligatory sense conveyed by the 
English-version "shall." 
 
Para 9 
 
-          Last Line - At the end of the para, insert the phrase, 
"with the understanding that all procedures and processes will 
conform to applicable legislation of Nicaragua." 
 
Change Date on DipNote, as appropriate 
 
Add Annex, "Roster of 2010 Operational Activities" 
NOTE: This Annex is attached in English and Spanish. 
 
END List of changes in GON proposed SOFA text.
