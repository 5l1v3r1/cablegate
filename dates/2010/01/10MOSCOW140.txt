SUMMARY 
 
¶1. (C)  During a January 13 discussion with U/S Burns, four 
prominent Russian intellectuals agreed the current Russian 
leadership is not successfully tackling the immense economic 
and social challenges facing the country.  Despite Medvedev's 
progressive "modernization" rhetoric, vested interests that 
profit from Russia's continued dependence on resource rents 
will likely block genuine reform.  The GOR's crackdown on 
public protests stems from fear of a repeat of the Orange 
Revolution and concerns about the reliability of the security 
forces.  Putin remains the dominant force in the GOR with the 
resources and cadres to back him; on foreign policy, Medvedev 
is using different tactics for the same policies, which are 
simultaneously friendly and hostile to the West.  All agreed 
Putin will most likely return to the presidency in 2012.  End 
summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  On January 13, the Charge hosted a discussion on 
Russia's current political and economic situation for U/S 
Burns, NSC Senior Director for Russia McFaul, and EUR DAS 
Russell with XXXXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXX. 
 
MODERNIZATION/REFORM 

¶3. (C)  XXXXXXXXXXXX said the business community is giving up on 
Medvedev's promises of modernization and noted that Putin's 
presidency had also begun with ambitious targets to be met by 
2010 -- known as the Gref plan -- only 27% of which have been 
implemented.  While there is widespread acknowledgment of the 
need for reform, the elite who control the economy are 
content with the status quo, in which they receive a secure 
slice of the pie based on their control of rents gained from 
natural resource exports.  Reform, even if it promises to 
increase dramatically the size of the pie, is not in their 
interest if it threatens their slice.  As a result, there is 
a strong bias towards inertia.  XXXXXXXXXXXX seconded this analysis but said the problem is systemic and not tied to the Putin 
government, noting that dependence on natural resources (a 
feature of Russia's economy for 300 years) destroys the 
demand for modernization.  Moreover, the current generation 
of leaders believes oil prices will stay high so there will 
be sufficient rents to sustain them.  XXXXXXXXXXXX said another 
factor mitigating against reform is that Putin's team 
believes the global economic crisis will end in 2011, 
triggering a resurgence in oil prices.  In the meantime, the 
government will borrow and spend to keep the economy going. 
 
POLITICAL APATHY, OFFICIAL FEAR 
 
¶4. (C)  Despite the lack of demand for reform and 
modernization and widespread political apathy, XXXXXXXXXXXX
contended the ruling elite is fundamentally insecure about 
its position.  Citing opinion surveys, she claimed that even 
among high-ranking officials there is widespread disgust for 
government corruption and support for reform, especially rule 
of law, suggesting a strong, silent constituency for change 
exists.  She also claimed that in last fall's municipal 
elections, even in central Moscow (home to bureaucrats and 
other beneficiaries of the status quo) the ruling United 
Russia party received only 12%, while 47% of the ballots were 
spoiled intentionally, i.e. people opted for "none of the 
above."  (The official results showed overwhelming support 
for United Russia.)  Moreover, the catastrophes caused by 
ageing infrastructure (such as the collapse of the Siberian 
hydro station last summer) and imminent regional budget 
crises which threaten to cut off salaries to teachers and 
other public workers could also serve as triggers for 
instability. 
 
¶5. (C)  XXXXXXXXXXXX concurred, noting the leadership remains 
frightened of a repeat of the Orange revolution in Ukraine, 
which is why there is a ban on public demonstrations.  In 
addition, local police are not trusted to quell disorder, so 
when there were large protests in Vladivostok, special police 
were flown in from Moscow and the Interior Ministry uses 
police from surrounding regions to deal with protests in the 
capital.  XXXXXXXXXXXX said that, despite the bad press abroad, the 
rough treatment of demonstrations has succeeded in sending a 
strong message to students: if you participate in this 
activity, you could get beaten up and/or spend time in jail. 
XXXXXXXXXXXX said that, as a result of the stifled political 
climate and sense of stagnation in the economy, a large 
percentage of people are voting with their feet (or trying 
to) by seeking to move abroad. 
 
TANDEM: PUTIN CALLS THE SHOTS 
 
¶6. (C)  XXXXXXXXXXXX said the baseline assumption is that Putin 
intends to return to the presidency in 2012 and remain there 
until 2024.  He noted that Medvedev had made some important 
moves independent of Putin, but they were not sufficient to 
suggest he could become Putin's rival.  XXXXXXXXXXXX said 
Medvedev is not prepared for a struggle for power; he has not 
created institutions to support his position and he does not 
have a pool of cadres to work for him.  In his first year in 
office, he has placed fewer than 1000 loyalists into the 
government.  Putin, with his protgs in the security 
services, could fill 7000 jobs overnight if he needed to, 
XXXXXXXXXXXX said. 
 
¶7. (C)  On foreign policy, XXXXXXXXXXXX said Putin's paradigm 
remains in force whereby Russia acts as both a friend and a 
foe of the West and NATO continues to be demonized.  The 
tactics, she said, have been modified under Medvedev, but he 
has no leverage on the overall strategy.  Putin, according to 
XXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXX, continues to exercise control on 
foreign policy through FM Lavrov and his own foreign policy 
staff, led by Yuriy Ushakov.  XXXXXXXXXXXXadded that Putin 
probably did not even see the need for a "reset" in relations 
with the U.S. since in his mind there was no problem in the 
relationship.  Putin, he said, continues to blame the U.S. 
for Russia's failure to enter the WTO and for destabilizing 
the relationship by rolling out plans for missile defense. 
Putin's goal, according to XXXXXXXXXXXX, is to have Medvedev 
change as little as possible pending Putin's return to the 
presidency. 
 
¶8. (U) U/S Burns has cleared this message.
