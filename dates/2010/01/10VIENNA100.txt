¶1. Polchief raised reftel A points January 26 with Bruno 
Bilek, MFA Deputy Director for East Asia.  Bilek said MFA 
Secretary General Johannes Kyrle will represent the GOA at 
the London Conference.  He said Kyrle will be prepared to 
announce Austria's contributions to the Afghanistan mission 
if an opportunity arises during the conference, but it is not 
clear whether that will be the case.  The GOA did not request 
a speaking slot for the event. 
 
¶2. Bilek noted that the GOA is preparing to send police 
trainers to the EUPOL mission in Afghanistan and to provide 
funding for a number of UN and OSCE-related projects (reftel 
B).  On January 25, the Council of Ministers designated 1 
million Euros in leftover disaster relief funds for 
humanitarian aid for Afghanistan (the remaining 2 million 
Euros were designated for Haiti).  Bilek said the GOA 
supports the reintegration program and is considering the 
possibility of contributing to the Peace and Reintegration 
Trust Fund.  It is not clear whether the leftover disaster 
relief funds, which are earmarked for humanitarian 
assistance, can be used for the Trust Fund.  If not, the GOA 
could make a contribution from other sources if funding is 
available, he said. 
 
¶3. The GOA is also supporting an Afghanistan Implementation 
Conference to be held February 25-28 in Baden, near Vienna. 
Princeton University's Liechtenstein Institute on 
Self-Determination is organizing the event, which will be 
designed as a follow-up to the London Conference.  FM 
Spindelegger is scheduled to attend.
