SUBJECT: CPA DAY CELEBRATIONS IN YAMBIO 
 
¶1.  Summary:  On January 19, the Government of Southern Sudan 
(GOSS) and Government of National Unity (GNU) hosted the fifth 
anniversary of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) in Yambio, 
Western Equatoria.  Unlike the previous years' celebrations in 
Malakal and Wau, there were no reports of security incidents.  GNU 
President Omar Al-Bashir, GOSS President Salva Kiir, Minister for 
SPLA Affairs Nhial Deng Nhial, Governor Gemma Nunu Kumba and others 
spoke positively about the need for full implementation of the CPA, 
free and fair elections and a peaceful transition regardless of the 
results of the referendum.  End Summary. 
 
 
 
¶2.  On January 19, GNU officials, GOSS representatives and foreign 
diplomats gathered in Yambio, Western Equatoria to mark the fifth 
anniversary of the signing of the CPA.  The speeches made by 
Al-Bashir, Kiir, Nhial and others were overwhelmingly positive. 
The event commenced with a speech by Governor Gemma Nunu Kumba who 
highlighted the many development, security and gender issues facing 
her state, Western Equatoria, as well as Sudan.  She blamed the 
GOSS and the international community for not doing enough to rid 
Southern Sudan and especially Western Equatoria of the Lord's 
Resistance Army (LRA).  She praised the Sudan People's Liberation 
Movement (SPLM) for increasing the percentage for female 
representation to 35 percent and called on the GNU and other 
parties to require the same throughout Sudan.  Finally, she called 
on the GNU to reimburse Western Equatoria for the 40 percent they 
owed the state for the CPA celebrations, citing their lack of 
reimbursement only further exacerbated underdevelopment in the 
state. 
 
 
 
¶3.  Minister of SPLA Affairs Nhial Deng Nhial spoke on behalf of 
the GOSS and stressed the importance of these CPA celebrations in 
the development of different states in the south.  Each year the 
celebrations have focused on a different city in a different state 
to ensure development throughout Southern Sudan.  Nhial went on to 
commend the efforts of the local government against the LRA threat. 
He stated that elections must be free and fair, although he fears 
like many that they won't be.  He explained that the GOSS is 
committed to ensuring that the National Congress Party (NCP) is not 
able to disrupt elections in the south.  He concluded stating that 
the GOSS first, second and last priority is peace. 
 
 
 
¶4. Kiir and al-Bashir called on the population of Sudan to stay 
committed to CPA implementation throughout 2010.  They both pledged 
to work together in the remaining time to ensure that Sudan is set 
up for a peaceful transition regardless of the outcome of the 
referendum.  Both Kiir and al-Bashir committed to ending LRA 
activity in the region and offered they assistance to the people of 
Western Equatoria.  Kiir called on the people of Southern Sudan to 
help consolidate peace and unity throughout Southern Sudan. 
Al-Bashir said that if Southern Sudan opts for separation, 
"Khartoum will be the first to recognize and support the new state 
of Southern Sudan."  However, he also added that the goal of the 
NCP is to secure unity for Sudan. 
 
 
 
¶5. Comment:  The celebration and speeches were largely positive. 
Al-Bashir's speech was not only positive, but surprising in how 
open he was on the referendum.  That said, it remains to be seen 
whether the National Congress Party will be willing to accept the 
result of the elections and referendum once the votes are in.
