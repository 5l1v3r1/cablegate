SUBJECT: NEW MINISTER OF RURAL REHABILITATION AND DEVELOPMENT 
JARULLAH MANSOORI COMMITS TO DEEPENING PARTNERSHIP WITH U.S. 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: In a January 26 courtesy call on Jarullah Mansoori 
to congratulate him on his recent confirmation as MRRD Minister, 
Ambassador Eikenberry solicited Mansoori's initial views and plans 
for the ministry, provided a brief overview of the President's 
Afghanistan-Pakistan strategy and expressed interest in the future 
direction of MRRD programs, particularly the National Solidarity 
Program (NSP).  Referring to his recent speech to Parliament, 
Mansoori noted his commitment to tackle corruption at all levels and 
to support Afghan women.  He also repeatedly expressed strong 
commitment to MRRD-implemented national programs (with key national 
program heads present), and said he sees a strong role for the 
ministry to play in the areas of governance and regional 
cooperation.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Mansoori sought details on U.S. views on reintegration and 
reconciliation, sub-national governance, and requested a copy of and 
follow-up discussions on the recently announced U.S. 
Afghanistan-Pakistan regional strategy.  In addition to committing 
to engage regularly, Ambassador Eikenberry indicated that he would 
place a call to Senator Kerry, a key supporter of NSP (who recently 
asked what we were doing to ensure the NSP would remain a successful 
local governance program under the new MRRD leadership) and would 
invite Mansoori to accompany him on a future field visit.

¶3. (SBU) Mansoori was confirmed in Karzai's second round cabinet 
submission on January 16 (squeaking through with the minimum 113 
votes of 224) as Minister of Rural Rehabilitation and Development. 
Lawmakers had alleged that Mansoori lied about his age in order to 
be eligible for the post (rumors suggest that he is 31 years old - 
four years short of the age required in the Afghan constitution), 
but he was approved despite the discrepancies.  Mansoori, associated 
with Tajik powerbrokers, is considered to be a political pick and a 
close ally of Marshal Mohammad Qasim Fahim, Karzai's First Vice 
President. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Mansoori noted that he was born in a remote, rural village 
in northern Takhar province, and that his father was a tribal leader 
in Badakhshan province and a Northern Alliance freedom fighter. 
Based on his rural and refugee experiences in Pakistan, he claimed 
no particularly strong political or ethnic affiliations.  Prior to 
his appointment as MRRD Minister, Mansoori served as an advisor to 
Minister of Interior Hanif Atmar while the latter was MRRD Minister, 
as an advisor to former Minister of Justice Abdul Rahim Karimi, and 
as Deputy General of the Afghan National Environmental Protection 
Agency (NEPA).  Mansoori cited his presentation to Parliament, where 
he made two promises: 1) fighting corruption at all levels (he noted 
that he walked into MRRD, and does not own a car or maintain a 
personal bank account abroad); and 2) restoring the rightful place 
of women in society who have paid disproportionally in the 
sacrifices Afghans have made to date.

COMMITMENT TO NATIONAL PROGRAMS

¶5. (SBU) Contrary to rumors that he would scale back 
MRRD-implemented national programs, Mansoori mentioned his strong 
support for the NSP, National Rural Access Program (NRAP), 
Afghanistan Rural Enterprise Development Program (AREDP), and 
National Area-Based Development Program (NABDP), and the Afghanistan 
Institute for Rural Development (AIRD).  He stressed he would be 
guided by two principles: 1) national inclusion -- allowing 
participation of the Afghan people to develop a sense of ownership 
in Ministry-led programs; and 2) a focus on sustainability and 
capacity-building.  He thanked the U.S. for its generous support to 
date and leadership, and emphasized that MRRD should not be 
personality-driven but is an established ministry with systems in 
place which need to be strengthened.  Ambassador Eikenberry 
reiterated U.S. commitment to strengthening sub-national governance, 
noting challenges at the district level where it is often weak or 
non-existent.  MRRD is a critical partner in this regard to 
strengthen the link between the central, provincial, district, and 
community levels, he stated. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Ambassador Eikenberry emphasized the significant shift in 
President Obama's strategy that focuses more on building the Afghan 
government's ability to connect with the population, indicating that 
the USG plans to channel significantly more assistance through the 
government's budget, compared to the past year.  (Note: The U.S. aim 
is to increase the percentage of U.S. assistance that flows directly 
through GIRoA institutions to 40 percent by FY 2011.  End Note.) 
The Ambassador solicited Mansoori's views on how to strengthen 
national programs, expressing concern about the balance of power 
between the executive, legislative (Parliament and Provincial 
 
KABUL 00000352  002 OF 002 
 
 
Councils, with its election delays), and the local level (including 
Community Development Councils formed under NSP).  The Minister said 
that money currently is allocated to line ministries, with little to 
no operating budget for provincial/district governors, thus 
weakening service delivery.  There is no quick solution in sight, 
with debates continuing within GIRoA on how to address these issues. 
 Ambassador Eikenberry specifically highlighted the important 
interface between MRRD and the Independent Directorate of Local 
Governance (IDLG) in this regard.

REGIONAL STABILITY & REINTEGRATION/RECONCILIATION ROLE

¶7. (SBU) Turning to regional stability, Mansoori expressed interest 
in the U.S. Afghanistan-Pakistan strategy and requested a copy for 
review and follow-up discussions.  Mansoori confirmed that MRRD has 
a role in strengthening regional cooperation and solicited U.S. 
views on how supportive the U.S will be on reintegration and 
reconciliation.  The Ambassador expressed full U.S. support, but 
with the following principles in mind: that the overarching 
principle is that it be Afghan-led, adding that the U.S. will 
support the process both politically and with programs.  Citing 
President Karzai, the Ambassador reiterated the 
reintegration/reconciliation pre-conditions, to wit that the Taliban 
renounce terrorism, renounce violence against the Afghan and 
international communities, respect the Afghan constitution and laws 
of Afghanistan, and that no territory (so-called "safe areas") be 
ceded to the Taliban.  The U.S. is optimistic, but a 'carrot' and 
'stick' approach is required, he stated. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Comment: While commentators have raised questions about 
Mansoori's qualifications and experience to manage a Ministry of 
this magnitude, this initial meeting provides grounds for cautious 
optimism and a renewed commitment to deepening our existing strong 
partnership.  End Comment.
