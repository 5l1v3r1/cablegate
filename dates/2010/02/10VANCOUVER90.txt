SUBJECT: Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics: Situation Report #11 
 
¶1.      (SBU) The following report provides security-related 
information for the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic Games as of noon 
on February 21, 2010. Please visit the following link for 
additional classified reporting: 
https://nol.nctc.sgov.gov/ng/cgi-bin/nctcHome .cgi?event=Vancouver_2 
¶010. The interagency USG Joint Operations Center can be contacted 
on a 24-hour basis at 604-692-2509, ext 4013. 
 
 
 
¶2.      (U//FOUO//LES) Officials are currently unaware of any 
specific, credible threats to the Games. Though the frequency of 
organized demonstrations has diminished since February 15, ad hoc 
protest activity at event and public locations remains a concern. 
Canadian security officials indicate anti-Olympics groups may stage 
limited demonstrations as the Games draw to a close. 
 
 
 
SECURITY ISSUES 
 
 
 
¶3.      (U//FOUO//LES) U.S.-Canada Hockey Game Could Spur Public 
Disorder - Local law enforcement authorities are concerned over the 
potentially contentious nature of today's U.S. - Canada match - to 
be held at 4:40 at Canada Hockey Place - and its impact on public 
order. Canada Hockey Place will cease liquor sales early in the 
third period to address crowd control issues. The venue is located 
within blocks of Vancouver's entertainment district, primary 
pedestrian corridors, and many hotels; authorities expect a charged 
atmosphere among fans with implications for the aforementioned 
areas. 
 
¶4.      (U//FOUO//LES) Games Draw Record Numbers of Revelers - 
Local press report a recent, general increase in crowds - 150,000 
on the evening of February 20 - and public revelry on Vancouver's 
streets.  Adequate law enforcement resources appear on hand for the 
growing number of generally well-behaved revelers in the downtown 
area, though drinking in public and criminal behavior is not 
tolerated. As a preventative measure, the Vancouver Police 
Department (VPD) asked the B.C. Liquor and Licensing Branch for 
assistance with a 7 p.m. closing time for public and private liquor 
stores in the downtown area this weekend. 
 
 
 
Protests: 
 
 
 
¶5.      (U) February 20 Protest Activity - The peaceful "Rally for 
National Housing" drew 200 to 300 activists who remained near the 
Art Gallery and dispersed without incident by 2 p.m. Local law 
enforcement was commensurate with the nature of the event. 
 
 
 
¶6.      (U) Current Protest Activity - There are no 
Olympics-related protests scheduled for today, February 21. 
 
 
 
¶7.      (SBU) Anticipated Protest Activity - Bicyclists and skaters 
plan to participate in a "Critical Mass Bike Ride" departing from 
the Vancouver Art Gallery around 6 p.m. on February 26. This 
recurring event is taking place as regularly scheduled and is not 
anti-Olympics in nature; however, the route is unknown and could 
affect the Men's Hockey Semi-Final game at 6:30 p.m. at Canada 
Hockey Place. Minor traffic disruptions are expected. 
 
¶8.      (SBU) A "Games Over! Resistance Lives!" demonstration is 
scheduled to occur from 1 to 3 p.m. on February 28 at the 
intersection of Smithe and Cambie streets. The event is advertised 
as a "noisy public festival to celebrate our communities and our 
resistance" 
 
 
 
Incidents: 
 
 
 
¶9.      (U) Violent Altercation Near USA House and Popular Tourist 
Area - VPD reports a 30 year-old Vancouver man is recovering in the 
hospital after he was "slashed" during an altercation in the 1100 
block of Granville Street at 2 a.m. on February 20. A 23-year-old 
Vancouver man, known to police, was arrested and is facing a charge 
of aggravated assault.  The VPD Robbery/Assault Squad is continuing 
the investigation.  The incident occurred a short distance from the 
USA House and in an area heavily frequented by pedestrians. 
 
 
 
Threats: 
 
 
 
¶10.  (SBU) At this time, there are no known specific, credible 
transnational terrorist threats against the Vancouver Olympics. 
 
 
 
SECURITY OPERATIONS 
 
 
¶11.  (SBU) Other than scheduled USOC and team movements, no major 
Olympics-related security operations have transpired during this 
reporting period. 
 
 
 
¶12.  (SBU) DHS Secretary Napolitano, Health and Human Services 
Secretary Sebelius, and Ambassador to the USUN Susan Rice will 
visit Vancouver from February 25 to March 1 and attend the closing 
ceremonies. 
 
 
 
PUBLIC AFFAIRS/PUBLIC DIPLOMACY 
 
 
 
¶13.  There is no significant information or activity to report. 
 
 
 
CONSULAR ISSUES 
 
 
 
¶14.   No significant cases to report. 
 
 
 
¶15. Consular staff on notice regarding potential issues related to 
USA-Canada men's hockey game this PM
