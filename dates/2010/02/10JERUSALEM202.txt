SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (02/03): Prime Minister Fayyad 
gives remarks at conference in Israel 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
-------------The dailies front page news on Palestinian Authority 
(PA) Prime Minister Salam Fayyad attending the annual conference 
organized by the Strategic Studies Institute in Herzliya. Fayyad is 
quoted saying that Israel must begin to "roll back" its occupation 
of the Palestinian territories, starting with ending the incursions 
into the West Bank, to convince Palestinians it wants a peace deal 
that would give them statehood. PA official daily Al-Hayat Al-Jadida 
reports that Fayyad said that East Jerusalem is Palestinian land 
that was occupied in 1967 and must become the capital of Palestine. 
 
Maan news agency reports on Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri 
condemning Fayyad's participation in the conference, saying "The 
Palestinian Authority's cooperation with Israel reached a political 
level, and this is a serious indicator that the PA has connected its 
projects with Israeli interests and policies." 
 
The dailies report that PA President Mahmoud Abbas stated in a joint 
press conference with Spanish Foreign Minister Moratinos in Ramallah 
yesterday that the PA is still reviewing the proposals submitted by 
Special Envoy George Mitchell. Abbas reiterated that the 
Palestinians are committed to the peace process and the two state 
solution, and that the settlement activities must stop. In related 
news, Al-Hayat Al-Jadida reports that President Abbas will meet with 
Egyptian President Mubarak on Friday in Egypt to discuss the 
proposals submitted by Special Envoy Mitchell regarding the 
resumption of negotiations with Israel. 
 
The dailies run reports citing "well informed" French sources saying 
that Special Envoy Mitchell asked French and European officials to 
exert pressure on President Abbas to accept the US proposal for the 
resumption of negotiations. 
 
Al-Quds front pages news on the new UNRWA Commissioner General 
Filippo Grandi noting after a visit to Gaza yesterday that Israel 
bears huge responsibility for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. 
------------ 
BLOCK QUOTE: 
------------ 
Al-Quds runs an editorial under the title "Negotiations Are Not a 
Goal" which states that Palestinian-Israeli negotiations are not a 
goal, but a means to achieve peace in the region. The writer 
believes that the more pressure the United States exerts on the PA 
to resume negotiations, the more it loses its credibility. The 
author argues that in order to ensure the resumption of 
negotiations, the U.S. has to lay out a clear policy regarding 
settlement activities.
