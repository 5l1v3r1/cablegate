SUBJECT: INTRODUCING BULGARIA'S NEW DEFENSE AND FOREIGN 
MINISTERS 
 
Classified By: AMB James Warlick for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1.  (C)  Summary:  Bulgaria's new Minister of Foreign Affairs 
-- former Defense Minister Nikolay Mladenov -- is a dynamic, 
strategic thinker who will put a young, modern face on 
Bulgarian foreign relations.  To replace Mladenov at the MOD, 
PM Borissov has tapped Deputy Defense Minister Anyu Angelov, 
a respected military insider with 40 years of experience but 
lacking the charisma and vision of his predecessor.  End 
Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Former Foreign Minister Rumiana Jeleva's failed 
European Commissioner bid and subsequent resignation on 
January 19 forced Prime Minister Boyko Borissov to initiate 
an impromptu cabinet reshuffle.  Lacking an appropriate 
alternative, Borissov moved his talented and dynamic Defense 
Minister, Nickolay Mladenov, to the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs (MFA) and placed Deputy Minister of Defense Anyu 
Angelov into the top spot at MOD.  The two were confirmed in 
their new positions on January 27. 
 
¶3.  (C) Mladenov, 37, is one of the youngest and brightest 
stars in Borissov's cabinet.  A former Member of the European 
Parliament (MEP), Mladenov was the first person to become 
Minister of Defense without military experience.  Mladenov is 
modern-thinking and western oriented.  He is dynamic, with a 
famous work ethic and the strategic vision to challenge 
entrenched interests inside the military and his ministry. 
While Minister of Defense, Mladenov made deepening the United 
States-Bulgaria relationship his top priority and worked to 
expand deployments to Afghanistan and find creative new uses 
for the joint bases.  While he made progress, much of his 
time and attention was drawn into cleaning up the legal, 
structural, and budgetary mess left behind by the previous 
Minister.  We can expect Mladenov to take his reformist, 
transatlanic attitude with him to the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs (MFA).  It is rumored that he will continue to have 
input into important security decisions, though how this will 
work in practice is not yet clear.  He will undoubtedly 
represent Bulgaria well in his new role and will put a young, 
modern face on Bulgaria. 
 
¶4.  (C) Taking over at the MOD will be Anyu Angelov, 67, a 
retired Lieutenant-General with a distinguished career in the 
Bulgarian Army.  In his more than 40 years of service, he 
reached the position of Deputy Chief of General Staff in 
1994, and served as Defense Attache to the United Kingdom 
from 1997-2000.  While Angelov has extensive military 
experience, he lacks Mladenov's vision and charisma and, due 
to his long military career, may be less willing to tackle 
entrenched interests.  Angelov is detail-oriented and has had 
success in hammering out complicated changes to rules and 
regulations.  He first gained prominence inside the MOD when 
he was put in charge of the working group that developed the 
first Defense Law in 1995 and played an instrumental role in 
the development of several other important documents 
including the Military Service Personnel Regulations and 
Armed Forces Regulations (1996-1997) and Law on Bulgaria's 
National Security Forces Reserve (2002). 
 
¶5.  (C)  Comment:  The MOD's loss of Mladenov is the MFA's 
gain.  With his reformist bent, Mladenov is likely to embark 
on a full-scale review and restructuring of a demoralized 
MFA, which has long had difficulty attracting young talent. 
At Defense, Angelov has big shoes to fill.  The selection of 
his close advisors and his replacement as Deputy Minister 
will signal if he is prepared to challenge the status quo and 
push for needed reform.
