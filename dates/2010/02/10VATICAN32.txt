SUBJECT: POPE APPEALS TO IRAQI GOVERNMENT TO PROTECT CHRISTIANS 
 
¶1.   (U) In a letter made public on February 25 in the 
semi-official Vatican daily, L'Osservatore Romano, Pope Benedict 
XVI asked Iraqi PM al-Maliki to do "everything possible" to 
increase security around Christian places of worship during the 
Eastern-rite Christian Christmas season. The original letter, 
signed by Vatican Secretary of State, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, 
was dated January 2. Editorial comment added that the Pope - 
currently attending the annual spiritual retreat for the Roman 
Curia - was upset by reports this week of attacks against 
Christians in the Mosul region, hence the publication of the 
letter at this time. 
 
 
 
¶2.   (U) Apart from the appeal to the Iraqi government to 
protect Christians, Pope Benedict also expressed his sympathy 
over the deaths and injuries incurred by the bombing of 
government sites and mosques in Baghdad in late December and 
January.  The letter was prefaced by references to al-Maliki's 
visit to the Vatican back in 2008 and by the Holy See's 
insistence at the time that cooperation among ethnic and 
religious groups was the only way for Iraq's "moral and civil" 
reconstruction to go forward.  The letter also recalled the 
Pope's call for respect for freedom of worship. 
 
 
 
¶3.   (U) In what is turning into a full-court-press by the Holy 
See, the nunciature in Baghdad followed the Pope by issuing a 
public statement on February 24 decrying the targeting of 
Christians in Iraq, based solely on their religious beliefs or 
ethnicity. The statement said Christians have paid a "high 
price" and that their "indisputable right to full citizenship" 
is being trampled.  The nunciature called for the international 
community to maintain pressure "so that the violence and 
discrimination ends immediately."  The archbishops of Mosul and 
Kirkuk made further public statements decrying the violence 
forcing Christians out of the region. More on the letter and the 
nuncio's statement is available on Embassy Vatican's Community 
Blog: http://vatican.state.gov/nea/iraq/. 
 
 
 
¶4.   (SBU) Comment: It is relatively rare for the Pope to make a 
direct request to a foreign government, and even rarer for it to 
be given such prominence. The Vatican's decision to publish the 
letter some 6 weeks after the fact, plus the statement from the 
nunciature, show the Holy See's increasing alarm over the 
ongoing security problems in Iraq in general, and for Christians 
in particular.  End comment.
