¶1. (U) This is an action request(paras 2 and 3). 
 
¶2. (U) USUN is instructed to seek Council consensus towards a 
UN Security Council Presidential Statement (PRST) on Iraq 
containing the elements outlined in the non-paper in para 3. 
USUN should keep Washington informed on the progress of 
negotiations and seek further guidance as needed. 
 
¶3. (U) Begin Non-paper: 
 
--The Security Council welcomes the letter sent by the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs of Iraq on 18 January 2010 which 
reiterates that the Government of Iraq supports the 
international non-proliferation regime and complies with 
disarmament treaties and other relevant international 
instruments and is committed to taking additional steps to 
comply with non-proliferation and disarmament standards, and 
has also committed to inform the Security Council, IAEA and 
other relevant agencies on progress made towards implementing 
those measures in accordance with the Government of Iraq,s 
constitutional and legislative procedures and in compliance 
with international norms. 
--The Security Council warmly welcomes Iraq,s accession to 
the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, 
Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on 
their Destruction, becoming the 186th State party on 12 
February 2009. 
--The Security Council also welcomes that Iraq has signed the 
Additional Protocol to the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement 
with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and that 
the Additional Protocol is currently before Parliament for 
ratification, as is the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban 
Treaty.  The Security Council further notes that, consistent 
with Iraqi law, Iraq has agreed to apply the Additional 
Protocol provisionally, pending its entry into force. 
--Reaffirming the need to be assured of Iraq,s peaceful 
intentions, the Security Council requests that the IAEA 
inform the Council as soon as possible regarding the quality 
of Iraq,s safeguards-related cooperation with the IAEA, 
including whether Iraq is implementing provisionally the 
Additional Protocol pending entry into force. 
--Following such a determination by the IAEA, the Security 
Council would be prepared to review, with a view towards 
lifting, the restrictions in UNSCR 687 and 707 related to 
weapons of mass destruction and civil nuclear activities. 
End Non-paper.
