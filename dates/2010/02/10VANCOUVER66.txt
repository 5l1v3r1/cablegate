SUBJECT: Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics: Situation Report #4 
 
¶1.      (SBU) The following report provides security-related 
information for the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic Games as of noon 
on February 14, 2010. Please visit the following link for 
additional classified reporting: 
https://nol.nctc.sgov.gov/ng/cgi-bin/nctcHome .cgi?event=Vancouver_2 
¶010. The interagency USG Joint Operations Center can be contacted 
on a 24-hour basis at 604-692-2509, ext 4013. 
 
 
 
SECURITY ISSUES 
 
 
 
Olympic Protests: 
 
 
 
¶2.      (SBU) February 13 Protest Activity - Approximately 250 
individuals - many of them affiliated with so-called "Black Bloc" 
anarchist groups - engaged in acts of vandalism during the "Heart 
Attack" march, which was apparently part of a broader "2010 
Autonomous Day of Action." One group threw red paint at the Hudson 
Bay Company store at Granville and Robson Streets and smashed two 
windows with a newspaper box. In a similar incident, the Toronto 
Dominion Bank sustained damage to one of its street-level windows. 
Newspaper boxes, rubbish bins, and caf???? furniture were also 
dragged 
into the street at various locations to obstruct traffic.  Broken 
windows and spray paint graffiti on cars and buses were reported at 
other locations.  Vancouver Police arrested at least seven for 
attempted assault at West Georgia and Cardero Streets. The Lions 
Gate Bridge was also temporarily closed to vehicular traffic due to 
reports that protestors were moving in that direction.  The bridge 
was never affected and later reopened. 
 
¶3.      (SBU) Current Protest Activity - The 19th Annual Women's 
March will take place from noon to 4 p.m. today.  The march will 
begin at the Carnegie Community Centre and proceed through Downtown 
Eastside.  This event is not Olympics-related, and anti-Olympics 
protesters are discouraged from attending. Vancouver's 36th Annual 
Chinese New Year Parade, expected to draw up to 20,000 people, 
coincides with the march. 
 
 
 
¶4.      (SBU) Anticipated Protest Activity - Another "2010 
Autonomous Day of Action" is scheduled for Monday, February 15.  As 
evidenced in Saturday's demonstrations, small groups of anarchists 
may engage in acts of vandalism and confrontations with local law 
enforcement.  An "Anti-War and Anti-Militarization Moving 
Spectacle" will take place at the Vancouver Art Gallery (Georgia 
Street side) at 6 p.m. 
 
 
 
Incidents: 
 
 
 
¶5.      (SBU) Subject Detained at Opening Ceremonies - An 
individual who attempted to enter the International Olympic 
Committee presidential box inside BC Place during Friday's Opening 
Ceremonies using fake accreditation was detained. While the motive 
is unclear, the subject is not a known activist and did not appear 
to have malicious intent. 
 
 
 
Threats: 
 
¶6.      (SBU) At this time, there are no known specific, credible 
terrorist threats against the Vancouver Olympics. 
 
 
 
¶7.      (SBU/LES) Alleged threat to Olympics deemed non-credible - 
According to Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) information, 
Vancouver police were notified that an inmate at Pinellas County 
Jail, Florida, conversed with a prisoner of Arabic origin regarding 
a possible terrorist attack on February 20 involving an aircraft 
flown into the main area of the Olympics in Vancouver (NFI). The 
FBI ascertained no individuals matching the alleged Arabic inmate 
are presently incarcerated. This threat is considered non-credible. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SECURITY OPERATIONS 
 
 
 
¶8.      (SBU) U.S. Vice President Joe Biden is scheduled to attend 
several Olympic events in Vancouver today. The Vice President is 
scheduled to depart Vancouver on Monday, February 15. 
 
 
 
 
 
PUBLIC AFFAIRS/PUBLIC DIPLOMACY 
 
¶9.      Public affairs staff continued to assist White House 
advance with setting up press interviews, with Vice President Biden 
taping one interview with NBC Saturday evening, and another with 
CBS on Sunday morning.  The Globe and Mail's Jane Tabor has 
requested an interview with Ambassador Jacobson for early next 
week.  No press inquiries on Olympic-specific topics. 
 
 
 
CONSULAR ISSUES 
 
 
 
¶10.  There is no significant information or activity to report. 
 
POLITICAL/GENERAL ISSUES 
 
 
 
¶11.  Vice-President Biden and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen 
Harper held a bi-lateral meeting Saturday.  They discussed issues 
ranging from security to the economy and the upcoming G8 and G20 
summits. (Will be reported septel). 
 
 
 
¶12.  Unseasonably warm weather conditions, fog, and heavy rain 
continue to interfere with Olympic competitions.  Olympic officials 
have been forced to reschedule many outdoor events. 
 
 
 
¶13.  During a rainstorm on Cypress Mountain, American women's 
freestyle mogul skier Hannah Kearney upset Canadian gold medal 
 
hopeful Jenn Heil to unexpectedly take the first US gold medal of 
the Games.  Canadian efforts to win a gold medal on Canadian soil, 
a feat never achieved in the Winter Olympics, has been a constant 
feature of Canadian media coverage leading up to the 2010 Games.  A 
schedule and results of all competitions throughout the Games can 
be found at http://www.vancouver2010.com/olympic-schedule -results/.
