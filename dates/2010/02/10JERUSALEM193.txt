SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (02/02): President Abbas said he 
will respond to Special Envoy Mitchell's proposals on Thursday 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
-------------The three dailies lead with news on Palestinian 
Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas stating during a press 
conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin that the 
PA will respond Thursday to Special Envoy George Mitchell's 
proposals for resuming talks with Israel. Abbas reiterated that the 
PA will resume peace talks with Israel if the latter stops 
settlement activities for three months and accepts the 1967 borders 
as the borders of an independent Palestinian state. He emphasized 
that the cessation of all settlement activity is not a condition, 
but an obligation under the road map. 
 
In the weekly cabinet meeting yesterday, PA Prime Minister Salam 
Fayyad condemned the settlers' and soldiers' attacks against 
Palestinians in the northern West Bank last week. The cabinet called 
on the international community to exert pressure on Israel to end 
the crippling siege imposed on the Gaza Strip, enabling the PA to 
start reconstruction. 
The cabinet also allocated more than 1,000 dunums (1 million square 
meters) of land to build on an industrial zone in Jenin as part of 
the PA's efforts to strengthen the national economy. 
 
The dailies and Maan report that Israeli forces discovered two 
explosive devices on separate beaches in Ashkelon and Ashdod on 
Monday. Israel suspects that Hamas is behind this incident. 
 
Independent news agency Maan and Al-Quds report that Fatah Central 
Committee Member Nabil Sha'ath said on Monday he intends to visit 
the Gaza Strip without prior approval from Hamas. "My visit to Gaza 
comes upon a decision by the Fatah Revolutionary Council, and by 
President Abu Mazen. It is part of the Palestinian homeland, and I 
won't seek a visa or approval or special permission from anybody," 
he said.

BLOCK QUOTE: 
------------ 
Al-Quds runs an op-ed by Alex Fishman that originally appeared in 
Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth under the title "What To Do With 
Fayyad?" in which he opines that after Israel's initial treatment of 
Prime Minister Fayyad as their "Golden Boy," he has amassed more 
power than Israel ever thought he would. Fishman argues that Israel 
wanted Fayyad to enact political, economic, and security reforms, 
but to stop at that. Now Israel is afraid of Fayyad's power, 
especially in international organizations, and fears that he will 
convince the UN Security Council to adopt a resolution recognizing 
an independent Palestinian state on the 1967 borders with Jerusalem 
as its capital, without negotiations with Israel.
