EVACUATIONS/AMERICAN CITIZEN AND LE STAFF WHEREABOUTS 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
¶1.      (SBU)  The Children of the Promise charter flight 
scheduled to bring six orphans and two escorts to Miami did 
not depart Port-au-Prince February 21 as scheduled, due to 
airport security concerns regarding the group's departure 
paperwork.  The children and their American citizen escorts 
stayed overnight at a government day care center.  Embassy 
Port-au-Prince is working with the Haitian Office of Child 
Protective Services and the Prime Minister's office to assist 
in resolving outstanding paperwork issues.  The Office of 
Senator Klobuchar (D-MN) has expressed an interest in this 
case.  (TF1/OCS e-mail, Ops/Embassy Port-au-Prince e-mail) 
 
¶2.      (SBU)  Two aid workers injured in a February 19 bus 
accident scheduled to be medically evacuated to the USNS 
Comfort February 20 were sent instead to the University of 
Miami Medical Facility in Port-au-Prince because the Comfort's 
deck was unavailable and the USS Bataan did not have the 
capacity to treat head trauma.  (TF1/SOUTHCOM e-mail) 
 
 
¶3.      (U)  Media report there were no orphans among the 33 
children an American missionary group attempted to remove from 
Haiti.  Residents of Citron neighborhood, where 13 of the 
children lived, said each of the children was given away by a 
parent or close relative.  Parents in the mountain town of 
Callabas, outside Port-au-Prince, gave similar accounts.  (AP) 
 
 
HEALTH CONDITIONS 
----------------- 
 
¶4.      (SBU)  Waste accumulation is creating conditions for 
major disease outbreaks, including cholera.  Public health 
specialists worry diseases stemming from the buildup of human 
waste in the camps may be the most pressing health threat in 
the city.  (DHS NOC Update Report #78) 
 
 
HUMANITARIAN/SECURITY/INFRASTRUCTURE 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶5.      (SBU)  USAID inspected seven child-friendly spaces 
constructed by Save the Children in Jacmel, Haiti.  An 
additional 30 are planned for the town and surrounding area. 
Each space currently holds between 90 and 140 children. (DHS 
NOC Update Report #77) 
 
¶6.      (SBU)  A 74-foot schooner departed the Florida Keys 
loaded with 10 tons of donated food, water, medicine, tools, 
and other supplies from local residents and businesses.  It is 
expected to arrive in a remote Haitian region inaccessible to 
larger relief ships on/about February 27.  (DHS NOC Update 
Report #78)
