SUBJECT: Chile Response to Iran Human Rights Demarche 
 
REF: MULL/URBAN EMAIL 2/6/2010 
 
Per ref email, poloff delivered points regarding the human rights 
situation in Iran to Gerardo Ateaga, the deputy director of the 
MFA's Human Rights office, on February 8.  Ateaga said that Chile 
had no plans to issue a statement specifically about the possible 
February 11 protests.  However, Chile has prepared a substantive 
statement for Iran's Universal Periodic Review of human rights, 
which began today.  In their statement, Chile will call on Iran to 
curb the use of the death penalty, particularly for individuals 
under the age of 18.
