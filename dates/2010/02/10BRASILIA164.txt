¶1. (SBU) On January 27, Emboffs delivered the Department's demarche 
on Distracted Driving to representatives of the Ministry of 
Transportation and the Ministry of Health.  While Brazilian law 
does prohibit texting while driving, as of yet, neither Ministry 
has expressed an interest in committing the Government of Brazil to 
international efforts on this issue. 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Current Brazilian legislation includes prohibitions that 
would apply to texting while driving.  Specifically, Article 252, 
Subsection 5 of the Brazilian Transit Code (CONTRAN) prohibits 
driving with one hand on the steering wheel, which would by 
extension prohibit activities, such as texting, that require a 
driver to remove one hand from the steering wheel.  However, 
enforcement of this and other driving regulations by local and 
federal authorities is inconsistent. 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Additionally, the Brazilian legislature is considering a 
bill, PL 2,872/2008, which would amend Article 252 of CONTRAN; 
establishing a prohibition against "using a cellular telephone or 
mobile communications devices."  Using such a device would be 
considered a "grave infraction."  The bill is currently being 
considered in the relevant committees of the lower house.  If the 
lower house approves the bill, it will then move to the Senate for 
their approval.
