Press Release: (2010) 022 
 
NATO Secretary General condemns terrorist attack in Kabul 
 
I strongly condemn the terrorist attack which took place this 
morning in Kabul.  Once again, the enemies of Afghanistan 
have killed innocent civilians, Afghans and international 
workers alike.  I express my condolences to the families of 
those who have lost their lives, and a speedy recovery to the 
over 30 people who were injured.
