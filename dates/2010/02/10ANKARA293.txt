¶1. (SBU) On January 27, we delivered reftel A points to the MFA, 
which shared the information with the Ministry of Environment and 
Forestry (MEF) (reftel B).  Having sought and received comments from 
all relevant GOT agencies on the U.S. proposals for CITES COP15, MEF 
informed us on February 23 that Turkey will support listing of the 
family Coralliidae in Appendix II and removal of bobcat (Lynx rufus) 
from Appendix II.  Turkey will also support the U.S. proposals for 
listing of six shark species in Appendix II and for transferring the 
polar bear from Appendix II to Appendix I. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Although we did not request comments on bluefin tuna 
(Thunnus thynnus), MEF informed us Turkey believes it is too early 
to list the species in Appendix I.  They support allowing more time 
for recent International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic 
Tuna (ICCAT) initiatives to have an effect and improving ICCAT 
regulations in line with relevant scientific advice and transparent 
and fair implementation of management measures. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The GOT delegation to COP15 will include the following:
