SUBJECT: BERMUDA WATERS PART OF RESEARCH INTO PLASTIC POLLUTION 
 
¶1.      (U)  Local environmental group, Greenrock, hosted Global 
Pangaea Explorations, the owner of the research vessel "Sea 
Dragon," which is engaged in the first comprehensive study of 
plastic pollution in the world's oceans.  The "Sea Dragon" was 
in Bermuda as part of a research voyage across the Sargasso Sea 
in the North Atlantic Ocean, collecting samples to study plastic 
accumulation and studying fish for possible plastic ingestion 
and toxins in their tissues.  The voyage is part of a larger 
look at plastic pollution in the South Atlantic and North 
Pacific gyres. 
 
 
 
¶2.      (U) The American scientists were dismayed that every 
sample collected contained plastics.  The "Sea Dragon" crew 
participated in a cleanup of Bermuda beaches, during which they 
gathered a lot of trash, most of which originated from the U.S. 
The crew also gave presentations to school groups and liaised 
with the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences, a U.S. marine 
research and education nonprofit founded in Bermuda in 1903.

¶3.      (U)  The Consulate took advantage of the "Sea Dragon's" 
trip to bring together a group of environmental supporters and 
government representatives at an event on January 22.  CONGEN 
plans to partner with Greenrock to promote the World Wildlife 
Fund's (WWF) Earth Hour on March 27, during which Bermudians 
will be asked to turn off their lights for one hour.  The WWF 
recognized Bermuda as a flagship country for Earth Hour 2009.
