(SBU) Pol/Econ Counselor spoke with Ababew Feleke, chief of 
MFA's Directorate of International Organizations, on February 
26 regarding the Goldstone Report. Feleke said Ethiopia's 
position on the vote would be determined by its New York 
Mission to the United Nations.  Given that Ethiopia abstained 
on the last vote, Ababew's own view was that a further 
Ethiopian abstention was likely.
