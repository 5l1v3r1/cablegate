SUBJECT: Mexico Anticipates Difficult UPR Review for Iran 
 
REF: 10 STATE 1218 
 
¶1.    Poloff spoke with Mariana Salazar Albornoz, Director of 
International, Social, and Cultural Human Rights, February 5 to 
convey our concern about the human rights situation in Iran and our 
hope to address those concerns at the upcoming Universal Periodic 
Review session (UPR) on Iran, which will be held February 15 
(Reftel).  Poloff underscored that our delegation in Geneva would 
make an effort to provide meaningful suggestions to Iran, 
particularly related to the violent incidents that followed the 
June 12 elections, and that we looked for other states to actively 
engage in the discussion. 
 
 
 
¶2.    Salazar welcomed our comments.  She noted that Mexico had 
randomly drawn a slot on the examination troika for Iran, along 
with Pakistan and Senagal.  The Mexican Mission in Geneva has the 
lead on this issue, though the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has 
provided assistance with research.  Salazar said she would relay 
our concerns to the Mission's staff.  Salazar recalled that Mexico 
has previously voted in favor of UN resolutions condemning human 
rights violations by Iran.
