¶1.        SBU - Entire text. 
 
¶2.        SUMMARY:  Gulf Cartel DTO attacked two police stations in 
Nuevo Laredo evening of February 26.  Zetas DTO, apparently 
searching for the Gulf perpetrators, appeared armed outside a 
barbecue attended by post personnel.  Corroborated reports 
anticipate a Gulf versus Zetas clash afternoon/evening of February 
¶27.  On February 27, PO convened an Emergency Action Committee 
(EAC) meeting to review above developments.  EAC concurred that 
advice should be issued to post personnel via phone cascade, along 
with a Warden Message to local Amcits.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.       At approximately 2130 hours on February 26, Gulf DTO 
attacked two police stations in Nuevo Laredo.  Original reports 
were that grenades were used, and thumps were audible from at least 
two of our residences.  Authorities now say that satchel 
charge-type IEDs were employed, with no casualties.  The attack has 
made the Laredo media, and will likely be picked up by wire 
services in the U.S.  The likely motive is a "calling card" by Gulf 
DTO, sending message that they can strike in the Zetas' heartland. 
 
¶4.       At approximately 2230 hours, Zetas DTO personnel wearing 
balaclavas deployed in the street outside a barbecue attended by 
post personnel at a housing compound.  They displayed AK47s 
weapons, and ordered everyone away from the street and indoors. 
They clearly were looking for something on the street, and left 
quickly.  Post concludes that they were looking for the Gulf 
perpetrators of the bombing of the police stations, and wanted 
third parties out of their way.  RSO contacted local authorities, 
who immediately offered assistance.  Post personnel stayed at 
compound until it was judged safe to travel.  (COMMENT:  A GOM 
report that PO was present at the time and that gunmen entered the 
premises were a garble.  PO had left shortly before the incident, 
and the gunmen did not enter the property.  END COMMENT.) 
 
¶5.       Several reports indicate an impending gun battle between 
the two DTOs in Nuevo Laredo within 48 hours, likely the 
afternoon/evening of February 27.  EAC decided to initiate post's 
phone cascade system to advise post personnel to stay off the 
streets, and will also send warden message to same effect to 
Amcits. 
 
¶6.       EAC discussed advisability of continuing with a visa 
outreach event scheduled for afternoon of February 27 at a local 
university.  PO concluded that turnout would be light, and that the 
downside of being seen to cancel a public event for the first time 
during recent violence was outweighed by the downside risk to post 
personnel and attendees of being on the streets at that time.  We 
are stressing to the local media that we are not cancelling due to 
security situation, but rather rescheduling because we anticipated 
a light turnout resulting from that situation. 
 
¶7.       EAC reviewed tripwires and agreed to continue developing 
tripwires for intermediate actions short of authorized departure 
(see Reftel A). 
 
¶8.       PO will call post personnel who witnessed the Zetas 
outside the housing compound to discuss, and will follow up with a 
town hall meeting on March 1.
