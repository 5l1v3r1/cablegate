REF: A) BIS e-mail request dated January 22, 2010 (01210110) 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) conducted 
a post shipment verification (PSV) at Hwadar Scientific Technology 
Co (Hwadar). The item in question for this PSV is a Symmetricom 
Timeprovider high precision clock exported to Hwadar on or about 
February 26, 2009.  According to information provided by OEA, this 
system is likely classified under Export Control Classification 
Number 7A994 and controlled for anti-terrorism reasons, meaning that 
it can be shipped license free to virtually all destinations and 
end-users worldwide without a license.  Based on the 7A994 
classification, a license may be required to ship this item for 
military end use in mainland China.  The exporter was Symmetricom, 
Inc. of Puerto Rico. 
 
¶3.  According to the Hong Kong Inland Revenue Department Business 
Registration office, Hwadar has been in existence since 1998.  Li, 
Yiu Sun is listed as the proprietor of the company (it is a sole 
proprietorship). 
 
¶4.  According to the web site of Rock Electronic (www.rockelec.com), 
Hwadar is the Hong Kong affiliate of Rock Electronic which is 
located in Shenzhen.  Rock Electronics markets itself as a total 
solution provider for customers that need timing frequency products 
or technology.  According to its website, Rock Electronics is an 
authorized distributor for Symmetricom in China although the 
Symmetricom website does not list Rock Electronic as a distributor. 
Additional web research reveals an additional web site for Rock 
Electronic which lists a range of customers including the Xian 
Institute of Navigation Technology, the Shanghai Astronomical 
Observatory, China Shipbuilding 722, Chengdu 10 and Chengdu 29. 
 
¶5.  On February 8, 2010, ECO and FCS Commercial Assistant Carrie 
Chan visited the company at the address noted above and met with Yan 
Ming, General Manager of Rock Electronic and Zhang Jun, V.P. Sales 
Manager for Rock Electronic.  Mr. Yan Ming's business card also 
lists Rock Electronic (H.K.) Co., Ltd., and Hwadar Scientific 
Technology Co.  According to Mr. Yan Ming, Hwadar is a subsidiary of 
Rock Electronic and acts as its shipping and receiving affiliate in 
Hong Kong.  Rock Electronic is a trading company active in the area 
of timing related electronics.  The company's typical customers 
include the Chinese Academy of Science, ZTE and the Shanghai 
Astronomy Observatory.  Mr. Yan Ming mentioned, at this point, that 
a license to sell a cesium clock to the Shanghai Astronomy 
Observatory had been denied in 2009.  He inquired whether future 
applications would likewise be denied. 
 
¶6.  As to the specific shipment in question, Mr. Yan Ming stated 
that the item was destined for ZTE in Hong Kong.  According to Mr. 
Yan Ming, ZTE is a global telecom equipment and systems provider. 
In this case, the item is being combined with other ZTE items (that 
it cannot itself manufacture) for shipment to Ethiopia for use in a 
civil telecommunications project there.  Mr. Yan Ming provided 
documentation indicating that the item had been delivered to ZTE 
(H.K.) Limited. 
 
¶7.  Mr. Yan Ming was open and forthcoming during the interview.  He 
indicated that he was keen to keep the company's reputation clear so 
as to continue to be able to obtain U.S. origin technology. 
 
¶8.  Based on the information at hand, ECO finds Hwadar to be a 
suitable recipient of U.S. origin technology (as consolidator and 
freight forwarder for Rock Electronic and not necessarily as end 
user).  ECO recommends that BIS may wish to consider Rock 
Electronic's apparent customers in future licensing decisions.
