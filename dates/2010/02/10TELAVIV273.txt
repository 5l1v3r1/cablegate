REF: STATE 6703 
 
¶1. (U) Post delivered demarche on Distracted Driving (reftel) to GOI 
Ministry of Transportation and the National Road Safety Authority, 
as well as the Foreign Ministry.  Although an official response has 
yet to be received, unofficially we have received confirmation that 
Israel has in force laws and sanctions against cellphone use by 
drivers. 
 
¶2. (U) Use of a mobile telephone by a driver without a hands-free 
device is unlawful in Israel, and violation carries a fine of 1000 
shekels (about US$270).  Such use constituted 10.2 percent of all 
traffic violations in 2007, some 84,000 cases, and is expected to 
have grown since then.  Police and media report that the practice is 
widespread.  Post understands that, although text messaging is not 
mentioned specifically in the law, because it involves cellphone use 
in a "hands on" manner it would be covered by existing statute.  The 
Israeli Ministry of Transportation and Road Safety plans to place 
extra traffic police details around Israel with the goal of catching 
drivers who use their cellphones en route. 
 
¶3. (U) Full details of applicable Israeli laws will be conveyed with 
the official response when received.
