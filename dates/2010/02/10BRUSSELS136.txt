(U)  Poloff delivered reftel points to Veronique Joosten, 
Attach for International Organizations in the Human Rights 
Department at the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), 
on January 27.  Joosten said that Belgium supports the U.S. 
recommendations.  She said that she had been directed to 
prepare Universal Periodic Review questions for Belgium on 
Iran covering "everything" by her boss, Lieke Biesemans, the 
human rights deputy director at the MFA.  However, she said 
that the EU would soon be meeting to divide up the topic 
questions on Iran to reduce any overlap with other EU 
countries.  She said that Belgium has "no idea" how to best 
influence Iran to show greater respect for human rights.
