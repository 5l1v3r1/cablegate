¶1.  (U) Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for public Internet. 
 
¶2.  (U) This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 7. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) invited 
the Russian DCM and Political Officer to a meeting on February 9 to 
urge U.S. and Russia's support for Kazakhstan's proposal to host a 
Global Initiative to Counter Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT) conference in 
Astana.  MFA plans to host the conference of experts and 
policy-makers on or around April 7 so it could serve as a 
"springboard" for the April 12-13 Global Nuclear Security Summit 
(GNSS).  While the MFA is working on the agenda and specific topics, 
Sadykov underlined that U.S. and Russian support were necessary 
before substantive planning could begin.  Sadykov also sought U.S. 
and Russia's support for Kazakhstan's bid to join the Missile 
Technology Control Regime (MTCR).  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Director of the 
Multilateral Cooperation Department, Barlybay Sadykov, invited for a 
meeting the Russian DCM and Political officer to further discuss 
Kazakhstan's proposal to hold a Global Initiative to Counter Nuclear 
Terrorism (GICNT) conference in Astana (ref A).  During the February 
9 meeting, Sadykov urged the U.S. and Russia, as GICNT co-chairs, to 
support the conference in principle and to "do so expeditiously to 
assure appropriate participation and representation of member 
states."  The Russian DCM and Political Officer told Sadykov that 
Kazakhstan's proposal is under consideration in Moscow and 
Washington. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Sadykov said the Kazakhstanis intends to hold the 
conference before the Global Nuclear Security Summit (GNSS), "on or 
around April 7."  (NOTE: The MFA was initially flexible on the 
timing and amendable to holding the conference either before or 
after the GNSS (ref A).  END NOTE.)  He asserted that the conference 
could serve as "a springboard" for the GNSS.  While GNSS would 
address the issue of nuclear terrorism from the global perspective, 
he opined, the Astana conference could focus on regional 
cooperation.  Target participants would include "experts and 
political decision-makers" from agencies in capitals dealing with 
nuclear non-proliferation.  Sadykov said the agenda and specific 
topics should be ready within 10 days, but underlined that U.S. and 
Russian support were necessary before substantive planning could 
begin. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Sadykov used this opportunity to seek U.S. and Russia's 
support for Kazakhstan's bid to join the Missile Technology Control 
Regime (MTCR) (ref B).  He stressed that U.S. and Russia are 
"members of authority whose voices carry weight."  Sadykov allowed 
that the question of new members joining MTCR is "a nuanced, 
political question," but expressed hope that U.S. and Russia will 
support Kazakhstan "in the spirit of our strategic partnership." 
 
¶6.  (SBU) ACTION REQUEST: Post would appreciate the Department's 
expeditious response to Kazakhstan's proposal of hosting a GICNT 
conference in Astana on April 7.  We would also appreciate guidance 
on responding to Sadykov's request concerning the MTCR.
