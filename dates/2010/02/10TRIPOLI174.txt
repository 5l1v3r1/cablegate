SUBJECT: TRIPOLI - CERTIFICATION OF CONSULAR MANAGEMENT CONTROLS 
 
¶1.      Embassy Tripoli completed our certification of consular 
management controls on February 28, 2010. Yael Lempert, A/DCM 
and Consular Chief (FS-01) has certified the successful 
completion of this management review. 
 
¶2.      The results of the review follow: 
 
¶A.      Inventory Count and Reconciliation of Accountable Consular 
Items: The Consular Chief and RSO Robert Kimbrough conducted a 
comprehensive count of the inventory of accountable consular 
supplies on February 28, 2010. Post is using the AI module to 
maintain its inventory of accountable consular items, and the 
physical number of items on hand reconciles with inventory 
records. 
 
¶B.      Guidance: All consular officers are familiar with and have 
access to basic consular references and instructions. The 
consular chief checks classified e-mail daily, and all consular 
officers have access to classified e-mail. 
 
¶C.      CST Management: Post has reviewed its CST tables and is in 
full compliance. 
 
¶D.      Physical Access: Post is in compliance with all Physical 
Access requirements with the following exception: (#1) Post was 
allowing LES to arrive and enter the section in the morning 5-10 
minutes before any cleared Americans were present. Post has 
corrected this and now requires a cleared American to arrive 
first and open up each morning. 
 
¶E.      Access to Personally Identifiable Information: Post is in 
full compliance. 
 
¶F.      Control/Reconciliation/Destruction of Controlled Items: 
Post has reviewed procedures and is in full compliance. 
 
¶G.      Cash Accountability: Post has reviewed procedures and 
files, and is in full compliance. 
 
¶H.      Periodic Comparison of MRV Fees and NIV Applications: Post 
is in full compliance. 
 
¶I.      Referral System: Post has reviewed procedures and is in 
full compliance. 
 
¶J.      Training: Post is in full compliance, with the following 
exception: (#1) ACO has not yet taken PC-400 or PC-417. She will 
do so immediately. 
 
¶K.      Standards of Employee Conduct: Post has reviewed 
procedures, and is in full compliance, except for the following: 
(#1) While all Consular staff recuse themselves from any and all 
involvement with a case in which there may be a real or 
perceived conflict of interest, we did not have a written policy 
on this topic. Upon realizing we needed a written policy, we 
posted one in the section, and all Consular employees reviewed 
it. 
 
¶L.      Namecheck and Clearance Reviews: Post is in full 
compliance. 
 
¶M.      Visa Lookout Accountability: Post is in full compliance. 
 
¶N.      Intake, Review and Screening: Post has reviewed 
procedures, and is in full compliance. 
 
¶O.      Oversight of Processing: Post is in full compliance, with 
the following exceptions: (#1) Consular chief has no line of 
sight view of print stations, due to the physical layout of the 
section. However, vice-consul has direct line of sight view of 
the print stations, and (#2) Post has never conducted an 
unannounced visit to the office of our panel physician. We will 
do so in the coming months. 
 
¶P.      Biometric Collection: Post has reviewed procedures, and is 
in full compliance. 
 
¶Q.      Photo Standards: Post is in full compliance. 
 
¶R.      Visa Adjudication Oversight: Post has reviewed procedures, 
and is in full compliance. 
 
¶S.      Files: Since Post began NIV processing, we have been using 
the electronic DS-160 application. Thus, we have no NIV files. 
We do not process IV's. All of our ACS files are managed 
appropriately, in accordance with regulations. 
 
¶T.      Passports and CRBA's: Post has reviewed procedures, and is 
in full compliance. 
 
¶U.      Fraud Prevention Programs: Post has a designated Fraud 
 
TRIPOLI 00000174  002 OF 002 
 
 
Prevention Manager. However, as a relatively new section, which 
only started full NIV issuance in April 2009, we are still 
developing our anti-fraud procedures and FPU. We currently 
operate on an ad hoc basis vis-`-vis fraud, dealing with fraud 
cases as each arises. Our FPM is currently working on developing 
written criteria for referring cases for investigations and 
creating a more fulsome FPU. 
 
¶V.      Wilberforce Act: Post is in full compliance. 
 
¶W.      Oversight of Applicant Service Centers: Not applicable, as 
Tripoli has no ASC's. 
 
¶X.      Consular Agents: Not applicable, as Tripoli has no 
Consular Agents.
