¶1. (SBU) A senior Ontario official told Post on January 29 that the 
Province's trade and cooperation agreement with Quebec, signed in 
September 2009, falls short of granting Quebec domestic status in 
Ontario.  Contrary to speculation, Quebec-based companies applying 
for Ontario's FIT program are required to meet the same Ontario 
domestic content requirements as foreign companies. 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Ontario Power Authority (OPA), responsible for 
procuring new electricity generation in the Province, received 
roughly 1,000 applications for projects over 10 kilowatts (kW) and 
nearly 1,200 microFIT applications (mostly for residential roof-top 
solar power systems) during the first round of the FIT program in 
October and November 2009.  The larger scale FIT applications are 
still being assessed; the OPA will release their decisions in March 
¶2010.
