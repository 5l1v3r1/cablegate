SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (02/26): Palestinian press report 
on the State Department reaction to Israel designating two holy 
sites in the West Bank as Israeli heritage sites 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida leads with a headline stating that the State 
Department criticized the Israeli decision to add two holy sites in 
the West Bank to the list of Israeli heritage sites, calling it 
"provocative." The dailies report on State Department Spokesman 
Phillip Crowley noting that the US asked both the Israelis and the 
Palestinians not to take unilateral actions that would harm the 
chances for resuming peace negotiations. 
 
In related news, the dailies report that for the fourth consecutive 
day, protests in Hebron and confrontations between Palestinians and 
peace activists and Israeli soldiers continued. Al-Quds reports that 
Palestinian Authority (PA) Minister of Religious Affairs Al-Habbash 
met with Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa in Cairo yesterday 
and called for an urgent meeting of the Arab Ministers of Religious 
Affairs to discuss the implications of the "Israeli violations." 
Reports also note that Prime Minister Fayyad is expected to perform 
the Friday Prayers today at the Al-Ibrahimi mosque in Hebron. 
 
Al-Quds front pages news that hundreds of settlers entered Joseph's 
Tomb in Nablus last night under full protection from the IDF and 
Israeli police. The settlers destroyed a school and wrote 
anti-Palestinian statements on the walls. 
Al-Ayyam continues to report that indirect negotiations between the 
Palestinians and Israeli are expected to resume by mid-March. The 
report notes that despite the "unclear" responses the US submitted 
to PA President Mahmoud Abbas regarding the formula for 
negotiations, Arab states seem willing to accept this initiative. 
The report also notes that the Road Map, Resolutions 242 and 338, 
and the Arab peace initiative will be the terms of reference for the 
negotiations, according to the US responses. 
 
The dailies report on President Abbas' meeting with the Greek 
President and Prime Minister in Greece yesterday. 
Abbas will participate in the Arab Follow-Up Committee meeting next 
Tuesday. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida reports that the UN General Assembly will discuss 
the implementation of the Goldstone report's recommendations today. 
The EU parliament calls for implementing the reports' 
recommendations, according to reports.

BLOCK QUOTE: 
------------ 
Al-Quds runs an editorial under the title "The World Must Provide 
Solutions to the Current Situation" which criticizes Israel for its 
continued provocative measures in the Palestinian Territories and 
accuses the Israeli government of distracting the world from 
focusing on the real conflict and finding a solution to it. The 
author believes that the peace process is indeed dead because if it 
were still alive, he argued, Israel wouldn't have had the courage to 
do what it is doing now.

Palestinian Cyberspace: 
----------------------- 
Daoud Kuttab, a prominent Palestinian blogger, blogged under the 
title, "Are Serious Mideast Negotiations Around the Corner?" saying, 
"The state [Israel] is ruled by right-wing hardliners that are not 
likely to make the kind of difficult decisions needed to usher in a 
 
JERUSALEM 00000351  002 OF 002 
 
 
viable independent state of Palestine with contiguous borders, or a 
solution to the issues of Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees ... The 
next few months will reveal whether we are seeing a major 
breakthrough or just another mirage." 
Palestinian cyberspace widely circulated remarks made by Harvard 
professor Martin Kramer at the Herzliya conference under the title 
"Harvard Prof Advocates Palestinian Population Control", saying "The 
treatment of Palestinians has long been described as sub-human, and 
now one Harvard professor treats Israel's refugee program like a 
rodent infestation. Harvard University's Dr. Martin Kramer delivered 
a speech in Israel recently, describing his answer to the 
Palestinian refugee problem: population control. More specifically, 
he suggests the international community to this by "stopping 
pro-natal subsidies to Palestinians with refugee status."
