REF: MADRID 68 
 
¶1. On February 22 Ambassador Solomont received a letter from 
Spanish Secretary of State (vice minister) for Climate Change 
Teresa Ribera requesting, on behalf of the EU, consultations 
with the USG on climate change at the ministerial level.  The 
text of the letter is as follows: 
 
(begin text) 
Dear Ambassador, 
 
The current Spanish Presidency of the Council of the European 
Union is persuaded of the need to continue the international 
dialogue on climate change, after the Copenhaguen Accord. 
 
Therefore, I will invite the European Commission and Belgium, 
as troika of the EU, to come with us to undertake 
consultations with your country at Ministerial level. 
 
I would be grateful if you can relay this proposal to Mr. 
Todd Stern, Especial (sic) Envoy as well as Mr. Michael 
Froman, from the Executive Office in order to fix a 
convenient date in the next weeks.  With pleasure we are 
flexible to meet on the occasion of any international event 
or to visit your country 
 
Look forward to your answer 
 
Yours sincerely, 
 
Teresa Ribera Rodriguez 
Secretary of State for Climate change.

Secretary Ribera and, if so, what the response should be.
