Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (C) During an 80-minute meeting with EAP A/S Campbell 
February 2 on regional and bilateral issues, Vice Foreign 
Minister Yabunaka agreed on the need for a continued focus on 
DPRK denuclearization and cautioned against being distracted 
by DPRK calls for peace regime discussions; called on the 
United States and Japan to leverage their alliance to shape 
China's choices; and welcomed greater U.S. involvement in 
regional organizations, including the EAS.  Yabunaka also 
agreed with A/S Campbell on the utility of Japan proposing a 
vice minister-level U.S.-Japan-China trilat, and said that FM 
Okada had been invited to travel to Burma in May.  VFM 
Yabunaka said he would try to address budget and timing 
issues involving former American WWII POWs' travel to Japan. 
He also pledged to look into ways to facilitate contact 
between left behind parents and their children, in addition 
to efforts to promote Japan's Hague Convention accession. 
End Summary. 
 
DPRK 
---- 
 
¶2. (C) EAP A/S Kurt Campbell opened his February 2 meeting 
with Vice Foreign Minister Mitoji Yabunaka by describing the 
current state of play with the DPRK, including ongoing U.S. 
efforts to bring North Korea back to the Six Party Talks and 
the apparent economic impact of UNSCR 1874 implementation. 
The Assistant Secretary stressed that the United States 
remained focused on using U.S.-DPRK contacts within Six Party 
framework to make progress on denuclearization, and that we 
would not allow the North Koreans to change the focus of 
discussions from denuclearization to creation of a peace 
regime.  In light of the DPRK's poor harvest last year and 
economic distortions caused by the North Korean won's 
revaluation, Pyongyang may need external assistance soon. 
That said, there are no signs -- including in North-South 
contacts -- that the North will return to the Six Party Talks 
anytime soon, A/S Campbell said.  Succession issues also 
remained unclear, he added. 
 
¶3. (C) VFM Yabunaka welcomed continued U.S. adherence to a 
policy of strategic patience with the DPRK, and said that any 
calls for peace regime discussions were a ""trap.""  Before any 
discussions about peace arrangements, the Six Parties needed 
to fully agree on denuclearization.  VFM Yabunaka noted that, 
in his January 27 meeting with Russian First Deputy Foreign 
Minister Denisov, his Russian counterpart offered the view 
that 1874 implementation was hurting the DPRK, and that the 
resultant lack of certain goods in Pyongyang was even having 
a negative impact on the Russian Embassy's operations there, 
""including the embassy's in-house dental clinic.""  ""Things in 
North Korea seemed to be very chaotic,"" Yabunaka said. 
 
¶4. (C) In response to A/S Campbell's question about reported 
DPJ contacts with the North, Yabunaka acknowledged that there 
had been some speculative reports, and that any feelers were 
likely through the Chosen Soren (Association of North Korean 
Residents in Japan).  Responding to Asia DG Akitaka Saiki's 
query about recent reports of two detained American citizens 
in North Korea, A/S Campbell provided an update on U.S. 
actions, including efforts to secure consular access through 
the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang.  Also in response to DG 
Saiki's question, ASD Gregson said that future efforts in the 
area of Fullest Possible Accounting of U.S. servicemen lost 
during the Korean War would have to take place within the 
context of overall U.S.-DPRK relations to prevent the North 
from using this humanitarian effort for other goals. 
 
China 
----- 
 
¶5. (C) On U.S.-PRC relations, A/S Campbell noted that Chinese 
domestic political imperatives not to appear weak in dealing 
with the United States will likely lead to continued ups and 
downs in the bilateral relationship.  The Chinese reaction to 
the Taiwan arms package was one manifestation of this, and 
there will likely another negative reaction to the Dalai 
Lama's upcoming visit to Washington and senior-level meetings 
in his capacity as a spiritual leader.  Compounding our 
 
TOKYO 00000214  002.2 OF 003 
 
 
challenges in the months ahead were personnel changes among 
those handling the bilateral relationship, including Vice 
Minister He Yafei's transfer to Geneva.  In spite of possible 
difficulties ahead, the United States would seek to work 
closely with China on climate change, cyber-related matters 
and Iran, among other issues, A/S Campbell said. 
 
¶6. (C) VFM Yabunaka noted that the U.S.-Japan relationship is 
key in helping to shape China's choices, and that the United 
States and Japan must work closely together to encourage 
China to pursue ""more responsible interactions with the rest 
of the world.""  On Iran, Yabunaka recalled again his 
conversation with Russian First DFM Denisov, who had said 
that China would likely approve tougher action through a 
UNSCR, would insist on IAEA involvement, and would prefer 
diplomatic over military action. 
 
¶7. (C) The United States did not see Japan's relations with 
the United States and China as zero sum, A/S Campbell said. 
In fact, Japan's recently improved relationship with the PRC 
was positive, and put Japan in a good position to press for a 
U.S.-Japan-China trilateral meeting.  VFM Yabunaka noted that 
he had discussed this matter with outgoing Chinese Ambassador 
Cui Tiankai, and Yabunaka agreed with A/S Campbell that it 
made sense for Japan to press for a vice minister-level 
trilateral in the summer. 
 
Regional Architecture 
--------------------- 
 
¶8. (C) The United States recognizes that it needs to play a 
greater role in regional organizations, and to that end will 
soon begin a dialogue with Southeast Asian partners on 
possible participation in the East Asian Summit, A/S Campbell 
continued.  For the EAS to be effective, however, it needed 
to be better choreographed with APEC, and this process will 
take time, A/S Campbell said.  A/S Campbell urged Japan, in 
discussing regional architecture, to continue to avoid ""Asia 
for the Asians"" formulations.  VFM Yabunaka welcomed possible 
U.S. participation in the EAS and noted that recent GOJ 
statements on regional architecture have included a strong 
call for U.S. involvement. 
 
Burma 
----- 
 
¶9. (C) A/S Campbell noted that discussions with Burma's 
senior leadership will not be an easy process, but the United 
States will continue to press for progress in democratization 
and human rights, and we are grateful for Japan's support in 
this area.  It remains unclear whether the elections there 
will be held in the March/April timeframe, or in October. 
VFM Yabunaka said that FM Okada was invited to visit in May, 
speculating that the reason for this timing was that the 
Burmese might be ready to discuss election preparation 
details. 
 
POWs and International Parent Child Abduction 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶10. (C) A/S Campbell expressed gratitude for Japanese 
Ambassador Fujisaki's efforts to promote reconciliation 
between Japan and the some 200 American POWs from the 
Defenders of Bataan and Corregidor.  Significantly, the 
Japanese Government had agreed as a gesture of reconciliation 
to bring a number of these veterans to Japan.  Unfortunately, 
timing and budget issues threatened to undermine what could 
be a great event that would send a positive message about 
U.S.-Japan relations, A/S Campbell said.  He urged the GOJ to 
seek ways in which to speed up and expand the program to 
fully leverage its potential.  VFM Yabunaka pledged to look 
into it. 
 
¶11. (C) On the subject of International Parent Child 
Abductions, A/S Campbell stressed that Congressional, USG and 
public interest in this issue is very high, and that a 
continued lack of progress in at least facilitating contact 
between left behind parents and their children will further 
worsen perceptions of Japan's willingness to address this 
urgent humanitarian matter.  Ambassador Roos and A/S Campbell 
urged the GOJ to take steps to meet the needs of left behind 
parents while working towards acceding to the Hague 
Convention.  Yabunaka promised to seriously examine what 
 
TOKYO 00000214  003.2 OF 003 
 
 
steps could be taken to actively and publicly deal with the 
existing cases and the hopes of left behind parents to meet 
with their children.
