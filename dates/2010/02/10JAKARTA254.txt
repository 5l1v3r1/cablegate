SUBJECT: ACEH POLICE ACTION NETS FOUR MILITANTS, ESTIMATED 50 AT 
LARGE IN JUNGLE 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  On February 22, Aceh police carried out an 
operation to break up a suspected Islamic militant training camp in 
the remote jungles of Aceh Besar District, arresting four militants 
and seizing guns and jihadi books and videos.  Police continue to 
search for an estimated 50 militants still at large, reportedly 
including one Afghan national.  Police believe the militants were 
training combatants to fight in Palestine.  It appears that although 
some of the militants are from Banda Aceh, most come from Java. 
According to police, former Aceh Freedom Movement (GAM) members do 
not appear to be involved.   END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Police intelligence in Aceh began investigating rumors 
about radical jihadist activity in Aceh in September 2009, but had 
difficulty locating the militants as they were continuously on the 
move, according to a senior police official in Banda Aceh. The 
police began their raid on the camp at 9 p.m. on February 22 and the 
operation continues.  Over 150 police, mostly Special Operations 
(Brimob), were involved in the police action.  The camp is located 
deep in the jungles near Jontho city in Aceh Besar District, in the 
Jalin Mountain area. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Police arrested four militants:  Ismed Hakiki, 40; Zakky 
Rahmatullah 27, from Pandeglang, Banten Province in West Java; Yudi 
Zulfahri, 27, from Darul Imarah Subdistrict near Banda Aceh and 
Masykur Rahmat, 21, from Krueng Barona Jaya Subdistrict in Banda 
Aceh.  Most of the militants are from Java, although some were 
recruited from Banda Aceh, police said. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Police reportedly confiscated rifles, commando knives, DVDs 
about the Bali bombings, books about jihad, military uniforms, and 
cash.  Police told us that they are not sure where the militants got 
this material or the background of the militants, although they 
suspect there may be Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) links.   Police do not 
know if this group is connected with the incidents of violence 
against westerners in Banda Aceh in late 2009 but are investigating 
this possibility.  While the investigation is ongoing, local police 
speculated that the militants were preparing to fight in Palestine 
and did not have a domestic Indonesian agenda.
