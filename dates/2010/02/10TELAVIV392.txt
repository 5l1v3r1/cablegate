¶1. (U) In follow-up on the Distracted Drivers demarche (ref A), Post 
has received from the Israel National Road Safety Authority (INRSA) 
the text of the applicable part of Israeli law.  The head of the 
INRSA offered the text in para 2 in informal translation from Hebrew 
(note: there is no official translation of Israeli law available). 
The first paragraph translates the applicable law, the second part 
provides definitions of "hands-free device" and "telephone" 
respectively. 
 
 
¶2. (U)   Begin Text: 
 
¶1.  When the car is moving 
(a) holding or using any telephone is prohibited.  Instead, use of a 
hands-free device is allowed. 
(b) sending or reading text messages (SMS) is prohibited. 
 
¶2.  A hands-free device is a device that is used as a phone that 
does not need to be held, and only if it is placed in a stable 
position that prevents it from falling.  A telephone could be any 
device intended for communication which has buttons that are pressed 
to dial.

¶3. (U) Although the Embassy has received no formal response to the 
demarche yet from the MFA, post believes the GOI can be considered 
as committed to road safety, and a potential contributor to the 
March UNRSC discussion on the topic.    Official response from the 
GOI will be conveyed when received.
