SUBJECT: SOUTH AFRICA'S RESPONSE TO U.S. CITES PROPOSALS 
 
REF: STATE 06668 
 
 ¶1. (U)  Environment, Science and Technology Officer 
delivered reftel points on U.S. CITES proposals to Elise 
Haber, Deputy Director for Conservation in the Department of 
International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO) and Sonja 
Meintjes, Deputy Director for Biodiversity Compliance in the 
Department of Water and Environmental Affairs (DWEA) on 
February 3.  EST Officer and SAG officials discussed each of 
the U.S. proposals and the SAG followed up with written 
responses to U.S. questions, summarized below.  Please note 
that the South African responses are not final official 
positions; they are preliminary views on the U.S. proposals. 
 
¶2. (U) TEXT OF SOUTH AFRICAN RESPONSE 
 
-- Sharks.  South Africa recognizes that the over 
exploitation of some marine species for commercial fisheries 
is becoming a serious problem; however sharks are protected 
in South African waters under the Marine Living Resources Act 
which prohibits the commercial fishing of sharks.  South 
Africa is sympathetic to the U.S. proposals, however we are 
concerned that the proposal as it stands contains elements 
that should be dealt with by the various fisheries bodies of 
the FAO and that U.S. concerns are not necessarily trade 
issues that would fall under CITES. 
 
-- Corals.  South Africa acknowledges that international 
trade in pink and red corals could eventually have a negative 
impact on the survival of the species in the wild if the 
trade is not properly monitored.  South Africa is sympathetic 
toward this proposal and will base its decision on the 
information supplied in the proposal. 
 
-- Transfer of Polar Bear from CITES Appendix II to Appendix 
¶I.  South Africa believes that the polar bear does not meet 
the biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I.  South 
Africa supports the principle of sustainable use of natural 
resources as is practiced in Canada where aboriginal people 
are allowed to benefit from the sustainable trade in polar 
bears.  An Appendix I listing might affect this sustainable 
trade negatively, and this will have a negative impact on the 
livelihoods of the aboriginal people.  South Africa shares 
the concerns of the U.S. regarding the shrinkage of polar 
bear habitat, but we are not convinced that this contributes 
to an increase in international trade in polar bear products. 
 
-- Deletion of Bobcat from Appendix II.  South Africa has 
previously supported the U.S. proposal on the bobcat (at 
COP-14), but the proposal was not accepted by the Parties due 
to the identification and look-alike problem of skins in 
trade.  South Africa notes that the U.S. has worked on the 
identification issue and will most likely support the 
proposal to delete the bobcat from CITES Appendix II. 
 
-- Snake Trade and Conservation Management. South Africa will 
support the U.S. proposal for a snake trade workshop 
especially since the workshop will be sponsored by the U.S. 
and will thus not have financial implications for the 
Secretariat. 
 
END TEXT OF SOUTH AFRICAN RESPONSE.
