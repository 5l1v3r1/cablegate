SUBJECT: Ecuadoran President Correa's Comments on Honduras and Haiti 
Following Meeting with Fernandez 
 
REF: SANTO DOMINGO 35 
 
¶1.  Ecuadoran President Rafael Correa, in a press conference 
following a 1/30/10 meeting with President Leonel Fernandez, 
declared that Ecuador would not recognize the  Porfirio Lobo 
government in Honduras, agreed with his Dominican counterpart that 
the Inter-American Democractic Charter should be strengthened to 
prevent future coups (Reftel), and called for the creation of an 
organization of Latin American states  to forestall such 
interruptions of constitutional order. 
 
 
 
¶2.  Correa, who had visited Haiti the day before, remarked that he 
was struck by the damage he had seen and rejected criticism of the 
U.S. military's role in providing assistance to Haiti, remarking 
that it doesn't matter where aid is coming from so long as it 
reaches those in need.  He added that his main purpose in coming to 
the Dominican Republic was to coordinate assistance to Haiti with 
Fernandez and  pledged to attend the 4/14/10 international 
conference on Haiti announced by the Dominican President.
