SUBJECT: NASA ADVANCES SCIENCE ENGAGEMENT IN INDONESIA 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: NASA Assistant Administrator Michael O'Brien 
advanced President Obama's science engagement efforts in Indonesia 
February 2-3.  He discussed cooperative partnership opportunities on 
space and Earth science and education with representatives from the 
Ministry of Research and Technology (MRT), National Institute of 
Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN), the Habibie Center, the Indonesian 
Academy of Sciences, relevant research agencies, and university 
representatives.  MRT identified a POC for future cooperation with 
NASA and provided guidance that discussions on potential projects 
need not wait until the Science and Technology Agreement currently 
being negotiated is signed.  LAPAN noted that it would prioritize 
cooperation with NASA in the area of space science application such 
as remote sensing on carbon emissions.  End Summary. 
 
NASA Outreach Advances Obama's Cairo Vision 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) O'Brien explained to all Indonesian counterparts NASA's 
current outreach effort is part of President Obama's science 
engagement through the Cairo Vision.  He outlined NASA's specific 
vision of cooperation with new potential partners such as Indonesia. 
 NASA aims to increase cooperation with Indonesia through 
joint-efforts in its science mission directorate and invites 
Indonesia to initiate ideas.  O'Brien provided several examples of 
current NASA cooperative programs: participation in the research of 
the International Space Station, GLOBE education program, AERONET, 
SERVIR, and other earth science applications, noting that any 
specific cooperative programs are subject to international 
agreements coordinated through the inter-agency process.  (Note: 
Currently, NASA has one formal agreement in place with Indonesia's 
Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) for 
cooperation in the AERONET program.  Program activities had lapsed, 
and O'Brien discussed separately with the Deputy Chairman of BPPT 
how to revive the activity.)  He explained that NASA focuses on 
government-to-government partnerships, with no exchange of funds 
that operate under a binding agreement.  Further, Mr. O'Brien 
explained that cooperation must be mutually beneficial to both the 
U.S. government and the government of Indonesia. 
 
MRT Appoints POC for Future Cooperation 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Ministry of Research and Technology (MRT), Indonesia's 
science coordinator, organized a meeting with a broad set of 
research agencies related to space science.  Agencies represented 
included: National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN), 
Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT), the 
Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG), Survey and 
Mapping Agency (BAKOSURTANAL), Ministry of Forestry, Ministry of 
Environment, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (KEMLU), Bandung Institute 
of Technology , and Gadjah Mada University.  All institutions 
welcomed cooperation with NASA, specifically the use of NASA Earth 
science and observation technology, to augment monitoring 
capabilities in the areas of climate change, food security, 
environmental enforcement, disasters and weather monitoring 
capability.  For the next steps, MRT Deputy Minister Teguh Rahardjo 
appointed Director for International Cooperation Nada Marsudi as the 
central point of contact for relevant agencies to put forth ideas 
for cooperation with NASA that were tangible and realistic for both 
parties.  He also noted that discussions and preparation for 
cooperative activities need not wait for what he expected would be a 
signing of the U.S.-Indonesia Science and Technology Agreement in 
March. 
 
LAPAN Prioritizes Space Science Application 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) LAPAN Chairman Dr. Adi Sadewo Salatun hosted a lunch and 
discussion meeting for the NASA delegation, including visual 
presentations of imagery taken by Indonesia's current satellites. 
LAPAN reports directly to the president and its mission is to 
enhance Indonesia's capabilities in the areas of space technology, 
space science, and remote sensing in facilities across the 
archipelago.  LAPAN emphasized it has limited capability because of 
a relatively small operational budget of $20 million.  LAPAN was 
enthusiastic but realistic about cooperation with NASA, emphasizing 
that cooperation in remote sensing data would likely offer the 
greatest benefit to both the US and Indonesia.  Salatun was 
articulate on the need for Indonesia to establish the ability to 
provide Measurable, Verifiable, and Reportable (MRV) emissions 
reductions for future carbon market and compensation schemes under 
climate mitigation.  Overall the meeting was productive for both 
NASA and LAPAN and provided a framework for initiating tangible 
cooperation in the near-term through LAPAN-generated ideas on 
specific areas of cooperation.  Other participants from LAPAN 
included Primary Secretary Dr. Bambang Kusumanto, Deputy Chairman 
for Space Technology, Dr. Soewarto Hardhienata, Deputy Chairman for 
Space and Science Assessment and Information, Mr. Bambang Setiawan 
Tedjasukmana, and Deputy Chairman for Remote Sensing, Mr. 
Nurhidayat. 
 
¶5. (SBU) O'Brien also met with a small group of scientists to talk 
broadly about Indonesia's scientific development history.  Those in 
attendance included Secretary General of the Indonesian Academy of 
Sciences, Dr. Budhi M. Suyitno, Deputy Chairman of the Habibie 
Center's science wing Mr. Agung Nugroho, and Indonesian Astronaut 
Dr. Pratiwi Sudarmono. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Assistant Administrator O'Brien's delegation cleared this 
message.
