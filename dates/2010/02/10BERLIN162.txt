Sharks: Germany Proposes Mutual Support 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (U) Germany is considering the U.S. shark proposal, but 
requests U.S. support for the EU shark proposal.  The EU shark 
proposal, which Germany initiated, proposes listing the 
porbeagle (lamna nasus) and spiny dogfish (squalus 
acanthias)in CITES Appendix II.  The German government 
believes that the U.S. will support the porbeagle proposal, 
but has no clear information on the U.S. position on the spiny 
dogfish proposal.  In addition, Germany has proposed a joint 
EU/U.S. side event on shark proposals during the COP15. They 
have not yet received an answer from the U.S. 
 
Corals 
------ 
 
¶5.  (U) Germany supports the U.S. coral proposal, as the EU is 
a co-sponsor.  Germany has doubts as to whether there is 
sufficient scientific information to support the coral 
proposal, but supports listing corals in Appendix II as a 
precaution. 
 
Polar Bears 
---------- 
 
¶6.  (U) Germany supports the U.S. polar bear proposal, but 
requests additional information to defend the proposal within 
the EU.  Germany questions if the trade in polar bear products 
and the threats to polar bear habitats truly fulfill the 
criteria to list polar bears in Appendix I. 
 
Bobcats 
------- 
 
¶7.  (U) Germany does not support the U.S. proposal. Experts 
from the German Environment Ministry and German Customs Agency 
do not believe that they have adequate guidelines to 
distinguish lynx furs from bobcat furs.  They have reviewed 
the proposed U.S. guidelines, but do not think they are 
sufficient, especially for furs without tails or ears.  They 
suggested that other European countries agree with this 
assessment. 
 
Snakes 
------ 
 
¶8.  (U) Germany supports the joint U.S./China proposal. 
 
German Requests 
-------------- 
 
¶9.  (U) Germany requested U.S. assistance to reach agreement 
on document 27, "Introduction from the Sea" and document 63, 
"Criteria to Include Species in Appendices I and II."  Germany 
supports the CITES secretariat's position on introduction from 
the sea and hopes to develop common procedures to handle 
marine species harvested in international waters.  Germany 
believes that strengthening the criteria for including marine 
species in the CITES appendices to match those for including 
land species will prevent overexploitation of marine species. 
 
Action Request 
------------- 
 
¶10.  (U) Action Request.  Post requests guidance on the U.S. 
position on the EU shark proposal, CITES document 27 and 
document 63.  In addition, Post requests guidance on the 
German proposal for joint EU/U.S. shark event at the COP15.
