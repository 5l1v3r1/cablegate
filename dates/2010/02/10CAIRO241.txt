¶1.  (SBU) Key Points 
 
 
 
--The GOE has introduced new financial regulations that allow 
state-owned enterprises to issue bonds and private companies to 
more easily issue corporate bonds. 
 
 
 
--For the first time, the GOE fixed a schedule for releasing 
treasury bonds. 
 
 
 
--These regulation changes are aimed at increasing access to 
finance for the GOE, state-owned enterprises, and the private 
sector.

Simplified Regulations for Issuing Corporate Bonds 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Minister of Investment Mahmoud Mohieldin announced in 
early January that he had amended regulations covering corporate 
bond issuances. Private businesses no longer need to submit a 
forecast for the company's financial statements for the period of 
the bond's maturity. We met with Mohamed Saleh, head of the Capital 
Markets Unit at the Ministry of Investment on January 13th to 
discuss changes in financial regulations. He told us that no 
accountant would certify forecasts of a company's financial 
statements for future years, which was required under the old 
regulations. He pointed out that it is unrealistic to make medium 
and long-term assessments of any company's financials and said that 
these regulations probably kept many companies from issuing bonds. 
These changes will make it much easier for private corporations to 
issue bonds. Under the new regulations, companies need to have a 
credit rating from a reputable credit rating agency.

State-Owned Enterprises Allowed to Issue Bonds 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) In January, the GOE changed its laws to allow state-owned 
enterprises (SOEs) to issue their own bonds to raise money. This 
will allow SOEs to raise money to fund large-scale infrastructure 
projects like sewage plants, roads, and housing developments, 
according to Saleh. The Ministry of Investment oversees most 
state-owned enterprises.

Fixed Schedule for Treasury Bond Release 
 
---------------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) At the beginning of January, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) 
set and publicly released a fixed schedule for the issuance of 
treasury bonds to make them predictable, increase their liquidity, 
and create more demand for them, according to Mohamed Assaad, 
Director of Debt Management at the MOF. Assaad told us that he 
thinks this will allow banks and other investors to factor 
government bonds into their investment plans for the year, creating 
a more stable and developed bond market. Assaad joked with us that 
before the MOF fixed its bond schedule, he would just decide what 
bonds to issue on a whim. According to the schedule, the MOF will 
issue 3-year bonds in January, April, July, and October, 5-year 
bonds in March and September, 7-year bonds in February, and 10-year 
bonds in August. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Assaad told us that he expects more stability in the bond 
market to allow the GOE to pay lower rates on treasury bonds it 
issues to fund the rising GOE deficit. Assaad told us that the GOE 
is increasingly raising money through bonds because they have a 
longer maturity than other financing options. Assaad said that the 
GOE expects to raise LE 15 billion ($2.77 billion) through the end 
of March, up from $10 billion during the same period last year.

Comment 
 
------- 
 
 
 
¶6. (SBU) The GOE is looking to the domestic bond market to offer 
long-term funding for the rising public deficit and the large 
infrastructure projects that Mohieldin has been talking about 
publicly. By issuing more bonds to increase the average maturity of 
Egypt's total debt, the GOE will be able to spread out its debt 
repayment. The GOE is probably trying to make it easier for 
companies to raise funds by issuing bonds to make up for the 
decline in bank lending to the private sector.
