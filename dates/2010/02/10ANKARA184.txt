¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  The looming February 4 nationwide "work 
stoppage" by six major labor confederations is garnering extensive 
media coverage but few reliable predictions on the extent of 
participation.  Turk-Is President Kumlu has carefully emphasized 
that what they will launch should not be termed a "general strike," 
because that would be illegal.  Turk-Is said most of its workers 
will "consider themselves on leave" February 4.  The main opposition 
Republican People's Party (CHP) has indicated that its employees 
will also not work February 4 to show its support for the protesting 
TEKEL workers.  The government so far has refrained from issuing any 
warnings or threats to the unions.  However, Turkish Airlines has 
stated that the employment contracts of those workers who 
participate in the strike may be cancelled.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The actual extent of the one-day general strike February 4 
called by the Turk-Is Labor Confederation (REFTEL) remains 
impossible to predict.  But the inclusion of five other labor union 
confederations of public and private workers -- DISK, Hak-Is, 
Memur-Sen, Kamu-Sen and KESK - suggests the impact may be 
significant.  All have announced they will participate between 8 
a.m. and 5 p.m.  Turk-Is President Mustafa Kumlu has carefully 
emphasized that what they will launch should not be termed a 
"general strike" (as it is illegal) but instead a "one day work 
stoppage."  Another confederation, the Independent Public Employees 
Unions Confederation (BASK), has announced that it will provide 
outside support to the six confederations and will also participate 
in the work stoppage.  Meanwhile, the main opposition Republican 
People's Party (CHP) has indicated that its party employees will 
also not work February 4 to show its support to the TEKEL workers. 
 
¶3. (U) Mustafa Turkel, President of the Food Workers Union 
(Tek-GidaIs) with whom the TEKEL workers are affiliated, insisted 
that the work stoppage would take place "with zero failure" in all 
establishments where the union is organized.  He estimated that one 
million workers would participate.  Kamu-Sen President Bircan 
Akyildiz said the strike should be seen as a serious warning to the 
political administration.  He accused the government of trying to 
put the blame for unemployment on the shoulders of the TEKEL 
workers.  He declared that if the GOT continues to be indifferent, 
the protests will continue. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Turk-Is Labor Confederation Press official Sevkutan 
Nevsuhan told us that workers affiliated with unions attached to 
Turk-Is will "consider themselves on leave" February 4.  She 
declined to predict the number of participants, but emphasized that 
all workers of the six labor confederations are involved. 
Meanwhile, Hak-Is labor confederation is somewhat more equivocal. 
Although known to be close to the government, Hak-Is has indicated 
that due to its "responsibilities and principles as a labor 
confederation," it has joined the other confederations in this 
protest.  Hak-Is International Relations Officer Osman Yildiz 
informed us that Hak-Is will issue a statement expressing its 
optimism that a solution will be found prior to the beginning of the 
strike.  Still, the confederation has issued circulars to its 
affiliated unions instructing them to prepare for the work 
stoppage. 
 
¶5. (SBU) An Anatolia News Agency correspondent who follows labor 
issues, Goksel Yildirim, told us that most workers will simply not 
show up for work, but that some would gather in front of Turk-Is 
headquarters to demonstrate their support for the TEKEL workers.  He 
said workers affiliated with DISK will gather in two places in 
Istanbul at 11 a.m., and would march to Sarachane Park to issue a 
press statement.  He noted that at this point it is difficult to 
estimate the scope of participation. 
 
¶6. (U) The first warning to the workers came from the Turkish 
Airlines (THY) administration.  Turkey Civil Aviation Workers Union 
(Hava-Is) issued a circular to its members instructing them to 
participate in the strike tomorrow.  However, THY sent e-mails and 
posted announcements stating that while expressing demands is the 
most natural right of workers, according to the current legislation, 
what they would do on February 4 would be illegal.  THY noted that 
the employment contracts of those who participate in the work 
stoppage may be cancelled.

¶7. (SBU) Meanwhile, an official with the Turkish Employers Unions 
Confederation (TISK) told us, predictably, that TISK does not 
approve of the work stoppage.  He said that national economy will 
suffer, and there would be production losses. He added that the 
employers are not a party to this dispute, and believe that such 
frictions pull labor relations into a deadlock.  He said TISK urges 
the parties to act with common sense and hopes dialogue will 
prevail. 
 
¶8. (SBU) COMMENT:  The TEKEL dispute continues to escalate.  We 
sense a hardening of positions on all sides.  It seems likely that 
this one-day work stoppage will prompt investigations into 
individual cases, as happened after the November 25 general strike. 
Opposition parties will certainly exploit the situation.  The 
government finds itself in an unfamiliar position - pitted against 
workers - and may opt to navigate more carefully in subsequent 
privatization efforts.
