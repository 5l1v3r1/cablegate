HISTORIC CRAFTS 
 
¶1.  Summary: Embassy met a key benchmark in support for Turquoise 
Mountain Trust (TMT) with the February 16 graduation of 30 students 
from a three-year program sponsored by the Turquoise Mountain 
Institute for Afghan Arts and Architecture, the premier institution 
of its kind in the country.  The event marked an important milestone 
in our efforts to assist Afghanistan to regenerate its traditional 
crafts and generate sustainable growth in this sector.  End Summary. 
 
 
¶2.  On February 16, the first class of 30 male and female Afghan 
students from the Schools of Woodwork, Ceramics, and Calligraphy & 
Painting graduated from the three-year course at the Turquoise 
Mountain Institute for Afghan Arts and Architecture.  The event, 
attended by USAID Mission Director and held at Kabul's Moghul-era 
Bagh-e Babur gardens, highlighted Afghanistan's cultural and 
historical heritage, emphasized the gains that have been made in 
reviving this heritage, and instilled a sense of hope by recognizing 
the efforts and promising futures of the young graduates.  The TMT 
program goals are to train designers, craftsmen and entrepreneurs, 
promote creativity and establish the foundation for a broader 
cultural revival.

Restoring Historic Kabul 
------------------------ 
 
¶3.  Afghanistan was once world-renowned for its arts, crafts and 
architecture and Turquoise Mountain was the greatest Afghan capital 
of the Middle Ages.  For Afghans, the name still evokes the 
country's glorious cultural heritage.  Established in 2006 by former 
British diplomat Rory Stewart, Turquoise Mountain Trust has in its 
short life made major strides in reviving Afghanistan's crafts 
traditions after three decades of conflict.  The Trusts's high-end 
projects have successfully recruited the support of senior Afghan 
and international patrons such as President Karzai and the Prince of 
Wales. 
 
¶4.  USAID financial support for TMT began in November 2008 began 
with the economic, social and cultural regeneration of Murad Khane, 
a commercial/residential precinct in Kabul's Old City Center. 
Turquoise Mountain and the local community cleared more than 12,000 
cubic meters of garbage, repaired over 50 houses, installed 330 
meters of drainage, reconstructed eight shops, and paved the area 
for the first time.  TMT is also completing restoration of four 
buildings of architectural or cultural significance, establishing 
Murad Khane as an anchor of Kabul's historic areas and galvanizing 
further development through its restored historic quarter, active 
art and crafts schools, and marketing of Afghan products to domestic 
and international markets.

Strengthening Ancient Crafts 
---------------------------- 
 
¶5.  A recent increase in USG support is enabling the Trust to 
establish the Institute of Afghan Arts and Architecture in Murad 
Khane and ensure its sustainability.  Already the premier training 
centre for traditional arts in Afghanistan, the institute offers 
high quality vocational education programs to artisans in Woodwork, 
Calligraphy and Painting, Jewelry and Gem-cutting, and Ceramics.  By 
2015, TMT aims to meet the total costs of the Institute through a 
combination of revenue from crafts sales and private philanthropic 
contributions. 
 
------------------------- 
Opportunities for Afghans 
------------------------- 
 
¶6.  Under the current agreement with USAID, the Institute will 
provide technical vocational crafts training and complementary 
skills (business, Dari literacy, English, design, regional art 
history and IT) to a total of 200 students over a 5-year period. 
Turquoise Mountain is also establishing a Graduate Opportunities 
Program to provide wide-ranging assistance to its graduates as they 
secure employment and/or study further in Afghanistan and abroad. 
While reviewing a display of the Institute's products and speaking 
with recent graduates, the USAID Director noted the enthusiasm of 
the students and the fact that the vast majority of graduates have 
already secured employment or continuing education positions.  Some 
of the graduates will be placed in Turquoise Mountain Design & 
Production Studio.  The Institute is becoming a source of income, 
skills and pride for Afghan women and men.
