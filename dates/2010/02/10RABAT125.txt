(SBU) PolCouns raised the question of a Moroccan contribution 
to reinforce the MINUSTAH mission with MFA Director General 
for Multilateral Cooperation Nasser Bourita Feb. 5, noting 
that Morocco had contributed to MINUSTAH until 2006.  Bourita 
said that Morocco recognized the humanitarian crisis in Haiti 
and was pleased to have responded with a donation of medical 
supplies as a strictly humanitarian gesture.  However, he 
said, the GOM would not contribute soldiers, gendarmes or 
police to MINUSTAH because of the Haitian government's 2006 
decision to recognize and establish diplomatic ties with the 
Sahrawi Arab Democratic Rebublic (SADR).
