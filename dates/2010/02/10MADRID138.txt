SUBJECT: ANNUAL REQUEST FOR STAFFING, EMPLOYMENT, AND 
BUDGET DATA FOR UNWTO 
 
 ¶1. (U) ECON sent fax and left repeated voicemail messages 
with Carmen Molina, Director of Human Resources at the UN's 
World Tourism Organization, to request the reftel budgetary 
and personnel information. After multiple non-responsive 
inquiries, ECON is forced to assume that as in prior years 
the UNWTO is unwilling to provide information requested since 
the US is not a member. In the past, the UNWTO has informed 
ECON officers that such personnel information is only 
available to members. 
 
¶2. (U) Separately, ECON conducted an extensive internet 
search for the information requested. While no such 
information is readily available on the web, ECON was able to 
ascertain that the UNWTO HQ in Madrid employs approximately 
110 employees, a figure that has not changed from this time 
last year.
