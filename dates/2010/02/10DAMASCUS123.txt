REF: 09 STATE 131995 
 
¶1. This cable provides information on child labor and forced 
labor in the Syrian Arab Republic per reftel. 
 
¶2. Contacts at local international NGOs and children's rights 
activists reported the Syrian Arab Republic Government (SARG) 
kept no official statistics on the prevalence of child labor 
in the country, nor was there evidence the SARG regularly 
monitored industries for evidence of child labor. 
Notwithstanding some allegations in blogs, these same 
contacts do not consider the use of forced or child labor in 
the production of goods to be an appreciable phenomenon in 
Syria and have no statistics suggesting that it is. Anecdotal 
evidence suggests that (1) most child labor occurs among 
intensely poor Syrians and Iraqi refugees who seek to support 
themselves and/or their families by working in the service 
sector or on small farms; and (2) most forced labor occurs in 
the exploitation of foreign domestics living with Syrian 
families. 
 
¶3. The Syrian Commission for Family Affairs continued working 
with relevant NGOs and SARG ministries on a comprehensive 
children's rights law during the reporting period. 
Additionally, in December 2009, the Ministry of Social 
Affairs and Labor agreed to cooperate with the International 
Labor Organization and UNICEF on a three-month national study 
of the worst forms of child labor in the country.
