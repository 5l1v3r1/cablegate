Haiti February 19, and a second CODEL is expected to travel

EVACUATIONS/AMERICAN CITIZEN ISSUES 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Haitian authorities released eight of the ten detained 
Americans February 17; the eight departed Haiti at 2100 on a C- 
130 flight to Miami.  The remaining two Americans are being held 
for further investigation.  Also on the flight were 42 evacuees, 
including three adoptees and one LPR.  There is one flight 
scheduled for February 18 at 2000 which currently is the final 
planned evacuation flight.  (TF-1/Embassy Port-au-Prince e-mail) 
 
¶3. (SBU)  16,704 American citizens have been evacuated as of 
0800 EST.  (TF1/Embassy Port-au-Prince SitRep) 
 
¶4. (SBU)  Spirit Airlines intends to resume fights to Haiti 
February 19 when Port-au-Prince airport reopens for commercial 
service; American Airlines previously announced it would resume 
service the same day.  (Embassy Port-au-Prince/TF-1 e-mail) 
 
¶5. (SBU)  As of 0900 EST there are 103 reported American citizen

HUMANITARIAN UPDATE 
------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU)  The GOH asked the WFP to increase distribution outside 
Port-au-Prince.  The UN Office of Coordination of Humanitarian 
Affairs reports that more than 715,270 (USG-funded) MREs are en 
route to areas outside Port-au-Prince, in addition to ongoing 
food distributions in cities west of Port-au-Prince.  In the 
coming weeks, WFP is also planning food distributions in the 
southeast.  (USAID/DCHA Haiti Earthquake Fact Sheet #36) 
¶7. (SBU)  The USAID funded Famine Early Warning System Network 
and the government of Haiti note that food, including rice, is 
reportedly available for sale at low prices in Port-au-Prince 
markets and settlements sites, reducing demand for imported 
rice, which had risen about 35 percent after the earthquake. 
(USAID/DCHA Haiti Earthquake Fact Sheet #36)

¶8. (SBU)  MINUSTAH/HNP recaptured 138 of the 500 most dangerous 
escaped prisoners.  (SOUTHCOM SitRep) 
 
¶9. (SBU)  The total daily maritime container traffic into Port- 
au-Prince has increased 25 percent since February 15 and is 
close to the port's average weekly pre-earthquake throughput of 
750 TEUs.   (SOUTHCOM SitRep) 
 
¶10. (SBU)  Post anticipates it will need $1.5 million in the 
very near future to cover earthquake-related costs, which 
includes damage to the chancery building, estimated at $750,000. 
(WHA-EX/Embassy Port-au-Prince Conference Call) 
 
POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS 
---------------------- 
 
¶11. (SBU)  The Dominican Republic plans to contribute 150 
peacekeepers to MINUSTAH.  The agreement to provide troops is 
currently under review by the Dominican Minister of Defense and 
must be approved by the Dominican Senate.  (Santo Domingo 59) 
 
¶12. (SBU)  The government of Bolivia confirmed it will replace 
its current 205 peacekeepers supporting MINUSTAH with another 
rotation.  The GOB also offered to send another 200-person 
contingent within the next 60 days.  (La Paz 49)
