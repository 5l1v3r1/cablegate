  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1. U.S.-CHINA ECONOMIC RELATIONS 
 
"It is really difficult to reduce U.S. debt" 
 
Guangdong 21st Century Publishing Company Ltd.'s business newspaper 
21st Century Business Herald (21Shiji Jingji Baodao)(02/26)(pg 2): 
"Data has shown that China's faith in U.S. bonds did not decrease. 
In the future, the momentum for increasing China's holdings of U.S. 
bonds will continue.  As China's foreign reserve increases due to 
the resumption of exports, buying American bonds will still be an 
important method by which to spend a large amount of China's foreign 
exchange reserve.  The so-called 'balance of financial terror' 
between China and the United States is more China's wishful 
thinking.  The financial relationship between China and the United 
States is more like an asymmetrical dependence rather than a 
balanced relationship, which stems from our dependence on exports to 
the U.S. rather than U.S. dependence on imports from us.  China's 
huge holdings of U.S. bonds will not necessarily have a significant 
impact on the U.S. financial markets and/ or asset prices. 
Therefore, it can be said that we have been kidnapped by our own 
economic development model rather than by another country's. 
Although increased holdings of American bonds can assist the U.S. in 
its economic stimulus and financial stabilization plans, due to the 
loose monetary policy of the U.S., their huge deficit and their 
large amount of national bonds, a win-win situation between the two 
is hard to fulfill.  How China will unswervingly safeguard its own 
economic interests deserves our attention." 
 
¶2. U.S.-CHINA MILITARY RELATIONS 
 
a. "The United States: the Defense Secretary's visit to China 
unchanged; China: Sino-U.S. military exchanges temporarily 
suspended" 
 
The official popular newspaper Beijing Youth Daily (Beijing 
Qingnianbao)(02/26)(pg A2): "Huang Xueping, China Defense Ministry 
spokesperson, said at a press conference that China requests the 
U.S. be cautious in its words and deeds.  The U.S.'s arms sales to 
Taiwan severely harmed China's national security and Sino-U.S. 
relations, China has decided to suspend planned arrangements 
relating to any military visits.  China's stance is unchanged.  The 
U.S. should assume full responsibility for the current difficult 
situation in Sino-U.S. military exchanges.  China expects the U.S. 
to take concrete measures and fully respect China's core interests 
and security concerns.  China is also highly concerned about the 
U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency's report about Taiwan's jet 
fighters.  China hopes, currently Sino-U.S. military relations have 
suffered serious interference due to Taiwan arms sales, that the 
U.S. will avoid further harming the bilateral military relationship 
and/ or hinder cross-Strait peace and development.  In regard to the 
Google incident, it is an exaggeration that cyber hackers are 
related to the Chinese military.  The Chinese military network is 
subject to overseas hacker attacks all the time." 
 
b. "Does the U.S. 'C'-shaped attack against China actually exist?" 
 
The People's Daily-sponsored and internationally-focused commercial 
news publication Global Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(02/26)(pg 1): 
"Although American politicians will not hastily launch a war against 
China, it doesn't prevent its military department moving forward 
with plans and military preparations for a potential adversary.  The 
U.S.'s C-shape circle (countries in the strategic circle starting 
from Japan to India and including countries in between) is a 
complete strategic offensive, intending to continuously extort and 
threaten China so as to interfere in China's domestic affairs and 
force China to compromise in economic and other fields.  Such 
besiegement has become a United States negotiation chip when 
fulfilling its national interests and objectives globally.  European 
and Asian countries are all connected by one piece of land; the U.S. 
is an island outside of the Europe-Asia continent.  Therefore, the 
U.S. is vigilant against any country that is possibly capable of 
dominating the Euro-Asian continent.  However, it is still hard to 
make a conclusion about the C-shape besiegement of the U.S. against 
China.  The current Sino-U.S. competition is not a Cold-War like 
confrontation.  The C-shape circle is just a fact because the U.S. 
has military bases in each of those countries.  There is no proof 
that the circle is targeted at China."
