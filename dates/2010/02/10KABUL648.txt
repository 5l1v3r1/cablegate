SUBJECT: AFGHAN OFFICIAL REPORTS PAKISTAN SEEKS TO LIMIT GOODS 
DESTINED FOR AFGHANISTAN 
 
¶1. (SBU) Afghan Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MOCI) Director of 
International Trade told us February 20 that the Government of 
Pakistan's Revenue Division has invoked a clause of its 1969 Customs 
Act which allows it to restrict the transit of 22 categories of 
goods destined to Afghanistan through Pakistan (see para 3 for 
list).  Our MOCI contact said the wide-ranging restrictions will 
take effect on February 26 (fifteen days after the date of the 
Pakistani letter), adding that Finance Minister Omar Zakhilwal is 
preparing a sternly worded response to his Pakistani counterpart, 
Minister of Finance Tareen.  Embassy Kabul will forward Zakhilwal's 
letter to the Department and Embassy Islamabad upon receipt. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: It is unclear what precipitated the Pakistani 
letter.  The majority of the goods mentioned on the list are those 
Islamabad reportedly believes are exported to Afghanistan and 
smuggled back into Pakistan.  Afghan traders are very concerned that 
the restrictions will affect their business.  Business sector 
representatives to the Afghanistan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement 
(APTTA) who met earlier this month in Karachi told us they received 
no indication from their Pakistani counterparts that such 
restrictions were under consideration.  If Islamabad indeed 
implements this step on February 26, it will send a major negative 
signal regarding the APTTA talks, not to mention adding a barrier to 
trade when we have been urging more liberalization.  End Comment.
