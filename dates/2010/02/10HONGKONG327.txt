REF: A. 09 HONG KONG 2175 
     ¶B. 09 HONG KONG 289 
 
¶1. (SBU) On February 6, Hong Kong completed its second and 
final round of public consultations on Financial Action Task 
Force (FATF)-compliant anti-money laundering (AML) 
legislation to codify requirements on customer due diligence 
(CDD) and record keeping.  The proposed legislation would 
also establish a licensing regime for Hong Kong's remittance 
agents and money changers (RAMCs) under oversight from the 
Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department (HKCED).  Financial 
Services and Treasury Bureau (FSTB) Principal Assistant 
Secretary Angelina Kwan told EconOff February 24 that the 
Hong Kong Government would present the draft legislation to 
the Legislative Council (LegCo) in June.  She was optimistic 
LegCo would pass the bill in early 2011 with an 
implementation date of early 2012, after a one-year grace 
period. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Kwan informed us that many of Hong Kong's RAMCs had 
expressed strong concerns during the second round of public 
consultations over compliance costs associated with the 
proposed licensing regime.  They feared the current profits 
of their low-tech operations could not support the 
requirements and would force them to consolidate or go out of 
business, she said.  To deter RAMCs from going underground, 
the proposed legislation would grant search and seizure 
enforcement authority to HKCED and impose strong sanctions on 
those who contravene the legal obligations, including 
criminal liability charges.  The current RAMC registration 
scheme operated by the Hong Kong Police Force only imposes 
fines to those who fail to register. 
 
¶3. (SBU) On the other hand, Hong Kong's banking, securities 
and insurance sectors were very supportive of the proposed 
legislation, Kwan commented.  She added that most of the 
participants in these sectors, many with headquarters in the 
US and Europe, already have internationally accepted 
compliance systems on AML.  The guidelines issued by Hong 
Kong's three existing regulators (Hong Kong Monetary 
Authority, Securities and Futures Commission, and the Office 
of the Commissioner of Insurance) were also compliant with 
FATF and would likely only require minor technical 
adjustments after the law is passed.  The Hong Kong 
Government remained committed to a sound AML regime to retain 
the city's status as an international financial center of 
choice, she stressed.
