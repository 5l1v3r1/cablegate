SUBJECT: DR-based Consortium Presses for Action on Haiti Electricity 
Recovery

REASON: 1.4(B), (D) 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Since the 1/12 earthquake in Haiti, a consortium 
of Dominican electricity companies (and D.R.-based international 
electricity companies) have been working with Electricite de Haiti 
(EDH) to bring the electricity sector in Haiti back on line .  The 
group, calling itself HEART, has conducted a series of 
on-the-ground assessments and worked with EDH to put together a 
proposed 90-day budget.  Although HEART officials were quick to 
caution that the figure may be reduced as a result of private 
sector contributions, the USD 83 million price tag has been 
described as a "gold-plated wish list."  In a 2/2 conference call, 
HEART officials pressed the donor community to secure funding as 
soon as possible, since they have done all they can without said 
funding.  The World Bank agreed to host a meeting in Washington on 
2/5 to discuss.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
 
¶2. (U) Shortly after the earthquake in Haiti, officials from 
Dominican and other D.R.-based international electricity companies 
began working with EDH to assess the damage to the grid and to 
bring the sector back on line.  The group, eventually dubbing 
itself HEART, is comprised of several entities, including:  CDEEE 
(the DR's state-owned electricity authority); the Edes (the three 
companies that control electricity distribution in the DR); and AES 
Dominicana, CEPM, and EGE Haina (three of the largest generators in 
the DR).  On the Haitian side, NRECA, a U.S-based association of 
electricity cooperatives, began working with EDH to help coordinate 
the assessment and establish the budget. 
 
 
 
The Budget:  USD 83 Million and Rising 
 
 
 
¶3. (U) HEART presented the budget request in a 1/29 conference 
call.  The USD 83 million budget covers two distinct needs.  The 
first part details the funds deemed necessary to cover the first 90 
days of emergency recovery operations in the metro Port au Prince 
(PAP) area, estimated at USD 38 million.  It envisions returning 
PAP to the 100 mW level, below the estimated pre-quake peak demand 
of 160 mW.  Areas outside PAP - including the resettlement areas 
that are eventually going to need to be connected to the network - 
are not covered.  The second part covers EDH's operations for the 
same 90 day period, expected to exceed USD 45 million.  This figure 
addresses EDH's needs to run the entire Haitian grid, not just PAP. 
 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) HEART had hoped that donations from the private sector 
would reduce the USD 38 million recovery operation figure.  During 
the 1/29 conference call, a HEART official noted that he would be 
speaking with the U.S.-based Edison Institute to see if any of its 
affiliated companies would be able to donate equipment and manpower 
costs (estimated to exceed USD 6.6 million).  However, in the 
follow-up 2/2 conference call, the official reported on his 
conversation with the Edison Institute, and did not mention an 
agreement to forego those costs.  Instead, he said that he had 
urged the affiliated companies to go to Haiti without payment 
guarantees, saying that the details "could be worked out later." 
Although the companies agreed to begin making initial preparations, 
they stressed three main concerns would have to be addressed fully 
before they would participate:  1) the security of their personnel, 
preferably to be provided by the U.S. Armed Forces; 2) the payments 
of their mobilization costs (including both equipment and 
personnel); and 3) the finalization of logistics for room and board 
for its personnel.  HEART noted that, if donors could cover the 
mobilization and logistic costs now (estimated at USD 3.8 million), 
operations could begin, while a decision on the equipment and 
manpower costs could be worked out later. 
 
 
 
¶5. (U) Furthermore, HEART officials expect that the USD 38 million 
figure will grow, not fall.  This figure was based on EDH's initial 
assessments that all generators were operational.  Upon further 
inspection, generators producing an estimated 60 mW of electricity 
will need to be replaced or repaired, given the discovery of 
fractures in their foundations.  An engineering study still needs 
to be done, but, given that targeted generation is 100 mW, 
reconstructing generators that provide 60 percent of the projected 
load could increase costs significantly.  A HEART official noted 
that some additional generating capacity will come online later 
this year when E-Power's generators are up and running, though some 
doubted whether that could happen by the end of 2010. 
 
 
 
The FUNDS:  HEART Asks for Money Yesterday 
 
 
 
¶6. (SBU) In the 2/2 conference call, HEART officials pressed hard 
for donors to make funds available as soon as possible.  The 
official leading the call noted that most of the crews that had 
gone into Haiti are now demobilizing.  He stressed that, even if 
all the funding were made available today, it would take seven to 
ten days to get teams on the ground with the necessary equipment, 
meaning that any delay in funding pushes back the beginning of 
recovery operations by weeks.  To address the issue, the World Bank 
agreed to convene a meeting between HEART and donors in Washington 
on 2/5. 
 
 
 
The Politics:  The "Much More than 60,000 Dollar" Question 
 
 
 
¶7. (C) COMMENT:  At this stage, HEART wants the money as soon as 
possible, so it can begin mobilizing teams and start the recovery 
process, asserting that economic recovery in Haiti cannot truly 
begin until the electricity grid is back online.  Even after these 
issues are resolved, recovery operations face another challenge. 
Post is aware that both EGE Haina and CEPM are preparing plans to 
run connections into Haiti; on the 1/29 conference call, the head 
of CEPM noted that he could have a line in Haiti in 14 months. 
Several HEART officials have mentioned their ability to supply 
Haiti with electricity for as much as a quarter of the price EDH is 
currently paying.  If the a connection is approved, most here 
assume that competition within HEART for the concession will be 
fierce and could endanger any HEART-coordinated recovery efforts. 
END COMMENT. 
 
 
 
¶8. MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.
