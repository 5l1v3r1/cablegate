SUBJECT: Darfur - One Year After the Humanitarian Organization 
Expulsions 
 
 ¶1. (SBU) Summary:C,B  Nearly one year after the 
Government of National Unity (GNU)-mandated expulsion of 13 
international humanitarian organizations and three local aid 
agencies, the structure of humanitarian assistance provision in 
Darfur has been significantly altered.C,B  Following the expulsions, 
the UN, the GNU, and donors prioritized provision of food aid, 
primary health care, and water, sanitation, and hygiene services.C, 
Remaining relief agencies responded through program expansion in 
priority sectors in order to prevent a humanitarian crisis in 
Darfur.C,B  The GNU elected to support provision of safe drinking 
water and primary health care, but has lacked the capacity and 
resolve necessary to provide services at pre-expulsion levels.C,B  In 
addition, service provision in many other humanitarian sectors 
remains challenging.C,B  The presence of international humanitarian 
staff in field locations has declined significantly due to 
insecurity and bureaucratic impediments resulting in access 
limitations.C,B  End summary.

POST-EXPULSION HUMANIARIAN PROFILE 
---------------------------------- 
 
2.C,B  (SBU) Following the expulsions, the UN, donors, and the GNU 
prioritized basic life-saving services comprising food aid, health, 
and water, sanitation, and hygiene provision.C,B  Post-expulsion 
humanitarian gap-filling strategies focused on UN agencies' role as 
the provider of last resort to support government line-ministries 
in the provision of humanitarian assistance. However, relief 
agencies note that post-expulsion gap-filling activities, including 
line-ministry support, have increased the cost of humanitarian 
programs in Darfur and raised questions regarding the quality of 
services. 
 
3.C,B  (SBU) The GNU has made considerable efforts to provide water 
and health services in areas affected by the expulsions; however, 
UN agencies note that line- ministries operate near the limit of 
their current capacity.C,B  Logistical and human resource systems have 
not yet developed to match service provision requirements and the 
ministries' expanded activities. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Lack of government resources or GNU opposition to 
programming in some sectors has resulted in limited coverage of key 
sectors following the expulsions.C,B  Significantly, and for the first 
time in internally displaced persons (IDP) camps, Sudanese 
government line-ministries, with support from the UN, have provided 
safe drinking water and health care services to replace the work of 
expelled NGOs. However, the Sudanese government has not supported 
sanitation and hygiene activities and nutrition services that 
relief agencies covering corresponding sectors would typically 
provide.C,B  As part of UN efforts to fill post-expulsion nutrition 
service interruptions, UNICEF agreed with the GNU Ministry of 
Health (MoH) to temporarily support MoH nutrition staff salaries 
previously maintained by expelled NGOs; however, UNICEF terminated 
support on December 31, 2009.C,B  UN agencies have encouraged the 
Sudanese government to increase support for neglected sector 
activities, but has not been successful in this effort to date. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Several expelled NGOs had conducted camp management and 
protection activities; however, remaining NGOs were apprehensive to 
take over services without GNU authorization.C,B  Following the 
expulsions, the UN advocated for formal GNU acceptance of the 
Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the UN 
agency mandated under the global humanitarian cluster system to 
lead camp management and coordination, as well as protection 
activities.C,B  To date, the GNU continues to prohibit UNHCR from 
leading protection and camp management and coordination 
activities.C,B  (Note: The GNU has authorized UNHCR to provide refugee 
support services in West Darfur, but the organization remains 
unable to conduct additional activities in the three Darfur States. 
End note.)C,B  Remaining NGOs that previously provided protection 
support have continued to conduct protection activities, including 
support for victims of gender-based violence and development of 
child-friendly spaces. However, open dialogue about protection 
issues remains difficult and NGOs are compelled to conceal 
humanitarian protection programming.C, 
 
¶6. (SBU) Following the expulsions, USAID's Office of US Foreign 
Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA) redistributed funds already 
planned for Darfur to support expansion of UN and NGO partner 
activities providing services previously conducted by expelled 
 
KHARTOUM 00000326  002 OF 002 
 
 
NGOs.C,B  Activities currently conducted through expanded programs 
include health provision, shelter and settlements support, 
agriculture and food security support, logistics and relief 
commodities support, and water, sanitation, and hygiene provision.C, 
In addition, the US Government negotiated admittance of 
international affiliate organizations of three expelled NGOs.C, 
USAID/OFDA continues to monitor the progress of affiliate 
organizations in obtaining seized assets and operationalizing 
provision of necessary humanitarian services.C,

HUMANITARIAN ACCESS AND PROGRAM MONITORING 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶7. (SBU) NGOs remaining after the expulsions have faced declining 
security, including increased incidence of hostage-taking, as well 
as some remaining bureaucratic impediments and access restrictions 
causing organizations to reduce international staff presence and 
hire an increased proportion of national staff to implement field 
activities.C,B  International staff presence has declined most 
significantly in deep field locations.C,B  According to the UN, in 
mid-February 2009, 30 international staff members worked in six 
deep field locations in North Darfur and by mid-February 2010, the 
number had declined to two international staff covering two deep 
field locations in the state.C,B  Many NGOs are establishing remote 
management and monitoring systems in response to increased access 
limitations and insecurity.C,B  In addition, humanitarian 
organizations have raised concerns regarding post-expulsion 
emergency program quality, but due to reduced access organizations 
lack the ability to adequately assess programs.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) Subsequent to the expulsions, humanitarian organizations 
in Darfur, and to some extent Sudanese government line-ministries, 
adapted to ensure delivery of life-saving assistance and 
successfully averted a humanitarian crisis in Darfur.C,B  Nearly 
twelve months following the expulsions the humanitarian situation 
no longer warrants focus on post-expulsion gap filling, but rather 
requires evaluation of program quality and continued planning for 
aid delivery within the existing humanitarian context.C,B  The GNU has 
demonstrated a willingness to support some humanitarian needs 
through primary health care service delivery and safe drinking 
water provision.C,B  However, government efforts reveal the 
limitations of line-ministries to absorb even well-developed 
humanitarian programs.C,B  UN agencies continue to support ministry 
capacity building, but the process requires additional time and 
resources.C,B  As other critical needs remain, including nutrition, 
food security, and humanitarian protection, additional GNU 
engagement and support will be required.C,B  USAID/OFDA continues to 
support the UN in advocating for improved GNU engagement in all 
humanitarian sectors.
