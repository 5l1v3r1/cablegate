¶1. Econpoloff discussed reftel points January 29 with Gerlinde 
Paschinger, MFA Human Rights Unit Chief of Minority Rights, Thomas 
Unger, from the Human Rights division of the MFA Office of the Legal 
Advisor, and Gerrit Ach, MFA Human Rights Desk Officer.  Paschinger 
said   the MFA had called in the Iranian Ambassador the previous 
week as part of an EU-wide demarche on human rights in Iran.  MFA 
officials at the meeting raised concerns over the persecution of the 
Baha'i, abuse of young women, and Iran's obligation to protect 
defenders of human rights.  Austria has yet to formulate its 
intervention on Iran's Universal Periodic Review (UPR), but will 
likely continue to press Iran on human rights, either as part of an 
EU effort or bilaterally, Paschinger said.   Austria was also 
supportive of U.S. efforts in Geneva.  Paschinger said Austria was 
particularly interested in pressing Iran to accept a visit from UN 
Special Rapporteur on Torture Manfred Nowak, who is also the 
Director of the Vienna-based Boltzmann Institute for Human Rights. 
 
 
¶2.    Unger said Austria planned to use Canada's resolution on Iran 
passed through the UNGA Third Committee as a start for its dialogue. 
 However, Unger suggested that Austria would prefer to support a 
resolution on Iran that passed with broad-based geographical 
support. 
 
¶3.  As an aside, Unger noted that since the Human Rights Council 
(HRC) was relatively new and up for review in 2011, the GOA was 
interested in knowing the USG's plans regarding the HRC review. 
(Note: Austria will run for the HRC in 2011.)
