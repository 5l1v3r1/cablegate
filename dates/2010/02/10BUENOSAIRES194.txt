SUMMARY 
 
------- 
 
 
 
¶1.   Although Europe's financial troubles continue to dominate 
international news sections, several U.S. topics also made 
headlines.  Articles characterized China's disapproval of the Dalai 
Lama's visit to the U.S. as a sign that China "wants to be heard" 
on key international issues.  In addition, a pro-government 
newspaper ran reports about eight of the 10 Americans being 
released from Haiti, as well as a story about the U.S. not giving 
Colombian torture victims justice.  Two opinion articles criticized 
U.S. foreign policy, calling it a "double-standard" in regards to 
Iran's nuclear program, and nearly non-existent in Latin America. 
End summary. 
 
 
 
DALAI LAMA IN WASHINGTON 
 
------------------------ 
 
 
 
¶2.   China's growing influence on U.S. policy was the focus of 
largest-circulation daily Clarin's coverage of the Dalai Lama's 
visit.  Washington correspondent Ana Baron points out that while it 
is a "ritual" for China to complain every time the Dalai Lama 
visits the U.S., China now "wants to be heard" and that China's 
growth in power is "proportional to the decline of the power of the 
U.S."  However, Baron writes that the U.S. "needs China more than 
vice versa" when it comes to issues such as Iran, North Korea, and 
financing "the enormous fiscal deficit" the U.S. "suffers" from.

¶3.   Centrist Critica's Washington correspondent, Silvia Ayuso, 
reported on President Obama's meeting with the Dalai Lama on 2/18. 
Although meeting the Dalai Lama is a "White House tradition," Ayuso 
highlights "explicit warnings" from China that the meeting 
threatens U.S-China relations regarding Iran and the world economy, 
both "key" issues for the U.S.  The article also quoted a 
Washington Post opinion article by Carl Gershman ("National 
Foundation for Democracy") supporting the meeting, as the Dalai 
Lama is someone who "shares the most profound values" with the 
U.S., such as democracy and human rights.

U.S. vs. IRAN 
 
------------- 
 
 
 
¶4.   Juan Gelman, columnist for left-leaning Pagina 12, opines that 
the U.S. is being too harsh on Iran and that it holds a "double 
standard" between Iran's nuclear program and that of its allies. 
Gelman questions why the U.S. is putting so much pressure on Iran 
when "none of the 16 U.S. spy services" estimate Iran has the 
capability to build a nuclear bomb right now.  This is especially 
true since Germany is the country with the most "nuclear armory" 
and "thanks to the work of the Pentagon," there are several 
European countries with "undeclared nuclear arsenals."  However, 
neither of these facts "will stop Berlin from supporting sanctions 
against Tehran."

AMERICANS RELEASED FROM HAITIAN JAIL 
 
------------------------------------ 
 
 
 
¶5.   The eight Americans released from jail in Haiti received a 
small mention in Pagina 12.  The article notes that Haitian 
 
 
officials still are interrogating two Americans who were in Haiti 
prior to the earthquake on January 12.  Pagina 12 gives a summary 
of the case so far, noting that it began when the Americans tried 
bringing 33 orphans into the Dominican Republican, but 
"suspiciously, they could not demonstrate" that the children were 
indeed orphans.

U.S. FOREIGN POLICY IN LATIN AMERICA 
 
------------------------------------ 
 
 
 
¶6.   Conservative Buenos Aires Economico covered a speech critical 
of U.S. foreign policy in Latin America given by Georgetown 
University Professor Michael Shifter at the University of Palermo, 
Buenos Aires.  Although he is a "supporter of the President," 
Shifter observed that Latin America fell to "sixth or seventh 
place" on the President's agenda, and that "neither Obama nor 
Secretary Clinton has visited South America."  As for Argentina, 
Shifter notes that Argentina's positions against terrorism and 
Iran's nuclear program "help avoid deterioration in relations," but 
that there is also "much uncertainty." 
 
 
 
¶7.   An investigative article about Colombian paramilitants being 
extradited to the U.S. appeared in Pagina 12.  The article, based 
on a human rights report from the University of California 
Berkeley, says that since the paramilitants were extradited in May 
2008, "without advising anyone," there has been no information 
given to the victims about their cases.  This is despite the 
promises of U.S. Ambassador William Brownfield, who had promised 
victims, lawyers, and Colombian judges information in order to 
"advance justice against human rights violations."
