SUMMARY 
 
-------------- 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) On February 19, the Secretary General of the General 
Agriculture and Plantation Workers' Union of Zimbabwe (GAPWUZ), 
Gertrude Hambira, was interrogated by a group of 17 security 
officials for her part in producing a film documenting abuse 
suffered by farm workers in Zimbabwe.  During the interrogation, 
senior security officers intimidated and threatened the leader of 
the farm workers' union and her lawyer.  On Wednesday February 24, 
GAPWUZ's office was raided.  Hambira fears she and GAPWUZ may face 
further action by the government in retaliation for the 
documentary. END SUMMARY.

Farm Workers Union Leader Interrogated

¶2. (SBU) On Friday February 19, Gertrude Hambira, the Secretary 
General of GAPWUZ appeared before a group of security officials 
representing the Joint Operations Command (JOC) at the request of 
an assistant commissioner of police. 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) According to Hambira, she and her lawyer ,Trust Maanda 
from Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights , appeared for about 45 
minutes before a group of 17 security officials from the army, 
police, prison service, and intelligence services.  Deputy Police 
Commissioner Innocent Matibiri (who is President Mugabe's nephew) 
led the questioning.   Matibiri began by asking about the video and 
report "House of Justice" that was produced by GAPWUZ in 
conjunction with another local organization, the Research and 
Advocacy Unit with assistance from the U.S.-based organization 
Witness.  "House of Justice" was first shown to a group of 
diplomats in Harare in October (reftel) and has since been shown in 
numerous settings internationally and is also on the internet on 
You Tube and other websites.  (NOTE: The documentary is online at: 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqOjiq19rHk. END NOTE.) 
 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) Matibiri asked Hambira why she made the video rather than 
reporting the issue to the Joint Operational Command ( JOC).  He 
asked who "gave her the authority" to make the documentary.  The 
interrogators also told Hambira that the video dealt with human 
rights issues "not trade union issues" and accused her of 
overstretching her bounds.  An army official known as Chedundu 
heckled, "These people are dangerous.  Are there any rooms in the 
cells?  We should put them in the cells right now."  They also 
warned Maanda that he needed to be careful if he was going to 
associate with such dangerous people. 
 
 
 
¶5. (SBU) The group asked Hambira about her funding sources.  (NOTE: 
She did not disclose that GAPWUZ receives funding from any 
government.  END NOTE.)  They also asked how far the video had 
gone, specifically asking if the video had been given to the 
Southern Africa Development Community.  At the end of the meeting, 
they told Hambira that they would call her back.  When we met with 
Hambira on February 22, she indicated her office had already taken 
measures to increase security but that GAPWUZ needed additional 
measures to protect the security of its data. 
 
 
 
¶6. (SBU) Hambira told us she had reported the incident to Zimbabwe 
Congress of Trade Unions' President Lovemore Matombo, who promised 
to raise the incident with the Minister of Labor.

GAPWUZ Office Raided; Hambira Hiding 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
 
 
¶7. (SBU) At noon on February 24, GAPWUZ's office in downtown Harare 
was raided by security officials looking for documents and for 
Hambira.  Hambira was out of the office at the time and is in a 
safe place.

COMMENT 
 
-------------- 
 
 
 
¶8. (SBU) The security service team's interrogation of Hambira has 
sent a shiver through many in civil society who see it as a harsh 
reminder that the security environment remains tenuous for those 
who speak out against the security forces and ZANU-PF.  It is 
unclear why the JOC has taken such a sudden interest now - months 
after the video was released and shown to a wide audience.  We 
suspect someone senior in government just learned about the 
documentary and was angry to learn that the security forces had 
done nothing to block it.  Regardless of the reasons why, this 
intimidation of GAPWUZ is evidence that the security forces' 
attitude towards labor unions has not changed.
