  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1. U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS 
 
"The United States exagerates that China is the top network threat" 
 
 
The People's Daily-sponsored and internationally-focused commercial 
news publication Global Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(02/24)(pg 3): "Tang 
Lan, expert of information security at the China Institute of 
Contemporary International Relations said that generally speaking, 
at the beginning of every year the United States focuses on certain 
topics to exaggerate against China.  The Google incident is their 
exaggeration for this year.  The United States is trying to portray 
China to the international community as a public enemy in the area 
of network security.  However, the negative impact of the U.S. 
exaggeration concerning China's hacking attacks will be limited and 
temporary.  In fact the U.S. is trying to use the issue to contain 
China's rise.  Most countries know the intention of the U.S., and 
therefore they stayed calm and did not follow in the U.S.'s 
footsteps.  The Russian media commented that there is also a 
controversy inside the U.S. about this issue.  Some believed that 
China was neither here nor there concerning the hacker attack and 
that the issue was purposefully exaggerated up by a third country." 
 
¶2. DALAI LAMA MEETING 
 
"A meeting hidden in the White House Map Room" 
 
Guangdong 21st Century Publishing Company Ltd.'s business newspaper 
21st Century Business Herald (21Shiji Jingji Baodao)(02/23)(pg 3): 
"Dr. Wang Jinjiang from Fudan University's School of International 
Relations and Public Affairs said that the newly declassified U.S. 
diplomatic archives show that from the very beginning, Tibet's armed 
rebellions were supported by U.S. anti-China forces.  Zhang Zhirong 
from the Institute of International Relations at Beijing University 
said that, before 1943, the U.S.'s Tibet policy was very clear, 
admitting Tibet is a part of China.  However, along with the U.S.'s 
additional involvement in the Tibet issue, its attitude has also 
become vague.  Dr. Wang also said, in the end of 1960, that 
decreasing aid to the Dalai clique was one positive change that the 
Nixon government made while improving Sino-U.S. relations while 
fighting against the former Soviet Union.  Every American president 
who met the Dalai Lama has emphasized the private nature of their 
meeting.  In fact, all along, the White House has not been concerned 
about the Tibet issue but rather the United States' own interests." 
 
 
¶3. TAIWAN 
 
"The U.S. exaggerates when stating that the Taiwanese air force is 
vulnerable" 
 
The People's Daily-sponsored and internationally-focused commercial 
news publication Global Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(02/24)(pg 16): "A 
Pentagon report described Taiwan's defense capability as very 
vulnerable. This is not the first time that the U.S. has tried to 
use the cross-Strait imbalance in military strength to scare Taiwan. 
 Experts believe that this report was written to make the case for 
selling its F-16 fighter airplanes to Taiwan.  Yu Wanli from Beijing 
University said that, up till now, it is not quite likely that the 
U.S. will sell Taiwan F-16s.  The U.S. has clearly promised not to 
sell Taiwan large-scale offensive weapons, including F-16s. However, 
if the U.S. eats its words [that it promises not to sell Taiwan its 
F-16s] and goes ahead with the sale anyway, China will not accept 
this and will conduct severe countermeasures.  Wang Jianmin, a China 
Academy of Social Science researcher, also said that the report is 
very unusual. The U.S. may use the report as a means to deeply 
interfere with the strategic layout of Taiwan.  By extorting China, 
the U.S. will fulfill their bigger political plot."
