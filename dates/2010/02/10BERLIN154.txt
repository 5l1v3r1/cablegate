SUBJECT: GERMAN MFA SUPPORTS PACE MISSION BUT FEARS TIME IS 
RUNNING SHORT 
 
REF: STATE 7158 
 
¶1. (U) On January 29, poloffs delivered reftel demarche to 
MFA office director for Iraq, Klemens Semtner.  Semtner 
said that the MFA had engaged with German PACE 
representatives in support of the UNAMI invitation for an 
observer mission.  However, his office had not yet received 
any feedback.  Semtner was downbeat on prospects for 
support given the lack of a PACE footprint in Iraq and the 
fact that the EU, which does have an office in country, had 
failed to put together an official mission -- opting, 
instead for an experts delegation.  Moreover, he feared 
that it might already be too late for PACE to act given 
that the election was just over a month away. 
Nevertheless, he welcomed U.S. efforts.  For his part, 
Semtner noted that the MFA will have one election observer 
on the ground in Baghdad and a handful in the north of Iraq 
-- possibly on detail from Berlin.  He also told poloffs 
that the German-based Ebert Foundation ran a program that 
trained nearly 14,000 Iraqi election observers. 
 
 
¶2. (U) On February 2 poloff delivered reftel points to 
Alexander Troche, Deputy Head for Protocol for the 
President of the German Bundestag Norbert Lammert.  Troche 
had no immediate response but promised to flag this issue 
for Lammert immediately.
