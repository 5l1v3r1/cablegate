S/R Bosworth Visit to China 
--------------------------- 
 
¶2. At the February 25 regularly scheduled Foreign Ministry press 
briefing, Spokesperson Qin Gang announced that Foreign Minister Yang 
Jiechi and Special Representative Wu Dawei met in Beijing with 
visiting Special Representative Ambassador Stephen Bosworth to 
exchange views on the Six-Party Talks.  Qin noted that the six 
parties were presented with a "good opportunity to work out of a 
dilemma."  China would maintain close coordination and consultations 
with all parties involved to push for an early resumption of the 
Six-Party Talks. 
 
Arms Sales to Taiwan 
------------------- 
 
¶3. Qin stated that U.S. arms sales to Taiwan were a "gross 
violation" of the three Joint Communiques, specifically the August 
17 Communique.  The arms sales undermined China's national security 
and disrupted the peace, stability, and development of cross-Strait 
relations, and would "gravely" affect U.S.-China military exchanges, 
Qin said. China's decision to suspend military exchanges remained 
unchanged Qin said, adding that the "people who tied this knot 
should untie this knot."  China urged the United States to take 
concrete measures to address China's concerns in order to develop 
healthy relations. 
 
China's Foreign Exchange Reserves 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶4. When asked about how China's recent reduction of  U.S. Treasury 
securities holdings, Qin said that China would invest its foreign 
exchange reserves based on market considerations with the aim of 
maintaining the value of its holdings and the security and liquidity 
of its foreign exchange reserves.  He noted that the United States 
should take "effective steps" to ensure confidence in the dollar. 
 
India-Pakistan Relations 
------------------------ 
 
¶5. In response to reports of a resumption of ministerial level 
meetings by Pakistan and India, Qin stated that China hoped dialogue 
and consultations between India and Pakistan would bring substantive 
results and continued momentum.  India and Pakistan were both major 
neighboring countries whose stability, peace, and development affect 
not only South Asia, but the whole region, said Qin. 
 
 
Cyber Attacks 
-------------- 
 
¶6. Qin noted that the Chinese law strictly prohibited cyber attacks 
and cyber crimes and that China was also a victim of cyber attacks. 
Qin characterized Google's allegations of a PRC government role in 
hacking attacks against its systems as "baseless." Qin said that 
China operates within the boundaries of law. 
 
Iran Nuclear Program 
-------------------- 
 
¶7. China believed that there was still room for diplomatic efforts 
and dialogue in responding to achieve the peaceful resolution of the 
Iran nuclear issue.
