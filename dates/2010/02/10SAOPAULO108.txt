"The Knot of Iran Sanctions" 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (2-10) notes: 
"....If [sanctions against Iran] cause substantial damage to the 
Iranian economy they will probably lead to a boomerang effect of 
reducing the opposition's antagonism against the repressive 
Ahmadinejad government.  We have seen this move in Cuba.  Lastly, 
the previous punishment approved by the Security Council did not 
hinder the development of the Iranian nuclear program or of its 
arms industry......Brazil will oppose sanctions.....So far the only 
effect of Brazil having more importance on the international scene 
is that the country doesn't have the maturity to perform the role 
it aims for."
