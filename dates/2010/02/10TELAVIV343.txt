Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Yesterday leading media reported that Vice President Joe Biden is 
expected to visit Israel next week. 
 
Israel Hayom and other media reported that yesterday at JerusalemQs 
Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, expressed his commitment that the 
Holocaust will not repeat itself.  The media reported that yesterday 
in Tel Aviv, Mullen told members of the IDFQs humanitarian 
delegation to Haiti: QI want to express my admiration for you.... 
You created hope and a future for those people and humanity is proud 
of you. 
 
The media reported yesterday PM Benjamin Netanyahu called for 
"crippling sanctions" against Iran over its nuclear program after a 
meeting with Russia's top officials, whom he praised for showing "an 
understanding" over the issue.  Russia has generally resisted new 
sanctions, but has shown increasing frustration over the past week 
as Iran proceeds with uranium enrichment despite international 
pressure. Critics say the enrichment is aimed at producing nuclear 
weapons.  The Jerusalem Post reported that Russian news agencies 
made no mention of Iran in reports of Russian President Dmitry 
Medvedev's opening remarks at his meeting with Netanyahu.  Israel 
wants "sanctions and sanctions that have teeth," Netanyahu said, 
calling for a blockade on Tehran's energy trade. "The sanctions have 
to focus on the importing and exporting of fuel."  Media reported 
that Medvedev told his Israeli visitor that Russia will hold off on 
delivering an advanced air defense system, the S-300, to Iran. Just 
before Netanyahu arrived in Moscow, the media quoted a senior 
Russian official as saying that the arms deal would take place. 
 
Citing the AP, The Jerusalem Post reported that Congressman Brian 
Baird (D-WA) told Gaza students on Sunday that the U.S. should break 
IsraelQs blockade of Gaza and deliver badly needed supplies by sea. 
 
All media highlighted the release by the Dubai police of a video 
showing the hit squad suspected of assassinating senior Hamas 
official Mahmoud al-Mabhouh on January 20.  The group reportedly 
carried European passports.  The media quoted Arab sources as saying 
that they still suspect Israel of carrying out the murder. 
Conversely, Israel Radio cited mutual accusations in the matter 
between Hamas and Fatah.  On Sunday HaQaretz quoted the London Times 
as saying on Saturday that Israel is waging an assassination 
campaign across the Middle East. 
 
Media quoted Deputy FM Daniel Ayalon as saying in an interview with 
the Arabic-language newspaper, Asharq al-Awsat, that placing Israeli 
Arabs under Palestinian sovereignty in the context of a land swap 
would be to the PalestiniansQ benefit.  His remarks drew anger 
comments from Israeli Arab politicians. 
 
Over the weekend the media dealt with the aftermath of leaked 
deprecating remarks about judges made a few months ago by Attorney 
Uri Korb of the Jerusalem prosecution team and a possible delay in 
former PM Ehud OlmertQs trial.  Media reported that on Sunday Olmert 
confirmed a media report and comments by Turkish officials that in 
December 2008 Israel was about to start direct negotiations with 
Syria.  Leading media reported that on Sunday Olmert told the 
business-academic forum at Tel Aviv University that QI offered a 
solution in JerusalemQthe Jewish parts would be IsraelQs and the 
Arab parts would be in the Palestinian state.Q  In addition, it was 
implied by OlmertQs statements that he was opposed to a military 
strike on Iran. 
 
Makor Rishon-Hatzofe reported that hundreds of Israelis with origins 
in Arab countries convened at the Knesset yesterday, demanding that 
compensation be granted to Jews who were expelled from those 
countries and forced to abandon their property. 
 
HaQaretz reported that yesterday PM Netanyahu asked Russian 
President Dmitry Medvedev to tell Hamas that Israel will not sweeten 
its offer for kidnapped soldier Gilad Shalit.  Netanyahu reportedly 
told Medvedev that Israel wants to make a deal for Shalit, but he 
will not agree to release more Palestinian prisoners than he already 
has.  The Russian President offered Moscow's help in the talks. 
 
Yediot quoted Luis Moreno-Ocampo, the General Prosecutor of the 
International Court of Justice in The Hague, as saying yesterday 
that if Israel conducts a thorough and sincere inquiry into 
Operation Cast Lead, there will be no grounds for the court starting 
an investigation of its own. 
 
On Sunday, HaQaretz reported that the Israeli human rights 
organization Shurat Hadin Q Israel Law Center is filing a suit 
against North Korea over a 1972 terrorist attack at Lod (now 
Ben-Gurion) International Airport that left more than 20 people dead 
and over 50 wounded.  The lawsuit stems from claims that North Korea 
sponsored the FPLP and the Japanese Red Army, providing material 
support to both organizations and assistance in planning the 
attack. 
 
The media quoted Kadima chair Tzipi Livni as saying yesterday that 
she opposes holding party primaries at this time and that those 
should take place during an election year. 
 
Major media reported that British Liberal Democrat Party leader Nick 
Clegg has sacked controversial peer Baroness Jenny Tonge as his 
health spokeswoman in the House of Lords after she suggested last 
week that Israel set up an inquiry if it wants to refute allegations 
that its medical teams in Haiti QharvestedQ organs of earthquake 
victims. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that a coalition of Orthodox Jewish 
groups is appealing for clemency on behalf of Martin Grossman, a 
Jewish inmate on FloridaQs death row who is scheduled to be executed 
tonight.  He was convicted of first-degree murder for killing a 
Florida wildlife officer in 1984.

¶I.  QA Friendly Warning 
 
The independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz editorialized (2/16): QIsrael 
should heed the friendly warning it received from the Obama 
administration, which opposes a preemptive Israeli attack on Iran's 
nuclear facilities.... The likelihood that the American move will 
succeed is unclear, but Israel is required to give Obama a chance, 
for one simple reason: Israel will need full American support for 
any actions it may decide to take against the Iranian threat.  If 
Israel goes to war, it will need intelligence help, prior warning, 
military equipment and diplomatic support from the United States. 
No other country would or could aid Israel, and uncoordinated 
Israeli action would justifiably arouse U.S. anger, since it would 
endanger America's vital interests in the region.  Thus, despite all 
the anger and fear that Ahmadinejad's threats raise in Israel, for 
now, Israel should respond quietly and let Obama lead the effort to 
stop the Iranian nukes.  Netanyahu has no better option. 
 
II.  QThe Americans DonQt Trust Us 
 
Military correspondent Alex Fishman wrote in the mass-circulation, 
pluralist Yediot Aharonot (2/16): QBeneath the hugs, the kisses, the 
smiles and the glittering visits, the Americans donQt trust us, they 
hear Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu telling them, emphatically, 
that the Iranian nuclear capability is an existential threat to 
Israel, and they are very worried.  They fear that Israel will not 
be sufficiently sensible, that it will not properly assess the side 
effects of a military strike on Iran -- fire on various fronts, for 
example, in the north against Hizbullah and the Syrians, shock and 
collapse of Arab regimes in the region.  Admiral Mullen took a very 
unusual step in American diplomatic conduct.  He began his visit to 
Israel with a surprising and unscheduled press conference, in the 
course of which he spoke very specifically about the unwanted 
effects of a strike on Iran.  In his meetings with the Chief of 
Staff, with the IDF General Staff and with the Defense Minister, he 
most likely spoke more explicitly.  Biden, in his visit, will put 
less of an emphasis on the Defense Ministry and the IDF, and more on 
the Prime Minister and Israeli public opinion.  The sanctions on 
Iran are getting closer.... The U.S. could impose sanctions even 
without the U.N. Security Council, but a resolution of the U.N. 
Security Council on sanctions, tepid as it may be, will give the 
U.S. an umbrella for escalating steps against Iran.... The region is 
entering a new stage in the confrontation with Iran.  It is going up 
a step. And the Americans are sending the QnanniesQ to maintain 
discipline.

¶I.  QQuick, Look Busy! 
 
The Director of the Interdisciplinary Center's Global Research in 
International Affairs Center, columnist Barry Rubin, wrote in the 
conservative, independent Jerusalem Post (2/15): QSecretary of State 
Hillary Clinton issued a nominally routine communiqu last week 
after her meeting with Tony Blair, former Prime Minister of Great 
Britain and now messenger of the Quartet on Israeli-Palestinian 
matters.  This two-paragraph document, dated February 11, 2010, 
indicates the new direction of U.S. policy on 
Israel-Palestinian/Arab-Israeli conflict issues.  It, somewhat 
disingenuously, defines the Obama administration policy as seeking a 
two-state solution right from the start through three tactics: Q(1) 
To help build the economy and capacity to govern a Palestinian 
state; (2) to renew political negotiations to enable the earliest 
possible establishment of that state; and (3) to achieve these in a 
manner that ensures the security of Israel and of the Palestinians. 
 Wait a minute!  Up until now, item two has been in the top 
position.  Last September, the President announced that intensive 
talks to reach a comprehensive peace agreement would start in early 
November!  Three months later, not even the most minor direct talks 
are in sight.  So now the administration has shifted gears and the 
main priority is a process of state-building and community 
organizing among Palestinians to get them ready for statehood. 
 
II.  QPaving Peace 
 
Former Meretz leader, former Justice Minister, and chief Israeli 
promoter of the Geneva Initiative, Yossi Beilin, wrote in the 
independent Israel Hayom (2/16) : QRawabi (QHillsQ), the first 
planned Palestinian city being built north of Ramallah is the 
largest economic project in the West Bank.... Rawabi is a 
Palestinian dream but it is equally an Israeli dream.... The Israeli 
Government should have made extraordinary efforts to assist the 
establishment of this fascinating project.  In some ways it is doing 
so.... But this is only happening ostensibly.... If the [access] 
road to Rawabi is not built [due to political considerations 
involving the definitions of Area A vs. Area C around Rawabi], the 
new city will not materialize.... If the intention is to bring about 
at least economic peace, something must be done about this.... In 
case of failure] we, who can bring neither a diplomatic nor an 
economic peace, will find ourselves in a new confrontation with a 
frustrated public.  Once again, we wonQt understand why this is 
happening to nice people like us.

QInnocence or Folly? 
 
Avraham (Avi) Ben-Zvi, visiting Professor of Political Science at 
Haifa University and an expert in U.S.-Israel relations, wrote in 
the independent Israel Hayom (2/16) : +In U.S. thinking, the Taliban 
movement may undergo a mutation or a metamorphosis after the battle 
over Marja puts it in its proper place and makes it grasp the limits 
of its power and its influence.  With all the initial charm inherent 
in this dialectic logic, this is an innocent American attempt to sow 
a pragmatic, practical approach in the very complex Afghan 
experience.  But TalibanQs history in Afghanistan and that of 
similar asymmetrical wars indicate that military weakness does not 
necessarily cultivate political moderation.
