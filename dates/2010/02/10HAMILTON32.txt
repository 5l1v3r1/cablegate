SUBJECT: BERMUDA INSURERS REVERSE 2008 LOSSES WITH HUGE POFITS IN 
2009 
 
Â¶1.      (U) The February 22 edition of the daily Royal Gazette 
reported that 17 U.S.-listed property and casualty re/insurance 
companies based on the Island reversed 2008 losses of just over 
USD one billion with high profits of USD 11.7 billion in 2009. 
The list of 17 did not include London-listed insurers or the 900 
plus concerns in the captive insurance sector, which  provide 
self-insurance for their own companies.  The companies achieved 
their stellar earnings partly because of the rebound in the 
global financial markets that had crashed in 2008, resulting in 
higher returns on their large investment portfolios, and partly 
because there were fewer catastrophes in 2009.   In comparison, 
2008 hurricanes Gustav and Ike generated USD 20 billion in 
insurance claims.  The 2009 profits should serve to bolster the 
local economy as the insurance companies in Bermuda awarded 
large bonuses, according to the daily.  The paper predicted, 
however, a return to smaller profits in 2010 as claims from 
winter storms start coming in.
