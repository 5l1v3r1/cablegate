¶1. (SBU) During a brief introductory call, Indian Consul General 
Indra Mani Pandey expressed surprise and dismay over the lack of 
access to senior local government and communist party leadership. 
Shortly after arriving on January 20, he placed requests to meet 
Guangdong Party Secretary Wang Yang as well as Governor Huang 
Huahua.  He opined that Guangdong's Foreign Affairs Office had yet 
to respond to those requests or even offer a meeting with Vice 
Governor.  Pandey said he doubted the delays were due to either 
Chinese New Year holidays or recent border dust ups between India 
and China, assigning the blame to indifference and bureaucracy.   He 
observed that China routinely took the U.S. and India to task over 
the Dalai Lama. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Pandey estimated around 10,000 Indian citizens resided in 
his consular district, which includes the provinces of Fujian, 
Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, Yunnan, Sichuan, and Hunan.  He 
understood nearly 3,000 are university students and that most attend 
medical schools in Guangdong.  A handful of small Indian-invested 
firms had sprung up, such as restaurants and yoga training centers, 
but Indian businessmen complained about China's complex, confusing, 
and opaque investment and business environment.  Trade between south 
China and India is growing, Pandey said, with China importing Indian 
raw materials and exporting machinery.  He predicted limited 
bilateral trade growth as the two countries are largely competitors 
producing similar products, in his view. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Bio info:  Pandey speaks Arabic and has had tours in Cairo, 
Damascus, Kabul, Islamabad, and Geneva; he does not speak Chinese. 
His wife Sushma and daughter accompanied him to Guangzhou from his 
most recent assignment in New Delhi.  Pandey said he is on friendly 
terms with Pakistani Consul General Mohammad Iftikhar Anjum as the 
two live in the same apartment complex and their Consulate offices 
are in close proximity.
