¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  Macedonia is committed to solving the name 
dispute with Greece, but Athens must also compromise, PM Gruevski 
told Senators Voinovich and Shaheen Feb 17.  Gruevski outlined his 
government's continuing commitment to Euro-Atlantic integration and 
his efforts to reach out to Greek PM Papandreou.  Senators Voinovich 
and Shaheen praised Macedonia's progress in building a multiethnic 
state and expressed U.S. gratitude for Macedonia's contributions to 
Afghanistan.  They urged that Macedonia and Greece reach an 
agreement on the name issue urgently.  (End Summary) 

¶2. (SBU) Senators George Voinovich and Jeanne Shaheen paid a brief 
visit to Skopje Feb 17, meeting Ambassador Reeker and the Country 
Team, then PM Gruevski.  Gruevski opened the meeting by thanking the 
United States for its continued friendship and support for 
Macedonia's NATO accession.  The PM assured the Senators that 
Macedonia remained fully committed to solving the name issue and 
joining NATO.  He also noted that he had reached out to Greek PM 
Papandreou by phone in order to establish a dialogue with him in 
order to resolve the issue, and offered to meet Papandreou at the 
latter's convenience.  Gruevski said Macedonia would do its best to 
resolve the name dispute with Greece in the first half of 2010 but 
felt that a resolution would be almost impossible without the help 
of the international community, and especially the U.S.  He also 
lamented the difficult political situation he was faced with in 
solving the name issue, claiming the Greeks wanted also to "change 
our identity."  Gruevski repeated that it was in Macedonia's best 
interests to have positive relations with Greece, but any solution 
would have to be acceptable to the citizens in both countries.  In 
Macedonia, any agreement would require holding a referendum. 

¶3. (SBU) Senators Voinovich and Shaheen both expressed their 
gratitude to the PM for Macedonia's continued contributions to NATO 
and the international peacekeeping mission in Afghanistan.  They 
also emphasized the importance of Macedonia's speedy accession to 
NATO, both for Macedonia's as well as the Alliance's future. 
Senator Voinovich told the PM that Washington was committed to 
helping Macedonia find a resolution to the name issue and stressed 
to the PM that it was critical that it be resolved as quickly as 
possible.  Both Senators said they believed Macedonia's window of 
opportunity for finding a resolution was closing.  Senator Voinovich 
said Greek PM Papandreou showed a clear understanding of how 
important an expedient resolution to the name issue was during their 
recent meeting and that this created an opportunity for Gruevski. 
Senator Voinovich also said he was concerned that any political 
fallout from the economic crisis in Greece would distract attention 
from the name issue and therefore made a quick resolution even more 
important.  Both Senators told Gruevski that if he and Papandreou 
made solving the issue a top priority and showed strong leadership a 
resolution could be achieved.
