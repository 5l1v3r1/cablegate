On January 27, ESTHoffs delivered reftel demarche to Igor Zotov, 
Deputy Director of the Department of International Cooperation at 
the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MNRE). 
On February 5, Natalya Vavilova of MNRE's International Department 
told us that the Ministry is preparing an interim response 
acknowledging receipt of the U.S. information on CITES proposals. 
MNRE is planning an interagency meeting at the end of February to 
develop a coordinated Russian position on CITES issues.  Based on 
the result of the meeting, MNRE will issue instructions to its CITES 
CoP 15 delegation and will respond to the U.S. proposals 
accordingly.  We will follow up with MNRE officials regarding the 
results of the meeting.
