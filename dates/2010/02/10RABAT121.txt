SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR AND MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE 
DISCUSS MCA, TOMATOES AND WATER MANAGEMENT 
 
¶1.  Summary:  When the Ambassador called on the 
Minister of Agriculture and Maritime Fisheries 
Akhannouch on January 14, they focused on 
agricultural trade, the recent approval of changes 
to the chocolate standard, the MCA and Maroc Vert's 
(Green Morocco's) progress, and water resource 
management.  The multi-year joint USG/Mars effort to 
secure a change in the chocolate standard opens the 
way for Mars to significantly expand its production, 
product line and sales in Morocco.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  Minister of Agriculture and Maritime Fisheries 
Aziz Akhannouch warmly welcomed the Ambassador, 
USAID/Morocco Director, Agricultural Attache and 
Acting MCC Country Director on January 14.  The 
atmosphere was very amicable.  A large team 
representing the ministry's main sections also 
attended.  The Ambassador asked the Minister about 
his assessment of the U.S.-Morocco Free Trade 
Agreement's (FTA's) progress.  The Minister 
responded with an overall positive assessment, 
citing some progress on the wheat tariff-rate quotas 
(TRQs) and the publication of final rule for the 
longstanding issue of exporting tomatoes from the 
Souss-Massa-Draa region.  The Minister, however, 
voiced some concerns about limited Moroccan exports 
to the U.S. markets, especially of fruits, 
vegetables and olive products.  He said more work 
needed to be done for Morocco to realize the full 
benefits from the FTA. 
 
¶3.  The Ambassador told the Minister that the Mars 
Company was very appreciative of his efforts in 
finalizing the chocolate standard issue.  The 
Minster said he was delighted to be able to deliver 
on his promise to Ambassador Riley and DCM to get 
this issue resolved.  The Ambassador said he would 
inform Ambassador Riley that the promise had been 
fulfilled. 
 
¶4.  Turning to the Millennium Challenge Account 
(MCA) Compact, the Ambassador asked Minister 
Akhannouch how well the implementation of the MCA- 
funded projects in the fishing and agriculture 
sectors was going.  The Minister responded that both 
projects were innovative and integral to Morocco's 
strategies in these sectors.  The MCA fruit tree 
productivity project was, in fact, the cornerstone 
of Morocco's "Green Plan" in the agricultural 
sector, he said.  Implementation of the projects was 
slowed by procedures and studies required by the 
MCC, in addition to difficulties encountered on the 
ground.  The Minister said he would be happy to 
discuss this in more detail during a future meeting. 
Despite challenges, the Minister was optimistic 
about the progress made already.  He added that the 
Ministry has made additional efforts to complement 
the work in the field. 
 
¶5.  Finally, the Minister praised USAID for 50 years 
of support.  He noted particularly the manual of 
procedures produced by USAID to facilitate the 
ministry's restructuring to better implement the 
"Green Plan."  The Minister described the need to 
introduce modern farming methods to Moroccan 
smallholders.  He emphasized his desire for U.S. 
firms to invest in the equipment needed by small 
farmers and said that U.S. firms can now lease land 
in Morocco more easily.  He would also like to see 
expatriate firms "aggregate" the production of small 
farmers to facilitate their transactions with large 
companies.  In response to a question from the 
Ambassador on the plan's ambitious goals, the 
Minister emphasized the need for Morocco to build 
sufficient infrastructure to manage better its water 
resources.  He noted the large amount of water lost 
to poor infrastructure and land and water management 
-- a USAID focus for 2010 through 2014.
