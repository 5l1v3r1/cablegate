REF: OTTAWA 158; OTTAWA 86 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  During a two day visit to Haiti, Canadian Prime 
Minister Harper pledged C$12 million (US$11.4 million) to construct 
temporary buildings as a base for key Haitian government 
departments and underscored that Haiti would remain a long-term 
Canadian aid priority despite future budgetary restraint. 
Individual Canadians have already donated over C$145 million 
($138.3 million) for earthquake relief, of which at least C$124 
million ($118.3 million) will be eligible for matching federal 
funds.  The trip is the first by a G20 leader since the earthquake 
and Harper's second to the country since becoming prime minister in 
¶2006.  The visit also highlights his personal role in directing the 
Canadian government's proactive response to the Haiti disaster 
(reftels), not incidentally reinforcing his already high poll 
numbers for competence and leadership among political leaders. 
End summary. 
 
CANADIAN ASSISTANCE FOR THE LONG AS WELL AS SHORT TERM 
 
¶2.  (U)  Prime Minister Stephen Harper arrived in Port-au-Prince on 
the afternoon of February 15 to get a first-hand look at earthquake 
damage and to assess the contribution of Canadian Forces (CF) 
personnel to disaster relief.  In the capital, he met with Haitian 
President Rene Preval and Prime Minister Max Bellerive.  In 
response to a formal request from Bellerive, PM Harper pledged C$12 
million to erect tents and construct hard-shell temporary buildings 
to provide a base for key Haitian government departments for at 
least one year.  Construction will begin when the Haitian 
government confirms a location.  PM Harper called the buildings "an 
important step toward recovery and reconstruction."   The Boeing 
C-17 cargo plane on which the PM traveled also carried relief 
supplies, including water filters, medical supplies, and equipment. 
 
¶3.  (U)  The C$12 million commitment will apparently come from a 
C$555 million five year disbursement (2006-2011) that Canada had 
previously earmarked for Haitian development and reconstruction. 
In addition, PM Harper pledged that "Canada will continue to 
support the Haitian government as it moves forward with its 
reconstruction and development agenda."  He underscored that 
Canada's commitment will remain firm "even with the tighter fiscal 
situation we have in the years to come" and that "Haiti will be a 
priority."  He added that "we don't intend to leave this time until 
the job is done." 
 
¶4.  (U)  On February 16, PM Harper travelled by helicopter to 
Jacmel (the birthplace of Canadian Governor General Michaelle Jean) 
to inspect CF facilities, including a water purification project. 
He continued to Leogane -- a major hub of Canadian relief activity 
-- where he visited a CF field hospital.  The trip to Haiti was the 
first by a G20 leader since the earthquake and Harper's second as 
Canadian prime minister.  He previously visited Haiti in August 
2007 as part of a Latin American tour. 
 
C$145 MILLION IN INDIVIDUAL DONATIONS 
 
¶5.  (U)  The Canadian government has pledged C$85 million ($81.1 
million) in emergency aid to Haiti and will match eligible 
charitable donations of individual Canadians for earthquake relief 
and reconstruction between January 12 and February 12.  As of 
February 11, Canadians had contributed C$145 million to 14 
charities reporting donations to the Canadian International 
Development Agency (CIDA), of which at least C$124 million should 
be eligible for federal matching funds under the Haiti Earthquake 
Relief Fund.  The final figure is likely to be higher (probably 
around C$130 million), as charities have until February 26 to 
forward all donations made by the February 12 deadline to CIDA.  To 
be eligible for matching funds, donations had to be: 
 
-- made between January 12 and February 12, 2010; 
 
-- monetary (up to C$100,000) ($95,400); 
 
-- from an individual Canadian (or from a fundraising event raising 
money from individuals); and, 
 
-- to a registered charity receiving donations for Haiti earthquake 
relief. 
 
Donations from corporations, provincial and local governments, 
businesses, partnerships, schools, incorporated or non-incorporated 
entities, and unions are not eligible for matching funds. 
 
CONSULAR ASSISTANCE 
 
¶6.  (U) According to the Department of Foreign Affairs and 
 
OTTAWA 00000172  002 OF 002 
 
 
International Trade (DFAIT), as of February 15 at 16:00 EST: 
 
-- 1,921 Canadians in Haiti had been located; 
 
-- 31confirmed Canadian deaths; 
 
-- 55 Canadians remain unaccounted for; and, 
 
-- 4,328 people evacuated on 46 flights. 
 
As of February 12, Canada's Joint Task Force Haiti was fully 
deployed with 2,046 soldiers, sailors, and air force personnel. 
 
PM DEMONSTRATES LEADERSHIP, COMPETENCE 
 
¶7.  (U) As PM Harper has now entered his fifth year as Prime 
Minister, a new Nanos poll confirmed his comfortable lead over 
other federal party leaders in leadership qualities, despite a 
slide in December and January in his personal approval rating and 
in overall support for the Conservative Party.  PM Harper remained 
respondents' clear choice as best prime minister (32% versus 16% 
for Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff) and scored well ahead of the 
other leaders on trust, competence, and vision.  His leadership 
index ranking of 85.4 was more than twice that of Ignatieff (at 
40.3), and alsol ahead of New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Jack 
Layton (at 52.2).  Ignatieff scored third behind Harper and Layton 
on trust, competence, and vision.  A February 4 Nanos poll had 
nonetheless suggested support nationally among committed voters 
remained tied at the Conservatives' 35.6%, the Liberals' 33.9%, and 
the NDP's 16.4%. 
 
 
 
¶8.  (U)  Minimize concerned.
