¶1.  Ambassador met UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova February 19 
to review issues stemming from the Haiti earthquake.  Bokova began 
by discussing her plans to visit Haiti March 9-10.  She said she 
planned to visit cultural sites on March 9 (accompanied by the 
Canadian Governor), spend the night hosted by President Preval, and 
view educational institutions on March 10.  The Director-General 
said she was very sorry to learn that Education Secretary Duncan's 
schedule would not permit him to accompany her on the second day of 
her visit.  She said he was still welcome if he changed his mind, 
and that she hoped he would be able to accompany her on a later 
visit. 
 
¶2.  Ambassador asked Bokova whether she was confident that MINUSTAH 
is doing enough to protect cultural property in Haiti.  Bokova 
replied that UNSYG Ban Ki Moon had assured her that MINUSTAH is 
trying to do so, and recalled that the Haitian Culture Minister who 
visited UNESCO on February 15-16 had assured her that this is being 
done.  Reportedly, the Haitian police and private security are 
involved, although the Culture Minister had admitted that Haitian 
police capabilities are limited. 
 
¶3.  Ambassador reported that he had heard from several sources that 
little is really being done.  The Haitian speakers at UNESCO's 
February 16 emergency meeting on Haitian cultural property (Ref B) 
had said private security personnel were checking cultural sites 
"every one to two hours."  This didn't sound like much.  Bokova 
agreed that it did not.  She said she had written UNSYG Ban Ki Moon 
yesterday and had again requested cultural property be protected. 
Ambassador in turn suggested that she call the UNSYG to reinforce 
the point.  Bokova then had her staff bring to her her letter to 
Ban.  She re-read it, considered a moment, and said I think you're 
right I need to be stronger.  I'll call Ban as soon as I can. 
 
¶4.  Comment:  The extent to which cultural property in Haiti is 
being protected is unclear in Paris.  We have not been reassured, 
however, by UNESCO's tendency to rely on formal written 
communication with UN Headquarters in New York and UN Offices in 
Port-au-Prince.  In the middle of a chaotic and highly stressful 
situation, we are not certain that the Director-General's polite 
letters will receive the attention they deserve.  It seems to us 
good that the Director-General plans to reach out by telephone to 
reinforce the point. 
 
¶5.  Port-au-Prince Minimize considered.
