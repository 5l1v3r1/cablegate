OVERVIEW 
-------- 
 
¶1.  AT INDEPENDENCE IN 1980, THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE INHERITED A 
LANDMINE PROBLEM ALONG SOME OF ITS BORDERS, WHERE RHODESIAN 
SECURITY SERVICES HAD LAID MINES TO HINDER OPERATIONS BY REBEL 
GROUPS BASED IN MOZAMBIQUE AND ZAMBIA.  ALTHOUGH MINE CLEARANCE 
BEGAN IN 1982 IN AFFECTED AREAS, THE GOVERNMENT DID NOT BEGIN TO 
MAKE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS UNTIL 1998, WHEN THE NATIONAL DEMINING 
OFFICE (NDO) WAS FORMED TO COORDINATE NATIONAL DEMINING EFFORTS. 
THE UNITED STATES PROVIDED SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL, TECHNICAL, AND 
MATERIAL ASSISTANCE TO THE NDO AND TO A NATIONAL MINE CLEARANCE 
SQUADRON ESTABLISHED WITHIN THE ZIMBABWE DEFENSE FORCES. 
 
SCOPE OF PROBLEM 
---------------- 
 
¶2.  ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL DEMINING OFFICE, AN ESTIMATED 2.5 
MILLION MINES WERE IN THE GROUND AT INDEPENDENCE.  700,000 MINES 
HAVE NOW BEEN REMOVED, LEAVING 1.8 MILLION STILL TO BE CLEARED. 
 
¶3.  AT INDEPENDENCE, 656 SQUARE KILOMETERS WERE AFFECTED BY MINES 
AT INDEPENDENCE.  OF THOSE, 237 SQUARE KILOMETERS HAVE NOW BEEN 
CLEARED. 
 
¶4.  THERE ARE VERY FEW PEOPLE KILLED OR INJURED BY LANDMINES IN 
ZIMBABWE.  IN 2000, HOWEVER, TWO PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND TWO INJURED 
IN TWO SEPARATE INCIDENTS INVOLVING LAND MINES.  IN THE FIRST CASE, 
THREE CHILDREN WERE PLAYING IN THE EASTERN HIGHLANDS NEAR A MINE

FIELD WHICH WAS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING CLEARED.  ONE OF THE 
CHILDREN FOUND AND PICKED UP A MINE; IT DETONATED, KILLING TWO OF 
THEM AND SERIOUSLY INJURING THE OTHER.  IN THE SECOND INCIDENT, A 
MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL MINE CLEARANCE SQUADRON LOST ONE OF HIS LEGS 
BELOW THE KNEE AFTER HE SLIPPED OFF A ROCK AND LANDED ON A MINE.
