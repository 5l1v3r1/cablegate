VATICAN DOCUMENT PRESENTS WCAR STRATEGY 
--------------------------------------- 
¶2.   THE VATICAN HAS WARNED THAT GLOBALIZATION AND 
TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES THREATEN TO CREATE NEW FORMS OF 
RACISM AGAINST SOCIETY'S WEAKEST MEMBERS, INCLUDING 
IMMIGRANTS, THE POOR AND THE UNBORN. THE COMMENTS CAME IN A 
NEW EDITION OF "THE CHURCH AND RACISM," ISSUED BY THE 
PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND PEACE. FIRST PUBLISHED IN 
1988 AND REVISED AHEAD OF THE WCAR IN DURBAN, SOUTH AFRICA, 
THE DOCUMENT INCLUDES THE ORIGINAL TEXT PLUS A NEW 15-PAGE 
INTRODUCTION. THE NEW TEXT SIGNALED THE VATICAN'S 
DETERMINATION TO INCLUDE MIGRATION, POVERTY AND PRO-LIFE 
ISSUES IN ITS GAME-PLAN AT THE DURBAN CONFERENCE. IT ALSO 
CALLS FOR A MAJOR EDUCATION PROGRAM AGAINST RACISM AND 
INTOLERANCE AND GIVES QUALIFIED SUPPORT FOR AFFIRMATIVE 
ACTION PROGRAMS. THE VATICAN LINKS DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES 
TO ACCELERATING GLOBALIZATION WHICH HAS BROUGHT PROSPERITY 
TO SOME BUT CREATED CULTURAL DISINTEGRATION FOR OTHERS. 
ACCORDING TO THE VATICAN, THE RESULTING LACK OF IDENTITY 
LEADS TO A REJECTION OR FEAR OF FOREIGNERS.

¶3.   THE VATICAN DOCUMENT INDIRECTLY TOUCHED ON FINANCIAL 
COMPENSATION FOR DESCENDANTS OF SLAVES. IT SAID THAT FROM A 
LEGAL POINT OF VIEW ALL PERSONS HAVE THE RIGHT TO EQUITABLE 
REPARATION IF THEY HAVE PERSONALLY OR DIRECTLY SUFFERED 
MATERIAL OR MORAL INJURY, AND THAT IDEALLY REPARATION SHOULD 
ERASE ALL THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE INJUSTICE. WHEN THAT IS 
NOT POSSIBLE, SOME FORM OF EQUIVALENT COMPENSATION SHOULD BE 
MADE, BUT THE DOCUMENT ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THIS IS OFTEN 
DIFFICULT TO CALCULATE. THE DOCUMENT SAID THE PRINCIPLE OF 
REPARATION ALSO HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR RELATIONS BETWEEN 
NATIONS, FOR EXAMPLE, "THE OBLIGATION OF GIVING SUBSTANTIAL 
HELP TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES."

VATICAN WCAR DELEGATE: "NO ONE EQUATES ZIONISM WITH RACISM" 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
¶4.   THE VATICAN'S HEAD OF DELEGATION AT THE WCAR IN DURBAN, 
SOUTH AFRICA, ARCHBISHOP DIARMUID MARTIN, SAID AUGUST 28 
THAT NO ONE EQUATES ZIONISM WITH RACISM ANYMORE, IMPLYING 
THE NOTION WAS AN ANACHRONISM. (NOTE: MARTIN IS THE 
VATICAN'S PERMANENT OBSERVER TO THE U.N. AGENCIES IN GENEVA. 
END NOTE). IN AN INTERVIEW WITH VATICAN NEWS AGENCY "FIDES," 
THE ARCHBISHOP SAID THE DURBAN CONFERENCE MAY TRY TO ADDRESS 
THE QUESTION OF PALESTINIAN SUFFERING IN OTHER WAYS. THE 
SECRETARY (NUMBER 2) AT THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE 
 
SIPDIS 
AND PEACE, BISHOP GIAMPAOLO CREPALDI SAID AUGUST 30 THAT 
POLEMICAL EXCHANGES SURROUNDING THE U.N. CONFERENCE SHOULD 
NOT DISTRACT ATTENTION FROM THE FUNDAMENTAL NEED FOR BETTER 
EDUCATION ON DIVERSITY. (REFTEL)

CARDINAL KASPER LAMENTS END OF CATHOLIC-JEWISH COMMISSION 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
¶5.   THE VATICAN'S TOP ECUMENICAL OFFICIAL, CARDINAL WALTER 
KASPER, HAS LAMENTED THE BREAKUP OF A CATHOLIC-JEWISH 
HISTORICAL COMMISSION STUDYING THE VATICAN'S PUBLISHED WORLD 
WAR II DOCUMENTS AND BLAMED IT PARTLY OF JEWISH MEMBERS' 
"LEAKS AND POLEMICAL WRITINGS." KASPER, PRESIDENT OF THE 
VATICAN'S COMMISSION FOR RELIGIOUS RELATIONS WITH JUDAISM, 
SAID HE WOULD WORK TO RE-LAUNCH THE JOINT RESEARCH "ON NEW 
FOUNDATIONS." HE SAID SUCH HISTORICAL RESEARCH DEPENDED ON 
"CORRECTNESS," RESPECT AND RECIPROCAL TRUST AMONG THE 
PROJECT'S SCHOLARS. KASPER OPINED THAT THIS PRECONDITION HAD 
BEEN COMPLETELY LOST BECAUSE OF THE "POLEMICS THAT AROSE 
AFTER THE SUSPENSION OF THE RESEARCH WORK AND THE OFFENSIVE 
SUSPICIONS THAT ACCOMPANIED THE SUSPENSION." THE CARDINAL 
REAFFIRMED THE VATICAN'S POSITION THAT ITS ARCHIVES RELATING 
TO THE WORLD WAR II PERIOD WOULD BE OPEN TO SCHOLARS WHEN 
THEY HAD BEEN CATALOGUED AND CLASSIFIED. HE ALSO ADMITTED 
THAT REQUESTS FOR ACCESS BY JEWISH SCHOLARS ON THE DEFUNCT 
COMMISSION WERE "UNDERSTANDABLE AND LEGITIMATE," AND THAT 
HISTORICAL INVESTIGATION WAS NECESSARY IN PROMOTING JEWISH-

¶6.   POPE JOHN PAUL II HAS NOMINATED FIVE AMERICAN PRELATES 
TO PARTICIPATE IN A SPECIAL MONTH-LONG VATICAN MEETING TO 
EXAMINE THE ROLE OF BISHOPS. THEY ARE CARDINAL EDWARD EGAN 
OF NEW YORK, CARDINAL EDMUND SZOKA, GOVERNOR OF VATICAN 
CITY, ARCHBISHOP JUSTIN REGALI OF ST. LOUIS, UKRAINIAN RITE 
ARCHBISHOP STEFAN SOROKA OF PHILADELPHIA, AND AUXILIARY 
BISHOP ROBERT MAGINNIS OF PHILADELPHIA. THE PAPAL NOMINEES 
WILL JOIN BISHOPS ELECTED DIRECTLY BY THEIR RESPECTIVE LOCAL 
"CONFERENCES" TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MEETING. THE PAPAL 
NOMINEES ARE PICKED FOR THEIR PARTICULAR THEOLOGICAL 
EXPERTISE AND FOR THEIR PROVEN LOYALTY TO THE HOLY SEE. IN 
ADDITION TO INTERNAL CHURCH MATTERS, THE BISHOPS MEETING 
WILL ALSO ADDRESS POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ISSUES SUCH AS 
GLOBALIZATION, ECOLOGY, MIGRATION, LABOR RIGHTS AND THE 
EXPLOITATION OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN. THE OUTCOME OF THESE 
INTERNATIONAL MEETINGS OF BISHOPS HAS A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF VATICAN FOREIGN POLICY. (SEPTEL TO FOLLOW).

¶7.   ZAMBIAN ARCHBISHOP EMMANUEL MILINGO HAS FINALLY MET 
WITH THE KOREAN WOMEN HE ATTEMPTED TO MARRY AND HAS CALLED 
THE WHOLE THING OFF. PAPAL SPOKESMAN JOAQUIN NAVARRO-VALLS 
ACCOMPANIED MILINGO TO THE SECRET RENDEZVOUS SITE ON AUGUST 
29 AND LATER RELEASED THE CONTENTS OF A LETTER THE 
RECALCITRANT ARCHBISHOP HAD GIVEN TO MARIA SUNG EXPLAINING 
THAT HIS COMMITMENT TO THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND TO PRIESTLY

PAGE 03        VATICA  04605  02 OF 02  041023Z 
CELIBACY DID NOT PERMIT HIM TO MARRY. APPARENTLY SUNG HAS 
ACCEPTED MILINGO'S POSITION AND ENDED HER TWO-WEEK HUNGER 
STRIKE. (COMMENT: WHILE MUCH OF THE MILINGO-SUNG STORY WAS 
THE RESULT OF JOURNALISTIC FANTASY COMBINED WITH A SUMMER 
DEARTH OF NEWS, THE VATICAN WAS APPARENTLY CONCERNED ABOUT A 
POSSIBLE SCHISM CRISIS WITH MILINGO LEAVING THE FOLD TO 
FOUND A CHURCH AIMED AT ATTRACTING ADHERENTS IN AFRICA, LED 
BY BISHOPS AND PRIESTS VALIDITY ORDAINED BY MILINGO, AND 
FUNDED BY THE REVEREND SUN MYUNG MOON. THE VATICAN REGARDS 
MOON AND HIS FOLLOWERS AS ANOTHER RELIGION TOTALLY DIVORCED 
FROM CHRISTIANITY, AND NOT AS A SECT. A SENIOR OFFICIAL SAID 
THE VATICAN HAS NO DESIRE TO ENTER INTO DIALOGUE WITH THE 
GROUP "BECAUSE THERE ARE TOO MANY AMBIGUITIES." END 
COMMENT). NICHOLSON
