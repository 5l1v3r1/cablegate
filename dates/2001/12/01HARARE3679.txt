¶1.   THE GOVERNMENT-OWNED WEEKLY "THE SUNDAY NEWS" 
   DEDICATED ITS DECEMBER 9 EDITORIAL TO CONDEMNING 
   THE UNITED STATES FOR PASSING THE ZIMBABWE 
   DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT OF 2001.  UNDER 
   HEADLINE "LET'S PUT PROPHETS OF DOOM TO SHAME," THE 
   PAPER COMMENTS: 
 
¶2.   "THE IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS AGAINST ZIMBABWE IS A 
   RACIST ATTEMPT BY THE U.S. AND ITS BRITISH COUSINS 
   TO DRAG US BACK TO COLONIAL RULE.  IT IS ALSO AN 
   ACT OF AGGRESSION.  THROUGHOUT HISTORY, POWERFUL 
   NATIONS HAVE IMPOSED SANCTIONS AND EMBARGOES ON 
   WEAKER NATIONS AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO WAR OR AS A 
   PRELUDE TO WAR.  THE PEOPLE OF ZIMBABWE SHOULD NOW 
   SEE THE OPPOSITION MDC (MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC 
   CHANGE) FOR WHAT IT IS.  INSTEAD OF SEEKING FOREIGN 
   PARTNERS IN DEVELOPMENT, MDC LEADERS HAVE COBBLED 
   TOGETHER A CONCERTED CAMPAIGN TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY A 
   PARIAH STATE. . .  THE ANTI-PEOPLE SANCTIONS WILL 
   WORSEN UNEMPLOYMENT, CREATE COMMODITY SHORTAGES AND 
   MAKE LIFE UNBEARABLE.  NO DOUBT PATRIOTIC 
   ZIMBABWEANS WILL FIND IT DISGUSTING THAT A PARTY 
   WHICH CYNICALLY CALLS ITSELF A GOVERNMENT-IN- 
   WAITING IS ACTUALLY URGING THE WEST TO DECLARE WAR 
   ON THE COUNTRY. . . ."
