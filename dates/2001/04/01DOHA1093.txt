CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR ELIZABETH MCKUNE FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D)

¶1. (S) AMBASSADOR PRESENTED REF A DEMARCHE TO FOREIGN MINISTER HAMAD BIN JASIM AL THANI (HBJ) ON APRIL 7. SHORTLY AFTER AMBASSADOR BEGAN TALKING POINTS, HBJ INTERRUPTED AND SAID "WE DONT WANT A TRIAL HERE OF BIN LADEN. THERE WILL BE NO TRIAL HERE OR ANYWHERE ELSE, UNLESS ALL COUNTRIES ARE IN AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE U.S." HE ADDED THAT WERE THE TALIBAN TO APPROACH THE GOQ WITH SUCH A PROPOSAL, THE GOQ WOULD AGREE TO STUDY IT BUT PROMISE NOTHING.

¶2. (C) HBJ CONFIRMED THAT A TALIBAN DELEGATION WAS ARRIVING IN QATAR TODAY (APRIL 7). THE AMBASSADOR REMINDED HIM THAT THE US IS THE SINGLE LARGEST CONTRIBUTOR OF HUMANITARIAN AID TO AFGHANISTAN. SHE ASKED WHETHER MINISTER OF STATE AL MAHMOUD HAD BRIEFED HIM ON HER PREVIOUS DEMARCHES ON THE TALIBAN (REFS B AND D). HBJ RESPONDED, "YES."

¶3. (C) COMMENT: HBJ GRANTED THE MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR WITHIN AN HOUR OF THE REQUEST. HE WAS CLEARLY PLEASED THAT A/S WALKER HAD CALLED. WE WILL GET A READ OUT ON THE TALIBANS VISIT WHEN IT IS CONCLUDED.
