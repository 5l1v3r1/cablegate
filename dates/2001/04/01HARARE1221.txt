MOST SEVERELY AFFECTED DISTRICTS OF GURUVE AND MUZARABANI 
ALONG THE ZAMBEZI RIVER IN THE NORTH OF THE ZIMBABWE, AN 
ESTIMATED 21,400 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN AFFECTED TO VARYING DEGREES 
BY RECENT FLOODING. HEAVY RAINS, FLASH FLOODING AND WATER- 
LOGGING HAVE ALSO AFFECTED SOME CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN PARTS OF 
THE COUNTRY.  THE HEAVY RAINFALL, WHICH BEGAN IN LATE 
FEBRUARY, HAS EASED IN THE PAST TWO WEEKS, SIGNALING THE 
BEGINNING OF THE END OF THIS YEAR'S RAINS.  THE GOVERNMENT OF 
ZIMBABWE, THE PRIVATE SECTOR, AND DONOR AGENCIES, INCLUDING 
SAVE THE CHILDREN (UK), WORLD VISION, THE ZIMBABWE RED CROSS 
SOCIETY AND OTHER NGOS, CONTINUE TO PROVIDE RELIEF ASSISTANCE 
TO THE AFFECTED COMMUNITIES.  ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE IS NEEDED 
TO REPAIR DAMAGED INFRASTRUCTURE, BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE. 
¶2.  GOVERNMENT-PROVIDED MATERIAL AND CONSUMABLES ASSISTANCE, 
SUCH AS CLOTHING, FUEL, FOODSTUFFS, HOUSEHOLD ITEMS AND 
TRANSPORT, WAS SUPPLIED AND MANAGED THROUGH THE OFFICES OF THE 
CIVIL PROTECTION DEPARTMENT (CPD) UNITS IN THE AFFECTED 
DISTRICTS.  THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL SHORTCOMINGS IN DELIVERING 
GOVERNMENT RELIEF ASSISTANCE.  THESE INCLUDE INSUFFICIENT 
RESOURCES TO RESPOND ADEQUATELY TO THE EMERGENCY, INACCURATE

ASSESSMENTS BECAUSE ROADS AND BRIDGES WERE DESTROYED, 
COMMUNICATION PROBLEMS AND THE TRANSPARENCY AND EQUITY OF THE 
RELIEF DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS UTILIZED.  HOWEVER, THE GOZ, 
THROUGH THE CPD AND IN COLLABORATION WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR 
MUNICIPAL ORGANIZATIONS, DID MANAGE TO SEND OUT EMERGENCY 
RELIEF ALERTS AND CONDITION REPORTS, AND TOOK CHARGE OF THE 
OVERALL CO-ORDINATION OF THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND THE RELIEF 
DISTRIBUTION EXERCISE.

ADDITIONAL MEDICINES TO CONTROL CHOLERA AND DYSENTERY. 
IMMEDIATE REQUIREMENTS ARE SUPPLEMENTARY FOODSTUFFS
