     OF INFORMATION AND PROTECTION OF PRIVACY BILL. THE 
     CONTROVERSIAL BILL COULD BECOME LAW BEFORE THE END OF THE 
     YEAR. UNDER HEADLINE "MOYO'S FUTILE WAR," THE PAPER 
     COMMENTS: 
 
  ¶2.   "PERHAPS RAMSEY CLARK, A FORMER AMERICAN 
     ATTORNEY-GENERAL, CAPTURED THE ESSENCE OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S 
     FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS MORE THAN MOST OF TODAY'S SCHOLARS WHEN, 
     IN 1977, HE STATED: 'A RIGHT IS NOT WHAT SOMEONE GIVES YOU; 
     IT IS WHAT NO ONE CAN TAKE FROM YOU-' AS ZIMBABWE FACES UP 
     TO ITS MOST DEFINING MOMENT POLITICALLY, CLARK'S WORDS MUST 
     SURELY TROUBLE ALL GOOD MEN AND WOMEN IN THE LAND AS A 
     DESPERATE GOVERNMENT DECLARES A TOTAL ONSLAUGHT ON THEIR 
     BASIC RIGHTS JUST TO CLING TO POWER. JONATHAN MOYO, ONCE THE 
     GOVERNMENT'S CHIEF FOE AND NOW ITS MOST LOYAL PROPAGANDIST, 
     IS LEADING WHAT HAS BECOME THE MOST  VICIOUS CAMPAIGN 
     EVER TO SILENCE ALL DIVERGENT VOICES, CRUCIALLY 
     ZIMBABWE'S INDEPENDENT MEDIA, AHEAD OF A LANDMARK 
     PRESIDENTIAL BALLOT THAT THREATENS TO BURY HIM AND HIS AGING 
     (SIC) MASTERS. . MOYO HAS COME TO SYMBOLIZE THROUGH HIS 
     HIGH-HANDEDNESS AND IRRESPONSIBLE UTTERANCES ALL THAT IS 
     WRONG AND BAD WITH A GOVERNMENT THAT HAS UTTERLY FAILED ITS 
     CITIZENS . . . NOW, AFTER WHIPPING UP A FRENZY OF EMOTIONS 
     AGAINST ALL WHO WISH AND WANT TO SEE ZIMBABWE PROSPER AND 
     BECOME PART OF THE CIVILIZED WORLD, HE IS RACING TO ENACT A 
     LAW AGAINST THE MEDIA WHICH HE KNOWS RUNS COUNTER TO THE 
     NATION'S BASIC FREEDOMS . . . LET IT BE KNOWN THAT AN 
     INDIVIDUAL'S UNFETTERED RIGHT TO RECEIVE AND IMPART 
     INFORMATION, WHICH HE IS SEEKING TO CURTAIL, IS A CARDINAL 
     PLANK OF ANY DEMOCRACY AND CIVILIZED GOVERNANCE AND THAT 
     ZIMBABWEANS DESERVE NO LESS AND NO MORE. 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

 ¶3. "MOYO'S ATTEMPT TO GAG THE MEDIA AND TO PREVENT IT FROM 
     DOING ITS NATIONAL DUTY OF HIGHLIGHTING ZIMBABWE'S GLARING 
     INJUSTICES, LAWLESSNESS AND VIOLENCE, CORRUPTION AND OTHER 
     ILLS WILL FAIL SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO BASIS IN LAW. BUT 
     MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE ENTRENCHED RIGHTS (THAT) HE WANTS TO 
     TRAMPLE UPON ARE GOD-GIVEN AND WILL ALWAYS REMAIN SO. THE 
     UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION . . . WILL BE FATALLY FLAWED 
     IF THE NEW ANTI-DEMOCRACY LEGISLATION IS APPROVED . . . AS 
     AMERICA'S INCOMING AMBASSADOR TO ZIMBABWE, JOSEPH SULLIVAN, 
     BLUNTLY TOLD THE GOVERNMENT LAST WEEK: I . . . WE CANNOT 
     HAVE GOOD RELATIONS (WITH ZIMBABWE) UNTIL THE GOVERNMENT 
     ACTS TO END VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION AND RESTORES THE RULE 
     OF LAW AND RESPECTS THE FREEDOM TO OPERATE OF POLITICAL 
     PARTIES AND DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING AN 
     INDEPENDENT MEDIA, CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS AND THE 
     JUDICIARY . . .THERE YOU ARE MOYO. ALL ZIMBABWEANS AND THEIR 
     TRUE FRIENDS AROUND THE GLOBE WANT THE SIMPLE BUT CRUCIAL 
     THINGS TO BE DONE BUT YOUR GOVERNMENT COULD CARE LESS."
