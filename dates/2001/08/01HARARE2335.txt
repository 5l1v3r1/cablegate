    SECRETARY FOR INFORMATION AND PUBLICITY, INFORMATION 
    MINISTER JONATHAN MOYO HAS CRITICIZED THE UNITED STATES FOR 
    SPONSORING THE ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY 
    BILL 2001.  THE LEAD ARTICLE PUBLISHED IN THE AUGUST 5 
    EDITION OF THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED WEEKLY 'THE SUNDAY 
    MAIL,' QUOTES MINISTER MOYO AS HAVING CHARACTERIZED THE 
    BILL AS "A RACIST PIECE OF LEGISLATION."  UNDER HEADLINE 
    "STATE SLAMS U. S.: AMERICA NOT THE POLICEMAN OF THE WORLD: 
    MOYO," THE PAPER REPORTS: 
 
¶2.   "AMERICA IS NOT THE POLICEMAN OF THE WORLD AND SHOULD 
    LEAVE ZIMBABWE TO DETERMINE ITS DESTINY, THE ZANU PF 
    DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR INFORMATION AND PUBLICITY, 
    PROFESSOR JONATHAN MOYO, SAID YESTERDAY (AUGUST 14). 
    HE WAS COMMENTING ON THE PASSING OF THE ZIMBABWE 
    DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY BILL THAT SEEKS TO 
    IMPOSE SANCTIONS AGAINST ZIMBABWE BY THE U. S. SENATE 
    LAST FRIDAY. . .'I CAN'T SEE A NORMAL PRESIDENT SIGNING 
    SUCH A RACIST BILL.  THE PASSAGE OF THE BILL SEEMS TO 
    BE A TYPICAL EXAMPLE OF THINGS THAT ARE FULL OF SOUND 
    THAT SIGNIFY NOTHING. . .THE PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND 
    HOW A GOVERNMENT THAT ALLOWS A GENOCIDE IN RWANDA NOW 
    WANTS TO POKE ITS NOSE INTO THE AFFAIRS OF ZIMBABWE. 
    THE PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW A GOVERNMENT THAT IS 
    PLAYING PING PONG WHILE PALESTINIANS ARE BEING GUNNED 
    DOWN BY THE BRUTALITY OF ISRAEL WANTS TO GET INVOLVED 
    IN ZIMBABWEAN MATTERS.  MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE PEOPLE 
    DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW A COUNTRY THAT DOES NOT WANT TO 
    APOLOGIZE FOR SLAVERY IN AFRICA, A COUNTRY THAT DOES 
    NOT WANT TO COMPENSATE AFRICA FOR COLONIALISM, YET 
    ASSISTING ISRAEL TO GET COMPENSATION, CAN POKE ITS NOSE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HARARE  02335  061225Z 
    ON THE AFFAIRS OF ZIMBABWE.  IF THEY DON'T WANT TO 
    APOLOGIZE TO AFRICA FOR SLAVERY AND COLONIALISM, WHY 
    SHOULD WE TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY WHEN THEY TALK OF 
    DEMOCRACY. . .?  THE BILL IS A RACIST BILL BECAUSE IT'S 
    TARGETING AFRICAN PEOPLE WHOSE CRIME IS TO SEEK THE 
    RESTORATION OF THEIR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS.  IT'S NOTHING 
    BUT A RACIST PIECE OF LEGISLATION. . .AMERICA IS 
    BASICALLY A RACIST COUNTRY.  ITS HISTORY IS A HISTORY 
    OF RACISM, SLAVERY, AND COLONIALISM.  OUR FORMER SLAVE 
    MASTERS CAN NEVER BE OUR LIBERATORS.  THEY CAN NEVER 
    STOP THE THIRD CHIMURENGA, AND IF THEY TRY TO DO SO, 
    THEY WILL CAUSE ANOTHER REVOLUTION. . . .,' HE SAID."
