RWANDAN PRIEST "NOT HIDING FROM JUSTICE" 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.   A SPOKESMAN FOR THE ARCHDIOCESE OF FLORENCE CLAIMS A 
RWANDAN PRIEST ACCUSED OF GENOCIDE IS NOT HIDING IN ITALY 
AND HAS NOT RECEIVED FORMAL NOTIFICATION OF CHARGES AGAINST 
HIM. THE SPOKESMAN SAYS FATHER ATHANASE SEROMBA HAS CEASED 
TO OFFICIATE AT PUBLIC LITURGICAL RITES BECAUSE OF 
"ASPHYXIATING" MEDIA ATTENTION. FATHER SEROMBA IS APPARENTLY 
READY TO "EXPLAIN" HIS SITUATION AND RESPOND TO ALL 
ACCUSATIONS AGAINST HIM, "IN THE PROPER FORUM WHEN HE IS 
REQUIRED TO DO SO." THE SPOKESMAN SAID, "THERE IS SUSPICION 
THAT SOME PEOPLE MAY BE INTERESTED IN HARMING THE CHURCH IN 
RWANDA." AFRICA RIGHTS, A LONDON-BASED HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP, 
FIRST REPORTED ACCUSATIONS OF GENOCIDE AGAINST SEROMBA. 
ITALIAN MISSIONARY NEWS AGENCY "MISNA" TOLD REPORTERS THAT 
AFRICA RIGHTS' ACCUSATIONS SHOULD BE DEALT WITH CAUTIOUSLY 
BECAUSE ETHNIC TUTSI RWANDANS WHO ARE CLOSE TO THE CURRENT 
REGIME IN KIGALI" FOUNDED THE ORGANIZATION. (NOTE: MISNA IS 
NOT A VATICAN NEWS AGENCY. END NOTE). MERANTE
