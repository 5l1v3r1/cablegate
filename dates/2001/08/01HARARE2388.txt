LAWLESSNESS ON COMMERCIAL FARMS.  THE EDITORIAL COMES IN THE WAKE 
OF RENEWED CLASHES BETWEEN COMMERCIAL FARMERS AND FARM INVADERS IN 
CHINHOYI THIS WEEK.  UNDER HEADLINE "GOVERNMENT INSINCERE ON 
CURBING FARM VIOLENCE," THE PAPER COMMENTS: 
 
¶2. "THE COMMONWEALTH MINISTERIAL ACTION GROUP (CMAG), WHICH IS DUE TO 
MEET IN ABUJA, NIGERIA, NEXT WEEK TO DISCUSS ZIMBABWE, MIGHT FIND 
IT DIFFICULT TO SAVE THE COUNTRY FROM CENSURE BY THE 50-ODD NATION 
MEMBERS, BECAUSE OF UGLY EVENTS THIS WEEK. . .AN ELDERLY KWEKWE 
FARMER WAS BRUTALLY ATTACKED LAST FRIDAY IN ONE OF THE GRUESOME 
ATTACKS DURING THE PAST YEAR.  HE DIED THIS WEEK ON MONDAY NIGHT. 
THE SECOND INCIDENT RELATES TO THE FIGHTING BETWEEN FARMERS AND 
LAND INVADERS IN THE CHINHOYI AREA. . .WHAT IS QUITE CLEAR IS THAT 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS NO INTENTION OF BRINGING THIS LAWLESSNESS TO AN 
END.  IT IS DISCRIMINATORY, IN THE EXTREME, FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO 
PROTECT INVADERS ONLY, WHILE PROPERTY RIGHTS OF THE FARM OWNERS 
ARE DRAGGED THROUGH THE MUD AND TRAMPLED ON, ESPECIALLY WHERE BOTH 
PARTIES AGREE ON THE NEED FOR LAND REDISTRIBUTION. . . WE SHOULD 
BE VERY AFRAID OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE TRAGIC MURDER OF 76- 
YEAR-OLD RALPH FENWICK COBBERT AND THE FIGHTING IN CHINHOYI. 
THESE CAN ONLY CONVINCE CMAG AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
SENATE, WHICH IS CONSIDERING THE ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY AND (ECONOMIC) 
RECOVERY BILL, THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS ACTED 
NEGLIGENTLY IN ALLOWING THE SITUATION IN THIS COUNTRY TO 
DETERIORATE FURTHER IN THIS DESCENT INTO HELL."
