    CORRESPONDENTS BASED IN ZIMBABWE.  ACCORDING TO AN 
    ARTICLE PUBLISHED IN THE JULY 26 EDITION OF THE 
    GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED DAILY "THE HERALD," THE

¶2.  "THE DEPARTMENT OF INFORMATION AND PUBLICITY YESTERDAY 
    (JULY 25) SUSPENDED THE ACCREDITATION OF BBC 
    CORRESPONDENTS IN ZIMBABWE FOLLOWING A SERIES OF 
    ALLEGED DISTORTIONS OF EVENTS IN THE COUNTRY.  THE 
    MINISTER OF STATE FOR INFORMATION AND PUBLICITY, 
    PROFESSOR JONATHAN MOYO, SAID DISTORTIONS AND 
    MISREPRESENTATIONS WERE UNACCEPTABLE AND WOULD NOT BE 
    ALLOWED TO CONTINUE.  'THE TIME HAS COME FOR THE BBC TO 
    FOLLOW AND UPHOLD IN ZIMBABWE THE SAME PROFESSIONAL AND 
    ETHICAL STANDARDS IT FOLLOWS IN BRITAIN.  THAT IS THE 
    BOTTOM LINE, NOTHING LESS OR MORE,' SAID PROF. MOYO IN 
    A LETTER TO MILTON NKOSI, BBC NEWS BUREAU CHIEF IN 
    JOHANNESBURG. .
