SUBJECT: RESPONSE OF ZIMBABWEAN MUSLIM/ISLAMIC POLITICAL 
LEADERS 
 
REF:  STATE 175484 
 
¶1.  ZIMBABWEAN MUSLIM/ISLAMIC LEADERS HAVE NOT OFFERED 
PUBLIC COMMENTS ON EVENTS IN AFGHANISTAN. 
 
¶2.  MUSLIMS IN ZIMBABWE ARE PRIMARILY WELL EDUCATED AND 
INFORMED MERCHANTS AND PROFESSIONALS, PEOPLE NOT EASILY 
SWAYED BY EMOTIONAL RHETORIC.  THE COMMUNITY'S RELIGIOUS 
LEADERS GENERALLY REFLECT THE SOPHISTICATION OF THEIR 
CONSTITUENTS.  ONE INFLUENTIAL MEMBER OF ZIMBABWE'S SMALL 
ISLAMIC COMMUNITY TOLD PAO THAT MUSLIMS HERE WERE 
"HEARTBROKEN" ABOUT THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS AND DO NOT 
IDENTIFY WITH BIN LADEN OR THE TALIBAN'S RADICALLY 
FUNDAMENTAL INTERPRETATION OF ISLAM.  THE CONTACT SAID THAT 
WHILE ZIMBABWEAN MUSLIMS MAY HAVE DOUBTS ABOUT THE U.S. 
MILITARY ACTIONS AGAINST THE TALIBAN, THEY ARE MORE BROADLY 
REFLECTIVE OF ZIMBABWEAN, RATHER THAN MUSLIM, MISGIVINGS 
ABOUT THE WISDOM OF MILITARY ACTION AGAINST A TARGET AS 
ELUSIVE AS BIN LADEN AND HIS TALIBAN SUPPORTERS.
