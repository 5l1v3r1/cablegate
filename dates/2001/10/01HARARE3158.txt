¶1.   THE OCTOBER 21 EDITION OF THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED 
   WEEKLY "THE SUNDAY MAIL" CARRIED TWO OPINION PIECES 
   FOCUSING ON THE SEPTEMBER 11 TERRORIST ATTACKS IN THE 
   U.S. AND THE U.S.-LED STRIKE AGAINST TERROR IN 
   AFGHANISTAN. 
 
¶2.   UNDER HEADLINE "WHAT GOES ROUND COMES AROUND," THE 
   NEWSPAPER RAN THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE BY SURE MATARAMVURA, 
   A LECTURER IN THE DEPARTMENT OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS AT 
   THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 
   (NUST): 
 
   "THE BOMBING OF THE WTC (WORLD TRADE CENTER) AND THE 
   PENTAGON IN THE U.S. RECENTLY AND REACTION OF BOTH THE 
   U.S. AS A NATION AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAVE 
   LED ME TO CONCLUDE ONE THING; THAT HISTORY REPEATS 
   ITSELF.  BEFORE I JUSTIFY MY REASONS TO SAY THIS, WE 
   NEED TO LOOK AT THE CAUSES AND EFFECTS OF THIS TRAGEDY. 
   I AM ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN COMFORTABLE 
   WITH THE PRESENT SITUATION WHERE ONE COUNTRY, THE U.S., 
   BECOMES THE HEADMASTER, DEPUTY HEADMASTER AND SENIOR 
   MASTER OF THE WORLD BY PRESENTING ITSELF AS THE CHIEF 
   ARCHITECT OF DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS AND PRONOUNCING 
   ON ANY NATION THAT WOULD HAVE FAILED TO CALL IT MASTER. 
   . .THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN OBSERVING THE BEHAVIORS OF 
   SUCCESSIVE U.S. ADMINISTRATIONS FROM THE SECOND WORLD 
   WAR HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE U.S. 
   WAS TO BUILD A U.S. EMPIRE. . .THOSE COUNTRIES WHO DARED 
   BLOCK THIS OBJECTIVE WERE SUBJECTED TO THE U.S. MAIN 
   WEAPON OF TORTURE: ECONOMIC SANCTIONS WHICH ARE 
   SOMETIMES OPENLY ANNOUNCED THROUGH THE U.S. PARLIAMENT, 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HARARE  03158  01 OF 02  230821Z 
   THE U.N. OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH THEIR COMPANIES SCATTERED 
   ALL OVER THE WORLD.  THE OTHER WEAPON WAS/IS TO FUND 
   TERRORISTS TO TOPPLE THOSE UNDESIRED GOVERNMENTS WHO 
   CHALLENGE THE U.S. . .THE KEY ISSUE IS THAT AS A RESULT 
   OF THE BOMBINGS IN WASHINGTON, INNOCENT PEOPLE DIED AND 
   THAT THERE IS A SPONSOR TO THESE TERRORIST ATTACKS. 
   WHETHER IT WAS BIN LADEN OR NOT IS NOT THE ISSUE, THE 
   ISSUE IS THAT THERE IS A MAD MAN SOMEWHERE, JUST LIKE 
   THE SUCCESSIVE U.S. ADMINISTRATIONS, WHO DOES NOT VALUE 
   LIFE AND INSTEAD SPONSORS A GROUP OF PEOPLE TO ACHIEVE 
   HIS OBJECTIVE, OF CREATING AN EMPIRE, BE IT BIN LADEN 
   EMPIRE OR A U.S. EMPIRE. . .TERRORISM DID NOT START WIN 
   BIN LADEN.  ACTUALLY BIN LADEN WAS ONCE A TERRORIST ON 
   THE CIA PAYROLL.  THE ONLY DIFFERENCE NOW IS THAT BIN 
   LADEN HAS TARGETED THE U.S. EMPIRE. . .THE IDEA OF 
   EMPIRE CREATION SHOULD BE ABANDONED ONCE AND FOREVER. 
   IT HAS NEVER SUCCEEDED AND IF IT CONTINUES, WILL BE THE 
   BASIS OF A THIRD WORLD WAR, WHICH WILL OBVIOUSLY TARGET 
   THE EMPERORS. . .ALL FORMS OF TERRORISM SHOULD BE 
   INVESTIGATED AND DEALT WITH BY THE INTERNATIONAL 
   COMMUNITY.  THESE RANGE FROM BIOLOGICAL TERRORISM AND 
   ECONOMIC TERRORISM TO MILITARY-STYLE TERRORISM. . . ." 
 
¶3.   UNDER HEADLINE "INVASION OF AFGHANISTAN WON'T STOP 
   TERRORISM," THE SAME NEWSPAPER PUBLISHED THE FOLLOWING 
   PIECE BY BRIGADIER FELIX MUCHEMWA, A RETIRED ZIMBABWE 
   NATIONAL ARMY OFFICER, A FORMER CABINET MINISTER IN THE 
   ZIMBABWE GOVERNMENT AND A PRACTICING MEDICAL DOCTOR: 
 
   ". . . WHEN AMERICA ADOPTED, IN RESPONSE TO THE 
   SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS, A TOTAL OR GRAND STRATEGY AGAINST 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HARARE  03158  01 OF 02  230821Z 
   AL QUEDA, IT WAS RIGHT.  THAT IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE 
   RESPONSE TO SUCH A CONFLICT, BUT THIS MIGHT STILL FAIL 
   IF THE CAUSE OF WAR BY MOSLEM FUNDAMENTALISTS IS NOT 
   CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD. . .THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS TOTAL GRAND 
   MILITARY STRATEGY AND THE GRAND ALLIANCE IS THE TOTAL 
   ELIMINATION OF THE TALIBAN REGIME AND ITS BEDFELLOWS, 
   THE AL QUEDA, THE CAPTURE OF AFGHANISTAN AND THE 
   RECREATION OF A NEW REGIME FAVORABLE TO WESTERN POWERS. 
   BIN LADEN, DEAD OR ALIVE, MUST BE CAPTURED. . .BUT 
   AMERICA HAS SPELT OUT ITS GOAL IN THIS WAR - 'STOP 
   TERRORISM.'  WILL THE OBJECTIVE OF CAPTURING AFGHANISTAN 
   ACHIEVE THIS GOAL?  THE ANSWER IS NO.  AL QUEDA IS NOW 
   AN INTERNATIONAL WORLD FORCE READY TO HIT ANYWHERE.  IT 
   HAS TOO MUCH MONEY, TOO MANY PROFESSIONALS AND 
   TECHNOCRATS ON ITS PAYROLL TO PRODUCE EVEN A TACTICAL 
   NUCLEAR WEAPON FOR ITS PURPOSE.  ABOVE ALL, THE MOSLEM 
   WORLD'S DEEP FEELINGS ARE ON THEIR SIDE.  THEIR MESSAGE 
   IS SIMPLE - AMERICA IS SUPPORTING CORRUPT SHEIKS, 
   PRINCES AND MILITARY DICTATORS IN THE MOSLEM WORLD, 
   CAUSING MASSIVE SUFFERING OF MOSLEM PEOPLE.  ALL THE OIL 
   DOLLARS FROM THE MIDDLE EAST ARE IN WESTERN-CONTROLLED 
   BANKS ON MONEY LAUNDERING WITH THE GRACE OF AMERICA.

   LAND, NOT DIPLOMATIC PROMISES.  SO THE CAPTURE OF 
   AFGHANISTAN IS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF A MORE SERIOUS WAR 
   AT A DIFFERENT SITE, AND DIFFERENT LEVEL.  THE GOAL FOR 
   PEACE FROM 'TERRORISM' STILL REMAINS ELUSIVE AND MORE 
   SUFFERING LIES AHEAD."
