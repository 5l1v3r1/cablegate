SUBJECT: CASE AGAINST DAILY NEWS EDITOR DISMISSED 
 
¶1.   CHARGES AGAINST THE INDEPENDENT "DAILY NEWS" EDITOR- 
   IN-CHIEF GEOFF NYAROTA AND HIS FORMER BUSINESS PARTNER 
   WILF MBANGA WERE DISMISSED ON NOVEMBER 16 FOR LACK OF 
   EVIDENCE.  THE RULING BY HARARE MAGISTRATE WESTON 
   NYAMWANZA INCLUDES LIFTING OF ALL BAIL CONDITIONS. 
 
¶2.   NYAROTA AND MBANGA WERE ARRESTED ON NOVEMBER 8 ON 
   ALLEGATIONS OF FRAUD OR CONTRAVENTION OF INVESTMENT 
   PROCEDURES.  IN DISMISSING THE CASE, THE MAGISTRATE 
   CRITICIZED THE WAY THE POLICE CONDUCTED THE 
   INVESTIGATIONS IN THE MATTER, SAYING THE POLICE HAD 
   "GONE ON TO ARREST WITHOUT ANY REASONABLE SUSPICION." 
   THE COURT RULED THAT IT WAS IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE 
   TO REMOVE ALL BAIL CONDITIONS FROM NYAROTA AND MBANGA. 
   MAGISTRATE NYAMWANZA DID SAY THAT THE STATE COULD SUMMON 
   THE TWO FOR TRIAL IF IT ASSEMBLED MORE EVIDENCE AND 
   DECIDED TO PROCEED WITH THE CASE.
