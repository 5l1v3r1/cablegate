¶1.   THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED WEEKLY "CHRONICLE" DEDICATED 
   ITS NOVEMBER 6 EDITORIAL TO DENOUNCE THE UNITED STATES 
   AND THE EUROPEAN UNION FOR ALLEGEDLY "GANGING UP AGAINST 
   ZIMBABWE."  UNDER HEADLINE "GANGING UP AGAINST ZIMBABWE 
   WON'T WORK," THE PAPER COMMENTS: 
 
¶2.   "WHAT IS IT THAT ZIMBABWE HAS WHICH NECESSITATES THE 
   PASSING OF A LAW BY A SUPER POWER, ATTRACTS THE 
   ATTENTION OF A GROUPING OF RELATIVELY WELL-OFF EUROPEAN 
   COUNTRIES AND MAKES ITS FORMER COLONIZER WANT TO SPONSOR 
   AN OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTY. . .?  WHEN THE 
   GOVERNMENT, THAT FOR CLOSE TO 15 YEARS WAS SHACKLED BY 
   CONSTITUTIONAL CLAUSES THAT PREVENTED IT FROM RE- 
   DISTRIBUTING LAND, FINALLY GETS DOWN TO BUSINESS, THE 
   WHOLE WORLD NOW THINKS IT IS AN ISSUE WHICH DEMANDS 
   THEIR ACTION.  IF THERE WERE NO WHITES IN ZIMBABWE, 
   WOULD THE U.S., AUSTRALIA AND CANADA DEAL WITH US WITH 
   THE SAME ZEAL AS THEY ARE DISPLAYING NOW?  WHILE BLACKS 
   WERE DISPOSSESSED OF THEIR HERITAGE AND TRUDGED ON UNDER 
   THE YOKE OF COLONIALISM FOR NEARLY A CENTURY, WHERE WERE 
   THE CHAMPIONS OF 'RULE OF LAW' AND 'DEMOCRACY?'  DID WE 
   EVER HEAR OF AN ANTI-RHODESIAN DEMOCRACY BILL. . .? 
   THERE ARE PROBLEMS IN MANY AFRICAN COUNTRIES, BUT JUST 
   BECAUSE OF THE ABSENCE OF WHITES, THE ABC OF THE WORLD - 
   AMERICA, BRITAIN, AND CANADA  - DO NOT LIFT A FINGER. 
   IF A PROBLEM INVOLVES BLACKS AGAINST BLACKS: IT DOES NOT 
   WARRANT THE INTERVENTION OF THE EU, OR A PIECE OF 
   LEGISLATION FROM THE U. S. CONGRESS.  ZIMBABWE IS A 
   SUCCESS STORY IN LAND REVOLUTION SO MUCH THAT THE WEST 
   IS TRYING TO THROW SPANNERS INTO THE WORKS. . . ."
