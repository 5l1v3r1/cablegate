¶2.  (SBU) On January 17, the judge hearing the Federal Tax 
Service (FTS) case against PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) for 
allegedly falsifying audits of former oil giant Yukos has 
granted PWC's request for a delay in the start of proceedings 
as well as the firm's request for arbitration.  The 
three-member arbitration panel will begin hearing the case on 
February 14.  The judge also granted the prosecution's 
request to combine the charges relating to PWC's 2002, 2003, 
and 2004 audits of Yukos into one case.  PWC contacts have 
told us that the prosecution continues to collect evidence of 
supposed misconduct, but they believe much of this 
information of little relevance to the case.
