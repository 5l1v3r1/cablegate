SUBJECT: FOLLOW-UP: NZ PARTICIPATION IN ARF WORKSHOP ON 
UNSCR 1540 IMPLEMENTATION 
 
REF: SECSTATE 3582 
 
(SBU) On January 24, Pol-Econ Counselor discussed reftel ARF 
Workshop invitation with Michael Swain, Deputy Director of 
the Security Policy Division at the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and Trade (MFAT).  Swain said that MFAT officials 
have been aware of the workshop since it was discussed at 
last November's ARF meeting and very much hope to 
participate.   At this point, it appears the GNZ will not be 
able to send a representative out of Wellington, as all 
likely candidates are preparing for the PSI Operational 
Experts Group exercise that New Zealand will host in March. 
Swain has asked the NZ Consulate in Los Angeles to represent 
New Zealand at the ARF workshop, and will advise post when he 
gets an answer.  Swain said he would also write directly to 
EAP/RSP's Kevin Sheives.
