REF: 06 STATE 178303 
 
This is the second part of Taiwan's 2007 Investment Climate 
Statement. The first part has been sent septel. 
 
---------------------------------- 
¶B. Bilateral Investment Agreements 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶39.  Taiwan has concluded bilateral investment guaranty agreements 
with the following 26 countries: Argentina, Belize, Burkina Faso, 
Costa Rica, Dominica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, India, 
Indonesia, Liberia, Malaysia, Macedonia, the Marshall Islands, 
Nicaragua, Nigeria, Panama, Paraguay, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, 
Senegal, Singapore, Swaziland, Thailand, Malawi, and Vietnam.  In 
addition, there is an agreement to guaranty Taiwan's investment in 
Malawi and other agreements to protect U.S. investment in Taiwan 
(see next paragraph).  (An agreement with Latvia signed in 1992 was 
revoked in August 2004.) 
 
¶40.  Under the terms of the 1948 Friendship, Commerce, and 
Navigation Treaty with the United States, U.S. investors are 
generally accorded national treatment and are provided with a number 
of protections, including protection against expropriation.  Taiwan 
and the United States also have an agreement, signed in 1952, 
pertaining to investment guarantees that serve as the basis for the 
U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) program in 
Taiwan.  In September 1994, representatives of the United States and 
Taiwan signed a bilateral Trade and Investment Framework Agreement 
(TIFA) to serve as the basis for consultations on trade and 
investment issues.  Consultations on a bilateral investment 
agreement between the United States and Taiwan began in 1996, and 
the latest round took place in Taipei in 2006. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
¶C. OPIC and Other Investment-Insurance Programs 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶41.  OPIC programs are available to U.S. investors, though U.S. 
investors have never filed an OPIC insurance claim for an investment 
in Taiwan.  Taiwan is not a member of the Multilateral Investment 
Guaranty Agency. 
 
-------- 
¶D. Labor 
-------- 
 
¶42.  As a result of Taiwan's changing industrial structure, labor 
shortages exist in hi-tech fields including semiconductor and 
computer chip design and production, computer software design, flat 
panel and display manufacturing, network-related technology, and 
telecommunications engineering.  To address this issue, Taiwan has 
removed the job experience requirement for foreigners with graduate 
degrees and relaxed restrictions on hiring foreign students or 
recent graduates as interns.  Taiwan began employment of foreign 
blue-collar workers in 1990 when Taiwan was a full employment 
economy with labor shortages.  However, in the early 2000s, the 
relatively high unemployment rate prompted the authorities to 
restrict employment of foreign workers, reducing foreign workers in 
Taiwan by eight percent between 2000 and 2003.  Economic expansion 
in 2004 prompted Taiwan authorities to slightly relax restrictions 
and foreign workers in Taiwan rose 4.6% to 314,034 persons in 2004 
and 4.2% to 327,396 persons in 2005. 
 
¶43.  There are no special hiring practices in Taiwan.  Wages 
typically include a one-month bonus at the end of a year.  Fringe 
benefits often include meals, transportation, and dormitory housing. 
 
TAIPEI 00000073  002 OF 009 
 
 
 Dividend-sharing is common among high-tech industries which, 
however, will be reduced in response to foreign portfolio investors' 
request.  A standard labor insurance program is mandatory.  The 
program provides maternity, retirement, and other benefits.  A new 
retirement system implemented in July 2005 abolishes the voluntary 
retirement scheme under an old system which still covers 30% of 
total employment population.  The old system grants employees with 
voluntary retirement at age of 55 years and a length of service of 
15 years.  Employees hired after July 2005 must join the new system 
with the retirement age being 60.  The new system requires employers 
to contribute six percent of their monthly wage to accounts at 
designated banking institutions.  The accounts follow employees 
transferred from one employer to another.  A universal national 
health insurance system covers all employees and their families. 
 
¶44.  Taiwan provides unemployment relief based on the Employment 
Insurance Law enacted in 2002.  Alternatives for unemployment pay 
include vocational training allowance for jobless persons and 
employment subsidies to encourage employment of jobless persons. 
The Labor Standards Law (LSL) sets a standard eight-hour workday and 
a biweekly maximum of 84 hours.  Legislation adopted in late 2000 
set a five-day workweek for the public sector, effective January 
¶2001.  Over half of private firms have adopted the five-day 
workweek.  The LSL restricts child labor and requires employers to 
provide overtime pay, severance pay, and retirement benefits.  The 
LSL covers both manufacturing and service sectors.  Violators are 
liable to criminal penalties (jail terms) and administrative 
punishments (fines). 
 
¶45.  The minimum wage is set at NT$15,840 (US$487) per month. 
Current manufacturing sector wages average NT$43,958 (US$1,353).  In 
principle, the minimum wage is adjusted in August every year based 
on the results of collective negotiation between the Chinese 
National Federation of Industries and the Chinese Federation of 
Labor Unions.  However, for the past eight years, the minimum wage 
has not been adjusted. 
 
¶46.  Labor unions have become more active and independent since 
Taiwan's martial law was lifted in 1987.  Privatization and the new 
retirement system contributed to an increase in labor disputes in 
¶2005.  Taiwan is not a member of the International Labor 
Organization (ILO) but generally adheres to the ILO convention in 
protection of worker's rights. 
 
--------------------------------- 
¶E. Foreign Trade Zones/Free Ports 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶47.  The first free trade/free port zone began operation at Keelung, 
Taiwan's northern port, in November 2004.  Another four have been 
established in 2005.  These four are located at Taoyuan 
International Airport and the international harbors in Kaohsiung, 
Taichung, and Taipei.  Taiwan authorities have relaxed restrictions 
on movement of merchandise, capital and personnel into and out of 
such zones.  Foreign investors are accorded national treatment. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
¶F. Foreign Direct Investment Statistics 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶48.  Statistics on foreign direct investment in Taiwan are available 
from two sources.  The Investment Commission (IC) publishes monthly 
and yearly foreign investment approval statistics by industry and by 
country.  Taiwan's Central Bank of China (CBC) publishes foreign 
direct investment arrivals on a quarterly and yearly basis.  CBC 
data, contained in balance-of-payments (BOP) statistics, are not 
further classified by industry or country. 
 
TAIPEI 00000073  003 OF 009 
 
 
 
¶49.  In 2005, excess inventory worldwide (particularly electronic 
products) caused Taiwan's export growth to decline to a single-digit 
rate from over 20% in 2004.  Taiwan's private investment declined in 
2005 after over 30% growth in 2004.  Consequently, Taiwan's real GDP 
growth slowed from 6.1% in 2004 to 4.0% in 2005. 
 
¶50.  In 2006, strong recovery of Taiwan's export sector far offset 
adverse effects of delinquent credit/cash card debt problems which 
dampened private consumption in the first half of the year.  Growth 
in exports, which account for over 60% of Taiwan's GDP, accelerated 
from 8.8% in 2005 to 12% in the first quarter and further to 19% in 
the third quarter.  Taiwan authorities estimate economic growth for 
2006 will rise to 4.4%, and private investment will grow in the 
second half of the year.  In 2006, approved FDI in the first ten 
months nearly tripled over the same period of 2005 to US$11.23 
billion.  Approved FDI so far this year was concentrated in 
electronics, banking, science and technology services, and trade. 
These four categories accounted for nearly 90% of total approved 
FDI. 
 
¶51.  Approved direct investment in electronics industries (including 
communications, semiconductor, TFT-LCD and other optical electronic 
projects) increased from 6.4% of total approved FDI prior to 1995 to 
19% in 1996-2000 and further to 24.5% in 2001-2005.  Meanwhile, the 
percentage share for financial services increased from 7.6% prior to 
1995 to 22% in 1996-2000 and 25.6% in 2001-2005.  Sixty percent of 
the approved inbound direct investment in Taiwan's electronics 
industries came from the United States, Europe and Japan. 
 
¶52.  The United States and Japan used to be the two main sources of 
Taiwan's foreign investment, but have been replaced by the tax 
havens in the British Territories in America (BTA), which harbor a 
growing number of multinational corporations (many with roots in 
Taiwan).  Approvals for U.S. investment from 1952 to 2005 totaled 
US$14 billion, or 22% of total foreign investment.  Of total U.S. 
investment, 33% was directed toward the electronics and electrical 
industries, and 42% toward the service sector.  Approvals for 
Japanese investment amounted to US$13 billion, or 20% of total 
foreign investment, of which 28% was in electronics and electrical 
industries and 34% in the service sector.  In 2006, new EU 
investment exceeded that of the United States or Japan due to a 
major holdings transfer by the Philips Company. 
 
¶53.  Approvals for investment from the BTA surged steadily from 
US$76 million in 1994 to US$1.2 billion in 1999 when the BTA 
surpassed the United States and Japan to become the largest source 
of foreign investment in Taiwan.  Investment from the BTA during 
1999-2005 accounted for 27% of total approved investments, compared 
to 18% from the United States, another 18% from Europe, and 15% from 
Japan.  One-quarter of the investment from the BTA was directed 
towards financial services and another quarter to the electronic and 
electrical industries. 
 
¶54.  As a relatively open and liberal economy, Taiwan receives 
foreign investment while its businesses invest overseas, especially 
in China, Southeast Asia and the Americas.  According to 
balance-of-payments statistics compiled by the CBC, outbound direct 
investment has exceeded inbound direct investment every year since 
¶1988.  According to IC statistics, by 2005, cumulative approvals for 
outbound investments totaled US$92 billion.  One of the main 
recipients of Taiwan investment has been China, which has received 
over half of Taiwan's outbound investment.  Approved investments in 
China increased by 19% in 2003, and 51% in 2004, but declined 13% in 
¶2005.  In recent years, over 70% of Taiwan's new overseas investment 
has gone to China. 
 
 
TAIPEI 00000073  004 OF 009 
 
 
¶55.  Taiwan business firms started to relocate their production 
bases to China in the late 1980s.  Production lines in China 
gradually shifted from cheap labor-oriented industries in the late 
1980s to products requiring lower-end technologies, such as PCs and 
motherboards, in the early 2000s.  The WTO accession of China and 
Taiwan in 2002 prompted Taiwanese business firms to accelerate 
relocation to China to sharpen their competitive edge in exports. 
Taiwan factories based in China use the lower labor and land costs 
to process Taiwan-made production inputs into finished goods for 
exports to such industrial markets as the United States, Japan and 
Europe and also for final sale in China. 
 
¶56.  Taiwan's annual registered direct investment across the Taiwan 
Strait grew from US$1.25 billion in 1999 to US$6.94 billion in 2004 
and US$6.0 billion in 2005.  As a result of this trend China-based 
Taiwan factories produced over 40% of export orders received by 
Taiwan companies' headquarters by December 2005, up from 11.5% in 
early 2000, and the 2005 ratio exceeded 70% for electronic firms. 
Greater China (China plus Hong Kong) replaced the United States as 
Taiwan's largest export market in 2001, and Greater China's share of 
Taiwan's exports in the first 11 months of 2006 reached 40%, much 
higher than the 15% for the United States and 11% for the European 
Union.
