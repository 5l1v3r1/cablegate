SUBJECT: UPDATE ON SPANISH DETENTION OF ARGENTINE 
EX-PRESIDENT ISABELITA PERON 
 
REF: MADRID 15 
 
¶1. (U) Following the arrest in Spain of accused Argentine 
death squad leader Rodolfo Almiron on December 28 (ref A), 
Spanish police briefly detained Argentine ex-president Maria 
Estela Martinez (aka Isabelita Peron) on January 12.  The 
police acted on a warrant issued by Argentine magistrate Raul 
Acosta, who accuses Peron of signing three presidential 
decrees in 1975-76 that allowed the armed forces and security 
services to "disappear" people.  The 75-year-old Peron 
appeared before the National Court where Judge Juan del Olmo 
conditionally released her - at the request of the 
prosecutor's office - pending a decision on extradition.  She 
must report to the police every two weeks.  Argentine 
authorities have 40 days to formally request Peron's 
extradition. 
 
¶2. (U) On January 15, the Argentine judge who is processing 
the Almiron case issued a second warrant against Peron, 
accusing her of responsibility for the Triple A death squads 
that Almiron led.  Judge Del Olmo is scheduled to rule on 
that case on January 22.  Peron has lived in Madrid since 
¶1981.
