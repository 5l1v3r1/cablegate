SUBJECT: BAHRAIN TO HOST IRAQ TRADE SHOW IN MARCH 
 
¶1.  Bahrain's Ministry of Industry and Commerce, in 
cooperation with Iraq's Ministry of Trade, will sponsor the 
first "Gulf Iraqi Expo 2007" in Manama, Bahrain March 24-26, 
2007, at the Bahrain International Exhibition Center.  The 
event will feature an exhibition, conference, and 
sector-specific meetings organized by the United Nations 
Industrial Development Organization for business 
participants, all focusing on business opportunities in Iraq. 
 
¶2.  The Embassy received a diplomatic note dated January 7, 
2007, from the Iraqi Embassy in Bahrain requesting our 
cooperation in promoting the event and inviting American 
companies in the region to participate.  We have alerted 
AmCham Bahrain about the show and it is advising its 
membership of the opportunity.  Embassy believes promotion of 
this event by other Embassies in the region, particularly in 
the Gulf, would help make it a success.
