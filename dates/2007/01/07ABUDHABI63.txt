¶2. (SBU) On January 16, Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora 
visited Abu Dhabi as part of his regional tour in advance of 
the January 25 Paris Donors' conference.  According to Yousef 
Al-Otaiba, International Affairs Director for Abu Dhabi Crown 
Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan (MbZ), Siniora had 
a very positive visit -- including a one-on one with UAE 
President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al-Nahyan.  President 
Khalifa publicly stressed the UAE's interest in supporting 
efforts at stabilizing Lebanon and creating a "conducive 
climate for reconstruction and development."  For his part, 
Siniora thanked the UAE for its support noting that "UAE aid 
for the underdeveloped areas of Lebanon has enabled us to 
exert our control and sovereignty in those areas."  Siniora 
also cited Sheikh Khalifa's initiative to clear south Lebanon 
of mines and cluster munitions and the "solidarity project" 
to rebuild schools damaged in the war. 
 
¶3. (SBU) MbZ publicly emphasized the UAE's support for the 
Lebanese government and stated that the UAE was looking 
forward to the Paris Donors' Conference for Lebanon.  He 
called on all Lebanese parties to work toward reconciliation, 
stressing that dialogue among the parties was key to the 
country's stability and security. 
 
¶4. (U) Siniora also met with the UAE's well educated Lebanese 
expatriate community, explaining that Lebanon "was proud" of 
its relationship with the UAE which has been "very supportive 
to us during our most difficult times." 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment:  AbZ and MinState Finance Mohammed Khalfan 
bin Kharbash will attend the Paris Donors' meeting.  MFA's 
Director of Arab Affairs and the Director of the Abu Dhabi 
Fund for Development will also attend.  We believe that the 
UAE will measure the level of its contribution based on the 
contributions of other GCC members.  End Comment.
