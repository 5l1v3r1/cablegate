SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION - SADDAM'S EXECUTION 
 
 
On January 4, conservative, afternoon "La Segunda" (circ. 33,000) 
carried an editorial entitled "Saddam Hussein's End."  Quote: 
 
"The mistakes and excesses committed during the hanging of the ex 
Iraqi dictator may be why the execution of two of his 
collaborators...has been postponed until next Sunday.... President 
Bush's remarks referring to the death of Saddam Hussein as an 
important milestone in Iraq's path toward democracy underestimates 
the reactions of the Sunni minority who supported him.... The key to 
the future lies in the ability of Iraqis to achieve a common mission 
separate from that of the occupying military power or political 
practices imposed from outsiders....  Avoiding a broader conflict... 
requires the cooperation of moderate Islamic forces and 
understanding by foreign nations that besides guaranteeing peace, 
they should allow domestic political development to take place under 
normal conditions....  Thus, it is important that after his tragic 
ending, Saddam's image does not become a symbol of independence."
