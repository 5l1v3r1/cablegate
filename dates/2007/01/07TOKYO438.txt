SUBJECT: JAPAN SUPPORTS U.S. POSITION ON CLUSTER MUNITIONS 
 
REF: STATE 06667 
 
Classified By: Ambassador J.Thomas Schieffer.  Reasons 1.4 (B) (D) 
 
¶1. (SBU) This message contains an action request.  See para 8. 
 
¶2. (C) Summary.  Japan supports the U.S. position on cluster 
munitions (CM) and believes that the Convention on Certain 
Conventional Weapons (CCW) is the best venue for discussing 
the issue, according to MOFA officials.  Japanese authorities 
are ""bewildered"" by Norway's attempt to circumvent the CCW 
process, but understand that the Oslo initiative will not 
seek a total ban on CM.  End Summary. 
 
¶3. (C) On January 30, Embassy political officer delivered 
reftel demarche seeking Japan's cooperation on cluster 
munitions (CM) to Maiko Tamagawa in MOFA's Conventional Arms 
Division.  Tamagawa promised to pass the demarche to the 
International Policy Planning Division at the Ministry of 
Defense (MOD).  MOD officials will review reftel proposal for 
direct military-to-military discussions on the use of CM and 
provide a response as soon as possible, she said.  Tamagawa 
asked that the U.S. provide specific information and details 
on how the direct dialogue would take shape. 
 
¶4. (C) According to Tamagawa, Japan maintains CM for 
defensive purposes, believing such weapons to be both 
necessary and effective.  At the same time, discussion in the 
Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) should take 
into account the humanitarian issues associated with the use 
of cluster munitions.  Japan looks to balance the 
humanitarian vs. military-security aspects of CM.  However, 
in order to be effective, the discussion on CM must involve 
the main countries that produce, possess, and use CM, she 
said.  Japan believes that the CCW is the most appropriate 
venue for discussing CM because the convention provides a 
forum in which the countries that are most involved in the 
use of cluster munitions can attempt to balance CM's 
humanitarian vs. military aspects. 
 
¶5. (C) Japanese officials are ""bewildered,"" Tamagawa said, by 
Norway's move to go outside of the CCW process at a time when 
the CCW is just about to discuss the issue.  She said that it 
would be important for all the parties to have substantive 
talks at the next CCW session so as not to boost Norway's 
effort to go outside the CCW process.  Japanese officials 
have heard, however, that the Norway proposal is not intended 
to exclude discussion on CM at the CCW.  The Norwegians, she 
noted, do not seek to obtain the kind of total ban on CM 
that, e.g., the Ottawa Treaty imposes on anti-personnel 
landmines. 
 
¶6. (C) Norway did not invite Japan to the Oslo conference and 
Tokyo is considering whether it will ask for an invitation, 
Tamagawa reported.  Tokyo authorities have heard that 
Australia, Canada, Finland, and Italy are likewise 
considering whether or not to request invitations.  Japan 
will attend the April ICRC meeting in Montreux, where Tokyo 
hopes a have a more balanced discussion vis--vis the 
negotiations that are expected to take place at the Oslo 
meeting.  Tamagawa noted that the June 19-22 government 
experts meeting would take stock of the ICRC gathering, 
thereby giving the April Montreux discussion added 
importance.  Japanese officials have not yet developed a 
final position on the potential legal or political 
restrictions on CM use that might arise during the 
negotiations. 
 
¶7. (C) Tamagawa said that, for domestic political reasons, 
the Japanese government would find it impossible to ignore 
CM.  Public interest in CM, and in Norway's proposed Oslo 
conference, continues to grow.  Newspapers and other media 
have reported on the issue, and a few NGO's have expressed 
support for the Oslo process.  MOFA expects some opposition 
Diet members to take up the issue during the current 
legislative session. 
 
¶8. (C) ACTION REQUEST:  Per Tamagawa's request, please 
provide more specific information on the proposed 
military-to-military discussions on the use of CM.
