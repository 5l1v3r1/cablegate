¶1. (SBU)  Scientists at NAMRU-3 reported to Emboff on January 
21 that the H5N1 avian influenza virus responsible for the 
death of an Egyptian woman on January 19 does not contain the 
genetic mutation (N294S) that shows resistance to oseltamivir 
(Tamiflu).  (Note: On January 16, alarm bells sounded when 
the CDC confirmed that two H5N1 deaths in Gharbiya in late 
December (reftel) showed a mutation indicating moderate 
resistance to Tamiflu.  End Note.)   NAMRU-3 officials 
informed counterparts at the Ministry of Health and 
Population (MOHP) of the most recent finding, who breathed a 
sigh of relief for the time being as Egypt has stockpiled 
massive amounts of Tamiflu, a primary defense against the 
avian influenza virus. 
 
¶2.  (U)  The latest victim was a twenty-seven year old 
housewife from Biba City in the central Egyptian governorate 
of Beni Suef who had been raising hens in her home.  She was 
admitted to the El-Omrania chest hospital in Giza on January 
13 with pneumonia-like symptoms.  The patient was 
administered Tamiflu, but succumbed to the disease, bringing 
the total number of deaths to 11 out of 19 confirmed cases 
since February 2006.  Worldwide, H5N1 has a 60% mortality 
rate, including those administered Tamiflu. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Following the CDC's January 16 confirmation of 
Tamiflu resistance in the Gharbiya cases (reftel), the WHO 
issued a press release stating, "at this time there is not 
indication at oseltamivir (Tamilflu) resistance is widespread 
in Egypt or elsewhere," and noted that the public health 
ramifications are limited.  Human-to-human transmission in 
Egypt has not been confirmed in any of the 19 cases to date. 
 While Tamiflu resistance still cannot be characterized as 
widespread, NAMRU, in conjunction with MOHP, will closely 
monitor all emerging AI cases for this and other mutations.
