SUBJECT: SECTION 1206 PROPOSAL FINAL COORDINATION 
 
REF: STATE 3112 
 
Â¶1. (U) Embassy continues to support the funding proposals for 
Indonesia that are identified in reftel and urges that these 
proposals be notified to Congress.  Although we did not 
receive funding for all of our 1206 proposals for 2007, those 
that were funded represent a coherent and effective program 
which will significantly increase Indonesia's maritime 
capability in its eastern waters.  Additional funding in 
subsequent years, if it becomes available, would allow that 
capability to be further enhanced.
