SUBJECT:  Taiwan's New Central Bank Deputy Governor 
 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY.  Taiwan's Central Bank of China (CBC) will promote 
Foreign Exchange Department (FED) Director General George Chou (Chou 
A-ding)  to be Deputy Governor (DG) in mid-February.  CBC Governor 
Perng Fai-nan's two deputies will now be career central bankers. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  An informed source of the CBC confirmed to AIT/T that Chou, 64, 
will be promoted to be DG of the CBC on February 15 when incumbent 
DG Liang Fa-chin, an academic economist, finishes his five-year term 
of office.  Chou, 64, joined the CBC Economic Research Department in 
1967 and was reassigned to the FED in 1971.  He moved up steadily to 
Deputy Director General of the FED in 1992.  He was sent to London 
to serve as Taiwan's first Central Bank representative in May 1997. 
Nine months later, he was promoted to Director General of the FED in 
early March 1998 when an air accident at Taipei's International 
Airport killed then CBC Governor Sheu Yuan-dong and FED Director 
General Cyril Chen. 
 
¶3.  With Chou's promotion, both of the two DGs will be career 
central bankers.  The other incumbent DG (Hsu Yi-hsiung) had worked 
for the CBC Banking Department for a long time before he was 
promoted to DG in 1998. 
 
¶4.  In the past, the CBC Governor has been assisted by a career 
central banker and an economist.  Under this type of organization, 
economists Shea Jia-dong and Hu Sheng-cheng had been DG of the CBC. 
Both Shea and Hu had served as Director of the Institute of 
Economics under Academia Sinica before they were appointed as DG of 
the CBC.  Currently, Shea is Chairman of the state-owned Central 
Trust of China and Hu is Chairman of the Council for Economic 
Planning and Development.
