¶1. On January 4, conservative, influential newspaper-of-record "El 
Mercurio" (circ. 129,000) ran an editorial entitled "Iran 
Sanctions."  Quote: 
 
¶2. "The U.N. Security Council adopted resolution 1737.... The crisis 
between the international community and Iran has deepened due to 
(Iran's) nuclear development plan...  This reflects the increasing 
danger posed by various nations or groups interested in acquiring 
nuclear materials and thus gain the ability to construct an 
arsenal....  This situation is the beginning of a war of nerves that 
must be followed with special attention by the powers and that is 
witnessed with apprehension by the rest of the world."
