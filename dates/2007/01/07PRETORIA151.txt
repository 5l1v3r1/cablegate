Reserves up on Firmer Rand 
-------------------------- 
¶2. (U) The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) stepped up the pace of 
reserves accumulation in December, with gross reserves up 2.3% on 
the back of a relatively stronger rand.  Gross reserves rose to 
$25.6 billion in December, up from November's $25.04 billion. 
Analysts said that current rand weakness was likely to lead to a 
moderate slowing in reserves accumulation, but the Bank was likely 
to resume activity in the market should the rand move below R7 to 
the dollar.  Net reserves, also known as the international liquidity 
position, increased to $22.98 billion, up $817 million from 
November.  SARB said the increase in net reserves was as result of a 
repayment of $250 million of a three-year, $1 billion syndicated 
loan entered into in 2004.  Analysts said the increase in reserves 
should be seen as positive for the rand. (Business Day, January 09) 
 
Record 2006 Vehicle Sales 
------------------------- 
¶3. (U) New vehicle sales in SA romped to a new high as 714,340 
vehicles were driven off the shop floor last year, 15.7% more than 
the number sold in 2005.  This was the first time SA's new vehicle 
sales surpassed the 700,000 mark.  Following sales growth of 28% in 
2005 and 25.9% in 2004, this performance ensured that SA's vehicle 
market was again one of the best-performing in the world.  However, 
2007 would be more challenging, with the domestic new car market 
likely to move sideways or register modest growth at best.  The 
National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of SA (NAAMSA) 
expects that the industry should sell around 771,000 new vehicles in 
2007, a 7.95% increase over 2006.  The four interest rate hikes in 
2006 began to have a restraining effect on new car sales towards 
year-end, and last month saw a second successive monthly drop in 
sales.  Another key factor in the industry's performance this year 
would be higher vehicle pricing due to serious cost pressures. 
However, NAAMSA anticipates production to reach record levels this 
year on the back of the roll-out of major export programs, strong 
growth of the economy, business confidence and corporate 
profitability.  Exports last year totaled 179,854 vehicles or 28.5% 
more than the 139,912 vehicles exported during 2005.  Naamsa expects 
the trend to continue, with exports to exceed 220,000 this year.

SA Tourism Growth Robust 
------------------------ 
 
¶4. (U) Speaking at a conference in Holland, Environmental Affairs 
and Tourism Minister Marthinus van Schalkwyk said that SA's tourism 
industry is on a roll.  Recently released statistics for the period 
January-July 2006 showed a 15.8% increase in tourism arrivals to SA, 
growing faster than anywhere else in the world.  More than 4.6 
million people visited SA during the period under review, 
outstripping the 2005 half-yearly figure by 636,610.  In his 
address, Van Schalkwyk also referred to SA's tourism preparations 
for the 2010 Soccer World Cup, saying visitors to the event would 
have a wealth of choices for accommodation.  In previous 
tournaments, he said, only hotels were contracted to accommodate 
people, whereas SA will ensure that visitors to the 2010 World Cup 
are treated to a uniquely African experience.  "For the first time 
in World Cup history, non-hotel accommodation such as national park 
accommodation, lodges, guest houses, and bed and breakfasts will 
also be contracted," he said.  (News24, January 09) 
 
Xstrata SA 'Fully Empowered' 
--------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) Xstrata, the global mining company, has announced a R575m 
 
PRETORIA 00000151  002.2 OF 003 
 
 
empowerment deal on its Rhovan vanadium facility near Brits in North 
West Province, which it says completes its empowerment requirements 
in South Africa.  According to Xstrata, the transaction will 
complete the facilitation of meaningful black participation in 
Xstrata's South African operations, as required by the ownership 
provisions of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act of 
¶2002.  The Bakwena Ba Mogopa Traditional Community has agreed to 
purchase a 26% stake in the company through a pooling and sharing 
venture, where the local community contributes the surface rights 
above the ore body.  Xstrata's other empowerment deals include a 
partnership with Merafe, its Motololo empowerment deal announced in 
February 2006, and its coal partnership with African Rainbow 
Minerals also announced last February.  The Bakwena Ba Mogopa 
Traditional Community is also African Platinum's empowerment partner 
on the Leeuwkop project in the same area. (I-Net Bridge, January

BEE Codes Unlikely to Boost Value of Deals 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶6. (U) Even though the black economic empowerment (BEE) Codes of 
Good Practice are ready to be written into law, the value of BEE 
deals is not expected to be in excess of R60 billion ($8.3 billion) 
in 2007.  According to BusinessMap Foundation BEE research director 
Colin Reddy, most of the bigger deals, i.e., those larger than R500 
million ($70 million), have already been completed.  Reddy estimated 
that the total value of BEE deals in 2006 was between R50 billion 
($7 billion) and R60 billion ($8.3 billion).  Deals worth R55 
billion ($7.6 billion) were recorded in 2005, compared with R62 
billion ($8.6 billion) in 2004. (Business Report, January 10) 
 
Capital Formation at Highest Level in 16 Years 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶7. (U) Capital spending in South Africa is at its highest level 
since 1990, according to data published by the South African Reserve 
Bank (SARB).  The data indicate that capital spending in the third 
quarter of 2006 was almost 19% of GDP.  The increased spending on 
capital was largely driven by strong domestic demand, business 
optimism, high capacity utilization rates, and parastatal spending. 
Increased investment will raise the growth potential of the economy 
and help to relieve infrastructure and supply bottlenecks that have 
caused the economy to overheat in the past.  From a peak of 28% of 
GDP in 1982/83, capital spending declined steadily over the next 10 
years, bottoming out at less than 15% of GDP at the time of the 
democratic transition in 1993/94.  The decline in public sector 
capital spending was especially sharp during these years, as 
parastatals lost access to foreign capital markets because of 
sanctions.  Unfortunately, the picture did not improve after the ANC 
took power in 1994, and investment hovered around 15% of GDP 
throughout the 1990's as the government had to bring the fiscal 
deficits under control and struggled with slow implementation of 
projects.  However, capital spending picked up steadily since 2002 
and is poised to become a vital driver of the economy. 
 
 House Price Growth Seen Easing 
------------------------------ 
 
¶8. (U) According to the latest ABSA house price index, house prices 
grew by 15.2% in 2006 compared to 22.7% in 2005.  This brought the 
average price of a house to about R857,400 ($120,000) at the end of 
¶2006.  ABSA senior economist Jacques du Toit said the decreased 
affordability of housing had driven the declining trend.  He expects 
the declining trend to continue in 2007 as a result of a tighter 
economy and higher interest rates.  However, he expects the 
residential market to turn around and experience a gradual upward 
trend in price growth in 2008 on the back of an expected lower 
interest rate and inflation environment that year.  Du Toit said 
nominal house-price growth of about 9% was forecast for 2007 with 
prices set to increase about 3% in real terms.  House-price growth 
was expected to improve to above 10% on a nominal basis during 2008 
and into 2009.  Meanwhile, Sotheby's International Realty said SA's 
property prices were starting to catch up with those in the "globe's 
most desirable locations." (News24, January 11) 
 
Foreign Buyers 'Driven Off' 
--------------------------- 
 
¶9. (U) Cape Town-based international remortgaging firm Bond Busters 
 
PRETORIA 00000151  003.2 OF 003 
 
 
said consistent negative overseas press coverage about crime, former 
deputy president Jacob Zuma, and the threat of foreign buying 
restrictions in SA could be behind the drop in foreign buying of 
residential property in the country.  According to the latest First 
National Bank residential property barometer, foreigners made up 4% 
of property buyers in SA in the fourth quarter of 2006, a 
significant reduction from the 7% recorded a year previously.  Ian 
Wason, joint managing director of Bond Busters, says he believes the 
drop in foreign buyers were due to the negative sentiment regarding 
SA.  He said that many conflicting statements on foreign ownership 
had caused many buyers to give up on acquiring property here. 
"Overseas press, particularly in the UK, is always keen to bash SA 
whenever they get the opportunity," said Wason.  (Business Day,
