SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION - VENEZUELA 
 
 
¶1.  On January 10, Chile's conservative, independent "La Tercera" 
(circ. 101,000) carried an editorial entitled "Venezuela and 
Twenty-First Century Socialism."  Quote: 
 
¶2.  "Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has clearly shown his 
intention of deepening what he calls 'Twenty-First Century 
Socialism'....  The first signs were given by the appointment of his 
new cabinet....  He also raised alarming signs regarding freedom of 
expression by not renewing the concession of the oldest television 
station in Venezuela, arguing it is a medium that 'favors a 
coup'.... 
 
¶3.  "The Venezuelan President's new administration is also starting 
with announcements of nationalizations in two key areas of the 
economy:  telecommunications and electricity....  Although it is a 
fact that Venezuela as a sovereign state can choose whatever path it 
estimates most convenient, and that President Chavez was elected 
with 60 percent of the votes in open elections, the latest announced 
measures cause uneasiness. 
 
¶4.  "Considering that Venezuela does not have a required 
counterweight...his decisions are aimed against...freedoms and 
counteract what appears to be benefiting the majority in the region: 
 increased economic openness, support for globalization, and a 
rejection of the confrontational discourse.  Thus it would be 
desirable to have greater synchronization with the rest of Latin 
America because measures such as the ones announced do not 
contribute to needed regional integration."
