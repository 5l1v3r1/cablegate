¶1. Italian DCM Sergio Martes, Italian military attache Colonel 
Claudio Ritacca, Embassy Kyiv Office of Defense Cooperation Chief 
LTC Rob Timm, and poloff delivered reftel demarche January 25 to MFA 
Arms Control and Military Technical Cooperation Department Director 
Volodymyr Belashov and Counselor Gennadiy Shalev.  Belashov said the 
Ministry of Defense (MOD) had military police units and the Ministry 
of Interior (MOI) also had police forces that might qualify for and 
be interested in the training.  He would transmit the information 
immediately to both ministries with a recommendation that they 
respond positively to the offer. 
 
¶2. Belashov was uncertain, and Shalev expressed strong dismay, over 
the abbreviated timeline required for a response.  Belashov opined 
that the Ukrainians would be likely to respond positively, but would 
not be able to nominate qualified candidates in time for the March 
courses.  He hoped that Ukrainians could be accepted to courses 
later this year or next year.  He welcomed our indications, in 
response to his inquiry, that travel expenses of Ukrainian 
participants could be covered.  Belashov explained that only the 
Foreign Ministry had a budget authorized for foreign travel.  Other 
Ukrainian ministries, like MOD or MOI, had to get specific approval 
from the Cabinet of Ministers for such travel.  Foreign funding 
would eliminate the requirement for such approval and expedite a 
Ukrainian response. 
 
¶3. Shalev asked a series of questions both during and in the 
corridor after the meeting to clear up discrepancies between the 
Italian Embassy English-language backgrounder and details in the 
Ukrainian language diplomatic note.  Shalev said his ministry 
counterparts would react to information about COESPU with numerous 
questions, to which he needed to be prepared; we provided details on 
the number and ranks of prospective attendees to both courses and 
the course start dates.  We noted that, once the Ukrainian 
government provided its affirmative intent to participate in the 
training, a mobile assistance team could deploy quickly to provide 
answers to such specific questions and to coordinate in preparation 
for Ukraine's COESPU participation.
