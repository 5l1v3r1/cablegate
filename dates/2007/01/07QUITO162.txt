¶1.  (SBU)  Summary: In a brief but cordial bilateral meeting 
on the eve of the inauguration of President Rafael Correa, 
Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez met with Foreign 
 
SIPDIS 
Minister-designate Maria Fernanda Espinosa on January 14. 
Both agreed that more unites our countries than divides them, 
and that frank dialogue based in mutual respect is the best 
means to deepen areas of mutual interest.  Espinosa expressed 
GOE interest in USG treatment of Ecuadorian residents, ATPDEA 
extension, and continued USG assistance programs.  Secretary 
Gutierrez emphasized USG goodwill toward the entering 
government, laid down his own marker on unhelpful rhetoric, 
and offered his commitment to help maintain friendly 
relations.  End Summary. 
 
Background 
---------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Secretary of Commerce, visiting Ecuador as the 
chief of the USDel to the Correa inauguration, was 
accompanied by Ambassador Jewell, Commerce DAS Walter 
Bastian, and PolChief (notetaker).  The meeting, which 
started late and was constrained by other events, lasted 
approximately twenty minutes.  Espinosa was joined by MFA 
Coordinator General Rafael Paredes, who she introduced as her 
VFM-designate.  Press photographers covered the opening of 
the meeting. 
 
Warm Welcome 
------------ 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Espinosa warmly welcomed Gutierrez,s visit as head 
of the USDel to the inauguration, expressing GOE appreciation 
and emphasizing the &enormous positive agenda8 bringing 
Ecuador and the United States together.  The Secretary 
reciprocated the warm greeting, saying he came to Ecuador to 
signal &above all, USG respect of Ecuador,s importance and 
sovereignty,8 agreeing that the two countries have much in 
common and much to be proud of.  He expressed optimism that 
those who wished to divide us would not succeed.  He 
described his own heritage as an example of the growing bonds 
which unite our increasingly integrated hemisphere. 
 
Ties that Bind 
-------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Espinosa reciprocated the sentiment, emphasizing 
her willingness to maintain &frank, open and permanent 
dialogue with the U.S.,8 already begun with the Ambassador. 
Relations with the U.S. are especially important to the GOE, 
she said, not only because the U.S. is Ecuador,s largest 
trade partner, but also because so many Ecuadorians now live 
there.  The GOE is very interested that Ecuadorians receive 
fair treatment in the U.S., she said, and welcomes the 
orientation of immigration reforms currently being discussed 
in the United States.  Another tie that binds us, she said, 
is that of education represented in countless people, 
including herself (a Rutgers Ph.D.) and president-elect 
Correa (a U. Illinois Ph.D.), who had studied in the United 
States. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Espinosa expressed Ecuador,s gratitude for the 
important assistance the USG has extended over the years, but 
noted with concern that aid levels are on the decline due to 
competing demands.  &Please do not forget Latin America,8 
she said, citing USAID,s important support for the 
environment, protection of the Galapagos Islands, and 
development of Ecuador,s northern border region near 
Colombia.  She expressed appreciation for the recent visit by 
CoDel Reid, saying the new government was very optimistic 
about the possibility of ATPDEA extension and continued trade 
relations over the longer term. 
 
Agreeing to Disagree, Respectfully 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) While some issues will inevitably divide us, 
Espinosa continued, the new government firmly believes that 
dialogue is the most appropriate way to overcome them.  She 
used Colombia as an example of a country with which they have 
a significant disagreement right now but which they hope to 
solve with dialogue.  Secretary Gutierrez agreed that frank 
dialogue was most effective, suggesting also that public 
statements are important, and that harmful rhetoric could set 
back relations unnecessarily. 
 
Looking Outward 
--------------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Turning to Ecuador,s regional aspirations, 
Espinosa said the Correa Government wanted to &radiate peace 
and integration8 throughout the region.  She hoped to be 
able to take advantage of is strategic position to play a 
special role to advance efforts at integration beyond just 
lowering tarriffs to rebuilding the Community of Andean 
Nations, promoting interdependence by extending 
infrastructure and energy networks, and opening the continent 
to services.  &There is much more to do,8 she said, and 
Ecuador welcomes the collaboration of the United States. 
Secretary Gutierrez agreed to the benefits of openness and 
 
SIPDIS 
encouraged the GOE to integrate economically with its 
neighbors and beyond, citing U.S. membership beyond NAFTA to 
ASEAN. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) In closing, Espinosa regretted that the meeting was 
short by necessity, pledging to maintain frank and permanent 
dialogue with the USG through the Ambassador.  The Secretary 
thanked the FM-designate for the meeting, saying the U.S. 
wished to remain a friend to Ecuador, and that Ecuador could 
count him among its many friends in the United States.
