SUBJECT: FINNISH RESPONSE -- FULL COURT PRESS FOR 
AFGHANISTAN AT JANUARY 26 INFORMAL NATO FOREIGN MINISTERIAL 
 
REF: SECSTATE 7434 
 
Classified By: POLCHIEF GREGORY THOME FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
 
¶1. (SBU) PolChief discussed NATO/ISAF's new 
"Comprehensive Approach" to bolstering the mission in 
Afghanistan and the Jan. 26 and Feb. 8 NATO ministerials 
(reftels) with Finnish Roving Ambassador to Afghanistan 
Antti Koistinen and MFA Director for Security Policy 
Kimmo Lahdevirta on Jan. 25. 
 
Increased Finnish Assistance 
---------------------------- 
¶2. (SBU) Koistinen welcomed the rollout of the 
"Comprehensive Strategy," saying that the GOF shares the 
concerns of NATO and the US and that the Strategy 
represents a crucial initiative to undermine any 
potential spring/summer Taliban initiative.  It is very 
important to take the situation seriously now, he added, 
because the security situation could be "very hot" come 
spring.  The GOF is particularly focused on the 
narcotics trade and the funding streams this is creating 
for Taliban fighters.  In response, Finland is seeking 
to identify good long-term strategies and "also 
contributing money now," Koistinen added. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Regarding specific contributions, Lahdevirta 
explained that Finland intends to maintain its 100-plus 
troop contribution to PRTs in Meymenah and Mazir-al- 
Sharif, as well as its Euro 10 million annual 
reconstruction package through at least 2010.  In 
addition, Finland will: 
 
 -- Increase its bilateral contribution to the Law and 
Order Trust Fund ten fold, from Euros 100,000 to 1 
million; 
 
 -- make additional contributions (Euro amount TBD) to 
munitions disposal programs; and 
 
 -- provide an additional 10 trainers to a proposed EU 
police training mission, once the EU approves that 
initiative. 
 
¶4. (C) Lahdevirta also indicated that Finland would re- 
 
examine the possibility of contributing non-lethal 
equipment to either the Afghan National Army or the 
Afghan National Police.  The GOF rejected a US request 
last year to provide lethal equipment, based domestic 
political considerations and on a clause in its export 
control legislation that prevents exporting lethal 
equipment to "war torn" areas.  However, Lahdevirta said 
that the MOD was now drawing up a plan for consideration 
by the Cabinet (possibly as soon as February) to 
contribute non-lethal equipment including generators and 
communication gear. 
 
US Presence 
----------- 
¶5. (C) Finally, Koistinen and Lahdevirta warmly welcomed 
our reassurances that the US does not intend to cut 
troops in Afghanistan.  "Rumors have indeed been 
circulating" in Europe regarding US intentions, 
Lahdevirta said, adding that a clear statement from the 
US at the Summits reaffirming its commitment in 
Afghanistan -- in addition to SecDef Gates' recent 
comments -- would do much to dispel those rumors once 
and for all.
