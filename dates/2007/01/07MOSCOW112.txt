¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a Pre-license check to determine 
the legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, JSC 
Vremya-Ch, Nizhny Novgorod, Russia. The company is 
listed on BIS license application D368426 as the 
ultimate consignee of 10 converters, model: AD9460BSV- 
¶105. These items are controlled for national security, 
nuclear non-proliferation reasons under ECCN 3A001. 
The licensee is Analog Devices, 3 Technology Way, 
Norwood, MA 02062. 
 
¶3. On December 27, 2006, Export Control Attache Donald 
Pearce and FSN Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested pre-license check at the offices of JSC 
Vremya-Ch, 67, Osharskaya St., Nizhny Novgorod, 
Russia. The export control team met with Dr. Sergey 
Medvedev, Chief of IT Division and Dr. Boris Sakharov, 
Head Engineer. 
 
¶4. Vremya-Ch was founded in 1993 as a provider of 
precision equipment maintenance for the Nizhny 
Novgorod Institute of Electronic Measuring Instruments 
Kvarz.  The founders and many of the employees of 
Vremya-Ch are former employees and/or students at 
Kvarz.  Currently Vremya-Ch produces a line of 
frequency and time standards and frequency comparison 
devices used in precision applications such as 
telecommunications, navigational reference systems and 
radio astronomy.  Vremya-Ch is a Joint Stock Company, 
with 10% of the stock owned by Gosstandart, the 
Russian Federation Standards organization and the 
remaining shares privately held.   The company employs 
200, and owns three floors of a multiple-tenant 
industrial building in Nizhny Novgorod. 
 
¶5. Drs. Medvedev and Sakharov are familiar with both 
U.S. and Government of Russia (GOR) export 
regulations.  Dr. Medvedev estimates that 50% of 
Vremya-Ch's profits come from exports, and the company 
frequently does business with U.S. companies such as 
Analog Devices and Frequency Electronics, Inc. Dr. 
Medvedev told the team about a 2001 end use check 
conducted by the Federal Service for Technical and 
Export Control of the Russian Federation on a client 
in China, the Beijing Institute of Radio Metrology and 
Measurement (BIRMM).  The check was favorable, and the 
equipment was exported.  Drs. Medvedev and Sakharov 
both stressed the importance of export control 
compliance, as the company depends on the revenue from 
export sales and realizes the importance of the 
control of dual-use commodities. 
 
¶6. Dr. Medvedev gave the following list of other 
export clients: Switzerland: the Neuchatel 
Observatory, Oscilloquartz Company, TNT-Temex 
Neuchatel Time Company. Germany: Physikalish- 
Technische Bundesanstalt (German Bureau of Standards), 
Institute for Experimental Physics at Heinrich Heine 
University. Australia: Commonwealth Scientific and 
Industrial Research Organization, Australia Telescope 
National Facility Poland: AM Technologies Polska. 
Kazakhstan: "KazInMetr"(Kazakhstan Institute of 
Metrology).  Belarus: State Institute of Metrology. 
China: National Institute of Metrology Technology 
Inc., Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, Chinese 
Academy of Science, China Xinshidai Company, EZ Tech 
Electronics Technology Company, Ltd., China Great Wall 
Industry Corporation.  NOTE: Dr. Medvedev indicated 
that he was familiar with the sanctions on China Great 
Wall Industry Corporation, and stated that the sales 
were in the time frame between 1994 and 2004.  END 
NOTE. 
 
¶7. The company does not manufacture equipment for 
specific military purposes or projects, and does not 
have any affiliation with weapons design or production 
programs.  The company has contracts and continuing 
business arrangements with the following Russian 
organizations: All-Russian Scientific Research 
Institute for Physical-Technical And Radio-Technical 
Measurements, Korolev Space Center Mission Control, 
Federal State Unitary Enterprise-Research Institute of 
 
semiconductor Devices, Federal State Unitary 
Enterprise-Russian Institute of Space Device 
Engineering. 
 
¶8. The equipment in reftel will be used to integrate 
digital signal processing (DSP) into the current 
product line.  Currently the company only uses DSP in 
radio frequency (RF) tuning and calibration of crystal 
oscillators.  With DSP capabilities, Dr. Sakharov 
hopes to design wide band RF comparison standards and 
equipment.  Three specialists will have direct access 
to the equipment in reftel.  The equipment will be 
stored in a locked closet inside of the fabrication 
area of the facility, which is guarded at all times by 
a security officer.  All areas of the facility are 
limited to authorized personnel.  A proximity card 
system and video surveillance security system are 
utilized to control access. 
 
¶9. Recommendations: Post recommends JSC Vremya-Ch, 
Nizhny Novgorod, Russia, as reliable recipients of 
sensitive U.S. origin commodities. It is requested 
that post be notified of final disposition of the 
application, and of any shipments for this 
organization in order to conduct appropriate FCS 
follow-up and statistical reporting.
