¶1.  Summary.  Japan has signed a contract with a construction 
company, SAITA of Afghanistan, to complete its 114 km segment 
of the Afghan Ring Road (Kandahar to Herat), and expects work 
to be completed by December 2008, if not sooner. MOFA 
International Cooperation Bureau Grant Aid/Technical 
Cooperation Division Director Wada said that on January 20, 
2007 SAITA began construction on the first ten kilometers. 
End summary. 
 
¶2.  In Fall 2006, the initial contract for this section of 
the Ring Road was canceled due to security concerns and 
Taisei's employees departed Afghanistan.  A new tender was 
issued to include third parties (other companies in addition 
to Japanese and Afghan companies.)  Negotiations with an 
Indian company were undertaken, however  no agreement was 
reached.  As a result, Japanese procurement agent, the Japan 
International Cooperation System (JICS) issued yet another 
tender  requesting bids by early December.  MOFA Grant 
Aid/Technical Cooperation Division Director Mitsuhiro Wada 
said of four companies submitting bids, the best bid was from 
SAITA of Afghanistan.  On December 26, 2006, the Government 
of Afghanistan, through JICS, signed an agreement with SAITA 
of Afghanistan (a Japanese invested firm) to construct the 
Road.  In addition, a Japanese engineering services firm, 
Pacific Consultants International (PCI), was contracted to 
provide the technical oversight. 
 
¶3.  Director Wada reported that SAITA began construction on 
January 20, 2007, with PCI providing technical oversight. 
 
¶4.  Director Wada said that the contracting system is 
somewhat complicated.  MOFA initially only had sufficient 
funds to cover the first 50 kilometers, and asked the Afghan 
Government through JICS to issue the contract accordingly. 
MOFA is now waiting a formal request from the Afghan 
Government for grant funds to complete the remaining 64 
kilometers.  Once the request is received, MOFA will 
calculate the necessary funding, and obtain budget approvals 
from the Ministry of Finance and the Cabinet, so that the 
funding can be issued during 2006 fiscal year (FY 2006 ends 
March 31, 2007.).  Director Wada assured AID Counselor that 
funding is not a problem, but these administrative procedures 
must be followed. 
 
¶5.  Director Wada also told AID Counselor that the Afghan 
Government and JICS would approve and sign a contract with 
SAITA of Afghanistan for the final 64 kilometers, perhaps 
following the same procedure of constructing 10 kilometers at 
a time.  Director Wada assured that the 114 kilometers from 
Kandahar to Herat would be completed by December 2008 if not 
earlier. 
 
¶6.  MOFA recently appointed senior official, Yoshiki Mine, as 
the Ambassador in Charge of Afghanistan Assistance 
Coordination and NGOs.  Director Wada reported that the Ring 
Road is one of Mine's highest priorities.
