SUBJECT: WHTI IN ALBERTA AND SASKATACHEWAN: ALMOST FULL COMPLIANCE ON 
DAY ONE 
 
REF: STATE 7396 
 
¶1.  The four airports in Calgary's consular district with direct 
flights to the US--Calgary, Edmonton, Regina, and 
Saskatoon--reported no problems on the first day of WHTI 
implementation. No passengers were turned away from any of the 
four airports for lack of a passport. Almost every passenger 
arrived with a passport, and the few without passports reported 
that they had passport applications in progress. 
 
¶2.  Calgary Airport had 100% compliance for much of the morning. 
 Several WestJet passengers arrived without passports for 
late-morning flights, but WestJet ticket agents processed the 
passengers through to Customs and Border Protection (CBP) 
Preclearance, who allowed the passengers to board without being 
referred to secondary processing.  Edmonton CBP reported just 
two passengers without passports by late morning, both of whom 
were allowed to board. 
 
¶3.  Regina and Saskatoon Airports in Saskatchewan do not have 
CBP Preclearance officers, but the airlines there reported 100% 
compliance: by late morning, no passengers had arrived at either 
airport without a passport. 
 
¶4.  Many media representatives were at Calgary Airport, 
interviewing passengers, airline staff, airport officials, and 
CBP (CBP officers had been granted permission to speak with the 
media on the first day of WHTI implementation only) about the 
new passport requirements.  A newspaper reporter who spoke with 
Vice Consul expressed mild disappointment that "there doesn't 
seem to be a story here...everything's going fine."
