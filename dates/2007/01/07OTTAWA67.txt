SUBJECT: CANADIAN VIEWS ON MERCURY AT UPCOMING UNEP 
GOVERNING COUNCIL 
 
REF: 06 STATE 202028 
 
¶1.  ESTH Counselor discussed Canadian positions on the UNEP 
Mercury Program with Grace Howland, manager for heavy metals 
in the Hazardous Air Pollutants Branch at Environment Canada, 
on January 12.  Howland expects to attend the UNEP Governing 
Council meeting in Nairobi next month. 
 
¶2.  Howland reported that Canada would not support a proposal 
to begin negotiations on a legally binding treaty to control 
mercury as currently configured, but admitted Canada is still 
studying the issue.  That being said, Canada fully supports 
the partnership approach favored by the U.S. and participates 
actively in and financially supports four of the five 
partnerships (except for artisanal and small scale gold 
mining), and recently hosted a meeting of the fate and 
transport research partnership, which included participation 
by Italy, Japan, and the EPA, among others.  Canada agrees 
with the U.S. view that negotiating a binding agreement would 
be a lengthy and costly endeavor and that partnerships 
provide a mechanism to involve the private sector and other 
stakeholders in activities that produce near-term results. 
Howland stressed ongoing close consultation with the U.S. and 
expects to participate in a JUSCANZ mercury teleconference 
next week. 
 
¶3.  Like the U.S., Canada no longer has any primary mercury 
mining, and is less interested in the establishment of a goal 
to reduce the use of mercury than work on atmospheric 
emissions.  Canada is still developing its own views on 
limiting trade in mercury.
