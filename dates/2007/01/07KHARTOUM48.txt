¶1. (SBU) Summary:  On a day-long visit to Darfur January 9, New 
Mexico Governor Bill Richardson met with Darfur Peace Agreement 
(DPA) non-signatory rebels, representatives of the Sudanese 
Liberation Movement (SLM/MM) faction of Minni Minawi, and the 
African Union (AU) Force Commander.  Richardson gained the 
commitment of non-signatory rebels to a 60-day ceasefire, during 
which AU/UN efforts to jump-start a political process aimed at 
achieving a lasting peace settlement could be launched. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In his meeting with SLM/MM commanders in Nyala, Richardson 
cited disturbing reports of violence against humanitarians by SLM/MM 
rebels, and pressed for immediate action to stop such attacks and 
bring those culpable to justice.  Though defensive about the African 
Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) failure to conduct even rudimentary 
firewood patrols, the AU Force Commander nonetheless welcomed the 
forthcoming support of the UN, which will give his beleaguered force 
the transportation, communications, and material to "dominate the 
ground."  Richardson also conducted courtesy calls on the Deputy 
governors of both North and South Darfur, received a briefing by UN 
officials, and visited Al-Salaam camp in El Fasher, home to 43,000 
internally displaced persons (IDPs). Enf summary.QQ
