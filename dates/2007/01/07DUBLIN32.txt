(SBU) The Irish Government is in a position to pledge funds 
to Lebanon at the January 25 Conference in Paris, but has not 
yet determined an amount, according to Dermot McGauran, 
Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) Deputy Director for the 
Middle East and North Africa, to whom Pol/Econ Chief 
delivered reftel demarche on January 12.  McGauran noted that 
a Paris pledge would add to the euro 1.5 million that Ireland 
had provided to Lebanon in 2006 through various channels.  He 
added that the Irish Government would most likely send a 
representative to the Paris conference, but had not decided 
who.  McGauran emphasized that Irish involvement in Lebanon 
stretched back to 1978, when Irish troops took part in the 
original UNIFIL mission.  Between 1980 and 2001, 47 Irish 
soldiers died in the course of UNIFIL service, he recounted. 
He also pointed out that there were now 150 Irish soldiers in 
the reconstituted UNIFIL force, as part of a Finnish-Irish 
battalion.  This latest troop contribution, McGauran said, 
embodied Ireland's continuing commitment to Lebanon.
