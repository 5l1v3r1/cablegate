SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION - MERCOSUR SUMMIT IN RIO 
 
On January 21, conservative, independent "La Tercera" (circ. 
101,000) carried an opinion column by journalist and former diplomat 
Jose Rodriguez Elizondo entitled "Mercosur: Histrionics and 
Strategy."  Quote: 
 
"One could say that Chavez' strategy is antithetical to Bolivar's 
dream of integration, but we cannot deny that it does exist. On the 
contrary, the rest of the region has focused on the dilemma of 
whether it is good or bad that after 9/11 the White House has 
eliminated us from its agenda.  Instead of integrationist actions, 
we are like those dumb hares [in a fable] discussing whether their 
chasers are greyhounds or bloodhounds."
