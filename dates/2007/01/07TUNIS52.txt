¶1. (SBU) In a meeting with MFA Director General Hatem Atallah 
on December 28, Charge presented new USG initiatives to 
support human rights defenders (refs A and B).  Atallah 
replied that the MFA would read over the new initiatives 
carefully.  He acknowledged that the USG and Tunisia had 
different perspectives on the issue of NGOs.  Charge 
mentioned recent crackdowns on NGOs and harassment of NGO 
activists by the GOT (ref C), and emphasized that the USG is 
opposed to any restrictions on freedom of association and 
assembly.  Atallah said it is the policy of the GOT that NGOs 
have a role to play, not just in development and social 
areas, but also in the political sphere.  He said there was 
"no problem" as long as NGOs are in compliance with relevant 
Tunisian law guiding the funding and activity of 
associations.  NOTE: On December 23, the MFA sent a dipnote 
to all diplomatic missions reminding them of relevant law 
pertaining to funding of NGOs.  END NOTE. 
 
¶2. (U) Post distributed a press release on the new 
initiatives which has also been forwarded to relevant NGO 
contacts.  Post will continue to look for opportunities to 
highlight and implement these new initiatives.
