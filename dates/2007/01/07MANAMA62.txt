Embassy Manama nominates Political Assistant Salman Hubail to 
participate in Political Training for FSN Staff, scheduled 
for April 2-13, 2007.  Per Ref A, below is the requested 
information for Mr. Hubail. 
 
A)  Name: Salman Abdul Wahab Hubail 
 
B)  Grade: 10/4 
 
C)  Length of service: 16 months (started October 2005) 
 
D)  English language ability: 4 spoken, 4 reading (estimated 
from FSI scale descriptions) 
 
E)  Time spent in the U.S.: none 
 
F)  Previous training in the U.S.: none 
 
G)  Nominated for political training course previously? Yes, 
February 2006 (Ref B) 
 
H)  Why training needed/how skills used: Mr. Hubail will 
benefit greatly from the course topics outlined in para 4 of 
Ref A.  As our sole political assistant, Mr. Hubail is called 
upon to perform a wide range of duties, including nearly all 
those presented in Ref A, such as drafting cable text, 
interviewing contacts, briefing Front Office and political 
section colleagues, working with contacts in the Department, 
interpreting newsworthy items daily, and close involvement in 
VIP visits.  Since Mr. Hubail is fairly new to the Embassy, 
it is also very important for him to learn more about State 
Department culture and practices so that he can meet and 
exceed his job requirements and manage his portfolio 
effectively. 
 
I)  Skill-sharing at post: Mr. Hubail works closely with 
post's economic and commercial FSNs and has regular contact 
with FSNs in Public Affairs.  He has learned much from them 
in his first year on the job, and he will have opportunities 
to share his experiences and learning with them after 
returning from the training.  The training will be especially 
useful in the crossover area of politics and economics.  In 
Bahrain social and political issues have direct links with 
and effects on economic and commercial activities.
