¶1.  Post supports OPIC's planned investment in Paladin Realty LP 
Fund, which will assist in the development of affordable and 
middle-income housing in Brazil (reftel).  Recent changes to 
Brazilian legislation have encouraged substantial growth in the real 
estate and construction sector.  These changes have brought new 
financing to the sector and have allowed significant recent 
issuances of mortgage-backed securities.  This high growth comes 
from a relatively low base, however, so there is still need for 
additional capital.  Moroever, given Brazil's modest domestic 
savings rate and its overall investment needs, there clearly is a 
useful role for external financing to play in supplementing domestic 
funding sources. 
 
¶2. Paladin is not very well known in the Brazilian real estate and 
construction sector, although representatives of its local partner, 
Even Construtora, spoke very highly of them to us.  An independent 
real estate industry group with whom we spoke had no knowledge of 
Paladin, but noted that Even Construtora is a well-regarded market 
leader in the Brazilian real estate and construction sector.
