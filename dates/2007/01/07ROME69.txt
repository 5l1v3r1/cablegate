Classified By: Ambassador Ronald P. Spogli for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1.  (U)  This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 5. 
 
¶2.  (S/NF) Summary.  Eni CEO Paolo Scaroni told the 
Ambassador that the Iranian Energy Minister has offered Eni 
investment opportunities in Iran's South Pars and Azadegan 
oil fields.  Scaroni said Eni is interested in additional 
investment in Iran so long as there are no multilateral 
sanctions against Iran in effect, Iran pays money owed Eni 
under existing contracts, and the investments are structured 
so that Eni's return is based on world oil and gas prices. 
The Ambassador made clear USG opposition to any investment 
that supports the current Iranian government.  Scaroni will 
be in Washington February four and five and is willing to 
meet with Washington officials to discuss Eni's interest in 
Iran.  End Summary. 
 
¶3. (S/NF) Paolo Scaroni, CEO of Eni, the oil and gas 
parastatal 30 percent owned by the GOI, met with the 
Ambassador January 9 to discuss possible additional Eni 
investments in Iran.  Scaroni said that during a meeting on 
the margins of an OPEC conference, the Iranian Energy 
Minister offered Eni investment opportunities in the South 
Pars and Azadegan oil fields.  (Note:  As reported ref C, Eni 
has invested 2.5 billion dollars in Iran since the 1950's, 
and has a 60 percent interest in phases four and five of the 
South Pars gas field.  End note.)  Scaroni said he told the 
Energy Minister Eni would be interested in additional 
investment in Iran if (i) Eni is paid the "hundreds of 
millions" owed it by the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) 
under existing contracts, (ii) the investments are structured 
so that Eni's return would be based on world oil/gas prices, 
not a set amount per unit produced; and (iii) no 
international sanctions against Iran are in place. 
 
¶4. (S/NF) Scaroni said he has briefed PM Prodi and FM D'Alema 
on Iran's offer, adding that Eni wants to be transparent and 
open with the USG as it considers the Iranian offer.  He 
noted that Iran is the only viable alternative to Russia for 
meeting Europe's natural gas needs.  The Ambassador told 
Scaroni that the USG opposes commercial activities with Iran 
that strengthen the regime's hand.  Scaroni mentioned that he 
would be in Washington February 4-5 to participate in an 
Aspen Institute forum on energy and energy security and 
agreed with the Ambassador's suggestion that he should meet 
with USG officials to discuss Iran's proposal to Eni 
 
¶5. (S/NF) Comment and action request.  Scaroni's February 
trip to Washington provides us with an excellent opportunity 
to make clear to Eni the consequences of pursuing additional 
investments in Iran's energy sector.  Action request:  Post 
requests Department guidance on the availability of senior 
USG officials to meet with Scaroni on February four or five. 
Embassy POC for coordination with Scaroni's office is Energy 
Officer David Whiting XXXXXXXXXXXX End comment 
and action requested.
