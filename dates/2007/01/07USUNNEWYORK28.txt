SUBJECT: SECURITY COUNCIL AUTHORIZES ADVANCE MISSION TO 
CHAD AND CAR 
 
 
¶1. (U) On January 16 the United Nations Security Council 
unanimously adopted a Presidential Statement (PRST) 
requesting the Secretary-General to deploy an advance mission 
to Chad and the Central African Republic to lay the political 
groundwork for an eventual multidimensional UN presence in 
those countries.  The final text, contained in Paragraph 2, 
was agreed after the Chinese delegation conceded to deletion 
of a phrase that suggested the incoming peacekeeping force 
could act only with the consent of the Chadian and CAR 
governments.  The PRST was adopted as UN document 
S/PRST/2007/2. 
 
¶2. (U) Begin PRST text: 
 
The Security Council reiterates its concern about the 
continuing instability along the borders between the Sudan, 
Chad and the Central African Republic and about the threat 
which this poses to the safety of the civilian population and 
the conduct of humanitarian operations. 
 
The Security Council takes note of the Secretary-General's 
report of 22 December 2006 (S/2006/1019), which contains 
preliminary recommendations on the deployment of a 
multidimensional  United Nations presence in eastern Chad and 
north-eastern Central African Republic.  It notes the 
position taken by the Central African and Chadian authorities 
in favour in principle of such a presence and looks forward 
to their continued engagement in preparing for it. 
 
The Security Council notes the Secretary-General's intention 
to authorize the immediate return of the technical assessment 
mission to the region in order to complete its observations 
that were curtailed on security grounds and requests him to 
submit, by the middle of February 2007, updated and finalized 
recommendations on the size, structure and mandate of a UN 
multidimensional presence. 
 
To accelerate preparations for an early decision on the 
possible deployment of a multidimensional UN presence, the 
Security Council requests the Secretary-General deploy as 
soon as possible an advance mission to Chad and the Central 
African Republic, in consultation with their Governments, as 
envisaged in paragraph 88 of his report. 
 
¶3. (U) End PRST text.
