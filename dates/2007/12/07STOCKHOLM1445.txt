¶1. Summary: Deputy Economic Counselor met with 
Ambassador/Director General Andreas Ekman and Ladan Moghaddas 
at the Swedish Inspectorate of Strategic Products (ISP) 
November 29, 2007.  Ekman commented that after the Government 
of Sweden (GOS) notified the UNSCR 1737 Sanctions Committee 
on November 9, 2007 of the intention to authorize payment of 
contracts entered into prior to Bank Sepah's listing in Annex 
I of UNSCR 1747, the Sanctions Committee contacted ISP and 
requested more-detailed information about the nature of the 
transactions, the parties involved and the manner in which 
the unfrozen funds would be used.  Ekman assured Econoff that 
no payments had been authorized or made as of November 29.

¶4. Comment: Ekman and Moghaddas emphasized the importance of 
closely monitoring financial transactions with Iran, assuring 
Econoff that the GOS utilizes the same safeguards employed by 
Great Britain to comply with Financial Action Task Force 
(FATF) guidance.  Ekman also opined that the European Union 
(EU) was moving "far too slowly" in drafting new legislation 
to cover brokering, which is not prohibited under existing EU 
and Swedish laws, and hinted that the GOS might move 
unilaterally in 2008 to introduce new Swedish legislation. 
Post will continue to monitor the situation and report 
additional conversations with the ISP septel.
