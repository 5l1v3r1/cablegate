SUBJECT: SPAIN/ETA: RARE POLITICAL UNITY IN WAKE OF ETA 
ASSASSINATION 
 
¶1. (U)  Spanish political leaders from virtually every stripe 
have presented a united front in the aftermath of the 
December 1 shooting in the French town of Capbreton that left 
one Spanish Civil Guard officer dead and another in a coma. 
The officers, part of a bilateral counterterrorism initiative 
conducting joint operations with French security forces 
against ETA leadership, were shot after they had exited a 
cafe.  The victims were reportedly out of uniform and 
unarmed.  This is the first killing of a Spanish Civil Guard 
member by ETA since December 2002, and brings to 206 the 
total number of Guards killed by ETA during their almost 
40-year terrorist campaign against the Spanish government. 
This murder also marks the first assassination by ETA in 
France since 1976.  The assailants, described in press 
reports as two men and a woman, fled the scene in one vehicle 
but later carjacked another at gunpoint, briefly kidnapping a 
woman and her daughter.  The suspects are still at large, and 
French and Spanish authorities found material in the first 
car that leads them to believe ETA members were preparing a 
terrorist attack to coincide with the December 6 holiday 
commemorating the Spanish Constitution. 
 
¶2. (U)  All Spanish political parties, except Basque National 
Action (ANV) and Batasuna who have ties to ETA, met in an 
extraordinary session of Congress later in the day to sign a 
joint declaration condemning the attack and expressing 
support to security forces in the fight against terrorism. 
They called for a demonstration to take place in Madrid on 
December 4 under the motto "For Freedom and the Defeat of 
ETA."  This is the first time since the Madrid train bombings 
of March 11, 2004 that Spain's two main political parties, 
the ruling Socialist government of President Zapatero and the 
main opposition Partido Popular (PP), will appear together in 
a public event denouncing ETA terrorism, and PP leader 
Mariano Rajoy offered his party's full support to President 
Zapatero.  The Spanish government announced on December 2 
that it would not allow ANV to participate in the March 
national elections because of suspicions that it supports ETA 
terrorism. 
 
¶3. (U) The slain Civil Guard officer was identified as Raul 
Centeno, 24, and his partner Fernando Trapero, 23, is in a 
coma and has been declared brain dead.  An emotional state 
funeral for Centeno took place on December 2 and was attended 
by the Spanish Royal Family, President Zapatero, GOS 
ministers, and members of the diplomatic community. 
 
//COMMENT// 
 
¶4. (SBU) The murder of officer Centeno is certainly tragic, 
but our contacts in the Spanish Ministry of Interior tell us 
this event does not appear to have been premeditated and was 
most likely the result of a chance encounter.  French and 
Spanish CT cooperation has greatly increased over the past 
few years and ETA members operating in France have very 
little room to maneuver.  However, this attack and the 
suspects' ability to remain at large a few days after the 
shooting shows that at least some ETA members remain active 
on French soil.  We believe this weekend's events will lead 
to even better cooperation and more joint operations. 
Spanish political parties have shown a rare degree of unity 
that probably will not hold during the intense political 
campaign expected in advance of national elections on March 
¶9.  The Zapatero government appears close to de-legalizing 
ANV, a step the PP has demanded Zapatero take for many 
months, and probably will time the official announcement for 
maximum political gain and to take the wind out of PP charges 
that Zapatero has been soft on ETA terrorism.
