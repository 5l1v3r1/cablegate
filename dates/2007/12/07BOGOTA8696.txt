¶1.  In response to reftels A and B Econoff initiated efforts 
with MilGroup Army Officer to confirm the purchase by the 
Colombian Army (COLAR) of 28 power supply units from Israel. 
After receipt of reftel C, Econoff understood that the items 
referenced in reftel A had been incorporated into nine 
computer display units (CDUs), and that these CDUs were then 
incorporated into nine 155 millimeter howitzers by General 
Dynamics/Santa Barbara of Spain (GD). 
 
¶2.  On November 8, Econoff and MilGroup Army Officer met with 
Lt. Albino of the Administrative Section of the Armaments 
Division of the COLAR to determine if the COLAR had purchased 
nine 155 millimeter howitzers from GD.  Lt. Albino confirmed 
that the COLAR had purchased nine 155 millimeter howitzers 
(delivered in September 2007) that were in use by the COLAR. 
However, Lt. Albino was unable to confirm who had sold the 
weapons to the COLAR. 
 
¶3.  On November 27 and December 21 Col. Jairo Alfonso Aponte 
Preito, head of COLAR logistics, provided MilGroup Army 
Officer with additional information, including the contract 
for the nine 155 millimeter howitzers.  The contract was 
between the COLAR, MLM International Corporation of the USA 
(MLM) and Brackley Consulting and Finance Services of 
Colombia (Brackley). 
 
¶4.  On December 27 Econoff contacted Brackley to determine if 
the nine 155 millimeter howitzers were originally from GD. 
Brackley legal representative Alberto Esguerra Gouffray 
stated that Brackley had been acting as a sales 
representative for MLM in the sale of the nine 155 millimeter 
howitzers.  Gouffray further stated that while he understood 
that nine 155 millimeter howitzers were manufactured by GD, 
Brackley did not have a direct contract with GD. 
 
¶5.  On December 28 Econoff contacted MLM to verify whether 
the nine 155 millimeter howitzers the COLAR purchased were 
from GD.  MLM Sales Director Robert G. Suber confirmed that 
the nine 155 millimeter howitzers sold to the COLAR were from 
GD.
