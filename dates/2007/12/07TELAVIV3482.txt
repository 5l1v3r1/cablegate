MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
JERUSALEM 
 
 
NOTE 
 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the State of Israel 
presents its compliments to Her Majesty's Embassy and has the 
honour to refer to its Note Verbale, No. 106/2007 dated 19 
October 2007 concerning the Shepherd's Hotel. 
 
The Ministry reiterates its understanding that no planning 
application regarding the construction of a new complex on 
the site has been submitted.  All such applications are 
publicly available and, as noted in the Ministry's response 
to the British Non-Paper on this matter dated 1 May 2007, any 
such application would be examined in accordance with the 
provisions of Israeli Law. 
 
As regard the Mufti's Grove site, we understand from the 
Israel Lands Authority that the declaration issued in 
relation to this site was not a new procedure, but in fact 
the continuation of a proceeding which has been in process 
for several decades.  We are also informed that this site has 
been and remains designated as public open space.  The site 
is currently the subject of a petition to the Supreme Court 
sitting as the High Court of Justice HCJ 6716/07. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs avails itself of this 
opportunity to renew to Her Britannic Majesty's Embassy the 
assurances of its highest consideration. 
 
 
 
Jerusalem, 28 October 2007
