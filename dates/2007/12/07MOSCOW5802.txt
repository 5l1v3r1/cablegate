SUBJECT: SHARING DRAFT IRAQ UNSCR TEXT WITH RUSSIA 
 
REF: STATE 165490 
 
¶1. (SBU) Poloff and UK Emboff jointly delivered draft Iraq 
UNSCR text and reftel points to MFA Counselor for 
International Organizations Yuriy Rudakov on December 13. 
Rudakov said that the MFA had received a copy of the draft 
from the Russian Mission in New York, and that the GOR had no 
major objections to the text.  He offered, unofficially, that 
the GOR would approve the resolution with some modifications. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Rudakov said the GOR appreciated that the draft 
UNSCR extended the mandate of the Multinational Force-Iraq 
for only twelve months, which presented a timeframe for 
ending the current multilateral framework.  He expressed 
strong Russian support for U.S. efforts in Iraq, while 
reiterating that the GOR considered it important to establish 
a timeframe for withdrawing Coalition Forces.  Rudakov argued 
that Iraqis currently feel that they live under occupation, 
which hindered attempts to end factional fighting.  He 
reiterated GOR arguments that a timeframe for withdrawing 
foreign troops could change the attitude of Iraqis and help 
foster national reconciliation.
