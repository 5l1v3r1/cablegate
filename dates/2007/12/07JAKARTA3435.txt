¶1.  (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- Please 
handle accordingly. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Assistant Secretaries:  As you are well aware, the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC) talks recently concluded in Bali, Indonesia on 
December 15 with the "Bali Roadmap."  While the USG spent 
considerable time and energy supporting the overall 
negotiations, Mission also sought to leverage the presence of 
so many Congressional visitors in Bali to call attention to 
the extraordinary importance and depth of our bilateral 
relationship with Indonesia.  Our visitors were very 
receptive to this message and I believe there is substantial 
room for follow-on dialogue about Indonesia in Washington.  A 
full list of the Congressional participants that attended the 
UNFCCC talks in Bali is included in paragraph 8. 
 
¶3. (SBU) As reported in Refs A and B, Senator Kerry and 
Representative Faleomavaega demonstrated considerable 
enthusiasm for our message about the importance of Indonesia. 
 Senator Kerry and Representative Faleomavaega would both 
likely welcome periodic updates on the relationship, as well 
as suggestions on how they could help deepen bilateral 
engagement. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In addition, a total of roughly 40 staffers from the 
Senate and House traveled to Bali to attend the UNFCCC talks. 
 Mission briefed the staffers on Indonesia's status as an 
"environmental super-power" in terms of its bio-diversity and 
the extent of its natural resources, while underscoring the 
alarming rate of degradation taking place.  I also had 
occasion to brief our Congressional visitors on USG efforts 
to define a "strategic center" to U.S.-Indonesian relations. 
This "strategic center" would encompass three areas:  1. 
Reform--How does the U.S. support the massive reform efforts 
underway in Indonesia?  2. Security--How do we develop a 
stronger relationship with both the police and the military? 
¶3. Connections--How do we encourage Indonesia to open up to 
the outside world? 
 
¶5. (SBU) During the course of the two week UNFCCC talks, it 
became readily apparent that there is a considerable appetite 
for greater dialogue about Indonesia in the U.S. Congress.  I 
will cite just a few of the numerous examples.  Margaret 
Cummisky from Senator Inouye's staff told Mission that 
Senator Inouye believes Indonesia "deserves more attention 
than it gets."  Ms. Cummisky demonstrated great interest in 
Indonesia herself and would like to identify ways to help 
advance the relationship.  Jim Greene from Senator Biden's 
staff characterized the environmental briefing he received on 
Indonesia as "the highlight of his trip," and underscored the 
fact that Senator Biden tracks Indonesian affairs very 
closely.  Greene went out of his way to meet with Acehenese 
Governor Irwandi in Bali and noted that Senator Biden follows 
the Aceh reconstruction issue in detail.  Greene also 
mentioned that Senator Biden would like to find ways to help 
the decentralization efforts in Aceh and Papua move forward. 
Richard Frandsen from the Energy and Commerce Committee also 
expressed great appreciation for a Mission briefing he 
received on avian influenza. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Throughout the Bali conference, I was continually 
struck by the palpable enthusiasm and interest in Indonesian 
affairs shown by our Congressional visitors.  The United 
States has a remarkable opportunity to help this country of 
over 240 million people secure a bright future, while 
building the foundation for a long-term partnership in a 
strategic corner of the world.  We believe the Congressional 
visitors that attended the UNFCCC talks share this vision for 
our relationship with Indonesia and will be receptive to 
further engagement with the Department as we look for ways to 
move forward USG legislative priorities for Indonesia. 
 
¶7. (U) Mission would be pleased to provide additional 
information and looks forward to assisting in ongoing 
contacts with key interlocutors.  Regards, Cameron.
