SUBJECT: LEAHY VETTING REQUEST: ANP RANK REFORM AFGHAN NATIONAL 
CIVIL ORDER POLICE 
 
 
¶1. This is an action request; please see paragraphs 2 and 3. 
 
¶2. In order to comply with Leahy vetting requirements, this cable 
forwards the names and biodata of 17 Afghan National Police (ANP) 
field grade officers selected for positions in the Afghan National 
Civil Order Police.  When there are individuals with one name, Post 
has made a good faith effort to ensure that these individuals 
actually only have one name. 
 
¶3. IMPORTANT NOTE:  The international community has approved pay 
increases for ANP company grade officers (captains and lieutenants); 
however, pay increases for the field grade ANP personnel will not be 
approved until completion of Rank Reform.  Currently, ANP field 
grade personnel earn less than their Afghan National Army (ANA) 
equivalents, a situation that is causing severe morale problems. 
Completion of the ANP Rank Reform process will significantly 
alleviate deteriorating morale, which is why Post requests the 
Department's expedited vetting and response at the earliest possible 
date.  Post greatly appreciates Department's strong support for 
completing the ANP Rank Reform process.
