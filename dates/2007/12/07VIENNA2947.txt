Introduction and Summary 
------------------------ 
1.(U) A delegation of Iranian parliamentarians visited Vienna 
December 11-14 upon the invitation of the Austria-Iran parliamentary 
group.  In meetings with the delegation, Parliamentary President 
Prammer (SPO) and Foreign Policy Committee Chairman Schieder (SPO) 
criticized Iran's human rights record, called for Iran to comply 
with UN resolutions on its nuclear program, and expressed hope for 
Iran's support of the Annapolis peace process.  End Introduction and 
Summary. 
 
The Visit 
--------- 
2.(SBU)  OVP MP Helmut Kukacka, head of the Austria-Iran 
parliamentary group, organized the visit together with the 
International Office of Parliament.  The delegation consisted of six 
MPs headed by Mohammad Bagher Bahrami.  The Iranian MPs' visit was a 
follow-up to a visit by Austrian Parliamentary President Werner 
Fasslabend to Iran two years ago.  The delegation met with with 
Austrian MPs from all parties, as well as the First and Second 
President of Parliament. 
 
Meeting with MPs 
---------------- 
3.(U)  Discussions on December 11 with lawmakers from OVP and the 
opposition rightwing FPO and Greens focused on exploring 
possibilities for the expansion of bilateral economic relations. 
Kukacka particularly stressed the great interest of Austrian 
companies in engaging in business with Iran.  He welcomed the 
"Iranian political program as the basis for a liberalization of the 
economy."  While the other Austrian MPs emphasized that a 
rapprochement between the EU and Iran on the question of the Iranian 
nuclear program had to be reached, FPO MP Heinz Christian Strache 
noted Iran's right to have a civilian nuclear program.  Even the CIA 
had now admitted that the Iranian nuclear program was peaceful, 
added Strache. 
 
Parliamentary President Prammer 
------------------------------- 
4.(U)  First Parliamentary President Prammer stressed in her 
conversation with the delegation that Iran's compliance with the UN 
resolutions on the Iranian nuclear program was essential.  She also 
warned that human rights and human dignity must be respected, and 
that the Holocaust must not be denied anywhere in the world.  At the 
conclusion of the meeting Prammer noted that, despite the 
constructive climate of the encounter, marked differences of opinion 
remained. 
 
Foreign Policy Committee Chairman Schieder 
------------------------------------------ 
5.(U)  Along the same lines, Foreign Policy Committee Chairman 
Schieder raised Iranian President Ahmadinejad's Holocaust denial, 
the Iranian human rights situation, and the importance of EU-Iranian 
dialogue on the Iranian nuclear program at the meeting with the 
delegation.  Schieder also expressed the hope that Iran would 
support the Annapolis peace process and would recognize Israel's 
right to existence. 
 
Comment 
------- 
6.(SBU)  The visit was largely a formal occasion, with some 
opportunity to generally explore possibilities for expanded economic 
relations.  The SPO parliamentary representatives, in particular, 
also voiced vehement criticism of the Iranian human rights record 
and non-compliance with UN resolutions on their nuclear program.
