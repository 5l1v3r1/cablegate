Turkish CHOD Delivers Remarks at War Academies 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶1. In the keynote speech delivered at the opening of the Turkish War 
Academies on Oct. 1, CHOD GEN Yasar Buyukanit underlined the theme 
that no power can divide Turkey, change its secular structure, or 
shake the Turkish nation's confidence in its military.  Emphasizing 
the importance of the fight against terrorism, GEN Buyukanit said 
actions, not words, are what counts.  He also noted that Iraq was 
moving towards a federal structure and that this posed risks for 
Turkey. 
 
Anti-Terrorism High Council Convenes 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶2. The Anti-Terrorism High Council convened under PM Tayyip Erdogan 
on October 9.  A statement released following the meeting noted that 
the Council discussed recent terrorist attacks and reaffirmed 
Turkey's determination in fight against terrorism.  The statement 
further indicated that necessary orders and instruments were given 
to authorities in order to take all legal, political and economic 
measures to end the presence of the terrorist organization in the 
neighboring country. 
 
TGS Reacts to House's Armenian Genocide Resolution 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
¶3. Turkish CHOD GEN Yasar Buyukanit sent a letter to his 
counterpart, Chairman of the Joint chiefs of Staff, ADM Mullen, on 
Oct. 9 noting that if the resolution is adopted it would cause 
serious problems in US-Turkish relations.  GEN Buyukanit, in Rome on 
an official visit on Oct. 18, told the press that if the resolution 
should be adopted by the full House, Turkey-US military ties will 
"never be the same."  "But I hope it will not pass, and our ties 
with the US will be better," Buyukanit said.  Later on Oct. 30, 
Turkish General Staff (TGS) posted a 34-page report on the events of 
1915 on its website.  The report, entitled "Issues Missed in the 
1915 Armenian Debate," was prepared by the TGS's research center 
Strategic Research Study Center (SAREM).

¶8. Turkey's Supreme Military Council  (YAS) convened under PM Tayyip

them for engaging in Islamic fundamentalist activities.  PM Erdogan 
and defense Minister Vecdi Gonul, the only civilian members of the
