SUBJECT: INSTRUCTION FOR ICTY/ICTR DEBATE 
 
¶1. The Department instructs USUN to draw on the following 
points for use during the Security Council,s December 10 
debate on the Completion Strategies for the International 
Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda (ICTY 
and ICTR). 
 
¶2. Begin Points: 
 
The United States welcomes the assessments of the Prosecutors 
and Presidents from both Tribunals and their progress to date 
on Completion Strategy implementation.  The United States 
notes with appreciation the efforts of Prosecutor Carla Del 
Ponte and her team, particularly Deputy Prosecutor David 
Tolbert, in forcefully championing accountability and 
effectively managing an efficient and successful 
Prosecutor,s office.  The arrival of incoming Prosecutor 
Serge Brammertz will ensure that this tradition of excellence 
continues.  We also applaud the judges as well as the 
hundreds of staff members who, on a daily basis, dedicate 
their energy and skills to the lasting success and legacy of 
both these Tribunals. 
 
As the Tribunals move toward closure, they must maintain 
their current levels of efficiency.  The United States is 
encouraged by the current pace of trials and by the 
determination of all Tribunal organs to complete trials as 
soon after 2008 as is feasible by expediting proceedings, as 
outlined in their assessments. 
 
The work of the Tribunals in countering impunity will not be 
complete, however, without the resolution of the fate of the 
remaining fugitives and the consolidation of each Tribunal,s 
legacy. 
 
Nearly twenty fugitives from the ICTY and the ICTR remain 
at-large.  The United States calls on all States to fulfill 
their legal obligations to cooperate fully with the Tribunals. 
 
For the ICTY, Serbia, in particular, must take further steps 
to fulfill its obligations, especially through the 
apprehension and transfer of all fugitives who may be on 
Serbian territory, including Ratko Mladic and Radovan 
Karadzic.  We welcome the improved cooperation of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina,s federal and entity authorities with the ICTY. 
We are also encouraged by ongoing efforts of the governments 
of the Western Balkans to share information and evidence to 
further domestic prosecutions of war crimes cases.  We call 
on these countries to enhance their cooperation in the 
future.  As Prosecutor Del Ponte reports, regional 
cooperation remains crucial in apprehending and bringing to 
justice the remaining fugitives. 
 
Concrete action is also needed from The Democratic Republic 
of the Congo and Kenya to apprehend and transfer all ICTR 
fugitives within their borders.  Evidence continues to mount 
that top fugitive and alleged genocide financier, Felicien 
Kabuga, remains in Kenya.  As Security Council pressure 
mounts for the ICTR,s successful completion, Kenya must 
fully cooperate with the ICTR in apprehending Kabuga. 
 
The United States welcomes the November 9 Agreement between 
the Congolese and Rwandan governments for dismantling the 
ex-FAR/Interahamwe forces still active in the eastern DRC. 
We have every confidence that any ICTR fugitive captured 
during this campaign will be turned over for prosecution. 
 
Mladic, Karadzic, Kabuga, and others are charged with 
horrific crimes and it is unthinkable that they would escape 
international justice.  They must be immediately captured and 
prosecuted. 
 
The United States commends the ongoing work of the Tribunals 
to ensure a lasting positive legacy.  Their promotion of 
domestic capacity within the countries of the former 
Yugoslavia and Rwanda is central to this legacy.  With four 
ICTR cases currently pending possible transfer to Rwanda, it 
is imperative that Rwanda,s work to improve its judicial 
system be supported.   An enduring legacy also requires that 
each Tribunals, residual issues be addressed meticulously 
and pragmatically.  The United States will work diligently to 
ensure these efforts are successful. 
 
We again thank the Presidents, Prosecutors, and Registrars 
for their service to the Tribunals, to justice and 
accountability, and to the people who gave rise and purpose 
to these institutions ) the victims.
