Panama Continues to Watch Iran Closely 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶1. (C) "Panama continues to watch the Iran situation 
closely," First VP and FM Samuel Lewis told Ambassador in 
response to presentation of reftel A demarche.  Lewis 
indicated that he understood that the U.S. Iran policy had 
not changed.  MFA Senior Advisor for UN Security Council 
Affairs Nils Castro thanked Ambassador for facilitating a 
briefing by a State expert on Iran's nuclear programs (reftel 
B); "His briefing was a real education and helped us to 
understand the gravity of the Iran situation."

¶2.  (C)  Post does not sense any shift in Panama's position 
since Ambassador's December 3 delivery of reftel D demarche, 
reported in reftel C.  Ultimately, Panama's comfort level on 
dealing with Iran in the UNSC will be highest if there is a 
broad consensus in support of a Chapter VII resolution.
