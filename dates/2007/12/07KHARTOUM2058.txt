¶1. (SBU) Summary: Chinese Defense Attache told poloff December 24 
that Chinese engineers have not started construction on the Nyala 
supercamp and are still waiting for AMIS escort of heavy 
construction equipment (Ref A) which arrived in Sudan November 10. 
Dong said he was comfortable with the progress on the SOFA and said 
he had been assured by UNAMID that AMIS/UNAMID force protection 
would be improved with the transition.  He opined that the 
elimination of the MSA is good, and was unaware that starting 
January 1 many of the operations and maintenance duties now 
performed by PAE at AMIS camps would be the responsibility of 
UNAMID. End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Chinese Defense Attache Colonel Dong Jian Dong told poloff 
on December 24 that as of December 23 the 140 Chinese engineers in 
Nyala have not started construction of the engineer's tent housing 
due to the delay of heavy construction equipment and therefore have 
not started construction of the Nyala supercamp.  He said that half 
of the engineer's heavy equipment remains 120 kilometers from Nyala 
waiting for an AMIS protective convoy to escort it to Nyala.  He 
said that he has asked AMIS to provide a reason for the delay but 
has not received a reply.  Dong added that the rest of heavy 
equipment, which arrived in Khartoum on November 10, is still 
"enroute" to Nyala but he had no estimated date for its arrival. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Dong said that without the heavy equipment the Chinese are 
unable to clear the ground to erect tents to house the 315 Chinese 
engineers. For the time being, Dong said the first tranche of 
Chinese engineers are housed at AMIS' Forward Operating Base (FOB). 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Chinese estimate that it will take two to three weeks 
to construct the housing for the Chinese engineers once the heavy 
equipment arrives, but completion would be subject to arrival of 
additional supplies and materials from China.  He said that these 
items left China roughly December 14 and should arrive in Port Sudan 
perhaps as early as January 3.  However, Dong repeated earlier 
concerns that customs delays and transport problems from Port Sudan 
to Nyala will push this date back considerably, and hence will 
further delay construction of the supercamp. 
 
SOFA AND FORCE PROTECTION 
------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Regarding the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) for UNAMID, 
Dong said he felt "comfortable" with the progress he had seen.  He 
said that because Chinese soldiers had no contact with Sudanese, 
there is little need for a SOFA, and added that he had the 
assurances of the GOS that Chinese soldiers had the status of 
"diplomats."  As for force protection of his engineers, he said that 
AMIS patrols regularly but "not aggressively."  Dong said he visited 
Darfur on December 20 and that UNAMID Chief of Staff Patrick 
Davidson-Houston assured him that once the transition occurred, 
African troops under UNAMID command would increase their patrols. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Regarding the recent Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) 
attack on Chinese-owned oil facilities in Kordofan, Dong said that 
this was not a JEM attack but the work of "bandits."  He said that 
JEM had been associated with the attack only because JEM, for 
propaganda purposes, had claimed responsibility.  He said that the 
SAF had captured most of the attackers who turned out to have 
historic but very old links to the JEM. 
 
STOPPING THE MSA 
---------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Dong opined that UNAMID's plan to stop paying the Mission 
Subsistence Allowance (MSA) to rebel representatives is a good idea. 
 He totally discounted the idea that the MSA payments increased 
security for AMIS troops and countered that enabling rebel 
representatives to have free access to AMIS camps reduced security. 
 
UNAMID TRANSITION 
----------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) Dong was unaware that beginning January 1 operations and 
maintenance (O&M) functions such as sewage treatment operations and 
electrical generator maintenance currently performed by PAE would be 
turned over to UNAMID, which intends to provide these services 
through local contracts. Asked if the Chinese engineers had any 
plans to assist in the transition of O&M, Dong said it was 
"unimaginable" for UNAMID to change support contractors at such a 
sensitive time.

¶9. (SBU) Comment: The on-going delays in deploying the Chinese 
engineering unit track with other reports from El Fasher (Ref D). 
Lack of progress on the supercamp poses a problem for UNAMID, which 
will not be able to absorb additional troops until the camp is 
completed.  The Chinese Embassy, whose primary concern is the 
security of their troops, does not appear particularly perturbed by 
the lengthy delays in deployment.
