¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: During the recent Muslim celebration Ied 
Adha and Christmas holiday season, Surabaya police 
conducted two anti trafficking operations resulting in the 
arrest of seven suspects for attempting to traffic six 
children and two women into debt prostitution bondage and 
smuggling from Indonesia to Malaysia.  The victims were 
handed over to an International Organization of Migration 
(IOM)-sponsored NGO for repatriation.  The Surabaya 
parliament and Surabaya People Empowerment Board (Bapemas) 
provided funding and helped with the victims' repatriation. 
These arrests and subsequent repatriations are the 
continued result of US counter-trafficking support for 
Indonesia on four key fronts: DOJ-legislative, RSO- 
investigative, IOM-supportive, and ICITAP-training.   These 
arrests continue to demonstrate excellent coordination and 
positive relationships between these US Government agencies 
and Host Government Officials. End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Acting on information provided initially by 
local NGO's to ConGen Surabaya RSO, local authorities 
initiated investigations into suspected suppliers of women 
and children for sex tourism in known prostitution areas of 
Surabaya infamously known as Dolly and Jarak.  On December 
18 and 20, police conducted raids and arrested seven 
suspects, Heriyanto, Abdul Kadir Karim, Suwardi, 
Nurlailiyah, Hoo Tjoe Liong, Kusdaryanti, and Sumirah. 
Under interrogation, the traffickers described an intricate 
smuggling network originating in Surabaya, thru Tarakan, 
Kalimantan and into Sabah province of Malaysia.  All seven 
SUBJECTS have been charged and if convicted face a maximum 
15 year prison sentence. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Surabaya City Police Detectives (Polwiltabes 
ResKrim) followed up their investigation concerning the 
September Kalimantan Human trafficking and child smuggling 
investigation (ref c).  On Tuesday, Dec 18, Chief of 
Surabaya City Police (KaPolwiltabes), Commissioner Police 
Anang Iskandar, Chief of ResKrim Dedi Prasetyo, and Women 
and Child Protection Unit (PPA) Chief Sri Andriyani 
conducted a raid on the suspect safe house located at 
Kupang Segunting Street, Surabaya.  Four SUSPECTS were 
apprehended, 6 females were rescued; 4 were under-age 
children. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Second raid and arrests occurred on Thursday 
December 20.  South Surabaya Police resort (Polres) Adjunct 
Commissioner Pol Agung Marlianto, First Inspector Arif 
Suharto, and Adjunct First Inspector Sidik Wiyono conducted 
a raid on a suspect debt bondage/prostitution house located 
in the infamous Dolly/Jarak brothel area.   Three suspects 
were apprehended, 2 seventeen year old girls were rescued. 
All three suspects have been charged.   Sumirah faces 
trafficking charges and if convicted faces a three year 
prison term.  Hoo Tjoe Liong and his wife Kusdaryanti face 
a minimum 15 year prison sentence.  Initial information 
regarding debit bondage and child sex tourism in the 
Dolly/Jarak area was provided by local NGO to RSO Surabaya. 
 
¶5. (SBU)  On Saturday Dec 22 and again on Thursday December 
27, Surabaya RSO had a series of investigative follow-up 
meetings with Surabaya Police Commissioner Iskandar, 
ResKrim Chief Prasetyo, and Sector Chief Agung to review 
evidence recovered at the two raids, details surrounding 
the arrests, and discuss additional investigations 
involving Trafficking in Persons (T.I.P.) specific to the 
infamous Dolly and Jarak areas.  According to evidence 
recovered at the crime scenes and interview of subject

Abdul Kadir Karim, victims were promised work as bar maids. 
Individuals were promised a base pay of RP 1 million (one 
hundred dollars a month), daily incentive of RP 500,000 
(fifty US dollars) for each time they served drinks, free 
accommodation, paid airfare and pocket money.  Surabaya 
Police seized RP 9.2 million (nine hundred twenty dollars) 
and counterfeit parent permission slips for tour and travel 
to Malaysia.  Victims were offered a job at a Karaoke Bar 
which happens to be owned by one of the SUBJECTS arrested; 
Herriyanto.  Investigation does not show a nexus to 
the United States.

¶8. (SBU) According to sworn depositions, SUBJECTS Hoo Tjoe 
Liong, AKA Johan and Kusdaryanti sold there house maids 
Lily and Dita to Sumirah under the auspices of providing 
them a ?better life?.  Sumirah placed them into Jarak to 
work as prostitutes.  According to Sumirah, she would 
charge her ?customers?  RP 50,000 (USD equivalent of five 
U.S. dollars) for the services of the girls.  Lily and Dita 
would be allowed to keep only RP 10,000 of the proceeds 
from the ?dating price?.  Balance was kept by Sumirah. 
Lily and Dita came from families with low economic means 
and poor education.  The two girls were required to be 
available at any time.  The two girls were forced to pay 
additional cash expenses which included RP 10,000/day for 
room rental and RP 700,000 per week for "Royalties fees". 
These royalty fees were provided to Hoo Tjoe Liong, AKA 
Johan (RSO NOTE: The two girls were obviously unable to 
reimburse these exorbitant daily and weekly fees and thus 
found themselves in debit bondage.  Modius Operandi is 
consistent with previously obtained and known facts 
surrounding the Dolly and Jarak areas, costs and debit 
bondage fees.  This information has been repeatedly 
reported by RSO in previous cables. End note). 
 
¶9. (SBU)  Again, USG training and support was critical to 
this effort.  Over the last three years, East Java Police 
have worked closely with RSO Surabaya on Operation Triple 
¶X.  This three year ongoing investigative effort has 
resulted in thirty-six police raids, 140 arrests, nine 
 
SURABAYA 00003489  003 OF 003 
 
 
children and nine women rescued from Human Trafficking and 
child smuggling (T.I.P.).  Surabaya police charged all 
seven suspects under the newly enacted Trafficking in 
Persons Law, which took effect March 2007.  This anti-Human 
Trafficking legislation was drafted with the help of the 
Assistant United States Attorney assigned to AmEmbassy 
Jakarta and with the support of both US and local law 
enforcement and technical advisors, as well as with 
technical support by USG-government funded NGOs.   The 
Surabaya Police received training from the U.S. 
International Criminal Investigation Training (ICITAP) 
Trafficking in Persons (TIP) program.  Most recent training 
was completed in November.  Over the past three years, 
ICITAP has run five training programs for the Surabaya 
police force and local NGOs.  Trained in the need for 
assistance for victims, after arresting the traffickers, 
the police immediately contacted a local NGO to arrange 
assistance for the victims.  This local NGO, which 
specialized in helping the victims of trafficking, is 
itself supported by IOM, which is funded in part by the 
United States. 
 
¶10. (SBU) An important aspect of Operation Triple X is 
developing positive working relationships between anti-TIP 
NGOs working in Surabaya's red light districts and police. 
As T.I.P. operations continue to deliver additional results 
(three successful T.I.P. operations to date), and anti-TIP 
NGOs see police acting to free girls and bring them to 
shelters, we believe that ConGen Surabaya's role as a 
liaison between police and NGOs will diminish.  RSO is 
hosting an NGO/Police meeting scheduled for the second week 
of January.  This meeting is to assist in bridging the 
divide between the NGO's and police. 
 
¶11. (SBU) Additional information will be reported SEPTEL.
