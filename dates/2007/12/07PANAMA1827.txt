Weighing Overall Policy Review of Israel Resolutions 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶1. (C) "Panama is considering an overall policy review of its 
positions on the various Israel resolutions that come up 
every year in the UN General Assembly (UNGA)," First VP and 
FM Samuel Lewis told Ambassador on December 3 in response to 
reftel A demarche. Lewis added, "I don't know if there would 
be any change in our votes this year" on the three 
resolutions raised in reftel A.  Noting that there were 
several other Israel-related resolutions, Lewis said voting 
on these resolutions had become little more than "an 
accounting exercise" without any real thought or 
consideration being given to the substance of these 
resolutions. Noting that the MFA had proposed that President 
consider a trip to the Middle East in the first half of 2008, 
Lewis noted that as a non-permanent member of the UN Security 
Council (UNSC) "Panama wants to contribute to the peace 
process."

Comment

¶2. (C) Post believes that it is unlikely that Panama will 
change its votes on these annual resolutions for the current 
UNGA.  Panama will vote most likely just like it did in 2006. 
 Down the road though, cautious optimism that Panama might 
change its votes on Israel resolutions is warranted, but will 
need to be nurtured by U.S. (and Israeli) engagement with the 
GOP.
