Polling suggests economic pessimism 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶1. (U) An Expansion Ipsos poll conducted December 14-16, 2007 
showed that 50% of those polled thought that the economy had 
worsened during President Zapatero's tenure, 26% thought that 
it had not changed and 20% thought that it had improved. 
Curiously, however, 43% of Spaniards still think that the 
PSOE would do a better job managing the economy than the PP 
versus 41% who think the PP would do better. The socialists 
have a bigger advantage on political issues according to 
Expansion's polling - 50% think they would do better than the 
PP versus the 35% who think the PP would do better. (Comment: 
Inflation and higher interest rates have clearly caused the 
government to take a bit of a hit on economic issues.  So 
far, however, it remains to be seen whether this will prove 
to be a serious drag for the PSOE in the March 9, 2008 
elections.) (Expansion, 12/24/07) 
 
------------------------------ 
Bad Loan Rate Rises, Still Low 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (U) The percentage of bank, savings bank, and credit 
cooperative loans that are past due rose in October to 0.82 
percent, the fourth consecutive monthly increase and the 
highest level of the year, according to the Bank of Spain 
figures.  Each of the three types of institutions saw its 
percentage of bad loans rise.  The Spanish Banking 
Association expressed confidence that the sector could handle 
the increased delinquency rates, and a credit union 
representative noted that the rate was still well below 
European average.  (ABC 12/26) 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Largest Gas Storage Facility in Spain Planned 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) Gas network operator Enagas recently partnered with 
Spanish construction firm ACS and Eurogas Corporation to 
invest 1.2 billion euros in what will be Spain's largest 
natural gas storage facility.  This facility, which will have 
a storage capacity of 1.3 billion cubic meters of liquified 
natural gas will be developed in an abandoned oilfield off 
Spain's Mediterranean coast by the resort city of Castellon. 
It is expected to come on line in 2010 and will supply 
coastal areas such as Barcelona and Valencia.  The gas is 
expected to be imported from a variety of countries as Spain 
does not produce natural gas.  (El Pais, December 22)

Repsol Finalizes YPF Sale 
------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (U) Repsol announced December 21 that it had finalized 
the sale of 25 percent of its Argentinean subsidiary, YPF, to 
Argentina's Eskenazi family.  Repsol representatives 
indicated that it would sell 14.9 percent immediately for 
$2.24 billion with an option to buy the remaining 10.1 
percent within the next four years.  Once the deal is 
completed, an additional 20 percent of YPF held by Repsol 
would be floated on Argentina's stock market.  This 
transaction is in line with recent Repsol efforts to realign 
larger portion of its investment towards Africa and the 
Middle East. (El Pais, December 22)

Two High-Speed Trains Come on Line 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) RENFE train officials expressed satisfaction with the 
performance of the two new high speed "AVE" rail lines 
between Madrid and Vallodolid in the north and Madrid and 
Malaga in the south.  The lines were inaugurated on December 
 
MADRID 00002307  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
23, and although the initial rides to Valladolid experienced 
some delays, the majority reached their destination on time. 
Meanwhile there is little news about when the AVE line 
between Barcelona and Madrid, which originally was scheduled 
to open this month, will be completed.  Indications are that 
it will not open until after the March 9 elections.
