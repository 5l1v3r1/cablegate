     ¶B. STATE 163955 
 
¶1.  (U)  As anticipated (ref a), Canada has made a sizable 
commitment -- $300 million over the next five years -- in 
support of the Palestine Authority and the Middle East peace 
process.  At the Paris donors' conference on December 17, 
Foreign Minister Maxime Bernier pledged to "increase our 
participation in reform of the Palestinian security system in 
areas including the civilian police, justice, and 
corrections" and to "support institution-building in the 
Palestinian Authority and help build a better public 
service."  He also promised to help the Palestinian economy 
through private sector development.  However, he warned that 
future Canadian funding "is not unconditional" and said that 
Canada will look for "demonstrable progress in negotiations 
by both sides, as well as progress in Palestinian democratic 
reforms."  He reiterated that Canada's goal is "a viable 
Palestinian state that is democratic, accountable, and living 
in peace and security as a neighbour to Israel." 
 
¶2.  (U)  According to a background paper that the Department 
of Foreign Affairs and International Trade issued on December 
17, Canada in 2006-7 already provided $25 million in programs 
for the West Bank and Gaza, including humanitarian 
assistance.  In addition, Canada donated $15 million in 
support of Palestinian refugees through the United Nations 
Relief and Work Agency and unspecified other funding through 
the United States Security Coordinator.
