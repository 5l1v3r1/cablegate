REF: SHANGHAI 784 
 
¶1.  Summary.  Recent press and government reports put China's 
inflation rate at around six percent per year and attribute 
most of the rise to food prices, which constitute one third 
of the core index.  However, a recent visit to local markets 
indicates that the real rate of consumer price inflation ) 
at least in this part of China - is much higher.  A one-year 
comparison of a basket of staple foods showed increases in 
the range of 50-60 percent, and local consumers are clearly 
hurting.  End Summary

It's A Good Thing Inflation Is Low--Otherwise These Prices 
Would Kill Us 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶2.  After listening and reading much inflation-related 
commentary in the press, Econoff decided to visit a local 
supermarket to investigate for himself.  Armed with a grocery 
receipt from his first shopping trip after arriving at Post 
in December, Q006, he was able to  construct his own crude 
&market basket8 for calculating inflation.  Comparing item 
for item at the same store one year later turned out to be 
quite enlightening.  Only one of the seventeen items on the 
list, instant coffee, showed no inflation at all.  The 
increase for the other items ranged from 17 percent to 480 
(four-eight-zero) percent, most prices rising in the 40-50 
percent range. 
 
¶3.  While certainly not scientific, the comparison provides a 
fair insight into the problems faced by the local citizenry. 
The items on the list included primarily staple foods common 
to the Chinese diet.  Pork and chicken prices had doubled 
year-on-year, rice was up 33 percent, cooking oil was up 17 
percent, and bread was up 30 percent. 
 
¶4.  The really shocking increases were in the prices of fresh 
fruit and vegetables.  Carrots and tomatoes topped the list, 
at well more than four times last year,s price.  Lemons, 
papaya, and dragon fruit had all doubled, while apples and 
cucumbers had tripled.  Despite the price increases, the 
store was jammed with shoppers jostling to get the first pick. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Controlling Prices the Old-fashioned Way 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  Prices posted at a nearby traditional market were notably 
lower than at the &big box,8 western-style market visited 
at the first stop.  A vendor in the traditional market, 
however, confided to Econoff that things were not all they 
first seemed:  two key mechanisms allowed them to keep prices 
lower than those at the big markets.  The first step, she 
explained, is to buy produce that failed to pass the larger 
store's stricter testing and inspection regime, cheerfully 
noting that the rejected goods were much cheaper.  The second 
step, which she offered with a wink and a nod, is to raise 
the price slightly and, by adjusting the scale, make a 
corresponding reduction in the amount of food measured per 
kilogram.  She explained that this avoided discouraging 
customers by posting really high prices.

What Can You Do With the RMB 
---------------------------- 
 
¶6.  Econoff decided to add to his admittedly unscientific 
research by asking a sample of taxi drivers if rising prices 
posed a problem for them and their families.  The response 
was uniform across the board: rising prices were a major and 
growing hardship.  Most said they are dealing with the 
situation by eating more rice and less of everything else. 
Asked if the appreciation of the renminbi is making imported 
foodstuffs more affordable, one driver responded, "The only 
thing you can buy more of is U.S. Dollars.  But you can't eat 
dollars, and they buy even less rice than the RMB." 
 
¶7.  While not rigorously accurate, the above brief survey 
indicates that food price pressures on local citizens are 
likely much greater than what is being reported by government 
statisticians and the local press, the incidence being 
greatest on low-income groups.  Our purchases of equal 
amounts of identical items one-year later resulted in an 
overall price increase of 57 percent.  Unless there is real 
deflation in the other parts of the core index, it seems 
clear that the government's numbers, at least as they relate 
to Northeast China, are substantially lower than they should 
be.
