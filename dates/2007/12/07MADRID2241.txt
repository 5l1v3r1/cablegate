SUBJECT: SPAIN WILL NOT RESOLVE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ISSUE 
THIS LEGISLATURE 
 
REF: MADRID 2029 
 
¶1. (SBU)  SUMMARY:  After high-level engagement with the 
Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Justice, and Economy and 
Finance, it is clear that Spain will not act to extend full 
benefits and privileges to the Church of Latter Day Saints, 
the Buddhists, and the Jehovah's witnesses prior to the March 
2008 national elections.  We plan to pursue the issue with 
both the GOS and the opposition Popular Party (PP) prior to 
the elections, laying down markers that this will be one of 
our top bilateral priorities of 2008, whichever party should 
win.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  On December 5, Ambassador Aguirre spoke with 
Foreign Minister Moratinos again about the issue of extending 
full benefits and privileges to the Church of Latter Day 
Saints (LDS), the Buddhists, and the Jehovah's Witnesses in 
Spain, putting them on a level playing field with the four 
major religions in Spain - Roman Catholicism, Islam, 
Protestantism, and Judaism.  Moratinos said that the matter 
was with the Ministry of Treasury and would require that 
Ministry's approval to make it into the budgetary process for 
FY 2008.  Without approval from Treasury, a proposed 
amendment could not be considered in Parliament prior to the 
adjournment of the current legislature, which will adjourn 
for all non-budget business on December 20.  The next 
legislature will convene once a new government is formed 
following the March 2008 national elections. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  The DCM called Deputy Justice Minister Julio Perez 
Hernandez November 20 to discuss the matter.  Perez Hernandez 
told the DCM that he would review the matter very seriously 
and would see what could be done.  As Charge, DCM followed up 
with a letter to Perez Hernandez on November 21. 
 
¶4. (SBU)  The DCM spoke with Deputy Treasury Minister Ocano's 
chief of staff Mercedes Caballero at Treasury on December 5, 
as Ocano was unavailable due to final budget negotiations. 
Caballero informed DCM that to the best of her knowledge, 
Treasury had not received any instructions from policy makers 
in Justice or the Council of Ministers to move this 
legislation forward as a priority.  She said that if the GOS 
were serious about acting on such an amendment, Treasury 
would have received instructions by this time.  She was not 
aware of any inquiries from Justice, Foreign Affairs or the 
Council of Ministers into the fiscal implications of such a 
measure.  As such, it was a practical impossibility that such 
an amendment could be enacted prior to the adjournment of 
this legislature.  The DCM and Caballero did agree to convene 
an inter-agency group next year to develop the road map for 
the enactment of such legislation. 
 
¶5. (SBU)  We plan to hold follow-up meetings with GOS 
officials and members of the opposition Partido Popular to 
emphasize the importance of this issue to the U.S. and to 
underscore that this legislation should be high on the agenda 
of the new Spanish government in 2008.
