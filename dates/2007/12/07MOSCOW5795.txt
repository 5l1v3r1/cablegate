SUBJECT: RUSSIA SUSPENDS PARTICIPATION IN CFE TREATY 
 
REF: MOSCOW 5749 
 
¶1.  As expected, at midnight December 12, Moscow suspended 
participation in the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty 
(CFE).  According to the statement issued by the Foreign 
Ministry, Russia has suspended all actions under the Treaty, 
including exchanges of information on troop levels, and 
inspections.  The statement said that Russia would not be 
bound by any restrictions of the Treaty, including on the 
strength of conventional forces or flank deployments, while 
noting that the GOR did not presently intend to undertake a 
"massive build-up" of troops on Russia's borders.  Future 
deployments would be based on the specific political-military 
situation, "including the readiness of our partners to 
demonstrate restraint." 
 
¶2.  The statement attributed Russia's suspension to CFE 
requirements that affected Russia's security and which 
demanded urgent measures; to the failure of the NATO 
countries to ratify the Adapted Treaty and bring it into 
force; and to unacceptable linkages (e.g. Istanbul 
commitments).  Continued participation in the Treaty would 
"threaten Russia's national interests in the sphere of 
military security." 
 
¶3.  The statement reiterated that the GOR was ready to 
continue discussions and to lift the suspension once the 
following issues were resolved: 
 
-- How to account for new members of NATO; 
 
-- parameters for restrictions on the deployment of forces in 
foreign territories; 
 
-- elimination of the flank restrictions for Russia; 
 
-- Accession of the Baltics and Slovenia; and 
 
-- Ratification and entry into force of the A/CFE and 
commencement of its modernization.
