------------------------ 
"Dictator" Is a Dead End 
------------------------ 
 
¶1. (SBU) Characterizing Khalil Ibrahim as a "dictator" unable and 
unwilling to lead his movement to productive peace negotiations, the 
Justice and Equality Movement/Collective Leadership (JEM/CL) claims 
that its strength increases daily as Ibrahim's supporters realize 
his course is a dead-end.  Six JEM/CL commanders in El Fasher told 
Poloff on December 3 that even Suleiman Jamous has broken ties with 
long-time political ally Ibrahim because of his short-sighted and 
megalomaniacal approach. 
 
¶2. (SBU) With his military strength waning, "Dr. Khalil's friends in 
Khartoum will not even come and fight with him," said JEM/CL 
commander Abdulsalam Khitir, in a reference to Popular Congress 
Party (PCP) leader Hassan Al Turabi.  In addition, the 
diaspora--which has been JEM's financial, organizational, and 
intellectual base--has recognized Ibrahim as a spent force, the 
commanders claimed.  The critical "London Bureau" issued a statement 
in recent days backing JEM/CL leader Bahar Idriss Abu Gharda, 
Ibrahim's former Secretary General.  They did not object to 
Ibrahim's inclusion in eventual negotiations but called him 
"irrelevant to peace." 
 
---------------------------- 
Field Consultations to Begin 
---------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) The UN/AU plan to airlift 44 JEM/CL representatives from 
Juba to field locations in Darfur on December 6, spokesman Tajedinne 
Niam told Poloff by phone on December 4.  Abu Gharda, who is in 
N'djamena, and other JEM/CL partisans will join them.  They will 
then launch the final round of field consultations with the Sudan 
Liberation Army (SLA)/Unity to forge an alliance.  JEM/CL has 
delivered a request to the UN and AU to facilitate transportation 
for representatives from key foreign governments, including the 
U.S., to observe the consultations.  "We want this to be 
transparent," said Niam.  "We don't want to hide anything, and we 
want you (the U.S.) to have a real chance to observe events and 
witness the unification process." 
 
------------------------------- 
Differing Accounts on SLA/Unity 
------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) JEM/CL accounts differ, however, on SLA/Unity's internal 
cohesion and its effect on a possible alliance.  The JEM/CL 
commanders in El Fasher reported that the experienced Jamous--who is 
at least 30 years senior to the majority of the rebel field 
commanders--enjoys broad popularity among both SLA/Unity and JEM/CL 
while Abdullah Yehia and Sharif Harir--who control other elements 
within SLA/Unity--remain weak (reftel).  (Note: Discussion with 
SLA/Unity representatives will be reported septel.  End note.) 
 
¶5. (SBU) By contrast, Niam said that while Jamous and Sharif had 
"different influences" on the field, Yehia "seemed to be holding the 
movement together."  He predicted that "the whole" of SLA/Unity 
would unify with the United Resistance Front (URF) under a 
memorandum of understanding.  "SLA/Unity will rule out an alliance 
with Khalil, so their only alternative is us," explained Niam. 
(Note: The URF is an umbrella group of rebel movements formed in 
Juba that consists of JEM/CL and several more minor factions.  While 
it includes some Arab members, the JEM/CL commanders in El Fasher 
were firm that they are untrustworthy because "they go back and 
forth to the Government."  End note.) 
 
¶6. (U) Tripoli minimize considered.
