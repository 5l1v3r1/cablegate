¶3.  Comment:  When CDA Powers queried Amb. Sharfi concerning the 
reference to "negative reports about Dyncorp," Amb. Sharfi stated 
that he could not state more than that the Government has collected 
information about Dyncorp.  Amb. Sharfi went on to state that the US 
Embassy should not become further involved in this issue, for it is 
one to be addressed solely between AMIS (the AU) and the Sudanese 
authorities.  He concluded that US efforts to assist in this matter 
were having just the opposite effect, and resulting in further 
delays.  Amb. Sharfi repeated that the AU should be raising such 
issues and not the USG.
