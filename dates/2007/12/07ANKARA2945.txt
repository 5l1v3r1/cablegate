In Today's Papers 
 
TGS Chief General Buyukanit and General Saygun on the PKK 
All papers give extensive coverage to the messages issued by Chief 
of the Turkish General Staff (TGS) General Buyukanit and his deputy 
General Saygun at a TGS symposium in Ankara yesterday.  Liberal 
Radikal and mainstream Hurriyet headline with "Buyukanit:  'the PKK 
is legalized and has entered the Parliament.'"  Leftist-nationalist 
Cumhuriyet says "Buyukanit criticized the DTP harshly and said that 
the PKK is in the parliament."  Cumhuriyet reports that, speaking in 
a symposium organized by the TGS on 'Prevention of Economic and 
Ideological Support for the PKK/Kongra-Gel', General Buyukanit said 
"the PKK entered the parliament politically.  The PKK not only 
became politicized but is also legalized.  Acts that will encourage 
terrorist organizations should be avoided".  General Buyukanit added 
that "since the beginning of the conflict with the PKK, Turkey has 
overlooked some important values of humanity like human rights, 
democracy, freedom and peace.  The PKK gained support in the 
international arena by exploiting some of these values."  When asked 
about his remarks that the PKK is now legalized, General Buyukanit 
said "I meant their part in parliament.  They submit constitutional 
amendment proposals."  Deputy Chief of General Staff General Ergin 
Saygun criticized the EU and said "Europe, which supports the PKK, 
shares the responsibility of Turkey's loss of lives and property." 
 
 
"What are the generals saying?" 
Fikret Bila commented in mainstream daily Milliyet:  "The Generals 
once again declared to the public that some countries are applying a 
double standard when it comes to the fight against PKK terrorism. 
It is no secret that the US and EU are siding with us against the 
PKK only on a rhetorical basis, because they do not prevent 
financial and logistical support for the organization.  It is also a 
known fact that these countries have a common goal regarding the 
future of the PKK issue: they tend to take steps to have Turkey sit 
and negotiate with the PKK on a political level.  Both the US and EU 
consider Al Qaeda and related organizations as terrorists when 
terrorism is in question.  Their interpretation of the global fight 
against terror is limited only to those who harm them directly. 
From their perspective, the PKK is only a local and ethnic issue 
thus they are suggesting that Turkey work toward a political 
settlement.  Given the current picture, neither the US and nor EU 
are acting in collaboration with their declaration of the PKK as a 
terror organization.  Meanwhile, the PKK is using terror to impose 
its political goals upon Turkey while it does not face any counter 
deeds from the outside world." 
 
"Ending Terror" 
Ergun Babahan wrote in the mainstream daily Sabah: "Turkey has 
gained significant support and understanding in its fight against 
terrorism.  In this current atmosphere, Turkey should be able to 
take every possible step for ending PKK terrorism.  If a new law is 
required to attract PKK militants to come home, then the government 
should not hesitate to proceed.  Turkey's southeast is in the 
process of transformation; politics through violence does not 
attract support from people.  If political authority acts hesitantly 
when it comes to taking courageous steps, there will be consequences 
for generations to come.  Turkey is paying a heavy price for the 
fact that Turkish political authorities have always been hesitant 
and overly cautious in taking steps and making the right decisions 
at proper times.  The ruling AKP should be able to overcome the 
'hawks hurdle' within the party." 
 
The Opposition is against the Amnesty Law 
In an interview with mainstream Sabah, main opposition party CHP 
leader Deniz Baykal said that issuance of a "Back to Home" law in 
the American style will not work since those who are on the 
mountains are there to conduct politics.  Such a law would be a type 
of amnesty, which is part of the US plan for the region.  The US is 
allowing Turkey to conduct point operations in Northern Iraq against

the PKK, but on the other hand is telling the PKK not to take any 
action for the time being.  This is not a mentality to end the PKK, 
on the contrary, it is a mentality to support the PKK's survival. 
The government seems to be resigned to this mentality."  Liberal 
Radikal reports that opposition party MHP also criticized AKP on 
their policies for acting in line with US and EU recommendations. 
 
New YOK President:  "All bans will be lifted" 
Hurriyet, Zaman, Milliyet, Sabah, Yeni Safak, Radikal and ohers:  In 
his first message after undertaking the post of Higher Education 
Board (YOK) Presidency Prof. Yusuf Ziya Ozcan said that he will work 
to lift all bans in universities.  He said "I have two visions: one 
is to lift all bans in universities and to attach priority to their 
main duty, which is science." 
 
Karen Hughes: "We will re-gain Turks' hearts" 
Sabah, Zaman, Aksam, Yeni Safak:  US State Department Undersecretary 
for Public Diplomacy Karen Hughes said that the US will start a 
series of programs to re-gain the hearts of Turks.
