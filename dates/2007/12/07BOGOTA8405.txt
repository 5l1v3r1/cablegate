Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 

----------------------------- 
Uribe Offers "Encounter Zone" 
----------------------------- 

¶1.  (U) President Alvaro Uribe announced on December 7, that 
the GOC would accept a Catholic Church proposal to create a 
small "zona de encuentro" (encounterzone) toseek a 
"humanitarian exchange" of Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia (FARC)-held hostages for FARC prisoners in Colombian 
jails.  The GOC previously accepted a similar European 
proposal in December, 2005, which the FARC later rejected. 
Uribe said the zone would need to be approximately 150 square 
kilometers in size, in a sparsely populated rural area and 
have no existing police or military installations.  Unarmed 
international observers would preside in order to "define" 
the terms of the exchange.  FARC fighters would not be 
allowed into the area.  Uribe authorized Peace Commissioner 
Luis Carlos Restrepo, working with the Church, to seek 
contact with the FARC to find a location for the zone. 

¶2.  (C) Presidential advisor Jose ObdulioGaviria told us the 
GOC would appreciate U.S. support for the encounter zone 
proposal, at least in conversations in Bogota or with third 
countries.  He added that the GOC would not accept a return 
of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez or Senator Piedad Cordoba 
to the exchange process, noting that pressure on the GOC to 
do so had diminished. 

------------------------------- 
Low GOC Expectations for French 
------------------------------- 

¶3.  (C) Gaviria also told us the GOC would continue talking 
with the French on the hostage issue, but remained worried 
that the French will pressure the GOC rather than the FARC 
(reftel).  French DCM in Bogota Alain Fort separately 
confirmed that Uribe never offered French President Nicolas 
Sarkozy a mediator role, and details of possible French 
involvement remained unclear.  Fort said Peace Commissioner 
Restrepo made his December 4 announcement that he would 
travel to Paris for consultations with the GOF without 
consulting the GOF.  Hence, the GOF deferred the visit for 
"scheduling reasons."  Fort also said that Sarkozy did not 
coordinate his letters to FARC leader Manuel Marulanda  with 
the GOC; the GOF did give the GOC copies before releasing 
them publicly. 

---------------------------- 
USD 100 Million for Hostages 
---------------------------- 

¶4.  (U) President Uribe also announced on December 7, that 
the Ministry of Defense had identified USD 100 million to 
"stimulate the demobilization" of FARC members who liberate 
hostages.  FARC members willing to turn over their hostages 
and reintegrate into society would receive payment from the 
fund depending on case specifics.  Uribe previously announced 
that FARC members willing to demobilize and turn over 
hostages would receive benefits under the Justice and Peace 
Law.
