SUBJECT: Rising Inflation Challenges the Central Bank 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary: Turkey's headline consumer inflation was 1.95 
percent in November, considerably higher than the 1.58 percent 
consensus estimate, and this result surpassed even the most 
pessimistic economic forecasts.  Core indicators were not 
encouraging and non-food inflation picked up sharply.  Oil price 
increases hit hard in Turkey, which imports an annual average of $30 
billion.  The Central Bank (CBRT) inflation target is four percent 
and year-on-year November inflation was 8.40 percent.  If the CBRT 
yields to political pressure to cut rates at the December 13 
Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, inflation could continue to 
spike and the CBRT's credibility could be questioned.  End summary. 
¶2. (U) Turkey's November consumer price index (CPI) increased 1.95 
percent; while the producer price index (PPI) increased 0.89 
percent.  Year-on-year November inflation reached 8.40 percent for 
CPI and 5.65 percent for PPI.  Year-to-date inflation was 8.15 
percent for CPI and 5.78 percent for PPI.  The GOT's CPI target for 
2007 is four percent. 
¶3. (U) Overall inflation news was negative, however, in a December 4 
statement the CBRT claimed the medium-term inflation outlook was 
still on track despite short-term variations. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment:  According to market participants and the CBRT, 
the main short-term inflation risk is the government's upcoming 
decision regarding electricity and natural gas prices.  Despite 
inflation pressures, many investment banks believe the MPC might 
continue to cut the main policy rate by 25-50 basis points on 
December 13.  The Bank's short-term lending rate is now 16.66 
percent.  CBRT has been receiving pressure from politicians since 
the beginning of the year to cut rates to stimulate economic growth. 
 CBRT should balance these concerns against inflation pressures and 
take into account global economic conditions before making its rate 
decision.  End Comment.
