SUBJECT: VOTING INSTRUCTIONS AND EOV FOR AGENDA ITEM 54: 
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT: OIL SLICK ON LEBANESE SHORES 
 
 
¶1.    Mission is instructed to call for a vote and vote "no" 
on A/C.2/62/L.21 - Oil Slick on Lebanese Shores and deliver 
the Explanation of Vote (EOV) in paragraph 2. 
 
¶2.    Begin EOV text: 
 
Mr./Madam Chairperson, 
 
The United States cannot support this resolution. 
 
The resolution's language is one-sided and unbalanced, 
placing demands on one party to the conflict while failing to 
even acknowledge the role of those responsible for initiating 
the hostilities in Lebanon in July 2006.  It was Hizballah 
that provoked the conflict with its July 12 incursion into 
Israel and nowhere is that fact acknowledged in this 
resolution. 
 
The United States acknowledges the serious pollution 
resulting from the destruction of oil storage tanks in the 
vicinity of the Lebanese El-Jiyeh electrical power plant, and 
continues to support the Lebanese government in its 
reconstruction efforts following this conflict. 
 
However, the Second Committee has important responsibilities 
and should not be used to advance one-sided and unbalanced 
views on this matter. 
 
It is particularly inappropriate for the Second Committee to 
take a position on Israel's responsibilities regarding 
compensation for damage caused during the course of an armed 
conflict.
