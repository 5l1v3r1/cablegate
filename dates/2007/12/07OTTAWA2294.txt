 Â¶1.  (SBU)  In response to reftel demarche by PolMinCouns on 
December 20, Department of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade Director for UN and Commonwealth Affairs David Wittmann 
confirmed that Canada shared our concern about growth in the 
UN budget and that its delegation in New York was working to 
push back wherever possible.  He noted, however, that some 
growth items reflect our shared priorities, notably regarding 
management reform.  He expressed Canada's full support for 
the principle of budget restraint and promised to confer 
immediately with the Canadian mission in New York to urge 
continued close cooperation with USUN.
