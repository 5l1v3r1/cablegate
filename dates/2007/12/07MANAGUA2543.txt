REF: A. SECSTATE 157655 
 
     ¶B. MANAGUA 2008 (NOTAL) 
 
Classified By: CDA Richard Sanders for reasons 1.4 (b) & (d). 
 
¶1. (C) On December 4, we delivered a copy of the diplomatic 
note and of Pierre-Richard Prosper's CV to Orlando Gomez, 
Director General for American Affairs; David McField, 
Director General for Asia, Africa and Oceana; and Mario 
Barquero Baltodano, Acting Director General for International 
Organization Affairs, all at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
 Gomez received the documents and indicated that Nicaragua 
did not already have a commitment to support a candidate for 
the CERD and said he would recommend that his government 
place Prosper "at the top of their list." 
 
¶2. (C) Turning to another, more-distant UN election, Barquero 
noted that Nicaragua had already notified the U.S. of 
Managua's nomination of former foreign Minister Miguel 
D'Escoto as the GRULAC candidate for the 63rd UN General 
Assembly (Ref B).  He asked if there might be a way for the 
U.S. "to support D'Escoto's candidacy, or, at least, not 
actively oppose it."  We acknowledged that we had received 
and passed along the GON's diplomatic note on D'Escoto, and 
explained that the United States has a long-standing policy 
not to engage in vote-trading. 
 
¶3. (C) Baltodano stated that D'Escoto had already secured 
support of the Non-Aligned Movement during its September 
meeting in Tehran.  He said that one of the operative 
paragraphs of the final statement obligated NAM members to 
support the D'Escoto candidacy.  NOTE: Our quick search of 
the few documents that were made public following the NAM 
event in Tehran did not have any reference to the D'Escoto 
candidacy.  Our follow-up requests to Baltodano for 
clarification have not been answered.  END NOTE.
