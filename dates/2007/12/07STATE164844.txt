SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSE 05-050075628 
 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request. See paragraphs 2 - 4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a pre-license check on license 05-050075628 for the export of 
firearms to Turkey. Post is requested to complete this Blue 
Lantern check within 30 days. Lack of response to a Blue 
Lantern check will affect pending and future licenses 
involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for Request: End-user does not have a history of 
importing firearms in such large quantities. This check is to 
verify the bona fides of end-user, MKEK GENEL MUDURLUGU 
IKMAL, and determine the ultimate end-use of the United 
States Munitions List (USML) items listed below. 
 
¶4. Action Request: Post is requested to establish the bona 
fides of MKEK GENEL MUDURLUGU IKMAL as a reliable recipient 
of United States Munitions List (USML) articles. Post should 
also determine the client-base of MKEK GENEL MUDURLUGU IKMAL 
to whom these firearms may be resold. The following points 
are provided for guidance: 
 
(To MKEK GENEL MUDURLUGU IKMAL)-- How long has your company 
been in the business of importing and selling defense 
articles? Are you familiar with the restrictions governing 
the import of U.S. Munitions List (USML) commodities, in 
particular, the prohibition of unauthorized re-export? Who 
are your regular customers and where do they reside? Where 
are the firearms being stored prior to resale? Why is this 
order extraordinarily high in volume when compared to those 
of the past? Have you identified specific customers to 
purchase these firearms? 
 
In its reply, Post may also comment on any other information 
pertinent to this transaction such as security of facilities 
and concerns about the parties involved.
