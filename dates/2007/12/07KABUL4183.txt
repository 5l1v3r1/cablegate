SUBJECT: ANTI-TRAFFICKING: POLITICAL WILL, BUT LACK OF 
CAPACITY 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  The Afghan government has mustered the 
political will to combat trafficking in persons, but a lack 
of police enforcement and prosecutorial capacity slows 
progress towards meeting accepted international standards. 
The counter-insurgency campaign continues to draw police away 
from traditional enforcement and anti-trafficking functions. 
Key legislation that criminalizes trafficking and enacts 
tough penalties is set to go before the lower house soon, 
after spending years languishing in draft.  The Attorney 
General,s (AG) office and the Afghan National Police (ANP) 
are increasing their arrests and prosecutions of traffickers. 
 International NGOs are familiarizing the police, border 
police, the AG, and the judiciary with international 
anti-trafficking practices and obligations. 
 
Real Progress 
============= 
 
¶2. (SBU) The government has made measurable progress towards 
meeting international anti-trafficking standards. 
Legislation that would criminalize trafficking in persons and 
impose tough penalties is slated to go before the lower house 
of Parliament as soon as January.  NGO contacts, who have 
helped the Afghan drafters develop the legislation, believe 
it will be consistent with the Trafficking Victims Protection 
Act, while also incorporating elements of Shar,ia law.  The 
legislation would create an anti-trafficking commission, 
comprised of personnel from ten ministries and the Afghan 
Independent Human Rights Commission, which will be tasked 
with overseeing arrests, prosecutions, sentencing, victim 
protection and education programs throughout the country. 
¶3. (U) As of December 18, the Attorney General's Office 
reported 255 arrests of kidnappers/human traffickers in 
eleven provinces across the country this year, with the vast 
majority coming from Kabul.  Out of those arrested, 56 people 
were sentenced to prison terms ranging from two to five years 
each.  Investigations continued in 110 of the cases.  During 
the year, the ANP staffed a police station in Kabul with a 
special liaison, who also reports to the Ministry of 
Interior,s (MoI) child protection division, to deal with 
kidnapping and trafficking in persons cases.  Four more MoI 
liaison officers will be dispatched to provinces by early 
¶2008.  Earlier this year, the MoI rehabilitated approximately 
80 trafficked children and reunited them with their families. 
 In December 2007, the ANP arrested 20 people in Baghlan 
province, who were attempting to traffic another group of 80 
children to Saudi Arabia to work as servants. 
 
But Challenges Remain 
===================== 
 
¶4. (SBU) 30 years of war have destroyed or seriously 
debilitated most of Afghanistan,s governmental and civil 
institutions, especially those instrumental in combating 
trafficking and caring for victims.  Prosecuting the 
counter-insurgency campaign consumes leadership attention and 
preoccupies the police, who are already overstretched 
attempting to meet the civil security needs of a country the 
size of Texas.  As of mid-December, more than 1000 police 
officers, out of an estimated force of 50,000, have been 
killed, most by insurgents.  Police often serve at isolated, 
vulnerable checkpoints or border posts.  In Kandahar this 
November, suspected Taliban tortured five ANP to death and 
left their bodies hanging from trees.  Also in November, 
suspected Taliban beheaded seven police in uniform and left 
their corpses by the side of the road in Zabul province. 
 
¶5. (SBU) We continue to engage ministries with 
anti-trafficking responsibilities at senior levels. 
Ministerial interlocutors are uniformly responsive.  The 
Ministry of Justice eagerly provides data on arrests and 
prosecutions of traffickers.  We will monitor the progress of 
the anti-trafficking legislation through parliament and press 
for its rapid and full implementation.  We will continue to 
support NGOs active in the fight against trafficking, 
especially the International Organization for Migration and 
its anti-trafficking training programs for police and 
prosecutors.
