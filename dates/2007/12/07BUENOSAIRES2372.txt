NESTOR KEEPS ON GOING, AND A KEY WITNESS CLAIMS 
ANTONINI-WILSON WAS AT THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE ON AUGUST 6 
 
REF: (A) BUENOS AIRES 2360 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: The Kirchner-controlled Congress moved with 
exceptional alacrity December 19 to repudiate the U.S. for 
offending Argentina, and former president Nestor Kirchner 
continued to berate the USG, but singling out former WHA A/S 
Roger Noriega for vitriol.  Meanwhile, according to press 
reports, an Argentine prosecutor confirmed that she had 
testimony from a key witness placing Antonini-Wilson at the 
presidential palace two days after his $800,000 suitcase was 
intercepted.  End summary. 
 
Congress Takes Action 
--------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Argentine Congress, where President Cristina 
Fernandez de Kirchner (CFK) has a strong majority in both the 
Senate and Chamber of Deputies, voted December 19 to 
"repudiate" the U.S. for affronting Argentina in connection 
with the Miami arrests of Venezuela's unregistered agents. 
The Congress criticized the USG for failing to extradite 
Antonini-Wilson and instead "mounting a harmful intelligence 
operation that sought to damage the institution of the 
presidency of our nation."  The Chamber approved the 
resolution by a vote of 128 to 64 (17 abstentions), and the 
Senate voted 51 to 16 (one abstention) to approve.  None of 
the opposition voted for the resolution.  The opposition 
instead sought, but failed to win, the interpellation of FM 
Taiana, presidential chief of staff Alberto Fernandez, and 
Justice Minister Anibal Fernandez. 
 
Kirchner Keeps on Going 
----------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Former president and First Gentleman Nestor Kirchner 
resumed his harsh criticism of the USG.  At a year-end event 
for municipal governments, Kirchner criticized the USG's "bad 
attitude," alleging it sought through the media "to wear down 
recently inaugurated governments to keep them from joining 
forces."  He called on all Argentines to "defend and help" 
the maligned CFK.  According to "La Nacion," Kirchner's "main 
target" was former WHA A/S Roger Noriega.  Kirchner said "the 
Guantanamo case made certain sorry officials like Noriega 
nervous" and blamed him for "doing nothing but putting 
stumbling blocks in my way since he was always opposed to 
Latin American integration."  Kirchner then criticized 
Argentina's political opposition for "not having any ideas," 
and claimed Elisa Carrio, the runner-up in the October 28 
presidential election, was "an employee of Noriega" not 
worthy of debating. 
 
Antonini-Wilson at the Palace 
----------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Several major media outlets began reporting December 
20 that Argentine prosecutor Maria Luz Rivas-Diez claimed 
that Victoria Beresziuk, a GOA employee who was aboard the 
August 4 flight carrying the $800,000 suitcase from Caracas, 
had testified that two days later she saw Antonini-Wilson at 
the presidential palace, Casa Rosada.  According to 
Beresziuk's testimony, Antonini-Wilson was spotted at a 
signing ceremony in Casa Rosada on August 6 (the day of 
Chavez's visit to Argentina).
