RESOLUTIONS WITH ANTI-ISRAEL BIAS IN THE PLENARY 
 
REF: A. STATE 164424 
 
     Â¶B. KATHMANDU 2023 
 
On December 10, Emboff delivered Ref A talking points on 
opposing UNGA resolutions with anti-Israel bias in the 
plenary to Mani Bhattarai, Section Officer for the UN, 
International Organizations, and International Law Division 
of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Bhattarai sought 
clarification from Emboff on how exactly the United States 
wanted Nepal to vote but did not promise that his country's 
delegation to the UN in New York would not abstain. 
Bhattarai had been equally noncommittal when Emboff had 
delivered the previous demarche on opposing UNGA resolutions 
with anti-Israel bias (Ref B).
