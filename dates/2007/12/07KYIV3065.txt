SUBJECT: EN2008FEB(UKRAINE): NOMINATION FOR FEBRUARY USPTO-GIPA 
TRAINING ON IPR ENFORCEMENT 
 
REF: STATE 161326 
 
¶1. In response to ref A, Post nominates the following Ukrainian 
officials, in priority order, to participate in USPTO's Global 
Intellectual Property Academy (GIPA) training on IPR enforcement at 
USPTO headquarters in Alexandria, Virginia, February 11-14, 2008: 
 
-- Ms. Tatyana Sapalyova, Judge, Vinnitsa District Administrative 
Court 
 
-- Mr. Vitaliy Shchavinsky, Judge, Zhytomir District Administrative 
Court 
 
-- Ms. Tetyana Demchenko, Member, Scientific Advisory Board of the 
High Commercial Court of Ukraine (Section of Procedural and 
Intellectual Property Law) 
 
-- Mrs. Inna Shatova, Head of the IPR Enforcement Division, State 
Department of Intellectual Property (SDIP) 
 
¶2. Post requests funding for travel (including airfare), per diem, 
and lodging expenses for as many of the nominees as possible. 
Protecting intellectual property rights in Ukraine remains a 
priority U.S. goal.  Between 2002 and 2005, Ukraine was the only 
country given Priority Foreign Country status in USTR's Special 301 
report on the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property 
rights protection around the world.  The GOU has made significant 
efforts to improve its protection of IPR in recent years, however, 
and the USG lowered Ukraine's designation under Special 301 from 
Priority Foreign Country to Priority Watch List in early 2006.  Yet 
the government of Ukraine, one of the poorest countries of Europe, 
continues to be limited by budgetary considerations in its ability 
to address IPR infringement.  The nominees will likely benefit 
substantially from the GIPA training.  Post greatly appreciates 
Washington's consideration of this request for financial 
assistance. 
 
¶3. Post has listed the nominees in para 1 in priority order, i.e. 
with those we expect to benefit most from the training, and to have 
the greatest impact in improving IPR enforcement in Ukraine, listed 
at the top.  Numerous industry reps and even some GOU officials have 
described the courts, especially at the regional level, as the 
weakest link in IPR enforcement in Ukraine.  Tatyana Sapalyova is a 
newly-appointed judge in the Vinnitsa District Administrative Court, 
in western Ukraine, and could benefit greatly from exposure to IPR 
enforcement issues.  Vitaliy Shchavinsky is also a young judge who 
likewise could benefit from the GIPA program.  He serves in the 
Zhytomir District Administrative Court, in western Ukraine.  Tetyana 
Demchenko, who has passed her judicial exams and is expected to be 
appointed as a judge in the Kyiv City Commercial Court, already has 
significant expertise on IPR issues but would likely benefit from 
learning more about U.S. practice.  Inna Shatova, although a strong 
candidate due to her important position at SDIP, Ukraine's lead 
agency for IPR, has already participated in several Department of 
Commerce-financed IPR seminars, one of which was held in Washington 
- the others in Ukraine.  While she has not participated in the GIPA 
program, Post nominates her only as an alternate in case the number 
of worldwide candidates is low. 
 
¶4. Post will send an email notification of this nomination, along 
with the candidates' translated CVs, to USPTO liaison Barbara 
McCaffrey.  Post's POC for this program is Christian Yarnell, 
Economic Officer - Email: yarnellc@state.gov; Phone: 
011-380-44-490-4276; Fax: 011-380-44-490-4277.
