Never Let Your Guard Down

¶1.  (C) "You can never let your guard down with Iran," 
Panamanian First VP and FM Samuel Lewis told Ambassador in 
response to delivery of reftel demarche.  "We are working 
well with the U.S. a various levels on this issue." 
Concurring that it remained important to ensure that Iran 
respected Chapter VII UN Security Council (UNSC) Resolutions 
and that Iran fulfilled its obligations to the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Lewis underscored the 
"importance of maintaining P-5 cohesion on this issue."  MFA 
Senior Advisor for UNSC Matters Nils Castro, who accompanied 
Lewis, thanked the U.S. for facilitating a technical briefing 
on Iran's nuclear program by a Department expert scheduled 
for December 5.  "We have great difficulty understanding much 
of the technical issues concerning Iran's nuclear program," 
Castro said.  "We appreciate the U.S.'s willingness to help 
educate us."

¶2.  (C)  Lewis' willingness to see Ambassador on about two 
hours notice highlights his desire to be helpful to the U.S. 
on the Iran issue in the UNSC.  Lewis was also very 
appreciative of U.S. efforts to engage the GOP as a partner 
in the UNSC and to share extensive information regarding the 
U.S. views on Iran.  "I have been following closely the 
various communications from your government concerning Iran 
over the past few weeks," Lewis added.  The December 5 
briefing by an ISN expert provides a sterling opportunity to 
consolidate Panamanian support for the U.S. position, recruit 
an E-10 member willing to carry water for the U.S. in the 
UNSC, and ascertain in greater depth Panama's views on Iran's 
nuclear program.
