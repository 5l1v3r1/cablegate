MEETING 
 
REF: SECSTATE 162327 
 
¶1. (SBU) PolOff delivered reftel points on the Coordinated Mekong 
Ministerial Initiative Against Trafficking (COMMIT) to Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs Treaty and Law Division Deputy Director Xu Yu on 
December 3. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Noting that he shared our points with the Ministry of 
Public Security and other MFA offices, Xu said in a follow-up 
conversation on December 11 that China welcomed our views and takes 
U.S. concerns seriously.  The COMMIT agenda, he said, was agreed to 
by the COMMIT member states during earlier preparatory meetings in 
Bangkok.  He wondered why North Koreans were mentioned in our points 
since COMMIT deals with the Mekong region.  Some do not consider 
North Koreans to be refugees, he said, although he acknowledged that 
others might see them as trafficking victims.  Should any U.S. 
concerns not be addressed during the Beijing COMMIT meeting, he 
suggested addressing these issues at the appropriate U.S.-China law 
enforcement sub-dialogue.  Xu did not know if a joint statement 
would be issued following the Ministerial. 
 
¶3. (SBU) When asked if China's National Action Plan on trafficking 
in persons would be released during the COMMIT, Xu demurred, saying 
only that the event would certainly be a good time for China to 
release its plan.
