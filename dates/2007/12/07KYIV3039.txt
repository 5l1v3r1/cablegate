¶1. On December 11, we delivered ref A non-paper providing 
U.S. plans to sponsor a 5th anniversary Proliferation 
Security Initiative (PSI) conference to MFA Arms Control and 
Military Technical Cooperation Counselor Oleksandr Bondarenko 
and Attache Maryna Stroga.  Bondarenko opined that Deputy 
Foreign Minister Andriy Veselovsky might be designated to 
lead the Ukrainian delegation to the May 28, 2008, event, 
and, in response to our inquiry, said he sincerely hoped that 
Veselovsky would remain in his position until then, since he 
had a good working relationship with Veselovsky.  (Note: 
Former Foreign Minister Yatsenyuk was elected Speaker of the 
Parliament December 4, and with the possibility of a new 
government being confirmed in the near future, a shake-up of 
MFA senior leadership is likely.) 
 
¶2. At the same time, we provided ref B non-paper, and a 
courtesy Ukrainian translation, providing U.S. major concerns 
regarding Ukraine's proposed text of a PSI shipboarding 
agreement.  In doing so, we stressed our desire to receive a 
written explanation of the changes introduced in the 
Ukrainian January 2007 draft text and noted the possibility 
of holding further discussions on the margins of the next 
U.S.-Ukraine Nonproliferation Working Group (NPWG) meeting. 
We also informed Bondarenko and Stroga that the U.S. had 
proposed February 14-15 for the NPWG meeting.  Bondarenko 
said he had already circulated the non-paper to the relevant 
Ukrainian government offices (showing us the copy of the 
non-paper that he had received from the Ukrainian Embassy in 
Washington) and especially the State Border Guard Service. 
 
¶3. On November 20, we provided the results drawn from ref C, 
with a courtesy Ukrainian translation, of the results of the 
latest PSI Operational Experts Group (OEG) meeting to Maryna 
Stroga.  We asked her to ensure that information about the 
meeting, hosted by the Greek Government in Rhodes October 
2-4, was circulated appropriately within the Ukrainian 
government.
