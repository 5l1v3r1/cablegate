¶1. Iran: 
-------- 
 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
Senior columnist Yoel Marcus wrote in the independent, left-leaning 
Ha'aretz: "Olmert didn't start off well.... But he is striving to 
leave his mark as a prime minister with a peace agenda.  And for 
that, he deserves some support and credit." 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn and Washington correspondent 
Shmuel Rosner wrote in Ha'aretz: "And it is also going to be a lot 
harder for the Americans to persuade Israel, which has been left 
isolated on the Iranian front, to take security risks vis-a-vis the 
Palestinians and also perhaps with respect to the Syrians." 
 
Senior diplomatic correspondent Ben Caspit wrote in the popular, 
pluralist Maariv: "Note your calendar the month of January 2009, the 
month when George Bush will be replaced.  Until then, one can still 
hope for an American move. But in January, 13 months from now, it's 
the end.  Israel will have to take its own crucial decision." 
 
Senior commentator Nahum Barnea wrote in the mass-circulation, 
pluralist Yediot Aharonot: "Even if Bush wasn't happy with the 
reports conclusions, he couldn't do much about it.  When all of the 
US intelligence branches consolidate a united stance, the president, 
even if he is a popular one, has to give up." 
 
Political parties correspondent Sima Kadmon wrote in Yediot 
Aharonot: "If it wasn't so sad, it was probably funny.  Instead of 
leaving the shelters, taking a big breath of fresh air and being 
happy that the Iranian threat got postponed at least for a few 
years, there is an atmosphere of disappointment."

¶I. "He Deserves Some Credit" 
 
Senior columnist Yoel Marcus wrote in the independent, left-leaning 
Ha'aretz (12/07): "Olmert didn't start off well.  But aside from the 
fiasco of the Second Lebanon War and a series of criminal probes 
from his past dangling over him, he has not made any major blunder. 
As an arrogant hedonist, with his cigar and his Breitling watch, 
hobnobbing with the world's rich and famous, he is easy to badmouth. 
 But he is striving to leave his mark as a prime minister with a 
peace agenda.  And for that, he deserves some support and credit." 
 
II. "Itamar in return for Natanz" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn and Washington correspondent 
Shmuel Rosner wrote in the independent, left leaning Ha'aretz 
(12/7): "It is difficult to understate the importance of the blow 
that landed on Olmert and his policy this week [with the publication 
of the U.S. intelligence report regarding Iran].  'A terror attack 
by intelligence,' is what one Israeli defense source called it.  If 
Olmert wanted to play the Iranian card and hazard the chance that 
the U.S. would destroy the nuclear installations in order to enlist 
support for another withdrawal in the West Bank -- 'Itamar in return 
for Natanz' -- he has lost this card.  And it is also going to be a 
lot harder for the Americans to persuade Israel, which has been left 
isolated on the Iranian front, to take security risks vis-a-vis the 
Palestinians and also perhaps with respect to the Syrians." 
 
III. "Alone Facing Ahmadinejad" 
 
Senior diplomatic correspondent Ben Caspit wrote in the popular, 
pluralist Maariv (12/07): "The Israeli government is announcing in 
dismay: the Iranian bomb has died.... Israeli officials know that 
the American national intelligence estimation that was published 
this week creates a new, harsh reality: from now on, its only us and 
them. Iran and Israel.  Whoever counts on the world to intervene and 
prevent Iran from becoming nuclear, will wait a long time.... Note 
your calendar the month of January 2009, the month when George Bush 
will be replaced.  Until then, one can still hope for an American 
move. But in January, 13 months from now, it's the end.  Israel will 
have to take its own crucial decision. Is it taking the chance and 
allowing Iran to get closer or to pass the point of no return to a 
nuclear bomb, or is it becoming the master of its own fate." 
 
IV. "The Persian Shock" 
 
Senior commentator Nahum Barnea wrote in the mass-circulation, 
pluralist Yediot Aharonot (12/07): "And the Americans were happy too 
[with the intelligence report regarding Iran].  Their president may 
have a military option but they don't.  Not after Iraq. They heard 
from the intelligence chiefs what they wanted to hear.  At least 
half of them are willing to live with a nuclear Iran.... Even if 
Bush wasn't happy with the reports conclusions, he couldn't do much 
about it.  When all of the US intelligence branches consolidate a 
united stance, the president, even if he is a popular one, has to 
give up." 
 
¶V. "Political Damage" 
 
Political parties correspondent Sima Kadmon wrote in the 
mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (12/07): "When it seemed 
that everything is working out in favor of Prime Minister Olmert -- 
Annapolis, the closure of the Leumi Bank case, the renaissance in 
the relations with Bark and the proof of the stability of his 
coalition -- came the report [the US intelligence report].... If it 
wasn't so sad, it was probably funny.  Instead of leaving the 
shelters, taking a big breath of fresh air and being happy that the 
Iranian threat got postponed at least for a few years, there is an 
atmosphere of disappointment.... Security and diplomatic officials 
did their utmost to disprove the report.... but there is a pure 
political interest in all of this.  The Iranian threat gave jobs to 
many politicians.  It was the glue of different elements in the 
coalition.... The year 2008 that was supposed to be a year of harsh 
decisions is becoming more and more a year without excitements.  We 
expected to see this year a US action or at least an Israeli action 
against the Iranian nuclear reactor. And here the negotiations with 
the Palestinians are to begin in a week, the tension with Syria 
faded away, the operation in Gaza is lingering. So its no wonder 
that people in Olmert's office, when calculating the political 
damage against the benefits, captivate the American report is as 
damaging.  After all, if there was no Iranian threat, someone had to 
invent it."

¶2. Egypt: 
--------- 
 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
The conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized: "Egypt 
must be made to pay a steep diplomatic price for playing, even if 
more through inertia than initiative, the role of enabler for Hamas 
that Syria has played for Hizbullah in Lebanon.... Cairo needs to be 
told that it cannot enable the sowing of the seeds of war while 
pretending to facilitate peace."

"Demand Egyptian Action" 
 
The conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized (12/07): 
"The same Egypt whose blessing the US and Israel so eagerly sought 
for Annapolis has facilitated the weapons buildup that threatens to 
scuttle the process Annapolis sought to launch. This is absurd.... 
Until now, the US and Israel have politely complained to Egypt 
behind the scenes. This obviously has been insufficient.  The time 
for gentle nudging and hopeful appeals to reason and common 
interests has passed.... Egypt must be made to pay a steep 
diplomatic price for playing, even if more through inertia than 
initiative, the role of enabler for Hamas that Syria has played for 
Hizbullah in Lebanon.... Cairo needs to be told that it cannot 
enable the sowing of the seeds of war while pretending to facilitate 
peace."
