¶1. (U) Please find attached Post's updated assessment of Nicaragua's 
current and medium-term security needs as requested in reftel. 
 
A Chance to Build on Success 
----------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) In the past year, Nicaragua achieved its highest level of 
annual narcotics seizures to date and proved to be an effective 
choke-point against traffickers of illegal narcotics, arms, and 
immigrants transiting through the region.  Nicaragua also utilizes a 
community-policing model that has been successful in preventing the 
rise of national-level gang activities.  The Nicaraguan National 
Police (NNP) and the Nicaraguan Navy have achieved these successes 
despite such obstacles as low levels of funding, training, and a 
scarcity of law enforcement-related equipment and gear.  USG 
resources could dramatically enhance the capabilities of the 
Nicaraguan law enforcement regime, bolster goodwill with an 
authentically independent Nicaraguan institution, and grant the 
Nicaraguans a chance to build upon the solid foundations of their 
recent successes. 
 
Equipment Funding Needs 
------------------------ 
 
¶3. (SBU) Nicaraguan law enforcement and security forces are 
under-equipped and under-funded on a system wide basis.  However, 
after consultation with Nicaraguan officials Post has determined 
that the needs are greatest in four equally important critical areas 
(all prices in USD): 
 
A) IT Infrastructure - A lack of modern computing equipment greatly 
impairs the NNP's ability to share crucial law enforcement data 
between its divisions and coordinate operations as one cohesive 
organization.  The following prioritized list of equipment would 
significantly improve the situation: 
 
200 Desktop Computers with Uninterruptible Power Supplies ($400,000 
at $2000 per unit) 
60 Black and White Laser Printers ($48,000 at $800 per unit) 
Software licensing for all computers at $20,000 
i2 Intel Analyst Notebook systems at $100,000 
3 Computer Servers with racks ($90,000 at $30,000 per unit) 
12 Internet Access/Service Leases for Servers ($24,000 at $2,000 per 
unit) 
3 Generators to support Servers ($75,000 at $25,000 per unit) 
35 Digital Video Cameras ($17,500 at $500 per unit) 
30 Digital Still Cameras ($4,500 at $150 per unit) 
40 Digital Scanners ($6,000 at $150 per unit) 
25 Photocopy Machines ($87,500 at $3,500 per unit) 
 
Total: $872,500 
 
B) Basic Gear - Nicaraguan law enforcement officials are often 
lacking basic equipment necessities to ensure their safety while on 
duty.  The following prioritized list addresses this area of need: 
 
225 pairs of Leather Boots ($22,250 at $100 per unit) 
225 Hand Gun Holsters with Duty Belts ($33,750 at $150 per unit) 
100 Ballistic Protective Vests ($50,000 at $500 per unit) 
225 All Weather Parkas ($10,125 at $45 per unit) 
100 First Aid Kits ($5,000 at $50 per unit) 
225 Tactical Flashlights ($9,000 at $40 per unit) 
 
Total: $130,125 
 
C) Tactical/Communications Systems - The NNP's field effectiveness 
is hampered by a lack of tactical communications systems.  The 
following prioritized list addresses this area of need: 
 
150 Hand-held Radios ($112,500 at $750 per unit) 
50 Vehicle-mounted Radios ($37,500 at $750 per unit) 
30 Base Radio Systems with antennas and repeaters ($825,000 at 
$27,500 per unit) 
>L+=6Q-QQQ%4730 Hand-held GPS Devices ($7,500 at $250 per unit) 
35 Night Vision Devices ($280,000 at $8,000 per unit) 
 
Total: $1,262,500 
 
D) Interdiction/Monitoring Equipment - Nicaragua's current 
impressive interdiction record shows that the Nicaraguan law 
enforcement establishment has a proven track record of effectively 
using interdiction equipment.  The past year has been the best yet 
for interdictions in the history of Nicaraguan law enforcement. 
This success is attributable, in part, to improved detections at the 
land inspection station at Penas Blancas, where they are using one 
Ionscan machine.  However, the advent of the C4 Central American 
Common Market has increased the volume of commercial traffic passing 
through Nicaragua and strained Nicaraguan interdiction resources to 
the breaking point.  As such, Post proposes the following 
prioritized equipment procurements: 
 
4 Portable Ionscan Machines ($140,000 at $35,000 per unit) 
2 X-Ray Inspection Machines ($150,000 at $75,000 per unit) 
12 All Terrain Pickup Trucks ($252,000 at $21,000 per unit) 
10 Sedans ($120,000 at $12,000 per unit) 
35 Motorcycles ($280,000 at $3,000 per unit) 
 
Total: $807,000 
 
The total amount of Post's proposal for Nicaragua's police equipment 
needs is $3,072,125. 
 
Prison Management & Conditions 
------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Nicaraguan prisons are generally overcrowded and are 
equipped with substandard facilities for both prisoners and prison 
staff.  The Nicaraguan Government does not have adequate funding to 
effectively address prison management issues.  In particular, 
Nicaraguan prison management officials could benefit greatly from 
training on standard prison operations and practices. 
 
Looking Ahead 
-------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Looking ahead to the medium term, Post assesses that 
repairs and improvements to Naval facilities damaged by Hurricane 
Felix will be critical to helping Nicaragua maintain its maritime 
interdiction capabilities.  In addition, the cost of maintaining 
Nicaragua's Naval interdiction fleet will grow significantly as the 
Navy continues to upgrade its coastal patrol ability and range.  The 
purchase of a helicopter would also enable Nicaraguan authorities to 
greatly enhance their anti-narcotics surveillance abilities. 
 
Comment 
-------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Nicaragua, and in particular the Nicaraguan law enforcement 
establishment, is committed to the success of the Merida Initiative. 
 However, the ability of Nicaraguan law enforcement officials to 
effectively carry out their duties is being threatened by the 
determination of the current Sandinista regime to politicize the 
entire Nicaraguan law enforcement and security establishment.  In 
our view, a timely injection of USG support now would go a long way 
towards helping the Nicaraguan police and military maintain their 
institutional independence and operational effectiveness and have 
the added benefit of helping to maintain political stability in 
Nicaragua.
