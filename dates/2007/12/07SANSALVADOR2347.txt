¶1. (U) On November 30, Poloff delivered reftel demarche and 
talking points to Gustavo Argueta, MFA Official in Charge of 
UN and Multilateral Fora.  Argueta acknowledged the US 
position on such resolutions and added that El Salvador 
strongly supports the Middle East peace process.  He also 
said that in recent years El Salvador has moved towards what 
he described as "a more balanced approach" to relations with 
Israel and the other countries in the Middle East. He pointed 
to El Salvador's decision to move its Embassy in Israel from 
Jerusalem to Tel Aviv as an example of this new approach.

strengthening and expanding its relations with several Arab 
countries.  He added that El Salvador continued to have 
excellent relations with Israel, and this week he had met 
with Mattanya Cohen, Israel's Ambassador to El Salvador, to 
receive a document outlining Israel's plan for this year's 
UNGA and to discuss UN issues. 
 
¶3. (U) Argueta said that he would communicate the US position 
through appropriate channels and would be open to further 
discussion on specific resolutions.
