¶1. (SBU) Summary. Former Defense Minister and Umma party adherent 
Fadlalla Burma Nasir told CDA Fernandez on December 4 that the 
NCP-Umma party dialogue initiated on November 27 might be beneficial 
to both sides "if the dialogue is genuine."  He said the NCP 
recognized that Sudan's international reputation has suffered due to 
Darfur. Nasir expressed optimism that the NCP-SPLM impasse could be 
resolved, and proposed that to solve the Abyei issue the Messiriya 
and Dinka tribes should be permitted to work out the Abyei 
demarcation issue themselves. End summary. 
 
NCP-UMMA COOPERATION: BOTH CAN BENEFIT 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Asked about the December 3 follow up meeting between 
President Bashir and Umma party Chief Sidiq Al-Mahdi (Ref A), Nasir 
said, "It's good to have a dialogue, if it is sincere."  Nasir 
expressed cautious optimism about the outcome. "They have crossed us 
before, but this time, if it is genuine, both parties can benefit." 
Nasir said that both parties had nominated five representatives and 
agreed to promote a national dialogue.  "This is not just a 
party-to-party effort, but a national one."  He said the Umma 
party's Al-Mahdi told Bashir that they would go to each meeting 
"with our own strategies for the nation."  Nasir said the Umma party 
is cautious in its dealings with the NCP. We are aware of their 
tactics of engaging in meetings and getting agreements, but not 
always fulfilling their promises, he said. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Nasir repeated the often heard Umma call to open up 
national politics to others, beyond the NCP and SPLM.  "If the NCP 
is serious about national politics, they will need to consider 
others and not just our two parties," said Nasir.  For example, the 
government recently released Mubarak Al-Fadel, but what about the 
others who were arrested with him, asked Nasir to make a point. "The 
National Congress Party (NCP) needs to address human rights and 
release all political prisoners."  Nasir said that the Umma party 
urged Bashir's NCP to "work together to solve national problems that 
afflict us both, and not focus exclusively on party problems," and 
with a nod to CDA Fernandez, added that Sudan needs to ask how to 
better relate internationally as well. 
 
OUR INTERNATIONAL REPUTATION IS BAD BECAUSE OF DARFUR 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶4. (SBU) Nasir said that Presidental advisor Mustafa Othman Ismail 
had noted at the December 3 meeting that "Our international 
reputation is bad," because of issues like Darfur and the "teddy 
bear incident".  The NCP has a big problem dealing with the Darfur 
issue because if there is no Sudanese cooperation on Darfur, it 
would be hard for the international community to trust Bashir's 
Sudanese government, said Nasir.  Nasir, a professional soldier, 
opined that the offered troops, such as those from the Thailand and 
the Gurkhas from Nepal, are professional soldiers, and the GoS 
should accept them.  As for the problem of the internally Displaced 
Persons (IDPs), Nasir commented that the present government needs to 
somehow reassure the IDPS (who don't trust the government) to get 
them to return to their homes.  Asked about Chinese peacekeepers, 
Nasir said that westerners have a reputation, such as when they rent 
houses, to leave the situation better than they found it. Not so the 
Chinese, hg said.( "Tu Chi~g3e ave mnly thinKinw Of#i,, whileQ
