SUBJECT: U PARTY REMAINS DIVIDED HEADING INTO 2010 


------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 

¶1. (C) The U Party continues to consolidate its party 
structure following the October local elections, with Party 
leaders focused on quashing internal dissent and developing a 
plan to enable it to maintain strong ties with whoever wins 
the 2010 presidential elections.  Still, the Party's poor 
relations with President Uribe and the Casa de Narino mean 
its leaders will likely have little influence in deciding who 
will represent "Uribismo" 2010. Presidential advisor and 
political strategist Jose ObdulioGavaria predicts the Party 
will disappear after 2010. End Summary 

-------------------------- 
U PARTY IN LOCAL ELECTIONS 
-------------------------- 

¶2. (C) The U Party fared well October 28 in its first effort 
in local elections, picking up 7 gubernatorial seats in the 
Departments of Meta, Magdalena, Choco, Casanare, Guainia, 
Vichada and Sucre, and 3 mayoral seats in departmental 
capitols (Quibdo, Puerto Inirida, and Pereira).  In total 
number of votes, the U Party came in third, just behind the 
more established Conservative and Liberal Parties. Senator 
Carlos Garcia, president of the U Party, told us the party 
succeeded in consolidating a regional base, which will 
strengthen the party leading up to the 2010 presidential 
elections. 

-------------------- 
UNITY AND LEADERSHIP 
-------------------- 

¶3. (C) The U Party remains fractured, with an "all chiefs and 
noindians" structure that has crippled its ability to 
develop a coherent platform--apart from support for President 
Uribe.  A dissident group within the Party--former Party 
President and Senator Marta Lucia Ramirez, Senator Gina 
Pardoli, Senator Armando Bendetti and Deptuy Nicolas 
Uribe--say Party leaders abandoned President Uribe's 
political reform agenda in favor of traditional backroom 
political deals, shady political ties, and manipulation of 
internal party rules to stifle party democracy.   They  blame
Garcia for focusing on jobs for the boys and supporting 
candidates with paramilitary links in the October local 
elections.  They also criticize U Party founders and current 
cabinet members Juan Manuel Santos and Oscar Ivan Zuluaga for 
largely withdrawing from internal Party politics. 

¶4. (C)  Garcia told us the dissidents are unhappy because 
they have lost senior positions within the Party, and 
represent a small but vocal minority.  He confirmed the Party 
will hold a congress on December 13, aimed at refining party 
rules and setting the stage for possible disciplinary 
actions--or even expulsion--of the dissidents.  President 
Uribe interceded on behalf of the dissidents in October, but 
Garcia told us party rank-in-file members have exhausted 
their patience. The dissidents need to fall in line or face 
the consequences. 

¶5. (C)  JaimeRestrepo, U Party Spokesman in the House, 
acknowledged the dissidents' complaints, but said they need 
to voice those concerns within the party rather than to the 
media.  Uribe added that he is pessimistic about the party's 
future.  He plans to push for a long-shot reform bill that 
would allow himself (and others in Congress) to switch 
political parties while serving in Congress.  Current law 
requires legislators to leave Congress if they change party 
allegiance. 

----------------------------- 
RELATIONS WITH CASA DE NARINO 
----------------------------- 

¶6. (C) It remains unclear how close the U Party is to 
President Uribe and the Casa de Narino.  Garcia and Restrepo
claim there is a close relationship, but presidential advisor 
Jose ObdulioGaviria told us communication between the Party
and the presidency is poor.  He said Uribe set up the Party 
to give him a solid congressional base, but complained the 
Party does not support President Uribe's programs or 
policies. It is not an effective vehicle for preserving the 
President's legacy.  He predicted the Party will disappear 
after the 2010 presidential elections.  Former presidential 
advisor Nicolas Uribe agreed the Party-Presidential 
relationship is weak, noting that the "Casa Narino sets its 
own policy and does not care whether they have support or 
friends in Congress, including from the U Party." 

--------------------------- 
2010 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS 
--------------------------- 

¶7. (C) U Party leaders recognize the 2010 presidential 
elections will likely determine the Party's fate.  Despite 
the tensions with President Uribe, some party leaders support 
a third term for the president and Party Secretary General 
Luis Guillermo Giraldo has publicly launched a drive to 
collect the signatures needed to push for a constitutional 
amending allowing Uribe to run again (see septel).  Other 
leaders are trying to recruit a candidate, such as outgoing 
Medellin Mayor and political independent Sergio Fajardo, who 
could win Uribe's blessing and maintain his coalition. 
Garcia told us the U Party's weaknesses--its newness and lack 
of coherent political ideology--may be its greatest asset, as 
the U Party can be a natural fit for any candidate.  Still, 
the Party's tenuous ties with the President and sharp 
internal divisions means its leaders are likely to have 
little influence in deciding who will represent "Uribismo" in 
¶2010.
