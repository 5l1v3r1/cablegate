SUBJECT: FINLAND HOPEFUL GOING INTO BALI CLIMATE CONFERENCE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 159374 
 
 ¶1. (SBU) Econoff delivered reftel demarche on the U.S. 
position on climate change going into the UN Climate 
Conference in Bali to Ms. Outi Berghall and Ms. Sirkka Haunia 
from the Finnish Environment Ministry.  As Finland's chief 
climate negotiator, Berghall will lead the Finnish delegation 
prior to the Ministerial portion of the Conference.  Berghall 
said she was 'hopeful' that a concrete roadmap forward would 
come out of Bali, with the prospects of a final agreement 
being reached in Copenhagen.  Berghall continued by stressing 
positive U.S. movement on climate change - including the 
Major Economies effort - is having a significant impact on 
developing countries choosing to participate more fully in 
the UNFCCC process. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Berghall shared that Finnish Prime Minister Matti 
Vanhanen will insist that climate change be on the agenda of 
all bilateral high level meetings the Finnish government 
participates in for the foreseeable future.  Berghall will 
retire soon, leaving her likely incumbent to be Sirkka 
Haunia, also from the Environment Ministry. 
 
Comment: 
--------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) There is an air of confident optimism in Finland 
heading into the Bali conference.  Despite the potential for 
disagreement, Finland recognizes significant momentum on the 
part of the U.S. on climate change.  For the Finns, success 
in Bali hinges on formulating a strong roadmap that will 
ultimately lead to binding commitments.  Berghall indicated 
her concern over potential leakage in any agreement, even if 
such agreements were legally binding.  End Comment.
