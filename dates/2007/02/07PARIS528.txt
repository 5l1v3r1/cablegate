¶1.  (SBU) We conveyed ref C message about Liberia's arrears to the 
office of Cooperation Minister Girardin on February 7, and to the 
MFA on February 8.   According to the MFA, France is quite close to 
re-opening its embassy in Monrovia.  The French have asked the 
Liberian government for agrement for their proposed chief of 
mission, MFA official Jacques Gerard (currently stationed in Juba, 
Sudan).  Once the Liberians respond, the French plan to move 
expeditiously to reopen their mission.  The MFA hopes Gerard will be 
able to attend the Partnership Forum in Washington. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) We spoke on February 7 with Jerome Walter, advisor to 
Cooperation Minister Brigitte Girardin.  Walter promised to pass the 
message to Girardin.  He noted that the African Development Bank had 
gone beyond the norm for use of PCCF in clearing arrears for the 
Central African Republic, and perhaps something similar could be 
done for Liberia.  He added that Girardin would be represented at 
the Partnership Forum by the Ministry of Finance's Financial 
Counselor for Africa, Serge Tomasi. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) On February 8 Ramon Fernandez, PDAS for international 
finance and development affairs at the French Ministry of Finance, 
told us he had seen the Finance Minister of Liberia last week in 
Paris and made the point that France strongly supports Liberia.  But 
on arrears clearance there is a need to follow rules.  He concluded 
that France remains ready to help on this matter.
