SUBJECT: CZECHS WILL BACK EU RESPONSE TO VENEZUELA'S DENIAL 
OF A LICENSE FOR RADIO CARACAS TELEVISION 
 
REF: STATE 12181 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) Poloff met with MFA Director of Americas Jakub 
Skalnik on February 6 to discuss Venezuela's recent efforts 
to silence Radio Caracas television by refusing to renew its 
license. Skalnik said the Czechs see the refusal as a threat 
to the freedom of the press in Venezuela, and part of 
President Chavez's overall plan to remake the country 
according to his vision. Skalnik said the EU's response will 
be discussed at the upcoming COLAT meeting. The Czechs plan 
to support the EU consensus position, with may include a 
Troika demarche and an approach to the OAS Secretary General. 
They do not currently plan to demarche the GOV on a bilateral 
basis, because they do not think such an approach would have 
any impact on Chavez.
