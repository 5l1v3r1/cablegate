¶1.  (SBU)  Summary.  Oure Cassoni refugee Camp, close to the 
Sudan border, continues to be highly politicized.  Both the 
camp and the host community of Bahai lack security (reftels). 
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is 
active in trying to repatriate Sudanese soldiers hospitalized 
in Bahai as well as others reportedly held as POWs by 
Sudanese rebels inside Chad.  End Summary. 
 
Oure Cassoni Refugee Camp Remains Extremely Politicized 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
¶2.  (U)  The Oure Cassoni Refugee Camp, housing over 26,000 
 
Sudanese refugees, remains extremely politicized and under 
the influence of Sudanese rebels.  During a meeting with the 
USAID Humanitarian Assistance Team last month, several 
attendees insisted on raising political issues with EmbOff, 
rather than the humanitarian assistance issues the meeting 
was convened for, and presenting a package of political 
mini-banners.  Several attendees later reported intimidation 
and coercion by camp leaders to suppress certain views.  One 
view camp leaders tried to suppress is that the camp is not 
secure (as evidenced by assaults and carjackings occurring 
within the camp itself).  Due to the camp's location close to 
the border, this is one of two refugee camps that UNHCR would 
like to move further away from the border.  However, the camp 
leaders want it to remain where it is, and continue to serve 
as a rebel rear base. 
 
 
Insecurity and Lack of Projects To Benefit Host Community 
--------------------------------------------- ---------------- 
 
¶3.  (U)  The lack of security also affects the small host 
community of Bahai (approximately 20 miles from the camp, and 
with a population estimated at 2,000 people) and other 
smaller villages.  NGOs have their compounds here, and have 
to be escorted by gendarmes, even to travel short distances 
between compounds.  All NGOs store their vehicles at night in 
the UNHCR compound.  The prefet made a complaint (heard 
elsewhere) that the gendarmes would be more effective if they 
were from the area, rather than from elsewhere in Chad.  It 
was reported that not all of them have firearms.  The UN is 
in Phase IV security, which has resulted in minimum staffing 
for UNHCR itself and the NGOs who work in this area.  NGOs 
report that they had projects planned for local villages, 
such as drilling wells, but, due to the security situation, 
they could only visit two of the sixteen villages in the 
area. 
 
 
Attacks in the Area 
-------------------- 
 
¶4. (U)  In addition to fighting in the area in October, there 
have been reports of Sudanese Air Force Antonovs dropping 
bombs in the area in January and more recently this month. 
Allegedly, on one or two occasions, the bombs struck close to 
the dam on Lake Cariari (the dam has made this wadi into an 
artificial lake, and its destruction would be devastating for 
Oure Cassoni).  However, the consensus of people actually 
there is that the target was a rebel column, not the dam 
itself, and that the Antonovs are very inaccurate bombing 
platforms (they are cargo aircraft, not bombers, and the 
bombs are rolled off the rear cargo ramp). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ICRC Repatriation 
----------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU)  In mid-January, 14 wounded Sudanese soldiers still 
remained in the Bahai Hospital, where they had been brought 
following heavy fighting on the Sudan side of the border in 
early October. The International Committee of the Red Cross 
(ICRC) is negotiating for their repatriation.  The NGO 
community in Bahai informed EmbOff that Sudanese rebels were 
rumored to be holding up to 200 GoS soldiers as prisoners of 
war (POWs) somewhere in the general area.  The presence of 
additional Sudanese soldiers was subsequently confirmed by 
the ICRC which advised that they are involved in negotiating 
their repatriation as well; they also report that no one on 
either side seems anxious for the GoS POWs to be returned. 
 
¶6. (U) Tripoli minimize considered.
