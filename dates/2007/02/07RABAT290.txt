SUBJECT: WESTERN SAHARA: GOM AUTONOMY DELEGATION HOLDS 
PRESS CONFERENCE BEFORE DEPARTURE 
 
¶1. (SBU) The Moroccan delegation in Washington to discuss 
autonomy held a press conference in Rabat February 9 to 
discuss their meetings and Paris and Madrid and to brief 
local press on their effort.  According to press accounts 
February 12, they disclosed no new details on the autonomy 
plan, but stressed that it was 80 percent complete and that 
consultations would be more widespread. 
 
¶2. (U) Moroccan Minister of Interior Chakib Benmoussa, 
Foreign Minister-Delegate Taieb Fassi Fihri, Interior 
Minister-Delegate Fouad Ali El Himma, and the Director 
General of External Intelligence Yassine Mansouri held an 
informal press conference, discussing internal issues 
(septel) as well as the Sahara. El Himma confirmed that the 
delegation had not provided their European counterparts with 
a written draft of the Moroccan plan for autonomy in the 
Western Sahara.  Instead, he noted, they shared with French 
and Spanish officials the general outlines of the proposal, 
which "will respect international law."  He added that the 
government is currently considering referendum to vote on the 
proposed plan, but had not decided whether it would be held 
on a national or regional (Western Sahara) basis. 
 
¶3. (U) The delegation noted that the plan would be an 
"enlarged autonomy," that would be a greater level of self 
government than existed in much of Europe.  It was neither 
confederalism nor federalism and even less centralism and 
tied to overall GOM regionalization efforts.  It will apply 
to the Western Sahara territory, which they maintained 
contained  two-thirds of Sahrawi population.  The delegation 
asserted that the plan was already widely consulted in 
Sahrawi society as well as within Morocco.   They downplayed 
the value of engaging the Polisario. They deplored the effort 
last October at the UNSC to inject human rights issues into 
the debate.
