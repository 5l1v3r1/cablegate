businesses at parts of the provinces in eastern and southeastern 
Turkey closed their businesses for one day in protest of the 
eighth anniversary of arrest of Abdullah Ocalan by the Turkish 
authorities on February 15; sporadic illegal demonstrations took 
place.  Businessmen in parts of Diyarbakir did not open their 
businesses in the morning hours.  The dailies report some 
businesses as choosing to stay open in Hakkari.  Around 10 a.m. 
in the morning, Hakkari Deputy Governor, Hakkari Commando 
Brigade Commander and Provincial Jandarma Commander and the 
Security Director paid visits to tradesmen and thanked those who 
chose to stay open throughout the day.  Sabah daily reports that 
when tension broke out between a jewelry shop owner and a group 
of DTP members who tried to convince the jeweler to close his 
business in Yuksekova, the 17-year-old son of the DTP district 
chairperson was wounded by gunfire.  The daily observed that 
some businesses in Mersin, Sirnak, Siirt, Mardin, Batman, 
Sanliurfa and Adana acted in accordance with the call of the 
terrorist organization.  In Batman, police detained 11 people 
making preparations to launch activities with Molotov cocktails. 
In Diyarbakir, tradesmen in Baglar, Surici, Sehitlik and 
Kayapinar quarters observed the rule of shutting their 
businesses, however, the tradesmen in the main streets of 
Diyarbakir, in Ofis and Yenisehir quarters reportedly stayed 
open. People, mostly children, conducted illegal demonstrations 
in Mersin.  Diyarbakir Governor's Office circulated a request 
from the public institutions to report staff members and workers 
who boycotted work yesterday and the students who boycotted 
school. 
 
GUNDEM: The pro-PKK newspaper Gundem reports that ninety 
percent of tradesmen in Diyarbakir closed their businesses 
yesterday.  Hundreds of people, civil society organizations, 
some mayors and DTP members reportedly gathered in front of the 
DTP party headquarters and held a silent march towards the 
Kosuyolu Park in Diyarbakir.  Women wore white headscarves and 
put on a black ribbon around their heads as if they wore a 
shroud.  The protests occurred in Mardin's Nusaybin, Kiziltepe 
and Derik districts despite strict security measures taken by 
the police there.  The daily reports that there was a high level 
of tension in Kiziltepe throughout the day and tradesmen there 
strictly complied with practice of not opening their businesses. 
 The demonstrators, most of whom were comprised of children and 
youth, set small fires with tires, carried posters of Abdullah 
Ocalan and flags of so-called democratic confederalism, chanted 
slogans in Kurdish and Turkish in support for Abdullah Ocalan. 
Some clashes took place at times when police intervened in the 
ongoing protest activities.  The daily further gives detailed 
reports about demonstrations that went on throughout the day 
yesterday in sections and districts of Diyarbakir, Van, Batman, 
Siirt, Hakkari, Mersin and the refugee camp in Maxmur in 
northern Iraq.  The brochures being delivered in those places 
urged people to close down their businesses for one day and 
urged students to boycott schools. The brochures further told 
people to fast, wear black apparel, and not go out in the 
streets, as a sign of protest against Ocalan's arrest. 
 
ADANAHABER ONLINE / BOLGE:      A group of pro-PKK protestors held

put out sporadic fires caused by burning tires.   The anti-riot 
teams have been striving to control the situation at the site of 
the protest.
