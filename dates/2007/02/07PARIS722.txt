SUBJECT:  FY 2007 NOMINATION FOR USUNESCO VOLUNTARY VISITOR AURORA 
MATEOS 
 
 
Mission requests a Voluntary Visitor Program for Aurora Mateos, a 
Spanish citizen who is the main point of contact at the UNESCO 
Secretariat for the IOC Advisory Body of Experts on Law of the Sea 
 
SIPDIS 
(ABE-LOS).  Over the past six years, the U.S. has found that ABE-LOS 
serves to reinforce U.S. policy with regard to oceans science.  Both 
the IOC and Mateos would benefit from greater collaboration on Law 
of the Sea matters with the UN Division of Oceans Affairs and Law of 
the Sea, which is located in NYC. Mateos has received full country 
team approval per '03 State 173181-C. 
 
Mission would like to provide Mateos an opportunity to meet with 
counterparts in the US, through visits to US institutions involved 
in managing the Marine Scientific Research regime of UNCLOS. 
 
Program suggestions include meetings with the following: 
- Department of State (OES) 
- NOAA 
- UN Division of Ocean Affairs 
- University of Virginia, Department of Law of the Sea 
- University of Delaware, Marine Policy Program        (George 
Parsons) 
- Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute's Marine Policy Center (Andrew 
Solow) 
 
Possible dates: May - early September (up to 10 days) 
 
UNESCO would cover transportation costs to and from the United 
States.  Mission requests that ECA consider covering candidate's 
hotel and per diem expenses for the duration of her stay.
