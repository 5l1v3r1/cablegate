¶2. (U) On February 5, 2007, SCI officer spoke with Rachel Trajber, 
Coordinator of Environmental Education for the Brazilian Ministry of 
Education (MEC) and Brazil's future GLOBE country coordinator. 
Trajber said that MEC would prefer to hold a GLOBE signing ceremony 
(and related press event) as soon as possible in anticipation of the 
country-wide GLOBE launch and teacher training seminar in April 
¶2007.  Trajber indicated that MEC would like for Ambassador Sobel to 
sign the GLOBE agreement on behalf of the USG.  NASA International 
Programs Specialist, Michael Moore, also recently informed Post that 
NASA would prefer that Ambassador Sobel sign the GLOBE accord.

of the USG.  The text of the GLOBE agreement for review and 
clearance follows (a second version in Portuguese which was 
translated at the Foreign Service Institute's Office of Language 
Services has been sent to OES/SCT): 
 
"Agreement between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
of the United States of America and the Continued Education, 
Literacy and Diversity Secretariat of the Ministry of Education of 
the Federal Republic of Brazil for Cooperation in the GLOBE Program 
 
 
The GLOBE Program is an international environmental science and 
education program that brings students, teachers, and scientists 
together to study the global environment.  GLOBE has created an 
international network of students at primary, middle and secondary 
school levels studying environmental issues, making environmental 
measurements, and sharing useful environmental data with one another 
and the international science community. 
 
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the 
United States of America, and the Continued Education, Literacy and 
Diversity Secretariat of the Ministry of Education (SECAD/MEC) of 
the Federal Republic of Brazil (hereinafter referred to as "the 
Parties"): 
 
Intending to increase the awareness of students throughout the world 
about the global environment; 
 
Seeking to contribute to increased scientific understanding of the 
Earth; and 
 
Desiring to support improved student achievement in science and 
mathematics 
 
Have agreed to cooperate in the Global Learning and Observations to 
Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) Program as follows: 
 
ARTICLE 1 
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES 
 
NASA will use reasonable efforts to carry out the following 
responsibilities: 
 
¶1. Coordinate U.S. Government participation in the GLOBE Program, on 
behalf of relevant U.S. Government Agencies; 
 
¶2. Identify U.S. schools that will participate in the GLOBE 
Program; 
 
¶3. Select, in consultation with international scientists and 
educators, the GLOBE environmental measurements and define 
specifications for measurement equipment; 
 
¶4. Coordinate with the National Science Foundation (NSF) all 
activities related to new and existing GLOBE environmental 
measurements; 
 
¶5. Develop, in consultation with international scientists and 
educators, GLOBE educational materials; 
 
¶6. Translate GLOBE instructional materials related to measurement 
procedures and data reporting protocols into the six United Nations 
languages, and provide a copy of these plus all broader GLOBE 
educational materials to the Brazilian Party for further 
reproduction as necessary; 
 
¶7. Conduct regional training sessions for GLOBE Country Coordinators 
and GLOBE teachers who will serve as trainers for additional GLOBE 
 
BRASILIA 00000239  002 OF 003 
 
 
teachers in Brazil; 
 
¶8. Design, develop, operate, and maintain GLOBE data processing 
capabilities and other necessary technology and equipment; 
 
¶9. Provide GLOBE software, as necessary, for use on Brazil's GLOBE 
school computers (to the extent possible, textual material appearing 
on computer screens will be accessible in the student's choice among 
the six United Nations languages); 
 
¶10. Accept environmental data reported from GLOBE schools around the 
world, and develop and provide resultant global environmental images 
to the Brazilian Party; and 
 
¶11. Evaluate the overall GLOBE Program periodically, in consultation 
with international GLOBE Country Coordinators, and modify the 
overall program as appropriate. 
 
SECAD/MEC will use reasonable efforts to carry out the following 
responsibilities: 
 
¶1. Identify schools in Brazil that will participate in the GLOBE 
Program and provide an updated list of Brazil's GLOBE schools to the 
U.S. Party at the beginning of each school year; 
 
¶2. Ensure that Brazil's GLOBE schools conduct the fundamental 
activities of GLOBE schools (take GLOBE environmental measurements, 
report data, and receive and use resultant global environmental 
images, using GLOBE educational materials under the guidance of 
teachers trained to conduct the GLOBE Program); 
 
¶3. Name a Brazilian Government Point of Contact responsible for 
policy-level communications with the Director of the GLOBE Program; 
 
¶4. Name a Country Coordinator responsible for day-to-day management, 
oversight, and facilitation of the GLOBE Program in Brazil; 
 
¶5. Ensure that the Country Coordinator and some GLOBE teachers 
attend GLOBE regional training and in turn provide GLOBE training to 
at least one teacher in each Brazil GLOBE school; 
 
¶6. Ensure that GLOBE instructional materials related to measurement 
procedures and data reporting protocols are utilized in Brazil's 
GLOBE schools, and that broader GLOBE educational materials are 
appropriately translated, adapted, reproduced, and distributed to 
all Brazil's GLOBE schools; 
 
¶7. Ensure that the measurement equipment used by GLOBE schools to 
take GLOBE environmental measurements meets GLOBE specifications; 
 
¶8. Ensure that teachers and students at Brazil's GLOBE schools 
calibrate GLOBE measurement equipment according to procedures 
provided in GLOBE instructional materials; 
 
¶9. Ensure that Brazil's GLOBE schools have the necessary computer 
and communications systems to allow Internet/World Wide Web access 
in order to report GLOBE environmental measurements and to receive 
and use GLOBE environmental images; if such computer and 
communications systems are not available in Brazil's schools, make 
agreed alternative arrangements for such reporting and receipt (at a 
minimum, the Brazilian Country Coordinator will need access to the 
Internet so that all measurement data from Brazil's GLOBE schools 
will be reported via Internet); and 
 
¶10.  Evaluate GLOBE operations in Brazil periodically and assist the 
U.S. Party in conducting periodic evaluation of the overall GLOBE 
Program.
