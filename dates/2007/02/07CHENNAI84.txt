¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Elias Sait, Secretary General of the Seafood 
Exporters Association of India (SEAI), contends that the imposition 
of U.S. anti-dumping duties on Indian shrimp and subsequent U.S. 
Customs and Border Protection (CBP) bond requirements have reduced 
the number of seafood exporters to the U.S.  Limited access to the 
U.S. market has depressed producer prices (while consumer prices in 
India have remained steady) and impacted a large number of Indian 
shrimp fishers and farmers.  In order to cover lost sales and stay 
in business, small Indian shrimp operations are increasingly focused 
on alternate markets.  In 2006, Europe and Japan overtook the United 
States as the principal markets for Indian shrimp exporters.  Yet, 
SEAI remains hopeful that in due time the customs bond requirement 
and eventually the dumping duties will be removed by the U.S.  End 
Summary 
 
DROP IN SHRIMP EXPORTS, SELLERS CLOSE SHOP 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (SBU) In a meeting with us to review the impact of the customs 
bond and anti-dumping duty requirements on Indian shrimp exporters, 
Sait emphasized that shrimp exports to the U.S. have plummeted.  He 
explained that the countervailing duty (CVD) has affected shrimp 
prices and diminished producer prices while consumer prices have 
more or less remained steady.  The CVD, combined with the subsequent 
bond requirement, has "really killed" about 60 to 70 percent of 
small to medium exporters who lack the liquidity to absorb the 
additional cost.  According to SEAI, the number of company exporters 
fell from 130 in 2004, just before the dumping duties were 
introduced, to 66 in 2006.  Particularly hard hit are the small 
exporting companies who, lacking sufficient liquid assets, found it 
difficult to comply with the additional bond requirement.  Forced to 
choose between recovering losses or closing shop, the small to 
medium exporters started to concentrate on alternate markets. 
 
... AND WORKERS LOSE JOBS 
------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) According to SEAI, which represents the majority of seafood 
exporters in India, the losses to shrimp exporters dampened producer 
prices and thereby impacted approximately two million Indian workers 
involved in shrimp capture, farming, and processing. Neither the 
national or state governments have provided any aid to those 
affected, Sait asserted. However, in the past, fisheries experts 
have claimed that a drop in shrimp catch sizes along with stagnant 
productivity at farms ensured price stability (ref B). 
 
SO EXPORTERS EXTEND TO OTHER MARKETS 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶4. (SBU) Europe and Japan have now emerged as the largest export 
markets for Indian shrimp.  Europe's share of Indian shrimp exports 
has increased from 20 percent in 2004 to 33 percent in 2006, while 
Japan's share increased from 18 percent to 23 percent during the 
same period.  In comparison, the U.S. share of Indian seafood 
exports (including shrimp and other products) fell from 30 percent 
in 2004 to 22 percent in 2006.  Sait said that the rapid expansion 
into the European and Japanese markets is particularly remarkable 
given their strict phytosanitary (SPS) requirements.  The Marine 
Products Export Development Agency (MPEDA), an agency under the 
Government of India's Ministry of Commerce and Industry, has helped 
facilitate small exporters' entry into the European and Japanese 
markets by providing soft loans and training to undertake hazard 
analysis and pathogen reduction measures. 
 
¶5. (SBU) COMMENT:  SEASI remains hopeful that at least the bonding 
issue will be resolved following the favorable December 15, 2006 
ruling by the U.S. Court of International Trade. Meanwhile, Indian 
shrimp exporters who have settled with U.S. shrimpers or have been 
forced to close down due to the dumping duties and bond requirements 
see little reason to celebrate.
