Ref: A) STATE 14071    B) 16917 
 
(U) On February 12, we delivered reftel points to 
Marin Mottus, MFA Director for Middle East Affairs, 
concerning the implementation of UN Security Council 
Resolution (UNSCR) 1737.  As Estonia has no diplomatic 
presence in Tehran or in the region, the Government of 
Estonia (GOE) has supported the EU Troika's (Germany, 
France, and the UK) lead and commensurate EU 
pronouncements.  In this vein, the MFA thanked us for 
the USG's position, and took on board our points 
without further comment.
