END SUMMARY 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
ERADICATION WAITING FOR POLICE REORGANIZATION 
--------------------------------------------- 

¶2. (U)  The 2007 Eradication Plan was signed by Minister of 
Interior Pilar Mazzetti on January 11.  Eradication 
operations did not begin on January 8 as planned and have yet 
to start due to the ongoing reorganization of the police. 
CORAH is ready to eradicate at a moment's notice, once the 
police arrive. 
 
¶3. (U)  As part of its review of CORAH operations, NAS has 
instituted a new salary scale to rationalize the system for 
pay raises, promotions and time in service.  This effort will 
reduce personnel costs and guarantee that more funds are 
directed toward operations.  Congress is debating a new labor 
law that, if approved, could affect CORAH's ability to hire 
and fire workers, among other things.  We are monitoring the 
progress of the law and are analyzing the possible impacts 
once the new law is approved. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
NAS AND USAID DIRECTORS PRESENT 2007 PLANS TO GOP 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 

¶4. (U)  NAS Director Susan Keogh and USAID Director Paul 
Weisenfeld presented a comprehensive overview of the US 
Mission's planned 2007 anti-drug projects to DEVIDA Executive 
President Romulo Pizarro and his senior staff on January 22. 
The Embassy presentation followed a similar one by DEVIDA a 
week earlier on its 2007-2011 National Drug Strategy.  These 
efforts portend much closer and more frequent consultations 
between the GOP and the US Mission on anti-drug programs in 
¶2007. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
NAS AND USAID COORDINATE TO ENSURE COCA-FREE ZONES 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 

¶5. (U)  NAS and USAID continue close coordination on 
Programmed and Voluntary Eradication activities.  We have a 
joint plan to start Programmed Eradication in Santa Lucia and 
to have "token" eradication in the Campo Verde/Aguaytia area 
with a small number of police and eradicators to give an 
incentive to more communities to sign up with the alternative 
development program and to estimate the amount of coca in 
these areas. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
MAZZETTI SURVIVES RESIGNATION OF TOP AIDES 
------------------------------------------- 

¶6. (SBU)  Pilar Mazzetti has survived as Minister of Interior 
despite the recent high-profile resignation of Vice Minister 
Dardo Lopez-Dolz, a friend and ally of Mazetti.  On January 
19, the Lima dailies reported the resignation of Lopez-Dolz 
and several other Ministry advisors - he claimed over 
disagreements on operational and administrative decisions. 
Subsequent press reports indicated "irregularities" over 
contracting.  Over the past month, Mazzetti has pushed 
through substantial changes in the Peruvian National Police 
leadership and has survived challenges to her own stewardship 
of the Ministry.  Mazzetti met with President Garcia January 
20 after which Garcia declared his support for her "for now." 
 PM Jorge del Castillo also threw in his support, calling the 
matter a "10 minute crisis" that would be forgotten as soon 
as a vice-ministerial replacement was named (Ref A).  At 
month's end, there was still no replacement. 
 
------------------------------------ 
EMBASSY MEETS WITH COCALERO LEADERS 
------------------------------------ 

¶7. (SBU)  Post hosted 48 cocalero leaders on January 18, 
including seven mayors and Nelson Palomino, head of a large 
cocalero federation.  The tone of the meeting was open and 
civil.  The cocaleros main assertions were: extreme poverty 
plagues their communities and coca is one of their few 
profitable agricultural commodities; foreign aid has been 
poorly managed in the field; municipalities, not NGOs, should 
be the development implementers; and cocaleros are not 
narcotraffickers.  The representatives came from the Apurimac 
and Ene River Valley (VRAE) and requested a meeting with the 
Embassy during their 2-day trip to Lima to meet with GOP 
officials on the VRAE Plan.  While Palomino and his group 
took a more moderate stance than usual during the meetings, 
given his past radical, pro-coca and anti-U.S. statements, it 
is doubtful this will continue (see Ref B). 
 
--------------------------------------- 
PNP HAS NEW LEADERS AND NEW TECHNOLOGY 
--------------------------------------- 

¶8. (U)  Interdiction operations in the VRAE and Upper 
Huallaga are on hold because of the police reorganization. 
The PNP's Special Operations Office in Lima installed a new 
mapping system (ARGIS) that will use GPS data and satellite 
imagery to create accurate maps of coca regions.  This new 
technology will facilitate the gathering of intelligence 
information on narcotrafficking. 
 
¶9. (U) The official lists of the new PNP generals and command 
structure are out, but there are still delays in assigning 
mid-level officers.  General David RODRIGUEZ Segeu is the new 
Director General of the PNP and General Miguel HIDALGO Medina 
is assuming command of DIRANDRO.  The two met with NAS 
Director Susan Keogh to discuss the goals and priorities for 
this year's interdiction and eradication operations, which 
are expected to begin in early February.  See Ref A for brief 
bios of the Generals. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
LULL IN OPERATIONS ALLOWS AVIATION TIME FOR TRAINING 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 

¶10. (U)  NAS has been taking advantage of the slow operations 
tempo to conduct training in Pucallpa.  Night-vision-goggle 
refresher training and the DynCorp Instructor Pilot (IP) 
qualification training for four DIRAVPOL pilots are under 
way.  For the first time, maintenance test pilot 
qualification training for pilots is being conducted by a 
DIRAVPOL Maintenance Evaluator (ME).  NAS is moving more 
responsibility to DIRAVPOL flight crews as part of our 
nationalization plan. 
 
¶11. (U)  On January 12, General Richard Benavides assumed 
command of the Peruvian Air Police (DIRAVPOL).  He is not an 
aviator, so NAS is considering sending him to the Aviation 
Commander's course at HAI in Titusville, Florida. 
 
¶12. (U)  NAS hired a contractor to inspect the DIRAVPOL-owned 
Cessna 210 and its twin-engine Islander (both with piston 
engines) to determine the cost to make them flyable.  If the 
cost is reasonable, NAS will sign an agreement with DIRAVPOL 
to station the aircraft at the police bases in Santa Lucia 
and Mazamari/Palmapampa.  The aircraft would support CN 
administrative flights, command and control, medevacs, radio 
relays, and road reconnaissance.  These light fixed-wing 
aircraft will save helicopter flight hours--a significant 
cost saving.  Fuel and maintenance will be provided by 
DIRAVPOL.  In addition, NAS is investigating the different 
type of cameras that can be mounted in the FAP C-26 aircraft. 
 One C-26 now has a FLIR installed, but after 18 months of 
experience operating the C-26s in Peru, it is clear that we 
also need a camera to photograph CN target areas. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
NEW SCANNERS DELIVERED AND OFFSHORE PATROLS START 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 

¶13. (U)  New container x-ray scanners are installed and 
operational in the Port of Callao and in the northern port of 
Paita.  Peruvian Customs have almost fulfilled their 
self-imposed staffing obligations for 24/7 operations in 
Callao and 16/7 operations in Paita.  This, coupled with the 
export control system recently enacted by Peruvian Customs, 
brings export security in Peru to an all-time high. 
Officials seized 102 kg of cocaine HCl at the Lima airport 
this month.  In addition, NAS Lima is partnering with DEA 
Lima on maritime and aviation offshore patrols of the 
northern Peruvian coast in an attempt to interdict drugs 
leaving Peru by fishing vessels.  These patrols will be timed 
to coincide with the DEA "Operation ALL INCLUSIVE" and would 
be the first-ever such USG-sponsored operation in Peru in the 
maritime arena. 
 
¶14. (U)  The joint Customs-Police-NAS Manifest Review Unit 
(MRU) received an award from the International Law 
Enforcement Officers Association. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
NAS IS CREATING NEW ANTI-DRUG COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGY 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 

¶15. (U)  NAS is working with the "Alliance for a Drug-Free 
Peru" (Alianza) to develop a nationwide communications 
strategy, based on social marketing principles, that will be 
used by all NAS-funded demand reduction NGOs.  Advertising 
and marketing professionals, who are members of Alianza, will 
use existing research, key informants, and focus groups to 
create a coherent set of messages with phrases, slogans, and 
images that can be used to direct drug prevention messages to 
audiences of all ages and at all socioeconomic levels. 
Alianza is a private sector-led NGO that provides this 
professional service at no charge.  TV and radio spots will 
be created as well as other media such as posters, banners, 
pamphlets, and flyers.  NAS will fund some of the production 
and distribution costs. 
 
¶16. (U)  The communications campaign will support NAS's main 
demand reduction strategy of community anti-drug coalitions. 
The six coalitions are now expanding the areas they serve and 
are raising their visibility in order to create a 
constituency that supports anti-drug and 
anti-narcotrafficking strategies.  NAS has reorganized its 
external evaluation team to also provide counsel on ways to 
build capacity and develop sustainability. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
OAS/CICAD AND NAS OFFER MONEY LAUNDERING TRAINING 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 

¶17. (U)  OAS/CICAD and NAS joined forces to offer money 
laundering training.  Two CICAD money laundering experts 
visited Lima the week of January 22 at the invitation of NAS 
to assess opportunities for offering training courses in 
money laundering issues, and other programs.  NAS arranged 
meetings for the visitors with senior GOP officials including 
the Attorney General, the President of the Supreme Court, the 
new head of the Peruvian drug police, and the Director of 
Peru's Financial Intelligence Unit.  As a result of this 
visit, NAS is advancing plans to fund a number of 
CICAD-provided training courses in Peru in 2007.
