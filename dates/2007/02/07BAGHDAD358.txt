¶2. In compiling this list, post considered a number of women in 
business, politics, and civil society.  Most of the businesswomen 
who were considered are currently residents of Jordan, having fled 
violence and in many cases, specific threats against their lives. 
Unfortunately there are no outstanding women in the Iraqi media at 
present, with female politicians rather than journalists dominating 
the airwaves.  Although there are many outstanding women working in 
civil society organizations, post is unsure of how truly influential 
they are in society as a whole.  The fact that post's list includes 
3 members of parliament and a minister highlights the extent to 
which Iraqi society is still dominated by a top-down mentality. 
 
¶3. This exercise also raised interesting questions about the role of 
sectarianism in the women's movement in Iraq.  When discussing the 
issue of influential women with Iraqi contacts, poloffs received 
greatly varying answers from members of different religious and 
ethnic groups.  Poloffs also noted that many women who emboffs 
believe to be influential and who routinely meet with high level US 
officials, were not necessarily perceived as having great influence 
within Iraq.  Post intends to expand upon these issues in a later 
cable.
