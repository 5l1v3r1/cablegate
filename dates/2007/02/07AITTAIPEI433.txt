¶1.  (SBU) AIT Director Young spoke with Vice Premier Tsai 
Ying-wen on February 26 to convey reftel points in paras 
6-12.  In response, Tsai confirmed that Taiwan had contracted 
U.S. counsel to advise them on the case, but now that it into 
legal proceedings, Taiwan has respected the independence of 
the courts and is not trying to intervene or influence the 
legal process in any way.  The Vice Premier expressed 
appreciation for this information, which she said would 
provide a useful reminder to all elements of the Taiwan 
government involved in the case, including MOJ and the TECRO 
office in Washington.  Tsai promised to pass on the USG 
points in that spirit.  Director indicated that our 
information from Washington suggests TECRO is already well 
aware of the sensitivities involved.  He conveyed to Tsai our 
appreciation for their understanding and cooperation. 
Director also reminded the Vice Premier that Taiwan 
authorities should continue supplying any relevant 
information, either on Mr. Wang or his spouse, through the 
MOF-DOJ channel.  Tsai pledged to consult with MOJ promptly 
to ensure this process continues.  She expressed genuine 
appreciation for our updates.  Taking advantage of a call 
from FM James Huang later in the day, Director went over 
these points again, highlighting the importance of 
forbearance on the part of Taiwan at this state.  Huang said 
he fully understood, and that my points tracked closely with 
information they had received from David Lee in TECRO. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Separately on February 26, MOJ Prosecutor Huang 
Yuang-kuang expressed thanks for and understanding of reftel 
information and told AIT that Taiwan had not yet made any 
request under the MLAA specifically for information related 
to Wang's bulk cash smuggling and trans-national money 
laundering operations.  AIT noted that if Taiwan authorities 
wish to make a specific request for information related to 
these crimes, they should do so under the MLAA.
