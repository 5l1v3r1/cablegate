¶1. (U) Summary: On February 13, International Cooperation 
Minister Verner announced that Canada is committing C$13 
million over five years to fund an umbrella project to 
support displaced populations and home communities in Sudan's 
disputed regions of Abyei, South Kordofan and Blue Nile.  End 
Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) According to the Canadian International Development 
Agency (CIDA), this project is aimed at supporting the 
Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), that brought to an end 
decades of civil war and reinforcing the ability of 
communities in the affected regions to receive and integrate 
displaced populations and to protect the most vulnerable, 
including children.  The CPA project includes initiatives 
aimed at responding to the needs of the population in these 
areas. 
 
¶3. (U) The Canadian funding will be allocated as follows: 
-- C$2.06 million, over two years, to Save the Children 
Canada to promote the return and reintegration of displaced 
persons to their home villages by increasing access to clean 
water and sanitation, as well as creating income generating 
activities; 
-- C$2 million to the United Nations Mine Action Service for 
demining the main routes in the disputed regions; 
-- C$2.8 million for UNICEF to increase access to basic 
education for girls and boys aged 6-13 and to improve 
teaching materials, as well as to help alleviate the affects 
of violence, abuse and neglect on some 200,000 war-affected 
children; 
-- C$2.04 million to Emmanuel Relief and Rehabilitation 
International of Canada, associated with Serving in Mission 
Canada, to help 30 communities in the disputed regions with 
improved water, sanitation and health services. 
 
¶4. (U) The remaining C$4 million will be allocated as the 
situation evolves.  The new contribution supplements the 
C$110 million in humanitarian, reconstruction and 
reintegration funding that Canada has contributed since April 
2005 to alleviate the suffering of Sudanese affected by 
conflict.
