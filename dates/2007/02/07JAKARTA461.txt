SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR'S FAREWELL CALL ON JAKARTA GOVERNOR SUTIYOSO 
 
¶1. On February 16, Ambassador Pascoe, accompanied by DCM and 
Management Counselor, paid his farewell call on Jakarta Governor 
Sutiyoso.  Sutiyoso was joined by several staff members including 
his senior advisors on land issues from the historical preservation, 
city planning and zoning offices. 
 
¶2. The Ambassador thanked the Governor for his support over the past 
two-plus years and the professionalism of his team, and asked for 
his continued support of the Embassy's New Embassy Compound 
proposal.  Governor Sutiyoso advised that his staff had nearly 
completed its review of our building proposals and would soon advise 
of his office's approval in principle of our requests.  He said he 
did not see any major issues that would get in the way of his 
approval. 
 
¶3. The Governor then turned to the recent flooding in Jakarta, and 
related that in light of the 13 rivers running into Jakarta, flood 
control should be the responsibility of the central government.  He 
said that after the flooding of 2002 he had raised the issue of 
flood control, but complained that the central government had not 
taken his concerns seriously.  Now, though, he said the government 
is paying attention.  The Governor expressed his concerns that 
sanitation and health problems are the next phase of the flooding 
situation, and called on businesses and the international community, 
specifically the UN, to assist.
