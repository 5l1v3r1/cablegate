"The Guarantor of Chvez, Morales And Correa" 
 
Economic columnist Rolf Kuntz commented in center-right O Estado de 
Â¶S. Paulo (2/1): "President Lula assumed in Davos the role of 
political guarantor of South American neighbors. He should not have 
done that, and by doing so he contrasted with Mexican President 
Felipe Calderon Hinojosa, who insists on keeping distance from 
governments he described as aspirants to lifelong dictatorships.... 
By assuming the condition of guarantor, President Lula once again in 
his generosity forgot to consult the partners he supports.... Less 
than a week after Lula's words in Davos, the Venezuelan Congress 
completed the approval of the so-called, Ley Habilitante, the law 
that gives exceptional powers to President Hugo Chvez to rule. No 
democratic government enjoys similar powers.... With such provisions 
attributed to Chvez by a Congress that is completely under his 
control, the president will hardly have any limits to his 
arbitrariness. Unless he commits an act of violence unacceptable 
even his most enthusiastic followers, he will consolidate an 
autocratic system of government."
