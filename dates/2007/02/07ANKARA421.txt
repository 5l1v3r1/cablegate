¶1. We delivered reftel demarche jointly with Italian PolCouns 
Lucio Demichele on February 22 to Gulin Dinc, Head of 
Department, MFA International Political Organizations.  We 
emphasized that the program was designed for training of 
trainers and that we would be prepared to send a joint 
U.S.-Italian Mobile Assistance Team to Turkey to explain the 
program in detail upon confirmation of GOT interest.  We 
suggested the May 7 course start date for middle managers and 
the May 21 date for senior level trainers. 
 
¶2. Dinc was familiar with the program objectives from the 
non-paper drawn from reftel we had previously provided to 
MFA.  She expressed appreciation for the invitations and 
promised to elicit an early confirmation of interest from the 
Turkish National Police (TNP) and Turkish Jandarma.
