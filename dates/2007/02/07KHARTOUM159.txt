Office of the Spokesperson 
 
Press Release No. 04/07 
 
 
The UN Condemns the Killing of a Civilian Police Monitor of the 
African Union Mission in Sudan 
 
1 February, Khartoum:  The United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) 
strongly condemns the killing of a member of Civilian Police of the 
African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) who was shot dead today by 
unknown armed men during a hijacking of an AMIS vehicle inside 
Kassab camp in Kutum, North Darfur. 
 
UNMIS extends its condolences to the family of the victim and to the 
African Union Mission in Sudan. 
 
UNMIS urges all parties to fully cooperate with AMIS and to ensure 
the safety and security of its personnel. UNMIS requests the release 
of the AMIS peacekeeper abducted on 10 December 2006 and handover of 
all AMIS vehicles hijacked. 
 
UNMIS is particularly alarmed at the fact that the killing happened 
inside an IDP camp and urges all concerned to prevent the presence 
and access of armed individuals to camps.

¶3. (SBU) Comment:  Vehicle thefts, often accompanied by deadly 
force, continue in Darfur, whether for service as armed vehicles 
("technicals"), smuggling, trade, or transport.  Combined with a 
general trend in violence directed toward AMIS troops, this attack 
underscores an increasingly insecure environment in much of North 
Darfur.  It is likely that this incident will be investigated 
following an upcoming Cease-fire Commission meeting.
