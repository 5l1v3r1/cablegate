¶1.  (C) Summary:  The GNZ understands the pressures for more 
resources in Afghanistan and will review carefully our 
request for additional NATO/ISAF commitments.  Current NZ 
Defence Force (NZDF) deployments to Afghanistan will likely 
be extended through September 2009, but GNZ will probably not 
increase its commitments, either for the operational needs 
cited reftel or for a new Special Forces redeployment.  The 
Ministry of Defence says it cannot offer more because NZDF 
needs to be able to maintain its forces in the Solomons and 
in  E.Timor.  Australia has asked New Zealand to take on more 
of the burden in Timor, to help enable Australia to cover its 
efforts elsewhere.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (C) On February 14, Pol-Econ Couns and DATT met with 
Deputy Defence Secretary Chris Seed to discuss reftel request 
for further contributions to Afghanistan and NATO-ISAF.  Seed 
said our request was not unexpected.  Over the past months, 
senior NATO officials and  NATO member leaders have made more 
general requests to PM Clark, Defence Minister Goff, and 
Foreign Minister Peters.  NATO SG de Joop Scheffer also 
raised the issue during Minister Goff's January visit to 
Europe.  Canada and the UK have made specific requests for NZ 
contributions to their own operations in Afghanistan, and New 
Zealand Embassy officials have attended briefings at the 
State Department.  Seed said that as a result of these 
conversations, the GNZ fully understands the pressures ISAF 
is facing.  He promised to formally submit the list to 
Defence Minister Goff and senior Defence and Foreign Ministry 
officials, and said they would review it carefully. 
 
¶3.  (C) Seed said that he expects that GNZ Ministers will 
within the next few weeks agree  to extend NZDF's PRT 
deployment to September 2009, from its current mandate of 
September 2007.  It is also likely the Ministers will extend 
NZDF's other commitments, including  ISAF HQ liaisons, 
logistics assistance, and training for Afghan army and 
police.  It is not/not likely the GNZ can commit any new 
assets this year, particularly Special Forces, given NZDF's 
commitments in the Solomon Islands and E. Timor.  Seed said 
it appears especially likely that NZDF will need to remain in 
Timor at least through 2008, given the situation on the 
ground there.  Australia has also asked NZDF to take on more 
of the Coalition Task Force burden in Timor, to enable the 
Australians to cover their contributions elsewhere. 
 
¶4.  (C) This is the longest extension of an NZDF deployment 
to Afghanistan since the war began.  (The last extension was 
for eighteen months.)  Seed says this is because the GNZ 
wants to demonstrate its clear commitment to Afghanistan.  In 
addition, the next New Zealand general election will likely 
be held in late 2008, and the extra time will enable the new 
Government to avoid having to make a hasty decision about 
whether or not to extend the deployment again. 
 
 
¶5.  (C) Emboffs will also discuss reftel request with working 
level contacts at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade 
and Ministry of Defence.
