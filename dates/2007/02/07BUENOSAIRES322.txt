the upcoming March 13-15 meeting of the Interpol Executive Committee 
that will determine whether "Red Notices" will be issued for eight 
former Iranian government officials and one Lebanese Hizballah 
member accused of involvement in the bombing.  He stressed the fight

that the GOA needed USG support to ensure success in the March 
Interpol proceedings.

penetration' of radical Islamic ideology in Latin America and the 
need for USG involvement if the region was to live in peace and not 
under a constant terrorist threat.  Dr. Angel Shindel, the President

well to Ambassador Wayne for bringing such high level USG attention 
to the cause of the AMIA bombings. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Both U/S Burns and A/S Shannon expressed their sympathy for 
the victims of the bombing. U/S Burns noted the USG's shared 
experience with terrorism at the hand of Iran, while A/S Shannon

posed to all pluralist and tolerant societies.  They reiterated the 
USG's strong support for Argentina's pursuit of justice in the case. 
   U/S Burns laid wreaths at memorials commemorating the victims of 
the 1994 bombing, the 1992 bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos 
Aires, and for Jewish victims of the 1976-83 military dictatorship.
