Classified By: DCM MICHAEL MATERA FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
 
1.(U)  This is an action request.  See para 3. 
 
¶2.  (C)  On February 9, Under Secretary for Political Affairs 
Nicolas Burns delivered reftel points to Argentine Foreign 
Minister Taiana.  FM Taiana stated that the GOA would need 
time to review the initiative before determining whether it 
will sign on to the principles, and participate in, the 
initiative.  Later on February 9, the DCM spoke with 
Ambassador Elsa Kelly, Director of the MFA office of 
International Security and Nuclear and Space Issues, who 
noted with interest the invitation to the GOA to join the 
initiative and promised to review the non-paper which had 
been left with the MFA. 
 
¶3.  (C)  Given the urgent nature of the demarche, post was 
unable to coordinate with the Russian Embassy.  Post and the 
Russian Embassy have agreed to follow up with the Argentine 
Foreign Ministry after the conclusion of the February 12-13 
meeting on the Global Nuclear Terrorism Initiative in Ankara. 
 Post requests that the Department provide a readout soonest 
of the Ankara meeting that may be shared with the GOA.
