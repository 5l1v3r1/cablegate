SUBJECT:  Taiwan Merges Two State-owned Banks 
 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  Two state-owned enterprises, including the largest bank in 
Taiwan, will merge in July 2007.  The new entity will be Taiwan's 
largest financial holding company and its banking unit will have 
over 10% market share.  END SUMMARY. 
 
Two State-owned Enterprises 
--------------------------- 
 
¶2.  Taiwan's Ministry of Finance (MOF) recently announced that 
Central Trust of China (CTC) will merge into Bank of Taiwan (BOT) in 
July 2007.  Taiwan's Fair Trade Commission approved the merger plan 
in May 2006 and banking authorities granted permission in December 
¶2006.  In early January 2007, the Securities and Futures Bureau 
authorized BOT to issue new shares to replace CTC shares at a ratio 
of one BOT share for two CTC shares. 
 
¶3.  Currently, BOT is the largest bank in Taiwan.  It has market 
share of 9% in assets, 9% in deposits, and 8.5% in outstanding 
loans.  CTC ranks 36th in net worth and 26th in assets among 
Taiwan's 42 banks.  However, CTC is a giant in insurance.  CTC is 
the primary insurance provider for all Taiwan military personnel, 
public school faculties, and civil service employees.  It also 
conducts procurement for public agencies. 
 
Changes after Merger 
-------------------- 
 
¶4.  After the merger, the new banking unit will remain the largest 
bank in Taiwan, with market share of over 10%, total assets of 
NT$2.93 trillion (US$88.8 billion), deposits of NT$2.29 trillion 
(US$69.4 billion), and outstanding loans of NT$1.67 trillion 
(US$50.6 billion). 
 
¶5.  According to the MOF, BOT will transform itself into a financial 
holding company (FHC) after the merger.  CTC's non-banking 
departments will be reorganized as independent companies affiliated 
with the new FHC.  With the largest bank, the only insurance 
provider to public employees, and the major public procurement 
contractor, the new FHC will surpass Cathay as the largest one in 
Taiwan.
