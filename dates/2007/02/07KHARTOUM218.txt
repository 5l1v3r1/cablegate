SUBJECT:  Presidency Appoints Chair of Commission on Rights of 
Non-Muslims in National Capital 
 
Ref:  06 Khartoum 00774 
 
¶1. (U) On February 8, President al-Bashir issued a presidential 
decree, with the approval of First Vice President Salva Kiir, 
appointing Joshua Dao as Chair of the Commission on the Rights of 
Non-Muslims in the National Capital.  The membership of the 
Commission will be announced later by the Presidency. 
 
¶2. (U) The Commission - called for by the Comprehensive Peace 
Agreement and enshrined in the Interim National Constitution - was 
appointed by the Presidency to ensure that the rights of non-Muslims 
in Khartoum are protected, and not adversely affected by the 
application of Sharia law in the capital.  (Note:  This recalls the 
rancor over the Khartoum State constitution - see reftel - that 
arose early in 2006 when the SPLM and NCP disagreed over the status 
of Khartoum as a national capital or a northern state.  End note.) 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Comment:  Dao is a veteran politician from Southern Sudan, 
and was formerly a member of a minority, pro-National Congress 
Party, the Union of Sudan African Parties (USAP).  His appointment, 
and the anticipated operation of the Commission, marks an important 
step in the implementation of the CPA and in further guaranteeing 
religious freedom in Khartoum.  This commission was a key 
negotiating point for the SPLM during the lengthy North-South peace 
talks; it addresses the need for cultural space for the millions of 
transplanted Southerners living in the great Khartoum area.
