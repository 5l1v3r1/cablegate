¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information 
provided below is prohibited by Section 12C of the 
Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of 
the Office of Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the 
USDOC Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), 
Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) 
accompanied by Commercial Assistant Sandy Lai 
conducted a pre-license check (PLC) at Shiu Cheung 
Hardware Co. Ltd. 338-340 Lai Chi Kok Road, 
Kowloon, Hong Kong (Shiu Cheung Hardware).  The 
purpose of the PLC was to determine the 
suitability of Shiu Cheung Hardware to be the 
recipient of specialty aluminum rods (ECCN 1C202) 
valued at approximately USD 2 million.  The items 
are controlled for nuclear nonproliferation (NP) 
reasons. The license applicant is Hadco Metal 
Trading Co. LLC of Jamaica, New York (Hadco). 
 
¶3.  According to the Hong Kong Companies Registry, 
Shiu Cheung Hardware has been in existence since 
September 1995.   Five members of the Fung family 
(all Hong Kong residents) are listed as directors. 
The registered address is the primary business 
location of the company.  The share capital of the 
company is the Hong Kong equivalent of 
approximately USD 1.2 million. 
 
¶4.  On February 14, 2006, the ECO and Commercial 
Assistant visited Shiu Cheung Hardware at the 
address above and met with Mr. M. Fung, Managing 
Director and Director Stanley Fung.  Mr. M. Fung 
stated that Shiu Cheung Hardware is a trading 
company specializing in hardware, tools, steel and 
aluminum titanium alloys. Mr. M. Fung stated that 
the company has been in existence since 1964 
(though its marketing materials indicate that it 
has been incorporated under its present name since 
1996). 
 
¶5.  Mr. M. Fung stated that Shiu Cheung Hardware 
intends to purchase the aluminum rods that are 
subject of the check for stock to supply Shiu 
Cheng's usual customers.  Those customers 
typically purchase cut portions of the aluminum 
rods.  Mr. M. Fung produced various invoices for 
past transactions with Hong Kong based companies 
including ASM Asia Ltd. (www.asm.com) and Golden 
Casting Company (www.goldencasting.com.hk).  He 
stated that these rods are used primarily for 
casting purposes to make moldings for plastics and 
other applications.  He stressed that the 
customers for the aluminum rods are only in Hong 
Kong.  By way of an explanation, he stated that it 
is easier to collect payment from Hong Kong 
customers. 
 
¶6.  Messrs. Fung and Fung stated that they 
understood that these items should only be sold to 
legitimate end-users.  At the same time, it was 
clear that they were not familiar with U.S. export 
controls on the items nor were they familiar with 
comparable Hong Kong export control rules.  The 
ECO provided the Fungs with BIS information on 
reexport controls as well as contact information 
for the Trade and Industry Department in Hong 
Kong, which administers Hong Kong's export control 
system. 
 
¶7.  Based on the information in reftel A (namely 
that Shiu Cheung Hardware does not have a 
licensing history with BIS), it appears that the 
exporter (Hadco) may not have applied for export 
licenses in the past for shipments of comparable 
aluminum rods when such licenses may have been 
required.  The ECO recommends that BIS review its 
records and consider reaching out to Hadco on this 
matter. 
 
¶8.  Shiu Cheung Hardware was very forthcoming 
during the PLC visit.  Messrs. Fung and Fung 
provided information on the intended use of the 
items (distribution to customers in Hong Kong) as 
well as background on Shiu Cheung Hardware.  The 
 
 
ECO recommends that this PLC be considered 
Favorable.
