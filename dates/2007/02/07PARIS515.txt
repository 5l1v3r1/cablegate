¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  On February 1, 2007, Embassy FAS, Econ, Science 
and Regional Security Officers met with representatives of three 
U.S. companies involved in agricultural biotechnology in France: 
Monsanto, Dupont/Pioneer, Dow Agro-Sciences. The companies raised 
concerns about security conditions, i.e., increasing acts of 
vandalism, particularly in light of an expected regulation which 
could require French farmers to make public the location of their 
biotech plots.  They expressed concern about the slowness of the EU 
biotech approval process, and possible politicization of French 
regulatory decisions in the months leading up to the presidential 
election.  End Summary. 
 
Security 
-------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The three companies emphasized their concerns about the 
security of their information, property and staff, due to the annual 
destruction of two thirds of biotech test plots in France, 
demonstrations and attacks on their buildings and on a silo 
containing GM corn harvested in 2006 (Reftel).  Consequently, the 
companies loose money and data, while staff morale suffers. 
Monsanto and Pioneer said they systematically file complaints when 
their properties are destroyed. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The companies asked for Embassy support via communication 
with the French police services to make sure they treat announced 
acts of violence seriously, and via help in finding scientists 
willing to testify at trials.  Post Regional Security Officer (RSO) 
offered to help them bolster their prevention efforts, individually 
and/or collectively. RSO discussed OSAC (Overseas Security Advisory 
Council), encouraged the companies to participate in the France 
chapter and indicated a desire to include biotech-specific concerns 
in the next country council meeting. 
 
Potential New Requirement for Transparency on Biotech Crops Location 
 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Monsanto, Pioneer and Dow Agro Sciences expressed their 
concerns about a decree the GOF is expected to publish very shortly 
making available to the public the location of biotech crops.  The 
level of disclosure could be a municipality, but it is feared that 
names of individual farmers may be publicized. (Note:  While the EU 
Directive 2001/18 requires transparency, its level is up to each EU 
Member State. End Note.) While expectations were for a continuing 
increase in biotech plantings (from 500 hectares of GM corn in 2005, 
to 5,000 ha in 2006 and up to 50,000 ha in 2007), this new 
regulation is expected to slow down the adoption of biotech crops by 
French farmers if disclosure is at the farm level due to security 
fears. (Note : Emboffs have made representations on this issue, 
trying to discourage transparency at the farm level. End note) 
 
EC Approvals Process 
------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) The companies expressed frustration with the slow approvals 
process in Brussels, noting that despite EFSA approvals, DG 
Environment and SANCO kept presenting obstacles.  They inquired 
about USG followup in light of the WTO decision on EC biotech 
process. 
 
¶6. (SBU) With regard to France's influence on the process, the 
company reps felt that France's recent abstention on a BASF biotech 
potato event signaled a new reluctance by the GOF to vote in favor 
of new biotech varieties, particularly since France has had a fairly 
positive voting record and technical contacts had signaled that they 
didn't have any problems with the BASF dossier.  The U.S. companies 
are concerned about politicization of France's position in the 
months leading up to the French presidential election, particularly 
in view of the number and importance of products (currently 4 
Monsanto products and 1 Pioneer-Dow product) in the approval

pipeline.  The companies also fear that France's vote could 
influence other MS such as Portugal, and those which recently joined 
the EU. 
 
¶7. (SBU) The companies concluded that an interesting angle to argue 
for EU approval of their new products is that without these new 
approvals, increased quantities of agricultural commodities will 
enter Europe with the risk of containing GM products unauthorized in 
the EU, although authorized in the U.S. and other countries. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Comment:  With the presidential and parliamentary elections 
scheduled for the spring, the highly-charged political atmosphere in 
France does not bode well for either continuing adoption of approved 
varieties by farmers or French support for approval of new 
varieties.  End Comment.
