¶2.  THE WORLD  LARGEST LAND AND AIR DEFENSE ARMAMENT TRADE

SHOWCASE FOR THE BEST IN U.S. TECHNOLOGY.  DOD 
ENTHUSIASTIC AND SUCCESSFUL 
PRESENCE AT PREVIOUS EUROSATORY 
EXPOSITIONS ILLUSTRATES OUR COMMITMENT TO NATO AND 
COALITIONS AND DEMONSTRATES OUR CAPACITY FOR TECHNICAL AND 
MILITARY LEADERSHIP.  A STRONG AND OFFICIALLY SUPPORTED 
DISPLAY OF AMERICAN TECHNOLOGY IS A MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO 
COMMUNICATE OUR VOCATION TO LEADERSHIP IN DEFENSE ISSUES. 
¶3.  USG AND DOD PARTICIPATION IN THIS EVENT SUPPORTS THIS 
EMBASSY  MISSION PERFORMANCE PLAN BY ENHANCING BILATERAL 
AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS WITH KEY PARTNERS.  EUROSATORY 
STATISTICS FOR 2006 REFLECT THE TRULY INTERNATIONAL SCOPE 
OF THIS EVENT: SEVENTY PERCENT OF INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS 
(WHICH NUMBERED NEARLY 1200) AND FIFTY PERCENT OF VISITORS 
(FROM A TOTAL OF 48,000) WERE FROM OTHER COUNTRIES, AND

¶4.  AS THE REGIONAL COMBATANT COMMANDER, EUCOM  THEATER 
SECURITY COOPERATION PLAN IS EQUALLY SUPPORTED BY 
PARTICIPATION IN EUROSATORY.  OUR PRESENCE PROMOTES STRONG 
TIES TO CURRENT AND FUTURE ALLIES WHILE EMPHASIZING DOD 
COMMITMENT TO 
INTEROPERABILITY OF OUR RESPECTIVE ARMED 
FORCES. 
 
¶5.  THE U.S. EMBASSY IN PARIS STRONGLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE 
EQUIPMENT SELECTED FOR THE DOD CORRAL HAVE AS ITS FOCUS

¶6.  A STRONG DOD PRESENCE IN 2008 WILL CONFIRM THE U.S. AS 
THE STANDARD AGAINST WHICH ALLIANCE INTEROPERABILITY IS 
MEASURED AND SERVE AS A PLATFORM FOR PUBLIC DIPLOMACY. 
ADDITIONALLY, DOD PRESENCE SERVES AS AN INVITATION TO 
PURSUE TRANSATLANTIC ARMAMENTS COOPERATION AND SECURITY 
ASSISTANCE.  WITH THE ADVENT OF THE EUROPEAN DEFENSE AGENCY 
AND INCREASING CONCERNS OF A CLOSED EUROPEAN ARMS MARKET, 
U.S. PARTICIPATION IS ALL THE MORE ESSENTIAL. 
 
¶7.  U.S. EMBASSY PARIS CONSIDERS EUROSATORY 2008 AN 
EXEMPLARY OPPORTUNITY TO DEMONSTRATE VIA A STRATEGIC 
PARTICIPATION PLAN THAT THE UNITED STATES REMAINS COMMITTED 
TO LEADERSHIP IN ACHIEVING GLOBAL SECURITY AND STABILITY. 
I THEREFORE RECOMMEND DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROVAL 
FORFULL, DIRECT PARTICIPATION IN EUROSATORY 2008.
