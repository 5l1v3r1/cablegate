SUBJECT: GOSS BUDGET SHOWS NEED FOR DONOR ACTION

¶1. Summary: The GOSS 2007 Budget highlights the need for donor 
action to assist Southern Sudan with budgeting, civil service 
administration, and cash management in order to assure success of 
the CPA. The budget also exposes the problem of weak legislative 
oversight of the military. The GOSS needs to impose greater fiscal 
discipline. Donors should use the Sudan Consortium in late March, 
and any potential IGAD meeting in the near future, to coordinate 
assistance to the GOSS to address these issues. USAID is already 
providing technical assistance to the GOSS, but other donors need to 
come on board. End Summary. 
 
¶2.  The Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) seeks to make unity 
attractive to the South.  For this to happen, the GOSS must deliver 
a 'peace dividend' of improved infrastructure and government 
services.  The GOSS 2007 budget highlights several areas where the 
GOSS is facing substantial challenges accomplishing this. 
 
Transparency and Honesty 
------------------------- 
 
3.(SBU) The narrative portion of the GOSS budget furnishes honest 
statements of problems the GOSS faces. The GOSS needs to get a 
handle on these problems early on in order to make the CPA function 
as intended.  There are three especially important concerns: numbers 
of government personnel, cash management, and, military oversight. 
 
Government Employment 
--------------------- 
 
4.(SBU) In section 4.1 of the budget, the legislative assembly 
expressed concern about the projected personnel levels and the 
related salaries and wages.  The GOSS intends to reduce government 
personnel from 116,691 to 64,962 (a 44 percent reduction). But even 
with this decrease, expenses for salaries are projected to nearly 
triple from 2006 to 2007. Whether the planned decrease will occur 
remains to be seen. If a disproportionate part of the budget is 
taken for personnel costs, less is available for investment in 
infrastructure. Ideally, the budget should be compiled in a way that 
budgets both number of positions and dollars. Each Ministry should 
have a ceiling on positions, and the dollar budget should be linked 
to that number. 
 
Cash Management Needs Strengthening 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶5. (SBU) For 2007, projections are that the GOSS will receive 
roughly USD 1 billion in oil revenues and another USD 1.4 billion in 
non-oil revenues will flow through the GOSS to the 10 southern 
states. The budget makes numerous references to reserves, bank 
accounts, transfers and so forth, yet overall, the budget does not 
evidence a coordinated control of these funds.  Projected 2007 
revenues are USD 160 million less than expenditures, yet the budget 
does not mention borrowing. However recent reports in the press 
state that the GOSS will borrow USD 250 million from Emirates Bank. 
The current arrangements do not seem to provide sufficient 
oversight. Donors should address the question of how to work with 
the GOSS to improve cash management. 
 
Legislative Oversight of Military Lacking 
------------------------------------------ 
 
6.(SBU) In section 4.1.1 of the budget, the legislative assembly 
bluntly stated, "As the military needs are much larger than our 
budget could provide, Southern Sudan Legislative Assembly therefore, 
urges the Commander in Chief of the SPLA to SOLICIT further 
resources from friendly nations to meet the SPLA needs."  This is 
effectively an instruction to the military to seek off-budget, 
non-legislated funding.  It removes legislative oversight from the 
budget of the military.  Successful implementation of the CPA 
requires that the legislative assembly play a proper oversight role. 
 
 
¶7. (U) Action Request: The Sudan Consortium, scheduled for March 
20-21, and a possible IGAD meeting (ref A) provide an opportunity to 
strengthen the CPA. USAID is already working to address the problems 
cited in paras 4 and 5 by providing technical assistance to the GOSS 
Ministry of Finance and committees of the Southern Sudan Assembly. 
Other donors should be brought onboard and push for the GOSS to 
impose greater fiscal discipline. Specific actions should include 
getting agreement from other donors for the GOSS to adopt a 
transparent, non-chapter budget, and to work with the Ministry of 
Finance to impose discipline in cash management. Embassy requests 
that the Department incorporate these topics into preparations for 
the upcoming meetings.
