¶1.  This cable is in response to reftel from January 18, 2007.  The 
Regional Environmental Affairs Officer (Hub) for South America is 
requesting inclusion in PE 142, Resource Economics, to take place in 
Washington, DC and Denver, Colorado from July 9-13. 
 
¶2.  As South American Hub officer, this office is charged with 
looking at environmental issues of a regional nature that have broad 
impacts and implications throughout the continent.  The majority of 
the South American economies continue to rely on extractive 
industries such as mining as the primary drivers for their 
economies.  The environmental impacts of these extractive practices, 
and the political fall-out as well, have been seen throughout the 
region.  For example, gas pipelines in Peru, gold mining in the 
Amazon, and natural gas and other minerals mining in Bolivia, Chile, 
Colombia, Ecuador, have all shown the inextricable links between 
these economic practices and politics and the environment. 
Understanding the primary economic principles behind these 
activities will help us frame our environmental efforts in a way 
that supports the development of these resources in a sustainable 
way while also giving this office the tools necessary to support 
efforts by the US Geological Survey and other actors in the sector. 
 
 
¶3.  The Hub officer has scheduled his R&R travel around the dates of 
this training and therefore can route his travel through Washington 
to his R&R point in order to save travel funds.  Current tour of 
duty for the Hub is through September, 2008.  Contact information 
for Hub officer James Story is storyjb@state.gov, telephone IVG 921 
extension 7417 or direct at 55-61-3312-7417, fax 55-61-3312-7668.
