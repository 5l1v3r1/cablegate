SUBJECT:  CONFERENCE ON INTERNALLY DISPLACED 
PERSONS IN IRAQI KURDISTAN 
 
This is an Iraqi Kurdistan Regional Reconstruction Team (RRT) cable. 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  RRT Offs participated in the Coordination 
Meeting for Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) in Sulaimaniyah 
Province in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region to determine information that 
will help identify and assist IDPs.  The IDP population includes 
Iraqi Arab Shia and Sunnis migrating to Sulaimaniyah Province for 
economic reasons or fleeing sectarian violence, as well as Kurds 
displaced from Kirkuk due to circumstances surrounding the planned 
Article 140 referendum process.  The Sulaimaniyah Census Directorate 
recorded a total of 2890 IDP families arrived to Sulaimaniyah since 
October 2006 and 510 families since January 2007.  END SUMMARY.

BACKGROUND ON IDP COORDINATION MEETING 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) RRT Offs attended an IDP Coordination Meeting at the 
Sulaimaniyah Government Building on February 12.  The goal was to 
establish a monthly meeting to coordinate support to IDPs and to 
identify ongoing projects so as to not duplicate efforts. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The next three coordination meetings will be held on a 
bi-monthly basis and thereafter on a monthly basis. 
 
---------- 
ATTENDEES 
---------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  The attendees of the February 12 IDP Coordination Meeting 
included: RRT Officer Mergy, RRT PAO Crifo, U.S. Army Civil Affairs 
Team Leader for Sulaimaniyah Major Limehouse, the Deputy Governor of 
Sulaimaniyah Province, Jutyar Nuri Abd Allah, and Hewa Jaff, Foreign 
and Public Relations Office, Sulaimaniyah Province as well as 
representatives from the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR), Quandil Company (UNHCR implementing partner), 
International Medical Corps, Mine Advisory Group, Research Triangle 
Institute, Heartland Alliance, and the International Committee of 
the Red Cross and Red Crescent Society. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
INFORMATION REQUIRED FOR IDP ASSISTANCE 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The attendees enumerated points of information that help 
determine eligibility for assistance.  For effective information 
gathering and tracking, collection will occur when the IDPs register 
with provincial officials or approach the provincial government for 
assistance.  The information will then be entered into a database 
along with basic facts on IDPs now recorded by the Sulaimaniyah 
provincial government.  By enlarging the information base on the 
IDPs, organizations will have a more thorough view.  It was agreed 
that the following information needed to be gathered: 
 
-- Female headed household. 
-- Number of children under 18 and their ages. 
-- Number of elderly and ill family members. 
-- Number of pregnant women. 
-- Principal source of income in detention. 
-- Number of disabled family members. 
-- United Nations refugee or asylee status. 
-- Type of living accommodation. 
-- Number of families living in accommodation. 
-- Income level and source. 
-- Date of arrival. 
-- Last residence (place of origin). 
-- Status of Iraqi Kurdistan Region food rationing card. 
-- Access to education. 
-- Ethnic and religious background.

NUMBER OF IDPs ASSISTED 
-------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Sulaimaniyah local officials reported that since the 
beginning of 2007, the provincial government provided assistance to 
510 IDP families and since October 2006 to a total of 1890 families. 
 (Note: these figures may present a degree of artificial increase in 
IDP numbers. End note.)  The IDP population is mostly Iraqi Arab 
Sunni and Shia with some Kurds migrating from Kirkuk.  Various NGO 
organizations state IDP Christian families are estimated to have 
migrated to Dohuk. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Local officials emphasized they are no longer able to 
offer the same level of support given in the past.  In a courtesy 
call following the meeting, the Governor of Sulaimaniyah stressed to 
the attendees that he is deeply appreciative of the efforts to help 
the IDPs, but that he is concerned over the budgetary requirements 
to manage the increasing numbers of IDPs.

NEXT IDP COORDINATION MEETING MARCH 1 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) The attendees will meet again on March 1 in Sulaimaniyah. 
A draft version of the new IDP form that includes required 
information will be circulated beforehand via e-mail.  The next 
meeting will be a session where the location of IDPs in the 
Sulaimaniyah province will be identified on a map.

COMMENT 
-------- 
 
¶8.  (SBU) The initiative by the Sulaimaniyah provincial government 
to bring together NGOs, the RRT, and U.S. Army Civil Affairs to 
discuss IDPs reflects the diminished resources of the provincial 
government to deal with the increasing numbers of IDPs.  The 
provincial government is anxious to get international funding for 
IDPs. END COMMENT.
