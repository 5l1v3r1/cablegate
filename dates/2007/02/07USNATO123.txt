¶3.  The primary mode of transportation for visitors to 
Brussels is metered taxis, which are plentiful and reliable. 
Fares, which can be vouchered, are quite expensive.  The bus, 
tram and metro system are excellent. 
 
¶3.  A NATO visitor pass has been requested and will be 
available at NATO HQ's main entrance gate.   For security 
reasons, all visitors, even those with a green NATO badge, 
must present two pieces of identification 
or their blue State Department-issued badge to the Marine 
Guard before being admitted into the U.S. Mission. 
 
¶4.  Computer and Electronics Usage:  Inter-agency security 
standards prohibit the introduction or use of non-USG owned 
computer hardware and software at all USG diplomatic 
facilities.  Cell phones, palm pilots, radios and other 
convenience electronics are prohibited in all secure areas of 
the Mission.  Travelers who anticipate having special needs 
in terms of either access or computer usage should contact 
the RSO office before arriving at post. Visitors must leave 
cell phones and other electronic equipment with the Marine 
Guard.  Mission appreciates your cooperation. 
 
¶5.  There is a branch of the ING Bank at NATO which has an 
ATM that accepts U.S. bank/credit union cards on the "PLUS" 
system.  Numerous downtown banks also have ATM machines. 
Traveler's checks can be exchanged in most banks.  On Tuesday 
and Thursday mornings, there is a cashier at USNATO to which 
TDY visitors with travel orders have access. 
 
¶6.  Threat Assessment:  A worldwide caution regarding the 
threat of transnational terrorism was issued by the 
Department of State.  (Please consult the Department's 
website for text:  HTTP:Travel.State.Gov.)  In light of this 
caution and the events of September 11, 2001, all visitors 
are encouraged to assess their security posture, and be alert 
to their surroundings.  All visitors should exercise caution 
while traveling abroad as U.S. citizens and facilities are 
often the target of groups demonstrating opposition to the 
U.S. foreign policy. 
 
¶7.  Belgium remains a relatively safe country but as a result 
of the war in Iraq, and sentiments expressed by its citizens 
against the war, American visitors are advised to exercise 
caution and avoid anti-American demonstrations.  Also, it is 
prudent not to wear clothes or carry articles with logos and 
emblems associated with the United States at this time.  By 
taking reasonable precautions, visitors should enjoy an 
uneventful stay.  However, purse snatching and pick-pocketing 
are occurring more frequently.  In Brussels, pick-pocketing 
and purse snatching are more prevalent in the metro system 
(subway, bus, tram) and at Brussels' three major train 
stations:  Gare du Nord (North Station), Gare Centrale 
(Central Station), and especially Gare du Midi (South 
Station).  Victims have been asked for assistance by someone 
who appeared lost and anxious to catch their train.  As the 
victim responds to the request, a third person appears and 
steals laptop computers, and other related travel items. 
According to the police, this is a new strategy by criminal 
gangs operating at Centrale Station.  Apparently they prefer 
platforms 3 and 4, used by trains going to the airport and 
obviously carrying the best category of potential victims. 
Valuables should never be left unattended in vehicles and car 
doors should always be kept locked when driving.  Carry only 
a minimum amount of cash, credit cards and ID.  Expensive 
jewelry, financial records, address books and other personal 
effects should be left at home or stored in a safe place 
during your visit. 
 
 
¶8.  Emergency numbers for the Police and Medical Assistance 
are 101 and 100 respectively, and for cellular phones 
(locally) 112.  Visitors to Belgium requiring additional 
information should contact the Brussels Regional Security 
Office at 32-2-508-2370 (if dialing locally, 02-508-2370). 
 
¶9.  Please advise if further information is needed.
