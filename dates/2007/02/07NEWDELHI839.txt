¶3.  Description of persecution claim, as presented by PA via 
telcon and emails:  Dhia Noor Mowafak served as an 
interpreter with the U.S. army in Baghdad for three years. 
He claims that, starting in early 2006, a group of men 
wearing black clothes who carried machine guns visited his 
home approximately five or six times and threatened to kill 
him.  He could not identify the group.  The first time, the 
black-clad group came to his house and said something to the 
effect of, "We know you.  You are working for the U.S. Army. 
You are Palestinian.  We are going to kill you." 
Approximately one month later, they returned to his house and 
threatened him again.  Following the second visit, Dhia Noor 
Mowafak's youngest son (six years old) was kidnapped from 
school.  Mowafak spent about 40 days looking for his son 
before the kidnappers demanded a ransom of about 
75,000-80,000 USD.  Mr. Mowafak said that he used all of his 
savings and borrowed the rest of the money from 
friends/family.  He was instructed to meet the kidnappers at 
a particular place and hand over the money, which he did. 
His son was returned alive.  Again, he could not identify the 
kidnappers.  At this point, Dhia Noor Mowafak started looking 
for ways to escape from Iraq.  He said that he could not 
return to Palestine because he was born in Baghdad. 
Eventually, the harassment escalated and "they took my money, 
took my home, and my family was forced to leave with only the 
clothes on their backs."  He paid someone a fee to secure 
transportation out of Iraq - and arrived in India in December 
¶2006. 
 
¶4.  PolOff has spoken with Dhia Noor Mowafak and sent scanned 
copies of his documentation (including U.S. military 
identification badge indicating that he was a translator and 
letters of recommendation by U.S. military officials, etc) to 
the RefCoord in Baghdad.  In addition, CONS checked CLASS and 
he has no hits. 
 
¶5.  Mowafak explained to Poloff that he is desperate for

assistance.  He claims that he is suffering from a heart 
problem in which "my arteries are weak and my father died of 
the same condition."  His wife also has high blood pressure. 
In addition, the family has no access to financial means and 
Mowafak has asked for assistance in order to support his 
family.  PolOff has been in touch with UNHCR, which is 
currently experiencing considerable backlogs, and making 
appointments through September 2007. 
 
¶6.  Justification for Resettlement:  Mowafak is under threat 
because of his employment with the U.S. government. His 
service to the USG merits special handling and, because of 
health concerns and no access to financial support, he is 
particularly vulnerable.  UNHCR is experiencing considerable 
delays and will not be able to refer Mowafak for processing 
in a timely manner.  We welcome Embassy Baghdad's assessment 
as well.
