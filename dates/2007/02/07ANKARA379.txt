¶1. The Turkish Parliament ratified on January 24 the Bilateral 
Agreement on Cooperation to Facilitate the Provision of Assistance 
for Nonproliferation Purposes (EXBS), which was originally signed on 
June 14, 2005.  The agreement, which was ratified despite the 
objection of the CHP (Republican Peoples' Party) opposition party, 
foresees supporting Turkey's efforts to enhance its national export 
control system, law enforcement, and border security to prevent, 
deter, detect and interdict illicit trafficking of WMD, missile 
delivery systems and related dual-use commodities and technology.

Moldovan-registered aircraft traveling from Adana, Turkey to Balad,

while trying to land in foggy conditions outside of Balad.  The 
Turkish Foreign Ministry announced that there were 29 Turkish and 1 
U.S. passengers aboard, in addition to 4 foreign crew members. 
Turkish newspapers speculated that the plane might have been brought 
down.  The sole survivor of the incident, a Turkish national, was 
brought back to Turkey following medical treatment in Iraq. 
 
Turkey's Security Relations with Other Countries 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶4. Lebanon: On January 3 PM Tayyip Erdogan visited the Turkish Corps

Lebanon (UNIFIL), according to ANA. 
 
¶5. Greece: Turkish media reported that Turkish F-16 jets were 
intercepted five times by Greek military jets on January 8 while 
flying in international airspace over the Aegean Sea.  Responding to 
journalists' questions on the issue a few days after the 
'harassment' incident, Turkish Chief of General Staff (CHOD) Gen 
Yasar Buyukanit said that, despite this, the two militaries maintain 
good relations. (Turkish Daily News) 
 
¶6. Ukraine: CHOD Buyukanit met his Ukrainian counterpart Gen Serguy 
Kiricenko in Ankara on January 15.  No information on the subject of 
their meeting was made public.  Turkish and Ukrainian Naval Forces

¶8. Azerbaijan: Turkish media reported that the Azerbaijani 
government was planning to assign a Turkish general officer as its 
Deputy Defense Minister.  The Turkish general is expected to resume 
the post in mid-2007 and to hold the duty until 2011.  Several 
dailies wrote that the assignment was similar to the assignment of a 
retired American colonel as CHOD in Lithuania in 2002. (Note: The 
Turkish MFA claimed no knowledge of any such arrangement and 
suggested that perhaps a general officer will be assigned to advise 
the Azerbaijani defense ministry on a temporary basis. End 
note.)(moderate pro-Islamic Zaman and moderate pro-Islamic Cihan
