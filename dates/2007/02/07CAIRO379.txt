¶1.  (SBU) Embassy Cairo warmly welcomes the visit of 
Ambassador John Lange and the interagency avian influenza 
team.  We are looking forward exchanging ideas on local avian 
influenza challenges, potential areas of enhanced 
cooperation, and developing a more cohesive interagency 
strategy. 
 
-------------------------------- 
VIRUS STATUS: HUMANS AND POULTRY 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) As of February 2007, the GOE confirmed twenty human 
cases of H5N1 virus, resulting in twelve fatalities.  All six 
human victims since September 2006 have succumbed to the 
disease.  According to the WHO, in 2006 Egypt had the highest 
number of human cases outside Asia.  In January 2007, CDC 
confirmed NAMRU,s diagnosis that the virus responsible for 
the deaths of human cases 17 and 18 was Tamiflu resistant 
(ref A).  Case 19 did not show the same resistance to Tamiflu 
(ref B) nor did the most recent death of a 17-year-old from 
Fayyoum on February 4. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In broader terms, mutations in specimens from 
recent cases show Egypt could be acting as a type of &mixing 
bowl8 for diverse strains of H5N1 originating thousands of 
miles away.  This is likely due to the fact that Egypt is 
located on two major avian flight paths and millions of 
migratory birds fly over the country annually. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) On January 28, the Minister of Health and 
Population (MOHP) Hatem El Gebali announced the formation of 
a committee to study use of alternative drugs to Tamiflu. 
The Regional Medical Office at Embassy Cairo is also 
preparing receive as shipment of a second antiviral 
medication called Zanamivir (Relenza) as a backup medication. 
 We are scheduled to get enough to treat 23% of the official 
Embassy population.  We are also acquiring additional doses 
of the older antiviral medication amantadine. 
 
¶5. (SBU)  The initial AI outbreak in February, 2006 
devastated Egypt's poultry industry, and resulted in 
significant layoffs and estimated losses of at least $100 
million.  The GOE placed a widely enforced ban on live bird 
markets and backyard poultry raising in Cairo.  Commercial 
farmers began a stringent vaccination campaign, which 
continues today.   The commercial sector is almost 
universally AI free.  According to official MOHP figures, 
since February 2006, there have been 859 outbreak sites in 
the commercial poultry sector, but only one since July 2006. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The &backyard8 poultry sector is ground zero for 
both poultry and human AI infections in Egypt, largely due to 
the fact that in rural areas, people live with poultry and 
slaughter it in their homes.  MOHP figures show a recent 
upsurge in the number of backyard AI cases.  Of the 244 
backyard sites identified since February 2006, 50 were 
identified during the period of December 2006-January 2007. 
Consequently, 18 of the 20 human cases were backyard farmers. 
 Live poultry markets are up and running again both in Cairo 
and in rural areas.  Rooftop poultry raising is again common 
in Cairo. 
 
¶7. (SBU)  During the initial AI outbreaks, the highest levels 
of government recognized the need to greatly reform the 
poultry sector.  At a March 5, 2006 meeting with poultry 
producers, Prime Minister Nazif stressed the need to 
transform Egypt's poultry industry, calling for a move from 
small-scale farming and live-bird trade to large-scale modern 
production at collocated breeding and processing facilities 
which would be subject to governmental health and 
environmental oversight.  The government is in the planning 
stages of these reforms.
