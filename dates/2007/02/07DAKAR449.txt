RESERVATIONS WILL BE ADJUSTED AS APPROPRIATE AFTER RECEIPT OF 
PARTICIPANT TRAVEL ITINERARY.  THE HOTEL IS LOCATED IN THE POINTE

THE ROOM RATE FOR THE MERIDIEN PRESIDENT IS CFAF 65,500 OR 
APPROXIMATELY USD 133 PER DAY.  INFORMATION REGARDING DAKAR'S 
CURRENT PER DIEM RATES IS AVAILABLE AT: 
.  DUE TO FREQUENT FLUCTUATIONS 
IN THE USD: CFA EXCHANGE RATE, EMBASSY DAKAR RECOMMENDS THAT 
TRAVELERS REQUEST AN AMENDMENT TO THEIR TRAVEL ORDERS WHICH 
AUTHORIZES PAYMENT OF ACTUAL LODGING EXPENSES INCURRED. 
 
¶4.  AIRPORT ASSISTANCE: BASED UPON THE PARTICIPANT TRAVEL ITINERARY, 
OUR EMBASSY EXPEDITOR WILL MEET AND ASSIST FOR BOTH ARRIVAL AND 
DEPARTURE, AND WILL FURNISH TRANSPORTATION AS WELL. ALL CONFERENCE

¶6.  TRAVELING ON SAA VIA NEW YORK?: FOR THOSE FLYING SOUTH AFRICAN 
AIRWAYS (SAA) WITH A CONNECTION IN NEW YORK, WE HAVE NOTED FREQUENT 
DELAYS IN THE RECEIPT OF CHECKED LUGGAGE.  OF NINE RECENT ARRIVALS 
IN DAKAR, SEVEN ARRIVED WITHOUT THEIR LUGGAGE.  WHILE THE LUGGAGE 
TYPICALLY IS DELIVERED ONE OR TWO DAYS AFTER ARRIVAL, WE RECOMMEND 
THAT TRAVELERS LAYOVER IN NEW YORK FOR AT LEAST 3 HOURS PRIOR TO 
THEIR SAA FLIGHT DEPARTURE.  A LAYOVER OF THIS LENGTH APPEARS TO 
DECREASE LUGGAGE PROBLEMS. 
 
¶7.  MEDICAL SERVICES: DAKAR HAS LIMITED MEDICAL FACILITIES AND 
VISITORS MAY HAVE TO BE MEDICALLY EVACUATED IN THE EVENT OF A MAJOR 
ILLNESS OR INJURY. WE RECOMMEND MEDICAL EVACUATION INSURANCE FOR ALL 
VISITORS, UNLESS THEY ARE COVERED BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S MEDICAL 
PROGRAM. 
 
¶8.  HEALTH CONCERNS: SENEGALESE IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES OFTEN 
INSPECT THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION IMMUNIZATION CARD OF TRAVELERS 
ON ARRIVAL TO VERIFY IMMUNIZATIONS AGAINST YELLOW FEVER WITHIN THE 
PAST TEN YEARS AND AGAINST MENINGITIS WITHIN THE PAST THREE YEARS. 
IN ADDITION, WE RECOMMEND THAT TRAVELERS HAVE CURRENT IMMUNIZATION 
AGAINST TYPHOID.  MALARIA IS ENDEMIC IN WEST AFRICA AND TRAVELERS 
SHOULD BE TAKING APPROPRIATE ANTI-MALARIAL MEDICATION PRIOR TO 
ARRIVAL, DURING THEIR STAY, AND FOLLOWING THEIR RETURN TO A 
 
DAKAR 00000449  002 OF 002 
 
 
MALARIA-FREE ENVIRONMENT. 
 
¶9.  SECURITY: DAKAR IS RATED HIGH THREAT FOR CRIME AND TRANSNATIONAL 
TERRORISM.  COMMON SECURITY PRECAUTIONS THAT ONE WOULD TAKE IN ANY 
LARGE U.S. CITY ARE PRUDENT.  VISITORS TO DAKAR ARE ENCOURAGED TO 
READ THE LATEST SECURITY INFORMATION FOR TRAVELERS AT: 
. 
 
¶10.  TRAVEL DOCUMENTS: TRAVELERS MUST HAVE A VALID PASSPORT TO ENTER 
SENEGAL. AMERICAN CITIZENS DO NOT NEED A SENEGALESE VISA FOR VISITS 
OF LESS THAN 90 DAYS. BON VOYAGE!
