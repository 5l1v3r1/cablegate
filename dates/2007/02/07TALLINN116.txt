SUBJECT: ESTONIA UNCERTAIN ON SUPPORT FOR UN MIDDLE RING 
SECURITY IN IRAQ 
 
REF: STATE 17022 
 
On February 21 we delivered reftel points to Andres Kolk, MFA 
Counselor for Security and Arms Control, regarding Estonian 
contributions to the UN Middle Ring security in Iraq.  Kolk 
said that although Estonia contributed to the Distinct Entity 
Trust Fund in 2004 and 2005, it is unlikely that the 
Government of Estonia will make additional contributions to 
the Trust Fund due to budgetary constraints.
