SUBJECT: UK WILL NOT EXTEND TRAINERS AT JIPTC 
 
REF: (A) STATE 15955 (B) LONDON 526 
 
The UK has decided not to extend its trainers, nor recruit 
new ones, for the Jordan International Police Training Center 
beyond the February 27 expiration of the current team's 
contract.  Amy Clemitshaw, in the FCO's Iraq Policy Office 
told LabCouns the UK will instead focus its resources on the 
Joint Leadership Academy it hopes to open at Basra Air 
Station in June.  Clemitshaw said the JLA will focus on 
in-country training in leadership and command and control. 
She noted that their police team in Basra is working with MND 
(SE) to provide training both to officers of the Iraqi Army 
(through MND(SE)) and to the Iraqi Police Service (through 
the UK civilian police team).  Clemitshaw underlined that 
their police teams in both Baghdad and Basra understand the 
importance of working with CPATT to ensure that the training 
is fully in sync with the courses CPATT has developed and are 
running elsewhere in Iraq.
