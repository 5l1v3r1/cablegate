SUBJECT: COUNTRY CLEARANCE APPROVAL FOR REGIONAL 
STRATEGIC INITIATIVE (RSI) CONFERENCE 
 
REF: STATE 018585 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1.  Ambassador Janice L. Jacobs and Embassy Dakar 
warmly welcome and grant country clearance to all 
participants for attendance at the RSI Conference 
to be held in Dakar on 13 March 2007 to: 
 
¶2.  CONFERENCE POINTS OF CONTACT: 
a) Embassy control officer will be RSO John Bray. 
Embassy Tel: [221] 823-4296 X2311, Cell: [221] 
644-0610, Home: [221] 820-5048, E-mail: 
BrayFJ@state.gov 
b) For coordination of administrative support 
needs, please e-mail DakarRSIConfAdmin@state.gov 
and mignanogs@state.gov.  (NOTE: Participants are 
requested to forward travel itinerary to the 
DakarRSIConfAdmin@state.gov and 
mignanogs@state.gov as soon as possible.  END 
NOTE.) 
 
¶3.  ACCOMMODATIONS: We have reserved a block of 
rooms for all participants at the Meridien 
President Hotel.  Individual hotel reservations 
will be adjusted as appropriate after receipt of 
participant travel itinerary.  The hotel is 
located in the Pointe des Almadies area of Dakar. 
Hotel telephone number is [221] 869-6969.  Hotel 
fax number is Fax: [221] 869-6924.  Additional 
hotel information is available at: 
www.starwoodhotels.com/lemeridien/index.html 
 
The room rate for the Meridien President is CFAF 
65,500 or approximately USD 133 per day. 
Information regarding Dakar?s current per diem 
rates is available at: 
.  Due to 
frequent fluctuations in the USD: CFA exchange 
rate, Embassy Dakar recommends that travelers 
request an amendment to their travel orders which 
authorizes payment of actual lodging expenses 
incurred. 
 
¶4.  AIRPORT ASSISTANCE: Based upon the 
participant travel itinerary, our Embassy 
expeditor will meet and assist for both arrival 
and departure, and will furnish transportation as 
well. All conference participants will be met by 
an Embassy expeditor at planeside and processed 
through the airport?s VIP Lounge before 
proceeding to the Meridien hotel. 
 
¶5.  CONFERENCE SPECIFICS: The conference will be 
held at the USAID Building located approximately 
five minutes from the Meridien President Hotel. 
Support services available at the conference 
site, contact information and other details will 
be provided via e-mail upon receipt of 
participant travel information. 
 
¶6.  TRAVELING ON SAA VIA NEW YORK?: For those 
flying South African Airways (SAA) with a 
connection in New York, we have noted frequent 
delays in the receipt of checked luggage.  Of 
nine recent arrivals in Dakar, seven arrived 
without their luggage.  While the luggage 
typically is delivered one or two days after 
arrival, we recommend that travelers layover in 
New York for at least 3 hours prior to their SAA 
flight departure.  A layover of this length 
 
appears to decrease luggage problems. 
¶7.  MEDICAL SERVICES: Dakar has limited medical 
facilities and visitors may have to be medically 
evacuated in the event of a major illness or 
injury. We recommend medical evacuation insurance 
for all visitors, unless they are covered by the 
State Department's medical program. 
 
¶8.  HEALTH CONCERNS: Senegalese Immigration 
authorities often inspect the World Health 
Organization immunization card of travelers on 
arrival to verify immunizations against yellow 
fever within the past ten years and against 
meningitis within the past three years.  In 
addition, we recommend that travelers have 
current immunization against typhoid.  Malaria is 
endemic in West Africa and travelers should be 
taking appropriate anti-malarial medication prior 
to arrival, during their stay, and following 
their return to a malaria-free environment. 
 
¶9.  SECURITY: Dakar is rated high threat for 
crime and transnational terrorism.  Common 
security precautions that one would take in any 
large U.S. city are prudent.  Visitors to Dakar 
are encouraged to read the latest security 
information for travelers at: 
. 
 
¶10.  TRAVEL DOCUMENTS: Travelers must have a 
valid passport to enter Senegal. American 
citizens do not need a Senegalese visa for visits 
of less than 90 days. Bon voyage!
