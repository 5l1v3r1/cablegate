NEW PLAN FOR SUNNI ENGAGEMENT 
 
REF: BAGHDAD 507 
 
¶1. (U) This is a PRT Tikrit, Salah ad Din cable. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Salah ad Din Deputy Governor Abdullah Ajbarah has 
been engaged on reconciliation and is keen to see greater 
Sunni involvement in the political process.  In that vein, he 
passed the following letter to a number of individuals, 
including MNC-I Commanding General Odierno, PRT officials, 
and a Western media reporter.  He says that many resistance 
groups in the area have expressed their support for the ideas 
put forth in the following letter (NFI). 
 
¶3. (SBU) BEGIN TEXT: 
 
NOTES ABOUT THE NEW WAY FORWARD IN IRAQ 
 
Dear ladies and Gentlemen, 
 
I would like to tell you about our idea for reconciliation in 
Iraq and also about the new American plan in Iraq. 
 
¶1.  The plan should concentrate on using political means more 
than military action, but military action should be taken to 
complete and close the gaps in the capabilities of the Iraqi 
Army (IA) and Iraqi Police (IP).  We first need to ensure the 
IPs, especially in Baghdad, are stripped of any militias. 
 
¶2.  The constitution should be suspended now and at the same 
time, we should form a new Iraqi governorate, to include all 
Iraqi ethnic groups with technocratic ministers. 
 
¶3.  We should reinstate certain Ba'ath Party members, along 
with the former IA members, and security system members also. 
 We must allow for the Ba'ath Party to work again, alongside 
the other political parties. 
 
¶4.  We need to change the election rules from electing a 
party to electing a candidate, depending on the percentage of 
persons from each area who vote for that candidate. 
 
¶5.  The new constitution should be rewritten to improve it 
and have all ethnic groups approve it. 
 
¶6.  We should start to collect weapons and ordnance from the 
streets, using a cash-for-weapons program at first, by the 
law. 
 
¶7.  After collecting their weapons, the militias must be 
dissolved immediately. 
 
¶8.  We have to improve the capabilities of the IA and IP.  We 
have to provide them with more and better equipment, like 
helicopters, intelligence gathering systems, and better 
communications systems. 
 
¶9.  We need to organize present and former Iraqi leaders to 
discuss and develop our own plan for the future of Iraq, as 
it concerns the coalition military presence.  If we develop 
our own plan with timeline for withdrawal, the Iraqi people 
will be more approving and accepting of the current situation. 
 
¶10.  We have to minimize the influences of the Iranians and 
Syrians in our country, and find a way to stop their support 
for the terrorists in Iraq. 
 
¶11.  We need to start major economic development projects in 
Iraq, especially in the areas of electricity and fuel, so 
Iraqis can see the progress and feel we are making 
significant improvements. 
 
¶12.  We need to ensure the Coalition Forces (CF) never side 
with one ethnic group over the other, especially on the issue 
of dividing power or territory in Iraq.  The CF must remain 
impartial at all times and on all levels. 
 
¶13.  We need to ensure the Central Criminal Court of Iraq in 
Baghdad consists of a representative mix of all ethnic groups 
to ensure fair trials. 
 
These ideas above are the feelings of some of the resistance 
groups in Iraq and also the Sunni Triangle, with whom I 
maintain communications, due to my former status.  I hope 
that you pass this to the leaders in the US to get the 
success in Iraq. 
 
With my best regards,
