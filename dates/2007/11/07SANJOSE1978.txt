REF: STATE 137178 
 
¶1.  Econoff met with officials of the Costa Rican Ministry of 
Foreign Trade (COMEX) on October 12 to discuss the USG position 
cited in Reftel on the Inter-American Proposal presented in the 
Inter-American Telecommunication Commission of the OAS.  COMEX 
officials stated that the GOCR could not present its position as it 
required coordination among two other institutions, the Ministry of 
Science and Technology and the Instituto Costarricense de 
Electricidad (ICE). 
 
¶2.  COMEX officials noted the USG position on radio regulations and 
said they would take it into consideration. After COMEX later 
provided to Post a contact person at ICE, Post followed up with ICE 
but did not receive a response.  We therefore do not anticipate a 
GOCR response in time for the November 16 vote.
