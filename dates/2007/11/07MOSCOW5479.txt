¶1. (U) This is an action request.  See paragraph 4. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The November 11 oil spill in the Kerch Strait (which runs 
between the Black and Azov Seas near Crimea) continues to affect 
large numbers of fish and wildlife and is now spreading into the Sea 
of Azov (refs A, B).  Efforts to contain and remediate the spill 
have been limited by high seas and reported GOR disagreements with 
Ukraine over construction of a temporary dam between mainland Russia 
and the Ukrainian Island of Tuzla (ref B).  Damages from the 
disaster continue to mount and U.S. emergency assistance is required 
to advise on a containment and remediation plan. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Given the potential of emergency assistance to avert 
long-term economic and environmental damage to Sea of Azov and Black 
Sea, the Ambassador declares the oil spill in the Kerch Strait a 
disaster.  He has determined that the incident is of a sufficient 
magnitude to warrant external assistance (ref A), the GOR has stated 
its willingness to accept assistance (ref B), and it is in the 
interests of the United States to provide such assistance. 
 
¶4. (SBU) ACTION: Mission requests OFDA consideration and approval of 
up to USD 50,000 to provide short-term technical expertise to 
mitigate environmental and economic damages.  In consultation with 
OFDA, Embassy proposes that these funds be used to support rapid 
assessment of the situation by a team from the U.S. Coast Guard or 
other agencies to consult with the GOR on the most appropriate 
response.  Remaining funds are also proposed to support short-term 
remediation efforts of local non-governmental organizations.
