¶1.  (SBU) All media headlined the November 4 release of the 
eight Turkish soldiers held hostage since October 21 by the 
terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).  Before boarding 
his plane to Washington for his November 5 meeting with 
President Bush, PM Erdogan thanked the U.S. and Iraqi 
governments for their work in freeing the hostages.  When 
asked by the press how the return of the troops would affect 
his visit, he commented, "I am in a positive mood...(we hope 
that) we will return from this meeting with positive results." 
 
¶2.  (SBU) While all are happy to see the soldiers safely home 
and the press highlighted the constructive role played by the 
USG and GOI in freeing the troops, many columnists speculated 
on the timing and motives surrounding the release.  Most 
media characterized the event as a "gesture" - one designed 
to convince Turkey not to conduct a cross border operation 
(CBO) -- conspicuously executed just prior to the November 5 
meeting.  While pro-government daily Yeni Safak opined the 
U.S. wanted to "erase the image of the (July 4, 2003 
detention of Turkish special forces by U.S. troops) sack 
incident," mainstream Milliyet viewed it as an "indication of 
the U.S. determination" to resolve the problem.  Deputy PM 
and GOT Spokesman Cemil Cicek warned that the fight against 
terrorism should not be regarded as if it depended on a 
single measure, adding "There should not be the impression 
that only a CBO would resolve the problem."  Nevertheless, 
the press has expressed renewed optimism for increased 
U.S.-Turkish cooperation following Erdogan's visit. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The peripheral role played by three pro-Kurdish 
Democratic Society Party (DTP) deputies in securing the 
release of the hostages is drawing extensive public 
criticism.  In a statement to the press, DTP chair Ahmet Turk 
claimed the MPs traveled to Erbil as a humanitarian, not a 
political, endeavor.  Turk added "We believe that we had a 
responsibility... and tried to establish the necessary 
links."  Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) President 
Barzani's spokesman noted that the DTP MPs only played a 
"limited role."  Cemil Cicek dismissed DTP's participation as 
"solely propaganda," adding that pictures from the Erbil 
meeting were proof of DTP's friendly relations with the PKK. 
Nationalist Action Party (MHP) Vice Chair Tunca Toskay echoed 
Cicek's accusation when he said "The DTP was caught red 
handed."  Meanwhile, the Ankara Chief Prosecutor has started 
a study (the phase before an investigation) on the three DTP 
MPs regarding the Erbil trip. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Media reports also covered the GOI,s closure of 
several PKK-affiliated Democratic Solutions Party offices in 
Northern Iraq following the release of the Turkish troops. 
As part of his brief pre-departure comments to the press, 
Erdogan characterized the closures as "a positive 
development."  Columnists viewed the action against the PKK 
party bureaus with greater cynicism.  Hurriyet dismissed the 
efforts as "cosmetic measures taken to defuse tensions," and 
questioned how long the offices would remain shut.
