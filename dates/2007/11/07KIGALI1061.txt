¶1. (SBU)   Pol/Econ Chief and poloff met November 15 with 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs International Affairs Director 
Ben Rutsinga to discuss the U.S.-sponsored rape resolution 
pending before the General Assembly, and the FAO "external 
evaluation" demarche.  Rutsinga began by categorically 
restating what he told Embassy officers on three previous 
occasions (refs C, D and E): Rwanda supports USG language on 
the rape resolution.  He added that he had personally drafted 
and sent his Ministry's instructions to Rwanda's delegation 
in New York, mandating support for the USG resolution.  When 
asked once again if Rwanda would consider becoming a 
co-sponsor, he gave the same reply as previously: "We will 
consider it."  However, his remarks focused on Rwanda's 
unwavering support for the USG language on the resolution. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) In regard to the FAO "external evaluation" 
demarche, Rutsinga listened attentively to the general 
concept of a reform of the FAO through formal endorsement of 
the outside evaluation, and adoption of a one-year budget to 
aid the transition to a renewed and restructured FAO.  He 
noted that his ministry would work carefully with the 
Ministry of Agriculture on the issue, and he pledged that he 
would seek out the "technical officer" at Agriculture to gain 
his input by November 16.  He indicated that the Minister of 
Agriculture had sought permission to travel to Rome for the 
November 17-24 conference, and would likely receive it.  He 
offered to share the combined position of the two ministries 
when he had it in hand.
