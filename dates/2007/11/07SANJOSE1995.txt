Classified By: CDA Peter M Brennan for reason 1.4(d) 
 
¶1. (U) On November 16, we discussed Ref A concerns with 
Alejandro Solano Ortiz, Sub-director of the Foreign Policy 
Directorate of the MFA. 
 
¶2. (C) Although sympathetic to these concerns, Solano 
indicated that the GOCR worried about the implications of the 
constitutional reform now under way in Venezuela and 
understood the growing dissent in that country.  Solano added 
that the GOCR would cautiously voice its concern on those 
issues as appropriate opportunities arose. 
 
¶3. (C) Per Ref B, Post will engage with our contacts with 
senior-level government officials, assemblymen, local NGOs, 
and other groups.
