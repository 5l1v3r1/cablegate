Embassy Harare wishes to thank Embassy Lusaka for exemplary 
support in identifying and working tenaciously to secure 
former Reserve Bank of Zambia Governor Dr. Jacob Mwanza and 
World Bank Country Manager in Zambia Dr. Kapil Kapoor as 
speakers at the recent BFIF-funded "Just Business" forum 
(reftel).  In Zimbabwe's rapidly deteriorating business 
environment, dozens of prominent international economists and 
businessmen had declined the invitation of the American 
Business Association of Zimbabwe (ABAZ) to travel to Harare 
to identify and deliberate in a public forum over solutions 
to Zimbabwe's economic problems.  Embassy Lusaka was 
instrumental in securing an esteemed expert from the SADC 
region to relay to Zimbabweans how major economic policy 
shifts can turn around an economy; Dr. Mwanza's speech was 
widely regarded as the most effective presentation of the 
forum.  Without Embassy Lusaka's assistance, this public 
expression of transformational diplomacy could not have taken 
place.
