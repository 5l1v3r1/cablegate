¶1. "Israeli View Of The Summit" 
 
An op-ed by Israeli Ambassador in Brazil Tzipora Rimon in liberal, 
largest national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo (11/27) reads: 
"For Israel, the Annapolis conference is an opportunity to reach a 
common understanding in order to allow the negotiations to 
advance.... The event represents a starting point for the launching 
of peace negotiations and will include dozens of nations, including 
Brazil and Middle East states, which will provide a network of 
international protection to the process." 
 
¶2. "Constitution In the Barracks" 
 
Liberal, largest national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo 
(11/27) editorialized: "Bolivian President Evo Morales succeeded in 
approving the text of a new Constitution tailored according to his 
own interests. But the high political cost of the triumph may 
transform it into a Pyrrhic victory. Recent developments in Sucre 
have shown the level of polarization. The Constitution proposal was 
hastily voted in a military facility without the presence of the 
opposition congressmen.... The opposition now speaks about 
secession, while Morales suggests that he does not plan to 
retreat.... Helping to calm down the situation in Bolivia is an 
attitude that the Brazilian foreign policy should adopt." 
 
¶3. "More Instability in Bolivia" 
 
Business-oriented Valor Economico (11/27) maintained: "The hope of 
re-founding Bolivia beginning with a Constituent Assembly supported 
by President Evo Morales is fading away and involves dangerous 
indications that it may lead to a geographic, political and economic 
schism of the nation.... The government's attempt to change the 
rules and approve the Constitution at any cost will push Bolivia 
near a conflict of major proportions.... There are separatist armed 
movements and also radical leftist groups urging the closing of the 
Senate, seen as enemy of the people." 
 
¶4. "Evo and Hugo Misfortunes" 
 
Center-right national circulation daily O Estado de S. Paulo (11/27) 
editorialized: "Bolivian President Evo Morales and his mentor and 
master Hugo Chvez are beginning to harvest tempests even before 
finishing sowing winds.... The new Constitution text transfers to La 
Paz Chvez's model of perpetual reelection.... The problem in 
Bolivia is the opposition's strength.... Opposition to Bolivarianism 
is concentrated in the nation's most prosperous regions.... On the 
other hand, the inspirer of the autocratic wave that has swept 
Bolivia's incipient democratic institutions and seriously threatens 
those in Ecuador, Colonel Hugo Chvez, has no opposition in the 
Venezuelan Congress, which approved a constitution that restricts 
freedom. His problem now is to convince the population to approve a 
constitutional dictatorship in a referendum. To do so, he has 
exerted continuing pressure on the media."
