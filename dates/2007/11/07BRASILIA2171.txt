¶1.  (SBU)  Summary:  In response to reftel request, and pursuant to 
request for extension to Oct. 19 response date, Post submits the 
following information regarding the development and adoption of 
bio-based chemical products and liquid biofuels in Brazil, including 
research and reports available, funding, investment incentives and 
tax policies, etc.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (U) 
 
---------------- 
RESEARCH/REPORTS 
---------------- 
 
With regard to reftel paragraph 6, which requested titles, authors, 
and dates of publication of significant existing academic research, 
industry reports, government publications and/or other information 
on foreign government policies relating to the development and 
adoption of bio-based chemical products and liquid biofuels 
published since 2004: 
 
     a.  The USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) publishes 
annual reports regarding production of ethanol and biodiesel in 
Brazil each year.  2007 reports, available from FAS's Office of 
Agricultural Affairs and its Agricultural Trade Office (ATO), 
located in U.S. Embassy Brasilia and U.S. Consulate Sao Paulo, 
respectively, are: 
 
- BR7011 Brazil Biofuels Annual-Ethanol 
- BR7012 Brazil Biofuels Annual-Biodiesel 
- BR7015 Brazil Sugar Semi-Annual, which was released on Oct. 18 and 
contains ethanol statistics, as well. 
 
Contact the ATO as per information in paragraph 10 for copies via 
e-mail of these and previous reports. 
 
     b. www.biodiesel.gov.br is a GoB site with in-depth information 
on their biodiesel program, including legislation, research and 
production.  This site is available only in Portuguese. 
 
     c. http://www.portalunica.com.br/ portalunica/?Secao=referencia 
provides information on legislation and government programs 
supporting ethanol production and use.  While UNICA has an English 
language site, this section is only available in Portuguese. [Note: 
any spaces in any link referenced in this document must be deleted 
before attempting to utilize the link.  Cable format prohibits 
sending strings in excess of 55 characters without a space or return 
embedded.  End note.]

R&D Funding 
----------- 
 
¶3.  (U) Levels and trends of foreign government funding for R&D: 
 
-  Information on this topic obtained from the Instituto Agronomo, 
IAC, and EMBRAPA, the Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria, 
can be obtained in collaboration with the ATO. 
 
-  In addition, the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Scientifico 
e Tecnico (CNPq)/National Council for Scientific and Technical 
Development, an agency of the Brazilian Ministry of Science and 
Technology charged with scientific and technical research and the 
development of human resources, has recently announced $22 million 
Brazilian reais (approximately US$12.25 million) investment over the 
next few years for research in biodiesel and ethanol, through three 
sectoral funds:  Petroleum and Natural Gas (CT-Petro), Agrobusiness 
(CT-Agro) and Biotechnology (CT-Biotecnologia).  This R&D investment 
will be primarily designated for the center-west, north and 
northeast regions of Brazil, which have historically been 
underinvested for biofuels R&D.

active, particularly in the past two years, in signing Memoranda of 
Understanding (MOUs) or other agreements on biofuels with a number 
of countries, including the United States.  In addition, there has 
been significant private sector interest both from within and 
outside of Brazil in partnering with the GOB and Brazilian private 
industry.  Following are the countries with which the MRE has 
published its signed agreements with regard to biofuels or renewable
