SUBJECT: FUR ELDER BRIEFS CDA AFTER MEETINGS WITH REBEL LEADERS 
 
¶1. (SBU) Recently returned to Northern Sudan from visits to Paris, 
Juba, Kampala, and Nairobi to meet with Darfur rebel leaders, the 
legitimate Maqdoum (literally, "viceroy," one of the traditional 
Darfur tribal titles) of the Fur, Ahmed Abdelrahman Rijal, told CDA 
Fernandez on November 12 that he is working with the UN and AU to 
form an advisory body of IDPs to participate in the second phase of 
the Darfur peace process.  Disheartened that Sudan Liberation 
Movement (SLM) faction leader Abdulwahid al Nur refused to meet with 
him in France, Rijal hopes that the advisory body will be a vehicle 
for the IDPs to "represent themselves" rather than through 
Abdulwahid, who Rijal characterized as "not sound of mind." 
 
¶2. (SBU) Unification meetings in Juba among five rebel 
factions--including SLM/Ahmed Abdul Shafie, SLM/Khamis Abdullah, and 
two factions of the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM)--are 
proceeding, according to Rijal.  He intimated that he supported 
Abdul Shafie as a more viable Fur leader than Abdulwahid.  Rijal had 
briefed UN and AU officials in Khartoum on the findings of his trip 
and had presented his proposal for the formation of the IDP advisory 
body to Senior UN Political Advisor Moin Shrim. 
 
¶3. (SBU) CDA Fernandez was supportive of IDPs "organizing their 
voice" and underscored the importance of participating in 
negotiations in order to achieve their political aims.  He said that 
recent meetings between U.S. officials and National Congress Party 
(NCP) leaders had demonstrated that the Sudanese Government is 
suspicious of a role for the IDPs in the political process and the 
UN/AU's role in organizing the process.  Rijal acknowledged that he 
and several other tribal and civil society representatives were 
unable to attend the UN/AU-sponsored meeting in Sirte that began 
October 27 due to the Sudanese Government's interference. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Rijal also attributed ongoing tribal conflicts in South 
Darfur--such as those between the Turjum and the Northern 
Rizeigat--to NCP manipulation.  "They (the tribes) can't even buy 
jalabas, so where else are they getting land cruisers and heavy 
machine guns (Dshkas)?" he questioned.  The Government's unilateral 
declaration of a cessation of hostilities at the Sirte meeting still 
allows them to deny responsibility for the actions of the Arab 
tribes, said Rijal, and the NCP "will play this card indefinitely." 
CDA Fernandez suggested that the international community make a 
clear public declaration that it will not tolerate the NCP using 
Arab violence as an excuse for continued hostilities and will regard 
attacks by Arab tribes allied to the government as equivalent to 
attacks by their patrons in the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF). 
 
¶5. (SBU) Note: S/E Natsios issued a statement in Sirte on November 1 
that "the Government must also be held accountable for the actions 
of Darfur's Arab tribes or the Arab tribes must be brought directly 
into the process and held to the same commitments as the other 
parties."  Embassy will continue to deliver this message both 
publicly and to the GOS directly.  End note.
