SUBJECT: AUSTRALIA WANTS UNSC MANDATE FOR MNF-I FOR SEVERAL 
YEARS TO COME 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Zalmay M. Khalilzad, per 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
Â¶1. (C) During a meeting with Amb Khalilzad on November 2, 
Australian PermRep Robert Hill said his government would want 
a Chapter VII UNSC mandate for its troops in Iraq for several 
years to come (other issues reported septel).  Hill was 
reassured by Amb Khalilzad that the UNSC would extend the 
Chapter VII authorities for MNF-I at the end of 2007 for one 
year.  But Hill emphasized that when this mandate expires in 
2008, it should be extended again, rather than acceding to 
the Iraqi Government's preference that individual troop 
contributors conclude bilateral Status of Forces Agreements 
(SOFAs) to govern the conduct of their troops.  Hill was 
particularly concerned about possible Iraqi attempts to 
include a provision in the 2008 MNF-I resolution stipulating 
that this would be the last Chapter VII Council mandate.  Amb 
Khalilzad told him we understood Australia's concerns and 
would take them into account when discussing the issue with 
Iraq and other UNSC partners.
