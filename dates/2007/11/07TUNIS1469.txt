WEF Ranks Tunisia First in Africa 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (U) According to the World Economic Forum's 2007 Global 
Competitiveness Index, Tunisia ranks 32nd overall and first  among 
the countries of Africa and third in the Middle East.  This 
represents a slight drop over Tunisia's 2006 ranking as the 30th 
most competitive economy in the world (Ref D).  In the Middle East, 
Tunisia ranks below Kuwait (30) and Qatar (31), but is ranked much 
more highly than Morocco (64) and Algeria (81). 
 
¶8. (SBU) Comment: While the ranking has been touted by the GOT and 
in the local press, many foreign and Tunisian businessmen argue that 
this ranking is not an accurate reflection of Tunisia's 
competitiveness.  The rates for foreign and domestic investment (Ref 
A) indicate that many investors do not share the WEF's assessment. 
End Comment.
