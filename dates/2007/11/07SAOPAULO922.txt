"El Baradei's Report Is Ambiguous And Crucial" 
 
Center-right national circulation daily O Estado de S. Paulo's Paris 
correspondent Giles Lapouge commented (11/17): "IAEA Director 
Mohamed El Baradei's report on Iran's nuclear program is ambiguous. 
He admits to be unable to state whether Iran's nuclear program has a 
civilian or a military purpose. What is certain, however, is that El 
Baradei is pessimistic. And this is something new. He was accused in 
Washington of being too complacent in regards to Iranian whims. This 
is changing.... He has shown less leniency vis-`-vis Tehran's 
leaders.... The US has announced since Thursday that it will draft 
with its partners a third UN 'wave of sanctions.' The UK and 
especially France accompany Washington's mood.... The Paris-Tehran 
relationship is at its lowest level since Sarkozy's election. For 
Ahmadinejad, Sarkozy's most serious sin is to have explicitly 
aligned with the US on topics such financial sanctions against Iran. 
For Tehran, the worst is that France seems to have aligned also with 
Washington's bellicose positions."
