¶1. (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- Please

¶2. (SBU) SUMMARY:  The U.S. Department of Justice 
International Criminal Investigation Training Assistance 
Program (ICITAP) Indonesia collaborated recently with the 
French Embassy on a regional seminar entitled "Fighting 
Against Sexual Exploitation."  The seminar--which was held in 
Bali--was a continuation of the ICITAP Indonesian-Malaysian 
Bilateral TIP Program meant to develop regional responses 
against trafficking.  The seminar focused on identifying 
effective operational strategies to fight trafficking, 
underlining the importance of building region-wide 
coordination.  END SUMMARY. 
 
REGION-WIDE COORDINATION 
 
¶3. (SBU) From November 6-8, ICITAP Indonesia and the French 
Embassy sponsored a regional Trafficking in Persons seminar 
with the Indonesian National Police (INP).  Participants also 
hailed from: 
 
-- the Royal Malaysian Police (RMP); 
-- the Indonesian Attorney General Office (AGO); 
-- the Malaysian Attorney General Office (AGO); 
-- NGOs; 
-- the Australian Federal Police (AFP); 
-- the Royal Thai Police (RTP); 
-- the Timor 'Leste Police (TLP); 
-- International Organization on Migration (IOM); and, 
-- UNICEF. 
 
Nearly 80 officials participated in total. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The focus of the seminar involved identifying 
effective strategies that can be integrated throughout the 
region to develop cohesive responses and networks at the 
operational level to combat trafficking.  The ICITAP/INP 
"Point of Origin" police and NGO integration strategy was 
identified as an effective approach already in use in 
Indonesia.  Victim recovery and repatriation mechanisms, 
cultural considerations, impediments, and other mediating 
variables were a central theme throughout the discussions. 
 
¶5. (SBU) IOM, UNICEF, and NGO perspectives and insights on 
victim recovery and court preparation practices were well 
received.  The AFP perspective on standardized reporting 
mechanisms and TIP database development was particularly 
useful. 
 
TEAMWORK IS KEY 
 
¶6. (SBU) During the seminar, Indonesian and Malaysian 
authorities agreed to develop cross-functional teams of law 
enforcement, AGO officials, and NGOs.  The teams--after 
further consultation--would deploy to border crossing points 
along the Indonesian-Malaysian border with high volume 
trafficking.  ICITAP Indonesia would facilitate the 
development and training of the teams once they have been 
identified by host governments. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) The AFP and ICITAP Indonesia will also work with 
the INP to develop a standardized TIP reporting format for 
information received from victims, NGOs and law enforcement 
agencies from both Indonesia and Malaysia.  The reports will 
be collated into the INP Transnational Crime Center (TNCC) 
database at police headquarters in Jakarta.  The INP agreed 
to share this information and actionable intelligence with 
the RMP on a regular basis once the teams have been formed. 
The Royal Thai Police delegation asked to be kept informed as 
to the progress of the teams and indicated their desire to 
participate regionally. 
 
NEXT STEPS 
 
¶8. (SBU) This is the third session of the ICITAP INP/RMP TIP 
 
JAKARTA 00003146  002 OF 002 
 
 
Bilateral Project since April 2007, and the second session 
that involved French Embassy collaboration.  Despite the 
usual reticence and impediments of new operational 
initiatives, measurable progress was made.  Success can be 
attributed to identifying key participants that have the 
influence to carry out conference objectives, integrate 
participants into functional working groups, and focus on 
realistic operational objectives.  ICITAP Indonesia and the 
French Law Enforcement Liaison Officer will be conducting 
follow-up meetings in coordination with Embassy Kuala Lumpur 
and Indonesian stakeholders.
