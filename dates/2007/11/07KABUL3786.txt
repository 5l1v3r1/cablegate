SECURITY AND DEVELOPMENT 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  The Ambassador visited Uruzgan Province on October 
22 and met with the Governor and Provincial Council. 
Newly-installed Governor Hamdam said he already recognized 
the importance of development projects as a means to gain the 
loyalty and support of the local population.  He complained 
that corruption was "hijacking" projects and outlined his 
efforts to encourage the reconciliation of low-level Taliban. 
 The Provincial Council expressed support for President 
Karzai, expressed concern about security, asked for more 
development, and called for better coordination between 
security forces and the local community.  The Ambassador 
lauded the Governor's outreach to villages, underlined U.S. 
support for the reconciliation process, and promised the U.S. 
would be guided by local priorities as it dispensed a major 
increase of assistance to the province.  End Summary. 
 
GOVERNOR: DEVELOPMENT IS THE KEY TO LOYALTY 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  The Ambassador's visit to Uruzgan Province began 
with a call on newly-installed Governor Asadullah Hamdam. 
The Governor said that his first month in office had 
convinced him that international support in providing 
services and facilities (he mentioned madrasses and clinics) 
was the key to earning the support and loyalty of the 
population.  The Governor highlighted the lack of electricity 
in Uruzgan as a major issue.  Hamdam told the Ambassador of 
his concern that corruption was "hijacking" the government's 
capacity to provide roads, sanitation, clean water, schools 
and clinics.  District administration is also too often 
failing to take into account local tribal dynamics.  Hamdam 
said he was seeking tribal and mullah input and assistance in 
implementing programs.  He said he planned to cooperate 
closely with the PRT and new Police Chief as he put programs 
in place.  With outside help and local cooperation, he was 
confident he would succeed. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The Ambassador told Hamdam he had heard much the 
same message from Uruzgan MPs he had met with in Kabul two 
days before his visit.  Their development priorities were 
roads and electricity.  The Ambassador told the Governor 
there would be a dramatic increase in U.S. aid to Uruzgan 
during the coming year, and he assured Hamdam that the U.S. 
was commited to giving the province a voice in development 
planning. 
 
THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN TO ADDRESS SECURITY CONCERNS 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The Governor underlined the security challenge 
faced in Uruzgan.  ANA, ANP and international forces were 
scarce, but new ANA troops were arriving in the province the 
day of the meeting.  It was essential that ordinary people be 
willing to fight to defend their province as well.  Many had, 
but not all.  The Governor predicted fighting will slow in 
early winter, and he wanted to use the time to implement a 
plan to confront the challenge of the Taliban.  Senior 
Taliban were "totally brainwashed," and some local commanders 
had direct ties to Quetta, but he was confident that those in 
the lower ranks, starting with recently recruited teenagers, 
could be reconciled.  Hamdam stressed that the public in 
Taliban-controlled areas were unhappy but felt as if the 
Taliban would not allow them to leave.  The Taliban were 
enforcing strict rules: closing schools, a ban on TV, 
limitations on women, and forcing every home to give a young 
person to serve in the Taliban.  He outlined his major 
project for the coming weeks: to convene a provincial tribal 
jirga to urge an end to support for the Taliban and find ways 
to encourage reconciliation. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  The Ambassador said he recognized that fighting in 
Helmand and Kandahar was pushing Taliban presence, crime, and 
poppy cultivation north into Uruzgan.  He lauded Hamdam's 
willingness to take on the challenges and welcomed the 
 
KABUL 00003786  002 OF 002 
 
 
Governor's initiative in meeting with tribal shuras to find 
ways to encourage reconciliation.  The Ambassador underlined 
that the U.S. supports the PTS program and is committed to 
strengthening it.  The Taliban has lost key commanders over 
the past year, and if rank and file fighters want to return 
to normal life, the U.S. is committed to ensuring there is a 
way that can happen. 
 
MEETING WITH THE PROVINCIAL COUNCIL 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU)  In a follow-on meeting with the Provincial Council, 
the Ambassador heard that, while 95 percent of the people 
backed President Karzai, there are deep concerns over 
security.  The Ambassador responded that, despite talk of a 
Taliban "shadow government" in Uruzgan, there was only one 
government.  That is the Governor and Provincial Council. 
The Council voiced support for the Governor's plans to hold a 
Jirga for peace in the province.  They said people wanted 
security and peace.  They underlined the need for 
development, mentioning specifically the project to bring 
electricity from Kajaki Dam.  The Ambassador explained 
problems of expanding transmission lines from Kajaki, and 
emphasized the U.S. goal to connect the country by 
electricity.  The Taliban should be held accountable for 
attacks which slowed the project. 
 
¶7. (SBU)  When a Council member said international forces had 
made many mistakes in bombing and should coordinate closely 
with government authorities, the Ambassador assured the 
Council the U.S. is coordinating with the ANA and the 
government on military actions.  He reiterated that the 
Taliban should be held accountable for forcing innocents into 
the midst of battle.
