On November 20, a report appeared on the Somali website 
www.markacadeey.com, claiming that Eritrean officials had 
arrested exiled Member of Parliament, and U.S. Citizen, 
Hussein Mohammad Farah Aideed.  The report alleged that the 
Eritreans had arrested Aideed because he was spying for the 
United States and for Ethiopia.  Skeptical of the report 
because Aideed was known to have departed Eritrea prior to 
Eid al Fitr, Poloff asked Jama Ali Jama and Mohammad Sheikh, 
two exiled Somali Members of Parliament present in Asmara, 
whether they could confirm Aideed's whereabouts.  Both 
dismissed the claim and assured Poloff that Aideed has been 
residing in Dubai since leaving Eritrea the first week of 
October.
