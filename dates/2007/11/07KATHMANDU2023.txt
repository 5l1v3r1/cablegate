SUBJECT: NEPAL NONCOMMITTAL ON OPPOSING UNGA RESOLUTIONS 
WITH ANTI-ISRAEL BIAS 
 
REF: STATE 159386 
 
On November 28 Emboff urged Mani Bhattarai, Section Officer 
for UN and International Organizations at the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs (MFA), to advise the Government of Nepal's 
delegation to the UN in New York to vote against or abstain 
from voting for three UN General Assembly resolutions with 
anti-Israel bias.  Bhattarai asked whether a formal 
diplomatic note would be forthcoming from the United States 
on this issue.  He then said that the MFA would consider the 
request but could not say whether Nepal would oppose the 
resolutions.
