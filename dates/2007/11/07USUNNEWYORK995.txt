SUBJECT: UN HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES DISCUSSES IRAQ, 
PROBLEMS WITH PM MALIKI 
 
¶1. (SBU)  Summary: On November 7, Antonio Guterres, UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), discussed the subject of 
Iraq's internally displaced persons and refugees with 
Ambassador Khalilzad.  Later in the day, Guterres met with 
members of the UN,s Humanitarian Liaison Working Group 
(HLWG), which includes approximately 30 states, primarily 
western donors.  In both meetings, Guterres pointedly 
criticized Iraqi PM Maliki for failure to address the plight 
of Iraqi refugees in Syria and Lebanon.  During the HLWG 
meeting, Guterres noted that President Talabani and FM Zebari 
have been helpful, but said that PM Maliki has refused to 
provide Iraqi government assistance because the refugees are 
Sunni.  Guterres told these envoys that PM Maliki,s refusal 
to "accept Iraqi government responsibilities" with regard to 
its refugees is "very serious" and "dramatic," and blamed 
Maliki's "strong sectarian agenda."  End summary. 
 
REFUGEES 
 
¶2. (SBU) Guterres said UNHCR is active in Syria and Jordan, 
and described the Iraqi refugees in both countries as the 
largest urban refugee population in UNHCR,s history (more 
than two million).  He added that UNHCR has overcome its 
"semantic" issue with Syria and Jordan.  UNHCR will continue 
calling the Iraqis "refugees," while Syria and Jordan will 
refer to them as "guests," but both sides accept the other,s 
designation.  During the HLWG, he urged members to 
acknowledge the burden Iraqi refugees place on the Syrian and 
Jordanian governments.  Despite political problems countries 
may have with Syria and Jordan, said Guterres, "solidarity 
and appreciation" for the two countries, efforts was 
important.  In both meetings, Guterres also noted recent 
progress on obtaining Syrian visas for Department of Homeland 
Security officers, who will shortly begin conducting asylum 
interviews in UNHCR offices in Damascus.  He also called the 
resettlement of Palestinians who had been living in Iraq to 
Brazil and Chile a "breakthrough," but expressed continuing 
concern for the Palestinian community in Baghdad. 
 
¶3. (SBU) "The key element missing" in the Iraqi refugee issue 
is the Iraqi government, said Guterres.  He shared his view 
that President Talabani and FM Zebari have been fully 
cooperative, and blamed PM Maliki for the Iraqi government,s 
refusal to address the refugee issue.  One example was the 
refusal by the Iraqi government to disburse its 25 million 
dollar pledge to aid the refugees.  Guterres blamed PM Maliki 
personally for this refusal.  In follow-up questions during 
the HLWG meeting, Guterres said PM Maliki and his advisers 
believe that the Iraqi refugees in Syria and Jordan are 
Sunni, and therefore they would not assist them.  This was 
problematic on two levels, said Guterres.  First, a 
significant number of refugees are Shia.  Second, even if 
many refugees are Sunni, they are still Iraqi.  The Iraqi 
government,s abdication of its responsibility towards the 
refugees was "very serious" and "dramatic," said Guterres. 
He concluded, "It is inconceivable that we create a new 
Palestinian problem."  The problem, said Guterres, is PM 
Maliki,s "strong sectarian agenda." 
 
INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS 
 
¶4. (SBU) According to UNHCR, approximately 2.3 million Iraqi 
citizens are internally displaced, with over a million Iraqis 
displaced since February 2006.  Guterres said the Iraqi 
government is assisting IDPs, in stark contrast to their 
noninvolvement with refugees.  Lack of capacity was a 
pressing issue, as well as the inability of the Iraqi 
bureaucracy to handle these internal population transfers. 
 
¶5. (SBU) In his meeting with Amb Khalilzad, Guterres admitted 
that the effort of the UN,s humanitarian and reconstruction 
agencies to address the IDP problem has been inadequate, 
attributing its anemic performance to security limitations 
(both the UN's ability to move around Iraq and ceilings on 
staffing).  He expressed strong support, however, for newly 
appointed UNAMI deputy SRSG for economic and humanitarian 
affairs, David Shearer, who is also serving as the UN's 
Humanitarian Coordinator.  Guterres said UNHCR ispressing to 
expand its presence in Baghdad, and noted that it was 
difficult to move the UN family from a risk-averse to 
risk-management posture.
