"Israel and The Palestinians Resume Negotiations" 
 
Business-oriented Valor Economico editorialized (11/29): "The 
Annapolis Summit ended with the already exhaustively repeated 
promise that both Israelis and Palestinians will seriously engage in 
efforts to resolve their differences, bring peace to the Middle East 
and establish coexistence between two sovereign states. It is not 
much, but is the maximum George W. Bush, Mahmoud Abbas and Ehud 
Olmert, three weak and unpopular leaders, are capable of obtaining 
today. Moreover, it is better to have historical rivals looking for 
a solution for their problems on the negotiation table than bombing 
each other.... The strategy of looking for a landmark to conclude 
his administration may be Bush's only opportunity left to provide 
some breath to a Republican candidate in the presidential elections. 
It is one of Bush's few trump cards, although his intransigent 
support of Israel may destroy even some sincere intentions.... As 
soon as the preparatory committee meets on December 12, all problems 
will resume their brutal complexity.... The likelihood of a failure 
is enormous, but any chance for peace is better than nothing."
