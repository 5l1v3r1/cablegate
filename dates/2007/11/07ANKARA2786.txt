In Today's Papers 
 
Basbug: Turkey in Process of Implementing Cross Border Operation 
All papers report Turkish Land Forces Commander General Ilker 
Basbug's comments that Turkey is "in the process of implementing" a 
cross-border operation against the PKK in northern Iraq, but "when 
or how" it will be implemented is "another issue."  Basbug said the 
Turkish military has been doing cross-border incursions for years 
and it has been successful so far.  "It is wrong to think that 
terrorism will be eliminated with a cross-border operation, but it 
is also wrong to think that such an operation will not yield 
results," Basbug emphasized.  General Basbug also appealed to the 
Turkish press to "leave the decision-makers in peace during this 
process." 
 
Erdogan Opposes Lifting Kurdish DTP's Immunity 
All papers report Prime Minister Erdogan statements that his party 
will not support the MHP motion to lift the parliamentary immunity 
of the pro-Kurdish DTP deputies so that they can be prosecuted.  "If 
they find themselves outside the parliament, we would be sending 
them to the mountains," Erdogan stressed.  The PM also called on the 
DTP to choose democracy over armed struggle. 
 
'Jerusalem Meeting' in Istanbul Demands Liberation of Palestine 
Milliyet, Sabah, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Zaman and others report on the 
Jerusalem Meeting in Istanbul, which was organized by 
Islamist-oriented Turkish NGOs and attended by 3000 members of 
radical Islamist groups from 60 countries.  The members of the 
conference condemned Israel and called for the liberation of 
Palestine.  Representatives of Hamas, al-Fatah and the Jerusalem 
Movement took part in the meeting.  Reportedly, the participants 
said that the Annapolis meeting to be held in the US was designed to 
liquidate the Palestinian state. 
 
Armenian Daily: Turkey Partially Closes Air Corridor for Armenian 
Flights 
Mainstream Milliyet reports the Armenian daily Azg claims Turkey has 
partially closed its air corridor for Armenian flights between 
Yerevan and Aleppo and Beirut.  Armenian Airlines "Armavia" said 
Turkey did not provide specifics other than "technical reasons" for 
the closure.  The Armenian Civic Aviation Institution said Turkey 
did not close its airspace, and that flights from Yerevan to 
Istanbul and other European cities continue.  Azg writes that the 
partial closure is Ankara's response to the developments concerning 
efforts for international recognition of the alleged genocide 
against Armenians in Ottoman Turkey in 1915.  Milliyet says if the 
reports of closure are correct, it would mean the first serious 
Turkish sanction against Armenia. 
 
Gul to Pakistan to Meet Musharraf, Bhutto 
Mainstream Hurriyet reports that President Abdullah Gul plans to 
travel to Islamabad next month to meet President Pervez Musharraf, 
opposition leader Benazir Bhutto and other opposition 
representatives in an effort to help resolve the political crisis in 
Pakistan.  A Turkish Foreign Ministry (MFA) source said the date for 
the visit has not been fixed yet.  The US Administration has 
welcomed Turkish efforts for defusing political tensions in 
Pakistan, according to Hurriyet. 
 
Editorial Opinion on Annapolis Summit, the PKK 
Ferai Tinc commented in mainstream Hurriyet (11/16): "The Ankara 
Forum prompted international expectations to rise for Turkey's 
ability as a peacemaker.  To a certain extent, Turkey is fulfilling 
these expectations.  Because of its policies of good relations with 
its neighbors, Turkey is often called upon by regional actors for 
assistance.  Secretary Rice reiterated the importance of 
international support for success at the Annapolis conference, 
highlighting the importance of Turkey's role.  Next week, the 
invitee list will be announced and it is very possible that Turkey 
will be included.  The agenda of the meeting is not clear yet, but

foreign ministers of the EU Countries will discuss the issue on 
Monday.  The Annapolis Conference is like a knife's edge.  Maybe 
this is the last chance for moderate politics to win against 
radicalism.  If this conference is not successful, then there will 
be no future either for the West Bank or for Mahmoud Abbas.  The 
sounds of war supporters will be heard from everywhere." 
 
Bilal Cetin commented in the mainstream Vatan (11/16):  "Following 
the Bush-Erdogan meeting on November 5, no details were disclosed 
other than President Bush declaring that PKK an enemy of the US and 
that to eliminate the PKK, intelligence will be shared.  Before he 
left for Prague, PM Erdogan told journalists that 'there is no 
possibility of a cross-border operation at the moment.  Our priority 
is for the weapons to be laid down'.  These remarks explain that, 
following his meeting with Bush, Erdogan is waiting for the PKK to 
lay down its arms.  This means the US doesn't support Turkey's CBO 
into northern Iraq, but rather wants improved relations between 
Turkey and the northern Iraqi Administration.  At the same time, the 
US is aware that if terrorist activities continue, a CBO is 
inevitable.  That is why it favors a formula that doesn't require a 
cross border operation.  The PKK should be forced to disarm and 
Kurdish leaders Barzani and Talabani must support this effort. 
Currently, Peshmerge units are intensifying their activities along 
the border and the PKK is under intense pressure to disarm.  Turks 
want Kurds to understand that if the PKK does not disarm, the US and 
the Iraqi Administrations will support a cross border operation.. 
Therefore, the reason for postponing any operation is to give the US 
and Kurdish Regional Authority time to disarm the PKK."
