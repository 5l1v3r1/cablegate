SUBJECT: German Out-Of-Area Deployment Update 
 
REF:  Berlin 1822 
 
¶1. (SBU) As of late October, Germany had 6,737 military personnel in 
out-of-area deployments, plus an additional 600 dedicated for 
SACEUR's Balkans Operational Reserve Force (ORF) and 3,100 for the 
NATO Response Force (NRF).  All military out-of-area (OOA) 
deployments, with the exception of those in support of UN observer 
missions, require parliamentary approval.  A law regulates the 
parliamentary process, allowing expedited procedures only for 
non-controversial deployments.  What follows is a brief run-down on 
Germany's current OOA deployments.  (Note: OOA deployments are 
defined as deployments outside the territory of the NATO member 
states. End Note.) 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Bundeswehr currently has 3,057 military personnel 
operating under ISAF in Afghanistan based on a one-year combined 
mandate approved by the Bundestag October 12.  This combined mandate 
includes deployment of six Tornado reconnaissance aircraft, which 
were previously covered by a separate mandate first approved in 
March 2007.  The troop ceiling for the combined mandate is 3,500, 
which is simply a merger of the previously separate troop ceilings 
for ISAF (3,000) and the Tornados (500).  However, because the 
Tornados only require about 200 troops, the merger automatically 
creates additional headroom for Germany to take on additional tasks. 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) The German government has announced its intention to use 
this additional troop capacity to boost the Bundeswehr's involvement 
in the training of the Afghan National Army (ANA).  Some ideas under 
consideration include expanding the current drivers and mechanics 
school in Kabul into a logisticians' training center, cooperating 
with France in setting up an NCO academy in Kabul and setting up 
specialty military training schools in the northern region. 
Assuming the stand-up of a new ANA brigade in the north (scheduled 
for August 2008), Germany also plans to contribute four additional 
embedded training teams (Operational Mentoring and Liaison Teams -- 
OMLTs).  Germany currently leads one OMLT (for a maneuver battalion) 
and contributes to two others (for a corps HQ and a brigade HQ). 
Germany also plans to build garrisons for the new ANA brigade in the 
North. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Germany has been active in ISAF since the operation's 
creation in January 2002.  Germany currently commands ISAF's 
northern region (RC-North), where it leads two of the five 
Provincial Reconstruction Teams (Kunduz and Feyzabad) as well as the 
Forward Support Base in Mazar-E-Sharif.  The ISAF mandate limits 
normal Bundeswehr operations to Kabul and RC-North, but allows 
temporary deployments to other parts of the country on a 
case-by-case basis.  In early May, at the request of ISAF, Defense 
Minister Jung approved the temporary deployment (three to four 
weeks) of a three-man psychological operations team to southern 
Afghanistan.  German radio operators have also been deployed 
temporarily to provide communication support to Regional Command 
South in Kandahar.  However, MOD has thus far not allowed German 
OMLTs to accompany their ANA units on deployments outside the north. 
 Meanwhile, the ISAF mandate allows the reconnaissance aircraft to 
operate throughout Afghanistan, but restricts the distribution of 
the resulting information to OEF to cases where it directly supports 
ISAF operations. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) The current parliamentary mandate for OEF, which expires 
November 15, allows the deployment of up to a total of 1,800 
personnel.  Currently, there are 246 sailors (226 in September) and 
one frigate under OEF, operating around the Horn of Africa.  The 
mandate authorizes the deployment of up to 100 German Special Forces 
(KSK) in Afghanistan.  Reportedly, no KSK have been deployed to 
Afghanistan under OEF in more than two years, leading some 
politicians to question the utility of maintaining this part of the 
mandate. 
 
¶6. (SBU) OEF remains unpopular in Germany due to misperceptions of 
the mission as a strictly combat operation and its association with 
civilian casualties.  Nevertheless, the mandate appears headed for 
renewal on November 15, now that the leadership of the junior party 
in the Grand Coalition government, the Social Democratic Party, has 
succeeded in rallying their members in favor of it at the October 
26-28 national party conference.  The government intends to reduce 
the overall OEF troop ceiling to 1,400 in the new mandate, but this 
will remain far above the actual number of troops deployed.

¶7. (SBU) While the SPD party convention was supportive of OEF, it 
requested that the government evaluate whether OEF could be mandated 
through a UNSCR (rather than continuing to have it based on the 
self-defense provisions of Article 51 of the UN Charter).  The 
convention also expressed the view that OEF should continue to 
shrink in favor of ISAF -- through, for example, the transfer of the 
ANA training mission to ISAF.  Extension of the OEF mandate is 
expected to be more difficult next year, in the run-up to the 2009 
national parliamentary election, given that popular support in 
Germany for the mission is already so low. 
 
------------------- 
Kosovo Force (KFOR) 
------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) Germany currently has 2,218 military personnel (compared to 
2,438 in September) in KFOR, ar below that allowed under the 
parliamentary mandate (8,500).  The mandate is extended 
automatcally each year unless there is a change to the UNC 
Resolution framework for the Kosovo Force.  It remains unclear 
whether a new or amended parliamentary mandate will be required or 
requested in the event of a unilateral declaration of independence 
by Kosovo. 
 
----------------------------------- 
European Union Force (EUFOR) Bosnia 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) Germany currently has 316 soldiers (compared to 483 in 
September) in Bosnia as part of the EU's Operation ALTHEA.  The 
mandate, last amended December 1, allows up to 2,400 military 
personnel.  This operation extends automatically unless there is a 
change to its underlying UNSC resolution.  Over the last several 
months the German government has been slowly reducing its military 
presence in coordination with other allies, but that process has 
been suspended recently in light of current problems in implementing 
reform measures mandated by the Dayton Peace agreement. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶10. (SBU) Germany leads UNIFIL's naval component and has 805 
military personnel deployed (compared to 830 in September).  The 
Bundestag extended the mandate on September 12 for an additional 
year, with a reduced troop ceiling of 1,400 (down from 2,400).  The 
mandate authorizes the Bundeswehr to continue leading UNIFIL's naval 
component until February 2008. 
 
------------------------------ 
Sudan (UNAMID, UNMIS and AMIS) 
------------------------------ 
 
¶11. (SBU) Germany currently has 37 military observers (compared to 
38 in September) in the UN Mission in Sudan (UNMIS), monitoring the 
implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.  The parliament 
imposed a caveat barring military observers from going to Darfur 
without prior consultation with the Bundestag Foreign Relations 
Committee's chairman and ranking members.  The mandate allows the 
participation of up to 75 military observers.  The current UNMIS 
mandate expires November 15, but it is expected to be extended 
unchanged. 
 
¶12. (SBU) While there is parliamentary mandate for the Bundeswehr to 
deploy transport aircraft and up to 200 troops in support of the 
African (Union) Mission in Sudan (AMIS), this mandate has gone 
practically unused in the last year, with the AU requesting only 
sporadic assistance from Germany.  The current six-month AMIS 
mandate expires December 14. 
 
¶13. (SBU) While welcoming passage of UNSCR 1769 (which establishes 
the UN Assistance Mission in Darfur, UNAMID), the government has 
ruled out additional troops or assets for the new hybrid UN/AU 
force, beyond the limits in the existing UNMIS and AMIS mandates. 
The government has recently resisted taking on any additional 
military commitments in Darfur or elsewhere for fear it could 
undermine support for renewal of the Afghanistan (ISAF, OEF) 
mandates.  This reluctance was demonstrated most recently in 
Germany's decision to forego participation in the ESDP operation in 
Chad.  However, once the OEF mandate is safely renewed as expected 
in mid-November, the government may become more open to providing 
support for other missions.  For example, given that air lift 
support for AMIS has been unused for a while, there might be some 
headroom for Germany to provide these assets.  The German government 
is currently preparing a new mandate that would allow the Bundeswehr 
to shift assets currently allocated to UNMIS and AMIS to UNAMID. 
Approval of the mandate is expected November 15.

Georgia (UNOMIG) 
---------------- 
 
¶14. (SBU) Germany has been part of the UN Observer Mission in 
Georgia (UNOMIG) since 1998 and currently has 12 personnel (compared 
to 16 in September) stationed there, most of whom are medical 
personnel and military observers.  To the meet a UN request for 
additional medical personnel, the German cabinet decided August 8 to 
raise the personnel ceiling for this mission from 13 to 20. 
 
----------------------- 
Other minor deployments 
----------------------- 
 
¶15. (SBU) Two military observers serve in Ethiopia and Eritrea for 
the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE).  One 
German military observer is seconded to the United Nation Assistance 
Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA).  The Bundeswehr has seconded 41 
military personnel to Strategic Medical Evacuation 
(STRATAIRMEDEVAC), for which no parliamentary mandate is required, 
as it is not defined as an armed deployment and the aircraft are on 
stand-by in Germany. 
 
----------------------- 
Other force commitments 
----------------------- 
 
¶16. (SBU) The Bundeswehr currently has 600 soldiers dedicated as 
SACEUR's Operational Reserve Force (ORF) for the Balkans and 3,100 
soldiers for the ninth rotation of the NATO Response Force (NRF). 
 
------------------------- 
Bundeswehr transformation 
------------------------- 
 
¶17. (SBU) The Bundeswehr is currently undergoing a transformation 
process, the goal of which is to be able to send up to 14,000 
soldiers to as many as five different theaters for stabilization 
missions by 2010.  The Bundeswehr will be reduced from its 
pre-transformation level of 270,000 to a final strength of 250,000 
(162,300 Army, 62,700 Air Force and 25,000 Navy).  The new 
Bundeswehr will be composed of three different groups: 35,000 for 
intervention forces, 70,000 for stabilization forces and 147,000 for 
support forces.  Part of the Bundeswehr's transformation is a 
comprehensive rebasing program, which is also intended to be 
completed by 2010.  Moreover, transformation includes the 
procurement of new equipment to fill capability gaps, mainly in the 
fields of strategic air lift, network centric warfare and armored 
vehicles.  Mainly due to limited funding (Germany spends just 1.2 
percent of its GDP on defense, with few prospects of significant 
increases in the future), the equipping side of transformation is 
behind schedule.
