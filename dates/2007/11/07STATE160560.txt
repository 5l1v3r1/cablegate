SUBJECT: INVITATION TO GSA TO ATTEND GNEP STEERING COMMITTEE MEETING 
IN VIENNA IN DECEMBER 
 
REF: PRETORIA 3674 
 
¶1.  THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST FOR EMBASSY OFFICERS TO DELIVER TALKING 
POINTS (PARAGRAPH 3 BELOW) INVITING GSA OFFICIALS TO PARTICIPATE AS 
OBSERVERS during the first meeting of the Steering Group for the 
Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) in Vienna, Austria, from 11 
to 13 December 2007.  Request that Embassy Officers draw upon the 
following talking points during a meeting with DME officials, 
preferably with Tseliso Maqubela, Chief Director of Nuclear Affairs. 
Points may be left as a non-paper. 
 
¶2. BEGIN TALKING POINTS 
 
U.S. GNEP representative, Ed McGinnis, has been attempting to make 
contact with the point of contact (Tseliso Maqubela) that South 
Africa identified during our last bilateral discussion with 
Ambassador Abdul Minty in Vienna, Austria, during the IAEA General 
Conference.  However, to date, Mr. McGinnis has been unsuccessful in 
making contact. 
 
We would like to extend an invitation to South Africa to send 
representatives as observers to the first meeting of the GNEP 
Steering Group in Vienna, Austria, from 11 to 13 December. 
 
We believe that South Africa would be a strong and valued addition to 
the group of 17 nations that have already become full Partners of 
GNEP. 
 
If you are able to attend the GNEP Steering Group meeting, we believe 
that it would be worthwhile to hold at a bilateral side meeting with 
the South African attendees to discuss the important issues related 
to GNEP that you have raised. 
 
For example, South Africa has expressed concern that signing the GNEP 
SOP might limit your freedom of action.  However, the SOP says that 
states participating in GNEP would not give up any rights. 
 
South Africa has also expressed concern that the SOP singles out 
"proliferation resistance" as a goal only for nuclear power reactors 
for developing countries.  However, the Generation IV International 
Forum (GIF) has already made proliferation resistance a goal for all 
advanced nuclear power reactors.  By referencing GIF, the SOP 
incorporates this goal and does not single out developing countries. 
 
The USG hopes that South Africa is able to accept this invitation, so 
that you may be fully informed about the proposed future activities 
of GNEP and so that we will have a chance to directly address South 
African concerns. 
 
END TALKING POINTS
