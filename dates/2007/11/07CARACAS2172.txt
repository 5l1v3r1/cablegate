¶1. (C)  SUMMARY:  President Hugo Chavez met November 8 with 
FARC representative Ivan Marquez and Colombian Senator Piedad
Cordoba.  Although highly anticipated, the Bolivarian 
Republic of Venezuela (BRV) gave the Colombian government no 
official prior notification.  In an unstructured press 
availability following the meeting, Chavez said this would be 
the first in a series of meetings with the FARC and issued a 
vague promise to meet FARC supreme commander Manuel 
Marulanda.  Chavez said publicly he hopes to be able to 
provide proof of life for French/Colombian dual national 
Ingrid Betancourt during his November 20 meeting with French 
President Sarkozy.  French embassy officials rate the 
likelihood of his providing such evidence at about 60%. 
According to the French DCM the FARC  may also provide proof 
of life for the three AmCit hostages.  END SUMMARY. 

¶2.  (SBU)  FARC Representative Ivan Marquez and Colombian 
Senator Piedad Cordoba met with the press outside the 
Miraflores presidential palace following their November 8 
meeting with Chavez.  Cordoba said that although many 
difficult issues remain, &an important door had been 
opened.8  She added that proof of life of the 45 hostages in 
FARC hands was &the important next step8.  Chavez asserted 
that Manuel "Sureshot" Marulanda had ordered field FARC field 
commanders to send the Venezuelan leader proof of life, 
adding that he hoped to have proof of Colombian Presidential 
candidate Ingrid Betancourt's safety before he traveled to 
Paris on November 20. 

¶3.  (C)  French Deputy Chief of Mission Dominique Mas 
(Protect) told PolCouns November 13 that Chavez had received 
a special French emissary to discuss the negotiations and 
that Chavez felt he could produce proof of life for 
Franco-Colombian Ingrid Betancourt and possibly the three 
U.S. DEA contractors for his November 20 meeting with French 
President Nicolas Sarkozy.  While the French estimate Chavez 
has a 60% chance of meeting that goal, they conceded that 
"something is happening" and think that recent FARC reverses 
in the field, (REFTEL) combined with the letter from Simon 
Trinidad and Sonia have put the FARC in the position of 
needing to cut a deal.  Mas speculated that women, children 
and infirmed FARC hostages might be exchanged for imprisoned 
FARC females; adding, "If Chavez can't do it, who will?" 

¶4.  (SBU)  Chavez hedged his chances of success by calling 
the open door "large and heavy." He said that a meeting with 
FARC leader Marulanda was on both of their agendas and that 
only, "a date, place and time" were needed. FARC emissary 
Marquez added that the meeting would take place in the El 
Yari jungle of Colombia's Caqueta department, where Chavez 
would find Marulanda "leading fighters." The Colombian Peace 
Commission indicated that Chavez had not informed them of the 
meeting with the FARC (REFTEL) as required by the 
facilitation agreement and only heard of it from the media.
