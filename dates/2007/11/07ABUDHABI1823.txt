¶1. (SBU) On October 29, Under Secretary of Treasury for 
International Affairs David McCormick, accompanied by Ambassador, 
discussed both the Financial Action Task Force's guidance on Iran 
and the U.S. designations of Iranian entities and individuals with 
UAE Central Bank Governor Sultan Nasser Al-Suwaidi.  U/S McCormick 
stressed that the USG's designations were aimed at implementing 
UNSCR 1737 and 1747 obligations and to protect the U.S. financial 
system from financial activity supporting ongoing Iranian 
proliferation and terrorism activities.  U/S McCormick encouraged 
the UAEG to take similar actions and to caution its financial 
institutions about dealings with Iranian banks. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Al-Suwaidi said he believed the U.S. and UN sanctions were 
having an impact on Iran and Iranian businesses.  He noted that the 
UAE had seen a decline in financial transfers from Iran in August, 
adding that transfers to Iran were largely from Iranian businesses 
operating in the UAE.  Al-Suwaidi noted, rhetorically, that there 
were two possibilities: either the Iranians were retrenching 
economically, or were diverting their business away from the UAE and 
GCC countries.  He noted that this countered USG concerns that Iran 
would transfer its business to the UAE as European markets closed to 
it.  Ambassador, Econchief, and Treasury Attach will continue to 
pursue this issue with UAEG authorities.
