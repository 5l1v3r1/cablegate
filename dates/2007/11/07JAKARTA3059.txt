SUBJECT: INDONESIA SENDING OUT CLIMATE ENVOYS BEFORE BALI COP-13 
 
¶1. (U) The Government of Indonesia (GOI) will be sending four senior 
climate change envoys to a number of key countries, including the 
U.S., in order to sound out other governments' positions and gather 
input for December's conference in Bali.  All four are advisors to 
Minister of Environment Rachmat Witoelar.  In the press, Witoelar 
said the envoys would meet with top leaders, including presidents or 
prime ministers of the targeted countries.  The envoys and their 
designated countries are: 
 
-- Former foreign minister Ali Alatas (India and Saudi Arabia); 
-- Former environment minister and Indonesian head of delegation for 
COP-13, Dr. Emil Salim (China and Japan); 
-- Former environment minister Nabiel Makarim (E.U. and Russia); 
and 
-- Former ambassador to the U.S. Sumadi Brotodiningrat (U.S., 
Canada, and Brazil). 
 
¶2. (SBU) We understand that Ambassador Brotodiningrat will travel to 
the U.S., Canada, and Brazil, on November 19-23, and we will provide 
additional details when they become available.  The other three 
envoys are also likely to travel to their designated countries in 
mid-to-late November. 
 
¶3. (SBU) According to our Ministry of Environment contacts, the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs issued a decree (Decree No. 13), 
outlining the general mandate of these "Special Envoys": 
 
-- To gather substantive input from targeted countries to ensure the 
success of COP-13; 
-- To request supplementary financial support from donor countries 
and international organizations for the GOI's COP-13 budget; and 
-- To seek out partnerships related to capacity building and 
environmentally friendly technologies. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The GOI held an initial planning meeting on November 2 to 
discuss their envoys' missions.  However, they will only finalize 
details after President Yudhoyono chairs a preparatory meeting with 
the COP-13 Steering and Organizing Committees in Bali within the 
next two weeks.  In the meantime, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
has sent cables to Indonesian diplomatic missions in the target 
countries instructing them to begin arranging tentative schedules 
for the envoys.
