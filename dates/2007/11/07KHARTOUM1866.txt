¶1. (SBU) Soon after the arrival of 135 Chinese engineer peacekeepers 
on November 24 in Nyala, media reported the Justice and Equality 
Movement (JEM) rebel group threatened to attack the Chinese 
engineers.  According to the media, JEM leader Khalil Ibrahim 
Muhhamed said, "They are not welcome...they can never come into our 
area."  "I am not saying I will attack them. I will not say I will 
not attack them," he said. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On November 27, JEM spokesmen Ahmed Hussein Adam, told 
media that despite his peoples rejection of the Chinese troops, his 
movement would not attack them.  "In spite of the fact that Darfur 
people do not welcome the Chinese troops who are the main ally of 
Khartoum government and its principle provider of weapons, we will 
not target the Chinese peacekeepers." 
 
¶3. (SBU) Media reported November 28 the Chinese ambassador to 
Khartoum, Li Cheng Wen saying, "Up to now there has been no 
incident, but we are deeply concerned about the matter." 
 
¶4. (SBU) Embassy poloff presented a copy of the November 27 State 
Department press release condemning the threats against the Chinese 
engineering unit to Chinese embassy political officers Shen Ang and 
Yu Chunhua on November 28.  When asked about possible Chinese 
responses to the JEM threats, Ang said that the threats are against 
all UNAMID peacekeepers of which the Chinese peacekeepers are a part 
and that it was expected that UNAMID is responsible for their 
protection.  He added that these troops are not infantry but 
engineers who are there to support the entire Darfur Peace 
Agreement. 
 
¶5. (SBU) On November 28, Post issued to the Khartoum press an Arabic 
language translation of the Department of State press release 
condemning the threat of violence against the Chinese engineering 
unit. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment: Embassy poloffs attempted to reach by phone 
November 27 contacts in the JEM to express the U.S. condemnation of 
the remarks.  We will continue to reach out both from Khartoum and 
El Fasher to pass this message.  Due to the splintering of rebel 
movements, it is possible that any of the factions of the JEM or the 
SLA will attempt to attack the Chinese troops.  They make an 
inviting target given China's support of Khartoum, and UNAMID will 
need to plan for their security accordingly.
