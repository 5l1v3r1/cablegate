with Grzegorz Kozuba of the MFA,s UN Department. Kozuba 
informed us that Poland decided to support the Swiss

proposal to enter into a mutual support agreement for 
candidates to international organizations. Therefore, the GOP

Switzerland will support the Polish candidate the upcoming 
election for the International Maritime Organization.
