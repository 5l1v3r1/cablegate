READY TO STRIKE OFF-SHORE DEAL 
 
 
¶1.  (U) Sensitive but unclassified.  Business sensitive.  Not for 
public Internet. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  ConocoPhillips and Lukoil are in the very final 
stages of negotiating a product-sharing agreement (PSA) for the 
Ordekli (Block 21) and Ogurji (Blocks 19 and 20) offshore fields. 
The PSA for the Ordekli field deal, with Lukoil as the operator, may 
be signed during the Turkmenistan International Oil and Gas 
Exhibition (TIOGE).  ConocoPhillips will operate the Ogurji field. 
Each consortium member will have a 50% stake in both fields.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
PSA OR PSAS? 
 
¶3.  (SBU) ConocoPhillips and Lukoil will have two separate 
agreements, one for Ordekli and the other for Ogurjli field.  The 
partners will have an equal 50% stake in both production areas. 
Under this deal, the Government of Turkmenistan will have a right to 
acquire up to 30% of the shares.  This would require Turkmenistan to 
set up a national operating company, similar to KazMunaiGaz of 
Kazakhstan. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The PSA's content seems to have stayed within the 
framework of the previous model agreement.  However, the PSA with 
ConocoPhillips/Lukoil will not have a lifting provision.  (NOTE: 
According to the original model PSA adopted in 1997, Turkmenistan 
may require the contractor to arrange the sale of Turkmenistan's 
share of petroleum.  The contractor was entitled to recover 
associated costs.  END NOTE.)  Turkmenistan also requires more 
social and training elements in the newly negotiated PSAs. 
 
CONOCOPHILLIPS TO OPEN ASHGABAT OFFICE 
 
¶5.  (SBU) According to a ConocoPhillips representative currently 
visiting Ashgabat, the company has already registered ConocoPhillips 
Turkmenistan Exploration Inc in the United States, and the company 
will start working in Turkmenistan after ConocoPhillips signs its 
PSA.  ConocoPhillips will open an initial Ashgabat office in the Ak 
Altyn Hotel/Office Center.  ConocoPhilips' CEO plans to visit 
Turkmenistan during the TIOGE (November 13-15). 
 
¶6.  (SBU) COMMENT: The ConocoPhillips contract sets the first new 
precedent for a major Western company entering the Turkmenistan 
market in the last ten years.  It will have a positive impact on the 
image of the country's leadership and investment regime.  The deal 
will not only attract a host of subcontractors, but also send a 
signal to other oil and gas companies that Turkmenistan is now in a 
position to offer attractive commercial provisions and assurances of 
political stability.  Additionally, ConocoPhillips has substantial 
experience working in Kazakhstan that it can share with Turkmen 
counterparts.  END COMMENT.
