(SBU) Poloff delivered reftel demarche on November 8 to Ihab 
Soliman, MFA Office of International Organizations, who 
promised to promptly discuss the request with Egyptian 
officials in London.  Soliman was confident that Egypt would 
be able to support U.S. candidacy, given that U.S. candidacy 
is essentially uncontested because only the incumbent 
candidates in category "A" were seeking re-election.
