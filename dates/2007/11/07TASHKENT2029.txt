REF: STATE 150999 \
 \
Classified By: CLASSIFIED BY ECON OFF B. OLSEN FOR REASONS 1.4 (B, D). \
 \
¶1. (C) The natural resources sector is strictly controlled by \
the Government of Uzbekistan (GOU).  Its equipment and \
infrastructure is antiquated and, out of economic necessity, \
it relies on foreign firms to help extract and export \
resources.  Foreign firms operate in joint ventures with \
state-owned companies, and hold minority stakes.  Natural \
resources, especially natural gas and gold, are Uzbekistan's \
most lucrative industries and attract the attention of the \
elite who vie to profit privately.  Due to Uzbekistan's \
corrupt and arbitrary business environment, foreign firms \
encounter many difficulties.  In 2006 and 2007, the GOU \
aggressively pushed out numerous foreign companies, the \
majority of which worked with natural resources. \
 \
Hydrocarbon Sector \
------------------ \
 \
¶2. (SBU) U.S. companies are not involved in the direct \
extraction of hydrocarbons in Uzbekistan.  The few U.S. \
companies that work in the sector perform seismic surveys, \
refine petroleum products and sell equipment.  To date, these \
companies have not lost market access due to resource \
nationalism.  However, some companies have reported \
discrimination in the tendering process based on their \
affiliation with the U.S. \
 \
¶3. (SBU) Numerous state-owned and partially state-owned \
petroleum companies operate in Uzbekistan as joint ventures. \
These include Gazprom, Lukoil, Petronas, the China National \
Petroleum Corporation, and the National Iranian Oil Company. \
While some companies, such as Lukoil, report problems with \
the GOU, to date these companies have not completely pulled \
up operations. \
 \
¶4. (SBU) In 2007, China's Sinopec pulled out of a \
non-functioning joint venture with state-owned Uzbekneftegaz. \
 The joint venture, created in 2003, planned to invest USD \
113 million to rehabilitate oil fields and explore for new \
deposits.  Sinopec cited high local resources taxes as the \
main reason for its departure. \
 \
Mineral Resources Sector \
------------------------ \
 \
¶5. (SBU) Foreign companies in the mineral resources sector \
have had considerable problems with the government in the \
past two years.  The GOU expropriated Newmont, a U.S. gold \
mining company, in 2006 from its joint venture that processed \
gold tailings.  Before arbitration hearings began, the \
disagreement was resolved in September 2007.  The GOU bought \
Newmont out of the joint venture, though for a sum much less \
than Newmont's expected profit over the remaining life of the \
joint venture. \
 \
¶6. (C) The GOU attempted the same with Oxus, a British \
company, in 2006.  Oxus struck a deal with the Uzbek-Swiss \
company Zeromax.  Zeromax bought 16 percent of Oxus and the \
British company's problems ended.  (Note: Zeromax \
unofficially belongs to President Karimov's daughter, Gulnora \
Karimova.  It is registered in Switzerland, but in practice \
is an Uzbek company.) \
 \
¶7.  (SBU) U.S-owned Nukem has an exclusive contract to export \
the majority of Uzbek uranium.  It encountered problems in \
2007, including delay of payments and the GOU refusal to \
abide by the contractual provisions.  While the situation is \
improved, it could again deteriorate at any time.  In October \
2007, the GOU expropriated the Israeli company Metal-Tech \
Ltd. that processed molybdenum and tungsten.  The dispute is \
unresolved. \
 \
Comment: Who Gains? \
------------------- \
 \
¶8. (C) The GOU is not necessarily predatory towards foreign \

 \
 \
firms in the natural resources sector.  However, if a foreign \
company enjoys strong profits, it comes to the attention of \
elite Uzbeks who want a share of the profit.  Two elite \
figures have the most to gain from natural resources: Gulnora \
Karimova and Minister of Finance Rustam Azimov.  Zeromax is \
the "middle man" for all oil and gas contracts, thereby \
interfacing with Gazprom and Lukoil, which siphon 80 percent \
of Uzbekistan's natural gas exports to Russia.  Through \
Karimova's control of Zeromax, she is squarely in control of \
the hydrocarbon sector.  Azimov reportedly led the state \
seizure of Newmont and Metal-Tech Ltd., and is in the \
position to unofficially profit from the GOU's control. \
