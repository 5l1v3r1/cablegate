¶1. (SBU) Global Affairs officer delivered reftel demarche 
November 5 to German Finance Ministry Financial Crimes Desk 
Officer Kristina Wogatzki and MFA International Financial 
Policy Desk Officer Claudia Schuett.  According to Wogatzki, 
the German Financial Monitoring Association (BaFin) 
distributed the German-language text of the FATF 
statement/guidance on Iran - along with an advisory from the 
German Government to exercise enhanced due diligence with 
respect to all Iran-related transactions - to the German 
Central Credit Committee (Zentraler Kreditausschuss, or ZKA) 
and major German banking associations in late October. 
Wogatzki noted that the ZKA and banking associations were 
instructed to disseminate the information to their member 
financial institutions. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Schuett said the German Government remains 
interested in providing clear, precise guidance to German 
banks.  She asked whether Treasury had provided specific 
information to U.S. banks on how to determine whether Iranian 
companies/banks are affiliated with entities of concern, such 
as the IRGC.
