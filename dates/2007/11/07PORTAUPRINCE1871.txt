¶2. (SBU) PolCouns drew from reftel points in a meeting 
November 23 with Ministry of Foreign Affairs Political 
Affairs Director Wiener Jean-Baptiste.  PolCouns emphasized 
how these three committees over the years have made no useful 
contribution to achieving a two-state solution.  In 
particular, they have done nothing to help efforts supported 
by the UN itself through the Quartet to achieve this outcome. 
 Hence, their mandates should not be renewed.  PolCouns made 
a point to welcome Haiti's abstention on 61/116 and urged 
that Haiti change its yes votes on 61/22 and 61/23 to 
abstentions. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Jean-Baptiste said he would communicate these points 
to Foreign Minister Clerisme.  He would not commit to a 
change in Haiti's vote.  However, Jean-Baptiste responded 
strongly to reftel argument that the Anapolis conference 
presented an historic opportunity to advance toward the 
internationally recognized goals of two states, Israel and 
Palestine, living side by side in peace and security.  He 
said he was encouraged by the fact that numerous Arab 
countries historically at odds with Israel had pledged to 
attend Annapolis.  Jean-Baptiste made a follow-on phone call 
to PolCouns November 26 to express satisfaction that Syria 
had just pledged to participate.  PolCouns emphasized that 
there now exists the potential for real progress in the 
Middle East, which further highlights that these three UN 
bodies serve no useful role.
