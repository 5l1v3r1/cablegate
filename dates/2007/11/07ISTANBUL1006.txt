SUBJECT: EDIRNE FLOODS - AGAIN 
 
1.(U)  On November 20, flood waters poured into the 
provincial capital of Edirne, Turkey -- 150 kilometers west 
of Istanbul.  The flood, the result of a decision by the 
Bulgarian government to release excess water from Ivailovgrad 
Dam, inundated various roads and communities in the region. 
The Gendarmerie and divers from the Istanbul Civil Defense 
Department remain on the scene to address any emergencies and 
to distribute supplies to affected residents.  Despite the 
damage, the Bulgarian Embassy maintains that it gave plenty 
of warning to the Turkish government both of the pending 
release of water and of the potential flood risk posed.  The 
Turkish government has not/not requested international 
assistance. 
 
2.(U)  THE DAMAGE: On November 20, the Meric, Arda, and Tunca 
rivers crested in western Edirne province.  The combined flow 
flooded the Orhaniye-Elicili highway, Er Square, the Balkan 
military cemetery, Mehmetcik Tavern, the Hall of Justice, and 
various fishing and agricultural communities.  As a result of 
the floods, the Yalnizgoz, Fatih, and Kanuni bridges, as well 
as Turkey's largest border gates -- the Kapikule and 
Pazarkule -- were closed to traffic, thus stranding nearly 
7,000 residents in the Karaagac and Silivri areas of Edirne. 
The State Meteorology Department forecasts continued 
precipitation in the region and has issued further flood and 
landslide warnings.  That said, despite 300,000 YTL in aid 
from the Prime Minister's Office and the allocation of 
blankets, food, and medicine by the Istanbul Metropolitan 
Municipality the cost is expected to climb. 
 
3.(U)  AN ANNUAL EVENT: The flooding of the Meric is an 
annual occurrence; in fact, The State Waterworks Authority 
(DSI) cleared the banks of the Meric earlier this year in an 
attempt to prevent this very event.  The Bulgarians blame the 
Turks for any damage resulting from the flood, pointing to 
the Turkish government's failure to adequately prepare in 
advance.  The Turks -- Edirne Governor Nusret Miroglu in 
particular -- cite reinforcement work performed on dikes in 
2005, 2006, and 2007, as proof of preparation, and instead 
blame the damage on a discrepancy between the actual amount 
of water coming from Bulgaria and the much smaller amount of 
water the Bulgarians claimed they would release.  Regardless 
of what was said, by early morning on November 20 the Meric, 
flowing at a rate of 1,300 cubic meters per second, far 
beyond the normal rate of flow of 600 cubic meters per 
second, breached its banks for yet another year.
