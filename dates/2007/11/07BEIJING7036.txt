¶1. Key points at the November 8 MFA Press Briefing: 
 
-- China requested that Iran "respond positively" and "attach 
importance to" the concern of the international community. 
(Note: some news organizations stated that China "demanded" 
Iran respond positively.  The word in Chinese was "yaoqiu" 
which can be translated as either "demand" or "request."  The 
MFA interpreter said "request" when translating into English.) 
 
-- Reports on China's alleged banning of Bibles during the 
upcoming Olympic Games are "sheer rumors." 
 
-- Journalists "must abide by laws" and must be "punished in 
accordance with law" if they violate laws. 
 
-- Visits: Venezuelan FM Nicolas Maduro will visit November 
13-15. 
 
China Requests that Iran "Respond Positively" 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. At the November 8 regular MFA press briefing, MFA 
Spokesman Liu Jianchao, responding to a question on the 
Iranian President's reportedly calling Iran's nuclear program 
"irreversible," said China has noticed the developments and 
requested (yaoqiu) that Iran "respond positively" and "attach 
importance to" the concern of the international community. 
China hopes Iran will show flexibility in carrying out 
dialogue and consultation with relevant parties and that 
relevant parties pursue peaceful means, including dialogue 
and consultation, to settle this issue peacefully.  China 
will continue to play "a constructive role in this regard" 
and is willing to communicate with the UN and EU to push this 
issue forward to a "proper result." 
 
Reports of Olympic Bible Ban "Sheer Rumors" 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. After taking note of reports on China's alleged banning of 
Bibles during the upcoming Olympic Games, the spokesman 
characterized such reports as "sheer rumors," and expressed 
"dissatisfaction" with organizations spreading such rumors. 
The Government has made no such "stipulations or remarks," 
Liu said, and "always respects the freedom of religious 
beliefs of foreigners in China in accordance with the law." 
Foreigners entering China can bring religious publications, 
items or products for personal use, added Liu, and there will 
be no "stipulations" regarding Bibles in the Olympic Village. 
 
 
Group Calls for Release of Imprisoned Journalists 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶4. Asked about Reporters Without Borders' (RSF) call for the 
release of China's 33 imprisoned journalists, Liu responded 
that he did not know what facts the demand was based on, but 
said journalists "must abide by laws" and must be "punished 
in accordance with law" if they violate laws. 
 
¶5. Responding to a reporter's suggestion of recent pressure 
on foreign journalists from the Chinese police, Liu said he 
fully understands the reporter's concerns and will have his 
colleagues contact the public security departments for 
specific information.  Liu also suggested that either 
individuals involved in an incident described by the reporter 
were not aware of new regulations on foreign journalists or 
there was an implementation problem.  The MFA hopes it can 
strengthen communication if it was a misunderstanding on the 
journalists' side, and hopes foreign journalists can have 
"happy and smooth reporting" in China. 
 
Disablement Underway, Hope for Declaration 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶6. China has taken note of "relevant work" underway in the 
DPRK and hopes that it will be smoothly implemented and 
completed in accordance with the October 3 "joint document," 
Liu said when asked about DPRK disablement.  On the question 
of when North Korea's declaration will begin, Liu stated that 
the October 3 "joint document" has clear wording on DPRK 
declaration of nuclear programs which China hopes will be 
implemented. 
 
Afghanistan, Pakistan, Indonesia 
--------------------------------

¶7. China strongly condemns a recent suicide bombing in 
Afghanistan and expresses its condolences to the victims' 
families, Liu said in response to a reporter's question. 
Asked about comments made by President Bush on his support 
for Pakistani President Musharraf, Liu replied that U.S. 
policy toward Pakistan is up to the United States.  China's 
position is that the Pakistani Government and people are 
capable of settling their own problems and China hopes 
Pakistan can maintain stability and development.  The 
spokesman had not seen any news on a defense agreement 
between China and Indonesia and referred reporters to the 
Ministry of Defense for further information. 
 
Visits: Venezuelan FM Maduro, Lee Kuan Yew 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶8. Venezuelan FM Nicolas Maduro will visit November 13-15 at 
the invitation of FM Yang.  Former Singapore PM Lee Kuan Yew 
has plans to visit China, but the details are still under 
consultation.
