SUBJECT: RESPONSE TO GERMAN REQUEST FOR RECONSIDERATION OF 
IV PROGRAM FOR AFGHAN GOVERNOR 
 
REF: BERLIN 1886 
 
This cable is sensitive but unclassified.  Please handle 
accordingly. 
 
¶1. (SBU) Post appreciates Embassy Berlin's REFTEL message 
relaying the German government's sensitivities about the 
nomination of the Kunduz province governor, Mohammad Omar, 
for participation in the autumn International Visitor program. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Post would appreciate Embassy Berlin's conveying to 
the German government that the governor is not being 
considered for participation in an IV program this year.   It 
may be useful to note that Governor Omar enjoys President 
Karzai's confidence.  Whether or not he continues as Governor 
of Kunduz or is removed from that position during the 
anticipated round of governor changes, he is likely to 
continue to occupy Afghan leadership positions.  It may also 
be helpful to clarify that the International Visitor program 
is not a reward for performance but an educational 
experience.  It serves western interests by encouraging 
participating leaders' ( who in many cases are targeted due 
to their need for training) acceptance of modern principles 
of democratic governance and often has profound effects on 
behaviors.   Post believes Omar's participation in an 
International Visitor program at some point would be an 
opportunity to shape positively his perception of his role 
and responsibilities as a government official.  While we can 
inform the Germans he is not on the list for this year's IV 
program for governors, we do not rule out his participation 
in future IV programs.
