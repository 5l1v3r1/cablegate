SUBJECT: PANAMA: PRESIDENT TORRIJOS GRIPES THAT U.S. 
CONGRESS MOVING TPA GOALPOSTS 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William A. Eaton - Reasons 1.5(b and d) 
 
¶1.  (C) It would be "unfair and unwise" for the U.S. Congress 
to "move the goalposts" before acting on the U.S.-Panama 
Trade Promotion Agreement (TPA), President Martin Torrijos 
told Ambassador on July 9.  He was unhappy with recent 
statements from the U.S. Congress indicating that Panama and 
Peru had to pass all implementing legislation before the U.S. 
Congress would vote on the TPA.  He recounted Panama's "good 
faith" efforts so far to legislate and implement necessary 
changes (such as creating a new, science-based Food Safety 
Authority to better manage sanitary & phytosanitary issues) 
even before signature of the TPA.  Torrijos said the GOP 
would do the same if other legislation was required. 
 
¶2.  (C) Torrijos feared that the U.S. Congress' possible 
imposition of new pre-conditions for its action on the TPA 
could stir up nationalistic fervor in Panama that would be 
unhelpful for the TPA.  He planned to visit New York City 
later in July, where he hoped to meet with House Ways and 
Means Chairman Charles Rangel to prevent any "unpleasantness" 
during Rangel's August trip to Panama.
