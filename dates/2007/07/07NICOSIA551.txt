REF: STATE 89911 
 
Poloff June 29 delivered reftel points to MFA Americas Desk 
Officer Nikos Panayi.  Noting that Cyprus also firmly 
believes open and free access to information on the Internet 
is "very important" to any modern society, Panayi assured 
Poloff that Cyprus understands that problems with Internet 
access in Cuba are a result of Cuban government restrictions 
and not U.S. sanctions.  He said Cyprus hopes Internet access 
restrictions in Cuba can be lifted, but that the "ball is in 
Cuba's court" for any such actions.  Panayi stated Cyprus 
would be open to raising U.S. requests for achieving Internet 
freedom in Cuba within the framework of a potential EU-Cuban 
dialogue.
