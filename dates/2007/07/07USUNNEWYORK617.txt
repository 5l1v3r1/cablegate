FOR THE SECRETARY FROM AMBASSADOR KHALILZAD 
 
E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PGOV UNSC FR
SUBJECT: FRANCE PROPOSES SECURITY COUNCIL SUMMIT FOR 
SEPTEMBER 
 
 
(SBU) French Permrep Jean-Marc de La Sabliere told Amb Khalilzad 
on July 25 that France is interested in having a Security 
Council summit on Darfur at the head of state level during 
the General Debate of the UN General Assembly in September. 
De La Sabliere stated that he is 90 percent certain that 
President Sarkozy will support this proposal.  Qatar's 
Permrep also told Amb Khalilzad separately that the Emir 
would likely attend.  France clearly wants to use its 
Security Council Presidency in September to focus on Darfur. 
France may seek to present the proposed summit as a meeting 
on issues in Africa, rather than highlight their intended 
focus on Darfur.
