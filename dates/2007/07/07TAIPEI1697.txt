Standard Chartered Raises Taiwan's GDP Growth 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. Standard Chartered (Taiwan) raised its 2007 real GDP growth 
forecast for Taiwan from 4.1% to 4.5%, attributing the rise mainly 
to accelerated private consumption growth.  Expansion of private 
consumption, stimulated partly by a rise in stock prices and partly 
by resolution of credit/cash card debt problems, also prompted the 
Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER) to increase Taiwan's 
estimated growth to 4.21% from April's 4.09% projection.  Goldman 
Sachs is more optimistic than other forecasters, projecting the 
growth rate will further rise from 4.5% in 2007 to 5.5% in 2008. 
All of these groups anticipate that increases in the prices of 
imported grain and crude oil will drive up inflation from below one 
percent in the first half (H1) of this year to over two percent in 
H2, with TIER's forecast rate reaching a 13-year quarterly high of 
3.8% in the last quarter (Q4) of this year. 
 
Improved Economic Performance, Inflationary Threat 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶3.  All economic indicators in H1 showed improvement in Taiwan's 
economic performance.  Growth in export orders accelerated to a 
double-digit rate in H1 from a single-digit level in Q4 of last 
year.  Imports of capital goods in the second quarter (Q2) shifted 
to growth, signaling an increase in domestic investment.  Approved 
foreign direct investment in Q2 also shifted to growth, while 
manufacturing production reported accelerated growth.  Prices 
remained stable in H1, but increases in imported grain and crude oil 
prices will become an inflationary threat.  In response, the Central 
Bank of China (Taiwan) (CBT) raised its benchmark rates and 
increased required reserves for some deposits in June.  The CBT has 
also increased its open market operations in an attempt to sop up 
excess liquidity. 
 
Penalty on UMC for Investment in China Overruled 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶4. The Taiwan Administrative High Court (TAHC) overruled a fine of 
NT$5 million (US$151,510) imposed by the Ministry of Economic 
Affairs (MOEA) on United Microelectronics Company (UMC) for its 
unregistered investment in He Jian Technology in China.  The TAHC 
said that the MOEA did not have sufficient evidence for UMC's 2001 
investment in He Jian.  The MOEA will appeal. 
 
Medical Tourism 
--------------- 
 
¶5. Taiwan announced it will allow entry of mainland Chinese for 
medical treatment, beginning August 1, 2007.  Treatment may be in 
any of the medical specialties in which Taiwan offers world-class 
care: liver transplants, facial surgery, heart surgery, artificial 
insemination and joint replacement surgery.  The newly-approved 
 
TAIPEI 00001697  002 OF 003 
 
 
measures would both circumvent the apparently stalled tourism talks 
with China and be a money-maker for Taiwan's medical industry. 
Estimates are the ambitious plan could attract as many as 100,000 
customers, generate NT$7 billion (US$212 million) in 3 years, and 
create 3,500 jobs in Taiwan. 
 
Fubon Intends to Acquire PRC Bank 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  Taiwan's Fubon Financial Holdings (FFH), the third-largest 
financial holding Company in Taiwan, intends to acquire 20% the 
PRC's Xiamen City Commercial Bank (XCCB) through its Hong Kong 
subsidiary Fubon Bank (Hong Kong).  FFH will cooperate with its 
strategic partners to control 51% ownership and ultimately 
participate in the operation of XCCB.  Senior FFH executives have 
discussed the project with Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission 
(FSC) although Fubon has not yet submitted a formal application for 
regulatory approval, however. 
 
Taiwan Ranks Sixth in World IT competitiveness 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶7.  The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) recently gave Taiwan a 
world ranking of sixth in terms of information technology (IT) 
competitiveness, behind the United States, Japan, South Korea, the 
United Kingdom and Australia.  Taiwan's ranking was ahead of Hong 
Kong's 21st and China's 64th among the 64 rated economies.  The 
rating was the first of its kind issued by the EIU.  In an interview 
with Taiwan's Central News Agency, EIU Chief Researcher Macquarie 
said that Taiwan's strengths are in hardware, semiconductors, and 
personal computers, all of which are at a world-class standard.  He 
noted that Taiwan still has room for further development in the 
areas of software and technology services, however. 
 
Taiwan DRAM Manufacturers Top World Market 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶8.  In 2006, Taiwan DRAM (dynamic random access memory) 
manufacturers took a 37% global market share, and are expected to 
increase their share in 2007.  DRAMeXchange, a market intelligence 
group, reports that Taiwan companies comprise nine of the top 20 
memory manufacturers in the world.  On average, one of every three 
computers worldwide uses DRAMs made by Taiwan companies.  A-Data 
Technology, which ranks at the top of Taiwan's DRAM industry, is the 
second-largest memory module vendor in the world.  Transcend, number 
four in the world and specializing in flash memory, is projected to 
replace A-Data as Taiwan's largest memory vendor, as the flash 
memory market is likely to overtake the DRAM market.  Acer ranks 
sixth in the world, and its own brand Apacer has seen strong sales 
for server memory. 
 
Bayer Acquires Taiwan Resins and Films Producer 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶9.  Bayer, a German pharmaceuticals company, recently completed its 
acquisition of Ure-Tech Group, the Asia-Pacific region's largest 
producer of thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU).  This acquisition, 
Bayer's first investment in Taiwan over the past ten years, will 
make Bayer the world's largest supplier of TPU resins and films. 
With the addition of Ure-Tech's facilities, Bayer Material Science 
will have a total of eight TPU resin and film plants, with one each 
in Taiwan, China, India, and Japan.  The remaining four are in the 
United States and Germany. 
 
Double Taxation in EPZs Removed 
------------------------------------- 
 
 
TAIPEI 00001697  003 OF 003 
 
 
¶10.  In July, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) revised its regulations 
to eliminate double taxation on companies moving goods between two 
Taiwan locations, i.e., into and out of Export Processing Zones 
(EPZs).  The revised regulations exempt customs duties for 
"non-bonded goods" moving from EPZs to tax zones.  Non-bonded goods 
entering tax zones will only be subject to a 5% business transaction 
tax.  The revised regulations will also apply to bonded factories 
and manufacturing firms located in science industrial parks.  The 
double taxation issue arose in April when Taiwan relaxed 
restrictions to allow manufacturing firms in the tax-free EPZs to 
produce non-bonded goods which were, therefore, subject to customs 
duties twice, i.e., on both entering and leaving EPZs. 
 
Science Park to Allow Industry Services 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶11.  The Executive Yuan has submitted planned amendments to the 
"Management Statute for the Establishment of Science Parks" to the 
Legislative Yuan (LY) for review.  The bill is designed to build a 
comprehensive business community within science industrial parks 
where industry services can be offered and unused factories can be 
rebuilt through title transfers, without resorting to forced sales. 
(Note:  Land in science industrial parks is owned by the government. 
 End Note.)  The bill would allow companies serving industries to 
enter science industrial parks, including R&D organizations, 
incubation centers, banks, guesthouses, and conference centers. 
Land occupied by these service firms is subject to a ceiling of 5% 
of the park's total area.   The legislation will encourage transfer 
of unused rent-free factories for a maximum of six months so the 
buyer can engage in construction, renovation and/or installation of 
new equipment.
