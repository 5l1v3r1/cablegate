¶1. (SBU) Summary:  On June 21, President Ortega officially opened 
the Venezuelan Bank for Economic and Social Development (BANDES) in 
Nicaragua.  He personally handed out USD 9.65 million in loans to 
six cooperatives for small agricultural projects and USD 10 million 
in grants to five parastatals.  The Venezuelan President of BANDES 
presented the money as "proof" of Venezuela's continued assistance 
to Nicaragua.  BANDES' current operation raises questions about its 
viability as a bank, however.  The capital reserves are below 
Nicaragua's mandated limits; the cooperatives receiving the money 
are, for the most part, not experienced micro-lenders; and the 
lending rate of 5% is far below the market rate.  Currently, BANDES 
looks less like a bank and more like a development agency handing 
out project grants.  It could well become Ortega's chosen instrument 
to funnel Venezuelan assistance to the FSLN away from the prying 
eyes of the National Assembly and donors.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) On June 21, President Ortega officially opened the Venezuelan 
Bank for Economic and Social Development (BANDES) in Nicaragua, as 
part of the cooperation between Nicaragua and Venezuela under ALBA. 
The bank, a representative office of BANDES Venezuela, opened its 
doors for operation with USD 20 million in capital, which it 
promptly disbursed.  Also in attendance at the inauguration were 
First Lady Rosario Murillo, Venezuelan Agricultural Minister Elias 
Jaua, the President and Vice President of BANDES, and several 
Nicaraguan cabinet members. 
 
Money to Burn 
------------- 

¶3. (U) During the opening ceremonies, President Ortega personally 
handed out checks totaling USD 9.65 million to six cooperatives for 
small agricultural projects.  The dollar-denominated loans carry 5% 
interest with a two year grace period (the length of these loans was 
not disclosed.)  The cooperatives are to make the money available to 
almost 11,000 small agricultural producers. 
 
¶4. (U) President Ortega also handed out USD 10 million in grants to 
five parastatals: 
 
-- USD 3.3 million to the national water company (ENACAL) for 
maintenance of its equipment, networks and water treatment plants 
 
-- USD 3.2 million to the national electric company (ENEL) to build 
hydroelectric plants 
 
-- USD 2.9 million for to the Ministry of Health to improve medical 
services 
 
-- USD 350,000 to the National Police to prevent crime 
 
-- USD 308,000 to the National Postal System to buy supplies. 
 
Support for the National Police came in the form of cash as well as 
32 motorcycles and 18 patrol cars, all with "BANDES...the ALBA Bank" 
painted on the doors. 
 
From Venezuela With Love 
------------------------ 

¶5. (U) The event was an opportunity for Venezuelan officials to make 
a big splash about Venezuelan assistance.  Venezuelan Minister of 
Agriculture Elias Jaua stated that "Nicaragua does not owe Venezuela 
anything, since Venezuela already forgave the USD 32 million of 
bilateral debt."  Jaua also promised more power generators to 
produce 60 MW or more, a housing development and school development 
plan, improvements to the water system, five tons of basic 
medicines, 150 tractors, 400,000 school backpacks, 50,000 teacher 
briefcases, and almost 31 tons of urea (fertilizer); in addition to 
the shipments of diesel, gasoline, and cooking gas.  The President 
of BANDES said that Venezuela will continue supporting Nicaragua, as 
promised by President Chavez, emphasizing that the purpose of this 
support was to "heal the social debt that was brought by the 
neo-liberal wave that crushed the entire continent." 
 
The Cooperatives 
---------------- 

¶6. (SBU) The reason why the benefiting cooperatives will receive the 
money directly is that traditional micro-finance institutions would 
not agree to re-lend the money at 5%, according to one cooperative 
director.  At least three of the six cooperatives have strong ties 
to the FSLN.  Only two, CARUNA and SIFINA, already focus on 
micro-lending.  Another, Nicaraocoop, only produced organic honey 
before being tapped by President Ortega to handle all of the urea 
(fertilizer) imports from Venezuela.  According to the President of 
the National Association of Micro-Finance Institutions, micro-loans 
at 5% require a subsidy, as interest does not even cover 
administrative costs.  Some cooperatives, like CARUNA, will pass the 
administrative costs on to the borrower, resulting in real interest 
rates of 8 to 9.5%.  Others, like SIFINA and Nicaraocoop, will 
absorb the administrative costs and lend the money at 2% to its 
member cooperatives, which will then lend the money at 5%.  (Note: 
Current long-term dollar denominated loan rates for agriculture are 
11.9%.  Micro-finance institutions rates range between 20-40%. End 
note.) 
 
Comment - But Is It Really a Bank? 
---------------------------------- 

¶7. (SBU) Though registered as a representative office (loans only, 
no deposits) by the Superintendent of Banks (SIBIOF), BANDES is 
behaving more like a development agency than the second floor bank 
it has purported to be, at least for this first round of 
disbursements.  It quickly disbursed half of its capital and has not 
properly capitalized these loans. (Note: SIBIOF requires a 10% 
reserve against loans - only USD 350,000 remains in BANDES' coffers. 
End Note.)  Even as a development agency, its procedures do not 
guarantee effectiveness.  The loans, at 5% (or even 9.5%), are below 
market rates, creating opportunities for rent-seekers, who would not 
necessarily be the small producers BANDES purports to help.  BANDES 
could well become Ortega's chosen instrument to funnel Venezuelan 
funds directly to FSLN supporters.  As a private banking 
institution, BANDES and its funds can be kept away from the national 
budget, its earmarks, and congressional and donor scrutiny.  End 
Comment.
