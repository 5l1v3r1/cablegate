In Today's Papers 
 
All Eyes on Opposition CHP 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Cumhuriyet, Radikal, Bugun, Vatan, Yeni Safak: 
Papers report that all eyes turned to CHP leader Deniz Baykal for 
his response to the results of the election.  Mainstream Hurriyet 
reports that Baykal, in his initial assessment of elections to his 
close friends said that the party organization did its best in the 
election campaign.  Baykal said "the popularity of CHP and 
nationalist MHP increased but the center right collapsed" and those 
votes went to AKP.  Discussing the election results with his 
advisors, Baykal indicated that he would not resign.  Hurriyet adds 
that the biggest support to Baykal came from former President 
Demirel.  Reportedly, Demirel called Baykal and advised him not to 
resign.  Speaking to Hurriyet, Demirel said that Baykal is a 
well-educated politician and he fulfilled his duties completely. 
Meanwhile, opposing groups in CHP are urging Baykal to resign, 
papers report. 
 
In the early afternoon, on live TV, Baykal said he would not step 
down from his party's leadership, saying "things will be different 
in the next election." 
 
The New Cabinet 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Vatan and others:  Papers report that PM 
Erdogan plans an extensive cabinet re-shuffle.  Milliyet reports 
that there is a belief that new names Ertugrul Gunay (possible 
Deputy PM), Zafer Caglayan (possible Industry Minister), Mehmet 
Simsek (possible Economy Minister) and Mehmet Saglam (possible 
Education Minister) will have ministerial positions.  Deputy PM 
Mehmet Ali Sahin, Agriculture Minister Mehdi Eker, Public Works 
Minister Faruk Ozak and Forestry Minister Osman Pepe are expected to 
lose their posts.  According to AKP circles, before the cabinet, the 
first important hurdle in front of PM Erdogan will be the election 
of the Parliament Speaker.  It is not clear whether or not the 
current speaker Bulent Arinc would run for the position of Speaker 
again. 
 
Commentators began urging the AKP to think of foreign policy 
matters.  Sami Kohen writes in the mainstream daily Milliyet: "The 
power of the AKP to form a solo government paves the way for the 
continuation of policy and ensures stability.  As some EU officials 
have already pointed out, the EU should be facilitative and helpful 
toward the AKP government in the integration process.  Another issue 
the new government will have to deal with is Northern Iraq.  The 
possibility of a cross-border operation has been a hot topic but the 
discussion was interrupted by election campaigning.  This issue will 
certainly be on the parliament and government's agenda.  The 
necessary diplomatic and political contacts on this issue, 
interrupted by the elections, are expected to speed up.  For 
instance, the Iraqi Prime Minister is going to visit Ankara soon. 
On the other hand, Turkey strongly hopes to see some concrete steps 
taken in Northern Iraq against the PKK.  That said, Ankara should be 
able to see some signs of these steps both from the US and Iraq." 
 
Kubilay Celik writes in the nationalist daily Tercuman: "The AKP 
should immediately take up the following urgent pending foreign 
policy issues: the terrorist organization PKK in the north of Iraq, 
the EU process, Cyprus, gas deal with Iran and both the US and 
Russian efforts to prevent it.  The EU and the US feel relieved with 
the solo AKP government, as both worked with them closely during the 
last five years.  Yet the AKP government will also put pressure on 
the EU because of the steps that they will have to take to continue 
the negotiation process.  As for the US, the PKK issue is the most 
urgent one to resolve.  The US knows Turkey's sensitivity on this 
and must take action regarding the PKK as soon as possible." 
 
Presidential Election Process 
All papers report that the critical process of the Presidential 
 
ANKARA 00001888  002 OF 002 
 
 
election has started again.  Since the AKP does not have enough 
seats in Parliament to elect the President, signals of compromise 
started coming from AKP.  Milliyet says, despite the messages from 
Erdogan of compromise, opposition parties display a cautious 
attitude and they want to see the candidates considered by AKP for 
the Presidency.  Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet and mainstream 
Milliyet say that Erdogan will bring out a candidate who would be 
accepted by both CHP and MHP.  However, Foreign Minister Abdullah 
Gul's stance will play a determining role in Erdogan's approach.  If 
Gul insists on running, Erdogan may not seek compromise with the 
opposition. 
 
PKK Leader Expects Cross-border Operation, US General Says "No Need 
for Alarm" 
Hurriyet, Zaman:  Islamist-oriented Zaman reports that PKK leader in 
Northern Iraq Murat Karayilan said in an interview with AP that the 
PKK is expecting a Turkish cross-border operation just after the 
election and that the organization is prepared for it.  Hurriyet 
reports that US General Benjamin Mixon in Northern Iraq, at an 
interview with the AP, said that "the US is planning to withdraw its 
troops from Iraq soon and starting from August the control will be 
fully transferred to Iraqi authorities."  When General Mixon was 
asked about a possible Turkish cross-border operation, he said "I am 
not alarmed on that issue.  I believe that the issue will be 
resolved in the long run."
