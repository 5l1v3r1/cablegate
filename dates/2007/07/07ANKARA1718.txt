REF: STATE 78898 
 
¶1. As per reftel request, we spoke with Aselsan (Full name 
Aselsan Electronics Industries Inc.) Purchasing Manager 
Mehmet Ali Akcoray on June 22 regarding license number 
05-1008088.  Akcoray relayed our questions to Aselsan's 
technical section, which confirmed the receipt of 255 UAV 
rings and all details of the contract. 
 
¶2. Aselsan received the 255 UAV rings (P/N 951735-0001, Alcoa 
P/N CA2210-M6R) on November 25, 2006, and is currently 
storing them in its warehouse facilities.  Aselsan confirmed 
that it has purchased the UAV rings for use in the Heron UAV 
(Heron Medium Altitude long endurance Unmanned Aerial 
Vehicle), as a component of its GPS embedded ring laser Gyro 
Inertial Navigation System (LM-100G). 
 
¶3. The range of the Heron UAV is 200 kilometers when not 
interrupted.  The UAV's payload consists of a thermal camera 
system (Aselflir 300T), an LN100 INS/GPS system, and, for 
some UAVs, a SAR radar system. 
 
¶4. Based on our conversations with Aselsan employees, who 
fully answered all of our questions, we believe that the 
items will be used for the purposes stated in the license.
