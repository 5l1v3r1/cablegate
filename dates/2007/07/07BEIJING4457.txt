¶1. Key points at the July 3 MFA Press Conference were: 
 
-- The MFA said FM Yang would meet with DPRK leader Kim Jong 
Il this afternoon. 
 
-- China holds an open attitude toward the restarting of the 
Six-Party Talks and all parties should jointly set a date for 
the resumption of talks. 
 
-- The spokesman referred reporters to previous statements 
when asked for comment on the Pope's letter to Chinese 
Catholics released this weekend.

visit China July 9-14 as will Syria Deputy PM al-Dardari July

FM Yang to Meet Kim Jong Il, Six-Party Talks 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. At the July 3 regular MFA press briefing, spokesman Qin 
Gang said that FM Yang would meet with DPRK leader Kim 
Jong-il this afternoon to convey China's will to solve the 
Korean nuclear issue peacefully and to discuss the 
implementation of the initial actions and the long-term 
stability of Northeast Asia.  Yang has met with FM Pak 
Ui-chun and PM Kim Yong Il to discuss the strengthening of 
the bilateral relationship, including in the areas of 
agriculture and science and technology.  They also discussed 
economic bilateral cooperation. 
 
¶3. China holds an open attitude on the restarting of the 
Six-Party Talks, stated Qin in response to a question, adding 
that a date for the resumption of Talks should be jointly set 
by all parties. 
 
No Further Comment on Pope's Letter, Cardinal Zen 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶4. The spokesman referred reporters to previous statements on 
China-Vatican relations when asked for comment on the Pope's 
letter to Chinese Catholics released this weekend.  Asked for 
the MFA's reaction to the Chinese Catholic Patriotic 
Association head's criticism of Hong Kong's Cardinal Zen for 
participating in demonstrations over the weekend, Qin said 
the issue falls outside of his area of responsibility. 
 
Dalai Lama Should Be Informed to Make Right Policy 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶5. Lodi Gyari makes frequent trips to China and is not 
traveling as the Dalai Lama's "Special Envoy," Qin said 
commenting on the visit.  China's consistent policy is that 
it sincerely cares for the spiritual needs of Tibetans and 
hopes Tibetans abroad will cherish every opportunity to visit 
China and convey to the Dalai Lama the real situation so that 
he can make the right policy, Qin added. 
 
Climate Change: Developed Nations Should Give Support 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶6. The MFA has taken note of Ban Ki-moon's comments, replied 
Qin when asked about the UN Secretary General's remarks that 
China should do more to fight climate change.  Qin emphasized 
that developed countries should do more to shoulder the 
responsibility of climate change, for example, by providing 
technical support to developing countries.  Asked about news 
that research evidencing pollution's harm to civilians in 
China was left out of a World Bank report, the spokesman said 
he had noticed the reports. 
 
Food Export Safety: Rationalism, Not Media Hype 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶7. China attaches great importance to the safety of food 
exports and Chinese imports should enjoy the reputation of 
high quality at a good price, said Qin when asked why Chinese 
products were at the center of controversy.  Unscrupulous 
 
BEIJING 00004457  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
traders, differing systems and specific cases not indicative 
of exports as a whole have fed recent media hype and 
politicization creating consumer panic, said Qin.  China 
understands the concern but hopes the media will adopt a 
constrained and rational view to ensure safe and reliable 
products for international consumers, he added. 
 
Visits: FM Yang to Russia, Wu Yi to Singapore 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶8. FM Yang will visit Russia July 12-15 and Vice PM Wu Yi 
will visit Singapore July 9-12 to co-chair the 9th 
China-Singapore Joint Steering Council meeting and the 4th 
China-Singapore bilateral cooperation joint-committee 
meeting.  At the invitation of PM Wen, Mauritius PM Ramgoolam 
will visit China July 9-14.  Syria Deputy PM al-Dardari will 
visit July 8-11, as will Malaysia FM Albar July 9-13. 
 
Conflict in Ecuador, Japan and History 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶9. The MFA said a conflict at oil facilities of a Chinese 
company in Ecuador has been stabilized with no Chinese 
injuries and gave no information on a potential visit by 
Ecuador President Correa.  Asked about activities 
commemorating the Anti-Japanese War, Qin reiterated China's 
stance that Japan should take history as a mirror and 
properly handle historical issues.
