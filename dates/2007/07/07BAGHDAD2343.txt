SUBJECT: PRT TIKRIT: COULD A LIST-BASED ELECTION THREATEN 
ANOTHER SUNNI BOYCOTT IN SALAH AD DIN? 
 
 
¶1. (U) This is a PRT Tikrit, Salah ad Din cable. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Most residents in the province of Salah ad Din (SaD) 
want elections to happen as soon as possible.  They 
acknowledge that the boycott of the 2005 poll was a serious 
political misstep, and they are keen to correct it.  In 
addition to wanting better representatives elected to 
national positions, they would also like to correct the 
geographic imbalance at the Provincial Council, which has no 
or limited representation from some major cities, including 
Bayji and Samarra.  Would-be candidates and residents 
generally have weak ties to political parties, with most 
declaring themselves "independent."  The list-based system of 
the previous elections, which required voters to select 
political parties rather than individual candidates, is 
universally disliked. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Most in the province see the list-based electoral 
system as the reason that Iraqi politics have become so 
sectarian and that "deserters," Iraqis who left the country 
during the former regime, are now in positions of power. 
Several provincial government officials have said that how 
the elections are conducted is critical to seeing the 
province participate.  The Governor has even said he will 
ensure that the next elections see candidates selected, not 
political parties.

Comment 
------- 
¶4. (SBU) If the list-based electoral system remains intact, 
it is possible a number of Sunnis in Salah ad Din will 
boycott the elections again.  In the balance of the next 
elections, whenever they occur, hangs SaD Sunnis' perception 
that the GOI and provincial government are legitimate 
institutions and that Iraq's democracy allows for equal 
participation from individuals who held low-level or 
technocratic positions in the former regime.  Although many 
in the province, especially the tribal leadership, are taking 
steps to fight al Qaeda, much work still remains to bring SaD 
Sunnis fully into the political fold and to see democratic 
institution take hold popularly.
