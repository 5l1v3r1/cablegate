In Today's Papers 
 
FM Gul: "If the US Cannot, We Can Enter Iraq and Solve the Issue"; 
Ambassador Wilson Comments on PKK 
Radikal, Star, Turkiye, Sabah, Bugun and others:  Liberal Radikal 
reports that in an exclusive interview with the paper, FM Gul said 
that the "government's plans for a military incursion into Northern 
Iraq are ready down to every detail.  Unfortunately, cooperation 
with the US in the fight against the PKK is far below our 
expectations.  As the occupational force, the US is responsible for 
the terrorist attacks launched from Iraq to Turkey.  If Iraq or the 
US is unable to stop the PKK threat, we will make a decision and 
enter Iraq."  Gul added that there is consensus about the plans for 
a cross-border operation and the political decision makers are 
waiting for the right time to launch an operation. 
 
Meanwhile, papers report that during an official visit to Izmir 
Governor Cahit Kirac's office, US Ambassador to Turkey Ross Wilson 
said that "Iraq is Turkey's neighbor, therefore, security and 
stability should be established there."  Stressing that the US is 
shocked by the PKK attacks against Turkey and condemns these 
attacks, Ambassador Wilson added that "The US and Turkey coordinate 
in order to prevent these terrorist attacks.  Recently, we gave 
strong messages to Iraqi officials for the terrorist attacks to be 
stopped."  Mainstream Sabah reports that following the visit of 
Iraqi President Talabani to China, a written statement issued by the 
Chinese Foreign Ministry said that "China condemns all kinds of 
terrorist activities but, at the same time, respects the freedom, 
sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Iraq." 
 
Iraqi Spokesman: "Cross-Border Operation would Harm Bilateral 
Relations" 
In an interview with mainstream Sabah, Iraqi government spokesman 
Ali-Al-Dabbagh said that "Iraq itself is plagued by terror and is 
fighting against all terror organizations, including the PKK. 
Nevertheless, a cross-border operation would have serious 
consequences and would harm Turkey-Iraq relations." 
 
Support Increases in the US Congress for the Armenian Resolution 
Liberal Radikal reports the US-Armenia National Committee (ANCA) 
announced that the number of Representatives in the US Congress who 
support the Armenian resolution has reached 209.  The House of 
Representatives has 435 members and if the number of supporters 
reaches 218, then the chances for Nancy Pelosi to carry the 
resolution to the floor of the House will increase.  In order to 
reach these numbers, ANCA members began a telephone campaign to get 
support from the members of the Congress. 
 
GENAR Survey 
Islamist oriented Yeni Safak reports about a survey conducted by 
polling company GENAR.  The results of survey are based on 
interviews with 2007 people in 18 cities and 49 towns, and predict 
that three parties will enter parliament: AKP with 40.9%, CHP 22.1%, 
and MHP 10.8%.  The survey also shows public preferences on the 
controversy surrounding a possible military incursion into Northern 
Iraq:  37.9 percent of the voters say Turkey should never launch a 
cross-border operation, 33.8 percent want an immediate operation and 
16.1 percent said an operation might be useful later. 
 
EDITORIAL OPINION:   US-Iraq; Middle East Quartet/Tony Blair 
 
"Deteriorating Image of the US" 
Kamuran Ozbir wrote in the nationalist Ortadogu (6/29): "The Middle 
East entered into a new phase following the US occupation of Iraq. 
The US, however, currently faces difficulty because it is unable to 
control the course.  Iraq is no longer a unified state, nor will it 
be from now on.  Moreover, Iraq has not emerged as a free market, as 
Western powers were hoping.  Iraq's future is now in complete shadow 
as are the consequences for the US.  Not only for Iraq, but for the 
entire Middle East region, it seems that instability and insecurity

will be even more prevalent than ever before.  All of these 
developments are shaking the persuasive power of the US and 
increasing the level of mistrust toward the US." 
 
"Can Blair Be Successful in His New Job?" 
Kubilay Celik wrote in the nationalist Tercuman (6/29): "Tony Blair 
has become the Envoy for the Middle East Quartet, which consists of 
the EU, the UN, the US and Russia.  Blair's main responsibility is 
to work to find ways to resolve peacefully the long-term and 
never-ending problems between Israel and Palestine.  The main 
problem vis-a-vis Blair's job is about whether or not to be 
impartial.  Even if he tries to be impartial between the two sides, 
he cannot save himself from being labeled as a 'pro-Israel' envoy 
due to the nature of the Middle East Quartet.  Thus, Blair has no 
chance for success in his new job.  Being a partner with the US in 
the Iraq war is another disadvantage for Tony Blair.  He will not be 
able to eliminate the overall negative image even if he makes some 
personal effort.  Given the depth of the problems in the Middle 
East, such efforts are like treating cancer with aspirin."
