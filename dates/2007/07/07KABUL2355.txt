PATROLS 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: PRT Chaghcharan conducted a patrol 
of Pasaband and Dolina Districts from July 4-7, 
meeting with district officials, police, and elders. 
Residents of both districts praised the work of the 
ANP.  Development issues were the main concern for 
residents who thanked the PRT for its work but wanted 
more attention from the GoA and the international 
community.  END SUMMARY 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
PASABAND - STABLE, BUT CONTINUED TB INFILTRATION 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Pasaband District Chief of Police (CoP), 
Haji Noorali, welcomed the PRT team on July 4.  Having 
assumed the post six weeks earlier, Noorali described 
a recent engagement near the village of Pirak where 
his ANP forces killed two TB and captured eight 
others.  He said villagers from the area alerted the 
ANP to the TB location so they could intercept the 
group, an estimated 40 fighters.  After two TB leaders 
- Abadallah and Mullah Kamal - were captured, the 
remaining fighters abandoned the area, leaving behind 
rifles, machineguns, and motorcycles.  The two 
prisoners disclosed the location of a weapons storage 
area near Khona village on the Helmand border where 
the ANP recovered 28 mines and multiple canisters of 
machinegun ammunition. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Noorali said he was working hard to gain the 
confidence of the local population, who welcome tough 
action against the TB.  He reported that villagers are 
providing accurate information about TB elements in 
Pasaband and even Helmand.  He identified small roads 
and foot paths where he and his staff believe the TB 
are crossing into Pasaband from Helmand.  Noorali 
expressed confidence that his force of 70 ANP can 
handle these incursions with this intelligence, but 
said additional equipment (at least two more heavy 
machine guns PKMs and at least two more Ford Ranger 
police vehicles, in addition to more AK ammunition 
magazinges) was needed to increase ANP capability and 
to halt the incursions. 
 
-------------- 
PASABAND SHURA 
-------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) PRToff and Patrol Commander conducted a 
Shura on July 5, with over 30 district elders.  Elders 
expressed support for Noorali personally and his 
aggressive actions against TB elements, downplayed the 
significance of the TB incursions, and welcomed more 
PRT and NGO activity in Pasaband.  They highlighted 
the activity and good relations of the NGO MADERA. 
(Note: MADERA is a French NGO that works in animal 
husbandry, irrigation, cash for work (roads), and 
school construction.  End Note.)  Elders expressed 
appreciation for PRT/NGO efforts to build two schools 
in the area but wanted assistance to improve the small 
district clinic and more trained teachers.  They said 
Pasaband residents supported the government but were 
disappointed that provincial authorities rarely 
visited the district.  They encouraged more PRT 
visits.  The patrol also traveled to Zamina Ghar and 
Sangan villages, where teachers and village leaders 
echoed the comments of the Shura elders. 
 
--------------- 
DOLINA DISTRICT 
--------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The PRT patrol met with district 
administrator Barajudin and CoP Sadadin who indicated 
the security situation is good.  No TB elements are 
active in Dolina, and the people support the GoA. 
Barajudin said small tribal disputes cause occasional 
problems but the district's ANP force had performed 
 
KABUL 00002355  002 OF 002 
 
 
well and these incidents do not threaten the stability 
of the district.  He noted that many residents were 
involved in road improvement projects, which has 
improved the district's economy and greatly reduced 
travel time to Chaghcharan.  Barajudin said the 
development support in Dolina was good and they were 
pleased that a school had been finished and a district 
center was nearing completion. 
 
------------ 
ANP TRAINING 
------------ 
 
¶6.  (SBU) In both Pasaband and Dolina the Police 
Mentoring Program (PMT) conducted live fire and other 
training with district ANP.  The PMT now uses a cadre 
of ANP trainers to instruct basic police tactics at 
the district facilities, thereby eliminating travel to 
Chaghcharan and ensuring training is tailored to the 
need of the district.  In Dolina, the CoP said his men 
lack weapons training, so this was the main focus.  In 
Pasaband, PMT provided requested training in vehicle 
stops, searches, and patrols.  PMT training is also an 
opportunity for the PRT to identify areas of 
improvement for district ANP.  (Note:  Often the PRT 
discovers supply discrepancies between police 
headquarters in Chaghcharan and district police 
stations. End Note.)  In both Dolina and Pasaband, ANP 
stations requested two vehicles and additional heavy 
weapons to expand their patrol efforts and basic 
materials (i.e. pots-pans-utensils-bedding) to improve 
the quality of life of the ANP staff.  The district 
CoPs worked with the PMT to develop lists of needed 
equipment so the PMT can work with the Ghor ANP Chief 
to address the shortages. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Officials, elders and residents of Pasaband 
and Dolina communicated that the security in their 
districts is stable and can support increased 
development.  ANP leadership and staff are confident 
that they can counter TB incursions and, from every 
indication, enjoy good support among the population. 
Increased development is the major concern in both 
districts.  The PRT's challenge is to get the new 
Governor and his representatives out to the districts 
to engage with the population.
