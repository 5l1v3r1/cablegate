¶1. (SBU) Following Embassy queries over the past two weeks as 
to the whereabouts of Nabil Soliman, State Security contacts 
informed us on July 3 that Soliman had been released from 
Torah Liman Prison.  Soliman was returned by the U.S. to 
Egypt in June 2002, subsequently convicted of membership in 
Islamic Jihad, and sentenced to five years in prison.  His 
prison term was reportedly due to end on June 12. 
 
¶2. (SBU) When poloff called Soliman's wife on July 3 to 
inquire about his whereabouts, a jubilant Soliman answered 
the phone.  He profusely thanked poloff for the Embassy's 
five years of prison visits, and noted that he was moved on 
June 13 from Torah Liman prison to State Security facilities, 
for two weeks of interrogation prior to his July 3 release.
