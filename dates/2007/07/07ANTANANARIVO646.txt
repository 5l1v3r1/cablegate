SUBJECT: MADAGASCAR'S TROOP CONTRIBUTIONS FOR THE HYBRID OPERATION 
IN DARFUR 
 
REF: STATE 089941 
 
¶1. (SBU) Charge and U.S. Defense Attache met with Madagascar's 
Minister of Defense Petera Behajaina July 2 to discuss Madagascar's 
current troop contributions to the African Union Mission in Sudan 
(AMIS) and potential contributions to the upcoming UN/AU Hybrid 
Operations in Darfur.  Behajaina affirmed that Madagascar intended 
to continue providing at least modest numbers to the international 
peacekeeping efforts in Darfur, but was unwilling to indicate 
whether the Government of Madagascar would be able or willing to 
significantly increase its participation. 
 
¶2. (U) Madagascar has 14 peacekeeping observers in Sudan at present 
and 19 who have recently returned from deployment with AMIS.  In 
addition, 46 personnel have been approved by President Ravalomanana 
for immediate deployment to Darfur.  Those 46 are apparently waiting 
only on logistics funding (plane tickets) from the AU.  In addition, 
42 personnel are prepared to participate once the President gives 
his approval to send them.  In total, then, 102 officers are planned 
for Madagascar's participation in AMIS. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Behajaina estimated that these same troops would be 
available for the UN/AU Hybrid Operation; however, when pressed to 
identify any possible increase in numbers, he was unwilling to 
commit - one way or the other - without approval from President 
Ravalomanana.  He did, however, seek more information to assist in 
their decision-making process.  First, would the troops that are 
committed need to be fluent in English, or would it be acceptable 
for fluent French speakers to participate, as this would greatly 
increase the number of potential candidates?  Second, given that the 
Malagasy military has a "bulge" of mid-level officers, would it be 
acceptable if most participants came from this cadre? 
 
¶4. (SBU) With respect to equipment and training, Behajaina sought 
further information on what kind of training would be available.  He 
indicated that Madagascar's troops would need to be completely 
outfitted for equipment to include communications, medical, 
personnel gear, and messing equipment/facilities.  Additionally, he 
requested a seminar hosted by a country that has experienced 
peacekeeping troops to explain the ground realities for peacekeeping 
in Darfur.  This could be a 2-3 day seminar to include operational 
and legal expectations and constraints. 
 
¶5. (SBU) COMMENT.  While Behajaina was unwilling to commit troops 
without higher authority approval, his questions were entirely 
pertinent to Madagascar's decision-making.  Post has agreed to stay 
in touch with the Ministry of Defense on these issues as more 
information becomes available, such as answers to the questions 
raised in Paragraph Three.  At a minimum, however, Madagascar has 
committed to sustaining its existing, modest presence.  END 
COMMENT.
