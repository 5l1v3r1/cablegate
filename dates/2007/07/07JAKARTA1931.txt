SecGen Ong Regrets Summit Postponement 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ambassador Hume paid a courtesy call on ASEAN Secretary 
General Ong Kong Yong on July 12 to discuss cooperation between 
ASEAN and the United States.  Ambassador Hume extended his sincere 
regret that the United States has had to explore an alternative date 
for the ASEAN-US Summit to commemorate the 30th Anniversary of the 
ASEAN-US Dialogue.  Ambassador Hume noted that the USG remains 
committed to enhancing our partnership with ASEAN.  Secretary 
General Ong expressed disappointment that ASEAN and the US would not 
be able to hold the Summit on September 5 in Singapore as planned. 
However, the Secretary General also expressed hope that all ten 
ASEAN member countries and the United States could find an 
alternative date, noting that a date in 2008 would be acceptable if 
it is still within 12 months of September 2007, the actual 30th 
Anniversary.  Ong also said that he has cautioned his staff and the 
ASEAN member countries not to let the postponement of the Summit 
undermine strong progress made in recent years on ASEAN-US 
cooperation. 
 
Indonesia Assumes Greater Leadership Role in ASEAN 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Secretary General Ong noted that Indonesia has assumed a 
stronger leadership role within ASEAN in recent years after a period 
of restrained engagement during the financial crisis and its 
aftermath.  In Ong's view, Indonesia's interest in moving ASEAN's 
agenda forward is an important aspect of ASEAN's ability to realize 
an ASEAN community by 2015.  Ong also noted that when Indonesia or 
other large countries become more assertive within ASEAN, the other 
countries resentment can manifest in the excessive use of 
bureaucratic process and slower decision-making. 
 
¶4. (U) Indonesia highlighted its commitment to transforming ASEAN 
into a unified community in a series of events on July 13-14 to 
commemorate ASEAN's 40th anniversary.  Embassy representatives 
attended the GOI-sponsored ASEAN Youth Ambassador Competition final 
on July 12 and the ASEAN Festival on July 13, both of which received 
wide local media coverage.  The Youth Ambassador Contest judges 
required the twenty extremely articulate finalists to answer tough 
questions on their vision of ASEAN and Indonesia's role within 
ASEAN.  The judges selected one female student, Kinanti 
Kusumawardani Taufik, 21, and one male student, Yoes Chandra 
Kenawas, 22, as the official ASEAN Youth Ambassadors, who will 
travel within Indonesia and ASEAN, as well as to Japan, to promote 
ASEAN among young people.  Some of Indonesia's foremost scholars and 
leaders, including Presidential Spokesman Dino Jalal, judged the 
event. 
 
Action Request 
-------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Post requests Department's assistance in identifying any 
ASEAN-US agreements, projects or other forms of cooperation that are 
close to completion that we can push along and use as symbols of our 
strong partnership with ASEAN.  Embassy believes we need to find 
ways to emphasize our commitment to ASEAN-US cooperation through 
concrete examples of our ongoing engagement as soon as possible.
