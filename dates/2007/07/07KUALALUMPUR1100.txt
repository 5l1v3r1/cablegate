¶1. (SBU) We delivered reftel demarche to the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs Principal Assistant Secretary for 
Multilateral Affairs, Bala Chandran.  Bala advised us that 
the MFA has sought clarification from their Mission in New 
York concerning the nature of the relationship between the 
African Union and the United Nations.  He acknowledged that 
Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi had commented to the press on 
June 25 that "If there is a request, Malaysia will send its 
troops," but explained that the United Nations had not yet 
approached Malaysia about troop contributions.  Bala 
mentioned that Malaysia was waiting to see what Sudan's 
"African neighbors" were going to do to contribute further. 
We encouraged the MFA to relay to the UN its willingness to 
contribute forces and to follow through with the PM's 
commitment to the region. 
 
¶2. (SBU) COMMENT: We believe Malaysia might respond 
positively if the United Nations makes a formal request for 
Malaysian support.  The opinions and concerns, positive or 
negative, of other OIC or Arab League members could also 
influence Malaysia's willingness to commit troops for the 
hybrid mission.
