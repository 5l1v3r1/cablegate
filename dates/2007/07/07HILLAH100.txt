¶1. (U) This is a PRT Karbala cable. 
 
¶2. (U) Again this week Sayed Ahmed al-Safi, Head of the Al Abbas 
shrine office, conducted the Friday sermon at Karbala's 
al-Husain shrine.  There is no official word about the absence 
of Sheikh Abdul Mehdi al-Karbalae at this time.  This sermon 
focused on the role of honest press reporting, government 
officials extending the "green zone" to other parts of Baghdad 
and public access to the government.  This was a quieter sermon 
than the last.  Local media coverage included Karbala Radio, and 
the following television channels; Karbala, Al-Iraqya, Al-Furat, 
and Al-Salam. 
 
¶3. (U) Al-Safi focused on security in and around Baghdad and the 
growing gap between government officials and the public they 
represent.  He called for government officials to move out of 
the "green zone" and to move back to the neighborhoods in 
Baghdad.  The security situation in Baghdad is not good, he 
highlighted, and that seven out of ten residents would echo that 
opinion.  Al-Safi encouraged the government officials, probably 
referring to the elected officials, to move out of the 
international zone and back to the neighborhoods of Baghdad.  He 
explained that the relocation would likely bring greater 
security to those neighborhoods.  He also urged the media to 
report the truth, accusing them of being disorganized and 
unclear about their facts and unreliable as sources of 
information for the people.  Lastly, al-Safi called for the 
government officials to get from behind their desks and the 
protection of their assistants to answer the hard questions 
directly and go into the field to see the people they represent. 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment:  This sermon called the government officials 
to task on being accessible to the voting public.  The portion 
about the media remains unclear; however it appears that al-Safi 
is calling on them to get their facts straight.  Chatter among 
the congregation focused on a recent military operation in 
Karbala City and a noticeable increase in Iraqi Army presence at 
check points within the city and patrolling the streets. 
Regarding the absent al-Karbalae , rumor on the street says that 
he may be in Iran for medical treatment or meetings. 
 
5.(SBU) Comment continued:  PRT Karbala with the support of 3ID 
expects to start posting an electronic version of the audio 
portion of the sermons on Tuesdays (or when available) for those 
interested in hearing the original sermon. As soon as that is 
available the PRT and 3ID will make the website available.(End
