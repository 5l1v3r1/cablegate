SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVED: REVEREND MOON'S REQUEST TO VISIT 
FRANCE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 87708 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Poloff on July 5 conveyed USG request that France 
consider lifting the Schengen ban on Unification Church 
leader Sun Myung Moon and his wife to Denis Fromaget, Deputy 
Councelor for Religious Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs.  Fromaget responded that he saw no immediate other 
reason than the Schengen ban -- now struck down -- for 
refusing Moon,s entry into France. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) However, because another office deals with Schengen 
Treaty issues, Fromaget said the Religious Affairs Office 
would need to confer before giving a final, official 
response.  He said he hoped to provide this response within 
15 days.
