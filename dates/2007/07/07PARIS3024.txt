SWING, WAITING ON EUROPEAN VIEWS 
 
REF: STATE 93920 
 
¶1. (SBU) MFA IO PDAS-Equivalent Marc Giacomini told poloff on 
July 10 that the MFA was open to the candidacy of Ambassador 
William Lacy Swing for Director-General of the International 
Organization for Migration (IOM).  The MFA concurred with the 
U.S. "in principle" that tenure in senior UN offices should 
not exceed a maximum of two terms.  Giacomini stopped short 
of a declaration of support for Swing's candidacy for IOM 
Director-General, cautioning that the MFA needed to consult 
first with European partners who might also be considering 
national candidacies.  In any event, France would not be 
putting forward a French national for the IOM position, he 
said. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In addition to incumbent IOM DG Brunson McKinley's 
current campaign for a third term, Giacomini advised that 
International Labor Office (ILO) DG Juan Solavia may also 
seek a third mandate.
