Classified By: Political Officer Janet E. Deutsch for reasons 1.4 (b) a 
nd (d). 
 
¶1.  (C) On July 9, the DCM called on Embassy of the Republic 
of Korea Counselors Nak-Young OH and Gon-Jong JANG regarding 
the five North Korean refugees seeking resettlement in the 
United States (reftel).  The DCM passed biographical 
information and fingerprints of the five individuals to the 
Koreans who agreed to transmit the information to the ROK 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Seoul for name checks.  The 
ROK will perform background security checks and determine 
whether the individuals have previously been resettled in 
South Korea as refugees. 
 
¶2. (C) Comment.  It appeared that the South Korean Embassy 
had not received instructions from the ROK MFA.  We suggest 
that U.S. Embassy Seoul communicate with relevant contacts in 
the ROK government to alert them that the refugees' 
biographical data and fingerprints are forthcoming from the 
ROK Embassy in Phnom Penh.  OH and JANG ambiguously took on 
the task of investigating the five North Koreans and Post is 
uncertain whether the ROK Embassy will definitively proceed. 
The Counselors were preoccupied with conveying their desire 
that the ROK pipeline for North Korean refugees not be 
publicly revealed and remain separate from any U.S. refugee 
processing pipeline for North Koreans.  The DCM stated that 
this is also the intention of the U.S.G.  End comment.
