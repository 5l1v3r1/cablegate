¶1. (U) Summary.  The Ambassador attended a July 2 media event with 
Minister of Health and Population Dr. Hatem El-Gabaly and seven MOHP 
employees who will attend USAID funded MBA programs in the U.S. 
El-Gabaly plans a U.S. visit in December.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) On July 2, the Ambassador attended a press event hosted by 
Minister of Health and Population Hatem El-Gabaly to promote $2 
million in USAID scholarships for seven MOHP employees to attend MBA 
programs in the U.S.  Another nine MOHP employees will go next year. 
 This MBA scholarship program is in response to El-Gabaly's request 
to develop a cadre of business-minded professionals within the MOHP 
to implement new paradigms in health care delivery.  El-Gabaly wants 
to send up to 500 MOHP employees on similar programs. 
 
¶3. (U) With media present, El-Gabaly praised the USG-funded MBA 
scholarships as a "really big thing for us" due to the "enormous 
difference in thinking and leadership" that will result at MOHP. 
El-Gabaly then praised the nearly USD 1 billion in USG aid over the 
years for health programs that reached "the poorest of the poor and 
changed their lives by improving their health."  The Ambassador 
remarked on USG and GOE partnership based on friendship and a mutual 
interest in prosperity that often begins with good health.  The 
Minister and Ambassador took photos with the MBA students for the 
assembled press.  State-owned dailies, Al-Gomhouriya and Al-Akhbar, 
ran front-page articles on July 3 with photos of the Minister and 
Ambassador with the students. The report also ran on television.

Minister to visit U.S. - Requests High Level Meetings

¶4. (U) After the press conference, Econoff met an advisor to the 
Minister, Dr. Mokhtar Warida, who sought Embassy's help to plan 
meetings for the Minister's December 3-6 visit to the U.S.  He 
requested meetings with high-level contacts across the USG and asked 
for suggestions for a private sector event.  Post will send details 
of the visit and meeting requests closer to the date. 
 
¶5. (SBU) COMMENT:  This was the second positive press event in two 
days orchestrated by El-Gabaly.  A leader in the "second generation" 
of reformers, El-Gahaly is charged with improving health services 
and reducing corruption in his massive bureaucracy.  His appointment 
last year reflected the Mubarak regime's acknowledgement that 
reforms should extend to service ministries.  The MBA initiative is 
all one El-Gahaly's signature programs, aimed at introducing great 
management and transparency to health services.  Unlike other GOE 
ministers El-Gahaly is embracing USG support and flagging it 
publicly.  He has had no difficulty generating positive press for 
his partnership initiatives.
