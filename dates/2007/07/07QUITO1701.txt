¶1.  (SBU) Post welcomes OPIC interest in supporting the important 
microcredit and small-medium enterprise market in Ecuador (ref A). 
We had delayed responding given recent uncertainty regarding the 
outcome of Ecuador's controversial banking bill, but can now provide 
a fulsome response as the law has been passed by Congress. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Banco ProCredito (BPC), the successor of Sociedad 
Financiera Ecuatorial S.A., was established in October 2001 by 
ProCredit Holding AG (formerly IMI) in Germany and the Dutch lottery 
fund DOEN. In September 2004, BPC received approval from the 
Superintendency of Banks to be transformed into a bank and converted 
into a fully operational bank in January 2005. BPC is headquartered 
in Quito, with 15 branch offices in 9 cities in the north and west 
of Ecuador.  BPC has grown very quickly since its inception in 
October 2001 and has consolidated its position as one of the leaders 
in Ecuador's microfinance market.  As of December 2006, BPC had 
$130.8 million in assets; a $47.4 million increase over the previous 
year. The loan portfolio grew by nearly $40 million and 
approximately 10,000 accounts from the previous year, resulting in 
an outstanding loan volume of US$117.5 million distributed among 
more than 40,400 micro and small entrepreneurs and rural producers. 
BPC received $8.6 million in paid-in capital and generated US $2 
million in profits - an increase of $1 million from 2005. BPC can 
now accept a range of deposits from the public which will fuel 
future expansion and development of new savings and loan products. 
Deposits more than doubled from 2005 to 2006 (from $20 million to 
$44.6 million) as did the number of accounts (from 15,500 to 
43,000). 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The banking law that was passed by Congress (ref B) 
entered into effect on July 26, 2007.  Initially, the 
administration's bill proposed strong political controls over the 
banking sector, but Congress substantially modified the bill to 
establish more limited controls, which the banking sector found 
relatively acceptable.  The legislation prohibits commissions, sets 
interest rate ceilings by market segment (commerce, consumption, 
housing and microcredit) and gives the Central Bank the authority to 
establish the methodology to calculate the effective rate of 
interest.  Banks claim that the law's maximum interest rate formula 
will tend to move interest rates towards a fixed rate within six to 
eight months.  President Correa is not satisfied with the new law 
because it does not provide for a low enough interest rate ceiling, 
and has vowed to seek stronger control of the financial sector 
through the Constituent Assembly later this year. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Comment:  OPIC is considering a project with an efficient 
and leading institution servicing micro and small businesses as well 
as rural producers.  Under a stable environment for the banking 
sector, the project would have a positive impact in underserved 
sectors of the economy.  While the project seems positive, the 
potential for changes in the Constituent Assembly to the legal 
framework for the banking sector, possibly including greater 
government control and lower mandatory fixed interest rates, could 
further disrupt the financial sector, particularly for microcredit. 
End Comment.
