¶1.  Econoff delivered on July 10 reftel points regarding the 
Cuban government's role in the poor state of Cuban internet 
access to Wim Rullens of the Coordination, Strategy, and 
International Affairs Directorate, Directorate General for 
Energy and Telecom, Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs. 
 
¶2.  In a subsequent discussion July 18, Rullens agreed that 
Cuban government controls and "poor handling" of internet 
freedom, not USG sanctions, were behind the poor state of 
internet access in Cuba.  Rullens asked whether the USG 
tracked Cuban internet users visiting USINT Havana. He added 
that the issue of internet freedom and our activities in Cuba 
could be discussed at the second Internet Governance Forum to 
occur in Rio de Janeiro November 12-15. 
 
¶3.  Rullens said he would share the information provided with 
counterparts at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
investigate whether the Dutch Embassy provided internet 
access to Cubans.  Post will follow up and report on any 
substantive information received or actions taken.
