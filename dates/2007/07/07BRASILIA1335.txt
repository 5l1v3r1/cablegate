SUBJECT:  BRAZIL: U.S. Treasury Secretary Paulson Meeting with 
Planning Minister Bernardo 
 
¶1. (SBU) In a July 11 meeting with Planning Minister Paulo Bernardo, 
U .S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson outlined the focus of his 
visit to Brazil: (1) increasing private sector infrastructure 
finance; (2) facilitating the development of small and medium-sized 
enterprise development through increased access to capital and a 
reduction in business barriers; (3) increasing the production and 
usage of biofuels; and, (4) increasing commercial interchange 
between the U.S. and Brazil through channels such as the CEO forum. 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Secretary Paulson indicated his interest in promoting 
bilateral cooperation and in defining a bilateral agenda that will 
lead to specific, tangible results.  He noted that Treasury recently 
announced initiatives in infrastructure finance (in conjunction with 
the IFC and IDB) and small and medium-sized enterprise development 
in Latin America (in conjunction with OPIC).  He also stated that he 
hopes to expand Treasury technical assistance with Brazil and the 
region in these areas and that he is interested in increasing 
staff-level interaction between U.S. Treasury and Brazil's Planning 
and Finance Ministries. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Minister Bernardo discussed the progress as well as the 
continued economic challenges that Brazil faces.  He noted the 
country's substantial macroeconomic progress in recent years (higher 
growth, improved fiscal performance, lower and more stable rates of 
inflation), rising personal disposable income levels, and the 
favorable impact of rating agency upgrades of Brazil to investment 
grade status, which will serve as an important catalyst for further 
private investment. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Minister Bernardo highlighted increased spending on 
infrastructure as Brazil's major economic challenge.  He noted that 
the positive role played by IFIs (World Bank and IDB) in improving 
the country's infrastructure, but felt they should further increase 
their involvement.  Specifically, he recommended that the World Bank 
augment its use of guarantees to help leverage more private 
investment. Minister Bernardo gave one specific example where he 
believes increased infrastructure investment will benefit Brazil's 
economy - the development of a rail network across the Amazon region 
in lieu of much costlier road construction.  Minister Bernardo said 
he had a number of other "big infrastructure projects" in mind (but 
did not give specifics), and agreed with Secretary Paulson's 
suggestion to increase future staff-level dialogue.
