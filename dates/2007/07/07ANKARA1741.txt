SUBJECT: TURKEY/IRAQ: TURKEY MEDEVACS INJURED FROM TUZ 
KORMATO BOMBING, WILLING TO DO MORE 
 
REF: SIEBENTRITT-BAGHDAD EMAILS -- JULY 7-8 
 
¶1. (SBU) Action request at para 4. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Foreign Ministry's Iraq office expressed to us 
their appreciation for USG assistance in facilitating the 
dispatch of two Turkish military medevac aircraft to Kirkuk 
on July 8 to pick up 21 Iraqis severely injured in the July 7 
bombing in Tuz Kormato.  Turkish officials acknowledged that 
their desire to help in this way was motivated by the 
destructiveness of the attack as well as the fact that many 
Turkmen, whom Turkey regards as ethnic cousins, were victims 
of the blast. 
 
¶3. (SBU) MFA Iraq desk officer Yagmur Guldere told us late 
July 8 that the GOT is prepared to send the two medevac 
aircraft back to Kirkuk, if requested, to evacuate more 
wounded for treatment at military and civilian hospitals in 
Ankara.  He said the two aircraft could accommodate as many 
as 28 wounded and their escorts.  Turkey would be willing to 
send medical supplies and equipment to northern Iraq using 
the same aircraft, and could even dispatch doctors to work at 
hospitals in northern Iraq for a short period of time. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Action Request: Please advise if further Turkish 
assistance in the areas of medevac, medical supplies, and 
medical staff to deal with the aftermath of the Tuz Kormato 
bombing would be desirable.  If so, post is willing to assist 
with coordination.
