SUBJECT: MURDER OF NICARAGUAN NATIONAL POLICE COMMISSIONER 
OBANDO 
 
¶1.  (C) Summary:  Comisionado Manuel Guillermo Obando, member 
of the Nicaraguan National Police (NNP) Vetted Unit, an 
anti-drug investigation unit supported by the US Embassy 
Managua INL and the Drug Enforcement Administration was found 
murdered July 12, 2007.  Two of his neighbors are under 
police custody as the principal suspects in the homicide, but 
the case remains open. At this point the Embassy does not 
believe that Comisionado Obando's murder resulted from his 
involvement with the Vetted Unit. End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (C) The last reported contact with Comisionado Obando 
occurred July 7, 2007, but because he was a recovering 
alcoholic and his birthday was July 8, he was not reported 
missing to DEA by head of the NNP Vetted Unit Comisionado 
Mayor Miguel Garcia Duarte until July 12, 2007 when his 
vehicle was discovered under suspicious circumstances in the 
Reparto Schick neighborhood.  Witnesses report that at least 
two people left the car on the night of July 11, 2007.  A 
citizen called the police about the vehicle on the morning of 
the 12th; responding police elements found the radio 
faceplate, spare tire and hub caps of the car were all 
missing. (Later, the license plates were found in the trunk.) 
 The car itself was unlocked with the keys in the ignition. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) That evening, a body believed to be Comisionado 
Obando was discovered in Managua at Kilometer 8 1/2 of the 
New Highway to Leon.  The body was found by a passer-by in a 
field approximately 75 yards from the road with hands and 
feet bound and dressed only in shorts.  Based on the 
condition of the body, NNP believes time of death to be July 
7, 2007, but besides the confirmation of identity no forensic 
evidence has been released. 
 
¶4.  (C) To date, NNP have not provided DEA with an official 
report; however, they did report to the press on July 15 that 
they believed Comisionado Obando had been murdered in his 
residence in Barrio Jose Dolores Estrada.  Despite several 
abdominal perforations, the ultimate cause of death was loss 
of blood due to a stab wound to the jugular vein.  Based on 
the sheets from the house found with the body and blood 
stains in the residence, police determined that the site of 
the murder was the victim's bedroom.  The Comisionado,s cell 
phone, mattress, briefcase, tie, and NNP issued handgun were 
all missing.  The other residences of the house claimed to be 
absent at the time of the attack. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Two defendants, Hector Antonio Aragon-Roa, 22, and 
Luis Miguel Ordonez Leiva, 19, identified as the victim,s 
neighbors, were taken into police custody as suspects.  Some 
of the Comisionado's missing personal effects were found in 
the home of defendant Hector Antonio Aragon Roa, and the 
defendants' subsequent confession led to the discovery of the 
mattress on the opposite side the highway from where 
Comisionado Obando's body was recovered.  Police are still 
investigating others suspected of involvement, including 
Comisionado Obando,s oldest son, Guillermo Manuel Obando, 
with whom he had a troubled relationship. Most recently, NNP 
have arrested Milton Leonardo Rayo Mirando, 31, and Cristian 
Armando Rivas Morales, 25, who were also in possession of 
some of the Commisionado,s personal effects, which they 
claim to have received from suspects Ordonez and Aragon. 
 
¶6.  (C) The murderers' motives remain unclear and the case 
remains open; however, all indications support the conclusion 
that the homicide was not linked to Comisionado Obando's 
position in the Vetted Unit. The most recent NNP theory is 
the murder was financially and/or personally motivated.  The 
Comisionado had three separate life-insurance policies, one 
for $50,000 US dollars, and two others totaling approximately 
$27,000 US dollars. We will report on receipt of additional 
information.
