to Identify Counterfeits

(U) This document is sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect 
accordingly. 
 
¶1. (U) Summary: At a recent post-organized seminar, five U.S. 
companies and a music industry association trained 70 working-level 
officials from Guangdong Customs on ways to distinguish genuine 
products from counterfeits.  The companies highlighted recent trends 
in manufacturing and exporting.  Guangdong Customs employs 37 
percent of China's Customs officials; the province accounts for 
one-third of China's exports.  End summary. 
 
Industry and Customs Attendees 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (U) U.S. attendees at the June 29 product ID seminar were from 
Pfizer, Eli Lilly, Microsoft, Wrigley, Coach, and the International 
Federation of Phonographic Industries (IFPI - a music industry 
association).  Attending on the Chinese side were 70 Guangdong 
Customs officers, representing all seven Customs jurisdictions in 
Guangdong.  Most of the officers in attendance were office 
manager-rank and thus closely involved in day-to-day enforcement 
activities.  Also in attendance were one or two officials from the 
General Administration of Customs (GAC) legal affairs department, 
who had traveled from Beijing.  Guangdong Customs officials account 
for 37 percent of Customs officials in China, according to the 
director of the training center. 
 
¶3. (U) The seminar took place at the China Customs Education and 
Training Center in Guangzhou.  The training center serves all of 
South China and is one of three such facilities in China, the other 
two being in Shanghai and Tianjin.  It provides training at all 
levels of the Customs bureaucracy. 
 
Presentations: How to Spot Fakes 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Most representatives began their presentations with 
background on their companies, introducing the brands and products 
they manufacture.  They described the identifying characteristics of 
counterfeit products, including materials, labels and packaging, and 
associated documentation.  They also used numerous photographs of 
legitimate as well as fake products in their presentations.  Some 
presenters identified "problem areas" in China and export 
destinations.  They sometimes quizzed the officials on whether a 
product was legitimate or fake.  Microsoft and IFPI discussed the 
manufacturing process of optical discs.  Pfizer, Eli Lilly, and 
Wrigley emphasized the health risks associated with counterfeits in 
their industries. 
 
¶5. (U) All of the U.S. participants left a copy of their Powerpoint 
presentation with the training center and distributed paper handouts 
with product and anti-counterfeiting information for the Customs 
officers to take to their district offices.  They gave out their 
contact information (including cell phone numbers and email 
addresses) and encouraged the officials to contact them if they 
found suspicious shipments.  The seminar did not include a question 
and answer period.  Our Customs contacts nixed it as it would have 
required an additional, burdensome approval process. 
 
Guangdong Customs a Willing Partner Despite WTO Case 
------------------------- -------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Post organized a similar product ID seminar in July 2006 
with Guangdong Customs that included Nike, P&G, Disney, Mattel, 
Acushnet, General Motors, and MPA (reftel).  Previous attempts to 
include a broader range of Chinese IP enforcement agencies proved 
unsuccessful because of the complexities of interagency 
coordination.  Guangdong Customs has been cooperative and responsive 
and clearly sees the benefits of this type of training (the 2007 
Guangdong IPR White Paper made specific mention of the 2006 event). 
The General Administration of Customs (GAC) took longer than usual 
to approve the request - approximately one month - likely because of 
the April U.S. WTO consultation request.  Though it is difficult to 
know, the MOU signed by DHS and GAC at the May Strategic Economic 
Dialogue may have helped get the event approved.

Comment: Aiming for the Source 
------------------------------ 
 
¶7. (U) Guangdong province is responsible for one-third of China's 
overall trade and is an engine of China's manufacturing industry - 
and the "heart of darkness" for IPR infringement.  The export of 
counterfeit products to global markets is a growing concern for U.S. 
companies and, as the recent food safety scandals have illustrated, 
U.S. consumers.  Guangdong Customs, with its reputation for being 
well-trained and its significance in terms of size, will remain an 
important partner in post's anti-counterfeiting advocacy and 
training efforts.
