SUBJECT: BRIEFING ON DECLARATION ON NUCLEAR ENERGY AND 
NONPROLIFERATION - PROVIDED TO FRENCH AUTHORITIES 
 
REF: SECSTATE 93192 
 
¶1.  (U) As instructed reftel, on July 9, ESTH Counselor, 
together with Russian Embassy disarmament expert, Dr. Igor 
Kondratskiy, called on Martin Briens, Head of the Disarmament 
and Nuclear Nonproliferation Office, and Jean Cazalet, 
Adviser on Civilian Nuclear Matters, Economic Affairs 
Department, MFA to present the 'Declaration on Nuclear Energy 
and Nonproliferation' and discuss its contents.  Thierry 
Ethvignot, North America Desk Officer for the French Atomic 
Energy Commission also attended the meeting. 
 
¶2.  (U) Briens responded to the U.S. and Russian 
presentations, which were identical, very positively that 
"France fully shares in the goals of the instrument."  He 
also referred to the Declaration as "timely," pointing out 
that when the idea of having specific countries provide for 
international nuclear fuel supply first arose several years 
ago, it was not then "ripe."  Briens said that a confluence 
of factors and events, among them the U.S.-led GNEP 
initiative, as well as global climate concerns, make the 
Declaration a proposal whose time has come. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The French side, however, asked questions to which 
neither Kondratskiy nor ESTH Counselor could reply with 
precision.  Generally, the Russian and U.S. presenters 
highlighted that the Declaration provided clear direction, 
and intent for an expanded nuclear energy future, bearing 
constantly in mind the nonproliferation challenge.  The 
Declaration contained a strong statement of political will on 
the part of the two leaders.  Nonetheless, Briens asked about 
specific, practical mechanisms for implementation, other than 
those mentioned in the Declaration's text, such as GNEP or 
IAEA.  What would third countries receiving nuclear fuel from 
a designated fuel supply country be required to do to become 
eligible for such fuel; might they be required, for example, 
"to renounce" their sovereign right to enrich uranium?, the 
French side queried.  There were questions about the 
bilateral agreement, to which Kondratskiy and ESTH Counselor 
demurred.  Briens also asked about the financial mechanisms 
alluded to in the text of the Declaration.
