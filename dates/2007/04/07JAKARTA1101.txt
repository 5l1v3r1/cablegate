SUBJECT: VIRGINIA TECH UNIVERSITY CONDOLENCE LETTER FROM 
MINISTER WIRAJUDA 
 
 ¶1. (SBU) On the margins of a dinner late April 18 in honor 
of the participants of the Indonesia/United States Strategic 
Dialogue, we received the following letter from Foreign 
Minister Hassan Wirajuda to the Secretary: 
 
Begin Text: 
 
Dear Secretary Rice, 
 
I join a shocked world in grieving over the tragedy that 
befell a large number of students, including one Ph.D. 
student from Indonesia, at the Virginia Tech University on 
Monday 16 April 2007. 
 
This enormous loss of lives becomes even grievous when you 
consider what the deceased victims could have done for their 
respective communities had they lived to apply the learning 
they had acquired from the University. 
 
At this time of sorrow, I wish to convey, on behalf of the 
Government and people of Indonesia, our deepest sympathy and 
condolences to you and the Government and people of the 
United States of America, especially the bereaved families 
who lost their loved ones in this appalling tragedy. 
 
We are praying that they will soon recover from the impact of 
this great misfortune. 
 
Accept, Excellency, the assurances of my highest esteem. 
 
Dr. N. Hassan Wirajuda 
 
Her Excellency 
Dr. Condoleezza Rice 
Secretary of State
