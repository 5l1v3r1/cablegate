TREATY CONSULTATIVE MEETING 
 
REF: SECSTATE 42866 
 
¶1. (SBU) Econoff delivered reftel demarche on the upcoming 
Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) to Mr. Jukka 
Nikulainen, First Secretary in the Northern Dimension unit of 
the GOF Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  The Finnish delegation 
to the ATCM meeting includes: 
-Ambassador Erik Ulfstedt, Head of Delegation, MFA 
-Jukka Nikulainen, MFA Northern Dimension unit 
-Marja Pohjanpalo, MFA Treaty Law unit 
-Tuomas Kuokkanen, Ministry of Environment 
-Outi Mahonen, Ministry of Environment 
 
¶2. (SBU) Nikulainen said the Finnish delegation was generally 
pleased with the U.S. working paper for controlling tourism 
in the Antarctic and they would speak in favor of the 
proposal.  Nikulainen said their delegation was especially 
pleased that the U.S. proposal focused on environmental 
protection as the basis for regulating tourism in the region. 
 Nikulainen said Finland, in principle, supports the U.S. 
proposal to limit the number passengers on tour ships to less 
than 500, as well limiting the total number of passengers at 
any one time and requiring guides for groups of less than 20 
passengers.  Nikulainen agreed that IMO needs to play a 
strong role in approving shipping issues as outlined in the 
U.S. proposal. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Nikulainen said they have no opinion on the proposed 
U.S. research stations in the region.  Their delegation is 
hoping to learn more before deciding; however, Finland is 
generally supportive of polar research especially given the 
International Polar Year commemoration.
