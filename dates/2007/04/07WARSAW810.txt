AGREEMENT 
 
REF: SECSTATE 43305 
 
Econoff delivered reftel demarche to Sylwia Ciszewska, 
Director of the Air Transport Department of the Civil 
Aviation Office.  Ciszewska confirmed that Poland's Permanent 
Representative to the EU, Mr. Jan Tombinski, will sign the 
agreement during the COREPER meeting on April 25.  Ciszewska 
noted that the only potential obstacle is that Poland is 
awaiting the Polish translation of the agreement from the 
Council.  The Polish translation is required before Poland 
can conduct its internal procedures.  Internal procedures 
involve approval of the Cabinet of Ministers, and will not 
require approval of the parliament.  Ciszewska anticipates 
receiving the translation in time for all to go smoothly at 
the April 25 COREPER meeting.
