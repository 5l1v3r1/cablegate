¶1.  (U)   This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 
five. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Iranian Threat Weighs on MOI; MOI Requests 
Threat Brief and Addition to Agenda for JWG 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (S)  During an April 21 meeting, Ministry of Interior 
Chief of Staff Major General Dr. Saad al Jabri continued to 
communicate his deep concern with the threat posed by Iran to 
Saudi Arabia's  petroleum infrastructure.  His concerns track 
those expressed by Assistant Minister of Interior Mohammed 
bin Nayif in ref B.  Dr. al Jabri requested a briefing from 
the CIA and other related intelligence or military agencies 
on the threat Iran presents to petroleum facilities in Saudi 
Arabia's Eastern Province, in an inter-agency meeting 
attended by Energy Attache Ross, CIA energy Analysts XXXXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXXXX, and XXXXXXXXXXXX, and BPM Officers Seyer and Moraga.  Dr. al Jabri requested the threat brief be included as part of the April 30 JWG, stating Saudi Ambassador to the U.S. Al-Jubeir would attend, and would then be in a position to 
brief King Abdullah.  In ref A, Joint Working Group (JWG) on 
critical infrastructure protection (CIP) Saudi Co-Chair Dr. 
Saud Al-Semari also requested we add an additional component 
to the JWG agenda, "Threat Assessment and Countermeasures." 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Iranian Threat Backdrop to Accelerated JWG 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (S)  Dr. Jabri explained the MOI had moved the next 
meeting of the JWG forward from June until April 30 because 
of its concerns with the situation in the Gulf, specifically 
increased hostilities with Iran.  He also highlighted 
increasing threats from Saudi Arabia's and neighboring Shi'a, 
and the threat posed by the Saudi Hezbollah.  Dr. al Jabri 
noted neither the MOI nor the Ministry of Defense and 
Aviation sufficiently understood Iranian capabilities to 
allow for appropriate contingency planning for continued oil 
operations or recovery from a significant attack.  He stated 
it would not have to be a highly accurate missile to cause 
serious operational damage to Saudi oil operations, even a 
"stupid" missile could do so.  He expressed his worries with 
a "layered" attack by both military forces and terrorists, 
which could then be compounded by a Shi'a reaction in the 
Eastern Province.   He stated, "we would like to be prepared 
for worst case scenarios, we do not want any surprises." 
 
------------------------------------ 
Internal Aramco Threat Concerns MOI 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶4.  (S)  Finally, Dr. al Jabri also highlighted the MOI's 
concern with the threat posed by internal sabotage from Saudi 
Aramco employees.  He stated there were Saudi Aramco 
employees known by MOI to be members of extremist groups. 
 
--------------- 
Action Request 
--------------- 
 
¶5.  (S)  S/CT please advise if an interagency threat brief 
can be presented during the April 30 JWG meeting to address 
Saudi concerns with the Iranian threat to petroleum 
facilities, and possible follow-up contingency planning. 
Please advise if "Threat Assessment and Countermeasures" item 
can be added to the JWG agenda.

Comment

¶6.  (S)  Post believes these are serious and legitimate 
requests which will make the JWG significantly more useful 
for our Saudi counterparts.  We hope these requests can be 
granted.
