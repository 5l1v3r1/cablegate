¶1.  (U) We conveyed ref A paper on April 26 to Department of 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) Senior Policy 
Advisor for Non-proliferation Michael Blackmore and Policy 
Officer David Da Silva.  Blackmore expressed appreciation for 
the U.S. readout, noted that it tracked with his take on the 
Auckland meeting, which he had attended, and said it would 
help him organize his upcoming PSI briefing for senior DFAIT 
officials. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Blackmore added that he had been impressed by New 
Zealand's Model National Response Plan and by its PSI 
outreach in Pacific island states.  He said Canadian 
authorities were thinking about conducting similar outreach 
in the WHA region with a high-profile Latin American partner 
nation, perhaps Chile (whose presence in Auckland Canada had 
promoted and underwritten).  Blackmore said he would be 
interested in consulting with U.S. officials on PSI outreach 
in Latin America and the Caribbean.
