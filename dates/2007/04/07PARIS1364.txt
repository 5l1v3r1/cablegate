¶1.  (U) On April 5, German Embasssy First Secretary Stefan 
Krawielicki and Poloff delivered a joint demarche to French 
MFA Director of Archives Jean Mendelson concerning the 
opening of the International Tracing Service (ITS) archives 
for the purpose of research and the provision of copies of 
archive material to interested ITS Commission member states. 
Poloff and colleague specifically encouraged the GOF to 
complete its relevant domestic approval procedures 
expeditiously and urged the GOF to support the motion the USG 
plans to table at the annual meeting of the International 
Commission in Amsterdam on May 14-15, 2007 on an advance 
technical distribution of the electronic data. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Mendelson related that the GOF appreciated the need 
for haste in providing access to the archive, particularly in 
light of the advanced age of Holocaust survivors, and said 
that the GOF favored distribution of advance digital copies 
of the archive before all Commission member states had 
effectuated the necessary domestic arrangements to receive 
the information.
