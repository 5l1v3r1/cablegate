¶2. (SBU) Description of persecution claim, as reported by Ehab: Ehab 
Al Kuttub has worked for the US government or for USG-funded 
organizations since August 2003.  He worked first as the head of the 
Procurement Unit at USAID, a position he held for almost two years. 
During this period, as his association with the USG became better 
know, Ehab said he was insulted by his neighbors and accused of 
being a spy for the Americans. Ehab said he was also verbally 
threatened and was once attacked by the local police.  Ehab said 
that he was increasingly afraid for his own life, especially since 
it well known that he worked for the US, both within his own 
neighborhood and in the areas around the Green Zone, because his 
procurement work required him to interact with local shop keepers 
and vendors. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Ehab quit his job at USAID after one of his colleagues was 
shot to death because of his employment with  USAID.  He then worked 
for approximately one month with Babylon Gates, a USG contractor in 
the Green Zone.  However Ehab become increasingly fearful because of 
his high visibility moving in and out of the Green Zone, and asked 
for a different job outside of the Green Zone.  Around July 2006, he 
began working  at the International Relief Development (IRD), 
another contractor to USAID. He worked there for almost four months 
until he received a threatening letter, attached to his house door. 
The letter accused him of being a spy for the Americans, saying he 
was "working for the masters."  It called him a traitor and said he 
was a spy targeting the Shia people.  Ehab believes that the letter 
came from the El Mahadi militias; Because of this letter, Ehab and 
his family feared that he would be abducted or killed.  He contacted 
relatives in Sweden to ask for their help.  They introduced him to a 
smuggler in Iraq who provided him with travel documents and helped 
him leave the country. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  In October 2006, Ehab fled Iraq using a fraudulent Iraqi 
passport.  He went first to India via Dubai. He spent in India 10 
days and then traveled to Syria where he stayed for one month.  He 
got a fraudulent Swedish passport with the help of a smuggler and 
arrived in Egypt on Jan. 22, 2007. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Justification for resettlement: Ehab is known to USAID, 
where he worked for approximately two years, and was an employee in 
good standing.   Refcoord met with Ehab and believes that he has a 
genuine fear of persecution because of his work with the US 
government.   He showed Refcoord a copy of an "On the Spot Cash 
Awards Program" letter from his supervisor at USAID.  It was signed 
by Fernando Cossich, S/EXO, and dated 3/27/05, nominating him for an 
award because of his excellent service. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Note:  Ehab may have a possible serious medical condition 
that could require urgent treatment.  We are encouraging him to seek 
medical care in Egypt as quickly as possible.
