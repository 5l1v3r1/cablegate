¶1. (SBU) Econoff delivered reftel demarche on the World 
Meteorological Organization (WMO) Congress to Finnish 
Meteorological Institute (FMI) and Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs (MFA) officials.  (For a complete list see paragraph 
5.)  While the Finnish delegation generally agreed with the 
U.S. position as outlined in the non-paper, they were quite 
insistent that the role of the WMO be expanded to include a 
mandate for additional work on climate change.  The 
delegation views the WMO as the heir apparent for addressing 
global climate change, particularly as it relates to 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issues. 
They cited the close collaboration between WMO and UNEP as 
the basis for expanding WMO,s role on climate change. 
Finland believes additional resources should be devoted to 
capacity-building and training programs, as well as WMO,s 
Disaster Prevention and Mitigation (DPM) program. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Finland agrees that the WMO should improve severe 
weather modeling, and that THORPEX is an important tool that 
should be supported by all WMO members.  Finland would 
support WMO hosting a World Climate Conference in the future, 
but only if the timing makes sense and the conference has 
clear, concrete goals that would facilitate a post-2012 
climate change agreement. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Finland plans to support the WMO 
Secretary-General,s budget proposal for zero nominal growth.

 The delegation felt a subcommittee preparing budgets in 
advance of the meeting would be a good step forward.  The 
delegation was also supportive of measures for improving 
transparency of the WMO, such as the Swiss proposal outlines. 
 The delegation stressed that a strong WMO is a Finnish 
priority since it provides international benefits and support 
for developing countries, leading to improved international 
security. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Delegation member Alestalo continuously linked the 
efforts of the WMO with addressing climate change head on. 
He commented that most European countries don,t need the WMO 
for basic weather and climate observations, rather European 
countries are far more interested in the strong international 
role that the WMO could provide in addressing climate change. 
 He continued by linking global warming with international 
security and unrest, citing the recent report "National 
Security and the Threat of Climate Change" commissioned by 
the USG-funded Center for Naval Analyses. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Reftel demarche was delivered to Mr. Mikko Alestalo, 
Deputy Director General at the Finnish Meteorological 
Institute (FMI), Ms. Maria Hurtola, Head of International 
Affairs Unit (FMI), Ms. Marja-Liisa Ahtiainen, International 
Affairs Unit (FMI) and Tanja Leikas, Project Assistant from 
the Unit for International Environmental Policy at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA).  Alestalo, Hurtola, and 
Ahtiainen will participate in the Finnish delegation, which 
will be lead by Mr. Pekka Plathan, Permanent Representative 
of Finland to WMO.
