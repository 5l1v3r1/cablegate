¶1. (SBU) Summary:  On April 26, Egypt publicly offered a 
significant contribution for the AU/UN Darfur heavy support 
package (HSP), contingent upon Sudanese government approval. 
MOD contacts confirmed that the GOE has offered between 1200 
and 1900 troops.  Egypt has asked the UN to provide further 
funding for the peacekeeping operation.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On April 26, Assistant Minister of Defense Major 
General Fouad Abd El Halim confirmed to poloff local press 
reports that Egypt has offered the UN a significant 
contribution for Darfur peacekeeping operations.  According 
to MG Fouad, Egypt will contribute between 1200 and 1900 
personnel: one to two mechanized infantry battalions (680 to 
1360 troops), 100 military observers, 30 headquarters staff 
for plans and command, one transport company (200 personnel), 
one signals company (150 personnel), and a field hospital 
(approximately 60 personnel).  Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul 
Gheit said in an April 27 press statement that Egypt would be 
willing to consider sending more troops in the future. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In his pubic remarks, Aboul Gheit noted that the GOE 
offer was contingent on Bashir's acceptance of the HSP.  MG 
Fouad stressed this point to poloff. Specifically, Aboul 
Gheit stated that Egypt advocates deploying the HSP to 
Darfur, as "the Sudanese government has recently informed the 
UN of its approval of the support packages."  Egypt views 
Bashir's acceptance of the HSP and follow-on UN/AU hybrid 
force as genuine, and worries that US sanctions, if 
implemented, could damage prospects for implementation of the 
UN force (reftel). 
 
¶4. (SBU) In his April 27 statement, Aboul Gheit called upon 
the UN to respond to the Egyptian offer by providing funds 
for Darfur peacekeeping.  Egypt has previously been 
disappointed by UN and AU responses to Egyptian troop offers 
(reftel).
