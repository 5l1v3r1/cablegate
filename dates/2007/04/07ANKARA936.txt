SUBJECT: TURKS CONCERNED ABOUT UNBALANCED ARMENIAN GENOCIDE 
PROGRAM TO BE AIMED ON AL HURRA 
 
¶1. (SBU)  Turkish MFA Deputy Director General for Security 
Affairs Sakir Torunlar called us in April 18, under 
instructions, to express concern about a program they had 
heard would be aired on Iraqi TV station Al Hurra soon 
regarding allegations of Armenian genocide.  Torunlar said 
that, were this a commercial station with advertisers, it 
might be understandable, but al Hurra appears to be 
congressionally funded.  This was neither the appropriate 
time nor the appropriate audience, he emphasized, for such a 
film.  If it made it into the Turkish press, the reactions 
would be very unpleasant.  Deputy U/S Haydar Berk, in a 
separate meeting, made similar points to the Ambassador. 
 
¶2. (SBU) We shared information that the Turkish desk in 
Washington had been in touch with the programmers, who had 
reviewed the film for balance.  We stressed that it would be 
the station's call, not the Embassy's or the State 
Department's.  We noted that there is an issue of freedom of 
the press.  We pointed out that these sorts of issues will 
continue to arise until Turkey and Armenia take concrete 
steps toward normalizing relations. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment:  The MFA's attention to detail shows 
continuing Turkish sensitivities on this issue.  It is one of 
the prisms through which they view the world and will 
continue until the sore is lanced.  We hope that can occur 
after parliamentary elections later this year and formation 
of a new government with a fresh mandate.  End comment.
