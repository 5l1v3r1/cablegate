POLITICAL 
 
EKSPRES / BOLGE:        Anavatan (Motherland Party) Leader Erkan Mumcu 
held a public meeting in Adana.  During his address to the 
people, Mumcu reacted harshly to the statements of Massoud 
Barzani, president of Iraqi regional authority, which said that 
if Turkey conducted a cross border operation in northern Iraq, 
then they would conduct an operation in Diyarbakir.  Mumcu 
suggested that, if Turkey closed the Habur Border Gate in Sirnak 
for three days, then people would perceive the reality that 
Turkey was not a small country that they would easily play with. 
 
 
EKSPRES:        MHP Provincial Chairperson Yilmaz Tankut issued a 
statement to mark the 162nd anniversary of the foundation of 
Turkish National Police.  Tankut, who said that the police 
organization was the pride of the country, pointed out that 
regulations imposed on Turkey by the EU and the government's 
alleged yielding attitude towards the illegal circles, were 
weakening the position of the police. 
 
ZAMAN / EVRENSEL:       An office of the Council of State recently 
overturned the appeal of the Diyarbakir Mayor Osman Baydemir who 
objected to the investigation started by the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs on November 28, 2006 on the grounds that 
Baydemir violated a law on the use of the Turkish alphabet and 
sent an invitation for a festival in Diyarbakir to the 
Diyarbakir Prosecutor in both Kurdish and Turkish on an 
unspecified date in the past. 
 
EVRENSEL:       DTP Diyarbakir provincial chairperson Hilmi 
Aydogudu, who was arrested in late February because of his press 
statement that reportedly claimed that they would regard an 
attack targeting Kirkuk as an attack on Diyarbakir, was released 
early in April, but will stand trial for his statements.  Today, 
Evrensel daily publishes an interview with Aydogdu, who 
complained that some of his statements were deliberately pulled 
out of context by the media and were portrayed as if his remarks 
carried hostile intentions.  Aydogdu, who stayed in prison for 
41 days, blamed the authorities for pursuing aggressive policies 
towards them. 
 
SECURITY 
 
EVRENSEL:       Two soldiers and a village guard died during

judges, prosecutors and the military personnel.  The police 
found material used in devising a bomb, 11 kilograms of 
explosives, three alarm clocks, and varius other material in the 
car and the at house of the arrestees. 
 
ZAMAN / EKSPRES / BOLGE / HURRIYET (CUKUROVA):  A bomb attack 
hit a police station in Adana's Daglioglu quarter at 00.10 am 
Sunday morning.  A police car was damaged badly and the impact 
caused a hole in the wall of the police station.  The bomb was 
left in a trash can in front of the station.  Witnesses said 
that an unanonynmous person(s) opened fire with an RPG from a
