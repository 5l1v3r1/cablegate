¶1.  According to local media reports, Taiwan has developed a 
cell-based vaccine to counter the H5N1 Avian influenza (AI) 
virus.  The government-funded National Health Research 
Institutes (NHRI) took just one year and NT$40 million (about 
$1.21 million) to successfully develop the vaccine. 
 
¶2. The cell-based vaccine is derived from dog kidney cells 
which until now have not been used in any vaccine production. 
 The cell-based technology was chosen over the usual poultry 
egg-based method in view of a likely shortage of eggs during 
an AI epidemic.  Taiwan Center of Disease Control contacts 
(TCDC) told AIT that the new vaccines will provide a source 
of vaccines should an AI epidemic hit the island and will be 
tested on humans next year.  Before that takes place the 
facilities where the vaccine are to be produced need to be 
certified by the health authorities. 
 
¶3.  According to TCDC contacts, NHRI could produce 7,000 
doses a month and plans to increase this tenfold once a pilot 
plant is built.  Taiwan has stockpiled 190,000 doses of human 
H5N1 vaccines imported from Belgium and Austria.  In an 
effort to increase their preparation against a flu epidemic 
Taiwan health officials had previously authorized a 
compulsory license to local drug firms to manufacture Tamiflu 
(reftel). 
 
¶4.  Taiwan has detected less virulent strains of AI in bird 
droppings last year and in January.  A total of 467,000 
chickens have been destroyed to date after the H5N2 strain 
was discovered on chicken farms on Kinmen island.  The 
island, although controlled by Taiwan, is located just 
offshore mainland China and is 
vulnerable to transmission of AI from the mainland. 
 
¶5.  Comment.  This vaccine, if proved safe and effective, 
could give Taiwan the ability to produce AI vaccines on 
demand, and not subject it to licensing requirements that 
apply for producing vaccines developed outside Taiwan.  End 
comment.
