SUBJECT: TANZANIA TO COMPLY WITH EXPANDED SANCTIONS ON IRAN 
UNDER UNSCR 1747 
 
REF: STATE 37801 
 
¶1. (SBU) Ambassador Begum Taj, Head of the Multilateral 
Affairs Division at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told 
Poloff on April 3 that she was fully aware of expanded 
sanctions on Iran under UN Security Council Resolution 
(UNSCR) 1747.  Taj said that the Government of Tanzania (GOT) 
would honor its obligations to strengthen sanctions in 
response to Iran's non-compliance under UNSCR 1737. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Poloff emphasized that Tanzania, as a UN Member 
state, was required to report to the Sanctions Committee by 
May 24, 2007 the steps it had taken to implement UNSCR 1747's 
provisions.  Ambassador Taj noted that the May 24 timeframe 
was not realistic given a lack of capacity with the GOT.  "It 
takes quite a bit of time for us to disseminate and then 
collect all the pertinent information from the key 
ministries," she said.  Poloff asked what would be the 
earliest date Tanzania could report back to the Sanctions 
Committee; Taj responded that 90 days from adoption of the 
resolution (March 24) would be sufficient time to complete 
its report.
