SUBJECT: APRIL 10 MFA PRESS BRIEFING: SIX-PARTY TALKS, 
SUDAN, SOUTH CHINA SEA, VISITS 
 
¶1. Key Points at the April 10 MFA Press Conference by MFA 
Spokesman Qin Gang were: 
 
--  The MFA would not comment on the likelihood of the DPRK's 
meeting the April 13 deadline, nor would they give details on 
A/S Hill's visit to Beijing or a possible meeting with VFM Wu. 
 
--  Asked if China was to blame for the BDA impasse, Qin said 
China and Macau financial institutions must follow 
responsibilities under international laws and regulations. 
 
--  AFM Zhai Jun proposed a solution to the Darfur issue in 
meetings with President al-Bashir, but Qin declined to give 
further details. 
 
-- Sudan "on principle" is willing to work and discuss the 
details of former UN Secretary General Annan's plan for a 
joint UN/AU peacekeeping force in Darfur. 
 
-- Vietnam's "new moves" in the Spratly Islands are "illegal 
and invalid," as they infringe on China's undisputed 
sovereignty of the Islands and violate Sino-Vietnamese 
agreements. 
 
6PT Deadlines, BDA, A/S Hill-VFM Wu Meeting 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. MFA Spokesman Qin Gang at the April 10 regular press 
briefing deflected a question on whether Yongbyon would be 
shut down by the "sixty-day deadline," reiterating that the 
resolve and common consensus among all parties remained 
unchanged.  The Six-Party Talks have never been "smooth 
sailing" and encountering difficulties in the process of 
implementing the initial actions is natural, he added.  Also 
on the topic of Yongbyon, Qin suggested reporters see DRPK 
VFM Kim Kye-gwan's remarks in a meeting with Governor 
Richardson of New Mexico. 
 
¶3. The spokesman had heard news that A/S Hill will visit 
Beijing this week but did not provide any details.  Asked if 
A/S Hill would meet with VFM Wu Dawei, Qin said he had not 
heard of plans for such a meeting.  However, he reported VFM 
Wu is in the ROK with PM Wen and A/S Hill is in Asia as well. 
 
¶4. Asked if China should be held accountable for the Banco 
Delta Asia issue which held up the most recent phase of 
Six-Party Talks, Qin told the Japanese reporter if she does 
not understand why the Bank of China did not accept the money 
transfer she can ask a Japanese bank if it would do so.  The 
spokesman noted the United States and DPRK are the principal 
parties involved and that the concerns of all parties, 
including China and Macau, must be addressed.  Both China and 
Macau financial institutions have to follow their 
responsibilities and obligations under international laws and 
regulations. 
 
AFM Zhai Makes Proposal to Sudan President 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶5. During his recent visit to Sudan AFM Zhai Jun proposed a 
solution to the Darfur issue in meetings with President 
al-Bashir of Sudan and other senior leaders, in addition to 
visiting three refugee camps.  Qin declined to give details 
on the so-called "proposal," stating the MFA will provide 
more information after AFM Zhai returns to Beijing.  Qin 
added that Sudan "on principle" is willing to work and 
discuss the details of former UN Secretary General Annan's 
plan and is willing to coordinate with other parities.  China 
hopes that UN troops will be deployed.  The UN and AU should 
cooperate on the details.  The spokesman also reported VFM 
Dai Bingguo spoke on the phone with Deputy Secretary 
Negroponte about the Darfur issue, and called for a solution 
to be reached through political negotiations. 
 
United States Files WTO Complaints 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶6. Asked for comments on WTO complaints filed against China 
by the United States on issues of IPR violations and market 
access, Qin referred reporters to a statement released by the 
Ministry of Commerce. 
 
Vietnam Moves in Spratly Islands "Illegal and Invalid" 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶7. Vietnam's "new moves" in the Spratly Islands are "illegal 
and invalid," as they infringe on China's undisputed 
sovereignty of the Islands and violate the Declaration on the 
Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, said Qin when 
prompted by a CCTV reporter.  All parties have made efforts 
 
BEIJING 00002360  002 OF 002 
 
 
to ensure the stability of the South China Sea, but Vietnam's 
recent actions in the area, expanding bidding for natural 
resources and cooperating with British Petroleum on a 
pipeline violate consensus and is not conducive to peace. 
China expresses great concern and has made solemn 
representation to Vietnam. 
 
Visits: Pakistan, Hungary, Cuba 
------------------------------- 
 
 
¶8. At the invitation of PM Wen Jiabao, Pakistan PM Aziz will 
pay an official visit to China April 16-20 before attending 
the 2007 Boao Forum for Asia April 20-21.  At the invitation 
of FM Li Zhaoxing, Hungary FM Goncz will pay a working visit 
to China April 14-19 and Cuba FM Perez Roque will pay an 
official visit China April 15-18.
