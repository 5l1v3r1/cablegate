(SBU) PolOff delivered the points in reftels, including 
Secretary Rice's message, on the International Compact with 
 
SIPDIS 
Iraq (ICI) to MFA Director General for Multilateral Affairs 
Lourdes Puma on April 19.  Puma said the Foreign Minister's 
schedule was full for the near future and would definitely 
not attend.  Puma took the opportunity to reiterate, in a 
very general way, the GOE's opposition to U.S. Iraq policy. 
PolOff responded that the ICI was a major multilateral effort 
involving the UN to help Iraq develop economically; Puma 
reiterated that the Foreign Minister's schedule was full. 
Asked if another GOE representative would attend, she 
responded that it was highly unlikely.
