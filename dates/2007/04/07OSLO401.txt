¶1. (C) The Ambassador raised USG concerns over Norwegian petroleum firms´ investments in Iran with Statoil CEO Helge Lund over lunch on April 13. Although Statoil is not considering expanding its limited investments in Iran and has had a troubled history there (Lund´s predecessor was forced out in an Iranian bribery scandal), Lund stands to inherit responsibility for an expanded Iranian portfolio once a merger with Norway´s second leading petroleum firm, Norsk Hydro, is consummated. Hydro is much more actively engaged in Iran, and the Ambassador and Embassy officers have repeatedly conveyed USG and Iran Sanctions Act concerns to top Hydro executives (ref D). Washington officials also recently raised the issue directly with visiting Hydro executives (ref A).

¶2. (C) Lund told the Ambassador he is legally constrained from discussing substantive business and investment issues with Hydro CEO Eivind Reiten while European Union and other competition authorities review the proposed Statoil-Hydro merger. He could not, therefore, comment directly on Hydro´s investments in Iran and the merged company´s possible position on them. Lund did acknowledge that he would eventually be responsible to the merged company´s Board and shareholders for Iran and other investments, and that he would take USG positions into account. He added that as a general matter he thought engagement rather than sanctions is a more effective strategy to bring about change, but he recognized, without naming Iran specifically, that "there are exceptions to that."

¶3. (C) Lund did offer assurances that Statoil had no intention of expanding its own projects in Iran. Statoil´s focus is "only to complete the South Pars project," said Lund. That in itself was a major challenge, as the project has been plagued by delays, unreliable local partners, and other problems. He implied that Statoil´s Iran investments had been nothing but a headache, having had a "huge impact" on Statoil´s finances and, alluding to the bribery scandal, its management structure. He added confidentially that Statoil is conducting a low profile, but insincere, dialogue with Iranian authorities on future projects to forestall potentially hostile actions against its current investments. Lund justified the move by saying the company owed its shareholders a duty to protect what remained of its Iranian investments as best it could. He concluded that Statoil has had and would continue a frank and transparent dialogue with USG authorities on the Iran issue. "There will be no surprises on our part," concluded Lund.
