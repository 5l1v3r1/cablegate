¶1.  (SBU)  On April 19, A/DCM and Russian DCM Vladen 
Semivolos met with MFA Director for International 
Organizations Sun Suon to pass on the Global Initiative 
documents sent to each respective mission.  Prior to the 
meeting, A/DCM and Semivolos conferred on the documents sent 
by their respective capitals; the documents forwarded by 
Washington were more recent (the Russian documents were dated 
February 2007) so those were passed to Sun Suon.  Suon noted 
that the Cambodian government was pleased to receive the 
additional information and would designate RGC contact points 
following internal RGC consultations with the concerned 
ministries. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  The Russian DCM urged the Cambodian government to 
focus on the June meeting in Almaty, Kazakhstan and organize 
RGC participation.  A/DCM mentioned that the Embassy is in 
contact with RGC security officials regarding the June law 
enforcement conference in Miami, Florida.  While all agreed 
there are many opportunities for RGC participation in Global 
Initiative events, Sun Suon said that the RGC would need to 
assess which events are most relevant for an underdeveloped 
country such as Cambodia.  A/DCM explained that Armenia, 
Macedonia, and Romania have joined the initiative recently 
with Cambodia.  Suon asked if there were any other members 
from ASEAN; A/DCM responded in the negative and requested 
that Cambodia seek additional partners for the Global 
Initiative from the ASEAN region. 
¶3.  (SBU)  The Russian DCM said that his Embassy had already 
sent out a press release on Cambodia's entry to the Global 
Initiative.  We will forward RGC contact information to 
Washington when we are notified by the MFA.
