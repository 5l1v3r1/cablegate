NUCLEAR TERRORISM 
 
REF: STATE 21284 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Russian First Secretary Viatcheslav Ulasik and 
PolChief jointly presented RefTel demarche in favor of GOE 
participation in the Global Initiative (GI) to MFA DirGen for 
Multilateral Affairs Lourdes Puma Puma on April 13.  Puma 
said the GOE was considering joining the initiative based on 
a previous demarche from Russia and inquired about the date 
and level of representation at the upcoming Astana meeting. 
Ulasik said his instructions indicated the Astana meeting 
would take place in June.  PolChief urged the GOE to 
subscribe to the principles document and attend the Astana 
meeting, noting the importance of Ecuadorian participation 
and potential benefits to Ecuador. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Puma said the GOE participates in various other 
fora to safeguard and prevent proliferation of weapons of 
mass destruction and ensure its civilian nuclear agency 
complies with international standards.  Ecuador does not have 
a civilian nuclear power program but uses nuclear material 
mainly for medical applications.  The GOE participates in 
regional efforts in compliance with UN resolution 1540 and is 
in the final stages of reforming legislation to bring its 
laws into compliance with international conventions to 
safeguard nuclear material. Puma concluded by promising to 
report the joint demarche to FM Espinosa and inform us of any 
decisions taken. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Puma also raised unrelated GOE "security" concerns. 
 She cited a NAM consensus against UNSC treatment of climate 
change and energy issues, arguing these issues are handled in 
other, more appropriate fora, permitting broader 
participation in discussions.  Puma said the GOE believes 
that UNSC time freed up by dropping climate change and energy 
discussions should be devoted to discussing global 
development and poverty issues.  The GOE requests that UNSC 
member nations show greater flexibility on these issues.  We 
promised to convey these views to our respective capitals. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Comment and Action Request:  We will continue to 
press but interpret Puma's response to this demarche as 
polite but non-committal.  Additional information on the date 
and level of representation for the GI meeting in Kazakstan 
would be appreciated.  Renewed MFA interest in global 
environment and energy issues probably reflects emerging 
views of the Correa administration, particularly FM Espinosa, 
a noted environmentalist.
