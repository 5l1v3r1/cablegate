SUBJECT: RWANDAN DEFENSE FORCES TO CHANGE COMMANDER OF THE 
14TH BATTALION 
 
REF: A. KIGALI 36 
 
     ¶B. KIGALI 373 
 
¶1. (SBU) On 20 April, the Rwandan Ministry of Defense 
notified post that the new Battalion Commander for the 14th 
Battalion will be Major James Safari.  The change was made in 
order to comply with USG's notification (ref B) that no U.S. 
support could be provided to the 14th if LtCol Goodman 
Ruzibiza remained in command.  A senior Rwandan officer told 
acting DATT that Major Safari, currently the Battalion 
Executive Officer, will be promoted to LtCol and take command 
of the 14th prior to its deployment to Darfur in May.  Post 
has discovered no derogatory human rights information on 
Safari and he was previously vetted as a staff officer of the 
14th Battalion (Ref A). 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Comment. This is a smart decision by the GOR, as 
the second in command of the 14th, Safari knows the Battalion 
and is very familiar with the  officers and soldiers he will 
be commanding.  Additionally, due to the absence of LtCol 
Ruzibiza, he was the acting Battalion Commander during the 
recently completed ACOTA training.  End comment.
