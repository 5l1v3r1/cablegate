Joint Communiqu 
 
Following intensive talks on the current situation in Somalia and on 
exploring viable ways to promote reconciliation between the various 
groups in Somalia, Mr. Sherif Hassen Sheikh Adem, Chairman of the 
Somali Parliament, Mr. Hussein Mohammed Farah Aidid, Deputy Prime 
Minister and Minister of Somali Public Works, and Sheikh Sherif 
Sheikh Ahmed, Chairman of the Executive Council of the Union of 
Islamic Courts of Somalia (UIC) reached the following: 
 
We express our sincere gratitude to H.E. Isaias Afwerki, President 
of the State of Eritrea and the Eritrean people for the positive 
role they are playing in finding peaceful solutions to the Somali 
people. 
 
We send our deepest condolences to the Somali people and to the 
families of martyrs that have made grave sacrifices for the defense 
of the religion, nation, dignity and freedom. And we pray to God 
Almighty to grant the martyrs Paradise His abode and inspire their 
families with resolute patience and fortitude. 
 
We congratulate the heroic people of Somalia, and their victorious 
resistance, and we call upon all citizens everywhere to oppose the 
Ethiopian occupation, defend their country and guarantee the freedom 
and independence of the nation. 
 
We condemn the brutal occupation of Ethiopia in Somalia and call for 
its immediate withdrawal from sovereign Somali territory. 
 
We condemn the atrocities committed from Thursday 29th March to the 
1st of April 2007 by the Ethiopian armed forces that have resulted 
in the killing of approximately 1,086 civilians and wounding of 
4,244 sustaining various light and serious injuries. 
 
We condemn the destructive actions undertaken by the Deputy 
Secretary of State for African Affairs, which incited Ethiopian 
 
SIPDIS 
troops to continue down its path of destruction and genocide against 
defenseless civilians via promising financial and political support 
to continue its illegitimate war and devote Ethiopian brutal 
occupation. 
 
We ask the international community and the United Nations to 
establish a special International Tribunal in the search for the 
crimes committed against the Somali people and prosecute the 
criminals responsible for these hideous crimes. 
 
We condemn Ethiopia for establishing detention camps in its 
territory like that of 'Guantanamo Bay' in Cuba, where innocent 
people are being tortured. 
 
We inform the world that the Ugandan troops currently in Somali 
Capital is a 'Trojan Horse' for the unjust Ethiopian occupation. 
 
We regret and condemn the stand of Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda in the 
Ministerial Meeting of IGAD member states that was held on Friday 
April 13, 2007 against the independence and sovereignty of Somalia, 
where they praised and incited the brutal assault carried out by the 
Ethiopian troops in Somalia. We commend the honest and genuine 
approach of the governments of Eritrea, Sudan and Djibouti towards 
their view in the Somali issue. 
 
We request the concerned local and International humanitarian 
 
ASMARA 00000379  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
organizations to deliver urgent relief supplies to displaced Somalis 
everywhere in particular food and medical treatments because 
concentration of human population formed suddenly may result in 
sweeping epidemics such as cholera and Typhoid. 
 
We bless the meeting, which was held in the city of Leicester; 
United Kingdom from 6th to 8th April 2007 organized by the Somali 
communities living abroad including intellectuals and politicians 
that focused for consulting on unifying the views on the Ethiopian 
occupation of Somalia, and bless the communiqu reached during the 
meeting. We also urge all citizens to unite the Somali order to be 
able to overcome the challenges the country is going through. 
 
Thank you 
Asmara, 17th April 2007
