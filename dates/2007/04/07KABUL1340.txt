¶1. Three positive cases of Type A, H5N1 avian influenza in birds 
were found in the Karte Char and Karte Seh areas of Kabul City on 
April 17, 2007 and were confirmed by laboratory diagnosis at the 
Central Veterinary Diagnostic and Research Laboratories in Kabul.  A 
total of eight birds were tested.  Following confirmation of the 
diagnosis, the Ministry of Agriculture sent its teams to the area 
for culling in the index house and surrounding flocks.  A team of 
emergency surveillance personnel from the Ministry of Public Health 
has been sent to the area for primary investigation and health 
education messages for the surrounding population. Follow up 
actions, testing and education will continue to determine the 
success of the containment efforts or further spread of the 
disease. 
 
¶2. The major pattern of bird deaths and infections in Afghanistan 
appears to be primarily centered on the bird markets. The Ministry 
of Agriculture is making an effort to study the patterns of 
infection and transmission in greater detail and to provide 
incentives for commercial bird tradesmen to identify sick birds and 
seek assistance in their immediate culling and disposal. 
 
¶3. Earlier this year, the H5N1 virus had broken out in several 
districts of Nangarhar, Kunar, and Kabul provinces, following 
infection from imported birds from Pakistan (reftels).  The spread 
had been checked, and no new cases had been reported for several 
weeks.  Following the pattern of infection from earlier this year 
and last year, further new outbreaks from the illegal importation of 
birds from Pakistan can be expected.  As we did for the March 
outbreak, Embassy is preparing a warden message for the American 
community in Kabul and an administrative notice to the Embassy 
community.
