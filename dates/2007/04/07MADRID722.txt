SUBJECT: SPAIN STRONGLY SUPPORTS U.S. PROPOSAL TO LIMIT 
ANTARCTIC TOURISM 
 
REF: SECSTATE 42866 
 
¶1.  ESTHOFF made reftel points April 19 to MFA Special Envoy 
for the Antarctic Treaty Ambassador Juan Martinez-Cattaneo 
Hingston, urging Spain to support U.S. proposals to limit 
Antarctic tourism at the May thirtieth Antarctic Treaty 
Consultative Meeting (ATCM) in New Delhi.  Martinez-Cattaneo, 
who will lead the Spanish delegation to New Delhi, had 
already obtained a copy of the U.S. working paper containing 
our tourism-related proposals for the meeting.  He said that 
Spain would support "these magnificent U.S. initiatives" in 
their entirety. 
 
¶2.  Martinez-Cattaneo briefed ESTHOFF on two recent accidents 
involving tourist boats near one of the two Spanish Antarctic 
facilities.  He said these two accidents, which occurred in 
November 2006 and January 2007, illustrate the pressing need 
to better limit Antarctic tourism and will be described in 
the Spanish presentation in New Delhi.  He said a major 
tourism-related fatality causing accident in the Antarctic is 
inevitable and that we needed to act now to limit Antarctic 
tourism before it was too late.  He said Spain would be 
willing to support proposals even stronger than those 
contained in the U.S. paper.  For example, Spain would 
support banning the landing of passengers from boats 
containing 400 or more passengers (compared to 500 or more in 
the U.S. proposal).  Spain would also support making this ban 
binding (vice non-binding as in the U.S proposal). 
 
¶3.  Martinez-Cattaneo also said that Spain believes that the 
ATCM should consider tailoring the passenger landing ban to 
different Antarctic ecosystems.  While some areas might be 
able to support larger landings, there were other areas being 
visited that clearly require even more stringent restrictions 
on the number of people allowed to land at any given time. 
Spain believes that a one-size-fits-all approach does not 
make sense.
