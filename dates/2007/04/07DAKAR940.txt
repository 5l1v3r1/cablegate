¶1.  Eighty Senegalese peacekeepers who have been serving as civilian 
police (CIVPOL) in Haiti returned last week.  With Senegal 
benefiting from the African Contingency Operations Training and 
Assistance (ACOTA) and Centers of Excellence for Stability Police 
Units (COESPU) programs, the Mission has endeavored for some time to 
obtain a more exact picture of Senegal's peacekeeping deployments. 
Based upon input provided to the Office of Defense Cooperation, the 
Defense Attache and the Regional Security Office, Embassy 
understands that as of April 15, 2007, Senegal had a total of 2,681 
peacekeepers deployed abroad. 
 
¶2.  The country breakdown follows: 
 
-- Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) -- 727 
   (470 soldiers, 252 gendarmes and 5 prison guards) 
-- Cote d'Ivoire -- 674 
   (515 soldiers, 92 gendarmes, 60 police and 7 prison   guards) 
-- East Timor - 18 
   (14 police and 4 gendarmes) 
-- Haiti -- 141 
   (119 gendarmes, 20 police and 2 prison guards) 
-- Liberia -- 585 
   (465 soldiers and 120 gendarmes) 
-- Sudan -- 536 
   (465 soldiers, 46 police and 25 gendarmes) 
 
¶3.  If one examines the breakdown by service, the army currently has 
1,915 peacekeepers abroad; the police have contributed 140 policemen 
to CivPol; the gendarmes have 612 men involved in CivPol; and the 
penitentiary service has 14 men abroad as CivPol. 
 
¶4.  COMMENT:  Some of the 766 CivPol may have benefited from COESPU 
or Anti-Terrorism Assistance (ATA) training, and all of the deployed 
soldiers have benefited from ACOTA.  However, the Senegalese 
continue to request that we examine ways to provide appropriate 
training to all personnel deployed in United Nations and African 
Union security operations.  END COMMENT.
