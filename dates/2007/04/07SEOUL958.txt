SUBJECT: INITIAL ROK RESPONSE TO REQUEST FOR NSG COUNTRIES 
TO PERMIT SHARING OF EXPORT DENIAL INFORMATION WITH THE 
IAEA AND IAEA MEMBER STATES 
 
REF: STATE 39585 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see para 3. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On March 30, Poloff delivered reftel demarche to 
Youn Jong-kwon, Deputy Director of the Disarmament and 
Nonproliferation Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
and Trade (MOFAT).  In a follow-up conversation, Youn said 
that the ROKG supports the general idea of sharing 
information regarding export denials to Iran.  Youn requested 
clarification about the point in the non-paper that the 
information would be shared with non-Nuclear Suppliers Group 
(NSG) countries.  Youn said that he did not foresee any 
problems with the ROKG sharing the information with the IAEA 
and the UN Security Council, but needed to know which non-NSG 
countries would also receive the information. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Action Request: Post requests that Department 
provide a response to Youn's request for the list of 
countries the Iran denial information will be shared with. 
End Action Request.
