The Honorable John Heffern

Embassy of the United States of America

Jakarta 10110 
 
Dear Deputy Ambassador: 
 
I am pleased to inform you that between April 15-18, 2007, I 
plan to visit Washington DC to follow up and consolidate 
agreement between our two governments in enhancing 
cooperative activities in the field of defense, I leave 
Washington DC 18 April for Rome, Italy. 
 
The focus of my visit will be to explain the defense and 
military reforms in the light of the lifting of restrictions 
on military equipment from the United States to the defense 
force of Indonesia, more specifically the reform of the 
Indonesia Special Forces (Kopassus). 
 
I will also explain to commitment of the Defense Force to 
support graduated political and economic democratization as 
our government plans to emphasize equitable growth, 
employment generation and reduce poverty. 
 
Between 16-17 April I would hope to be able to meet with 
Defense Secretary Robert Gates, and possibly with Secretary 
of State Condoleezza Rice, as well as selected members of the 
US Senate and House of Representatives. 
 
Please accept, Deputy Ambassador, the assurances of my 
highest consideration. 
 
Sincerely, 
Juwono Sudarsono 
Minister of Denfese 
 
End Note 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Given the short time frame of the proposed visit,

notably on the request for meetings with the Secretaries of 
Defense and State.
