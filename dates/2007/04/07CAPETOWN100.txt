SUBJECT: SOUTH AFRICA PLANS AIRPORT EXPANSION FOR 2010 
WORLD CUP 
 
REF: DURBAN 00001 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary.  Airport Companies South Africa (ACSA) 
will expand airport capacity by 40% over the next five 
years to meet rising demand and accommodate 2010 Soccer 
World Cup passengers.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Embassy transportation officer attending the 
annual Board of Airlines Representatives South Africa 
(BARSA) annual conference held near Cape Town 23-25 March 
learned that ACSA is expanding capacity at major airports 
in Durban, Cape Town and Johannesburg from 33 million 
passengers/year to 45 million by 2012 (40% increase) 
through a R5.2 billion ($743 million) capital expansion 
plan, according to ACSA's Andre ver Meulen.  Ver Meulen 
said that even with these expansions, the major airports 
would not be able to handle the surge in demand expected 
from 2010 World Soccer Cup travelers, requiring the 
increased use of secondary airports on a temporary basis. 
 
¶3. (SBU) OR Tambo International Airport (formerly 
Johannesburg International Airport), South Africa's busiest 
airport, will open a new international pier June 1 and a 
new central terminal building by the end of 2008.  Cape 
Town International Airport, also in the midst of major 
reconstruction, expects annual passenger volume to rise 
from the current 7.4 million to 10.3 million by 2010 and 14 
million by 2014.  Durban International Airport will expand 
capacity from current 4.1 million to 7.5 million by 2015. 
A new international airport, LaMercy north of Durban, will 
add 7.5 million in capacity but construction has been 
delayed due to a lawsuit filed by an unsuccessful 
construction bidder.  Once completed, La Mercy is intended 
to eventually replace the Durban International Airport as 
the principal airport for the Kwazulunatal Province 
(reftel). 
 
¶4. (SBU) According to ACSA Managing Director Monhla Hlahla, 
R132 million of the R5.2 billion will be spent to upgrade 
secondary airports operated by ACSA to handle 2010 world 
cup passengers.  These airports are located in Port 
Elizabeth, East London, George, Bloemfontein, Kimberly, 
Uppington and Pilanesberg.
