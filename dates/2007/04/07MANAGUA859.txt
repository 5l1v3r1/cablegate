SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR RAISES UNSCR 1747, DESIGNATION OF 
IRAN,S DEFENSE INDUSTRIES WITH FOREIGN MINISTER SANTOS 
 
REF: A. SECSTATE 40909 
 
     ¶B. MANAGUA 0797 
     ¶C. SECSTATE 37801 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli.  Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
¶1.  (C) On April 2, the Ambassador raised the USG's 
designation of Iran's Defense Industries Organization (DIO) 
under E.O. 13382 with Foreign Minister Santos.  He also 
reiterated the importance of the international community's 
adhering to UNSCR 1747 and urged the Nicaraguan government 
(GON) to ensure it does not support the activities of any of 
the Iranian companies, entities, or individuals listed in the 
UNSCR 1747's annex. 
 
¶2.  (C) The Ambassador voiced concern that President Ortega's 
recent public statements could be interpreted as support for 
Iran's defiance of the United Nations.  He clarified that the 
UN resolutions regarding Iran do not reflect a conflict 
between the United States and Iran, nor opposition to Iran's 
developing nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.  Rather, the 
world rejects Iran's efforts to develop nuclear weapons and 
refusal to agree to inspections. 
 
¶3.  (C) Foreign Minister Santos assured the Ambassador he 
will raise the matter with President Ortega and other GON 
officials following the Easter break.  (Comment: President 
Ortega is likely subject to considerable pressure from his 
Venezuelan counterpart and ally to openly defy the UNSC 
resolutions on Iran.  While the GON will probably avoid going 
to this extreme, we also do not expect it to fully implement 
the terms of the resolutions.  More likely, the GON will 
attempt to avoid dealing with the matter.)
