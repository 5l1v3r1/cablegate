¶1.  (U) Summary: An Indonesian Air Force (IAF) representative 
confirmed on February 6 that the IAF placed an order for reftel 
goods with the Singaporean firm Litebub Technologies (LT), through a 
local Indonesian IAF supplier.  The representative also confirmed 
that the IAF expects to receive the goods directly from Litebub. 
End summary. 
 
¶2.  We contacted Indonesian Air Force Weapon and Ammunition Division 
Lieutenant Colonel Mehtesa Tarigan on February 6 to verify reftel 
transaction.  Tarigan confirmed that his office is familiar with LT 
as an IAF supplier.  He stated that the IAF placed an order for 
items detailed in reftel with LT in November 2006, through the 
Indonesian company PT Surya Chandra, which acts as a parts purchaser 
on behalf of the IAF. 
 
¶3.  We also contacted Surya Chandra Director Mr. Halim Perdana 
Kusuma on February 7 to verify the transaction.  Kusuma confirmed 
that his company received a contract from the IAF in November 2006 
to procure items detailed in reftel and that PT. Surya Chandra 
ordered the goods through LT. The IAF confirmed that PT. Surya 
Chandra is a registered IAF supplier located at Plaza Central, 3/F, 
Jl. Jend.Sudirman No.47, Jakarta, tel: +62 21 525 5608, fax: +62 21 
525 6886. 
 
¶4.  According to Tarigan, there are no outstanding contracts with 
Litebub from his division.  However, he could not confirm whether 
that is true for other IAF divisions.  Tarigan also informed us that 
the IAF will receive the F-16 aircraft spare parts detailed in 
reftel directly from Litebub Technologies.  He added that an IAF 
vehicle will stand by at Jakarta Soekarno-Hatta airport to secure 
 
delivery of goods once LT sends confirmation of air shipment.
