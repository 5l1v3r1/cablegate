SUBJECT: SEA CHANGE AT SOUDA BAY: NEW LOCAL POLITICIANS 
SEEK BETTER RELATIONS 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: During a March 22 visit to Crete to attend 
the retirement ceremony for departing Captain Sale, 
Ambassador met local mayors and the new nomarch (governor) of 
Chania.  The positive reception Ambassador received was 
markedly different from his very frosty meetings with the old 
leftist leadership and augured well for good cooperation 
between the local communities and Souda Bay NSA.  The new 
local politicians stressed their desire for more USN ship 
visits and promised to do what they could to resolve 
outstanding issues, such as the stalled Marathi fuel 
pipeline.  END SUMMARY. 
 
SEA CHANGES AT SOUDA BAY 
------------------------ 
 
¶2. (SBU) On March 22, Ambassador traveled to Crete to deliver 
the keynote address at the retirement ceremony for Souda Bay 
Naval Support Activity (NSA) commander Captain Steven Sale. 
Ambassador also paid calls on several local politicians with 
whom Souda NSA deals on a regular basis, including Governor 
(Nomarch) of Chania Grigoris Archondakis, Mayor of Chania 
Kiriakos Virvidakis, and Mayor of Akrotiri Mikalis Kynigos. 
Virvidakis had previously served as mayor and was re-elected 
in the October 2006 local elections.  Archondakis and Kynigos 
are new to their positions.  All three are members of New 
Democracy. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Overall, the meetings focused on the need for good 
relations and cooperation.  Such discussions in another 
context would be unremarkable but in the case of Souda Bay 
represented a radical change from the situation that had 
prevailed for the last several years.  Previously, local 
leftist politicians were openly hostile to Souda Bay NSA and 
had little interest in visits by USN ships, despite the 
substantial financial benefits local communities reap from 
port calls.  The tenor of the Ambassador,s meetings with the 
new local leadership, in contrast, augured well for 
cooperation and good relations.  Indeed, the new atmosphere 
was evident from the start of the day, when the governor and 
two mayors attended the retirement ceremony -- the first time 
in memory that local Cretan politicians had attended an 
official function at Souda Bay NSA. 
 
GOVERNOR PLEADS FOR SHIP VISITS 
------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Chania Governor Archondakis, owner of a small local 
pharmacy chain, as well as a resort hotel that caters to 
handicapped customers, told Ambassador a "radical change" had 
taken place in local politics.  One of his top priorities was 
to strengthen ties between the Chania community and the U.S. 
Naval base.  That would not only bring economic benefits but 
would also demonstrate the changed political atmosphere. 
Ambassador underscored the desire of Souda Bay NSA and the 
Embassy to increase the number of port calls by USN ships, 
explaining that fewer ships had visited recently because of 
the increased tempo of USN operations in the Persian Gulf and 
elsewhere.  These operations left little time for shore leave 
and goodwill visits, though Ambassador expected that 
situation to change in the near future. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Ambassador also noted the impact of the black-dye 
fuel issue.  (NOTE: GoG regulations require tax-exempt fuel 
sold on local markets to international buyers to contain 
black dye as a safeguard against re-sale, but USN rules 
require purchasing only "clear and bright" fuel.  Many USN 
ships, thus, have taken their business to other countries. 
END NOTE.)  Another important issue was the construction of a 
new fuel pipeline from the Marathi piers to the Souda Bay air 
station.  The governor understood both issues well and 
promised to do what he could to get them solved.  He had 
already spoken to the mayor of Akrotiri, where the dig 
permits for the pipeline must be issued, and believed he was 
favorably disposed. 
 
OLD HAND IN CHANIA 
------------------ 
 
¶6. (SBU) Mayor of Chania Virvidakis -- a physician and a 
cousin of FM Dora Bakoyannis -- already demonstrated goodwill 
toward Souda Bay NSA during his first term but was equally 
focused on getting more ships, both military and tourist, to 
visit.  The mayor had two projects in the works to make 
Chania more attractive: an infrastructure renewal focused on 
 
ATHENS 00000625  002 OF 002 
 
 
repairing roads and planting more trees, and a cultural 
renewal focused on repairing monuments and building museums 
and other cultural attractions.  In response to the mayor,s 
plans to establish a Mediterranean architectural center, the 
Ambassador offered to invite his brother-in-law, a professor 
of architecture at the University of Hawaii specializing in 
energy efficient designs, to address one of the center,s 
conferences.  With the mayor, Ambassador also noted the 
negative impact of the fuel-dye issue on USN ship visits. 
 
A GREENHORN, BUT SAVVY 
---------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Akrotiri mayor Kynigos noted a somewhat 
anti-American climate in Crete but argued that it was no 
worse than elsewhere in Greece.  He also argued that it was 
directed not at Americans, but at American foreign policy. 
He added, however, that his job was not foreign policy but 
the well-being of Akrotiri.  He said he had already met 
Captains Sale and McDonough and looked forward to good 
relations.  He lobbied for locals getting more jobs at Souda 
Bay NSA, which would help improve their attitude towards the 
base, and suggested the base make an effort to buy more local 
agricultural products for provisioning ships. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Ambassador thanked the mayor for attending the 
retirement ceremony, noted the desire of the Embassy and 
Souda Bay NSA to increase the base,s economic benefits to 
the community -- particularly through more ship visits -- and 
asked the mayor for his help with approval of the fuel 
pipeline, which was not only necessary but also a gesture of 
good will.  The mayor responded that he had been in office 
only two months and such things took time.  Nevertheless, the 
mayor said he would do what he could to help. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) Embassy Athens is sorry to see Captain Sale retire. 
Steve has done an excellent job in reaching out to the local 
communities on Crete, in addition to managing Souda Bay NSA 
very well.  He is a first-rate diplomat.  We look forward to 
working with his successor, Captain McDonough, who intends to 
continue Captain Sale,s outreach efforts.  Embassy will do 
everything it can to support him and Team Souda.
