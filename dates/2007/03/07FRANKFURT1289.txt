¶1. (SBU) Consulate Pol-Econ officer visited Roeder Praezision, 
located in Egelsbach (near Frankfurt) on March 1 to conduct a Blue 
Lantern post-shipment verification check for licenses 05-982891 and 
05-984718.  P-E officer met at length with General Manager Oliver 
Baer and Defense/Public Contracts Manager Manfred Becker, touring 
the facility including storage/factory areas.  Roeder is a 
long-standing contractor for the German Airforce (Luftwaffe), 
importing F-4 parts for use in assembling and overhauling aircraft 
brakes and landing gear.  In addition, the Embassy obtained a copy 
of the relevant purchase orders from the German Airforce.  NOTE: the 
German Airforce is phasing out the F-4 Phantom, so these may be 
Roeder's final orders of this kind.  END NOTE. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In business since 1922, Roeder is a mid-sized stock company 
whose shares are closely held by the Roeder family.  In addition to 
its work for the German Airforce, Roeder provides service and sales 
for small aircraft (as the largest Cessna dealer in Europe) and to 
commercial airliners (parts only).  Roeder frequently encounters 
export control restrictions in its civilian aircraft business (for 
instance, prohibitions on re-exporting Boeing parts to Iran). 
Roeder also operates a German Airforce parts depot on its site 
("Bundeseigenelager") but that depot is separate from Roeder's other 
business (and was not used for these orders). 
 
¶3. (SBU) Becker confirmed that the two F-4 brake part orders had 
arrived and were currently in use at Roeder (for ongoing 
assembly/service to German Airforce aircraft).  Roeder has a 
long-standing partnership with Yonir (the US exporter) and is 
familiar with U.S. export control regulations.  Roeder makes end-use 
certifications but relies on Yonir to secure the relevant export 
licenses.  The relevant parts are generally delivered via UPS and 
come into Roeder's storehouse, but later spend considerable time on 
the factory floor.  NOTE:  Roeder has a proprietary method for 
re-building F-4 brakes to German Airforce specifications, requiring 
extensive processing. 
 
¶4. (SBU) P-E Officer toured Roeder's facilities and confirmed that 
parts are kept under generally secure circumstances:  vehicle and 
personnel access to the compound is controlled via contract guards, 
and warehouse access is controlled.  Roeder does not protect its F-4 
brake assembly area separately from its other factory floor/overall 
security arrangements.  Roeder officials showed ongoing construction 
in its security facilities (the new factory entrance had been opened 
a month earlier) and expressed that it is upgrading overall 
security. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Roeder management said they would appreciate simplified 
access to U.S. control lists and that much of their information 
comes from German's export control authority (BAFA).  P-E Officer 
gave Roeder a copy of DTCC's model compliance program for exporters 
as an example of improving overall capabilities in this area. 
 
¶6.  This message was coordinated with Embassy Berlin.
