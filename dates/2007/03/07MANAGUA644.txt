The Draft Contract 
------------------ 

¶3. (SBU) The contract consists of thirty-three clauses 
addressing Nicaraocoop's sale of 1.250 MT of red beans to La 
CASA at agreed upon terms, including price, quality, 
inspection requirements, delivery, freight charges, and other 
contract clauses.  The stated price in the draft contract is 
$760 per metric ton, but this conflicts with the price placed 
in parenthesis, i.e., $1081 per metric ton.  The latter 
almost corresponds to the total amount written into the draft 
contract, i.e., $1,350,375, which the draft contract states 
is equivalent to BS2,903,306,250 (Note: this figure conflicts 
with the figure placed in parentheses (BS 2,786,400,000)). 
No annexes mentioned in the draft contract were attached. 
The contract expires 6 months from the date of signature.
