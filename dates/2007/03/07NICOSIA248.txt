¶1. Post on March 1 delivered Iran-related talking points and 
information as specified in reftels, then followed up several 
times with MFA interlocutors.  Near East/Africa Affairs 
Attache Dionysis Dionysiou finally responded March 21, noting 
that Cyprus would give our points fullest consideration. 
Dionysiou added that Multilateral Affairs Director Marios 
Kountourides was attending Iran sanctions-related meetings in 
Brussels that very day.  Dionysiou further committed to 
seeking a substantive readout upon the division director's 
return, and promised to stay in touch with the Embassy 
regarding the issue.
