POLITICAL 
 
EKSPRES / SABAH (GUNEY) / BOLGE / EVRENSEL / ZAMAN / RADIKAL: 
Kahramanmaras Governor Ilhan Atis, who has been assigned to the 
governor's position in Adana through a decree that reshuffled 
governors, said, 'if my new position in Adana is being seen as a 
promotion, that I should have earned through working with the 
courage that Kahramanmaras people instituted me with. My 
happiness is only because I am not going to a far away place.' 
Adana Governor Cahit Kirac has been assigned as the new Izmir 
Governor.  Former Izmir Governor has been assigned as the 
National Security Director. 
 
GUNDEM: Sezgin Tanrikulu, Chairperson of Diyarbakir Bar 
Association, said that authorities must open the doors of the 
Imrali Prison, where Abdullah Ocalan is being kept, to an 
independent commission of doctors.  DTP welcomed the decision of 
the government to send three doctors to Imrali to take samples 
from Ocalan, but regarded Justice Minister's remarks that 
allegations about the poisoning of Ocalan would be soon refuted 
as unfortunate since those remarks were exerting pressure on the 
three-doctor delegation. 300 people, including members of 
several civil society associations, unions and DTP members 
gathered in Tunceli to hold a press announcement upon remarks 
made by Justice Minister about the health condition of Abdullah 
Ocalan (see press summary for March 6).  Thousands of women are 
reportedly continuing their March 8 Women's Day activities in 
Sirnak and the women are reportedly pointing out the health 
condition of Ocalan.  The daily reports some people as hurling 
Molotov cocktails at non-passenger train cars in Mersin and 
Istanbul and causing small fires and material damage, to protest 
the alleged poisoning of Ocalan.

taken from Ocalan were sent to Istanbul Forensic Authority for 
further examination.

Turk, National Chirperson of DTP, to six months in prison for

Â¶2006. 
 
GUNDEM: Subgovernor's Office in Sanliurfa's Halfeti district 
overturned the application of the local newroz committee 
requesting authorization to conduct local celebrations on 
grounds that the application document included a non-Turkish

of Halfeti said that they changed the text of the document and 
reapplied to hold celebrations in the district.

in Turkey soared in 2006 and the streets of big cities have

are not reporting crimes because of their distrust of the 
police.

environment.
