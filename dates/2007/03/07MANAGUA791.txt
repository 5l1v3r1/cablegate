SUBJECT: ORTEGA DESIRES CONSTRUCTIVE RELATIONS WITH THE 
USG, BUT SOME HARDLINERS OBJECT, CLAIMS AMBASSADOR ENRIQUEZ 
(C-AL7-00063) 
 
REF: A. MANAGUA 0789 
     ¶B. MANAGUA 0701 
     ¶C. MANAGUA 0631 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli.  Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
¶1.  (C) Summary: Ambassador Magda Enriquez, the Director of 
the MFA's Multilateral Affairs Office, believes President 
Ortega sincerely desires constructive relations with the 
United States, but she concedes that some Sandinista party 
hardliners object.  While she acknowledges that Ortega 
considers President Chavez his "friend and ally," she insists 
that Ortega does not see eye to eye with him on all issues. 
She notes that the GON has differed with Iran's efforts to 
deny the Holocaust -- deciding instead to support the recent 
UN Holocaust statement.  Enriquez is convinced that the 
Iranian government is besieged by serious domestic troubles 
and would probably be willing to settle its impasse with the 
UN Security Council regarding its nuclear objectives if a 
"face-saving" approach were offered, and offers Nicaragua's 
help to this end.  Enriquez also claims that Nicaragua will 
not bow to China's demand that it sever its diplomatic ties 
with Taiwan.  End Summary. 
 
Ortega Rhetoric Hinders Constructive Relations

¶2.  (C) On March 24, Ambassador Magda Enriquez, the Director 
of the Foreign Ministry's (MFA) Multilateral Affairs Office 
discussed with PolCouns and TDY analysts the Nicaraguan 
government's (GON) views on the U.S.-Nicaragua bilateral 
relationship and its multilateral priorities.  She started 
off by reiterating her position that President Ortega 
sincerely desires constructive relations with the United 
States, as evidenced by the appointment of an independent 
Ambassador to Washington and by Foreign Minister Samuel 
Santos' efforts to maintain open channels with the U.S. 
Embassy in Managua.  She conceded, however, that "some party 
hardliners object."  While Enriquez also acknowledged that 
Ortega considers Venezuelan President Chavez his "friend and 
ally," she insisted that Ortega does not see eye to eye with 
Chavez on all issues and that her government will not be 
pressured by any other to take a position it does not 
support. 
 
¶3.  (C) When PolCouns raised our concerns that President 
Ortega's discourse regarding the United States has become 
increasingly belligerent and unconstructive, Enriquez nodded. 
 She then recounted how she listened to Ortega's speech while 
she was driving home and counted 21 negative references to 
the United States.  She immediately called an equally 
dismayed Santos, who had tallied 22 slights to the United 
States.  Enriquez explained that she sent a note to Ortega 
concerning the incident, who responded that his intention was 
not to criticize the current U.S. government but, rather, the 
Reagan administration.  PolCouns mentioned that during the 
transition period Foreign Minister Santos had recommended we 
minimize bilateral friction by removing our differences from 
the media spotlight -- an approach we support and have 
followed.  Enriquez promised to urge her government to do 
likewise. 
 
Nicaragua Differs with Iran on the Holocaust, Offers to Help 
Broker Nuclear Impasse

¶4.  (C) Expanding on the subject of the GON's decision to 
develop a "sovereign foreign policy," Enriquez cited that 
fact that her government differed with Iran over the 
Holocaust, and instead, supported the recent UN Holocaust 
statement.  Enriquez also confided that the Iranian 
government is besieged by serious domestic troubles and it 
would probably be willing to settle its impasse with the UN 
Security Council regarding its nuclear objectives if a 
"face-saving" approach were offered.  Opining that perhaps 
North Korea could serve as a model, she reiterated 
Nicaragua's interest in helping advance this effort (Ref. C). 
 
 
Relationship with Taiwan will Continue

¶5.  (C) Commenting that the Chinese government is increasing 
its pressure on Nicaragua to severe its ties with Taiwan as a 
pre-condition to establish full-fledged diplomatic relations 
and to benefit from Chinese assistance, Enriquez was adamant 
that her government Nicaragua will not bow to this demand. 
She explained that the GON policy is to cooperate with both 
countries and to benefit from what they have to offer. 
 
Rapprochement with Iraq

¶6.  (C) Enriquez, who met last week with Iraqi Ambassador to 
the United Nations, Hamid Al-Biyati, was pleased with this 
first step towards rapprochement (Ref. A).  She agreed that a 
next step could be a meeting between Foreign Minister Santos 
and his Iraqi counterpart.  However, Enriquez reminded us 
that Nicaragua cannot afford to stand up, let alone, maintain 
an embassy in Baghdad. 
 
Seeking our Views on UN Reform and Human Rights Commission

¶7.  (C) Enriquez requested additional details on the U.S. 
position on UN reform and our concerns regarding the UN Human 
Rights Council.  PolCouns offered to send materials and 
suggested that during her next trip to the United States, 
Enriquez could meet with the offices that cover these issues. 
 She clarified that Nicaragua's newly appointed UN 
Ambassador, Manuel Diaz Lacayo, will eventually take the lead 
on this matter.  However, ongoing heart trouble will delay 
his arrival date in New York, explained Enriquez.  (Note: The 
demarche on UN reform (Ref. B) was delivered while Enriquez 
was out of country.) 
 
Bio 
- - - 
 
¶8.  (C) Dr. Magda Enriquez Callejas-Beitler was born in 
Chinandega, Nicaragua of a prosperous family who sent her to 
the study Journalism at Temple University in the mid-1960s. 
She tells us that her parents sent her abroad to remove her 
from Nicaragua's political tensions, but ironically, she cut 
her "political teeth" in the United States on its social 
turmoil and anti-Vietnam sentiment.  Following the Sandinista 
victory in 1979, Enriquez returned to Nicaragua where she 
assumed a number of positions with the FSLN, including the 
MFA's director of Middle East and Asia Policy.  She also 
frequently interpreted for Daniel Ortega.  After Violeta 
Chamorro's victory, Enriquez returned to Philadelphia and 
represented the FSLN in the United States and Canada.  She 
received a PhD in education from Temple University, worked 
for years in the Philadelphia school system, and also taught 
Bilingual and Bicultural Studies at La Salle University. 
Enriquez has been married twice, both times to Jewish 
Americans, and claims that 
 after she introduced Ortega to then-Israeli PM Shimon Perez, 
Ortega's views on Israel became "more moderate."  She is the 
mother of four children, all U.S. citizens. 
 
Comment

¶9.  (C) Along with her boss Santos, Enriquez appears to be 
aligned with the FSLN moderates, recognizes the value of 
positive engagement with the United States, and probably 
lends a voice of reason to balance the more extreme views of 
the Sandinista hardliners like Lenin Cerna and Miguel 
D'Escoto.  How much sway she actually holds over Ortega is 
questionable, however.
