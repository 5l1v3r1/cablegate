¶1.  (U)  Sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect 
accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Post's responses are keyed to questions in Reftel A. 
 This is part 3 of 3 (septels).

Protection and Assistance to Victims 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶A.  (U)  The GOT assists victims by providing shelter and 
access to legal, medical and psychological services.  Since 
2004, the GoT has issued 35 humanitarian visas to allow 
victims to remain in the country for rehabilitation, medical 
care, and legal assistance.  The humanitarian visas carry a 
six-month residence permit and the option to extend for one 
additional month.  Most victims, however, chose to return to 
their country of origin.  With or without a humanitarian 
visa, identified victims were not required to pay normal 
departure fees or fines and the GoT did not take steps to bar 
re-entry to Turkey. 
 
Foreign women detained for illegal sex work are routinely 
screened for sexually-transmitted diseases.  Victims of 
trafficking, however, are given the choice to seek free 
psychological and medical care, coordinated by Human 
Resources Development Foundation (HRDF), Foreign Womens 
Solidarity (FWS) and/organization Migration 
(IO they are referred to tdlter, vPVOTs through 
Ankara shelter, run Qssisted 98 VOTs 
since )in October 2005. 
 
¶B.  (U)  The Istabul municipality directly finances rent forQ 
the Istanbul shelter.  The Ankara municipality completely 
refurbished and furnished (from all new appliances, to 
computers, to bed linens) two townhouses for use as the 
Ankara shelter.  The municipality continues to supply heating 
and water, as well as internet and cable TV hookup. 
 
HRDF was allocated 150,000 YTL in October 2005 from the Prime 
Ministry Social Solidarity Fund (the "Fund") to help cover 
the Istanbul shelter expenses and is close to signing a 
contract to receive follow-on money from the Fund through the 
end of 2007.  FWS was allocated 75,000 YTL from the Fund to 
help cover the Ankara shelter expenses. 
 
¶C.  (U)  There is a screening and referral process in place 
to transfer victims to NGO shelters in Istanbul and Ankara. 
According to IOM, the screening and referral process works 
well for identified VOTs. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
provided (and IOM confirmed) the following details on how the 
process works: 
 
- in the province where the crime is committed, the 
Foreigners Police, accompanied by a lawyer and a 
psychologist, conduct an initial interview and pass the 
information to the Security Directorate General Foreigners, 
Border, Asylum Department Head's office; 
- A decision is made in coordination with IOM and transfer 
procedures to move the potential victim are conducted; 
- A joint interview of the potential victim is conducted by 
the expert police liaisons to the Ankara and Istanbul 
shelters and representatives from IOM and HRDF (if near 
Istanbul) or WSF (if near Ankara); 
- After a determination is made that the potential victims is 
a victim of human trafficking, the victim is placed at a 
shelter. 
 
¶D.  (U)  The rights of VOTs are respected once they are 
identified as victims. 
 
¶E.  (U)  Humanitarian visas, residency permits, and the two 
shelters for VOTs have allowed victims to seek legal 
services.  VOTs are encouraged to assist in the investigation 
and prosecution of trafficking on a strictly voluntary basis. 
 Victims have begun to cooperate with police to institute 
action against their traffickers. 
 
There are provisions in the new Turkish Penal Code for victim 
restitution in civil court.  To date, no VOT has filed such a 
suit. 
 
There is no impediment to VOT access to legal redress. 
 
¶F.  (U)  We have no evidence that the GoT provides protection 
beyond the Istanbul and Ankara shelters, to victims or 
witnesses of any crimes, including trafficking in persons. 
Once a VOT is placed in a shelter, the victim is part of an 
international referral mechanism for rehabilitation and 
reintegration.  Vocational training is available through this 
mechanism in source countries.  FWS offers computer courses 
to victims at the Ankara shelter who express interest. 
 
Statistics show that the majority of the victims are between 
the ages of 18-24; there are few identified VOTs under the 
age of 18.  To date underage identified victims are placed in 
one of the two shelters; there are no separate foster-care or 
juvenile justice detention centers for victims of trafficking. 
 
¶G.  (SBU)  See para G in Investigation and Prosecution 
section.  We have no evidence there is any training on the 
special needs of trafficked children, though the Public Order 
Department gives limited training on child pornography.  All 
Turkish embassies and consulates in source countries 
distribute passport inserts and information regarding the 157 
victim hotline and counter-trafficking measures in Turkey. 
 
¶H.  (U)  We have no evidence that Turkey qualifies as a 
significant source country.  The GoT, however, provides 
assistance (medical aid, shelter and financial help) to 
internally trafficked victims. 
 
¶I.  (U)  The IOM works with trafficking victims in Turkey and 
in the majority of source countries.  Through partnerships 
with IOM and the GoT, the HRDF and FWS coordinate shelter, 
medical services, psychological and legal counseling, and 
repatriation services in both Turkey and the source country. 
IOM, HRDF and FWS continue to laud the cooperation and 
support they receive from the GoT, particularly from law 
enforcement.
