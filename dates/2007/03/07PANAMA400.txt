RUEABND/DEA HQS WASHDC¶3.  (SBU) In the first half of March there have been several 
negotiating sessions between the GOP (Office of the President and 
the National Security Council, or Consejo) and Gomez over the PTJ. 
While as recently as mid-February Gomez indicated privately to us 
that the PTJ would be placed squarely under her office, the 
Executive appears to have turned the tables.  The GOP appears set to 
effectively dismantle the PTJ and place virtually all of its 
functions into a sub-direction  of the National Police (PNP), an arm 
of the Executive.  (Note:  Such a move would require approval of 
Congress.  The GOP counts on a sizeable majority in the institution. 
 End Note.)  Gomez admitted as much to the Ambassador on March 14, 
lamenting that she would likely only maintain a small group of 
forensic and medical investigators under her stewardship.  We 
understand a sort of deal was struck that will allow the AG to 
exercise day-to-day control over the PNP sub-direction and pick its 
head. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) We have worked very well with Gomez, who is strongly 
pro-U.S. and firm in her determination to go after major criminals. 
Internal communication and organizational skills are not her 
prowess, however.  Over the past months, we had worked discretely to 
advocate keeping the PTJ relatively intact and firmly under her 
direction, estimating that such a framework would best serve our law 
enforcement interests.  While a move by the Executive to place most 
of the PTJ under the PNP would not necessarily be problematic for 
our law enforcement interests, it remains to be seen whether the 
Executive will adopt a structure that maintains much needed checks 
and balances on the Executive Branch.  Our message will continue to 
focus on the importance of investigative and prosecutorial results. 
We will continue to follow the issue closely and report any 
additional developments.
