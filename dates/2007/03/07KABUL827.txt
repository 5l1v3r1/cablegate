Ref: Kabul 582 
 
¶1. The avian influenza outbreak in Jalalabad late last month 
(reftel) has spread to a total of six districts in three provinces. 
Confirmed cases of H5N1 in backyard poultry have now been reported 
in Nangarhar (3 districts), Kunar (2 districts), and Kabul (1 
district) provinces.  The pattern of spread so far is following that 
of last year's outbreak: an initial outbreak in Nangarhar which then 
spread in all directions.  Last year, a secondary spread radiating 
outward from Kabul followed the initial spread. 
 
¶2. The GoA has taken immediate action at each outbreak site, 
including disinfection, culling, and quarantine of the affected 
areas.  A poultry vaccination program is underway, as is a public 
information campaign and intensified testing.  As of 8 March, in 
Nangarhar province 232 premises had been inspected and disinfected, 
581 domestic poultry had been destroyed at a cost (indemnification) 
of $2,948 USD, and nearly 35,000 breeding stock and layers had been 
vaccinated.  In Kunar province, 220 premises had been inspected and 
disinfected, 1,127 domestic poultry had been destroyed at a cost 
(indemnification) of $2,139 USD, and nearly 5,500 breeding stock and 
layers had been vaccinated.  No action had been taken by the GOA in 
Kabul province--the most recently discovered outbreak area--as of 8 
March. 
 
¶3. In-country diagnosis at the Central Veterinary Diagnostic and 
Research Laboratories in Kabul (supported by FAO and the U.S. Navy) 
is proving to be a key ingredient in GoA response, as is the 
improved flow of information within the GoA and to the general 
public.  Funding for the initial response, indemnification and 
vaccine is through USDA PL-480 support.  Long-term support will be 
through the World Bank.  USAID and DoD have provided ample personal 
protective equipment.  UNICEF is providing the lead for 
communication efforts throughout the country.  A stepped-up human 
surveillance program is producing results as well: 25 suspected 
human cases have been submitted for diagnosis, and all have proven 
not to be influenza. 
 
¶4. In response to the initial spread beyond Jalalabad, Embassy 
issued a warden message to U.S. citizens on March 3, describing the 
extent of the outbreaks and appropriate health precautions.  Further 
warden messages will follow as the situation develops.  In response 
to the discovery of H5N1 in Kabul, Embassy is preparing a staff 
announcement with information on the outbreak and precautionary 
measures.
