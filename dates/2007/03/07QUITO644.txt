REF: STATE 031831 
 
Â¶1.  (SBU) PolOff delivered the points in reftel on UN reform 
and the internal administration of justice to MFA Director 
General for Multilateral Affairs Lourdes Puma on March 15. 
Puma noted she was preparing instructions for New York and 
thanked us for the information.  She agreed that it appeared 
many delegations, including Ecuador, were not examining the 
reforms on internal administration of justice closely, but 
would not speculate on a final GOE position.
