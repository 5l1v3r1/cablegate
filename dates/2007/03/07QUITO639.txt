SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR JEWELL MEETS ECUADOR,S NEW TRANSPORT 
MINISTER 
 
 
 ¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  On March 13, the Ambassador paid an 
introductory call on Trajano Andrade, Minister of 
Transportation.  Andrade explained the GOE's strategic vision 
for the ministry, stressing that ground transport and port 
management are priorities.  He said the Ministry wanted to 
fight corruption and to serve as a positive, impartial force 
that would rebuild the country's transport infrastructure. 
Notably, he added that he believed that the private sector 
should be an ally of the government, in contrast to "the 
situation in Venezuela."  End summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On March 13, the Ambassador met with Minister of 
Transport Trajano Andrade.  Andrade explained that with the 
formation of the new administration, the Ministry of 
Transport had been divided into four under secretariats: 
ground transport (including public transit and the railroad 
system), maritime transport and port management, air 
transport, and public works (a type of policy under 
secretariat that will guide the tasks of the other three). 
 
SIPDIS 
Each of these would contribute to a single national transport 
plan, which would be set forth in a national transportation 
law.  The GOE has asked the embassies of Chile and Spain for 
technical assistance to help develop this transport plan. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) A top priority for the national transport plan is 
the highway system.  Andrade said that Ecuador's highways 
were destroyed, and described corruption in the construction 
sector as untenable.  He noted the MOT's plans to lower costs 
by contracting with the Ecuadorian Army Corps of Engineers, 
and by using existing equipment rather than buying new. 
Likewise, instead of building new highways, the Ministry 
plans to repair existing roads and finish ongoing projects. 
He added that the Ministry is seeking ways to work with 
contractors to fight corruption. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) When the Ambassador mentioned U.S. support for the 
construction of bridges and roads in the northern border area 
in the context of our alternative development efforts, 
Andrade commented that fighting narco-trafficking is 
important to the GOE.  He said that the MOT is presenting to 
President Correa alternative plans on how to continue 
counter-narcotics cooperation when the Manta FOL agreement 
expires in 2009.  Noting his experience as the former 
director of the Manta port, he said that managing the 
situation would be very important since Manta port activity 
has multiplied twenty times in the last two years. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Andrade confirmed that plans to develop the 
"Manta-to-Manaus" intermodal transport link were still 
underway.  The GOE is pursuing international cooperation on 
the project, and Andrade estimated that in 15 years it would 
provide Ecuador access to the Atlantic and Brazil access to 
the Pacific. 
 
¶6.  (U) When the Ambassador mentioned a recent FAA visit to 
Quito, Andrade said briefly that the GOE was happy with our 
joint efforts to improve airport security and that continued 
U.S. assistance was most welcome. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Finally, Andrade commented that the private sector 
should be an ally of the government, in contrast to "the 
situation in Venezuela" and that he did not think that Correa 
wanted things to be otherwise. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Comment:  Andrade came across as a new minister 
determined to show that his ministry is committed to changing 
the status quo.  As the highest-ranking Correa administration 
official hailing from the key coastal province of Manabi, 
Andrade has political weight beyond his portfolio.  National 
highways and the Manta port will clearly be his priorities, 
possibly leaving aviation to be managed at the under 
secretary level.  Andrade's efforts to differentiate Ecuador 
 
SIPDIS 
from Venezuela echoed comments from Mauricio Davalos, 
Minister for Coordination of Production and Economic Policy 
in a meeting with the Ambassador earlier the same day. His 
comment about cooperation to replace FOL flights 
post-agreement seems to reflect a typically murky 
understanding of the FOL presence; we suspect Andrade is 
hinting at U.S. support for Manta's airport and seaport.  We 
will try to convince him that renewal of the FOL is the best 
means to garner on-going USG support for Manta's airport and 
transportation infrastructure.  End comment.
