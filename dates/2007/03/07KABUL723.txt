SUBJECT: PRT FARAH: A NEW GOVERNOR TAKES OFFICE 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY:  Farah Province welcomed its third governor 
in six months as Mawlawi Mohideen Baluch took up office 
January 31.  In a public speech, Baluch outlined his 
priorities to build a madrassa and university, improve the 
economy, maintain existing Iran-Afghan relations, reach out 
to anti-government and criminal elements, improve security, 
and travel to all districts and assess local officials.  A 
key goal will be to promote coordination and cooperation 
among local officials, donors, and the PRT.  He welcomes 
Iranian assistance but does not want to become dependent on 
Iran.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2. (U) Mawlawi Mohideen Baluch, Farah's third governor in six 
months, arrived January 31 to a welcoming crowd of local 
officials, ANP, ANA, and children bearing flowers.  He 
delivered his first public speech on February 1, highlighting 
the importance of building a madrassa and university in 
Farah.  The new Governor called on Farah,s economy to be 
self-supporting and assured citizens he would focus on their 
needs and problems.  Baluch plans to meet with religious and 
tribal leaders and elders, both in Farah City and throughout 
the province, to engage on development and security concerns. 
 He also hopes to reach out to anti-government and criminal 
elements through open discussion.  Baluch expressed his hope 
for a dam in the province and noted the current dam survey 
underway in Bakhshabad, Bala Baluk District. 
 
¶3. (SBU) A key goal will be to promote coordination among 
local officials, donors, and the PRT.  The new Governor 
understands the need for a comprehensive Provincial 
Development Plan and that province-wide surveys are 
necessary.  While he is willing, he says, to accept 
assistance from Iran, he does not want to foster dependence 
on Iran, e.g., he will allow Iran to provide electricity to 
Farah but only until the Bakhshabad Dam is built and Farah 
can provide for itself.  Baluch added that although he lived 
in Iran for seven years, he has no desire to build up 
relations and has no political interests in Iran.  He will 
accept Iran's planned assistance program as it was approved 
by the GOA. 
 
¶4. (U) Baluch will soon make his choice for Deputy Governor, 
a position vacant since July 2006.  Former Governor Stanikzai 
was set to name someone just before he left, but Baluch will 
now make the choice.  Baluch mentioned his concerns about 
some district administrators, police chiefs, and other 
officials and plans to review personnel performance as he 
travels around the province. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Bio Information: 
 
Mawlawi (Mullah) Mohideen Baluch is a member of the Baluch 
tribe and was born in Farah Province in 1949.  His parents 
were from Nimroz Province.  He attended primary school in 
Farah and graduated in 1972 from a religious high school in 
Kandahar.  A Sunni Hanifi, both he and his father served as 
mullahs in Farah.  Baluch was a mullah and religious teacher 
in Bakwa District for seven years. 
In 1979-80 Baluch openly criticized the Communist government 
and in 1980 fled to Iran, speaking out against the miserable 
conditions of Afghans in Iranian refugee camps.  Baluch 
opened a political office in Iran for the 
Hezb-Islami-Maulawi-Khales party.  After seven years he 
decided to leave Iran and spent the next several years in and 
out of Quetta, Pakistan.  Four of his years were in a refugee 
camp, while his family remained there 14 years, from 
1989-2003.  Baluch left in 1993 for Nimroz Province.  He 
served from 1993-98 as Nimroz Deputy Governor. 
 
Baluch then returned to Quetta to join Karzai.  He did not 
physically fight against the Taliban but participated in 
peace discussions, accompanying Karzai to Frankfurt, 
Islamabad, Istanbul, and Bonn.  In 1999 Baluch attended a 
25-day peace-building workshop in Omaha, Nebraska.  The 
 
KABUL 00000723  002 OF 002 
 
 
program included additional days to tour the U.S.  He will 
continue informally as one of President Karzai,s religious 
advisors. 
 
Governor Baluch has two wives and 14 children -- ten 
daughters (four married) and five sons (two married), one of 
whom the Taliban killed.  The family resides in Kabul. 
 
Languages include Dari/Farsi, Arabic, Pashto, and Baluchi. 
He speaks no English.
