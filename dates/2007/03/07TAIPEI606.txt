SUBJECT: AIT REQUESTS AUSTR STRATFORD WRITE MINISTER OF ED 
TO PUSH FOR IPR ACTION - EVEN TIPO ASKS FOR HELP 
 
REF: TAIPEI 135 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 3. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  With little movement on the IPR front from the 
Ministry of Education, contacts at the Taiwan Intellectual 
Property Office now openly share their frustrations with AIT 
about their difficulties in getting the MOE to take 
meaningful action on IPR issues.  At the March 6 digital 
video conference with USTR and other agencies on compulsory 
licensing, Margaret Chan, Secretary General of TIPO openly 
stated that "We have worked as hard as you" to engage MOE on 
this issue.  At that meeting she asked for help from the USG 
to arrange capacity-building events for university computer 
center staff on IPR issues.  TIPO has repeatedly asked AIT to 
push MOE as well and said that a letter from USTR reinforcing 
USG concerns would be helpful. Today another TIPO contact 
called and asked specifically for USTR to send a letter to 
the Minister of Education copying the Premier, Vice Premier, 
and the Minister of Economic Affairs.  They have come to the 
conclusion that only high-level pressure is likely to trigger 
action.  AIT recommends copying the Minister of Economic 
Affairs and mentioning the letter to Vice-Premier Tsai. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  AIT recommends that a letter under the signature 
of Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Tim Stratford be sent 
to Education Minister Tu as soon as possible.  The letter 
should recap their December meeting, reinforce USG concerns, 
and remind that IPR is central to the TIFA process.  Here is 
a draft letter for AUSTR's consideration: 
 
BEGIN DRAFT TEXT 
Tu Cheng-sheng 
Minister of Education 
5 Chungshan S. Road 
Taipei 100 
TAIWAN 
 
Dr. Minister Tu: 
 
Thank you for taking time to meet with me during my visit to 
Taipei in December.  I very much appreciated the opportunity 
to discuss intellectual property rights on university 
campuses and on TANet.  The U.S. - Taiwan intellectual 
property rights dialogue is an important part of our Trade 
Investment Framework Agreement talks and central to our 
overall economic relationship. 
 
As we discussed, protecting intellectual property rights in 
schools and universities is important, not only to protect 
the rights-holders of today, but also to ensure we instill in 
our young people a respect for IPR.  This serves as a 
foundation for all of our efforts to build a society that 
values ideas and creativity. 
 
As the Ministry of Education continues to tackle the IPR 
issue, I encourage you to appoint a senior-level official to 
take responsibility for IPR protection and establish a task 
force under his or her leadership to make progress on IPR 
protection.  Rights-holders tell me because universities and 
schools exercise a great deal of autonomy, it is important 
for the Ministry to demonstrate a commitment at the highest 
level to address IPR problems.  This task force could include 
university presidents, scholars in the IPR field, technology 
experts, and rights-holders. 
 
In closing, let me again express my appreciation for your 
interest in this issue which is central to the U.S.-Taiwan 
bilateral relationship.  I look forward to working with you 
and your staff as we tackle this difficult issue. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Timothy Stratford
