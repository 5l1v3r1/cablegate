¶1. (SBU) Polmil Deputy Counselor delivered reftel A message 
on March 5 to Ayoob Erfani, Director General of the MFA's UN 
Affairs Department.  Mr. Erfani had not previously heard of 
the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (CICNT), 
but said that the GOA would review the matter mindful of its 
importance.  Prior to the meeting with Erfani, polmiloff had 
coordinated the approach to the GOA with Jangarian Levan, the 
Russian Embassy POC for this issue.  Mr. Levan will meet 
separately with Mr. Erfani on March 6, and reiterate the 
invitation to the GOA to endorse the CICNT. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Given the thematic overlap of detection, mitigation, 
regulation, and enforcement issues between the CICNT and the 
export control matters discussed in reftel B, as well as the 
GOA's interest in establishing an independent Afghan Nuclear 
Affairs Commission, Border Management Initiative Advisor 
(Embassy EXBS program POC) accompanied Polmil Deputy 
Counselor to the meeting to explain the EXBS program and 
outline broad areas in which the USG might be able to provide 
technical assistance to the GOA. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Erfani welcomed the prospect of potential USG 
assistance and undertook to designate a POC on his staff for 
future follow up.  He said that he had received a letter 
March 4 from the Director of the Afghan Environmental 
Protection Agency (AEPA) stating that the AEPA proposes to 
house the future Afghan Nuclear Affairs Commission within 
AEPA facilities.  Erfani also reiterated the GOA's hope that 
the IAEA will be able to provide assistance in this area.
