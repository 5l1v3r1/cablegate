(S) Post fully supports the 2007 East Africa Regional 
Security Initiative, including the training components for 
border and coastal security.  The initiative reinforces the 
Mission's strategic goals including counterterrorism and 
military-to-military engagement with Kenya.  We will include 
in training programs elements of Kenya's civilian 
Anti-Terrorist Police Unit, a dedicated Anti-Terrorist Unit, 
as means of improving military-police coordination in Kenya.
