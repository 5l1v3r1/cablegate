SUBJECT: REO BRINGS BASRAH LEADERS TOGETHER 
 
¶1.  Summary and introduction: On February 28 REO Basrah's 
director hosted a farewell luncheon for the outgoing UK Consul 
General, Ros Marsden, with local prominent officials in 
attendance.  The luncheon was also intended to kick-start a 
dialogue between Basrah's Governor; Basrah Provincial Council 
(BPC) members; and tribal, business, and religious leaders as 
Basrah moves ever closer to Provincial Iraqi Control (PIC).  The 
discussion focused on finding a local solution to the violence 
which plagues the city.  Although the guests were all in 
agreement that the only way to get Basrah back on its feet was 
to increase security and address unemployment, they disagreed on 
the best mechanism to achieve this goal.  Nevertheless, momentum 
for such discussion has now been established and the 
participants agreed to continue to work towards viable 
solutions.  The press was invited in at the conclusion of the 
event to interview the participants.  The REO is hopeful that 
the exchange will not only improve the PIC process but encourage 
local Iraqis to take greater control of their futures.  End 
summary. 
 
¶2.  The luncheon was attended by Basrah Governor Mohammed Al 
Wa'eli, BPC Deputy Chairwoman Ezra Al-Saad, former BPC member 
and leader of the Al-Kanaan tribe Sheikh Mansour Al-Kanaan, 
moderate Shia imam Saeed Ali Al-Musawi, moderate Sunni cleric 
Sheikh Khalid Al-Mulla, and Chairman of the Basrah Business 
Center Abdul Hafidh Al-Aty.  All share the vision of Basrah as 
another Dubai, but agreed this is not possible until violence 
abates, international investment increases, and unemployment 
numbers come down.  The deputy director opined that Basrah had 
to stop looking to Dubai as the example and to instead make 
Basrah the example to follow; an idea that seemed to resonate 
with the crowd.  Disagreement arose when the Governor stated 
that with greater powers, he could clean up the corrupt police, 
who he considered to be the root of the problem.  Sheikh Mansour 
countered  that "we need to avoid listening to just one person" 
when it came to creating a solution for securing Basrah. 
Blaming the Coalition for Basrah's woes by mishandling the 
creation of the security forces, Sheikh Mansour insisted that 
since the Coalition created the problem, it needed to fix it. 
 
¶3.  The group also focused on the "lack" of reconstruction 
projects. (Note.  Over a billion dollars has been spent or 
obligated for Basrah province but local perception is that the 
Coalition has done nothing to improve their city.  End note.) 
Tying international investment and technical support for 
projects to a reduced unemployment figure, Al-Aty advised that 
the local Basrahwis could not "do it alone."  There was 
consensus that the UK troop reductions would help alleviate some 
security concerns, but the participants also called for U.S. and 
UK FDI to help Basrah rebuild its economy.  Comment: With 
increased dialogue and press attention on the topic, the 
discussion may finally move to the point of solution.  End 
comment.
