SUBJECT: Nicaragua's first export of ethanol, Ortega may not be 
supportive 
 
REF: 06 MANAGUA 2384 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  On February 19, Nicaragua exported ethanol for 
the first time, sending 3 million liters (793,000 gallons) valued at 
$2 million to the Netherlands.  Grupo Pellas plans to increase 
production of ethanol from 100,000 to 400,000 liters per day by the 
end of 2008.  If Nicaragua approves blending domestic gasoline with 
10% ethanol, Grupo Pellas will dedicate all of its production to the 
domestic market.  Despite the potential to produce more ethanol, 
President Daniel Ortega has backed away from his earlier support of 
biofuels, recently voicing some of the same criticisms as Venezuelan 
President Hugo Chavez.  Ortega's flip flop and deference to Chavez 
is causing a political stir.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) Nicaragua Sugar Estates Limited and Compania Licorera de 
Nicaragua -- both members of Grupo Pellas, Nicaragua's largest 
private company -- combined forces to produce ethanol to fill the 
first part of a 20 million liter (5.3 million gallon) contract with 
Vertical (United Kingdom).  Over the next several months, Grupo 
Pellas will deliver five more shipments of 3-4 million liters each 
to Vertical. 
 
¶3. (U) Grupo Pellas has invested more than $45 million in plant and 
equipment, as well in storage tanks and offloading facilities at the 
Port of Corinto to develop its ethanol business.  Project Director 
Alvaro Martinez explains that the business is viable as long as 
international crude prices exceed $45 a barrel.  If prices fall 
below $45, Grupo Pellas will simply increase production of their 
flagship "Flor de Cana" rum.  As it stands, Grupo Pellas plans to 
increase production of ethanol from 100,000 to 400,000 liters per 
day by the end of 2008.  If Nicaragua approves blending domestic 
gasoline with 10% ethanol, Grupo Pellas will dedicate all of its 
production to the domestic market. 
 
¶4. (U) Despite this success and the potential to produce more 
ethanol (reftel), President Ortega has backed away from his earlier 
support of biofuels.  During a meeting with A/S Sullivan on February 
27, for example, Ortega expressed interest in developing biofuels as 
an alternative energy source, even highlighting the fact that 
several U.S. investors have been exploring possibilities in 
Nicaragua.  After President Bush's recent tour of Latin America and 
Venezuelan President Chavez' shadow tour which included Nicaragua, 
however, Ortega has changed his tune.  On March 17, Ortega was 
quoted as decrying ethanol for threatening food security and 
encouraging Latin America to return to cash crops and 
monocultivation.  He has equated U.S. interest in advancing biofuel 
production to an imperialist attempt to create dependency on the 
U.S. market so that American citizens can continue their "wasteful 
spending on more vehicles."  Ortega followed his comment with the 
cancellation of his trip to Brazil, where he was scheduled to 
confirm ministry-to-ministry cooperative agreements on biofuel 
production (as well as hydroelectric power, rural access to 
electricity, and the regulatory regime for oil and gas 
exploration). 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: Venezuela's absolute rejection of the 
InterAmerican Development Bank's (IDB) proposed $200 million lending 
facility to support regional production of ethanol caused a stir in 
Nicaragua when Venezuelan Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro Moros 
added that Nicaragua supported Venezuela's opposition.  Chavez was 
quoted as saying, "With President Ortega, we say that we will not 
allow them to turn Latin America into producers of corn and sugar 
cane for American cars."  Immediately after Maduro's comments 
Nicaraguan Foreign Minster Samuel Santos was quoted as saying that 
Nicaragua would explore and work with all kinds of energy sources, 
including ethanol, but was seemingly contradicted later by Ortega. 
In Nicaragua, Ortega's flip flop and deference to Chavez is 
attracting attention.  Local newspapers have been playing up the 
issue, as have opinion writers and cartoonists in the context of 
Ortega's relationship with Chavez.  Grupo Pellas, IDB, and 
International Institute for Cooperation in Agriculture 
representatives have come forward to espouse the potential to 
develop the industry and the positive aspects of biofuels.  Sadly, 
adopting Chavez's path would mean that Nicaragua will only become 
more dependent upon Venezuela and the oil that it produces. End 
Comment.
