¶1.  (U)  Summary.  In early morning on 23 March a hand 
grenade was used to vandalize a Genocide Memorial Site near 
the border town of Cyangugu.  The unidentified perpetrators 
were driven off by GOR security forces without causing 
extensive damage to the site.  Few additional facts are 
available but GOR authorities suspect local supporters of the 
Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), 
recently released prisoners and/or gacaca suspects and note 
that incidents of vandalism and violence against genocide 
survivors are not uncommon during this time of year due to 
the increased tension during the annual period of mourning. 
End summary. 
 
¶2. (U) According to an RSO source with close ties to Rwandan 
security services, at approximately 01h00 local time a hand 
grenade was tossed at a memorial containing the remains of 
over 2,000 genocide victims in Gashonga Sector, Rusizi 
District, Western Province.  The vandals reportedly lobbed at 
least one hand grenade at the memorial before being fired at 
and chased off by local defense forces (LDF) personnel who 
were guarding a nearby bank.  (Note. The LDF is a local 
militia used by the GOR to augment the Rwandan National 
Police (RNP).  End note.) There were no casualties and the 
perpetrators avoided capture however, they reportedly left 
behind a five liter gerrycan of gasoline and matches. 
 
¶3. (SBU) On 26 March, a Presidential Advisor told poloff that 
this kind of act was not unusual in the weeks leading up to 
the period of mourning and may have been committed by 
individuals implicated in gacaca or local Rwandans with ties 
to the FDLR.  He added that the GOR expected more incidents 
of vandalism and attacks on survivors and gacaca witnesses. 
Although the pro-government English daily "The New Times" 
reported that "Rwandan insurgents operating from the DRC" 
were responsible, all GOR sources contacted by emboffs 
thought the perpetrators were most likely from, and still 
located in, the immediate area. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment.  The annual week of mourning, 7-14 April, 
is always tense in Rwanda.  Factors that will likely 
aggravate the tension this year include the February release 
of approximately 7,000 prisoners accused of genocide crimes 
and the start of nationwide gacaca hearings in July 2006. 
After this act of vandalism, as with other such incidents, 
Rwandan officials, reacting in a generally composed and 
resolute manner, noted that genocide ideology is alive and 
well in the country. End comment.
