POLITICAL 
 
YASAMDA GUNDEM: Gundem daily reappeared on the shelves today 
as under the following newspaper title: "Yasamda Gundem" (Life's 
Agenda).  (This summary is from March 9 edition.) 
 
HURRIYET (CUKUROVA) / EKSPRES / BOLGE:  Police and anti-riot 
teams went to Barabaros quarter of Adana upon receiving a 
tip-off that an unauthorized demonstration would be held there. 
As the police waited at the entrance of the quarter, children 
started gathering around the officers, conversation developed 
between police and children, and the two groups decided to play 
football as they formed two teams each of which was comprised of 
nine players.  The game ended 2-2. 
 
YASAMDA GUNDEM: Mardin Deputy from AKP, Nihat Eri, who 
responded questions from opposition parties over why TSK 
(Turkish Armed Forces) was not undertaking de-mining on the 
southeastern border and the government was instead preparing to 
hold tenders for that task, said that TSK actually undertook 
that task initially, but, at the end of one year of work 
reportedly decided that it would not continue it.  The daily 
claims that TSK's withdrawal revealed a conflict between the 
government and the army. 
 
YASAMDA GUNDEM / EVRENSEL:      Evrensel daily points out that 
ahead of Newroz celebrations, Ilker Basbug, Land Forces 
Commander, went to Diyarbakir the other day to issue messages 
about upcoming Newroz.  Basbug reportedly told people that 
ending the PKK's existence in the northern Iraq and Iraq's 
territorial integrity were two top priorities for Turkey. 
Yasamda Gundem daily reported that Basbug told people that they 
would not allow people to wear clothes or use fabric or material 
in colors representing Kurdish identity, namely green, yellow 
and red, and, that using those colors would be deemed a 
terrorist act.  The Yasamda Gundem daily interprets that 
development as TSK pressuring people from attending DTP-led 
Newroz celebrations in mass numbers.  The daily further reports 
bitter rivalry between official bodies and DTP-led committee 
concerning Newroz celebrations in Igdir province.  The governor 
announced that they declared state of mobilization for official 
celebrations to be participated by more people than DTP's 
celebrations.  DTP Kiziltepe party organization in Mardin will 
renew its application to hold its celebrations on March 21 
because authorities did not grant permission to Newroz committee 
for March 18.   Committees in Van and Mus requested permission 
from authorities to hold Newroz on March 21.  Committees in 
Hakkari and Bitlis requested permission from authorities for 
March 17. 
 
EKSPRES / BOLGE:        Adana Governor Cahit Kirac, who is assigned to 
a new post in Izmir, is paying farewell visits to political
