¶3.  (U) The roundtable focused on Brazil's general business 
environment, as well as the companies' different Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) programs.  After opening the meeting with a 
thank you to all the participants, Ambassador Sobel turned the floor 
over to Alex Silva, Chairman of AmCham Brazil and President of GE 
Brazil.  After discussing GE's history and profile, Silva spoke of 
the different issues facing businesses in Brazil - namely, 
bureaucracy and high taxes.  Silva did mention that while Brazil 
presents significant challenges, GE operates across the globe and 
has experience in even more difficult markets.  He added that the 
CEO of GE Global continues to be bullish on Brazil, and the company 
expects to see continued revenue growth from the market.  Turning to 
his role as AmCham Chairman, Mr. Silva spoke of the different CSR 
initiatives the organization has, including the Eco Award, which 
brought Al Gore to Brazil in 2006 as the keynote speaker. 
 
¶4.  (U) Silva was followed by the President of IBM Brazil, Rogerio 
Oliveira, who said the company had tripled in size over the last few 
years and was moving fully into a services model.  The GoB, he 
added, does not yet understand the power and potential that services 
can bring to an economy.  While the government has some programs to 
promote services, strict labor laws and high taxes have limited the 
sector.  Yet both IBM and Ford, who spoke after IBM, remained

optimistic and bullish on Brazil.  In January, Ford announced a USD 
one billion investment in Brazil's northeastern region, which 
Ambassador Sobel highlighted.  Ford South America was the company's 
largest profit center last year and expects plan to continue such 
growth through the recent acquisition of the Troller brand and a new 
vehicle launch in Sao Paulo later this year. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Michel Levy of Microsoft provided a brief overview of the 
company's CSR initiatives, and also spoke of the company's concern 
with protection of intellectual property in Brazil.  Caterpillar's 
President, Natal Garcia, followed by saying that while business is 
going well and the company exports 25 percent of its production to 
the United States, a bilateral trade agreement between the two 
countries is needed.  He added that while the economy and business 
continue to expand, Brazil's infrastructure bottlenecks make such 
growth less sustainable, and that tax, social security, and other 
reforms are badly needed.  Garcia referred to Caterpillar's 
successful CSR support for sustainable logging in the Amazon, in 
collaboration with USAID, as an example of their social programs. 
He also expressed concern with what he sees as anti-Americanism 
among some elements of the Brazilian government.  AES Sao Paulo also 
referred to their projects in collaboration with USAID, to extend 
electricity to millions of new, low-income clients.  AES openly 
promotes the idea that CSR and strategic business decisions can be 
made hand-in-hand. 
 
¶6.  (U) U/S Burns closed the meeting by thanking all participants 
and reiterating the idea that while Brazil and the U.S. are allies, 
much room exists for improved strategic projects and stronger 
relations.  He called on the Brazilian government to take on a more 
active global role, from security to all other issues, much as he 
has seen in India. 
 
¶7.  (U) This cable was coordinated with Embassy Brasilia and cleared 
by U/S Burns's delegation and Ambassador Sobel.
