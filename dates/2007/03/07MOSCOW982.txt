¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a Pre-license check to determine 
the legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, Igor 
Kochemasov, Nizhny Novgorod, Russia. The party is 
listed on BIS license application D371236 as the 
ultimate consignee of a device incorporated with 
320X240 uncooled microbolometer focal plane array. 
These items are controlled for national security, 
nuclear non-proliferation reasons under ECCN 6A003. 
The licensee is Vandolay, Inc., 257 Chinquapin Ave., 
Carlsbad, CA 92008. 
 
¶3. On March 1, 2007, Export Control Attache Donald 
Pearce and FSN Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested pre-license check at the offices of the 
Nizhny Novgorod Center of Creative Technologies, Ltd. 
(NCTC), Nizhny Novgorod, Russia. The export control 
team met with Igor Kochemasov, General Director. 
 
¶4. NCTC was founded in 1996 as a small enterprise 
conducting research and development projects for 
medical and consumer end uses.  The company has 
developed a series of successful projects such as the 
"N-Jet" laser printing system for manicure design, a 
sensor based body-fat analyzer, and various 
dermatological products.  The company employs sixteen 
at its offices and design facility located in an 
industrial park in Nizhny Novgorod.  NCTC has the 
ability to do small-scale production, but the 
principal focus of the business is prototype design 
and production. 
 
¶5. NCTC has contracted with U.S. based Vandolay 
Industries of California to produce a laser hand 
treatment device.  The device will utilize the thermal 
imager in reftel to map the veins of the hand, and 
employs a laser to minimize the appearance of varicose 
veins.  NCTC will incorporate the imager into the 
prototype, which will then be returned to Vandolay in 
the U.S. 
 
¶6. While the imager is in the control of NCTC it will 
be stored in a secure room for valuable commodities. 
The facility is located on an industrial area, which 
has a 24-hour security presence.  Access to the imager 
will be limited to the engineers and designers on the 
project.  The imager will be returned to Vandolay upon 
completion of design and testing. 
 
¶7. Recommendations: Post recommends NCTC and Igor 
Kochemasov, Nizhny Novgorod, Russia, as reliable 
recipients of sensitive U.S. origin commodities. It is 
requested that post be notified of final disposition 
of the application and of any shipments for this 
organization, in order to conduct appropriate FCS 
follow-up and statistical reporting.
