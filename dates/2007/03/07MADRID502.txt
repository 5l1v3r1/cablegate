¶1. (SBU)  Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Spanish MFA 
Subdirector General for the UN Juan Manuel Gonzales de 
LINARES Palou on March 15.  Linares appreciated USG concern 
on this matter and said that the most important point of UN 
reform was to do no harm to the organization.  He agreed with 
the U.S. that several areas of potential reform remained 
vague, and he said that the Secretary General needed to 
provide greater clarification.  His comments on specific 
reforms are summarized below. 
 
//INFORMAL SYSTEM AGREEMENTS// 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Spain is in total agreement that a complainant who 
reaches a mutually agreed solution through mediation should 
have no later recourse to the formal judicial system. 
Linares said that the relationship between the formal and 
informal systems is unclear and greater clarification is 
necessary. 
 
//UNDEFINED DUTIES// 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Linares said that Spain is in agreement that there 
are no abstract duties of an international organization to 
its employees other than those stated in the rules and 
regulations of that organization.  He said that the 
recommendations should clarify this point. 
 
//ROLE OF STAFF ASSOCIATIONS// 
 
¶4. (SBU)  In the interest of saving time and money, Spain 
will support class actions by staff associations if the suits 
represent an identifiable and finite group of employees. 
However, Spain would not support class actions on behalf of 
an unidentified or abstract group of employees. 
 
//JURISDICTION// 
 
¶5. (SBU)  Linares said that clarification and greater 
analysis is necessary on the question of which groups of 
employees are covered.  Spain feels that any PSC employee who 
is held to UN rules and regulations should have redress to a 
UN internal judicial system.  He noted that the Secretary 
General would exclude military personnel, interns and 
volunteers (other than "UN volunteers") from the system.  The 
system would give redress to former employees as well as 
representatives of deceased employees.  But Linares said that 
Spain needed clarification on several points, including the 
number of PSC's and the different types of PSC's which could 
be affected by this decision.  He also wanted clarification 
on what constitutes a UN remunerated position.  In general, 
Spain does not feel that this system should exclude a large 
portion of UN staff. 
 
//DAMAGE AWARDS// 
 
¶6. (SBU)  Spain agrees that punitive damages should be 
excluded.  On the question of the two-year salary cap, 
Linares said that Spain would support damages above the 
two-year cap in certain exceptional circumstances and would 
therefore propose that the language reflect something akin to 
"damages should 'normally' not exceed two-years' salary." 
 
//PERSONAL LIABILITY OF STAFF// 
 
¶7. (SBU)  Linares admitted that he did not have any knowledge 
of liability questions within the context of the UN, noting 
that all Spanish diplomats face liability and therefore pay 
into a professional liability insurance fund. 
 
//OFFICE OF COUNSEL// 
 
¶8. (SBU)  Linares wants greater clarification from the 
Secretary General on what the role of the Office of Staff 
 
SIPDIS 
Legal Assistance would be.  He said that Spain could 
understand if the office's role would be to provide advice. 
If however it would represent complainants against the UN, it 
would seem better suited to a staff association. 
 
//FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS// 
 
¶9. (SBU)  Spain's understanding is that the total additional 
cost of these reforms would be around 27 million dollars a 
year; Linares agreed on the importance of examining the 
potential for indirect costs and clarifying the funding of 
these reforms.
