REF: A. STATE 223284 (PRESSING HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL) 
     ¶B. STATE 34009 (BUILDING INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT) 
 
¶1. (U) We raised the situation in Zimbabwe in a March 21 
meeting with Heru Santoso and Dicky Yunus of the Indonesian 
Department of Foreign Affairs' Human Rights Directorate, per 
reftels.  We urged the GOI to publicly condemn the Zimbabwe 
regime's violence against the opposition and to support 
urgent Human Rights Council action on the matter.  Santoso 
and Yunus agreed to review the issue and to refer it to the 
head of their directorate for a decision.  We stressed that 
the credibility of the Human Rights Council was at stake. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment.  The Indonesians have first-hand experience 
of President Mugabe's volatility and animus towards the West. 
 In 2005, he attended a conference in Jakarta commemorating 
the 50th anniversary of the Bandung Conference at which he 
launched a tirade against the U.S. and U.K.  Nevertheless, 
the Indonesians have a strong aversion in principle to 
"naming and shaming" specific countries, and we doubt they 
will have much to say about this subject, either in Jakarta 
or Geneva.  End comment.
