(SBU)  A contact at the Liaison Agency with International 
Organizations (LAWIO) reported that violence ensued on the 
Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing at 
approximately 10:00 A.M. on March 8 as a large crowd of 
Palestinians attempted to enter the border terminal.  The 
contact said that Palestinian security forces fired into the 
air to regain control of the crowd.  He could not comment on 
press reports that one man died and seven people suffered 
injuries, but confirmed that 300 people crossed from Gaza 
into Egypt and 142 crossed from Egypt into Gaza during the 
opening.
