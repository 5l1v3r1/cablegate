Poloff delivered reftel demarche on March 19 to the Director 
of Political Affairs, Weiner Jean Baptiste.  As an observer 
member of the African Union, Jean Baptiste said that Haiti 
will wait for, and follow, the AU's guidance.  He expressed 
disgust and disappointment with Zimbabwean President Mugabe's 
conduct.  The text of Secretary Rice's statement prompted 
Jean Baptiste to comment that South African President Thabo 
Mbeki's "discrete negotiations" were likely to have a 
stronger impact than any public statement from the West.
