SUBJECT: TURKEY CFE ENTITLEMENT TRANSFER MOU 
 
REF: STATE 37715 
 
¶1. (SBU) As requested reftel, we informed MFA Arms Control 
DDG Ahmet Muhtar Gun's office that the U.S. agrees with all 
of the Turkish proposed changes to the draft text of the CFE 
entitlement transfer MOU, and that we seek to put the MOU 
into final form, exchange notes, and transmit the text to 
Washington for final approval as soon as possible. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In Gun's absence on March 26, we explained to Haldum 
Erdem, CFE expert on this staff, that we accept Turkey's 
proposed text for Article II, para d, regarding any 
retransfer of entitlements, but that we desire to establish a 
mechanism for timely consultations on retransfer requests. 
We stressed that we are not seeking any modification of the 
MOU text on this issue. 
 
¶3. (SBU) We also advised Erdem that we have considered how to 
address Article III regarding the timeline the issuance of 
future CFE Treaty notifications that would result from any 
decision to alter the MOU.  Again, we emphasized that we are 
not seeking any changes to the text as we do not regard 
reference to this point as essential.  We did inform Erdem 
that if Turkey seeks explicit language on future 
notifications, we would be prepared to offer a final sentence 
as provided reftel. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Erdem was appreciative of U.S. agreement on the 
text, promised to pass our points to Gun, and suggested that 
we follow up with Gun on March 27 regarding the exchange of 
notes.
