REF: SECSTATE 24344 
 
¶1. (SBU)  Following March 1 delivery of the U.S. 60-day 
report (reftel), the MFA Office for Non-Proliferation, Arms 
Control and Combatting Terrorism shared Romania's 60-day 
report on UNSCR 1737 implementation. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Begin report: 
 
Report submitted by Romania on the implementation of the 
Security Council resolution 1737 (2006) 
Paragraph 19 of Security Council resolution 1737 (2006) calls 
upon all Member States of the United Nations to report to the 
Security Council within sixty days of the adoption of the 
resolution on the steps they have taken with a view to 
implementing effectively the provisions of the following 
paragraphs of resolution 1737 (2006): 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 
12, 17. 
Romania, as a member of the European Union (EU), has been 
participating in the preparations of legal instruments 
implementing the provisions of resolution 1737 (2006). 
 
In its conclusions adopted on 22 January 2007, the Council of 
the European Union welcomed the measures in Resolution 1737 
and called on all countries to implement the measures in full 
and without delay. On 12 February 2007, the Council of the 
European Union politically endorsed a draft Common Position 
concerning restrictive measures against Iran.  Preparations 
are under way to adopt without delay a Council Regulation. 
Further information will be provided to the Security Council 
once the Common Position and Regulation have been adopted. 
 
After the adoption of the relevant EU Common Position and 
Regulation, all legal instruments will be automatically 
applied to the Romanian national legislation. 
 
At the national level, according to the provisions of the 
Romanian legislation (Law no.206/2005) (Although Romania is 
not a member of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), 
its Guidelines are voluntarily implemented at national level 
since 1992), the United Nations Security Council Resolution 
1737 (2006) was published in the Romanian Official Journal, 
no. 60 of 25 January 2007, becoming thus legally binding for 
all the Romanian subjects. 
However, the enforcement of the provisions of resolution 1737 
(2006) by the Romanian institutions had been initiated on the 
date of its adoption. 
Referring to the provisions of the aforementioned paragraphs 
of resolution 1737 (2006), the following measures have been 
taken: 
a.  The authorized Romanian companies involved in foreign 
trade with military and dual-use goods were formally notified 
on the provisions of resolution 1737 (2006); 
 
b.     A formal decision was taken aimed at denying direct or 
indirect supply, sale or transfer to Iran, through Romania's 
territory or by its nationals, or using its flag vessels or 
aircraft, and whether or not originating in its territory, of 
the items, materials, equipment, goods and technology, as set 
out in the lists in documents S/2006/814 and S/2006/815, 
which could contribute to Iran's enrichment-related, 
reprocessing, or heavy-water activities or to the development 
of nuclear weapon delivery systems, referred to in paragraph 
3 of the resolution. 
 
c.  Several Romanian institutions have been conducting 
activities aimed at preventing any direct or indirect supply, 
sale or transfer to Iran by intermediate individuals or 
entities acting on Romanian territory, of items, materials, 
equipment, goods and technology, which could contribute to 
Iran's enrichment-related, reprocessing, or heavy-water 
activities or to the development of nuclear weapon delivery 
systems, envisaged by the paragraph 4 of resolution 1737 
(2006).  ANCEX (the National Agency for Export Controls 
(ANCEX) was established in 1992 and is responsible for the 
enforcement of Government policy on export control of 
military and dual-use goods and technologies.  Since 2001, 
ANCEX is subordinated to the Romanian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs) organized two workshops focused on nuclear issues 
and nuclear-related activities: a round table dealing with: 
"The control of dual-use goods in the nuclear field at the EU 
level" and a meeting on "International trends and concerns on 
the export control of machine-tools." 
 
d.      A mechanism was set up for the exchange of 
information between all competent Romanian authorities 
regarding the funds, other financial assets and economic 
 
resources to be used in nuclear weapons proliferation or 
ballistic missiles programmes.  All competent Romanian 
institutions are dully informed and fully aware of their 
obligations. 
 
e.      The Government of Romania has taken all necessary 
steps to implement the financial sanctions and the travel 
restrictions covered in paragraphs 10 and 12, to the 
individuals and entities listed in the annex to the 
resolution. 
 
f.      The National Bank of Romania issued an internal order 
referring to the obligations for the credit/financial 
institutions pursuant to resolution 1737 (2006). 
Furthermore, the Romanian National Securities Commission, the 
autonomous administrative authority responsible for the 
regulation and the survey of financial markets, communicated 
to all its subjects the relevant information concerning 
resolution 1737 (2006), and undertook to prevent the issuance 
of any authorizations to the entities under its surveillance, 
which may be contrary to the provisions of resolution 1737 
(2006). 
 
g.      The institutions involved in the legal mechanism 
established by Law 206/2005 regarding the implementation of 
the international sanctions will meet on a regular basis in 
order to discuss the imposed measures and to maintain a 
continuous flow of information.  Furthermore, under the 
provisions of Law 206/2005, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs shall constantly inform the competent Romanian 
authorities on any delay, violation or failure to implement 
the sanctions imposed by resolution 1737 (2006).
