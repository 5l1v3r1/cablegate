SUBJECT: PERU: DEMARCHE ON KOSOVO PROPOSALS

REF: STATE 37835

Classified By: PolCouns Alexis F. Ludwig for reason 1.4(d).

(C) Polcouns conveyed reftel demarche to MFA's Director
General for Multilateral Affairs Ana Rosa Valdivieso March
Â¶27.  (Attempts to reach Valdivieso and Ambassador Jose
Antonio Garcia Revilla, Minister for Multilateral Affairs, on
March 26 were in vain.)  Valdivieso said Peru agreed that
special envoy Ahtisaari's efforts were commendable, but that
Peru had not yet determined to throw its support fully behind
his report.  She noted the firm support of the U.S. and the
EU for Ahtisaari's conclusions and recommendations while
cautioning that Russia, China and a number of UNSC
non-permanent members -- namely Indonesia, South Africa,
Congo and Panama -- had reservations about them.  In that
sense, she said, Peru believed that more time and additional
negotiations were needed to ensure a constructive outcome.
Regarding the level of the intervention, Valdivieso noted
that her office had prepared a memo for MFA Secretary General
and Vice Minister Gonzalo Gutierrez on the Kosovo issue, but
that the Foreign Minister was not yet read in.
