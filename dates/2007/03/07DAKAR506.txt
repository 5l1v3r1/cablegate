SUMMARY 
------- 
¶1.  (U) At a time when traditional Western donors are 
proceeding slowly with budgetary and program assistance to 
Guinea-Bissau, China is surging ahead with new trade and aid 
programs for the impoverished nation.  The PRC is still 
focused on fishing but is also exploring agricultural 
assistance, hydro-electric projects and other public works 
projects.  Chinese projects often fail to consider the local 
context.  END SUMMARY. 
 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
¶2.  (SBU) China,s influence in Guinea-Bissau is growing 
relative to that of other donors.  European concerns about 
stability, fiscal responsibility, corruption, and drug 
trafficking are having an impact on their donations to the 
GOGB.  Western assistance often comes with reporting and 
performance requirements that the GOGB has little capacity or 
in some cases, political will to meet.  In contrast, Prime 
Minister Aristides Gomes has publicly praised China, noting 
that its assistance and trade packages come with no 
conditionalities. 
 
TRADE 
----- 
¶3.  (U) For the most part, China is seeking access to 
Guinea-Bissau,s rich fishing waters.  And agreement on 
Chinese access to Bissau-Guinean fishing waters yielded the 
GOGB about USD 8 million last year and is one of the 
government's principal sources of revenue.  Chinese fishermen 
sell their catch almost exclusively to European markets. 
 
¶4.  (U) During a two-day visit to Guinea-Bissau in January, 
Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing announced a package of 
trade incentives including duty-free access to Chinese 
markets.  China will also assist Guinea-Bissau in 
strengthening agricultural production and exports. 
Initiatives include cooperation with Chinese technical 
experts using an "online information system." 
 
¶5.  (U) Guinea-Bissau,s biggest agricultural export is 
cashews and Zhaoxing announced USD 60 million in advance 
contracts to support the coming harvesting and marketing 
season.  Another important product is rice, and Chinese 
technicians are helping Bissau-Guinean producers improve 
quality and increase yields.  The PRC Embassy in Bissau told 
Poloff that China has improved strains and rice cultivation 
techniques that it plans to share. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The growing Chinese presence is starting to be felt 
in Guinea-Bissau.  Most notably, two Chinese restaurants have 
opened in Bissau thus far in 2007.  Previously there were no 
Chinese restaurants in the whole country.  Low-cost Chinese 
imports are starting to trickle into the marketplace, 
offering more variety and lower costs to consumers, but in 
some cases, also lower quality than goods traditionally 
imported from Europe. 
 
AID 
--- 
¶7.  (U) China promised USD one million in budgetary support 
at the donor,s round table conference in Geneva in November. 
 Chinese assistance to Guinea-Bissau continues to grow, 
especially in public works projects.  Zhaoxing promised USD 8 
million for new government buildings and USD 5 million for a 
hydro-electric dam on the Geba River.  In November 2006, the 
GOGB announced China was giving an aid package of USD 8.7 
million for development assistance, including the 
construction of a military hospital and courthouse, 
collaboration on deep-sea fishing, and exploration of oil 
reserves.  The Chinese Embassy in Bissau told Poloff that 
China also sends several doctors to Guinea-Bissau to work in 
hospitals and clinics around the country. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
¶8.  (SBU) As in Senegal, we would like to ensure that U.S. 
 
DAKAR 00000506  002 OF 002 
 
 
and Chinese initiatives are complementary where our interests 
converge.  The PRC has been open about its activities in 
Guinea-Bissau.  However, encouraging the Chinese to engage in 
projects that take better account of Guinea-Bissau's 
realities is key.  While the new National Popular Assembly 
building is in use, the housing built for veterans sits empty 
four years after completion because most Bissau-Guineans have 
no history of or interest in living in multi-strory apartment 
buildings.  END COMMENT.
