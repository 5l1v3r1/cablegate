Ref: 05 Abu Dhabi 2741 
 
¶1. (U) On March 14, 2007, semi-official Arabic daily Al Ittihad, 
reported that Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum (MbR), UAE Vice 
President and Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai issued a decree on 
February 27 to channel external humanitarian assistance by 
charities, local governments or other entities through the UAE Red 
Crescent Authority (RCA). The news article said the decision to 
channel assistance through the RCA was presented to the Cabinet by 
Maryam Al Roumi, UAE Minister of Social Affairs. (Comment. The UAE 
passed a law in 2004 mandating that charities route their foreign 
assistance through the UAE Red Crescent.  MbR's decree merely 
reiterates that charities must comply with this law.  End comment.) 
 
 
¶2. (U) Mr. Abdul Rahman Al Tunaigi, Director of Information at the 
UAE Red Crescent, told Econ assistant that local charities already 
coordinate with the UAE Red Crescent, but noted that the decree will 
enhance the regulation of external humanitarian assistance.  Mr. Al 
Tunaigi also said that the large, established UAE charities such as 
the Abu Dhabi-based Sheikh Zayed Foundation and the Dubai-based 
Mohammed bin Rashid Charitable and Humanitarian Foundation, are not 
subject to the decree, but noted that these charities often 
coordinate their external humanitarian assistance with the Red 
Crescent.  Dr. Saleh Al Ta'ai, Red Crescent Director of Relief and 
Emergency Services, confirmed to Econoff that MbR's decree simply 
reiterates the 2002 "Charities Law," which mandates that foreign 
donations be sent through the UAE Red Crescent.
