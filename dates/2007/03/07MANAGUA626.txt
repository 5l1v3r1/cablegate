¶1. (SBU) Summary: Mireya Molina Torres was officially instated as 
the new Property Superintendent on January 25, 2007, replacing 
Alfonso Sandino.  In an unexpected courtesy, Molina paid an 
introductory call to the Embassy's Property Office days before. 
Molina stressed to Emboffs that her goal is to demonstrate progress 
on U.S. citizen property claims so as to again win a Section 527 
waiver, echoing statements made by President Daniel Ortega to U.S. 
officials.  Molina brings a unique perspective to the job.  In the 
1980s, she was intimately involved in the Sandinista land 
redistribution program.  In the 1990s, Molina combined 
professorships at local law schools with a private law practice 
specializing in the privatization of rural enterprises.  In 1997, 
she was a member of the legal team that drafted legislation 
governing extensive property issues (Law 278).  More recently, she 
was the legal counsel for an American citizen with a property claim. 
 End Summary. 
 
Unexpected Courtesy 
------------------- 

¶2. (SBU) Mireya Molina Torres was instated as the new Property 
Superintendent on January 25, 2007, according to the online version 
of Gaceta, the official register of government events.  Her 
predecessor, Alfonso Sandino, had participated in numerous Amcit 
claims resolutions.  On January 18, in an unexpected courtesy, 
Molina paid an introductory call to the Embassy's Property Office, 
coming to the Embassy for the meeting.  Molina stressed to Emboffs 
that her goal was to demonstrate progress on U.S. citizen property 
claims so as to gain a Section 527 waiver [to the Foreign Relations 
Authorization Act (Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995)] again this year. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Molina vowed to do her best to resolve outstanding claims, 
and immediately began going through a list of active claims provided 
by Embassy staff.  At the top of the list are longstanding cases 
close to resolution, but contentious in nature.  Molina is familiar 
with many of the cases, and the people and properties involved.  She 
suggested that we create a trimester work plan, focusing first on 
the best documented cases.  Emboffs agreed. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Emboffs stressed the importance of resolving all 
outstanding claims, including Army-held properties -- an area which 
has proved difficult to broach.  Molina confided that she has good 
contacts within the Army, and that she expects to be able to make 
progress in this area, too. 
 
Comment 
------- 

¶5. (SBU) Molina's desire to make progress on U.S. citizen claims may 
lend credence to statements made by President Daniel Ortega during 
the past several months.  Beginning in his presidential campaign, 
Ortega has made a point of stating that private property rights 
would be respected under his administration.  In addition, Ortega 
has conveyed to visiting U.S. officials his desire to resolve 
outstanding U.S. citizen claims.  End Comment. 
 
Section 527 
----------- 

¶6. (U) Section 527 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act 
prohibits U.S. economic assistance to or support in international 
financial institutions for any country where U.S. citizens have not 
received adequate or effective compensation for outstanding claims 
against a government that has confiscated property owned by U.S. 
citizens.  The Secretary of State has issued a waiver to Section 527 
for Nicaragua in each of the past 13 years.  A key consideration has 
been progress made in resolving outstanding claims.  Of 3191 claims 
subject to Section 527, 682 claims remain. 
 
Biography: Mireya Molina Torres 
------------------------------- 

¶7. (SBU) Mireya Molina Torres brings a unique perspective to the 
job.  In the 1980s, she was the National Director for Land Tenure in 
the Ministry of Agrarian Reform.  In this capacity, she was 
intimately involved in Sandinista land redistribution programs and 
the issuance of land titles, especially to farmers and 
cooperatives. 
 
¶8. (SBU) In the 1990s, Molina combined professorships at local law 
schools with her own private law practice, specializing in the 
privatization of rural enterprises.  In 1997, she was a member of 
the legal team that drafted legislation governing extensive property 
issues, including distribution of state-owned land, titling, claims 
and compensation procedures (Law 278).  More recently, Molina met 
with Embassy staff as legal counsel for an American citizen with a 
property claim in Nicaragua, proving that life, particularly in 
Nicaragua, sometimes comes full circle.
