     ¶B. BUCHAREST 163 
 
¶1. (SBU) On March 18, Israeli Ministry of Defense Blue 
Lantern Inquiry Point of Contact, Rami Yungman, sent by FAX 
to Blue Lantern Officer the following information concerning 
license 05-050010197.  The answers correspond to questions 
put forward by Blue Lantern Officer to David Block Temin, the 
Corporate Vice President and General Counsel for Elbit 
Systems, Ltd., located in Haifa.  Block Temin sent the 
answers via the Israeli MOD, where officials of the MOD's 
Security Division, MALMAB/DSDE, reviewed them before 
approving their release to Blue Lantern Officer. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Begin questions and answers: 
 
¶Q. Can you confirm the delivery of the helicopter parts under 
license 05-050010197? 
 
¶A. We (Elbit Systems, Ltd., or ESL) can confirm the delivery 
of helicopter parts under DSP-5 license no. 05-050010197 (the 
License) for the SHREIK Program. 
 
¶Q. What was the specific role of Elbit in this transaction? 
 
¶A. The SHREIK Program relates to the upgrade of three naval 
helicopters (Puma 330) for the Romanian Ministry of Defense 
(RMOD) for end use by the Romanian Armed Forces.  ESL is the 
avionics subcontractor for the program to IAR S.A. Brasov of 
Romania, which is the prime contractor to the RMOD.  Rockwell 
Collins is a subcontractor to ESL for the supply of the items 
described in the License.  The parts shipped by Rockwell 
Collins under the License were ordered under ESL P/O No. 
DMF825350 (the Purchase Order, or P/O) for the purpose 
described above.  The quantities are two shipsets for each 
helicopter, plus one spare shipset, totaling seven shipsets. 
 
¶Q. Did Elbit ever take possession of the shipment before its 
delivery to Romania? 
 
¶A. ESL did not take possession of the shipments.  Rather, the 
items were delivered as "drop shipments" directly to the 
foreign consignee, IAR S.A. Brasov, in accordance with the 
P/O's shipping instructions. 
 
¶Q. If so, can Elbit confirm that all the provisos attached to 
the license were fulfilled?  More specifically, can Elbit 
confirm that U.S.-origin ECCM/frequency hopping algorithms 
were not released to a third party? 
 
¶A. ESL believes that all the provisos attached to the License 
were fulfilled.  Specifically, upon becoming aware of the 
License's provisos, the P/O was revised to eliminate the IIQ 
and the SATURN (corresponding to the Have Quick IIA and 
secured radio).  Moreover, the P/O does not call for release 
of U.S. origin ECCM/frequency hopping algorithms. 
 
¶Q. Additionally, please confirm that none of the following 
was released to a third-party entity:  (a) USG datalink 
message standards/formats; (b) Have Quick IIA; and (c) the 
USG version of the SINCGARS. 
 
¶A. We can confirm that the above items were not included in 
the P/O's scope and were not released. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Elbit Systems, Ltd. confirmed in writing that the 
items detailed in the License and the above question were 
delivered in the form of shipsets containing each of the 
above items, as follows:  (a) 1st through 4th shipset -- 
fully delivered; (b) 5th through 7th shipset -- delivery 
scheduled as per the P/O for November 2007. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Ilan Mazushan of MALMAB/DSDE and Ofer Meishar of 
Elbit Systems, Ltd. were copied on the written response sent 
through Rami Yungman at the MOD.
