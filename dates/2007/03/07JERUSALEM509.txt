¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  Construction of the donor-financed 
Northern Gaza Wastewater Treatment Plant (NGWTP) began in 
February.  The plant's new storage lagoon began receiving 
wastewater from the nearby Beit Lahiya sewage lake in early 
March in order to provide relief to the area's overflowing 
sewage system.  Previously, the Beit Lahiya sewage lake's 
effluent seeped into residential areas, and contaminated the 
coastal aquifer, according to World Bank officials and 
Gaza-based USAID staff.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The World Bank, European Commission, European 
Investment Bank, Sweden, France, Belgium and the PA are 
financing the USD 52 million NGWTP project.  The NGWTP will 
serve roughly 350,000 Gaza residents when it is completed in 
three years.  Deputy World Bank Country Director Faris 
Hadad-Zervos told Econoff on March 12 that the plant's 
construction began in February following months of 
negotiations between the Israeli Coordinator for Government 
Activities in the Territories (COGAT), the Palestinian Water 
Authority (PWA), and donors.  He stated that a deal was 
reached between PWA and COGAT that allows the project's 
construction materials to be imported through Karni as long 
as the PWA provides COGAT with a daily report of all 
construction activities. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) According to Hadad-Zervos, the plant's new lagoon 
began receiving wastewater pumped from the Beit Lahiya sewage 
lake on March 3.  The start of this effluent transfer was 
postponed on several occasions in 2006 due to Israeli 
military operations in Gaza, which delayed the lagoon's 
completion (reftel), according to Hadad-Zervos.  The lagoon's 
nine cisterns and pumps - located two kilometers east of the 
Beit Lahiya lake - began storing Gaza wastewater and reducing 
the lake's effluent level.  Heavy rains had caused sewage 
overflow and leakage from the Beit Lahiya sewage lake into 
nearby residential areas in February, causing epidermal 
diseases and parasites in residents, according to Hari 
Al-Jamal, the World Bank representative in Gaza. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The Beit Lahiya sewage lake was dug by the GOI in 
1976 to serve a population of 30,000 residents, but in 2007 
it serves over 200,000 Gazans.  Once the NGWTP is opened, the 
lake will receive little new wastewater, as most effluent 
will be pumped directly to the new treatment plant, according 
to Al-Jamal.  He stated that the Beit Lahiya lake is likely 
contaminating the coastal aquifer due to seapage of 
insufficiently treated sewage.  He said that the risk of 
aquifer contamination is reduced greatly as effluent levels 
are lowered.
