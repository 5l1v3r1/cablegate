Polchief conveyed reftel points to Oussama Khacchab, Americas 
desk officer at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Khacchab, 
whose duties lately have included regional security issues, 
reported that the GOL would not send representatives to the 
March 10 Prepcon.  He confirmed though that the GOL supports 
USG and regional participation in the conference.  The GOL 
views the conference as a positive step that has the 
potential to build confidence and communication among parties 
in a position to help solve other regional issues, including 
Lebanon's political crisis.
