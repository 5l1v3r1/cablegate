¶1.  (SBU) This message contains an action request at para. 2. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) China is pleased to see expansion of the Global 
Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism and particularly 
welcomes the announcement that Ukraine has joined the 
Initiative, MFA Arms Control Department official Yu Dunhai 
told poloff March 20.  China believes expansion of the 
Initiative is very important and would like to see an agenda 
for the next meeting in Kazakhstan, scheduled for June, which 
aims to focus on expansion of the Initiative, Yu said.  China 
would like to know whether any countries were excluded from 
the recent invitation to join the Global Initiative, how many 
countries will join and what the agenda is for the June 
meeting in Kazakhstan.  ACTION REQUEST:  Please send guidance 
to respond to China's questions. 
 
¶3. (BU) Poloff reminded the MFA officials of an upcoming 
March 30 deadline to submit China's delegation list for an 
FBI-sponsored Global Initiative training in Miami (ref C). 
Poloff advised that officials from United States' expert 
agencies may be in direct touch with their Chinese 
counterparts to inform them about the training.  Yu said 
China has not yet decided whether to send an MFA official on 
the delegation or whether it will send an all-expert 
delegation.  Yu requested that the Embassy advise the MFA 
which ministries and officials it contacts directly so that 
their applications to participate on the Chinese delegation 
can be properly considered and coordinated.
