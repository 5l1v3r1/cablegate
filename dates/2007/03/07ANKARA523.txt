 (SBU)  We delivered reftel points on the Joint DOD-DOE 
Nuclear Weapons Council determination on the development of 
Reliable Replacement Warheads (RRW) on March 2 to Melih Bora 
Kerimoglu, Chief of Section, MFA Department of Arms Control 
and Disarmament.  Kerimoglu expressed appreciation for our 
notification before the decision was made public.  He asked 
whether we intended to test the RRW.  Drawing from reftel Q 
and A, we explained that while we do not intend to conduct 
underground tests of the new warheads at this time, we could 
not rule out the possibility of future tests.
