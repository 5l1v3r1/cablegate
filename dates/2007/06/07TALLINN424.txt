¶9. SECURITY ASSESSMENT: Estonia is a relatively safe 
country although crime in the old city is an ongoing 
concern.  Visitors should take reasonable precautions 
when visiting as crime, mainly pick pocketing, car 
break-in and car theft, continues to be a problem. 
During the summer tourist season, the risk of personal 
crimes against official and unofficial Americans sharply 
increases.  There have been several incidents of crimes 
involving force reported by the international community, 
mainly at night or in the early morning hours.  After 
dark, visitors should exercise common sense and avoid 
isolated areas.  In public places, such as the airport, 
train stations and the central market, one must exercise 
special care in safeguarding valuables against purse 
snatchers and pickpockets.  Valuables should never be 
left unattended in vehicles and car doors should be kept 
locked at all times.  Post recommends that visitors 
carry only a minimal amount of cash, credit cards and 
identification, and leave valuables at home.  Additional 
information about the security situation is available by 
calling the RSO at +372 668-8118.
