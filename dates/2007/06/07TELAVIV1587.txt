¶1. Mideast 
 
¶2. Iran

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Ha'aretz reported that Israel is waiting for Hamas to forward it 
another list of Palestinian prisoners whom it proposes to exchange 
for kidnapped IDF soldier Gilad Shalit. The paper noted that Israel 
rejected most of the names suggested by Hamas two months ago. 
Ha'aretz cited security sources as saying that the deal is being 
postponed due to the escalation in violence the Gaza Strip. 
 
Leading media reported that in a report submitted to the Congress 
and State Department by Lt. Gen. Keith Dayton, the top American 
security envoy to the Palestinian Authority, he criticized Israel 
for its failure to help define a 'security horizon' for the 
Palestinians and its refusal to ease conditions in the Palestinian 
Authority. 
 
Ha'aretz reported that Prime Minister Ehud Olmert will meet US 
President George Bush on June 19, 2007 in Washington. According to 
the paper, Olmert will try to use the US trip as an opportunity to 
change the agenda in Israel from domestic politics to progress on 
the diplomatic front. 
 
Ha'aretz reported that according to IDF sources the main reason that 
Israel does not want to start a ground operation in the Gaza Strip 
is fear that a war with Syria might break out in the summer. 
 
Maariv reported that the largest organization of civil servants in 
Britain, UNISON, will decide on June 19 whether to impose an 
economic and cultural boycott on Israel. 
 
Leading media reported that Fatah and Hamas are scheduled to meet in 
Cairo to discuss a cease fire with Israel and how to lower tensions 
between the two parties.  According to the Jerusalem Post, three 
other Palestinian factions have also sent representatives to the 
Cairo talks. 
All media reported that 100 IDF combat reservists who live in Sderot 
told PM Olmert that they will not do any reserve time as long as 
Qassam rockets are being fired at Israel. 
 
Israel Radio reported that a first sign of life of British reporter 
Alan Johnston was published Friday in a video posted on an Islamic 
militant Web site. In the video Johnston said he is being treated 
well and calls for the lifting of international sanctions against 
the Palestinian government. 
 
The Lebanese Minister of Communications, Marwan Hamadah, was quoted 
as saying in an interview with Nazareth-based Arabic-language 
Assennara, following the Security Council decision to create an 
international court to try the murderers of former Lebanese Prime 
Minister Hariri, that such a decision protects the sovereignty of 
Lebanon and prevents interference from Syria. 
 
The media coordinator for Hamas in Lebanon, Rafat Morra, was quoted 
as saying in an interview with Arab-language Kul Al Arab that the 
number of Palestinians in Fateh Al Islam is just 20 of 300 members. 
The Palestinians in Lebanon are not responsible for Fateh Al Islam's 
entrance into the Naher Al Bared camp. The Palestinian refugees live 
in a miserable situation and most have fled to Al Badawi camp.

¶1. Mideast:

Summary: 
-------- 
 
Senior columnist and longtime dove Yoel Marcus wrote in the 
independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz: "If the political deck is 
reshuffled and an experienced defense minister is appointed, this 
could provide Olmert with the push he needs to get started on a 
political initiative based on the Saudi plan, in cooperation with 
U.S. President George W. Bush, and seriously explore the messages 
that are secretly passing back and forth between Syria and Israel."

"A Stronger Government" 
 
Senior columnist and longtime dove Yoel Marcus wrote in the 
independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz (06/01): "The way things look 
now, not only will the Olmert administration stay put for another 
year, at least, but it could grow stronger if two heavyweights like 
Barak and Ayalon -- the general and the admiral, as Peretz 
sneeringly calls them -- are brought in.  If the political deck is 
reshuffled and an experienced defense minister is appointed, this 
could provide Olmert with the push he needs to get started on a 
political initiative based on the Saudi plan, in cooperation with 
U.S. President George W. Bush, and seriously explore the messages 
that are secretly passing back and forth between Syria and Israel."

¶2. Iran: 
-------- 
 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Herb Keinon wrote in the conservative, 
independent Jerusalem Post: "When Mofaz and Burns meet in 
Washington, they will still focus on trying to get to Iran's brain 
through the pocketbook. But unless the Iranians show some sign of 
stepping down, their next meeting -- at the strategic dialogue 
planned for the winter -- might very well concentrate on dealing 
with other options altogether."

"Exhausting Efforts" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Herb Keinon wrote in the conservative, 
independent Jerusalem Post (06/01): "Sderot is bleeding in the 
basement, the Arab Peace Initiative is resting on the living-room 
table, and the idea of talks with Syria is again crawling in through 
the attic window. But when the US and Israel sit down in Washington 
on Thursday for another round of strategic talks, the only real 
focus will be on the one real threat to the entire house: Iran.... 
Israel and the US are, for the most part, on the same page regarding 
Iran and the steps that now need to be taken.  Yet there still 
remains one real point of disagreement, and that has to do with the 
time line.... The time line is obviously key in determining when to 
throw up one's hands and say that the diplomatic process has been 
exhausted, and that there is now no other choice but to act 
militarily.  That point has not yet arrived -- and when Mofaz and 
Burns meet in Washington, they will still focus on trying to get to 
Iran's brain through the pocketbook. But unless the Iranians show 
 
 
some sign of stepping down, their next meeting -- at the strategic 
dialogue planned for the winter -- might very well concentrate on 
dealing with other options altogether."
