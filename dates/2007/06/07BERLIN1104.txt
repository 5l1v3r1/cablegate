SUBJECT: German Government Welcomes Zoellick 
World Bank Nomination 
 
REF: SECSTATE 73691 
 
¶1.  Germany welcomed President Bush's May 30 
nomination of Robert Zoellick to be President of 
the World Bank.  On behalf of Chancellor Merkel 
(CDU), Minister for Economic Cooperation and 
Development, Heidi Wieczorek-Zeul (SPD), praised 
the choice and described Zoellick as a "good 
candidate who would come to the World Bank with a 
high degree of international experience."  She 
added that Germany would look forward to 
"dialogue with [Zoellick] and the other 
representatives of the World Bank on the future 
of the institution and the challenges it faces." 
Wieczorek-Zeul specifically mentioned the fight 
against poverty, the implementation of the 
Millennium Development Goals, and efforts to 
combat climate change as issues facing the next 
World Bank president.  Recently, the Development 
Minister, who also serves as Germany's World Bank 
Governor, stressed that Germany would look to the 
Bank to take active steps on new debt relief 
initiatives for African countries. 
 
¶2.  Press reports indicate that Zoellick's 
nomination received strong public support from 
German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck (SPD). 
Contacts in the Minister's office privately 
confirmed to Emboff that Steinbrueck had 
responded favorably to requests from many 
European ambassadors in Berlin who had sought his 
assessment.  The Foreign Ministry additionally 
welcomed the nomination.  Karsten Voigt, the 
Ministry's Coordinator for German-U.S. relations, 
praised the announcement in press interviews. 
(Note: MFA contacts privately informed Emboff 
that the government plans to emphasize publicly 
that Zoellick is one of the few U.S. recipients 
of the Federal President's Cross of Merit, Star 
Class ("Bundesverdienstkreuz mit Stern") --  the 
nation's most prestigious award.  End note.) 
 
¶3.  Wieczorek-Zeul's warm welcome to Zoellick 
comes in the wake of her harsh criticism of 
outgoing World Bank President Wolfowitz. 
Wieczorek-Zeul took a public stance against 
Wolfowitz remaining at the helm of the World Bank 
following allegations of ethical misconduct.  In 
recent weeks, she used numerous public fora to 
emphasize the need she saw for strong leadership 
at the top of the institution which she felt 
Wolfowitz could no longer guarantee.  On May 16, 
Wieczorek-Zeul publicly announced that she had 
effectively rescinded his invitation to the G- 
8/World Bank forum later that month in Berlin.
