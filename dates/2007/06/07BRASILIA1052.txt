SUBJECT: POSSIBLE U.S.-BRAZIL COOPERATION ON WATER RESOURCES ISSUES 
 
REF:  BRASILIA 0144 
 
¶1.  As discussed in reftel, Brazil's Ministry of the Environment has 
proposed discussions to investigate the possibility of bilateral 
technical cooperation in water resource issues. 
 
¶2.  As this is the first area of proposed cooperation where there is 
bilateral agreement since the establishment of the Common Agenda for 
the Environment (CAE) Technical Working Group, it might serve as the 
topic around which we can hold our first DVC.  Post is proposing a 
DVC through which Brazilian technical experts and representatives 
from U.S. technical agencies could exchange information to identify 
areas of common interest. 
 
¶3.  Per reftel, Post is presenting a summary of the areas of 
possible cooperation in water management issues.  The specific 
topics were suggested by Brazil's Water Resources Secretariat (SRH) 
and their National Water Agency (ANA), but presented to us by the 
Ministry of the Environment. A DVC would be useful in allowing the 
SRH and ANA representatives to further detail their objectives and 
USG technical agencies would be able to solicit the additional 
information necessary to later ascertain their ability or desire to 
collaborate. 
 
¶4.  AREAS OF POSSIBLE BILATERAL COOPERATION IN 
WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT: (a)process of elaboration of basin 
committees (b)relationship between federal and state level 
authorities in water resources issues (c)legal aspects of mineral 
and underground water (d) the management of borderline water 
resources (e) desalinization of brackish underground water for 
supply (f) procedures for preventing problems in underground water 
(g) evaluation of potential for small hydro electric plants (h) 
removing pollution from rivers; and (i) modeling for the measurement 
of transport of sediment in rivers. 
 
¶5.  Training in mapping and predicting critical events, development 
of hydrological applications, development of sensing technology and 
measurements would also be discussed. 
 
¶6.  If subsequently there is bilateral agreement on areas for 
collaboration, a summary could be reported to the CAE technical 
working group. 
 
¶7.  Post awaits Department's advice and suggested June date for DVC.
