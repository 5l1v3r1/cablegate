¶1.  This is an Action Request.  Please see final para. 
 
¶2.  Emboff met Riyadh-based Nepalese Charge d'Affaires Prakash 
Suvedi at his request on May 28, 2007 to discuss allegations of 
non-payment of death benefits by companies operating in Iraq for the 
USG.  He requested any assistance the USG could offer. 
 
¶3.  Mr. Suvedi presented the Embassy with a diplomatic note No. 
DM/255 which reads as follows: 
 
The Embassy of Nepal in Riyadh, which is concurrently accredited to 
the State of Kuwait, presents its compliments to the Embassy of the 
United States of America in Kuwait and has the honour to state that 
the family members of the following Nepalese nationals who were 
killed while serving presumably under US contracts in Iraq have been 
approaching this Embassy with their request to provide them with 
compensation and insurance.

However, the Embassy has been facing difficulties to contact and 
deal with these companies operating inside Iraq.  In view of this 
problem as well as considering the trauma the bereaved families are 
undergoing with the death of their breadwinners, the Embassy would 
like to request the esteemed Embassy of the United States in Kuwait 
to kindly instruct the concerned companies to pay immediately 
through this Embassy legitimate dues, compensation and insurance 
that the legal heirs of the deceased may be entitled to under the 
prevailing laws and regulations.  If the family of some of those 
Nepalese nationals are already paid by the concerned company 
directly, the Embassy would like to get documents confirming such 
payments. 
 
In the meantime, all contractors of the Government of the United 
States should be informed to use the official channel while paying 
any dues, compensation and insurance money to the family in case of 
any death of a Nepali national under their sponsorship. 
 
[Complimentary close.] 
 
¶4.  Accompanying the dipnote was a dossier with copies of DD Form 
1075 (Convoy List of Remains of Deceased Personnel), DD Form 2064 
(Certificate of Death (Overseas)), DD Form 890 (Record of 
Identification Processing), CAC and CPA ID cards, passport biodata 
pages, various correspondence, insurance policies, a DNA test 
report, etc. of the deceased listed above.  A review of the files 
reveals that nearly all of the deceased persons were killed by 
insurgent attacks (IEDs, gunfire, rocket fire, etc.) 
 
¶5.  Kishor Rai (number 14 in dipnote) should read Kishwar RAI per 
his DoD Contractor ID card issued 2004JUN07. 
 
¶6.  Not listed in the dipnote, but included as a file was a power of 
attorney for the legal heirs of Agam Bahadur ADHIKARI, deceased 26 
June 2005, a truck driver, possibly with Rehal International. 
 
¶7.  Mr. Suvedi asked the USG to apply "moral pressure" on 
contractors to pay these claims.  Emboff offered his sympathy and 
said he would forward the diplomatic note to Washington. 
 
¶8.  ACTION REQUEST:  Please advise post on appropriate response to 
the Embassy of Nepal's diplomatic note.  POC is John Higi, 
Management Officer, Iraq Support Unit Kuwait.
