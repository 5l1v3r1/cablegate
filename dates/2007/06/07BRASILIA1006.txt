Update on GOL-Legacy Crash Legal Case Ref: Brasilia 600 and previous 1. (SBU) Summary: In a surprise move, the Brazilian federal prosecutor in charge of the criminal investigation into the September 29 air collision between a business jet and GOL airliner indicted four air traffic controllers for the accident, one on serious charges of having acted deliberately. The federal police investigation had only recommended the indictment of the U.S. citizen pilots of the business jet. The prosecutor indicted the pilots, and three other controllers, on less serious charges. The federal judge in charge of the case accepted the indictments and set dates for questioning of the defendants on August 27 and 28. It is unclear whether the U.S. pilots will be required to return for testimony. The accusations against the controllers were repeated in Brazilian Senate committee hearings on the accident and caused a sea change in press reporting on the issue. End Summary.
