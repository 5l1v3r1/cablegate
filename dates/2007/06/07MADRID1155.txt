 EconOff delivered reftel points June 11 to MFA's Deputy 
Director for Economic Multilateral Relations on Maritime and 
Land Juan Luis Munoz de Laborde.  EconOff explained that 
President Bush had urged the Senate to take affirmative 
action in approving the United Nations Convention on the Law 
of the Sea, and that Senator Biden had expressed his 
intention to review this treaty in the near future.  Munoz de 
Laborde said that this was positive news for Spain and 
represented an important step forward. He said that he looked 
forward to potential approval by the Senate in the upcoming 
months.
