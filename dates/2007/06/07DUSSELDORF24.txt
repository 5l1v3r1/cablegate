¶1.  (U) Almost eleven months after two Lebanese nationals 
unsuccessfully tried to blow up two regional trains originating 
in Cologne, the Federal Public Prosecutor on June 11 brought 
criminal charges against one of the men, Youssef Mohammad 
El-Hajdib.  German police arrested the 22-year old El-Hajdib in 
August 2006 and he has been in pre-trial detention ever since. 
(The other suspect, Jihad Hamad, a former resident of Cologne, 
escaped to Lebanon and was to face trial there).  Prosecutors 
charged El-Hajdib with multiple counts of attempted murder for 
placing one of the suitcases containing IEDs on a train July 31, 
¶2006.  The Federal Prosecutor said El-Hajdib was attempting to 
retaliate for the publication of the controversial Mohammed 
caricatures some German newspapers republished earlier that 
year.  The bombs did not go off due to a technical failure, the 
Prosecutor reported. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Before the trial can begin, the court must approve the 
indictment, which -- due to the current court recess -- is 
unlikely before September.  The presiding judge dealing with the 
train bomber case told the CG June 22 that the trial itself 
would probably not open until the end of 2007 because the court 
is handling another major terrorist trial involving al-Qaida 
supporters Iraqi National Ibrahim Mohamed Khalil and Palestinian 
brothers Yasser Abu Shaweesh and Ismail Abu Shaweesh (reftel) 
and is expecting a verdict to that case this fall. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The President of the Higher Regional Court of 
Duesseldorf and the head judge who will likely preside over this 
case told us this court was chosen because of the North 
Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) connection and the court's experience and 
expertise in terrorism trials. 
 
¶4.  (U) This message was coordinated with Embassy Berlin.
