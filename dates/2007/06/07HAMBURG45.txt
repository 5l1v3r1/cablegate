¶1. (U) On June 18, the Bremen Social Democratic Party (SPD) and 
Green Party presented their coalition agreement for governing 
the city-state of Bremen/Bremerhaven.  The agreement, which was 
completed on June 16 - five weeks after the May 13 elections, is 
based upon three pillars; strengthening Bremen as an economic 
power, upgrading the city-state's social cohesion and equality 
of opportunities, and safeguarding Bremen's autonomy.  The 
Bremen SPD will hold a party convention on June 23 to approve 
the new agreement and the Bremen Greens will hold their 
convention on June 25. 
 
¶2. (U) The city-state will continue to have a seven-person 
cabinet, now with four SPD senators, two Green senators and one 
independent.  Jens Boehrnsen (SPD) will remain Bremen's Minister 
President (President of the Senate) and Mayor.  Boehrnsen will 
also be responsible for federal and cultural affairs.  He handed 
off his justice portfolio to the new Economics Senator, Ulrich 
Nussbaum.  Nussbaum, who is an independent, comes from a 
business background in Bremerhaven.  Current Senator for 
Education Willi Lemke (SPD) will become Senator for the Interior 
and the previous Minister for Culture in Lower Saxony Renate 
Juergens-Pieper (SPD) will take over the education portfolio. 
Ingelore Rosenkoetter (SPD) will remain Senator for Social 
Affairs.  Head of the Green Party Caucus Karoline Linnert will 
take on the responsibility for Bremen's finances and the 
Bundestag Member and economist Reinhard Loske (Greens) will 
become the Senator for Construction, Environment, and 
Transportation. 
 
¶3. (U) This message has been coordinated with Embassy Berlin.
