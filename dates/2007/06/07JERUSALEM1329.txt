Haniyah's Speech 
---------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) Former Prime Minister Ismail Haniyah on June 24 spoke 
for nearly two hours at a rally in Gaza and told Palestinians 
that their main conflict is with Israel.  He accused Israel 
of working to deepen the divide between Palestinian factions 
by restricting movement from Gaza and by releasing clearance 
revenues only to the West Bank.  He dismissed the June 25 
Sharm al-Sheikh summit among President Mahmud Abbas (Abu 
Mazen), Israeli Prime Minister Olmert, Jordanian King 
Abdullah, and Egyptian President Mubarak and insisted only 
resistance will restore Palestinians' rights and lands. 
Haniyah extended his criticism to the U.S. when he suggested 
that the Palestinians who undermined the national unity 
government (NUG) are working toward U.S. objectives. 
 
¶3.  (U) Haniyah said the problem is not between HAMAS and 
Abbas or HAMAS and Fatah, but he blamed a "trend" in Fatah 
for emphasizing its own interests over general Palestinian 
well-being.  (NOTE:  Palestinian press are linking this 
"treasonous trend" with Muhammad Dahlan, but Haniyah did not 
name names in his speech.  END NOTE.)  He reiterated that 
Fatah members and institutions in Gaza are not at risk from 
HAMAS, but said HAMAS intends to prosecute criminals, 
regardless of their factional affiliation.  Haniyah said 
HAMAS's take-over of Gaza was a preemptive strike in response 
to the pressure on HAMAS related to international 
restrictions, the arrest of PLC members, and Fatah attacks 
against HAMAS personnel and interests.  He displayed at the 
rally a letter that he said had sent to Abbas detailing 
violations of the Mecca Agreement and warning of Fatah's 
"planned explosion," which he said HAMAS's take-over of Gaza 
was intended to prevent. 
 
¶4.  (U) Haniyah praised HAMAS's refusal to surrender to the 
international financial blockade and willingness to work with 
other Palestinian factions in the NUG.  He rejected the word 
"coup" to describe HAMAS's actions.  HAMAS came to power 
through elections, Haniyah stated, and HAMAS acted to protect 
its legitimacy in Gaza.  Since the take-over, Gaza has become 
more secure than before, Haniyah said.  He reassured Gazans 
that their isolation will end and HAMAS will seek to pay PA 
employee salaries.  He denied reports that HAMAS intends to 
establish an independent Islamic emirate in Gaza, criticized 
Abbas's decree to form a new government as illegal and 
claimed that Abbas's actions will deepen the divide between 
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. 
 
¶5.  (U) Haniyah read a ten point proposal to end the current 
crisis, which included establishing a new NUG for all the 
Palestinian territories, restructuring the security services, 
ending the anti-HAMAS practices in the West Bank, and holding 
those who committed crimes during the clashes accountable. 
He also reassured Christians that HAMAS will look after their 
interests and denied that HAMAS was responsible for the 
looting of a Christian school in Gaza.  Additionally, Haniyah 
described the "Dayton Plan" as undermining security reform 
efforts.  He also criticized Abbas for using PLO committees 
to rubber stamp his policies and denied that HAMAS had formed 
an axis with Iran and Syria. 
 
PLO-EC Member in Gaza 
--------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) PLO Executive Committee (PLO-EC) member Riad 
al-Khodary told PolOff in a telephone conversation from Gaza 
that Gazans had listened to Haniyah's speech with great 
interest.  Palestinians had hoped for more concrete steps, 
and everyone in Gaza wonders what will happen next.  Khodary 
said business seems to have returned to normal and people are 
moving safely through the streets, but he does not believe 
the situation is tenable.  He said he feels that Gazans are 
on edge, waiting to see what Haniyah and HAMAS will do after 
the speech.
