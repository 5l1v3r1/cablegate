¶1. (U) A month-long disagreement between the Government of 
Jordan and the Greek Orthodox Church ended on June 12.  Local 
media reported that the GOJ reversed its May 12 decision to 
withdraw recognition of Patriarch Theophilos III of the Greek 
Orthodox Church in Jerusalem (ref b).  At a June 12 press 
conference, Government Spokesman Nasser Judeh explained that 
"the cabinet has become convinced that Theophilos has honored 
all the commitments he undertook when he was appointed as 
patriarch in 2005." 
 
¶2. (U) The cabinet's decision came after Theophilos wrote two 
letters to Jordanian Prime Minister Marouf Bakhit, and issued 
a statement confirming that no church lands were sold under 
his tenure.  The decision was announced just in advance of a 
June 12 visit to Amman by Greek FM Dora Bakoyannis. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Dr. Raouf Abu Jaber, Chairman of the Orthodox 
Society in Amman, told poloff that the Arab Orthodox 
community was displeased with Theophilos' leadership and news 
of the GOJ reversal.  Abu Jaber said that Arab Orthodox 
Christians resent the lack of Arab - specifically Jordanian - 
membership in the Holy Synod and Brotherhood of the Holy 
Sepulcher (ref A).  He accused the Greek Government of 
exerting pressure on the GOJ and the Palestinian Authority to 
recognize Theophilos.  Abu Jaber remains convinced that "the 
monks in Greece" - as he refers to the Holy Synod -- care 
only about the profits they make from the church's lands in 
Jerusalem.  COMMENT: In fact, Jordan's Arab Orthodox 
community is split into pro- and anti-Theophilos camps.  END 
COMMENT.
