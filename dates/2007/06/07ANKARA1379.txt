¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Following up on Secretary Rice's March message 
to FM Gul promising participation by a senior State Department 
official in the June 25 BSEC Summit in Istanbul (ref B) is an 
important opportunity to emphasize USG support for BSEC and our 
bigger objective of encouraging economic and political growth and 
diversification in the Black Sea region.  Turkey is working with us 
to reinvigorate the organization, including by holding a seminar on 
environmental pollution in the Black Sea.  A visit to Turkey by a 
senior official would also be an opportunity to support the 
U.S.-Turkey relationship and shared interests during a testing time 
in other areas.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The June 25 BSEC Summit in Istanbul will be the flagship 
activity of Turkey's BSEC Chairmanship that began May 1.  In 
addition to formal meeting sessions, member country heads of state 
and observer country foreign ministers are invited to a luncheon 
hosted by PM Erdogan and dinner hosted by President Sezer. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  There will also be multiple opportunities for bilateral 
meetings.  The BSEC Secretariat and Turkish MFA have not yet 
confirmed other participation, but press reports say Russian 
President Putin, Greek Prime Minister Karamanlis, and Azeri 
President Aliyev will attend.  Ankara-based Embassies confirmed 
attendance of Ukrainian President Yushchenko, Ukrainian Foreign 
Minister Yatseniuk, Bulgarian President Purvanov, and Bulgarian 
Foreign Minister Kalfin.  We would expect high level participation 
from Georgia and Armenia, but no confirmations were available. 
Embassy will provide more specific information on attendance as it 
becomes available. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Participation by a senior Washington-based official would 
recognize the United States' new observer status and our interest in 
contributing to revitalizing BSEC during Turkey's Chairmanship. 
This would boost this organization aimed at fostering economic 
linkages and cooperation in this challenging region.  By helping 
Turkey build common ground during its chairmanship, we can help pull 
BSEC more together and towards the Atlantic community.  It would 
also support the U.S.-proposed BSEC "Environmental Protection for 
Economic Growth Symposium" that will be held September 12-13 in 
Istanbul. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  Finally, visible U.S. support to BSEC would contribute to 
our bilateral agenda with Turkey by showing our support for its 
efforts to foster a more self-reliant region that is oriented to the 
west and less vulnerable to outside pressure.
