¶1. Arab League foreign ministers, meeting late on June 15 at 
AL headquarters in Cairo, addressed Lebanon in addition to 
their previously-scheduled Hamas agenda at the request of PM 
Siniora.  The AL statement (full text paragraph 2) condemns 
the assassination of Lebanese MP Walid Eido, offers 
yet-unspecified assistance to the LAF in controlling the 
Lebanese-Syrian border, and announces a "high-level 
delegation" to meet with Lebanese political figures in the 
coming month.  Chief of Staff to the AL SYG Hisham Youssef 
stressed the AL's border security assistance offer during a 
June 18 briefing to the diplomatic corps and said that the 
Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and Qatar representatives would be at 
the minister of state level while Egypt would be represented 
by an MFA U/S-equivalent.  Youssef did not rule out a visit 
to Damascus when asked by poloff.  SYG Amr Moussa departs for 
Beirut on June 19 to lay the groundwork for this effort.
