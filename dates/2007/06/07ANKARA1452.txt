SUBJECT: ANKARA MEDIA REACTION REPORT 
FRIDAY, JUNE 8, 2007 
 
 
In Today's Papers 
 
Tension on the Iraqi Border 
All papers report that tension remains high on Turkey-Iraq border 
while the Turkish military increases security measures against 
further infiltration of the PKK.  Commenting on the media reports of 
a cross-border operation, Chief of the Turkish General Staff (TGS) 
General Yasar Buyukanit said "we need a government decision for an 
operation. The Turkish military is not the neighborhood bully" and 
reiterated the Turkish military's determination in the fight against 
terrorism. Meanwhile, in a statement posted on its website last 
night, the TGS drew attention to increased terror attacks in recent 
days and called on the Turkish nation to display a "mass resistance 
against terrorism." 
 
Mainstream Milliyet, leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet and others 
report that Kurdish leaders Barzani and Talabani held a press 
conference in Suleymaniye in Northern Iraq yesterday and said that 
they would consider "any Turkish incursion into Northern Iraq as an 
attack against the whole of Iraq."  Barzani added "Ankara asks us to 
launch an operation against the PKK, but we will not fight with the 
PKK, we want a peaceful solution to the issue." 
 
Meanwhile, outlets report that four soldiers were killed and six 
were injured when a remote-control land mine went off as military 
vehicles carrying reinforcement troops were driving on the 
Siirt-Sirvan highway in the southeast. 
 
Editorial Comment: Stopping the PKK 
Hakan Celik writes in the tabloid daily Posta:  "The US encourages 
the trilateral mechanism between Turkey, the US and Iraq for the 
settlement of the PKK problem and is opposed to a cross-border 
operation.  One wonders what good can come out of the trilateral 
mechanism while Barzani and Talabani decline to fight against the 
PKK.  The current situation poses a deadlock, and it is the US 
administration's responsibility to break it by taking immediate and 
concrete measures.  Otherwise the developments in the region will 
spin out of Washington's control." 
 
Sami Kohen writes in the mainstream daily Milliyet:  "Turkish 
diplomacy has intensified its efforts to make others aware of the 
PKK terrorism issue and to gain support for the struggle against 
terrorism.  Recently there has been a series of meetings arranged by 
Turkish diplomats in the international arena -- from NATO to the 
United Nations -- who have explained Turkey's suffering from 
terrorism, emphasized the role of Northern Iraq in Turkey's 
terrorism problem and also asked for international support. Turkish 
Foreign Ministry officials bring up the same subjects with 
counterparts every time they go to a foreign country.  The leaders 
of Turkey-friendly countries should go beyond the 'we are with you' 
rhetoric.  Action that validates their empathy is needed.  Otherwise 
they might end up getting some unwanted surprises given the fact 
that even a small story about a military operation is enough to 
create a frenzy." 
 
 
DP-ANAP Cooperation 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Zaman, Yeni Safak and others:  The 
Democrat Party (DP) and Anavatan Party (ANAP), having failed in 
their attempts to create an alliance earlier, decided to revive the 
unification process.  ANAP will not officially participate in the 
elections but will run under the DP ticket and ANAP leader Erkan 
Mumcu will not be a candidate. 
 
Sarkozy Attempt to Block Turkey's EU Entry 
Sabah, Cumhuriyet, Vatan and others:  In an interview with Le Figaro 
daily, French President Nicolas Sarkozy  said that he had not 
changed his mind; Turkey has no place in Europe.  Reportedly, 
Sarkozy will propose a strategy at the EU summit in December aimed 
at ending Turkey's EU membership bid.

President Sezer Vetoes Parts of Foreign Work Permit Law 
Sabah, Cumhuriyet:  President Sezer vetoed two provisions of a bill 
permitting foreigners to work in Turkey.  Sezer said "considering 
that the amendment encourages foreigners to work in fields that 
don't relate to their specializations and that this in turn will 
contribute to the longstanding problem of unemployment in Turkey, it 
has been determined that the amendment doesn't fit with the 
constitutional rules and public interest."
