¶1. (U)  Action request, please see paragraph 3. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  On June 22, econoff discussed reftel with Zakia 
Midaoui, Director of the MFA's Division of Economic and 
Commercial Organizations and Conferences.  Midaoui reported 
that in March 2006 Morocco and several other African 
countries signed a memorandum of understanding pledging 
unspecified support for UNITAID.  Since then the GOM has 
taken little, if any action on this issue.  The Ministry of 
Transportation (MOT) has been hesitant to institute a tax on 
airline tickets to raise funds for UNITAID.  Midaoui reported 
that the MOT, the Ministry of Finance and Royal Air Maroc 
plan to meet in the fall to discuss the issue.  She also 
noted that UNITAID had suggested a tax on jet fuel in lieu of 
a tax on tickets, but was not aware of other options 
available to UNITAID signatories to raise funds.  Midaoui was 
very interested in USG ideas for raising funds to combat AIDS 
and asked if Washington could supply her with examples.  She 
requested to receive these ideas by June 29 in order to 
distribute them to other relevant GOM offices prior to the 
summer vacation season.  Midaoui stated that the GOM "did not 
have any ideas" of its own to replace the tax on airline 
tickets supported by France. 
 
¶3. (U)  Action request: Post requests the Department send 
examples of USG ideas on alternative means of raising funds 
for UNITAID.  The GOM appears willing to listen to USG 
concerns but requests alternative fund raising ideas.  Please 
send ideas by June 29.  Assistance appreciated.
