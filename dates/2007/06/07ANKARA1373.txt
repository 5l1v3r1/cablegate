GEN SAYGUN 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: Deputy Chief of Defense General Ergin 
Saygun briefed Codels Nelson and Whitfield on May 28 on 
Turkey's contributions to regional peace and stability.  He 
complained that some European nations were seeking to 
re-define trans-Atlantic security at NATO's expense.  He 
described the situation in Iraq as the greatest security 
challenge and "the executive summary of the Middle East." 
Partition of Iraq would be a disaster, he stressed; the 
coalition should seek to make all parties to the conflict 
there "equally happy or unhappy."  He criticized creation of 
a de facto Kurdish state and accused Iraq Kurd leader Barzani 
of supporting PKK terrorism.  He said Turkey cooperates with 
Iran on border security against the PKK but will support the 
international community's efforts to prevent Iran from 
developing a nuclear weapon.  Syria needs a "helping hand" to 
separate Basher from hard line Baathists in his government 
and Iran's embrace. He reaffirmed Turkish support for Israel, 
with which Turkey shares common regional challenges.  Saygun 
said Congressional passage of an Armenian genocide resolution 
would hurt Turkey.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Using a powerpoint presentation, Saygun highlighted 
Turkish contributions to NATO missions in Afghanistan and the 
Balkans, its support to UNIFIL, and its assistance to 
humanitarian missions in Africa.  He underlined Turkey's 
troop contributions to the NATO Reaction Force (NRF), 
including its leadership of NRF 8.  He described threats to 
NATO from some European countries who are seeking to 
re-define trans-Atlantic security, mentioning France's 
objections to NATO's engagement out of area.  He complained 
that Turkey feels as if it must defend NATO against some of 
its own members.  He noted, however, that NATO has not 
identified the PKK as a terrorist organization, although the 
EU has. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Saygun described the situation in Iraq as the 
pre-eminent security challenge in the region.  Iraq is the 
"executive summary of the Middle East," he asserted, 
lamenting the sectarian divisions plaguing the region.  the 
Baghdad government appears unable to foster reconciliation. 
Saygun evinced little hope that the situation in Iraq could 
be brought under control.  Partition, however, would be a 
disaster.  He criticized Iraqi Kurds for seeking a separate 
state in northern Iraq, prohibiting the Iraqi flag and 
promoting their own institutions.  He highlighted the status 
of Kirkuk as an issue of major concern for Turkey.  While 
120,000 Kurds were displaced from Kirkuk by Saddam, now 
400,000 were being resettled in the area with the intention 
of making it a Kurdish city.  Meanwhile, the Shi'a are 
expanding their influence from Tajikistan to the Gulf in a 
Shi'a "arc," Saygun warned. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Senator Lott thanked Turkey for its leadership in 
NATO and asked if Turkey could do more in Iraq.  Saygun said 
that Turkish facilities are available for the recalibration 
and refurbishment of U.S. equipment from Iran, with a 
potentially large cost savings to the U.S. government. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Saygun complained that PKK terrorists were operating 
in northern Iraq with impunity, despite Turkey-Iraq treaties 
from 1926 and 1946 whereby both sides pledge to address 
security problems on either side of the common border.  He 
expressed appreciation for U.S. help, said U.S. envoy General 
(retired) Ralston had done a "fantastic job," and hoped for 
success in a slow, painstaking process of combating PKK 
terror.  Saygun asserted that the PKK is responsible for 80 
percent of drugs going into Paris neighborhoods and controls 
the distribution of 40 percent of Europe's heroin.  The PKK 
is also deeply involved in the smuggling of weapons and 
people. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Turkey has enjoyed a peaceful border with Iran for 
centuries and Turkish authorities are cooperating with 
Iranian counterparts on border security against a common PKK 
threat, Saygun explained.  At the same time, Turkey does not 
want Iran to have a nuclear weapon and will participate in 
the international community's efforts to prevent this.  While 
Turkey is skeptical that economic sanctions will work, the 
GOT will do whatever it can without harming its relations in 
the region, Saygun said.  Asked what Turkey would recommend 
in the absence of diplomatic success, Saygun said trade and 
travel sanctions were of limited usefulness.  If Tehran wants 
to develop a bomb, it will, Saygun concluded, and Turkey will 
have to evaluate the political implications.

¶7. (SBU) Saygun asserted that the largest number of 
terrorists entering Iraq are being funneled through Syria. 
While Basher al-Assad is less violent than his father, he is 
still influenced by old Baathist stalwarts.  It will take 
time for Syria to integrate with the West. In Saygun's view, 
Basher needs a "helping hand" to keep out of Iran's embrace. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Turning to the Caucasus, Saygun said that Turkey 
invites Armenian officers to NATO PfP activities and reported 
that he had sat with his Armenian counterpart at a NATO 
meeting in Istanbul.  Turkey tolerates the presence of 40 
thousand or more illegal Armenian "guest workers."  Saygun 
told the Codels that Turks had also suffered much from 
Armenians.  If the Congress passes an Armenian genocide 
resolution, Turkey will be deeply hurt. 
 
¶9.  (SBU) NATO must be successful in Afghanistan, Saygun 
stated, noting that Turkey had donated 155 mm howitzers to 
the Afghan National Army.  Conditions on the ground remain 
difficult, however, and Afghanistan requires extensive 
reconstruction support. 
 
¶10. (SBU) Discussing energy security, Saygun said Russian 
President Putin's intentions are clear:  Russia wants to 
control every drop of oil going to the West. 
 
¶11. (SBU) Saygun said Turkish - U.S. relations had stood the 
test of time.  Since the end of the Cold War, however, there 
have been divergent interests.  In Saygun's view, the U.S. is 
far too big to share identical interests with smaller 
countries; this is natural and we are not expected to agree 
on everything.  Saygun denied that there is an organized 
anti-American "campaign" in Turkey. 
 
¶12. (SBU) Asked about Turkey-Israel relations, Saygun 
described a close security and defense industrial 
relationship. He said that, as the only democracies in the 
region, Turkey and Israel share a common fate and common 
challenges. 
 
¶13. (U) Codel Nelson and the Congressional Study Group on 
Turkey have cleared this message.
