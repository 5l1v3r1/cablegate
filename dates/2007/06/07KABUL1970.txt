SUBJECT: GUNMEN SHOOT SCHOOLGIRLS IN LOGAR 
 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Two schoolgirls were killed and five wounded on June 12 
when two assailants fired at students leaving a school in Logar 
Province south of Kabul.  Police report they have made three 
arrests, including one of the shooters.  Afghan authorities believe 
that the gunmen were Taliban members; however, a Taliban spokesman 
has denied responsibility.  Provincial officials have noted a 
decline in girls' attendance at school since the incident.  In 
response to a request from the Provincial Education Officer in 
Logar, UNICEF has agreed to build security walls around four other 
girls' schools in the province.  END SUMMARY. 
 
THE ATTACK AND ANP RESPONSE 
--------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Two gunmen fired indiscriminately at students in front of 
Khali Saida girls' middle and secondary school in Logar Province on 
June 12 (graduation day), killing two girls and wounding five 
others.  The assailants apparently waited for school to recess for 
the day and shot the girls (aged 12-14) from a nearby wheat field as 
the girls started to leave the school grounds.  The gunmen escaped 
on foot, but local Afghan National Police (ANP) officials say they 
have arrested three men in connection with the shooting.  ANP 
believe at least one of those arrested was an actual gunman and 
claim that the arrested gunman is an anti-government insurgent.  Two 
of the wounded girls were medevaced to Kabul and are listed in 
stable condition. 
 
TALIBAN RESPONSIBLE? 
-------------------- 
 
¶3.  (U) Afghan Education Minister Hanif Atmar condemned the attack 
and blamed the Taliban.  "Those who carried out this cowardly attack 
are the enemies of the country."  A Taliban spokesperson, however, 
denied responsibility for the assault, alleging that a tribal feud 
was the most likely motive.  During a June 16 ceremony, Minister 
Atmar vowed to build more girls' schools in Logar -- two of which 
will be named after the murdered girls -- as a testament to the 
GOA's commitment to women's education and its refusal to be 
intimidated by terrorist acts.  President Karzai also received the 
victims' families and elders from Logar at the Palace.  Solatia 
payments of USD $4000 and $1000, respectively, will be given to 
compensate families of the murdered and injured girls. 
 
UNICEF TO BUILD WALLS AROUND OTHER GIRLS' SCHOOLS 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶4.  (U) Having noted that attendance at girls' schools around the 
province has declined significantly since the shooting, the 
Provincial Education Officer asked the international community to 
build security walls around four other vulnerable girls' schools. 
UNICEF has agreed to build these walls, and USAID is identifying 
options to promote continuing girls' education in the community. 
 
 
THE LARGER PICTURE 
------------------ 
 
¶5. (SBU) While the Taliban have previously destroyed several girls' 
schools in the area and killed teachers, they have not directly 
attacked students in Logar province before.  The Ministry of 
Education reported that in 2006, nation-wide 198 schools were 
attacked and a total of 370 schools were closed due to threats or 
community fears, preventing almost 220,000 students from receiving 
an education.  These attacks killed at least 54 teachers, students, 
or other school employees.  The first half of 2007, however, has 
 
KABUL 00001970  002 OF 002 
 
 
generally witnessed a sharp decline in the number of attacks on 
schools, students, and teachers, presumably as Taliban and other 
insurgents realized that attacking Afghan children and teachers 
creates resistance within the local population.
