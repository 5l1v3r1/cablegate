¶1. (SBU) Justin Seruhere, Minister Plenipotentiary in the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs' (MFA) Department of Multilateral 
Cooperation, told Poloff on June 4 that he hoped Iran would 
change course and suspend its nuclear weapons program. 
Seruhere emphasized that Tanzania had an interest in 
preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons.  "This is 
not just an American problem," he noted.  Poloff highlighted 
the troubling report released on May 23 by the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and stressed the USG's aim to 
work with its partners and persuade Iran to set aside its 
nuclear ambitions. 
¶2.  (SBU) Explaining that the U.S. had recently submitted its 
60-day UNSCR 1747 report, Poloff inquired about the status of 
Tanzania's UNSCR 1737 and 1747 implementation reports. 
Seruhere said that the MFA was currently working on its 1737 
report and had recently received instructions from New York 
to start work on its 1747 report.  Seruhere promised to 
follow up on both reports, saying that the MFA was liaising 
with various authorities, such as the Bank of Tanzania and 
the Ministry of Defence to ensure that Tanzania fulfilled its 
obligations under these resolutions. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Poloff stressed to Seruhere that the comprehensive 
ban in resolution 1747 on "arms and related material," should 
be interpreted broadly to include weapons, military vehicles, 
equipment etc.  As Tanzania moves forward to implement the 
requirements under 1747, Poloff urged Seruhere to look at all 
items listed on the Wassenaar Arrangement Munitions List and 
to read the text of the U.S. 60-day report as it reflects a 
robust effort to implement UNSCR 1747.  Seruhere thanked 
Poloff for the information and promised to bring the matter 
to the attention of Ambassador Begum Taj, Head of the 
Department of Multilateral Cooperation at MFA, and to the 
attention of authorities responsible for banning the transfer 
and procurement of arms and related equipment.
