REF: STATE 75994 
 
¶1. (U) The Ambassador on June 12 signed reftel non-binding 
Memorandum of Understanding on Homeland Security Cooperation 
between the U.S. and Bahrain with Minister of Interior Shaikh 
Rashid bin Abdulla Al-Khalifa.  In attendance on the U.S. 
side were two Riyadh-based DHS representatives, Attache Donna 
Chabot and Assistant Attache Scott Marvin.  Shaikh Rashid 
welcomed the agreement, saying he hoped it would lead to 
greater cooperation in the areas of responsibility of the MOI 
and DHS, including cooperation between the two countries' 
Coast Guards.  Chabot expressed regret that Secretary 
Chertoff could not be in Bahrain to sign the MOU himself, as 
originally anticipated, adding that he had only postponed his 
planned trip to Bahrain and hoped to reschedule in the coming 
months. 
 
¶2. (U) Press coverage of the signing ceremony was excellent, 
including front-page coverage in several of the Arabic 
language newspapers.
