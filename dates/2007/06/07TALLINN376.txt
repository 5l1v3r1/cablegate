Â¶1. (SBU) On May 31, we delivered reftel points to Marin 
Mottus, MFA Director for the Middle East, Africa, and 
Latin America, and Keiu Saral, MFA Africa Desk Officer. 
On June 6, Saral informed us that since Estonia has no 
diplomatic relations with Sudan, it will support the 
EU's common position that will be agreed upon at the 
June 19 GAERC meeting.  Although Estonia has not taken 
an active role on this issue in EU fora, Keiu said that 
GOE is still open to every option, including sanctions, 
to pressure Sudan on Darfur.
