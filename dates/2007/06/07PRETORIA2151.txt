SUBJECT: SOUTH AFRICA ISSUES ESSENTIAL FACTS LETTER ON 
SUNSET REVIEW OF ANTIDUMPING DUTIES ON L-LYSINE HCI 
 
REF: PRETORIA 00249 
 
¶1.  South Africa's International Trade Administration 
Commission (ITAC) provided post with a copy of its "essential 
facts" letter regarding the sunset review of the anti-dumping 
duties of Lysine (reftel).  ITAC initiated the sunset review 
through notice on January 12, 2007, and following receipt and 
review of invited comments has issued its "essential fact" 
letter, which sets out the facts being considered by ITAC in 
making its final decision.  ITAC emphasized that it has not 
yet made its final determination and is accepting comments on 
the "essential facts" that must be submitted not later than 
15:00 on 22 June 2007. 
 
¶2.  ITAC's proposed final determination per the essential 
facts letter reads as follows:  The Commission is considering 
making a final determination that the expiry of the 
anti-dumping duty is likely to lead to the continuation or 
recurrence of dumping of lysine originating in or imported 
from the USA and that the expiry of the anti-dumping duty is 
likely to lead to the continuation of material injury.  The 
Commission is considering making a recommendation to the 
Minister of Trade and Industry that the anti-dumping duties 
on lysine originating in or imported from the USA be amended 
to 32% for all parties. 
 
¶3.  A full copy of ITAC's "essential facts" letter can be 
forwarded via email if requested.  Please contact economic 
officer Leslie Freriksen at freriksenld@state.gov to obtain a 
copy.
