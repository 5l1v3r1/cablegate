STATEMENTS REGARDING IRANIAN HARASSMENT/DETENTION OF AMCITS 
 
REF: STATE 80300 
 
(SBU) Poloff June 12 delivered reftel points to MFA Near East 
Affairs Attache Dionysis Dionysiou.  Dionysiou responded June 
13 that Cyprus likely would not take any unilateral action 
over the recent harassment/detention of private Americans by 
the Iranian regime.  For various reasons, Cyprus had little 
hope of influencing Teheran, he explained.  Despite each 
maintaining an embassy in the other's territory, for example, 
Iranian-Cypriot relations were not close.  To prove the 
point, he noted that the Iranian Ambassador to Cyprus had 
visited the MFA only once, for his courtesy call on Foreign 
Minister Lillikas.  In Tehran, the Cypriot Embassy was being 
run by a TDYer in the wake of a recent scandal involving its 
former ambassador; the official was too busy with internal 
management issues to do any bilateral work.  Further, Cyprus 
was a small island state with few carrots and no sticks to 
employ with the GoI.  The picture was somewhat brighter on 
the multilateral front, however.  Dionysiou assured Poloff 
that Cyprus supported the recent EU Presidency Statement 
against Iran's recent actions.  It also was open to a French 
proposal to include in the Council Conclusions for next 
week's GAERC meeting a statement urging the protection of 
academics and dual nationals visiting Iran.
