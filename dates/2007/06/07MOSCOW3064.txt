¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a Pre-license check to determine 
the legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, 
Vyacheslav Filinov, Moscow, Russia. The company is 
listed on BIS license application D373587 as the 
ultimate consignee of (4) four Leapers SCP394AOMDL 
fifth generation air rifle scopes. These items are 
controlled for foreign policy reasons under ECCN 
OA987. The licensee is ET Antiques, LLC, 14-20 George 
st., Fair Lawn, NJ 07410. 
 
¶3. On May 25, 2007, FSN Natalya Shipitsina contacted 
Vyacheslav Filinov by telephone.  Mr. Filinov stated 
that he was no longer interested in buying the scopes, 
and therefore did not see any reason to meet with the 
ECO. 
 
¶4. Recommendations: Post cannot determine the 
reliability of Vyacheslav Filinov as a recipient of 
sensitive U.S. goods or technology.
