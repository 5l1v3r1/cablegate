"In The Absence Of Peace, A War Between Palestinians" 
 
Business-oriented Valor Economico (6/19): "The lack of negotiated 
solutions for the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians and 
for the stabilization of Iraq has gradually imploded all governments 
of the region and made the political situation in the Middle East 
even more volatile and troublesome than before.... If peace 
opportunities have been lost with an irritating regularity, these 
crises favor opportunistic attempts to obtain advantages that lead 
to nowhere.... The US believes that the separation of regional 
Palestinian leaders will make the task of supporting one of the 
parties easier, and has promised to resume aid to President Mahmoud 
Abbas, thereby isolating the radicals.... It's the Bush 
administration's notorious ability to exchange reality for 
appearances, something that is even more disastrous in places such 
as the Middle East. It is absolutely unrealistic to believe in any 
peaceful way out, even temporary, while the Palestinians are 
divided."
