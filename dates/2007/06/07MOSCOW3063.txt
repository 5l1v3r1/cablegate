¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a Pre-license check to determine 
the legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, JSC 
Pribor.ru, Moscow, Russia. The company is listed on 
BIS license application D374431 as the ultimate 
consignee of two infrared imagers, Cantronic systems 
IR980. These items are controlled for national 
security and nuclear non-proliferation reasons under 
ECCN 6A003. The licensee is Cantronic International, 
2724 Summer St. NE, Minneapolis, MN 55413. 
 
¶3. On June 19, 2007, Export Control Attache Donald 
Pearce and FSN Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested pre-license check at the offices of JSC 
Pribor.ru (Pribor), Schelkovskoe Shosse 23a, Moscow, 
Russia. The export control team met with Aleksey 
Lisin, Executive Director. 
 
¶4. Pribor was founded one year ago as a procurement 
agent and distributor of testing and diagnostic tools 
for heavy industry.  The company specializes in the 
metallurgical and shipbuilding industries, and has 
approximately 3000 clients nationwide.  Their client 
list consists of both commercial and government end 
users, including the Federal Atomic Energy Agency 
(Russian acronym ROSATOM) and the Federal Housing 
Administration (Russian abbreviation ZhKA).  Pribor 
has 12 distributors located throughout Russia.  Pribor 
employs approximately 400 at its headquarters, located 
in a multiple-tenant commercial facility in northern 
Moscow. 
 
¶5. Pribor plans on using the imagers in reftel as 
demonstration units for potential clients.  Two 
managers, Mr. Lisin and a sales manager to be 
determined, will be responsible for the demonstrations 
to potential clients.  The company plans on marketing 
the devices for a variety of non-destructive testing 
and preventative maintenance purposes.   When not in 
use, the imagers will be stored in a safe in Mr. 
Lisin's office.  Cantronic advised Mr. Lisin of the 
license conditions normally applied to demonstrator 
units. 
 
¶6. Security at the facility is maintained 24 hours a 
day, seven days a week.  Access to the offices is 
granted only by presentation of a valid employee ID or 
passport, which is scanned and saved on a computer. 
An electronic security system is in place at the 
office as well.  Any equipment brought into or out of 
the complex is checked by security, and logs of all 
equipment are kept. 
 
¶7. Recommendations: Post recommends JSC Pribor.ru, 
Moscow, Russia, as a reliable recipient of sensitive 
U.S. origin commodities. It is requested that post be 
notified of final disposition of the application, and 
of any shipments for this organization in order to 
conduct appropriate FCS follow-up and statistical 
reporting.
