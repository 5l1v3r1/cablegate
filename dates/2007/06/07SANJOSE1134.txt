SUBJECT: COSTA RICA - RESPONSE TO ARMS TREATY DEMARCHE 
 
REF: STATE 63299 
 
¶1.  (U) On May 31, Pol/C and Poloff discussed USG position (Reftel) 
on the proposed UN Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) with MFA Deputy Director 
for Exterior Policy Alejandro Solis.  We left a non-paper; noted 
that the USG was presenting a demarche on the issue to a number of 
host governments, including ATT co-sponsors; and asked that the GOCR 
consider the USG position.  Solis said he would get back to us.  On 
June 6, the MFA responded via Diplomatic Note (DGPE-DT-052-07) 
covering a non-paper (see informal translation below). 
 
¶2. (SBU) COMMENT:  We were struck by how quickly the MFA responded 
(a new record for here in San Jose), and the favorable tone of the 
response, which stresses the general areas of agreement between the 
proposed ATT and current USG practice and policy.   However, given 
the importance the Arias administration places on the ATT 
initiative, we anticipate that the GOCR will be more inclined to 
seek USG support for the ATT than to accept USG proposals (should 
there be any) to modify the text.  END COMMENT.

COMMENTS REGARDING A NON-PAPER ON THE PROPOSAL FOR AN ARMS TRADE 
TREATY (ATT) 
 
Costa Rica, together with other Nations, has proposed the 
negotiation of a legally-binding Arms Trade Treaty.  This is a 
further step in the process initiated by a proposal from Nobel Peace 
Prize Laureate Oscar Arias-Sanchez -proposal adopted by the Group of 
Nobel Laureates- for an international code of conduct on 
international arms transfers.  As meetings developed and new States 
joined the proposal, it was concluded that, though the Treaty is a 
slower negotiation mechanism, the Treaty will exert pressure, as no 
other voluntary compliance mechanism would, on those countries 
trading arms to governments and to irregular groups violating human 
rights. 
 
Within this context, we highly value the commitment of the United 
States on the strict monitoring of exports, as well as the 
cooperation offered to third countries to establish their own 
monitoring mechanisms and legislation.  Clearly, Costa Rica 
encourages all countries to establish national laws to prevent or 
reduce irresponsible arms trade. 
 
Nonetheless, there is no contradiction between national efforts and 
negotiations for an international treaty, but both could complement 
each other.  Costa Rica is aware that among the 24 countries that 
abstained [from voting], some are main export countries, and their 
incorporation into negotiations would probably be a slow and 
complicated process.  We faced the same experience with other 
treaties designed to limit arms production and export, such as those 
to ban anti-personal landmines. 
 
Similarly, there is agreement regarding [arms] control, as it was 
mentioned in the document, in such areas as: 
 
-- Exporter and arms dealer registration; 
-- [Arms export] control list, for those requiring an export 
license; and, 
-- Monitoring [measures] and compulsory national legislation. 
 
Costa Rica urges all countries to participate in the United Nations 
Group of Experts on an Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) in 2008.  The mandate 
on this subject is clear, and according to its terms, Costa Rica 
will make all efforts to ensure that the results are simultaneously 
inclusive and effective, for the purpose of eradicating or reducing 
uncontrolled arms trade.  Arms trade entails paying an unacceptable 
high price for life, health and production in a lot of countries, 
some considered among the less developed countries of the world.
