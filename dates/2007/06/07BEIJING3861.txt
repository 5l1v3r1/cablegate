Firm Opposition to President Bush-Kadeer Meeting 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶2. At the June 7 regular MFA press briefing, spokesperson 
Jiang Yu responded to a question about President Bush's 
decision to meet with Uighur-activist Rebiya Kadeer by 
expressing China's "strong dissatisfaction and firm 
opposition" to what she called a "blatant interference in 
China's internal affairs."  Jiang emphasized China's views 
that Kadeer is a "convicted criminal." 
 
¶3. Asked for comment on President Bush's reported remarks 
that political reform in China was not keeping up with 
economic opening, the spokesperson stated that China has 
achieved economic development, social stability and 
development in the country's democracy and legal system in 
the nearly thirty years since opening and the Chinese people 
enjoy many rights and freedoms.  She reasserted that the 
Chinese people and government will unswervingly follow the 
road of socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
 
Formal Diplomatic Ties with Costa Rica 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. Responding to four questions regarding the June 7 
announcement that the PRC has established diplomatic 
relations with Costa Rica, Jiang said that ties were based on 
respect and mutual benefit and represented a new period in 
bilateral relations.  Although previously China did not have 
diplomatic relations with any Central American countries, it 
is ready to establish those ties.  The resolution of the 
Taiwan question is the main obstacle, Jiang stated, and China 
hopes that those countries will make the right choice.  China 
is preparing to establish an Embassy in Costa Rica and 
welcomes visits by the Costa Rican president and other 
high-level officials, Jiang said.  Asked if China was 
planning any specific investments or economic assistance in 
Costa Rica, Jiang reiterated that ties were based on respect 
and mutual benefit and that they would benefit both countries 
in political, cultural, economic as well as other fields. 
Se stressed that China's diplomatic relations wit 169 
countries are not a matter of money bt of recognition of the 
one-China policy. 
 
G-8 Discussion on DPRK, President Hu's G-8 Schedule 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶5. Asked if China would support a possible G-8 statement on 
the DPRK nuclear issue, Jiang said she had not heard that the 
matter would be discussed at the G-8 meeting.  If the issue 
is raised, she expressed hope that discussion can play a 
positive role in "the resolution of relevant questions." 
Responding to a reporter's question, Jiang confirmed that 
President Hu would meet today with leaders from Nigeria, 
Senegal, Mexico and India before joining a collective meeting 
of developing nations this evening.  She said Hu also plans 
to meet with leaders from Russia, the United States, France, 
Japan, Germany, Canada and Italy tomorrow. 
 
Bishop from Hebei Detained 
-------------------------- 
 
¶6. Asked to comment on a report made by the Cardinal Kung 
Foundation that Catholic bishop Jia Zhiguo has been detained 
in Hebei Province, Jiang stated that she was unaware of the 
case but that Chinese citizens enjoy religious freedom in 
accordance with the law and should not engage in illegal 
activities under the guise of religion. 
 
Foreign Assistance 
------------------

¶7. Asked how much foreign aid China granted each year and for 
what purposes, the spokesperson replied that the matter was 
not under the MFA's realm of responsibility.  Jiang stated 
that assistance to developing countries within the framework 
of north-south cooperation seeks to build infrastructure 
projects and improve people's welfare. 
 
Still No Judgment on Lee's Visit to Yasukuni 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶8. Pushed again for comment on the recent visit of Lee 
Teng-hui to the Yasukuni Shrine, Jiang only expressed China's 
strong dissatisfaction with the Japanese for receiving Lee's 
visit to Japan.

------------------------------

June 17-19 at the invitation of FM Yang.
