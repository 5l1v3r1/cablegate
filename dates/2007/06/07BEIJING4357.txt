sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, Qin 
added. 
 
Japan Has Historic Responsbility to Resolve Issues

¶4. China's consistent position on comfort women and forced 
labor during World War II is that Japan should take a 
responsible attitude toward history to appropriately, 
earnestly and truthfully deal with these issues, said Qin in 
response to questions on the recent House Foreign Affairs 
Committee resolution urging a formal apology to comfort women 
and a ruling by Japan's Sapporo High Court rejecting redress 
demands.

pay a visit July 7-8 to meet with leaders and discuss

was conducive to increasing mutual understanding and trust 
and further developing the constructive bilateral

Judging from the United States' reaction, both countries have 
a common view on the success of the Dialogue, in added, which 
included discussions on bilateral and international issues of 
common interest. 
 
MFA Refutes Remarks that Hong Kong is "Caged Bird" 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶7. Under the successful policy of Hong Kong self rule, the 
region has witnessed economic prosperity and improved living 
standards and enjoys internationally recognized democracy and 
freedom, Qin stated in response to a remark by Chen Shui-bian 
that over the last ten years Hong Kong has been like a bird 
in a cage with no democracy and limited freedom.

------------------------------------------- 
 
BEIJING 00004357  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
 
¶8. The spokesman remarked that two panda bears given to Spain 
would serve as "envoys of the Chinese people" in promoting 
friendly Sino-Spanish relations.  China's stance based on 
"the two principles" toward the Vatican is consistent and 
clear, said Qin when asked for comment on the Pope's 
intention to send an open letter to Chinese Catholics.  Qin 
confirmed that the MFA had completed an audit by the 
Auditor-General providing no further details, when asked by a 
reporter if the MFA had misused or embezzled funds.
