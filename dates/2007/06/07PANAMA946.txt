RHMFIUU/US CUSTOMS AND BORDER PRO WASHINGTON DC¶6. (U) Panama continues to cooperate fully and enable the USG (in 
particular DEA and DHS/USCG) to transport to the U.S. third country 
nationals apprehended in international waters on suspicion of drug 
trafficking. 
 
¶7. (U) The USG-funded Guabala checkpoint on the Pan-American Highway 
near the border with Costa Rica continues to seize narcotics as well 
as stop illegals attempting to transit Panama enroute to the U.S. 
DHS/CBP officers will conduct additional training for checkpoint 
officers later this month.  In addition, officials from several 
Panamanian law enforcement entities participated in the annual joint 
training exercise called Operation Firewall with Special Agents from 
DHS/ICE and Officers from DHS/CBP at Tocumen International Airport 
for 45 days in March and August of 2006.  The operation utilized 
specific targeting techniques to identify, seize, and investigate 
bulk cash smuggling (BCS) methods. 
 
¶8. (U) DHS/ICE coordinated three-week basic investigators courses 
for Panamanian investigator and prosecutors at the Federal Law 
Enforcement Academy (FLETC).  Over 40 mid-level investigators and 
prosecutors attended two sessions of the course, designed to develop 
the requisite skills of personnel assigned to key border and airport 
security positions. 
 
¶9. (U) Panama's National Police (PNP) has committed more than 50 of 
its most senior officers to regular and continuing training under 
the NAS-led police modernization program, aimed at making the PNP a 
more efficient, transparent, and community-oriented force.  The 
program has received excellent press attention and senior GOP 
officials regularly point to it as evidence of U.S. commitment to 
improving local public security.
