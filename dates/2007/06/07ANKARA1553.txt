In Today's Papers 
 
Turks React to Hudson Institute's 'Turkey Scenarios' 
All papers over the weekend and today report on a "controversial" 
meeting held by the Hudson Institute in Washington on June 13 which 
discussed possible "crisis scenarios" in Turkey.  Over the weekend, 
Turkish officials criticized the meeting because of its crisis 
scenarios such as the assassination of the head of the 
Constitutional Court and a PKK suicide attack which would kill 50 
people in downtown Istanbul.  The participants, including a Turkish 
military delegation visiting Washington, were asked whether the 
ruling AKP would lose votes or whether a Turkish military 
intervention in northern Iraq would cause the Erdogan government to 
lose its popularity in such probabilities.  Papers report Kubat 
Talabani, Iraqi President Jalal Talabani's son and the 
representative of the Kurdistan Regional Administration in 
Washington, was also present at the meeting.  On Monday, Foreign 
Minister Abdullah Gul told Hurriyet that the Turkish generals 
attending the meeting should have walked out when the "disaster 
scenario" was raised.  Prime Minister Erdogan commented on CNN Turk 
about the alleged scenarios, "I find it hard to understand whose 
interests are served by such scenarios.  We are prepared to ensure 
that such scenarios do not materialize.  Nevertheless, we have 
witnessed such scenarios recently."  Weekend papers also reported 
Turkish Foreign Ministry (MFA) officials said such scenarios cannot 
be taken seriously. 
 
Monday's papers report Ken Weinstein, the CEO of Hudson Institute, 
expressed regret that the details of an off-the-record meeting were 
given to the press, adding those who leaked it only aim to increase 
tension. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Hudson Institute 'Turkey Meeting' 
Semih Idiz observed in the mainstream daily Milliyet (6/18):  "We 
should look for the reasons of the scenarios produced by the Hudson 
Institute, including the assassination of former Constitutional 
Court President Tugcu, a major PKK attack in Istanbul, or the 
Turkish military entering Northern Iraq, not in Washington but in 
Turkey.  Because when Turkey is observed from abroad, all that can 
be seen is state offices in conflict, and clashes in the domestic 
politics.  These happenings prevent the achievement of consensus, 
which is vital for the country's strategic interests.  Evaluating 
the meeting at the Hudson Institute, it is easy to say 'they went 
beyond their limits', however, it is not possible to obstruct such 
meetings because through this kind of brainstorming, Americans are 
trying to collect information on developments that could affect 
their strategic interests.  Besides, it is a well known fact that 
other countries, including Turkey (in its military think thank 
organization SAREM), have such institutes to discuss such scenarios. 
 Actually, we should consider this scenario a useful way to reflect 
on the current political situation in Turkey.  If there are such 
evaluations about Turkey, we should not blame Washington, but look 
to Ankara which gives such complicated signals on political 
developments." 
 
Turkey Invites Iraqi PM to Discuss the PKK 
Milliyet, Sabah, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Zaman and others report 
Turkey's Ambassador to Iraq, Derya Kanbay, conveyed a letter of 
invitation from Prime Minister Erdogan to Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri 
al-Maliki to visit Turkey and discuss PKK terrorism.  The message 
also expressed support for Maliki's proposal to establish an 
economic and commercial committee between the two countries.  Maliki 
reportedly emphasized willingness to prevent the PKK from operating 
in Iraq. 
 
Meanwhile, Iraq's Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari told 
CNN-International in New York that Turkey's concerns over the PKK 
were legitimate.  "Erdogan's statement that terrorism should first 
be dealt with inside Turkey encouraged us," Zebari is quoted as 
saying.

General Pittard Warns the Kurds 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Yeni Safak and 
others report General Dana J. H. Pittard, working with the Iraqi 
forces on the Iraq-Turkey border, told The Washington Post that the 
Kurdish regional government "must help out in muzzling the PKK or 
suffer the consequences."  The paper also quotes an unidentified 
Iraqi security official as saying the US needs to "pinch Barzani" to 
take a harder line against the PKK.  The Iraqi border force does not 
have the power to stop Turkish troops from coming into Iraq or to 
keep the PKK terrorists from pushing out to Turkey, the official 
added. 
 
AKP Delegation Fails to Secure US Support 
Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet on Saturday claimed a delegation of 
AKP MPs, Egemen Bagis, Reha Denemec and Mevlut Cavusoglu, in 
Washington last week for talks, failed to secure American support 
for the AKP before the July 22 elections.  In Washington, Secretary 
Rice and State Department officials insist on continuing support for 
the AKP, while Pentagon bureaucrats and Jewish lobby groups believe 
the AKP should not be backed because of its close ties with Hamas 
and Hizbullah, according to Cumhuriyet. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Palestine 
Ferai Tinc commented in mainstream daily Hurriyet (6/18):  "The ones 
who believed that peace could be established in the Middle East not 
by resolving the problems between Israel and Palestine, but by 
toppling Saddam, are mistaken once again.  The US and Israel are 
preparing to help Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas who is seeking 
shelter in the West Bank.  Would Hamas be elected today if the US 
had not ignored Abbas' calls for help to solve domestic issues after 
he was elected as President in 2005?  Moreover,  Abbas warned the US 
and Israel in 2006- when they pressured Palestine for elections - 
that Fatah would not be able to get the majority in the new 
Parliament, but no one listened to him.  Now, Washington is planning 
to support an Abbas government in the West Bank by extending 
financial aid.  Israel is still evaluating whether it could support 
Fatah against Hamas.  Hamas has no plans to improve relations with 
Israel because their ideology is to destroy Israel some day and 
allow Palestinians to own Palestine.  But could it be possible to 
establish a government in the West Bank without taking into 
consideration Hamas and 1.5 million Palestinians in Gaza?  The West 
failed to help the moderate Palestinian leader Abbas in time."
