SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) A recent China-Africa Trade and Investment Symposium in 
Zhenzhou, held in conjunction with the Central Chin Expo, 
attracted a large number of local Chinse businesseople but failed 
to provide many pportunities for dialogue with African 
counterparts.  Although it might have been the Expo's nod to the 
Central government's push for increased trade and investment in 
African countries, the symposium had limited scope and the Expo had 
a low level of participation from African government or business 
representatives.  The Expo instead demonstrated that Central China 
is focusing its efforts on drumming up investment and trade 
domestically and with Hong Kong. END SUMMARY. 
 
TRAVEL TO ZHENGZHOU 
------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Embassy officers traveled to Zhengzhou, capital of China's 
most populous province (Henan), for the second annual Central China 
Expo April 25-27 (reftel A).  Zhengzhou, a Virtual Presence Post 
city (reftel B), serves as one of the economic centers of the 
Central China region cut-out by the Central Government.  In addition 
to meetings on the sidelines of the Expo with businesspeople and 
African diplomats, Emboff also attended the China-Africa symposium. 
 
 
A NOD TO CHINA-AFRICA TRADE 
--------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) At the China-Africa Trade and Investment Symposium in 
Zhengzhou, Chinese officials said, the Central Government is 
actively engaging African countries in closer relations and working 
to forge deeper economic ties with the region.  In November 2006, 
Beijing hosted the Summit on the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, 
a large scale event that included participation at the highest 
levels of Chinese Government and sponsorship of delegates from 
nearly 50 African nations.  Central China Expo organizers' inclusion 
of a China-Africa seminar and their support of African diplomats' 
travel to the Expo were a nod to the Central Government's push for 
increased trade and investment with the continent. 
 
CENTRAL CHINA BUSINESSES SEARCH FOR NEW MARKETS... 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶4. (SBU) The symposium was well attended by Chinese businesspeople 
but had limited scope and was not attended by the African diplomats 
present at the expo.  All presenters were employees or clients of a 
consulting firm that provides market entry assistance to Chinese 
companies doing business in South Africa and vice versa.  The 
majority of attendees that Emboff spoke to during the symposium were 
small- to mid-sized business owners with no previous experience in 
exporting.  They were enthusiastic to look for any profit generating 
opportunities despite their lack of experience or exposure to 
foreign markets.  In a conversation with Emboff, a local businessman 
stated that he had no connection with Africa as of yet, but Africa 
was known to have opportunities for Chinese companies so he had come 
to investigate.  This seemed to be the prevailing attitude among 
attendees. 
 
¶5. (SBU) In addition to business people seeking new markets for 
their products, one business representative inquired about 
opportunities to export labor to Africa.  The speaker, a 
representative of a company called Beijing Axis, responded that this 
was a sensitive issue in China-Africa trade due to what he said was 
South Africa's greater than 50 percent unemployment rate and strong 
labor exploitation concerns surrounding Chinese workers in Africa. 
 
 
¶6. (SBU) Not all of the attendees were new to the Africa market.  A 
number of businesspeople with a decade or more of experience 
exporting products and services to Africa came to the event.  An 
executive from a Henan-based meat packing corporation told Emboff 
that he had exported over USD 500,000 in pork products alone to 
Africa in 2006.  He stated that most of his company's exports were 
sent to South Africa and Angola. 
 
...BUT INTEREST IN AFRICA STILL BASED IN BEIJING 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Many Beijing-based African diplomats attended the Central 
China Expo (although not the China-Africa Symposium itself) but most 
said their countries do not have direct trade and investment links 
with Henan Province or the Central Region.  A Second Secretary from 
 
BEIJING 00003870  002 OF 002 
 
 
Sierra Leone's Embassy said he had been sent to the trade fair to 
represent his government because his Ambassador was too busy 
accompanying a Bejiing-based trade delegation to Freetown for a 
minerals trade mission.  In other words, the diplomat indicated, 
enthusiasm for trade with Africa was much more intense in Beijing 
than in Zhengzhou. 
 
CENTRAL CHINA'S FOCUS REMAINS ELSEWHERE 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) During a meeting with Econoffs, Wei Zhiyong, Director of 
the Foreign Economy Department of the Henan Provincial Development 
and Reform Commission, indicated that there was in fact little 
representation from Africa at the Central China Expo.  Wei 
underscored the importance provincial officials place on Hong Kong 
and Macau's representation at the expo and indicated that attracting 
increased investment and trade from Hong Kong and Macau was their 
priority.  The commercial exhibition portion of the expo evidenced 
this, as there was no marked African presence, and the vast majority 
of exhibitors hailed from the mainland or Hong Kong. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) Despite the appearance that the symposium could generate 
opportunities for Central China businesses to engage Africa, the 
symposium, coupled with limited expo participation from African 
diplomats and no apparent African commercial presence, showed that 
the organizers did not execute in this regard.  Although 
China-Africa contracts, investment and aid are major headlines in 
Beijing, the expo indicated that much of China's trade with Africa 
has not reached the country's central provinces.  END COMMENT.
