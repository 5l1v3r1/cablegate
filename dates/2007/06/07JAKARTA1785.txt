¶1. On June 28, we conveyed U.S. support for the proposed 
UN-AU hybrid peacekeeping operation in Darfur to Deputy 
Director for International Security Fikri Cassidy at the 
Indonesian Department of Foreign Affairs and asked whether 
Indonesia planned to contribute to the mission.  Cassidy, who 
has recently returned to Jakarta from Indonesia's UN Mission 
in New York, said no final decision had been made yet. 
However, it was his understanding that Indonesia planned to 
contribute one or two Formed Police Units.  A UNDPKO 
delegation was scheduled to visit Jakarta in the next week or 
two to facilitate that step.  He noted Indonesia currently 
had about 15 Military Observers at UNMIS in Sudan. 
 
¶2. Cassidy said he expected to have further details soon and 
would inform us once a decision had been made.
