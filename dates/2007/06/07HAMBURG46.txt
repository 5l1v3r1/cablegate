and owner of the company, and general manager Kerstin Blankmann. 
 Both Henke and Blankmann directly answered all of Pol/Econ Off 
and ICE Off's questions regarding their trade with the U.S., 
products, customers, licensing, bookkeeping, and security 
procedures.  Officers inspected the facilities and received 
copies of shipping receipts and sales for the products included 
in the above listed licenses.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Prior to visiting Heinz Henke Inc., post inquired with 
local law enforcement officials regarding the company's records 
and reputation.  The officials had recorded no derogatory 
information to date on the company. 
 
¶3. (SBU) On May 23 ConGen Hamburg Pol/Econ Off and DHS ICE Off 
paid an unannounced visit to Heinz Henke Inc.  Officers were 
welcomed by the company founder/owner Heinz Henke and his 
general manager Kerstin Blankmann.  Heinz Henke Inc. is a 
shooting/hunting supplies company.  The majority of Henke's 
customers are smaller hunting supply dealers/sports shops.  A 
small amount of their sales come from direct internet orders 
from individuals.  Henke publishes an annual catalogue, which he 
supplies to his customers.  The company's web page is: 
www.Henke-online.de.  Henke explained that he founded the 
company in 1978 and started trading with the U.S. in 1981, in 
particular with the U.S. company Leupold.  Henke said he was 
aware of U.S. export regulations and very familiar with U.S. 
practice in the field.  He maintains a regular trade 
relationship with numerous U.S. hunting supply companies.  Both 
Henke and Blankmann stressed that they undergo all German 
licensing requirements on a regular basis.  They also require 
that all of their customers provide the appropriate licenses for 
the products they purchase as well as an EG IDENT number 
(European tax number).  Blankmann showed ConGen Officers 
originals of the types of licenses their customers must provide. 
 Henke confirmed that the majority of their customers are 
German, with a few customers in France, Italy, the Netherlands 
and Portugal.  He verified that all of the company's customers 
were located within the EU.  In a follow-up call on May 30, 
Pol/Econ Specialist reiterated that according to U.S. 
regulations there are licensing requirements for both exports as 
well as re-exports.  Furthermore, Pol/Econ Specialist pointed 
out that U.S. regulations on re-exports apply to exports to all 
countries, whether they are EU member states or not.  Blankmann 
confirmed in writing on June 14 that Henke Inc. is aware of 
these licensing requirements.  She also re-confirmed that Heinz 
Henke Inc. was not exporting parts or complete weapons to non-EU 
member states.  Blankmann wrote that Heinz Henke Inc. did not 
intend to re-export any of the articles contained in the three 
licenses and had not applied for re-export licenses for those 
products. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Henke Inc. is currently located at Bahnhofstrasse 57 in 
D-49757 Werlte, a former Telekom building.  Henke explained that 
the company was originally housed in his residence, but due to 
business expansion and security concerns the business moved to 
its current location in 1997.  Henke bought the building in 
¶2006.  The entire complex is surrounded by a 7-foot fence topped 
with barbed-wire and has a burglar alarm system throughout the 
building.  The business currently has 18 employees, although 
about half are part-time.  It maintains a fulltime accountant 
and a computerized system of stock and sales.  Henke explained 
that all employees who handle weapons undergo a security 
background check.  Stock is stored on the ground floor of the 
building, with offices on the second floor.  Weapons and 
ammunition are kept in a special gated room with steel 
reinforcements, which Blankmann pointed out to ConGen Officers. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Henke and Blankmann were able to quickly identify the 
products received under the three licenses and produced original 
invoices, customs documentation, shipping bills, and packaging 
slips for the orders.  Henke displayed an in-depth knowledge of 
his stock and whether it had been sold or was still in the 
warehouse. 
 
¶6. (SBU) License 05-1010712: Henke confirmed receipt of the 
 
HAMBURG 00000046  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
pistol and rifle frames contender, barrels and cases.  He stated 
that this was the first time he had ordered these items, as this 
particular design was new on the market and that he had a 
personal interest in this type of weapon.  Henke told Officers 
that these particular items were at his home for testing and he 
offered to retrieve them for Officers to view personally.  He 
verified that none of the items under this license had been sold. 
 
¶7. (SBU) License 05-050028367: Henke also confirmed receipt of 
these rifles from Savage Arms.  He stated that Savage Arms had 
sent the items to Henke for display at the International Weapons 
Exposition (IWA) this past March in Nuremburg.  According to 
Henke, Savage Arms would like Henke to become its German 
distributor.  Henke verified that none of these items had been 
sold and were all in storage in their warehouse. 
 
¶8. (SBU) License 05-050024284: Henke confirmed receipt of the 
replacement triggers from Shilen Rifles and stated that his 
company regularly receives shipments from Shilen.  Henke stated 
that under German law customers are not required to show special 
licensing in order to purchase triggers.  He stated that some of 
the triggers from this shipment were still in the warehouse and 
procured one of them for ConGen Officers.  Blankmann provided 
ConGen Officers with documentation for the sale of some of the 
triggers to customers.  She also explained and documented that 
17 of the triggers were being used for custom-designed rifles 
that Henke Inc. produces and sells through its catalogue. 
 
¶9. (U) Henke and Blankmann were very cooperative with ConGen 
Officers and appeared pleased to have Officers visit their 
facilities.  Henke stated that the May 23 visit was the first 
time he had been contacted by USG representatives.  Henke not 
only trades regularly with U.S. companies, he said, but also 
travels to the U.S. at least once annually to attend trade shows 
and meet with trading partners.  He said that he had just 
returned from Florida, where he had visited this year's Shot 
Show in Orlando.
