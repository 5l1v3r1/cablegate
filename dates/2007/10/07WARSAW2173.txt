  (SBU) PolOff delivered reftel points on the candidacy of 
David Walker for the UN Independent Audit Advisory Committee 
(IAAC) to Grzegorz Kozuba of the MFA,s UN Department on 
October 31.  Kozuba noted that the Polish UN Mission had 
already shared the information on Walker's candidacy with the 
MFA and that the GOP looked favorably on his candidacy, but 
the final decision regarding GOP,s support would be made on 
the day of the IIAC election. Kozuba explained that, earlier 
in October, Poland agreed to support the Swiss candidate if 
Switzerland would agree to enter into a mutual support 
agreement for candidates to international organizations. 
However, the GOP has not yet heard from Switzerland on this 
particular proposal.  Kozuba indicated that, if there were no 
response from the Swiss by the morning of November 2, the GOP 
would instruct its UN Mission in New York to vote for Mr. 
Walker.  Post will follow up with Kozuba on Friday.
