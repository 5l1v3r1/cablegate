REF: OTTAWA 1076 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  On October 17, the Government of Canada 
announced a three-step strategy to strengthen the protection 
of intellectual property rights (IPR).  While short on 
details and timelines, the strategy addresses several USG's 
concerns, including conforming Canadian law with the WIPO 
Internet Treaties, increasing IPR enforcement and awareness, 
and the already enacted ban on illicit recording in movie 
theaters.  The GOC announcement -- which follows a strong IPR 
statement in the government's October 16 "Speech from the 
Throne" -- is the latest sign that Ottawa is moving to 
bolster IPR protection in Canada. End Summary. 
 
IPR Strategy 
--------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Canada's Governor General stated in the Harper 
government's "Speech from the Throne" to Parliament on 
October 16 that the GOC "will improve the protection of 
cultural and intellectual property rights in Canada, 
including copyright reform."  On October 17 -- in a written 
response to a June 20 Parliamentary Committee report 
("Counterfeiting and Piracy are Theft") -- the Ministers of 
Public Safety, Industry, International Trade, and Justice 
outlined how improved IPR protection will be pursued.  The 
strategy has three aspects, including criminalizing illicit 
camcording in movie theaters, which was completed in June 
(reftel).  Another aspect involves increasing IPR enforcement 
and raising awareness of the dangers of IPR crimes.  Step 
three is to bring Canada's copyright regime into conformity 
with the WIPO Internet Treaties.  The Ambassador and other 
Embassy officials over the last several months have urged 
senior Canadian officials, including Prime Minister Harper, 
to strengthen IPR legislation and enforcement. 
 
Enforcement and Awareness 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) The GOC has tasked the Minister of Public Safety to 
work with the Industry Minister -- in consultation with the 
Ministers of Canadian Heritage, International Trade, and 
Justice -- "to develop options to strengthen and modernize 
Canada,s enforcement regime."  The Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police (RCMP) is charged with increasing public awareness of 
IPR crime, and has already disseminated a poster series of 
posters about the dangers of IPR crime relating to job loss, 
injury, and organized crime.  The GOC gives no timeline for 
compiling enforcement recommendations, but the Ministers 
should be able to draw on the work of a lower level Canadian 
interagency task force that has been examining these issues 
since the end of 2004. 
 
WIPO 
------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) The third step in the GOC,s IPR strategy is 
"bringing Canada's copyright regime into conformity with the 
World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Internet 
Treaties."  (Comment:  Noted IPR commentator Michael Geist 
from the University of Ottawa makes a point to say that the 
government refers to "conformity with" and not "ratification 
of" the WIPO Internet Treaties.  End comment) The GOC has 
called on all parties in Parliament to support the 
government,s efforts in this area.  Embassy contacts in the 
Privy Council, Prime Minister's Office, Industry Canada, and 
the private sector report that the GOC plans to introduce 
major copyright legislation no later than November.  One 
well-connected industry executive told EMIN that seven 
longstanding internal disputes have now been resolved -- 
mostly in favor of greater IPR protection and Industry 
Minister Prentice last week reaffirmed to EMIN that IPR 
QMinister Prentice last week reaffirmed to EMIN that IPR 
reform remains "my top priority."  An RCMP official told 
Econoff that although some Industry Canada bureaucrats oppose 
strengthening certain areas of IPR protection, they are no 
longer able to hold up the legislative process.
