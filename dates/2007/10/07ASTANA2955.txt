SUBJECT: KAZAKHSTAN NONCOMMITTAL ON UNGA THIRD COMMITTEE 
RESOLUTIONS, UNLIKELY TO CHANGE POSITION FROM PREVIOUS YEARS 
 
REF: (A) State 136426, (B) State 145641 
 
¶1. Poloff delivered Ref B demarche to Amanbek Demesinov, director of 
the international organizations section of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, on October 30. Demesinov said that in general it was too 
early for the Government of Kazakhstan to make commitments or even 
reveal its inclinations at this point, though he intimated that 
Kazakhstan would not change its position from last year's voting on 
the country specific resolutions.  (Note: In 2006, Kazakhstan voted 
for the resolutions on Burma and North Korea, and opposed the 
resolutions on Belarus, Iran, and Uzbekistan.  End note.) 
 
¶2. Demesinov recalled Poloff's previous demarche on the issue of 
rape as an instrument of state policy (ref A), but he said there 
were some complications with the resolution that were making it 
difficult for Kazakhstan to support it.  He said that a group of 
African states was opposed to the resolution, and this was causing 
Kazakhstan to hesitate.  He was unwilling to offer more specific 
information.
