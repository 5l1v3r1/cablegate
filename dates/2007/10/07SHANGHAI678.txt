¶1.  (SBU) On October 3, U.S. Secretary of Education Margaret 
Spellings held a short bilateral exchange with President of the 
Republic of Iceland Olafur Grimsson on the margins of the 
Special Olympics Global Policy Summit on the Well-being of 
People with Intellectual Disabilities.  The meeting was at 
President Grimsson's request, in his capacity as an 
international board member of Special Olympics. Grimsson was 
accompanied by Special Olympics Chairman Timothy Shriver. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Speaking on behalf of the international board members 
of Special Olympics, Grimsson thanked Secretary Spellings and 
President Bush for their support for the organization.  He said 
that, as the Chinese have recently discovered through hosting 
the summer games, association with the Special Olympics is a 
very good investment in international goodwill.  Grimsson noted 
that although Special Olympics is an international organization, 
it is inseparable from America, with its headquarters in the 
United States and its close association with the Kennedy-Shriver 
family.  Grimsson said it is among the best manifestations of 
what the United States represents and while not a U.S. 
"propaganda machine," Special Olympics is perhaps the only such 
global organization with such close ties to the United States. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Given the unique global impact of the Special 
Olympics, Grimsson urged the Administration and Congress to 
provide stronger long-term support for the organization. 
Shriver echoed those sentiments.  Specifically, he asked that 
Special Olympics received the full funding allowed under the 
Sports Empowerment Act.  He also complimented Secretary 
Spellings for her announcement, in her remarks earlier that day 
at the Global Policy Summit, to commit USD 1.5 million to create 
a center to help colleges and universities develop and expand 
programs for students with intellectual disabilities. He 
described this as an important step. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Secretary Spellings thanked President Grimsson for his 
comments and said she will convey his thanks, and request for 
additional support, back to the President and the U.S. Congress.

U.S. Side: Secretary Spellings, Consul General Kenneth Jarrett, 
Susan Berchelmann (Department of Education), and notetaker 
Joshua Harman.
