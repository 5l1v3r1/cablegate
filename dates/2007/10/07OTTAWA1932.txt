SUBJECT: CANADA MAKES AUNG SAN SUU KYI AN HONORARY CITIZEN 
 
 
¶1. (U) On October 17, the Parliament of Canada unanimously adopted a 
motion from Prime Minister Stephen Harper to make Aung San Suu Kyi 
an honorary Canadian citizen "as a demonstration of Canada's support 
for the people of Burma in their struggle against the brutal 
military dictatorship that rules their country."  The government had 
announced its intention to seek this honor in its "Speech from the 
Throne" to open the new parliamentary session on October 16. 
 
¶2. (U) The text of the motion is as follows: 
"That, Whereas Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of Burma's National 
League for Democracy, has been recognized with the Nobel Peace Prize 
as one of the world's leading champions of peace, democracy and 
non-violence; 
Whereas she has been repeatedly deprived of her liberty and contact 
with her family since July 1989 as retribution for her support for 
the cause of freedom, democracy, human rights and justice for the 
people of Burma; 
Whereas she led the National League for Democracy to victory in 
multi-party democratic elections in 1990, the results of which were 
ignored by the military regime; 
Whereas she remains one of the leading forces in the continuing 
struggle for democracy and human rights in Burma and a symbol of the 
desire of the people of Burma for political freedom; 
Whereas recent events show that her desire for democracy and peace 
is deeply shared by the people of that country; 
Whereas her long struggle to bring freedom and democracy to the 
people of Burma has made her the embodiment of these ideals and an 
inspiration to all of us; 
Whereas Canada has previously acknowledged the contribution of other 
leading champions of human dignity, granting them honorary Canadian 
citizenship; 
Therefore, this House resolves to bestow the title "Honorary 
Canadian Citizen" on Aung San Suu Kyi and requests that the people 
of Canada demonstrate their friendship and solidarity with Aung San 
Suu Kyi as an honorary citizen of Canada and, through her, to the 
people of Burma." 
 
¶3.  (U) Referring to public protests in support of the Burmese 
people in cities across Canada in recent weeks, PM Harper said that 
Canadians "want us to act and we must."  He expressed hope that the 
motion would send the clear signal that Canada stands for universal 
values that are under siege today in Burma, and also send a message 
to Aung San Suu Kyi that Canadians, and all civilized people of the 
world, "stand behind her in her quest for democracy and freedom." 
 
¶4. (U) Foreign Minister Maxime Bernier separately issued a statement 
saluting Aung San Suu Kyi, in which he asserted that Canada stands 
alongside those who share values of freedom, democracy, human rights 
and the rule of law.  He stated that the parliamentary motion 
"reinforces our consistent calls to the government of Burma, through 
the United Nations and other means, to release all political 
prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, to respect the human rights 
and fundamental freedoms of the people of Burma, and to engage in a 
genuine dialogue with the democratic opposition." He confirmed 
Canada's strong support for the visits of the UN Special Envoy to 
Burma and the region, and called on the government of Burma to 
facilitate the Envoy's work.
