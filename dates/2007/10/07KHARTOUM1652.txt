SUBJECT: SPLM MINISTERIAL SUSPENSION OF PARTICIPATION ESCALATES WITH 
WAR OF WORDS 
 
 
 REF: (A) KHARTOUM 1612 
 (B) KHARTOUM 1620 
 (C) KHARTOUM 1628 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: The October 11 Sudan People's Liberation Movement 
(SPLM) Ministerial level suspension of participation in the 
Government of National Unity (GoNU) continues, with each side 
resorting to a war of words, through press statements and in public 
fora.  The SPLM remained firm in their resolve to maintain the 
walkout, while the ruling National Congress Party (NCP) continued to 
publicly urge the SPLM to end their action.  Most recently, 
President Omar Al-Bashir, in his address to the National Assembly on 
October 23, said that participation is the best way to implement the 
Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA).  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) After the SPLM announced the Ministerial-level suspension 
from the GoNU on October 11 (ref B), the NCP addressed the SPLM 
accusations to the diplomatic community (ref A). On October 16, 
President Bashir's reshuffled  the cabinet meeting one of the SPLM 
demands (ref C). On October 18, First Vice President Kiir and 
President Bashir met, but without result, with the two parties only 
stating that they would meet again on October 24. 
 
¶3. (SBU) On October 23, the pro-SPLM "Khartoum Monitor" headline 
proclaimed that Kiir affirmed that the "SPLM continues boycott." 
This followed statements reported by the Monitor on October 22, 
quoting National Deputy Speaker Atem Garang saying that SPLM will 
not recognize any laws approved by a cabinet without the 
participation of the SPLM. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The pro-government "Sudan Vision" on October 23 headlined 
Minister of Justice Mohamed Ali Mardi saying that the SPLM 
ministerial suspension of participation was a violation of the CPA. 
However, he added that the NCP "does not want to escalate the 
crisis."  However, Mardi singled out SPLM hardliner Pagan Amum for 
his lack of moderation and criticized him, Yassir Arman and Deng 
Alor for "provocation statements."  The government-controlled press 
agency SUNA and government-leaning paper "Al-Ayaam," reported Second 
Vice President Ali Osman Taha saying that the NCP will not be 
pressured by political threats and pointed to Sudan People's 
Liberation Army movements along the north/south border as a 
violation of the CPA. 
 
¶5. (SBU) On October 23, during the inaugural session of the National 
Assembly, President Bashir called on the SPLM to rejoin the 
government, pointing out that participation in the government is the 
best way to implement the peace agreement.  Bashir said that the 
decision to suspend participation has, "... brought dispute and 
conflict [between the Parties] where there was consultation and 
cooperation."  He said that peace is a mutual responsibility and not 
a "selective responsibility" that allows one party [read: the SPLM] 
to accuse the other of misfeasance.  He called peace "a continuous 
process," adding that implementation of the CPA has mechanisms in 
the event of dispute.
