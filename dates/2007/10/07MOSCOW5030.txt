¶1. (SBU)  Summary: On October 15, Embassy met with Larissa 
Arap immediately after her return from the United States, in 
order to discuss problems that she and her family were 
reportedly facing in Murmansk and the case she has brought 
against the psychiatric hospital that had held her against 
her will during the summer, and which will be heard by a 
Murmansk court on October 17 (reftels). Arap clarified that 
she is not in danger of being re-institutionalized as a 
result of the case to be heard on October 17.  She provided 
us with contact information for her and her associates, and 
the Embassy provided her with contact information for the 
Consulate in St. Petersburg.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On October 15, Embassy met with Murmansk-based 
United Civic Front (UCF) activist Larissa Arap immediately 
after her return to Russia from a trip to the United States. 
(Arap --reftels-- had been involuntarily institutionalized in 
Murmansk in July, allegedly because of comments she had made 
to the media about her treatment during an earlier 
hospitalization in a psychiatric institution.)  Arap, who 
appeared anxious, was accompanied by Marina Litvinovich, 
Director of the Aid to Victims of Terror Foundation, and 
Denis Bilunov, UCF Executive Director. Arap described 
anonymous threats that she had received before her trip to 
the United States; some sent as text messages to her mobile 
phone.  Bilunov quoted one such threat, that warned Arap that 
if she traveled to the United States "you and your family 
will have problems." Arap said that neither she nor her 
family had received any threats after she left for the United 
States. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Arap reported that her daughter had been fired from 
her job in a public relations firm before Arap's visit to the 
United States, allegedly because of the publicity generated 
by Arap's case.  Arap said she feared retribution from both 
the hospital and local authorities upon her return to 
Murmansk.  She feared that the Apetity psychiatric hospital, 
where she had been institutionalized in July, would again try 
to institutionalize her.  She also said that she feared for 
her physical safety, although she had received no specific 
threats of violence.  Arap said that many negative stories 
about her had already been aired on Murmansk television. 
 
¶4. (SBU) On October 17, Arap will appear in the same court 
that upheld the legality of her July hospitalization in a 
case that she has brought against the Apetity psychiatric 
hospital. Contrary to reports circulating after her visit to 
the United States, Arap insisted that she is not in danger of 
being reinstitutionalized at this hearing.  Arap and Bilunov 
claimed that they "have absolutely no chance" of winning this 
case, given that this court already sided with the hospital 
in an earlier case on the same issue (ref a).  The trial was 
necessary, however, step in order allow the case to be 
considered by an appellate court. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Poloff provided contact information to Arap and her 
colleagues for both the Embassy and the Consulate in St. 
Petersburg.  He  asked that they keep the Consulate informed 
of her circumstances in Murmansk and of the outcome of the 
case. Embassy recommended that Arap bring any further 
developments to the attention of the Human Rights Ombudsman's 
office, since it had worked to secure her release in August 
(ref b).
