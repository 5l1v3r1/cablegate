SUBJECT: CANADA SEEKS HIGH-LEVEL U.S. PARTICIPATION IN PRT 
CONFERENCE 
 
 
¶1.   (SBU) Please see action request in para. 4. 
 
¶2.   (SBU) On October 22, Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade (DFAIT) Afghanistan Task Force Operations 
Officer David Fairchild raised the upcoming November 25-27 
PRT conference in Lithuania entitled "Provincial 
Reconstruction Teams in Afghanistan: Today and Beyond."  (He 
explained that the Canadian and Lithuanian Embassies in 
Washington had sent a formal invitation letter to the State 
Department on October 22; Embassy will provide a copy to 
WHA/CAN.)  Fairchild said DFAIT's new Assistant Deputy 
Minister responsible for Afghanistan, Yves Brodeur, would 
represent Canada at the meeting.  Most of the 23 
participating countries and IOs would likely have similarly 
high level representation, he noted, adding that NATO planned 
to send its Deputy SYG. 
 
¶3.   (SBU) Fairchild admitted that the timing of the 
conference was unfortunate in terms of senior U.S. 
representation, given the conflict with the U.S. Thanksgiving 
holiday.  He nonetheless expressed Canada's hope that the 
U.S. would send a high-level official to participate in the 
meeting, suggesting PM Acting Assistant Secretary Stephen 
Mull. 
 
¶4.   (SBU) Action request:  Please advise about U.S. 
participation in this worthwhile event.
