REF: A. A) 06 STATE 160771 
     ¶B. B) 06 OTTAWA 3434 
     ¶C. C) 06 THE HAGUE 2453 
 
¶1.  (U) In accordance with ref A, Consul paid a site visit to 
the headquarters of Provincial Aerospace Ltd. in St John's, 
Newfoundland on October 3.  Provincial Aerospace is the parent 
company of Provincial Aviation Maintenance Services Inc., the 
foreign consignee named in subject application to purchase 
inertial navigation systems from Honeywell International. 
Consul met with General Manager Brendan Power, who provided a 
tour of the company's facility at the St. John's International 
Airport and answered questions regarding this transaction and 
Provincial Aerospace's business operations. 
 
¶2.  (U) The site visit confirmed much of the information 
regarding Provincial Aerospace that was detailed in refs B and 
¶C.  The two inertial navigation systems had arrived on time and 
were being installed in two Provincial-owned, Canadian-built 
Bombardier DASH-8 aircraft at the hanger in St. John's.  The 
installation and maintenance on the aircraft was ongoing at the 
time of Consul's visit, and she was able to tour the hangar and 
see the subject aircraft as well as two other aircraft that were 
being fitted for a separate contract. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) According to Mr. Power, Provincial has signed a 
10-year contract with the Government of The Netherlands to fly 
and maintain the two aircraft for use in maritime, 
anti-narcotic, and search-and-rescue patrols in the Netherlands 
Antilles, operating out of Curacao.  He stated that they have 
similar contracts with the governments of Canada, Barbados, 
Trinidad and Tobago, Colombia and Peru.  He also reported that 
they are in the process of ending a contract with the Government 
of Venezuela that had been entered into several years ago 
through the U.S. Department of State.  Representatives from the 
United Arab Emirates were also in St. John's on October 3 to 
discuss a potential maritime aviation contract, and Mr. Power 
reported that he has visited UAE several times this year. 
 
¶4. (U) Comment: Aside from the Blue Lantern requirements, it is 
worth noting that Provincial Aerospace appears to be an 
impressive economic success story in Newfoundland.  Power 
reported that the company has grown from 36 employees to 600 
employees in less than 19 years, and that almost all of their 
employees are from Newfoundland.  The company is privately-owned 
by two Newfoundlanders and is one of the largest companies in 
the province.  More information on the company can be found at 
their website www.provincialaerospace.com .  End Comment.
