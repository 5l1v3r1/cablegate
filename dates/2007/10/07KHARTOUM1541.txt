FORMS 
 
----------------------------------- 
WORKING GROUP TO BUILD CFC CAPACITY 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Neither the First nor Second Chamber of the Cease-fire 
Commission (CFC) met the week of September 24 because Force 
Commander Agwai had left for Nigeria and Deputy Force Commander 
Karake was traveling the area of operation.  The working group, 
however, addressed the two general topics of internal 
procedures/incident tracking and actual investigations/training. 
The Secretariat has a good form for logging and tracking cases, but 
it has not been updated nor used since July.  It also does not have 
an entry for follow-up action nor are open cases from the log 
automatically placed on the weekly agenda. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The working group also discussed the Investigations SOP 
draft prepared by the US Observer with input from CivPol 
investigations and former US Observers.  Most of the substantive 
discussion (which at times became quite animated) revolved around 
witness questioning and when to put opinions in the report.  There 
was considerable disagreement over the best way to get out all the 
facts but avoid witness intimidation.  There was also considerable 
disagreement as to whether the investigators' opinions should be 
limited to the final section of the report or be used throughout to 
provide context.  Once the Secretariat completes its draft version, 
the CFC AMIS and CivPol representatives will be invited to join the 
working group to develop the SOP further before it is presented to 
each chamber of the CFC. 
 
----------------- 
A FRESH APPROACH? 
----------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) The new head of the CFC Secretariat arrived just as Agwai 
announced his desire to reform the CFC.  In addition, under the 
Light Support Package (LSP), a Dutch Army officer with a military 
police background has been assigned to the CFC Secretariat, which 
might bring fresh thinking to the operation.  The UN and U.S. 
observers are also trying to help the CFC Secretariat develop 
capacity in doing basic staff work, such as coordination, follow up 
and follow through, and taking the initiative.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) The creation of the working group, and its work so far, are 
a good start, and the UN and U.S. observers will remain engaged. 
However, the biggest challenge facing the CFC now is that it lacks 
the ability to conduct independent investigations.  End comment.
