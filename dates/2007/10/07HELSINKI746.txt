(SBU) PolChief and PolOff delivered subject demarche to Burma 
Deskoff Theresa Zitting October 2. Zitting assured us that 
the EU is considering a draft to strengthen sanctions and 
further visa restrictions against new groups and levels of 
persons, while also seeking to target them in a way that does 
not hurt the Burmese civilians.  She expects consensus among 
the EU.  Zitting indicated strong Finnish national support 
for new sanctions, pointing to a GOF statement condemning 
violence by the Burmese Regime.  The Finnish Ambassador to 
Burma (resident in Thailand) traveled from Thailand to Burma 
on Sunday and Zitting said she would share the read-out from 
his trip with us once she receives it.
