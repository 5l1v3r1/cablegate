SUBJECT:  IRISH PRIME MINISTER BEATS BACK VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE, BUT 
CORRUPTION INVESTIGATION CONTINUES 
 
REF:  (A) DUBLIN 428; (B) DUBLIN 373; (C) 06 DUBLIN 1119 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  During September, the Mahon Tribunal continued 
to investigate allegations that Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern 
was given cash in return for favors in the early 1990s - grilling 
him during three days of hearings.  Political opponents, scenting 
blood, introduced a vote of no confidence against him in the 
Parliament on September 26.  While few believe that Ahern took 
bribes for personal gain and he easily beat back the vote of no 
confidence, he has not put these allegations of corruption behind 
him - the Tribunal continues to deliberate.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  (U) Persistent allegations of irregular financial affairs in the 
early 1990s, which have publicly dogged Irish Prime Minister 
(Taoiseach) Bertie Ahern for more than a year (Reftels), flared into 
the public spotlight again in September.  The Mahon Tribunal, 
created to inquire into allegations of corruption in the granting 
planning permission while Ahern was Minister for Finance, resumed 
sitting on May 28.  (The Tribunal judges had suspended hearings in 
the run-up to the May 2007 national elections, which Ahern and his 
Fianna Fail party handily won (Ref A).) 
 
¶3.  (U) The Mahon Tribunal is specifically investigating claims by a 
property developer that Ahern was given cash in return for his 
support for the development of a Dublin shopping centre - a claim 
Ahern denies.  Tribunal Lawyers have questioned Ahern on cash 
deposits into his accounts (and to those of his then partner Celia 
Larkin) totaling more than 180,000 Irish pounds in 1994 and 1995. 
Ahern, who spent a total of 16 hours over three days in September 
appearing before the Tribunal, says the money came from savings and 
goodwill loans during a marital separation.  Some partisan 
observers, however, allege that Ahern failed to give a full and 
frank accounting of his financial dealings during the period and 
claim his evidence was contradictory.  The Tribunal, which continues 
its investigation, has the right to recall Ahern at a future date. 
(Note:  John Bruton, EU Ambassador to the U.S., who was an 
opposition Fine Gael leader during the period in question, is due to 
appear before the Tribunal on October 18.) 
 
¶4.  (U) Prompted by the allegations of corruption, Fine Gael, the 
largest opposition party, tabled a motion of no confidence in Ahern 
in the Parliament (Dail Eireann) on September 26.  Ahern, supported 
by his Fianna Fail party and coalition partners (the Green Party and 
the Progressive Democrats) easily beat back the vote, 81 to 76. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Comment:  Almost no one believes that Ahern took bribes 
for personal gain; his frugal lifestyle is apparent to all. 
Nonetheless, political opponents scent blood and continue to 
highlight alleged inconsistencies in his testimony in the hopes of 
damaging his political credibility.  Though Ahern easily overcame 
the vote of no confidence, he is not out of the woods.  Allegations 
of corruption are certain to be raised again in coming months.  End 
comment.
