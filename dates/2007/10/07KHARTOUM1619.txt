REF: KHARTOUM 1599 
 
¶1. (SBU) On October 16, CDA Powers and DLO representative met 
Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs Mutriff Siddiq to inquire 
about GoS flight clearances for USAF C-17s that the U.S. 
proposed to airlift the scheduled deployment of Rwanda troops 
to Darfur.  CDA Powers noted that since CDA Fernandez had 
raised the issue with the MFA on October 9 (reftel), U.S. 
planning had advanced with the first flight notionally 
scheduled to start on October 18.  As is routine for 
requested flight clearances, CDA gave Siddiq four diplomatic 
notes requesting flight clearances for the intial proposed 
USAF flights. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Siddiq said that since the October 9 meeting, the 
GoS had discussed the proposal and was "receptive to the 
idea."  He added that the U.S. proposal should be supported 
by a formal African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) request for 
flight clearances via diplomatic note.  Siddiq said that GoS 
would be able to reply to the proposal  following formal 
diplomatic note requests from the U.S and the AMIS. Noting 
the urgency of the matter, Siddiq said that while the AMIS 
notes are being prepared, he would &prepare a reply.8 
 
¶3. (SBU) Siddiq said that it normally takes 72 hours to 
provide flight clearances. He emphasized that "we have told 
all of the Diplomatic Missions about this requirement." He 
added that notwithstanding the failure to comply with this 
requirement, "We will try to meet the target dates." 
 
¶4. (SBU) Emboffs shared copies of the notes fiven to the MFA 
with AMIS, and requested them to send a parallel diplomatic 
note endorsing U.S. efforts to deploy AU-UN troops and asking 
the MFA for the necessary flight clearances.  We informed 
them of urgency of the situation given the timetable for 
deployment.
