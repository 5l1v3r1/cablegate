Â¶1. (SBU) On October 29, Polecoff met with Kadri Jogi, Middle East 
Desk Officer and Annilee Poolekese, Terrorism and Cyber Security Desk 
Officer to discuss reftel.  According to Jogi, the Government of 
Estonia (GOE) strongly condemns PKK activities, in particular those 
which have resulted in the deaths of Turkish military personnel. 
Within the framework of the EU, the GOE has emphasized the need for 
the Government of Turkey (GOT) and the Government of Iraq (GOI) to reac 
a diplomatic, non-military solution to this issue.  The GOE would like 
to see the GOI (specifically Kurdistan) take more measures to halt the 
PKK's armed military activities and to secure a peaceful border with 
Turkey.  Jogi emphasized the GOE's position that EU member states 
should not support organizations which use military methods to 
achieve political goals.
