SUBJECT: SUBJECT: BRAZIL: PROBABLY WILL SUPPORT ARGENTINA 
AT INTERPOL GENERAL ASSEMBLY VOTE ON AMIA CASE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 147320 
 
Classified By: Classified by Political Counselor Stephen M. Liston.  Re 
asons: 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1. (C) On 29 October, Poloffs delivered reftel demarche to 
director of the Brazilian Ministry of External Relations 
(Itamaraty) Office of Transnational Crimes, Virginia 
Toniatti. While Toniatti was familiar with the AMIA case and 
the upcoming Interpol General Assembly vote, and noted 
Brazil,s continuing solidarity with Argentina for the 
attacks it suffered in 1992 and 1994, she indicated that the 
Interpol vote was still under deliberation within the 
Brazilian Government.  When Poloff remarked that Brazil's 
voice carried weight in Lusophone countries in Africa and 
that perhaps Brazil could act as an interlocutor on behalf of 
Argentina, particularly in countries where Argentina lacks an 
Embassy, Toniatti was non-committal and noted that Argentina 
had not requested such actions on Brazil's part. 
 
¶2. (C) Although Toniatti did not explicitly state Brazil 
would vote to confirm Interpol Executive Committee's 
unanimous recommendation to issue the red notices, in a 
conversation with Guillermo Devoto, Political Counselor for 
Internal Affairs at the Argentine Embassy, Devoto informed 
Poloff that Argentina's Minister-Counselor in Brasilia had 
raised the upcoming vote with both Itamaraty and the 
Brazilian Federal Police and both had given full assurances 
that Brazil would support Argentina's position at Interpol. 
 
¶3. (C) COMMENT:  Despite Toniatti's less than definitive 
answer on whether Brazil would vote to issue the red notices 
and her reluctance to carry any water for the Argentines with 
Lusophone Africa, Toniatti's general expressions of support 
for Argentina's effort to bring the perpetrators of the AMIA 
attack to justice and the comments by Argentine Embassy 
contacts leave no reason to believe Brazil will vote against 
issuing the notices.  END COMMENT.
