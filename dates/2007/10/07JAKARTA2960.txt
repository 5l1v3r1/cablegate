SUBJECT: ASEAN SECRETARIAT UPDATE ON BURMA AND CHARTER 
 
REF: A) Jakarta 2817 
 
¶1. (SBU) Embassy met with Dhannan Sunoto, Principal Director of the 
ASEAN Secretariat's Bureau for External Relations, on October 22 to 
discuss the situation in Burma and the latest status of the ASEAN 
Charter.  UN Special Envoy Ibrahim Gambari had met with ASEAN 
Secretary General Ong Keng Yong on October 19, and while Sunoto was 
 
SIPDIS 
not privy to their discussions, he did offer an update on the 
Secretariat's position on Burma and hopes for the ASEAN Charter, due 
 
SIPDIS 
to be signed next month in Singapore. 
 
 
ASEAN ENGAGEMENT ON BURMA 
-------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Secretariat officials acknowledge that ASEAN does not have 
a united strategy on how to deal with Burma, but they continue to 
emphasize that economic engagement, not isolation, will lead to 
positive change.  Secretariat officials agree that ASEAN can serve 
as an interlocutor in the Burma issue but feel that, based on past 
experience, the Burmese regime would not welcome an official ASEAN 
envoy in addition to UN Special Envoy Ibrahim Gambari.    Sunoto 
opined that the Burmese regime prefers dealing with the UN over 
ASEAN, citing Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid's failed effort 
to engage with Burma as an ASEAN envoy in 2006.  The Burmese 
government, after delaying Hamid's visit, barred him from meeting 
with top leadership and Aung San Suu Kyi. 
 
STATUS OF ASEAN CHARTER 
------------------------ 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Secretariat continues to speculate that member 
countries will continue with the ASEAN Charter signing next month as 
scheduled but may delay Burma's signature until the next summit (see 
reftel A).  Given the importance of this milestone in ASEAN 
integration, member countries do not want Burma to be a barrier to 
progress. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In an aside, Sunoto also stated that the draft of the ASEAN 
Charter is complete from the Secretariat's perspective but worried 
that the Thai parliament's review could lead to last-minute changes 
and potential delays prior to the Charter signing.  The Secretariat 
expected the Charter signing to be a primarily symbolic gesture, as 
member governments will then have to individually ratify its 
contents after the summit. Secretariat officials hope that the Thai 
government's more thorough up-front review will not hinder the 
signing next month and will lead to a smoother ratification process 
after the summit.
