REF: NDJAMENA 798 
 
¶1.  (SBU) No progress has been made in the more than five 
days of contacts between members of the Chadian Tubu 
community and the MDJT rebel group currently holding Amcit 
Steve Godbolt in Zoumri, northern Chad. The local Radio 
France International (RFI) reporter had agreed to temporarily 
hold off on releasing the story at the request of Godbolt's 
colleagues in N'Djamena in order to let these discussions run 
their course.  However, we understand that RFI will break the 
story today. 
 
¶2.  (U) The incident has received no press coverage locally. 
A posting on the Paris-based Chadian opposition website 
Al-Wihda (widely read throughout N'Djamena) from the FLST 
(Libyan Front for the Promotion of the Libyan Tubus) states 
that an American (not named) had been seized by Libyan 
intelligence agents with the support of the MDJT, headed by 
Choua Dazi.  The FLST release states that the American had 
defended the cause of the oppressed Libyan Tubus, and for 
this reason had been the target of the Libyan authorities. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Godbolt's colleagues in N'Djamena reported to CDA 
that the Libya-based MDJT leader Choua Dazi has insisted that 
he will only talk to "Americans" concerning the detention. 
(Note: They have heard this second-hand through the Tubu 
acquaintances who have attempted to intervene on behalf of 
Godbolt. End note) 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Post will send a diplomatic note to the Government 
of Chad alerting them to the situation and asking for their 
assistance in seeking the release of Godbolt.  We note that 
the Government of Chad has historically had a small 
administrative presence (and weak authority) throughout much 
of the MDJT-dominated Tibesti region. 
 
¶4. Minimized considered.
