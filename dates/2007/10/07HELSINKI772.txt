REF: STATE 141316 
 
¶1. (U) PolChief delivered subject demarche to Finnish MFA EU 
Correspondent Leena-Kaisa Mikkola Oct. 11.  Mikkola offered 
the following: 
 
¶2. (SBU) KOSOVO: Mikkloa said the GOF is focused now on 
ensuring that legal and logistical mechanisms are in place to 
ensure a continuing international presence in Kosovo 
following Dec. 10 and the expected Kosovar unilateral 
declaration of independence.  The GOF fully shared our views 
on all demarche points. 
 
¶3. (SBU) RUSSIA:  Finland remains very frustrated with the 
lack of forward movement on a new Partnership and Cooperation 
Agreement mandate, stalled since the Russian-Polish meat 
export dispute derailed conclusion of a deal during the 
Finnish presidency.  However, FM Ilkka Kanerva will likely 
raise the issue, given the important role an EU-Russia PCA 
plays within Finland's own national foreign policy toward 
Russia.  Overall, the GOF shares the generally expressed 
opinions view that expectations for this Summit should remain 
low, given that EU-Russia relations "are not exactly in top 
form right now." 
 
¶4. (SBU) LIBYA: The GOF is pleased that trans-Atlantic 
efforts appear to be producing results in Libya.  Signs have 
emerged, however, that Libya is "not enthusiastic" about some 
of the obligations it agreed to (i.e., in the area of Human 
rights) when it entered into Barcelona Process cooperation 
with the EU.  Nevertheless, the EU will continue cooperation 
with Libya and welcomed the Secretary's announced visit 
there, Mikkola said. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Briefly on IRAN, Mikkola said that the Luxembourg 
GAERC will not result in "new, defined EU autonomous 
sanctions."  However, many member states are interested in 
exploring that possibility and there may be some "indication 
of a way forward" after FM Kouchner briefs the GAERC. 
 
¶6. (SBU) SYRIA-LEBANON BORDER: Mikkola was somewhat 
optimistic about the future of this issue, given that Syria 
appeared to be showing much more flexibility than previously 
toward the border mission.  Finland, like other MS, is 
awaiting the results of the EU's fact-finding mission, but is 
hopeful that the mission will occur and will likely make a 
small contribution of border monitors when and if it comes 
together.
