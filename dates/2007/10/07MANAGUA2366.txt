SUBJECT:  MANAGUA SITREP 1 AND COM DISASTER DECLARATION MESSAGE 
 
¶1. (U) This cable includes a COM disaster declaration.   The US 
Ambassador to Nicaragua requests authority for $50,000 for immediate 
disaster response.  Funds will be programmed with local partners to 
meet the most urgent needs.  Programming details will follow.  See 
Para 7 
 
¶2. (U) Summary:  A low pressure system stalled over the Yucatan 
peninsula around the 9th of October, setting up a weather pattern 
that has continued to drop rain in many parts of Central America. 
The northern Pacific coast of Nicaragua has been especially hard hit 
by that phenomenon and the subsequent weather patterns have 
continued to produce precipitation in that area of the country.  The 
areas of Chinandega and Leon have been particularly affected, with 
thousands of families being evacuated to escape the threat from 
flooding or possible landslides from the areas near the Telica and 
San Cristobal volcanoes.  President Ortega appeared on local 
television from Matagalpa discussing the problems on 18 October, 
¶2007. On October 19, 2007, the first lady read a disaster 
declaration for the entire country on television asking for 
international assistance. 
 
¶3. (U) On 14 October, the La Prensa newspaper reported that 
President Ortega declared a red alert for the Department of 
Chinandega on the basis of floods that in the area.  The official 
report from Civil Defense for Chinandega lists 4,210 people 
affected, 2048 evacuated, 19 shelters operating, and more than 533 
kilometers of roads infrastructure damaged by the flood waters.  The 
crop for the 3rd growing season was destroyed for many families, 
prompting widespread concerns about food security for the affected 
area.  All except 3 of Chinandega's shelters were deactivated when 
the alert level was reduced from red to green yesterday.  This 
change was announced at a meeting in Chinandega between the local 
and national officials.  Local leaders disagreed with this decision 
 
 
¶4. (U) The runoff effects from the mountains in the north have 
continued to put pressure on rivers and tributaries causing many to 
overflow there banks.  At about 1030 p.m. on the evening of 17 
October, the Rio Grande River went over its banks in the city of 
Matagalpa, reportedly flooding additional homes, affecting another 
1,710 persons and causing local officials to open 14 more shelters. 
Additionally, 5 people were reported to have died, and another 2 
disappeared.  Infrastructure- 270 homes affected, (250 of those 
semi-destroyed) 250 km of road and 6 bridges affected  These numbers 
are reflected in Civil Defense preliminary report (3rd special part, 
dated 18 Oct.)  Numbers in the national press are dramatically 
higher. 
 
¶5.  (U) During a press conference at 1:30 p.m. today, First Lady 
Rosario Ortega read a statement that declared a disaster on behalf 
of the government.  In that request the government asked for 
international assistance. From observations in the field by NGO 
partners and international organizations, assistance beyond what the 
government is able to provide to the people affected is necessary. 
This assessment is corroborated by a USAID/OFDA Consultant on the 
ground in the affected area. 
 
¶6.  (U) It is the Ambassador's view that; 
 
-The disaster is beyond Nicaragua's ability to respond 
-Nicaragua will accept USG assistance 
-It is in the interest of the USG to provide assistance. 
 
¶7.   (U)  The Mission continues to access needs as more information 
in coming in from local partners and government officials. 
Preliminary priority needs include local procurement of emergency 
relief items including food, clean water, and the sanitary supplies. 
   Potential partners include Catholic Relief Services, Adventist 
Development and Relief Agency, Project Concern International, or 
Save the Children Foundation among others.
