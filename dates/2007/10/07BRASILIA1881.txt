¶1. (U) On September 24, ESTH Off delivered reftel's demarche and 
draft text of a policy exception for the Nuclear Suppliers Group for 
the U.S.-India 123 Agreement to the Deputy Head of the Ministry of

discussed the draft text, they did not yet have any comments to 
provide. 
 
¶2. (U) On October 2, ESTH Off spoke again with Galvao who said that 
DDS still did not have any official comments on the draft.  However, 
he stated that he expected that Brazil may be able to provide 
feedback over the next few days.  Post will continue to follow up 
with DDS officials and report specific reactions to the draft policy 
exception or comments on it.
