SUBJECT: S/CRS WORKS WITH CHINA ON A RECONSTRUCTION AND 
STABILIZATION WORKSHOP 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: Visiting officials from S/CRS participated 
in a successful Reconstruction and Stabilization Workshop in 
Beijing on October 24-25.  The MFA organized the workshop, 
with attendance by representatives of several Chinese 
ministries.  Each side briefed on its international emergency 
response policies.  In separate meetings with the MFA, S/CRS 
outlined two proposals for future bilateral cooperation.  The 
MFA expressed concern that S/CRS' proposals are ambitious for 
China at the moment, but voiced enthusiasm for continued 
bilateral exchanges of some kind on this issue.   End 
Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) S/CRS officers participated in an October 24-25 
Reconstruction and Stabilization Workshop organized by the 
MFA in Beijing.  S/CRS officials noted shared interest in 
creating a stable global environment in the face of new 
security challenges and the need to expand international 
partnerships.  S/CRS outlined the S/CRS mission for Chinese 
Government officials attending the workshop, explained how 
S/CRS handles planning for reconstruction and stabilization 
and responded to Chinese questions during a question and 
answer session.  The second day of the workshop was devoted 
to a Chinese presentation on Chinese peacekeeping and 
humanitarian efforts abroad.  The Chinese emphasized the 
importance to China of operating under a United Nations 
umbrella and noted that China has yet to engage in larger 
reconstruction and stabilization efforts.  The following 
ministries and entities all presented at the Workshop: MFA, 
Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Public Security, Ministry of 
Civil Affairs, Ministry of Communications, Ministry of 
Commerce, Ministry of Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 
China Meteorological Administration and the Red Cross Society 
of China. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In meetings with MFA officials following the 
workshop, S/CRS proposed two possible next steps to build on 
this new channel of exchange and cooperation.  S/CRS offered 
to host a case-study exercise in which the United States and 
China would work together on a reconstruction and 
stabilization scenario.  MFA International Organizations 
Department Deputy Director Yao Shaojun said that in his 
personal view China should first act as an observer to such 
an exercise before being an actual participant, but stressed 
that China hopes to continue developing bilateral exchanges 
on stabilization and reconstruction and emergency response. 
S/CRS presented a second proposal to bring reconstruction and 
stabilization onto the agenda of the ASEAN Regional Forum 
(ARF).  Yao deferred to his MFA colleagues working in the 
Asia Department but again noted his personal opinion that 
this was perhaps a "bridge too far."  He said he thinks China 
and the United States should initially work together 
bilaterally to build mutual confidence and trust.  S/CRS 
agreed to consult with EAP to prepare a paper for the MFA on 
the U.S. idea of bringing reconstruction and stabilization 
into the ARF to better clarify this idea.
