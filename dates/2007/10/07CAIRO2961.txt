in Cairo (ref A), and detailed the problems facing the South 
Sudanese community in Egypt.  End summary.

¶2. (SBU) On September 30, poloffs paid an introductory call 
on Government of South Sudan (GOSS) liaison office head 
Parmena Makuet Mangar.  Mangar received poloffs warmly, 
emphasizing the "shared values" between the GOSS and the USG 
and thanking poloffs for the USG role in formulating the 2005 
Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA).  Mangar complained that 
the Sudanese government (GOS) is still not in compliance with 
the CPA regarding withdrawal of Sudanese Armed Forces, 
implementing the Abyei Protocols, north/south border 
demarcation, and wealth sharing.  The GOSS is committed to a 
unified Sudan, Mangar said, but these issues "are driving the 
people towards separation" when they vote on Sudanese unity 
in 2011.  Mangar asked for continued USG support on these 
issues; poloffs stressed that the USG is calling on all 
parties for full implementation of the CPA.  Mangar also 
thanked the USG for "lifting sanctions on South Sudan," 
though poloffs corrected him, noting that U.S. sanctions on 
Sudan apply to the country as a whole, not just the north.

¶3. (SBU) Mangar said that his office spends much of its time 
assisting the South Sudanese community in Egypt, which Mangar 
estimated at 300,000.  Many South Sudanese are poor and 
cannot find jobs, good education or health care, and some are 
turning to street gangs.  The Egyptian government does not 
have the resources to provide for them, Mangar said - 
"Egyptians are poor too."  Mangar says his office is 
constantly trying to assist South Sudanese who would like to 
return home, but they are facing a prohibitively arduous and 
expensive journey (ref B).  On education in particular, 
Mangar said that many South Sudanese, who are raised on 
English instruction, have problems with predominantly Arabic 
instruction in Egypt.  Mangar suggested that the USG work 
with the American University in Cairo to establish 
scholarships for South Sudanese to study there.
