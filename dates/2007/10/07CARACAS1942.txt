accordingly. 
 
¶1. (SBU) According to local media, on September 29, Brazilian 
Foreign Minister Celso Amorim met with President Chavez and 
Foreign Minister Maduro in Caracas to discuss, inter alia, 
Venezuela's Mercosur accession, the status of the South 
American gas pipeline project, and bilateral cooperation in 
tourism, health, agriculture, the communal economy, and 
trade.  The two sides also stressed the importance of the 
Bank of the South and South American integration, and talked 
about plans for the creation of two jointly-owned refineries 
located in Abreu de Lima, in Northeast Brazil, and the other 
in Venezuela's petroleum-rich Orinoco belt.  The visit was 
billed as a follow up to the September 20 Lula-Chavez meeting 
in Manaus, Brazil. 
 
¶2. (SBU) During a post-meeting press conference, Amorim 
expressed the GoB's strong support for Venezuela's Mercosur 
accession, explaining, "the accession of Venezuela is very 
important, it will help us create the backbone for the 
integration of South America, and this has always been our 
vision."  On the Brazilian Congress-Chavez spat (Reftel A), 
Amorim explained, "the Brazilian Congress has the autonomy to 
make its own decisions, but the government of President Lula 
was confident that it would decide in favor of Brazil, the 
integration of Latin American, and also Venezuela."  (Note: 
Chavez has sometimes publicly blamed the USG for the delay in 
Venezuela's Mercosur accession.  End Note.)  During his 
September 30 weekly "Alo Presidente" television program, 
Chavez also announced that he would meet with Lula in either 
October or November to discuss generic drug manufacturing and 
the production of HIV/AIDS drugs.
