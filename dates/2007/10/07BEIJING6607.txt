SUBJECT: OCTOBER 11 MFA PRESS BRIEFING: BURMA, ARREST OF 
DPRK ASYLUM SEEKERS, DALAI LAMA AND MORE 
 
¶1. Key points at the October 11 MFA Press Briefing: 
 
-- The situation in Burma is "relaxing" and is 
"turning in a good direction."  The international 
community should offer "constructive" help to allow 
Burma to realize stability, reconciliation, democracy 
and development. 
 
-- ROK consulate officials "obstructed" Chinese police 
during the October 9 incident at the Korean 
International School and "violated" the Vienna 
Convention.  Chinese security forces acted properly in 
the handling of "four unidentified people" who broke 
into the campus. 
 
-- The PRC "resolutely opposes" the awarding of the 
Congressional Gold Medal to the Dalai Lama and has 
made "solemn" representations to make this position 
clear to the USG. 
 
Burma Unrest 
------------ 
 
¶2. At the October 11 regular MFA press briefing, MFA 
Spokesman Liu Jinchao said the situation in Burma 
(referred to as "Myanmar") has "relaxed" and is 
"turning in a good direction."  The international 
community should help Burma in "a constructive way" to 
realize stability, reconciliation, democracy and 
development.  The international community should also 
try to be helpful in the mediation efforts led by the 
UN Secretary General.  (Note: This was mistranslated 
at the press conference as EU Secretary General.) 
 
Arrest of DPRK Asylum Seekers at Korean School 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶3. Chinese police, Liu said, received a report on 
October 9 of "four unidentified people" in the Korean 
International School in Beijing.  Chinese public 
security authorities handled the matter "properly" in 
order to preserve "normal order" and the safety and 
security of faculty and students.  ROK consular 
officials, however, "obstructed" police in disregard 
of international law and "violated" the Vienna 
Convention.  The case is under investigation and will 
be handled properly according to law, Liu added. 
 
Dalai Lama Gold Medal 
--------------------- 
 
¶4. China "resolutely opposes" the decision by the 
United States Congress to award the Dalai Lama with 
the "so-called" Gold Medal.  China has made "solemn" 
representations to make this position clear to the 
USG.  China opposes "interference" by any country or 
person in China's internal affairs under the name of 
religion. 
 
China-Japan Consultation on East China Sea 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶5. The 10th Round of Sino-Japanese consultations on 
the East China Sea took place October 11 in Beijing. 
MFA Department of Asian Affairs Director General Hu 
Zhengyue is heading the Chinese delegation while 
Kenichiro Sasae, Director General of the Japanese 
Foreign Ministry's Asian and Oceanian Affairs Bureau, 
is leading the talks for Japan.  China will press 
ahead in a "pro-active" and "pragmatic" manner to 
reach a plan acceptable to both sides.  Liu said the 
Chinese government hopes Japan can "meet us halfway." 
 
Exchange Rate, EU-China Economic Dialogue 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. A Bloomberg reporter asked Liu whether China would 
be willing to host a meeting with EU Finance Ministers 
along the lines of the U.S.-China Strategic Economic 
Dialogue.  Liu responded that China will continue to 
reform the RMB exchange rate regime.  There are some 
countries, including the EU, that have concerns about 
the exchange rate and China is ready to discuss and 
consult with them on the basis of equality.  Liu, 
however, said questions regarding a possible EU-China 
economic dialogue should be directed to other 
"relevant authorities." 
 
Six-Party Talks, U.S. Team of Experts 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. Liu said he was unaware of any discussions between 
 
BEIJING 00006607  002 OF 002 
 
 
Chinese officials and members of the U.S. team of 
experts traveling to Pyongyang today.  Liu said he 
thought the USG would "exchange views" with the other 
parties in the Six-Party Talks in "due time." 
 
Taiwan: Don't Use the "P" Word 
------------------------------ 
 
¶8. Liu referred a question on China's reaction to 
Taiwan's Double Ten military parade to the State 
Council Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO).  Liu chastised 
another reporter for referring to Taiwan "President" 
Chen Shui-bian.  The term "president" is "inconsistent 
with Taiwan's status," Liu said, adding that "I have 
no comment on this kind of person." 
 
Colombian Peace Process 
----------------------- 
 
¶9. Asked about the efforts of Venezuelan President 
Hugo Chavez to mediate between the Colombian 
government and rebel groups, Liu said the PRC has been 
following closely the Colombian peace process and 
welcomes efforts by Colombia, Venezuela and the 
international community to bring about the early 
release of hostages.
