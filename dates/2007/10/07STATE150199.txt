MORATORIUM ON PLANTING GENETICALLY ENGINEERED CORN SEEDS 
 
REF: PARIS 4170 AND PREVIOUS 
 
1.(SBU) BEGIN SUMMARY:  On October 25, Under Secretary for 
Economic, Energy, and Agricultural Affairs Reuben Jeffery 
III underscored to French Ambassador Pierre Vimont the 
importance of market access in France of U.S. genetically 
engineered (GE) products.  Any decision France reaches 
through the Grenelle process, Jeffery stressed, should be 
consistent with EU law and WTO principles.  Vimont 
acknowledged that France is constrained by EU law in this 
matter.  He suggested that France is most likely to 
establish a scientific authority to look at the question of 
the use of GE products in France. END SUMMARY 
 
2.(SBU) On October 25, U/S Jeffery called Ambassador Vimont 
to raise USG concerns about a possible French ban or 
moratorium on planting genetically engineered (GE) corn 
seeds.  French farmers currently sow approximately 22,000 
hectares with a Monsanto biotech variety.  A ban or 
moratorium could cost the U.S. $30-50 million in exports to 
France. 
 
 
 
3.(SBU) In response to U/S Jeffery's inquiry about the 
status of a possible ban or moratorium on GE corn seeds, 
Vimont said that President Sarkozy will make the final 
decision on outcomes from the Grenelle process.  Vimont 
assured that the French government would try to be as 
balanced as possible.  He indicated that he understood that 
the decision would likely be to establish a scientific 
authority to look at the question of the use of GE products 
in France.  He thought that any process established to 
reach final decisions on the use of GE products would be 
transparent and based on objective and scientific 
assessments.  He added that it would also likely establish 
legal responsibilities regarding potential "pollution," 
including provisions for punishment of convicted polluters. 
 
4.(SBU) U/S Jeffery made clear that market access for U.S. 
GE products is very important for our industry and for 
France's own farmers.  He stressed that any decision France 
makes on the issue should conform to existing EU law and 
WTO rules and therefore not prohibit the use of GE products 
that are approved by the EC.  Vimont acknowledged that 
France is constrained in this matter by existing European 
legislation, and advised that he would report U/S Jeffery's 
demarche to Paris upon his arrival (Vimont was departing 
for a trip to Paris on the evening of October 25).  He 
added that U.S. biotech sector representatives had also 
contacted him regarding this issue.
