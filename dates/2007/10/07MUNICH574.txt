¶1.  ConGen contacted Bernhard Wagner, Managing Director of 
Prueftechnik Dieter Busch AG.  Wagner confirmed that Prueftechnik 
had received all 10 Inertial Sensor Assemblies (ISA) listed on the 
license and assured us the ISAs had been incorporated into 
Prueftechnik's PARALIGN systems. 
 
¶2.  Prueftechnik provided ConGen a list identifying which specific 
ISA had been incorporated into which PARALIGN machine.  Prueftechnik 
stated that the sets of gyros are firmly integrated into the 
PARALIGN systems and cannot be easily transferred from one machine 
to the other.   Prueftechnik confirmed the sets of gyros 
incorporated into the PARALIGN systems would be used by Prueftechnik 
and its subsidiaries for demonstration purposes at trade shows. 
 
¶3.  Post found no indication that Prueftechnik is acting in a manner 
inconsistent with U.S. export controls, or was not forthcoming in 
its answers to our questions. 
 
¶4.  This report has been coordinated with Embassy Berlin. 
 
¶5.  Previous reporting from Munich is available on our SIPRNET 
website at www.state.sgov.gov/p/eur/munich/ .
