¶1. (SBU) Summary. In its October 2007, GlobeAsia (a respected 
Indonesian business magazine) ranked Minister of Health Fadilah 
Supari as number 16 of the top 99 Most Powerful Women in Indonesia. 
On October 1, the National Institute of Health Research and 
Development (NIHRD) confirmed H5N1 in a deceased patient, raising 
total Indonesian cases to 107 with 86 deaths.  On September 17, the 
Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) along with USAID and other 
stakeholders agreed to implement an immediate action plan to reduce

conduct a field simulation exercise for rapid containment of 
human-to-human transmission of avian influenza in March 2008. End 
Summary.

SUPARI MAKES INDONESIA'S MOST POWERFUL WOMEN LIST 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶2. (U) In its October 2007 issue, GlobeAsia (a monthly Indonesian 
business magazine) ranked Minister of Health Supari as number 16 of 
99 Most Powerful Women.  The magazine notes that Supari is "one of 
four women serving in the cabinet of President SBY.  As Minister of 
Health in a nation with more than 225 million people, Siti Fadilah 
has one of the toughest jobs in the country.  But her quiet strength 
and dedication has seen her overcoming a series of health scares 
although she has still to fully overcome the bird flu problem."

NAMRU'S SURVEILLANCE NETWORK PICKS UP LATEST CASE 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) NAMRU-2 identified Indonesia's latest H5N1 case through 
routine testing of samples from its flu surveillance network. The 
sample was from a 21 year old West Jakarta man, who died on 
September 28.  NAMRU-2 shared the sample with NIHRD, which confirmed 
H5N1 virus on October 1.  As of October 1, GOI confirms 107 
Indonesian human cases with 86 deaths. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
IMMEDIATE FOCUS ON REDUCING VIRUS IN POULTRY 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) On September 17, USAID and the MOA held a key partners 
meeting to advance a detailed implementation plan for immediate AI 
control in animals. Agencies represented at the meeting included the 
National Committee for AI Control and Influenza Pandemic 
Preparedness KOMNAS FBPI), USDA, Food and Agriculture Organization, 
World Bank, AusAID, Government of Japan, International Livestock 
Research Institute (ILRI), and Development Alternatives Incorporated 
(a USAID contractor). 
 
¶4. The plan's initial objective is to evaluate poultry vaccine 
efficacy.  Research findings reported earlier this year indicated 
that none of the currently approved vaccines provided significant 
protection from mortality when challenged with a virus recently 
isolated from a flock in West Java.  The partners agreed to a plan 
to simultaneously evaluate the efficacy of existing poultry vaccine 
and develop a new vaccine(s) against the currently circulating 
poultry virus.  Mass vaccination using the identified vaccine will 
take place in West Java Province with its high concentrations of 
both commercial and backyard poultry.  Researchers will evaluate and 
compare the effectiveness of mass vaccination and other control 
strategies in an operational research project under the direction of 
(ILRI). The project will involve several field studies. 
 
 -------------------------------------- 
PANDEMIC INFLUENZA SIMULATION EXERCISE 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) The Minister of Health Siti Fadilah Supari approved that MOH 
will lead a field simulation exercise for the rapid containment of a 
pandemic influenza virus in Bali in March 2008.  Other participants 
will include the Indonesian police and military, quarantine and

disaster management agencies, and KOMNAS.  As a prelude to the March 
field simulation, the MOH is also planning for a tabletop exercise 
in Bali to occur in late October or November.
