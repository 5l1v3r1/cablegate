REF: SECSTATE 144963 
 
¶1. (U) Nicaragua joined the ethanol market in 2007, when 
Nicaraguan Sugar Estates (NSE) started sending shipments of 
sugar cane ethanol to Europe.  NSE hopes to double that 
volume in 2008 when expanded facilities come on line.  Other 
sugar producers have moved to take advantage of world demand 
for ethanol.  Honduran-owned Monte Rosa Sugar, Nicaragua's 
second largest sugar producer, is building an ethanol plant 
and which it hopes to bring it on line this fall. 
Nicaragua's other two sugar producers are contemplating 
whether to join this growing market.  Given the lack of 
infrastructure in Nicaragua to support ethanol use in 
vehicles or industry, all ethanol currently produced is sold 
abroad. 
 
¶2. (U) Despite President Ortega's negative rhetoric regarding 
corn-based ethanol, the GON has no specific policies that 
block ethanol or biofuels production.  Given the sky 
rocketing price of oil, there is strong interest among GON 
officials to explore biofuels, particularly the production of 
diesel from African Palm.  This has encouraged the 
Inter-American Institute for Agricultural Cooperation (IICA) 
to explore the use of African Palm as an alternative fuel 
source for Nicaragua's Atlantic coast. 
 
¶3. (U) Nominees listed below could benefit from participation 
in the proposed CCAA biofuels event.
