(U)  Poloff delivered reftel demarche separately to Juan 
Manuel Linares, Deputy Director General for the United 
Nations, and Alberto Ucelay, Deputy Director General for the 
Middle East, on October 1.  Linares and Ucelay coincided in 
their response that Spain was entering its end of year 
budgetary phase and had no extra funds currently available 
for a contribution to the Lebanon Tribunal.  Linares 
emphasized that Spain is already providing a significant 
financial and military commitment to Lebanon as the third 
leading contributor to UNIFIL and a major provider of 
reconstruction assistance.  Linares noted that budget 
negotiations for MFA are slowly getting underway for FY 2008 
and it is possible that an allocation for voluntary 
contributions could come out of those negotiations, but he 
was not overly optimistic.  Both Linares and Ucelay 
underscored that the MFA is prioritizing its request for an 
'08 allocation for an "important" contribution to the 
Multinational Forces and Observers, which they hoped would be 
successful.  Such a contribution, coupled with their 
continued military and assistance presence in Lebanon, would 
likely be the most Spain could achieve in a tight budgetary 
cycle.  Poloff emphasized that even a symbolic contribution 
from Spain would be greatly appreciated, which Ucelay agreed 
to consider.
