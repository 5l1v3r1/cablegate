¶1. (SBU) Ambassador met October 26 with Foreign Minister 
Zacarias Albano da Costa to urge that Timor-Leste vote against 
Cuba's UNGA resolution condemning the U.S. embargo (reftel A). 
Citing the President's recent speech (reftel B), we said that 
the Castro regime is continuing its longstanding practices of 
political repression, human rights violations, and economic 
mismanagement.  We argued that by shifting the focus on to the 
embargo, the Cuban regime was attempting to blame outside actors 
for its failed policies and deplorable conditions in the country. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Da Costa said he shared our concerns, but that 
Timor-Leste would, as in past years, vote to support Cuba's 
resolution.  He had already instructed Timor-Leste's Mission to 
the U.N. to that effect.  He said that Timor-Leste would, 
however, make a statement of vote expressing concern over the 
Cuban regime's human rights record
