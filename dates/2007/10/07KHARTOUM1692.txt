¶1. SUMMARY:   AEC Chairman Tom Vraalsen convened a special session 
of the AEC plenary on October 27 to discuss how the AEC can best 
move forward.  The AEC Coordinators proposed this meeting to address 
the changed playing field after the SPLM suspended its participation 
in the Government in mid October.  He urged the two sides to agree 
on a detailed action plan with clear objectives and timelines for 
implementation.  In their statements, the NCP and SPLM each 
recapitulated their positions as to who bears responsibility for 
slowing progress on CPA implementation, but each affirmed their 
determination to make progress, and their dedication to the AEC 
process.  In turn, representatives of each of the Working Group 
Coordinators urged the two parties to move forward in a 
problem-solving mode, and pledged that they stand ready to provide 
technical and other assistance to the two parties.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.   AEC Chairman Tom Vraalsen opened the meeting by urging both the 
SPLM and the to focus on the way forward and tackle the remaining 
obstacles to agreement with a problem-solving mindset.  The two 
sides should work to produce an action plan, with clear objectives 
and timelines for implementation.  Vraalsen voiced satisfaction "for 
the support expressed to the AEC in recent days" from a number of 
sources, highlighting the recent statement supporting the AEC by 
Vice President Taha. 
 
NCP and SPLM state commitment to CPA, AEC 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  The SPLM delegates spoke first.  The "action plan" the Chairman 
had requested, they said, had been presented already in the form of 
a list of demands to the NCP.  The SPLM reiterated that it would not 
return to the Government until its demands were met.  In response, 
the NCP rejected the SPLM's implication that the NCP was solely 
responsible for the lack of progress.  The only way forward was to 
continue working through the partnership created by the CPA and its 
various agencies and institutions.  Chief among these bodies was the 
Council of Ministers.  The NCP urged the SPLM to immediately return 
to the Government. 
 
¶4.  The two sides disagreed over a listing of areas for CPA 
implementation which the NCP said had been worked out between State 
Minister Idris Abdelgadir (NCP) and State Minister Telar Deng 
(SPLM).  The NCP said that the understanding reached over the list, 
dated September 18, 2007, was that the two sides would begin work 
immediately after the Eid break, through weekly meetings of the 
Presidency.  The SPLM disputed the validity of that list, saying 
that it was the initiative of two persons and had not been enDorse$
