(U) Poloff delivered reftel demarche and draft text to 
Fernando Fernandez-Arias, Spanish Deputy Director General for 
Human Rights, on October 2.  Fernandez-Arias was very 
appreciative of the draft text, but declined to comment on it 
until he had vetted it through Aurora Mejia, Spanish Special 
Ambassador for the Promotion of Gender Equality Policies, and 
the Spanish Women's Institute at the Ministry of Labor and 
Social Affairs.  Fernandez-Arias said he understood perfectly 
U.S. concerns about co-sponsor amendments that would endanger 
U.S. sponsorship of the resolution, and he noted that Spain 
has a particular and somewhat different approach to these 
issues than the U.S.  He said Spain would have to first 
internally coordinate its position in Madrid before engaging 
in EU coordination in NY on October 4.
