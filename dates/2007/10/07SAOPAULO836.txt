The Militarization of Venezuela 
 
Center-right O Estado de S.Paulo editorialized (10/15): 
"[Venezuelan] opposition parties have started organizing a 
parliamentary resistance against Chavez' machinations such as 
indefinite reelection, destruction of the federative regime...and 
the end of private property.... Chavez accuses these parties and 
their leaders of being traitors of the nation, servants of the 
oligarchy and CIA agents.... Some time ago...[Chavez] adopted 
nazi-fascist methods...he took the pledge of allegiance from the 
party's committee that will organize a referendum...on the new 
constitution...he heard the pledge of 14 thousand "soldiers"...who 
will be responsible for "convincing" Venezuelans that the socialism 
of the 21st century will be Paradise on Earth. Chavez is also 
organizing "troops of support" and "troops of rear-guards"... Chavez 
is putting together as well the National Bolivarian Militia with a 
structure that is parallel to the Armed Forces with the obvious goal 
of defending the interests of the United Socialist Party of 
Venezuela and its supreme leader, not those of the State. Any 
similarity to the nazi SS will not be a mere coincidence.... This is 
the regime President Lula wants as a partner of Mercosul."
