SUBJECT: NICARAGUAN FM SANTOS LETTER TO SECRETARY RICE: 
REQUEST STAY OF DEPORTATIONS AND EXTENSION OF TPS 
 
 
¶1.  (U) On Tuesday, September 25, we received, under cover of 
a Foreign Ministry (MINREX) diplomatic note, a letter to the 
Secretary from Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Samuel Santos. 
The letter thanks the U.S. for assistance rendered during 
Hurricane Felix and, citing the internal displacement and 
destruction caused by Felix, requests that the U.S. 
temporarily suspend all deportation proceedings for 
Nicaraguans as well as extend Temporary Protective Status 
(TPS) until such time as the Government of Nicaragua (GON) 
can adequately receive and reintegrate its citizens.  The 
diplomatic note and signed original letter, all in Spanish, 
have been pouched to the Department (WHA/CEN).  The text of 
the MINREX unofficial English translation of Santos' letter 
is in para 2 below. 
 
¶2. (U) BEGIN TEXT OF UNOFFICIAL ENGLISH TRANSLATION 
 
Your Excellency: 
 
On behalf of my government and of myself, please accept our 
gratitude for all of the help your government has provided to 
the victims of Hurricane Felix.  As you may know, this has 
been one of the worst natural disasters that has affected 
Nicaragua in the last decade.  Our country is still grappling 
with the economic and social aftershocks.  Our attention is 
now centered on trying to bring stability, with dignity, back 
to the areas destroyed and the local economy:  90% of the 
houses (more than 9000) have been ruined, more than 100,000 
Nicaraguans are now without shelter, and the death toll, thus 
far, totals more than 146, with others still missing.  Our 
government has allocated emergency resources to deal with the 
crisis upon us. 
 
As you know, tens of thousands of Nicaraguans live in the 
Unites States.  Your government has now accelerated the 
removal of Nicaraguans and recently a planeload of our 
citizens just arrived in Managua.  They landed as other 
airplanes were bringing resources and emergency aid for the 
victims of Felix.  Given the emergency situation engulfing 
our nation at this point, I respectfully and officially 
request that your government halt removing Nicaraguans until 
we can stabilize the on-going crisis.  In the near future, 
once the statistics for Felix become available, we may ask 
you for additional cooperation in trying to obtain the remedy 
called TPS (Temporary Protected Status) for the victims of 
the aforementioned disaster.  We believe in the principle of 
mutual respect for the internal affairs of all nations.  That 
is why we understand that you have to comply with the 
applicable immigration regulations that may or may not affect 
our citizens. But we believe you have the discretion to act 
at this point, given the situation at hand. 
 
I thank you in advance for your cooperation in this matter. 
And avail myself to reiterate my highest esteem and 
consideration.
