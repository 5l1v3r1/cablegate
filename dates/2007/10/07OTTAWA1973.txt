¶2.  (SBU) Begin text: 
 
Dear General Petraeus, 
 
Thank you for your letter of September 28 and the 
invitation to attend the Coalition Conference on Iraq in 
Bahrain later this month.  Canada appreciates the 
invitation to these important conferences and continues to 
provide assistance to the reconstruction efforts in Iraq. 
 
As you may know, Canada has directed $300m in funding 
toward humanitarian assistance and capacity building in 
Iraq and participates in the International Reconstruction 
Fund Facility for Iraq (IRFFI) as well as the Extended 
Neighbours process. 
 
While we are not in a position to attend the upcoming 
Coalition Conference, Canada remains committed to these 
important efforts. 
 
Yours sincerely, 
 
Colleen Swords 
Assistant Deputy Minister and 
Political Director
