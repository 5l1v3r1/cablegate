Â¶1. (SBU) On October 26, Polecoff spoke with Urmas Eigla, Cuban Desk 
 
Officer at the MFA.  Eigla stated that the Government of Estonia 
(GOE) 
will give careful consideration to the UNGA Resolution, but will 
ultimately support the common EU position.  The GOE feels that 
strong 
and inflexible sanctions and isolationist policies will not 
necessarily 
promote the development of civil society in Cuba.  Eigla also 
commented 
that even though Estonia does not have representation in Cuba, the 
GOE 
strongly supports communication with dissidents and providing them 
with 
support and assistance.
