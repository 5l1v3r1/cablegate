SUBJECT: HUMANITARIAN AGENCY DRIVERS KILLED; AGENCIES WATCH FOR 
IMPACT ON ABILITY TO DELIVER HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE 
 
 
¶1. In two separate incidents, three U.N. World Food Program (WFP) 
contracted drivers were killed in the past week.  On October 16, 
media reported that two drivers were killed in South Darfur while on 
their way back to El Obeid  after delivering their food supplies. 
On October 12, on the road between Nyala and El-Fasher another 
driver was killed and 25 sacks of sorghum were taken. 
 
¶2. Simon Crittle, WFP Communications Director, cited the lack of 
UN/NGO identification as a possible underlying contributing factor 
in the attacks.  He said that the contractor trucks are usually not 
identified as delivering WFP food and can easily be mistaken for 
private trucks that haul produce and supplies. He told poloff that 
most WFP contractors use 15 ton trucks, a variety commonly used on 
the poor roads in Darfur, which  are hard to distinguish from other 
commercial trucks carrying commericial cargo.  (Comment:  There is 
no indication these attacks were motivated by anything other than 
general banditry, which has been on the rise along many routes in 
Darfur for the past several months.  End comment.) 
 
¶3. Crittle said that WFP uses nearly 1,000 such 15 ton trucks, and 
have experienced a number of incidents with them.  They range from 
simple robbery, vehicle hijackings, theft of the cargo, kidnapping 
and, killings.  Crittle told poloff that WFP wanted to draw 
awareness to the deaths to underscore the insecure environment in 
which the humanitarian community is currently operating.  He 
expressed hope that AMIS would be able to provide improved security, 
but acknowledged that they are overstretched.  "The roads are full 
of trucks and commerce.  Robberies and murder probably will continue 
given the large numbers of vehicles that travel." 
 
¶4. USAID reports that at this time there has not been any 
discernible impact on US-funded humanitarian assistance programs. 
However, donors and partners are closely watching for any possible 
effects on their operations as a result of recent attacks.  There 
are only a limited number of commercial trucking agencies that can 
handle the required humanitarian supplies.  WFP, UN Joint Logistics 
Center (UNJLC) and other aid agencies share many of the same firms. 
Should the truckers raise their prices or refuse to drive, 
particularly along selected routes, aid agencies may be constrained 
in delivering of humanitarian supplies in a timely manner. (Note: 
at this time, WFP reports that it has nearly emptied its stocks in 
Port Sudan, and deliveries of food aid are moving ahead as 
scheduled.  In fact, they are looking forward to the next shipments 
of US-donated food supplies, which are due to arrive at the end of 
November.  End note.)
