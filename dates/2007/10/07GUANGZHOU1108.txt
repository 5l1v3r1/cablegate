¶1. (U) Summary: Guangzhou's Panyu District Government lifted a 
21-day quarantine of the area recently affected by an outbreak of 
avian influenza (AI). Before it was lifted, Consulate staff saw a 
few farmers illegally selling birds in the quarantine area. Media 
reports indicate that the Guangzhou Municipal Government has stepped 
up efforts to vaccinate wild birds in parks, zoos, and mountainous 
areas most visited by migratory birds. End summary. 
 
----------------- 
Quarantine Lifted 
----------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Flu antibody samples taken October 7 and 8 from birds in 
the area affected by the recent outbreak have come back negative 
according to Yu Yedong, Director of the Guangdong Provincial 
Veterinary Station of Epidemic Prevention and Supervision. In 
response, Panyu District authorities lifted the 21-day quarantine on 
October 9.  The quarantine had affected 68 poultry and live-animal 
(or "wet") markets. 
 
¶3. (U) After further analysis, the National Avian Influenza 
Reference Lab reported on September 24 that the virus sample from 
the infection site showed no signs of mutation, and that current 
vaccines remain effective. In an effort to explain why the latest 
outbreak infected ducks, which are normally only carriers of the 
virus, some experts speculated that it was caused by farmers 
changing the water in ponds, drawing water from nearby rivers that 
may have been contaminated by local chicken farms. 
 
------------------ 
Black Market Birds 
------------------ 
 
¶4. (U) During a visit while the quarantine was still in effect, 
stalls in most affected poultry markets were empty and had clearly 
been disinfected. However, Consulate staff found a few farmers in 
one area market continued to illegally sell poultry, refusing to 
identify the origin of the birds. Poultry vendors throughout the 
quarantine zone told us that they had not received any subsidies or 
aid from government agencies to compensate them for revenue lost 
during the quarantine. 
 
---------------------------- 
Natural Habitat Vaccinations 
---------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) According to media reports, the Guangzhou Municipal 
Government has expanded its vaccination program to other bird 
habitats, including parks, zoos, and mountainous areas. Wild birds 
will be vaccinated in addition to domestic birds and other birds 
held in captivity.  Officials in these locations must report daily 
to the city's Forestry Bureau regarding the welfare of their bird 
population. In addition, the government also plans to provide weekly 
disinfection of poultry markets and protective clothing for market 
staff. In one area park, officials report that they have vaccinated 
approximately 5,000 birds. The Guangzhou Zoo currently has a 
short-term goal of vaccinating 3,200 birds.
