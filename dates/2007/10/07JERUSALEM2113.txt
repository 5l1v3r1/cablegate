SUBJECT: GAZA CHRISTIAN MURDERED 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary.  The body of Rami Ayyad, an employee of 
the Baptist-affiliated Holy Bible Association, was found in 
Gaza City on October 8, with indications that he was 
murdered.  According to Gaza Governor Muhammad al-Qidwa, 
initial indications point to a hate crime, noting that Ayyad 
had received three death threats before his October 7 
kidnapping and had owned a bookstore previously targeted by 
the "Army of Islam."  PA Information Minister Riyad Maliki 
said "Hamas fundamentalism is the main factor justifying such 
heinous crimes," while former Hamas PM Ismayil Haniyah and 
other Hamas officials publicly condemned the killing and said 
the case is being aggressively investigated.  Al-Qidwa 
rejected Hamas' condemnation of the murder as "lip service" 
and said he doubts Hamas will seriously investigate.  End 
summary. 
 
Christian Murdered in Gaza City 
------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On October 8, the body of Rami Ayyad was found in 
Gaza City.  According to media reports and security contacts, 
Ayyad was shot in the head twice and stabbed several times. 
Ihab al-Ghussian, spokesman for the former Interior Ministry, 
told the press that 30-year-old Ayyad was secretary of the 
Baptist-affiliated Holy Bible Association, and that the case 
is under investigation.  According to Ghussian, Ayyad had 
been missing for a day and had previously received death 
threats from unknown persons.  A relative of Ayyad told 
Palestinian press October 8 that Ayyad was being pressured to 
convert to Islam and that the Holy Bible Association offices 
were attacked with an explosive device several months ago. 
 
Hamas Condemns Killing, But PA 
Blames Hamas for Sheltering Extremism 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) All Palestinian factions, including Hamas, publicly 
condemned the murder and called for swift action to apprehend 
the killers; however, PA and Fatah officials blamed Hamas for 
sheltering violent Islamist extremism in Gaza.  PA Minister 
of Information Riyad Maliki told Palestinian press October 9 
that "Hamas fundamentalism is the main factor justifying such 
heinous crimes."  Former Hamas PM Haniyah told local press 
October 8 that he condemns the killing and will not tolerate 
antagonism of Christian)Muslim relations. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Gaza Governor Muhammad al-Qidwa told PolSpec by 
telephone October 9 that all initial indications point to a 
hate crime.  Al-Qidwa said Ayyad had no family or personal 
feuds and was not robbed.  He said Ayyad was likely murdered 
because of his religion.  He said Ayyad had received three 
death threats before he was kidnapped October 7 and Ayyad,s 
family received an October 8 phone call saying he had been 
executed.  Al-Qidwa added that the "Army of Islam," which 
took responsibility for BBC reporter Alan Johnston's 2006 
kidnapping in Gaza, is also blamed for attacking Ayyad's 
Christian bookstore several months ago.  After the attack, 
the "Army of Islam" claimed Ayyad was a missionary urging 
Muslims to convert to Christianity. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Al-Qidwa rejected Hamas' condemnation of the murder 
as "lip service" and said he is unaware of any serious 
investigation or arrests made in aftermath of this crime.  He 
said PA President Mahmud Abbas (Abu Mazen) is personally 
disturbed by the crime and has tasked an immediate report on 
the incident.
