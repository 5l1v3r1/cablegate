¶1.  This is an action message, please see paragraph 2. 
 
¶2.  Department appreciates Embassy's effort to obtain GOJ 
advance concurrence to bring protected migrants from 
Guantanamo to Jamaica for medical treatment, as necessary. 
In response to the suggestion of MFAFT Director of Bilateral 
Relations to a written exchange of notes or or letters, 
Embassy is requested to propose the following language for an 
exchange of notes.  If the GOJ concurs with this language, 
Embassy may proceed to exchange notes. 
 
Draft Exchange of Notes 
 
Complimentary opening: 
 
The United States Government provides protection on the U.S. 
Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, to certain migrants who have 
been found to be in need of international protection, pending 
resettlement in a third country.  From time to time during 
their stay, migrants may require medical services beyond the 
capacity of the facilities on Guantanamo Bay.  The Embassy 
proposes to transport such migrants, with escort, to Jamaica 
to access needed medical services.  After receiving 
treatment, such migrants would return to the Naval Station. 
The U.S. Government would pay the costs of transportation to 
and from Jamaica, as well as the reasonable costs of 
necessary medical services, subsistence, and other needs for 
such migrants and their escorts while in Jamaica.  The 
Embassy requests that the Government of Jamaica facilitate 
the entry, stay, and departure of such migrants and escorts 
for the period of time necessary to obtain required medical 
services. 
 
The International Organization for Migration, or another 
international or non-governmental organization designated by 
the U.S. Government, may act on behalf of the U.S. Government 
to implement this proposal. 
 
The Embassy further proposes that this note, and the 
Ministry,s affirmative note in reply, constitute acceptance 
of this proposal.
