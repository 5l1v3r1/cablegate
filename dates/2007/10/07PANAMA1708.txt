(C) Panama did not want to "jeopardize" its role as an 
interlocutor with Cuba and bridge between Cuba and its 
hemispheric neighbors, Panamanian First VP and FM Samuel 
Lewis explained on October 26 during breakfast with 
Ambassador when reftel demarche was presented.  Lewis 
demurred on whether Panama would vote against or at a minimum 
abstain on Cuba's annual UNGA resolution condemning the U.S. 
economic embargo against Cuba.  Post has also delivered 
reftel demarche to MFA DG for International Political Affairs 
Javier Bonagas, but received no substantive response.  Lewis, 
who planned to travel to Havana November 3-4 to participate 
in a trade show, was very proud of President Torrijos' 
achievements in establishing amicable relations with all its 
hemispheric neighbors, including Cuba.  Lewis said that 
Panama would continue to play a useful role brokering 
relations across the political spectrum of the Western 
Hemisphere.  Comment:  It is highly unlikely that the U.S. 
will be able to garner Panama's support to oppose this 
resolution, but rather Panama will continue to vote for this 
resolution.
