SUBJECT: NAS BRASILIA REPORT FOR SEPTEMBER 2007 
 
Sensitive but unclassified -- please protect accordingly. 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: NAS-supported activities during September -- 
though still limited in size and scope -- continued to produce 
results.  In particular, two key NAS and DEA-supported operations 
carried out by the Brazilian Federal Police (DPF) resulted in 
several arrests and the seizure of significant amounts of illicit 
drugs, weapons, vehicles, and other contraband.  More importantly, 
these operations contributed to disrupting a plan to establish a 
country-wide drug distribution center and to preventing explosives 
and weapons from reaching the Primeiro Commando da Capital (PCC) -- 
one of Brazil's most powerful organized criminal gangs.  Despite 
several high-level changes in personnel at the DPF stemming from the 
arrival of the new Director General, Luiz Fernando Correa, NAS has 
continued to enjoy a very good relationship with the DPF, and signed 
the INL Implementing Arrangement, which will improve the 
transparency and efficiency of our financial cooperation.  Finally, 
on the demand reduction front, the GOB has begun to explore 
expanding the Brazilian version of the DARE program to reach a wider 
segment of youth.  END SUMMARY. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
POLICE OPERATIONS DISRUPT CRIMINAL PLANS 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) NAS Brasilia's continued support for DEA-vetted Sensitive 
Investigative Units (SIUs) has facilitated Brazilian Federal Police 
(DPF) investigations and operations.  In particular, the DPF 
concluded two successful operations in September, which resulted in 
the capture of high-level drug traffickers and the seizure of 
illicit contraband that was ultimately destined for use in other, 
more nefarious, criminal activity: 
 
¶A.  On September 21, Federal Police in the Brazilian state of Goias, 
acting on SIU-developed intelligence, seized approximately 1.3 tons 
of marijuana that was hidden in two tractor trailers normally used 
for transporting livestock.  The marijuana was of Paraguayan origin 
and was destined for a farm in the Brazilian city of Marrinhos in 
the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, where an international drug 
trafficking organization with operations in Brazil, Suriname, 
Guyana, and Colombia planned to establish a Brazil-wide marijuana 
distribution center.  The DPF seized the two trucks, two other 
vehicles, and a .22 caliber rifle, and arrested five people, which 
included the leader of the group.  These individuals are facing 
prison terms of up to 15 years for violation of international drug 
trafficking laws. 
 
¶B.  The same day, the DPF also effectively utilized SIU intelligence 
in a task force operation, involving DPF and Brazilian Military 
Police Officers, which resulted in two arrests and the seizure of 
three vehicles, two motorcycles, an arsenal of explosives, firearms, 
and approximately 432 kilograms of cocaine base in the city of 
Ribeirao Preto, in the state of Sao Paulo.  Brazilian Civil Police 
at the Presidente Venceslau (P2) Prison, which houses 760 members of 
the Primeiro Commando da Capital (PCC) gang, provided intelligence 
on the gang's ongoing and planned operations.  Federal Police 
learned that the PCC had arranged for Bolivian cocaine base and 
Paraguayan furnished weapons and explosives to be smuggled into 
Brazil via aircraft to the city of Ribeirao Preto.  Moreover, the 
seized arms and explosives were to be used by the PCC in a series of 
attacks on armored car operators and eventually target aircraft in 
Sao Paulo.  It remains unclear whether the PCC merely ordered the 
purchase of the drugs or whether the PCC's influence and operational 
capability have extended to Paraguay and Bolivia.  What is clear to 
the DPF from this investigation is that trafficking drugs and 
munitions is increasingly becoming a part of the PCC's modus 
operandi. 
 
-------------------------------- 
NAS-DPF IMPLEMENTING ARRANGEMENT 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) On September 19, NAS and the DPF signed an Implementing 
Arrangement (IA) for the administration of narcotics control and law 
 
BRASILIA 00001893  002 OF 002 
 
 
enforcement funds.  (Note: The signed original has been sent to 
INL/LP.  End note.) The IA defines procedures for governing an 
operational expense account and establishes a more transparent and 
efficient system for providing and accounting for INL funds.  Luiz 
Fernando Correa, the new Director General, and Delegado Roberto 
Troncon, the new Director of the DPF's Organized Crime Division, 
both expressed their appreciation for NAS cooperation, and conveyed 
their desire to maintain "our excellent partnership."  (Bio note: 
Correa was previously the head of National Public Safety 
Secretariat, SENASP, and Troncon headed the DPF's Financial Crimes 
 
SIPDIS 
Section in Sao Paulo.  End bio note.) 
 
---------------------------------- 
DEMAND REDUCTION -- DARE TO EXPAND 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (U) The Brazilian National Anti-drug Secretariat (SENAD) and the 
National Public Safety Secretariat (SENASP) have begun to re-examine 
the U.S.-based Drug Abuse Resistance Education Program (DARE) or as 
it is known in Brazil, PROERD.  Paulo Roberto Uchoa, the National 
Anti-drug Secretary (the Brazilian Drug Czar), told NAS Director on 
September 27 that although Brazil successfully implemented the DARE 
program in all of Brazil's 26 states and the Federal District, the 
GOB would like to expand the program in order to reach a broader and 
older audience, especially adolescents most prone to fall victim to 
drug abuse and violence.  NAS will continue to follow these efforts 
and report via septel.
