BAGHDAD 00003383 001.2 OF 002 


Classified By: Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 

Summary 
------- 

¶1. (S) UK Ambassador Prentice told Ambassador Crocker October 
8 that the UK would stop boycotting Basrah Governor Wa,eli 
following the decision of the local administrative court that 
Wa,eli could not be removed from office by the Provincial 
Council. Prentice had informed PM Maliki, who was reportedly 
not pleased. Prentice previewed the comments PM Gordon Brown 
would make to Parliament later that day regarding British 
forces in southeastern Iraq -- 4,500 troops till the end of 
March 2008, a subsequent reduction to 2,500, subject to 
conditions on the ground. He also outlined the terms and 
conditions for the immigration of Iraqi locally engaged staff 
that PM Brown would mention. The two Ambassadors also 
touched on Iran as well as British plans to support economic 
development in Basrah. End Summary. 

We will have contact with Wa,eli 
-------------------------------- 

¶2. (S) UK Ambassador Christopher Prentice called on 
Ambassador Crocker to preview the presentation to Parliament 
regarding British forces in Iraq that British PM Gordon Brown 
was scheduled to deliver today, October 8. During the course 
of the conversation, he revealed that HMG was ending its 
boycott of contact with Basrah Governor Wa,eli. He noted 
that as the judicial process had confirmed Wa,eli in office, 
it made no sense to treat him as illegitimate. He had 
informed PM Maliki of the decision; Maliki was not pleased 
but indicated he could live with the British decision and 
even with Wa,eli,s continuation as Governor as long as 
security remained out of Wa,eli,s hands. 

¶3. (S) Welcoming the UK decision, Ambassador Crocker observed 
that security would remain under the operations center so 
Wa,eli would not control it. He observed that moving 
forward with Wa,eli was the practical thing to do, noting 
that Vice President Adil Abdel Mehdi had said it was time to 
move on. In response to Ambassador Crocker,s question about 
next steps by the Provincial Council, Prentice replied that 
the British Consul General in Basrah had indicated the 
parties were seeking to arrange deals on who would acquire 
subordinate positions under Wa,eli -- they appear resigned 
to his continuous in office. 

Brown,s Speech and the numbers 
------------------------------ 

¶4. (S) At the time of the meeting, the text of Gordon 
Brown,s statement was not yet final -- Prentice promised to 
share it with Ambassador Crocker and General Petraeus as soon 
as possible. The UK military presence in southern Iraq would 
be 4,500 troops through the end of March 2008. There will be 
an additional 500 in the region -- PM Brown will not be 
specific, but these 500 will be in Kuwait. Subsequently, the 
UK presence will reduce over time to about 2,500 in southern 
Iraq, subject to conditions. The rationale for this 
reduction is that the focus for UK troops in MND-SE is 
training and mentoring of Iraqi forces. 

¶5. (S) Responding to Ambassador Crocker,s questions, 
Prentice said that the 4,500 UK troops for southern Iraq 
excluded staff or special operations troops in Baghdad or 
other parts of Iraq. He noted that the draft text alluded to 
the possibility of a further reduction of 500 in the 
pre-March 2008 period, but that he and the UK military 
foresee 4,500 British troops in MND-SE through March 2008. 
They will be based at the Basrah Air Station -- discussion on 
that issue was now closed. 

¶6. (S) Prentice reported that he had informed PM Maliki, who 
referred to the drawdown as a timetable. Prentice corrected 
him, reminding him that the size of the UK presence was 
subject to conditions on the ground. Maliki acknowledged 
that the reduction in UK troops was a natural process and did 
not express anxiety about it. 

Immigration Terms and Conditions 
--------------------------------

¶7. (C) Prentice also previewed PM Brown,s statement 
regarding terms and conditions for Iraqis who had worked for 
the British to gain admission to the UK or be compensated. 
He made clear that this package was only for those who would 
be made redundant by the UK drawdown or had been threatened. 
The details were still to be worked out. Brown would make 
clear that this not a precedent for a long-service 
immigration benefit but a limited benefit for Iraqi locally 
engaged staff (LES). Prentice closed on this topic by noting 
that Maliki was concerned that if Brown mentioned this 
special immigration program publicly, it would undermine 
confidence in the Iraqi government. Prentice said he told 
Maliki it had to be in the public statement to Parliament as 
British media had attacked HMG for its failure to provide for 
its Iraqi LES. 

Basrah Development Forum 
------------------------ 

¶8. (S) Prentice wrapped up comments on Brown,s statement 
with a discussion of economic development initiatives, which 
he said enjoyed the strong support of PM Brown. As well as 
announcing significant funding for an investment fund, Brown 
pushed hard for the creation of an investment council to 
coordinate the different strands of economic development in 
Basrah. He added that a highly prominent British businessman 
would be a key member of the council -- PM Brown is 
determined that this investment council will succeed. Later, 
Prentice asked for a briefing on the success of the Erbil 
fund. Noting that a review was due later this month, 
Ambassador Crocker promised to share lessons learned with 
Prentice and to mention the investment council plans to 
Deputy Prime Minister Barhan later that evening. 

British Hostages 
---------------- 

¶9. (S) Prentice indicated the UK had received credible 
proof-of-life of the five UK hostages. Ambassador Crocker 
expressed pleasure with the news, calling it a very hopeful 
sign and noting that proof-of-life usually indicates the 
hostage takers, willingness to ultimately negotiate the 
release of their hostages. 

Comment 
------- 

¶10. (S) The UK decision to stop boycotting Wa,eli is 
welcome. Though corrupt, Wa,eli is not an ideologue and can 
serve to advance the movement towards Iraqis running their 
own affairs in Basrah. PM Brown,s commitment to investment 
and economic development in Basrah is also welcome and 
likewise bodes well for moving Iraq forward.
