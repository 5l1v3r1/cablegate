¶1.  (U) On October 25, poloff delivered reftel A demarche to 
Mario Barquero, the new Director of International 
Organizations at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, soliciting 
Nicaragua's support for David Walker's candidacy for the 
IAAC.  Barquero offered no comment on Walker's candidacy, but 
took a copy of the summary points and agreed to consider U.S. 
views on the matter.  Barquero also asked which other 
countries were running candidates for the same position. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Barquero used the opportunity to solicit U.S. 
support for Miguel D'Escoto Brockmann (reftel B), Nicaragua's 
choice for the GRULAC candidate for the presidency of the 
63rd Session of the UNGA.  Barquero claimed that the 
Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) declared its support for 
D'Escoto's candidacy in a meeting two months ago.  He further 
stated no other Latin American country has put forth a 
nominee, indicating, in his words, "tacit support" for 
D'Escoto.
