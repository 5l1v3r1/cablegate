REF: STATE 129919 
 
(U) On September 18, Poloff delivered reftel points to 
Tiina Krevald, MFA Acting Director for International 
Cooperation, and Veikko Kala, MFA UN Desk Officer, to 
encourage the Government of Estonia (GOE) to contribute 
financially to the UN Special Tribunal for Lebanon.  On 
October 2, Kala informed us that it is unlikely the MFA 
will contribute to the Lebanon Tribunal.  The GOE has 
not completed its budget yet and cannot make financial 
commitments until this process is completed.  Also, Kala 
noted, Estonia previously contributed to three other 
international tribunals (for the former Yugoslavia, 
Rwanda, and Sierra Leone).
