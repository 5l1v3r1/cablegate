SUBJECT: CUBA EMBARGO RESOLUTION - NO CHANGE EXPECTED IN 
CZECH VOTE 
 
REF: STATE 148506 
 
Talking points were provided to the Czech MFA's Director of 
the UN Department, Jan Michal.  While the Czech Republic is a 
noted supporter of human rights and democratic transition in 
Cuba, and stands with the U.S. on almost all aspects of our 
Cuba policy, this is one area of difference between us.  The 
Czechs can be expected to vote in support of this UNGA 
resolution, as they have for the last 15 years.
