SUBJECT: PETRONAS IN TURKMENISTAN:  FULL OF GAS 
 
¶1.  (U) Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for public Internet. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Petronas, which unexpectedly hit 
substantial (an estimated 20 billion cubic meters at maximum 
production) reserves of ethane- and propane-rich natural gas 
in the Caspian Sea, is looking at gas export options.  These 
options include sending the gas north to Russia via a 
pipeline for which it would need to pay a substantial sum to 
help rehabilitate (which it is planning on pursuing), 
exporting natural gas to Iran, or -- now -- sending it west 
via a connector pipeline proposed by the U.S. and Azeri 
governments.  Although Petronas mistrusts the Azeris and 
Turks as potential business partners, the connector pipeline 
could be the most economically attractive option, and 
Petronas would be willing to cooperate with a U.S. Trade and 
Development Agency-funded feasibility study.  However, the 
need to factor ethane and propane extraction into the overall 
equation could create new complications.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) During a September 17 dinner, the General Manager 
of Petronas in Turkmenistan, Suleiman Abdullah, told U.S. 
Trade and Development Agency Regional Director for Europe and 
Eurasia Dan Stein that his company, which works 
Turkmenistan's Block 1 in the Caspian, has found significant 
amounts of gas along with the oil that Petronas currently is 
working.  Although Petronas currently continues to burn off 
the gas, it expects to produce up to 20 billion cubic meters 
(bcms) per year of gas over the coming years.  Petronas is 
planning to build four drilling rigs and operate a collector 
platform in Block 1.  Abdullah told Stein Petronas is 
entitled to obtain the highest available price for its gas 
under its production sharing agreement. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) In general, Petronas favors sending the gas north 
to Russia, since Petronas knows that it can count on 
receiving its share of the gas proceeds, even though the $100 
per thousand cubic meters (tcms) Turkmenistan receives from 
Gazprom is far below the price the Europeans pay.  To that 
end, Abdullah said, his company is planning on rehabilitating 
the Turkmenistan portion of the Caspian littoral (CAC-III) 
pipeline, as foreseen in the May 12 
Putin-Nazarbayev-Berdimuhamedov agreement in Turkmenbashy. 
According to Abdullah, the entire Turkmenistan portion of the 
pipeline would need to be replaced, and Petronas is 
considering replacing the 42-inch pipe with 48-inch piping. 
Petronas has also worked out a deal with Kazakhstan's 
Kaztransgaz, owned by Kazmunaygaz, in which Kaztransgaz would 
pay for the replacement of about 500 kilometers of bad Kazakh 
pipeline and a compressor station located in Kazakhstan (the 
compressor station has been non-functioning since it was 
cannibalized some years ago), if Petronas guarantees payment 
of transport fees for the next 20 years. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Petronas is also looking at -- and, in fact, has 
already broken ground for -- a gas treatment plant to remove 
propane and butane from the gas and bring the gas up to 
commercial pipeline standards.  It expects to open the plant 
north of the Caspian port city of Turkmenbashy in 2010.  More 
speculative plans for the facility would include not only the 
gas treatment plant, but also a tank farm and -- potentially 
-- a petrochemical plant to produce up to 450,000 tons of 
ethylene per year.  When Phase I of the plant is complete, 
Abdullah said, Petronas expects to be able to process five 
bcm of gas per year.  With the completion of Phase II, 
processing would increase to 10 bcm per year.  Abdullah 
reported that Petronas is considering selling the processed 
gas to Iran, possibly as part of a swap arrangement. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Petronas is moving forward on both these 
possibilities, but Abdullah also said, "We will ship our gas
