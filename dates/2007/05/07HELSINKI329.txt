REF: SECSTATE 56397 
 
¶1. (SBU) Econoff delivered reftel demarche on the 
International Whaling Commission (IWC) to Mr. Esko Jaakkola, 
Finland,s IWC representative in the Ministry of the 
Environment.  Jaakkola said Finland will continue to support 
the consensus and position of like-minded nations during the 
IWC meeting.  Specifically, Jaakkola expressed support for 
the U.S. position on the bowhead whale quota and the need for 
the Conservation Committee to limit the scope of its 
activities to areas outlined in its mandate, rather than 
further dilute its limited resources. 
 
¶2. (SBU) While Jaakkola said U.S. intentions to move the 
Revised Management Scheme (RMS) forward were positive, he was 
pessimistic that real progress could be made due to the 
strong opposing viewpoints.  Nevertheless, Finland intends to 
support reasonable measures to further the work of the RMS. 
Jaakkola said the U.S. was the only nation strong enough to 
offer the necessary leadership to break the current impasse. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Finland resolved its financial obligation to the IWC 
on April 4, making it a member in good standing with full 
voting rights. 
 
¶4. (SBU) According to Jaakkola, last October the EU sent a 
letter to member states claiming it should have the 
&community exclusive competence8 for whaling matters and 
that the common EU position should be voiced by the EU 
Presidency country.  EU member states disagreed with the 
Commission,s position; however, the member states did agree 
to coordinate closely on future IWC issues.  For its part, 
Finland is nervous that a common EU position may water down 
the strength of the like-minded nations and it risks further 
alienating other like-minded nations such as those in Latin 
America.  In additional to ad hoc coordination meetings, the 
EU will coordinate further its position during EU meetings 
one hour prior to the start of the general IWC sessions. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Jaakkola is hopeful that Japan will soften its 
position during the upcoming IWC meeting on issues such as 
scientific whaling, potentially leading to real progress on 
RMS issues.  Jaakkola understands that Nicaragua, Guatemala, 
Costa Rica and Belize might be modifying their position to 
closer align with the like-minded nations.  In addition, new 
IWC countries such as Slovenia, Croatia and Cyprus will 
likely support the like-minded nations which should lead to a 
simple majority.
