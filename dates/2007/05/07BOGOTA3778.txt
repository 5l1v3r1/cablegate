SUBJECT: PRESIDENT URIBE TO RELEASE FARC PRISONERS, SEEKS 
TRUTH-FOR-FREEDOM LAW TO ADDRESS PARA-POLITICAL SCANDAL 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor John S. Creamer 
Reason: 1.4 (b,d) 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  (C) President Alvaro Uribe announced two significant 
proposals designed to further peace processes in Colombia. 
On May 25, he said he would release FARC prisoners before 
June 7 for "reasons of State."  On May 22, Uribe outlined a 
truth-for-freedom proposal that would allow those accused of 
criminal ties to former paramilitaries to plead guilty and 
confess in return for a guarantee of no jail time. 
Presidential Communications Director Jorge Mario Eastman told 
polcouns the GOC considers it impossible to jail all those 
who may be implicated in former paramilitary activities.  The 
new provisions would apparently not affect the Justice and 
Peace Law (JPL) or the ex-paramilitary leaders now jailed in 
Itagui; they will continue their confessions, be subject to 
JPL sentences, and face extradition for JPL violations.  End 
summary.

"Release" of FARC Prisoners 
--------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) President Uribe announced May 25 that by June 7 FARC 
prisoners will be "conditionally released" from jail for 
"reasons of State."  Previously, Uribe had said he would 
release a "massive" number of FARC prisoners, who would be 
placed in less restrictive facilities under Catholic Church 
supervision on the condition they did not return to crime. 
Uribe did not specify how many prisoners would benefit from 
the plan, where they would be located, or whether any FARC 
prisoners would be excluded.  He said he would use existing 
authority under the Public Order Law to declare the prisoners 
participants in the peace process, similar to the status ELN 
negotiators enjoy in Havana.  The designation would not be an 
amnesty, and the prisoners could be returned to jail at the 
president's discretion.  Uribe said he is also examining 
whether JPL provisions may be applied to FARC prisoners 
convicted of crimes against humanity, which would effectively 
limit their sentences to 5-8 years.

Uribe Proposes Truth-for-Freedom Law 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶3.  (C) On May 22, Uribe proposed a "national discussion" on 
whether politicians, ranchers, businessmen, and others who 
cooperated with the paramilitaries but were not involved in 
murder or other violent crimes should receive no jail time in 
exchange for full confessions of their past ties to armed 
groups.  He said discovering the truth about those ties was 
one of Colombia's highest priorities.  Presidential 
Communications Director Jorge Mario Eastman told polcouns May 
25 the GOC regards it as impossible to jail everyone in 
Colombia who had links with the former paramilitaries.  He 
said Uribe's proposal would require legislation, as well as 
the support of opposition parties, to succeed. 
 
--------------------------- 
No Changes for Jailed Paras 
--------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (U) Uribe said that JPL process will continue.  Jailed 
ex-paras will remain in jail, continue their confessions, and 
be subject to extradition if found in violation of JPL terms. 
 Former paramilitary leaders who had abandoned the peace 
process, such as Ever Veloza (HH) or Vicente Castano, would 
be subject to extradition once they were captured.  Uribe 
said he would consider moving the jailed ex-paras to 
"agricultural colonies" once they had completed their 
confessions and been sentenced.

Congress:  Mixed Views on Proposed Legislation 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶5.  (U) Congressional reaction to Uribe's proposals is split, 
with some fearing any bill providing benefits to congressmen 
jailed in the para-political scandal would further damage the 
 
institution's legitimacy.  In March, Polo Democratic Party 
Senator Gustavo Petro proposed a "Ley de Punto Final" (truth 
pact) similar to Uribe's concept, but he immediately labeled 
Uribe's proposal a trick to free jailed political allies. 
The Liberal Party publicly rejected Uribe's no jail proposal, 
but senior Party officials told us privately a law may be in 
order.  Contacts from all parties agreed political solutions 
will be required to address large numbers of national and 
local politicians, businessmen, farmers and others who may be 
implicated in past associations with the various armed groups 
that previously controlled the Colombian countryside.
