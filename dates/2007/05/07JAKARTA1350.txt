SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERED:  PROPOSED ARMS TRADE TREATY 
(ATT) 
 
REF: STATE 63299 
 
¶1. We conveyed U.S. position reftel on the ATT to Andy 
Rachmianto, Deputy Director for Conventional Weapons Issues 
in the Department of Foreign Affairs, on May 14.  We 
underscored the pragmatic rationale for the U.S. position and 
the reality that enforcement of effective trade controls 
ultimately rested with national governments. 
 
¶2. Rachmianto noted that he had been extensively involved in 
the process so far and that Indonesia was in favor of such a 
treaty, provided it did not infringe Indonesia's interests. 
Indonesia had some domestic arms production but was by and 
large a net arms importer and therefore wanted to ensure 
international arms trade was uniformly regulated. 
 
¶3. In further discussion, Rachmianto acknowledged that 
success of any such treaty would depend heavily on 
enforcement at the national level.  We also noted Indonesia's 
position against the use of sanctions as a rule and asked 
what effective compliance mechanisms Indonesia might be able 
to support in an ATT. 
 
¶4. Rachmianto concurred that the mandate of the Group of 
Governmental Experts (GGE) should be only to explore 
feasibility, scope and parameters, not to negotiate a treaty.
