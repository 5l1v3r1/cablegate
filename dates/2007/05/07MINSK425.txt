Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) During President Ahmadinejad's May 21-22 visit to 
Minsk, Belarus and Iran signed a wide range of economic 
agreements.  The deal with the most potential significance 
grants Belarus access to the Jofeir oilfield.  Any arms sales 
were not made public.  Only significant military exports from 
Belarus to Iran would expand trade to the high level -- USD 
500 million annually -- proposed by Lukashenko.  End summary. 
 
Economic Deals: Show Me the Money 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) An agreement for Belarus' national oil company to 
drill in the Jofeir oilfield represents the one potentially 
significant economic deliverable made public during President 
Ahmadinejad's May 21-22 visit to Minsk.  However, although 
Lukashenko said oil production could begin "today," no terms 
were given.  Other economic agreements included expansion of 
Iranian automobile production in Belarus (reftel), increasing 
agricultural imports from Iran, reciprocal recognition of 
safety and standards certification, bilateral export 
guarantees, and a joint program to train banking sector 
personnel.  The Iranian Ambassador claimed an agreement on 
energy cooperation would be signed in the coming months. 
Lukashenko said trade between the two countries should expand 
to USD 500 million this year (from USD 36 million in 2006). 
 
Military Trade: Not Exposed to Light of Day 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) No negotiations to purchase military or dual use 
equipment were made public.  At the May 22 opening of Milex, 
the premium military sales exposition in Belarus, an 
announcer said an Iranian minister was in attendance.  In an 
arrangement that could provide training for those in Iran's 
military industrial complex, an accord between the Belarusian 
Ministry of Education and the Iranian Ministry of Science, 
Research and Technology would reportedly expand several times 
over the number of Iranian students in Belarus from the 
present day figure of 288.  Most of the students are 
reportedly studying mechanical engineering. 
 
State Television Glosses Over Iran's Isolation 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶4. (SBU) State news media gave extensive coverage of the 
visit.  Ahmadinejad was portrayed as a man of peace, 
particularly when he was shown commemorating victims of World 
War II.  Belarusian Television claimed that Iran "despite UN 
sanctions" engaged in substantial trade with the West, even 
suggesting the United States was Iran's 12th leading trade 
partner. 
 
Comment: Belarus Has to Take What It Can Get 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Lukashenko said at the press conference summarizing 
the results of the visit that Belarus seeks to diversify 
exports.  Given Belarus' poor relations with its neighbors 
and products of questionable quality, Iran and other 
countries with problematic relations with the West will 
continue to remain prime targets of opportunity for the 
Lukashenko regime.  The suggestion that trade will reach USD 
500 million annually is the same statement Lukashenko trots 
out during high-level meetings with any foreign country. 
Although the export of dual-use technologies to Iran will 
likely increase, we will believe trade between Tehran and 
Minsk will hit half a billion dollars when we see it.
