SUBJECT: NO SURPRISES IN HISTADRUT ELECTIONS AS EINI 
ELECTED CHAIRMAN 
 
¶1. (U) Histadrut Chairman Ofer Eini was elected by a large 
majority on May 15, giving him four years as head of the 
labor federation.  Eini was appointed to succeed Amir Peretez 
as Histadruit leader when Peretz was named Defense Minister 
in January 2006.  Talia Livni was also reelected as head of 
Na'amat, the Histadrut women's organization.  Histadrut is 
expected to publish final voting results in a day or two. 
Media reports quoted Eini saying that his immediate goal will 
be negotiating a new public-sector agreement that includes a 
pay raise. 
 
¶2. (U) Eini easily defeated Leon Ben-Lulu, head of a faction 
representing some Likud members.  The vote proceeded after 
Jerusalem District Court rejected a Ben-Lulu / Likud petition 
to delay the election on the grounds that ballot boxes in 
workplaces would lead to pressure on workers by committees 
close to Eini.  The ballot boxes were placed in workplaces 
this year in an effort to increase voter participation. 
Voter turnout was only around 25% -- less than it was in the 
last Histadrut election. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Eini was publicly supported by most factions within 
the Histadrut, leading to criticism that the elections were 
unnecessary and a waste of 50 million shekels at a time when 
the Histadrut is facing huge deficits.  One Histadrut contact 
said that Ben-Lulu would have been offered a top position if 
he had supported Eini, but that this opportunity disappeared 
when Ben-Lulu forced an election.
