SUBJECT: DOD-STATE 1206 CONFERENCE SUMMARY 
 
REF: STATE 62729 
 
¶1. Post has reviewed draft guidance and template and believes 
they provide a constructive framework for Defense-State 
coordination at post. 
 
¶2. Our sole comment pertains to II.d. of the template.  We 
were somewhat surprised by the reference to "the normal 
budget process" and presume this simply means that funding 
under Section 1206 is drawdown funding and therefore not part 
of the traditional process of negotiating specific amounts 
for individual components of the assistance budget.  If this 
is in fact the case, we see no problem with that language.
