REF: SHANGHAI 61 
 
¶1.  (U) With great pageantry, Tianning Temple opened its newly 
refurbished pagoda in Changzhou, Jiangsu Province, at the 
auspicious time of 9:08 AM on April 30.  The pagoda is reported 
to be the tallest pagoda in the world and stands at 153.79 
meters (505 feet).  According to press reports, the temple was 
built over 1,000 years ago during the Tang Dynasty and has been 
rebuilt at least five times.  Press reports vary as to how much 
was spent on the refurbishment with BBC and Xinhua reporting 
that the temple spent RMB 300 million (USD 39 million) and South 
China Morning Post (SCMP) reporting that refurbishments cost RMB 
100 million (USD 13 million).  The source of funding was through 
the temple and "its believers"; according to Changzhou Foreign 
Affairs Office (FAO) Director Shen Yilin, no government funds 
were used. 
 
¶2.  (U) There was a strong Changzhou Government presence at the 
temple opening with Changzhou Mayor Wang Weicheng attending and 
delivering remarks.  After reaffirming the importance of Jiang 
Zemin's "Three Represents" theory and President Hu Jintao's 
"Harmonious Society" concept, Mayor Wang said that China's 
reform and opening had led to an increase in living standards 
and faster economic development.  He added that if the economy 
developed well, religion would also develop well. 
 
¶3.  (U) SCMP reported that more than 8,000 people attended the 
ceremony in Changzhou, a city of about 4 million located along 
the Yangtze River northwest of Shanghai in southern Jiangsu 
Province (ref).  On the margins of the ceremony, Changzhou FAO 
Director Shen told Poloff that 108 high-level Buddhists from 
throughout Mainland China, as well as Taiwan, Macau, Hong Kong 
and Los Angeles also attended the ceremony.  Reporters from 
mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, and Singapore covered 
the event. 
 
¶4.  (U) The elaborate ceremony featured nine dragon-dance 
troupes, traditional Buddhist horns and other musical 
instruments, chanting, and speeches from government officials 
and distinguished Buddhist masters.  At the conclusion of the 
speeches, thousands of balloons and a flock of doves were 
released. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Comment: While many press reports said the temple 
opening was evidence of a religious revival in China, we believe 
it reflects both increased "space" for officially-sanctioned 
religious groups and increased prosperity in East China.  It may 
also reflect political savvy by Changzhou authorities who are 
now highlighting the temple as a tourist attraction.  We would 
also hazard a guess that some of the "believers" funding the 
pagoda were members of the overseas Buddhist community.  Since 
the introduction of the high-speed trains between Nanjing and 
Shanghai, Changzhou is now only an hour away from Shanghai, 
making it a potential sightseeing destination for those 
interested in daytrips from Shanghai.  The temple is featured 
prominently in Changzhou's tourist pamphlets.  Many of those 
attending the ceremony received gift bags that included Buddhist 
beads, a book on the temple and a Changzhou tourism guide.
