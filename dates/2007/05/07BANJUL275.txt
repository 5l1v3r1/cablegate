(SBU) Ambassador made reftel demarche to Foreign Affairs 
Permanent Secretary, Bai Ousman Secka, informing him of the 
new U.S. sanctions imposed on Sudan, involving three 
individuals and 31 Sudanese government-owned or controlled 
companies, due to the lack of progress on Darfur. 
Ambassador stressed that we were confident that sanctions 
would bolster, not hinder, the international community's 
efforts to achieve progress in Darfur.  He  added that, if 
the GOS remained intransigent, we would be prepared to take 
more robust action, including increasingly stronger 
sanctions. Secka took note of Ambassador's presentation, but 
made no substantive comment.
