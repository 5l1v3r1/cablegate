AFFAIRS OFFICER RICHARD PROSEN 
 
REF: STATE 055621 
 
¶1.  U.S. Mission NATO welcomes the visit of Mr. Richard L. 
Prosen to conduct consultations with USNATO and NATO 
International Staff in Brussels, May 9-11, 2007. 
 
¶2.  Hotel reservations have been requested at the Crowne 
Plaza Airport Hotel for arrival on May 9, 2007. 
 
¶3.  U.S. Mission POC: 
            David Simons 
            wrk 011-322-724-3221

¶4.  The primary mode of transportation for visitors to 
Brussels is metered taxis, which are plentiful and reliable. 
However, fares, which can be vouchered, are quite expensive. 
The bus, tram and metro system are excellent. 
 
¶5.  NATO visitor,s pass has been requested and will be 
available at NATO HQ,s main entrance gate.  For security 
reasons, all visitors, even those with a green NATO badge, 
must present two pieces of identification or their blue State 
Department-issued badge to the Marine Guard before being 
admitted into the U.S. Mission. 
 
¶6.  Computer and Electronics Usage:  Inter-agency security 
standards prohibit the introduction or use of non-USG owned 
computer hardware and software at all USG diplomatic 
facilities.  Cell phones, palm pilots, radios and other 
convenience electronics are prohibited in all secure areas 
of the Mission.  Travelers who anticipate having special 
needs in terms of either access or computer usage should 
contact the RSO office before arriving at post. 
 
¶7.  Regarding money, there is a branch of the ING Bank at 
NATO which has an ATM that accepts U.S. bank/credit union 
cards on the "PLUS" system.  Numerous downtown banks also 
have ATM machines.  Traveler's checks can be exchanged in 
most banks.  On Tuesday and Thursday mornings, there is a 
cashier at USNATO to which TDY visitors with travel orders 
have access. 
 
¶8.  Threat Assessment:  A worldwide caution regarding the 
threat of transnational terrorism was issued by the 
Department of State.  (Please consult the Department's 
website for text:  HTTP:HTravel.State.Gov.)  In light of 
this caution and the events of September 11, 2001, all 
visitors are encouraged to assess their security posture, 
and be alert to their surroundings.  All visitors should 
exercise caution while traveling abroad as U.S. citizens 
and facilities are often the target of groups demonstrating 
opposition to the U.S. foreign policy. 
 
¶9.  Belgium remains a relatively safe country but as a 
result of the war in Iraq, and sentiments expressed by its 
citizens against the war, American visitors are advised to 
exercise caution and avoid anti-American demonstrations. 
Also, it is prudent not to wear clothes or carry articles 
with logos and emblems associated with the United States at 
this time.  By taking reasonable precautions, visitors 
should enjoy an uneventful stay. However, purse snatching 
and pick-pocketing are occuring more frequently.  In 
Brussels, pick-pocketing and purse snatching are more 
prevalent in the metro system (subway, bus, tram) and at 
Brussels' three major train stations:  Gare du Nord (North 
Station), Gare Central (Central Station), and especially 
Gare du Midi (South Station).  Extra caution should be used 
at the Gare Centrale Station.  Victims have been asked for 
assistance by someone who appeared lost and anxious to 
catch their train.  As the victim responds to the request, 
a third person appears and steals laptop computers, and 
other related travel items.  According to the police, this 
is a new strategy by criminal gangs operating at Central 
Station.  Apparently they prefer platforms 3 and 4, used by 
trains going to the airport and obviously carrying the best 
category of potential victims.  Valuables should never be 
left unattended in vehicles and car doors should always be 
kept locked when driving.  Carry only a minimum amount of 
cash, credit cards and ID.  Expensive jewelry, financial 
records, address books and other personal effects should be 
left at home or stored in a safe place during your visit. 
 
¶10. Emergency numbers for the Police and Medical Assistance 
are 101 and 100 respectively, and for cellular phones 
(locally) 112.  Visitors to Belgium requiring additional 
information should contact the Brussels Regional Security 
Office at 32-2-508-2370 (if dialing locally, 02-508-2370).
