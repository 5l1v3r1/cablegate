SUBJECT: HELMAND: UK REPORT ON WAFA'S JIRGA IN GERESHK 
 
¶1.  This report was drafted by the British POLOFF at PRT 
Lashkah Gar.  It is noteworthy in reporting that no Helmand 
Governor has visited the town of Gereshk in almost 30 years, 
highlighting the scale of the challenge in securing local 
support in Helmand.  Begin text: 
 
¶2.  SUMMARY: Governor Wafa held a Jirga May 10 with local 
leaders in Gereshk, the first visit there by a Helmand 
Governor for 28 years.  Elders were receptive to the GOA 
message but skeptical about a new wave of promises.  PRT will 
have to deliver high and early to win them over. 
 
¶3.  DETAIL: On 10 May, Wafa held a Jirga in Gereshk, 
Helmand's commercial centre and second largest town.  The 
event was attended by Commander TFH and Head of the PRT, who 
led a civilian team comprising the Deputy Head PRT, 
Stabilisation Adviser, Governance Adviser, and Berger LNO. 
 
¶4.  The Jirga took place in a shaded mulberry orchard on the 
eastern side of the town.  The turn out of local leaders was 
not far short of the 500 invited, although no local religious 
leaders attended for fear of Taliban retribution.  Speeches 
were given by Wafa, provincial religious leader Mullawi 
Ahmed, the Mayor, tribal adviser to PTS Ali Shah, chief 
tribal leader Haji Abdul Qadir, and Commander TFH Brigadier 
Lorimer, all interspersed with prayers, poetry readings and 
singing by children.  The occasion concluded with lunch and 
the handing out of turbans.  No comments from the floor were 
invited -- this was disappointing, but probably unsurprising 
given the circumstances of the last 48 hours in Sarwan Qala. 
 
¶5.  Wafa's purpose, as in Sangin on 12 April, was to 
capitalise on the success of a military operation to project 
the GOA's authority in an area where central control has been 
weak for many years.  In his speech, Wafa stressed that 
security would be maintained and would lead to reconstruction 
and development.  He invited Taliban to join the GOA's side, 
but promised tough action against those who did not.  Tribal 
elders should tell the Taliban to leave their areas and 
should work with Afghan and international security forces. 
Development would happen, specifically new schools, 
electricity through the Kajaki Dam, and 92 km of roads.  On 
the civilian deaths in Sarwan Qala, Wafa briefly expressed 
regret and hoped such incidents would not happen again. 
 
¶6.  Mullawi Ahmed spoke at length and with passion to 
disassociate Islam from Taliban jihad.  The Mayor welcomed 
the first Governor's visit for 28 years.  Development would 
create a sense of civic responsibility among local people. 
Haji Qadir expressed scepticism about GOA's ability to 
deliver and urged the construction of a new road along the 
river to Lashkar Gah.  Ali Shah was careful not to criticise 
the Taliban, saying that the issues that made people support 
the Taliban must be addressed so that people would side with 
the GOA instead. 
 
¶7.  Commander TFH expressed regret about Sarwan Qala, while 
emphasising the Taliban's disregard for the well-being of 
civilians.  Development was already underway in Gereshk.  The 
Kajaki Dam project would provide huge opportunities; ISAF 
would only stay in Helmand for as long as was necessary. 
 
PRT COMMENT 
 
¶8.  Fears that the event would be completely overshadowed by 
Sarwan Qala proved unfounded.   Our discussions in the 
margins indicated an understanding among local leaders that 
it is impossible to avoid civilian casualties entirely when 
the Taliban fight from amongst the people.  Several 
interlocutors did not even raise the subject with us. 
 
¶9.  The fact that the last visit by a Governor to Gereshk 
apparently happened nearly three decades ago underlines the 
scale of Wafa's task in securing local support for the GOA. 
 
KABUL 00001678  002 OF 002 
 
 
We would not disagree with local journalists' estimates that 
20 percent of those present were for the GOA, 60 percent were 
sitting on the fence, and 20 percent were against, with many 
skeptical about the GOA's ability to deliver.  Since even 
young, well-educated participants were unsure about 
GoA/international community objectives in Afghanistan, the 
understanding of the uneducated majority must be lower still. 
 
¶10.  This was a fairly festive and colourful event, reflected 
by the Koran reading chosen deliberately to set the context 
of a victory celebration.  But even so, security (provided by 
Afghan and ISAF troops) had to be exceptionally tight and 
many of the participants were nervous.  The sound of a couple 
of Taliban mortar rounds 5-6 miles distant, as if just to 
remind the Jirga that they are not far away, further 
underlined the scale of Wafa's  challenge.  It also 
underlined the scale, and importance, of our challenge to 
push GOA (and ourselves) to deliver on the promises made. 
The HEG/PRT is planning a visit to Gereshk 17th, for a more 
in depth engagement with local leaders to mobilise effort on 
reconstruction and development.  Same civilian participants 
from the PRT.  End text.
