PRESENTATION DELIVERED 
 
REF: A. STATE 57410 (SRI LANKAAFGHANISTAN JOIN GI) 
     ¶B. STATE 62145 (8 NEW GI MEMBERS) 
     ¶C. STATE 58978 (UPCOMING KAZAKHSTAN MTG) 
     ¶D. NOTAL BEIJING 2484 (QUESTIONING EXPANSION) 
 
¶1. (SBU) China welcomed refs A and B information about 
expansion of the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear 
Terrorism (GI) to include ten new members, MFA Arms Control 
Department official Yu Dunhai told poloff May 10.  China 
continues to urge that the process for adding new members be 
refined, as noted ref D, Yu said. 
 
¶2. (SBU) China welcomed ref C inormation about the upcoming 
third GI meeting in Kazakhstan.  Yu said China is researching 
the possibility of making a presentation on Olympic security 
issues as requested by the American and Russian co-chairs and 
is consulting with other agencies about whether it can give 
such a presentation.  Because this question involves experts 
outside the Foreign Ministry, China cannot provide an answer 
by the May 9 deadline and will be in touch as soon as it has 
a formal response, Yu said. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Poloff conveyed further information about the 
FBI-sponsored GI conference in Miami and asked the Chinese to 
provide a delegation list by next week.  Yu said China would 
send a delegation to the conference but may have difficulty 
meeting the suggested registration deadline.
