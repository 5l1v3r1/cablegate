Update on the Measures Taken by the Kingdom of Bahrain to 
Combat Trafficking in Persons 
 
May 2007 
 
This document summarizes the latest measures taken by the 
Government of the Kingdom of Bahrain, through its 
legislative, executive, and judicial authorities, and civil 
society institutions, in combating trafficking in persons. 
 
Preventive Measures 
 
The Ministry of Social Development, in coordination with the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is organizing a symposium on 
"Trafficking in Persons: A Global and a Local Perspective" to 
be held on 29th May, 2007, in Bahrain.  The symposium aims to 
raise awareness on the definition of Trafficking In Persons 
from an international aspect, presented by the International 
Organization for Migration, and to highlight the measures 
taken by the Government of Bahrain and civil society in 
combating human trafficking. 
 
Legislative Measures 
 
The Government of the Kingdom of Bahrain recognizes the 
importance of taking legislative measures in prosecuting 
offenders of human rights, and has thus drafted a law 
criminalizing human trafficking, which was discussed and 
unanimously approved by the Cabinet.  The draft law has 
recently been passed to the Parliament to complete the 
legislative procedures. 
 
Protective Measures 
 
A Government shelter was inaugurated in November 2006 to 
provide protection for women of all nationalities who face 
abuse or become victims of trafficking.  Affiliated with the 
Ministry of Social Development, it provides temporary shelter 
for abused women, providing them welfare, health and mental 
care, as well as providing them with assistance and legal 
counseling. 
 
The Ministry of Justice and Islamic Affairs' Judicial and 
Legal Studies Institute (JLSI), in cooperation with the 
International Organization for Migration (IOM), and the U.S. 
Department of State, delivered a two-week Human Trafficking 
Investigation course to a multi-disciplinary audience of 
criminal justice system professionals in Manama, from January 
7-18, 2007.  The Government is currently evaluating, in 
coordination with the IOM, the extent to which the delivery 
of the Human Trafficking Investigation course has impacted 
and improved the Bahrain criminal justice system's response 
to trafficking in persons in relation to the specific 
investigative best practice guidance contained in the course. 
 
The Government of Bahrain has applied to the International 
Organization for Migration and its observer status will be 
announced at a special session of the IOM Council which will 
be convened on 7th June 2007 in Geneva. 
 
End text of note. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Comment:  The GOB is aware that the USG will soon 
announce its TIP rankings and release the TIP report.  While 
the GOB knows that it is too late to influence the report or 
ranking, it likely sent this summary of measures taken to 
remind us of its commitment to make further progress on TIP 
issues.
