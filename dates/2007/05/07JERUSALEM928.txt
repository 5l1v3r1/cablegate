¶1.  (SBU) The American Director of the American Near East 
Refugee Aid (ANERA) reported to Econoff that ANERA's Gaza 
office was damaged May 17 by an IAF missile strike on a Gaza 
City "Executive Force" headquarters (ref B), which took place 
an estimated 50 meters away.  He said that none of ANERA's 
staff (all Gazans) were injured by the blast, which shattered 
the office's windows.  He expressed his Gaza employees' 
concerns about the unprecedented level of violence and 
confusion, saying that all ANERA construction projects in 
Gaza had been put on hold since May 14.  West Bank/Gaza 
Country Director of CARE International Elizabeth Sime told 
Econoff May 17 that CARE offices in Gaza have been closed 
since May 13, so CARE has not been able to make its routine 
package deliveries of pharmaceuticals and disponsables. 
However, USD 225,000 worth of CARE-supplied basic 
pharmaceuticals were delivered by local vendors to two NGO 
hospitals in Gaza on May 17.

¶2.  (SBU) OCHA reported that UNRWA's largest health clinic in 
Rimal, Gaza City was open May 17, as were those UNRWA health 
care and educational facilities located outside of the Gaza 
City area. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) A USAID Gaza-based staff member who is living close 
to Gaza's Dar al Shifa hospital reported that no clashes had 
taken place in or around the hospital, which is Gaza's 
largest, since the major fighting began May 12. 
 
CROSSINGS' STATUS 
----------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) According to USAID Gaza-based staff, Karni and 
Rafah crossings are closed May 18, but the Nahal Oz fuel 
transfer station is open.
