(U) EconOff delivered reftel negotiation position to Grace Tanno, 
Deputy Director of Division of Market Access (DACESS) at the 
Ministry of External Relations.  Tanno, who includes NTB issues in 
her portfolio, was non-committal.  She said she was familiar with 
the USG position on the issue and informed EconOff that some aspects 
of current Brazilian legislation are "quiet different" from the USG 
position.  Tanno noted that the GOB was still reviewing the proposal 
and existing legislation would have to be modified in coordination 
with existing Mercosul statutes should the USG negotiating points be 
accepted.
