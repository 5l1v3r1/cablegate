Ref: STATE 61378 
 
On May 16, we delivered reftel points to Marin Mottus, 
MFA Near East, Middle East, and Latin America Division 
Director, and Kadri Jogi, MFA Iran Desk Officer, on Iran 
and Venezuela's expanding relationship.  Mottus thanked 
us for the information and said this was new information 
for the MFA.  As Estonia has no diplomatic presence in 
either country, Jogi said that any information the 
United States provides on these two countries is 
appreciated.
