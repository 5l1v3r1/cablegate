SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (U) AgFair 2007, also called the Afghan Agricultural Trade Fair, 
was the first international agricultural trade show of its kind in 
post-war Afghanistan and attracted between 45 and 60 thousand people 
over two days (April 22-23). The fair catalyzed much needed 
investment in the agriculture sector, facilitated trade, and 
introduced new agricultural technologies for sale to Afghanistan. 
The AgFair received sustained positive local press coverage and was 
attended by Mr. David Murdock, CEO and owner of Dole Foods Company, 
and high-level Government of Afghanistan officials.  As the first 
large-scale event of this nature to be held in 30 years, AgFair 
provided a much-needed morale boost to the Afghan public and the 
private sector. END SUMMARY.

AGFAIR EVENT 
------------ 
 
¶2.  (U) AgFair was jointly planned and managed by USAID, the 
Government of Afghanistan's (GOA's) Ministry of Agriculture, 
Irrigation and Livestock (MAIL), and the Afghan International 
Chamber of Commerce (AICC).  Over 200 booths were rented to 
exhibitors and agricultural businesses on the 46,000 square meter 
site which was constructed to international standards in only 72 
days.  The physical structures consisted of 950 square meter chicken 
houses converted into display areas, a central stage area for 
performances, tents erected for food and beverage providers, 
equipment showcase space, and a 314 meter circumference, roofed 
concrete pad for the majority of the agriculture display booths.  On 
a 140-acre plot of land adjacent to the AgFair new technologies 
including laser leveling of land for increased water efficiency; 
drip irrigation; use of plastic mulch techniques for high-value 
horticulture; and improved, appropriate-technology raisin drying 
equipment, were demonstrated.

AGFAIR PARTICIPANT REACTIONS 
---------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (U) International and Afghan firms participated in AgFair. 
Private commercial sponsors included Afghan Wireless Communications 
Company, Kabul Bank, Coca-Cola, Crystal Water, Alokozay Tea, Serena 
Hotel, the Intercontinental Hotel, and Tolo/Lemar.  Businesses 
reported brisk sales to AgFair visitors, as summed up by Mark 
Henning of JDA, a US-based company selling two-wheel tractors for 
Afghan farms.  Henning said, "We sold every piece of equipment we 
brought to AgFair and we made connections for additional work in 
Helmand and Mazar."  Foreign diplomats also attended - the Dutch 
Charge expressed amazement at the scale and scope of the 
enterprise. 
 
¶4.  (U) Afghan farmers also expressed gratitude for the opportunity 
to participate in AgFair.  Simple farming methods and inexpensive 
innovations that increase farm gate prices were demonstrated 
alongside more advanced technologies.  "It is as if a blind man 
enters and gets his sight. AgFair gives us information about new 
agricultural practices", commented Obaidullah, a farmer from 
Qarabagh. Nasruddin, a farmer who lost most of his grapevines during 
the war and is now re-planting them, said, "We have Farmers' 
Festivals in villages but AgFair is nothing like them. It is huge. 
It is well organized. It is educational."  Afghan farming 
associations, in addition to individual farmers, attended the fair. 
Haji Stana Gul, from the Eastern Region Fresh Fruit and Vegetable 
Wholesalers Association, stood proudly in front of his AgFair stand 
and stated, "I am happy to be here because this is how we can 
improve our business."

COMMENT

¶5.  (U) AgFair 2007 had a great impact upon national consciousness 
 
KABUL 00001526  002 OF 002 
 
 
beyond the simple economic impetus it provided to the agriculture 
sector.  An event of this scale and scope had not been attempted in 
Afghanistan for over 30 years, and it was completed without any 
security incidents.  In addition to creating a marketplace for 
agricultural buyers and sellers to transact business, the AgFair 
visually demonstrated, through media coverage, the progress that the 
country has made towards the normal, comparatively prosperous life 
that once existed before the war.  Ordinary Afghan farmers and 
Government of Afghanistan ministries viewed the success of the 
AgFair as proof that the overall situation in the country is 
improving.  AgFair will be expanded to other areas of Afghanistan 
and repeated in the fall.   END COMMENT.
