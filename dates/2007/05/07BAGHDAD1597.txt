¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: The majority of the Internally Displaced Persons 
(IDPs) in Dohuk Province are from two groups: Iraqi Christians from 
Mosul who moved for economic reasons or fled sectarian violence; and 
Iraqis from Baghdad and other parts of Iraq who fled due to the 
security environment. The office of the Governor of Dohuk Province 
told us the total number of IDP families reached 9,055 or 51,749 
individuals. He said the urgent needs of the IPDs are shelter and 
access to jobs and schools. The Governor has proposed setting up an 
IDP camp given the lack of public housing. The head of the Dohuk 
Directorate of IDPs stated also that mines pose a continuing danger 
for the IDPs. END SUMMARY. 
¶2.  (SBU) On April 3, IPAO Mergy traveled to Dohuk Province to 
attend the monthly conference chaired by the head of Dohuk 
Provincial Directorate for IDPs. She also attended a meeting on IDPs 
hosted by the Governor of Dohuk on April 15. At both meetings, 
representatives from UNHCR and various non-governmental 
organizations were present: Middle Market Development Foundation, 
Mining Advisory Group, International Relief and Development, Doste 
Gunda, Harika, International Medical Corp, International Red 
Crescent Society, Quandil, and Peace Winds Japan. The goal was to 
coordinate support to IDPs, especially recently arrived IDPs, and to 
identify funding sources and recent relief projects.   Participants 
gave an update on ongoing projects and clarified their roles and 
available resources. 
IDP POPULATION IN DOHUK 
¶3.  (SBU) At the April 3 conference, a representative of the 
provincial government stated the following information on the IDPs 
in the Dohuk Province: 
-- 9,055 IDP families or 51,749 individuals have arrived in Dohuk 
since 2005. (Note: UNHCR reports 8,436 IDP families for Dohuk 
Province for the same period.) 
-- Most of the IDPs now in Dohuk come from Mosul (6,771 families). 
Many of these had lived in Dohuk during the 1970s and 1980s, had 
returned to Mosul, and then went back again to Dohuk. 
-- There are approximately 7,300 Christian IDP families out of the 
total 9,055. 
-- 28,998 IDPs are above 18 years old and 13,307 are under 12 years 
old. 
-- The IDPs are stretching the capacity of the already limited 
number of essential services (fuel, electricity, water) and public 
infrastructure (schools, public housing, medical care). 
-- Schools in Dohuk have up to three shifts to accommodate the 
additional class size. To the degree possible, schools have 
introduced Arabic instruction for IDP students. 
-- Most of the new IDPs are living in rented facilities and will 
need to find alternative housing within a few months. Because of the 
acute shortage in shelters, a transit camp is foreseeable. 
-- The city of Fayda has received more than 750 newly arrived IDPs. 
The provincial government and NGOs provided support and assistance: 
kerosene, food, and non-food items. 
THE IMPORTANCE OF DEMINING FOR IDPs 
¶4.  (SBU) The head of the Dohuk Governorate Directorate of IDPs, 
Mousa Ali, said that there are three main locations of anti-personal 
mines in Dohuk area: Hetit, five kilometers from the Sheladize area, 
Amedi district in Fayda, and Domiz. (Note: On this information, IPAO 
Mergy consulted with the MAG representative who attended the April 3 
meeting. He told IPAO Mergy on April 29 that MAG is currently 
preparing a report covering these issues and will forward it to IPAO 
Mergy.) 
POSSIBLE INCREASED DISPLACEMENT DUE TO BORDER TENSIONS 
¶5.  (SBU) On April 15, the Governor of Dohuk chaired a special 
meeting on IDPs. He said that tensions on the Dohuk-Turkish border 
might lead to further displacement. He believes movement will occur 
both southward from the border and northward from Mosul.  The 
Governor explained that some fear a Turkish military intervention 
into Dohuk Province.  The northward movement from Mosul, he 
continued, is due to generalized violence and ethnic discrimination. 
 
MOTION TO CREATE AN IDP CAMP 
¶6.  (SBU) At the April 15 meeting, the Governor of Dohuk said that 
IDPs prefer to stay with friends or relatives rather than in a 
settlement area. Due to the lack of public housing and costs 
associated with building permanent structures, however, the Governor 
put forth the idea for newly arrived IDPs to be placed in a camp in 
one of the three following locations: Shlalat, Khorsabat or Daka. 
(Note: Shlalat is in Ninewa Province, not Kurdistan.) A camp set up 
in Shlalat, he added, would allow IDPs to remain close to 
educational facilities and family networks 
¶7.  (SBU) At the April 15 meeting, the UNHCR representative stressed 
the need for contingency planning and presented its key priorities 
in the event of major fighting along the border with Turkey that 
would result in large numbers of IDPs. The UNHCR Representative, 
however, underscored the need to integrate the IDPs rather than to 
create camps. 
¶8.  (SBU) COMMENT: The monthly IDP meetings hosted in Dohuk are 
well-organized and attended by UNHCR and the relevant 
non-governmental organizations and provincial government.  This 
regular interaction ensures that assistance efforts are not 
 
BAGHDAD 00001597  002 OF 002 
 
 
duplicated among the different organizations. The NGOs and the Dohuk 
provincial government are not able to cover all the needs of IDPs in 
the areas of shelter, educational facilities, and employment 
opportunities.
