REF: STATE 65371 
 
(SBU) Emboff briefed Gershon Kedar, the MFA's acting office 
director for UN political affairs, May 16 on the importance 
of international support for UNSCR 1267.  Kedar said that the 
GOI shares our views and will send an officer from the 
Israeli mission to attend the May 22 briefing on UN efforts 
to combat terrorism.  The GOI will likely refrain from an 
active role in the question and answer session.
