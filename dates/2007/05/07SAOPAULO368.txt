¶1. "Report Converts Israel Into 'Razed Land'" 
 
Center-right national circulation daily O Estado de S. Paulo's Paris 
correspondent Giles Lapouge commented (5/3): "Following the 
preliminary conclusions of the Winograd Committee report on the war 
between Israel and Lebanon last year, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has 
almost nothing left.... The episode is a turning point in Israel's 
history.... The Israeli Army obtained a series of victories during 
50 years and became a military power.... The Israeli defeat has had 
devastating political effects: the Middle East's geo-strategic 
landscape has been changing.... Lebanese Hezbollah may take 
advantage of the current demoralizing situation Israel is facing to 
attack once again." 
 
¶2. "One Less Ally?" 
 
IMF Executive Director [representing Brazil and eight other South 
American and Caribbean nations] Paulo Nogueira Batista wrote in 
liberal, largest national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo (5/3): 
"President Hugo Chvez announced that Venezuela will withdraw from 
the IMF and the World Bank.... Chvez's decision has a component 
that is understandable. Both the IMF and the World Bank are 
institutions strongly controlled by the U.S. and other developed 
nations. IMF-supported policies were frequently inadequate and 
helped to worsen the economic and political situation of nations 
that were obliged to resort to its loans.... However, President 
Chvez's decision is deplorable, and I hope that it will not be 
confirmed.... For Brazil and other South American nations, 
Venezuela's withdrawal would be a major loss. It represents one less 
ally in the current discussions on IMF reform.... Perhaps there is 
still time for the GOB to exert a moderating role and help to 
prevent a hasty decision that might isolate Venezuela and weaken its 
South American allies."
