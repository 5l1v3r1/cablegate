¶1.  We forwarded information concerning the Nuclear Smuggling 
International Technical Working Group (ITWG) to the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs on April 30 (ref a).  We included the 
offer from the US to pay for one representative from the 
Turkish Atomic Energy Authority (TAEK) and Turkish National 
Police (TNP).  On May 17, we received a reply from the GOT 
stating that the Turkish National Police will be sending 
Police Chief Salih Alper Mercan.  TNP is also appreciative of 
the offer of funding for his attendance. 
 
¶2.  Pol/Mil Counselor met with President of TAEK, Okay 
Cakiroglu on May 16 (ref b).  During the meeting, the ITWG 
was discussed.  Cakiroglu informed Pol/Mil Counselor that 
TAEK has not yet determined who will participate in the ITWG, 
but they do intend to have a representative at the meetings. 
Cakiroglu added that TAEK will not require US financial 
assistance.
