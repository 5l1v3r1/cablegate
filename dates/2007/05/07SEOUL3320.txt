SUBJECT: ROKG SHARES BROAD INTERPRETATION OF UNSCR 1747 
 
REF: STATE 67462 
 
(SBU) On May 22, poloff conveyed reftel points, encouraging 
governments to apply a broad definition of UNSCR 1747, to Ham 
Sangwook, First Secretary at MOFAT's Disarmament and 
Non-Proliferation Division.  Ham reconfirmed that the ROKG 
was fully committed to implementation of UNSCR 1737 and 1747 
and insisted that the ROKG maintained a strong export control 
system.  Seoul shared Washington's view that UNSCR 1747 
Operative Paragraph 5 should be broadly defined.  He added 
that the ROKG expected to submit its report on implementation 
of UNSCR 1747 by the May 24 deadline.
