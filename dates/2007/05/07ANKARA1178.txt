¶1.  (SBU) Summary: In a May 8 meeting, Turkey-Iraq Business Council 
Chairman Ercument Aksoy asked for help on accessing Japanese soft 
loans for Iraq, gaining good attendance at the Iraq Trade Fair in 
Gazientep later this month, and removing onerous performance bond 
requirements on bidders for Iraq projects.  He was optimistic on 
restarting limited fuel product trade with SOMO.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Japanese Soft Loans: Aksoy said that the Japanese pledged 
$3.5 billion in soft loans for Iraq at the Madrid Conference. 
Turkish Business Council companies have been shooting for these soft 
loans to support a variety of business projects from port and 
factory rehabilitation to irrigation.  Aksoy asked whether the USG 
supported Japanese soft loan financing to Turkish companies for 
projects in Iraq.  In response to our affirmative answer, he 
requested that the USG be willing to express this support.  (NOTE: 
NEA informed us that they were aware of some 14 projects under study 
by the Japanese -- with no U.S. companies involved, but there was a 
problem with the ability of the Iraqi Government to accept the 
loans.)  Aksoy said he can also work the issues with the Iraqis. 
 
¶3. (SBU) International Iraq Fair in Gaziantep May 23-27:  Aksoy 
asked for USG assistance to get a good turn out from Iraqi companies 
and officials, also hoping for USG representation.  This is the 
second annual Iraq business and trade fair organized in Gaziantep in 
south-east Turkey.  Separately, the hosts of the Gaziantep fair, the 
Chamber of Industry, told Adana Principle Officer that they are 
expecting 1000 companies and over 10,000 visitors to participate in 
the fair.  The mayor was also focused on the fair, noting that the 
city lacks adequate hotel capacity so they will use private homes to 
house people. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Aksoy complained that the Iraqi government placed an 
onerous and unreasonable 3% performance bond requirement on all 
foreign bidders on GOI tenders.  He said it would be okay farther 
along in selection process, but not at entry into bidding.  He hoped 
that the USG could encourage Iraq to adopt more reasonable bidding 
practices. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) SOMO:  Aksoy characterized the April meeting between SOMO 
and the GOT as positive (reftel), and he thought fuel trade exports 
would start back up soon with 5-6 companies.
