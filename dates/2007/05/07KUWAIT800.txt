SUBJECT: COURT ACQUITS THREE DEFENDANTS IN PENINSULA LIONS 
CASE 
 
REF: 06 KUWAIT 1594 
 
(SBU) On May 12, the Court of First Instance acquitted three 
defendants convicted of terrorism-related charges in the 
Peninsula Lions case (reftel).  Ahmed Abdullah Mohammed 
Al-Otaibi (Kuwaiti) was originally sentenced to seven years 
and four months hard labor; Abdul Latif Abdullah Abdul Hadi 
Al-Juwaisri (Kuwaiti) to four years and four months hard 
labor; and Mohammed Abdul Razzak Sheikh Essa (Somali) to four 
years and four months hard labor followed by deportation. 
Al-Juwaisri was the only defendant present in court; the 
other two are still fugitives and were acquitted in absentia. 
 According to press reports, Al-Juwaisri's attorney claimed 
his client was tortured by Kuwait State Security personnel 
after being handed over to Kuwaiti authorities by Syria, 
where he was imprisoned for seven months and also subject to 
torture.  Judge Abdullah Al-Sane cited lack of "convincing 
evidence" and "testimonial ambiguity" as the justification 
for the ruling.  The Public Prosecution is planning to appeal 
the verdicts.
