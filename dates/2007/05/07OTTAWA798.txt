(U) Econoff delivered points in reftel to Doug Rubbra, Senior 
Trade Policy Officer, Multilateral Market Access, Department 
of Foreign Affairs and International Trade.  Rubbra explained 
that Canada is well aware of the U.S. negotiating text on 
textiles, apparel, footwear, and travel goods and that 
officers in Canada's WTO mission in Geneva are in close 
contact with their U.S. counterparts.  Rubbra explained that 
the main sticking point preventing Canada from co-sponsoring 
the U.S. text is the Canadian requirement that the name or ID 
number of the dealer be included on the permanent label.  He 
said that he and his colleagues are studying both the U.S. 
and E.U. texts and deciding how to proceed.
