POWER PROJECT 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary: An April 14 Financial Times article quoted a 
Libyan official as saying that Libya was in discussions with South 
Korea and other countries about a nuclear power plant project.  On 
May 7, Embassy received a letter from the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and Trade (MOFAT) saying that Korea was concerned that the 
report may have sent the wrong message to Korea's U.S. ally.  In 
fact, the letter said, Libya had approached Korea about cooperation 
on nuclear power, but Korea concluded that such cooperation would be 
premature.  Korea prefers to start any cooperation with Libya more 
gradually with nuclear medicine or joint studies.  Post had 
previously heard that Korea had held conversations with Indonesia 
and Vietnam about potential cooperation on nuclear energy, but this 
was the first we had heard about feelers from Libya.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  (U) The Financial Times article, headlined "Libya to Get Nuclear 
Power Plant," says that Libya is pushing ahead with plans to build a 
civilian nuclear power plant with the hope that Western nations will 
provide technical and financial assistance.  Quoting Matoug Matoug, 
Secretary-General of the General Peoples Committee on manpower, 
 
SIPDIS 
employment and training (also identified as former head of Libya's 
nuclear program), the article says that Libya has been in 
discussions about the project with U.S., Russian, French, Argentine 
and South Korean officials.  "We will have the Koreans pretty soon, 
the Russians are coming, also the French, we are working on talking 
with them," Matoug reportedly said. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) On May 7, ESTH Chief received a letter dated May 2, signed 
by Park Noh-wan, Director of the Economic Security Division, 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MOFAT).  Following is the 
text of the letter: 
 
Begin text: 
 
Regarding the issue of Korea's cooperation with Libya in the field 
of nuclear energy, I would like to inform you that the Korean 
government is not considering participation in the nuclear power 
plant program that the Libyan government is trying to set up. 
 
As you many have seen in the Financial Times dated April 14, Mr. 
Matoug, Secretary-General of the General Peoples Committee of 
Manpower, Employment and Training, stated in an interview that the 
Libyan government had been in discussion about the nuclear power 
plant project with South Korea and added that South Korea would join 
the project pretty soon.  The Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
Trade is concerned that the contents of this interview may have sent 
the wrong message to the United States, a close political and 
economic ally of the Republic of Korea. 
 
In fact, last year Libya did propose to Korea cooperation in the 
nuclear sector, including on the SMART project and nuclear power 
plant construction.  After analyzing relevant agency opinions and 
Libya's current situation, the Ministry concluded that it would be 
premature to take part in the Libyan nuclear power plant project or 
negotiate an agreement of nuclear cooperation and that rather, it 
would be better to cooperate gradually starting from lower stages 
such as nuclear medicine or joint studies. 
 
I hope the above explanation will clarify our stance on this matter 
for you and your government.  In addition, we would welcome any 
requests for further discussion on this issue. 
 
On behalf of the Ministry, I would like to respectfully ask for your 
continued assistance and support in further advancing the 
cooperative relations between our two countries in nuclear energy 
and other related areas.

¶4.  (U) Note:  SMART stands for "System-Integrated Modular Advanced 
Reactor," a small (330MW) pressurized water reactor with integral 
steam generators that Korea has been developing for applications 
such as seawater desalination and small-scale electricity 
generation.  End note. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Comment:  Post had previously heard that Korea had held 
conversations with Indonesia and Vietnam about potential cooperation 
on nuclear power, but this the first we have heard about Libyan 
feelers in this area.  End comment. 
 
¶6.  (U) Minimize considered.
