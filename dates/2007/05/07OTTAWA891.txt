¶1. Emboff delivered reftel demarche to Erum Hasan, Advisor in the 
Multilateral Affairs Division at Environment Canada, on May 4. 
After consulting with senior officials, including Canada's CITES 
Scientific Authorities, Hasan responded on May 10 that Canada had 
yet to establish firm positions on the matters raised in demarche. 
 
¶2. GoC officials are hoping to discuss the U.S. proposals, as well 
as the German proposals noted reftel with USG and Mexican officials 
at the upcoming meeting of the Trilateral Committee for Wildlife and 
Ecosystem Conservation and Management May 14-18 in Quebec City. 
According to Hasan, the GoC expects to determine Canadian positions 
on these proposals during those meetings.  From the Canadian 
perspective, a major focus of the Quebec City meetings will be to 
try to reach a harmonized North American approach for the CITES COP 
14 meeting.  To date, Mission Canada has received country clearance 
requests for approximately 60 American participants in the Quebec 
City meetings, most of whom are USG officials from USFWS & DOI, 
State, USDA, NOAA, and USGS, but also including representatives from 
state governments and NGOs.
