SUBJECT: MFO TWIN OTTER CRASHES, KILLING ALL NINE ON BOARD 
 
The Multinational Force and Observers (MFO) Cairo 
Representative reported that the MFO's French-operated Twin 
Otter aircraft crashed at approximately 10:00 a.m. local on 
May 6, killing all nine people (eight French and one 
Canadian) on board.  The representative said the MFO lost 
contact with the plane at approximately 09:30 a.m. and 
believe that mechanical difficulties prompted the pilot to 
attempt an emergency landing on a highway approximately 40 
kilometers north-west of the beach resort of Taba.  According 
to press reports, eye-witnesses said the plane's wing hit a 
tanker truck when it landed on the highway, causing the plane 
to catch fire.  An investigation is ongoing. Post has 
extended offers of support to MFO and the French and Canadian 
Embassies and is in contact with MFO Headquarters in Rome.
