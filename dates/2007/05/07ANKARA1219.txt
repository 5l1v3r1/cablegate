CHOD GEN Buyukanit Speaks at War College 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶1. Chief of the Turkish General Staff (CHOD) General Yasar Buyukanit 
gave his annual speech to the War College in Istanbul on March 16. 
In contrast to previous years, the speech was closed to the press, 
but was subsequently leaked to the media.  In the speech, Buyukanit 
refrained from comment about the upcoming presidential election, 
noting that it was not military's duty to comment on political 
issues.  Touching upon various issues like Cyprus, Turkey's 
contributions to peacekeeping operations, ISAF, the fight against 
the PKK terrorist organization and the PKK's presence in northern 
Iraq, GEN Buyukanit listed ethnic separatism, terrorism and 
fundamentalism as the primary threats facing Turkey.  Buyukanit 
underscored the constitutional responsibility of the Turkish Armed 
Forces to preserve the unitary structure of the country against such 
threats, and stressed the military's determination to safeguard the 
Republic.

the meeting, as reported by center-left Radikal daily. 
 
Defense Industry Executive Committee Convenes

¶3. Turkey's top decision making body on defense industrial

Gonul, Head of Plans and Principles Department GEN Hilmi Akin Zorlu,

Industries (SSM).  Agusta Westland of Italy was selected over South 
Africa's Denel for Turkey's purchase of up to 50 tactical and 
reconnaissance Attack (ATAK) Helicopters, while Otokar of Turkey was
