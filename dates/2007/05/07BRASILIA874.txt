SUBJECT: BRAZIL'S ENVIRONMENT MINISTER SILVA DISCUSSES MINISTRY 
PRIORITIES 
 
 
¶1. SUMMARY. During a wide-ranging conversation with Ambassador Sobel 
and other Embassy staff on May 11, 2007, Brazil's Minister for the 
Environment, Marina Silva, discussed bilateral and multilateral 
cooperation.  Topics included Brazil's proposal regarding 
compensated deforestation, Ministry priorities, the Tropical Forest 
Conservation Act and the Coalition Against Wildlife Trafficking 
(CAWT). END SUMMARY 
 
¶2.  Minister Silva outlined Brazil's proposal for Compensated 
Reduction of Deforestation to address climate change.  This 
proposal, which Brazil tabled at the United Nations Climate Change 
Conference meeting in Nairobi last November, advocates the creation 
of a voluntary fund that would reward developing countries for their 
already completed efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 
reducing deforestation.  Funds would be donated voluntarily by 
developed countries.  Ambassador Sobel said while the White House 
was interested in learning more, the U.S. Treasury had expressed 
concerns about setting up a new multilateral funding mechanism. 
Minister Silva said that it would be similar to the PPG7 fund, in 
which donors had put billions to preserve the Amazon.  The new fund 
would operate similarly but instead provide fiscal incentives for 
voluntary reductions in deforestation.  Minister Silva promised the 
Ambassador more detailed information on Brazil's proposal after this 
week's meeting in Bonn but before the G-8. 
 
¶3.  Ambassador Sobel suggested that it might be useful for Minister 
Silva to meet with U.S. Treasury Secretary Paulson during his 
upcoming visit to Brazil in July.  Because he is concerned about the 
environment, Paulson should hear from the Minister about Brazil's 
efforts to create protected areas. Minister Silva responded 
positively to the suggestion. Subjects for discussion between the 
two could include the Amazon Region Protected Areas Program (ARPA), 
pollutant emission reduction and the Chico Mendes Institute. 
 
¶4. Minster Silva listed the priorities for the Ministry as the 
development of parks, the creation of conservation units, tropical 
forest management, reduced deforestation and the establishment of 
the Chico Mendes Institute. 
 
¶5. On the subject of the proposed Tropical Forest Conservation Act, 
Minister Silva said she had concerns about the composition of the 
Board that would administer the funds, that funds would only go to 
NGO's and expressed her preference that no Board member have the 
right to veto. 
 
¶6. Concerning the Department's Coalition Against Wildlife 
Trafficking (CAWT) initiative, Minister Silva repeated concerns that 
Brazil still needed clarification on how the Initiative would relate 
to CITES and believed that flora and trafficking in genetic 
resources, biopiracy, should be included. Until those issues are 
resolved, Brazil would continue to be an observer at CAWT meetings 
she said. (The paper Minister Silva presented outlining Brazil's 
concerned was sent to the Department previously.) 
 
¶7. Ambassador Sobel encouraged Minister Silva to participate in the 
May 17 U.S.-Brazil Common Agenda for the Environment meetings 
scheduled in Brasilia, so that the Ministry's opinions on issues are 
heard. 
 
¶8. NOTE:  Brazil's Ministry of the Environment was hit with a strike 
which began, May 14.  The 6000 plus employees of IBAMA, the 
enforcement division of the Ministry, are striking to prevent the 
enactment of a proposed reorganization under which they would lose 
some of their authority to the newly created Chico Mendes Institute. 
Brazil's President Lula signed an act to implement the 
reorganization, but it has to be confirmed by the Brazilian Congress 
within 30 days.  IBAMA's workers plan to stay out until the issue is 
resolved.
