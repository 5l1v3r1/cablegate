Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused news 
coverage May 9 on the fist fighting in the Legislative Yuan Tuesday 
over the Organic Law of the Central Election Commission; on the 2008 
presidential election; and on a scandal over a local TV network 
allegedly falsifying information in a documentary on the 2-28 
Incident of 1947.   The pro-status quo "China Times" front-paged a 
banner headline that said, "China Times' Latest Opinion Survey:  Ma 
Wins Hsieh by Nine Percentage Points Only."  In terms of editorials 
and commentaries, an editorial in the pro-independence, 
English-language "Taipei Times" discussed the Legislative Yuan's 
failure to pass the government's annual budget.  The article said 
the pan-Blue camp's obstruction of a special budget for the U.S. 
arms procurements was "a setback for Taiwan's security and foreign 
relations."  End summary. 
 
"Obstructionist Tactics Hurt Everyone" 
 
The pro-independence, English-language "Taipei Times" [circulation: 
30,000] editorialized (5/9): 
 
"... However, the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) has forced the 
legislature to review its proposed - possibly unconstitutional - 
amendment to the Organic Law of the Central Election Commission 
before passing the budget, causing more than five months of 
deadlock.  As a result, the opposition should bear the greatest 
responsibility. 
 
"The pan-blue camp, which has refused to pass a special budget for 
the US arms procurement package, now wants it put in the annual 
budget.  Therefore, it, too, remains frozen in the legislature. 
Taiwan's efforts to update its military have been stalled, and 
friends like the US have begun to doubt whether Taiwan has the 
resolve to defend itself and whether it is sincere as an ally.  This 
has been a setback for Taiwan's security and foreign relations. 
..."
