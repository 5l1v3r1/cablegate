SUBJECT: CAMBODIA ON BILATERAL SHIPBOARDING AGREEMENT 
 
REF: STATE 57843 
 
 ¶1.  (U)  On May 10, A/DCM met with Yos Makana who is head of 
the Department of the Americas, as well as her deputy, Chhay 
Song Heng to discuss the shipboarding agreement and provide 
the draft talking points included in reftel.  Makana was 
pleased to receive USG reassurances, but noted that following 
the earlier Embassy meeting with MFA Secretary of State Ouch 
Borith, the MFA had sent the draft agreement to the 
Ministries of Defense and Transport for comment.  So far, the 
MFA has not had any response.  Makana noted that she would 
provide both Ministries with the talking points as well as 
the list of other countries with which the USG has signed a 
bilateral shipboarding agreement.  She asked that the USG 
give Cambodia an opportunity to more fully digest the draft 
agreement and identify potential areas where further 
clarification and discussion might be necessary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Comment.  The RGC is not ready for a USG team 
visit at this stage.  We suggest waiting a month before 
querying the MFA again, at which point we will try to 
identify officials within the relevant Ministries apart from 
the MFA with a stake in this initiative, and meet separately 
with them to try and move the RGC along.  End Comment.
