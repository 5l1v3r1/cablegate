SUBJECT: CZECHS AGREE THAT UPCOMING SYRIAN ELECTION WILL 
NOT BE DEMOCRATIC 
 
REF: STATE 71071 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) Czech MFA Syria desk officer Jaromir Marek told 
Poloff on May 25 that the Czech Republic agrees that the 
upcoming presidential election in Syria will not be free and 
fair. He chuckled at the very idea of using the word 
"election" in connection with the event, observing that it is 
really a "referendum" in which the only possible "vote" is 
"yes." Marek said the Czech Republic has no official position 
on the Syrian election, other than the view that Syria is not 
a democratic country. Marek said the Czechs focus their 
attention on human rights abuses in Syria.
