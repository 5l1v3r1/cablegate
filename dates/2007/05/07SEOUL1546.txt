REF: STATE 67444 
 
(SBU) Poloff on May 17 conveyed reftel points seeking a 
postponement of a PRC resolution at the World Organization 
for Animal Health (OIE) that might obstruct Taiwan's 
continued OIE participation to Lee Yoon-jong, WTO Division 
Deputy Director at MOFAT's Multilateral Trade Bureau.  On May 
21, Lee officially noted that, like the USG, the ROKG 
preferred that the PRC and Taiwan find a mutually acceptable 
resolution.  However, if the PRC and Taiwan failed to reach a 
consensus and the issue were put to a vote, the ROKG would 
have to "wait and see" how the situation developed before 
deciding on a response.  The possible vote was unlikely to 
occur before May 25, so there was time for events to unfold 
further, Lee added.  Speaking personally, Lee shared the view 
that the OIE should focus on animal health and not be 
sidetracked by a China-Taiwan political issue.
