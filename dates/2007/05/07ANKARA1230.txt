¶1. (SBU) This is another in a series of periodic reports on PKK 
violence in Turkey.  Our primary sources for these reports are 
mainstream Turkish press services, such as the Anatolian News 
Agency, and international wire services.  While these are more 
reliable than most Turkish press sources, they are not necessarily 
unimpeachable.  A major source is the Turkish Armed Forces General 
Staff (TGS) website which documents contacts/clashes with the PKK. 
Press services sympathetic to the PKK, such as Neu-Isenburg People's 
Defense Forces and Firat News Agency, tend to report higher numbers 
of the Turkish Security Forces casualties and are often otherwise 
unreliable. 
 
¶2. (U) From May 1-15, 2007, six security personnel died in clashes 
with the PKK or in IED explosions in Diyarbakir, Sirnak and Hakkari 
provinces.  During the same period 19 security officials were 
wounded. 
 
¶3. (U) The TGS website for the first half of May did not refer to 
any PKK terrorists being killed, but did report that security forces 
arrested 27 PKK terrorists.  Among those 27, three were turned over 
by the KDP at the Turkey-Iraq border, and another three by Iranian 
authorities. 
 
¶4. (U) The Turkish military reported 20 clashes between security 
forces and PKK terrorists in the region.  Security forces unearthed 
dozens of PKK shelters and caves and seized booby-trapped land 
mines; other explosives, including A-4 and TNT; Kalashnikov rifles; 
cartridges; hand grenades; pistols; night vision binoculars; TV 
sets; satellite antennas; and radios.
