SUBJECT: GERMAN QUERY CONCERNING RUSSIAN SUPPLY OF NUCLEAR 
FUEL TO INDIA'S TARAPUR REACTOR 
 
 
¶1. (U) This message contains an action request -- please see 
paragraph 4. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Joerg Polster, German MFA International Energy and 
Nuclear Energy Policy desk officer, queried Global Affairs 
officer May 23 concerning press reports that Russia had 
delivered a batch of nuclear fuel to two reactors at Tarapur, 
India, in April 2007.  Polster noted that one article quoted 
an unnamed U.S. official as saying "this kind of activity 
should not take place" because Moscow had acted outside the 
guidelines of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) to allow fuel 
to be supplied to states that had not signed the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT).  According to the press 
reports, NSG guidelines allow the supply of fuel to non-NPT 
states if a safety hazard can be averted by refueling 
reactors at risk.  The U.S. official is quoted as saying that 
Tarapur is not at risk now and therefore should not receive 
the fuel from Russia at this time. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Polster queried the accuracy of this press report 
and said the German Government would like to know the USG's 
official reaction to Russia's provision of nuclear fuel to 
India in this case. 
 
¶4. (U) Post requests guidance on how to respond to the German 
Government's request.
