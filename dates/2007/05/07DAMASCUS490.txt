REF: A. SECSTATE 64154 
     ¶B. DAMASCUS 0077 
 
¶1.  (SBU) In accordance with ref A, Post has reviewed the 
relevant country documents.  Our only substantive comment is 
that the documents do not refer to the phenomenon since late 
2005 of Iraqi Palestinians attempting to flee Iraq to Syria. 
Currently, an estimated 310 Palestinian Iraqis live in the 
El-Hol refugee camp in northeastern Syria, while another 
estimated 350 persons are camped out on the Syrian side of 
the no-man's-land in the eastern Syria-Iraq border crossing 
of al-Tanef.  Additionally, as reported in ref B, officials 
from the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in 
the Near East (UNRWA) have told us that they suspect that up 
to 7,000 other Iraqi Palestinians may have entered the 
country using fake Iraqi documents that do not indicate their 
Palestinian background, although only 241 Iraqi Palestinian 
children have entered UNRWA schools this year. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) In response to ref A's query about UNICEF's overall 
effectiveness in country, Post notes that UNICEF seems to 
have a good working relationship with the Syrian government, 
despite significant political and security constraints on all 
international organizations working here.  UNICEF also 
cooperates effectively with other international organizations 
and the USG in Syria.
