¶1.  (SBU) The office of Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) 
Under Secretary Sayyid Badr al-Busaidi has confirmed that the 
Under Secretary will be available to conduct the next round 
of Gulf Security Dialogue (GSD) talks in Washington, D.C. the 
morning of June 18.  Sayyid Badr has requested that he be 
allowed to present an overview of Oman's policy goals and 
security situation at the beginning of the talks.  He has 
further asked that the U.S. provide an agenda and read-ahead 
briefing materials as soon as possible so that the Omani 
government can timely determine what other officials should 
be included in its GSD delegation. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Comment:  Sayyid Badr was the principal Omani 
interlocutor for the first round of GSD talks in Muscat on 
October 17, 2006 (ref C).  He also received Acting ASD Mary 
Beth Long during this year's U.S.-Oman Joint Military 
Commission (ref B).  Given the importance of the read-ahead 
information, post seeks to directly participate in the 
drafting of briefing documents for the GSD.  End Comment.
