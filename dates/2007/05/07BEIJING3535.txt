¶1. Key points at the May 24 MFA Press Conference were: 
 
-- IAEA and UNSC decisions must be implemented, but all 
parties must intensify diplomatic efforts so as to arrive at 
an enduring, comprehensive solution that serves the interests 
of all, said the spokeswoman. 
 
-- China hopes the Sudanese Government can exert greater 
flexibility and that relevant parties can seize this 
opportunity to build mutual trust and implement the third 
phase of the Annan plan. 
 
-- China pays high attention to food and drug safety and is 
positive about international cooperation in this area. 
 
-- The eighth round of East China Sea talks will open in 
Beijing on May 25. 
 
-- Responding to a question about a plea for a Burmese 
pro-democracy activist's release made by First Lady Laura 
Bush and members of Congress, the spokeswoman said Burmese 
political reform is an internal affair. 
 
Intensify Diplomatic Efforts on Iran Nuclear Issue 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶2. Asked at the May 24 regular press briefing for comment on 
an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report 
concluding that Iran has not complied with UNSC resolutions 
regarding its nuclear program, MFA Spokeswoman Jiang Yu said 
that decisions of the IAEA and UNSC must be implemented, but 
that in the mean time, all parties must intensify diplomatic 
efforts and adopt constructive approaches so as to arrive at 
an enduring, comprehensive solution that serves the interests 
of all.  Jiang added that China will carefully study the IAEA 
report, which she expects to be "objective and professional 
as always." 
 
Special Africa Envoy's Visit to Sudan 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. During a recent trip to Sudan, Special Envoy for Africa 
Affairs Liu Guijin visited the Darfur region and met with the 
President of Sudan and other officials to exchange views on 
the Darfur issue, stated Jiang.  She expressed China's hope 
that the Sudanese Government can exert greater flexibility 
and that relevant parties can seize this opportunity to build 
mutual trust, implement the third phase of the Annan plan and 
reach a political solution based on dialogue and peaceful 
negotiations. 
 
Tainted Toothpaste 
------------------ 
 
¶4. Asked for confirmation that the United States is checking 
all Chinese imported shipments of toothpaste for harmful 
chemicals, the spokeswoman said she had no details on the 
matter.  Asked about tainted Chinese toothpaste exports to 
Panama and general alarm over Chinese food exports, Jiang 
emphasized that the Administration for Quality Supervision, 
Inspection and Quarantine has responded to the issue, adding 
that China pays high attention to food and drug safety and is 
positive about international cooperation in this area. 
 
8th East China Sea Talks in Beijing: Distance Remains 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶5. The eighth round of East China Sea talks will open in 
Beijing on May 25, said Jiang responding to multiple 
questions on the topic.  China is ready to press ahead with 
consultations in line with the five-point consensus reached 
by leaders outlined in a recent joint communique on planning 
mutually beneficial joint development acceptable to both 
sides.  The unilateral "middle line" proposal by Japan is not 
acceptable to China and will not be discussed, Jiang added 
when pressed. 
 
China-Japan Meeting at G8 Not Confirmed 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. China, India, Mexico and other nations will participate in 
the G8 dialogues with developing countries during the summit 
at Heiligendamm, Germany, stated Jiang when asked about 
 
BEIJING 00003535  002 OF 002 
 
 
rumors of a China-Japan meeting on the sidelines of the 
summit.  Issues to be addressed include innovation, IPR 
protection, trade liberalization, energy, climate change and 
aid to Africa, said the spokeswoman. 
 
Burma Political Reform an Internal Affair 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. Burma political reform is an internal affair and should be 
settled by the Burmese Government and people, said Jiang, 
responding to a question about a plea for pro-democracy 
activist Aung San Suu Kyi's release made by First Lady Laura 
Bush together with various members of Congress.  China hopes 
international efforts can be constructive in helping Burma 
with political reconciliation. 
 
FM Yang Congratulates New DPRK FM 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶8. FM Yang sent a congratulatory telegram to the DPRK's newly 
appointed Foreign Minister, confirmed Jiang when asked what 
China's expectations were for the new FM. 
 
China Ready to Work with NATO 
----------------------------- 
 
¶9. China has had various levels and forms of dialogue with 
NATO to establish mutual trust and a security concept based 
on equality, said Jiang when asked about Xinhua reports that 
NATO wants to establish direct military connection with the 
Chinese military.  In recent years, China has held the first 
Director General-level consultations on nonproliferation and 
other issues, she said, adding that China is ready to work 
with NATO on the basis of equality and mutual trust to 
maintain contact and enhance exchanges with the goal of 
increasing mutual understanding and furthering peace and 
stability.
