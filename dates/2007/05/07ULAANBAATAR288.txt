(SBU) E/P Chief met on May 15 with MFA Director for Multilateral 
Relations Ms. Enkhtsetseg and drew on reftel points to urge that 
Mongolia send a high-level, multi-sectoral delegation to the 
upcoming OSCE conference on the Public-Private Partnership in 
Combating Terrorism.  Enkhtsetseg expressed appreciation for the 
U.S. points and agreed with the value of the topic.  In view of 
MFA's limited travel budget, however, she said she was unsure 
Mongolia could send anyone from Ulaanbaatar.  She promised to 
circulate the U.S. points to other relevant GOM agencies, who might 
be able to participate.  If they could not, she said, then Mongolia 
would be represented at the conference by its mission in Geneva.
