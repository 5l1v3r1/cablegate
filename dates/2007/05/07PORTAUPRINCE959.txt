SUBJECT: HAITIAN DELEGATION PLEASED WITH WASHINGTON VISIT 
 
Classified By: Classified by Ambassador Janet A. Sanderson for reasons 
1.4(b) and (d). 
 
¶1.  (C)  Members of the delegation who accompanied President 
Preval and other Haitian officials informed Emboffs that 
Preval was very pleased with the reception he received from 
President Bush, Secretary Rice, other USG officials and 
members of Congress.  Presidential counselor Gabriel Verret 
claimed in a conversation with Polcouns that Preval was 
neither surprised nor taken aback by President Bush's 
concerns regarding Haitian-Venezuelan relations.  Verret 
related that when the White House regretfully asked the 
Haitian delegation to change the time of the meeting with 
President Bush on short notice, President Preval instructed 
him to accommodate the White House, saying the most important 
goal of the trip was to see President Bush and make him 
understand where he (Preval) stood on Venezuela.  Verret said 
they joked afterward that they should have been prepared to 
explain their Venezuela policy with a Haitian proverb, "The 
bigger imbecile than the one who gives is the one who doesn't 
take." 
 
¶2.  (C)  In a separate conversation with Polcouns, unofficial 
presidential advisor and veteran Hill lobbyist Leonel 
Delatour downplayed the friction reportedly caused by the 
issue of granting Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to 
Haitians illegally in the U.S. between President Preval and 
some members of Congress.  The leadership of the 
Congressional Black Caucus, he said, respected President 
Preval's position not to raise TPS with President Bush.  When 
asked why President Preval would even consider advocating for 
an issue at odds with his campaign to promote a return of 
people and investment to Haiti, Delatour replied that as a 
small, poor country, Haiti could not afford to alienate any 
friends on the Hill, especially those who had been 
instrumental in passing HOPE legislation. 
 
¶3. (C)  Foreign Minister Clerisme and Prime Minster Alexis 
(neither of whom accompanied Preval) also expressed the GoH's 
overall satisfaction with the Washington visit in meetings 
with the Ambassador.  Clerisme took pains to excuse his 
absence, noting the importance of the CARICOM heads of state 
preparatory meeting President Preval had asked him to attend. 
The PM said that the President was particularly pleased with 
prospects for continued cooperation in taking advantage of 
the HOPE legislation and further counter-narcotics 
legislation. (Note. Nonetheless, Prevals' intimates expressed 
to Ambassador anger at how hard some CBC members pressed the 
President on TPS. One member of the CBC walked out of the 
meeting with Preval, a breech of protocol that upset Preval's 
colleagues. End note.) 
 
¶4.  (C)  Comment.  Preval's visit appears to have underlined 
for the delegation the importance of the Haiti-U.S. 
partnership and their need to cultivate Washington 
decision-makers.  Post is confident that the trip established 
the groundwork for closer consultations with the GoH on 
issues such as drugs and anti-corruption cooperation.  Of 
some concern, however, is Preval's continued blase attitude 
toward staffing.  Among those accompanying Preval, economic 
advisor/fiance Elizabeth Delatour appears firmly established 
as his closest confidante and factotum, but appears to play 
little role in promoting or implementing policy, and is thus 
of limited utility as a contact in promoting the bilateral 
agenda.  On the positive side, Gabriel Verret remains a 
reliable and valuable interlocutor.  Preval continues to rely 
on Leonel Delatour in dealing with the Hill, but otherwise 
appears to keep him at arms-length on policy, resulting in 
Preval's inconsistent and contradictory stand on TPS with the 
Hill and the White House.  We hope that President Bush's 
clear message on Venezuela sank in, but only time will tell. 
Preval answers only to himself on Venezuela policy, and he 
may not be able to resist displaying some show of 
independence or contrariness in dealing with Chavez in the 
future.
