local dailies (see press summaries for April 27 and May 1). 
Elections were renewed in the district municipality assembly on 
May 2 because the former mayor was disqualified by the

that, back in time, the Supreme Court's Chief Prosecutor issued 
a warning against DTP for the co-chairmanship structure it

the warning, but the co-chairmanship title was continued de 
facto in the party circles.

against whom search order was issued in the Diyarbakir province.
