¶1. (SBU)  Special Representative for Kosovo Final Status 
Talks Ambassador Frank Wisner and Ambassador Ricciardone met 
with Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa and Foreign 
Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit on April 30, soliciting support 
for Kosovo's independence following an anticipated May vote 
in the UNSC.  Ambassador Wisner underscored that Kosovo will 
eventually become independent but that an orderly, 
internationally monitored turn over of power would be a far 
better option than potential chaos which could result if the 
UNSC resolution is vetoed. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Moussa pledged to ensure the Arab League moves 
quickly to recognize Kosovo's independence following the 
passage of a UNSCR, and agreed to encourage Indonesia to vote 
for the resolution or abstain.  Noting Russia's hesitance to 
approve the resolution, Moussa hinted at a US-Russian 
trade-off on Kosovo in exchange for a more amicable deal on 
the proposed missile defense shield.  Wisner emphasized that 
there is "no deal making," stressing that all negotiations 
are contained "within the borders of Kosovo." He added if the 
Russians do veto the UNSCR, and the Kosovars declare 
independence, the United States will ask for Arab League 
support in recognizing the new nation.  Moussa suggested that 
a vote before the UNGA might be helpful in establishing a 
broad mandate for independence, should the UNSCR fail. 
Wisner noted that, while eventually working with the General 
Assembly could be a useful part of the recognition process, 
the UNSC was the necessary forum in which to address 
retirement of UNSCR 1244. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Moussa referenced an April meeting with a Serbian 
envoy who proposed that Kosovo, instead of an independent 
country, be turned into an autonomous territory of Serbia. 
Noting that Kosovo had "autonomous" status under the 
Milosevic regime (which was unilaterally revoked by 
Belgrade), Wisner said this proposed autonomy would not 
guarantee Kosovar representation in parliament, the right to 
independent currency, or border control.  The Ahtisaari 
package, he countered, grants Serbs a number of rights 
including independent municipalities, schools, judges, and 
religious freedom. 
 
¶4. (SBU)  In a subsequent meeting on April 30, FM Aboul Gheit 
asked a variety of questions about the underlying U.S. 
assumptions related to Kosovo Final Status.  He expressed 
concern about the functionality of the Ahtisaari package. 
Aboul Gheit also questioned the urgency of settling final 
status now.  Defending the Ahtisaari proposal, Wisner said 
Kosovo's status has been unresolved for eight years, and that 
the UNMIK's ability to carry out its is mandate ending. 
Though he promised to recognize Kosovo's statehood after the 
passage of a UNSCR calling for independence, Aboul Gheit 
declared that the GOE will not intervene on behalf of the 
resolution, especially with noncommittal South Africa.  He 
promised to brief President Mubarak on the contents of this 
meeting.
