¶1. (U) This is a PRT Anbar reporting cable. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Summary: CODEL Baird, which consisted of 
Representatives Brian Baird (D-WA) and Christopher Shays 
(R-CT), visited Camp Blue Diamond in Ramadi on May 22, where 
the congressmen met with the Mayor of Ramadi and Sheikh Ahmed 
Abu Risha, a Provincial Council member and the older brother 
of Sheikh Sattar Abu Risha, who has led local tribal leaders 
in the battle against al-Qaeda.  Ahmed described U.S. forces 
in Iraq as &friendly forces,8 cautioned against a 
precipitous U.S. withdrawal, and foresaw the need for Iraq to 
enter into a security arrangement with the U.S. similar to 
those between the U.S. and other Gulf states.  Ahmed is part 
of a PRT Anbar-nominated International Visitors delegation. 
The CODEL urged us to expedite the travel of that delegation 
to the US.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------- 
U.S. is a "Friendly Force" 
-------------------------- 
¶3. (U)  Codel Baird traveled to Camp Blue Diamond in Anbar 
Province on May 22 for an area orientation brief by MNF-West 
Commanding General, MGen Walter Gaskin, MNF-W G-5 Chief and 
PRT Anbar Political Officer.  Also at Blue Diamond, the CODEL 
met with Ramadi Mayor Latif Abbod Iada and Sheikh Ahmed Abu 
Risha, a member of the Anbar Provincial Council and a 
founding member of the Iraqi Awakening Movement (SAI), an 
anti-insurgent tribal coalition operating in the Ramadi area. 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) After an exchange of warm greetings, Sheikh Ahmed 
repeated a phrase used frequently bySAI members:  he 
described U.S. forces in Iraq as "friendly forces."   He 
expressed appreciation for the sacrifices the U.S. has made 
in blood and treasure in Iraq, and signaled his personal 
strong relationship with U.S. forces in the province and with 
PRT Anbar.  Ahmed urged an ongoing U.S. presence to defeat 
Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI). 
 
---------------------------------------- 
U.S. Withdrawal Would be a "Catastrophe" 
---------------------------------------- 
5 (SBU) Ahmed observed that Anbar Province has made 
significant progress on the security front in the past six 
months, and that AQI has been "severely diminished."  He 
stated that AQI is an illegitimate force that would ruin 
Iraq, and that Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) are still not 
strong enough to defend the country.   Ahmed foresaw the need 
for the U.S. to remain committed to Iraq until the ISF can 
stand on its own, building not a sectarian Iraqi Army but a 
national one. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Ahmed opined that a precipitous U.S. withdrawal 
would be a "catastrophe" for Iraq and the region, occasioned 
by mass killings in Iraq, and &chaos8 in Jordan and Saudi 
Arabia.  In his view, a U.S. departure would leave Iraq wide 
open to be taken over by Iran.  He offered that Syria and 
Iran are colluding to destabilize the country.  Ahmed 
envisioned that Iraq eventually would establish a cooperative 
security agreement with the U.S., similar to agreements the 
U.S. has with the other Gulf Arab nations. 
 
----------------- 
PRT Anbar Comment 
----------------- 
¶7. (SBU) PRT Anbar has nominated Sheikh Ahmed and seven other 
Anbari leaders, including Gov. Ma,amoun Sami Rasheed, to 
participate in the Department,s International Visitor,s 
Leadership Program (IVLP).  Our target date for the group to 
arrive in Washington is the first week of September. 
However, the CODEL urged us to expedite the travel so that 
the Anbaris might tell the U.S. public of the progress that 
has been achieved in their province.
