¶1.  SUMMARY:  The Assessment and Evaluation Commission (AEC) held 
its 20th plenary session in Khartoum on May 15.  AEC Chair Vraalsen 
delivered a summary of his May assessment trip to Kordofan, Blue 
Nile, Khartoum, and Bahr al Jabel states.  Noting difficulties in 
scheduling, attendance, and overall coordination with the National 
Congress Party (NCP) and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement 
(SPLM), Vraalsen questioned the commitment of these parties to the 
AEC.  These comments elicited a quick response from the NCP and 
SPLM, as well as competing views on the Blue Nile province, the 
release of funding for the ongoing census, and security in Khartoum 
and the south. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  The AEC meeting was attended by representatives from Italy, NCP, 
the Netherlands, Norway, SPLM, U.K., U.S., and observers from the EU 
and the U.N.  Chairman Vraalsen delivered a detailed report of his 
May travel throughout Sudan.  Focusing much attention on the Blue 
Nile, chairman Vraalsen stated that there is a "sharp delineation" 
between SPLM and GNU controlled areas.  According to Blue Nile 
officials, the Government of National Unity (GNU) has not delivered 
funds to this state, leading to continued difficulties for the 
development of education sector, joint integrated units (JIU), and 
continued disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) 
efforts.  On his visit to Juba (May 1-3), Vraalsen found the city 
"booming with construction and trade."  According to his report, the 
WFP program, road construction, and the de-mining activities are all 
thriving. He also noted that AEC's new facility in Juba should be 
operational by August 2007.  Vraalsen stated that he understands 
funds from the 2007 budget for the census have not been disbursed. 
Chairman Vraalsen ended his comments urging the NCP and SPLM to take 
their commitment to the AEC more seriously, saying, "I expect full 
cooperation [from the SPLM and NCP.]  We cannot continue going down 
this road." 
 
¶3. The NCP representatives, Idris Muhammad Abd Al-Qadar and Abdel 
Rahman Ibrahim El Khalifa, responded to Vraalsen's comments, stating 
that their commitment to the AEC should not be questioned, calling 
his remarks "unfortunate."  Al-Qadar objected to Vraalsen's bleak 
picture of the Blue Nile state and added that the funds for the 
census from the 2006 budget have been paid in full and that the 2007 
portion will be made through a quarterly allocation. 
 
¶4.  The SPLM representatives, Angelina Teny, Anne Itto, and  Kosti 
Manibe, praised Chairman Vraalsen's report on his trip, urging 
similar AEC travel in the future.  State Minister Itto, while 
enthusiastic about Juba's development, cautioned that Juba should 
not become the focus of all development in the south.  Itto warned 
that the center-periphery relationship between Khartoum and the rest 
of Sudan should not be replicated between Juba and the rural south. 
With regards to the census, Itto stated that quarterly funds should 
have arrived by March, but in fact had not been received by May. 
SPLM representatives painted a more sober picture of the Blue Nile 
state, naming corruption, the failure to pay salaries, and the lack 
of civil service infrastructure as significant problems. Teny also 
added that more work by the AEC is needed on two topics: the oil 
sector and Abyei.  She expressed concern about reports of attacks on 
southerners in Khartoum. 
 
¶5.  SPLM and NCP representatives assured Charge Powers that they 
would send a representative to the Wealth Sharing Working Group's 
visit to the Heglig Oil field on May 21, 2007.  The next AEC Plenary 
will be held June 7th, 2007. 
 
¶6.  The draft minutes from the May 15 AEC plenary meeting will be 
emailed to SPG.
