Â¶1. (SBU) We shared Ref A World Health Assembly message on pandemic 
influenza preparedness with Russian Government officials at the 
MFA's International Organizations Department, the Health and Social 
Development Ministry's International Department (MOHSD), and the 
International Department of the Federal Surveillance Service for 
Consumer Rights Protection and Human Well-Being (Rospotrebnadzor). 
Senior Counselor Nikita Sikachov in the MFA's International 
Department and Yevgeniy Slastnikh from the MOHSD both told us they 
welcomed receiving the U.S. views on pandemic flu preparedness, but 
offered no substantive response.  (NOTE:  We reported separately in 
Ref B on Russian views regarding smallpox. END NOTE)
