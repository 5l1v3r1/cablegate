Territories (5/22) 
 
¶1.  Summary:  Syrian papers on May 22 continued to report on clashes 
in Naher al-Bared refugee camp in north Lebanon. 
 
All papers also featured a lecture at Damascus University by FM 
Mouallem on May 21 praising Syria's foreign policy under President 
Asad's leadership, saying that "US pressures and attempts to isolate 
Syria, since the occupation of Iraq, have failed, thanks to the 
national cohesion in Syria and the people's support of their 
Leader."  He emphasized that dialogue with the US must cover 
regional issues in order to achieve security and stability here. 
 
On the peace process, the Minister stressed that Israel has no 
desire for peace, and that "the liberation of the Golan remains at 
the top of Syria's defense and political priorities." 
 
Regarding Iraq, the Foreign Minister said the solution has to be 
political, must preserve the country's territorial integrity and 
independence, and must set a timetable for withdrawal of foreign 
troops. 
 
On the Palestinian issue, the Minister reiterated Syria's continuous 
efforts to stop Palestinian civil strife. 
 
As for Lebanon, Mouallem renewed Syria's support for what the 
Lebanese agree upon, pointing out the importance of Lebanon's 
stability and security for Syria, and saying that "the only way to 
achieve this goal is through Lebanese national dialogue and 
formation of a national government."  On the international tribunal, 
the Minister said "the aim of this tribunal under Chapter 7 is to 
subjugate every country that opposes US hegemony."  Regarding the 
latest events in Lebanon, FM Mouallem made it clear that the 
so-called "Fatah al-Islam" is an outlawed group whose militants are 
pursued in Syria and whose activities do not serve the Palestinian 
cause. 
 
Independent al-Watan cited a statement by Bashar al-Jaafari, Syria's 
Ambassador to the UN, denying any Syrian linkage with Fatah al-Islam 
and linking violence in Lebanon to the UN Security Council vote on 
the International Tribunal.  Al-Jafaari said that "every time the UN 
Security Council is scheduled to meet to deal with the Lebanon 
crisis, there is some kind of trouble, like a bombing, assassination 
or assassination attempt one or two days earlier."  He added that 
"some people are trying to pressure the UNSC members to adopt the 
US-British-French draft resolution on the International Tribunal." 
 
 
End of summary.

¶3.  Editorial Block Quotes: 
 
------------------------ 
 
"Horizons of US Dispute" 
 
------------------------ 
 
Muhammad Khair al-Jammali, an editorialist in government-owned 
Al-Thawra, wrote (5/22):  "The debate between Democrats and 
Republicans, which at the beginning was aimed at correcting mistakes 
of the current US Administration and reformulating America's 
relations with the world and the Middle East free from the logic of 
force and the policy of threats, has now turned into merely an 
electoral battle in preparation for the presidential election, which 
will be held more than two years from now.  This makes this debate 
useless as far as the situation in Iraq and the American predicament 
in that country are concerned.... 
 
"For this debate to open onto positive horizons accelerating the end 
of the American occupation of Iraq and helping the United States 
come out of its crisis and its successive repercussions there, 
Iraqis have no option but to continue with their resistance and to 
increase the losses among occupation soldiers.... Americans have no 
option but to expose the policy of lies that their administration is 
pursuing and on which it built the failed war plan in Iraq, and to 
remove President Bush before he completes his term in office in 
light of the damage and harm his policy has caused to the interests, 
economy, reputation, and credibility of the United States...." 
 
------------------------ 
 
"They Are Not Regretful" 
 
------------------------ 
 
As'ad Abbud, a columnist in government-owned Al-Thawra, wrote 
(5/22):  "During his last visit to Baghdad, British Prime Minister 
Tony Blair said that he did not regret the war on Iraq.... 
 
"Instead of offering an expression of sorrow, a small apology, or a 
tear for those who are killed daily in Iraq, Blair announced in 
Baghdad that he does not regret participating in the major 
historical crime of invading Iraq.... 
 
"Mr. Blair, we did not expect you to express regret.  If there were 
any capacity for you to regret, you would not have committed what 
you have committed.  The crime of destroying Iraq was committed in 
cold blood.  Maybe you did not draw up its scenes, but you were 
certainly an accomplice.  Your regret will not do you any good 
before history.... It has already damned those who destroyed this 
country with gunpowder, fire, and hatred, hatred toward Arab 
history, Arab civilization, and Arabs and Muslims...."
