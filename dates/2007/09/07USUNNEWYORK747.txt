¶1. (U) SUMMARY: SYG Ban Ki-Moon briefed the UNSC September 12 
on his recent travels to Sudan, Chad and Libya and provided 
an update on UNAMID deployment.  SYG Ban asked for UNSC 
members to support the planned meeting between the Government 
of National Unity (GNU) and the Darfur rebel groups to be 
convened in Tripoli on October 27.  In regard to UNAMID 
implementation, SYG Ban asked the UNSC to assist DPKO with 
attaining pledges of specialized military units, specifically 
transport and aviation assets.  Delegations praised SYG Ban's 
efforts to find a diplomatic resolution to the crisis, voiced 
frustration with the escalating violence in Darfur and asked 
the UN to move forward quickly with full implementation of 
UNAMID.  END SUMMARY.

SYG Ban Calls on UNSC to Support 
POL Process, UNAMID Deployment 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) In closed UNSC consultations on September 12, SYG Ban 
reported that he held a series of productive meetings with 
Sudanese President Bashir, Chadian President Idriss Deby and 
Libyan President Qaddafi during his September visit to the 
region.  SYG Ban called on the international community to 
support the UN/AU political process and asked UNSC members to 
encourage rebel leaders to attend the October 27 UN/AU 
brokered Darfur peace talks in Tripoli (ref A).  SYG Ban 
reported that he had been warmly received throughout the 
region and said that political momentum is building for the 
October 27 meeting in Tripoli between the GNU and Darfur 
rebel groups, but acknowledged that ongoing rebel attacks and 
SAF aerial bombings threatened to derail it.  SYG Ban asked 
UNSC members to use their influence with rebel groups and the 
GNU to attain a cessation of hostilities.  SYG Ban said he 
had asked President Bashir to "exercise maximum restraint" 
and reported that Bashir had responded positively. 
 
¶3. (U) In regard to UNAMID implementation, SYG Ban said DPKO 
has made substantial progress on addressing troop 
contributions of light infantry, but lacked substantial 
support from TCCs to meet UNAMID requirements for specialized 
and mechanized units.  (NOTE: DPKO provided a September 10 
briefing on UNAMID shortfalls to be reported septel.  END 
NOTE.)  SYG Ban said that many of these specialized assets 
would have to come from "non-African countries" and asked 
UNSC members to assist DPKO with attaining the required 
contributions.

POL Process, Darfur Violence

¶4. (U) AMB Khalilzad delivered reftel talking points, 
highlighting USG support for the UN/AU political process (ref 
B).  He added that all players in the Darfur conflict must be 
appropriately represented and that Sudan Liberation Movement 
faction leader Abdelwahid al-Nur must be pressed to attend. 
In regard to the venue, AMB Khalilzad welcomed Libya's 
willingness to host the October 27 meeting and stressed that 
the UN must maintain control over the arrangements so that 
discussions can unfold in a neutral, positive atmosphere. 
AMB Khalilzad added that a cessation of hostilities by all 
parties in Darfur would contribute to the success of the 
October 27 discussions. 
 
¶5. (U) Delegations broadly echoed calls for a cessation of 
hostilities in the lead up to the Tripoli meetings and called 
for rapid UNAMID implementation.  UNSC members agreed that 
all rebel factions must be appropriately represented.  PRC PR 
Wang said that the UNSC must send a "unified message" on 
Darfur in the lead up to the Tripoli discussions and asked 
that "those with particular influence over the Darfur rebel 
groups" encourage full participation in the meeting.  French 
PR Ripert said the pending Chad/CAR draft resolution would 
complement UNAMID implementation and asked the UNSC to move 
forward quickly with the negotiating process.  Italian PR 
Spatafora said that Sudanese President Bashir is slated to 
visit Rome next week and promised that the Government of 
Italy would ensure that its message tracked with the SYG's 
efforts.
