¶1. (S) German MFA Export Control Division Desk Officer Wiebke 
Wacker delivered a German-language nonpaper to Global Affairs 
officer September 19.  The nonpaper responds to ref B 
demarche informing German authorities that the German firm 
Trumpf GmbH & Co., working with Ireland's Mac Aviation Group, 
offered a model TLC-1005 five-axis laser cutting and welding 
machine to Iran's Ariasa AG.  Wacker said officials from the 
German Federal Office of Economics and Export Controls (BAFA) 
had sensitized Trumpf representatives to the case.  She 
stated the firm subsequently stopped processing the order. 
 
¶2. (S) Begin text of informal Embassy translation of German 
nonpaper: 
 
With reference to your nonpaper of July 19, 2007 concerning 
the export of a five-axis laser cutting and welding machine 
by the German firm Trumpf from Germany via Ireland and 
Malaysia to Iran, we take this opportunity to bring the 
following information to the attention of the U.S. 
authorities: 
 
-- We thank you for the information in connection with the 
proposed delivery of a welding machine by the German firm 
Trumpf via Ireland and Malaysia to the Iranian firm Ariasa AG. 
 
-- The Trumpf firm was sensitized by BAFA officials.  The 
firm confirmed the existence of a related inquiry, which came 
from the firm IIT Trading Group, probably acting on behalf of 
Mac Aviation Group.  The inquiry was presented to TGB, an 
Irish subsidiary of Trumpf.  According to information 
provided to Trumpf, the machine was intended for use by Mac 
Aviation in Malaysia. 
 
-- German authorities' communication and contact records 
indicate that the Trumpf firm has not to date communicated 
with Iranian entities. 
 
-- Trumpf has stopped processing the order and assured BAFA 
it will apply for an export license in the event the firm 
pursues the matter further. 
 
We look forward to continuing our excellent cooperation in 
the field of export controls.
