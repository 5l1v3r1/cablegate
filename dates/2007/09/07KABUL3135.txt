SUBJECT: HELMAND PROVINCE - POPPY ERADICATION FORCE'S PRE-PLANTING 
CAMPAIGN HAS GOOD START 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  The Poppy Eradication Force (PEF) conducted a 
pre-planting outreach campaign in Helmand Province from August 29 
through September 5, 2007.  The PEF organized two well-attended 
Shuras with area elders and met with numerous farmers in the 
Lashkargah area.  No security incidents occurred, and the PEF team 
was well received by Helmand residents.  Farmers expressed support 
of the outreach effort but said they were disappointed with GoA 
efforts to support alternative agriculture programs and with the 
slow pace of development in Lashkargah.  END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------------------- 
PEF Campaign Off to a Good Start 
-------------------------------- 
¶2. (SBU) The PEF conducted a pre-planting outreach campaign in 
Helmand province from August 29 through September 5.  The PEF 
Commander, General Ahmad Zai, delivered a consistent message at two 
large Shuras attended by hundreds of Helmand residents: the PEF 
would conduct a poppy eradication campaign in Helmand Province, and 
Helmand farmers must stop poppy cultivation and move to alternative 
agriculture production.  The Deputy Governor, Haji Pir Mohammad, and 
Helmand Chief of Police General Andiwol delivered strong 
counternarcotics (CN) messages to support the PEF, telling shura 
attendees that increased poppy production contributed to the 
instability in Helmand and that further development was unlikely 
without a reduction in poppy production.

Helmand Residents Respond 
------------------------- 
¶3. (SBU) Residents welcomed the chance to discuss the issue with GoA 
authorities.  Some attendees expressed anger at the GoA for its 
failure to deliver on previous promises and said they were 
disappointed at the slow pace of development in Helmand.  Many 
admitted the choice to grow poppy was simply about earning more 
money for their crops and said they were unwilling to stop planting 
poppy until either the GoA or the international community provided 
significant subsidies to grow alternative agriculture.  Some of the 
most vocal elders accused the GoA of collusion with the 
narco-traffickers and said that poppy production would not decrease 
in Helmand until the central government fulfilled previous promises. 
 The crowd applauded the comments against the central government and 
supported calls for greater assistance from the GoA.

Comment 
------- 
¶4. (SBU) The PEF pre-planting public outreach operation in Helmand 
was well-organized, and coordination between PEF and the PRT was 
very good.  Hundreds of area residents attended the public forums 
and engaged the PEF in lively debates about current operations and 
previous GoA efforts.  This pre-planting outreach effort put 
hundreds of Helmand farmers on notice that eradication forces will 
be back in 2007-08, which could increase the risk of growing poppy 
and might move some farmers towards alternative agriculture 
production.  However, many Helmand farmers are clearly frustrated at 
the GoA and want significant development and agricultural support 
before they halt poppy production. 
END COMMENT.
