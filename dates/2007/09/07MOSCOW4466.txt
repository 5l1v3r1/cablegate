Per Ref A request, we have identified two Russian radiation medicine 
experts who could participate in a dialogue with U.S. experts and 
travel to the United States in October or November for further 
consultations.  The Russian experts are Dr. Andrey Bushmanov, 
Director of the Clinical Radiation Medicine Department of the 
Russian Institute of Biophysics, and Dr. Valeriy Krasnyuk, the head 
of the Internal Contamination Medical Division at the Institute of 
Biophysics.  We have shared the Russian doctors' resumes and a list 
of their scholarly articles with OES/IHA by e-mail (Ref B).  The 
Russian experts have requested a formal written invitation from the 
USG (preferably from the Department of Health and Human Services) in 
order to receive supervisory approval for their travel from the 
Russian Federal Medical Biological Agency and the International 
Department of the Health and Social Development Ministry.
