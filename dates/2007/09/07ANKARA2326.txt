Police Foil Bomb Attack in Ankara on 9/11 Anniversary 
All papers report the discovery by the police of an explosives-laden 
van in a parking lot in downtown Ankara has thwarted a "September 11 
plot."  "A catastrophe has been averted," Ankara governor Kemal Onal 
said after police defused the mechanism of about 300 kg of 
explosives. The parking lot is located in a busy neighborhood with 
thousands of homes and businesses in the surrounding area.  Onal's 
office said explosives found in the minibus were similar to those 
used by the PKK.  Several papers, however, believe al-Qaeda is 
another probable perpetrator.  Mainstream Sabah asks whether it was 
a "coincidence" that Osama bin-Laden mentioned Ankara in connection 
with a historical event in a tape released recently.  Papers also 
speculate probable targets were the US Embassy, the Parliament, and 
ministry buildings. 
 
Editorial Commentary on 9/11 Anniversary 
Nagehan Alci writes in the tabloid Aksam: "On the sixth anniversary, 
the painful memories of the victims are no longer the only issue 
related to the 9/11 attacks.  We also feel sorry for the new victims 
who lost their lives because of vengeance and a vindictive attitude. 
 The US used the attacks of 9/11 as an excuse to act like the 
sheriff for the whole world.  Looking at the events of the recent 
past, it seems the nature of power of the US administration changed 
significantly since September 11, 2001.  Security has become the 
prevailing principle for everything -- a policy that led to 
continuous secrecy in government affairs.  The US is rapidly losing 
its identity as an open society.  In short, the US administration 
has been in a war situation for the last 6 years.  And the US 
administration is functioning under rigid secrecy.  More secrecy 
means less democracy.  Given the current psychology in Washington, 
there is growing speculation that the Pentagon is planning for an 
attack against Iran.  That means new victims and new battlefields 
are on the horizon.  It only looks like a remake of the same 
movie." 
 
Embassy Ankara Denies Reports Claiming US Ties with the PKK 
Hurriyet, Vatan, Yeni Safak, Cumhuriyet, Zaman, and Yeni Safak 
report on US Embassy Ankara's response to the claims put forth by 
the British Daily Telegraph that the US supports and maintains 
contact with the PKK.  Papers cite a statement released by the 
embassy saying, "The US does not support the PKK in any way. 
Reports to the contrary are fabrications and have no basis in fact. 
They are designed to drive a wedge between two allies, the United 
States and Turkey."  Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak says the DT story 
claiming armored vehicles were seen in Mount Kandil heightened 
concerns that private security contractors are backing the terrorist 
organization. 
 
Demonstrations across Turkey against 1980 Military Coup 
All papers report protest demonstrations will be staged in Ankara 
and other major Turkish cities to mark the 27th anniversary of the 
September 12, 1980, military takeover.  The demonstrators will 
reportedly rally in front of the US Embassy in Ankara. 
Opposition CHP leader Deniz Baykal said ahead of the anniversary on 
Wednesday, "Today democracy and our republic have problems but a 
military coup can never be a solution". 
 
Iraq Rejects Turkey's Proposal for Cooperation against PKK 
Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet reports that speaking to CNN Turk in 
Baghdad, Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari blamed Turkey for the 
failure of his country to undertake concrete steps against the PKK. 
Zebari complained that Ankara wanted to exclude the Kurdish 
Administration in Northern Iraq from the talks with Baghdad and that 
is why they did not sign the memorandum of understanding for 
cooperation against the PKK drafted during Iraqi PM Maliki's recent 
visit to Turkey. 
 
US Ambassador Visits Kocatepe Mosque 
 
ANKARA 00002326  002 OF 002 
 
 
Islamist oriented Yeni Safak reported that Ambassador Wilson paid a 
"surprise visit" to Kocatepe Mosque in Ankara yesterday and met with 
chief Imam Ismail Cosar for one hour.  Imam Cosar said in answer to 
reporters' questions about the visit "we chatted with the Ambassador 
and had tea.  The Ambassador asked a few questions about the mosque 
and the difference in the capacity of the mosque during Ramadan." 
Conservative Bugun carried the same story under the headline "Why 
did the US Ambassador Visit the Mosque?" 
 
Secretary Rice to Attend Iraq's Neighbors Conference in Istanbul 
 
SIPDIS 
Hurriyet, Cumhuriyet:  Speaking to press, State Department Spokesman 
Sean McCormack said that Secretary Rice is planning to attend the 
Iraq Neighbors conference in October in Istanbul.  Although no 
appointments are set yet, the Secretary might have meetings with 
Iranian and Syrian Foreign Ministers, McCormack added.
