¶1. (SBU) On September 2-5, Embassy Cairo sponsored a four-day 
workshop for twenty-four Egyptian National Police (ENP) 
Generals and other senior police officials.  This Senior 
Leadership Workshop is part of the larger USG-Egyptian Police 
project funded by the USG and sub-contracted by State-INL to 
Bearing Point (BE) and The Emergence Group (TEG). 
 
¶2. (SBU) The topics covered over the course of the workshop 
were: 1) public image and perception, 2) police and the 
media, 3) police misconduct, 4) policy and procedure, 5) 
strategic planning overview, 6) managing change, and 7) 
management strategies. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Following the workshop participants proposed several 
activities and initiatives that they believed would benefit 
them in the future. One of the topics that generated a great 
deal of discussion related to the development of good leaders 
and managers and the distinction between them both. There was 
also substantial interest in knowing more about the American 
system of law enforcement. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In response, the BE/TEG team will prepare a 1-2 page 
brief on the American Policing System which will be 
translated and distributed to participants at a future date. 
This brief will be used in all future USG-ENP Project 
initiatives as a participant handout. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: The ENP officials were highly receptive to 
the workshop and actively engaged in all learning activities. 
A solid relationship was established with many opportunities 
for follow up as the participants proposed the idea of a 
series of ongoing seminars or workshops focused on 
contemporary law enforcement topics.
