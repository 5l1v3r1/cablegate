(SBU)  DG for the Middle East, Mediterranean and Africa 
Alvaro Iranzo told the DCM September 13 that Spain remains 
committed to a contribution to the MFO this year, but he 
cautioned that budgetary constraints would likely limit the 
size of the contribution.  He and his Deputy DG for the 
Middle East Alberto Ucelay expressed their opinion that Spain 
would likely only be able to contribute approximately 
USD120,000 to pay for one FAV.  Poloff asked Ucelay 
separately whether the GOS would welcome a visit by MFO 
Director General James Larocco, to which Ucelay replied 
"absolutely" and suggested that such a visit might help shake 
loose some funds.
