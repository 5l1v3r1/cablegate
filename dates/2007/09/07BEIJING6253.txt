SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) A September 2007 forum on economic cooperation 
among members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) 
had far fewer and lower ranking speakers than the previous 
year.  The SCO Secretary General highlighted China's 
leading role in deepening friendship, cooperation and 
mutual economic relationships among the SCO countries while 
reviewing recent agreements signed by SCO members as well 
as new relationships established with multilateral 
organizations.  The World Economic Forum's "Davos to 
Dalian" meeting held several days after the Urumqi 
conference may have drawn a number of participants away 
from this year's seminar.  End Summary.

WEAKER CONFERENCE ATTENDANCE, LOWER RANKING OFFICIALS 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶2. (SBU)  The "Seminar on SCO National Priority Areas of 
Cooperation" forum on regional economic cooperation held in 
Urumqi from August 31 - September 2, 2007, had fewer 
speeches (one three-hour session versus three sessions 
lasting a total of eight hours in 2006) and lower-ranked 
representation (Directors and Deputy Directors rather than 
a former Prime Minister and several Ministers and Vice 
Ministers).  Afghanistan was absent altogether as was 
diplomatic representation of SCO member countries aside 
from the Minister Counselor of the Tajik Embassy in China. 
The forum has in the past provided a unique window into the 
SCO economic agenda (see reftel). 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
LEGAL FRAMEWORK SET, IMPLEMENTATION PHASE REACHED 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶3. (SBU)  SCO Secretary General Nurgaliyev used his speech 
to review the recent signing by the SCO's six countries of 
the "Long-term Good Neighborhood Friendship Cooperation 
Treaty" at the August 2007 SCO Summit held in Bishek.  This 
treaty covers the protection of property rights, facilities 
for trade development, investment promotion, technical 
exchanges, and the protection of the legal rights of 
individuals engaging in economic activity within the SCO 
region. 
 
¶4. (SBU)  Nurgaliyev said that leaders of SCO member 
countries at the Bishkek Summit agreed that the 
"implementation phase" of the SCO economic agenda had been 
reached.  This includes agreement on "demonstration 
projects" with multilateral participation in energy, 
transportation and telecommunications.  Nurgaliyev did not 
specify any specific initiatives or funding amounts for 
such projects.  His speech also highlighted the "good 
prospects" for cooperation with partner countries India, 
Pakistan, Iran, Mongolia, and Afghanistan.

REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC COOPERATION 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶5. (SBU)  Nurgaliyev highlighted the SCO's relations with 
seven multilateral organizations including the Community of 
Independent States, United Nations Development Program, 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, 
ASEAN, Asian Development Bank, and the United Nations 
Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific.

He also mentioned Asian Development Bank and UN funding of 
joint road development and noted without elaboration his 
"great hope" for the work of the SCO Bank Community and 
Businessmen Committee. 
 
------------------------------------- 
FOCUS ON BILATERAL ECONOMIC RELATIONS 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU)  No major SCO-sponsored economic projects were 
announced at this year's forum, and speeches tended to 
emphasize bilateral relations with China, with scant 
mention of SCO-based initiatives.  M.H. Biyaluofu, Deputy 
Director of the Kazakhstan Chamber of Industry and Commerce 
made passing reference to the signing of a series of 
bilateral agreements between China and Kazakhstan at the 
Bishek Summit.  The Director of the Uzbekistan Foreign 
Investment Information Security and Promotion Office made 
no reference at all to the SCO during his speech.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶7. (SBU)  While trade between China and Central Asia 
continues to rise, there is no sign that the SCO framework 
is part of this trend.  The SCO has proven a venue for 
signing numerous bilateral economic agreements, but there 
has so far been no sign that the forum is lending itself to 
economic initiatives that actually promote regional 
economic integration.
