Reaction to Abe's Resignation 
----------------------------- 
 
¶2.  At the September 13 regular MFA press briefing, 
Spokeswoman Jiang Yu said Japanese PM Abe's resignation was 
an internal affair of Japan.  China attaches "great 
importance" to the steady development of ties, she stated. 
At present, China and Japan are building mutual trust.  Jiang 
declined to speculate on a possible China visit for the new 
Japanese prime minister.  She stated that China and Japan 
"will have positive consultations on the issue." 
 
A New Prime Minister in Moscow 
------------------------------ 
 
¶3.  The selection of a new prime minister in Russia is an 
internal affair of that country, Jiang said.  The two 
countries cooperate in the areas of politics, economics, 
trade, science and technology.  Sino-Russian relations are 
characterized by a "strategic cooperative partnership," she 
said. 
 
PDAS Christensen's Speech and U.S. Taiwan Policy 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶4.  When asked to comment on PDAS Tom Christensen's September 
11 speech on Taiwan, Jiang relayed that the United States has 
said it would stick to its one China policy in line with the 
three joint communiques to oppose Taiwan's efforts at a 
referendum.  She stated her hope that the United States will 
abide by the communiques and help China make "joint efforts" 
to ensure cross-Strait stability.  Jiang reiterated China's 
position on Taiwan and said that the Taiwan authorities are 
making efforts to split the motherland.  These are "doomed to 
failure," she stated. 
 
New Vice Foreign Minister, Ambassador to Japan? 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶5.  In response to a question asking for confirmation 
regarding Ambassador to Japan Wang Yi becoming Vice FM and 
Cui Tiankai becoming the next Ambassador to Japan, Jiang said 
an announcement would be made in due course. 
 
No Date Set for Six-Party Talks 
------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  When asked for details about the upcoming Six-Party 
Talks, Jiang replied that no date has yet been decided upon, 
but the Chinese government will announce a date as soon as it 
has been agreed upon. 
 
Iran's Interior Minister Visiting China 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  Iran's Interior Minister is visiting China today and 
tomorrow.  He will meet with MFA officials and exchange views 
on Sino-Iranian relations.  China welcomes the Iran-IAEA 
action plan and is satisfied with Iran's recent efforts to 
cooperate with IAEA investigations.  Continued negotiation is 
the best way forward in this matter. 
 
Earthquake in Indonesia 
----------------------- 
 
¶8.  Asked for comment on China's reaction and possible aid 
regarding Indonesia's earthquake, Jiang expressed her 
sympathy and said she hopes the Indonesian people will 
overcome their difficulties to rebuild their homeland.
