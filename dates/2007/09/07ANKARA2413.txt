SUBJECT: Update on PKK Violence (September 16-23, 2007) 
 
REF: ANKARA 2367 and previous 
 
(U) Sensitive but unclassified - please protect accordingly. 
 
¶1. (SBU) This is another in a series of periodic reports on PKK 
violence in Turkey.  Our primary sources for these reports are 
mainstream Turkish press services, such as the Anatolian News 
Agency, and international wire services.  While these are more 
reliable than most Turkish press sources, they are not necessarily 
unimpeachable.  A major source is the Turkish General Staff (TGS) 
website which documents contacts/clashes with the PKK.  Press 
services sympathetic to the PKK, such as Neu-Isenburg People's 
Defense Forces and Firat News Agency, tend to report higher numbers 
of the Turkish Security Forces casualties and are often otherwise 
unreliable. 
 
¶2. (U) During the September 16-23, 2007 reporting period, one GOT 
security official was killed in a clash with the PKK and five more 
were injured, including four in explosions. 
 
¶3. (U) In the same period, 21 PKK terrorists were killed in clashes, 
while five PKKers were captured. 
 
¶4. (U) The TGS website reported 13 clashes between security forces 
and PKK terrorists in Turkey's southeastern region during the 
reporting period.  Security forces discovered at least 60 PKK 
shelters/caves/caches and seized booby-trapped land mines; other 
explosives, including A-4 and TNT; Kalashnikov rifles; cartridges; 
hand grenades; pistols; night vision binoculars; TV sets; satellite 
antennas; and radios. 
 
¶5. (U) During the reporting period, security forces reportedly 
discovered approximately 12 separate explosive devices planted by 
the PKK in the region.  Most were destroyed in controlled 
detonations before they could be detonated by terrorists. 
 
¶6. (U) On September 18, PKK terrorists stopped a civilian car in 
Semdinli, Hakkari province, which belonged to a company that 
provides supplies to military installations in the southeast. 
Terrorists planted a bomb in the vehicle, unbeknownst to the driver. 
 TGS officials believe the bomb exploded early, killing the civilian 
driver and surmise that the actual target of the device was a 
military installation.
