¶1. Summary: A Ukrainian record company won a court case on September 
13 against the infamous Ukrainian music download site mp3.ua.  To 
our knowledge, it is the first time a music company has successfully 
won a civil case against an online music pirate in a Ukrainian 
court.  The court ruling imposes substantive penalties on mp3.ua. 
The ruling came as a surprise, as law enforcement officials and many 
industry reps did not believe the courts would take action against 
download sites.  Police have instead been trying to work through the 
Internet Service Providers (ISPs).  Although the owners of the site 
will likely appeal the decision, the court's decision could set an 
important precedent for industry to defend its rights in court, and 
it validates recent USG efforts to provide IPR training to the 
courts.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. The aptly-named Ukrainian record company Honest Music won a 
landmark court case on September 13 against internet site 
www.mp3.ua, considered the largest Ukrainian source of pirated music 
online.  The ruling by Ukraine's High Commercial Court imposes the 
following penalties on mp3.ua: 
 
-- To stop offering all the tracks from Honest Music's catalogue for 
downloading; 
 
-- To pay almost USD 75,000 in damages to Honest Music; and 
 
-- To pay a fine of USD 7,500 to the State Budget of Ukraine. 
 
(Note: A representative of Honest Music informed us that a copy of 
the court decision is not yet publicly available but promised to 
provide one when possible.  End Note.) 
 
¶3. Ignat Berezhny, head of the Ukrainian Music Industry Association, 
an IFPI-affiliated umbrella organization that includes Honest Music 
as well as most large international labels, cautioned Econoff on 
September 14 that he expected mp3.ua to appeal the decision.  Should 
Honest Music win the appeal, however, industry will then seek to use 
the case as a precedent to broaden the action against mp3.ua to 
include other rights holders, said Berezhny. 
 
¶4. Econoff had discussed GOU efforts to combat internet piracy with 
Serhiy Lebid, head of the Ministry of Interior's IPR Department, on 
August 29, before the court ruling.  Lebid restated that the GOU's 
preferred method to shut down illegal sites was to work through 
Internet Service Providers (ISPs), as he felt law enforcement lacked 
the necessary authority to go through the courts (refs A and D). 
Private sector companies have been equally doubtful of their chances 
of success against online pirates in Ukraine's civil courts. 
Econoff passed to Lebid ISP information from USG agencies and 
industry on mp3.ua and mp3stor.com, another suspected Ukrainian 
pirate site.  (Note: Post also passed this information to Embassy 
Moscow, as experts believe the servers hosting mp3.ua are located in 
Russia.  End note.)  Lebid appreciated the information and promised 
a thorough investigation of both sites. 
 
Comment: An Anti-Piracy Turning Point? 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. This court decision, if held up on appeal, could mark a major 
turning point in the fight against online piracy in Ukraine.  Mp3.ua 
has built up a huge repertoire of nearly 32,000 artists, developed a 
large Ukrainian user base, and seemed able to operate with impunity. 
 Ministry of Interior efforts to shut down the site appeared to be 
going slowly, and the courts appeared unable to act.  The High 
Commercial Court's ruling may finally set the precedent for rights 
holders to successfully use Ukrainian courts to defend their IP 
rights from illegal online use.  It also validates our recent 
efforts to expand USG-sponsored IPR training for Ukrainian courts, 
and the High Commercial Court in particular (refs B-C).
