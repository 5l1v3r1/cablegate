IAEA BOARD OF GOVERNORS MEETING

¶1. (SBU) Poloffs delivered reftel demarches on September 10 
to the Foreign Secretariat's (SRE's) Deputy Director General 
for UN-Related Security and Legal Issues Julian Juarez 
Cardenas.  Juarez noted U.S. views and reiterated Mexico's 
policy with regard to the Iran issue: The GOM respects each 
country's right to develop a peaceful nuclear program, agrees 
that Iran needs to meet its international obligations as 
articulated in UNSC resolutions, and favors treatment of this 
matter within the IAEA framework.  Mexico views the key 
problem as Iran's lack of transparency.  Mexico will not 
offer an intervention on this issue this week since it is not 
presently on the IAEA Board and its new ambassador is not yet 
accredited. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Polcouns further raised this issue with Ambassador 
Pablo Macedo Riba, SRE's new Director General for UN-Related 
Security and Legal Issues.  (Note: former Director General 
Ulises Canchola has become Mexico's Deputy Representative to 
the UN in Vienna.  End note.)  Macedo took on board U.S. 
concerns but offered no further comments.
