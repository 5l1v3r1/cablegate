¶1. (SBU) In a September 21 meeting with Congenoff, Vice Director 
Chen Heqing of the Guangdong Province Department of Agriculture's 
Division of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Economy said there are no 
plans to cull additional fowl after the recent avian influenza 
outbreak in Guangzhou's Panyu District.  He also explained that the 
suspension of area poultry markets applied only the suspension of 
sales of local meat. Outside poultry and fowl have been delivered to 
the area to meet local food demand and maintain social stability. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Chen said that an increased number of migratory birds are 
expected to arrive in South China in the coming months, raising the 
risk of additional outbreaks. He stated that a surveillance and 
monitoring network had been established to address this increased 
risk.
