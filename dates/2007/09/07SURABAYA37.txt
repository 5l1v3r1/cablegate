¶1.  (SBU) Sofian Hadi, Director of Operations for the Sidoarjo 
Mud Management Agency (BPLS), told Consulate Surabaya September 
18 that hydrogen sulfide gas levels at the mud flow site in 
Sidoarjo had increased to 30 -- 35 ppm (parts per million), 
levels considered dangerous to human health. It has since fallen 
to 21 ppm.  Soffian explained that "healthy" levels are below 20 
ppm.  BPLS spokesman Ahmad Zulkarnaen told the press that BPLS 
had been forced to evacuate workers when the gas levels spiked 
last week.  A four-member medical team operating out of an 
ambulance at the site told visiting Foreign Area Officer in late 
August that they were seeing an average of 10 patients per day, 
mostly for respiratory complaints caused by mud flow gases. 
Sofian told us that he was called to Jakarta this week for talks 
with the Ministry of Public Works and Parliament about current 
conditions at the disaster site. 
 
Porong River Level Rising as Sedimentation Increases 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Sofian said mud sedimentation in the nearby Porong 
River is now a critical concern.  According to Sofian, BPLS's 
strategy of pushing mud into the Porong river has deposited 2.5 
meters of solid sedimentation on to the river bottom, causing 
the water level to rise upriver and slowing the river's flow 
rate to only 3 cubic meters per second as compared to 1,000 -- 
1,500 cubic meters per second during the rainy season.  Rainy 
season demands on the river's banks at current sedimentation 
levels have yet to be tested and experts are predicting the 
water levels will exceed the height of existing river banks 
flooding villages and agricultural land.  To forestall flooding, 
BPLS plans to install an additional dredger to clear this mud 
and push the mud east toward the sea. Sofian said the dredgers 
will be operational within the next two weeks.  BPLS does not 
yet have any idea about the potential effectiveness of this plan 
and when results might be seen.  One skeptic, Nurul Ahdi, 
Secretary General of the Sidoarjo environment council, was 
 
SIPDIS 
quoted by Suara Surabaya Radio as saying that the dredgers will 
not be able to handle mud sedimentation in Porong River. 
 
Local Village Leader Holds Dyke Hostage 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  Local news reported today that head of the partially 
submerged village of Kedungbendo threatened to destroy a nearby 
dam if compensation payments were not released to him as 
promised. Many residents who qualify for compensation have seen 
delays in disbursement due red tape.
