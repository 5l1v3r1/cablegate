Accusations of Chinese Hacking "Groundless" 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  At the September 4 regular MFA press briefing, 
spokeswoman Jiang Yu called allegations that the Chinese 
military hacked into Pentagon computer systems "groundless" 
and representative of a "Cold War mentality."  Jiang said 
that hacking is a common activity of which China is also 
"frequently" victim. 
 
Steps to Increase Military Transparency at UN 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  The Chinese Government has decided to begin annual 
reporting to the United Nations on military spending and to 
resume participation in the UN Conventional Weapons Registry, 
Jiang told reporters.  Jiang added that the two measures 
further efforts toward military transparency, increase 
military trust with other countries and enhance international 
peace and stability. 
 
Chinese Weapons in Afghanistan 
------------------------------ 
 
¶4.  China holds a "prudent and responsible" attitude toward 
arms trading and follows its international obligations, UN 
Charter resolutions and domestic rules and regulations in 
this regard, stated Jiang when asked about an investigation 
into the use of Chinese weapons by the Taliban.  She 
reiterated China's three requirements that must be met before 
selling conventional weapons.  The buyer must clarify the 
"end user," weapons may not be sold to any third party and 
weapons may only be sold to governments, Jiang said. 
 
Special Representative Appointed for Climate Change 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶5.  Responding to a Xinhua News Agency reporter's question, 
Jiang confirmed the establishment of a special representative 
to international negotiations on climate change, which will 
work under the MFA's Department of Treaty and Law.  Yu 
Qingtai, who previously has served at the UN and as 
Ambassador to Tanzania, has been appointed as the new envoy. 
The establishment of the new position is an important step 
toward implementation of the Government's "national program" 
on climate change and demonstrates China's great attention to 
this issue and participation in this regard. 
 
Bush-Hu Meeting, Opposition to "Taiwan Independence" 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶6.  Asked if President Hu would raise Taiwan's referendum on 
UN membership with President Bush at their APEC meeting, 
Jiang reaffirmed that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China 
and the PRC Government is the only government that represents 
China.  Jiang expressed hope that the Bush-Hu meeting will 
benefit bilateral ties, adding that opposition to "Taiwan 
independence" will help safeguard peace and stability and 
also jointly benefit U.S.-China relations. 
 
China Supports DPRK Talks with U.S., Japan 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶7.  China welcomes the progress of recent United States-DPRK 
meetings in Geneva, supports the improvement of U.S.-DPRK 
 
BEIJING 00005792  002 OF 002 
 
 
relations and hopes the "relevant parties" can maintain the 
positive momentum as a basis for mutual trust and to promote 
the Six-Party Talks process.  China hopes Japan-DPRK meetings 
in Mongolia go "smoothly" and bring "great results," so that 
the two sides can solve issues at an early date.  Jiang told 
reporters no date had yet been set for the next phase of 
Six-Party Talks. 
 
Child Labor and Education, FM Yang to UK? 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶8.  Asked about reports that China's poor education system 
was contributing to the problem of child labor, the 
spokeswoman said China has all along respected the rights and 
interests of children and abides by conventions of the 
International Labor Organization (ILO).  Jiang had no 
information regarding a reporter's question on a possible 
visit to the UK by FM Yang.
