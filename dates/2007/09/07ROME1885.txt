¶1.  (U)  Sensitive But Unclassified.  Not for Internet 
Distribution. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Econoff and Econ Specialist delivered reftel 
information on recovery of debt owed the U.S. Export-Import 
Bank (Ex-Im Bank) by the Government of Zimbabwe (GOZ) to 
Michal Ron, Head of Claims and International Agreements for 
SACE, the Italian Export Credit Agency (ECA).  Ron was 
appreciative for reftel background on Ex-Im's recovery of the 
debt and, per reftel request, will follow-up directly with 
Ex-Im Bank's Assistant General Counsel. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) According to Ron, SACE is attempting to recover 
10.6 million dollars (principal and interest) owed SACE by 
the GOZ.  SACE's Board of Directors has authorized SACE to 
attempt recovery through litigation.  SACE is in the process 
of hiring a law firm to represent it in the litigation, and 
plans to bring suit against the GOZ in London or New York. 
Ron noted this is the first time SACE has sued a foreign 
sovereign government in its capacity as an ECA, and that the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Finance, which 
have seats on SACE's Board, will receive regular updates on 
SACE's recovery efforts.  SACE will also keep Paris Club 
members apprised. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Ron said that SACE will likely seek payment of the 
debt through attachment of assets in Italy and Great Britain 
owned by the GOZ.  This is similar to the strategy employed 
by the Dutch ECA in its efforts to secure repayment of debt 
owed by the GOZ.  SACE's decision to recover the debt owed it 
through attachment of GOZ assets also dictated the decision 
to file suit in New York or London -- Zimbabwean attorneys 
advised SACE that even if the Zimbabwean Courts ruled in 
SACE's favor, enforcement of the judgment would be near 
impossible in Zimbabwe.
