No Date Set for 6PT, Heavy Fuel Assistance Underway 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶2.  At the September 20 regular MFA press briefing, 
spokeswoman Jiang Yu told reporters she has not yet received 
a specific date for the Six-Party Talks, when asked about ROK 
media reports that the talks would resume September 27. 
Chinese heavy fuel assistance to the DPRK is under "active 
preparation and implementation," Jiang said. 
 
DPRK VFM Kim Yong-il in China 
----------------------------- 
 
¶3.  Jiang confirmed that VFM Wu Dawei met with DPRK VFM Kim 
Yong-il on September 18 to exchange views on the bilateral 
relationship.  VFM Kim told VFM Wu that the North Korean 
Workers' Party and Government attach great importance to the 
China-DPRK relationship, said Jiang.  VFM Kim is currently 
visiting cities "outside Beijing." 
 
Condemnation of Beirut Bombing 
------------------------------ 
 
¶4.  China "condemns" the September 19 bombing in Beirut, said 
the spokeswoman.  Jiang expressed "sincere hope" that parties 
in Lebanon can realize conciliation through consultation and 
dialogue in the interest of stability and development. 
 
"Concern" Over Hamas's "Hostile Entity" Designation 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶5.  China is "concerned" over Israeli designation of Hamas as 
a "Hostile Entity" and the subsequent sanctions on the Gaza 
Strip, stated Jiang, adding that such sanctions will lead to 
further tensions and will affect the humanitarian situation. 
 
Dalai Lama Represents a "Splittist Force" 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  China has expressed its solemn position to Germany, said 
Jiang in response to a question on why China opposes the 
Dalai Lama's visit to Germany and what effect the visit will 
have on Sino-German relations.  She remarked that countries 
are fully aware "what kind of person" the Dalai Lama is from 
his activities.  The Dalai Lama is not a "purely religious 
figure," but a "political exile" engaged in activities aimed 
at "splitting the Motherland under the name of religion," she 
continued.  Jiang said that the Dalai Lama's activities are 
not just those of an individual, but rather he represents a 
"splittist force."  China is against his "splittist" 
activities in any country and opposes any country's use of 
the Dalai Lama issue to interfere in China's internal 
affairs. 
 
Climate Change 
-------------- 
 
¶7.  International cooperation on climate change should 
proceed under the "main framework" and principles defined in 
the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and 
Kyoto Protocol recognized and accepted by the international 
 
BEIJING 00006198  002 OF 002 
 
 
community, stated Jiang.  China holds that countries should 
follow the principle of common but differentiated 
responsibility.  Developed countries should take the lead in 
reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and developing 
nations should also make efforts "within the line of 
sustainable development," said Jiang, adding that China will 
continue its efforts to reduce GHG emissions and increase its 
capacity to meet the challenge of climate change. 
 
Zimbabwe Should Decide Own Situation 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶8.  China's relationship with Zimbabwe is founded on the 
basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence, and the 
situation in Zimbabwe should be decided by the Zimbabwean 
people and Government, stated Jiang when asked to clarify 
Special Envoy Liu Guijin and the Chinese Ambassador to 
Zimbabwe's conflicting comments on what aid China is giving 
to Zimbabwe.  Jiang said that countries should make 
constructive efforts to Zimbabwe's development. 
 
No Comment on Taiwan Issues 
--------------------------- 
 
¶9.  The spokeswoman said questions on a Taiwan letter to the 
Beijing Olympic Committee regarding the Olympic torch route 
and the refusal of Taiwan Vice Premier Chiou I-jen to attend 
the Fourth Women's Soccer Forum in Shanghai were outside her 
realm of responsibility and should be referred to the 
relevant organs. 
 
Cook Islands PM Visit September 24-30 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶10.  Prime Minister Jim Marurai of the Cook Islands will pay 
an official visit September 24-30 at the invitation of PM Wen 
Jiabao, Jiang announced.
