SUBJECT: FINNLAND SUPPORTS EU BORDER MISSION FOR LEBANON 
 
REF: SECSTATE 128335 
 
Classified By: POLCHIEF GREGORY THOME FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
 
¶1. (C) PolChief delivered subject demarche to Mika-Markus 
Leinonen, Office Director of the Finnish MFA's Unit for 
Civilian Crisis Management, Sept. 17.  Leinonen welcomed 
the fact that the US supports a joint EU-Arab border 
mission for Lebanon and noted that the Finnish Government 
is very supportive of the concept.  He reported that many 
EU member states joined Finland in expressing support at 
the Sept. 14 PCS, but added that "many unanswered 
questions" remain (i.e., scope; size; security parameters 
and mandate; civilian vs. military emphasis; Arab country 
participation, etc.).  Consensus is building for an EU 
fact-finding mission to the region which, like the mission 
itself, the Finns support. 
 
¶2. (C) Leinonen noted that at this time he could not 
reasonably comment on what type of contribution Finland 
might make to such a mission.  He opined that the long- 
scheduled drawdown of a 240-troop engineering battalion at 
the end of this year could, theoretically, free up some 
resources.  In addition, there would be fairly good 
domestic political support for a small civilian monitoring 
or training contribution.  However, Leinonen added that 
civilian border monitors, in particular, are a "very scarce 
commodity" in Finland and throughout the EU.  He also 
acknowledged PolChief's arguments regarding the need to 
minimize engagement with Syria, but suggested that to a 
certain extent the mission's success would depend on at 
least some communication with Damascus.
