REF: A) USDOC 05667 B)HK05511 
 
1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO), 
accompanied by Commercial Officer Brock Wilson, conducted a post 
shipment-verification (PSV) at Sanmina-SCI Enclosure Systems (Asia) 
Limited (Sanmina), Enclosure 5, FK Ader Bldg., 22 Kai Cheung Road, 
Kowloon Bay, Hong Kong.  The items in question are fifty pieces of 
polyurethane foam valued at USD 3,633.  The exporter's shippers 
export declaration (SED) lists the export control classification 
number (ECCN) for the items as 1C001.  If properly classified by the 
exporter, these items are controlled for national security (NS) and 
missile technology (MT) reasons and would most likely require a 
license for export or reexport to Hong Kong and mainland China.  The 
exporter is Cuming Corporation of St. Avon, Massachusetts.  Sanmina 
was the subject of a previous, favorable, PSV referenced in reftel 
¶B. 
 
¶3.  According to the Hong Kong Companies Registry, Sanmina has been 
in existence since 1992.  Its paid up share capital is the Hong Kong 
equivalent of approximately USD eight million.  Its two directors 
are U.S. nationals.  A review of the company's website 
(www.sanminasci.com) indicates that the company is an affiliate of 
Sanmina-SCI Corporation, a San Jose California based electronics 
contract manufacturer in the communications, defense and aerospace, 
industrial and medical instrumentation, multimedia and consumer, 
computer and server and automotive technology sectors.  The company 
has worldwide operations including several manufacturing locations 
in mainland China. 
 
¶4.  The ECO, accompanied by Commercial Officer Brock Wilson, visited 
Sanmina at the address referenced above on August 28, 2007 and met 
with Ms. Eva Ng, Shipping Officer.  She stated that the company 
conducts electronics manufacturing in five locations in mainland 
China for various multinational corporations.  Hong Kong acts as the 
regional headquarters for the company.  Imports and exports for the 
China market are conducted through Hong Kong.  Ms. Ng stated that 
Cuming is a regular supplier for Sanmina.  She further stated that 
Sanmina does not apply for Hong Kong strategic commodities licenses 
because Sanmina does not import or export strategic items. 
 
¶5.  As to the specific items in question, Ms. Ng stated that they 
are used in the production of metal casings for servers.  The items 
will be used to reduce the noise levels of such servers.  The 
casings are being produced for Ciena (www.ciena.com), a U.S. network 
hardware company. Initially, Ms. Ng promised to provide shipping 
documentation confirming receipt of the items in Hong Kong and their 
subsequent on-shipment to mainland China.  ECO later obtained those 
documents from a colleague of Ms. Ng as Ms. Ng had apparently left 
the company two days after the PSV. 
 
¶6. In light of the totality of the circumstances of this check, ECO 
suspects that the exporter misclassified this items as falling 
within ECCN.  ECO therefore recommends that BIS complete a commodity 
classification before reaching a final decision on how to classify 
this PSV.  If the ECCN is as stated by Cuming, the ECO may reach out 
to Hong Kong TID for follow-up by Hong Kong Customs since this ECCN 
would most likely require a license for import into and export from 
Hong Kong. 
 
¶7.  At the time visited, Sanmina appeared to be a suitable recipient 
of the commodities shipped since Sanmina cooperated with the PSV and 
operates a line of business consistent with its use.  Nonetheless, 
the items, as classified by the exporter, require an export license 
to both Hong Kong and mainland China, which license was not 
obtained.  Subject to the outcome of the recommended action in 
paragraph 6, the ECO therefore recommends that this PSV be 
classified as Unfavorable.
