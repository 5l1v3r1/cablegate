¶1. (U) SUMMARY:  U.S. military assets concluded emergency 
relief operations on September 17.  Assets flew a total of 
136 sorties and transported some 595,000 lbs of relief 
supplies and materials over a 10-day period.  On September 17 
the Government of Nicaragua (GON) disaster team (SINAPRED) 
closed operations and turned control over to the regional 
government for the "rehabilitation" phase.  The OFDA team 
returned to Managua on September 17 and ceased emergency 
control room operation at COB on September 18.  OFDA will 
keep one person each in Puerto Cabezas and Managua through 
the weekend.  USAID will continue to monitor the relief 
delivery and initial reconstruction efforts of its partners 
and undertake an assessment about additional OFDA funding 
requirements.  END SUMMARY.
