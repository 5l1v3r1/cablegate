¶1. (U) THIS CABLE IS SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED AND NOT FOR INTERNET 
DISTRIBUTION. 
 
¶2. (U) On August 28, 2007, ESTH Counselor and ESTH Officer met with 
Minister Santiago Mourao and Counselor Luiz Fernando Galvao of the 
Ministry of External Relations (MRE) Division of Disarmament and 
Sensitive Technologies to discuss REFTEL and the upcoming Technical 
Seminar on the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1737 
proposed during the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) Consultative Group 
and Plenary meetings in Cape Town in April 2007.  The meeting is 
proposed for September 26, 2007 in Vienna.  It will be chaired by 
the United Kingdom and hosted by the USG. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Mourao and Galvao stated that they were not aware of the 
meeting, but were receptive of the draft agenda (including national 
presentations) and proposed technical concept for the meeting. 
Mourao said that the GOB would likely attend, but outside of their 
representatives in Vienna, at this point did not know which 
technical and export licensing experts would attend.  (Comment: 
Mourao appeared to see this technical seminar as similar to a 
proposal by the GOB at the Cape Town plenary meeting and agreed with 
its usefulness and purpose.  He also added that he believed that the 
USG and GOB positions on this issue are close, unlike the positions 
of Russia and China which different greatly. End Comment). 
 
¶4. (U) Post will continue to communicate with GOB as requested to 
facilitate the GOB's participation in this meeting.
