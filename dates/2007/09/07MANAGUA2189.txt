The Government of Nicaragua announced its support for Dominique 
Strauss-Kahn as candidate for Director General of the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF).  The announcement was made official on Tuesday 
September 18 by Antenor Rosales, President of the Central Bank of 
Nicaragua and Country Governor to the IMF. 
 
Nicaragua hopes that the election of Strauss-Kahn as General 
Director of the IMF will increase support from the international 
financial organism for national efforts made towards the increase of 
economic growth, the creation of wealth and the reduction of poverty 
levels that exist in the country. 
 
During the meeting in Mexico City between Strauss-Kahn and the 
Presidents of the Central Banks of Mexico, Central America, the 
Dominican Republic and Haiti, the President of the Central Bank of 
Nicaragua discussed the role poor countries play inside 
international organizations, the representation mechanisms of 
Central America in the IMF, and the need to strengthen bilateral 
communication and democratization in the election of the 
organization's officials.
