REF: SECSTATE 129764 
 
¶1. (SBU) On September 18, Poloff delivered reftel demarche on 
priorities for the Communities of Democracies (CD) to Ron 
Adam, Director of the UN Political Affairs Department at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which also handles the CD 
portfolio.  Adam expressed Israel's support for the Community 
of Democracies, and said the Foreign Minister would try to 
attend the meeting chaired by Mali on the margins of UNGA. 
He could not commit the Foreign Minister, as she was leaving 
New York that day, October 1, and already had a fairly full 
schedule including an address to the General Assembly.  Adam 
did indicate that if Secretary Rice thought it was of 
particular importance for FM Livni to attend the meeting, 
that we should communicate that as soon as possible. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Adam noted that FM Livni would not be able to attend 
the biennial ministerial in Bamako, or provide direct 
support, as Israel does not have diplomatic relations with 
Mali.  However, he said they were planning on sending 
working-level representation and were interested in seeing 
the draft communique being prepared for the ministerial when 
it was ready. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Adam had not seen the proposal for a CD 
Secretariat, but responded positively to the idea and said 
 
SIPDIS 
the GOI would be interested in getting more information, 
including make-up of the small international staff, before 
the October 1 meeting.  With regards to the other actions, 
Adam noted that Israel has already made a pledge to the UN 
Democracy Fund (UNDEF).  He said Israel is particularly 
interested in highlighting the role of NGOs, civil society 
and strong institutions in democracy building.
