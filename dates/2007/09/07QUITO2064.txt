¶1.  (U) This is an urgent action request.  Post requests 
immediate clearance of the draft diplomatic note on security 
cooperation activities in Ecuador during FY 2008 (see para. 
2).  The language of the diplomatic note is identical to the 
one sent last year except for a new line stating that the MOD 
and the police have approved the training calendars.  Once 
cleared, post will deliver the diplomatic note to the Foreign 
Ministry and seek a response by September 30 so that 
activities planned starting on October 1 can continue on 
schedule. 
 
¶2.  (U) Begin draft text of diplomatic note: 
 
The Embassy of the United States of America presents its 
compliments to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the 
Republic of Ecuador and has the honor to propose to the 
ministry that the Government of the Republic of Ecuador and 
the Government of the United States of America renew their 
commitment to military cooperation by approving the attached 
schedule of training, exercises, and other activities, which 
covers the period from October 1, 2007, to September 30, 2008. 
 
The Embassy proposes that these activities be conducted under 
the same terms and conditions originally outlined in this 
Embassy,s Diplomatic Note No. 065/97 of October 8, 1997, and 
accepted by the government of Ecuador in its Note. No. 167 gm 
of October 8, 1997.  The terms and conditions of the 
agreement have been reviewed every year since then by the two 
governments.  The Minister of Defense, the Chief of Staff and 
the National Police Commander have approved the attached 
training calendar as per the enclosed official communications 
(Note:  E-mailed to WHA/AND and WHA/PPC).  Additional 
exercises, training, seminars, subject-matter-exchanges, 
engineer infrastructure construction projects, conferences, 
reunions, and other events may be added or modified 
throughout the year when approved for execution by the 
Minister of Defense, the Chief, Joint Forces Command of the 
Ecuadorian military, or the Military Service Commander who is 
sponsoring the activity.  If the proposed schedule and terms 
and conditions for these activities are agreeable to the 
government of Ecuador, the Embassy of the United States has 
the further honor to propose that this note and the 
Ministry,s affirmative reply shall constitute an agreement 
between the two governments, which shall enter into force on 
the date of the Ministry,s reply with effect from October 1, 
¶2007. 
 
Furthermore, the Embassy proposes the following verbiage for 
the Ministry response.  The Ministry of Foreign Relations has 
the further honor to inform the Embassy of the United States 
of America that the proposals set forth in the Embassy,s 
Note are acceptable to the Government of Ecuador and to 
confirm that the Embassy,s note and this Note shall 
constitute an agreement between the two governments, which 
shall enter into force on this date with effect from October 
1, 2007. 
 
The Embassy avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs the assurances of its highest and 
most distinguished consideration.
