Â¶1.  (U) EconOff delivered reftel demarche points to Otavio 
Brandelli, Chief of the Division of Intellectual Property Rights at 
the Ministry of External Relation,s on 
September 17.  Brandelli said that the GoB feels it should adopt a 
"low profile" on the issue to avoid alienating the African Group or 
the USG.  He added that, if the GoB called for the resignation of 
Idris, this could be misinterpreted by other developing countries, 
particularly in Africa.
