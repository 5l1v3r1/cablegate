SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Formal CFC meetings were cancelled this week due to a 
meeting with a Sudanese Government delegation to discuss the 
Janjaweed Disarmament Plan (septel) and the visit of the UN 
Secretary General.  However, some progress was made on a key CFC 
 
SIPDIS 
case when some of the vehicles stolen from AMIS in May were returned 
by the SLM/Minawi.  End summary. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
FOUR OUT OF FIVE PROMISED VEHICLES RETURNED 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) During a recent meeting with AMIS Force Commander Gen 
Agwai, Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM)/Minawi General Commander 
Jumah Hagar promised to return five of the 13 vehicles stolen from 
Labado in May as a result of the Um Zeifa road collision to show 
good faith.  On September 3, three of the vehicles were released to 
AMIS at Military Group Site (MGS) Muhajeria, two Landcruisers and 
one Hilux.  The vehicles were stripped to some degree.  The El 
Fasher vehicle was returned on September 6, in bad repair. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Force Commander briefed on September 4 that the 
SLM/Minawi General Commander had promised to deliver four vehicles 
in Muhajeria and one in El Fasher.  The last vehicle still has not 
been delivered at Muhajeria.  On September 5, Field Off discussed 
the vehicle return issue with SLM/Minawi CFC Senior Representative 
Col. Adam Ali War.  War said the SLA/M was upset that all of the 
vehicles had not yet been returned.  War also indicated that SLA/M 
may return the remaining eight vehicles soon, without waiting for 
the Joint Commission to act on the Um Zeifa RTA, which FieldOff 
strongly encouraged.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) While the recommendations of the Um Zeifa RTA report are 
not quid pro quos, we would be pleasantly surprised if the remaining 
eight vehicles were returned prior to the Joint Commission approving 
the report.  However, the SLA/M will likely demand compensation for 
the death of its driver before returning the remaining vehicles. 
End comment.
