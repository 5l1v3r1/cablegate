¶1.  (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- Please handle 
accordingly. 
 
¶2. (SBU) SUMMARY:  Mission submits for Department's review a package 
of $41.5 in military assistance to Indonesia for FY2008 under 
Section 1206 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to 
conduct counterterrorism operations in the Sulawesi Sea area.  This 
package has been coordinated with other regional missions and 
approved by USPACOM and is consistent with reftel legislative 
requirements.  USPACOM has prioritized the Indonesia projects and 
will authorize them as funds become available during the year.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
------------- 
Justification 
------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) While the maritime environment in Southeast Asia continues 
to improve through concerted application of US engagement and 
capacity building resources, terrorist groups are seeking to 
circumvent existing U.S. and partner nation efforts by exploiting 
alternate sea transit routes, ungoverned or under-governed harbors, 
inland waterways, and land borders.  One primary area of such 
activity is the so-called tri-border area encompassing the Sulawesi 
and Sulu seas bordering Indonesia, Malaysia and Philippines. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Mission-proposed assistance for FY2008 would further 
increase partner nation capacity to monitor and control this area, 
particularly those parts of it which are most vulnerable to 
terrorist exploitation.  This effort builds upon previous maritime 
security initiatives under Section 1206 and other programs.  The 
essential strategy of the package is to provide domain awareness at 
strategic points, with the objective of restricting the transit 
routes and safe-havens available to terrorists, channeling their 
activities into more predictable, targetable patterns. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Increased Maritime Situational Awareness will also 
facilitate Indonesian agencies' efforts in other important areas, 
including suppression of crime and illegal activities, responding to 
maritime disasters and accidents, conducting search and rescue 
operations and protecting national fisheries.  The system allows 
sharing of data, as appropriate, to international partners, notably 
Malaysia, Philippines and JIATF Fusion Centers. 
 
¶6. (SBU) The package also refines certain aspects of previously 
installed systems along other critical Indonesian waterways:  the 
Strait of Malacca, the singularly most important commercial and 
strategic passage in the world, and the Maluku Sea, linking the 
southern Banda Sea with the Sulawesi Sea area. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Mission is earmarking an appropriate portion of future FMF 
grants to Indonesia to maintain and sustain the current Indonesia 
1206 proposals. 
 
-------------------------- 
Components of the Proposal 
-------------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) Mission's FY08 1206 proposal consists of two coastal 
surveillance stations, surveillance aircraft, communications and 
information sharing, and de-manning coastal surveillance stations to 
address security concerns discussed in the background.  (The 
following components are not listed in order of USPACOM 
prioritization.) 
 
a. Coastal Surveillance Stations (CSS):  Extends the Integrated 
Maritime Surveillance System (IMSS) station chain begun in previous 
years by two stations to guard a newly identified terrorist transit 
route west of Sulawesi Island.  Cost:  $3.536 million. 
 
b. A C4I Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Network: 
Connects the surveillance stations within the Sulawesi Sea area and 
links them with the network created with previous 1206 funding in 
the Malacca Strait and Sulawesi Sea area.  The overall network will 
give the Indonesian East and West Fleet Command Centers, 
Headquarters and Regional Command Centers a low-cost imagery-sharing 
capability.  Cost:  $4.1 million. 
 
c. Automated Common Operational Picture (COP):  The network will be 
equipped with software to track and correlate maritime targets, 
providing a single, integrated picture from multiple inputs.  Cost: 
$2.969 million.

d. Western Fleet Regional Command Center Trident Monitoring System: 
Provides a real-time imagery display and a command-and-control 
system, installed on a LAN shared by operator stations within the 
Indonesian Headquarters, Fleet Regional Command Center.  Cost: 
$1.544 million. 
 
e. Four Schweizer RU-38B Aircraft:  Extends the range of the coastal 
surveillance stations as needed, particularly into more remote 
locations and are broken out in two pairs of aircraft.  Cost: 
$11.522 million a pair, $23.044 million total. 
 
f. De-Manning (automation) of coastal surveillance stations: 
Automates the data collection, thereby removing human error and 
increasing the volume of information gathered.  Digitalization of 
information makes it easier to manage and allows for near-realtime 
dissemination and synchronization among the other local, 
inter-departmental and regional sources.  This involves three series 
of stations: 
 
-- Malacca Strait:  (10 stations) created with FY 2006 funding. 
Cost:  $3.492 million. 
 
-- Sulawesi Sea (8 stations) created with FY 2007 1206 funding. 
Cost:  $2.167 million. 
 
-- Maluku Sea (2 stations) created with FY 2008 1206 funding.  Cost: 
 .686 million.
