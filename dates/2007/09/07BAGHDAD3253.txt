This is a Ninewa Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) message. 
 
¶1. (SBU) On September 17, United Nations Assistance Mission 
for Iraq (UNAMI) Special Representative to the Secretary 
General (SRSG) Ashraf Qazi visited the blast sites in 
Qahtaniya and Al-Jazeera (reftels) to see the situation on 
the ground and assess the possibility of UNAMI coordination 
of future relief efforts.  Accompanied by Deputy PRT Leader, 
Brigade Combat Team (BCT) Commanding Officer, and UNAMI staff 
members, Qazi met the Governor Kashmoula and Deputy Governor 
Ghoran of Ninewa and mayors of the affected districts who 
informed him on the relief efforts to date and asked for more 
help. 
 
Assessment is Needed 
-------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The SRSG condemned the August 14 attacks on the 
Yezidi villages, and expressed interest in providing further 
assistance to the towns affected by the blasts and discussed 
potential long-term reconstruction efforts in the area. 
However, he stressed the importance of a full and complete 
assessment of the villages, household by household, to ensure 
that the needs of the people are fulfilled.  He suggested 
that the local government coordinate with the provincial 
government and Iraqi Red Crescent to conduct such an 
assessment.  The Governor stated that the Government of Iraq 
(GOI) had offered USD ten million in reconstruction aid to 
the villages, but none of that money had been disbursed. 
(Note: Condolence payments financed by the GOI had already 
been disbursed to most of the victims.  The GOI is also 
determining how to target the USD ten million pledge of 
assistance; the Minister of Environment visited the area in 
early September to begin an assessment.  End note.) 
 
Equanimity of Aid Vital 
----------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Both the Governor and BCT Commanding Officer 
stressed the importance of equality in the provision of 
assistance to the victims of bombings in Ninewa Province. 
There had been numerous car bombs over the past months, and 
those the victims of those deserved the same level of 
assistance as the victims in Qahtaniya.  (Note: Two 
USAID-funded programs, the International Medical Corps and 
the International Relief and Development's Community 
Stabilization Program, are providing assistance to 
communities struck by car bombs this year in western Ninewa. 
The assistance includes delivery of potable water, 
psychosocial services for children, income generation 
activities, health clinic and school rehabilitation, and 
delivery of health services and supplies.  End note.) 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) The PRT will continue to work closely with our 
counterparts in the BCT to monitor the situation in the areas 
affected by the August 14 blasts.  We will also maintain 
close contact with UNAMI to coordinate future assistance.
