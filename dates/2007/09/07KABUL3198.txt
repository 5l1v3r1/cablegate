SUBJECT: AF: Fuel price spikes stabilizing, Iran blamed. 
 
Sensitive but Unclassified 
 
¶1. (U) Reporting from Embassy PRT's as well as Kabul-based Embassy 
FSN's confirmed that July and August 2007 saw an increase in fuel 
prices across Afghanistan that quickly caused an up-tick in other 
prices, as well as increased grumbling against the government in 
Afghanistan's coffee house conversations.  Fuel (gasoline) prices 
jumped from an average of USD .70 (35 Afghanis) per liter to 
approximately one (1) USD per liter (55 Afghanis), or USD 3.70 per 
gallon.  A Central Bank (DAB) official recently told Embassy 
Treasury Attach that the surge in fuel prices occurred several 
months ago, but its impact is only recently being felt.  The 
official also claimed that fuel prices have started to decline since 
the July/August surge. 
 
¶2. (U) Citing higher transportation costs, many shopkeepers have 
increase prices.  Ghee (clarified butter) and sugar, basic stables 
in the local diet, have seen as much as a ten percent increase 
according to monthly Market Basket Survey results from PRT 
Mazar-e-Sharif, with similar results from other PRT's.  Mazar 
residents complain rising public transportation prices have made it 
increasingly inaccessible to the groups it is aimed at serving. 
 
¶3. (U) In a recent meeting with U.S. Commerce Secretary Gutierrez, 
Minister of Commerce and Industry Farhang and Finance Minister Ahady 
blamed the price hikes on Iran's recent decision to restrict the 
export of gasoline.  They described the move as a result of Iranian 
anticipation that increasingly stringent economic sanctions were 
soon to be applied by the international community.  According to 
Ahady and Farhang, Iran lacks sufficient refining capacity and is a 
net importer of gasoline.  The prohibition on exports was reportedly 
aimed at creating a sufficient domestic stockpile in anticipation of 
economic hard times.  The ministers claim that as a result, regional 
trade patterns have been disrupted and some neighboring nations have 
imposed a USD 100/ton export levy on gasoline.  Afghanistan has only 
one small refinery and is basically dependent on imported gasoline 
for all its fuel needs. 
 
¶4. (U) Comment:  While any increase in fuel prices and/or the 
regular Afghan basket of good requires close observation, a jump in 
fuel prices prior to the "heating" season in Afghanistan, which 
begins in mid-November, is cause for increased monitoring and 
concern.  Afghans already deal with a lack of sufficient electricity 
for lighting.  Increases in fuel costs, transportation costs and 
everyday living expenses as well as possible spikes in home heating 
fuel cost could create difficulties for many in the coming months, 
and might translate into public calls for the IRoA to "do 
something," and a commensurate erosion of support for the 
government.  End Comment.
