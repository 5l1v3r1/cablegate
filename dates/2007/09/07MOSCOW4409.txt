Begin Response: 
 
The Commission of the Russian Federation for UNESCO acknowledges 
receipt of your letter dated 2 August, 2007 informing the Commission 
of its candidacy for election to the Intergovernmental Council of 
the International Hydrological Programme (IHP) at the elections to 
be held during the 34th session of the UNESCO Headquarters, Paris. 
 
Taking due account of the traditionally benevolent relations that 
have been established between our National commissions the Russian 
side will gladly support the American candidature at the forthcoming 
elections. 
 
Since the Russian Federation has also presented its candidacy to the 
IHP Intergovernmental Council from its Electoral Group, Russian 
National Commission for UNESCO has the honor to propose reciprocal 
support of the candidatures of our two countries at the 
aforementioned elections. 
 
Please accept the assurances of my highest consideration. 
 
Yours sincerely, Grigory Ordzhonikidze, Secretary-General, 
Commission of the Russian Federation for UNESCO 
 
End Response.
