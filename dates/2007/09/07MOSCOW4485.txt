(U) MFA DVBR officer Alexander Deyneko told us September 12 
that Russia would support the U.S. version of the letter from 
the UNSCR 1540 Committee requesting permission to make public 
the matrices identifying gaps in individual member states' 
fulfillment of their UNSCR 1540 obligations.  He said 
instructions to support the U.S. version had been forwarded 
to the Russian mission in New York.
