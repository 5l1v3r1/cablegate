SUBJECT: Response to Import Safety Request 
 
REFTEL: State 114788 
 
¶1.  (U) This is a response cable to State 114788, regarding starting 
an import safety dialogue with host countries. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) EconCouns raised the issue of an import safety dialogue 
with Foreign Ministry Under Secretary for Trade Mentor Villagomez 
and shared reftel's talking points.  Villagomez undertook to review 
the matter with his colleagues, but from his limited response it 
appeared that he (and probably the GOE as a whole) had not 
considered the safety of imported or exported products on a 
comprehensive basis.  He noted that the GOE might be interested in a 
dialogue with the U.S. on import safety and that it might be a topic 
that could be addressed in the forthcoming bilateral Economic 
Dialogue.  In particular, Villagomez wants to ensure that import 
safety issues do not become an obstacle to Ecuadorian exports. 
 
¶3.  (U) Post also shared information on the import safety dialogue 
with Corpei, Ecuador's public-private export promotion agency. 
Ricardo Estrada, Executive President of Corpei, noted that Corpei 
would be willing to host delegations for work on an import safety 
dialogue and is willing to work with the GOE and USG on the issue. 
He commented that Corpei is working on promoting traceability in 
Ecuador, so that products can be traced all the way back to the 
producer.  He also noted that Corpei is working on a project with 
the Inter-American Development Bank and APHIS to work on sanitary 
and phytosanitary pest problems, which affect plant safety. 
 
¶4.  (U) In the food products area, the Ecuadorian health authority 
has been working on a number of processes that would improve the 
safety of exports.  Over the past few years, the Ministry of Health 
(MOH) has made efforts to design and implement a Good Manufacturing 
Practices (GMP) system for low-acidified and acidified foods (such 
as canned fruit and vegetables, and pouched tuna), with some support 
from USDA and the Food and Drug Administration. However, in order to 
be implemented, the system requires additional work and economic 
resources.  USDA officials have engaged in preliminary conversations 
with the MOH regarding this topic with the aim of finding 
opportunities for interagency cooperation.  With the objective of 
improving the implementation of quality control systems, the GOE is 
working on issuing a law for the creation of a public-private 
National Council for Quality (CONCAL).
