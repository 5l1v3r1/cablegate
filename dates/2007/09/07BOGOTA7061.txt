SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR BROWNFIELD,S SEPTEMBER 26 MEETING WITH 
FARC HOSTAGES, FAMILIES 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William R. Brownfield 
Reason: 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1.  (C) Summary: The Ambassador met September 26 with 
families of the three American hostages held by the FARC. 
The families appreciated the Ambassador's recent statements 
that he would not oppose other governments' efforts to 
resolve the hostages' detention.  The Ambassador stressed the 
importance of obtaining concrete communication and proof of 
life from the FARC, and he encouraged the families to make 
the same point to those involved in the current humanitarian 
exchange initiative.  The atmosphere throughout the meeting 
remained positive and cordial. End summary. 
 
¶2.  (U) The Ambassador, accompanied by DCM and ACS Chief, met 
September 26 at the Embassy with family members of FARC Amcit 
hostages Keith Stansell, Thomas Howes, and Marc Gonsalves. 
In attendance were Stansell's parents, Lynn and Gene 
Stansell; Gonsalves' father, George Gonsalves; and Howes' 
wife, Mariana Howes.  Also attending were Stansell's 15-year 
old son Kyle and Howes' ten-year old son Tommy.  Stephen 
Donehoo and Sarah King of the consulting firm Kissinger 
McLarty, which represents the families, also participated. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The Ambassador began by expressing openness to new 
ideas that might lead to the hostages' safe return.  He 
reiterated the U.S. policy against concessions to terrorists, 
noting that American lives had been saved as a result and 
more would in the future, but he repeated his previous public 
stance that the USG would not object if other countries or 
individuals were to facilitate their release from the FARC. 
The Ambassador explained that all options remain on the 
table, but stressed he would keep the welfare of the hostages 
foremost in his mind in considering any course of action. 
Lynn Stansell and Mariana Howes both expressed thanks in 
response to these points, and George Gonsalves said he 
"couldn't ask for more than that." 
 
¶4.  (C) The Ambassador described current efforts by 
Venezuelan President Chavez and Colombian Senator Piedad 
Cordoba as aimed at establishing lines of communication with 
a representative who could speak for the FARC.  Once those 
lines are open, he said, the next step would be for the FARC 
to provide proof of life and to state concretely their 
conditions for the hostages' release.  The Ambassador advised 
the families to make that same point during future 
conversations with President Chavez, Senator Cordoba, and 
others involved.  Chavez and Cordoba had volunteered to take 
on the facilitator role.  The families had a right to tell 
them what they expected. 
 
¶5.  (C) Mariana Howes described the families' meeting with 
President Chavez in Caracas the day before as "very 
positive," and Mr. Donehoo said Chavez understood the 
importance of obtaining proof of life.  The Ambassador said 
he would try not to say anything publicly that might 
complicate Chavez's role in facilitating the hostages' 
release. 
 
¶6.  (C) Mr. Donehoo reported that Senator Cordoba would meet 
with the FARC sometime in the next week and would request 
proof of life at that time.  He also said she would take with 
her photos and letters from the families for delivery to the 
hostages.  Mr. Donehoo expected Senator Cordoba to brief him 
on the meeting afterwards. 
 
¶7.  (U) In response to Mr. Donehoo's concerns about 
sometimes-inconsistent GOC messages about the current 
initiative, the Ambassador noted that events have moved 
quickly and surmised that the GOC might not yet have 
formulated a government-wide public posture.  He assured the 
families that as President Uribe determined how to proceed he 
would set an appropriate GOC line and his minister's would 
follow it. 
 
¶8.  (U) Mr. Donehoo concluded the meeting by thanking the 
Ambassador on behalf of the families for his approach to the 
hostage issue.  He and the Ambassador agreed that they would 
serve as the principal channel of communication for the 
families, although the Ambassador invited the families to 
contact him directly if they wished.  Throughout the meeting, 
the families' maintained a positive, collaborative attitude, 
and expressed hope that the current initiative would bear 
fruit.
