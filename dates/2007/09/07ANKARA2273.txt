¶3. Arrivals:  Attendees who have not already done so should notify 
Elaine Taylor and Dale Eppler via email of their flight arrival and 
departure times.  We suggest that attendees book the Vista Travel 
Service for airport arrival and departure. Those who want to use 
this service should notify Elaine Taylor by email and the Consulate 
will then arrange for a Vista driver to be waiting with a name 
placard at the airport.  The one-way fare is USD 35 payable in cash 
to the driver; a receipt will be delivered to the hotel.  Round trip 
fares of USD 70 can be paid on the first leg of the trip and a 
receipt will be provided on the return leg.  Attendees also can take 
taxis from the airport for which the fare is approximately YTL 45 or 
USD 36. A separate arrangement will be made for U/S Jeffery. 
 
¶4. Hotel: Arrangements have been made for participants to stay at 
the Conrad Hilton where the conference meetings will take place. 
Reservations should be confirmed through the consulate rather than 
directly with the hotel.  The Conrad is located at Yildiz Caddesi, 
Besiktas, 34353, Istanbul.  The telephone and fax numbers, 
respectively, are (90) 212 227-3000 and (90) 212 227-3407. 
 
ANKARA 00002273  002 OF 003 
 
 
Participants are, of course, free to stay elsewhere, but transport 
to off-site events will be arranged to and from the Conrad. 
Check-in time at the Conrad is 10 AM on Thursday, September 20. 
Attendees arriving before that time will be able to leave their 
luggage at the hotel until they check-in. 
 
¶5. Sightseeing:  For spouses interested in visiting some of 
Istanbul's many sites, the Consulate will arrange a sightseeing 
program on a self-pay basis for Friday, September 21.  Upon request, 
the Consulate can make additional arrangements for English-speaking 
guides.  Consulate Istanbul requests attendees notify Elaine Taylor 
no later than September 13 of their interests and requests for 
guides so that they can contract services. 
 
¶6. Conference fee: To defray the cost of conference incidentals, 
dinner Thursday, lunch Friday, and transportation within Istanbul, 
participants will be charged a USD 150 conference fee.  This fee 
should be reimbursable as a separate item against attendees' travel 
orders.  We will collect this fee on Friday morning at the beginning 
of the Conference and provide a receipt for your travel voucher. 
 
¶7. Events: The Conference will kick off at 7:00 PM Thursday, 
September 20 with a welcome dinner hosted by Istanbul Consul General 
Sharon Wiener at her residence. Transportation will be provided to 
and from the Conrad.  Spouses are welcome, but we ask that you 
notify Elaine Taylor and Dale Eppler if your spouse plans to attend. 
 Dress for this dinner is casual. Dress for the conference meetings 
on Friday and Saturday, September 21 and 22, is similarly casual. 
Lunch Friday will be informal among the conference participants, and 
it will be at the Conrad.  For dinner Friday, one of the American 
Chamber of Commerce affiliates here, the American Business Forum in 
Turkey (ABFT), has offered to arrange a Bosporus cruise and dinner. 
Dress will be informal/smart casual. Spouses are welcome at this 
event, but we ask that you notify Elaine Taylor and Dale Eppler in 
advance if you and your spouse plan to attend. 
 
¶8.  Cultural Note: The Conference will be taking place during the 
Muslim holy month of Ramadan.  While Turkey is a secular country, 
many Turks will observe Ramadan by fasting between the hours of 
sunrise and sunset. 
 
¶9. Visas:  Please note that all Americans entering Turkey must have 
a valid visa.  Holders of official or diplomatic passports must 
obtain visas from the nearest Turkish embassy (not consulate) before 
arriving in Turkey.  Visas for official and diplomatic passports 
will NOT/NOT be available at ports of entry. The only exception is 
military personnel under CINC control traveling on NATO orders. 
Military IDs are NOT/NOT acceptable travel documents.  Travelers 
with tourist passports can obtain a visa valid for one entry/three 
months at ports of entry upon payment of a USD 20 fee in cash. (This 
fee is payable only in U.S. Dollars cash. Note that this could 
involve significant delay at the airport.) 
 
¶10. Security Assessment:  In light of ongoing military operations in 
Iraq and continued operations in support of the war on terrorism, 
there remains the potential for both transnational terrorist groups 
with anti-Western sympathies, to include Kongra Gel (formerly PKK), 
Revolutionary People's Liberation/Front (DHKP/C), Marxist-Leninist 
Communist Party (MLKP) Turkish Communist Party/Marxist Leninist 
(TKP/ML), Turkish Workers and Peasants Revolutionary Army (TIKKO) 
and Islamic Greater Eastern Raiders/Front (IBDA/C) continue to 
 
ANKARA 00002273  003 OF 003 
 
 
operate in Turkey. 
 
Attacks over the last few years attributed to these groups have 
occurred in the Aegean and Mediterranean coastal resort areas, as 
well as in Istanbul.  Most of the attacks, generally small-scale 
bombings, have occurred in neighborhoods of Istanbul not generally 
frequented by official Americans or tourists.  Also in 2005 and 2006 
public buses have been set on fire, with the most recent incident 
resulting in three deaths.  Thus far, these attacks on buses also 
have taken place in areas of Istanbul distant from official American 
or tourist destinations.  A Kurdish group ostensibly aligned with 
the PKK terrorists claimed responsibility for many of the incidents 
noted above, and in April 2006 this group issued a statement 
renewing a threat to target Turkey's tourism industry. 
 
Violent demonstrations have occurred throughout Turkey, the most 
recent in Istanbul and in several cities in Southeastern Turkey. 
Just as with members of Mission Turkey, USG visitors are required to 
obtain RSO Ankara and DCM approval for travel to the Southeast. 
 
Al-Qa'ida threats to target U.S. facilities in Turkey have been 
public knowledge for some time.  On November 15, 2003 two synagogues 
in Istanbul were the targets of suicide truck bombs.  On November 
20, 2003 the British Consulate General and the London based HSBC 
Bank in Istanbul were struck by powerful explosions, killing dozens 
and wounding hundreds.  Through prosecutions of those responsible 
are still ongoing, indications are that the indigenous radical 
Islamic terrorist group responsible was supported by the Al-Qa'ida 
network. The August 2005 discovery in Antalya of a potential plot 
against maritime interests and subsequent arrest of a Syrian 
Al-Qa'ida facilitator and planner further attest to the ongoing 
transnational threat. 
 
The incidence of crime, both violent and the more traditional 
tourists crimes (pick pocketing, purse-snatching, etc.), is 
relatively low throughout Turkey.  However, over the last year, 
there has been a marked increase in the number of crimes reported to 
Consulate General Istanbul.  Much of the crime is centered in the 
areas frequented by tourists, Consulate employees and official 
visitors.  Visitors should be particularly attentive for pick 
pockets in and around the Sultanahmet, Taksim Square, and Istiklal 
Caddesi areas of Istanbul.  Often pick pocketing is preceded by some 
sort of diversion, such as an argument or fight, or children asking 
to assist tourists, for example with their bags,  If you encounter 
such activity, secure your wallet or purse and quickly leave the 
area.  Another scam that is becoming more prevalent is that of a 
stranger approaching a visitor and striking up a conversation which 
is continued inside a restaurant or club, where one is either 
drugged and robbed or presented with an enormous bill and 
intimidated into paying it.  The security office encourages visitors 
to report any security incidents, including surveillance, to the RSO 
immediately.
