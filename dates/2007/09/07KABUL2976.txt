SUBJECT: LEAHY VETTING REQUEST: ANP RANK REFORM OF ANCOP POSITIONS 
(PART TWO OF THREE CABLES) 
 
¶1. This is an action request; please see paragraphs 2 and 3. 
 
¶2. In order to comply with Leahy vetting requirements, this cable 
forwards the names and biodata of fifty (50) Afghan National Police 
(ANP) field grade officers selected for positions in the Afghan 
National Civil Order Police (ANCOP).  These names are submitted as 
part of the of ANP Rank Reform process.  When there are individuals 
with one name, Post has made a good faith effort to ensure that 
these individuals actually only have one name.  For individuals for 
whom date of birth, ethnicity, and/or father's name is not 
available, Post has worked with CSTC-A and the MOI to retrieve this 
data.  Post will inform the Department immediately if additional 
data becomes available.  This is the second in a series of three 
cables. 
 
¶3. IMPORTANT NOTE:  The international community recently approved 
pay increases for ANP company grade officers (captains and 
lieutenants); however, pay increases for the field grade ANP 
personnel will not be approved until completion of Rank Reform. 
Currently, ANP field grade personnel earn less than their Afghan 
National Army (ANA) equivalents, a situation that is causing severe 
morale problems.  Completion of the ANP Rank Reform process will 
significantly alleviate deteriorating morale, which is why Post 
requests the Department's expedited vetting and response at the 
earliest possible date.  Post greatly appreciates Department's 
strong support for completing the ANP Rank Reform process.
