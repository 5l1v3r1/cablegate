SUBJECT: POLAND:  DELIVERY OF DEMARCHE ON U.S. PRIORITIES 
FOR 62ND UNGA 
 
REF: SECSTATE 130775 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Polcouns met September 25 with Beata Baranska, MFA 
Deputy Director for UN Affairs, to review U.S. priorities for 
the 62nd UNGA.  Baranska said that Poland generally would 
have the same goals for UNGA as last year.  Poland wants to 
see the reform process speeded up, especially on financing, 
and to revitalize the disarmament agenda.Regarding our 
points, Baranska had a few comments and questions: 
 
--Poland agrees with us generally on the points concerning 
Iran, Iraq, and the Middle East.  Poland agrees that there 
should be an effort to reduce the number of unhelpful 
Israel-related resolutions, but Baranska noted that for the 
Palestinians it is important for public opinion that no 
previous resolutions be dropped.  She expressed hope that 
some of the Israel-related resolutions that arose from the 
2006 conflict in Lebanon can be dropped as those issues are 
no longer relevant. 
 
--On climate change, Poland is going to organize a high level 
climate change conference in Poznan in December 2008 and so 
is very interested our position on climate issues, and in the 
September 27-28 meeting the Secretary will host on the issue. 
 
--On the U.S. plans to introduce a resolution in the Third 
Committee on "Condemning the use of rape as an instrument of 
state policy,"  Baranska asked if we had consulted the 
resolution already, as she was not familiar with it. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Baranska had no further detailed responses, but 
reiterated Poland's desire to work closely with us on a full 
range of issues.
