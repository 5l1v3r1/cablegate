REF: STATE 129919 
 
(SBU) On September 20, Poloff met with MFA West Asia and Africa 
Department Expert Vu Duy Thanh to deliver reftel points encouraging 
the Government of Vietnam (GVN) to make a financial contribution to 
the Special Tribunal for Lebanon.  Thanh noted that the GVN will 
need to step up and take more responsibility for matters such as the 
Tribunal, given the likelihood that Vietnam will occupy a temporary 
seat on the UN Security Council.  The GVN supports efforts to 
respond appropriately to Prime Minister Hariri's assassination, but 
Thanh added that any response must address the legitimate interests 
of all concerned parties and comply with international law.  He also 
mentioned that the GVN is not in a good position to contribute 
financially, nor is there any GVN precedent for contributing to the 
Tribunal.  Thanh said he would convey our message to MFA leadership 
for its consideration.
