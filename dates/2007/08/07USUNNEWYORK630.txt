SUBJECT: UNSC: QATAR AND INDONESIA DROP GAZA PRST 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Qatar and Indonesia formally abandoned July 30 an 
effort to push a UNSC Presidential Statement expressing 
concern about the humanitarian situation in Gaza, including a 
call to open the border crossings, after USUN advised the 
Council we would not be able to support the statement.  USUN 
noted that the Council had not condemnded the violent 
takeover of the Gaza strip by Hamas in June and that the 
Palestinians and Israelis did not support the effort. 
Notwithstanding their role in the Quartet, the Russians had 
expressed support for the statement.  Other Council members, 
citing the views of UN SYG Ban and UNSCO Michael Williams 
calling for the border crossings to be open to ameliorate the 
economic and humanitarian crisis, also had supported the 
statement.  Throughout discussions of the matter, the 
Palestinian representative, Riyadh Mansour, maintained 
unyielding opposition to the Qatari and Indonesian 
initiative, stating Palestinian "sovereignty" had been 
affronted because Qatar had not consulted with the 
Palestinian delegation.  The open rift between the two Arab 
delegations on an issue involving Palestinian matters, which 
reflects policy differences over Hamas, is extraordinary in 
the Security Council. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Below is the draft of the text that had been 
proposed by Qatar and Indonesia.  The two delegations had 
earlier dropped any reference to the government of Israel, 
feeding Palestinian suspicions that Qatar was seeking to 
embarrass the Palestinian Authority government. 
 
Draft PRST on the Middle East follows: 
 
The Members of the Security Council express their deep 
concern for the deteriorating humanitarian and economic 
situation in Gaza and its dire effect on the Palestinian 
population in Gaza. 
 
The Members of the Security Council also express their 
concern for the situation of the Palestinians stranded 
outside the Rafah border crossing and call for an expedient 
solution to ensure their urgent and safe return to Gaza. 
 
The Members of the Security Council call on all parties to 
ensure unhindered access for humanitarian assistance to the 
Palestinian people in Gaza to alleviate the situation and to 
open the border crossings into Gaza to facilitate the passage 
of imports and exports and the access of humanitarian workers 
to Gaza.  The Members of the Security Council stress the 
importance of the maintenance of a continuous and 
uninterrupted supply of fuel, electricity and water to Gaza. 
 
The Members of the Security Council call on the international 
community to continue to provide emergency and humanitarian 
assistance to the Palestinian people in Gaza to meet their 
dire humanitarian needs.
