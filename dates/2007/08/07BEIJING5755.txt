MILITARY STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT TO CODEL SKELTON 
 
¶1. (SBU) PLA General Zheng Shenxia told CODEL Skelton that 
transparency in strategic intent and expanded 
military-to-military exchanges enhance our bilateral 
relations and contribute to the stability of the Taiwan 
Strait.  General Zheng, Director of the Academy of Military 
Science, discussed the Academy's role in formulation and 
execution of China's strategic military doctrine.  The 
Academy chooses its research staff from among the PLA's 
combat units as well as military research institutes and 
headquarters.  AMS has begun using modeling and simulation 
support for doctrine development and looks forward to working 
with the United States in developing antiterrorism 
strategies.  "Active Defense," which includes the principles 
of having no military alliances and no troops posted 
overseas, continues to be the backbone of China's strategy. 
Active Defense strategy includes "proactive measures" to 
ensure Taiwan does not become independent.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) A delegation led by House Armed Services Committee 
Chairman Ike Skelton (D-MO) and including Representatives 
Randy Forbes (R-VA), John Spratt (R-SC), Robin Hayes (R-NC), 
Jeff Flake (R-AZ), Carol Shea-Porter (D-NH), Delegate 
Madeleine Bordallo (D-GU) and Rear Admiral Mark Ferguson, met 
with GEN Zheng Shenxia, Director of the Academy of Military 
Science (AMS), at the Academy August 27. 
 
ROLE OF THE AMS 
--------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) GEN Zheng said the National Defense University's 
purpose is to integrate new strategic and operational 
theories into PLA doctrine and training.  The AMS, in 
contrast, is a research institute which studies military 
theory and proposes innovations.  It is the center of 
military studies for the PLA and works directly for the 
Central Military Commission (CMC).  The Academy has four 
departments and one institution: 1) Department of War Theory 
and Strategic Studies; 2) Department of Operational Theory 
and Doctrine; 3) Department of Military Force Building 
Studies; 4) Department of World Military Studies; and the 
Institute for Military Operations Research and Military 
Analysis.  The Academy has 350 full-time researchers from 
various services and branches as well as military institutes, 
headquarters and other institutions.  The Academy conducts 
research in accordance with the missions designated by the 
CMC as well as other major issues of interest, and then 
presents these reports to the CMC for possible inclusion in 
PLA doctrine.  The Academy is an advisory body whose 
Department heads are chosen from among combat units as well 
as PLA educational institutions. 
 
¶4. (SBU) GEN Zheng underscored the rarity of true strategic 
thinkers and admitted there is great demand from the CMC and 
PLA for military theories.  "We have made great efforts, but 
still there are many gaps."  He agreed that it is difficult 
to find thinkers capable in both operational and strategic 
theory that can keep pace with the developments in military 
affairs. 
 
REDUCING THE POSSIBILITY OF MISUNDERSTANDING 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU)  GEN Zheng said he has discussed strategy 
development and implementation with numerous U.S. Department 
of Defense officials and academics.  The best way to avoid 
misunderstanding, he stressed, is to have transparent 
intentions in national strategy.  "Our strategy has remained 
the same for a long time:  Do not form military alliances. 
Do not deploy forces abroad.  Do not have an expansionist 
military strategy."  The development of the PLA is solely 
based on the need to protect China.  China is trying to shift 
its research methods from solely qualitative to quantitative 
and qualitative research.  China conducts simulations which 
combine operational theories with current conditions.  Noting 
differences in Chinese and U.S. culture, General Zheng said 
we should base our mil-to-mil exchanges on mutual respect and 
common interests.  Military transparency is enhanced through 
"mutual political confidence," General Zheng said, noting 
that new units, such as the Second Artillery, have now been 
opened to visiting delegations. 
 
TERRORISM AND WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) General Zheng said research into the threat of 
terrorist use of weapons of mass destruction is "just 
proceeding" at AMS, and although the tactics and techniques 
of anti-terrorism are not a specialty of the Academy, he 
hopes the United States and China can discuss the issue and 
share experiences and methods for preventing proliferation. 
"Today, time is limited," he said. "Later, I would like to 
 
BEIJING 00005755  002 OF 002 
 
 
make this a topic of discussion." 
 
¶7. (SBU) Representative Hayes (R-NC) congratulated GEN Zheng 
on China's impressive economic development and hosting of the 
2008 Olympic Games and noted that such success could attract 
terrorist attacks.  General Zheng said that while the CMC has 
assigned the task of developing a strategic theory of 
antiterrorism to the Academy, China still does not fully 
understand the threat. 
 
WHAT IS ACTIVE DEFENSE? 
----------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) General Zheng said that Active Defense has been 
China's strategy for a long time and that "Passive Defense" 
is inadequate for certain threats, in particular, the 
separatist activities of (Taiwan President) Chen Shui-bian. 
As long as Taiwan does not seek to split from China, then 
China will not use force.  Otherwise, something "more than 
defense" might be necessary.  Zheng avoided Congressman 
Flake's (R-AZ) direct question regarding the PRC's 
Taiwan-related redlines. 
 
¶9. (SBU) Chairman Skelton, acknowledging the importance and 
success of senior officer exchanges, said it is also 
important for lieutenants and captains to "make friendships 
early in their careers, before they have stars on their 
shoulders."  General Zhang agreed with the Chairman and said 
that China already has an exchange program with the United 
States Military Academy.  He reiterated the PLA's support for 
continued and expanded officer exchange programs. 
 
¶10. (U) The delegation cleared this cable.
