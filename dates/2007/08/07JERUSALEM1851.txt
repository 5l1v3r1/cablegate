the West Bank and Gaza and expansion of Palestinians, 
personal freedoms through a daily policy dialogue with the

High Level Visitors: Public and Private Messages 
 
¶2. (U) In the last two months, high-level visitors -- 
including the Secretary, Under Secretary Burns, and Under 
Secretary Hughes -- have met with Palestinian governmental 
 
SIPDIS 
and civil society leaders.  Post has used these visits to 
reinforce U.S. support for democratic institutions in a 
future Palestinian state and as opportunities to convey this 
message publicly. Examples of these efforts include: 
-  During an August 2 visit, the Secretary delivered a 
message of support for a democratic Palestinian state to the 
Palestinian President, Prime Minister and full cabinet. At a 
press conference to announce the $80 million security sector 
reform assistance, the Secretary emphasized this message to 
international and local media. 
- On August 18, U/S Burns conducted interviews with local 
media outlets, reaffirming the U.S. commitment to Palestinian 
people achieving a democratic state. The interviews received 
wide local and international exposure, including rebroadcast 
on al-Arabiya. 
- On July 24 and 25, U/S Hughes met with the PA Ministers of 
Information, Education, Youth and Sports, and the Deputy 
Minister of Women,s Affairs to underscore the President,s 
message of support for a democratic Palestinian state. U/S 
Hughes underscored US support through al-Jazeera and 
al-Arabiya interviews, as well as through a news feature 
program on a local news network. U/S Hughes reinforced this 
message in a speech delivered to leading Palestinian civil 
society figures at a Consulate hosted reception. 
- On July 19, Senior Coordinator for International Women,s 
Issues Bottner met with female Palestinian Ministers and 
Deputy Ministers and with judges and lawyers to discuss the 
legal status of women and U.S. support for strengthening 
women,s political participation in public life. 
 
Programmatic Support 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Post administers and supports wide-ranging Middle 
East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) and Public Diplomacy 
programming that supports the goals of achieving greater 
personal freedoms and improved democratic systems.  Through 
MEPI programming, we are supporting a portfolio of major 
programs (totaling more than $13 million in assistance) that 
will strengthen political parties, enable the broadcast of 
professional and objective news and feature reporting, and 
develop an active civil society that advocates for good 
governance and critical personal freedoms. In addition, Post 
just administered a successful MEPI small grant competition 
that will fund six civil society organizations working in 
different fields, including: preventing honor crimes, 
protecting minorities, rights, and encouraging volunteerism. 
 Three of this year,s small grants will support NGOs in 
particularly underserved areas: Hebron and Gaza. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) These MEPI programs complement a robust public 
diplomacy outreach and program campaign on the full range of 
issues to support the development of a viable, democratic 
Palestinian civil society.  These range from visiting speaker 
programs and digital video conferences (DVC) with American 
speakers on a variety of subjects, including a recent DVC 
with AmeriCorps, Susan Stroud that encouraged youth 
volunteerism and leadership, to the diverse portfolio of 
exchange programs that build the skills, networks, and 
exposure of civil society leaders. 
 
Upcoming Plans 
 
¶5. (SBU) With the formation of a PA government under PM Salam 
Fayyad, we have been able to reengage with PA counterparts. 
Leading up to the fourth Forum for the Future (FFF), we plan 
to engage with the Minister of Justice, the Minister of 
Youth, the Minister of Women,s Affairs, and the Minister of 
Information on the recommendations of last year,s FFF civil 
society dialogues.  We will report on these meetings in 
separate telegrams in the months ahead.
