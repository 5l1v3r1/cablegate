Summary 
======= 
 
¶2. (SBU) Political flags and banners have covered Jakarta in 
recent days as the capital prepares for its August 8 
gubernatorial election.  The activities of the two 
candidates--Deputy Governor Fauzi Bowo, representing a broad 
coalition of parties, and former police official Adang 
Daradjatun of the Islamic Prosperous Justice Party 
(PKS)--have dominated the news.  There have been various 
charges of electoral law violations, but no violence 
reported.  Adang remains the underdog in the race.  Most 
Jakartans appear apathetic.  Bio notes are contained in Para 
¶9.  End Summary. 
 
Election Looms 
============== 
 
¶3.  (U) Political flags and banners are covering Jakarta as 
the capital prepares for its gubernatorial election on August 
¶8.  Local press coverage of the campaign has increased 
dramatically in recent days, with the national papers 
devoting multi-page spreads to each candidate.  The two 
candidates have been holding rallies in various parts of the 
capital district with supporters.  Campaigning is scheduled 
to formally conclude by August 5. 
 
Charges and Counter-Charges 
=========================== 
 
¶4.  (U) Allegations of campaign misconduct and alleged dirty 
tricks have lately been thrown around by the two campaigns. 
Jakarta police have recorded four criminal cases, two 
administrative cases, and over 1700 traffic citations related 
to the campaigns, while an independent election watchdog 
group claims there have been 22 significant violations, 
including cases where campaigners have handed out money to 
prospective voters.  A flavor of the charges includes the 
Bowo camp's protest against the burning of banners in North 
Jakarta.  Adang and PKS, in the meantime, have filed a 
lawsuit over an allegedly Bowo-linked tabloid that criticized 
PKS and used an adult-oriented photo as the accompanying 
illustration. 
 
¶5.  (U) The campaign continues to be peaceful.  As of yet, no 
violence between the rival camps has been reported. 
 
Bowo Favored 
============ 
 
¶6.  (SBU) A late July poll of 600 registered voters showed 
more than half say they will select Bowo, with only 22 
percent saying they preferred Adang.  Over 20 percent of 
voters remained undecided.  Nevertheless, Adang reported 
receiving $3.5 million in campaign donations in the month of 
July as compared to Bowo's $1.2 million.  In addition, the 
youth wings of the Indonesian Democratic Party-Struggle 
(PDIP) and Democratic Party (PD) announced on 1 August they 
would break with their parent parties to back Adang, both 
possible signs that the race will be closer than polling 
indicates. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) An upcoming August 4 debate between the two 
candidates could afford Adang the opportunity to make up 
further ground.  Contacts have told us that they think that 
Adang has run the stronger campaign and is the more 
charismatic of the two.  That said, most observers do not see 
him getting more than 30-40 percent of the vote, though some 
say that even that sort of sum would give the Islamic-leaning 
PKS a symbolic victory.

Apathy Reigns 
============= 
 
¶8. (SBU) A recent poll indicates that as many as 65 percent 
of the 5.7 million registered voters in Jakarta may not vote, 
a stunningly low figure in a country where over 90 percent of 
eligible voters participated in the 2004 presidential 
election.  Many of our contacts have asserted to us that the 
campaign simply has not stirred Jakartans and they predict a 
very low turnout.
