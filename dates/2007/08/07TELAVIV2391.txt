Key Stories in the Media: 
------------------------- 
 
Leading media reported that Secretary Rice visited the West Bank on 
Thursday.  Maariv reported that Rice announced in Ramallah that the 
U.S. will give USD 80 million to PA Chairman Abu Mazen for upgrading 
the security services. 
 
Makor Rishon-Hatzofe reported that Secretary Rice told PA Chairman 
Abbas that PM Olmert agreed to put the "core issues" on the 
negotiation table. 
 
Yediot reported that the pardon deal for wanted Palestinian 
activists is near collapse. The paper quoted security officials as 
saying that it does not appear possible to carry out this goodwill 
gesture for the foreseeable future as PA Chairman Abbas is having 
difficulty exercising his authority and persuading the wanted men to 
meet Israel's conditions. 
 
Maariv reported that the Syrian army is training in guerilla warfare 
using Hizbullah their example.  This includes firing Katyusha 
rockets. The newspaper added that this is the first time in the 
world that a regular army has trained regular forces on a 
significant scale to operate as a guerrilla force.  The new 
guerrilla unit will operate as an integral part of the Syrian army. 
 
 
All media reported that tension between members of the Winograd 
committee and PM Olmert is growing. According to Yediot the 
committee is refusing to let Olmert see transcripts of testimonies 
it collected. 
 
Maariv reported that differences between PM Olmert and Defense 
Minister Barak are intensifying. The newspaper added that on 
cardinal security and foreign policy issues, the two find themselves 
on different sides. 
 
Leading media reported that the conflict between Hamas and Islamic 
Jihad is growing and that three people were killed and seven more 
wounded in violent clashes between the factions. 
 
Israel Radio reported that two Qassam rockets were launched towards 
Sderot. One person was lightly injured and some property damage was 
reported.

Summary: 
-------- 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn and Washington correspondent 
Shmuel Rosner wrote in the independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz: "It 
is obvious to everyone involved that Riyadh's presence will be 
crucial to the conference's success; the Saudi presence will upgrade 
it beyond another standard encounter between Israel and its 
immediate neighbors, and will indicate the revival of the political 
process with the support of the Sunni 'axis of moderation.'" 
 
Columnist Meron Benvenisti wrote in the independent, left-leaning 
Ha'aretz: "The clear formulations of those who head the Palestinian 
Authority leave no room for doubt: The circular path of time that 
characterizes this conflict has completed another circuit.  We are 
at the start of a 'peace process' like the one that occurred from 
1993-2001." 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Dov Kontorer wrote in conservative 
Russian-language Vesty: "This [international peace conference] is 
expected to create a 'positive counterbalance' to the obvious 
failure of American policy in Iraq and the inability of the White 
House to stop nuclear weapon production in Iran."

Â¶I. "Hurrah, The Saudis are Coming" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn and Washington correspondent 
Shmuel Rosner wrote in the independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz 
(08/03): "After a series of frustrating visits to the region, which 
were characterized by unpleasant talks with Prime Minister Ehud 
Olmert, Rice arrived in Jerusalem on Wednesday with an achievement: 
an initial agreement by Saudi Arabia to take part in the peace 
conference ... President Bush wants to convene this fall.  It is 
obvious to everyone involved that Riyadh's presence will be crucial 
to the conference's success; the Saudi presence will upgrade it 
beyond another standard encounter between Israel and its immediate 
neighbors, and will indicate the revival of the political process 
with the support of the Sunni 'axis of moderation.'.... The indirect 
messages Rice conveyed between Olmert and King Abdullah did not go 
beyond the conventional in Israel's relations with the Arab world. 
As always, the Arabs want to discuss essence, whereas the Israelis 
are more interested in a photo-op. In exchange for their 
participation in the conference, the Saudis want to discuss the 
'core issues'.... In response, Olmert said that the Persian Gulf 
representatives would have to hold political status and not be made 
up of junior officials or ambassadors.  The Saudis want to show that 
they are looking after the Palestinians; Olmert is getting ready for 
the expected criticism from the right.... The question is whether 
there will also be a handshake, and how much that will cost Israel. 
" 
 
II. "Deja Vu" 
 
Columnist Meron Benvenisti wrote in the independent, left-leaning 
Ha'aretz (08/03): "It is hard to get over the feeling of Deja vu 
when facing the current political arena and public discourse.... 
After years of bloodshed that has brought the Palestinians only 
terrible disaster, Prime Minister Salam Fayad is returning to the 
formulas that his teacher and spiritual mentor Yasser Arafat 
declaimed when he was on the skids after the first Gulf War and was 
in desperate need of American aid.... It is possible to dismiss the 
value of statements from a weakened Palestinian government that 
needs all the help it can get from the Americans, and also from the 
occupying side. However, the clear formulations of those who head 
the Palestinian Authority leave no room for doubt: The circular path 
of time that characterizes this conflict has completed another 
circuit.  We are at the start of a 'peace process' like the one that 
occurred from 1993-2001 and all concerned will shake the dust off 
the messages of Oslo and its addenda.... What has been is not 
necessarily what will be, and the current 'process' will not 
necessarily end the way its predecessor did, in a new intifada.... 
The process of crushing the Palestinian people is pulling into its 
last station." 
 
III. "We'll Meet in October" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Dov Kontorer wrote in conservative 
Russian-language Vesty (08/02): "U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza 
Rice arrived in Jerusalem on August 1 and immediately started 
negotiations with Israeli officials.... The US initiative to 
(mediate) ... an [international] conference between Israeli and 
Palestinian leaders with participation of several Arab countries 
from the region is the [main] focus of current discussions.... 
President Bush's initiative suggests conducting an international 
Middle East Conference in this format guarantees the U.S. a dominant 
position in the political process in the region.  This 
[international peace conference] is expected to create a 'positive 
counterbalance' to the obvious failure of American policy in Iraq 
and the inability of the White House to stop nuclear weapon 
production in Iran."
