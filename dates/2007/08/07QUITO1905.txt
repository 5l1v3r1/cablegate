IMPLEMENTATION OF UNSC-IMPOSED SANCTIONS ON IRAN 
 
REF: STATE 101574 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On August 9, PolOff delivered reftel demarche to 
Lourdes Puma Puma, MFA Director General of Multilateral 
Affairs and provided Spanish copies of UNSCRs 1737 and 1747, 
as well as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) guidance 
paper on implementing targeted financial sanctions.  Puma 
said that she was aware of the requirement under the UNSCRs 
to submit an implementation report to the UNSC Iran Sanctions 
Committee.  She added that her office was responsible for 
completion and submission of the report and that it was in 
its final clearance stage.  When Poloff followed up on August 
17, Puma said that the required report was submitted on 
August 15. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Puma explained that the GOE's Commission on 
Financial Intelligence, created approximately a year ago, 
comprised of the GOE's National Security Council, Ministry of 
Defense and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was the governmental 
entity responsible for implementation of the GOE's financial 
sanctions.  Puma added that Ecuador was in favor of such 
sanctions as the GOE generally believes in disarmament, 
non-proliferation, and the "universalization of instruments 
of mass destruction."
