¶1. (SBU) Citing the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
as the clear instrument for all nuclear issues, including 
multilateral fuel issues, Riku Huttunen, Head of the Energy 
Administration and Nuclear Energy Division in the Finnish 
Ministry of Trade and Industry told econoff that Finland was 
not prepared to join GNEP at this time, preferring instead to 
remain an observer.  Although Huttunen said Finland values 
many aspects of GNEP, including its focus on 
non-proliferation and research into developing advanced 
technology, the Finns are concerned about any new 
organizations disrupting the existing open-market conditions 
for IAEA members to procure and process uranium.  Huttunen 
said Finland believes many &open issues8 need to be settled 
at the IAEA-level before being addressed in other fora. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Minister of Trade and Industry Mauri Pekkarinen will 
not attend the GNEP meeting or the IAEA meeting in Vienna in 
September.  Finland will likely be represented at the IAEA 
meetings by Kirsti Kauppi, its Ambassador to Austria.
