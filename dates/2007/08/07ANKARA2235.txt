SUBJECT: PRESIDENT GUL APPROVES PM ERDOGAN'S GOVERNMENT 
LIST FOR TURKEY'S 60TH GOVERNMENT 
 
 ¶1. (U)  Less than 24 hours after Abdullah Gul assumed the 
office of President, PM Erdogan submitted to Gul his proposed 
list for Turkey's 60th government.  Gul approved the list, 
which contains 25 names, up from 23 in the previous 
government.  It includes three Deputy Premiers/State 
Ministers who are intended to play a coordination role. 
Overall, the list is one of continuity and experience, 
retaining 17 familiar names, shifting around some portfolios 
and drawing in eight new ministers.  It is centrist, drawing 
in some names Erdogan had enticed onto the Justice and 
Development Party (AKP) election lists.  As with Erdogan's 
previous cabinet, the list contains one woman. 
 
¶2. (U) This marks only the second time in the history of the 
Turkish Republic that the same party has formed two 
consecutive single-party governments -- at the same time, it 
is a measure of the enormous responsibility AKP now assumes. 
 
¶3. (U) Ministerial names: 
 
--Prime Minister:  Recep Tayyip Erdogan

Hayati Yazici, Nazim Ekren

¶4.  (U) The new cabinet is set to meet for the first time at 
7 pm local.  AKP will read its government program in 
parliament on August 31 and plans to have a parliamentary 
vote of confidence on September 5.  Parliament will then 
recess until at least October 1.
