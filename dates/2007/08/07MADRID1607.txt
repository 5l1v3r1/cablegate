SUBJECT: SPAIN/GI PORTAL CONFERENCE: GOS WILL ENCOURAGE 
PARTNERS TO ATTEND BUT CANNOT PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING 
 
REF: STATE 114745 
 
Â¶1. Poloff delivered REFTEL request on August 16 to Ignacio 
Sanchez de Lerin, MFA DDG for Nonproliferation and Arms 
Control, to inquire whether Spain would be willing to conduct 
regional outreach with European GI partner nations to 
bolster attendance at the Garmisch conference.  Poloff also 
inquired if Spain would be willing and able to fund GI 
partner nation representatives to attend the meeting. 
Sanchez was on summer holiday but responded on August 21.  He 
said that his government would certainly lobby other partners 
to attend the GI Portal conference, but regretted that 
Spanish law does not allow the funding of foreign civil 
servants' travel unless covered by previous legal agreement. 
Sanchez said that he had looked into possibilities to bypass 
this regulation through extraordinary channels, but was not 
successful.  He said that Spain looks forward to a productive 
series of meetings at the end of the month.
