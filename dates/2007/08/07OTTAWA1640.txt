¶1. (U) Summary:  On August 25, Canada announced that it will 
substantially boost its development commitment to Kandahar 
province by providing C$45 million in support of five 
projects targeting health and community development.  The new 
projects build on major funding announced in February by 
Prime Minister Harper to accelerate the reconstruction and 
development process.  The finding will be allocated to the 
World Health Organization, the National Solidarity Program, 
the Kandahar Local Initiatives Program, UNICEF, and local 
NGOs and institutions in Kandahar.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (U) International Development Minister Bev Oda made the 
announcement while taking part in Afghan Independence Day 
celebrations in Toronto.  She said that "Canada's government 
is proud to stand beside the Afghan people as they strive to 
build better lives for themselves and secure a better future 
for their children.  Today's contribution will build on 
previous successes by supporting projects aiming to enhance 
health services and community development in Kandahar, one of 
the provinces in greatest need of our assistance." 
 
¶3. (U) Canada's strategy in Kandahar province focuses on 
responding to basic human needs, strengthening livelihoods, 
and increasing the capacity of local governments.  The 
funding will be allocated as follows: 
 
a) C$17.5 million to the World Health Organization (WHO) to 
help implement a national polio eradication initiative and 
a tuberculosis control program; 
 
b) C$10 million to the National Solidarity Program to build 
on the substantial results achieved to date in the areas of 
local governance and community development; 
 
c) C$5 million to the Kandahar Local Initiatives Program, 
which will support small-scale, quick action development and 
reconstruction initiatives that respond to immediate needs; 
 
d) C$10 million to UNICEF to help improve access to maternal 
and child health services in the southern region of the 
province, with a focus on Mirwais hospital in Kandahar City; 
and 
 
e) C$2.5 million for a rapid-response health intervention 
fund for local NGOs and institutions in Kandahar.
