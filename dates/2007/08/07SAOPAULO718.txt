Brazilian iron ore, minerals, and grains, and Brazil wants 
better access to the Chinese market.  Brazil is also seeking 
foreign investment, especially for infrastructure 
improvements, and Chinese companies have a desire to invest 
in this area as well.  While significant factors hinder an 
immediate wave of major PRC investment and activity, the 
Chinese tide appears to be coming. 
 
¶15. (C) The GoB and Brazilian industry express ambivalence 
about deepening economic relationships with China.  One of 
the factors in Brazil's reluctance to reduce the Swiss 
co-efficient factor during the current Doha discussions is 
what is perceived to be a threat to Brazilian industry from 
lower-cost Chinese imports (ref B-C).  Brazilian mining 
industry executives have told EmbOffs they are concerned 
about increasing Chinese influence over both natural 
resources and the distribution/transportation infrastructure 
needed to export these resources to distant markets.  In the 
future, they warned, the USG would need to pay greater 
attention to where its raw materials would come from, as 
China hopes to lock up both South America and Africa as its 
suppliers (ref D).
