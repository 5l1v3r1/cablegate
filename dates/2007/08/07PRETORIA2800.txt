¶1. (U) Central Methodist Church in downtown Johannesburg has 
become a haven for Zimbabweans fleeing the economic and 
political crisis in Zimbabwe.  PolOff visited the church 
August 1 and met with Bishop Paul Verynn, pastor of the 
church.  Verynn said that more than 1,000 people are staying 
in the church each night.  The crowded and dirty rooms of the 
large church facility are packed with bags, suitcases, 
mattresses, and blankets.  Verynn says that Zimbabwean 
migrants are sleeping in the stairwells and every corner of 
the church, so many that you literally cannot even enter the 
doorway of church at night. 
 
¶2. (U) As many as 20-30 new Zimbabweans arrive every day, 
part of an increasing migration of Zimbabweans fleeing to 
South Africa (ref A).  Verynn believes the church had a moral 
obligation to take in the migrants, although the visibly 
exhausted bishop noted that the church is bursting at the 
seams and will no longer be able to accept new "guests." 
 
¶3. (U) The church has become a virtual mini-city, with a 
clinic in a former office (a volunteer doctor visits twice a 
week) and a private school for students ranging from 6 to 60 
years old.  There are separate rooms for women and families, 
although the overwhelming majority of the church residents 
are young men (estimated ages 16-30) sent by their families 
to make money to send back home.  A grassroots Zimbabwean 
exile organization, Southern African Women's Institute for 
Migration Affairs (SAWIMA), has started a soup kitchen at the 
shelter three days a week, feeding 450 people per day. 
SAWIMA would like to expand the soup kitchen to feed all 
those in need five or six days a week, but currently does not 
have resources. 
 
¶4. (SBU) PolOff spoke with a sampling of the Zimbabweans 
living at the church, who recounted tales of economic 
hardship and desperation.  Several had arrived in the last 
few weeks, following the GOZ's freeze on prices and resulting 
commodity shortage.  A group of young men, who would not give 
their names, said they were former soldiers who were fed up 
with the low pay; one claimed there were 38 former soldiers 
staying at the church.  Another former soldier said he had 
come to South Africa because he feared for his life after he 
refused to beat up opposition leaders. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The overwhelming majority of Zimbabweans staying at 
the church do not have the legal right to live in South 
Africa.  They are considered by the South African Government 
as illegal economic migrants.  The SAG continues to deport 
hundreds of Zimbabweans each day to Beitbridge, Zimbabwe (ref 
B), many of whom cross into South Africa illegally again. 
The lack of legal status for the Zimbabweans makes it 
difficult for the church to seek SAG assistance for the 
migrants.  Recent press coverage of the church has led to 
some private donations from South Africans. 
 
¶6. (SBU) COMMENT:  The overcrowded Central Methodist Church 
is the most visible manifestation of an expanding Zimbabwean 
refugee/migration crisis in South Africa.  We suspect that a 
very large number of Zimbabweans are staying with family 
members or friends, or are crowding into shared apartments. 
While the total number of Zimbabweans living in South Africa 
is impossible to estimate with any accuracy, we believe the 
number crossing into South Africa is growing and that the 
rate will only increase as the economic crisis in Zimbabwe 
deepens.  Post looks forward to the planned PRM visit in 
September (ref C) and will continue to look for appropriate 
ways for the U.S. to assist.
