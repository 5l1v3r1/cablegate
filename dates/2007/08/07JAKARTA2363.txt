REF: A) JAKARTA 1690 B)STATE 111900 
 
¶1. (U)  We formally demarched on August 24, Director General of Sea 
Transportation, H. Harijogi, Secretary Ajiph Anwar, and Director of 
Sea Transport Djony Algemar that the U.S. has determined Indonesia 
is not significantly implementing the International Ship and Port 
Facility (ISPS) code.  Failure to address these deficiencies within 
90 days will lead to the U.S. imposing a Port Security Advisory 
(PSA) on non-compliant Indonesian ports. 
 
¶2. (U) The Director General expressed serious concern about the 
impact of a future PSA and the short time given for the far reaching 
improvements needed to avoid it.  The Director General stated that 
90 days is not enough time for the national level structural reforms 
that the Coast Guard requires as proof of significant ISPS 
implementation.  The DG requested an extension of the 90 day period 
to increase ISPS implementation.  We explained that the 90 day 
period is a limit imposed by U.S. law and, therefore, U.S. Coast 
Guard cannot grant an extension. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  We assured the Director General that there will not be a 
formal announcement on ISPS before the 90 days are over, but that we 
would quietly notify the American business community on this issue. 
[Note: Due to lingering ill feelings over the release of the EU 
Blacklist on June 28 without adequate consultation with the Ministry 
of Transportation, the Ministry is extremely sensitive about the 
public release of regulatory actions.  End Note.] 
 
¶4. (U)  The Director General stated that Indonesia's main focus will 
be increasing the number of exempted public ports and special 
facilities (crude oil ports, LNG terminals, etc.) as well as 
developing a national action plan to increase ISPS compliance.  The 
Director General asked for U.S. capacity building assistance to 
increase Indonesia's level of ISPS compliance and to decrease, "the 
gaps between American standards and Indonesian capacity".  We 
assured the Director General that the U.S. is committed to working 
together with Indonesia on this issue.
