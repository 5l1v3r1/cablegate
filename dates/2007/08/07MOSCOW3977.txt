¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a Pre-license check to determine 
the legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, TIE 
Peleng Ltd, Nizhny Novgorod, Russia. The company is 
listed on BIS license application D378720 as the 
ultimate consignee of 2 thermal imaging cameras. These 
items are controlled for national security and nuclear 
non-proliferation reasons under ECCN 6A003. The 
licensee is Bullard, 1898 Safety Way, Cynthiana, KY 
¶41031. 
 
¶3. On August 8, 2007, Export Control Attache Donald 
Pearce and FSN Natalya Shipitsina conducted a pre- 
license check at the offices of TIE Peleng Ltd, 176-A 
Gagarin Avenue, office 417, Nizhny Novgorod, Russia. 
The export control team met with Nikolay Tikhomirov, 
General Director. 
 
¶4. Peleng is a manufacturer of specialty fire vehicles 
and a distributor of firefighting equipment.  The 
company was established in 1995, and originally 
imported fire apparatus from Ukraine.  Since 1998 the 
company has specialized in the production of 16 types 
of heavy rescue, fireground support and specialized 
firefighting vehicles on Russian made chassis. Peleng 
sold 40 trucks in 2006. The company is also a 
distributor of firefighting equipment, imported from 
companies in France, Germany and the United States. 
Peleng is a distributor for Task Force Tips, a U.S. 
based manufacturer of nozzles and safety monitors. The 
company only deals with professional fire service 
organizations, which are under the command of the 
Ministry for Emergency Situations (Russian 
abbreviation MChS, also known by the acronym EMERCOM). 
Peleng employs 70 at two locations in Nizhny Novgorod: 
the main headquarters and a nearby fabrication 
facility. 
 
¶5. Peleng signed a distribution agreement with Bullard 
in June, and is ordering two cameras for use in 
product demonstration and training of firefighters. 
One application was filed for demonstration purposes, 
with a second filed for possible resale.  Mr. 
Tikhomirov is familiar with U.S. export control laws, 
and Bullard advised him on the expected conditions of 
the license.  Mr. Tikhomirov will be personally 
responsible for issuing out the equipment, which will 
be used by 7 employees. When not in use, the cameras 
will be stored in a security cage located in Mr. 
Tikhomirov's office.  The offices are guarded at all 
times by a private security company.  The security 
cage is alarmed, with a direct line to the local 
Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russian abbreviation 
MVD) Militia outpost.  NOTE:  The MVD Militia is the 
primary law enforcement organization of the Russian 
Federation.  END NOTE. 
 
¶6. Recommendations: Post recommends TIE Peleng Ltd, 
Nizhny Novgorod, Russia, as a reliable recipient of 
sensitive U.S. origin commodities. It is requested 
that post be notified of final disposition of the 
application, and of any shipments for this 
organization in order to conduct appropriate FCS 
follow-up and statistical reporting.
