SEMINAR 
 
REF: STATE 119645 
 
(SBU) On August 27, we delivered reftel points to Kadri 
Jogi, MFA Acting Director for Middle East Affairs, on 
the travel ban on Syrian activist Riad Seif.  Jogi 
thanked us for the information, but said given that 
Estonia has no diplomatic presence in Damascus, there is 
very little it can do to directly influence the 
Government of Syria (GOS) and that the MFA is unlikely 
to issue a public statement.  However, Jogi said, 
Estonia would support any action the EU takes on this 
issue.
