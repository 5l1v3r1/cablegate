CANDIDACY 
 
REF: STATE 115443 
 
¶1. (SBU) Econoff delivered reftel demarche on the U.S. 
candidacy to the Council of the International Civil Aviation 
Organization (ICAO) to Mr. Matti Tupamaki, Director of Air 
Transport at the Finnish Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). 
Although Tupamkaki did not explicitly say it, it was clear 
that, barring a major about face by the EU, Finland would 
support the U.S. candidacy.  Acknowledging they were not 
seeking to trade votes, Tupamaki then asked for U.S. support 
of the Nordic Delegation,s candidate from Iceland. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Tupamaki, who will represent Finland as a Delegate 
in Montreal, acknowledged the crucial importance of the U.S. 
in international aviation matters; however, he stopped short 
of voicing unconditional support for the U.S., stating that 
Finnish policy prohibits revealing support for candidates in 
advance.  However, Tupamaki said in order for ICAO to 
"function" the U.S. must be involved, and that Finland would 
give the U.S. candidacy their "most serious consideration." 
Tupamaki expressed surprise that candidacy questions were not 
discussed at all during the recent European Civil Aviation 
Conference meeting. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Finnish delegation to the ICAO Assembly will be 
led by Mr. Kim Salonen, Director of CAA.  Salonen previously 
served as a technical specialist in Montreal within the 
Nordic Delegation to ICAO.  Other Finnish participants at the 
Assembly include: 
Mr. Lars Lovkvist, Representative of Finland on the Council 
of ICAO (Alternative Chief Delegate) 
Mr. Reijo Lamberg, Director, Flight Operations and Licensing 
at CAA (Delegate) 
Mr. Matti Tupamaki, Director, Air Transport at CAA (Delegate) 
Mr. Johan Skjal, Head of Unit, Air Transport Policy (Delegate)
