¶1.  (SBU) Austrian Airlines' (AUA) International Relations Manager 
Bernadette Strobl-Wirz confirmed to us on August 27 that AUA had 
temporarily suspended its regularly-scheduled service to the 
northern Iraqi city of Irbil.  Strobl-Wirz said that the suspension 
was based on a security evaluation following the alleged missile 
attack on a Nordic Airways passenger plane departing Sulemaniya on 
August 9 (ref A). 
 
¶2.  (U) In an August 26 press statement announcing the suspension, 
AUA CEO Alfred Oetsch stressed that the security of passengers and 
colleagues remained AUA's top priority.  Oetsch added that AUA will 
decide whether or not to resume service following a thorough 
evaluation of the security situation. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) According to Strobl-Wirz, the Austrian Federal Economic 
Chamber, the Kurdish regional government, and Iraq's Ambassador to 
Austria have contacted AUA to register their concerns about the 
suspension of the Irbil flights.  AUA will meet with senior 
representatives of the regional government on August 28 to explain 
the suspension.  Strobl-Wirz promised to inform the Embassy of any 
further developments regarding its Irbil route. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) AUA inaugurated regularly-scheduled service to Irbil in 
December 2006 (ref B).  AUA has since expanded the twice-weekly 
Vienna-Irbil service to four flights per week to meet growing 
demand.  AUA told post that it now uses larger planes - Airbus 320s 
- on the route because of the higher volume, but also to increase 
range, should a security concern necessitate a diversion to another 
airport in the region.
