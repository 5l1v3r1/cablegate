¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY. At August 9 United Nations Security Council 
consultations, Department of Peacekeeping Operations 
Assistant-Secretary-General Hedi Annabi heralded the positive 
atmosphere at August 3-6 Arusha consultations, which 
represented the first meeting of all key leaders in the 
Darfur conflict since the signing of the Darfur Peace 
Agreement.  Annabi had no updates on the exact timing or 
venue of the planned final negotiations between the Darfur 
rebels and the Sudanese Government of National Unity, adding 
that more time was need for the rebels to "put flesh on the 
bones" of their common platform paper.  In response to 
Members' expressions of regret that Sudan Liberation Movement 
faction leader Abdelwahid al-Nur had been absent from Arusha, 
Annabi said his moment of truth would come when invitations 
to final negotiations were issued.  Annabi reported that UN 
Special Envoy Eliasson was currently in Darfur to discuss 
with tribal leaders, women's groups, refugees, IDPs and other 
civil society members ways to bring them into the political 
process, per the rebel platform.  Members agreed to a press 
statement issued by the Congolese Presidency after 
consultations welcoming UN and African Union efforts, calling 
for expedited negotiations and urging respect for the 
cease-fire; text in paragraph 7.  END SUMMARY. 
 
ANNABI DESCRIBED "ENABLING ENVIRONMENT" IN ARUSHA 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
¶2. (SBU) At August 9 United Nations Security Council (UNSC) 
consultations, Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) 
Assistant-Secretary-General (A/SYG) Hedi Annabi heralded the 
positive atmosphere at August 3-6 Ngurdoto, Arusha 
consultations, which represented the first meeting of all key 
leaders in the Darfur conflict since the signing of the 
Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA).  Annabi reported that the rebel 
groups JEM, SFDA, NMRD, SLM-Hamis and SLM-Unity were 
represented, but that SLM faction leader Abdelwahid al-Nur 
was absent.  Annabi said that field commanders also attended, 
as did representatives of regional players Chad, Egypt, 
Eritrea and Libya, whose participation he called constructive. 
 
¶3. (SBU) A/SYG Annabi outlined the five main areas discussed 
in Arusha: first, a common rebel negotiating platform; 
second, criteria for and level of participation in 
forthcoming negotiations; third, agenda and venue for 
forthcoming negotiations; fourth, participation of tribal 
leaders, women's groups, refugees, IDPs and civil society in 
forthcoming negotiations; and fifth, security and 
humanitarian matters.  Annabi said a workshop would precede 
final negotiations, which would address wealth- and 
power-sharing issues, security arrangements, land issues and 
humanitarian matters, based on agreements reached in Tripoli 
in July and under UNSCR 1769.  Annabi noted that the rebel 
platform paper was considered confidential for the time being 
but enumerated its key provisions: readiness to respect UN-AU 
leadership in the political process, readiness to respect the 
cease-fire as long as all other parties to the Darfur 
conflict did the same, willingness to keep the platform open 
to absentees, commitment to unhindered humanitarian access, 
acceptance of UNSCR 1769 (2007) and its implementation, and 
willingness to address the concerns of all negotiating 
parties through the appropriate mechanisms (Annabi noted the 
Darfur-Darfur Dialogue and Consultation could be used for 
this purpose). 
 
¶4. (SBU) A/SYG Annabi attributed international community 
support, especially that of the Government of Tanzania, for 
the success in Arusha.  He urged the UNSC to remain engaged, 
particularly with the AU, in the run-up to final negotiations 
between the rebels and the Sudanese Government of National 
Unity (GNU).  Annabi noted that while the GNU had welcomed 
the Arusha conclusions, it had reiterated its objections to a 
"wholesale re-negotiation" of  the DPA.  Annabi stressed that 
all parties must adopt an attitude of "mutual accommodation 
and compromise" for final negotiations, adding that 
Abdelwahid's moment of truth would come when the final 
invitations were eventually issued.  Annabi said that 
Eliasson would be on the ground in Darfur to consult with 
relevant stakeholders in all three Darfur states and that AU 
Envoy Salim would pick up in Khartoum during the week of 
August 13.

MEMBERS COMMEND ENVOYS, CASTIGATE ABDELWAHID 
-------------------------------------------- 
¶5. (SBU) Members were unanimous in their congratulations to 
the UN and AU Envoys for their successful efforts in Arusha. 
Many Members (including South Africa) also paid tribute to 
the Darfur rebel movements for coming forward out of respect 
for the consultative process in Arusha.  Members were 
impatient for next steps, stressing that the date for final 
negotiations not slip beyond the two- to three-month window 
elaborated by the rebels.  Khartoum's allies (including 
Indonesia, Qatar and Russia) spoke in its defense, stressing 
that its "encouraging" response to Arusha not be left 
unnoticed and that the DPA not be re-opened in negotiations 
to come. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Most Members expressed regret that Abdelwahid was 
absent from Arusha talks and called on those with appropriate 
influence to encourage him to join the political process. 
Ghanaian PermRep Christian expressed hope that SLA 
humanitarian coordinator Suleiman Jamous could participate in 
final negotiations and called on the GNU to bring him on 
board.  Russian PermRep Churkin and the Qatari delegate 
suggested in their interventions that Abdelwahid's failure to 
participate in Arusha talks contravened UNSCR 1769 and AU-UN 
Roadmap obligations, with Churkin asking about measures to be 
taken in response.  Members also called for respect for the 
cease-fire, with the Indonesian PermRep citing the August 8 
incident in Adila as a violation.  In response to Ambassador 
Sanders' request for further clarification on the Adila 
incident, A/SYG Annabi reiterated media reports that Darfur 
rebels claimed to have shot down a Sudanese MiG-29 about 2km 
south of Adila in the eastern corner of South Darfur, a town 
where during the week of July 30 the GNU had accused JEM 
rebels of an attack.  Annabi noted speculation that the GNU 
acted now in retribution for the JEM attack but said so far 
the GNU had made no official comment. 
 
¶7. (SBU) At UK suggestion (to stave off an original South 
African request for a Presidential Statement), Members agreed 
to a press statement to be delivered after consultations by 
the Congolese Presidency.  The text of the statement was 
issued as Security Council document SC/9094 and read as 
follows: "The members of the Security Council welcome the 
substantial progress made by the Special Envoys (Jan Eliasson 
for the United Nations and Salim Ahmed Salim for the African 
Union) at Arusha on Darfur.  That progress builds on the 
momentum generated by the meeting held in Tripoli on 13 July 
2007 and the adoption of Security Council resolution 1769 
(2007).  The Council continues to stress the importance of 
pursuing the political and peacekeeping tracks 
simultaneously.  The members of the Security Council now call 
on all parties to move from pre-negotiations to negotiations 
as soon as possible and to demonstrate their commitment to 
the political process through concrete actions, in particular 
a cessation of hostilities.  The members also call on all key 
movement leaders to enter and participate in the AU-UN 
process."
