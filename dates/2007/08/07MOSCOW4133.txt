¶1.  As requested reftel, EST contacted the Department of Natural 
Resources to determine who was expected to represent Russia at the 
September 12-13 BSEC Symposium in Istanbul, as no names of 
recommended invitees were provided by Department.  We were informed 
that Ms. Natalya Tretyakova, Department for International 
Cooperation, Ministry of Natural Resources, would most likely 
attend.

official to invite, and will pass information directly to EUR/PGI 
when available.
