¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel 1 requested a Post-shipment verification to 
determine the legitimacy and reliability of the end- 
user, JSC Institute Engineering Science Ural Branch 
RAS, Yekaterinburg, Russia. The company is listed on 
BIS license application D352204 as the ultimate 
consignee of a thermal imager, model: TH9100.  This 
item is controlled for national security and regional 
stability reasons under ECCN 6A003. The licensee is 
Mikron Infrared Inc., 16 Thornton Road, Oakland, NJ, 
¶07436. 
 
¶3. On August 21, 2007, Export Control Attache Donald 
Pearce and FSN Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested post-shipment verification with Joint Stock 
Company Institute Engineering Science Ural Branch, 
Russian Academy of Science, 34 Komsomolskaya St., 
Yekaterinburg, Russia. The export control team met 
with Sergey Smirnov, Deputy Director. 
 
¶4. The Institute was founded in 1986 as a division of 
the Urals branch of the Russian Academy of Science 
(RAS).  The institute focuses on fundamental research 
in topics such as mechanical engineering, machine 
construction, transportation, and information 
technology systems.  The Joint Stock Company conducts 
research and development for private clients wishing 
to utilize the design and mechanical experience of the 
faculty of the Institute.  Funding for the Institute 
is provided by RAS and from the profits of the JSC. 
The Institute employs 180, including 80 researchers 
and professors on staff. 
 
¶5. The commodity in reftel is used in the study of 
machine and mechanical systems.  The camera allows 
researchers to precisely map thermal stress and 
friction points in a machine or device, and allows for 
a careful examination of the failure of devices to 
improve design and fabrication of parts.  The camera 
allows the researcher to observe the destruction of 
parts, in real time, while noting the dynamics of the 
failing device. The purchase of the camera was funded 
by a government grant to RAS. 
 
¶6. The team was shown an NEC Thermo-Tracer TH 9100WL, 
serial number 6021101.  When not in use the camera is 
stored in a safe located on the fifth floor.  Mr. 
Smirnov is personally responsible for the camera, 
issuing it to the operators when required.  Along with 
Mr. Smirnov, there are two other operators who are 
trained and authorized to use the camera.  Mr. Smirnov 
is familiar with the conditions of the license. 
 
¶7. Recommendations: Post recommends JSC Institute 
Engineering Science Ural Branch RAS, Yekaterinburg, 
Russia as reliable recipients of sensitive U.S. origin 
commodities.
