SUBJECT:  BELIZE-VENEZUELA:  NEW BRV AMBASSADOR TO BELIZE 
 
REF:  BELMOPAN 495 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  With timing perhaps linked to Prime Minister Musa's visit 
to Venezuela for the PetroCaribe Summit, the BRV Embassy in Belize 
circulated on August 14 an announcement that the Mission's Charge 
d'Affaires, Roberto J. Dubuc, was being transferred to the Internal 
Service in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and had left Belize 
August 9.  According to the note the new Ambassador will be Omar 
Valdiviezo, date of arrival not specified. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Last fall the GoB announced that it was naming Sarkis 
Abou-Nehra as non-resident Ambassador to Venezuela.  The government 
has no plans that we are aware of to name a resident Ambassador to 
Caracas. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  COMMENT:  Dubuc has been the Invisible Man of the 
diplomatic corps for some time, seldom seen and rarely heard from. 
Our assumption is that he is being replaced by someone who will give 
the BRV a higher profile here to go with the largesse that the BRV 
has been providing Belize recently (reftel).  Unfortunately for us, 
the plot of land in Belmopan allocated to Venezuela for a new 
Embassy is directly across the street from our Consular Section 
entrance.  END COMMENT.
