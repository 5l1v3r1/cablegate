REF: BUENOS AIRES 1685 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR E. ANTHONY WAYNE FOR REASONS 1.4(B) AND (D) 
 
¶1.  (C)  Ambassador asked Argentine Minister of the Interior 
(MOI) Anibal Fernandez August 27 about his views on dealing 
with terrorist threats and other serious problems in the 
Tri-border area (TBA).  He asked the Ministe his views on 
the potential benefits of addressing a broader scope of 
issues in the 3   1 Working Group.   MOI Fernandez reacted 
positively, indicating that the GOA was open to discussing 
"any pertinent issues."   MOI Fernandez acknowledged that 
problems of terrorism, narcotics, arms trafficking, 
trafficking in persons, and money laundering are often 
interrelated and that the same groups are often involved in 
many of these activities at the same time. 
 
¶2.  (C)  MOI Fernandez was also candid about the challenges 
of working in the TBA.   Argentina has a good working 
relationship with Brazil on these issues and sees Brazil as a 
valuable and serious partner.  Paraguay, alternatively, is 
not a reliable partner.  MOI Fernandez referred to Paraguay 
as a "plastic" country, with institutions that are much less 
than what they seem, and fraudulent documents readily 
available.  He urged caution in dealing with Paraguayan 
authorities.  He also acknowledged, however, that Paraguay is 
the source of many of the problems in the TBA region, so that 
its role in regional TBA efforts, including the 3   1 
mechanism, was critically important. 
 
¶3.  (C)  The Ambasador also noted recent reports of numerous 
unauthorized flights entering Argentine air space, 
particularly in the TBA.   MOI Fernandez acknowledged the 
problem, particularly as it relates to the entry of narcotics 
into the country, and the paucity of the GOA's response. 
Dismissing Argentine radar as "artisinal" ("hand- made"), he 
complained that Argentina does not have the contemporaty 
radar technology needed to aggressively confront the issue. 
He also noted that the corruption on both the Argentine and 
Paraguayan sides of the border make this a particularly 
difficult problem.
