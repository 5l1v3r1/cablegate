This cable was coordinated with Congen Istanbul. 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: Turkey's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) 
held on July 10 an after action review of the Black Sea 
Economic Cooperation (BSEC) 15th Anniversary Summit in 
Istanbul on June 25.  Deputy Director General for 
Multilateral Affairs Ahmet Asim Arar chaired the meeting, and 
representatives from the Embassies of BSEC member and 
observer countries noted the Summit's success, under Turkey's 
chairmanship, in increasing BSEC's profile with the 
participation of 11 heads of state or government and in 
moving BSEC to a project-based orientation. We called 
attention to the September 12-13 symposium, "Environmental 
Protection for Economic Growth Best Practices," and invited 
BSEC members and observers to fully participate. There were 
discussions on preliminary plans for the next BSEC 
ministerial to be held in Turkey on 25 October 2007, during 
which Turkey will transfer chairmanship to Ukraine. End 
summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Turkey's DDG for Multilateral Affairs Ahmet Asim 
Arar opened the meeting by offering thanks to member 
countries and observers for their support in making the 
Istanbul Summit a success. In particular, the participation 
of eleven heads of state or government (Armenia was 
represented by FM Oskanian) boosted BSEC's profile in member 
countries and in the media.  Arar stressed the success of the 
Turkish chairmanship in extending observer status to 
the EU, moving forward on BSEC reform, and transitioning BSEC 
to a more project-based focus, most notably with the Black 
Sea Ring Highway and the Motorway of the Seas.  Arar also 
noted BSEC's potential to take on a greater political role in 
the region,especially in resolving the Frozen Conflicts. 
 
¶3. (SBU) There was consensus among speakers (Germany, Serbia, 
the UN, Georgia, Italy, the U.S., and Greece) about the 
success of the Summit under Turkey's chairmanship and the 
importance of BSEC's new project-based focus.  The Serbian 
and Georgian representatives brought up a few of the Summit's 
logistical problems, which ultimately did not affect the 
Summit's substance.  The German representative raised the 
issue of better communication of administrative issues to 
observer countries.  The UN representative expressed hope 
that BSEC's new project-based orientation will allow greater 
cooperation within BSEC and will produce bigger results. The 
Serbian representative also echoed Arar's statement regarding 
BSEC's capacity to address political issues like the Frozen 
Conflicts. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Turkey's MFA looks forward to the next ministerial 
summit in October, during which Turkey will transfer 
chairmanship of BSEC to Ukraine.  Arar raised the issue of 
financial resources, and he explained the location of the 
summit, originally planned for Ankara, may shift to the more 
affordable and touristic Turkish city of Bodrum. 
 
¶5. (SBU) We congratulated Turkey and BSEC for a successful 
Anniversary Summit. Referring to Ambassador Wilson's remarks 
at BSEC, we said the U.S. welcomes the opportunity to invite 
participants from all member and observer countries to the 
September 12-13 symposium, "Environmental Protection for 
Economic Growth Best Practices." We added that it is our hope 
for active participation from all member and observer 
countries and for a successful sharing of best practices in 
environmental practices. 
 
¶6. (SBU) In a follow-up visit with MFA Department of 
Multilateral Affairs Head Hatun Demirer, the MFA confirmed 
receiving the BSEC Symposium Draft Agenda and Proposal on 
June 23. We provided her with 
a more up to date draft agenda listing several confirmed 
speakers as well as recommended speakers.  Demirer explained 
that she will be making written requests to the Turkish 
Environment and Forestry Ministry calling attention to the 
draft Symposium agenda and requesting participants from the 
Ministry. We discussed the program which includes Turkish 
speakers from the Government, private sector, civil society, 
and academia. We commented that the Symposium will be an 
 
ANKARA 00002003  002 OF 002 
 
 
important opportunity to highlight Turkey's regional 
leadership in environmental protection and will be attended 
by a senior USG representative. Demirer was pleased with the 
agenda. We stressed the urgency of receiving Turkish input so 
that invitations can be sent and the agenda finalized. 
Demirer agreed to move forward quickly and provide guidance 
to Embassy Ankara regarding the agenda and the names of 
participating GOT officials. 
 
¶7. (SBU) On July 17 BSEC circulated to BSEC member states and 
observers a GOT diplomatic note dated July 13 conveying our 
draft program of events for the symposium.  We will continue 
to work with both GOT officials and the BSEC Secretariat on 
the organization of this conference.
