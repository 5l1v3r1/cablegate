SUBJECT: EMBASSY TEL AVIV CONTACTS GOI TO REQUEST URGENT 
ASSISTANCE WITH DISPOSITION OF 46 AFRICAN MIGRANTS RESCUED 
AT SEA BY USN 
 
REF: SECSTATE 116313 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) DCM Luis Moreno conveyed reftel request for 
assistance to Alon Ushpiz, head of the Foreign Ministry's 
Bureau of Coordination.  (Ushpiz is equivalent of Deputy 
Director General to Foreign Ministry Director General Aaron 
Abramovich.)  Following internal GOI discussion, Ushpiz 
informed DCM that there would likely be a "positive" response 
from the Prime Minister's Office in regard to the issue. 
Ushpiz went on to say that this "tendency to be positive" was 
dependent on USG responsibility for the final settlement of 
the migrants, and that it would be a one shot deal that would 
not be repeated.  (Comment: The "positive" remark was perhaps 
an implied counterpoint to critics of Israeli refugee policy, 
especially mounting media and NGO pressure regarding Sudanese 
asylum seekers.  End comment.)  Ushpiz also stressed that the 
migrants would be held in a military base and although 
treated humanely, would not have luxurious quarters. 
However, when Ushpiz contacted the DCM later in the day, 
after the matter had reached the Prime Minister's office, he 
apologetically informed the DCM that the GOI had turned down 
the request.  Ushpiz did not offer specific reasons why the 
GOI had, counter to his earlier optimism, decided not to 
respond positively to this request for assistance.
