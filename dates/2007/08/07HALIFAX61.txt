SUBJECT: NEWFOUNDLAND-LABRADOR PREMIER ANNOUNCES MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR 
DEAL ON FOURTH OFFSHORE OIL FIELD 
 
 
¶1. SUMMARY:  Newfoundland-Labrador will see a much-welcome new 
offshore oil development project now that Premier Danny Williams 
has worked out a deal on the Hebron project.  With an 
anticipated 400-700 million barrels of oil, Hebron promises to 
be a massive boost for the province, both for the local economy 
and for a Premier who is moving towards a re-election bid.  END 
SUMMARY 
 
¶2.  Newfoundland-Labrador Premier Danny Williams announced in a 
press conference on August 22 that his government reached an 
agreement for the development of Hebron-Ben Nevis, the fourth 
oil field to be developed off his province.  While not revealing 
the entire contents of the Memorandum of Understanding with the 
project's owners -- Chevron, ExxonMobil, Petro-Canada and 
Norsk-Hydro -- the Premier said the province will purchase a 4.9 
percent equity stake in Hebron at a cost of C$100 million. 
Williams also said the province will receive more than C$16 
billion in royalty payments over 25 years, with the federal 
government getting C$7 billion.  As with the Hibernia project, 
the developers will use a gravity-based structure (GBS) versus 
the floating platform which is in use in the Terra Nova and 
White Rose developments.  The GBS will generate significantly 
more economic spin-offs than the floating systems, a welcome 
boost for Newfoundland-Labrador which suffers from Canada's 
highest unemployment rates. 
 
¶3.  Summary of the Hebron Offshore Oil Field Project: 
 
--Type: Heavy oil 
--Location: Jeanne d'Arc Basin, 350 km southeast of St. John's 
--Estimated Reserves: 400-700 million barrels 
--Operator: Chevron Canada Resources 
--Detailed Geological Information: 
http://www.nr.gov.nl.ca/mines%26en/oil/ 
--History: Discovered in 1980, Hebron was first deemed 
non-commercial before three appraisal wells drilled in 1999 - 
2000 yielded promising results. In February 2002, after a 
two-year evaluation, the project was considered too expensive 
and technically difficult to develop using existing technology. 
Then in 2004 an air of optimism surrounded the development when 
Chevron hired a project manager and opened an office in St. 
John's. That optimism was further fueled in April 2005 when 
Chevron and partners signed a Joint Operating Agreement with the 
aim of advancing the evaluation of the project. Momentum built 
with the joint evaluation focusing on a Gravity Based Structure 
(GBS) concept similar to Hibernia.   Attention then turned to 
working out a development agreement with the provincial 
government. 
 
¶4.  Comment:  As widely reported in the national media, Williams 
had broken off talks with the Hebron partners in the spring of 
2006 over his stance that the province would not receive enough 
benefits from the development.  The Premier resurrected 
negotiations earlier this summer in a move which pundits were 
quick to link to the upcoming provincial election on October 9. 
The announcement of a deal may pave the way for what pollsters 
are predicting will be a cakewalk election victory for the 
Premier.  Williams has enjoyed unprecedented and consistently 
high rates of support from the electorate, leading even some 
Liberal party foes to publicly predict that their party is going 
to face near annihilation at the hands of Danny Williams and his 
Tory party. Nonetheless, Liberal Opposition leader Gerry Reid 
was quick off the mark in his reaction to the news of the MOU, 
speculating that the Premier did not reveal more specifics of 
the deal due to political expediency rather than proprietary 
business information.  Reid predicted in a press interview that 
the electorate will not hear the full details of the deal until 
after the election.  Regardless of the political ramifications, 
this announcement is welcome news to the province's offshore 
industry which had been very concerned on what the future might 
have held without the Hebron deal.  End comment
