¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY. In an August 1 meeting of P5 Ambassadors, 
Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) 
Under-Secretary-General Guehenno solicited P5 bilateral 
engagement with the Sudanese Government of National Unity 
(GNU) on the issue of GNU restrictions on movement of goods 
and flight clearances that are hindering the deployment of 
assets to Darfur.  Chinese Permanent Representative (PR) Wang 
urged that the problem be treated as a "technical," vice 
"political," issue that should be addressed through the 
Tripartite Mechanism (the United Nations, the African Union 
and the GNU).  Russian PR Churkin suggested that the 
Secretary-General send a letter to President Bashir 
 
SIPDIS 
congratulating him on the adoption of UNSCR 1769 and raising 
the concerns Guehenno mentioned, a proposal agreed to by 
other P5 Members.  UK PR Jones Parry and Ambassador Sanders 
noted that the timetable for Darfur deployment should not be 
allowed to be pushed back on account of this type of GNU 
activity, activity against which UNSCR 1769 was designed to 
protect.  Jones Parry requested a briefing during the week of 
August 6 by the UN technical team returning from 
consultations with the African Union (AU) on outstanding 
aspects of hybrid preparations, and both Jones Parry and 
Ambassador Sanders conveyed the willingness of London and 
Washington to assist in filling in the blanks with these 
preparations.  END SUMMARY. 
 
UN OUTLINES CONCERNS 
-------------------- 
¶2. (SBU) In an August 1 meeting of P5 Ambassadors, DPKO 
Under-Secretary-General (U/SYG) Guehenno solicited P5 
bilateral engagement with the GNU on the issue of GNU 
restrictions on movement of goods and flight clearances that 
are hindering the deployment of assets to Darfur.  Guehenno 
warned that if left unchecked, these "difficulties" caused by 
the GNU would prevent the effective deployment of necessary 
materiel and personnel to Darfur and would disrupt the 
timetable for deployment called for in UNSCR 1769.  In the 
area of movement of goods, Guehenno cited the 2.2 percent 
surcharge levied by the Sudanese Seaport Corporation on the 
import of goods through Port Sudan, which had resulted in the 
holding since May of $39 million worth of UNMIS materiel 
(some of which was necessary for the construction of 
accommodations for incoming UN personnel) destined for 
Darfur.  However, Department of Field Support (DFS) Acting 
Chief de Chambord warned that even if the materiel were 
released imminently, it would set the timetable back by at 
least one month, given the volume of the cargo detained, 
which includes 646 20-foot containers, 18,000 metric tons of 
fuel and 200 light vehicles.  De Chambord added that two 
cargo shipments from the UN Humanitarian Response Depot in 
Brindisi are also blocked and that two flights from Brindisi 
containing $300,000 worth of communications equipment had 
been diverted to Entebbe, Uganda, to avoid losing this cargo 
capacity, as well. 
 
¶3. (SBU) U/SYG Guehenno noted that the UN had raised this 
issue repeatedly but to no avail with the GNU: Notes Verbales 
were sent on May 22 and June 21, and the issue was also 
raised through the Tripartite Mechanism in meetings on June 
23 and July 25.  Guehenno said that the Foreign Ministry had 
assured the UN that it would address the issue, but that the 
Ministry of Finance is truly the key player.  Guehenno noted 
the recent receipt of a letter from the Sudanese Ministry of 
Finance assuring the UN that it would address the issue of 
releasing these goods, a letter that DPKO considered a good 
sign.  Guehenno warned that leaving such bureaucratic matters 
unaddressed for too long would have negative consequences for 
the UN. 
 
¶4. (SBU) On the issue of flight clearances, U/SYG Guehenno 
reported the GNU required separate clearances for materiel 
earmarked for the AU Mission in the Sudan (AMIS) and for the 
Heavy Support Package (HSP) of UN assistance to AMIS, a 
procedure that is slowing down delivery.  DFS Acting Chief de 
Chambord elaborated that the Sudanese aviation authority is 
also boarding UN aircraft arbitrarily and asking contractors 
to disembark.  He said the GNU permitted the UN no night 
flight capacity (critical in the event of medical 
evacuations), no permanent positioning of aircraft in Darfur, 
and no landing of any aircraft larger than an Ileutian 76, 
which is problematic since the UN traditionally uses 
Antonov-74 aircraft for early deployment of personnel.  De 
Chambord told the P5 that another related problem was the 
Sudanese Armed Forces' (SAF) assumption of control of 
 
 
airports in Darfur after 1800h, when the SAF performed work 
on all aircraft there, including those of AMIS. 
 
P5 REACTION 
----------- 
¶5. (SBU) Chinese Permanent Representative PR Wang urged that 
the problem be treated as a "technical," vice "political," 
issue that should be addressed through the Tripartite 
Mechanism (the United Nations, the African Union and the 
GNU).  He suggested that the Tripartite Mechanism meet more 
frequently, perhaps on a daily basis, to pre-empt such 
issues.  Guehenno responded that the Sudanese mindset with 
regard to the Tripartite Mechanism needed to change, since 
the GNU sees the body as a approving/vetting mechanism, 
whereas the UN considers it simply a "facilitating" body. 
Wang further warned against allowing this issue to upset the 
political momentum generated by adoption of UNSCR 1769 and 
agreed to revert to Beijing on how bilateral contacts could 
be strengthened to address the issue.  Wang urged the P5 not 
to use the Security Council "in a public way" on this issue. 
Russian PR Churkin suggested that the Secretary-General send 
a letter to President Bashir congratulating him on the 
adoption of UNSCR 1769 and raising the concerns Guehenno 
mentioned, a proposal supported by other P5 Members. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Ambassador Sanders and the UK and French 
representatives urged caution, however, pointing out that 
this recurring pattern of resistance by the GNU is especially 
worrying in the afterglow of UNSCR 1769 adoption.  UK PR 
Jones Parry and Ambassador Sanders asserted that the 
timetable for Darfur deployment should not be allowed to be 
pushed back on account of this type of GNU activity, activity 
against which UNSCR 1769 was designed to protect.  Jones 
Parry suggested using UNSCR 1769 as the "hook" for engaging 
the Sudanese on this issue in the SYG's letter to President 
Bashir, portraying the raising of the matter as an 
appropriate response to the provisions of the resolution, 
rather than as recrimination for Sudanese bad behavior. 
 
¶7. (SBU) UK PR Jones Parry requested a briefing during the 
week of August 6 by the UN technical team returning from 
consultations with the African Union (AU) on outstanding 
aspects of hybrid preparations, and both Jones Parry and 
Ambassador Sanders conveyed the intent of London and 
Washington to assist in filling in the blanks with these 
preparations.  The UN seeks to confirm troop- and 
police-contributing countries' contributions for the hybrid 
operation by August 15.
