Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) On August 3, as part of the Ninth Meeting of the 
High Level Consultative Commission (HLCC) on 
Telecommunications, Rafael del Villar, Under Secretary for 
Communications at the Secretariat of Communications and 
Transportation (SCT), briefed a small group of Department of 
State (DOS), Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and 
Department of Commerce (DOC) officials on Mexican President 
Felipe Calderon's telecommunications policy.  SCT Secretary 
Luis Tellez Kuenzler joined the meeting and supported del 
Villar's assertions.  Del Villar emphasized that SCT's 
primary concern is the lack of penetration of landline 
telephone and broadband services.  Among other proposals, del 
Villar suggested that while participating in the upcoming 
Security and Prosperity Partnership in Canada, the three 
Leaders propose to dramatically lower long distance 
interconnection rates to make calling within North America 
within reach for even the poorest citizens.  With the "social 
good" argument as a backbone, it appears that the SCT and 
possibly the Calderon Government may try to tackle the 
Mexican telecom monopoly, Telmex's dominance in the sector. 
End Summary. 
 
Clarifying Roles in the Sector 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Summarizing the current state of Mexico's telecom 
sector, del Villar said the Calderon administration will seek 
to clarify the roles SCT, the Federal Telecommunications 
Commission (Cofetel), and the Federal Competition Commission 
(Cofeco) play in the sector.  He highlighted the political 
role of the SCT as a planning and policy body with the power 
to decide which radio frequency bands will be auctioned and 
when.  He stated that, for the first time since 1990 (when 
Telmex was privatized), the SCT is more willing to support 
competition and openness than the regulator (Cofetel), a 
situation he termed a "political anomaly."  Also, for the 
first time in Mexican history, the President is keenly aware 
of the important issues facing the telecom sector and is 
creating a political climate that is conducive to moving 
forward with telecom policy.  He pointed out that Cofetel is 
a part of the SCT (and hence Executive Branch) and not an 
independent regulator like the FCC in the U.S.  He also 
stressed that the SCT currently enjoys an excellent working 
relationship with Cofeco. 
 
Social Good Argument 
-------------------- 
 
3.(SBU)  Del Villar observed that the rural areas of Mexico 
have been devastated by migration.  He cited "heroic 
families" in which the husband travels to the U.S. to work to 
send money home, yet his wife is left in Mexico, unable to 
call her husband in the U.S. because of prohibitively high 
telecommunication rates.  High fixed and mobile 
interconnection rates; the lack of unlimited calling plans; 
and the need for technology to decrease overall telecom costs 
drive SCT telecom policy.  He reiterated Mexico's commitment 
to "Calling Party Pays," but also his concern with the level 
of tariffs.  He might seek to implement a "Bill and Keep" 
regime in mobile telephony in Mexico in which each network 
agrees to terminate calls from the other network at no 
charge. Cofetel is in the process of developing its 
Fundamental Technical Plan for Interconnection and is holding 
a second period for public comment that ends August 10. 
 
Broadband Penetration Lacking 
----------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU)   Del Villar suggested possible policy changes to 
promote broadband penetration in Mexico. Broadband network 
"unbundling" would foster increased network investment by 
outside players.   Del Villar added that Mexico would label 
this proposal "leasing of the last mile" to avoid any 
 
MEXICO 00004334  002 OF 003 
 
 
negative stigma.  He noted that while this policy would be 
tough to implement, it was nonetheless being considered 
because SCT has not seen sufficient investment by Telmex in 
its network. Second, he suggested that Mexico allow the 
resale of broadband in the marketplace.  Third, because 
approximately twenty-six percent of Mexican mobile users do 
not have access to a fixed line, he would like broadband to 
be offered on a stand-alone basis instead of solely with a 
package.  Last, he suggested one option for Mexico might be 
public-private partnerships in which the government might be 
the owner of spectrum that is operated by a local government 
or community mechanism.  Mexico, he continued, has the 
spectrum available to do this with the ultimate goal being 
increased rural access to the Internet. 
 
Broadcasting Sector in the Hands of the President 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶5. (SBU)    Throughout the conversation, del Villar was 
careful to reiterate that he was referring only to Mexican 
telecommunications policy, not broadcasting.  Because of the 
political fallout that licensing a third broadcasting network 
would cause, the decision on whether to move forward rests 
with President Calderon.  Del Villar did mention that through 
changes in the existing licenses of current broadcasters, the 
Government may impose a "must carry / must offer" policy.  He 
noted SCT fears Telmex collusion with Televisa in the video 
services market to secure cheap content, while squeezing out 
other smaller potential competitors. 
 
Spectrum Negotiations 
--------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU)  The U.S. and Mexican delegations also held spectrum 
negotiations during a three-day HLCC working level meeting 
(July 31-August 2) immediately prior to the Ninth HLCC on 
August 3.  As a result, at the Ninth HLCC the principals 
signed three documents:(A)A Permanent Protocol concerning the 
allotment and use of the 138-144 MHz band for terrestrial 
non-broadcasting radio communication services along the 
U.S.-Mexican border; (B)  A Joint Statement of the principals 
at the Ninth HLCC; and (C) A Directory of Bilateral Issues 
for 2007-2009 (DBI).  In terms of ongoing negotiations to 
reconfigure the allotment plan of the 800 MHz band, del 
Villar noted that the SCT is actively engaged in negotiations 
with Nextel Mexico and Intercomunicacion del Pacifico, a 
subsidiary of Telmex, the two most affected Mexican carriers. 
The SCT also requested assistance from the FCC in determining 
a realistic cost for network carrier actions to relocate the 
affected Mexican carriers within the 800 MHz band as well as 
to move them to an alternate  band. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) On the topic of increasing broadband penetration by 
means of near-term spectrum auctions, (para.4 above), in the 
three-day working level meeting, SCT and Cofetel officials 
pressed U.S. representatives to identify additional radio 
bands suitable for broadband applications and place them in 
the DBI so that new cross-border sharing agreements could be 
reached.  These bands included:  420-450 MHz, 698-806 MHz 
("700 MHz"), 2300-2400 MHz and 3300-3700 MHz bands.  All of 
these bands were included in the DBI except the 2300-2400 MHz 
which will be discussed informally in upcoming HLCC working 
level teleconferences.  (The U.S. and Mexico currently have 
an agreement in place for the 2310-2360 MHz band for the 
Digital Audio Radio Satellite Service used extensively by 
U.S. providers XM Satellite Radio and Sirius Satellite 
Radio).  SCT and Cofetel also mentioned their interest in 
amending the existing Protocol for Personal Communications 
Services in the 1850-1990 MHz band to also support wireless 
broadband. 
 
The three HLCC documents that were signed will be posted 
shortly on the Department's public website at : 
http://www.state.gov/e/eeb/cip/c622.htm. 
 
Improvements for Cross Border Security Communications 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶8.  (SBU)  Representatives of Mexico's Secretariat of Public 
 
MEXICO 00004334  003 OF 003 
 
 
Safety (SSP) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security 
reported in the working level meeting that the HLCC Security 
Communications Task Group plans to complete its Plan for the 
Long Term Solution for Cross Border Security Communications 
shortly and submit the Plan to the HLCC for adoption.  The 
Plan reportedly includes establishment of six cross border 
microwave links in the 7-8.5 GHz band that will allow voice, 
data and video intercommunications between communications 
centers of law enforcement agencies on both sides.   In the 
principals meeting, DOS also mentioned the need for a second 
phase of the "Long Term Solution" that would address 
reciprocal licensing for mobile and portable equipment of 
public safety agencies on both sides as well as improving 
mutual-aid communications for specific individual public 
safety agencies on each side.    These are the continuing 
actions described in reftel, and the Plan will be distributed 
to border consulates when completed. 
 
Del Villar Proposes a North America-wide Calling Area 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶9. (SBU)  Lowering interconnection rates is high on SCT's 
agenda, justified to the public and the industry by the 
"social good" argument.  At the meeting, del Villar and 
Tellez said that if the U.S., Canada and Mexico could come to 
an agreement to trilaterally lower interconnection rates for 
telephony across the region, this would help the GOM to 
convince Telmex to relinquish some hold on the sector. 
 
Comment 
------- 
¶10. (SBU) Telmex seems to be feeling the pressure as there is 
already speculation in the industry that the monopoly will 
file an injunction against Cofetel's proposed interconnection 
plan.  The SCT appears to have firmly taken control of 
telecommunications policy in Mexico and has an arsenal of 
ideas for progress in the sector.  In telecommunication 
negotiations, we are seeing unprecedented levels of positive 
engagement from our Mexican counterparts.  SCT Under 
Secretary del Villar has a lot of energy and progressive 
 
SIPDIS 
ideas, now it's a matter of how much momentum he can gather 
to push for change in the industry.  End comment.

of members of the U.S. delegation from EEB/CIP.
