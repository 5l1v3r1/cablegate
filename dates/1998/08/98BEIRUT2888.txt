---------- 
¶1. SUMMARY 
---------- 
 
THE TWO EXPLOSIONS WERE REPORTED ON THE FRONT-PAGE OF 
EVERY NEWSPAPER IN LEBANON.  MOST REPORTED THE EVENT 
WITH NO EDITORIALIST REACTION.  THE ONLY TWO 
EDITORIALS THAT WERE WRITTEN WERE CONTRADICTORY. 
JOSEPH SAMAHA OF ARAB NATIONALIST DAILY AS-SAFIR 
WARNED THAT "BEING AN ENEMY TO THE US IS ONE THING AND 
PLANNING TERRORIST ATTACKS IS ANOTHER."  HE ADDED, 
"WHOEVER PLANNED THESE ATTACKS MADE A BIG MISTAKE". 
SYRIA'S MOUTHPIECE IN LEBANON 'ASH-SHARQ', HOWEVER, 
RIDICULED THE AMERICAN STATEMENT ON HAVING SOME IDEAS 
ABOUT THE IDENTITY OF THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
EXPLOSIONS.  ASH-SHARQ ACCUSED THE US OF INTENDING TO 
IMPLICATE AN ARAB COUNTRY OR ARAB ISLAMISTS.  IT 
CONCLUDED THAT THE REAL ATTACKER IS THE CIA AND THE 
JEWISH LOBBY.  END SUMMARY.

"TERRORISM TERRORIZES AMERICA IN THE HEART OF AFRICA" 
(ARAB AFFAIRS ASH-SHARQ AL-AWSAT HEADLINE) 
 
"WASHINGTON HAS SOME IDEAS ABOUT THE IDENTITY OF THE 
TERRORISTS AND KENYA ARRESTED A SUSPECT IN ARAB 
CLOTHES" (PRO-SUNNI AL-LIWA' HEADLINE)

FOR EXPLOSIONS" (ARAB AFFAIRS AL-HAYAT HEADLINE)

¶3.  EXCERPTS FROM EDITORIALS: 
----------------------------- 
 
"WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EXPLOSIONS IN AFRICA" A FRONT- 
PAGE EDITORIAL BY AWNI AL-KA'KI IN SYRIA'S MOUTHPIECE 
PRO-BA'TH DAILY 'ASH-SHARQ' (08/8):"IT IS TOO EARLY TO 
DETERMINE THE IDENTITY OF PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
EXPLOSIONS IN AFRICA.  HOWEVER, A FEW HOURS FOLLOWING 
THE EXPLOSIONS, THE US ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAS SOME IDEA 
ABOUT WHO DID IT.  HOW DID THE US GET ITS IDEAS SO 
FAST?  THIS AMERICAN STATEMENT CARRIES DANGEROUS 
INDICATIONS.  IT MEANS THAT THE WHITE HOUSE INTENDS TO 
ACCUSE SOMEBODY, MOST PROBABLY AN ARAB STATE. 
WHAT IS THE US PLANNING TO DO?  PERHAPS IT INTENDS TO 
ACCUSE LIBYA FOLLOWING THE AFRICAN COUNTRIES' DECISION 
TO LIFT EMBARGO AGAINST LIBYA.  PERHAPS THE US INTENDS 
TO ACCUSE IRAN BECAUSE IRAN'S NEW OPENNESS TOWARDS THE 
US BOTHERS ISRAEL.  FINALLY, THE US MAY ACCUSE ALL 
ISLAMISTS! 
WE BELIEVE THAT THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR EXPLOSIONS 
ARE THE JEWISH LOBBY AND THE CIA." 
 
"WHO DARES" A FRONT-PAGE EDITORIAL BY JOSEPH SAMAHA IN 
ARAB NATIONALIST AS-SAFIR (O8/8)"THE MESSAGE SENT BY 
THE EGYPTIAN ISLAMIC "JIHAD" CLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR THE EXPLOSIONS IN AFRICA, (WHETHER THEY ARE REALLY 
RESPONSIBLE OR NOT), ENFEEBLES THE ARABS' ABILITY TO 
DEFEND THEMSELVES FROM BEING AUTOMATICALLY ACCUSED OF 
TERRORIST ACTS AGAINST US INTERESTS AROUND THE 
WORLD... WHOEVER PLANS TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST THE 
US IS COMMITTING A GRAVE MISTAKE.  TERRORIST ATTACKS 
OF THIS TYPE WILL NEVER OUST CLINTON OR CHANGE 
AMERICAN POLICY.  ON THE CONTRARY, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
WILL NEITHER FORSAKE THEIR PRESIDENT IN TIMES OF 
CRISIS, NOR RELENT TO TERRORISTS' DEMANDS.  THE 
RESULT?  MOST OF THE DEAD AND INJURED ARE INNOCENT 
PEOPLE WHOSE DEATHS WON'T FULFILL THE TERRORISTS' 
DESIRES AND DREAMS." 
 
¶4.  POC FOR THIS REPORT IS PETER VROOMAN, POL OFFICER.
