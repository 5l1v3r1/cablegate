SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. ON MAY 23, UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (UNDP) 
RESIDENT COORDINATOR (RESREP) J. VICTOR ANGELO HOSTED AN 
"INFORMAL" MEETING WITH SENIOR-LEVEL GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE 
(GOZ) OFFICIALS, REPRESENTATIVES OF MOST RESIDENT MISSIONS 
OF THE ORGANIZATION OF ECONOMIC COOPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT 
(OECD), AND SELECTED REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE SOUTHERN 
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY (SADC) AND G-77 COUNTRIES TO 
DISCUSS POLICY CONSTRAINTS PREVENTING AN EFFECTIVE RESPONSE 
TO ZIMBABWE'S SERIOUS FOOD CRISIS.  ALTHOUGH THREE GOZ 
MINISTERS WERE INVITED TO THE MEETING, ONLY FINANCE AND 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (MOF) MINISTER SIMBA MAKONI SHOWED UP. 
 
 
¶2. FOLLOWING A BRIEF INTRODUCTION BY RESREP ANGELO, MINISTER 
MAKONI PROCEEDED TO PROVIDE A SUMMARY REPORT OF THE CURRENT 
COUNTRY SITUATION AND THE PLANNED GOZ RESPONSE.  A 
"DIALOGUE" ON POLICY ISSUES RELATED TO THE CRISIS AND 
RESPONSE FOLLOWED.  WHILE MINISTER MAKONI MADE A VALIANT 
STAB AT DEFENDING OFTEN INDEFENSIBLE GOZ POLICIES, THE 
MEETING UNDERSCORED PAST AND PRESENT GOVERNMENT PROBLEMS IN 
WORKING WITH DONOR COUNTRIES.  MAKONI'S GOOD INTENTIONS 
ASIDE, THE MEETING PROVIDED LITTLE REASSURANCE THAT THERE IS 
SUFFICIENT GOZ POLITICAL WILL TO ADDRESS THE SERIOUS ISSUES 
SURROUNDING FOOD SECURITY IN A TIMELY AND EFFECTIVE MANNER. 
SEPARATE, FOLLOWING CONVERSTIONS WITH RESREP ANGELO PROVIDED 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON HOW THE UN HOPES TO KEEP THE 
INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE ON TRACK.  END SUMMARY.

INTRODUCTION 
------------- 
 
¶3. OF THE THREE MINISTERES INIVTED BY UNDP RESREP J. VICTOR 
ANGELO TO THE "INFORMAL" MAY 23 MEETING ON FOOD IDSSUES ONLY 
MOF MINISTER SIMBA MAKONI SHOWED UP.  PERMANENT SECRETARY 
(PMS) MUSEKA OF THE MINISTRY OF PUBLIC SERVICE, LABOR AND 
SOCIAL WELFARE (M/SW) REPRESENTED MINSITER JULY MOYO; AND 
MINISTER OF STATE SECURITY, NICHOLAS GOCHE, INVITED IN HIS 
CAPACITY AS CHAIRMAN OF THE MAIZE IMPORT TASK FORCE, FAILED 
TO SHOW UP DESPITE ANGELO'S EXPECTATION THAT HE WOULD BE 
THERE.  GOCHE'S ASSISTANT DID ARRIVE MID-MEETING TO SILENTLY 
REPRESENT HIS MINISTER'S INTERESTS, IN THE LATTER'S ABSENCE. 
END NOTE. 
 
-------------------- 
GOZ SITUATION UPDATE 
-------------------- 
 
¶4. FOLLOWING AN INTRODUCTION BY RESREP ANGELO, WHO STRESSED 
THE CLOSED NATURE OF THE MEETING TO PROMOTE "FRANK" 
DISCUSSION, MINISTER MAKONI THANKED THE DONOR COUNTRIES 
PRESENT FOR ASSISTANCE PROVIDED TO DATE IN RESPONSE TO 
ZIMBABWE'S HUMANITARIAN CRISIS.  NOTING THAT THIS WAS THE 
THIRD SUCH MEETING ON THIS SUBJECT SINCE THE LAUNCH OF THE 
U.N.'S HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE RELIEF PROGRAMME (HARP) FOR 
ZIMBABWE IN DECMEBER 2001 (REFTEL B) THE MINISTER PROCEEDED 
TO PROVIDE A SUMMARY REPORT OF THE CURRENT COUNTRY SITUATION 
AND THE GOZ RESPONSE. HIGHLIGHTS INCLUDED: 
 
¶A. TO DATE, THE GOZ HAS APPROVED A TOTAL OF 400,000 METRIC 
TONS (MT) OF MAIZE IMPORTS, OF WHICH APPRXIMATELY 240,000 MT 
HAS BEEN PURCHASED, WITH SOME 200,000 MT PROCURED FROM SOUTH 
AFRICA.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE SHORTAGES HAVE IMPEDED THE 
COMPLETION OF THESE PROCUREMENTS, WITH MINISTER MAKONI 
NOTING THAT "WE ARE STILL TRYING TO FIND THE FUNDS" FOR THE 
REMAINDER OF THESE COMMERCIAL PURCHASES. 
 
¶B. APPROXIMATELY 140,000 MT (OF 240,000 MT) OF MAIZE 
PROCUREMENTS HAVE ARRIVED IN COUNTRY TO DATE, WITH 
DELIVERIES SUFFERING SERIOUS DELAYS DUE TO "BOTTLENECKS" 
THROUGHOUT THE FOOD IMPORT AND DISTRIBUTION TRANSPORT CHAIN, 
E.G., INSUFFICIENT RAIL CAPACITY, AND INSUFFICIENT DOMESTIC 
TRUCK TRANSPORT RESOURCES, BOTH FROM THE BORDER TO GRAIN 
MARKETING BOARD (GMB) DEPOTS AND FROM THE DEPOTS TO THE 
FINAL DISTRIBUTION SITES.  MAKONI SAID THAT THERE WAS "TALK 
ABOUT" MOBILIZING ADDITIONAL PRIVATE TRANSPORT CAPCITY TO 
OVERCOME THESE CONSTRAINTS. 
 
¶C. THE NATIONAL CROP FORECASTING COMMITTEE ESTIMATED 600,000 
MT OF MAIZE PRODUCTION THIS YEAR, LEAVING A 1.2 MILLION MT 
DEFICIT (FOR PROJECTED HUMAN CONSUMPTION).  HE NOTED, 
HOWEVER, GOVERNMENT CONCERNS ABOUT THE RELIABILITY OF THIS 
ESTIMATE, SINCE "THE SYSTEM" HAD NOT YET ADJUSTED TO ACCOUNT 
FOR THE CHANGED AGRICULTURAL SITUATION, ESPECIALLY MAIZE 
PRODUCTION ON THE NEWLY RESETTLED "FAST-TRACK" LANDS.  HE 
ALSO NOTED THAT FINAL FIGURES WERE EXPECTED BY END-MONTH. 
NOTE:  FEWSNET HAS ALREADY PROVIDED A FINAL FIGURE FOR TOTAL 
MAIZE PRODUCTION OF 500,000 MT -- 100,000 MT LESS THAN 
MINISTER MAKONI'S ESTIMATE, WHICH WAS BASED ON THE CROP 
ASSESSMENT CONDUCTED TWO MONTHS AGO.  THE JOINT FOOD AND 
AGRICULTURAL ORGANIZATION AND WORLD FOOD PROGRAM FOOD AND 
CROP ASSESSMENT MISSION (REFTEL A) CONCLUDED EARLIER THIS 
MONTH SUPPORTES THE FEWSNET FIGURE. END NOTE. 
 
¶D. THE MINISTER PROCEEDED TO OUTLINE CURRENT GOZ PLANS FOR 
ADDRESSING THIS SITUATION THROUGH AN AMBITIOUS PROGRAM 
TARGETING 7.8 MILLION ZIMBABWEANS FOR FOOD ASSISTANCE OVER 
18 MONTHS.  THE MAJOR PROGRAM COMPONENTS WOULD INCLUDE CASH- 
FOR-WORK (Z$1,500/HOUSEHOLD/MONTH) FOR THE ABLE-BODIED, 
TARGETED FOOD DISTRIBUTIONS FOR THE ELDERLY AND DISABLED, 
AND SUPPLEMENTARY FEEDING PROGRAMS FOR CHILDREN UNDER FIVE 
YEARS OF AGE (TWO KILOGRAMS (KG.) OF "NUTRIMEAL" FOR EACH 
CHILD PER MONTH) AND THREE KG/CHILD/MONTH FOR SOME OF THE 
MOST NEEDY CHILDREN UNDER NINE YEARS OF AGE. 
 
¶E. STATING THAT FOOD IMPORT REQUIREMENTS FOR THIS PROGRAM 
WOULD COST Z$31 BILLION OVER 12 MONTHS FROM THE BEGINNING OF 
THIS CALENDAR YEAR (DECEMBER 2001), MAKONI NOTED THAT ONLY 
Z$20.7 BILLION WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THIS 
CALENDAR YEAR (TO DECEMBER 2002), ALLOWING FOR THE 
FUNDS/TIME WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR SINCE 
JANUARY.  NOTE:  THESE FIGURES ARE MUCH LOWER THAN THOSE 
FROM AN APRIL GOZ DRAFT STRATEGY PAPER, WHICH PROJECTED 
Z$102 BILLION FOR FOOD REQUIREMENTS OVER 18 MONTHS. END 
NOTE.  THE MINISTER ADDED THAT THE GOZ WAS REVIEWING HOW TO 
FIT THESE REQUIREMENTS INTO THE CURRENT YEAR'S BUDGET. 
ACKNOWLEDGING THAT INTERNATIONAL DONOR SUPPORT WOULD BE 
REQUIRED, HE GAVE THE DISTINCT IMPRESSION THAT THE MAJORITY 
COULD BE MET FROM THE GOVERNMENT BUDGET, IN COMBINATION WITH 
THIS YEAR'S HARVEST.  HE CONCLUDED THAT NEXT YEAR'S FOOD 
REQUIREMENTS WOULD BE INCLUDED IN NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET 
(OCTOBER/NOVEMBER, AND WOULD DEPEND ON THE FINAL CROP 
PRODUCTION ESTIMATE, NEXT YEAR'S RAINFALL, AND OTHER SALIENT 
FACTORS. 
 
¶5. PMS MUSEKA FOLLOWED MINISTER MAKONI, BRIEFLY ELABORATING 
ON THE CURRENT SERIOUS CONSTRAINTS THE PROGRAM WAS FACING, 
SUCH AS THE "ACUTE TRANSPORT PROBLEM" (INSUFFICIENT CAPACITY 
AND/OR FUNDS TO HIRE TRUCKS), STAFFING CONSTRAINTS (BOTH FOR 
FOOD DISTRIBUTIONS AND CASH-FOR-WORK PROGRAMS), FUNDING 
CONSTRAINTS (LIMITING THE "POPULAR" CASH-FOR-WORK PROGRAM, 
AND NOTING SEVERAL INSTANCES WHERE PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS HAD 
NOT BEEN PAID FOR COMPLETED WORK).  MUSEKA ALSO NOTED THE 
INADEQUACY OF OLD AND UNRELIABLE CENSUS DATA, WHICH MADE 
PROGRAM DESIGN AND TARGETING DIFFICULT.  THE PERMSEC ALSO 
NOTED THE GROWING PROBLEM OF DISPLACED FARM WORKERS BECAUSE 
OF THE ON-GOING FAST-TRACK LAND REDISTRIBUTION EXERCISE. 
 
------------------ 
"POLICY DIALOGUE" 
------------------ 
¶6. RESREP ANGELO OPENED THE FLOOR FOR QUESTIONS.  THE 
FOLLOWING ISSUES WERE RAISED: FOOD DISTRIBUTION "PROBLEMS"; 
PARTISAN DISTRIBUTION OF RELIEF ASSISTANCE; THE 
COMMICATIONS/DIALOGUE "GAP" BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND DONOR 
COUNTRIES; PRIVATE SECTOR AND NGO PARTICIPATION IN THE 
CRISIS; THE IMPACT OF PRICE CONTROLS AND THE EXCHANGE RATE 
ON THE PROVISION OF FOOD RELIEF; THE IMPACT OF THE FAST- 
TRACK EXERCISE ON THE CURRENT FOOD/AGRICULTURAL SITUATION; 
CLARIFICATION OF THE COUNTRY FOOD SITUATION; FOOD 
TRADE/SALES/MARKETING RESTRICTIONS; (COMMERCIAL) FARMING 
ASSURANCES/SECURITY; PRICE CONTROLS; THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE 
REGIME; AND RESTRICTIONS ON THE IMPORT AND DISTRIBUTION OF 
FOOD COMMODITIES CONTAINING GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS 
(GMO).  THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT 10,00 MT OF 
AMERICAN MAIZE WERE DIVERTED TO OTHER SOUTH AFRICAN 
COUNTRIES BECAUSE OF ZIMBABWE'S FAILURE TO WAIVE GMO 
RESTRICTIONS.  HE STATED THAT CONTINUATION OF GMO 
RESTRICTIONS WOULD SEVERLY LIMIT USG ABILITY TO HELP. 
 
¶7. MAKONI RESPONDED BY DENYING KNOWLEDGE OF A COMMUNICATION 
GAP, CITING PAST INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP MEETINGS ON THIS 
SUBJECT, AND ASSURING DONORS OF HIS CONTINUING WILLINGNESS 
TO MEET AT ANY TIME TO DISCUSS THE ISSUES NOTED ABOVE WITH 
DONOR COUNTRY REPRESENTATIVES. 
 
¶8. ON THE ISSUE OF POLITICAL DISCRIMINATION IN FOOD/RELIEF 
PROGRAMS, THE MINISTER STATED THAT HE HAD HEARD ALLEGATIONS 
BUT WAS UNAWARE OF ANY ACTUAL INCIDENTS OF SUCH ABUSE.  HE 
SAID THAT SPECIFIC INFORMATION (NAMES, NUMBERS, LOCATIONS, 
ETC.) WOULB BE NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM; GENERAL 
ALLEGATIONS WERE NOT USEFUL.  HE STRESSED THAT LOCAL NGOS, 
TRADITIONAL LEADERS, AND OTHERS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROGRAM 
IMPLEMENTATION HAD NOT REPORTED SUCH INCIDENTS IN RESPONSE 
TO HIS OWN HOME-DISTRICT QUERIES ON THE ALLEGATIONS.  THIS 
INFORMATION LED HIM TO QUESTION THE EXTENT OF THIS PROBLEM - 
- HE UNDERSCORED THAT THIS TYPE OF ABUSE IS NOT SOMETHING 
THAT HAPPENS IN ZIMBABWEAN SOCIETY, IN THAT IT IS CULTURALLY 
UNACCEPTABLE (A SINGULARLY CURIOUS STATEMENT, FROM OUR POINT 
OF VIEW).  HOWEVER, HE WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT ANY PROBLEM SO 
THAT IT COULD BE PROMPTLY.  PMS MUSEKA SECONDED MAKONI'S 
STATEMENTS, REITERATING THAT IT WAS THE COMMUNITIES 
THEMSELVES THAT MADE BENEFICIARY DECISIONS AND IMPLEMENTED 
THE PROGRAM.  HE ADDED THAT HIS MINISTRY HAD RECEIVED NO 
REPORTS OF SUCH ABUSE TO DATE AND, THEREFORE, HE WAS 
CONFIDENT THAT "THE SYSTEM IS WORKING WELL." 
 
¶9.  THE MINISTER SUGGESTED THAT THE CONSTRAINTS ON PRIVATE 
SECTOR ACCESS AND INVOLVEMENT WERE MORE ARTIFICIAL THAN 
ACTUAL, CITING SEVERAL POSITIVE STEPS IN THIS AREA.  THESE 
INCLUDED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A PRIVATE SECTOR TRUST FUND BY 
LOCAL BUSINESSES TO ASSIST THE RELIEF EFFORT, AND THE 
REMOVAL OF ANY DUTY ON GRAIN IMPORTS (INCLUDING 25 PERCENT 
DUTY FOR NON-SADC IMPORTS).  HE ADDED THAT THE STATUTORY 
INSTRUMENT BANNING PRIVATE SECTOR IMPORTS/SALES OF BASIC 
CEREALS WAS, IN REALITY, BEING IGNORED, CITING NUMEROUS 
INDIVIDUAL INSTANCES WHERE IMPORT PERMITS HAD BEEN GRANTED 
TO PRIVATE SECTOR SUPPLIERS.  HE STATED HIS WILLINGNESS TO 
CONTINUE TO DEAL FAVORABLY WITH SUCH PRIVATE SECTOR REQUESTS 
"PRACTICALLY", ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS, AS OPPOSED TO 
GETTING BOGGED DOWN IN POLITICS BY ATTEMPTING TO CHANGE 
FORMAL LEGISLATION OR POLICY ON THIS SUBJECT (WHICH IS 
CLEARLY BEYOND HIS POWER TO DO).  PRESSED, MAKONI 
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THIS PRIVATE SECTOR RELIEF APPLIED ONLY TO 
PRIVATE SECTOR IMPORTS FOR DONATIONS TO THEIR OWN EMPLOYEES 
AND HAD NO RELEVANCE TO PRIVATE SECTOR IMPORTS FOR MARKET 
SALES, WHICH WERE IMPRACTICAL, GIVEN THE LOW FIXED PRICE FOR 
MAIZE MEAL. 
 
¶10. ON THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE, MAKONI LARGELY REITERATED 
WHAT WE ALL ALREADY KNEW - WHILE HE WAS ATTEMPTING TO 
ADDRESS IT, THIS WAS A DIFFICULT POLITICAL ISSUE WHICH WAS 
BEYOND HIS POWER ALONE TO CORRECT.  WHILE HE REMAINED 
OPTIMISTIC, NO RESOLUTION HAD YET BEEN CONCLUDED ON THIS 
ISSUE.  THE MINISTER ALSO NOTED HIS CONCERNS REGARDING THE 
MEDIA'S TREATMENT OF THESE ISSUES AS ONLY SERVING TO 
EXACERBATE PROBLEMS AND MAKE HIS ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS THEM 
MORE DIFFICULT. 
 
¶11. ON THE ISSUE OF PRICE CONTROLS, THE MINISTER REITERATED 
THE SAME GENERAL LINE.  CITING SEVERAL RECENT INSTANCES 
WHERE PRICES ON BASIC GOODS AND SERVICES HAD BEEN ADJUSTED, 
HE ENCOURAGED REPORTING/PRESENTATION OF COMMODITY-SPECIFIC 
INSTANCES OF PROBLEMS THAT COULD BE DEALT WITH ON A CASE-BY- 
CASE BASIS (AS OPPOSED TO FORMALLY CHANGING THE RELEVANT 
LAWS OR POLICIES ON THIS SUBJECT).  HE EXPRESSED HIS 
WILLINGNESS TO ATTMEPT TO DEAL WITH ANY SUCH SPECIFIC 
INSTANCES AS EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE. 
 
¶12. MAIKONI ACKNOWLEDGED A "DOWNSIDE TO MAJOR AGRARIAN 
REFORM" - THE FAST TRACK PROGRAM -- IN ZIMBABWE OVER THE 
PAST SEVERAL YEARS.  HE CONCEDED THAT DISTURBANCES ON FARMS 
RESULTING FROM FAST TRACK WERE AT LEAST PARTLY RESPONSIBLE 
FOR THE CURRENT FOOD CRISIS.  NOTING THAT THE LAND 
REDISTRIBUTION PROGRAM WAS NOW ALMOST COMPLETE, HE URGED 
ASSISTANCE TO ALL FARMERS -- INCLUDING FAST-TRACK RESETTLERS 
-- TO STIMULATE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION.  HE FURTHER URGED 
THE DONORS TO "FORGET ABOUT HOW/WHY WE GOT TO WHERE WE ARE", 
THAT "WE MUST WORK WITHIN THE CURRENT REALITY," THAT THERE 
WAS NO BENEFIT TO BE DERIVED FROM "RE-HASHING OLD ISSUES", 
AND THAT WE SHOULD, THEREFORE, "GET ON WITH WHAT'S LEFT." 
 
¶13. ON FARMER SECURITY/ASSURANCES, THE MINISTER NOTED THAT 
THE GOVERNMENT WAS ENCOURAGING AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION IN 
RESPONSE TO THE GROWING FOOD CRISIS.  HE CHARACTERIZED THE 
CURRENT FARMING SITUATION AS "IN TRANSITION", WITH 
GOVERNMENT NOW TRYING TO "REGULARIZE" FAST TRACK AND THUS 
ENSURE FARM/ER SECURITY.  HE STATED HIS BELIEF THAT THE 
SECURITY SITUATION ON COMMERCIAL FARMS HAD IMPROVED OVER THE 
PAST FIVE WEEKS; BUT ALSO THAT FOR A PROGRAM OF THIS 
MAGNITUDE, SUCH ACTIONS TAKE TIME. 
 
¶14. HE ACKNOWLEDGED HAVING HEARD OF THE GMO ISSUE BUT 
EXPRESSED IGNORANCE ABOUT THE TECHNICAL SPECIFICS.  HE 
PLANNED TO CONVENE A MEETING WITH THE BIO-SAFETY BOARD (THE 
ENTITY RESPONSIBLE FOR GOVERNMENT POLICY ON GMOS) IN AN 
ATTEMPT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE.  HE SUGGESTED THAT 
ONE POSSIBLE CONCERN WAS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON BEEF 
EXPORTS TO CERTAIN TRADING PARTNERS (THE EUROPEAN UNION) 
FROM GMO-FED LIVESTOCK.  NOTE: MISSION/WFP HAS INFORMATION 
THAT STRONGLY SUGGESTS THAT GMO-FED LIVESTOCK IS NOT A 
SIGNIFICANT ISSUE FOR THE EU/EC.  END NOTE.  THE MINISTER 
EXPRESSED THE NEED FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED IN THIS 
ISSUE TO COORDINATE.  WHILE ADMITTING THE GOZ'S ATTENTION TO 
THIS ISSUE CAME LATE, HE CONCLUDED WITH "BETTER LATE THAN 
NEVER." 
 
¶15. AMBASSADOR SULLIVAN'S REQUESTED CLARIFICATION ON THE 
CURRENT FOOD SITUATION -- INITIALLY, MINISTER MAKONI 
APPEARED TO SUGGEST THAT THE NATION'S FOOD NEEDS FOR THE 
REMAINDER OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR COULD ADEQUATELY BE MET FROM 
GOVERNMENT IMPORTS AND THIS YEAR'S HARVEST (STRONGLY 
IMPLYING THAT NO INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE WOULD BE REQUIRED, 
AT LEAST OVER THIS PERIOD).  HOWEVER, IN RESPONSE TO 
SPECIFIC FOLLOW-UP QUERIES ON THIS SUBJECT BY THE BRITISH 
HIGH COMMISSIONER, THE MINISTER RETRACTED THIS POSITION, 
STATING, "OF COURSE WE WILL NEED INTERNATIONAL/EXTERNAL 
ASSISTANCE."  HE HAD APPARENTLY DOUBTED-COUNTED PURCHASES 
MADE THIS YEAR, THEREBY MAXIMIZING GOZ RESOURCES. 
ADDITIONAL ATTEMPTS TO CLARIFY THE FIGURES SPAWNED 
CONFUSION, WITH THE MINISTER FINALLY STATING THAT HE WOULD 
NEED TO "REVIEW THE FIGURES", AND THAT HE WOULD GET BACK TO 
THE AUDIENCE WITH THE CORRECT POSITION ON THIS SUBJECT AS 
SOON AS POSSIBLE. 
 
¶16. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE MEETING, THE MALAWIAN HIGH 
COMMISSIONER TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO NOTE THE GREATER 
REGIONAL NATURE OF THE PROBLEM.  SHE HIGHLIGHTED HER OWN 
COUNTRY'S DESPERATE SITUATION, CITING ONE PRESS REPORT 
INDICATING THAT ONE IN FIVE MALAWIANS WERE UNDER SEVERE 
THREAT OF DYING FROM STARVATION.  SHE EXPRESSED HER 
COUNTRY'S GRATITUDE FOR DONOR ASSISTANCE PLEDGED/PROVIDED TO 
DATE, AND ENDORSED THIS TYPE OF CONSULTATIVE EXCHANGE AS THE 
ONLY WAY TO PROPERLY ADDRESS A SERIOUS CRISIS OF THIS SCOPE 
AND MAGNITUDE. 
 
¶17. AT A PRIVATE LUNCH IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE MEETING, 
UNDP RESREP ANGELO ELABORATED ON A FEW OF MAKONI'S REMARKS 
AND TOOK ABOARD A FEW SUGGESTIONS FROM THE AMBASSADOR ON 
POSSIBLE NEXT STEPS.  HIGHLIGHTS OF THE CONVERSATION 
INCLUDED: 
 
-- THE AMBASSADOR SUGGESTED THAT IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR 
THE UN TO ORGANIZE FIELD VISITS BY DIPLOMATS AND 
INTERNATIONAL JOURNALISTS TO FOOD DISTRIBUTION SITES, BOTH 
TO PUBLICIZE THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM AND TO DISCOURAGE ANY 
TEMPTATION FOR ANYONE TO MANIPULATE FOOD DISTRIBUTION FOR 
POLITICAL ENDS.  ANGELO AGREED THAT DIPLOMATIC VISIST WERE 
DESIRABLE BUT OPINED THAT JOURNALISTS WOULD BE MORE 
COMFORTABLE FENDING FOR THEMSELVES.  THE AMBASSADOR STRESSED 
THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT THE MEDIA BE ALLOWED TO VIEW THE 
SITUATION CLOSE UP. 
 
-- THE AMBASSADOR STRESSED THAT THE PRESENCE OF INDEPENDENT 
MONITORS OF WFP FOOD AID WOULD SERVE TO LIMIT GOZ PARANOIA 
AND TAKE A BURDEN OFF THE UN.  HE SAID THAT HE WAS CERTAIN 
THAT DONOR SUPPORT FOR SUCH AN EFFORT WOULD BE FORTHCOMING. 
ANGELO ACCEPTED THAT SGS AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING 
ORGANIZATIONS WOULD BE WELL PLACED TO TACKLE SUCH AN 
ASSIGNMENT. 
 
-- THE AMBASSADOR POINTED OUT THAT THE CREDIBILITY OF THE 
RELIEF EFFORT DEPENDED UPON STRAIGHTFORWARD PRESENTATION OF 
THE FACTS, INCLUDING THE CAUSES OF THE PROBLEM.  IT WOULD BE 
NECESSARY TO PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FLAWED GOZ POLICIES, 
AND NOT JUST DROUGHT, HAD CONTRIBUTED TO THE CRISIS.  ANGELO 
AGREED. 
 
-- ANGELO SAID THAT THE GOZ HAS FINALLY TAKEN THE LID OFF 
THE PLIGHT OF FARM WORKERS.  A UNDP TEAM IS CURRENTLY IN THE 
FIELD ATTEMPTING TO TAKE THE MEASURE OF THIS VERY 
COMPLICATED SITUATION.  HE HOPED TO HAVE A CLEARER PICTURE 
OF NUMBERS, LOCATIONS, AND NEEDS SOON. 
 
-- ANGELO SAID THAT THE UNSYG HAD MET WITH MUGABE TWICE 
DURING MUGABE'S RECENT VISIT TO NEW YORK.  THE FIRST MEETING 
FOCUSSED ON TECHNICAL/HUMANITARIAN ISSUES, WITH MUGABE 
APPEARING LARGELY BLANK ON THE DIMENSIONS OF THE FOOD CRISIS 
DESPITE THE FACT THAT NIGERIAN MEDIATOR ADEDEJI HAD GIVEN 
HIM A PAPER (DRAFTED BY ANGELO) DESCRIBING THE SITUATION. 
MUGABE PAID LIP SERVICE TO RETURNING TO ABUJA, BUT LITTLE 
ELSE.  THE SECOND MEETING FOCUSED ON THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE 
AND WAS SINGULARLY UNPRODUCTIVE.  MUGABE FEIGNED SURPRISE 
THAT THE INTER-PARTY TALKS, WHICH HE TERMED AS "TECHNICAL," 
HAD COLLAPSED AND SAID THAT THIS INITIATIVE WAS THE CONCERN 
OF HIS SUBORDINATES AND THAT HE WAS NOT INVOLVED. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶18. MAKONI MADE HIS USUAL VALIANT EFFORT TO DEFEND OFTEN 
INDEFENSIBLE GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND ACTIONS VIS A VIS THE 
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS.  HOWEVER, THE MEETING MOSTLY 
UNDERSCORED PAST AND PRESENT GOVERNMENT PROBLEMS IN WORKING 
WITH DONOR COUNTRIES INVOLVED.  THE RECURRING PROBLEMS OF 
RELATIVE PRIORITIES, INTERMINISTERIAL ACCOUNTABILITY, AND 
POLITICAL INTRANSIGENCE ALL MANIFESTED THEMSELVES IN VARIOUS 
STAGES OF THE PROCEEDINGS.  MAKONI HAS NEVER BEEN THE 
PROBLEM, NOR THROUGH ANY FAULT OF HIS OWN THE FIX, BUT 
DESPITE HIS BEST INTENTIONS THE OUTCOME OF THE MEETING WAS 
LESS THAN SATISFACTORY.  INDIVIDUAL CASE-SPECIFIC SOLUTIONS 
WILL SIMPLY NOT SUFFICE IN ADDRESSING A CRISIS OF THIS 
MAGNITUDE, DEMANDS SERIOUS POLICY REFORM ARE REQUIRED.  THE 
FINANCE MINISTER'S APPARENT CONFUSION OVER ACTUAL COUNTRY 
NEEDS AND DONOR REQUIREMENTS WAS PARTICULARLY DISTRESSING IN 
THE CONTEXT OF A NATIONAL FOOD CRISIS OF HISTORICAL 
DIMENSIONS.  IT PROVIDED LITTLE REASSURANCE THAT THE 
POLITICAL WILL AND WHEREWITHALL EXIST WITHIN GOVERNMENT TO 
ADDRESS THESE SERIOUS POLICY CONCERNS IN A TIMELY AND 
EFFECTIVE MANNER.  HIS "LET BYGONES BE BYGONES" RHETORIC, 
IMPLYING THAT THE DONORS SHOULD SUFFER COLLECTIVE AMNESIA 
ABOUT THE ABUSIVE GOZ LAND GRAB PRESENTLY ONGOING, AND GET 
ON WITH FORKING OVER TO THE GOZ WHAT IT THINKS IT NEEDS TO 
REBUILD THE COUNTRY ANEW IN ITS OWN ZANU-PF IMAGE, MERITS NO 
FURTHER COMMENT.
