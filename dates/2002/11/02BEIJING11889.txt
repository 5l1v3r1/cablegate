SUBJECT: CHINA:  2002 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 201772 
 
¶1.  BELOW IS THE 2002 TERRORISM REPORT FOR CHINA. 
RESPONSES ARE KEYED TO REFTEL PARAGRAPH TWO 
REQUIREMENTS. 
 
¶2.  A)  CHINA TREATS DESIGNATIONS OF TERRORISTS UNDER 
EXECUTIVE ORDER 13224 ON AN EQUAL BASIS WITH THOSE 
DESIGNATED BY THE UNITED NATIONS.  THE PRC REGULARLY 
INSTRUCTS ITS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO SEARCH FOR AND 
FREEZE ASSETS OF DESIGNATED TERRORIST ENTITIES.  CHINA 
HAS RATIFIED TEN OF THE TWELVE INTERNATIONAL 
COUNTERTERRORISM CONVENTIONS.  IT HAS SIGNED THE 
INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON THE SUPPRESSION OF TERRORIST 
FINANCING, BUT THE AGREEMENT HAS NOT YET BEEN SUBMITTED 
TO THE NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS FOR RATIFICATION. 
CHINA HAS NOT SIGNED THE INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON THE 
MARKING OF EXPLOSIVES FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETECTION. 
 
B)  THERE WERE NO ACTS OF TERRORISM COMMITTED IN CHINA 
THIS YEAR AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS OR INTERESTS.  THERE 
HAVE BEEN SEVERAL REPORTS DURING THE YEAR OF BOMBINGS IN 
VARIOUS PARTS OF CHINA; IT IS UNCLEAR, HOWEVER, WHETHER 
THESE WERE POLITICALLY MOTIVATED ACTS OF TERRORISM OR 
CRIMINAL ATTACKS. 
 
C,D)  EMBASSY IS UNAWARE OF ANY EXTRADITIONS OR REQUESTS 
FOR EXTRADITIONS OF TERRORISTS TO OR FROM CHINA IN 2002. 
 
E)  CHINESE OFFICIALS AT ALL LEVELS REGULARLY DENOUNCE 
TERRORISM, BOTH IN PUBLIC STATEMENTS AND IN 
INTERNATIONAL FORA.  IF ASKED TO DO SO, WE BELIEVE CHINA 
WOULD GENERALLY COOPERATE WITH INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM 
INVESTIGATIONS. 
 
F)  CHINA REGULARLY PARTICIPATES IN SECURITY COUNCIL 
DISCUSSIONS ON TERRORISM AND JOINED IN STATEMENTS 
DENOUNCING TERRORISM AT THE 2002 APEC MEETING, THE ASEAN 
REGIONAL FORUM, AND THE ASEAN PLUS 3 MEETING.  CHINA 
ALSO ATTENDED THE MUNICH CONFERENCE ON SECURITY POLICY. 
 
G,H)  CHINA DOES NOT SUPPORT TERRORISM, TERRORISTS OR 
TERRORIST GROUPS.  IT HAS NOT MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS 
IN SUPPORT OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A 
TERRORISM ISSUE, BUT DOES MAINTAIN DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS 
WITH ALL OF THOSE COUNTRIES DESIGNATED BY THE SECRETARY 
OF STATE AS STATE SPONSORS OF TERRORISM. 
 
I) THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN CHINA'S 
ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM IN THE PAST YEAR. 
 
J)  THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA HOLD SEMI-ANNUAL 
COUNTERTERRORISM CONSULTATIONS, AS WELL AS EXPERT LEVEL 
CONSULTATIONS ON THE FINANCIAL ASPECTS OF TERRORISM. 
CHINA ALSO ATTENDED THE SOUTHEAST ASIA COUNTERTERRORISM 
CONFERENCE IN HONOLULU.  AS DISCUSSED IN ITEM A, CHINA 
TREATS DESIGNATIONS OF TERRORISTS UNDER EXECUTIVE ORDER 
13224 ON AN EQUAL BASIS WITH THOSE DESIGNATED BY THE 
UNITED NATIONS.  THE PRC REGULARLY INFORMS ITS FINANCIAL 
INSTITUTIONS TO SEARCH FOR AND FREEZE ASSETS OF 
DESIGNATED TERRORIST ENTITIES.  THE UNITED STATES AND 
CHINA ALSO SHARE INFORMATION IN A NUMBER OF AREAS, 
INCLUDING THROUGH LAW ENFORCEMENT CHANNELS, CONCERNING 
PERSONS POSSIBLY INVOLVED WITH TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. 
 
CHINA AGREED IN 2002 TO PERMIT THE FBI TO OPEN AN OFFICE 
IN BEIJING.  THAT OFFICE IS NOW OPEN AND WILL HELP 
COORDINATE WITH THE PRC ON TERRORISM-RELATED ISSUES. 
 
THE UNITED STATES HAS ALSO ASKED CHINA TO PARTICIPATE IN 
THE CONTAINER SECURITY INITIATIVE (CSI).  DURING HIS 
MEETING WITH PRESIDENT BUSH IN CRAWFORD, TEXAS, 
PRESIDENT JIANG ZEMIN ANNOUNCED ACCEPTANCE OF THE CSI. 
DETAILS HAVE NOT BEEN WORKED OUT.
