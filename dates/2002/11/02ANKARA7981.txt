Econoff met with Nilgun Altindag, Director General for 
Customs, and Ahmet Ilguz, Customs Expert, on November 7 
to deliver the U.S. position on customs classification 
of Eggo Waffles, the Avid Media Composer 1000, and 
Multifunctional Digital Machines (reftels) to be 
discussed at the upcoming Harmonized System Committee. 
Ilguz responded that he agreed with the U.S. positions 
on the Avid Media Composer and Multifunctional Digital 
Machines, but that, as a candidate country, Turkey would 
coordinate its position with that of the EU.  Customs 
said that it disagreed with our position on Eggo 
Waffles, as they do not meet the water content criteria 
in the Explanatory Notes.  Given the complete absence of 
Turkish waffle production, Customs told us that Turkey 
does not have a strong view on this issue and was open 
to classifying Eggo Waffles as waffles if the 
Explanatory Notes are amended.
