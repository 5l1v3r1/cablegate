¶1.  (SBU) Embassy is concerned with the delays in 
implementing the Grant Agreement between Turkey and the 
United States, signed on September 13, involving nearly $200 
million in grant assistance to Turkey.  We understand there 
are technical legal problems between the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York and USAID holding up disbursement of this grant. 
The Turkish Government in its debt program has planned to use 
these funds to make payments to the IMF November 7. 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU) We are concerned that the intent of this grant, to 
recognize Turkey's contribution to the Global War on 
Terrorism by taking the lead on peace-keeping in Afghanistan, 
is being lost in our internal bureaucratic hurdles. The 
Turkish Treasury has informed us that the eight-week delay is 
not explicable.  Ultimately the danger is that this delay 
reduces the benefit to U.S. interests from the grant. 
Embassy urges State and Treasury to raise with both USAID and 
the Federal Reserve Bank the urgency of finalizing 
arrangements for disbursing this loan this week.
