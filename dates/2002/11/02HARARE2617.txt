SUBJECT: GOVERNMENT NEWSPAPER REPLAYS CARTER CRITICISM OF 
PRESIDENT BUSH 
 
 
  ¶1.  Under headline Bush needs political education the 
      government-controlled daily "Chronicle" used its 
      November 18 editorial to urge President Bush to take 
      advice from former President Carter. Excerpts: 
 
  ¶2.  ". . .The United States is in the forefront of 
      calling for the disarmament of Iraq which is 
      believed to have weapons of mass destruction but it 
      is not prepared to lead the way by disarming itself. 
      It is also known for preaching abstractions such a 
      democracy, good governance and the rule of law but 
      evidence on the ground does not show that it is 
      practicing these values.  U.S. President George W. 
      Bush and his British ally Tony Blair are threatening 
      to attack Iraq should it not disarm. . .  Former 
      U.S. president Jimmy Carter and this year's Nobel 
      Peace price winner on Friday exposed the U.S.'s 
      hypocrisy when he said while the U.S. was leading 
      the crusade for countries such as North Korea and 
      Iraq to disarm, it is in fact building up dangerous 
      weapons itself. . .  The 78-year old statesman also 
      said that there was a feeling among other nations 
      that the U.S. has become too arrogant, too dominant 
      and too self-centered. . .' and wants to control the 
      world.  The former U.S. leader has made a pertinent 
      observation and we hope the Bush administration will 
      listen to this voice of reason.  It does not need a 
      rocket scientist to tell that the U.S. is 
      unnecessarily pushing its weight around accusing 
      small nations of all sorts of things,  The question 
      that many peace-loving people in the global village 
      are asking is, who will police the Americans who 
      appear to have declared themselves as world 
      'watchdog.' 
 
      "Recently a Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of 
      State for African Affairs in the U.S. government 
      Mark Bellamy said his government was considering 
      "all approaches' to distribute food directly to 
      villagers.  The U.S. Government has for sometime now 
      been accusing the government of Zimbabwe of failing 
      to comply with the basic principles of democracy and 
      human rights violations.  We are also wondering 
      whether Bush's win of that country's controversial 
      presidential election through the courts can be 
      defined by all standards as democrac" at play.  It 
      is for this reason that we implore Bush to seek 
      advice from the likes of Carter for better a America 
      and a better world for all - big and small."
