¶1.  EconCouns delivered reftel demarche to MFA Deputy 
Director General for International Relations Osman Paksut on 
November 26.  Paksut said Turkey's Embassy in Addis Ababa had 
kept the Ministry informed of the developing food crisis, but 
the MFA had not yet made any decisions about whether it could 
respond. 
 
 
¶2.  While noting that Turkey's ongoing financial crisis made 
it difficult for the government to provide assistance, Paksut 
said he would consult within the MFA and with the Turkish Red 
Crescent to see what might be possible.  One option would be 
for the Red Crescent to provide a small amount of cash.  If, 
as suggested in reftel, the international donor community is 
able to come up with funds to cover transportation, Turkey 
might be able to provide surplus grain.  Paksut promised to 
update Embassy following his internal consultations. 
Meanwhile, Embassy will raise the issue in its next meeting 
with the Red Crescent.
