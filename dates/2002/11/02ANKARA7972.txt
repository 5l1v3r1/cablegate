¶1.  Post provided materials in Ref A to MFA Head of 
Environment Department Asli Oral. On Nov 5, MFA advised that 
an interagency committee met in Turkey prior to COP 12 and 
agreed to respond negatively to the Japanese proposal on 
Northern Hemisphere minke whales and the western North 
Pacific stock of Bryde whales. Though this position is 
unlikely to change, the GOT will follow discussions closely 
before casting formal reply. Turkey will be a non-party to 
discussions on the Mexican proposal regarding cooperation 
between CITES and IWC. 
 
 
¶2.  Representing Turkey at the conference on these issues 
will be Ms. Safak Kemaloglu, Head of Section, Ministry of 
Environment; Mr. Hasan Kilic, Agriculture Engineer, Ministry 
of Agriculture; and a third secretary from the Embassy of 
Turkey in Santiago.
