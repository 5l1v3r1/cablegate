¶1.  This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary 
for November 26, 2002.  Please note that Turkish

POLITICS, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
-------------------------------- 
 
 
¶2.  PRO-OCALAN PROTEST IN ADANA 
(Evrensel)  A group of youths who call themselves 
"Democratic Uprising Youth" gathered in Seyhan's 
(Adana) Yenibey quarter on November 24 to protest 
PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan's isolation.  During 
the demonstration, they lit fires, closed the 
main road to traffic and shouted pro-Ocalan 
slogans. 
 
 
¶3.  DRIVE TO SPEAK IN KURDISH 
(Evrensel)  Centennial University (Van) students 
launched a campaign to speak in Kurdish on the 
campus over the next two days to mark the first 
anniversary of the Mother-tongue Education 
Campaign.  The students will not participate in 
class interactions and will not respond to their 
professors. 
 
 
¶4.  BAN ON KURDISH NAME 
(Evrensel)  Mersin Birth Registry Directorate 
denied Mersin resident Mehmet Emin Aydin 
permission to give the name "Jelya" to his 
newborn daughter, claiming it is "not Turkish." 
Aydin called the decision "unlawful" and "a 
family choice."  Aydin said he would pursue all 
legal avenues, including the European Court of 
Human Rights, to assert his rights.  Hurriyet 
cited the new Culture Minister, Huseyin Celik, as 
saying that all kinds of names could be given to 
children as long as they did not connote 
animosity. 
 
 
¶5.  ELECTRICITY THIEVES ARRESTED 
(Evrensel)  In Diyarbakir, 19 Turkish Electricity 
Distribution Corporation (TEDAS) subscribers were 
arrested for illegal use of electricity. 
 
 
¶6.  OHAL PAYMENTS TO CONTINUE AFTER OHAL'S 
ABOLITION 
(Sabah)  The State of Emergency (OHAL), put in 
effect in Eastern and Southeastern Turkey in 
1987, will be lifted in Diyarbakir and Sirnak on 
November 30 in line with a recent decision made 
by the Turkish National Security Council (MGK). 
The Interior Ministry has come up with a formula 
to shift to "Critical Province" practice in the 
Southeast after OHAL's abolition.  The new 
formula will allow OHAL compensation payments 
made to personnel serving in the region to 
continue.  (Note:  Such payments are similar to 
"danger pay.")  These payments were designed to 
encourage personnel serving in the region and the 
new formula is intended to avoid a possible 
shortage of personnel in the future.  The 
Ministry has included Diyarbakir, Sirnak, 
Hakkari, Mus, Van, Bingol, Mardin, Bitlis, Siirt, 
Tunceli and Batman on the list of "Critical 
Provinces."  After November 30, OHAL Governor's 
Office will reportedly be replaced with a 
"Coordinator Governorate," similar to those used 
in disaster areas. 
 
 
ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS 
-------------------------------------- 
¶7.  NEW COMMERCIAL CREDIT AGREEMENT SIGNED 
(Turkiye)  The Gaziantep Chamber of Commerce 
signed a protocol agreement with Is Bank in an 
effort to contribute to anticipated economic 
growth and revival.  Under the agreement, Is Bank 
will provide chamber members with commercial 
credits totaling up to TL 60 billion (approx. USD 
40,000) each. 
 
 
¶8.  INCREASE IN WATER PRICE 
(Hurriyet/Milliyet/Turkiye)  Adana Municipality's 
Water and Sewage Administration (ASKI) increased 
the price of city water by 28%.  With the 
increase, the price of per cubic meter of water 
rose from TL 781,000 (approx. USD 0.50) to TL 1 
million (approx. USD 0.64).
