¶1.   Under headline "Forget about Mugabe's peace," the 
   independent weekly "The Standard" dedicated its 
   April 21 editorial to criticizing Robert Mugabe's 
   for preaching but not practicing.  Excerpts: 
 
¶2.   "Robert Mugabe's hypocrisy continues to be 
   exposed 
   every time he addresses the nation.  Despite the 
   fact that Zimbabweans and the world are well aware 
   of his brutal dictatorial tendencies, Mugabe 
   nevertheless vainly tries to portray himself as a 
   unifying dove of peace.  His address at Thursday's 
   Independence Day celebrations exposed this double 
   standard.  Well aware of the political turmoil 
   besetting Zimbabwe, Mugabe delivered a speech laden 
   with the gospel of peace and political tolerance. . 
   .  Unfortunately it comes too late.  Over 120 
   opposition supporters have been killed by his 
   followers since the referendum.  His tone in recent 
   years has been one of hate, bitterness and 
   division.  In fact he has successfully divided this 
   nation in order to rule it. . .  Mugabe's legacy of 
   hate and division hangs over the country like a 
   dark cloud."
