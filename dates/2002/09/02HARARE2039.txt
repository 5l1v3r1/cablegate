SUBJECT: GOVERNMENT PAPER REPORTS ZIMBABWE WILL ACCEPT 
BIOTECH FOOD AID 
 
 
  ¶1.   According to a front-page, above-the-fold report 
      in the September 6 edition of the government-owned 
      Herald, President Mugabe has ruled that Zimbabwe will 
      accept food aid that may contain biotech products. 
      However, the President added that that such food relief 
      will be subject to special shipping, milling and 
      distribution requirements. 
 
  ¶2.   Under the banner headline "GM Food aid gets nod: 
      Conditions for imports set; Shipment to be quarantined" 
      the government-controlled daily "The Herald" (09/06) 
      carried the following story: 
 
  ¶3.   "The government, which previously indicated it 
      would reject genetically modified food, yesterday 
      (September 5) announced it will accept the food aid but 
      on condition that it will be quarantined to allow 
      Zimbabwe's agricultural scientists to closely monitor 
      its shipment, milling and distribution in the country. 
      . . However, an understanding was reached yesterday 
      between the government and World Food Program (WFP) 
      whereby the WFP will inform Zimbabwe when it would be 
      bringing in the food.  The UN food agency will also 
      import non-GMO maize, beans and other foodstuffs. . . 
      A UN humanitarian assistance team, led by WFP director 
      Mr. Tim (sic) Morris, held separate meetings with 
      President Mugabe, the Minister if Finance and Economic 
      Development, Herbert Murerwa, and the Minister of 
      Public Service, Labor and Social Welfare, July Moyo 
      yesterday.  As part of the agreement, the WFP will 
      increase its monthly food imports into Zimbabwe from 
      10,000 tons to 55,000 tons.  The food is going to be 
      shipped through East London and Durban in South Africa 
      and Maputo and Beira in Mozambique. . .  The President 
      said the government was going to cooperate with the WFP 
      and everybody who wants food would be fed regardless of 
      the color of their skin, religious or political 
      persuasion.  `We don't go that far with our politics,' 
      he said. . . ."
