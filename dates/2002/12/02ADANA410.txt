¶2.  U.S. WARNS TERROR MIGHT HIT GAZIANTEP 
(Hurriyet/Milliyet)  The U.S. State Department issued a 
statement warning U.S. citizens in Turkey that terrorists 
might be planning a terrorist attack in Southeastern 
Turkey.  The statement warned U.S. citizens to pay special 
attention especially during entry to and exit from the 
Gaziantep Airport, which is in use as the Adana Airport is 
under renovation.  The warning noted that the Turkish 
government had taken measures against such a threat. 
Turkiye and Bolge reported that, following the warning, 
security measures at Incirlik (Adana) had been elevated, 
with vehicles entering and exiting Incirlik being 
thoroughly searched. 
 
 
¶3.  DEPLOYMENT ALONG IRAQI BORDER 
(Sabah/Milli Gazete)  Ankara began to deploy soldiers from 
Sanliurfa and Diyarbakir along the Iraqi border due to a 
possible U.S. operation against Iraq.  Soldiers were being 
transported in covered military trucks, as well as civilian 
passenger busses, with Jandarma taking security measures 
along the 90-km Mardin-Diyarbakir highway. 
 
 
¶4.  OHAL CONTINUES IN LICE (DIYARBAKIR) 
(Sabah)  Celebrations were held to celebrate the abolition 
of the State of Emergency (OHAL), but the only thing that 
changed in Lice (Diyarbakir) was that curfew hours now 
begin at 10:00 p.m., instead of 4:00 p.m.  Lice resident 
Mehmet Emin Alagunduz was ordered to remain in custody on 
December 5 (the first day of the Ramadan Holiday) for 
"resistance and insult to police."  According to his 
testimony in the court file, the reason for the scuffle 
that landed him in prison was violation of curfew hours.

(Cumhuriyet)  Muzaffer Abdulkaya and Osman Aktas, arrested 
on October 20 in Istanbul and ordered to remain in custody 
by a Diyarbakir court, testified Mehmet Besir Varol was

Turkey.  The Diyarbakir State Security Court was reported 
to have issued an arrest warrant for Varol in absentia. 
 
 
¶6.  BAN ON PUBLICATIONS LIFTED 
(Evrensel)  Newspapers and magazines which had not been
