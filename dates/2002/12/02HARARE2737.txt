  ¶1.   Under headline "World must fight terrorism" the 
      government-controlled daily "Chronicle" dedicated its 
      November 30 editorial to calling for "a united front 
      against terrorism" and urged world leaders to "desist from 
      harboring terrorist groups."  Excerpts: 
 
  ¶2.   "Terrorism whatever its motive is 
      unacceptable. . .On Thursday suicide bombers blew up 
      a hotel full of Israelis in Kenya killing 14 people 
      minutes after missiles narrowly missed an Israeli 
      airliner taking off nearby.  The attacks appear to 
      have been well orchestrated and synchronized by the 
      forces of evil.  Although a group that calls itself 
      `Army of Palestine' sent a claim of responsibility, 
      Israel and Kenyan authorities reportedly blamed the 
      al Qaeda network largely accused of the 11 September 
      2001 bombings in the United States for the attack. 
      It is however our hope that the authorities will 
      institute thorough investigations into this matter 
      and bring those behind the heinous act to book.  We 
      are basically saying no to terrorism regardless of 
      where it is happening in the global village. 
      Terrorists have to be tracked down and killed as 
      banditry of any nature causes unnecessary human 
      suffering and retards development.  A united front 
      against terrorism has to be forged if the cancer is 
      to be nipped in the bud.  World leaders should 
      desist from harboring terrorists groups in their 
      countries as this helps them to flourish and spread 
      their tentacles.  While this ugly incident was 
      taking place in Kenya another bomb was exploding in 
      South Africa at the Mtamvuma Bridge. . .These 
      terrorist activities have left many people in the 
      sub-region who watched the movie-style attack on the 
      ¶U. S. unsettled.  It is now clear that all of us are 
      vulnerable to attack by terrorists and should thus 
      prepare for any eventuality. . . ."
