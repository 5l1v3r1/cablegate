POLITICS, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
-------------------------------- 
 
 
¶2.  PROPOSED ANTI-WAR RALLY IN ADANA BANNED 
(Bolge)  The Adana Security Directorate has reportedly 
cancelled the proposed anti-war rally to be held by 
the Adana War Opponents Platform on December 22.  Two 
different newspapers reported different reasons for 
the cancellation.  Bolge cited a soccer match, while 
Evrensel reported that the Adana Governor's office had 
refused to grant permission due to sensitivity of the 
situation in Iraq, existence of a U.S. base and 
consulate in Adana, intelligence that illegal groups 
might provoke the rally, and personal security of 
American citizens. 
 
 
¶3.  OPPOSITION TO POSSIBLE U.S. WAR IN IRAQ 
(Bolge)  Ahmet Kilic, State Employees Union 
Confederation (KESK) Term Spokesperson and Haber-Sen 
Union Adana chapter President, voiced opposition to 
the proposed U.S. operation against Iraq, saying oil 
resources underlie U.S.' current Iraq policies. 
"People ruling Turkey must under no condition side 
with the U.S. aggression," Kilic added.  He also 
called for the closure of Adana's Incirlik Air Base 
and cancellation of the Turkey-U.S. and Israel 
agreement.  Evrensel cited the Adiyaman Democracy 
Platform as calling for a more intense struggle 
against the proposed war.  In a Diyarbakir meeting, 
KESK National President Sami Evren also expressed 
opposition to the possible Iraq war. 
 
 
¶4.  ADANA AIRPORT RENOVATION PROJECT DELAYED 
(Bolge)  In a press release issued by Adana State 
Airports Administration (DHMI) Director Cengiz Asikli, 
the repair and maintenance project of the Adana 
Airport, closed to flights on November 4, was 
suspended on December 19 due to heavy rainfall.  The 
project will resume after the rain has stopped. 
 
 
¶5.  KURDISH-LANGUAGE SINGERS ACQUITTED 
(Radikal/Cumhuriyet/Evrensel)  During the December 19 
trial, the Diyarbakir State Security Court acquitted 
nine people, among them seven teachers, charged with 
"assisting and abetting the PKK" for singing 
separatist Kurdish-language songs during the Congress 
of the Diyarbakir chapter of the Teachers Union 
Egitim-Sen.  The acquittal was based on an expert 
witness report from the state-run Turkish Radio and 
Television (TRT) saying the songs sung at the Congress 
were about love, nature and longing. 
 
 
¶6.  USE OF KURDISH NAMES STILL A PROBLEM 
(Evrensel)  The Mersin Birth Registry Director refused 
to register the Kurdish name "Zozan" ("Plateau") that 
parent Ali Askan wanted to give to his four-year-old 
daughter. 
 
 
¶7.  HASHISH SEIZURE 
(Turkiye)  Acting on a tip, Batman police seized 15 
kilograms of hashish powder, 200 kilograms of hashish, 
and materials and tools used in producing hashing 
powder in two separate operations.  Five suspects were 
arrested.  In addition, 28.9 kilograms of unprocessed 
heroin were confiscated in Yuksekova (Hakkari).  Four 
suspects arrested in connection with the confiscation
