   UNFORGIVABLY," INDEPENDENT DAILY "THE DAILY NEWS' 
   (03/18) COMMENTS: 
 
   "THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CRUCIAL PLAYERS WHO MADE IT 
   POSSIBLE YESTERDAY FOR ROBERT MUGABE TO STAND 
   BEFORE CHIEF JUSTICE GODFREY CHIDYAUSIKU WHO SWORE 
   HIM IN AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS THIRD TERM AS 
   PRESIDENT OF ZIMBABWE.  THE MAN AT THE CENTER OF 
   MUGABE'S PYRRHIC (SIC) VICTORY IS TOBAIWA MUDEDE, 
   THE REGISTRAR-GENERAL AND A CLOSE RELATIVE OF THE 
   PRESIDENT.  THE DISPUTED PLEBISCITE IS THE SIXTH 
   NATIONAL POLL HE HAS PRESIDED OVER. . .  MUDEDE'S 
   RECORD AS A PARTISAN AND INCOMPETENT PUBLIC 
   OFFICIAL IS WELL DOCUMENTED. . .  IN ORDER TO 
   COMMAND THE RESPECT OF ALL CONTESTANTS IN AN 
   ELECTION, THE REGISTRAR-GENERAL MUST BE COMPLETELY 
   ABOVE ANY FORM OF SUSPICION.  MUDEDE LOST THAT 
   TRUST AND RESPECT A DECADE AGO. . .  TOGETHER WITH 
   OTHERS, MUDEDE MUST BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR 
   WHATEVER HAPPENS IN THE POST-ELECTION PERIOD 
   ARISING FROM MUGABE'S CONTROVERSIAL AND LARGELY 
   UNRECOGNIZED VICTORY.  MUDEDE HAS FAILED ZIMBABWE 
   UNFORGIVABLY.  HE MUST RESIGN."

¶3.   UNDER HEADLINE "TIME TO REDIRECT ENERGIES," THE 
   GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED DAILY "THE HERALD" (03/18) 
   COMMENTS: 
 
   ". . .EMERGING FROM A HARD-FOUGHT PRESIDENTIAL 
   ELECTION ZIMBABWEANS SHOULD NOW PUT THE PAST MONTHS 
   BEHIND THEM AND REDIRECT THEIR ENERGIES TOWARDS 
   RECONSTRUCTING THE ECONOMY.  WE SHOULD ALL NOW PULL 
   IN THE SAME DIRECTION.  AS THE PRESIDENT SAID (IN 
   HIS INAUGURATION SPEECH ON MARCH 17), ALL 
   ZIMBABWEANS, INCLUDING MDC SUPPORTERS, MUST BE 
   UNITED TO WORK FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF ZIMBABWE. 
   SANCTIONS WILL HURT ALL THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY, 
   REGARDLESS OF POLITICAL PERSUASION.  FOREIGNERS 
   CANNOT INTERFERE IF ZIMBABWEANS CLOSE RANKS.  THE 
   MDC SHOULD DISABUSE ITSELF OF THE NOTION THAT 
   ZIMBABWEANS ARE ANGRY AND MIGHT RISE UP AGAINST THE 
   GOVERNMENT.  PEOPLE HAVE MOVED ON AND EXPECT THE 
   OPPOSITION PARTY TO BE RESPONSIBLE ENOUGH TO PLAY 
   ITS ROLE IN ZIMBABWE'S DEVELOPMENT. . .  THE 
   PROBLEMS WE FACE AS A NATION ARE MANY AND VARIED. 
   BUT IF ALL ZIMBABWEANS PLAY THEIR PART THEY CAN BE 
   OVERCOME."

   INTIMIDATED," THE BULAWAYO-BASED GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED 
   DAILY "CHRONICLE" (03/18) COMMENTS:

   WE KNOW THAT THE WESTERN COUNTRIES ARE ALREADY 
   TRYING TO BLACKMAIL PRESIDENT THABO MBEKI OF SOUTH 
   AFRICA.  WE WOULD BE NAVE AS A PEOPLE IF WE GAVE 
   IN TO THE WHIMS OF WHITE PEOPLE AT A TIME WHEN WE 
   SEEM ON COURSE TO REASSERT OUR INTEGRITY AS THE

   POLITICAL PARTY THAT HAS GROWN WILD IN SAVAGERY AND 
   LED BY AN OLD AND SENILE AUTOCRAT WITH THE 
   POLITICAL MORALITY OF A SEWER RAT.  THEY MUST 
   RECLAIM THEIR POWER TOGETHER WITH THEIR ELECTORAL 
   VICTORY.  THIS ENTAILS BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS, BUT 
   THERE IS NO EASY WAY TO FREEDOM.  ZIMBABWEANS MUST 
   CONFRONT AUTOCRACY WITH THE SAME RESOLUTION AND 
   DETERMINATION SIMILAR TO THE RUTHLESSNESS WITH 
   WHICH THE DESPOTIC REGIME HAS MAINTAINED A JACKBOOT 
   ON THEIR NECKS FOR SO LONG.  IT IS NO LONGER A 
   CHOICE OF GOVERNMENTS; IT IS NOW A PLAIN AND SIMPLE 
   CHOICE BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL; BETWEEN HOPE AND 
   DESPAIR; BETWEEN LIFE AND CERTAIN DEATH. . .  IN 
   THEIR VALIANT STRUGGLE AGAINST AUTOCRACY, 
   ZIMBABWEANS MUST TAKE COURAGE AND COMFORT IN THE 
   KNOWLEDGE THAT PEACE-LOVING AND DEMOCRATIC NATIONS 
   OF THE WORLD ARE BEHIND THEM.  THE REGIME CAN 
   CONTINUE TO MURDER, TORTURE, RAPE, BRUTALIZE, 
   DEHUMANIZE AND COMMIT ALL MANNER OF CRIMES AGAINST 
   HUMANITY.  BUT ONE THING IS CERTAIN: THE PEOPLE 
   SHALL PREVAIL IN THE END AND THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR 
   THIS OUTRAGE WILL ONE DAY HAVE TO ANSWER BEFORE A 
   COURT OF THE PEOPLE'S JUSTICE.  THERE IS NO 
   DICTATOR IN HISTORY, HOWEVER MIGHTY, WHO HAS 
   DEFEATED THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE.  A DESPOTIC REGIME 
   THAT IS DRENCHED IN THE BLOOD OF THE SLAUGHTERED 
   HUNDREDS, AND PEGGED ON THE FRESH SKELETONS OF 
   ZIMBABWEANS, MUST BE FOUGHT TO THE BITTER END. . . 
   ZIMBABWEANS MUST VOW THAT THERE WILL BE NO 
   COMPROMISE OR SURRENDER."

¶6.   UNDER HEADLINE "TSVANGIRAI SINKS INTO POLITICAL 
   OBLIVION," THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED WEEKLY "THE 
   SUNDAY MAIL" (03/17) COMMENTS: 
 
   "THE DUST WILL NOT SETTLE EASILY ON ZIMBABWE'S 
   WATERSHED ELECTION, WHICH SAW PRESIDENT MUGABE, THE 
   INDEFATIGABLE CHAMPION OF BLACK NATIONALISM, DEFEAT 
   MR. MORGAN TSVANGIRAI, THE NEW FACE OF NEO- 
   COLONIALISM IN AFRICA.  TSVANGIRAI'S DEFEAT HAD FAR- 
   REACHING EFFECTS NOT ONLY IN AFRICA BUT ALSO THE 
   WORLD OVER. . .  ZIMBABWE'S ELECTIONS WERE A TEST 
   CASE FOR THE POSSIBLE RE-EMERGENCE OF THE RE- 
   COLONIZATION OF AFRICA THROUGH THE IMPOSITION OF 
   PLIANT NEOCOLONIAL LEADERS.  THIS IS PERHAPS WHY 
   THERE IS SO MUCH RELIEF AND EXCITEMENT IN PAN- 
   AFRICAN CIRCLES FROM CAPE TO CAIRO AND SO MUCH 
   CRYING IN EUROPE AND AMERICA.  BUT THE DUST OF THE 
   ELECTION CONTINUES TO BE RAISED BY REPORTS SUCH AS 
   THE SHOCKINGLY MISINFORMED AND OUT OF LINE REPORT 
   OF THE COMMONWEALTH OBSERVER GROUP.  TO BE FAIR, 
   THE REPORT READS LIKE A MEMO FROM THE BRITISH 
   FOREIGN OFFICE AND IS TOTALLY OUT OF SYNC WITH 
   OTHER REPORTS OF OBSERVER TEAMS.  IT ONLY AGREES 
   WITH REPORTS FROM ONE OR TWO ORGANIZATIONS, WHICH 
   WERE FUNDED BY THE EUROPEAN UNION AND WERE THUS AN 
   EXTENSION OF BRITISH PROPAGANDA. . .  WHEN THE 
   COMMONWEALTH OBSERVER MISSION REPORT IS TAKEN 
   TOGETHER WITH STATEMENTS BY BRITISH PRIME MINISTER 
   MR. TONY BLAIR BEFORE THE ELECTIONS THAT THE 
   OBSERVER GROUP WOULD HAVE TO FIND THAT THE 
   ELECTIONS ARE NOT FREE AND FAIR, THEN THE WHOLE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HARARE  00698  02 OF 04  181109Z 
   REPORT BECOMES NOTHING BUT JUST A DAMP SQUIB. 
   WHILE ZIMBABWE'S ELECTIONS WERE NOT PERFECT, THEY 
   WERE SUBSTANTIALLY FREE AND FAIR. . .  MR. 
   TSVANGIRAI WAS DEFEATED BECAUSE HE DID NOT HAVE 
   MUCH TO SELL TO THE ELECTORATE. . . ." 
 
¶7.   UNDER HEADLINE "POLL 'VICTORY' MAY PROVE TO BE 
   MUGABE'S UNDOING," THE INDEPENDENT DAILY "THE DAILY 
   NEWS" (03/16) COMMENTS: 
 
   ". . .(PRESIDENT) MUGABE CANNOT URGE THE NATION TO 
   'BEAT SWORDS INTO PLOUGHSHARES,' WHICH HE RESORTED 
   TO AFTER HIS 1980 VICTORY, BECAUSE EVEN THAT CALL 
   WON'T HAVE A RING OF SINCERITY TO IT, AND EVEN IF 
   IT DID, FEW WOULD BE TAKEN IN BY IT. . .  MUGABE 
   NOW ALSO HAS TO DEAL WITH THE LAWLESSNESS HE 
   SANCTIONED AND CONDONED DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS. 
   IT WILL BE A CHALLENGE TO SEE IF HE HAS THE COURAGE 
   TO PUT HIS FOOT DOWN.  ANOTHER HURDLE HE MUST 
   OVERCOME IS HOW TO OBTAIN INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION 
   AND LEGITIMACY OF THE OUTCOME OF THE PRESIDENTIAL

   THE BULAWAYO-BASED GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED DAILY 
   "CHRONICLE" COMMENTS: 
 
   ". . .MOST AFRICAN STATES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE 
   OBSERVER TEAMS HAVE SINCE DECLARED THE POLLS FREE 
   AND FAIR.  THE IMPERIALIST WORLD-LED BY BRITAIN AND 
   THE UNITED STATES AND ITS LOCAL CHIHUAHUAS ON THE 
   OTHER HAND HAVE BEGGED TO DIFFER PRINCIPALLY 
   BECAUSE THEIR CANDIDATE, MDC LEADER MORGAN 
   TSVANGIRAI, LOST.  THIS CIRCUS HAS LEFT MANY PEOPLE 
   WONDERING WHETHER THE LEGITIMACY OF THE RESULT OF 
   THIS ELECTION IS BEING JUDGED ON THE BASIS OF 
   DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES AS WE ALL KNOW THEM OR SOME 
   'I HATE THE FACE' CRITERION. . .  WE ALL KNOW THAT 
   ZIMBABWE'S FORMER COLONIAL MASTER BRITAIN, THE 
   MAJOR SPONSOR OF MDC, HAD HOPED THAT MR. TSVANGIRAI 
   WOULD WIN AND THUS PAY THEM BACK BY REVERSING THE 
   LAND REFORM PROGRAM.  THE PEOPLE OF ZIMBABWE PUT 
   THEM TO SHAME BY VOTING FOR PRESIDENT MUGABE.  IN 
   DOING SO THE MESSAGE FROM THE PEOPLE WAS LOUD AND 
   CLEAR - WE WANT LAND.  NOW LIKE A DOG ON A LEASH, 
   MDC IS BEING TOLD TO COME UP WITH 'MASS ACTIONS' TO

   ATTACK ZIMBABWE.  LET IT BE KNOWN THAT ZIMBABWE HAS 
   THE CAPACITY AND CAPABILITY TO REPEL SUCH ATTACKS. 
   WE WANT TO URGE ZIMBABWEANS NOT TO BE USED AS 
   FODDER BY REFUSING TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE SO- 
   CALLED 'PROTESTS.'  WE WOULD LIKE TO APPLAUD 
   COUNTRIES SUCH AS SOUTH AFRICA, TANZANIA, NIGERIA, 
   NAMIBIA, ZAMBIA, CHINA AND KENYA. . .WHO HAVE 
   ALREADY ENDORSED THE ELECTIONS, FOR RESISTING THE 
   MACHINATIONS OF THE BRITISH AND THE AMERICANS. 
   THIS IS THE TIME FOR AFRICAN STATES TO UNITE 
   AGAINST BULLYING TACTICS BY THE WEST.  IT IS 
   UNFORTUNATE THAT SOME OF OUR AFRICAN BROTHERS SUCH 
   AS THE UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY GENERAL, MR. KOFI 
   ANNAN AND FORMER NIGERIAN PRESIDENT GENERAL 
   ABDULSALAMI ABUBAKAR WHO CHAIRED THE COMMONWEALTH 
   OBSERVER MISSION, HAVE DEVELOPED WEAK SPINES.  WE 
   BELIEVE THIS IS A SIMPLE QUESTION OF HE WHO PAYS 
   THE PIPER CALLS THE TUNE.  MR. ANNAN CANNOT BE SEEN 
   OPPOSING THE AMERICAN POSITION BECAUSE THE UN IS 
   HEAVILY BANKROLLED BY THE USA. . .  WE CANNOT BE 
   FOOLED BY PEOPLE WHO WANT TO HAVE THEIR CAKE AND 
   EAT IT.  THE PEOPLE OF ZIMBABWE HAVE SPOKEN AND THE 
   WORLD SHOULD RESPECT THEIR WILL.  AFTER ALL 
   PRESIDENT MUGABE WAS ELECTED TO LEAD ZIMBABWE NOT 
   THE USA OR BRITAIN."

   ROBERT MUGABE HAS ALREADY A PLAN ON THE BASIS OF 
   WHICH TO EFFECT A VISION OF THE POST-ELECTION
