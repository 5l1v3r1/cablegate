(U)  We contacted Turkish MFA officials May 28 and several 
times thereafter for responses to reftel questions.  MFA 
believes the Ministry of Justice does not have an established 
witness protection program and is checking further with 
colleagues in the Ministry of Interior regarding this topic. 
MFA is aware of the June 15 deadline.  We will send follow up 
cable on receipt of further information from GOT.
