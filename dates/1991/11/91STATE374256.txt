¶3.  TITLE:  LIBYA'S CONTINUING RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
TERRORISM 

BEGIN TEXT.  INTRODUCTION 

THIS WHITE PAPER IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE CONTEXT FOR THE 
ALLEGATIONS IN THE US AND SCOTTISH INDICTMENTS OF LIBYAN 

NATIONALS FOR THE BOMBING OF PAN AM FLIGHT 103 IN 
DECEMBER 1988.  TO THIS END, THE PAPER DISCUSSES THE 
ATTITUDE OF THE QADHAFI GOVERNMENT TOWARD TERRORISM AND 
OUTLINES LIBYAN OFFICIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR TERRORIST 
ACTS. 

BASED ON ANALYSIS OF LIBYAN BEHAVIOR OVER MANY YEARS, ON 
THE RESULTS OF INVESTIGATING THE BOMBING OF PAN AM 103 
SINCE 1988, AND ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE LIBYAN REGIME 
AND THE RELATIONS AMONG LEADING OFFICIALS IN THAT 
REGIME, WE CONCLUDE THAT THE BOMBING OF PAN AM 103 WAS 
NOT AN ABERRATION AND WAS AN ACTION AUTHORIZED BY THE 
LIBYAN GOVERNMENT.  LIBYA'S SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM BEGAN 
IN THE EARLIEST DAYS OF THE QADHAFI REGIME.  AS EARLY AS 
1972, LIBYAN LEADER MU'AMMAR QADHAFI PUBLICLY OFFERED TO 
HELP EXTREMIST MOVEMENTS -- INCLUDING THE PROVISIONAL 
IRISH REPUBLICAN ARMY AND THE BLACK POWER MOVEMENT IN 
THE UNITED STATES -- AND TO SUPPORT ANY GROUP IN THE 
MIDDLE EAST WILLING TO ATTACK ISRAEL.  QADHAFI 
DISPATCHED TERRORISTS TO ITALY IN 1973 TO SHOOT DOWN AN 
ISRAELI AIRLINER, AND AT LEAST AS EARLY AS 1975 ORDERED 
THE MURDER OF LIBYAN DISSIDENTS LIVING ABROAD.  ALTHOUGH 
DISSIDENTS HISTORICALLY HAVE POSED LITTLE -- IF ANY -- 
THREAT TO QADHAFI'S RULE, THE LIBYAN LEADER HAS 
CONCENTRATED ON ELIMINATING THEM.  ASSASSINATIONS TOOK 
PLACE IN THE EARLY AND MID-1980S AND INCLUDED TWO 
ATTEMPTS (ONE OF THEM SUCCESSFUL) AGAINST LIBYAN 
STUDENTS IN THE U.S. 

LIBYAN INVOLVEMENT IN AND SUPPORT OF TERRORISM EXPANDED 
THROUGHOUT THE EARLY 1980S.  TRIPOLI PROVIDED PASSPORTS 
TO ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION MEMBERS WHO ATTACKED THE EL AL 
TICKET COUNTER AT THE VIENNA AIRPORT IN DECEMBER, 1985. 
LIBYA ALSO SPONSORED THE BOMBING OF THE LA BELLE DISCO 
IN BERLIN IN APRIL 1986 THAT KILLED THREE PEOPLE, 
INCLUDING TWO US SERVICEMEN. 

OVER THE YEARS  EVEN AS LIBYAN AGENTS AND THEIR PROXIES 
PLANNED AND CARRIED OUT TERRORIST ATTACKS, QADHAFI 
REGULARLY SOUGHT TO CALM INTERNATIONAL CONCERNS THROUGH 
PUBLIC DENUNCIATIONS OF TERRORISM.  FOR EXAMPLE, IN 1977 
QADHAFI PLOTTED TO ASSASSINATE A US AMBASSADOR, JUST 
AFTER ASSURING PRESIDENT CARTER THAT HE SOUGHT GOOD 
RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES.  MOVEOVER, QADHAFI 
PERIODICALLY HAS ISSUED PUBLIC DENIALS OF HIS 
INVOLVEMENT IN TERRORISM WHILE HIS INTELLIGENCE 
APPARATUS WAS PREPARING FOR ACTS OF TERRORISM.  LIBYAN 
ACTION HAS NOT BEEN LIMITED TO ISRAELI AND WESTERN 
TARGETS.  IN THE MID-1980'S LIBYA BACKED PLOTS AGAINST 

PRESIDENT MUBARAK OF EGYPT, FORMER PRESIDENT NIMEIRI OF 
SUDAN, PRESIDENT MOBUTU OF ZAIRE' FORMER TUNISIAN 
PRESIDENT BOURGUIBA, AND FORMER PRESIDENT HABRE OF 
CHAD.  IN ADDITION TO USING AND SUPPORTING TERRORISM, 
QADHAFI ALSO HAS A LONG HISTORY OF TRYING TO SUBVERT 
GOVERNMENTS IN AFRICA, ASIA, AND LATIN AMERICA. 

 
THE RECORD OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS 
----------------------------------- 

THE 1986 AIRSTRIKE ON LIBYA BY THE UNITED STATES, 
COMBINED WITH OTHER INTERNATIONAL PRESSURES, DID NOT END 
TRIPOLI'S SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM.  FOLLOWING THE AIR 
ATTACK, QADHAFI BEGAN TO USE FRONT COMPANIES AND OTHER 
ORGANIZATIONS TO HIDE LIBYA'S HAND.  IN ADDITION, 
QADHAFI HAS PLACED A PREMIUM ON MASKING LIBYA'S SUPPORT 
FOR TERRORISM IN AN ATTEMPT TO AVOID JEOPARDIZING 
LIBYA'S ECONOMIC LINKS TO HIS AFRICAN NEIGHBORS AND 
MAJOR EUROPEAN TRADING PARTNERS. 

THE LIBYANS SPONSORED A SERIES OF ANTI-US OPERATIONS 
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE US AIRSTRIKES IN APRIL, 1986. 
TRIPOLI WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SHOOTING OF A US EMBASSY 
COMMUNICATOR IN SUDAN ON 15 APRIL 1986 AND FOR THE 
SHOOTING OF ANOTHER EMBASSY COMMUNICATOR IN SANAA, NORTH 
YEMEN, ON 25 APRIL 1986.  IN ADDITION, TWO LIBYANS WERE 
APPREHENDED ON 18 APRIL 1986 AS THEY ATTEMPTED TO ATTACK 
THE US OFFICERS CLUB IN ANKARA WITH GRENADES OBTAINED 
FROM THE LIBYAN PEOPLE'S BUREAU THERE.  THE LIBYANS 
CONFESSED THAT THEY WERE ORDERED TO CAUSE THE MAXIMUM 
NUMBER OF CASUALITIES, PARTICULARLY WOMEN AND CHILDREN. 

WE BELIEVE THAT LIBYA WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
DESTRUCTION OF PAN AM FLIGHT 103 OVER LOCKERBIE. 
SCOTLAND, ON 21 DECEMBER 1988, AND THAT SENIOR 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS INVOLVED IN PREVIOUS TERRORIST 
ATTACKS AROUND THE WORLD ORCHESTRATED THE OPERATION. 
FORENSIC EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT THE BOMB'S TIMER WAS 
UNIQUE TO LIBYAN INVENTORIES, AND AN OFFICIAL OF THE 
LIBYAN NATIONAL CARRIER, LIBYAN ARAB AIRLINES, USED HIS 
CREDENTIALS TO CIRCUMVENT SECURITY PROCEDURES IN MALTA 
TO ASSIST IN THE OPERATION. 

OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, LIBYA HAS PROVIDED 
ASSISTANCE TO PALESTINIAN TERRORISTS, ENABLING THEM TO 
LAUNCH ATTACKS AGAINST ISRAEL AND WESTERN TARGETS: 

-- IN MAY 1990, PALESTINE LIBERATION FRONT MEMBERS 
ATTEMPTED A SEABORNE RAID ON ISRAEL; THE OPERATION 
FAILED, AND FOUR TERRORISTS WERE KILLED AND 12 
CAPTURED.  LIBYA PROVIDED THE GROUP WITH TRAINING, 
SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT, WEAPONRY, AND THE MOTHERSHIP 
USED IN THE OPERATION. 

-IN JULY 1988, ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION (ANO) OPERATIVES 
ATTACKED THE GREEK CRUISE SHIP THE CITY OF POROS, 
KILLING NINE AND WOUNDING OVER 100 PEOPLE.  LIBYA 
PROVIDED THE WEAPONS USED IN THIS OPERATION. 

LIBYA HAS REGARDED AFRICA AS AN ATTRACTIVE ENVIRONMENT 
FOR ITS OPERATIONS AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SEVERAL 
ATTACKS THERE: 

--ON 30 OCTOBER 1991, A FRENCH JUDGE ISSUED 
INTERNATIONAL ARREST WARRANTS, CHARGING FOUR LIBYAN 
OFFICIALS WITH INVOLVEMENT IN THE BOMBING OF UTA FLIGHT 
772 IN SEPTEMBER 1989. 

--IN MARCH 1990, LIBYAN DIPLOMATS WERE EXPELLED FROM 
ETHIOPIA AFTER A BOMB EXPLODED IN THE HILTON HOTEL IN 
ADDIS ABABA, IN AN APPARENT ATTEMPT TO KILL THE ISRAELI 
AMBASSADOR WHO WAS STAYING THERE. 

--IN FEBRUARY 1988, TWO KNOWN LIBYAN TERRORISTS WERE 
ARRESTED IN DAKAR, SENEGAL, IN POSSESSION OF EXPLOSIVES 
AND WEAPONS. 

--IN OCTOBER 1987, A BOMB EXPLODED IN THE OFFICE OF 
WORLD VISION, A PRIVATE RELIEF ORGANIZATION OPERATING IN 
MOUDOU, CHAD.  LIBYAN DIPLOMATS BASED IN COTONOU, BENIN, 
ASSISTED THE TERRORISTS WHO CARRIED OUT THE ATTACK. 

--IN MARCH 1987, A BOMB EXPLODED AT THE CAFE 
"L'HISTORIL" IN DJIBOUTI, KILLING 11 AND WOUNDING 50. 
THE LIBYANS ORDERED A PALESTINIAN GROUP, THE POPULAR 
STRUGGLE FRONT, TO CONDUCT THE ATTACK OR RISK LOSING 
TRIPOLI'S FINANCIAL SUPPORT. 

THE LIBYANS HAVE SUPPORTED TERRORIST GROUPS IN EUROPE, 
PARTICULARLY THE PROVISIONAL IRISH REPUBLICAN ARMY 
(PIRA), WHICH COLONEL QADHAFI HAS CALLED A "POPULAR" 
NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENT.  THROUGHOUT THE MID-1980S 
LIBYA PROVIDED THE GROUP WITH ARMS.  LIBYA'S HAND WAS 
OPENLY REVEALED IN OCTOBER 1987, WHEN FRENCH AUTHORITIES 
INTERCEPTED A FREIGHTER, THE EKSUND, OFF THE COAST OF 
FRANCE AND SEIZED 150 TONS OF WEAPONS AND EXPLOSIVES 
DESTINED FOR THE PIRA.  LIBYA HAS ALSO PROVIDED 
FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE PIRA. 

SINCE APRIL 1986, LIBYAN ASSASSINS HAVE MURDERED THREE 
ANTI-QADHAFI LIBYAN DISSIDENTS RESIDING IN GREECE, 
ITALY, AND FRANCE.  TRIPOLI HAS CONTINUED TO TARGET 
OTHER EXILES DEEMED "OPPONENTS" OF THE LIBYAN 
GOVERNMENT. 

 
CURRENT SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM 
----------------------------- 

DESPITE THE EFFORTS OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, 
LIBYAN INVOLVEMENT IN TERRORISM TODAY REMAINS 
EXTENSIVE.  TRIPOLI IS ONE OF THE LARGEST FINANCIERS OF 
TERRORISTS WORLDWIDE, AND IT CONTINUES TO PERMIT 
TERRORIST GROUPS TO OPERATE AT CAMPS THROUGHOUT LIBYA. 

IN THE MIDDLE EAST THE LIBYANS CONTINUE TO SUPPORT A 
WIDE RANGE OF TERRORIST GROUPS: 

--THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION (ANO) -- WHICH HAS 
CONDUCTED OVER 100 TERRORIST ATTACKS RESULTING IN THE 
DEATHS OF MORE THAN 280 PEOPLE AND THE WOUNDING OF OVER 
650 SINCE ITS FOUNDING -- CONTINUES TO RECEIVE 
SIGNIFICANT LIBYAN SUPPORT.  THE GROUP IS HEADQUARTERED 
IN TRIPOLI, AND LIBYA PROVIDES THE ANO WITH MAJOR 
TRAINING FACILITIES AND SEVERAL MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. 

--QADHAFI PROVIDED WELL OVER 1 MILLION DOLLARS TO AHMED 
JABRIL'S POPULAR FRONT FOR THE LIBERATION OF 
PALESTINE-GENERAL COMMAND IN 1990.  THE GROUP WAS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BOMBINGS OF TWO US MILITARY TRAINS 
IN GERMANY IN 1987 AND 1988. 

--ELEMENTS OF THE PALESTINE LIBERATION FRONT (PLF) 
REMAIN BASED IN LIBYA AND RECEIVE FINANCIAL AND LOGISTIC 
SUPPORT FROM THE LIBYAN GOVERNMENT.  THE GROUP HAS A 
LONG HISTORY OF TERRORIST ATTACKS, INCLUDING THE 
HIJACKING OF THE CRUISE SHIP ACHILLE LAURO IN OCTOBER 
1985, WHICH RESULTED IN THE MURDER OF A WHEELCHAIR-BOUND 
AMERICAN TOURIST ON BOARD, AND THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED 
ATTACK ON A TEL AVIV BEACH. 

--LIBYA ALSO FUNDS SA'IQA AND ELEMENTS OF THE PALESTINE 
ISLAMIC JIHAD. 

LIBYAN SUPPORT FOR NON-PALESTINIAN GROUPS HAS BECOME 
INCREASINGLY SELECTIVE.  THE MAIN CRITERION APPEARS TO 
BE THE DEGREE TO WHICH A GROUP DEMONSTRATES A CAPABILITY 
AND WILLINGNESS TO ATTACK LIBYA'S ENEMIES WORLDWIDE, 
INCLUDING US AND OTHER WESTERN TARGETS. 

IN EUROPE, LIBYA MAINTAINS TIES TO THE PROVISIONAL IRISH 
REPUBLICAN ARMY (PIRA) DESPITE QADHAFI'S CLAIM EARLIER 
THIS YEAR TO HAVE ENDED SUPPORT FOR THE GROUP.  THE 
LIBYANS HAVE CONTACT WITH THE KURDISH SEPARATIST GROUP, 
THE PKK, WHICH HAS CONDUCTED NUMEROUS TERRORIST ATTACKS 
AGAINST TURKISH TARGETS. 

A PRINCIPAL RECIPIENT OF LIBYAN FINANCING IN ASIA IS THE 
COMMUNIST PARTY OF THE PHILIPPINES (CPP) AND ITS 
MILITARY WING, THE NEW PEOPLE'S ARMY (NPA)  WHICH HAS 
KILLED 10 AMERICANS SINCE 1987.  THE LIBYANS HAVE 
PROVIDED AT LEAST 7 MILLION DOLLARS TO THE CPP/NPA SINCE 
¶1987. 

IN LATIN AMERICA, THE LIBYANS CONTINUE TO SEARCH OUT 
GROUPS WILLING TO KILL AMERICANS.  FOR EXAMPLE, LAST 
YEAR TRIPOLI PAID THE HAITIAN LIBERATION ORGANIZATION 
OVER 20,000 DOLLARS TO CARRY OUT AN ATTACK AGAINST THE 
US EMBASSY IN PORT-AU-PRINCE; THE GROUP, HOWEVER FAILED 
TO ACCOMPLISH ITS MISSION.  LIBYA HAS UNSUCCESSFULLY 
TRIED TO RECRUIT THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION 
FRONT IN EL SALVADOR TO CONDUCT ANTI-WESTERN ATTACKS IN 
RETURN FOR MONEY. 

THE LIBYANS ALSO MAINTAIN CONTACT WITH OTHER TERRORIST 
GROUPS IN THE REGION, INCLUDING THE COSTA RICAN JUAN 
SANTA MARIA PATRIOTIC ORGANIZATION, TUPAC AMARU 
REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT IN PERU, AND THE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ 
PATRIOTIC FRONT IN CHILE. 

THE ANTI-IMPERIALISM CENTER (AIC) -- ALSO KNOWN AS 
MATHABA -- IS USED BY THE LIBYAN GOVERNMENT TO SUPPORT 
TERRORIST NETWORKS AND THUS PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN 
QADHAFI'S TERRORISM STRATEGY.  ESTABLISHED IN 1982 TO 
SUPPORT "LIBERATION AND REVOLUTIONARY GROUPS," THE AIC 
HAS SPONSORED A NUMBER OF STRIDENTLY ANTI-WESTERN 
CONFERENCES IN TRIPOLI.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE AIC'S 
MISSION IS TO IDENTIFY AND RECRUIT REVOLUTIONARIES FOR 
IDEOLOGICAL AND MILITARY TRAINING IN LIBYA.  DURING 
THEIR TRAINING AT AIC CAMPS, INDIVIDUALS ARE SELECTED 
FOR ADVANCED TRAINING, INCLUDING WEAPONS AND EXPLOSIVES, 
AND INDOCTRINATION. 

THE AIC IS HEADED BY MUSA KUSA, A QADHAFI CONFIDANT WHO 
IS ALSO LIBYA'S DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER.  WITH 
REPRESENTATIVES IN MANY LIBYAN EMBASSIES WORLDWIDE, THE 
AIC RUNS ITS OWN INDEPENDENT CLANDESTINE OPERATIONS AND 
DISBURSES PAYMENTS TO TERRORIST, INSURGENT, AND 
SUBVERSIVE GROUPS. 

 
TRAINING 
-------- 

COLONEL QADHAFI CONTINUES TO TRAIN MIDDLE EASTERN, 
AFRICAN, ASIAN, AND LATIN AMERICAN TERRORIST AND 
DISSIDENT ORGANIZATIONS AT CAMPS IN LIBYA, INCLUDING 
TRIPOLI.  THE LARGEST TRAINING CAMPS INCLUDE: 

--AL QALAH.  ABOUT 100 KILOMETERS SOUTHWEST OF TRIPOLI, 
IT IS THE PRINCIPAL ANO FACILITY IN LIBYA.  OVER THE 
PAST YEAR THE ANO HAS SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED THE SIZE OF 
THE CAMP. 

--SEVEN APRIL TRAINING CAMP.  LOCATED ABOUT NINE 
KILOMETERS FROM TRIPOLI  THE FACILITY PROVIDES TRAINING 
IN TERRORISM AND SUBVERSION TO AFRICANS AND LATIN 
AMERICANS, AS WELL AS TO LIBYAN MILITARY PERSONNEL. 

--SIDI BILAL PORT FACILITY.  TERRORISTS WHO CARRIED OUT 
THE MAY 1990 SEABORNE ATTACK AGAINST ISRAEL WERE TRAINED 
HERE. 

-BIN GHASHIR.  JUST SOUTH OF TRIPOLI, IT HAS BEEN USED 
TO TRAIN DISSIDENTS FROM AFRICA, ASIA, AND LATIN AMERICA 
IN TERRORIST/GUERRILLA TACTICS. 

--RAS AL HILAL.  PALESTINIAN TERRORIST GROUPS HAVE 
TRAINED AT THIS FACILITY. 

 
OUTLOOK FOR INVOLVEMENT IN TERRORISM 
------------------------------------- 

TERRORISM IS AN IMPORTANT INSTRUMENT OF LIBYAN FOREIGN 
POLICY.  LIBYA WILL USE TERRORISM TO FURTHER ITS AGENDA, 
PARTICULARLY WHEN COLONEL QADHAFI BELIEVES HE CAN 
PLAUSIBLY DENY INVOLVEMENT.  QADHAFI'S USE AND SUPPORT 
OF TERRORISM AS AN INSTRUMENT OF POLICY BELIE EFFORTS TO 
PERSUADE THE WORLD THAT HE DOES NOT SPONSOR TERRORIST 
ACTS.  LIBYAN OFFICIALS RESPONSIBLE FOR ACTS OF 
TERRORISM REMAIN IN SENIOR GOVERNMENT POSITIONS.  LAST 
YEAR QADHAFI APPOINTED IBRAHIM BISHARI, THE HEAD OF THE 
LIBYAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICE AND A KEY PLAYER IN LIBYAN 
TERRORIST ATTACKS IN THE 1980S. AS LIBYA'S FOREIGN 
MINISTER. 

 
THE CASE OF UTA 772 
------------------- 

ON 30 OCTOBER 1991, A FRENCH MAGISTRATE ISSUED 
INTERNATIONAL ARREST WARRANTS AGAINST FOUR LIBYAN 
OFFICIALS FOR THEIR ROLE IN THE BOMBING OF UTA FLIGHT 
772 IN SEPTEMBER 1989.  THE FLIGHT, WHICH WAS BOUND FROM 
BRAZZAVILLE, CONGO TO PARIS VIA NDJAMENA, CHAD EXPLODED 
OVER THE DESERT IN SOUTHEASTERN NIGER, KILLING ALL 171 
PASSENGERS AND CREW MEMBERS.  SEVEN AMERICANS, INCLUDING 
THE WIFE OF THE US AMBASSADOR TO CHAD, WERE AMONG THE 
PASSENGERS.  IN ADDITION TO THE WARRANTS AGAINST 
ABADALLAH SANUSSI (A RELATIVE OF QADHAFI AND 
SECOND-IN-COMMAND OF LIBYA'S INTELLIGENCE SERVICES), 
NAYLI IBRAHIM (ONE OF SANUSSI'S SUBORDINATES), ABD 
AL-AZRAGH, AND ABBAS MUSBAH (A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE 
LIBYAN SERVICES IN BRAZZAVILLE), THE JUDGE ISSUED 
INTERNATIONAL LOOKOUT NOTICES AGAINST MUSA KUSA (HEAD OF 
THE AIC AND DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER) AND ABD AL-SALAM 
ZADMA.  ACCORDING TO THE CHARGES, AL-AZRAGH, FIRST 
SECRETARY AT THE LIBYAN PEOPLE'S BUREAU IN BRAZZAVILLE, 
CONGO, RECRUITED THREE CONGOLESE TO PLANT A SUITCASE 
BOMB ON THE FLIGHT AND PROVIDED THEM WITH THE DEVICE. 
TWO OF THE THREE ARE NOW IN JAIL, ONE IN THE CONGO AND 
ONE IN ZAIRE. 

 
THE LIBYAN USE OF TERRORIST FRONTS 
---------------------------------- 

BECAUSE OF PUBLIC EXPOSURE OF THE ROLE OF LIBYAN 
PEOPLE'S BUREAUS (LPBS) IN INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM IN 
THE EARLY 1980S, LIBYA HAS OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS 
SHIFTED SOME OF ITS TERRORIST SUPPORT OPERATIONS TO 
OTHER INSTITUTIONS.  THESE INSTITUTIONS INCLUDE THE 
ISLAMIC CALL SOCIETY, STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS AND 
FRIENDSHIP SOCIETIES, AND LIBYAN FRONT COMPANIES.  BY 
USING MULTIPLE ORGANIZATIONS, LIBYA IS ABLE TO CONTINUE 
ITS ACTIVITIES EVEN IF ONE GROUP IS EXPOSED. 

FRONT COMPANIES PROVIDE LIBYAN OPERATIVES WITH COVER AND 
DECEPTION CAPABILITIES.  SOME OF THESE COMPANIES 
PROBABLY WERE ESTABLISHED AS LEGITIMATE CORPORATIONS, 
BUT THEY HAVE BEEN BLACKMAILED INTO COOPERATING WITH THE 
LIBYAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICES.  THE FRONT COMPANIES 
TYPICALLY ESTABLISH A PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL NATIONALS 
TO ENHANCE THEIR COVER.  THE COMPANIES' PARTNERS RARELY 
KNOW THAT THEY ARE DEALING WITH LIBYAN INTELLIGENCE 
OFFICERS OR LIBYAN BUSINESSMEN TAKING ORDERS FROM THE 
LIBYAN GOVERNMENT. 

LIBYAN FRONT COMPANIES KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN DIRECTLY OR 
INDIRECTLY INVOLVED IN TERRORIST OPERATIONS OVER THE 
PAST DECADE INCLUDE EXO-COMMERCE AND SARRA OR SARRAH. 
FOR EXAMPLE, UNDER THE GUISE OF A "LEGITIMATE" BUSINESS, 
THE BENIN-BASED SARRAH COMPANY INFILTRATED ARMS AND 
EXPLOSIVES INTO NEIGHBORING AFRICAN COUNTRIES FOR 

TERRORIST ACTS IN THE LATE 1980S.  ANOTHER FRONT 
COMPANY, THE GREEK-BASED GERMA SHIPPING AND STEVEDORING 
COMPANY, OWNED THE TINY STAR, THE MOTHERSHIP USED IN THE 
30 MAY 1990 PLF ATTACK ON ISRAEL, LAUNCHED FROM A LIBYAN 
PORT. 
 
IN ADDITION, OTHER BUSINESSES ARE SURROGATES OF THE 
LIBYAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICE.  NEUTRON INTERNATIONAL IS 
RUN BY MUSBAH WARFALLI, AN ARCHITECT OF LIBYAN ATTACKS 
AGAINST LIBYAN DISSIDENTS IN THE EARLY 1980S.  THE 
LIBYAN ARAB FOREIGN INVESTMENT COMPANY, OR LAFICO, IS 
WHOLLY OWNED BY THE LIBYAN GOVERNMENT AND IS SOMETIMES 
USED BY THE LIBYAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICE FOR COVER 
PURPOSES.  THE GENERAL ARAB AFRICAN COMPANY IS A MAJOR 
TRADING COMPANY SERVING AS A FRONT FOR LIBYAN 
INTELLIGENCE THROUGHOUT SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. 

EVEN LIBYAN BUSINESSMEN NOT READILY IDENTIFIED WITH THE 
LIBYAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICE OR A FRONT COMPANY HAVE BEEN 
USED IN OPERATIONS.  FOR EXAMPLE, IN JANUARY 1991, THE 
CHADIAN GOVERNMENT ARRESTED TWO LIBYAN AGENTS POSING AS 
BUSINESSMEN WHO WERE APPARENTLY ATTEMPTING TO SMUGGLE 
EXPLOSIVES INTO NDJAMENA.  WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE 
THAT MANY OTHER LIBYAN BUSINESSMEN AND BUSINESSES 
WORLDWIDE ARE LINKED TO THE LIBYAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICE. 

LIBYAN ARAB AIRLINES (LAA) IS THE GOVERNMENT-OWNED 
NATIONAL FLAG CARRIER, PROVIDING SCHEDULED PASSENGER AND 
CARGO SERVICE TO EUROPE, AFRICA, AND THE MIDDLE EAST. 
ALTHOUGH IT CONDUCTS LEGITIMATE ACTIVITIES, LAA HAS BEEN 
USED TO TRANSPORT ARMS, EXPLOSIVES, AND TERRORISTS. 
AMONG THE LIBYANS IMPLICATED IN SUPPLYING ARMS TO THE 
PIRA FROM 1985 TO 1987 WAS AN LAA EMPLOYEE.  AN LAA 
FLIGHT WAS USED IN THE AUGUST 1986 ESCAPE OF SIX 
TERRORISTS BELIEVED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 3 AUGUST 
ATTACK ON THE BRITISH BASE AT AKROTIRI, CYPRUS.  THE SIX 
WERE DISGUISED AS AIRLINE CREW MEMBERS, AND THE CAPTAIN 
MADE FALSE STATEMENTS TO AIRPORT AUTHORITIES ABOUT THE 
CREW'S SIZE TO DISGUISE THEIR PRESENCE.  THE AIRLINE 
REMAINS WELL POSITIONED TO ASSIST IN AN ATTACK, 
PARTICULARLY SINCE AT LEAST 30 PERCENT OF LAA EMPLOYEES 
POSTED ABROAD ARE LIBYAN INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS. 

THE ISLAMIC CALL SOCIETY (ICS), CREATED BY THE LIBYANS 
TO PROPAGATE ISLAM, IS USED FOR LEGITIMATE RELIGIOUS 
PURPOSES, BUT QADHAFI ALSO EXPLOITS THE ORGANIZATION'S 
PHILANTHROPIC REPUTATION TO ADVANCE HIS TERRORIST 
AGENDA.  THE ICS OFFICE IN CURACAO ASSISTED SEPARATISTS 
WHO BOMBED A GOVERNMENT OFFICE IN CAYENNE, FRENCH 

GUYANA, IN JANUARY, 1987.  FOR MUCH OF THE 1980S TRIPOLI 
USED ITS CALL SOCIETY OFFICE IN CONTONOU, BENIN, TO 
RECRUIT AND FUND TERRORISTS IN THE REGION. 

THE LIBYANS ALSO USE TRAVEL AGENCIES AROUND THE WORLD TO 
FACILITATE THE MOVEMENT OF LOCAL TERRORISTS TO LIBYA FOR 
ADVANCED TRAINING.  THE AGENCY NORMALLY BOOKS 
DISSIDENTS/TERRORISTS FOR TRAVEL THROUGH THIRD COUNTRIES 
SO THEIR ULTIMATE DESTINATION -- LIBYAN TERRORIST 
TRAINING CAMPS -- GOES UNDETECTED. 

 
COMPARING QADHAFI'S PUBLIC STATEMENTS ON TERRORISM WITH 
THE FACTS 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 

THE FICTION:  LIBYA DENOUNCES THE PROVISIONAL IRISH 
REPUBLICAN ARMY (PIRA) BOMBING IN ENNISKILLEN, NORTHERN 
IRELAND, IN WHICH 11 DIED AND 65 WERE INJURED.  JANA 10 
NOVEMBER 1987. 

THE FACT:  FRENCH AUTHORITIES INTERCEPTED A SHIP 
CARRYING 150 TONS OF ARMS AND EXPLOSIVES PROVIDED BY THE 
GOVERNMENT OF LIBYA AND DESTINED FOR PIRA IN IRELAND, 31 
OCTOBER 1987.  FOUR EARLIER SHIPMENTS SUCCESSFULLY 
ARRIVED AT THEIR DESTINATION. 

THE FICTION:  "THE GREAT JAMAHIRIYAH DOES NOT PRACTICE 
TERRORISM, NOR DOES IT SUPPORT IT."  COLONEL QADHAFI, 11 
FEBRUARY 1988. 

THE FACT:  PAN AM 103 EXPLODED OVER SCOTLAND  KILLING 
259 PERSONS ON BOARD, AND 11 CITIZENS OF LOCKERBIE ON 
THE GROUND.  LIBYAN INVOLVEMENT IS CERTAIN.  21 DECEMBER 
¶1988. 

THE FICTION:  LIBYA "HAS AFFIRMED AND CONTINUES TO 
AFFIRM THAT IT DENOUNCES AND OPPOSES TERRORISM."  JANA, 
9 APRIL 1989. 

THE FACT:  LIBYAN AGENTS, UNDER THE DIRECTION OF SENIOR 
OFFICIALS IN TRIPOLI, SABOTAGED UTA FLIGHT 772 WHICH 
EXPLODED OVER NIGER, KILLING ALL 171 PEOPLE ABOARD.  19 
SEPTEMBER 1989. 

THE FICTION:  REFERRING TO THE PLF RAID ON ISRAEL, LIBYA 
SAID THAT IT "HAS NO CONNECTION AND NO RELATION WITH 
THAT OPERATION."  (JANA, 6 JUNE 1990) 

THE FACT:  LIBYA MATERIALLY ASSISTED THE 30 MAY 1990 
RAID BY THE PLF ON ISRAEL, WHICH WAS LAUNCHED FROM THE 
LIBYAN COAST, BY PROVIDING THE OPERATIVES WITH EXTENSIVE 
TRAINING, MILITARY HARDWARE, AND NAVIGATIONAL EQUIPMENT. 

THE FICTION:  QADHAFI TOLD THE EGYPTIAN PRESS IN JUNE 
1991 THAT "ABU NIDAL IS NOT OPERATING AT ALL.  THE WORLD 
HASN'T HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT HIM FOR YEARS...ABU NIDAL IS 
NOT IN LIBYA." 

THE FACT:  THE ANO REMAINS HEADQUARTERED IN TRIPOLI, AND 
ABU NIDAL HIMSELF IS KNOWN TO MEET WITH COLONEL 
QADHAFI.  NOVEMBER 1991. 

 
HOW LIBYA FUNDS TERRORISTS 
-------------------------- 

THE LIBYANS USE A VARIETY OF MECHANISMS TO FINANCE 
TERRORIST GROUPS: 

--  TRIPOLI FREQUENTLY PASSES MONEY TO TERRORISTS WHO 
TRAIN IN COUNTRY.  VIRTUALLY ALL TERRORIST 
OPERATIVES WHO ARE TRAINED IN LIBYA RECEIVE, AT A 
MINIMUM, TRAVEL MONEY AND A SMALL STIPEND FOR 
PERSONAL EXPENSES. 

--  LIBYAN PEOPLE'S BUREAUS AND THE ANTI-IMPERIALISM 
CENTERS ARE USED TO TRANSFER FUNDS TO TERRORISTS. 

--  RADICAL PALESTINIAN GROUPS OFTEN RECEIVE LIBYAN 
FUNDING THROUGH BANK ACCOUNTS, PARTICULARLY IN THE 
MIDDLE EAST. 

--  ON RARE OCCASIONS THE LIBYANS HAVE USED COURIERS TO 
DELIVER MONEY TO TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS;  THE 
TRANSFER USUALLY OCCURS IN A THIRD COUNTRY. 

 
LIBYAN TRAINING CAMPS 
---------------------- 

LIBYA HAS TRAINED PALESTINIAN AND OTHER TERRORISTS IN 
COUNTRY SINCE THE EARLY 1970S.  IN ADDITION TO THE 
PRINCIPAL FACILITIES IN AND AROUND TRIPOLI, OVER THE 
PAST TWO DECADES THE LIBYANS HAVE OPERATED SMALLER 
TRAINING CAMPS DISPERSED THROUGHOUT THEIR COUNTRY.  ON 
SOME OCCASIONS, TERRORISTS ARE TRAINED AT LIBYAN 
MILITARY BASES.  FOR EXAMPLE, IN 1988 MEMBERS OF THE 
RADICAL PALESTINIAN GROUP, THE POPULAR STRUGGLE FRONT, 
TRAINED AT AN AIR FORCE BASE IN THE AOUZOU REGION. 
MEMBERS OF THE PFLP-GC ALSO ARE KNOWN TO HAVE TRAINED IN 
LIBYAN MILITARY CAMPS. 

NON-PALESTINIAN GROUPS THAT HAVE RECEIVED TRAINING IN 
LIBYA IN RECENT YEARS INCLUDE THE ECUADORIAN ALFARO 
VIVE, CARAJO ORGANIZATION, COLOMBIA'S M-19  THE HAITIAN 
LIBERATION ORGANIZATION, THE CHILEAN MANUEL RODRIGUEZ 
PATRIOTIC FRONT, THE ARMENIAN SECRET ARMY FOR THE 
LIBERATION OF ARMENIA, AND THE JAPANESE RED ARMY. 

TRAINEES FROM ASIA, LATIN AMERICA, AND AFRICA OFTEN GO 
TO LIBYA LEGALLY, USUALLY PRETENDING TO BE STUDENTS. 
SOMETIMES, THIRD WORLD NATIONALS TRAVEL TO LIBYA FOR 
WHAT THEY BELIEVE TO BE LEGITIMATE SCHOOLING, SUCH AS 
TECHNICAL OR RELIGIOUS TRAINING.  WHEN THEY ARRIVE, 
HOWEVER, THEY FIND THEMSELVES MET AT THE AIRPORT BY 
SOLDIERS, PLACED ON A TRUCK, AND TRANSPORTED TO A 
TERRORIST/DISSIDENT TRAINING CAMP.  THOSE STUDENTS 
HOSTILE TO LIBYAN OVERTURES ARE SUMMARILY DEPORTED AND 
BRANDED AS UNWORTHY STUDENTS. 

EXTREMISTS TRAVEL TO LIBYA USING OTHER METHODS AS WELL. 
FOR EXAMPLE, RADICALS FROM MAURITIUS TRAVELED TO TRIPOLI 
IN 1987 OSTENSIBLY TO ATTEND A YOUTH CONFERENCE. 
INSTEAD, THEY WENT TO A TERRORIST TRAINING CAMP. 

 
QADHAFI AND KIDNAPPING 
----------------------- 

THE HOLLOWNESS OF QADHAFI'S RHETORIC IS BEST ILLUSTRATED 
BY LIBYA'S LONGSTANDING INVOLVEMENT IN KIDNAPPING, 
DESPITE HIS REGULAR DENUNCIATIONS OF SUCH ACTS.  IN 1978 
LIBYAN INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS KIDNAPPED IMAM MUSA SADR, 
THE SPIRITUAL LEADER OF THE LEBANESE SHIA COMMUNITY, 
JUST AFTER HE ARRIVED IN TRIPOLI.  MUSA SADR EVENTUALLY 
DIED IN LIBYAN CAPTIVITY.  THROUGHOUT THE 1980S QADHAFI 
PUBLICLY DENOUNCED THE ILLEGAL DETENTION OF HOSTAGES BY 
EXTREMIST GROUPS IN LEBANON.  YET IN APRIL 1986, LIBYA 
BOUGHT AND ARRANGED FOR THE MURDER OF THREE WESTERN 
HOSTAGES IN LEBANON, INCLUDING AMERICAN PETER KILBURN. 
MORE RECENTLY  IN NOVEMBER, 1987 THE ABU NIDAL 
ORGANIZATION (ANO) HIJACKED THE YACHT SILCO IN 
INTERNATIONAL WATERS.  THE HOSTAGES--BELGIAN AND FRENCH 
NATIONALS--WERE RELEASED IN STAGES, WITH THE LAST 
DETAINEES FREED JANUARY 1991.  THE YACHT WAS SEIZED BY 
ANO ELEMENTS UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE LIBYAN 
INTELLIGENCE SERVICE, AND SOME OF THE HOSTAGES WERE EVEN 
HELD ON LIBYAN SOIL.  MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.
