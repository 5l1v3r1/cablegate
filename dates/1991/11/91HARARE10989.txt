VETERAN ANTI-APARTHEID ACTIVIST WHO WAS SEVERELY INJURED 
IN A BOMB BLAST IN HARARE IN 1987.  BRICKHILL IS SUING

THEY ARE SEEKING A COURT ORDER TO HAVE THE TAPES AND

¶D. ZIMBABWE'S RESPONSE TO INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
¶6.  DURING AND AFTER THE CONFLICT IN THE GULF, THE 
GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE PROVIDED ARMED SECURITY PERSONNEL

MISSION.  TWO IRAQIS SUSPECTED OF PLOTTING A TERRORIST 
ACT AGAINST THE AMERICAN EMBASSY WERE DEPORTED BY THE 
GOVERNMENT IN JANUARY. 
 
¶7.  ONLY ONE TERRORIST INCIDENT HAS TAKEN PLACE IN 
ZIMBABWE IN 1991.  A SMALL BOMB EXPLODED INSIDE THE 
HARARE SHERATON HOTEL ON JULY 20, CAUSING EXTENSIVE 
DAMAGE TO THE HOTEL'S FIRST THREE FLOORS, WHICH HOUSE 
RESTAURANTS, CONFERENCE ROOMS, AND SHOPS.  THREE PEOPLE 
WERE INJURED, TREATED AT LOCAL HOSPITALS, AND RELEASED. 
THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE SUSPECTS THAT SOUTH AFRICAN 
ELEMENTS OR MIDDLE EASTERN GOVERNMENT AGENTS CARRIED OUT 
THE BOMBING.  THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT SUSPECTS THAT 
THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT WAS INVOLVED IN THIS INCIDENT. 
 
¶8.  TWO LIBYANS WERE DEPORTED FROM ZIMBABWE IN 1991. 
ACCORDING TO AN ARTICLE IN THE NOVEMBER 3 EDITION OF THE 
HARARE SUNDAY TIMES, THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE DEPORTED 
THE TWO LIBYANS IN AUGUST 1991 FOR "SECURITY REASONS." 
THE MEN--ABDUSSALIM ELGMATT, AN EDITORIAL COORDINATOR OF 
THE WORLD MATHABA MAGAZINE, AND ALI KHALEF, A 
CLERK--WERE DEPORTED ON AUGUST 22.  ELGMATT HAD PLANNED 
TO CONDUCT INTERVIEWS WITH AFRICAN HEADS OF STATE, 
INCLUDING PRESIDENT MUGABE, AND LEADERS OF SOUTHERN 
AFRICAN LIBERATION MOVEMENTS.  THE ZIMBABWEAN EMBASSY IN 
TRIPOLI ISSUED THE TWO MEN VISAS.  IN JUNE 1989, THE 
THEN LIBYAN AMBASSADOR, MOHAMMED ISAMADAH, WAS ALSO 
EXPELLED FOR SECURITY REASONS. 
 
¶E. MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN 1991 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
¶9.  ALTHOUGH THERE WERE NO CROSS BORDER ATTACKS IN 1991, 
FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS THE MOZAMBICAN NATIONAL RESISTANCE 
(MNR OR RENAMO) HAS OPERATED ACROSS THE 
MOZAMBIQUE-ZIMBABWE BORDER, COMMITTING ATROCITIES ON 
BOTH SIDES.  THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE RESPONDED BY 
DEPLOYING TROOPS ALONG THE EASTERN BORDER AND INTO PARTS 
OF MOZAMBIQUE TO COMBAT THE BANDITS.  IN SEPTEMBER 1991, 
THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE AND USAID AGREED TO JOINTLY 
PROGRAM UP TO US$500,000 TO CONSTRUCT RECEPTION CENTERS 
FOR REFUGEES FLEEING THE CONFLICT. 
 
¶F. ZIMBABWEAN SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
¶10.  ZIMBABWE DOES NOT SUPPORT INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. 
HOWEVER, THE PLO IS ACCORDED FULL DIPLOMATIC STATUS WITH 
AN ACCREDITED AMBASSADOR WHO IS THE DEAN OF THE 
DIPLOMATIC CORPS.  THE GOVERNMENT RECOGNIZES THE 
SO-CALLED STATE OF PALESTINE. 
 
¶G. PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF TERRORISM 
-------------------------------------------- 
¶11.  ALTHOUGH ZIMBABWE HAS GOOD RELATIONS WITH CUBA, 
IRAN, NORTH KOREA, AND THE PLO, IT HAS NOT MADE ANY 
PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING 
COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE. 
 
¶H.  SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
¶12.  THE GULF WAR HAS LED THE GOVERNMENT TO CHANGE ITS 
ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM AND TERRORIST-SUPPORTING 
STATES OVER THE PAST YEAR.  RELATIONS WITH IRAQ, IN 
PARTICULAR, HAVE COOLED, AS HAVE RELATIONS WITH CUBA AND 
LIBYA.
