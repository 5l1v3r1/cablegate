¶1.  IN A STATEMENT ISSUED ON THE EVENING OF MARCH 26, 
EGYPTIAN MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD SUPREME GUIDE HAMED ABU 
AL-NASR ISSUED A STATEMENT ON BEHALF OF HIS ORGANIZATION 
DENOUNCING THE "MALICIOUS PLOT" THAT HAS PRODUCED THE 
INVASION OF KUWAIT, THE DESTRUCTION OF IRAQ'S 
CAPABILITIES, AND THE POSSIBLE FRAGMENTATION OF IRAQ.  THE 
STATEMENT PREDICTABLY ASCRIBES THE REGION'S PROBLEMS TO A 
LACK OF ISLAMIC RULE.  TEXT OF STATEMENT FOLLOWS IN PARA 2. 
 
¶2. BEGIN TEXT: 
 
          A STATEMENT REGARDING THE EVENTS IN IRAQ 
 
THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, DISTRESSED BY WHAT HAPPENED IN 
KUWAIT DUE TO THE IRAQI INVASION AND THE (ATTENDANT) 
WRECKAGE, DESTRUCTION, AND HUMILIATION OF THE KUWAITI 
PEOPLE, AND DISTRESSED BY THE COMPLETE DESTRUCTION TO 
WHICH THE ARMY AND VITAL UTILITIES OF THE FRATERNAL IRAQI 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED AT THE HANDS OF THE AMERICAN 
AND FOREIGN FORCES, DENOUNCE THE VICIOUS PLOT TO FINISH 
OFF WHAT REMAINS OF THE COHESION OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE AND 
TO SEGMENT IRAQ INTO WEAK STATELETS. 
 
THIS WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED HAD IRAQ BEEN RULED ACCORDING 
TO ISLAMIC SHURA, HEADED BY A GOD-FEARING RULER.  THE 
DICTATOR OF IRAQ WOULD NOT (HAVE BEEN ABLE TO) DESTROY THE 
LAND AND MEN OF HIS COUNTRY BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER THE 
WAR. 
 
THE AMERICAN AND FOREIGN FORCES IN IRAQ AND THE GULF ARE 
PLAYING A SLY, DESTRUCTIVE ROLE IN OUR ARAB REGION.  THE 
MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD STRESSES THAT, IN ORDER TO PRESERVE 
HUMAN RIGHTS, THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE (ARAB) NATIONS, AND 
THEIR STABILITY AND PROGRESS, THOSE FORCES MUST DEPART 
(ARABIC "RAHEEL").  WE FURTHER IMPLORE THE MEN OF THE ARAB 
NATION TO RETURN TO ISLAM AS A STRAIGHT PATH AND MEANS BY 
WHICH THE ARAB NATION CAN STAND AS A SINGLE RANK BEFORE 
THE DECEIT OF THE ENEMIES AND THE GREEDY. 
 
THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD IS CERTAIN THAT THE ABANDONMENT OF 
ISLAMIC ACTION AND "SHARI'A" ARE BEHIND WHAT HAPPENED IN 
KUWAIT AND IRAQ, (AS WELL AS) WHAT IS OCCURRING NOW, AND 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE. 
 
SALVATION LIES IN RETURNING TO GOD AND HIS RULE. 
 
"GOD WILL ACHIEVE HIS ORDER, BUT MOST PEOPLE DO NOT 
REALIZE THIS..." (QURANIC QUOTE)
