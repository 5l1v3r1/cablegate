SUBJECT: TURKISH DEMARCHE RESPONSE: UNGA RESOLUTIONS ON THE 
SITUATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND CHILDREN IN LEBANON 
 
REF: STATE 176793 
 
¶1. (SBU) The Turks share our concerns regarding the lack of 
balance in the NAM-sponsored UNGA resolutions related to the 
situation of children and human rights in Lebanon.  We 
delivered reftel points October 26 to Turkish MFA Middle East 
Department Officer Cem Ulusoy, following a three-day end of 
Ramadan holiday. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ulusoy said MFA had already instructed its mission 
in New York to seek a more balanced approach on the 
resolutions, to take into account the suffering of all 
victims, including children, in both Lebanon and Israel. 
Ulusoy stressed that as an EU candidate country Turkey will 
coordinate its position with the EU.  He also noted, however, 
that it would be difficult for Turkey to vote against the 
resolutions, particularly the one related to the situation of 
children.  Ulusoy assured us the GOT's mission in New York 
will be working to seek a more reasonable approach that can 
attract broad support.
