¶1. (SBU) Summary: To follow-up on the GOT's September 4 
demarche (ref b) expressing dismay at USG-sponsored events 
showing the PBS Frontline film "Sex Slaves," we met with MFA 
DDG for Expatriate Turks, Migration, Asylum and Property 
Issues Akif Ayhan and Department Head Melih Ulueren on 
October 3.  We outlined points shared first bilaterally in 
Washington on September 15 on USG efforts to place the video 
into context in terms of Turkey's anti-trafficking efforts 
(ref c).  We emphasized UNVIE's successful showing that 
included the Turkish Ambassador's participation (ref a). 
Ayhan expressed continued concern that the video depicted 
Turkey in an overly negative light that could harm both the 
GOT's ability to fight trafficking in persons (TIP) and 
Turkey's image abroad.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ayhan thanked us for previous USG assistance to the 
International Organization for Migration (IOM) 
anti-trafficking program in Turkey and effective ongoing 
bilateral and multilateral cooperation to fight TIP.  Ayhan 
said he understood the value in such efforts to raise TIP 
awareness and encourage increased donor and government 
resources to fight the problem. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Ayhan warned, however, that continued widespread 
screening of the video to large audiences could have a 
negative effect on Turkey's ability to fight trafficking. 
The video shows Turkish police and customs officials in a 
very negative and unbalanced light, akin to the distorted 
depiction of Turkish prisons in the 1978 movie "Midnight 
Express," according to Ayhan.  Ayhan also noted that dramatic 
flourishes in the film such as Middle Eastern theme music and 
dark lighting did not reflect the real Turkey and damaged its 
image. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The MFA's concern, Ulueren said, was three-fold. 
One, if Turkish security officials viewed the video and 
learned of the USG role in its dissemination (ref d), he 
would be concerned about their inclination to continue 
vigorously fighting the TIP problem in Turkey.  Security 
officials can be reactionary and will respond more 
effectively to encouragement and praise rather than 
unbalanced attacks or inaccuracies.  As an example, Ayhan 
pointed to the controversy earlier this year that harmed 
cooperation between Turkish National Police (TNP) and IOM 
when the TNP believed that IOM grossly exaggerated the 
numbers of trafficking victims (ref e).  Two, if the Turkish 
public found out about the USG role, the backlash would harm 
GOT efforts to fight trafficking and increase 
anti-Americanism in Turkey.  Three, widespread showings of 
the video regionally could harm the tourism industry, 
particularly with Russia and Ukraine. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Ayhan and Ulueren requested that the film be shown 
to expert audiences who would benefit from its message rather 
than more general audiences for whom the depiction of Turkey 
might harm overall Turkish interests, particularly its 
tourism industry.  Both asked that the message sent by 
Washington to posts about Turkey's anti-trafficking efforts 
be emphasized.  For example, Ayhan asked whether a showing of 
the video in Constanta, Romania at an American Corner (NFI) 
contained these contextual points.  He also asked whether the 
decision to share the video with all posts was 
well-coordinated inside the Department with respect to 
potential political ramifications. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment:  As the lead entity in charge of Turkey's 
government-wide anti-trafficking task force, the MFA is at 
the forefront of aggressive action against trafficking in 
Turkey.  The MFA's concerns about possible reactions from 
security forces and the public are not knee-jerk; they are 
real.  Post appreciates the Department's decision to provide 
posts with contextual information on Turkey's fight against 
TIP to address Turkish concerns (ref c).
