SUBJECT: 7th Rotation of Mongolian Troops Departs for Iraq 
 
¶1.  One hundred Mongolian troops departed today for Iraq, where they 
will provide force protection at Camp Echo for Polish troops in the 
Multinational Force.  The six month deployment is Mongolia's 7th 
rotation of troops to Iraq since 2003.  The dawn departure ceremony 
was attended by the Charge, and presided over by the Vice Defense 
Minister and Deputy Chief of General Staff (note: both the Minister 
and Chief of Staff are out of the country). 
 
¶2.  As well as Iraq, Mongolia's other current or upcoming 
peacekeeping troop deployments abroad include: 
 
-- Afghanistan: 21 artillery trainers supporting OEF.  The sixth 
deployment since 2003 will begin in mid October.  This is the 
largest deployment; previous deployments have been about a dozen 
trainers.  The deployment length is six months. 
 
-- Sierra Leone: 250 soldiers under UN command, guarding the 
international war crimes tribunal.  The second six month rotation 
began in July. 
 
-- Belgium, en route to Kosovo:  A 32-troop team left two days ago 
to begin two months of training in Belgium, which will be followed 
by a three month deployment alongside Belgian soldiers in the NATO 
peacekeeping mission in Kosovo.  This is Mongolia's second 
deployment to Kosovo; the first deployment of 36 soldiers began a 
six month rotation in late 2005. 
 
¶3.  In addition, the Mongolian military has discussed deploying 100 
troops to Afghanistan under Turkish command.  At the October 3 
ceremony, the acting chief of the Peacekeeping Operations Department 
in Mongolia's Armed Forces (MAF) told Economic/Political Chief that 
this was now under consideration for sometime next year.  The MAF 
had proposed a rotation this year, he said, but delays in 
consideration at the political level in the government had pushed 
back the possible deployment date.
