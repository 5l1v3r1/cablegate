¶1. (SBU)   Poloff delivered reftel demarche and non-papers to 
Spanish MFA Deputy Office Director for Human Rights Cecilia 
Robles Cartes on August 13.  Robles said that she understood 
the tripartite position on the HRC's text for the 
declaration, but she indicated that Spain would support the 
declaration.  Robles said that Spain has been involved in the 
drafting process since it began 11 years ago.  The Spanish 
feel it is important to have a declaration, even if it is not 
perfect.  Robles said that the declaration has come a long 
way from its starting point, with significant improvements 
over previous drafts. 
 
¶2. (SBU)   Robles said that Spain would prefer to see the 
declaration receive a consensus approval, noting that it now 
appears that this will not be possible.  She characterized 
some of the U.S. criticisms as over-interpretations, and she 
noted that Latin America would not be supporting the text if 
it thought U.S. concerns were sound.  Poloff asked her to 
consider the non-papers.  Australia and New Zealand have not 
approached the MFA on the topic since the HRC vote.
