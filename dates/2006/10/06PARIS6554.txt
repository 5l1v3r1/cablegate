REF: STATE 152063 
 
¶1.  (SBU) In response to reftel request, post has created an 
interagency team  on trade-related issues.  The team includes 
representatives from the Economic Section, Foreign Commercial 
Services/U.S. Department of Commerce, and Agriculture.  It will 
work closely with officers posted in France's two Consulate 
Generals and five American Presence Posts (APPs).  This interagency 
team will  meet regularly to discuss relevant and high priority 
trade issues in France, and provide guidance to Embassy leadership. 
Establishment of the team codifies informal practices that have 
been 
in place for some time. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Point of contact to coordinate post  compliance 
reporting: 
John Hennessey-Niland, Trade Officer, Hennessey-NilandJ@state.gov, 
phone: 33-1-4312-2222. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In addition to the activities of post  Trade Monitoring 
and 
Compliance Committee, relevant Embassy sections work closely with 
U.S 
industry representatives and Washington agencies to expand market 
access. 
USDA representatives at post report regularly on trade policy 
concerns 
through USDA  Global Agriculture Information Network (GAIN) and 
the 
annual Trade Policy Monitoring Report (TPMR). FCS communicates 
regularly 
with the DOC/ITA Market Access and Compliance Division and the 
Manufacturing and Services Division, and coordinates its activities 
with relevant staff at Embassy Paris. 
Post notes that trade relations between the United States and France 
fall 
under the competence of the European Union and not the French 
Government.
