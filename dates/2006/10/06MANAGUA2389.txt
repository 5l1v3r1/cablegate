SUBJECT: NICARAGUA DOES NOT BACK OAS RESOLUTION, WILL 
RECONSIDER STATEMENTS REGARDING USE OF WALL TO ENSURE U.S. 
BORDER SECURITY 
 
REF: STATE 176810 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli. Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
(C)  On October 25, DCM delivered reftel points to acting 
Foreign Minister Javier Williams Slate.  Due to Williams 
Slate's absence from Managua, Post was unable to deliver the 
demarche before today.  While acknowledging that the 
Nicaraguan government did not lend itself to supporting a 
resolution against the United States, DCM impressed upon 
Williams Slate that Nicaraguan Ambassador to the OAS 
Velasquez's comments comparing the U.S. border project to the 
Berlin Wall were unconstructive.  The DCM noted that in 
addition to improving its border security, the United States 
is in the process of reforming its immigration policy to make 
it clearer and fairer.  Williams Slate will discuss our 
concerns with  Velasquez and the Foreign Minister.
