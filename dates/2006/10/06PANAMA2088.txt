SUBJECT: PANAMA SEEKS BALANCE ON NAM LEBANON RESOLUTION 
 
REF: STATE 176793 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Panama will seek a balanced approach on 
Israel/Lebanon issues but cannot guarantee it will vote 
against the NAM resolution on Lebanese children's human 
rights, MFA Sub-Director for Exterior Politics Vladimir 
Franco told Poloff October 24.  Franco said Panama could not 
decide its vote without reading the text of the proposed NAM 
resolution. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Franco emphasized that Panama does not necessarily 
support all NAM actions and reiterated Panama's role as a 
balancing voice within the organization.  However, Franco 
said it was difficult for Panama to seek any kind of balance 
unless Israel complies with its obligations from previous UN 
resolutions.  If Israel does not fulfill its obligations, 
there can be no balance, added Franco.  He agreed to pass the 
U.S. non-paper to the MFA Director of Organization Affairs.
