SUBJECT: SECURITY MINISTER TO VISIT U.S. SOUTHERN COMMAND 
AND NEW MEXICO IN SEARCH OF ASSISTANCE 
 
REF: SAN JOSE 2113 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Mark Langdale per 1.4 (d). 
 
¶1.  (C) Minister of Public Security Fernando Berrocal has 
requested Embassy assistance in organizing an official visit 
to U.S. Southern Command, preferably on Wednesday, November 
15, 2006.  The visit would coincide with an official visit 
with Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico that will take 
place November 12-14.  If the visit to SouthCom is approved, 
Berrocal would return to Costa Rica on November 16, 2006. 
The purpose of both visits is to explore possibilities for 
security assistance to Costa Rica.  Berrocal has indicated to 
local media that he will sign an assistance agreement with 
Richardson during his visit to New Mexico. 
 
¶2.  (C) According to his staff, the agreement Berrocal wishes 
to sign is a State Partnership Program (SPP) agreement in 
which the U.S. National Guard, in coordination with SouthCom, 
would provide assistance to Costa Rica through exercises and 
training opportunities.  The Embassy supported Costa Rica's 
request to participate in the SPP (although we have no 
opinion as to whether New Mexico is the proper partner for 
Costa Rica--see reftel).  According to informal indications 
from J-5 at SouthCom, approval of a New Mexico-Costa Rica SPP 
program is likely and should occur in time for the November 
visit. 
 
¶3. (U) ACTION REQUEST:  Please advise status of and likely 
timetable for SPP decision for Costa Rica.
