SUBJECT: POST WRAP-UP REPORT ON NTV'S TV CO-OP 
 
 
¶1.  Summary: A TV co-op program with Turkish all-news TV station NTV 
resulted in five original documentary programs covering US-Turkey 
trade relations, US-Turkey defense relations, Cyprus policy, the 
fourth anniversary of the September 11 attacks, and western US 
history and culture. In addition, the station produced ten short 
segments on US border security and control, as well as several short 
pieces on cultural events. The pieces aired between August and 
November, 2005, some during prime time and some during the day. 
While there are no reliable rating figures commercially available 
for individual NTV programs, among Turkey's four all-news 
broadcasters, NTV dominates the sector with a 56% prime time market 
share. The TV co-op opportunity was seen as valuable by the NTV 
team. End Summary. 
 
¶2. TV Co-op Production: The NTV team produced five documentary 
segments and over 10 short pieces during two separate trips to the 
US, the first from June 5 to June 19, 2005, and the second from 
August 28 to September 12, 2005.  The three-person crew visited 
Washington DC, Florida, North Dakota, Texas and New York to meet 
with government officials, artists, dancers, NGO officials and 
ordinary citizens. The resulting segments provided a favorable 
depiction of the US, covering a wide variety of topics, including 
"US Border Policy," "US-Turkish Trade Relations" and "The Wild 
West." 
 
¶3. Program Descriptions: 
 
- Wild West documentary, featuring interviews with residents, 
historians and academics in North Dakota, aired in conjunction with 
the US TV series "Into the West" (59 minutes, 24 seconds) 
- US-Turkey Trade Relations, featuring interviews with government 
officials and business people (19 minutes 46 seconds) 
- US-Turkish Defense Relations (24 minutes 30 seconds) 
- Interview with former US Special Coordinator for Cyprus, Thomas 
Weston (25 minutes, 7 seconds) 
- Fourth Anniversary of September 11 attacks, live broadcast from 
New York City, featuring interviews with visitors to Ground Zero, an 
historian, a downtown New York small business owner, and coverage of 
the commemoration ceremony (About 20 minutes) 
- A program covering a variety of topics: lobbying in America, US 
border security, the Seattle Bumbershoot Arts Festival, belly 
dancing and square dancing in Dallas and the NASA Visitors Center in 
Houston (14 minutes) 
- Border security and border control, including interviews on the 
Canadian and Mexican borders (10 segments, averaging 2-4 minutes 
each) 
 
¶4. Viewer Reaction: NTV received extensive positive feedback from 
viewers. The "Wild West" segments received special attention, as 
several newspapers reported on the program including 
Islamist-oriented daily "Yeni Safak." Pairing the series with 
broadcasts of the popular US TV series "Into the West" also 
contributed to the documentary's high viewer ship (according to the 
station, no specific figures available). 
 
¶5. Evaluation: Reporter Ahmet Yesiltepe, despite having served as 
NTV's New York correspondent for several years, found the 
opportunity to travel to the US and report on the experience 
invaluable. He appreciated the access to people at all levels that 
he was able to get with the help of the Department producer. In 
addition, because of his own experience, he was able to capitalize 
on the timing of his visits, broadcasting live on the anniversary of 
the 9/11 attacks and recording interviews on US-Turkey trade 
relations at the annual American-Turkish Council Conference in 
Washington DC in June 2005, for example. 
 
¶6. Co-op Partner: NTV is not only the most watched all-news channel 
in Turkey, but it is also the most respected based on its reputation 
for responsible journalism and quality production. That quality is 
apparent in the segments produced based on material from the TV 
Co-op reporting trips. Its programming reaches a sophisticated 
audience of decision-makers. Our only complaint about NTV during 
this project was that post experienced difficulty in obtaining the 
required production report and copies of the segments. 
 
¶7. Benefits to the Mission: The TV Co-op program contributed to the 
Mission goals in two ways: by encouraging responsible journalism, an 
essential element in the MPP goal of promoting democratic systems; 
and by providing direct access to experts and information for the 
production of accurate and fair TV segments on important MPP issues 
such as US-Turkey trade and defense relations. 
 
¶8. Post would like to especially thank U.S.-based PA/OBS Producer 
Maryam Jazayeri and PA/OBS/BS Producer George Santulli for their 
support with this project. Broadcast quality tapes or DVDs of the 
segments will be sent to George Santulli in the Department.
