APPLICATION 05-1007923 
 
REF: STATE 154528 
 
¶1.  (SBU) In response to reftel questions on application 
05-1007930, Embassy officers verified that Lorena Apunte 
Osorio is an associate of NOPA Importers, a legitimate, 
registered firearms dealer in Quito, Ecuador.  NOPA Importers 
is owned and operated by three sisters; Lorena Apunte Osorio, 
Lucia Del Carmen Apunte Osorio, and Ana Margarita Apunte 
Osorio.  The youngest of the three, Lorena joined the 
operation in 2004 and has no criminal record. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The eldest sister, Ana Margarita, founded NOPA 
Importers in 1999 with the help of a retired military 
officer.  The company primarily imports rifles from the U.S. 
and handguns from Brazil.  The firearms are sold to private 
security firms and to individuals for sporting events.  Ana 
Margarita and Lorena confirmed to PolOff that NOPA strictly 
complies with USG and GOE restrictions on re-exportation of 
firearms. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) NOPA Importers is located on the fifth floor of a 
high rise building with 24 hour security.  The office is 
equipped with an outer metal gate, alarm system, and a video 
entrance system.  Arms are stored behind a locked metal door, 
and in a second secured location on the 15th floor of the 
building. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Ana Margarita Apunte told PolOff M.G. Suber and 
Associates is the local representative for Mossberg and 
Maverick from which NAPO purchases rifles and other arms 
related products.  Based on the information provided, we 
believe NOPA Importers, for which Lorena Apunte Osorio is an 
associate, would be a reliable recipient USML items.
