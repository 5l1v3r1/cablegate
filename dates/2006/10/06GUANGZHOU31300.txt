accordingly. 
 
¶1. (U) Premier Wen Jiabao - with Vice Premier Wu Yi and Minister of 
Commerce Bo Xilai in attendance - announced at the October 15 
opening ceremony of the 100th session of the Canton Export 
Commodities Fair that the Fair will be renamed the Canton Import and 
Export Commodities Fair.  Premier Wen commented that the name change 
signals the desire of China to achieve a basic balance between 
imports and exports. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Premier offered no details on how the name change would 
concretely affect the Fair.  It could well be just an attempt to 
shed China's image as an export-oriented economy and thus a measure 
to deflect criticism of its perennial trade surpluses.  However, if 
representatives of foreign import companies are permitted to 
participate in the upcoming April Commodities Fair, it would signal 
a significant shift in the character of the Fair, and reinforce the 
Government's efforts to promote domestic consumption and adjust its 
trade imbalance - all of which would be good for U.S. business and 
for China's following through on its commitment to enhance market 
access.  In his speech, Premier Wen also highlighted the need for 
IPR protection, observance of WTO rules, and the need to refine 
foreign-related economic laws and regulations.
