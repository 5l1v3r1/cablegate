---------- 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On June 27 an Iraqi judge issued 52 arrest warrants for 
people implicated in the abuses at the former Ministry of Interior 
detention facility known as Site 4. Bolani has so far not authorized 
execution of the warrants.  Paragraph 136 of the Iraqi Criminal 
Procedure Code states that an employee of a ministry can be brought 
to trial for an offense committed during the performance of an 
official duty only with permission of the responsible minister.

DCM ASKS ABOUT SITE 4 INVESTIGATION 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The DCM, accompanied by the Embassy Legal Adviser and Rule 
of Law coordinator, met with Minister of Interior Jawad Bolani on 
October 10.  The DCM expressed the intent in Washington to see the 
GOI take actions following the abuses that had occurred at Site 4, 
and the importance of this in the context of the Leahy Law. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The DCM also noted that in a meeting with the Ambassador, 
Bolani had promised to announce the results of his investigation 
into Site 4 on October 12.  The DCM asked Bolani if he could tell us 
what he planned to say. 
 
------------------------------------- 
BOLANI SAYS INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Bolani replied he had formed three committees to 
investigate the allegations against the people for whom arrest 
warrants had been issued, and that: 
 
-- The three committees had completed their work earlier in the day, 
but he had not yet been briefed on their findings; 
 
-- He would announce the results of the investigation when he met 
with Council of Representatives (COR) members on October 12. 
 
-- He would inform us of what he planned to tell the COR 
representatives before meeting with them. 
 
------------------------- 
BOLANI KEEPS OPTIONS OPEN 
------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Asked what actions he planned to take, Bolani seemed to be 
keep his options open.  He noted that he could authorize the 
execution of arrest warrants, or take administrative action such as 
transferring people to another job, forcing them to retire or firing 
them.  Bolani specified that administrative action would not 
preclude authorizing the execution of arrest warrants. 
 
 
-------------------------------------- 
BOLANI DESCRIBES EFFORTS TO REFORM MOI 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Bolani also noted that he was determined to deal not only 
with Site 4 but to fight all corruption and criminality in the MOI. 
He said that he is the first Minister of Interior to complete a plan 
to reform the MOI.  He added that he had reassigned "thousands" of 
people for improper behavior, and that in the last ten days alone, 
he had sent 40 people to court for prosecution. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Bolani also complained that neither the media nor the U.S. 
Congress are aware of the progress he is making in reforming the 
MOI.  The DCM replied that we would be happy to work with the 
Minister to help ensure that Congress and the media are well 
informed, and asked for additional information to be able to assist 
in this effort.
