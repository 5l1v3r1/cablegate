REQUEST 
 
REF: JAKARTA 12544 (PROSECUTORS DELIVER SENTENCING 
 
     REQUEST) 
 
¶1.  (SBU) In an October 31 session lasting less than an hour, 
the defendants charged in the 2002 murders of two Amcits near 
Timika, Papua refused to respond to the sentencing requests 
handed down by prosecutors on October 13 (reftel).  Their 
attorney, Johnson Penjaitan, attended the trial as a 
spectator and did not speak on their behalf.  Normally, the 
defense should have delivered its closing arguments at this 
stage.  Refusing to take his place at the defense table, 
defendant Anthonious Wamang repeated his complaints to the 
judge about security in the detention facility and medical 
treatment for co-defendant Hardi Sugimol.  Prosecutors 
responded that they would address the security concerns and 
seek treatment for Sugimol in the police hospital.  Wamang 
refused the latter proposal, saying that Sugimol must be 
released to his family in Papua for treatment using 
traditional methods.  Wamang said that he and the other 
defendants would refuse to cooperate with the court until his 
demands were met. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The judge then adjourned the case until Tuesday, 
November 7.  She said that given the defendants' refusal to 
cooperate, she would hand down the verdict at that time. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) About 60 Papuan protestors packed the courtroom and 
attempted to disrupt the proceedings by yelling slogans 
against the U.S., the PT Freeport Indonesia mining company, 
and the Indonesian justice system.  At one point the police 
were on the verge of arresting three ringleaders, but then 
backed down, apparently fearing that this would provoke the 
crowd into outright violence. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Comment: The defendants and their attorneys have 
systematically refused to cooperate throughout the trial, 
presumably in an attempt to build a later claim that they 
were treated unfairly.  The judge has shown consistent 
patience with their obstructionist tactics and has given them 
every opportunity to present their case.  End Comment
