¶1. "Reminiscent of Vietnam" 
 
Liberal, largest national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo 
(10/21) editorialized: "When the US invaded Iraq in March 2003, some 
analysts dared to compare the action to the US's disastrous 
intervention in Vietnam.  They were immediately called 
irresponsible, and their reasoning was discredited.  Today, 
President George W. Bush himself admits a parallel between the two 
wars. For Bush, the recent intensification of Iraqi insurgents' 
actions is aimed at opposing the US public opinion to the war, as 
the communists successfully did almost 40 years ago.  It is not only 
an increasing portion of the US population that is questioning the 
war, but also the generals.... The new diagnosis has emerged 
following a 22% increase in the attacks since the beginning of the 
Islamic month of Ramadan three weeks ago.... The sensation that Bush 
involved the US in a terrible quagmire when he launched the attack 
against Saddam Hussein is spreading. The situation in Iraq has only 
worsened ever since. And now the US cannot use the same strategy it 
used to withdraw from Vietnam, of proclaiming victory and leaving. A 
possible US disengagement in Iraq would lead that nation to 
disintegrate, with global and regional geopolitical repercussions, 
all of them contrary to US interests." 
 
¶2. "Chvez and the UN" 
 
The lead editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (10/23) 
commented: "The impasse in the choice of the new Latin American 
representative in the UN Security Council has shown that President 
Hugo Chvez's influence reached its climax and is now declining.... 
Guatemala accepts a compromise solution [of giving up the candidacy 
in favor of a third nation], But Chvez doesn't. He wants to enjoy a 
UN position from which he can inflict the greatest harm possible to 
the US. And if it is not possible, he wants the US to humiliate 
itself publicly. To withdraw Venezuela's candidacy, he demanded from 
President Bush a declaration freeing the nations to vote as they 
wish. Obviously, the US ignored such a proposal because it would 
disrespect the more than one hundred nations that have voted for 
Guatemala.... It is not only the nations of Europe, Africa and Asia 
that have refused to support a government that plans to use a 
position at the Security Council to systematically oppose 
Washington. Latin American and Caribbean nations have also felt 
discomfort with Chvez's posture.... The Lula administration's 
diplomacy, which has been unusually lenient vis-`-vis Chvez's 
authoritarian methods, has kept quiet.... The current GOB's 
diplomacy doesn't see that Chavez's radical opposition to Bush 
cannot and should not interfere in the permanent and harmonious 
relationship Brazil must have with the US.... The Latin American 
representative at the Security Council must foster cohesion and 
defend the region's common interests and positions. In other words, 
it cannot be Chvez's Venezuela."
