¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  The first class of Afghan National Auxiliary 
Police (ANAP) graduated in Zabul province October 8 and have 
deployed along Highway 1.  The course was taught both in the 
classroom and in the field, and substantial skills improvement was 
seen throughout the ten days of training.  Factors, properly 
handled, that will contribute to the program's success include 
prompt salary payment, proper screening, sufficient support from the 
Ministry of Interior, recruiting from the local population and 
ensuring that the ANAP program does not drain the current ranks of 
other Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF).  End summary. 
 
------------------------- 
A Successful First Course 
------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) The inaugural class of auxiliary police in Afghanistan 
graduated October 8 in Zabul province.  The class consisted of 42 
men who completed a ten-day course taught by two INL police advisors 
and several DynCorp mentors with the assistance of PRT security 
forces personnel.  They were given DynCorp-made temporary ID cards. 
DynCorp distributed some boots, Kevlar vests, holsters and 
flashlights to the graduates.  The class has deployed to checkpoints 
along Highway 1.  The 42 ANAP patrolmen are expected to complete one 
week of additional training each quarter over the next year. 
 
¶3. (U) Classroom training took place at the Afghan National Police 
compound and practical training took place on the PRT compound.  The 
syllabus included training in human rights, the Afghan constitution, 
ethics, traffic control points, squad movement and weapons.  This 
initial group of graduates represents the first step forward in a 
very important process. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Prompt Vetting And Payment A Must 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (U) The primary reason most of these men volunteered for this 
program was the promise of a regular salary.  Word will spread as to 
whether these men are paid on schedule, and that message will be key 
to further recruitment in the program, both in Zabul and surrounding 
provinces. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The screening process is being handled by the Ministry of 
Interior (MOI) and is initiated by written attestations of a 
recruit's good character by village elders and clerics.  Recruits' 
names are to be checked by MOI in Kabul and approved for training. 
Effective screening will be crucial to preventing Taliban 
infiltration of the ANAP and secure training facilities. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Ministry of Interior Support Vital 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶6. (U) Course trainers, in consultation with INL and CSTC-A, are 
teaching from a draft curriculum.  CSTC-A is providing uniforms and 
equipment and has sufficient supplies on hand for 4,000 auxiliary 
patrolmen.  The ministry should also be prepared to modify the 
training curriculum as needed and dedicate trainers to sustain the 
program.  MOI identification cards were not provided to the 
inaugural class and this may inhibit their ability to get paid under 
the new electronic funds transfer system.  Comment:  The Embassy's 
INL office is exploring a possible modification of its current 
DynCorp police ID card contract that would allow issuance of cards 
to auxiliary police.  End Comment 
 
¶7. (U) The next class of approximately 98 recruits is already 
undergoing training.  MOI trainers are expected to begin shouldering 
more of the training burden for this class.

Involve The Community And Don't Deplete The Ranks

¶8. (SBU) The people of Zabul continue to reaffirm their need for 
auxiliary police - but what they really want is for the police in 
their village and district to consist of locals, not outsiders.  In 
 
KABUL 00005284  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
the first class, the mentors estimated that eighty percent of the 
students came from Kandahar.  The biographical data from the second 
class indicates that again, the majority of the potential police 
come from Kandahar, with only sixteen from Zabul province.  Though 
it is vital to train auxiliary police in Zabul, bringing in 
outsiders makes acceptance by the local population an issue. 
 
¶9. (U) The promise of training and reliable pay might be attracting 
regular ANSF officers that are leaving their current positions to 
join the auxiliary police.  In the first class, there was at least 
one trainee that quit his job with the Afghan Highway Police to join 
the class because he believed it would be more beneficial.  The 
point of this program is to augment the existing police structures, 
not poach from them.  However, the allure of training and pay will 
likely continue to draw volunteers from the ranks of the untrained 
and lower paid existing ANSF.  Comment: MOI Screening is intended to 
deter previously trained police officers from jumping from another 
service into the auxiliary police. End Comment 
 
¶10. (SBU) Comment:  Combined Security Transition Command- 
Afghanistan (CSTC-A) is working hard to insure that ANAP patrolmen 
are paid promptly and reliably.  CSTC-A is working in concert with 
the international community, Ministry of Interior and Government of 
Afghanistan to ensure that this new force is paid properly and 
promptly.  Recently President Karzai signed the extended Tashkiel 
which will facilitate payment of these policemen from LOTFA.  The 
Ministry of Interior is responsible for MOI recruiting auxiliary 
police.  Reporting from UNAMA supports PRT view that the ANAP so far 
recruited are drawn heavily from non-locals and have little 
geographic or tribal balance.  The Ambassador has asked UNAMA to 
help build solutions to these complicated problems.  CSTC-A is 
radiating parallel instructions.  The Ambassador has and will 
continue to emphasize to Minister Zarar the importance of recruiting 
auxiliary police who are representative of the local communities to 
which they will be deployed.  We all expected these complicated 
problems to arise.  They have.  We will continue to push for 
solutions.  End Comment
