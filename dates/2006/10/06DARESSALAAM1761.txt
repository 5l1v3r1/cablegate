SUBJECT: TANZANIA LIKELY WILL SUPPORT UNGA RESOLUTIONS ON 
HUMAN RIGHTS IN LEBANON UNDER NAM FRAMEWORK 
 
REF: STATE 176793 
 
¶1.  (U) On October 30, Suleman Saleh, Assistant Director of 
Multilateral Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told 
Poloff that while Tanzania may have reservations about the UN 
General Assembly resolutions sponsored by the Non-Aligned 
Movement (NAM), Tanzania would likely support the resolutions 
under the NAM framework.  Saleh emphasized, however, the 
Tanzanian Government's view that the United Nations needed to 
focus on the root cause of the conflict between Israel and 
Hizballah instead of the conflict's aftermath. 
 
¶2.  (U) In one-on-one, bilateral discussions, Saleh said that 
Tanzania was far more able to express its individual 
reservations and views about the complicated topic.  He did, 
however, express what he believed was the main purpose of the 
NAM resolutions: to highlight what NAM believed to be a 
"disproportionate reaction by Israel to Hizballah's 
instigation" and "the disproportionate impact of Israeli 
bombs on Lebanese civilians." 
 
¶3.  (U) Poloff emphasized the findings of the Human Rights 
Watch and the UN Human Rights Commission about the suffering 
of Israeli children and Hizballah's deliberate concealment of 
weapons within civilian territories.  Saleh agreed that it 
was important to present a balanced view of the suffering on 
both sides, especially with the goal of preventing further 
polarization.  He also emphasized that Tanzania was ready and 
willing to listen to the reservations of its friends such as 
the United States and Israel.
