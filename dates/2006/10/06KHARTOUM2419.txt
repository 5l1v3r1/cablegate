¶1. (SBU) EC President Jose Manuel Barroso departed Sudan on the 
evening of October 1 after two days of visits in Khartoum and El 
Fasher.  Barroso met with President Bashir for two hours on 
September 30, including a half hour one-on-one session; however, EC 
contacts reported Bashir did not budge on his rejection of UNSCR 
1706 and a UN PKO.  Barroso reiterated the international community's 
commitment to UNSCR 1706, but also encouraged Bashir to show some 
flexibility and consider a possible third way.  In comments to the 
press which were confirmed to Poloff through EC counterparts on 
October 2, though Bashir appeared intransigent on the issue of UN 
intervention, he agreed with Barroso that the current situation in 
Darfur is deteriorating and a continuation of the status quo is not 
tenable.  Bashir also expressed concern at Sudan's increasing 
isolation, though he did not offer any new solutions. 
 
¶2. (U) Following the Khartoum visit, Barroso traveled to El Fasher, 
where he met with AU Force Commander Aprezi, the Wali of North 
Darfur, and AU Deputy Head of Mission Gibril.  Barroso was 
accompanied by European Commissioner for Development and 
Humanitarian Aid Luis Michel.  According to EC contacts, the visit 
largely was intended to be symbolic to demonstrate continued 
international concern with the deteriorating situation in Darfur. 
Barroso used the occasion to announce 40 million euros of new 
humanitarian aid.  Barroso further pledged an additional 40 million 
euros of Dutch aid for reconstruction projects.  These 
reconstruction funds were to have been announced at the October 
pledging conference, which has been postponed.  The pledge was made 
contingent on the security situation permitting the projects to move 
forward. 
 
¶3. (SBU) From Sudan, Barroso traveled to Addis Ababa for meetings at 
the AU.  Barroso indicated he would speak to Konare about finding a 
third way through an AU-UN force mix.  His impression was Bashir 
ultimately would be amenable to this, but believed high-level 
discussion between the AU, U.S., UK, and other European partners was 
necessary to reach a consensus position.
