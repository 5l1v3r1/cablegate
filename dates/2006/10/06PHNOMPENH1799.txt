¶1.  (C)  Summary.  The Cambodia government recently informed 
the Embassy that it would support Guatemala in the October 16 
election for the GRULAC rotational seat on the UNSC.  The 
Japanese Ambassador raised the issue with PM Hun Sen during 
an unrelated September 29 meeting.  The RGC had hoped for a 
vote trade with Guatemala and the United States, but has 
opted to support Guatemala with or without any vote trade. 
End Summary. 
 
Cambodia to Support Guatemala 
----------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (C)  On September 27, the Ambassador, DCM, and Pol/Econ 
Chief met with PM advisor Om Yentieng to discuss Cambodia's 
position on the upcoming UNSC vote scheduled for October 16. 
The Ambassador stressed the importance of the issue to the 
USG and noted Venezuela's disruptive behavior in 
international gatherings, including the recent UNGA meetings. 
 The USG was aware that Cambodia had been leaning towards 
Venezuela last year, but the Ambassador hoped that 
discussions between the RGC and the Embassy over the past 
months had convinced Cambodia to support Guatemala.  Om 
Yentieng took careful notes and promised to provide a 
response to the Ambassador before the latter's departure for 
the United States on October 1. 
 
¶3.  (C)  In the meantime, we also approached the Japanese 
Ambassador, who had an unrelated meeting with the PM on 
Friday, September 29, and asked that he also raise the issue 
with Hun Sen.  Ambassador Takahashi told us afterwards that 
the PM had indicated a willingness to support Guatemala, but 
was hoping for a vote trade -- as Venezuela had offered.  On 
September 30, Om Yentieng contacted the Ambassador to clarify 
that the PM had signaled his intention to support Guatemala, 
irrespective of any quid pro quo.  The RGC, he noted, had 
delayed announcing for either country in the hopes of gaining 
vote trade agreements from both Guatemala and the United 
States.  (Note:  We have told the Cambodian government on 
several occasions that we don't engage in vote trades.  End 
Note.)   The PM decided, however, that the RGC would support 
Guatemala even if there is no vote trade, and wanted to pass 
that message to the Ambassador before his departure for the 
United States. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶4.  (C)  The RGC's decision to support Guatemala is welcome 
news, and we have informally expressed our gratitude to the 
government for their support.  The PM's responsiveness to the 
Ambassador's request is another indication of Hun Sen's 
willingness to accept USG counsel -- even when others (e.g., 
his Foreign Ministry) in his government were inclined to 
support Venezuela.  If appropriate, we suggest that the US 
Mission in New York brief their Guatemalan counterparts and 
alert them to Cambodia's desire for a vote trade.  We believe 
that if such a vote trade could be arranged, it would be 
useful insurance in maintaining RGC support through multiple 
voting rounds.  End Comment.
