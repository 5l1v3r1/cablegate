¶1.  (SBU)  On September 30, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party 
(DPP) held a march and a rally in Kaohsiung City to celebrate the 
party's twentieth anniversary.  Although the parade route was 
shortened to one kilometer from the original plan of holding the 
parade throughout Kaohsiung City kilometers (reftel), it was the 
activity that drew the largest crowds.  Buses began arriving in 
Kaohsiung from Ilan, Taitung, Pingtung and other points around the 
island at mid-afternoon. Kaohsiung police announced 105,000 people 
participated in the parade, though an AIT/K observer estimated the 
number as high as 200,000 and event organizers claimed 350,000. 
Almost 90% of participants appeared to AIT/K to be senior citizens 
who had been bused in to the site.  Only two isolated instances of 
an anti-Chen nature perpetrated by lone individuals were televised 
during the more than three hours of live press coverage of the 
anniversary activities. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Following the short, but lively, march, buses began 
loading and departing Kaohsiung about six p.m., more than a full 
hour before the speech by President Chen Shui-bian.  By the time the 
president took the stage to speak, the crowds had dwindled 
significantly to an estimated 20,000 (gauged by AIT/K staff).  Even 
a few Kaohsiung DPP city council members departed the site prior to 
the President's speech.  One later told AIT/K that she had to attend 
Moon Festival activities in her district. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) President Chen's speech held no surprises, but reiterated 
his earlier stated pledges to work toward a new constitution that 
"corresponds to the current situation," to join the United Nations 
under the name of "Taiwan," and to hold a referendum calling for 
recovery of the KMT's "stolen assets."  He also expressed his strong 
hope that the DPP would win the December 2006 Kaohsiung and Taipei 
mayoral elections, elect fifty legislators (out of 113) in the 
December 2007 legislative elections, and win the presidential 
election in March 2008.  AIT/K staff heard rally attendees express 
surprise that, although all top DPP leaders, including Premier Su 
Tseng-chang, Chairman Yu Shy-kun, and Taipei mayoral candidate Frank 
 
SIPDIS 
Hsieh spoke at the rally, Vice-President Annette Lu offered no 
comments at the event.  Almost all speeches were given exclusively 
in Taiwanese, except for a few slogans rendered in Mandarin.  Of the 
top leaders who spoke, only Chairman Yu mentioned the need to 
support the current DPP administration.  Others never even alluded 
to the presidential office or its incumbent. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  As reported in the October 1 Taipei Times (English 
edition), Kaohsiung police said more than 2,700 police were 
stationed along the parade route and at the rally and that 200 
barbed-wire barricades were erected.  An AIT/K staff member learned 
from police at the events, that Tainan police had joined with 
Kaohsiung city and county police to cover the event.  In addition, 
some police from Taichung (central Taiwan) were also present to lend 
assistance.
