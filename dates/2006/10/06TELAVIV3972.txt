REF: STATE 169418 
 
¶1.  Post provided reftel points to the MFA Deputy Director 
General for the United Nations and International 
Organizations, Aharon Leshno Yaar, on October 10.  Although 
most MFA staff are on holiday this week, Yaar agreed to share 
our points with MFA Deputy Director General Miriam Ziv, who 
heads the Strategic Affairs Division that is most concerned 
with the DPRK issue. 
 
¶2.  Press reports indicate that Prime Minister Olmert will 
hold a special meeting on dealing with the threat posed by 
the Iranian nuclear program -- a meeting that has been moved 
up to this week in light of the North Korean nuclear test and 
its implications for the Middle East.  On October 10, 
Minister of Public Security Avi Dichter told Israel Radio: 
"Israel is very troubled by what Iran is doing and you could 
say that North Korea comes after that.  Israel should not be 
the country that handles this.  But the combination of 
Iranian wishes, intentions and capabilities coupled with 
North Korean means is a very bad combination, very bad for 
Israel, and very bad for the Middle East." 
 
¶3. On October 9, the Israeli MFA Spokesman communicated the 
following statement: (Begin text) 
 
Israel joins others in the international community in 
condemning North Korea's nuclear test.  The test is an 
irresponsible and provocative act that could pose a serious 
threat to the regional stability of northeast Asia and to 
global and international security. 
 
Israel reiterates its call to continue the moratorium on 
nuclear tests and expects North Korea to stop any action that 
would worsen the situation.  Israel also calls on the 
international community to firmly implement UNSC resolutions 
adopted to deal with WMD and the proliferation threat.
