CONFLICT 
 
REF: A. STATE 178061 B. STATE 176793 
 
On October 25, Embassy delivered Ref. A and B demarches to 
Foreign Ministry Assistant Minister for Multilateral Affairs 
Hadzimusic.  Hadzimusic noted that Bosnia was no longer a 
member of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), and currently held 
observer status.  He said that as an affiliate member of the 
Organization of Islamic Communities (OIC), a NAM observer, 
and an EU aspirant, Bosnia sometimes felt squeezed between 
their conflicting policies.  He acknowledged that maintaining 
a balanced approach to the Israel-Lebanon conflict was 
important for the UN's credibility as a neutral mediator, and 
said Bosnia would likely abstain from voting in favor of 
extending the mandate of the three UN institutions mentioned 
in Ref. A, as well as on the NAM-sponsored resolution in Ref. 
Â¶B.
