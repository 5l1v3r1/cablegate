¶1.  (C) Summary: Ecuadorian military officials on October 19 
confirmed that two Ecuadorian civilians were killed by 
Colombian military gunfire on October 15 while traveling in a 
canoe with FARC rebels on the San Miguel River.  Foreign 
Minister Francisco Carrion publicly criticized the Colombian 
military and called for reparations for the victims' 
families.  The bi-national commission met on October 19 to 
evaluate the incident, and is expected to release a detailed 
report later this week.  End summary. 

Ecuadorians Killed; Details Murky 
--------------------------------- 

¶2.  (U) According to press reports, two Ecuadorian nationals 
resident in Colombia were shot and killed on October 15 while 
traveling in canoe on the Ecuadorian side of the San Miguel 
River in the Sucumbios province.  The canoe reportedly came 
under Colombian military gunfire around 7:30 a.m., killing a 
52 year-old woman and 31 year-old man.

¶3.  (C) The Ecuadorian 24th Special Forces Battalion 
Commander based in LagoAgrio, Sucumbios, Luis Lara, 
confirmed the incident to Embassy officials.  Lara admitted 
that details surrounding the event remain murky, but said 
that the Ecuadorian military believes that FARC rebels were 
also traveling in the canoe with the Ecuadorian civilians 
killed (Note: Canoes often serve as river taxis on the San 
Miguel).  The Colombian military, apparently unaware of the 
civilian travelers, fired on the canoe from the Colombian 
side of the border, Lara explained.  He was not certain if 
the FARC rebels were also killed, but signaled that it was 
likely. 

FM Carrion Demands Reparations 
------------------------------ 

¶4.  (U) Foreign Minister Francisco Carrion in a press 
conference on October 18 said that the bi-national border 
commission (COMBIFRON) would meet in emergency session on 
October 19 on the San Miguel Bridge between Sucumbios, 
Ecuador and Putumayo, Colombia to exchange information.
Carrion also called for the Colombian government to punish 
those responsible and compensate the victims' families. 
Defense Minister Marcelo Delgado, who traveled to the region 
earlier in the week, told the press that further 
investigation was needed, but that the GOE believed that the 
Colombian military fired the shots that killed the two 
civilians. 

Comment 
------- 

¶5.  (C) The area of the incident is known FARC territory and 
is a hotbed of illegal activity and conflict between the 
Colombian military and FARC rebels.  A more definitive report 
on the scuffle is expected later this week.  Bilateral 
consultation procedures on border incidents have resolved 
similar cases in the recent past, with hiccups, and the cases 
generally fade from public view once the GOC agrees to pay 
damages (even when not explicitly accepting responsibility 
for the incident).  We will encourage the GOE to handle this 
incident in a similar manner.
