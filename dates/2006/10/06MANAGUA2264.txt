(C) Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Norman Caldera told 
Ambassador and poloff on October 10 that he shares USG's 
concern about North Korea's nuclear testing (reftels). 
Caldera explained that he is urging the Central American 
Organization for Cooperation (SICA) to adopt the European 
Union's similar position as a basis for a public declaration. 
 Further, Caldera will share President Bush's October 9 
statement on North Korea's nuclear test with SICA.  Caldera 
indicated that the Nicaraguan government will release a 
public statement on Wednesday, Oct 11 in line with the USG 
position if SICA does not act.  He will also look at the 
possibility of adopting financial sanctions on the DPNK.
