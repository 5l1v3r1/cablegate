¶6.      OZGUR GUNDEM:   The daily claims that PKK's cease-fire 
process had its repercussions in the political sphere.   While 
AKP seems to be in a tendency to seize the opportunity the 
process may serve, DYP leader, who launched a tour in the 
southeastern region to meet with non-governmental organizations, 
brought the issue of declaring a general amnesty to the agenda. 
Agar made a call to the government, and told that he was ready

Adana Arts Council sent a letter of warning to the French 
Ambassador in Ankara about the law envisaged.  Chamber of 
Industry in Gaziantep also called for a boycott on French goods 
should the law takes effect.  Meanwhile, Evrensel daily, equally 
blames Armenians in France and the Turkish authorities, for the 
political uproar on genocide claims, and characterized the 
latest developments in Turkey as "schizophrenic internal strife 
to achieve political ends".

Motherland Party, told the journalists during the opening 
ceremony of the new party building in Adana's Yuregir district

Armenian issue and terror issues.
