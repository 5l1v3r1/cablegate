¶3. On October 5, 2006, Export Control Attache Donald 
Pearce and FSN Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested pre-license check at the offices of Moscow 
Institute of Radio-Technique, Electronics and 
Automation (MIREA), 78 Prospect Vernadskogo, D-415, 
Moscow, Russia. The export control team met with 
Sergey Filatov, Deputy rector, Head of International 
Relations, Alexander Zaitsev, Deputy Director of 
Educational-Scientific Association "Electronics," Ivan 
Vasilyevsky, Senior Researcher and Anton Lisitsky, 
Senior Researcher. 
 
¶4. MIREA was founded in 1968 to prepare specialists in 
the radio electronics field.  The Institute has 16,000 
students in 11 faculties and over 100 departments. 
The staff consists of 16 full members, 300 higher 
doctoral degree holders, and 1000 PhD-level 
instructors.  The Department for Study of Physical- 
Electrical Properties in Nanostructures was founded 
two years ago to focus on research and education 
relating to semiconductors and nanotechnology. 
 
¶5. The commodities in reftel will be utilized by the 
Department to study the behavior of nanostructures. 
Projects relating to the speed of electron flow in 
short lengths and ballistic electron flight.  Data 
collected will also be analyzed in the mathematical 
and theoretical departments, and shared with the 
Zelenograd based Nanotechnology Center of the Moscow 
Institute of Electronic Techniques.  Mr. Vasilyevsky 
and Mr. Lisitsky will be the principal researchers 
utilizing the equipment.  Access will be limited to 5- 
10 students or less depending on the needs of the 
research. 
 
¶6. The devices will be stored in a limited access area 
of the laboratory.  The laboratory is secured with 
cipher locks and an electronic alarm system, and all 
exterior windows are barred.  As the laboratory 
contains very expensive equipment, the area is given a 
priority for security patrols and is limited to access 
by authorized students and faculty only.  The 
Department has no weapons of mass destruction or 
missile technology research programs. 
 
¶7. Recommendations: Post recommends Moscow Institute 
of Radio-Technique, Electronics and Automation 
(MIREA), Moscow, Russia, as reliable recipients of 
sensitive U.S. origin commodities. It is requested 
that post be notified of final disposition of the 
application, and of any shipments for this 
 
 
organization in order to conduct appropriate FCS 
follow-up and statistical reporting.
