¶1.  (SBU) Since the entry-into-force of the U.S.-Morocco Free 
Trade Agreement on January 1, 2006, the U.S. Mission in 
Morocco has made monitoring of Moroccan compliance with the 
agreement a top priority.  We carry out this responsibility 
through an interagency team, chaired by the Embassy Economic 
Counselor, and including all economic agencies at both the 
Embassy in Rabat and the Consulate General in Casablanca.  We 
also work closely with the U.S. private sector through the 
American Chamber of Commerce in Casablanca, to learn its 
concerns and exchange information about compliance issues. 
The following information is keyed to the action request in 
para 11 of reftel: 
 
¶A. Mission Organization: The interagency Trade Agreement 
Monitoring and Compliance Team at Embassy Rabat is chaired by 
the Economic Counselor and includes representatives from FCS 
(Commercial Counselor Rick Ortiz, who is based at the 
Consulate in Casablanca), FAS (Embassy Agricultural Attache 
Michael Fay), USAID (Economic Growth Team Leader James May) 
and the Economic Section (both the counselor and Trade 
Officer Jim Jimenez).  It meets on a monthly basis to review 
developments relating to the FTA, and briefs Mission 
leadership on emerging issues, both to solicit their guidance 
and to enlist them in lobbying the GOM. 
 
¶B. Contact person: Economic Counselor Stuart Smith; 
 212-37-76-22-65, x2132; fax  212-37-76-39-84; e-mail 
smithsm2@state.gov. 
 
¶C. Complaint Response Activities: Mission's interagency team 
is currently working with American businesses regarding what 
we perceive to be excessive Moroccan restrictions on 
transhipment of American goods through third ports in Europe. 
 After extensive contacts with industry and intial 
conversations with GOM officials, we are in the process of 
scheduling a direct video-conference between U.S. and 
Moroccan customs officials, to permit U.S. and Moroccan trade 
and customs officials to discuss the issue directly.  We are 
also engaged in discussions about bilateral differences 
regarding allocation of quotas for grain imports under the 
agreement. 
 
Similarly, when the Moroccans raise questions or concerns 
about U.S. implementation of the agreement, we relay those 
inquiries to Washington agencies. 
 
¶D. Proactive Monitoring:  Members of mission's interagency 
team meet regularly with American businesses, including a 
monthly session with the Free Trade Committee of the American 
Chamber of Commerce in Casablanca.  When we receive specific 
complaints, as regarding transhipment, we follow up 
agressively, lobbying Moroccan agencies on the company's 
behalf, and when that is unsuccessful, pressing for direct 
exchanges between U.S. and Moroccan experts to resolve the 
difference in interpretation of the agreement.
