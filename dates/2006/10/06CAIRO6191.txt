¶1. (SBU) Egyptian representatives from AMC Airlines, one of 
the country's largest and longest running private airlines, 
were taken into secondary questioning at JFK International 
Airport for more than 12 hours while en route to Seattle in 
late August. Company representatives, including the 
chairman's son, who is also a pilot for the Cairo-based 
company, claim that while in secondary questioning they were 
mistreated and subjected to body searches. All were 
eventually admitted, but missed connecting flights to 
Seattle, where they were arranging delivery of a new Boeing 
aircraft to add to their fleet. 
 
¶2. (SBU) After the incident, a Boeing representative 
contacted FCS, protesting the incident. He told FCS that AMC 
had informed them that they would reconsider their business 
ties with US-based companies. FCS Counselor met with company 
chairman El Sayed Saber the week of September 25, apologizing 
for the incident and encouraging him to contact FCS before 
future trips to the US so he could try to assure hassle-free 
entry for legitimate business travelers. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Last week, FCS coordinated with post's local Legatt 
office to ensure that an Egypt Air delegation en route to 
Seattle for another Boeing purchase did not face similar 
obstacles.  Legatt attach contacted FBI and DHS 
representatives at the port of entry to alert them about the 
representatives' arrival, and they were admitted without 
incident. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment. AMC's story is likely to circulate among 
the local business community, who increasingly see the US as 
an unwelcoming place to do business. Boeing is concerned 
about the negative impact that incidents of this nature many 
have on their exports to Egypt and the region. Post hopes 
that the arrival of a new DHS visa security unit in Cairo, 
expected in January, will help reduce these kinds of problems 
before travelers board flights to the U.S.
