Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) "The United States is Panama's strategic partner of 
choice on security issues, but Panama needs additional 
resources to strengthen its security infrastructure," 
Minister of Government and Justice Olga Golcher told STAFFDEL 
Meacham and Toon on October 18.  Golcher lauded the bilateral 
relationship while discussing areas for improvement and 
outlined ongoing GOP projects including the planned 
development of a Panamanian Coast Guard, programs to fight 
trafficking in persons, and assistance to refugees.  End 
summary. 
 
------------------------ 
A "Special" Relationship 
------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Golcher emphasized the "special" relationship 
between Panama and the United States, and the U.S. Embassy in 
particular, at the meeting, also attended by MOGJ Secretary 
General Danilo Toro and EMBOFFs.  She said the Torrijos 
Administration had a particularly strong relationship with 
the United States that "couldn't be better," especially in 
cooperation on security, counterterrorism, and 
counternarcotics issues.  Nevertheless, Golcher stated 
several times both Panama's need for funding and resources on 
these issues and the GOP's hope to strengthen the 
relationship further, making an appeal for continued USG 
assistance as a key component of the bilateral relationship. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In response to a question on how Panama's purported 
neutrality would affect the bilateral relationship, however, 
Golcher cautiously replied that the GOP understood the need 
for the Canal to be neutral while also understanding the 
reality of the security environment.  "Respecting neutrality 
does not mean not recognizing threats," Golcher said.  Toro 
quickly added that Panama saw the United States as its first 
choice in strategic partnership. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Toro then outlined three areas to help strengthen 
U.S.-Panamanian cooperation: maintaining the level of 
cooperation without interference from internal politics and 
processes; additional USG assistance on capacity building; 
and improving communications and information flow.  He added 
that access to timely information and compatible technology 
for security systems were essential. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
Progress report- Coast Guard, trafficking, refugees 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Golcher used the GOP's proposed plan to build a 
Coast Guard as an example of Panama's need to invest in 
public forces and the need for resources to make such 
investment happen.  She said the proposed Coast Guard was 
ideal for the country's security needs, adding that the 
current system was antiquated and not suitable for what 
Panama required. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) On trafficking-in-persons, Golcher said the GOP was 
developing procedures and guidelines for the repatriation of 
child victims trafficked into Panama.  She emphasized that 
the number of trafficking victims overall in Panama, as well 
as the number of victims of Panamanian nationality, was very 
small.  Panama was also working with other Central American 
countries, with the help of Spanish and Italian consultants, 
to create a map of major trafficking routes in the region. 
The map would help countries involved in the fight against 
this illicit trafficking to be more vigilant on these routes, 
Golcher said. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) On refugees, Golcher was optimistic that the 
refugee intake system in Panama was working well.  She 
mentioned the summer arrival of a group of displaced 
indigenous fleeing the conflict in Colombia, saying that 
Panama's refugee commission would soon make a decision on 
their final status.  Golcher said the option of third country 
resettlement was important, particularly in the case of 
Cubans who did not really qualify as refugees. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Overall, Golcher and Toro were very interested in 
the staffers' questions and focused on the need to continue 
to improve the strong bilateral relationship.  They were 
receptive to the staffers' emphasis on the bipartisan nature 
of the Senate's work on security issues as well as the need 
for a multinational approach. 
 
¶9.  (U) This cable has been cleared by Carl Meacham and 
Bernard Toon.
