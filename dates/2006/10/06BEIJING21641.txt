¶1.  Key Points made at the October 12 Press Briefing were: 
 
-- The DPRK must not further worsen the Korean peninsula 
nuclear situation. 
 
-- Six-Party Talks remain the best method for resolving the 
crisis, however direct dialogue between the United States and 
DPRK would help narrow differences. 
 
-- China remains firmly opposed to any military action in the 
Korean peninsula. 
 
-- Japanese consideration of a missile defense system, in 
light of the DPRK test, is a matter for Japan. 
 
-- South Korean President Roh Moo Hyun will visit China 
October 13 to meet with President Hu Jintao. 
 
-- China and the United States are discussing a possible 
visit to China by Secretary Rice. 
 
-- The MFA has made no contact with Nepal regarding the 
border shooting of a Tibetan nun two weeks ago. 
 
DPRK Nuclear Test 
----------------- 
 
¶2.  At the October 12 regularly scheduled MFA Press Briefing, 
Spokesperson Liu Jianchao said the DPRK must stop any further 
actions that could further worsen the situation.  Repeating 
the PRC's official position, Liu said China hopes all parties 
act responsibly in "a cool-headed manner" and resume the 
Six-Party Talks. 
 
¶3.  China will continue to consult with other UN Security 
Council members on appropriate action that will help 
establish a denuclearized Korean peninsula, said Liu.  Asked 
by Reuters whether China opposed Chapter 7 sanctions outright 
or just in part, Liu said that all parties of the UNSC have 
proposed solutions to the issue, and all measures, including 
Chapter 7 and the U.S.-draft resolution, were being 
discussed.  China also has a comprehensive resolution for 
consideration.  Liu was unable to comment on any specific 
article of the resolution, but assrted that China remains 
firmly opposed to anymilitary action to resolve the problem 
in the Korean peninsula.  Any measures, including Chapter 7, 
should be studied as to their ability to benefit 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and stability in 
Northeast Asia, he said. 
 
¶4.  Liu reiterated China's support of the Six-Party Talks 
process as being the best, most practical forum for resolving 
the North Korean nuclear situation.  Responding to a UPI 
reporter's question on whether China supported bilateral 
talks between the United States and the DPRK, Liu said direct 
talks would help to narrow their differences but at this 
stage differences were so great that the Talks remain the 
best opportunity to build trust and the best method for 
resolution. 
 
¶5.  Liu sidestepped several question on whether President Hu 
Jintao had spoken directly to Kim Jong-Il after the test and 
at what level China was in contact with the DPRK.  China had 
stayed in contact with other parties, including the other 
members of the UNSC, the EU and Canada.  He had no 
information on whether a special envoy or delegation would be 
sent to the DPRK. 
 
¶6.  China remains dedicated to the development of a "good 
neighbor relationship" with the DPRK, provided that the main 
purpose of economic assistance is to help the DPRK improve 
the livelihoods and conditions of the population, Liu said. 
 
"PUNISH" VS. "PUNITIVE" 
----------------------- 
 
¶7.  A Hong Kong commercial radio reporter asked Liu to 
distinguish between his October 10 statement that 
"punishment" should not be used when discussing measures to 
respond to North Korea and UN Ambassador Wang Guangya's 
comment that measures should be "punitive,"  prompting Liu to 
state that both comments represent the view of the Chinese 
government.  Liu stressed that the point of both comments was 
that all parties should focus on the denuclearization of the 
Korean peninsula, as opposed to how best to punish the DPRK. 
 
JAPAN REACTION AND MISSILE DEFENSE 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶8.  China understands the concerns of all parties in the 
region, but hopes that any actions taken in response to the 
 
BEIJING 00021641  002 OF 002 
 
 
DPRK nuclear test strengthen stability on the peninsula, Liu 
said.  Specifically, Japan's reconsideration of a missile 
defense system was a matter of Japan's internal affairs, he 
said in response to a question by a Japanese reporter. 
 
ROK PRESIDENT ROH TO VISIT TOMORROW 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶9.  South Korean President Roh Moo Hyun will visit China 
October 12 to meet with President Hu Jintao, Wen Jiabao and 
Wu Bangguo.  Liu said discussions would focus on China-ROK 
relations and the current situation on the Korean peninsula. 
 
POSSIBLE SECRETARY RICE VISIT; TANG IN U.S. 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶10.  A reporter asked whether Secretary Rice was going to 
visit China next week.  Liu confirmed the United States and 
China were discussing a possible visit, but there was no 
agreement as yet.  In response to a question by the same 
reporter, Liu said President Hu's Special Envoy Tang Jiaxuan 
is in the United States discussing the latest Korean 
peninsula developments. 
 
CHINA-NEPAL BORDER SHOOTING 
---------------------------- 
 
¶11.  Liu denied knowledge of the alleged shooting by Chinese 
border patrol at Tibetans along the China-Nepal border.  A 
reporter for AP pointed out the incident was over two weeks 
old and that surely by now the MFA had been in contact with 
the Nepalese government, but Liu said that if it had happened 
the appropriate Chinese authority was investigating the 
incident, not the MFA.  A reporter for the Scotsman claimed 
western climbers had witnessed the incident and photographed 
the bodies of two who had been killed.  Liu said he doubted 
the reporter's ensuing assertion that the climbers were then 
contacted by Chinese officials in Kathmandu to discuss the 
incident. 
 
PRESSURE ON VIETNAM TO NOT INVITE TAIWAN TO APEC 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶12.  In response to a Taiwanese newspaper reporter seeking 
comment on whether China pressured Vietnam  not to invite 
Taiwan to APEC, Liu said all parties understood the One China 
principle and China hoped Vietnam would handle invitations to 
APEC accordingly.
