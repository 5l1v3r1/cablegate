SUBJECT: FINLAND: I2010 INFORMATION SOCIETY CONFERENCE 
ATTRACTS TECHNOLOGY EXPERTS AND VISIONARIES 
 
 
¶1. European decision-makers and leading experts convened in 
Espoo, Finland on September 28th to discuss the challenges 
of the information society during the i2010 Conference, 
"Towards a Ubiquitous European Information Society."  The 
Conference examined the opportunities and challenges that 
new information and communications technologies are bringing 
to European citizens, businesses and government leaders, 
with a focus on increasing European competitiveness. 
 
¶2. Ms. Susanna Huovinen, Finland's Minister of Transport and 
Communications, hosted the Conference which featured many 
business and government leaders including Ms. Viviane 
Reding, European Commissioner for Information Society and 
Media, and Jorma Ollila, Chairman of Nokia. 
 
¶3. The presentations focused on "ubiquitous services" that 
will increasingly influence the way in which individuals 
live and work due to having ICT services available at all 
times and in all places delivered through wireless 
connections and the interoperability of data.  The 
Conference highlighted the impacts of new technology on data 
security, e-services and communication networks. 
 
¶4. Several speakers touched on the importance of developing 
a common European standard for mobile TV.  The European 
Commission is planning to publish a mobile TV development 
plan early next year. 
 
¶5. Presenters also called for supporting new technology 
applications for the transportation industry such as "eCall" 
in cars, a technology that can call emergency dispatch 
centers.  Minister Huovinen called on the remaining EU 
member countries to support eCall by allocating part of 
their broadcast frequencies for this emerging technology 
with potential lifesaving benefits. 
 
¶6. Presidency Conclusions were published in connection with 
the Conference, including policy guidelines for the main 
activities involved in the EU's i2010 information society 
strategy.  The final conclusions will be discussed during 
the Council of Telecommunications Ministers in December. 
 
¶7. The Conference was arranged by Finland's Ministry of 
Transport and Communications in cooperation with the 
European Commission and the European Network and Information 
Security Agency, ENISA.  Further information can be found
