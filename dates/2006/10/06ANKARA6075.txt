 ¶1. (SBU) Summary: Turkey provided additional comments on the 
Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GI) Statement 
of Principles and other documents on October 19.  The Turkish 
delegation will fully participate in the Rabat conference, 
but does not plan to present an expert-level briefing on 
October 31.  The head of the Turkish delegation will be 
prepared to invite participants to Turkey for the second GI 
partners conference.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Ahmet Muhtar Gun, MFA Head of Department for OSCE, 
Arms Control, and Disarmament, provided us and Russian First 
Secretary Dmitri Zykov additional GOT comments on the 
 
SIPDIS 
Statement of Principles, Terms of Reference, and Explanatory 
Notes on October 19.  We scanned the Turkish mark-up and 
transmitted it via e-mail to T and ISN/WMD on October 20. 
The new suggestions appear to be non-substantive.  The 
mark-up we received on October 19 includes the MFA's initial 
comments, which were conveyed to the Department on September 
22 and repeated in ref a. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  In the joint presentation we made with Zykov, we 
informed Gun that we hoped to have the final draft documents 
by October 23, and that we would deliver them to him prior to 
the departure of the Turkish delegation.  We shared the draft 
Rabat agenda contained in ref b, provided as much information 
as we could about the U.S. and Russian delegations, and again 
strongly encouraged the Turks to provide at least one 
expert-level briefing for the October 31 session.  Gun, who 
had initially told us that Turkey would not make an expert 
presentation, replied that Turkey's delegation would not 
include a technical expert. He expected the four-member 
delegation to participate actively in all of the conference 
events, and stated that Deputy U/S Akgunay would be prepared 
to invite the partners to hold the second GI meeting in 
Turkey.
