REF: STATE 176793 
 
(SBU) On October 24, poloff delivered reftel points urging 
capitals to vote against two unbalanced, anti-Israel 
resolutions in the Third Committee, to Kim Moon-hahn, 
Director of MOFAT's Human Rights and Social Affairs Division. 
 On October 26, Kim responded that the ROKG had carefully 
read reftel points and fully agreed that the NAM was 
politicizing issues.  The ROKG does not want either 
resolution to pass, but it had not decided whether to vote 
against or abstain.  Kim said that his personal sense was 
that the ROKG would abstain, even if it agreed with the USG 
position, in an effort to remain neutral on divisive Middle 
East issues.
