 ¶1.  (SBU)  Pol/Econ Chief delivered reftel A and B demarches 
to MFA Director for the Department of International 
Organizations Sun Suon on October 11 and October 24, 
respectively.  On the indigenous peoples demarche, there is 
no New Zealand Embassy in Cambodia and the Australian Embassy 
informed us that they were not instructed to raise this issue 
with the RGC.  Sun Suon noted that this issue has been a 
contentious matter for some time, but was not up to date on 
the arguments presented in reftel B.  Pol/Econ Chief provided 
demarche points from reftel A to the MFA official, adding 
that they represented agreed-upon language with the New 
Zealand and Australian governments.  Pol/Econ Chief noted 
that the Cambodian hill tribes might view themselves as 
indigenous people; Sun Suon said that the RGC would not 
recognize any of the country's ethnic minority groups as 
indigenous people and would insist the term cannot be applied 
in Cambodia.  Suon nevertheless promised to pass on our 
points and arguments. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  On the NAM resolutions and Lebanon (reftel B), 
Suon said that Cambodia normally recommends balanced language 
in NAM statements and proposed resolutions, and would do so 
in the case of Lebanon.  He agreed that the NAM resolutions 
are more political than substantive, but added that Cambodia 
usually looks to others in ASEAN for consensus on their 
position.
