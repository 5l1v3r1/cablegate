The talking points and the President's October 9 speech on 
the North Korean nuclear test were delivered to Nasser 
Bourita, Director of United Nations and International 
Organizations, in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on October 
12 (reftel A).  These points followed the October 6 demarche 
delivered on the possibility of the North Korean test (reftel 
B).  Bourita said that the October 13 speech by the Moroccan 
representative in Vienna condemned the test,that it was a 
threat to international security, that the proliferation of 
nuclear weapons is unnecessary, and that the Near East should 
be a "nuclear free zone."
