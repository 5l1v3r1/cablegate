REF: MCC SCORECARD E-MAIL FROM DESK 
 
¶1.  On October 5, DCM and econoff delivered Millennium 
Challenge Corporation (MCC) scorecard talking points to the 
MFA's Director of the Americas Desk, Ambassador Abdellah 
Tazi.  Tazi accentuated the positive after learning how 
Morocco's promotion from MCC's Low Income Country (LIC) 
category to the Lower Middle Income Country (LMIC) category 
impacted the scorecard.  Compared to previous years, 
increased competition within the LMIC category has caused 
Morocco to fall below the median score in the scorecard's 
measurement of Government Effectiveness, although it is 
within the margin of error.  DCM reassured Tazi that MCC's 
work on Morocco's existing Compact proposal would not be 
interrupted by the new scorecard results because it is based 
on the country's eligibility from 2005 and 2006.  The DCM 
emphasized that Morocco's Compact remains a priority for MCC, 
and that due diligence on the Compact proposal is proceeding. 
 The DCM said that on November 8, the MCC Board of Directors 
will meet to discuss Morocco's performance and decide on its 
2007 eligibility. 
 
¶2.  Drawing on guidance provided by MCC's Senior Country 
Director Michael Grossman, the DCM also emphasized the 
following points to Tazi: 
 
    -- Although Morocco scored below the median in the 
Government Effectiveness measurement, it was within the 
margin of error and the MCC Board of Directors will determine 
how to evaluate this result in light of current trends in 
Morocco related to democratic reform. 
 
   -- While post does not know exactly what caused the change 
in Morocco's score, MCC will analyze the result and discuss 
it with the GOM in greater detail in the future.  However, 
the Board of Directors takes democratic governance indicators 
very seriously. 
 
   -- Rating indicators are more competitive for the LMIC 
category than for the LIC category. 
 
   -- It is possible that prior to signing a potential 
Compact Agreement with any candidate country the MCC would 
ask it to provide a corrective action plan for areas where 
the country received a deficient score. 
 
¶3.  Tazi was concerned that Morocco had scored under the 
median on several other measurements and questioned the 
various NGOs whose reports form the basis of the scorecard. 
However, he appreciated that work on the country's existing 
Compact proposal would continue, and said that the GOM was 
determined to make the MCC program in Morocco a success.
