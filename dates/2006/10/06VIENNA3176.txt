REF: STATE 178061 
 
Â¶1.  Acting EconPol Counselor and PolOff delivered reftel 
demarche on October 25 to Peter Huber, the MFA,s Deputy Head 
(DAS-equivalent) of the International Organizations 
Department.  Huber emphasized the importance of maintaining 
Austria's balanced approach within the Middle East.  He added 
that such an approach bolsters Austria's position as an 
honest broker in the region.  He noted that Austria had 
abstained on the three resolutions in the past and, barring 
any significant developments, would also abstain this year. 
According to Huber, an abstention also sent a message that 
the resolutions were unacceptable.
