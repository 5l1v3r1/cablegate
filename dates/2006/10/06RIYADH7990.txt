SUBJECT: IRAQI DELEGATION VISITS KSA TO DISCUSS IRAQ 
BILATERAL DEBT 
 
 
 ¶1.  The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Finance confirmed 
to us on October 9 that an Iraqi technical delegation came to 
Saudi Arabia on October 7 to discuss Iraqi debt to Saudi 
Arabia. 
 
¶2.  According to Deputy Minister of Finance Al-Bazi'y, three 
Iraqi delegates from the Ministry of Finance visited Riyadh. 
Al-Bazi'y characterized the meeting as technically-oriented, 
an attempt to reach agreement on a final figure for Iraqi 
debt before policy-makers begin to negotiate debt reduction 
terms.  Referencing Foreign Minister Prince Saud,s 
statements at a September 18 UN high-level meeting on Iraq, 
Al-Bazi,y said the SAG "has made its position clear, and is 
ready to do something," regarding Iraqi debt.  However, he 
added, the Iraqis "have more homework to do" coming up with 
documents to support their position.  He indicated there has 
not been much progress since a similar delegation from Iraq 
visited Saudi Arabia two years ago. 
 
¶3.  Al-Bazi'y made clear this was the first of several 
meetings which would be needed before this issue could be 
resolved.
