SUBJECT: Ansar al-Islam Trial Update 
 
REF: A) Frankfurt 4401 
 
Sensitive but unclassified; not for internet distribution. 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The trial of three suspected members of Ansar 
al-Islam accused of plotting to assassinate then-Iraqi Prime 
Minister Allawi during a visit to Germany in December 2004 is 
ongoing in Stuttgart-Stammheim (a high-security court facility). 
One defendant has spoken out in recent proceedings, claiming he is 
not a terrorist.  Unwilling to predict the outcome, the lead 
prosecutor told us that several key charges have yet to be discussed 
in court and that the trial will likely last until spring 2007.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
"I Am No Terrorist" 
------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The trial of the three suspected terrorists began on June 
20 (ref A).  During proceedings in September and October, the press 
reported that two of the accused repeated their claim of innocence 
and voiced frustration over the process.  One of the accused, Mazen 
al-Hussein, admitted his knowledge of the plot against Allawi. 
Stating "I am no terrorist" and that he is personally against 
killing, al-Hussein claims he worked to delay the attack during 
telephone conversations with another unnamed plotter.  Al-Hussein 
admits to giving money, however, that was sent to Iraq to another 
accused -- but claims the money was used to support victims of the 
Iraq war, not terrorists.  Hussein also told the court that he is 
not an "Islamist" and that if he had wanted to fight in Iraq, he 
would have never left that country. 
 
¶3. (SBU) As for the alleged ringleader of Ansar al-Islam in Germany 
and accused co-conspirator in the Allawi plot, Ata Abdulaziz Rashid, 
Hussein claims he too opposed the assassination plans.  Another of 
the accused, Rafik Mohamad Yousef, expressed frustration that a 
long-awaited witness for the prosecution did not show up at the 
expected time.  The court reported that the witness, who continues 
to work with German intelligence, was under cover within the Muslim 
community and faced imminent danger if he were to appear in court. 
The court indicated it would resort to a voice-altered 
videoconference to obtain the testimony. 
 
Prosecutor Predicts Lengthy Trial; Key Points Yet to be Discussed 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Court press spokesperson Josefine Koeblitz told us that 
proceedings are scheduled to run through early 2007 and will 
continue as needed beyond that.  Some press reports suggest the 
court anticipates a verdict on January 11, 2007 (the last currently 
scheduled trial date).  However, Senior Public Prosecutor Silke 
Ritzert -- the prosecuting attorney in this case -- told us she 
believes the trial will go on into spring 2007, unless one or more 
defendants makes a confession or admission.  Ritzert also told us 
that some of the key issues such as recruitment of "active 
supporters" and solicitation of funds to support terrorism have not 
yet been discussed during the trial.
