Classified By: CDA Matt Tueller for reasons 1.4(b), (d), and (g)

¶1. (U) This message, cleared by embassies Kuwait, Riyadh,
Amman, Damascus, Baghdad, and Ankara, provides
recommendations for regional activities to advance the
counterterrorism strategy developed in March in Kuwait.
While not exhaustive, the initiatives described below are in
posts' opinion relatively easy to launch if funding is
available. Posts recommend S/CT identify available funding
sources and that the Iraq and Neighbors Conference
participants convene a video-conference in mid-October to
discuss scheduling and other initiatives.

¶2. (S REL AUS UK) The Israeli-Lebanese conflict and
resulting protests, complete with pro-Hizballah banners,
witnessed in Kuwait and elsewhere in the region; ongoing
violence in Iraq; and continued Israeli-Palestinian conflict
highlight the ever-widening gulf between the U.S. and
regional populations on how best to create conditions
necessary for security in the broader Middle East.
Initiatives identified ref A -- increased CT cooperation with
the Iraqi government, weighing in on GCC regional CT center
in Bahrain, and consulting with NGOs on programs to address
the psychology of extremism -- are worthwhile endeavors that
should be pursued. They are, however, long-term projects and
there is an immediate need for easy-to-implement and
effective programs. Posts' recommendations for such programs
follow.

¶3. (S REL AUS UK) As reported ref C, Embassy Kuwait has had
great success using the International Visitor Leadership
Program (IVLP) for engaging Kuwaiti imams. Riyadh has had
similar success. Participants, initially reluctant to travel
to the U.S. praised the openness of U.S. society and respect
for freedom of expression. Their experiences altered their
perception of the U.S. and deepened their understanding of
U.S. society. The trickle down effect of the participants
sharing their positive experiences with others is invaluable
when compared with the $150,000 we estimate it would cost for
a regional program for approximately 15 younger imams.
Embassy Kuwait anticipates it could easily identify ten
participants for such an IVLP project and has been asked by
the Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs, which has launched
a moderation campaign, for additional exchange opportunities.
Embassy Ankara's Pilot Country proposals include an exchange
initiative involving Turkish religious leaders and officials.
Ankara would be able to make good use of additional ECA
funds for this purpose.

¶4. (C REL AUS UK) Action Request: Posts recommend S/CT
work closely with ECA to establish regular single-country and
regional IVLP projects for imams, targeting younger preachers
and prayer leaders. After a few group projects, the program
could be expanded to include imams from Asia, Africa, and
Europe, destination areas for religious charitable
contributions from Gulf States.

¶5. (S/NF) Given the Iranian influence in the region and the
possibility that the GOI would respond to UNSC sanctions by
greater interference in Iraq and Lebanon, as well as Kuwait,
the UAE, Bahrain, and other Gulf countries, posts recommend
the Department fund a regional conference for Iran-watchers.
While Virtual Embassy Tehran
() is a
useful forum for reporting and information on Iran, it is
essential that the working-level officers charged with
monitoring and reporting on developments meet for a direct
exchange on this growing threat. Such a gathering would
allow for greater information-sharing and establish a
baseline for future, more comprehensive and targeted
reporting. Ideal participants would include mid-level
reporting/action officers from embassies Kuwait, Ankara,
Baghdad, Abu Dhabi, and other appropriate posts; the
Department (NEA, EUR, INR, and S/CT for example), DoD; and
SIMO. Despite the relatively small Iranian expatriate

community, Kuwait has a number of experts on Iran who use its
geographic proximity to travel there frequently. Embassy
Kuwait, with appropriate funding, would be pleased to host a
conference for 30 participants or inquire about the
availability of local experts to travel elsewhere to share
their views on Iran.

¶6. (S REL AUS UK) Action Request: Posts recommend
Department fund a working-level conference on Iran and
monitoring, analyzing, and reporting on its ambitions.

¶7. (S REL AUS UK) Much of the emphasis to promote greater
regional coordination has been targeted at the political and
security levels, such as the proposed biometrics conference
and expanded use of the JIPTC for training. One missing
component is the involvement of the region's academics and
think tanks. Within Kuwait, several academics serve as
Government advisors, helping to shape domestic and foreign
policy. The enhanced regional coordination we seek may be
advanced by encouraging closer relations at the
non-governmental level. Possible venues include the Kuwait
Center for Strategic Studies and the Kuwait University Center
for Strategic and Future Studies.

¶8. (U) Action Request: Working with other regional posts,
Embassy Kuwait, with regional input, would be willing to
develop an outline of themes to be addressed at a regional
conference which posts can use to approach possible hosts.
Posts recommend Department allocate $50,000 for a regional
conference.

¶9. (S REL AUS UK) Although many countries in the region have
recently established, or are in the process of establishing,
financial intelligence units (FIUs), comparatively few
prosecutions, asset forfeitures, or blockings have resulted.
Financial intelligence units, which leverage the vast
information resources of the private sector, frequently are
not fully integrated into the larger
investigatory/prosecutorial regime. This can result in the
underutilization of investigative resources and a lack of
actionable information for enforcement authorities and
prosecutors. Although MENA-FATF provides a forum for
financial information exchanges, it has not provided focused
prosecutorial/judicial training in the region.

¶10. (S REL AUS UK) Action Request: Posts recommend
Department fund a working-level conference that brings FIUs,
investigators, and prosecutors together to focus on producing
and effectively utilizing financial intelligence information
to drive terrorism/illicit-finance prosecutions in the
region's courts.
