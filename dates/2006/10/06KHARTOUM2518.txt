SUBJECT:  FORMER JANJAWEED IN SAF CLASH WITH SLA-MINAWI AND OTHER 
SAF IN EL FASHER 
 
REF: KHARTOUM 2469 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  A series of conflicts has erupted in El Fasher 
between former Janjaweed integrated into the Sudanese Armed Forces 
(SAF) and both SLA-Minawi members and other SAF forces.  These 
Janjaweed, who have been absorbed into the SAF Border Guard and 
Intelligence Forces, have looted markets, threatened shopkeepers, 
and exchanged fire with SLA-Minawi troops within the city.  Regular 
SAF units were deployed to control the situation on October 12, 
which led to some skirmishes between these troops and the former 
Janjaweed.

¶2. (SBU) On October 10, a fight broke out between these former 
Janjaweed and two SLA-Minawi members in the El Fasher market.  Some 
SLA-M soldiers responded by apprehending a former Janjaweed SAF 
soldier and holding him at their compound, which is near the AMIS 
Forward headquarters.  A series of low-level verbal and physical 
confrontations ensued until October 12, at which time Senior 
SLA-Minawi commander Ali Mukhtar told Active Response Corps (ARC) 
officer that the two sides resolved the issue and the soldier was 
released.  Mukhtar observed that these former Janjaweed are 
seemingly refusing to take orders from Sudanese regular army 
officers. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) During the same period, the former Janjaweed SAF Border 
Guards and Intelligence forces allegedly harassed shopkeepers and 
looted stores, leadng to many stores refusing to open due to the 
threat.  On October 12, the Wali of North Darfur, Othman Mohammed 
Yousif Kibbir, delivered a personal plea to shopkeepers at El 
Fasher's main market to return to work. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) While the Wali was speaking, the former Janjaweed soldiers 
began brandishing weapons at merchants who complained.  Regular SAF 
troops intervened and the former Janjaweed soldiers fled after an 
exchange of small-arms fire.  The Wali pledged to increase security 
at the market and a platoon-sized element of SAF paratroopers were 
positioned near the market's entrance and at other access points in 
a show of force. 
 
¶5.  This is not the first report of fighting between regular SAF 
forces and former Janjaweed integrated into the SAF Border Guards 
and Intelligence.  Tensions boiled over in September when fighting 
erupted on a local military base in El Fasher between the two 
groups.  Senior AMIS officers believe these former Janjaweed are 
taking orders directly from Khartoum and refuse to accept the 
authority of the local SAF chain of command.
