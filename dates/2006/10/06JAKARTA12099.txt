SUBJECT: TIMIKA TRIAL: LAST DAY OF VICTIM, EXPERT TESTIMONY 
 
REF: JAKARTA 11892 (WITNESS SNAFU) 
 
¶1. (SBU) On September 29, Central Jakarta court heard 
testimony from two victim witnesses and two expert witnesses 
in the trial of suspects charged in the 2002 murder of two 
Americans and one Indonesian near Timika, Papua.  Amcit 
victim witness Patsy Spier attended, accompanied by an 
interpreter and Embassy security personnel. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Courtroom security was heightened in response to the 
disruptions caused by demonstrators during the previous 
session (reftel).  Before the session opened, a court officer 
read out regulations on appropriate conduct in the courtroom. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The session opened at 13:00.  All the defendants 
appeared except for accused co-conspirator Hardi Sugimol, who 
is ill.  The prosecution produced a doctor's letter 
explaining Sugimol's condition, and which stated that he is 
recovering.  It was challenged by defense counsel Johnson 
Panjaitan, who said that the letter was written by 
prosecution staff, not a doctor, and that his client was ill, 
and not recovering as described in the letter. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The other defendants claimed that they were 
suffering from stress resulting from their incarceration and 
worry about their families, and that they had been unable to 
eat.  They therefore said they were too weak to attend the 
day's hearing.  Although Defense Attorney Panjaitan attempted 
to persuade them to stay, they insisted on leaving the 
courtroom.  Panjaitan wanted to stay on by himself, but the 
judge told him that it was against procedures for an attorney 
to represent his clients in court without the clients being 
present.  Panjaitan therefore left the courtroom as well. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) From about 14:45 to 15:30, the prosecution and 
judge questioned victim witness Yohannes Bawan, a Freeport 
driver who was present at the ambush.  Bawan was asked about 
his actions during the ambush, as well as what he heard and 
saw.  Bawan was followed on the stand by victim witness 
Ludwik Worotikan, who was shot during the ambush. 
Prosecutors asked him about his experiences during the 
ambush, as well as about the long-term effects of his injury. 
 His testimony lasted half an hour. 
 
¶6. (SBU) From 16:15 - 16:45, prosecutors questioned expert 
witness Dr. Wibisono who performed the initial autopsy on the 
body of Amcit victim Ricky Spier.  Dr. Wibisono provided a 
general description of the condition of the body, but 
declined to provide a detailed description of the bullet 
fragments he had found, saying that he was not an expert in 
ballistic matters.  From 16:45 - 17:25, Polri ballistics 
expert Syafrian was questioned about ballistic evidence found 
at the scene, including bullets and casings.  Syafrian 
offered his opinion on the types of weapons used in the 
crime.  The ballistic testing carried out by the FBI crime 
laboratory was mentioned only in passing. 
 
¶7. (SBU) At 17:30, court was adjourned until Tuesday, October 
3, at which time the cross-examination of the defendants will 
begin.
