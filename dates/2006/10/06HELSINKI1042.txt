SUBJECT: OCTOBER GAERC - FINNISH PRESIDENCY VIEWS 
 
REF: STATE 170214 
 
Classified By: POLCHIEF GREGORY THOME FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
¶1. (U) PolChief met with Finnish EU Correspondent Jarno 
Syrjala Oct. 12 to discuss the October GAERC.  Syrjala 
welcomed our demarche points and offered the following: 
 
SUDAN 
----- 
¶2. (SBU) Syrjala highlighted the increasing urgency that 
the EU feels regarding the need for a transition from an AU 
mission to a more robust UN force in Darfur.  The GAERC 
conclusions will reiterate that the EU and member states 
(the UK and the Netherlands, mainly) remain committed to 
funding AMIS until the end of the year.  However, he said, 
without the UN re-hatting, EU funding will become 
increasingly difficult to secure after January 2007. 
 
¶3. (C) Separately, Syrjala reported that the EU Troika met 
with the AU Executive Council in Brazzaville Oct. 10-11. 
Both EU and AU representatives specifically urged Sudanese 
FM Lam Akol to accept the UN re-hatting.  Akol did not 
openly reject a UN mission at the plenary sessions, but the 
Sudanese apparently remained as intransigent and as 
"difficult to work with as ever" in private meetings, 
Syrjala said. 
 
BALKANS 
------- 
¶4. (SBU) On Kosovo, Syrjala noted that the GOF will press 
the GAERC to adopt a conclusion strongly supportive of UN 
Special Representative Matti Ahtisaari, in part as a 
response to the increasingly negative public comments 
Belgrade has made regarding Ahtisaari's efforts.  In 
addition, the Troika is scheduled to meet PM Kostunica on 
the margins of the GAERC on Monday, before the GAERC holds 
formal discussions on Kosovo Tuesday.  The Troika will re- 
emphasize the importance of a final status agreement by 
January, and the fact that the EU and the US remain united 
on this.  Looking further down the road, the ministers will 
also discuss plans for a possible ESDP/policing mission, 
and Syrjala agreed fully with the need for close EU-NATO 
cooperation to ensure no security gaps. 
 
¶5. (SBU) On Bosnia, Syrjala said that the GAERC conclusions 
would likely focus on supporting the election results and 
urging the rapid formation of a government.  However, he 
added, some member states are becoming increasingly 
impatient with the pace of police, justice sector and other 
reforms in Bosnia and may press for a statement reflecting 
this frustration in any conclusion that refers to Bosnia's 
long-term EU perspectives. 
 
MIDDLE EAST/LEBANON 
------------------- 
¶6. (C) FM Tuomioja will travel to the region for meetings 
with Abbas and with the Israelis Oct. 13-14.  Tuomioja 
hopes to explore the possibility of Israel's releasing some 
funding for Palestinian Authority operations, using the 
EU's Temporary International Mechanism (TIM) to ensure that 
all funds stays well out of Hamas' hands.  The EU believes 
this could serve as a way to strengthen Abbas while also 
easing the humanitarian situation, but Syrjala predicted 
that neither the GOI nor Abbas himself will be overly 
enthusiastic.  Syrjala expressed full agreement with the US 
position regarding the Quartet principles as a prerequisite 
for any PA Unity Government, and lamented the fact that 
Abbas appears to have overestimated Hamas' willingness to 
behave responsibly in discussions aimed at a National Unity 
Government. 
 
¶7. (SBU) On Lebanon, plans for possible EU border security 
initiatives both in Lebanon and in Syria remain stalled. 
The EU is closer to agreement on police and possible 
security sector reform (SSR) initiatives with the Lebanese 
Armed Forces (LAF), which would complement US assistance to 
the LAF, Syrjala said.  Italy and others see a similar 
potential mission in Syria as a political test for the SARG 
-- that is, a chance for the Syrians to receive training 
from the Europeans and at the same time to show tangible 
support for UNSCR 1701.  However, France remains staunchly 
opposed.  Syrjala said that Solana will report on both 
iniatives, but at this point is not yet ready to make a 
 
HELSINKI 00001042  002 OF 002 
 
 
strong pitch for moving either forward. 
 
KOREA 
----- 
¶8. (SBU) Syrjala confirmed that North Korea has been added 
to the GAERC agenda, but did not view a formal conclusion 
as likely.  France and the UK will have the lead at the 
UNSC, and all 25 member states support the US positions, 
including a Chapter VII resolution with sanctions, he said.
