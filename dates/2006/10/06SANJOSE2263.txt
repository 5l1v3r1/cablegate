¶1.  SUMMARY: Costa Rica has restored diplomatic relations 
with Egypt, Kuwait, Bahrain and Yemen, following its decision 
to move its embassy in Israel from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv. 
The GOCR also plans to open embassies in India and Singapore. 
 The GOCR will use these newly-expanded ties to seek 
additional support for its election to the UNSC in 2008, one 
of the Arias Administration,s top foreign policy priorities. 
 END SUMMARY.

ARIAS SEEKS EXPANDED ROLE FOR COSTA RICA IN WORLD AFFAIRS 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
¶2.  Egypt and Costa Rica announced restoration of diplomatic 
relations at the Non-Aligned Movement conference in Havana on 
September 13.  While in New York for the UN General Assembly, 
Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bruno Stagno announced on 
September 25 that Costa Rica also would reestablish 
diplomatic relations with Kuwait, Bahrain, and Yemen.  While 
Stagno met with the Syrian foreign minister in New York, he 
added that they were not yet discussing reestablishing 
diplomatic relations, but would define their relationship in 
the near future.  On October 2, Stagno announced that the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) planned to open embassies 
in Egypt, India, and Singapore in 2007. 
 
¶3.  The restoration of diplomatic relations with the Arab 
world was triggered by Costa Rica's August 16 announcement 
that it would move its embassy in Israel from Jerusalem to 
Tel Aviv (reftel A, NOTAL).  In 1984, the Arab League asked 
members to sever diplomatic relations with Costa Rica because 
of then President Monge,s decision to move the embassy to 
Jerusalem.  According to media reports, Stagno told the 
Kuwaiti vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs at UNGA that Costa 
Rica,s major motivation to improve relations with the Arab 
world is to promote trade and attract foreign investment from 
the Middle East. 
 
¶4.  Minister Stagno presented the government,s plan to 
finance the new embassies during a hearing with the 
legislature,s finance committee on September 29. The MFA 
plans to close its embassy in Barbados and a consulate in New 
Orleans.  In addition, the MFA is seeking a 14% increase in 
its 2007 budget over 2006.  Besides new embassies, some of 
the extra money is slated for MFA officials to tour Asia and 
Africa to promote Costa Rica's UNSC bid. Additional personnel 
costs would not be high, since diplomats would be reassigned 
to staff the new missions. 
 
¶5.  During the hearing, Stagno presented his ministry,s 
foreign policy priorities, which include, in addition to 
closer relations with the Arab world: 
 
-- improving  the &international order,8 (e.g., UN reform); 
-- promoting major multilateral initiatives such as the Costa 
Rican Consensus (i.e., debt forgiveness and additional 
assistance for countries that  demilitarize) and an 
international conventional arms transfer treaty (ATT); and 
)- being elected to the UNSC in 2008.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶6.  While the Arias administration would certainly welcome 
foreign investment from, and increased trade with, the Arab 
world, the 2008 UNSC seat is also very important (Ref B). 
The additional embassies and the UNSC campaign will be 
costly, especially given the current fiscal situation in 
Costa Rica.  Stagno told the committee that it could cost as 
much as $6000/month to rent embassy space in Singapore, for 
example, while two MFA advisers confided to us on October 12 
that it would be difficult to find Costa Rican diplomats who 
spoke Arabic.  The Arias administration is willing to make 
this effort in order to maintain a place on the world stage. 
By starting the process now, the GOCR clearly intends to have 
the new missions in place in time to seek support from Arab 
 
nations and others before the 2008 UNSC elections next 
October.
