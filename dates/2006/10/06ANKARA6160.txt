In Today's Papers 
 
Turkey Celebrates National Day 
All papers report on celebrations for the 83rd anniversary of the 
foundation of the Republic of Turkey that took place around Turkey 
on Sunday.  President Ahmet Necdet Sezer said at a reception held at 
the Presidential Cankaya Palace that his term in office witnessed 
the most difficult years for Turkey since the establishment of the 
Republic.  "We should always be careful against threats targeting 
our democratic and secular Republic.  Any weakness will make such 
conscious threats permanent.  It is evident that some circles do not 
overlap with the image of modern Turkey.  Religion is a holy fact 
that should never be used for political ends.  Turkey has always 
been a modern country and will continue to be so," Sezer stressed. 
Mainstream papers and Cumhuriyet quote the Turkish General Staff 
(TGS) Chief General Yasar Buyukanit that "as a citizen of Turkey, I 
find President Sezer excellent.  He defends all the values of the 
Republic," without elaborating further whether his remarks had 
anything to do with the ongoing debate over who will replace Sezer 
next year as the new president of Turkey.  Buyukanit said it was not 
appropriate for the issue be turned into a polemic.  Sabah quotes 
opposition CHP leader Deniz Baykal as saying, "I hope Erdogan will 
not attempt to become the new president of Turkey.  The problem is 
the militant mentality with which Erdogan is eyeing the post." 
 
EU-Cyprus 
Sabah, Hurriyet, Milliyet and weekend papers:    Sabah reports that 
the EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn has criticized negative 
debates about Turkey's EU entry.  Rehn said that the debates had 
weakened Turkish determination for reform and damaged the EU's 
credibility.  Saturday's Zaman reported Rehn as saying that the 
Cyprus issue will "remain on the table until the EU's December 
summit meeting in Finland.  The commission will update the report if 
needed."  Rehn added that Turkey must fulfill its obligations 
towards Cyprus by the end of the year.  Saturday's Radikal noted 
that the EU draft report contained references about an earlier EU 
declaration on the Cyprus issue.  The declaration warns that talks 
between Turkey and the EU could suffer if Turkey fails to meet its 
responsibilities in Cyprus.  Milliyet reports that, commenting on 
the Finnish plan for solving the Cyprus issue, Prime Minister 
Erdogan said that "the plan is not reasonable and not different; 
nevertheless, we will consider the plan.'  Zaman covers the words of 
Greek-Cypriot leader Papadopulos in an interview with Filelefteros 
newspaper as saying that "to continue the negotiations, the least 
Turkey can do is return Varossa (Maras) to Greek Cypriots." 
 
Turkey-Iraq Joint Economic Committee Meeting 
Hurriyet reports that Turkey and Iraq will hold their 16th joint 
economic committee meeting.  Reportedly, Iraq wants to bargain about 
the control of Euphrates and Tigris rivers and asked Turkey to add 
"water resources" to the agenda of discussions.  However, last 
Friday the Foreign Trade Under secretariat rejected the Iraqi offer 
by saying that water resources were not linked to economic issues. 
 
 
Editorial Commentary on Iraq 
Washington-based Yasemin Congar argues in the mainstream Milliyet 
that the overall approach in Washington toward the future of Iraq is 
changing, pointing to the acceptance of a "loose federation" model: 
"There are both Democrats and Republicans who believe a more 
autonomous status in Iraq is needed for the Kurdish, Sunni and 
Shiite regions, and are seriously considering an agreement between 
the three regions on oil sharing.  There is also a positive approach 
to the idea of US forces stationed in northern Iraq as well as 
providing special status to Kirkuk and Baghdad under a federal 
structure.  The defenders of this plan also emphasize that the 
realization of these ideas require both an Iraq that does not serve 
as a base for the PKK and a modus vivendi between Turkey and Iraqi 
Kurdistan.  Even the strong supporters of the current Iraq policy 
within the administration, such as Edelman, the Pentagon's number

three, are keeping the door open for the possibility of redefining 
the federation for Iraq.  The fact of the matter is that a 'loose 
federation' formula is becoming the most realistic plan in the 
debates for the future structure of Iraq.  Now it remains to be seen 
if President Bush will also find himself closer to a realistic plan 
in the aftermath of the Congressional elections.  Does Turkey have a 
plan in case Washington moves toward a policy change?" 
 
Writing in the conservative Bugun, Nuh Gonultas notes the prospects 
of a US victory in Iraq are poor: "A back step from Washington on 
Iraq policy should not be expected due to the super-power's pride, 
yet the indications are leading to the conclusion that the US will 
be the loser in Iraq.  All of this does not come as surprise if we 
remember the fact that this war was based on a series of lies.  At 
this point we should feel sorry not only for Iraqis but also for the 
American people as long as Bush and the neo-cons remain in the 
power." 
 
USS Eisenhower Hosts Turkish Guests 
Sabah, Aksam and Zaman report US Ambassador in Turkey, Ross Wilson, 
invited a group of Turkish guests on board the USS Eisenhower over 
the weekend.  Sabah says "The giant American aircraft carrier USS 
Eisenhower returned to the Mediterranean at a time of growing 
speculation regarding military operations against Iran.  Zaman 
reports "USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, one of the largest aircraft 
carriers in the world, has returned to the Mediterranean after five 
years.  The aircraft carrier had been sent to the region under 
debates in the US press on operations against Iran.  Turkish guests 
on board had an opportunity to watch jetfighters taking off for 
operations.
