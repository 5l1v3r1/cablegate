Dear Ms. Rice, 
 
          Director General, World Health Organization 
 
     The Central People's Government of the People's Republic 
of China has nominated Dr. Margaret Chan as a candidate for 
the post of Director General of the World Health Organization 
(WHO).  The WHO Executive Board will decide on the 
candidature on 6-8 November 2006.  I write to recommend Dr. 
Chan to you and to appeal for your support for her candidacy. 
 
     Dr. Chan is an outstanding public health professional 
with integrity, strong sense of responsibility and solid 
professional and academic background.  She had a first-hand 
experience of over 25 years of working in the public health 
authority of Hong Kong, witnessing and rising to the various 
challenges of public health needs of a community evolved from 
a light manufacturing industry-based economy to a 
cosmopolitan city.  Before retiring from the Hong Kong civil 
service, Dr. Chan as the then Director of Health, was 
directly involved in tackling two unprecedented infectious 
diseases, both of which continue to remain a threat to global 
public health today - avian influenza and severe acute 
respiratory syndrome.  During her past three years at WHO, 
she continued to work in this area and led global efforts to 
strengthen preparedness for human pandemic influenza.  Such 
unparalleled experiences, highly relevant to the WHO's 
imminent tasks, makes her an ideal candidate for the Director 
General appointment.  I attach for your reference Dr. Chan's 
curriculum vitae and Election Manifesto. 
 
     Global public health is facing many challenges.  It 
takes extraordinary vision, talent, ability and commitment to 
lead such an important agency.  The Hong Kong community takes 
pride in having Dr. Chan as one of the candidates and fully 
supports her bid.  We believe that Dr. Chan is eminently 
qualified and fully capable of rising to the challenge.  I 
commend Dr. Chan to you.  As United States of America is a 
Member of the WHO Executive Board, I would like to urge your 
country to vote for Dr. Chan in the November election. 
 
Yours sincerely,
