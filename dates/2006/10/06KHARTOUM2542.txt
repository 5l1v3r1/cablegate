SUBJECT:  Sudan: MFA Advises Gov't to Search Diplomats 
 
¶1.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent a diplomatic note 
explaining that, for reasons of national security and the safety of 
air navigation, Government authorities would begin occasionally 
searching members of Diplomatic Missions and International 
Organizations, including physical searches.  To date, no members of 
the Embassy staff have been searched under this new policy.  This is 
referred to as a temporary measure based upon undefined "critical 
circumstances."

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of the Sudan 
presents its compliments to all Diplomatic Missions, International 
and Regional Organizations accredited to Khartoum and has the honor 
to inform them that the concerned authorities will occasionally 
conduct search of the personal effects and body search - whether 
they were from Diplomatic Missions or International Organizations 
for reasons regarding the national security and safety of air 
navigation. 
 
The Ministry hopes that all Diplomatic Missions and International 
Organizations would understand the critical circumstances motivating 
to these procedures and hopes they would be over soon. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Sudan avails 
itself of the opportunity to renew all Diplomatic Missions and 
International Organizations the assurances of its highest 
consideration.
