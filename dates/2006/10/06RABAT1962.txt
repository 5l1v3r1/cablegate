SUBJECT: MEPI SMALL GRANTS REPORT FOR MOROCCO 
 
REF: STATE 151114 
 
¶1.  Per reftel and telecoms with the Middle East Partnership 
Initiative (MEPI) Tunis Regional Office, post has been asked to 
report on two MEPI small grant proposals that are now complete - the 
Zagora Women's Computer Technology Workshop and the Tangier American 
Legation Museum literacy and vocational training program. 
 
¶2.  In October 2006, MEPI granted $26,047 to the Association 
Feminine de Developpement et Solidarite (AFDES) from Zagora to 
strengthen women's effective participation in society by providing 
20 local women's associations with training in computer technology. 
In addition, to promote sustainability of this program, AFDES 
provided train the trainer instruction to allow members of each 
association to teach computer skills to fellow association members. 
 
¶3.  Through the Zagora Technology Project, two technology teachers, 
a Peace Corps Volunteer and the AFDES president trained 40 women 
from associations in the Zagora region (two from each association) 
in information technology, computer repair and maintenance, advanced 
literacy and business management practices. Additionally, the 
technology coordinators have scheduled observation/evaluation days 
with association members in Zagora to ensure that the computer 
training skills learned by the students will be taught to their 
associations. Women have gained business experience, learned basic 
computer maintenance and reinforced their skills by teaching members 
from associations in information technology. 
 
¶4.  This program was very successful in achieving its goals and 
supporting post's efforts to promote female empowerment, as well as 
female inclusiveness in education and economic development.  The 
fact that members of 20 local associations have attained these 
skills helps assure that this information will be widely shared 
throughout local communities.  AFDES is a young organization, but it 
handled the implementation of this program well.  However, the 
organization would be challenged to maintain a larger grant.  Post 
would likely recommend continued funding if AFDES requested it, and 
we would recommend this type of proposal for other MEPI participant 
countries. 
 
¶5.  Per recent telecon with Tunis, the Tangier American Legation 
Museum literacy and vocational training program has already been 
reported to MEPI.
