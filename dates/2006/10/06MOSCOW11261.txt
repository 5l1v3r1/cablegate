REFTEL: USDOC 04979 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a Pre-license check to determine 
the legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, Tetis 
Pro, Moscow, Russia. The company is listed on BIS 
license application D363236 as the ultimate consignee 
of a modular multibeam echosounder system. These items 
are controlled for national security reasons under 
ECCN 6A001. The licensee is Reson, Inc., 100 Lopez 
Road, Goleta, Ca 93117. 
 
¶3. On September 29, 2006, Export Control Attache 
Donald Pearce and FSN Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested pre-license check at the offices of Tetis 
Pro, Ozernaya st., 42, Moscow, Russia. The export 
control team met with Alexander Yakovlev, Head of the 
Remote Operated Vehicles Department. 
 
¶4. Tetis Pro, founded in September 1991, is a supplier 
of commercial diving equipment and technical services 
for underwater operations.  The main clients of Tetis 
are the Ministry for Emergency Situations (Russian 
abbreviation MChS, sometimes referred to as EMERCOM) 
who are responsible for underwater search and rescue, 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russian abbreviation 
MVD) who are responsible for law enforcement divers, 
and oil and gas companies such as Lukoil and Gazprom. 
Tetis Pro is also building a deep-water rescue vehicle 
for the Russian Navy.  Commercial dive equipment is 
not produced in Russia, so the company imports almost 
all equipment from outside of Russia.  Tetis Pro has 
working relationships with several U.S. companies, 
such as Bauer-Poseidon, Stanley Tools, and Ocean 
Technical Systems, among others.  Over the past two to 
three years, Tetis Pro has seen profits of around 
2,000,000 USD, making it the leading commercial diving 
supplier in Russia. 
 
¶5. The echosounder in reftel will be utilized in an 
oceangoing system for search and rescue.  Tetis Pro is 
designing the system for the Ministry for Emergency 
Situations (Russian abbreviation MChS, also known as 
EMERCOM). Tetis began working with Reson four years 
ago, through their Denmark headquarters.  The company 
bought several single-beam echosounders for the 
Transneft company, the Russian state unitary company 
responsible for pipelines. Those Echosounders are used 
in shallow water for survey purposes. 
 
¶6. The echosounder will be stored at Tetis Pro prior 
to its delivery to the MChS.  Tetis Pro has a storage 
facility on site, with a 24 hour attendant security 
guard.  The storage area is alarmed, and access is 
limited to company personnel with responsibilities in 
the warehouse.  As the company is a government 
contractor, all personnel are required to go through 
an FSB First Directorate background check.  When 
transferred to MChS, the system will be in the 
possession of the Central Squadron Special Operations 
group, who is responsible for waterborne operations. 
 
¶7. Tetis Pro took delivery of a multi-beam echosounder 
of similar specifications from Reson in May.  The unit 
was used by Mr. Yakovlev during a rescue operation for 
a downed Russian airliner in the Black Sea, and 
successfully located the site of the debris field. 
Mr. Yakovlev showed the team a Reson system with a 
Federal Acoustics echosounder, model EM-7187, Serial 
Number 0806139. 
 
¶8. Recommendations: Post recommends Tetis Pro, Moscow, 
Russia, as reliable recipients of sensitive U.S. 
origin commodities. It is requested that post be 
notified of final disposition of the application, and 
of any shipments for this organization in order to 
conduct appropriate FCS follow-up and statistical 
reporting.
