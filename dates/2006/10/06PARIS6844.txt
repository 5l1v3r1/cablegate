MBDA France Missile Systems Contract Management Department 
Head Patrick Bernard contacted the Embassy by fax with 
additional information regarding license 05-1004053 for the 
export of recorders, producers, and related equipment to 
France.  Bernard confirmed MBDA's order of MSSR-2000-SA 
recording equipment from EXPAN, located at 22, rue Mozart, 
92110 Clichy, France.  Bernard said that they have not had 
difficulties with EXPAN during previous orders.  Bernard 
confirmed that the order would be used only for MBDA itself, 
not the French Armed forces, to test the parameters of 
acquisitions in the EXOCET AM39 missile program in France, as 
noted in the May 2006 end-use statement.
