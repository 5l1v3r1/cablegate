Classified By: Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker, Reasons 1.4  (b) and (d) 
 
¶1.  (C)  MG  Tariq Salim Malik, Additional Secretary of 
Ministry of Defense Production (MODP), signed the Letter of 
Acceptance (LOA) to purchase 18 F-16s Saturday evening, 
September 30.  Following the private signing ceremony, MODP 
presented to Office of Defense Representative Pakistan a side 
memo, the text of which is printed in paragraph 3. 
 
¶2.  (C)  Comment: We consider the memo to be separate from 
the LOA, which constitutes a valid legal contract.  Many of 
the issues raised in the memo were addressed and resolved in 
President Musharraf's Washington D.C. meetings with President 
Bush, Secretary Rumsfeld, and other USG principals.  In 
preparing a response, post encourages USG agencies to include 
references to the understandings regarding the F-16 LOA that 
came out of those Washington meetings.    End Comment.

Subject:    Signing of F-16 LOAs 
 
¶1.    All the three F-16 Package LOAs (PK-D-SAF, PK-D-NAP, 
PK-D-YAD) are being signed subject to the following 
conditions: - 
 
a.    On the method and schedule of payments we request that 
Pakistan Be allowed to avail clause 4.4.6 of the LOA Standard 
Terms and conditions; which allows payment on delivery rather 
cash prior to deliver.  If this is absolutely impossible then 
we suggest as an alternative, that the schedule of payments 
be modified.  Under the existing schedule for the 3 LOAs, out 
of the total package of $2965.95 million, 83% or $2450.23 
million are to be paid by 2009-10, the first four years of 
the programme.  This schedule will be an immense strain on 
Pakistan,s fiscal and foreign exchange resources, posing 
sever constraints on Pakistan,s ability to invest in the 
social and fiscal infrastructure.  This will jeopardize 
Pakistan,s growth and poverty alleviation prospects in a 
particularly challenging period.  We, therefore, request that 
the payment schedule be back loaded in a manner that most of 
the payments fall in the last three years of the programme. 
 
b.    If during the contract process and delivery schedule of 
items in the LOAs, delivery is stopped for any reason, 
complete payments for the undelivered stores will be returned 
to the Govt of Pakistan immediately without pre-conditions. 
 
c.    Security:   With respect to the security note 64 to LOA 
PK-D-SAF Note 58 of LOA PK-D-YAD and note 73 of LOA PK-D-NAP, 
it is opined that whereas GOP agrees to take effective 
measures to protect all US equipment in Pakistan including 
F-16 aircraft, AMRAAMS, hardware and technical data, it is 
considered that certain aspects of these notes and their sub 
clauses are the forte and responsibility of the GOP.  These 
security notes therefore need further deliberation and 
rationalization.  It is requested that discussion for the 
same may be initiated at the earliest between the two sides. 
 
d.    LOAs are being signed.  Confirmation will however be 
subject to approval by the Federal Cabinet of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan.

¶2.    As an ally that throughout its existence has always 
stood by the US, whatever the challenges and risks, Pakistan 
expects that its difficulties will be appreciated and the US 
Government will respond positively.
