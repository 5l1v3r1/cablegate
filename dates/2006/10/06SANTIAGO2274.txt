¶1. On October 30, business and financial "Diario Financiero" (circ. 
30,000) carried a column by international commentator Libardo 
Buitrago entitled "Iraq: Bush's Swamp."  Quote: 
 
"Iraq's sands have become a serious trap for President George Bush's 
administration.  All the alternatives to solve the situation in Iraq 
are bad...  This war has finally become the axis of the 
Congressional campaign....  Even the President has admitted a 
parallel with the war in Vietnam.  And he continues to speak about 
victory while it is something that seems unlikely....  Some U.S. 
officials blame the latest violence (in Iraq) as an attempt by the 
insurgents and terrorists to influence the American electoral 
campaign -- which does not seem preposterous.  But it also reflects 
the failure of the recent American redeployment to give a leading 
role to the Iraqi forces." 
 
¶2. On October 28, government-owned, editorially independent "La 
Nacion" (circ. 4,200) carried a piece by international analyst Raul 
Sohr.  Quote: 
 
"The last thing that the United States can allow itself is to open 
another front (against Iran).  With regard to Iraq, Teheran is 
currently holding the winning cards.  The U.S. stance will be 
determined both by what occurs in the Middle East as with what will 
happen in the upcoming November 7 congressional elections."
