On January 17, AIT both delivered ref B demarche and reported 
Taiwan's initial response in ref A.  On February 15, the 
Taiwan Ministry of Justice Department of Prosecutorial 
Affairs Director Shawn Tsai (Ching-hsiung) reported to AIT 
that in light of the human rights and other issues raised in 
the demarche, Taiwan had voted against Burma's membership in 
the Asia Pacific Group Against Money Laundering (APG) and had 
used its position on the APG Steering Committee to urge other 
APG members to also vote against Burma's membership.
