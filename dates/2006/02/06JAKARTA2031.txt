REF: STATE 23668 
 
(SBU)  We delivered and discussed reftel points February 15 
with Wahib, DFA Deputy Director for Middle Eastern Affairs, 
and urged public expressions of congratulations from the 
Indonesian Government to the Iraqi people on their successful 
election and support for efforts to form a new government. 
Wahib replied that the GOI was supportive of Iraq's 
transition to democracy and optimistic that the Iraqis would 
form a new government in due time.  He stated that the GOI 
would likely hold off on public statements until after an 
Iraqi Prime Minister and President were in place, at which 
time President Yudhoyono would offer a formal statement of 
congratulations.  Wahib said that staff from the Indonesian 
Embassy in Amman had recently inspected GOI diplomatic 
property in Baghdad, but the GOI was waiting for a more 
stable security situation to re-open its mission in Iraq.
