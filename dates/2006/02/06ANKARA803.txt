In Today's Papers 
 
Controversial HAMAS Visit to Ankara 
All papers:  A surprise visit by Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal 
to Ankara escalated tensions in Turkey and Israel.  There is 
controversy initiative over whose initiative the visit was, 
with AKP officials saying Hamas first approached Ankara 
about the visit and columnists Cengiz Candar and Ibrahim 
Karagul writing that it was initiated by the Turkish 
government.  The delegation met with AKP officials and 
Foreign Minister Gul.  In a statement, FM Gul noted that the 
victory of Hamas in the Palestinian elections was the result 
of the democratic process and should be respected.  Gul 
added that these are critical times in which the right 
messages must be conveyed to Hamas.  Foreign Ministry 
officials stressed that the invitation to Hamas was extended 
by the governing AKP, not the Foreign Ministry.  Mashaal was 
scheduled to meet with PM Erdogan, but following criticism 
by Israel and several European countries, the Prime Ministry 
announced that the meeting would not take place.  Israel 
warned that the visit could cause damage to Turkish-Israeli 
relations that would be difficult to repair.  Israeli FM 
Livni protested the visit, saying that Israel did not need 
mediators to start talks with Hamas and that talks could 
start immediately if Hamas gives up terrorism, recognizes 
Israel, and promises to support the Middle East peace 
process.  The State Department summoned the Turkish 
Ambassador in Washington to protest the invitation, stating 
it amounts to meeting with a terrorist leader.  Speaking to 
a group of journalists in Ankara, Ambassador Wilson said: 
"Our principal concern is that any meeting with Hamas should 
deliver this same message about abandoning terrorism, 
recognizing the right of Israel to exist, and adhering to 
the commitments that the Palestinian Authority has made. 
Any meeting has to make clear to Hamas that it must take 
these steps to have international legitimacy." 
 
With the exception of Islamist oriented commentators, 
editorials did not very welcome the visit and expressed 
skepticism about the success of AKP government's effort to 
be a mediator on the Palestine issue.  Several writers 
worried that this "meaningless diplomacy" would harm Turkey. 
 
Calling the Hamas initiative "shortsighted", the editor-in- 
chief of mass appeal daily Hurriyet Ertugrul Ozkok wrote: 
"Ankara has taken one of the most pointless and ill-timed 
steps in diplomatic history.   For some reason, Prime 
Minister and his close aides are very keen to play a 
mediating role, but they are not thinking it through.  They 
should realize that each pointless diplomatic step they take 
will make Turkey's role as mediator more difficult than 
before.  And for every such step a price will be paid." 
 
Editor-in-chief Ismet Berkan of the liberal-intellectual 
Radikal wrote: "Hamas stands at a crucially important 
juncture concerning its own existence and future destiny. 
Ankara would be able to accomplish a historic mission if it 
really could convince Hamas to lay down its weapons. 
Looking at it honestly, though, I just don't believe that 
Hamas will accept these conditions and take these steps.  I 
hope I am wrong." 
 
Mainstream daily Sabah carried this commentary by editor-in- 
chief Fatih Altayli: "Hamas is a terrorist organization that 
is strengthening its political wing.  The western world is 
approaching Hamas with extreme caution and wants everyone 
else to do the same.  This message was also given to Turkey. 
The Turkish leadership, however, opted to invite Hamas at 
this sensitive moment.  The Prime Minister, in order not to 
 
ANKARA 00000803  002 OF 003 
 
 
run afoul of his party base, told Hamas that he would meet 
with them.  But then western countries stepped in, and the 
Prime Minister was forced to cancel.  In this way, we threw 
away the possibility of playing a future role in this issue. 
Both the West and Hamas have lost confidence in us.  Nobody 
in the AKP can tell me the visit is acceptable because Hamas 
was elected.  What would we think if the PKK were elected 
tomorrow in northern Iraq, and one of our allies met with 
them?  Let's also remember the Turkish reaction when an 
elected official who supports the PKK was invited to the 
United States.  If you throw a fit and prevent the Americans 
from meeting with him, they would naturally see it as their 
right to do the same.  Why wouldn't they?" 
 
Calling the Hamas visit "problematic", senior commentator 
Okan Gonensin observed in the mass appeal Vatan: "The Middle 
East issue is a combination of many elements and cannot be 
reduced to the Palestine-Israeli dispute alone.  The Iran 
crisis, the Iraq occupation, and tension over Syria and 
Lebanon are all part of the same set of issues, and each 
particular problem is related to the others.  Under these 
circumstances, mediation is difficult and requires enormous 
diplomatic skill as well as significant political clout. 
Any mistake in the process can easily turn one of the 
parties into an enemy.  Leaving aside the question of who 
took the initiative on the visit of Hamas, the result is a 
good reminder that this is a difficult and dangerous game." 
 
Drawing parallels between the election victory of Hamas and 
the existence of the PKK in northern Iraq, Islamist oriented 
Yeni Safak's columnist Ibrahim Karagul argued: "By putting 
Hamas on its list of terrorist organizations, the US is 
trying to create instability in Palestine.  Hamas is on the 
US terrorist list -- but how about the PKK, which is on 
Turkey's list?  The PKK has enjoyed American protection 
since the occupation of Iraq began in 2003.  Turkey's 
requests regarding the PKK have never been heeded.  There is 
no reason for Hamas to disarm at this time.  As the Hamas 
leader said, the US is trying to disarm Hamas at the same 
time that Kurdish groups in northern Iraq are provided with 
more weapons. .Apparently both Israel and the US, especially 
the neo-conservatives, are feeling uneasy about this visit. 
The visitors are the new leaders of Palestine, so they had 
better get used to it." 
 
US Aircraft Carrier 'USS Roosevelt' Anchors in Marmaris 
Yeni Safak, Aksam, Vatan, Posta:  Returning from its support 
duties in Iraq, the aircraft carrier 'USS Roosevelt' 
anchored in Marmaris early Thursday morning.  The aircraft 
carrier has the capacity to carry 87 planes.  Reportedly, 
5,300 military personnel were on the ship for the last six 
months and will have four days of liberty in Marmaris. 
Aksam writes that three hotels in Marmaris were fully booked 
for the crew and gives the names of the hotels. 
 
US Asks for Turkey's Support on Iran's Nuclear Program 
Yeni Safak:  US Ambassador to the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) Greg Schulte urged Turkey to act 
together with the international community against Iran. 
Ambassador Schulte said in a press roundtable yesterday it 
was important that responsible members of the international 
community not let Iran divide them.  Iran's goal is to 
produce nuclear weapons.  If they succeed, it will pose a 
threat to Turkey. Increasing diplomatic pressure on Iran 
will be a long, difficult task.  The most important thing is 
that the international coalition against Iran's development 
of nuclear weapons hold together.

conveyed the Administration's request to Congress for an 
additional $75 million this year to build democracy in Iran. 
Rice said that "the Iranians are seeking freedom under a

satellite television broadcasting and for programs to help 
Iranians to study abroad."
