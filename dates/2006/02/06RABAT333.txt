¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY: On February 17, 2006 visiting NEA/MAG 
Office Director William Jordan met separately with MFA 
Director of Bilateral Affairs Youssef Amrani and MFA Director 
of American Affairs Salahuddin Tazi to discuss bilateral 
issues and the Western Sahara (septel).  Accompanying NEA/MAG 
Director were DCM, Polcouns, and Poloff.  Tazi stressed that 
Morocco is in a unique position to play a "bridge" role for 
the U.S. on cooperation matters.  Expressing the GOM's desire 
for more USG financial assistance, Tazi explained that, in 
addition to positive economic effects, additional financial 
support can contribute to the stability of Morocco.  On press 
freedoms, Jordan explained to Amrani that U.S. comments on 
Moroccan press freedoms are not meant to be negative, but 
should be viewed as encouragement to take critical next steps 
towards a more open press environment.  DCM added that the 
GOM has full control over the progress of press freedoms and 
there is little space for external factors to slow progress. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
Bilateral Affairs: Assistance, Partnership, and Press 
Freedoms 
--------------------------------------------- ----------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Visiting NEA/MAG Office Director William Jordan on 
February 17, 2006 paid separate calls on Youssef Amrani, MFA 
Director of Bilateral Affairs, and Salahuddin Tazi, MFA 
Director of American Affairs.  DCM, Polcouns, and Poloff 
attended both meetings.  Tazi used this opportunity to 
express the GOM,s desire for more USG financial support. 
Pointing out that Morocco has taken positive steps on 
governmental responsibility, accountability, and 
transparency, Tazi stressed that Morocco, as a partner of the 
U.S. and a country with the same objectives as the U.S., can 
play the role of "bridge" for the U.S. on cooperation issues. 
 Citing the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA), Tazi noted 
that Morocco, given its extensive knowledge of MCA criteria, 
has been approached by Cameroon to discuss MCA eligibility. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Tazi argued that financial assistance, in addition 
to having positive economic effects, can also contribute to 
the stability of Morocco.  The more stable Morocco is, the 
more Morocco can defend the interests of the U.S. and 
Morocco, explained Tazi.  Jordan stressed that USG assistance 
should complement greater human development, and that 
Morocco's MCA eligibility opens up new doors for assistance. 
He added that Morocco is a vital and active partner of the 
U.S. in this region, and as such, Morocco should share its 
expertise with other countries in the region.  Commenting on 
GOM efforts to promote human development, Tazi explained that 
Morocco needs to develop the country and provide jobs, 
particularly in rural areas, so that terrorists cannot be 
easily recruited.  The King's National Initiative for Human 
Development (INDH), as Tazi said, recognizes and takes a 
fresh and hard look at poverty in Morocco and is creating a 
strategy to tackle this problem. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Tazi emphasized the positive and frank dialogue the 
GOM has with the Embassy, including on sensitive issues such 
as freedom of the press.  Jordan emphasized that U.S. remarks 
on the state of Moroccan press freedoms should not be viewed 
as negative criticism, but should be seen by the GOM as 
encouragement to take critical next steps.  Tazi responded 
that a bill to decriminalize libel is being discussed and 
will be presented to parliament very soon.  DCM added, and 
Tazi acknowledged, that progress, or lack thereof, on freedom 
of expression may harm Morocco's future MCA eligibility, and 
progress on freedom of expression is something that is solely 
in the control of the GOM, with little room for external 
factors to cause delay.  He urged the GOM to continue to push 
forward legislation to decriminalize libel. 
 
¶6.  (U) NEA/MAG Office Director Jordan has cleared this cable.
