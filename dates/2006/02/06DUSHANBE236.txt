¶1.  (U) Sensitive but unclassified.  Please handle accordingly. 
Not for public Internet. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  The Russian Ambassador convened the other 
G-8 ambassadors on February 2 to announce a cooperative effort 
during the Russian G-8 presidency.  Although this seems to be 
mostly a public relations effort, it is welcome.  We will seize 
the opportunity to promote concrete cooperation where possible, 
especially in counter-narcotics and counterterrorism.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  (U) Russian Ambassador to Tajikistan Ramazan Abdulatipov 
invited the representatives of the G-8 nations resident in 
Dushanbe to his embassy on February 2.  The UK, French, and U.S. 
ambassadors and the German and Japanese charges attended.  Italy 
and Canada do not have resident missions in Dushanbe.  Each 
participant received an information package that included a 
four-page history of Russia's participation in the G-7/G-8, two 
pages of press statements by President Putin on Russia's right 
to be in the G-8 (including from his January 31 press 
conference), and a five-point agenda proposal for the coming 
year: 
 
-- That the G-8 ambassadors meet quarterly during the year; 
 
-- That they conduct joint press conference on the progress of 
G-8 work in the region; 
 
-- That they organize regular joint meetings with Tajik 
officials responsible for combating narcotics and terrorism; 
 
-- That they organize informal meetings with the Tajik Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs to assess G-8 work in Tajikistan; and 
 
-- That an international conference take place in Fall 2006 in 
Dushanbe, "Energy and Ecological Security in Central Asia: 
Problems and Possibilities," organized by the German Ebert 
Foundation and the U.S. Marshall Fund, with participation by 
research centers from the United States, United Kingdom, France, 
and Japan, with the G-8 diplomatic corps and international media 
in attendance. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The UK Ambassador, given first response, welcomed the 
Russian initiative.  When the U.S. Ambassador praised the 
initiative and welcomed the Russian spirit of cooperation, 
Abdulatipov said that Russia wants to demonstrate that in 
Central Asia it can work with, rather than compete with, other 
countries.  The U.S. Ambassador asked if such G-8 "cooperative 
meetings" were taking place in the other Central Asian capitals, 
Ambassador Abdulatipov responded that "this is an initiative 
from our Foreign Ministry, of course."  The French Ambassador 
and the German Charge pressed for the local EU working-level 
representative to be included in all meetings "since the EU is a 
de facto member of the G-8."  Ambassador Abdulatipov demurred 
and said the meetings are for full members only, "although 
occasional observers will not be turned away." 
 
¶5.  (SBU) COMMENT:  The Russian initiative is a welcome public 
relations effort.  That said, the meeting at the Russian Embassy 
had an element of kabuki theater.  Abdulatipov, although 
formally cordial, appeared somewhat uneasy, and the meeting was 
relatively stiff.  There was a check-the-box quality to his 
effort.  Nevertheless, Embassy Dushanbe will use this Russian 
initiative to promote concrete Russian-U.S. efforts in 
 
DUSHANBE 00000236  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
counter-narcotics and counter-terrorism, at the least.  END 
COMMENT.
