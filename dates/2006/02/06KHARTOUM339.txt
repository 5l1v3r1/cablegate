¶1.  Paulino Matip and Simon Gatwick traveled to Jonglei 
this week to help ensure peace is maintained there, 
following last week's fighting between Nuer tribesmen and 
SPLA troops (reftel).  Matip is expected back in Juba 
this weekend, and the area has reportedly stabilized. 
 
¶2. GoSS Presidential Decree 20/2006 officially 
established Paulino Matip as the Deputy Commander-in- 
Chief of the SPLA, second only to Salva Kiir.  Decrees 21 
and 22 established the political committee that will 
oversee implementation of the Juba Declaration and the 
military committee that will implement the agreement, 
respectively.  Decree 24 granted a general amnesty to all 
members of the SPLA and SSDF as of January 21 (Note: 
Although Gordon Kong calls his organization the SSDF, 
only Paulino Matip's faction is legally recognized as the 
SSDF in Southern Sudan.  End note.) 
 
¶3. GoSS Presidential Decree 23/2006 appointed SSDF 
general Changson Lew Chang to the newly created position 
of Minister for Parliamentary Affairs.  The nature of the 
new ministry has yet to be clearly defined, but will most 
likely serve as a liaison between the GoSS executive and 
the Southern assemblies (at both the sub-national and 
state levels).  This is the 22nd ministry to be 
established.  Only the position of Minister for SPLA 
Affairs, the equivalent of the Minister of Defense, 
remains open. 
 
¶4.  The Archbishop of Canterbury, accompanied by the 
Archbishop of Salisbury, will be in Renk, Upper Nile 
State, on February 25 to confirm the new Episcopalian 
bishop there. 
 
¶5.  Abel Alier, former vice president of the republic, 
was in Juba to conduct a series of high-level meetings. 
 
¶6.  The Government of Southern Sudan (GoSS) Council of 
Ministers failed to meet this week due to a lack of 
quorum.  It plans to try again next week when Nhial Deng 
returns from Egypt and ministers Michael Makuai, David 
Deng, and Albino Akol are present. 
 
¶7.  Under Secretary of Cooperative and Rural Development 
Bortel Mori told CG Juba officials that the first job of 
the ministry will be to map all the water access points 
in the south and determine where new bore holes are 
needed. Future goals include organizing and training farm 
cooperatives, providing micro-financing to rural 
entrepreneurs, and buying trucks to help farmers get 
their goods to market.  Mori said the greatest threats to 
rural development were landmines, disease, sanitation, 
and transportation challenges.
