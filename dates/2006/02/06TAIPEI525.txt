SUBJECT: ANTI-AMERICAN DEMONSTRATION AT AIT-TAIPEI 
 
 
¶1. (U) On Tuesday 21 February 2006, approximately one hundred 
and fifty (150) supporters from the Taiwan Solidarity Union 
(TSU) political party and other affiliated pro-Taiwan 
independence groups, staged an anti-American protest outside 
the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT-Taipei).  The 
protesters first gathered at a nearby public park and then 
marched to AIT-Taipei to conduct their demonstration. 
Arriving around 1353 hours local time, the demonstrators 
shouted anti-American slogans and carried numerous 
pro-independence signs that read "Abolish the NUC" and 
"Taiwan Does Not Equal China."  One of the protest 
organizers, HUANG Chao-tang, gave a brief speech articulating 
why the U.S. government should not oppose Taiwan President 
CHEN Shui-bian's proposal to abolish the National Unification 
Council (NUC).  HUANG then handed a statement to the local 
police precinct commander monitoring the protest.  In the 
one-page statement written in Chinese, HUANG called upon the 
U.S. to respect Taiwan's "sovereignty" and support the 
democratic decision-making process.  Once the statement was 
delivered, the protesters marched out of the area without 
incident at 1415 hrs. 
 
¶2. (U) The protest was covered extensively by both the local 
broadcast and print media.  AIT's Public Affairs section 
however, received no media inquiries regarding this event. 
 
¶3. (SBU) National Police Administration (NPA) contacts 
notified the RSO almost five days in advance about the 
possibility of a protest and deployed one hundred uniformed 
officers in front of the Consular section to maintain order. 
SDT units and Local Guard Force (LGF) personnel were also put 
on alert and monitored the protest to ensure that Consular 
operations were not disrupted.  No unusual incidents, arrests 
or injuries were reported.
