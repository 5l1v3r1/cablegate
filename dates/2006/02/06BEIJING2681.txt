 (SBU) Poloff met with MFA West Asian and North African 
Affairs Department Desk Officer Wang Yongjun on February 10 
to deliver reftel points regarding conditions for USG 
assistance to a new Palestinian Authority government after 
the January 25 Palestinian Legislative Council elections. 
Wang undertook to report the U.S. message and referred Poloff 
to the Foreign Ministry,s brief February 7 statement that 
Beijing hopes for a smooth transition in the Palestinian 
Authority and that any Palestinian party in power should 
follow UN resolutions and the principle of land for peace. 
When pressed by Poloff for his thoughts regarding how to 
reconcile a new Palestinian Authority government with PRC 
anti-terrorism commitments, Wang declined to comment further.
