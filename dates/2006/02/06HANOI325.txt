Â¶1. (SBU) Pol/C met with MFA West Asia and Africa Department 
Deputy Director General Duong Huynh Lap February 14 to 
deliver reftel points.  Lap described Vietnam's relations 
with the Palestinian Authority and President Abbas as "very 
good."  Since the PLO established an office in Hanoi in 
1976, Vietnam has enjoyed a "traditional relationship" with 
Palestine.  Vietnam supports the Palestinian cause, 
including self-determination and the right to establish an 
independent state.  At the same time, Vietnam urges all 
parties to resolve their issues peacefully, believes that 
Israel's right to exist must be respected and recognized and 
supports the Roadmap and the Quartet's efforts.
