¶1.  (SBU) Ambassador met February 9 with Ameerah Haq, Deputy 
to the Special Representative of the Secretary General 
(UNAMA).  Haq confirmed President Karzai's selection of the 
GOA's representatives on the Afghan side of the Afghanistan 
Compact's joint Coordinating and Monitoring Board.  Dr. 
Nadiri, Senior Economic Advisor to the President, will be 
the GOA co-chair.  The other members will include the 
Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Finance, Economy, 
Reconstruction and Rural Development, Justice (the latter 
being a replacement for Commerce) and Dr. Rassoul from the 
NSC. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) UNAMA is weighing how the international component 
of the joint board will be set up.  Haq believes a minimum 
of ten international members will be required.  The GOA is 
expected to accept this arrangement even though there will 
be only seven members on the Afghan side.
