Ref: A) State 20173; B) 5 Hanoi 1830 
 
¶1. (SBU) During a meeting on Februry 10, the Charge 
delivered Ref A's talking poins to Assistant Foreign 
Minister and Americas Deprtment Director General Nguyen Duc 
Hung.  AFM Hun explained that Vietnam normally supports the 
reional consensus candidate, but that the current siuation 
complicated things.  Hung also added that following last 
year's agreement to open diplomaic offices in each other's 
capital (Ref B), the Vnezuelan Charge had recently arrived 
in Hanoi.  n the subject of whether to support Venezuela or 
Guatemala, Vietnam has not yet made its decision, AFM Hung 
said. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment:  The recent arrival of the Venezuelan 
Charge, combined with the longstanding, "traditional 
friendship" between Vietnam and Cuba, may make Guatemala's 
candidacy here a tough sell.  We will continue to encourage 
our MFA interlocutors to support Guatemala's bid.  End 
Comment.
