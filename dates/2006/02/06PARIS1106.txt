¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  Ambassador Oliver spoke with the 
Ambassador of the Netherlands on February 17, 2006 and 
confirmed that the Dutch Ambassador still plans to run for 
the Group I seat on the International Programme for the 
Development of Communication (IPDC) Bureau.  In the 
meantime, the Greek Ambassador has told the Dutch that he 
would like to run for a split seat with them - a total 
reversal of his previous stance to step aside if the U.S. 
wanted to run for a shared seat with the Netherlands (an 
earlier U.S. suggestion).  The Dutch Ambassador, however, 
was uninterested.  Ambassador Oliver told her that she 
agreed with point(reftel) that now might not be a good time 
for the U.S. to run against the Danish Presidency of the 
IPDC, given the current political situation.  Given the 
changing circumstances, Mission recommends not running for 
the IPDC Chair or the Group One seat, rather committing 
150,000 USD in ICSECA funds to the IPDC and perhaps running 
for the bureau in 2007.

GREEK ABOUT FACE

¶2.  (SBU) The Dutch Ambassador stated that Greece had 
offered to split the seat, serving in it from 2006 to 2007, 
while the Netherlands would serve in the seat from 2007 to 
¶2008.  This came as a surprise to all, since the Greek 
Ambassador had previously been supportive of a U.S. 
suggestion to run for a shared seat with the Netherlands. 
In exchange for this deal, the Greek Ambassador "guaranteed" 
that, as the 2007 chair of Group I, he could run for and win 
a second term in 2007.  He would then share it with the 
Netherlands, so that each side served the equivalent of a 
full 2-year term.  However, the Dutch Ambassador confided to 
Ambassador Oliver that she did not trust the Greek 
Ambassador, and besides her government and national 
Commission for UNESCO wanted her to only run for a 2-year 
term.

¶3.  (SBU) Ambassador Oliver noted the continuing global 
furor over Danish political cartoons negatively depicting 
Muslims, and stated that she agreed with the Dutch 
Ambassador's assessment that now might not be the best time 
to approach Denmark about stepping down from the IPDC 
Presidency.  The Dutch Ambassador was very pleased to note 
this.

MISSION RECOMMENDATIONS 
----------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Given the changing circumstances, Mission 
recommends not running for the Presidency of the IPDC unless 
the current Danish President, who plans to run again, 
changes his mind for some unexpected reason.    Mission does 
not plan to run this year against the Netherlands for the 
Group I seat since the Netherlands will get all of the votes 
from the EU member states in Group I.  Therefore, to 
demonstrate U.S. commitment to the IPDC, Mission recommends 
giving 150,000 USD of the existing ICSECA funds to the IPDC 
and perhaps running for the bureau in 2008.
