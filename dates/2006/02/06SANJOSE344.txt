Classified By: Ambassador Mark Langdale for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
Post does not believe it would be productive to solicit any 
contributions from the GOCR.  Costa Rica, which abolished its 
own armed forces in 1948, maintains strict neutrality and 
non-belligerence with respect to all military conflicts that 
affect other states.  This is not simply the policy of the 
current government, but a matter of constitutional law 
expressed in a 2004 Supreme Court decision that forced the 
GOCR to formally withdraw its political support for the 
U.S.-led coalition on Iraq (refs B and C).  As a matter of 
policy and of Costa Rican constitution law, the GOCR will not 
make contributions to the Iraqi or Afghan Security Forces.
