Sudan has denounced the bombing of the Askariyya Shrine 
in Samarra, Iraq, the Sudan News Agency (SUNA) reported 
on February 25.  "The perpetrators of this heinous 
bombing conspires in order to create sedition among 
Muslims," said Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman 
Jamal Mohammed Ibrahim.  Jamal urged vigilance against 
those who sought to distract the attention of Muslims 
from addressing challenges or repulsing attacks against 
the Islamic world.  He also offered condolences to the 
government of the "Sisterly Republic of Iraq," and 
expressed hope that Muslims would maintain their unity 
and solidarity despite this "accident."
