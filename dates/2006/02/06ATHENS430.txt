¶1.  (C)  Greece has contributed and transported to the Iraqi 
armed forces significant amounts of equipment from the NTECG 
inventory of hardware needed.  In 2005, Greece donated 36 
extensively refurbished BMP-1 armored personnel carriers, 
1000 AK-47s, and more than one million rounds of ammunition 
to the Iraqi military.  It delivered this equipment, along 
with the Hungarian contribution of 72 T-77 tanks, in time to 
be used to provide security during the December 15 elections 
in Iraq.  The Iraqi Defense Attache in Athens told DAO that 
this equipment was very welcome.  The AK-47s in particular, 
he said, filled a critical need at a critical time.  The 
BMPs, he said, were quickly integrated into the 9th Iraqi 
Infantry Division commanded by Major General Bashir, who 
complemented the Greeks on providing equipment in such 
excellent condition. 
 
¶2.  (C)  In 2006, Greece plans to recondition and donate 
another 64 BMP-1s and has also offered 4 pallets of BMP main 
gun ammunition.  Ultimately, the government has pledged to 
contribute to Iraq its entire inventory of 500 BMPs (less any 
that cannot be brought up to acceptable working condition). 
To our knowledge, no transportation arrangements have been 
made for these follow-on donations.  In conversations with 
embassy officials and DOS visitors, MOD officials have 
emphasized that Greece's announced contribution of equipment 
did not include the cost of delivering to Iraq.  In January, 
however, CHOD Chinofotis told the DATT that FM Molyviatis 
vetoed a plan to transport the next tranche of BMPs on a 
Danish ship carrying heavy trucks, insisting that a 
Greek-flagged vessel transport the Greek vehicles.  This 
issue is far from settled, but we will encourage this 
willingness to shoulder the burden. 
 
¶3.  (C)  Post will continue to deliver to senior Greek 
government officials the message contained in reftel, and the 
ongoing visit to Washington by a delegation of senior Greek 
officials responsible for NATO affairs offers an 
excellent opportunity to drive this point home.  Concerning 
Iraq, in particular, we will make the case that the political 
process there, most importantly the democratic election of a 
sovereign government, demands a commensurate change in 
Greece's engagement.  We will urge the government here to 
once again review the NTECG list, to see what additional 
critical Iraqi needs it can meet.
