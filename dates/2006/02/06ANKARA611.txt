¶1.      Summary:   EXBS Advisor continued to promote action 
on the several projects (Internal Control Project (ICP), 
Product Identification Tool (PIT) and Commodity 
Identification Training (CIT)) that have begun in Turkey 
without a ratified NP Cooperation Agreement.  Proposed 
schedules of activities were coordinated to keep the projects 
on target and moving forward.  EXBS Advisor coordinated 
information flow between Turkey and the United States 
concerning PSI activities and participation in upcoming 
Turkish led exercise.  Finally, EXBS Advisor delivered U.S. 
approval for change to NP Agreement title, sought by the 
Turkish Parliament prior to ratification. End Summary. 
 
¶2.      Completed Actions for the Reporting Period 
 
¶A.        Site Assessment and Meetings During Recent 
Reporting Period 
 
1)          January 5- EXBS Advisor met with Department Head 
for Export Controls, General Directorate of Customs Sevilay 
Turksen to review CIT and PIT projects.   Turksen informed 
EXBS Advisor that Customs has been reviewing the PIT project 
and considering conducting the customization in-house, due to 
concerns about specific customs procedures that will be 
included in the program.  EXBS Advisor suggested that an 
outside contractor be utilized for the general customization 
and that the specific customs procedure information be added 
to the program after general customization  This would 
decrease the work that would need to be performed by the 
Turkish Customs IT personnel and should decrease the time 
that it would take for customization.  Turksen stated that 
this option would need to be presented to the proper 
authorities for consideration. 
 
2)          January 6- EXBS Advisor met with MFA Second 
Secretary for Arms Control and Disarmament Serhan Ali Yigit 
 
SIPDIS 
to conduct monthly update meeting on all current projects in 
progress in Turkey, including Internal Control Program (ICP), 
Commodity Identification Training (CIT), Product 
Identification Tool (PIT) and Second Line of Defense (SLD). 
EXBS Advisor also discussed the upcoming Turkey-led PSI 
exercise, including the involvement of other countries and 
the United States' participation in the exercise. 
 
3)          January 20- EXBS Advisor met with MFA Second 
Secretary for Arms Control and Disarmament Serhan Ali Yigit. 
 
SIPDIS 
EXBS Advisor proposed a change in the English language title 
of the NP Agreement that would better match the proposed 
Turkish title while still keeping the intent and focus of the 
agreement.  Yigit did not believe that there would be any 
problems with the proposal.  Yigit also provided an update on 
Turkey's involvement in PSI and the replies to the upcoming 
Turkish led PSI exercise. 
 
4)           January 27- EXBS Advisor met with MFA First 
Secretary for Arms Control and Disarmament Guven Begec. EXBS 
 
SIPDIS 
Advisor proposed a visit by ICP and PIT project coordinator 
in early Feb.  This one day visit would focus on answering 
any final questions along with meeting with the contractor to 
being work on the customization of both projects.  Begec 
agreed that this would be a good opportunity, that should 
allow the projects to finally move forward. 
 
EXBS Advisor met the same day with Serhan Yigit to receive an 
update on the PSI exercise.  Yigit requested EXBS Advisor 
seek an opinion from Washington on the possible addition of 
countries to observe the exercise.  The intent of allowing 
these countries to observe the exercise is to expose them to 
the benefits of PSI in hopes that they will formally endorse 
the initiative.
