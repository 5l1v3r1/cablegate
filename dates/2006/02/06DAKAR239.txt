SUMMARY 
------- 
¶1.  (U) President Joao Bernardo &Nino8 Viera,s government 
has finally presented its program to the National Assembly, 
which effectively has until early March to approve or 
disapprove it.  The Supreme Court ruled in Vieira,s favor on 
the appointment of Prime Minister Aristides Gomes, which a 
faction of his own PAIGC continues to denounce as 
unconstitutional.  Civil society is focused on an array of 
rights and development issues and relies heavily on foreign 
assistance.  Meanwhile, the issue of drugs and security 
sector reform are taking center stage.  During his first 
visit to Bissau, PolOff emphasized the need for compromise to 
end the political standoff and the need for security sector 
reform.  END SUMMARY. 
 
FIFTEEN DAYS OF WAITING ... 
--------------------------- 
¶2.  (C) In an important victory for President Vieira, the 
Supreme Court ruled that his dismissal of Prime Minister and 
political rival Carlos Domingos Gomes Junior was not 
unconstitutional.  His selection of Aristides Gomes for the 
post will stand despite complaints from the divided African 
Party for the Independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde 
(PAIGC).  The next big test for his government is the 
National Popular Assembly,s (ANP,s) vote on the government 
program, which was presented January 31.  The Assembly, which 
is currently in session, has 15 days to approve or return the 
budget for changes.  If changes are requested, the process 
repeats itself and if not approved the second time, the ANP 
must dissolve, and the Government must call new elections. 
Assembly Vice President Mamadu Iaia Djalo, who ran against 
Vieira in the presidential election and is in the PAIGC 
faction that does not support him, told us the program 
probably would be approved.  He continued, though, to grouse 
that constitutional order was not followed in the appointment 
of the Prime Minister. 
 
¶3.  (C) Issues consistently raised by GOGB officials and the 
diplomatic corps included pleas for the United States to 
re-open its embassy; growing concern over narcotics 
trafficking from Colombia through Guinea-Bissau en route to 
Europe; and the primacy of security sector reform in the 
government,s agenda.  On instituting a permanent U.S. 
presence in country, the widely-held opinion is that no donor 
country will take Guinea-Bissau seriously until the Americans 
do.  The Brazilian Charge declared, &This is as stable as it 
gets.8 
 
... AS CIVIL SOCIETY SOLDIERS ON 
-------------------------------- 
¶4.  (U) Poloff visited several recipients of U.S. foreign 
assistance, including two former Special Self-Help Fund 
projects (an orphanage and a school), a current Democracy and 
Human Rights Fund recipient that is bolstering civil legal 
procedures, and HIV/AIDS projects with Sant, Egidio and the 
Guinea-Bissau Social Marketing Association (AGMS), which are 
both funded by USAID,s West Africa Regional Program.  The 
impact of these projects, some of which also receive European 
funding, is impressive.  Structures built with U.S. 
assistance stand out as a few shining beacons of progress 
amid the dust and dead cars that define Bissau,s landscape. 
Project leaders and other civil society members with whom 
Poloff met are concerned about women,s rights and political 
participation, trafficking of children for forced begging, 
and providing basic health care and education, especially in 
remote regions of the country that have little or no access 
to either. 
 
COMMENT

DAKAR 00000239  002 OF 002 
 
 
¶5.  (SBU) If the government,s program is approved by the 
National Assembly, there is hope for at least several more 
months of stability, which could pave the way for some 
political detente.  President Vieira is wisely highlighting 
security sector reform in his agenda and getting buy-in from 
the military.  His government has requested U.S. assistance 
on counternarcotics (Ref A) and staged a crack-down on 
organized crime, arresting hundreds in the city of Gabu near 
the Guinean border at the end of January.  END COMMENT.
