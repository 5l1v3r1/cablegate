CANDIDATE 
 
REF: STATE 16996 
 
We delivered reftel talking points and biography of William 
Voss on February 3 to Transportation Minister Mohammad 
Safadi, Director General for Aviation at the Ministry of 
Transportation Hamdi Chaouk, and Head of the Americas Desk at 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) Ghady El-Khoury. 
Chaouk told us that he personally believes that the ICAO 
needs to change.  He said he is favorably impressed with 
Voss, but it would be difficult to ask Arab League members 
not to vote for Taieb Cherif.  Chaouk said that he would be 
in Abu Dhabi this week for the ICAO Security Conference, and 
he will discuss Voss's candidacy with the Director Generals 
of Civil Aviation from other Arab countries.  He told us that 
he would follow-up with the Embassy when he returns on 
February 13.  El-Khoury told us that he would forward the 
talking points and biography to the appropriate person in the 
department of International Organizations at the MFA.  He 
said that he did not want to comment directly on Voss's 
candidacy because he did not understand all the 
technicalities of civil aviation issues, but he did tell us 
that "it would be difficult" to vote against an Arab League 
consensus candidate.  Safadi's Advisor Antoine Constantine 
told us that the Minister would study the issue and get back 
to us.
