as the consequent cycle of violence, and it (the GOS) regrets 
the loss of human lives and of Iraq's historical artistic 
patrimony. 
 
The Spanish Government expresses its full support and 
solidarity with Iraq's authorities and people, and reiterates

sow death and pain, obstructing the possibilities of peace in 
Iraq.
