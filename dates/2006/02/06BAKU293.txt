¶1.  (U) Per reftel, PAO and Pol/Econ Chief separately shared 
texts of statements by President Bush and Ambassador 
Khalilzad regarding the destruction of the Al-Askariya shrine 
with Azerbaijani MFA Spokesperson and Americas Desk on 
February 23.  MFA Spokesperson Tahir Tagizade subsequently 
issued a statement on the incident to two Azerbaijani 
newspapers on February 24.  An unofficial embassy translation 
of the statement follows: 
 
The Government of Azerbaijan strongly condemns the attack on 
the Al-Askariya shrine and all forms of terror.  As a country 
with a tradition in which Shi'a and Sunni Muslims live 
together, we call on the international community to support 
the democratic development of a unified Iraq.  As a coalition 
partner working to ensure the peace and stability of Iraq, we 
oppose actions that destabilize Iraq and condemn efforts to 
create divisions among the Iraqi people.  We call on all 
Iraqis to be calm and patient. 
 
¶2.  (U) Separately, the Caucasus Muslim Board on February 23 
issued a statement condemning the attack on the shrine. 
"Only Islam's enemies, who try to aggravate the conflict 
between different sects in Islam, could be happy with this 
act.  This crime does not have any relation to religion and 
is political in nature."  In the statement, the Board also 
worried that the attack on the shrine may have serious 
consequences and lead to more serious tragedies.  The Board 
called on Muslims "not to be instruments at the hands of 
Islam's enemies, and not to allow ethnic separatism, but 
rather jointly withstand these challenges." 
 
¶3.  (U) Azerbaijani religious activist and leader of the 
unofficial Juma Mosque Ilgar Ibrahimoglu also issued a 
statement February 23 condemning the attack on the 
Al-Askariya shrine.  Characterizing the attack as "an act of 
barbarism and vandalism," Ibrahimoglu said the crime had 
shocked all believers.  He offered condolences on behalf of 
the Juma Mosque community and said "believers pray that Allah 
will grant peace to Iraqi land, strengthen the national 
government of Iraq, withdraw foreign troops from the country 
as soon as possible and strictly punish those who stir up 
hostility between religions." 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Comment:  The destruction of one of the Shi'a 
community's most revered sites has had surprisingly little 
resonance in this largely secular Shi'a nation.  News 
coverage over the last few days has focused instead on the 
February 21-22 visit of Russian President Putin and the 
February 23 collapse of a market roof in Moscow that killed a 
number of Azerbaijanis. End comment.
