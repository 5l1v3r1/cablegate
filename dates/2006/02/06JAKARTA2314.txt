¶1.  (SBU) UNHCR/Jakarta informed us February 21 that it plans 
to assist Ramon Ballesteros Escobar, a Cuban citizen, with 
refugee assistance after he illegally crossed into Indonesia 
from East Timor earlier this month.  Immigration authorities 
are holding Escobar at an Immigration detention facility in 
Kupang, West Timor.  According to the press, Escobar refused 
return to East Timor or to Cuba and instead requested 
"deportation" to the United States.  Shinji Kubo, head of 
Protective Services at UNCHR in Jakarta, told us that the 
Indonesian Immigration Department has an internal directive 
to refer all asylum cases to UNHCR.  Immigration has already 
made arrangements for UNHCR to visit Escobar and a UNHCR 
staff member is enroute to Kupang to see him.  Kubo said that 
the only complication was Escobar's request for direct US 
Embassy assistance.  We told Kubo that should Escobar contact 
us, we would refer him to UNHCR per our normal procedure. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Kubo said that based on Indonesia's record in 
recent years, he is confident that Indonesia will not 
forcibly remove Escobar or deport him until UNHCR completes 
its report.  Kubo assured us that he would contact the 
Embassy should he suspect that the GOI will forcibly remove 
Escobar.  A Foreign Ministry official in the Directorate of 
East Asian and Pacific Affairs told us February 21 that the 
Indonesian government has no official position on Escobar's 
case at this time.  We will continue to follow this case 
through our contacts at UNHCR and the Foreign Ministry.
