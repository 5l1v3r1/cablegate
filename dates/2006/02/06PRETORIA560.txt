REF: A. STATE 14175 B. DAKAR 264 (NOTAL) 
 
 ¶1. (SBU)  Per Ref A, Post delivered January 31 demarche 
talking points in support of U.S. Candidate for ICAO 
Secretary General William Voss to the South Africa Department 
 
SIPDIS 
of Transport (DOT).  DOT Deputy Director General for 
Transport Regulation and Public Entity Oversight, Ms. 
Nonkululeko Msomi, said that she was not aware of Mr. Voss' 
candidacy.  Although not the official position of the South 
African government, she said it is most likely that South 
Africa will support the candidacy of incumbent Secretary 
General Dr. Taieb Cherif.  Ms. Msomi stated that this 
position was being taken to show support for the African 
Union which would vote as a block.  She then made an 
unsolicited comment that she had heard very good things about 
Mr. Voss and the work he is doing with ICAO.  She corrected 
herself and said that actually she heard Mr. Voss is doing 
"exceptional" work with ICAO.  Ms. Msomi stated that she 
would seek the official position regarding the support of the 
U.S. candidate from the Minister of Transport.  Post will 
follow up with Ms. Msomi, who is currently unavailable due to 
travel. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Post also delivered January 30 demarche points to 
the South African Department of Foreign Affair (DFA) Deputy 
Director of Multilateral Affairs.  Post is following up with 
DFA to solicit a response. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Per ref B, Post has requested appointments for FAA 
Senior Representative Edward Jones to meet with the Minister 
of Transport and with the Department of Foreign Affairs to 
present additional points in support of Mr. Voss' candidacy.
