¶1. On February 6, Econoff delivered ref A points and statement to 
Igor Ugorich of the MFA's Department of International Security and 
Arms Control.  Ugorich received the information without comment. 
Econoff stressed that, given recent statements of intent for 
Belarus and Iran to cooperate on nuclear issues (ref B), it would 
be helpful for the GOB to provide its position on this issue. 
Ugorich promised to pass the request to his superiors. 
 
¶2. On February 3, Belarus' MFA announced, "The official position of 
the Republic of Belarus stems from the fact that any member state 
of the Non-proliferation treaty has the inalienable right to carry 
out peaceful nuclear activities. Belarus traditionally supports the 
IAEA and its Director General's efforts to settle the remaining 
issues in connection with the Iranian nuclear program. 
Belarus urges all interested parties to fully cooperate with IAEA 
on the basis of transparency and good will to solve all remaining 
problems exclusively within the Agency framework."
