SUBJECT: BABIL OFFICIALS TELL DAS GODEC THEY LIKE PRT AND PRDC BUT 
RECONSTRUCTION TOO SLOW 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED - NOT FOR INTERNET DISTRIBUTION 
 
¶1.  (U) This is a Babil PRT cable. 
 
¶2.  (U) SUMMARY: Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near 
Eastern Affairs Robert Godec met with Babil province officials 
to discuss the Babil Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) and 
the Iraqi-run Provincial Reconstruction Development Committee 
(PRDC).  The discussion was cordial but the Provincial Council 
Chairman stressed the need to show tangible results in 
reconstruction sooner rather than later.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  (U) During a visit to Regional Embassy Office (REO) Al 
Hillah on February 4, DAS Godec met with senior members of the 
Babil PRT and the Iraqi representatives of the PRDC.  PRT 
members briefed him on the PRT's structure, interaction with the 
local government, their direction, goals, and needs.  PRDC 
members - Deputy Governor Hasoon Ali Hasoon, Provincial Council 
Chairman (PCC) Muhammed Ali Hussein, and Hillah Mayor Imad Lefta 
Merdan Al-Bayati - met with DAS Godec to discuss the interaction 
between the PRT and the PRDC. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The PCC characterized the PRT-PRDC relationship as a 
full partnership.  He said he appreciated the cooperation 
between the U.S. members of the PRT and the Iraqi 
representatives of the PRDC in all phases of reconstruction 
projects, and praised the Americans for their generosity in 
supporting Iraqi reconstruction.  However, the PCC did note some 
problems with the quality of past projects and cooperation with 
other coalition partners.  While discussing the PRT, the Deputy 
Governor explained that there is impatience with reconstruction 
projects among the Iraqi public.  He stated that he felt like 
"all we do is wait."  The Deputy Governor also noted that with 
the provincial elections approaching, local officials cannot 
show any tangible results in reconstruction.  The PCC and the 
Hillah Mayor echoed the Deputy Governor's comments. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) After the PCC and Deputy Governor complained that the 
quality of some projects would reflect badly on the U.S. and the 
U.S.-Iraqi partnership, DAS Godec noted that the PRDC is a 
mechanism for bringing Iraqi influence to bear on the quality of 
work done in these projects.  The Iraqis commented on the poor 
quality of the Polish and El Salvadoran projects.  Specifically, 
the PCC, Deputy Governor, and the Mayor noted seven water 
projects that, although recently completed, did not function. 
Although no details of the problems were offered, the PRT will 
follow up with the PRDC on this.  (NOTE: For at least six months 
the Coalition Forces staff in Babil has been pressing Iraqi 
officials to make project site visits to address some of their 
concerns over quality, but the officials have yet to do so. END 
NOTE.) 
 
¶6.  (SBU) COMMENT: Although the meeting was cordial, the message 
from Iraqi officials was that Iraqis are impatient with the slow 
pace of reconstruction.  The Deputy Governor's comment -- which 
the PCC and Hillah Mayor reaffirmed -- that provincial officials 
cannot demonstrate progress on reconstruction come election time 
indicates the importance officials and voters place on the 
issue. There also appeared to be a subtle but noticeable change 
in the relative roles of the Deputy Governor and the Provincial 
Council Chairman in the meeting.  In the past the Deputy 
Governor would have taken a prominent role in the discussions. 
During this meeting, the Provincial Council Chairman took the 
lead, calling on the Deputy Governor to speak only after he was 
finished.  In doing so, he referred to him as "a citizen of 
Babil Province," not as the Deputy Governor.  This would not 
have happened six months ago and may reflect the growing stature 
and assertiveness of Provincial Council members relative to the 
Governor and Deputy Governor.  END COMMENT.
