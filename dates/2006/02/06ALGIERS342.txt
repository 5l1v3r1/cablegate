POLISARIO "AMBASSADOR" POSITIVE ABOUT U.S. 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶1. According to Algerian press reports confirmed by Embassy 
Rabat (reftels), the Polisario peacefully marked February 27 
the 30th anniversary of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic 
(SADR).  Unlike May 2005 statements from Polisario leader 
Abdelaziz and President Bouteflika, the statements this year 
avoided provocative language about the "right to 
self-determination and independence." 
 
¶2. In an interview before the anniversary with 
Arabic-language daily newspaper Ech-Chorouk El Youmi that 
appeared in print February 27, Polisario Ambassador to 
Algeria Beissat praised the U.S. for sending NEA/MAG Director 
William Jordan to see the conditions in the Tindouf camps 
first-hand following recent floods.  While acknowledging the 
humanitarian support of several nations and organizations 
after the floods, Beissat singled out for praise the $50,000 
U.S. contribution to the World Food Program. 
 
ALGERIA SUPPORTS SELF-DETERMINATION 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶3. In a written message to Polisario leader Abdelaziz on the 
occasion of the SADR's 30th anniversary, President Bouteflika 
affirmed that his country would continue to support the 
Sahrawi people.  "As a country bordering the two parties to 
the conflict (Morocco and the Polisario Algeria will continue 
to assume its responsibilities" so that a settlement in 
accordance with international law can be reached that 
protects the right of self-determination for the people of 
the Western Sahara.  Bouteflika added that this was the "last 
problem of its kind on the African continent," a reference to 
decolonization. 
 
POLISARIO LEADER MAKES NO MENTION OF INDEPENDENCE 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶4. Polisario leader Abdelaziz also notably avoided any 
mention of independence in his February 27 speech on the 30th 
anniversary, but firmly rejected "the Moroccan autonomy plan" 
for the Western Sahara as contrary to the UN Charter and 
Security Council resolutions and as a "new maneuver" to 
impose a colonial solution.  This Moroccan plan, he warned, 
would ineluctably lead the region toward a "dangerous 
skidding out of control" (derapage).  Noting the Polisario's 
acceptance of the Baker Plan, he affirmed that the principle 
of self-determination for the Sahrawi people was sacred and 
declared that "any solution to the conflict of the Western 
Sahara must respect the Sahrawis' ... right to 
self-determination."  He also called on the international 
community to encourage Morocco to put an end to the "looting 
and sale" of the Sahrawis' natural resources.  Abdelaziz paid 
tribute to "the Sahrawi resistance in the territories under 
Moroccan occupation and to the courageous and historical 
position of Algeria and its unfailing support for the 
decolonization process, as well as the role of Africa in the 
defense of the Sahrawi cause."
