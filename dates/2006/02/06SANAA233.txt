SUBJECT: ARMED FORCES CHIEF REQUESTS ACCESS TO BETHESDA 
NAVAL HOSPITAL 
 
REF: 2005 SANAA 1868 
 
On January 18, MG Mohammed Ali Al-Qassimi, Chief of Staff for 
the Armed Forces, requested post's assistance to schedule a 
required medical check-up at Bethesda Naval Hospital. 
Qassimi recently returned to Yemen after six months of cancer 
treatment at Bethesda (ref A).  The Republic of Yemen 
Government will pay all related costs.  Post requests 
Department assistance in arranging a follow-up appointment on 
March 8.  Yemen is a key partner in the GWOT and allowing 
Qassimi to continue treatment at Bethesda will contribute 
positively to our bi-lateral relationship.
