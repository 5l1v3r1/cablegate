SUBJECT: US-CAPTURED SOMALI PIRATES' TRIAL CONFIRMED 
 
REF: NAIROBI 526 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The trial of 10 Somali pirates (reftel) began 
February 8 in Mombasa, as scheduled, with lawyers for the 
suspects arguing that the Kenyan judicial system did not have 
the authority to try the men.  In a February 9 ruling, 
however, the presiding magistrate ruled in favor of the 
prosecution's argument that as a party to the UN Convention 
on the Law of the Sea, Kenya has the right to prosecute. 
Declining to acquit the Somalis, the magistrate affirmed that 
the trial will take place and is scheduled to commence 
February 14.  Four of the Indian seamen are expected to be 
called as witnesses early in the proceedings. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The pirates have retained five lawyers to represent 
them in court, although the circumstances under which they 
were hired are unclear.  One official close to the case 
suggested that, given the strength of Somali clan ties, the 
pirates may be supported by clansmen resident in the Mombasa 
area.  Indicative of the high-level at which this case is 
being handled in the Kenyan Government, the prosecution is 
being directed from the Attorney General's office in Nairobi 
with the Assistant Deputy Public Prosecutor taking the lead.
