INVESTMENT ACT PROVISIONS ON RAW SUGAR TARIFF RATE QUOTA: 
NICARAGUA WILL SHIP ITS 2005/2006 SUGAR QUOTA 
 
REF: SECSTATE 14374 
 
 ¶1.  (U)  Embassy contacted Jose de Jesus Bermudez, Director 
of Treaty Implementation in the Ministry of Development, 
Industry and Trade (MIFIC), who is the official responsible 
for signing the CQE's, to request a written response to 
reftel questions.  Bermudez responded by email that he had 
been in touch with Mario Amador of the National Sugar 
Producers Committee (CNPA), who explained that the sugar 
producers to whom the quota had been allocated were in 
negotiations with potential purchasers to ship the remaining 
889.27 short tons before September of this year, and assured 
us that Nicaragua will be exporting the totality of its 
assigned quota, as well as the entire additional quota 
equivalent to 6,135.67 short tons during the time limit. 
Embassy forwarded the Bermudez communication EB/TPP/ABT/ATP. 
We also spoke to staff of the CNPA, who assured us that they 
will use the entire remaining quota this year. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Bermudez subsequently faxed Econ Counselor a letter 
dated February 1 which reiterated Nicaragua's commitment to 
ship the entire quota and provided further details of 
upcoming shipments and the allocation of the additional 
quota.  We have faxed the letter and allocation sheet to 
USDA/FAS in Washington.  Informal Embassy translation follows: 
 
¶3.  (U) Begin text: 
"I refer to the U.S. sugar quota allocation for the period 
2005-2006, including additional allocation. 
 
With reference to the remaining quota for the 2005-2006 
period, equivalent to 889.27 short tons, I inform you that 
the beneficiary mills now have the embarcations ready in the 
port of Corinto for export to the United States. 
 
In relation to the additional TRQ of 6,135.67 short tons, I 
also confirm that they will be utilized in their entirety, 
and I am forwarding you the distribution of the quota among 
the national sugar producers which was sent to this office by 
the National Sugar Producers Committee (CNPA).  We will 
shortly send you the information required for issuance of the 
CQEs. 
 
We reiterate the capacity of the National Sugar Industry to 
fill any additional quota which may be assigned to Nicaragua 
as a country. 
 
Signed, 
Jesus Bermudez 
Director, Treaty Application. 
Ministry of Development, Industry and Trade"
