¶1. (C) On February 13, poloff delivered the talking points in 
reftel to Miriam Fonseca, Director of the Foreign Ministry's 
Middle East, Africa and Asia section.  Fonseca was 
sympathetic to the USG concerns, and said that the GON, like 
everyone else, is waiting to see what sort of Palestinian 
Authority government will be formed in the aftermath of the 
recent elections.  Fonseca noted that Hamas had been 
surprised by the extent of its victory, and will now have to 
make unanticipated adjustments to the responsibilities of 
government.  Fonseca will discuss the USG points with Foreign 
Minister Caldera and decide how the GON can best make its 
views known on the issue. 
 
¶2. (C) Noting that Nicaragua enjoys forma|d.ZQ, and 
highlight international concerns regarding the policies of 
the new Palestinian Authority government.  Fonseca noted that 
Mauqqat has only been in his post in Managua for a month, but 
that he already seems a much more refined, pragmatic 
individual than his predecessor, who had a reputation for 
dogmatism and intransigence.  Because Mauqqat is al Fatah, he 
may not last long in Managua, depending on how important 
Nicaragua is to the Palestinians.
