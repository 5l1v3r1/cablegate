SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.   (SBU) DRIVEN BY LOCAL UNEMPLOYMENT AND POVERTY, 
THOUSANDS OF TURKMENISTAN'S CITIZENS TRAVEL TO TURKEY TO 
WORK ILLEGALLY AS UNSKILLED LABORERS.  ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE 
COLLECTED FROM LABOR MIGRANTS SUGGESTS THAT, HAVING 
ARRIVED IN TURKEY, MOST MIGRANTS OVERSTAY THEIR TOURIST 
VISAS TO EARN INCOMES ROUGHLY TEN TIMES GREATER THAN 
THOSE AVAILABLE AT HOME.  OTHERS HAVE FALLEN INTO 
TRAFFICKING TRAPS SET FOR THEM BY THEIR OWN COUNTRYMEN. 
MIGRANT WORKERS' ILLEGAL STATUS, A LACK OF LOCAL 
CONNECTIONS, AND MISPLACED TRUST IN THEIR FELLOW 
COUNTRYMEN MAKE NEW ARRIVALS IN TURKEY SUSCEPTIBLE FOR 
EXPLOITATION BY THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT.  LABOR MIGRANTS 
REPORT THAT THE GOTX HAS RECOGNIZED THE SERIOUSNESS OF 
TURKMENISTANI CRIME IN TURKEY AND IS NOW TRYING TO FIGHT 
IT IN COOPERATION WITH TURKISH AUTHORITIES, ALTHOUGH THE 
GOTX HAS MADE NO OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENTS REGARDING THIS 
EFFORT.  THE GOTX ALSO ATTEMPTS TO LIMIT TRAVEL TO TURKEY 
THROUGH VARIOUS UNOFFICIAL EXIT REGULATIONS, BUT THE GOTX 
IS UNLIKELY TO STOP LABOR MIGRATION UNTIL IT ADDRESSES 
THE POOR EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND LIVING STANDARDS 
THAT CAUSE IT.  ADMITTING PROBLEMS, HOWEVER, IS 
POLITICALLY UNACCEPTABLE IN TURKMENISTAN, AND POSSIBLY 
CAREER-ENDING.  END SUMMARY. 
 
TURKEY - A PRIME DESTINATION 
----------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) TURKEY CONTINUES TO BE THE DESTINATION OF CHOICE 
FOR TURKMENISTANI MIGRANTS BECAUSE OF LOW AIRFARE ($135 
ROUNDTRIP), A SIMPLIFIED VISA REGIME, HIGH LABOR DEMAND 
IN ISTANBUL, AND CHEAP GOODS.  IN THE LAST FEW YEARS, 
WIDESPREAD UNEMPLOYMENT AND DETERIORATING SOCIAL 
CONDITIONS IN TURKMENISTAN'S TOWNS AND VILLAGES HAVE 
CONTRIBUTED TO THE MIGRATION OF THOUSANDS OF 
TURKMENISTAN'S CITIZENS TO TURKEY TO FIND BETTER-PAYING 
JOBS.  OTHER JOBLESS TURKMENISTANIS HAVE BECOME "PRIVATE 
ENTREPRENEURS" WHO TRAVEL TO TURKEY TO BUY TURKISH GOODS 
AND RESELL THEM IN TURKMENISTAN'S MARKETS.  A POLICE 
OFFICER FROM THE LEBAP PROVINCE ADMINISTRATIVE CENTER 
TURKMENABAT TOLD POLASST'S RELATIVES THAT OVER 11,000 
CITY RESIDENTS HAD LEFT THE CITY TO LOOK FOR JOBS ABROAD. 
 
 
FINDING JOBS THROUGH "SIRKETS" 
------------------------------- 
 
¶4.   (SBU) POLASST TRAVELED TO ISTANBUL MARCH 23-26 AND 
OBTAINED A RELIABLE PICTURE OF THE CITY'S TURKMENISTANI 
LABOR MARKET THROUGH RELATIVES WORKING THERE.  LABOR 
MIGRANTS FROM TURKMENISTAN PRIMARILY FIND JOBS THROUGH SO 
CALLED "SIRKETS" (TURKISH FOR COMPANY) -- EMPLOYMENT 
AGENCIES THAT MATCH JOB-SEEKERS WITH FAMILIES LOOKING FOR 
A HOUSEMAID OR WITH TEXTILE FACTORIES AND OTHER 
ENTERPRISES NEEDING UNSKILLED WORKERS.  RELATIVES OR 
ACQUAINTANCES USUALLY MEET LABOR MIGRANTS AT THE AIRPORT 
AND INTRODUCE THEM TO A SIRKET.  THE SIRKET PROVIDES 
CLIENTS WITH LODGING DURING THE JOB SEARCH PERIOD AND 
CHARGES A FEE FOR ITS SERVICES BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF 
THE JOB SEEKER'S FIRST MONTH'S PAY.  MOST MIGRANTS STAY 
IN ISTANBUL, ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES SIRKETS OFFER JOBS 
OUTSIDE ISTANBUL.  HOUSEMAIDS AND UNSKILLED LABORERS 
GENERALLY FIND JOBS STARTING AT $350-400 PER MONTH AND 
TRY TO MOVE UP TO BETTER-PAYING JOBS ONCE THEY LEARN 
TURKISH.  (NOTE.  IN CONTRAST, THE AVERAGE MONTHLY WAGE 
IN TURKMENISTAN IS $40-60 PER MONTH. END NOTE.) 
ACCORDING TO POLASST'S RELATIVES, THE MAJORITY OF LABOR 
MIGRANTS OVERSTAY THEIR TOURIST VISAS AND BECOME ILLEGAL 
RESIDENTS. 
 
¶5.   (SBU) JOB SEEKERS ARRIVING IN ISTANBUL WITHOUT LOCAL 
CONNECTIONS OFTEN FALL PREY TO TURKMENISTANI MIDDLEMEN, 
WHO MAY HAVE TIES TO SIRKETS OR EMPLOYERS.  NEWCOMERS ARE 
OFTEN HAPPY TO SEE THEIR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN AND GLADLY 
ACCEPT PROPOSALS TO HELP FIND A JOB FOR A USUAL FEE OF 
 
ASHGABAT 00000545  002.3 OF 004 
 
 
$100.  MIDDLEMEN, FOR THEIR FEE, EITHER TAKE THE 
NEWCOMERS TO A SIRKET FOR ADDITIONAL FEE-FOR-SERVICE 
ASSISTANCE, OR MAY HOST THE NEWCOMER THEMSELVES AND TRY 
TO DIRECTLY CONNECT THEM WITH EMPLOYERS. 
 
PROSTITUTION: SEX COMMUTERS 
--------------------------- 
 
¶6.   (SBU) A TURKMENISTANI AIDS SPECIALIST RESEARCHING 
TURKMENISTAN'S SEX INDUSTRY TOLD POLOFF IN FEBRUARY THAT 
SOME OF THE COUNTRY'S PROSTITUTES REGULARLY 'COMMUTE' TO 
TURKEY ON TOURIST VISAS AND DO NOT OVERSTAY THEIR VISAS, 
WHICH ALLOWS FOR THE REPEATED 'LEGAL' TRAVEL.  (NOTE: 
ACCORDING TO THE TURKISH EMBASSY IN ASHGABAT, SINGLE 
TURKMENISTANI WOMEN MAY ONLY ENTER TURKEY AS PERSONAL 
GUESTS OF TURKISH CITIZENS, AND NOT ON TOURIST VISAS. 
DURING VISA INTERVIEWS, HOWEVER, CONOFF HAS REGULARLY 
NOTICED THAT SINGLE TURKMENISTANI WOMEN APPLYING FOR U.S. 
TOURIST VISAS OFTEN HAVE TURKISH TOURIST VISAS IN THEIR 
PASSPORTS.  END NOTE.)  A SEX WORKER'S LABOR CONDITIONS 
AND JOB SEARCH DIFFER FROM THAT OF REGULAR LABOR 
MIGRANTS, AS DOES THEIR WAGE, WHICH IS SEVERAL TIMES 
HIGHER THAN THAT OF REGULAR HOUSEMAIDS.  FRIENDS ALREADY 
WORKING IN THE TURKISH SEX TRADE OR IN THE HOSPITALITY 
INDUSTRY NORMALLY INVITE NEW TURKMENISTANI SEX WORKERS TO 
THE COUNTRY.  ACCORDING TO POLASST'S CONTACTS, YOUNG 
TURKMENISTANI WOMEN WHO COME TO WORK AT NON-SEX JOBS 
SOMETIMES DECIDE TO CHANGE THEIR 'PROFESSION' ONCE IN 
TURKEY TO PROSTITUTION. 
 
TRAFFICKERS OFFER EMPLOYMENT BUT TAKE MUCH MORE 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶7.   (SBU) ACCORDING TO POLASST'S LOCAL CONTACTS, ALONG 
WITH WELL-INTENTIONED RELATIVES AND ACQUAINTANCES AND THE 
ANGLING MIDDLEMEN, MUCH MORE DANGEROUS TURKMENISTANI 
TRAFFICKERS ALSO TROLL FOR NEWCOMERS AT THE ISTANBUL 
AIRPORT.  THE TRAFFICKERS CLAIM GOOD CONTACTS WITH BARS, 
HOTELS, FACTORIES, SIRKETS, AND SOMETIMES EVEN WITH THE 
POLICE, AND THEY LOOK FOR MEN AND WOMEN ALIKE.  USUALLY, 
A TRAFFICKER OFFERS TO HELP A LABOR MIGRANT FIND A JOB 
AND, IN ORDER TO DO SO, REQUESTS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF 
MONEY AND THE MIGRANT'S PASSPORT.  NEWCOMERS USUALLY 
TRUST THEIR COUNTRYMEN AND HAND OVER THEIR DOCUMENTS. 
MEN END UP WORKING IN FACTORIES ONLY QUICKLY TO LEARN 
THEY WON'T BE PAID AND WILL HAVE TO 'WORK-OFF' THEIR 
PASSPORTS TO GET THEM BACK.  ALISHER, 22 YEARS OLD AND 
FROM TURKMENABAT, WAS ONE OF THESE TRAFFICKED WORKERS. 
HE PAID A MIDDLEMAN NAMED REJIK (SEE PARAGRAPH 12) TO GET 
A JOB AT A TEXTILE FACTORY, WHERE HE WORKED FOR TWO 
MONTHS WITHOUT BEING PAID AND WITHOUT GETTING HIS 
PASSPORT RETURNED.  ALISHER FEARED GOING TO 
TURKMENISTAN'S ISTANBUL CONSULATE TO GET A NEW PASSPORT 
BECAUSE HE HAD OVERSTAYED HIS TOURIST VISA AND WASN'T 
SURE THE CONSULATE VISIT WOULD BE OF ANY HELP.  STILL 
WITHOUT HIS PASSPORT BUT FREE FROM REJIK'S TRAP, ALISHER 
NOW WORKS AS A DELIVERY BOY AT AN ISTANBUL RESTAURANT. 
 
¶8. (SBU) THERE IS ALSO EVIDENCE, BOTH ANECDOTAL AND 
ACTUAL, THAT YOUNG WOMEN WHO WILLINGLY AGREE TO 
PROSTITUTION WITH THE HOPES OF EARNING SIGNIFICANT 
INCOMES BECOME VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING.  SOME WOMEN COMING 
TO WORK AT NON-SEX JOBS REPORTEDLY ARE DECEIVED AND 
TRAFFICKED INTO THE SEX BUSINESS.  AS WITH MEN, ONCE IN 
THE TRAP THESE WOMEN ARE NOT PAID AND ARE BLACKMAILED 
INTO 'WORKING-OFF' THEIR PASSPORTS.  MEMBERS OF THE 
TURKMENISTANI COMMUNITY IN ISTANBUL APPEAR AWARE OF THESE 
SCHEMES.  POLASST'S RELATIVES TOLD STORIES OF TRAFFICKED 
TURKMENISTANI PROSTITUTES AND OF A MAN NAMED MURAD FROM 
TURKMENABAT WHO WAS, "INVOLVED IN DIRTY EMPLOYMENT 
DEALINGS IN ISTANBUL."  POLASST'S RELATIVES SAID THEY 
KNEW NOT TO LOOK FOR A JOB THROUGH MURAD, DESPITE HIS 
GOOD CONNECTIONS TO SIRKETS AND POTENTIAL EMPLOYERS, 
BECAUSE HE WAS ALSO KNOWN FOR "FOOLING PEOPLE AND SELLING 
THEM."(NOTE: ACCORDING TO POST'S INFORMATION, ALL OF 
TURKMENISTAN'S REGISTERED TRAFFICKING CASES (UNDER 10 
TOTAL) WERE TRAFFICKED TO TURKEY.  END NOTE.) 
 
TURKMEN LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIVE IN ISTANBUL? 
 
ASHGABAT 00000545  003.3 OF 004 
 
 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶9.   (SBU) SEVERAL OF POLASST'S RELATIVES IN ISTANBUL 
RECOUNTED THE FEBRUARY ARREST OF A LARGE ORGANIZED CRIME 
GROUP COMPRISED MOSTLY OF TURKMENISTANIS FROM 
TURKMENABAT.  LED BY A GANG CHIEF NAMED MUHAMMET (ALSO 
FROM TURKMENABAT), THE GANG'S PRIMARY ACTIVITY WAS 
TRAFFICKING TURKMENISTANI MEN AND WOMEN.  ACCORDING TO 
POLASST'S RELATIVES, TURKISH LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENTS, 
POSSIBLY ASSISTED BY THEIR COUNTERPARTS FROM 
TURKMENISTAN, ARRESTED ABOUT 15 MEMBERS OF THE GANG. 
ALONG WITH GUNS AND DRUGS, THE TURKISH POLICE REPORTEDLY 
CONFISCATED 34 PASSPORTS BELONGING TO TURKMENISTANI 
CITIZENS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN TRAFFICKED BY THE GANG. 
 
¶10.   (SBU) THE TURKMENISTANI LABOR MIGRANTS INTERVIEWED 
BY POLASST IN ISTANBUL BELIEVED TURKMENISTANI LAW 
ENFORCEMENT AGENTS WERE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN 
INVESTIGATIONS, DEPORTATIONS AND PROSECUTIONS OF 
TURKMENISTANI CRIMINALS WANTED IN THEIR HOME COUNTRY, AS 
WELL AS CRIMINAL GROUPS AND PROSTITUTES WORKING IN 
ISTANBUL.  LABOR MIGRANTS CLAIM PLAIN-CLOTHES LAW 
ENFORCEMENT AGENTS FROM TURKMENISTAN WORKED AT THE 
ISTANBUL AIRPORT TO DETECT TRAFFICKERS RECRUITING 
POTENTIAL VICTIMS NEWLY ARRIVED FROM TURKMENISTAN. 
 
¶11.   (SBU) ACCORDING TO ALISHER (SEE PARAGRAPH 7), THIS 
WAS THE METHOD USED BY TURKMENISTANI AGENTS IN EARLY 2006 
FOR DETECTING AND ARRESTING REJIK, THE TRAFFICKER WHO HAD 
TRAFFICKED HIM.  POLASST'S CONTACTS DID NOT KNOW IF REJIK 
WAS PROSECUTED IN TURKEY OR DEPORTED TO TURKMENISTAN FOR 
PROSECUTION. 
 
GOTX ATTEMPTS TO REGULATE LABOR MIGRATION 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶12.  (SBU) THE GOTX HAS TRIED TO PREVENT LABOR MIGRATION 
TO TURKEY WITH UNOFFICIAL REGULATIONS APPARENTLY AIMED AT 
REDUCING TURKMENISTANI CRIME AND PROSTITUTION IN TURKEY. 
THE STATE SERVICE FOR THE REGISTRATION OF FOREIGN 
CITIZENS, ALSO KNOWN AS THE MIGRATION SERVICE, INTRODUCED 
IN 2004 AN UNOFFICIAL REQUIREMENT FOR ALL CITIZENS 
TRAVELING TO TURKEY TO CARRY AT LEAST $500 TO PREVENT 
"YOUNG WOMEN WHO DISHONOR TURKMENISTAN AND WHO MIGHT 
BECOME VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING" FROM TRAVELING (REFTEL). 
WHEN TRAVELING TO ISTANBUL IN MARCH, POLASST HAD TO SHOW 
PROOF OF MEETING THIS UNOFFICIAL REQUIREMENT, SUGGESTING 
IT IS STILL IN FORCE. 
 
¶13.   (SBU) ANOTHER UNPUBLICIZED RULE THAT IS WIDELY 
BELIEVED TO BE IN FORCE, AND WHICH HAS EXISTED FOR 
SEVERAL YEARS, IS THAT WOMEN UNDER THE AGE OF 35 ARE NOT 
ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY WITHOUT PERMISSION FROM 
THEIR PARENT(S).  EVEN WITH PERMISSION, HOWEVER, A YOUNG 
WOMAN'S TRAVEL CAN BE DENIED.  THE MIGRATION SERVICE 
DENIED PERMISSION TO POLASST'S YOUNG FEMALE RELATIVE IN 
DECEMBER 2005 TO TRAVEL TO TURKEY, EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS 
TRAVELING WITH HER MOTHER.  LATER, THE WOMAN MANAGED TO 
TRAVEL TO ISTANBUL VIA IRAN.  ACCORDING TO THE DECEMBER 
2005 MIGRATION LAW, THE GOTX ALSO MAY PREVENT ITS 
CITIZENS FROM TRAVELING ABROAD IF THE GOTX BELIEVES THE 
TRAVELER MAY FALL VICTIM TO TRAFFICKING.  (NOTE: THIS 
PROVISION IS WIDELY VIEWED AS YET ANOTHER MEANS FOR THE 
GOTX TO PREVENT FOREIGN TRAVEL IN GENERAL, AND NOT AS A 
BENEVOLENT WAY TO COMBAT TRAFFICKING.  END NOTE.) 
 
¶14.  (SBU) THE MIGRATION SERVICE REPORTEDLY PUTS CITIZENS 
RETURNING FROM TURKEY WHO HAVE OVERSTAYED THEIR ONE-MONTH 
TOURIST VISA ON A 'BLACK LIST' OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT 
PERMITTED TO TRAVEL TO TURKEY FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD OF 
TIME.  A SIMILAR LIST ALLEGEDLY EXISTS FOR THOSE DEPORTED 
FROM TURKEY, ESPECIALLY THOSE ACCUSED OF WORKING AS 
PROSTITUTES.  FOR THOSE ON THIS LIST THE TRAVEL 
RESTRICTIONS ARE LONGER IN DURATION, AND THE MIGRATION 
SERVICE MAKES A PHOTOGRAPHIC RECORD OF THE OFFENDERS ON 
RETURN AT THE AIRPORT.  THE MIGRATION SERVICE SOMETIMES 
TAKES PROSTITUTES TO A MEDICAL FACILITY FOR HIV/AIDS AND 
SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES EXAMINATIONS.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶15.   (SBU) OBSERVATIONS FROM LABOR MIGRANTS IN ISTANBUL 
SUGGEST THAT TURKMENISTAN'S LAW ENFORCEMENT MAY BE 
COOPERATING WITH TURKISH COUNTERPARTS TO INTERDICT 
TURKMENISTANI CRIMINAL GANGS AND PROSTITUTION IN TURKEY, 
ALTHOUGH THE GOTX PREDICTABLY HAS NOT PUBLICLY 
ACKNOWLEDGED THIS WORK.  ADMITTING THE TABOO OF LABOR 
MIGRATION, LET ALONE THAT OF ITS ATTENDANT DARK SIDE OF 
TIP, CRIME, AND PROSTITUTION, WOULD DETRACT FROM THE 
IMAGE OF TURKMENISTAN AS A PROSPEROUS, UTOPIAN STATE, 
WHICH THE GOTX TRIES HARD TO MANUFACTURE AND PRESERVE. 
 
¶16.  (SBU) TURKMENISTANI LABOR MIGRATION TO TURKEY AND 
ELSEWHERE WILL CONTINUE AND COULD BECOME A SERIOUS SOCIAL 
AND HUMANITARIAN PROBLEM UNLESS JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND 
LIVING STANDARDS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE INSIDE 
TURKMENISTAN.  RESTRICTIVE TRAVEL MEASURES WILL NOT STEM 
THE FLOW OF PEOPLE LOOKING TO IMPROVE THEIR FAMILIES' 
LIVELIHOODS.  MEANWHILE, ACKNOWLEDGING THE PROBLEM AND 
CARRYING OUT A PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN WOULD BE THE 
MOST FITTING REMEDY.  UNFORTUNATELY, THE GOTX DOES NOT 
ADMIT THAT SOCIO-ECONOMIC PROBLEMS EXIST.  A BOLD 
MINISTER WHO RISKS THE DIRECT APPROACH WOULD MOST LIKELY 
EARN A "GO DIRECTLY TO JAIL" CARD FROM THE PRESIDENT. 
END COMMENT.
