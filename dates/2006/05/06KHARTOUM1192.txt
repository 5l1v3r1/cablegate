SUBJECT: CIVIL SOCIETY GROWS IN JUBA 
 
 
¶1. SUMMARY: As one indication of the growing strength of 
civil society in Southern Sudan, the Catholic Archdiocese 
of Juba with the support of the Sudan Council of Churches 
(SCC) and the Life and Peace Institute Horn of Africa, 
organized a workshop for the "Voice of Women for Peace 
and Faith Civil Group Society (VWPFCGS)" in Juba from May 
8-12.  The topics discussed at this peace rally were 
peace building, leadership and teamwork, democracy, the 
comprehensive peace agreement and human rights, and the 
constitution.  The workshop was concluded by a peace 
rally held at Dr. Garang memorial in Juba on May 13.  End 
Summary. 
 
---------- 
Background 
---------- 
 
¶2. The Voice of Women for Peace and Faith (VWPF) is a 
civil society organization dedicated to peace and gender 
equality.  It was formed in October, 2005 following a 
workshop organized by the Sudan Aid Women's Desk Office 
under the auspices of the Catholic Archdiocese of Juba. 
VWPF membership includes representatives from the 
Catholic Church, the Episcopal Church of Sudan, the 
Africa Inland Church, the Presbyterian Church, and Muslim 
women.

Peace Rally 
----------- 
 
¶3. The peace rally following the workshop was the first 
of its kind in Juba since the formation of the Government 
of Southern Sudan (GoSS) in October 2005.  James Wani 
Igga, Speaker of Southern Sudan Legislative Assembly 
(SSLA), Henry Danga, Deputy Governor of Bahr Al Jebel 
State (BJS), and Archbishop Paulino Lokudu Loro of Juba 
spoke at the rally, which was attended by dignitaries, 
officials from the GoSS and BJS, and an audience of about 
200, mostly women.  Scattered in the crowd were banners 
which read "women's call for realization of the 25% of 
government position" (Note: this refers to the CPA 
provision giving 25 percent of government positions to 
qualified women. End Note.), "halt violence against 
women" and "give women a chance," among others. 
 
-------- 
Speeches 
-------- 
 
¶4.  During the speeches, the Deputy Governor of BJS, 
Henry Danga, affirmed his government's commitment to the 
25 percent and said that there are 15 women who would 
soon graduate from their training and begin work as BJS 
officials.  He promised to raise women's participation in 
the state government to 50 percent.

Comment 
------- 
 
¶7.  Civil society groups are becoming more active, and 
getting more firmly established in the nascent southern 
societal structures.  There will most likely be more 
civil society celebrations and gatherings within the 
coming months.  While still celebratory, these 
demonstrations may become more contentious if the 
people's expectations for development are not met.  End 
Comment.
