Government.  These statements were widely covered in the 
Italian press.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U)  On May 20, the Italian MFA expressed satisfaction 
with the formation of the new Iraqi Government.  The GOI 
statement noted that the formation of the government was an 
important step toward stabilization, reconstruction and 
democratization of the country.  The statement reiterated 
Italy's commitment to provide support, along with "principal 
international partners", for the continuing reconstruction 
and democractic development of Iraq. 
 
¶3. (U)  Newly-elected PM Romano Prodi issued a message to 
Iraqi PM Al Maliki stating, "In the name of the Italian 
Government and me personally, I send you the sincerest 
congratulations for the formation of the new government.  The 
choice for reconciliation under the mark of inclusivity of 
all the most representative elements of the country is an 
important premise in the difficult path to rebuilding a 
democratic Iraq.  Italy will support Iraq in this." 
 
¶4. (U)  Newly-appointed FM Massimo D'Alema sent a 
congratulatory note to Iraqi FM Hoshiyar Zebari stating that 
the new Iraqi Government "is a source of hope for the 
pacification, reconstruction and democratization process for 
your country, so that the spirit of reconciliation and 
national unity between all political, religious and ethnic 
groups can prevail."
