Out of All the Cities in All the World...

¶1.  (U) On Monday afternoon, May 22, 2006, hundreds of 
Moroccan children returned home from school with a dire 
prediction that a giant tsunami would strike Casablanca in a 
mere three days.  Some schools threatened closures and word 
of the disaster washed over the city sending people 
scurrying to find more information and seek higher ground. 
A few wealthy, educated expats fled their palatial homes by 
the sea to find refugee in the high-rise dwellings of 
friends well above the predicted level of destruction.  Less 
fortunate Moroccans, meanwhile, could be found heading to 
mosques to pray for protection against the storm, images of 
Indian Ocean tsunami still fresh in their minds.  Moroccan 
National Press reported some Moroccans were packed and ready 
to head to the mountains or even travel to other countries. 
Consulate Casablanca's Consular Section received numerous 
emails and phone calls requesting information on the 
impending doom as well.

He Had to Blog Into Mine...

¶2.  (U) The tsunami prediction originated with French author 
and UFO "kidnapping victim" Eric Julien, director of the 
Ufological Research Center. Julian claimed he had received 
information psychically that a comet fragment would crash 
into the Atlantic Ocean on May 25, 2006, and cause a giant 
tsunami.  He asserted that the waves would be up to 200 
 
SIPDIS 
meters high and impact all countries bordering the Atlantic. 
In Morocco, Julien's forcast was taken so seriously that the 
head of the Moroccan Meteorological office, Mustapha Janah 
made an official statement to the Moroccan press denying the 
possibility of the tsunami and quoting "NASA" officials who 
noted that the comet in question would be approximately ten 
million kilometers away when it passed the earth.

Maybe not Today, Maybe not Tomorrow...

¶3.  (U) Why did the rumor spread so quickly and why was it 
taken so seriously?  According to some Moroccans, the answer 
may be twofold.  First, Morocco is a land of oral history 
where word of mouth has been the preferred method of 
communicating news for generations.  With literacy rates 
hovering around fifty percent, gossip is a more common 
method of disseminating information than the newspapers. 
Second, for the very religious of Casablanca the idea that a 
giant wave would sweep through the city and wash it "clean 
of evil and vice" is not such a stretch of the imagination. 
Historically, images of floods sweeping away the sinners of 
the world have peppered religious doctrine and some here 
believe Casablanca may be overdue for a cleansing.

Here's Lookin' at You Casa...

¶4. (U) We can confirm nearly twenty-four hours after the 
predicted tidal wave, Casablanca has been left unscathed. 
Despite a few nervous moments during the week when the sky 
darkened and the surf increased slightly, Casablanca remains 
intact.
