Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli. Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
¶1.  (S) SUMMARY: Foreign Minister Norman Caldera recently 
told DAS Madison, USAID's DAA Magan, and Ambassador that he 
will continue hammering Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez and 
Sandinista (FSLN) leader Daniel Ortega on their false 
accusations of U.S. intervention in Nicaragua's internal 
affairs.  He believes that Chavez' public endorsement of 
Ortega has "cleared the air" over recent criticism of the 
U.S. Ambassador's public statements.  Caldera also thinks the 
Venezuelan oil deal with members of Nicaragua's Mayors' 
Association is designed to attract more voters to Ortega. 
When he travels to Washington next week, Caldera will meet 
with OAS officials to request assistance in preparing a draft 
reform electoral law and impress upon them the need prevent 
presidential candidate disqualifications.  Caldera warned 
that the FSLN is poised to commit grand fraud in the November 
elections.  He also suggested Nicaragua might be able to 
accept two or three of the Uighur detainees in Guantanamo 
(Reftels).  END SUMMARY. 
 
CALLING OFF THE "HOUNDS" 
- - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶2.  (C) Foreign Minister Norman Caldera told DAS Madison, 
USAID's DAA Magan, and Ambassador on April 26 of his plans to 
continue hammering Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez and FSLN 
leader Daniel Ortega on their false accusations of U.S. 
intervention in Nicaragua's internal affairs.  In Caldera's 
view, the Venezuelans, not the Americans are guilty of 
intervention, as evidenced by Chavez' recent public 
endorsement of Ortega.  On the positive side, Chavez' 
unabashed endorsement has "cleared the air" over recent 
criticism of the U.S. Ambassador's public statements.  Now 
the U.S. has a "clean slate" to continue speaking out 
frankly, opined Caldera.  Chavez's notion that if an action 
suits him (and Ortega) it is "solidarity," while if an action 
counters his interests, it is "intervention," is nonsense. 
The Foreign Minister shared that he will be doing some 
straight talking of his own next week when he travels to 
Washington to meet with the Heritage Foundation and a number 
of U.S. lawmakers, including some who do not share his and 
the Nicaraguan government's assessment of the Ortega threat. 
 
APPROACHING THE OAS ON ELECTORAL REFORM AND NATIONAL IDS

¶3.  (C)  During his time in Washington, Caldera will also 
meet with OAS officials to request assistance in preparing a 
draft reform electoral law.  He explained that the 
Inter-American Human Rights court in San Jose had ruled in 
favor of Miskito party YATAMA that Nicaragua's current 
electoral law violates human rights as there is currently no 
recourse through the courts to contest a decision by the 
Supreme Electoral Commission (CSE).  Caldera explained that 
he will use this decision as an excuse to seek broader 
electoral reforms.  Doing so, he believes, might also draw 
YATAMA away from the FSLN (Note: A dissident YATAMA faction 
opposes YATAMA leadership's alliance with Ortega.  Post, 
through IRI, is helping this dissident group arrange a 
special assembly on May 14-15 to counter Ortega's proposed 
accord with YATAMA.  End Note.) 
 
¶4.  (C)  In addition to discussing the electoral law, Caldera 
will raise with the OAS a case involving the right of 
overseas Nicaraguans to apply for, and receive, national ID 
cards (cedulas).  The CSE has not provided the cedula 
application form to consulates abroad so that expats may 
register for the document, he explained.  (Note: Cedulas also 
serve as voter ID cards.  Either a cedula or a temporary 
cedula is required to vote.)  Caldera added that he will also 
broach his concerns that the OAS must be prepared to counter 
the CSE if it disqualifies presidential candidates 
Montealegre or Lewites. 
 
THE FSLN STAGED THE MARCH ELECTIONS TO LOOK GOOD 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶5. (C) Continuing on the elections theme, Caldera warned that the FSLN is poised to commit major fraud on November 5 to give Ortega a chance to win the presidency and to ensure the FSLN continues to enjoy ample representation in the National Assembly. Caldera opined that the FSLN hoodwinked the country by refraining from fraud during the March Atlantic Coast elections to lull people into believing that they have nothing to worry about in the November national elections, when much more is at stake.
 
FORWARD MOVEMENT ON CAFTA, POSSIBLY MANPADS 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶6.  (C)  The Ambassador remarked that despite the current 
problems, some progress had been made, citing the fact that 
Assembly President Eduardo Gomez had assured him that the 
Legislature will soon place MANPADS destruction on its agenda 
and that in a recent meeting with Assembly deputies, 
including two Sandinistas, the group indicated that the 
destruction of 651 MANPADS might be feasible.  Sharing the 
Ambassador's optimism, Caldera noted that CAFTA is already 
making a positive impact.  Thanks to CAFTA two new textile 
factories, one U.S. and one Taiwanese, will expand their 
operations in Nicaragua.  He explained that during the 
Sandinista era, Nicaragua was left behind in developing its 
textile industry, but CAFTA will turn around the situation. 
 
EU WOOS CENTAMS ON FREE TRADE ACCORD 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶7.  (C) Foreign Minister Caldera mentioned that he and other 
Central American foreign ministers will travel to Vienna next 
month to meet EU countries to discuss a free trade agreement. 
 The EU does not want to see Chevrolets replacing Mercedes, 
quipped Caldera, and is offering up front to eliminate 
tariffs on Central American bananas to sweeten the deal. 
Ambassador remarked that the Europeans are tough negotiators. 
 Caldera concurred, expecting considerable "table banging" 
before they will reach agreement, which will be complicated 
by the EU's desire for one Central American negotiator, not 
five.  Achieving a unitary negotiating team, however, only 
makes sense for those Centam countries covered by a customs 
union and a common external tariff, explained Caldera, who 
added that neither Panama nor Costa Rica currently adhere to 
that joint regimen. 
 
NICARAGUA MIGHT ACCEPT TWO OR THREE UIGHURS

¶8.  (S) Following up on the possible resettlement of Uighur 
men who had been Guantanamo detainees (Reftels), Caldera 
remarked that the Nicaraguan government is currently 
reviewing the list of detainees and might be able to accept 
two or three.  "Friends must help another," he said.
