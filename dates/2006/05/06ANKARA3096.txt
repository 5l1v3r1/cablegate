SUBJECT: TURKEY'S ATTENDANCE AT PSI HIGH-LEVEL POLITICAL 
MEETING 
 
REF: STATE 84640 
 
¶1. (SBU) We approached the MFA team attending the Anatolian 
Sun PSI exercise in Antalya on May 26 about the GOT's planned 
attendance at the June 23 High Level Political Meeting.  MFA 
officials said their initial thinking was that International 
Security Affairs Director General (A/S equivalent) Tomur 
Bayer would represent Turkey in Poland. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment:  Turkey was represented by a Director 
General at the high level meeting in 2004.  The Turkish 
delegation of one at that meeting felt the gathering served 
only a symbolic function as most speakers simply extolled the 
value of PSI.  We are prepared to engage again, after GOT 
officials return from Anatolian Sun, to urge a higher level 
representative attend from Ankara.  That effort would be 
easier if we could point to some difference between this 
meeting and that in 2004.  Any information Washington or 
Warsaw could provide on that score would be appreciated.  End 
comment.
