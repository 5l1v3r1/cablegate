¶1. (U) Summary:  Nine people have died in Guangdong after 
receiving injections containing a toxic chemical provided by 
a fraudulent supplier.  An initial investigation by central- 
government agencies has also pinned blame on the 
manufacturer's lack of internal quality control.  The State 
Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) has ordered local drug 
administrations to examine pharmaceutical suppliers and 
manufacturers.  Premier Wen Jiabao expressed concern about 
the case, saying that China's pharmaceutical industry "is in 
chaos."  End summary

¶2. (U) Authorities in Guangdong first learned of a problem 
with defective doses of Armillarisin A on May 3, when 
patients who received the drug developed acute kidney 
problems.  After identifying the Heilongjiang-based 
manufacturer, Qiqihar No. 2 Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., 
authorities shut down the plant and banned the sale of the 
company's medication.  Officials from the ministries of 
supervision, public security, and health, as well as the 
SFDA, went to Heilongjiang to investigate.  The Guangdong 
Public Security Bureau (PSB) -- which has taken over the 
case -- made an on-site investigation of the plant. 
Authorities have taken 14 suspects into custody and have 
questioned five employees of Qiqihar, including the general 
manager and a procurement employee. 
 
¶3. (U) A preliminary investigation showed that the company 
used diglycol instead of propylene glycol in the production 
of the Armillarisni A.  Armillarisni A is used to treat gall 
bladder, liver, and gastric disorders.  Diglycol is an 
industrial material that causes acute kidney failure if 
taken by humans.  The investigation revealed that the 
supplier, Wang Guiping, used forged documentation to 
associate himself with a Jiangsu chemical Qplies company. 
The investigation also faulted Qiqihar's quality inspectors 
for not catching the fake ingredient.  Sun Yat-sen 
University's No. 3 Affiliated Hospital was reportedly the 
only medical facility to administer the drug.  According to 
press reports, nine people have died thus far, two are 
comatose, and others are hospitalized. 
 
¶4. (U) On May 19, SFDA issued a circular stating that local 
drug administrations should "launch comprehensive checks of 
raw materials purchased, management of materials and 
examination of finished products of pharmaceutical plants." 
Premier Wen Jiabao stated in televised remarks that "a firm 
decision should be made to rein in the pharmaceutical 
market, which is in chaos." 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Several corners were cut in the lead-up to this 
incident, including an illegal supplier who sold a fake 
chemical and a drug firm that neglected to inspect its raw 
materials.  In addition, the Guangzhou hospital had recently 
decided to use Armillarisin A as a cheaper alternative to 
earlier-used medications.  As evidenced by Wen Jiabao's 
pointed remarks, the health of China's pharmaceutical 
industry is a serious concern for the country's leaders and 
has consequences that reach beyond the purely economic. 
China has been more attentive in following up on health and

safety issues than on other intellectual property issues but 
numerous reports regarding harmful drugs and foods continue 
to surface in the local press.
