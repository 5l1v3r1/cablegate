SUBJECT: DAS MADISON UNDERSCORES NEED FOR CONTINUOUS OAS 
LEADERSHIP ON THE GROUND 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli. Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
¶1.  (SBU) During an April 26 meeting with OAS Country 
Director Pedro Vuskovich, visiting DAS Kirsten Madison, USAID 
DAA Mike Magan, and the Ambassador underscored the importance 
of continuous OAS observation and political leadership on the 
ground throughout Nicaragua's entire election period. 
Vuskovich advised that the OAS special electoral mission will 
arrive in Nicaragua by the end of April or early May; and 
that OAS-contracted technical director Patricio Gajardo will 
remain in Nicaragua throughout the process. 
 
¶2.  (C) Magan underscored the need for close coordination 
between the regular and special OAS missions.  Vuskovich 
concurred, explaining that his modest OAS mission is 
channeling its efforts into supporting the special electoral 
mission.  Adding that observation is the best way to dissuade 
fraud and to encourage high voter turnout, Vuskovich outlined 
his perception of the OAS special mission's three main tasks: 
 
-- Ensure political stability; 
 
--Ensure the technical integrity of the electoral process; 
and, 
 
--Address the structural weaknesses of the electoral process. 
 
¶3.  (C) Noting they had heard OAS special mission leader 
Gustavo Fernandez' presence in Nicaragua might be 
intermittent, Madison and Magan impressed upon Vuskovich that 
it is paramount for OAS electoral mission chief Gustavo 
Fernandez to be in country at all times.  Vuskovich assured 
Madison that Fernandez and/or his deputy Raul Alconada will 
remain in Nicaragua, and he is confident they will make their 
presence known as needed.  The Ambassador emphasized the 
value of such political weight to deal with an eventual 
attempt by the CSE to disqualify a particular candidate.  He 
reminded Vuskovich that the OAS has also committed to forming 
a "group of notables" to appeal to the presidential 
candidates' desire for legitimacy and warn them of the high 
political costs they will incur if they attempt fraud or to 
disqualify a competitor. 
 
¶4.  (C) The Ambassador enumerated other concerns -- including 
the interpretation of Electoral Law 6; the Liberal 
Constitutional Party (PLC) magistrates' boycott of CSE 
sessions; and, the difficulties of Nicaraguans who do not 
identify with the Sandinistas (FSLN) to obtain national ID 
cards and/or to register to vote.  The Ambassador urged the 
OAS to coordinate its efforts with other donors, as well as 
with USAID and its CEPPS partners IFES, NDI, and IRI to 
resolve these and other issues.  He cited the fact that IFES 
is working within the CSE, and that CSE President Roberto 
Rivas has publicly acknowledged IFES's fine work in its 
training of CSE employees.  Vuskovich concurred that 
coordination is vital.  He then shared his frustrations in 
dealing with Nicaragua's often unpredictable, context-driven 
political culture, fretting that, instead of firmly adhering 
to political ideology, Nicaraguan politicians are driven by 
their personal interests of the moment.
