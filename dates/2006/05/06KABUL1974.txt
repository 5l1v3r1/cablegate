1.(SBU) SUMMARY: The Afghan government has begun 
un 
supplying telecom and Internet communications systems to 
all of its provinces and districts.  This fielding of 
Chinese and Indian made equipment, funded by the World Bank 
and USAID, is slowly coming to Paktika Province with the 
arrival last year of the Provincial Communications Network 
(PCN) in Sharana and District Communications Networks 
(DCNs) in Orgun-e, Yaya Khel and Khair Khot Districts in 
March 2006.  Although only in operation since the middle of 
March, the DCNs are proving to be very popular with a 
public who, until now, have had little to no access to 
reliable telecommunications or the internet.  In order to 
speed this much needed but slow to field program, PRT- 
Sharana is funding and supervising the construction of 
eight more district communications network buildings in 
Paktika in 2006.  This will speed the fielding of telephone 
and internet communications to remote districts across 
Paktika Province. The stabilization and security benefits 
of having solid telecommunications and internet systems 
throughout this frontier province, as soon as late summer 
2006, are expected to be significant.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.(SBU) A SMALL INVESTMENT MAY YIELD BIG SECURITY 
RESULTS: Paktikas PRT Civil Affairs project team has 
identified eight district communications network buildings 
as projects to be funded in their spring and summer 2006 
building season.  The communications buildings, constructed 
to Afghan government specifications, are simple, relatively 
inexpensive affairs consisting of two small buildings.  One 
building is for the telecom and internet equipment, and the 
other will house two small generators and fuel.  The 
districts that will receive PRT-built communications 
centers are War Mamay, Tarwa, Gomal, Dila, Kushamond, 
Yousef Khel, Omna and Waza Kwah.  These districts are all 
remote, and Tarwa, War Mamay and Gomal border the active 
tribal areas of Pakistan. 
 
3.(SBU) EQUIPMENT ON HAND, BUILDINGS NEEDED: The 
he 
equipment for the DCNs was purchased and received in Kabul 
last year.  With the communications equipment on hand and 
ready for fielding, the delay in getting this much needed 
communications to the public and, perhaps more 
significantly, to the Afghan Security Forces has been the 
ability of the Afghan government to fund and supervise the 
building of DCN buildings in the districts.  Afghan 
government plans called for the establishment of only three 
DCNs in Paktika in 2006.  PRT-Sharana, recognizing the 
security as well as stability benefits of connecting 
Afghanistans remote and often volatile districts to the 
rest of Afghanistan and thus the rest of the world, has now 
agreed to build an additional eight DCN buildings in 2006. 
 
4.(SBU) COMMENT: In the remote and underdeveloped 
province of Paktika, government and public access to 
reliable phone and internet service is a huge step forward. 
While the Afghan security forces are expected to 
significantly benefit from the reliable communications that 
t 
will come to the districts with the District Communications 
Networks, the reach of the Afghan government is also 
expected to be extended by these communication systems.  If 
the heavy use and popularity of the DCNs demonstrated in 
 
KABUL 00001974  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
the new center in Orgun-e is any indicator, the DCNs will 
prove popular with the public and will help to demonstrate 
the strength and reach of the Karzai government even into 
the most remote of Paktikas districts.  The PRTs 
assistance with DCN buildings will speed, by a matter of 
years, the fielding of DCNs throughout Paktika.  This is an 
idea that may be worth looking into in other areas of 
Afghanistan with significant security concerns and 
communications difficulties.  END COMMENT.
