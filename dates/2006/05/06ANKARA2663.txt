Â¶1. (SBU) In a diplomatic noted dated May 10, the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed us that Turkey 
supports the U.S. candidate, Ambassador (retired) 
Melvyn Levitsky, for re-election to the International 
Narcotics Control Board (INCB).  This decision came as 
a result of two diplomatic notes, two demarches, and a 
letter from Ambassador Wilson to Foreign Minister Gul 
requesting Turkey's support.
