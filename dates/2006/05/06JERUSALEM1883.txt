SUBJECT: FIRST SHIPMENT OF USD 10 MILLION IN MEDICAL 
ASSISTANCE ON ITS WAY TO GAZA 
 
 
¶1.  Two trucks loaded with medicine and medical supplies left 
the CARE International warehouse in Ramallah the morning of 
May 10, headed toward Gaza. The two truckloads are the first 
shipment as part of the USD 10 million pledge of in "in kind" 
medical assistance to the Palestinians that was announced May 
9 in New York by Secretary Rice. 
 
¶2.  The shipment was marked by a press event held at the CARE 
warehouse.  At the event, which was covered by local and 
international press, the Consul General noted that the 
shipment is just one part of ongoing US assistance to the 
Palestinians.  He emphasized the importance of assistance 
directly reaching the people who need it, saying, "The US is 
committed to making sure that the critical needs of the 
Palestinian people are met, and today's delivery is an 
example of our determination to do just that."  The Consul 
General also reiterated US support for the Roadmap and 
continuing interaction with President Abbas' office. 
 
¶3.  The Consul General and USAID Mission Director also 
highlighted a follow-on effort to supply health kits to 
Palestinian health care providers through UNICEF, as well as 
to deliver more emergency medical supplies to West Bank and 
Gaza clinics with the most urgent needs. 
 
¶4.  Questions from reporters at the event focused on how the 
US will continue to provide assistance and what kinds of 
assistance could be expected in the future.
