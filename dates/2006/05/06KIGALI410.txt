¶1. (U) On 28 April, DCM delivered the talking points from 
refs to Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation Secretary 
General Amandin Rugira. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Rugira said he was aware of the reported lack of 
response by African Union forces in close proximity to 
attacks on civilians in Darfur.  He said the events were 
unfortunate but that the lack of AU response was probably due 
to limited capacity despite the troops' "committment to 
protect the people." 
 
¶3. (SBU) DCM noted that NATO support would help the mission's 
capacity and delivered talking points from reference B. 
Rugira agreed that there could be value added by NATO 
involvement but said that it would need to be discussed more. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Rugira agreed whole-heartedly that Iran should not 
be allowed a seat on the UN Human Rights Council (HRC)(ref 
C). He said he was surprised the GOI is bidding for a seat on 
the HRC and noted that Iran is not complying with the UN 
rules regarding nuclear inspections so supporting their 
candidacy for a seat on the HRC should not be considered.
