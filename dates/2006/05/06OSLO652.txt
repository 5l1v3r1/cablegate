(SBU) We delivered talking points to Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs Deputy Office Director for East African Affairs Kjell 
Hodnebo on May 19.  Hodnebo thanked us for the USG's 
continued strong actions to secure peace in Sudan and efforts 
to coordinate actions among all parties.  Norwegians are 
continuing to work with Khartoum and GOSS officials to 
implement the CPA and the new Darfur Peace Agreement. 
Hodnebo mentioned that Norwegians are encouraging SPLM 
officials to speed preparations for a meeting in Juba with 
the SLM faction not party to the peace accord in an effort to 
persuade them to sign the document.  Regarding UN rehatting, 
he said, as others have told us, that Norway is ready to 
contribute to a UN-MIS once asked to do so.
