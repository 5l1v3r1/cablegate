SUBJECT: SPANISH TROOP INCREASE IN QAL I NOW WILL YIELD 
GREATER PRT OUTREACH 
 
Ambassador Neumann traveled May 7 to the Spanish PRT at Qal I 
Now.  PRT Commander Colonel Alonso gave a presentation 
focusing on the security situation in Badghis Province and 
Spanish Aid Agency (AECI) development efforts.  Other than in 
the two northern districts with Pashtun majorities, the 
threat level is low throughout the province.  However, the 
smallish size of the current Spanish troop contingent has 
prevented regular patrols outside the capital city and 
therefore limited the movement of the State PRTOff or the 
expansion of AECI projects outside the provincial capital. 
Colonel Alonso indicated that the impending increase in 
troops would allow the PRT to increase the number of patrols 
outside the city, allow greater security support of AECI 
projects in the districts and provide for greater support for 
PRTOff to conduct outreach and reporting outside of Qal I 
Now.  (Note: according to Madrid Daily Report, the increase 
of 150 was approved May 11 by the Spanish Parliament.  The 
first 70 departed Spain May 12.  End Note.)
