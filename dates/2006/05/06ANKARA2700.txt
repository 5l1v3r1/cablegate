SUBJECT: TURKEY: MFA ANNOUNCEMENT ON DARFUR PEACE AGREEMENT 
 
 
(U) The Turkish Foreign Ministry issued the following 
announcement May 12 concerning the Darfur peace agreement. 
Informal Embassy translation follows. 
 
Begin text: 
 
Turkey is pleased that the Peace Agreement prepared by the 
African Union with the purpose of resolving the problem in 
Darfur was signed by the government of Sudan and the Minnawi 
faction of the Sudanese Liberation Army, which is the biggest 
group in the region, on May 5, 2006 in Abuja. 
 
We believe that the agreement mentioned above -- which we 
expect will help in the re-establishment of peace and 
confidence in the Darfur Region of Sudan -- will contribute 
to peace and stability in the region and generally in Africa 
as well as contribute to development of the country in unity, 
prosperity and stability.  We hope that the agreement will be 
signed by the other groups in the region as soon as possible. 
 
We recall that our Prime Minister, during his visit to Sudan 
at the end of March this year, visited Darfur and personally 
witnessed the human tragedy at the refugee camps there.  In 
order to ensure that the pain experienced be eased to some 
extent, he ordered the establishment of a field hospital in 
the region by the Turkish Red Crescent.  This hospital was 
sent to Darfur and work is underway to construct it. 
Establishment of permanent peace in Darfur will help 
intensify Turkey's support and assistance to Sudan and the 
Darfur region as well."
