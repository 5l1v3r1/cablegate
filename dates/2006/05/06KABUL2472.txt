¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The UNDP/ANBP program to remove 
mines and ammunition from Panjshir is reaching a 
critical juncture.  As it nears successful 
completion of work at the site of Parakh, it now 
takes on a greater challenge at Paranday, both in 
terms of depot size and local resistance.  UNDP/ANBP 
officials report they will start at a slow pace and 
use Afghan trucks and personnel.  The PRT is working 
behind the scenes to play a supportive role. 
Paranday was the scene of earlier confrontations 
over ammo removal and may be again.  END SUMMARY. 
 
State of Play 
------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The United Nations Development Programme 
(UNDP) and AfghanistanQs New Beginnings Programme 
(ANBP) have removed over 650 loads by Kamaz truck 
from Panjshir after almost a year of work.  Reftel 
(QAmmo Removal Gains MomentumQ) reported on the 
mounting progress of the overall effort, while 
cautioning that the next big undertaking, at the 
Paranday depot, would be challenging.  Paranday is 
located in central Panjshir, in a side valley seven 
km north of MassoudQs tomb.  It was the scene of two 
confrontations last year when locals stopped UN 
convoys.  In the second incident December 13, the 
convoy came under fire. 
 
UNDP/ANBP Approach 
------------------ 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Recently, PRTQers have been meeting with 
UNDP/ANBP officials in Panjshir and Kabul concerning 
next steps for the Mine and Ammunition Project in 
the province.  These officials tell us: 
 
-- Clearing of the Parakh site, part of the 
GovernorQs compound and next to the PRT office, is 
nearing completion.  So far, UNDP/ANBP has removed 
340 loads by Kamaz truck from Parakh.  Most of the 
ammo is unserviceable and loose.  Citing political 
sensitivity, the Governor slowed down the removal 
rate, which at one point reached up to twenty trucks 
per day, but is now down to two or three.  UNDP/ANBP 
expects to wrap up work at the site by the end of 
May. 
 
-- The next site, Paranday, is more challenging. 
Its ammo stocks are large:  equivalent to 500 truck 
loads.  The ammo is serviceable and packaged.  It 
includes artillery shells, mortar rounds, anti-tank 
and anti-personnel mines.  There are several 
containers of pistols, but no AK-47s.  Stocks are 
all of Soviet origin. 
 
-- UNDP/ANBP intends to Qtread with careQ as it 
restarts its work there in early June.  In an 
agreement worked out with Panjshiri officials, 
UNDP/ANBP will use trucks from the Afghan Defense 
Ministry, and not from the UN.  Only two trucks, 
loaded and driven by Afghans, will be in operation 
per day.  After two weeks, UNDP/ANBP will reassess 
these modalities.

Afghan Role 
----------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Several Panjshiris are playing key roles 
concerning ammo removal from Paranday.  Panjshir 
Governor Bahlul Qblows hot and coldQ on the Paranday 
effort, according to a UNDP/ANBP official.  The 
Governor told a visiting NATO delegation May 17 that 
ammo removal was Qproceeding well, but faced 
political opposition from Panjshiris concerned about 
the deterioration of security in southern 
Afghanistan.Q  According to our contacts and our own 
observations, he is sensitive to local political 
pressure to go slow on removal.  UNDP/ANBP officials 
plan to meet with him regularly and press for a 
Qsecurity guaranteeQ on Paranday. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Deputy Governor Kabiri has the operational 
lead on Paranday among Panjshiri officials.  He told 
us he is committed to seeing through the effort, but 
needs political and material support.  He requested 
some humanitarian aid.  He said some Afghan-funded 
projects were already underway there. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Wolesei Jirga member Registani is becoming 
increasingly vocal in his opposition to ammo 
removal.  This spring he started speaking on the 
matter at Panjshir mosques during Friday services. 
On May 12, the parliamentarian voiced his criticism 
at several mosques in the valley.  He claims that 
ammo removal is a QmistakeQ given the need for 
Panjshiris to retain the ability to fight again 
against the Taliban, if necessary.  Our contacts 
report that his themes resonate among the 
Panjshiris.  UNDP/ANBP officials call him a Qbit of 
a problem.Q  They have raised his opposition with 
Army Chief of Staff Bismullah Khan and are prepared 
to go to First VP Massoud as well. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Mallowi Mohammed Khan, who lives in 
Paranday across from the depot, reportedly 
instigated the attack on UNDP/ANBP in December. 
First VP Massoud ordered his arrest, but the 
religious leader was able to avoid it.  Reportedly, 
he still resides in Paranday.  He argues that ammo 
removal is ill-conceived for two main reasons: 
because the ammo is removed and then sold illegally 
to line the pockets of government officials; and 
because the central government is not capable of 
providing security for the country, as the 
resurgence of violence in the south demonstrates. 
According to UNDP/ANBP, he has agreed to accept ammo 
removal in Paranday, but only through a passive 
stance. 
 
PRT Support 
----------- 
 
¶8.  (SBU) On Paranday, the PRT is in close contact 
with the Governor and Deputy Governor, but do not 
intend to approach Regestani or Mallowi Mohammed 
Khan.  We will play a behind-the-scenes role.  We 
met with the Deputy Governor to discuss possible 
projects in Paranday to ease the political 
controversy over ammo removal.  Projects from both 
 
KABUL 00002472  003.2 OF 003 
 
 
military funding (CERP) and USAID funding (QIP) are 
under consideration.  We will also work with ENTES, 
the contractor for the main road, to apprise 
Panjshiri officials when work will start near 
Paranday, expected this summer. 
 
¶9.  (SBU) PRTQers did a familiarization drive 
through Paranday May 27, accompanied by local 
police.  They came upon a checkpoint at the southern 
end of the valley and used a narrow road climbing 
3,000 feet in altitude.  The ammo containers, over 
50 in all, lined the road; some ammo and weapons 
were visible.  The PRTQers encountered only sparse 
population.  They located a middle school that could 
be a recipient of school supplies.  They determined 
that Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and 
Development was working to improve the road and 
build a seven km retaining wall. 
 
¶10.  (SBU) Comment: There are nine depots surveyed 
by UNDP/ANBP in Panjshir, representing more than 
1,500 truck loads of ammo and mines.  The site in 
Paranday may be the most challenging, certainly from 
a political standpoint.  The UNDP/ANBP strategy 
appears sound:  building momentum at other sites, 
consulting closely with Afghan officials in Panjshir 
and Kabul, and starting cautiously in Paranday.  The 
PRT will do its part.  Nonetheless, ammo removal at 
Paranday still has the potential to turn 
confrontational.  End Comment.
