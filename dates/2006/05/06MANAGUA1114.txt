REF: STATE 78762 
 
¶1. (SBU) Poloff met with Ambassador Domingo Salinas, Director 
of Western Hemisphere Affairs at the Nicaraguan Foreign 
Ministry (MFA), on May 19 to discuss points in reftel. 
Salinas explained that he would need to discuss the issue 
with his counterparts in relevant GON agencies before 
offering a firm response, but seemed positive about offering 
resettlement opportunities to at least a few of the refugees, 
especially the Cubans. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Salinas recounted a situation in 2004 when a group 
of 12-15 Cuban migrants were detained in the Bahamas.  The 
GON received a personal request to assist via U.S. 
Representatives in Florida.  In response, the MFA arranged 
with a group of nuns called the "Hermanas en Cristo" (Sisters 
in Christ) to provide resettlement services and a cigar 
manufacturer of Cuban descent in the department of Esteli 
offered to provide employment in his factory.  The Bahamas 
never responded to the Nicaraguan offer, however, and Salinas 
believes the migrants were sent back to Cuba.  Poloff offered 
that perhaps the network established in 2004 could be 
reactivated to accommodate some of the Cubans mentioned in 
reftel, and Salinas agreed. 
 
¶3. (U) Post will report additional developments.
