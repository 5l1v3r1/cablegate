SUBJECT:  CHOICE OF DIGITAL TELEVISION STANDARD STILL ON HOLD 
 
REF: Brasilia 587 and previous 
 
¶1.  (U) During recent weeks the issue of which standard the 
Brazilian government will embrace for digital television (DTV) has 
faded from public view as President Lula has (so far) declined to 
endorse the recent MOU signed with the Japanese.  Meanwhile, 
continued technical progress by industry on the ATSC standard has 
caught the notice of at least one GOB policymaker.  In a May 7 
interview with "O Estado de Sao Paulo" columnist Sonia Racy, 
Minister of Trade Luiz Furlan described his view of the state of 
play on DTV.  Informal translation of the article is set forth in 
paragraph 2. 
 
¶2.  (U)  BEGIN TEXT OF INFORMAL TRANSLATION 
 
DIGITAL TV - SEARCHING FOR THE BEST LONG-TERM MODEL 
 
Minister Luiz Furlan has avoided talking more explicitly about 
digital TV.  In this interview, he agreed for the first time to 
clarify some points before traveling to Europe where among others, 
he will meet with investors interested in digital TV in Vienna. 
 
President Lula, taking advantage of his participation in the 
European Community-Mercosul seminar taking place in Vienna, will 
participate in meetings to discuss proposals on the table regarding 
the process. 
 
Furlan clearly stated that contrary to press reports, he was never 
in favor of any model.  He also stated that there is no agreement 
with the Japanese, other than a memorandum of understanding that is 
non-binding and depends on decisions to be made by the Brazilian 
government. 
 
And, he reiterated that the interest in building a semiconductor 
factory is linked to fiscal incentives under study. 
 
Here are excerpts from his interview: 
 
Q: You defended the European digital TV model.  What happened? 
 
A: I never defended any of the models.  My position from the 
beginning has been that we should take advantage of this moment when 
we have to choose new technology to attract new investments to 
Brazil, deepening the electro-electronic productive chain, one of 
the pillars of industrial policy, which we have not been able to 
consolidate to date.  In the choice of the model, we can learn and 
dominate the new HDTV technology, which is very important. 
 
Q: Why is this important? 
 
A: It enables Brazilian research institutions and universities to 
adapt and perfect the Brazilian system of digital TV, based on 
foreign technology, but with improvements and development completed 
by around 30 domestic institutions, which conduct experiments in 
this area today.  My position is to negotiate the one that is best 
for Brazil looking forward 20 years, not just make the best deal 
now. 
 
Q: Several ministers went on this trip to Japan.  Who was it that 
negotiated the digital TV agreement? 
 
A: The trip was set up by President Lula, who decided that the 
contacts with the government would be made by Ambassador Celso 
Amorim.  And that media contacts would be coordinated by me.  That 
is what happened. 
 
Q: Didn't the Brazilian government choose the Japanese model? 
 
A:  No.  The choice will eventually be made by President Lula. 
There was a technical analysis showing that at this time the 
Japanese model is technically superior, because it is the latest. 
The Americans are modifying their model, which is older, and this 
could upgrade it beyond the Japanese model.  Technically, all three 
existing models, over time, will have a certain equivalency.  There 
are other factors like the size of the market.  While the Japanese

model exists only in Japan, the American model is in North America 
and Korea, and the European model is used in 56 countries. 
 
Q: Are the Japanese going to build a semiconductor factory in 
Brazil? 
 
A: Through a proposal of ours, one of the companies expressed an 
interest.  But whether this kind of factory goes ahead will depend 
on a set of economic incentives provided by the Brazilian 
government.  This indication was given by the Finance Ministry, and 
by President Lula himself in meetings held over time. 
 
Q: Why is it so important for the country to have this kind of 
factory? 
 
A:  I can give an example.  When the binational Brazil-Italy Embraer 
project for manufacture of the AMX jet went forward, one of the 
conditions imposed was that we would open the electronic systems 
source codes.  That is why it was possible to manufacture a series 
of these military jets in Brazil and Italy, but what was learned 
with absorption of technology enabled Embraer to evolve and apply 
this technology to commercial jets.  The same would happen with the 
absorption of digital TV technology. 
 
Q: Is it possible to separate the choice of the digital TV model 
from the factory construction? 
 
A:  Construction of the factory is interdependent on the size of the 
market and export capacity.  No one builds a factory for just the 
domestic market.  What is being discussed is the system that will be 
adopted by the TV broadcasters, for content generation and signal 
emission.  When we were in Japan, the Japanese industries informed 
us that they are producing TV sets using three technologies, that 
is, manufacturing for the United States, Europe and Japan.  They 
showed us the insides of a flat screen demo TV, and truthfully, 
there are two plates that are taken out and substituted from one 
model to another.  There is no difficulty in producing these sets. 
Now the factory is a condition.  President Lula's guidance is that 
we will only close the deal when we have a guarantee of investment. 
 
END TEXT OF INFORMAL TRANSLATION 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment.  Furlan's comments are a counterpoint to Minister 
of Communications Helio Costa's repeated endorsement (indeed 
advocacy) of the Japanese standard.  As post has noted previously 
(reftel), the longer the GoB decision process, the better for the 
ATSC standard. The soft-pedaling on the semiconductor issue may be 
an admission that the deal is not as cut and dry as previously 
portrayed by the GoB.  Time will tell on this one.
