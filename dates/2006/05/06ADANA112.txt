SUBJECT: TURKEY: FORMER PRESIDENT SULEYMAN DEMIRAL STUMPS IN ADANA 
 
¶1. (SBU) In a May 16 keynote speech to kick off his stump around 
the region, center-right octogenarian former President Suleyman 
Demirel sung the praises of the Turkish secular state.  Speaking 
for over one hour at Cukurova University before an audience of 
more than 500 people (approximately 25 percent were students), 
Demirel offered a message of solidarity and unity for Turkey, 
calling on the youth to uphold the principles of the Turkish 
Republic as established by Ataturk. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Citing the continuing lack of clean drinking water, 
proper education and health facilities in some parts of Turkey, 
Demirel called on Turks to follow the example of the 
economically developed countries, whose wealth was based on the 
three pillars of market economy, democracy and human rights.  He 
recommended that Turkey remove the state from all aspects of the 
economy in order to allow the market to flourish, and for Turkey 
to better adapt to world economic forces.  Demirel emphasized 
the importance of entrepreneurial initiative and the education 
of Turkey's youth, especially in science and technology, as a 
means to ensure the country's continuing development. 
 
¶3. (SBU) He emphasized that every citizen is a first class 
citizen, and that there should be no differentiation among 
people in any part of the country.  He said that Turks should 
distinguish between the people and the terrorist component 
within society (the PKK), and emphasized that everyone should 
work for the unity of the state, which should implement the rule 
of law and abide by the constitution.  Demirel criticized Europe 
for inciting problems within Turkey.  He said that Europe has 
seen Turkey so far as a liberation project for a certain 
community of people (i.e., Kurds).  He added that Europe's 
meddling in the Kurdish issue was based on two misconceptions: 
1) that Turkey's parliament had not been representing the people 
of Turkey; and 2) that certain people have been deprived of 
their social rights, such as employment, etc.  Nevertheless, 
Demirel sees the Turkish Republic as a European project, and 
added that no one in the country yearns for a sharia regime. 
Demirel made it clear that the state should remain secular and 
there should be strong barriers between the state and all 
religions. 
 
¶4. (SBU) An engineer by training, Demiral got his start in 
politics as a managing engineer on State hydro-electric projects 
in the Cukurova region. 
 
¶5.  Demirel is the grand old man of Turkish politics.  He has 
been active in Turkish politics for forty years, served as Prime 
Minister and President, and was jailed by the military.  His 
feel for Turkey's political pulse has been unmatched, except 
perhaps by PM Erdogan.  Media have recently speculated that he 
is on the comeback trail, perhaps stitching together a 
center-right coalition to challenge the ruling Justice and 
Development Party (AKP).  This speech was clear criticism of 
AKP, as were Demirel's comments in April criticizing the failure 
of AKP policy on Islamic headscarves.  However, Demirel at this 
point appears to be a has-been unlikely to get much traction; 
his desire to go out on the stump at the age of 82, however, 
indicates the importance he attaches to rallying an opposition 
with teeth that has a chance at defeating AKP.
