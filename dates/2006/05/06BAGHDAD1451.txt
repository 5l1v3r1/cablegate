SUBJECT: IRAQ PRTs WEEKLY ROUNDUP FOR 14-20 APR 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY.  The Provincial 
Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) report weekly their 
activities and progress towards helping the provincial 
governments achieve self-governance capability.  The 
following paragraphs include summaries of their 
activities in several areas for the period 14-20 April. 
Receipt of reconstruction and development funds from 
Baghdad created a minor struggle to control 
expenditures within the Ninewa Provincial Council (PC). 
The Baghdad PC partially ended its boycott of USG 
entities but continued to refuse engagement on 
governance and economic development issues.  While the 
PC boycott in Babil appears to be winding down, and 
business slowly returned to a more normal practice, no 
one is certain that it will not re-surface in the 
coming weeks.  END INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY. 
 
--------------- 
NINEWA PROVINCE 
--------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) GOVERNANCE. The Ninewa PRT reported increased 
political infighting over who controls the $20M 
reconstruction and development money from the Baghdad 
central government.  Some unexpected outcomes from this 
battle for control include a more independent stance 
from political parties previously allied with the 
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), calls from many PC 
members for open votes to ensure the money is spent 
fairly, and completion of a Master Project List from 
which they can shop for funding. 
 
¶3. (U) The City Municipality Manager for trash 
collection told the PRT that funding and curfew 
limitations will make it impossible for his department 
to meet trash collection needs.  The Directorate 
General (DG) confirmed this in a separate meeting with 
PRT staff. A joint Iraqi-PRT taskforce will research 
the trash issue and formulate options for improvement. 
 
¶4. (SBU) SECURITY. There was a spike in insurgent 
activity over the past week, mostly involving incidents 
of small arms fire.  Coalition Forces (CF) recently 
detained several high ranking anti-Iraqi force (AIF) 
members, and it is believed that the increased 
insurgent activity was in retaliation for CF 
successes.  PRT members predict the insurgents are most 
likely in a period of restructuring their organizations 
(cells) and are attempting to bring in new leadership. 
 The greatest number of indirect fire (IDF) incidents 
this year was recorded in April.  This frequency has 
not been noted since the summer months of 2005. 
 
¶5. (U) INFRASTRUCTURE. The Dahuk Director of Electrical 
Transmission asked the PRT for assistance in finding 
funding for an ongoing electrical problem in Dahuk and 
to a lesser extent in Ninewa.  PRT members visited the 
site and determined that adding capacitor banks to the 
designated substations would help clean the power 
imported from Turkey.  The existing problem has existed 
for at least two years and has resulted in a 
significant portion of imported power being unusable. 
Future expectation is that 20 to 25 percent of Ninewa 
Province power would come from Turkish imports. 
 
--------------- 
KIRKUK PROVINCE 
--------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) SECURITY.  The security situation in Kirkuk 
worsened this week.  There were 19 incidents in Kirkuk 
from 13-19 April.  CF, Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) and 
Iraqi Police (IP) were the primary insurgency targets. 
New tactics and techniques in insurgency attacks led 
PRT members to believe that there is new AIF leadership 
in command. 
 
¶7. (U) INFRASTRUCTURE.  Fuel prices continued to drop 
in Kirkuk, perhaps aided by increased inspections by

the Iraqi Army and Police.  Electricity supply for 
Kirkuk has been reportedly consistent at 14 hours per 
day since the Taza Power Plant came online. 
 
---------------- 
BAGHDAD PROVINCE 
---------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) POLITICAL. The Baghdad PC voted to renew its 
dialogue with USG officials on security, 
reconstruction, and essential services.  However, the 
PC continued to boycott talks on governance and 
economic development. The PRT access and engagement 
with the PC subcommittees, City Hall, and district 
councils remained restricted. 
 
¶9. (U) RULE OF LAW.  The PRT Rule of Law (RoL) Working 
Group focused its weekly meeting on ways to 
decentralize elements of the Iraqi Police, raise local 
government funds for such units, and facilitate 
provincial oversight and public acceptance of security 
forces within the governorate.  PRT members are working 
with the PC security and media relations committees and 
the Baghdad Police Transition Team to develop a 
coordinated media campaign to help bridge the gap 
between provincial political leaders and ISF 
commanders. 
 
-------------- 
BABIL PROVINCE 
-------------- 
 
¶10. (SBU) POLITICAL.  The Babil PC officially continued 
to boycott the PRT and CF although many members met 
individually with PRT members.  PRT Team Leader held 
several meetings with the three top provincial leaders 
during the week and, while it appeared to be business 
as usual, he could not say with certainty that the 
boycott is over. On the growing Internally Displaced 
Persons (IDP) problem, the PRT organized a joint 
meeting of senior legislative and administrative 
government representatives.  The Iraqis pledged to 
administer an action plan to begin support for the 
approximately 914 IDP families in Babil.  USAID and the 
International Medical Corps agreed to monitor and 
assist. The action plan includes four provincial IDP 
registration centers to distribute emergency kits, 
coordinate security checks by provincial police, 
transfer school and food distribution records from the 
original province to Babil, and improve identification 
of IDP families to better craft additional support 
efforts. 
 
¶11. (U) RECONSTRUCTION.  The PRT encouraged the PC to 
form a Project Management Unit (PMU) to manage over 200 
projects financed with the reconstruction and 
development funds from the central government.  In a 19 
April meeting, 53 local government officials, including 
the Governor and PC Chairman, attended a PMU workshop. 
They approved functional statements for each of the 
three offices that will make up the PMU - accounting, 
legal, and technical oversight.
