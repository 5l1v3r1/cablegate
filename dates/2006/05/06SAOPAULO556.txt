"Change To Remain The Same" 
 
Liberal Folha de S. Paulo (5/19) editorialized: "The UN Human Rights 
Committee no longer exists.  It was replaced by a new Human Rights 
Council. But everything will remain as was before. The Committee had 
53 members, including some of the world's main human rights 
violators.  An organization responsible for taking care of human 
rights that includes among its members nations such as Saudi Arabia, 
China, Cuba, Indonesia, Pakistan and Russia cannot be taken 
seriously.... The farce of the Committee has been changed for by the 
tragedy of the Council. But what would be just one among so many 
setbacks has a bitter taste for Brazil. The GOB has proclaimed that 
Brazil was the second most voted nation among the Council's 47 
members.  But such a performance only became possible because the 
Foreign Ministry adhered to a practice of trading votes. It obtained 
so many votes because it made a composition with the worst human 
rights pariahs, in a process that undermines the credibility not 
only of the Council, but also of the UN. The art of diplomacy 
consists in balancing pragmatism and respect to greater principles. 
When, in a human rights matter, the foreign relations head 
sacrifices the second on behalf of the first, it becomes distant 
from the pattern that once placed Brazilian diplomacy among the best 
in the world."
