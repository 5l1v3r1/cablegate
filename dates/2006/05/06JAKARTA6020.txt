REF: SECSTATE 28470 
 
¶1.  Summary.  The Indonesian Air Force (AF) verified that a 
division of the Air Force Procurement Service has ordered 
the C-130 radar components detailed in reftel.  The AF seeks 
to purchase the C-130 radar components through their local 
agent PT. Dwi Anugrah, which sub-contracted the order to the 
Singapore firm Sintong Trading Company.  Dwi Anugrah 
officials declined to meet with us, but said they are not 
certain whether the transaction is still pending due to the 
possible expiry of their letter of credit.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  We contacted Indonesian AF Credit Export Officer Colonel 
Yuri Afiuddin Anwar on February 28, 2006 to confirm the 
order of C-130 radar components described in reftel. 
Colonel Yuri confirmed that AF Sub-Service Electronic 
Procurement Division, a division of the Air Force 
Procurement Service, has ordered the components listed in 
reftel.  Colonel Yuri noted that the Singaporean firm 
Sintong Trading Company is a business counterpart of the 
AF's local agent PT. Dwi Anugrah, which first received the 
order from the AF. 
 
¶3.  The AF Procurement Service ordered the C-130 radar parts 
under contract number 133/2113/D5/DP/2005/AF through Dwi 
Anugrah, which is located in Ruko Royal Sunter Block A-25, 
North Jakarta, Indonesia.  We called Dwi Anugrah and 
confirmed that Oki Benjamin Odang is the company's director, 
a point the AF also confirmed in a telephone conversation. 
 
¶4.  We requested a follow-up meeting with Dwi Anugrah to 
review and verify documentation on April 3, but they 
declined to meet.  Mr. Suwandi (one name only), on behalf of 
the company suggested he would first get confirmation from 
Sintong whether the transaction remains viable, and only 
then would meet us to review documentation if necessary. 
Suwandi stated that the order from the AF is legitimate and 
said his company sub-contracted it to Sintong, which in turn 
opened a letter of credit (L/C) for the order.  Suwandi 
expressed concern that the L/C may have expired due to 
delays in processing the order.
