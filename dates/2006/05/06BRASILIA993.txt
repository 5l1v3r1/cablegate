SUBJECT:  DESPITE RECENT RAIDS, BRASILIA'S PIRATE GOODS MARKETPLACE 
STILL THRIVES 
 
 
¶1. (U)  Summary.  According to an article published in the May 11 
"Correio Brazilense," more than 150,000 products, mostly pirated 
DVDs and CDs, were apprehended in raids at Brasilia's Feira dos 
Importados (i.e., the "Import Fair").  The operation mobilized 120 
police officers and closed down 95 retail outlets.  Despite the 
raid, a week later the market appeared to be functioning normally 
with widespread sale of pirated goods.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (U) On May 17 Econoff and Econ Assistant visited Brasilia's 
notorious pirate marketplace - the Feira dos Importados (i.e., the 
"Import Fair") - to determine whether after recent Federal Police 
raids pirated goods were still being sold there.  At the main 
entrance to the market, hundreds of pirated DVDs were on display in 
make-shift stalls.  Inside, all permanent stalls were open for 
business, most with obviously counterfeit products. 
 
¶3.  (U)  The offering of pirated DVDS included movies currently 
showing in Brasilia cinemas, such as "Capote," and the "Da Vinci 
Code" was being advertised as available the following week.  The 
quality of the "Capote" DVD was good, but was obviously a fake given 
its photocopy cover and low price of 5 reais (about US$2.40). 
Pirated Nike athletic shoes were on sale for 50% below the price of 
a genuine pair.  Low-priced Disney logo toys were also for sale with 
tags indicating they were imported through a company in Ciudad del 
Este, Paraguay.  One store offered pirate Microsoft Corel Draw CDs 
for R$5; legitimate copies are priced at hundreds of reais.  A 
number of stores also sold "unblocked" Sony PlayStations capable of 
running pirated DVD games.  If you already had a genuine 
PlayStation, the price to unblock it was R$200. 
 
¶4. (U)  Notwithstanding the presence of private security guards (but 
not police) ostensibly performing "inspections" at the fair, it was 
clear that vendors were openly selling pirated goods.  While the 
GOB's recent raids may have taken a dent out of the piracy trade, it 
is clear that the government failed to stop the sale of illegitimate 
products at the Import Fair.
