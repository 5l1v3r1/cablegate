SUBJECT: REQUEST COUNTRY CLEARANCE FOR BAGHDAD REFUGEE 
COORDINATOR CAMILLE HILL 
 
 
¶1. Country clearance is requested for the May 10 - 14 
travel of Baghdad Refugee Coordinator Camille Hill to 
Jordan.  Ms. Hill has filed an electronic request for 
travel form with ISU-Amman including requests for 
assistance with necessary hotel, regional air, and ground 
transportation arrangements, and is coordinating with 
Amman Refugee Coordinator Claire Kaneshiro. 
 
¶2. While in Jordan, Ms. Hill will attend a May 11 meeting 
with officials from UNHCR regional offices, ECHO, and 
Amman RefCoord to address Iraq-related UNHCR funding 
issues, UNHCR's temporary protection regime for Iraqis in 
the region, and related matters of interest to donors. 
Ms. Hill will also plans an introductory meeting with 
newly- arrived UNHCR-Iraq Head of Delegation Janvier de 
Riedmatten. 
 
¶3. Justification for short notice on country clearance 
request:  the May 11 meeting date has only just been 
determined based per ECHO availability.  Most 
participants are not available later due to commitments 
to attend UNRWA meetings.  As PRM's interlocutor to 
UNHCR-Iraq on Iraq funding issues, Baghdad RefCoord is a 
key player in the donor's meeting and needs to be 
present.  MILAIR return schedule offered a chance to 
combine the May 11 meeting with an introductory call on 
newly-arrived UNHCR-Iraq head of delegation, who will be 
Baghdad RefCoord's senior UNHCR interlocutor at UNHCR. 
 
¶4. Ms. Hill's proposed itinerary is as follows: 
 
May 10 depart Baghdad and arrive Amman on MILAIR 
May 11 - Meeting with UNHCR, ECHO, Amman RefCoord 
May 12 or 13 - Meeting with Janvier de Riedmatten 
May 14 - depart Amman for Baghdad on MILAIR 
 
¶5.  Ms. Hill holds a TS clearance. Ms. Hill will be 
traveling between Baghdad and Jordan on diplomatic 
passport no. 900347751.
