¶1. On April 7, Poloff delivered to Rebecca Lineham, Policy 
Officer, Americas Division, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
Trade, four surveys comprising a GAO questionnaire on 
unauthorized workers (reftel).  Lineham passed the surveys to 
New Zealand Immigration, where Mikaela Nyman, International 
Advisor - Strategic Support confirmed on April 21 that the 
Border Security Group (BSG) was working on the surveys. 
 
¶2. On April 24, Poloff received the first of the four 
surveys, the GAO Worksite Enforcement Survey, from the BSG, 
and forwarded that to EAP/ANP via e-mail.  Post has continued 
frequent follow up with BSG, Nyman and Lineham.  On May 23, 
BSG communicated that the surveys were complete, but had been 
forwarded to the Policy Section, New Zealand Immigration, for 
final review.  BSG expects to provide us the final product at 
the end of the week.
