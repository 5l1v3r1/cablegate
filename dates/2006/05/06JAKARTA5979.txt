REF: SECSTATE 46515 
 
Â¶1.  We contacted Indonesian Air Force Procurement Control 
Officer Major Yusran Lubis on April 6 to verify whether the 
Air Force ordered C-130 spare parts through Glamco Aviation 
(Glamco) located in Singapore.   According to Major Lubis, 
the Air Force did not request the order through Glamco.   He 
noted that Glamco was a regular supplier for the Air Force 
prior to 2000, but that the organization has not had a 
contract with Glamco since that time.
