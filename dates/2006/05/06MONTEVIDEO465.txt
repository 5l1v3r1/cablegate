REF:  MONTEVIDEO 448 	
 	
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  On May 24 in Buenos Aires, the four 	
Mercosur countries and Venezuela agreed on a draft 
document detailing the necessary steps for Venezuela's 
entry into the trading bloc.  While Venezuela will have to 
adopt the Common External Tariff (CET) within four years, 
it will be allowed to join as a full member once the 
document just negotiated is signed and ratified by all 
five parliaments.  This could presumably occur way before 
the four-year CET deadline, thus giving Venezuela full 
membership without having complied with all of the 
obligations. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Meanwhile in Montevideo, Uruguayan EconMin Astori 
reacted angrily to warnings to Uruguay by the Argentine 
and Brazilian foreign ministers about signing trade 
agreements outside of Mercosur.  Astori railed against the 
double-standards and "imperialist" tendencies of his 
neighbors, whose attitude had "exceeded all limits".  All 
is not well within Mercosur, although Chavez is getting 
his way.  End Summary. 
 
¶3. (U) According to the negotiated deal, Venezuela will 
have to subscribe to the Treaty of Asuncion, the Protocol 
of Ouro Preto and the Protocol of Olivos, and will have 
four years within which to adopt Mercosur norms and the 
Common External Tariff (CET).  Sensitive products would 
benefit from a transition period until between 2010 and 
2014, depending on the country.  While Chavez celebrated 
in a Caracas press conference the accession of Venezuela 
to a "new Mercosur", the Argentine MFA released a 
disclaimer to rectify a previous statement claiming that 
Venezuela was now a full member.  The new statement 
specified that the draft agreement had not yet been 
signed", as earlier stated, but that only a text "had 
been agreed upon". 
 
¶4. (U) In a press interview, the Uruguayan MFA negotiator 
also threw some cold water on Chavez's boisterous claims. 
He clarified that the draft document did not hold legal 
validity until approved by the governments and parliaments 
of the four current members.  "There is a whole mechanism 
that will begin to take place no earlier than 2007," this 
MFA official was quoted as saying.  "We still need 
annexes, ratification documents, a lot of things."  Still, 
the document is expected to be signed by all five 
countries in July at the Cordoba Summit for the change of 
presidency. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Another participant from the Uruguayan MFA 
provided us with inside details of the negotiations. 
Chavez had applied strong pressure through a barrage of 
phone calls, he said, and both Brazil and Argentina had 
also pressed hard for a deal to emerge quickly.  The 
Venezuelans had opened up with their expected proposal for 
immediate full membership (reftel).  The final compromise 
deal at least obligates them to adopt the CET within four 
years.  Still, Venezuela will be able to gain full 
membership once the text is signed and ratified by the 
five parliaments.  It is quite possible then, if such 
ratification takes place quickly, that Venezuela could 
become a full member before having adopted the CET. 
According to the MFA official, Venezuela will also be able 
to participate in all of Mercosur's external trade 
negotiations from the time of signature of the document. 
Along with the pressure, a ""sweetener"" was thrown in to 
gain Uruguay and Paraguay's approval for the deal, our 
contact told us, in that a list of specific products from 
these countries will be allowed to gain immediate duty- 
free access to the Venezuelan market. 
 
¶6. (U) Meanwhile in Brasilia, Argentine ForMin Taiana 
reportedly reiterated that Mercosur statutes prohibit 
members from signing bilateral trade agreements with third 
parties.  Asked about Uruguay's stated intentions to 
negotiate several free trade agreements (FTA), Taiana said 
that this initiative "would be considered in the plenary", 
in reference to the July Mercosur Summit in Cordoba for 
the change of presidency.  Taiana's statement comes a day 
after Brazilian ForMin Amorin was quoted in the Brazilian 
press as having warned Uruguay of the risk of "expulsion" 
if it negotiated trade agreements outside of Mercosur. 
 
¶7. (U) In Uruguay, EconMin Astori reacted strongly by 
defending his country's "new and fundamental decision of 
international economic insertion" through an expansion of 
trade relationships with the U.S., India and China.  Our 
policy is "absolutely legitimate, absolutely compatible 
with our belonging to Mercosur and a reflection of the 
necessity that a government obviously has to defend the 
national interest," Astori said.  He railed against "the 
bilateralism between Argentina and Brazil, to the 
detriment of the small economies of the region," and their 
imperialist attitude."  "The attitudes of Argentina and 
Brazil in Mercosur have exceeded all imaginable limits," 
Astori said, adding that a trade bloc "cannot accept that 
the two most economically powerful countries sign their 
own bilateral agreements, such as the recent competitive 
adaptation mechanism," and then prevent other members from 
pursuing their own interests by looking for other markets. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Comment:  It appears that Chavez got what he 
wanted from the Buenos Aires meeting.  The agreement may 
very well allow him to become a full member of Mercosur 
way before he has to take the bitter pill of adopting the 
CET if, as is likely, the parliaments from all five 
signatory countries ratify the agreement in short order. 
This gigantic "hole" in the Mercosur's CET would make 
Uruguay's request for an FTA waiver pale in comparison. 
The feeling of frustration from the smaller Mercosur 
members cannot be understated, as they perceive that the 
trading bloc's rules that restrict them are made for the 
larger members to break.  The arrival of Venezuela on the 
scene is likely to increase this tendency.  Chavez is 
known for making his own rules.  End Comment.
