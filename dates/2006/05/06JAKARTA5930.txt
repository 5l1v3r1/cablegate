REF: STATE 66895 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) Indonesia does not formally comply with the Arab 
League Boycott of Israel.  Indonesians may travel to Israel 
with Indonesian passports but Indonesia does not have formal 
diplomatic relations with Israel.  There is no official data 
at the Ministry of Trade for trade with Israel, though it is 
possible that private merchants engage in informal trade. 
The American Chamber of Commerce told the Embassy that U.S. 
companies have experienced no official or informal requests 
to comply with the boycott.  There is no official obligation 
for Indonesian firms to comply with the boycott, though 
there is unwritten "Muslim solidarity" pressure to conform. 
Indonesia does not have a formal boycott law and does not 
maintain an Arab League Boycott office.
