REF: ABIDJAN 460 
 
(SBU) On Sunday, May 14 a group of unknown assailants 
attacked a truck owned by the logging company, Thanry, which 
is headquarted in Guiglo, killing two.  Nine other Thanry 
employees escaped from the attackers;  eight were later found 
by security forces, but one remains missing.  The attack 
occurred close to Thanry,s logging concession, just north of 
the village of Zouan, some 12 kilometers from Guiglo.  A 
contact at Thanry confirmed that the members of the crew were 
all of the Guere tribe, but he was not inclined to label the 
attack as an &ethnic killing.8  The stretch of road where 
the attack occurred is apparently known for banditry. 
However, on this occasion, neither the truck nor any 
equipment was taken.  Thanry,s management and the local 
defense and security forces are investigating.  Though the 
motivation is unclear, this attack, which follows another 
violent incident in the same area at the end of April 
(reftel), is another reminder that the West remains a 
dangerous and volatile region.
