¶1.  Summary: Syrian papers reported the visit to Damascus by 
Nabih Berri, Speaker of the Lebanese Parliament, and his 
separate meetings with President Asad and Vice President Faruq 
al-Shar'a. Berri briefed Asad and Shara on the results of the 
Lebanese national dialogue and status of relations between Syria 
and Lebanon. 
Papers also reported that Juergen Cain Kuelbel, German researcher 
and criminologist and author of "Hariri's Assassination: Hidden 
Evidence," delivered a lecture at Al-Asad National Library Sunday 
evening. During the lecture, Kuelbel touched upon evidence and 
details he documents in his book, saying, "I discovered part of 
the international conspiracy behind the crime that claimed the 
life of Lebanese ex-premier Rafik al-Hariri," the criminologist 
said. He pointed out that the crime preceded a plot to destroy 
the historic ties connecting Syria and Lebanon. "Syria is 
innocent and has nothing to do with that crime or the other 
assassinations," the German writer underlined, indicating that 
assassinations in Lebanon have their roots in the Lebanese civil 
war and the Israeli occupation and its crimes in the country. 
"Israeli intelligence stands behind this crime," the 
criminologist noted, clarifying that the jamming equipment used 
by the former Lebanese premier's convoy was out of order an hour 
before the assassination. "No one can do that but the central 
network that controls the electronic system of the equipment" he 
added, suggesting that Israel is the only party that has such 
capabilities. The lecture was attended by the Ministers of 
Expatriates, Labor and Social Affairs, and Culture, along with a 
number of Arab and Foreign ambassadors to Syria. 
 
End of summary.

¶3. Editorial Block Quotes: 
 
----------------------- 
 
"Distribution of Roles" 
 
----------------------- 
 
 
Ahmad Dawwa, an editorialist in government-owned Al-Thawra, 
wrote (5/8) "Samir Ja'ja, leader of the Lebanese Forces party, 
called for keeping Lebanon away from the Arab-Israeli 
conflict.... People like Ja'ja and Walid Jumblatt want to 
isolate Lebanon from its Arab environment in favor of Israel's 
control and hegemony.... 
 
 MSI3002B NO E.O. LINE  DETECTED OR INVALID EO LINE SECTION 0002 
 
"We wonder how such calls could be made when Israel is still 
occupying Lebanese territories and detaining dozens of 
Lebanese.... 
 
"Such calls have two objectives: Taking Lebanon back to the 
Israeli camp and igniting civil war. Differences over these 
issues within the Lebanese society are enormous and no accord 
over them can be reached.... 
 
"Coming days will reveal further details and connections. But 
there are Lebanese forces that are alert to what is being 
concocted against Lebanon in American and Israeli circles. They 
will not allow Lebanon to turn into an Israeli pawn or to sign a 
new 17 May agreement."

"Who Compensates the Victims?" 
 
----------------------------- 
 
Izz-al-Din al-Darwish, an editorialist in government-owned 
Tishreen, wrote (5/8): "The United States blesses Israel's 
deadly starvation siege on Palestinians and uses its influence, 
as the world's superpower, to tighten this siege and prevent any 
country from breaking it, even through the transfer of 
humanitarian financial donations for the Palestinian people.... 
 
"We wonder if any earthly or divine law allows such a siege...? 
How can anyone in his right mind believe the Bush administration 
when it says that it cares about human rights, democracy, 
security, and peace...? 
 
"The US Administration has created a deep gulf between the 
United States and the rest of the world, particularly Arabs and 
Muslims, and pushed the world to hate the United States.... 
 
"Americans have realized why the world is moving away from them. 
They are preparing to call their administration to account, 
either directly or through the next elections. But the question 
remains: Who will compensate the victims of this administration 
from among Palestinians, Iraqis, Afghanis, Iranians, and others 
on the long list...?" 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
"An International Consortium Is the Solution" 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
Ali Nasrallah, an editorialist in government-owned Al-Thawra, 
commented (5/8): "Iran's proposal to enrich uranium under the 
supervision of an international consortium is an adequate way 
out of the crisis of the Iranian nuclear program. 
 
"The Iranian proposal provides a golden opportunity that the 
international powers that sincerely seek a peaceful solution 
should seize, to embarrass the United States and put an end to 
its excuses. 
 
"The Iranian proposal entails much flexibility and reflects 
Iran's eagerness to find a solution to the crisis.... 
 
"Tehran's acceptance of a consortium to supervise uranium 
enrichment is a strong message in all directions. It strengthens 
the positions of China and Russia, which reject the principle of 
sanctions or the use of force. It backs the United States, 
France, Britain, and Germany into a corner. It also reduces 
 
Washington's ability to apply pressure on Beijing and 
Moscow...."
