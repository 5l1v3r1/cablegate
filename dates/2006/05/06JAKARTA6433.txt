Bill:  Thanks for making Ed Smith and his APCSS team 
available to us.  The seminar they facilitated on NSC process 
went extremely well.  Defense Minister Juwono and I opened 
the week-long program and the Minister participated later in 
the week.  The seminar, with representatives from 23 
different departments, agencies and civil society, produced a 
concrete product on the design of a prospective Indonesian 
NSC which Minister Juwono will consider and present to 
President Yudhoyono.  If all goes well, it should provide the 
basis for a much-needed body to coordinate foreign and 
security policy within the GOI.  The APCSS visit just prior 
to the Secdef's visit was a very useful reminder of our 
expanded military-to-military relationship and its potential 
for further development.  Thanks again for making the visit 
possible.  Regards, Lynn
