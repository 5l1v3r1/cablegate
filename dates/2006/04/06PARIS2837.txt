Paris Launches Information Campaign 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶1.  On April 24, Minister of Health Bertrand announced France's new 
public awareness campaign to minimize the impact of a potential 
avian influenza pandemic.  The campaign called, "Adoptons les gestes 
qui nous protegent," translated as, "Taking the steps that will 
protect us," will debut in May.  The campaign will target both the 
general public and health practitioners.  As part of this campaign, 
the GOF has adopted a color-coded system to notify the French public 
of threat levels and corresponding precautions to take. 
 
¶2.  Threat Level Green:  The first alert level, represented by the 
color green, signifies a threat of common respiratory viruses, such 
as the flu and colds season.  In this condition, people are reminded 
to follow three simple rules: to wash hands for at least 30 seconds 
before preparing food, on leaving the lavatory, and when returning 
home; to dispose of used tissues in the trash; and to wear a mask 
when sick with respiratory ailments. 
 
¶3. Four million leaflets and posters will be distributed in 
hospitals, medical offices, and to different public sectors starting 
in May.  In September, the GOF will begin distributing information 
kits and masks to schools.  Beyond this, the GOF also plans to 
purchase space in the media to diffuse the message. 
 
¶4.  Threat Level Orange: This second alert level will signify the 
presence of avian influenza in domestic poultry.  The public 
campaign will again use national and regional media to publicize 
messages concerning the handling of poultry. 
 
¶5.  Threat Level Red: This final alert level will signify that a 
pandemic of the avian influenza has reached France.  Although the 
response to this level is still being developed, Minister Bertrand 
noted that 500 million surgical masks will be available by this 
summer, and distributed freely in the event of a pandemic. 
 
¶6.  Messages to Health Practitioners:  The second part of the new 
awareness campaign is directed at health professionals to ensure 
they receive the same information.  Some 400,000 'prevention kits' 
will be sent to hospitals and doctors.  Each kit contains a CD-ROM 
detailing what would need to be done in the event of a pandemic, as 
well as two masks for demonstrational purposes: one type FFP2 (N95) 
for respiratory risks and one surgical. 
 
¶7.  Medical Field Skeptical:  Soon after the Health Minister 
announced the new public information campaign, France's union of 
generalist doctors complained the plan of action was "utopic." 
Specifically, the union criticized the government's plan to offer 
informational training classes for doctors and health professionals 
from June to December of this year.  To prepare the entire health 
sector for a pandemic would require a massive training effort.  The 
union is concerned the government will lack the resources for such 
an ambitious undertaking.

More Dead Swans 
------------------ 
 
¶8.  Two dead swans, discovered this past weekend in the department 
of Ain in France's south, tested positive for H5N1.  A seven km 
protection zone has been established in this area.  Since January, 
France has tested 14,000 dead wild birds.  Sixty-four of them tested 
positive for H5N1.  While 63 were found in the same department of 
Ain, one was found in a neighboring department Bouches-du-Rhone.
