SUBJECT: DENMARK: INDEPENDENT INQUIRY COMMITTEE FOLLOW-UP 
 
REF A: 05 Copenhagen 1944  REF B: STATE 40495 
 
¶1. (U) 22 Danish firms were named in the final report of the 
Independent Inquiry Committee (IIC) on the Oil-for-Food 
Program (OFF) as having been involved in illicit OFF-program 
payments.  Ref A describes the initial Danish response to 
the report. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In response to Ref B, post followed up with the 
Public Prosecutor for Serious Economic Crime (PPSEC), which 
is currently investigating all Danish firms mentioned in the 
IIC report.  PPSEC investigators went to New York in the 
beginning of February 2006 in order to access the IIC files. 
PPSEC Director Henning Thiesen told Emboff that relevant 
documents were brought back to Denmark and are part of the 
investigation.  Thiesen observed that the PPSEC is in a race 
against time as a statute of limitations applies to the 
approximately 80 contracts that are under investigation. 
PPSEC is working with the European Union's Judicial 
Cooperation Unit (Eurojust) in The Hague concerning 
coordination of OFF investigations within the EU. 
 
¶3. (U) On March 29, 2006, Thiesen publicly announced that 
the PPSEC had decided to charge "a number of Danish 
companies" in connection with illicit OFF trading.  At least 
three Danish firms, Novo Nordisk, Leo Pharma, and FLSmidt, 
have been charged and more names may be announced in the 
coming days.  By raising formal charges, the PPSEC can 
ensure that the cases are not statute-barred. 
 
¶4. (U) Thiesen clarified to Emboff that PPSEC has not yet 
indicted any companies or individuals.  All cases continue 
to be investigated, and it is unclear how long the 
investigation will take.  NOTE: The office of the 
PPSEC consists of a police division and a prosecution 
division.  The police division investigates allegations and 
raises charges, i.e., the step that has already been taken. 
Upon completion of any additional investigation necessary in 
a case, the police division will pass it to the prosecution 
division which, examining relevant law and evidence, decides 
whether or not to recommend indictment.  Thiesen himself has 
the final word.  END NOTE. 
 
¶5. (U) Post will monitor and report further developments.
