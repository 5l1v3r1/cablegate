¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  The GOE has actively blocked indigenous 
protesters from marching in provinces under a state of 
emergency declaration, arresting leaders and preventing 
concerted movement of protesters to the capital.  FENOCIN, 
the indigenous campesino group, announced 7,000 protesters 
will converge on the capital by April 5-6.  As of early April 
5, less than 100 had arrived.  The larger indigenous 
organization, CONAIE, continues to threaten nationwide 
disturbances, reportedly set for mid-April unless the GOE 
agrees to put the FTA to referendum.  Potential effects of 
the protests on GOE stability will be described SepTel.  End 
Summary. 
 
Old Arrests, New Arrests 
------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (U) On April 3, authorities released FENOCIN leader Pedro 
de la Cruz, from custody in Canar province.  He had been held 
since March 31 for violating provisions against assembly 
under the state of emergency by attempting to march with 150 
anti-FTA protesters toward Quito.  Also on April 3, police in 
Imbabura province, also under state of emergency rules, 
arrested leaders of another FENOCIN group of approximately 
200 attempting to march toward Quito from the north.  On 
April 4, police detained FEINE leader Marco Murillo and 11 
others leading a march of 350 towards Quito from Cotopaxi 
province. 
 
¶3.  (U) On April 4, FENOCIN leaders declared their intention 
to continue their efforts to congregate up to 7,000 
protesters in the capital on April 5.  Few of those 
protesters had arrived by early April 5. 
 
CONAIE Threatening Nationwide Protests 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (U) In a March 31 assembly meeting of several hundred 
CONAIE leaders in Salasaca (Ref A), CONAIE leaders reportedly 
decided to initiate new nationwide protests after the Holy 
Week holidays, beginning the week of April 16. Later, the 
group added a new demand, calling for GOE respect for the 
hydrocarbon law passed March 30. 
 
GOE Actions 
----------- 
 
¶5.  (U) On April 3, Government minister Felipe Vega publicly 
characterized prospective protests as having electoral 
motives and involving a minority of the indigenous 
population.  He also accused CONAIE leader Luis Macas of 
causing serious economic damage to the country. 
 
¶6.  (U) Defense Minister Oswaldo Jarrin told the press on 
April 4 that the armed forces would enforce state of 
emergency measures, including limitations on freedom of 
assembly, in the 5 provinces affected (Canar, Imbabura, 
Chimborazo, Cotopaxi) and parts of Pichincha.  (Note: Quito, 
the capital of Pichincha province, is not under emergency 
restrictions.)  Jarrin emphasized that the emergency decree 
protects the right of the majority from disruptions by a 
lawless minority. 
 
Quito Relatively Quiet, Blockages Expected in Provinces 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
¶7.  (U) As of early April 5, Quito remained calm, with the 
number of protesters present in the gathering point of 
Arbolito park numbering in less than one hundred.  Organizers 
declared the bulk of the protesters would arrive on April 6 
for a national assembly on the FTA to be held in the park. 
Students at Quito's Central University were also reportedly 
organizing anti-FTA activities early on April 5.  Police 
expect new road blockages by protesters in Cotopaxi and 
Imbabura provinces. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶8.  (U) Unprecedented preventive measures implemented by 
police and the military in the state of emergency zone have 
hampered FENOCIN and FEINE marchers, delaying and possibly 
crippling this week's protests in the capital.  As a result, 
the bulk of these protesters are now expected to shift their 
focus from the capital to blocking roads in their provinces. 
With most of the provincial demands which underpinned the 
earlier wave of indigenous mobilization resolved, and with 
Holy Week beginning on April 8, widespread anti-FTA protests 
are not likely to start in earnest until the week of April 
¶16.  CONAIE's addition of the hydrocarbon law to its list of 
demands is a negative development, and could affect Palacio's 
willingness to reverse this disastrous law.
