SUBJECT: NICARAGUAN MEDIA TRUMPETS FIRST HEARING IN PANAMA MONEY LAUNDERING CASE AGAINST ALEMAN 
 
 ¶1.  (U) The March 30 preliminary hearing in the Panamanian 
money laundering case against ex-President Arnoldo Aleman, 
ex-Director of Taxation Byron Jerez and several of their 
family members and associates made banner headlines in the 
national media on March 31.  Through elaborate money 
laundering schemes, these individuals stole tens of millions 
of dollars from the Nicaraguan state during the Aleman 
administration (1997-2002).  The previous day's local media 
had focused on the last-minute removal of the original judge 
from the case.  These reports focused on credible allegations 
that Byron Jerez paid bribes to remove the judge and to 
convince the replacement judge to drop all charges against 
him. 
 
¶2.  (U) On March 31, the Nicaraguan media focused on the 
substance of the March 30 preliminary hearing, noting the 
wealth of evidence presented by Panamanian prosecutors--23 
large tomes containing over two thousand different documents. 
 The media also highlighted the emphasis of AlemanQ,s defense 
attorneys on spurious technical arguments, without any effort 
to deny that the money laundering took place.  The papers 
also noted that both JerezQ,s lawyers and ex-Treasury 
Minister Esteban Duque Estrada have now argued that Aleman 
was the key figure in the entire money laundering scheme, 
while all the other players were only obeying his orders. 
Finally, local media emphasized that Panamanian prosecutors 
asked the judge to issue arrest warrants for Aleman, Jerez, 
and AlemanQ,s wife and father-in-law, among others. 
 
¶3.  (U) In typical fashion, the PLC continues to reject all 
accusations and evidence against Aleman as politically 
motivated.  National Assembly Wilfredo Navarro stuck to the 
party line on March 30, claiming that no evidence exists 
against Aleman and blaming the Bolanos administration and the 
USG for "orchestrating" the trial against Aleman in Panama. 
During a weekend press interview of presidential-hopeful Jose 
Rizo, when he was queried about his views on AlemanQ,s 
corruption, he quipped, "What corruption?"  AlemanQ,s 
strategy throughout has been to deny all evidence, no matter 
how obvious or overwhelming, and to try to delay or block 
progress in the Panama case by every possible means. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) We understand that the Panamanian substitute judge 
will now have over a month to decide whether Aleman, Jerez, 
or anyone else should go to trial in the money laundering 
case.  If Jerez has indeed bought his exoneration in advance, 
it remains to be seen whether the outcome will somehow clear 
Aleman as well, or pin exclusive responsibility on the 
ex-president.  (Comment:  Despite the delays and machinations 
of Aleman and cronies to derail the Panama case, even the 
fact that it is drawing extraordinary coverage here could 
generate considerable public sentiment against Aleman.  The 
news will have especially strong impact on the same day the 
PLC holds its mini departmental conventions to vote on its 
presidential candidate.  Post greatly appreciates Embassy 
Panama's efforts to emphasize the importance of due process 
in the Aleman/Jerez case to the Panamanian authorities, as 
well as Embassy Panama's formal and informal reporting on 
developments in the case.)
