SUBJECT: IMPROVED RELATIONS WITH U.S. ERODE CARICOM SUPPORT 
FOR VENEZUELA'S UNSC CANDIDACY 
 
REF: A. STATE 57503 
     ¶B. STATE 60604 
 
¶1.  DCM discussed Venezuela's candidacy for the UN Security 
Council with Marilyn Zonicle, MFA Acting Permanent Secretary, 
on April 19, conveying reftel points on Venezuela's 
unsuitability for a UNSC seat.  Zonicle reported that the 
Caribbean Community's foreign minister group, COFCOR, had not 
made a decision on the UNSC candidacies but would be 
discussing the issue at a foreign minister meeting in 
Bridgetown next week.  She believed that the member states 
would follow a CARICOM line once a consensus was reached. 
 
¶2.  DCM asked what impact Venezuela's PetroCaribe program 
would have on the voting, given the importance of the program 
to Jamaica and some Eastern Caribbean states.  DCM noted that 
Japan had previously been successful in using economic 
leverage to gain friendly positions from CARICOM countries on 
whaling issues.  Zonicle acknowledged that energy was an 
important economic issue for many CARICOM members, but argued 
that the scope of the foreign ministers' decision-making 
would be broader than energy or economic interests.  She 
stated that CARICOM foreign ministers were "more 
sophisticated now" and would not want to jeopardize the 
progress made during the Secretary's visit to Nassau in 
March.  CARICOM was impressed by the Secretary's commitment 
to relations with the region and grateful that she was able 
to facilitate a meeting with USTR Portman so soon after the 
Nassau Ministerial.  Zonicle said COFCOR sees the Secretary 
as an engaged and credible partner for the region whose 
opinion on Venezuela and other matters they will be hesitant 
to disregard.
