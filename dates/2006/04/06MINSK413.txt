¶1. The GOB has taken and almost certainly will not take any actions 
as a result of the Independent Inquiry Committee (IIC) looking into 
Iraqi Oil-for-Food violations (ref A).  Post asked the MFA if there 
was any domestic investigation.  The MFA replied that this is a 
complicated situation, and that Post should submit an official, 
written request if its wants an answer. 
 
¶2. Most of the Belarusian entities mentioned in the IIC report are 
GOB-owned.  This includes Belpharm (a state monopoly provider of 
pharmaceuticals), Belmetalenergo, and Belneftekhim (a major state 
concern, which controls 40 major companies, responsible for 30% of 
Belarus' industrial output and 35% of all exports).  Lada-OMC is 
believed to be a partially state-owned joint venture.  Likewise, 
the IIC report refers to a "Mr. Leonic Kosak."  This refers to 
Leonid Kozik, who was Belarusian Prime Minister from 1998 to 2000, 
represented Belarus in the Belarus-Russia Union State from 2000 to 
2001, and was Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration and 
Deputy Prime Minister from 2001 to 2002.  He is now head of the 
state-controlled Federation of Trade Unions of Belarus and was 
recently placed on the list of Belarusian officials denied entry by 
the EU and its member countries.  The Belarusian Liberal-Democratic 
Party, named in the IIC report, also has very close ties with the 
Lukashenko regime.
