¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  On April 11, the front-page headline of 
the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported a second 
suspected bird flu case in Guangdong Province and a mainland 
news blackout on the subject.  Guangdong's only confirmed 
human AI death occurred on March 2.  Subsequent 
investigations by Consulates Guangzhou and Hong Kong 
revealed the suspected case to be negative.  The incident is 
an important reminder that media sources have their own 
interests.  Moreover, the Guangdong Foreign Affairs Office 
should be applauded for its relative timely response.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (U) The April 11 South China Morning Post (SCMP) 
headline read "News Ban for Guangzhou's Suspected Second 
Bird Flu Case, Sources Say".  The story was based on a 
source at the Guangzhou No. 1 People's Hospital, which said 
a 41-year old woman resident of Guangzhou municipality, Ms. 
Li, was admitted on March 25 with unexplained pneumonia. 
The SCMP reported that on March 30, the Ministry of Health 
informed the World Health Organization (WHO) in Beijing. 
Thus far local Guangdong media has not covered the issue at 
all.  Guangdong's only confirmed human AI death occurred on 
March 2 (Reftel C).  The victim was a Guangzhou resident in 
his 30s, who was known to frequent "wet market" (live animal 
markets) throughout Guangzhou. 
 
Reaction from Guangdong 
----------------------- 
¶3.  (SBU) Upon learning of the SCMP article, Post called its 
contacts Mr. Luo Jun, Deputy Director of the Foreign Affairs 
Officer (FAO) Consular Division, who has been our regular 
contact regarding AI issues and possible increased 
collaboration with U.S. experts (see ref B).  Luo said that 
the SCMP article was "not true."  Luo said he had spoken 
with Feng Shaomin, the Guangdong Health Department 
spokesman, who said the SCMP article was "made up."  Unlike 
in the earlier case of AI in March, Luo was diligent in 
returning Post's request via phone and text message. 
 
Reaction from Hong Kong 
----------------------- 
¶4.  (SBU) The Environmental, Science, Technology and Health 
(ESTH) Officer in Hong Kong also confirmed the negative test 
results with the Hong Kong Government (HKG).  The HKG 
official said that since Ms. Li tested negative for both 
H5N1 and SARS, the HKG considers the case "closed." 
 
Comment:  "Just the Facts Ma'am" 
-------------------------------- 
¶5.  (SBU) The recent SCMP article incident demonstrates the 
benefit of maintaining an objective view towards AI cases in 
South China.  While the SCMP merely reported the issue as a 
"suspected case," it and other media can also tilt toward 
sensationalism in their coverage.  Additionally, government 
officials can be timely and open with their replies.  It is 
encouraging that the Ministry of Health shared information 
about the case five days after the victim admitted to a 
hospital. 
 
¶6. (SBU) It is important to note there are a number of 
medical issues that make timely reporting difficult.  If a 
patient is not present at a hospital until after day 8, 
health officials may not be able to determine the disease 
until day 21.  The optimal time to test is between day 3 and 
day 5.  So there are a lot of cases that remain "suspect" 
until an anti-body test can be performed on day 21. 
 
¶7. (SBU) The problem in Guangdong is that distance from 
 
GUANGZHOU 00011683  002 OF 002 
 
 
Beijing's Central Government means bureaucrats in Guangdong 
must wait longer for official permission to report. 
Additionally, local officials are not allowed to reported 
cases until it has been confirmed and announced by the 
central government (this policy is considered reasonable by 
both the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and WHO).  In a 
recent special briefing for Consulate officials (reftel A), 
Guangdong Public Health officials actually stated that they 
are allowed to report even suspected cases to diplomatic or 
media officials.  This procedure has yet to be seen in 
practice.  Post will monitor how timely and open Guangdong 
officials are when they respond to future cases, especially 
when they are less confident about the facts of the case.
