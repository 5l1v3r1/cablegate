¶1.  The Jakarta Metro police destroyed a significant 
quantity of drugs, pornography, and bootleg CDs, VCDs, and 
DVDs at a contraband destruction ceremony on April 5. 
During the ceremony, the police incinerated more than 750 
kilograms of narcotics and 110,000 ecstasy tablets, and 
burned a large pile of pornographic magazines.  A 
steamroller then crushed more than 100,000 pornographic VCDs 
or DVDs and 1.5 million bootleg CDs, VCDs, and DVDs. Police 
estimate the total value of the destroyed discs at Rp. 6.6 
billion (USD 728 thousand). 
 
¶2.  Jakarta Police Chief Firman Gani presided over the 
ceremony, which he described as part of a police effort to 
combat drugs abuse, pornography and rampant optical disk 
(OD) piracy.  In his remarks at the ceremony, Firman Gani 
acknowledged that OD piracy is a rampant in Indonesia and 
noted that the international community has listed Indonesia 
as a "save haven" for IPR pirates.  He emphasized that the 
Jakarta police will continue to seriously implement measures 
to combat OD piracy.  The Jakarta Metro Police seized the 
bootleg discs from 372 suspects (including a factory owner 
and wholesale distributor) in raids from October 2005 to 
March 2006. 
 
¶3.  More than 20 representatives of the print and broadcast 
media attended the ceremony, along with representatives from 
the Directorate General for Intellectual Property Rights, 
Ministry of Industry, Attorney General's Office, Indonesian 
Motion Picture Association, the Recording Companies 
Association, and several prominent Indonesian recording 
artists.  The trucks that hauled the pirated discs to the 
destruction site in the Jakarta suburb of Tanggerang were 
festooned with signs declaring "By Buying Original Cassettes 
and DVDs, You Help Develop the Country and People by Paying 
Taxes." 
 
¶4.  Comment.  The contraband destruction ceremony was an 
effective public relations vehicle for getting a pro-IPR 
message out, and we expect it will receive wide media 
coverage.  It follows Indonesian National Police (INP) Chief 
Sutanto's widely publicized directive to regional INP 
offices to step up IPR enforcement, and is a sign that the 
GOI's IPR enforcement campaign remains very active.
