SUBJECT: DEMARCHE ON UN SHORTFALLS FOR AFGHANISTAN 
DELIVERED TO NORWAY 
 
REF: STATE 57541 
 
1.(SBU) On April 19, we delivered reftel points regarding 
financial shortfalls for election costs in Afghanistan to 
Anne Glad Fredriksen, Adviser in the MFA's Section for South 
Asian Affairs.  Fredriksen noted Norway's existing support of 
international efforts in Afghanistan, as evidenced by the 
forthcoming visit to Kabul of five Norwegian state 
secretaries (representing the MFA, the Ministries of Justice 
 
SIPDIS 
and Defense and the Prime Minister's Office).  Fredriksen 
would review whether Norway's budget for 2006 already 
included contributions for the Afghanistan-related financial 
shortfalls noted in reftel points.  She noted that the only 
roadblock which may prevent Norwegian contributions (if they 
have not yet been made) would be that the 2006 discretionary 
budget has recently been finalized.
