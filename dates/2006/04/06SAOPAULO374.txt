¶1. "Peruvian Elections" 
 
Liberal Folha de S. Paulo (4/6) editorialized: "The prospect of 
candidate Ollanta Humala being elected president in Peru is 
worrisome.  Although he presents himself as a leftist nationalist, 
it seems more correct to describe him as an ultranationalist with 
strong authoritarian trends. He promised to ban foreign companies 
from operating in 'strategic' sectors and to review fiscal 
incentives given to mining companies in addition to industrializing 
coca leaf production. Some analysts have accused him of hiding his 
true ideas, which are somewhat delusionary and even racist. They say 
that he plans to recreate the Inca Empire as democracy exclusively 
for indigenous and mestizo people. When in the military, Humala was 
involved in the violent repression of members of the also violent 
Maoist Shining Path guerrilla group.... If he actually wins, Humala 
will reach the power without any party structure to support him, as 
happened with his immediate predecessors Alberto Fujimori and 
Alejandro Toledo. And the combination of radical ideas with a weak 
political and institutional environment has never had a happy end." 
 
¶2. "Left And Right" 
 
Political analyst Demetrio Magnoli wrote in liberal Folha de S. 
Paulo (4/6): "Ollanta Humala has been openly praised by [Presidents] 
Hugo Chavez and Evo Morales, in addition to receiving discreet 
support from President Lula. The media is treating him as part of a 
'leftist wave' in Latin America. However, Humala is a rare species: 
he is what is closest to fascism in this part of the world.... 
Humala has recently begun waving the Bolivarian flag in his 
discourse. But this is an artificial element of a foreign policy 
vision of which the real 'Homeland' is an 'integration' of Peru and 
Bolivia into a state replacing the Inca Empire."
