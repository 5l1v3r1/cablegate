SUBJECT: THE GAMBIA: FURTHER  REPORT OF FIGHTING NEAR 
GAMBIAN BORDER WITH CASAMANCE 
 
REF: BANJUL 250 
 
¶1. (SBU) Reftel contains GOTG report of April 21 outbreak of 
violence, possibly involving forces of dissident MFDC 
commander Salif Sadio, in the Casamance region near the 
border with The Gambia. Subsequently, on April 25, a 
knowledgeable source, present in the Gambian village of 
Ndemba Jola, located near the Casamance village of Grande 
Kanao, reported hearing gunfire across the border in the 
Casamance "throughout the night" of April 24-25. The source 
believed that besides small arms fire, heavier weapons, 
e.g.,mortars, were used by the combatants. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On April 25, Pol/econ contacted official with 
Concern Universal, NGO assisting residents of Gambian 
villages along the border with Casmance, and asked about 
possible refugee flow resulting from the latest clashes. The 
official said he had gotten reports of "a few hundred" 
refugees entering The Gambia following April 21-22  fighting. 
 He added that, as yet there had been no push from the Red 
Cross for urgent assistance and cited the lack of such a 
request as an indication that the Red Cross and local 
authorities viewed the refugee influx in recent days as 
manageable. 
 
¶3. (SBU) COMMENT: We have been unable to reach knowledgeable 
GOTG officials today, April 25, to get their latest 
assessment of the border situation, but will continue our 
efforts to reach them.  END COMMENT
