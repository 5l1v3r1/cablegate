¶1.  (U)  Turkish MFA BMENA Coordinator Ambassador Omur Orhun 
briefed representatives from G-8 and BMENA embassies April 19 
on Turkey's preparations for a May 21-23 Democracy Assistance 
Dialogue (DAD) Intergovernmental Conference entitled 
"Empowering Women in Public Life."  Orhun stressed that the 
MFA, together with the State Minister for Women and Family 
Affairs Nimet Cubukcu, has designed the conference to crown 
the work of the two Istanbul DAD symposia on women's issues. 
While the two Istanbul events were organized by the Turkish 
NGO TESEV and emphasized civil society participation, the 
Ankara intergovernmental will focus on bringing together 
senior G-8 and BMENA government officials with civil society 
representatives. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Deliverable:  The GOT plans for the main deliverable 
of the intergovernmental conference to be a declaration or 
statement in support of the final statement emanating from 
the second Istanbul symposium.  The MFA, in consultation with 
the Women and Family Affairs Office, is preparing a concept 
paper to guide participating governments' thinking on a 
declaration.  According to the MFA, the concept paper will be 
distributed to governments and their Ankara representatives 
the week of April 24 and the process for arriving at a final 
declaration will be similar to that used by Italy during its 
DAD event cycle. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Participation:  Orhun said that invitations signed 
by FM Gul and Family Minister Cubukcu were sent to capitals 
in early March.  The GOT is hoping that ministers or their 
deputies from BMENA countries, and representatives of 
"appropriate rank" from G-8 countries, will attend.  The UN, 
OIC, EU, and OECD have also been invited.  Orhun was 
concerned the MFA had received few replies to date.  Of the 
BMENA invitees, only Iraq, Syria, and Yemen have confirmed 
attendance at the minister level.  Senior UN officials 
(CEDAW, SYG's Special Advisor for Gender Issues, and Director 
of the UN Department on Women's Development) have regretted; 
the GOT is encouraging them to send deputies.  The OIC has 
promised to send a senior cultural affairs official.  The GOT 
had invited Palestinian President Abbas to send a "personal 
representative," but thus far has received no reply.  (A 
Palestinian diplomat attended the briefing). 
 
¶4.  (U)  FM Gul and State Minister Cubukcu will make opening 
speeches at the conference and will host a dinner for 
delegations the evening of May 22. 
 
¶5.  (U) Orhun hoped that G-8 and BMENA countries would 
confirm their delegations' participation as soon as possible. 
 The MFA asked to be informed in advance if delegation heads 
plan to make a presentation during the May 22 plenary session 
and if there are any special equipment needs. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) After the briefing, Orhun told us privately he 
hoped the U.S. would encourage the participation of G-8/BMENA 
states in the May conference.  He added that the GOT is also 
planning a DAD coordination meeting on the margins of the 
conference, to include DAD co-sponsors, the U.S., UK, and 
lead NGOs.
