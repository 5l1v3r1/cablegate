REF: STATE 53503 
 
 ¶1.  (U)  Global Affairs officer delivered points in reftel 
demarche April 6 to Hans-Peter Hofmann, Head of the MFA 
Taskforce on Environmental and Biopolitical Issues and to 
Oliver Lorenz, desk officer for North America in the same 
department.  Hofmann replied the German Ministry of 
Environment (BMU) has the lead on the Aarhus Convention and 
is representing Germany at the April 5-7 meeting in Geneva. 
Hofmann said he was unaware of any consultation on the German 
position between the BMU and MFA prior to the Geneva meetings. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Lorenz added that he had heard of some ongoing 
discussion between the BMU and other parts of the German 
government regarding the access rights of NGOs to 
international environmental fora.  Although he did not have 
details, he said the general tenor of the discussion was also 
one of concern about the implications of NGO presence. 
Hofmann told Global Affairs officer he would communicate 
demarche points to the BMU and the German representative at 
the Geneva meeting and would provide a more throrough 
explanation of the German position on the issue as soon as 
possible. 
 
¶3.  (U)  Global Affairs officer repeatedly tried to 
communicate demarche points to BMU, but relevant staff were 
unavailable or had already departed Germany for the Aarhus 
Convention meeting in Geneva.
