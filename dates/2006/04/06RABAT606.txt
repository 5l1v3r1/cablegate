¶1.  This cable is sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect 
accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On April 4, DCM met with Ambassador Youssef Amrani, 
MFA Director-General of Bilateral Relations, to deliver 
reftel demarche.  Amrani's immediate response to the demarche 
was that the USG's position on the conferences is very 
similar to the European Union's (EU) position.  Amrani did 
not provide further substantive response but took US points 
on board and promised to relay them to his superiors. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In response to the request (reftel par. 3) that the 
Moroccan press refrain from negative rhetoric, Amrani stated 
emphatically that there is no anti-Algerian press any longer 
and that such language would not be used in the future.
