INTERIOR MINISTER'S UPDATE 
--------------------------- 
¶1. (SBU) In April 26 conversation, Ambassador asked Interior 
Minister Baboucar Jatta about situation along The Gambia's 
border with Senegal's Casamance region, following recent 
reports of fighting -- most recently during night of April 
24-25 -- in that area, involving forces of dissident MFDC 
commander Salif Sadio (refs a and b).  Jatta said that, 
judging from reports by Gambian authorities in the border 
area, the area was presently calm and that, in any event, 
none of the recent violence had spilled over into Gambian 
territory.  He attributed the violence to clashes between 
"moderate" MFDC elements and Sadio's forces. Jatta said the 
GOTG was coordinating with the Red Cross on assistance to 
refugees entering The Gambia as a result of the recent 
incidents, but he could give no estimate of number of 
refugees. 
 
SAFETY OF PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEERS 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) In discussion with Interior Minister Jatta, 
Ambassador flagged our concern for the safety of the three 
Peace Corps Volunteers (PCV) serving in Gambian villages near 
the Casamance border area where the latest clashes occurred. 
At Ambassador's request, Jatta said GOTG would advise us of 
any reports of violence spilling over into The Gambia. (NOTE: 
We have checked on the status of the three PCV's and all are 
safe. Mission security personnel will travel to PCV's 
villages April 27 for site assessment.  END NOTE) 
 
NGO SOURCE 
---------- 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Official with Concern Universal, NGO working in 
Gambian villages near the Casamance border, told us April 26 
of a growing refugee flow into The Gambia due to the 
fighting, estimating at 400 to 600 the total number arriving 
since April 21.  Whereas the Concern Universal rep had 
previously indicated to us that the refugee influx was not of 
such magnitude as to require urgent assistance, he now 
acknowledged heightened concern on this score. He undertook 
to keep us informed of the evolving refugee situation along 
the Gambian/Casamance border. 
 
TREATMENT OF WOUNDED "MODERATE" MFDC ELEMENTS 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Gambian police sources informed us that, at 
Senegalese authorities' request, five or six "moderate" MFDC 
elements wounded in the clashes with Sadio's fighters had 
been brought to Banjul and were currently being treated at 
the city's main hospital.
