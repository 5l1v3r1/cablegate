SUBJECT: RUSSIAN BANKER BABENKO'S PRISON TIME EXTENDED; 
AWAITS ASYLUM AND/OR EXTRADITION 
 
REF: 05 VILNIUS 949 
 
¶1. A Vilnius court extended the imprisonment of former 
Russian banker Igor Babenko for three months on April 7. 
After the Vilnius court ruled on September 8, 2005, to 
extradite Babenko (reftel), the Migration Department 
subsequently granted asylum status on January 30.  The 
Prosecutor General appealed the asylum and Babenko will 
remain in prison for three months pending the outcome of the 
appeal. The appeals court began hearing the case on April 11. 
 
 
¶2. Russia requested Babenko's extradition to pursue 
allegations that he laundered USD 12 million of Yukos-owned 
Menatep Bank funds.
