¶1. (SBU) DCM and Econ Counselor made points reftel to DFAIT 
Assistant Deputy Minister Peter Boehm, Susan Fountain Smith, 
Director, Brazil, Southern Cone and InterAmerican Affairs, 
and Deputy Director Leonard Beaulne. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Our contacts responded that they see a "lot of 
agreement" on the agenda for the OAS Workshop on Cultural 
Diversity and assured us that they look forward to achieving 
consensus on the agenda.  Beaulne observed that the current 
draft agenda is very broad and does not specifically refer to 
the UNESCO Convention and that they agree that we should keep 
it that way; specifically, he said that Canada "would not 
support a specific agenda item on UNESCO" in the Workshop. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Beaulne said that he had consulted with Canadian 
Heritage official Artur Wilczynski, Director for 
International Relations and Outreach,who will participate in 
the April 26 conference call on the agenda, and had passed on 
our views.
