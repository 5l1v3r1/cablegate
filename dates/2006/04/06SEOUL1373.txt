Per REF A, poloff spoke, on April 24, with Chu Cheol-wan, 
Deputy Director of the Central America and Carribbean 
Division, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MOFAT), on 
the relationship between Cuba and the ROK.  Chu stated that 
the ROK did not have any business investments in Cuba and 
that the two governments had not signed any trade agreements 
(see REF B).  Through MOFAT's Korea International Cooperation 
Agency (KOICA), the ROKG's international assistance arm, 13 
Cubans have come to Korea for job training between 1991 and 
¶2005.  No Cubans are scheduled to come to the ROK in 2006. 
The ROKG has continously supported the U.S.-led resolution on 
human rights in Cuba since 1989.  There have not been any 
high-level diplomatic visits between Cuba and the ROK in the 
past six months.
