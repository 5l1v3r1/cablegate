¶1. (SBU) Summary:  According to Moshe Kam of the Institute 
of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), less than 
10,000 of the Institute's 370,000 members world-wide are 
from China.  With more and more electrical and electronic 
engineering projects being pursued through global 
partnerships and arrangements in a Thomas Friedmanesque 
"The World Is Flat" environment, it is essential for 
Chinese engineers to obtain internationally recognized 
certification of high professional standards so that 
Chinese companies can engage in more of these collaborative 
projects, Kam said.  Guangzhou authorities acknowledged the 
gap between China and the highly developed world in this 
respect and pledged to do their best to qualify and involve 
a greater number of local engineers and students in IEEE 
membership activities.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Dr. Moshe Kam, Board Member, Vice President of 
the IEEE for Educational Activities, and Chairman of the 
Institute's Educational Activities Board is currently 
passing through Guangzhou, the first stop in a China trip 
that will take him also to Shanghai and Beijing.  In a 
Easter Day meeting with Guangzhou Communist Party Secretary 
Lin Shushen, Kam noted the high reputation of the IEEE 
internationally, with most of its members still coming from 
the United States and Europe.  The mission of IEEE is not 
only to build and maintain high technical standards and the 
expertise of its members but also to reinforce strong 
ethical norms and to promote environmental protection in 
electrical and electronics engineering projects. 
 
"The World Is Flat," But Not Many Chinese Engineers There 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
¶3.  (SBU) Of the IEEE's 370,000 members, less than 10,000 
come from China, and of the 70,000 world-wide student 
members, less than a handful are Chinese, Kam said.  It is 
especially important that more Chinese join the IEEE and 
obtain the professional certification that such membership 
entails, Kam emphasized.  More and more major electrical 
and electronic engineering projects, including those that 
determine international technical standards, are being 
pursued collaboratively and transnationally.  In such an 
environment, described very ably in Thomas Friedman's "The 
World Is Flat," collaborators and partners in one setting 
need to have confidence in the technical expertise and 
professional and ethical standards of engineers in another. 
IEEE wants to see an increasing number of Chinese 
electrical and electronics engineering companies engaged in 
such collaborations, and it was precisely with this 
likelihood in mind that the IEEE dispatched Kam on this 
mission. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Kam said that while IEEE has previously conducted 
seminars and meetings in China, these have almost 
invariably characterized by foreign experts lecturing or 
leading the discussions.  Kam said that he wants to work 
towards a situation in which IEEE-sponsored activities in 
China feature predominantly Chinese engineering 
professionals.  Kam also said that envisions a time when 
IEEE's District 10 (which covers Southeast and East Asia) 
will feature a Chinese chairman, who by dint of the 
position is also a board member of the IEEE. 
 
"We Want In" 
------------ 
¶5.  (SBU) After extolling the virtues of Guangzhou 
including as a major venue for future IEEE activities, Lin 
acknowledged that there was a major gap between the 
standards of Chinese engineers and those in the developed 
world.  That did not mean that Chinese engineers were any 
less knowledgeable technically than their developed world 
counterparts, but the absence of continuing re-education 
and international exchange opportunities limited the 
further development of expertise and skills among working 
electrical and electronics engineers.  He pledged the 
 
GUANGZHOU 00011781  002 OF 002 
 
 
Guangzhou's commitment to changing this state of affairs, 
and appointed South China University of Technology (SCUT) 
Acting President Chen Jiequn and Deputy Party Secretary in 
charge of science and education Fang Xuan to take the lead 
in showing Kam the present state of the city's and the 
province's electrical and electronic engineering education 
system and to seek ways for IEEE to raise technical 
expertise and professional standards.  Lin noted that his 
son, currently studying for his Ph.D. in electronic 
engineering at Drexel University with, not coincidentally, 
Professor Kam as his chief faculty advisor, had emphasized 
how important it was for Chinese engineers and students to 
make this jump into internationally recognized professional 
settings. 
 
Comment 
------- 
¶6.  (SBU) With a huge current and future installed electric 
power base and with major concentrations of electronics and 
electrical appliance manufacturers in Shenzhen, Guangzhou, 
Foshan, and elsewhere, Guangdong Province undoubtedly has a 
large number of electrical and electronics engineers. 
Similarly, the educational presence of SCUT and Zhongshan 
University not to mention branch campuses of Beijing 
University, Tsinghua, and other major national science and 
engineering schools suggests that there are an ample number 
of potential IEEE faculty and student recruits.  That being 
said, however, Huizhou, east of Guangzhou and home to a 
large number of domestic and international consumer 
electronics firms, can serve as a metaphor on the state of 
electronic engineer expertise in south China.  Huizhou- 
based manufacturers reportedly install more electronic 
motherboards into products than anywhere else in China. 
But only a miniscule percentage of these motherboards were 
designed in China, and few if any of the semiconductor 
subcomponents developed and manufactured there.  If South 
China is to make the leap into the leading international 
ranks in electrical and electronic engineering, places like 
Huizhou will need to have a lot more people who are genuine 
experts meeting high professional standards.
