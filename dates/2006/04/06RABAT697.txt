REF: STATE 52470 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Poloffs met April 10 with MFA Director of 
International Organizations and UN Affairs Nasser Bourita to 
discuss reftel request encouraging Moroccan participation in 
upcoming COESPU classes.  Poloff delivered to Bourita a copy 
of reftel points in non-paper format.  In response, Bourita 
explained that he was aware of COESPU's letter requesting 
Morocco to submit nominees and that the letter had indeed 
been sent to the appropriate military office for action. 
Bourita noted that the MFA is encouraging the military to 
participate in training events, such as COESPU, because he 
believes this is the "next generation" of policing 
capabilities.  Bourita explained that, as of April 10, his 
office had yet to be contacted by the Italian Embassy in 
Rabat on this subject. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On April 14 Poloff contacted Italian Embassy DCM 
Luca Fratini, who had met April 13 with MFA Bilateral Affairs 
Officer Karim Halim to discuss Moroccan participation in 
COESPU classes.  According to Fratini, Halim reported that he 
was working on putting together a list of participants. 
Fratini, however, explained to poloff that after his April 13 
meeting with Halim the Italian Defense Attache received a 
letter from the Moroccan Gendarmerie stating that they would 
not be participating in the upcoming COESPU classes.  Fratini 
said that his embassy is following this topic very closely 
and promised to pass any new information to us.  Post will 
report further responses septel.
