2000 Cartagena Protocol on the Prevention of Biological 
Risks and reported that the Government of Morocco (GOM) is 
currently engaged in the ratification process.  The Moroccan 
government is establishing an inter-ministerial "National 
Biosecurity Committee" whose remit and plan of action was 
set by the Prime Minister.  The Ministry of Environment is 
currently conducting a study for the establishment of a 
National Biosecurity Committee and related personnel.

type of biological threat nor of dual-use bio-scientific 
research "that do not conform with international ethics." 
Moroccan officials would be very interested in participating 
in discussions on the possible dual-use of bio-scientific 
research and would like to receive information on the 
American initiatives on this subject.
