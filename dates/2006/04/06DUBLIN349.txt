Committee's (IIC) investigation of three Irish companies 
implicated in the UN's Oil-for-Food (OFF) program scandal.

General to draft a formal letter to the Department of Justice 
(DOJ) Secretary General requesting an update on the status of 
the investigation.  He added that the DOJ has yet to respond, 
but is likely to refer the investigation to the national 
police and the Director of Public Prosecutions if the 
evidence is deemed to warrant further investigation. 
 
¶2.  The names of the three implicated Irish companies are as 
follows: 
--Bula Resources PLC. 
--Nycomed Imaging A.S.
