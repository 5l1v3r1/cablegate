SUBJECT: APRE LEADER INCHES CLOSER TO MONTEALEGRE 
 
REF: MANAGUA 0709 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli. Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
¶1.  (C) Alliance for the Republic (APRE) President/National 
Assembly Deputy Miguel Lopez Baldizon met with Ambassador on 
April 26 to discuss the feasibility of multi-party primaries. 
 He opined there is no longer sufficient time to arrange such 
primaries.  Further, given Liberal Constitutional Party (PLC) 
presidential candidate Jose Rizo's refusal to compete, Lopez 
believes their utility would be limited. 
 
¶2.  (C) Lopez Baldizon announced that APRE will hold internal 
primaries on April 30.  APRE's 52,000 members will vote in 
180 voting sites throughout Nicaragua for candidates for 
president, vice president, and national and departmental 
Assembly lawmakers, and PARLACEN deputies.  Although APRE has 
not obtained funding for the event, a number of members are 
contributing in kind to cover costs. 
 
¶3.  (C) He also shared that APRE is now inclined to ally with 
ALN candidate Eduardo Montealegre, rather than with the PLC, 
noting that he has reopened communication with Montealegre 
and will meet with him on April 27.  According to Lopez 
Baldizon, he had tried before to approach Montealegre, but 
the "door was not open," while the PLC has been willing to 
meet.  What convinced him the PLC is no longer an option is 
the fact that Aleman chose Rizo.  In his view, Rizo is 
untrustworthy, a weak leader who will be unable to counter 
Aleman or to lead the party away from him. 
 
¶4.  (C) To Ambassador's query regarding the relationship 
between APRE's and APRE presidential-hopeful Jose Antonio 
Alvarado's separate discussions with Eduardo Montealegre, a 
visibly annoyed Lopez Baldizon replied that Alvarado is 
negotiating "on his own" and does not represent APRE. 
Further, Lopez Baldizon is concerned that Alvarado will try 
to strike a deal with Montealegre which would entail 
Alvarado's choice for deputies, not APRE's.  He asserted that 
only deputy candidates participating in the April 30 
primaries will be eligible to represent APRE. 
 
¶5.  (C) Comment:  The political horse-trading and game of 
brinkmanship among Montealegre, Alvarado, and Lopez Baldizon 
is likely to continue until the clock runs out in May.  As 
planned, Lopez Baldizon and Montealegre met on April 27. 
According to Lopez Baldizon, Montealegre is cognizant that 
he, not Alvarado, represents APRE.  The three of them are 
scheduled to meet on May 2, hopefully to finalize an 
alliance.  Alvarado is expected to win APRE's presidential 
candidacy on April 30.  An APRE/Alvarado alliance with 
Montealegre should boost Montealegre and likely create a bump 
in his favor in the polls.
