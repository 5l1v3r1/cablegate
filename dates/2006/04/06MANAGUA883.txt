Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli. Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
(C) On April 20, Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Norman Caldera 
informed the Ambassador that the GON has succeeded in 
convincing fellow Central America Integration System (SICA) 
members El Salvador, Costa Rica, and Honduras to join 
Nicaragua in supporting Guatemala in its race with Venezuela 
for a non-permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council (UNSC). 
 However, SICA members Panama and Belize have not signed on 
to the initiative.  Caldera explained that, while Belize 
maintains border issues with Guatemala, Panama is waiting to 
see whether Mexico or Venezuela will agree to locate an oil 
refinery in Panama before it decides on its vote.
