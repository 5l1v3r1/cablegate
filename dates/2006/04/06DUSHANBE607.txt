SUBJECT: TAJIKISTAN'S SERENA HOTEL:  "OH, ALL RIGHT, WE'LL DO IT YOUR 
WAY" 
 
REF: DUSHANBE 0402 
 
¶1.  (U) Sensitive but unclassified.  Please handle accordingly. 
Not for public Internet. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) At an Aga Khan lunch March 31 for Deputy Prime 
Minister Gulomov, Aga Khan Resident Representative Munir Merali 
told the Ambassador senior levels at Aga Khan offices in Geneva 
have reconsidered their first reaction (ref) and have decided to 
comply with Dushanbe Mayor Obaidulloyev's and President 
Rahmonov's demand to tear down the historic building on the site 
of the new Serena Hotel in Dushanbe rather than use it as the 
basis for their new hotel.  They will replace it with an 
ultra-modern steel-and-glass mid-rise structure.  Merali said 
initial razing at the site had already begun, and he expected 
the mayor to issue the edict that supposedly required to destroy 
a historic building sometime during the week of April 3. 
 
¶3.  (U) Apart from the Serena, two other five-star hotels are in 
the works, and a third, though long-stalled, is not yet counted 
out.  The RusAl-financed Hyatt Regency has started preliminary 
site work in Komsomolskiy Park, and the temporary 
construction-office buildings are going up quickly.  The land 
has been cleared on Rudaki Avenue, a block from the current U.S. 
Embassy, for a 10-story, neo-Soviet-style hotel co-financed by 
the First Family's Orien Bank and the Turkish group, Kaynak. 
Further, city officials continue to insist the Indian-invested 
Crowne Plaza Hotel will begin construction this spring, although 
two-thirds of the land originally allotted for it has been 
reallocated to RusAl to build its new Dushanbe business 
headquarters. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) COMMENT.  Given Tajikistan's current state of economic 
development, and the enormous difficulty for international 
travelers to get to Dushanbe, there is absolutely no way that 
four -- yes, four -- five-star hotels can be economically 
profitable.  If they all survive, it could only be through 
generous economic subsidies, from whatever sources, for the 
foreseeable future.  END COMMENT. 
 
MORE TO COME 
 
¶5.  (U) During a government meeting on March 30, President 
Rahmonov gave orders to start plans for a new Parliament, new 
National Library, and new National Museum.  All are currently 
housed in historic buildings on Rudaki Avenue.
