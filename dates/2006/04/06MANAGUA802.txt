¶1. (U) Nicaragua's Supreme Electoral Council (CSE) released 
the final version of the 2006 Electoral Calendar after a 
period of consultation with Nicaragua's political parties 
(reftel).  The last version contains several date changes; 
the deadlines for many events have been pushed forward, while 
a few were delayed.  The following is a list of key dates 
indicated on the calendar: 
 
- May 12, 2006: Deadline to register alliances of political 
parties. 
 
- May 15, 2006: Official appointment of the members of the 
Departmental and Regional Electoral Councils. 
 
- May 30, 2006: Official appointment of the members of the 
Municipal Electoral Councils. 
 
- May 31, 2006: Presentation of presidential candidates. 
 
- June 2006: Verification of voter registry and change of 
voting district.  CSE will finalize verification on August 
7, 2006. 
 
- June 19, 2006: Final publication of official candidates. 
 
- August 6, 2006: Deadline to solicit a cedula (national ID 
card required for voting). 
 
- August 19, 2006: Formal opening of electoral campaign. 
 
- September 5, 2006: Deadline for the completion of requested 
cedulas or supplementary voting documents. 
 
- September 5, 2006: Deadline for inclusion of new voters in 
registry. 
 
- November 1, 2006: Formal close of electoral campaign. 
 
- November 5, 2006: Election Day and transmission of results 
to national computation center. 
 
- November 19, 2006: Publication of preliminary results. 
 
- December 2-11, 2006: Proclamation of winners (takes place 
after formal complaint/resolution process). 
 
- January 9, 2007: Inauguration of new President and National 
Assembly. 
 
¶2. (C) Comment: Most of the deadlines for registering 
alliances, parties and candidates were brought forward, 
forcing the parties to make decisions sooner.  Notably, the 
publication of preliminary election results was pushed back 
from November 6 on the first draft calendar (the day after 
the elections) to November 19.  The potential 14-day delay 
between Election Day and the release of preliminary results 
from the CSE will make "quick counts" from national 
observation groups all the more critical to avoid 
manipulation of the vote count by partisan elements in the 
CSE.
