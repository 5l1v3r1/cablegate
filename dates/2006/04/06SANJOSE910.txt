On the sidelines of a dinner hosted April 26 by the 
Ambassador for the incoming cabinet, Foreign 
Minister-designate and current U.N. Permanent Representative 
Bruno Stagno confirmed that Costa Rica will oppose Iran's 
candidacy for the Human Rights Council (the new government 
will take office May 8 and all foreign policy instructions 
are being vetted by the incoming minister).  Stagno noted the 
work underway in the Community of Democracies context and 
expressed support for it, while noting the consensus-based, 
decision-making nature of the Community.  Costa Rica has yet 
to define which countries it would support for the HRC, he 
said.
