SUBJECT:  Sudanese Gov't Inaction Prevents UN U/S Egeland 
Flight to Chad; Egeland to Proceed to Nairobi 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On April 3, the Sudanese government denied 
permission for UN Under Secretary General for 
Humanitarian Affairs Jan Egeland to travel to Nyala and 
Khartoum.  According to World Food Program Flight 
Operations Coordinator Nigel Sanders (protect), the 
Sudanese government did not respond to a UN request for a 
subsequent, alternate flight clearance, forcing 
cancellation of the planned Rumbek - Abeche, Chad flight 
scheduled for April 4. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Sanders noted that U/S General Egeland plans to 
travel from Rumbek instead to Nairobi, his next scheduled 
stop, on commercial aircraft on the evening of April 4 or 
on April 5.
