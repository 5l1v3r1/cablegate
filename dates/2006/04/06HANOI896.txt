UN Human Rights Council 
----------------------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) The DCM met April 19 with MFA International 
Organizations Department Acting Director General Vu Anh 
Quang to deliver reftel's points and letter from the 
Secretary to Foreign Minister Nguyen Dzy Nien.  Quang said 
 
SIPDIS 
that the MFA values U.S. viewpoints on multilateral issues 
such as human rights, arms control and economic development. 
The matter of membership on the UN Human Rights Council is 
no different, and Vietnam will take into consideration our 
presentation as it formulates its own position, he said. 
 
UNSC: Guatemala vs. Venezuela 
----------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) In response to the DCM's inquiry about whether 
Vietnam has come to a decision regarding Guatemala's and 
Venezuela's competing candidacies for a non-permanent UNSC 
seat (Refs B and C), Quang said that the MFA's IO Department 
is "leaning" towards supporting Guatemala, but that the 
final decision will have to be made by Vietnam's leadership. 
Should Vietnam support Guatemala, it would be with the hope 
that the United States will support Vietnam's own candidacy 
for non-permanent UNSC membership in 2008-2009. 
 
Next UN Secretary-General 
------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) On the subject of the next UN Secretary-General 
(Ref D), Quang noted that the leaders of ASEAN have thrown 
their support behind the candidacy of the ASEAN (Thai) 
candidate.  However, with other strong Asian candidates in 
the running, the ASEANs are also open to discussing this 
matter with other Asian countries to find the best Asian 
candidate.  Quang expressed his hope that the United States 
would also support an Asian candidate.  The DCM stressed our 
desire to find the best candidate possible, regardless of 
region.
