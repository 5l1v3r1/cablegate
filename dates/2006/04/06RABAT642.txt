SUBJECT: MOROCCO: U.S. NOT TO RUN FOR UN HUMAN RIGHTS 
COUNCIL 
 
REF: STATE 55461 
 
¶1. (SBU) A/Polcouns met April 10 with MFA Director of 
International Organizations and UN Affairs Nasser Bourita to 
deliver reftel message that the U.S. will not run for a seat 
on the new UN Human Rights Council this year. Bourita 
responded with a request for the U.S. to support Morocco's 
bid to be elected to the Council in the May 9 elections. 
Indeed, Bourita said, the GOM had been "reserving a seat" to 
support the U.S., but would now give its vote to Canada 
instead.  Morocco - as an Arab, Muslim, African, developing 
country - would have much to contribute to the new Council 
and would appreciate "public" USG support for its candidacy. 
A/Polcouns told Bourita she would convey the GOM request for 
USG support to Washington. 
 
¶2. (SBU) While he said he understood the reasons why the U.S. 
would not present a candidate this year, Bourita urged the 
USG to closely follow the Council's development.  "The first 
three years are critical," for the Council.  It would be a 
bad precedent if the new organization were merely the old 
Commission with a new name, Bourita emphasized.  Strong 
leadership was necessary to ensure that this new Council not 
fall into the same traps as the old Commission.  As the USG 
was a major proponent of the reforms and the new Council, the 
U.S. "needs to be present and have its vision reflected," at 
the beginning of the new process, said Bourita. 
 
¶3. (SBU) While Bourita said that the GOM largely agreed with 
the USG on modalities for the new Council, he described the 
"nuance" of difference with U.S. policy indicating the 
Moroccan desire to "bring countries into the fold," instead 
of excluding them, to ensure that they comply with 
international standards for human rights.  When asked for 
clarification, Bourita, who just returned from a visit to 
China with Minister Delegate Fassi Fihri, responded that the 
Moroccans had pledged "reciprocity" with China on being 
elected to the new Council.  It is important that countries 
such as China have their place on the Council, explained 
Bourita, to emphasize economic and social rights in addition 
to such rights as freedom of expression. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Bourita also noted Morocco's intent to oppose the 
inclusion of the Western Sahara on any Council agenda because 
such discussion would not have anything to do with the 
mandate of the new body.  It is not appropriate to "bring a 
resolution from New York to have it adopted in Geneva," said 
Bourita.  It is not efficient to have the same discussions in 
both locales and Bourita emphasized that the GOM would work 
to ensure that the new Council not rehash issues already 
being discussed in the UN Third and Fourth Committees.
