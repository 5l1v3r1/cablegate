SUBJECT: KUWAIT: UN SOMA PASSED BY COMMITTEE BUT NOT BY 
FULL NATIONAL ASSEMBLY 
 
REF: USUN 796 
 
¶1.  (U) Post has confirmed that, as of Monday April 17, the 
United Nations Status of Mission Agreement (SOMA) reputed to 
have passed in reftel has not yet been voted on in Kuwait's 
National Assembly (NA).  The UN SOMA has been approved by the 
NA's Foreign Affairs Committee.  Legislative action stalled 
following the death of the Amir and subsequent change in 
government.  The SOMA is currently not listed as an agenda 
item for this NA session which ends in July. 
 
¶2.  (U) In addition, there is some confusion as to the stated 
number of UN staff currently in Iraq.  Reftel states a total 
number of 250 while U.S. military contacts working 
side-by-side with UNAMI told poloff that UNAMI's 
administrative officer says there are one thousand staff 
members, both military and civilian, in Iraq at any given 
time.  The number was supplied to Humanitarian Operations 
Center (HOC) officers in a request to garner further GOK 
support for issuing visas for entry into Kuwait.  The HOC 
still serves as the clearinghouse for NGOs working in Iraq 
and one of its offices is co-located inside the UN compound. 
The UNAMI administrative officer used the figure in recent 
days to request continued access to the HOC's expedited visa 
issuing process.  Post raises this staffing differential 
(250/1000) to ensure that any decisions being made about 
UNAMI are done with the most accurate information and numbers 
available.
