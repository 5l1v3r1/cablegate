¶1. (SBU) Econoff and TreasAtt April 19 delivered reftel 
demarche to Bahrain Monetary Agency (BMA) Compliance Director 
Ahmed Bumtaia and provided him with a copy of the MENAFATF 
Charities best practices paper.  Bumtaia said he was 
unfamiliar with the paper but promised to study it carefully. 
 
¶2. (SBU) He noted that, in principle, individuals are 
sensitive to the Islamic concept of anonymity in 
charity-giving.  He explained that the purpose of this 
anonymity was to avoid receiving recognition for one's 
charitable acts, and that revealing to whom one has donated 
and how much tended to diminish the purity of the act.  He 
said that for this reason, donors feel their donations are 
private matters that should not be subject to outside 
scrutiny.  Bumtaia said he countered this by asserting that, 
for the donor's protection, the Compliance Directorate had 
the responsibility to ensure that donations were going to 
clean charities. 
 
¶3. (U) Emboffs assured Bumtaia that the MENAFATF paper was a 
local product reflecting regional collaboration.  Bumtaia 
promised to contact Emboffs with any questions or reactions 
to the paper.  He said it was likely that he would head 
Bahrain's delegation to the Fourth Plenary, set for Doha in 
September.
