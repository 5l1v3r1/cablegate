SUBJECT:  VAZQUEZ DELIVERS CLEAR PUBLIC SIGNAL OF SUPPORT 
FOR AN FTA WITH U.S. WHILE ON OFFICIAL VISIT TO MEXICO 
 
 
¶1.  On an official visit to Mexico prior to his arrival in 
the U.S. on April 30, President Vazquez delivered his 
clearest-yet public signal of support for an Uruguay-U.S. 
bilateral Free Trade Agreement (FTA).  In the press 
conference that followed his meeting with Mexican 
President Fox, Vazquez first reiterated his Summit of the 
Americas statement that the conditions for an FTAA were 
not yet propitious, due to "protectionist policies", but 
added that "this does not mean we are not working to 
achieve an FTAA some day, if these conditions changed." 
 
¶2.  Vazquez moved a step further, stating that "the 
political force in government does not see any impediment 
to working on a Free Trade Agreement as we have done with 
our Mexican brothers, and we are working in this respect." 
He stressed that Mercosur's regional process of 
integration "does not mean we have to renounce bilateral 
agreements with other countries."  Vazquez then clarified 
that bilateral FTAs with third countries would be done 
within the norms of Mercosur, which contemplate specific 
exceptions in this respect." 
 
¶3.  While admitting that Mercosur was going through one of 
its "worst moments" and was not beneficial for Uruguay in 
its present state, Vazquez stressed that Mercosur 
continued to be a strategic priority for the GOU.  He 
advocated for a Mercosur benefiting all of its members and 
called for an expansion to include new members such as 
Mexico (Note:  Mexico's long-standing request for 
membership is being resisted by Brazil.  End Note.) 
 
¶4.  Back in Uruguay, the three largest business chambers 
issued a joint statement on April 26, urging the GOU to 
negotiate an FTA with the U.S., emphasizing the importance 
of the U.S. market for Uruguay.  In a business roundtable 
on the same day, ex-Presidents Sanginetti (Colorado) and 
Lacalle (Blanco) also urged the GOU to focus on bilateral 
trade agreements, be it with the U.S., China or Japan, 
while continuing to work on a "better Mercosur".  They 
stressed the "grave crisis" facing the trading bloc.
