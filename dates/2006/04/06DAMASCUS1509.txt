¶3.  Editorial Block Quotes: 
 
------------------------ 
 
"Rice's Acknowledgement" 
 
------------------------ 
 
Isam Dari, an editorialist in government-owned Tishreen, wrote 
(4/4): "Why have US Secretary of State Rice and British Home 
Office Secretary Straw come to Iraq? Have they succeeded in 
putting the Iraqi house, which their countries have destroyed, 
in order? 
 
"Rice expressed her anger over the delay in the formation of a 
new Iraqi government.... 
 
"These two countries' interference in Iraqi affairs has become a 
daily routine.... Has Rice come to Iraq to correct some of the 
mistakes she said the United State has committed in Iraq? 
 
"The acknowledgement of mistakes will not compensate for the 
lives of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and for the destruction 
of the country." 
 
---------------------- 
 
"Claims on Democracy" 
 
 
---------------------- 
 
Adnan Nasir, a columnist in government-owned Al-Ba'th, wrote 
(4/4): "The victory of HAMAS in the Palestinian elections shows 
that US policy in the region has failed.... 
 
 
 
 
"The US Administration has rejected the will of a nation to 
choose its representatives fairly and freely in accordance with 
Western criteria.... The United States has launched a starvation 
campaign against the Palestinian people to force them to abandon 
their choice.... 
 
"If US President Bush does not recognize the results of the 
democratic process in Palestine, his slogans will lose their 
meaning.... The current Bush administration adopted Sharon's 
policies, supported Zionist terrorism against the Palestinian 
people, and recognized major settlements in the West Bank.... 
 
"How could Bush and Sharon hold negotiations on the future of 
the Palestinians in isolation from the Palestinian leaders? 
Moreover, the Bush administration has decided to besiege and 
isolate HAMAS and to prevent other countries from contacting 
HAMAS leaders...."
