SUBJECT: OPIC INQUIRY RE: BALTIMORE DREDGES 
 
REF: STATE 50643 
 
¶1.  This cable responds to OPIC reftel request for Embassy 
comments regarding OPIC insurance support for a bid bond 
provided by Baltimore Dredges on a contract to sell dredging 
equipment to the Iraqi Ministry of Water Resources (MoWR). 
 
¶2.  In general, we do not know of any adverse issues that 
OPIC should be concerned about regarding this project.  The 
Iraqi public and government would likely have no negative 
sentiment toward the project.  The project would directly 
support the economic objectives of Iraq and would not 
conflict with U.S. policy interests.  The potential 
environmental impacts of the dredging are unknown, but in 
general, dredging operations tend to have localized and 
short-term impacts.  The MoWR is responsible for adhering to 
all applicable environmental and worker health and safety 
standards while conducting dredging operations.
