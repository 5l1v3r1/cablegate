TGS Chief's Annual Address to the War Academy 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶1. Chief of the Turkish General Staff (CHOD) General Hilmi 
Ozkok gave his annual speech to the Istanbul War Academy on 
March 16.  He noted the importance of a cohesive domestic 
government in the international place of a country; 
underlined the importance of a sound security strategy based 
on a strong military to deter symmetrical threats and to 
protect Turkey from asymmetric threats including terrorism. 
Ozkok underscored the need to preserve Turkey's integrity, 
national unity and stability and to protect Turkey's rights 
and interests in Cyprus.  The CHOD also touched on the 
importance of preserving energy sources and energy savings 
and the military personnel and promotion system.  Ozkok uses 
his annual speech to the War Academy to lay out the 
military's priority issues and its red lines.  Despite the 
importance of the speech, it received minimal coverage in 
the Turkish press as the CHOD avoided controversial domestic 
issues. 
 
 
Symposium on Global Terrorism and International Cooperation 
Held in Ankara

¶2. The Turkish General Staff's Center of Excellence for the 
Defense against Terrorism organized its first international 
symposium on Global Terrorism and International Cooperation 
on March 23-24 in Ankara.  The symposium, which focused on 
the effects of globalization on terrorism; security of urban 
areas; and cooperation against all forms of terrorism, 
hosted high ranking participants from 82 countries.  Afghan 
President Hamid Karzai, the Chiefs of General Staff from 6 
countries including GEN Peter Pace, 46 Ambassadors, many 
Turkish and international think tank representatives and 
academics, and military attaches from 46 countries 
participated in the symposium.  Although it was the first 
international symposium with that scale of high ranking 
participation, the organizers were disappointed by the low 
media coverage of the event.
