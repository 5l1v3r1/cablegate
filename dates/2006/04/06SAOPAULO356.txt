"Immigrants In The U.S." 
 
Liberal Folha de S. Paulo (4/3) editorialized: "Debates over the new 
U.S. immigration law are dividing the U.S. The Republicans at the 
House approved a very tough bill that transforms illegal immigration 
into a federal crime, thereby making easier to arrest and deport 
undocumented foreigners.... Another item of the bill is the 
construction of a wall aimed at preventing Mexicans from entering 
the U.S.  Such legislation is a violent response to a concrete 
problem that frightens an increasing number of Americans.  The 
already 11 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. have been accused 
of taking jobs from Americans, reducing their salaries, increasing 
crime rates and benefiting from social programs. Fortunately, not 
everyone in the U.S. shares such a prejudiced view.... Senators, who 
are more moderate, introduced an alternative immigration bill that 
also reinforces border surveillance and facilitates the deportation 
of illegal foreigners, but avoids the worse excesses of the other 
bill.... The Senate's bill has already angered the most conservative 
Republicans, who see legalization as amnesty. President George W. 
Bush, who supports a more generous legislation, is facing a dilemma. 
If he supports the House's bill, he will be contradicting his own 
statements.  If he supports the Senate's alternative, more 
identified with the Democrats, he will oppose the most radical 
Republicans, a group to which he owns his reelection."
