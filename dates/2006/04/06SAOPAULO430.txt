¶1. "Internal Factors" 
 
International writer Igor Gielow commented in liberal Folha de S. 
Paulo (4/25): "It is tempting to seek an easy explanation for the 
attacks in Egypt.  If on the one hand there is a strong 
international component, with a probable link with Al Qaeda and the 
presence of western and Israeli tourists, it is also necessary to 
pay attention to internal factors.  It is necessary to combine these 
pieces with a squeezed middle class that has no political 
representation and with poverty in Cairo, the Nile valley and other 
isolate points in the nation.... With the rise of the network led by 
Osama bin Laden, it has become easy to blame 'international terror' 
for actions such as those of yesterday. Obviously, there is an 
inspiration and maybe some foreign resources.  But poverty and the 
political repression resulting from the failure of the Nasser model, 
personalized in Hosni Mubarak's 25 years of autocratic power, are 
significant factors.  Poverty does not mean violence, but fanatics 
using ideology for their own agenda are facilitated when the state 
is not present." 
 
¶2. "Latinization Of The US" 
 
Former Brazilian ambassador in Washington Rubens Barbosa observed in 
center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (4/25): "The issue involving 
illegal immigrants has gained a political dimension of unpredictable 
consequences in the US.... Latin Americans in the US currently total 
more than 25 million and have become in 2005 the largest minority in 
the nation.... Latinos are modifying the way the US feels, thinks, 
eats, dances and votes.... From a political standpoint, public 
demonstrations have shown something new in terms of organizational 
capability and influence in the US political scene. The political 
power of the Latino vote is present today in large, medium and small 
American cities.... As a group, the Latinos still do not have their 
own political identity and define themselves more by immediate 
concrete interests (immigration policy and living conditions, for 
example). As one could predict, some conservative and traditional 
sectors of the US society are reacting strongly.... What is going on 
is a process of Latinization of the US, especially in the South, and 
a populational reoccupation of lost territories resembling a 
peaceful reclaiming [of land]."
