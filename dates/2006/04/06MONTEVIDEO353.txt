¶1. (SBU) The long-running dispute between Argentina and 
Uruguay over construction of giant pulp mills on a shared 
river seems to have worsened and entered into a more 
litigious phase after Presidents Vazquez and Kirchner 
canceled their plans to meet on the issue last week. 
Uruguayan public criticism over its Government's handling of 
the affair and comments made by the GOA's Minister of the 
Interior that Vazquez ""was not in control,"" because he failed 
to order a closing of the plants, apparently has stung 
Vazquez and spurred the GOU to search for a new strategy.  As 
of April 11, a second bridge, out of three bridges linking 
Argentina with Uruguay was also blocked by Argentine 
protesters.  Construction on the Finnish-owned Botnia plant 
has been suspended until April 18, but only because of the 
Easter holidays. 
 
Media Reaction 
-------------- 
¶2. (U) Following the partial breakdown in negotiations, the 
GOU has relegated the matter to Foreign Minister Reinaldo 
Gargano. Embassy understands that the MFA is attempting to 
bring the issue before Mercosur and the International Court 
of Justice (ICJ) in the Hague.  Uruguayan sources contend 
that Argentina (which holds the Pro-tempore Mercosur 
presidency until July) has rejected the complaint in Mercosur 
on grounds that the dispute is purely bilateral. News reports 
also indicate that Uruguay has not yet lodged a formal 
complaint in The Hague, but has only delivered a letter to 
the ICJ informing it of the problem. The letter's contents, 
highlighting that the bridge blockades were a violation of 
international law were published in the press. 
 
¶3. (U) The Uruguayan media reported that an independent 
Canadian environmental consulting firm who analyzed the 
International Finance Corporation's (IFC) Cumulative Impact 
Study (CIS), downplayed the ecological dangers of the 
cellulose plants. The press also carried unsubstantiated 
reports that Argentine protesters were planning to block 
ferry traffic on the Rio de la Plata and that energy supplies 
from Argentina to Uruguay could be affected. Also covered 
were threats by Uruguayan truckers to mount their own bridge 
blockades. One editorial in the daily ""Ultimas Noticias"" 
contrasted President Vazquez' ""respect for the rule of law"" 
in honoring private contracts with Argentina's Interior 
Minister's call to force the plants to halt construction for 
up to 90 days. 
 
Comment: 
-------- 
¶4. (SBU) It is difficult to predict what might happen next in 
this ongoing bilateral dispute, but the Uruguayans 
displeasure at Argentina over the pulp mill issue is already 
fairly intense. Judging from recent press reports and 
reactions by our contacts, Uruguay is likely to more 
aggressively seek international support for its position that 
the bridge blockades violate international law and treaties. 
End Comment.
