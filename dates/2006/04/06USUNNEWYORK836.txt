SUBJECT: UN/IRAQ: SYG LETTER REGARDING UNMOVIC MANDATE 
 
 
On April 19, the UNSC President circulate to UNSC members a 
letter received the same day from SYG Annan regarding the 
mandate of the UN Monitoring and Verification Commission 
(UNMOVIC).  Text of letter follows. 
 
Begin text: 
 
Dear Mr. President, 
 
I have the honour to refer to Security Council resolution 
1284 (1999) which established, as a subsidiary body of the 
Council, the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and 
Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC).  Reference is also made to 
the related resolutions 687 (1991) and 706 (1991). 
 
I should like to draw your attention to the recently 
concluded 2004-2005 un-audited financial statements for the 
Iraq Escrow Account particularly as they relate to UNMOVIC. 
In those statements, UNMOVIC incurred total expenditures of 
$31.7 million against an income of $11.7 million - mostly 
interest income.  The shortfall (20 million) was covered from 
the reserves and fund balances.  The reserves and fund 
balances which, at the beginning of the biennium stood at 
$353 million, were further reduced by $200 million that was 
transferred to the Development Fund for Iraq, and $22.7 
million that was used to settle the outstanding arrears of 
assessed contributions that the government of Iraq had with 
the United Nations ($20.3 million) and the IAEA ($2.5 
million).  Consequently, the reserves and fund balances now 
stand at $113.9 million.  In the meantime, the current 
UNMOVIC budget for six months (1 January - 30 June 2006) 
stands at $6.4 million.  If the costs are maintained at the 
current level, about $25.5 million will be needed for this 
biennium (2006-2007). 
 
I should also like to draw your attention to my report to the 
General Assembly on mandating and delivering: analysis and 
recommendations to facilitate the review of mandates 
(A/60/733).  The text of paragraph 117 reads as follows: 
 
"The United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection 
Commission (UNMOVIC) was established under Security Council 
resolution 1284 (1999) to verify the disarmament of Iraq of 
biological and chemical weapons and missiles and other means 
of delivery with ranges greater than 150 km, and to monitor 
Iraq's compliance with its obligations not to use, develop, 
construct or acquire such weapons.  UNMOVIC is widely seen as 
having accumulated significant experience, including in the 
area of biological weapons and means of delivery, 
constituting expertise that does not exist elsewhere in the 
multilateral system.  As the situation in Iraq evolves, A 
Security Council review of the UNMOVIC mandate may be 
warranted, including examination of whether and how the 
United Nations could utilize certain areas of the 
Commission's expertise such as its roster of trained 
technical experts." 
 
In the light of the above, the Council is invited to consider 
undertaking a review of the mandate incorporated in Security 
Council resolution 1284 (1999). 
 
Please accept, Mr. President, the assurances of my highest 
consideration. 
 
Signed: Kofi A. Annan
