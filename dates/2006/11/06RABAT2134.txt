 ¶1. (SBU)  Econ Counselor pursued the issue of Moroccan debt 
relief for Iraq in a November 16 meeting with Ambassador 
Mohammed Azeroual, Director General for Arab and Islamic 
Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Azarwal noted 
that the GOM has been in repeated contact with Iraqi 
officials on debt relief, and that Minister of Finance 
Oualalou had discussed the matter with his Iraqi counterpart 
on the margins of this year's IMF meetings in Singapore. 
Azarwal stressed that there is no government-to-government 
debt between Morocco and Iraq; what is outstanding is 
approximately USD 30 million in debts owed to private 
companies (primarily in the textile field) from before the 
first Gulf War.  Morocco paid off a portion of these 
companies' losses through export insurance policies that they 
had taken out, but the entire debt was not covered. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In Singapore, the two ministers agreed that Morocco 
would not pursue the debt, which Azerwal said the government 
had never done in any case.  He added, however, that it would 
be necessary to "convince the companies" concerned to abandon 
their claims.  Because the debt is private and not public, 
Azerwal said, Morocco had told Iraq that it would not be 
appropriate to notify the Paris Club of the agreement.
