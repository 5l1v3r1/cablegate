¶1. On November 17, PolCouns delivered reftel demarche to the 
MFA's Director for Mulilateral Affairs Beatriz Nunez. The 
Charge also raised the issue with the MFA's Director General 
Jose Luis Cancela on November 21. Both officials responded 
favorably to the proposals for sending at least one Uruguayan 
instructor to Guatemala's Peace Operations Training Center 
and to search for additional ideas to assist the CFAC 
multinational peacekeeping battalion within the context of 
GPOI. Cancela said that the MFA would consult with the MOD 
before providing a definitive answer.  Per Nunez request, we 
have followed up the demarche with a diplomatic note. 
 
¶2. On the military side, UY Army commander Rosales told ODC 
commander that that he was well disposed towards sending at 
least one instructor to the Peace Operations Training Center 
in Guatemala and was just waiting for the MFA's invitation to 
reach his office. 
 
¶3. Comment: Embassy recommends that the relevant subject 
material experts stay in close touch on details and logistics 
to ensure this mission's success. End Comment.
