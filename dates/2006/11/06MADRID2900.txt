(SBU)   Emboff delivered ref A demarche on November 15 to 
Juan Manuel Gonzalez de Linares Palou, MFA subdirector 
general for the United Nations, regarding the re-election of 
Michael Matheson to the International Law Commission. 
Linares claimed to Emboff that Spain "became aware of the 
Matheson candidacy very late" and noted that other members of 
the WEOG informed them of their candidacies well before the 
U.S.  He indicated that Spain has already committed its 
support to other candidates, but that he has instructed the 
Spanish delegation in New York to do what is possible to 
reach a solution.  (NOTE: Post approached MFA about this 
matter in August and again in October, and USUN approached 
Spain-UN as well (reftels B and C). END NOTE.)
