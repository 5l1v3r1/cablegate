ORGANIZATION'S UPCOMING MARITIME SAFETY COMMITTEE MEETING 
 
REF: STATE 183434 
 
(U) Embassy delivered reftel demarche to Peter Shepherd of 
New Zealand Customs Service and to Peter Williams of Maritime 
New Zealand. Although both agencies have an interest in 
different aspects of the two maritime safety and security 
programs (the Long Range Identification and Tracking (LRIT) 
and the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS)), 
Williams will be the only GNZ representative at the upcoming 
Maritime Committee Meeting (MSC). Williams tells Post that he 
is in general agreement with the points raised in the 
demarche and hopes to work together with the U.S. at the 
upcoming meeting to advance the two security programs.
