¶1.  In response to reftel request (para 10), Post has issued 
a management notice informing all employees and their 
families of the need to prepare for a potential influenza 
pandemic.  This management notice advised employees to 
stockpile supplies of food, infant formula and water, and 
other important items, for at least two weeks.  The two week 
duration reflected the Department of Health and Human 
Services Guidelines for the United States, where the basic 
services infrastructure is similar to that in Spain. 
 
¶2.  Information about Avian Flu has been provided during 
periodic Town Hall meetings and the MED Avian Flu DVD has 
been made available to both Mission staff and the wider 
American community.  Post will continue to emphasize during 
our Town Hall meetings reftel cable objective to improve 
preparedness. 
 
¶3.  With regards to additional steps recommended in reftel 
cable: 
 
--  To encourage the maintenance of personal hygiene, 
Management will procure additional alcohol, hand sanitizers, 
and dispensers for workplace and public areas in the embassy. 
 
--  Post will continue to improve our planning according to 
new incoming information.  We will initiate efforts to 
stockpile additional fuel and spare parts for our motor pool. 
 We will also stockpile spare parts for our generators, HVAC 
systems, computers, phones and other vital equipment.  We 
will also explore revising procedures to ensure the cleaning 
of the facilities and equipment during critical periods. 
 
--  Post already has the ability to provide potable water for 
8 weeks with normal use, and up to 12 weeks or more with 
restricted use. 
 
--  Health Unit has already advised Mission staff to secure 
one year supplies of needed medication. 
 
--  Health Unit continues to maintain local medical and 
public health liaison and has on hand appropriate stocks of 
antiviral pandemic medication and PEE equipment. 
 
--  Following London RMO,s instructions, the Health Unit has 
provided additional advice to employees.  Employees have been 
encouraged to wipe the surfaces of their working areas with a 
paper towel, soap and water on a regular basis.  These areas 
include their computers, keyboards, and telephone receiver. 
The Health Unit has distributed this information while 
reiterating previous advice regarding hand washing and cough 
barrier methods.
