¶1.  Summary:  Syrian papers today reported President Asad's meeting 
with Arab Parliamentarians attending a meeting of the Interim Arab 
Parliament in Damascus.  Arab League SecGen Amr Mousa also attended. 
 President Asad held a separate meeting with Mousa, which focused on 
current events in the Arab arena and means of enhancing Arab 
solidarity. 
Papers reported President Asad's meeting on Sunday with Osama Sa'd, 
Chairman of the Nasserite Popular Organization in Lebanon, who 
stressed the importance of consolidating Syrian-Lebanese relations 
and reaching a reconciliation among the Lebanese to secure stability 
in Lebanon and confront international pressure. 
Papers also reported Libyan President Muammar Qaddafi's meeting in 
Libya with Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouallem, who conveyed a 
message from President Asad.  Headlines featured a statement by 
Abdul-Rahman Shalqam, Libyan Secretary of Foreign Communication and 
International Cooperation, confirming Syria's important role in the 
region and describing the policy of isolating Syria as "wrong and 
not in the interest of anyone." 
On Iraq, papers reported the death sentence issued against Saddam 
Hussein.  Headlines portrayed the sentence as a step that positively 
serves US congressional election purposes. 
End of summary.

¶3.  Editorial Block Quotes: 
 
------------------------------------------- 
 
"They Must Have Listened to the President" 
------------------------------------------- 
Abd-al-Fattah al-Awad, Chief Editor of government-owned Al-Thawra, 
commented (11/6):  "We recall President Al-Asad's warnings before 
the Iraq war.... If Americans had listened, Iraq, the US, and the 
rest of the world would have been spared the destructive results of 
the war.... Through the Iraq war, the United States lost its 
prestige and showed the fragility of its slogans.... 
"America's allies in Lebanon are now worried that the US 
Administration has no time for them because it is busy with its own 
problems and scandals.... 
"Recent US statements against Syria were meant as a message of 
assurance to those Lebanese forces, which have begun to suspect that 
the United States has sold them.... The fact is that the United 
States has not sold them, because it has found no one to buy them, 
but it has ended, or is about to end, the lease it signed with some 
of them or some of their representatives.... 
"Those who were correct in their vision about Iraq are confident 
that they are also right in their vision about many other issues.... 
Syria has a record of correct positions toward controversial issues. 
 People discovered later that Syria was sincere and that what it 
expected and what really happened were identical.  This is not only 
a matter of expectation.  It is a vision based on valuable 
experience that allows Syria to see things clearly despite all the 
storms that this region has experienced by virtue of history and 
geography.  This sound vision makes Damascus an obligatory 
passageway for everyone seeking peace and everyone wanting to know 
the facts as they are." 
 
------------------------ 
"Common Characteristics" 
------------------------ 
Ahmad Dawwa, an editorialist in government-owned Al-Thawra, 
commented (11/6):  "The Israeli government and the Bush 
administration share many characteristics that threaten world peace 
and security, notably their tendency to compensate for failure by 
engaging in deliberate killing, leveling accusations against others, 
and shirking responsibilities.... 
"Israel has killed more than 40 Palestinians in the past four days 
under the false pretext of stopping rocket fire, while the real 
objective is to regain the confidence of the Israelis and compensate 
for the failure in Lebanon.  In Iraq, hundreds of Iraqis are killed 
and wounded daily as a result of US political and security 
failure.... 
"Many Arab governments and politicians are largely responsible for 
this.... These governments and these politicians publicly declare 
their loyalty to and friendship with the United States and do what 
they are asked to do.  At least they do not employ this relationship 
to stop the killing of women and children in Palestine and Iraq.... 
"It is very strange that while 78 percent of the British people and 
a majority of Americans see US President George Bush as a threat to 
international peace and security, some of our politicians see him as 
a supporter of freedom, sovereignty, and independence."
