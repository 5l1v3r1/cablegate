Summary:  Taiwan's dailies gave significant coverage November 15 to 
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who was questioned by the prosecutors 
Tuesday over alleged misuse of his special mayoral expense fund. 
News coverage also focused on the two DPP legislators, who announced 
their resignation effective this week in protest of the party's 
handling of the corruption scandal implicating President Chen 
Shui-bian and his wife; and on the year-end Taipei and Kaohsiung 
mayoral races.  In terms of editorials and commentaries, the 
pro-independence "Liberty Times," Taiwan's largest-circulation 
daily, is the only paper that editorialized on the upcoming APEC 
leaders' summit.  The paper said the United States' proposal of 
signing a "Free Trade Agreement of Asia and the Pacific" and Japan's 
proposal of an "Economic Partnership Agreement" for East Asia should 
be interpreted as their reactions to and challenge against the 
"ASEAN plus one" and "ASEAN plus three" free trade area directed by 
China.  End summary. 
 
"Market Is Available Everywhere As Long As Taiwan Befriends the 
World" 
 
The pro-independence "Liberty Times" [circulation: 600,000] 
editorialized (11/15): 
 
"The leaders' summit of the 2006 APEC meeting, the focus of world 
attention, will be held on November 18.  The United States has 
recently made an open proposal to sign a "Free Trade Agreement of 
Asia and the Pacific" among all APEC members.  Not long ago, the 
Ministry of Economics of Japan also proposed the Japanese version of 
an "Economic Partnership Agreement" for East Asia.  We believe that 
the moves by Japan and the United States at this moment can be 
interpreted as their reactions to and challenge against the 'ASEAN 
plus one' and 'ASEAN plus three' free trade area directed by China. 
... 
 
"Regardless of whether the ten plus three or ten plus six 
cooperation will come to pass or not, these proposals have 
highlighted two problems that are difficult to overcome among the 
members:  The first problem is about 'China being the one and only 
absolute power' [among the members]. ...  The second is about the 
balance of power among the various powerful countries in the world. 
The East Asian area, with countries such as Japan, Taiwan, and the 
Philippines in particular, has always been the United States' first 
frontline of national defense.  But the United States is excluded 
from the ten plus one, which China has been pushing most vigorously, 
and also the ten plus three or ten plus six [programs].  Washington 
certainly will not be happy to see Japan, Taiwan, and the 
Philippines become either the inner or outer circles of China's 'ten 
plus one' economic zone.  This explains why the United States wanted 
to take advantage of this year's APEC meeting in Hanoi to propose 
the establishment of a free trade agreement among all the APEC 
members. ..."
