Secretary Rumsfeld or the midterm elections and stands ready 
 
SIPDIS 
to work with the United States and both its political parties. 
 
-- VFM Wu Dawei discussed the DPRK with Russian DFM Alexeyev. 
 China seeks speedy resumption of the Six-Party Talks and 
hopes the United States' and Macao's investigations into 
North Korean financial issues will be resolved soon.  The 
Spokesman knew nothing about FM Li meeting with DPRK 
officials. 
 
-- Japan's concern about CNOOC exploration in the East China

-- China looks to strengthen ties with new UNSC member Panama 
and Nicaragua's newly elected President Daniel Ortega, even 
though neither country recognizes the PRC. 
 
-- China congratulates Margaret Chan on her selection as to 
lead the World Health Organization (WHO).  China believes WHO 
membership for Taiwan is not appropriate, but that decision 
is made by the World Health Assembly, not by Ms. Chan. 
 
-- President Hu will have bilateral meetings with the United 
States, Japan and Russia on the margins of the APEC Leaders 
Meeting. 
 
-- The Year of Russia in China produced many achievements and 
strengthened strategic partnership between the two countries. 
 
 
U.S. Midterm Elections, Rumsfeld resignation 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  China has no comment on the internal affairs of the 
United States, MFA Spokesperson Jiang Yu said in response to 
questions about the resignation of Defense Secretary Rumsfeld 
and the U.S. midterm elections.  China looks forward to 
increasing military cooperation and understanding through 
dialogue and exchange with the United States, she said. 
China feels the development of peaceful and stable relations 
between the United States and China is the consensus of both 
the Republican and Democratic parties.  Asked if China was 
concerned about what a reporter called the "anti-China 
sentiment" of Representative Nancy Pelosi, soon to be Speaker 
of the House, Jiang said China is ready to work with the 
United States and push for a constructive relationship. 
 
DPRK; Six-Party Talks 
---------------------- 
 
¶3.  VFM Wu Dawei met Russian DFM Alexeyev today and called 
for implementation of the September 2005 Joint Declaration 
and speedy resumption of Six-Party Talks to achieve a 
denuclearized, peaceful and stable Korean Peninsula, said 
Jiang.  On the topic of financial sanctions against North 
Korea, Jiang said China hopes the current investigation by 
Macao and the United States will be resolved at an early 
date. 
 
¶4.  Asked by Global News Radio to confirm South Korean news 
reports that FM Li is meeting this week with North Korean 
officials, Jiang said she had not heard of such a meeting. 
 
Japan,s Concerns On East China Sea Unnecessary 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶5.  Alleged oil drilling by China,s CNOOC company on the 
continental shelf in the waters near the Chinese coast is a 
normal development activity, said Jiang responding to a 
question from a Hong Kong reporter.  Jiang said Japan,s 
recent expression of concern and anxiety over this 
development is unnecessary. 
 
China To Strengthen Ties with Nicaragua, Panama 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶6.  China noted the election of Daniel Ortega as President of 
Nicaragua and is willing to establish state-to-state 
relations with the Central American nation, said Jiang. 
China also congratulates Panama on joining the UN Security 
Council as a non-permanent member and looks forward to 
strengthening relations between the two countries while 
cooperating on a variety of international issues.  Neither 
Nicaragua nor Panama recognizes the People,s Republic of 
 
BEIJING 00023715  002 OF 002 
 
 
China. 
 
Margaret Chan and Taiwan WHO Membership 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  China congratulates Margaret Chan on her selection as the 
new World Health Organization (WHO) Secretary-General. 
Taiwan is not a sovereign nation and thus not eligible for 
WHO membership, said Jiang when asked if Chan would be more 
receptive to Taiwan's membership bids.  The acceptance of new 
members into the WHO is the common decision made by all 
members of the World Health Assembly, not the personal 
decision of the Secretary General.  Chan will independently 
conduct work in accordance with the rules and regulations of 
the WHO and care for the health and well-being of all people, 
Jiang said. 
 
¶8.  A reporter stated that FM Li told visiting U.S. 
Undersecretary Nicholas Burns that the United States 
supported Chan's candidacy and asked how the U.S. expressed 
this support.  Jiang responded that China congratulates Chan 
and appreciates the support and trust in Chan shown by all 
involved country. 
 
APEC Summit Meetings 
-------------------- 
 
¶9.  In response to a question, Jiang said President Hu will 
have bilateral meetings with leaders of the United States, 
Japan and Russia on the margins of the APEC Economic Leaders 
Meeting, November 18-19. 
 
Year of Russia Concludes 
------------------------ 
 
¶10.  Asked by a CCTV journalist about the achievements of the 
Year of Russia in China and preparations for the Year of 
China in Russia, Jiang said the Year of Russia in China was a 
great success, strengthening both countries, strategic 
cooperative partnership.  Over 200 events were held in an 
array of fields, including politics, economics, culture, 
education, IT and military.  Goals for the Year of China in 
Russia include raising mutual understanding, cooperation and 
strategic partnership.
