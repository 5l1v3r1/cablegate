¶1. The EU-Russia Permanent Partnership Council on Justice and Home 
Affairs met in Helsinki on 30 October.  The Finnish Minister of 
Justice Luhtanen and Minister of the Interior Rajamaki represented 
the Presidency, German Minister of Justice Zypries and Minister of 
the Interior Schauble represented the next Presidency, and 
Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security Frattini represented 
the EU.  Minister of Justice Ustinov, Minister of the Interior 
Nurgalijev, General Public Prosecutor Chaika, and Presidential Aide 
Viktor Ivanov represented Russia.  The agenda included discussions 
on trafficking in persons (TIP), terrorism, drugs, organized crime, 
and judicial cooperation. 
 
¶2. In the closing press conference attended by Emboff, Frattini 
emphasized tangible results from the day's discussions including the 
upcoming entry into force of EU-Russia visa agreements, a commitment 
to meet again during the Finnish Presidency at the expert level with 
Russian and US representatives on counterterrorism, and an agreement 
on EU-Russia data exchange on radicalization and recruitment of 
Islamic youth.  Rajamaki highlighted the Seminar on the 
Identification of Children at Risk of Becoming Victims of Human 
Trafficking (taking place 31 October in Helsinki with several US 
participants) as an example of multilateral cooperation on justice 
issues.  Luhtanen called on Moscow to ratify the Hague Convention on 
Child Abduction and the Council of Europe Convention on Money 
Laundering to strengthen Russia's efforts in these areas and to bind 
Russia to existing European structures.  Ivanov and Chaika used 
their statements to call attention to discussions on visa 
facilitation and readmission policies, as 4 million people cross 
between the EU and Russia annually.  (Comment: Zypries and Schauble 
did not attend the press conference; Ustinov and Nurgalijev remained 
at the back of the room with security personnel.) 
 
¶3. During the question and answer session, Luhtanen opined that the 
future of EU-Russia JHA cooperation might be found in the extensive 
Finland-Russia cooperation that currently takes place outside EU 
fora; she said that perhaps the next steps were to make these 
arrangements multilateral rather than continuing in a bilateral 
format.  Rajamaki pointed out that the EU and Russia are seeing 
increasing radicalization of second generation immigrant Muslim 
youth and that this pointed to a failure to adequately integrate 
immigrant populations rather than a failure of immigration policy 
per se.  Chaika was peppered with queries about the Anna 
Politkovskaya murder after he mentioned, in response to an unrelated 
question, that he is personally responsible for the investigation. 
Finnish television and print media were particularly hard on this 
issue, eliciting irritation from Chaika.  Once the questions moved 
to illegal drug trafficking, Ivanov opined that the flow of heroin 
into Russia and the EU from Afghanistan was as much a socio-economic 
problem within Afghanistan as it was a border and justice problem 
within Europe and Russia. 
 
¶4. The joint statement issued by the PPC, in addition to the issues 
discussed above, welcomed increased cooperation between the EU 
border security agency (Frontex) and the Russian border service and 
discussed the desire of both the EU and Russia for increased 
judicial and legal cooperation in criminal and civil matters.  The 
closing statement, along with formal statements from the Presidency 
representatives, are available on the Finnish EU Presidency 
website.
