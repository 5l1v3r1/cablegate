CHECK ON LICENSE DA1023-06 
 
REF:  STATE 169012 
 
¶1. (SBU) Per reftel, Post Blue Lantern Action Officer contacted 
the French company CEO Jean-Marc Gardin regarding export license 
DA1023-06, involving the export of components for flight 
simulators to Canadian firm CAE.  According to Garden, the 
distribution agreement between Thales Electronics, BEI Sensors, 
and CAE, Inc. conforms to the terms of export license DA1923-06. 
 Thales has also confirmed that all of its end-users under this 
distribution agreement are not prohibited from receiving 
U.S.-origin defense articles, as stipulated by the International 
Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) section 126.1.  He said that 
he realizes that the end users of this equipment must reside in 
certain, specified countries and that this list evolves.  Thales 
takes care to ensure that it conforms to the evolving list. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Gardin told us that Thales has done business with CAE 
Canada since 1997.  It has delivered five IESIs containing the 
QRS-11 for use in flight simulators on the following dates: 
July 29, 2005; November 30, 2005; January 3, 2006; March 1, 
2006, and March 30, 2006.  He said that for each transaction 
Thales explicitly disclosed to CAE that the hardware contained 
U.S. origin components.  It also advised CAE regularly and at 
various levels on the restrictions governing the unauthorized 
re-transfer of IESI's equipped with U.S.-origin components.
