¶1. (SBU) In a November 19 telcon with poloff, Walaa Soliman 
(wife of prisoner Nabil Soliman) reported that she was 
allowed to visit her husband at Torah Prison on November 18. 
Walaa noted that she gave food to her husband, but he did not 
specify whether he would continue his hunger strike or not. 
She said that her husband hopes to be moved to another 
prison; poloff recommended that he raise his request with 
prison officials.  Walaa plans to visit Soliman again on 
November 25.  Poloff will continue to monitor Soliman's 
welfare and treatment, through visits and communications with 
his family.
