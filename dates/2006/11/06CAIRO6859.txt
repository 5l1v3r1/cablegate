¶1.  (SBU) The Ambassador and Nancy Rivera, OPIC Director of 
Structured Finance, met with Minister of Transportation Mansour to 
discuss the Damietta port project.  Rivera explained that in order 
for OPIC to help finance the project, the GOE would need to amend 
the concession contract.  The contract was approved by the Cabinet, 
so any amendments would also need Cabinet approval.  The first of 
the amendments grants authority to the financiers to take control of 
the operation if the project is failing.  The second is to indemnify 
the financiers in the event the GOE takes an action or passes a law 
that adversely affects the project.  Rivera explained that without 
these clauses, not only would OPIC not participate, but the project 
would not likely attract any international finance.  Mansour agreed 
to present the amendments to the Cabinet and was confident he could 
obtain the support needed for approval. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The DCM and Rivera also met with Minister of Investment 
Mohieldin to brief him on the amendments.  Mohieldin expressed his 
support and shared Mansour's optimism that the Cabinet would approve 
the amendments.  He also asked for follow up on OPIC's expression of 
interest in supporting projects in Egypt's real estate sector. 
Mohieldin is the driving force behind GOE efforts to encourage 
mortgage finance in the real estate sector, which currently operates 
on informal financing schemes controlled by real estate developers. 
OPIC President Mosbacher and Vice President for Structured Finance 
Drumheller visited Egypt last summer to discuss the possibility of 
OPIC backing for low-cost mortgage financing through commercial 
banks.  Rivera agreed to convey Mohieldin's request to the 
appropriate OPIC officials in Washington. 
 
¶3.  (U) Background:  The Damietta port project is a concession from 
the Cabinet to a Kuwaiti company to build a private container 
processing facility alongside the public facility in Damietta.  The 
GOE hopes that competition from the private facility will improve 
overall services at the port.  The Kuwaiti company is seeking 
international finance for the project, including from OPIC. 
Although the two clauses mentioned above are normally part of a 
concession contract such as the one for Damietta, they were not 
included in the Damietta contract.
