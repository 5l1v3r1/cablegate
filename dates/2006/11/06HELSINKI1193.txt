 ¶1. (SBU) On 29 November, DCM delivered demarche to Finnish 
Foreign Ministry Political Director Pilvi-Sisko Vierros 
Villeneuve.  Vierros Villeneuve welcomed US points on Georgia 
and agreed that maintaining US-EU unity is crucial. 
 
¶2. (C) On Moldova, Vierros Villeneuve also fully agreed on 
the need for the US and the EU to remain united, the 
importance of returning to the 5-2 process, and getting the 
Transnistrians back to the table.  However, regarding an 
international Peace Consolidation Mission, Vierros Villeneuve 
emphasized that the EU has reached no common position on this 
and, indeed, has not even been offered the opportunity to do 
so.  Referencing her recent telecon with EUR DAS David 
Kramer, she explained that the Belgian OSCE chairmanship has 
yet to present its draft statement on the PCM to the EU for 
comment, and there can be no unified EU position until this 
takes place.  Without having officially seen this proposal, 
Vierros Villeneuve expressed concern that a tactical approach 
toward internationalizing the Moldovan peacekeeping force 
(PKF) would not be credible unless the EU was immediately 
ready to step forward with its replacement force; however, it 
is not ready at this time due to difficulty generating troops 
and a lack of member state concensus.  Finland remains 
committed to the Hill paper and is not convinced that 
internationalizing the PKF will trigger settlement and 
instead believes it should be part of an overall settlement 
process. 
 
¶3. (C) Although the EU has not reached consensus and the 
Belgian OSCE Chair has not yet formally circulated its 
proposals, Vierros Villeneuve expressed some guarded 
optimism, saying that "the gap is closing."  However, she 
also reiterated the US point regarding the importance of 
showing US-EU unity -- especially to the Russians.  While 
Europe is in the process of coming to consensus, she urged, 
"let's not show to Russia that there is any US-EU 
disagreement."
