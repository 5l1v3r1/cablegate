SUBJECT: CANADA SUPPORTS UNIFIED APPROACH TO GEORGIA AND 
MOLDOVA CONFLICTS 
 
REF: STATE 190264 
 
¶1. (U) Urgent action request.  Please see para four (4). 
 
¶2.  (SBU) We conveyed reftel demarche on November 22 to 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) 
Political Director Colleen Swords, and on November 24 to OSCE 
Desk Officer Neil Brennan.  Canada is in strong agreement 
with the U.S. on how best to ease tensions in Georgia and 
Moldova, Brennan said.  Nevertheless, Canadian officials 
doubt there will be agreement on a ministerial declaration or 
a regional statement at the OSCE Ministerial in December. 
Instead, Brennan said, the Chair will probably issue a 
political declaration that tracks with U.S. and Canadian 
preferences. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Brennan agreed to convey our demarche to the GOC 
delegation in Vienna and to instruct its members to support 
the views expressed therein.  He ended the meeting with a 
request for a copy of the Russian draft text that referred to 
separatist regimes as "republics" (reftel). 
 
¶4.  (U) Post requests Department send a copy of the Russian 
text noted in para 4 to Brennan immediately upon receipt of 
this message at: Neil.Brennan@INTERNATIONAL.GC.CA 
or via FAX at 613-992-2482.
