SUBJECT: POLITICS STILL LOOMS OVER TAIWAN IMPORTS OF U.S. 
BEEF 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  In advance of USDA Deputy Undersecretary 
Lambert's visit, Taiwan Minister of Health Hou Sheng-mou 
complained to AIT Director Young about politically motivated 
criticism of DOH and its decision-making process to reopen 
Taiwan's market to U.S. beef.  Hou sought the Director's 
support to counter such criticism.  While noncommittal on 
specific support, the Director noted the sound science used 
by Taiwan in reopening its market.  End Summary. 
 
Political Situation Surrounding Beef Imports 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) On November 14, AIT Director Young met with 
Department of Health (DOH) Minister HOU Sheng-mou to discuss 
the US beef import situation in advance of USDA Deputy 
Undersecretary Lambert's visit November 18 - 20.  At the 
Director's request, DOH Vice Minister Wang Hsiu-hung also 
attended the meeting, along with Dr. Peter Chang, Director 
General, International Affairs, DOH, and Dr. HSIAO Tung-ming, 
Counselor, DOH.  Keith Schneller, ATO Director, and Rosemary 
KAO, AGR Agricultural Specialist, accompanied the Director to 
the meeting.  Dr. HSIAO, until recently the Director General 
of the Bureau of Food Safety until Minister Hou removed him 
over importation of contaminated crabs from Shanghai, 
commented life is good in Taiwan except for the overwhelming 
pressure from the media. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Minister HOU has been reluctant to discuss the US 
beef import situation with US officials in the recent past, 
but requested this meeting because he will not be able to 
meet Lambert next week.  As Minister, Hou explained he must 
be personally present at the Legislative Yuan (LY) on Monday 
to respond to any queries LY members may pose.  Hou expressed 
his frustration to the Director over a draft LY investigative 
report recently circulated for comment.  This report, 
authored by LY members who have been highly critical of the 
DOH regarding the reopening of the beef market last January, 
accuses DOH of reopening the Taiwan market to U.S. beef under 
pressure from the U.S. and without regard to the safety of 
the imported beef.  One of the authors, TSU legislator Lai 
Hsin-yuan, is trying to attract media attention to her 
consumer protection efforts and another may have close ties 
to Australian beef interests.  Minister HOU stressed this 
inflammatory report is politically charged and has nothing to 
do with scientific realities.  However, the report has put 
great pressure on DOH to defend its decision making process. 
Minister HOU said his food safety experts will release a 
report in the very near future repudiating the charges in the 
LY report. 
 
Report Summary 
-------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The draft report claims the U.S. pressured DOH to 
reopen the market without conducting proper risk assessments 
and ignored guidance from the Council of Agriculture.  It 
claims U.S. beef is still not safe for Taiwan consumers and 
could affect Taiwan's animal disease situation.  It 
recommends that those DOH officials who made the decision to 
reopen the market be punished and the market for US beef be 
immediately suspended.  However, Winston Dang, a DPP LY 
member and retired USG employee is drafting a separate 
report, which could moderate or significantly change the 
final report produced by the ad hoc investigative committee. 
 
DOH Decisions in-line with OIE International Standards 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶5.  (U) DIR Young commented that DOH decisions were made in 
accordance with international standards set by the OIE (The 
World Organization for Animal Health).  He explained Dr. 
Lambert would be meeting with COA and DOH officials next 
Monday to update them on BSE safeguards in the United States 
and to inform them of the recent U.S. petition to the OIE for 
a risk status classification for U.S. beef.  This OIE 
classification, expected in the spring of 2007, will 
recognize all types of U.S. beef, including bone-in, as 
safe-to-trade.  The Director stressed U.S. companies would 
not export any products to Taiwan not deemed safe by U.S. 
authorities.  Minister HOU expressed his appreciation for 
 
support from AIT's Agricultural Section and for Dr. Lambert's 
visit next Monday. 
 
Hou Seeks U.S. Support 
---------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU)  In a private pull aside at the conclusion of the 
meeting, Hou privately sought the Director's assistance to 
persuade former President Lee Teng-hui, KMT Chairman Ma 
Ying-jeou and LY Speaker Wang Jin-pyng not to allow the 
"zealots" in the LY to attack DOH and its decision to 
authorize U.S. beef imports for personal political purposes. 
While the Director was noncommittal on just what support he 
would offer, he did tell the Minister the U.S. remains 
comfortable with the science behind Taiwan's decision to open 
its market to U.S. beef.  He noted, too, Japan's later 
decision to re-open its market to U.S. beef, underscores the 
validity of Taiwan's decision to follow OIE guidelines in 
assessing the subject. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Comment:  Given that Hou will not be able to meet 
Lambert during his visit, the Director requested Vice 
Minister Wang to attend the meeting so she would be fully 
briefed when she meets Lambert.  The Director will be giving 
a speech on November 21 to the American Chamber of Commerce 
in Taipei and plans to include a comment supporting Taiwan's 
sound, scientific process in reopening its market to U.S. 
beef.  End Comment.
