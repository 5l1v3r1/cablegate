BRASILIA 00002419  001.2 OF 005 
 
¶1.  In FY 07, the South America Hub will continue to work both 
regionally and with individual missions to support USG ESTH 
priorities within the region.  Due to the large number of free trade 
and environmental cooperation agreements in the region, the Hub will 
devote considerably more energy and resources to those activities. 
Working within the new framework for foreign assistance and 
promoting our various partnerships in the region will also be 
priority areas for the Hub.  The following work plan is not all 
inclusive, but illustrates the primary activities that will be the 
focus of the Hub during FY-07.  END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------- 
Goals and Objectives 
-------------------- 
 
¶2.  Support efforts to implement U.S./Chile Environmental 
Cooperation Agreement Work Program.  Explore opportunities for 
partnerships with Chile on the work program projects and with 
expanding these programs to other countries in the region.  Support 
individual project development, e.g., establishment of Sister Parks 
arrangement between Torres del Paine and Yosemite and the 
development of the judicial training program.  Metric:  Number of 
ECA Work Program projects implemented; number of projects 
implemented that include regional component.  Torres del 
Paine/Yosemite Sister Parks arrangement concluded and have at least 
one visit from Yosemite to Torres del Paine. 
 
¶3.  Support development and implementation of ECA Work Plans in Peru 
and Colombia.  Metric:  ECA's are signed and ratified.  Meetings 
begin in both Peru and Colombia and basic work plans are 
constructed.  Initial activities take place. 
 
¶4.  Use Chile Sister Parks program to reinvigorate 
Pantanal-Everglades sister parks program in Brazil and expand this 
program to include Paraguay and Bolivia as well.  Metric:  Hold 
meeting in Pantanal with all three governments to go over type of 
MOU or LOA they would need with the Everglades.  NOTE:  This would 
 
BRASILIA 00002419  002.2 OF 005 
 
 
necessitate additional funding to bring the participants together 
unless we worked this agreement bilaterally with each country.  END 
NOTE. 
 
¶5.  Conduct Voluntary Visitor program for forestry professors 
together with USAID and the Tropical Forest Trust.  Metric:  Send 10 
professors to the US and obtain training.  Increased treatment of 
non-traditional forestry issues such as certification and the 
utilization of lesser known species in their courses.  Increased 
cooperation between US Forest Service and national forestry programs 
in South America. 
 
¶6.  ESTH, Mission Planning and Foreign Assistance Reform:  Actively 
engage and serve as a resource to ESTHOff's and USAID environment 
programs in advocating for inclusion of ESTH issues in Mission 
Strategic Plans and in Foreign Assistance Operating Plans.  Metric: 
Number of MSPs addressing ESTH issues; Resources allocated for 
ESTH-related foreign assistance programming. 
 
¶7.  Wildlife Trafficking and Other Environmental Crime:  Support 
expansion and implementation of CAWT initiative in the Western 
Hemisphere, pursuant to OES direction.  Work with Venezuela, 
Colombia, and Bolivia (among others) through NAS to sponsor wildlife 
trafficking programs using the Brazil program as a model.  Build on 
Chile's leadership of CITES General Standing Committee, ECA Work 
Program focus on wildlife trafficking, and interest in CAWT, to 
engage them as reliable partners in the region.  Metric:  Hold the 
wildlife trafficking training then conduct  six month follow-up see 
that they are still capable of conducting operations.  Partners 
added to CAWT depending on interest from OES.  In addition, report 
on any anecdotal information in the region on successful 
anti-trafficking campaigns, and of linkages between wildlife 
trafficking or other environmental crimes and other types of 
international crimes (drugs, TIP) and official corruption. 
 
¶8.  Support Paraguay/Brazil efforts to build environmental 
enforcement cooperation in follow up to 2006 training in Ciudad del 
Este.  Metric:  Increased cooperation in tri-border region as 
measured by meetings and enforcement activities. 
 
¶9.  New intranet website for Hub to compile ESTH information in a 
more user friendly format.  Metric:  Website populated and kept up 
to date through end of fiscal year.  Positive feedback from users.

supportive role played by the Amazon Country Treaty Organization.

and work closely with OES Points of Contact to fulfill the mission 
of each project.  Develop project proposals to support partnerships 
identified for OES funding in FY 07 and 08. 
 
¶13.  Work with Southcom on developing a South American-wide 
conference on environmental security issues.  Metric:  Conduct 
conference with not only mil-mil, but also civ-mil cooperation. 
Increase South-South cooperation on issues such as forest fire 
management. 
 
¶14.  Supporting S&T agreements and MOUs between governments in South 
America and USG technical agencies such as USGS.  Metric:  Signed 
MOU between Brazilian institutions and USGS.  Signed S&T agreement

General Resources Needed 
------------------------ 
 
¶20. As was indicated in an earlier message, depending on the amount 
of support the Hub needs to provide for the creation and 
implementation of the work plans in Peru and Colombia, we would be 
able to send an FSN from the Hub for extended TDYs to Peru and 
Colombia to work on these issues especially the formulation of the 
Environmental Commission and the implementation of the work plan. 
In our earlier message we indicated that if Peru and Colombia could 
provide office space and a TDY apartment, we could provide an FSN a 
total of 6 times for two weeks each time for approximately 10,000. 
Without the additional funding, the Hub will be able to visit, but 
will not have the flexibility to spend a total of 6 weeks in each 
country only working on these issues.
