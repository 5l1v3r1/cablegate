REF: KUWAIT 4265 
 
¶1.  (SBU) During an October 28 interview with Al-Rai Al-Aam 
(local Arabic daily), Ridha Mustafaei, the Media Attach at 
the Iranian Embassy in Kuwait, sharply attacked some Kuwaiti 
columnists for writing articles critical of Iran, 
specifically Iran's nuclear program and its role in Iraq. 
"We have noticed recently that some of the writers in the 
Kuwaiti press are interested in publishing lies and gossip 
against the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Iranian people 
to get a letter of thanks from foreign embassies," he said. 
Mustafaei claimed the columnists "repeat the words of the 
Israeli Prime Minister on Iran and justify the Zionist crimes 
against our fellow people in Qana," an apparent reference to 
the Israeli attack on Qana, Lebanon that resulted in tens of 
civilian deaths.  He said Iran "realized that such irregular 
opinions do not represent the Kuwaiti people" and that "the 
wise Kuwaiti leadership does not accept such cheap pens." 
Mustafaei concluded by emphasizing that Iran-Kuwait relations 
were in their "golden era." 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Kuwaiti Journalists Syndicate reacted strongly 
to Mustafaei's comments.  In a statement issued October 29, 
the syndicate called on Mustafaei to apologize, saying he had 
violated "the boundaries of diplomatic and media etiquette" 
and noting that "freedom of expression is guaranteed by the 
Kuwaiti constitution."  Several columnists also sharply 
criticized Mustafaei for his statements.  Columnist Fuad 
Al-Hashim called on the Foreign Minister to declare Mustafaei 
persona non grata and sent back to "the oasis of democracy 
(sarcasm) in the Islamic Republic where half of the 
journalists are in prison and the other half are rubber 
stamps."  Mustafaei later qualified his statements, saying he 
did not intend to insult all Kuwaiti press and was referring 
only to "one writer who declared that he had received a 
letter of thanks from the American administration for abusing 
Iran."
