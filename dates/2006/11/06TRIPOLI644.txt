SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR ASSISTANT SECRETARY MCMURRAY VISIT AND 
STATUS REPORT ON SCIENTIFIC COOPERATION WITH LIBYA 
 
REF: STATE 184185, TRIPOLI 476 
 
¶1.   Post warmly welcomes the visit of Assistant Secretary of 
State for the Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental 
and Scientific Affairs McMurray.  The following background 
information is provided in anticipation of your visit to Tripoli 
on November 11-13, 2006.   Our scientific engagement program is 
the most active segment of bilateral cooperation, with ongoing 
work in biological life sciences, mechanical engineering, water 
management, nuclear medicine, radioactive waste management and 
other areas.  As with all other delegations, the meeting 
schedule has not been confirmed at this time.  Typically, 
schedule changes take place up until minutes before a meeting 
commences.  Post anticipates that you will have meetings the 
evening of Saturday, November 11 with physicians at the Libyan 
Board of Medical Specialities to discuss telemedicine and 
sub-speciality training .   The morning of Sunday, November 12, 
we are trying to confirm a meeting with Ahmed Fitouri, the 
Secretary of American Affairs at the General People's Committee 
 
SIPDIS 
for Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation (MFA 
equivalent) .  In addition, you tentatively have meetings 
scheduled with Matouq Matouq, the Secretary of the General 
People's Committee for Manpower, Training, and Employment and 
Ahmed Shembesh, the Director of the Libyan National Center for 
Standardization and Metrology.   The afternoon of November 12, 
there may be meetings at the Libyan General Water Authority, the 
Libyan Environment Authority and the Libyan Renewable Energy 
Center.   Since the actual order of the schedule will vary 
considerably, and as a follow up to the July 2006 agreement 
signed by the U.S. and Libya concerning science and technology 
cooperation, this cable follows the format of the signed 
agreement, and the two should be read in tandem.   You will be 
briefed upon arrival with the latest version of the schedule.

Disease Control, NAMRU-3, Bio-Ethics, and Libyan Board of 
Medical Specialities. 
 
--------- 
AVIAN INFLUENZA 
--------- 
 
 ¶2.  During the July 11-13 2006 visit of U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services (HHS) Deputy Secretary Alex Azar, an 
agreement was signed with the General People's Committee for 
Health and Environment (GPCHE) to participate in a cooperative 
initiative for the development of public health and security, 
with particular reference to public health incidents related to 
influenza.  Attached to this agreement was an offer by HHS to 
provide the GPCHE a non-competitive grant in the amount of USD$1 
Million to foster this cooperation through continued 
partnerships in disease surveillance, preparedness and response 
capabilities.  The grant was authorized on August 29th 2006, and 
filed with Health and Human Services.  Jane Coury of HHS is 
finalizing the contract and delivering the monies to the 
Libyans, and will be returning to Libya on November 11-13 to 
continue discussions with Dr. AbduHafid Abudher of the Libyan 
(African) Center for Infectious Disease Control (ACIDC.)  For 
further details, please reference TRIPOLI 476, dated September 
07, 2006.  Key staff of the GPCHE: Secretary Dr. Mohamed Rashed, 
Under Secretary Mr. Habeb Tamer. 
 
 --------- 
AFRICAN CENTER FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONTROL: 
--------- 
 
 ¶3.  The scientific engagement program has facilitated 
continuing contact with the African Center for Infectious 
Disease Control (ACIDC) and its various offices and personnel. 
The ACIDC is also the technical point of contact in implementing 
the HHS Pandemic Influenza Assistance  (USD 1 Million.)  The 
main point of contact within the ACIDC is Dr. Abduhafid Abudher. 
 Dr. Abudher also oversees the Tripoli tuberculosis screening 
center, and Tripoli regional ACIDC center. 
 
 --------- 
NAMRU-3: 
--------- 
 ¶4.  The Navy Medical Research Unit number 3 (NAMRU-3) based in 
Cairo, Egypt has been instrumental in engaging the Libyan 
Biological Life Sciences community.  NAMRU-3 invited several 
Libyan biological scientists to study pathogen handling 
techniques, sampling techniques disease surveillance workshops 
and other valuable technical and scientific training programs. 
They are now routinely hosting teams of 2-5 Libyan scientists at 
their Cairo based facility for courses runing ne-furweek. 
In dition, the staff of NAMRU-3 have made themselves available 
to assist in other medical / bio programs within Libya.  Dr. 
Bruce Boynton visited Tripoli as part of the Trilateral Steering 
Committee Biological Subcommittee, and Dr. Mustafa Mansour, a 
dual Egyptian/U.S. citizen has made himself available in the 
proposal submission for the HHS Pandemic Influenza program.  In 
addition, Dr. Marie Ricciardone, a former NAMRU-3 scientist, and 
current NP/PTR officer provides continuity and follow up for the 
Libyan biological science community through the scientist 
engagement program. 
 
 --------- 
BIO-ETHICS, BIO-SAFETY: 
--------- 
 
 ¶5.  The Trilateral Steering Committee Biological Subcommittee, 
under the direction of Chair Catharine T. Crittenberger has been 
the chief engine for engagement of the Libyan biological science 
community.  She routinely meets with the Libyan Permanent 
Committee on Bioethics and Biosafety (LPCBB) and is currently 
overseeing the Libyan establishment of a comprehensive Bioethics 
/ Biosafety legislation.  Her chief interlocutors are Dr. 
Mohamed Sharif, Manager of the LPCBB, and Dr. Abdurrahman Tawil, 
LPCBB board member. 
 
 --------- 
LIBYAN BOARD OF MEDICAL SPECIALTIES / TELEMEDICINE: 
--------- 
 
 ¶6.  On August 30, 2006, ESTH officer and Dr. Mustafa Mansour of 
the Navy Medical Research Unit 3 (NAMRU 3) in Cairo, visited the 
Libyan Board of Medical Specialties to follow up on the July 
visit of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Deputy 
Secretary Alex Azar.  DepSec Azar and the Board agreed to 
 
SIPDIS 
collaborate, expand and improve Libya's medical board 
certification process with particular attention to creating 
recognized certifications in sub-specialties.  The Libyans were 
challenged by ESTH officer to determine what sort of cooperation 
or workshop programs would benefit the board, and they responded 
with two reasonable proposals.  The first was a basic discussion 
on the benefits, feasibility and technology associated with a 
telemedicine program.  The second proposal was for the Libyans 
to fully fund a series of workshop visits by U.S. physicians, 
capable of conducting sub-specialty focused workshops in a 
continuing education capacity, with a secondary goal of 
discussing and evaluating the board certification criteria in 
the relevant sub-specialty during the visit.  The Libyans have 
offered to provide funding for visiting physicians from the U.S. 
to both teach the local physician population, as well as 
evaluate the board process and certification criteria of medical 
sub-specialists.  Meetings will be scheduled with Jane Coury 
and/or A/S McMurray as appropriate during their November 11-13 
visit to Tripoli.

ENVIRONMENT / WATER 
--------- 
See subtopics of Libyan Environment Authority, Desalination 
Research, Nuclear Powered Desalination, Quality Monitoring and 
Education. 
 
 --------- 
LIBYAN ENVIRONMENT AUTHORITY: 
--------- 
 
 ¶8.  During the July 2006 visit of Under Secretary of State for 
Democracy and Global Affairs Paula Dobriansky, she and her 
delegation met with Dr. Abul-Hakim Al-Waer, Secretary of the 
Libyan Environment Authority (LEA).  They discussed issues of 
water, general environment, fisheries and standards and 
metrology.  In September 2006, Dr. Al-Waer approached the NDF 
chemical weapons destruction assistance team and indicated an 
interest/need for a program to destroy / incinerate / neutralize 
several caustic and hazardous agents/wastes in accordance with 
various environmental agreements to which they had either 
signed, or aspire to sign.  These items for destruction included 
PCB's, transformer oil, pesticides left from Italian residents 
in the 1930's, and hazardous medical wastes.  Dr. Waer desires 
to establish a solution to the immediate problem of existing 
waste stockpiles, with additional consideration of disposing of 
future waste.  Dr. Waer said he had a budget of LD 57 Million in 
2007 funds to address this disposal problem, (including PCB's, 
Medical Waste and other hazardous wastes) and would be seeking 
solutions in 2007/2008. 
 
 --------- 
WATER: DESALINATION RESEARCH: 
--------- 
 
 ¶9.  The National Bureau for Research and Development (NBRD), 
headed by Dr. Ali Gashut oversees the Renewable Energy and Water 
Desalination Research Center (REWDRC.)  The REWDRC oversees 
research into various desalination technologies including 
filtration technologies membranes and reverse osmosis 
technologies and staging various thermal and filtering 
technologies.  The center is currently focusing on the 
production of 1200 m3/day desalination units for use in Libya's 
rural communities not currently serviced by the Great Man Made 
River Authority, with the goal of eventually making these 
technologies the preferred method of water production/delivery. 
 
 --------- 
WATER: NUCLEAR POWERED DESAL UNITS: 
--------- 
 
 ¶10.  The means of powering desalination systems in Libya 
remains an interesting debate within and out of Libya.  Engineer 
Matug Mohammed Matug, Secretary of the General People's 
Committee for Manpower, Employment and Training, as well as 
supervisor of the NBRD and REWDRC continues to request a nuclear 
powered water desalination unit as a long term solution for 
Libya's water requirements.  Even though traditional combustion 
and turbomachinery techniques for powering desalination 
technologies are well within the grasp of the Libyans, and fuel 
supplies are virtually unlimited, they continue to raise this 
point as an area for potential cooperation with high-ranking 
U.S. delegations.  Internally there is some debate about this 
method as well, in that the Libyan leadership does not want 
Libya to be the pioneer of this technology.  Libya wants to see 
another country prove the concept's feasibility before it 
invests in the technology. 
 
 --------- 
WATER: QUALITY MONITORING: 
--------- 
 
 ¶11.  U.S. Specialists in water quality have been engaging the 
Libyans via the Libyan General Water Authority (GWA) and the 
NBRD water quality laboratories.  These two entities oversee 
water quality testing at central laboratories with sampling 
sites spread throughout Libya.  The current lab for the GWA is 
not well equipped, and one of the lead researchers recently 
deceased.  Experts from Lawrence Livermore Laboratories and 
Sandia National Labs recently visited both lab facilities and 
are engaging in cooperation projects.  The NBRD is building a 
new water quality laboratory, and the LLNL and Sandia Labs 
representatives are providing assistance in planning and 
construction of the facility. 
 
 --------- 
WATER: EDUCATION: 
--------- 
 
 ¶12.  Post is developing a "Water Capacity Building Study Tour" 
through the voluntary visitor program in cooperation with Dr. 
Ricciardone at Embassy Cairo and NEA/RA.  The program is 
tentatively scheduled for February 2007.  There are both 
environmental science and geology programs available at Al-Fateh 
University, and graduate programs in environment and water 
science available through the Academy for Graduate Studies 
(AGS).  Dr. Saad Al-Ghariani, a former UC Davis student, and 
Staff Member of the AGS is a cooperative interlocutor concerning 
the state of Environmental and Water education, and is 
frequently available to discuss water and water policy with 
visiting delegations. 
 
 --------- 
WATER:  WHERE THE U.S. HAS NOT ENGAGED: 
--------- 
 
 ¶13.  The many fact finding and technical delegations that have 
visited Libya have understandably been involved in programs 
focused primarily on enhanced engagement with Libyan scientists 
from nuclear, chemical and biological backgrounds.  Other 
entities within Libya that have a focus on water and water 
legislation have not been as actively engaged such as the 
General People's Committee for Agriculture, Animals and Water 
Resources (GPCA), and the Great Man Made River Authority 
(GMMRA).  Programming is not currently underway with the GMMRA, 
primarily as it is a well-funded and fairly self-sufficient 
entity.  The GMMRA positions and input will become increasingly 
important, however, as Libya creeps toward a unified water 
policy.  The GMMRA is naturally less interested in desalination 
technology than pumping from existing aquifers, but should be 
brought to the table to discuss Libya's larger strategy.  The 
GPCA has not been engaged primarily because they are viewed as a 
customer or consumer.  Again, as a unified policy on water 
management becomes a reality, the largest users/consumers are 
going to need to provide input. 
 
 --------- 
COMMERCIAL/TRADE and TRANSPORTATION: 
--------- 
See subtopics of updated trade export restrictions, Boeing 
Commercial Advocacy, Civil Aviation, and Conferences. 
 
--------- 
UPDATED TRADE EXPORT RESTRICTIONS: 
--------- 
 
 ¶14.  The U.S. Department of Commerce published an amendment to 
the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) that apply to Libya. 
 This change removed the requirement for a license to export or 
re-export items controlled for anti-terrorism (AT) reasons. 
With the change, items such as most computers, software, 
telecommunications equipment and vehicles can be exported to 
Libya without a Commerce export license.  The BIS team addressed 
questions about the EAR change, which put Libya on a par with 
most US export destinations, noting that many of the commodities 
being checked would no longer require licenses for export and 
re-export to Libya. 
 
 --------- 
BOEING COMMERCIAL ADVOCACY 
--------- 
 
 ¶15.  Dr. David Sampson, Deputy Secretary for U.S. Department of 
Commerce visited the Libyan General People's Committee for 
Economy Trade and Investment (GPCETI) and discussed economic 
policy and trade issues.  Among the issues discussed were the 
September 2006 restructuring of export restrictions to Libya, 
and the acquisition of Boeing passenger aircraft by Baraq 
Airlines in Libya.  Boeing Advocacy also took place during a 
recent EXIM Bank and BIS visits. 
 
¶16.  Buraq received its first new Boeing aircraft, a 
medium-range airplane 737-800 dubbed "Tripoli" on October 30. 
This delivery marked the first brand new commercial aircraft 
purchased by any Libyan airline since 1979.   A ceremony on the 
occasion of its arrival at Tripoli International Airport was 
held the evening of October 30, attended by the Charge and 
representatives from Boeing, Secretary of Cooperation Affairs at 
GPC for Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation, Secretary 
of People's Committee for Civil Aviation Department, the 
Director of Tripoli International Airport, the Director of Air 
Transport Department and members of the press.  A second 737-800 
("Benghazi") is due to be delivered on November 15, and a third 
is expected in early 2007.  Buraq has options to purchase three 
more 737-800's, but is considering exchanging the options for 
one to purchase a wide body plane. 
 
-------- 
CIVIL AVIATION: 
--------- 
 
¶17.  In addition to the GPCETI, DepSec Sampson met with Dr. 
Mohamed Schlebik, the Director General of the Libyan Civil 
Aviation Authority, under the General People's Committee for 
Post Transport and Telecommunications (GPCPTT).  They discussed 
cooperation in air traffic control equipment, runway refinishing 
and unification of weather database and tracking systems.  In 
September 2006, the regional manager for Raytheon in North 
Africa visited Dr. Schlebik and is engaging in ongoing 
discussions concerning civil aviation product sales to Libya. 
The door to the civil aviation market remains open to other U.S. 
manufacturers. 
 
 --------- 
CONFERENCES PROMOTING COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITIES IN LIBYA 2006: 
--------- 
 
¶18.  The second annual Libyan Aviation Exposition 2006 (LAVEX), 
scheduled for December 04-07 2006 in Tripoli's Ma'atiqa Airfield 
will provide opportunities for U.S. aerospace manufacturers to 
demonstrate U.S. equipment as well as broker introductions 
between U.S. manufacturers and Libyan decision makers.  More 
than 35 Libyan and foreign companies are expected to 
participate, including U.S. firms Augusta, Africair and 
Raytheon.  European defense firms are expected to make a strong 
showing at the exhibition, including Airbus, Eurocopter, 
Dassault Aviation, Thales, Warner Lewis, Safran, MBDA and 
sevaral Russian companies. 
 
In addition, during the same dates, two simultaneous civilian / 
commercial expositions will take place in Tripoli: 
 
 --Project Libya Energy Exposition:  An International Oil, Gas, 
Power and Renewable Energy Exhibition Forum sponsored by the GPC 
for Industry, Electricity and Mines, National Oil Corporation 
and the General Electric Company of Libya (GECOL). 
 
 --Project Libya Infrastructure Exhibition:  An International 
Exhibition and Forum for Libya's Infrastructure sponsored by the 
GPC for Planning, the General Board of Infrastructure and Urban 
Development, and the Inspector General of Housing and Utilities. 
 
The Project Libya exhibitions are sponsored by Dr. Aisha Muammar 
Al-Qadhafi through her Wa'atassemo Foundation (Aisha is the 
Daughter of the Libyan Leader Mu'anmmar al-Qadhafi.)
