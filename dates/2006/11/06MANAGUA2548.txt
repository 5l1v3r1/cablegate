¶1. (SBU) Summary: Evangelical leaders recently pledged to 
continue to support the Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance (ALN), 
led by Eduardo Montealegre, as long as that party continues 
to uphold Christian values.  The reverends noted that 
Montealegre has a chance to consolidate the party and draw 
more disenchanted voters from the Liberal Constitutional 
Party (PLC).  Regarding the victory of Sandinista Front 
(FSLN) candidate Daniel Ortega in the November 5 elections, 
the leaders are hoping for continued positive relations with 
the USG, but are not optimistic about the country's long-term 
prosperity.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Poloffs met with leaders of the Nicaraguan 
Evangelical Association, the Reverends Mauricio Fonseca 
Pereira, Mauricio Orue Vasquez, Guillermo Ayala, and Danilo 
Ortiz Zelaya, to discuss the outcome of the November 5 
national elections.  The reverends noted that Daniel Ortega 
won with a minority of the vote.  They characterized the 
elections as a victory for the ALN and a defeat for the PLC, 
which saw its legislative strength halved.  Fonseca described 
ALN candidate Eduardo Montealegre as a "hero" for building a 
political alternative to the corrupt FSLN and PLC, and stated 
that the ALN's success has permanently altered the political 
landscape in Nicaragua by proving that a third party can 
attract votes. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The reverends claimed that a majority of evangelical 
Christians (which they estimate constitute about 40 percent 
of Nicaragua's population) supported the ALN.  (Note: Other 
estimates of the evangelical population range from 25 to 35 
percent.  End Note.)  They mentioned a compact signed with 
Montealegre outlining mutual interests and values -- a first 
for a Nicaraguan Presidential candidate.  Ayala stated that 
increasing numbers of evangelicals, and Nicaraguans in 
general, will support the ALN as long as the party "stays 
clean."  The reverends predicted that many of the PLC's 
grassroots voters will now see that party as based on lies 
and fear mongering and will switch allegiance to the ALN. 
 
¶4. (SBU) When asked about the impact of Ortega's victory on 
Nicaragua, the reverends commented that Nicaraguans are 
taking a "wait and see" attitude, especially regarding the 
economy and continued investment.  "We pray for good 
relations with the U.S.," said Orue.  Fonseca stated that the 
FSLN will have a "one year honeymoon" with investors and 
foreign governments before "sucking the marrow" out of the 
common people to enrich themselves.  Ayala commented that the 
type of leaders that show up for the inauguration of Ortega 
will indicate the future path of the FSLN regime.  He 
wondered aloud whether leaders like Fidel Castro and Hugo 
Chavez would take center stage. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Reverend Fonseca mentioned that Jehovah's Witnesses, 
a growing denomination in Nicaragua, do not vote out of 
religious conviction.  He estimated that the denomination has 
about 100,000 adherents in the country.  Some of the other 
reverends reported that Jehovah's Witnesses were also 
encouraging other evangelicals not to vote. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment: The evangelicals, a growing segment of the 
population, have formed a solid base of support for the ALN. 
One key indicator of the ALN's continued viability will be 
whether or not Montealegre can continue to successfully 
manage relations with this group by prioritizing evangelical 
outreach within the party.
