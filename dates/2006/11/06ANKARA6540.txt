¶1.  The Turkish MFA told us that the Government of Turkey 
(Ministries of Health or Agriculture) will not be participating in 
the reftel Bamako Conference on Avian and Pandemic Influenza 
December 6-8.  The Ministry of Health and the local WHO 
representative confirmed this information.  Turkey perceives the 
conference as focused on Africa. 
 
¶2.  Turkey remains committed to leveraging its experiences as a 
Europe-Caucasus-Middle East regional model.  The MOH told us that 
the GOT will be working with WHO to organize a regional AI 
conference in March 2007.
