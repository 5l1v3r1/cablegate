FORCES 
 
REF:  N'DJAMENA 1281 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Despite talk of reconciliation 
between Chad and Sudan, the Chad/Sudan border north of 
the Abeche corridor appears to be the scene of 
continued tension between Chadian and Sudanese forces. 
End Summary. 
 
GOS VS GOC AT THE BORDER 
------------------------ 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Head of UNHCR's Iriba Field Office 
reported in a November 7 conversation with Poloff that 
the Sudanese Government of National Unity (GNU) is 
waging both visible and behind-the-scenes campaigns 
against the Government of Chad (GOC).  Authorities in 
the border market town of Tine, for example, confirmed 
to UNHCR the October 26-27 bombardments by the Sudanese 
Armed Forces (SAF) of the villages of Ouudour, Bamena 
(1.5 km inside Chadian territory from the Sudan border) 
and Keles (3km from the Sudan border and 27 km from 
Tine proper).  Tine authorities reported at least ten 
killed and four wounded in the Keles bombing. (Comment: 
This information supercedes that in reftel which 
reported that the Sudanese bombing could not be 
confirmed.  End Comment).  Other Embassy sources have 
told us that buildups are taking place near Bahai where 
Chadian National Army (ANT) and elements of the 
Sudanese-rebel National Redemption Front (NRF) are 
facing off against the SAF and elements of the Chadian 
rebel movement. 
 
¶3. (SBU) UNHCR described a virtual face-to-face stand- 
off between the SAF and the ANT in Tine, with only a 
wadi (a seasonal watercourse) separating forces of both 
sides.  Given this proximity and accompanying 
escalation of tensions, rumors of further cross-border 
attacks abound.  According to UNHCR, the Iriba Police 
Commissioner told them of alleged plans by the 
Janjaweed to attack Tine to drive Chadian civilians out 
so that the militias could raid its commercial centers; 
however, such an attack has not yet materialized. 
 
GNU EFFORTS TO CONSOLIDATE CHADIAN REBELLION 
-------------------------------------------- 
¶4. (SBU) According to UNHCR, when not employing the SAF 
or reportedly inciting the Janjaweed to carry out its 
military campaigns against the GOC, the GNU is actively 
engaged in consolidating elements of the Chadian 
rebellion. The GNU allegedly hosted a November 3 
meeting in El Geneina in which members of the Chadian 
SCUD rebel group were asked to join the UFDD-led 
alliance, which aims to install former Chadian Defense 
Minister Mahamat Nouri as Chadian President.  Four SCUD 
members refused the invitation on the grounds that they 
would not support a member of the Goran tribe (to which 
Nouri belongs) as President.    At least two of the 
four, COL Abakar Kessou and COL Mouktar Brahim Nargas, 
were reportedly killed by Sudanese "death squads" after 
this refusal. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
¶5. (SBU) Rumors abound concerning the situation at the 
border, and we have taken this one with a grain of 
salt.  However, if the murder of these two SCUD members 
is true, this report would indicate that the GNU is 
losing patience with the rag-tag nature of the Chadian 
rebellion and is actively seeking to make it a more 
credible threat to the Deby regime.  The GOS efforts 
may also run the risk of fragmenting them further.
