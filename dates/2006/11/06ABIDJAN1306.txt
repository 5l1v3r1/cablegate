¶1.  On November 20, the National Institute for Public Hygiene 
in Cote d'Ivoire (INHP) confirmed results by the National 
Laboratory for Agricultural Development (LANADA) on November 
17 of another instance of H5N1 Avian Influenza (AI) in Cote 
d'Ivoire.  Culling began November 21, as 76 birds were 
slaughtered in and around the infected backyard poultry farms 
situated about 15 kilometers from Bingerville  The first 
turkey died from AI on November 9, and nine more followed 
within days.  The last previous case of AI in Cote d'Ivoire 
had been reported in June (reftel). 
 
¶2.  After the investigation, launched on November 21, three 
people in close contact with the infected birds will be kept 
under surveillance for any symptoms of infection for the next 
two to three weeks.  General surveillance in the district of 
Bingerville will result in reports made on a daily and weekly 
basis.  Thus far, no human transmission of AI has been 
observed. 
 
¶3.  Post will continue to monitor the developing situation 
closely.  Post point of contact for AI is Economic Officer 
Erfana Dar (225.22.49.4602).
