In a November 21 meeting, poloff urged the GOM to send a 
delegation headed by the highest possible official to attend 
the BMENA Forum for the Future at the Dead Sea, drawing on 
points contained reftel.   Bilateral Affairs officer Karim 
Halim expected but could not officially confirm that the 
Moroccan delegation would be led by Taieb Fassi Fihri, 
Minister-Delegate for Foreign Affairs.  Halim noted that 
Fihri has been deeply engaged in the BMENA process since the 
GOM hosted the inaugural Forum for the Future in 2004. 
Youssef Amrani, the MFA's Director General for Bilateral 
Affairs, will attend, he added.   Embassy assesses that Fassi 
Fihri, who is very close to King Mohammed VI and is closely 
associated with his reform plans, would be an excellent 
interlocutor at the Forum.
