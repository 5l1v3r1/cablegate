REF: SECSTATE 188253 
 
(U) Econoff delivered reftel demarche regarding the UNESCO 
Conventions on Cultural Expressions to Peter Noble, Deputy 
Director for United Nations and Commonwealth Issues at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) and to Bronwyn 
Turley, Policy Advisor for IP Issues at the Ministry of 
Economic Development (MED). Post stressed the concern that 
the Convention contains ambiguous language regarding its

and obligation. Post will inform State of any further 
reaction by MFAT and MED.
