ROLLOVER 
 
¶1. Summary: DPKO Assistant Secretary-General Hedi Annabi and 
the Secretary-General's Personal Envoy for Western Sahara 
Peter van Walsum summarized for the Security Council October 
25 the UN's latest assessment of the situation in the Western 
Sahara.  Speaking for the United States, Ambassador Sanders 
expressed support for the Secretary-General's recommendation 
to extend MINURSO for another six months, while cautioning 
that "continuation is tied to progress" and that negotiations 
ought be conducted in "the spirit of flexibility."  The 
majority of Council members also expressed support for a 
six-month extension, although several cited the need for 
dialogue between the parties and the imperative of 
self-determination for the Sahwari, and many expressed 
concern about the human rights situation in Western Sahara. 
End Summary. 
 
¶2. Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) Assistant 
Secretary-General Hedi Annabi highlighted three aspects of 
 
SIPDIS 
the most recent "Report of the Secretary-General on the 
situation concerning Western Sahara" (Document S/2006/817 
available at www.un.org/Docs/sc/sgrep06): the limited access 
to Moroccan and Polisario military bases available to the 
MINURSO military observers; alleged human rights abuses; and 
the need for continued implementation of confidence building 
measures.  The Secretary-General's Personal Envoy for Western 
Sahara Peter van Walsum spoke only to reiterate that the UN 
position on Western Sahara remained as he had described it 
earlier in the year: one of passive encouragement.  He 
characterized the UN as taking a "step back" so as to allow 
the parties to carry out their responsibilities.  He 
emphasized UN support for the attainment of a mutually 
acceptable political solution vice a continuation of the 
status quo, which he deemed unacceptable. 
 
¶3. Council members generally supported the 
Secretary-General's report and most indicated they would 
 
SIPDIS 
support a six-month rollover of the MINURSO mandate.  But 
Council members, in their statements, also underlined their 
concerns on a number of issues.  A number of countries, 
reflecting their reading of a leaked OHCHR report critical of 
Morocco, said that the UN should continue close monitoring of 
the human rights situation in Western Sahara (Qatar, Ghana, 
Argentina, Denmark, Greece, Peru, France, Slovakia and 
Congo).  Several countries reminded the Council of the 
importance of the principle of self-determination for the 
people of Western Sahara (Argentina, Denmark, Peru, Tanzania 
and Slovakia.  Several countries also urged that 
unconditional dialogue begin between the parties (China, 
Argentina, Denmark, Greece, Tanzania and UK).  Finally, a 
number of countries urged an expanded program of confidence 
building measures (Argentina, Denmark, Peru and France).
