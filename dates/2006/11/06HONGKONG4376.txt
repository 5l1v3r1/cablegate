(U) Post has informed all employees and their families of the need 
to prepare themselves in the event of pandemic influenza. 
Specifically, we have provided guidance through our website, 
Administrative Notices, and a town hall forum to inform staff of the 
need to maintain emergency food stocks.  Post has sufficient MRE 
stocks in place for a limited population.  Lastly, the Hong Kong 
water supply is potable and, therefore, storage of 12-weeks worth of 
emergency stock for all post families is not required.  Post's AI 
Working Group continues to meet regularly both internally and with 
Hong Kong authorities.  We post AI information widely on our website 
and distribute AI information to employees through the Health Unit 
and CLO newsletter.  We also distribute important AI information to 
the American community in Hong Kong through the American Citizens 
Services unit (ACS).
