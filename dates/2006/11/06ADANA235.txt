SUBJECT: SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY FOR OCTOBER 31, 2006 
 
 
This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary for October 31,

POLITICAL 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:   DTP offices in the western part of Turkey and 
in the southeastern region held meetings in Izmir, Van and 
Diyarbakir to discuss the cease-fire process.  Separately, DTP 
National Chairperson Ahmet Turk said that the ultimate goal 
should be to achieve disarmament and to create a serious medium 
to discuss the issue, until May.  Turk reiterated that the 
cease-fire process was indefinite. 
 
¶4.      ZAMAN:  According to the daily, DTP has intensified 
its efforts to solve the Kurdish issue through democratic means: 
 DTP officials decided to discuss the issue with the political 
parties including CHP and MHP.  DTP will also talk with civil 
society organizations such as TUSIAD (Turkish Association for 
Industrialists and Businessmen) and TOBB (Turkish Union of 
Chambers and Commodity Exchanges). 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM: (Reported on Sunday) The daily reports that the 
villagers in a village of Sirnak's Uludere district caught three 
JITEM (Jandarma Intelligence) members in civilian clothes who, 
according to the villagers, were surveying the area around the 
village for nearly three weeks.  As the villagers alleged that 
they saw three Kalashnikov guns, hand grenades, munitions and 
some documents in the trunk of the car, the daily reported that 
the villagers were concerned that the JITEM members were in the 
area to perpetrate mysterious bombings, similar to the bombing 
that took place on November 9, 2005 in Semdinli.   The online 
version of the daily alleges that the jandarma blockaded the 
village as they came to take away the JITEM members and put 
pressure on the villagers to give back a document that 
disappeared from the car of the JITEM members. (This summary is 
from 10/29 edition.) 
 
HURIYET:  (Reported on Sunday) The daily reports the tension 
that erupted between jandarma intelligence members and villagers 
in Uludere.   The villagers reportedly stopped the car of three 
officers who told the villagers that they were members of 
jandarma intelligence unit.  As the tension escalated, the 
Jandarma Commander, whom the officers called, came to the scene 
and sent the officers away.  Sirnak Governor announced that 
tension broke out as the officers were gathering information 
about smuggling in the area. No fighting or beatings took place 
during the event. (This summary is from 10/29 edition.) 
 
¶5.      EVRENSEL:       Following the tension that broke out between 
alleged JITEM members and villagers in Sirnak's Uludere district 
over the weekend, the villagers claimed that a commander was 
putting pressure on the villagers in the district by voicing his 
plans to evacuate the villages located along the border. 
 
SECURITY 
 
¶6.      OZGUR GUNDEM:   PKK made an announcement about death of

clash. 
 
¶7.      OZGUR GUNDEM:    A thermos detected as left unattended 
in front of a shop in a quarter of Diyarbakir caused panic among 
people who feared that it might be a bomb.  Police safely 
detonated it and found out that it was not a bomb. 
 
¶8.      EVRENSEL / OZGUR GUNDEM / ZAMAN:        The daily reports that 
the news about an alleged attack on a jandarma station in Van's 
Gurpinar district circulating in the media has been falsified by 
the subgovernor of the district.  The soldier that was said to 
have been wounded in that attack actually wounded himself as a 
result of an accident.
