SUBJECT: EXBS: TURKEY DECLINES INVITATION TO PARTICIPATE IN 
WORKSHOP ON THE ENFORCEMENT OF EXPORT CONTROLS ON STRATEGIC 
COMMODITIES 
 
REF: STATE 174810 
 
¶1.  Per reftel, we forwarded the invitation for the GOT to 
send two participants to the Middle East Regional Technical 
Exchange on the Export Controls of Strategic Commodities 
being held in Amman, Jordan in December 2006.  Subsequently, 
we emphasized to MFA Disarmament and Arms Control Head of 
Department Ahmet Gun the U.S. belief that Turkey's 
accomplishments in the area of export controls and their 
training of officials would greatly benefit other workshop 
participants. 
 
¶2.  On November 20, we were notified by Serhan Yigit of the 
MFA Disarmament and Arms Control staff that Turkey would not 
participate in the Amman workshop.  Yigit informed us that he 
had been in close contact with both Turkish Customs and 
Turkish Atomic Energy Authority concerning their decisions to 
not participate, but it was determined that other high 
priority issues would prevent Turkish experts in the export 
control field from attending.  Yigit acknowledged that this 
would be a missed opportunity for Turkish experts to interact 
with others in the region; however the MFA did not feel it 
appropriate to force participation by the related 
institutions.  Yigit offered that the GOT would like to be 
considered for future opportunities of this type.
