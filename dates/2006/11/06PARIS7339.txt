SUBJECT: UNESCO - Literacy Prizes 
 
 
¶1. Summary.  On Friday, November 3, 2006, UNESCO awarded the 2006 
Literacy prizes to literacy programs in Pakistan, Turkey, Cuba, 
India, and Morocco. A program in China received an Honorable 
Mention.  Pakistan received the International Reading Association 
Literacy Prize.  IRA is a U.S. association and one of their members 
also sat on the jury panel that awarded these prizes.  Each prize is 
for $20,000 and is awarded annually in recognition of effective 
contributions to the fight against illiteracy.  ADG for Education, 
Peter Smith, presented the awards to each representative.  Yo si 
puedo, the Cuban literacy program, received the UNESCO King Sejong 
Literacy prize.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. The ceremony was non-controversial although well attended.  Each 
prize winner thanked UNESCO and said a few words about their 
program. While there was country press in attendance this was 
largely a non-event. ADG Smith spoke about the White House 
Conference on Global Literacy and its success and announced again 
that the first UNESCO follow-up regional literacy conference will be 
in Qatar next March. None of the programs who won these prizes were 
featured at the White House conference. 
 
¶3. The Mission's Education Attache, Sally Lovejoy, attended the 
event in recognition of our strong support for literacy.
