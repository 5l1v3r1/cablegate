SUBJECT: U.S. REPORT ON EFFORTS TOWARD IMPLEMENTATION OF 
UNSCR 1718 
 
REF: SECSTATE 188039 
 
 ¶1. (SBU) Summary: On November 21 New Zealand's Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) shared a draft copy of New 
Zealand's report to the UN Security Council detailing their 
implementation plan for UNSCR 1718 (repeated at para 2 
below). GNZ lawyers continue to work on sanction regulations 
and MFAT will provide post with a copy of the draft 
legislation once it has been approved by NZ Ministries. End 
summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Post delivered reftel demarche to Carolyn Schwalger, 
MFAT Senior Advisor for North Asia on November 17, 2006. MFAT 
on November 21 provided Post the following summary of New 
Zealand's proposed regulations per the provisions of 
paragraph 8 of UNSC 1718, as provided to the UNSCR: 
 
  Under para 8(a) - New Zealand's Regulation will prevent the 
direct or indirect supply, sale or transfer to the DPRK, 
through New Zealand's territory, or using New Zealand's flag 
vessels or aircraft (whether or not originating in their 
territories) of military equipment and items with a nuclear, 
ballistic or WMD end use and luxury goods. New Zealand will 
work with others to apply a consistent approach to the 
definition of "luxury goods."  All sanctioned military, WMD 
and ballistic missile related items are already listed on the 
New Zealand Strategic Goods Lists.  Items on this list 
require a permit for export, regardless of the destination. 
Application for export of all sanctioned military, WMD and 
ballistic missile related items to DPNK will be denied 
pending the implementation by regulation of provisions of 
paragraph 8(a)(i) and 8(a)(ii) of UNSCR 1718. Control over 
the import of sanctioned items from DPRK will be covered by 
the Regulations. 
 
  Under para 8(b) - The DPRK is prohibited from exporting 
goods in 8(a)(i) and (ii) and New Zealand's Regulation will 
prohibit New Zealanders from buying these goods from the DPRK 
or transporting such goods on their flagged vessels or 
aircraft. 
 
  Under para 8(c) - New Zealand's Regulations will ban the 
export of services (technical training, advice, services or 
assistance) related to these goods to the DPRK. For example, 
a New Zealander would be banned from providing technical 
training or emailing a manual related to military or WMD 
items. 
 
  Under para 8(d) - New Zealand's Regulation will freeze 
assets (funds, economic resources) on New Zealand's territory 
owned or controlled by persons/entities to be designated by 
the DPRK Sanctions Committee. It will also prevent New 
Zealanders from making funds, assets or resources available 
to these persons or entities. There are some exemptions to 
this sanction (including payments for legal fees and 
necessary expenses) and the Regulation will provide for these 
to be considered by New Zealand on a case by case basis and 
to be subject to the approval of the Sanctions Committee. 
 
  Under para 8(e) - New Zealand's Regulation will put in 
place a travel ban against persons from the DPRK ( and their 
family members) who will be designated by the DPRK Sanctions 
Committee. The Committee may make exceptions on humanitarian 
grounds. The New Zealand Department of Labor has already 
placed North Korea on the list of countries whose nationals' 
application to travel to New Zealand must be scrutinized by 
the New Zealand Immigration Profiling Group, to ensure that 
those nationals do not pose a risk to New Zealand's security 
or international reputation. 
 
¶3. (SBU) MFAT will provide Post with a copy of the draft 
legislation once it has been approved by NZ Ministries. MFAT 
Deputy Legal Advisor Caroline Bilkey has also thanked us for 
providing her with a copy of the U.S. luxury goods list, 
which she said will help guide NZ's own sanctions in that 
area.
