¶1. (SBU) As instructed reftels, we have sought Turkish 
support for the U.S. candidate with both the MFA Director 
General for Legal Affairs and with officials in the 
International Organizations Directorate responsible for the 
issue.  Both responded by seeking U.S. support for the 
Turkish candidate, Professor Raul Versan. As reported in ref 
c, the Turkish MFA has requested by diplomatic note that the 
U.S. and Turkey mutually agree to support each other's 
candidates. Post requests guidance on how we can respond to 
the Turkish request.
