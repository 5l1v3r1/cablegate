COMMITTEE MEETING, 14-15 DECEMBER IN ROME 
 
¶1.  The Ministry of Science and Technology has informed post that 
due to the lack of funds, GOB Science Advisor Newton Paciornik will 
only be able to represent Brazil at the Methane Markets Steering 
Committee Meeting on December 14-15 in Rome, if that organization 
finances his travel and lodging expenses.  Otherwise, Brazil will 
not be represented at the meeting.

response from event organizers regarding the possibility of funding 
for Mr. Paciornik.
