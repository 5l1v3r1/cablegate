¶1. (U) Twenty-five French Embassy and other official 
personnel left Kigali on 27 November at 19:00 local time via 
a Rwandair Express flight to Entebbe.  The atmosphere was 
somber in the airport VIP lounge, the French said final 
good-byes, took photos and shared chocolate.   There was no 
press and only a few mid-level Rwandan airport officials 
observed the last French diplomat boarding the DHC-8. 
 
¶2.  (U) Shortly after the French convoy left the French 
Embassy (16:30 local) for Kigali International Airport, a 
well organized group of approximately  250 young men arrived 
on the scene to demonstrate.  The Rwandans mobilized at the 
now closed French cultural center and marched less than a 
mile to the French Embassy.  (Note.  The French Embassy, in 
the upscale Kiovou neighborhood, shares a wall with the U.S. 
Marine residence.  End note.)  The demonstration, observed 
and recorded by RSO and a few Marines, started at 17:00 and 
lasted approximately 30 minutes.  Although some protesters 
made half hearted attempts to break through the cordon 
established by 25 Rwandan National Police (RNP) officers and 
climb the Embassy wall, there appeared to be little risk that 
the situation would escalate into a true riot.  After 20 
minutes of yelling and jumping about, a RNP riot control 
detachment of 20 officers swept through to disburse the 
crowd.  While the demonstrators were temporarily energized by 
the banging of batons on shields, they steadily withdrew- 
some laughing and smiling.  There were no reports of arrests 
or injuries, in fact, from video reviewed by Emboffs it did 
not appear that anyone was even hit by a baton rather; they 
were just brusquely nudged away. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Comment. The Rwandan decision was a shock to the 
French Embassy and most French officials, including the 
Ambassador, were deeply disappointed and blunt in their 
belief that the GOF would not return to Rwanda in the near 
future.  The demonstration, tailor-made for the press, was 
the only "popular" response on the 27th and country team does 
not consider it to be indicative of widespread anger by the 
Rwandan public that would lead to an increased risk to 
remaining French nationals or other foreigners. End comment.
