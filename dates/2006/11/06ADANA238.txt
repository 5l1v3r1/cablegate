some commanders went to the Yuksekova district in Hakkari and

stand with a condolence book for people to express their 
feelings upon former premier Bulent Ecevit's passing away. 
 
BOLGE:  Adana Mayor Aytac Durak extended condolences to 
Turkish people upon the passing of Bulent Ecevit.  Durak said 
that not every person holding authority has been able to remain 
honest like Bulent Ecevit in the course of his/her duties. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:   The daily points out that Bulent Ecevit had 
always taken a stance against the democratic rights of the 
Kurds, and he was never able to comprehend the reasons behind 
why the PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan was surrendered to Turkey on 
February 16, 1999, during his premiership. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:   DTP Chairperson Ahmet Turk harshly criticized 
PM Erdogan who said that the situation was being exaggerated, 
after the flooding incidents in the southeastern region.   Turk 
asked, "Are 40 people killed in the disaster not enough for PM 
Erdogan?" 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:   The daily continues to voice its allegations 
which were reported on October 19 about a mass grave found in 
Mardin's Nusaybin district.  The daily points out that the 
remains in the grave could belong to Armenians and Syriacs who 
were allegedly killed in 1915. 
 
 
BOLGE / ZAMAN:  French Ambassador to Ankara, Paul Poudade, 
paid a visit to the Mersin Governor and told the Governor that 
the current government [in Paris] was not backing the bill that 
made it a crime to deny the Armenian genocide and that the issue 
must be left to historians. 
 
SECURITY 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM / EVRENSEL:        Turkish Armed Forces launched a 
large scale operation against the PKK in Siirt's Kurtalan and 
Eruh districts.  Meanwhile, Mahmut Alinak, DTP provincial 
chairperson in Kars, said that they would undertake actions to 
stop the operations unless the military operations going on in 
the southeastern region despite the cease-fire were stopped. 
Alinak said that their patience was running out. 
 
ECONOMY 
 
SABAH (GUNEY) / BOLGE / ZAMAN:  A business delegation from

BOLGE:  Last week's rains lowered the quality of cotton 
cultivated in the fields of the Cukurova region by 35 per cent.

from the recent situation.

recently hit Hakkari's Semdinli district.  Three people 
disappeared and four people were wounded there.  150 houses have 
been evacuated.  The daily points out that, like in the recent 
flooding in Batman, the Governor's Office of Hakkari reportedly 
rejected the Semdinli Municipality's request for a helicopter to 
access the quarters which the flooding hit because of the bad 
weather conditions.  Semdinli Mayor Hursit Tekin made a call for 
urgent aid to be sent to the province and said that water 
network, electricity and telephone lines were down in the 
district.  65 civil society organizations, and municipalities in 
the region, which the daily reports the latter as from DTP, have 
been sending aid to the area and making calls for the government 
to declare the region as a disaster zone.  The organizations, 
which expressed that PM Erdogan was informed insufficiently 
about the disaster in the region, made a call to the prime 
minister [asking him] to visit the region.

three people disappeared in yesterday's flooding in Hakkari's 
Semdinli district.

week ago damaged 10,000 houses and affected 62,841 people,

blankets, 400 beds, and 218 heaters to the people.  DTP's Batman

the quarters badly hit by the flooding.   The flooding affected

washed and covered by the flood waters.  The municipality 
workers and people struggled to discharge the flood waters from 
the houses.
