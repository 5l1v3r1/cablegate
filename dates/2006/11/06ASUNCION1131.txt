PolCouns stressed with Terami Matsuo, the MFA's Director of 
International Organizations, U.S. concern about the 
anti-Israel bias in the UN and our request Paraguay join 
other States in either rejecting the extension of the 
mandates of the three entities identified in reftel.  Matsuo, 
having recently returned from five years with Paraguay's 
mission to the UN, was well familiar with the plethora of 
resolutions relating to the Middle East.  She said that she 
would consult with her superiors and representatives in New 
York about Paraguay's position on this issue.
