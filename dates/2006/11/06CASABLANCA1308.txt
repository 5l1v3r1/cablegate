¶2. (SBU) Per reftel, Econoff delivered talking points regarding the 
International Maritime Organization's 
(IMO) role in two maritime safety and security programs to Mohamed 
Marzagui, Chief of the Division of Maritime Navigation; Omar Hassein, 
Chief of Security for Maritime Navigation; and Abderrazzak Atide, 
Chief of the Maritime Quarter of Casablanca.  Mr. Hussein wanted more 
detailed information about precisely how the Long Range 
Identification and Tracking (LRIT) system would work.  He said that, 
while the minimum requirements were outlined in the U.S. proposal, 
how the system would operate in practice was still unclear.  Per the 
background information provided, Econoff noted that the 
implementation details of the LRIT program still need to be 
addressed. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Mr. Marzagui said that he would take note of the U.S. 
position on the two maritime programs to be discussed at the upcoming 
Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) meeting.  Regardless of whether the 
IMO or the International Mobile Satellite Organization (IMSO) 
coordinates the LRIT program, he and his colleagues would like more 
information on how it would work.  They plan to talk to U.S. 
representatives at the MSC meeting in Istanbul for clarification.
