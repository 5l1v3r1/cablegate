-- Salafi Islamist and former MP Dr. Walid Al-Tabtabaei stated in 
moderate Arabic daily Al-Watan "Zarqawi has been murdered and many 
Zarqawis remain" (6/9): "If the Zarqawi being pursued and hunted by 
the Coalition Forces and Iraqi Government has been killed, there are 
many other Zarqawis who practice sectarian killings on a wide scale, 
but they are not hunted or wanted.  They work under the umbrella of 
official Iraqi authority, wearing its military uniforms, and go 
through American and British checkpoints without being stopped.  Not 
only that--some of those Zarqawis have worked as ministers in the 
Iraqi government."

-- Writer and researcher Bandar Ayed Al-Zafiri questioned in the 
pro-government Arabic daily Al-Seyassah under the title "Zarqawi's 
Death Points to a New Era" (6/10): "Many events accompanied 
Zarqawi's death that point to the fact that he may not have been 
killed on the day that it was announced.  First, there was the 
Jordanian king's visit to Saudi two days ago.  Second, there was the 
secret visit by the Qatari Amir to Syria, following the announcement

of the arrest of a group of Syrians accused of sabotage. Third, we 
have the conclusion of Brammertz's report that will be announced 
soon.  Fourth, there seems to be a positive understanding between 
Iran and America. Fifth, there is pan-Gulf insistence on solving the 
Iranian issue diplomatically.  Sixth, there is the naming of Iraq's 
Minister of Interior and Minister of Defense.  And, seventh, we have 
talk of intelligence cooperation with the Jordanians. All these 
events occurred before or at the same time as Zarqawi's death, is 
there a thin line tying them together?" 
 
-- Former Media Advisor to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sami Abdul 
Latif Al-Nesf inquires in the moderate Arabic daily Al-Anbaa under 
the title "Deciphering Zarqawi's Code" (6/10): "Ahmed Fudail Nazal 
Al-Khlailah (Zarqawi) can be named the king of disguise and mystery. 
 The photograph of him dead posed many questions that attempt to 
decipher the code of his life and his repeated disappearances as did 
the image of Mary Magdalene in Da Vinci's painting.  He went to 
Afghanistan in 1989 to fight the Russians; he did not know that they 
were gone.  He disappeared there for four years.  Then, in 1993, he 
left when civil war broke out among the Mujahidin.  He entered Iraq 
in 2003 and disappeared.  He began his work in Iraq through 
cooperation with Saddam's Baathist intelligence services to destroy 
the country and ignite civil war.  He brazenly claimed 
responsibility for the assassination of Mohamed Baqir Al-Hakim and 
followed that with hundreds of explosions in public places....  The 
members of the family with which Noury Al-Saeed took refuge reported 
him to authorities within minutes for a 10,000 Iraqi dinar reward. 
No one successfully reported Zarqawi's whereabouts despite a reward 
equivalent to 375 billion Iraqi dinars." 
 
-- Dr. Ayed Al-Manaa stated in moderate Arabic daily Al-Watan under 
the title "He who kills shall be killed" (6/10): "A criminal is one 
who transgresses on the lives, honor, dignity, and humanity of 
others unjustly....  [As opposed to a martyr,] Zarqawi is that type 
of person--those to whom human life meant nothing.  Their 
interpretations do not matter as no one, including himself, denies 
the crimes he has committed against hundreds of innocent people.... 
Zarqawi's demise will not end terrorist activities, however, without 
a doubt, it has damaged their morale."
