¶1.  (SBU) Poloff delivered demarches (reftel A and B) on June 
16 and June 19, 2006, respectively, to Mr. Dusit Manapan, 
Director of the Social Division of the Bureau of 
International Organization at the Thai Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs.  Dusit was non-committal on whether Thailand will 
vote against an early adjournment of the Conference. 
However, he did state that Thailand will vote to amend the 
statutes in line with their Third Additional Protocol vote if 
it is brought up at the meeting. 
 
¶2.  (U) Dusit then updated Poloff on the current status of 
Thailand's ability to sign for the Third Additional Protocol 
(reftel C).  He explained that the law which needs to be 
passed before Thailand can legally sign for the MDA is still 
being held under hiatus due to the current political 
uncertainty in Thailand.  He indicated that this was unlikely 
to change until a new government has been formed.
