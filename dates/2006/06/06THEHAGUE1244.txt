(SBU) MFA Senior Advisor for Asia Bernard Kelkes said the 
GONL remains interested in contributing to the Law and Order 
Trust Fund for Afghanistan (LOTRA).  However, the GONL does 
not/not envisage making a contribution in the near future, he 
said.  The Dutch 1400-troop deployment to Uruzgan is proving 
much more expensive than anticipated; this has restricted 
their ability to contribute to the fund, he explained. 
Kelkes was unable to predict when the GONL might be ready to 
address an additional contribution; much depends on the 
deployment to Uruzgan.  Polmiloff discussed reftel with 
Kelkes on June 1.
