HELMS-BURTON RESOLUTION AND THE SANTO DOMINGO DECLARATION

REF: STATE 87933

Classified By: Ambassador Brenda L. Johnson; reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)

¶1. (SBU) On June 1, Econoff delivered reftel talking points to XXXXXXXXXXXX, Director, Caribbean and Americas Department at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade (MFAFT). On the issue of the "trade and investment" resolution, XXXXXXXXXXXX stated that she would take our concerns to the delegation, which would be led by MFAFT Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade (Deputy Foreign Minister) Delano Franklyn. She noted that the GOJ had not yet come to any specific decisions, as they will spend the days before the General Assembly "in consultation with our CARICOM partners." Likewise, with regard to Venezuela's proposed additional language for the Declaration of Santo Domingo, the GOJ could not offer a firm commitment, but said that the delegation will note USG concerns.

¶2. (SBU) XXXXXXXXXXXX indicated that her office would be unable to provide a specific answer to Econoff in advance of the GOJ delegation's departure for Santo Domingo on Saturday, June 3. Post therefore recommends that the U.S. delegation make contact in Santo Domingo with the Jamaican delegation to reiterate USG views and to seek further information.

¶3. (C) Comment: XXXXXXXXXXXX was receptive to our talking points, but her reluctance to make any comment may also reflect something more. In a private meeting with the Ambassador on May 30 (septel), Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller (protect) conveyed her fear that Venezuela was witholding much-needed funds that had been promised for a variety of projects. Simpson Miller suspected that the GOV is waiting to see whether or not the GOJ supports Venezuela's bid for one of the non-permanent seats on the UN Security Council this fall. This concern may well engender a reticence from GOJ representatives to publicly support measures or positions that would offend the GOV. End comment.
