SUBJECT:  POULTRY BAN IN WAKE OF SHENZHEN AI CASE 
CONFIRMATION 
 
REF: Hong Kong 2469 
 
¶1. On June 15, the PRC Ministry of Health notified Hong 
Kong's Centre for Health Protection (CHP) that it had 
confirmed a human case of avian influenza (AI) in Shenzhen. 
Reftel reported the details of this case, which involved a 
truck driver hospitalized on June 3. 
 
¶2. Secretary for Health, Welfare, and Food, Dr. York Chow 
said that in view of the human case, Hong Kong would suspend 
the import of live poultry and birds from the mainland 
beginning June 16.  Chilled and frozen poultry imports from 
the mainland will not be affected.  The ban will be lifted 
after three weeks so long as no further outbreaks of AI 
occur in humans or in chicken farms in Guangdong Province 
and Shenzhen. 
 
¶3. Chow said that mainland authorities had made a 
preliminary assessment that before the Shenzhen patient 
showed flu symptoms, he had paid a number of visits to a wet 
market that sells live chickens.  It was this direct 
connection to live poultry that gave rise to the import ban, 
he explained. 
 
¶4. Hong Kong is also responding to the Shenzhen case with a 
series of surveillance and public education measures.  This 
includes enhanced reporting of symptoms by public hospitals, 
stepped-up inspection of poultry imports and local poultry 
farms, greater vigilance by Customs with regard to illegal 
imports of poultry into Hong Kong, and more public interest 
announcements about preventing the spread of AI.
