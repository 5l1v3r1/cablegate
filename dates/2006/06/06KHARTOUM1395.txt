Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  On May 29, 2006, the U.N. Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO) convened the third Technical Task 
Force meeting on avian influenza (AI) in Khartoum, but 
with poor attendance by key members.  More than one week 
had passed with no new cases of AI reported in Sudan. 
Khartoum State has taken measures to prevent the spread 
of AI to disease-free localities and has begun health 
surveillance of poultry farm workers.  Since April 9, 
2006, poultry farms of varying sizes have been affected 
and 800,000 chickens have been culled in Khartoum State. 
Khartoum-based offices of FAO, the U.N. Children's Fund 
(UNICEF), and the U.N. World Health Organization (WHO) 
are preparing to present a joint proposal on actions 
needed to mitigate and contain the AI outbreak in Sudan 
to the international donor community in the coming week. 
End summary.

AI Task Force Coordination 
-------------------------- 
 
¶2.  On May 29, FAO/Khartoum convened a meeting of the 
Technical Task Force on AI.  This task force is composed 
of 11 member organizations representing various U.N. 
agencies, Sudanese government ministries, Sudan's poultry 
industry, and the international donor community.  At the 
previous meeting of the task force, per reftel, FAO had 
agreed to contact task force members, particularly 
representatives of the Ministry of Health (MOH), Ministry 
of Finance (MOF), and UNICEF, to ensure full 
participation in future meetings.  The subsequent absence 
of these organizations at the May 29 session had a 
negative impact on the outcome of the meeting, as 
information that could have been shared was not 
available.  Members again urged FAO to contact these 
organizations. 
 
¶3.  The Task Force has formed a committee to address 
issues related to the economic impact of AI on the 
poultry industry in Sudan, such as compensation for 
farmers.  Task Force members present at the May 29 
meeting discussed banning the importation of poultry 
products and encouraging in-country breeding as ways to 
mitigate the economic effects of AI. 
 
¶4.  The Task Force is also forming an operational unit 
that will co-locate with the Ministry of Animal Resources 
and Fisheries (MoAR) with support from FAO.  The unit 
will include veterinarians and a physician and will work 
with guidance from a USAID/USDA consultant seconded to 
FAO.  This unit will continue work to establish an 
effective national AI surveillance system in Sudan. 
 
¶5.  On June 12, a regional workshop on AI control and 
prevention will take place in Nairobi.  One candidate 
from Sudan, representing the North, is confirmed to 
participate.  A request has been made for a second seat 
to allow a candidate from the South to attend the 
workshop.  Task Force members agreed that additional 
training for laboratory specialists should be provided in 
Sudan so that more candidates can participate in 
veterinary research.

Outbreak Update - Khartoum State 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  At the invitation of the Task Force, a Khartoum State 
Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources (KSMoAr) 
representative attended the May 29 meeting.  Khartoum 
State began AI surveillance in October 2005.  When some 
farms reported high mortality rates, Khartoum State 
initiated active control measures, including culling, 
disinfection, and destruction of poultry products and 
feeds before testing results were reported.  Since April 
9, when the first report of AI occurred, 200 poultry 
 
KHARTOUM 00001395  002 OF 002 
 
 
farms of varying sizes have been affected and 800,000 
chickens culled in Khartoum State.  More than one week 
has passed with no new cases of AI reported. 
 
¶7.  In collaboration with the MoAR and the Federal 
Veterinary Laboratory, the KSMoAR is planning a poultry 
vaccination program.  The initial phase of the 
vaccination campaign will target 800,000 chickens, and 
the entire campaign will ultimately vaccinate 3 million 
chickens.  Before and after the vaccinations, the KSMoAR 
will test and monitor antibody levels.  (Note:  The time 
frame for the program has not yet been specified, and a 
committee has been formed to study and recommend an 
implementation plan.  In general, vaccination is not 
recommended until three months after the last outbreak. 
End note.)

Contributions 
------------- 
 
¶8.  The revised FAO, UNICEF, and WHO proposal on actions 
needed to mitigate and contain AI will likely be 
presented to donors during the week of June 11.  To date, 
FAO has provided 600 kilograms of disinfectant and is 
planning to provide 40 specimen transport kits.  The 
Government of National Unity (GNU) has provided 100 
million Sudanese Dinars (SD) or approximately USD 455,000 
to the MoAR for AI control activities, with 20 million SD 
(USD 90,000) provided to Khartoum State and 15 million SD 
(USD 68,000) to Gezira State. 
 
¶9.  USAID is providing USD 200,000 to FAO for 
coordination, training, and the purchase of personal 
protective equipment (PPE).  Two thousand units of USAID- 
donated PPE are currently en route to Sudan for 
consignment to FAO.
