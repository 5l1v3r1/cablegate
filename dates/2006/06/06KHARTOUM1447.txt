Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  On June 16, 2006, USAID Office of U.S. Foreign 
Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA) Disaster Operations 
Specialist Jennifer Mayer spoke at a U.N. Children's Fund 
(UNICEF) event in Bentiu, Unity State, celebrating the 
measles vaccination of the one millionth child in 
Southern Sudan.  The Mass Measles Campaign has enormously 
improved immunization coverage in Southern Sudan by 
involving the Ministry of Health, UNICEF, the U.N. World 
Health Organization (WHO), and dozens of local and 
international non-governmental organizations (NGOs). 
USAID/OFDA has contributed more than USD 1 million to 
UNICEF's Mass Measles Campaign since 2004.  End summary.

¶2.  On June 16, 2006, USAID/OFDA Disaster Operations 
Specialist Jennifer Mayer attended and presented remarks 
on behalf of USAID at a UNICEF event held in Bentiu, 
Unity State, to celebrate the measles vaccination of the 
one millionth child in Southern Sudan.  The day included 
presentations by USAID, the Unity State Ministry of 
Health, representatives of the Southern Sudan Relief and 
Rehabilitation Commission, the Director of UNICEF 
Southern Sudan, the Director of WHO Southern Sudan, 
representatives from the office of the Governor of Unity 
State, and the Ministry of Health for Southern Sudan. 
 
¶3.  Remarks made during the event stressed the need for 
continued support to the health sector in Southern Sudan 
and pointed to wider access to health services for all 
communities as an essential element to sustaining peace 
in the south.  Access to health services is one of the 
most tangible and important dividends of the peace 
agreement in Southern Sudan and will be necessary for the 
return and resettlement of populations displaced by the 
war. 
 
¶4.  Both spontaneous and state-sponsored returns have 
continued in Unity State in the first half of 2006, with 
more than 5,500 returnees reported to have arrived in 
April alone.  Returnees are concentrated primarily in and 
around the towns of Bentiu/Rubkona, Paryang, Abiemnom, 
Guit, and Leer, making the provision of basic services 
critical.  In general, returnees are reintegrating 
peacefully, although problems have been reported over 
availability of water and lack of relief items such as 
plastic sheeting for shelter.  (Note:  Local building 
materials are scarce since the start of the rainy season 
in May.  End note.)  USAID/OFDA is funding seven NGO 
partners in Unity State in FY 2006, providing relief 
commodities to returnee households; food security, 
agriculture and fisheries activities; clean water; 
support to veterinary programs; and primary health care. 
USAID/OFDA partner PACT is working with UNICEF and others 
to install 70 new boreholes in Unity State in 2006. 
 
¶5.  USAID/OFDA has contributed USD 1,050,000 to UNICEF's 
Mass Measles Campaign throughout Southern Sudan since 
¶2004.  Currently, outbreaks of measles in the south occur 
most commonly in children ages 10 to 15 years.  Measles 
immunization coverage in the country is estimated at only 
18 percent.  The Mass Measles Campaign for Southern Sudan 
has put forth an enormous effort to improve this 
coverage, involving the Ministry of Health, UNICEF, WHO, 
and dozens of local and international NGO partners.  Lack 
of trained health workers and infrastructure in Southern 
Sudan, including transportation, vaccine storage 
capacity, and health facilities, have presented a 
significant challenge in attaining the one millionth 
child milestone.  Additional complications stem from 
difficulties in reaching underserved, rural populations 
and managing access to shifting populations as returns 
continue throughout the south. 
 
¶6.  USAID, through humanitarian and bilateral funding has 
 
KHARTOUM 00001447  002 OF 002 
 
 
provided major support to health care in Southern Sudan. 
USAID/OFDA has provided more than USD 23 million per year 
over the past two years to NGO and UN partners to support 
primary health care activities, including health 
facilities, health care workers, training, essential 
drugs and medical supplies.  In mid-2004, USAID was the 
first donor to begin developmental health activities in 
Southern Sudan with the Sudan Health Transformation 
Project.  In addition, the U.S. Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention has been active in disease 
surveillance and is strengthening the capacity of the 
nascent Ministry of Health with epidemiological training. 
The U.S. Government remains a committed partner with the 
Ministry of Health to improve health care in all of 
Southern Sudan.
