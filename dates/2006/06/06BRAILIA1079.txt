including municipalities, indutrial plants and hospitals.  The 
legislation forally took effect with the governor's signature. 
owever, the Sao Paulo state Environmental Secretarat still must 
draft rules governing the measure's implementation.  Sao Paulo's new 
law covers the andling and disposal of all types of solid waste, 
from organic and inorganic residential trash and ospital waste to 
recyclable products and hazardos industrial refuse.  The 
legislation was considered necessary because Brazil has no national 
soli-waste-management law-a situation that has prompte other 
states to pass their own measures, says So Paulo state Assemblyman 
Rodolfo Costa e Silva,who oversaw passage of the bill.

¶21. Brazil: Environmentalists Challeng Garbage Burning 
 
MAY 13, 2006 - The "Usina Verd" project seeks to generate energy in 
Brazil whie eliminating urban waste and helping to reduce global 
warming. But its good intentions have not wonover environmental 
groups because the plan involes burning the garbage.  The pilot 
plant of the roject, which involves capital from a private compny 
of the same name, began operations in May 2005in Rio de Janeiro and 
is already converting 30 tns of garbage a day into 2.6 megawatts of 
energy  The sponsors of Usina Verde hope to sell facilities like 
the Rio de Janeiro plant to municipalities throughout the country. 
The project, one of 72 already approved by the Brazilian 
Inter-Ministerial Committee on Global Climate Change, now has to go 
through the United Nations before it can become part of the carbon 
market system.

¶22. Argentina: Transforming Garbage into Decent Jobs 
 
MAY 16, 2006 - A new law on Integral Management of Solid Urban Waste 
went into effect in late 2005.  The law stipulates that the amount 
of garbage in landfills is to be reduced by 50 percent by 2012 and 
75 percent by 2017, from 2003 levels.  To reach that goal, the 
Buenos Aires city government has sponsored the organization of 
cooperatives of garbage scavengers and provided space for the first 
warehouse, located on the west side of the city and inaugurated on 
May 1, International Labor Day.  It has also launched a pilot 
garbage separation program in buildings more than 20 stories high, 
public offices, five-star hotels, and housing, businesses and 
offices in the exclusive Buenos Aires district of Puerto Madero, on 
the Rio de la Plata coast.
