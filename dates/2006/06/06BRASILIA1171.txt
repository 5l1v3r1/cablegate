¶1. (SBU) The Mission has received repeated assurances, most 
prominently during Secretary of Commerce Gutierrez's June 7 
meeting with President Lula's Chief of Staff Dilma Rousseff -- 
who also serves as President of Petrobras' Board of Directors -- 
that Petrobras has no interest in taking over Occidental 
Petroleum's Ecuador assets (ref A).  The Charge received similar 
assurances from Petrobras International Director Nestor Cervero 
in a May 26 meeting (ref C).  Given these credible assurances, 
made at the ministerial level, Post believes the Occidental case 
should not be an obstacle to Petrobras' proposed acquisition of 
50% of Pasadena Refining Systems (PRS). 
 
¶2. (SBU) Although Petrobras is majority owned by the GoB, the 
company is publicly traded on both the New York Stock Exchange 
(NYSE) and the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange (BOVESPA).  Since it's 
partial privatization of the 1990's, the company has been run 
much more like a private company than an arm of the Brazilian 
government.  It has a reputation for sound corporate governance 
and for innovation in deepwater drilling technologies. 
Moreover, as it has expanded overseas, it has behaved in the 
interests of its stockholders, even in cases where these did not 
fully coincide with the policy of the Brazilian government. 
Post does not believe that Petrobras' acquisition of PRS poses a 
national security risk.
