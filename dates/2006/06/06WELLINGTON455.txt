¶1. (C) On June 13, Poloff delivered reftel points to Valerie 
Meyer, Deputy Director of United Nations, Human Rights & 
Commonwealth Division, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade 
(MFAT).  On June 14, Meyer responded that GNZ agrees with the 
U.S. position in general, particulary that the agenda should 
focus on establishing effective processes and mechanisms and 
avoid setting a negative tone that could become an entrenched 
element of the Human Rights Council.  GNZ does not intend to 
sponsor any country specific or thematic resolutions.  They 
believe that country resolutions, if introduced, may in some 
cases be helpful.  Meyer said this seems similar to the USG 
view that country situations should be included as part of 
the agenda if they regard technical assistance and emergency 
concerns.  However, GNZ does have some concern that "talking 
about country specific resolutions at all could resurrect all 
the old debate," added Meyer. 
 
¶2. (C) GNZ "strongly views that the Sub-Commission should be 
disestablished," said Meyer.  She noted keen interest in the 
fact that the Sub-Commission's budget had been four times 
larger than the Human Rights Commission itself, saying that 
GNZ is interested in seeing the funding fully returned to the 
Office of the High Commission. 
 
¶3. (C) Meyer had little to stay on the Declaration of Rights 
of Indigenous Peoples, except to note that she understands 
that U.S. and New Zealand missions in Geneva are in close 
contact on this issue.
