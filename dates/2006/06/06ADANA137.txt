recent news articles of the mainstream newspapers (see press

in the Incirlik Airbase in Adana, and discontent of the people 
living in the Incirlik district on hearing such news.  Zaman

Aksu and his daughter in Mardin's Kiziltepe district on June 3 
(see press summaries 06/05, 06 and 07), officials from Mardin 
chapter of Human Rights Association (HRA) said that it was too 
early to make comments on the incident, but there was not much 
similarity between the killing of Ahmet and his son Ugur Kaymaz 
in November 2004 in Kiziltepe and that incident.  DTP and HRA 
sent delegations to Kiziltepe.

authorities were demanding the translation fee from the inmates.
