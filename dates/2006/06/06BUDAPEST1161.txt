(U) On June 1, the MFA released the following statement of 
Hungary's position on the U.S. initiative for talks with 
Iran,  Embassy translation of the original Hungarian follows: 
 
(begin text:) 
 
The Hungarian government welcomes the statement yesterday of 
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on Iran's nuclear 
program and talks to be conducted in relation to this matter. 
 
According to the Hungarian position the proposals of the 
statement would move the debate over Iran's nuclear program 
out of the deadlock and facilitate direct participation by 
the United States in working out a long-term solution. Iran 
should carry out a complete and verifiable suspension of its 
uranium enrichment program. 
 
The Hungarian government agrees with European Union's chief 
Commissioner Javier Solana that strengthening the United 
States' readiness for immediate talks is a strong and 
positive sign that the international community would like to 
achieve an agreement with Iran.
