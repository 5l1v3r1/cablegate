SUBJECT: KUNAR TRIP HIGHLIGHTS NEED FOR MORE AFGHAN INPUT 
INTO ASSISTANCE PROJECTS 
 
¶1. SUMMARY: Increasing Afghans, involvement in 
development projects was one of the main themes of the 
Ambassador,s June 4 trip to the PRT in Asadabad, Kunar 
province. The Ambassador met with Governor Wafa, 
members of the local shura, and students from a nearby 
school who were an enthusiastic audience for his 
remarks. He also visited the site of a tragic rocket 
attack on an open air school. There are significant 
needs in this province, as is true throughout 
Afghanistan, but there is a clear USG plan to start to 
meet them. END SUMMARY. 
 
DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS 
 
¶2. The ambassador repeatedly asked local leaders how more 
local participation in development projects could be 
encouraged. Most responded initially with uncertainty, 
but when pressed usually agreed that they could find 
laborers to assist in projects. Constructing stretches 
of stone road was repeatedly suggested as a potential 
pilot project, especially as a means to connect small 
valleys to the roads that run through major valleys 
and to district centers. Similar roads have been 
constructed elsewhere in Afghanistan and the 
prevalence of requisite stones and skilled locals 
makes it an appealing project. The PRT Commander and 
USAID representatives agreed to explore the 
feasibility of such construction.  Aside from roads 
and protective walls, aquaculture and apiculture were 
also suggested by the Afghans. 
 
TAX COLLECTION 
 
¶3. Tax collection appears to be a confusing topic, as 
elsewhere in Afghanistan. Governor Wafa said that 
while most of the revenue had to be sent back to 
Kabul, municipal tax revenue can be kept within the 
province. Wafa pointed out that the lack of shops and 
markets results in very little revenue. He is hopeful 
that, with greater development, this may improve. 
 
ILLEGAL LOGGING 
 
¶4. Illegal logging continues to be a problem in Nuristan 
and Kunar provinces. The Governor mentioned a plan by 
the central government to auction off seized timber. 
The visibility of the timber, to would-be poachers, 
presently serves as a reminder of the ban. Without 
this reminder and with the government able to raise 
revenue from the seizure of illegal timber there are 
concerns that the logging may continue. 
 
Q & A WITH STUDENTS 
 
¶5. Visits to two schools made it clear that education is 
a priority for this region, although there is still a 
clear need for teachers and facilities. The Ambassador 
stressed that these requests are not unique to Kunar 
and that Afghans need to start to move away from 
compiling &laundry lists8 and towards identifying 
priorities and areas for collaboration. (Note: 
Unfortunately, his words appeared to fall on deaf 
ears, as the locals continued to present the 
Ambassador with lists of projects throughout the day. 
End Note.) One interesting outcome of a discussion 
with school-aged boys was that most are considering 
jobs in the ANA or ANP. 
 
¶6. In his remarks to the group, the Ambassador compared 
today,s Afghanistan to the country he visited 
extensively in the 1960,s. Most of what existed had 
been broken but there was little infrastructure then. 
Afghans now are more aware of what they do not have 
and it will take a long time to meet their new needs

and expectations. The US has built 400 schools, 
including ten in Kunar, and has trained 60,000 
teachers, but we recognize that more are needed. In 
closing the Ambassador stressed that the US was not 
here to rule Afghanistan but truly wants the Afghan 
people to take the lead in managing their country. The 
US will ask Pakistan to do more to fight the Taliban 
and terrorism, a comment that was received 
enthusiastically. He stressed that both states should 
have a common interest in fighting extremism.
