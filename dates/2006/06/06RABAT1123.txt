¶1.  This cable is sensitive but unclassified.  Please treat 
accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  The American Bar Association (ABA, reftel A) is a 
strong partner of the USG as it implements programs relating 
to the rule of law in Morocco.  Funded by both DRL and MEPI, 
the ABA is effectively and inventively assisting in 
implementing important aspects of the Mission's reform 
strategy.  The Human Rights Clinical Legal Education program 
at the Law Faculty of Hassan II University in Mohammedia, 
funded by DRL, is an excellent example of transformational 
diplomacy in action.  The Mission works closely with the ABA, 
enabling mission officers to enhance their understanding of 
rule of law issues (Reftel C), and increase their knowledge 
of legal educational issues in Morocco (Reftels B and D). 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Because of the success of the legal education 
program, the Moroccan Association for Human Rights (AMDH), 
one of Morocco's most prominent and largest human rights 
organizations, approached the ABA to sign a "memorandum of 
understanding" (MOU).  This is unusual in that AMDH, unlike 
most other Moroccan human rights organizations, has boycotted 
embassy programs, activities, and contacts since the start of 
the Iraq war.  Knowing that the ABA is funded by the USG did 
not stop AMDH from recognizing the importance of the legal 
education clinic.  The MOU between ABA and  AMDH is an 
important step in enhancing the Mission's partnerships with 
Moroccan stakeholders. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  The MOU was signed by the ABA regional manager and 
the president of AMDH, Abdelhamid Amine, and is effective 
from June 1, 2006 through May 31, 2007.  The purpose of the 
MOU, as stated in the agreement, is: 
 
"In pursuing their common objectives of promoting human 
rights and strengthening the rule of law, the ABA and the 
AMDH enter into this partnershp agreement in order to 
cooperate in the implementation of their respective programs. 
 This agreement aims also at developing synergies among the 
many civil society members who are partners of the ABA (NGOs, 
universities, bar associations) and the AMDH." 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  The MOU also identifies in which areas the ABA and 
AMDH will cooperate; a detailed document will be developed 
relating to the legal education program.  They will: 
 
--organize roundtables and workshops on approaches to human 
rights issues; 
--the ABA will provide technical and material assistance, 
e.g., the facilities, for human rights training activities; 
--share information on the development of respective 
activities. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Comment:  The mission is pleased with this 
development and hopes the ABA-AMDH partnership works to make 
a difference in the lives of young Moroccan law students and 
contributes further to our broader judicial reform goals. 
The DCM will visit the law clinic in Mohammedia on June 14 
and award certificates to the law students who have completed 
the one-year clinical program.
