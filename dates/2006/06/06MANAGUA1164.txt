REF: STATE 85618 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul Trivelli for reason 1.4 (b) 
 
(C) Polcouns and Poloff discussed with Nicaraguan Vice 
Minister of Government Deyanira Arguello on May 31 the points 
in reftel and gave her a copy of the embargoed report. 
Arguello took the opportunity to mention a recent government 
initiative to counter trafficking in persons -- for the next 
three months, Ministry staff, several Nicaraguan National 
Police and a government cameraman will periodically "check" 
on area nightclubs.  The team showed up unannounced at three 
nightclubs over the May 27 weekend and found a number of 
underage prostitutes and a six-year old boy being held in one 
of the nightclubs.  The police subsequently shut down the 
nightclub.  The cameraman will videotape and document each 
"check" and the tapes will be used to build cases against the 
nightclubs and their owners.
