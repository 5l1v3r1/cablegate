SUBJECT: CHANGE TO SEISMIC RESEARCH STATION AGREEMENT 
 
REF: STATE 103029 
 
(SBU) On June 23, we proposed to MFA North America Department 
Head Vakur Erkul the change to the Feb. 8, 2000 agreement 
concerning the seismic research station to permit the 
installation, operation and maintenance of new sensors in 
eastern Turkey (reftel).  Erkul was unfamiliar with the 
issue, asked for the proposal in the form of a diplomatic 
note (which we provided), and undertook to consult with the 
relevant authorities.  He anticipated it would take several 
weeks before he had an indication of the GOT's receptivity to 
this proposal.
