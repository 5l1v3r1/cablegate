-- Amar Taqi commented in moderate Arabic daily Al-Rai Al-Aam under 
the title "Al-Zarqawi and the Conspiracy Theory" (6/16): "Those who 
cried over Zarqawi are the very same people who cried over the 
former Iraqi dictator and were sympathetic.  It is the same case for 
the pan-Arab satellite channels that set aside all the crimes and 
massacres Zarqawi committed against civilians and turned their 
attention to, according to conspiracy theories, looking into the 
'truth' behind the timing of Zarqawi's killing and the completion of 
the formation of the Iraqi government and the American-Iranian ease. 
 Iraq won its first round against terrorism.  There is no doubt that 
Zarqawi's death is a step for Iraqis in the direction of 
guaranteeing their country's future and its unity.  Therefore, the 
Iraqi government must take advantage before the opportunity passes 
and work to unite Iraqis and dismantle the infrastructure of the 
terrorist cells, Baathists, and Zarqawists, who even after the 
demise of 'their leader who taught them sorcery' (a verse from the 
Quran) carry out their destruction in Iraq." 
 
-- Ahmed Bu Dostoor stated in moderate Arabic daily Al-Watan under 
the title "Mecca's People Know Its Streets" (6/15): "Iraq is 
witnessing a new era following the absence of the head of terrorism, 
the butcher Al-Zarqawi, who inflicted all kinds of torture upon 
Iraqis and spread destruction and mayhem in Iraqi cities.  However, 
God watches over his subjects and for all things, there is an 
end....  We say to the terrorists who follow Zarqawi and other 
Takfiris, your end is near and your vanishing close so lift your 
hands from Iraq and its people."
