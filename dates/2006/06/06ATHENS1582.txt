SUBJECT: GREEK JUSTICE MINISTER REQUESTS TRANSFER OF 
"SUPERVISED RELEASE" FOR CONVICTED SPY LALAS 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Charles P. Ries for reasons 1.4 b and d. 
 
¶1.  (U) On June 19, Ambassador received a letter from Greek 
Justice Minister Anastasis Papaligouras with a copy of a 
letter to Attorney General Gonzalez (see para 5) requesting 
that former Embassy Athens communicator and convicted spy 
Steven Lalas be allowed to serve the remainder of his 
"supervised release" in Greece.  The Minister asks this 
request be granted on humanitarian grounds, as Lalas' wife 
and children are now permanent residents in Greece.  By way 
of assurance, the Minister notes that "Greek judicial 
authorities shall undertake to honor all standard conditions 
of supervision imposed on Lalas."  Local media reported on 
June 17 that the original letter to the U.S. Attorney General 
was transmitted by the Greek Ministry of Justice on June 16. 
 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 

¶2.  (C) Lalas pleaded guilty in 1993 in the Eastern District 
of Virginia of conspiracy to commit espionage for passing 
classified information to Greek intelligence circles while he 
worked at Embassy Athens.  In the two years before his 
arrest, he passed at least 240 "Confidential" and "Secret" 
level documents to a Greek military official in exchange for 
money, including highly sensitive messages revealing covert 
identities and job descriptions of U.S. Central Intelligence 
Agency personnel.  He was sentenced to 168 months (14 years) 
imprisonment and a five year term of supervised release. 
Lalas served his prison sentence in the U.S. and was released 
to the supervision of the United States Parole and Probation 
Service in New Hampshire on July 8, 2005. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In May 2003, Lalas applied to serve the remainder 
of his sentence in Greece under the Prisoner Transfer Treaty. 
 The United States received no documentation in support of 
the transfer request from the Greek government.  The FBI, 
U.S. Attorney, and U.S. counterintelligence officials 
strongly opposed the request, and it was denied.  In July 
2005, the GoG informally requested information on the 
provisions of the supervised release of Lalas.  At that time, 
the Office of International Affairs at DOJ confirmed that it 
would strongly oppose a request for Lalas to travel to 
Greece, and would be "very much opposed" to a transfer of 
Lalas' supervised release to Greece under the Prisoner 
Transfer Treaty, noting the offense is too serious to 
consider transfer of the supervision. 
 
RECOMMENDATION 
-------------- 

¶4.  (C) Embassy Athens sees little foreign policy benefit in 
granting the current GoG request and therefore recommends 
against an effort to arrange for Lalas to serve the remainder 
of his supervised release in Greece.  The release of the 
letter to the press, even before it was delivered to us, 
indicates that this is largely intended for public 
consumption.  We believe that not meeting the request will 
not harm our bilateral relationship with Greece.  In a 
courtesy reply, however, we suggest we focus on the fact that 
the terms of Mr. Lalas' parole are the responsibility of the 
independent judiciary.  This would parallel the Greek 
Ministry's response to our request for help in the case of 
Seamen Vossler and Wright. 
 
¶5.  (U) Attached is the text of two letters from the Justice 
Minister: 
 
LETTER TO AMBASSADOR RIES 
 
Hellenic Republic 
The Minister of Justice 
Athens, 16/6/2006 
Ref: 244 
 
His Excellency 
Mr. Charles P. Ries 
Ambassador of the United States of America 
 
 
Dear Ambassador, 
 
I am sending you herewith my letter addressed to the Attorney 
General of the U.S. Mr. Alberto Gonzalez, concerning the 
issue of Steven Lalas. 
 
I am counting on your support for the fulfillment of my 
request. 
 
Yours sincerely, 
 
/s/ 
 
Anastasis Papaligouras 
 
LETTER TO ATTORNEY GENERAL: 
 
Hellenic Republic 
The Minister of Justice 
 
Athens, 16/6/2006 
Ref: 242 
 
The Attorney General of the U.S. 
Mr. Alberto R. Gonzalez 
U.S. Department of Justice 
950 Pennsylvania Ave., NW 
Washington D.C.  20530-0001 
 
Dear Colleague, 
 
I would hereby like to bring to your attention the issue of 
Mr. Steven Lalas.  As you are certainly aware, Mr. Lalas is a 
U.S. citizen of Greek origin who was convicted in the U.S. in 
1993 to imprisonment of 168 months for delivering defense 
information to a foreign government.  His term of 
imprisonment has now been completed and Mr. Lalas has been 
for approximately one year serving supervised release for a 
term of five years. 
 
As Mr. Lalas's wife and children are now permanent residents 
in Greece, it is important for purely humanistic reasons to 
allow him to serve this secondary penalty, for its remaining 
period, in Greece.  The Greek judicial authorities and the 
Greek government shall undertake to honor all standard 
conditions of supervision imposed on Mr. Lalas by the United 
States District Court, Eastern District of Virginia in case 
number 1: 93 CR00239-001. 
 
I wish to underline the positive effect that a decision 
allowing Mr. Lalas to serve the remainder of his supervised 
release in Greece would create and the considerable goodwill 
for the relations of our two countries.  Furthermore, it 
would enhance the already good working relationship between 
our two Departments. 
 
It is my sincere hope that you will give the matter your 
attention and that you will react positively to my request. 
 
Yours sincerely, 
 
/s/ 
 
Anastasis Papaligouras
