TWO-WEEK TRUCE 
 
REF: A) ABIDJAN 560 B) ABIDJAN 549 
 
¶1.  (U) The coordination of university professors known as 
Coordination Nationale des Enseignants du Superieur et des 
Chercheurs (CNEC), has called a two-week truce after meeting 
with Prime Minister Banny on May 29.  While the Prime 
Minister was not able to promise a salary increase, which is 
CNEC's main demand, Banny did put three concessionary offers 
on the table:   a delay in the mandatory retirement age from 
60 to 62, an increase in research bonuses to USD 1,200 for 
junior lecturers and USD 2,200 for full professors, and 
permission for professors over the age of 65 who have not yet 
completed 30 years in service to continue teaching. 
Currently, professors must retire at 65 regardless of the 
number of years of service.  CNEC's members have resumed 
teaching duties until June 11, while they discuss the Prime 
Minister's proposal and attempt to negotiate further 
concessions from the government. 
 
¶2.  (U) What is CNEC:  The university professors, 
coordination is a group of professors and researchers that 
was created ten months ago to address the professors' unmet 
demands for salary increases, and research and housing 
allowances.  Although union-like in appearance and actions, 
CNEC is not a legally registered Ivoirian union.  Two other 
formal teachers' unions already exist: the Syndicat National 
de la Recherche et l,Enseignement Superieur (SYNARES) and 
Union Nationale de l,Enseignement Superieur et de la 
Recherche (UNESUR).  It is widely understood by the 
rank-and-file that CNEC is the only active, apolitical 
organization that carries the support and power of the 
professors.  Approximately 80% of professors support CNEC's 
actions, arguing that the existing unions failed to defend 
the aspirations of their members on the key issues and are 
too pro-FPI to advocate for the rank-and-file in a balanced 
way.  Legally CNEC does not have the right to organize a 
strike.  The reality, however, is that this "coordination" 
body has succeeded in paralyzing university activity and 
suspending classes for more than 40,000 students because its 
members have respected CNEC's call to strike.  The Prime 
Minister has recognized CNEC as the popular representative of 
the university professors.  For that reason, Banny refused to 
heed the call of the Minister of Labor, Civil Servants and 
Administrative Reform to suspend the salaries of the 
professors participating in an "illegal strike" and Banny has 
agreed to continue his talks with the CNEC.
