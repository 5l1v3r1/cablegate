¶1.  (SBU) Citing deteriorating economic conditions, the 
United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian 
Affairs (OCHA) has revised its original appeal for the West 
Bank and Gaza upwards from USD 215 million to USD 385 
million.  OCHA head David Shearer said the new funding was 
predominantly for job creation and cash assistance to the 
most vulnerable, medical supplies and food to the growing 
'most at-risk' groups identified by United Nations Relief and 
Works Agency (UNRWA) and World Food Program (WFP).  Shearer 
stressed that UN assistance was intended to alleviate 
conditions and could not substitute for existing PA social 
services. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Shearer said the PA budget crisis had undermined 
the functioning of PA institutions, which provide the bulk of 
essential services to the Palestinian population.  These 
services include the operation of 75 percent of primary and 
secondary schools, 62 percent of all primary healthcare 
clinics, all the major hospitals, water network maintenance, 
and social and relief services to 45,000 families who are 
chronically unable to support themselves. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) UNRWA Deputy Commissioner General Filippo Grandi 
commented that on-the-ground indicators pointed to worsening 
conditions.  He said the waiting list to participate in 
UNRWA's emergency short-term employment program in Gaza had 
grown to 100,000, while the waiting list in the West Bank had 
increased six-fold over the last two months.  Applications to 
teach at UNRWA schools had risen from 1,700 to 5,000.  Grandi 
added that demand for UNRWA services was increasing in 
response to the decrease in public services. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) In late 2005 when the UN's Appeal for 2006 was 
launched requesting USD 215 million, the outlook appeared 
more positive.  To date, USD 71 million of that Appeal has 
been funded, or only about 36 percent of the total requests.
