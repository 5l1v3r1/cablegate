SITUATION 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  According to USAID staff in Gaza, there 
are no reports of critical food shortages, but Gazans are 
stocking up on food supplies.  Hospitals and clinics have 
emergency supplies for 14 days.  All crossings remain closed. 
 Diesel supplies are being quickly depleted, according to a 
gas station owner.  End summary. 
 
Food 
---- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Gazans are stocking up on basic commodities, 
according to USAID Gaza field staff.  Prices have risen: a 50 
kilogram bag of sugar now sells for NIS 200 (USD 45), up from 
NIS 155 (USD 35) June 27, and a 50 kilogram bag of wheat 
flour now sells for NIS 120 (USD 27), up from NIS 80 (USD 
18), June 27.  The World Food Program (WFP) estimates that 
Gaza wheat flour mills have a 24-day supply of wheat flour 
available.  According to World Health Organization (WHO) 
Gaza-based representative Mahmud Daher, Gazan are stocking up 
on food supplies based on how much they can afford.  He had 
no reports of depleted stocks of basic commodities in stores, 
but he predicted that fava beans, a high-protein source, 
would quickly run out due to over-consumption.  Daher and 
USAID Gaza-based field staff both confirmed that perishable 
items that required refrigeration, like dairy products, are 
beginning to spoil and supplies are dwindling.  According to 
the WFP, fisherman have not been able to fish since June 26, 
and small bakeries that depend on electric ovens have had to 
close. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Daher said that representatives from the United 
Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), the World Food 
Program, and the International Committee of the Red Cross 
(ICRC) met June 28 in Gaza to discuss food supplies.  He said 
representatives from the World Food Program (WFP) and  UNRWA 
concurred that there are no food shortages currently.  UNRWA 
is considering a one-time general food distribution (a 
one-month basket) to all refugees (roughly two-thirds of the 
population).  WFP head of office Arnold Vercken told 
EconChief June 27 that WFP had just finished its latest food 
distribution, so WFP's current non-refugee beneficiaries in 
Gaza have enough food for up to two months, but WFP is 
looking to expand its beneficiary list by up to 180,000. 
(Note: WFP is concerned, however, about losing access to its 
warehouse, with 900 metric tons of stocks, in the Gaza 
Industrial Estate adjacent to Karni/al-Mintar, should IDF 
forces occupy that area.  End note.) 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Daher said that the UN agencies are trying to 
predict how many newly-displaced families would need 
assistance.  He had received reports from the southeast of 
Rafah that an undetermined number of Palestinian families 
fled prior to the IDF incursion.  ICRC said it was preparing 
Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) kits for these families 
that contained a small tent, cutlery, small gas burner, 
blankets, cots, and hygiene supplies. 
 
Health 
------ 
 
¶5.  (SBU) USAID Gaza-based staff also reported that all 
public and private hospitals and clinics in Gaza have 
declared a state of emergency.  All public hospitals and 
primary healthcare clinics have supplies for at least a 
14-day emergency; however, there were unconfirmed rumors June 
29 of a shortage of medical oxygen at hospitals.  The USAID 
EMAP III project delivered June 27 emergency kits of 
pharmaceuticals and medical supplies to NGO clinics in three 
different areas of Gaza: north and south Gaza and Khan Younis. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Acting UNRWA Gaza Field Director told Amman-based 
REFCOORD June 29 that six senior-level Palestinian UNRWA 
staff members are stuck on the Egyptian-side of the Rafah 
crossing and are unable to enter Gaza, including the Field 
Chiefs of Relief and Health, and the only cardiologist in 
Gaza.  All crossings into Gaza remained closed June 28 and 
¶29. 
 
Water 
----- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Existing stocks of liquid chlorine used in water 
treatment are predicted to last about four weeks, USAID 
Gaza-based field staff reported.  40 cubic meters of chlorine 
have been allocated to the Palestinian Water Authority (PWA) 
and an additional 15 cubic meters to hospitals and UNRWA. 
 
UNRWA officials told REFCOORD that they have a limited 
ability to provide diesel for water well pumps.  UNRWA's 
reserve fuel stocks are estimated at 100,000 liters.  The 
governorate of Khan Younis asked UNRWA June 28 for fuel in 
order to operate its 25 wells, which consume 5,000 liters of 
fuel daily. 
 
Fuel 
---- 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Cooking gas is unavailable in Gaza, according to 
Gaza gas station owner Abu Hisham al-Khozendar.  USAID Gaza 
field staff reported a high level of diesel sales due to 
increased use of generators.  They estimated that supplies 
would run out in two days, given that people are stocking up. 
 Al-Khozendar told EconSpecialist June 29 that Israeli fuel 
deliveries to Gaza have ceased at Nahal Oz.  According to the 
Financial and Commercial Manager of the Gaza Power Plant June 
29, the plant currently has six million liters of industrial 
diesel which could be used for large generators.  (Note: 
There are seven main retail fuel stations in Gaza, which sell 
80-90 percent of all non-industrial diesel.  Normal diesel 
consumption is 500,000 liters per day and stations have a 
storage capacity of 5 million liters, a ten-day supply 
normally.  On June 27, these stations were at about half 
capacity.  End Note.)  USAID Gaza-based field staff also 
received reports that companies are removing equipment from 
gas stations, because they are afraid of damage during 
Israeli military operations.  Generator sales continue to be 
brisk, according to both al-Khozendar and USAID Gaza-based 
field staff.
