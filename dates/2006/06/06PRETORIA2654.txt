AGREEMENTS WITH CHINA 
 
REF: PRETORIA 678 
 
¶1. (U) Summary. Leading a delegation of government officials and 
business leaders, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao visited South Africa 
June 21-22, 2006.  The Chinese visit was part of a seven-country 
tour of Africa intended to strengthen China's diplomatic ties, 
ensure robust trade, and secure its access to a variety of natural 
resources from the continent.  Jiabao and South African President 
Thabo Mbeki initialed a textile MoU, containing import limitations 
on 31 textile and apparel categories until 2008.  Jiabao also 
witnessed agreements between several Chinese companies and Sasol to 
investigate building at least 2 coal-to-liquid fuel plants.  In 
addition, China and South Africa signed a pact to cooperate on 
peaceful uses of nuclear technology.  With details sketchy, it is 
difficult to judge the value of the new agreements.  Septel covers 
political aspects of the visit.  End summary.

STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP SOUGHT 
---------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) On June 21 2006, South Africa and China initialed a 
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to promote trade and economic 
co-operation.  This MoU forms part of a package of agreements signed 
to strengthen the "strategic partnership" between the two countries 
and provides for technical assistance, investment and trade 
promotion, and customs cooperation.  Other agreements cover a 
variety of fields including agriculture, health, defense, 
transportation, arts and culture, and cooperation in science and 
technology. 
 
------------------------------------- 
CHINA AGREES TO LIMIT TEXTILE IMPORTS 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) The textile MOU includes import limitations on 31 apparel and 
textile product categories until the end of 2008.  The South African 
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) could not provide concrete 
detail regarding the specific product categories identified.  The 
DTI said in a statement that more detail on the agreement will only 
be made available once it comes into force, and that legal 
procedures still needed to be completed. 
 
¶4. (U) As reported reftel, the South African clothing and textile 
sector has experienced severe pressures partly as a result of rising 
imports from China.  Imports currently account for 30 percent of the 
South African clothing and textiles market.  Of this, China supplies 
more than three-fourths of the clothing and less than one-fourth of 
the textiles.  The following table shows China's share of the South 
African 2005 import market for apparel and textiles.

¶5. (U) Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao expressed his willingness to 
restrict textile exports and enhance South Africa's own capacity in 
textile production.  The Premier stated that China would be willing 
to cap its textile exports to South Africa at two-thirds its current 
level through 2008, though precise export limits for each of the 100 
product lines covered by the textile agreement would be decided 
through bilateral negotiations over the next several months.

TEXTILE UNIONS WELCOME MOU; BUSINESS AWAITS DETAILS 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶6. (U) Reactions to the announced import limitations were mixed. 
The South African Clothing and Textile workers Union hailed the MOU 
 
PRETORIA 00002654  002 OF 002 
 
 
as a chance to rebuild the local clothing and textile industry and 
to restore the 63,000 jobs lost in the industry during the past 
three years.  Industry representatives welcomed the agreement but 
nevertheless felt that the real value could only be judged when more 
detail becomes available.  An independent consultant described it as 
"too little to late".  However, Deputy President Phumzile 
Mlambo-Ngcuka welcomed the understanding reached on textile trade, 
describing it as a unique deal proving the Chinese willingness to 
walk the extra mile. 
 
¶7. (U) If the terms are as sweeping as those pledged by the Chinese 
delegation last week, industry representatives state that they will 
invest in both new factory technology and in training for workers to 
regain a competitive edge in delivery speed, defect rates, inventory 
holdings, and production flexibility.  A South African textile 
worker earns, on average, 3.5 times the wage of her Indian 
counterpart and 57 percent more than a comparable Chinese worker, 
according to data supplied by the Financial Mail.  The decline of 
the industry since the mid-1990s can be attributed to slow adoption 
to modern technology, the relatively strong rand in recent years, 
small target markets, and the expiration of the Multi-Fiber 
Agreement as well as increased foreign competition. 
 
------------------- 
NUCLEAR COOPERATION 
------------------- 
 
¶8. (U) China and South Africa also signed a pact to cooperate on 
peaceful uses of nuclear technology.  Key cooperative areas include 
the mining and supply of uranium ore; sharing power reactor 
operations techniques and components for use in the Koeburg Power 
Station; joint development of nuclear reactors, with possible 
cooperation in the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor Program (PBMR); and 
exchange of personnel in the nuclear field. 
 
¶9. (SBU) With electricity demands growing to challenging levels, 
especially in the Western Cape Province, the South African 
Government is supporting ambitious plans to bulk up the power grid, 
including adding another conventional nuclear power station and 
several pebble-powered nuclear generators to the power grid.  The 
combination of increasing electricity demands and the push to 
support PBMR development have led to a renewed South African drive 
for international cooperation in the nuclear field.  In addition to 
the China agreement, South Africa is negotiating agreements with 
Argentine, South Korea and Turkey. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
JOINT STUDIES FOR NEW COAL-TO-LIQUID FUEL PLANTS 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶11. (U) During the visit, South Africa chemical and fuel giant SASOL 
signed deals with Shenhua Ningxia Coal and with a consortium led by 
Shenhua Corporation to investigate the feasibility of coal-to-liquid 
(CTL) plants in China.  Both feasibility studies are based on the 
concept of 80,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) plants run using Sasol's 
proprietary Fisher-Tropsch technology.  Sasol expects to produce 
53,000 bpd of diesel, 24,000 bpd naphtha and 6,000 bpd of liquefied 
petroleum gas according to data supplied by the company.  Both of 
China's $5 billion plants could be operational by 2012.  Running at 
full capacity, they would reduce Chinese oil imports by 15 percent. 
While China enjoys abundant coal reserves, it presently imports 40 
percent of its oil and is the world's second-largest oil importer.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶12. (SBU) With details sketchy, it is difficult to determine whether 
the new agreements are advantageous to both sides.  At best, a 
textile agreement will buy time for marginal firms to rebuild and 
become more competitive, but it is certainly no panacea.  The more 
likely long-term outcome is that those marginal firms will continue 
their downward slide.  On the energy front, China gains access to 
South African technology and uranium reserves, while South Africa 
hopes to gain assistance in alleviating the ongoing power shortages 
in the Western Cape.  Time will tell whether South Africa has made a 
good bargain with the Chinese.  TEITELBAUM
