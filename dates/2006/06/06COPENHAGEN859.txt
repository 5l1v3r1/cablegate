¶1. (SBU) Embassy conveyed reftel points in support of 
Ambassador Litt's candidacy to MFA Deputy Director for 
International Security Michael Lund Jeppesen and MFA NATO 
Section Chief Maria Egense.  Egense responded June 15 by 
stressing that Denmark believes both Amb. Litt and the Dutch 
candidate Ambassador Everts are well qualified to fill the 
role of Senior Civilian Representative in Afghanistan (SCR). 
 
¶2. (SBU) Egense added that Denmark does not intend to lobby 
for either candidate, but if asked for a preference by the 
NATO SecGen, will lean toward the Dutch candidate.  Egense 
cited the geographical proximity of Denmark's deployment to 
the Dutch deployment in ISAF III expansion as a key factor 
behind the Danish position.
