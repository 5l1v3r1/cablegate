¶1. (U) This is a Babil PRT Cable 
 
¶2. (SBU) SUMMARY.  During a May 25 meeting, the Education 
Director General (DG, a provincial representative from the 
national ministry) for Babil, Dr. Hummadi Al-Awadi, told 
Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) staff that the current 
state of education in the province is deplorable and that 
substantial U.S. assistance is urgently required.  The DG 
complained that while the United States continues to provide 
small gifts of school supplies and other "minor trinkets," 
Coalition Forces must engage in large scale construction 
projects in order to substantially improve the quality of 
education in the province.  PRT staff stressed to the DG that 
the team and the Regional Embassy Office (REO) have been 
actively involved in supporting educational endeavors throughout 
the province, and will continue to do so, but that such ornate 
projects, including the DG's suggestion to build two great 
halls, are impractical.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3. (SBU) PRT staff met with the DG of Education for the purpose 
of improving cooperation between Coalition Forces and local 
school districts and to coordinate U.S. military visits to 
individual schools.  The DG stated at the opening of the meeting 
that while he was highly appreciative of the U.S. military's 
willingness to provide basic school supplies, including pencils 
and notebooks, he expressed disappointment that the PRT and 
Coalition Forces have failed to engage in large scale projects 
including the construction of school buildings. (COMMENT: 
Coalition efforts have focused in the past on the reconstruction 
of damaged schools and not the construction of new schools. 
USAID has refurbished 165 schools in the province at a cost of 
$6.1 million.  School supplies provided by Coalition Forces in 
Babil have been at the initiative of USAID and individual 
military units and not organized by the PRT or other Coalition 
Forces.  END COMMENT). 
 
¶4. (SBU) The DG further explicated that Coalition partners 
previously implemented small scale donation campaigns, similar 
to current U.S. efforts, with little success.  One of the DG's 
aides who attended the meeting took a harsher tone and related 
that such previous projects were a considerable "waste of time 
and money".  The DG added a public diplomacy aspect to the 
conversation, contending that terrorists are exploiting the 
widely perceived notion that Coalition Forces only provide 
symbolic assistance.  Mimicking a terrorist, the DG mocked, 
"What?  Those Americans provide you with only paper and pencils 
[and not with substantial reconstruction programs]?"  These 
types of charges, he continued, "will convince the common 
person" that the United States is unenthusiastic about helping 
the people of Babil. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The DG further declared that all levels of education, 
including primary, secondary and tertiary, in Babil are facing 
an impending crisis due to a lack of space, supplies and faculty 
training.  One aide added that the educational facilities in 
Babil are "not better than caves and ruins" and that he hoped 
Coalition Forces would help to redress this problem, as 
"brothers in humanity."  At the conclusion of the meeting, a 
second aide stated that Babil requires 400 new schools (there 
are approximately 300 students per school), comprehensive 
teacher training and technical expertise to create new syllabi. 
The aide also requested that the PRT Deputy Leader ask the U.S. 
military to provide security for students and teachers during 
upcoming examinations in June. 
 
¶6. (SBU) REO and PRT staff had previously met with officials 
from Babil University.  The administrators of the university 
echoed a similar theme, arguing that the United States has a 
moral obligation to rebuild the educational infrastructure of 
the institute.  Without direct U.S. aid, these administrators 
declared, they would remain unable to develop their university. 
 
¶7. (SBU) COMMENT: Babil, in relationship to the rest of 
South-Central Iraq, possesses a well educated population, marked 
with higher than average literacy rates and a relatively 
dedicated educational staff.  While the state of education in 
Babil may not be in such dire straits as portrayed by the DG of 
Education, there is no doubt that there is much room for 
improvement.  Unfortunately, it is the experience of PRT staff 
that most public officials, including educators, make 
unrealistic demands that Coalition Forces are simply unable to 
meet.  Moreover, when officials resort to the tactic of casting 
a wide net to see what they can get, it makes it difficult for 
the PRT to accurately judge what the real needs are.  For 
example, the DG of Education failed to mention that the Ministry 
of Education is currently building 48 new schools this year at a 
cost of $7 million.  Nor did he mention that Coalition Forces 
have earmarked $22 million for Babil University from Iraqi

development funds during the previous fiscal year.  END COMMENT.
