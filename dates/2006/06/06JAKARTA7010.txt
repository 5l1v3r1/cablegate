SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (U) As of June 2, the GOI continued to report 6,234 dead 
and 46,148 injured, with no Americans among the dead or 
injured.  NGOs appear primarily concerned about the lack of 
potable water. As of June 1, USAID's Office of Foreign 
Disaster Assistance has provided 1,660,682 USD in assistance 
for the earthquake victims, out of a total pledge of 5 
million USD.  The U.S. military field hospital continues to 
treat patients, while U.S. military doctors also assist local 
medical facilities.  End Summary. 
 
CASUALTIES 
---------- 
 
¶2. (U) The GOI Department of Social Affairs, on June 1, 
revised its official count of earthquake victims to 6,234 
dead, 33,231 seriously injured, and 12,917 lightly injured. 
The Department of Social Affairs estimated 233,237 homes 
destroyed by the earthquake.  We have seen no June 2 update 
to those figures.  We have no reports of Amcits dead or 
injured or of unidentified foreigners at any medical 
facility.  We have resolved all w/w inquires concerning 
Americans reportedly in the Yogyakarta area. 
 
CIVILIAN RELIEF EFFORT 
---------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) The full nine-member USAID Disaster Assistance 
Response Team (DART) has arrived in the earthquake area.  The 
DART has noted an absence of large concentrations of 
internally displaced persons (IDPs).  Families remain in the 
vicinity of their damaged homes or reside elsewhere with 
relatives and acquaintances. 
 
¶4. (U) The DART notes that NGOs have concerns about the lack 
of potable water.  Affected populations lack kerosene and 
cooking stoves to boil poor quality water. 
 
¶5. (U) USAID attends donor coordination meetings in 
Yogyakarta.  The meetings will now occur every other day. 
 
¶6. (U) As of June 1, USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster 
Assistance has provided 1,660,682 USD in assistance for the 
earthquake victims, out of a total pledge of 5 million USD. 
 
¶7. (U) Many U.S. firms in Indonesia developed close ties with 
the donor community after the 2004 tsunami and have 
capitalized on those, moving supplies and aid quickly and 
efficiently in Central Java.  (Additionally, ref A described 
an Amcham donation to quake victims.)  The business 
community, currently looking at short-term relief efforts, 
will soon focus on supporting long-term reconstruction 
efforts. 
 
¶8. (U) The European Commission has committed to providing 3 
million Euros through the Commission's aid agency, ECHO, and 
has dispatched four technical experts to work with the UN and 
IFRC.  Several EU member states have provided material 
support including tents, blankets, and medical supplies 
(Austria, Belgium, France, Italy, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, 
Spain).  Four EU member states have offered financial 
support, including 5.5 million USD from the UK, 1.3 million 
USD from the Netherlands, and smaller commitments from 
Germany and Ireland. 
 
U.S. MILITARY ACTIVITY IN EARTHQUAKE AREA 
----------------------------------------- 
 
JAKARTA 00007010  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
 
¶9. (U) We have approximately 110 U.S. military personnel on 
the ground in the earthquake area, under the command of USMC 
BGEN Panter.  Several KC-130 flights landed on June 1, along 
with a C-17, which brought 16 pallets of support equipment, 
including generators and security surveillance equipment. 
KC-130 flights to date total over a dozen.  We have begun 
receiving additional capabilities, such as x-ray, dental, and 
lab type equipment as well as bulk water purification and 
showers (primarily for patients). 
 
¶10. (U) Medical personnel at our treatment facility treated 
over 100 patients on June 1.  They have continued to treat a 
continuous flow of patients.  U.S. military doctors do basic 
clinic work on an ongoing basis, and perform significant 
outpatient procedures and surgeries. 
 
¶11. (U) U.S. military doctors have gone to local medical 
facilities, assisting with treatment at those sites or 
routing/transporting some patients to our treatment facility. 
 
¶12. (U) The Indonesian Armed Forces (TNI) estimate that TNI 
will run the rescue and relief operations for 10-14 days and 
then turn it over to civilian organizations. 
 
¶13. (U) U.S. military personnel at the airport assisted the 
Japanese in offloading their equipment; the Japanese will 
establish a field hospital and deploy mobile primary care 
medical teams.  The Malaysians also will start operations in 
the affected area. 
 
MEDIA COVERAGE 
-------------- 
 
¶14. (U) Indonesian papers expressed concern that the 
"distribution of assistance and supplies is still 
disorganized" (Koran Tempo) and claim that "survivors go 
hungry with food scarce" (Jakarta Post).  International media 
continue to hunt for the bad news, with the New York Times 
reporting "400 quake victims dying each day in overcrowded 
hospitals."  (Given the injury estimates above, this would 
indicate a fatality rate among the seriously injured of below 
two percent.)  Despite the media's apparent thirst for the 
bad news, papers also provided positive coverage, including 
of U.S. assistance.  The press widely covered the 
Ambassador's visit, which helped focus attention on the U.S. 
A private sector contribution of 2 million USD cooperatively 
organized by "the Church of Jesus Christ" (sic - we assume 
this is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) and 
the U.S. Islamic Relief (Council) received front page 
coverage in one major paper as well as the national 
television news station with the following comment: "This 
assistance shows that the U.S. is concerned about 
humanitarian issues without distinction of religion, 
nationality, race or ethnicity.  This contribution was made 
jointly by Muslims and Christians in the U.S.  It is a 
message for us in Indonesian to rethink our sense of 
solidarity."
