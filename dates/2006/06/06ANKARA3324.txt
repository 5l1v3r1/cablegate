SUBJECT: TURKEY AND IRAQ FINALLY MEET ON REGIONAL WATER 
 
¶1.  (sbu) Summary: Tigris-Euphrates river flows and 
irrigation issues were the main subjects at an historic May 
24 meeting in Ankara between Turkish and Iraqi water 
experts.  Topics included use of "closed system" irrigation 
in Turkey and restoration efforts for the marshlands in 
Iraq.  The Turkish side was generally satisfied with the 
meeting and reiterated its position that it is always ready 
to cooperate with Iraq on management of the shared rivers 
system.  End Summary.

Water Flows and Irrigation 
-------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (sbu) Following failed attempts to meet earlier this 
year, Turkey finally met with Iraq water officials to start 
sharing information on water flows and uses.  GOT MFA water 
department head Esen Altug described the May 24 meeting in 
Ankara between Turkish and Iraqi water officials as historic 
and a good start after a lapse of 14-15 years without 
meeting.  She said representatives from the Turkish 
Ministries of Energy and Agriculture and DSI (State Water 
Works Agency) received Iraqi officials from the Ministry of 
Water Resources to discuss a range of technical water 
issues.  Both sides gave presentations on topics such as the 
use of "closed system" irrigation in Turkey, restoration of 
the marshlands in Iraq, and projected river flows for the 
Tigris-Euphrates. 
 
¶3.  (sbu) The Deputy Director General of DSI hosted and 
presented Turkey's water and hydroelectric sitatution at the 
one-day meeting.  Altug encouraged us to meet directly with 
DSI to get a more technical read-out and obtain a copy of 
Turkey's powerpoint presentation in English. 
 
¶4.  (sbu) According to Altug, the Iraqi delegation expressed 
interest in considering bringing the "closed system" type of 
irrigation system used in Turkey to Iraq.  Embassy Baghdad 
told us that Turkey specifically questioned the Iraqis about 
the Mosul dam and pollution flowing from the irrigation 
drainage waters flowing into the Gulf, but Altug was not 
able or willing to confirm this line of inquiry. 
 
¶5.  (sbu) According to Altug, the Iraqis provided general 
information on the current water situation in Iraq, 
including river flows for the year to date.  The Turks also 
provided an update on the water situation for the Tigris and 
the Euphrates for the coming year.  Altug was aware that 
Turkey had provided an additional 200 cms flow on the 
Euphrates last year, but she did not know the projection for 
this year. 
 
------------------ 
Future Discussions 
------------------ 
 
¶6.  (sbu) The MFA rep expressed general satisfaction with 
the meeting and informed us that they would work together on 
direction and timing of future discussions between the two 
countries, but nothing specific had yet been agreed upon. 
She expressed the standard Turkish position that it is 
always ready to cooperate with Iraq. 
 
¶7.  (sbu) Altug complained that the Iraqi presentation was 
oral with written copies only in Arabic.  She said the Iraqi 
Embassy in Ankara was preparing English translations and the 
Iraqi delegation promised to provide an electronic copy of 
the presentation.  Altug also asserted that Iraq had not 
provided a full response to Turkey's information request 
from 2004. 
 
¶8.  (sbu) Comment:  We will pursue a more detailed read-out 
and the Turkish presentation from DSI.  We believe that a 
fruitful next step in encouraging regional cooperation, 
trust, and information exchange would be a program like the 
joint Embassies Baghdad and Ankara proposal for the Tigris- 
Euphrates River Basin Cooperation Initiative which would 
entail a two-week Voluntary Visitor Program for Turkish and 
Iraqi officials.
