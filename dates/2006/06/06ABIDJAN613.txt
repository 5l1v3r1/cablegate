SUBJECT: COTE D'IVOIRE:  FINAL NUMBERS FROM PILOT ID PROGRAM 
 
REF: ABIDJAN 583 
 
¶1.  (U) The Ivorian government announced the official figures 
for the pilot identification process which ended on May 27. 
The official figures are:  5003 applicants were interviewed, 
3907 birth certificates were granted, and 3137 certificates 
of nationality were approved.  The analysis of the pilot 
identification program was part of the agenda for the May 31 
meeting of the Council of Ministers.  The results were 
reported on June 6 along with other agenda items. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The official figures differ somewhat from the 
figures compiled by the UN.  According to sources at the UN, 
a total of 3920 birth certificates and 2949 certificates of 
nationality were approved out of 5284 interviewed candidates. 
 In our opinion, the UN figures are more reliable due to 
regular, on-the-spot reporting from all seven sites during 
the pilot.  The 5.6 percent difference between the official 
figures and the UN's internal numbers is likely due to the 
pilot ID process' complicated and completely non-automated 
nature.
