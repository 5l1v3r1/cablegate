¶1. (U) SUMMARY:  Taiwan medical researchers have demonstrated 
the existence of lung stem cells and identified them as a 
critical target for infection by the SARS virus.  This 
research may result in a vaccine being developed to counter 
SARS.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2. (U) John Yu is a US citizen resarcher currently affiliated 
with the Genomics Research Center and the Institute of 
Cellular and Organism Biology of Academia Sinica (Taiwan's 
premier scientific research institute) told AIT that during 
the SARS outbreak of 2003 he observed that patients infected 
with SARS went into a peak infection period 10 days after 
contracting the disease, yet it took 3 weeks from initial 
contact before the lethal virus caused lung failure. 
According to Yu, the lag time is precisely the time needed 
for lung stem cells to grow new cells.  SARS attacked the 
embryonic stem cells at this juncture and prevented the 
generation of new stem cells thereby dealing a knockout blow 
to some patient's ability to recover. 
 
¶3. (U) Yu told AIT that before this discovery, lung failure 
was usually treated with anti-cancer medication.  This 
treatment only addressed the symptoms but did not cure the 
underlying problem.  His findings have been published in the 
authoritative Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 
in Washington DC.  Yu said that the next stage after the lung 
stem cell discovery is to try to grow enough of the stem 
cells so that a vaccine can be developed to counter SARS.
