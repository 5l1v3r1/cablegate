Polcouns delivered points on Iran to Interim Foreign Minister 
Abraham on June 1, per request in reftel.  Abraham noted that 
as he expected the Preval administration to name his 
successor any day, he could not himself respond to our 
request for support for our initiative.  He pledged to 
carefully review Secretary Rice's statement and brief 
President Preval at the earliest opportunity.
