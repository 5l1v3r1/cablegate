 ¶1.  (C)  Summary.  During a June 8 meeting with Acting 
Foreign Minister Ouch Borith, Charge delivered demarche 
points contained in reftels.  On Iran, Borith said the RGC 
would consider a public statement, and asked to see Secretary 
Rice's statement regarding the USG proposal, which the 
Embassy has forwarded to the MFA.  He noted that Cambodia has 
resisted invitations for high-level RGC officials to visit 
Iran.  On the NAM statement, Borith explained that Cambodia 
received the draft final document very late, and there had 
been no mention of Iran.  End Summary.

¶2.  (C)  On June 8, Charge d'Affaires and A/DCM met with 
Acting Foreign Minister and MFA Secretary of State Ouch 
Borith regarding reftel demarches concerning Iran and the NAM 
Statement.  On Iran, the Charge noted that the USG wishes to 
pursue a diplomatic solution to the nuclear question, and 
Secretary Rice's groundbreaking proposal is in keeping with 
 
SIPDIS 
that objective.  After summarizing the points included in 
reftel A, he asked that the RGC consider making a public 
statement in support of the USG proposal.  Borith asked for a 
copy of Secretary Rice's statement outlining the USG 
proposal.  Borith noted that Iran previously had issued 
invitations to the President of the National Assembly and the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs to visit Iran; Cambodia has 
always declined.  The Acting FM stated that Cambodia supports 
nonproliferation in principle and its voting record at the UN 
follows that policy.  He promised to consult with Minister 
Hor Namhong regarding the USG request.  Embassy forwarded a 
copy of Secretary Rice's statement to the MFA on June 9, and 
will follow up.

¶3.  (C)  On the NAM statement, Borith said that Cambodia was 
not wholly satisfied with the statement but went along with 
the consensus.  He added that Cambodia has reservations about 
Iran and the lack of transparency in the Government of Iran's 
dealings with the IAEA.  In principle, he noted, the NAM 
supports the peaceful use of nuclear power for non-military 
purposes.  The Charge stressed that Iran's program clearly 
was aimed at producing weapons and that IAEA analysis 
demonstrated that Tehran had something to hide.  Borith said 
that the RGC only received the draft of the final document 
and other conference materials very late; there was no 
mention of a statement on Iran.  He concurred that Singapore 
was the only country to offer spirited opposition to the 
statement.
