REF: STATE 92033 
 
Poloff discussed reftel points concerning negotiations of a 
Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty (FMCT) with MFA Disarmamant 
Office Director Dr. Aly June 7.  Dr. Aly responded that Egypt 
is not opposed to considering proceeding with the proposed 
negotiations without linkages to issues that require 
consensus.  Aly said Egypt agrees with the U.S. that the 
effectiveness of the CD has been compromised in recent years 
and Egypt would like to reverse this trend.  Aly also noted, 
however, that Egypt remains concerned about the U.S. position 
on verification.
