POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
ZAMAN / RADIKAL / HURRIYET / CUMHURIYET:        PKK militants opened 
fire and killed two soldiers patrolling the border area on foot 
at Hakkari's Semdinli district.  Two soldiers have been wounded. 
 Hurriyet daily notes that PKK members killed the soldiers by 
opening fire on a military vehicle. 
 
ZAMAN / EVRENSEL / SABAH:       PKK militants stopped four cars on 
a road between Tunceli and Hozat, made propaganda of the PKK to 
the drivers and kidnapped the driver of an official truck with 
his vehicle.  Terrorists then released the driver and left the 
truck at an unspecified spot where they reportedly placed TNT 
explosives around a gas canister.  The security officials safely 
cleared the area from explosives. 
 
SABAH:  PKK members reportedly carried out an attack with 
remote controlled mines on a military vehicle carrying the 
children of the security officers in Tunceli's Pulumur district. 
 Two soldiers have been wounded. 
 
ZAMAN / RADIKAL / YENI SAFAK / CUMHURIYET / SABAH:      The 
autopsy report of the Diyarbakir Forensic Authority about 
killing of Selahattin Aksu and his daughter in Mardin's 
Kiziltepe district on June 3 (see press summaries 06/05 and 06) 
said that the girl was 7 years old in contrast with reports of a 
pro-PKK newspaper yesterday, which claimed that the girl was 4 
years old.  There were 11 shots and 21 shot in the bodies of the 
daughter and father respectively, and the guns used were two 
Kalashnikovs.  Zaman daily also cited allegations that the 
father was a PKK defector until 1998.  The fact that Aksu was a 
defector turns the PKK among the suspects of the incident, reads 
Radikal daily. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM / EVRENSEL:        Ozgur Gundem daily today reported 
the age of the girl who was killed with her father in Kiziltepe 
as 7.  The daily further claimed that Aksu, the father who was 
killed, was detained a week ago by Jandarma officials that found 
Cannabis plant in the field Aksu worked at.  The daily cites the 
allegations of the owner of the field, Davut Bozan, that 
Jandarma could have placed the Cannabis sacks on the field then. 
 The daily further reported that Aksu participated in a protest 
activity against PM Erdogan when Erdogan came to Mardin last 
weekend. 
 
RADIKAL / HURRIYET / CUMHURIYET / SABAH:        Fuat Gecen, Hatay 
deputy from AKP, has been dismissed from the party after being 
sent to the disciplinary committee for voicing allegations about 
irregularities of AKP officials with public tenders in Hatay. 
 
HURRIYET:       The daily reported that one of the suspects of a 
rape incident that took place in Van's Muradiye district (see

summer of 2004 for being a member of the terrorist organization 
PKK. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:   Members from the Delegation of the European 
Commission to Turkey paid a visit to the district mayor of

Diyarbakir administrators (see press summary 04/07) to the 
Prosecutor's Office of the SCA.  The daily said that this

the closure of DTP.
