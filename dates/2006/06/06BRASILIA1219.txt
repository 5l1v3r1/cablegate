SUBJECT: BRAZIL STILL EVALUATING WEDGEWOOD RE-ELECTION BID 
 
REF: STATE 85758 
 
Â¶1. Poloff delivered reftel's talking points to Marcia Adorno of the 
MFA's Division for Human Rights.  During the discussion Adorno 
reflected on Wedgewood's "impressive resume" and record as an 
incumbent, making special note of Wedgewood's demanding analysis of 
Brazil's latest report.  However, Adorno was unable verify whether 
Brazil would support Wedgewood's nomination claiming that the GoB is 
"still evaluating" candidates.  She followed this declaration by 
noting that the GoB has already agreed to support several other 
candidates, for a limited number of seats; although, she was unaware 
of how many others and whether the GoB still had votes available to 
support other nominations.  Adorno has agreed to look into the 
situation further and provide additional information at a later 
time.
