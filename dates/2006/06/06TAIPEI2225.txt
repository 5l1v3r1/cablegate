AIT Econ Chief delivered reftel demarches to Director General 
of Taiwan's Bureau of Foreign Trade Huang Chi-peng (Franco) 
on June 27.  Huang noted that EU Trade Commissioner Peter 
Mandelson had requested a meeting June 29 and 30 on the 
margins of the Green Room meeting on NAMA, specifically to 
discuss Services.  In addition to the Green Room 
participants, Commissioner Mandelson has also invited Hong 
Kong and Taiwan.  In light of Minister of Economic Affairs 
Hwang's previously scheduled commitments, Taiwan will be 
represented by WTO Ambassador Lin Yi-fu.  DG Huang said he 
would circulate the U.S. points to the appropriate ministries 
and ensure that Ambassador Lin was aware of the the U.S. 
position prior to the meeting in Geneva.
