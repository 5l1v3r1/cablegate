¶1. SUMMARY.  In its June overview of the French economy, the 
National Statistics Agency estimated 2006 GDP will increase 2 
percent in 2006, the low end of the original government forecast 
range of 2.0-2.5 percent on which the 2006 budget was based.  Any 
improvement in GDP growth above 2.0 percent largely depends on world 
economic growth, most notably stronger domestic demand in Germany, 
France's main trading partner.  END SUMMARY 
 
Economic Growth in France and the Euro Zone 
------------------------------------------- 
¶2.  In its June overview of the French economy, the National 
Statistics Agency (INSEE) noted that the French economy has 
experienced robust economic growth since summer 2005.  The 2.0 
percent growth in GDP (annualized) in Q-1 confirmed steady household 
consumption and a recovery in exports, both of which benefited from 
a dynamic world economy.  Despite increases in oil price prices, 
inflation remained moderate as price increases did not result in 
significant wage increases. 
 
¶3.  INSEE expects ECB interest rates to rise above 2.75 percent, 
which would increase long-term interest rates in the euro zone. 
These potential increases may offset any positive impact of higher 
domestic demand on economic growth.  Demand in the euro zone has 
risen considerably thanks notably to a recovery in domestic demand 
in Germany.  Taking into account the euro's gains against the US 
Dollar, INSEE foresees the ECB implementing monetary policies meant 
to bring economic growth in the euro zone back in line to around 2.1 
percent, a pace closer to its long-term trend. 
 
French GDP on a 2 percent Trend in 2006 
--------------------------------------- 
¶4.  In this context, the French economy would increase at a pace 
close to 2.0 percent in the second half of this year, but would not 
benefit from "any real acceleration."  INSEE predicted GDP to 
increase 2.0 percent (annualized) in 2006 after 1.2 percent in 2005. 
 GDP, which did increase 2.0 percent in Q-1 (ref), is forecast to 
increase 2.4 percent in Q-2, and to keep growing at the same pace in 
Q-3 and Q-4.  Growth in the construction and services sectors should 
offset modest 1 percent growth in the manufacturing sector which is 
due largely to poor performance in the automobile sector. 
 
¶5.  Michel Devilliers, INSEE's chief analyst, emphasized that 
household consumption seemed to be heading in the right direction. 
Consumption of manufactured products did well in April and May, this 
due in part to the soccer World Cup.  INSEE predicted household 
consumption to increase 2.6 percent thanks to a 2.4 percent increase 
in purchasing power.  That increase reflects moderate inflation (1.8 
percent in December over December 2005) and a decrease in the 
unemployment rate from 9.3 percent in April to 9.0 percent in 
December, close to the government goal of 8.9 percent.  INSEE 
expects the labor situation to improve not only because of a 
shrinking labor force and an increase in government-subsidized 
employment contracts, but also due to job creation in the private 
sector (20,000 jobs per quarter).  INSEE estimated that a total of 
196,000 jobs will be created in 2006, including 75,000 jobs in the 
private sector.  This figure is considerably higher than the 99,000 
jobs created in 2005, with only 63,000 jobs in the private sector. 
 
 
¶6.  INSEE forecast a 7.4 percent rebound in exports and a 10.5 
percent increase in exports of manufactured products, again due to 
strong foreign demand, notably from Germany, France's main trading 
partner.  When asked whether it would be preferable to have France 
or Germany win the World Cup, INSEE said it would prefer Germany 
because of the positive impact a victory would have on consumer 
confidence and domestic demand in the country, directly affecting 
French exports.  According to Devilliers, increased consumption in 
France was related first to an increase in purchasing power and not 
household confidence, which he deemed reassuring. 
 
¶7.  Even so, export growth would be insufficient to significantly 
boost corporate investment.  INSEE forecast corporate investment to 
pick up in Q-2, increasing to 3.8 percent in 2006; this would mirror 
2005 numbers but remain below levels normally seen in a period of 
economic recovery.  Corporate margins as a percent of value added 
are likely to deteriorate as productivity gains would increase less 
than labor costs. 
 
Mixed Risks 
----------- 
¶8.  INSEE's estimates are based on oil prices at 70USD per barrel 
and a Euro/US Dollar exchange rate at 1.27.  INSEE saw a possible

decrease in the US Dollar against the euro, which could occur should 
U.S. budget and current account deficits sink further into the red, 
as a major risk.  Increases in the prices of raw materials could 
also create fears about the resurgence of inflation.  On a positive 
note, INSEE did not exclude the possibility that a surge in the 
world economy in the very short-term could give some dynamic 
economic growth in the euro zone, including France. 
 
Comment 
------- 
¶9.  France does not seem to benefit fully from world economic 
growth.  INSEE's 2006 GDP growth forecast is at the low end of the 
government's original estimates, ranging from 2.0-2.5 percent for 
¶2006.  This discrepancy may fuel questions about the accuracy of 
government estimates, especially since Parliamentary deputies 
started on June 22 to debate the broader aspects of the 2007 
budget.
