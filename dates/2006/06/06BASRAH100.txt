¶1.      Summary.  On June 8, the Regional Embassy Office (REO) 
organized an event at the Basrah Business Center (BBC) for the 
political, religious and tribal leaders of Basrah to publicly 
sign a declaration of peace for the period of the 2006 World Cup 
in Germany, June 9 - July 9.  The event also included a speech 
by the Basrah Governor and the distribution of soccer 
paraphernalia to 30 children representing the Shia, Sunni and 
Christian communities in Basrah. The event was well attended by 
67 leaders and extensively covered by over 30 local and 
international media representatives. End Summary. 
 
¶2.      Attendees at the event included Basrah Governor Mohamed Al 
Wai'li (Fadhilla) Provincial Council (PC) Chairman Mohamed Obadi 
(Dawaa), PC members Sayed Bahaa Jamal Al Deen (Independent), 
Aqeel Talib (Fadhilla) and Munathil Abd Khanjar (Basrah Islamic 
List). Prominent religious leaders present included Sheik 
Mohamed Al Mutori, Head of the Shia Endowment, Sunni leader 
Sheik Khalid Al Mulla and Archbishop Gabriel Kassab. Tribal 
leaders were represented by Sheik Kadim Al Gatrani, Head of 
Basrah Tribal Council (Shia), Sheik Adnan Al Ghanim, Head of 
Tribal Coalition (Sunni). All these individuals and others 
signed the 3 ft. by 4 ft. document that proclaimed a month of 
peace during the World Cup so that the children and youth of 
Basrah may enjoy the games without the fear of violence. 
 
¶3.      The event was marked by a speech from the Governor and the 
distribution of soccer gifts to the children donated by British 
soccer star, David Beckham and the Real Madrid Football Club. 
In addition, during the event the news was received that Al 
Zarqawi had been killed. The announcement of this news by the 
Governor resulted in a loud cheer from the crowd of Basrah 
notables. 
 
¶4.      Comment: The event showed that the political, religious 
and tribal leaders of Basrah can gather together under one roof 
for an event that celebrates sports and children. More 
importantly, in a little over a week since the Prime Minister 
declared a "State of Emergency" in Basrah,  the leaders of this 
city seemed genuinely grateful and animated that they had all 
been brought together to publicly sign a declaration of a "State 
of Peace" for the World Cup. End Comment.
