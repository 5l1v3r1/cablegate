IRAQ 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: Wadah Khanfar, Director-General of the Al 
Jazeera Network, told PAO that Al Jazeera has asked the Iraqi 
government for permission to return to Baghdad and is 
awaiting a response. He said the decision to replace him as 
head of Al Jazeera Arabic is unlikely to occur before the end 
of this year and estimated that Al Jazeera English will 
launch about September. End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) During a June 8 meeting with PAO and visiting 
Chairman of the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) Kenneth 
Tomlinson, Wadah Khanfar, Director-General of the Al Jazeera 
Network (AJN), said Al Jazeera has asked the Iraqi government 
(GOI) for permission to return to Baghdad and is awaiting a 
response. Khanfar said the request had been made in the 
context of "ongoing talks" approximately four weeks ago. He 
said talks between Al Jazeera and the Iraqi government have 
been going on sporadically for at least the last year, if not 
longer. Khanfar said the GOI is afraid Al Jazeera will 
strengthen the "voice of the Sunni only" if allowed back into 
Baghdad. Asked if that was not an accurate apprehension, 
Khanfar said "it may be true now, because all the Iraqi Shia 
are boycotting us." He said Al Jazeera is unable to give 
proper weight to the Iraqi Shia voice because of the GOI 
boycott on Al Jazeera. If the channel is allowed to return 
and relations are "normalized", Al Jazeera would have access 
to more influential Shia voices and would be able to present 
a more balanced picture, Khanfar said. 
 
Khanfar's replacement at AJ Arabic & AJ English launch date 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
¶3. (U) Khanfar said that although he personally would like to 
see a replacement named for himself at Al Jazeera Arabic 
sooner rather than later, he doubted whether any decision 
would be taken by the AJN board "before the end of the year." 
He said the decision will probably occur after the launch of 
the Al Jazeera English channel. Asked about the launch date 
for the English channel, Khanfar said he expected to receive 
the technical all-clear on June 15, and after that "a month 
or two of pilots." He said he thought September is probably a 
realistic estimate. 
 
Khanfar the family man 
---------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) In response to questions from Chairman Tomlinson, 
Khanfar said he has four children, with the oldest twelve 
years old. He described his work week as a six-day work week, 
with Fridays off. He said he worked from 9am until 3pm, then 
went home until 5pm "to eat with the kids and spend time with 
them" before returning to work until 7, 8 or 10pm, depending 
on what is going on. Noting that "there is not too much to do 
in Doha," he said on Fridays he often takes his family out to 
the desert, to have an evening picnic meal and enjoy the 
desert night.
