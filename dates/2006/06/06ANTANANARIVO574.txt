SUBJECT: MADAGASCAR RESPONSE TO U.S. STATEMENT ON IRAN 
 
REF:  STATE 87682 
 
¶1. (SBU)  The Ambassador spoke to the President of 
Madagascar Marc Ravalomanana on June 1 to deliver Reftel 
talking points on the U.S. statement on Iran.  Ravalomanana 
expressed support for the U.S. action and concern regarding 
Iranian pursuit of nuclear weapons.  He added he would 
instruct his Foreign Minister to issue a statement. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Separately, the DCM made the same points in person 
to Foreign Minister Marcel Ranjeva.  In response, Ranjeva 
reiterated Malagasy support for the U.S. position regarding 
Iran, noting that he had expressed this clearly in the 
recent past when the Speaker of the National Assembly had 
made an unauthorized visit to Tehran.  Ranjeva noted that 
the GOM had expressed public opprobrium of Iran's nuclear 
activities at that time.  Ranjeva also said he would put the 
issue on the agenda for the next cabinet meeting, given the 
Ambassador's discussion with the President. 
 
¶3. (U)  Post will push the GOM for the promised statement 
and report details when possible.
