SUBJECT: TURKISH MFA RELEASES STATEMENT ON ISRAELI 
MOVEMENTS INTO GAZA STRIP 
 
 
¶1. (U) The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) released 
a statement on June 28 in response to the Israeli army's 
movements into the Gaza Strip. 
 
¶2. (U) Text of MFA statement.  Unofficial translation.  Begin 
text. 
 
We are deeply worried about the fact that the tension in the 
region has escalated with the entrance of the Israeli army 
into the Gaza Strip on June 28 following the June 25 attack 
by Palestinians groups on the Kerem Shalom border gate. 
 
It is unfortunate that this escalation occurred during a 
period when progress was being achieved in the establishment 
of common political ground among the Palestinian groups in 
support of the peace process.  Continuation of the tension 
and the conversion of it into hot clashes would only serve 
the interests of circles who do not want the establishment of 
a comprehensive and lasting peace in our region. 
 
Within this framework and in order to enable the elimination 
of the existing tension before it transforms into a deep 
crisis, we expect the kidnapped Israeli soldier to be turned 
over to the Israeli side and the Israeli military to end the 
operation it started in the Gaza Strip which damages 
Palestinian infrastructure and endangers the lives of 
civilians. 
 
We urge the sides to refrain diligently from acts that would 
foment violence and (to show) restraint and common sense in 
order to avoid a re-occurrence of developments that we have 
witnessed with sorrow in the past that cause nothing but 
blood and tears.
