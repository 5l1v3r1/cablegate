-- Hasan Al-Issa editorialized in the progressive Arabic daily under 
the title "Dry Their Ideological Wells" (6/10): "Zarqawi is dead and 
may his soul go to hell, but what of the thousands of Zarqawis in 
our Arab-Islamic world walking our streets, holding official 
positions, and issuing Fatwas about everything even the fundamentals 
of rule and the characteristics of the ruler?  What of those 
ideological fleas who have hijacked the state and society through 
their unwritten alliance between them and Arab regimes in the past? 
What do we do with them?  Is an American bomb weighing 250 kilograms 
dropped on their heads enough?....  There is no other way to combat 
Zarqawism than to dry up their terrorist wells. The education 
curriculum should be the starting point. Next, we should pursue the 
books sold and distributed for free throughout our Gulf entities 
under thousands of slogans." 
 
-- Mohamed Yousef Al-Mulaifi stated in the pro-government Arabic 
daily under the title "In the Lion's Death a Scandal for the 
American Rabbits" (6/11): "Despite our agreement or disagreement 
with the Jihadist orientation taken by Abu Musaab Al-Zarqawi in 
occupied Iraq, his killing revealed to the world how cowardly and 
scared Americans are in Iraq.  Their spokesman went on television 
screens before the world and reported how they killed Abu Musaab 
Al-Zarqawi and how they lack courage.  After they were sure that the 
field commander Abu Musaab Al-Zarqawi was sitting with a group of 
his fiends that can be counted on one hand, the Americans did not 
surround the place. They did not storm the location. They did not 
even fire missiles from the ground at the location. They were so 
scared that they sent two aircraft to bomb the house. What a wonder! 
 Abu Musaab Al-Zarqawi's power and the fear he struck in American 
hearts was so great that they could not face him with all of their 
land forces, which they mistakenly call the 'Marines.' Because they 
realized that they are up against one man who is worth 2,000 of 
them, they only could resort to aircraft to get at this lion's 
body." 
 
-- On the same page of pro-government Arabic daily Al-Seyassah 
Mahmoud Karam commented under the title "The Sad Zarqawis" (6/11): 
"I don't know how our Arab brothers saddened by Zarqawi's death will 
act. Some strong believers in conspiracy theories believe that he 
was only an American myth that did not really exist.  Now, they are 
in a real bind as they search for explanations to present to their 
audiences who also love conspiracy theories.  Other Arab brothers 
who long for the failure of democracy in Iraq and wait for their 
sick prophecies to be fulfilled when Zarqawi and other terrorists 
achieve their failed dream now suffer severe psychological problems. 
Terrorism in Iraq is now being fought with American and Iraqi 
determination.... None who mourn Zarqawi's death want to understand 
that just as the justice of history eliminated Saddam, it came 
through again to eliminate Zarqawi."
