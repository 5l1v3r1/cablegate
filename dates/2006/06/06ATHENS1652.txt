SUBJECT: PAKISTANI EMBASSY CLAIMS GOG COMPLICITY IN HUMAN 
SMUGGLING, SAYS NETWORKS FUND EXTREMISTS BACK HOME 
 
Classified By: AMB. CHARLES P. RIES FOR REASONS. 1.4(B) and (D) 
 
¶1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  In a June 16 meeting with Poloffs, 
Pakistani XXXXXXXXXXXX relayed his concerns that human smuggling 
could be funding destabilizing separatist, Muslim-extremist, 
and even terrorist movements in Pakistan, notably in the 
Balochistan province.  His concern is heightened by what he 
believes to be complicity by Greek authorities, and at the 
very least by lack of response by the GoG.  For this reason, 
he hopes for increased pressure on the GoG by USG and the EU. 
 END SUMMARY. 
 
---------------------- 
Context of the meeting 
---------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  On June 16, Poloffs met with Pakistani Embassy 
XXXXXXXXXXXX to discuss Pakistani migration to Greece and illegal immigrant detention conditions in Greece (septel).  XXXXXXXXXXXX was particularly eager to discuss these topics in the context of 
U.S.-Pakistani cooperation on domestic security in Pakistan 
and in the fight against terrorism. XXXXXXXXXXXX 
(Note: There is a population of between 50,000 and 75,000 
Pakistanis living in Greece, mostly in Athens. End Note).

Pakistani illegal immigration: possible USG and GoP security 
concern 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
¶3.  (C)  While he said there are almost no reliable 
statistics on migration to Greece (legal or illegal, 
Pakistani or otherwise), XXXXXXXXXXXX estimates that 
approximately 2,000 illegal Pakistani immigrants enter Greece 
each year, following a route through Iran and Turkey.  (Note: 
with reports in summer months of 200-plus migrants 
intercepted almost daily in the Aegean and crossing the Evros 
River, we see this as a conservative estimate. End Note). 
Although XXXXXXXXXXXX mentioned his concerns about the terrible 
conditions migrants encounter en route and the burdens of 
irregular migration on Greece, his greatest concern was the 
possible connection between the proceeds of Pakistani 
smuggling and the funding of destabilizing separatist, 
Muslim-extremist, and even terrorist movements in Pakistan. 
 
¶4.  (C)  According to XXXXXXXXXXXX, large amounts of "dirty 
money" involved in the smuggling are routed back to Pakistan 
through hawala, an informal money transfer system.  In the 
form of hawala described by XXXXXXXXXXXX, someone, usually a 
trusted friend or family member, physically transports cash 
from many sources/individuals and redistributes them at the 
destination, without any documentation or paper trail.  He 
remarked that Pakistan's Balochistan province, bordering 
Iran, is a primary destination for hawala funds, as it is a 
large source of smuggling operations and illegal immigrants, 
as well as a basis for separatist, extremist movements in 
Pakistan. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Complicity of the Greek government? 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (C)  XXXXXXXXXXXX claimed that the Pakistani Embassy has 
passed names of individuals involved in this form of hawala 
(and so probably also in smuggling) to the GoG, but has seen 
no response by the Ministries of Foreign Affairs or Public 
Order.  (Note: Hawala, in and of itself, is not illegal in 
Greece.  Greece does require declarations for import and 
export above certain amounts of funds, however.  At any rate, 
proceeds resulting from illegal activities are illegal, 
regardless of amount or how they are transferred.  End Note). 
 XXXXXXXXXXXX believes that what he sees as the GoG's lack of 
palpable concern is the combined result of: 1) lack of 
resources; 2) corruption; and 3) failure to collaborate 
generally with the Pakistani Embassy.  Of these three, 
corruption is the most troubling to XXXXXXXXXXXX, who has been 
told by Pakistani migrants that they crossed into Greece 
completely undisturbed by Greek border authorities, or were 
even transported in Greek military vehicles.  For this 
reason, XXXXXXXXXXXX believes that there is complicity in 
smuggling operations by Greek law enforcement authorities. 
He appealed to us, saying such complicity on the part of 
Greek authorities is detrimental to the common fight against 
terrorism and the EU's attempt to secure its outside borders. 
 In light of the lack of a response from the GoG, XXXXXXXXXXXX
expressed a desire for more assistance from the USG and the 
EU in addressing these concerns.  He also indicated that the 
 
ATHENS 00001652  002 OF 002 
 
 
large Pakistani community in Greece and these security 
threats to Pakistan might be reasons for the GoP to increase 
the size of its post in Athens in the near future. 
 
¶6.  (C)  COMMENT:  While reports of corruption or 
indifference among Greek law enforcement authorities are not 
rare, they are not typically made as explicitly as here. 
XXXXXXXXXXXX's contention that money involved in human smuggling 
is possibly used to fund extremist or even terrorist groups 
in Pakistan is also a charge we have not heard communicated 
so emphatically before.  We will remain alert to such reports 
in our contact with Greek law enforcement.
