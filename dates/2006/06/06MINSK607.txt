¶1. On June 9, Econoff delivered reftel Iran information to Igor 
Ugorich, Counselor in the MFA's Department of International 
Security and Arms Control.  Ugorich did not provide any substantive 
response. 
 
¶2. Comment: Post does not expect the GOB will issue any statements 
even slightly critical of Iran, or even attempt to quietly speak 
with Iran on this issue.  Publicly, the GOB has repeatedly made 
statements in favor of Iran's nuclear program.
