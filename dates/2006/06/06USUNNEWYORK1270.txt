SUBJECT: LOOTED IRAQI STATUE? 
 
 
¶1.  USUN has received a June 21 diplomatic note (text in para 
2 below) from the Iraqi Mission to the UN requesting USG 
assistance in returning a statue reportedly looted from the 
Iraqi Museum.  As the note refers to information provided by 
AmEmbassy Baghdad, perhaps action is already underway.  USUN 
requests guidance on how to reply to the Iraqi Mission. 
 
¶2.  Begin text of note: (Complimentary salutation) and has 
the honor to inform that the Embassy of the United States in 
Baghdad has informed Iraqi authorities that the United States 
customs authority of New York State (sic) found a statue of 
the Sumerian king, named An Ti Mi Na, which has been looted 
after the collapse of the previous Iraqi regime from the 
Sumerian Hall of the Iraqi Museum. 
 
The Permanent Mission of Iraq has further the honor to 
request for assistance from the United States authorities to 
ensure the return of this statue to the Iraqi Museum. 
(complimentary close) End text.
