SUBJECT: FINLAND RESPONSE TO SUPPORT FOR NICARAGUAN 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS 
 
REF: STATE 96360 
 
(U) In response to subject demarche, MFA Counselor for Latin 
America Anu Lager- 
Velthein informed PolChief June 21 that the GOF shares our 
concerns about democracy 
in Nicaragua and strongly supports an EU observer mission for 
the upcoming election. 
Numbers have not yet been determined, but Lager-Velthein 
estimated that the GOF 
would fund as many as 6 to 8 Finnish observers, depending on 
the EU observer mission's 
needs.  Finland maintains a bilateral Embassy in Managua, and 
Nicaragua is one of eight 
priority countries for GOF development assistance.  As such, 
she said, Finland will not 
provide bilateral support for an OAS observer mission, but 
will continue its bilateral 
support to various NGOS, in addition to funding EU observers.
