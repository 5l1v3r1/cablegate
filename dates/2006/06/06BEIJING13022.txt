Possible DPRK Missile Launch 
---------------------------- 
 
¶2.  Jiang Yu was evasive whn pressed during the regular June 
20 MFA press briefing about China's reaction and expected 
response to reports of an impending missile launch by the 
DPRK.  Jiang stated only that China had "taken note" of such 
reports.  The Six-Party Talks are encountering difficulties 
and China hopes for an early resumption of the talks, she 
said.  China is working to press ahead with the talks and 
maintains close communications with relevant parties, she 
asserted. 
 
Sino-African Relations and Energy Development 
--------------------------------------------- 
¶3.  China will send an official delegation to the African 
Union Summit (AUS) in July, Jiang answered when asked if 
China planned to attend.  China has historically supported 
the AUS and considers the AUS the most representative 
regional organization in Africa.  The AUS plays a major role 
in safeguarding African peace and stability, Jiang stated. 
 
¶4.  Asked by the Bloomberg reporter whether Premier Wen 
Jiabao's current African trip was targeted primarily towards 
energy development, Jiang stated that the Premier's visit 
focused on all of Africa.  China hopes to consolidate its 
relations and expand development towards Africa under a "new 
type of strategic partnership", she said.  Queried 
specifically about energy deals with Angola and the Congo, 
Jiang stated that China and Angola will sign a series of 
treaties involving law enforcement and economics.  China's 
energy policy is designed to ensure self reliance, Jiang 
stated.  China's oil consumption is one eighth that of the 
United States and China's level of oil reliance is much lower 
than that of developed countries, Jiang stressed.  China's 
crude oil imports are limited and China's overall oil 
consumption is only 8 percent of the world total.  China 
seeks to develop an energy policy based on mutually 
beneficial exchanges and relations, Jiang added. 
 
Sino-Saudi Arabian Oil Deals 
---------------------------- 
 
¶5.  Sino-Saudi Arabian cooperation on energy development has 
 
BEIJING 00013022  002 OF 003 
 
 
its own unique advantages, Jiang said, when asked if China 
was close to signing an oil agreement with Saudi Arabia. 
China will continue to cooperate with Saudi Arabia in order 
to improve China's mechanism to enhance its strategic oil 
reserves, Jiang said. 
 
China and the Upcoming G-8 Summit 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  President Hu will attend the G-8's dialogue with 
developing countries during July's G-8 Summit in Russia, 
Jiang said when asked if China wanted to join the G-8.  The 
main theme of the dialogue meeting will be energy security 
and African development, she stated.  China's relations with 
the G-8 will also be discussed.  The G-8 plays an important 
role in international political and economic affairs, Jiang 
said, and although China is still a developing nation, China 
believes developed nations should partner with developing 
countries to meet global challenges.  China stands ready to 
enhance G-8 dialogue and cooperation, Jiang stated. 
 
Deputy Secretary Zoellick 
------------------------- 
 
¶7.  China appreciates former Deputy Secretary of State 
Zoellick's role in furthering Sino-U.S. relations, Jiang said 
when asked to comment on Zoellick's resignation.  Zoellick 
enhanced mutual trust during two rounds of Strategic Dialogue 
and China hopes that Zoellick's successor will continue this 
trend. 
 
Valiant Shield 
-------------- 
 
¶8.  China actively participates in military-to-military 
exchanges in order to enhance mutual trust and cooperation, 
Jiang stated, when asked what Sino-U.S. cooperation during 
upcoming Valiant Shield exercises meant for military 
relations between China and the United States. 
 
Three Gorges Dam Activist Assaulted 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶9.  German reporters demanded to know what China's response 
was to the serious injuries sustained at the hands of Public 
Security Bureau officials by Three Gorges Dam activist Fu 
Xiancai and whether his injuries were sustained as a result 
of being interviewed by a German news program.  German 
reporters asked for China's response to intervention in the 
case by the German Embassy who had sent both a political 
officer and a doctor to oversee and assist with Fu's care. 
Jiang responded by asserting that Fu's medical treatment 
should not be interfered with and that a task force was 
investigating the matter in accordance with law. 
 
Sino-Vatican Relations 
--------------------- 
 
¶10.  China is ready for dialogue with the Vatican, said Jiang 
when asked if Beijing and the Vatican were currently engaged 
in dialogue to ease strained relations. 
 
The Next UN Secretary General 
----------------------------- 
 
¶11.  China supports an Asian Secretary General to succeed 
current UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, Jiang stated, when 
asked who China would like to see as Annan's successor.  The 
selection will require full deliberation by all parties, but 
Asian nations should be represented, Jiang stated. 
 
¶12.  On June 19 Afghan President Karzai met with President Hu 
Jintao, Jiang said.  They signed treaties designed to 
strengthen anti-terrorism and anti-drug cooperation, Jiang 
stated, when asked if anti-terrorism was the primary focus of 
the Sino-Afghan meeting.  China respects and supports 
Afghanistan's efforts to maintain national stability and push 
forward its reconstruction, she said.
