¶1.  SUMMARY: Israeli President Moshe Katzav paid a two-day 
state visit to Bulgaria on June 11-12 that focused on 
promoting political dialogue, intensifying trade and 
economic contacts and encouraging investments in Bulgaria. 
News reports quote Katzav characterizing the visit as "very 
successful" and "extremely productive".  The two presidents 
signed a visa waiver agreement.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  Katzav and Bulgarian President Parvanov opened on June 
12 a Bulgarian-Israeli business forum with the participation 
of 80 Bulgarian companies and 15 Israeli companies working 
in the areas of construction, real estate, 
telecommunications, high-tech, marketing and consultancy 
services.  According to Parvanov, agriculture, food 
processing, tourism, and defense are traditional areas for 
Bulgarian-Israeli commercial relations, but there are 
opportunities for intensification of trade and investment. 
Katzav called upon businessmen to establish contacts and 
invest, pointing out that there was a very considerable 
niche for development in information technology. 
 
¶3.  During the visit, Bulgarian Deputy Foreign Minister Feim 
Chaushev and Israeli Ambassador to Sofia Avraham Sharon 
signed a Visa Waiver Agreement that is expected to come into 
force within six months.  Under the accord, Bulgarians will 
be able to travel without visas for a stay of up to 90 days 
in Israel.  Last year 103,523 Israeli citizens visited 
Bulgaria, ranking Israel 11th in terms of  visitors to 
Bulgaria.  A total of 11,404 Bulgarians visited Israel, 
ranking it 22nd in terms of destinations preferred by 
Bulgarians. 
 
¶4.  This was the second visit to Bulgaria by an Israeli head 
of State since 1991, when President Haim Herzog visited 
Sofia.  Katzav met also Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev and 
parliamentary speaker Georgi Pirinski.  The Bulgarian Jewish 
community greeted him in its Synagogue in downtown Sofia, 
where he was met by Emil Kalo, Chairman of the Shalom 
organization Bulgaria.
