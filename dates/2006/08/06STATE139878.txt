Classified By: WHA/FO DOUG BARNES FOR REASONS 1.5 b and d 
 
¶1.  (U)  This is an action request.  Please see para 3. 
 
¶2.  (C) Department understands the Colombian government has 
approached the GOB regarding the July 14 decision by the 
Brazilian National Committee on Refugees (CONARE) to grant 
political asylum to Francisco Antonio Cadena Collazos (ref 
B).  The Department shares Post's and the GOC's concerns 
regarding CONARE's actions and the likely ratification of 
CONARE's decision by the Brazilian Supreme Federal Tribunal 
(STF).  Despite GOB claims it cannot interfere with the 
judicial process surrounding Cadena's asylum claim, 
Department agrees it is important to request more 
information, express our concern, and reinforce the message 
by the Colombians that the decision should be reversed. 
 
¶3.  (U) Post is requested to approach the GOB at the 
appropriate level to raise USG concern on the issue. Post may 
draw on the below talking points: 
 
  --  We are concerned about the July 14 decision by CONARE 
to grant political asylum to suspected FARC terrorist 
Francisco Antonio Cadena Collazos.  We understand it is 
likely the STF will shortly rule on the CONARE decision. 
 
-- As you are aware, Cadena is wanted in Colombia on charges 
of murder for terrorist purposes, extortion, and terrorism. 
In these circumstances, we find it surprising Brazil would 
offer political asylum to Cadena. 
 
-- We would appreciate further information regarding the 
basis for the decision and how it can be reconciled with the 
GOB's obligation to deny safe haven to terrorists and to 
bring to justice (e.g., extradite or prosecute) terrorists 
found in their territory.  This obligatin is consistent with 
Security Council resolution 1373, which calls on states 
ensure that those who commit or support terrorist acts are 
brought to justice. 
 
-- We strongly urge the GOB to ensure the STF's review of the 
CONARE decision is fair and takes into account the above 
considerations. 
 
-- We also urge you to engage further with the Colombian 
government on this issue.
