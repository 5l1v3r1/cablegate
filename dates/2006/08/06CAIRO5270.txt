Classified By: Ambassador Francis J. Ricciardone for reasons 1.4 (b) an
d (d).

¶1. (S) Ref B and previous messages report our campaign
against Al Manar on NileSat over the past year. When
circumstances permit, we will resume our advocacy with every
influential top official. Further discussion with the GOE at
this time regarding removing Al Manar broadcasts from NileSat
would not get the result we want. DCM discussed the issue on
August 20 with Assistant Foreign Minister for American
Affairs Salama Shaker, who stressed that "now is a
particularly bad time to raise Al Manar." In the
post-Lebanon political context, the Egyptians believe any
move against Al Manar will backfire and strengthen the
nascent appeal of Hassan Nasrallah and Hezbollah.
