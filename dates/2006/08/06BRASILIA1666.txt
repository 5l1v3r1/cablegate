SUBJECT: BRAZIL TO SEND PARK DIRECTORS ON PAID INTERNSHIPS 
 
 
¶1. Post recently learned that Brazil's Environmental Protection 
Agency (IBAMA) has allotted money for the second semester of FY07 to 
send each of its 23 national park directors on a month-long 
internship at a national park overseas.  At a meeting on August 10, 
IBAMA's head of international relations and director of wildlife 
expressed interest in sending some of the park directors to intern 
at a national park in the United States.  Similar agreements already 
exist with France and Italy. 
 
¶2. Comment: Post regards this as a visible, high-impact opportunity 
to increase collaboration and build capacity in Brazil.  As IBAMA 
has already budgeted money for the program the U.S. only requires a 
national park willing to help train and develop a Brazilian 
counterpart.  This is the equivalent of a long-term IV paid for by 
the GoB.  Post highlights that undertaking the endeavor would result 
in a very positive outcome, from both a conservation and public 
relations perspective.  Likely follow-ups include roundtables, 
speeches and/or press events.  End Comment 
 
¶3. Action Request: Post requests Department and NPS guidance on the 
viability of the project.
