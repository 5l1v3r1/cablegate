In Today's Papers 
 
Turkey's Final Decision to Come After Gul's Visit to Syria 
All papers report that Turkish military and government leaders 
discussed Turkey's possible contribution to the peacekeeping force 
in Lebanon in detail at yesterday's National Security Council (NSC) 
meeting.  In its brief written statement following the meeting, the 
NSC did not announce a decision on Turkey's contribution but praised 
and expressed support for UNSC Resolution 1701.  Milliyet and 
Hurriyet report that during his one day visit to Syria today, FM Gul 
will urge Syria to stop its support for Hezbollah.  Gul will also 
pass on the conditions under which Turkey will send troops to 
Lebanon.  Milliyet and Cumhuriyet report that Gul may visit Tehran 
in the coming days to deliver messages similar to those he is 
expected to deliver in Syria. 
 
Columnist Okay Gonensin, writing in the mass appeal Vatan, believes 
that the US is using Turkey's participation in the peacekeeping 
forces as a bargaining chip for action against the PKK:  "Expressed 
through diplomacy, Turkey is receiving a message from the US 
administration which can be translated as 'Turkey should make a 
stronger commitment in the Middle East so that it can enjoy a better 
result in the fight against PKK.'  The truth is that Turkey will 
find itself in a very difficult situation if and when it becomes one 
of the sides in the Middle East dispute.  And this could happen in 
an instant if a Turkish soldier is killed during the southern 
Lebanon peacekeeping force operations.  At this point we don't know 
exactly what the US has been asking from Turkey in exchange for the 
PKK card.  It won't be surprising though if every demand contains 
potential risks for Turkey's future." 
 
Fehmi Koru commenting in Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak argues for a 
broader regional role for Turkey: "The Turkish government is still 
wavering on the issue of sending troops to Lebanon.  The hesitation 
stems from very understandable reasons -- Lebanon is not like 
Bosnia, Kosovo or Afghanistan.  Assuming duties in Lebanon puts 
Turkey directly into the Middle East balance, which also means 
Turkey will come face-to-face with every problem there. Turkey's 
role should be in the bigger picture not in a particular one.  It 
would be better for us to show interest in the entire set of issues 
on a regional scale rather than being enthusiastic about fixing 
imbalances created by others." 
 
Commenting in mainstream Milliyet, Fikret Bila warns that "a lasting 
peace in Lebanon directly depends on a lasting peace in Palestine": 
"Developments regarding the Palestine issue will have a direct 
impact on the success of the ceasefire and peacekeeping efforts in 
southern Lebanon.  Any operation by Israel in Gaza and the West Bank 
areas or any acts by Hezbollah will put the peacekeepers in a very 
difficult situation.  A lasting peace in Lebanon directly depends on 
a lasting peace in Palestine.  Ankara is very much aware of this 
fact and expects to see a similar interpretation of this situation 
by neighboring countries.  Otherwise, peacekeepers, including 
Turkish soldiers, will be taking a big risk and there will be no 
peace in Lebanon." 
 
President Bush Comments on Additional UN Resolution 
Sabah, Radikal and Vatan:  At a press conference in Washington 
yesterday President Bush said that "the need for an international 
force in Lebanon is urgent" and urged the international community to 
respond to calls for deployment as soon as possible.  Vatan reports 
that the US has decided to send $230 Million to Lebanon.  President 
Bush added that "the US is considering an additional UN resolution 
to clarify the mandate of the UN peacekeepers in Lebanon." 
 
Forest Fires 
All papers:  As firefighters and forest fire teams worked hard to 
extinguish fires in 20 different places in the Aegean and

Mediterranean yesterday, new fires broke out yesterday in Bodrum, 
Antalya and Adana.  Three hundred hectares of forestry have been 
destroyed by fire in three different locations of Antalya, and the 
Mugla provincial forestry directorate claimed that 500 hectares of 
forestry were destroyed in the region.  According to the Forestry 
Ministry statistics, nearly 2500 hectares of forestry was destroyed 
by fire in 447 incidents in the first eight months of this year.
