Â¶1. (SBU) The U.S. and France continue to work intensively and 
urgently in New York and in capitals to reach agreement on a 
draft UNSC resolution calling for a full cessation of 
hostilities between Lebanon and Israel.  Ambassador Bolton 
and French Permanent Representative de la Sabliere met again 
August 9 with the visiting ministers comprising the Arab 
League Troika (the Foreign Ministers of Qatar and the United 
Arab Emirates as well as the Secretary-General of the Arab 
League) and engaged in constructive discussions on how to 
address the conflict and in particular how to build on the 
August 7 decision by the Government of Lebanon to deploy its 
forces to the south of Lebanon.  Following these 
consultations, the American and French ambassadors met with 
the other P-5 members of the Security Council.  More meetings 
are scheduled for August 10, including an additional 
bilateral with France followed by another meeting of the P-5. 
 As the negotiations continue to move forward at a rapid 
pace, we recommend posts draw on the latest statements by 
senior USG officials to supplement this brief update.
