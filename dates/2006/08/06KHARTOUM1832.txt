¶1. (SBU) CG spoke with a journalist presently in Nbanga, a Sudanese 
village south of Maridi near the border with the Democratic Republic 
of Congo.  The journalist said that Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) 
leader Joseph Kony has been in Nbanga for several days.  The 
journalist thought that Kony had seen his mother and reported that 
yesterday Kony met with four of his wives who had arrived from 
Uganda.  The local SPLM Commissioner initially sought to block the 
meeting unless the LRA returned six women abducted from the area in 
LRA raids before the peace talks began, but Police and Security 
Commissioner Daniel Awet intervened to ensure that Kony saw his 
wives. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The journalist said that Kony is scheduled to meet a 
delegation of Acholi elders and church and civil society leaders 
from Northern Uganda on July 29.  The source did not know if there 
had been any contact between LRA leaders and Ugandan Consul General 
Busho. Busho did not return to the Ugandan delegation so that he 
could travel to Nbanga with Government of southern Sudan Vice 
President Riak Machar.  CG will seek out Busho when the latter 
returns to Juba on July 30.
