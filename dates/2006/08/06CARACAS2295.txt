Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (U)  On July 19, the Economic Section held an Avian 
Influenza Seminar in the Embassy, which drew over 20 
participants from the poultry processing sector and the 
Ministry of Agriculture (MAT).  The Seminar provided a forum 
to better understand the BRV's plans for Avian Influenza as 
well as to highlight the private sector's concerns.  So far, 
the BRV has drafted a "procedure manual" based on FAO 
standards (not yet made public) and is looking to reach out 
to the private poultry producers, who were mostly unaware 
that the BRV had any preparations at all.  Producers were 
especially concerned about biosecurity and compensation in 
the event of an outbreak.  Post has set up an AI listserve 
and is looking to hold DVCs with experts as part of an 
ongoing outreach strategy.  In addition, Post sent the MAT 
Animal Health Coordinator to the U.S. on a Voluntary Visitor 
(VolVis) program in April, and held an Embassy AI Emergency 
Action Subcommittee meeting in May.  End Summary.

Video sparks talk about AI plans 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U)  The Econ section coordinated an Avian Influenza 
Seminar on July 19.  Turnout was suprisingly high, and over 
20 participants from the poultry industry (including 
pro-government companies and one Brazilian industry 
representative) and the Ministry of Agriculture's Animal 
Health Inspection Service (SASA) attended.  Post 
participation included the Environmental Hub Officer and 
personnel from the Health Unit, American Citizen Services 
(ACS), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), 
and Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS). 
 
¶3.  (U)  The Seminar began with an edited version of the 
video "Killer Flu" (produced by State), which highlighted 
some human health aspects of AI, showed how animal health 
authorities in Vietnam dealt with an outbreak, and touched on 
cultural barriers to eradication of the disease.  The 
participants used it as a platform to begin a lively 
discussion on Avian Influenza in Venezuela.  Aimara Flores, 
SASA's AI coordinator, began by acknowledging that her 
organization was aware of the problem, and that the BRV had 
already taken steps to ban Colombian poultry imports based on 
an outbreak of low-path AI (Note: The 2005 poultry ban lifted 
 
CARACAS 00002295  002.2 OF 005 
 
 
on July 31. End Note) She also noted that some of the 
cultural preferences of Vietnam (such as eating raw duck 
blood soup) make that country more prone to the disease. 
Noting that the video was somewhat alarmist, Flores said that 
Venezuela was at low risk for H5N1 Avian Flu, and that the 
WHO has not confirmed human-to-human transmission.

BRV Avian Flu Plan 
------------------ 
 
¶4. (U)  Flores announced that the BRV had already formed an 
AI commission (with joint participation from the government 
and the private sector), which has drafted a "procedure 
manual" based on an FAO AI plan.  She said the manual would 
be out soon, but that the Ministry of Agriculture (MAT) had 
yet to approve SASA's budget for the project.  Later in the 
discussion, she criticized that the BRV's funding was being 
directed solely at the Ministry of Health (MSDS), and that it 
should be going to MAT, as AI is an animal health problem 
before it's a human health issue. 
 
¶5. (U)  Flores said that SASA has held over 6 seminars this 
year alone, and ran a 40-person simulation involving 
government agencies, including Ministries of Health, 
Agriculture, Labor and Defense, as well as the customs and 
tax agency (SENIAT), the National Hygiene Institute and the 
National Institute for Agricultural Research (INIA).  Flores 
also announced another simulation in September, which will 
include the private sector.  SASA representatives noted that 
they would like to unify diagnostic criteria to make it 
routine and consecutive.  The invitee from the Ministry of 
Health did not attend the seminar, but SASA representatives 
said that the MSDS has a supply of Tamiflu (unknown amount), 
but has had problems obtaining protective gear. 
 
¶6. (U)  A representative from Post's ACS section asked SASA 
how the BRV planned to inform the public about the risks of 
Avian Flu.  SASA responded that they are preparing public 
campaigns that center around food hygiene and general best 
practices (once the funding comes through).  The Brazilian 
poultry sector representative highlighted that actual deaths 
from H5N1 Avian Flu were very few, and that waging an 
alarmist public campaign would do more harm than good.  The 
Ministry of Health has opened a hotline to report suspicious 
cases, though mass advertising is also pending budget 
approval.

Concerns from the poultry industry 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (U)  According to participants, per capita chicken 
 
CARACAS 00002295  003.2 OF 005 
 
 
production is higher in Venezuela than in some of the world's 
largest exporters, such as neighboring Brazil.  A Venezuelan 
poultry producer expressed concern about the "aves de 
traspatio" (free-range birds, i.e. not in coops), and how 
they often come in contact with commercial poultry despite 
biosecurity of facilities.  He said this was the Achilles 
heel in production (despite biosecurity efforts), and AI 
could easily propagate via these birds.  SASA did not comment 
directly, other than to acknowledge that this was indeed a 
weakness. 
 
¶8. (U)  Another poultry producer asked about SASA's plans for 
monitoring and testing (presumably for commercial fowl). 
SASA answered that they have three migratory bird testing 
points, and hope to increase this with more funding (they did 
not mention testing of commercial poultry).  They plan on 
testing over 54,000 birds nationwide, focusing on high-risk 
areas, to determine if they are free of AI. 
 
¶9. (U)  Many participants asked about compensation in the 
event of an AI outbreak and SASA-mandated extermination of 
commercial poultry.  One poultry farmer said that unless 
there was government compensation, he could theoretically 
bury the dead chickens and sell the live ones, and no one 
would know.  Other participants discussed that compensation 
was needed, otherwise there would be an economic incentive to 
hide outbreaks.  Flores assured the producers that 
compensation was part of the BRV "procedure manual" and that 
it would be part of the AI policy.

Post Outreach 
------------- 
 
¶10. (U) During the seminar, post's APHIS representative told 
the group about upcoming diagnostics training in Colombia and 
the existence of two authorized molecular diagnostics testing 
labs for South America, explaining that the labs will require 
a trained individual to package the samples.  Econoff asked 
for feedback regarding future events, and participants 
expressed interest in a DVC with avian flu experts and/or 
representatives from the U.S. poultry industry.  All 
participants responded positively to the idea of an AI 
listserve for future communications.  The listserve was 
created on Jul 26, and Econoff has been sending relevant 
information, such as Spanish-language AI links and articles. 
 
----------------- 
AI VolVis Program 
----------------- 
 
¶11. (U) In April, the Econ Section nominated Gloria 
Hernandez, Animal Health Coordinator for SASA, to participate 
 
CARACAS 00002295  004.2 OF 005 
 
 
in a regional Avian Influenza VolVis Program.  (Note: Aimara 
Flores was also set to participate, but for health reasons 
was not able to go.  End Note).  Funding for the airfare was 
provided by FAS.  Hernandez traveled to Washington DC, 
Atlanta, and Miami and met with a series of USG agencies 
(including CDC, DHS, and DOD) along with a group of animal 
and human health officials from South America.  The visitor 
program received positive reviews from all participants, and 
provided a forum to share experiences and learn about U.S. 
preparedness for an Avian Flu outbreak.  As of June, 
Hernandez changed positions within SASA and was named 
Director of Zoosanitary Control.

Post AI Task Force 
------------------ 
 
¶12. (SBU)  On May 25, Post's AI Emergency Action Subcommittee 
convened.  The group is comprised of the Deputy Chief of 
Mission, Economic Counselor, the Defense Attache, the 
Management Counselor, Post's Avian Flu Coordinator (EconOff), 
and personnel from the Health Unit, the Regional Security 
Office (RSO), ACS, and APHIS.  The group discussed pending 
items from preparedness checklist.  Regarding linkage with 
local government health officials, Post's physician said he 
had no formal contacts, but the APHIS representative said 
that he has regular dialogue SASA and the Pan-American Health 
Organization.  RSO has discussed facilities access plans, and 
is in the process of drafting a plan, but requested any 
available guidance.  The Health Unit has pre-ordered 200 
regular flu shots and has over 3,000 Tamiflu doses, as well 
as protective equipment.

Comment 
------- 
 
¶13. (SBU)  The Avian Influenza Seminar was a success.  It 
opened an animated discussion and opened a forum for dialogue 
between the private sector and the government -- a task often 
difficult to accomplish with the BRV.  One poultry producer 
told Econoff separately that he found the event very useful, 
as he thought the BRV had no plan whatsoever on AI.  The 
success of the event hints at the lack of prior linkage 
between the two groups.  The next step is that contacts made 
between participants provide an opportunity to bridge that 
gap.  Though an H5N1 AI outbreak seems highly unlikely at the 
present time, both the Embassy and the BRV are making 
preparations.  The BRV is publicly silent on their AI plan, 
and has some preparedness implementation issues (mostly 
budgetary), but they are aware of the problem.  Post received 
a draft SASA avian influenza contingency plan which we are 
reviewing; however, it does not yet have BRV interagency 
 
CARACAS 00002295  005.2 OF 005 
 
 
approval.  The Econ Section will continue to reach out the AI 
"community" in order to facilitate dialogue and carry on with 
contingency preparations for an H5N1 outbreak in Venezuela. 
End Comment.
