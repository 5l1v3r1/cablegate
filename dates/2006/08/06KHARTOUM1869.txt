SUBJECT:  UPDATE ON S/CRS SUPPORT TO U.S. EFFORTS AT DPA 
IMPLEMENTATION 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request - see para 5. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Embassy Khartoum commends S/CRS officers' efforts in 
supporting and providing direct assistance to facilitate the 
implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA).  S/CRS and 
Active Response Corps (ARC) officers deployed to Khartoum and Darfur 
have increased the Embassy's capacity significantly to coordinate 
with DPA signatories and target audiences, establish DPA 
implementation offices in both Khartoum and El Fasher, and conduct 
field analysis and reporting on the situation in Darfur.  By 
developing a foundation for a long-term Embassy presence in Darfur, 
they have provided sustained and timely communications between key 
actors in the field and the Embassy. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Since the May 5 signing of the DPA, S/CRS, in close 
coordination with POL, MGT, RSO, and USAID elements at the Embassy, 
has taken a number of concrete steps to support Embassy Khartoum and 
facilitate DPA implementation by contributing human, financial, and 
technical resources.  These have included the following: 
 
-- preparing DPA implementation offices in both Khartoum and El 
Fasher to provide the African Union and DPA signatories with 
furnished space for offices, workshops and seminars, public events, 
and other meetings in support of the DPA; 
 
-- coordinating closely with the African Union to augment its 
capacity to staff, program, and provide other resources to support 
the DPA; 
 
-- facilitating discussions between DPA stakeholders and assisting 
in developing donor strategies; 
 
-- influencing tribal and IDP leadership in a nascent DPA 
information campaign in North Darfur; 
 
-- developing the modalities of a new and more effective Ceasefire 
Commission and representing the USG at Joint Commission meetings; 
and, 
 
-- providing security advice regarding DPA obligations to SLM Minni 
Manawi and coordinating his visit to Washington. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The situation in Darfur remains fragile, and much work 
remains to be done if the DPA is to be successful in providing a 
platform for a sustainable peace that can lead to IDP returns and 
economic development for the region.  Continued S/CRS support can 
provide the Embassy with valuable assistance. 
 
¶5. (SBU) ACTION REQUESTED:  Embassy requests S/CRS support the 
mission by providing personnel for the following positions for a 
minimum of 90 days as of September 1, with an option to extend, 
depending on Embassy assessment: 
 
-- Pol/Mil Security Advisor to provide assistance to SLM/A signatory 
Minni Minawi and the African Union, furnish advice in implementing 
DPA security arrangements, and coordinate disarmament, 
demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) planning and activities 
(vice Wilson); and, 
 
-- One political officer to maintain liaison with the African Union, 
DPA signatories, and others; monitor DPA implementation and the 
management of the DPA Implementation Office in El Fasher; and, 
conduct analysis and reporting on related topics. 
 
 
¶6. (SBU) Embassy Khartoum thanks S/CRS for its support and looks 
forward to continued cooperation.  This new Department of State 
surge capacity has proven useful to us, and has contributed to our 
efforts to implement a complicated, but critical, peace agreement. 
The Embassy is prepared to assist in facilitating visas and 
providing administrative support for incoming S/CRS officers.  Point 
of contact for the Embassy and supervisor for the S/CRS team in 
Khartoum is Pol/Econ Counselor Eric Whitaker.
