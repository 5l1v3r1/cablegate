¶1.  Summary.  Financial analysts view the campaign to force 
President Chen Shui-bian to resign as a primary cause of the August 
22 stock index plunge of 3.2% in the Taiwan stock index.  Local 
institutional investors who are more concerned over political unrest 
than their foreign counterparts sold stocks, while foreign portfolio 
investors registered net stock purchases, viewing the drop as 
temporary and a good buying opportunity.  End Summary. 
 
Campaign to Overthrow President Chen 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  Former DPP Party Chairman Shih Ming-te is leading a campaign to 
force President Chen Shui-bian to resign.  Shih will organize a 
large-scale sit-in in front of the Presidential Office which may 
prevent the President's office from normal functioning.  This 
campaign, together with the PRC (Taiwan's main trading partner) 
unexpectedly raising interest rates by 0.27 percentage points on 
August 18, roiled Taiwan's financial markets on August 21, a Senior 
Market Analyst at Merrill Lynch told AIT. 
 
Stock Market Plunges 
-------------------- 
 
¶3.  The Analyst explained that local portfolio investors' fear that 
demonstrations may lead to violent political unrest prompted 
Taiwan's stock price index to plunge 3.2% to close August 21 at 
6,420.01 points.  The share prices of 92% of the 1,164 listed 
companies declined.  Seventy-two companies saw their share prices 
hit the daily limit of 7% decline.   The 3.2% fall in Taiwan's share 
price index, the fourth deepest drop so far this year in Taiwan, was 
far more than the stock price declines of other Asian markets (1.86% 
in Hong Kong, 0.85% in Tokyo, 0.71% in Seoul, and 0.65% in 
Singapore). 
 
NTD Depreciates against USD 
--------------------------- 
 
¶4.  The NTD depreciated 0.07% to close August 21 at NT$32.69 per 
USD, against the trend of other currencies in East Asia which gained 
strength against the USD.  The Japanese Yen appreciated 0.5% and the 
Korean Won and the Singaporean Dollar appreciated 0.2%.  The Hong 
Kong Dollar depreciated 0.01% against the USD. 
 
Foreign Investors See Unrest as Buying Opportunity 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶5.  On August 21, local institutional investors who are more 
sensitive to political unrest than foreign investors sold NT$3.55 
billion (US$109 million) more stocks than they bought.  In contrast, 
foreign portfolio investors made net stock purchases of NT$1.88 
billion (US$57.8 million), sending their net stock purchases so far 
in August to NT$45.9 billion (US$1.4 billion).  Stock market 
analysts of Morgan Stanley, Citibank, and Chase believe that the 
financial impact of the campaign against the President will be 
short-lived and that excess liquidity will eventually drive stock 
prices up again.  A Citibank email of August 22 advised "we believe 
political turmoil and angry mobs are a Buy indicator in Taiwan." 
However, the Merrill Lynch analyst predicted further declines, 
perhaps down to 6300, may be in store in the run-up to the December 
mayoral elections in Taipei and Kaohsiung.  Most analysts believe 
that Taiwan's stock prices will rebound in the next few days.  (The 
stock price index rose 84 points to close August 22 6,590 points.)
