SUBJECT: IBAMA ANNOUNCES NEW, TAMPER-FREE FOREST PRODUCT MONITORING 
SYSTEM 
 
REFTEL: BRASILIA 1651 
 
¶1. Summary: Ibama (Brazilian Environmental Protection Agency) 
officially published a normative instruction on August 23, creating 
a new system of Forest Origin Documents (DOF) to track Brazilian 
timber and timber derived products.  The new system takes effect 
September 1 and aims to combat illegal deforestation by enforcing 
stricter control over the movement and storage of forest products. 
DOFs will replace the highly contentious and notoriously corrupt 
system of paper ATPFs (Forest Product Transport Authorizations) that 
have been the backbone of at least 10 separate schemes to illegally 
harvest and market illegal timber (reftel). End Summary 
 
¶2. As of September 1 of this year a Forest Origin Document 
(containing specific information about a product's origin, volume 
and type) must accompany any forest product stored or transported in 
Brazil.  Among the myriad of products requiring documentation are 
logs, sawed wood, piles, stakes, lumber, coal (derived from wood), 
xaxim, hearts of palm and wood product residues.  These DOFs will 
replace Ibama's ATPFs, a monitoring system historically rife with 
graft and corruption.  In fact, Ibama in conjunction with Brazil's 
Federal Police, have executed 10 sting operations over the past 
three years to break up illegal logging rings.  In each of these 
cases, the lumber gangs utilized illicit ATPFs to circumvent 
enforcement mechanisms and to illegally sell timber. 
 
¶3. In order to avoid the ATPF pitfall, Ibama authorities have 
centralized the new system and incorporated a number of features to 
stamp out corruption.  Unlike ATPFs, handwritten, processed and 
distributed by individuals in Ibama offices, Ibama will generate and 
enforce DOFs from centralized computer system.  To obtain a DOF an 
entrepreneur will access a website from where he/she can print off 
the document.  However, to access the system the individual or 
entity must be enrolled in Brazil's Federal Technical Register after 
proving that he/she has been a part of any environmental 
crime/irregularity.  Once in the system, the DOF is only emitted if 
the product proves consistent with the holding's forest management 
plan.  Any product registered on the system must come from titled, 
registered land containing a management plan for deforestation.  As 
Ibama is responsible for approving all management plans they are 
also aware of the amount of wood that can be taken from any given 
area.  If data is inconsistent, the system will not emit the 
document of origin.  DOFs will also expire after substantially 
shorter periods of time than ATPFs, which are valid for up to 90 
days.  Henceforth, a DOF for products transported in-state is valid 
for 5 days, 10 days for interstate travel and a maximum of 30 days 
for logs transported by barge.  Finally, Ibama claims the document 
will be far more difficult to forge. 
 
¶4. Interestingly, backlash from loggers accustomed to 
business-as-usual practices is already being felt in the field. 
Ibama stopped issuing ATPFs some 40 days ago, although the DOF 
system has yet to come online.  Subsequently, the local manager of 
Ibama's office in Santarem, in the state of Para, resigned today 
bowing to pressure from the association of timber processing 
industries, whose members have been unable to extract or transport 
timber for over six weeks. 
 
¶5. Comment: After nearly two years of waiting, the new system for 
monitoring the movement of forest products is finally ready. 
Patching up many of the holes that bred corruption with ATPFs, the 
new DOFs appear, on paper, to have a legitimate chance of working. 
For Ibama and the federal police the key issue now is implementation 
and enforcement.  Apprehending illegal forest products and actually 
keeping them off the roads will remain Ibama and the Federal 
Police's biggest challenge. End Comment
