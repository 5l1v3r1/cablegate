(C) As requested reftel, on August 2, Poloff met with Inga 
Poldma, Acting MFA Director 
for Asia Affairs, to express the USG's surprise and 
disappointment in the EU's invitation 
to the Burmese Foreign Minister to attend the upcoming ASEM 
Summit in Helsinki. 
Poldma vigorously defended the Finns, noting that the 
invitation predated the Finnish 
Presidency, and was therefore not a Finnish Presidency 
decision but one agreed upon by 
all EU members on June 19.  Furthermore, she defended the 
EU's actions by saying that 
"it is better to have the Burmese present in Helsinki so that 
a constructive dialogue is 
possible."  She added that Burma's invitation has broad 
support within the EU.  When 
pressed why an invitation was not issued for a lower level 
Burmese participant, Poldma 
was only able to answer that if the matter becomes more 
controversial, the EU has 
mechanisms in place to reconsider the Burmese Foreign 
Minister's participation.
