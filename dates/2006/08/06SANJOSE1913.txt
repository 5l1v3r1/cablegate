(SBU) Post delivered ref A points to Carlos Cordero, Deputy 
Director for Multilateral Policy at the MFA, on 1 August 
¶2006.  On August 18, Poloffs followed up with Cordero who 
said that Costa Rica supports all international efforts to 
prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.  Cordero pointed 
to Foreign Minister Stagno's public statement of June 1, 2006 
calling for Iran to halt enrichment of uranium (ref B).  On 
August 24, PolCouns raised the issue with Jose Joaquin 
Chaverri, Director for Foreign Policy at the MFA.  Chaverri 
advised that Costa Rica has not taken a formal position on 
this specific issue, but restated Costa Rica's long-standing 
opposition to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and agreed 
that it would be important for the UNSC to respond 
effectively to Iran's apparent rejection of the incentive 
package.
