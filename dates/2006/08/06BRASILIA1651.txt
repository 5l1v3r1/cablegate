¶1.  Brazilian Federal Police together with the Brazilian Institute 
for Environment and Renewable Resources (IBAMA) arrested 49 of a 
total 54 people accused of being part of an illegal logging ring. 
Among those apprehended were 16 IBAMA state officials and 33 timber 
industry entrepreneurs.  Similar to the gangs involved in operation 
Curupira in June of 2005 (reftel), the crimes consisted of forging 
ATPFs, the authorization to transport forest products issued by 
IBAMA.  Officials apprehended suspects in the states of Amapa, Para, 
Santa Catarina and Sao Paulo.  Over 700 thousand cubic meters of 
wood were sold at an estimated value of US$ 25 million over the last 
six years. 
 
¶2.  Investigations started in October, 2005 and involved over 200 
federal agents.  According to the Minister of Environment, Marina 
Silva, this is the tenth joint investigation against environmental 
crimes between the Federal Police and IBAMA, since 2003.  She added 
that such crimes have been going on for decades in Brazil and are 
only now being fought.  In order to minimize forgeries like these, 
IBAMA is computerizing the ATPF process authorizations in 
substitution for the hand made ones that are used nowadays.  By 
September 1st, 2006 federal authorities will accept only electronic 
ATPFs.
