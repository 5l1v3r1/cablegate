¶1. (SBU) After taking a three-day break, talks between Uganda and 
the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) resumed on August 18.  During the 
break, taken to mourn fallen LRA Commander Raska Lukwiya, Chief 
Mediator Riek Machar asked both parties to return with new position 
papers that had room for compromise.  According to an observer from 
UN OCHA, a delegation from Northern Uganda comprised of Acholi, 
religious, and civil leaders, as well as members of the Ugandan 
parliament, used the recess to work with the LRA delegation and 
encourage them to develop more realistic demands that better reflect 
the desires of the Northern Ugandan people.  These leaders are 
reportedly worried that the largely diaspora negotiating team has 
only a limited understanding of the situation on the ground. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Like the LRA negotiating team, the Northern Ugandan leaders 
appear to be keen on using these talks to address the grievances of 
all Northern Ugandans, even if that is not LRA leader Joseph Kony's 
priority.  The UN OCHA observer commented that if these negotiations 
were being done in the bush directly with Kony, it would "be over in 
two weeks."  However, Kony would only negotiate for his own safety 
and that of his commanders, and the root causes of the conflict 
would not be addressed. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The UN OCHA observer reiterated that support from the 
international community would be necessary to guarantee any 
agreement, and that the negotiations would go faster with 
international support.  He was concerned that most capitals were 
making their decisions based on the 2004 negotiations led by Ugandan 
representative Betty Bigombe, while not recognizing that the 
situation for the LRA has completely changed.  Acting Consul General 
repeated that the United States has no plans to become involved in 
the talks and that the USG will continue to be active in the contact 
group discussions in New York.
