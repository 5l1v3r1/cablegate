¶1. (U) Acting POLCOUNS delivered ref demarche on UNSC 
Resolution 1701 to Richard Maude, Assistant Secretary for 
Global Affairs and Director, Lebanon Crisis Management 
Center, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, on August 12. 
 
¶2. (U) Maude responded by referring to Foreign Minister 
Alexander Downer's media release and public remarks earlier 
in the day.  In his media release (text at para 4 below), FM 
Downer welcomed adoption of the resolution, commending the 
leadership of the United States and France in bringing it 
about.  He urged Hezbollah, which he termed "a terrorist 
organization," to stop all attacks against Israel, and for 
Israel to cease offensive operations in Lebanon, and called 
on the United Nations, Lebanon and Israel to work towards a 
sustainable and durable ceasefire, including full 
implementation of resolutions requiring the disarmament of 
all armed groups in Lebanon.  Downer also called on Iran and 
Syria to respect the resolution, as well as Israel's right to 
exist within secure borders. 
 
¶3. (U) In a separate press interview on August 12, FM Downer 
responded to an inquiry about commitment of Australian 
Defence Force (ADF) personnel to Lebanon by reiterating 
earlier GOA statements that Australia might provide some 
niche capability or logistical support but would be unable to 
provide large numbers of troops. 
 
¶4. (U) Following is the text of Foreign Minister Downer's 
August 12 media statement: 
 
Begin text: 
 
Lebanon Situation 
 
I welcome the unanimous adoption today of United Nations 
Security Council Resolution 1701 calling for the full 
cessation of hostilities in the conflict between Israel and 
Hezbollah.  I commend the leadership of the United States and 
France in achieving this outcome. 
 
The Australian Government has been deeply concerned about the 
loss of life in the conflict and its affect on civilian 
populations and has been calling for such a resolution. 
 
It is now essential that Hezbollah, a terrorist organization, 
stop all attacks against Israel.  Israel should also stop 
offensive operations in Lebanon in accordance with the terms 
of the resolution. 
 
I note the resolution authorizes the expansion of the mandate 
and size of UNIFIL, the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon. 
 
This resolution does not mean the end to the crisis.  This 
 
CANBERRA 00001224  002 OF 002 
 
 
will not occur until the underlying causes of the conflict 
are resolved. 
 
I call on the United Nations, the Government of Lebanon and 
the Government of Israel to work towards a sustainable and 
durable ceasefire.  This must be based on strict respect by 
all parties for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of 
both countries and full implementation of resolutions 
requiring the disarmament of all armed groups in Lebanon. 
 
It is also essential Iran and Syria respect the resolution, 
and Israel's right to exist within secure borders.
