PLAN TO DPM SAR KHENG 
 
REF: SECSTATE 123359 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Summary.  On August 4, the Ambassador delivered 
the Tier 2 Watch List Action Plan demarche to Deputy Prime 
Minister and Minister of Interior Sar Kheng, stressing the 
recommendations outlined in reftel.  The Ambassador added 
that he was concerned that Cambodia would become complacent 
and lose focus after doing a good job addressing the problem 
in 2005.  The DPM agreed with the recommendations and 
reported that the number of arrests for TIP-related crimes is 
down in the first half of 2006 compared to the same period in 
¶2005.  The Ambassador added that Cambodian government 
officials could do more to publicize the problem and educate 
communities.  The DPM agreed and proposed that the MOI 
organize meetings to explain human trafficking to average 
Cambodians who do not understand the issue.  End Summary. 
 
TIP:  Cambodia Cannot Become Complacent 
--------------------------------------- 
 
 ¶2.  (SBU)   On August 4, the Ambassador delivered the 
Trafficking in Persons demarche to DPM Sar Kheng and 
presented copies of reftel non-paper in English and Khmei. 
The Ambassador went on to press the DPM to help in three 
areas. First, he asked the government to increase the number 
of arrests and prosecutions for TIP-related crimes, and to 
ensure the penalties correspond to the seriousness of the 
crimes committed by those convicted.  Second, he asked that 
the Cambodian government demonstrate progress in combating 
trafficking-related corruption.  Finally, the Ambassador 
asked the Cambodian MOI to close down more establishments 
that offer victims of trafficking for sale.  He added that 
Cambodia has done a good job during the 2005 reporting 
period, but was concerned that Cambodia would become 
complacent and lose focus in the face of competing demands on 
law enforcement officials. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  The DPM thanked the Ambassador for his remarks and 
acknowledged that Cambodia needed to continue its efforts to 
graduate from Tier 2 Watch List status.  He agreed with the 
recommendations and the worry that Cambodia could become less 
vigorous in fighting trafficking in persons.  The DPM noted 
that a recent law enforcement report showed the number of 
offenders caught for TIP-related crimes is much less in the 
first half of 2006 than during the first six months of 2005. 
 Sar Kheng added that MOI has received a request for 
cooperation with International Justice Mission (IJM) and is 
examining it. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  The Ambassador recommended that the MOI work more 
closely with NGOs like IJM, and advocated that the MOI 
respond positively to IJM's proposal.  Furthermore, he 
suggested that high government officials speak out publicly 
against TIP. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  The DPM agreed and stated the MOI already does 
some public outreach, but many Cambodians do not understand 
human trafficking.  He saw the need for the government to do 
a better job in explaining the TIP issue at the grassroots 
level to help prevent families from selling their children. 
He thought more joint work needed to be done by the 
government and NGOs to tackle society's lack of knowledge. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  We also plan to present the demarche to National 
Police Commissioner Hok Lundy, and are working on a date/time 
for the meeting.  Getting Hok Lundy's attention focused on 
TIP problems will be key to sparking greater police action. 
We will present the police commissioner with more specific 
information supplied by NGOs regarding establishments and 
areas of Phnom Penh suspected of TIP activity where the 
police could usefully devote greater attention and 
investigative resources.  End Comment.
