¶1.  (SBU)  Econoff delivered reftels' points August 10 to Luc 
Lapene, head of the International Coordination Office at the French 
Civil Aviation Authority (DGAC).  Lapene indicated that France would 
attend the Montreal ICAO AVSEC panel meeting, and would be 
represented by one of DGAC's technical experts on aviation security, 
Alexandre Crozat.  In response to demarche, Lapene said that the 
issue was well worth full discussion, but noted that it was 
"complex."  Referring to the previous day's news of the U.K. 
terrorist plot to bomb airliners, he said that "things change," and 
that discussion would have to take into account the fundamental 
question of the trustworthiness of participants. Econoff underlined 
that for the U.S. this was an issue of privileges and immunities 
guaranteed by the Vienna Convention, and urged that DGAC coordinate 
with MFA to ensure that this was fully reflected in the French 
position. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Management Officer and Information Management Officer 
delivered points August 31 to Ministry of Foreign Affairs Acting 
Protocol Director (Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities) Pierre 
Filatoff, Deputy Director of Protocol Marie-Jeanne de Coquereaumont, 
and Chief of Diplomatic Pouch Services Bruno Guerquin. Filatoff 
advised that he would ensure the French delegation receives our 
demarche. Filatoff and Coquereaumont assured us that the GOF is in 
full agreement with the US position -- that the Vienna Convention 
does not permit the opening nor detention of diplomatic pouches and 
it supercedes guidance in the ICAO Security Manual.  They noted that 
it will be a fine point of discussion as to whether x-raying of 
diplomatic pouches is equivalent to opening them.  They pointed out, 
however, that in the "spirit" of the Vienna Convention diplomatic 
pouches should not be subject to x-raying. The GOF is therefore in 
full agreement with our position. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Diplomatic Pouch Chief Guerquin reminded us that the U.S. 
has access to the tarmac at French airports, access the French do 
not enjoy in the US.  Guerquin noted that while the Vienna 
Convention makes no distinction between classified and unclassified 
pouches (the latter being unaccompanied and thus not fully 
controlled by their government during shipment), the French see a 
clear distinction between the two types of pouches, and seek to 
ensure that classified pouches are not opened, detained, nor subject 
to x-raying. He reiterated that the Vienna Convention does not make 
the distinction between the two, but the accompanied (classified) 
pouch is the greater matter of concern.  Guerquin asked whether the 
US would be changing its policy on aviation security in light of 
recent developments.  Management Off replied that we had not 
obtained any guidance apart from the diplomatic pouch matter, and 
thanked the MFA officials for their assistance and support of our 
common position at the upcoming ICAO AVSEC Panel meetings.
