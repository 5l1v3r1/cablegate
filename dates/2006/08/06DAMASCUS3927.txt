Global Trafficking in Persons report, Post did not come 
across any public or private statements or media reports 
about trafficking in persons (TIP) or sexual exploitation and

Syria.  In follow-up to reftel, Post contacted the chief 
civilian personnel officer for UNDOF in Syria, Harbir Singh, 
who provided information about the extensive training of all 
of UNDOF's military personnel to prevent SEA and TIP.  There 
were no reports of SEA and TIP involving UNDOF personnel in
