¶1.  (SBU) In a 15 August meeting with Kuwaiti Minister of 
Finance Badr Meshari Al-Humaidhi, Ambassador asked about GOK 
aid to Lebanon.  The Finance Minister responded that the 
Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) would be depositing $500 
million in the Lebanese Central Bank.  (Note: KIA is Kuwait's 
government investment arm which manages Kuwait's General 
Reserve Fund, Future Generations Fund and any other monies 
committed by the Ministry of Finance.  It can make deposits 
in foreign banks at the Government's discretion without 
seeking National Assembly approval. End Note.)  Additionally, 
the Government pledged a cash grant of $300 million; this 
grant requires approval by the National Assembly. The 
Minister thought that approval would be swift.  The Cabinet 
also promised to grant $2 million to UN humanitarian bodies 
distributing relief in Lebanon in addition to an earlier 
grant of $20 million in urgent relief to Lebanon and the 
Palestinians. 
 
¶2.  (U) Separately, the Kuwaiti Red Crescent Society (KRCS) 
announced that it had rented seven buses to begin 
transporting Lebanese refugees from Syria to Beirut.  On 
August 15, the KRCS is sending a truck convoy with 240 tons 
of food aid, medical supplies, blankets, and clothing. 
Cumulative aid from KCRS delivered in 12 convoys since the 
conflict began amounts to 1734 tons. These supplies were 
provided largely from private donations collected by the 
Kuwait Lebanese Solidarity Committee, a newly established NGO. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Embassy is checking into any fuel assistance being 
provided.
