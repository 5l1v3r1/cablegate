POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
HURRIYET / ZAMAN / SABAH:       Nedim Seven, a senior member of 
the PKK, was caught in an operation Dutch police conducted at 
the border area with Belgium last week.  Turkey, who listed 
Seven in wanted notice, has launched efforts for Seven to be 
returned to Turkey. 
 
HURRIYET / ZAMAN / SABAH / YENI SAFAK:  After receiving a 
tip-off that terrorists were seen in an area between two 
districts of Sivas, security forces conducted an operation there 
and killed one terrorist.   Separately, a terrorist attempting 
to place an explosive on a road in Sirnak's Uludere district 
died when the explosive went off.  Meanwhile, teams of jandarma 
command found 10 kilograms of A-4 explosives in an area near a 
road in Agri's Taslicay district.  Sabah daily reported that 
three soldiers were wounded because of a mine blast in rural 
sections of Hakkari's Yuksekova district. 
 
EVRENSEL / YENI SAFAK:  A rocket attack was carried out on a 
police check point located at the entrance of Hakkari's Semdinli 
district late at night the previous day.  No casualties were 
reported. 
 
YENI SAFAK:     Jandarma teams seized a total of 31 unlicensed 
pistols, twenty of which were of Glock brand, in the fuel tank 
of a car in Sirnak's Uludere district, announced the Sirnak 
Governor's Office. 
 
EKSPRES / CUMHURIYET:   Per August 6, marking the 61st 
anniversary of atom bomb attack on Hiroshima, the spokesperson 
of Global Peace and Justice Commission (GPJC) in Adana said, as 
he pointed out the nuclear bombs allegedly kept at Incirlik 
airbase, that nobody was willing to live in a place jeopardized 
by the threat of nuclear bombs.   GPJC members will hold a 
protest as they ride their bicycles to the gate of the airbase 
on August 24 at 12.30. 
 
EVRENSEL:       Sultanbeyli district municipality (AKP) in Istanbul 
stopped construction of a Cemevi (Alawi worshipping place) whose 
ground-breaking was held on April 8 on grounds that the 
construction area was a basin for water supply.  Alawi community 
considered that move as a pretext for hindering Cemevi 
construction because the municipality has allegedly been 
ignoring 28,000 unlicensed buildings in Sultanbeyli. 
 
BOLGE / SABAH (GUNEY) / ZAMAN:  Adana Mayor made a call to 
district mayors to fight against unlicensed construction 
operations in the province.   The mayor accused the Seyhan 
Municipality bureaucrats for attempting to misguide the Seyhan 
Mayor about a controversial building whose construction has been 
completed.  Adana Mayor claims that the building can only be 
legal when it gets demolished.  Sabah Guney daily commented on 
the tension between the two municipalities and reported that two 
municipalities in fact shared the blame on unlicensed 
constructions in the province. 
 
RADIKAL / CUMHURIYET / ZAMAN / HURRIYET / EVRENSEL:     Two masked 
terrorists raiding the house of a non-commissioned officer of 
Jandarma Intelligence in Sirnak's Beytussebap district killed

died in a terrorist attack in Gumushane (see press summary 
08/07), have been received by their families in Mersin.

Society Party and EMEP (Party of Labor) issued a written 
statement to denounce a court decision imposing a 15-day ban on 
Ozgur Gundem daily's publication and dissemination. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM ONLINE:    Istanbul 12th Heavy Penalty Court lifted 
the ban on Ozgur Gundem upon appealing of the newspaper with the 
same court against its decision.  The newspaper will appear on 
shelves back again on Thursday. 
 
 
ADANA 00000178  002 OF 002 
 
 
CUMHURIYET / ZAMAN / RADIKAL / SABAH:   Two deputies resigned 
from SHP (Social Democratic People's Party) allegedly because

RADIKAL / YENI SAFAK:   A 50-person group in Van which was 
mostly comprised of women and children held a protest in front
