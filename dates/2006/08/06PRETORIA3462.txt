SUBJECT: SOUTH AFRICAN MEDIA SAYS PRESS FREEDOM IMPERILED BY 
GOVERNMENT PROPOSAL 
 
 
(U) This cable is Sensitive But Unclassified.  Not for Internet 
distribution. 
 
¶1.  (U) A government proposal to amend South African's Films & 
Publications Act has been met by howls of protest from media groups 
who say it would bring back pervasive censorship not seen since the 
apartheid era. Currently, the Act exempts newspapers from the 
publications covered by its censorship and classification 
provisions. The draft amendments would remove that exemption for 
newspapers and explicitly place broadcast media, which is regulated 
by other legislation, under its purview. Media advocates argue that 
those and other changes would force news groups to submit for 
pre-publication review material that could be viewed as sexual 
conduct, war propaganda, incitement to imminent violence or advocacy 
of hatred on any "identifiable group characteristic." 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Ministry of Home Affairs, which put forth the 
amendments, after days of silence finally responded to the criticism 
when a spokesperson was quoted in local media on August 19 as saying 
the government was largely concerned about where South Africa's 
often racy tabloid newspapers were sold. The spokesperson, Mantshele 
wa ga Tau, also was quoted as saying there would be no 
pre-censorship under the proposed amendments. The articles suggested 
the Ministry was open to changes in its draft proposal. The 
amendments, which still must be debated and approved by Parliament, 
also would bring interactive computer games, cell phones and the 
Internet under the law. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment: The proposed amendments to the Films & 
Publications Act represent the second time in recent months that 
South African ministries have proposed legislative changes that have 
touched off harsh criticism from freedom-of-expression advocates. 
Earlier this year, the Communications Minister proposed that she be 
allowed to hire and fire councilors to South Africa's broadcast 
regulatory body, which critics said would compromise its integrity. 
Ultimately, the Ministry backed down from the proposal, which 
President Thabo Mbeki also opposed. Reported comments from the 
Ministry of Home Affairs spokesman now suggest the draft amendments 
to the Films & Publications Act also may be changed in the face of 
widespread criticism. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment continued: If nothing else, these two examples 
suggest a lack of sensitivity in at least some ministries toward the 
importance of an independent media. A vibrant press free to 
criticize national leaders is a key element to the success of South 
Africa's young democracy; Embassy Pretoria will continue to monitor 
and report on further developments that may affect that freedom.
