SUBJECT: HOLY SEE:  DIPLOMATIC NOTE EXPRESSES CONCERN FOR 
CONSEQUENCES OF EMBARGO IN LEBANON 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Embassy has received a diplomatic note (N.5783/06/RS, 
in English) dated August 26 from the Holy See, concerning the 
humanitarian consequences of the embargo on Lebanon.  Text 
follows in para 2. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Begin text. 
 
The Secretariat of State, Section for Relations with States, 
presents its compliments to the Embassy of the United States of 
America and has the honour to draw the Embassy's attention to 
the grave humanitarian consequences of the continued full and 
indiscriminate air and naval embargo of Lebanon, aggravated by 
news of the recent decision of Syria to refuse that country its 
usual supply of electric power. 
 
The lack of raw materials and energy prevents the much-needed 
resumption of economic activity, which alone can enable the 
Lebanese people to embark upon the work of rebuilding and to 
look with confidence to the future, resisting the temptation -- 
ever present -- of emigration. 
 
The Secretariat of State, Section for Relations with States, 
thanks the Embassy for whatever steps will be concretely taken 
-- whether by Israel and Syria, or by Lebanon and the UNIFIL -- 
in order to resolve this grave problem, and avails itself of 
this occasion to renew to the Embassy of United States of 
America the assurance of its highest consideration. 
 
End text. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment:  The note is a reminder of the high priority 
of Lebanon for the Holy See, which has been in frequent contact 
with Embassy on this issue in recent weeks and remains deeply 
worried about the dwindling of the Christian population in the 
Middle East.  While Syria is criticized for cutting off power, 
the phrasing of the note ("indiscriminate") also reflects the 
Holy See's tendency to view the Israeli response to Hezbollah 
provocations as excessive.
