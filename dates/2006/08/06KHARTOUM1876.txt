SUBJECT:  AU Criticizes SLM for Torture Incident 
 
¶1.  On August 1, the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) released 
a statement regarding a recent incident of alleged torture that 
occurred on the AMIS compound in El Fasher, Darfur.  The statement 
calls on the SLM to cease such actions, investigate the incident, 
and to hold those accountable to blame. 
 
¶2.  The text of the statement is as follows: 
 
(Begin text) 
 
August 1, 2006 
 
Statement by the Special Representative of the Chairperson of the 
African Union Commission on the practice of torture by the SLA, Mini 
Minawi 
 
The attention of the Special Representative of the Chairperson of 
the African Union Commission in the Sudan, Ambassador Baba Gana 
Kingibe has been drawn to allegations of the practice of torture by 
the forces of the SLM loyal to Mr. Mini Arkoi Minawi.  These 
persistent and consistent allegations were brought to the attention 
of the SLA authorities. 
 
The Special Representative is, however, shocked and horrified at the 
incidence of torture which occurred in the SLA quarters in El Fasher 
whereby a middle aged unidentified individual was brutally beaten 
and blooded all over, including severe blows to his head, on two 
successive days, the 17th and 18th July, 2006.  When members of the 
AMIS Force Headquarters Company led by their company commander 
attempted to intervene, they were rebuffed by SLA elements who 
dragged the victim back into their compound.  Colonel Ali Mokhtar, 
the leader of the group claimed that the victim was an SLA soldier 
under discipline.  The fate of the victim is not known. 
 
This incident lends credence to the previous incessant allegations. 
Ambassador Kingibe deplores the practice of torture and abuse of 
Human Rights even if it involves a member of the SLA.  He urges Mr. 
Minawi to order an immediate end to this practice.  He further 
demands a thorough investigation of this particular incident and the 
culprits made accountable.  The AMIS is prepared to continue 
extending non military assistance within its means to the Sudanese 
parties as required by the DPA, but such cooperation cannot be 
expected by any party that condones torture and inhumane treatment 
of its own members, much less the civilian population in Darfur.
