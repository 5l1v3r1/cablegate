Classified By: Acting Political Chief David Schlaefer, for reasons 1.4 
(B) and (D) 
 
(C) Emboff delivered reftel points to MFA Human Rights Unit 
Director Johanna Suurpaa on August 25.  In subsequent 
discussions, MFA Political Director Pilvi-Sisko 
Vierros-Villenueve welcomed Washington's firm position in 
favor of delaying Kazakhstan's bid to chair the OSCE past 
Â¶2009.  Vierros-Villeneuve said that Finland had been 
concerned to note that Germany appeared to favor Almaty's 
candidacy, and she hoped that quiet but firm opposition from 
the U.S. may be sufficient to persuade Kazakhstan to defer to 
some of the better qualified candidates running for the 2009 
chairmanship.
