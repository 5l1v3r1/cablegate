(SBU) On August 16 we delivered reftel points (Ref A) 
to Acting MFA Director General for Security Policy, 
Arti Hilpus, who reiterated that it is unlikely that 
the GOE will contribute to the international 
peacekeeping force due its commitments in Afghanistan 
and Iraq (Ref B).  However, Hilpus noted, the GOE has 
not yet decided what to do with the two Estonian 
observers serving in Lebanon and Syria with the UN 
Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO).
