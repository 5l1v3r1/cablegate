REF: JERUSALEM 03252 
 
¶1.    (SBU) The Rafah crossing did not open as planned on 
August 1 in order to allow more time for coordination among 
the concerned parties.  As a result, the planned departure 
from Gaza of approximately 77 Americans and 10 PD grantees 
was also delayed.  Post is attempting to facilitate the 
transfer of the Amcits and grantees via the Erez crossing and 
onward to Jordan. 
 
¶2.    (SBU) The IDF fired more than 350 tank shells into 
northern and southern Gaza on July 31, killing one 
Palestinian teenager and wounding at least 11 others 
(reftel).  Israeli aircraft fired several rockets near Khan 
Younis overnight July 31-August 1.  A Palestinian died July 
31 from injuries received during the July 19 Israeli 
incursion into the al-Maghazi refugee camp. 
 
¶3.    (SBU) Palestinian militants launched five Qassam 
rockets the morning of August 1 from northern Gaza toward 
Sderot and the Western Negev.  At least seven Qassam rockets 
were fired into Israel on July 31.  There were no reported 
injuries or damage.  The al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades and the 
PFLP claimed responsibility for the rocket fire.  The IDF 
responded to the rocket fire by shelling parts of northern 
Gaza. 
 
¶4.    (SBU) In the West Bank, the IDF arrested seven 
Palestinians, mostly Fatah and Hamas activists, overnight 
July 31-August 1 in Ramallah, Tulkarm, Jenin, and Nablus.  An 
explosive charge damaged a section of the separation barrier 
near Tulkarm on July 31.  IDF units arrived and sealed the 
opening.  The IDF raided the Tulkarm offices of a Hamas PLC 
member the morning of August 1 and confiscated computers and 
documents.  IDF units also entered Jenin and Qabatiyah 
village reportedly in search of gunmen.  There were no 
reported arrests.  The IDF has imposed a total closure in the 
West Bank until August 5. 
 
¶5.    (SBU) Palestinians demonstrated in Gaza City, Ramallah, 
Nablus, and Hebron July 31 to protest Israeli military action 
in Gaza and Lebanon.  Several Palestinian factions 
participated in the demonstrations, which included speeches 
condemning U.S. support of Israel and preventing the UN 
Security Council from adopting a resolution to stop the war 
in Lebanon.  More protests are planned for August 1, 
including a demonstration in the main square in Ramallah, as 
well as in Gaza, Nablus, and Tulkarm.  A group of about 50 
individuals protested near the Consulate's Post II facility 
in East Jerusalem on August 1.  The crowd was dispersed by 
Israeli police.

reported that 207 truckloads transited the 
Karni/al-Mintar crossing into Gaza July 31.
