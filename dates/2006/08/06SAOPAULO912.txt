Chavez, the Illusionist 
 
Center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (8/21) editorialized: "President 
Hugo Chavez is a great illusionist.... On one hand he announces a 
'21st century Socialism' and fools the naove ones from whom he 
requests support to fight against the United States and capitalism. 
But, on the other hand he increases trade with the U.S. and turns 
Venezuela into a banker's paradise. Chavez has established dazzling 
accords with Cuba and Bolivia...but these are not the countries he 
trades with in reality-it is with the U.S. he does so...bilateral 
trade grew 36% in 2005...it was the fastest growth among the U.S. 
largest trade partners.... The 'Bolivarian Revolution,' which was 
supposed to redeem the poor and oppressed, has created a new class 
of millionaires and consolidated existing fortunes.... This is how 
Hugo Chavez is fulfilling his goal to 'transform the structures of 
capitalism.' After all, foes are foes, but business is business."
