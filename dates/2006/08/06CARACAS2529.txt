SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (U)  This cable is an update on the Bolivarian Republic 
of Venezuela's (BRV) efforts to restrict freedom of press. 
As indicated in reftels, the BRV employs a variety of 
mechanisms - legal, economic, regulatory, judicial, and 
rhetorical - to harass the private media, inducing 
self-censorship and engendering a repressive, almost 
fascistic, attitude towards the free press.  Topics addressed 
in this update include: 
 
-Ortega jailbreak's impact on the press; 
-Lara newspaper facing state-sponsored aggression; 
-Border security, BRV-style: attack journalists; 
-Trials and tribulations of Miguel Salazar continue; 
-Overseas Press Club of America sends letter to Chavez 
condemning press record; and 
-Press regains access to the Palacio de Justicia. 
 
END SUMMARY 
 
-------------------------------------- 
ORTEGA ESCAPE'S IMPACT ON A FREE PRESS 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U)  Globovision reported August 15 that independent 
journalists were denied access to penal installations at Ramo 
Verde, the military prison from which political prisoners 
Carlos Ortega and the Faria family reportedly escaped on 
August 13.  The escape story (ref a) received prominent play 
in all media outlets.  According to Globovision, only 
official government media outlets have been given access 
inside the facility.  Globovision further reports that on 
August 17, several of their journalists were detained while 
covering the processing of the fourteen military officials 
charged with involvement in the escape. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Before conducting a full investigation, the BRV 
directly accused opposition media of complicity in the Ortega 
prison escape.  Minister of Interior and Justice Jesse Chacon 
said August 16 that there were indications that Globovision 
employee Edith Ruiz knew beforehand of the planned escape, 
leaving the path open for yet another legal action against a 
media personality.  Ruiz, Manager for Institutional Relations 
at Globovision, informed PAS staff on August 14 that she is 
concerned for her safety as a result of the BRV's attempts to 
involve her in the escape. 
 
¶4.  (U)  Piggybacking on Chacon's comments, the government 
organization Journalists for the Truth (Periodistas por la 
Verdad de Venezuela) also accused Globovision of involvement 
in the escape.  This organization's director, Marcos 
Hernandez, expressed his conviction that Globovision had 
advance knowledge of the escape, due to its detailed coverage 
of the story.  Hernandez points to the network's coordinated 
approach to the story, including interviews with the 
escapees' attorneys and family members, as evidence of 
advance knowledge of the plot. 
 
¶5.  (U)  Attorney General Isaias Rodriguez announced August 
17 that the Public Ministry would open an investigation 
against "all persons who have shown solidarity or support" 
for the Ortega/Faria escape.  Rodriguez insinuated that such 
individuals could be held accountable for speaking in defense 
of persons whose actions may threaten public safety.  He 
emphasized that both individuals and media outlets would be 
subject to the investigation, opening yet another flimsy 
 
CARACAS 00002529  002.2 OF 003 
 
 
avenue for future media and political persecution. 
 
------------------------------- 
PROTESTS AGAINST LARA NEWSPAPER 
------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (U)  The Interamerican Press Society (SIP) condemned 
August 8 threats and intimidation against daily "El Caroreno" 
(Lara state).  The threats, supposedly orchestrated by 
municipal employees, were motivated by the critical editorial 
bent of the newspaper towards the local administration, 
charges SIP.  On July 26, some 40 individuals, including 
municipal employees, forced their way into a radio interview, 
hurling invective at the newspaper's editor, the interviewee. 
 Protesters then began burning issues of the newspaper and 
threatening to set fire to the building. 
 
------------------------------------ 
DISIP ATTACKS JOURNALISTS IN TACHIRA 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶7.  (U)  Three journalists working for regional newspaper 
"Diario Los Andes" were attacked July 25 while investigating 
a story on border security in Tachira state, according to an 
alert issued by the local NGO Institute for Press and 
Society.  DISIP (intelligence) agents reportedly detained the 
journalists' vehicle after spotting the photographer taking 
pictures, demanding they turn over the camera.  One of the 
journalists - a woman - was beaten by a DISIP agent 
attempting to pull her from the vehicle. 
 
----------------------- 
DELAYING THE INEVITABLE 
----------------------- 
 
¶8.  (U)  A Circuit Court judge August 11 issued an arrest 
warrant against Miguel Salazar, editor of the weekly "Las 
Verdades de Miguel."  Salazar, already facing prosecution for 
aggravated slander, reportedly failed to appear before the 
court, as ordered by the judge.  Salazar is accused of 
slandering several high-ranking officials, including the 
former Secretary of the Presidency, the governor of Guarico 
state, and a National Assembly deputy and his political 
party.  Salazar's attorneys called for the recusal of the 
judge, a tactic they have now used three times.  This move, 
in conjunction with the month-long judicial recess, has led 
to the postponement of Salazar's trial until September. 
 
---------------------- 
CONDEMNATION FROM AFAR 
---------------------- 
 
¶9.  (U)  The Overseas Press Club of America (OPC) addressed a 
letter to President Chavez July 11, condemning Venezuela's 
repression of the freedom of expression.  The letter 
highlights four incidents: a journalist accused of defamation 
and slander by the Minister of Infrastructure for reporting 
on the collapse of the viaduct to the airport (an issue that 
nearly every Caraqueno has bemoaned in the last several 
months); a conviction in Guarico state for criminal 
defamation of the governor (ref b); the baseless accusations 
against daily "El Correo del Caroni" of "waging state 
terrorism" (ref b); and the threatened review of broadcasting 
licenses for media outlets, from President Chavez and 
Minister of Communications and Information Willian Lara (ref 
c).  The OPC delicately invites Chavez to "clear your own 
good name."  Copies of the letter were also sent to Attorney 
General Rodriguez, Minister Lara, Ambassador Alvarez in 
Washington, Ambassador Toro in New York, Ambassador 
Brownfield and the Inter-American Press Association. 
 
------------------------ 
A PRESS FREEDOM VICTORY? 
 
CARACAS 00002529  003.2 OF 003 
 
 
------------------------ 
 
¶10.  (U)  Supreme Court Magistrate Eladio Aponte Aponte 
announced August 15 the reopening of the press room at the 
Palacio de Justicia.  The court's press room had been closed 
since November 2005, when ex-judge Belkys Cedeno cut the 
electricity during a dissenting judge's statement to 
journalists.  Aponte issued a statement saying the Judiciary 
has nothing to hide and that this measure is a way of 
demonstrating that freedom of the press exists in the BRV. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶11.  (SBU)  With presidential elections looming in December, 
Chavez can be expected to make new efforts to appear 
democratic, but will continue to rely on authoritarian 
tactics.  Similarly, Chavez can be expected to trumpet 
Venezuela's supposed excellent climate for freedom of 
expression, while Chavista police, prosecutors, and judges 
continue to keep the free press on the run.  Whomever the 
messenger, the strategy remains the same: silencing critics 
and scaring those who may dare to speak out.
