SUBJECT: BOUTEFLIKA SENDS BIRTHDAY GREETINGS TO KING 
MOHAMMED VI 
 
The official French-language daily El Moudjahid reported on 
August 20 that President Bouteflika congratulated King 
Mohammed VI of Morocco on the occasion of the latter's 
birthday.  In his message, Bouteflika noted that the King's 
birthday was adjacent to the anniversary of "La Revolution du 
Roi et du peuple," which marked the return from exile of King 
Mohammed V and was important in Morocco's fight for 
independence from France, and also adjacent to the 
anniversary of "le Congres a la Soummam," an important 
occurrence in Algeria's fight for independence from France. 
Bouteflika remarked that the dates reinforced the bond 
between the two countries, as both had engaged in a "common 
heroic fight" exacting a "heavy toll for independence and 
freedom."  President Bouteflika further pledged to work with 
King Mohammed VI to improve relations between Algeria and 
Morocco.
