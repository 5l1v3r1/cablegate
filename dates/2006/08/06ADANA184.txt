RADIKAL: Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, who was commenting on 
Iraqi government's recent ban on activities of the PKK in 
northern Iraq, said that the PKK was an evil source causing 
dissension to prevail over solidarity between Turks and Kurds. 
It is to the benefit of them (Iraqi government) that they 
cooperate with Turkey, and the PKK constitutes a problem for 
both of the countries, which are undeniable components of the 
region, said Gul. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM: Mahmut Osman, a Kurdish politician and member of 
the Iraqi Parliament, harshly criticized the Iraqi government 
for shutting down the PKK offices in Iraq. 
 
RADIKAL: PKK attempted to carry out a bomb attack on a jandarma 
station in a village in Mardin's Midyat district with a donkey 
carrying explosives.   However, the donkey, heading towards the 
fields instead of the jandarma station, exploded in the open 
field. 
 
ZAMAN / RADIKAL / CUMHURIYET / OZGUR GUNDEM / EVRENSEL: PKK 
terrorists detonated a remote-controlled bomb on a road in 
Tunceli 500 meters away from a police checkpoint at 8.45 a.m. 
yesterday morning as a vehicle carrying the duty officers were 
passing by.  Two special team members were killed and one 
wounded. 
 
RADIKAL: Police caught three terrorists in Antalya's Alanya 
district making preparations to launch an attack with 1.5 
kilograms of explosives and cell phone devices. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM: The daily reported on its front-page allegations 
of a senior PKK member claiming that MIT intelligence center 
officials, who infiltrated northern Iraq to kill PKK officials, 
were recently caught and were being interrogated.  The senior 
PKK member claimed that the KP government has launched an fresh 
effort to kill the senior PKK members. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:  PKK headquarters instructed its members to abide 
by the agreement signed with the Swiss-based Geneva Call 
Organization on July 15, 2006 on not using anti-personnel mines. 
 PKK headquarters said that they have been in contact with the 
UN supported non-governmental organization Geneva Call for about 
a year. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM: Kurdish people started celebrating the anniversary 
of the first-ever PKK attack which was carried out on August 15, 
1984 in Siirt's Eruh district and Hakkari's Semdinli district. 
Police opened fire in Adana as people attempted to stage a 
demonstration to mark the event.  A young person was shot in the 
head and reportedly entered a vegetative state.  Another young 
person was also wounded.  Police carried out operations until 
early in the morning in the quarters of the province where Kurds 
lived.   Meanwhile, police raised security levels in provinces 
such as Diyarbakir, Hakkari, Sirnak, Tunceli, Mardin, Bingol and 
Van because of the sensitive August 15 pro-PKK anniversary.  The 
control at entrances of the sensitive provinces has been 
tightened.

(Union of Municipalities of Southeasern Anatolia) established an 
initiative to investigate the cause of the fires.
