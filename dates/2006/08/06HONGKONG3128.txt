Econoff delivered reftel demarche to Hong Kong Trade and 
Industry Department (TID) Assistant Director General Petty 
Lai on July 26.  On August 2, Lai told Econoff that draft 
text on the IPR guidelines was already complete and commented 
the situation with the Counter Terrorism Task Force (CTTF) 
was "difficult," especially regarding the issue of the CTTF 
Chairman position.  Lai said that TID was still consulting 
other Hong Kong Government bureaus and departments on the 
other specific demarche points and would send a written 
response to us as soon as possible.
