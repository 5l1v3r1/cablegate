SUBJECT: COTE D'IVOIRE: EXAM RESULTS ANNOUNCED, STRIKING 
TEACHERS BYPASSED 
 
REF: ABIDJDAN 927 
 
¶1.  On August 22, 2006, the Ministry of Education announced 
the results of the baccalaureate exam (required for entry 
from secondary school to university) held July 25-28 in the 
government-controlled zones.  Out of 119,256 students who 
took the exam, 48,168 students passed.  The Ministry was only 
able to announce the results because the Minister of 
Education forwarded the exam papers to teachers in other 
cities such as Dimbokro, Daloa and Yamassoukro, bypassing 
teachers who had initially marked the exams but refused to 
release results until they had received payment for 
proctoring and grading them (reftel). 
¶2.  The group of striking teachers who refused to release the 
exam grades calls itself the Coordination for the Claim and 
the Revaluation of Teachers, Rights (CRRDE).  These teachers 
are alleging potential fraud by the substitute graders and 
are demanding that the exam results be cancelled.  The CRDDE 
has also threatened, if it is not paid, to use all its means 
to block the start of the 2006-2007 academic year.  Since 
sources within other teachers' unions tell us they too 
support CRRDE's demands,  additional teacher labor actions 
and disruptions seem likely when the new school year begins 
in October.
