Classified By: Acting Political-Economic Counselor 
Karen C. Reider for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
(C) Poloff delivered reftel A on July 31 to Czech MFA Asia 
Department's Head of the Far East and Pacific Unit Ivana 
Grollova. Grollova said the EU decision to permit a lower 
level Burmese official to attend ASEM was reached on the 
basis of thoughtful discussions among EU ministers (ref B). 
Therefore, she believes this consensus decision is not likely 
to be reversed. The Czechs supported the decision on the 
condition that the EU use the Burmese Foreign Minister's 
attendance at ASEM as an opportunity to have substantive 
discussions on human rights violations in Burma. Grollova 
said the Czechs are also pressing for an EU-sponsored 
resolution on Burmese human rights abuses at UNGA.
