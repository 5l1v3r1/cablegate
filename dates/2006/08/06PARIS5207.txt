SUBJECT: U.S. COMMENTS ON NORWEGIAN SEVEN-COUNTRY 
NONPROLIFERATION INITIATIVE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 121698 
 
U.S. comments on Norway's Seven-Country Nonproliferation 
Initiative (reftel) were delivered July 26 to French MFA 
nonproliferation desk officer Arnaud Mentre.  In a follow-up 
conversation on July 28, Mentre said that the GOF appreciated 
the comments, noting that the tone was respectful yet 
prudent.  He said that he had read the Norweigan proposal and 
U.S. comments side-by-side, with special attention paid to 
the U.S. concern that nonproliferation be made more prominent 
(rather than disarmament) and that Fissile Material Control 
Treaty negotiations take place immediately.
