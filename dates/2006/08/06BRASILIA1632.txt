¶1. On August 4, 2006, Embassy received from the Brazilian Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs, Division of Science and Technology, (DCTEC/MFA) 
an official notification (number 044, dated August 4, 2006) 
approving the research project proposal entitled "Genetic Analysis 
Of Cholinergic Function: Implications to Alzheimer's Disease," 
(number TW007800 01).  Informal translation of the approval notice 
follows: 
 
Begin text: 
 
"This is to inform that after consultation to the appropriate 
federal organs, the project titled "Genetic Analysis of Cholinergic 
Function: Implications to Alzheimer's Disease," to be developed by 
Dr. Marco Antonio Prado and Vania Prado, from University of Minas 
Gerais;  Dr. Ivan Isquierdo, from PUC-RS and Dr. Luiz Reis, from 
Instituto Ludwing de Pesquisa de Cancer, financially supported by 
the National Institutes of Health (NIH), was approved by the 
Brazilian Government, with the following comments made by the 
researchers: 
"The National Institutes of Health (NIH) made a mistake on the 
amount reported in the '1820 form Status Snapshot,' and the correct 
annual amount is US$ 100.000,00 for site 1 (University of Minas 
Gerais/UFMG).  The general coordinators for this project are Dr. 
Marco Antonio Prado and Dr. Vania Prado; Dr. Ivan Izquierdo and Dr. 
Luiz Reis are only collaborators for the project." 
 
2)I emphasize that for the collection and transfer of data and/or 
biological material abroad, procedures should conform to current 
legislation. 
 
Cordially, 
(signature) 
Everton Frask Lucero 
Head of the Division of Science and Technology"
