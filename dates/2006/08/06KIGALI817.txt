SUBJECT: DEATH OF AMCIT MACH VISUDH AROM 
 
 
¶1. On Tuesday, August 22, 2006 AMCIT Mach Visudh Arom died of 
apparent sudden cardiac arrest in the region of Ruhengeri, 
Rwanda. 
 
¶2. Mr. Arom was born on March 29, 1968 in Minnesota. 
Passport number 074699483. 
 
¶3. Acting Consular Officer was notified on August 22, 2006 by 
Chris Donovan, Rwanda Country Director for the International 
Rescue Committee (IRC).  The Rwandan National Police also 
notified RSO. 
 
¶4. NOK are the parents of Mr. Arom, who reside in Thailand. 
Next of kin were notified by telephone by Michael Despines, 
an AMCIT colleague of the deceased who was with him at the 
time of death. 
 
¶5. The remains left Rwanda on Kenya Airways flight KQ274 on 
August 23.  Final destination of the remains is Bangkok, 
Thailand.  Expected time of arrival in Bangkok is August 24 
at 11:25am local time on Kenya Airways flight KQ230, which 
originates in Nairobi.  The body is being escorted by Michael 
Despines and the IRC's regional director. 
 
¶6. Medical reports indicate that the presumed cause of death 
was sudden cardiac arrest leading to heart attack.  No 
autopsy was performed (Note: Rwandan law does not require an 
autopsy in the case of a natural or accidental death).  Mr. 
Arom, whose trip to Rwanda was organized by the IRC, 
reportedly collapsed just as he was completing a gorilla trek 
in Rwanda's Volcanoes National Park.  Gorilla Treks, which 
are led by park rangers, are high altitude hikes that 
sometimes involve long distances and strenuous terrain. 
After collapsing, Mr. Arom was taken by IRC vehicle to the 
provincial hospital in Ruhengeri.  A/RSO and A/Con Off were 
notified of Mr. Arom's condition by Chris Donovan. A/Con Off 
attempted to reach Dr. Caleb King, an AMCIT doctor who works 
at the hospital in Ruhengeri.  King was out of Ruhengeri but 
A/Con Off spoke with his wife, who alerted hospital officials 
that Mr. Arom was being brought in.  Mr. Arom was declared 
dead on arrival at the hospital.
