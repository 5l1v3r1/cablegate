¶1.  On August 3, 2006, Embassy delivered to Secretary Everton F. 
Lucero, Head of the Division of Science and Technology, Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs (DCTEC/MFA), for review and approval, the National 
Institutes of Health's (NIH) proposed award of a research project 
titled "Assessment of Safety and Toxicity Among Infants Born to 
HIV-1 Infected Women," (number PACTG 1054-ACTG 5190).  The site 
covered in this project is under the direction of Dr. Esau Custodio 
Joao, from Hospital Servidores do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (RJ), 
Brazil. 
 
¶2.  The Embassy sees no adverse foreign policy implications with 
respect to this research project.  We emphasize the importance of 
complying with Brazilian laws on the export of data and biological 
material. 
 
¶3.  We are providing this assessment of foreign policy implications 
in advance of receiving approval from the Brazilian Government for 
the proposed research to go forward, in order to assist NIH in 
completing the domestic review process.  Upon receipt of Brazilian 
approval, the Embassy will notify NIH by cable.
