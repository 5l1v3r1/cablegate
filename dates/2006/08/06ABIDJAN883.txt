REF: ABIDJAN 454 
 
¶1.  On June 10, five chickens and a wild bird were discovered 
dead in an industrial rubber plantation near the port city of 
San Pedro, 500 km southwest of Abidjan.  According to a July 
20 report published by the Ministry of Animal Husbandry, the 
specimens tested on June 28 by the National Agricultural 
Development Support Laboratory of Bingerville (near Abidjan) 
revealed the birds were infected with Avian Influenza (AI). 
 
¶2.  According to our World Health Organization contacts, the 
results of the initial test did confirm that the animals died 
from AI, but there has not yet been a second test to 
determine which strain it was.  WHO contacts told us that the 
government's response to the suspected presence of AI in San 
Pedro has included partial culling, screening and 
disinfection of the affected premises.  Poultry vaccination 
operations were also reportedly carried out in the 
surrounding area in order to contain the disease.  A 
sensitization and information campaign was organized for 
consumers and poultry farmers in the San Pedro region. 
 
¶3.  There have been no further reports of AI in Cote 
d'Ivoire.  Post will continue to monitor the situation.
