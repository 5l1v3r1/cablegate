¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The situation in Kabul and the 
provinces with regard to the Korean groups remains 
calm. Hundreds of Koreans were deported today 
through Mazar-e-Sharif and Herat. Some groups of 
Americans have been identified, contacted, and 
offered assistance. We expect most will leave the 
country on Saturday, August 5. There are no signs 
indicating widespread demonstrations or violence for 
Saturday, although as always, Kabul is not 
completely secure. END SUMMARY. 
 
AMERICAN CITIZENS 
 
¶2. (SBU) Consular section continues to locate and 
contact groups of Americans to check on their 
welfare and safety. A group of 44 Americans and some 
Canadian citizens are expected to return to Kabul 
from Bamiyan tomorrow. Three groups of Americans 
have already been contacted in Kabul, totaling 
approximately 12. We have heard of more Amcits in 
Kabul but are unable to confirm their location or 
welfare. Some of the Americans have been told by the 
GoA that they will be sent back to Dubai, their 
transit city, tomorrow. 
 
SECURITY 
 
¶3. (SBU) The situation remains calm in Kabul, Herat, 
Bamiyan, and Mazar-e-Sharif. There were no known 
demonstrations today and no indications that they 
will occur tomorrow. The MOI has created a detailed 
and comprehensive plan in case of disruptions 
tomorrow. (COMMENT: CSTC-A and the Embassy have 
reviewed the plan and consider it effective. See 
SEPTEL. END COMMENT.) The GoA has responded to the 
situation by splitting up the groups of Koreans and 
spreading them throughout the city while preventing 
them from gathering in large groups to protect their 
security. Koreans in the provinces are also not 
being allowed to return to Kabul without special 
authorization. 
 
DEPARTURES 
 
¶4. (SBU) Post has received word that hundreds of 
Koreans have been ushered out of the country today. 
The Korean Embassy and GoA worked together to 
provide flights back to Herat and Mazar-e-Sharif for 
those who entered via Iran and Uzbekistan. About 
100-200 others were slated to depart today and 
tomorrow for Kazakhstan, China, India, and UAE. 
 
COMMENT 
 
¶5. (SBU) The situation seems to be under control. 
The GoA has effectively eliminated any chance for 
the Korean group to hold events. The GoA has also 
created a very thorough plan to deal with potential 
emergencies. Post has seen no indications of 
potential violence but will continue to track the 
continuing situation. END COMMENT.
