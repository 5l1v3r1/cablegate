¶1. Summary: On August 4, Ambassador Sobel hosted a lunch for S/P 
Director Stephen Krasner and a cadre of Ministry of External 
Relations (MRE) and international officials, following Krasner's 
consultations with GOB officials on the Partnership in Democratic 
Governance (PDG) initiative.  GoB interlocutors emphasized building 
a new triangular paradigm for development assistance, focusing on 
education, renewable energy development and Brazilian foreign 
assistance to highlight how the principal could be applied.  World 
Bank Director, John Briscoe, underscored the necessity of 
streamlining assistance processes if developed countries wanted to 
maintain their position of leadership in providing aid and building 
strong democratic governments.  End Summary 
 
---------- 
Education 
---------- 
 
¶2. Alessandro Candeas, who heads International Relations at the 
Ministry of Education, noted the increased importance placed on 
policy planning in terms of education and he explained Brazil's new 
idea for a "triangular modality" in education assistance.  This new 
paradigm involves pairing developed, developing (E9) and 
underdeveloped countries in a consortium to back education through 
teacher training, exchange programs, school meal programs, and the 
like.  Partnering along the familiar North-South-South line, E9 
countries whose domestic programming, know-how and educational 
challenges are closer to those of underdeveloped states would 
utilize third party resource and technical expertise to implement 
assistance.  Candaes pointed out that the proposed modality was 
appended to the 2006 G8 Summit Document (the only non-G8 suggestion 
accepted).

Foreign Assistance 
------------------ 
 
¶3. Recently returned from Haiti, Achilles Zaluar Neto of the MRE's 
UN Division stressed the disconnect in Haiti between the fledgling 
government, the peacekeeping force, and various aid organizations' 
activities; and he stressed the need to harmonize aid structures and 
political policies into coordinated initiatives.  Underscoring again 
the need for a triangular paradigm, MRE UN Division Chief, Glivania 
Oliveira, highlighted a Brazilian project in East Timor to 
strengthen the country's judicial process.  She used the example to 
illustrate how a country like Brazil is capable of providing 
assistance in terms of language, culture and social/political will. 
The caveat is that developing nations lack the resources to provide 
assistance on a larger scale.  Here again developed countries can 
help augment assistance. 
 
-------- 
Biofuels 
-------- 
 
¶4. The MRE's new Energy Director, Antonio Simoes, outlined the GoB's 
goal of utilizing renewable fuels (emphasis on ethanol) as a 
mechanism to alleviate poverty and build infrastructure in 
underdeveloped countries, not-to-mention other countries in South 
America.  According to Simoes, the GoB's ultimate goal is to share 
the technology that will lead to a worldwide biofuel matrix.  The 
proposed bilateral MOU with the U.S. and the fledgling Ethanol Forum 
are mechanisms to find the ways and means to achieve this ethanol 
ethos.  Simoes concluded by recommending that both Brazil and the 
U.S. attend the regional conference of Energy Ministers in Trinidad 
in the beginning of September.  Greg Manuel of S/P expressed the 
Department's interest in the GoB's proposals and a desire to find a 
path forward. 
He noted that the Department is working on articulating 
a position that will provide a way forward for cooperation 
on biofuels. 
 
------------------------- 
U.S. - Brazil Partnership 
------------------------- 
 
¶5. S/P McIlhenny noted President Lula's carefully articulated vision 
of democratic integration in the region, suggesting that this 
reflected an affinity of values that should make it possible for 
Brazil and the U.S. to work creatively together in new forms of 
partnership that serve shared interests.  In fact, that engagement 
was already emerging in creative ways that bolstered democratic 
governance, witness the joint Brazil/U.S. project in Guinea Bissau. 
Few might have expected, five years ago, that this sort of 
partnership would emerge between us.  That it has reflects a 
pragmatic approach on both sides that augurs well for other 
cooperation.

¶6.  John Briscoe of the World Bank put the meeting in perspective by 
relating an assistance tale from Mozambique.  When countries like 
the United States and Brazil drag their feet, China enters and fills 
in the capacity building void.  The story's moral: governments need 
to change the way they view assistance, to streamline aid processes 
and to find novel ways to support capacity building endeavors.  The 
meeting hammered home the point that politics and economics are 
inexorably intertwined and, therefore, need to be linked. End
