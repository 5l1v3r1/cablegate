(SBU) On August 7, poloff conveyed reftel points urging 
support for draft resolution on Lebanon to Lee Kyung-chul, 
Deputy Director of the UN Division at the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and Trade (MOFAT).  Lee on August 8 expressed 
appreciation for the draft text, which his office had shared 
with colleagues within MOFAT and with the ROK mission in New 
York.  Seoul, however, did not have any comment on the draft 
text at this time because discussions were still ongoing at 
the UN Security Council, he said.
