SUBJECT: NORTHERN UGANDA: CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES NOT A 
CEASE-FIRE 
 
 
 ¶1.   The Government of Uganda has agreed to a cessation of 
hostilities--not a cease-fire--to allow members of the Lord's 
Resistance Army (LRA) to assemble at two sites.  Rebels in 
northern Uganda will move to a site in southern Sudan. 
Rebels in Garamba National Park will go to a designated site 
in Congo.  The Government expects to sign the agreement later 
today (August 25) that will allow safe passage for LRA 
members to assemble at the designated areas.  The agreement 
will take affect on August 29 and give the LRA two weeks to 
move to the assembly areas.  The two-week deadline can be 
extended if the LRA is still moving toward assembly sites. 
The Government will publicize the agreement through various 
radio networks.  Once in the assembly areas, the Governments 
of South Sudan and Uganda will provide for the LRA members 
welfare, including food and medical assistance. 
International donors may be called upon to assist depending 
on the numbers of LRA that choose to assemble. 
 
¶2.  The agreement is not a cease-fire but will "create a 
conducive environment" for the remaining issues for a 
cease-fire to be hammered out.  The Government of Uganda 
insists that the assembled LRA members are under a 
"controlling authority" as a sign of good faith.  The 
Government estimates that there are 300 LRA members at 
Garamba and 134 in northern Uganda. 
 
¶3.  Comment:  The Government of Uganda is again trying to 
build the confidence of LRA members and leaders in the peace 
process by demonstrating flexibility and a commitment to a 
soft landing for LRA members.  We do not expect LRA leader 
Joseph Kony or Vincent Otti to participate in the exercise, 
but instead rank-and-file and mid-level LRA may take 
advantage.  Much will depend on the details of the agreement.
