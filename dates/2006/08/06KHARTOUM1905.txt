¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  On July 31, over 6,000 people attended the 
Government of Southern Sudan's (GoSS) memorial service in Juba for 
their late leader, Dr. John Garang, who died one year earlier. 
Congressman Donald Payne led the U.S. delegation to the event. 
During his speech, GoSS President Salva Kiir complained of slow CPA 
implementation, while reaffirming his support for a UN deployment in 
Darfur.  During the proceedings, and more emphatically in private 
meetings with the congressman, Garang's widow Rebecca demanded an 
expanded investigation into the circumstances of her husband's 
death.  Also during the event, the Governor of Central Equatoria 
(Bahr Al Jebel) State, a militia leader and member of the northern 
National Congress Party, officially joined SPLM.  End Summary.

International Community Supports GoSS, CPA 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (U) Speakers from the international community, including UN 
Special Representative to the Secretary General (SRSG) Jan Pronk, AU 
Special Representative Baba Gana Kingibe, Norwegian Minister of 
International Development Hilde Johnson, and representatives from 
East Africa, Egypt, France, Italy.  Both Congressman Payne and 
Special Representative of the Deputy Secretary Roger Winter also 
spoke, emphasizing the United States' continued commitment to peace, 
stability, and development in Sudan. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
NCP Criticized, Contradicted, and Contracted 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) Salva Kiir Mayardit, who assumed Garang's position as First 
Vice President of the Republic of the Sudan and the President of the 
GoSS, expressed dissatisfaction with the implementation of the CPA 
and blamed the NCP for moving slowly and failing to resolve such key 
issues as the Abyei boundary, the North-South border, and 
transparency in the oil sector.  He did, however, acknowledge an 
improvement in NCP/SPLM relations.  Kiir also reiterated the 
GoSS/SPLM position supporting deployment of UN troops to Darfur, 
which the NCP opposes. 
 
¶4. (U) The governor of Central Equatoria (Bahr Al Jebel) State, 
Major Gen. Clement Wani Konga, announced during the celebration that 
he would be leaving the NCP and officially joining the SPLM with his 
militia, the strongest in Central Equatoria.  Wani became governor 
under a power-sharing arrangement that gave the NCP two 
governorships in the south (the other NCP governor is in Upper Nile 
State), but he has been cooperating with the SPLM for more than a 
year and rumors had been circulating over his defection. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Cause of Garang's Death Retakes Center Stage 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) During her speech, Rebecca Garang announced that she did not 
accept the findings of the investigation into her husband's death, 
which ruled it pilot error.  She believes her husband was murdered 
and called for the GoSS to launch an expanded investigation.  The 
investigation commission was chaired by former Sudanese Vice 
President Abel Alier and included experts from Russia and the U.S.'s 
National Transportation and Safety Board (NTSB).  Abel Alier 
attended the memorial event as a speaker.

Rebecca Garang Raises Suspicions on Cause of Crash 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶6. (SBU) In a private meeting with CODEL Payne, Rebecca Garang was 
even more explicit.  She requested U.S. support for an investigation 
and indicated she would not accept any result other than the 
identification of her husband's killers.  She said that foul play is 
the only explanation for the fact that the pilots did not turn back 
when her husband expressed concern, as heard on the black box.  She 
also said the satellite photos of the crash site showed extra 
bodies, that the pilots may have committed suicide, and that 
increased chatter among Libyans and Egyptians, including Egyptian 
calls on the death before it was announced, indicate a wider 
conspiracy.  The widow called for everyone involved, including 
herself, to take a lie detector test.  She indicated that Kiir must 
support the renewed investigation or suffer the consequences. 
(Note:  CODEL Payne's meeting with Kiir is covered in reftel.  End 
note.) 
 
¶7. (SBU) She said that she had met and talked at length with the 
representative of the National Transportation Safety Board who 
participated in the investigative committee.  Congressman Payne 
observed that helicopters are normally among the safest modes of 
flight, but was otherwise noncommittal on the investigative 
process.
