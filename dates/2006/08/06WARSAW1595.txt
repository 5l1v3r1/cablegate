¶1.  SUMMARY: In July 2006, sixteen Polish Border Guards (BG) 
attended two weeks of airport/border security training at the 
Federal Air Marshal Training Facility in Atlantic City, NJ.  The 
Program provided Polish air marshals with the skills and 
capabilities necessary to provide security aboard Polish aircraft. 
The Polish BG and the U.S. Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS) both 
hope to continue this cooperation.  END SUMMARY 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Idea Stemmed From Bilateral Counter Terror Cooperation 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶2.  During the first session of the Polish-U.S. Joint Counter 
Terrorism Working Group (JCTWG) in the spring of 2005, the Polish 
Border Guard (BG) requested Embassy assistance to establish 
cooperation with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and 
the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to develop an 
aviation security system in Poland.  The Polish request stemmed from 
a revision of their law on Border Guards, which gave the BG complete 
responsibility for providing security both in airports and aboard 
aircraft flights originating in Poland (Reftel). Through diplomatic 
channels, Embassy Warsaw identified appropriate POCs in TSA/FAMS 
with which to initiate cooperation. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
U.S. FAMS Trained Polish BG in Best Practices 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  As a result of the BG's request, from July 17-28, sixteen Polish 
Border Guards received two weeks of training at the Federal Air 
Marshal Training Facility in Atlantic City, NJ. The Polish 
participants came form a special operations unit within the Border 
Guard.  This unit will provide security aboard aircraft operated by 
the Polish Airline LOT on high-risk flights, including those bound 
for the U.S.  A representative of the German Air Marshal Service 
also observed the training as, in the past, all Polish BG officers 
attended a six-week training course in Germany. 
 
¶4.  The Air Marshal training in Atlantic City consisted of several 
classroom presentations and numerous practical exercises on 
operational tactics and techniques used by U.S. air marshals aboard 
aircraft.  Classroom presentations covered information sharing 
systems, in-flight medical considerations, suicide terrorism and 
aircraft explosives countermeasures.  Practical exercises fell into 
three blocks: defensive measures, firearms and mission training; all 
exercises emphasized dealing with these incidents aboard aircraft. 
 
¶5.  The State Department's Office of Export Control and Related 
Border Security funded all travel, lodging and per diem for 16 BG 
officers and two interpreters.  FAMS provided instructors, training 
materials in Polish, air marshal uniforms and van transportation 
around Atlantic City.  FAMS also assigned two Polish-speaking air 
marshals to assist the group during the training.  The Polish BG was 
the first international group to bring their firearms for training 
and the first group from Europe to complete this training in the 
U.S. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
BG and FAMS look forward to future cooperation 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶6. During the graduation ceremony on July 28, U.S. and Polish 
officials expressed their willingness to continue cooperation.  Mr. 
Dennis Holley, FAMS Assistant Special Agent in Charge for 
International Liaison, expressed interest in continuing work between 
the Polish BG and FAMS. The Director of the Federal Air Marshal 
Training Center, Mr. Joseph D'Angelillio, offered future assistance 
in joint trainings organized either in U.S. or in Poland at the 
soon-to-be established air marshal training facility in Ketrzyn, 
Poland.  Major Slawomir Gasior, the head of the Special Operations 
Unit of the BG, expressed interest in signing a bilateral agreement 
with USG that would allow Polish air marshals to fly with their 
firearms to U.S. destinations. 
 
¶7. COMMENT: The just-finished air marshal training for Polish Border 
Guard stands as a concrete benefit of the Polish-U.S. Joint Counter 
Terrorism Working Group (JCTWG) managed by U.S. Embassy Warsaw and 
the Polish Ministry of Interior.  The JCTWG will continue to seek 
such opportunities to expand bilateral cooperation and enhance 
mutual security in the Global War on Terror.  END COMMENT.
