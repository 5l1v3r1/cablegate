¶1.  (SBU) On August 20, Econoff spoke with Humaid al-Maani, 
Deputy Director of the Under Secretary's office, Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs (MFA), regarding Omani government efforts to 
deliver humanitarian assistance to Lebanese government 
agencies.  Al-Maani remarked that the Omani government had 
arranged for 16 relief flights to Lebanon, either directly to 
Beirut or through Damascus.  The last flight departed for 
Beirut on August 15 with 40 tons of household items, 
blankets, and food.  Oman has also sent medical supplies to 
the Lebanese government at its request.  Al-Maani noted that 
the MFA had received another urgent diplomatic request from 
the Lebanese Embassy in Muscat on August 20 for additional 
medical supplies.  The MFA has not determined the total value 
of all items sent to Lebanon. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Al-Maani commented that the Omani government has 
not yet decided what further assistance will be provided for 
Lebanon, though he stressed that Oman will furnish as much 
assistance as it can.  The government-sponsored Oman 
Charitable Organization (OCO) continues to advertise for cash 
donations and in-kind assistance in Oman's daily Arabic and 
English newspapers.  Furthermore, the OCO, in association 
with a number of corporate sponsors, will hold a fund-raising 
dinner and auction on August 27 for further Lebanese relief 
efforts.
