REF: STATE 114605 
 
¶1.  (U) On July 14, poloff delivered reftel message to Elena 
Rafti, who covers the Balkans in the MFA's Division of 
Bilateral Affairs.  Rafti said that Cyprus largely agrees 
with U.S. policy in the Balkans, but differs slightly in its 
position on Kosovo.  The GOC feels the current timeline in 
Kosovo is too restrictive, but agrees that the protection of 
minorities is paramount. 
 
¶2.  (U) Poloff also delivered reftel message to Giorgos 
Christofidou, who covers Africa and Asia in the MFA's 
Division of Bilateral Affairs; he promised to convey the 
points to his director.  Finally, Charalambous Hadjisavvas, 
who covers the Middle East, commented on Israel's recent 
incursions into Lebanon.  He said that Israel was 
overreacting to the kidnapping of its soldiers and that its 
government was apparently trying to shore up support among 
the population.  He also commented that Hamas's transition to 
a political entity would take time and that the members of 
the Quartet should make active efforts to calm the situation.
