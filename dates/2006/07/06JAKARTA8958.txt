     ¶B. JAKARTA 8224 (OPENING OF TIMIKA TRIAL DEFERRED) 
     ¶C. JAKARTA 8114 (TRIAL OF TIMIKA SUSPECTS) 
 
¶1. (SBU) Anthonious Wamang, Agustinus Anggaibak and five 
other co-conspirators appeared in Jakarta Central Court on 
July 18 to face charges in connection with the 2002 murders 
of two Amcits in Timika, Papua.  The three-hour July 18 
session was administrative in nature, devoted to identifying 
the suspects and reading the charges.  Conoff, poloff, and 
POL assistant attended.  The defendants' lawyers were not 
present. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Wamang, charged with premeditated murder, refused to 
cooperate with the court.  He did not respond to the judge's 
request that he acknowledge his identity, and did not answer 
the charges against him. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Anggaibak and the other co-conspirators confirmed 
their identities, and nodded or said "I understand" when 
asked whether they understood the charges against them.  The 
Rev. Isak Onawame, charged as a co-conspirator, made a 
statement objecting to being tried in Jakarta.  The judge 
responded that he must register this objection in writing 
with the aid of his lawyer.  The judge also noted that the 
defendants' lawyers were not present, and said that the 
seriousness of the charges obliged the court to provide legal 
counsel for the next session if the defendants desired this. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Following these proceedings, the trial was adjourned 
until August 1.  The judge commented that in order to 
expedite the trial, she would consider holding sessions twice 
weekly after that point. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Many journalists attended the session.  A protestor 
in the courtroom raised her voice from time to time but was 
apparently not deemed disruptive enough to be removed.  There 
was a heavy police presence.
