     ¶B. ABIDJAN 778 
 
  ¶1. (SBU) As of late afternoon, roadblocks in the Abidjan 
districts of Riviera (where Embassy is located), Cocody, and 
Deux Plateaux, where most Embassy personnel reside, have been 
dismantled or shut down.  The airport remains open and we 
understand that Air France is flying tonight.  An Embassy 
vehicle traveled to the airport via back roads late this 
afternoon and reported no difficulty getting through although 
some of the roadblocks en route abandoned by the Young 
Patriots are now being manned by derelicts and opportunists 
looking for handouts.  There are reportedly some roadblocks 
still in place in the Yopougon area of Abidjan. 
 
¶2. (SBU) There are unconfirmed reports that the Young 
Patriots have pledged to man the barricades again tomorrow 
starting at 0600 to disrupt the scheduled meeting of the 
International Working Group (IWG).  No confirmation yet as to 
whether the IWG will in fact meet.  We will review the 
security situation again early tomorrow morning before start 
of workday.
