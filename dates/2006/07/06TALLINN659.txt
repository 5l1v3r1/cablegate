¶1. (SBU) Summary.  Deputy European Correspondent Kristel 
Kase told us on June 14 that the June GAERC meeting 
would be dominated by the recent escalation of violence 
in Lebanon and Gaza (with Iraq and Bosnia being bumped 
from the agenda to free up more time).  Kase also 
briefed us on the Council's pre-Gaerc discussions on 
Sudan, Congo, Macedonia, Kosovo, and the WTO.  End 
Summary. 
 
Middle East and Africa 
---------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) The GOE condemns the current violence in 
Lebanon and Gaza, and encourages all partners to return 
to the negotiation table.  The Council will adopt 
separate Conclusions that will most likely follow the 
Finnish Presidency declaration on Israel's need to 
restrain itself with a more "proportionate use of 
force."  On Iran, Kase said that the Council would adopt 
Conclusions, though no text has been circulated as 
everyone was waiting for the G8 Conclusions. 
 
¶4. (SBU) On Sudan, the GOE now supports transferring 
AMIS responsibilities to the UN.  Estonia has also 
increased its own bilateral humanitarian aid to Sudan 
over the last three years, and will increase its aid to 
800,000 EEK ($64,000) for Darfur refugees this year.  On 
the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kase said that the GOE 
will support the EU's election observation team by 
sending one long-term and two to three mid-term election 
monitors. 
 
Balkans

¶2. (SBU) On Macedonia, the GOE supports the EU common 
position, and will press for progress on a Community 
Treaty on energy security.  However, Kase said that the 
GOE hopes that the Government of Macedonia will continue 
with its much needed reforms.  On Kosovo, the GOE 
continues to support UN Special Envoy Ahtisaari.  As the 
EU will be expanding its role in Kosovo, Kase said that 
it is "crucial for the Serbs and the Albanians to agree 
on the way forward." 
 
 
WTO 
--- 
 
¶5. (SBU) EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson will give 
a "state-of-play" presentation to the Council.  The GOE 
fully supports the Commission's position, but said that 
Estonia would support an extraordinary GAERC meeting on 
the matter if needed to ensure Doha's success.  While 
Estonia still hopes for an agreement, there is a real 
sense that failure is becoming likelier as time passes.
