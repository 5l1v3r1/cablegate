SUBJECT:  Friday Prayers Address U.S. Condemnation of Kordofan 
Attack and North Korean Missiles 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  July 7 prayers at a Khartoum mosque praised U.S. 
condemnation of the July 3 rebel attack in Hamra al-Sheikh in 
Kordofan, yet linked the response to perceived U.S. apprehensions 
arising from North Korean missiles and a purported shift in the 
world balance of power.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On July 7, pro-Government, state-run Omdurman Sudan 
Television in Arabic broadcasted Friday prayers at the Al-Shahid 
(Martyr's) Mosque in Khartoum offered by Al-Shaykh Abd-al-Jalil 
al-Nadhir al-Karuri.  He included in his second sermon the following 
remarks, as translated and reported by FBIS:

The news of this week says sometimes the superpower understands the 
truth and knows fear.  To know the truth is what was announced by 
the U.S. State Department, condemning the military attack by rebels 
on Hamrat al-Shaykh town in Kordofan.  They condemned the act and 
said that it violates the agreements (Darfur Peace Agreement), which 
was witnessed by the world, it violates the peace which people have 
agreed upon and appealed to them (rebels) not to violate the 
agreement. We praise this recognition of truth by them (U.S. State 
Department). 
 
Their recognition of fear emanates from the fact that North Korea 
has manufactured a continental missile reaching 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, 
4,000 kilometers, shaking all the countries.  It shakes the 
countries leading a campaign to become imperial states in the world. 
 As they are being threatened by what they used to refer to as Third 
World country. 
 
They are fearing because they had tried sanctions against it and 
failed, because other countries in Asia opposed it.  Thus, the Cold 
War has been revived and now it is between the West and Asia. 
Because the Asian countries as a group have defended the missile 
issue and it should not lead into an embargo. 
 
They have made South Korea to sleep and its buses both the big and 
the small ones are full in Khartoum streets. The North (Korea) is 
developing and its advancement is not in building cars and buses but 
missiles which brought about a balance (of power) in the world.
