¶1. (SBU)  Poloff delivered reftel demarche July 19 to Sergey 
Tarasov, Caribbean Section Chief in the MFA Latin America 
Department.  Tarasov said he would pass the information to 
his superiors but could not predict whether Russia would 
provide any assistance to Haiti.  He was aware of the High 
Level International Meeting in Brazil on May 23 but was 
unaware that the GOH intended to hold a Donors' Conference 
July 25 or where it would take place.  Tarasov said Russia 
covers Haiti from its embassy in Caracas. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Tarasov agreed that international assistance to the 
GOH was very important, but stressed that the Haitian people 
and government were not well served by relying on such aid. 
Good governance and anti-corruption initiatives were 
paramount.  In Moscow's view, the situation in Haiti had 
improved somewhat since the beginning of this year, but 
Tarasov said that was mostly due to the efforts of the UN 
mission.  Russia had shown its commitment to that effort by 
dispatching at the end of last year eight civilian police 
officers, who Tarasov thought would remain in Haiti until the 
end of the mission's mandate.  Moscow might send an 
additional two officers depending on the circumstances.
