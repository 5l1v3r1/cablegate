SUBJECT: BEIJING WILL SERIOUSLY CONSIDER THE GLOBAL 
INITIATIVE TO COMBAT NUCLEAR TERRORISM 
 
REF: STATE 110160 
 
¶1. (SBU) China attaches great importance to the Global 
Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism and will study the 
presidential announcement carefully, stated Assistant Foreign 
Minister Cui Tiankai.  In response to the joint presentation 
of reftel points on July 7 by the DCM and the Russian Charge 
d'affairs Igor Morgulova, Cui said that Beijing will continue 
to promote with strong determination the fight against 
terrorism and will respond promptly to the U.S.-Russian 
initiative.  The DCM urged the PRC to issue a general 
statement of support for the initiative shortly after it is 
publicly announced, stressing that with a statement from 
China the initiative would gain traction in the international 
community.  The Russian Charge stated that Russia and the 
United States would be pleased if China could support the 
initiative and hope that China will agree to be a founding 
member of the Global Initiative. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Cui pointed out that China supports UNSC Resolutions 
on targeting terrorism and endorsed the UN Secretary 
General's report on the global fight against terrorism. 
China, the United States and Russia are permanent members of 
the UNSC and share a heavy responsibility for stopping 
terrorism and maintaining world peace, Cui said.  As victims 
of terrorist acts, it is imperative that the three countries 
strengthen cooperation in fighting terrorism.  Positive 
progress has been made in China-U.S. and China-Russia 
bilateral efforts to combat terrorism and Beijing hopes that 
intensified efforts to fight terrorism can be made in the 
bilateral, trilateral and multilateral arenas. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Cui raised two administrative questions regarding 
the initiative: first, will the initiative be included as 
part of the G-8 agenda and, second, where and at what level 
will the proposed October 2006 meeting be held?  The DCM 
responded that the initiative will be presented as a 
bilateral effort and is not part of the G-8 Summit.  The 
Russian Charge added that President Bush and President Putin 
will make the announcement on the eve of the St. Petersburg 
G-8 summit.  The DCM proposed that working-level contacts be 
established between the three parties to continue the 
discussion of the initiative and said that the United States 
is prepared to respond rapidly and work closely with the PRC 
and Russia on this issue.  Cui agreed, stating that it is 
important to maintain close coordination and cooperation on 
this issue.
