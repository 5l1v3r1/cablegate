SUBJECT: INDONESIA PASSES LAW ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF ACEH 
 
¶1. Summary:  The Indonesian National Parliament late on July 
11 passed the long awaited Law on the Administration of Aceh. 
 The passage was welcomed by the Aceh Monitoring Mission, 
which is meeting with the parties to the Memorandum of 
Understanding of August 15, 2005 before offering its 
assessment of the law.  Post is examining the provisions of 
the new law and will provide a more thorough analysis in the 
near future.  End summary. 
 
¶2. The new Law on the Administration of Aceh was passed by 
the Indonesian National Parliament (DPR) late in the day on 
July 11 in Jakarta.  All eleven parties in the lower house 
approved the bill, indicating a broad consensus of support 
within Indonesia as a whole, if not also within Aceh.  This 
consensus included the Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), 
which had been the most outspoken opponent of Acehnese 
autonomy, and the United Development Party (PPP), which has 
broad support within Aceh.  Initial assessments by political 
observers suggest that, while a range of constituencies and 
NGOs remain dissatisfied with specific provisions of the law, 
it is likely to stand and can serve as a basis for general 
elections in Aceh later this year.  The law will be formally 
presented to the government of Aceh on July 13.  President 
Yudhoyono must sign the law within 15 days if he wishes to 
endorse it; otherwise the law automatically takes effect 
within 30 days of its passage.  There have been a number of 
contradictory statements about the law and its congruence 
with the Memorandum of Understanding of August 15, 2005. 
However, although the GAM has yet to discuss the law 
formally, some GAM leaders have stated that the law is for 
the most part consistent with the MOU. 
 
¶3. The Aceh Monitoring Mission (AMM) issued a brief statement 
on July 11, shortly after the law,s passage, welcoming the 
DPR,s decision as the product of a democratic process and as 
a step furthering the peace process begun by the August, 2005 
MOU.  The AMM said that it plans to consult with the parties 
to the MOU, including a meeting in Banda Aceh on July 12, 
which was to be followed by a press conference. 
 
¶4. We obtained a copy of the law ahead of its official 
promulgation late on July 12 and will offer a more thorough 
analysis of its contents, as well as its public reception, in 
the near future.
