(SBU) MFA Nonproliferation Office Director Filippo Formica 
told PolOff Italy was fully aware of the contents of the P5 1 
package, noting that Italy had contributed its thoughts on 
the package in previous meetings with U/S Burns and had been 
kept informed of the negotiations through G8 discussions. 
Formica agreed that Iran must accept the contents of the 
package or face UN sanctions.  Formica thanked the U.S. for 
keeping Italy informed and providing opportunities for 
bilateral discussions on this important issue.  Pol MC also 
shared points with MFA Director General for the Mediterranean 
and Middle East Riccardo Sessa.  Sessa said they would study 
our points carefully and "begin working on it right away."
