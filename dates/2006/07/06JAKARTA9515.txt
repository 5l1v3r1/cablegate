from the NAMRU-2 and the Ministry of Health (MOH) show 56 
cases of avian influenza with 44 confirmed deaths.  End 
Summary. 
 
Minister of Health Praises USG Collaboration 
--------------------------------------------- 
¶2. (SBU) Minister of Health Dr. Siti Fadilah Supari told the 
Ambassador on July 24 that the GOI is pleased with USG 
collaboration on various health challenges such as avian 
influenza (AI) and polio.  She thanked USAID and NAMRU-2 for 
their support.  The Ambassador conveyed his appreciation for 
the Ministry's cooperation and transparency shown in 
combating avian influenza in the human population but noted 
his continued concern about the Ministry of Agriculture's 
lack of effectiveness in controlling the disease in the 
animal population.  He emphasized that good cooperation and 
sharing of samples will be crucial to managing the AI 
challenge.  The Ambassador explained that AI in Indonesia is 
being closely followed in Washington.  He noted that USAID 
is finalizing the $11.5 million in assistance promised by 
Secretary Rice in March 2006 and that the USG will continue 
 
SIPDIS 
to provide other technical assistance from the Centers for 
Disease Control, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Singaporean Ministry of Health Team Discusses Tangerang 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) A team from the Singaporean Ministry of Health met 
with GOI officials on July 24 and discussed the trilateral 
Tangerang pilot program, according to a Singaporean Embassy 
source.  The team had separate meetings with Dr. Bayu 
Krisnamutki, Dr. I. Nyoman Kandun, and unnamed officials at 
DEPLU (Ministry of Foreign Affairs).  The source noted that 
a letter of intent (LOI) between the Singaporean Government 
and GOI has not been finalized, but that the two governments 
continue to develop a draft.  During the meeting with the 
Singaporeans, Bayu expressed interest in pursuing a "soft 
launch" for Tangerang, independent of finalization of LOIs 
between the three governments.  Bayu mentioned three 
potential areas for Singapore and USG collaboration: a) 
training for diagnostics in Tangerang; b) workshop for 
 
JAKARTA 00009515  002.2 OF 003 
 
 
dealing with AI victims; c) implementation of a public 
awareness campaign. 
 
MOH Finalizes CDC Application for Funds 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) The Indonesian Ministry of Health is finalizing its 
application for funds through the CDC RFA CI06-607 to 
support its AI program.  The MOH will be proposing 
activities under all three pillars of the President's 
National Strategy.  Under "Preparedness and Communication" 
(Pillar 1), the MOH will identify, train and support 
Government spokespersons at national, provincial and 
district levels; and will also distribute avian influenza 
prevention, treatment, and surveillance guidelines to health 
workers at all levels throughout the country.  Under 
"Surveillance and Detection" (Pillar 2), the MOH proposes to 
complement the contributions being made by USAID to 
implement Integrated (human & animal) Disease Surveillance 
and Community-based Surveillance for AI.  Under "Response 
and Containment" (Pillar 3), the MOH will focus on 
establishing, training and supporting national, provincial 
and district Rapid Response Teams. 
 
Human AI Case Profile 
---------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) The CDC confirmed H5N1 infection in a 44-year-old 
male from East Jakarta who died in Jakarta on July 12, 
raising the number of confirmed deaths to 44.  This case had 
previously been identified by NAMRU-2 and the NIHRD 
(National Institute of Health Research and Development) 
laboratory in Jakarta.  The media in Jakarta reported that 
Indonesia has overtaken Vietnam and now leads the world in 
number of human deaths.  NAMRU-2 reports no new probable 
cases since last reftel.  NAMRU-2 data indicates the 
following AI-related case profile as of July 27: 
 
-- Number of laboratory confirmed (positive PCR and/or 
serology) human AI cases: 56, of which 44 have been fatal 
(case fatality rate of 79 percent). 
 
-- Number of probable AI cases (awaiting WHO Laboratory 
confirmation): 4, with 2 deaths (fatality rate of 50 
percent). 
 
-- Number of cases awaiting verification by the US CDC:0. 
 
-- Number of possible AI untested cases under investigation 
(last 30 days): approximately 9. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Note: NAMRU-2 data corresponds with Ministry of 
Health data but may vary at times with AI case figures 
presented on the official World Health Organization (WHO) 
website, which usually lags NAMRU-2 data by one week.  The 
WHO website (last updated on July 26) currently notes 54 
human AI cases in Indonesia with 42 deaths. WHO figures can 
be accessed at www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza.
