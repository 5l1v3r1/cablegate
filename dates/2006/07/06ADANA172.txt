between 40 and 75 have been sentenced to 10 months of 
imprisonment for undertaking actions for improving prison 
conditions and demanding a general amnesty. The group has been 
charged with making "separatist propaganda." These women had 
blocked a road in Diyarbakir and had displayed a banner reading 
"Mr. Ocalan is our political will power" on February 22, 2006. 
 
ULKEDE OZGUR GUNDEM: Sirin Bagli, an administrator at DTP 
provincial office of Batman, was put in custody while traveling 
from Batman to Diyarbakir during a road check on the ground that

the Anti-terror office of the Batman Security Directorate and 
his house has also been searched by police.

force after being published in the official gazette. The 
government gave "political instructions" to the army for a 
cross-border operation in northern Iraq. Annual leaves for the 
army has been annulled and more troops and military equipment 
have been amassed along the border. Special Operations Team 
members have been deployed in city centers. Opposition parties 
have been supporting a cross border operation. Non-governmental 
Organizations expressed their reaction and urged the government 
to solve the problems through democratic means. Mazlumder's 
National President Ozkaya said that a cross-border operation 
would cause faults within the country while KESK -Public 
Employees' Union- President Tombul said an operation at Kandil 
Mountain in northern Iraq would not be the solution to the 
problem.
