ATTENDANCE 
 
REF: STATE 112656 
 
Despite several inquiries (the most recent on July 31), the 
MFA and Presidency have not been able to provide the likely 
composition of France's 2006 UNGA delegation.  An MFA contact 
said on July 31 that the issue would not likely be decided 
before mid-August, at the earliest.  Past practice would 
suggest attendance by President Chirac in addition to FM 
Douste-Blazy.  (In September 2005, PM de Villepin was named 
as a replacement for President Chirac shortly before the UNGA 
as a result of the latter's hospitalization.)  We will report 
this year's high-level GOF attendees as soon as that 
information is made available to us.
