STATEMENT 
 
REF: SECSTATE 114848 
 
Classified By: PolCouns Kathy Fitzpatrick for reasons 
1.4 (b) & (d). 
 
(C/NF) Poloff discussed reftel demarche with MFA deputy DG 
for Mexico, Central America, and Caribbean Carmen Diez on 
July 18.  Diez accepted the demarche points, but was unaware 
of the draft statement.  After reviewing the situation with 
the Spanish embassy in Managua, she said that Spain would 
stick with the EU consensus on this issue.  Diez said that 
Spain is committed to supporting democracy in Latin America 
and to making the upcoming Nicaraguan elections successful. 
She said, however, that the EU members have agreed that it is 
too early to issue such a statement. Spain prefers to take a 
lower profile for now, waiting to see what happens and 
avoiding "excessively public" involvement like the draft 
statement.
