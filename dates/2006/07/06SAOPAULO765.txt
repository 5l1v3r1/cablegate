SUBJECT: REDUCED VIOLENCE IN SAO PAULO NIGHT OF JULY 12, BUS 
PROBLEMS ON JULY 13 
 
REFS:  A) Sao Paulo 761 and Previous  B) Sao Paulo 762 
 
¶1.  Sao Paulo and neighboring cities again suffered attacks the 
night of July 12/morning of July 13 from the organized criminal gang 
First Capital Command (PCC), though at a reduced level compared to 
the previous night.  Two deaths from July 12 were reported, though 
apparently no one was killed in night attacks.  More police stations 
were attacked, and assaults against civilian targets continued 
(buses, supermarkets, banks, gasoline station, even an ambulance). 
Bus burnings, which injured five persons, stranded thousands of 
commuters as bus companies withheld their vehicles from the streets; 
several of our GSO and Maintenance employees had difficulty making 
it to work on time.  Bus transportation problems continued 
throughout the day of July 13, though most businesses operated 
normally. 
 
¶2.  News sources reported up to 106 attacks against 121 targets 
throughout the state from the night of July 11 through noon July 13. 
 The following is the reported tally of the violence during this 
period: 
 
-- Eight dead: in addition to the six deaths reported in ref A, a 
prison guard was shot in Campinas on July 12 while escorting 
prisoners and died later, and a municipal guard was shot in the head 
while making rounds at a school in Cabreuva.  There were no reported 
deaths overnight. 
 
-- At least 25 police/Municipal Guard facilities were attacked 
throughout the greater metro area, usually drive-by shootings. 
 
-- At least 68 buses were burned or shot up in locations scattered 
throughout the greater metro area and Santos. 
 
-- 12 bank agencies were burned (five Bradesco locations 
overnight). 
 
-- Four supermarkets (two more overnight). 
 
-- Various:  three used car dealerships, a gasoline station 
(fortunately, the bomb failed to detonate), an ambulance (lured out 
with a fake distress call), and the office of the state youth 
corrections system; all of these attacks represent new targets for 
the PCC. 
 
¶3.  Comment:  The intensity of the attacks appears to have 
diminished, though transportation remained problematic throughout 
the day.  Septel will report comments made by Sao Paulo State 
Governor Claudio Lembo during a lunch with consulate officers.  Post 
held an Emergency Action Committee meeting (ref B) and will continue 
to monitor the situation closely. End Comment.
