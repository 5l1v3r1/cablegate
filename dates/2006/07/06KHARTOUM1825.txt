SUBJECT:  SUDAN/DARFUR:  CFC Meeting in El Fasher 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  On July 26, the Darfur Ceasefire Commission (CFC) 
met in El Fasher, Darfur.  Para 2 presents the notes of the U.S. CFC 
Representative.  Noteworthy is the announcement by SLM/Minawi that 
they are now boycotting CFC meetings due to lack of support from the 
AU -- see septel for litany of SLA/Minnawi complaints.  End summary. 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) The U.S. Representative's notes are as follows: 
 
The Ceasefire Commission held a regularly scheduled meeting on 
Wednesday, July 26 at AMIS FHQ in El Fasher.  The meeting was 
attended by all parties, except for the noticeable absence of a 
representative of SLA/Minawi.  The Force Commander (FC) notified the 
assembled Commission that SLM/Minawi had phoned the CFC before the 
meeting to say that they were boycotting CFC meetings.  According to 
the CFC Secretary, who took the call, SLM/Minawi is dissatisfied 
with a lack of response from AMIS to their letter requesting 
additional funding and provisioning for SLM/Minawi members involved 
in the peace process. 
 
This is the second CFC meeting in a row that SLM/Minawi has not 
attended.  The FC ended the Monday, July 24 meeting without 
discussion of violations due to the absence of an SLM/Minawi rep. 
At the Wednesday meeting both the U.S. and UN Observers urged the FC 
to continue the meeting, which the FC did. 
 
The CFC listened to a series of complaints of armed individuals, 
identified as SLM/Minawi soldiers, who have been entering the Zam 
Zam IDP camp during the past couple of weeks.  These complaints were 
filed by AMIS CIVPOL at Zam Zam.  The soldiers, who say they are 
visiting relatives in the camp, have been disregarding DPA 
protocols, which do not permit arms in the IDP camps.  The CFC 
agreed that the entrance of any party into an IDP camp is a 
violation of the DPA, and condemned the actions of the soldiers at 
Zam Zam.  The CFC reiterated that the proper procedure for armed 
individuals to enter a camp requires them to contact the nearest 
AMIS MGS, leave their weapons behind and receive an escort into the 
camp. 
 
The FC solicited comments from the CFC concerning the Draft 
Janjaweed Disarmament Plan that the CFC was given at the Monday 
meeting.  At the Monday, July 24 meeting the U.S. Representative 
noted that giving the CFC members only two days to review the plan 
gave little or no time for members to properly consult with their 
headquarters or capitals -- a comment that fell on deaf ears.  In 
any event, the members were polled for comments.  The U.S. and UN 
Representatives provided the bulk of comments on the plan.  The FC 
indicated that there will be ample time for comments/modifications 
as the plan moves forward. 
 
The U.S. and UN Representatives requested that in future meetings 
members be provided advance copies of alleged violations that will 
be discussed at CFC meetings.  The FC agreed to the request. 
 
The next meeting of the Darfur CFC is scheduled for Monday, July 31 
at 1030 in the CFC Conference Room at Force HQ in El Fasher.
