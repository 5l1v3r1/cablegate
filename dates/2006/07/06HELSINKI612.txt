Begin text. 
Thank you very much for your message, inviting our comments 
to NTIA's request for comments.  I'm happy to inform you 
that during the first week of the Finnish presidency of the 
EU, a troika (Finland, Germany, Commission) meeting 
concerning internet governance issues in the post-WSIS 
situation will be held in Washington DC with high-level 
participation from both DOS and DOC.  Finnish participants 
will be Ms. Kristiina Pietikainen from the Ministry of 
Transport and Communications, and myself.  That meeting 
will no doubt discuss also the issues raised the RFC.  I 
don't expect we will be able to present an EU answer to the 
seven questions included in the RFC, but at least this 
important meeting will be a step towards it.
