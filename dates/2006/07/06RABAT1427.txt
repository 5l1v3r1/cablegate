¶1.  (U) This cable is sensitive but unclassified. Please 
protect accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Per reftel, Poloffs met July 27 with MFA Bilateral 
Affairs and Counterterrorism officer Karim Halim to encourage 
the Government of Morocco (GOM) to replace its existing 505 
agreement with the text of a new agreement, which poloffs 
provided to Halim via diplomatic note number 257.  Poloffs 
stressed that Morocco will be unable to receive training or 
equipment unless it agrees to provide end-use, retransfer and 
security assurances to defense articles and services pursuant 
to section 1206 authority, explained that our current 
agreement does not provide these assurances, and outlined the 
necessary steps the GOM must take in order to enter into a 
new agreement. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In response, Halim asked several questions 
including would the new agreement mean that Morocco must seek 
USG authorization every time it trained a non-Moroccan in the 
framework of the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Initiative 
(TSCTI) using US equipment.  He said he would transmit the 
new agreement text to the MFA's Legal Affairs Division and 
other concerned government offices for review, noting that 
the GOM could propose amendments to this text, which he 
explained is normal and logical in any agreement.  He also 
said that the Moroccan response will likely be in French and 
Arabic according to GOM standard practice.  Halim thanked 
Poloffs for the information and pledged to contact the 
Embassy when the appropriate GOM officials have reviewed the 
new agreement text, which he mentioned could be "several 
months."  Post will coordinate with the Department per reftel 
should the MFA response note propose changes to the proposed 
text in diplomatic note number 257 or if it is written in a 
language other than English.
