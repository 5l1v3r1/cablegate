REF: STATE 109771; YAMAMOTO-WHITNEY E-MAIL 06/24/06 (NOTAL) 
 
¶1. (U) Following is an update on the status of New Zealand's efforts 
regarding the HSPD-6 initiative: 
 
¶2. (SBU) The New Zealand Security Intelligence Service (NZSIS), 
which is the lead agency for the HSPD-6 initiative in New Zealand, 
is continuing to review the draft agreement.  Because the agreement 
is a memorandum of understanding and not a treaty, it will not 
require Cabinet or government approval.  NZSIS hopes its director 
will approve and then send a memorandum on the initiative to the 
Prime Minister's office the week of July 17, which then would allow 
negotiations to begin on the agreement.  NZSIS acknowledged a delay 
in completion of the memorandum, which it had hoped to finish in 
June (ref B). 
 
¶3. (SBU) NZSIS noted that the initiative has broad agreement among 
officials in the government, including NZSIS, police, immigration 
and customs.  However, while NZSIS considers an agreement to be 
achievable, it faces a tough challenge in obtaining funding to 
implement the initiative.  The agency will need funding for computer 
hardware, to provide 24-hours, seven-days-a-week staffing, and to 
increase staff at the New Zealand Embassy in Washington.  NZSIS is 
relatively optimistic it will obtain the additional funding.  If 
difficulties arise, it will notify post. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Beginning July 14, Embassy's point of contact on this 
initiative will be Acting DCM Katherine B. Hadda, telephone 
64-4-462-6063; fax 64-4-472-3537; e-mail address 
haddaKB2@state.gov.
