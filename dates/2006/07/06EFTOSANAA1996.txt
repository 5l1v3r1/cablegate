SUBJECT: ELECTIONS: CHARGE PRESSES FREEDOM AGENDA WITH 
PRESIDENT SALEH 
 
¶1. (SBU/NF)  SUMMARY:  In an unexpected meeting called by 
Saleh to discuss other issues (septel) on July 11, Charge 
pressed Saleh on respecting the June agreement of principles 
signed by the ruling party and the opposition.  Charge 
particularly emphasized that equal access to government-owned 
media was not being implemented.  Saleh defended himself by 
saying it was natural for the media to cover him more because 
of his official duties as Chief of State.  He further noted 
that the fact that 64 Yemenis had applied to the Parliament 
to be presidential candidates was a clear sign of the ROYG's 
commitment to democracy.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2. (SBU/NF)  At the end of a discussion that covered a wide 
range of topics, Charge took the opportunity to tell Saleh 
that implementation of the agreement reached between the 
ruling party and the main opposition coalition in June is 
important.  He pointed out that one of the principles agreed 
to -- equal access to government owned media, particularly 
broadcast outlets -- is not being respected.  Yemeni TV, 
which has a monopoly on non-satellite broadcasts in Yemen, 
airs long presidential speeches, Charge said, but accords 
only a few moments to opposition candidates. 
 
¶3. (SBU/NF)  Saleh disagreed, saying that it was only natural 
for the media to cover him more, because he is the President, 
and carries out official duties, including the recent visit 
he made to countries around the region.  Charge replied that 
this was not a valid argument, since this is an election 
season, and every speech the President gives, no matter the 
occasion, has political content.  The main opposition 
candidates should be given the same opportunity to make their 
points. 
 
¶4. (SBU/NF)  The President then asked one of his advisors to 
bring in a current copy of the government daily "Al-Thawra," 
which he opened to a page showing photographs of all 64 
Yemenis who had submitted applications to Parliament to run 
for the presidency.  Displaying it to the Charge, he said, 
"This is democracy -- there are even several women running. 
In the United States, you only have two candidates, and we 
have 64!" 
 
¶5. (SBU/NF)  COMMENT:  The tone of the meeting was 
light-hearted, but President Saleh received the Charge's 
message, which we have repeated at all levels of the ROYG and 
in a recent media statement, that the international community 
will be watching to see if the ROYG respects the agreement 
reached between the two main parties in order to give fair 
and transparent elections a chance. 
 
¶6. (SBU/NF)  COMMENT CONTINUED:  Government media outlets 
certainly have progress to make in this regard. 
"Al-Thawra's" June 25 edition dedicated virtually all of its 
26 pages to Saleh's nomination "by acclimation," and even 
added a 24-page insert filled with full-page ads from various 
organizations thanking Saleh for accepting the nomination. 
Yemeni TV and radio followed roughly the same script.  The 
main opposition candidate, by contrast, received only a 
four-by-six inch, below-the-fold mention in "Al-Thawra" and 
virtually no TV coverage.  Post will continue to press this 
point and others related to the elections, particularly after 
Parliament gives its final approval to the list of candidates 
-- which we expect to number no more than three or four.
