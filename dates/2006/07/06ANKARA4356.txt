REF: ANKARA 4163 (EXDIS) AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1. (SBU) This is another in a series of periodic reports on 
PKK violence in Turkey (see reftels).  Our primary sources 
for these reports are mainstream Turkish press services, such 
as the Anatolian News Agency, and international wire 
services.  While these sources are more reliable than most 
Turkish press sources, they are not necessarily 
unimpeachable.  Press services sympathetic to the PKK, such 
as Neu-Isenburg People's Defense Forces and Firat News 
Agency, tend to report higher numbers of Turkish Security 
Forces casualties. 
 
¶2. (U) According to press reports, two members of the Turkish 
Security Forces were killed and eight were wounded over the 
period July 17 - July 23.  One civilian was killed.  This 
number of PKK-related casualties is more typical than the 
high level observed during the second week of July (reftel). 
Fourteen PKK terrorists were killed and twelve were arrested 
during clashes with Turkish forces during the same period.
