¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  The UN and international partners are optimistic 
following the conclusion of the first round of talks in Asmara 
between the Eastern Front and Sudanese Government under Eritrean 
mediation.  The signing of the Declaration of Principles and 
Cessation of Hostilities agreement were good first steps; the 
parties agreed to reconvene on July 17, though the date may be 
pushed to late July.  A matteR of some$concmrn o Our i.terjatkonal

n9&`-QQhe absence of 
international observers in Hamesh Koreib.  The UN has lost all 
access to the area, and concern is rising that retributive attacks 
may be occurring.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 "Friends of the Mediation" to Provide Tech Assistance 
¶2. (SBU) Pol Officer recently participated in a small group 
discussion on developments in Eastern Sudan involving 
representatives from UNMIS, OCHA, the UK, Norway, the Netherlands, 
and Canada.  In spite of the decision not to permit third party 
observers into the talks, Eritrea has expressed support for the 
creation of a "Friends of the Mediation" group, which would provide 
ad hoc technical assistance.  In particular, there is a growing 
consensus that a consultative component is vital to success of the 
talks.  The parties appear to agree that dialogue within affected 
communities is necessary prior to the signing of an agreement.  A 
meeting took place in Tessaney, Eritrea, during the first week of 
July to discuss standing up and funding this consultative mechanism. 
 Some members of the donor community, including the Norwegians and 
British, have said they plan to attend.  Though the parties would 
not pose any objection to international funding for the 
consultations, this will not likely provoke movement on their 
unwillingness to allow third-party observers to the talks. 
 
UN:  Situation in Hamesh Koreib Remains Tenuous 
¶3. (SBU) Separately, indications are the situation in Eastern Sudan 
may be more tenuous than is apparent from media reports.  The recent 
withdrawal of SPLA forces from Hamesh Koreib and turnover to Kassala 
State authorities was met with positive reactions from the 
international community, UN, and media, but since that time there 
has been very little information emerging from the town.  UNMIS is 
increasingly concerned the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) may move into 
Hamesh Koreib soon and the absence of observers may permit targeting 
of civilians.  Though UNMIS, other UN agencies, and NGOs previously 
had obtained greater freedom of movement in the East for the 
delivery of humanitarian supplies, the Sudanese Government has 
recently re-imposed travel restrictions, including on WFP.  This has 
blocked most travel outside Port Sudan and Kassala.  Prior to the 
restrictions, WFP had delivered sufficient supplies to areas outside 
these cities for one month, but supplies will run out in the near 
future. 
 
Hamesh Koreib a SAF "Area of Operations" 
¶4. (SBU) The only recent visit to Hamesh Koreib was by the 
International Rescue Committee (IRC), which reported that the town 
has been declared an "Area of Operations" by the SAF.  The issue is 
further complicated by allegations that approximately 3,000 SPLA 
"deserters" remain in the vicinity, and were not part of the general 
withdrawal.
