¶1. (U) By evening 7/21 local time, Mission Turkey will have 
staffed up in Mersin and Incirlik Air Base to accommodate 
AmCits evacuating Lebanon.  As of 7/22 we will be capable of 
processing the 1400 pax expected on the Rahmah.  We 
understand TDY consular and management assistance is en 
route; we very much appreciate the help.  Incirlik staff and 
facilities are well able to accommodate evacuee needs.  Fully 
staffed, we will be able to handle 2000-2500/day. 
 
¶2. (U) Arrivals:  Late 7/20, 24 AmCits, 4 green card holders 
and one Lebanese with 2 AmCit children arrived in Mersin on a 
Canadian-chartered fast ferry.  We understand that two more 
Canadian-chartered ferries will arrive between 2100-2300 
local 7/21, followed by two high speed catamarans.  We are 
not aware at this point that any AmCits are on board, but 
will continue to be in touch with Canadian colleagues and are 
prepared in the event Amcits are on board.  We expect the 
arrival late afternoon/early evening 7/22 local time of the 
Rahmah with approximately 1400 Amcits on board. 
 
¶3. (U) Outbound flights:  We understand chartered aircraft 
will arrive at Incirlik July 22 and 23 with capacity to 
transport the 1400 expected evacuees.  Additional charter 
capacity will be essential as subsequent vessels arrive in 
Mersin so we do not exceed 2000-2500 on Incirlik at any one 
time. 
 
¶4. (U) Visa requirements and customs issues:  To the extent 
it is possible, in advance of debarkation, to get passenger 
manifests with names, passport numbers, dob and nationality, 
it will greatly facilitate Turkish customs/passport 
formalities.  We are working with GOT officials to plus up 
the number of customs officials at portside for arrival, as 
well as at Incirlik for departure. 
 
¶5. (U) Crisis Action Team (CAT):  As of 1730 local 7/21, 
Embassy Ankara will have a CAT room staffed 24/7 to deal with 
incoming task force calls and other evacuation-related 
issues.  Embassy number:  90-312-455-5555, ext 2173 or 2174; 
fax:  90-312-468-6138; opennet e-mail address collective: 
ankara-cat-dl@state.gov.  Please include this e-mail 
collective on any communications relating to the evacuation. 
 
¶6. (U) TSA requirements:  Incirlik reports they are getting 6 
Air Marshals and that their port PAX terminal is fully 
compliant and capable of screening luggage and processing for 
the onward movement.
