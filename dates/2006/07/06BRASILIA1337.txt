¶1.  (U)  This cable was coordinated with Brazil's DEA Country 
Office. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Summary.  In conjunction with the Brazilian Federal 
Police, DEA Brazil and AmEmbassy Brasilia's Narcotics Affairs 
Section (NAS) work together to dismantle large-scale international 
drug trafficking organizations (DTO), particularly those with ties 
to the United States (US).  To better achieve this objective, DEA 
Brazil and NAS are constantly searching for new ways to increase 
productivity and strengthen relationships with the Federal Police 
(DPF).  Our principal means of exerting leverage on the GOB are 
through:  1) the provision of NAS funding, i.e., training courses, 
conferences, and necessary equipment, and 2) facilitate the exchange 
of intelligence and case information between DEA Brazil and the DPF. 
 End Summary. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  As Brazil is a transshipment country in which drug 
trafficking organizations maintain key command and control center, 
it is key that we maintain the excellent relationship between NAS 
and DEA here.  During the past several years, some Colombian 
traffickers have been moving their bases of operations from Colombia 
to Brazil as they (erroneously) see Brazil as a country where they 
will not be as easily targeted, arrested, prosecuted and/or 
extradited.  The most prominent example of this is the international 
operation "Twin Oceans," a joint DEA-Brazilian Federal Police 
investigation which on May 16, 2006 culminated in the arrest of 
Colombian national Pablo Joaquin Rayo Montano in Sao Paulo and ten 
other members of his organization in Brazil.  (See reftel.)  In that 
operation, the DPF's NAS-supported Sensitive Intelligence Unit (SIU) 
monitored 25 lines, intercepted over 125,000 phone calls, and was 
key to the success of the bust. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  In addition, DPF intelligence indicates that Colombian 
drug trafficking organizations have made inroads into Brazil with 
respect to the transshipment of heroin to the U.S. and other world 
markets.  DEA Brazil has noticed a dramatic increase in the number 
of heroin seizures in the past six months that have either been 
seized in Brazil destined for the United States or that have been 
seized in the United States but originated from Brazil. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) INL/NAS involvement is also key to post's efforts in the 
porous Tri-border area.  NAS funding helps DEA Brazil to further 
enhance its capabilities there and continue to fight the war on 
terrorism.  Indeed, the lack of manpower and funding are the most 
important issues facing the joint DEA/NAS SIU in Brazil.  Without 
additional agents and funding, in the future post will not be able 
to replicate the past successes of this program.

Joint DEA/NAS Activities 
------------------------ 
 
¶6. (SBU)  Below are examples of ongoing joint activities. 
 
--  Border Control.  The GOB's flagship anti-drug effort is 
Operation COBRA (Colombia-Brazil), aimed at reinforcing the 
country's northern borders with Colombia via riverine patrols. 
Similar efforts are underway to reinforce the Peru, Venezuela, 
Bolivia, Guyana and Suriname borders.  NAS funding pays for items 
such as night vision equipment, small riverine boats and port 
control training, while DEA provides Operation COBRA with 
intelligence and information support.   In addition, NAS has funded 
the TDY to Brazil of four Bolivian SIU officers who are assisting in 
SIU investigations targeting Spanish speakers.  It is anticipated 
that four more Bolivians will be assigned to work at the 
Bolivia-Brazil border this calendar year. 
 
--  SIU and Intel Collection.  The SIU, jointly funded by NAS and 
DEA, conducts wiretap investigations which generate thousands of 
call detail records.  These records are sent to DEA Brazil for 
analysis where they are imported into a database that can be 
accessed by numerous U.S. law enforcement and Intelligence Community 
agencies.  The NAS- funded SIU wiretap room in Sao Paulo has been so 
successful that DEA Panama is planning to use it as a model for its 
SIU.  In addition, DEA Brazil and NAS are in the process of 
 
BRASILIA 00001337  002 OF 002 
 
 
convincing the DPF of the importance of signing onto multinational 
information sharing centers such as the Special Operations Division 
(SOD) and the El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC). 
 
--  Airport Interdiction.  The DEA Sao Paulo Office has a strong 
interdiction program at the Sao Paulo International Airport. 
Currently, DEA is working to establish an airport interdiction 
program at the Rio de Janeiro International airport and in the 
future it would like to expand this effort to airports in Northern 
Brazil.  DEA Brazil sent two DPF agents from Sao Paulo and two DPF 
Agents from Rio de Janeiro to attend Sky Narc training in Reno, 
Nevada.  DEA Brazil is also attempting to set up airport training 
for the DPF agents at airports located within the Tri-border area. 
DEA is working with NAS to fund this project. 
 
--  Analysis of Cocaine Samples.  DEA Brazil has established a 
domestic monitoring program in cooperation with the DPF.  The 
program models the domestic monitoring program in the United States, 
where samples of cocaine seizures are sent to the Special Testing 
and Research Laboratory for signature analysis.  The analysis of the 
cocaine samples determines purity levels, identifies the source 
country from where the drugs originated, and differentiates between 
source country HCl processing. From a strategic intelligence 
perspective, this will provide invaluable intelligence on the 
cocaine threat not only within Brazil but also South America.  NAS 
has provided the funding to send Brazilian chemists to Washington to 
attend Forensic Chemical training sponsored by DEA and it is 
anticipated that two additional chemists will travel to Washington 
in September to attend cocaine signature training.
