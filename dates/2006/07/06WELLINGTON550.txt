Begin Text: 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade presents its compliments 
to the Embassy of the United States of America and has the honour to 
refer to the Multilateral Agreement on the Liberalization of 
International Air Transportation ("the Agreement") done at 
Washington on 1 May 2001 and to which the United States of America 
is a State Party, and to the Protocol to the Multilateral Agreement 
on the Liberalization of International Air Transportation ("the 
Protocol") done at Washington on 1 May 2001. 
 
New Zealand, in its capacity as depositary, advised on 27 March 2006 
that an Instrument of Accession to the Agreement and to the Protocol 
had been received from the Government of the Cook Islands.  Pursuant 
to Article 20.5 of the Agreement, and Article 4.4 of the Protocol, 
any State Party who did not wish the Agreement or the Protocol to 
apply between that State Party and the Cook Islands must have 
notified the depositary accordingly, in writing, within ninety 
days. 
 
As no State Party to the Agreement notified the depositary of such 
non-application, the Agreement shall enter into force between all 
States Parties to the Agreement and the Cook Islands on 23 July 
2006, as the thirtieth (30th) day after the expiration of the ninety 
day period referred to above. 
 
As no State Party to the Protocol notified the depositary of such 
non-application, the Protocol shall also enter into force between 
all States Parties to the Protocol and the Cook Islands on 23 July 
¶2006. 
 
The current status list for the Convention is attached for the 
United States of America's reference. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade takes this opportunity to 
renew to the Embassy of the United States of America the assurances 
of its highest consideration.
