for Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1.  (C) New Zealand supports immediate negotiations on a 
fissile material cut-off treaty (FMCT) and could accept the 
US-proposed mandate as the basis for talks, according to 
Caroline McDonald, Director of the Disarmament Division at 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT).  McDonald 
told Pol-Econ Couns that GNZ believes we'd convince other CD 
partners to engage in talks if 1) we engage with other 
Conference on Disarmament (CD) partners on substantive 
discussions (as opposed to negotiations) on the other three 
core CD areas, and 2) if we reject an explicit Western Group 
endorsement of the US mandate in favor of informal, 
cross-regional outreach.  McDonald stressed that NZ strongly 
agrees with our objectives and differs only on tactics.  PE 
Couns reminded McDonald that the U.S. supports all CD 
objectives but regard the potential for terrorist and rogue 
states to acquire nuclear weapons as the most urgent threat 
to world security. 
 
¶2.  (C) The following is a GNZ non-paper drafted by NZ's 
Geneva mission that summarizes  GNZ's position.  McDonald 
also shared notes from the recent presentation by NZ's Geneva 
rep, Don MacKay, at the UNIDIR seminar, in which he made 
clear that GNZ favors the destruction of all fissile 
materials, not just a moratorium on production. 
 
¶3.  (C) Begin non-paper text: 
 
New Zealand Non-Paper on FMCT 
 
-- New Zealand strongly supports the immediate commencement 
of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty (FMCT). 
 
-- New Zealand could accept the US-proposed mandate as the 
basis for the commencement of those negotiations.  During 
negotiations, New Zealand would expect to address all issues 
relevant to a FMCT, including scope and verification. 
 
-- New Zealand does not believe that explicit joint Western 
Group endorsement of the US mandate at this stage would be 
helpful in achieving the commencement of negotiations in the 
Conference on Disarmament (CD). 
 
-- A strong Western Group push in support of the US mandate 
within the CD's current fragile negotiating environment could 
be interpreted as an isolationist (FMCT-only) approach and 
could further entrench regional group blockages in moving 
towards the adoption of a programme of work; a prerequisite 
for the commencement of negotiations. 
 
-- We note that a large number of Western Group members share 
this concern, and are similarly opposed to group endorsement 
of the US mandate at this stage. 
 
-- We see the best way to proceed as to work on a 
cross-regional outreach in informal bilateral and small group 
settings in order to get buy-in from all regional groups.  It 
is clear that a solution to the CD's deadlock will require a 
mechanism that allows all four of the CD's core issues to be 
dealt with in a manner appropriate to each subject. 
 
-- We sense that there is scope for a successful resolution 
of the programme of work stand-off in a formula which would 
comprise negotiations on a FMCT whilst continuing focused 
discussions on PAROS, nuclear disarmament, and negative 
security assurances. 
 
-- We share the US assessment that there is increased 
flexibility and momentum amongst the CD's membership.  We 
need to think laterally about how best to turn that 
flexibility onto concrete progress.  As agreement which meets 
our objectives on FMCT negotiations whilst allowing other 
countries to buy in to the process by encompassing other core 
issues within a discussion framework would preserve the 
national security concerns of all States and has the best 
potential to enable the CD to recommence substantive work. 
 
End text of non-paper. 
 
¶4.  (C) Comment: GNZ's long-standing belief that we and other 
nuclear states should commit now to destroy our nuclear 
weapons is well known and has created some friction with us 
in the NPT.  But we regard GNZ's offer of support for the 
FMCT and the non-paper as a genuine attempt to be 
 
constructive, not a back-door means to get us talking on the 
elimination of our nuclear stockpile and related materials. 
End Comment.
