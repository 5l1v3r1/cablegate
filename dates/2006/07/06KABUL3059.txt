Poloff delivered reftel talking points and press statement 
July 8 to MFA U.S. Desk Officer Mirwais Samadi and North-East 
Asia Desk Officer Wali Mohamad Azizi.  Azizi said the MFA 
received a similar demarche from the Japanese Embassy.  He 
said Afghanistan supported the U.S. and Japanese positions 
opposing North Korea's missile tests and nuclear program. 
Samadi added that Afghanistan's policy is to push for a 
nuclear free region, particularly South Asia, but including 
Asia as a whole.
