We welcome the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism 
signed by the Presidents of the United States and the Russian 
Federation and announced on July 15, 2006. 
 
The dimensions of terrorist acts in recent years have shown 
the use of updated technology by terrorists and have brought 
nuclear terrorism to the forefront among threats to 
international peace and security. 
 
Believing that the fight against terrorism can only be 
efficiently carried out within the context of international 
cooperation, Turkey has supported and contributed to all 
initiatives implemented in the international arena for this 
aim, starting with the efforts of the United Nations. 
 
Turkey welcomed the UN Security Council Resolution 1540 
(2004) aimed at preventing of the use of weapons of mass 
destruction by terrorists and has started implementing it. 
Turkey has signed the UN Convention on Nuclear Terrorism, 
which was opened to signature last year. 
 
Turkey supports the U.S.-Russian joint initiative aimed at 
preventing the use of nuclear weapons by terrorists as an 
important additional stage in the fight against the nuclear 
dimension of terrorism. 
 
Responding o the invitation, Turkey will also participate in 
the first meeting to be organized by the U.S. and Russia on 
this issue.
