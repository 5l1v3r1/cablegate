SUBJECT: MPN WARNS OF CEDULA IRREGULARITIES 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul Trivelli for reasons 1.4 (b and d) 
 
¶1. (C) Summary: Movimiento por Nicaragua (MpN) leaders warned 
poloffs on July 14 that Nicaragua's Supreme Electoral Council 
(CSE) is failing to issue national/voter ID cards (cedulas) 
in a fair and efficient manner.  A recent MpN study of 
eligible voters in secondary schools revealed that only 18 
percent of students aged 16 to 18 currently possess their 
cedula.  They also reported irregularities with cedula 
issuances and presented copies of cedula application forms 
with no names filled in that were nevertheless approved for 
processing.  MpN will present this evidence to the OAS and 
other members of the international community as well as the 
Nicaraguan media.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (C) On July 14, poloffs met with MpN Executive Director 
Pilar Martinez and Board Members Klaus Stadthagen and Aurora 
Gurdian to discuss MpN's recent study of the cedulation 
process.  MpN interviewed 13,381 secondary school students at 
134 schools throughout Nicaragua to inquire about their 
cedula status.  Of the total, 6,009 (45%) do not possess a 
cedula, 4,160 (31%) have applied for a cedula, and only 2,204 
(18%) actually have a cedula.  The study also inquired 
whether the students had birth certificates (a requirement to 
apply for a cedula), but most were uncertain. 
 
¶3. (C) During the study, MpN witnessed or heard about several 
irregularities regarding cedula issuances.  In the rural 
municipality of Rio Blanco, department of Matagalpa, MpN 
discovered several cedula applications approved by the local 
Departmental Electoral Council (CED) that had photos, but no 
names.  Martinez noted that these cedulas could potentially 
be used by unqualified impostors.  In addition, MpN officials 
heard rumors of "cedula houses" where FSLN and PLC activists 
can apply for and receive expedited cedulas, although they 
have not yet been able to verify the validity of these claims. 
 
¶4. (C) MpN will submit the study results and reports of 
irregularities to the OAS, Carter Center, IFES, European 
Union and Elections Donor Group, hoping that the 
international community will pressure the CSE to issue 
cedulas to young adults in a more pro-active and nonpartisan 
manner.  Polcouns urged the group to also bring public 
pressure to bear on the CSE by using the media and organizing 
protests if necessary. 
 
¶5. (C) Comment: The August 6 deadline is part of Nicaragua's 
Citizen Identification Law (all cedulas must be applied for 
90 days before the registration).  Nevertheless, MpN will 
pressure the CSE to move the date or provide for some kind of 
alternative documentation if the percentage of eligible youth 
voters without cedulas remains high.  Liberal Constitutional 
Party (PLC) and Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance (ALN) lawmakers 
recently amended the Citizen Identification Law and could do 
so again.  Ambassador will meet with OAS electoral 
observation mission chiefs on July 18 to discuss the MpN 
study and other elections issues.  For the November 5 
elections to be considered truly democratic, they must be 
inclusive, which will not occur if large segments of the 
population remain disenfranchised.
