SUMMARY 
------- 
¶1.  (SBU) The Mouride Khalif has banned campaigning in his 
brotherhood's capital.  As Senegal's fastest growing city, 
with at least half 800,000 souls, Touba looked to become a 
political battleground for 2007 elections.  The holy city 
by tradition has no polling station, and was considered 
politically off-limits until Mouride Abdoulaye Wade 
campaigned there in 2000.  While Mourides are by no means 
a monolithic bloc, Wade presumably retains sympathy there, 
so the ban on campaigning will not help him.  END SUMMARY. 
 
VOTE WITH YOUR FEET 
------------------- 
¶2.  (SBU) Mouride religious leaders allow GOS services and 
civil servants to operate in Touba, but the city remains 
in many ways independent of central government and the 
state recognizes the Khalif's powers and prerogatives (Ref 
C).  The ban on campaigning followed a recent incident in 
which dissidents in Wade's ruling Senegalese Democratic 
Party (PDS), threw stones at national party leaders.  The 
Khalif will allow voter registration, but, as in the past, 
he will probably exclude polling booths and Toubiens will 
need to go to neighboring MBacke to vote. 
 
DANCE THE NIGHT AWAY 
-------------------- 
¶3.  (SBU) While there are partisan divisions in Touba, the 
ban on campaigning will probably hurt Wade more than 
anyone else, since he is the only serious Mouride 
presidential candidate.  The Khalif and his advisers, 
though, are not casting the ban primarily as a show of 
political neutrality.  Rather, they describe it as a way 
of renewing the city's spiritual anchoring in Islam and as 
a rejection of the permissive society they see infecting 
the holy city.  Traditionalists around the aging Khalif 
particularly deplore the "cultural animation" -- music and 
dancing -- that accompany political rallies. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
¶4.  (SBU) The Khalif is pushing 90 and only dimly aware of 
what is going on in the city, so the campaign ban comes 
from his entourage.  For them, banning open political 
competition, and doing so by emphasizing the dictates of 
spiritual purity, is a way to restrain the secularization 
of power and defend their prerogatives.  Still, the fact 
that the ban is widely seen as the Khalif's reaction to an 
incident of political violence does serve as a positive 
reminder to the country's leaders that the brotherhoods 
stand for peace and the democratic consensus.  END 
COMMENT.
