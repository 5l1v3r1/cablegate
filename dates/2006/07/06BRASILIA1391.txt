Â¶1. Poloff delivered reftel's talking points and the President's 
message to Gustavo Bezerra in the MFA's Division for Asia and 
Oceania.  In the course of the conversation, Bezerra reported that 
Brazil had released a statement on July 6 expressing worry over the 
situation, lamenting the launch and issuing a call for all parties 
to return to the negotiating table.  He also noted that the MFA's 
North Korean interlocutors had stated that they would not return to 
talks because the U.S. had insulted the DPRK with unsubstantiated 
accusations of money laundering.  These contacts also told the MFA 
that the United States, during previous six-party talks, had 
promised the DPRK two light-water reactors which it had never 
provided.
