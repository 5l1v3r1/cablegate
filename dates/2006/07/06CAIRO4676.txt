Summary 
------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Cairo-based Regional Refugee Coordinator Cheyne met 
separately with WFP representative Marius de Gaay Fortman, and UNHCR 
Representative Peter van der Vaart, in Algiers July 27. WFP is 
concerned that a break in the Tindouf food pipeline is imminent with 
significant shortfalls expected for the balance of CY2006.  With 
little support from UNHCR, WFP is on a collision course with the 
Government of Algeria over the question of camp numbers as it 
attempts to negotiate a WFP/UNHCR/Red Crescent tripartite agreement 
for ongoing food aid deliveries when the current Protracted Refugee 
and Recovery Operation (PRRO) expires at the end of this month 
(August).  WFP has proposed to the GOA that the current arrangement 
(with WFP supplying sufficient food for 125,000) will continue to 
the end of CY2006 but unless agreement is reached on numbers WFP 
will revert to 90,000 as the base figure and cut supplies 
accordingly.  It is unlikely the GOA and the Sahrawis will agree to 
this figure.  UNHCR seems to have little stomach for confronting the 
problems that beset the food aid program and may find some of its 
programs supplanted by UNICEF activities in future. 
 
---------- 
Background 
---------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Cairo-based Regional Refugee Coordinator Cheyne met 
separately with WFP representative Marius de Gaay Fortman, and UNHCR 
Representative Peter van der Vaart, in Algiers July 27, for an 
update on food supplies for the Sahrawi refugees in the Tindouf 
camps. The Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM) is 
currently considering food aid funding for the Western Saharan 
refugees. 
 
¶4. (SBU) A major concern in the past has been the lack of control 
over food aid distribution from the Rabouni warehouse area in 
Tindouf to the four camps in the surrounding desert. Although UNHCR 
is nominally responsible for food distribution from Rabouni, it was 
apparent when RefCoord visited Tindouf last September that UNHCR has 
surrendered control to the Sahrawi government-in-exile through the 
Sahrawi Red Crescent (CRS).  Under this arrangement there is no 
tracking of food after CRS takes the food from Rabouni. The problem 
has been further compounded by huge discrepancies in the various 
estimates of the camp populations, and the refusal by the Sahrawis 
and the GOA to permit a census or registration of camp inhabitants. 
This has led to allegations of food diversion (possibly to support 
Polisario forces). WFP food has appeared in the markets of Tindouf, 
Mauritania and Mali, supporting these allegations.  Uncertainty 
about the numbers has also provoked persistent allegations of 
"double funding" by the Algerian Red Crescent (CRA), a major conduit 
for aid to the Sahrawi (CRA receives funding from over 30 different 
donors). 
 
----------------- 
Uncertain Numbers 
----------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) The Sahrawis and the GOA have for years maintained there 
are 158,000 people in the camps and this figure has been the 
yardstick for food and other aid requirements.  But satellite 
imagery obtained by the Europeans in 2005 suggested there were 
around 90,000 camp inhabitants and UNHCR and WFP cut back food 
supplies accordingly.  The issue is still unresolved.  After severe 
flooding in the area earlier this year UNHCR/WFP established a 
compromise formula whereby they would continue to supply sufficient 
food for 90,000 of the most vulnerable camp inhabitants plus 
additional food to assist an estimated 35,000 flood victims.  The 
Sahrawi and the GOA have not accepted that the new aggregate figure 
of 125,000 reflects actual camp numbers, insisting instead that the 
population remains at 158,000.  The Sahrawis say they are managing 
the supposed shortfall by reducing per capita allocations (e.g., 
they say refugees are getting 10.7 kg of wheat flour instead of the 
WFP allocation of 13.5kg). 
 
-------------- 
Pipeline Break 
-------------- 
¶6. (SBU) With no resolution of these issues in sight, WFP's Fortman 
painted a dismal picture of a fragile hand-to-mouth food pipeline as 
reduced contributions by regular donors Spain, Canada, France and 
the U.S., have this year failed to match program needs.  Although EC 
support has remained steadfast, and Sweden, Switzerland, the 
Netherlands and Ireland have provided additional donations, the 
pipeline currently shows a shortfall to the end of the CY2006 of 
7,836MT of wheat flour, 1,242MT of pulses, 602MTMT of vegetable oil, 
648MT of sugar and 116MT of high energy biscuits. Malnutrition 
levels remain high with continuing deficiencies of micronutrients, 
animal protein, (meat, milk) and fresh fruit (although ECHO has just 
donated Euros 2m for fresh fruit for the remainder of the CY). 
 
----------------- 
Crunch Time Ahead 
----------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) WFP intends to extend the current Protracted Refugee and 
Recovery Operation (PRRO), due to expire on August 31, to the end of 
CY2006.  A Joint Assessment Mission (JAM) is tentatively planned for 
September but may be postponed until late October/November (i.e., 
until after Ramadan). The findings of the JAM will be used as the 
basis for a new 2007-2008 PRRO, where the major issue will once 
again be the numbers.  Neither Fortman nor Van der Vaart expects the 
numbers issue to be resolved for the new PRRO.  They point out that 
support for registration/census among donors is uneven and UNHCR 
itself has little motivation to support pressure for an agreement on 
numbers since its aid programs are focused largely on infrastructure 
and targeted camp populations and are not determined by aggregate 
numbers.  Negotiations for a tripartite agreement for aid 
distribution between UNHCR, WFP and the CRA have been stalled 
because the draft agreement uses 90,000 as the base figure for needs 
assessment. 
 
¶8. (SBU) In the absence of any clear consensus on numbers, WFP is 
facing a crunch in its efforts to establish a new project document 
with the GOA to take it beyond August 31.  Fortman says WFP has 
little support from the UN in forcing the issue and faces opposition 
from the GOA - which also happens to be a major donor (about Euros 
15m a year).  Through its regional office in Cairo, WFP has advised 
the GOA that it will extend the current program of supplying food 
for 125,000 until the end of the CY, but that it would prefer to 
base future food aid on agreed figures.  If agreed numbers are not 
forthcoming by January WFP will revert to 90,000 as the basis for 
food distribution. 
 
-------------------- 
UNHCR's  Performance 
-------------------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) Following our visit to Tindouf last September we reported 
that UNHCR's Algeria mission seemed to be in disarray.  It had poor 
relations with WFP, the two senior officers in Algiers and the 
nutritionist in Tindouf had left the country, the Head of the 
Tindouf sub-office seemed disengaged and its supplementary feeding 
programs appeared to be ineffectual.  There have been some 
improvements.  There is a new representative (Peter Van der Vaart). 
The Head of the Tindouf sub-office has been moved to Geneva and a 
replacement has been named (Alessandra Morel) although she has yet 
to take up the position.  A new Junior Protection Officer (JPO) 
position in Tindouf has just been filled and there are hopes that 
the Tindouf office will now take a more active role in monitoring 
the activities of the CRS and CRA in the field.  There is a new 
sense of amity between WFP and UNHCR although WFP's Fortman is 
openly critical of UNHCR's apparent lack of interest in engaging the 
GOA over the need to settle the numbers issue and to establish a 
sound foundation for subsequent food aid programs.  Fortman also 
commented that UNICEF was aggressively trying to carve out a role in 
Tindouf and might take over from UNHCR some responsibility for 
supplementary feeding programs in future.
