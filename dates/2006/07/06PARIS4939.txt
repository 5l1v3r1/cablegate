SUBJECT: TFLE01 CHIRAC ANNOUNCES EMERGENCY AID TO LEBANON; 
CALLS FOR "HUMANITARIAN CORRIDOR" 
 
¶1. SUMMARY: After meeting with the Cabinet on July 19, 
President Chirac announced France would be sending emergency 
aid to Lebanon and calls for "humanitarian corridors" to be 
opened.  Chirac said that the GoF was cooperating closely 
with Lebanese officials on their needs. He also took the 
opportunity to stress the GoF's plea for a "humanitarian 
truce" and the conditions necessary to move beyond the 
current situation.  France, he said, would continue to work 
with the international community towards a cessation of 
violence.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2. President Chirac met with his key cabinet members on July 
19, before making a presidential statement on the situation 
in Lebanon.  In his declaration he reiterated the G8 text, 
called for the liberation of Israeli soldiers, an end to 
rocket attacks into Israel, and an end to all targeting of 
civilian infrastructure in Lebanon.  Regarding Palestine, he 
insisted that dialogue with PA President Abbas, needed to be 
restarted.  Chirac reiterated the need to implement UNSCR 
1559, and for the Lebanese government to take control over 
its entire territory.  Re-establishment of authority, 
stability and the sovereignty of Lebanon was the only way to 
assure peaceful, democratic governance. 
 
¶3.  The President called particular attention to the 
humanitarian situation in Lebanon, citing destruction of 
civilian infrastructure, including places of food production 
and milk for children.  Chirac announced that France, working 
with Lebanese authorities, would be sending emergency aid via 
aircraft today, July 19.  The GoF would also be keeping large 
ships in the area, now being used for evacuations, as a 
possible means for the transport of humanitarian supplies. 
 
¶4. "Humanitarian corridors," Chirac said, needed to be opened 
immediately.  The safe movement of displaced persons and 
emergency supplies inside the country was vital.  In 
addition, a corridor from Cyprus to Lebanon for humanitarian 
purposes needed to be put in place.  These safe passages were 
essential to the well being of the Lebanese people. 
 
¶5.  Chirac closed by offering the Lebanese people France's 
moral support, but also all means possible for humanitarian 
relief.
