SUBJECT:  Fight Continues Over Eviction of Islamic 
University in Juba 
 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY:  The dispute over the eviction of the branch 
of the Koran Al Karim Islamic University from the 
premises of former Juba Girl's Senior Secondary School in 
Juba continues as both the government of Central 
Equatorial State (CES) and the administration of the 
Koran Al Karim Islamic University adamantly claim 
ownership of the institution.  The Government of Southern 
Sudan (GOSS), Government of National Unity (GNU), and the 
GoSS Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research 
are mediating to resolve the dispute.  In the meantime, 
GoSS President Kiir has suspended the CES-ordered 
eviction of the Islamic University.  End Summary.

¶2.  The Islamic government of President Gen. Ibrahim 
Abboud established the Islamic Institute in Juba, and 
several others throughout Southern Sudan, in the 1950s. 
After the revolt of Torit in August 1955, the institute 
began to decline and was closed in 1964.  After the Addis 
Ababa Agreement of 1972, the Regional High Executive 
Council of Southern Sudan created the Juba Girls Senior 
Secondary School on the grounds of the Islamic Institute. 
In 2002, the Government of Sudan reclaimed the campus and 
established a branch of Koran Al Karim Islamic 
University.  Students of Juba Girls' School were 
transferred to the Abu Diya Girls' School. 
 
¶3.  On April 19, 2006 the CES attorney general ordered 
the eviction of Koran Al Karim Islamic University from 
the former Juba Girl's Senior Secondary School.  The 
police initially delayed the execution of the order 
because the students were taking their examinations, but 
after examinations were completed on May 30, the police 
took control of the administration buildings and the 
lecture halls.  The university and its students were 
allowed to keep the dormitories until final arrangements 
could be made.  Later that day, GoSS President Kiir 
issued a decreed from Khartoum suspending the eviction 
order until his return to Juba. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶4.  The Government of Southern Sudan (GOSS), Government 
of National Unity (GNU), and the GoSS Ministry of Higher 
Education and Scientific Research are currently all 
working to resolve this dispute and the eviction order 
remains suspended.  The legal issues in this case are 
clouded by some strong emotions, as most southerners are 
suspicious of Islam, and do not want to see the 
continuation of institutions established by their 
northern oppressors.
