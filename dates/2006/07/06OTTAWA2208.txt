SUBJECT: CANADIAN RESPONSE -- APPEAL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS FOR 
HAITI INTERIM COOPERATION FRAMEWORK EXTENSION 
 
REF: STATE 116137 
 
¶1.  Ginette Martin, Director of the Department of Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT)'s Haiti Division, 
informed Embassy Ottawa on July 21 that the Government of 
Canada will pledge C$520 million (roughly US$460 million at 
today's exchange rate) over five years for development 
assistance in Canada.  The Canadian delegation to the July 25 
donor's conference will be led by Canadian International 
Development Agency (CIDA) President Robert Greenhill; 
Minister of International Cooperation Josee Verner will not 
be able to attend.  The delegation will include officials 
from CIDA, DFAIT, and Canada's Embassy in Haiti. 
 
¶2.  Ms. Martin said that the GOC shares the USG's concerns 
and agrees that now is an important window of opportunity for 
Haiti.  The five year total pledge of C$520 million 
represents a significant increase over Canada's past 
donations of roughly C$20 million per year and is also an 
increase over the GOC's July 2004 pledge of C$180 million 
over two years (made at the Washington donors conference). 
 
¶3.  The C$520 million pledge over five years will be 
concentrated in the four priority areas under the Interim 
Cooperation Framework (ICF), but will not be strictly tied to 
the ICF, in light of its future winding down.  Ms. Martin 
described the GOC's specific focus for this pledge as 
including economic governance, security and justice, local 
development, electricity generation and basic services.  The 
C$520 million sum includes CIDA funding as well as C$15 
million from DFAIT's Global Peace and Security Fund and C$15 
million from the RCMP's International Police fund (note:  The 
C$15 million from the RCMP will include funding to support 
100 Canadian police officers in Haiti.)
