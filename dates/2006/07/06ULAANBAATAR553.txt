¶1.  (U) Reftel reported GOM's decision to send a 
seventh rotation of soldiers to Iraq, consisting of a 
"small number of command staff officers."  The sixth 
rotation, whose tour is up in September, consists of 
100 soldiers, serving under Polish command in Camp 
Echo, performing force protection duties. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On July 20, DCM and E/P Chief met with PM's 
Foreign Policy Advisor Davaasuren and with MFA Director 
General for Americas, Middle East and Africa 
Jambaldorj.  DCM welcomed the Mongolian decision to 
continue to participate in the military coalition in 
Iraq, but noted that the process for conveying this 
decision to us could have been better; we had only 
received the MFA note late yesterday after an erroneous 
newspaper report in the morning indicating that the 
National Security Council (NSC) had decided before the 
July 11-14 Naadam holiday to completely withdraw from 
Iraq. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Jambaldorj agreed that the process could have 
been better, and explained that the cabinet, and not 
the NSC as the press had reported, had made the 
decision on July 7.  Because of the press of foreign 
delegations arriving for Mongolia's 800th anniversary 
celebration during Naadam, paper flow had been stopped 
within the government.  Commenting that Mongolian 
newspapers are prone to carrying inaccurate reports, 
Jambaldorj said that the newspaper's information was 
erroneous: there had been no discussion at the NSC 
meeting or in Cabinet of totally withdrawing from Iraq, 
only of deploying a group of officers.  He stressed 
that the only factor going into the government's 
decision was a shortage of peacekeeping soldiers, which 
had been particularly affected by the deployment of the 
250 soldiers in the second rotation to the UN war 
crimes tribunal in Sierra Leone.  He added that 
Mongolia continues to talk to Turkey about a deployment 
of soldiers to Afghanistan under Turkish command at 
some point in the future, but said that no government 
decision has been made yet.  Davaasuren added that, 
whenever the subject had come up, Prime Minister 
Enkhbold had always been a strong supporter of 
continuing Mongolia's military commitment in Iraq. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Note:  We intend to work with MFA and the 
Ministry of Defense to correct any misimpressions about 
the GOM decision, and to publicly welcome the 
commitment to remaining a part of the military 
coalition in Iraq.
