REF: STATE 153063 
 
1.(U) We delivered draft SOFA template contained in reftel to 
North America Desk Director Harry Purwanto at the Department 
of Foreign Affairs.  Purwanto said he would circulate it to 
relevant agencies and offices ahead of a September 20 
interagency meeting in preparation for the October 5 
bilateral discussions. 
 
Â¶2. (U) Pursuant to reftel instructions, we urged that as many 
relevant agencies as possible be represented at the October 5 
talks.  Purwanto said he hoped to know more clearly after the 
interagency meeting which agencies would be represented. 
Purwanto said he would raise at that time any additional 
questions GOI might have.  He stated that Director General 
for American and European Affairs Eddy Suryanto Dwihardono 
had blocked out two and a half, possibly three hours for 
talks that day.
