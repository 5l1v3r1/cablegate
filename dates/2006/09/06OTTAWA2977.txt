¶1. (U) On September 29, Economic Minister-Counselor discussed 
ref A demarche with Sarah Taylor, Director, Development 
Policy and Institutions Division, Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade Canada (DFAIT) and with Glynnis French, 
Deputy Director, Strategies and Partnerships Sector, 
Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada 
(FINTRAC).  The political section also shared the demarche 
with Jennifer Irish, Deputy Director, International Crime and 
Terrorism Division, DFAIT.  FINTRAC is the Canadian 
Government agency which receives, analyzes, assesses and 
discloses financial intelligence on suspected money 
laundering, terrorist financing, and threats to Canada's 
security.  It is an integral part of Canada's commitment to 
fight money laundering and terrorist activity financing. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Our interlocutors appreciated receiving reftel's 
information on how the U.S. is carrying out the work of the 
St. Petersburg Summit, including the President's National 
Strategy.   They said that Canada fully supports U.S. and 
international efforts against corruption because it diverts 
money from helping local populations, fosters crime, 
diminishes the effectiveness of aid, and corrodes governance. 
 The FINTRAC official told us that the Harper government will 
introduce legislation in Parliament within the next few weeks 
to expand the agency's responsibilities and resources to 
combat money laundering and terrorist financing.  The Embassy 
will report this in more detail once information becomes 
available.
