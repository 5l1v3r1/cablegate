     ¶C. SECSTATE 140757 
 
¶1.  (U)  This is an action request -- see paragraph 4 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Ref B reported that Spain, in response to Ref C 
request, would likely agree to support the candidacy of 
Steven Lett to head the IMSO in the event that the Spanish 
candidate for the same position was eliminated prior to Lett. 
 Ref B predicted that Spain would ask for reciprocity (i.e., 
U.S. support for the Spanish candidate in the event that Lett 
was eliminated prior to the Spaniard) and requested guidance 
on how to respond.  Such guidance was never received. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  On September 13, MFA forwarded to the Embassy a 
Note Verbale requesting such reciprocity.  What follows is an 
informal Embassy translation of the operative part of this 
GOS Note Verbale: 
 
"has the honor to request that the U.S. Government support 
the candidacy of Mr. Esteban Pacha for the position of 
Director of the International Mobile Satellite Organization 
(IMSO) in the event that the U.S. candidate for the 
aforementioned position, Mr. Steven Lett, were eliminated 
prior to Mr. Pacha.  In reciprocity, Spain would promise to 
support the candidacy of Mr. Lett if during election process, 
the Spanish candidate were eliminated first." 
 
¶4.  (U)  Action Request:  Embassy requests guidance on how to 
respond to the Spanish offer.  If the U.S. accepts the 
Spanish offer, Embassy requests text to be used in the 
diplomatic note that would seal the deal.
