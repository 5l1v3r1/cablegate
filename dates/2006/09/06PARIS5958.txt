REF: A. PARIS 5674 
     ¶B. STATE 125421 
 
 ¶1. (SBU)   SUMMARY.  Air France is confident that it will be 
able to transmit PNR data to the USG on October 1 with or 
without a new US-EU PNR agreement.  The airline at present 
has no plans to file with the France Data Privacy Commission 
(CNIL) for approval of its current No Fly procedures, 
contrary to what we have heard from the GOF (ref A).  Air 
France has also confirmed that the GOF has signaled 
informally that it no longer needs to notify the French 
border police (PAF) of suspected No Fly &hits8 before 
notifying the USG.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)   PNR.  Guy Tardieu (protect throughout), chief of 
staff to Air France-KLM Chairman and CEO Jean-Cyril Spinetta, 
told Economic Minister-Counselor August 31  that Air France 
is confident that the airline will be able to continue 
transmission of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data to the USG 
on October 1, whether or not a new U.S.-EU PNR agreement is 
in place by September 30.  Tardieu admitted that the carrier 
would do so in a legal limbo, but expected no immediate 
problem with the continuation of current procedures.  He 
cautioned, however, that the longer PNR transmission proceeds 
without such an agreement, the greater the chance that 
pressure will grow for action by national data privacy 
authorities. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)   NO FLY / CNIL.  Contrary to what Embassy 
officials heard from the GOF last week (ref A), Air France 
currently has no plans to file formally with the French Data 
Privacy Commission (CNIL) for approval of its No Fly 
procedures.  Tardieu said that he has had informal 
discussions with the CNIL, and believes that the CNIL is 
prepared to let the status quo reign until DHS introduces its 
APIS Quick Query (AQQ) name check system.  Air France hopes - 
optimistically in our view - that AQQ may obviate the need 
for CNIL oversight/approval of passenger data transmission. 
(Comment.  This is not the first time we have received 
different renditions of the state-of-play on CNIL issues from 
the GOF and Air France.  End Comment.) 
 
¶4.  (SBU)   NO FLY / PAF.  Air France confirmed that the GOF 
has told the airline informally that it need no longer notify 
the French Border Police (PAF) of suspected No Fly &hits8 
before notifying the USG.  (See ref A for initial report.) 
Tardieu said that he does not expect to receive this 
instruction in writing from the GOF, citing &sovereignty8 
sensitivities.
