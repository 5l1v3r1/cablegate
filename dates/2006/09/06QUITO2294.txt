REF: STATE 151212 
 
Â¶1.  (SBU) The DCM delivered RefTel points on September 13 to 
Acting Foreign Minister Diego Ribadeneira, conveying USG 
concern that Sudan might use the Non-Aligned Movement Summit 
in Havana to undermine international efforts to deploy a UN 
peacekeeping mission to Darfur.  The DCM stressed the urgency 
and importance of sending a peacekeeping force and requested 
GOE support.  Ribadeneira said that he was unaware of the 
issue, but promised to immediately share our concerns with 
Ecuador's delegation in Havana.  (Comment:  The GOE has 
historically been very supportive of UN peacekeeping 
missions, a policy that was recently reaffirmed in the 
Defense Ministry's "white paper." End Comment.)
