SUBJECT: CRIMEAN-CONGO FEVER IN TURKEY 
 
¶1.  Summary: Cases of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever in Turkey have 
increased over prior years to 279, which resulted in 20 deaths over 
the past summer, causing public concern.  Because transmission to 
humans is mainly via ticks from domesticated animals, the Ministry 
of Health is coordinating closely with the Ministry of Agriculture, 
building on cooperation mechanisms established in combating avian 
influenza.  Although the number of human deaths is larger than those 
for avian influenza, the economic effect has been much smaller, the 
impact is limited to six provinces east of Ankara, and 
human-to-human transmission is extremely rare.  End Summary.

Tick-borne disease - Animals Show no Symptoms 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  Ministry of Health Doctor Yildirim Bayazit told us that cases of 
Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) have grown to 270 for partial 
year 2006 from 263 in 2005 as a whole, affecting six Anatolia-Black 
Sea Provinces east of Ankara (Tokat, Gumushane, Amasya, Corum, 
Yozgat, and Sivas Provinces).  Both Bayazit and the European CDC 
Fact sheet (http://www.ecdc.eu.int/outbreaks/) on the disease 
suggest the possibility that the increase in cases may reflect 
greater detection, diagnosis, and notification, rather than 
increased activity of the virus.  A relatively new disease, CCHF was 
first documented in Turkey in humans in 2002. 
 
¶3.  Bayazit said that the Ministry of Agriculture (MARA) was acting 
as the lead agency in combating the disease, although they initially 
denied responsibility for responding to the tick-borne disease. 
According to Bayazit, MARA now devoted a budget of 50 million YTL 
($35 million) for CCHF.  Recent tests in cattle revealed that the 
disease was present in 80% of the cattle in the affected areas. 
Animals are just carriers for the disease and do not show symptoms 
(very much unlike avian influenza).  The reservoir for CCHF includes 
hares, birds, cattle, sheep, and goats.  The main vector for 
transmission is hard ticks of the Hayalomma genus.  The majority of 
human cases have been persons working in the livestock sector. 
 
¶4.  Bayazit emphasized the importance of preventing animal movement 
from infected areas.  He noted the particular risk of the sacrifice 
holiday, when there is normally significant movement of cattle, 
sheep, and goats. 
 
¶5.  Bayazit said that Turkey was cooperating closely with WHO which 
had recently sent a team.  The Turkey WHO rep said that Turkey's 
response to the disease had been solid and timely.  Turkey was

seriously considering a proposal from the WHO related Mediterranean 
Zoonotic Control Program that Turkey organize a three-day regional 
meeting in Istanbul in November.  The CCHF virus has been found in 
ticks in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe.  Bayazit 
said his office was focusing its efforts on public awareness for 
farmers in the region.

Comment:

¶6.  Turkey has been broadly recognized for a strong and transparent 
response to avian influenza in humans earlier this year and it has 
stepped up its readiness for future potential outbreaks or human 
pandemic influenza.  Like its efforts against avian influenza - much 
more dangerous for its economic effect on poultry and potential risk 
for transmission to humans - Turkey has organized a robust and 
transparent response for Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever, including 
good inter-agency coordination.  Turkey again could play a role as a 
regional model, building off its experience.  Turkey is interested 
in cooperation with the CDC, given the importance of tick-borne 
diseases in the U.S.  The twenty deaths this year fueled concern in 
the press, and despite the "Congo" part of the name, this disease is 
far removed from an Ebola Fever like scourge given low rates of 
contagiousness and mortality.
