SUBJECT: EUROPE: HUNGARY, PROTESTS AGAINST PRIME MINISTER; WESTERN 
HEMISPHERE: LEFTIST LEANINGS IN LATIN AMERICA 
¶1. "Western Europe Nations Become Nightmare For the EU" 
Center-right O Estado de S. Paulo's Paris correspondent remarks 
(9/22): "Violence has erupted in Budapest against socialist Prime 
 
Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany.... But there is another and much more 
important victim of such demonstrations: the European Union. Hungary 
is one of the eight Western European nations that joined the EU, and 
was the nation that moste brilliantly responded to the criteria 
demanded by Brussels to deserve its entry ticket. Once admitted, it 
unfortunately abandoned the austerity policy and shows today the 
highest budgetary deficit in Europe.... Brussels' reprimand was 
tough, the prime minister lied and the Hungarians went to the 
streets. Hungary is not an isolated case. The Western European 
nations that joined the EU have been a headache for the bloc.  These 
new members, despite being left leaning (case of Hungary) or right 
wingers (Poland), are all boats adrift that anguish the EU's 
officials.... Today, the old Europe resists and the new Europe shows 
signs of fragility.  And it can be seen that such forced and 
sometimes blindfolded enlargement of the bloc was a questionable 
idea." 
¶2. "Elections In Latam Favor Moderate Candidates" 
Business-oriented Valor Economico (9/22) editorialized: "The wave of 
elections in Latin America is nearing its end and a continent that 
is not very much different from the current one will emerge from 
them. The leftist wave was not as powerful as it seemed to be at the 
beginning, and one of its leaders, the bombastic Venezuelan 
president, Hugo Chvez, has faced problems attracting new allies in 
addition to the Bolivian indigenous leader Evo Morales. At the end, 
there are more populists than leftists, and much more moderates than 
radicals.... In practice, the Latin American elections represent a 
dam to the intents of leaders like Chvez.  The elections have shown 
the predominance of moderate trends with populist characteristics 
such as that of Kirchner in Argentina, or of politicians whose left 
leanings are diluted into a liberal practice to the point of 
becoming unnoticeable, such as the case of Uruguayan Tabar Vazquez, 
Chilean Bachelet and Lula. Even without new changes there is plenty 
of room for crises in the continent. Chvez is carrying out an 
irresponsible arms race and reducing democratic liberties in his 
nation.  Morales wants to take advantage of the Constituent 
Assembly.... In Mexico, Obrador, contrary to all evidences that 
showed him as the defeated candidate, threatened to cause a civil 
confrontation and now wants to be the president of a parallel 
government."
