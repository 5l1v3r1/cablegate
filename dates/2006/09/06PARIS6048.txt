REF: STATE 136476 
 
¶1.  In response to reftel demarche, MFA IO DAS-equivalent for 
political affairs Jean-Hughues Simon-Michel indicated to 
Deputy PolCouns September 8 that France continues to support 
inscribing Burma formally onto the UNSC agenda.  He was 
gratified to learn that the U.S. now believes it has ten 
votes lined up in favor, which he ascribed to a probable 
change in the Japanese position.  He commented briefly that, 
notwithstanding continuing Chinese opposition, it is progress 
of a sort that China now acknowledges it is concerned with 
the situation there. 
 
¶2.  When asked, Deputy PolCouns responded, per reftel, that 
the U.S. is not considering a resolution at this time.
