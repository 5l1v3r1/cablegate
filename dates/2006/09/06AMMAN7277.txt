(SBU)  Jordan's State Security Court (SSC) on September 21 
sentenced seven persons to hang, including would-be suicide 
bomber Sajidah al-Rishawi, for the November 2005 Amman Hotel 
bombings (ref A).  Rishawi, an Iraqi, confessed on Jordan TV 
days after the bombings, and then pled not guilty in early 
July.  She is the first woman ever to be sentenced to death 
by the SSC.  The other six defendants (Othman Ismail Dalimi; 
Hiam Hassan; Walid Hassan; Nihad Rishawi; Karim Jassim 
Fahdawi; and Mazen Mohammad Shehadeh) were tried in absentia, 
and are believed to be in Iraq.  The decision will be 
reviewed by the Court of Cassation, Jordan's highest.  If the 
verdict is upheld, the King must sign a death warrant before 
the execution can take place.
