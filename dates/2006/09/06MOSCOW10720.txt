¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a Pre-license check to determine 
the legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, Vtoroy 
Front Company (VF Company), Moscow, Russia. The 
company is listed on BIS license application D363051 
as the ultimate consignee of holographic sighting 
device used as uni-powered optical sight for 
consumer/tactical, firearms applications. These items 
are controlled for foreign policy reasons under ECCN 
OA987. The licensee is L-3 Communications, 1215 South

¶3. On September 13, 2006, Export Control Attache 
Donald Pearce and FSN Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested pre-license check at the offices of VF 
Company, 9/2 Gen. Glagoleva st., Moscow, Russia. The 
export control team met with Anton Linkvist, 
President. 
 
¶4. VF Company was founded in 1995 by Mr. Linkvist and 
his brother, and continues to be a family run 
business. "Vtorny Front" is Russian for "Second 
Front," and is an homage to the U.S. forces who opened 
up the western front during Second World War, a move 
seen as critical to the success of the Red Army on the 
eastern front.  VF specializes in tactical clothing 
and accessories, and is a primary contractor for 
Government of Russia (GOR) military and law 
enforcement special operations units such as the 
Federal Security Service (Russian abbreviation FSB) 
"ALPHA" unit, the Minsitry of Internal Affairs 
(Russian Abbrviaion MVD) "OMON" (Special Purpose 
Detachment of Militsia) groups, and Ministry of 
Defense "SPETSNAZ" (Special Forces) groups. VF has 
been supplying the special operations community in 
Russia since 1995.  VF also runs two hunting stores 
for clients from the general public, with hunting 
accessories and clothing.  The company employs nine, 
and is headquartered at the General Glagoleva St. 
location in an office and showroom in an inner 
courtyard of a multiple-use building.  The company has 
a low profile exterior appearance, with only a small 
sign marked "ARMY" next to the doorbell. 
 
¶5. The company partners with suppliers based on the 
quality of the goods to be sold.  VF prides itself on 
presenting only the highest quality products for 
tactical and/or hunting use.  Major brands in stock 
include US companies such as Bianchi and Alpha 
Industries.  The company participates in the annual 
"Shot Show" held in Las Vegas, Nevada, where it scouts 
new items for the market and makes contacts with U.S. 
exporters. 
 
¶6. VF plans to market the sights noted in reftel 
primarally to the law enforcement and military market, 
with possible sales to hunters. Mr. Linkvist is 
looking to start with an initial order of 30 sights, 
as he already has an order for 10-15 sights from the 
FSB ALPHA unit.  The primary role of ALPHA is 
counterterrorism, and the unit would deploy the sights 
for use in close-quarters battle situations.  NOTE: 
ALPHA is 
 
¶7. Mr. Linkvist is familiar with export controls.  VF 
has been asked to procure U.S. Munitions List items in 
the past for GOR units, and is currently researching 
the possibility of obtaining night vision scopes for 
GOR end-users.  Mr. Linkvist stressed the company 
policy of dealing only with the actual end user, and 
not "middle-men" or "wrong-looking" organizations. 
The company does no third party sales, insisting that 
the actual end user be the recipient of any 
consignment from VF. Security at the headquarters 
location consists of an electronic alarm system, with 
cameras and door/window sensors.  The doors are 
reinforced steel with a remote electronic lock/passkey 
system.  All stock is kept in a locked storeroom with 
a steel door. 
 
¶8. Recommendations: Post recommends Vtoroy Front 
Company (VF Company), Moscow, Russia, as reliable 
recipients of sensitive U.S. origin commodities. It is 
 
requested that post be notified of final disposition 
of the application, and of any shipments for this 
organization in order to conduct appropriate FCS 
follow-up and statistical reporting.
