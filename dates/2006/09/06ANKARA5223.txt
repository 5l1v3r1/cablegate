SUBJECT: UPDATED VERSION: U.S. MISSION TO TURKEY 
COMMEMORATION OF 9/11 ANNIVERSARY 
 
 
¶1.  Summary: The U.S. Mission to Turkey commemorated the 5th 
anniversary with events in Ankara, Istanbul, and Adana.  The 
post activities connected the 9/11 terrorist attacks to 
terrorist attacks on Turkey and other nations, in order to 
reinforce a theme of common determination to confront and 
defeat terrorism around the world.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  The mission's slate of activities began with an op-ed 
from Ambassador Ross Wilson, which was carried in the 
September 11 edition of the mass-circulation Turkish 
newspaper "Sabah."  In his editorial (also featured on the 
front page above the fold), the Ambassador concluded, "On 
this September 11, Americans will mourn their loss of five 
years ago and mourn all victims of terrorism.  We will seek 
ways to further our and the world's common struggle against 
those who threaten our way of life.  And we will succeed." 
In the editorial, the Ambassador also linked the 9/11 
anniversary to Turkey's own experience with terrorism, 
writing, "Prime Minister Ecevit expressed (Turkey's) 
sentiments well (after 9/11): 'We share the pain of the 
United States, our close friend and ally...All of humanity 
should be in solidarity against terrorism.' The prime 
minister's deliberately chosen words, of course, reflected 
both pain over our loss and an appeal for help in defeating 
PKK and other terrorists responsible for the loss of some 
30,000 lives over the previous decade or more....We are 
horrified by the violence perpetrated by the PKK and its 
front groups, and we grieve for the victims.  We are 
committed to working with Turkey and its friends to defeat 
the terrorists." 
 
¶3.  These themes were amplified in a morning ceremony at the 
Embassy in Ankara, where Ambassador Wilson presented a grant 
for ten thousand dollars to the general director of the 
Turkish Association for Aid and Solidarity with the Families 
of Martyrs from the Security Services (EMSAD).  "Terrorism 
affects all of us.  Nowhere is this clearer than in Turkey, 
where PKK terrorism has claimed tens of thousands of lives 
and where al-Qaeda launched devastating attacks in Istanbul 
in 2003," the Ambassador said.  "For me, our donation today 
is a way of looking forward as we look back in sorrow at the 
sad wreckage left behind by PKK, al-Qaeda and other terrorist 
violence."  EMSAD Director General Ms. Nursen Donmez 
Kiricikaya replied, "On behalf of the children of victims to 
terrorism, I want to thank the Ambassador and the US Mission 
for this generous gift.  On this anniversary we remember that 
terrorism is not just a problem for Turkey; it is the world's 
problem."  The ceremony was widely covered by Turkish 
broadcast and print media. 
 
¶4. Ambassador Wilson will reinforce the themes at a dinner 
for important business, political, academic, media, and other 
contacts this evening in Istanbul, in honor of a forthcoming 
"Scientific American" edition that will feature Turkey.  In 
his remarks, the Ambassador states: "This fifth anniversary 
reminds us of the challenge we as civilized people face to 
defend ourselves and our way of life against those who would 
destroy it and us.  They remind us that the United States 
can, must and will stand with Turkey in the struggle to 
defeat PKK and other terrorist groups and prevent the 
violence they foment." 
 
¶5. Adana U.S. Consul Eric Green visited the Adana chapters of 
two Turkish organizations representing families of policemen 
and soldiers killed in the line of duty by terrorists.  In 
his meetings, Green reinforced the themes noted above, and 
also provided his counterparts with a copy of Ambassador 
Wilson's Sabah editorial.  Local media covered one of the 
meetings. 
 
¶6.  The Embassy in Ankara, Consulate General in Istanbul, and 
Consulate in Ankara also held ceremonies for mission 
personnel and families to commemorate the fifth anniversary 
of the September 11, 2001 attacks.  In addition the Embassy 
co-sponsored a photo exhibit entitled, "Manhattan: The Magic 
of Glass and Steel," at the Turkish American Association 
headquarters in Ankara.  A/DCM Dan Sreebny will open the 
exhibit this evening, to connect the theme of the exhibit to 
the 9/11 anniversary.
