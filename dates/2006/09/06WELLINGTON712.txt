The following is post's response to questions concerning the 
pre-license check on application 05-1004255, for sale to 
Reloaders 
Supplies Ltd. of Onehunga, Auckland.  Due to limited Embassy 
staff it 
was not possible to make a site visit.  Information was 
instead 
obtained through an internet search and PE Counselor's 
telephone call to 
Ron Dent, Director of Reloaders Supplies Ltd. 
 
 
1) When was the company established and who are its 
principals? 
 
-- According to an internet search of registered NZ companies 
(www.companies.govt.nz), the company was incorporated 17 
April 1975. 
The Director is Ronald DENT. 
 
2) Who are the firm's typical customers and where are they 
located? 
 
-- According to Dent, the company sells by mail order to 
hunters across 
New Zealand.  (An Embassy search of the company website, 
www.reloaders.co.nz, found would-be buyers are instructed to 
e-mail or call 
the shop for more information about its products.) 
 
3) Does the company have an established, legitimate customer 
base to which it plans to sell these commodities? 
 
-- Mr. Dent says many customers are repeat customers.  All 
must have licenses 
to purchase firearms and ammunition. 
 
4) Does the company have adequate on-site security? 
 
-- The company is protected by police-approved alarms.  All 
are inspected 
annually by NZ Police to ensure they are sufficient and in 
working order. 
 
 
5) Does the company keep proper, detailed records of its 
sales and customers? 
 
-- The company has a record of every firearm it has sold 
since 1977. 
It's book of registered sales is inspected by NZ Police every 
six months. 
 
6) Does the company understand the restrictions on United 
States Munitions List (USML) articles, particularly regarding 
re-exporting (no re-export without USG authorization)? 
 
-- Yes.  In addition to US State Department permission, GNZ 
approval 
would be required for re-export. 
 
7) Does the company have the proper firearms license and 
import permit for the items listed on the license 
application? 
 
-- Yes.  Licenses of all NZ firearm dealers are re-issued 
annually 
following inspection of the premises. 
 
8) In post's assessment, is the company a reliable recipient 
of USML items? 
 
-- Yes.
