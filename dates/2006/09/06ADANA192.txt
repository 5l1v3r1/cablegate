in Ankara, paid a visit to the Mersin Governor and extended 
thanks on behalf of the U.S. citizens to the Turkish authorities 
and people of Mersin, who provided assistance during evacuation 
of U.S. citizens from Lebanon.  Wilson said that he was proud to 
be in Mersin and expressed that American people will always 
remember Turkey's help shown during those difficult times. 
Wilson also made statements about the PKK issue and said that 
PKK was a terrorist organization and nothing can justify its 
attacks.  Wilson expressed the U.S.'s solidarity with Turks and 
condemnation of recent PKK attacks.

that Government of Iraq should also appoint an Iraqi envoy for 
countering PKK terrorism.  It is also reported that U.S. Envoy 
for Countering Terrorism, Joseph Ralston, held his first meeting 
with the Turkish Ambassador in Washington. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:   Dan Fried, Assistant Secretary of State, 
reportedly said that cross-border attacks are not going to help 
Turkey.  Dan Fried also dismissed allegations that the U.S. 
Government was engaging in conversations with the PKK.

the government, deliberations on dispatch of Turkish troops to 
Lebanon, and the recent forest fires, reportedly fired sharp
