STRIKE 
 
 
¶1. All air traffic at Abidjan airport was halted September 26 
when Cote d'Ivoire's national air traffic controllers, the 
local branch of ASECNA, launched a strike.  Union contacts 
told us the strike was called to protest "inappropriate 
working conditions", which included outdated radar equipment 
as well as unspecified contraventions of international 
professional standards related to pay and benefits.  The 
strike, which grounded even UN flights in and out of Abidjan, 
was unannounced, and union contacts told us it is planned to 
last three days.  Controllers did make an exception to allow 
President Gbagbo and South African President Mbeki to fly to 
Ouagadougou the morning of September 26, for a 
suddenly-announced trip to meet with President Campaore of 
Burkina Faso. 
 
¶2. As of the afternoon of September 26th, the union was still 
in negotiations with the Ministry of Transport.  No word was 
available as to the progress of talks.  Contacts from Air 
France tell us that they have a flight en route from Paris 
scheduled to arrive around 1800 local time which they will 
divert to Lome if the aircraft is not allowed to land here. 
We will monitor the situation closely.
