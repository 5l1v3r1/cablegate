SUBJECT: G-8 SEEKS TO COORDINATE CT EFFORTS WITH INDIA 
 
¶1.  (U)  Summary:  G-8 officials met on August 31 to discuss 
joint efforts to strengthen counter-terrorism cooperation 
with GOI in light of a rising trend in terrorist attacks in 
recent years.  Most meeting participants stressed India's 
interest in gaining international cooperation against 
Pakistani terrorists.  The Russian chair said that while New 
Delhi has signaled its willingness to build joint efforts 
against terrorism, cooperation still suffers from the Indian 
perception that double standards place Pakistani militants 
responsible for attacks in India at a lower priority than 
efforts against Al-Qaida.  Russian officials see an upcoming 
visit (around October 6 to 13) by the G-8 Counter Terrorism 
Committee (CTED) as an opportunity to step up engagement and 
mitigate India's concerns.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Russian officials hosted a meeting with 
representatives of the G-8 on August 31 in New Delhi to 
coordinate efforts to build a better working relationship 
with India on counter-terrorism issues with India.  They 
pointed to a rising trend in terrorist attacks against soft 
targets since 2005 in India including major attacks since in 
Bangalore, Varanasi, New Delhi, and Mumbai.  Although Russian 
officials said New Delhi historically has preferred to handle 
terrorist issues internally, after the Mumbai attacks they 
say India has sought new joint efforts with the international 
community to combat terrorism on Indian soil.  They believe 
this represents a new opportunity to engage with India on 
counter-terror issues.  Russian officials said, however, that 
cooperation with New Delhi still suffers from an Indian 
perception that double standards place Pakistani militants, 
including those responsible for the recent attacks in Mumbai, 
at a lower priority in the war on terrorism than efforts 
against Al-Qaida. The Russian delegation urged G-8 members to 
work toward a joint convention on terrorism and step up 
engagement with India largely to combat this perception. 
 
¶3.  (U)  Representatives of Italy and the European Commission 
suggested that the G-8 could work with India to pass new 
money laundering legislation, an effort that would help 
strengthen India's ability to stem civilian terrorist finance 
flows.  European Commission officials are willing to offer 
India technical assistance to improve India's legislation 
designating terrorist groups and their supporters -- 
assistance the European Commission already provides to ten 
new European Union members. 
 
¶4.  (U)  Embassy PolCouns outlined U.S. efforts to engage 
India via training, a counter-terrorism dialogue, and against 
terrorism financing.  German and UK officials discussed 
India's efforts to gain more information about terrorists 
coming into India from Pakistan -- including whether there 
were new patterns of terrorists entering through Bangladesh. 
French representatives suggested that new connections between 
Kashmir-focused terrorist groups and global terrorists 
justified greater grounds for elevating our cooperation with 
New Delhi.  Canadian officials echoed French comments -- 
pointing out that of 17 Canadians recently arrested for 
plotting terrorist acts in North America, most of them had 
trained in madrassas in Pakistan. 
 
¶5. (U) Comment:  Prime Minister Singh's efforts to build 
international support behind condemnation of Pakistan after 
they July 11 Mumbai attacks appear to have gained some ground 
with European officials.  That said, the G-8's efforts 
represent an opportunity to gain greater cooperation from 
India on a variety of counter-terrorism initiatives. This 
venue may also be appropriate in pushing India to implement 
anti-money laundering legislation and meeting the 
 
NEW DELHI 00006254  002 OF 002 
 
 
requirements to gain membership in the Financial Action Task 
Force (FATF), an active international body aiming to curb 
money laundering activities.
