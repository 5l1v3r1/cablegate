Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Taiwan's approved investment in China in the first half of 
2006 shot up 35.2 percent from the corresponding period in 2005, 
totaling USD 3.56 billion and reversing a one-year decline.  Much of 
the investment comes from firms expanding existing China operations. 
 This strong growth suggests Taiwan efforts to encourage firms to 
diversify overseas investment are not succeeding.  End summary. 
 
Taiwan's first half investment in China surges 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶2. (U) Taiwan's approved investment in China in the first half of 
2006 grew 35.2 percent from the corresponding period of 2005, 
totaling US$3.56 billion, according to Taiwan's Ministry of Economic 
Affairs Investment Commission (IC).  The strong growth reversed a 
13.5-percent annual decline in 2005 and put total investment for 
2006 on track to beat 2004's record of US$6.94 billion.  Despite 
efforts by authorities to encourage businesses to diversify their 
investment, the PRC continued to be the predominant destination for 
Taiwan foreign investment.  It accounted for 66.9 percent of 
Taiwan's total outward foreign direct investment (FDI), down 
slightly from 71.1 percent for all of 2005.

East and South China Still Dominate 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) The Yangtze and Pearl River Deltas continue to be the main 
destinations for Taiwan investment in the PRC.  Jiangsu Province 
took the lead to with over 38 percent of Taiwan's investment in the 
Mainland, followed by Guangdong, Shanghai City, Zhejiang, and 
Fujian.  Together the five top areas accounted for 91 percent of 
Taiwan's China investment, the same proportion they held in 2005. 
The following chart shows the number of approved cases for each 
province with the total amount of approved investment:

Electronics Continue to Lead 
---------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) Electronic goods, components and machinery accounted for more 
than 48 percent of Taiwan's investment in the Mainland during the 
first half of the year.  Investment in computers, communications and 
audio/video equipment manufacturing was the largest single category 
with approved investment valued at US$797 million, a 67.7 percent 
increase over the previous year.  The top ten categories were all in

manufacturing industries, accounting for 80 percent of total 
investment.  The following chart shows Taiwan investment data for

Expanded Investments Play Important Role 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) The strong growth in PRC investment appears to be due in 
large part to expansion of previous investment projects, rather than 
new projects by first-time Taiwan investors in the PRC.  Many of 
these investments were financed by revenue generated in the PRC. 
Ten projects by nine large Taiwan firms with major existing 
investments in the PRC accounted for about 12 percent of total 
investment.  These are Honhai Electronics (US$100 million), Chi-Mei 
(two projects of US$60 million and US$30 million), Asustek Computer 
Inc. (US$50 million), Promate Electronics (US$50 million), and 
Gigabyte Technology (US$50 million), Formosa Chemicals and Fibre 
Corp. (US$40 million), Topply (US$20 million), and UniPresident 
Group (US$40 million). 
 
PRC Data - Smaller Decline than 2005 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶5. (U) PRC data on Taiwan investment showed a different picture. 
PRC Ministry of Foreign Commerce data showed that Taiwan realized 
investment (dollars actually spent versus approved or contracted 
investment) actually fell 12.2 percent in the first half of 2006 
from the same period last year.  This decline was smaller than the 
31.1 percent decline for 2005.  The total value of realized 
investment in the first six months of 2006 was US$1.03 billion. 
However, the PRC data for contracted Taiwan investment showed a 15.6 
percent increase to US$5.52 billion. 
 
Comment - Diversification Efforts Unsuccessful 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶6. (SBU) Except for the decline in realized Taiwan investment in 
China shown in the PRC data, the rest of the story is one of 
continued strong interest by Taiwan enterprises in expanding 
existing operations in China.  Energy shortages, rising land and 
labor costs, macro-economic controls and uncertainty about the 
Renminbi's future exchange rate appear to be doing little to slow 
Taiwan investment in the Mainland.  Taiwan authorities continuing 
efforts to encourage firms to diversify overseas investment also 
appear to be making little headway.
