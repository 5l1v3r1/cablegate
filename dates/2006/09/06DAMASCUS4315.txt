¶1.  In response to Post's diplomatic note requesting 
information solicited in reftels, the SARG notified Post on 
September 4 that Syrian FM Walid Mu'allim will head the 
Syrian delegation to UNGA, accompanied by his spouse, Sawsan 
al-Khayat.  According to the SARG's diplomatic note, other 
delegation members are:  Deputy FM Faisal Mikdad; Foreign 
Media Director Bushra Kanafani; MFA legal advisor Riad 
al-Daoudi; International Organizations Director Faisal 
al-Hamwi; FM office director Bassam al-Sabbagh; Deputy FM 
office director Hussam el-Din Ala; and Attach Hisham 
al-Qadi.  The delegation is scheduled to arrive in New York 
on September 17, departing on September 26, according to the 
SARG's diplomatic note.  The SARG did not respond to a 
request for information about translation needs, but Mu'allim 
speaks fluent English. 
 
¶2.  Additionally, Post has recently issued a visa to Deputy 
Minister for Social Affairs and Labor Issa Maldoun, who noted 
on his visa application that he planned to attend the UN's 
September 14-15 meeting on migration and development.  Still 
pending is a visa for Samir Obeido, who works in the FM's 
office and who noted on his application submitted on August 
23 that he would accompany the FM to UNGA sessions.
