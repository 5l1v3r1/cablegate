SUBJECT: FINLAND ON SERBIA'S ICTY COOPERATION 
 
REF: STATE 146343 
 
¶1. (SBU) PolChief delivered subject demarche to Balkans 
Office Director Juha Ottman on September 8.  Ottman 
responded enthusiastically, saying that the steps the US 
has suggested to Belgrade "are entirely our line as well." 
He was pleased that the US is maintaining a hard line on 
ICTY cooperation and insisting that Serbia demonstrate a 
commitment to its own "Action Play" as key conditionalities 
for moving forward toward greater integration with the EU 
and NATO. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ottman said that, from the Finnish point of view, 
Serbia clearly has not shown sufficient cooperation or the 
political will to put its Action Plan into action.  In 
particular, PM Kostunica has not publicly called for 
Mladic's arrest, and Serb authorities are not adequately 
sharing information with the ICTY, Ottman said.  The recent 
briefing from ICTY Prosecutor del Ponte's in Brussels 
confirmed the Finns' views in this regard. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Looking forward, the GOF intends to call a Troika 
meeting with Serbia in Helsinki September 29.  If no 
significant progress is made before then, the GOF and 
Troika partners will deliver a formal message to the Serbs 
along the lines of our points, laying out the various steps 
Serbia can take now to reduce its isolation and re-start 
Stabilization and Association talks with the EU.  The Finns 
will informally urge Belgrade to show concrete progress on 
ICTY cooperation before the September 29 Troika, but Ottman 
said he was not confident that any results will be 
forthcoming before then.
