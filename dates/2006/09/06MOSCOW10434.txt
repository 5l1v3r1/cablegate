RESEARCH INSTITUTE OF AVIATION, MOSCOW, RUSSIA, 
LICENSE NO. D361241 
 
REFTEL: USDOC 04242 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a Pre-license check to determine 
the legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, State 
Research Institute of Aviation, Moscow, Russia. The 
company is listed on BIS license application D361241 
as the ultimate consignee of a thermal imager, model 
thermal-eye 2000B. These items are controlled for 
national security and nuclear non-proliferation 
reasons under ECCN 6A003. The licensee is L3 
Communications Infrared Products, 13532 North Central 
Expressway, M/S, Dallas, Texas 75243. 
 
¶3. On September 6, 2006 Export Control Attache Donald 
Pearce and FSN Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested pre-license check at the offices of Russian 
Federation State Research Center, State Research 
Institute of Aviation Systems (Russian acronym 
GosNIIAS), 7 Victorenko st., Moscow, Russia. The 
export control team met with Gennady Tsibulkin, 
International Relations and German G. Sebryakov, Chief 
of Department. 
 
¶4. GosNIIAS was founded 65 years ago as the lead 
institute for research and development of aviation and 
air combat systems development.  During Soviet times, 
the Institute employed over 8000, and was primarily 
concerned with military and government projects. 
Currently GosNIIAS employs 2500, and conducts research 
and development projects in the fields of civil 
aviation, air traffic control, and information systems 
in addition to air combat systems. GosNIIAS 
participates in many international cooperative 
research projects, including projects with U.S. firm 
Rockwell-Collins/Hughes and the Federal Aviation 
Administration. 
 
¶5. The imager in reftel will be used in an automotive 
anti-collision sensor system.  The project, which is a 
collaborative project between GosNIIAS and Toyota, 
will utilize the imager to allow the system to work in 
low to no visible light and in inclement weather. 
Currently the system utilizes two CCD sensor based 
cameras for daytime use.  The addition of a small 
thermal imaging device will allow for coverage when 
light conditions prevent effective use of a CCD 
camera.  The system may also be adapted for aviation 
use, specifically to assist pilots on takeoff and 
landing to avoid collisions on runways, or in 
helicopters to avoid power lines or other low- 
visibility hazards. 
 
¶6. Three to four specialists will have access to the 
imager.  The imager will be secured in a special high- 
value equipment room with a safe.  The facility has an 
around-the-clock security regime with access limited 
to authorized persons and escorted guests. 
 
¶7. The company is familiar with export controls, as 
many aviation related materials require licenses.  All 
military projects are strictly segregated from the 
civil programs.  The imager will only be used for the 
stated program, as it is not suitable for other uses. 
 
x. Recommendations: Post recommends State Research 
Institute of Aviation, Moscow, Russia, as reliable 
recipients of sensitive U.S. origin commodities. It is 
requested that post be notified of the final 
disposition of the application, and any shipments for 
this organization in order to conduct appropriate FCS 
follow-up and statistical reporting.
