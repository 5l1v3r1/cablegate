AIT Econoffs delivered reftel points to the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs Department of International Organizations 
Chief WANG Liang-Yu on September 1.  Ms. Wang stated that 
Chinese Taipei will support extending the mandate of the 
Counter Terrorism Task Force for another two years at SOM 
III, noting, however, that on many APEC issues their low 
profile support of U.S. positions are most effective. 
Econoffs urged that, even with a low profile approach, 
Chinese Taipei should take the opportunity to express its 
support for the U.S. position in bilateral discussions.  Ms. 
Wang noted that China is seeking to split APEC issues into 
two tiers:  pure trade issues that are dealt with by all 
member economies and other broader issues, such as security, 
that should only be discussed between sovereign economies, 
thus excluding Taiwan.  She expressed appreciation that the 
USG did not support this approach.
