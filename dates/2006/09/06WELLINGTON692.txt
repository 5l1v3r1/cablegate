(SBU) Post contacted Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade 
(MFAT) officials and Minister Peters' office to convey reftel 
invitation.  Peters is out of the country recuperating from 
an illness contracted after his trip to Malaysia.  But his 
office and MFAT officials say that they are certain the 
Minister "will be keen to attend" the 5 plus 5 meeting, 
subject to sorting out his Parliamentary schedule and 
logistical arrangements.  They will discuss the timing with 
Peters once he returns to Wellington on September 5.  Post 
will advise as soon as we receive more details about Foreign 
Minister Peters' travels to New York.
