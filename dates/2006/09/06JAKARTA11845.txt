     ¶B. HUNGER STRIKE) 
 
 ¶1. (SBU) On September 19, the trial of suspects charged in 
the 2002 murder of two Americans and one Indonesian near 
Timika, Papua, resumed.  The defendants had ended their 
hunger strike (reftel) and were present except for Hardi 
Sugimol, who was recovering from an illness.  Amcit victim 
witnesses Patsy Spier and Steven Emma attended. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The court heard testimony from four Indonesian Armed 
Forces (TNI) soldiers who had responded to the shooting. 
These were Ibnu Hudaya, Yanto Harsono, and Wayan Ardana. 
Questioning by prosecutors and defense attorneys focused on 
the sequence of events during and following the ambush. 
After the testimony of each of the four witnesses, the 
defendants were offered the opportunity to respond. 
Anthonious Wamang, charged with murder, commented, "They can 
say whatever they want," and at one pointed disputed a minor 
aspect of Ardana's testimony.  The other defendants asserted 
they had nothing to say since they had not been present at 
the ambush. 
 
¶3. (U) The trial will resume on September 26.
