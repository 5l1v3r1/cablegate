¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Academics and research scientists in Guangdong, 
who are increasingly concerned about the region's serious air 
pollution but feel pressured to tone down their comments lest they 
face cuts in research funding, are interested in learning more about 
U.S. EPA's experience, especially its air quality research and 
management technologies.  Scientists acknowledge that lack of 
transparency for existing air pollution data is a major problem, 
both for research and policy making, while resource limitations 
prevent more comprehensive, long-term studies and data collection. 
Provincial and municipal government officials claim that the 
regional air quality has improved in recent years, citing what the 
academics and scientists refer to as unreliable statistics.  While 
public rhetoric is moving in the right direction, bureaucratic 
wrangling remains an obstacle as local leaders balance environmental 
concerns with the need for continued economic growth.  Chinese 
officials and academics welcome a possible U.S. TDA study on 
expanding the region's environmental monitoring network.  End 
Summary. 
 
Air Quality a High Priority Issue 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Air pollution in South China is a high priority environmental 
and political issue.  Academics and research scientists in Guangdong 
are concerned about the rapidly deteriorating air quality and 
visibility in the Pearl River Delta (PRD), especially pollutants of 
immediate concern in the PRD region such as respirable particulate 
matter (PM) and ozone.  They have published a series of papers 
containing clear data describing the severely deteriorating air 
quality in the PRD.  In contrast, provincial and municipal 
government officials claim that the regional air quality has 
improved in recent years, citing what the academics and scientists 
refer to as unreliable statistics. 
 
Data at a Premium 
----------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Lack of transparency for air pollution data is a major 
problem, both for research and policy making.  Research scientists 
must often resort to "guanxi," or personal connections, to obtain 
even limited air pollution monitoring and emissions data.  In some 
cases, they must pay to obtain the data.  Scientists believe that 
the provincial and municipal governments should more actively 
promote data sharing, starting with government-sponsored projects. 
Should the academics and researchers push the point on air quality, 
they find that their opinions are either ignored, or if voiced too 
strongly, could lead to the government stopping their funding 
altogether. 
 
Need for More Resources and Better Coordination 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶4. (SBU) A large-scale intensive field study, the Campaign of Air 
Quality Research Experiment (CARE), was conducted in the PRD this 
summer.  In July 2006, key photochemical pollutants, respirable 
particulate matter (PM), ozone, their precursors, and meteorological 
data were monitored.  More than 20 municipal Environmental 
Protection Bureau (EPB) monitoring sites in the PRD participated in 
this study in an effort to improve their understanding of the 
regional formation and transport of PM and ozone.  The CARE team 
leader said that he would like to conduct a year-round study, but 
lack of resources and coordination difficulties prevent this.  The 
team hopes that the PRD authorities and the USG will sponsor such

studies in the future. 
 
Desire to Learn More from EPA 
----------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) Researchers and even a number of South China Environmental 
Protection Bureau (EPB) officials have expressed strong interest in 
learning more about U.S. EPA's experience and its air quality 
research and management technologies, such as the Models-3 Air 
Quality Modeling System, SMOKE Emission Processing System, AIRNow 
Air Quality Forecasting and Notification System, the U.S. emissions 
trading system, and the ongoing U.S. EPA fuel quality improvement 
project in Beijing. 
 
Enthusiasm for Possible TDA Study 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) Chinese officials and scientists welcomed the idea of a U.S. 
Trade and Development Agency (TDA) feasibility study on expanding 
the PRD's monitoring network.  They also indicated that they plan to 
purchase at least some environmental monitoring equipment from U.S. 
companies. 
 
 
Comment:  Things Are Changing, Slowly 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) While the public environmental rhetoric is moving in the 
right direction (see refs A through C for PRD authorities public 
recognition of the severity of the air pollution problem), 
bureaucratic wrangling remains an obstacle as local leaders balance 
environmental concerns with the need for continued economic growth. 
Despite potential retaliation, scholars and scientists appear 
willing to continue to speak their minds and put some public 
pressure on the authorities.  While progress towards pollutant 
emission reduction is possible, rapid change is not likely.
