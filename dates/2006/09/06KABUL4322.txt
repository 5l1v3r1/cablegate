SUBJECT: PRESIDENT KARZAI ISSUES DECREE ESTABLISHING 
TRANSPARENT APPOINTMENTS MECHANISM, SATISFYING FIRST LONDON 
COMPACT BENCHMARK 
 
¶1.  (U) On September 17, four days before the deadline, 
Afghanistan met the first benchmark from the London Compact 
(Pillar II: Governance, Rule of Law, and Human Rights) when 
President Karzai issued a decree establishing a Special 
Consultative Board to recommend candidates for Presidential 
appointment to posts as provincial governor, deputy minister, 
provincial police commanders, provincial intelligence heads, 
and members of the independent civil service commission 
(IARCSC).  These posts fall below ministerial rank but lie 
outside the scope of the Civil Service Commission. 
 
¶2.  (U) The decree also named five individuals to the Special 
Consultative Board, following criteria which, according to 
UNAMA's Senior Governance Officer, Shakti Sinha, satisfy 
Compact obligations.  One member (Mr. Mohammad Farid Hamidi) 
was named from the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission 
(AIHRC) at least at the level of Commissioner, nominated by 
the AIHRC Chairperson.  Two additional persons (Mr. Enyat 
Enayatallah and Dr. M. Hashem Esmatullahi) were named by 
President Karzai, based on their standing of high repute and 
from diverse background.  A fourth person (Ms. Homa Sabri) 
was nominated by the Co-Chairs of the Joint Coordination and 
Monitoring Board (JCMB).  And the fifth person (Mr. Zakim 
Shah) was selected to serve by the previously-named members 
of the Board.  Following the preference of the JCMB, the 
Chairperson of the Board will be selected by the Board 
members themselves.
