Â¶1. (SBU) Poloff spoke with Czech MFA Deputy Director of the 
Human Rights Department Martin Boucek on September 26 to 
discuss Cuba's efforts to eliminate the UNHRC's mandate on 
Cuba. Boucek said the Czechs share U.S. concerns, and think 
the UNHRC's handling of human rights abuses in Cuba and 
Belarus will be a "crucial test" of its effectiveness. As the 
Chair on the committee on mandates, the Czechs will argue 
that all mandates, including Cuba's mandate, should remain in 
place for at least one year. Further, the Czechs strongly 
support NGO participation in UNHRC deliberations. Boucek 
anticipated tense deliberations on these issues next week, 
and said the outcome was uncertain.
