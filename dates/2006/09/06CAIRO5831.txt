 ¶1.  On September 17 emboff met with National 
Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (NTRA) Vice President 
for Policies and International Cooperation Dr. Offat Abd El 
Monsef to seek GoE support for the United States candidate to 
head the International Mobile Satellite Organizaton (IMSO). 
Dr. Abd El Monsef had no information but agreed to raise the 
issue with NTRA head Amr Bedowi (returning to Cairo September 
18) and to coordinate with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
(MFA).
