SUBJECT: TURKEY: TRADE AGREEMENT COMPLIANCE AND MONITORING 
 
REF: STATE 152063 
 
¶1. The following describes how Post is organized to monitor 
compliance with trade agreements and our efforts to monitor and 
respond to trade barrier complaints.  Answers are keyed to 
correspond to reftel questions. 
 
¶2. (A) Our Economic Section cooperates closely with Foreign 
Agricultural Service (FAS) and Foreign Commercial Service (FCS) 
offices to monitor trade agreement compliance and respond to foreign 
trade barrier complaints.  The Economic, Agricultural, and 
Commercial Counselors meet biweekly to discuss trade issues and 
coordinate responses.  Individual officers interact on a daily 
basis. 
 
¶3. (B) Post POC for compliance reporting and complaints is:  Rebecca 
¶J. Kimbrell, Economic Officer, (90)(312)455-5555 x. 2255 or 
kimbrellrj@state.gov. 
 
¶4. (C) Following are examples of how Post has responded to trade 
complaints: 
 
Rice 
---- 
 
U.S. rice importers complained that Turkey's licensing and domestic 
purchase requirements for rice imports unfairly denied them access 
to Turkey's rice market.  Our Economic Section worked with FAS to 
raise these concerns with GOT officials.  Together, we discussed the 
issue with the Foreign Trade Undersecretariat (FTU) and with the 
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA).  We coordinated 
reports back to Washington agencies and shared the information that 
we received.  We also cooperated on briefing papers and talking 
points for the Ambassador to discuss during his relevant meetings. 
When the U.S. Government decided to take the case to the WTO Dispute 
Settlement Body, we worked together to ensure that USTR had the 
information it needed to prepare for this case.  We continue to 
coordinate our communication to the GOT about this issue and FAS 
works closely with importers to monitor changes in GOT's rice import 
requirements. 
 
Pet Food 
-------- 
 
U.S. pet food importers complained that new Turkish certification 
requirements for dioxin presented an unfair barrier to trade in 
contravention of the principle of national treatment.  Through a 
series of letters and meetings with MARA and FTU officials, FAS 
succeeded in having these restrictions lifted, facilitating U.S. pet 
food imports to Turkey. 
 
Product Labeling and Standardization 
----------------------------------- 
 
Economic and FCS officers at Post coordinate with DOC and State 
Department desk officers on labeling and standards issues.  Most 
recently, DOC and State Department officers reinforced our messages 
about labeling and standardization issues during calls on FTU, 
Turkish Customs and Ministry of Trade and Industry officials.  We 
work with our contacts in Washington to draft briefings for senior 
officials and official correspondence on these issues to GOT 
officials. 
 
WTO TRIPS Compliance and IPR issues 
----------------------------------- 
 
Post concentrates a great deal of time and effort on IPR compliance. 
 In addition to required reporting, such as the Special 301 report 
and the National Trade Estimate report, our FCS and Economic 
Sections work together to monitor TRIPS Compliance and IPR-related 
complaints.  FCS and Economic Officers meet regularly with local 
PhRMA member representatives and EU and GOT officials and coordinate 
regular reporting on the issue.  We worked closely with industry and 
Washington agencies to push for the adoption of the more stringent 
pharmaceutical data protection legislation, which came into effect 
in January 2005.  In addition, we continue to monitor the GOT's 
implementation and compliance of this legislation and its TRIPS 
obligations. 
 
Patent, Copyright and Industrial Design Laws 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
Economic and FCS officers worked closely with industry, Washington 
agencies, and local NGOs to encourage the passage of Turkey's 
strengthened copyright, patent and industrial design laws.  We 
 
ANKARA 00005641  002 OF 002 
 
 
continue to meet with GOT, NGO and industry officials to ensure that 
these laws are implemented and enforced.  In addition, we continue 
to nominate GOT officials for USPTO and Washington Agency training 
programs, including Department International Visitor (IV) programs. 
 
¶5. (D)  FAS, FCS and ECON meet regularly with industry and GOT 
officials, study media and NGO reports for new information, and 
monitor the legislative agenda for updates or changes.  When we note 
changes, we ensure that we report this information to Washington 
agencies.  Most recently, we reported on changes to the strengthened 
copyright law that would have reduced penalties for infringers.  We 
alerted NGOs and government officials to our concerns and worked 
with relevant Washington agencies to ensure that our message was 
communicated in the U.S. as well as in Turkey.
