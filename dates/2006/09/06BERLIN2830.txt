¶1. (SBU) German agencies preparing for the U.S.-EU terrorism 
finance workshop this week in Helsinki met Monday September 
25, as foreshadowed ref B, to prepare for the meeting and to 
begin discussions about the next workshop, to take place 
under the 2007 German EU Presidency.  Transatlantic 
Diplomatic Fellowship German MFA officer David Fisher told 
Global Affairs Officer German agencies discussed the U.S. 
proposals in ref A, but reached no conclusion.  Germany is 
planning to host the next U.S.-EU terrorism finance workshop 
in February, but German agencies have not decided which 
issues will be the focus of their meeting.  The two German 
officials going to Helsinki -- German MFA counterterrorism 
office director Matthias Sonn and a representative from the 
Federal Office of Criminal Investigation -- will be prepared 
to meet with the U.S. delegation on the margins of the 
Helsinki workshop to discuss both sides' hopes and 
expectations for the February event.
