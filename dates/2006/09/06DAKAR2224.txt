SUBJECT: DAKAR: EMERGENCY ACTION COMMITTEE (EAC) MEETING 
 
 
¶1.  (U) The DCM convened the EAC on September 13, 2006, 
to review mission security posture due to an increase in 
violence in the Casamance area and petty theft in Dakar. 
The EAC deemed the current security posture appropriate 
in Dakar.  In light of recent banditry and rebel activity 
in the Casamance, the EAC recommended limiting 
nonessential travel north of Ziguinchor in the Ziguinchor 
region. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The EAC agreed that a warden message pertaining 
to these topics should be issued.  Additionally, RSO will 
issue a Security Notice underlining the need for 
increased vigilance while in Dakar. 
 
¶3.  (U) Dakar's EAC will continue to monitor the local 
situation, maintain liaison with host-government police 
and security officials, and reconvene as appropriate.
