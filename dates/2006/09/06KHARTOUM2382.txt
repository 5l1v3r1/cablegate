SUBJECT:  Impact of Sudanese Travel Restriction on USG 
  Operations in Sudan 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY:  The September 24 decision of President Bashir to 
restrict all travel by official visitors to 25 kilometers from 
Khartoum will have a severe impact on USG operations.  The impact 
will be immediate.  Should this restriction be continued, Embassy 
Khartoum will have to adjust staffing patterns and consider 
curtailing some programs and operations.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  The U.S. mission in Khartoum operates with 43 U.S. resident 
staff and approximately 40 TDY personnel at any given time.  The 
travel restriction does not apply to resident staff, but it does 
apply to all TDY personnel, including those who fill permanent 
positions on a rotational basis.  While this restriction will have 
only a marginal impact on operations in Khartoum, it will hamper 
operations in Juba and cripple operations in Darfur. 
 
¶3.  USAID will be the agency that will feel the greatest negative 
impact.  USAID currently has only three resident staff in country, 
but often as many as 20 TDY personnel.  There are now five TDY staff 
assigned to USAID operations in Darfur, nine assigned to support 
USAID in Khartoum, and ten in Juba.  If these restrictions continue, 
no departing TDY personnel in either Darfur or Juba could be 
replaced by TDY personnel.  At risk is USAID's ability to monitor 
humanitarian and development programs currently funded at 
approximately $800 million. 
 
¶4.  The restrictions would prevent further support by DOD personnel 
for the peacekeeping operation in Darfur.  Currently three officers 
are in Darfur in TDY status, and their scheduled replacements have 
neither visas nor travel permits for Darfur. 
 
¶5.  During the last three months, S/CRS has staffed mission 
operations in El Fasher with three TDY personnel, who have regularly 
traveled between Khartoum and El Fasher.  These restrictions will 
prohibit any travel to Darfur by the two officers assigned to 
replace them. 
 
¶6.  Most State Department operations outside of Khartoum are 
conducted by resident staff, but some functions are performed by TDY 
personnel.  For example, the Refugee Affairs Coordinator from 
Embassy Addis Ababa travels to several locations in Sudan.  Also, 
post receives regional assistance from Cairo and Nairobi for medical 
services and facilities management. 
 
¶7.  Embassy Khartoum is preparing a response plan that will result 
in an increase in resident staff in Khartoum and in some shifting of 
responsibilities.  First, several of the functions now performed by 
USAID TDY personnel will be shifted to newly created NSDD-38 
positions, but implementing this change will require personnel to be 
assigned to Khartoum.  Second, to a limited extent we can shift work 
by changing assignments internally; for example, using S/CRS TDY 
staff in Khartoum and deploying a political officer assigned to 
Khartoum to work in Darfur.  In the event these restrictions 
continue for a lengthy period, we will have to review our ability to 
manage programs within these restrictions and perhaps recommend 
curtailing some programs and operations. 
 
¶8.  On September 27 MFA Under Secretary Mutriff Siddig told Charge 
Hume that although he appreciated the Embassy's related diplomatic 
note, he could not take immediate action to drop this restriction. 
 
¶9.  Furthermore, in granting country clearance requests Embassy 
Khartoum will explicitly inform all official travelers of this new 
restriction, which may in some cases nullify the purpose for the 
official travel.
