SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION - VENEZUELA'S UNSC CANDIDACY 
 
 
On September 20, independent "Radio Infinita" interviewed Chile's 
former Ambassador to the United States Genaro Arriagada about 
Venezuela's bid to the UNSC and his view of what to expect from the 
United States in terms of pressure. Following is an excerpt of 
Arriagada's answer: 
 
"I believe the United States makes many (foreign) policy mistakes, 
but it has a very sophisticated diplomacy.  It knows that the worst 
thing it could do is appear to be exerting pressure.  I believe that 
the attitude, for example, of the U.S. Ambassador in Chile (Craig 
Kelly) has been very discreet and therefore that it will continue 
like that.... The Republican administration has welcomed these 
incidents with Chavez.  They help Bush, because he appears as the 
moderate one... Chavez' statements and his support of Iran's uranium 
enrichment program strengthen Bush.  Therefore, Bush is winning, 
based on his adversary's mistakes and unacceptable behavior."
