REF: JAKARTA 11845 (TNI PERSONNEL TESTIFY) 
 
¶1. (SBU) On September 26, the trial of suspects charged in 
the 2002 murder of two Americans and one Indonesian near 
Timika, Papua, resumed.  It emerged that there was either a 
misunderstanding or a disagreement between the prosecution 
and defense teams about the order of the day's testimony. 
The prosecution intended to call three Indonesian victim 
witnesses, drivers working for Freeport who had been present 
during the ambush.  However, because of logistical 
difficulties involved in locating them and bringing them to 
Jakarta, the prosecution could not produce these witnesses 
until September 29.  The prosecution suggested the day's 
session be used instead for defense witnesses.  The defense 
team objected to this, saying their witnesses were not ready, 
and should not appear in any case until all victim witnesses 
had testified.  The judge then adjourned the trial until 
September 29, instructing both the defense and the 
prosecution to have witnesses prepared to testify at that 
time.  Ms. Patsy Spier attended the session as usual. 
 
¶2. (SBU) There was also some discussion of the health of the 
defendant Hardi Sugimol, who, according to prosecutors, was 
recovering from an illness and therefore not present.  They 
produced a letter from a doctor to this effect.  This 
statement was contested by the defense, who claimed that 
Sugimol was sick but was not recovering because he had not 
received proper medical attention.  The defense demanded to 
see the doctor's letter.  In all, these proceedings took 
about an hour. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Papuans attending the trial demonstrated loudly both 
before and during today's session.  In the courtroom, they 
sang, chanted and ranted against the court, calling for the 
removal of the judge and promising to return in greater 
numbers on Friday.  The prosecution advised us afterwards to 
take extra precautions for Ms. Spier when she attends the 
next session.  We are taking the necessary steps.
