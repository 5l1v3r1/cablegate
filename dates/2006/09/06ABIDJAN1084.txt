SUBJECT: COTE D'IVOIRE: BANK EMPLOYEES GO ON STRIKE 
 
REF: A. ABIDJAN 812 B. ABIDJAN 1083 
 
¶1.  On September 27, the National Union of Employees of the 
Banking and Financial Establishments in Cote d'Ivoire 
(SYNABEFA-CI) went on strike for 72 hours, making good on a 
threat issued on July 25 (reftel A).  To maximize the impact, 
the strike was evidently timed to coincide with the monthly 
deposit of salaries, making it impossible for salaried 
workers to withdraw their pay.  The strike was unannounced, 
but since little progress had been made in negotiations 
between the union and industry management with regard to 
employees' demands for a pay review, it was not unexpected. 
(Note: As much as 80% of the banking sector is owned by 
French banking interests.  Non French-owned banks  here, such 
as Standard Chartered Bank and Citibank, have been hit by the 
strike as well, despite their reputation for paying better 
salaries than their competitors.  End Note) 
 
¶2.  Comment:  While it is not unusual in Cote d'Ivoire for a 
particular union to be on strike at any time, usually over 
demands for pay increases, this particular strike effectively 
targets everyone earning a salary in Abidjan, thus putting 
pressure on the government to facilitate a rapid solution. 
This strike, together with the air-traffic controllers strike 
(reftel B) and the threat announced today of a possible 
customs agents' strike next week could easily complicate an 
already tense political situation.  End comment.
