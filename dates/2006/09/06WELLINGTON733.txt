(U) Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission David Keegan, for 
reason 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C) SUMMARY:  U.S. officials are interested in 
participating in a U.S. special session proposed by the 
Pacific Island Forum (PIF), EAP/ANP Director Steven McGann 
told the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) at a 
September 12 meeting in Wellington.  McGann and MFAT agreed 
the USG and GNZ should work together to develop a PIF agenda 
that focuses on donor coordination, security coordination and 
transnational crime.  MFAT remains concerned that 
China-Taiwan competition threatens GNZ efforts to promote 
good governance in the region, and worries as well about 
potential instability in Papua New Guinea, the Solomon 
Islands and Fiji.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (C) Identifying poverty as the Pacific Island region's 
most significant issue, MFAT Director for Pacific Affairs 
Heather Riddell told McGann and EAP/ANP Econoff Alisa Wong 
that the Pacific is second only to sub-Saharan Africa in 
being least able to meet Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 
for good governance and economic development.  She reiterated 
New Zealand concern that competition between China and Taiwan 
is undermining GNZ's efforts to promote good governance in 
the region.  McGann agreed, and said he had discussed this 
issue with Chinese officials during his April trip to Beijing 
(Ref B).  Riddell said MFAT officials have also spoken with 
the Chinese, including during Vice Foreign Minister He 
Yafei's trip to Wellington earlier in the year (Ref C). 
NZAID officials have also traveled to Taiwan to deliver "a 
stern message" to Taiwan officials. McGann said that "China 
and Taiwan need to participate in a framework approved by 
regional partners and the PICs themselves." 
 
¶3. (C) Niels Holm, MFAT Deputy Director for Pacific Regional 
Affairs, said that although the PRC says the right things 
regarding responsible development, it practices the opposite 
when it comes, as it almost always does, to competing with 
Taiwan.  He added that although most Chinese migration and 
transnational crime are beyond the Chinese government's 
oversight, they have real potential to exacerbate poverty in 
the PICs.  GNZ's message to Pacific Island leaders is that 
they need to ensure their countries are not the weak links in 
regional law enforcement and security. McGann agreed, noting 
that it was not ethnic Fijians that introduced 
methamphetamine to Fiji, but organized crime based out of 
Mainland China. Holm said GNZ is drafting a strategy paper on 
countering PRC negative influence in the region, including 
through approaches to senior leaders.  They are also trying 
to work with PRC think tanks, although NZ's Beijing embassy 
says this has not been effective as the PRC central 
government tends to control the think tanks' work.  Riddell 
reemphasized NZ's desire to work with us to deliver 
consistant messages to China and Taiwan. 
 
¶4. (C) McGann was pleasantly surprised to learn that GNZ was 
the originator of PIF Secretary General Greg Urwin's proposal 
to hold a special U.S session on the final day of PIF Leaders 
meeting in Nadi, Fiji on October 25 (ref D).  Riddell and 
McGann agreed this could be a more constructive meeting than 
the Post Forum Dialogue (PFD) and NZ and US officials should 
work together to quickly develop an agenda.    McGann 
suggested one goal should be to get China to take more 
responsibility for Chinese-originated crime in the PICs. 
Riddell suggested that regional research and development into 
identifying feasible fossil fuel alternatives might be 
another area for discussion.  Speaking of the PFD, Holm said 
that for years partners had not gotten enough from the 
session, and it will be important to find a way to give more 
attention to dialogue with major players such as the United 
States in order to ensure that senior respresentatives from 
dialogue partners continue to attend the PIF.  Leaders will 
hopefully decide at this year's PIF on a more substantive

process to engage third country partners. 
 
¶5. (C) Riddell and McGann next reviewed the situation in 
Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Fiji.  On PNG, Riddell 
suggested that the Expanded Cooperation Program (ECP) is 
helping to push back the state of emergency in the Southern 
Highlands but can do no more than preserve the long-standing 
dysfunctional society.  Riddell said the commission of 
inquiry into the cause of the Solomon Island riots was having 
some "push back" effect on the Regional Assistance Mission to 
the Solomon Islands (RAMSI).  She agreed to provide the DCM 
with a more detailed GNZ assessment of Taiwan's role in the 
inquiry before his September 19 lunch with Taiwan's trade rep 
in Wellington.  Riddell said New Zealand believes the new 
government in Fiji has contributed to a more stable 
environment, but cited disagreement on foreshore ownership as 
a potential cause of political instability.
