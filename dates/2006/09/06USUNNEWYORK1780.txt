¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY. Secretary-General Annan set a somber tone 
at the September 11 Security Council Debate on Darfur, 
beseeching the Council to assert itself in response to the 
'death and suffering, perhaps on a catastrophic scale' 
confronting the people of Darfur.  SYG Annan had harsh words 
for the Sudanese Government of National Unity (GNU), 
denouncing its offensive in North Darfur and its persistent 
obstructionism in implementing UNSCR 1706.  The 
representative of the Sudanese Mission accused the UN and the 
Council of ignoring GNU efforts to address the Darfur 
situation and swore to continue these efforts as a means of 
implementing the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA).  SC Members 
spoke against the GNU's proposed military solution, called 
for the GNU to give its consent for the deployment of UN 
forces per UNSCR 1706 and looked forward to the September 18 
African Union (AU) Peace and Security Council (PSC) 
Ministerial meeting on extending AMIS' mandate; the AU did 
not speak at today's meeting.  Full texts of participants' 
statements can be found ref A.  USUN circulated a draft 
Presidential Statement for adoption by September 15; text in 
Paragraph 7.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) SYG Annan, accompanied by DPKO U/SYG Guehenno and 
A/SYG Annabi, was clear in his condemnation of the GNU's 
'legally and morally unacceptable' offensive in North Darfur, 
which now includes aerial bombing, and in his denunciation of 
the effects it was having on humanitarian operations and 
population displacements.  Annan was also clear about his 
exasperation with the GNU over its failure to consent to UN 
forces in Darfur according to UNSCR 1706, passing the torch 
instead to the Security Council to assert its authority by 
sending a 'clear, strong and uniform message' to influence 
the GNU.  USUN Pol Mins-Couns announced U.S. plans to 
circulate a draft PRST to convey Council unity in seeking GNU 
cooperation in the implementation of UNSCR 1706.  An Experts 
Meeting on the draft PRST is scheduled for September 13, with 
adoption sought by September 15. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Other Members echoed the SYG's dismissal of the 
GNU's plan for the stabilization of Darfur as an 
inappropriate military solution to a crisis that demanded a 
political answer.  Delegates from Congo, Tanzania, and 
(notably) Russia were emphatic that a military solution would 
only complicate the Darfur situation, with Tanzanian PR 
Mahiga reprimanding that the GNU should know better, 
especially after its experience in the North-South war. 
Representatives of Slovakia, Denmark and Greece warned that 
of the situations in Rwanda and in Srebrenica should serve as 
reminders for the Council of what can happen when a situation 
like that in Darfur is left unchecked. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Sudanese representative gave an illogical litany 
of examples where Sudan deemed the Council had willfully 
ignored Sudanese attempts at crisis resolution in Darfur, 
including the GNU's list of DPA violators to be considered 
for sanctions and its submitted plan for the stabilization of 
Darfur.  The Sudanese delegate accused the Council of 
forgoing the path of dialogue on Darfur to which the GNU, by 
contrast, was 'committed.'  USUN Pol Mins-Couns rebutted this 
charge, pointing out that it was the GNU which had opted out 
of the August 28 Security Council meeting on Darfur and 
regretting the Sudanese representative's failure to mention 
GNU acceptance of UNSCR 1706. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The delegates of the Arab League and the 
Organization of the Islamic Conference reasserted the need 
for GNU consent for UN Darfur deployment, but other Members 
pushed back.  The Congolese and Peruvian representatives 
expressed regret that GNU agreement to deploy UN forces into 
 
USUN NEW Y 00001780  002.2 OF 003 
 
 
Darfur had not been forthcoming.  Danish PR Loj raised the 
possibility of expanding political and economic sanctions 
against the GNU for its continued intransigence.  In the 
meantime, a majority of Council delegations (including PRs of 
the UK, Greece and Russia) expressed widespread support for 
an extension by the AU PSC of AMIS's mandate until the end of 
the year to avoid a power vacuum in Darfur. 
 
¶6. (SBU) The AU was represented by a Senior Political Officer 
of its Mission, who did not make remarks in the meeting, 
claiming that she had not received instructions from the AU 
Commission in advance of the meeting.  She did confirm, 
however, that AU Peace and Security Commissioner Djinnit 
would be in New York September 14 for meetings with the UN in 
advance of the September 18 Ministerial meeting of the AU 
PSC, which would decide on AMIS' future mandate, widely 
expected to be extended to December 31.  Rumors of a 
September 19 Heads of State meeting on Darfur circulated 
among Members; Congo had reportedly proposed the idea of such 
a session to France in order to address both Sudan/Darfur and 
Cote D'Ivoire.  Most delegations seemed informally supportive 
of the proposal. 
 
¶7. Begin draft PRST text: 
 
The Security Council deplores the ongoing violence in Darfur 
and the consequent deterioration of the humanitarian 
situation, and reiterates its deep concern about the security 
of civilians and humanitarian aid workers and about 
humanitarian access to populations in need.  It calls on all 
groups in Darfur to refrain from violent attacks and demands 
that all parties to the Darfur Peace Agreement of 5 May 2006 
and the N'Djamena Agreement on Humanitarian Cease-Fire on the 
Conflict in Darfur of 8 April 2004, including the Government 
of National Unity, abide by the provisions of these 
Agreements in order to achieve lasting peace in Darfur and 
ensure regional stability. 
 
The Security Council commends the African Union for its 
efforts to find a solution to the crisis in Darfur, in 
particular the important contributions of the African Union 
Mission in the Sudan (AMIS).  It recalls the provisions of 
Operative Paragraph 5 of Security Council Resolution 1706 and 
the decisions of the African Union Peace and Security Council 
regarding transition of AMIS to a United Nations operation in 
its communiqus of 12 January, 10 March, 15 May and 27 June 
¶2006.  The Security Council reiterates its support for the 
African Union and reaffirms its endorsement of the decisions 
of the African Union Peace and Security Council, including 
transition of AMIS to a United Nations operation. 
 
The Security Council welcomes efforts undertaken by the 
Secretary-General, senior United Nations officials, Member 
 
SIPDIS 
States, and regional and international organizations to 
engage the Government of National Unity on questions 
regarding AMIS transition.  It reiterates its commitment, as 
demonstrated in its mission to the Sudan and Chad of 4-10 
June 2006 and in its meetings of 28 August and 11 September 
2006, to maintain dialogue with the Government of National 
Unity on issues concerning Darfur, and in this regard calls 
upon the Government of National Unity to cooperate in the 
full and expeditious implementation of Resolution 1706.  The 
Security Council further encourages those individual, 
regional and international parties involved in the peace 
process in the Sudan to avail themselves of all opportunities 
to engage with the Government of National Unity on this issue. 
 
The Security Council welcomes the cooperation of the 
Government of National Unity in the deployment and work of 
the United Nations Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS) in the 
southern part of the Sudan.  It reiterates its commitment to 
the principles of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement of 9 
 
USUN NEW Y 00001780  003.2 OF 003 
 
 
January 2005, reaffirms its support for the sovereignty, 
unity, independence and territorial integrity of the Sudan, 
and expresses its intention to uphold these principles during 
the transition of AMIS to a United Nations operation. 
 
The Security Council requests the Secretary-General to 
continue consulting jointly with the African Union, in close 
consultation with the Security Council, and in cooperation 
and close consultation with the parties to the Darfur Peace 
Agreement, including the Government of National Unity, on 
matters concerning the transition of AMIS to a United Nations 
operation consistent with resolution 1706, and stresses that 
the United Nations operation in Darfur will have a strong 
African participation and character.
