¶1. (SBU) Summary.  Pol/Econ Chief discussed reftel 
points on Iran and other GAERC agenda items with 
Kristina Meius, the MFA's European Correspondent, ON 
September 13.  Meius noted there are "no surprises" on 
the GOE's position on the agenda items.  She provided 
feedback on the following issues: 
 
¶2. (SBU) Iran:  The GOE supports the role of the UNSC in 
resolving the nuclear issue and reiterated GOE regret 
that Iran has not utilized the EU3+3 to make progress. 
The international community must stand united with a 
clear message on Iranian compliance.  The GOE is also 
concerned about the human rights situation in Iran. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Iraq:  The GOE welcomes progress in forming the 
International Compact with Iraq.  It is important that 
Iraqis have ownership of the International Compact and 
that the process be inclusive.  Estonia will attend the 
September 18 UNGA Compact briefing, however, it is not 
likely the FM will participate. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Middle East Peace Process:  GOE believes there 
must be a comprehensive settlement with a negotiated 
two-state solution and that the EU has an important role 
to play in this process.  UNIFIL needs to be 
strengthened and UNSC 1701 should be fully implemented. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Sudan:  The GOE is concerned about the 
deterioration of the situation in Sudan and condemns the 
violation of the ceasefire by the parties.  The GOE has 
provided $64,700 in assistance to Sudan. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Congo:  The GOE hopes Solana will brief the 
Council about his September 11-12 trip to the Congo. 
The GOE is looking forward to an orderly conclusion of 
the election process, and would welcome progress on 
confidence building and a reduction in tension between 
the two candidates.  Estonia has provided four election 
observers in the Congo. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Western Balkans:  The GOE expects a short 
discussion on the western Balkans before the Council 
adopts Conclusions.  Estonia sent one election observer 
to Montenegro, and believes the elections were peaceful 
and in accordance with international standards.  The GOE 
hopes the new government will begin to work on the 
European reform agenda and would welcome the re-launch 
of Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) 
negotiations.  With respect to Bosnia, the GOE hopes to 
see more effort on constitutional reforms and plans to 
send two election observers.  On Kosovo, the GOE 
supports Ahtisaari's objective of concluding the status 
process this year.  (Note:  Meius added that while the 
Council would discuss this, "everyone knows there will 
be no outcome.")
