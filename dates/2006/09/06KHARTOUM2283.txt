Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  On September 3, Government of National Unity (GNU) officials 
announced that several backyard chicken flocks in Juba had been 
found to be infected by Avian Influenza (AI) H5N1.  This is the 
first time Southern Sudan has confirmed cases of H5N1.  At this time 
no new cases of AI have been reported in humans or poultry in any of 
the northern states.  Additionally, the GNU is taking steps to 
tighten requirements for poultry farms and the importation of 
fertilized eggs in order to prevent the spread of AI.  End summary. 
 
 
---------------------- 
Status of AI in Juba 
---------------------- 
 
¶2.  At the beginning of August, Juba-based health officials received 
reports of illness and death in chickens in Hai Jalaba, Juba, and 
initiated an investigation.  Chickens and ducks at several homes 
were suspected to have AI, and specimens from living and dead birds 
were collected and sent for analysis. 
 
¶3.  On September 3, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) 
convened a Technical Task Force meeting on AI.  At the meeting it 
was announced that the two batches of samples collected from 
domesticated poultry in Juba on August 4 had tested positive for AI 
type A at the Central Veterinary Research Laboratory (CVRL) in 
Khartoum.  After further analysis in the United Kingdom (UK), the 
samples were found to be positive for H5N1.  This is the first time 
Southern Sudan has confirmed cases of H5N1.  According to the UK 
laboratory's report, the Juba samples had a slight variation to the 
most common sequence of H5N1.  Further analysis will be performed on 
the samples in the UK. 
 
¶4.  According to FAO officials, there is no large-scale poultry 
farming in Central Equatoria State, but it is common for people in 
Juba to keep chickens and ducks, which range freely in communal 
areas.  Juba reportedly receives commercial poultry products from 
northern Sudan and Uganda. 
 
--------------------- 
Status of AI in Sudan 
--------------------- 
 
¶5.  At this time no new cases of AI have been reported in humans or 
poultry in any of the northern states. 
 
¶6.  In late August, blood samples from dead wild birds were 
collected by the GNU Wildlife Administration Authorities in White 
Nile State.  On September 10, the Federal Ministry of Animal 
Resources and Fisheries (FMARF) announced that these samples will be 
taken to CVRL in Khartoum for testing and if necessary sent to the 
UK for further analysis. 
 
¶7.  Recently the GNU has tightened requirements for poultry farms to 
ensure they meet bio-security standards.  At the September 3 
meeting, FMARF and the Khartoum State Ministry of Agriculture stated 
that licenses will now be required for the importation of fertilized 
eggs in order to prevent the introduction of AI into Sudan.  The 
ministries recommend that eggs be imported from the Netherlands, UK, 
or Germany.  Farms have already begun to import eggs to restock and 
continue to upgrade their bio-security measures. 
 
¶8.  At the September 3 meeting, a representative from the GNU 
Poultry Chamber of Commerce stated that the increased expense of 
importing fertilized eggs from the recommended countries may have a 
negative impact on the industry.  Industry representatives are 
concerned that Sudan's demand for imported fertilized eggs will 
exceed the supply from the three recommended countries. 
Additionally, the price for the imported eggs from the European 
sources is estimated to exceed the price of Egyptian eggs, which was 
the most common source before the new regulations. 
 
¶9.  The GNU has approved a 40 percent compensation plan for poultry 
lost due to culling from May to July.  As of September 3, the GNU 
has not announced a national compensation policy for new poultry 
losses occurring after July.

¶10.  At the meeting, the FMARF reported that the AI surveillance 
system lacked efficiency.  USAID staff report that the federal 
ministries, state ministries, and CVRL need to better coordinate 
reporting farm data, collecting samples, and leading appropriate 
control measures. 
 
¶11.  A team from FAO and FMARF plans to travel to Juba to assess the 
AI situation and to develop a surveillance system. 
 
----------------------------------- 
U.S. Government (USG) Contributions 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶12.  The USG deployed a consultant to the FAO, who is posted at the 
FMARF, to assist in AI control activities for three months.  The 
consultant will assist with the establishment and training of a 
Rapid Response Team and will provide epidemiology training for GNU 
veterinary staff.   The consultant will visit Southern Sudan and may 
conduct additional training there. 
 
¶13.  Following the confirmation of AI cases in northern Sudan, USAID 
has coordinated with the Government of Southern Sudan (GOSS), UN 
agencies, and other relevant stakeholders on an AI preparedness 
response.  In April 2006, USAID collaborated with the FAO, FMARF, 
and the Ministry of Health (MOH) to establish an AI Task Force. 
USAID has also provided technical support for drafting the GOSS AI 
preparedness and response plan, as well as other communication 
materials.  In collaboration with the U.S. Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC), USAID has provided AI training to 
FMARF and MOH staff in Entebbe, Uganda, and Nairobi, Kenya. 
Additionally, USAID has donated 500 personal protective equipment 
items to FAO in Southern Sudan, which will be positioned in areas at 
risk of AI.

Comment

¶14.  Following the reporting of positive cases of H5N1 in Juba, 
USAID is coordinating with CDC, the Department of State, and the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture to help the GOSS and UN agencies in 
Southern Sudan further investigate the outbreak and respond 
appropriately.
