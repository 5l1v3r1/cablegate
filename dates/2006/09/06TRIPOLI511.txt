PLANNING 
 
¶1.  Summary:  On September 13, 2006 ESTH Officer met with Dr. 
Abul-Hakim Al-Waer, Secretary of the Libyan Environment 
Authority (LEA), or as he joked with, "The EPA without the 
protection."  The meeting took place on the margins of the 
ongoing NDF Chemical Weapons Destruction Assistance Program. 
Dr. Waer mentioned specifically that the LEA had been charged 
with destroying/incinerating/neutralizing several caustic and 
hazardous agents/wastes in accordance with various environmental 
agreements to which they had either signed, or aspire to sign. 
These items for destruction included PCB's, transformer oil, 
pesticides left from Italian residents in the 1930's, and 
hazardous medical wastes.  He inquired as to the utility of the 
CWD incinerator and neutralization equipment in such an 
operation.  The incinerator and neutralization equipment being 
installed for the chemical weapon and precursor destruction 
activities is not technically sufficient to provide this sort of 
service.  In addition, its proposed remote location in the 
Libyan desert would not lend itself as a practical solution to 
the LEA's responsibilities.    Dr. Waer desires to establish a 
solution to the immediate problem of existing waste stockpiles, 
with additional consideration of disposing of future waste.  Dr. 
Waer said he had a budget of LD 57 Million in 2007 funds to 
address this disposal problem, (including PCB's, Medical Waste 
and other hazardous wastes) and would be seeking solutions in 
2007/2008.  End Summary. 
 
---------- 
PCB's Deemed Toughest to Destroy 
-------- 
 
¶2.  According to the NDF team's chemical experts attending the 
meeting, the PCB's are the toughest to destroy of the materials 
he listed.  Dr. Waer mentioned the Government of Libya (GOL) 
might subcontract PCB disposal to a country with existing 
expertise.  He cited that Libya routinely provided transit 
rights through its territorial waters to South Korean vessels 
carrying PCB's  enroute to France for destruction.  Considering 
South Korea's technical prowess, and the fact that they 
subcontract this work, Dr. Waer believed it would be fruitless 
to pursue such technologies internally. 
 
--------- 
Medical Waste First Priority 
--------- 
 
¶3.  The medical waste, however, Libya intends to process 
locally.  Dr. Waer discussed creating mobile station operations 
or establishing collection routes for a central disposal 
facility, but did not have a concrete idea as to how the LEA 
might establish such a program.  Embassy requests any expression 
of interest in cooperating with the LEA on this issue.  Dr. Waer 
indicated that Liquid Clinical Waste from medical facilities was 
the primary concern as the existing stores were a burden to 
contain  and that this category of waste is continually 
generated. 
 
--------- 
Future Steps: 
--------- 
 
¶4.  ESTH Officer requested a meeting with Dr. Waer to further 
discuss where the U.S. may be able to offer guidance either 
through assisting in establishing legislation on waste disposal 
(whether medical or industrial) or offering technical expertise 
in planning and/or funding.  Pending HHS and OES interest in 
such a dialogue, Embassy will engage as appropriate.
