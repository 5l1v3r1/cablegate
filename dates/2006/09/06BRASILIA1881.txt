¶1.  On August 31, 2006, Embassy delivered to Secretary Everton F. 
Lucero, Head of the Division of Science and Technology, Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs (DCTEC/MFA), for review and approval, the National 
Institutes of Health's (NIH) proposed award of a research project 
titled "CCASAnet Caribbean Central and South America Network," 
(number 1 U01 AI 069923 01).  The site covered in this project is 
under the direction of Dr. Mauro Schechter, from the Federal 
University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 
 
¶2.  The Embassy sees no adverse foreign policy implications with 
respect to this research project.  We emphasize the importance of 
complying with Brazilian laws on the export of data and biological 
material. 
 
¶3.  We are providing this assessment of foreign policy implications 
in advance of receiving approval from the Brazilian Government for 
the proposed research to go forward, in order to assist NIH in 
completing the domestic review process.  Upon receipt of Brazilian 
approval, the Embassy will notify NIH by cable.
