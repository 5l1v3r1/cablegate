¶1.  EC contacts confirm that EC President Jose Manuel Barroso 
and European Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian 
Aid Louis Michel will arrive in Sudan on September 30. 
Barroso and Michel will travel to El Fasher the same day to 
meet with AMIS commanders and the humanitarian assistance 
community.  The mission's goal is to underline EU support for 
the African Union (AU). 
 
¶2.  The EC is optimistic that President Bashir will also 
agree to a meeting with the delegation.  In a September 25 
phone call with Poloff, EC Political Advisor Jacques Prade 
said that Barroso and Michel would tell Bashir that the EU is 
concerned the Sudanese government's actions are undermining 
the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA).  In addition, they would 
urge Bashir to accept UN Security Council Resolution 1706 and 
grant humanitarian organizations complete access to Darfur. 
They may also meet with First Vice President Salva Kiir. 
 
¶3.  On October 2, Barroso and Michel will join 15 European 
Commissioners in Addis Ababa for a joint session with the AU 
Commission.
