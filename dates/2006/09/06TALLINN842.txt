¶1. (U) Ambassador Wos delivered A/S Fried's invitation 
letter to lunch with the Secretary on the margins of UNGA 
to Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet on Monday, 
September 11.  Paet said that he was already aware of the 
lunch and it was on his agenda for the trip. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On the subject of re-authorization of Estonia's 
military mandate in Iraq, Paet indicated that he did not 
anticipate a problem with the re-authorization getting 
through parliament provided that there is a renewed UN 
mandate.  (Note:  Parliamentary members have told us they 
expect the debate on the mandate to take place in November. 
End note.)
