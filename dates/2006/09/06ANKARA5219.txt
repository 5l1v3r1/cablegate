SUBJECT: TURKISH DELEGATION TRAVELING TO HAVANA NAM MEETING 
TO LOBBY FOR 2009-2010 TURKISH UNSC SEAT 
 
REF: STATE 145242 
 
¶1. (SBU)  We spoke September 8 with Turkish MFA Deputy 
Director General (DAS equivalent) for the Americas Murat 
Esenli about the upcoming Havana Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) 
Summit.  Esenli affirmed that the Turks had received an 
invitation from the Cubans.  After consulting with his 
colleagues in the International Organizations Department, he 
confirmed that the GOT would be sending a delegation because 
it constituted an unusual opportunity to lobby senior level 
government officials from a number of countries on behalf of 
Turkey's candidacy for a non-permanent UNSC seat for 
2009-2010. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  The Turkish delegation would consist of State 
Minister and Deputy PM Abdullatif Sener, Turkey's roving 
Ambassador in charge of their UNSC candidacy and their 
Director General (A/S equivalent) for International 
Organizations. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  We made it clear that we would not be attending and 
pointed to the risk that Cuba could exploit Summit 
attendance.  (Note:  On Venezuela, the Turks are well aware 
of our position.  End note.)  Esenli acknowledged this, but 
said they would focus on recruiting support.  In addition, 
the Turks want to ensure that no untoward language creeps 
into NAM communiques, particularly on Cyprus.
