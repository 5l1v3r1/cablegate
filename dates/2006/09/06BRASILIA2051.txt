SUBJECT: BRAZIL BIOFUELS UPDATE - SEPTEMBER 2006 
 
IDB FUND APPROVES GRANT FOR ALTERNATIVE BIOFUEL MARKET 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
¶1.  The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) announced the approval 
of a USD 600,000 grant to Ecologica Institute, a nongovernmental 
organization in Brazil, to create alternative market opportunities 
in rural areas of the state of Tocantins.  The project will 
implement an integrated model for the production and marketing of an 
alternative biofuel produced from sweet potatoes.  Compared to 
sugarcane, sweet potatoes are considered by some scientists as a 
faster and more efficient source of biofuel.  Recent estimates from 
the Brazilian Association for Industrial Machinery and Equipment 
show that approximately USD 1.7 billion will be invested in 
biodiesel infrastructure in the next three years. 
 
SUGAR AND ETHANOL EXPORTS TO TOP MEAT EXPORTS 
--------------------------------------------- 
¶2.  Brazilian sugar and ethanol exports have never been higher and 
will probably exceed meat, one of Brazil's principal commodity 
exports.  The Brazilian Farm Bureau (CNA), estimates that Brazil 
will export approximately USD 7 billion in sugar and ethanol as 
compared to USD 4.87 billion in 2005.  Total sugar/ethanol export 
revenues for the first seven months of this year increased more than 
40% (USD 3.559 billion for 2006) when contrasted to the USD 2.536 
billion revenue for the same period last year. 
 
SUGAR AND ETHANOL REVENUES TOP USD 15 BILLION 
--------------------------------------------- 
¶3.  Sugar and ethanol companies in Brazil will likely end the 
2005/2006 season with net revenues of more than USD 15 billion, a 
10% raise compared to last season.  Data provided by the Sugarcane 
Producers Association of Sao Paulo (Unica) and the Brazilian 
National Supply Company (Conab) show that the country will process 
471.2 million tons of sugar cane producing 17.8 billion liters of 
ethanol.  This represents a more than 5% increase compared to last 
year. 
 
FUTURE BIODIESEL FROM COTTON IN THE STATE OF BAHIA 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
¶4.  U.S. based Crow West Company has plans to produce biodiesel from 
cotton seeds in Western Bahia in order to fuel tractors and other 
machinery that work on the state's expansive cotton and soybean 
farms.  "Demand for biofuels is rising and biodiesel from cotton is 
10% more economical than from soybeans," says Carlos Freitas, 
president of a consulting firm that is preparing the viability study 
for Crow West's plant construction.  The plant will process 76,000 
tons of cotton per year and will receive an estimate USD 17 million. 
 The plant will be ready in August 2007. 
 
PETROBRAS TO EXPORT ETHANOL TO VENEZUELA AND JAPAN 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
¶5.  According to Brazilian daily "O Globo", Brazil's Petrobras and 
Venezuela's oil company PDVSA are working on drafting a long-term 
agreement for Brazil to sell ethanol to Venezuela.  While figures 
revealing initial trade estimates were not disclosed, analysts 
expect the sales will be reflected in Petrobras' export summary as 
early as 2007.  Petrobras has also been talking to Japan, which is 
still analyzing the implementation of a 10% ethanol mix to the 
country's gasoline. 
 
BRAZIL EXPERIMENTING ON HYDROGEN TRANSPORTATION 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
¶6.  Brazil will start testing buses that run on hydrogen and do not 
produce any kind of pollution.  Five buses with hydrogen fuel cells 
will be put into test in 2007 in Sao Paulo, Brazil's biggest and 
most polluted city.  If, after four years, the hydrogen buses 
continue to be viable, the fleet will be expanded to 100 or 200. 
Rio de Janeiro will implement a similar project. 
 
AGENCY THREATENS TO CONTROL ETHANOL EXPORTS 
------------------------------------------- 
¶7. The National Petroleum Agency (ANP), through its executive 
director Haroldo Lima, said that ethanol exports could come under 
government control if there are threats that the domestic market 
could be undersupplied between the end of the current sugar cane 
harvest season and the beginning of the next one.  On the other 
hand, the Ministry of Agriculture issued numbers that could avoid 
such government interference.  Information from the Ministry points 
out a 137% increase in the volume of ethanol exports for August when 
compared to the same month last year and an estimated 17.8 billion 
liters of ethanol exports for 2006.  This last data represents an 
extra billion liter of ethanol for the national demand's supply.
