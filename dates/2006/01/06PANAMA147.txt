Reasons 1.5(b and d)

(C) Just back from attending Evo Morales' presidential
inauguration in Bolivia, First Vice President and Foreign
Minister Samuel Lewis Navarro opined to the Ambassador on
January 23 that Morales had delivered a "fairly moderate"
inaugural address.  Lewis hoped this signaled Morales' desire
to "open a bridge of dialog" to the U.S.  Lewis also said
that during President Torrijos' swing through Chile and
Bolivia, the GOP discussed its free trade prospects in a
series of meetings other counterparts.  He said the GOP sees
the window of opportunity for its bilateral FTA with the U.S.
closing rapidly.  Noting that some within the GOP see a
fading of USG will to close the deal, Lewis wondered aloud if
"perhaps it's time postpone the FTA."  (As reported reftel,
old-guard PRD party members, including some in Torrijos'
cabinet, want to put the FTA on ice - perhaps permanently -
and put the Panama Canal expansion effort to the front of the
GOP's agenda.)  Lewis complained that, absent a strong
political will in Washington to overcome obstacles to the
FTA, the FTA will languish.  Ambassador responded that the
political will exists in Washington to conclude the
agreement, but the remaining issues are substantive, not
political.
