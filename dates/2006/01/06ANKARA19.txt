CONCERNS OVER RUSSIAN NGO LAW 
 
REF: SECSTATE 229260 
 
(SBU)  Turkish Foreign Ministry Russia Department Section 
Chief Meltem Buyukkarakas told us December 28 that the MFA 
does not have an official comment on U.S. efforts with Russia 
regarding Moscow's NGO law.  She added, however, that Turkey 
supports U.S. efforts to encourage democracy in Russia. 
Buyukkarakas mentioned that during the previous week's sixth 
meeting of the Black Sea Working Group in Ankara, Russian 
officials mentioned U.S. and European concerns with the NGO 
law. According to Buyukkarakas, Russian representatives 
stated they view Moscow's NGO law as a necessary component of 
current counterterrorism measures, particularly in fighting 
terrorist finance.  They insisted terrorism is a global 
problem and such measures are necessary to ensure greater 
transparency from organizations operating in Russia.
