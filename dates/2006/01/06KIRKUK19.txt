REF: 05 KIRKUK 284, 289 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION:  Iraqi Turcoman Front (ITF) 
leader Sadettin Ergech called on Regional Coordinator (RC) and 
UK Consul General January 28.  Ergech was the only person 
running as a Turcoman who won a seat in the December national 
legislative elections (some Turcomans running with UIA and other 
lists were also elected).  Ergech and his delegation complained 
that the allocation of compensatory seats was unfair, but they 
did not seem to grasp the formula.  They appealed for US and UK 
help in getting the ITF a second (compensatory) seat in the 
Council of Representatives; this appeal met with no sympathy. 
Encouragingly, the ITF's bottom line was that the elections were 
a step forward for Iraq.  END SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) At the time of the elections, the ITF was very upset 
about alleged Kurdish fraud (reftels).  Ergech and other 
Turcoman leaders claimed their young people, disillusioned with 
them, were on the verge of taking up arms to defend Turcoman 
interests.  In the January 28 meeting, Ergech exhibited 
conflicting sentiments:  he was still unhappy at what he called 
massive fraud by the Kurds and unfair allocation of seats by the 
electoral commission (IECI); he still claimed his followers were 
deeply dissatisfied; at the same time, he was visibly proud of 
having been elected to the Council of Representatives.  His main 
objective for the meeting was to enlist US and UK help to gain a 
compensatory seat for the ITF, in order to reflect more 
accurately the Turcoman share of Iraq's population. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) RC and UK CG stressed that: 
 
-- the international election experts had concluded that there 
was electoral fraud but that it did not substantially affect the 
outcome; 
 
-- there is no evidence that the IECI misapplied the formula for 
allocating compensatory seats.  (RC explained the formula at 
some length, showing that inevitably somebody wins a higher 
percentage of seats than votes, and vice versa.  As long as the 
formula is applied faithfully for all parties, it is not 
unfair.) 
 
¶4.  (SBU) RC quoted one of the IECI's FAQ to the effect that in 
an election, there is no guaranteed representation for 
minorities or anyone else, it all depends on how the voting 
goes. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) As the meeting drew to a close, the ITF delegation 
affirmed that, for all its faults, the December election had 
been a step forward in the establishment of democracy in Iraq. 
They said they would remain engaged in the political process. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) COMMENT:  The ITF leaders seem to have come into the 
meeting without understanding the formula for allocating 
compensatory seats, and without grasping the more general point 
that whenever you draw a line, somebody is going to just barely 
cross it and somebody is going to fall just short - the problem 
is inherent in having a line, it is not a matter of where you 
draw it.  (We have encountered similar incomprehension on the 
part of some surprisingly senior Kurdish figures.) 
 
¶7.  (SBU) COMMENT CONTINUED:  RC was left with the impression 
that Ergech and his colleagues were probing to see if they could 
improve their position in the Council of Representatives, and to 
see how the US and UK assessed the elections.  It is possible 
they actually learned something from the discussion.
