repatriation and reintegration of the Southern Sudanese 
Refugees in Eastern, Central and North Africa.

authority has now been decided to be the Office of the

The Ministry has also conveyed the same to the Office of 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) 
in the Sudan to take note and inform its Headquarters in 
Geneva to act accordingly.
