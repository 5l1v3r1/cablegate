¶1.  (U)  This message confirms earlier e-mail 
correspondence.  Embassy received research clearance for the 
subject vessel (Reftel A) from the MFA under cover of 
diplomatic note number 48/AME dated 12 January 2006.  The 
note states that the French authorities have no objection to 
the research campaign of the ROGER REVELLE in the French 
waters of French Polynesia from 14 January to 11 March, 
¶2006. The note further states that local authorities have 
been informed. 
 
¶2.  (U)  The note further indicates that the French 
authorities do not permit "heavy seismic operations" to be 
conducted during the research program.  The note also 
underscores the necessity for the research vessel, 
throughout its program, to pay specific attention not to 
harm fishing equipment left in place within French waters by 
professional fishermen. 
 
¶3.  (U)  The note also states that the ship must inform 
French authorities of its entrance into and exit from French 
Polynesian waters (mrccpapeete@mail.pf). 
 
¶4.  (U)  Finally, the MFA requests three/three copies of 
both the preliminary and post cruise report.
