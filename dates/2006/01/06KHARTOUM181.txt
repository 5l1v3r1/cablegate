SUBJECT: SUDAN: SRSG PRONK BRIEFS PRESS ON UN REHAT, ABUJA, 
EAST 
 
¶1.  Summary: UN Special Representative (SRSG) for Sudan Jan 
Pronk briefed the press on January 22.  His statement and 
the following Q&A focused mainly on the possibility of a UN 
rehat of the AU force and the Abuja peace talks.  He also 
reported that UNMIS is monitoring the East and said the 
recent SSDF-SPLM agreement of January 8 is positive. End 
summary.

UN Rehat

¶2.  During a January 22 press conference, SRSG Pronk made 
several comments trying to indicate that the UN was not 
pushing a rehatting of the African Union mission in Darfur. 
He said if the AU confirms the decision to pursue that 
course, the UN "might" have to do it.  If the UN Security 
Council takes that decision, the UN Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) 
will need considerable time to prepare, Pronk said, 
necessitating increased resources for the AU to continue 
beyond March 31.  For that reason he went to Washington and 
Brussels to ask for support to the AU.  Pronk said any move 
to rehat is not part of a conspiracy against Sudan, as some 
articles here in Sudan have stated, and reiterated that the 
AU has done a good job.  He added that the protection force 
should be perhaps twice as big.  Asked if Sudan would accept 
a UN rehat, Pronk said only that he had not seen any 
government statements on the issue.  He also refused to take 
a position on the possibility of Sudan chairing the AU.

Darfur Peace Process

¶3.  Pronk said his main concern at the Abuja peace talks is 
Mini Minawi's absence, which tells the two million 
Darfurians in IDP and refugee camps that he is not serious. 
He said he asked Washington and Brussels to pressure the 
movements to seek a political solution.  The government has 
been tough but constructive, he added. 
 
¶4.  Pronk expressed concern that the report of the Panel of 
Experts of the Security Council has stalled in committee. 
Pronk said he had seen the two reports, which address 
individuals who are a hindrance to peace and arms suppliers 
to the parties in conflict, but noted that they need to be 
taken up by the UNSC.

East, South

¶5.  Pronk said that UNMIS is now on the ground in the East 
and has told the Eastern Front that it needs to honor its 
commitment to Libya as a mediator.  He said the situation is 
stable, with agreement that the SPLA will remain in Hamesh 
Koreb for a period.  UNMIS is optimistic that the Eastern 
Front is willing to talk instead of fight.  Regarding the 
South, Pronk said the January 8 agreement between the SSDF 
and SPLM is positive and achieves the difficult step of 
power sharing.
