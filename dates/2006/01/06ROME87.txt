¶1.  Summary.  Responding to alarming media reports on the 
Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (H5N1) outbreaks in 
Turkey, on January 9, USMISSION UN Rome asked Juan Lubroth, 
FAO Senior Veterinary Officer (SVO), to share with us FAO's 
assessment of the situation in Turkey and ongoing work to 
control the situation.  FAO believes there have been 14 
animal outbreaks in 10 provinces, with great potential for 
escalation.  In addition, FAO notes that 27 human patients 
are under investigation for possible exposure.  FAO has 
received Euro 50,000 from the European Commission (EC) to 
support H5N1 control efforts in Turkey.  Two FAO staff 
members, including the SVO, received authorization on 
January 9 from the Government of Turkey (GoT) to travel to 
Turkey today to assist in efforts to assess the situation. 
FAO believes there is potential for escalation in animal 
outbreaks. End Summary 
 
¶2.  According to Lubroth, despite slow reaction by the 
GoT's Ag Ministry to involve FAO, the organization has been 
communicating closely with the World Health Organization 
(WHO), the European Union (EU), the EC and European Centre 
for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) on the H5N1 
outbreaks in Turkey since January 7.  In addition, the 
GoT's Chief Veterinary Officer (CVO) has been in close 
contact with FAO, advocating broad support for any course 
of action required to control the outbreaks in poultry and 
other fowl.  On January 9, the EC contributed Euro 50,000 
to FAO to support H5N1 control efforts in affected 
provinces.  Effective January 10, FAO is sending a two- 
member team, including its SVO, to assess the situation and 
make recommendations on a course of action.  The team will 
remain in Turkey through January, with staff members 
rotating from FAO headquarters in Rome. 
 
¶3.  At present, based on current reporting from Turkey, FAO 
believes there have been 14 animal outbreaks in 10 
provinces, with great potential for escalation.  It is not 
yet known whether this information is new or if this is old 
information recently uncovered.  In addition, Lubroth 
indicated that 27 human patients are under investigation 
for possible exposure.  Lubroth also noted that local 
veterinary authorities are working diligently to control 
the outbreaks, and he has been asked to make high-level 
contacts within the GoT to ensure continued cooperation and 
collaboration. 
 
¶4. Lubroth has expressed a willingness to meet with and 
brief USG personnel in Turkey.  Please contact USMISSION UN 
Rome staff member Harriet Spanos, at SpanosH@state.gov or 
+39-06-4674-3515, to be put into contact with Dr. Lubroth. 
USMISSION UN Rome will continue to cover and widely 
disseminate information on FAO activities to combat and 
control H5N1.
