¶1.  (U) Summary: Reports that Colombian military units 
entered Ecuadorian territory in hot pursuit of FARC 
irregulars on January 28 prompted vociferous GOE protests. 
End Summary. 
 
Reported Facts 
-------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) According to the press, three Black Hawk helicopters 
and two Colombian military planes violated Ecuadorian 
airspace in pursuit of FARC rebels in the border village of 
El Bermejo, Sucumbios province on January 28.  Both sides 
reportedly exchanged gunfire for 11 hours, causing damage to 
local property and forcing local residents to flee the area 
temporarily.  The GOE deployed 300 troops on January 29 to 
investigate the purported incursion. 
 
¶3.  (U) The incursion caused nearly 100 residents of the 
Sucumbios border town of Barranca Bermeja to flee their homes 
for the nearby village of Santa Rosa.  UNHCR reported 
assisting 91 persons ) 35 adults and 56 children.  By late 
Monday afternoon, all families had returned home, a UNHCR 
spokesman said. Although media reports spoke of 70 families 
with 150 children taxing the facilities of tiny Santa Rosa, 
both UNHCR and International Organization for Migration 
recorded the number of displaced persons at fewer than 100, 
most Colombians residing in Ecuador. 
 
GOE Reaction 
------------ 
 
¶4.  (U) Foreign Minister Francisco Carrion issued what he 
described as an &energetic8 protest of the alleged 
incursion on January 30 to Colombian Ambassador Carlos 
Holguin, publicly stating that such actions impede efforts to 
improve bilateral relations.  FM Carrion told the press that 
while Ecuador and Colombia are aligned against 
narco-traffickers, this does not authorize the GOC to enter 
Ecuador at will.  Minister of Defense Oswaldo Jarrin on 
January 30 publicly confirmed the violation of Ecuadorian 
airspace, while Colombian and Ecuadorian military officials 
met in San Miguel, Sucumbios to discuss the issue and 
exchange evidence, per recent bilateral accords. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) MOD Jarrin ordered the Ecuadorian Air Force on 
January 31 to activate the country's air defense system, 
stating that the measure would allow the GOE to detect 
further violations of Ecuadorian airspace.  But with the 
system's limited capability and the Ministry's lack of 
resources, the statement may represent symbolic posturing 
rather than actual military threat. 
 
Bogota Studies Incident 
----------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) PolOff met with Colombian DCM Salvador Escobar on 
January 31 to assess GOC reaction.  Mr. Escobar provided a 
statement made by Colombian VFM Camilo Reyes on January 31, 
in which he said the GOC is awaiting the results of the 
investigation to officially respond to the GOE.  However, VFM 
Reyes noted that the two governments are utilizing mechanisms 
created to deal with such incidents, and that Colombia is 
fundamentally respectful of Ecuadorian sovereignty, 
appreciative of GOE cooperation, and hopeful that the two 
countries would continue efforts to stamp out 
narco-trafficking and illegal armed group activity. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) The GOE,s public posturing on the suspected 
January 28 incursion is clearly defensive in nature, and we 
believe an attempt to quickly quell public nationalistic 
backlash.  It is encouraging to see the newly established 
bilateral mechanism for post-incident consultations work as 
planned at the operational level in the border zone.  We hope 
the tension can be contained quickly, and not setback recent 
positive strides in cross-border relations.
