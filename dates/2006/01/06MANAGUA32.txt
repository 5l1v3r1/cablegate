¶1.  (SBU)  The following comments are submitted in response 
to A EB/IFC/OIA request for additional details to supplement 
previously submitted Reftel C. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Composition of Magnum Company:  Corporacion 
Nucleos Urbanos Magnum, S.A. ("Magnum") ownership is divided 
equally among Barreto's father, mother and six adult 
brothers, according to mother Ligia Chamorro de Barreto and 
son Samuel Barreto.  Brother Juan Diego Barreto is the only 
American citizen.  Magnum created the Serranias housing 
development that was taken over by the Army in 1979. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Abuse of Position:  Ref B) page 13 describes how 
Contreras signed property documents on behalf of the Army. 
In a handwritten note to the Consulate dated November 2, 
2005, Contreras states that his actions were performed in the 
service of the Army and not for individual gain.  He "affirms 
and reaffirms" ("afirmo y reafirmo") that he never occupied, 
rented, possessed, or appropriated any property belonging to 
U.S. citizens.  He adds that (property) claim resolution 
requests are not within his portfolio and should be made 
instead to the appropriate Nicaraguan authorities. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  In conversations with the Property Office on 
December 21, 2005, and January 3, 2006,  Samuel Barreto 
stated that to his knowledge, Contreras' involvement with Lot 
62 was as the representative who signed documents for the 
Army, and that Contreras did not benefit personally. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  Importance of Contreras in the Army:  The January 
1988 Revised Edition of Nicaraguan Biographies:  A Resource 
Book. Special Report No. 174 (State Department Publication) 
characterizes Contreras as the "right-hand man" of Humberto 
Ortega.  Contreras' influence during the takeover of the 
Serranias property would have derived from his relationship 
with Ortega and/or the FSLN's National Directorate's 
Tercerista faction circa 1979.  The group advocated immediate 
violence in the framework of a broad tactical alliance with 
all anti-Somoza sectors of Nicaraguan society.  In other 
words, while downplaying his own importance, Contreras 
appears to have enjoyed significant influence during the 
1980s. 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  Proximity, continued:  While conferring with 
Property Office staff, Samuel Barreto Googled an article 
entitled "Notifax, The News of Nicaragua in Synthesis" for 
Monday June 9, 1997.  The Notifax online compendium at 
notifax@ibw.com.ni (page 2 of 7 pages in both Spanish and 
English versions) sources El Nuevo Herald de Miami as the 
origin.  The March 12, 1990 article describes a six-million 
dollar bank account deposit, with money allegedly divided 
among the following persons:  Humberto Ortega's wife, Ligia 
Trejos; the ex-Ambassador of Costa Rica in Nicaragua, Carlos 
Aguilar; Ortega assistant, Ramiro Contreras; assistant of 
General Joaquin Cuadra, Elizabeth Pinell; Caribbean Fruits 
Investment and an unnamed Honduran money exchange company. 
 
¶7.  (SBU)  On December 21, 2005, Econoff, two Property 
Section lawyers and Samuel Barreto visited the Las Serranias 
development and inspected the properties (from the street), 
including Cuban, Russian and Magnum-controlled lots. 
Although valuable real estate, the houses are not luxurious 
and some have been abandoned.  Maturing trees grow inside 
roofless rooms in one building.  The property is no longer 
secured or fenced by the Army or anyone else.  The complex is 
open to the public, includes a restaurant and has 
appreciation potential.  Magnum has placed "For Sale" signs 
outside the lots it still owns.  A "For Rent" sign is 
promiV:v|V;Lzobiliaria de Ahorro y Prestamo, a privately-owned savings 
and loan.  Nationalized by the Sandinistas, it was converted 
into the Banco de la Vivienda de Nicaragua (BAVINIC), an 
FSLN-controlled housing bank.  Although Magnum eventually 
paid off its outstanding property loans in full in the 1990s, 
the Army still retains 29 properties in the Serranias complex.
