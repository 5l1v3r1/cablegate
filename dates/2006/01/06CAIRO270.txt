¶1.  (U) Summary:  The Cairo Avian Influenza Working Group 
(AIWG) met January 12, 2006, to assess mission preparedness, 
review its tripwires, and evaluate recent interactions with 
the Government of Egypt (GOE) on avian influenza (AI) 
preparedness and other related issues.   End summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) NAMRU-3 confirms that no H5N1 has been detected in 
Egypt, although recent problems with importation of regional 
flu samples (see reftel F) have impaired NAMRU-3's 
surveillance and detection activities. In addition, FAS 
reports that, although a blocked feather meal shipment has 
been let in, the blanket poultry ban remains in place, 
despite the fact that the U.S. has no high-path AI and a 
strong program of surveillance (see reftel C).  The 
Ambassador will meet with the new Minister of Health January 
23 to address these issues. 
 
¶3.  (U) The U.S. continues to provide assistance to Egypt for 
AI detection and response. USAID may provide $1.5 million in 
assistance to the GOE for long-term development.  USAID has 
provided training through APHIS in the U.S. for foreign 
veterinary workers, including four people from the Middle 
East (two of them from Egypt). 
 
¶4.  (SBU) However, there continue to be questions concerning 
the GOE's ability to respond effectively to an AI outbreak. 
To date, no GOE preparedness plan has been published, 
although interministerial meetings on AI have taken place, 
and a draft national preparedness plan was circulated.  Local 
AI reporting has focused on events in other regions. 
However, the GOE has not announced any planning in the event 
of a possible AI outbreak in Egypt.  Al-Ahram newspaper 
reports that the Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP) now 
requires intensive inspection measures at all airports and 
ports of entry for visitors and cargo from Turkey, with 
immediate notification of the MOHP and quarantine of 
suspected cases. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Post conducted a review of tripwires vis--vis the 
Turkey outbreak, and will amplify the plan by creating two 
sets of tripwires to distinguish between avian flu and 
human-to-human contagion.  Although post has communicated a 
great deal of information on AI to the Mission community, a 
warden message will be issued to stress the need for AmCit 
preparedness in the event of an AI outbreak in Egypt.  PA and 
CONS report that there have been no press/AmCit inquiries 
regarding AI.
