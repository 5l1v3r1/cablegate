SUBJECT: NICARAGUA WILL PUSH FOR MEASURED RESPONSE TO U.S. 
IMMIGRATION PROPOSALS 
 
REF: STATE 2995 
 
¶1. (SBU) During a meeting on January 6, Foreign Minister 
Norman Caldera informed the Ambassador that the GON will urge 
participants in the January 9 meeting in Mexico to respond in 
a cautious, measured manner to the U.S. immigration proposals 
passed by the House of Representatives.  After the Ambassador 
delivered the talking points in reftel, Caldera--who prefers 
to keep his distance from the issue--stated that Vice 
Minister Javier Williams will attend the meeting in Mexico 
City.  When queried about the meeting and the proposed wall, 
Caldera noted that he has publicly stated that he is obliged 
to worry about Nicaraguans abroad, including those with TPS 
status in the U.S., and that the GON will take no action to 
endanger that status. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Caldera believes that a public statement at the 
Mexico City meeting is inevitable, but he assured us that 
Williams will seek to limit it to an "expression of concern" 
and a "call for further study."  Williams will also use the 
meeting to press the Mexicans on their poor treatment of 
Central Americans passing through their country.  Caldera 
understands our position, is sympathetic, and knows how 
counterproductive a vocal protest could turn out to be. 
However, he also hopes for an additional TPS extension, and 
is clearly looking for a quid pro quo on the issue.
