¶1. (SBU) Summary: On 31 January 2006, the DCM convened a full 
Emergency Action Committee (EAC) to discuss Embassy Kuwait's 
contingency planning for Avian Influenza (AI) due to reports 
by the World Health Organization (WHO) of animal to human 
transmission of the H5N1 virus in Iraq.  This transmission 
meets Tripwire 2 in Embassy Kuwait's emergency preparedness 
planning for AI.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The DCM convened a full EAC with representatives 
from the following offices: RSO, MGT, ECON, MED, CUSTOMS, 
POL, POLMIL, CONS, DAO, PA, CICA, GSO, FCS, IRM, MSG, HR, and 
IBB.  The DCM reviewed the cases reported in Iraq by the WHO 
of preliminary confirmation of H5N1 AI virus in the death on 
17 January 2006 of a 15-year old female, and the 
investigation into the death of her uncle on 27 January 2006. 
 The DCM noted these cases would meet the criteria for 
Tripwire 2 which was defined as "Any case of AI among humans 
in Kuwait or Gulf region (animal to human transmission.)" 
 
¶3. (SBU) The EAC agreed to proceed with actions suggested in 
the AI preparedness plan under tripwires #1 and #2 including: 
 
¶A. (SBU) Issuance of a management notice including 
information on health care, ways to prevent disease 
transmission, emergency preparedness, and a reference guide 
for finding additional information.  The notice will include 
information publicly available from WHO, the Centers for 
Disease Control (CDC), and the PandemicFlu.gov website.  The 
information will also be provided on the embassy intranet for 
easy access, and a quick reference guide will be created so 
employees can have a consolidated source of locally 
applicable phone numbers and points of contact. 
 
¶B. (SBU) The embassy Health Unit will provide briefings for 
employees, family members, and household staff.  These 
briefings will include information on topics such as food 
handling, disease transmission, hand washing, and home health 
care. 
 
¶C. (SBU) CONS will draft a warden message to repeat the 
previously issued information as well as update the American 
community on available resources including WHO, CDC, and 
PandemicFlu.gov. 
 
¶4. (SBU) ECON briefed the EAC on ongoing contacts with the 
Government of Kuwait (GOK) on the GOK response to AI 
including agricultural issues and plans for decontamination 
of vehicles entering Kuwait from Iraq.  ECON will report 
status of host government actions via septel. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Post's Avian Influenza Working Group (AIWG) will 
continue meeting to ensure Tripwires are current and modify 
recommendations as necessary. 
 
¶6. (SBU)  There has been no new security information or 
change to the assessment of threats against U.S. personnel or 
facilities in Kuwait so the EAC concluded the session.
