SUBJECT: WHO EXECUTIVE BOARD:  DEMARCHE REQUEST ON SMALLPOX 
AGENDA ITEM 
 
REF: SECSTATE 232766 
 
ESTH Counselor made the demarche requested in reftel to 
senior health and foreign affair officials in the Canadian 
Government, including Senior Asst. Deputy Minister of Health, 
Ian Shugart, Director General for International Affairs at 
Health Canada, Carla Gilders, and Senior Policy Advisor for 
International Health Affairs at Foreign Affairs Canada, Don 
MacPhee.  Gilders told us that the GOC was sympathetic to our 
concerns.  The GOC would like to see the eventual destruction 
of smallpox virus stocks in the U.S. and Russia, but 
understands the need for continued research for the 
development of antiviral drugs and vaccines.  Her comments 
were echoed by Don MacPhee, who represented Canada in Geneva 
on WHO issues prior to his reassignment to Ottawa.  Both said 
that there would be a Canadian delegation meeting in Ottawa 
next week to prepare for the upcoming WHO Executive Board 
meeting and noted that the U.S. demarche would be discussed 
at that time.  Post will report any additional information we 
may be able to get on the GOC's position prior to the 
Executive Board meeting later this month.
