¶1.  Econoff met Jan. 10 with Mohammed El Kadiri, Technical 
Director for Moroccan national telecoms regulator ANRT to 
discuss Moroccan spectrum management policy per request in 
Ref A.  Answers below are keyed to questions in Reftel. 
 
¶2. A) The authority responsible for spectrum management in 
Morocco is the Agence Nationale de Reglementation des 
Telecommunications (ANRT), the Moroccan national telecoms 
regulator.  ANRT is an independent regulatory agency that 
reports directly to the Prime Minister's office. 
 
B)  Spectrum is assigned in two ways: it is provided to 
private sector operators through a competitive licensing 
regime; and to state institutions like the National Police 
based on good-faith technical discussions of the entity's 
needs and on a first-come, first-served basis. 
 
C)  ANRT describes its licensing regime as a "beauty contest" 
competition in which the regulator weighs offers based on 
criteria including coverage, technical specifications and 
price.  Licenses are awarded on a technology-neutral basis 
and are subject to renewal based on competitive contest. 
 
D)  Licensees do not have the flexibility to transfer their 
spectrum rights at this time, nor is there a secondary market 
for spectrum rights in Morocco.  Licensees may not aggregate 
licenses nor subdivide them.  They may not accept payment in 
exchange for spectrum access. 
 
E)  There are annual frequency fees imposed on spectrum users 
beyond the original licensing fees.  Fees are set by the 
Ministry of Industry and Telecommunications.  State users 
(National Police, e.g.) and diplomatic entities are entirely 
exempt from, or enjoy reduced frequency fees. 
 
F)  Government and other non-commercial users are subject to 
different rules as described above (different allocation 
process, different fee structure). 
 
G)  No other incentives beyond market-based competition are 
used at this time to encourage efficient use of spectrum. 
 
H)  As addressed above, Government and other non-profit 
agencies are subject to different rules regarding allocation 
and fees. 
 
I)  Primary in-country contact on spectrum management policy:
