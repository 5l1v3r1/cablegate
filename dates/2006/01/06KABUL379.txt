SUBJECT: JAPANESE RESTART ROAD CONSTRUCTION ON KANDAHAR- 
HERAT PORTION OF THE RING ROAD 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Kenji Saito, 3rd ranking officer at the 
Japanese Embassy, confirmed today that work restarted 
earlier this week on the Japanese portion of the Ring 
Road between Kandahar to Herat.  This approximately 116 
km portion stretches from Kandahar to the beginning of 
the Saudi-funded section in Helmand Province. 
According to Saito, this section should be complete by 
the end of calendar year 2006.  Work had been halted 
since March 2005 for security concerns.  Saito said the 
Japanese Ambassador plans to travel to the site after 
he returns from the London Conference. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Japanese Ambassador and staff met with 
Governor of Kandahar on January 25 at a dinner attended 
by the Charge.  The Japanese grilled the governor on 
security and were assured that local authorities would 
do all they could to avert attacks.  The governor noted 
that in addition to beefing up Afghan security forces, 
intensified cooperation with Pakistan was needed to 
improve control of the border region and prevent 
infiltration of terrorists from Pakistani territory. 
The governor noted that suicide attacks occurred in 
Europe, too, and in the end there was only so much he 
could do to prevent them, but he committed to doing all 
he could. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Japan International Cooperation System (JICS) 
staff members met with CJTF76 officials based near 
Kandahar and requested medical support for Japanese 
nationals supervising the Kandahar-Herat road 
construction project.  CJTF76 explained that medical 
resources in the region had a primary mission for 
Combined Forces personnel; however, if the capability 
and capacity were available at the time of the injury, 
CJTF76 would treat severe injuries (life, limb, and 
eyesight) only.  Minor injuries should be treated at 
the local Kandahar Hospital.  Japanese Embassy 
officials in Kabul are going through both civilian and 
military channels to negotiate a written agreement for 
in extremis medical treatment for JICS staff in 
Kandahar.
