¶7.   Security Assessment:  In the aftermath of Operation 
Iraqi Freedom (OIF) there continues to be the potential 
for both transnational and indigenous terrorist groups to 
target U.S. interests in Turkey.  After the Gulf War, the 
predecessor to the Turkish Terrorist Group Revolutionary 
People's Liberation Party/Front (DHKP/C) assassinated 
four Americans in Turkey and carried out numerous 
bombings of U.S. targets (mostly private sector 
businesses, although two rockets were directed toward the 
Consulate General in Istanbul).  Subsequent to the ending 
of OIF hostilities, there have been isolated terrorist 
bombings attributed to DHKP/C and other indigenous 
terrorist groups in protest of OIF.  Other Turkish 
terrorist groups with anti-Western sympathies include 
Marxist-Leninist Communist Party (MLKP) Turkish Communist 
Party/Marxist Leninist (TKP/ML), Turkish Workers and 
Peasants Revolutionary Army (TIKKO) and Islamic Greater 
Eastern Raiders/Front (IBDA/C).! 
 
Al-Qa'ida threats to target U.S. facilities in Turkey 
have been public knowledge for some time.  On November 
15, 2003, two synagogues in Istanbul were the targets of 
suicide car bombs.  On November 20, the British Consulate 
General and the London-based HSBC bank in Istanbul were 
damaged by powerful explosions, killing dozens and 
wounding hundreds.  These incidents represent a 
significant change from prior attacks in Turkey, which 
have previously involved small-scale, random bombings and 
small numbers of casualties.  The investigations of these 
incidents in Istanbul remain open but transnational 
terrorist links are suspected.  The potential for 
violence and terrorist actions against U.S. citizens and 
interests continues. 
 
The Turkish National Police (TNP) is quite responsive in 
their role as protector of U.S. diplomatic and military 
interests in Turkey.  The TNP has provided enhanced 
coverage at each of our facilities in Ankara, Istanbul, 
Adana and Izmir.  The incidence of crime, both violent 
and the more traditional tourist crimes (pick pocketing, 
purse-snatching, etc.), is relatively low throughout 
Turkey.  Visitors to Istanbul should be aware that 
tourist-type crimes are more prevalent there, especially 
in the traditionalist tourist areas, such as Sultanahmet 
and Istiklal Caddesi.  The security office encourages 
visitors to report any security incidents, including 
surveillance, to the RSO immediately. Useful security
