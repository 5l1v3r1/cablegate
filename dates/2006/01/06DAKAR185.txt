¶1.  On January 24, the prosecution dropped for lack of 
evidence "the threat to national security and defense" 
charges against former Prime Minister Idrissa Seck (Ref A) 
and his co-defendants: Hassan Fares, Mbaye Coulibaly, 
Sandrine Fares, Sandrine Madec, El Hadji Ndary Gueye and 
Coumba Ngouye Thiam.  The remaining embezzlement charges 
relate to the Thies Public Works Case.  The prosecution 
has also accused Seck and one of his attorneys of 
"irregular release of correspondence."  The senior 
investigative judge may still send these charges to be 
heard by the courts. 
 
¶2.  On January 19, the Constitutional Court declared 
itself incompetent to rule on the validity of the law 
extending the term of National Assembly Deputies beyond 
June 2006, thereby coupling the presidential and 
legislative elections.  With the Constitutional Court's 
ruling, both elections are now on track for February 2007.
