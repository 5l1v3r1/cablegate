On January 10 reftel points were delivered to French MFA 
Afghanistan desk officer, Cyril Gerardon, who said that the 
French had discussed and submitted a proposal to the French 
Cabinet on January 5 whereby the French would donate ten 
million euros to a trust fund.  He stressed that the cabinet 
had yet to approve this contribution, but that the MFA felt 
relatively confident that it would be approved, thus 
providing greater funding than originally anticipated.  He 
added that the lead French representative at the meeting 
would probably be Herve Ladsous, the Director for Asia at the 
MFA.  The talking points were shared with the office of the 
Ambassador to Afghanistan in Paris and with the British 
Embassy.
