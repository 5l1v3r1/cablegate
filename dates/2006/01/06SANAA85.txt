¶1.  On January 18, Econoffs delivered reftel demarche to 
Deputy Minister of Trade (MOT), Iqbal Bahadar.  Bahadar said 
he was aware of the February 13-14 OECD ministerial meeting 
in Jordan, but was not yet sure if the Minister of Trade 
would lead Yemen's delegation.  An Arab League meeting on 
economic policy is scheduled to take place on the same dates, 
explained Bahadar, and he was not sure which one the Minister 
would attend.  Econoffs requested that MOT clarify the 
composition of the Yemeni delegation and provide that 
information to post. 
 
¶2.  The meeting came on the heels of a visit to Sanaa by Mr. 
Reiner Geiger, Head of the OECD MENA program, from December 
26 to January 3.  During his visit, Mr. Geiger met with 
representatives of MOT, the Ministry of Planning, and the 
General Investment Authority.  Geiger has since been working 
with the ROYG to develop an investment strategy to be 
presented at the ministerial.  Post will continue to monitor 
progress on the plan, and determine who has ownership of the 
process.  The ROYG has no plans at this time to make a 
financial contribution to the MENA program.
