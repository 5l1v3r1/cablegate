SUBJECT: ZIMBABWEQS AMBASSADORQS SPECIAL SELF-HELP PROGRAM 
FINAL REPORT FOR FY2005 AND FUNDING REQUEST FOR FY 2006 
 
REF: STATE 1255 
 
¶1. (U) Post does not anticipate returning any of its USD 
100,000 FY 2005 Self-Help Allowance for re-allocation. 
Funds were obligated on September 30, 2005 as outlined in 
paragraph 3 below. 
 
¶2. (U) For FY 2006, post requests an increase in Self-Help 
funding from USD 100,000 to USD 120,000 for two reasons. 
First, the deteriorating economic situation here has led to 
more frequent and greater disruptions (deliveries disrupted 
by fuel shortages, hyperinflation-associated complications, 
etc.) to overall project administration, adding to per 
project costs.  Second, the profile of humanitarian 
assistance in our bilateral agenda here has grown with 
Zimbabwe's deepening humanitarian crises and the 
deterioration in bilateral relations.  Accordingly, the 
alleviation of suffering and positive publicity generated 
by Self-Help projects is increasingly important to 
achieving our MPP goals. 
 
¶3. (U) Post funded 13 projects in FY 2005: 5 income 
generation projects, 5 water projects, and 3 supply 
requests for a training facility, medical clinic, and 
compost toilet producer. 
 
Project NumberQProject Name 
Amount Funded 
Description 
 
IAA-5-613-01QYouth Coalition Center 
Allocation: QUSD 6,000.00 
The Project trains youths in income-generating projects and 
assists orphans with school fees and purchases of 
uniforms.  A qualified brick molder currently trains the 
youths using two hand molders.  However, the hand molders 
produce only 500 substandard bricks for sale per day 
despite a more than fourfold greater demand.  The center is 
in a position to provide building materials for community 
members impacted by Operation Restore Order.  SSH funds 
will provide an electric brick-molding machine, which can 
produce more than 1250 bricks per day while improving the 
quality of production. 
 
IAA-5-613-02QNew Error WomenQs Sewing Project 
Allocation: QUSD 3,000.00 
In 2003, a group of HIV-affected women formed this sewing 
co-operative aimed at training disadvantaged and 
HIV-positive women and girls in making school uniforms for 
local schools.  SSH funds will provide new sewing machines, 
an embroidering machine, and spare parts to produce more 
and better quality uniforms to generate income and meet 
local demand. 
 
IAA-5-613-03QKufunda Learning Village 
Allocation:QUSD 1,000.00 
The project is designed to assist poor rural communities to 
build easy cheap compost toilets as an alternative to both 
the domestically popular "Blair" toilet, which many cannot 
afford, and the bush.  The toilets provide rich humus for 
planting fruit trees and growing vegetables in gardens and 
fields.  Members of this organization are working with 5 
local communities and have already supplied 100 compost 
toilets to each community.  SSH funds will provide 
materials for 65 compost toilet starter kits. 
 
IAA-5-613-04QKapiri Grinding Mill 
Allocation:QUSD 7,000.00 
 
HARARE 00000093  002 OF 003 
 
 
SSH fund will provide an income-generating grinding mill 
and materials for housing the mill in the local community. 
The local School Development Committee will provide 25 
percent of the total cost of the project. 
 
IAA-5-613-05QMukaro Community Gardening Project 
Allocation:QUSD 6,000.00 
With the help of the Rural Unity for Development 
Organization (RUDO), the 259-member community has worked in 
39 villages in three wards to provide more than 900 orphans 
with access to community gardens through the purchase of 
materials and training in organic farming methods. 
Proceeds from the sale of vegetables have contributed to 
the purchase of clothes and food, and to school fees for 
these orphans.  SSH funds will provide fencing, start-up 
materials, and toilets for the completion of an 
eight-hectare herbal plantation. 
 
IAA-5-613-06   Bonda Art & Craft 
Allocation:QUSD 8,000.00 
This 30-woman co-operative, established in 1993, produces 
batik products using local materials such as cotton and 
sadza (the local corn-based food staple).  SSH funds will 
provide new drying racks, a tin roof, and other materials 
to expand production.  The funds will also be used to 
assist this group in marketing its products 
internationally. 
 
IAA-5-613-07   Dzidzai Foundation Trust 
Allocation:QUSD 9,000.00 
This registered community organization offers training in 
sewing, knitting, and catering skills to women and youths 
who are unable to pursue further academic education. 
Formed in the early 1980s by 13 women, the organization 
built a training center with financial assistance from 
Norwegian People's Aid.  Since 1998, more than 150 
graduates of the center have received training in knitting 
and clothing design.  SSH funds will provide three new 
electric sewing machines and spare parts for machines in 
disrepair. 
 
IAA-5-613-08   Dumbambwe Sangano WomenQs Training Center 
Allocation:QUSD 9,000.00 
This training center was established in 2004 to develop 
income-generating skills for local women in activities such 
as growing vegetables and herbs, candle making, 
bee-keeping, and peanut butter making.  The current water 
supply at the training center is increasingly contaminated 
due to the exposure of the well to grazing animals.  SSH 
fund will complete a borehole to ensure access to safe 
water. 
 
IAA-5-613-09   Lupote Sustainable Agriculture Project 
Allocation:QUSD 17,000 
Through a partnership with Painted Dog Conservancy, the 
Lupote Primary School established a vegetable garden in 
2004 as an alternative source of income for a community 
largely dependent on game poaching.  Although the site 
lacks dependable access to water, the garden has served as 
a training ground for the local community in small-garden 
techniques as well as sustainable agricultural practices. 
SSH fund will provide a borehole to increase 
income-generating activities, promote environmentally 
sustainable agriculture production, and provide potable 
water to the primary school. 
 
IAA-5-613-10   Mukauzaneni Horticulture Project 
Allocation:QUSD 11,500 
 
HARARE 00000093  003 OF 003 
 
 
10 women at the local primary school run this small 
community garden.  Originally funded by SSH in 2002, this 
project was not completed due to technical obstacles and 
performance problems with the original contractor.  FY05 
funds are needed to provide a hand-operated mono pump and 
additional piping to complete the project.  The SSH office 
plans to employ a hydrogeological consultant to ensure 
successful completion of  the project. 
 
IAA-5-613-11QUkuthuthuka Water Project 
Allocation:QUSD 12,000.00 
This community-based crhche currently draws water from a 
river 7 km away.  FY02 SSH funds were provided to install a 
borehole, piping, and water tank.  However, problems in 
locating water led to significant cost overruns.  The 
current borehole site is not properly encased resulting in 
contaminated water.  FY05 funds will complete the project 
under the original contract terms with the collaboration of 
an SSH-funded hydrogeological consultant. 
 
IAA-5-613-12QYoung Generation Pre-School and Nursery 
Allocation: QUSD 5,000.00 
This pre-school and nursery, operated by three teachers, 
caters to 120 children in the Hatcliffe extension community 
despite the lack of any structure, toilets, or furniture. 
Grant funds will provide a temporary structure, toilet, and 
furniture for the crhche, allowing children in the 
community to learn under a roof for the first time.  Any 
additional resources would be used for the purchase of 
school supplies. 
 
IAA-5-613-13QGokwe Jombo Horticulture Project 
Allocation:QUSD 11,500.00 
This project was initially funded in 2002 to assist a 
community of eighty families with a borehole for clean 
drinking water and irrigation to a 2-hectare plot.  The 
grant of USD 13,000 was used to pay for a borehole, diesel 
pump, security fence, and garden tools.  The community 
provided the labor for the project.  The project did not 
achieve its goals because of a decrease in the water table 
and problems with the borehole contractor.  FY05 SSH funds 
will provide additional piping, a diesel pump, and outlet 
taps to complete the work.  The SSH office will employ a 
hydrogeological consultant to ensure the work is completed 
to satisfaction.
