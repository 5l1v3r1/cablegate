(A) SUBJECTS COVERED IN TODAY'S REPORT: 
 
Iraq 
Greater Middle East 
 
(B) SUMMARY OF COVERAGE: 
 
Electronic media and several dailies lead this morning with 
the record sales of Airbus and Boeing in 2005. For left-of- 
center Le Monde this proves that passengers are flying again - 
especially to Asia and the Near East, and that "September 11 
is behind us."  Left-of-center Liberation asks: What would 
French foreign trade do without Airbus?" and answers: "Not 
much." 
 
Both left-of-center Le Monde and right-of-center Le Figaro 
headlines with stories on Cote d'Ivoire and the violent 
demonstrations that are once again disrupting the peace in 
Abidjan. 
 
In U.S.-related news, the execution of Clarence Allen is 
widely reported, drawing some commentary in the regional 
press. "Bush and Schwarzenegger's America has once again given 
us an illustration of its schizophrenia, of its outrageous 
impertinence in giving lessons in democracy to the rest of the 
world. `Do as I say and not as I do' seems to be the new motto 
of this America that is steeped in religious righteousness, 
deaf to the rest of the world but also to those who, 
increasingly numerous in the U.S., call for a return to real 
democratic and authentically moral principles." (Jacques Guyon 
in La Charente Libre) 
 
According to Le Monde, European sources say that Moscow may 
not vote for the transfer of the issue of Iran's nuclear 
program to the UNSC but will likely abstain: "This would mark 
a victory for the IAEA's strategy which aims to preserve the 
unity of the international community." 
 
Le Monde's U.S. correspondent reports the decrease in the 
number of American soldiers wounded in Iraq in the last year.

In Le Monde, Daniel Vernet criticizes the "New Zealots of 
Democracy." (See Part C) 
 
(C) SUPPORTING TEXT/BLOCK QUOTES: 
 
Iraq 
 
"Decrease in the Number of Soldiers Wounded" 
Left-of-center Le Monde's New York correspondent Eric Leser 
writes (01/18): "The number of wounded American soldiers in 
Iraq has decreased by 26%. This could be due to the fact that 
the attacks are fewer but deadlier. But for the Pentagon it is 
because the Iraqi forces are better trained. Military experts 
however are not convinced and are once again wondering if the 
Pentagon is not confusing what it dreams of and reality. If 
there is no doubt that the Iraqi forces today are greater in 
number and better trained, their loyalty and willingness to 
fight are still in question." 
 
Greater Middle East 
 
"The New Zealots of Democracy" 
Daniel Vernet in left-of-center Le Monde writes: "Since the 
dominating power (the U.S.) imposed its model for democratic 
change, the wisest thing to do is to abide by it. Especially 
when the power in question is perfectly happy with purely 
superficial change. Hosni Moubarak's Egypt is but one example. 
Most Europeans mocked George W. Bush's project for the Greater 
Middle East following the Iraqi adventure and they were not 
completely wrong to do so. The American Administration has 
done all it can to promote the spread of democracy in the 
world it has not, however, been able to rise above the 
obstacles that face the process of democratization."
