Classified By: Ambassador Craig Kelly for reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
¶1.  (C) Summary: Chilean Foreign Minister Ignacio Walker 
reiterated the GOC's concerns about threats against MINUSTAH 
in Haiti during his January 11 meeting with the Ambassador. 
He asked the U.S. to deny visas to the Haitians who were 
behind those threats.  Walker also provided the Ambassador a 
matchbook tour of Chile's regional concerns and expressed 
hope that "with creativity, imagination and good will," the 
U.S. and Chile could avoid a run-in over Chile's impending 
accession to the International Criminal Court.  End Summary. 
 
Haiti 
----- 
 
¶2.  (C) Prior to an exchange of views on United Nations 
reform (ref A), Foreign Minister Walker said the January 9 
Haiti Core Group teleconference was a positive experience, 
and marveled at how quickly Core Group members reached 
agreement with the six principals on-line.  Walker did not 
see any remaining technical obstacles to Haiti's elections 
going forward February 7.  Walker said MINUSTAH had generally 
done a good job at filling in the deficiencies of Haiti's 
electoral commission.  He mentioned some glitches, noting 
that MINUSTAH had in some cases failed to assess polling 
stations for adequate capacity before certifying them. 
Walker noted that Chile currently had a limited number of 
election observers on the ground in Haiti. 
 
¶3.  (C) Reiterating a point made earlier by MFA DG for 
External Relations Carlos Portales (ref A), Walker said SRSYG 
Juan Valdez was "concerned" by calls by some influential 
Haitians to postpone elections, and threats against MINUSTAH 
and himself.  Walker said a small group of Haitian 
businessmen with strong ties to the U.S. were behind these 
moves.  He said the U.S. should threaten to withdraw their 
visas if they continued undermining the democratic process in 
Haiti. 
 
Continental Drift 
----------------- 
 
¶4.  (C) Walker expressed concern about regional developments, 
noting that Evo Morales would be sworn into office on January 
¶22.  Walker said he hoped that Bolivia's need for investment 
and Morales' recent trip to Europe would help move him toward 
the center.  The Ambassador noted the U.S. stands ready to 
work with Morales, but it would be important to limit his 
rhetorical excesses.  Walker lamented that Brazilian 
President Lula's internal difficulties with corruption 
scandals are limiting his influence in the region, allowing 
 
Hugo Chavez to strengthen his hand.  Walker also noted that 
Chavez and Kirchner had effectively acted as allies at the 
Summit of the Americas in Mar del Plata, blocking progress on 
the FTAA, although it was not clear that was more than an 
alliance of convenience.  "Kirchner may end up being the 
region's super-moderate," he observed. 
 
¶5.  (C) Walker said Chile was also concerned with 
developments in Peru.  Chile's overtures to Peru for greater 
commercial integration had not been successful.  "While there 
are reasonable people in Peru, they don't pull together, 
which undermines the country's stability," he said. 
 
International Criminal Court and Article 98 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (C) Walker noted he had been briefed on the Ambassador's 
January 10 meeting with MFA Director General Carlos Portales, 
where they had exchanged views on concluding an Article 98 
agreement.  He said every day he was more convinced of the 
importance of finding a solution to the ICC/Article 98 issue, 
more so because of regional instability.  Walker reiterated 
there was an aversion in Chile to the concept of signing an 
Article 98 agreement.  Politically, it was nearly impossible 
to discuss the concept.  However, he expressed optimism that 
the U.S. and Chile could find a way to resolve the issue 
before the end of the Lagos administration's term in March 
(ref C).  Walker observed a planned video teleconference 
between U.S. and Chilean officials on January 18 would be an 
important step.  He noted the GOC would come to the meeting 
with specific ideas for moving forward.  (Post Note: The 
Embassy will be the site for this DVC meeting.  End Note.)

¶7.  (C) Walker noted that he would be traveling to Asia for 
ten days starting from January 15.  When he returned, he 
would have less than a month and a half left in office.
