SUBJECT: LESOTHO'S POSITION:  REHATTING AMIS REQUEST WITH THE AU 
 
REF: STATE 1351 
 
¶1.  (U) Ambassador engaged GOL Minister of Foreign Affairs 
January 6 on issue of rehatting the African Union Mission in 
Sudan (AMIS).  We acknowledged the positive role AMIS has played 
and emphasized the importance of raising its rehatting during 
the January 12 meeting of the Peace and Security Council. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Minister Moleleki agreed that strengthening the AU's 
role would be important in stabilizing the situation in Sudan. 
In addition to viewing a UN operation as potentially more 
effective, the Minister supported the proposal to have NATO 
personnel assigned. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) We raised our interest in seeking an African commander 
for the force and also drew attention to the fact that planning 
now for rehatting was important given the time it would take to 
operationalize the plan.  Moleleki understood that point and 
instructed his acting Principal Secretary to contact Lesotho's 
AU envoy resident in Addis to bring the issue forward during the 
PSC session.
