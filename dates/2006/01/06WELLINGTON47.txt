SUBJECT:  KUDOS FOR TSS TEAM TO WELLINGTON 
 
¶1. (SBU)  From October to December of 2005, a TSS team from 
OBO was deployed to the American Embassy in Wellington, New 
Zealand. Team members were Danny Brady, Jeff Smith and Ken 
Foree.  The team came to post to install the security wiring 
for a new Marine Security Guard booth. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  This team did an unusually thorough job with their 
wiring work.  They moved all of the control wiring from a 
temporary control booth to the new Post One area while 
maintaining effective control over the security doors of a 
working Embassy.  They expanded and cleaned up alarm wiring 
in several areas.  They rewired the post's two Delta 
Barriers to provide Marine override functions in a single 
day, with their wiring activities invisible to most Embassy 
employees.  The team moved the wiring for over a dozen 
control doors, thirty television cameras, many alarm 
systems, a radio base station and intercom systems into the 
new Marine booth, then tested and documented their work. 
Finally, the team took the time to remove old wiring that 
was no longer needed from the security interface cabinets, 
and labeled the remaining wiring clearly to facilitate 
future troubleshooting.  The resulting wiring cabinets could 
well be used as examples in a training film for other teams. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  During their stay at post, the team members worked 
well together, regulated their working hours effectively and 
maintained cordial relations with the many Embassy employees 
who traversed their wiring bundles.  They stayed in close 
touch with the local contractor, the Facilities Manager, the 
American security escort and the RSO's office as to what 
they were doing.  On leaving the Embassy, they left behind 
clean equipment rooms that were free of debris, freshly 
swept and neatly labeled.  Post wishes to commend the 
installation team, their employer and the office that sent 
them to Wellington for a fine job.
