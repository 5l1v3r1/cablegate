SUBJECT: EMBASSY DUBLIN AVIAN INFLUENZA CONTINGENCY PLANNING AND 
TRIPWIRES 
 
REF: A. STATE 219189 B. DUBLIN 1434 
 
¶1. American Embassy Dublin has the advantage of being located in 
an administratively and technically advanced host nation. The 
Irish Government has actively participated in the US-led global 
planning efforts for Avian Influenza (AI) and has developed an AI- 
specific contingency plan that tracks with USG recommendations. 
Embassy officials have met regularly with Irish Government Health 
Officials to discuss Ireland's preparedness for an Avian 
Influenza outbreak.  While Irish contingency plans are 
comprehensive, Post has concerns about the health system's 
ability to respond to an epidemic as discussed in ref B. 
paragraph 9B. Irish public health services are currently 
stockpiling antiviral agents.  Further information on Irish 
Health Department preparations can be found at 
http://www.ndsc.ie/AZ/Respiratory/AvianInflue nza/Guidance/File,12 
03,en.pdf. 
The expectation is that Mission staff will be able to shelter in 
place indefinitely, unless total societal disorder ensues. 
 
¶2. Post AI tripwires were reviewed and finalized by the Emergency 
Action Committee on January 11, 2006.  American citizen employees 
holding TS security clearances who will be responsible for 
inputting tripwire data are: Raymond D. Toma, CONS and Marie 
Cusack, Management OMS.  Post anticipates that tripwire 
information will be entered into TRIPS by 1/17/06. 
 
¶3. Post preparedness steps (Ref A. para 8) were discussed and 
appropriate action is being taken. 
 
¶4.  Post EAC agreed that if AI becomes pandemic and if there are 
issues concerning Americans seeking assistance that become 
irate/violent or attack Embassy personnel/property, the Embassy's 
Internal Defense and Intruder Plans will be followed.
