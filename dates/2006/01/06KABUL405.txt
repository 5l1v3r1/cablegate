SUBJECT: PRT/HELMAND  HELMAND RELIGIOUS SCHOOL 
GROUNDBREAKING DRAWS HUGE CROWD 
 
1.(SBU)  SUMMARY: The January 23 groundbreaking for a 
PRT-supported madrassa (religious school) drew a huge and 
d 
enthusiastic crowd of over 600.  Local radio, television, 
and print media covered the event.  Most provincial 
directors as well as the Provincial Council (including 
three of four women members) attended the groundbreaking. 
Officials described the project as the most significant PRT 
project ever, dispelling ACM propaganda that the Coalition 
was trying to denigrate Islam.  When complete, the school 
will have a capacity of 400 (200 boarding).  It is 
administratively under the provincial education office and 
will teach secular assignments in addition to its focus on 
Islam.  The school will provide an alternative to students 
attending extremist madrassas in Pakistan.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.(SBU)RESPECTING ISLAM, BRINGING PROGRESSIVE CHANGE: 
Governor Daoud, in his first major public appearance, told 
the large crowd that education is light.  The project 
proves that the Coalition respects Islam.  Daoud said that 
the project will demonstrate that young people do not need 
eed 
to go to extremist madrassas in Pakistan.  The new madrassa 
will not only provide an Islamic education, but students 
will receive a well-rounded education to include English, 
math and science.  The Governor also used the occasion to 
denounce opium cultivation, noting how it goes against the 
principles of Islam. 
 
3.(SBU)Mullah Ahmad, head of the Provincial Mullahs 
Council, said that he strongly supported the inclusion of 
secular subjects in the madrassas curriculum.  He said 
that English is especially important in todays world.  He 
added that the Mullahs Council greatly appreciated the 
PRTs assistance. 
 
4.(SBU)The PRT Commander said that this project 
illustrated that the provincial government was engaged in 
projects that were bringing progressive change to Helmand. 
He urged the audience to support the Government, which 
would lead to more progress in Helmand. 
 
5.(SBU)Separately, Provincial Council Deputy Chairman 
Haji Qurban Ali Urozgani told PRT POLOFF that the madrassa 
 madrassa 
project is the single most important project the PRT has 
undertaken.  Urozgani said that many citizens told him 
that the construction of the school has mitigated their 
fears concerning the Coalitions attitude towards Islam. 
In addition, people are very happy that their sons do not 
have to go to Pakistan for a religious education. 
 
6.(SBU)COMMENT: While the project will raise the 
general education level in Helmand, it is hard to 
overestimate the goodwill that it has brought to the PRT 
and Coalition, especially in disproving ACM propaganda that 
the Coalition is trying to undermine Islam.  The project 
also is likely to have a positive impact on Helmands 
security.  One source of ACM activity in the southern 
region has been the radical madrassas in Pakistan.  It is 
hoped that the Lashkar Gah madrassa will serve as a 
moderating influence, thus mitigating risk in the region. 
END COMMENT.
