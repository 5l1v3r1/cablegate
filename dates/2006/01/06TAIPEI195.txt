SUBJECT:  PRC NATIONALS CAUGHT IN BOARDING CARD SWAP 
 
¶1. Four Chinese (PRC) nationals were intercepted at Narita 
International Airport on Dec. 25, 2005 trying to board 
flight UA890 to Los Angeles using U.S. passports with 
counterfeit biographic pages and swapped boarding passes. 
The Chinese were from Fujian Province but in transit from 
Dalian International Airport in Liaoning, PRC. They were 
stopped at the boarding gate by United Airlines staff while 
attempting to pass for four Taiwanese passengers on a flight 
that originated in Taipei, Taiwan and was destined for Los 
Angeles, California.  The PRC nationals received the 
boarding passes at Narita airport from the Taiwanese 
passengers who flew the first leg of the trip from Taipei to 
Tokyo.  After giving their boarding passes to the PRC 
nationals, the Taiwanese returned to Taipei the next day. 
 
¶2. The four Taiwanese bought their plane tickets after 
obtaining U.S. visas at the American Institute in Taiwan 
(AIT). Two of them applied for visas separately, 
approximately 10 days before they departed for Japan while 
the other two received their visas several months in 
advance. A review of their original visa applications shows 
that this group included both men and women, ages 30 to 45. 
All four stated they were going to Los Angeles for tourism 
and staying at different local hotels.  None of the 
applications contained any information that would have 
differentiated them from legitimate visa applicants; in 
fact, two had prior U.S. visas and apparent prior legitimate 
travel to the U.S.  Two of the applicants appear to be 
neighbors, and a clear indication of a connection between 
the applicants is the fact that the applications were all 
prepared by the same travel agency. 
 
¶3. AIT has cancelled the four visas of the Taiwanese and 
entered them as alien smugglers (6E) in the CLASS lookout 
system. The PRC nationals, after being questioned by 
Japanese immigration officials, presented their Chinese 
passports.  Using the biodata from those passports, they 
have also been entered into the CLASS system as having made 
false claims to U.S. citizenship (P6C2). FPU has also 
alerted all interviewing officers about this case so they 
can pay particular attention to any applications prepared by 
the same travel agency.  FPU will also initiate an 
investigation into this travel agency to determine whether 
there is a larger pattern of involvement with alien 
smuggling.  AIT has provided the information on the visa 
applicants to Taiwan's Investigation Bureau of the Ministry 
of Justice, the local equivalent of the FBI and Taiwan 
authorities are in the process of contacting the four 
Taiwanese applicants and the travel agency involved.
