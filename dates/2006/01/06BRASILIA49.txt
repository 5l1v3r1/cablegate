REF: STATE 216191 
 
Classified By: Economic Counselor Bruce Williamson, reasons 1.4 (b) and 
 (d). 
 
(S/NF) Post has found no/no open source information, other 
than an Internet listing (www.lyngsat.com), confirming reftel 
information that the Amazonas Satellite is carrying Al-Manar 
television.  The lyngsat.com listing was in contrast to a 
December 29, 2005 statement on the website of a group calling 
itself the "Coalition Against Terrorist Media" 
(www.defenddemocracy.org) claiming that Amazonas satellite 
owner Hispamar had dropped Al-Manar after an appeal from the 
coalition.  Due to technical limitations, post's Public 
Affairs Section was unable to tune in to the Amazonas 
satellite directly to confirm whether it is re-broadcasting 
Al-Manar's signal.   Post did not find any listings for 
Al-Manar television in publicly available programming 
schedules of major cable television operators in Sao Paulo or 
Foz do Iguacu.
