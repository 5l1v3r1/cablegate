ELECTIONS 
 
 
¶1.  (U) Egyptian state media reported a January 28 phone call 
between President Mubarak and Palestinian President Mahmoud 
Abbas in which the Egyptian leader expressed hope that the 
Palestinians would "close ranks in the coming period" in 
order to push the peace process forward and achieve the 
aspirations of the Palestinian people for an independent 
state. 
 
¶2.  (U) Egyptian Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif told reporters 
upon his return from Davos that Egypt was capable of playing 
a key role with Israel and the Palestinians after the Hamas 
electoral victory since Egypt is one of a few countries that 
can talk to both Israel and the Palestinians.  Nazif urged 
all parties to respect the democratic choice of the 
Palestinian people and give the new government a chance. 
 
¶3.  (U) After meeting his counterpart from Thailand on 
January 29, Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit told 
reporters that Egypt would consider mediation between Hamas 
and Israel after formation of a new Palestinian government. 
Aboul Gheit said, however, that the formation of a government 
would take quite some time.  When asked about Hamas' 
rejection of the Roadmap and its refusal to recognize Israel, 
Aboul Gheit said these issues would be addressed by all 
relevant parties.  The Foreign Minister expressed hope that 
Europe would continue its assistance to the Palestinian 
Authority, and called for the international community to 
respect the will of the Palestinian people.  The new 
political reality in Palestine, he said, would help push 
forward the peace process.
