SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: CROSS-STRAIT TRADE 
 
 
Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies continued to focus 
their coverage December 6 on the upcoming Taipei and Kaohsiung 
mayoral races, and on the aftermath of a fatal bus crash near Tainan 
on Sunday.  News coverage also centered on the improved condition of 
Taichung Mayor Jason Hu's wife, who has remained in a coma since a 
serious car accident in late November.  The pro-independence 
"Liberty Times," Taiwan's largest-circulation daily, front-paged the 
results of its latest survey, which showed that KMT mayoral 
candidate Huang Chun-ying and DPP mayoral candidate Chen Chu now 
enjoy almost the same level of support (approximately 34 percent) in 
Kaohsiung.  The pro-status quo "China Times" reported on page four 
the results of its latest survey, which showed that support for KMT 
Taipei mayoral candidate Hau Lung-pin remained at 48 percent, while 
the approval rating for DPP Taipei mayoral candidate Frank Hsieh 
climbed to a new high of 22 percent.  In terms of editorials and 
commentaries, most papers editorialized on the upcoming mayoral 
elections.  But the "Liberty Times" editorial continued to focus on 
cross-Strait trade and urged the DPP government not to ease the 
restrictions on investment in China.  End summary. 
 
"Would the DPP Government Please Stop Doing Things That Will Pain 
Its Friends but Please Its Enemies?" 
 
The pro-independence "Liberty Times" [circulation: 600,000] 
editorialized (12/6): 
 
"... Let's look at the consequences of the proactive opening policy 
and [the government's decision] significantly to ease restrictions 
[on cross-Strait trade] over the past six years:  Taiwan's domestic 
investment rate stands at an average of one percent only, (while 
during the period of the 'No Haste, Be Patient' policy, the island's 
average domestic investment rate from 1995 to 1999 was 6.4 percent, 
a gap of nearly sixfold).  Taiwan's GDP growth also dropped from 4.3 
percent to 2 percent.  On what grounds can those hardcore officials 
who cater to China and who support westbound investments speak 
loudly about nonsense of 'opening and easing restrictions?'  Is it 
possible that 'wiping out the entire nation and unifying [with 
China]' is the ultimate goal of [Taiwan's] national economic policy? 
..."
