¶1.  According to UNDSS and AMIS officials, at approximately 5:30 
p.m. on December 9, Janjaweed shot and killed a shopkeeper in the El 
Fasher central market.  Youssif Kibir, Wali of North Darfur State, 
and his cabinet attempted to visit the market to assess the 
situation; Janjaweed fired upon their convoy, resulting in a second 
fatality and eight to ten injured.  After clashing with Government 
security forces, the Janjaweed departed El Fasher.  Approximately 
500-700 are camped five kilometers north-northeast of the town, 
according to an AU military observer.  The Janjaweed involved in the 
attack are described variously as "Chadian rebels" or "border 
intelligence forces," as though incorporated into Government 
security forces. 
 
¶2.  On December 10, the Government imposed a midnight to 3:00 p.m. 
curfew on all civilians in and surrounding El Fasher.  The curfew 
purportedly is designed to prevent demonstrations similar to those 
held in the aftermath of shootings of the week of December 3 
(reftels). 
 
¶3.  Alayaam Daily, an Arabic newspaper, reported that North Darfur 
State Wali Youssif Kibir and a group of his advisors, including the 
Police Commissioner, offered their resignations last night, citing 
their inability to maintain security and protect the citizens of El 
Fasher.  Their offers were not accepted.  On December 10, a 
high-level Government delegation, including Minister of Interior 
Zubair Bashir Taha, Minister of Defense Lt Gen. Abdul Rahim Mohamed 
Hussein, and Assistant to the President Dr. Nafie Ali Nafie visited 
El Fasher.  According to UNDSS, the delegation traveled to Jebel See 
to meet Arab militia leaders.
