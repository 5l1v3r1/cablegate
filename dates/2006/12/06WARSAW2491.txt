ISSUE (C-CN6-01612) 
 
REF: A. A: STATE 192093 
 
     ¶B. B: WARSAW 2462 
 
Embassy Warsaw has the following responses to Reftel A query: 
 
¶A. (SBU) EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS' REACTIONS TO RECENT AFGHAN 
DRUG ISSUES. 
 
--Post does not believe that these issues will impact GOP's 
perceptions about troops' roles in Afghanistan.  The GOP has 
committed 1,200 troops to the NATO force for 2007 and this 
commitment is unchanged. 
 
--Polish troops have thus far not been involved in 
counternarcotics efforts in Afghanistan and Post does not 
believe that recent issues will change this one way or the 
other. 
 
¶B. (U) AFGHANISTAN'S INCREASED OPIUM CULTIVATION IMPACT ON 
POLAND. 
 
-- Increased Afghan production has/has translated into 
increased heroin transit and usage in Poland.  During all of 
2005 Polish authorities seized 41.1 kg of heroin compared to 
77.3kg during just the first six months of 2006; in addition 
police seized 75kg in one bust last month.  Police and the 
local DEA office note increases in usage and transit of opium 
originating from Afghanistan in all forms. 
 
-- The Central Bureau of Investigations notes that heroin 
seized in Poland this year has been of extremely high 
quality.  The 75kg seizure noted above was pure heroin 
destined for Spain. 
 
-- Heroin is a drug of top concern regarding transit.  Police 
estimate that 70 percent of heroin in Poland is ultimately 
destined for another market.
