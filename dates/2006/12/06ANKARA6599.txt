In Today's Papers 
 
Turks Defy EU Efforts for Suspending Talks 
All papers report France and Germany are seeking a specific 
timetable, an 18-month deadline, for Turkey to open its ports and 
airports to Greek Cypriot traffic, although leaders Chirac and 
Merkel have been forced to moderate their hard line positions. 
Prime Minister Erdogan phoned Merkel, telling her to avoid a 
historic mistake by making new demands on Turkey, adding that the 
European Union has more to lose than Ankara if relations worsen. 
 
A senior source from the Turkish government told Radikal that like 
the EU, Ankara is preparing to put the brakes on relations, planning 
to slow down progress on political issues if there is no easing of 
the partial suspension of negotiations at the upcoming EU summit on 
December 14-15. 
 
"The negotiation process will be impacted but will continue," said 
visiting Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt after a meeting with 
his Turkish counterpart Abdullah Gul yesterday.  At a joint press 
briefing with Gul, Bildt said, "Turkey's modernization is the most 
significant process that Europe has.  We all know that it is not 
completed; there are still steps to be taken."  Bildt noted, "Turkey 
is not a neighbor of Denmark and Sweden.  Turkey is situated in a 
volatile and strategically significant region."  Gul said, "We think 
that in the end everybody will consider Turkey's membership talks 
from a strategic perspective." 
 
Papers carry an open letter sent by eight members of the House of 
Lords to The Daily Telegraph, which said, "The partial suspension of 
Turkey's accession to membership of the European Union is insulting 
to the Turkish people.  Turkey, a secular state and significant 
member of NATO, is now being driven away from Europe and toward 
Islamic fundamentalism."  Zaman says the MPs also asked the British 
government to launch direct flights to Turkish Cyprus, urging for an 
end to the international isolation of the north. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Turkey-EU 
 
Murat Yetkin commenting in the liberal-intellectual Radikal notes 
that Turkey has plans of its own for the direction of its EU entry 
process:  "The EU leaders' latest decision on postponement of the 
negotiations encouraged the government to be prepared to put the 
brakes on the EU-Turkey relationship.  Sources say that there is 
still debate in the government as to whether to announce these 
measures at the end of the summit on December 14-15, but they add 
that these measures will be noticed when they are implemented. 
Turkey's reaction to the possible postponement decision at the 
summit already worries the EU commission, and some leaders are 
already advising Turkey to continue the negotiations and to not 
react harshly, regardless of the decision coming out of the summit. 
 It is hard to guess whether it is going to be in Turkey's interest 
if the government decides to put the brakes on the EU-Turkey 
relations, but the issue is already n the government's agenda." 
 
Erdal Safak writing in the mass appeal Sabah suggests Turkey play 
the energy card:  "One of the priority items on Merkel's agenda when 
she takes over the term presidency of the EU is the energy issue. 
Because the EU has to develop a concrete partnership with the 
countries who produce energy and who transfer it. Azeri and 
Kazakhstan oil and natural gas can be transferred to Europe either 
through Russia or Turkey.  After last winter's problems with Russia, 
the EU prefers Turkey to be the transit country.  The energy issue 
is covered in the negotiations under chapter 15 and this chapter is 
not included among eight chapters to be postponed.  So why doesn't 
Turkey use this chapter 15 in response to the EU decision to 
postpone eight chapters and say 'I am postponing the energy 
integration with the EU'?  Maybe, this will resolve the issue."

Opposition, Business Circles Negative on Erdogan as President 
Hurriyet, Sabah, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Zaman and Yeni Safak:  On 
Tuesday, the Turkish opposition parties urged Prime Minister Recep 
Tayyip Erdogan to call an early general election, saying this would 
help defuse strains over secularism and the troubled ties with the 
EU.  "I urge Erdogan to display an honest and democratic attitude," 
said Deniz Baykal, leader of the main opposition CHP.  Baykal said 
he would not object if the general elections are in April and if the 
AKP wins again, Erdogan could move on to get elected president by 
the parliament in May.  Mehmet Agar, leader of the center-right DYP, 
also urged Erdogan to call an election in the spring.  A leading 
Turkish industrialist, Mustafa Koc said Erdogan's presidency 
abandoning AKP would create "serious consequences" for his party, 
lining up behind earlier remarks by another top businessprson, 
Guler Sabanci, who had said Erdogan staying in active politics, i.e. 
not the presidency, would be better for Turkey. 
 
Baser, Ralston to Meet in Europe 
Sabah reports Turkish and American special envoys for countering the 
PKK, retired generals Edip Baser and Joseph Ralston, are to hold 
"The PKK and Europe" meeting in a European city this month.  US and 
European terrorism experts will participate in the meeting. 
 
Pamuk Due in Sweden to Receive Nobel Prize 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Radikal and Cumhuriyet report Turkish 
novelist Orhan Pamuk will fly Wednesday with his daughter to 
Stockholm where he will be awarded the Nobel Prize for literature. 
Pamuk said before departing for Sweden that he would deliver a 
speech on Wednesday before receiving the prize Sunday.  The Turkish 
embassy in Stockholm is to host a luncheon and a reception in honor 
of Pamuk to which Turkish and Swedish media members, politicians and 
businessmen will be invited.  Sabah reports a sign posted on 
Stockholm streets, bus stops and commuter vehicles welcomed Pamuk, 
saying, "Dear Mr. Pamuk, as a small token of appreciation, we've 
registered pamukforpresident.se for you."
