SUBJECT: BANK OF ALEXANDRIA (BOA):  FINAL SALE EXECUTED 
 
REF:  Cairo 7059 
 
¶1.  (U) BOA Vice Chair Fatma Lotfi confirmed to econoff that the 
final sale of the bank was executed on the Cairo and Alexandria 
Stock Exchange (CASE) on December 12.  The CASE website indicated 
that 128 million shares traded on December 12 at LE 71.99/share 
($12.60), for a total value of LE 9.2 billion ($1.6 billion).  Lotfi 
indicated that late last week the new owner, Italy's SanPaolo, 
fulfilled the remaining clause in the sale contract and named eight 
of the ten members of the new board of directors.  The Central Bank 
approved the final sale December 11, but did not name the two GOE 
representatives on the board of directors. 
 
¶2.  (U) Contacts at the Ministry of Finance informed econoff that 
the GOE has not completed deliberations on use of the proceeds from 
the sale.  The most likely use, however, would be settlement of the 
non-performing loans (NPLs) of the remaining public banks.  Banque 
Misr Vice Chairman Mohamed Ozalp told econoff last week that he 
believed the GOE would settle Banque Misr's debts before those of 
the National Bank of Egypt (NBE).  Banque Misr and Banque du Caire 
are scheduled to merge by December 31, 2006.  The Central Bank wants 
the newly merged entity, which will retain the name Banque Misr, to 
start operating with a clean balance sheet before tackling the much 
larger NPL portfolio of NBE.  For the time being, the proceeds from 
BOA's sale will remain in the Central Bank, bringing the GOE's 
foreign currency reserves to $25 billion.
