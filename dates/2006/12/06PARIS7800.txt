DEMARCHE DELIVERED 
 
REF: STATE 198296 
 
¶1. (SBU) Poloff and Russian counterpart delivered reftel to 
Hughes de Longevialle, French deputy coordinator for the 
Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism. Longevialle 
welcomed the various papers and agreed to initiate an 
interagency process to develop possible French proposals for 
the plan of work and to examine the draft agenda.  While he 
was not confident they would accomplish this before December 
18, he assured us that the GOF would respond as soon as 
possible. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Longevialle expressed gratitude for the Points of 
Contact list and informed us that the GOF would be creating a 
technical point of contact for the Global Initiative and 
would keep us updated. 
 
¶3. (SBU) After briefly examining the agenda item concerning 
proposals for additional partner nations, Longevialle 
remarked that France and other EU countries remained 
interested in discussing the possibility of the EU's 
participation.  He added that an EU strategy to combat 
nuclear terrorism was already in existence, and that the EU 
could contribute substantively to the plan of work.
