Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  The Deputy Special Representative of the UN Secretary General 
and Resident/Humanitarian Coordinator (DSRSG/RC/HC) held a Donor 
Coordination Meeting on December 3 to introduce the joint UN, 
Government of National Unity (GNU), and Government of Southern Sudan 
(GOSS) plan to return 150,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) in 
Khartoum and other northern states to the south and the Three Areas 
in 2007.  An additional 48,000 persons are expected to return to 
these locations from areas of displacement elsewhere in Sudan.  The 
joint plan estimates that in 2007, a total of 625,000 IDPs and 
refugees will return to Southern Sudan either on their own or 
through return programs.  The UN Common Humanitarian Fund will 
target reintegration assistance in areas where returns are expected 
to have the greatest impact, rather than in areas expected to 
receive the largest number of returnees.  Additionally, the GNU 
cleared the 2007 UN Work Plan for Sudan and agreed to launch the 
plan on December 19 in Khartoum.  End summary. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Joint UN and Government Planning and Funding 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. The GNU, GOSS, and UN have completed planning for the return of 
150,000 IDPs in Khartoum and other northern states to southern 
states and the Three Areas.  An additional 48,000 people are 
expected to relocate from other areas of displacement to their 
places of origin:  15,000 to Blue Nile; 13,000 from South Darfur to 
Northern Bahr el Ghazal; 10,000 from Jonglei to Western Equatoria; 
and 10,000 from Western Bahr el Ghazal to Warab. 
 
¶3. The GOSS allocated USD 24 million for the return operation, 
including the purchase of 134 trucks.  The GOSS will transfer the 
trucks to a private company to operate, and will lease the trucks 
for the return program.  GOSS operational costs are estimated to be 
USD 6 million to 8 million. 
 
¶4. The GNU and the GOSS will contribute to the cost of the return 
program, including transportation for 115,000 IDPs from Khartoum and 
other northern states to Southern Sudan and Southern Kordofan.  The 
GNU also announced plans for rehabilitation of the railway and river 
transport system, as well as a comprehensive assessment of IDPs in 
northern states.  The GNU reaffirmed its commitments to support way 
stations, surveys, registrations, and efforts to improve the 
conditions in the areas of return.  The UN and its partners have 
committed to transportation assistance for 82,000 IDPs and 102,000 
refugees, in addition to support for the return process from 
departure to arrival.  Registration in Khartoum started on November 
19, 2006.  USAID representatives have noted long queues on some of 
the 35 registration stations in IDP camps around Khartoum. 
 
¶5. Based on current return statistics and findings of the 
International Organization for Migration's (IOM) "Survey of 
Intentions", undertaken from July to September 2006 in northern 
Sudan, planning assumptions include an estimated 325,000 spontaneous 
returns - meaning people who return on their own without 
participating in formal programs.  Overall, the joint plan for 
returns includes a total of 625,000 persons for 2007. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Security Threats Demand Flexibility 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶6. Recent events in Malakal temporarily interrupted IDP return 
travel on the Nile.  Current insecurity in  and around Ed Daein, 
South Darfur, halted return travel from Nyala to Northern Bahr el 
Ghazal.  The DSRSG/RC/HC stressed that these events and the overall 
fragility of the peace demand that donors grant maximum flexibility 
in the implementation of the return program, including changing 
return routes and means of transportation. 
 
---------------------- 
Return Tracking System 
---------------------- 
 
¶7. The DSRSG/RC/HC described the current IOM return tracking system 
as reasonably accurate for spontaneous returns on the river, but not 
on the road.  He assured the audience that the joint return plan 
includes increased monitoring by the 13 field teams comprising 75 
 
KHARTOUM 00002864  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
staff now being deployed in arrival areas.  Overall field staff 
presence will increase four-fold compared to 2005 levels.  Seventeen 
way stations are functioning; the return plan calls for a total of 
25 way stations.  Statistics for planned returns are expected to be 
accurate and spontaneous return tracking through IOM and partners 
will improve.  All returnees will receive the same assistance 
package, which includes food, supplies, seeds, and tools. 
Participants in return programs will receive the package at the 
beginning of their journey, while spontaneous returns will receive 
the package upon arrival. 
 
¶8. USAID/Sudan staff in Khartoum and Juba will monitor and report on 
improvements in the process for spontaneous returns and the 
implementation of this ambitious planned return program.
