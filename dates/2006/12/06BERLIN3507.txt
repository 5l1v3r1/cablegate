SUBJECT: GLOBAL INITIATIVE TO COMBAT NUCLEAR TERRORISM: 
DRAFT PLAN OF WORK AND DRAFT AGENDA PASSED TO GERMAN 
GOVERNMENT 
 
REF: STATE 198296 
 
¶1. (SBU) Global Affairs Officer and Russian Embassy Deputy 
Political Counselor Dmitri Cherkashin jointly delivered the 
Global Initiative (GI) draft Plan of Work and accompanying 
documents (ref) to officials from the German MFA's Division 
for International Energy and Nuclear Energy Policy December 
¶13.  The German officials thanked us for the documents, but 
also expressed reservations about being able to provide 
proposals for GI activities for the Plan of Work by the 
December 18 deadline. 
 
¶2. (SBU) German International Energy and Nuclear Energy 
Policy Division Deputy Office Director Christine Althauser 
and Desk Officers Joerg Polster and Oliver Polleti reported 
the German MFA had hosted an inter-agency meeting earlier on 
December 13 to discuss ideas for GI activities.  However, 
they had not reached any consensus.  According to Althauser 
and Polster, the unresolved issues are:  what kind of 
activities are achievable, which ministry or agency would 
have jurisdiction over which GI activities, and who would 
provide funding.  While acknowledging this situation, emboff 
and Russia's Cherkashin nonetheless urged the German 
Government to submit at least a rough proposal to the USG and 
Russian Government by December 18. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Polster added another unresolved issue for the 
German Government is the role of the European Commission. 
According to him, the German Government must consult the 
Commission because of the possibility of activities falling 
under the Commission's purview.  He also said that if the 
Commission has competencies, it may also fund the European GI 
partners' proposed activities.  Polster gave no indication 
whether consultations with the Commission would delay 
Germany's submission of proposals for GI activities. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Cherkashin said he hoped Germany plans to send a 
deputy secretary-level official to at least the February 12 
morning session of the second GI meeting.  Polster said he 
will stress the urgency of an appropriate level of 
representation but noted most of the appropriate officials 
have full schedules throughout 2007, due to Germany's G-8/EU 
presidencies. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Post will forward any German proposals for GI 
activities septel.
