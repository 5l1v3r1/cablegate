SUBJECT: FRANCE AVAILABLE FOR BILATERAL MEETINGS AT WILTON 
PARK NONPROLIFERATION CONFERENCE 
 
REF: STATE 197729 
 
We approached Arnaud Mentre, desk officer in the MFA's 
disarmament and non-proliferation bureau, December 12 to 
propose a bilateral meeting on the margins of the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Conference at Wilton Park, UK (reftel). 
Mentre said he would welcome a meeting with Christopher Ford, 
U.S. Special Representative for Nuclear Nonproliferation, at 
any time on December 20 following the day's scheduled 
sessions.  Mentre is the only representative from France who 
will attend the conference.  If that window does not work, he 
said he would rearrange his schedule to find another mutually 
convenient time.
