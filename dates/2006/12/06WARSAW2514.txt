ANNOUNCEMENT 
 
REF: SECSTATE 195012 
 
¶1. (U) Econoff delivered reftel demarche on December 6 to 
Sylwia Ciszewska, Director of the Air Transport Department 
and Malgorzata Alberti, Head of the International Agreements 
Division, both with the Civil Aviation Office (CAO).  The CAO 
had learned about the U.S. announcement from the European 
Commission earlier the same morning.  The CAO was 
appreciative that we informed them about the change, but was 
not deeply concerned.  Because Poland and the U.S. have an 
existing bilateral agreement, the CAO does not believe that 
U.S.-Polish relations in the aviation sector will be 
affected.  However, as a member of the EU, Poland realizes 
that the bilateral agreement is not in line with EU 
regulations and that completing a U.S. - EU Agreement is 
important.  The CAO also stated that the rulemaking on 
"actual control" of U.S. airlines is not a priority for 
Poland.  The CAO believes that negotiations between the U.S. 
and EU will resume shortly, and as Poland has been since the 
beginning, Poland will remain deeply involved and interested 
in the EU committee working on the negotiations. 
 
¶2. (U)  The demarche was also shared with the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, Jaroslaw Starzyk of the EU Department, 
Janusz Lacki, Law and Treaty Department and Andrzej 
Jaroszynski, Americas Department.  MFA had no comment.
