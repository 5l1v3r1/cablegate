(SBU)  Per reftel, we spoke with Karine Segura, director for the 
Ministry of Economy's office of International Financial Sanctions, 
about France's lists of terrorists and terrorist organizations.  She 
stated that the Ministry does publish lists on its website (see: 
http://www.minefi.gouv.fr/directions_services /dgtpe/ 
sanctions/sanctions.php) as well as in the Journel Officiel of the 
European Union (the equivalent of our Federal Register, see: 
http://ec.europa.eu/comm/external_relations/c fsp/ 
sanctions/index.htm), although these are not "national" lists since 
financial sanctions against terrorists are considered to be the 
competence of the European Union after the Treaty of Amsterdam.
