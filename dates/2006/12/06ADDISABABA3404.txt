MINISTRY VIEWS ON SOMALIA AND THE AU 
 
REF: STATE 200927 
 
¶1. (C)  In the course of a December 20 meeting with U.S. 
Ambassador to the African Union, Ethiopian 
Minister of State Dr. Tekeda Alemu stressed that Ethiopia 
looked for dialogue in good faith with the Islamic Courts in 
Somalia, but would not be committed to dialogue in the 
abstract.  Ethiopia's 
by nature a status quo power, Dr. Takeda said.  Ethiopia 
would gain no benefit from a military conflict in either 
Somalia or Eritrea, and its commitment to dialogue is second 
to none.  He admitted that Ethiopia had been concerned by 
June/July movement of ICU toward Baidoa, and thus had to take 
some action, but now Ethiopia was politically in a laid back 
attitude. 
 
¶2.  (C) Dr. Tekeda welcomed Ambassador into a network of good 
contacts, but would not speculate on future leadership of the 
AU, commenting only that terms of the Commission and the 
Annual Chair of the AU Assembly are coming to a close. He 
closed with the remark that he has a Doctorate in 
International Relations, thus has an affinity with Ambassador 
Courville, and that the AU becomes more of a focal point as 
Africa has now come into the mainstream of world affairs.
