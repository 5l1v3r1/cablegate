SUBJECT: EU-RUSSIA SUMMIT: FM TUOMIOJA'S SIDEBARS WITH 
BEZHUASHVILI AND LAVROV 
 
 
Classified By: POLCHIEF Gregory Thome for reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 
 
¶1. (C) On 29 November, DCM met with Finnish MFA Political 
Director Pilvi-Sisko Vierros Villeneuve and discussed FM 
Erkki Tuomioja's recent consultations with Georgian FM Gela 
Bezhuashvili and Russian FM Sergei Lavrov on the margins of 
the 24 November EU-Russia summit.  Though Tuomioja's initial 
goal of arranging a face to face meeting between the foreign 
ministers did not come to fruition, his bilateral meetings 
with each were productive and DCM welcomed his efforts. 
Vierros Villeneuve stated that the Finns already sensed in 
the conversation with Bezhuashvili a lowering of the 
temperature from the Tbilisi side; Georgia was beginning to 
speak less about Russian involvement in Georgian internal 
affairs and more about Tbilisi engaging its separatist 
regions. 
 
¶2. (C) Vierros Villeneuve also noted two positive, though 
unintended consequences of the recent escalation between 
Georgia and Russia: the Russian ban on Georgian wine forced 
Georgia to investigate other markets (including Finland), and 
it has brought greater EU and international attention to 
Georgia's "long-standing frustrations" with Moscow.  Finland 
in the future hopes to increase its level of involvement in 
Georgia both under EU auspices and bilaterally through "soft 
policies."  Vierros Villeneuve was also encouraged by the 
appointment of the new Georgian defense minister. 
 
¶3. (C) Vierros Villeneuve stated that Lavrov, in his 
bilateral meeting with Tuomioja, reiterated Putin's recent 
public statements on Georgia, and stated that Georgia's 
separatist regions were an internal matter for Georgia -- not 
an issue between Georgia and Russia.  As with the Georgian 
side, the Finns sensed a lowering of temperature and rhetoric 
from Moscow, but believed Lavrov had been sidelined in 
Georgian relations because of the Presidential 
Administration's apparent level of involvement.  "The issues 
are not in the hands of Lavrov -- they are very much with 
Putin," Vierros Villeneuve said.  The Finnish Presidency also 
sees the decrease in recent reports of harassment of 
Georgians in Russia as a positive sign.  Though Tuomioja's 
attempts to bring the two sides together were unsuccessful, 
the Finns appeared pleased with the results of their efforts.
