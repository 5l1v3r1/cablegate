¶1.  (U) SUMMARY: There was both good and bad news in 
the Tangi Returnee settlement this week.  It began 
with the delivery of the signed letter of intent to 
grant the land to the Returnees.  The excitement was 
dampened at the end of the week when two young members 
of the community were gravely injured by a landmine. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (U) On November 21, Nangarhar Governor Gul Agha 
Sherzai finally signed the long awaited letter of 
intent to give the land in Tangi to the Kunari 
returnees living there.  Reftel A describes this 
industrious group of former refugees and their efforts 
to develop this barren land and to organize a thriving 
community over the past year.  They are a model of 
what a motivated group can accomplish.  The signing of 
the long promised letter gives the returnees the right 
to establish a more permanent settlement, as opposed 
to the current temporary camp. The signing had been 
repeatedly delayed for a variety of reasons outlined 
in Reftel B. 
 
¶3.  (U) The PRT delivered the letter to the settlement 
on November 25 as well as explained to the elders of 
the village the next steps they should take to improve 
their living conditions.  The PRT also translated the 
letter and gave a copy to the UNHCR.  With this letter 
from the Nangarhar governor, the PRT, UNHCR, and other 
aid organizations can provide assistance for a more 
permanent development and for shelter.  It should also 
help to reduce the threats against the community, as 
described in Reftel B.  In spite of the profuse thanks 
for the efforts of the PRT, the Commander emphasized 
that it is the Afghan government and not the PRT that 
has made this possible.  The role of Deputy Minister 
of Refugees and Repatriation Abdul Qadeer Ahadi, 
alerted to the Tangi situation by embassy RefCoord on 
October 31, was not mentioned but clearly played a 
role in moving the resolution forward so quickly. 
 
¶4.  (U) In a tragic turn of events, on December 1, one 
young person from the settlement was killed and 
another gravely injured by a landmine.  The two had 
been digging on land near the settlement when they 
accidentally detonated a mine.  Their family brought 
the injured to the PRT.  One boy, estimated to be 
about 15 years old, was dead by the time he arrived. 
A medevac helicopter was called for the second boy, 
but the PRT medic determined that he needed immediate 
attention if he was to survive, so he was taken to the 
Jalalabad Hospital.  He did survive, but lost an eye 
and has multiple wounds. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) It is well known that there are mines in the 
areas around the settlement, and there are mine 
clearing operations underway in several spots.  These 
two young people are related to a girl injured in a 
similar incident last year.  It is unclear whether 
they had been sent to look for items to salvage and 
sell or were digging for some other reason.
