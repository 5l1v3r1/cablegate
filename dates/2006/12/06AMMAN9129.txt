SUBJECT: Lab Standards for Iraq to Emerge from Biological Risk 
Workshop 
 
REF: Amman 2916 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary: A dozen Iraqi scientists attended a Department of 
Energy-sponsored workshop in Amman December 18-20 on reducing safety 
and security risks at biological labs.  The workshop was put on by 
staff from Sandia National Laboratories (SNL).  The workshop 
introduced current best practices and technology for running safe 
and secure labs.  It also helped to establish a network among top 
Iraqi biologists.  Next, two senior Iraqi biologists, working 
closely with the Iraqi Biosafety Committee and SNL, will begin to 
draft national biosafety/biosecurity guidelines for Iraq.  End 
Summary.

Workshop Builds on Prior Training, Needs 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (U) The December 18-20 biological risks workshop was a direct 
outcome of the July 2006 workshop in Jordan for Iraqi scientists on 
animal health surveillance and molecular diagnosis.  During that 
workshop, participants recognized and commented on their need for 
further training in safe and secure lab procedures.  Sandia also 
held a regional biosafety workshop in Amman in February 2006. 
 
¶3.  (U) Sandia staffers Dr. Donato Aceto and Paula Austin 
facilitated the December 2006 workshop, and gave presentations on 
international biological threats, risk assessment, threat reduction, 
elements of biosecurity and biosafety, and global practices.  Iraqi 
participants made a series of presentations on their individual 
institutions, practices, plans and needs. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Comment: The December workshop lent much-needed support to 
the embattled scientific leaders of Iraq, as well as raising their 
ability to reduce risks from biological agents.  End Comment. 
 
¶5.  (U) This message has been cleared by Dr. Donato Aceto.
