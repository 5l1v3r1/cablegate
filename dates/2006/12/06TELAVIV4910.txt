REF: STATE 195365 
 
¶1.  In response to reftel talking points, the Israeli 
Ministry of Health provided the following information to ESTH 
Officer:  In Israel, there are several legal drugs containing 
dronabinol, sold under the brand names "merinol", "nabilon" 
and "ronabin".  All of these can be prescribed by any medical 
doctor without need for additional permits or approvals.  Ten 
years ago, a pharmaceutical company in Israel produced one of 
the three drugs containing dronabinol, but that firm 
discontinued production due to lack of demand.  Although 
there is a potential for abuse of these drugs, MOH has seen 
evidence of this.  MOH issues specific permits for medicinal 
use of cannabis.  Patients who earlier used one of the 
aforementioned brand name drugs containing dronabinol and 
later received a permit allowing them to smoke cannabis 
reported that the former were less potent in all aspects. 
 
¶2.  MOH did not have a position on the specific WHO 
recommendations noted reftel.  Post will be pleased to 
coordinate further with the GOI on this matter as the USG 
finalizes its position.
