REF: KABUL 5284 
 
 ¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: In what should be considered a positive 
start, the first class of Afghan National Auxiliary Police 
(ANAP) graduated in Lashkar Gah, Helmand Province, on 
November 16.  DynCorp trainers reported that the training 
went smoothly and that the 100 trainees were enthusiastic and 
performed well.  Drawn from eight districts, the ANAP were 
then deployed to three districts, with many of the graduates 
being assigned to man checkpoints.  The second class 
graduated on November 30.  Training expanded to neighboring 
Nahri Sarraj district on November 25, where 57 recruits have 
nearly completed the course.  After some confusion, recruits 
from Musa Qala district joined the class in Lashkar Gah that 
commenced on December 2.  The only significant problem 
encountered has been getting the ANAP paid, a problem 
officials report has been resolved.  END SUMMARY. 
 
One hundred graduates deployed to three districts 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Following the inaugural course in Qalat in October 
(REFTEL), the first class of Afghan National Auxiliary Police 
(ANAP) graduated in Lashkar Gah (LKG), Helmand Province, on 
November 16.  Starting on November 4, one hundred recruits 
(of a starting class of 102, the other two fell ill and were 
scheduled to resume training in the next class) received a 
basic introduction to police work from a MOI syllabus, 
including conflict techniques, weapons familiarization, 
checkpoint operation and field sanitation.  Graduates also 
received equipment (uniform, weapon and ammunition).  The 
training was conducted by DynCorp and Ministry of Interior 
(MOI) trainers, with assistance from PRT military personnel. 
DynCorp trainers described the recruits as enthusiastic about 
training, and said they performed well; the trainers also 
reported only a few logistical problems (e.g., no food for 
one day of training). 
 
¶3. (SBU) The trainees, drawn from eight districts, were 
mostly raw, though some obviously had familiarity with 
weapons.  The recruiting process stemmed from an agreement 
between Chief of Police General Nabijan, the MOI and tribal 
leaders, with Nabijan and the MOI seeking assurances from the 
tribal leaders that the recruits will observe the police 
chain of command and the rule of law, otherwise they would be 
expelled. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Though the idea is to recruit locally and send back 
ANAP loyal to their communities and therefore less likely to 
engage in extortion (the reputation of the Afghan National 
Police (ANP) in Helmand is one of corruption), Nabijan will 
be able to distribute ANAP across Helmand, within limits set 
for each district.  The graduates of the first class will not 
all be deployed to their own districts, with most going to 
Garmser district (south of LKG), some to the LKG reserve and 
smaller numbers to Nawa-I-Barakzayi (central district) and 
LKG district center.  Many of the graduates are being used to 
man checkpoints. 
 
¶5. (SBU) At the end of their year contract ANAP course 
graduates can apply for a year,s extension or apply to the 
regular ANP.  During their year in the ANAP they will receive 
one week of refresher training every three months, a 
modification of the initial course. 
 
Musa Qala recruits arrive for training 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Training continues in LKG, with two classes already 
graduated (221 total) and the third underway.  This third 
class has approximately 160 recruits, and includes 20 from 
Musa Qala district, where local leaders struck a deal with 
the provincial governor government about providing for their 
own security.  Local leaders from the district accompanied 
the recruits for the first day, and later expressed an 
interest in sending additional recruits to future classes.

Training expands to second district 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Training expanded to Nahri Sarraj, the district 
immediately to the north of LKG, on November 25 with 
approximately 60 participating.  Due to security concerns in 
the district, the training in Nahri Sarraj is being conducted 
by UK military and two DynCorp trainers. (NOTE: The only 
recruitment center is in Lashkar Gah.  The ANP is looking 
into sending ANP up to Nahri Sarraj to recruit there.  END 
NOTE.) 
 
Recurring problem:  Salary nonpayment 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan,s 
(CSTC-A) Police Reform Directorate (PRD) finance team has 
included Helmand in its notably successful phased effort to 
establish a direct pay system nationwide that would ensure 
reliable payment of monthly salaries to individual policemen. 
 Payment under this system initially envisions using a 
Ministry of Finance (MOF) agent, followed later by direct 
payments through a Lashkar Gah bank.  Electronic funds 
transfers into individual bank accounts are the ultimate 
goal.  In the November 23 ANP staff meeting in Lashkar Gah, 
director for training and education said that the ANAP had 
not yet been paid, and blamed the MOF for the delay.  ANP 
officials promise that in the next pay period those ANAP 
should receive both regular and back pay. 
 
¶9.  (SBU) In the months ahead, the hiring of security guards 
related to infrastructure projects in northern Helmand could 
present an attractive and lucrative alternative to the ANAP. 
Nabijan is aware of this, and will work with tribal leaders 
to prevent defections and hold ANAP to their year-long 
contracts. 
 
¶10.  (SBU) COMMENT:  The initial training course should be 
judged a success.  The only significant problem arising, 
nonpayment of salary, has been a chronic problem in Helmand. 
A resolution seems at hand, hopefully an enduring one.  END 
COMMENT.
