 ¶1.  Econ Chief visited Solenta DHL at Abidjan airport as 
requested in reftel to inquire into application number 
D366138 registered on 10/26/2006 (OEA/532 M.Hames/Doris 
Johnson) for a attitude inertial sensor, model 7003360-946. 
 
¶2.  Econ Chief spoke to Business Development Manager Helen 
Bergounioux (French citizen) and her South African citizen 
chief mechanic (M. Botha) and visited one of the ATR 42/72 
aircraft Solenta maintains. 
 
¶3.  Solenta DHL appears to be a very suitable purchaser of 
said equipment.  The company performs all the maintenance on 
DHL's fleet of 4 ATR 42-72 aircraft operating in West Africa 
(Note:  DHL has the contract to transport US State Dept. 
pouches.  End Note).  Solenta has a spare 7003360-946 in 
stock, under lock and key, and is ordering it so it is on 
hand should one of the aircraft in the fleet require a 
replacement.  Each of the four ATR 42-72s flies over 250 
hours per month, causing substantial wear and tear and the 
maintenance of a continuous stock of key replacement parts. 
Solenta's HQ in Johannesburg purchases all of the replacement 
parts and distributes them to its operations throughout 
Africa. 
 
¶4. Solenta's management was very open and cooperative with 
Econ Chief and FCS LES.
