¶1. (SBU) Summary.  The Dutch hosted a workshop on November 
25 and 26 that will make recommendations on animal vaccine 
strategy to the Ministry of Agriculture.  The local 
television station Lativi began broadcasting AI mini- 
documentaries on November 10 and will continue these 
broadcasts through the end of the year.  Food and 
Agricultural Organization (FAO) representatives joined a 
Ministry of Agriculture Advisory Group and urged regular 
release of poultry outbreak information to the international 
community, public and local media.  Experts from USAID and 
other donor organizations spent the week of November 27 
developing an operational research plan for effective 
interventions for AI control in animals. As of December 1, 
the PDS/PDR program has expanded to cover 75 districts.  On 
November 30, a local newspaper published an article briefly 
describing the Tangerang trilateral project that will be 
implemented next year.  Although no new cases have been 
confirmed since November 12, an AI patient hospitalized 
since November 11 died on November 28 raising Indonesian AI 
fatalities to 57.  As of December 1, NAMRU-2 data reflects 
74 confirmed cases with 57 fatalities.  End Summary. 
 
Dutch Host Vaccine Strategies Workshop 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) The Embassy of the Netherlands held a conference on 
November 25 and 26 entitled, "Workshop on Strategy 
Development for the Introduction of a DIVA (Differentiate 
Infected from Vaccinated Animals) Principle".  The 
objectives of the workshop were to review experiences and 
progress to date of DIVA; recommend to the Ministry of 
Agriculture vaccination strategies; discuss the roles and 
responsibilities of stakeholders; and develop a road map 
with implementation timeframes.  The conference reported on 
initial test results on the efficacy of locally produced 
vaccines.  The benchmark for protection of poultry after two 
vaccines is set at 80 percent (i.e. 80% of birds are 
protected.)  The research carried out to dates suggests that 
the locally produced vaccine tested appears to be falling 
below this benchmark.  Currently, there are 12 local and 
imported vaccines registered for use for poultry in 
Indonesia. 
 
Lativi Broadcasts AI Documentaries 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) Lativi, one Indonesia's fastest growing commercial TV 
stations began broadcasting AI documentaries on November 10 
and will continue through the end of this year.  The station 
started with a series of 2-3 mini-documentaries and plans to 
broadcast two 30-minute documentaries during the week of 
December 18. Approximately seven million reviewers 
throughout Indonesia watch Lativi regularly.  The Lativi 
programs have been high quality. 
 
FAO Reps Join Ministry of Agriculture Advisory Group 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶4. (U) In October 2006, the Minister of Agriculture agreed 
to restructure the Central Management Unit for AI Control 
(CMU) to include technical expertise from the FAO. On 
November 6, the restructured CMU met and discussed the draft 
work plan for 2007 and the need for releasing AI outbreak 
information.  FAO representatives urged the Ministry to 
release Participatory Disease Surveillance/Participatory 
Disease Response (PDS/PDR) weekly outbreak information to 
the international community and set up a system for regular 
release of information to the public.  In presenting the 
draft 2007 workplan, Dr. Elly Sawitri Siregar, the CMU 
Director, praised the USG for its support for the PDS/PDR 
program, citing the program's contributions to surveillance 
capacity, disease understanding, and informed decision- 
making.  The 2007 work plan includes the establishment of 
Local Disease Control Centers in every Indonesian province. 
 
USAID Tech Assistance to MOA/FAO for AI Control in Animals 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
¶5. (U) Experts from USAID and other donor organizations 
spent the week of November 27 in Jakarta developing an 
operational research plan for implementing and validating 
the most effective interventions for AI control in animals. 
The plan will test the effectiveness of culling with and 
without compensation, ring vaccination, and preventive 
vaccination in sector 4 (backyard) chickens.  USAID is 
partnering with the World Bank to provide financial support 
to implement these activities, conduct further evaluations 
and provide feedback to the GOI in 2007. 
 
6.(U) As of December 1, 2006, the PDS/PDR program has 
expanded to cover 75 districts.  The program is on schedule 
to cover all districts (159) on the islands of Java and Bali 
and two provinces on the island of Sumatra by June 2007. 
 
Indonesia Newspaper Reports on Tangerang Pilot Project 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶7. (U) On November 30, Seputar Indonesia, a local newspaper 
ran a story on the Tangerang Pilot project reporting that 
the Government of Indonesia is preparing a pilot project to 
handle the spread of bird flu.  MOA bird flu Emergency 
Response Team Chief Delima Hasri Azahari said the pilot 
project would be concentrated in Tangerang and would involve 
a team of researchers that will begin conducting 
examinations in the field next year. According to Azahari, 
"We hope this project will serve as an example for other 
regions, especially regions with bird flu." 
 
NAMRU-2 Human AI Case Profile 
----------------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) NAMRU-2 reports no new human cases in the past two 
weeks.  However, a 35-year-old female from Tangerang who had 
been hospitalized for bird flu at RSPI Hospital in Jakarta 
since November 11 died on November 28 of what is believed to 
be a hospital acquired infection.  This death raised 
Indonesia AI fatalities to 57.  NAMRU-2 data indicates the 
following AI-related case profile as of December 1: 
 
-- Number of laboratory confirmed (positive PCR and/or 
serology) human AI cases: 74, of which 57 have been fatal 
(case fatality rate of 79 percent). 
 
-- Number of probable AI cases 3 (2 deaths, 67%). 
 
-- Number of cases awaiting analysis at the U.S. CDC: 0. 
 
-- Number of possible untested AI cases under investigation 
(last 30 days): approximately 16. 
 
Note: NAMRU-2 data corresponds with MOH data but may vary at 
times with AI case figures presented on the official World 
Health Organization (WHO) website, which usually lags NAMRU- 
2 data by one week.  The WHO website, last updated on 
November 29, notes 74 human AI cases in Indonesia with 57 
deaths.  WHO figures can be accessed at 
www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza.
