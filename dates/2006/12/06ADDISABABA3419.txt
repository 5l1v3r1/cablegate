¶1.  (SBU) On December 26, the Emergency Action Committee (EAC) met 
to review the general security situation in Ethiopia as well as 
post's general security posture.  The following offices were 
represented at the EAC: Charge, A/DCM, PE, DATT, USAID, USAU, CONS, 
RMO, ORA, CDC, MGT, GSO, A/PAO, MSG and RSO. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The EAC discussed the following issues: 
 
-- The ongoing situation between Ethiopia and Somalia.  Between 
December 24-26, the Government of Ethiopia (GOE) publicly 
acknowledged sustained military operations in Somalia against 
extreme elements of the Council of Islamic Courts (CIC). 
 
-- Related security concerns, including the general security 
situation within Addis Ababa and the rest of Ethiopia. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The EAC briefly discussed the issue of the Saddam Hussein 
verdict. However, the general consensus among key EAC members is the 
Saddam Hussein verdict and Iraq has little or no interest within 
Ethiopia.  The focus of interest within Ethiopia is as follows: 
 
--The on-going situation between Somalia and Ethiopia and possible 
reprisals within Ethiopia; 
 
--The on-going border dispute situation between Ethiopia and 
Eritrea; 
 
--The general internal economic, political and security situation 
within Ethiopia; 
 
Local press coverage of the Saddam Hussein verdict has been minimal. 
Local public sentiment and interest in this matter is also minimal. 
 
 
¶4.  (SBU)The current situation in Addis Ababa remains normal and 
permissive. However, the EAC approved and released a general warden 
message (approved by the Department), advising the public of 
Ethiopian military operations along the border and in Somalia, and 
repeating cautionary information from the Consular Information 
Sheet. This information already advises Americans to be cautious and 
vigilant due to the elevated threat within Addis Ababa due to 
possible reprisals regarding the Ethiopia - Somalia situation. 
Additional warnings would be redundant. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The RSO has already carefully examine our already strong 
security posture, and made necessary adjustments.  In the coming 
days, we hope to begin work on extensive physical security 
improvements to the highly visible and accessed gate to the Embassy 
compound. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The primary EAC members are in daily contact with each 
other, and will convene another EAC regarding the Saddam Hussein 
verdict and Iraq if the situation merits it.
