¶1. The National Assembly voted December 6 to reauthorize the 
Armenia's troop deployment to Iraq.  The 85-19 vote followed 
two days of vigorous debate, and the personal appearance of 
Defense Minister Serzh Sargsian who debated with some 
skeptical deputies the wisdom of the deployment on the 
parliament floor.  Sargsian portrayed Armenia's continued 
deployment as important to maintaining Armenia's credibility 
as a reliable partner of the United States and the 
international community.  He also pointed out that Armenia's 
contribution is modest in comparison to the troop deployments 
of regional rivals Azerbaijan and Georgia, each of which have 
sent both larger contingents and combatant troops to Iraq. 
The junior governing coalition partner, the nationalist ARF 
Dashnaktsutyun party, joined the parties of the "Justice" 
opposition alliance in opposition to the deployment 
extension. The ARF concern is that Armenia's deployment 
potentially endangers ethnic-Armenian minority populations in 
nearby Arab states, in which the U.S.-led troop presence in 
Iraq is unpopular. 
 
¶2. Armenia's contingent of almost 50 soldiers 
(doctors/medics, deminers, and truck drivers) are attached to 
the Polish-commanded Multi-National Division-Central South 
(MND-CS).  Armenia is on its fourth six-month troop rotation 
in Iraq.  Armenia suffered its first Iraq casualty November 
11, when First Lieutenant Nalbandian lost part of a leg to an 
IED attack (Ref B). 
 
¶3. COMMENT:  Sargsian's recent Iraq visit to the Armenian 
troops and with U.S. and Iraqi commanders (Ref C) enhanced 
both his personal commitment and domestic political 
credibility on the Iraq deployment issue.  Sargsian's ruling 
Republican Party's overwhelming control of the National 
Assembly, combined with Sargsian's personal backing, led to 
the lopsided vote in favor of the deployment extension.  The 
outcome belies a significant strain of skepticism among 
Armenian parliamentarians, and generally negative public 
opinion, about the wisdom of putting Armenian troops into 
harm's way in Iraq.
