REF: KHARTOUM 02807 
 
¶1. (SBU) During a December 7 meeting with ambassadors at the 
African Union Darfur Peace Agreement Implementation Office, 
Senior Assistant to the President and Sudan Liberation 
Movement (SLM) leader Minni Minawi affirmed his commitment to 
the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA), but pleaded with the 
international community to support him in his efforts to 
establish peace in Darfur.  "Our choice is the Abuja peace 
agreement," said Minawi.  "We believe the Darfur Peace 
Agreement is the way to get people to peace...but we cannot 
take the authority that is needed without the international 
community."  Minawi indicated that the SLM could not continue 
to limp along in the face of attacks by the Sudanese Armed 
Forces (SAF), the Janjaweed, and the DPA non-signatories. 
"Where is the international community's support?  What is 
your idea for promoting peace in Darfur?" questioned Minawi. 
"My concern is the dignity and peacefulness of my people as 
soon as possible, and I need your help."

NCP, Sudan-Chad Rivalry Cause Crisis 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (SBU) Minawi disputed the assertion that the crisis in 
Darfur was a "tribal war," saying that the tribes had been 
living together for "5,000 to 6,000 years."  Instead, he 
blamed the National Congress Party (NCP) for arming some 
groups against others in an attempt to create "facts on the 
ground" and on the tensions between the Sudanese and Chadian 
governments.  He said that the Sudanese-Chadian tensions and 
Chadian support for the National Redemption Front (NRF), 
Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), and the G-19 would need 
to be addressed in order to end the Darfur crisis.  One of 
Minawi's advisors also noted the influence of the Arab 
Gathering--a shadowy movement that seeks to create an Arab 
crescent throughout the Sahel--and said that its adherents in 
the Sudanese government were working with Arab militias to 
advance the Gathering's goals by 2020.  (Note:  As reported 
reftel, this same advisor described this issue in a December 
6 conversation with Embassy staff.  End note.)

CDA Calls for Emergency CFC 
--------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) CDA Hume said that the USG shared Minawi's concerns 
about the Sudanese government's disingenuous efforts to 
implement the DPA and said that the NCP's plan to stabilize 
the security situation in Darfur by force had clearly failed. 
 He called for an emergency session of both the Cease-fire 
Commission (CFC) and the Joint Commission (JC), which 
received support from Minawi and the other ambassadors. 
French Ambassador Christine Robichon noted that a CFC meeting 
would provide an opportunity for the two-chamber structure of 
the CFC, which would include DPA non-signatories, to be 
activated.  Head of the European Commission Delegation Kent 
Degerfelt said that the international community would be 
unable to provide financial support for recovery and 
development in Darfur until an effective cease-fire mechanism 
was in place.  (Note: AU Deputy Head of DPA Implementation 
Amb. Boubou Niang said that meetings of the CFC and the JC 
would be scheduled soon, both possibly in El Fasher.  End 
note.)  CDA Hume also asked Minawi's advisor to provide a 
brief on the Arab Gathering for the ambassadors, most of whom 
were unaware of it.  He agreed to do so on a bilateral basis. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Negotiations with Non-Signatories 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Minawi voiced his concern that DPA non-signatory 
leaders were negotiating separate agreements with the 
Sudanese government and called these "pieces of peace."  He 
claimed that these discussions were being used by the NCP to 
undermine the agreement, and he emphasized that as a 
signatory to the DPA, SLM/Minawi should be included in the 
negotiations.  "If there are any good ideas for supporting 
this peace--politically and financially--I think it will go 
forward and other non-signatories will join," said Minawi. 
He also reiterated his support for an international 
peace-keeping force in Darfur, though one of his advisors 
added that the "intensive consultations" between the United 
Nations (UN) and the Sudanese government regarding such a 
force should be more inclusive of the SLM/Minawi.  Minawi 
suggested, however, that in the face of international 
inaction and continuing violence by the NRF and Janjaweed, 
 
KHARTOUM 00002811  002 OF 002 
 
 
the SLM/Minawi would move to create a joint force for the 
protection of civilians.  He did not elaborate on the 
structure of such a force.
