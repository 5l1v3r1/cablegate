Six-Party Talks to Restart December 18 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. MFA Spokesperson Qin Gang announced in the regular 
December 12 press briefing that the Six-Party Talks 
will resume December 18 at the Diaoyutai State 
Guesthouse in Beijing and will include bilateral and 
multilateral meetings.  Qin said that the Joint 
Statement of September 19, 2005 will provide a basis 
for the renewed negotiations.  Asked how China would 
define the success of the Talks, Qin said success 
would depend on the negotiations moving toward the 
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and the peace 
and stability of Northeast Asia. 
 
¶3. Asked by the Straits Times reporter if China has 
any constructive suggestions similar to "the aid 
package" proposed by EAP Assistant Secretary Hill, Qin 
said only that parties will discuss issues of concern 
once the Talks resume.  Qin also deflected questions 
on whether or not changes in United States or DPRK 
positions had led to the resumption of the Talks and 
on what other working group meetings would be held 
during the Talks. 
 
U.S.-China Trade Issues and Strategic Dialogue 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶4. Responding to a reporter's question about criticism 
in the United States over China's WTO record, Qin said 
China has worked in earnest over the last five years 
to implement the WTO agreement and follow the WTO 
rules while opening its markets.  The United States- 
China relationship is based on broad common interests 
and any issues that may arise can be resolved through 
fair and friendly means.  Qin stated that the first 
Strategic Economic Dialogue is an opportunity to 
increase mutual understanding and promote bilateral 
trade cooperation, but did not provide a schedule or 
meeting information when asked by reporters. 
 
China Does Not Engage in "Money Diplomacy" in Africa 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶5. Responding to a question on reports that China was

in return for Chad's severing of diplomatic relations 
with Taiwan and recognition of China with the 
President of Senegal as a mediator, Qin said that 
China does not engage in "money diplomacy."  On the 
contrary, the "Taiwan authorities" do make use of such 
practices, which create instability in some countries, 
he said.  Based on the one China principle, equality 
and mutual benefit, China is ready to develop further 
cooperation with other nations, said Qin.  The visit 
of Premier Su Tseng-Chang of Taiwan to Gambia from 
December 13-17 was mentioned in the same question. 
Qin reiterated China's strong opposition to activities 
of the "Taiwan authorities" aimed at separating Taiwan 
from China as well as the hope that relevant countries 
will abide by the one China principle recognized by 
the international community. 
 
Imprisoned Uighur is a Chinese Citizen and a Terrorist 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶6. Qin insisted that Huseyin Celil, a Canadian citizen 
of the Muslim Uighur ethnic minority currently jailed 
by China, is a Chinese citizen and a terrorist, who is 
suspected of involvement in terrorist activities and 
whose case is under trial in accordance with law, Qin 
said when asked if Celil would be executed.  China 
hopes Canada can support China's handling of terrorism 
in accordance with the law. 
 
ASEAN Postponement; India and Japan in Asia 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. Responding to a reporter's question regarding PM 
Wen Jiabao's plans to attend the postponed ASEAN 
Summit meeting, Qin said that China understands the 
necessity of the postponement and will consult with 
the relevant parties to discuss whether PM Wen will 
travel to the Philippines to attend future meetings. 
Asked to comment on Indian PM Singh's upcoming visit 
to Japan, Qin said the matter was an internal affair 
of the two countries.  He stressed that China, India 
and Japan play important roles in the peace and 
prosperity of Asia.  China hopes for expanded dialogue 
and exchanges to create a new concept of regional 
stability and development cooperation. 
 
Beijing Hosts Israel-Palestine Talks 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶8. At the invitation of FM Li Zhaoxing, former 
Palestinian National Authority Minister Abdel Qadir 
and former Israeli Justice Minister Beilin will travel 
to Beijing from December 14-17 to meet with FM Li, AFM 
Zhai Jun and Chinese experts on the Middle East. 
Replying to reporters' questions, Qin said that China 
fully supports the peace process and that this may be 
the first time China has hosted such a meeting. 
 
China supports UNSC Resolutions on Nagorno-Karabakh 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶9. China supports resolutions of the United Nations 
Security Council regarding the Nagorno-Karabakh Region 
of Azerbaijan, Qin said when asked for comment on a 
referendum backing independence in the region.  Qin 
expressed China's hope that the parties concerned can 
find a proper solution in accordance with 
international norms recognized by all, adding that 
China is willing to make joint efforts with the 
international community for a peaceful solution.

advancement, said Qin, offering no comment on 
questions about reports on Pinochet's death. 
 
Chinese Dinosaur Fossils Must Return Home 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶11. Qin expressed China's concern over a recent report 
that a dinosaur fossil auctioned by a United States 
company might have originated in China.  If the 
ongoing investigation confirms this report, China will 
demand the fossil's return in accordance with relevant 
international conventions.
