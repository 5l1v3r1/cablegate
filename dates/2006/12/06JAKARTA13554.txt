SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERED: UAE/UN-HOSTED GLOBAL 
CONFERENCE; MARCH 2007 
 
REF: STATE 197226 
 
¶1. (U) We met December 21 with Deputy Minister for Child 
Protection in the Ministry of Women Empowerment, Ms. Sumarni 
Dawam Rahardjo, to deliver the demarche contained in reftel. 
Ms. Rahardjo fully agreed with all the points in reftel, 
particularly noting the importance of holding the 
international conference on trafficking in persons in the 
Middle East because of the trafficking issues Indonesia faces 
in sending workers to that region.  She had not yet seen the 
invitation but we gave her details about the conference and 
the website where she could go for more information.  Ms. 
Sumarni immediately responded that Indonesia should send a 
senior-level representative to the conference. 
 
¶2. (U) We will follow up in January to confirm what further 
action Ms. Sumarni has taken and who is likely to attend the 
conference.
