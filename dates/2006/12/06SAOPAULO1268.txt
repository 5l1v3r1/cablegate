"Personal Diplomacy" 
 
The lead editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (12/15) 
maintained: "Personal diplomacy, when directly conducted by the 
President in contact with other chiefs of state and government, may 
be a powerful and worthwhile  foreign policy tool.... When the 
presidential diplomacy only reflects the chief of the government's 
interests or idiosyncrasies or those of the group advising him, then 
the result is almost always disastrous.  President Lula had the best 
conditions to perform an efficient personal diplomacy.... But after 
four years, what we have is a foreign policy tied to old fashioned 
concepts. They are remnants of old misconceptions and formulas that 
remind one to the climate of confrontation between blocs that was 
typical of the cold War and has no justification in the 
globalization era. Such a foreign policy was drafted in accordance 
with the peculiar way President Lula and his close advisors - 
concerned in carrying out a foreign policy independent from the US 
and the EU - see the world.... President Lula is too reverent and 
subject to humiliations imposed by Colonel Hugo Chvez, who is the 
self-proclaimed successor of Fidel Castro as the leader in the fight 
against American imperialism.... Last week, the wish of not 
displeasing African nations and not giving the impression of 
alignment with the European nations led Brazilian diplomacy to 
assume a shameful posture at the UN Human Rights Council examining 
the situation in Darfur.... Looking for reciprocity, which in this 
case is expected to become trade in the areas of oil and sugar, the 
GOB not only separated from the Western nations, but got distanced 
itself from decency."
