SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: PRESIDENT CHEN SHUI-BIAN 
 
 
Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies gave significant 
reporting and editorial coverage December 28 to President Chen 
Shui-bian's son-in-law, who was sentenced to six years in prison and 
fined NT$30 million Wednesday for his involvement in insider trading 
in the Taiwan Development Company case.  Coverage also focused on 
the trial of the Presidential Office Allowance for State Affairs 
case, and the aftermath of the strong earthquake that rocked 
southern Taiwan Tuesday.  In terms of editorials and commentaries, 
an "Apple Daily" column discussed President Chen Shui-bian's current 
status.  The article predicated that Chen will struggle between his 
dual roles as lawyer for the defendant and as president during the 
remainder of his term.  End summary. 
 
"A-Bian Comes Alive Again" 
 
Columnist Antonio Chiang commented in his column in the 
mass-circulation "Apple Daily" [circulation: 500,000] (12/28): 
 
"... A-Bian came alive again in the wake of the Taipei and Kaohsiung 
mayoral elections.  Acting step by step and with great care, he 
resumed execution of his presidential authority by tossing off a 
plan to re-nominate the Control Yuan members and by appointing a 
group of two and three-star generals and admirals.  His next step is 
to nominate the Grand Justices and the State Public 
Prosecutor-General, and he is likely to visit Central America and 
Africa early next year.  It appears as if the previous glory has 
returned. 
 
"When on his ebb tide, A-Bian once announced that he would 
relinquish some of his presidential powers.  But he has made too 
many promises, and he may not really mean what he says sometimes. 
Besides, to relinquish some of his powers does not include the 
powers granted to him by the Constitution; he will still try his 
best to execute these powers as long as he remains in office.  As 
offense and defense is currently being played out in court over the 
Presidential Office Allowance for State Affairs case, in which Chen 
is allegedly involved, and as the Presidential Office Allowance for 
State Affairs case as well as the declaration of assets by public 
officials are all duties under the purview of the Control Yuan, it 
may involve conflicts of interest and thus rob A-Bian of his 
legitimacy if he wants to nominate the Control Yuan members now. 
The DPP filed for constitutional interpretation from the Grand 
Justices over the Presidential Office Allowance for State Affairs 
case.  But since the Grand Justices will be nominated by A-Bian, 
whose interests are obviously at stake, it will be very difficult to 
convince the public, no matter how unbiased Bian claims his position 
is. 
 
"A-Bian played the role of lawyer for the defendant while fighting 
for his and his family's cases, but in the meantime, he played the 
role as the president when he delivered a speech at the 
Investigation Bureau, appointed senior military officers, and 
nominated the Control Yuan members.  Still, quite a few people in 
Taiwan's society regard him as a defendant and accomplice and refuse 
to acknowledge him as president.  A-Bian still has more than one 
year of his remaining term of office, and he will surely struggle 
between his roles of lawyer and president.  For him, this will be a 
test of will, but for Taiwan's society, it will be an unnecessary 
torture."
