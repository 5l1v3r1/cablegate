SUBJECT: DECEMBER 28 MFA PRESS BRIEFING: SCO SYG ZHANG 
DEGUANG, SIX-PARTY TALKS, CHINA-JAPAN HISTORY STUDY 
 
¶1. Key Points at the December 28 MFA Press Conference were: 
 
--Outgoing Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Secretary 
General (SYG) Zhang Deguang was pragmatic and helped launch 
the organization and raise its international profile.  China 
expects similar pragmatism from Zhang's successor, Bolat 
Nurgaliyev. 
 
--China will implement United Nations Security Council 
Resolution 1718 responsibly.  The United States and the DPRK 
should resolve their differences on financial measures 
through dialogue and help facilitate the Six-Party Talks. 
 
--At the just concluded China-Japan Joint Historical Study 
meetings, China and Japan agreed upon procedures for future 
meetings and agreed to hold a second meeting in Tokyo in 
March, 2007. 
 
New SCO Secretary General 
------------------------- 
 
¶2. Asked to comment on outgoing SCO SYG Zhang's tenure, MFA 
Spokesman Qin Gang said that Zhang worked hard as the first 
SCO SYG to launch the organization.  During Zhang's tenure, 
SCO developed efficient and orderly coordination among member 
states that increased political trust and cooperation.  Zhang 
also helped the SCO have an international impact.  SCO member 
states' leaders view Zhang's tenure as highly pragmatic. 
China looks forward to close cooperation with incoming SCO 
SYG Bolat Nurgaliyev, who will make new efforts to increase 
pragmatic coordination among SCO members, Qin said. 
 
Six-Party Talks 
--------------- 
 
¶3. Asked to comment on reports that ROK sources said the DPRK 
will "give up" its nuclear facility at Yongbyon if the United 
States lifts its economic measures against the DPRK, Qin said 
the United States and the DPRK discussed the financial 
measures during the recent Six-Party Talks and both sides 
expressed their positions.  China hopes the United States and 
the DPRK can resolve their differences through dialogue and 
cooperation and facilitate the Six-Party Talks process. 
 
¶4. Questioned what China has done to implement United Nations 
Security Council Resolution 1718, Qin said that UNSCR 1718 is 
a UNSC action and the UNSC is entitled to take further 
decisions.  As a responsible member of the Security Council, 
China will responsibly implement UNSCR 1718.  The Security 
Council is currently researching implementation, Qin added. 
 
China-Japan History Study 
------------------------- 
 
¶5. Responding to questions about the recent China-Japan Joint 
Historical Study meetings, Qin said that the first meeting 
ended on December 27 and both sides agreed to act in 
accordance with the &three political documents8 (the 
China-Japan Joint Communique, the Treaty of Peace and 
Friendship and the China-Japan Joint Declaration) and the 
framework agreed upon in Hanoi in November, 2006.  China and 
Japan agreed to face up to history for the benefit of future 
generations.  China hopes this spirit will be carried out 
throughout the process.  The two sides set up procedures for 
the next meetings and divided discussions into ancient 
history and modern history.  A second meeting will be held in 
Tokyo in March, 2007.  Scholars and governments must abide by 
the objective facts of history and take a responsible 
attitude toward history, Qin remarked.  Responding to a 
general question about differing perceptions of World War II, 
Qin said verdicts rendered at the international trials at the 
conclusion of World War II were clearly stated and 
undeniable.  Japan accepted surrender with no conditions. 
Japan's own laws state that Japan must abide by international 
treaties and international law, Qin said. 
 
China Israel Relations 
---------------------- 
 
¶6. China and Israel conduct exchanges at all levels in all 
fields, Qin said when queried whether Israeli Prime Minister 
Ehud Olmert will visit China soon.  Qin added he had no 
additional information about Olmert's possible visit. 
 
Premier's Travel Not Fixed 
-------------------------- 
 
¶7. Asked about Premier Wen Jiabao's possible travel plans for 
the rescheduled Tenth ASEAN 1 Summit and/or Japan, Qin said 
China supports the Philippines and will communicate with the 
ASEAN parties and make a prompt announcement when 
 
BEIJING 00024852  002 OF 002 
 
 
appropriate.  China and Japan have agreed in principle to a 
visit by the Chinese leader at a time convenient to both 
sides and will consult through diplomatic channels.  China 
will announce any such visit when it is fixed, Qin noted.
